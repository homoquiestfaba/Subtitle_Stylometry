1
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,792
So what happened?

2
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:29,194
- There? Right there?
- -Hm-mm. Yup.

3
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,401
The scouting report.

4
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,736
What was that report?

5
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:43,208
That he's better
than most pitchers
at the plate.

6
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:47,746
Can't lay down a bunt,
can't throw it hard and inside,

7
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:49,481
because he's got
some bad speed.

8
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:50,716
Ah.

9
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,318
And instead of an easy out,

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,721
like you would have
with most pitchers,

11
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,456
you actually had to work
for this one.

12
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:01,827
Hm, maybe
that was exasperating
to you.

13
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:04,763
After facing all these
good hitters,

14
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,099
you don't even get
an easy out
with the pitcher.

15
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:13,505
Is this what you do
in here?

16
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:17,342
I mean, is this, is this
what you do with players,

17
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:18,444
you review tape?

18
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:20,112
Is this what we are gonna do
all week?

19
00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:22,681
My instructions were to calm
you down for the playoffs.

20
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:25,451
Yeah, so are we gonna
just watch a tape or...

21
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:27,920
No, that's what
we are doing now.

22
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:30,856
Tomorrow, it'll be different.

23
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,024
Is that okay with you, man?

24
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:33,058
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

25
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,193
Yeah, you are the coach.

26
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:35,427
Okay.

27
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,196
Ah.

28
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:40,299
You remember
anything else specific?

29
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:42,534
Yeah, I remember
I'm about to throw
five wild pitches and

30
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:45,104
make a fucking ass
out of myself in front
of the entire world.

31
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:46,705
Yeah, I remember that.

32
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:48,140
Oh, I got that.

33
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,944
But do you remember
what you were thinking,

34
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:54,379
and what you felt
in this moment?

35
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:58,717
Um...

36
00:02:03,424 --> 00:02:09,294
I, I heard this guy
in the crowd,

37
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,363
he was a vendor.
I heard him yell "coke."

38
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:14,800
You ever do coke?

39
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,239
No.

40
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:23,242
What kind of a question
is that?

41
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:25,544
Just flowing with it.

42
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:32,151
Just keeping it loose...
All right, let's stick
with this, uh, soda guy.

43
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:34,753
That must have been
pretty loud for you
to hear it over the crowd.

44
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:39,291
Yeah, but when I'm focused,
whenever I'm...You know,

45
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:42,594
I don't even hear
the guy next to me.

46
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:44,830
He could be saying
something and I won't
even hear him.

47
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,099
But right before this pitch,

48
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:48,534
I remember
i heard the coke guy,

49
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:51,603
I heard little noises
in the crowd.

50
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:54,206
Sandy koufax said
when he lost focus,

51
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:57,943
he would see the crowd,
not the catcher.

52
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:59,611
-Koufax said that?
-Uh-huh.

53
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,380
-Really?
-Yeah.

54
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:03,282
You are not the first
pitcher to have this problem,
you know, man.

55
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:04,483
Yeah, I know, Howard glass.

56
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:06,218
- You're not so special.

57
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:09,454
-I know Howard glass
had this, right?
-Mm.

58
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:12,658
And he started throwing,
he threw strikes.

59
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,127
Woke up one day,
couldn't throw any strikes,
never threw again.

60
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:18,030
Ah, a lot of pitchers
struggle with control
when they are young.

61
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:19,531
Yeah.

62
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,401
-Hey, he killed himself, right?
He hung himself.
-Hm-mm.

63
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:23,969
You didn't work with him,
did you?

64
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:25,470
No, not really.

65
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:26,538
Yeah.

66
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,241
Is there a name
for what he had?

67
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,643
Yeah, there's plenty of names

68
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,912
but I don't subscribe
to any of those.

69
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,915
Why not?

70
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,717
Don't want to legitimize it.

71
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,887
This is a passing
thing for you.

72
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,458
And you give it a name,
it might wanna stick around.

73
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,597
-Yeah?
-Mm.

74
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,298
Mm-hm.

75
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,734
All right.

76
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:59,838
Well, I think we are about
out of time for today.

77
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,307
Do you have any other question
you want to ask me, though?

78
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,648
Do you prescribe medication
in here?

79
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:11,950
What's the problem?

80
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,956
I, uh...

81
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:22,361
I haven't slept
in like three days.

82
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:25,197
I don't sleep so good,
you know. I mean I can,

83
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,200
but I have these bad dreams,

84
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:32,137
so I... need something
to knock me out maybe.

85
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,641
Let's try and see
if we can handle that
without meds for now.

86
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:37,643
-Okay.
-Okay?

87
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,444
All right. Fine.

88
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,546
Also, I'll tell you my memory
is a little bit foggy.

89
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,282
I don't remember
things so well.

90
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,385
Um, you know.

91
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:49,288
Memory is a funny business.

92
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:53,792
And sometimes
we fog over the past,

93
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:55,861
because of damage.

94
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,497
Yeah.

95
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:00,432
You know,
like in the old movies

96
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:02,301
when they put vaseline
on the camera lens

97
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:05,504
to make the faces
prettier and softer,
you know?

98
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:09,308
Yeah, I'm not damaged.
I mean I, I'm not damaged
at all.

99
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,777
Some things I remember
very clearly.

100
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,245
-You know.
-Okay.

101
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:15,113
-But some things I don't.
-Okay.

102
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,381
Yeah.

103
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,671
<i> This is a kid who</i>
<i> comes into the game</i>

104
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,573
<i> with six wins, no losses,</i>

105
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,443
<i> for 2.03 era.</i>

106
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:53,545
<i> A terrific strikeout</i>
<i> to walk ratio</i>

107
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:56,381
<i> which makes what happened</i>
<i> all the more strange.</i>

108
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,617
<i> Well, yeah.</i>

109
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:00,552
<i> We have to be a little</i>
<i> concerned with the rookie</i>
<i> at this point, anyway.</i>

110
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:03,054
<i> I mean,</i>
<i> throwing five wild pitches</i>

111
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:06,425
<i> in one inning</i>
<i> on national television</i>
<i> to boot.</i>

112
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:08,427
<i> You know he must be</i>
<i> in a state of shock.</i>

113
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:12,197
<i> I mean, this is a kid</i>
<i> who's never had any</i>
<i> control issues at all.</i>

114
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,232
<i> You are absolutely</i>
<i> right about that.</i>

115
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,468
<i> The kid is known</i>
<i> for pinpoint accuracy</i>

116
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,537
<i> and, well, frankly</i>
<i> a fast bowler</i>

117
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:19,871
<i> that the gods</i>
<i> would be jealous of.</i>

118
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,240
<i> The gods being Nolan Ryan</i>
<i> and,</i>

119
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,810
<i>Walter "the big train" Johnson.</i>

120
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:26,878
<i> You know,</i>
<i> I hope the kid's okay.</i>

121
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,780
Hopper, Rachel cullum
with sport net.

122
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,916
Could you tell us
what happened out there?

123
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,217
Hopper, right here.

124
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,777
That agent who wants
to rep you, Scott...

125
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,713
-Hm-mm.
-He sent me his portfolio
of the house.

126
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:37,015
He thinks I should move in,
five miles
from Jensen beach.

127
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,017
I asked him to do that.
What do you think?

128
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,788
I can't believe it.
It's a fucking castle.

129
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,490
Well believe it, mom,
'cause it's yours.

130
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:47,125
Just in your name,
just for you.

131
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:50,729
Castle makes me nervous, hop.

132
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:53,632
Don't be nervous,
just enjoy it.
Look at this.

133
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,300
Look at that pool.

134
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,635
You like swimming, right?

135
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,570
No, you like swimming.

136
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:00,639
Ever since you saw
<i> the little mermaid.</i>

137
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,974
--I'm scared of sharks.

138
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,911
-Sharks in the pool, really?
-At night, yeah.

139
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:08,647
I'm always terrified
there's gonna be sharks
in a dark pool.

140
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,016
-I know it's not likely.
-It's not likely at all.

141
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,518
But you know what,
you can just turn
the pool lights on.

142
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,953
There's lights all over it.

143
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,122
--Mom.

144
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:19,558
Just enjoy it.

145
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,893
I'll try, hop.
I really will try.

146
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:23,828
It's a mansion though, right?

147
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,397
-Yeah.
-It's a fucking mansion.

148
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,501
You like it?

149
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:31,670
Yeah, they cut the lawn
so nice, too.

150
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:06,705
You think your baseball coach
is going to get you out of this?

151
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,740
-No, ma'am.
-Good.

152
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,008
'Cause he's not.

153
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,043
I don't play by those rules.

154
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,712
I don't care if you
are the big jock
around here,

155
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,814
you still have to study
when it comes to my class.

156
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,616
Yes, ma'am.

157
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:23,588
I know those big league
scouts are all over the place.
I see them.

158
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,056
You'll have more money
in a year from now

159
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:30,462
than I'll have in...
All my lifetimes.

160
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:34,866
But you and I both know
that does not change
one undeniable fact.

161
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,036
Ma'am?

162
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,339
You know I know your daddy?

163
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,377
You do?

164
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,315
We were at school
here, together.

165
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:56,187
He was a real piece of work.

166
00:10:57,324 --> 00:11:00,025
An expert at cutting corners.

167
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:01,926
When there weren't
any corners left,

168
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,361
he'd make circles around her.

169
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:09,334
I was hoping
he hadn't taught you
that trick.

170
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,838
Well, I'm not trying
to make excuses, Ms. epland,

171
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:19,944
but sometimes, I find it
a little difficult to balance
baseball and homework.

172
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,117
Now, you listen to me.

173
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:31,189
When you're gifted
with a talent like you are,

174
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:33,858
people will say, "wow,

175
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36,494
that's pretty nifty."

176
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:39,497
And they'll tell you
honestly that it can change
your life,

177
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:42,133
lead you
to inconceivable realms.

178
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,969
But you have to work

179
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:48,206
at bringing the rest
of your person
up to that level.

180
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,144
If you only do
what comes easy to you,
what you are good at,

181
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,013
you are just
an untrained thoroughbred,

182
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:58,116
which isn't a race horse,
at all.

183
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,118
It's a wild animal.

184
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,457
I'm using sports metaphor
so that you can understand,

185
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:07,892
junior.

186
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,449
Yo, what's up, hopper?

187
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,428
Uh, Dorothy was telling us

188
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:48,833
that you are trying
to decide between college
and being a professional.

189
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,169
Yeah.

190
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:57,742
I know my college education
is important, but
at the same time...

191
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,010
Mm, nonsense.

192
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:02,714
I mean, when those colleges
start giving kids a share

193
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:04,215
of all the money
they are making
off of them.

194
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,251
Then maybe
but as it is,
it's absurd.

195
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:09,788
I mean, the ncaa's
completely corrupt.

196
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,056
Who's that guy,
at Duke?

197
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:14,592
The one at Duke
that they are paying
ten million dollars a year

198
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:15,794
to coach a basketball team.

199
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,228
Coach k, absolutely.

200
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,997
Yeah, these coaches
making a million dollars

201
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,633
while the players
get nothing, it should
be illegal.

202
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:22,934
And so should
the major league drafts.

203
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,803
All drafts should be illegal.

204
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,138
You want to sign
with the Yankees,

205
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,973
you should be able
to sign with Yankees,
don't you think?

206
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,075
I've never really
thought about it before.

207
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,977
All drafts should be illegal.

208
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,450
I don't think Yankees
would be my first pick.

209
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:40,518
Why not?

210
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:44,823
Well, you know,
New York.

211
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,960
All those people,
all that money.

212
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,929
Isn't money important to you?

213
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:53,131
Yeah, money is important
to me but,

214
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:55,266
only enough to take care
of my mom

215
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:58,169
and I don't have to put up
with those steinbrenner kids.

216
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:01,072
Talk to the socialist.

217
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,276
What's a socialist?

218
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,948
It's a person who believes
in a system where there's
no private property.

219
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,616
Oh, that's not me. No.

220
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:14,319
I want to buy my mom a house.

221
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:16,187
Of course.

222
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,056
You're still a ball player,
after all.

223
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:21,192
I mean you couldn't throw
all those strikes
if you were a complete marxist.

224
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:23,895
Exactly.

225
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:26,297
When I grew up,
athletes were political.

226
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,132
They wanted to be like
Muhammad Ali.

227
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:30,635
Nowadays, you want
to be like Michael jordon.

228
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:34,539
Hollow billionaire. They're
capitalists. No heart or love
in what they do.

229
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:36,875
Lebron went back to Cleveland.

230
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,677
There was love in that move.
Kevin love.

231
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,312
Ba-dum-pum

232
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,484
did I tell you the one
about the polar bear
and rabbit?

233
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,419
-Oh, the polar bear
and the rabbi?
-Rabbit.

234
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:52,724
Uh, uh, hold it.
Lebron, are you ready
for dessert?

235
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,659
I just called you lebron,
didn't I?

236
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:57,896
Because I love the game.

237
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,998
Oh, hopper, are you ready
for dessert?

238
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
- No, you can call me lebron.

239
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:04,135
You can call me lebron.
I like it.

240
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:07,005
My parents,
they loved you.

241
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:10,508
Really?

242
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,579
-I'm not used to talking
like that at dinner at all.
-Yeah?

243
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:18,283
-What's it like at your house?
-My house? At dinner?

244
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:23,021
I always sit in front
of the TV.

245
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:25,590
We eat, we don't
really say anything.

246
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,025
My mom works all the time.

247
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:28,960
She is in real estate.
My dad he's...

248
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,596
He's away.

249
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,333
Your family is so smart.

250
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,902
You're smart.

251
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,637
You're going to be
a valedictorian

252
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,472
you got all
the Chinese kids beat.

253
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,809
I'm just good at studying,
that's all.

254
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,778
I'm terrible at studying.

255
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,080
My mom says I have add.

256
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:51,316
How do you focus
when you're on the mound?

257
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:55,620
I just forget about everything.

258
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:12,730
Hopper,
come on in for a second.

259
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:17,101
-Sunflower seed?
-No, thank you.

260
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,975
How is the change up
coming along?

261
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:27,545
Mm-mm. I don't know.
Sometimes I think
I'm getting it, and then...

262
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:29,380
Yeah.

263
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,251
There's not really
anything to get.

264
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:34,986
You just can't blow up,
you know.

265
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:36,387
Yeah, I guess.

266
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,457
I heard your dad's
coming back this week.

267
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,393
Yup.

268
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,665
Is that what you wanted
to talk to me about?

269
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,601
-Is he going to stay
with you and your mom?
-Yeah, I think so.

270
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:53,571
-How do you feel about him
coming back?
-I feel great about it.

271
00:17:57,844 --> 00:18:00,144
-Real fucking cocksucker.
-Yeah.

272
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:03,581
My dad rides me
pretty damn hard.

273
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,316
I know he does.

274
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,620
He rides me hard too.

275
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,622
He tells me all the time
not to watch the pitch count,

276
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,124
'cause it's going
to make you soft.

277
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:14,425
A dime a dozen.

278
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,127
He's a piece of work,
your pop.

279
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:18,763
Yeah,
he thinks you are,

280
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,365
he thinks you're slow too

281
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:24,135
because you didn't take
that third base coaching gig
at fsu.

282
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,672
-That's what he said?
-That's what he said.

283
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,943
You are doing really good.

284
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,911
-Yeah.
-Staying out of trouble.

285
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,446
I'm trying really hard.

286
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:40,284
And I like Dorothy.
That's a good girl.

287
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,253
-Yeah.
-She's got sturdy head
over her shoulders.

288
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,889
It seems to me you've been
in the pink since you been
with her. A lot better

289
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:47,825
than with the last one,
i forgot her name
right now.

290
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,427
I think it was something
"d" name.

291
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:51,629
-Doreen.
-Doreen.

292
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:55,500
Any girl going to math class,

293
00:18:55,502 --> 00:19:00,171
puts on that much mascara,
she does not like herself
very much.

294
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:02,573
--Anybody puts on
that kind of mask,

295
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,809
they unintentionally
expose themselves.

296
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,746
Are you listening?

297
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,114
-I can't tell with you
if you are listening.
-I'm listening.

298
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:11,749
-Are you?
-Yeah, yeah.

299
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,193
This is bananas.

300
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:25,329
I think your mom
took that picture.

301
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,999
High school yearbook.

302
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,700
I was the yearbook editor.

303
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:34,172
I found that last night,
going through the garage.

304
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:39,210
He was a really gifted player,
could have gone pro.

305
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:42,380
He's sick.

306
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,284
You know, he hit a lot
of doubles, that's what
he says.

307
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:47,685
He's a doubles hitter.

308
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,287
Doubles?

309
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,922
Double vodka,
double soda.

310
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:56,827
Senior year he started
showing up to practice
late and tired and high,

311
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,730
new tattoos all the time,
and then by the end
of the season,

312
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:02,466
he just simply
wasn't showing up at all.

313
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:04,368
He said he got...

314
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,638
Kicked off the time
for brawling.

315
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,275
There was a bad brawl,
but he never got kicked off
the team.

316
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:15,246
In fact, I remember
the coaches actually liked it

317
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:17,481
that he threw punches
in the brawl, because
it's the only time

318
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:20,885
they'd seen him
with any pep all year.

319
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,925
Didn't even know that was it.
That was it.

320
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:30,928
That would be his past-time
from then on, fracas.

321
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,936
I got to go, coach.
Dorothy is waiting for me.

322
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,238
Look at me.

323
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:42,807
Be astute.

324
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:46,844
If late at night,

325
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:49,180
trouble comes knocking...

326
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:51,816
At your door,
do yourself a favor,

327
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:53,584
stay in bed.

328
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,419
Yeah.

329
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,823
Go say hi to Dorothy.

330
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:01,792
So, I have another joke.

331
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:04,362
I went to zoo
the other day.

332
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:05,763
But there was only a dog.

333
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:07,632
It was a shih tzu.

334
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:10,434
Why do you like mayonnaise
on your fries?

335
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,236
Try it, you might like it.

336
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:14,205
Mm, no, I'll take my chances.

337
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:16,307
You never take the chance.

338
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:19,377
Whenever we go out,
you always sit in the corner,

339
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:20,711
with your back
to the wall,

340
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:22,480
like you are afraid
of your own shadow.

341
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:25,416
Like the nutcracker cornered
when the mouse king.

342
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:28,986
It's the best spot.
You can see everything coming.

343
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:33,291
If there's a scout
over there, spying on me
then I know it.

344
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:35,893
And if there's any
trouble coming,
i know it.

345
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:38,529
But, then you
never get surprised.

346
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,732
Yeah, well,
surprises are overrated.

347
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:42,800
Hi, y'all.

348
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:48,239
So.

349
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:49,340
Hey.

350
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:50,708
What did coach have to say?

351
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,780
Why do you care
what my coach had to say?

352
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:57,715
Because I care about you.

353
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:05,990
Do you have any idea
how much pressure
i am under right now?

354
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:08,292
I'm only trying to help.

355
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:11,762
I know, but, I mean,

356
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:15,800
I'm the number three
ranked prospect
in the country.

357
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:17,702
Number one pitcher.

358
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:21,072
You have any idea what kind
of pressure that is?

359
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:26,610
Well, who do you think

360
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:28,813
has the best
grade point average
in the school?

361
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:30,881
There is not nearly
as much as rivalry.

362
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:33,284
Yeah, but if I want to go
to a great college,

363
00:22:33,286 --> 00:22:34,785
then I need to get
a scholarship.

364
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,721
I'm talking about
millions and millions
of dollars.

365
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:39,757
I'm talking about being famous.
I'm talking about being
a professional athlete.

366
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:44,862
You know that a shih tzu
is a toy dog, right?

367
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,297
- What are you talking about?

368
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:48,866
Shih tzu and a shit zoo.

369
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:50,234
Come on.

370
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:52,002
And you are telling
jokes right now?

371
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:54,305
-It's only baseball.
-I just...

372
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:56,807
That's the dumbest thing
you've ever said.

373
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:00,378
It's not just baseball.

374
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:06,550
You know what? I'm gonna home.
You're hurting my feelings.

375
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,053
You really need to toughen up.

376
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,190
-No, I don't.
-Yeah, you do.

377
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:16,160
No, I don't need to toughen up,
because that's a stupid goal.

378
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:17,328
Survival of the fittest.

379
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,330
Yeah, it's called
social darwinism.

380
00:23:19,332 --> 00:23:23,667
And you are scared
that if you can't throw
a ball perfectly, then you...

381
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:25,436
And you think
everybody's nice.

382
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:27,671
Okay, well, that's not
how it works.

383
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:30,708
Everybody is using everybody
all the time. Period.

384
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,877
-You using me?
-Yes, I'm using you.

385
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:35,246
Of course, I'm using you.
You're using me.
That's how it works.

386
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:38,616
You are a cute little
odd ball that I pass
my time with.

387
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:45,756
You think because
you can throw a baseball,

388
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:51,095
that you are special
in some kind of
real, non-secular way.

389
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,697
-Non-secular, what do you
mean by that?
-Well, it doesn't.

390
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:59,303
Worshiping these false
American idols,

391
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:01,038
and people just
buying into this

392
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,606
Harry Potter syndrome,

393
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,708
like wanting to have
a fucking lightning bolt
on their forehead,

394
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,377
do you really believe
in any of that?

395
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:09,213
Because nobody is more special
than anybody else.

396
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:11,649
I mean like, duh and...

397
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:17,121
You know what?
I really wanna go.

398
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:43,147
How's your arm?

399
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,057
It's fine.

400
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:57,795
Got some new ink.

401
00:24:57,797 --> 00:24:59,096
Yeah, I was bored.

402
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:04,368
Must have hurt
getting it that dark, huh?

403
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,603
Pain is just weakness...

404
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:07,004
...leaving the body, yeah.

405
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,942
Have you grown at all?

406
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:15,012
I don't think you've grown
even a little bit in the year
since I've seen you.

407
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,483
Inch and a half.

408
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:22,653
You haven't grown a
inch and a half. Bullshit.

409
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:26,891
Look at you. You're thin
like a Reed. You don't have
any muscle on you at all.

410
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:31,295
You know the market's got
the undetectable steroids
again.

411
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:32,763
You might
wanna check that out.

412
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:38,936
How's the, how's the great
coach Eddie, yeah?

413
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:41,572
He still think he's got
all the answers

414
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:43,240
'cause he had a cup of coffee
at the majors?

415
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:46,310
Hm? Didn't have what
it takes to stick

416
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:49,046
so he's been sticking
to everybody else since,
right?

417
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:51,849
He had what it takes.

418
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:54,251
Batted 307
before he got injured.

419
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,288
Yeah. Running into a wall.

420
00:25:58,324 --> 00:26:00,057
That's a brainy baby for ya.

421
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,893
Now he's got a job
working in a school,
getting paid diddly squat.

422
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:05,029
That's a loser's game.

423
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:07,164
And he plays it 'cause
he likes losing.

424
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,600
Like the...

425
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:13,003
Freaks on the block
who get their kicks

426
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:15,906
while getting banged around.
No, thank you.

427
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:20,811
You tell him, I say hi.

428
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,252
Well, you got here
just in time.

429
00:26:29,522 --> 00:26:30,955
Who's playing?

430
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:33,524
Fuck that. You just got here
in time to get me a bear.

431
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:34,758
Take the edge off.

432
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:36,827
Appreciate it.

433
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,940
-Is mom home?
-Why, you wanna cry
to her?

434
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:53,777
No, just wondering
if she got home
from work yet.

435
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,213
-You know.
-Hey, sit down.

436
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:57,715
No, I got homework.

437
00:26:57,717 --> 00:26:59,216
No!
I know you don't have any homework,

438
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:00,718
little liar face.

439
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,753
Huh, you don't have the
brains for homework.

440
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:05,389
Get your ass, your scrawny ass
to sit down on the couch.

441
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:07,458
You don't have any
homework, hey.

442
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,227
You actually want
to make me stand up

443
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:12,963
and come over there
and sit your scrawny ass down.

444
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,733
Is that what you want?
I don't think so, slim.

445
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:27,144
I can't believe all these
scouts are buzzing around
a little toothpick like you.

446
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,580
I mean that is full blown
craziness right there.

447
00:27:29,582 --> 00:27:31,415
I threw 98 miles an hour
on Saturday.

448
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:34,652
-Did you throw
98 miles an hour?
-Ninety-eight miles an hour.

449
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:38,689
Wow, you must think you're
pretty astonishing.

450
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,564
Huh?

451
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:47,965
-You can tell me.
It's all right.
-No, sir.

452
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:51,935
-Well, come on, you can tell me.
It will be our secret.
-No, sir.

453
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:54,038
You think
you're pretty astonishing,
right?

454
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,139
No, sir.

455
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:57,107
-You do.
-I don't think
I'm astonishing.

456
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:59,410
-You think
you are astonishing.
-No, sir.

457
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:01,345
Yep, listen.

458
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:06,350
Everything that you've
accomplished,

459
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,788
you owe to me, right.
You know that.

460
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,226
Yes, sir.

461
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:19,430
Don't "yes, sir" me.
Allright, that pisses me off.

462
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:21,198
Don't do that.

463
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:29,440
I saw you smile at that game
on Saturday.

464
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:38,682
I don't think I was smiling.

465
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:40,818
Uh, I saw you.

466
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:44,555
In the photo,
in the newspaper.

467
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,757
You are standing
on the mound, smiling.

468
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:50,994
So, what happens
when you break a rule?

469
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:53,163
Hm? What's the rule
number one?

470
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,736
Never show emotion
on the mound.

471
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,337
Hm-mm.

472
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:04,908
And what do we do
when you break a rule
during a game?

473
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:07,811
What do we do?

474
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:10,814
What the fuck!

475
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,352
Huh? What do we do?

476
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:19,790
Huh? What do we do?

477
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:21,225
We run wind sprints.

478
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:23,393
That's right. Now get
your ass outside,
come on.

479
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:26,130
Please don't make me chase you.
Come on, go!

480
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:28,932
Go!

481
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:33,804
Come on,
man, this is a suicide,
not a jog.

482
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:36,140
Don't make me get up
and chase you.

483
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:37,875
Don't make me get up
and chase you!

484
00:29:37,877 --> 00:29:40,577
Do not make me get up
and chase you!

485
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:42,079
Go! Go!

486
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:44,448
Look, I'm old and I can
run faster than
you motherfucker?

487
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:47,351
Come on, now!

488
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:54,124
That's better.

489
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,660
What you boys
doing out here?

490
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:59,229
- Oh, nothing.
- -What's going on out here?

491
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:02,232
Get inside, don't disobey me.
It ain't worth it.

492
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,300
Hey, there.

493
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,202
-What's going on out here?
-Nothing.

494
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:10,574
Where's he going?

495
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:12,142
He didn't even say hello.

496
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,777
Well, boys got no manners,
what'd you expect?

497
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:15,012
- Shut the fuck up.

498
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:16,580
What were you doing
to him out here?

499
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,817
What were you doing
to him out here?

500
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:24,788
Junior and me
have rules.

501
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,690
And I was remembering
them to him.

502
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:28,258
Suicides?

503
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,562
The rules don't concern you,
Susan. It ain't your concern.

504
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:34,698
Okay.

505
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,167
Don't come back here
trying to make things
the way they were.

506
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,003
Me and hop have a certain
way of doing things now

507
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,972
and it doesn't include
suicides.

508
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:44,374
You've to get accustomed
to that, you hear me?

509
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:47,911
What? Come here.

510
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:50,581
Come here.

511
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:53,550
Hey, hey.

512
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:57,554
You know what?

513
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:00,724
We're doing dandy
without you.

514
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:04,494
So you can either get
with the docket or you
can get out.

515
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:08,131
Susan, you're starting to sound
a lot like my warden, hal

516
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:10,968
and even a little bit
more like my parole officer,
Neal.

517
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,804
You all right?
Come here.

518
00:31:13,806 --> 00:31:19,076
You have any love
for your daddy?

519
00:31:19,078 --> 00:31:21,912
You're gonna have to earn
it this time, daddy.

520
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:24,848
All right, Susan.

521
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,217
I'm still your
fucking husband, right?

522
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,987
I have been getting
a lot of the bullshit
whiny card,

523
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:32,489
none of the soft stuff.

524
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:35,225
Whole
fucking world getting
topsy turvy.

525
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:37,561
Shit.

526
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:45,068
Hm-mm.

527
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,572
Time, the great destroyer.

528
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:24,942
Hey.

529
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,346
You want to be the best?

530
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:33,984
Huh?

531
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:36,386
What time is it?

532
00:32:37,056 --> 00:32:38,956
Do you want to be the best?

533
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:41,158
-Yeah, sure.
-All right then.

534
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:43,226
The time is now.

535
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:45,228
Get up.

536
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:48,799
Yeah,
what time is it, seriously?

537
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:50,968
It's 3:30 am,
it's time to jog.

538
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,370
-I've school in three hours.
-Wake up, dude.

539
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:56,406
I'm not gonna ask you again.

540
00:32:56,408 --> 00:33:00,077
Okay? I'm tryin' to teach you
about greatness.

541
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:03,080
I know you're pissed
at me, all right.

542
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:04,815
But let me tell you
something right now.

543
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:06,516
We are winning.

544
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:08,018
You hear me?

545
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:12,155
Only me, you and the ghosts
of the legends up at this hour.

546
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,292
One of these days,
you're going to be rich.

547
00:33:15,294 --> 00:33:18,528
You are going to be
in some fancy hotel.

548
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,331
Two Egyptian princesses
are going to be fighting over

549
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,467
which one will get
to suck your cock first.

550
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:25,836
You're gonna lean back,
you're gonna look
at the ceiling and think,

551
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:28,538
"goddamn,
i love my dad."

552
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,607
Huh? You hear me, son.

553
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:32,776
You're gonna put your head
on the pillow,

554
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:36,279
close your eyes,
your dreams will line
up just right.

555
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:39,249
I shit you not, son,
we are winning right now.

556
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:04,408
All right,
that's good.
That's good.

557
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:07,544
Take off your gear
and go catch
some grounders.

558
00:34:13,852 --> 00:34:15,719
Something bothering you, hopper?

559
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:16,787
Just tired, coach.

560
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:24,461
What happened to your head?

561
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:28,231
Ah, it's nothing, coach.

562
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:16,379
<i>So where is hopper Gibson now?</i>

563
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:19,416
<i> He is not with the triple-a</i>
<i> minor league club</i>

564
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:22,052
<i> as he had been</i>
<i> for the most of the season.</i>

565
00:35:22,054 --> 00:35:24,087
<i>He is not on the injured list.</i>

566
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:26,923
<i> When I asked Atlanta's</i>
<i> gm, David foreman,</i>
<i> where Gibson was,</i>

567
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:31,094
<i> foreman would only say</i>
<i> that Gibson was taking care</i>
<i> of a personal situation</i>

568
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:33,330
<i> and would rejoin</i>
<i> the club shortly.</i>

569
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:35,599
<i> Thank you, Rachel.</i>

570
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:37,901
<i> Who knows what darkness</i>
<i> lurks in the heart of a man.</i>
<i> His shadow knows.</i>

571
00:35:37,903 --> 00:35:41,004
<i> Here's how hopper Gibson's</i>
<i> stats compare</i>
<i> with Howard glass.</i>

572
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:43,373
<i> Their numbers</i>
<i> are eerily similar.</i>

573
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:49,813
When you first
came into the public eye,

574
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:51,715
uh...

575
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:56,820
Why did you say
your father's a fisherman
to<i> sports illustrated?</i>

576
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,590
Because it's none
of their business.

577
00:36:07,466 --> 00:36:09,266
I mean what am I supposed
to do?

578
00:36:09,268 --> 00:36:12,569
Am I supposed to air
my dirty laundry in front
of the entire world?

579
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:15,105
Why would I do that
to my mom?

580
00:36:15,107 --> 00:36:16,606
You know? I mean,

581
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:21,611
am I suppose to say
he deals eight balls
in si?

582
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:22,846
Oh, huh.

583
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:27,450
Still you made up
occupations for your dad.

584
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:28,718
No, I didn't.

585
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:30,620
-No?
-No.

586
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:34,791
Every, he, yeah,
he hung drywall
for a while.

587
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:37,060
He was a fisherman.
He was a fisherman
for a year.

588
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:39,396
-Yeah, okay.
-Yeah.

589
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,401
Well, maybe that's how
you like to think of him.

590
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:48,772
I have no idea.

591
00:36:50,976 --> 00:36:54,811
All I know I'm fucking tired.
That's what I know.

592
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:06,790
Nice rain.

593
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,228
Clean my car off,
at least that's good.

594
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,735
-You think I'm lying,
don't you?
-No.

595
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:25,575
We can make the things
be the way we want them
to be in our head

596
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:28,578
so the pain
isn't too much.

597
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:32,749
And that's very different
from lying.

598
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:35,685
That's very different.

599
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:38,455
My dad always said,
"pain is weakness
leaving the body."

600
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,259
What do you think
of that?

601
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:45,695
I don't know.
What do you think?

602
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:52,135
It has it's own warped,
macho truth to it.

603
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:55,905
My dad was a pretty warped,
macho guy.

604
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:59,342
Wouldn't even know
we were in the same family
except...

605
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,946
Except for what?

606
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:10,320
People say that, I mean,
some people say that
i favor him.

607
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:13,790
We have the same look
in our eye.

608
00:38:16,395 --> 00:38:18,061
What look is that?

609
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:20,263
Secretive-ness, I guess.

610
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:25,302
Maybe something's going on,
maybe there's a time-bomb
ticking.

611
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,572
I picture my dad and,

612
00:38:32,678 --> 00:38:34,477
all I see is a shadow.

613
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:44,654
A person can reject
aspects of themselves
that they don't like

614
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,857
and put that
on to somebody else.

615
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:50,927
You know, project them.

616
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:57,967
Things that make them
uncomfortable or things
that feel dangerous,

617
00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:59,502
things that feel

618
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,073
ugly.

619
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:08,111
But the funny thing is,

620
00:39:08,113 --> 00:39:12,449
there's a lot of positive
things in our shadow
that we need.

621
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:14,617
- Like what?

622
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:21,991
Like our instincts,
for one.

623
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:24,961
Like our animal instincts.

624
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:26,629
So you want me
to get angry?

625
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:31,701
You want me to explode?

626
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:36,005
No, I want you to throw
without thinking about it.

627
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:39,409
I want you to be
instinctual. I want you
to get out of your way.

628
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:42,078
Leave yourself alone.
Do you want to explode?

629
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,555
No.

630
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,625
You feel like a time-bomb
sometimes?

631
00:39:57,496 --> 00:40:00,063
No. Of course, not.

632
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Okay. That's good.
I believe that.

633
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,773
Or I guess I was one.

634
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,743
And I didn't even know it.

635
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,826
Open up!

636
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:32,695
Hopper.

637
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:34,631
Teresa, you're looking spry.

638
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,467
-Bitch.
-Stop it.

639
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:39,436
I don't see Dorothy anywhere.

640
00:40:42,574 --> 00:40:45,608
-Does hop look upset to you?
-No, he doesn't look upset.

641
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,211
I wonder if they broke up.
Shit, I hope not.

642
00:40:48,213 --> 00:40:52,048
Coach Eddie better not even
think about taking him
out of the game.

643
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:55,418
-He looks tired.
-He doesn't look tired,
all right?

644
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,220
He looks lazy like his mother.

645
00:40:57,222 --> 00:40:59,622
Come on, hopper,
challenge this guy.

646
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:02,225
Huh, don't pussy foot around.
Challenge him!

647
00:41:02,227 --> 00:41:05,295
Coach Eddie,
better not make you
pussy foot these scrubs.

648
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:06,996
This kid can't hit you!

649
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:13,269
There you go, there you go.

650
00:41:53,812 --> 00:41:56,479
Christ, big shot, huh?

651
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:58,948
I guess you are really
that important, huh?

652
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:01,251
Easy.
I'm just here right now.

653
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:04,621
You have a good night,
huh, buddy.

654
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:46,062
You all right?

655
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,130
Yeah, I'm good.

656
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:49,732
-Arm's fine?
-Yeah.

657
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:54,170
Just worry about that hitter
right now. That's it.

658
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:55,238
Yes, coach.

659
00:42:58,376 --> 00:42:59,642
Where's your mind?

660
00:43:00,512 --> 00:43:02,078
It's in the game.

661
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,181
Nothing else should be
of any concern
to you right now.

662
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:07,750
You got to fuck
all that noise.

663
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:11,087
We'll deal with whatever
that is after the game.

664
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:14,691
You can't worry about that stuff
'cause you can't control it.

665
00:43:14,693 --> 00:43:16,693
So, there's no point
worrying about it.

666
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:19,362
This is it.

667
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:21,264
The only result is simple.

668
00:43:35,547 --> 00:43:37,046
This is it.

669
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:39,882
You ever heard
of f. Scott Fitzgerald?

670
00:43:41,086 --> 00:43:42,585
No.

671
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:47,223
Well, he was a<i> wunderkind,</i>
like yourself. A whiz kid.

672
00:43:47,225 --> 00:43:51,661
So good at his craft,
he didn't even have to think
about what he was doing.

673
00:43:51,663 --> 00:43:55,565
Now, this is about
Fitzgerald, uh...

674
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:57,066
-Cracking up.
-Hm.

675
00:43:57,068 --> 00:43:59,235
-You're cool
if I read a passage?
-Sure.

676
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,037
Short one?

677
00:44:01,506 --> 00:44:03,239
Okay, uh

678
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,308
"i was him again,

679
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:07,810
for an instant

680
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,346
I had the good fortune
to share his dreams,

681
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:12,649
I who have no more
dreams of my own.

682
00:44:13,785 --> 00:44:16,953
And there are still times
when I creep up on him,

683
00:44:16,955 --> 00:44:19,956
surprise him
on an Autumn morning
in New York

684
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:22,025
or a spring night
in Carolina

685
00:44:22,027 --> 00:44:25,895
when it's so quiet
you can hear a dog
barking in the next county.

686
00:44:27,432 --> 00:44:31,934
But never again, as during
that all too short period,

687
00:44:31,936 --> 00:44:34,404
when he and I were one person,

688
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,608
when the fulfilled future
and the wistful past

689
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:41,377
were mingled in a single
gorgeous moment,

690
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:46,849
when life was literally
a dream."

691
00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:53,956
-He's talking about
being old.
-Hm.

692
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:55,725
Wishing he was young again?

693
00:44:56,795 --> 00:44:58,861
I don't know anything
about that?

694
00:45:00,832 --> 00:45:03,533
Well, he wasn't that old
when he wrote it.

695
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:05,501
He was still
a pretty young man.

696
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:09,505
He felt old, he felt
like he wasn't connected
to his younger self any more.

697
00:45:09,507 --> 00:45:11,741
That's the rub.

698
00:45:11,743 --> 00:45:16,479
Probably he's talking about
life being a dream,
I've never experienced that.

699
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:18,314
-But...
-Never.

700
00:45:18,316 --> 00:45:21,884
Never once, felt any kind
of pleasure, any enjoyment
in your success?

701
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:25,788
No, never. No. My dad
always told me, "no
emotions on the mound."

702
00:45:26,825 --> 00:45:30,326
-So you can't show
emotions on the mound.
-No.

703
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:34,664
Were you allowed to show
emotion off the mound?

704
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:36,065
I was never off the mound.

705
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:38,000
I was taught,
you are always
on the mound.

706
00:45:38,002 --> 00:45:39,368
-Right.
-Always on the mound.

707
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,671
You are always
suppose to outfox
your opponent.

708
00:45:41,673 --> 00:45:43,539
-Yeah?
-Your opponent.

709
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:45,174
Your opponent, yeah.

710
00:45:45,176 --> 00:45:47,744
-Whose the opponent
off the mound?
-Everyone.

711
00:45:48,713 --> 00:45:51,447
Everyone outside
of the family.

712
00:45:53,885 --> 00:45:55,118
Yeah.

713
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,420
Must be pretty hard
to talk to me then.

714
00:45:57,422 --> 00:45:58,788
--No, seriously.

715
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:01,190
Well, sometimes, yeah.
I guess.

716
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:03,025
-Yeah. Well...
-Sure.

717
00:46:03,027 --> 00:46:05,294
-It's been
a difficult challenge.
-Yeah.

718
00:46:05,296 --> 00:46:07,196
Well.

719
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:12,568
Do you think your father
had a lot to do

720
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:15,438
with your success
as a pitcher, hopper?

721
00:46:20,078 --> 00:46:23,279
Hm. I mean, yeah.

722
00:46:24,048 --> 00:46:25,481
You know
when I was a little kid,

723
00:46:25,483 --> 00:46:27,550
I never thought
i was gonna make it
to the majors.

724
00:46:27,552 --> 00:46:30,920
I'd wanna go hang out
with friends,
go to the beach, you know.

725
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:33,556
But he, he would say,
"no, that's not gonna work.

726
00:46:33,558 --> 00:46:36,225
If you love it,
good things will come."

727
00:46:37,629 --> 00:46:39,395
-So what did you do?
-I loved it.

728
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:41,264
- Just like that?
- -Just like that.

729
00:46:41,266 --> 00:46:43,299
-Really?
-Yeah. Yeah.

730
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:48,771
<i> With three relief pitchers</i>
<i> on the dl,</i>

731
00:46:48,773 --> 00:46:53,142
<i>Atlanta looks to be in trouble,</i>
<i>heading into division playoffs</i>
<i>this coming weekend.</i>

732
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:55,778
<i> One name that has come up</i>
<i> as a possible remedy</i>

733
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:59,148
<i> is the last wonder boy,</i>
<i> hopper Gibson.</i>

734
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,983
<i> Gibson has spent</i>
<i> the past few months</i>

735
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:03,352
<i> in the minors</i>
<i> trying to regain control</i>

736
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:05,288
<i> of his considerable stuff.</i>

737
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:08,925
<i> In the current vernacular,</i>
<i> the dude's got issues.</i>

738
00:47:30,648 --> 00:47:32,582
It's not that hard.
Come on.

739
00:47:52,837 --> 00:47:54,604
Uh, what do I miss
most about the majors?

740
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:57,406
Probably the jet planes.

741
00:47:57,408 --> 00:48:00,509
Can't jump a jet plane
with can of freight train,
right, hopper?

742
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,044
What about those geese, hopper?

743
00:48:03,314 --> 00:48:04,480
How do you mean?

744
00:48:04,482 --> 00:48:06,883
I mean, you've watched
them a long time.

745
00:48:09,654 --> 00:48:10,753
Yeah, I don't know.

746
00:48:10,755 --> 00:48:15,224
Watching the geese
was just so...Peaceful.

747
00:48:15,827 --> 00:48:18,194
I prefer watching jet planes.

748
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:20,830
Well, then you wanna follow
someone who is in the majors.

749
00:48:20,832 --> 00:48:22,698
What can I say?
I'm dedicated.

750
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,166
To car crashes, yeah.

751
00:48:24,168 --> 00:48:26,435
Don't talk about yourself
like that.

752
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:27,436
You give good quote.

753
00:48:27,438 --> 00:48:29,238
That shit about geese
is nice stuff.

754
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:31,607
I'm glad you think so.

755
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:33,242
You have enough
so you don't have to
tag-along in here?

756
00:48:34,045 --> 00:48:35,711
It's only a good quote today.

757
00:48:35,713 --> 00:48:37,680
Tomorrow they'll wrap
a fish in it.

758
00:48:37,682 --> 00:48:40,683
I'll have to come back
for more, fresh.

759
00:48:40,685 --> 00:48:42,885
Sorry, it's exhausting
for me too.

760
00:48:42,887 --> 00:48:45,187
Takes a lot of medicine
to keep up to this pace.

761
00:48:45,189 --> 00:48:47,056
I'm on the redbull, heavy.

762
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:49,191
After this, I have to go
on Twitter and think
of something

763
00:48:49,193 --> 00:48:53,796
charming/cutting/
provocative/sexy/
informative to tweet.

764
00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:55,865
And then condense it
into pithy anecdotal

765
00:48:55,867 --> 00:48:59,101
making sure not to go
over the heads
of feeble-minded frat boys.

766
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,938
It's a fairly
fucking relentless grind.

767
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,372
Yeah,
i noticed that.

768
00:49:06,644 --> 00:49:10,179
<i> Hm. I'm still</i>
<i> on school schedule, hop.</i>

769
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:13,382
<i> I don't know</i>
<i> who else to call, sorry.</i>

770
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:15,051
<i> Wait, wait, wait.</i>

771
00:49:15,053 --> 00:49:16,819
<i> Hold on. I've got</i>
<i> like no signal here.</i>

772
00:49:16,821 --> 00:49:18,988
<i> I'm gonna go out</i>
<i> on the porch, so</i>
<i> I can hear you better.</i>

773
00:49:20,058 --> 00:49:21,457
<i> All right, kiddo, go ahead.</i>

774
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:25,962
<i> I don't know.</i>
<i> Last week, you know.</i>

775
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:29,265
<i> I seem to be getting better.</i>

776
00:49:29,267 --> 00:49:31,067
<i> Tonight, I can't find</i>
<i> the plate.</i>

777
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:35,171
<i> I never know who's</i>
<i> gonna show up,</i>
<i> you know.</i>

778
00:49:35,173 --> 00:49:36,939
<i> Sometimes,</i>
<i> we're who we want to be,</i>

779
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:39,408
<i> sometimes we're just</i>
<i> some dunderhead chump.</i>

780
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:42,345
<i> That's the way it goes.</i>
<i> That's okay.</i>

781
00:49:42,347 --> 00:49:44,080
<i> Sometimes your cutter</i>
<i> is hitting,</i>

782
00:49:44,082 --> 00:49:45,481
<i> sometimes it's not.</i>

783
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:49,018
<i> But there's no need</i>
<i> to, like, elaborate on it,</i>

784
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,587
<i> and beat the shit</i>
<i> out of yourself at that time</i>
<i> at what you do.</i>

785
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:57,626
<i>You add this extra layer</i>
<i>of anguish by judging yourself</i>
<i>so harshly all thtime.</i>

786
00:49:57,628 --> 00:50:03,432
<i> Yeah.
I just wish</i> <i>I could forget about stuff</i> <i>when I'm out there, you know.</i>

787
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:05,368
<i> Forget about stuff</i>
<i> from yesterday.</i>

788
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:09,271
<i>Yesterday can't be done.</i>
<i>You can't just get rid of it.</i>

789
00:50:09,273 --> 00:50:13,275
<i> There's no way</i>
<i> to push it aside, or</i>
<i> dig a hole and bury it.</i>

790
00:50:13,277 --> 00:50:15,511
<i> -You know</i>
<i> what I'm saying, kid?</i>
<i> -Yeah.</i>

791
00:50:16,381 --> 00:50:18,381
<i> How's Dorothy?</i>

792
00:50:18,383 --> 00:50:20,282
<i> I don't know.</i>

793
00:50:20,284 --> 00:50:22,184
<i> I think she thinks</i>
<i> I'm shallow.</i>

794
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:24,353
<i> You got to be</i>
<i> Paul robeson with her.</i>

795
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,957
<i> She's done with it,</i>
<i> you know.</i>

796
00:50:27,959 --> 00:50:29,425
<i> Who's Paul robeson?</i>

797
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:33,162
<i> He's an all star</i>
<i> and got black listing.</i>

798
00:50:33,164 --> 00:50:36,032
<i>Like, fuck him right now.</i>

799
00:50:37,502 --> 00:50:40,636
<i> I'm sorry for calling you,</i>
<i> waking you up.</i>
<i> Go back to sleep.</i>

800
00:50:41,406 --> 00:50:42,471
<i> All right?</i>

801
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:52,648
Who should I make this
out to?

802
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:54,216
-Uh, fallon.
-Fallon.

803
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:56,852
How I spell fallon?
Does anyone have a pen?
Do you have a pen?

804
00:50:56,854 --> 00:50:58,487
Thank you.
What is it?

805
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:00,556
-F-a...
-F-a...

806
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:02,658
-L-l...
-L-l...

807
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,893
-O-n.
-O-n.

808
00:51:03,895 --> 00:51:05,161
Cool name.

809
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:07,163
There you go.

810
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:09,732
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

811
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:12,068
Sign the ball, please.

812
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,703
-Yeah? Sign it?
-Yeah.

813
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:16,072
-Please.
-All right.

814
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:24,780
Thanks. Could you
sign this card, too?

815
00:51:24,782 --> 00:51:26,215
Yeah.

816
00:51:26,217 --> 00:51:28,250
My dad says
you are going to be fine.

817
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:30,586
Here you go.

818
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:32,688
He says you're going
to get your control back
in no time at all.

819
00:51:34,358 --> 00:51:37,560
Um, could you show me
your curve-ball grip?

820
00:51:37,562 --> 00:51:39,061
Could you show me
a curve-ball grip?

821
00:51:39,063 --> 00:51:40,596
-Let's see your grip.
-All right, cool.

822
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:43,199
-So, two seams, two seams,
get it.
-Yeah, there you go.

823
00:51:43,201 --> 00:51:44,266
-All right.
-Something like that?

824
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:46,235
Yeah, all right,
that's good.

825
00:51:46,237 --> 00:51:49,572
But see the hardest thing
for me to figure out is,

826
00:51:49,574 --> 00:51:50,940
you got to snap this.

827
00:51:50,942 --> 00:51:52,441
-Snap it like that?
-Yeah.

828
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:55,211
There you go.
You can't throw it
like a fast ball.

829
00:51:55,213 --> 00:51:57,813
Hm-mm, so right around
like that?

830
00:51:57,815 --> 00:51:59,315
- So...
- -Dude!

831
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:02,985
Are you handing out
instructions now?

832
00:52:02,987 --> 00:52:05,621
- Better go.
-That is fucking scary.

833
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:06,689
Thanks, hopper.

834
00:52:09,393 --> 00:52:11,927
That's the good thing
about youngsters
though, right?

835
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:14,163
They are undiscriminating.

836
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,699
You know that word?

837
00:52:18,803 --> 00:52:21,770
Of course, you do.
I learned that word
in the pen.

838
00:52:21,772 --> 00:52:27,109
We had this, priest use
to come by Sunday nights,
you know.

839
00:52:27,111 --> 00:52:29,078
Have a little Bible study.

840
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:32,581
So I signed right up.
For giggles.

841
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:35,985
And he used to say that,
"Jesus was undiscriminating.

842
00:52:35,987 --> 00:52:37,953
He loved all of us.

843
00:52:37,955 --> 00:52:40,256
Each and everyone
of us just the same."

844
00:52:40,258 --> 00:52:41,524
You believe that?

845
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:45,261
- Hm.
- -So?

846
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:47,263
-How's the arm?
-It's fine.

847
00:52:47,265 --> 00:52:48,964
-As fine?
-Yeah.

848
00:52:48,966 --> 00:52:51,433
-All right.
-What you are doing here?

849
00:52:51,435 --> 00:52:54,403
What do you mean
what am I doing here?
Come on.

850
00:52:55,206 --> 00:52:56,672
I came to say hi.

851
00:52:57,441 --> 00:52:59,375
Well, I'm not pitching today,
so...

852
00:52:59,377 --> 00:53:02,211
I know, I know.
I'm relieved.

853
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:04,113
You wanna go
get some peanuts?

854
00:53:04,115 --> 00:53:06,448
Come on, let's get
some peanuts.

855
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:08,450
What are you
doing in California?

856
00:53:08,452 --> 00:53:10,052
I got a job,
buddy of mine...

857
00:53:10,054 --> 00:53:12,254
Okeechobee, hooked me
up with a...

858
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:15,624
A little deal in Mexico,
at the border.

859
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:18,127
Job, good one.

860
00:53:18,129 --> 00:53:19,895
What kind of job
is that?

861
00:53:19,897 --> 00:53:21,197
The best kind.

862
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:23,465
The kind that might be
my last.

863
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:26,168
You know, set me up
for early retirement,
like your mom.

864
00:53:29,807 --> 00:53:31,373
I saw the house
you bought her.

865
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:34,910
Lot of carpenters there.

866
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:38,380
Hittin' it.

867
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:43,519
Well, I guess the priest
didn't reform you,
did he?

868
00:53:43,521 --> 00:53:45,054
No, sir.

869
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:46,488
They don't make 'em
like me anymore,

870
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:48,424
they try
to bring me down.

871
00:53:48,426 --> 00:53:51,860
Well, see with me,
it's a matter
of self respect.

872
00:53:51,862 --> 00:53:56,031
-Yeah, I got to go
do some running.
-No, you don't.

873
00:53:56,033 --> 00:53:57,666
No, you don't.
Come on, now.

874
00:53:57,668 --> 00:54:00,002
I hear you got knocked around
a little bit the other night.

875
00:54:00,004 --> 00:54:01,770
-Yeah.
-You know why?

876
00:54:01,772 --> 00:54:03,239
-Yeah, I know why.
-Why?

877
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:05,441
-My footing's off.
-Yeah.

878
00:54:05,443 --> 00:54:07,743
I've got professional coaches
to help me with that now.

879
00:54:08,512 --> 00:54:10,179
-Oh, you do?
-Yeah, I do.

880
00:54:10,181 --> 00:54:11,780
Okay. Okay.

881
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,250
They helping you
with your face?

882
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:16,919
-My face?
-Hm-mm.

883
00:54:18,022 --> 00:54:19,622
Your intimidation stare.

884
00:54:20,558 --> 00:54:22,725
Do you remember anything
that I taught you?

885
00:54:22,727 --> 00:54:25,361
Huh? Bob Gibson?

886
00:54:26,197 --> 00:54:27,763
Dave Stewart.

887
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:28,831
"The rocket" clemens.

888
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,866
Ferocious?

889
00:54:30,868 --> 00:54:33,402
Bitchin' motherfuckers
would have you out

890
00:54:33,404 --> 00:54:35,304
before you stepped
in the batter's box

891
00:54:35,306 --> 00:54:37,439
with their fucking eyes.

892
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,708
Okay? And look at you,
you're not even
a paper tiger.

893
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:43,379
You wander over to the mound
with your tail between your legs
like a little puppy.

894
00:54:43,381 --> 00:54:44,947
I was worried
you were gonna piss yourself.

895
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,452
I'll work on my rocket.

896
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:54,456
Get some hgh
and some steroids
while I'm at it.

897
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:56,125
Hey, look,
you are joking?

898
00:54:56,127 --> 00:54:58,060
Right? But...

899
00:54:58,062 --> 00:55:00,829
Five, ten years from now,
all that shit's gonna be legal.

900
00:55:00,831 --> 00:55:03,499
You know that, right?
The government can't stop
evolution.

901
00:55:03,501 --> 00:55:05,567
All drugs should be legal.

902
00:55:05,569 --> 00:55:07,236
-Then you'd be out of a job.
-Hm-mm.

903
00:55:07,238 --> 00:55:10,839
I'd still have you as my
full time fucking employment,
hm?

904
00:55:10,841 --> 00:55:14,977
When I delivered you,
you were a perfectly sound
pitcher.

905
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:19,682
Two years with these
so called experts, and what?
You are all banged up.

906
00:55:19,684 --> 00:55:22,418
You are all, you are all
tangled up.

907
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:25,054
It's not their fault, dad.

908
00:55:27,258 --> 00:55:29,124
So you say.

909
00:55:29,126 --> 00:55:32,294
-They got a weight room here
in the minors leagues, skinny?
-All right.

910
00:55:32,296 --> 00:55:34,029
-I got to go.
-No, no, listen.

911
00:55:34,031 --> 00:55:36,598
-I'm serious
about the anbolics.
-Yeah. I will.

912
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,336
-I can get you
the undetectable stuff.
-All right.

913
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:32,087
Get in.

914
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:38,594
You got to get wet
all at once, then it's
awfully pleasant.

915
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:42,131
If it's so pleasant,
why aren't you getting in?

916
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,600
Truckers.

917
00:56:44,602 --> 00:56:47,202
I was on my feet all day
waiting on suckers.

918
00:56:47,204 --> 00:56:48,737
That makes me a sucker,
too, huh?

919
00:56:50,207 --> 00:56:51,907
I work at Millie's
a mile away.

920
00:56:54,211 --> 00:56:56,111
Do you see bunions
on my feet?

921
00:56:56,113 --> 00:56:58,347
No,
i don't see any bunions.

922
00:56:58,349 --> 00:57:00,149
Not from this distance,
anyway.

923
00:57:01,185 --> 00:57:02,918
You with the ball club,
hopper?

924
00:57:03,687 --> 00:57:04,920
That's right.

925
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,857
-What position?
-Pitcher.

926
00:57:09,393 --> 00:57:12,127
-Throw fast?
-Very.

927
00:57:12,129 --> 00:57:14,763
Oh, regular Bob feller.

928
00:57:15,533 --> 00:57:16,865
That might be.

929
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:23,772
My name's Candace,
by the way.

930
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:28,377
I'm a regular Candace.

931
00:57:28,379 --> 00:57:29,611
What's that mean?

932
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:31,747
Get it? Regular Bob feller,
regular Candace.

933
00:57:31,749 --> 00:57:32,848
Oh, I got you.

934
00:57:39,323 --> 00:57:40,956
So you're a waitress
around here?

935
00:57:42,393 --> 00:57:45,260
And you live
in the motel?

936
00:57:45,262 --> 00:57:49,832
For the night, at any rate.
My old man's a fucking child.

937
00:57:50,734 --> 00:57:53,802
He ran out of generosity,
even for himself.

938
00:57:54,305 --> 00:57:55,604
Hm.

939
00:57:55,606 --> 00:57:57,639
He tells me he lifted me
out of the gutter,

940
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:59,541
but I'm pretty sure
I'm still there.

941
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:03,846
Maybe you know how
it can be with drunks.

942
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:09,985
Do I have something
on my mouth or something?

943
00:58:11,255 --> 00:58:13,222
You keep staring
at my mouth.

944
00:58:17,495 --> 00:58:19,495
Okay, it's okay.

945
00:58:19,497 --> 00:58:23,232
Here. Watch it
blow you a kiss.

946
00:58:35,546 --> 00:58:37,179
You seem
ill at ease, homeboy.

947
00:58:37,982 --> 00:58:39,248
Yeah... if I

948
00:58:40,551 --> 00:58:42,518
get caught by the coaches
I'm dead.

949
00:58:43,621 --> 00:58:45,220
You'll die satisfied.

950
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:48,690
Hey, come here.

951
00:58:52,563 --> 00:58:53,862
You're a stud.

952
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,726
Goddang.

953
00:59:25,362 --> 00:59:26,628
Ah.

954
00:59:27,331 --> 00:59:29,231
I could kiss you forever.

955
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:33,635
You expecting someone?

956
00:59:34,672 --> 00:59:36,338
As a matter of fact,
i am.

957
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,840
Don't be too sore
with me, okay?

958
00:59:38,842 --> 00:59:41,577
Whatever's got a tail
at one end, has teeth
at the other.

959
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:43,512
What the fuck
are you talking about?

960
00:59:43,514 --> 00:59:45,647
I claimed that
from the nature channel.

961
00:59:48,385 --> 00:59:50,185
- Door's not locked.

962
00:59:51,789 --> 00:59:54,189
It's okay,
it's okay.

963
00:59:54,191 --> 00:59:55,991
- It's okay.

964
00:59:57,728 --> 01:00:01,763
I'm just gonna,
I'm just gonna
take this, okay?

965
01:00:03,367 --> 01:00:04,766
And this.

966
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:11,807
-Do whatever you want.
-Those are real nice.

967
01:00:12,643 --> 01:00:14,309
Oh, you need
a watch right, baby.

968
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,113
Earrings.

969
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:21,316
Don't you worry.

970
01:00:23,721 --> 01:00:25,354
Turn over and
lie on your stomach.

971
01:00:28,325 --> 01:00:30,926
My ride's downstairs
in the form of a motorcycle.

972
01:00:30,928 --> 01:00:33,629
I'm going to take
your party favors
and start the engine.

973
01:00:33,631 --> 01:00:36,665
My pal sees you move,
or hears you breathe,

974
01:00:36,667 --> 01:00:38,734
he's gonna blast you
in the back of your head.

975
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,637
So, don't move
or breathe, hopper.

976
01:00:51,649 --> 01:00:54,383
- Are you breathing?
-No.

977
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:58,654
Well, you can breathe
a little.

978
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:04,326
Oh, man, sometimes
I'm just plain mean and salty.

979
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:31,847
Son of a bitch.

980
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:51,399
I'm sorry that
you're in distress

981
01:02:51,401 --> 01:02:55,904
but, that doesn't change
the way things went down.

982
01:02:55,906 --> 01:02:57,205
-You know.
-Yeah.

983
01:02:58,609 --> 01:03:00,475
I thought I was your
best friend,

984
01:03:00,477 --> 01:03:04,045
and, all of a sudden,
you treated me
like a stalker.

985
01:03:04,047 --> 01:03:05,881
I felt bad for even
calling you.

986
01:03:05,883 --> 01:03:08,650
You don't know
what it's like.

987
01:03:08,652 --> 01:03:11,920
To be what,
like illusturious
you mean?

988
01:03:11,922 --> 01:03:14,556
Are you still
on that trip?

989
01:03:14,558 --> 01:03:16,091
No, I'm not.

990
01:03:16,093 --> 01:03:19,161
-Still trying to be the dude
from the wheaties box?
-No.

991
01:03:20,631 --> 01:03:25,734
The sooner you realize
that we are all just utterly
unique aliens

992
01:03:25,736 --> 01:03:27,803
in this vast universe,

993
01:03:28,939 --> 01:03:33,608
and stop trying to be
some commercial, conditioned,

994
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:36,578
brain-washed, TV cowboy
version of yourself.

995
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:38,580
-Yeah, I know. I know.
-The less you're gonna suffer.

996
01:03:38,582 --> 01:03:40,916
I know and that's not...
I was...

997
01:03:43,253 --> 01:03:44,386
I was confused.

998
01:03:45,355 --> 01:03:46,955
I'm sorry.

999
01:03:46,957 --> 01:03:49,524
I can't. I don't know
what else to say.

1000
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:52,627
I go back to new haven soon.

1001
01:03:52,629 --> 01:03:54,262
I don't know
what else I can do.

1002
01:03:54,264 --> 01:03:56,231
Do you have another
boyfriend waiting for you?

1003
01:03:59,102 --> 01:04:00,168
No.

1004
01:04:00,771 --> 01:04:03,171
But I have papers and,

1005
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:06,007
teachers...

1006
01:04:08,111 --> 01:04:11,880
I can't be here for you
like that anymore.

1007
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:16,351
You're scared
and you need somebody,
maybe anybody.

1008
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:18,453
That's not what it's like.
Okay?

1009
01:04:18,455 --> 01:04:20,889
That's not what
it's like. I promise.

1010
01:04:20,891 --> 01:04:23,358
Then what is it like,
"talk to me."

1011
01:04:24,728 --> 01:04:26,094
It's not fair.

1012
01:04:27,831 --> 01:04:31,366
I'm not good at talking
about stuff.

1013
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:35,070
Well, I want to talk.

1014
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:40,308
I'm in love with you, hopper.

1015
01:04:40,644 --> 01:04:41,910
Like a lot.

1016
01:04:42,813 --> 01:04:44,145
You know.

1017
01:04:45,649 --> 01:04:48,216
So, when you do
want to talk,

1018
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:51,052
let me know.

1019
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:05,867
Okay. Now I want you
to throw one right over
the plate, strike.

1020
01:05:05,869 --> 01:05:07,769
Okay? Show me
what you've got.

1021
01:05:07,771 --> 01:05:10,071
What do you want?
Cheese, Charlie?

1022
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:11,907
-Change up?
-Whatever you want.

1023
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:14,075
-Anything?
-Just throw me
a strike.

1024
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:15,343
--All right?

1025
01:05:26,356 --> 01:05:28,223
All right.

1026
01:05:28,225 --> 01:05:30,525
What's the most fun
you ever had playing
baseball?

1027
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:33,128
-Fun?
-Hm-mm.

1028
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:35,263
Now, come on,
there must have been
one time. Come on.

1029
01:05:36,867 --> 01:05:38,600
Yeah, I guess
there was one time.

1030
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:41,736
When I was five or six,
we used to play in this
abandoned parking lot.

1031
01:05:41,738 --> 01:05:44,439
-Did you pitch?
-Yeah, that's the first time
i pitched.

1032
01:05:45,075 --> 01:05:47,242
-And that was fun?
-Yeah.

1033
01:05:47,244 --> 01:05:49,277
What was so fun
about pitching then?

1034
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:53,114
I don't know. We were just
stupid kids. Nobody expected
anything out of us, you know.

1035
01:05:54,718 --> 01:05:58,486
How do you think
you can get pitching
to feel that way again?

1036
01:05:58,488 --> 01:06:01,957
I don't know.
That's the big question.

1037
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:06,328
You add millions of dollars
to it and something changes,
i guess.

1038
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:08,396
Probably have to do
hypnosis to make me think

1039
01:06:08,398 --> 01:06:10,999
I'm in an abandoned
parking lot or something.

1040
01:06:11,935 --> 01:06:14,636
Close your eyes.

1041
01:06:15,906 --> 01:06:18,473
-I wasn't serious.
-I am. Now close your eyes.

1042
01:06:19,943 --> 01:06:22,644
- Huh.
-No laughing,
come on, man.

1043
01:06:24,114 --> 01:06:29,017
See it, hear it,
feel it, smell it.

1044
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,553
- Smell it?
-Yeah.

1045
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:35,590
Yeah, you are five years old.

1046
01:06:36,126 --> 01:06:37,192
Uh...

1047
01:06:38,295 --> 01:06:40,662
Could be a warm day
like this one,

1048
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:42,230
if that's what you remember.

1049
01:06:45,936 --> 01:06:47,602
-Seriously?
-Can you see anything?

1050
01:06:47,604 --> 01:06:49,037
Can you see anything?

1051
01:06:53,977 --> 01:06:55,677
Yeah, I can see it, kinda.

1052
01:06:56,847 --> 01:06:58,179
And what you see?

1053
01:07:02,619 --> 01:07:03,685
I don't know.

1054
01:07:06,823 --> 01:07:08,089
I, uh...

1055
01:07:10,861 --> 01:07:13,194
You are, what,
five years old.

1056
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:18,433
Deep, deep breath.

1057
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:24,606
That's it. Take another
deep breath.

1058
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:30,378
Wind up and throw
whenever you want.

1059
01:07:31,515 --> 01:07:32,580
Go for it.

1060
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:52,067
- How'd that feel?

1061
01:07:53,003 --> 01:07:54,269
Felt good.

1062
01:07:55,338 --> 01:07:56,471
How did it look?

1063
01:07:58,442 --> 01:07:59,507
Perfect.

1064
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,100
-There he is!
-Hopper! Hopper!

1065
01:08:25,102 --> 01:08:27,202
Any comment on
your dad's arrest?

1066
01:08:27,204 --> 01:08:29,370
How do you feel
his criminal record
being exposed?

1067
01:08:29,372 --> 01:08:31,039
Come on, hopper.
It's me, talk to me.

1068
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:35,410
Ladies and gentlemen,
my client has no comment
at this time.

1069
01:08:35,412 --> 01:08:37,479
Give me exclusive,
I'll put sugar on it?

1070
01:08:38,115 --> 01:08:40,115
Oh, you filthy little girl.

1071
01:08:40,117 --> 01:08:43,418
We can't get the public
to be sympathetic to hopper
if they don't know him.

1072
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:47,622
Hey, where are jd salinger
and boo radley staying?
Go there.

1073
01:08:50,427 --> 01:08:51,493
Cunt.

1074
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:54,162
Go. Go.

1075
01:08:54,164 --> 01:08:56,231
You got to tell me
when the club puts
you in a shitty dump like this.

1076
01:08:56,233 --> 01:08:58,566
They didn't put me
in here, I asked to
be put in here.

1077
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:01,369
Huh.

1078
01:09:04,107 --> 01:09:06,841
--What's with the get-up?

1079
01:09:06,843 --> 01:09:11,713
Ah, fundraising benefit.
I figured I'd go
as the Duke of Earl.

1080
01:09:12,916 --> 01:09:14,149
Hm.

1081
01:09:17,921 --> 01:09:19,354
You look like hell, hopper.

1082
01:09:19,356 --> 01:09:21,856
You have mobley
prescribe you
some sleeping pills.

1083
01:09:23,927 --> 01:09:26,594
Well, mobley
doesn't like pills.

1084
01:09:26,596 --> 01:09:28,429
-He doesn't like pills, huh?
-No.

1085
01:09:28,431 --> 01:09:30,498
-You still like him, though?
-He's all right.

1086
01:09:33,703 --> 01:09:36,838
-Those fucking parasites.
-What did they get my dad on?

1087
01:09:38,141 --> 01:09:40,108
Drug smuggling.

1088
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:43,711
-It's pretty serious.
-So did we lose any
endorsements?

1089
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:47,782
No, you did not.

1090
01:09:47,784 --> 01:09:50,552
Under armour
has contacted me
they want to talk. It's cool.

1091
01:09:50,554 --> 01:09:53,688
You did not get
into trouble,
your father did.

1092
01:09:55,458 --> 01:09:58,359
Could you not worry
about the companies?
That's my job.

1093
01:09:59,062 --> 01:10:00,361
Yeah.

1094
01:10:01,965 --> 01:10:03,531
Okay. Sick.

1095
01:10:07,637 --> 01:10:09,204
Let's dry you off.

1096
01:10:09,206 --> 01:10:11,940
Okay? Let's not
catch a cold on top
of everything else.

1097
01:10:14,244 --> 01:10:16,477
I'm gonna stay with you
till things settle down.

1098
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:18,313
It's all right.
You don't need to do that.

1099
01:10:18,315 --> 01:10:19,814
-With all your other clients.
-Nonsense.

1100
01:10:25,155 --> 01:10:28,256
You wanted to stay here, huh?

1101
01:10:28,258 --> 01:10:31,259
We're stuck. We've got
the leeches outside.

1102
01:10:31,261 --> 01:10:34,963
All right. I'm gonna order us
dinner from the four seasons,
okay?

1103
01:10:41,504 --> 01:10:43,238
Pass me the salt, please.

1104
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:46,708
Thank you. So...

1105
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:48,243
Now that I've shown up,

1106
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:52,413
it's gonna deflect a lot
of negativity away from you.

1107
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:55,450
The press hates me
more than anyone.

1108
01:10:56,553 --> 01:10:58,386
When we have the families
come in,

1109
01:10:58,388 --> 01:11:00,054
when we are representing
the premium people,

1110
01:11:00,056 --> 01:11:03,858
the draft, you know, '
the parents, fathers
and mothers and players,

1111
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:06,928
and they look at me
and they thank me
for what I do,

1112
01:11:08,865 --> 01:11:10,932
I don't give a shit
what the press says.

1113
01:11:12,202 --> 01:11:14,902
I mean, we got to have
a thick skin in this game.

1114
01:11:14,904 --> 01:11:16,571
All of us do.

1115
01:11:16,573 --> 01:11:18,273
-Right?
-Right.

1116
01:11:23,546 --> 01:11:25,313
Big league team
is calling you up.

1117
01:11:27,217 --> 01:11:28,883
Go to la, couple of days.

1118
01:11:32,055 --> 01:11:34,055
My dad's in prison
in la.

1119
01:11:34,057 --> 01:11:36,291
I thought of that.
You don't have to think
about that.

1120
01:11:38,295 --> 01:11:40,461
You gotta try that
with butter. I won't tell.

1121
01:11:42,999 --> 01:11:47,302
So, where did they
find Dr. mobley?

1122
01:11:48,338 --> 01:11:50,004
Everyone in sports knows him.

1123
01:11:51,574 --> 01:11:53,608
He's got a good reputation?

1124
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:55,910
What do you think?
Yeah.

1125
01:11:55,912 --> 01:11:59,280
The guy's was on the cover
of<i> time</i> magazine when he
was, like, 22 years old.

1126
01:11:59,282 --> 01:12:00,548
He's brilliant.

1127
01:12:01,918 --> 01:12:03,418
What was he on the cover
of<i> time</i> magazine for?

1128
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:05,353
He was the first
mental skills coach

1129
01:12:05,355 --> 01:12:08,256
hired full time
by the big league club,
at like, 21.

1130
01:12:08,258 --> 01:12:11,826
He was a prodigy.
He was like the Bobby fischer
of sports psychology.

1131
01:12:13,296 --> 01:12:15,430
Who's Bobby fischer?

1132
01:12:15,432 --> 01:12:17,432
No one. No one you need
to think about.

1133
01:12:17,434 --> 01:12:19,267
That's a shitty example.

1134
01:12:19,269 --> 01:12:22,870
You ever been to any kind of
mental coach or psychologist
before, no?

1135
01:12:22,872 --> 01:12:24,572
- No.
-So...

1136
01:12:26,009 --> 01:12:27,975
When I got some money,

1137
01:12:27,977 --> 01:12:31,279
the first thing I did
was I got a shrink.
Right?

1138
01:12:31,281 --> 01:12:34,515
And I went every other day
for five years,

1139
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:37,051
and finally, the guy says
to me, "oh...

1140
01:12:37,053 --> 01:12:39,754
You want to kill
your father and fuck
your mother."

1141
01:12:40,957 --> 01:12:42,990
I said, "oh, thanks, tyreseus,

1142
01:12:42,992 --> 01:12:46,160
that's why people go to shrinks.
Can I have my quarter of
a million dollars back now?"

1143
01:12:46,162 --> 01:12:47,428
You know.

1144
01:12:48,198 --> 01:12:51,366
But, look, mobley,
he's the man.

1145
01:12:52,035 --> 01:12:53,301
He worked
with Howard glass

1146
01:12:53,303 --> 01:12:54,736
before people
even understood

1147
01:12:54,738 --> 01:12:56,671
that there's such a thing
as sports psychology.

1148
01:12:56,673 --> 01:12:58,706
He said he didn't work
with Howard glass.

1149
01:13:00,677 --> 01:13:01,876
-Really?
-Yeah.

1150
01:13:04,214 --> 01:13:05,646
I mean, you know
these fucking shrinks,

1151
01:13:05,648 --> 01:13:07,148
they say one thing
to their patients,

1152
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:08,549
another thing
to their non-patients,

1153
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:11,219
another whole thing
altogether to their wives.

1154
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:13,054
They work in strange
and mysterious ways.

1155
01:13:15,024 --> 01:13:18,726
I mean, you and me are friends.
We straight talk to each other,
but shrinks have...

1156
01:13:19,529 --> 01:13:21,662
Weird ways.
That's how they are.

1157
01:13:21,664 --> 01:13:24,766
Yeah. You sure he worked
with Howard glass?

1158
01:13:24,768 --> 01:13:26,567
-Yes.
-Yeah?

1159
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:29,203
When glass died,
mobley dedicated his practice

1160
01:13:29,205 --> 01:13:31,472
solely to athletes
who are suffering from

1161
01:13:33,109 --> 01:13:34,909
you know, from the yips.

1162
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:37,412
Well, he's the expert
in the field now. Perhaps,
you misheard him.

1163
01:13:37,414 --> 01:13:38,813
No, I didn't mishear him.

1164
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:41,616
Hop, I'm telling you,

1165
01:13:42,419 --> 01:13:43,918
mobley is the man.

1166
01:13:45,021 --> 01:13:46,788
I trust him.
Do you trust me?

1167
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:50,425
-Yeah.
-Then we are all good.

1168
01:13:51,461 --> 01:13:52,927
Eat your fancy dinner.

1169
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,100
When I threw
with my eyes closed,

1170
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:00,701
I wasn't throwing strikes.

1171
01:14:01,738 --> 01:14:03,805
Right? You were just
fucking with me?

1172
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:07,041
No, I'm not just
fucking with you.

1173
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,143
Those were strikes, man.

1174
01:14:13,249 --> 01:14:14,615
Well,

1175
01:14:16,085 --> 01:14:19,387
I guess I really won't know
for sure until it's too late.

1176
01:14:19,389 --> 01:14:23,391
Out there, humiliating
myself in front of the entire
universe again

1177
01:14:23,393 --> 01:14:24,859
okay. Well.

1178
01:14:26,663 --> 01:14:29,997
-What's up, man?
-You didn't tell me anything.

1179
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,834
About Howard glass.

1180
01:14:32,836 --> 01:14:36,070
When I brought him up,
you just glazed right over it.

1181
01:14:36,072 --> 01:14:38,906
Don't you think
i would wanna know
about that?

1182
01:14:38,908 --> 01:14:42,043
I didn't want you
to dwell on him.

1183
01:14:43,246 --> 01:14:45,480
In that moment, uh...

1184
01:14:47,116 --> 01:14:50,084
In that moment, I wanted
to keep the focus
of the sessions

1185
01:14:50,086 --> 01:14:51,285
squarely on you.

1186
01:14:51,287 --> 01:14:52,753
So, we don't keep
the focus on you?

1187
01:14:52,755 --> 01:14:54,589
-No.
-We stay away
from the focus on you.

1188
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:56,023
- Right?

1189
01:14:59,095 --> 01:15:02,830
Howard glass
was my patient, yes.
It's true.

1190
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:08,703
And his suicide
affected me greatly.

1191
01:15:09,606 --> 01:15:11,439
Altered the course
of my life.

1192
01:15:11,441 --> 01:15:13,207
It altered the course
of my practice.

1193
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,511
You're a great talker.

1194
01:15:18,147 --> 01:15:20,181
But you couldn't
talk him out...

1195
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:22,316
Of killing himself.

1196
01:15:22,318 --> 01:15:23,818
No, I couldn't, no.

1197
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:25,853
- Does that haunt you?

1198
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:31,726
There was a time
when I put the blame
on myself, yeah.

1199
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:35,530
But I was...

1200
01:15:37,233 --> 01:15:38,533
Young.

1201
01:15:39,469 --> 01:15:41,536
And I've learned things
since then.

1202
01:15:41,538 --> 01:15:45,406
Um, I know now
what I can and can't do.

1203
01:15:45,408 --> 01:15:49,810
I can only talk to you
and listen to you
and be here with you.

1204
01:15:49,812 --> 01:15:51,746
I can't go out
the door with you.

1205
01:15:52,482 --> 01:15:54,048
Or take the mound
for you.

1206
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:56,617
Or pitch for you,
only you can do that.

1207
01:15:58,154 --> 01:16:00,288
-So?
-Are you married?

1208
01:16:01,157 --> 01:16:02,590
I'm divorced.

1209
01:16:02,592 --> 01:16:04,525
Is there anything else
you want to know?

1210
01:16:04,527 --> 01:16:06,327
-She left you?
-Yeah.

1211
01:16:06,329 --> 01:16:07,662
-Why did she leave you?
-That's right.

1212
01:16:07,664 --> 01:16:09,130
-What?
-Why did she leave you?

1213
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:14,168
Um, I was never home.
I was always working.

1214
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:15,670
And even when I was at home.

1215
01:16:15,672 --> 01:16:19,240
Um, see, there's now
a little, kinda...

1216
01:16:21,778 --> 01:16:24,011
It's not exactly the truth,
is it?

1217
01:16:24,013 --> 01:16:27,181
I mean, I did a lot
of googling on you.

1218
01:16:27,183 --> 01:16:29,584
I read the web.
It's out there.

1219
01:16:30,853 --> 01:16:33,020
-I got the scoop on you, doc.
-Yeah.

1220
01:16:34,624 --> 01:16:37,191
All right, let's hear it then.

1221
01:16:37,193 --> 01:16:42,563
Your life,
i mean, you sound like
you have it all together,

1222
01:16:42,565 --> 01:16:45,366
but your life is pretty
fucking far from perfect.

1223
01:16:45,368 --> 01:16:48,903
I think both of us
have some issues
about being perfect, man.

1224
01:16:48,905 --> 01:16:51,172
After he died, you hit
the bottle pretty hard, right?

1225
01:16:56,312 --> 01:16:57,612
Yeah.

1226
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:01,248
Arrested for drunken
disorderly conduct.

1227
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:03,317
-Yeah.
-Holy fuckin' shit.

1228
01:17:03,319 --> 01:17:07,054
Doc, I mean, she probably
thought she was marrying
a superstar,

1229
01:17:07,056 --> 01:17:10,458
and you didn't live up
to those expectations.

1230
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:12,393
Sounds familiar.

1231
01:17:12,395 --> 01:17:15,062
--Yeah. Kinda fell short.

1232
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:18,065
Bye-bye magazine covers.

1233
01:17:19,902 --> 01:17:20,968
Yup.

1234
01:17:22,605 --> 01:17:25,840
That was the best part,
actually.

1235
01:17:25,842 --> 01:17:28,342
And I wasn't
all that comfortable
with the attention myself.

1236
01:17:29,746 --> 01:17:33,347
Well, try living under
a fucking microscope
today.

1237
01:17:33,349 --> 01:17:35,116
-Yeah.
-You know?

1238
01:17:35,118 --> 01:17:37,084
They will eat you alive.

1239
01:17:37,086 --> 01:17:39,186
They find the smallest
chink in your armor.

1240
01:17:41,024 --> 01:17:43,357
Take off the armor.

1241
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:45,326
-Take off the armor.
-Yes.

1242
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:48,329
That's easy for you to say,
because nobody gives a shit
about you anymore.

1243
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:53,167
A lot of people want an
arm that throws a 100 mile
an hour fast ball.

1244
01:17:54,437 --> 01:17:57,204
You know what?
They can have the arm.

1245
01:17:58,808 --> 01:18:00,841
They really can.
You want the arm?

1246
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:02,977
You can have it.
It's yours.

1247
01:18:02,979 --> 01:18:05,613
-No, thank you.
-Oh, come on.
You know you want it.

1248
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:09,717
Who doesn't want an arm
that can throw a fast ball?

1249
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:11,519
Oh, I'm sure.
I'm sure.

1250
01:18:11,521 --> 01:18:12,953
Are you sure
you don't want it?

1251
01:18:12,955 --> 01:18:15,022
-Oh, I'm sure I don't want it.
-Okay.

1252
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:17,725
-I promise you that.
-Then what do you want?

1253
01:18:17,727 --> 01:18:19,126
-What do I want?
-Yes.

1254
01:18:19,128 --> 01:18:21,262
-Fuck you, we're not
going there.
-No. Fuck you.

1255
01:18:21,698 --> 01:18:23,297
Fuck you, come on.

1256
01:18:23,299 --> 01:18:25,866
-Oh, fuck you, fuck you.
-Okay.

1257
01:18:27,003 --> 01:18:29,203
That feeling you had
when you were a kid,

1258
01:18:30,306 --> 01:18:32,440
playing in the parking lot
with your friends.

1259
01:18:35,478 --> 01:18:37,144
That's still available
to you.

1260
01:18:37,146 --> 01:18:39,814
That's still available
to you, that still exist.

1261
01:18:39,816 --> 01:18:41,749
I swear to god,
it does.

1262
01:18:43,753 --> 01:18:45,753
Now you may feel
kinda beat up and fucked up,

1263
01:18:45,755 --> 01:18:48,723
and you're siting
in the corner of some
washed-up asshole's office.

1264
01:18:48,725 --> 01:18:50,825
But I swear to you,

1265
01:18:50,827 --> 01:18:53,661
that feeling
of being and playing,

1266
01:18:53,663 --> 01:18:55,730
that still is available
to you.

1267
01:18:55,732 --> 01:18:57,131
You thew strikes.

1268
01:18:58,167 --> 01:19:00,134
I couldn't bullshit you
about that.

1269
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:02,236
You know it.

1270
01:19:04,173 --> 01:19:05,239
So, believe me.

1271
01:19:07,877 --> 01:19:10,444
And this overwhelming
suspicion you have of people,

1272
01:19:10,446 --> 01:19:12,913
is old, old, old fear...

1273
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:15,750
And you can let go of that now.
Let go of it now.

1274
01:19:20,389 --> 01:19:22,089
I compete out of fear.

1275
01:19:23,693 --> 01:19:25,760
How am I gonna compete
if I don't have fear?

1276
01:19:25,762 --> 01:19:27,528
You wanna compete?

1277
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:29,029
You just said
you wanted...

1278
01:19:29,031 --> 01:19:31,132
I doesn't matter what I want,
'cause I have a contract.

1279
01:19:31,134 --> 01:19:32,867
And you know what?
I'll tell you something.

1280
01:19:32,869 --> 01:19:34,835
They picked the fucking guy.

1281
01:19:36,072 --> 01:19:38,205
Because I'm just
an ordinary kid.

1282
01:19:42,545 --> 01:19:43,811
I'm just
an ordinary kid.

1283
01:19:45,381 --> 01:19:47,648
And maybe that's what
makes you the right kid.

1284
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:49,450
-Can I lie down
for a second?
-Yeah.

1285
01:20:42,839 --> 01:20:45,005
<i> So, you ready</i>
<i> for the big game, hm?</i>

1286
01:20:45,842 --> 01:20:48,008
<i> Got you coming</i>
<i> out of the pen, huh?</i>

1287
01:20:50,112 --> 01:20:52,313
<i> You're going</i>
<i> to save everybody?</i>

1288
01:20:52,315 --> 01:20:55,182
<i> I raised you to be a horse,</i>
<i> not to come out of the pen.</i>

1289
01:20:56,485 --> 01:20:57,551
<i> So, hero,</i>

1290
01:20:58,287 --> 01:20:59,353
<i> what you doing here?</i>

1291
01:21:01,057 --> 01:21:06,060
<i> Well, my mental coach</i>
<i> thought it would be</i>
<i> a good idea.</i>

1292
01:21:06,062 --> 01:21:08,128
<i> -Your what?</i>
<i> -My mental coach.</i>

1293
01:21:12,001 --> 01:21:14,001
<i> Whatever.</i>

1294
01:21:14,003 --> 01:21:17,304
<i> -What do you talk about</i>
<i> with him?</i>
<i> -I don't know. Whatever.</i>

1295
01:21:17,306 --> 01:21:19,406
<i> Whatever we want to,</i>
<i> I guess.</i>

1296
01:21:19,408 --> 01:21:20,975
<i> Really?</i>

1297
01:21:20,977 --> 01:21:24,245
<i> What's the,</i>
<i> what's the diagnosis?</i>

1298
01:21:24,247 --> 01:21:25,913
<i> Ah, it's complicated.</i>

1299
01:21:25,915 --> 01:21:28,048
<i>-Oh, I bet.</i>
<i>-Actually, it's pretty simple.</i>

1300
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:32,686
<i> But, I'd rather not</i>
<i> get into it.</i>

1301
01:21:32,688 --> 01:21:34,922
<i> Suit yourself.</i>

1302
01:21:34,924 --> 01:21:37,424
<i> We got a shit load</i>
<i> of shrinks around here.</i>

1303
01:21:37,426 --> 01:21:39,426
<i> I just never...</i>

1304
01:21:39,428 --> 01:21:43,264
<i> Feel like telling</i>
<i> my private life</i>
<i> to some total stranger.</i>

1305
01:21:43,266 --> 01:21:46,066
<i> You know frank bullet</i>
<i> never cried to a quack,</i>
<i> right?</i>

1306
01:21:47,336 --> 01:21:50,170
<i> -You know who that is?</i>
<i> -Frank bullet?</i>

1307
01:21:51,374 --> 01:21:53,107
<i> Yeah.</i>

1308
01:21:53,109 --> 01:21:55,442
<i> -He's from the...</i>
<i> -From the movie, "bullet."</i>

1309
01:21:55,444 --> 01:21:56,810
<i> -Bullet?</i>
<i> -Yeah.</i>

1310
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:00,214
<i> Anyway, he's a cop, right?</i>
<i> But he's not like some loud</i>
<i> ol' pigs like these fuckers.</i>

1311
01:22:00,216 --> 01:22:01,415
<i> Yeah.</i>

1312
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:02,349
<i> They are trying</i>
<i> to reform me.</i>

1313
01:22:02,919 --> 01:22:04,485
<i> Yeah, turn me int a...</i>

1314
01:22:05,521 --> 01:22:06,620
<i> Modern man.</i>

1315
01:22:08,524 --> 01:22:12,426
<i> Modern man to me,</i>
<i> looks an awful lot</i>
<i> like a modern sissy.</i>

1316
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:15,029
<i> So do you have any friends</i>
<i> in here this time?</i>

1317
01:22:15,898 --> 01:22:17,331
<i> All my friends are dead.</i>

1318
01:22:20,803 --> 01:22:24,305
<i> I had a dream about</i>
<i> your mom last night.</i>

1319
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:27,541
<i> She was the same age</i>
<i> as when we met.</i>

1320
01:22:27,543 --> 01:22:30,210
<i> You know, head cheerleader.</i>
<i> That's all she cared about.</i>

1321
01:22:30,212 --> 01:22:33,480
<i> You know, but she was,</i>
<i> she was super pretty.</i>

1322
01:22:33,482 --> 01:22:36,617
<i> She'd do those tumbles</i>
<i> into jumps, you know.</i>

1323
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:38,252
<i> Stellar shit.</i>

1324
01:22:38,254 --> 01:22:41,288
<i> She led her whole team</i>
<i> to this competition in, uh,</i>

1325
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:43,891
<i> Tokyo, Japan.</i>
<i> Did you know that?</i>

1326
01:22:43,893 --> 01:22:46,060
<i> -Your mom competed in Japan.</i>
<i> -No.</i>

1327
01:22:46,062 --> 01:22:47,895
<i> -You didn't know that?</i>
<i> -No, I didn't.</i>

1328
01:22:47,897 --> 01:22:49,930
<i> I mean, I knew</i>
<i> she was cheerleader</i>
<i> but, I didn't know...</i>

1329
01:22:49,932 --> 01:22:51,265
<i> -She was the captain, dude.</i>
<i> -Yeah.</i>

1330
01:22:51,267 --> 01:22:53,968
<i>-Yeah, regional four champion.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

1331
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:56,070
<i> -Yeah, she didn't</i>
<i> tell you that?</i>
<i> -No.</i>

1332
01:22:57,306 --> 01:23:01,308
<i> Well, she was never</i>
<i> the bragging type,</i>
<i> you know.</i>

1333
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:04,311
<i> I'll give her that.</i>

1334
01:23:06,248 --> 01:23:08,983
<i> High-school sweethearts.</i>
<i> Die-hard.</i>

1335
01:23:09,418 --> 01:23:11,251
<i> Kid, beware.</i>

1336
01:23:11,253 --> 01:23:13,020
<i> Well, you know what?</i>

1337
01:23:13,022 --> 01:23:16,023
<i> -I started to talk</i>
<i> to Dorothy last night.</i>
<i> -Yeah.</i>

1338
01:23:16,025 --> 01:23:18,292
<i> -Yeah, we talked</i>
<i> for five hours.</i>
<i> -Five hours?</i>

1339
01:23:18,294 --> 01:23:20,094
<i> -Five hours.</i>
<i> -You're chatty Cathy, huh?</i>

1340
01:23:20,096 --> 01:23:21,962
<i> -I guess so.</i>
<i> -You think you love her?</i>

1341
01:23:21,964 --> 01:23:23,797
<i> -I think so.</i>
<i> -Hm.</i>

1342
01:23:23,799 --> 01:23:26,200
<i>You knew how to do that, huh?</i>
<i>Love somebody.</i>

1343
01:23:26,202 --> 01:23:30,337
<i> I need someone. I think,</i>
<i> she doesn't like, she...</i>

1344
01:23:31,207 --> 01:23:33,774
<i> -I have to communicate.</i>
<i> -Yeah, right.</i>

1345
01:23:33,776 --> 01:23:35,275
<i> -Or she gets pissed.</i>
<i> -Yeah.</i>

1346
01:23:35,277 --> 01:23:37,778
<i> Yeah.</i>

1347
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:42,049
<i> So you don't even care,</i>
<i> huh? You just, you let her</i>
<i> wear the pants?</i>

1348
01:23:42,051 --> 01:23:45,219
<i> Yeah, sometimes.</i>
<i> I guess.</i>

1349
01:23:49,025 --> 01:23:51,392
<i> What are you doing here,</i>
<i> horse, hm?</i>

1350
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:55,295
<i> I mean,</i>

1351
01:23:58,167 --> 01:24:00,067
<i> I taught you everything</i>
<i> I know already.</i>

1352
01:24:00,069 --> 01:24:01,635
<i> You got my two cents.</i>

1353
01:24:04,407 --> 01:24:05,472
<i> But you knew that.</i>

1354
01:24:07,009 --> 01:24:08,442
<i> But here you are.</i>

1355
01:24:09,979 --> 01:24:11,645
<i> You just come</i>
<i> to see the old man, huh?</i>

1356
01:24:11,647 --> 01:24:13,547
<i> Your old man who's not</i>
<i> worth a damn.</i>

1357
01:24:16,485 --> 01:24:20,554
<i> I mean, the fact</i>
<i> that you would come</i>
<i> here to see me,</i>

1358
01:24:21,657 --> 01:24:22,723
<i> before your big...</i>

1359
01:24:24,493 --> 01:24:25,793
<i> It's a big game,</i>
<i> you know.</i>

1360
01:24:26,662 --> 01:24:27,728
<i> It is.</i>

1361
01:24:30,032 --> 01:24:32,232
<i> I mean...</i>

1362
01:24:33,702 --> 01:24:35,436
<i> Show me what you're made of,</i>
<i> why don't you?</i>
