00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:57,331
FARMINGTON MENTAL HOSPITAL

2
00:00:58,334 --> 00:01:01,828
FIVE HOURS LATER

3
00:02:19,442 --> 00:02:25,664
THE STEAM EXPERIMENT

4
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:28,145
You fucking bitch!
You're gonna die!

5
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:52,016
This is a nice hotel.

6
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:53,077
Yeah.

7
00:03:53,485 --> 00:03:57,129
Built in the 1900s by a
railroad tycoon for his wife.

8
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:00,496
She was a socialite, had
a lot of friends liked to entertain.

9
00:04:00,838 --> 00:04:02,034
Isn't that a fact?

10
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:06,030
Yeah... And she died
after World War II,

11
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,704
...and it was closed for many years,
then a corporation bought it.

12
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:12,103
Now it's being turned into luxury condos.

13
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,705
Luxury condos.

14
00:04:14,705 --> 00:04:16,386
So that's why it's empty, hah?

15
00:04:16,628 --> 00:04:17,220
Yeah.

16
00:04:17,622 --> 00:04:20,348
I'll tell you the truth Grant,
we are the last guests.

17
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:23,360
I bribed a management.
They're gonna start renovation on monday.

18
00:04:24,211 --> 00:04:26,373
I gotta tell you I'm impressed.

19
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:29,334
This is a class-ass act.

20
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,331
Nothing but the best,
for the Annabell Dating Service.

21
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,106
What's up man?

22
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:22,203
My name is James Pettis.
I'm here to see Walter Grubbs.

23
00:05:23,128 --> 00:05:25,051
Walter Grubbs... Let's see.

24
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:30,478
That's the editor in chief man.

25
00:05:30,713 --> 00:05:31,822
The editor in chief.

26
00:05:32,343 --> 00:05:33,342
Call him.

27
00:05:35,024 --> 00:05:35,922
What, now?

28
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,121
Now.

29
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:44,365
Well done you.

30
00:06:18,888 --> 00:06:20,146
- Grubbs?
- Sim.

31
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,693
Walter.

32
00:06:23,587 --> 00:06:24,621
Mr. Grubbs,

33
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,102
...your clock is five minutes fast.

34
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,666
What can I do for you Mr.?

35
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,116
Pettis, James Pettis. You can
help me save the world.

36
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,986
Ok, look pal, in two hours
I have a deadline, so...

37
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:47,016
Listen, I chose you Walter, because you are a man of integrity.

38
00:06:47,253 --> 00:06:49,505
I could have gone to the New York Times,
I could have gone to the Washington Post...

39
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:51,650
...but I chose, you.

40
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,380
- Can I make a suggestion?
- Sure.

41
00:06:53,585 --> 00:06:54,677
Can I make a suggestion here?

42
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:58,337
You wanna save the world?
Great. Write a letter.

43
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,688
Make it as juicy as you want,
and send it to my attention, ok?

44
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,586
I'll see if I can get you in a column or
in "Letters to the Editor" section on Saturday.

45
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:08,152
Remember? The pen is
mightier than the sword, ok?

46
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:11,783
Ok. And... Walter, I have
got a deadline too.

47
00:07:12,316 --> 00:07:14,971
And in about two hours,
people are going to die.

48
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:40,776
Hey, Jack.

49
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:42,711
What's going on Bobo?

50
00:07:42,925 --> 00:07:44,280
Who is the lucky go tonight?

51
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:48,105
Show me a little respect.
You know I got ties older than you?

52
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,780
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

53
00:07:49,994 --> 00:07:50,881
Ties older than me?

54
00:07:52,787 --> 00:07:55,491
I guess I'll have to call my grandmother.
Maybe she is up for a date.

55
00:07:55,717 --> 00:07:58,092
If your grandmother still looks like you,
she wouldn't want you to do that.

56
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,268
Think it's easy to be me,
isn't it?

57
00:08:12,084 --> 00:08:13,490
What do you think of that, Walter?

58
00:08:17,532 --> 00:08:19,270
Well now, that is quite a story.

59
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:25,723
All right.

60
00:08:28,276 --> 00:08:30,619
I'm gonna call the press room,
I'm gonna tell them to hold the presses.

61
00:08:30,925 --> 00:08:32,359
You think you can make the deadline?

62
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:34,966
Oh yeah, story like this, absolutely.

63
00:08:36,986 --> 00:08:38,890
Thank god you didn't call The Times.

64
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,255
Butchers...

65
00:08:40,482 --> 00:08:41,737
That's putting it kindly.

66
00:08:46,157 --> 00:08:48,138
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.
You want a cup of coffee?

67
00:08:49,457 --> 00:08:51,430
You look tired, let me
get you a cup of coffee.

68
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:53,343
How do you take it?
Cream, sugar?

69
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,012
Surprise me.

70
00:08:59,402 --> 00:09:00,054
Ok.

71
00:09:12,557 --> 00:09:13,775
Yeah, Mancini.

72
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:15,943
Hey, Walter.

73
00:09:18,895 --> 00:09:20,234
What are you talking about?

74
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:02,869
- Walter.
- Jack.

75
00:10:03,122 --> 00:10:04,035
Thanks for coming.

76
00:10:04,386 --> 00:10:05,318
How's that little thing?

77
00:10:07,485 --> 00:10:11,967
Listen, I wanna introduce to
Jimmy... Pettis.

78
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:19,239
Hey, Jimmy. Jack Mancini, Grand Rapids
Police Department. How are you?

79
00:10:20,045 --> 00:10:20,934
Walter.

80
00:10:22,045 --> 00:10:23,555
Relax about that.

81
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:26,609
I know Walter for years.

82
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:27,542
Walter.

83
00:10:27,734 --> 00:10:28,883
Besides, it's my night off.

84
00:10:29,164 --> 00:10:32,518
He seemed mesmerized
here by your story, ha?

85
00:10:34,062 --> 00:10:35,294
Hey, that's something.

86
00:10:35,832 --> 00:10:39,244
It's only you, you work at the
Grand Hotel, ha?

87
00:10:40,324 --> 00:10:41,721
How long have you
been employed there?

88
00:10:42,723 --> 00:10:43,838
You still work there?

89
00:10:47,492 --> 00:10:48,709
What do you do for it now?

90
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,447
Me?

91
00:10:50,054 --> 00:10:52,324
I'm the head of General Motors.

92
00:10:53,595 --> 00:10:55,299
So, what's all this
about the steam room?

93
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:58,887
Nothing. Apparently, Walter.

94
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:05,303
Just that, six people are locked in one,
and in about two hours they're gonna die.

95
00:11:06,587 --> 00:11:07,832
Let me get this straight.

96
00:11:09,563 --> 00:11:12,478
You've got six people locked
right now in a steam room?

97
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:17,485
Ever sit in 130 degrees, detective?

98
00:11:17,657 --> 00:11:19,388
Do you know what happens
to the body in about two hours?

99
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:24,762
The lungs melt.
The eyes cauterize.

100
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:28,604
If you want to play Trivial Pursuit,

101
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:31,525
...it's on your head, Walter.

102
00:11:33,452 --> 00:11:34,310
All right, Pettis.

103
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:36,210
Call me Jimmy.

104
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:37,219
Oh, Jimmy.

105
00:11:38,522 --> 00:11:39,517
Listen,

106
00:11:41,383 --> 00:11:43,384
...let's take this slow, ok?

107
00:11:44,055 --> 00:11:46,437
Walter and I are just a
couple of pedestrians here.

108
00:11:47,668 --> 00:11:49,584
You know, we are not...
we are not men of great intellect...

109
00:11:51,105 --> 00:11:51,872
...like you,

110
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,057
...and, just tell us.

111
00:11:55,647 --> 00:11:56,607
Why are you here?

112
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:02,999
According to the long count
of the Mayan calender,

113
00:12:04,877 --> 00:12:09,796
...history is going to end in 2012, not
because of spiritual enlightenment,

114
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:14,230
Hundreds of millions of people
are going to die, that's fact.

115
00:12:14,406 --> 00:12:16,721
Hundreds of millions of
people will to die, how?

116
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:18,162
Global warming.

117
00:12:18,785 --> 00:12:22,198
130 degrees
in the middle of December.

118
00:12:22,807 --> 00:12:25,742
That's a fact. Three years.

119
00:12:28,395 --> 00:12:30,146
The midwest will be under water,

120
00:12:32,116 --> 00:12:34,144
...swallowed by the great lakes.

121
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,888
Years of corn will be sold
by the highest bidder.

122
00:12:37,637 --> 00:12:42,235
Chaos, anarchy, the de-evolution
of society as we know it.

123
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:45,361
All for one and not a soul for all.

124
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:52,436
De-evolution, chaos, anarchy. Gonna make
New Orleans look like a candy store.

125
00:12:55,419 --> 00:12:59,662
Let me get this straight. You've got 6 people
locked right now in a steam room,

126
00:13:01,343 --> 00:13:04,057
...because you think
the world is gonna end in 2012?

127
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:06,611
My calculations are quite precise.

128
00:13:08,192 --> 00:13:09,791
- Global warming?
- Global warming.

129
00:13:10,172 --> 00:13:14,135
Jimmy, the affects of global warming
are projected to occur for another...

130
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,605
50 years? That's a lie.
In fact, detective,

131
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:20,508
...the affects of global warming...

132
00:13:21,615 --> 00:13:25,371
...can be seen right now,
because they're being filmed.

133
00:13:28,137 --> 00:13:30,060
You are filming what?

134
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,451
Who?

135
00:13:32,827 --> 00:13:34,660
Hold on a second,
let's back up.

136
00:13:35,704 --> 00:13:38,504
Jimmy, I'm gonna give
you what you want.

137
00:13:39,148 --> 00:13:41,249
All right? You want the front page?
I'm gonna give it to you, ok?

138
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:44,637
Above the fold, Walter,
above the fold.

139
00:13:45,393 --> 00:13:47,576
Right. Absolutely.

140
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:48,616
So, we have an agreement?

141
00:13:52,355 --> 00:13:55,343
You got your headline.
Now, here is what I want:

142
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,458
I want the names of the hostages,
right now.

143
00:13:58,859 --> 00:14:00,090
I wanna know where they are.

144
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:05,954
I'm not naive, detective. I wanna
see my headline, in big bold print.

145
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,080
Then I'll tell you where they are.

146
00:14:14,615 --> 00:14:15,440
Proof.

147
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:41,565
So Jesus sent the Virgin Mary who
decided to join the party, hah?

148
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,038
Frank, how're you doing?

149
00:15:51,342 --> 00:15:52,989
- Christopher.
- Christopher?

150
00:15:53,304 --> 00:15:54,303
Good to meet you, brother.

151
00:15:55,145 --> 00:15:57,351
- Grant.
- I'm Christopher.

152
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:00,213
- Hey, how you doing man?
- Great, good to meet you, Frank.

153
00:16:01,514 --> 00:16:03,032
It's hot in here, ha?

154
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:07,034
Oh, Pettis told me that you're,
drafted by the cowboys?

155
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:08,886
In 1982.

156
00:16:13,343 --> 00:16:18,055
Somebody must have turned up the steam,
temperature just went up above a 100 degrees.

157
00:16:18,337 --> 00:16:19,286
Hi, I'm Catherine.

158
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:21,605
- I'm Grant, nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

159
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,720
- I'm Margaret.
- It's a pleasure, Margaret.

160
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:25,384
It's hot.

161
00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:27,958
- I'm Christopher.
- Hi.

162
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:31,774
Here we go, here we go.

163
00:16:34,397 --> 00:16:35,618
Come on.

164
00:16:37,238 --> 00:16:38,662
Frank, Frank.

165
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:48,452
I have a suggestion. Why don't we all say a few
words about ourselves and get acquainted?

166
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:58,994
It's a wonderful idea. But, let's do it fast.
Just a couple of sentences, nothing more.

167
00:16:59,173 --> 00:17:00,792
James Pettis, if you're watching this.

168
00:17:01,956 --> 00:17:04,174
I love you man,
you are a fucking genius.

169
00:17:16,438 --> 00:17:17,676
I'm an actress,

170
00:17:19,086 --> 00:17:20,816
...a former actress,

171
00:17:22,181 --> 00:17:24,282
...it didn't all work out the way I'd hoped.

172
00:17:25,106 --> 00:17:28,579
I'm from New York, as in Manhattan.

173
00:17:29,963 --> 00:17:33,945
Like...
I like that's dengerous,

174
00:17:36,845 --> 00:17:38,264
I like falling in love.

175
00:17:39,532 --> 00:17:41,135
That'd be dangerous.

176
00:17:42,184 --> 00:17:43,320
Dislike?

177
00:17:44,952 --> 00:17:46,090
When it's over.

178
00:17:47,964 --> 00:17:48,974
Ok, my turn.

179
00:17:49,828 --> 00:17:51,141
Ex football player,

180
00:17:51,701 --> 00:17:54,502
I run a charter boat
outside Detroit,

181
00:17:55,072 --> 00:17:57,088
I'm from Dallas Fort Worth originally.

182
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:58,551
Likes...

183
00:18:00,244 --> 00:18:01,455
Viagra.

184
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:05,301
Dislikes, the fact that I need viagra.

185
00:18:06,945 --> 00:18:08,815
Just keeping it real, Frank.

186
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:11,574
I own an Italian
restaurant in Brooklyn.

187
00:18:12,108 --> 00:18:14,370
Is it yours, you're
in the management, or?

188
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:17,896
That's funny.
Yeah, you're funny.

189
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:22,334
Listen, anybody comes
to New York, I hook you up.

190
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:25,046
I got the best Italian
food in all five burrows.

191
00:18:26,114 --> 00:18:29,413
I'm from Brooklyn.
Born in ... you know.

192
00:18:31,431 --> 00:18:32,624
I like...

193
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:38,614
...chicks that know what they want.

194
00:18:39,129 --> 00:18:42,212
When they want it,
where they want it.

195
00:18:43,032 --> 00:18:46,295
And then not afraid to tell you
right to your face, you know?

196
00:18:49,979 --> 00:18:51,237
Dislikes?

197
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,709
Nothing, I love everybody you know
what I mean, forget about it.

198
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:05,752
I work for a small
publisher in Connecticut.

199
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:09,263
I can listen you talk all day.

200
00:19:14,437 --> 00:19:16,752
I'm from San Francisco, California.

201
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,081
Like...

202
00:19:27,093 --> 00:19:31,716
I like living the life of a neurotic.

203
00:19:32,841 --> 00:19:34,417
Struggling.

204
00:19:35,392 --> 00:19:36,598
Bored at times.

205
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:40,351
Introspective, sensitive.

206
00:19:41,142 --> 00:19:45,975
You're a typically fucked up
American romance writer,

207
00:19:46,493 --> 00:19:48,610
...who fancies herself a poet.

208
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,377
Dislike...

209
00:20:03,055 --> 00:20:04,596
Therapy twice a week.

210
00:20:04,854 --> 00:20:08,499
I'm a nurse. I'm from
Scranton, Pensilvania.

211
00:20:13,454 --> 00:20:18,462
I'm sorry, I don't want to
ruin everybody's weekend.

212
00:20:24,497 --> 00:20:25,537
My wife.

213
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:35,822
My wife died in a car
accident nine months ago.

214
00:20:37,373 --> 00:20:38,432
I'm sorry.

215
00:20:42,188 --> 00:20:44,540
I didn't think it was a
good idea to come.

216
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:53,194
And then I told to myself:
"Why not"?

217
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:56,904
Waitress, born in Atlanta,
live in Detroit.

218
00:20:57,864 --> 00:20:58,996
Likes...

219
00:21:00,732 --> 00:21:02,740
Money, and lots of it.

220
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:05,235
Dislike...

221
00:21:08,212 --> 00:21:10,474
It's worth that hate,

222
00:21:10,922 --> 00:21:14,195
...who really fucking hates.

223
00:21:14,863 --> 00:21:18,678
And a guy thinks who can grab your ass
just because he left you a 3 dollar tip.

224
00:21:20,227 --> 00:21:22,067
I fucking hate that.

225
00:21:24,435 --> 00:21:25,279
All right.

226
00:21:25,987 --> 00:21:29,294
Now that we're done with whole
getting to know together bullshit,

227
00:21:34,156 --> 00:21:37,180
...I think I'm gonna enjoy a little steam.

228
00:22:16,354 --> 00:22:17,388
Nice.

229
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:20,426
They're real?

230
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:28,255
Yeah, they're real. And that's
as close as you'll ever fucking get.

231
00:22:50,074 --> 00:22:51,909
Nothing on Pettis,
what about Gregory?

232
00:22:53,135 --> 00:22:54,168
Raymond Gregory.

233
00:22:57,468 --> 00:22:59,815
Do me a favor, run a
search on steam baths.

234
00:23:01,086 --> 00:23:02,745
Steam rooms, yeah.

235
00:23:04,193 --> 00:23:06,109
Good.

236
00:23:08,352 --> 00:23:13,950
Ok, Raymond Gregory. Professor
Curtis University, late 80s.

237
00:23:14,265 --> 00:23:15,749
He's got degrees of the Ying-Yang.

238
00:23:16,264 --> 00:23:19,471
I found a review online
of one of his books,

239
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,546
...both of which are out of print,
by the way.

240
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:27,021
Gregory pseudo scientific mambo jambo
borders on the delusional.

241
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,727
Review goes on to say, it's
laughably ludicruous and long-winded.

242
00:23:31,506 --> 00:23:33,658
Curtis canned him shortly thereafter.

243
00:23:34,326 --> 00:23:35,605
There's no pictures on this one?

244
00:23:35,927 --> 00:23:36,683
Nothing.

245
00:23:38,607 --> 00:23:40,413
I found this on his file.

246
00:23:40,993 --> 00:23:42,521
At least he's seeing a shrink.

247
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:45,333
Which I could afford to see.

248
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,563
No surprises there.

249
00:23:47,891 --> 00:23:49,507
Do you think that
perhaps he is Gregory?

250
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,698
Jack, I don't know
what to think of this guy.

251
00:23:54,056 --> 00:23:55,405
Maybe he thinks he is Gregory.

252
00:23:57,647 --> 00:23:58,785
He was a thinking man.

253
00:24:00,251 --> 00:24:01,316
Good night.

254
00:24:27,942 --> 00:24:29,188
So, what were you doing in Grand?

255
00:24:30,452 --> 00:24:32,006
Worked security.

256
00:24:33,925 --> 00:24:35,848
I worked security,
back in the day.

257
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:39,484
New York, until I joined the law enforcement.

258
00:24:40,006 --> 00:24:41,272
Boring good dough, heh?

259
00:24:41,682 --> 00:24:43,888
Pays the bills, got time to study.

260
00:24:44,332 --> 00:24:45,837
I bet you do a lot of reading.

261
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:50,679
Heard about the guy called Gregory?
He is a smart guy?

262
00:24:50,932 --> 00:24:52,765
Raymond Gregory is a genius.

263
00:24:53,672 --> 00:24:54,940
What do you think happened to him?

264
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:57,072
Government ruined him.

265
00:24:58,084 --> 00:25:00,565
Noone took his work seriously.

266
00:25:01,282 --> 00:25:03,578
Light years ahead of this time,
light years.

267
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:09,710
No, you're not wasting my time.
But 6 people are locked in a steam room.

268
00:25:09,962 --> 00:25:11,144
And they are all going to die.

269
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,874
I'm gonna ask you about them later.

270
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,950
Walter said you started some
kind of an online dating service.

271
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:23,431
Take them to the Grand at least?
Had a few laughs, did you?

272
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:24,910
That's bold.

273
00:25:25,168 --> 00:25:26,967
Bold? It's brilliant.

274
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:30,712
Web site? A bunch of said and lonely
people are gonna find something, love?

275
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:35,945
In the dream. Hope.
What's more beautiful on earth?

276
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,832
I'm pulling the new
age bullshit, right?

277
00:25:42,284 --> 00:25:44,822
You get them all pumped up,
everybody lucky, right?

278
00:25:45,396 --> 00:25:46,751
They get laid.

279
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:51,446
I gotta hand it to you, Jimmy.

280
00:25:53,003 --> 00:25:54,086
You're a smart guy.

281
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:58,763
It's so easy.
The very nature of sheep.

282
00:25:59,237 --> 00:26:01,012
The sheep got any names?

283
00:26:01,503 --> 00:26:04,761
No. But I can tell you what's
happening to them right now.

284
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:30,182
All right.

285
00:26:30,949 --> 00:26:32,204
That does it for me.

286
00:26:44,934 --> 00:26:46,539
Fucking door is stuck.

287
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:49,272
I'll get it.

288
00:26:54,906 --> 00:26:56,133
Oh god, it's hot.

289
00:28:05,647 --> 00:28:07,176
This is freaking me out.

290
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,925
The fucking wood must swelled up.

291
00:28:13,131 --> 00:28:14,406
It's not the wood.

292
00:28:14,586 --> 00:28:15,558
Then what the fuck is it?

293
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,478
James. James.

294
00:28:19,509 --> 00:28:22,261
Frank, you're gonna hurtl yourself, man.
We can't do a goddamn thing, stop it.

295
00:28:22,578 --> 00:28:24,497
Open the fucking door.

296
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,954
The lungs melt.

297
00:28:27,574 --> 00:28:28,752
The eyes cauterize.

298
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:32,867
Pettis. Open the fucking door.

299
00:28:33,193 --> 00:28:34,382
- Frank.
- Frank, you're gonna hurt yourself.

300
00:28:34,554 --> 00:28:35,618
So what are we
supposed to do then?

301
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,722
Just stay cool, and hope
they come and get us?

302
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:44,086
I'm fucking clostrophobic man.

303
00:28:46,217 --> 00:28:47,766
I need some fucking air.

304
00:28:48,317 --> 00:28:51,954
Some air, ok?
I need some fucking fresh air.

305
00:28:57,801 --> 00:29:01,097
You stop that bullshit right now,
you hear me?

306
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,384
James. Pettis.

307
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:08,696
Frank, you moron.

308
00:29:15,915 --> 00:29:17,270
What did you fucking call me?
You fucking cunt?

309
00:29:17,488 --> 00:29:19,365
No, no, no, come
on buddy, come here.

310
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:20,841
Fucking call me?

311
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:22,701
No, no buddy, come here.

312
00:29:23,008 --> 00:29:24,207
Stop it, everybody.

313
00:29:24,817 --> 00:29:27,479
Everybody please,
just calm down, ok?

314
00:29:30,213 --> 00:29:33,175
We are supposed to have a
massage in like 20 minutes, right?

315
00:29:33,867 --> 00:29:35,119
Cathy has got a point dude,

316
00:29:35,677 --> 00:29:39,150
...the dinner is next
on schedule, right, right?

317
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,239
They are gonna
come get us for dinner.

318
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:41,038
Yeah.

319
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:44,271
What if noone comes down?

320
00:29:46,527 --> 00:29:48,205
Then what?

321
00:30:00,972 --> 00:30:01,953
Come on in.

322
00:30:02,515 --> 00:30:03,570
How you doing, Sam?

323
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:11,339
How long have you known this guy?

324
00:30:12,017 --> 00:30:12,821
6 months.

325
00:30:15,866 --> 00:30:17,668
Jimmy worked the weekend shift.

326
00:30:19,557 --> 00:30:22,605
Then he just disappeared one day.
Stopped showing up for work.

327
00:30:26,095 --> 00:30:26,906
Shit!

328
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,468
This hotel has got
some kind of steam bath?

329
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,295
Was one in the basement.

330
00:30:50,037 --> 00:30:53,174
Which one of you cunts was
the last to touch that fucking door?

331
00:30:58,337 --> 00:31:02,941
It was me.
I was the last one in the door.

332
00:31:06,872 --> 00:31:08,595
I didn't mean to do
anything though, Frank.

333
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:13,519
Frank.

334
00:31:15,771 --> 00:31:20,047
Chill out. They are gonna come down
and get us for dinner. It's gonna be ok.

335
00:31:20,782 --> 00:31:21,858
Sorry.

336
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:27,239
Yeah. They'll come and get us.

337
00:31:28,371 --> 00:31:30,043
- They're gonna come down, right?
- It's gonna be cool.

338
00:31:30,277 --> 00:31:31,285
- Right?
- Yeah, it's gonna be cool.

339
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:32,413
Yeah, it's gonna be cool.

340
00:31:33,662 --> 00:31:35,796
Don't you freak out on us
buddy, come on, sit down.

341
00:31:36,212 --> 00:31:37,670
Sit down right here with me.

342
00:32:00,605 --> 00:32:02,215
So, there is nothing
to worry about?

343
00:32:03,147 --> 00:32:05,082
We are only trapped
in a fucking steam room.

344
00:32:05,596 --> 00:32:09,300
Will you shut the fuck up.
I told you I'm clostrophobic, ok?

345
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,747
I don't give a shit
what you are.

346
00:32:12,943 --> 00:32:14,902
Fucking bitch.

347
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,987
I'm a bitch?
Am I bitch?

348
00:32:18,556 --> 00:32:22,155
Look at you.
You're a fucking pussy.

349
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:24,087
I'm a bitch?

350
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:28,260
Jessie, stop. We're not trapped,
all right Frank?

351
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:36,616
Funny how everything was cool
until you bitches came in.

352
00:32:36,884 --> 00:32:38,834
Go fuck yourself!

353
00:32:39,013 --> 00:32:40,080
Jessie, stop!

354
00:32:40,432 --> 00:32:41,660
I think that's enough, dude.

355
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:43,397
Back the fuck up, bro.

356
00:32:43,577 --> 00:32:45,765
What, Frank?
I'm warning you, buddy.

357
00:32:46,013 --> 00:32:48,967
- What the fuck are you
gonna do buddy?
- Frank.

358
00:32:49,148 --> 00:32:50,623
You're gonna fucking
stop me, motherfucker?

359
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:52,035
Motherfucker!

360
00:32:52,108 --> 00:32:54,733
We're freaked out here, ok?
Stop.

361
00:32:56,341 --> 00:33:00,229
You fucking bitch.
You're fucking disgusting.

362
00:33:03,897 --> 00:33:06,896
You actually like this guy?
He's a fucking looser.

363
00:33:07,387 --> 00:33:13,053
I think you're full of shit.
Fucking pussies like you don't play football.

364
00:33:13,816 --> 00:33:17,545
Frank.
You don't have to do this, Frank.

365
00:33:20,342 --> 00:33:23,857
Just keep it togethert,
pull it together Frank.

366
00:33:27,276 --> 00:33:32,004
Pull it together,
everybody, everybody.

367
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:34,351
Everybody.

368
00:33:34,623 --> 00:33:35,680
Fuck you all.

369
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,057
Pettis!

370
00:33:48,562 --> 00:33:51,532
Was? What do you mean was?

371
00:33:52,193 --> 00:33:53,832
They destroyed it 3 months ago.

372
00:33:54,472 --> 00:33:57,755
They're building some kind of underground
parking ramp down there something.

373
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:00,032
The hotel is under renovation.

374
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:03,444
Ain't nothing left.
They're turning it into condos.

375
00:34:08,295 --> 00:34:10,980
I never said it was the Grand.

376
00:34:14,015 --> 00:34:15,129
I'm sorry to bother you.

377
00:34:18,592 --> 00:34:19,524
See you.

378
00:34:44,226 --> 00:34:44,863
Frank.

379
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:48,237
Please stop, please!

380
00:34:48,279 --> 00:34:49,518
Frank, what are you doing?

381
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,119
Shut up!

382
00:35:14,747 --> 00:35:15,823
Getting in a trap, Frank.

383
00:35:17,525 --> 00:35:18,886
Frank, stop.

384
00:35:22,195 --> 00:35:23,154
You're dead.

385
00:35:52,105 --> 00:35:53,605
Come here.

386
00:35:56,706 --> 00:35:57,821
Get off off me!

387
00:36:00,196 --> 00:36:02,160
Frank, stop it! No!

388
00:36:09,378 --> 00:36:14,876
Fucking bitch, you fucking bitch!
You're gonna die!

389
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:51,963
One down, detective.

390
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:59,611
Yeah, this is a message for
Dr. Alexander Adams.

391
00:37:59,987 --> 00:38:02,432
It's detective Jack Mancini,
Grand Rapids Police Department.

392
00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:05,541
I'm holding one of your patient sir,
Mr. James Pettis.

393
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:13,310
You call me back as soon as possible, sir? I'm at
555-0221. All right, as soon as you can sir, thank you.

394
00:38:14,721 --> 00:38:16,802
Hope you send it
to my wallet, detective.

395
00:38:18,258 --> 00:38:20,555
So you tell your shrink?
About your experiment?

396
00:38:21,052 --> 00:38:24,148
Why don't you call and ask him?
Oh, wait. You already did.

397
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:27,840
It's funny how most perhaps tell
their mother before they first up to a crime.

398
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,062
Here you're walking
in a newspaper office,

399
00:38:31,032 --> 00:38:33,088
...yacking you're
holding 6 people hostage.

400
00:38:33,627 --> 00:38:36,231
So let's say you get your headline,
you know what you're looking at?

401
00:38:36,561 --> 00:38:38,044
Six people hostage in a steam room?

402
00:38:38,332 --> 00:38:39,757
They'll lock you up, pal.

403
00:38:41,226 --> 00:38:42,416
No way to key.

404
00:38:42,759 --> 00:38:44,518
It's not about me, detective.

405
00:38:44,832 --> 00:38:50,875
I know, I know. It's all about
the global warming in fact. Saving the world.

406
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:57,157
Yeah, Mancini. Hey, how hot you're still
waiting for? I'm gonna be there in an hour.

407
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:02,660
God help me.

408
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:08,904
- You underestimate the situation, detective.
- Why, what's your smile about?

409
00:39:09,077 --> 00:39:13,477
Biggest case in your life, you wanna
meet a girl in a bar in an hour.

410
00:39:13,657 --> 00:39:16,612
- I don't underestimate the situation whatsoever.
- Pathetic.

411
00:39:17,065 --> 00:39:20,243
Listen man, you're holding
6 people hostage,

412
00:39:21,871 --> 00:39:24,206
...you're going to jail,
for the rest of your life.

413
00:39:25,391 --> 00:39:27,766
If not, they'll get you a luny thing.

414
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:35,113
Me? Yeah, I got my late night rendezvous here.
Biggest blue eyes you ever saw.

415
00:39:37,363 --> 00:39:38,879
Who is pathetic now, champ?

416
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,493
Who is pathetic now?

417
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:06,167
What do you got?

418
00:40:08,417 --> 00:40:11,101
Says, he locked 6 people
in a steam room.

419
00:40:11,706 --> 00:40:13,466
Because of global warming.

420
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:17,203
Says, the end of the world is coming.

421
00:40:18,504 --> 00:40:21,753
That's what we need. Another
nutjob walking in the streets.

422
00:40:22,032 --> 00:40:23,055
At least he is original.

423
00:40:24,715 --> 00:40:26,549
I put a call into the shrink.

424
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:33,173
Something about the way he
describes the hostages, it's too precise.

425
00:40:34,291 --> 00:40:35,493
There's too many details.

426
00:40:36,036 --> 00:40:39,288
Jack. This guy looks
like a nut case.

427
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:42,809
I'll give you 30 minutes with him,
get what you can and we cut him loose.

428
00:40:43,012 --> 00:40:45,388
I got a burglary down out Fletcher,
I need you out there.

429
00:40:45,573 --> 00:40:46,374
It's my night off.

430
00:40:46,725 --> 00:40:47,768
Yeah, well you're here now.

431
00:41:04,677 --> 00:41:08,817
Hey, Jack. I called every hotel in
Grand Rapids with a steam room. No hostages.

432
00:41:09,106 --> 00:41:10,827
- There's no health clubs?
- All closed.

433
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:11,732
Closed?

434
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:14,932
Call the security companies down.
Check every one alarm.

435
00:41:15,208 --> 00:41:17,413
Call every internet dating
service in Michigan.

436
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:18,626
Lonely, Sir?

437
00:41:18,905 --> 00:41:21,762
Yeah. Cross reference it
with his name, Pettis.

438
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:23,418
James Pettis.

439
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,397
James Pe... Is that two t's?

440
00:41:26,883 --> 00:41:29,233
Two t's. Make it snappy.

441
00:41:30,043 --> 00:41:31,309
Only speed I know.

442
00:42:09,117 --> 00:42:11,111
Where have you been in the last 3 months?

443
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:19,543
European vacation.
Have you ever been to Italy, detective?

444
00:42:19,707 --> 00:42:22,746
Of course you have. Weather
is lovely this time of year.

445
00:42:31,877 --> 00:42:33,380
Now you listen to me, asshole.

446
00:42:35,374 --> 00:42:37,037
You're wasting my fucking time now.

447
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,974
You're gonna give me
the full names of the hostages,

448
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:43,991
...or I'm gonna rip them
out of your fucking head.

449
00:42:44,885 --> 00:42:47,335
One by fucking one.

450
00:42:49,049 --> 00:42:51,122
Is that how they
do it in New York?

451
00:42:51,915 --> 00:42:53,094
Intimidate?

452
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:57,246
To get a confession?

453
00:42:58,981 --> 00:43:00,511
You're pathetic, detective.

454
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:07,775
You could've been retired by now,
so you do this for fun?

455
00:43:08,462 --> 00:43:09,448
What else you do?

456
00:43:10,103 --> 00:43:13,044
Chasing middle-age fluzies
around crap-ass bars?

457
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:17,762
Blinding them with vodka, and lies,
telling them how good they look for over 50?

458
00:43:19,101 --> 00:43:20,621
Oh, detective.

459
00:43:21,269 --> 00:43:24,406
No. No. I see right
through you, detective.

460
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:29,149
You do not have the intellectual
capacity for this case.

461
00:43:30,933 --> 00:43:32,268
You should go.

462
00:43:58,476 --> 00:43:59,980
Let's talk about you.

463
00:44:01,916 --> 00:44:03,269
Who do fuck are you?

464
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,848
Jimmy Pettis, yeah?

465
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:12,548
- What kind of life are you trying to keep your wit on?
- Your vulgarity is pathetic.

466
00:44:12,824 --> 00:44:14,633
- My vulgarity?
- It annoys me.

467
00:44:16,664 --> 00:44:22,727
The pinky ring, and cheap cologne.
And cheap sip.

468
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:27,821
What did you say about my suit?

469
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,459
You wanna play bad cop, hah?

470
00:44:29,702 --> 00:44:31,567
- What did you say about my suit?
- Ok, ok.

471
00:44:33,503 --> 00:44:36,143
Let's play bad cop. Ok.

472
00:44:38,912 --> 00:44:42,239
Ok, let's play bad cop.

473
00:44:48,967 --> 00:44:52,394
You go get Walter,
before somebody else dies.

474
00:45:22,622 --> 00:45:23,485
Catherine?

475
00:45:28,053 --> 00:45:29,159
Catherine?

476
00:46:16,408 --> 00:46:20,795
I want to go.
Get me out of here.

477
00:46:32,797 --> 00:46:36,243
We're trapped.
We're trapped.

478
00:46:37,579 --> 00:46:39,437
Somebody has locked us in here.

479
00:46:47,151 --> 00:46:48,203
What now?

480
00:46:49,552 --> 00:46:52,318
It is that sick fuck
locked us in on purpose.

481
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:59,708
Give me break. An online dating
service gives away 5000 dollars.

482
00:47:01,169 --> 00:47:02,605
We're trapped.

483
00:47:04,434 --> 00:47:08,300
It was weird from the get go.
Come on!

484
00:47:11,752 --> 00:47:13,918
Pettis knew what he was doing.

485
00:47:18,193 --> 00:47:19,272
I don't have anyone.

486
00:47:21,366 --> 00:47:24,434
I don't have anyone
who's gonna look for me.

487
00:47:26,974 --> 00:47:28,085
Do you?

488
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:47,611
What about you, Catherine?
Is anyone coming for you?

489
00:47:48,126 --> 00:47:53,559
No, Jessie.
Nobody is coming for me either.

490
00:48:01,524 --> 00:48:04,464
Grant!
Grant!

491
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,383
Grant, I'm talking to you.

492
00:48:19,003 --> 00:48:21,966
Grant!
Grant!

493
00:48:34,191 --> 00:48:35,150
You.

494
00:48:37,954 --> 00:48:41,892
Noone is going to be looking for me.

495
00:48:43,085 --> 00:48:46,149
My whole life, not even my parents.

496
00:48:47,156 --> 00:48:53,697
But if I focus on that, I will lose my mind.
So, what I'm gonna focus on

497
00:48:53,908 --> 00:48:58,072
is getting us out of here.
So you shot your mouth.

498
00:48:59,644 --> 00:49:03,904
Your big mouth
has caused us a big problem.

499
00:49:04,623 --> 00:49:09,506
You onyl open you mouth to breathe,
do you understand?

500
00:49:11,556 --> 00:49:14,243
Do you understand me?
Do you understand me?

501
00:49:26,392 --> 00:49:31,230
Now. There is a logical
explanation for everything.

502
00:49:32,575 --> 00:49:36,268
Only thing that's going wrong,
is the door got jammed.

503
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:39,145
All right, nobody locked us in here,
the door jammed people, right?

504
00:49:39,484 --> 00:49:40,456
Right, Christopher?

505
00:49:40,652 --> 00:49:44,218
And that son of a bitch.
That son of a bitch lost his mind.

506
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:47,296
That's all what's going wrong, right?

507
00:49:57,252 --> 00:49:58,477
Grant?

508
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:00,425
What, Catherine?

509
00:50:10,093 --> 00:50:11,783
There's a crack in the window.

510
00:50:16,626 --> 00:50:17,846
Christopher.

511
00:50:31,912 --> 00:50:34,930
Help us, help us.

512
00:50:40,088 --> 00:50:41,963
Christopher, do something.

513
00:50:46,004 --> 00:50:47,924
Help.

514
00:50:54,837 --> 00:50:56,811
Help us.

515
00:51:07,857 --> 00:51:09,468
Pettis!

516
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:16,896
Please.

517
00:51:20,021 --> 00:51:23,852
Ok, one of you girls, get your head out
to see what's blocking the door.

518
00:51:27,554 --> 00:51:28,714
- I'll do it.
- Good girl.

519
00:51:28,927 --> 00:51:32,650
Ok, you lie down to your face first,
I'll lift you up, ok?

520
00:51:32,863 --> 00:51:33,487
Ready?

521
00:51:33,664 --> 00:51:35,636
Don't drop me.
Don't drop me!

522
00:51:35,956 --> 00:51:36,954
Make sure you got her.

523
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:37,796
I got her.

524
00:51:38,043 --> 00:51:39,247
- Here we go.
- Is she ok?

525
00:51:41,822 --> 00:51:42,957
Let me up, let me up.

526
00:51:43,161 --> 00:51:44,177
- Watch the glass.
- Ok.

527
00:51:53,384 --> 00:51:56,723
I don't see anything,
nothing is blocking the door.

528
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:58,195
There must be something.

529
00:51:58,351 --> 00:52:00,086
There's nothing blocking the door.

530
00:52:01,054 --> 00:52:03,536
I see the pipe.
Pettis!

531
00:52:03,989 --> 00:52:06,471
- Jessie, what happened?
- Pettis!

532
00:52:07,715 --> 00:52:09,730
- We got her.
- Pettis!

533
00:52:15,504 --> 00:52:17,220
The lights went out,
I can't see anything.

534
00:52:18,763 --> 00:52:20,280
What do you mean the lights went out?

535
00:52:21,732 --> 00:52:25,504
The lights. I can't see!
I can't see!

536
00:52:26,448 --> 00:52:28,445
Help!

537
00:52:33,101 --> 00:52:35,758
Someone's here. Help us.
Está aqui alguém! Ajude-nos.

538
00:52:36,772 --> 00:52:38,668
- Someone is coming.
- Jessie, what's happening?

539
00:52:38,943 --> 00:52:41,393
Help us, we're locked in the steam room.

540
00:52:41,436 --> 00:52:44,374
Help. Thank you, thank you.

541
00:52:51,783 --> 00:52:52,847
What happened?

542
00:52:53,228 --> 00:52:56,095
- Do you have her?
- Yes, yes. I got her.

543
00:52:56,562 --> 00:53:00,252
Don't twist her. Don't twist her.
It's ok, Jessie. It's ok.

544
00:53:01,175 --> 00:53:03,034
We got you.
We got you.

545
00:53:05,174 --> 00:53:06,872
Roll her over here, don't twist her.

546
00:53:07,535 --> 00:53:10,931
Oh, my god!
What is that!

547
00:53:12,333 --> 00:53:13,673
My god.

548
00:53:23,747 --> 00:53:25,152
My god.

549
00:53:44,332 --> 00:53:47,516
Dating services with internet
addresses in Michigan.

550
00:53:48,432 --> 00:53:50,340
Nothing with the name Pettis.

551
00:53:50,662 --> 00:53:52,580
You check the ones
giving away cash prizes?

552
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:56,252
Free weekends at these hotels.

553
00:53:58,091 --> 00:54:02,444
All of them have give aways, detective.
That's how they get people to sign up and pay.

554
00:54:03,253 --> 00:54:06,057
The only Turkish bath I found
was at the Grand Hotel.

555
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:11,664
But here is something. I can't find anything
on James Pettis in the state of Michigan.

556
00:54:11,918 --> 00:54:15,034
No driver's licence. His social
security doesn't match.

557
00:54:15,272 --> 00:54:16,329
What do you mean it doesn't match?

558
00:54:16,594 --> 00:54:20,643
His W-4 at the hotel.
Pettis used a fake number.

559
00:54:21,185 --> 00:54:27,465
I take it back. It's a real number, it just
belongs to someone in Florida who died 30 years ago.

560
00:54:29,028 --> 00:54:31,731
Tell Clarck I'm gonna book him
on the suspicion of homicide.

561
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:33,395
I'll run his prints.

562
00:55:02,245 --> 00:55:03,788
Let's go back to where we left off.

563
00:55:04,477 --> 00:55:06,010
Jessie dies.

564
00:55:06,153 --> 00:55:07,570
Were you having trouble to follow the story, detective?
Tem algum problema
em seguir a história?

565
00:55:07,689 --> 00:55:12,191
No, I follow the story. One thing I can't see here
though. Jessie is killed by a guy with a nail gun, right?

566
00:55:13,513 --> 00:55:14,856
Ok, so who killed her then?

567
00:55:17,254 --> 00:55:17,926
You?

568
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:23,333
Because Jessie was supposed to
have died by a natural human reaction.

569
00:55:23,592 --> 00:55:25,497
A reaction that is
global warming, right?

570
00:55:25,738 --> 00:55:26,671
So that doesn't add up.

571
00:55:27,277 --> 00:55:30,960
Which show that your plan Jimmy,
enough itself is fucked up.

572
00:55:31,429 --> 00:55:34,904
You know, the mother of all experiments,
it's not airtight. It's not tight.

573
00:55:35,186 --> 00:55:38,446
All this shit about "I gotta talk to Walter,
I wanna be on the front page now,

574
00:55:38,663 --> 00:55:42,021
"...I wanna set everyone free." is all shit,
cause it's not happening now.

575
00:55:42,866 --> 00:55:45,973
Never was happening now. And if it was
happening now, how the fuck did you know?

576
00:55:46,813 --> 00:55:50,580
How the fuck did you now Jessie got
hit with a fucking nail gun, Jimmy? How?

577
00:55:53,399 --> 00:55:55,127
I don't know.

578
00:55:55,481 --> 00:55:59,863
You don't know? I'm fucking all over you.
You lock 6 people in a steam room?

579
00:56:00,188 --> 00:56:02,587
Yeah, before the construction
began at the Grand Hotel.

580
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:05,528
And they are dead in there,
for months Jimmy. They're dead.

581
00:56:10,417 --> 00:56:11,886
Now look at me
when I'm talking to you.

582
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:14,426
Where are the bodies?

583
00:56:15,742 --> 00:56:17,261
Where are the bodies?

584
00:56:28,846 --> 00:56:29,596
Fuck it.

585
00:56:35,891 --> 00:56:39,840
Is there a possibility here,
none of this ever happened?

586
00:56:43,178 --> 00:56:44,450
You're not even Jimmy Pettis.

587
00:56:49,181 --> 00:56:50,510
You're just a whacko.

588
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:53,698
Who are you?

589
00:56:58,487 --> 00:57:00,015
Are you Raymond Gregory?

590
00:57:04,702 --> 00:57:08,924
You're a delusional,
you understand that?

591
00:57:12,676 --> 00:57:19,614
Jimmy, all this convoluted, concocted theory
about global warming, man. Give it a rest.

592
00:57:21,107 --> 00:57:21,914
It's over.

593
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:27,407
It's over. Your life's work has been
pissed upon man, it's been trashed.

594
00:57:28,899 --> 00:57:31,739
Your existence, it was
rendered, a fucking lie.

595
00:57:33,598 --> 00:57:34,930
A lie.

596
00:57:37,943 --> 00:57:39,915
You kill six people?

597
00:57:41,507 --> 00:57:42,600
You don't qualify.

598
00:57:46,581 --> 00:57:48,403
You do it in your imagination.

599
00:57:51,439 --> 00:57:58,862
Either I killed them months ago
detective, or I'm insane and...

600
00:57:59,514 --> 00:58:01,412
...I made it all up,
make up your mind.

601
00:58:01,933 --> 00:58:06,033
I mean when I said earlier that you're
not qualified to handle this case,

602
00:58:06,343 --> 00:58:08,974
I made a mistake,
that was a gross understatement.

603
00:58:09,404 --> 00:58:13,305
It pisses me to see you all excited
to find out who may have killed Jessie.

604
00:58:13,851 --> 00:58:16,505
And maybe I have an
accomplice, maybe I don't.

605
00:58:18,163 --> 00:58:22,609
It pisses me even more that
you can't keep your pee-head on...

606
00:58:23,314 --> 00:58:25,397
...the bigger picture, there
is a bigger picture here.

607
00:58:25,683 --> 00:58:29,745
I mean I'm only continuing with the
experiment to prove what happens to people...

608
00:58:30,054 --> 00:58:31,922
...during the chaos,
because of the heat.

609
00:58:32,439 --> 00:58:35,241
The lives of these
hostages are of no value.

610
00:58:36,505 --> 00:58:39,503
You have a job,
that is your bigger picture...

611
00:58:39,954 --> 00:58:43,329
To get Walter to put
my story in the paper.

612
00:58:44,931 --> 00:58:47,899
And, I'll level with you, this..

613
00:58:48,656 --> 00:58:50,148
You've gotta do
better than this...

614
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:53,663
...fake social security.

615
00:58:54,886 --> 00:58:56,900
Oh, you're gonna level with me?
Then I'm gonna level with you.

616
00:58:57,091 --> 00:58:59,275
I'm gonna tell you exactly
what I told you in Walter's office.

617
00:58:59,557 --> 00:59:02,829
You give me the full names and
locations of these hostages, ok?

618
00:59:03,032 --> 00:59:04,168
Then you get your 15 minutes of fame.

619
00:59:05,054 --> 00:59:07,514
You don't give me the proof.
You don't get your headline.

620
00:59:11,321 --> 00:59:12,780
I really don't give a fuck.

621
00:59:14,006 --> 00:59:15,053
I really don't.

622
00:59:16,584 --> 00:59:18,199
About global warming.

623
00:59:20,204 --> 00:59:21,421
Greenhouse gas.

624
00:59:26,179 --> 00:59:28,449
Jack, I gotta talk to you.

625
00:59:37,595 --> 00:59:40,369
A psychiatrist called,
and he sent this over.

626
00:59:40,887 --> 00:59:43,438
In the last 6 months
professor Raymond Gregory...

627
00:59:43,652 --> 00:59:47,288
...has confessed to his psychiatrist
every major assassination in the US.

628
00:59:47,523 --> 00:59:48,705
He played you, Jack.

629
00:59:49,234 --> 00:59:51,818
He escaped from the mental
ward of state hospital.

630
00:59:51,966 --> 00:59:53,361
So he is professor Raymond Gregory.

631
00:59:53,962 --> 00:59:55,662
I surmised that.

632
00:59:55,501 --> 00:59:57,768
Well, they're sending
somebody to pick him up.

633
00:59:57,979 --> 01:00:00,265
So what does it proove? It prooves
he is a nutcase. It's all it prooves.

634
01:00:01,236 --> 01:00:03,722
He still could be holding people
hostage, he still could've killed them.

635
01:00:05,319 --> 01:00:08,597
He's too precise, I told you that. He knows
every detail about how these people died.

636
01:00:08,755 --> 01:00:09,521
Jack!

637
01:00:09,893 --> 01:00:11,497
Fucking guy is a frootloop.

638
01:00:11,785 --> 01:00:14,209
So, what if he's a frootloop. Give
me the 30 minutes, I'll crack him.

639
01:00:14,727 --> 01:00:19,758
Jack, I've talked to his psychiatrist,
he's schizophrenic and he's highly delusional.

640
01:00:19,942 --> 01:00:21,738
You understand that?
You've got it? It's over.

641
01:00:22,404 --> 01:00:25,166
Now, get your ass over
to Fletcher street.

642
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:45,980
Your shrink called.
Sent the paperwork.

643
01:00:51,090 --> 01:00:55,511
Says you confessed already,
about killing JFK.

644
01:00:57,539 --> 01:00:58,784
You killed John Lennon?

645
01:00:59,974 --> 01:01:02,601
Did you try to shoot
the Pope in Rome, Jimmy?

646
01:01:08,579 --> 01:01:11,696
This case is closed. I gotta go.

647
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:17,147
Just back to the luny pin pal.

648
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:23,663
Call me crazy if it
makes you feel better.

649
01:01:31,038 --> 01:01:36,513
I'm always gonna miss you.
You have a nice life.

650
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:44,966
I'll tell you where the bodies are.

651
01:02:04,093 --> 01:02:06,336
What is happening?

652
01:02:08,054 --> 01:02:09,547
Oh, God!

653
01:08:04,889 --> 01:08:08,619
Margaret was...
she was unstable anyway.

654
01:08:10,602 --> 01:08:15,487
But you see detective, millions of
people will follow that direction.

655
01:08:15,661 --> 01:08:17,470
That's why
the experiment is so valuable.

656
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:21,786
Many many will kill themselves
when faced man's inhumanity to man.

657
01:08:24,039 --> 01:08:27,456
When the time comes, on that faithful day.
Quando chegar o
momento, nesse fatídico dia.

658
01:08:34,967 --> 01:08:36,341
What happened to you, Raymond?

659
01:08:40,427 --> 01:08:42,613
What possessed you
to become Jimmy?

660
01:08:43,737 --> 01:08:51,891
Teaching was the greatest joy of my life,
to fill a young mind with principles, ideas.

661
01:08:52,539 --> 01:09:01,972
The excitement of the purity
of the potential of facing...

662
01:09:04,259 --> 01:09:08,449
...the new world a better world
than that we live in now.

663
01:09:12,613 --> 01:09:14,634
My father was so proud.

664
01:09:17,393 --> 01:09:19,594
I was top in my class, he...

665
01:09:23,175 --> 01:09:31,246
But was sensitive, sensitive. He was sensitive
and the.. once my theories became clearer,

666
01:09:32,490 --> 01:09:41,061
...and the radical clarity
that was my fate to expound, he...

667
01:09:42,897 --> 01:09:47,209
I could take the derision
and the humiliation, I lived with.

668
01:09:48,343 --> 01:09:52,388
But, but, my father, it
killed him. They killed him.

669
01:09:53,482 --> 01:09:56,423
And they killed Raymond Gregory.

670
01:10:05,003 --> 01:10:07,888
I could still save the world, detective.

671
01:10:20,246 --> 01:10:21,768
What's taking that ambulance so long?

672
01:10:21,956 --> 01:10:22,700
Yes!

673
01:10:26,818 --> 01:10:28,083
You see?

674
01:10:31,385 --> 01:10:33,185
You want to tell me than,
about what happened to the last three?

675
01:10:44,686 --> 01:10:46,702
Look at me.
Look at me.

676
01:10:50,605 --> 01:10:54,077
Why would somebody do this?

677
01:10:56,963 --> 01:10:59,828
My mother died when
I was 8 and a half years old.

678
01:11:00,112 --> 01:11:04,566
She was singing,
and then she hit the floor.

679
01:11:05,631 --> 01:11:08,965
That was the last day
I ever saw my daddy sober.

680
01:11:09,483 --> 01:11:10,926
Look at me, Catherine.

681
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:14,136
Look at me.
Look at me.

682
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:20,341
Christopher, hold me.

683
01:11:31,403 --> 01:11:32,789
What are you laughing at, Grant?

684
01:11:35,326 --> 01:11:37,170
Me? Laughing at a joke, Christopher.

685
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:41,737
I know why I'm gonna die,
Pettis. Good old karma.

686
01:11:42,867 --> 01:11:47,346
Only thing I'm worried about is the joke
might be on me. Might be on me.

687
01:11:47,526 --> 01:11:49,521
I think this is a
joke going on, Christopher.

688
01:11:51,488 --> 01:11:53,082
And I think you are telling that.

689
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:57,441
I think maybe she is
helping you tell it, Christopher.

690
01:11:58,588 --> 01:12:02,803
They say, I ran a red light.

691
01:12:03,386 --> 01:12:04,350
Bam!

692
01:12:04,427 --> 01:12:06,381
Hey, that's like a freak train.

693
01:12:07,667 --> 01:12:12,599
Two of those boys.
They died.

694
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:17,996
It's not over, Grant.

695
01:12:21,391 --> 01:12:22,626
We can still make it.

696
01:12:24,208 --> 01:12:26,877
You are so stupid.

697
01:12:27,970 --> 01:12:30,091
We are still alive.

698
01:12:30,436 --> 01:12:31,992
You keep telling yourself that.

699
01:12:35,093 --> 01:12:37,578
You are so full of shit.

700
01:12:38,331 --> 01:12:41,171
Wait a minute. He can see us,
and he can hear us.

701
01:12:42,798 --> 01:12:47,047
Doesn't that mean that there
is a camera in here? Somewhere?

702
01:12:52,917 --> 01:12:55,809
If he can see us,
where is the camera?

703
01:12:59,673 --> 01:13:04,227
Pettis! Is your buddy down here?
Your old buddy Christopher.

704
01:13:05,228 --> 01:13:07,228
And his girlfriend Catherine.

705
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,656
How long you guys have known each other?
You and Catherine?

706
01:13:12,156 --> 01:13:14,487
You didn't just meet here, did you?
I don't think so, buddy.

707
01:13:15,146 --> 01:13:17,775
Five minutes ago she says there might be a camera in here.
Há cinco minutos atrás ela disse
que talvez haja câmaras aqui.

708
01:13:18,014 --> 01:13:20,621
There is gotta be somewhere,
where they put the camera.

709
01:13:20,835 --> 01:13:23,720
And then... Ah, you
found a camera in here.

710
01:13:24,035 --> 01:13:25,014
I've got something.

711
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,246
Coincidence?

712
01:13:26,609 --> 01:13:28,041
- Give me something.
- What is it?

713
01:13:28,776 --> 01:13:29,571
I don't know.

714
01:13:29,928 --> 01:13:31,230
Grant, give me something heavy!

715
01:13:32,954 --> 01:13:33,892
Give me something.

716
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:38,804
Get me!

717
01:13:40,804 --> 01:13:41,692
Here.

718
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:43,960
There is something here.

719
01:13:50,589 --> 01:13:51,659
What is it?

720
01:13:58,811 --> 01:14:00,176
What is it?

721
01:14:10,258 --> 01:14:13,572
James, open the door.

722
01:14:16,209 --> 01:14:19,995
Look what you've done!
Look what you've done!

723
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:29,029
God!

724
01:14:31,043 --> 01:14:34,624
No, make it stop!

725
01:14:36,645 --> 01:14:38,800
I came here to start a new life!

726
01:14:38,949 --> 01:14:40,370
I'm not buying it.
I'm just not buying it.

727
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,283
Stop!
Son of a bitch!

728
01:14:51,244 --> 01:14:52,468
Be careful.

729
01:15:04,878 --> 01:15:06,166
I feel cool here.

730
01:15:06,916 --> 01:15:08,502
There's gotta be another room in there.

731
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,434
What is it?

732
01:15:13,248 --> 01:15:14,234
Nothing.

733
01:15:40,156 --> 01:15:44,251
Catherine, Catherine.
Look at me.

734
01:15:47,739 --> 01:15:49,857
What, you want me to put my
hand in the hole in the wall?

735
01:15:50,565 --> 01:15:52,689
Like you put Jessie's head
to the hole in the door?

736
01:15:53,469 --> 01:15:56,895
Three nails in her head buddy,
yeah, three nails in her head.

737
01:15:57,985 --> 01:16:01,581
Oh yeah, that's funny. What's next?
You wanna put my hand in the little hole?

738
01:16:01,928 --> 01:16:07,007
My hand in that hole, will be... Gonna chop
my hand off, is that it? Is that it?

739
01:16:07,607 --> 01:16:10,585
I like my hands, Christopher.
I like both of them.

740
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:15,845
Yeah. I've been watching you boy, I've been
watching you. You know what I think?

741
01:16:16,186 --> 01:16:19,683
I think you are a nasty, nasty
little man. That's what I think.

742
01:16:20,163 --> 01:16:23,855
I think you're a nasty little man,
and I think you are friends with Pettis.

743
01:16:24,621 --> 01:16:27,712
Is your buddy down here?
Your old buddy, Christopher?

744
01:16:28,224 --> 01:16:30,515
And his girlfriend Catherine?

745
01:16:30,954 --> 01:16:32,743
How long have you known
Pettis, Christopher?

746
01:16:33,762 --> 01:16:37,117
Make me to laugh at this
joke you guys are going on.

747
01:16:37,755 --> 01:16:42,172
What's happening, boy?
What's going on, Christopher?

748
01:16:44,210 --> 01:16:45,576
That's it.

749
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:47,010
That's it? What's it, boy?

750
01:16:48,311 --> 01:16:49,576
I've had enough.

751
01:16:50,957 --> 01:16:52,542
You've had enough?

752
01:16:52,998 --> 01:16:54,440
Of you!

753
01:16:56,472 --> 01:16:59,080
I've done nothing but
try and keep you calm,

754
01:16:59,451 --> 01:17:01,251
...give you the chance
to get out of here.

755
01:17:02,770 --> 01:17:07,649
Do you wanna lose your mind?
Do you wanna end up like them?

756
01:17:08,713 --> 01:17:12,103
That's what you're aiming
for me to be? Like them?

757
01:17:12,511 --> 01:17:14,605
I don't care about your story, Grant.

758
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:22,594
You're pathetic. I don't
care if you fry in here.

759
01:17:32,807 --> 01:17:35,891
Who is pathetic now, Christopher?

760
01:17:37,034 --> 01:17:43,966
Pettis! I'm coming for your woman.
You're gonna talk, bitch, you're gonna talk.

761
01:17:55,408 --> 01:17:57,126
- Talk.
- Christopher.

762
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:05,814
Will you talk to me?
Will you talk to me?

763
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:38,532
You're the strongest.

764
01:19:43,971 --> 01:19:47,786
Animal instincts, detective.
Only the strongest survive.

765
01:19:48,792 --> 01:19:51,811
My experiment happened
exactly the way I predicted it.

766
01:19:52,414 --> 01:19:56,294
Some will kill themselves, some
will kill, some will go insane.

767
01:19:56,791 --> 01:20:01,148
It's genetic. The faultier brutest
lights not in our stars but in ourselves.

768
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:07,049
I'm gonna try to see to get
the help you need, Raymond.

769
01:20:12,903 --> 01:20:17,918
You got to call Walter.
Yes, call Walter.

770
01:20:18,872 --> 01:20:21,634
Call Walter, call Walter.

771
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:25,130
Call him, call Walter.

772
01:20:49,253 --> 01:20:50,636
It's time, Jack.

773
01:20:50,836 --> 01:20:54,269
Dr. Adams sends his apologies. There is an
emegency on one of the wards tonight.

774
01:20:54,669 --> 01:20:55,692
Yeah, no problem.

775
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,634
I hope he didn't give
you too much trouble.

776
01:20:57,872 --> 01:21:00,925
No, he is not bad.
Guess he'll ajitate it.

777
01:21:01,337 --> 01:21:02,814
Can't hold the twitch, hah?

778
01:21:03,113 --> 01:21:04,416
He needs his medication.

779
01:21:07,137 --> 01:21:08,199
How long have you
been treating him?

780
01:21:08,423 --> 01:21:10,953
He signed himself over as a border
of state about four months ago.

781
01:21:11,391 --> 01:21:13,969
Dr. Adams has been treating
him aggressively ever since.

782
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:18,034
It's hard to say, he's had
a lot of episodes lately.

783
01:21:18,192 --> 01:21:19,298
When did he disappear?

784
01:21:19,398 --> 01:21:20,240
Yesterday.

785
01:21:20,948 --> 01:21:23,416
And who... you
reported him missing?

786
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:26,653
We always wait 24 hours, sir.
Hospital policy.

787
01:21:29,356 --> 01:21:31,409
Can't say there's another
bit of imagination, hah?

788
01:21:32,962 --> 01:21:35,664
I can take him now, unless of course,
you want to keep him for the night.

789
01:21:36,154 --> 01:21:37,876
No, no. Thanks.

790
01:21:38,287 --> 01:21:40,128
You take him with you.

791
01:22:30,442 --> 01:22:31,675
Thank you for your help.

792
01:22:31,847 --> 01:22:33,681
Yeah, good luck.
Be careful.

793
01:22:45,289 --> 01:22:46,537
No, I'm on the way now.

794
01:22:47,501 --> 01:22:48,808
What are you wearing?

795
01:22:54,731 --> 01:22:55,914
No, why?

796
01:22:57,816 --> 01:22:58,758
Nothing.

797
01:24:01,662 --> 01:24:03,995
His vital signs are stable, Dr. Adams.

798
01:24:06,066 --> 01:24:07,870
Thank you, that'll be all.

799
01:24:20,568 --> 01:24:22,549
I'm quite upset
with you, Raymond.

800
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:29,211
Going to the press, that was
not part of our arrangement.

801
01:24:29,407 --> 01:24:31,250
I'm sorry.

802
01:24:32,595 --> 01:24:35,909
That's ok.
Everything is fine now.

803
01:24:40,618 --> 01:24:42,066
You are a genius.

804
01:24:44,594 --> 01:24:48,523
Living and touching
real human chaos.

805
01:24:49,613 --> 01:24:52,259
It was the greatest
experience of my life.

806
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:59,401
It was beautiful.

807
01:25:07,125 --> 01:25:08,909
You get some sleep.

808
01:26:04,725 --> 01:26:06,273
You don't control him anymore.

809
01:26:08,503 --> 01:26:10,127
He controls you.

810
01:26:12,117 --> 01:26:14,735
Kill him, and come home.

811
01:26:20,545 --> 01:26:21,691
I love you.

812
01:26:32,109 --> 01:26:36,280
