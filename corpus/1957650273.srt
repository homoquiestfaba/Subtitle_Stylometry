00:00:11,988 --> 00:00:13,788
[Dispatch Woman]
Dispatch to 44.

3
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,259
[Dispatch Man] 44, go ahead.

4
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:18,660
[Dispatch Woman] Respond to
the 400 block of early road,

5
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,963
report of a crash
involving a motorcycle.

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,066
[Dispatch Man]
44 copy, on my way.

7
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:28,070
[tense music]

8
00:00:28,137 --> 00:00:30,805
[siren ringing]

9
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:36,078
[engine revving]

10
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:40,016
[Jonathan] When you
experience death like I have,

11
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,851
you see that God's not there.

12
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,521
[tense music]

13
00:00:53,528 --> 00:00:56,165
[siren ringing]

14
00:01:04,706 --> 00:01:07,709
[emotional music]

15
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:43,478
Tell me, pastor,

16
00:01:44,713 --> 00:01:47,183
why does God let bad things
happen to good people?

17
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:51,553
Why is God silent?

18
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,025
Do you really think that God,

19
00:01:56,892 --> 00:01:58,593
the creator of heaven and Earth,

20
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,163
and everything in it is silent?

21
00:02:08,703 --> 00:02:13,175
You really think he's just
ignoring all of us down here?

22
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,480
Maybe he's talking, Jonathan,

23
00:02:17,545 --> 00:02:19,248
and you're just not listening.

24
00:02:22,118 --> 00:02:25,221
I wonder what you'd say if
you saw the things I've seen.

25
00:02:26,222 --> 00:02:29,158
[melancholy music]

26
00:02:31,427 --> 00:02:33,362
My dad was my best friend,

27
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:36,265
and my best memories of
him were on that lake,

28
00:02:36,332 --> 00:02:38,134
doing what we loved.

29
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:41,603
Yeah?

30
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:43,439
[water splashing]

31
00:02:43,506 --> 00:02:46,841
You know, I remember one time
we went deep sea fishing,

32
00:02:47,842 --> 00:02:51,013
and I put a bass line
looking for sea bass.

33
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,116
All of a sudden, my
line just took off.

34
00:02:54,183 --> 00:02:55,885
Something big got it.

35
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:59,922
I finally pull him up to
the top and it was huge,

36
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:02,525
and the three of us pulled
that thing up over the side,

37
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,826
and got it on the
deck of the boat.

38
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:07,829
It was 105 pounds.

39
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:10,366
It was five foot long.

40
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:11,733
Five foot?

41
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,437
So what do you think,
for your next birthday,

42
00:03:14,503 --> 00:03:17,006
if we take you deep sea fishing?

43
00:03:18,307 --> 00:03:19,341
[Jonathan] For real?

44
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:20,608
For real.

45
00:03:20,675 --> 00:03:22,677
Wow, that's pretty cool.

46
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,778
[laughing]

47
00:03:23,845 --> 00:03:24,880
I can't think of a better way

48
00:03:24,947 --> 00:03:26,515
to celebrate your next birthday

49
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,317
than to take you
deep sea fishing.

50
00:03:29,218 --> 00:03:31,921
[Jonathan] I didn't
realize it then,

51
00:03:31,987 --> 00:03:34,323
but that was my last
good memory of my dad.

52
00:03:38,127 --> 00:03:40,695
I can remember the
day she told us.

53
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:43,865
As a kid you never
fully understand.

54
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:47,169
Daddy's really sick,

55
00:03:50,872 --> 00:03:54,910
and Jesus is going to
take him to heaven soon.

56
00:03:58,214 --> 00:04:01,050
[emotional music]

57
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:13,462
[whispering] You're going
to be okay, I promise.

58
00:04:13,529 --> 00:04:15,898
[sobbing]

59
00:04:16,698 --> 00:04:17,732
I promise.

60
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:28,344
We are going to be okay.

61
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:36,684
Hi, Jonathan.

62
00:04:38,354 --> 00:04:39,188
Come in.

63
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,157
Come in.

64
00:04:46,095 --> 00:04:48,830
You'll be the man
of the house soon.

65
00:04:49,797 --> 00:04:53,169
Mom's gonna need you
to be strong, okay?

66
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:56,405
Who's going to take
me fishing in the ocean?

67
00:04:56,472 --> 00:04:57,839
Sorry, Jonathan.

68
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:02,011
I won't be able to
take you to the ocean.

69
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:05,314
It's almost my time, I'm sorry.

70
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,084
No.

71
00:05:11,654 --> 00:05:14,456
[Jonathan] I still regret not
spending more time with him.

72
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,393
I regret not
talking to him more.

73
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:22,164
[Mom] No! [crying]

74
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,366
Come on.

75
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:25,467
No, no.

76
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,337
[sobbing]

77
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:30,872
No, no,
no.

78
00:05:36,412 --> 00:05:37,646
[Jonathan] That was the day

79
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,814
I realized God
didn't care about me.

80
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:42,451
God didn't care about any of us.

81
00:05:43,452 --> 00:05:46,288
Even if he was real, why
wouldn't he listen to a child?

82
00:05:48,424 --> 00:05:51,393
[dramatic music]

83
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,847
[Dad] Sorry, Jonathan.

84
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,885
I won't be able to
take you to the ocean.

85
00:06:18,988 --> 00:06:21,856
You'll be man of the house soon.

86
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:25,928
Mom's going to need
you to be strong, okay?

87
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,271
[Mom] Hey!

88
00:06:38,474 --> 00:06:39,541
Jonathan?

89
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,343
Why did daddy die?

90
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,378
We prayed for him.

91
00:06:43,212 --> 00:06:44,647
Who's gonna take care of you?

92
00:06:44,713 --> 00:06:48,917
Who's going to take care of me?

93
00:06:48,984 --> 00:06:50,785
I'm sorry, son.

94
00:06:52,554 --> 00:06:53,855
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:53,922 --> 00:06:56,492
[Jonathan] You're not,
you don't understand.

96
00:06:56,558 --> 00:06:57,626
[Mom] Jonathan, wait.

97
00:06:57,693 --> 00:06:59,228
Please, [yelling] Jonathan.

98
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:01,063
Jonathan!

99
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:08,037
Eight years later, I was
training to become an officer.

100
00:07:08,904 --> 00:07:10,372
Let's go, Jonathan move it.

101
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,273
Come on.

102
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,474
Come on, get them out of there.

103
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,375
Come on, move it.

104
00:07:14,677 --> 00:07:16,245
[gun blasting]

105
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:17,713
Jonathan, why do you
want to be a cop?

106
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,381
I want to make
a difference, sir.

107
00:07:19,448 --> 00:07:21,984
[gun blasting]

108
00:07:22,051 --> 00:07:24,553
[tense music]

109
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,458
Get back, get back.

110
00:07:30,592 --> 00:07:31,560
Get back!

111
00:07:31,627 --> 00:07:32,928
Fire.

112
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:35,597
[gun blasting]

113
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:41,836
I want to protect
and serve, sir.

114
00:07:41,904 --> 00:07:43,605
I want to be a better man, sir.

115
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:46,608
We'll see about that.

116
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,577
Put your hands on the ground.

117
00:07:49,712 --> 00:07:51,146
Welcome to the force.

118
00:07:51,213 --> 00:07:53,282
Congratulations, Hickory.

119
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:54,550
You made it.

120
00:07:54,616 --> 00:07:55,584
- Thank you, sir.
- Proud of you.

121
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,923
[upbeat music]

122
00:08:09,398 --> 00:08:12,101
[engine revving]

123
00:08:38,627 --> 00:08:40,362
- Hey!
- Hey.

124
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,331
How did it go?

125
00:08:43,432 --> 00:08:45,534
I don't think
I did that great.

126
00:08:46,535 --> 00:08:48,937
I'm sure you did better
than what you think, right?

127
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:50,038
Yeah.

128
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:53,075
Well, listen.

129
00:08:53,142 --> 00:08:54,209
You're smart.

130
00:08:55,344 --> 00:08:56,712
You know what you're doing.

131
00:08:57,846 --> 00:09:01,817
I'm sure you're going to figure
out a way to get in there,

132
00:09:01,885 --> 00:09:02,918
right?

133
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:04,553
Yeah.

134
00:09:05,854 --> 00:09:07,089
I guess that's
why you're looking

135
00:09:07,156 --> 00:09:09,658
at the new Officer Hickory.

136
00:09:09,725 --> 00:09:10,559
No?

137
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,395
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah?

138
00:09:13,462 --> 00:09:14,296
Oh yeah!

139
00:09:14,363 --> 00:09:16,298
[giggling]

140
00:09:16,365 --> 00:09:18,500
I'm so happy for you!

141
00:09:19,968 --> 00:09:21,370
Put this on, strap up.

142
00:09:26,475 --> 00:09:27,443
Ready?

143
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:30,279
[engine revving]

144
00:09:31,146 --> 00:09:34,183
[emotional music]

145
00:09:42,024 --> 00:09:43,325
Stacy, did I ever
tell you the story

146
00:09:43,392 --> 00:09:45,527
of the most beautiful
girl in the world?

147
00:09:45,594 --> 00:09:46,428
No.

148
00:09:47,897 --> 00:09:48,831
Once upon a time,

149
00:09:48,898 --> 00:09:50,332
there was a girl so beautiful

150
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,135
she lit up every
room she walked into.

151
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:58,273
She was confident,
with piercing bluish,

152
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:02,511
greenish eyes that
always changed colors,

153
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:06,281
and radiant blonde hair that
shined like the morning sun.

154
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,218
Now you might be wondering
whatever happened

155
00:10:09,284 --> 00:10:10,385
to the most beautiful
girl in the world?

156
00:10:10,452 --> 00:10:13,755
Well, she met some lucky chump,

157
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,357
gave him her number on a napkin

158
00:10:15,424 --> 00:10:20,529
with a note that
said don't lose this.

159
00:10:26,735 --> 00:10:27,569
I didn't.

160
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,080
Stacy Evangeline.

161
00:10:39,581 --> 00:10:42,618
They say in life we only
fall in love three times,

162
00:10:43,652 --> 00:10:48,423
but I've been falling in
love with you 365 days a year

163
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,726
for the last three
years of my life.

164
00:10:51,593 --> 00:10:56,765
And if you promise
not to lose this,

165
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:01,703
I plan on falling in
love with you over,

166
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,338
and over, and over again,

167
00:11:03,405 --> 00:11:05,140
for the rest of my life.

168
00:11:07,476 --> 00:11:10,612
So will the most beautiful
girl in the world marry me?

169
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,015
[grunting]

170
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,516
[giggling]

171
00:11:15,484 --> 00:11:17,719
[cheering]

172
00:11:29,598 --> 00:11:32,367
I wish your father were here.

173
00:11:33,036 --> 00:11:33,903
Yeah, me too.

174
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,837
He's be so proud of you.

175
00:11:36,973 --> 00:11:39,608
Oh, I love you my son.

176
00:11:39,675 --> 00:11:40,709
I love you, mom.

177
00:11:40,776 --> 00:11:43,812
- Oh, I know that!
- I know you do.

178
00:11:45,882 --> 00:11:47,416
I'm so happy for you.

179
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:50,419
Oh, mom.

180
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,591
Bye mom.

181
00:11:57,826 --> 00:12:01,129
[emotional piano music]

182
00:12:10,974 --> 00:12:13,809
Stacy was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

183
00:12:15,979 --> 00:12:17,779
She's the reason I'm here today.

184
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:22,618
She's the love of my life.

185
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:29,124
I really don't deserve her.

186
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:33,228
She sounds like
an amazing woman.

187
00:12:34,696 --> 00:12:35,564
She is.

188
00:12:36,531 --> 00:12:38,734
What happened to
that happy couple?

189
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:41,837
When did things go wrong?

190
00:12:45,874 --> 00:12:48,477
[Team] On my honor, I
will never betray my badge,

191
00:12:48,543 --> 00:12:50,145
my integrity, my character,

192
00:12:50,212 --> 00:12:51,613
or the public trust.

193
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,715
I will always have the
courage to hold myself

194
00:12:53,782 --> 00:12:55,617
and others accountable
for our actions.

195
00:12:55,684 --> 00:12:57,819
I will also hold
the constitution,

196
00:12:57,887 --> 00:13:00,222
the community, and
the agency I serve,

197
00:13:00,288 --> 00:13:01,323
So help me, God.

198
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,810
[Steve] Officer Hickory?

199
00:13:21,878 --> 00:13:22,711
Yes, sir.

200
00:13:24,246 --> 00:13:26,248
Steve Watson, field
training officer.

201
00:13:26,314 --> 00:13:27,282
Nice to meet you.

202
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:28,784
- You ready?
- Yeah.

203
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,886
Let's go.

204
00:13:33,555 --> 00:13:34,823
So I read your file.

205
00:13:34,891 --> 00:13:36,792
Looks like you were
top of your class,

206
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:37,894
but trust me,

207
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,162
there is no training that could

208
00:13:39,261 --> 00:13:40,696
prepare you for the streets.

209
00:13:40,762 --> 00:13:44,599
Look, I know you just got
married and you're all excited.

210
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,834
I get it.

211
00:13:45,902 --> 00:13:47,869
But you got to get your
head out of the clouds, son.

212
00:13:47,937 --> 00:13:49,871
These streets are tough.

213
00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:51,473
If you aren't sharp and focused,

214
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,808
these streets will
eat you alive,

215
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,743
and it will get you
killed, do you understand?

216
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:55,644
Yes, sir.

217
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:56,913
Look, I'm here to learn.

218
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:58,014
You won't have to
worry about me.

219
00:13:58,081 --> 00:13:59,481
Let's get this straight.

220
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,884
I run a tight ship.

221
00:14:01,951 --> 00:14:03,119
We do it by the book.

222
00:14:03,186 --> 00:14:04,419
If you want to
get trained by me,

223
00:14:04,486 --> 00:14:07,222
you do what I say,
when I say it.

224
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:09,758
If you hesitate, it
could cost you your life.

225
00:14:11,194 --> 00:14:12,694
Now fix your collar.

226
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:14,897
You're a professional and
you need to look like one.

227
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,365
Bet you're fun at parties.

228
00:14:17,432 --> 00:14:18,867
No, I am not fun.

229
00:14:18,935 --> 00:14:19,902
Now get in the car.

230
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:27,509
So are we getting
some donuts or what?

231
00:14:29,845 --> 00:14:30,947
New rule.

232
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:33,548
You have something
stupid to say, don't.

233
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:36,886
Yes sir.

234
00:14:36,953 --> 00:14:39,287
[Dispatch Woman]
Dispatch to Unit 71.

235
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:40,322
This us?

236
00:14:40,388 --> 00:14:41,891
71, go ahead.

237
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,359
[Dispatch Woman] Respond to
the area of ridge salvage yard

238
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,762
in the 900 block of Thurman Road

239
00:14:46,828 --> 00:14:48,263
for the reports of shots fired.

240
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,298
A caller stated
at least two males

241
00:14:50,365 --> 00:14:51,800
armed with assault rifles,

242
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:54,870
multiple shots heard,
no further description.

243
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:05,014
In the 71, on location.

244
00:15:05,081 --> 00:15:05,814
This is it, huh?

245
00:15:05,882 --> 00:15:06,815
So what's the plan.

246
00:15:06,883 --> 00:15:08,151
Keep your head on a swivel.

247
00:15:08,217 --> 00:15:09,384
We don't know what
we're walking into.

248
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,685
Here's your pack and tourniquet.

249
00:15:10,752 --> 00:15:11,586
What?

250
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:18,928
[tense music]

251
00:15:21,264 --> 00:15:23,933
[guns blasting]

252
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:26,936
[Steve] Base, shots fired.

253
00:15:27,003 --> 00:15:29,906
Hope they showed you
how to use that thing.

254
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:32,474
[tense music]

255
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:46,956
Right, we got to go.

256
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,996
[Jonathan] I'm gonna
check this corner.

257
00:16:17,286 --> 00:16:20,156
[gun blasting]

258
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,389
Hear that?

259
00:16:21,456 --> 00:16:22,824
[Steve] Mhm.

260
00:16:23,758 --> 00:16:25,294
[Jonathan] That's them.

261
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,063
[Steve] Yep.

262
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:28,931
[Jonathan] All right,
I'm gonna move on.

263
00:16:28,998 --> 00:16:30,665
[Steve] I got you.

264
00:16:32,235 --> 00:16:35,104
[guns blasting]

265
00:16:35,171 --> 00:16:37,505
[yelling] Police,
put your gun down now!

266
00:16:37,572 --> 00:16:38,807
Put your gun down!

267
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:42,044
I will shoot, put
your gun down now.

268
00:16:42,111 --> 00:16:43,678
Put your gun down now.

269
00:16:43,745 --> 00:16:44,981
Now!

270
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:47,749
[tense music]

271
00:17:09,638 --> 00:17:10,872
I almost shot him.

272
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,774
I know.

273
00:17:12,841 --> 00:17:16,078
- I almost shot him.
- I know, but you didn't.

274
00:17:16,145 --> 00:17:16,979
You know why?

275
00:17:17,046 --> 00:17:18,381
You used your brain.

276
00:17:18,446 --> 00:17:19,982
Good instincts, son.

277
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:22,051
Good instincts, come on.

278
00:17:26,454 --> 00:17:29,158
[tense music]

279
00:17:29,225 --> 00:17:32,161
[distant chatting]

280
00:17:36,198 --> 00:17:37,166
[Jonathan] Police, freeze.

281
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:38,067
Get on the ground now!

282
00:17:38,134 --> 00:17:39,302
What's going on?

283
00:17:40,002 --> 00:17:41,337
[Jonathan] All of
you on the ground now,

284
00:17:41,404 --> 00:17:42,939
hands where I can see them.

285
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:51,446
Officer, I got a couple cold
ones if you just let me go.

286
00:17:51,513 --> 00:17:53,049
I don't drink on the job, man.

287
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,150
Come on, watch your head.

288
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:01,723
[sighing]

289
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,025
Hey, hey,
hey.

290
00:18:03,092 --> 00:18:05,094
You did a good job
today, all right?

291
00:18:06,594 --> 00:18:07,595
Thanks.

292
00:18:10,032 --> 00:18:12,902
[phone buzzing]

293
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:13,601
Hi!

294
00:18:13,668 --> 00:18:14,904
Hey baby, how are you?

295
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:17,505
[Stacy] I'm good, I'm
just grading papers.

296
00:18:17,572 --> 00:18:18,506
Yeah?

297
00:18:18,573 --> 00:18:20,176
[Stacy] Is everything okay?

298
00:18:20,242 --> 00:18:21,877
Yeah, everything's going fine.

299
00:18:22,744 --> 00:18:26,048
It's a slow night,
pretty boring actually.

300
00:18:26,848 --> 00:18:28,217
Well, I miss you.

301
00:18:28,284 --> 00:18:29,218
I miss you too.

302
00:18:30,186 --> 00:18:32,221
I just wanted to call
and hear your voice,

303
00:18:32,288 --> 00:18:33,688
and tell you I love you.

304
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:35,958
I love you too.

305
00:18:39,095 --> 00:18:40,396
Yeah.

306
00:18:40,463 --> 00:18:42,398
Well look, I got to go,

307
00:18:42,465 --> 00:18:44,166
so don't wait up for me, okay?

308
00:18:46,768 --> 00:18:48,104
Good night, I love you.

309
00:18:49,537 --> 00:18:52,640
[distant chatting]

310
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:54,776
Sorry about that.

311
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,611
Hey man, it's all right.

312
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:59,949
Listen, you did the
right thing over there.

313
00:19:00,016 --> 00:19:02,751
We don't need to bring
this world into our homes.

314
00:19:02,817 --> 00:19:04,887
Our families don't need to
know what's going on out here.

315
00:19:04,954 --> 00:19:06,956
[Dispatch Woman] Any available
unit respond to code three,

316
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:08,157
the Shinston Road
on the interstate...

317
00:19:08,224 --> 00:19:08,991
Let's go.

318
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:10,558
[alarm blaring]

319
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,128
[Dispatch Woman] With the
report of a motor vehicle crash,

320
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:13,628
with entrapment and injury.

321
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:16,198
Report of a vehicle down
on embankment on it's side.

322
00:19:16,265 --> 00:19:17,766
Witnesses reporting
vehicles appeared

323
00:19:17,832 --> 00:19:19,301
to be racing before the crash.

324
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:24,806
Unknown if any other vehicles
were involved at this time.

325
00:19:25,307 --> 00:19:27,943
[thunder rumbling]

326
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:32,580
[Steve] Check that
vehicle, I'll check this one.

327
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:35,084
[grunting]

328
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:38,287
[eerie music]

329
00:19:38,354 --> 00:19:39,388
Dispatch, this looks serious.

330
00:19:39,455 --> 00:19:40,990
11 80, put a rush on that body.

331
00:19:41,057 --> 00:19:41,589
Hey, Police,

332
00:19:41,656 --> 00:19:42,857
stay right there.

333
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:45,660
[Dispatch Woman]
10 for Unit 44.

334
00:19:59,341 --> 00:20:00,176
Sydney.

335
00:20:02,278 --> 00:20:03,179
She was 16.

336
00:20:05,214 --> 00:20:07,615
Sydney would never
get to fall in love.

337
00:20:09,285 --> 00:20:10,685
She would never get married,

338
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,355
never experience motherhood.

339
00:20:14,656 --> 00:20:17,259
All her hopes, dreams,

340
00:20:18,227 --> 00:20:19,195
gone.

341
00:20:20,463 --> 00:20:23,598
Her entire life
flashed before my eyes.

342
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:31,340
[haunting music]

343
00:20:53,828 --> 00:20:56,031
You doing all right?

344
00:20:56,098 --> 00:21:01,170
I've never seen someone
dead like that before.

345
00:21:03,572 --> 00:21:06,308
Look, police work isn't easy.

346
00:21:08,077 --> 00:21:10,946
You see a lot of crazy
things out there.

347
00:21:12,214 --> 00:21:14,917
Let me tell you
something, off the record.

348
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:18,686
I found one thing that helps
me get through all of this.

349
00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:20,956
What's that?

350
00:21:21,924 --> 00:21:24,293
Couldn't do this
job without Jesus.

351
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,828
- Really?
- Yeah.

352
00:21:26,896 --> 00:21:28,397
Here, take this.

353
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,700
That's our church.

354
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:36,305
You should stop by some time.

355
00:21:37,705 --> 00:21:39,408
Come on, let's go.

356
00:21:54,223 --> 00:21:56,058
[Jonathan] Death
notifications.

357
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,762
This is the hardest
part of my job.

358
00:22:04,732 --> 00:22:06,068
They have no idea, huh?

359
00:22:08,571 --> 00:22:10,172
No idea whatsoever.

360
00:22:12,474 --> 00:22:15,377
[chanting quietly]

361
00:22:17,012 --> 00:22:18,347
What are you doing?

362
00:22:20,349 --> 00:22:21,350
Reading the Bible.

363
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,354
Why?

364
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,125
Because it helps me.

365
00:22:32,528 --> 00:22:34,496
[sighing]

366
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:41,937
[Jonathan] How do you tell
a mother her child just died?

367
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:45,908
[woman sobbing]

368
00:22:59,255 --> 00:23:01,789
[woman crying]

369
00:23:04,893 --> 00:23:05,961
No, no,
no.

370
00:23:07,997 --> 00:23:10,466
[eerie music]

371
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,485
[slow rock music]

372
00:23:29,551 --> 00:23:32,388
[Thomas] Hey rook,
here's a drink for you.

373
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:33,522
Who are you?

374
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:34,490
I'm Thomas.

375
00:23:34,556 --> 00:23:35,724
Jonathan, nice to meet you.

376
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,259
- Good to meet you.
- Thank you.

377
00:23:37,326 --> 00:23:41,597
I heard you ran into some
West Virginia's finest today?

378
00:23:42,264 --> 00:23:44,233
Yeah, that's
one way to put it.

379
00:23:46,335 --> 00:23:48,671
I don't know how you
guys do this, man.

380
00:23:48,737 --> 00:23:49,938
Hey, look kid.

381
00:23:50,005 --> 00:23:52,241
After a while you
get used to it.

382
00:23:52,308 --> 00:23:54,176
Yeah, some days
you're out there

383
00:23:54,243 --> 00:23:56,378
doing paperwork for eight hours,

384
00:23:56,445 --> 00:23:58,614
and the next day
you're getting shot at.

385
00:23:58,681 --> 00:24:00,416
[laughing]

386
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:01,550
Where's Watson.

387
00:24:01,617 --> 00:24:03,452
Oh, guys a square.

388
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:04,553
Doesn't drink at all.

389
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,121
He'll never step foot in here.

390
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,492
[Thomas] We heard
about the girl.

391
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,593
How are you handling that?

392
00:24:15,698 --> 00:24:17,032
I mean, I've never experienced

393
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:19,201
something like that
before in my life.

394
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:21,804
It is what it is.

395
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:22,938
Hey guys, to the rookie.

396
00:24:23,706 --> 00:24:25,007
[Thomas] To the rookie.

397
00:24:25,074 --> 00:24:26,508
[Rodriguez] Get
that glass up to here.

398
00:24:26,575 --> 00:24:27,443
[Thomas] To the rookie.

399
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:28,544
Thank you.

400
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:35,984
It'll get easier.

401
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:40,222
Sooner or later, you
won't feel a thing.

402
00:24:44,093 --> 00:24:46,061
[Jonathan] You
have a good night.

403
00:24:46,995 --> 00:24:48,597
You be safe,
thanks for riding.

404
00:24:49,631 --> 00:24:51,866
[groaning]

405
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:03,278
[sighing]

406
00:25:07,616 --> 00:25:08,550
[Stacy] Hi.

407
00:25:08,617 --> 00:25:09,585
Hey.

408
00:25:09,651 --> 00:25:10,986
Oh, you stink.

409
00:25:12,521 --> 00:25:14,022
Mm, where have you been?

410
00:25:15,991 --> 00:25:17,259
Few of the guys,

411
00:25:17,326 --> 00:25:19,995
they wanted to celebrate
the rookies first day.

412
00:25:21,096 --> 00:25:22,197
Couldn't say no.

413
00:25:23,098 --> 00:25:24,666
So how was the
rookie's first day?

414
00:25:27,503 --> 00:25:29,671
[sobbing]

415
00:25:38,847 --> 00:25:40,649
It was different.

416
00:25:43,652 --> 00:25:47,122
My FTI was a nice guy, I met
him for the first time today.

417
00:25:48,724 --> 00:25:50,359
We got donuts and joked around.

418
00:25:54,329 --> 00:25:55,164
Good.

419
00:25:56,365 --> 00:25:57,499
Now go get some rest,

420
00:25:57,566 --> 00:25:59,201
I'll catch up with you, okay?

421
00:26:03,071 --> 00:26:03,972
I love you.

422
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:06,575
[Jonathan] I love you too.

423
00:26:16,051 --> 00:26:18,420
[sighing]

424
00:26:19,988 --> 00:26:22,658
[woman sobbing]

425
00:26:27,729 --> 00:26:30,432
[tense music]

426
00:26:32,601 --> 00:26:35,204
[woman crying]

427
00:27:14,878 --> 00:27:17,746
[woman sobbing]

428
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,652
[Mom] No, no,
no.

429
00:27:34,931 --> 00:27:36,131
Thank you.

430
00:27:41,503 --> 00:27:45,073
Can y'all help me
pray for my husband?

431
00:27:46,108 --> 00:27:49,177
[emotional music]

432
00:27:50,078 --> 00:27:52,748
The Lord, Jonathan
is a good man,

433
00:27:53,649 --> 00:27:56,618
but I think this job is
more than he expected.

434
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,522
I think that he sees things

435
00:28:01,657 --> 00:28:04,059
that he can't talk
to anybody about.

436
00:28:07,095 --> 00:28:11,066
I sense that it's hurting him.

437
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,536
It's changing him.

438
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,141
I feel like he's
feeling hopeless,

439
00:28:20,175 --> 00:28:21,777
and he needs you, God.

440
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:29,785
I know that God can help him,

441
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:35,290
and that through
the power of Jesus,

442
00:28:35,357 --> 00:28:37,092
that I can get my husband back.

443
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:45,133
Amen.

444
00:28:48,704 --> 00:28:51,373
[door knocking]

445
00:28:52,174 --> 00:28:53,709
Hey Jonathan, come on in.

446
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:54,676
[Jonathan] Lieutenant.

447
00:28:54,743 --> 00:28:55,979
It's good to see you.

448
00:28:56,045 --> 00:28:57,080
[Jonathan] It's
great to see you.

449
00:28:57,145 --> 00:28:58,180
Please have a seat.

450
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:01,183
So I've been
talking to your FTO,

451
00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:03,452
and he tells me you
have some talent.

452
00:29:03,518 --> 00:29:04,853
Just doing my job, sir.

453
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:06,355
Well, that's
certainly good to hear.

454
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:08,357
Apparently you're
doing it really well.

455
00:29:08,423 --> 00:29:10,525
We're thinking
about moving you up.

456
00:29:10,592 --> 00:29:12,294
How you feel about the
traffic safety end?

457
00:29:12,361 --> 00:29:13,328
You pulling my leg?

458
00:29:13,395 --> 00:29:14,696
No, I am not.

459
00:29:14,763 --> 00:29:18,300
As part of that, you get a
motorcycle and an unmarked car.

460
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:19,701
Congratulations, son.

461
00:29:21,603 --> 00:29:22,838
Wow, this,

462
00:29:23,872 --> 00:29:25,374
it's an honor, sir.

463
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,341
Thank you so much.

464
00:29:26,408 --> 00:29:27,142
Well, you know what?

465
00:29:27,209 --> 00:29:28,143
You've earned it.

466
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,211
Just don't make me regret it.

467
00:29:29,277 --> 00:29:30,312
[Jonathan] I'll do my best...

468
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:31,580
All right.

469
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:32,314
[whistling]

470
00:29:32,381 --> 00:29:34,349
Look at that, nice.

471
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:35,717
Yeah, and we can afford that,

472
00:29:35,784 --> 00:29:37,987
but they can't upgrade
my crappy cruiser.

473
00:29:38,054 --> 00:29:39,421
I know, kills me.

474
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:41,723
Wow, who's the lucky chump?

475
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,858
No idea.

476
00:29:42,925 --> 00:29:44,593
Certainly isn't you, Hickory.

477
00:29:47,863 --> 00:29:50,099
[Thomas] Oh, no way.

478
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:51,767
There's no way on God's green

479
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,403
earth they're
entrusting that to you.

480
00:29:57,339 --> 00:29:59,474
Hey, were you able to
find a big enough helmet

481
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:00,542
to go over that head of yours?

482
00:30:00,609 --> 00:30:02,045
Don't be mad they don't make

483
00:30:02,111 --> 00:30:04,780
these for senior
citizens, Rodriguez.

484
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:06,248
Oh, that's cold dude.

485
00:30:06,314 --> 00:30:07,349
What was that?

486
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:08,918
[Rodriguez] That is cold, bro.

487
00:30:08,985 --> 00:30:10,185
That's cold.

488
00:30:10,252 --> 00:30:11,853
One more time,
I can't hear you?

489
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:13,655
That's cold, bro.

490
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,759
Man, I can't believe
he's got that ride.

491
00:30:17,826 --> 00:30:19,194
[Thomas] I know.

492
00:30:19,261 --> 00:30:21,730
[engine revving]

493
00:30:21,797 --> 00:30:23,066
[Dispatch Woman]
Dispatch to Unit 44.

494
00:30:23,132 --> 00:30:24,633
[Jonathan] 44, go ahead.

495
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,601
[Dispatch Woman] 44 respond
code three to the intersection

496
00:30:26,668 --> 00:30:28,670
of Second Street
and Maple Avenue.

497
00:30:28,737 --> 00:30:30,973
We have report of a
single vehicle overturned,

498
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,143
multiple occupants, possibly
children in the vehicle,

499
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:35,243
unknown injury.

500
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,778
Fire and rescue are responding.

501
00:30:36,845 --> 00:30:39,015

[quiet rock music]

504
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,838
[Rodriguez] That bad, huh?

505
00:32:13,209 --> 00:32:14,409
Whole family.

506
00:32:18,047 --> 00:32:19,048
It was horrible.

507
00:32:25,021 --> 00:32:26,956
[Rodriguez] What
can I say, kid?

508
00:32:27,023 --> 00:32:29,959
It's part of the job.

509
00:32:31,994 --> 00:32:32,995
Someone's got to do it.

510
00:33:14,971 --> 00:33:17,907

514
00:35:07,183 --> 00:35:08,217
Jonathan?

Hey, kid.

520
00:36:42,811 --> 00:36:44,280
Mrs Hickory, where is she?

521
00:36:44,346 --> 00:36:45,680
Excuse me, is everything okay?

522
00:36:45,747 --> 00:36:47,349
Yeah, I'm just
looking for my wife.

523
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:49,552
Oh, third door on the left.

524
00:36:49,617 --> 00:36:50,685
Hey, walking feet!

525
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:53,189
Are you okay, sweetie?

526
00:36:53,255 --> 00:36:55,757
So, can anybody
tell me what this is?

527
00:36:55,824 --> 00:36:56,591
[Class] [inaudible]

528
00:36:56,658 --> 00:36:57,826
Good job.

529
00:36:58,626 --> 00:37:00,296
And how about this?

530
00:37:00,362 --> 00:37:01,263
[Class] Funnel.

531
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,764
[Stacy] Funnel, good job.

532
00:37:02,831 --> 00:37:04,699

[gasping]

534
00:37:06,868 --> 00:37:07,769
We're having a baby?

535

We're having a baby?

[students cheering]

537
00:37:12,308 --> 00:37:13,775

[students cheering]

539
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:25,888
Look what we
made, she's perfect.

540
00:37:29,425 --> 00:37:30,960
Let her sleep.

Okay, all right.

546

You got her?

547
00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:01,310
And you know her sleep schedule,

548
00:40:02,511 --> 00:40:05,114
and you know she gets
fed in 20 minutes, right?

549
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,149
Mhm.

550
00:40:07,216 --> 00:40:08,783
Are you sure you need me?

551
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:09,784
[whispers] No, we're fine.

552
00:40:09,851 --> 00:40:10,886
You sure?

553
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,820
Okay.

554
00:40:12,888 --> 00:40:13,989
And you're going
to call me, right?

555
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:15,758
Yeah.

556
00:40:15,823 --> 00:40:17,293
[Stacy] Okay.

557
00:40:30,506 --> 00:40:32,708
[tense music]

558
00:40:32,775 --> 00:40:35,444
[baby Ana crying]

559
00:40:35,511 --> 00:40:36,545
Shh.

560
00:40:38,247 --> 00:40:39,081
Shh.

561
00:40:46,422 --> 00:40:48,924
[tense music]

562
00:41:17,619 --> 00:41:20,522
[glasses rattling]

563
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,905
[sniffing]

564
00:41:36,972 --> 00:41:39,341
[sighing]

565
00:41:41,677 --> 00:41:44,580
[glasses clinking]

566
00:41:53,455 --> 00:41:55,924
[tense music]

567
00:42:40,135 --> 00:42:42,171
Drunk driving is
still the number one

568
00:42:42,237 --> 00:42:44,273
cause of death on our roadways.

569
00:42:45,107 --> 00:42:47,376
Two out of three
people will be impacted

570
00:42:47,443 --> 00:42:50,145
by a drunk driving
crash in their lifetime,

571
00:42:51,346 --> 00:42:54,116
which is why we take this
award very seriously.

572
00:42:54,183 --> 00:42:56,351
It is reserved for an officer,

573
00:42:56,418 --> 00:42:59,121
an exceptional
officer who has gone

574
00:42:59,188 --> 00:43:02,357
above and beyond to
keep our streets safe.

575
00:43:03,459 --> 00:43:05,294
He is a shining
example of someone

576
00:43:06,595 --> 00:43:09,731
who is making our
community a better place.

577
00:43:10,632 --> 00:43:13,802
It is my honor to
present this award

578
00:43:13,869 --> 00:43:16,738
to Officer Jonathan Hickory.

579
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:20,576
[audience clapping]

580
00:43:20,642 --> 00:43:21,677
Hey.

581
00:43:23,412 --> 00:43:26,114
Johnathan, you
reek of alcohol.

582
00:43:28,717 --> 00:43:32,020
[Kim] Thank you
for your service.

583
00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:34,423
Wow.

584
00:43:37,927 --> 00:43:39,094
Thank you everyone.

585
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:43,765
It is an honor and a pleasure
to stand here before you all.

586
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:46,268
Family comes first in our lives.

587
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:49,304
With another baby on the way,

588
00:43:49,371 --> 00:43:52,474
we know just how important it
is to keep our streets safe.

589
00:43:56,913 --> 00:44:01,783
I unfortunately know better

590
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:04,486
than most the horrific,

591
00:44:05,521 --> 00:44:07,756
tragic effects of drunk driving.

592
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:15,597
It's heartbreaking
to say the least.

593
00:44:20,335 --> 00:44:23,505
The effects of
drunk driving aren't

594
00:44:24,406 --> 00:44:27,776
just limited to
those in the impact,

595
00:44:29,845 --> 00:44:31,346
to our family members,

596
00:44:33,883 --> 00:44:34,716
our friends,

597
00:44:39,454 --> 00:44:40,289
our kids.

598
00:44:48,163 --> 00:44:49,197
Thank you.

599
00:44:51,935 --> 00:44:54,403
[clapping]

600
00:44:57,673 --> 00:44:59,675
[Dispatch Woman]
Dispatch to 44.

601
00:44:59,741 --> 00:45:01,209
[Jonathan] 44, go ahead.

602
00:45:01,276 --> 00:45:03,078
[Dispatch Woman] Respond to
the 400 block of Early Road,

603
00:45:03,145 --> 00:45:05,747
report of a crash
involving a motorcycle.

604
00:45:05,814 --> 00:45:06,715
[Jonathan] 44, copy.

605
00:45:06,782 --> 00:45:07,616
I'm on my way.

606
00:45:08,784 --> 00:45:11,620
[siren ringing]

607
00:45:19,561 --> 00:45:21,697
Hey, what have you got for me?

608
00:45:22,864 --> 00:45:24,766
Hey man, took you long enough.

609
00:45:24,833 --> 00:45:26,868
I actually do have
something for you.

610
00:45:27,836 --> 00:45:29,771
Here, it's his wallet.

611
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:31,074
Whose wallet?

612
00:45:31,139 --> 00:45:33,609
The guy on the
motorcycle, he's over there.

613
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,213
Oh, man.

614
00:45:39,815 --> 00:45:40,883
[Fireman] What?

615
00:45:42,718 --> 00:45:45,420
I know this guy, I went
to high school with him.

616
00:45:48,757 --> 00:45:50,826
Uh, where did you say?

617
00:45:51,593 --> 00:45:55,932
Right over there,
under that white sheet.

618
00:45:55,999 --> 00:45:58,767
[dramatic music]

619
00:46:02,137 --> 00:46:04,172
- Thanks.
- Sorry, bud.

620
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,944
[tense music]

621
00:47:25,154 --> 00:47:26,122
[yelling] Get out.

622
00:47:26,189 --> 00:47:27,123
Get out now.

623
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:28,223
Get out.

624
00:47:30,059 --> 00:47:33,129
Look at what you did,
look at what you did.

625
00:47:33,196 --> 00:47:34,997
He had a family, and a wife,

626
00:47:35,064 --> 00:47:36,832
and you killed him.

627
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:38,901
You killed him!

628
00:47:38,968 --> 00:47:40,235
You killed him.

629
00:47:41,037 --> 00:47:43,505
Look at this, look at this.

630
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,542
You killed him, you killed him.

631
00:47:57,954 --> 00:48:00,990
[emotional music]

632
00:49:00,849 --> 00:49:03,318
I couldn't understand
why they weren't angry.

633
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:06,555
I looked into the
eyes of that family

634
00:49:08,057 --> 00:49:09,791
and all I saw was sadness.

635
00:49:11,961 --> 00:49:12,895
Pure sadness.

636
00:49:12,962 --> 00:49:14,496
No anger, no resentment.

637
00:49:15,597 --> 00:49:17,332
They just missed their kid.

638
00:49:19,835 --> 00:49:22,671
They should be angry at
the drunk who killed him.

639
00:49:24,173 --> 00:49:25,473
They should hate him.

640
00:49:29,145 --> 00:49:30,679
But they couldn't.

641
00:49:30,745 --> 00:49:32,081
They were calm, and peaceful,

642
00:49:32,148 --> 00:49:34,050
and that infuriated me.

643
00:49:35,584 --> 00:49:37,019
He was this drunk who
just took the life

644
00:49:37,086 --> 00:49:41,123
of their loved one over some
stupid bottle of liqueur,

645
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:43,226
and they just forgave him.

646
00:49:43,292 --> 00:49:44,526
Just like that.

647
00:49:49,131 --> 00:49:50,732
If there's one thing I know,

648
00:49:53,002 --> 00:49:56,072
its that we're all gonna end
up dead with no hope anyway.

649
00:49:58,307 --> 00:50:00,009
What's the point in this life?

650
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:04,113
What difference does
it make, and who cares?

651
00:50:07,482 --> 00:50:08,683
I don't understand.

652
00:50:10,552 --> 00:50:12,487
Where was Jesus when
that guy swerved

653
00:50:12,554 --> 00:50:14,656
through three lanes
and killed Daniel?

654
00:50:16,524 --> 00:50:18,660
Jonathan, Jesus
didn't kill Daniel.

655
00:50:21,197 --> 00:50:22,731
Why don't you blame Satan?

656
00:50:23,632 --> 00:50:25,134
Oh God, come on Satan.

657
00:50:25,201 --> 00:50:27,970
Oh, so it's okay to
blame Jesus for everything,

658
00:50:28,037 --> 00:50:29,105
but not Satan?

659
00:50:30,106 --> 00:50:34,076
Not the one that the Bible
tells us comes to steal,

660
00:50:34,143 --> 00:50:35,577
kill, and destroy?

661
00:50:35,644 --> 00:50:36,913
He gets no credit?

662
00:50:37,846 --> 00:50:43,052
That family had peace
because they know Jesus.

663
00:50:45,487 --> 00:50:48,958
Because they know there's
more to this life.

664
00:50:50,893 --> 00:50:55,097
Because this life
is not perfect.

665
00:50:55,164 --> 00:50:56,032
It's broken.

666
00:50:57,199 --> 00:50:59,567
We broke it, sin broke it.

667
00:51:03,738 --> 00:51:06,875
I'm having a really
hard time buying that.

668
00:51:06,943 --> 00:51:08,077
If you got it all figured out,

669
00:51:08,144 --> 00:51:10,046
then what are we doing here?

670
00:51:10,112 --> 00:51:10,812
[Jonathan] I don't know.

671
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,281
Why did you want to talk?

672
00:51:12,348 --> 00:51:14,350
Do you want help?

673
00:51:14,417 --> 00:51:15,985
I'm trying to help you.

674
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:19,521
You wouldn't understand.

675
00:51:21,456 --> 00:51:23,558
Then make me understand.

676
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:30,132
It was Sunday, October 20th.

677
00:51:31,133 --> 00:51:32,201
[sighing]

678
00:51:32,268 --> 00:51:33,235
My wife was in her 20th week.

679
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,990
[screaming]

680
00:51:54,056 --> 00:51:54,856
Stacy?

681
00:51:56,058 --> 00:51:57,960
[Stacy] Make it
stop, it hurts.

682
00:51:58,027 --> 00:51:58,995
[Jonathan] Stacy,
are you okay?

683
00:51:59,061 --> 00:52:00,262
Stacy, open up.

684
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:02,131
Stacy passed the
baby, call 911.

685
00:52:04,967 --> 00:52:06,568
What do you mean
she passed the baby?

686
00:52:06,634 --> 00:52:08,070
Stacy passed the baby.

687
00:52:08,137 --> 00:52:10,605
Go Jonathan, call 911.

688
00:52:10,672 --> 00:52:13,541
[distant crying]

689
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,714
My wife is 20 weeks pregnant,

690
00:52:20,515 --> 00:52:23,119
and she just,

691
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:25,254
she just passed the baby.

692
00:52:27,123 --> 00:52:29,959
[emotional music]

693
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:36,232
[crying]

694
00:52:47,343 --> 00:52:49,577
[whispering] I can't do this.

695
00:52:49,644 --> 00:52:51,180
I can't do this.

696
00:53:08,064 --> 00:53:09,932
At 14 weeks, the brain impulses

697
00:53:09,999 --> 00:53:12,234
in an unborn baby begin to fire.

698
00:53:14,803 --> 00:53:17,705
At 15 weeks, the unborn
baby can sense light.

699
00:53:20,708 --> 00:53:23,678
At 19 weeks, the babies
senses are all developing.

700
00:53:23,745 --> 00:53:25,347
Touch, taste,

701
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:26,614
vision, smell,

702
00:53:26,681 --> 00:53:27,715
and hearing.

703
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:33,255
Christian was 20 weeks old.

704
00:53:34,423 --> 00:53:37,359
[melancholy music]

705
00:54:06,021 --> 00:54:11,227
Dear God, hear us as
we pray for [inaudible].

706
00:54:13,329 --> 00:54:17,665
We pray for their comfort
in a time of sadness.

707
00:54:19,201 --> 00:54:23,973
Hear [inaudible],
in this trying time.

708
00:54:25,474 --> 00:54:30,712
We pray that you lift their
child into a kingdom of light.

709
00:54:33,848 --> 00:54:36,318
In your name we pray, amen.

710
00:54:38,487 --> 00:54:41,390
[melancholy music]

711
00:55:08,683 --> 00:55:10,953
[crying]

712
00:55:19,727 --> 00:55:21,763
I'll clean up, okay?

713
00:55:32,374 --> 00:55:33,409
Look.

714
00:55:35,144 --> 00:55:37,745
You are not alone, all right?

715
00:55:42,384 --> 00:55:44,486
You should come
to church with us.

716
00:56:40,775 --> 00:56:43,245
[smashing]

717
00:56:46,615 --> 00:56:49,151
[screaming]

718
00:56:56,592 --> 00:56:59,428
[emotional music]

719
00:57:12,807 --> 00:57:15,244
[crashing]

720
00:57:33,696 --> 00:57:36,532
[emotional music]

721
00:58:14,737 --> 00:58:16,939
God, I pray for my husband.

722
00:58:20,642 --> 00:58:22,044
He is a good man.

723
00:58:25,748 --> 00:58:28,884
I know deep down
he's a good man.

724
00:58:30,619 --> 00:58:32,554
But he needs you.

725
00:58:32,621 --> 00:58:33,922
He needs your help.

726
00:58:37,726 --> 00:58:40,963
He's still the man that I love.

727
00:58:41,029 --> 00:58:42,398
He's my Jonah,

728
00:58:46,268 --> 00:58:47,603
and he's lost at sea.

729
00:58:50,873 --> 00:58:52,141
He needs you.

730
00:58:57,112 --> 00:58:58,614
This is my last prayer, God,

731
00:59:00,315 --> 00:59:04,286
and I don't know how,
but he needs your help.

732
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:14,296
We need your help
for our family.

733
00:59:16,331 --> 00:59:17,166
For me.

734
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:19,935
For Ana.

735
00:59:22,838 --> 00:59:24,173
For Jonathan.

736
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:30,446
[crying] I need you to
bring him back to me.

737
00:59:34,049 --> 00:59:36,018
Please help him, God.

738
00:59:39,688 --> 00:59:40,956
Bring him back.

739
00:59:48,697 --> 00:59:49,899
Okay, yep.

740
00:59:49,965 --> 00:59:51,266
[Female Officer]
Officer Hickory,

741
00:59:51,333 --> 00:59:52,634
report to Lieutenant
Campbell's office.

742
00:59:52,701 --> 00:59:54,069
Let me call you back.

743
01:00:10,819 --> 01:00:12,054
Johnathan, come in.

744
01:00:13,856 --> 01:00:16,425
These detectives are
from internal affairs.

745
01:00:17,726 --> 01:00:18,727
Have a seat.

746
01:00:20,562 --> 01:00:22,598
[Jonathan] Can I ask
what this is all about?

747
01:00:22,664 --> 01:00:25,434
I think you know
why they're here.

748
01:00:25,501 --> 01:00:26,401
You're under investigation for

749
01:00:26,468 --> 01:00:28,504
violating our code of conduct.

750
01:00:29,771 --> 01:00:31,473
You'd better hope
we don't find out

751
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:33,876
you were involved
in immoral conduct.

752
01:00:33,943 --> 01:00:35,177
You are to hand over your

753
01:00:35,244 --> 01:00:37,246
departmental laptop
and cell phones,

754
01:00:37,312 --> 01:00:40,048
along with all the lock
codes and passwords.

755
01:00:41,216 --> 01:00:44,019
And you will not discuss this
investigation with anyone,

756
01:00:44,086 --> 01:00:45,120
is that clear?

757
01:00:47,656 --> 01:00:48,524
You're dismissed.

758
01:00:49,591 --> 01:00:52,060
[eerie music]

759
01:01:18,086 --> 01:01:20,722
This is the story of Jonah.

760
01:01:21,925 --> 01:01:23,425
Jonah was a good man,

761
01:01:25,827 --> 01:01:27,396
but he was scared.

762
01:01:32,134 --> 01:01:33,802
[Ana] What did he do, mommy?

763
01:01:37,573 --> 01:01:40,742
[Stacy] Jonah didn't know
that God had a purpose for him,

764
01:01:43,512 --> 01:01:47,082
that God had a special
mission for him,

765
01:01:51,253 --> 01:01:55,157
and God found a way
to get his attention.

766
01:02:00,829 --> 01:02:02,230
God sent a storm,

767
01:02:05,969 --> 01:02:10,105
and he sent a big fish
to go and get Jonah,

768
01:02:15,344 --> 01:02:17,112
and bring him back.

769
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:31,894
And in the end Jonah
did the right thing.

770
01:02:39,102 --> 01:02:42,838
He did God's final
wish, and he came back.

771
01:02:50,846 --> 01:02:52,781
He did the right thing.

772
01:02:56,151 --> 01:02:59,154
[gun clicking]

773
01:02:59,889 --> 01:03:02,391
[tense music]

774
01:03:16,672 --> 01:03:18,908
[coughing]

775
01:03:22,145 --> 01:03:24,914
[gun clicking]

776
01:03:40,195 --> 01:03:42,631
[bell ringing]

777
01:03:42,698 --> 01:03:45,467
What's the point of this life?

778
01:03:45,534 --> 01:03:48,303
What difference does it make?

779
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:51,306
[choral singing]

780
01:04:30,445 --> 01:04:32,581
You've seen so much death.

781
01:04:34,951 --> 01:04:37,019
Your whole profession revolves

782
01:04:37,086 --> 01:04:38,787
around the evil in this world.

783
01:04:40,422 --> 01:04:43,825
You see Satan's
handiwork everyday.

784
01:04:46,028 --> 01:04:46,996
It must be tough.

785
01:04:51,901 --> 01:04:55,004
The thief comes to steal,

786
01:04:56,338 --> 01:04:57,372
to kill,

787
01:04:58,340 --> 01:04:59,641
and to destroy.

788
01:05:01,843 --> 01:05:05,514
You've let him rob
you of your peace,

789
01:05:06,715 --> 01:05:09,584
of your family, of your life.

790
01:05:11,154 --> 01:05:12,654
It's time you fought back.

791
01:05:13,923 --> 01:05:16,691
[choral singing]

792
01:05:30,806 --> 01:05:33,608
You need the only one who's
ever overcome this evil.

793
01:05:35,343 --> 01:05:36,812
You need Jesus.

794
01:05:39,648 --> 01:05:42,985
You've been doing things
your way your whole life.

795
01:05:44,187 --> 01:05:45,922
How's that working out for you?

796
01:05:48,623 --> 01:05:50,592
It's time you did
things God's way.

797
01:05:52,327 --> 01:05:53,795
I don't know.

798
01:05:55,363 --> 01:05:56,398
I do.

799
01:05:57,967 --> 01:06:01,336
You need to be honest
about your affair,

800
01:06:02,404 --> 01:06:03,805
about your drinking,

801
01:06:03,872 --> 01:06:05,841
about the way you've been
treating your family.

802
01:06:06,775 --> 01:06:10,512
There are consequences
to your actions

803
01:06:11,413 --> 01:06:13,015
and Jesus is not
going to change that.

804
01:06:16,018 --> 01:06:19,121
But Jesus will change you.

805
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:22,124
You want to be a man about this?

806
01:06:22,191 --> 01:06:23,960
You want to make things right?

807
01:06:25,061 --> 01:06:26,028
You want to fix it?

808
01:06:28,864 --> 01:06:31,566
First you have to surrender
yourself to Jesus.

809
01:06:34,502 --> 01:06:35,804
That's the first step.

810
01:06:50,052 --> 01:06:54,023
Honey, I realized I
made a lot of mistakes.

811
01:06:55,523 --> 01:06:57,425
I know I haven't
been good to you.

812
01:06:58,261 --> 01:07:00,029
I know I've been a disaster.

813
01:07:01,763 --> 01:07:03,299
But that's all going to change,

814
01:07:03,366 --> 01:07:07,970
because last night I
made a promise to God.

815
01:07:09,939 --> 01:07:12,208
I spoke to him for
the first time,

816
01:07:13,209 --> 01:07:15,777
and I promised Him that I'm
going to be a better man,

817
01:07:15,844 --> 01:07:18,580
better father, better husband.

818
01:07:18,647 --> 01:07:20,950
I'm going to make it
up to you and Ana.

819
01:07:24,853 --> 01:07:27,156
Stacy, what I'm
asking is forgive me.

820
01:07:28,925 --> 01:07:29,758
Please.

821
01:07:38,867 --> 01:07:40,202
Okay.

822
01:07:40,269 --> 01:07:41,469
I'm working on it.

823
01:07:43,738 --> 01:07:45,141
I'm going to be better.

824
01:07:54,183 --> 01:07:56,651
Okay, this one's for you,

825
01:07:56,718 --> 01:07:58,421
and this one's for me.

826
01:07:58,486 --> 01:07:59,688
Careful, you got it?

827
01:08:01,556 --> 01:08:04,026
Wow, say thank you.

828
01:08:04,093 --> 01:08:05,094
Thank you.

829
01:08:06,195 --> 01:08:08,630
[laughing]

830
01:08:11,167 --> 01:08:13,202
Jonathan, you do you
know that this is strange,

831
01:08:13,269 --> 01:08:14,136
right?

832
01:08:15,137 --> 01:08:19,275
You sitting here with
us getting ice cream,

833
01:08:19,342 --> 01:08:20,977
spending time with us.

834
01:08:22,111 --> 01:08:23,179
[whispering]

835
01:08:23,245 --> 01:08:24,646
It's gonna get better.

836
01:08:24,713 --> 01:08:26,648
Exactly what she said.

837
01:08:29,051 --> 01:08:31,454
Jonathan, our
family needs this.

838
01:08:31,519 --> 01:08:34,223
I know, I promise things
are going to change.

839
01:08:36,993 --> 01:08:38,427
Next time we're
getting pizza, right?

840
01:08:38,493 --> 01:08:40,162
No, ice cream.

841
01:08:40,229 --> 01:08:41,330
Ice cream again.

842
01:08:41,397 --> 01:08:42,932
Ice cream, uh-huh.

843
01:08:44,133 --> 01:08:46,135
[phone buzzing]

844
01:08:46,202 --> 01:08:46,601
Is it good?

845
01:08:46,668 --> 01:08:47,669
[Ana] Yeah.

846
01:08:47,736 --> 01:08:48,803
Yeah, all right.

847
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:50,306
[Jonathan] I'm
gonna take this, okay?

848
01:08:50,373 --> 01:08:51,140
Be right back.

849
01:08:51,207 --> 01:08:51,974
Okay.

850
01:08:52,774 --> 01:08:53,943
Lieutenant?

851
01:08:54,010 --> 01:08:55,911
Jonathan, I need to
see you in my office.

852
01:08:55,978 --> 01:08:57,846
I have to result of
your investigation.

853
01:08:57,913 --> 01:08:59,181
What flavor are you
going to get next time?

854
01:08:59,248 --> 01:09:00,149
[Ana] Vanilla.

855
01:09:00,216 --> 01:09:01,283
You didn't like this one?

856
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:02,817
[Ana] No.

857
01:09:02,885 --> 01:09:05,121
All right, I guess
I'll see you then.

858
01:09:16,232 --> 01:09:18,134
Oh my goodness gracious.

859
01:09:20,269 --> 01:09:21,504
Who was it?

860
01:09:21,569 --> 01:09:23,105
Oh, it was Lieutenant.

861
01:09:23,172 --> 01:09:24,040
They need you?

862
01:09:24,106 --> 01:09:25,874
No, just saying hi.

863
01:09:27,243 --> 01:09:28,077
Okay.

864
01:09:29,311 --> 01:09:32,248
[engine revving]

865
01:09:34,517 --> 01:09:37,186
[bells chiming]

866
01:10:00,443 --> 01:10:01,210
You again?

867
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:05,214
Well, at least this time you
don't have your gun drawn.

868
01:10:06,614 --> 01:10:07,782
I need your help.

869
01:10:10,086 --> 01:10:10,920
Sure.

870
01:10:12,121 --> 01:10:13,089
What's going on?

871
01:10:18,294 --> 01:10:19,361
I'm an idiot.

872
01:10:20,829 --> 01:10:22,664
I take it you
haven't told her.

873
01:10:26,268 --> 01:10:27,303
No, I haven't.

874
01:10:30,772 --> 01:10:32,274
You need to tell
her, Jonathan.

875
01:10:32,341 --> 01:10:33,275
I can't tell her.

876
01:10:34,742 --> 01:10:36,678
She's going to
leave and take Ana.

877
01:10:38,114 --> 01:10:39,982
I don't know what I would
do if I lost them both.

878
01:10:40,049 --> 01:10:41,850
Well, if you don't tell her,

879
01:10:41,917 --> 01:10:44,019
you're going to lose
them both anyway.

880
01:10:50,126 --> 01:10:53,728
I sense there's
something else going on.

881
01:10:58,167 --> 01:11:01,203
The force, they found
out about the affair,

882
01:11:02,737 --> 01:11:04,706
did an entire investigation.

883
01:11:06,175 --> 01:11:08,344
I'm about to find
out if I lost my job.

884
01:11:10,346 --> 01:11:11,147
I screwed up.

885
01:11:13,449 --> 01:11:15,217
Really, really screwed up.

886
01:11:16,585 --> 01:11:18,686
I could really use
a prayer right now.

887
01:11:19,922 --> 01:11:24,726
I told you before, there are
consequences to your actions,

888
01:11:24,792 --> 01:11:28,297
and praying won't
make them go away.

889
01:11:29,864 --> 01:11:32,700
But God promises
to be there to help

890
01:11:32,767 --> 01:11:34,136
you through those consequences.

891
01:11:34,203 --> 01:11:35,938
I'm not asking for a miracle.

892
01:11:36,771 --> 01:11:38,073
I know there are consequences,

893
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:41,043
but I also believe that
God does answer prayers.

894
01:11:41,110 --> 01:11:45,414
Please could you just
say a prayer with me?

895
01:11:50,619 --> 01:11:51,453
Of course.

896
01:12:15,411 --> 01:12:17,880
God, please help
me keep my job.

897
01:12:21,749 --> 01:12:23,018
You know what,

898
01:12:23,085 --> 01:12:24,486
being an officer in this
county is a privilege?

899
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:27,256
Well do you?

900
01:12:27,323 --> 01:12:30,292
We demand all of our
officers be beyond reproach.

901
01:12:30,359 --> 01:12:31,594
All of them.

902
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:32,695
And you?

903
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:33,629
You don't.

904
01:12:33,696 --> 01:12:35,064
Yes sir, I understand...

905
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:37,765
I'm sorry, I believe
I was still speaking.

906
01:12:37,832 --> 01:12:39,368
As for the charge.

907
01:12:39,435 --> 01:12:42,171
Officer behaving in a
scandalous, infamous manner,

908
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:44,607
in violation of
West Virginia code.

909
01:12:44,673 --> 01:12:46,508
For that, you're guilty.

910
01:12:47,842 --> 01:12:50,312
Dismissal without pension,
without severance.

911
01:12:50,379 --> 01:12:51,413
Nothing.

912
01:12:53,449 --> 01:12:54,383
That's the verdict.

913
01:13:00,723 --> 01:13:04,159
[slow emotional music]

914
01:13:22,111 --> 01:13:24,812
This job is all I know, sir.

915
01:13:25,514 --> 01:13:26,882
It's my passion.

916
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:29,451
It's what I'm good at.

917
01:13:31,053 --> 01:13:32,854
It's the only thing I'm good at.

918
01:13:35,024 --> 01:13:37,293
I didn't come here
to make excuses,

919
01:13:38,227 --> 01:13:39,528
but we both know that this line

920
01:13:39,595 --> 01:13:41,163
of work gets inside your head,

921
01:13:42,364 --> 01:13:46,935
and between things I've seen
on the job and losing my son,

922
01:13:47,469 --> 01:13:48,504
I've been a wreck.

923
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:50,172
I've been avoiding my problems,

924
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:52,975
and this job is, being here,

925
01:13:53,042 --> 01:13:54,243
it's the only
thing that makes me

926
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:56,412
feel like I'm
making a difference.

927
01:13:58,247 --> 01:14:00,549
I know I need to be held
accountable for my actions,

928
01:14:00,616 --> 01:14:01,483
and I don't deserve this job.

929
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:03,452
I don't deserve my family.

930
01:14:04,386 --> 01:14:05,654
But I want you to know
that I'm working on it.

931
01:14:05,721 --> 01:14:07,656
I'm going to be a better man.

932
01:14:07,723 --> 01:14:09,425
Look, Jonathan,

933
01:14:09,491 --> 01:14:11,327
I know you, okay?

934
01:14:12,194 --> 01:14:14,997
I know this isn't like you.

935
01:14:15,064 --> 01:14:16,465
Look at me?

936
01:14:16,532 --> 01:14:19,668
You know I'm actually willing
to bet my badge on you.

937
01:14:19,735 --> 01:14:21,170
You know why?

938
01:14:21,236 --> 01:14:24,106
Because at the end of the day
I think you're a good cop,

939
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:28,143
and I truly believe everyone
deserves a second chance.

940
01:14:29,078 --> 01:14:30,379
That's why I fought for you.

941
01:14:30,446 --> 01:14:31,714
And guess what?

942
01:14:32,648 --> 01:14:34,950
That's why I got them to
keep you on the force.

943
01:14:36,851 --> 01:14:37,820
[whispers] Thank you.

944
01:14:37,886 --> 01:14:38,787
Oh no, no,
no, no,

945
01:14:38,853 --> 01:14:40,356
no, don't thank me yet.

946
01:14:40,422 --> 01:14:42,324
Oh no, you will be disciplined.

947
01:14:43,325 --> 01:14:46,295
You will no longer be a
motorcycle or traffic officer,

948
01:14:47,529 --> 01:14:48,497
and that take home vehicle?

949
01:14:48,564 --> 01:14:50,165
Yeah, that's going.

950
01:14:50,232 --> 01:14:53,402
You will immediately be sent
to uniform patrol division,

951
01:14:53,469 --> 01:14:56,238
on a midnight shift,
pushing a cruiser.

952
01:14:56,305 --> 01:14:59,508
Now give me the keys to the
motorcycle and the unmarked.

953
01:15:06,548 --> 01:15:07,649
Look, Jonathan?

954
01:15:09,184 --> 01:15:12,521
I am taking a huge risk on
you, you understand that?

955
01:15:12,588 --> 01:15:14,123
Huge.

956
01:15:14,189 --> 01:15:15,824
Tell me I'm not
making a mistake.

957
01:15:15,891 --> 01:15:17,493
I won't let you down, sir.

958
01:15:20,262 --> 01:15:22,598
These are the keys
to your new ride.

959
01:15:22,664 --> 01:15:23,565
Car 305.

960
01:15:27,436 --> 01:15:29,671
You prove to me
that you can change,

961
01:15:29,738 --> 01:15:34,576
and in a year, maybe we can
reevaluate your performance.

962
01:15:35,611 --> 01:15:36,912
Don't make me regret this.

963
01:15:37,746 --> 01:15:38,647
You're dismissed.

964
01:15:42,651 --> 01:15:45,387
[engine revving]

965
01:16:00,402 --> 01:16:03,105
So what's with the
squad car out there?

966
01:16:05,374 --> 01:16:06,975
I got put back on nights.

967
01:16:07,042 --> 01:16:08,277
Start tomorrow night.

968
01:16:09,511 --> 01:16:10,612
What?

969
01:16:10,679 --> 01:16:12,514
Yeah, I got some
trouble at work.

970
01:16:12,581 --> 01:16:15,017
They swapped me over
to midnight shift.

971
01:16:15,083 --> 01:16:16,318
Jonathan, how?

972
01:16:16,385 --> 01:16:19,889
I mean, you've been
working so hard.

973
01:16:19,955 --> 01:16:21,023
What happened?

974
01:16:22,157 --> 01:16:23,459
It was a vehicle
pursuit a few months ago,

975
01:16:23,525 --> 01:16:24,894
remember the one I
was telling you about?

976
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,028
Yes.

977
01:16:27,596 --> 01:16:28,864
And?

978
01:16:28,932 --> 01:16:31,567
And I gave the
suspect a break.

979
01:16:32,534 --> 01:16:35,604
Didn't write them up, turns
out they had warrants.

980
01:16:36,505 --> 01:16:39,107
Look, I think I'll like
this better anyways.

981
01:16:39,174 --> 01:16:41,844
I wont to have to deal
with seeing the wrecks and,

982
01:16:42,744 --> 01:16:45,147
who knows, maybe
this is a good thing.

983
01:16:45,214 --> 01:16:46,682
A good thing?

984
01:16:47,649 --> 01:16:49,251
Jonathan, how is this
going to be a good thing?

985
01:16:49,318 --> 01:16:50,752
You're never going to see us.

986
01:16:50,819 --> 01:16:52,754
Look, it's only for a while.

987
01:16:52,821 --> 01:16:53,822
Okay?

988
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:55,023
We'll make it work.

989
01:16:56,525 --> 01:16:58,360
Yeah, I guess.

990
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:04,299
I love you, don't worry.

991
01:17:04,366 --> 01:17:06,735
We'll figure it out, okay?

992
01:17:07,769 --> 01:17:10,672
[Stacy] [whispers] Okay.

993
01:17:10,739 --> 01:17:13,308

1260 East Main Street with
a possible carjacking.

997
01:17:53,515 --> 01:17:56,151
Caller stated they say a
large male with a beard

van in the parking lot.

1000
01:18:09,933 --> 01:18:11,366
Hey, freeze!

1001
01:18:11,433 --> 01:18:12,936
[yelling] Stop right there!

1004
01:18:23,712 --> 01:18:25,447
Unit 44, I need back up.

1005
01:18:25,514 --> 01:18:26,883
[Dispatch Woman]
Copy, Unit 44.

1006
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:28,250
We have back up on the way.

1007
01:18:28,317 --> 01:18:31,753
Any available unit
respond to code three.

1010
01:19:04,152 --> 01:19:05,454
Don't move!

1011

[emotional music]

01:19:56,838 --> 01:19:59,875
[bottle clinking]

1013
01:20:16,858 --> 01:20:18,161
Hi Megan, hi Ana,

1014
01:20:18,226 --> 01:20:19,528
what's going on?

1015
01:20:19,594 --> 01:20:20,897
I'm taking Ana to
get some ice cream.

1016
01:20:20,963 --> 01:20:21,964
We'll be right back.

1017
01:20:23,231 --> 01:20:24,499
Oh, okay.

1018
01:20:26,936 --> 01:20:27,803
Hey, what are you doing here?

1019
01:20:27,869 --> 01:20:29,571
Get in the car Jonathan.

1020
01:20:32,441 --> 01:20:33,308
What's going on?

1021
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:34,676
Just get in the car now.

1022
01:20:37,345 --> 01:20:39,982
[slow music]

1023
01:21:03,305 --> 01:21:04,907
Jonathan, what happened?

1024
01:21:09,045 --> 01:21:11,646
You were my best friend.

1025
01:21:11,713 --> 01:21:14,884
You were the one that I
wanted to spend forever with,

1026
01:21:14,951 --> 01:21:17,552
that I loved unconditionally,

1027
01:21:17,619 --> 01:21:20,990
that I went there and I
took these vows with you.

1028
01:21:24,227 --> 01:21:26,661
Does it not mean
anything to you?

1029
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:32,001
What happened to my husband
when I lost my baby?

1030
01:21:33,035 --> 01:21:33,970
Where were you?

1031
01:21:36,038 --> 01:21:39,775
You were getting drunk,
you were disappearing,

1032
01:21:39,841 --> 01:21:43,079
you were working night
shifts and everything else.

1033
01:21:43,146 --> 01:21:44,881
This is what you were doing?

1034
01:21:47,716 --> 01:21:51,921
When I laid there every
night aching in pain,

1035
01:21:53,455 --> 01:21:58,560
needing you here, needing my
husband to come home to me,

1036
01:22:00,462 --> 01:22:02,064
to tell me that he loves me,

1037
01:22:06,701 --> 01:22:09,471
and you're out sleeping
with some other woman?

1038
01:22:09,538 --> 01:22:12,074
Do you even know
what you've done?

1039
01:22:13,742 --> 01:22:16,078
Do you know what
you're doing to me?

1040
01:22:19,949 --> 01:22:25,353
You are not the man that I
married and I want him back.

1041
01:22:35,131 --> 01:22:36,398
You broke us.

1042
01:22:37,166 --> 01:22:38,466
You broke me.

1043
01:22:39,501 --> 01:22:41,003
What happened?

1044
01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:43,039
[sobbing]

1045
01:22:46,042 --> 01:22:48,443
No, because you're not sorry.

1046
01:22:50,712 --> 01:22:52,480
No, don't touch me.

1047
01:22:58,020 --> 01:22:59,989
[sobbing]

1048
01:23:06,095 --> 01:23:09,464
[emotional choral music]

1049
01:23:26,514 --> 01:23:30,152
Stacy, you should
know that the day

1050
01:23:30,219 --> 01:23:31,888
that Jonathan came to see me,

1051
01:23:33,122 --> 01:23:37,159
he told me all about the
demons he was fighting.

1052
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:40,862
He told me about the infidelity.

1053
01:23:42,497 --> 01:23:46,269
He also told me that you
are the love of his life,

1054
01:23:46,936 --> 01:23:49,171
and he didn't feel
like he deserved you.

1055
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:52,074
This is one of
the most difficult

1056
01:23:52,141 --> 01:23:55,744
things that could ever
happen in a marriage.

1057
01:23:57,146 --> 01:24:01,549
Jonathan, it took you years
to break this marriage.

1058
01:24:01,616 --> 01:24:05,087
It's gonna take you a
long time to repair it.

1059
01:24:06,821 --> 01:24:08,057
But you're going to have to ask

1060
01:24:08,124 --> 01:24:09,658
yourself the hardest questions.

1061
01:24:11,493 --> 01:24:13,095
Do you want to fix this?

1062
01:24:16,765 --> 01:24:19,701
Do you want to move
forward to forgiving?

1063
01:24:20,937 --> 01:24:23,838
You're gonna have to look
deep within your heart,

1064
01:24:23,906 --> 01:24:25,440
and you're gonna have to decide

1065
01:24:25,507 --> 01:24:29,011
is this family
worth fighting for?

1066
01:24:35,817 --> 01:24:37,485
It's gonna be a long journey,

1067
01:24:41,324 --> 01:24:46,528
but if you turn toward God,
I think you have a chance.

1068
01:24:49,664 --> 01:24:52,467
[Stacy crying]

1069
01:25:16,092 --> 01:25:17,093
[glass shattering]

1070
01:25:17,159 --> 01:25:18,526
[door slamming]

1071
01:25:18,593 --> 01:25:21,696
[thunder rumbling]

1072
01:25:27,836 --> 01:25:30,973
There are consequences
to your actions,

1073
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,009
and Jesus will not change that.

1074
01:25:35,277 --> 01:25:38,513
But Jesus will change you.

1075
01:25:39,982 --> 01:25:41,117
You want to be a man about this?

1076
01:25:41,183 --> 01:25:42,952
You want to make things right?

1077
01:25:43,886 --> 01:25:45,054
You want to fix it?

1078
01:25:48,057 --> 01:25:50,558
First you have to surrender
yourself to Jesus.

1079
01:25:53,695 --> 01:25:54,997
That's the first step.

1080
01:26:02,570 --> 01:26:05,673
[bottles clinking]

1081
01:26:08,077 --> 01:26:10,913

[smashing]

1084
01:26:40,209 --> 01:26:43,179
I've been a slave to
you for way too long.

1085
01:26:43,245 --> 01:26:48,150
I am sick and tired
of you controlling me.

1086
01:26:55,424 --> 01:26:58,660
God, God please.

1087
01:26:59,794 --> 01:27:02,331
Give me the strength to
break free from these chains.

1088
01:27:05,401 --> 01:27:08,337
[triumphant music]

1089

[glass shattering]

1090
01:27:39,734 --> 01:27:42,338
I don't know where to begin.

1091

[slow music]

1092
01:27:49,145 --> 01:27:54,350
I hate myself, I hate
what I've done to Stacy,

1093
01:27:55,317 --> 01:27:58,354
to my family, to Ana.

1094
01:28:00,022 --> 01:28:03,259
And the weight of all
this is overwhelming,

1095
01:28:03,325 --> 01:28:06,128
and I'm having a lot of
trouble dealing with it.

1096
01:28:08,531 --> 01:28:09,365
Jonathan,

1097
01:28:11,133 --> 01:28:14,436
that burden is not
for you to carry.

1098
01:28:16,038 --> 01:28:21,210
That weight on your shoulders
is for Jesus to carry.

1099
01:28:22,111 --> 01:28:24,879
You have to give it to
him, or it'll crush you.

1100
01:28:27,416 --> 01:28:29,885
I just want my wife
to love me again.

1101
01:28:35,925 --> 01:28:38,760
[glass smashing]

1102
01:28:38,826 --> 01:28:42,031
[breathing heavily]

1103
01:28:46,068 --> 01:28:47,403
It's gonna take time.

1104
01:28:48,938 --> 01:28:50,172
Hey, I can do that for you...

1105
01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:53,075
Don't touch me,
stay away from me.

1106
01:28:55,444 --> 01:28:56,811
It's not gonna be easy.

1107
01:29:04,819 --> 01:29:06,989
You have to push through.

1108
01:29:08,157 --> 01:29:10,092
You have to believe
there's hope.

1109
01:29:11,327 --> 01:29:14,796
She believed for years
that you would turn around.

1110
01:29:17,066 --> 01:29:19,134
Now it's your turn
to believe in her.

1111
01:29:25,507 --> 01:29:30,913
Jesus, help me become the
man my family needs me to be.

1112
01:29:33,815 --> 01:29:35,951
Forgive me for what I've done.

1113
01:29:38,554 --> 01:29:39,888
Help heal our wounds.

1114
01:29:42,191 --> 01:29:45,494
Help me fix this mess
I've made, please.

1115
01:30:05,214 --> 01:30:06,282
Hi, Ana.

1116
01:30:06,348 --> 01:30:08,816
Could I talk to you for
a second, sweetheart?

1117
01:30:13,489 --> 01:30:14,323
Come here.

1118
01:30:16,392 --> 01:30:19,428
You know your daddy loves
you very much, right?

1119
01:30:19,495 --> 01:30:20,462
Very, very,

1120
01:30:20,529 --> 01:30:21,363
very much.

1121
01:30:22,264 --> 01:30:24,933
Look, I know daddy's
been mean a lot lately,

1122
01:30:25,634 --> 01:30:27,636
and that's not your fault, okay?

1123
01:30:28,604 --> 01:30:30,372
I want you to know
that daddy promises

1124
01:30:30,439 --> 01:30:33,542
to never be mean
to you ever again.

1125
01:30:34,910 --> 01:30:35,944
Okay?

1126
01:30:38,547 --> 01:30:40,182
I love you, sweetheart.

1127
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:42,184
I'm sorry.

1128
01:30:43,552 --> 01:30:44,819
Could you forgive me?

1129
01:30:46,622 --> 01:30:49,458
[emotional music]

1130
01:31:34,002 --> 01:31:35,037
Okay.

1131
01:31:36,438 --> 01:31:40,642
Well, before we can make any
changes together as a couple,

1132
01:31:42,077 --> 01:31:44,480
Jonathan, you're gonna
have to face some things.

1133
01:31:44,546 --> 01:31:48,117
Now I know you
have a lot of hurt

1134
01:31:48,183 --> 01:31:49,651
from the loss of your father,

1135
01:31:50,886 --> 01:31:52,588
so I want you to try something.

1136
01:31:53,889 --> 01:31:56,558
We are going to try an exercise.

1137
01:32:02,464 --> 01:32:06,034
I want you to pretend your
father is sitting in this chair.

1138
01:32:06,869 --> 01:32:09,972
[laughing quietly]

1139
01:32:10,939 --> 01:32:15,043
You want me to play
pretend with that chair?

1140
01:32:15,110 --> 01:32:17,346
Jonathan, we're going
to have to work on you

1141
01:32:17,413 --> 01:32:19,915
before we can work on
restoring your marriage.

1142
01:32:22,084 --> 01:32:25,654
Now I want you to
speak to this chair

1143
01:32:26,555 --> 01:32:27,956
as if your father
is sitting in it,

1144
01:32:28,023 --> 01:32:29,491
right here in front of you.

1145
01:32:29,558 --> 01:32:32,694
I want you to say all the
things you wanted to say to him.

1146
01:32:34,596 --> 01:32:37,433
[emotional music]

1147
01:32:50,746 --> 01:32:51,580
Dad?

1148
01:32:57,052 --> 01:32:58,086
Dad?

1149
01:33:03,893 --> 01:33:05,594
Dad, you were my best friend.

1150
01:33:13,001 --> 01:33:14,336
You were my hero.

1151
01:33:19,875 --> 01:33:21,009
I miss you.

1152
01:33:23,879 --> 01:33:25,280
I wish you were here.

1153
01:33:29,585 --> 01:33:31,353
I wish you were here
to see me graduate

1154
01:33:31,420 --> 01:33:34,356
the Academy to become
a police officer.

1155
01:33:36,391 --> 01:33:38,760
I wish you were here
to see me marry Stacy,

1156
01:33:40,262 --> 01:33:42,231
and meet your
granddaughter, Ana.

1157
01:33:45,133 --> 01:33:46,668
She's just like you,

1158
01:33:46,735 --> 01:33:48,504
smart, funny.

1159
01:33:53,275 --> 01:33:54,877
I want to tell you
that I love you,

1160
01:33:54,944 --> 01:33:59,014
because I feel like I didn't
have enough time to tell you.

1161
01:34:00,282 --> 01:34:01,450
It's not fair.

1162
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:05,654
I never heard the words,

1163
01:34:05,721 --> 01:34:06,788
good job, son.

1164
01:34:08,156 --> 01:34:10,526
I miss you, son.

1165
01:34:10,592 --> 01:34:11,660
You're a good son.

1166
01:34:14,796 --> 01:34:16,498
I couldn't say the word dad.

1167
01:34:19,368 --> 01:34:20,937
I just want to
tell you I love you

1168
01:34:21,004 --> 01:34:23,705
because I feel like I didn't
get to tell you enough.

1169
01:34:26,575 --> 01:34:29,044
I feel like God took
you away from me.

1170
01:34:31,747 --> 01:34:34,182
I feel like a piece
of my heart is missing

1171
01:34:34,249 --> 01:34:36,418
and I'm never going
to get it back.

1172
01:34:38,787 --> 01:34:41,823
[emotional music]

1173
01:35:03,845 --> 01:35:05,949
[rain pouring]

1174
01:35:06,015 --> 01:35:07,549
All right, well,

1175
01:35:08,850 --> 01:35:10,519
get home safe, okay?

1176
01:35:37,879 --> 01:35:38,982
[Ana] Yeah, this one's cute.

1177
01:35:39,048 --> 01:35:41,283
[Stacy] Mhm, I like her shoes.

1178
01:35:41,350 --> 01:35:42,651
[Ana] Yeah.

1179
01:35:42,718 --> 01:35:45,021
[Stacy] Hey, who
want's to play a game?

1180
01:35:45,088 --> 01:35:45,854
[Ana] Me!

1181
01:35:45,922 --> 01:35:46,755
You both do?

1182
01:35:48,557 --> 01:35:49,291
Okay.

1183
01:35:49,358 --> 01:35:51,226
Ana, you're first.

1184
01:35:51,293 --> 01:35:52,494
What's it say?

1185
01:35:52,561 --> 01:35:54,931
I am soft and
I help you sleep.

1186
01:35:55,631 --> 01:35:57,532
[Jonathan] That's a tough one.

1187
01:35:57,599 --> 01:36:00,369
What do you think would
help mom and dad sleep?

1188
01:36:01,070 --> 01:36:02,270
A blanket?

1189
01:36:03,472 --> 01:36:05,674
Where do you keep blankets?

1190
01:36:05,741 --> 01:36:06,575
The bedroom.

1191
01:36:09,378 --> 01:36:10,846
I have one for you too.

1192
01:36:19,655 --> 01:36:21,891
[giggling]

1193
01:36:23,092 --> 01:36:23,926
Daddy, I found it.

1194
01:36:23,993 --> 01:36:24,927
It was under the pillow.

1195
01:36:24,994 --> 01:36:25,995
You did, what did you get?

1196
01:36:26,062 --> 01:36:26,996
A princess crown.

1197
01:36:27,063 --> 01:36:29,531
Wow, what a beautiful crown.

1198
01:36:29,598 --> 01:36:32,234
Beautiful crown for
a beautiful princess.

1199
01:36:34,703 --> 01:36:35,470
I got a clue too.

1200
01:36:35,537 --> 01:36:37,073
[Ana] What is it?

1201
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:39,875
Something waits for
you in a safe place.

1202
01:36:39,942 --> 01:36:40,910
What do you think?

1203
01:36:40,977 --> 01:36:41,843
I don't know.

1204
01:36:41,911 --> 01:36:43,211
Could it be in the safe?

1205
01:36:43,278 --> 01:36:44,479
[Ana] Maybe!

1206
01:36:44,546 --> 01:36:45,814
Only one way to
find out, right?

1207
01:36:48,784 --> 01:36:50,953
[beeping]

1208
01:36:56,258 --> 01:36:58,326
What'd you get?

1209
01:36:58,393 --> 01:36:59,327
What'd you get, what'd you get,

1210
01:36:59,394 --> 01:37:00,662
what'd you get?

1211
01:37:02,165 --> 01:37:03,565
What'd you get?

1212
01:37:03,632 --> 01:37:04,733
What'd you get, what'd you get,

1213
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:05,867
what'd you get?

1214
01:37:16,845 --> 01:37:17,879
We're having another baby?

1215
01:37:17,947 --> 01:37:19,314
We're having a baby.

1216
01:37:19,381 --> 01:37:20,716
- We're having a baby?
- We're having a baby.

1217
01:37:20,782 --> 01:37:23,518
We're having a baby,
we're having a baby!

1218
01:37:23,585 --> 01:37:26,388
Oh, we're having a baby.

1219
01:37:28,091 --> 01:37:28,958
Wow!

1220
01:37:29,825 --> 01:37:31,827
You'll need to
learn how to share.

1221
01:37:33,862 --> 01:37:34,696
Yeah, you too.

1222
01:37:38,734 --> 01:37:42,804
Come on now, let's take
a group family picture.

1223
01:37:42,871 --> 01:37:44,006
Okay sweetie?

1224
01:37:44,941 --> 01:37:47,642
Let's get your hair,
grandma likes your hair.

1225
01:37:47,709 --> 01:37:49,979
You're so beautiful,
you know that?

1226
01:37:50,947 --> 01:37:53,682
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1227
01:37:54,884 --> 01:37:56,685
We had faith, you held on.

1228
01:37:59,155 --> 01:38:01,490
I love you, you're my heart.

1229
01:38:03,926 --> 01:38:06,828
I'm just so happy
to have you back.

1230
01:38:08,030 --> 01:38:08,931
I love you.

1231
01:38:13,335 --> 01:38:15,303
Ana, get over here.

1232
01:38:17,106 --> 01:38:18,975
All righty, come on.

1233
01:38:20,509 --> 01:38:23,411
All right, make it a good one.

1234
01:38:24,046 --> 01:38:26,249
All right guys, say cheese.

1235
01:38:26,314 --> 01:38:27,349
Cheese.
