1
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,779
For those regarded as warriors...

2
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,079
...when engaged in combat...

3
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:27,221
...the vanquishing of thine enemy can be the
warriors only concern.

4
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:33,963
Suppress all human emotions and compassion...

5
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:45,275
...kill whoever stands in thy way, even if that be Lord
God,

6
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,205
or Buddha himself.

7
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:58,016
This truth lies at the heart of combat.

8
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:18,264
Look at me Matsumoto...

9
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:23,009
...take a good look at my face.

10
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,316
Look at my eyes.

11
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,615
Look at my nose.

12
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,251
Look at my chin.

13
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,758
Look at my mouth.

14
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:43,157
Do l look familiar?

15
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:50,638
Do l look like someone you murdered!

16
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,423
Welcome...

17
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,866
We have a customer. Bring out some tea, quickly!

18
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:50,831
l'm watching my soap operas.

19
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,977
Lazy bastard...

20
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:55,169
Screw your soap opera...

21
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:59,844
The tea's hot. Why don't you serve it yourself for
once?

22
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:26,728
Hey, what the hell happened to the tea.
Hurry up...goddamit!

23
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,208
Lazy oaf...

24
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:40,308
What'd ya want?

25
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:55,223
One warm sake!

26
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:58,824
Sake? ln the middle of the day?

27
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:03,634
-Day, night, afternoon-
Who gives a damn. Get the sake!

28
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,705
How come l always have to get the sake?

29
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:07,868
You listen well...

30
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,877
For thrity years you make the fish.
l get the sake.

31
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:17,410
lf this were the military, l'd be a General by now!

32
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,923
Oh, so you'd be General, huh?

33
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:23,648
lf you were General, l'd be Emporer,

34
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:29,121
and you'd still get the sake.
So shut up and get the sake!

35
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,198
l'm not bald, okay? l shave my head.

36
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:25,888
What do you want with Hattori Hanzo?

37
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:30,053
l need Japanese steel.

38
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:35,129
Why do you need Japanese steel?

39
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:39,765
l have vermin to kill.

40
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:45,077
l wanted to show you these.

41
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:50,982
However, someone as you, who knows so much,
must surely know...

42
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:57,523
...l no longer make instruments of death.

43
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:07,608
What l have here l keep for their aesthetic and
sentimental value.

44
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:12,578
Yet proud as l am of my life's work...

45
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:20,579
...l have retired.

46
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:57,546
You can sleep here.

47
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:01,756
lt will take me a month to make the sword.

48
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:07,895
l suggest you spend it practicing.

49
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:39,582
l've completed doing...

50
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:46,219
what l swore an oath to God, 28 years ago,

51
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:51,094
...to never do again.

52
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:57,002
l have created, ''something that kills people.''

53
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:04,508
And in that purpose, l was a success.

54
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:17,792
l've done this because philosophically, l am
sympathetic to your aim.

55
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:24,934
l can tell you with no ego, this is my finest sword.

56
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:30,371
lf on yourjourney, you should encounter God...

57
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,632
...God will be cut.

58
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:49,821
Yellow-haired warrior. Go.

59
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:17,303
Do you like Ferraris?

60
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:23,649
Ferrari...ltalian trash.

61
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:34,988
Do you want to fuck me?

62
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:39,564
Don't laugh. Do you want to fuck me, yes or no?

63
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:41,699
Yes.

64
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:47,665
How 'bout now, big boy?

65
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:51,473
Do you still wish to penetrate me...

66
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:57,217
...or is it l...who has penetrated you?

67
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,133
Boss Tanaka! What's the meaning of this outburst?

68
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:53,973
This is a time for celebration!

69
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:58,172
And what exactly are we celebrating?

70
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:00,679
The perversion of our illustrious council?

71
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:06,753
Tanaka, have you gone mad? l will not tolerate this!

72
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:10,019
You're disrespecting our sister! Apologize!

73
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:17,588
Tanaka-San, of what perversion do you speak?

74
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:27,307
My father along with yours, and along with yours,
started this council.

75
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:29,608
And while...

76
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:33,145
...You laugh like stupid donkeys
they weep in the afterlife...

77
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,614
Shut up!

78
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:37,216
...over the perversion committed today!

79
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:43,625
Outrageous! Tanaka, it is you who insults this
council!

80
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:44,625
Bastard!

81
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:47,022
Fuck face!

82
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:48,061
Gentlemen.

83
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:56,872
Tanaka obviously has something on his mind.

84
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:02,166
By all means, allow him to express it.

85
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:07,908
l speak of the perversion done to this council,

86
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:10,611
...which l love...

87
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:13,016
...more than my own children,

88
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:19,318
...by making a Chinese Jap-American half breed
bitch its leader!

89
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:44,681
So that you understand how serious l am...

90
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:48,689
...l'm going to say this in English.

91
01:04:56,792 --> 01:04:58,521
Gentlemen, this meeting is adjourned.

92
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:18,026
You have to say ''Yes, yes, yes'' to any selfish
demands they make.

93
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:20,033
They demand ridiculous things.

94
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:21,797
Shut up-- Do you know what would happen if they
heard you?

95
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:24,270
-What's gonna happen?
-Did you hear about the Tanaka clan?

96
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,807
You're gonna get your head chopped off.

97
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:27,341
No, l don't want that.

98
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:16,316
Yes, it's me.

99
01:13:20,362 --> 01:13:24,355
And if you give us a contact number,
we will get back to you.

100
01:13:37,212 --> 01:13:38,941
Hey. You!

101
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:41,916
Who do you remind me of?

102
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:44,309
Charlie Brown!

103
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:48,956
You're right, he does look like Charlie Brown.

104
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:51,385
Charlie Brown,
Four pepperoni pizzas.

105
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:56,729
-That's not on our menu...
-l don't care, bring them, goddammit!

106
01:13:56,965 --> 01:13:59,433
Hey...hey...
Charlie, give me a kiss.

107
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:06,870
You and l have unfinished business!

108
01:15:37,299 --> 01:15:39,961
Charlie Brown, beat it.

109
01:16:07,195 --> 01:16:08,457
TEAR THE BlTCH APART!

110
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:52,498
Gogo, right?

111
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:58,103
And you're Black Mamba.

112
01:17:59,908 --> 01:18:02,968
Our reputations precede us.

113
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:05,503
Don't they?

114
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:27,096
You call that begging?

115
01:18:33,408 --> 01:18:35,638
You can beg better than that.

116
01:30:06,134 --> 01:30:11,333
Those of you lucky enough to still
have your lives take them with you!

117
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:14,466
However...

118
01:30:16,077 --> 01:30:19,843
...leave the limbs you've lost.

119
01:30:21,182 --> 01:30:24,618
They belong to me now.

120
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:37,848
Where was it made?

121
01:31:43,397 --> 01:31:46,059
Whome in Okinawa made you this steel?

122
01:31:49,437 --> 01:31:50,665
YOU LlE!

123
01:32:03,818 --> 01:32:05,786
Swords however, never get tired.

124
01:32:07,321 --> 01:32:10,950
l hope you've saved your energy.

125
01:32:14,428 --> 01:32:15,793
lf you haven't...

126
01:32:17,865 --> 01:32:19,924
...you might not last five minutes.

127
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:23,962
But as last looks go,

128
01:32:25,106 --> 01:32:26,664
you could do worse.

129
01:35:52,012 --> 01:35:53,639
Attack me...

130
01:35:54,882 --> 01:35:56,474
...with everything you have.

131
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:54,798
For ridiculing you earlier...

132
01:36:56,911 --> 01:36:58,811
...l apologize.

133
01:37:07,521 --> 01:37:08,681
Accepted.

134
01:37:25,339 --> 01:37:26,328
Ready?

135
01:37:31,378 --> 01:37:32,345
Come on.

136
01:38:05,713 --> 01:38:14,587
That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword.

137
01:40:56,884 --> 01:41:01,878
Burn in Hell you stupid, stupid blonde!
l'll tell you nothing.

138
02:31:37,321 --> 02:31:38,413
Master...

139
02:31:40,091 --> 02:31:41,956
Your Mandarin is lousy.

140
02:31:42,960 --> 02:31:46,054
lt causes my ears discomfort. You bray like an ass!

141
02:31:46,630 --> 02:31:49,224
You are not to speak unless spoken to.

142
02:31:49,667 --> 02:31:53,467
ls it too much to hope you understand Cantonese?

143
02:31:57,007 --> 02:31:58,599
l speak Japanese very well...

144
02:31:58,676 --> 02:31:59,870
l didn't ask if you speak Japanese,

145
02:32:00,010 --> 02:32:03,776
l asked if you understand Cantonese?

146
02:32:07,284 --> 02:32:09,775
You are here to learn the mysteries of Kung Fu,

147
02:32:09,954 --> 02:32:11,581
not linguistics.

148
02:32:12,189 --> 02:32:14,123
lf you can't understand me,

149
02:32:14,358 --> 02:32:16,053
l will communicate with you like l would a dog.

150
02:32:16,760 --> 02:32:18,557
When l yell, when l point,

151
02:32:18,696 --> 02:32:19,890
when l beat you with my stick!

152
02:32:25,503 --> 02:32:27,664
Bill is your master, is he not?

153
02:32:33,477 --> 02:32:37,413
Your master tells me you're not entirely unschooled.

154
02:32:38,415 --> 02:32:40,110
What training do you possess?

155
02:32:48,559 --> 02:32:49,617
''The exquisite art of the samurai sword.''

156
02:32:49,727 --> 02:32:50,887
Don't make me laugh!

157
02:32:51,395 --> 02:32:54,387
Your so-called exquisite art, is only fit for...

158
02:32:55,466 --> 02:32:57,434
Japanese fatheads!

159
02:33:03,107 --> 02:33:05,940
Your anger amuses me.

160
02:33:06,076 --> 02:33:08,374
Do you believe you are my match?

161
02:33:08,812 --> 02:33:09,471
No.

162
02:33:10,247 --> 02:33:12,147
Are you aware l kill at will?

163
02:33:13,017 --> 02:33:13,574
Yes.

164
02:33:14,552 --> 02:33:15,610
ls it your wish to die?

165
02:33:16,187 --> 02:33:16,778
No.

166
02:33:18,756 --> 02:33:19,688
Then you must be stupid...

167
02:33:20,191 --> 02:33:21,852
Then you must be stupid...so stupid.

168
02:33:22,393 --> 02:33:26,193
Rise, and let me look at your ridiculous face.

169
02:33:26,630 --> 02:33:27,324
Rise.

170
02:33:32,236 --> 02:33:33,828
So, my pathetic friend,

171
02:33:34,805 --> 02:33:37,672
is there anything that you can do well?

172
02:33:38,776 --> 02:33:40,141
What's the matter?

173
02:33:41,045 --> 02:33:42,910
Cat got your tongue?

174
02:33:44,215 --> 02:33:47,548
Oh yes, you speak Japanese.

175
02:33:47,952 --> 02:33:48,816
l despise the goddamn Japs!

176
02:33:52,656 --> 02:33:53,588
Go to that rack.

177
02:34:02,533 --> 02:34:03,465
Remove the sword.

178
02:34:29,893 --> 02:34:31,758
Let's see how good you really are.

179
02:34:32,596 --> 02:34:33,620
lf...

180
02:34:34,698 --> 02:34:36,359
you land a single blow,

181
02:34:38,369 --> 02:34:40,701
l'll bow down and call you ''master.''

182
02:34:54,451 --> 02:34:57,113
From here you can getan excellentviewof myfoot.

183
02:35:01,825 --> 02:35:05,317
Your swordsmanship is amateur at best.

184
02:35:19,410 --> 02:35:25,007
Your so-called kung-fu is really...quite pathetic.

185
02:35:27,518 --> 02:35:31,420
l asked you to demonstrate
what you know and you did...

186
02:35:31,989 --> 02:35:33,081
Not a goddamn thing!

187
02:35:34,258 --> 02:35:38,627
Let's see your Tiger-Crane match my Eagle's Claw.

188
02:36:34,918 --> 02:36:36,681
Like all Yankee women,

189
02:36:37,221 --> 02:36:38,984
all you can do is order in restaurants...

190
02:36:39,123 --> 02:36:40,556
and spend a man's money.

191
02:36:41,759 --> 02:36:43,226
Excruciating, isn't it?

192
02:36:43,694 --> 02:36:44,752
Yes!

193
02:36:46,163 --> 02:36:47,721
lf it was my wish...

194
02:36:48,065 --> 02:36:49,498
l could chop your arm off.

195
02:36:52,169 --> 02:36:53,636
lt's my arm now. l can do what l please.

196
02:36:53,737 --> 02:36:57,138
lf you can stop me, l suggest you try.

197
02:37:01,945 --> 02:37:03,071
Because you're helpless?

198
02:37:03,847 --> 02:37:04,609
Yes.

199
02:37:07,351 --> 02:37:09,512
Have you ever felt this before?

200
02:37:10,120 --> 02:37:10,848
No.

201
02:37:11,288 --> 02:37:12,812
Compared to me,

202
02:37:12,923 --> 02:37:14,618
you're as helpless as a worm fighting an eagle?

203
02:37:15,559 --> 02:37:16,457
Yes!

204
02:37:18,762 --> 02:37:19,456
That's the beginning!

205
02:37:25,436 --> 02:37:27,802
ls it your wish to possess this kind of power?

206
02:37:33,911 --> 02:37:36,709
Your training will begin...tomorrow.

207
02:37:45,489 --> 02:37:46,820
Since your arm now belongs to me...

208
02:37:47,758 --> 02:37:48,986
l want it strong.

209
02:37:50,661 --> 02:37:52,026
Can you do that?

210
02:37:53,664 --> 02:37:54,961
l can, but not that close.

211
02:37:55,466 --> 02:37:56,398
Then you can't do it.

212
02:37:57,734 --> 02:38:02,671
What if your enemy is three inches in front of you?

213
02:38:02,840 --> 02:38:03,864
What do you do then?

214
02:38:05,242 --> 02:38:06,300
Curl into a ball,

215
02:38:07,678 --> 02:38:10,146
or do you put your fist through him?

216
02:38:10,848 --> 02:38:11,542
Now begin.

217
02:38:43,814 --> 02:38:46,282
lt's the wood that should fear your hand,

218
02:38:46,450 --> 02:38:47,712
not the other way around.

219
02:38:48,619 --> 02:38:50,348
No wonder you can't do it,

220
02:38:51,054 --> 02:38:54,854
you acquiesce to defeat, before you even begin.

221
02:40:42,933 --> 02:40:44,901
lf you want to eat like a dog,

222
02:40:46,403 --> 02:40:48,598
you can live and sleep outside like a dog.

223
02:40:51,041 --> 02:40:53,441
lf you want to live and sleep like a human,

224
02:40:54,645 --> 02:40:55,441
pick up those sticks.

225
03:02:47,690 --> 03:02:49,954
Elle, you treacherous dog.

226
03:02:55,798 --> 03:02:58,062
l give you my word...

227
03:11:15,130 --> 03:11:16,529
Clarita

228
03:11:25,507 --> 03:11:25,973
Tequila.

229
03:11:39,688 --> 03:11:40,620
Thanks.

230
