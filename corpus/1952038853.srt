Come on over here.

Hello, Officer Friend.
How are you?

Hold it, hold it.
Hold it.

This ain't gettin' us anywhere.
This place is
too goddamn secure.

481
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,160
At least the good news is,
they can't get in either.

482
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:15,603
That means we just sit tight
and wait 'til the cops show up.

Who's gonna call the cops,
the pigeons or the rats?

486
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:29,914
What about a patrol car?
Don't patrol cars come
around here?

487
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:34,014
Think they'd throw a guy off the
roof in broad daylight if there
was a chance cops would come?

488
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,559
Cops ain't comin' by, Vince.
We're on our own here.

489

I'm gonna take 11.
You're gonna take 10.

00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:43,391
That way whoever's
got the gun can reload.

491
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:47,301
Listen, I got an idea.
Why don't we bust down
through this floor...

492
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:50,067
and drop down to the
apartment right below us?

493
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:53,007
That ain't gonna work.
Lfthe layous the same

Tell Wickey to call me up
