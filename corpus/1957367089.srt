1
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,153
Good morning Fresno, California.

2
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:38,699
It's a scorching 97 degrees in the
shade so it feels like Armageddon.

3
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:41,077
Stay safe and drink
plenty of water.

4
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:47,101
We have a brand new song for you this morning from our very own
Central Valley artist, Phillip Kellenback and Benjamin Adams.

5
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:52,338
Keep cool, stay hydrated but most
important, be safe in the heat.

6
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:55,323
Here is their new song "AO".

7
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:17,923
Hi Alison.

8
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,147
Hey.

9
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,429
What do we have?

10
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:26,765
In room 8, we have a 26 year old
female with severe abdominal pain.

11
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,751
The ER doc has seen her
and ordered an ultrasound.

12
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,146
She's now just resting
on some pain meds.

13
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,370
Ok.

14
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:39,093
In room 9, we have a twenty year old male that came in with
a non-displaced forehead fracture and lac while moshing.

15
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,864
The CT of his brain is negative.

16
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:42,908
Genius!

17
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:48,932
In room 11, we have an elderly male with congestive heart failure
and complains of shortness of breath, but his vital signs are stable.

18
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:51,791
Ok.

19
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:55,818
And room 12 we have a thirteen year
old girl with a broken jaw from a fall.

20
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:57,589
And that's it.

21
00:03:57,613 --> 00:04:01,699
Ok, well, that doesn't seem too
bad. I'll take over from here.

22
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,178
You have a good day.

23
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:04,452
Have a good shift.

24
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:07,932
Nu pashen rume fah.

25
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,433
What?

26
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,061
New patient room 4.

27
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,254
Oh, Thank you.

28
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,732
Good Morning.

29
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,258
How are you ladies?

30
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,886
Oh. What happened to you?

31
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,430
My boyfriend did this to me.

32
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,641
What about you?

33
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,436
We need moral support too.

34
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,837
So what happened to you?

35
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,799
I was drunk and I fell.

36
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,034
I tripped on something
and I landed on my chin.

37
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:52,244
Ok, do you have any medical
problems that you know of?

38
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,813
No.

39
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:57,064
Do you take any medications
or have any allergies?

40
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,631
No.

41
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,719
Doctor, excuse me, she
hasn't had her pain meds yet.

42
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:08,867
Ya, she has a left angle fracture but she is not
in severe pain right now and no airway issues.

43
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,828
Hey, I need you for
something right now please!

44
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:11,913
Ya, the girl with the
broken jaw, right?

45
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,247
No. No, can you put
that on hold for now.

46
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:13,707
Yes.

47
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:18,085
We have an MVA in the trauma bay and he is bleeding
profusely from his mouth and we need to intubate him.

48
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,129
Oh, shit...

49
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:22,113
Can I call you back. We have
a bigger problem here. Ok.

50
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:29,806
EIGHTY PALP.

51
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,098
I just can't see
anything in there.

52
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,308
EIGHTY PALP.

53
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,459
He needs to be
intubated right now!

54
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,287
EIGHTY PALP.

55
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,636
Yeah, I need silk suture with a large needle and
a ton of silver nitrate with packing. Now, Now!

56
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,899
See what you can do.

57
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,795
Ok, I can see the cords

58
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,944
hand me the tube and give
me some cricoid pressure.

59
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,371
Ok, I'm in.

60
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,586
I hear breath
sounds, we're good!

61
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,926
You know, for an intern
he's got some big cojones!

62
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,827
Sorry, I finished so fast.

63
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:55,540
Same ol story. It doesn't
matter, I get paid either way.

64
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:02,064
Can you at least humor me
and pretend you enjoy it?

65
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,607
Why should you care?

66
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:07,986
I don't know. I mean I know I
pay you for sex but come on,

67
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,513
that doesn't mean I have
to get my ego deflated.

68
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,700
Jesus, the Tina thing again?

69
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:18,896
Oh gawd no. That was a
long time ago. I'm over it.

70
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,087
Sorry, Ron.

71
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,239
My daughter's got chicken pox
and I'm just worried about her.

72
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,200
She wanna come to the ER?

73
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:37,707
No, she's doing better.
She'll be alright.

74
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:43,129
Alright, well you know it's
good that she got it so early...

75
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,304
I gotta go.

76
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,871
Remember, chicken soup and rest.

77
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,939
Spend some time with her.

78
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:18,307
Come on. What the
fuck! Give it back!

79
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,975
Alright we got a
Peepin' Tom here.

80
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:25,063
Hey man, you're starting to look like a retard with all your staring. Just
because you guys are in math class together, doesn't mean she's into you.

81
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,565
Ya.

82
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,549
She's into studly athletes not
boys that play Dungeons N Dragons.

83
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,820
Fuck you and you.

84
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,681
Really, is that all you got? Come on
man, lets go get something to eat.

85
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,977
I'm good.

86
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:48,462
Hey man, your going to college next year.
There'll be tons of girls and you'll find one.

87
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,072
Yes, even you.

88
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,909
Come on, let's go eat.

89
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:40,913
So his painful abdomen pain and nausea was resolved
with 4 milligrams of Zofran and now he's just resting.

90
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,058
Ok.

91
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,517
In room five, we
have a nightmare.

92
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,770
Fifty-three year old male that came
in with a bleeding and painful mouth.

93
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:51,108
He's been trying to drink from his Gatorade
bottle but now says that his pain is unbearable.

94
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:55,654
I tried to start an IV on him but he
wouldn't cooperate and cussed me out.

95
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,365
He's very rude and
grumpy to the staff.

96
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,391
I have to say, he's an asshole.

97
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,079
I'll get the doc to call the oral
surgeon for him. Have a good day.

98
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,479
Take care, Ron.

99
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:12,588
He's interested in that and
good thing its not on backorder.

100
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,114
I'll fill out the forms ASAP.

101
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:31,005
Yeah, so I will get those forms
sent out to you right away.

102
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,692
Damn, they still
haven't changed my ID.

103
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,861
What's the problem.

104
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,761
It should say head nurse.

105
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,015
Anyhow, uh you have the
yellow pages around here?

106
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,784
Uh...

107
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,786
Yes, what do you need it for?

108
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,206
Need an exterminator. There are
all these roaches in my house.

109
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,066
A... B... C... D...

110
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,694
You can't be putting that shit
in my mouth! It's gonna hurt.

111
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,590
Sir, I'm gonna need
your temperature...

112
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,425
Shit in my mouth!

113
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,593
You ain't putting fuck all
over my mouth, alright?

114
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,011
That's ok, I'll
take over from here.

115
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,235
Sure.

116
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,350
Just relax, ok, calm down.

117
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,018
I'll get you something
for the pain, I promise.

118
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,293
Thank you.

119
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,813
I need to ask you
some questions though.

120
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,172
Ok... fine.

121
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,591
So when did your
mouth start hurting?

122
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,819
About seven months ago.

123
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,805
But the pain got excruciating
about two months ago.

124
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,632
How do you eat?

125
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:28,938
I don't. I just drink and
now the pain is intolerable.

126
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,291
You waited seven months
to see someone about this?

127
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:36,570
I don't have a car, my asshole son
wouldn't drive me. I had to catch a bus.

128
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,689
Ok.

129
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,494
Well, any medical issues?

130
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,204
High blood pressure.

131
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,017
Got that in Nam.

132
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,961
They opened me up, put
a malar screen in me.

133
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,381
Took it out a about
two years ago.

134
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,445
War is hell.

135
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,072
Huh,

136
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,807
only two people
made it in my unit.

137
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,729
I got lucky,

138
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,607
or unlucky, I guess.

139
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:19,923
Man he doesn't look good and he has
no family around take care of him.

140
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:23,951
I mean he can barely eat from
all the bleeding in his mouth.

141
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:31,077
Hey uhh, Jim is gonna need a biopsy
on his mouth and possible trach.

142
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,878
Doesn't look good.

143
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,282
So this prostitute comes in,
right, ripped clothes and all

144
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,159
and you can see half of her tit.

145
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:51,246
She has this huge bruise on the side
of her face and she says that her

146
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,915
boyfriend hit her.

147
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,042
He probably slapped her
on the face with his dick.

148
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,211
The poor bitch suffered
a cheek bone fracture.

149
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,714
Ok, shut the hell up,
already... Both of you!

150
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:03,633
Hey, man what's with you?
We're just joking around.

151
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,469
She's a patient.

152
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,387
She's a hooker.

153
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:10,664
You stupid, insensitive
nursing student.

154
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,533
Ok, boss!

155
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,796
Won't do it again!

156
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:32,663
Hi.

157
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,206
Hey Josh, this is Ron.

158
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,832
Hey Ronny, what's up?

159
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:41,630
Hey man, umm just wanna check and see if I can stay at your
pad for a couple of nights? I got exterminators at my place.

160
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,799
No, that's totally cool.

161
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:49,763
In fact, my wife and I are going to St. Lucia for the whole
week and I was gonna ask if you could house sit, if you'd like.

162
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:55,787
That's awesome. Ya, thank you. And look, I'll take care of
you're place, it will be in stellar shape when you get back.

163
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:56,979
Cool.

164
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:01,799
Alright, well, thanks man.
You guys have fun. Bye.

165
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,079
Susan, my love.

166
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,039
Hi Ron, how are you?

167
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,458
Are any of the doctors prescribing
any of your drugs today?

168
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,419
We'll see, I have a presentation
to give them at four.

169
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,506
Well, don't worry, I mean,
you have the charm and

170
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,467
we'll just get the plastic surgery to
fix your looks so it will be all good.

171
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,177
Ron, you're a dork.

172
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,971
Dorks are sexy now.

173
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,331
Ron, who's that guy?

174
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,754
Oral Surgery intern, Dr. Pir.

175
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,486
Wait, you like him?

176
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,323
I mean, I can introduce you if you
want. Don't know if he's single though.

177
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,285
I hear, he's gay.

178
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,227
No, silly.

179
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,022
Best of luck with
the presentation.

180
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,764
Thanks Ron.

181
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,964
Tonight, shocking
developments from "sign scam".

182
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:34,844
Police say these young men were responsible for
ruthless crime spree after the KMPH sign was stolen.

183
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:40,433
The save our state initiative to curb illegal
immigration. What effect on valley agriculture

184
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,395
we can't deny many illegal
immigrants do pick up our crops

185
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:47,107
the situation in Haiti summed
up in one word, hell...

186
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,566
Hi, you reached the
Josh Bergeman residence.

187
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,443
Leave a message after the beep,

188
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:55,014
but don't be a punk if you get caught
driving drunk, you can call me at my office.

189
00:16:56,598 --> 00:17:01,729
Those stories and the rest of the day's news.
Friday, the last day of September, 1994.

190
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,602
Hi,

191
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,991
I saw the work you did on
thatn girl's face. Impressive.

192
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:17,846
Oh, thank you... but, unfortunately, I
think she's gonna have some scarring.

193
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,831
Oh. You guys are like,
plastic surgeons.

194
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,584
Well, at least in
this hospital we are.

195
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,895
Hi, I'm Ardy.

196
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,148
Susan. It's a pleasure.

197
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,816
Likewise...

198
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,799
May I...

199
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,302
Absolutely...

200
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,491
Well, you do know I prescribe
your drugs to patients at times.

201
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,076
You know it has...

202
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:45,165
Yes, I know... It has hydrocodone, which is an opiod,
and acetominophen to help synergistically relieve pain.

203
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,333
You came to my presentation!

204
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,879
No, but I read one
of your pamphlets.

205
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,465
I like to know what it is that
I'm actually giving my patients.

206
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:57,343
I see... finally, I meet
a well informed doctor.

207
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,179
Thank you...

208
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:01,264
That pair of legs can walk right up
and make an ass out of themselves.

209
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,766
Shhh...

210
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,602
I gotta have her!

211
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,353
She's from Eastern Europe.

212
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,564
Don't you think you have
enough on your plate right now?

213
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:15,588
Oh, but look at her... she's
perfect! Smart, beautiful! Uuuhh!

214
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,949
Ya, but you've had good girls
before. You know what your problem is

215
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,433
you're never satisfied.

216
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,896
Look at her! I don't
think she shits.

217
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,417
You know, you and the
doc got a lot in common

218
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:33,254
both good looking, both
workout, but wait a minute,

219
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,381
he's an Oral Surgeon.

220
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,841
He's a dentist!

221
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:39,636
Ya, you keep telling
yourself that pal.

222
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,623
Do me a favor, try not to
be too creepy, I'm out.

223
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,310
That's three extra days that
she's here because of placement.

224
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:51,147
I know, there's your tax
dollars but to good use, right?

225
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:56,152
Anyway, I have the new
resident directory.

226
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,845
Any hotties?

227
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,563
Oh, that OBGYN guy is cute.

228
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,315
Ya, but he is gay...

229
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,460
Hey, I'm Ron.

230
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,087
Lisa.

231
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:14,922
Nice to meet you.

232
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,841
Well, a patient needs
placement in 302.

233
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,450
Ok.

234
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,138
I'm a social worker here.

235
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,265
That's great

236
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,391
I started working
about two weeks ago.

237
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,434
Nice.

238
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,395
And you are...

239
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,772
Huh, a nurse.

240
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,340
Um... a head nurse.

241
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,279
So can I take you out some time?

242
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,489
We just met and you
already wanna take me out?

243
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:45,934
Yup. Shouldn't social
workers be social?

244
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,772
Oh ho... Well, I'm a lady.

245
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,234
That's ok

246
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:59,174
Ron, trauma activation,
trauma bay four right now.

247
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,342
So you'll give it
a thought, right?

248
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,035
Come on!

249
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,097
Dude, what are you doing.

250
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:09,809
She's not looking for a partner,
she's looking for a rich doctor.

251
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:13,021
That's how she's gonna
become suckssexfull.

252
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,606
Then what's the hurt in trying?

253
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,024
You're wasting your time?

254
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,734
I got all the time in the world.

255
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,509
Do ya?

256
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,489
There is no trauma
activation. Is there?

257
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,908
You're gonna thank
me for this later.

258
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:28,703
Ya, thank you for helping
me to not get laid.

259
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,206
Anyhow, come help me
print out some labs.

260
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,375
Why, all you gotta to do is log
on to the main terminal to the ER.

261
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,878
Come on man, you know that I
don't know shit about computers.

262
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,946
What are you a moron?

263
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,222
Hey Karen. Can I use
you phone please.

264
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,307
Sure.

265
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,998
Thank you.

266
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:05,180
Hi, yes um, I'm a nurse at the ER. I just wanted
to see if Mr. Maple has had his surgery yet.

267
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:12,807
Oh... the case has been postponed
for tomorrow... ok, Thank you.

268
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,235
Thank you.

269
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:29,138
Weren't you terrified that you might
get shot and killed in an instant?

270
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,622
I was young.

271
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:37,313
You don't think about the extent
of things when your that age.

272
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:40,024
You just do what
you're told, you know.

273
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:44,696
If I died, so be it.

274
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,866
My life wasn't very hunky
dory at that time anyway.

275
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,369
Uh.

276
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:56,940
But I'm glad I made it. I met
my wife a couple of years later.

277
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,463
I hope I get to meet
my wife some day.

278
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:06,158
She was the sweetest
woman in the world.

279
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,807
And the lord took her away
from me much too soon.

280
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:17,627
Oh... I'm sorry.

281
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,359
So. Um, about the surgery...

282
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:28,156
So they're gonna cut a piece of tissue
out of your mouth and send it to the lab.

283
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:33,161
Then they're gonna create an airway by making
an opening in your trachea so you can breathe.

284
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:37,623
Ya I know, the surgeons told
me everything about it earlier.

285
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:42,152
Alright, well just making sure.

286
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:50,029
Now, be honest with me, what are your
thoughts on this? Is it the big C?

287
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:00,045
Yes, that's what
they're thinking.

288
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:01,774
Figures!

289
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:07,236
But hey, it's not a death
sentence by any means and

290
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,097
at least you didn't get it
when you were younger. Right?

291
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,075
Maybe I should have.

292
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,017
Why?

293
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:19,314
I would've treated every
day like it was my last.

294
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:24,712
Eat well, more meth
addicts await us.

295
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,697
I like meth addicts.
Good for business.

296
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:34,055
Tell me Ron, what do you
want out of life right now.

297
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,266
I'm not talking about helping people
and all that other B.S. but...

298
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,060
What do you really want?

299
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,603
Women, of course.

300
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,588
Oh! My bad!

301
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,485
What do you want Allen?

302
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,153
I want to get the
hell outta this place.

303
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,054
Well, good luck.

304
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,683
See ya.

305
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,760
Well, I didn't realize that destiny
would give me a chance so soon.

306
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:13,678
Oh hi.

307
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,721
Lisa right?

308
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:17,890
Yes, that's right... I'm
sorry, I forgot your name.

309
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:18,642
Ron.

310
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:22,228
Oh that's right. I didn't
know you live up here?

311
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,397
Um, yah I...

312
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,716
I live in North Clovis. I'm
just out here grabbing some...

313
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,446
Oh.

314
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,780
What about you?

315
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,115
Just, feminine things.

316
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:38,453
No, no, I didn't mean like..
Where you... nevermind.

317
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:42,206
So you really live up
here in North Clovis?

318
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,168
Ya, I live in a house
near Nees Avenue.

319
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:49,422
Oh really... so are you
sharing it with someone?

320
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:53,801
You mean like do I have
roommates? No, it's all mine.

321
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:58,806
Wow, that's a
great part of town.

322
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:04,830
I mean it's the
best... but uhhmm,

323
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,129
how much more shopping
do you have left?

324
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,442
I am pretty much done.

325
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,903
Do you wanna go grab
coffee? Maybe, chat?

326
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:12,571
Sure.

327
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:14,655
Let me grab this for you.

328
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,140
Oh, I think I better get this.

329
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:24,582
So, after nursing school, one
of my uncles suddenly died

330
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:28,169
and I found out that he left me
all this money for some reason.

331
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:34,193
So I bought a house, a car,
invested the rest an ah, yeah.

332
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,348
I still have this passion for
nursing and taking care of people, so

333
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,559
kind of ending up in this job.

334
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,979
What about you? How Did
you become a social worker?

335
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:51,442
Well, sociology was an
easy major in college.

336
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,945
Makes sense.

337
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:59,969
Umm, tell me this, has a guy
ever cooked for you before?

338
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,663
Not enough times.

339
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:08,024
Well, uhh, would you allow me
to cook you dinner this weekend?

340
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:13,572
That is sweet. I think I'll
take you up on that offer.

341
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,953
Cheers!

342
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,897
Hey John, what room
is Jim Maple in?

343
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,858
Let's see... he's
in room 316 bed 1.

344
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:35,385
Ok. Thank you.

345
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:44,221
Hey, I know you can't talk now so I
brought you a pen and a pad. Alright.

346
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:56,382
I talked to you doctors and they are still waiting
for the biopsy result but I just wanted to say...

347
00:26:56,406 --> 00:27:01,453
I know your struggling and I know your
having a hard time but keep hope alive.

348
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,272
"PAIN IS SO BAD, I
WANT THINGS TO END."

349
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:15,818
Jim don't say that. You survived getting
shot in the war... you can survive this.

350
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,218
Don't give up.

351
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,951
"IF I SURVIVE, WHAT KIND
OF LIFE WOULD I LIVE?"

352
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,495
Nobody knows what the
future holds. Right?

353
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:32,084
But medicine and technology are changing
all the time. Who knows what can happen?

354
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,818
You got to keep the faith.

355
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,049
Ok, enough.

356
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:42,219
I need to get some rest and

357
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:46,915
keep thinking those
positive thoughts. Alright.

358
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:51,795
I'll ask the nurse to
give you some pain meds.

359
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:13,060
So um, why did you become an
Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon?

360
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:19,757
Uhmm, well love, money,

361
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,677
women,

362
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:26,847
helping people,
challenging myself

363
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:31,310
all of those things, not
in that particular order

364
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:35,505
lets not talk about that. Why
don't we play a little game.

365
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,235
Let's!

366
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:44,259
Ok. The game is called the getting to
know each other better game. Alright,

367
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,700
this is how it works.

368
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:50,413
I will tell you something about
myself which may be true or false

369
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:56,085
and you have to guess. If you
get it right, you go again.

370
00:28:56,109 --> 00:29:00,172
If you get it wrong, you have to
tell me something about yourself

371
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,967
and I have to guess
whether it's true or false.

372
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,468
Ok.

373
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,678
Alright,

374
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,305
alright uumm,

375
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:11,291
true or false,

376
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:17,338
when I when I was ten years
old, I shaved my entire body.

377
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,693
Let me see,

378
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:24,488
hmmm,

379
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:27,515
I'm gonna go false on this one.

380
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,035
True, actually.

381
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:34,582
I went through puberty
really young and I...

382
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:40,278
I didn't like it and one day I went
to town with my mother's razor.

383
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,590
Ardy, that's crazy!

384
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,574
Ya, I know.

385
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,161
Ok, your turn.

386
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:54,000
Ok. I've kissed a girl before.

387
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,314
That's false.

388
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:02,258
Yes. But what made
you guess right?

389
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:08,365
Uhmm well, you're bold,
but not that bold.

390
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:12,936
Plus, I can tell that
you only really like men.

391
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:20,896
Ok. Uhmm, I guess
I have to go again.

392
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:28,529
Uhmm, I have tried
marijuana before.

393
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:34,642
True. I don't think you use it
on a regular basis but you ah

394
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,102
you definitely,
experimented in college,

395
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:40,380
and you definitely
inhaled. For sure.

396
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:45,593
Yes, Ardy, you're
too smart for me.

397
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,763
Hey, your turn
again, go ahead...

398
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,155
Hey buddy.

399
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,157
What's up?

400
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:36,954
I love this job. Shit, vomit, and piss. All
day, every day. It just gets better and better.

401
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,831
Stop complaining,
we're helping people.

402
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,876
Yah... How about helping myself.

403
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,654
Dude, we do all the crap work,
literally, get none of the credit.

404
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,467
Anyway, what are you
doing this weekend?

405
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:54,847
I got a date with
the social worker.

406
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,123
The social worker, yah!

407
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,043
Wow man, how did
you pull that off?

408
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:05,190
So, I got exterminators at my house right, so I am
staying over this guy's house named Josh Bergeman.

409
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,901
Uh, he's a lawyer. So...

410
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,237
He's the hot shot drunk driving
defense attorney? Josh Bergeman.

411
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,239
Ya, with the billboards. Ya.

412
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,616
How do you know
him? He's loaded.

413
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,869
We were friends growing up.
He lived in the neighborhood.

414
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:20,748
These kids would always
pick on him. One day, I like

415
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:24,460
stood up for him and shoved this kid
and we've been friends since then.

416
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,503
Anyway...

417
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:29,506
You lucky dog!

418
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,843
Listen, I bump into her
at a store near his house.

419
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,553
We talk.

420
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:37,306
She asks if I live in the area.

421
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,184
I might have told her
I live in the area.

422
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:44,271
I might have told her I inherited
a lot of money from my family.

423
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:48,192
And I definitely invited
to have dinner at my house,

424
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,510
Josh Bergemen's house.

425
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,308
You're lying to this
girl so you can bang her?

426
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,580
Girl's lie to me all the time.

427
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:05,167
Uh... No. One girl
lied to you many times.

428
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:07,294
Now you gotta take that
out on the whole world?

429
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:12,508
What?...T-T-the walking penis
is now on a moral high horse?

430
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,385
I got a date didn't I?

431
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,179
No, no no, doesn't
count. You cheated.

432
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,306
What are you talking about?

433
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,956
You cheated.

434
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:35,382
Her mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Her father
is an alcoholic, but she denies having any physical abuse

435
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:42,055
she describes having symptoms of major depression. She was
crying all the time, she felt tired, she lost fifteen pounds.

436
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:48,127
This episode happened after she broke up
with her boyfriend, when she turned fifteen.

437
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:54,151
Apparently, she was very attached to him. They had been going out
for eight months but, according to her, he left her for another girl.

438
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:56,969
Uhh, did they have sex?

439
00:33:56,993 --> 00:34:02,993
Yes, she admitted to that. Then, her dad went on a
drinking spree and didn't come home for several days.

440
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,895
Uh. What's the relationship
like of her parents now?

441
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,189
They are separated now.

442
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,483
OK what's her affect like?

443
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,111
She's reserved and
quiet, but not catatonic.

444
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,487
Ok, what about her meds?

445
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:21,225
She got started on Fluexetine, one month ago. I
don't know if it had enough time to take effect.

446
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:29,233
Hey, it's been really busy
this week at the hospital.

447
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,211
What are you doing tonight?

448
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,338
Well, I've got a date.

449
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,007
Who is it?

450
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,759
He's this nurse at the hospital.

451
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,010
A nurse?

452
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:43,682
Ya, but he's cute and he tells me
he inherited money from his family.

453
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:49,104
Ok, but it's funny, you work with all these
doctors and you're going out with a nurse...

454
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,190
Well have a good time.

455
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:54,443
So let me ask you something, do
you think I should sleep with him.

456
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,321
Depends on where he
takes you for dinner...

457
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,949
Just kidding. Just go
and see what happens.

458
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:03,118
But have him wear
a condom if you do.

459
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:06,872
Ok, hun, I will let
you know how it goes.

460
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:07,939
Bye.

461
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,690
Bye.

462
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:39,524
No so apparently there was a Rolling Stones concert in Berlin and these
balloons got released and they were floating towards the eastern side.

463
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:47,449
Um, and there was a member of the band named Nena in the audience
and he saw all the balloons floating towards the Soviet side

464
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:54,313
and they thought what if the Soviets start
military action and that starts the World War III.

465
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:58,358
That is what the song "99
Luft Balloons" is..is about.

466
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,110
Wow, that's crazy.

467
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,154
I know.

468
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:03,971
But I thought the whole
country of Germany was divided.

469
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,491
It was. So was the
city of Berlin.

470
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:10,954
So, Berlin was a divided city
within a divided country?

471
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:11,873
Exactly...

472
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,522
Ooh...

473
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,860
Have you ever listened to
the band named "Berlin"?

474
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,256
No.

475
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,882
I'm sure you heard one song.

476
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,575
Ok, which one?

477
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,037
"Take My Breath Away"
from the movie "Top Gun".

478
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:33,602
Yes, I know that
song. I love it.

479
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,920
Ron, how do you know
all these things?

480
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:40,943
I don't know, just childhood.

481
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,028
How's your food?

482
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:47,223
Oh, it's great.
Thank you so much.

483
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,207
More wine?

484
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,316
Oh yes. Please.

485
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,626
Hi, you reached the Josh
Bergeman residence...

486
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,606
Hey, is everything ok in there?

487
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,567
Ya ya, just a little accident.

488
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:23,777
Do you need any help?

489
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,636
No, it's ok.

490
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:40,919
You know Ron, I really
appreciate this.

491
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:45,072
To be honest, no other guy has
cooked dinner for me before.

492
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,228
Thank you.

493
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,545
Sure.

494
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:05,944
I didn't even know houses
like this exist in Fresno.

495
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,970
When did you end up buy it?

496
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,140
Uhmm, four years ago?

497
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,561
Don't you ever get lonely
in this big ol house?

498
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:19,857
Well, I'm hoping the situation
will change on that front.

499
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,819
Hmmm! Really?

500
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:28,467
The hardest part about the
house is maintaining it.

501
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,470
You have to have a gardener
and a pool man and...

502
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,972
Wait, you have a pool too!

503
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:38,292
Yah, pool and a guest house.
I should give you a tour!

504
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,565
Let's go over there.

505
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:46,943
Well, why don't we sit on the couch
for a little bit and drink some wine.

506
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,387
Wait, maybe not this one.
Let's just go over there.

507
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,239
Let me... let me just take this.

508
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,463
Oh.

509
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:53,825
Here?

510
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,049
Yeah.

511
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,939
Ahhh... um huh.

512
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,530
Huh.

513
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:16,038
So I can't believe that no
guy has ever cooked for you.

514
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:21,269
Gentlemen don't exist anymore

515
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:24,672
well, expect for you.

516
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:38,394
About that tour, you wanna make
the first stop in the bedroom?

517
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,666
Um.

518
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:48,130
Listen Lisa, it's been a great night
but, maybe we don't rush things, maybe...

519
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,339
Wow!

520
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,549
There'll be other
nights for more.

521
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,385
Ron, you are a gentleman.

522
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:58,473
Most guys just wanna get in
my pants as fast as possible.

523
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,291
You are special!

524
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:16,223
Hey man, is Jim
Maple still in 316?

525
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,893
Yes, he is.

526
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,352
Thanks.

527
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:28,110
Hey, Jim how are you?...I
brought you something.

528
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,324
Check this out.

529
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,403
What do you think?

530
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,198
"THANK YOU. I'M SO HAPPY. MY DOCTOR SAYS
THE CHEMO TREATMENT SEEMS TO BE WORKING!"

531
00:41:56,222 --> 00:42:00,351
That's great news. See, I told
you to stay positive right!

532
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,980
Ok, well, take a look.

533
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,652
Huh, Looks good!

534
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,998
"HOW IS THE THE GIRL
OF YOUR DREAMS?"

535
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:30,291
Huh, let's just say there's
some uh, heavy competition now.

536
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,978
"DON'T GIVE UP. A WISE
PERSON ONCE TOLD ME THAT!"

537
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:52,111
I won't... I won't.

538
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,775
Susan?

539
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,217
Yeeesss.

540
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,845
How did you know I was on call?

541
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,906
I have my ways.

542
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,033
How did you know I was here.

543
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:22,474
I have my ways.

544
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,580
So your gonna keep
interrogating me

545
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,356
or you gonna enjoy the
fact that I'm here?

546
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:34,462
It's always great to see you but
it's the middle of the night.

547
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:37,591
Well, if it's too
late, I can leave.

548
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:42,411
Residency is hard enough
but torturing me like this?

549
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:48,435
Get that grin off your face. But
seriously, what if someone comes in?

550
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,520
The door is locked.

551
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,606
What if I get called in?

552
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,940
You can pull out.

553
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,026
What?

554
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:58,945
I'm just kidding. I'm not gonna
have sex with you in the call room.

555
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,573
A couple of minutes ago
I was in deep sleep.

556
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,617
Sex was the last
thing on my mind.

557
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:07,871
That's only because you weren't
awake and you weren't dreaming.

558
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:11,207
Midnight comedian,
ehh. You're funny.

559
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:11,916
Ardy...

560
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,044
What?

561
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:14,943
Shut up and kiss me.

562
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:27,515
Urine and feces, and blood oh my.
Urine and feces and blood oh my...

563
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:30,477
So Ronny, how the
ladies treating you?

564
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,855
Well, huh, you can say
it's the dry season.

565
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:36,816
What about that hot ass social
worker you were scamming?

566
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,528
I made her dinner and
everything at Bergmen's house.

567
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:45,575
She was falling for me,
ready to go and um...

568
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,103
Then your ass gave me a conscious
and so I didn't go through with it.

569
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:54,793
Well cheer up sunny boy cause I got two
tickets this Saturday night Selland Arena.

570
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:57,837
There is a local alternative band
playing and they are pretty good.

571
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:00,590
I have my reservations
about alternative bands.

572
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:03,927
It's just corporate America
using the guise of grunge.

573
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:08,890
No, I mean some of these bands are pretty good you
know, it's not just about big hair, big tits, big ass.

574
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:13,144
Well, I'm sure their nobility will
lead them to their untimely deaths

575
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:15,563
as no good deed goes unpunished.

576
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:19,317
I just wanna blow off some steam for a couple
of hours and get the hell outta the hospital.

577
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:21,820
Are you trying to channel
in your inner Kurt Cobain?

578
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,697
The way you make it sound, like

579
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,282
have you ever considered
leaving this marriage?

580
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:30,602
And do what, go home home sit on the
couch, masturbate? Doesn't pay the bills.

581
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:37,228
So, there was this guy in the hospital and he was selling
these tubes with what looks like a penis head attached to them.

582
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:42,531
So... he said it's gonna revolutionize
intubations and airway management.

583
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:50,098
So, you want me to be a sales rep for
something that looks like a penis?

584
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:53,059
Isn't that what you already
do in your real life?

585
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,794
Uh ho! If its so great,
why don't you sell em?

586
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,716
I like my job.

587
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:06,364
This looks like superficial
abrasion, just needs moist dressing.

588
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,598
Ok?

589
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:10,618
Ron, there is a Jim
Maple here to see you.

590
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:11,935
Thank you.

591
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,302
Jim?

592
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:19,568
You... you look all swollen!

593
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:32,956
Ron, can I have a word with
you for a moment right in here?

594
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:33,725
Ya, sure.

595
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:34,949
Ok.

596
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:43,026
I know you have a close
connection with that patient,

597
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:48,740
but I wanna let you know, it
doesn't look good for him.

598
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:53,536
I recommend you keep your
distance and face the facts.

599
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:59,560
Severe cervical lymphadenopathy
indicates dissemination of oral cancer.

600
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:03,254
I'm sorry,

601
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:07,658
but hey, we've all
got to go someday.

602
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:12,847
I, I'm not sure I can do that.

603
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:18,436
Why Ron? Forty to fifty
thousand people die everyday

604
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:21,463
and none of them complain.

605
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:27,594
Because through dying,
I'm learning how to live.

606
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:43,044
So we performed a trach on
her to establish an airway.

607
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:47,257
In the ICU, she developed
Reiter's syndrome.

608
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:50,993
Dr. Pir, do you know the three
classic signs of Reiter's syndrome?

609
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:55,890
Uhmm... Uveitis,
conjunctivitis, and arthralgia.

610
00:47:55,914 --> 00:48:01,879
Good. Now the disease has a different
name. Do you know what it's called?

611
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:04,816
Reactive arthritis.

612
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,635
Good. Do you know
why it has two names?

613
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:17,352
No, I don't.

614
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:28,590
The disease was identified
by Hans Conrad Julius Reiter.

615
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:33,803
He was a Nazi with the Third Reich
and he performed human experiments.

616
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:38,975
The name was changed to
disband the affiliation.

617
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:44,999
Sometimes, you see, even
medicine has a, an evil side.

618
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:07,837
But now we will discuss
less severe sins.

619
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:13,509
However, we have all been guilty of
these sins when treating patients.

620
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:19,533
What I am talking about
here are sins of laziness,

621
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:24,312
and the sins of pride.

622
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:30,092
Both can have dire
consequences for patients.

623
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,721
Hey Dr. Pir.

624
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,241
Hey what's up my man.

625
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:40,227
You seem deep in thought.
What is it. Whose the girl?

626
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:41,455
No girl.

627
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:42,956
What is it then?

628
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,458
I was attending a
lecture today. And

629
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:48,294
the guy was comparing the
sins that the Nazis made

630
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,546
to the sins that residents make.

631
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:53,257
What? What a freak!

632
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:55,927
Ya,

633
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,286
but it got me thinking of my ex.

634
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,557
So, I was right.
It is about a girl.

635
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:02,559
You got me.

636
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:05,544
Always is. So what happened.

637
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:10,024
I had a problem with
her being Jewish and

638
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:13,945
broke it off with her because she lived
in LA and I was moving to Fresno and

639
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:17,222
told her I couldn't handle
the whole long distance thing.

640
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:22,811
Well, you did what you had to do at the
time and what you thought would be best.

641
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:26,082
Ya, but now I miss
her like crazy.

642
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:30,086
Aren't you and that fine drug rep hitting it
off. I mean, I see you two together all the time.

643
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,380
Ya, we're doing fine and...

644
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:35,466
So what's wrong?

645
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,719
Just miss that Jewish
girl like crazy.

646
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:40,054
Why don't you try to see if you
could get back together with her.

647
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:42,557
Knowing her, she probably
has a boyfriend by now.

648
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:47,228
Tough life. We'll if you guys get back
together, send the drug rep my way alright?

649
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:50,213
Will do man.

650
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,119
Are you having a good time babe?

651
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,121
It's always good to be
out of the hospital.

652
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:08,106
Well, honey, I am so
happy to be here with you.

653
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,835
Thanks.

654
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,319
Let's get another drink?

655
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:18,492
We better not. It's getting late and
I have an early morning tomorrow.

656
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,995
Oh, come on Ardy,
have a little fun.

657
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,307
Remember, we talked about this?

658
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:28,269
Oh yah, I know. Sins of
laziness and sins of pride.

659
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:32,356
Good. You don't want anyone
dying on me now do you?

660
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:35,610
Ok, Dr. Drama.

661
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:38,386
But how about we go
out for one last dance?

662
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:41,431
Alright, one last dance.

663
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:07,225
Hey.

664
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:13,249
Well, Mr. Maple's condition has worsened
so they took him to the ICU last night.

665
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:19,380
Yeah they found a mucocele on his trach
tube but the nurses suctioned it out.

666
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:25,678
Ya, mm hum. Ok, alright.
I'll see you there.

667
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:41,199
Oh, shit I thought you
said the door was locked!

668
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:59,360
I called your son today to let
him know that you may be passing.

669
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:05,384
He almost crashed his car rushing
to get over here to see you.

670
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:08,685
That boy really loves you.

671
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:16,252
Who am I kidding? I called.

672
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:20,614
He said he has
work, can't make it.

673
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:27,722
In fact, I was gonna come see
you before you passed, but

674
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:33,043
I got stuck with a patient.
So technically you died alone.

675
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:44,846
They say life is a bitch and then
you die. Well, you proved it.

676
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:54,564
Let's hope you're in a better
place buddy, let's hope...

677
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:56,251
Hi, you have reached Ron, please
leave a message after the beep.

678
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,357
Hi, Ron, this is Lisa.

679
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,235
I'm just calling to
see how you're doing.

680
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:08,572
So I haven't really heard from
you since we last hung out

681
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:13,995
and I'm really hoping your not judging me
based on what you saw in the film room.

682
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:20,019
So please give me a call when you get
a chance. Okay, you take care. Bye.

683
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,122
Hey Dr. Pir.

684
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,249
Good morning.

685
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:00,875
What are you up to?

686
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:04,378
I just finished my night of call and
going out of town for the weekend.

687
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:05,213
Oh, where you headed?

688
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:06,630
LA.

689
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:09,508
That's like a three and a half hour
drive... Are you going right now?

690
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:10,885
Ya, I am.

691
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,511
Man you're gonna fall
asleep behind the wheel.

692
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,180
Na, I'll be alright.

693
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:17,683
Alright well, be safe.
Nothing good happens in LA.

694
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:20,061
Don't want to see you wind
up in our emergency room.

695
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,063
Huh! You won't.

696
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,981
Maybe you'll bump into
your old flame down there.

697
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:25,274
I doubt it.

698
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:26,233
Alright, see ya man.

699
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:27,457
Later man.

700
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:55,662
Ron! Ron!

701
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:56,681
Hey.

702
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,974
Hey, how are you?

703
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:02,311
What's wrong? Why are
you trying to ignore me?

704
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:05,773
Look Lisa, maybe what happened the
other night wasn't a good idea.

705
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,900
Why? I had a good time.

706
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,861
Listen Lisa... I'm not rich.

707
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,614
The house you had
dinner at, not my house.

708
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:18,160
The car you saw in the driveway, it's not
my car. My friend just owed me a favor.

709
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,955
And that inheritance
thing... it's all a lie.

710
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,874
You son of a bitch!
So you lied to me.

711
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:26,836
Be honest. Would you have gone out with me if
you thought I was earning a nurse's salary?

712
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,921
So, you lied to get in my pants?

713
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:31,632
Nothing happened, remember?
We didn't have sex.

714
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:32,716
I didn't deserve
to... I'm not rich.

715
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:33,301
You're an asshole!

716
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:35,743
Well, Lisa, you're
a gold-digger.

717
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:42,953
Look I... thank you for the
greeting, have a good day.

718
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:45,702
Ron...

719
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:48,858
I thought we had
something the other night.

720
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,067
What?

721
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:53,904
The night at your house
or your pseudo house.

722
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:56,890
What about that doctor you were
just screwin' in the film room.

723
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,786
He wasn't serious. He
just wanted some fun.

724
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:04,957
Lisa, let me be very
straight forward with you.

725
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:09,986
I never intending on anything
else but just fun with you either.

726
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:13,531
I'm sorry.

727
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:36,822
She a fine young looking thing,
ain't she? And you're staring again.

728
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:40,159
Yuhh, man I'm crazy about her.

729
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,410
How far have you gotten?

730
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:44,371
Nothing, nada, zilch!

731
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:45,748
You suck, Ron!

732
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,666
I know. It's shameful.

733
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:52,213
Ya... Come on man.
Take a risk, huh.

734
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:55,591
Stop being such a
vaginus maximus.

735
00:58:55,615 --> 00:59:00,411
Life is but a crap shoot, the
predictable ending for us all, anyways.

736
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:02,974
I'm gonna go change.

737
00:59:02,998 --> 00:59:04,290
Ya.

738
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:19,031
Gawd, you even make
drinking coffee look hot.

739
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,617
Ron, you're nuts!

740
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:22,494
What's up?

741
00:59:22,518 --> 00:59:25,454
Nothing, just
about to head home.

742
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:30,608
Ya, my shift is over as well...
It's a nice day today, huh?

743
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:38,676
You wanna go to the fair.
It's right around the corner.

744
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,177
Right now?

745
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:43,138
Yeah, come on. It'll be fun.

746
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:44,723
I really shouldn't.

747
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:49,144
Come on. It's the fair.
Its once a year. Come on.

748
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:54,191
They have cotton candy and
merry go rounds. Come on.

749
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:55,943
What am I, four years old?

750
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,760
You can be for a little bit.

751
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:04,601
Fine you convinced
me, let me go change.

752
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:31,080
Ardy came all the way here
tonight for my birthday.

753
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:32,748
Uh, it's not a big deal man.

754
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:37,294
I mean LA has riots, floods,
fires, and earthquakes. But,

755
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:39,296
I'll still take it over Fresno.

756
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,988
I'll drink to that!

757
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,234
Um!

758
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:52,393
I didn't tell her you'd be here but I
wasn't expecting her to bring a date.

759
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:54,836
No worries, man.

760
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:56,963
Hey!

761
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,400
Good to see you.

762
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:00,925
Hi, how are you?
Good to see you.

763
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:03,278
Hello.

764
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:06,264
Hi, how are you?

765
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:09,118
Hi, nice to see you.

766
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,411
Umm, This is...

767
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:13,330
Hi I am Steve, nice to meet you.

768
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:14,416
Likewise.

769
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,898
Hola.

770
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,879
So uh, you're on time as usual.

771
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,131
Yes... um.

772
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,532
Waiting for us or what?

773
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:27,076
Yeah... exactly.

774
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:33,750
Mmm.

775
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:37,211
Not bad.

776
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:42,216
Supposed to just
take that and umm.

777
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:51,434
Don't be shy...

778
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:03,839
So how are things going in Fresno.
You're a hot shot oral surgeon now.

779
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:07,760
Oh, lets just say...
keeps me very busy.

780
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,344
What kind of stuff
have you seen?

781
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:11,513
Crazy things.

782
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:17,537
Umm, self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the face by
meth addicts who just broke up with their girlfriends.

783
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:22,399
You know fun stuff like
that. What about you?

784
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:24,651
Crazy, umm,

785
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:28,113
I have actually just been accepted
to the program in Fullerton.

786
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:28,947
Really?

787
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:29,657
Mmm Hmmm.

788
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:31,241
That's great.

789
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:33,118
I know how hard
you worked for it.

790
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:36,622
That's all you could talk
about while we were dating...

791
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:40,125
Jess, speaking of dating,

792
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:43,337
I don't remember
why we broke up?

793
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:46,840
I'm Jewish, remember?
It was your decision.

794
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:49,551
That's not an
issue. I'll convert.

795
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:51,744
I'm already circumscribed.

796
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:56,850
Ardy, you still have
your sense of humor.

797
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:59,269
I try.

798
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:01,688
Religion has never
an issue to me.

799
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:04,215
What about the distance
thing you kept mentioning.

800
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:13,635
At the time, I thought it was a
good idea. But, looking back at it,

801
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:17,079
I think I made a mistake.

802
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:22,984
And, I can't change the past
or control your happiness.

803
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,337
Hey,

804
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:26,046
Hi

805
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:27,270
I'm back!

806
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,676
I actually got to
get going but uh

807
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,095
gonna go say bye
to everybody. But

808
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,745
Steve, pleasure meeting you.

809
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:40,001
I just wanna let you know that
you got a great girl here.

810
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,713
What exactly do
mean by that DOCTOR?

811
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:47,150
I'm just saying that you
got a good girl, that's all.

812
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:50,136
Ya, I know... it's
gonna stay that way!

813
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:54,849
Ok.

814
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:26,023
Hello.

815
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:26,691
Jessica?

816
01:05:26,715 --> 01:05:29,735
Hey, Ardy what are you doing?

817
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:34,197
Well I drank, so I'm just
reminiscing by the pier.

818
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:37,284
Look Ardy, I wanna
apologize for Steve tonight.

819
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:41,270
He's an asshole. And it was
only our second date, so.

820
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:44,690
Ya uh, so are you
gonna see him again?

821
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:48,420
No, probably not.

822
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:53,032
Well that's good cause um... I
think we should get back together.

823
01:05:54,867 --> 01:06:00,599
So you think that you can just walk back into
my life like that after you broke up with me?

824
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:04,519
Ya... I mean, I'm gonna
give you a good life.

825
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:05,979
What happened?

826
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:10,817
The grass isn't greener or
Fresno Women aren't stacking up.

827
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:16,281
Look, I'm gonna be here for a couple of
days. Why don't we grab lunch tomorrow?

828
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:19,266
Ok, it's getting late.
Call me tomorrow, ok.

829
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:25,356
Ok, perfect. Alright,
have a good night.

830
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:03,578
Who is it?

831
01:07:03,602 --> 01:07:05,855
It's Susan.

832
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:23,098
Hey babe, what's up?
I got us ice cream.

833
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:24,498
Hey.

834
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:30,504
Thanks, that's nice.

835
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:36,635
Well, you don't seem excited
to see me. What's wrong?

836
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:43,350
Susan, I have to
tell you something.

837
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:48,522
What is it?

838
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:56,590
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

839
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:59,509
Bumped into my exgirlfriend
when I was back in LA and

840
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:01,994
decided to give it another shot.

841
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,562
Listen, Susan you
are an amazing...

842
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:12,355
Save it.

843
01:08:12,379 --> 01:08:14,858
I am the idiot here...

844
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:19,279
So, I was your flavor of the month
until you decided to be serious?

845
01:08:19,303 --> 01:08:22,240
It wasn't like that.
It just happened.

846
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:25,869
Oh ya, it just happened.

847
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:29,122
You know you're not
even a real surgeon.

848
01:08:29,146 --> 01:08:30,898
Go pull some teeth!

849
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:34,628
Susan, we can still be friends.

850
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:37,029
Oh, you're funny!

851
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:12,815
How yous doings?

852
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:16,294
Oh, come on... turn
that frown upside down.

853
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:18,088
Guys are assholes!

854
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:20,257
What?...what did I do?

855
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:21,299
Not you.

856
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:22,135
Then what?

857
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:27,514
Ardy and I were seeing each other and he
just left me to go back to his ex-girlfriend.

858
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:28,474
Dr. Pir?

859
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:30,416
Yes.

860
01:09:31,792 --> 01:09:36,356
Well you guys were just dating right?
Like, right, he wasn't your boyfriend?

861
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:39,359
I know, but I was
falling for him...

862
01:09:39,383 --> 01:09:44,096
Yuh, ok, uuhh so where
does that leave me?

863
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:48,493
What do you mean.
We're just friends.

864
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:54,517
Ya, I know, I have been your friend. But,
I don't wanna be just friends anymore.

865
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:58,712
You have to sleep with every
girl you hang out with?

866
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:04,736
No. No. It's not like that. But I can't just be friends with
you with all these feelings that I have. I mean, you know that.

867
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:10,557
Ron, you're a great guy...

868
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:13,185
Ya, ya, ya I get it,
ya. I'm a great guy.

869
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:15,896
I'm just not a doctor.
I'm a male nurse

870
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,523
who... who loves his
job and who works hard.

871
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:20,400
But that's not good enough, huh!

872
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:22,652
Oh, I get it.

873
01:10:22,676 --> 01:10:27,782
Ron's talking from
his almighty tower.

874
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:32,204
I know about you and your track record
with the girls from the hospital.

875
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:35,790
It's like you have your own
little Melrose Place here.

876
01:10:35,814 --> 01:10:41,046
Ya, that's ok. But when it comes
to me, now your the victim. Right?

877
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:44,531
Why can't I have what I
want, whoever it may be?

878
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:47,952
I'm outta here.

879
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:47,279
Hanab?

880
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,363
Dr. Pir?

881
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:49,030
Welcome.

882
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:50,254
Thank you.

883
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:54,744
So how are you liking it so far?

884
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:56,705
Not bad. Can't
complain too much.

885
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:59,106
Ya, did you meet the chief yet?

886
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:07,132
Good morning gentlemen. Like to welcome
Hanab to the team. Very excited to have you.

887
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:07,800
Thanks Chief.

888
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:11,886
Well, hopefully, this is the start to
a very exciting and enriching year.

889
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:14,747
That being said,
let's get to work.

890
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:19,936
Well, I just got called from the ER for a
patient with a submandibular space infection.

891
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:22,772
He is breathing ok, but they
want us to see him right away.

892
01:12:22,796 --> 01:12:25,299
Ok, lets head out,
see what we got.

893
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:56,497
Hi, uhmm yes, this is Ron, I
think you have the results.

894
01:13:04,004 --> 01:13:05,422
Ok.

895
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:10,469
Ya, thank you.

896
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:27,027
No, right now there is no impeding airway
but we would like it to go this morning.

897
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:33,700
Ok, within the hour?
Yeah, perfect, that works.

898
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:38,681
So Ardy, Monty wants you
to go in on this case.

899
01:13:38,705 --> 01:13:40,850
Sounds great.

900
01:13:40,874 --> 01:13:42,709
What's with you?

901
01:13:43,293 --> 01:13:47,089
I'm not last on the totem pole
anymore! There's people below me!

902
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:50,926
Congratulations. Now
go do this fuckin'case.

903
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:52,803
Alright.

904
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:57,465
Ardy!

905
01:13:58,225 --> 01:13:59,161
Ya.

906
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:01,996
Make sure you have a nurse
help you with the pre op.

907
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:04,189
Sure thing.

908
01:14:08,193 --> 01:14:09,712
Mind helping me out with
something really quick!

909
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:10,798
Yes, sure doctor.

910
01:14:10,822 --> 01:14:16,803
You know that patient with the neck abscess. Can you give
him Unasyn 3 grams IV and can you witness a consent for me?

911
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:21,832
Um, I've already seen him. He's allergic to
Penicillin so started him on Clindamycin.

912
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,752
Ok... Uhh, can you help
me with the consent then?

913
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:28,380
Ya, sure.

914
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:35,882
So we will make an incision in your neck right
below the jaw line, um to drain the infection.

915
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:40,535
While we're there, we will place
cultures in the area to see what bugs are

916
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:46,559
and with an instrument I will dissect the floor
of your mouth and place rubber drains there

917
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:53,149
um, in order to proceed I will need you to
sign this consent form right where the X is.

918
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:04,041
Thank you, and Ron if you can sign
the witness line for me please.

919
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:07,836
Thank you.

920
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:13,592
Hello... Hi Honey.

921
01:15:17,137 --> 01:15:23,137
Ya, I'm fine. Same ol, same ol... sick
patients, long shifts, mean doctors.

922
01:15:24,561 --> 01:15:28,249
Well, just take of
yourself and eat well,

923
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:34,238
and remember, you can't solve
all the world's problems.

924
01:15:37,115 --> 01:15:39,826
So how you holding up?

925
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:44,623
I'm fine Mom, thank
you. Love you.

926
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:48,085
I love you too.

927
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:53,900
Mom? I...

928
01:15:53,924 --> 01:15:56,885
Yes dear.

929
01:15:59,263 --> 01:16:00,823
Honey?

930
01:16:00,847 --> 01:16:02,033
How... how's dad doing?

931
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:08,057
Ohh. He's fine. Same ol, same ol. Is
that really what you wanted to ask me?

932
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:13,517
Yes.

933
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:16,989
Are you sure?

934
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:22,160
Yes mom. Love you.

935
01:16:23,328 --> 01:16:26,832
I love you too. Bye honey.

936
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:28,875
Bye.

937
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:55,569
Looks like his sedation
is wearing off.

938
01:16:58,905 --> 01:17:00,105
Please stop moving.

939
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:03,651
Just bear with us.

940
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:06,163
Come on sir, don't
move. Please, sir.

941
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:11,728
He's gonna need more sedation.

942
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:17,007
Can you give him two more milliliters of
Versed, I'm gonna give him some local.

943
01:17:26,683 --> 01:17:28,852
Hand me the 15 please.

944
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:38,945
Let's ahh... finish
closing this.

945
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:51,708
Good. Were' just about done
and he's still sedated.

946
01:17:54,711 --> 01:17:56,338
Looks good.

947
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:10,102
Hey!

948
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:10,787
Hey!

949
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:12,011
Good to see you.

950
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:13,331
Good to see you.

951
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:14,249
Where's my brother?

952
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:17,901
He's in the back with the little
monster. He'll be out. Come in.

953
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:21,089
How've you been?

954
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:23,115
Yeh.

955
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:28,262
So uh, you dating anybody?

956
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:31,206
It's complicated, as
everything else in my life.

957
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:35,585
Well, you can tell
me, Ron. I am family.

958
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:40,733
Remember Amy from high school?

959
01:18:40,757 --> 01:18:42,443
Yes.

960
01:18:42,467 --> 01:18:46,430
So, we get together.
She's a hooker now

961
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:54,557
um, had a chance to score with a gold digger and
the girl of my dreams just wants to be friends.

962
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:01,153
Friends? Like the show?

963
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:07,552
Like, not even friends with
benefits. Just friends.

964
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:09,846
Damn,

965
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:15,768
seriously. You need to find yourself
a partner. Not just a score.

966
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:21,441
Ya, but it's not easy
with... with my job.

967
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:24,426
Cause I'm always reminded
of how short life is.

968
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:28,322
Well life doesn't have to
be long to be meaningful.

969
01:19:28,346 --> 01:19:31,516
I mean everyday you help people
when they need it the most.

970
01:19:35,228 --> 01:19:39,608
That makes sense.
Something to think about.

971
01:19:40,525 --> 01:19:41,627
Ya.

972
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:42,486
Hey!

973
01:19:42,819 --> 01:19:44,696
Hey.

974
01:19:45,363 --> 01:19:46,549
How's it going?

975
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:48,342
Uhh, same ol, same ol.

976
01:19:48,366 --> 01:19:49,470
How's dad?

977
01:19:49,494 --> 01:19:53,371
You know pops, he's only
happy when we're all together.

978
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:58,543
Oh my goodness! Come
here you little princess!

979
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:23,127
Don't fall for any jerks lies.

980
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:24,087
What?

981
01:20:24,111 --> 01:20:27,572
Too cute. She's gonna be
a little heartbreaker.

982
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:42,314
Dr. J?

983
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:44,673
Ah, take a seat doctor Dr. Pir.

984
01:20:50,595 --> 01:20:54,867
So... after uh going
over your evaluations, uh

985
01:20:54,891 --> 01:21:00,891
it appears that your knowledge of the basic
material started slow but it's definitely improving.

986
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:05,253
Your hand and surgical
skills are there.

987
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:08,422
Motivation, eagerness
to learn is good.

988
01:21:08,446 --> 01:21:10,675
Bedside manner, relatively good.

989
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:16,699
Um, there were a few inconsequential complaints from patients but I think,
both you and I know, that sometimes patients can have their own agenda.

990
01:21:19,624 --> 01:21:21,435
Professional demeanor.

991
01:21:21,459 --> 01:21:23,521
The staff thinks your nice.

992
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:28,526
It does say here you can be clownish and
eccentric at times, that's not an issue.

993
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:29,902
Oh and Ardy...

994
01:21:29,926 --> 01:21:30,654
Yes.

995
01:21:30,678 --> 01:21:32,989
Be careful when you date
people in the hospital.

996
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:36,367
That's all over now. You don't
need to worry about that.

997
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:37,591
Ok.

998
01:21:37,642 --> 01:21:41,414
Listen, there's just one more issue I
wanna address before I let you go... um.

999
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:47,438
Do you wanna explain why you felt the need to staple a
patient's forehead in the shape of a Jewish star of David?

1000
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:54,904
It was a stellate lac. He needed some advancement
flaps and revisions and it just turned out that way.

1001
01:21:57,329 --> 01:22:00,016
Ardy! Cut the crap.

1002
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:03,811
And he had a large swastika
tattoo on his chest.

1003
01:22:03,835 --> 01:22:06,004
I think he deserved it.

1004
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:09,150
He can have a scar
revision in six months.

1005
01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:15,174
Well, I don't think a three time convicted drunk driver
with a history of meth addiction is going to ask for that.

1006
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:17,575
Alright listen up, Ardy.

1007
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:21,913
You and I both know that
Fresno is just a temporary stop

1008
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:26,125
before you move unto to bigger and
better things in LA. So do me a favor,

1009
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:31,029
stay out of trouble, just give me everything
you have when your here at Valley hospital. Ok?

1010
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:32,591
Sure thing doc.

1011
01:22:32,615 --> 01:22:34,592
Alright, keep up the good work.

1012
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:35,344
Thanks.

1013
01:22:35,368 --> 01:22:37,577
You bet. Go.

1014
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:46,795
Hey Susan!

1015
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:50,983
What now? You're gonna make
me feel like shit again?

1016
01:22:51,007 --> 01:22:54,153
Look, I just wanna
say I'm sorry.

1017
01:22:54,177 --> 01:22:59,325
Half of it was the rage I have against
the world and the other half was the

1018
01:22:59,349 --> 01:23:00,993
the broken heart talking.

1019
01:23:01,017 --> 01:23:04,288
I... I just felt that after the fair
that we had a connection and you know...

1020
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:07,416
Ron, I do like
you as a friend...

1021
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:12,421
I know, I know, just not in that
way. And I have to accept that.

1022
01:23:12,445 --> 01:23:15,549
I did have a good time
at the fair though.

1023
01:23:15,573 --> 01:23:19,345
Ya, it was fun.

1024
01:23:19,369 --> 01:23:22,330
That's why I want us
to remain friends.

1025
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:05,540
Hey.

1026
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:07,032
Hey.

1027
01:24:08,168 --> 01:24:13,190
Oh hey, don't worry about
it. I'm just not feeling it.

1028
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:14,758
You wanna just hang out tonight?

1029
01:24:16,676 --> 01:24:17,654
What's wrong?

1030
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:20,096
Nothing, just not feeling it.

1031
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:27,937
OK

1032
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:33,359
Look, you'll still get paid anyway...
Just take a break from sex tonight.

1033
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:36,488
Aren't you a gentleman.

1034
01:24:56,841 --> 01:24:59,052
How are you doing?
How's your kid?

1035
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:03,032
Didn't know I was
getting paid to talk.

1036
01:25:03,056 --> 01:25:07,811
Well, I paid for this time
so I can do what I want.

1037
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:17,606
You know, I... remember you
being quiet and shy in school.

1038
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:18,548
Huh.

1039
01:25:18,572 --> 01:25:20,907
Would never imagine
you doing this.

1040
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,369
Well.

1041
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:32,877
I don't know. It's the
most pure and real thing.

1042
01:25:33,419 --> 01:25:35,523
What?

1043
01:25:35,547 --> 01:25:40,301
They want me for sex and I want them
for money. It's an honest transaction.

1044
01:25:40,802 --> 01:25:46,700
Ok, but purity aside, what's
gonna happen in five years.

1045
01:25:46,724 --> 01:25:52,724
I mean, do you want your daughter to find out? Kids in
school asking "what does your mom do?" What is she gonna say?

1046
01:25:54,691 --> 01:26:00,691
Well, she is gonna say that my dick-head dad left me before I was born
and my dick-head grandfather left my mom before she was a teenager.

1047
01:26:05,451 --> 01:26:11,451
Ya, but putting dick-head, poor male role models
aside, there's gotta be other ways of makin' money.

1048
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:22,171
Ya, you try raising a kid and paying for your
mom's hospital bills on a waitress' salary.

1049
01:26:28,808 --> 01:26:32,812
I just don't want you to catch
anything or get beaten one night.

1050
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:37,626
Know, I hate when my
clients try to be saints.

1051
01:26:37,650 --> 01:26:39,861
I'm your friend.

1052
01:26:42,655 --> 01:26:43,865
Ya.

1053
01:26:48,286 --> 01:26:53,893
Ok, well ah... I got to get
going, I got a long day tomorrow.

1054
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:55,585
Your money's on the counter.

1055
01:26:56,961 --> 01:26:58,296
Thanks.

1056
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:33,641
So you wanna take out all your
cash and close your account?

1057
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:36,328
Ya. Yes.

1058
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:40,064
Is there a reason? Can we do
something to improve our services?

1059
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:42,418
No, just a...

1060
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:44,336
Are you leaving us
for ICAN banking?

1061
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:49,490
No, no no, you guys are
fine. Ah... I'm moving.

1062
01:28:50,533 --> 01:28:54,746
Oh, ok, then how would
you like your cash?

1063
01:28:56,122 --> 01:29:00,686
Uuhmm, straight
hundreds would be fine.

1064
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:03,671
Alright, I'll be right back.

1065
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:26,003
Ok, well uh, here you...

1066
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:28,988
No, no wait!

1067
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:26,897
Ok. So, you're keepers
are a Bird/Magic rookie,

1068
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:32,569
the Jordan rookie, of course, the
Charles Barkley, and the Olajuwon.

1069
01:30:32,593 --> 01:30:35,906
You, ahh sure you
wanna get rid of these?

1070
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:37,682
Ya, I need the cash

1071
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:42,287
I'll give you um

1072
01:30:42,311 --> 01:30:44,897
five hundred for all of them.

1073
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:48,860
Five fifty and I throw in
a bunch of Shaq rookies.

1074
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:53,531
Shaq rookies?

1075
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:58,178
Ok..

1076
01:30:58,202 --> 01:31:02,307
This is the last thing. I'll
throw in the tape of Ejacula 2.

1077
01:31:02,331 --> 01:31:03,875
It has Ron Jeremy in it.

1078
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:05,853
Oh,

1079
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:08,254
that's clearly a copy.

1080
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:11,674
I didn't think authenticity
mattered in these cases.

1081
01:31:16,387 --> 01:31:18,389
Deal!

1082
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:23,162
Are you excited for you
first day of kindergarten?

1083
01:31:23,186 --> 01:31:25,247
I'm scared mommy.

1084
01:31:25,271 --> 01:31:27,374
Don't worry sweety,
you're gonna be just fine.

1085
01:31:27,398 --> 01:31:30,359
Mommy can you be
with me tonight?

1086
01:31:31,068 --> 01:31:32,945
You promised.

1087
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:34,906
Of course.

1088
01:31:36,782 --> 01:31:38,051
Thank you mommy.

1089
01:31:38,075 --> 01:31:39,869
Of course.

1090
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:45,601
Mommy read me something.
Read what's in your hands.

1091
01:31:45,625 --> 01:31:47,084
Ok.

1092
01:31:47,710 --> 01:31:51,756
Um, let's see what we got.

1093
01:31:53,007 --> 01:31:57,178
Ahh, you have ten
days until collections

1094
01:31:57,887 --> 01:31:59,722
let's not read that one.

1095
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:03,160
And

1096
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:06,729
eleven free CD's... boring.

1097
01:32:10,983 --> 01:32:13,569
Mommy, open the big
yellow envelope.

1098
01:32:30,294 --> 01:32:32,547
Mommy read it to me.

1099
01:32:34,465 --> 01:32:36,467
What's wrong mom?

1100
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:46,352
Oh, thanks.

1101
01:32:50,481 --> 01:32:53,210
Ok, everything seems
to be in the report.

1102
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:55,570
Good job, you can
have her come in.

1103
01:32:56,028 --> 01:33:00,241
Thank you, but Mrs. Sierakowski,
when can you do my papers?

1104
01:33:01,617 --> 01:33:04,579
I'll do it this week, I promise.

1105
01:33:04,787 --> 01:33:06,473
Thank you, I'll get her.

1106
01:33:06,497 --> 01:33:07,697
Thanks.

1107
01:33:15,464 --> 01:33:16,276
Amy.

1108
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:17,633
Hi.

1109
01:33:18,134 --> 01:33:19,319
Good morning.

1110
01:33:19,343 --> 01:33:19,988
You want coffee?

1111
01:33:20,012 --> 01:33:21,530
Um... I'm fine thank you.

1112
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:24,515
Great, sit down.

1113
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:28,370
So,

1114
01:33:28,394 --> 01:33:30,163
you think this plan will work?

1115
01:33:30,187 --> 01:33:33,041
Look, you were born in America.

1116
01:33:33,065 --> 01:33:35,335
You both went to the
same high school.

1117
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:38,964
I don't see it as a problem.
You have to trust me,

1118
01:33:38,988 --> 01:33:40,573
I'm a lawyer.

1119
01:33:41,365 --> 01:33:43,302
Ok.

1120
01:33:43,326 --> 01:33:46,287
Now, I need you to
sign this right here.

1121
01:33:49,999 --> 01:33:54,754
Congratulations. Now, all I need is his
signature and you guys are official.

1122
01:33:55,671 --> 01:33:57,465
Ok.

1123
01:34:00,676 --> 01:34:05,616
It's just, I never imagined
it being like this.

1124
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:09,411
Well, life tricks you in
certain unexpected ways.

1125
01:34:09,435 --> 01:34:11,103
You should know that by now.

1126
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:14,249
Ya, it's just he

1127
01:34:14,273 --> 01:34:18,277
he never mentioned any of this
during any of our outings.

1128
01:34:19,153 --> 01:34:20,613
Your outings?

1129
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:25,868
We... we didn't just have sex.

1130
01:34:36,003 --> 01:34:40,049
As his wife, I'm hear
to talk about Ron...

1131
01:34:58,150 --> 01:35:04,150
I'm sorry. I... I wrote a speech
but I can't go through with this.

1132
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:10,490
I just wanna say that with
the exception of my daughter,

1133
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:15,751
nobody has cared for
me more than Ron has.

1134
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:02,232
Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt,

1135
01:36:02,256 --> 01:36:05,485
you look really familiar. Have I seen
you around in the hospital at the Valley?

1136
01:36:05,509 --> 01:36:07,779
Ya, I use to do
social work there.

1137
01:36:07,803 --> 01:36:09,156
That's how you know Ron?

1138
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:12,242
Ya, we met a long time ago.

1139
01:36:12,266 --> 01:36:15,287
He actually got me
into the Peace Corps.

1140
01:36:15,311 --> 01:36:19,666
I just came back from an
assignment in Africa two weeks ago

1141
01:36:19,690 --> 01:36:21,710
and then I found out
about his passing.

1142
01:36:21,734 --> 01:36:24,546
Peace Corps in Africa?
That sounds eye opening

1143
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:30,570
I just needed a change in my life and Ron suggested
that it would be an incredible experience.

1144
01:36:31,535 --> 01:36:33,096
Interesting.

1145
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:35,891
You know, Ron is the reason
I met my wife, Susan.

1146
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:38,477
Ya, they were
really good friends.

1147
01:36:38,501 --> 01:36:42,022
He set us up while he was receiving
treatment at my clinic. He was

1148
01:36:42,046 --> 01:36:46,568
you know, losing hair and
growing weaker by the day, but

1149
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:48,320
insisted that I call her.

1150
01:36:48,344 --> 01:36:49,946
Is she here?

1151
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:54,785
No she's at home cause she's actually
due any day now for our first son.

1152
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:56,393
We're gonna name him after Ron.

1153
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:58,663
Well congratulations.

1154
01:36:58,687 --> 01:37:01,249
Thank you... We're
gonna greatly miss Ron.

1155
01:37:01,273 --> 01:37:02,733
Yeah.

1156
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:11,843
I never have to work
the streets again.

1157
01:37:11,867 --> 01:37:16,431
And my daughter's
college is paid for but,

1158
01:37:16,455 --> 01:37:18,725
I feel like crap.

1159
01:37:18,749 --> 01:37:24,213
Taking his life insurance
money makes me feel so empty.

1160
01:37:24,839 --> 01:37:27,192
He wanted you to have it.

1161
01:37:27,216 --> 01:37:30,654
It was his dying wish.

1162
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:36,678
There was a new chemo
drug called Temzolamide.

1163
01:37:37,184 --> 01:37:40,664
It would've given him a
couple more months but

1164
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:43,232
he refused to take it.

1165
01:37:46,193 --> 01:37:50,781
We uh, we used to have sex,
up until we got married.

1166
01:37:54,243 --> 01:37:56,453
You know, your marriage
was only on paper.

1167
01:37:57,288 --> 01:37:58,349
Um hum.

1168
01:37:58,373 --> 01:38:04,373
But he found a way for us to not have
to do what we don't want anymore.

1169
01:38:04,712 --> 01:38:07,673
Like we're free now.

1170
01:38:12,303 --> 01:38:14,739
How can I go on?

1171
01:38:14,763 --> 01:38:16,992
Take the money.

1172
01:38:17,016 --> 01:38:19,560
Start a new life, out of Fresno.

1173
01:38:29,278 --> 01:38:31,673
Oh ya, you're
feeling better now?

1174
01:38:31,697 --> 01:38:33,073
Good.

1175
01:38:35,534 --> 01:38:37,328
Oh ya, should be
home in a little bit.

1176
01:38:38,662 --> 01:38:42,750
Ok. I love you too. Bye.

1177
01:38:43,375 --> 01:38:45,186
Checking out the
beautiful scenery, huh!

1178
01:38:45,210 --> 01:38:49,482
Ya, you know it. What
was that all about?

1179
01:38:49,506 --> 01:38:53,194
Ah, it's just the pregnancy
has been really rough on Jess.

1180
01:38:53,218 --> 01:38:56,907
How's the residency
and hospital going now?

1181
01:38:56,931 --> 01:39:00,619
Gawd, I've been there so long
I've been institutionalized.

1182
01:39:00,643 --> 01:39:05,498
Oh! Uh, last week the hospital commemorated
a nurse that use to work there,

1183
01:39:05,522 --> 01:39:08,150
Ron Sierakowski.
Do you know him?

1184
01:39:08,984 --> 01:39:13,322
Ron? No, I don't.

1185
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:16,718
I guess he was there
when you were an intern.

1186
01:39:16,742 --> 01:39:20,829
But ya, he got sick
and he finally passed.

1187
01:39:21,205 --> 01:39:26,519
I do remember the super hot rep
when I was there that I dated.

1188
01:39:26,543 --> 01:39:28,480
I remember her.

1189
01:39:28,504 --> 01:39:33,526
May God rest his soul. How's
Dr. Hall running the asylum?

1190
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:36,512
You already know how that is.

1191
01:39:41,058 --> 01:39:45,622
So uhh, the job search? How's that going?
You've been up and down LA for awhile now?

1192
01:39:45,646 --> 01:39:48,041
Ya, it's funny that
you mention that. Uhmm,

1193
01:39:48,065 --> 01:39:51,169
Dr. A might have a position
open for me in Fresno.

1194
01:39:51,193 --> 01:39:54,047
An associate position. I'm
thinking about taking it.

1195
01:39:54,071 --> 01:39:55,006
Really?

1196
01:39:55,030 --> 01:39:55,591
Ya.

1197
01:39:55,615 --> 01:39:57,634
Going back to the no, huh!

1198
01:39:57,658 --> 01:39:59,594
I guess so.

1199
01:39:59,618 --> 01:40:01,137
Well, good luck man.

1200
01:40:01,161 --> 01:40:02,955
Thanks man
