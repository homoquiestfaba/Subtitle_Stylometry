THERE'S A SLIGHT GLITCH

53
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,622

54
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:02,690
WE DON'T NEED MUSIC.

55
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:03,691
IT'S YOUR WEDDING.

56
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:04,592
SECOND WEDDING.

57
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,660

TRIED ON THE DRESS.

00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:36,590
BUT IT JUST FEELS...

74
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:37,891
-INTRUSIVE?
-A LITTLE.

75
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:38,959
A LOT.

76
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,594
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

77
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,196
THE THING IS,
A BUYER WANTS TO KNOW

78
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,431
WHAT A HOME
COULD LOOK LIKE,

79
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:45,433
NOT WHAT IT DOES LOOK LIKE.

80
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:47,568
MEMORIES ARE WONDERFUL, BUT...

81
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:49,503
THEY'RE YOURS.

82
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:51,472
ALL RIGHT, GO TO IT.

00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,541

OKAY.

85
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:56,844
DON'T WORRY,
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.

00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,412
THANK YOU.

87
00:02:58,446 --> 00:02:59,580

OKAY...

89
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:04,685
THAT GOES.

90
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:05,953
LAMP CAN STAY.

91
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,222
CURTAINS GO.

92
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,663

YEAH, SWEET,

99
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:26,006
BUT GUILT-INDUCING.

100
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,040
DO WE WANT TO
TAKE THE CHANCE

101
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:30,344
THAT AN ALL-CASH BUYER
MISSED HIS KID'S SCHOOL PLAY

102
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:31,645
OR FIRST PITCH?

103
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,454

ANYWAY, WE BROKE UP.

136
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:17,084
OH, HONEY, I'M SORRY.

137
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:22,122
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
WHEN I GO OFF TO COLLEGE?

138
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,625
PROBABLY RENT AN APARTMENT

139
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,695

144
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,968

162
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:18,446
CAN YOU STAGE THE HOPE STREET
COLONIAL TOMORROW?

163
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,781
NO, TOMORROW'S THURSDAY.

164
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,916
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
ABOUT GOING UP ALONE,

165
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,884
AND THEN I COULD
MEET YOU THERE

166
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,486
FRIDAY NIGHT?

167
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,055
YEAH, OR YOU COULD SHOW
THE HOLLAND ESTATE

168
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,122
FRIDAY NIGHT,

169
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:30,624
AND JUST COME UP
SATURDAY MORNING.

170
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:31,892
THAT'S AN EVEN
BETTER IDEA.

171
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:33,494
PERFECT.

172
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,796
OKAY, SO,
REHEARSAL DINNER IS AT 7:00.

173
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:36,864
UH-HUH...

00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,732
AND I'M THINKING
AROUND NOON?

175
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,568
THAT WAY, YOU CAN SHOW
THE COLONIAL ON YOUR WAY IN.

176
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:41,769
THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU.

177
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,604
THAT'S WHY YOU LOVE ME?

178
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:45,072

179
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:46,740

AND GET THIS OVER WITH?

183
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:53,213
BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER
THINKS WE ARE UNROMANTIC.

184
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,082
WE'RE NOT UNROMANTIC, ARE WE?

185
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,216
NO, LOOK AT US.

186
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,952
CHAMPAGNE, SUSHI.

187
00:06:58,986 --> 00:06:59,920
OPEN HOUSE.

188
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:03,123
THERE'S THE MAN
OF THE HOUR.

189
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,058
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

190
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,494
GREAT NEWS, BRUCE.
MULTIPLE OFFERS.

191
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:07,961
I DON'T CARE,
I'M NOT SELLING.

192
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:09,863
OLIVIA, THE PLACE
IS AMAZING.

193
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:11,599
I'VE FALLEN BACK
IN LOVE WITH IT AGAIN.

194
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:12,666
I'M STAYING,

195
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,001
AND I'M BUYING
THE FURNITURE, TOO.

196
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,207
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED

197
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,042
THE LAST TIME
YOU TRIED TO FIX THAT.

198
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,546
I'M TRYING NOT TO.

199
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,748
WELL, I'VE COME
A LONG WAY, HAVEN'T I?

200
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:28,782
FROM A SPOTLIGHT
ON THE STAGE

201
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:30,818
TO A FLASHLIGHT
UNDER THE SINK.

202
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,119
WEDDING CAKE.

203
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:35,989
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK.

204
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,259
THEY'RE PROBABLY ALL GOOD.

205
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,595
MM. GOOD, YEAH.

206
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:42,996
I DON'T KNOW, SHOULDN'T
THE BRIDE BE DECIDING THIS?

207
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:45,733
I LIKE THE LEMON.

208
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,601
I JUST HEARD FROM
THE BRIDE'S DAUGHTER.

209
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:48,836
DON'T TELL ME
THEY CANCELED.

210
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:49,837
NO, THEIR BAND DID.

211
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,038
OH. WELL, CALL LYNN.

212
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,740
-OUT OF TOWN.
-WHAT ABOUT THE JENSONS?

213
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:53,807
I ALREADY TRIED.

214
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:54,808
WELL, I'M SURE
SOMEONE'S AROUND.

215
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,476
SOMEONE IS.

216
00:07:58,579 --> 00:07:59,713
NO.

217
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:01,248
THERE'S NO TIME
TO GET ANYONE ELSE.

218
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,550
PLEASE?

219
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,751
IT'LL BE GOOD FOR YOU
TO PLAY AGAIN.

220
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:04,652
-I PLAY ALL THE TIME.
-TO THE DUCKS.

221
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,086
THEY GET MY MUSIC.

222
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:08,722
I ALREADY SAID YOU'D DO IT.

223
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:10,157
-JULIE!
-IT'S SETTLED THEN.

224
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,124
THANKS, DAD.

225
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,595
MICK!

226
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:16,564
ARE YOU IN HERE?

227
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:17,765
NOWHERE TO HIDE
NOW, PAL.

228
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:19,867
BE RIGHT OUT!

229
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,602
GO WITH THE LEMON.

230
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,640
HEY.

231
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:28,008
HI.

232
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,877
DID WE HAVE A GOLF
GAME I FORGOT ABOUT?

233
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,012
WELL, IF YOU COULD TAKE
THE AFTERNOON OFF, WE DO.

234
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,114
OH, I'D LOVE TO,
BUT I'M SWAMPED HERE.

235
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,616
JULIE CAN HANDLE THINGS
FOR A FEW HOURS.

236
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,850
RIGHT?

237
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:39,252
YEAH, IT'S FINE, DAD.

238
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:40,220
WELL, THE THING IS,

239
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,121
I JUST FOUND OUT

240
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:42,222
WE HAVE A WEDDING
COMING IN THIS WEEKEND--

241
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,857
FINE.

242
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:46,293
BUT TOMORROW NIGHT, DINNER.

243
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:49,229
AND I AM NOT TAKING NO
FOR AN ANSWER.

244
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,833
TOODLES.

245
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,869
TOODLES.

246
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:00,107
SOUNDS LIKE A DATE.

247
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,308
SHE'S VERY FRIENDLY.

248
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,610
SHE LIKES YOU.

249
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,144
YEAH, I'M IRRESISTIBLE.

250
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:05,813
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
RE-ENTER THE DATING POOL

251
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:06,880
SOMETIME.

252
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,970
BE READY SOON, GRACE!

253
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:32,940
HI!

254
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:34,141
MOM...

255
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:35,709
ARE YOU DRIVING UP WITH US?

256
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,777
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

257
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,745
JOHNNY HAS A GOLF TOURNAMENT.

258
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,046
WE'RE DRIVING UP TOMORROW.

259
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,681
WHO...

260
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:41,849
WHO'S JOHNNY?

261
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,617
OH, MY PLUS ONE.

262
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:45,953
YOU ARE GOING TO
LOVE HIM.

263
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:48,121
HE'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE
OF MY LAST PLUS ONE.

264
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:49,857
OH.

265
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,825
CAN'T WAIT TO MEET HIM.

266
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:53,093
AND I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW RELIEVED I AM

267
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,195
THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO
BE ALONE ANYMORE.

268
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,898
OH, MOM, I'M NOT ALONE.

269
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,667
I HAVE GRACE, AND I HAVE WORK.

270
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,735
THAT IS NOT THE SAME
AS HAVING A HUSBAND.

271
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:03,804
I SHOULD KNOW, I'VE HAD A FEW.

272
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,138
AND WHAT IS THIS I HEAR

273
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:08,275
ABOUT YOU ORDERING
YOUR WEDDING DRESS ONLINE?

274
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,077
YOU COULD HAVE BORROWED
ONE FROM ME.

275
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,278
I'M NOT SURE WEARING
A WEDDING DRESS

276
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,312
FROM A FAILED MARRIAGE

277
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,847
IS A GOOD IDEA.

278
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:15,215
JUST BECAUSE THEY ENDED
DOES NOT MEAN THEY FAILED.

279
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:18,218
OH, THERE SHE IS.

280
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:19,286
GRAM!

281
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:20,754
I DIDN'T EXPECT
TO SEE YOU

282
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:21,689
UNTIL TOMORROW.

283
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:24,758
JUST DROPPING OFF GIFTS
FOR MY TWO GIRLS.

284
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:25,759
OLIVIA...

285
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:26,760
THANK YOU, MOM.

286
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:28,095
NOW, GRACE,

287
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,229
I KNOW THAT YOU PREFER
THE NATURAL LOOK,

288
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:32,165
BUT YOUR MOTHER WILL ATTEST
TO THE POWER OF MAKEUP.

289
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,202
YOU SHOULD TRY
THE WRINKLE CREAM, HONEY.

290
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,269
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY

291
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,671
SOMEONE LIKE JOSH
COMES ALONG.

292
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:40,808
A DEMAIN.

293
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,883
DID SHE JUST CRITICIZE US,
OR COMPLIMENT US?

294
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:52,352
I THINK BOTH.

295
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,355
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

296
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,691
YOU AND JOSH
TOOK FOUR DAYS OFF?

297
00:10:57,725 --> 00:10:59,426
I'M PRETTY SURE... NEVER.

298
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,128
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

299
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,831
ACTUALLY, I THINK THIS
IS THE FIRST WEEKEND

300
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,899
WITHOUT AN OPEN HOUSE.

301
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:09,002
WELL, WE ARE LEAVING
THE CITY BEHIND NOW,

302
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:10,971
SO YOU TWO
CAN'T DO ANY BUSINESS.

303
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,373
I LIKE YOUR
THINKING, HONEY.

304
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,908
REMEMBER THAT

305
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:18,111
WHEN I TELL YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE ON THE GUEST LIST.

306
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:19,179
48.

307
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,814
48?

308
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:24,351
GRACE, THIS WAS SUPPOSED
TO JUST BE A FEW FRIENDS.

309
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:25,986
I KNOW,
I GOT CARRIED AWAY.

310
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,955
WHY AM I
NOT SURPRISED?

311
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,289
SOME OF THEM

312
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:30,858
ARE COMING UP
ON SATURDAY...

313
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:32,192
OKAY, WAIT, SATURDAY?

314
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:33,827
BUT MOST OF THEM
ARE DRIVING UP ON SUNDAY

315
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,362
FOR THE CEREMONY.

316
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:36,396
AND THE DINNER,

317
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,032
AND THE MUSIC,

318
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:41,168
AND THE LANTERN
LIGHTING OVER THE LAKE.

319
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,369
ARE YOU MAD?

320
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:43,971
NO. NO.

321
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,405
OF COURSE, I'M NOT MAD.

322
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,340
THAT SOUNDS BEAUTIFUL.

323
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:12,032
HI!

324
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,033
WELCOME TO WILLOW LAKE.

325
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,001
I'M JULIE TURNER.

326
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,502
GRACE PERSHING.

327
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:17,537
WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE,
LIKE, 15 TIMES.

328
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,006
16.

329
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,808
NICE SHOES.

330
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,343
THIS IS MY MOM,

331
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:25,312
A.K.A. THE WORST
BRIDE EVER.

332
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:27,147
OH...
HI. I'M OLIVIA.

333
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,281
NICE TO MEET YOU.

334
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,149
NICE TO MEET
YOU, TOO.

335
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:32,252
WOW, YOUR PLACE
IS REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

336
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:33,386
THANK YOU.

337
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,088
I MIGHT SUGGEST
YOU MOVE THIS PLANTER

338
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:36,523
OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE PORTICO--

339
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,558
-MOM...
-SORRY.

340
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,393
IT'S PERFECT THE WAY IT IS.

341
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,361
WEDDING JITTERS?

342
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:42,329
WORKAHOLIC.

343
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:43,430
HMM.

344
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,132
I PROMISE
THE NEXT FEW DAYS

345
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,000
WILL BE AMAZING.

346
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:48,068
SHALL I SHOW YOU AROUND,

347
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,469
OR SHOULD WE WAIT
FOR THE GROOM?

348
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,938
OH, NO, NO, IT'S JUST US.

349
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:51,905
HE'LL BE HERE ON SATURDAY.

350
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:53,040
HOPEFULLY.

351
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:55,542
HE'S THE WORST GROOM EVER.

352
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,444
THE PERFECT
COUPLE, THEN.

353
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:00,013
WHO'S THIS?

354
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:01,014
THAT'S LUCKY.

355
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:02,082
LUCKY?

356
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,417
HE DOESN'T USUALLY TAKE
TO STRANGERS LIKE THAT.

357
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,020
GOLDEN RETRIEVERS AND I
GO WAY BACK.

358
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:08,021
WE'VE HAD THREE.

359
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:09,089
US TOO.

360
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:11,258
SORRY, GIRLS,
I'LL GRAB THIS REAL QUICK.

361
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,026
BRUCE, HI.

362
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,962
COME ON,
I'LL SIGN YOU IN.

363
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,334
I LOVE THOSE.

364
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:23,036
WELL, THAT'S GOOD

365
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,604
BECAUSE I'M
YOUR WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER.

366
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,039
YOU TOOK THOSE?

367
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:27,074
THEY'RE AMAZING.

368
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,275
THANKS.

369
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,982
THIS PLACE IS BEAUTIFUL.

370
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,549
IT'S EVEN BETTER
THAN I'D HOPED.

371
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,618
WE CAN HAVE THE CEREMONY
EITHER INSIDE OR OUT.

372
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,453
OUTSIDE.
DEFINITELY.

373
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,189
SHOULD WE WAIT FOR
YOUR MOM TO WEIGH IN?

374
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:43,256
SHE WON'T CARE.

375
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,357
YOU'RE SURE?

376
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:45,258
POSITIVE.

377
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,294
SHE'D GET MARRIED
IN THE CAR IF SHE COULD.

378
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:49,930
THAT COULD WORK.
WE DO HAVE A TRUCK.

379
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:51,298
ONCE WE GET
YOU SIGNED IN,

380
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,866
I'LL SHOW YOU THE GROUNDS,

381
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,335
AND THE PERFECT OUTDOOR SPOT,

382
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,337
UNLESS YOU WANT TO SEE
THE TRUCK.

383
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,372
WE'LL KEEP THAT
AS A BACKUP PLAN.

384
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:00,874
I'LL MAKE SURE IT'S WASHED.

385
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:02,409
YOU REMIND ME OF SOMEONE.

386
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,244
WHO'S THAT?

387
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:05,946
ME.

388
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,547
LET'S JUST GO
WITH THE SECTIONAL.

389
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,117
WE CAN CHANGE OUT THE PILLOWS.

390
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,951
A POP OF PINK WOULD BE GREAT--
YES, THANK YOU.

391
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:11,985
OOH! OH!

392
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,020
YOU OKAY?

393
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,121
I'M SO SORRY.

394
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:15,388
NO, NO, MY FAULT--

395
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,458
MICK?

396
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:19,459
LIVVY?

397
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,229
YOU LOOK...

398
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,131
OLDER?

399
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:25,465
BEAUTIFUL.

400
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:30,503
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

401
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,239
I'M GETTING MARRIED.

402
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:34,374
YOU'RE THE
PERSHING-JOHNSON WEDDING?

403
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,176
YEAH.

404
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,677
HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

405
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,912
YOU CHANGED YOUR NAME?

406
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:40,914
PERSHING WAS MY FIRST HUSBAND.

407
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:42,249
HOW MANY HUSBANDS
HAVE YOU HAD?

408
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,484
WHY ARE YOU STANDING HERE
WITH ALL THE TOWELS?

409
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,088
I LIVE HERE.

410
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,556
WHAT?

411
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,158
I OWN THE PLACE.

412
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,229
YEAH, IT GETS WORSE.

413
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:58,065
I'M YOUR WEDDING SINGER.

414
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,008
UH, MOM?

415
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,242
OKAY, I'M DYING.

416
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:10,377
DAD?

417
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,344
I CAN'T FEEL MY LEGS.

418
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:12,379
WHAT'S WRONG?

419
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,114
-NOTHING.
-EVERYTHING.

420
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:16,083
IT WAS A MILLION YEARS AGO,
BEFORE YOUR FATHER.

421
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:17,350
BEFORE YOUR MOM.
WE WERE--

422
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,119
---REALLY YOUNG.
---AND STUPID.

423
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:21,421
--HE GOT A RECORD DEAL,
AND HE WENT OFF TOURING,

424
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,390
--I CAME BACK, AND SHE WAS
ALREADY WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

425
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,624
HE WAS MY FIRST LOVE.

426
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,126
SHE BROKE MY HEART.

427
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,095
HOW DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS?

428
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,729
I GUESS I JUST NEVER
WANTED TO THINK ABOUT HIM.

429
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,231
--EVER AGAIN.
EVER.

430
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,632
I'LL CANCEL.

431
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,434
WE CAN DO
THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE THING

432
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:35,735
LIKE YOU WANTED.

433
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,637
YOU WANTED TO GIVE ME
A MEMORABLE WEEKEND,

434
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,239
AND IT WILL BE THAT.

435
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,241
BESIDES, HONEY, WE HAVE
48 PEOPLE COMING THIS SUNDAY.

436
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,443
57.

437
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:44,511
I LIED.

438
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,181
MAYBE SHE'LL CANCEL.

439
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:49,516
YOU'D BETTER HOPE NOT.

440
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,318
WE SPENT THEIR DEPOSIT
ON DORM FEES.

441
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,153
ALL OF IT?

442
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:08,468
HI. THIS IS JOSH JOHNSON.

443
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:11,104
PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE
AT THE TONE.

444
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,440
JOSH, HEY, IT'S ME.

445
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,775
OKAY, SO, THIS IS KIND OF WEIRD.

446
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,778
WELL, ACTUALLY, IT'S KIND OF
FUNNY...

447
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,380
OR NOT.

448
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:23,150
UM, JUST GIVE ME A CALL.

449
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,651
I LOVE YOU.

450
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:30,523
FOR YOU.

451
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,592
OH.

452
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,693
THANK YOU.

453
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,295
WELL, THEY'RE NOT FROM ME.

454
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,363
THEY'RE FROM A....

455
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:39,399
"JOSH JOHNSON.

456
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,401
NUMBER TWO REAL ESTATE AGENT
IN LONG ISLAND"

457
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:42,802
GOOD-LOOKING GUY.

458
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,237
A LITTLE
OFF YOUR TYPE.

459
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,239
MY TYPE HAS CHANGED.

460
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,611
LOOK, CLEARLY, THIS IS AWKWARD,

461
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:53,246
SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO CANCEL,
I UNDERSTAND.

462
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,381
I DO.

463
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:57,417
BUT I CAN'T, I DON'T WANT TO
DISAPPOINT MY DAUGHTER.

464
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,819
BESIDES, I BARELY REMEMBER
THE DAY YOU LEFT ME

465
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,621
STANDING ON THE SIDEWALK.

466
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,456
SO THAT'S HOW
IT'S GONNA BE, HUH?

467
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,457
THAT'S HOW IT WAS.

468
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:05,425
WELL, I BEG TO DIFFER.

469
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,195
YOU STILL ALLERGIC TO ROSES?

470
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:09,496
NO, I'M NOT.

471
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:12,499
MAYBE YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO ME.

472
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,666
MOM!

473
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,635
WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE
THE HONEYMOON CABIN!

474
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:17,537
AW, LET ME PUT THESE
IN YOUR ROOM.

475
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,672
THANK YOU.

476
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,341
PUT THEM BY THE WINDOW,
SHE'S ALLERGIC.

477
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,185
DON'T YOU JUST LOVE IT?

478
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:33,320
THE RIVER ROCK FIREPLACE?

479
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,188
THE VIEW TO THE LAKE?

480
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,156
HONEY, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

481
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,759
MY DAD PUT A LOT OF
TIME INTO THIS ONE.

482
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,561
YOUR DAD DID THIS?

483
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:45,132
YEAH, HE REBUILT
THE ENTIRE PLACE.

484
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:48,268
IT TOOK HIS MIND OFF THINGS
WHEN MY MOM DIED.

485
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:50,837
OH.

486
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,405
I DIDN'T KNOW.

487
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:53,573
I'M SORRY.

488
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,342
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO BRING THAT UP.

489
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,410
NO, NO, NO, I'M GLAD YOU DID.

490
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,846
I'VE KNOWN YOUR DAD
FOR A LONG TIME.

491
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:02,815
I FEEL AWFUL.

492
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:05,418
IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS NOW.

493
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:07,120
HE'S KIND OF SHUT DOWN
SINCE THEN.

494
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:09,789
WHICH IS WHY
I WAS SO GLAD

495
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,459
HE AGREED TO SING
AT YOUR WEDDING.

496
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:13,793
HE REALLY DOESN'T
PLAY MUCH ANYMORE.

497
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,628
UNLESS YOU WANT ME
TO GET SOMEONE ELSE--

498
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:17,664
-NO.
-YOU'RE SURE?

499
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:18,765
ABSOLUTELY.

500
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20,767
I MEAN, WHERE ELSE
ARE WE GOING TO FIND A POP STAR

501
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,768
IN VERMONT

502
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:24,471
THAT'S AVAILABLE ON SUNDAY
FROM 2:00 TO 4:00?

503
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:25,872
WHATEVER YOU DO,

504
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,540
DON'T LET HIM HEAR YOU SAY
"POP STAR".

505
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:28,641
HE HATES THAT.

506
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,677
OKAY, YEAH, I REMEMBER.

507
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,179
I'LL LET YOU GET SETTLED IN.

508
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:33,180
GRACE, I'LL SHOW YOU YOURS.

509
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:34,147
IT'S JUST ALONG THE PATH.

510
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:36,383
LEAD THE WAY.

511
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,185
THANK YOU.

512
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,443
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

513
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,611
I HAVE TO THROW
A WEDDING FOR HER?

514
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:05,678
AND SING!

515
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:06,679
WHILE SHE MARRIES

516
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,848
THE NUMBER TWO REAL ESTATE
AGENT IN LONG ISLAND?

517
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,783
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

518
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,452
UNLESS YOU STILL HAVE
FEELINGS FOR HER.

519
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,254
FEELINGS?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HER.

520
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,155
SHE'S A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PERSON.

521
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:18,358
HOW DOES SHE LOOK?

522
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:22,161
THAT GOOD, HUH?

523
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,421
POP STAR...

524
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:50,923
STAGER...

525
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,495
LUCKY, NO!

526
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,297
SORRY.

527
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,399
THAT'S OKAY.

528
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:03,303
HE LOOKS
SO MUCH LIKE ROWDY.

529
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:04,637
RIGHT?
YOU KNOW, I RESCUED HIM,

530
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:06,773
AND I THINK IT TURNS OUT
HE ACTUALLY RESCUED ME.

531
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:12,579
YOU REMEMBER
HOW WE FOUND ROWDY?

532
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:13,813
YEAH.

533
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:16,516
WASN'T HE EATING PIZZA
BEHIND THE DORM?

534
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,750
THE DOG LOVED HIS PIZZA.

535
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:19,986
HE DID.

536
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,923
UM...

537
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,626
JULIE TOLD ME ABOUT HER MOM.

538
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:27,827
I'M SO SORRY.

539
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,697
OH, THAT'S NICE OF YOU,
THANK YOU.

540
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,031
YEAH, UM...

541
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,567
IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO ADJUST.

542
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:35,635
I THINK I'M STILL ADJUSTING.

543
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:36,869
YEAH.

544
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:37,904
WHAT ABOUT YOU

545
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:38,938
AND YOUR HUSBAND?

546
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:39,806
HUSBAND NUMBER ONE?

547
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,709
OH, THAT DIDN'T TAKE
MUCH ADJUSTING.

548
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,344
HE LEFT AFTER GRACE WAS BORN.

549
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:45,645
I'M SORRY.

550
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,547
IT ALL WORKED OUT.

551
00:20:51,518 --> 00:20:54,354
WELL, YOU SURE PICKED
A BEAUTIFUL PLACE

552
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:55,588
TO SETTLE DOWN.

553
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:56,956
OH. YEAH.

554
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,659
IT WAS MY WIFE'S HOMETOWN.

555
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,394
FIGURED IT'D BE A GOOD PLACE
TO RAISE A KID.

556
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:02,662
JULIE'S A GREAT GIRL.

557
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:03,630
SO IS GRACE.

558
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:04,831
YEAH.

559
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:06,499
I GUESS WE DID PRETTY GOOD THEN.

560
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:08,668
YEAH.

561
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:13,373
WELL, I'D BETTER
GET BACK TO MY... STUFF.

562
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:14,607
OH, SURE.

563
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:15,642
SEE YA.

564
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:16,643
YEAH.

565
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:17,710
OH, UM...

566
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:18,711
HOW'S YOUR MOTHER?

567
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:19,879
STILL HATES YOU.

568
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:30,357
SO, THE GROOM.

569
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,791
WILL HE WANT
TO GO OVER THE MENU?

570
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,993
NO, HE AND MY MOM
HAVE THE SAME TASTE.

571
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,395
THEY'RE EXACTLY ALIKE.

572
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:36,796
THAT MAKES IT EASY.

573
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,598
I GUESS IT DOES.

574
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:40,667
HEY, GIRLS.

575
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,034
-HELLO.
-HI.

576
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,606
IT'S NICE THAT YOU GUYS
ARE SO CLOSE.

577
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,608
ACTUALLY WE'RE
WORKING TOGETHER,

578
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,742
TEMPORARILY.

579
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:50,810
SHE'S "GROOMING" ME.

580
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:53,580
MOTHER AND DAUGHTER
STAGERS.

581
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:55,047
YIKES.

582
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:57,049
SHE WANTS ME TO BE
JUST LIKE HER.

583
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,385
YIKES AGAIN.

584
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:00,052
NO KIDDING.

585
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:01,621
DO YOU HAVE ANY
BROTHERS OR SISTERS?

586
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:02,589
ONLY CHILD.

587
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:03,823
ME TOO.

588
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:06,859
YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB,
ORGANIZING THIS WEDDING.

589
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:09,496
I SURE HOPE SO.

590
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:11,564
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ANYTHING HERE.

591
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:12,865
WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS
THE PERFECT WEDDING,

592
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:14,901
ESPECIALLY SINCE
IT MIGHT BE...

593
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:16,035
MIGHT BE WHAT?

594
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:19,706
NOTHING.

595
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:22,842
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I'M TALKING SO MUCH.

596
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,777
BECAUSE OUR PARENTS
ARE EXES?

597
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:26,679
AND WE HAVE
THE SAME SHOES.

598
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:30,149
HE'S SELLING
THE PLACE.

599
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,818
HE DOESN'T THINK
I KNOW,

600
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,887
BUT HE LEFT THE INFO
ON THE OFFICE COMPUTER.

601
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:38,124
HE'S NOT EXACTLY
A TECHIE.

602
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,865
HE SAID YOU LOOKED
GREAT, BUT WOW.

603
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:47,767
-DUKE!
-HI!

604
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,170
AW, IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

605
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,506
WHO IS OUR BOY GONNA GET
TO DO THE COOKING, HUH?

606
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,741
YOU STILL, UH,
COOKING FRIED CHEESE STICKS

607
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:55,808
WITH PEANUT BUTTER?

608
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:56,943
YOU KIDDING?

609
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:58,778
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GETTING
FOR YOUR REHEARSAL DINNER.

610
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:00,980
AND I'M GONNA
BACK HIM UP ON DRUMS

611
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:02,048
ON YOUR WEDDING SONG, TOO.

612
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:03,683
♪ BA-DUM-BUM... ♪

613
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:04,751
OH, YOU HAVEN'T MISSED A BEAT.

614
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:06,453
OR LOST A POUND.

615
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:08,054
-YOU LOOK GREAT.
-THANK YOU.

616
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:10,923
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT CLUB
THAT WE PLAYED,

617
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:11,791
THE ONE NEAR THE RIVER?

618
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:13,993
IT WAS MORE OF
AN INDUSTRIAL RUN-OFF.

619
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:14,927
WELL, YEAH,

620
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:16,796
AND WE HAD
THE THREE AUDIENCE MEMBERS...

621
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,665
YEAH, IT WAS THE BARTENDER,
THE WAITER AND THE DISHWASHER.

622
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:19,832
THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH.

623
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:21,734
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT
THE SONG YOU WROTE FOR THAT ONE

624
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:23,470
WAS, UH... IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

625
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:24,471
YEAH.

626
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:25,638
OH.

627
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:26,873
ARE YOU STILL WRITING?

628
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:30,643
UH, YEAH,
I MEAN, WELL, POST-ITS.

629
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:32,011
AND WEDDING VOWS.

630
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:33,513
CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT,
BY THE WAY.

631
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:35,582
AW, THANK YOU.

632
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:37,917
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
LIVED HERE?

633
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,052
ALL MY LIFE.

634
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:43,456
IT'S PROBABLY
FOR THE BEST.

635
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,724
HE NEEDS A FRESH START,

636
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,527
AND THERE'S TOO MANY
MEMORIES HERE.

637
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,529
IT SOUNDS LIKE
GOOD MEMORIES.

638
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:51,230
YEAH.

639
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:55,702
HE GAVE UP A LOT
TO RAISE ME.

640
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:56,703
HE SOUNDS LIKE
A GREAT DAD.

641
00:23:56,736 --> 00:23:58,204
HE REALLY IS.

642
00:23:58,237 --> 00:23:59,238
YOU'RE LUCKY.

643
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,941
NOT EVERYONE HAS
ONE OF THOSE.

644
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:02,909
HE WON'T SAY IT,

645
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:05,745
BUT HE'S DREADING THE DAY
I LEAVE FOR COLLEGE.

646
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,146
MY MOM WENT THROUGH
THAT PHASE.

647
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,615
AND SHE SURVIVED?

648
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:09,916
THEY ALL DO.

649
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,551
AND HE'LL MAKE
YOUR ROOM REALLY NICE

650
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:12,785
WHEN YOU COME HOME
FOR HOLIDAYS,

651
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,253
SO YOU WON'T
WANT TO LEAVE.

652
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,689
THAT DOESN'T
SOUND SO BAD.

653
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:18,257
HE'LL PROBABLY BUY
HIMSELF A FEW THINGS,

654
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,527
CLOTHES,
MAYBE A NEW CAR.

655
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,594
OKAY...

656
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,563
AND THEN THERE'S
THE HOBBIES.

657
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:24,964
YOU KNOW, THE THINGS
THEY THOUGHT

658
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:27,600
THEY ALWAYS WANTED TO DO
BUT REALLY DIDN'T?

659
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:28,768
LIKE WHAT?

660
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,538
IN MY MOM'S CASE,
IT WAS WEAVING.

661
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:33,840
FOLLOWED BY
SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING.

662
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:34,907
SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING?

663
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:37,910
IT'S AN OLYMPIC EVENT.

664
00:24:37,944 --> 00:24:39,679
OH, AND
THE MANDARIN LESSONS.

665
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:41,213
YOUR MOM
CAN SPEAK MANDARIN?

666
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:43,015
"NI HAO.

667
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:45,051
NI CHIFAN LE MA."

668
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,819
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

669
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:48,688
"HELLO, HAVE YOU EATEN?"

670
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:49,756
WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH
WHAT SHE ASKS ME

671
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:52,124
IN ENGLISH
FIVE TIMES A DAY.

672
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:55,094
THANK YOU.

673
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:56,663
'KAY. TALK
TO YOU SOON.

674
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,267
JOSH, HI!

675
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,234
SO, GUESS WHAT I JUST HEARD?

676
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:03,369
DID GRACE CALL YOU?

677
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:06,072
HONEY, I... I WANTED
TO TELL YOU MYSELF.

678
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:07,907
IT'S REALLY NO BIG DEAL--

679
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,208
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

680
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,143
IT'S A HUGE DEAL.

681
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,112
PROPERTIES LIKE THAT
NEVER COME ON THE MARKET.

682
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:15,615
WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

683
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:16,916
THE LISTING WENT UP YESTERDAY.

684
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:17,917
"FOR SALE BY OWNER.

685
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:18,985
NO BROKER."

686
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,720
APPARENTLY, THE OWNER
IS SOME SINGER

687
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:22,321
WHO WAS FAMOUS IN THE '70s?

688
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,323
IT WAS THE '80s.

689
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,925
IS THERE ANY WAY THAT YOU COULD
PUT IN A GOOD WORD FOR ME

690
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:26,926
BEFORE I GET UP THERE?

691
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:29,261
ACTUALLY, NO, I CAN'T.

692
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:30,863
IT WOULD BE A LITTLE WEIRD,

693
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:32,699
BECAUSE AS IT TURNS OUT,

694
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:34,300
HE'S MY COLLEGE BOYFRIEND.

695
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,238
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

696
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,807
I KNOW, IT'S TOTALLY AWKWARD.

697
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,841
AWKWARD?

698
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,209
IT'S GREAT.

699
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:45,678
UNLESS HE HATES YOU
FOR BREAKING UP WITH HIM.

700
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:47,013
NO.

701
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:47,980
IF I GET THIS LISTING,

702
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:49,982
IT COULD OPEN UP
THE HIGH-END VERMONT MARKET.

703
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:51,984
THIS COULD BE BIG FOR US.

704
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:54,721
I... I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT.

705
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:55,988
WELL, THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU.

706
00:25:57,189 --> 00:26:00,126
HONEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
COMING UP BEFORE SATURDAY?

707
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,094
WHY, WHAT'S WRONG?

708
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:03,963
I DON'T KNOW,

709
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:05,164
I JUST MISS YOU.

710
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:06,365
AW...

711
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,667
I MISS YOU, TOO--

712
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,601
OH, HANG ON,

713
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:09,602
I GOT ANOTHER CALL.

714
00:26:09,636 --> 00:26:10,837
I GOTTA TAKE THIS ONE.

715
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:20,747
JULIE SAID THIS IS
BEST FOOD IN TOWN.

716
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,149
GREAT.
I AM STARVING.

717
00:26:35,662 --> 00:26:36,763
HI THERE, HANDSOME.

718
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:40,599
YOU CLEANED UP
REAL GOOD.

719
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,406
DID YOU TRY ON THE DRESS YET?

720
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,407
MM.

721
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,909
I WILL.

722
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:50,977
I PROMISE.

723
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,078
WEDDING VOWS?

724
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,079
ALMOST.

725
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,113
MOM...

726
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:55,114
I STARTED.

727
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:56,315
OKAY.

728
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:57,283
LET'S HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE.

729
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:58,317
OKAY.

730
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:02,254
TELL ME YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
READ FROM YOUR PHONE

731
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,622
AT THE CEREMONY.

732
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,694
"JOSH...

733
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:10,096
"WHEN I STAGED YOUR OPEN HOUSE
THREE YEARS AGO,

734
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,331
"I HAD NO IDEA
WE'D END UP HERE.

735
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,701
"REAL ESTATE
IS A SMART INVESTMENT,

736
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:18,070
AND SO IS OUR RELATIONSHIP."

737
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:20,973
WHAT? IS THAT BAD?

738
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:22,308
AWFUL.

739
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:24,844
ALL RIGHT, HOW'S THIS?

740
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:25,978
"JOSH,

741
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:30,016
YOU MOVE HOUSES,
AND YOU MOVE ME."

742
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:30,983
WHAT WAS THAT?

743
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,353
HER WEDDING VOWS.

744
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,088
I'M STILL WORKING ON THEM.

745
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:37,156
DO YOU HAVE A TABLE

746
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:38,324
IN ANOTHER PART OF
THE RESTAURANT?

747
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:40,827
SORRY, MICK.
IT'S AN HOUR WAIT.

748
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:42,962
HOW ABOUT ONE
NEAR THE KITCHEN?

749
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,296
OR MAYBE IN THE KITCHEN?

750
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,766
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

751
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,467
UH, NO.

752
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,136
SO...

753
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,303
YOU TWO
KNOW EACH OTHER?

754
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:53,105
YES, WELL, WE USED TO.

755
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:54,974
CAMILLE,
THIS IS LIVVY PHILLIPS.

756
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:55,942
OR, UH, I'M SORRY,

757
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:58,277
PERSHING...

758
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,211
SLASH-HYPHEN-
JOHNSON-TO BE?

759
00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:00,880
HI.

760
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:01,981
HI.

761
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,082
-I'M OLIVIA.
-NICE TO MEET YOU.

762
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:04,083
YEAH, NICE TO
MEET YOU, TOO.

763
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:05,117
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER, GRACE.

764
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:07,119
-HI.
-HI.

765
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:08,254
OLIVIA'S GETTING MARRIED
ON SUNDAY.

766
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:10,189
OH, CONGRATULATIONS.

767
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:11,824
THANK YOU.

768
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:13,092
SHE'S MARRYING THE NUMBER TWO
REAL ESTATE AGENT

769
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,460
IN LONG ISLAND.

770
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:15,895
OH.

771
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:18,865
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN.

772
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:19,932
THANK YOU.

773
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,972
SO, WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT?

774
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:27,974
OH, UM, I THINK
YOU WERE TELLING ME

775
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:30,910
HOW THIS IS YOUR FIRST
ACTUAL DATE IN AGES.

776
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:35,047
I THOUGHT WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT HOW WE MET.

777
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:37,083
AT THE P.T.A. MEETING?

778
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:38,350
RIGHT.

779
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:41,387
MOM...

780
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,422
OH, I'M SORRY, HONEY.

781
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,157
WHAT WERE WE TALKING ABOUT?

782
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:46,392
WEDDING VOWS.

783
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:47,960
RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

784
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,400
I KNOW IT'S
NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

785
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:55,902
BUT HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
THE SONG WE WROTE

786
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:56,936
IN CENTRAL PARK?

787
00:28:56,969 --> 00:29:00,272
I REALLY DON'T RECALL.

788
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:02,041
-YOU WROTE A SONG?
-SEVERAL.

789
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,210
JUST SOME WORDS,
THAT'S IT.

790
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:06,078
I THINK WE USED TO
CALL THEM LYRICS.

791
00:29:06,112 --> 00:29:08,380
HOW AM I JUST HEARING
ABOUT THIS NOW?

792
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:09,949
BECAUSE IT WAS
A MILLION YEARS AGO,

793
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:11,517
AND I BARELY REMEMBER.

794
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:14,520
WHAT WAS THE SONG?

795
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:16,088
WHAT WAS IT...

796
00:29:16,122 --> 00:29:17,824
"WHERE DREAMS COME HOME."

797
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:19,091
REALLY?

798
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:21,260
NOW, WHERE HAVE I
HEARD THAT BEFORE?

799
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:23,129
OH, MY.

800
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:25,097
DO WE HAVE A COPYRIGHT
INFRINGEMENT HERE?

801
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:31,037
OKAY...

802
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:33,239
FINE.

803
00:29:37,076 --> 00:29:38,510
I'LL CHANGE IT.

804
00:29:38,544 --> 00:29:39,545
OH, NO.

805
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:40,947
NO, DON'T.

806
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,949
IT'S CATCHY.

807
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:52,959
I'M STARVING...

808
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,247
OH...

809
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,626
OH!

810
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,928
OH...

811
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:29,929
IT'S BAD LUCK
TO SEE THE DRESS

812
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:30,897
BEFORE THE WEDDING,
RIGHT?

813
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,999
YOU'RE NOT THE GROOM.

814
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:34,000
IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR GRACE,

815
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,067
SHE'S WITH JULIE.

816
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:36,903
THEY WENT
TO GET FLOWERS.

817
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:38,037
OH.

818
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,305
YOU FINISH
THOSE VOWS YET?

819
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,007
BECAUSE I HAVE A WHOLE DRAWER
OF UNUSED LYRICS.

820
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,875
OLD UNUSED LYRICS.

821
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:44,143
OH, IT'S SO HARD TO TURN DOWN,

822
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,111
BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SAY NO.

823
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:46,112
YOUR LOSS.

824
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:50,082
HEY, HOW WAS YOUR DATE?

825
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:51,217
YOU SHOULD KNOW,

826
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,284
YOU WERE PRACTICALLY
ON IT WITH ME.

827
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:55,354
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
I'D SAY YOU'RE A BIT RUSTY.

828
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:56,322
I'M NOT RUSTY!

829
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:03,896
I GUESS SEEING THE DRESS
BEFORE THE WEDDING

830
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,064
IS BAD LUCK.

831
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:07,033
I'M SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY.

832
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:09,635
IT'S MY FAULT,

833
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:10,970
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
LEFT THE ROOM.

834
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:12,304
TAKE IT OFF,
I'LL GET IT CLEANED.

835
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:14,373
I WOULD
IF I COULD GET OUT OF IT.

836
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:17,276
I'M PRETTY SURE
CLEANING IS NOT AN OPTION.

837
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:20,212
IT'S JUST RIGHT HERE.

838
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,683
DO YOU GET ALONG
WITH JOSH?

839
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,318
YEAH.

840
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:27,886
JOSH IS COOL.

841
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:30,222
REALLY.

842
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:32,091
YOU TRYING TO
CONVINCE ME OR YOU?

843
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:33,926
NO, HE'S A GREAT GUY,

844
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,262
AND MY MOM SEEMS HAPPY.

845
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:37,596
MOSTLY.

846
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,465
I DON'T KNOW.

847
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:42,568
I'M JUST NOT SURE I'VE EVER
SEEN THEM ACTUALLY KISS.

848
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:45,004
I MEAN, ON THE LIPS.

849
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:46,638
THAT PASSION,

850
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:49,375
LIKE IN THE MOVIES.

851
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:50,709
BUT MAYBE THAT'S JUST
WHAT HAPPENS

852
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,712
WHEN PEOPLE GET OLDER.

853
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,381
WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAD?

854
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,682
HAS HE BEEN SEEING ANYONE ELSE?

855
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:58,317
NO.

856
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,419
I TRY, BUT...

857
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:03,589
HE DOESN'T PLAY WELL
WITH OTHERS.

858
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:06,425
MY DAD'S A GREAT GUY,
HE JUST NEEDS A LITTLE--

859
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,659
A LITTLE EXCITEMENT?

860
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:09,261
EXACTLY.

861
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:10,997
MY MOM'S THE OPPOSITE.

862
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,598
SHE COULD USE A LITTLE...

863
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:14,233
SMALL-TOWN-I-NESS?

864
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:19,238
THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE TO LIFE
THAN JUST WORK, RIGHT?

865
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,472
THERE BETTER BE.

866
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:27,479
OH!

867
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:28,747
OH, I'M SORRY.

868
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,116
I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO GET THAT FIXED.

869
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:31,150
LOOK-- I'M SORRY.

870
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:32,384
IT'S FINE.

871
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:33,419
IF I STAY HERE
LONG ENOUGH,

872
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,287
I MIGHT NEED
A WHOLE NEW WARDROBE.

873
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:37,223
WELL, THAT WOULDN'T
NECESSARILY BE A BAD THING.

874
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:39,425
I'M JUST SAYING,

875
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,693
I GUESS I'M USED TO SEEING YOU
IN JEANS AND STUFF.

876
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:44,330
YOU'RE NOT USED
TO SEEING ME AT ALL.

877
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:48,100
THAT'S TRUE.

878
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:49,535
HI, JANEY!

879
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:50,536
MICK, HOW ARE YOU?

880
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:51,603
GOOD, GOOD.

881
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:52,704
WE NEED A DRESS.

882
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:54,540
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED?

883
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:56,575
YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE
NEVER GETTING MARRIED AGAIN.

884
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:57,609
OH....

885
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:58,644
I'M GETTING MARRIED.

886
00:32:58,677 --> 00:32:59,745
HE'S STILL
ON THE MARKET.

887
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:01,513
GREAT.

888
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:02,714
RIGHT THIS WAY.

889
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:28,274
LOOKS A LITTLE MERMAID-Y.

890
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:35,247
NO.

891
00:33:35,281 --> 00:33:36,382
NO.

892
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:37,549
NO.

893
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:58,270
THAT'S THE ONE.

894
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:01,573
REALLY?

895
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:04,643
DEFINITELY.

896
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:07,313
OKAY.

897
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:16,288
WE'LL TAKE THIS ONE.

898
00:34:16,322 --> 00:34:17,823
THERE'S NO "WE".

899
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:19,158
THANK YOU,

900
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:20,726
BUT YOU ARE NOT
BUYING MY WEDDING DRESS.

901
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:21,727
I RUINED THE FIRST ONE.

902
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,761
RING THIS UP.

903
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:23,729
NO, ACTUALLY, HERE.

904
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:25,131
PLEASE TAKE MINE.

905
00:34:25,164 --> 00:34:26,332
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER,

906
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:27,766
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE
THINKING ABOUT YOU

907
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:28,900
EVERY TIME I WEAR THIS DRESS.

908
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:31,170
WELL, HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU
PLANNING ON WEARING IT?

909
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:32,704
ONCE.

910
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:36,375
WELL, AT LEAST LET ME BUY YOU
A CUP OF COFFEE.

911
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:52,791
SO, YOU'RE A CHEF

912
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,326
AND A DRUMMER?

913
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,761
WELL, I USED TO BE.

914
00:34:55,794 --> 00:34:57,629
YOU QUIT
THE MUSIC BIZ LIKE MICK?

915
00:34:57,663 --> 00:34:59,765
NO, NO, I USED TO BE A CHEF.

916
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:00,899
I'M STILL A DRUMMER.

917
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,135
RECENT CUTBACKS
AROUND HERE

918
00:35:03,169 --> 00:35:05,171
DON'T REALLY ALLOW ME
TO DO MY BEST WORK, THOUGH.

919
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:06,738
I DIDN'T SEE THAT
IN THE BROCHURE.

920
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:07,873
OH, DON'T WORRY,

921
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:09,241
MICK'S ORDERED
ALL THE TOP-SHELF STUFF

922
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:11,343
FOR THE WEDDING.

923
00:35:11,377 --> 00:35:13,379
YOU PLAY WITH HIM
BACK IN THE DAY?

924
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:14,513
YEAH.

925
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:16,915
YEAH, I WAS THE HEARTBEAT
OF THAT BAND.

926
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,650
WHY DID HE LEAVE?

927
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:21,820
I THINK HE THOUGHT
HE WAS CHASING A DREAM,

928
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:25,157
AND HE JUST DIDN'T REALIZE
HE'D LEFT THE REAL THING BEHIND.

929
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:27,259
WHY DIDN'T MY MOM GO WITH HIM?

930
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:28,327
THEY WERE A TEAM.

931
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,696
YOU'D HAVE TO ASK
YOUR MOM THAT.

932
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:33,232
THEY WERE REALLY
THAT GOOD TOGETHER?

933
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:36,435
THEY WERE A PERFECT HARMONY,
THEY WERE LIKE ONE VOICE.

934
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:37,569
IT WAS PURE MAGIC.

935
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:40,839
I WISH I COULD'VE HEARD THEM.

936
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:42,408
WHAT DID THEY WRITE ABOUT?

937
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:46,212
I'VE GOT SOMETHING I THINK
YOU MIGHT WANNA HAVE A LOOK AT.

938
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,655
THIS IS EVERY LYRIC

939
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,924
THAT YOUR MOM
AND MICK WROTE.

940
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:03,729
"I FOUND WARMTH
IN YOUR EMBRACE,

941
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,197
"COMFORT
IN YOUR HEART,

942
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:07,233
AND HOME
IN YOUR EYES."

943
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:09,301
WOW.

944
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:11,570
YEAH... YOU KNOW WHAT?

945
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:13,439
THAT'S MICK'S HANDWRITING.

946
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:15,774
THIS ONE.

947
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:19,411
YEAH, THAT'S YOUR MOM.

948
00:36:19,445 --> 00:36:21,280
"LOVING YOU
IS LIKE BREATHING

949
00:36:21,313 --> 00:36:22,281
"I CAN'T STOP

950
00:36:22,314 --> 00:36:23,649
"BUT WHEN I DO

951
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:24,916
"I WANT TO HAVE
MY LAST BREATH SPENT

952
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,986
SHARING A KISS WITH YOU"

953
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,588
IT'S A LITTLE UNSETTLING,

954
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:30,722
'CAUSE IT'S MY MOM,

955
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:33,225
BUT WOW.

956
00:36:33,259 --> 00:36:34,326
THEY WERE INTENSE.

957
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,927
INTENSE IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

958
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:38,397
I JUST CAN'T WRAP
MY HEAD AROUND THIS.

959
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,267
MAYBE PEOPLE GET OLDER, AND...

960
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,502
AND CHANGE.

961
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,937
OR SOMETIMES,

962
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:48,807
THEY JUST NEED TO BE REMINDED
OF THEIR BEST WORK.

963
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:52,478
YOU MIND IF I TAKE THESE?

964
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:53,745
THEY'RE ALL YOURS.

965
00:36:57,783 --> 00:36:59,351
THANKS.

966
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:10,429
YOU KNOW, WE USUALLY
DON'T GET DAUGHTERS

967
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:12,431
PLANNING THEIR
MOTHERS' WEDDINGS.

968
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:13,665
OH, YEAH,

969
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:15,734
GRACE JUST REALLY
WANTS IT TO BE SPECIAL.

970
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:16,768
DON'T YOU?

971
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:17,936
YEAH, I...

972
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,305
HONESTLY, I WOULD HAVE
BEEN FINE

973
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:21,006
WITH A CEREMONY
IN THE COURTHOUSE,

974
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,276
BUT GRACE IS 20
AND STARRY-EYED.

975
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,377
WELL, YOU WERE 20
AND STARRY-EYED.

976
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:29,381
YEAH, IT'S WEIRD.

977
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:32,784
OUR KIDS ARE THE SAME AGE
WE WERE WHEN WE MET.

978
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:34,886
TO BE HONEST,
I'M FREAKING OUT

979
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,289
THAT JULIE'S GOING
AWAY TO COLLEGE.

980
00:37:37,323 --> 00:37:39,358
YEAH, WHEN GRACE
MOVED OUT,

981
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:41,960
I REDID HER ROOM
FOUR TIMES IN ONE WEEK.

982
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,962
AND I SLEPT
IN HER CHILDHOOD BED,

983
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:46,698
UNDER A POSTER
OF THE BACKSTREET BOYS.

984
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:48,467
OKAY, I'M NOT
DOING THAT.

985
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:55,441
IT'S FUNNY
HOW TIME FLIES.

986
00:37:55,474 --> 00:37:57,042
I STARTED DRINKING
HERBAL TEA

987
00:37:57,075 --> 00:37:58,544
AND POMEGRANATE JUICE.

988
00:37:58,577 --> 00:37:59,978
HMM, ANTIOXIDANTS.

989
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,680
OMEGA 3'S, GLUTEN?

990
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:03,982
OH, "GLUTEN,"
I HATE THAT WORD.

991
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,484
HOW ABOUT THIS,
"V.I.B.B.A."

992
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:06,585

1005
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,677
OH, EXCUSE ME.

1006
00:38:32,711 --> 00:38:33,812
JOSH!

1007
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:34,780
HEY, SWEETIE.

1008
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:35,847
HI.

1009
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:36,848
HOW'S IT GOING UP THERE?

1010
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:38,016
OH, IT'S GOOD.

1011
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,951
NOT THAT GOOD.

1012
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:41,420
REGULAR GOOD.

1013
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:42,721
DID YOU GET A CHANCE
TO TALK TO HIM YET?

1014
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:44,055
WE TALKED.

1015
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:45,724
UM...

1016
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:47,893
LISTEN, HONEY, I'M NOT
FEELING THAT COMFORTABLE

1017
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:49,127
BRINGING IT UP
IN THIS SITUATION.

1018
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,629
IS THAT HIM?

1019
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:54,700
UH...YEAH.

1020
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:55,734
PUT HIM ON.

1021
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:56,702
I'LL ASK HIM.

1022
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:58,837
OKAY.

1023
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:02,941

00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,046
UH, HEY, JOSH.

CONGRATULATIONS.

1026
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,115
WELL, THANKS.

1027
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:11,082
I HEARD YOUR PLACE
IS FANTASTIC.

1028
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:12,083
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT.

1029
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:13,318
WELL, IT'S HERE WAITING.

1030
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,121
SO OLIVIA TELLS ME
THAT YOU TWO HAVE A HISTORY.

1031
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:17,956
ANCIENT HISTORY.

1032
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:20,926
I BELIEVE IN BEING UPFRONT ABOUT
THINGS, DON'T YOU?

1033
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:23,662
UH... SURE.

1034
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,163

00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:31,036
WHAT?

1038
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:32,203

00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:34,506
BUT IF YOU GIVE ME
THE LISTING, I'LL GUARANTEE IT.

1045
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,848
WELL... SURE, WHY NOT?

1046
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,551
THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT.

1047
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:46,718
I GOTTA JUMP ON THIS CALL.

1048
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:48,620
TELL OLIVIA I LOVE HER.

1049
00:39:56,795 --> 00:39:58,464
WHAT DID HE SAY?

1050
00:39:58,497 --> 00:39:59,865
UH...

1051
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:04,035
I LOVE YOU.

1052
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:07,873
HE LOVES YOU.

1053
00:40:16,715 --> 00:40:18,850
BRACE YOURSELF.

1054
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:19,985
I'M BRACED.

1055
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:21,853
WHAT'S SHE GOT
TO CRITICIZE?

1056
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:22,921
SHE'LL FIND SOMETHING.

1057
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,992
HI, MOM.

1058
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:28,760
HI, GALS.

1059
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:31,129
AND YOU MUST
BE JOHNNY.

1060
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:33,599
JOHNNY, THIS IS
MY DAUGHTER, OLIVIA,

1061
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:35,100
THE BRIDE-TO-BE.

1062
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:36,101
AND THIS IS GRACE,

1063
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:37,469
MY GRANDDAUGHTER,

1064
00:40:37,503 --> 00:40:38,970
WHO WILL ALSO
BE A BRIDE ONE DAY.

1065
00:40:39,004 --> 00:40:41,673
NOT ANYTIME SOON, THOUGH.

1066
00:40:41,707 --> 00:40:42,908
WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW.

1067
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,643
MOM, ONE WEDDING
AT A TIME.

1068
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:46,177
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH
ABOUT YOU GIRLS.

1069
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:48,046
WHATEVER SHE SAID,
IT ISN'T TRUE.

1070
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,215
HOW WAS
YOUR DRIVE UP?

1071
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:52,951
OH, YOU KNOW,
UNEVENTFUL.

1072
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:54,486
FARMS, TREES.

1073
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,187
TREES, FARMS...

1074
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:57,689
AND NORA,
WHO SPOKE NON-STOP.

1075
00:40:57,723 --> 00:40:58,724
HEY!

1076
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:00,826
EXCUSE ME, LADIES.

1077
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:02,961
I'M GONNA HAVE
A LOOK AT THIS LAKE.

1078
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:04,763
AND MAYBE EVEN
JUMP IN.

1079
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:05,797
YOU DO THAT.

1080
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:06,865
MM...

1081
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:11,269
MOM...

1082
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,571
I LIKE HIM.

1083
00:41:12,604 --> 00:41:13,905
ME TOO.

1084
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:15,974
YEAH, I THINK
HE MIGHT BE A KEEPER.

1085
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:17,075
LET'S SEE THIS PLACE.

1086
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:24,616
OH.

1087
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,284
NICE...

1088
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,086
VERY NICE.

1089
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:29,555
ISN'T IT?

1090
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:31,256
WOW.

1091
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:32,891
I ASSUME YOU'VE PICKED OUT
ALL YOUR PLACE SETTINGS,

1092
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,526
AND FLOWERS, AND CAKE?

1093
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,861
PLACE SETTINGS, SILVER.

1094
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:37,262
FLOWERS, LILIES.

1095
00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:38,229
CAKE, LEMON.

1096
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:40,298
LEMON.

1097
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,232
WHO CHOSE THAT?

1098
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,168
I DID.

1099
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:45,103
HONEY, NO ONE HAS LEMON
AT A WEDDING.

1100
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:46,104
MOM...

1101
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,138
I LIKE IT.

1102
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:48,874
LEMONS ARE SOUR.

1103
00:41:48,907 --> 00:41:50,308
IS THAT HOW YOU WANT
TO START YOUR MARRIAGE?

1104
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,610
IT'S A CAKE, MOM.

1105
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:52,611
IT'S NOT LIFE.

1106
00:41:53,779 --> 00:41:54,913
WELCOME.

1107
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:56,815
MOM, YOU REMEMBER

1108
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,249
MICK TURNER.

1109
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:02,888
YES, OF COURSE, I DO.

1110
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:05,757
WAIT, YOU DIDN'T
INVITE HIM TO YOUR WEDDING?

1111
00:42:05,791 --> 00:42:07,626
HE OWNS THE INN.

1112
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:10,128
YOU LOOK GREAT, MRS. PHILLIPS.

1113
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:11,730
IT'S MS. WINTERS, ACTUALLY.

1114
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:13,699
OH, CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU REMARRIED.

1115
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:15,133
TWICE AND COUNTING.

1116
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:16,134
ONE KEEPS
DOING SOMETHING

1117
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:17,936
UNTIL THEY
GET IT RIGHT.

1118
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:19,270
I SEE.

1119
00:42:19,304 --> 00:42:21,139
AND OBVIOUSLY,
YOU'VE GIVEN UP THE MUSIC.

1120
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,876
MICK IS OUR WEDDING SINGER.

1121
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,277
OH...

1122
00:42:26,311 --> 00:42:28,213
THAT MUST BE SUCH
A COMEDOWN FOR YOU.

1123
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:30,548
NOT REALLY.

1124
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:32,984
I'M GOING TO
MAKE SURE

1125
00:42:33,018 --> 00:42:34,085
YOUR LUGGAGE
GETS TO YOUR ROOM.

1126
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:35,787
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

1127
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:41,827
MOM...

1128
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,862
YOU COULD BE A LITTLE NICER.

1129
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:45,797
I NEVER LIKED THAT BOY.

1130
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:47,298
HE'S HARDLY A BOY.

1131
00:42:47,332 --> 00:42:48,634
HE'S JUST LIKE
YOUR FATHER WAS,

1132
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:51,870
RUNNING AFTER...
SOME DREAM.

1133
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,672
MOM, IT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO.

1134
00:42:53,705 --> 00:42:55,707
HE BROKE YOUR HEART.

1135
00:42:55,741 --> 00:42:57,242
A MOTHER NEVER GETS OVER THAT.

1136
00:42:57,275 --> 00:42:59,110
I GOT OVER IT.

1137
00:42:59,144 --> 00:43:00,211
WELL, WE'LL SEE
HOW YOU FEEL

1138
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:02,981
WHEN SOME BOY WITH A GUITAR
BREAKS GRACE'S HEART.

1139
00:43:05,884 --> 00:43:08,019
NORA...

1140
00:43:09,354 --> 00:43:10,789
COME ON,
LET'S GO FOR A WALK.

1141
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:12,290
OH. OKAY.

1142
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:15,060
A LONG WALK.

1143
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,962
THANK YOU.

1144
00:43:18,129 --> 00:43:19,064
DID YOU SWIM?

1145
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,966
NO, NO.

1146
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:26,772
WHAT'S THAT?

1147
00:43:26,805 --> 00:43:29,240
OH, IT'S JUST SOME JUNK MAIL.

1148
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:31,176
DAD...

1149
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:32,978
I KNOW YOU'RE
SELLING THE PLACE.

1150
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:38,650
I'M SORRY, HONEY.

1151
00:43:38,684 --> 00:43:39,785
I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU.

1152
00:43:39,818 --> 00:43:40,819
I WAS JUST WAITING
FOR THE RIGHT TIME.

1153
00:43:40,852 --> 00:43:42,287
IT'S OKAY.

1154
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,254
I'M FINE WITH IT.

1155
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:44,956
YOU ARE?

1156
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,725
THE PLACE IS TOO BIG,
AND IT'S TOO MUCH WORK.

1157
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,432
I JUST KEEP THINKING ABOUT...

1158
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,167
ALL OUR MEMORIES HERE.

1159
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:58,003
WE'LL MAKE NEW ONES.

1160
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:00,271
YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

1161
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:01,940
I'M SURE.

1162
00:44:05,877 --> 00:44:07,245
OH, YOUR STUDENTS ARE HERE.

1163
00:44:07,278 --> 00:44:08,980
THEY'RE SETTING UP
IN THE GARAGE.

1164
00:44:09,014 --> 00:44:11,216
I THINK WE'LL GO
A CAPPELLA TODAY.

1165
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:12,851
THAT'S NOT
LIKE YOU.

1166
00:44:12,884 --> 00:44:14,352
YOU DON'T KNOW OLIVIA'S MOTHER.

1167
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:16,354
SHE DOESN'T LIKE MUSIC?

1168
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:18,890
SHE DOESN'T
LIKE MY MUSIC.

1169
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:27,465
LET'S START WITH
"LONELY NIGHT," OKAY?

1170
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,068
WE'LL JUST DO
THE CHORUS IN UNISON.

1171
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:31,336
ON ONE,

1172
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:33,271

1211
00:46:12,137 --> 00:46:14,139
I FOUND THEM
A LONG TIME AGO,

1212
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:17,175
BUT I NEVER KNEW WHO
THEY WERE UNTIL NOW.

1213
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:18,409
WHY DO YOU THINK

1214
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:20,178
THEY NEVER TALKED
ABOUT EACH OTHER?

1215
00:46:20,211 --> 00:46:23,081
MAYBE THE MEMORIES
WERE TOO PAINFUL.

1216
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:24,282
OR TOO GOOD.

1217
00:46:26,852 --> 00:46:30,555

TO LOSE HER AGAIN.

1218

HI.

1222
00:46:53,378 --> 00:46:55,513
THAT WAS... AMAZING.

1223
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:57,082
YOU CAME EARLY.

1224
00:46:57,115 --> 00:46:58,516
I MISSED YOU.

1225
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:01,386
THIS IS
STILL YOU, RIGHT?

1226
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:02,520
YEAH, THAT WAS THE OLD ME.

1227
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:03,621

YOU MADE IT.

1231
00:47:09,961 --> 00:47:11,196

00:47:29,114 --> 00:47:30,148
OH, THANK YOU.

1243
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:31,116
IT WON'T LAST
THE WEEKEND.

1244
00:47:31,149 --> 00:47:32,183
I MAY NOT EITHER.

1245
00:47:32,217 --> 00:47:34,585
HARD COPIES.

1246
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:36,321
SIGNATURE PAGES
ARE MARKED.

1247
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:37,488
GREAT.

1248
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:38,990

1249
00:47:39,024 --> 00:47:42,060
WELL, I'LL... GIVE YOU GUYS
SOME PRIVACY.

1250
00:47:42,093 --> 00:47:43,094
HEY, GUYS, THAT'S A WRAP
FOR TODAY, OKAY?

1251
00:47:43,128 --> 00:47:44,029
WE'LL PICK IT UP HERE
NEXT WEEK.

1252
00:47:44,062 --> 00:47:46,231
GREAT JOB.

1253
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,473
FOR PUTTING UP WITH ME.

1254
00:47:55,506 --> 00:47:58,676
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL, HONEY,
BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

1255
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,211
YES. I DID.

1256
00:48:00,245 --> 00:48:02,680
I SHOULD HAVE
BEEN HERE YESTERDAY.

1257
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:06,051
WELL, YOU'RE HERE NOW.

1258
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:12,991
HEY.

1259
00:48:13,024 --> 00:48:14,392
IS THAT HIM?

1260
00:48:14,425 --> 00:48:16,261
YEAH.

1261
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:17,428
HE LOOKS...

1262
00:48:17,462 --> 00:48:19,064
LIKE A DECENT GUY?

1263
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:21,666
IF I DIDN'T
KNOW BETTER,

1264
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:22,600
I WOULD THINK
THAT YOU WERE--

1265
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:24,069
DON'T SAY "JEALOUS."

1266
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:25,136
I WAS GOING TO SAY

1267
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:26,104
"HAVING FEELINGS
FOR HER AGAIN."

1268
00:48:26,137 --> 00:48:27,672
DON'T SAY THAT
EITHER!

1269
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:34,279
BUYERS LOVE
CELEBRITY PROPERTIES.

1270
00:48:34,312 --> 00:48:37,382
I THINK WE SHOULD PLAY UP
THE POP STAR ANGLE.

1271
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:39,050
DO WE REALLY
HAVE TO DO THAT?

1272
00:48:39,084 --> 00:48:40,618
WELL, I ONCE SOLD A HOUSE
FOR DOUBLE THE COMPS,

1273
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:41,953
JUST BECAUSE
A REAL HOUSEWIFE,

1274
00:48:41,987 --> 00:48:43,554
WHO SHALL
REMAIN NAMELESS,

1275
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:45,490
USED TO LIVE THERE.

1276
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:48,159
WOW...

1277
00:48:48,193 --> 00:48:50,028
WHAT A ROOM.

1278
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:51,229
OH, THANK YOU.

1279
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:54,032
I RESTORED IT TO
ITS ORIGINAL STATE.

1280
00:48:54,065 --> 00:48:57,135
I'D SAY WE STAGE IT,
AND WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

1281
00:48:57,168 --> 00:48:59,737
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY LIKE IT
THE WAY IT IS.

1282
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,572
IT HAS CHARACTER.

1283
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:02,640
IT FEELS RIGHT.

1284
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:04,575
FOR A COUNTRY INN.

1285
00:49:06,077 --> 00:49:09,080
IT IS A COUNTRY INN.

1286
00:49:09,114 --> 00:49:10,448
NOW.

1287
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:12,350
NOT THAT YOUR PLACE
ISN'T AMAZING,

1288
00:49:12,383 --> 00:49:14,019
BECAUSE IT IS.

1289
00:49:14,052 --> 00:49:14,919
BUT THE WALL STREETERS
AND THE TECHIES

1290
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,588
REALLY GO FOR
THOSE CLEAN MODERN LINES,

1291
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:19,290
AND THAT IS OUR TARGET MARKET.

1292
00:49:19,324 --> 00:49:21,192
DON'T WORRY,

1293
00:49:21,226 --> 00:49:23,061
OLIVIA IS THE BEST.

1294
00:49:24,395 --> 00:49:26,231
LUCKY, COME ON,
GET OUT OF HERE.

1295
00:49:26,264 --> 00:49:28,433
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
GO ON, COME ON, COME ON.

1296
00:49:33,371 --> 00:49:35,040
UH, SORRY,

1297
00:49:35,073 --> 00:49:36,507
JOSH ISN'T REALLY
A DOG PERSON.

1298
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:37,708
I WAS ATTACKED

1299
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:39,444
AT AN OPEN HOUSE
BY A POODLE.

1300
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:40,445
A TOY POODLE.

1301
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:49,754
I THINK I HAVE IT
FIGURED OUT.

1302
00:49:49,787 --> 00:49:52,323
SHOULD I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EXACTLY?

1303
00:49:52,357 --> 00:49:54,259
THAT WHOLE SOMETHING OLD,
SOMETHING NEW--

1304
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:55,293
SOMETHING BORROWED--

1305
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,395
SOMETHING BLUE.

1306
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:00,331
HERE'S THE OLD.

1307
00:50:00,365 --> 00:50:01,666
WHAT'S THAT?

1308
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:03,468
IT'S ONE OF
MY GRANDMOTHER'S VEILS.

1309
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,136
SHE KNEW MY MOM
WOULDN'T WEAR IT,

1310
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:07,238
BUT THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD
SNEAK IT IN SOMEHOW.

1311
00:50:07,272 --> 00:50:08,606
SHE'S CRAFTY.

1312
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:10,075
SO AM I,

1313
00:50:10,108 --> 00:50:11,576
AND DEVIOUS.

1314
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:12,677
SO, WHAT'S THE "NEW"?

1315
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:15,080
I BOUGHT HER AN ANKLET.

1316
00:50:15,113 --> 00:50:17,115
I'LL GIVE IT TO HER
THE DAY OF THE WEDDING.

1317
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:18,349
THEN YOU JUST NEED
SOMETHING BORROWED.

1318
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:21,419
GOT IT.

1319
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:23,254
SHOULD I ASK?

1320
00:50:23,288 --> 00:50:25,056
MAYBE YOU SHOULD READ.

1321
00:50:29,794 --> 00:50:31,196
"YOU AND ME

1322
00:50:31,229 --> 00:50:32,730
"ON AN OPEN ROAD

1323
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:34,799
"THE STARS ALIGN
AND THEY GUIDE US ON

1324
00:50:34,832 --> 00:50:36,067
"BUT WHEREVER WE GO

1325
00:50:36,101 --> 00:50:37,835
WE ARE HOME."

1326
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,670
I LOVE IT,
WHERE'S IT FROM?

1327
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:41,172
MY MOM WROTE IT.

1328
00:50:41,206 --> 00:50:42,540
SHE'S REALLY GOOD.

1329
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:43,608
LIKE MY DAD.

1330
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:46,077
SHE WROTE IT FOR YOUR DAD.

1331
00:50:46,111 --> 00:50:48,079
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

1332
00:50:48,113 --> 00:50:49,080
AND THERE'S MORE.

1333
00:50:49,114 --> 00:50:50,115
HOW MUCH MORE?

1334
00:50:50,148 --> 00:50:51,416
AN ENTIRE BOX FULL.

1335
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:52,617
DUKE SHOWED ME.

1336
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:54,219
DON'T TELL HIM
I TOLD YOU.

1337
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:58,656
I HAD NO CLUE.

1338
00:50:58,689 --> 00:51:01,092
BUT IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

1339
00:51:01,126 --> 00:51:03,728
YOU'VE SEEN
HOW THEY'VE BEEN ACTING.

1340
00:51:03,761 --> 00:51:05,830
I DON'T THINK
IT'S AS LONG AGO AS WE THINK.

1341
00:51:05,863 --> 00:51:08,566
AND SO YOU'RE PUTTING THIS
IN HER BOUQUET BECAUSE?

1342
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:09,767
I'M CRAFTY.

1343
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,169
AND DEVIOUS.

1344
00:51:11,202 --> 00:51:13,171
I KNOW YOU SEE IT.

1345
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:14,139
RIGHT?

1346
00:51:15,206 --> 00:51:16,141
I DO.

1347
00:51:17,675 --> 00:51:19,577
SO, WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

1348
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:22,113
WE WAIT.

1349
00:51:22,147 --> 00:51:24,682
AND HOPE
NATURE TAKES ITS COURSE.

1350
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,661
WOW.

1351
00:51:36,694 --> 00:51:38,796
IT IS BEAUTIFUL
OUT HERE, ISN'T IT?

1352
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,365
INCREDIBLE.

1353
00:51:40,398 --> 00:51:42,833
I WONDER WHAT
THE LAKEFRONT FOOTAGE IS?

1354
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:45,670
JUST KIDDING.

1355
00:51:47,405 --> 00:51:48,373
NO REAL ESTATE TALK.

1356
00:51:48,406 --> 00:51:49,774
NO REAL ESTATE TALK.

1357
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:56,181
MAYBE GRACE WAS RIGHT.

1358
00:51:56,214 --> 00:51:57,215
ABOUT WHAT?

1359
00:51:57,248 --> 00:51:58,283
WE'RE UNROMANTIC.

1360
00:51:58,316 --> 00:51:59,784
WE'RE NOT UNROMANTIC.

1361
00:51:59,817 --> 00:52:01,686
I MEAN, LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE.

1362
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:06,591
AND WE'RE GETTING
MARRIED IN, UM...

1363
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:10,561
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED
IN 46 HOURS AND 20 MINUTES.

1364
00:52:10,595 --> 00:52:13,398
YOU SET A REMINDER
FOR OUR WEDDING?

1365
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:14,632
DIDN'T WANT TO MISS IT.

1366
00:52:16,534 --> 00:52:18,369
HEY...

1367
00:52:18,403 --> 00:52:20,471
THIS IS US.

1368
00:52:22,407 --> 00:52:24,475
YEAH.

1369
00:52:24,509 --> 00:52:26,811
THIS IS US.

1370
00:52:28,413 --> 00:52:30,615
I WONDER HOW FAR
THIS PATH GOES?

1371
00:52:32,217 --> 00:52:33,584
LET'S FIND OUT.

1372
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:35,586
OH, HANG ON.

1373
00:52:36,787 --> 00:52:37,855
WHAT IS IT?

1374
00:52:39,457 --> 00:52:40,658
IT'S NOTHING.

1375
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:43,594
I KNOW THAT LOOK.

1376
00:52:43,628 --> 00:52:44,962
LOCAL BROKERS.

1377
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,364
AND?

1378
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:48,699
WITH A TON
OF CLIENT ACCESS.

1379
00:52:48,733 --> 00:52:49,667
BUT IT CAN WAIT.

1380
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,402
COME ON,

1381
00:52:51,436 --> 00:52:52,837
I'LL RACE YOU AROUND THE LAKE.

1382
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:54,839
HEY...

1383
00:52:58,309 --> 00:53:00,378
GO AHEAD, GO MEET 'EM.

1384
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:04,915
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

1385
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:06,083
YEAH.

1386
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:08,286
I MEAN, THE LAKE'S GOING TO
BE HERE WHEN YOU GET BACK,

1387
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:09,587
AND SO WILL I.

1388
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,489
WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH ME?

1389
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:12,957
THEN WE CAN GRAB A BITE
IN TOWN AFTER.

1390
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,559
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT,

1391
00:53:14,592 --> 00:53:15,693
I THINK I'D RATHER
JUST STAY HERE.

1392
00:53:15,726 --> 00:53:16,627
ARE YOU SURE?

1393
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,796
YEAH.

1394
00:53:19,997 --> 00:53:20,931
LOVE YOU.

1395
00:53:22,267 --> 00:53:23,634
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

1396
00:53:25,303 --> 00:53:27,004
I'LL BE GONE,
LIKE, AN HOUR.

1397
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,739
TWO, TOPS.

1398
00:53:30,608 --> 00:53:32,343
NO BIKING AND TEXTING.

1399
00:53:48,926 --> 00:53:50,428
I KNEW IT.

1400
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:51,796
YOU OWE ME FIVE BUCKS.

1401
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:03,274
SO, WHAT'S THE PLAN
AFTER YOU SELL THIS PLACE?

1402
00:54:03,308 --> 00:54:04,709
YOU'RE GOING TO OPEN
YOUR RESTAURANT.

1403
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:06,477
AND WHAT, YOU'LL BE
MY MAITRE D'?

1404
00:54:06,511 --> 00:54:08,313
MAYBE.

1405
00:54:08,346 --> 00:54:09,514
SO, YOU HAVEN'T REALLY
THOUGHT THIS THOUGH A LOT,

1406
00:54:09,547 --> 00:54:10,481
HAVE YOU?

1407
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,651
JUST PLAYING IT BY EAR.

1408
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:15,052
LIKE IN THE OLD DAYS.

1409
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,822
WHEN YOU USED TO
TAKE CHANCES.

1410
00:54:19,424 --> 00:54:20,358
I'M JUST SAYING,

1411
00:54:20,391 --> 00:54:22,893
YOU USED TO GO AFTER
THE THINGS YOU WANTED.

1412
00:54:32,837 --> 00:54:33,804
OH!

1413
00:54:35,573 --> 00:54:37,041
OH.

1414
00:54:44,515 --> 00:54:45,850
I THINK I LIKE THIS ONE.

1415
00:54:49,687 --> 00:54:50,955
HEY, MOM,
YOU'RE ON SPEAKER PHONE.

1416
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:51,989
HI, HONEY, UM...

1417
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:53,023
I'M ON THE LAKE PATH,

1418
00:54:53,057 --> 00:54:54,859
AND MY CHAIN SLIPPED OFF.

1419
00:54:54,892 --> 00:54:56,160
I'M NOT REALLY SURE
HOW TO FIX IT,

1420
00:54:56,193 --> 00:54:57,962
SO I'M GOING TO BE JUST
A LITTLE LATE GETTING BACK.

1421
00:54:57,995 --> 00:54:58,896
I'LL SEND SOMEONE.

1422
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:01,399
NO, NO, NO, DON'T BE SILLY,
I CAN WALK.

1423
00:55:01,432 --> 00:55:02,867
WE GOT THIS.

1424
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:06,504
HOW FAR DO YOU
THINK SHE GOT?

1425
00:55:06,537 --> 00:55:07,838
FAR ENOUGH.

1426
00:55:09,507 --> 00:55:11,308
DAD, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING RIGHT NOW?

1427
00:55:20,785 --> 00:55:21,752
HEY.

1428
00:55:22,853 --> 00:55:24,088
OH, HEY.

1429
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:25,390
SORRY.

1430
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:27,091
NO, IT HAPPENS
ALL THE TIME.

1431
00:55:27,124 --> 00:55:29,126
WELL, THANK YOU.

1432
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,596
WELL, YOU CAN JUST
CONSIDER THIS

1433
00:55:31,629 --> 00:55:32,830
PART OF
THE CONCIERGE SERVICE.

1434
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:34,064
THANKS.

1435
00:55:35,566 --> 00:55:37,101
OH, YEAH.

1436
00:55:37,134 --> 00:55:38,836
CHAINS ARE TRICKY.

1437
00:55:38,869 --> 00:55:39,937
YEAH.

1438
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:43,408
OF ALL THE PLACES FOR YOU
TO PEDAL INTO,

1439
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:44,842
YOU HAD TO PEDAL INTO MINE, HUH?

1440
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:46,110
YEAH.

1441
00:55:46,143 --> 00:55:48,646
WELL, WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE
THAT THIRD-FLOOR DORM.

1442
00:55:49,814 --> 00:55:51,115
-YEAH.
-YEAH.

1443
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,418
THERE YOU GO.

1444
00:55:53,451 --> 00:55:54,652
THANK YOU.

1445
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:56,387
AS LONG AS
YOU'RE OUT HERE,

1446
00:55:56,421 --> 00:55:57,422
THERE'S A PLACE
A LITTLE FURTHER ALONG

1447
00:55:57,455 --> 00:55:58,523
THAT'S PRETTY SPECIAL,

1448
00:55:58,556 --> 00:55:59,790
IF YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IT.

1449
00:56:01,526 --> 00:56:02,760
SURE.

1450
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:03,861
WHY NOT?

1451
00:56:06,797 --> 00:56:08,065
FOLLOW ME.

1452
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,846
WOW.

1453
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:25,149
TOLD YOU
IT WAS SPECIAL.

1454
00:56:25,182 --> 00:56:28,619
IT IS BEAUTIFUL.

1455
00:56:28,653 --> 00:56:29,987
YEAH.

1456
00:56:32,523 --> 00:56:36,461
I THINK THIS IS
OFFICIALLY MY FAVORITE PLACE.

1457
00:56:36,494 --> 00:56:38,729
MINE TOO.

1458
00:56:40,498 --> 00:56:42,600
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
I'M SAYING GOODBYE,

1459
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:44,769
AND YOU'RE SAYING "I DO."

1460
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:49,173
NOW, THAT
COULD BE A SONG.

1461
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:58,916
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO LET GO OF ALL THIS?

1462
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:01,752
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT
A LOT OF THINGS, LIVVY.

1463
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:05,990
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
THE INN, RIGHT?

1464
00:57:06,023 --> 00:57:07,992
I DON'T KNOW, ARE WE?

1465
00:57:10,027 --> 00:57:11,128
I'M NOT FALLING FOR THIS AGAIN.

1466
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:12,162
FALLING FOR WHAT?

1467
00:57:12,196 --> 00:57:13,263
FOR YOU.

1468
00:57:13,297 --> 00:57:15,633
WELL, I REMEMBER YOU WERE
PRETTY HAPPY WITH ME ONCE.

1469
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:16,967
I REMEMBER THE TAIL-LIGHTS
OF YOUR VAN

1470
00:57:17,001 --> 00:57:18,168
AS YOU DROVE AWAY.

1471
00:57:18,202 --> 00:57:20,037
OH, COME ON, I HAD A TOUR.

1472
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,205
YOU PROMISED
YOU'D COME BACK FOR ME.

1473
00:57:21,238 --> 00:57:22,540
I DID.

1474
00:57:22,573 --> 00:57:24,809
OH, SORRY FOR NOT WAITING
TWO DECADES.

1475
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:26,110
TWO DECADES?

1476
00:57:26,143 --> 00:57:27,512
IT WAS SIX MONTHS AT THE MOST.

1477
00:57:27,545 --> 00:57:28,746
AND YOU WERE ALREADY
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

1478
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:30,247
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1479
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,982
YOU DIDN'T COME BACK FOR ME.

1480
00:57:32,016 --> 00:57:33,250
YEAH, I DID.

1481
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,218
I WENT TO YOUR DORM.

1482
00:57:34,251 --> 00:57:35,953
YOUR ROOMMATE SAID
THAT YOU'D MET SOMEONE.

1483
00:57:35,986 --> 00:57:37,221
MY ROOMMATE?

1484
00:57:37,254 --> 00:57:39,056
MY-- WHY WOULD YOU
BELIEVE HER?

1485
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:40,625
WELL, WHY WOULDN'T I?

1486
00:57:40,658 --> 00:57:42,092
BECAUSE SHE HAD A CRUSH ON YOU,

1487
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:43,928
AND SHE WAS
A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR,

1488
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:45,663
AND IF YOU HADN'T
GIVEN UP SO EASY,

1489
00:57:45,696 --> 00:57:48,165
YOU WOULD HAVE FOUND OUT
THAT I WAS HEARTBROKEN.

1490
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:54,572
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO THIS. I...

1491
00:57:57,708 --> 00:57:59,710
NOTHING.

1492
00:57:59,744 --> 00:58:01,512
I'M GOING BACK.

1493
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:08,753
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS WEDDING
TO BE OVER.

1494
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,767
WHAT DOES IT NEED?

1495
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,801
NOTHING.

1496
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:25,736
IT'S PERFECT.

1497
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:26,937
WELL, THANK YOU,

1498
00:58:26,971 --> 00:58:28,973
BUT THAT'S NOT VERY HELPFUL.

1499
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:31,942
EVERYTHING YOU'RE PREPARING
IS AMAZING.

1500
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,613
IT CAN ALWAYS BE BETTER.

1501
00:58:35,646 --> 00:58:37,247
TRY THE SAUCE
THAT GOES WITH THIS.

1502
00:58:44,088 --> 00:58:46,657
AND?

1503
00:58:46,691 --> 00:58:48,859
ARE YOU GOING TO BE MAD
IF I SAY "AMAZING?"

1504
00:58:48,893 --> 00:58:51,962
-YEAH.
-THEN NO COMMENT.

1505
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:55,132
YOU ARE LIKE YOUR MOM,

1506
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:56,901
VERY SWEET.

1507
00:58:56,934 --> 00:58:58,803
TRY IT AGAIN.

1508
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:03,974
IT'S BETTER, RIGHT?

1509
00:59:04,008 --> 00:59:05,275
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

1510
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:06,577
WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?

1511
00:59:06,611 --> 00:59:09,146
DON'T EVER SETTLE.

1512
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:11,181
LIFE'S TOO SHORT, GRACE.

1513
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:14,018
WE'RE STILL TALKING
FOOD, YEAH?

1514
00:59:16,721 --> 00:59:20,190
YOU DON'T THINK SHE SHOULD
MARRY JOSH EITHER, DO YOU?

1515
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:23,027
WHAT I THINK...

1516
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,329
IS THAT IT CAN ALWAYS BE BETTER.

1517
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,565
MM.

1518
00:59:31,201 --> 00:59:32,737
MM-HMM.

1519
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:36,907
HEY...

1520
00:59:36,941 --> 00:59:38,609
OH, HI.

1521
00:59:38,643 --> 00:59:39,777
I'M SORRY,

1522
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:41,145
I KNOW THIS WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE

1523
00:59:41,178 --> 00:59:42,246
A WEEKEND WITHOUT
AN OPEN HOUSE.

1524
00:59:42,279 --> 00:59:45,182
OH, HONEY, WHAT'S A WEEKEND
WITHOUT AN OPEN HOUSE?

1525
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:47,351
AFTER THE WEDDING,
WE'LL TAKE SOME TIME OFF.

1526
00:59:47,384 --> 00:59:49,119
YOU MEAN A HONEYMOON?

1527
00:59:49,153 --> 00:59:50,054
NOT THAT MUCH TIME.

1528
00:59:51,155 --> 00:59:52,990
YES, A HONEYMOON.

1529
00:59:53,023 --> 00:59:55,092
NO CELL PHONES,
OR SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLINGS?

1530
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:56,093
DONE.

1531
00:59:56,126 --> 00:59:57,962
I HAVE TO HEAD INTO TOWN
AND PICK UP THE SIGNS.

1532
00:59:57,995 --> 00:59:59,063
YOU GOT THIS?

1533
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:00,230
OH, I GOT THIS.

1534
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:02,833
SEE YOU SOON.

1535
01:00:02,867 --> 01:00:03,634
OKAY.

1536
01:00:06,671 --> 01:00:08,172
-MORNING, GRACE.
-GOOD MORNING, JOSH.

1537
01:00:08,205 --> 01:00:09,139
REHEARSAL DINNER
TONIGHT.

1538
01:00:09,173 --> 01:00:10,174
GOT IT.

1539
01:00:10,207 --> 01:00:11,175
DON'T GO TOO FAR!

1540
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:12,042
WOULDN'T
DREAM OF IT!

1541
01:00:12,076 --> 01:00:14,078
WORST GROOM EVER.

1542
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:15,946
SO, WHERE'S HE OFF TO?

1543
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,014
OH, IT'S OKAY.

1544
01:00:17,047 --> 01:00:18,215
OPEN HOUSE.
HE'LL BE BACK.

1545
01:00:18,248 --> 01:00:20,417
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK,
AREA RUG, YES OR NO?

1546
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,652
I LIKE THE RUG.

1547
01:00:21,686 --> 01:00:22,720
YEAH, I DO, TOO.

1548
01:00:22,753 --> 01:00:23,888
I MEAN, IT DOESN'T
SAY "WALL STREET,"

1549
01:00:23,921 --> 01:00:25,255
BUT... IT STAYS.

1550
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,068
GUILT-INDUCING?

1551
01:00:42,272 --> 01:00:44,274
LET'S LEAVE THIS
THE WAY IT IS.

1552
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:45,175
YOU KNOW, UM...

1553
01:00:45,209 --> 01:00:48,112
MAYBE A LITTLE
SENTIMENTALITY IS GOOD.

1554
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:51,048
BUYERS CAN SEE
THAT PEOPLE WERE HAPPY HERE.

1555
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:52,750
I HAVE TO SAY,

1556
01:00:52,783 --> 01:00:54,785
I LIKE WHAT YOU'VE
DONE WITH THE PLACE.

1557
01:00:54,819 --> 01:00:56,420
I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING.

1558
01:00:56,453 --> 01:00:57,822
EXACTLY.

1559
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:02,192
GOOD MORNING, MICK.

1560
01:01:02,226 --> 01:01:04,061
MORNING, LADIES.

1561
01:01:04,094 --> 01:01:06,764
MORNING.

1562
01:01:06,797 --> 01:01:09,867
YOU DON'T...
NEED ANYTHING FROM ME, RIGHT?

1563
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,268
NO.

1564
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:12,837
NOT A THING.

1565
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:20,310
YOU READY?

1566
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:22,112
YEAH.

1567
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,857
OKAY, UH...
WHERE WERE WE?

1568
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:34,158
AS I RECALL,

1569
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:36,827
WE WERE LEAVING EVERYTHING
EXACTLY AS IT WAS.

1570
01:01:36,861 --> 01:01:39,229
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

1571
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:44,935
MOM...

1572
01:01:44,969 --> 01:01:46,336
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED?

1573
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:47,905
WHAT?

1574
01:01:47,938 --> 01:01:50,140
IT'S JUST...

1575
01:01:50,174 --> 01:01:51,776
YOU'RE DIFFERENT AROUND HIM.

1576
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:53,710
HIM?

1577
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,783
WELL, IF I AM,

1578
01:01:58,816 --> 01:02:01,819
IT'S JUST BECAUSE HE BRINGS OUT
THE WORST IN ME.

1579
01:02:01,852 --> 01:02:03,387
OR THE BEST.

1580
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,388
HONEY, I'M JUST

1581
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:06,957
TRYING TO GET THROUGH
AN AWKWARD SITUATION.

1582
01:02:06,991 --> 01:02:09,493
IT WOULDN'T BE AWKWARD
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE FEELINGS.

1583
01:02:11,195 --> 01:02:13,263
NOW, THAT--
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

1584
01:02:13,297 --> 01:02:14,264
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

1585
01:02:14,298 --> 01:02:15,265
MY WEDDING PLANNER.

1586
01:02:15,299 --> 01:02:17,201
I'M ALSO YOUR DAUGHTER.

1587
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,810
AH!

1588
01:02:25,843 --> 01:02:27,144
WE SHOULD JOIN
THE WEEKEND TOURNAMENT

1589
01:02:27,177 --> 01:02:28,478
AT THE CLUB.

1590
01:02:28,512 --> 01:02:30,848
YEAH, MAYBE...

1591
01:02:30,881 --> 01:02:33,017
YOU SEEM DISTRACTED.

1592
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:34,218
I'M HAVING
A LITTLE TROUBLE

1593
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:36,086
MOVING ON, I GUESS.

1594
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,856
FROM THE INN, OR HER?

1595
01:02:38,889 --> 01:02:41,391
THE INN.

1596
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:43,260
WELL, SHE'S GETTING MARRIED
TOMORROW, RIGHT?

1597
01:02:43,293 --> 01:02:44,962
YEAH.

1598
01:02:44,995 --> 01:02:46,196
OKAY, WELL THEN,
PROBLEM SOLVED.

1599
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,798
YOU'LL NEVER HAVE
TO SEE HER AGAIN.

1600
01:02:47,832 --> 01:02:50,835
OUT OF SIGHT,
OUT OF MIND.

1601
01:02:50,868 --> 01:02:52,136
YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU SELL THE INN,

1602
01:02:52,169 --> 01:02:53,403
WE SHOULD DO
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

1603
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:55,505
LIKE A WEEKEND AWAY SOMEWHERE?

1604
01:02:55,539 --> 01:02:57,074
A WEEKEND?

1605
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:58,375
OR A WEEK.

1606
01:02:58,408 --> 01:03:01,011
I MEAN, WHEN IS THE LAST TIME
YOU JUST WENT TRAVELING AROUND?

1607
01:03:01,045 --> 01:03:02,813
A LONG TIME AGO,

1608
01:03:02,847 --> 01:03:04,448
AND IT WAS ON A TOUR BUS.

1609
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:07,284
WELL, I'M THINKING MORE...

1610
01:03:07,317 --> 01:03:09,153
HOTEL, AIRPLANE,

1611
01:03:09,186 --> 01:03:11,321
SANDY BEACH.

1612
01:03:17,594 --> 01:03:19,964
THIS COULD BE A SWEET
CORPORATE RETREAT.

1613
01:03:19,997 --> 01:03:21,131
IF WE GUT IT, YEAH.

1614
01:03:21,165 --> 01:03:22,366
EXACTLY WHAT
I WAS THINKING.

1615
01:03:22,399 --> 01:03:23,167
WAIT TILL YOU SEE
THE OUTSIDE.

1616
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,569
800 FEET
OF PRIMETIME LAKEFRONT.

1617
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:31,441
I'VE NEVER BEEN
TO AN OPEN HOUSE.

1618
01:03:31,475 --> 01:03:33,610
I'VE BEEN TO TOO MANY.

1619
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,913
LOOKS LIKE
A BIG TURNOUT.

1620
01:03:35,946 --> 01:03:36,947
AT LEAST
HALF OF THEM ARE HERE

1621
01:03:36,981 --> 01:03:38,015
JUST TO SEE THE PLACE,

1622
01:03:38,048 --> 01:03:40,450
AND MAYBE GRAB
SOME FREE FOOD.

1623
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:41,852
IT'S THE OTHER HALF
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

1624
01:03:43,954 --> 01:03:45,022
IT'S WEIRD

1625
01:03:45,055 --> 01:03:46,456
THINKING ABOUT THIS PLACE
BELONGING TO SOMEONE ELSE.

1626
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:48,058
OR A CORPORATION.

1627
01:03:48,092 --> 01:03:50,194
THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE
IT WON'T SELL,

1628
01:03:50,227 --> 01:03:52,262
ALTHOUGH WITH
A PROPERTY LIKE THIS...

1629
01:03:52,296 --> 01:03:53,597
HOW GOOD A SALESMAN IS JOSH?

1630
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:57,001
HE SOLD MY MOM ON MARRIAGE,
SO I'D SAY GOOD.

1631
01:03:58,402 --> 01:04:01,305
I'D BETTER START
GETTING USED TO THE IDEA.

1632
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,008
THE THING IS,

1633
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:06,076
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE MOVE,

1634
01:04:06,110 --> 01:04:07,244
AND IT'S HARD.

1635
01:04:07,277 --> 01:04:09,546
BUT YOUR DAD
WILL BE OKAY.

1636
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:10,614
AND YOU WILL, TOO.

1637
01:04:10,647 --> 01:04:12,216
YOU HAVE EACH OTHER.

1638
01:04:12,249 --> 01:04:14,018
THANKS, GRACE.

1639
01:04:14,051 --> 01:04:17,221
COME ON,
LET'S GRAB SOME SUSHI.

1640
01:04:44,014 --> 01:04:45,115
REHEARSAL DINNER?

1641
01:04:45,149 --> 01:04:46,951
"OPEN HOUSE SUSHI."

1642
01:04:46,984 --> 01:04:48,919
YOU SEE ALL THOSE
PEOPLE OUT THERE?

1643
01:04:48,953 --> 01:04:50,054
TRYING NOT TO.

1644
01:04:50,087 --> 01:04:51,521
YEAH, ME TOO.

1645
01:04:53,557 --> 01:04:55,559
I REMEMBER
WHEN I BOUGHT THIS PLACE.

1646
01:04:55,592 --> 01:04:56,961
THERE WAS NO SUSHI,

1647
01:04:56,994 --> 01:05:00,364
JUST AN OLD HOUSE
AND A RUSTY DOCK.

1648
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:01,598
AND AN EVEN
RUSTIER DRUMMER

1649
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:03,500
WHO MADE GRILLED CHEESE
ON AN IRON.

1650
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:05,202
WHY'D YOU TAKE THAT
OFF THE MENU?

1651
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:06,303
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A HOUSE FAVORITE?

1652
01:05:06,336 --> 01:05:08,072
MORE LIKE A DUCK FAVORITE.

1653
01:05:13,377 --> 01:05:15,412
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?

1654
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:17,147
ABOUT WHAT?

1655
01:05:37,367 --> 01:05:40,204
SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
OUT ON THE BIKE TRAIL.

1656
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:45,009
NAH, IT'S ALL RIGHT,
IT'S MY FAULT.

1657
01:05:45,042 --> 01:05:48,012
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I GOT SO UPSET.

1658
01:05:48,045 --> 01:05:49,613
PEOPLE GET NERVOUS
AROUND WEDDINGS.

1659
01:05:49,646 --> 01:05:50,680
YEAH.

1660
01:05:50,714 --> 01:05:52,482
I SEE IT ALL THE TIME.

1661
01:05:57,354 --> 01:06:00,290
DID YOU REALLY
COME BACK FOR ME?

1662
01:06:02,392 --> 01:06:04,328
YEAH, I DID.

1663
01:06:04,361 --> 01:06:05,695
THERE HE IS...

1664
01:06:05,729 --> 01:06:07,364
POP STAR IN THE FLESH.

1665
01:06:07,397 --> 01:06:08,498
WHOA-HO, HUGE FAN!

1666
01:06:08,532 --> 01:06:10,567
CAN I GET
A SELFIE?

1667
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:11,535
SURE.

1668
01:06:13,203 --> 01:06:16,006
MY MOTHER
PLAYED YOU NON-STOP

1669
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,174
WHEN I WAS
GROWING UP.

1670
01:06:17,207 --> 01:06:18,142
YOUR MOM, HUH?

1671
01:06:18,175 --> 01:06:19,309
AND MY GRANDMOTHER.

1672
01:06:19,343 --> 01:06:21,045
OH, YES...

1673
01:06:21,078 --> 01:06:22,646
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN BIG
WITH THE GRANDMOTHERS.

1674
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:25,315
I CANNOT WAIT TO TELL THEM
WHOSE PROPERTY WE'RE BUYING.

1675
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:26,750
I THINK I JUST
HEARD AN OFFER.

1676
01:06:29,353 --> 01:06:30,320
COME ON,

1677
01:06:30,354 --> 01:06:32,622
LET'S SHOW THEM WHERE
WE'RE GONNA TIE THE KNOT.

1678
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:34,524
RIGHT UP HERE, GUYS.

1679
01:06:45,102 --> 01:06:46,136
SWEETIE?

1680
01:06:47,404 --> 01:06:50,240
WHAT'S THAT
YOU'RE READING THERE?

1681
01:06:50,274 --> 01:06:52,709
I WANTED TO DO
A TOAST AT THE WEDDING,

1682
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:56,246
AND I NEEDED
SOME INSPIRATION.

1683
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,182
BUT I'M NEVER GOING TO
BE ABLE TO WRITE

1684
01:06:58,215 --> 01:07:01,118
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

1685
01:07:05,789 --> 01:07:07,191
THEY REALLY
LOVED EACH OTHER,

1686
01:07:07,224 --> 01:07:08,458
DIDN'T THEY, GRANDMA?

1687
01:07:08,492 --> 01:07:10,360
OH, IT WAS
SO LONG AGO,

1688
01:07:10,394 --> 01:07:11,328
THEY WERE WET
BEHIND THE EARS,

1689
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:12,429
PUPPY LOVE.

1690
01:07:12,462 --> 01:07:15,399
IT WAS MORE THAN THAT.

1691
01:07:15,432 --> 01:07:16,566
MAYBE.

1692
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,534
DEFINITELY.

1693
01:07:20,637 --> 01:07:23,140
EVEN BEFORE MICK LEFT,
YOU DIDN'T LIKE HIM.

1694
01:07:23,173 --> 01:07:24,174
WHY?

1695
01:07:26,243 --> 01:07:28,378
AS A MOTHER, UM,

1696
01:07:28,412 --> 01:07:31,315
YOU WANT THE BEST FOR YOUR KIDS.

1697
01:07:31,348 --> 01:07:33,550
SO, IF YOU SEE HEARTACHE COMING,

1698
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:37,354
YOU DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN
TO JUMP IN AND DEFLECT IT.

1699
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:39,523
READING THESE,

1700
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:41,291
I'M GUESSING
SHE GOT HIT ANYWAY.

1701
01:07:41,325 --> 01:07:43,227
WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THE PAST

1702
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:44,361
IS PASSED,

1703
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:46,463
AND IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING'S
TURNED OUT ALL RIGHT.

1704
01:07:46,496 --> 01:07:48,565
I MEAN, SHE'S GOT JOSH NOW.

1705
01:07:48,598 --> 01:07:51,101
BUT WHAT IF HE'S NOT
THE RIGHT ONE?

1706
01:07:51,135 --> 01:07:52,202
AND WHAT IF HE IS?

1707
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:58,308
TELL YOU WHAT...

1708
01:08:00,344 --> 01:08:02,712
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
MAKE THE TOAST, HMM?

1709
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:05,549
IF YOU THINK OF SOMETHING,
YOU CAN ADD ON.

1710
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:08,852
IT'S JUST ONE LESS THING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

1711
01:08:20,864 --> 01:08:22,399
FOLKS...

1712
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:25,202
I'VE GOT A CHOIR GROUP
IN AN HOUR.

1713
01:08:25,235 --> 01:08:26,303
WHERE'S OUR GROOM?

1714
01:08:26,336 --> 01:08:27,804
HE'S...
HE'S ON A CALL.

1715
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:29,506
HE WON'T BE LONG.

1716
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:31,541
PERHAPS WE COULD USE
A STAND-IN UNTIL HE GETS HERE?

1717
01:08:31,575 --> 01:08:32,842
OH, YES,
JOHNNY WILL DO IT.

1718
01:08:32,876 --> 01:08:33,910
GO ON.

1719
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,212
I KINDA MADE A VOW

1720
01:08:35,245 --> 01:08:36,180
NEVER TO WALK DOWN
ANOTHER AISLE, SO...

1721
01:08:38,282 --> 01:08:40,384
AND I'M JUST HEARING
ABOUT THIS NOW?

1722
01:08:40,417 --> 01:08:42,886
MICK, YOU DO IT.

1723
01:08:42,919 --> 01:08:45,622
UNFORTUNATELY
I'M A LITTLE BUSY.

1724
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:48,392
DAD, GET UP THERE.

1725
01:08:48,425 --> 01:08:49,526
THE REVEREND HAS TO LEAVE.

1726
01:08:53,263 --> 01:08:54,664
COME ON.

1727
01:09:07,544 --> 01:09:09,379
AND... MUSIC.

1728
01:09:27,964 --> 01:09:30,467
WE ARE GATHERED TOGETHER
TO UNITE A COUPLE IN LOVE.

1729
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,901
OBVIOUSLY,
THE BRIDE AND GROOM

1730
01:09:31,935 --> 01:09:33,937
WILL BE STANDING
A LITTLE CLOSER.

1731
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:35,605
CLOSER.

1732
01:09:37,274 --> 01:09:38,875
CLOSER.

1733
01:09:42,812 --> 01:09:44,314
THAT'S GOOD,
THAT'S GOOD.

1734
01:09:44,348 --> 01:09:46,550
I BELIEVE
YOU'VE WRITTEN YOUR OWN VOWS.

1735
01:09:46,583 --> 01:09:48,852
UH, ACTUALLY, I HAVEN'T
QUITE FINISHED MINE.

1736
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:49,986
YOU REALLY HAVEN'T FINISHED?

1737
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,555
NO.

1738
01:09:51,588 --> 01:09:52,922
SORRY, IT'S JUST,

1739
01:09:52,956 --> 01:09:55,625
YOU USED TO WRITE
ENTIRE SONGS FASTER.

1740
01:09:55,659 --> 01:09:58,962
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
THOSE WORDS WERE MEANINGLESS.

1741
01:09:58,995 --> 01:10:00,897
OH, OUCH.

1742
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:01,865
DOES THE STAND-IN
HAVE TO TALK?

1743
01:10:01,898 --> 01:10:03,800
PERHAPS WE'RE GETTING
A LITTLE OFF TRACK.

1744
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:05,402
I BELIEVE WE HAVE A SONG?

1745
01:10:05,435 --> 01:10:06,403
YEAH, THAT'S ME AGAIN.

1746
01:10:06,436 --> 01:10:07,337
WE'LL SKIP OVER THAT.

1747
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:08,505
RINGS?

1748
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:10,240
THE GROOM
HAS THE RINGS.

1749
01:10:10,274 --> 01:10:11,641
AND THEN, OF COURSE,

1750
01:10:11,675 --> 01:10:13,443
DOES ANYONE OBJECT
TO THIS UNION...

1751
01:10:17,414 --> 01:10:18,982
JUST STRETCHING,
THAT'S ALL.

1752
01:10:19,015 --> 01:10:20,584
SIT DOWN.

1753
01:10:20,617 --> 01:10:21,685
MOVING ALONG,

1754
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:22,652
I'LL PRONOUNCE YOU
MAN AND WIFE,

1755
01:10:22,686 --> 01:10:24,354
AND YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDE.

1756
01:10:26,323 --> 01:10:27,591
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1757
01:10:27,624 --> 01:10:28,658
WELL, YOU DON'T
WANT TO ARGUE

1758
01:10:28,692 --> 01:10:30,727
WITH A MAN OF GOD, DO YOU?

1759
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:31,928
SORRY,
EVERYONE!

1760
01:10:36,666 --> 01:10:37,967
YOU MUST BE
THE GROOM.

1761
01:10:38,001 --> 01:10:39,336
I APOLOGIZE FOR
THE DELAY, REVEREND,

1762
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:40,704
BUT I HAVE
SOME GREAT NEWS.

1763
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:42,406
TWO OFFERS.
BOTH OVER ASK.

1764
01:10:42,439 --> 01:10:44,574
ALL CASH, 30-DAY ESCROW.

1765
01:10:44,608 --> 01:10:46,009
30 DAYS?

1766
01:10:46,042 --> 01:10:48,011
WELL, I COULD PUSH
FOR 15 DAYS IF YOU WANT.

1767
01:10:48,044 --> 01:10:51,848
NO, I WAS THINKING OF PUSHING
IN THE OTHER DIRECTION.

1768
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:53,317
IF YOU LET THEM
SLEEP ON IT,

1769
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:55,885
THEY MIGHT NOT SLEEP IN IT.

1770
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:56,886
AND WITH THE PROFIT
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE,

1771
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,922
I'M GOING TO FIND YOU
THE PLACE OF YOUR DREAMS.

1772
01:11:00,324 --> 01:11:02,559
BUT THIS WAS
THE PLACE OF MY DREAMS.

1773
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:04,761
THERE ARE ALWAYS
BIGGER DREAMS.

1774
01:11:04,794 --> 01:11:05,829
CONGRATULATIONS.

1775
01:11:08,465 --> 01:11:10,967
WELL, I GUESS CONGRATULATIONS
IS IN ORDER FOR BOTH OF US.

1776
01:11:18,074 --> 01:11:19,743
OKAY, YOU TWO.

1777
01:11:21,511 --> 01:11:22,512
MAYBE A BRIDE AND GROOM KISS?

1778
01:11:22,546 --> 01:11:23,547
OH, YES.

1779
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:24,514
SURE. GOOD IDEA.

1780
01:11:24,548 --> 01:11:25,582
GREAT.

1781
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:27,651
OH, HANG ON, MY PHONE.

1782
01:11:27,684 --> 01:11:29,953
SORRY, I FORGOT
TO SHUT OFF MY PHONE.

1783
01:11:29,986 --> 01:11:31,655
YEAH, I'LL TURN IT OFF.

1784
01:11:31,688 --> 01:11:32,689
GOOD, ALL RIGHT.

1785
01:11:32,722 --> 01:11:34,424
OKAY.

1786
01:11:38,828 --> 01:11:40,630
WOW, THAT'S WHAT I CALL
A REHEARSAL DINNER.

1787
01:11:40,664 --> 01:11:41,665
LET'S EAT!

1788
01:11:41,698 --> 01:11:43,400
OH, HEY, MICK.

1789
01:11:43,433 --> 01:11:44,868
I'LL HAVE THOSE PAPERS
DRAWN UP AFTER THE WEDDING.

1790
01:11:44,901 --> 01:11:47,471
YOU KNOW, I THINK
OUR BEING HERE WAS FATE.

1791
01:11:48,938 --> 01:11:49,973
MAYBE.

1792
01:11:50,006 --> 01:11:53,009
IT'S LOOKING LIKE OURS
WILL BE THE LAST WEDDING HERE.

1793
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:56,012
TO MARRIAGES AND MORTGAGES.

1794
01:11:56,045 --> 01:11:57,681
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE
PAYING FOR BOTH OF THEM

1795
01:11:57,714 --> 01:11:59,849
FOR THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE.

1796
01:12:02,752 --> 01:12:05,088
I'D LIKE TO MAKE A TOAST.

1797
01:12:05,121 --> 01:12:06,823
OLIVIA...

1798
01:12:06,856 --> 01:12:09,759
I KNOW I'VE BEEN
CRITICAL OF YOU.

1799
01:12:09,793 --> 01:12:12,396
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE
IN THIS ROOM.

1800
01:12:12,429 --> 01:12:14,431
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT
TOGETHER, SWEETHEART.

1801
01:12:14,464 --> 01:12:17,434
MOM, WHERE ARE YOU
GOING WITH THIS?

1802
01:12:17,467 --> 01:12:19,436
I'M APOLOGIZING.

1803
01:12:21,605 --> 01:12:22,606
I'VE BEEN MARRIED A FEW TIMES,

1804
01:12:22,639 --> 01:12:24,974
AS A LOT OF YOU KNOW,

1805
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:28,578
BUT THAT WAS BECAUSE
I DIDN'T WAIT FOR THE RIGHT ONE.

1806
01:12:28,612 --> 01:12:31,047
YOU ARE A WONDERFUL,
BEAUTIFUL,

1807
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,416
SMART WOMAN,
OLIVIA,

1808
01:12:32,449 --> 01:12:35,452
AND I'M
SO PROUD OF YOU.

1809
01:12:35,485 --> 01:12:39,423
AND IN THE END,
YOU ALWAYS DO THE RIGHT THING.

1810
01:12:40,824 --> 01:12:41,791
HEAR, HEAR.

1811
01:12:41,825 --> 01:12:43,693
TO OLIVIA.

1812
01:12:43,727 --> 01:12:44,894
TO OLIVIA.

1813
01:12:44,928 --> 01:12:46,463
THANK YOU, MOM.

1814
01:12:52,569 --> 01:12:55,739
I KNOW YOU GUYS WANTED
TO DO THIS AT THE COURTHOUSE,

1815
01:12:55,772 --> 01:12:57,507
BUT I'M REALLY HAPPY

1816
01:12:57,541 --> 01:12:58,875
THAT WE'RE ALL
HERE TOGETHER

1817
01:12:58,908 --> 01:13:00,744
IN THIS AMAZING PLACE,

1818
01:13:00,777 --> 01:13:02,446
EVEN IF YOU DID MANAGE

1819
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:04,548
TO SQUEEZE IN AN OPEN HOUSE.

1820
01:13:05,982 --> 01:13:07,183
MOM, YOU
ALWAYS TOLD ME

1821
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,753
TO FOLLOW MY HEART.

1822
01:13:11,521 --> 01:13:12,989
TO FOLLOWING YOURS.

1823
01:13:14,558 --> 01:13:15,992
THANK YOU, HONEY.

1824
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:19,463
I KNOW

1825
01:13:19,496 --> 01:13:20,964
I'M NOT PART OF THE FAMILY,

1826
01:13:20,997 --> 01:13:23,600
BUT I FEEL LIKE
I AM TONIGHT.

1827
01:13:23,633 --> 01:13:25,802
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF
WEDDINGS HERE,

1828
01:13:25,835 --> 01:13:28,638
BUT THIS ONE IS SPECIAL
FOR A LOT OF REASONS.

1829
01:13:28,672 --> 01:13:31,441
I WISH YOU BOTH THE VERY BEST.

1830
01:13:31,475 --> 01:13:33,543
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1831
01:13:33,577 --> 01:13:34,944
THANK YOU.

1832
01:13:37,614 --> 01:13:39,182
DAD, YOU SHOULD
MAKE A TOAST.

1833
01:13:39,215 --> 01:13:40,717
ME? NO!

1834
01:13:42,686 --> 01:13:44,588
DAD...

1835
01:13:44,621 --> 01:13:45,989
MICK, PLEASE.

1836
01:13:46,022 --> 01:13:48,492
IT WOULD MEAN A LOT
TO ALL OF US.

1837
01:13:52,061 --> 01:13:54,464
UM...

1838
01:13:56,199 --> 01:13:57,801
WELL, AS PART OF OLIVIA'S PAST,

1839
01:13:57,834 --> 01:13:58,935
IT'S...

1840
01:13:58,968 --> 01:14:01,538
IT'S AN HONOR
TO MEET HER FUTURE.

1841
01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:04,207
JOSH, YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN.

1842
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:09,445
WHEN I THINK OF
THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER...

1843
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:14,718
...I FEEL SICK.

1844
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:17,821
BECAUSE YOU NEVER THINK,

1845
01:14:17,854 --> 01:14:18,788
AT 19,

1846
01:14:18,822 --> 01:14:20,223
YOU'RE GOING TO MEET
THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE.

1847
01:14:20,256 --> 01:14:21,725
I SHOULD HAVE
FOUGHT FOR YOU THEN, LIVVY,

1848
01:14:21,758 --> 01:14:23,059
BUT I MESSED UP,

1849
01:14:23,092 --> 01:14:25,061
AND I CAN'T STAND TO WATCH YOU
SLIP AWAY AGAIN.

1850
01:14:25,094 --> 01:14:26,963
WE BELONG TOGETHER.
DON'T MARRY HIM!

1851
01:14:26,996 --> 01:14:27,931
THAT'S ENOUGH.

1852
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:29,032
I'M SORRY.

1853
01:14:29,065 --> 01:14:30,567
BUT I LOVE HER.
I ALWAYS HAVE--

1854
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:31,701
JOSH!

1855
01:14:39,943 --> 01:14:41,177
IT'S ALL RIGHT, HONEY.

1856
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:43,246
HE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE
HIT ME HARDER.

1857
01:14:44,848 --> 01:14:46,916
I WAS WRONG
ABOUT YOU, MICK.

1858
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:49,686
I'M SO SORRY.

1859
01:15:01,097 --> 01:15:02,866
HERE YOU GO, SWEETHEART.

1860
01:15:02,899 --> 01:15:05,034
THANKS.

1861
01:15:08,605 --> 01:15:11,741
I JUST CAME
TO SAY GOODBYE.

1862
01:15:11,775 --> 01:15:12,776
HOW'S YOUR DAD?

1863
01:15:12,809 --> 01:15:13,943
HE'LL BOUNCE BACK.

1864
01:15:13,977 --> 01:15:15,144
ALWAYS DOES.

1865
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:16,913
I'M SURE THE DUCKS
WILL HELP HIM THROUGH IT.

1866
01:15:16,946 --> 01:15:18,214
HOW'S YOUR MOM?

1867
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:19,949
SHE'LL SURVIVE.

1868
01:15:19,983 --> 01:15:22,051
WE'RE JUST HEADING OUT,

1869
01:15:22,085 --> 01:15:23,787
I'M GUESSING A WEDDING
WOULD BE A HARD SELL

1870
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:24,954
AT THIS POINT.

1871
01:15:24,988 --> 01:15:26,556
I'D IT'S ON HOLD AT LEAST.

1872
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:29,192
MOST LIKELY A VENUE CHANGE
IF ANYTHING.

1873
01:15:29,225 --> 01:15:30,627
UNDERSTANDABLE.

1874
01:15:33,196 --> 01:15:34,598
I WISH THINGS
ENDED DIFFERENTLY.

1875
01:15:34,631 --> 01:15:35,732
ME TOO.

1876
01:15:35,765 --> 01:15:37,567
GROUP HUG.

1877
01:15:38,835 --> 01:15:40,203
YOU HAVE MY EMAIL
AND MY NUMBER.

1878
01:15:40,236 --> 01:15:41,270
FRIEND ME.

1879
01:16:34,157 --> 01:16:36,826
I'M SO SORRY, MOM.

1880
01:16:41,898 --> 01:16:43,399
I JUST WANTED THINGS
TO BE ROMANTIC FOR YOU.

1881
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:45,334
I KNOW, HONEY.

1882
01:16:45,368 --> 01:16:46,836
IT'S OKAY.

1883
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:49,105
IT WAS AWFUL.

1884
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:57,113
YOU KNOW, HONEY...

1885
01:16:57,146 --> 01:16:58,014
IT WASN'T.

1886
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:04,287
I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT
THE PAST FEW DAYS,

1887
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:09,025
AND, YOU KNOW, I'VE REALIZED
THAT I'VE BEEN STAGING MY LIFE,

1888
01:17:09,058 --> 01:17:10,827
AND NOT LIVING IT.

1889
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:13,096
AND I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO STAGE YOURS, TOO.

1890
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:15,999
YOU DON'T NEED
TO BE THE NEW ME.

1891
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,837
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I WANT TO BE THAT PERSON.

1892
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:23,206
GO FIND YOURSELF,
SWEETHEART.

1893
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:25,675
WHO KNOWS, MAYBE YOU'LL EVEN
WANT TO BE A WEDDING PLANNER.

1894
01:17:25,709 --> 01:17:27,110
AFTER THIS WEEKEND?

1895
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:28,277
I DOUBT IT.

1896
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:30,847
COME HERE.

1897
01:17:32,882 --> 01:17:33,950
I LOVE YOU.

1898
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:36,652
I LOVE YOU.

1899
01:17:38,287 --> 01:17:40,323
WELL...

1900
01:17:40,356 --> 01:17:43,960
IT'S STILL OFFICIALLY
MY WEDDING DAY, AND...

1901
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:46,295
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO.

1902
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,165
DINNER AND A SAPPY MOVIE?

1903
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:52,035
I WOULD LOVE TO.

1904
01:18:01,377 --> 01:18:03,012
IT'S JOSH.

1905
01:18:07,884 --> 01:18:08,885
HEY.

1906
01:18:08,918 --> 01:18:10,419
LEMON CAKE?

1907
01:18:10,453 --> 01:18:12,288
WHY NOT?

1908
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:15,258
YOU OKAY?

1909
01:18:15,291 --> 01:18:17,260
I'M HANGING IN THERE.

1910
01:18:17,293 --> 01:18:19,095
I'M PROUD OF YOU, DAD.

1911
01:18:19,128 --> 01:18:21,497
I RUINED A WEDDING,
AND I LOST THE GIRL.

1912
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:22,966
YOU TOOK A RISK.

1913
01:18:22,999 --> 01:18:24,801
AND FAILED EPICALLY.

1914
01:18:24,834 --> 01:18:27,370
NOT IN MY EYES.

1915
01:18:29,472 --> 01:18:32,241
YOU KNOW, MY COLLEGE
ISN'T THAT FAR AWAY.

1916
01:18:32,275 --> 01:18:33,943
YOU CAN VISIT ME ANYTIME.

1917
01:18:33,977 --> 01:18:36,145
AND YOU CAN
VISIT HOME ANYTIME.

1918
01:18:36,179 --> 01:18:38,748
THANKSGIVING
AT YOUR NEW PLACE?

1919
01:18:38,782 --> 01:18:41,084
THANKSGIVING HERE.

1920
01:18:41,117 --> 01:18:42,385
I'M NOT SELLING.

1921
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:44,653
REALLY?

1922
01:18:44,687 --> 01:18:48,091
WHERE AM I GOING TO FIND
A PLACE ANY BETTER THAN THIS?

1923
01:18:48,124 --> 01:18:50,326
I LOVE YOU.

1924
01:18:52,195 --> 01:18:53,797
YOU'RE THE WORLD'S
GREATEST DAD.

1925
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:56,465
AND I'VE GOT A TROPHY
TO PROVE IT.

1926
01:19:23,893 --> 01:19:25,194
ARE YOU OKAY?

1927
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:29,332
I'VE BEEN BETTER.

1928
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,269
I'M REALLY SORRY.

1929
01:19:33,302 --> 01:19:34,337
I GUESS IT'S SAFE TO SAY

1930
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:36,139
THAT WE'RE NOT GOING
TO THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE

1931
01:19:36,172 --> 01:19:37,406
ANYTIME SOON.

1932
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,043
PROBABLY NOT.

1933
01:19:40,076 --> 01:19:41,911
UNLESS YOU HAVE A LISTING
NEAR THE COURTHOUSE?

1934
01:19:41,945 --> 01:19:43,146
IS THERE ONE?

1935
01:19:47,851 --> 01:19:49,585
WE ARE GOOD TOGETHER, OLIVIA.

1936
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:51,888
WE ARE.

1937
01:19:51,921 --> 01:19:53,222
AT WORK.

1938
01:19:53,256 --> 01:19:55,158
I THOUGHT THAT WAS ENOUGH.

1939
01:19:55,191 --> 01:19:58,427
SO DID I.

1940
01:19:58,461 --> 01:20:00,063
BUT IT'S NOT,

1941
01:20:00,096 --> 01:20:01,931
FOR EITHER OF US.

1942
01:20:03,066 --> 01:20:04,400
HEY, YOU TWO.

1943
01:20:04,433 --> 01:20:05,568
SO...

1944
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:07,570
I GUESS CONGRATULATIONS
ARE IN ORDER?

1945
01:20:07,603 --> 01:20:09,238
NO, THAT...

1946
01:20:09,272 --> 01:20:10,606
RECENTLY
FELL OUT OF ESCROW.

1947
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,441
OH, I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

1948
01:20:12,475 --> 01:20:14,510
IT'S ALL GOOD.

1949
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:16,545
WELL, THE REASON
I CALLED YOU BOTH

1950
01:20:16,579 --> 01:20:19,215
IS THAT I'VE DECIDED
TO LIST AFTER ALL.

1951
01:20:19,248 --> 01:20:21,350
REALLY?

1952
01:20:21,384 --> 01:20:23,052
I MEAN, THE PLACE IS AMAZING,

1953
01:20:23,086 --> 01:20:24,353
AND OLIVIA,
IT'S NEVER LOOKED BETTER,

1954
01:20:24,387 --> 01:20:25,855
BUT...

1955
01:20:25,889 --> 01:20:27,924
IT JUST DOESN'T
FEEL LIKE ME ANYMORE.

1956
01:20:29,058 --> 01:20:30,426
I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

1957
01:20:30,459 --> 01:20:32,395
BRUCE, I HAVE
A GREAT LISTING

1958
01:20:32,428 --> 01:20:33,529
THAT JUST CAME ON THE MARKET.

1959
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:35,364
KILLER VIEWS,
3,200 SQUARE FEET.

1960
01:20:35,398 --> 01:20:36,465
WHEN YOU SEE IT,

1961
01:20:36,499 --> 01:20:39,903
YOU'RE GONNA FORGET
THAT YOU LIVED ANYWHERE ELSE.

1962
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:43,940
AND HE'S BACK.

1963
01:20:45,608 --> 01:20:46,509
...IT'S GONNA BE FANTASTIC.

1964
01:20:46,542 --> 01:20:47,510
HEY!

1965
01:20:47,543 --> 01:20:49,212
DRINK UP.

1966
01:20:49,245 --> 01:20:50,947
WE GOT A GIG.

1967
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:53,082
DON'T TELL ME YOU BOOKED
ANOTHER WEDDING?

1968
01:20:53,116 --> 01:20:54,183
NO, A CLUB.

1969
01:20:54,217 --> 01:20:55,218
TWO NIGHTS.

1970
01:20:55,251 --> 01:20:56,986
AND BEFORE YOU SAY NO,
THINK OF ALL THE PERKS.

1971

01:21:23,312 --> 01:21:25,348
AND BY THE WAY,
WE'RE NOT GOING TO DINNER,

1982
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:26,449
OR A MOVIE.

1983
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:28,684
WE'RE NOT?

1984
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:30,486

01:21:44,033 --> 01:21:45,068
OLIVIA, YOU LOOK...

1988
01:21:45,101 --> 01:21:46,402
LIKE HER OLD SELF.

1989
01:21:46,435 --> 01:21:48,404
"OLD?"

1990
01:21:48,437 --> 01:21:49,672
