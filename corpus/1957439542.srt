00:00:17,862 --> 00:00:21,068
This is the story
about how once upon a time,

2
00:00:21,103 --> 00:00:22,827
my daddy became Santa.

3
00:00:22,862 --> 00:00:24,586
And not just any Santa,

4
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,517
the greatest Santa of all time.

5
00:00:27,551 --> 00:00:29,655
Go, Daddy! Go, go!

6
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:31,286
Are you ready for the
traffic light challenge?

7
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,079
Are you ready for
the traffic light challenge?

8
00:00:33,103 --> 00:00:34,172
Yeah.

That was fun, Daddy.
It's gon' go viral for sure!

18
00:01:08,206 --> 00:01:10,586
See, I told you I could
get you beaucoup followers.

19
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,586
You know I'm the
original social media.

20
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,689
When I throw a party,

21
00:01:13,724 --> 00:01:15,482
they got to call
the National Guard

22
00:01:15,517 --> 00:01:18,551
to get all the people
out of my place.

23
00:01:18,586 --> 00:01:20,172
Million dollar business idea,

24
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:22,551
make a repellent that
clears the club hella fast

25
00:01:22,586 --> 00:01:23,689
when the party's over.

26
00:01:23,724 --> 00:01:25,827
Perfect Christmas gift, Daddy!

27
00:01:25,862 --> 00:01:28,448
Eh, you know, Christmas
is the biggest con of all.

28
00:01:28,482 --> 00:01:30,413
Why you always say that?

29
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:32,655
That's gonna land you
on the naughty list.

30
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:35,413
Ah, you always gonna be
on Santa's nice list.

31
00:01:35,448 --> 00:01:37,241
My little miracle baby.

32
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:39,206
No, don't tell the story again.

33
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:43,689
Yep, doctors always told us
we couldn't have any kids.

34
00:01:43,724 --> 00:01:46,620
But after many years of
marriage, out of the blue,

35
00:01:46,655 --> 00:01:48,172
we got pregnant.

36
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:52,517
We named you Nevaeh,
Heaven spelled backwards.

37
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:54,793
So where are we going today?

38
00:01:54,827 --> 00:01:56,517
Uh, Horseyland.

39
00:01:56,551 --> 00:01:58,482
You mean the race track.

40
00:01:58,517 --> 00:01:59,862
We going to House of Games.

41
00:01:59,896 --> 00:02:01,620
You mean the casino?

42
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:03,379
Um, Pockets of Fun.

43
00:02:03,413 --> 00:02:04,724
You mean pool hall.

44
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:07,586
And I also know the
ballet's the strip club.

45
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,310
How did you know that?

46
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:10,758
I never took you there.

47
00:02:10,793 --> 00:02:13,379
I've heard you talk about
it with your friends.

48
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:16,344
We can go anywhere you wanna go.

49
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:21,413
Yeah, this is Nicky.

50
00:02:21,448 --> 00:02:24,482
No, I can't do that
today, I'm busy.

51
00:02:24,517 --> 00:02:25,896
No, man, I'm b...

52
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:31,206
Fine, just text it to me.

53
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:32,896
Yeah, text it to me.

54
00:02:33,724 --> 00:02:36,551
Dog!

55
00:02:36,586 --> 00:02:39,379
I gotta, gotta make
a stop for my job.

56
00:02:39,413 --> 00:02:44,275
After we're done doing that,
the whole day is yours.

57
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,448
You know the drill.

58
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:47,275
Lock the doors.

59
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,379
If anybody approaches
the car, blow the horn,

60
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:50,551
and I'll come running.

61
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:51,931
If it's an emergency...

62
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:54,241
Pepper spray in your
glove compartment.

63
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:55,620
And most importantly,

64
00:02:55,655 --> 00:02:58,206
Don't tell Mommy!

65
00:03:00,482 --> 00:03:02,931
Daddy, explain your job again?

66
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:05,827
Well, I guess you
can say at my job,

67
00:03:05,862 --> 00:03:08,724
I'm the best BS detector out.

68
00:03:08,758 --> 00:03:12,482
Not any con that I can't catch.

69
00:03:12,517 --> 00:03:15,448
Remember that when you
get to become a teenager.

70
00:03:27,827 --> 00:03:29,620
Know the rules, lock the door.

71
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm looking for a Deshaun.

72
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:52,275
I'm his brother.

73
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,965
So let me guess,

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,448
he owes your boss a loan
or something like that,

75
00:03:56,482 --> 00:03:58,448
and you're here
to collect, right?

76
00:03:58,482 --> 00:04:02,379
But the thing is,
our bro, he's not paying.

77
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:04,379
Ever.

78
00:04:04,413 --> 00:04:05,620
Now you come around here again

79
00:04:05,655 --> 00:04:07,344
and I'm gonna lock your ass up.

80
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:08,689
Shut up!

81
00:04:08,724 --> 00:04:10,517
First of all,
your uniform is bogus.

82
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:11,689
And what is this?

83
00:04:11,724 --> 00:04:13,034
Your badge is out of date

84
00:04:13,068 --> 00:04:15,344
and your gun is not
even holstered properly.

85
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:17,068
Pay me my money, Deshaun!

86
00:04:17,103 --> 00:04:18,758
Give me my money now!

87
00:04:18,793 --> 00:04:20,586
Okay, all right.

88
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:24,344
What the hell you think this is?

89
00:04:36,413 --> 00:04:37,931
Get up, Ryker!

90
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,758
Come on, man.

91
00:04:40,793 --> 00:04:42,827
You can't blame a guy
for trying, right?

92
00:04:42,862 --> 00:04:45,517
I heard you might
stop by, Nicky.

93
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:46,862
Look man, your debt is high,

94
00:04:46,896 --> 00:04:48,448
and you're still gambling, bro?

95
00:04:48,482 --> 00:04:50,034
You're one to talk!

96
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:51,976
You're shackled to the
mob for the money you owe!

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,896
Okay, at least I'm
chipping away at mine.

98
00:04:53,931 --> 00:04:55,724
Come on, man!

99
00:04:55,758 --> 00:04:57,896
Irish Mike brags on you!

100
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,758
He says you see
things others can't.

101
00:05:00,793 --> 00:05:03,413
Well, tell me, did
you see this coming?

102
00:05:03,448 --> 00:05:04,620
Daddy!

103
00:05:04,655 --> 00:05:06,655
Hey!

104
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:08,148
Officer Rogers with Child
Protective Services.

105
00:05:08,172 --> 00:05:10,655
We've received reports of
your suspicious activity

106
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:14,034
and we've been gathering proof
of child abandonment, neglect.

107
00:05:14,068 --> 00:05:15,758
Neglect? I'm right here.

108
00:05:15,793 --> 00:05:18,482
Collecting gambling debts
and illegal activity

109
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:21,379
while your child is
under your supervision.

110
00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:25,379
Not to mention the open liquor
bottles we now see in your car.

111
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:26,596
We have to take custody
of your daughter,

112
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,034
return her to her mom.

113
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:29,586
Please don't do this.

114
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,941
You'll appear before
a judge this week

115
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:33,034
where your case will be heard.

116
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:35,137
Please, ma'am, he
said he was sorry!

117
00:05:35,172 --> 00:05:38,586
Can't you just give
him a break, please?

118
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,000
We are.

119
00:05:40,034 --> 00:05:41,803
We could detain him for
illegal debt collection,

120
00:05:41,827 --> 00:05:45,551
but that's another
department's job.

121
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:48,758
Listen, baby. Daddy did
something really bad this time.

122
00:05:48,793 --> 00:05:51,000
So you have to go
with the lady here.

123
00:05:51,034 --> 00:05:53,000
She'll be safe.

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,862
Don't worry, Daddy!
It's almost Christmas.

125
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,586

It's like the rapture in here.

133

Yeah.

you work for me

What do you want to know?

143
00:07:11,655 --> 00:07:13,241
You got an old lady?

144
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:15,034
Kids?

145
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:17,965
No and no.

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,896
Family.

147
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:21,517
Man, there's nothing
like it, you know?

148
00:07:21,551 --> 00:07:25,103
Yeah, I know.
I mean, I can only imagine.

149
00:07:25,137 --> 00:07:26,827
Can you imagine
that my business,

150
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:28,689
it's like an extended family?

151
00:07:28,724 --> 00:07:30,241
You included.

152
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:33,586
Now I don't want to hurt
my family, but I will.

153
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,517
Debt's gotta be paid.

154
00:07:35,551 --> 00:07:38,206
Ow!

155
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:40,758
Patty cake, patty
cake, baker's man.

156
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:45,620
I'll whoop your ass
as fast as I can!

157
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:52,206
Knock it off!

158
00:07:52,241 --> 00:07:55,034
Nicky, did you make
the racetrack pickup?

159
00:07:55,068 --> 00:07:57,034
No, I'll get it by 5 tomorrow.

160
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:05,206
Mike, remember the Timeless idea
I told you about? The business?

161
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:07,275
How could he forget?

162
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,827
You always yammering on
about that stupid night club.

163
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:13,034
It's an entertainment
experience.

164
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:15,965
Okay, what is something
that money can't buy?

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,931
Everybody wants and
we never get back?

166
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:22,275
- Time.
- Time.

167
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,965
So, imagine a place
where for a few hours,

168
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,965
time stands still.

169
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,965
Where the present meets the past

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,034
and we celebrate life
at it's highest level.

171
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:35,758
So you,

172
00:08:35,793 --> 00:08:37,148
you smell the roses while you
still got the chance, huh?

173
00:08:37,172 --> 00:08:39,586
- Exactly.
- Let's have a party, yeah.

174
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,137
And you said when I was ready,
you'd loan me the money.

175
00:08:43,172 --> 00:08:45,724
So I, I have the business
plan, I have location,

176
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,689
all I need is the $100,000.

177
00:08:47,724 --> 00:08:49,068
Oh, Nicky!

178
00:08:49,103 --> 00:08:50,620
I like you!

179
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,310
You're my best collector,

180
00:08:52,344 --> 00:08:54,310
but you don't exactly
inspire a lot of confidence.

181
00:08:54,344 --> 00:08:58,206
So, uh, sorry. No.

182
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:12,034
- Hey, baby!
- Hi!

183
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:13,182
Nicky, you're late as usual.

184
00:09:13,206 --> 00:09:15,862
No, we're not due
in court 'til 10.

185
00:09:15,896 --> 00:09:17,655
Nine o'clock. We called you,

186
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:19,758
and your cell went
straight to voicemail.

187
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,379
Forgot to put it on the
charger, it went dead.

188
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:25,862
Sweetheart, Daddy and
Mommy need to have a talk.

189
00:09:25,896 --> 00:09:27,344
I feel for you, Daddy!

190
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:29,689
When Mommy's neck starts
rolling and eyes start blinking,

191
00:09:29,724 --> 00:09:32,000
stop, drop, tuck, and roll!

192
00:09:32,034 --> 00:09:34,344
It's your only escape.

193
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:36,689
Little girl, this is
grown folk's business.

194
00:09:36,724 --> 00:09:40,103
Go over there and have a seat.

195
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:42,344
I left work in Connecticut
to come over here

196
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:45,862
during our busiest season
to deal with this mess.

197
00:09:45,896 --> 00:09:47,724
Liz, I was set up.

198
00:09:47,758 --> 00:09:50,172
Par for the course and
your so-called job.

199
00:09:50,206 --> 00:09:52,689
Courts have already ruled.

200
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:55,172
Look, it's a restraining order,

201
00:09:55,206 --> 00:09:58,172
barring you from seeing
Nevaeh if I sign.

202
00:09:58,206 --> 00:09:59,217
Ain't no piece of
paper 'bout to keep me

203
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:01,724
from seeing my kid.

204
00:10:01,758 --> 00:10:04,965
If you fight it, they could
bring charges up against you,

205
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,655
which could lead to jail time.

206
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:11,689
- They reviewing this in 90 days.
- 90 days?

207
00:10:11,724 --> 00:10:13,344
What about Christmas?

208
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,413
Liz, you not gon'
sign this, are you?

209
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:20,034
Under normal
circumstances, I wouldn't.

210
00:10:20,068 --> 00:10:22,413
But, Nicky, your behavior.

211
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:25,241
You gambling and
smoking and drinking.

212
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:26,689
Your job.

213
00:10:28,724 --> 00:10:30,172
It's too much.

214
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:32,241
I, I, I just need a few
days to wrap my mind

215
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:34,068
around this, okay?

216
00:10:34,103 --> 00:10:35,137
Come on, Nevaeh.

217
00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:38,689
Sorry.

218
00:10:48,068 --> 00:10:50,793
Million dollar business idea,

219
00:10:50,827 --> 00:10:52,689
find the cure for sadness,

220
00:10:52,724 --> 00:10:55,689
package it, and sell
the hell out of it.

221
00:10:55,724 --> 00:10:57,172
So call Irish Mike, all right?

222
00:10:57,206 --> 00:11:00,103
Get you a fake union job,
court'll think it's real.

223
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:02,000
No, I don't want Irish
Mike and his goons

224
00:11:02,034 --> 00:11:04,310
to know nothing
about Liz and Nevaeh.

225
00:11:04,344 --> 00:11:06,310
Oh, before I forget.

226
00:11:06,344 --> 00:11:09,758
Here's Irish Mike's
drop, 48,000.

227
00:11:11,241 --> 00:11:12,689
To Irish Mike,

228
00:11:13,896 --> 00:11:16,310
it's 50,000 a week here.

229
00:11:16,344 --> 00:11:18,931
He can't loan me 100,000?

230
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:24,137
I gotta admit,
I admire his hustle.

231
00:11:24,172 --> 00:11:27,379
He had the guts to
go get what he want.

232
00:11:27,413 --> 00:11:30,482
That's what I'm
gonna start doing.

233
00:11:30,517 --> 00:11:33,931
Listen, how much money you got?

234
00:11:34,448 --> 00:11:36,034
Four yards.

235
00:11:36,068 --> 00:11:37,758
I won a little bet earlier.

236
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:38,931
Give it, give it here.

237
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,448
Give it, give it, come on!

238
00:11:41,482 --> 00:11:44,068
Call your guy down
at the racetrack,

239
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,310
let him know it's an emergency.

240
00:11:46,344 --> 00:11:49,793
Tell him I need a,
I need a long shot.

241
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:55,413
Let him know it's gonna
be 10% for the win.

242
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,724
Willie, it's Joe.

243
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:01,482
Hey, I need a winner and
it's gotta be a lock.

244
00:12:01,517 --> 00:12:04,482
10%, and I'll forget
what you owe me.

245
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:05,965
And it needs to be in...

246
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,379
White Lightning.

247
00:12:07,413 --> 00:12:09,034
It's gotta be a lock!

248
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:10,379
Life and death!

249
00:12:12,034 --> 00:12:14,034
There you go.

250
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:19,000
Joey, if we gonna do this,
it's gonna need to be big!

251
00:12:19,034 --> 00:12:21,068
If, if, if I'm
gonna pay back Mike,

252
00:12:21,103 --> 00:12:25,034
open up my club Timeless, and
be with Nevaeh for Christmas,

253
00:12:25,068 --> 00:12:26,896
this has gotta be huge.

254
00:12:26,931 --> 00:12:29,448
If you're thinking what
I think you're thinking,

255
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,000
stop thinking!

256
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:32,275
No guts,

257
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,206
no glory!

258
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:35,034
Believe me when I tell you, man,

259
00:12:35,068 --> 00:12:38,034
gambling with mob
money is certifiable!

260
00:12:38,068 --> 00:12:40,448
I can't be without my Nevaeh.

261
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:42,137
I can't do that.

262
00:12:42,172 --> 00:12:45,793
It's like living without water.

263
00:12:45,827 --> 00:12:50,517
And I'm more afraid of that
then Irish Mike any day.

264
00:12:51,862 --> 00:12:54,551
Gimme another one.

265
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,206
Need it...

266
00:13:05,413 --> 00:13:07,896
on White Lightning.

267
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:11,034
Is there a problem?

268
00:13:15,482 --> 00:13:17,551
White Lightning!

269
00:13:30,448 --> 00:13:33,379
Yes, come on, White lady!
Come on, baby!

270
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:34,562
No, no, come on,
come on, come on!

271
00:13:34,586 --> 00:13:37,241
No, come on, come
on, come on, come on!

272
00:13:45,931 --> 00:13:47,103
Oh...

273
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:52,206
Oh God, no. Oh.

274
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:55,586
Okay, okay, look, no, no.

275
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,034
This, this, this is
not a death sentence.

276
00:13:58,068 --> 00:14:00,275
This is $48,000, okay?

277
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,310
- They're gonna kill you.
- No, no, no.

278
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:04,172
Nicky, Nicky, you gotta go, man!

279
00:14:04,206 --> 00:14:06,137
- No.
- Mexico, Canada.

280
00:14:06,172 --> 00:14:07,217
You gotta go, man.
You gotta, gotta go.

281
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:08,620
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

282
00:14:08,655 --> 00:14:09,976
I'm, I'm his best
collector, I'm good.

283
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,044
H-h-he's not gonna kill me.

284
00:14:11,068 --> 00:14:12,586
No, I'm good, I'm good.

285
00:14:15,172 --> 00:14:18,000
That won't work.
Mr. Malone, Mike, Mike.

286
00:14:18,034 --> 00:14:20,689
I was drunk and I'll do
whatever I need to do

287
00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:22,620
to make it up to you.

288
00:14:26,034 --> 00:14:27,448
- And then Anthony.
- Yeah.

289
00:14:27,482 --> 00:14:28,172
He hits the number for 10 grand,

290
00:14:28,206 --> 00:14:30,310
blows it all on a strip club.

291
00:14:30,344 --> 00:14:31,655
Ours I hope, right?

292
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:33,034
Of course, of course!

293
00:14:33,068 --> 00:14:35,000
It's ridiculous!

294
00:14:35,034 --> 00:14:37,103
You know, 'bout Nicky.

295
00:14:37,137 --> 00:14:38,655
What's going on?

296
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:40,458
Eh, Bernice from the casino
said he bet a mountain

297
00:14:40,482 --> 00:14:42,172
of cash.

298
00:14:42,206 --> 00:14:43,458
Didn't click who
he was until later.

299
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,344
Gambling with our money?

300
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:46,631
- I know.
- I mean that's beyond stupid.

301
00:14:46,655 --> 00:14:49,172
Yup.

302
00:14:49,206 --> 00:14:50,344
Ah, I like Nicky.

303
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:52,482
If he pays us back, he can live.

304
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:56,379
Look, he's not
gonna pay you back.

305
00:14:56,413 --> 00:14:59,137
The guy drives a
old raggedy LeBaron.

306
00:14:59,172 --> 00:15:00,551
If you go easy on him,

307
00:15:00,586 --> 00:15:02,172
people gonna think
you're going soft.

308
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:04,758
Eh, you're right.

309
00:15:04,793 --> 00:15:06,448
- I'm too nice.
- Yeah.

310
00:15:06,482 --> 00:15:08,448
- That's, that's my problem.
- You want me to...

311
00:15:08,482 --> 00:15:10,137
Nah, just, uh, take
him outta commission.

312
00:15:10,172 --> 00:15:11,689
Mm, all right.

313
00:15:11,724 --> 00:15:13,586
So, Andy's working out okay?

314
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,172
Yeah.

315
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,275
If he could stop being
stupid and try to show off.

316
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:21,206
Well, let's go Canada!

317
00:15:21,241 --> 00:15:23,517
Canada, here I come.

318
00:15:23,551 --> 00:15:26,034
LeBaron, it's me and
you all the way, baby.

319
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,758
Come on, no, no no.

320
00:15:31,793 --> 00:15:33,206
No, no, no!

321
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:34,344
Come on, no!

322
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:37,034
Don't do this to me now! No!

323
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:41,551
No!

324
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:11,655
God, I can't afford a
bus ticket to Canada.

325
00:16:13,448 --> 00:16:15,413
Where can I afford
a bus ticket to?

326
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,689
Hi!

327
00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:53,655
Hi, Daddy!

328
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:54,827
Daddy needs your help.

329
00:16:54,862 --> 00:16:57,241
I'm playing hide and seek
from some New York guys, okay?

330
00:16:57,275 --> 00:16:59,413
I love hide and seek, fun!

331
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:02,724
All right!

332
00:17:02,758 --> 00:17:05,206
This is your place
to stay for now!

333
00:17:07,413 --> 00:17:10,517
Hide here.
Mommy never comes here.

334
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:12,137
Okay.

335
00:17:12,172 --> 00:17:13,655
I gotta get ready for school.

336
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:15,275
See you later.

337
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,344
All right.

338
00:17:17,379 --> 00:17:19,137
- Love you, thank you.
- Love you, too.

339
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:22,586
Bye!

340
00:17:24,931 --> 00:17:27,620
- All right.
- Let's go.

341
00:17:27,655 --> 00:17:29,344
- So.
- Let's go!

342
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:31,148
You have a good day.
You gonna close the door?

343
00:17:31,172 --> 00:17:32,655
- Yeah.
- All right.

344
00:17:32,689 --> 00:17:35,758
Be careful!

345
00:17:43,517 --> 00:17:45,068
Bye.

346
00:17:53,241 --> 00:17:54,517
What?

347
00:17:59,931 --> 00:18:01,896
I see you, Liz.

348
00:18:01,931 --> 00:18:07,310
Stanford done turned Liz into
one of the Stepford ex-wives.

349
00:18:07,344 --> 00:18:08,724
Okay, that's Liz!

350
00:18:08,758 --> 00:18:10,310
I see you!

351
00:18:10,344 --> 00:18:12,206
I see you!

352
00:18:13,586 --> 00:18:16,965
Ghost mall, zombie mall,

353
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,724
dead mall!

354
00:18:19,896 --> 00:18:22,413
This mall has been in my
family for three generations,

355
00:18:22,448 --> 00:18:24,482
I never thought we'd
get these labels!

356
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:26,793
Unfortunately, sir,
pursuing anchor stores

357
00:18:26,827 --> 00:18:30,172
to lure customers in the mall
has yet to render results!

358
00:18:30,206 --> 00:18:32,206
Well, we can't survive
on Mom and Pop shops.

359
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:35,482
Okay, so what are you
saying, Mr. Fairchild?

360
00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:37,275
We face closure!

361
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:41,241
Unless we can turn this
around by New Year's.

362
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:42,793
FYI...

363
00:18:45,827 --> 00:18:49,931
We have been in
the red for years.

364
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:52,655
Just losing it faster
than we can make it.

365
00:18:52,689 --> 00:18:56,931
I have been floating
this mall on my savings.

366
00:18:56,965 --> 00:19:00,586
I have been approached

367
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,620
by Firefly Enterprises.

368
00:19:03,655 --> 00:19:05,620
The investment firm wants
to purchase the mall

369
00:19:05,655 --> 00:19:08,620
and turn it into a
fulfillment center

370
00:19:08,655 --> 00:19:10,965
for their internet
shopping company.

371
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,655
I don't want to
shut down the mall,

372
00:19:12,689 --> 00:19:15,275
but I might not have a choice.

373
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,620
Well, the good news is, sir,

374
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,275
the Christmas season
brings a good sale boost.

375
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,310
And, we got our good luck charm.

376
00:19:21,344 --> 00:19:22,941
We got the most popular
Santa in Connecticut.

377
00:19:22,965 --> 00:19:24,724
Yes!

378
00:19:24,758 --> 00:19:28,448
He is a local treasure and he's
been our Santa for decades.

379
00:19:28,482 --> 00:19:31,344
Actually, 25 years to be exact.

380
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:32,551
Perfect!

381
00:19:32,586 --> 00:19:33,862
Silver anniversary.

382
00:19:33,896 --> 00:19:37,275
We can celebrate
his years as Santa!

383
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,620
Yes!

384
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:41,517
Make this mall a holiday
event destination.

385
00:19:41,551 --> 00:19:43,586
Fairchild here.

386
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,275
Yes.

387
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,034
Yes.

388
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:51,482
What?

389
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:55,724
No! Hello?

390
00:20:01,344 --> 00:20:03,310
Santa just quit!

391
00:20:03,344 --> 00:20:05,000
What?

392
00:20:05,034 --> 00:20:08,931
He got an offer to be
Santa at Firefly's mall

393
00:20:08,965 --> 00:20:11,965
in San Francisco
for a lot more money

394
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,448
than we could ever
afford, we are screwed!

395
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:17,862
All right, I made some calls.

396
00:20:17,896 --> 00:20:20,793
These are the available Santas.
Here we go.

397
00:20:20,827 --> 00:20:22,320
Oh, he won't be driving
anyone's sleighs,

398
00:20:22,344 --> 00:20:23,931
a DUI waiting to happen, next.

399
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:25,482
Ow.

400
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:26,862
Whoa!

401
00:20:26,896 --> 00:20:27,931
This is Christmas...

402
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:29,620
not Halloween. Next.

403
00:20:30,034 --> 00:20:31,551
Oh!

404
00:20:31,586 --> 00:20:33,517
This is not Chippendale's, next!

405
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:34,896
Oh, okay! One s...

406
00:20:36,655 --> 00:20:37,965
Mm-mm.

407
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,448
This is going from
worse to worst.

408
00:20:39,482 --> 00:20:42,517
Ah...

409
00:20:42,551 --> 00:20:45,275
I guess it's back to
the drawing board.

410
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,551
- Said it, Liz.
- I tried!

411
00:21:01,862 --> 00:21:05,379
Shower.

412
00:21:18,103 --> 00:21:21,689
Ooh!

413
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,413
Mom, hurry, I'm gonna
be late for school!

414
00:21:32,448 --> 00:21:34,689
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

415
00:21:34,724 --> 00:21:35,793
- I, I told you...
- Please!

416
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:36,655
Just hold on! I have to...

417
00:21:36,689 --> 00:21:38,000
Please, don't go in!

418
00:21:38,034 --> 00:21:39,586
I forgot my briefcase!

419
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,180
- You're not gonna be late!
- Mom, stop!

420
00:21:45,034 --> 00:21:47,413
Mommy, do not go in!

421
00:21:50,379 --> 00:21:52,379
What are you doing here?

422
00:21:52,413 --> 00:21:55,034
So you owe how much mob money?

423
00:21:55,793 --> 00:21:57,551
$68,000.

424
00:21:57,586 --> 00:22:00,620
I already owed him 20.

425
00:22:00,655 --> 00:22:04,068
I did hear him say if I paid
it back, they'll let me live.

426
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:08,137
So you wanna stay here
until you get the money?

427
00:22:08,172 --> 00:22:09,793
And they don't know
nothing about us?

428
00:22:09,827 --> 00:22:12,034
No, Liz. I swear on us, Liz.

429
00:22:12,068 --> 00:22:14,965
I mean, I swear,
they know nothing.

430
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,103
We have Navaeh. We cannot
put her in harm's way.

431
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:20,793
A restraining order,
now this, Nicky?

432
00:22:20,827 --> 00:22:23,413
Excuse me, Mommy, Daddy.

433
00:22:25,827 --> 00:22:27,482
I know you think
Dad's a bad man,

434
00:22:27,517 --> 00:22:29,620
but he teaches me
good stuff, too.

435
00:22:29,655 --> 00:22:32,137
Like never double
down against face card

436
00:22:32,172 --> 00:22:33,724
and always split aces.

437
00:22:35,551 --> 00:22:39,034
It's not that I need him to
be a good influence on me.

438
00:22:39,068 --> 00:22:41,965
He needs me to be a
good influence on him.

439
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,586
We gotta help him.

440
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,655
He has no one else.

441
00:22:48,137 --> 00:22:52,068
You have to do everything
I say and stay outta sight.

442
00:22:53,482 --> 00:22:54,965
Yeah.

443
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,103
I don't do that anymore.

444
00:22:57,137 --> 00:23:00,827
Okay, well, I have to
go find a new Santa

445
00:23:00,862 --> 00:23:02,655
so I can keep my job.

446
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:05,758
I'll see y'all later.

447
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:20,044
And you've actually
worked with reindeer?

448
00:23:20,068 --> 00:23:21,827
- Liz...
- Yes, yes, real live ones.

449
00:23:21,862 --> 00:23:25,827
I want you to meet
our new Santa Claus.

450
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,517
This is James Evans.

451
00:23:27,551 --> 00:23:29,182
He just moved here from
the south side of Chicago

452
00:23:29,206 --> 00:23:32,172
with his wife, Florida,
and three children.

453
00:23:32,206 --> 00:23:35,137
He has references
from former alderman,

454
00:23:35,172 --> 00:23:39,103
Fred C. Davis and community
activist, Willona Woods.

455
00:23:41,068 --> 00:23:44,034
I'm sure you had a lot
of good times in Chicago.

456
00:23:44,068 --> 00:23:45,827
Well, hoping to make
better ones here.

457
00:23:45,862 --> 00:23:49,517
Liz, this Santa Claus
is a method actor,

458
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:53,034
so he likes to stay in
character at all times.

459
00:23:53,068 --> 00:23:55,724
So, in order to help
with his mystique,

460
00:23:55,758 --> 00:23:57,620
I will keep his
information private,

461
00:23:57,655 --> 00:24:02,034
and from now on, we will
only refer to him as Santa.

462
00:24:02,068 --> 00:24:05,068
My bad!

463
00:24:08,172 --> 00:24:10,724
Rules for being
Santa, "no cursing"?

464
00:24:10,758 --> 00:24:12,896
"No stinky eye"?

465
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:13,724
What, "no drinking"?

466
00:24:13,758 --> 00:24:15,206
- Hey!
- Hey.

467
00:24:15,241 --> 00:24:17,758
We hear you only want
to be called Santa.

468
00:24:17,793 --> 00:24:22,758
What about St. Nicholas,
Papa Noel, Father Christmas?

469
00:24:22,793 --> 00:24:24,137
None of those.

470
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:26,068
All the greats only
go by one name.

471
00:24:26,103 --> 00:24:28,172
Sade, Beyoncé,

472
00:24:28,206 --> 00:24:30,482
Prince, Santa.

473
00:24:31,758 --> 00:24:33,551
I'm Kourtney from
the Asian bistro.

474
00:24:33,586 --> 00:24:34,862
Hey, Kourtney.

475
00:24:34,896 --> 00:24:37,241
Damon, T's Teddy Town.

476
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:39,758
Hey, Damon.

477
00:24:39,793 --> 00:24:41,620
So what's your deal, Santa?

478
00:24:41,655 --> 00:24:43,551
This is a safe space.

479
00:24:43,586 --> 00:24:45,103
Tell us your story.

480
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,275
My life is an open book.

481
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:53,551
Uh, North Pole, elves, yada,
yada, ya, all that stuff.

482
00:24:53,586 --> 00:24:54,758
Whatever.

483
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,137
So this whole Santa shtick.

484
00:24:57,172 --> 00:24:59,551
You like to
role-play, is that it?

485
00:24:59,586 --> 00:25:01,344
Oh, is this your fetish?

486
00:25:01,379 --> 00:25:04,206
- Like a furry?
- Hey, okay! So, um, this mall.

487
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:06,103
This is pretty
much like a family,

488
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:09,000
and Kourtney is
our one-stop shop

489
00:25:09,034 --> 00:25:12,034
for information technology.

490
00:25:12,068 --> 00:25:14,862
- Oh, like that!
- Mm-hmm.

491
00:25:14,896 --> 00:25:17,172
Little Wendy Williams, what's
the hot topic on those two?

492
00:25:17,206 --> 00:25:18,655
Oh, okay.

493
00:25:18,689 --> 00:25:21,655
So Liz and Conrad,
or LizCon as we call them,

494
00:25:21,689 --> 00:25:23,724
they've been on the brink
of an office romance,

495
00:25:23,758 --> 00:25:26,137
but the gag is, they
haven't sealed the deal yet.

496
00:25:26,172 --> 00:25:27,103
Oh.

497
00:25:27,137 --> 00:25:29,344
I don't know why
Liz is stalling.

498
00:25:29,379 --> 00:25:32,310
Conrad is a walking
thirst trap, mm!

499
00:25:32,344 --> 00:25:34,310
I mean, you're acting
like he's supposed

500
00:25:34,344 --> 00:25:36,862
to be the next lead on "The
Bachelor" or something.

501
00:25:36,896 --> 00:25:39,034
Well, he could give
me a rose any day, mm.

502
00:25:39,068 --> 00:25:40,724
Oh, he's not all that.

503
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:43,793
I'll be back, I gotta go see
a man about a reindeer, so.

504
00:25:45,275 --> 00:25:46,965
Something's we're
gonna have to work on,

505
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,896
- but listen, what can we do?
- Okay.

506
00:26:10,344 --> 00:26:12,689
Hi, Santa.

507
00:26:12,724 --> 00:26:14,034
Here for the grindstone?

508
00:26:14,068 --> 00:26:16,931
Uh, n-no, I, I, I wanted
to ask Liz a question,

509
00:26:16,965 --> 00:26:18,724
but I didn't want
to disturb her.

510
00:26:18,758 --> 00:26:21,000
Oh, well anything you can
ask her, you can ask me.

511
00:26:21,034 --> 00:26:22,758
Oh.

512
00:26:22,793 --> 00:26:26,206
Uh, I wanted to ask her what
key she want her hos in.

513
00:26:26,241 --> 00:26:29,413
Her ho-ho-hos, 'cause you can
do it in soprano, alto, tenor...

514
00:26:29,448 --> 00:26:31,724
W-w-well, indulge me.

515
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:33,000
Oh...

516
00:26:33,034 --> 00:26:34,034
Ho-ho-ho

517
00:26:34,068 --> 00:26:35,206
or you can go ho-ho-ho...

518
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:36,344
No, no, no.

519
00:26:36,379 --> 00:26:39,965
It's all about
accentuating your hos.

520
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,724
- Mm-hmm.
- Tease your hos, twirl your hos.

521
00:26:43,758 --> 00:26:45,965
Roll your hos.

522
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,137
Ho-ho-ho!

523
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:48,896
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

524
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:51,034
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

525
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:52,724
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

526
00:26:52,758 --> 00:26:55,310
So, do you like low hos
or you want a high ho?

527
00:26:55,344 --> 00:26:56,689
Ho-ho-ho!

528
00:26:56,724 --> 00:26:57,803
I think lower is better,
don't you?

529
00:26:57,827 --> 00:26:58,896
- Ho-ho-ho.
- Ho-ho-ho.

530
00:26:58,931 --> 00:27:00,448
A good low ho is good.

531
00:27:00,482 --> 00:27:03,275
Oh, as you can see
here on the screen,

532
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,931
we were renovating the mall

533
00:27:04,965 --> 00:27:08,241
into a open-air
mix-use area, okay?

534
00:27:08,275 --> 00:27:09,827
- Mm-hmm.
- And then, we gonna...

535
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:12,931
I'm sorry. I like, I can't
keep my eyes off you.

536
00:27:14,827 --> 00:27:16,182
You know this right here,
this part right here is what

537
00:27:16,206 --> 00:27:18,827
Mr. Fairchild likes most,
right here.

538
00:27:18,862 --> 00:27:20,137
Okay, I'm sorry.

539
00:27:22,448 --> 00:27:25,068
Let me come see you, please.

540
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:27,241
Conrad, I don't know
if it's a good time.

541
00:27:27,275 --> 00:27:29,379
Nevaeh just got
back from her dad.

542
00:27:29,413 --> 00:27:31,034
- Her dad?
- Yes.

543
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:33,448
The guy you were
telling me about.

544
00:27:33,482 --> 00:27:35,241
Yeah.

545
00:27:35,275 --> 00:27:38,379
What is, is that why
you ran off to New York?

546
00:27:38,413 --> 00:27:40,448
Not exactly.

547
00:27:48,172 --> 00:27:50,827
Listen.

548
00:27:50,862 --> 00:27:55,137
I just need you to know
that I wanna make you happy.

549
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,551
What?

550
00:28:03,586 --> 00:28:05,044
Hey, you do something
different to your hair?

551
00:28:05,068 --> 00:28:06,931
- I like that.
- Hey!

552
00:28:06,965 --> 00:28:08,413
It's nice, I like it.

553
00:28:08,448 --> 00:28:10,862
A compliment from you?
Must be the Santa suit.

554
00:28:10,896 --> 00:28:14,931
Wow, that's cold. Uh, yep.

555
00:28:14,965 --> 00:28:17,862
Santa's Village, part kid zone,
part Christmas camp,

556
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:21,137
a place where the kids can
play while the parents shop.

557
00:28:21,172 --> 00:28:22,482
Really?

558
00:28:22,517 --> 00:28:24,137
What is it, condemned
or something?

559
00:28:24,172 --> 00:28:27,448
Just think, $75 an hour,
plus a Christmas bonus,

560
00:28:27,482 --> 00:28:30,068
is a way for you to
pay back the mob.

561
00:28:30,103 --> 00:28:31,482
Go get 'em, Santa.

562
00:28:32,931 --> 00:28:34,482
Okay, who first?

563
00:28:34,517 --> 00:28:37,034
What you want for
Christmas, little girl?

564
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,310
No, you...

565
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:43,137
You can hang that up, you
ain't getting none of that!

566
00:28:43,172 --> 00:28:44,551
What-what's wrong with her?

567
00:28:44,586 --> 00:28:46,517
What you doing?
It... No, get her, get her!

568
00:28:46,551 --> 00:28:48,034
Honey, are you okay?

569
00:28:48,068 --> 00:28:49,172
Get her, take her b...

570
00:28:49,206 --> 00:28:51,448
Did you just throw up on me?

571
00:28:51,482 --> 00:28:53,000
What is this?

572
00:28:54,172 --> 00:28:56,517
Ain't this about a...

573
00:28:58,344 --> 00:29:01,586
Full disclosure,
you're a disaster.

574
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,896
I've seen a lot of
Santas in my day,

575
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:06,068
and frankly, you're the worst.

576
00:29:06,103 --> 00:29:08,137
Okay, you just seen
me with one kid.

577
00:29:08,172 --> 00:29:09,965
I'm a quick judge of character.

578
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,517
It doesn't matter anyway.

579
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:13,206
I don't believe in you.

580
00:29:13,241 --> 00:29:15,379
Santa Claus is a
patriotical notion.

581
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:19,586
A propaganda tool used for
heteronormative dominance.

582
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,448
I didn't understand
nothing you just said.

583
00:29:22,482 --> 00:29:24,586
- None of it.
- Erix!

584
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,000
Erix!

585
00:29:28,172 --> 00:29:30,482
Erix, you're making me late

586
00:29:30,517 --> 00:29:33,448
for my mani, pedi,
facial, and waxing!

587
00:29:33,482 --> 00:29:37,206
What are you doing
in Santa's Village?

588
00:29:37,241 --> 00:29:40,241
You were supposed to meet
me at the food court.

589
00:29:40,275 --> 00:29:43,896
I just had a few questions
for Mr. Santa over here.

590
00:29:46,068 --> 00:29:47,172
You...

591
00:29:47,206 --> 00:29:49,172
are.. new...

592
00:29:49,206 --> 00:29:52,034
- Santa?
- Yeah.

593
00:29:52,068 --> 00:29:54,379
How did you get this job?

594
00:29:54,413 --> 00:29:57,620
Is it, is it Make
A Wish Foundation?

595
00:29:57,655 --> 00:29:59,896
It's just, um...

596
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:04,172
I didn't think that our
mall Santa would be so...

597
00:30:04,206 --> 00:30:05,034
Hot.

598
00:30:05,068 --> 00:30:06,586
So tempting.

599
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,034
A lot of people say
this is Phat Klein.

600
00:30:09,068 --> 00:30:10,379
What you think?

601
00:30:11,931 --> 00:30:14,586
Our mall used to have standards

602
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:18,275
before we got our Santas
off of the discount racks

603
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,965
and the FEMA lines!

604
00:30:21,034 --> 00:30:22,862
Well, ho-ho-ho to you, too!

605
00:30:22,896 --> 00:30:25,310
I'm going to call the
manager on you, Santa!

606
00:30:25,344 --> 00:30:26,344
I already called him.

607
00:30:26,379 --> 00:30:31,103
Ho-ho-ho, Karen!

608
00:30:31,137 --> 00:30:32,965
- Yes?
- Liz,

609
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,103
customers are complaining
about the new Santa, okay?

610
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:36,965
We both know what that means.

611
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,586
I said he was a stand-in
until the real Santa got here,

612
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,586
somebody can keep this
going 'til Christmas.

613
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,275
Let's hope so.

614
00:30:49,137 --> 00:30:50,034
Hey, baby.

615
00:30:50,068 --> 00:30:51,241
Hi, Daddy.

616
00:30:51,275 --> 00:30:54,034
Santa's Village was empty!

617
00:30:54,068 --> 00:30:55,551
It was emptier than my wallet.

618
00:30:55,586 --> 00:30:58,275
Emptier than the emptiest
bowl of emptiness.

619
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,344
It was terrible.

620
00:31:00,379 --> 00:31:03,655
- It'll pick up, I'm sure of it.
- Yeah.

621
00:31:03,689 --> 00:31:05,965
You know what Santa's
Village needs?

622
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,275
We need a milkshake.

623
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,379
A milkshake? What flavor?

624
00:31:10,413 --> 00:31:13,068
No, not the dessert. The appeal.

625
00:31:13,103 --> 00:31:15,482
Look, if...

626
00:31:15,517 --> 00:31:19,517
If all the milkshakes
bring boys to the yard,

627
00:31:19,551 --> 00:31:21,527
we need something to bring
all the kids to the village.

628
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:23,482
- Hey, guys, what are you doing?
- -Hey.

629
00:31:23,517 --> 00:31:26,068
But you're the milkshake, Daddy.

630
00:31:26,103 --> 00:31:28,172
You know what?

631
00:31:28,206 --> 00:31:31,275
If that's the case, I gotta
get into the soul of Santa.

632
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,689
I gotta get under the skin.

633
00:31:33,724 --> 00:31:35,655
Mommy, since it's my
last day of school

634
00:31:35,689 --> 00:31:39,965
before the holidays, can I be
Santa's helper at the mall?

635
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,413
Please, please, please, please?

636
00:31:41,448 --> 00:31:43,448
Okay, okay!

637
00:31:43,482 --> 00:31:46,965
Now look, no one can
know he's your dad!

638
00:31:50,172 --> 00:31:52,344
I see some things never change.

639
00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:53,689
Yep.

640
00:31:53,724 --> 00:31:55,310
Hey, I've been
intending to ask you,

641
00:31:55,344 --> 00:31:58,965
what is it with all this
new age glow up in here?

642
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,206
Well, what's wrong with
me bettering myself?

643
00:32:02,241 --> 00:32:03,424
Uh, you just taking this thing

644
00:32:03,448 --> 00:32:05,034
to a whole 'nother level, huh?

645
00:32:05,068 --> 00:32:07,034
Well, somebody has to.

646
00:32:07,068 --> 00:32:09,413
Did she just come for me?

647
00:32:09,448 --> 00:32:11,413
Oh, I have goals, too!

648
00:32:11,448 --> 00:32:13,241
Okay, you don't get it.
Okay, look.

649
00:32:13,275 --> 00:32:14,724
So. Okay, imagine.

650
00:32:14,758 --> 00:32:17,655
A virtual reality
state-of-the-art facility,

651
00:32:17,689 --> 00:32:20,379
where each room has
its own pop culture

652
00:32:20,413 --> 00:32:21,655
that dates back a century.

653
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,413
There's gonna be dancing.

654
00:32:24,448 --> 00:32:25,689
Like that.

655
00:32:25,724 --> 00:32:27,241
There's gonna be music.

656
00:32:29,103 --> 00:32:32,206
Also fashion, we gonna have
fashion up in that piece.

657
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,344
Oh, at our place,

658
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:36,724
we'll create a
nostalgia-induced experience

659
00:32:36,758 --> 00:32:38,344
that's gonna be just for you.

660
00:32:38,379 --> 00:32:42,379
At Timeless, it's always
gonna be your party.

661
00:32:42,413 --> 00:32:44,068
You... just look at that.

662
00:32:44,103 --> 00:32:45,517
Look at the wiggle.

663
00:32:45,551 --> 00:32:46,562
Look at the wiggle,
this is at Timeless.

664
00:32:46,586 --> 00:32:48,344
This is what
happens at Timeless.

665
00:32:48,379 --> 00:32:49,517
Okay, okay!

666
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,758
All right, okay!

667
00:32:50,793 --> 00:32:53,206
Daddy, you never told
me how you and Mommy

668
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:55,103
made this Timeless idea!

669
00:32:55,137 --> 00:32:56,551
- Oh.
- Well...

670
00:32:56,586 --> 00:32:59,034
I'm sorry, guys, I
have a conference call.

671
00:32:59,068 --> 00:33:02,241
You remember the club I
told you about in Jersey.

672
00:33:02,275 --> 00:33:05,310
That's "Stella's,"
named after grandma.

673
00:33:05,344 --> 00:33:07,827
Yep. God rest her soul.

674
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:10,689
Yep. You know, your mom
was the main attraction.

675
00:33:10,724 --> 00:33:13,137
Everybody wanted
to hear her sing.

676
00:33:13,172 --> 00:33:14,586
Mommy sang?

677
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:18,241
She was amazing!

678
00:33:18,275 --> 00:33:24,034
But, Daddy's mistakes
caused us to lose the club.

679
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:28,275
Yeah, I caused us
to lose everything.

680
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:31,310
But I wanna keep my
promise to Mommy.

681
00:33:35,448 --> 00:33:37,310
Wish I knew more.

682
00:33:37,344 --> 00:33:41,827
Nicky drank, gambled,
picked up your cash.

683
00:33:41,862 --> 00:33:45,344
Other than that, he's a blank.

684
00:33:45,379 --> 00:33:49,413
Understood.

685
00:33:49,448 --> 00:33:52,655
Here's a donation
for your soccer team.

686
00:33:52,689 --> 00:33:56,310
I was a kickass
goalie back in school.

687
00:33:58,379 --> 00:33:59,827
You ever needed a team sponsor,

688
00:33:59,862 --> 00:34:03,482
Paddy Kake Chiropractic
is available.

689
00:34:07,172 --> 00:34:08,862
Nicky,

690
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:10,206
hope you're okay.

691
00:34:14,413 --> 00:34:16,517
Why did you tell Nevaeh
about Jersey days?

692
00:34:16,551 --> 00:34:18,310
We agreed that we wouldn't.

693
00:34:18,344 --> 00:34:20,424
Well, I didn't wanna lie to
her and tell her anymore...

694
00:34:20,448 --> 00:34:21,803
But if you're gonna
tell her the truth,

695
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:23,344
tell her the whole truth!

696
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:24,665
Did you tell her how you
gambled away our house,

697
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:27,862
- our savings, the nightclub?
- Oh.

698
00:34:27,896 --> 00:34:30,206
You promised you wouldn't
be like your dad.

699
00:34:30,241 --> 00:34:31,724
Okay, don't bring up my dad.

700
00:34:31,758 --> 00:34:33,655
But when God blessed
us with Nevaeh,

701
00:34:33,689 --> 00:34:37,517
I had to end this cycle
for her, for her sake!

702
00:34:37,551 --> 00:34:38,827
I begged you, Nicky.

703
00:34:38,862 --> 00:34:40,251
- Oh, you think I...
- Oh, yes I did!

704
00:34:40,275 --> 00:34:41,827
You don't think I
know I messed up?

705
00:34:41,862 --> 00:34:43,424
I gave you an ultimatum
to change and you didn't!

706
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,655
You didn't, Nicky!

707
00:34:45,689 --> 00:34:48,379
And you wonder why I
don't sing anymore.

708
00:34:59,241 --> 00:35:00,448
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

709
00:35:00,482 --> 00:35:02,724
You wanna build a
bigger audience?

710
00:35:02,758 --> 00:35:04,551
You gotta go to bed sooner!

711
00:35:04,586 --> 00:35:05,700
Okay, wait a minute,
is it six of y'all?

712
00:35:05,724 --> 00:35:07,275
What is going on?

713
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,862
It's a Santa crash course.

714
00:35:08,896 --> 00:35:10,758
Image is everything
when you're Santa.

715
00:35:10,793 --> 00:35:13,551
Us kids may not remember
every gift for Christmas,

716
00:35:13,586 --> 00:35:16,379
but we'll never
forget our Santa.

717
00:35:22,758 --> 00:35:24,551
She peed.

718
00:35:24,586 --> 00:35:25,724
You gotta wrap gifts better

719
00:35:25,758 --> 00:35:27,862
than Macy's gift
wrapping expert.

720
00:35:27,896 --> 00:35:29,448
See?

721
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,448
Master the jolly
laugh, bellybutton rub,

722
00:35:34,482 --> 00:35:37,862
and do it in all
different languages, hm!

723
00:35:37,896 --> 00:35:39,379
Merry Christmas!

724
00:35:39,413 --> 00:35:42,206
Feliz Navidad! Buon Natale!

725
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:44,275
Joyeux Noelle!

726
00:35:45,896 --> 00:35:49,758
You are now ready
to work that mall!

727
00:35:51,758 --> 00:35:53,344
Well, thank you, Santa sensei.

728
00:36:05,793 --> 00:36:07,793
That's funny.

729
00:36:07,827 --> 00:36:10,586
Liz, we gonna rock
this Christmas.

730
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,034
Rock Christmas?

731
00:36:12,068 --> 00:36:13,965
I love that, now that's
enthusiasm, Santa.

732
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,827
Um, morning Santa,
how can I help you?

733
00:36:16,862 --> 00:36:18,965
Uh, I just came to check in.

734
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,965
So, uh, I hear our
little Nevaeh here

735
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,655
is gonna be a Santa's
helper this year.

736
00:36:22,689 --> 00:36:24,310
Yeah, um, Nevaeh is.

737
00:36:24,344 --> 00:36:26,517
Uh, uh, well thank you
for coming by, Santa.

738
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,310
Yeah, anytime. Thank you.

739
00:36:28,344 --> 00:36:29,976
Hey, hey, now you make
sure you don't break

740
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,040
any child labor laws working
our little Nevaeh here.

741
00:36:32,068 --> 00:36:35,448
You know, I'd like to break
my foot off in his little...

742
00:36:37,344 --> 00:36:38,527
Um, Nevaeh. Come on, we'll
take you to Santa's Village.

743
00:36:38,551 --> 00:36:39,631
- Okay.
- I'm sure Santa would...

744
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,000
No, I can walk you.

745
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:43,275
We haven't caught up
anyway since New York.

746
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,803
Well, Conrad, you and I have
paperwork we need to discuss.

747
00:36:46,827 --> 00:36:49,482
I'm sure Santa wouldn't mind
taking her, right Santa?

748
00:36:49,517 --> 00:36:51,379
Right. Don't mind at all.

749
00:36:51,413 --> 00:36:53,700
All right, well, ay, you make
sure you knock 'em dead, tiger.

750
00:36:53,724 --> 00:36:56,620
Yeah, knock 'em dead.

751
00:36:56,655 --> 00:36:58,620
Come on 'fore I bite him.

752
00:36:59,827 --> 00:37:02,413
Daddy, you almost broke cover!

753
00:37:02,448 --> 00:37:04,344
I know, that's so unlike me!

754
00:37:04,379 --> 00:37:06,689
- You've gotta tighten up!
- Yeah.

755
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,344
Hey, tell me about
this dude Conrad.

756
00:37:08,379 --> 00:37:10,827
I can't get a read on him,
it's just weird.

757
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:12,517
He's pretty cool.

758
00:37:12,551 --> 00:37:13,793
Pretty cool?

759
00:37:13,827 --> 00:37:15,379
Y'all spend much time together?

760
00:37:15,413 --> 00:37:18,655
No, but I think he likes Mommy.

761
00:37:18,689 --> 00:37:20,551
Does she like him?

762
00:37:20,586 --> 00:37:21,827
Not sure, maybe.

763
00:37:21,862 --> 00:37:25,413
Hmm, maybe. Uh, where you going?

764
00:37:25,448 --> 00:37:26,862
You passed the crash course.

765
00:37:26,896 --> 00:37:29,862
Now it's time to leave
the bread crumbs.

766
00:37:29,896 --> 00:37:31,068
Come on!

767
00:37:31,103 --> 00:37:33,034
Conrad ever been over
your house late at night?

768
00:37:34,827 --> 00:37:35,907
- Come on, Daddy!
- I'm coming!

769
00:37:35,931 --> 00:37:38,379
- Work with me!
- I'm coming!

770
00:37:38,413 --> 00:37:40,517
It's free samples from
stores around the mall.

771
00:37:40,551 --> 00:37:42,758
Mommy uses these
for promo purposes,

772
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:43,931
and we are, too!

773
00:37:43,965 --> 00:37:46,413
Okay. What do you
you want me to do?

774
00:37:46,448 --> 00:37:49,517
Hold this bag so I can put
the free samples in there.

775
00:37:49,551 --> 00:37:51,689
Okay, free samples, wow!

776
00:37:51,724 --> 00:37:53,000
- Yep!
- All right!

777
00:37:53,034 --> 00:37:54,862
- Ho-ho-ho!
- Santa's Village over there!

778
00:37:54,896 --> 00:37:56,551
Merry Christmas,
Merry Christmas.

779
00:37:56,586 --> 00:37:57,896
Come see us at Santa's Village.

780
00:37:57,931 --> 00:37:59,793
Merry Christmas, Santa's
Village over there!

781
00:37:59,827 --> 00:38:01,068
Come see us at Santa's Village.

782
00:38:01,103 --> 00:38:03,034
Everybody, see us
at Santa's Village

783
00:38:03,068 --> 00:38:06,724
for carol, songs,
and Santa time!

784
00:38:06,758 --> 00:38:09,586
Oh, look, look, kids!

785
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,000
Kids!

786
00:38:11,034 --> 00:38:13,724
Ay, who wants to write a
letter to The North Pole?

787
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:15,586
- Come on!
- Come on.

788
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,976
Tell me you wouldn't
wanna make friends

789
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,103
with Santa's elves
in the North Pole?

790
00:38:19,137 --> 00:38:20,482
I know I do!

791
00:38:21,448 --> 00:38:22,586
Yes!

792
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,103
Why are they writing?

793
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:27,724
Wouldn't it be easier
to text it or DM it?

794
00:38:27,758 --> 00:38:28,793
No!

795
00:38:28,827 --> 00:38:30,827
Magic happens when you write!

796
00:38:30,862 --> 00:38:34,379
It transforms into
something real.

797
00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:38,034
Okay, here, you guys can take
these right on over there.

798
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:41,827
I'm circling back
vis-à-vis our last chat.

799
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:44,758
Okay, what is it with
the Santa inquisition?

800
00:38:44,793 --> 00:38:47,517
Tell me about your
life on the North Pole.

801
00:38:47,551 --> 00:38:48,791
Okay, have a seat, have a seat.

802
00:38:49,965 --> 00:38:51,827
You wanna know about my life?

803
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,137
Okay, let me tell you.

804
00:38:53,172 --> 00:38:55,517
Everybody wants to be Santa.

805
00:38:55,551 --> 00:38:57,655
Do you know that
Frosty the Snowman

806
00:38:57,689 --> 00:39:00,827
and The Little Drummer
Boy tried to take my job?

807
00:39:00,862 --> 00:39:04,896
And Scrooge had an affair
with Mrs. Claus! Yes!

808
00:39:04,931 --> 00:39:06,482
Jingle Bells tried
to get me caught up

809
00:39:06,517 --> 00:39:08,000
in some "Me Too" scandal,

810
00:39:08,034 --> 00:39:10,827
and The Ghost of Christmas Past,
Present, and Future

811
00:39:10,862 --> 00:39:12,448
all held me at gunpoint,

812
00:39:12,482 --> 00:39:14,172
while Dancer, Prancer,
Cupid, and Comet

813
00:39:14,206 --> 00:39:16,206
all tried to take my sled.

814
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:18,482
And you know who the
ringleader was, don't you?

815
00:39:18,517 --> 00:39:21,206
Yes, that's right, Rudolph
with his shiny nose.

816
00:39:21,241 --> 00:39:22,827
And don't get me started

817
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:24,689
what The Nutcracker
tried to do to me!

818
00:39:24,724 --> 00:39:26,896
Yeah, right!

819
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,758
Sure, Santa!

820
00:39:31,896 --> 00:39:33,103
No!

821
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,724
Oh, no!

822
00:39:34,758 --> 00:39:35,758
No, no, no, no!

823
00:39:37,034 --> 00:39:38,551
I take it you got that alert.

824
00:39:38,586 --> 00:39:42,517
Our mall is getting skewered
all over the Internet!

825
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:48,517
Our rating has fallen
from a 3.9 to a 1 in one day!

826
00:39:48,551 --> 00:39:51,172
Bad-mouthing the business on
the Internet is one thing,

827
00:39:51,206 --> 00:39:53,482
but a slander campaign, come on,
that's something else.

828
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:56,551
And their biggest issue
seems to be new Santa!

829
00:39:56,586 --> 00:40:02,172
I just need us to break even
before the New Year, or, or...

830
00:40:04,482 --> 00:40:06,217
Keeping the mall alive
just doesn't make sense,

831
00:40:06,241 --> 00:40:09,965
and now, we may have to
get rid of new Santa.

832
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,034
I hate to say it, he's right.

833
00:40:12,068 --> 00:40:14,482
Well, I just got a
text from my lawyer.

834
00:40:14,517 --> 00:40:16,620
They spoke with the
review site who agreed

835
00:40:16,655 --> 00:40:20,068
that a rate fall that fast
goes against any algorithm.

836
00:40:20,103 --> 00:40:22,034
Well, even if it's
not Santa's fault,

837
00:40:22,068 --> 00:40:25,551
we cannot afford to
tarnish our brand.

838
00:40:25,586 --> 00:40:27,137
Well, with all due respect, sir,

839
00:40:27,172 --> 00:40:29,517
what we can't afford is
to allow outside forces

840
00:40:29,551 --> 00:40:30,862
to control us.

841
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:32,827
If we give into the
Internet trolls,

842
00:40:32,862 --> 00:40:36,206
the corporate wolves
would eat us alive!

843
00:40:37,931 --> 00:40:40,827
The reviews should
be down in 48 hours.

844
00:40:40,862 --> 00:40:44,103
Hey, I support you guys 100%.

845
00:40:44,137 --> 00:40:45,482
Thank you.

846
00:40:47,896 --> 00:40:52,517
I thought that when I grew up,

847
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:54,034
I would become a gallerist.

848
00:40:54,068 --> 00:40:57,034
Artist, bourgeoisie.

849
00:40:57,068 --> 00:40:58,551
So what happened?

850
00:40:58,586 --> 00:41:01,275
My father passed away.

851
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:04,172
Mall fell on my
shoulders, end of story.

852
00:41:04,206 --> 00:41:05,827
Well, I had dreams, too.

853
00:41:05,862 --> 00:41:09,586
I, I was a lounge singer,
if you can believe that.

854
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,931
Really?

855
00:41:11,965 --> 00:41:14,068
I never would've caught that.

856
00:41:14,103 --> 00:41:15,068
Hmm.

857
00:41:15,103 --> 00:41:17,206
If you don't mind
me asking, sir,

858
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:22,034
h-how did your marriage survive
trading dreams for careers?

859
00:41:22,068 --> 00:41:23,793
Mines couldn't.

860
00:41:23,827 --> 00:41:26,034
Well, it wasn't easy.

861
00:41:27,758 --> 00:41:29,931
Got ugly at times,

862
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:32,896
but we had to
redefine happiness.

863
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,793
Find the beauty in the struggle.

864
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,034
- Touchdown, yes!
- Yes, yes!

865
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:44,172
We gon' beat them!

866
00:41:44,206 --> 00:41:45,965
- Score!
- Yes!

867
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,655
Ooh, so who's winning,
what's the spread?

868
00:41:47,689 --> 00:41:50,103
- New York, plus seven points!
- All right!

869
00:41:50,137 --> 00:41:51,251
Let's go, baby, let's go, baby!

870
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:53,068
Come on, Big Blue,
come on, Big Blue!

871
00:41:55,206 --> 00:41:56,586
Woo-hoo!

872
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,206
Yes!

873
00:41:58,241 --> 00:42:00,724
Liz, I know you all
enlightened and stuff,

874
00:42:00,758 --> 00:42:02,034
but why won't you let us put

875
00:42:02,068 --> 00:42:03,965
some real Christmas
decorations up?

876
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,310
O-or is that gonna
mess with your chi?

877
00:42:06,344 --> 00:42:09,000
What are you talking about?
This house is decorated!

878
00:42:09,034 --> 00:42:11,241
Girl, look at that tree!
That ain't no real decoration.

879
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:12,793
My tree looks good!

880
00:42:12,827 --> 00:42:14,241
Look like a Charlie
Brown Christmas.

881
00:42:14,275 --> 00:42:15,793
Oh!

882
00:42:15,827 --> 00:42:17,182
That thing catch on
fire if your spark that.

883
00:42:17,206 --> 00:42:19,034
That ain't no real tree.

884
00:42:19,068 --> 00:42:21,241
Come on, let us, let us
lighten the place up.

885
00:42:21,275 --> 00:42:23,862
Come on, let us slay
this house, right?

886
00:42:23,896 --> 00:42:26,103
We gon' slay this house!

887
00:42:26,137 --> 00:42:29,068
- We gon' slay this house!
- We gon' slay this house!

888
00:42:29,103 --> 00:42:31,241
Woo! We gon' slay this house!

889
00:42:31,275 --> 00:42:32,827
Woo!

890
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:40,758
Searched the
burroughs, no Nicky.

891
00:42:40,793 --> 00:42:44,068
My contact hasn't been able to
track the cell phone, either.

892
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:47,344
So what do you wanna do next?

893
00:42:47,379 --> 00:42:49,896
Up the bounty to 20k.

894
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:04,758
Okay.

895
00:43:04,793 --> 00:43:06,793
What is it with this mall?

896
00:43:06,827 --> 00:43:10,310
Low morale, lackluster
salesmen, bad advertising.

897
00:43:10,344 --> 00:43:12,344
It's a retail apocalypse.

898
00:43:12,379 --> 00:43:14,241
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, I agree,

899
00:43:14,275 --> 00:43:16,206
but unfortunately,
it's been that way.

900
00:43:16,241 --> 00:43:18,172
Well, it don't have
to stay that way.

901
00:43:18,206 --> 00:43:20,034
I can turn this place around.

902
00:43:20,068 --> 00:43:21,965
The Donald may have
the art of the deal,

903
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,034
but I have the
art of the hustle.

904
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,034
Well, I'm willing
to try anything,

905
00:43:26,068 --> 00:43:27,793
'cause if this mall shuts down,

906
00:43:27,827 --> 00:43:30,344
unemployment lines are
not a good journey for me.

907
00:43:30,379 --> 00:43:33,034
Yeah, but you would have
to run any strategic ideas

908
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:35,275
by mall management and...

909
00:43:37,206 --> 00:43:40,172
Cuffing season for
the almost lovers.

910
00:43:40,206 --> 00:43:43,310
Can you feel the
heat from here? Woo!

911
00:43:43,344 --> 00:43:45,034
Sure, whatever.

912
00:43:45,068 --> 00:43:47,172
Let me tell you how the
360 mall reboot plan

913
00:43:47,206 --> 00:43:48,310
will work, okay?

914
00:43:48,344 --> 00:43:50,034
I'll be back in a sec.

915
00:43:50,068 --> 00:43:51,896
I created the plan.

916
00:43:51,931 --> 00:43:54,344
I know, I know, and it was a
great little plan in theory.

917
00:43:54,379 --> 00:43:55,872
But you know, in the
real world, you know,

918
00:43:55,896 --> 00:43:57,217
theory has to be
put into practice.

919
00:43:57,241 --> 00:43:58,931
- I'll say.
- Yeah.

920
00:43:58,965 --> 00:44:00,413
Can I speak with
you for a second?

921
00:44:00,448 --> 00:44:01,931
- Oh.
- Uh, we're having lunch.

922
00:44:01,965 --> 00:44:03,068
Can it wait?

923
00:44:05,862 --> 00:44:07,137
Just one second.

924
00:44:11,344 --> 00:44:13,044
Why are you letting him
mansplain you like that?

925
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:15,068
Being all condescending?

926
00:44:15,103 --> 00:44:16,251
You wouldn't have
never let me get away

927
00:44:16,275 --> 00:44:17,965
with that back in the day.

928
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,413
It's not back in the day
and you don't know him.

929
00:44:20,448 --> 00:44:23,068
He is my biggest
support in this mall.

930
00:44:23,103 --> 00:44:24,965
So mind your business, Nicky!

931
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,758
Mind my business?

932
00:44:29,275 --> 00:44:31,103
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

933
00:44:31,137 --> 00:44:33,068
Okay.

934
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:34,413
So yeah, as I, as I w...

935
00:44:34,448 --> 00:44:37,241
I have a few mall
improvement ideas.

936
00:44:39,965 --> 00:44:42,413
That's cute, Santa, but uh,
I think mall improvements

937
00:44:42,448 --> 00:44:44,793
are a little bit
above your pay grade.

938
00:44:44,827 --> 00:44:47,241
I was talking to Liz.

939
00:44:47,275 --> 00:44:48,758
It's Ms. Cole.

940
00:44:48,793 --> 00:44:51,172
And, uh, the next time
that I need my time

941
00:44:51,206 --> 00:44:53,379
or my meeting
needlessly interrupted,

942
00:44:53,413 --> 00:44:56,241
I'll be sure to call you.
Thanks, Santa.

943
00:44:56,275 --> 00:44:58,965
- This m... He don't know...
- Would you...

944
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,827
Thank you, Santa.

945
00:45:03,344 --> 00:45:06,034
Looks like you caught a
fade from Prince Conrad.

946
00:45:06,068 --> 00:45:07,241
Straight canceled!

947
00:45:07,275 --> 00:45:10,275
Listen, Conrad is a butthole

948
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:11,827
in all caps.

949
00:45:11,862 --> 00:45:14,206
Everyone here has a
nightmare Conrad story.

950
00:45:14,241 --> 00:45:15,896
- Mm-hmm.
- It's like

951
00:45:15,931 --> 00:45:17,148
some type of right of
passage or something.

952
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:18,793
Conrad is a whole snack,

953
00:45:18,827 --> 00:45:21,310
but he is too extra
in all the wrong ways.

954
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:24,000
Oh, you've been summoned, Kourt.

955
00:45:26,448 --> 00:45:29,965
That's the third time
today he's sent back food!

956
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,310
What a idiot!

957
00:45:35,206 --> 00:45:36,482
We're a buffet, Conrad,

958
00:45:36,517 --> 00:45:38,517
which means we
don't cook to order.

959
00:45:38,551 --> 00:45:40,310
He's got some nerve!

960
00:45:40,344 --> 00:45:44,103
I think Conrad needs a little
something extra in his food.

961
00:45:44,137 --> 00:45:46,172
Here.

962
00:45:46,206 --> 00:45:47,310
There.

963
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:49,137
- Oh, that oughta get it!
- Yeah.

964
00:45:49,172 --> 00:45:50,413
A little bit more.

965
00:45:50,448 --> 00:45:52,034
Oh, okay.

966
00:45:52,068 --> 00:45:55,310
Uh, for the homies!

967
00:45:55,344 --> 00:45:56,827
Mm!

968
00:45:57,482 --> 00:45:58,827
Bon appetit!

969
00:45:58,862 --> 00:46:01,034
Ah, merci beaucoup, mon amie!

970
00:46:01,068 --> 00:46:02,344
Thank you so much.

971
00:46:12,551 --> 00:46:14,310
Ah, magnifique!

972
00:46:14,344 --> 00:46:16,413
So uh, where were we?

973
00:46:16,448 --> 00:46:18,379
You were just agreeing
with my data analysis,

974
00:46:18,413 --> 00:46:20,241
but disagreeing
at the same time.

975
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,206
Before that.

976
00:46:23,241 --> 00:46:24,631
You were telling me
to trust your opinion,

977
00:46:24,655 --> 00:46:28,241
even if I had prior
knowledge to the contrary.

978
00:46:28,275 --> 00:46:30,896
- Before that.
- Conrad!

979
00:46:30,931 --> 00:46:34,000
I was telling you how
beautiful you are.

980
00:46:34,034 --> 00:46:35,000
Well, thanks!

981
00:46:35,034 --> 00:46:37,068
Mm-hmm. It's the truth.

982
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:41,034
- Is it better?
- Mm-hmm! Much better!

983
00:46:46,551 --> 00:46:49,137
Here we go. We got action.

984
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:53,068
What?

985
00:46:53,103 --> 00:46:54,379
What is it? You okay?

986
00:46:54,413 --> 00:46:55,517
What, what is it?

987
00:46:58,413 --> 00:46:59,620
We got a splatter!

988
00:46:59,655 --> 00:47:01,206
Oh, my God!

989
00:47:01,241 --> 00:47:04,172
Ay, forget about
mall management, eh?

990
00:47:04,206 --> 00:47:06,000
Forget it!

991
00:47:06,034 --> 00:47:08,074
I always knew he was full
of shh... Shut your mouth!

992
00:47:10,655 --> 00:47:15,103
Santa, teach us the art
of the hustle, ASAP.

993
00:47:15,137 --> 00:47:16,689
- That part!
- Yeah.

994
00:47:16,724 --> 00:47:18,310
You ready?

995
00:47:18,344 --> 00:47:19,586
Don't matter where you're from,

996
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,689
everybody's buying or selling.

997
00:47:21,724 --> 00:47:23,655
If you can find out
what a person want,

998
00:47:23,689 --> 00:47:25,931
they'll buy anything
you're selling.

999
00:47:25,965 --> 00:47:29,482
Most people base their
choices on five emotions.

1000
00:47:29,517 --> 00:47:31,068
Greed...

1001
00:47:31,103 --> 00:47:33,137
lust,

1002
00:47:33,172 --> 00:47:35,034
compassion,

1003
00:47:35,068 --> 00:47:36,482
vanity

1004
00:47:36,517 --> 00:47:38,517
and desperation.

1005
00:47:38,551 --> 00:47:41,206
Customers, they're your marks.

1006
00:47:41,241 --> 00:47:44,103
Salespeople are your grifters.

1007
00:47:44,137 --> 00:47:47,000
Co-workers, shields.

1008
00:47:47,034 --> 00:47:48,965
These are your steps.

1009
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,172
Step one is debate.

1010
00:47:51,206 --> 00:47:53,275
Find out what the marks want.

1011
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:56,551
Step two is your hook.

1012
00:47:56,586 --> 00:48:00,172
Attach what they want
with what you're selling.

1013
00:48:00,206 --> 00:48:02,620
Step three is the real.

1014
00:48:02,655 --> 00:48:06,724
Gain their trust
and seal the deal.

1015
00:48:08,689 --> 00:48:10,034
You got it?

1016
00:48:10,068 --> 00:48:12,034
Let the con games begin.

1017
00:48:12,068 --> 00:48:13,344
Hey!

1018
00:48:25,206 --> 00:48:27,448
- Hey!
- Hey.

1019
00:48:28,275 --> 00:48:30,034
My first paycheck!

1020
00:48:30,068 --> 00:48:34,413
I asked Mr. Fairchild to
pay me in cash and he did.

1021
00:48:34,448 --> 00:48:36,379
So why are you giving it to me?

1022
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:39,172
'Cause I had a hard time
helping you with child support.

1023
00:48:39,206 --> 00:48:40,655
You never asked.

1024
00:48:40,689 --> 00:48:43,344
So, I wanted to
make it up to you.

1025
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:46,034
You should be using this
to pay back the mob.

1026
00:48:46,068 --> 00:48:48,689
Nah, making amends with
you is much more important.

1027
00:48:48,724 --> 00:48:52,551
And it's legitimate
cash for a change.

1028
00:48:52,586 --> 00:48:54,586
You know what?
I'll tell you what I'll do.

1029
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:57,724
I'll put this toward the
free-Nicky-from-the-mob fund.

1030
00:48:59,413 --> 00:49:02,551
Okay, let me see your
360 mall reboot plan.

1031
00:49:02,586 --> 00:49:05,655
I heard you talking about it.

1032
00:49:05,689 --> 00:49:07,172
You really wanna know?

1033
00:49:07,206 --> 00:49:10,620
I always wanna know what's
going on in your head.

1034
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:13,689
- Oh, okay. All right, let me show you. Here it is.
- Okay.

1035
00:49:13,724 --> 00:49:16,413
♪ Hey, jingle bells,

What's your secret?

1043
00:49:30,793 --> 00:49:32,724
Uh, my cousin Lavita
Alizé Jenkins works

So why didn't you join us?

it has to be substantive.

1057
00:50:02,275 --> 00:50:06,586
Like a spiritual soldiering
or a morning constitutional.

1058
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:09,827
Okay.

1059
00:50:17,206 --> 00:50:19,068
Daddy, what's wrong?

1060
00:50:19,103 --> 00:50:20,482
The kids are happy.

1061
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,413
You're doing great
with the mall workers.

1062
00:50:22,448 --> 00:50:25,310
Using your naughty skills
for something nice.

1063
00:50:25,344 --> 00:50:27,448
Yeah, but Erix makes
the Santa's Village

1064
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:29,620
look like a jail sentence!

1065
00:50:29,655 --> 00:50:32,793
If you can teach the mall
workers the magic of the hustle,

1066
00:50:32,827 --> 00:50:35,620
why can't you give
some magic to Erix?

1067
00:50:35,655 --> 00:50:37,137
You know what?

1068
00:50:37,172 --> 00:50:39,068
You're right, you're right!

1069
00:50:39,103 --> 00:50:40,482
Erix!

1070
00:50:40,517 --> 00:50:41,586
Come here!

1071
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:52,137
I wanna make you Santa's
helper along with Nevaeh.

1072
00:50:52,172 --> 00:50:54,448
How much does it pay per hour?

1073
00:50:55,655 --> 00:50:57,310
No pay?

1074
00:50:57,344 --> 00:50:58,827
Why do you do it, Nevaeh?

1075
00:50:58,862 --> 00:51:01,896
'Cause she's a Santa's
helper, she volunteers!

1076
00:51:01,931 --> 00:51:03,896
Yes, but her mom works here.

1077
00:51:03,931 --> 00:51:06,620
Well, just consider
it community service.

1078
00:51:06,655 --> 00:51:08,379
Can I at least get a certificate

1079
00:51:08,413 --> 00:51:11,206
to put in my college
application folder?

1080
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:19,137
Do you have this shirt
in a Oxford button-down

1081
00:51:19,172 --> 00:51:20,482
or polo style?

1082
00:51:26,517 --> 00:51:28,172
People are talking!

1083
00:51:28,206 --> 00:51:29,872
There's whispers out there
that Nicky robbed me!

1084
00:51:29,896 --> 00:51:32,241
That I got fleeced by a drunk!

1085
00:51:33,827 --> 00:51:35,413
Told you!

1086
00:51:35,448 --> 00:51:37,310
If you don't take this guy out,

1087
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,482
street's gonna think
you're going soft.

1088
00:51:39,517 --> 00:51:41,862
You forget about taking
on a commission, hmm?

1089
00:51:41,896 --> 00:51:44,655
You tell all the bounties
from Vegas to Atlantic City,

1090
00:51:44,689 --> 00:51:47,413
I want Nicky dead! Dead!

1091
00:51:47,448 --> 00:51:48,482
Ah, dammit!

1092
00:51:51,689 --> 00:51:53,620
Got your coat, have a seat.
Go ahead, I got it.

1093
00:51:53,655 --> 00:51:54,862
Okay, okay.

1094
00:52:01,344 --> 00:52:02,413
No fever. Are you okay?

1095
00:52:02,448 --> 00:52:03,827
- No, I'm fine.
- Oh.

1096
00:52:03,862 --> 00:52:05,758
- Have, have a seat.
- Okay, okay, okay!

1097
00:52:10,896 --> 00:52:13,482
Parenting is about
meeting halfway.

1098
00:52:13,517 --> 00:52:17,379
So, I made something
healthy for you

1099
00:52:17,413 --> 00:52:19,896
and slap-your-mama-good for me.

1100
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:24,655
Okay!

1101
00:52:24,689 --> 00:52:26,241
All right!

1102
00:52:26,275 --> 00:52:28,310
I call it Vegan Soul Food.

1103
00:52:28,344 --> 00:52:30,379
- Oh, okay.
- Let's pray.

1104
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:32,551
Lord, thank you for the
food we're about to receive,

1105
00:52:32,586 --> 00:52:33,965
in Jesus's name, amen.

1106
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,551
- Amen.
- Amen.

1107
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:36,620
So, uh...

1108
00:52:37,586 --> 00:52:39,206
Dig in.

1109
00:52:43,862 --> 00:52:45,458
- All right, come on, come on.
- What's the surprise?

1110
00:52:45,482 --> 00:52:47,206
No, keep coming, keep
coming, keep coming!

1111
00:52:47,241 --> 00:52:48,586
- You'll see!
- You'll see!

1112
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:49,758
Right there, right there!

1113
00:52:49,793 --> 00:52:50,758
Okay, you'll see

1114
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:52,206
in 5... 4...

1115
00:52:52,241 --> 00:52:53,310
3... 2... 1...

1116
00:52:53,344 --> 00:52:54,586
go!

1117
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,448
Now that's Christmas
right there!

1118
00:52:56,482 --> 00:52:57,896
Take it all in, Liz!

1119
00:52:57,931 --> 00:52:59,724
Surprise!

1120
00:52:59,758 --> 00:53:01,965
- You like that, don't you?
- Okay!

1121
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,896
I know exactly what I
want Santa to leave me

1122
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:07,344
- under this tree!
- What's that, baby girl?

1123
00:53:07,379 --> 00:53:08,965
More than anything,

1124
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,620
I want Santa to bring me
a doll that looks like me!

1125
00:53:12,655 --> 00:53:14,034
Oh, cool!

1126
00:53:14,068 --> 00:53:16,379
I know you into this
Christmas spirit.

1127
00:53:16,413 --> 00:53:17,689
Right, right.

1128
00:53:17,724 --> 00:53:19,620
Only thing we need now.

1129
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,034
Who's that singing?

1130
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:26,275
That's Mommy.

1131
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:27,827
Mommy, come back!

1132
00:53:30,551 --> 00:53:31,827
- Come on!
- Okay.

1133
00:53:31,862 --> 00:53:35,379
Mommy, your voice,
it's everything!

1134
00:53:35,413 --> 00:53:36,758
Well, thank you, sweetheart!

1135
00:53:36,793 --> 00:53:38,758
Hey, help me finish the tree.

1136
00:53:38,793 --> 00:53:40,275
Okay, okay.

1137
00:53:47,068 --> 00:53:48,517
Nicky, Nicky!

1138
00:53:48,551 --> 00:53:49,931
Nicky!

1139
00:53:49,965 --> 00:53:51,355
What is it with the
women around here

1140
00:53:51,379 --> 00:53:53,275
to keep waking me up?

1141
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:54,793
What is it?

1142
00:53:54,827 --> 00:53:55,793
Wake up!

1143
00:53:55,827 --> 00:53:58,793
Oh, this is about me
playing the music, right?

1144
00:53:58,827 --> 00:53:59,931
Yes.

1145
00:53:59,965 --> 00:54:01,413
Why did you do that?

1146
00:54:03,068 --> 00:54:04,620
Look, I don't,

1147
00:54:04,655 --> 00:54:06,931
I don't want you to keep
letting my past mistakes

1148
00:54:06,965 --> 00:54:09,551
keep you from singing.

1149
00:54:09,586 --> 00:54:13,517
If you never sing again, you'll
always be a star in my eye.

1150
00:54:13,551 --> 00:54:14,931
That's the thing, Nicky.

1151
00:54:14,965 --> 00:54:19,551
You see potential in
everything and everybody else,

1152
00:54:19,586 --> 00:54:21,000
but not yourself.

1153
00:54:21,034 --> 00:54:22,793
It's the way I was raised.

1154
00:54:22,827 --> 00:54:26,034
My daddy didn't see me as
a son, he saw me as a con.

1155
00:54:27,793 --> 00:54:30,517
A kid with my skills, we
swindled our way through Jersey

1156
00:54:30,551 --> 00:54:33,517
like a hot knife through butter.

1157
00:54:33,551 --> 00:54:36,034
There was a price to pay.

1158
00:54:36,068 --> 00:54:37,862
My childhood.

1159
00:54:37,896 --> 00:54:41,827
It's always been off limits
talking about your dad.

1160
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:43,448
What changed?

1161
00:54:43,482 --> 00:54:44,620
Being Santa.

1162
00:54:44,655 --> 00:54:47,344
It brought back
so many memories.

1163
00:54:47,379 --> 00:54:49,000
You know, we had
our biggest score

1164
00:54:49,034 --> 00:54:51,034
during the holiday season.

1165
00:54:51,068 --> 00:54:54,758
My dad say, "Christmas is
the biggest con of all."

1166
00:54:54,793 --> 00:54:56,034
We were so busy hustling

1167
00:54:56,068 --> 00:54:58,862
that we never
celebrated the holidays.

1168
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:00,448
Then my mom, on the other hand,

1169
00:55:00,482 --> 00:55:03,620
she, she really wanted
something different for me.

1170
00:55:03,655 --> 00:55:07,413
I tried so hard not
to be like that man.

1171
00:55:10,931 --> 00:55:12,448
But here I am.

1172
00:55:12,482 --> 00:55:14,586
You're not like him.

1173
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:16,103
You a dreamer.

1174
00:55:17,172 --> 00:55:19,379
Not a schemer.

1175
00:55:19,413 --> 00:55:23,068
Then why do I feel like
I've, I've lost so much

1176
00:55:23,103 --> 00:55:26,103
of myself along the way?

1177
00:55:26,137 --> 00:55:28,586
I just feel like I've lost me.

1178
00:55:45,034 --> 00:55:46,896
Say, dude, watch
where you going!

1179
00:55:46,931 --> 00:55:50,068
Ay, man, you got tissue every...

1180
00:55:50,103 --> 00:55:51,793
Nevermind.

1181
00:55:54,793 --> 00:55:56,620
I can't believe this!

1182
00:55:59,068 --> 00:56:01,000
Who would?

1183
00:56:01,034 --> 00:56:04,000
Huh, I think I seen who did
this, but he's gone now!

1184
00:56:04,034 --> 00:56:06,482
You think you can give a
description to mall security?

1185
00:56:06,517 --> 00:56:08,482
- Yes.
- Great!

1186
00:56:08,517 --> 00:56:10,724
You know, I don't
believe in coincidence.

1187
00:56:10,758 --> 00:56:12,482
Think someone's
trying to get us.

1188
00:56:12,517 --> 00:56:14,034
Yeah, I agree.

1189
00:56:14,068 --> 00:56:16,655
- Come on, Liz, I got an idea.
- Okay.

1190
00:56:16,689 --> 00:56:19,689
Well, you help Santa, okay?

1191
00:56:19,724 --> 00:56:22,448
Mr. Fairchild, look, we'll
have this place cleaned up

1192
00:56:22,482 --> 00:56:25,482
so fresh and so clean,
just like my Santa suit.

1193
00:56:25,517 --> 00:56:27,034
- Bless you, Santa.
- Mm-hmm.

1194
00:56:27,068 --> 00:56:30,137
How do you keep your Santa
suit so fresh and clean?

1195
00:56:30,172 --> 00:56:32,689
Oh, I only take my clothes
to Jefferson Cleaners.

1196
00:56:32,724 --> 00:56:34,862
Ran by George and
Weezy Jefferson.

1197
00:56:34,896 --> 00:56:36,103
Must make a note of that.

1198
00:56:36,137 --> 00:56:37,758
George and Weezy.

1199
00:56:37,793 --> 00:56:38,976
How do you spell Weezy? Two Es?

1200
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,689
- Two Es, yes.
- Weezy.

1201
00:56:43,862 --> 00:56:46,137
You know, Santa's
on the marquee.

1202
00:56:46,172 --> 00:56:48,482
The spotlight needs to be on me.

1203
00:56:48,517 --> 00:56:50,206
But if you put Santa on blast,

1204
00:56:50,241 --> 00:56:53,000
it might get you
spotted by the mob.

1205
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:55,586
Yeah, but I've tried the
suburban Santa stuff.

1206
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,827
That's not working for me.

1207
00:56:56,862 --> 00:56:59,000
My soul's just not in it.

1208
00:56:59,034 --> 00:57:03,034
If I'm gonna do this,
I need to do it my way.

1209
00:57:03,068 --> 00:57:04,103
Santa...

1210
00:57:04,137 --> 00:57:06,586
- needs some...
- soul!

1211
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,103
♪ Hit it

1212
00:57:08,137 --> 00:57:10,620
Go, Santa! Go, Santa!

1213
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,862
Go, Santa!

1214
00:57:11,896 --> 00:57:13,068
Ay!

1215
00:57:13,103 --> 00:57:14,172
Go, Santa!

1216
00:57:14,206 --> 00:57:15,896
Go, go, go, go!

1217
00:57:16,862 --> 00:57:18,206
Come one, come all!

1218
00:57:18,241 --> 00:57:21,034
See the greatest show
in the North Pole!

1219
00:57:21,068 --> 00:57:24,068
Santa's Village
reopens in 24 hours!

1220
00:57:24,103 --> 00:57:25,103
Come see me!

1221
00:57:33,068 --> 00:57:36,034
Nicky, this is not a nightclub!

1222
00:57:36,068 --> 00:57:38,793
I mean, we can't take
vandalism and you.

1223
00:57:38,827 --> 00:57:40,551
Okay, well, uh...

1224
00:57:40,586 --> 00:57:44,655
About that impromptu
Santa show I just saw

1225
00:57:44,689 --> 00:57:45,793
on the monitors.

1226
00:57:45,827 --> 00:57:47,241
Sir, let me explain.

1227
00:57:47,275 --> 00:57:49,862
Yes, please explain
the exciting surprise.

1228
00:57:49,896 --> 00:57:51,034
What?

1229
00:57:51,068 --> 00:57:53,586
It was a jolt!

1230
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:56,551
And a great distraction
from the vandalism!

1231
00:57:56,586 --> 00:57:58,103
And it was all Liz's idea.

1232
00:57:58,137 --> 00:58:00,827
Oh, well, with ideas like that,

1233
00:58:00,862 --> 00:58:02,103
you will be getting a promotion

1234
00:58:02,137 --> 00:58:05,241
as long as the
mall stays afloat.

1235
00:58:05,275 --> 00:58:07,034
I don't know what to say.

1236
00:58:07,068 --> 00:58:08,689
Oh, Liz is being modest.

1237
00:58:08,724 --> 00:58:11,000
She already had a plan to
revamp Santa's Village,

1238
00:58:11,034 --> 00:58:13,034
making it the hippest
trip in America.

1239
00:58:15,137 --> 00:58:19,275
Bravo! To you both, but, you,
where did you get those moves?

1240
00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:20,830
Oh, I learned the
dance from my homies,

1241
00:58:20,862 --> 00:58:23,241
Raj, Rerun, Dwayne,
and The Fly Girls.

1242
00:58:23,275 --> 00:58:25,137
"What's Happening"
is when I dance,

1243
00:58:25,172 --> 00:58:27,344
it's all in "Living Color".

1244
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:30,068
You are such a

1245
00:58:30,103 --> 00:58:31,793
visual artist!

1246
00:58:31,827 --> 00:58:33,793
- Well, that I am!
- Hmm!

1247
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:40,137
♪ Uh

1248
00:58:40,172 --> 00:58:41,620

1255
00:58:52,206 --> 00:58:56,034
What does Firefly Enterprise
have that we don't have?

1256
00:58:56,068 --> 00:58:57,655
A dope ass mall.

1257
00:58:58,689 --> 00:59:00,724
But we have dope people.

1258
00:59:00,758 --> 00:59:03,620
We have a goldmine right here!

1259
00:59:05,448 --> 00:59:08,103
Pickings look slim to me, Santa.

1260
00:59:08,137 --> 00:59:10,724
Well, it's not about pizzazz.

1261
00:59:10,758 --> 00:59:14,172
Instead of having everybody
just sit on Santa's lap,

1262
00:59:14,206 --> 00:59:17,758
I say we get everybody
involved in on the action.

1263
00:59:17,793 --> 00:59:22,793
I'm gonna do Santa like I seen
growing up as a little boy.

1264
00:59:22,827 --> 00:59:25,413
I'm gonna be Soul Santa!

1265
00:59:25,448 --> 00:59:26,931
Soul Santa?

1266
00:59:26,965 --> 00:59:28,758
That's a whole mood!

1267
00:59:28,793 --> 00:59:31,241
It will be as soon as Erix
shares his musical talents

1268
00:59:31,275 --> 00:59:32,793
with us.

1269
00:59:32,827 --> 00:59:35,103
What are you talking about,
Santa?

1270
00:59:35,137 --> 00:59:37,172
You play an instrument.

1271
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:40,241
How could you
possibly know that?

1272
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:43,241
'Cause I'm Santa.

1273
00:59:51,034 --> 00:59:52,310
Come on!

1274
00:59:52,344 --> 00:59:55,862
I demand an explanation!

1275
00:59:55,896 --> 00:59:59,862
I did not approve my
son as a Santa's helper!

1276
01:00:02,275 --> 01:00:04,931
What? Oh, wait a minute!

1277
01:00:04,965 --> 01:00:06,862
What... Are y'all seeing this?

1278
01:00:06,896 --> 01:00:09,655
Are, are you seeing this?

1279
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:11,689
Yes!

1280
01:00:11,724 --> 01:00:14,172
Oh, my... You, you don't see it?

1281
01:00:14,206 --> 01:00:18,034
You are absolutely perfect!

1282
01:00:18,068 --> 01:00:21,931
Yas! Hunty, yas-uh!

1283
01:00:21,965 --> 01:00:24,310
You are so quiche!

1284
01:00:24,344 --> 01:00:26,068
I am?

1285
01:00:26,103 --> 01:00:27,172
Yes!

1286
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:29,310
I mean, yes!

1287
01:00:29,344 --> 01:00:31,034
I know!

1288
01:00:31,068 --> 01:00:32,724
And we would be honored

1289
01:00:32,758 --> 01:00:34,793
if you would share your
impeccable style with us.

1290
01:00:36,793 --> 01:00:37,896
Tell me more!

1291
01:00:37,931 --> 01:00:39,137
Need I say more?

1292
01:00:39,172 --> 01:00:43,034
S-spin, let me see the spin.

1293
01:00:45,724 --> 01:00:47,068
Ho-ho-ho!

1294
01:00:47,103 --> 01:00:48,172
Yes!

1295
01:00:48,206 --> 01:00:50,862
Let the glitter... Oh, ho-ho!

1296
01:00:53,724 --> 01:00:55,965
Welcome!

1297
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,275
Yes, it's true!

1298
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:00,965
Of all the people
in this mall...

1299
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,482
Hey, Brenda!

1300
01:01:02,517 --> 01:01:04,758
I was chosen

1301
01:01:04,793 --> 01:01:06,413
to welcome you!

1302
01:01:06,448 --> 01:01:10,172
Now, New York may
have the Met Gala,

1303
01:01:10,206 --> 01:01:14,379
but the Sunshine
Mall has the all-new

1304
01:01:14,413 --> 01:01:17,275
Santa's Village!

1305
01:01:19,068 --> 01:01:20,413
All right, party people!

1306
01:01:20,448 --> 01:01:23,068
Who's ready to get
their Christmas on?

1307
01:01:25,413 --> 01:01:28,103
Okay, Santa! Come
all the way through!

1308
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,793
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

1309
01:01:32,448 --> 01:01:35,965
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

1310
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,241
I'm about to put some soul
into Soul Santa's Village!

1311
01:01:39,275 --> 01:01:40,862
Yes, boy!

1312
01:01:40,896 --> 01:01:44,275
Uh, low-key, high-key, this
audience is light as a mother.

1313
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:46,137
Uh, y-y-you think more
people are coming?

1314
01:01:46,172 --> 01:01:48,931
If I built it, they will come.

1315
01:01:48,965 --> 01:01:50,034
Watch me party.

1316
01:01:50,068 --> 01:01:51,862
Step back and watch me work!

1317
01:01:51,896 --> 01:01:54,034
♪ Uh, when I say
Santa, you say Claus ♪

1318
01:01:54,068 --> 01:01:55,103
- ♪ Santa!

1319
01:01:55,137 --> 01:01:58,068
- ♪ Santa!

1320
01:01:58,103 --> 01:01:59,827
- Okay.
- Claus!

1321
01:01:59,862 --> 01:02:02,241
It's obvious we have a little
learning curve here, okay?

1322
01:02:02,275 --> 01:02:06,206
So, these are the rules
for the new Santa Village.

1323
01:02:06,241 --> 01:02:09,896
There will be no
wallflowers, you got it?

1324
01:02:09,931 --> 01:02:11,517
No wallflowers!

1325
01:02:11,551 --> 01:02:14,172
Now take a deep breath,
leave your egos at the door,

1326
01:02:14,206 --> 01:02:15,310
let your hair down.

1327
01:02:15,344 --> 01:02:17,034
So are you ready to party?

1328
01:02:18,482 --> 01:02:21,344

Yeah, boy!

1341
01:02:43,827 --> 01:02:47,034
Okay, why does Santa
need an umbrella?

1342
01:02:47,068 --> 01:02:49,000
For the rain, dear!

1343
01:02:52,344 --> 01:02:53,551
Yeah!

1344
01:02:53,586 --> 01:02:55,310
Pass me my knife,
'cause I'm cutting 'em!

1345
01:02:55,344 --> 01:02:56,448
Yes, Lord, I'm cutting 'em.

1346
01:02:56,482 --> 01:02:59,034
And Joker, nobody
can beat that one!

1347
01:02:59,068 --> 01:03:01,413
Nobody can beat...

1348
01:03:01,448 --> 01:03:04,241
And, uh, on you! I got fire
in these hands, baby, fire!

1349
01:03:04,275 --> 01:03:07,275
But what card do I have...

1350
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:08,275
Santa?

1351
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:12,068
Ah!

1352
01:03:13,344 --> 01:03:15,034
No, w-we'll work on that.

1353
01:03:15,068 --> 01:03:16,348
Throw the bones, throw the bone!

1354
01:03:17,965 --> 01:03:21,034
Fried chicken and cornbread
keep a poor man fed.

1355
01:03:21,068 --> 01:03:23,241
Yeah.

1356
01:03:23,275 --> 01:03:25,241
G-good job on that
revamp, Santa.

1357
01:03:25,275 --> 01:03:26,620
Yeah.

1358
01:03:26,655 --> 01:03:28,965
Daddy shoots outtie, uh!

1359
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,344
Ooh, okay, okay!

1360
01:03:30,379 --> 01:03:32,206
Nice, but no seriously, though.

1361
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:33,596
You really came
through this season.

1362
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:37,034
You may have saved the
mall, my job, and...

1363
01:03:37,068 --> 01:03:39,206
Liz's.

1364
01:03:39,241 --> 01:03:40,586
I better pay attention.

1365
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:42,586
You know, miracles
happen at Christmas.

1366
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:44,620
You know, it's funny you
should say that, Santa.

1367
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:47,551
'Cause I think I found
a miracle in Liz.

1368
01:03:47,586 --> 01:03:49,275
She's a great one.

1369
01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:51,034
Everything I ever ask for.

1370
01:03:51,068 --> 01:03:52,241
Uh, boat 'em!

1371
01:03:52,275 --> 01:03:54,275
Okay!

1372
01:03:54,310 --> 01:03:57,103
Oh!

1373
01:03:57,137 --> 01:03:59,482
And Nevaeh?

1374
01:03:59,517 --> 01:04:02,206
She is the sweetest
kid, I swear.

1375
01:04:02,241 --> 01:04:05,137
Ooh!

1376
01:04:06,586 --> 01:04:09,137
I think I found my family,
though, Santa.

1377
01:04:09,172 --> 01:04:10,482
They're amazing.

1378
01:04:10,517 --> 01:04:12,448
And her ex?

1379
01:04:12,482 --> 01:04:16,517
Some kind of degenerate,
gambling low-life, I don't know.

1380
01:04:16,551 --> 01:04:18,965
Somewhere in her heart, I think
she's holding out for him,

1381
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,931
but her mind knows better.

1382
01:04:20,965 --> 01:04:24,275
Three piece. Hold the biscuit.

1383
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:26,034
It's an earthquake!

1384
01:04:26,068 --> 01:04:27,965
Domino!

1385
01:04:30,137 --> 01:04:34,172
Hey! Better luck next time!

1386
01:04:54,103 --> 01:04:56,655
That's my son!

1387
01:04:56,689 --> 01:04:59,103
Put some stank on it, son,
put some stank on it.

1388
01:05:03,586 --> 01:05:05,413
- Great job!
- Oh!

1389
01:05:05,448 --> 01:05:08,379
- Sure, sure.
- Yeah, sure!

1390
01:05:08,413 --> 01:05:09,689
- Yeah!
- Thank you!

1391
01:05:09,724 --> 01:05:11,103
Merry Christmas!

1392
01:05:11,137 --> 01:05:12,275
- Merry Christmas!
- Bye!

1393
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:13,448
Thank you, Soul Santa!

1394
01:05:13,482 --> 01:05:16,068
Thank you, soul brother!

1395
01:05:16,103 --> 01:05:17,689
Um...

1396
01:05:17,724 --> 01:05:21,379
You haven't won me
over yet, Santa,

1397
01:05:21,413 --> 01:05:26,241
but this is a moral victory.

1398
01:05:30,241 --> 01:05:32,413
- We won her over.
- Yup!

1399
01:05:32,448 --> 01:05:35,379
You're Santa now, really Santa.

1400
01:05:37,689 --> 01:05:39,206
Sure, sure!

1401
01:05:42,758 --> 01:05:44,551
Ay, yo! Come here!

1402
01:05:44,586 --> 01:05:46,172
You gotta look at this,
it's hilarious!

1403
01:05:46,206 --> 01:05:50,068
Look at that!

1404
01:05:51,206 --> 01:05:53,172
Enough fun and games.

1405
01:05:53,206 --> 01:05:55,068
Raise the hit on Nicky to 40k.

1406
01:05:55,103 --> 01:05:59,172
Yeah.

1407
01:06:21,448 --> 01:06:23,655
Uh...

1408
01:06:23,689 --> 01:06:26,137
What is this called?

1409
01:06:26,172 --> 01:06:28,344
It's a grounding technique.

1410
01:06:28,379 --> 01:06:30,482
Focusing on the here and now.

1411
01:06:30,517 --> 01:06:32,655
Okay.

1412
01:06:32,689 --> 01:06:35,655
Can we talk about
the here and now?

1413
01:06:35,689 --> 01:06:38,620
Grounding works best in silence,

1414
01:06:40,275 --> 01:06:43,068
but words can't be therapeutic.

1415
01:06:45,172 --> 01:06:46,793
Uh...

1416
01:06:46,827 --> 01:06:50,103
Being here has
brought back feelings.

1417
01:06:50,137 --> 01:06:52,310
Inhale.

1418
01:06:52,344 --> 01:06:54,758
Exhale.

1419
01:06:54,793 --> 01:07:00,206
Breathe through it.

1420
01:07:00,241 --> 01:07:03,862
It's, it's brought back
feelings for me that I thought...

1421
01:07:03,896 --> 01:07:06,482
Self-soothe, be aware.

1422
01:07:06,517 --> 01:07:08,689
Speak truth.

1423
01:07:10,655 --> 01:07:14,344
Well, that ends the session.

1424
01:07:14,379 --> 01:07:17,551
Gotta get ready to meet Conrad.

1425
01:07:17,586 --> 01:07:19,137
Conrad?

1426
01:07:19,172 --> 01:07:21,206
Yeah, we're going to dinner.

1427
01:07:23,413 --> 01:07:25,310
As the young people say now,

1428
01:07:25,344 --> 01:07:27,655
we're Instagram official!

1429
01:07:31,206 --> 01:07:34,172
This about a... Conrad.

1430
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:39,310
It's okay, Daddy. Don't give up.

1431
01:08:25,586 --> 01:08:28,241
- Stop lying on Conrad!
- Lying?

1432
01:08:28,275 --> 01:08:31,793
I seen old boy booed up, booed
up with the cosmetic chick.

1433
01:08:31,827 --> 01:08:34,206
Nicky, stop throwing
shade on my joy!

1434
01:08:34,241 --> 01:08:36,724
What?

1435
01:08:36,758 --> 01:08:39,206
Oh, man!

1436
01:08:43,275 --> 01:08:46,896
I do not act like my mother!

1437
01:08:47,931 --> 01:08:50,379
That hurt my feelings.

1438
01:08:50,827 --> 01:08:52,206
You...

1439
01:08:52,241 --> 01:08:54,931
You're patronizing me!

1440
01:08:54,965 --> 01:08:57,965
You're right, I am trying
to work on my weight

1441
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,965
and smile more!

1442
01:09:03,448 --> 01:09:07,551
I am here looking for something
pretty to wear for you!

1443
01:09:11,793 --> 01:09:13,896
Was that hubby?

1444
01:09:13,931 --> 01:09:18,310
What's it to you?

1445
01:09:19,344 --> 01:09:21,586
Mind if I offer my two cents?

1446
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:22,896
No.

1447
01:09:26,310 --> 01:09:27,620
What?

1448
01:09:29,517 --> 01:09:31,448
What is it?

1449
01:09:31,482 --> 01:09:35,620
It seems as if hubby treats
you like a possession.

1450
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:38,000
So to balance it all,

1451
01:09:38,034 --> 01:09:40,965
you come to the mall and
buy all these things.

1452
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,586
But you're not gonna
find what you need.

1453
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:47,034
Which is?

1454
01:09:47,068 --> 01:09:49,793
I don't know,
that's for you to answer.

1455
01:09:49,827 --> 01:09:52,655
But it is something
that money can't buy.

1456
01:10:01,413 --> 01:10:02,655
Well...

1457
01:10:17,068 --> 01:10:20,448
Hey, hey, Phil.

1458
01:10:22,448 --> 01:10:25,275
Look what I did.

1459
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:26,965
I told you, I'm a stable genius.

1460
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,862
Get it?

1461
01:10:28,896 --> 01:10:31,034
Just wheel him in.

1462
01:10:31,068 --> 01:10:33,517
Good job!

1463
01:10:34,724 --> 01:10:38,862
We have had some
unsettling news.

1464
01:10:38,896 --> 01:10:40,793
An unknown source has revealed

1465
01:10:40,827 --> 01:10:45,344
that you have been giving
our workers con job training.

1466
01:10:46,068 --> 01:10:48,689
Et tu, Santa?

1467
01:10:48,724 --> 01:10:50,344
Say it isn't so.

1468
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:51,931
This is a con-spiracy.

1469
01:10:51,965 --> 01:10:54,275
Did I impart wisdom
into the staff?

1470
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:55,862
Yes!

1471
01:10:55,896 --> 01:10:58,586
Have you seen an increase
in sales due to it?

1472
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:00,344
Yes!

1473
01:11:00,379 --> 01:11:01,827
Enough said.

1474
01:11:01,862 --> 01:11:03,413
Uh, he's right.

1475
01:11:03,448 --> 01:11:06,034
Uh, sales are well, and the
products are legitimate,

1476
01:11:06,068 --> 01:11:08,344
so marketing could be creative.

1477
01:11:08,379 --> 01:11:10,517
I am not comfortable with this!

1478
01:11:10,551 --> 01:11:12,551
If it gets out,

1479
01:11:12,586 --> 01:11:16,034
we could be flagged by the
Better Business Bureau. Or worse.

1480
01:11:16,068 --> 01:11:19,931
But we are so close
to breaking even!

1481
01:11:19,965 --> 01:11:24,034
Just no more cons!

1482
01:11:24,068 --> 01:11:25,448
Right?

1483
01:11:26,793 --> 01:11:27,827
No.

1484
01:11:27,862 --> 01:11:31,034
- No?
- Right.

1485
01:11:32,379 --> 01:11:33,655
Yes.

1486
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:35,758
- No.
- No meaning yes.

1487
01:11:35,793 --> 01:11:37,044
- All right.
- In a positive way.

1488
01:11:37,068 --> 01:11:39,517
- Good.
- Yes, no.

1489
01:11:41,379 --> 01:11:42,758
What were you thinking?

1490
01:11:42,793 --> 01:11:45,034
Conning at my place of business?

1491
01:11:45,068 --> 01:11:46,724
Well, I was thinking about you.

1492
01:11:46,758 --> 01:11:48,344
- Me?
- Yes, you!

1493
01:11:48,379 --> 01:11:51,724
Thinking about your job,
thinking about this mall!

1494
01:11:51,758 --> 01:11:55,758
I would do anything for
you because I love you.

1495
01:11:55,793 --> 01:11:57,827
That's what I was trying to say.

1496
01:11:57,862 --> 01:11:59,931
Nicky,

1497
01:11:59,965 --> 01:12:02,034
I will always care about you.

1498
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:03,551
I didn't say care.
I said, I love...

1499
01:12:03,586 --> 01:12:04,896
No, Nicky!

1500
01:12:04,931 --> 01:12:08,000
Cannot go down this road again.

1501
01:12:10,103 --> 01:12:13,344
It's just best
that we be friends.

1502
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,068
- Friends?
- Yes.

1503
01:12:17,103 --> 01:12:19,689
Well, I don't wanna be friends.

1504
01:12:20,793 --> 01:12:24,413
Yeah, I'll get that back to you.

1505
01:12:24,448 --> 01:12:25,827
Everything okay out here?

1506
01:12:25,862 --> 01:12:27,068
It's fine.

1507
01:12:27,103 --> 01:12:28,758
Yeah, we good.

1508
01:12:28,793 --> 01:12:32,344
Just having a conversation
with my friend.

1509
01:13:07,896 --> 01:13:08,965
Oh, dear.

1510
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,758
You never look so worrisome.

1511
01:13:10,793 --> 01:13:13,655
What, was it the coup
d'etat in my office?

1512
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:16,137
No, I just got a lot on my mind.

1513
01:13:16,172 --> 01:13:18,827
You need an outlet.

1514
01:13:18,862 --> 01:13:22,068
What do you do for fun?

1515
01:13:22,103 --> 01:13:26,034
I usually cleanse myself in
the waters of Lake Minnetonka.

1516
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:27,931
Oh.

1517
01:13:27,965 --> 01:13:29,551
Well that sounds
so fun, so fine.

1518
01:13:31,034 --> 01:13:34,206
You ever feel like
you've missed your shot?

1519
01:13:34,241 --> 01:13:37,689
All the time.

1520
01:13:37,724 --> 01:13:41,000
Like with our
Christmas marketing,

1521
01:13:41,034 --> 01:13:43,655
we're doing good, but
we're missing something

1522
01:13:43,689 --> 01:13:45,137
to tip the scale.

1523
01:13:45,172 --> 01:13:47,172
The revamp Santa's Village
is doing wonderful!

1524
01:13:47,206 --> 01:13:49,655
It's growing bigger
and bigger every day.

1525
01:13:49,689 --> 01:13:51,655
What you need to
do on Christmas Eve

1526
01:13:51,689 --> 01:13:54,103
is throw a huge party!

1527
01:13:54,137 --> 01:13:55,827
Big party!

1528
01:13:55,862 --> 01:13:57,689
That will give you the
audience that you need.

1529
01:13:57,724 --> 01:13:59,862
Christmas Eve is
three days away.

1530
01:13:59,896 --> 01:14:01,241
Oh, that's plenty of time.

1531
01:14:01,275 --> 01:14:04,034
It'll be Santa's
Village on steroids!

1532
01:14:04,068 --> 01:14:06,275
- Really?
- Yes!

1533
01:14:13,827 --> 01:14:16,034
This tree is gonna be so pretty!

1534
01:14:16,068 --> 01:14:18,620
So pretty!

1535
01:14:19,689 --> 01:14:22,965
Christmas Eve experience.

1536
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,103
So you want to pimp the
house out, Christmas style?

1537
01:14:26,137 --> 01:14:27,620
It's my turn.

1538
01:14:27,655 --> 01:14:29,551
Go, go ahead.

1539
01:14:29,586 --> 01:14:30,596
- Come on, Daddy!
- Come on, Nicky!

1540
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:31,931
Join the fun!

1541
01:14:31,965 --> 01:14:33,620
We could do it together.

1542
01:14:33,655 --> 01:14:35,758
Okay.

1543
01:14:35,793 --> 01:14:37,896
Christmas Eve experience.

1544
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:39,275
Just grab something
outta the box.

1545
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:40,620
Okay.

1546
01:14:40,655 --> 01:14:41,862
I'll get a...

1547
01:14:41,896 --> 01:14:42,896
What if I do a bow?

1548
01:14:42,931 --> 01:14:44,586
Yes, that sounds good!

1549
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:47,068
I'ma put it right in
the center right there.

1550
01:14:47,103 --> 01:14:48,551
Bam!

1551
01:14:48,586 --> 01:14:50,137
Look at that!

1552
01:14:50,172 --> 01:14:53,655
The Christmas Eve event
is going to be a blowout!

1553
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:55,241
So please, check your inboxes

1554
01:14:55,275 --> 01:14:58,206
because we're integrating all
of your products and services

1555
01:14:58,241 --> 01:15:00,275
into the event that night.
Isn't that wonderful?

1556
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:02,103
Yeah, I know it is.

1557
01:15:02,137 --> 01:15:03,965
I know it is.

1558
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,355
And everything that
the customers will see

1559
01:15:05,379 --> 01:15:07,010
when they come in is
going to be for sale.

1560
01:15:07,034 --> 01:15:08,103
So...

1561
01:15:08,137 --> 01:15:12,137
Conrad is my man, not yours.

1562
01:15:12,172 --> 01:15:15,620
What?

1563
01:15:15,655 --> 01:15:18,310
Here he is!

1564
01:15:18,344 --> 01:15:23,724
In my bed after we've taken
real good care of each other.

1565
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,862
But the trees and
all the good stuff.

1566
01:15:28,896 --> 01:15:31,103
So we'll have trees and you
can have your fragrances.

1567
01:15:31,137 --> 01:15:32,965
- Mm-hmm!
- And, you know,

1568
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,068
all your lingerie
line and everything.

1569
01:15:35,103 --> 01:15:37,965
Hey!

1570
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,586
The makeup counter lady

1571
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:41,113
with the bad lace front
just bumrushed Liz!

1572
01:15:41,137 --> 01:15:43,103
What?

1573
01:15:43,137 --> 01:15:44,689
I'll be back.

1574
01:15:44,724 --> 01:15:45,793
Excuse me.

1575
01:15:57,965 --> 01:15:59,620
- Conrad!
- What's up?

1576
01:15:59,655 --> 01:16:01,793
Your chick, Tiffany in
cosmetics, just approached me

1577
01:16:01,827 --> 01:16:03,310
and said you slept with her!

1578
01:16:03,344 --> 01:16:04,896
Come on, Liz, you
know that's not true.

1579
01:16:04,931 --> 01:16:06,896
Don't lie, Conrad!

1580
01:16:06,931 --> 01:16:09,689
She just showed me pictures of
you in the throes of it all.

1581
01:16:09,724 --> 01:16:10,862
- So?
- So?

1582
01:16:10,896 --> 01:16:12,827
Listen, I don't do drama, okay?

1583
01:16:12,862 --> 01:16:15,068
So if you want to be with me,
you better act like it!

1584
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:16,206
Man,

1585
01:16:16,241 --> 01:16:18,034
I ain't got to deal with this...

1586
01:16:18,068 --> 01:16:19,148
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- You better get your hands off of me!

1587
01:16:19,172 --> 01:16:20,931
Listen, you don't
walk away from...

1588
01:16:20,965 --> 01:16:22,344
- Hey!
- Would you let me go?

1589
01:16:24,068 --> 01:16:25,862
Did I do that?

1590
01:16:29,103 --> 01:16:30,793
Oh, dear!

1591
01:16:31,896 --> 01:16:34,068
You saw what he did! He hit me!

1592
01:16:34,103 --> 01:16:35,896
I'm going to HR,
he should be fired!

1593
01:16:35,931 --> 01:16:37,379
- And you?
- Me?

1594
01:16:37,413 --> 01:16:39,931
You were rough
with Liz, horrible!

1595
01:16:39,965 --> 01:16:42,034
And after today's drama,

1596
01:16:42,068 --> 01:16:44,896
several women have reported your
torrid relations around the mall!

1597
01:16:44,931 --> 01:16:48,034
E-e-everything that I've done
here has been consensual.

1598
01:16:48,068 --> 01:16:50,862
It will be an internal
investigation into all allegations.

1599
01:16:50,896 --> 01:16:52,034
Investigation?

1600
01:16:52,068 --> 01:16:54,724
That's right.

1601
01:17:20,482 --> 01:17:22,068
I'ma ask you one more time!

1602
01:17:22,103 --> 01:17:24,344
I told you, I don't
know a Conrad!

1603
01:17:24,379 --> 01:17:26,413
Stop lying, he gave
you an envelope!

1604
01:17:26,448 --> 01:17:29,000
I know he gave...

1605
01:17:33,068 --> 01:17:35,137
I'm keeping this.

1606
01:17:35,172 --> 01:17:36,827
I'm not saying another word.

1607
01:17:36,862 --> 01:17:37,931
Oh, you not?

1608
01:17:37,965 --> 01:17:39,827
Okay, okay, okay!

1609
01:17:39,862 --> 01:17:41,862
I'll tell you everything,
I'll tell you everything.

1610
01:18:25,068 --> 01:18:26,413
Yeah, no reward.

1611
01:18:26,448 --> 01:18:31,034
It's the wrong car.

1612
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,310
Hey!

1613
01:19:23,344 --> 01:19:25,206
Man, what you doing here?

1614
01:19:25,241 --> 01:19:27,034
Heard you talked to my
connect this morning.

1615
01:19:27,068 --> 01:19:30,000
You know something about me,
now I know something about you.

1616
01:19:30,034 --> 01:19:31,314
You don't know nothing about me.

1617
01:19:31,344 --> 01:19:33,310
Ah, you're the
deadbeat ex-husband.

1618
01:19:33,344 --> 01:19:36,931
My tech guy's got
your pictures, okay.

1619
01:19:38,137 --> 01:19:40,551
Nicky Cole.

1620
01:19:40,586 --> 01:19:42,586
Huh, you've been a naughty boy.

1621
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:44,448
Problems on both sides
of the law, I see.

1622
01:19:44,482 --> 01:19:48,000
And the mob's looking for you.

1623
01:19:48,034 --> 01:19:50,103
- Mm, mm, mm.
- I guess it's true.

1624
01:19:50,137 --> 01:19:54,103
The only kinda con can't
catch is another con.

1625
01:19:54,137 --> 01:19:55,241
What you want?

1626
01:19:55,275 --> 01:19:57,379
Not our mutual destruction.

1627
01:19:57,413 --> 01:19:58,896
And how do we prevent that?

1628
01:19:58,931 --> 01:20:03,379
Well, I don't call the mob,
and you help us out.

1629
01:20:04,103 --> 01:20:06,206
Help you how?

1630
01:20:06,241 --> 01:20:08,241
Firefly saw your
little Santa Claus seg.

1631
01:20:08,275 --> 01:20:09,620
They want you to
host their gala.

1632
01:20:09,655 --> 01:20:11,620
They're gonna broadcast
you around their malls

1633
01:20:11,655 --> 01:20:13,241
all across the country.

1634
01:20:13,275 --> 01:20:14,320
Okay, man, you know
that's the same night

1635
01:20:14,344 --> 01:20:15,931
as the Christmas Eve event.

1636
01:20:15,965 --> 01:20:18,137
If I don't show up,
it's gonna be a disaster.

1637
01:20:18,172 --> 01:20:20,551
Exactly.
And you can't warn anyone,

1638
01:20:20,586 --> 01:20:26,103
but the best part is we pay.

1639
01:20:28,103 --> 01:20:30,448
Nice to meet you, Nicky Cole.

1640
01:20:43,413 --> 01:20:45,586
I talked to Willie
at the stables.

1641
01:20:47,379 --> 01:20:49,965
He said he tipped
you off the day

1642
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,034
that Nicky lost all that money.

1643
01:20:53,068 --> 01:20:57,034
And he also said you're
Nicky's Jersey homeboy.

1644
01:20:59,034 --> 01:21:00,965
You got me, Paddy Kakes.

1645
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,482
Ah! Come on, man!

1646
01:21:06,517 --> 01:21:10,103
You lied last time!

1647
01:21:10,137 --> 01:21:12,103
It won't happen again!

1648
01:21:13,275 --> 01:21:16,551
Where's Nicky's daughter?

1649
01:21:16,586 --> 01:21:18,172
Kid's mom took her
to Hawaii, man!

1650
01:21:20,517 --> 01:21:21,620
No.

1651
01:21:21,655 --> 01:21:24,103
You're lying again!

1652
01:21:24,137 --> 01:21:25,620
So now,

1653
01:21:25,655 --> 01:21:29,137
I'm prescribing a
musculoskeletal basic procedure.

1654
01:21:29,172 --> 01:21:31,551
- No, man, no!
- Without anesthesia.

1655
01:21:45,103 --> 01:21:47,034
Oh, damn!

1656
01:21:55,068 --> 01:21:57,034
Stanford, Connecticut.

1657
01:21:57,068 --> 01:21:58,275
Don't do this, man.

1658
01:21:58,310 --> 01:22:00,103
Come on, Paddy Kakes.

1659
01:22:00,137 --> 01:22:03,689
Well, now I gotta make sure
you don't call anybody.

1660
01:22:03,724 --> 01:22:05,344
No, man! Come on,
don't do this, man!

1661
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:06,655
Come on!

1662
01:22:06,689 --> 01:22:08,586
Hurry up, Nicky,
and get dressed.

1663
01:22:08,620 --> 01:22:09,551
- We'll meet you there.
- Mm-hmm.

1664
01:22:09,586 --> 01:22:13,241
- Be on Santa time, not CP time.
- I hear you.

1665
01:22:13,275 --> 01:22:15,034
All right.

1666
01:22:15,068 --> 01:22:16,734
In my neighborhood, we
had a special tradition.

1667
01:22:16,758 --> 01:22:18,103
- Really?
- Yes!

1668
01:22:18,137 --> 01:22:19,724
We sure did!

1669
01:22:19,758 --> 01:22:22,655
We always gave the kids one gift
on Christmas Eve from Santa.

1670
01:22:22,689 --> 01:22:24,206
Can we do that tradition?

1671
01:22:24,241 --> 01:22:25,137
- Yes!
- Sure!

1672
01:22:25,172 --> 01:22:26,344
- Look!
- Gotcha!

1673
01:22:29,793 --> 01:22:33,034
Mommy, Daddy, look
what Santa brought me!

1674
01:22:33,068 --> 01:22:34,172
Just what I wanted!

1675
01:22:34,206 --> 01:22:36,034
Oh!

1676
01:22:36,068 --> 01:22:38,310
These fresh dolls are
positively perfect!

1677
01:22:38,344 --> 01:22:39,655
They look just like me!

1678
01:22:39,689 --> 01:22:42,413
- She does!
- Yeah!

1679
01:22:42,448 --> 01:22:44,275
Okay, you guys better get going.

1680
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:46,551
Okay.

1681
01:22:46,586 --> 01:22:48,689
We'll be waiting for
you at Santa's Village!

1682
01:22:48,724 --> 01:22:50,034
Okay, baby, lady.

1683
01:22:50,068 --> 01:22:51,172
Bye, Daddy!

1684
01:22:51,206 --> 01:22:52,379
- Bye-bye.
- Great job!

1685
01:22:52,413 --> 01:22:54,379
Oh!

1686
01:22:54,413 --> 01:22:55,517
- Okay.
- Bye!

1687
01:22:55,551 --> 01:22:57,172
- Bye-bye!
- Bye!

1688
01:22:57,206 --> 01:22:59,068
Can't wait!

1689
01:22:59,103 --> 01:23:01,413
Be careful!

1690
01:23:10,448 --> 01:23:14,068
Where's Santa? He's late.

1691
01:23:14,103 --> 01:23:16,172
Have you called your dad?

1692
01:23:16,206 --> 01:23:18,655
Keeps going to voicemail.

1693
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:35,689
A no-show Santa will be chaos!

1694
01:23:35,724 --> 01:23:37,482
I should've sold
this mall to Firefly!

1695
01:23:37,517 --> 01:23:40,344
They decreased their offer.

1696
01:23:40,379 --> 01:23:43,000
Before long, I'll be belly up!

1697
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:57,724
Uh, I made a mistake,
I put in the wrong address.

1698
01:23:57,758 --> 01:24:00,241
I don't need to go
to Firefly Mall.

1699
01:24:00,275 --> 01:24:04,551
Take me to Sunshine Mall,
step on it!

1700
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:19,482
Ho to the ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

1701
01:24:19,517 --> 01:24:20,551
I'm here, I'm here!

1702
01:24:20,586 --> 01:24:21,862
This is my husband, Bill,

1703
01:24:21,896 --> 01:24:24,586
and these are his
friends from work.

1704
01:24:24,620 --> 01:24:25,793
They came to see the show.

1705
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:27,827
These bags aren't mine.

1706
01:24:27,862 --> 01:24:31,137
We are buying gifts
for the needy.

1707
01:24:31,172 --> 01:24:34,827
Um, I, I don't usually,

1708
01:24:34,862 --> 01:24:36,344
um, eat crow,

1709
01:24:36,379 --> 01:24:38,862
but here goes.

1710
01:24:40,379 --> 01:24:43,482
I am so sorry

1711
01:24:43,517 --> 01:24:45,517
I judged you, Santa.

1712
01:24:46,551 --> 01:24:48,896
Thank you for saving my family.

1713
01:24:52,172 --> 01:24:53,413
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

1714
01:24:55,827 --> 01:24:58,310
I still don't believe
in Santa Claus,

1715
01:24:58,344 --> 01:25:00,206
but I do believe in you.

1716
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:03,551
Well, I got to get
this party started.

1717
01:25:03,586 --> 01:25:06,482
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

1718
01:25:06,517 --> 01:25:09,793
Let's get this
Santa party started!

1719
01:25:09,827 --> 01:25:10,413
Y'all ready?

1720
01:25:10,448 --> 01:25:12,724
Okay!

1721
01:25:12,758 --> 01:25:14,724
♪ When I say Christmas,
you say Eve ♪

1722
01:25:14,758 --> 01:25:15,896
- ♪ Christmas - Eve!

1723
01:25:15,931 --> 01:25:17,724
- ♪ Christmas - Eve!

1724
01:25:17,758 --> 01:25:19,241
- ♪ Christmas - Eve!

1725
01:25:19,275 --> 01:25:23,448
All right, all right!

1726
01:25:23,482 --> 01:25:24,931
Well, thank you all for coming.

1727
01:25:24,965 --> 01:25:26,827
It's Christmas Eve, of course.

1728
01:25:26,862 --> 01:25:29,379
And I want to let you
all know that tonight,

1729
01:25:29,413 --> 01:25:33,448
all of the stores in the mall
are gonna be open extra late,

1730
01:25:33,482 --> 01:25:35,206
just for you, okay?

1731
01:25:38,413 --> 01:25:42,379
So get ready for a
night full of surprises!

1732
01:25:42,413 --> 01:25:44,241
Are you ready for the surprises?

1733
01:25:45,896 --> 01:25:47,379
Yes!

1734
01:25:48,551 --> 01:25:51,448
Speaking of surprises,

1735
01:25:51,482 --> 01:25:54,413
I have one that's
going to be a doozy.

1736
01:25:54,448 --> 01:25:58,206
Santa is a fake.

1737
01:25:58,241 --> 01:26:01,448
He's a liar and a crook.

1738
01:26:01,482 --> 01:26:02,551
His real name

1739
01:26:03,517 --> 01:26:05,793
is Nicky Cole,

1740
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:10,862
ex-husband of Liz Cole.

1741
01:26:10,896 --> 01:26:12,827
Well, what are his crimes,
you ask?

1742
01:26:12,862 --> 01:26:17,551
Illegal gambling,
loansharking, racketeering,

1743
01:26:17,586 --> 01:26:18,931
and most importantly,

1744
01:26:18,965 --> 01:26:22,965
swindling each and
every one of you here.

1745
01:26:24,379 --> 01:26:27,310
Even his own wife and daughter.

1746
01:26:28,413 --> 01:26:31,517
He's a pathetic little conman.

1747
01:26:33,068 --> 01:26:34,827
Go ahead, Santa.

1748
01:26:34,862 --> 01:26:37,620
What do you have to
say for yourself?

1749
01:26:46,586 --> 01:26:50,620
Everything you said is true.

1750
01:26:50,655 --> 01:26:52,275
That's who I was,

1751
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:54,344
but that's not who I am anymore.

1752
01:26:56,344 --> 01:27:01,034
And I used to think Christmas
was the biggest con of all.

1753
01:27:01,068 --> 01:27:04,517
I seen Christmas through
all of your eyes.

1754
01:27:04,551 --> 01:27:08,551
I now see that a mall is
more than its stores.

1755
01:27:08,586 --> 01:27:11,517
It's relationships,
it's community.

1756
01:27:12,551 --> 01:27:14,379
I-it's not the building.

1757
01:27:14,413 --> 01:27:18,517
It's the people inside
that you connect with.

1758
01:27:18,551 --> 01:27:23,034
It's a place where you can,
you can come and find love.

1759
01:27:24,896 --> 01:27:27,586
Place where you can
come and find compassion

1760
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:29,379
and understanding.

1761
01:27:29,413 --> 01:27:33,344
It's a place where you can
find the meaning of life.

1762
01:27:35,965 --> 01:27:38,862
That's timeless, and the
person who's really trying

1763
01:27:38,896 --> 01:27:42,827
to destroy Sunshine
Mall is Conrad.

1764
01:27:42,862 --> 01:27:44,689
That's absurd!

1765
01:27:44,724 --> 01:27:47,758
No, it's not!

1766
01:27:47,793 --> 01:27:50,034
Conrad is helping
Firefly Enterprises

1767
01:27:50,068 --> 01:27:52,034
to sabotage the mall...

1768
01:27:52,068 --> 01:27:55,655
to force Fairchild to cave,
and sell this property to them!

1769
01:27:57,448 --> 01:27:59,896
Corporate spying is a...
It's a federal offense!

1770
01:27:59,931 --> 01:28:02,620
You and Firefly will be
hearing from our lawyers!

1771
01:28:02,655 --> 01:28:05,413
You're fired, get to stepping!
Get him out of our mall!

1772
01:28:05,448 --> 01:28:07,068
Got you! Let's go!

1773
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:09,448
Wait, what are you doing?

1774
01:28:09,482 --> 01:28:10,586
Give me that back!

1775
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:13,103
Get your hands off of me!

1776
01:28:13,137 --> 01:28:16,793
I'm Conrad Biles for God sake!

1777
01:28:16,827 --> 01:28:20,586
In a world that tries to
divide us by technology,

1778
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:22,931
it's good to know
that we have a place

1779
01:28:22,965 --> 01:28:26,103
that we can all still
come and gather.

1780
01:28:26,137 --> 01:28:28,068
This is my Christmas wish,

1781
01:28:28,103 --> 01:28:30,793
save Sunshine Mall!

1782
01:28:30,827 --> 01:28:33,034
Save Sunshine Mall!

1783
01:28:33,068 --> 01:28:35,068
Save Sunshine Mall!

1784
01:28:35,103 --> 01:28:37,482
Save Sunshine Mall!

1785
01:28:37,517 --> 01:28:39,482
Save Sunshine Mall!

1786
01:28:39,517 --> 01:28:41,413
Save Sunshine Mall!

1787
01:28:41,448 --> 01:28:43,517
Save Sunshine Mall!

1788
01:28:43,551 --> 01:28:45,655
Save Sunshine Mall!

1789
01:28:45,689 --> 01:28:48,068
Save Sunshine Mall!

1790
01:28:48,103 --> 01:28:50,137
Save Sunshine Mall!

1791
01:28:50,172 --> 01:28:51,827
- Save Sunshine Mall!
- Let's all give

1792
01:28:51,862 --> 01:28:54,793
a big hand to our Soul Santa!

1793
01:28:57,034 --> 01:28:59,413
Thank you, thank you, Santa!

1794
01:28:59,448 --> 01:29:00,689
Thank you!

1795
01:29:12,034 --> 01:29:14,517
I enjoyed the
Christmas show, Nicky.

1796
01:29:14,551 --> 01:29:16,034
Too bad you won't see it end.

1797
01:29:17,689 --> 01:29:21,551
- Look, I'm sorry...
- Too late for apologies, Nicky.

1798
01:29:21,586 --> 01:29:24,206
I'm going to turn you into
the new skeleton in my office.

1799
01:29:24,241 --> 01:29:26,724
Filet-a-Santa style.

1800
01:29:26,758 --> 01:29:30,965
Mr. Malone, I just need a
little time, I'll pay you back.

1801
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,482
Got the dough?

1802
01:29:32,517 --> 01:29:34,172
I had an offer for $100,000

1803
01:29:34,206 --> 01:29:36,034
but I would've had
to sell my soul.

1804
01:29:36,068 --> 01:29:40,482
Saved your soul as you
lose your life, huh?

1805
01:29:43,172 --> 01:29:45,758
- Get off me!
- Santa!

1806
01:29:47,551 --> 01:29:50,000
Honey, Santa needs our help!

1807
01:29:55,172 --> 01:29:57,034
Santa!

1808
01:29:57,068 --> 01:29:58,827
Y'all better let go
of Santa right now

1809
01:29:58,862 --> 01:30:02,103
before I throw hands,
and that's on period!

1810
01:30:08,551 --> 01:30:10,103
Thank you so much for coming,

1811
01:30:10,137 --> 01:30:12,034
I hope you're
enjoying yourselves.

1812
01:30:12,068 --> 01:30:13,103
Liz, Liz!

1813
01:30:13,137 --> 01:30:15,034
- E-e-excuse me. Yes?
- Good news!

1814
01:30:15,068 --> 01:30:16,482
I just heard from my accountant.

1815
01:30:16,517 --> 01:30:19,965
We met our goal,
the mall can stay open!

1816
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,551
Oh!

1817
01:30:26,931 --> 01:30:30,482
Thank you so much for coming!
Thank you so much!

1818
01:30:30,517 --> 01:30:32,034
Congratulations, but...

1819
01:30:32,068 --> 01:30:36,655
Before we celebrate, there's
something else I need to say.

1820
01:30:36,689 --> 01:30:38,137
Nicky, what are you doing?

1821
01:30:38,172 --> 01:30:43,103
I didn't get a chance to
apologize to everybody.

1822
01:30:43,137 --> 01:30:46,034
Especially you two.

1823
01:30:46,068 --> 01:30:48,068
I just wanna let you
know that I apologize

1824
01:30:48,103 --> 01:30:52,000
for all the hurt and
pain that I've caused.

1825
01:30:52,551 --> 01:30:54,620
Being here with you

1826
01:30:54,655 --> 01:30:58,482
and everybody else is,
is truly a miracle for me.

1827
01:31:00,620 --> 01:31:02,551
