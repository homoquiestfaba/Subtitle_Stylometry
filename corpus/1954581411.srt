1
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:42,945
Yeah, we'll see about that.

2
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,901
I wanna be traded.

3
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,060
Here's Tommy. Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

4
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,340
Happy Halloween!

5
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,429
I thought we were all
dressing as babies.

6
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,591
Sorry. Sorry.

7
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,860
Hey, baby, you're behind me.

8
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,505
I just wanna tell you I love you!

9
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,700
- No biking in the video.
- Here.

10
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,902
- Doesn't make sense.
- Oh, gosh. All right.

11
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,782
- Enough.
- Dan, why are you so flexible?

12
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,270
Let's get out of this...

13
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,231
Did you see that?

14
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,025
There it is!

15
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,980
It's really cold!

16
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,511
No, you don't.

17
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,980
- I think I'm filming.
- Are you filming? Thanks.

18
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,068
So, Jack, anything you wanna say to Dan?
'Cause this is it, buddy.

19
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,391
Tommy?

20
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,982
Don't you think if you're shooting the
wedding you should wear some pants?

21
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,743
Hi, how are you?

22
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,788
Dan, today is your day, my friend,
and we are happy to be here.

23
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,862
Tommy even wore his lucky boxers.

24
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,421
We're here for you, brother,
and we love you.

25
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,790
Lauren is late.

26
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,500
She's gotta be freaking
out that I'm late.

27
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,146
Any pre-wedding advice for Dan and Skylar?

28
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,020
Put the other person's needs first.

29
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,500
Maybe that's why I'm still single.

30
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,862
Quit chasing after
the wrong girls, buddy.

31
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,460
How you feeling, buddy?

32
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,740
Do not film me while I'm peeing.
That's not gonna make the video.

33
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,220
Oh, it is, it is.

34
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,500
I left my car running
outside if you wanna bolt.

35
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,940
Your car wouldn't make it
out of the parking lot.

36
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,380
- It's a piece.
- What? Just put some new tires on it.

37
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,980
Could always hijack the limo.

38
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,751
You need to find yourself
a girl like Skylar.

39
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,109
Groom wisdom. Nice.

40
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,140
I'm serious. There's nothing better than
being in an honest, committed relationship.

41
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,340
Coming from the guy who
just joined the church

42
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,860
because his fiancée wouldn't
have married him otherwise.

43
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,222
Hey, the girl gets what she wants, bro.

44
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,465
Gentlemen.

45
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,580
- Mr. Chapman.
- Mr. Chapman.

46
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,145
Congrats. Hey, nice wedding.

47
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,700
Okay, if this is as compelling content
as you're getting, we're gonna be in trouble.

48
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,220
- I got great stuff with Dan. Wait till you see it.
- I'm sure.

49
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,467
Get out of the way.

50
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,425
Just trying to capture the good,
the bad and the ugly.

51
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,981
Did you just use the word "ugly"
at Skylar's wedding?

52
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,946
I did.

53
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,671
- You know, you could help.
- I am. I got you in focus.

54
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,031
You gonna catch the bouquet?

55
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,265
Yeah, she is.

56
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,904
All right, let's do this.

57
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,749
Do you, Dan, take Skylar to
be your lawfully wedded wife,

58
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,300
and, forsaking all others,
keep thee only unto her,

59
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,700
so long as you both shall live?

60
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,140
I do.

61
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,501
And do you, Skylar, take Dan to
be your lawfully wedded husband?

62
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,342
- I do.
- The rings?

63
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,106
I give you this ring as a
sign of my promise to you.

64
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,026
With all that I have and
all that I am, I honor you.

65
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,708
I give you this ring as a
sign of my promise to you.

66
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,630
And with all that I have and
all that I am, I will honor you.

67
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,028
And now, by the power vested in me,

68
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,790
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

69
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,030
You may kiss your bride.

70
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,584
Dan! Come here!

71
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,104
- Hi.
- Hey.

72
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,180
Are you the videographer or something?

73
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,224
Documentaries.
I'm doing it as a favor for Dan.

74
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,620
I was his wingman throughout LSU.

75
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,829
Sorry, my name... I'm Tommy.

76
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,100
Ashton. Nice to meet you.

77
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,940
Nice meeting you. I'll facebook you.

78
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,630
She's taken, Tommy.

79
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,264
Story of my life.

80
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,980
Father, we come here today
to thank you for Skylar and Dan

81
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,626
and the gift they are to all of us here.

82
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,585
We ask that you keep them close

83
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,107
and keep them in your
heart and bless them.

84
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,510
- Amen.
- Amen.

85
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,781
What?

86
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,826
It's on me.

87
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,429
I will never forget when
Dan called me and said,

88
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,189
"I'm gonna ask Skylar to marry me."

89
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,990
Dan said to me, "When you find the one,

90
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,147
"whether you believe in God,
whether you believe in fate or whatever,

91
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,870
"you act on it."

92
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,542
And you did, and I tip my hat
to you for doing just that.

93
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,582
So let's give a warm round of
applause for the bride and the groom.

94
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,260
Cake for the girl at table one.

95
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,700
Is it diet?

96
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,940
Come on, you gotta be done
starving yourself. The wedding's over.

97
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,665
Good point.

98
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,865
Look at that.

99
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,350
So cute.

100
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,940
I've seen you in action at
weddings before, all right,

101
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,871
and currently you're not dancing
on a table or breaking glasses.

102
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,830
Come on. It's me.

103
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,220
I'm at my best friend's wedding and
I'm upset because my boyfriend

104
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,260
just gave a speech on
how important it is

105
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,304
to act on it when you cross
paths with the right person.

106
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,906
It was a pretty good speech.

107
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,820
I crossed paths with
Jack seven years ago.

108
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,943
No, no, I get it. I get it. I get it.

109
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,824
I'm so lame. I'm sorry.

110
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,064
No, you're not lame. Okay?
You are a catch.

111
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,911
Yeah. Most amazing girl I've ever met.

112
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,386
What?

113
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,269
- Top 100 for sure.
- Good. Funny.

114
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,469
But probably number one.

115
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,104
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

116
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,463
It's time for the bouquet toss.
Come on, ladies.

117
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,261
One!

118
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,420
- Two!
- Throw it over here, Skylar.

119
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,701
Three!

120
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,220
Let's get Jack here!

121
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,910
Jack, get up here!

122
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,740
Hey, baby. You okay?

123
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,980
- I gotta go.
- Why?

124
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,670
- What happened?
- Don't worry about it.

125
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,861
Is everything okay?

126
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,540
I love you, and I show it.
So I don't get it.

127
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,301
Either you don't love me, or you have a
really crappy way of letting me know it.

128
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,101
Am I missing something?
Seriously, I don't know what...

129
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,580
You rolled your eyes. It was a joke.

130
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,540
- Honey, I'm sorry.
- I can't do this anymore.

131
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,981
Wait. Hold on.
Please don't leave. Please.

132
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,140
I love you. I'm sorry. We...

133
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,380
Tommy. Really? Come on, man.

134
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,660
- Tommy, please?
- What's going on?

135
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,591
Come on, man. I know you got
a camera, but... Ally! Ally!

136
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,460
What's going on?

137
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,740
We'll just talk after.

138
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,980
We'll give her some time to cool down.
Let's go back and party. Come on.

139
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,989
- You sure?
- Yeah. Come on. Let's go.

140
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,300
Thanks for heading up to our room
to get the presents, Tommy.

141
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,990
Yeah, no problem.

142
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,700
Now that I have you guys trapped,
let me ask you this.

143
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,660
What is the secret to staying
married so many years?

144
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,385
I'm always right.

145
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,550
That's actually correct.

146
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,347
Skylar, if you're watching this now,
your wedding was absolutely perfect.

147
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,140
Would she have it any other way?

148
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,980
It should have been at the church.

149
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,980
It was her choice,
even if it's not what we wanted.

150
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,540
And Skylar always gets what she wants?

151
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,310
Like mother, like...

152
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,101
- Did you feel that?
- It just got so cold.

153
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,826
Mr. Chapman... Mrs. Chapman,
what's wrong? You okay?

154
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,021
You okay, Mr. Chapman?
Somebody help me! Help me!

155
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,065
Somebody help me!

156
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,860
What's happening?

157
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,550
She's not breathing.

158
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,820
Does anyone know CPR?

159
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,545
Tommy! Tommy!

160
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,900
Jack, I'm coming.
Stay there. I'm coming.

161
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,740
Sky!

162
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,220
I can't find her!

163
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,788
She's dead. She's not waking up.
Have you seen my parents?

164
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,302
- My mom? Please?
- Hey, Jack.

165
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,271
Jack. Jack.

166
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,421
Jack.

167
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,820
I was with Skylar's parents in the
elevator, and they just fell dead.

168
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,420
- What?
- They fell over. They just fell dead.

169
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,110
What?

170
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,549
Skylar, your parents were in
the elevator, and they just...

171
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,904
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

172
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,904
- I'm so sorry.
- Allison. Allison.

173
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,582
Sounded like a missile.
Come outside. Come on.

174
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,030
So close!

175
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,025
Look out! Get back!

176
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,824
Did you see that? Jack, Jack, come on!

177
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,580
Earthquake! Watch out! Watch out!

178
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,827
Run!

179
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,831
Tommy, look out!

180
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,666
Run! Come on, Sky!

181
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,870
Stay with me, Sky!

182
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,704
Get away from the window!

183
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,386
What is that?

184
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,506
Okay?

185
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,228
- I need to find Ally.
- We don't know where she is.

186
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,340
My phone doesn't have any service.
Does yours?

187
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,380
- Check my phone.
- It says she's at 45 North.

188
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,187
- When did she text you that?
- About a half hour ago. We gotta go.

189
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,341
Tommy!

190
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,860
So what do you think
killed all those people?

191
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,460
Why are we still alive?

192
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,620
The fact that there was an earthquake
and the lightning like that.

193
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,660
- I've never seen anything like that.
- Did you see their eyes?

194
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,431
- Maybe it's aliens!
- Yeah, Dan, it's aliens!

195
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,026
Look, guys, over here.
Over here, over here!

196
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,220
I'll stay right here with you, ma'am.

197
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,700
- Keep your head up.
- You okay, Sky?

198
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,390
Does that hurt you?

199
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,660
I heard my parents talk
about this for years.

200
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,100
What?

201
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,380
- It's the biblical end of the world.
- Don't be ridiculous.

202
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,500
It's not ridiculous.

203
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,180
All the good people are gone and
all the bad people are left here.

204
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,580
Whatever's happening is rooted
with science, all right, not fantasy.

205
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,148
- No. You're wrong.
- Am I? You go to church, right?

206
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,740
You're a good person,
you're still alive,

207
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,540
so it's obviously not the
biblical end of the world.

208
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,140
Guys, enough with the religious BS, okay?
It's happened, it's done,

209
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,627
and we all survived.
It's not the end of the world.

210
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,860
We have to get to safety,
'cause things are gonna get really bad.

211
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,107
What do you call this?

212
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,266
It's hail.

213
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,101
Go, go, go!

214
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,141
Don't let go of my hand!

215
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,904
Here! Come on! Get in the library!

216
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,705
Keep going!

217
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,831
Skylar! No!

218
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,100
- Where's Skylar?
- What?

219
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,380
- Where's Skylar?
- What do you mean?

220
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,786
Sky!

221
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,746
Get back. Skylar?

222
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,066
Skylar?

223
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,260
You go that way. You go that way.

224
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,746
- Skylar?
- Skylar?

225
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,941
Where are you?

226
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,021
Skylar?

227
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,661
Skylar?

228
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,060
He's dead. He won't bite.

229
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,666
Sam.

230
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,382
Yeah, I was kind of looking for...

231
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,381
Skylar?

232
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,061
Skylar?

233
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,744
Skylar? Skylar? Skylar? Sky!

234
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,740
- What's going on?
- There's got to be a Bible in here somewhere.

235
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,704
I'm gonna prove to you
guys what's going on.

236
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,425
Five rows over.

237
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,426
Sky, what are you doing?

238
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,948
Storm's passed. We need to find Ally.

239
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,266
Skylar, seriously?

240
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,789
Is this what you wanted?

241
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,060
See this?

242
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,149
- Is that a Bible?
- Yes, it's a Bible, Jack.

243
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,943
- It's not in here.
- What?

244
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,461
Rapture. It's not in here.

245
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,420
- Rapture?
- Hail.

246
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,827
- She's looking for Rapture.
- Hail. Hail.

247
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,591
Bro, come on. We gotta get Ally.

248
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,346
Hail.

249
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,625
"When the first one blew his trumpet,
there came hail and fire mixed with blood."

250
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,669
Sky, that's not helping.
That's not helping us.

251
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,100
I shouldn't be here. I went to church.
I did everything right.

252
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,825
You'll be okay. We're gonna be okay.

253
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,147
Stop.

254
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,664
It's okay. We're gonna be okay.

255
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,064
Let's get out of here.

256
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,180
- You guys, please! We can't leave!
- We're going to 45 North.

257
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,940
We're not going. No!
You don't understand.

258
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,223
- We can't go out there.
- She might be at the church on Camp Street.

259
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,945
She texted you 45 North.

260
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,700
You're right. You're right.

261
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,300
But I know she likes to go to that
church when she's upset and I'm...

262
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,180
When does Ally go to church, Tommy?

263
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,900
Every time you guys get in
a fight, she ends up there.

264
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,580
- What are you talking about?
- I'm her best friend.

265
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,784
- It's a new thing for her.
- We're going to 45 North.

266
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,220
The church is closer, all right?
And it's on the way.

267
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,780
- I think we should maybe check it out.
- What are you guys talking about?

268
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,665
- We have to stay here where it's safe.
- Fine. We're gonna go to the church.

269
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,181
We're staying.

270
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,660
Sky, this place isn't safe, all right?
What if there's another earthquake?

271
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,624
There's no food. There's no supplies.

272
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,420
- We gotta get going, we gotta stay together.
- No, I'm not going.

273
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,384
There's safety in numbers.

274
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,145
He's right. We should go.

275
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,701
Wait, "we"?

276
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,261
Yeah, we.

277
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,381
All right, well,
we gotta get moving. Let's go.

278
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,268
- This is a bad idea.
- We have to stay together.

279
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,381
Come on.

280
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,184
The church is on the
other side of First...

281
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,421
What is going on?

282
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,060
What could have brought
down these planes?

283
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,705
Do you believe me now?

284
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,430
Stay together. Stay together, guys.

285
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,149
- Is the church up ahead?
- Come on. Keep moving, guys.

286
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,309
Okay, where is everybody?

287
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,580
Where are the people? What's that?

288
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,030
It's the carriage to our...

289
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,105
I don't understand.

290
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,620
Dear God, please help me.
I don't understand what's going on.

291
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,780
What are you doing?

292
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,460
- Sky, praying isn't gonna help us.
- I'm sorry for not believing in...

293
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,980
- Can you hold up?
- We gotta keep moving, Dan.

294
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,580
- Come on.
- It's gonna be okay. All right?

295
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,140
- Please.
- Keep moving.

296
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,220
- Just don't let go of me, okay?
- I won't.

297
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,910
Did you hear that?

298
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,380
No.

299
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,025
Exactly. It just got quiet.

300
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,745
- What was that sound?
- I don't know. Let's keep moving.

301
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,146
Something's wrong.

302
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,670
Something's wrong.

303
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,380
Something just flew by. Feel that?

304
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,741
God, please be with us.

305
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,780
Keep going.

306
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,664
Lord, we really need you right now.

307
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,340
Something's in the tree.

308
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,065
What is that?

309
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,065
I didn't let go. I didn't let go!
She was right here.

310
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,060
She was right here! I didn't let go!
I didn't let go!

311
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,180
What are you talking about?
Where did she go?

312
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,381
Dan!

313
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,181
Sky?

314
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,824
Skylar! Skylar!

315
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,671
The church is right there!

316
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,421
Let's get inside! Go, go, go!

317
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,028
Help! Help!

318
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,347
Hey!

319
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,900
Help!

320
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,580
Get in. Get in.

321
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,270
Is she all right?

322
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,100
Do you know what did this to her?
Do you know what's happening?

323
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,461
You dropped this.

324
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,150
All the words are missing.

325
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,024
Let's get her into the sanctuary.

326
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,100
Help them, Doug. Sanctuary, please.

327
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,143
Inside. Inside.

328
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,060
- Put me down. Put me down.
- Are we gonna be safe in here?

329
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,388
Yes. I think so.

330
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,060
I'm Pastor Shay. And you are?

331
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,060
- Tommy. This is Jack.
- Tommy. Jack.

332
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,300
- Sam.
- Sam, Skylar, Dan.

333
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,468
Let's get some help for your friend.

334
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,470
I'll find Nurse Rachel.

335
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,500
Rachel! Nurse Rachel! We need help!

336
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,782
- Ally?
- Jack!

337
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,668
Jack! Tommy!

338
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,190
Sky! Is she hurt?

339
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,506
She's okay. Are you okay?

340
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,106
You came looking for me.

341
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,260
I tried to call. Everything was dead.

342
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,828
- It's okay. It's okay.
- How did you know I was here?

343
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,666
Tommy.

344
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,668
Where's Lauren? Where's everyone else?

345
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,149
They're dead, honey. They're all dead.

346
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,305
I'm sorry, honey.

347
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,670
What happened?

348
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,465
What did this to her?

349
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,584
We need to clean out that wound.

350
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,784
Looks like a stab wound.

351
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,022
It's okay. It's okay.

352
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,708
Remember when you
walked into Jack's party?

353
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,381
My jaw literally dropped. Yeah.

354
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,823
I never saw anybody so
beautiful in my whole life.

355
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,070
I love you, Ms. Gardner.

356
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,300
I'm gonna have to lift
the arm to reset it.

357
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,626
Mrs. Gardner.

358
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,347
Ready?

359
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,790
Good. Now the left side.

360
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,621
- Can we maybe give her a minute?
- No. Just do it.

361
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,900
Okay, hey, hey, hey.

362
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,500
You remember when we went
to go get our marriage license

363
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,782
and the office was over that crazy deli?

364
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,588
We had to wait for a copy
looking at pig's feet.

365
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,387
Hey. Hey. Hey.

366
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,864
It's okay. It's okay.

367
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,342
Do you have any idea
what's going on out there?

368
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,466
The Rapture.

369
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,782
Right out of the New
Testament of the Bible.

370
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,346
Come on.

371
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,780
You mean the thingy where Jesus
teleports the good to heaven...

372
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,061
The believers.

373
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,750
- ...and leaves us heathens...
- The nonbelievers.

374
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,261
We are all presented
with the same evidence.

375
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,545
I guess it's

376
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,700
what conclusion you
wish to draw from it.

377
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,380
I don't draw anything from it.

378
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,503
What do you think attacked your friend?

379
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,183
Aliens, maybe. I don't know.

380
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,831
I can't really explain it.

381
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,706
Aliens?

382
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,102
We'll find out soon enough.

383
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,469
There's more survivors coming in.

384
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,264
- Bring them inside.
- One of them's pregnant.

385
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,180
- Wet some towels.
- It's all right. Just breathe.

386
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,460
Remember, breathe. Breathe.
There we go. Breathe.

387
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,344
- One more.
- Hold my hand.

388
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,900
Yes!

389
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,387
One last one. One last one.

390
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,905
It's a boy.

391
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,543
Can I hold him? Please?

392
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,422
Can I hold him? Please?

393
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,344
Why isn't he crying?

394
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,110
Follow me.

395
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,951
You...

396
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,669
You knew the baby was
gonna be a stillborn.

397
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,186
I knew.

398
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,991
He was an innocent.

399
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,502
Why would God kill all these
people and an innocent baby?

400
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,151
He didn't.

401
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,308
He left their mortal bodies
behind and he took their souls.

402
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,186
That baby, he didn't get death.

403
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,545
He got eternal life. Bliss.

404
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,591
I was at home with my family
when they all were taken.

405
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,980
Then I heard the first trumpet.

406
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,467
- First trumpet?
- You didn't hear it?

407
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,390
I froze.

408
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,024
Knew instantly.

409
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,548
And all I could think
to do was come here.

410
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,466
I'm sorry for your loss.

411
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,190
Wasn't my loss. It was their gain.

412
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,987
Why weren't you taken?

413
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,543
Why wasn't I taken?

414
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,066
You know, just because you
have a church and a title

415
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,231
doesn't mean that you have real faith.

416
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,150
I had no relationship.

417
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,750
I just had comfort.

418
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,788
And that is how I failed.

419
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,260
All right, guys, come on, come on.
Circle up. Circle up.

420
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,349
All right, all of us. Come on.

421
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,625
- So how's Skylar?
- She's all right.

422
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,949
Ally and Dan are back there with her.

423
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,030
So what do you want to do?

424
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,300
Hole up here.

425
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,860
Hole up here? Hole up here until what?

426
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,740
We don't know what's going on out there.

427
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,740
So at least in here it
seems like we're safe.

428
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,340
So you just wanna sit in
here and see what happens?

429
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,260
Until we figure out a
better plan, Tommy.

430
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,260
Maybe we should move,
find another place.

431
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,464
To where?
Can't exactly move Skylar, can we?

432
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,629
Let me in! Let me in!

433
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,990
Help me! Help me!

434
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,140
My name's Tommy Covington.

435
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,549
If you are watching this,
then I'm probably dead.

436
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,745
It's been 10 hours since everything started,
and we made it to a church, found help.

437
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,140
If anything happens, Ally,
there's something I wanna...

438
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,865
I wanna say.

439
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,540
What are you doing?
I don't like people filming me.

440
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,820
Says the guy filming everyone.

441
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,751
So, what's so important
you need to tell Ally?

442
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,302
- It's complicated.
- Complicated.

443
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,580
Don't you think fire and ice falling
from the sky should uncomplicate things?

444
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,021
Yeah. Probably.

445
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,985
Then tell her what you wanted to say.

446
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,224
I'll show it to her
if something happens.

447
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,911
Allison, I...

448
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,742
When I met you seven years ago,

449
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,380
we just clicked.

450
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,740
Truth is,

451
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,262
I've loved you every day since.

452
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,582
And if it's not me,

453
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,627
I just want you to be happy.

454
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,223
I just want you to be happy.

455
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,546
Feel better?

456
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,940
Video footage has been streaming
in on a worldwide mysterious illness

457
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,380
that strikes without warning

458
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,220
and has caused millions of
fatalities in the past hour.

459
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,184
Oh, my God. Geez.

460
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,111
People are...

461
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,866
- Help!
- Say something.

462
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,380
This isn't right.

463
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,742
This isn't happening. What in...

464
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,660
Leading experts from around the globe

465
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,580
have been unable to determine
the cause of what is being labeled

466
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,623
"instant death syndrome."

467
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,060
The syndrome strikes without warning

468
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,584
and has universally caused death
in children and infants worldwide

469
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,220
as well as random segments
of the adult population.

470
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,700
- Are you okay?
- The car's on fire.

471
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,981
Get the extinguisher!

472
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,020
- What's going on?
- We need help over here!

473
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,100
Give me a hand! She's hurt!

474
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,340
- Are you okay?
- She's not breathing.

475
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,065
Go get it, Max. Yeah.

476
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,268
Talk to me. Are you guys okay?

477
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,460
We will continue to upload
videos as the story progresses

478
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,665
and we'll bring you breaking updates
as soon as we have them.

479
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,660
I'm so sorry about how
I left the reception.

480
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,460
It's okay.

481
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,860
It seems pretty stupid now.

482
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,188
I'm sorry that I was
the reason you left.

483
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,821
You came looking for me.
That's all that matters.

484
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,502
So how long you been
going to this church?

485
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,540
About six months.

486
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,471
I don't know, it's not like an
every Sunday thing or anything.

487
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,709
How come you never told me?

488
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,150
I knew you'd laugh. Or roll your eyes.

489
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,510
Yeah, I probably would've.

490
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,227
Then.

491
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,865
Not anymore.

492
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,304
Surprise!

493
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,065
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday, Mom!

494
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,260
We got you.

495
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,950
Happy birthday!

496
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,342
I love you all so much,
and you're so wonderful.

497
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,784
So where are your parents?

498
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,306
Killed.

499
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,587
Taken. Whatever they're calling it.

500
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,426
Sorry.

501
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,741
I hope you don't mind crunchy.

502
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,628
You wanna add anaphylactic
shock to our day?

503
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,506
I'm allergic.

504
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,430
Note to self. Note to self.

505
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,069
So, why are you here?
You're obviously a good person.

506
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,149
I am a good person.
Just not a churchy good person.

507
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,988
- You never went?
- I'm not really a "sit in a pew" kind of girl.

508
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,184
Guess I blew that one.

509
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,982
Yeah, yeah, I guess I did, too.

510
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,988
Are you this comforting all the time?

511
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,190
No, no, just...

512
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,863
Just when the world's ending.

513
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,380
We have received several eyewitness
accounts of unusual weather patterns.

514
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,740
Reports and images from around the world
are both troubling and foreboding.

515
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,380
The National Weather Service
has issued storm warnings

516
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,100
and travel advisories
from coast to coast

517
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,940
in the wake of this
unprecedented devastation.

518
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,500
Federal, state and local officials

519
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,060
are asking all individuals
to stay indoors.

520
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,620
Stay in your homes for the time being.

521
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,064
Safety is of utmost importance
at this very unpredictable time.

522
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,031
We're safe, okay? We're almost...

523
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,069
I don't know what I was waiting for.

524
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,547
I think I was waiting for a sign,
some "eureka" moment to happen.

525
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,747
And all you gotta do is make a choice.

526
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,665
I love you.

527
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,390
I love you.

528
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,501
And I know

529
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,943
that I wanna marry you.

530
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,588
Guys. You gotta see this.

531
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,030
I was filming and I caught it on tape.

532
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,826
I didn't let go. I didn't let go!
She was right here!

533
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,261
- May I see what you're looking at?
- Yeah.

534
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,900
Revelations 9.

535
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,540
I didn't let go!

536
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,983
And the fifth angel sounded his
trumpet and opened the abyss.

537
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,790
The sun and sky were darkened
and locusts fell upon the earth.

538
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,469
Their hair was like women's hair,
their teeth were like lion's teeth,

539
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,620
and their wings made the sound

540
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,664
like the thundering of many
horses rushing into battle.

541
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,580
Look, you can see it when
I go frame to frame.

542
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:33,183
They were given stingers like that
of scorpions to torment people.

543
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,951
What is this thing?

544
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,865
One of the fallen.

545
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,340
And what do they want?

546
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,941
To torture. To destroy.

547
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,630
Can we fight them?

548
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,141
No.

549
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,910
This is the first season
of bad things to come.

550
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,825
What, the first?

551
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,988
It's only gonna get worse.

552
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,341
- It's not right.
- What's not right, baby?

553
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,220
How do you feel?

554
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,060
I've given you the last dose of Vicodin,

555
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,700
so your pain should come down
just a little bit. Okay, sweetie?

556
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,780
No. Don't touch that.

557
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,980
- Let me look. Just let me look.
- No, stop. It's burning.

558
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,820
- No, it's okay.
- Please, no, it's burning.

559
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,503
I gotta get up. Stop! I wanna get...
Get out of here.

560
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,900
- I gotta get out of here!
- Calm down. It's okay.

561
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,501
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

562
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,740
Listen to me.

563
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:36,342
It's already getting infected, and I don't
have any antibiotics in here to help her.

564
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,820
Where do I get her the
medicine she needs?

565
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,020
My car. I have some sample
packets of amoxicillin,

566
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,791
but it's just too dangerous
to go out there.

567
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,101
- Give me the keys.
- It's not safe to go out there.

568
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,667
I'm going with you.

569
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,630
I'll go too.

570
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,710
We got this.

571
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,867
Let's go.

572
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,748
It's a green Chrysler minivan
blocked in on the Sixth Street side.

573
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,230
Just out of the parking lot.

574
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,222
- There's an SUV there, I think.
- Wait. You think?

575
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,268
I'm sorry. I got blocked in.

576
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,988
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
We'll find it. It's okay.

577
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,985
Keys?

578
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,701
Thanks.

579
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:32,621
Listen. The sample packets of amoxicillin
are in a duffel bag at the back of my van.

580
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,743
Hey, you sure you don't want me to go?

581
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,111
No, we're good.

582
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,582
- You sure about this?
- Yeah.

583
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,827
You hear that?

584
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,502
You should get in the
church where it's safe.

585
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,190
- Here's the SUV.
- Here it is!

586
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,900
- Unlock it.
- Why isn't it opening?

587
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,625
Unlock it!

588
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,741
I have an idea.

589
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,945
Tommy, lights!

590
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,820
I know what's going on!

591
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,980
Don't believe what the
government is feeding you.

592
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,420
There was no viral outbreak.

593
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,740
- Turn that off!
- No terrorist attack.

594
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,500
There are millions of
dead all around us.

595
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,660
All the children are dead.
This was the Rapture.

596
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,980
You need to understand that
there is only one way to God.

597
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,580
Only one way to eternal life.
You listen to me.

598
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,021
- Stop what you're doing, get down on your...
- I got it, I got it!

599
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,867
Something hit the front.
Something hit the front.

600
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,590
You don't act for God.

601
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,100
The power of Christ compels you!

602
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,665
Run! Go!

603
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,708
Run, Tommy! Come on, Tommy, come on!

604
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,740
They're coming.

605
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,900
Run, Tommy! Run!

606
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,580
Run! Run! Run!

607
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,111
Open the door!

608
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,821
Tommy!

609
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,022
You made it. Oh, good.
You got it. You got it.

610
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,428
What do you want to say to camera?

611
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,143
I don't know. Like a confession?

612
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,621
Sure. Yeah.
Get something off your chest.

613
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,630
I don't have anything to confess.

614
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,301
What do you want to say, Jack?

615
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,065
Tommy, why are you still filming?

616
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,980
'Cause if we don't make it out of this,

617
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,380
- somebody needs to know what happened.
- Don't say that.

618
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,389
We're gonna make it out of this, okay?

619
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,023
My name is Jack Turner.

620
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,664
I don't know why this is happening.

621
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,385
Don't know why.

622
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,222
But it's not gonna beat me.

623
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,900
I'm not ready to call it quits.
I don't know why you're filming.

624
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,181
Tommy, come on!

625
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,669
Do you love Allison?

626
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,621
Of course.

627
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,543
And it's taken you seven
years to figure that out?

628
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,340
- What?
- I just want to know how you feel.

629
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,030
Tommy, what are you doing?

630
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,540
I almost lost her today.
How do you think that feels, Tommy?

631
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,340
So it takes losing her
to feel something?

632
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,980
That's not love, Jack. She deserves
somebody who loves her, all right?

633
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,340
- She's a great girl. Seven years?
- What?

634
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,220
- Seven years?
- Stop it.

635
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,100
Do you know what I think it is, Tommy?

636
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,300
I think you got a confession
you need to make, Tommy.

637
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,300
- Guys! Guys!
- So go on. Say it.

638
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,660
- I don't have one.
- Come on. Say it.

639
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:59,780
- Say what?
- Say it!

640
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,020
- Don't!
- Say what?

641
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,500
You hang out with her all day.

642
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,580
- Guys, stop. Stop. Stop.
- You don't date.

643
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,820
- So say it, Tommy!
- Say what?

644
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,900
It's not so fun now that
I got the camera, is it?

645
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,420
Say it.

646
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,031
- Say it, Tommy.
- Stop it.

647
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,871
Fine.

648
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,465
Fine.

649
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,980
I love you, Allison.

650
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,340
- I knew it.
- What?

651
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,060
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

652
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,060
Jack, stop it! Guys, stop it!

653
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,149
Stop! Now! Stop!

654
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,788
- Katie Murphy.
- What?

655
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:54,507
It was after the LSU-Alabama game.
I drove Katie home.

656
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:59,790
And it was just a moment.
We just got caught up in it.

657
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,066
We both did, and it happened.

658
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,622
I tried to tell her
before we got married.

659
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,149
She deserves to know the truth, right?

660
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,669
Dan, it doesn't matter now.

661
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:18,584
Everything matters now.
Don't you see that?

662
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,991
I'm sorry.

663
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,222
So, Tommy, confession time
was a good idea.

664
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,743
What'd we learn from that?
You're an idiot.

665
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,341
This is an emergency notification alert.

666
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,620
During this emergency,
please seek shelter immediately.

667
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,140
Do not leave your home,
and avoid going out at night.

668
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,300
If you are unable to survive
under your current conditions,

669
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,780
search for a place of refuge set up
by civil and military authorities.

670
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,540
Civil and military authorities

671
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,660
are establishing relief centers
in major metropolitan areas.

672
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,260
- You okay?
- All broadcast and cable systems

673
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,380
shall transmit this
emergency alert message...

674
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,070
Yeah, I'm fine.

675
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,422
Let's see how she's doing.

676
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,224
There's nothing I can do for her.

677
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:47,460
- The antibiotics aren't working.
- What do you mean?

678
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:51,028
The infection, it's spreading.
It's acting like a venom.

679
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:55,860
You said she needed antibiotics,
and now you're saying you're not sure.

680
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,780
I've never seen anything
like this before.

681
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:02,065
She needs an antivenom like
Anascorp or a doctor who can help.

682
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,671
I'm sorry.

683
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:13,180
- I'm going to the hospital.
- No, wait, wait.

684
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,220
It's on the other side of
the freeway, all right?

685
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,583
On the other side of the freeway?
We almost didn't make it 30 feet.

686
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,140
I know it's not a good plan, all right,
but we got to save Sky.

687
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,180
- It's a couple hours till dawn.
- What does that have to do with anything?

688
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,220
Listen, those things, okay, whatever they are,
they've only attacked at night.

689
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,945
Maybe they're nocturnal.

690
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,151
Does she even have a couple hours?

691
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,620
She's a fighter.

692
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,983
She's fought it this long.
I'd wait until morning.

693
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,669
Pastor Shay wants to talk
to everyone in the sanctuary.

694
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,102
We leave for the hospital the
second the sun comes up.

695
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,791
- Yeah.
- Thanks, guys.

696
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,987
Come in.

697
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,589
You know, that was the first
real prayer I ever said.

698
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:25,110
Do you have any idea
how powerful it feels?

699
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,781
Can't say that I do.

700
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,789
It's not too late for us to believe, Tommy.
God still loves us all.

701
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,180
And if I do make it...

702
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:40,511
If we make it out of this mess,
we'll be raptured?

703
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:46,551
No. The Rapture is over.

704
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,910
- We missed that boat.
- Well, that's no good.

705
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:58,141
But we have hope in the path to the
Father and his gift of eternal life.

706
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,702
You have to make a choice, Tommy.

707
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,588
And what are you going to do?

708
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,024
I'm going to be a pastor
for the first time in my life.

709
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,151
For those of you whom I
haven't met, I am Pastor Shay.

710
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,991
And I have been a fraud.

711
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,185
It's true.

712
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,749
I walk through this sanctuary
with my soul asleep.

713
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,781
In Matthew, Jesus said

714
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:53,700
there will be those who use his name
in fancy speeches and sermons,

715
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,187
and Jesus said unto them,

716
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,220
"I never knew you."

717
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,941
Forgive me, Jesus. I never knew you.

718
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,420
I was a charlatan.

719
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:16,427
I was a traveling salesman passing
through life hocking his wares.

720
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,591
Like you and you.

721
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:27,066
I needed something miraculous
to open my eyes to the truth.

722
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,670
To see clearly.

723
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:35,628
I hold myself responsible
not only for my failed faith,

724
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,543
but everyone yet still
stands here today.

725
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,462
This is our wake-up call.

726
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,420
The path before us will not be easy.

727
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,304
It will not go unchallenged.

728
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,664
And this path will lead to pain
and suffering, even death.

729
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:59,181
But real life, eternal life,
is where the path leads.

730
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,631
But this is our opportunity.

731
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,542
I can now show you the way.

732
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,820
We can share this journey together.

733
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,827
Everyone, get to the basement!

734
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,828
Come on! Keep running! Keep running!
Keep running! Keep up with me!

735
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,783
- Where's Rachel?
- Has anyone seen Nurse Rachel?

736
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,260
Is Rachel in here? Rachel?

737
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,830
It's right above us.

738
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,662
Tommy? Tommy, what is it?

739
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,224
Everyone be quiet.

740
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:15,947
Sam.

741
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,905
Rachel!

742
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:35,269
- Help me! Help me!
- Rachel! Rachel!

743
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,661
Rachel!

744
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,503
Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!

745
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,425
Forgive me.

746
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,664
There's only one way out.

747
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,145
They're here for me.

748
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,743
Shay, don't go out there. No, Shay!

749
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,307
Please. Please.

750
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,824
I don't hear anything.

751
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,900
I'm gonna open the door.

752
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,306
- You ready?
- Yeah.

753
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,830
Come on, Sky.

754
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:15,021
The sun's up. Let's get to the hospital.

755
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,504
Baby, do you smell that?

756
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,751
Look at me. Hey. All right?

757
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,269
Don't look. Come on.

758
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,541
I think it's okay. Come on.

759
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,984
This is crazy.

760
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,506
Hey, there's nothing that way.

761
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,511
It's gone.

762
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,460
Come on, let's just get
to the relief center.

763
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,742
Where are these people going?

764
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,430
Let's find you a room.

765
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,785
There's got to be a doctor here.

766
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,546
Help her.

767
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:45,667
- Please. Please help her.
- We're getting out of here.

768
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,386
There's a relief center
at the Riverfront Bridge.

769
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,231
There's nothing. Nothing.

770
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,900
- You got her?
- Yeah.

771
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,465
The place has been ransacked,
cleaned out.

772
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,344
There's nothing in that pharmacy.

773
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:18,901
Guys, there's nothing left.

774
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:24,540
Hey. I'm gonna go upstairs
and find her a doctor, okay?

775
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,380
Someone who can help.
There has got to be a doctor here.

776
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,787
I'm gonna go with him.
Sam, Sam, you stay here, okay?

777
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,221
Tommy.

778
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,985
Be careful.

779
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:06,661
Jack!

780
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,270
Jack, wait up.

781
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,061
Jack.

782
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,306
Jack!

783
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:20,902
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look, I need this.

784
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,180
I can handle this on my own, Tommy.

785
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,950
Yeah, I know.

786
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,904
I read somewhere that the
light you see before you die

787
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:47,703
is just your brain releasing massive amounts
of endorphins to ease the pain of death.

788
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,502
Some people believe that.

789
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:57,509
There are others that believe the
light is a sign of God's existence.

790
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,629
Do you believe that?

791
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,181
I do.

792
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,946
Son of a...

793
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:21,500
Why do you have to get to a point where
something's going to be taken from you

794
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,101
for you to realize how important it is?

795
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,067
No need to explain. I know you love her.

796
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,706
Yeah.

797
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,780
Yeah.

798
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,264
Did you hear that?

799
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:04,421
Did you hear that?

800
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,870
Did you hear that? What was that?

801
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,340
One,

802
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,180
two,

803
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:07,427
three.

804
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,550
Let's keep going.

805
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,544
Hi, sweetie.

806
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,625
Hey.

807
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,110
I'm right here.

808
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:12,910
I'm right here.

809
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,383
Are you still hurting?

810
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,782
I don't really feel anything.

811
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,386
I forgive you for everything.

812
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,271
- How did you...
- I heard you.

813
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,270
I love you.

814
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,381
Dan...

815
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,550
Where I grew up

816
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,582
if you didn't go to church,
people looked at you funny.

817
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,548
So that's what I did.

818
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:06,301
I never really believed.

819
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:12,144
And that's okay.

820
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,185
I get it now.

821
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,350
I love you.

822
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,190
Do you see that?

823
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,664
It's so bright.

824
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,384
It's beautiful.

825
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,550
No, please.

826
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,500
Stay with me, Sky. Please stay with me.

827
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,304
Hey. Hey.

828
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,510
Don't leave me.

829
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,589
Somebody help her, please!

830
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,311
Dan, there's no one here to help her.

831
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,748
How can you sit there

832
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,741
and pray to a god that would
let this happen to her?

833
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,384
She was your friend.

834
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:57,787
Dan!

835
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,469
Will you do something for me?

836
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:20,261
I was wrong, and I realize that now.

837
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:27,020
I spent my whole life telling
myself that I was spiritual

838
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,302
and that was enough.

839
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,230
Obviously, that didn't work out too well.

840
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:40,541
I hate you!

841
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,184
- I hate you!
- What's Dan doing?

842
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,143
I hate you, you hear me?

843
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,380
Come on! Give it to me! I'm right here!

844
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,940
- Dan!
- Dan, stop!

845
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,500
- I hate you!
- Dan, no!

846
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,862
- Give it to me, God!
- Dan, stop!

847
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,861
God, are you even listening to me?

848
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,785
Please.

849
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,261
No, Dan!

850
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,460
We don't have much
time left on this earth.

851
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,503
We have to make a decision.

852
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,621
Ally?

853
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,061
Ally?

854
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:04,820
Oh, no.

855
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,820
Listen, maybe they're looking for us.

856
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,741
This way.

857
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,186
Ally?

858
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,820
Ally?

859
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,590
No, please.

860
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:46,220
Go! Sam, run! Run! Run! Don't look back!
Don't look back! Just go!

861
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,945
Just go!

862
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,340
She's not here! Ally's not there.

863
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,464
Tommy, what do you see? What's wrong?

864
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,260
Oh, God, no.

865
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:19,621
No, no.

866
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,020
I was hiding.

867
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,620
They didn't get me. I was so scared!

868
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:26,420
You're okay. You're okay.

869
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:30,780
You're okay. You're okay.
You're okay. You're okay.

870
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,186
Let's go.

871
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:53,386
Listen, we got to go.

872
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,300
We need to get to the relief center.

873
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,025
I'm not leaving her.

874
01:14:58,720 --> 01:14:59,660
You can go.

875
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:02,700
No, you were my best friends
and I will not leave you.

876
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,340
- I'm not leaving her! You can go!
- No.

877
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,030
No, I won't.

878
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,068
- Just go.
- No.

879
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:14,706
Jack, she's gone.

880
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,864
I mean it. Go.

881
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,500
She's...

882
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,384
Shut up!

883
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,024
Stop! Stop!

884
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:31,060
- Get off of him!
- There's nothing out there that I want.

885
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,740
Do you understand that?
Do you understand?

886
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,465
Then I'm staying, too.

887
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,062
So take all the time you need.

888
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,187
We'll stay as long as it takes.

889
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,340
Do you think we'll be safe there?

890
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,900
The military must be at
the Riverfront Bridge.

891
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,104
They'll have food, supplies.
They'll know what to do.

892
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,547
There it is.

893
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,740
The governor has issued an edict

894
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:48,468
asking all nonmilitary personnel
to check in at the main gate.

895
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:52,980
Food, shelter, donated clothing
and medical supplies

896
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,940
are available to all those in need.

897
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:59,100
For those with more serious
medical conditions,

898
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:03,100
please report to the triage area
outside our hospital tent,

899
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:07,260
where you can be evaluated
and treated in a timely manner.

900
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,780
If you have any further questions,

901
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:13,622
please ask any uniformed military
personnel stationed throughout the area.

902
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,660
You think that's where they're
setting up the church?

903
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,908
I heard they're bringing in a chaplain.

904
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,343
It's the group from the church.

905
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,788
You made it. Welcome.

906
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:41,310
Come and get warm.
Warm yourself here, huh?

907
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,590
It's good to see you.

908
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,431
Now what?

909
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,902
Get in line right over there.

910
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,707
Please get this to the chapel.

911
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,621
I need to show you guys something.

912
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:23,901
I was wrong, and I realize that now.

913
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:30,380
I spent my whole life telling
myself that I was spiritual

914
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,389
and that that was enough.

915
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,828
Obviously, that didn't
work out too well.

916
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,025
But now,

917
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,704
I found real faith.

918
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:54,271
These demons are here to
remove the Word of God.

919
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,626
Don't you see?

920
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:02,581
It has to be the truth.
Even they recognize it.

921
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:07,067
We all have to make a choice.

922
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:12,581
We can choose to accept and believe

923
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:15,820
and get life like we've never known it,

924
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:20,662
or continue to live selfishly,
ignoring God,

925
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:24,103
and end up dying anyway.

926
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,381
We all have to make a choice.

927
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,508
We don't have much
time left on this earth.

928
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:44,384
You have to make a decision.

929
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,869
I choose God.

930
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:02,667
Go! Go! Sam, run! Run! Run!

931
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:24,863
- Is he going to be okay?
- Give him some time.

932
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:40,901
Faith.

933
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:43,787
What'd you say?

934
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,311
They're drawn to faith.

935
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:51,427
We got to find Jack.

936
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,547
Wait! Tommy!

937
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:56,020
Turn off the music!
Turn it off! Turn it off!

938
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:58,700
Where's the PA? Where's the PA?
Turn off the music.

939
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:07,227
Turn the music off!

940
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,827
Baptism is an outward sign
of an inward commitment.

941
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:17,701
Jack!

942
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:22,580
It's also like taking the witness stand
to declare the truth of the Gospel

943
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:24,066
to all who are present.

944
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,866
They're coming!

945
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,027
Jack!

946
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:43,546
Sam!

947
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:46,026
Sam!

948
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:47,940
Sam!

949
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,911
Sam, I got you. I got you.

950
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:55,545
There's only one way, Tommy.
We have to make a choice.

951
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,422
Jack did. Allison did.

952
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,989
And I think they made the right one.

953
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,547
The choice is ours, Tommy.
It always has been.

954
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:09,630
Listen, don't go.

955
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,984
I choose God, Tommy. You should, too.
