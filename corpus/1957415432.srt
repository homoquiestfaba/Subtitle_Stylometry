1
00:01:35,865 --> 00:01:38,482
<i>Day 13.252,</i>

2
00:01:39,673 --> 00:01:42,260
<i>log entry 8761.</i>

3
00:01:44,823 --> 00:01:46,622
<i>Nearly there.</i>

4
00:01:47,632 --> 00:01:52,055
<i>Our goal is to establish a connection
with the emitter's civilization.</i>

5
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:53,527
<i>We've collected information,</i>

6
00:01:53,612 --> 00:01:57,322
<i>but the strong background radiation
interferes with our observation.</i>

7
00:01:58,248 --> 00:02:03,277
<i>It is now certain that the planet's
radio emissions are artificial.</i>

8
00:02:03,677 --> 00:02:06,622
<i>There are no discharges
from the storms in the atmosphere.</i>

9
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:08,307
<i>What a time to be alive!</i>

10
00:04:54,703 --> 00:04:56,890
-Good morning!
-Hello.

11
00:04:59,253 --> 00:05:00,605
We're landing.

12
00:05:00,705 --> 00:05:02,355
-Where are we?
-That's Brooklyn.

13
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,110
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

14
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,057
-Sit down!
-What?

15
00:05:07,157 --> 00:05:09,332
-Do you want to die?
-Are we going down?

16
00:05:09,415 --> 00:05:12,247
-No. But still.
-Don't worry!

17
00:05:22,727 --> 00:05:24,258
It is very beautiful.

18
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,158
He'll be glad to see it.

19
00:05:28,877 --> 00:05:30,422
Now...

20
00:05:30,522 --> 00:05:32,122
-Fuck.
-What's the problem?

21
00:05:32,222 --> 00:05:34,235
Nothing. The card is full.

22
00:05:38,355 --> 00:05:40,343
-Go back!
-No, not now.

23
00:05:44,285 --> 00:05:46,797
-Don't delete these.
-I've already saved those.

24
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,315
OK.

25
00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:41,375
-Turn around?
-Yes.

26
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,937
You can come in me!

27
00:08:00,037 --> 00:08:01,737
Should you take the pills again?

28
00:08:01,837 --> 00:08:03,137
No.

29
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:08,307
What?

30
00:08:11,803 --> 00:08:13,553
When did you want to tell me?

31
00:08:14,338 --> 00:08:15,623
What?

32
00:08:23,382 --> 00:08:26,022
When did you want to tell me
that you'll have a baby?

33
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,805
-I won't have one.
-But you certainly would like one.

34
00:08:30,473 --> 00:08:32,023
-Why? Don't you want one?
-No.

35
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,398
Look, we need to go.

36
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,498
OK.

37
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:36,458
-C'mon, please. Call me a taxi.
-OK.

38
00:10:36,558 --> 00:10:37,758
Now!

39
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:41,453
Wait, it's Zsolt.
I must answer.

40
00:10:42,027 --> 00:10:43,253
Hello, little brother!

41
00:10:43,553 --> 00:10:48,190
<i>Hello, Peti! Have you
found out anything about Dad?</i>

42
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,923
Look, I haven't known anything
about Father for 36 years.

43
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:54,103
-I haven't even had time to unpack.
-Péter, how is it?

44
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:55,392
Wait.

45
00:10:55,492 --> 00:10:56,703
What is this like?

46
00:10:57,003 --> 00:11:00,203
-Or should I try another one?
-Wait, wait, no. What?

47
00:11:00,303 --> 00:11:02,320
No, I was talking to Dóra.

48
00:11:02,403 --> 00:11:05,148
Have you met
the documentary guy yet?

49
00:11:05,842 --> 00:11:07,392
<i>Listen, I've emailed him.</i>

50
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:10,587
-<i>He didn't answer yet.</i>
-But...

51
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:14,077
-<i>But did you talk to him?</i>
-No.

52
00:11:14,177 --> 00:11:17,260
<i>I called,
but he didn't pick up.</i>

53
00:11:19,207 --> 00:11:20,758
<i>He did get the picture, though?</i>

54
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:23,158
-Yeah. Of course.
<i>-Yes?</i>

55
00:11:23,258 --> 00:11:24,858
<i>Didn't I cc you?</i>

56
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,958
No, you didn't cc me at all!

57
00:11:27,058 --> 00:11:31,118
-Of course, I did cc you.
-<i>No, you didn't. Never mind.</i>

58
00:11:31,218 --> 00:11:33,218
-Put this on.
-OK, thanks.

59
00:11:33,618 --> 00:11:37,952
Oh, and Mom says she pulled your fridge
out from the wall and cleaned it.

60
00:11:38,052 --> 00:11:40,708
<i>-What did she do that for?</i>
-Ask her.

61
00:11:40,808 --> 00:11:43,752
<i>Did I defrost your fridge?
Shall I call her so you can ask?</i>

62
00:11:44,452 --> 00:11:46,872
<i>I'll show you around.</i>

63
00:11:46,955 --> 00:11:49,580
<i>We are in Queens now.
We got this flat from...</i>

64
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,327
Not for free, though.
We pay for it.

65
00:11:55,772 --> 00:11:58,762
Look at this! Cool, huh?

66
00:12:00,372 --> 00:12:01,742
How do you like it?

67
00:12:03,758 --> 00:12:04,837
Looks nice, right?

68
00:14:22,848 --> 00:14:24,875
You did so much for it, indeed.

69
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:27,632
Listen, we rent a car,

70
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:31,432
drive down there, have a look around.
There and back, that's it.

71
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,080
We get married in Las Vegas
while we're there.

72
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,270
-Forget it!
-Down Route 66, baby.

73
00:14:38,883 --> 00:14:42,008
Motels in the evening, tequila...

74
00:14:43,737 --> 00:14:45,795
Las Vegas
isn't even in that direction!

75
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:51,812
There. Under Contacts.

76
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,612
Write them.

77
00:14:58,707 --> 00:15:03,117
Yeah. Maybe I should take it easy.
Forget all this bullshit.

78
00:15:03,217 --> 00:15:05,733
And we could go down
to Long Island over the weekend.

79
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:08,667
Or even better, Rob picked up
from Facebook that I'm here.

80
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:13,928
Rob... there was nothing more,

81
00:15:14,593 --> 00:15:17,093
and he's married
and lives in Brooklyn Heights now.

82
00:15:17,493 --> 00:15:19,493
He suggested
we go to Atlantic City.

83
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,668
Kim's band is playing
at the Knitting Factory--

84
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:05,257
Come in, Falcon!
Falcon, do you copy?

85
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:09,773
<i>Have you found out anything about Dad?
Is it true about the explosions?</i>

86
00:17:09,857 --> 00:17:10,693
Oh, fuck.

87
00:17:10,775 --> 00:17:14,053
<i>He might have disappeared
because he was recruited</i>

88
00:17:14,438 --> 00:17:18,677
<i>at that conference in Sweden.
The CIA</i>

89
00:17:18,777 --> 00:17:20,777
<i>or the KGB
could have recruited him.</i>

90
00:17:21,277 --> 00:17:23,442
<i>-What?</i>
-Nothing. I was not talking to you.

91
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,580
<i>What's going on?</i>

92
00:17:24,662 --> 00:17:27,497
Nothing, I'm just
letting the love of my life walk away.

93
00:17:27,897 --> 00:17:30,113
Never mind,
but I've talked to a lady who--

94
00:17:30,197 --> 00:17:32,777
<i>Is it him? In the docu?</i>

95
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,480
<i>Was he part
of the mess in Colorado?</i>

96
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,335
<i>And what about the explosions?</i>

97
00:17:37,415 --> 00:17:38,920
<i>What's true
in the story about the explosions?</i>

98
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,960
Hang on a sec.

99
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:23,358
Hey! Péter!

100
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,000
What's up?
I was waiting for you for half an hour.

101
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:28,958
-Are you OK?
-Of course.

102
00:19:43,695 --> 00:19:45,345
Are you sure you don't want any?

103
00:19:45,538 --> 00:19:47,238
Yes, yes.

104
00:19:50,787 --> 00:19:52,607
-No, thanks.
-Just a bite.

105
00:19:52,707 --> 00:19:54,207
No, no, Dóra, please.

106
00:19:54,407 --> 00:19:56,107
I said no. Don't do it, please!

107
00:19:56,207 --> 00:19:59,052
-I'm not hungry.
-OK.

108
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:09,113
Take it. No problem.

109
00:20:18,502 --> 00:20:20,633
<i>...go that way.
There's roadwork there,</i>

110
00:20:20,717 --> 00:20:24,833
<i>but if you hurry,
you can be there in two days.</i>

111
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,833
<i>Take Route 76,</i>

112
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:30,095
<i>then 74 from Pittsburgh
to St. Louis.</i>

113
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:32,195
<i>There's roadwork there,</i>

114
00:20:32,295 --> 00:20:35,938
<i>but if you hurry,
you can be there in two days.</i>

115
00:20:36,638 --> 00:20:40,188
-<i>You should leave tomorrow--</i>
-Zsolt, can you fucking leave me alone?!

116
00:20:40,443 --> 00:20:42,443
<i>OK, listen, another thing...</i>

117
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:47,562
<i>Is it possible
that you don't mention to Dad </i>

118
00:20:47,662 --> 00:20:50,648
<i>that I'm in a wheelchair
when you meet him?</i>

119
00:20:51,048 --> 00:20:56,513
<i>You could just tell him
I was busy and couldn't come.</i>

120
00:22:18,517 --> 00:22:21,492
What do you think this is?
Some kind of fucking competition?

121
00:22:21,575 --> 00:22:24,768
I just wish you would
stand up for yourself for once

122
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,387
and not come running
whenever he whistles.

123
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:30,693
-So I should be a man, huh?
-Oh, give me a break.

124
00:22:30,778 --> 00:22:33,783
And what if this is
what I feel like doing?

125
00:22:33,883 --> 00:22:35,883
No. This is what Zsolt wants.

126
00:22:40,112 --> 00:22:43,547
Yeah. Right.
While all I want is to get to know

127
00:22:43,647 --> 00:22:45,647
all the guys
who ever looked at you.

128
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:48,797
Miles more exciting
than finding out who my father is.

129
00:26:09,918 --> 00:26:11,593
Hi, Zsolt. Here we are.

130
00:26:11,893 --> 00:26:14,273
Now, where did I bring you?
Beautiful, huh?

131
00:26:14,997 --> 00:26:17,918
The visitor center
is 12 miles away from here.

132
00:27:06,098 --> 00:27:09,997
Houston, Houston!
Can you hear me?

133
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,262
<i>I hear you. Apollo here.</i>

134
00:27:14,362 --> 00:27:16,362
Hi, Apollo.

135
00:27:16,653 --> 00:27:18,685
<i>I was in the La Paloma Museum.</i>

136
00:27:18,785 --> 00:27:21,602
<i>They've got exhibitions
on everything from the '50s,</i>

137
00:27:21,685 --> 00:27:25,785
<i>but they know nothing
about what happened in the '70s.</i>

138
00:27:25,885 --> 00:27:27,885
<i>But I won't give up.
Wait a minute.</i>

139
00:27:29,432 --> 00:27:32,232
<i>Don't worry, though.
They won't get rid of me this easily.</i>

140
00:27:33,582 --> 00:27:34,852
<i>Wait...</i>

141
00:27:37,257 --> 00:27:38,842
The documentary guy?

142
00:27:39,788 --> 00:27:41,042
<i>Yes...</i>

143
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:04,637
<i>Here we are, at the mysterious
La Paloma Research Institute.</i>

144
00:32:05,272 --> 00:32:10,078
<i>We hope to find traces
of the famed Péter Horváth,</i>

145
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:15,188
<i>the scientist who left Hungary,
his wife</i>

146
00:32:15,288 --> 00:32:17,488
<i>and two beautiful sons
in 1980.</i>

147
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:26,883
<i>I hope I won't have three heads
when I go home.</i>

148
00:32:40,107 --> 00:32:45,917
<i>Zsolt, maybe they are
the descendants of the scientists.</i>

149
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:50,198
<i>If we look around,
maybe we'll find something interesting.</i>

150
00:32:50,283 --> 00:32:51,783
This is Prothero's office.

151
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,192
<i>Wow!</i>

152
00:32:58,683 --> 00:33:01,323
-Hello, Zsolt. Look where I am!
<i>-Where?</i>

153
00:33:01,423 --> 00:33:04,113
Got in. This is
Professor Prothero's office.

154
00:33:04,213 --> 00:33:06,213
See? Look what I found.

155
00:33:06,313 --> 00:33:08,313
A list with a shitload of names.

156
00:33:10,727 --> 00:33:13,777
Look, can you see this oven?

157
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,505
<i>That's probably
an old cryotron IBM.</i>

158
00:33:16,605 --> 00:33:17,805
Really?

159
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:25,440
<i>-Who is this?</i>
-My secretary, Zsolt.

160
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,640
<i>Aren't you happy for her?
This is cool, no?</i>

161
00:33:28,477 --> 00:33:30,893
Yeah. Cool.
Although if you had asked me,

162
00:33:30,993 --> 00:33:35,377
I'd have told you to start
with some kind of database.

163
00:33:36,138 --> 00:33:39,788
Then it would've been absolutely clear
right from the beginning that--

164
00:33:40,265 --> 00:33:42,957
<i>Zsolt, take it easy.</i>

165
00:33:43,057 --> 00:33:46,628
-OK, I'm not--
-We are this close!

166
00:33:47,128 --> 00:33:48,527
-I will find him.
-OK.

167
00:33:49,668 --> 00:33:51,227
I will find him. I promise!

168
00:33:52,338 --> 00:33:53,212
-OK?
-<i>OK.</i>

169
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:54,080
I promise!

170
00:33:54,683 --> 00:33:56,127
-<i>Bye-bye.</i>
-Bye.

171
00:34:02,355 --> 00:34:05,043
Miss Holliway,
call the president now!

172
00:34:06,532 --> 00:34:08,210
Or I'll push the big red button.

173
00:35:50,813 --> 00:35:52,927
-Hello.
<i>-Hello.</i>

174
00:35:53,575 --> 00:35:54,775
What's up?

175
00:35:55,412 --> 00:35:56,675
<i>Where are you?</i>

176
00:35:57,412 --> 00:35:58,675
I'm in America.

177
00:36:00,448 --> 00:36:01,448
<i>But where?</i>

178
00:36:01,548 --> 00:36:03,548
I'm here,
I just went for the lighter.

179
00:36:03,648 --> 00:36:05,665
<i>OK, but what is it?
Is something wrong?</i>

180
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:07,648
No. Nothing is wrong.

181
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,885
Everything is all right.
I like this country.

182
00:36:09,985 --> 00:36:12,693
I've tasted the flavor of freedom.
I would say that.

183
00:36:12,793 --> 00:36:14,793
You know, it's a family trait.

184
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:19,087
I might stay here.
Or maybe I'll blow up some kayaker.

185
00:36:19,187 --> 00:36:22,533
-I haven't decided yet.
<i>-Are you serious?</i>

186
00:36:22,618 --> 00:36:25,758
I may disappear for one or two days,
years. Or for a lifetime.

187
00:36:25,843 --> 00:36:28,683
<i>Listen, you haven't
picked up the phone for four days.</i>

188
00:36:28,768 --> 00:36:31,117
I didn't answer the phone
because...

189
00:36:33,462 --> 00:36:37,227
because I wasn't near it.
I wasn't there.

190
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:39,477
<i>But Zsolt told me
that you were there.</i>

191
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:42,473
What? Did you just call Zsolt?

192
00:36:42,573 --> 00:36:45,105
<i>Why? What the fuck
should I have done instead?</i>

193
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:47,222
<i>I asked you to leave Zsolt alone.</i>

194
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,605
<i>-I'm worried about you.</i>
-It's OK. I'm fine.

195
00:36:49,705 --> 00:36:52,305
<i>Otherwise, you don't need to worry.
I'm on my period.</i>

196
00:36:52,505 --> 00:36:53,505
What?

197
00:36:54,505 --> 00:36:56,505
<i>I'm coming to you.</i>

198
00:36:57,105 --> 00:36:59,105
What? Do not!
Do not come here, Dóra!

199
00:36:59,205 --> 00:37:01,222
<i>-No!</i>
-You are out of your mind.

200
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:03,732
-<i>Dóra, don't you dare come here.</i>
-I'm coming.

201
00:37:03,817 --> 00:37:07,117
<i>If you want to break up with me,
say it to my face!</i>

202
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,273
-OK, I'm coming there.
<i>-Everyone leave me the fuck alone!</i>

203
00:37:11,373 --> 00:37:13,373
<i>I'm coming!</i>

204
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:28,377
Got you!

205
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:07,117
Hogarth!

206
00:45:08,383 --> 00:45:09,517
<i>What?</i>

207
00:45:10,263 --> 00:45:13,417
-Zsolt, I said Hogarth!
<i>-What? Hello?</i>

208
00:45:15,287 --> 00:45:18,085
Everything is true.
All of it is in the library.

209
00:45:18,168 --> 00:45:21,887
They have developed a weapon.
And the army was in on it.

210
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:25,673
He just mixed up
Horváth with Hogarth.

211
00:45:26,955 --> 00:45:28,502
What is this clicking, Zsolt?

212
00:45:34,458 --> 00:45:35,797
You're here, Zsolt?

213
00:48:58,028 --> 00:48:59,472
Are the strawberries good?

214
00:49:01,685 --> 00:49:03,635
They're rarely good
this time of year.

215
00:49:04,068 --> 00:49:06,668
The strawberries...

216
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:43,107
Don't you recognize me?

217
00:49:46,943 --> 00:49:50,177
Dad, I'm Peter, your son.

218
00:49:52,693 --> 00:49:54,015
Don't you recognize me?

219
00:49:55,053 --> 00:49:57,547
Don't you recognize me?
Dad, I'm Peter.

220
00:49:57,947 --> 00:50:00,847
Speak to them, Dad!
I just want to talk to you.

221
00:50:00,947 --> 00:50:02,362
Dad!

222
00:50:09,177 --> 00:50:10,393
How is it?

223
00:50:10,792 --> 00:50:12,293
Is this Dad?

224
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:14,105
What? What did you say?

225
00:50:14,273 --> 00:50:15,703
It looks cool.

226
00:50:16,105 --> 00:50:17,348
And...

227
00:50:19,362 --> 00:50:21,952
Watch carefully.
Does the gentleman look familiar?

228
00:50:24,315 --> 00:50:25,515
Are you sure?

229
00:50:31,593 --> 00:50:33,567
Hi, Dad! Say hello.

230
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:29,918
I'm sorry.

231
00:58:30,018 --> 00:58:32,018
Oh, no, no.

232
00:58:32,118 --> 00:58:34,135
That's not what I came for.

233
00:58:34,218 --> 00:58:37,583
I just always wanted to ask...

234
01:01:34,672 --> 01:01:38,172
<i>Hi. This is me. I think you know me OK,
so I'll pass it on to Father.</i>

235
01:05:27,573 --> 01:05:32,070
<i>Day 13.302, log entry 8788.</i>

236
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:34,367
<i>The radio interference
is the strangest thing.</i>

237
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:38,223
<i>About a hundred million satellites
circle around the planet.</i>

238
01:05:38,308 --> 01:05:41,410
<i>They only transmit
chaotic white noise.</i>

239
01:05:41,925 --> 01:05:43,937
<i>There is no sign
of a definable signal.</i>

240
01:05:44,037 --> 01:05:47,778
<i>The worst thing is that the crew is
starting to divide into opposing groups.</i>

241
01:05:48,832 --> 01:05:52,092
<i>I don't remember
who used it first and what for,</i>

242
01:05:52,192 --> 01:05:56,018
<i>but they mentioned
demonstration of power.</i>

243
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:03,627
<i>Day 13.304, log entry 8790.</i>

244
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:07,020
<i>After 279 days,
there is still no signal.</i>

245
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:11,310
<i>We sent a scout rocket, but it had
no effect. It exploded before landing.</i>

246
01:08:11,815 --> 01:08:16,442
<i>The tendency towards depression
changed into aggression in the crew.</i>

247
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:20,180
<i>Captain Vick can't wait anymore.
The counterattack is inevitable</i>

248
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:23,422
<i>even if we don't have any evidence
of an intentional firing.</i>

249
01:08:23,505 --> 01:08:25,705
<i>Neither do we have one
for an accidental firing.</i>

250
01:08:26,327 --> 01:08:28,543
<i>Apart from this palpable event,</i>

251
01:08:28,643 --> 01:08:31,977
<i>we didn't get
any interpretable signal for 300 days.</i>

252
01:14:05,092 --> 01:14:09,455
Come in and tell him that
we've never gotten a single package.

253
01:14:14,477 --> 01:14:15,777
We haven't? We never got any.

254
01:14:15,867 --> 01:14:17,867
-Turn it off now!
-No, I won't!

255
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,207
-Stop shouting!
-You stop shouting!

256
01:14:23,287 --> 01:14:25,800
Go away! Get out or I'll scream!
Do you hear me?

257
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:26,680
Turn it off!

258
01:14:26,788 --> 01:14:28,788
Go away! Get out!
Get out or I'll scream.

259
01:16:07,797 --> 01:16:10,123
All right, it's enough.

260
01:17:36,148 --> 01:17:37,868
Oh, take it a little slower.

261
01:17:38,468 --> 01:17:41,118
He doesn't have a scarf on.
He'll catch a sore throat.

262
01:17:42,302 --> 01:17:44,970
It's 28 degrees Celsius.

263
01:17:45,070 --> 01:17:48,733
That doesn't matter
if there's a draft.

264
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:52,365
-Mom, you interfere all the time.
-It's no good.

265
01:17:57,372 --> 01:17:58,572
For once in my life,

266
01:17:58,672 --> 01:18:01,592
I get to sit in a motorboat,
and that also gets fucked up.

267
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:04,267
-So?
-It doesn't matter.

268
01:18:04,367 --> 01:18:07,732
-It's fucked now anyway.
-You don't usually talk like that.

269
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:11,440
-I don't--
-I don't like it when you speak like that.

270
01:18:16,665 --> 01:18:17,918
I have sandwiches.

271
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,640
Zsolt, you should
at least put your hood on.

272
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:22,520
Mom!

273
01:18:24,037 --> 01:18:25,292
Is there salami in it?

274
01:18:28,468 --> 01:18:32,148
You said you wanted one with paté.

275
01:18:32,248 --> 01:18:36,322
-He wanted paté, right?
-I don't know, Mom. Maybe.

276
01:18:36,975 --> 01:18:41,052
-I especially went out to buy paté.
-OK, OK. Just asking.

277
01:18:42,052 --> 01:18:43,652
Can't I ask anything?

278
01:18:44,152 --> 01:18:46,152
-Paté is fine.
-OK, just eat it.

279
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:55,745
All right, please.

280
01:19:01,687 --> 01:19:04,150
-Tasty.
-You see?

281
01:19:05,193 --> 01:19:06,418
You asked for it.

282
01:20:34,783 --> 01:20:36,582
What do you think?

283
01:20:36,682 --> 01:20:40,567
<i>The whole message thing is so ridiculous.
Do you think this is even possible?</i>

284
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:42,650
<i>Get your dick out of my face!</i>

285
01:20:43,618 --> 01:20:47,037
<i>And the fuss about the packages.</i>

286
01:20:47,137 --> 01:20:49,337
<i>Mom says he sent two tops.
Then nothing.</i>

287
01:20:49,537 --> 01:20:51,537
I thought so.

288
01:20:51,637 --> 01:20:53,837
<i>-You know what was in them?</i>
-What?

289
01:20:53,937 --> 01:20:56,795
<i>-Underwear.</i>
-Really?

290
01:20:56,878 --> 01:20:58,547
<i>He heard the voice of God,</i>

291
01:20:58,647 --> 01:21:02,880
<i>so he went and sent underpants
with Disney patterns to his boys.</i>

292
01:21:04,578 --> 01:21:07,102
OK, fine,
he does have funny ideas...

293
01:21:08,102 --> 01:21:10,447
but look on the bright side of it.

294
01:21:11,347 --> 01:21:14,760
He isn't the mass murderer
we thought he was.

295
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:16,760
<i>Let's just wait and see.</i>

296
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:18,660
What?

297
01:21:19,088 --> 01:21:23,092
<i>Haven't you seen
the stuff I sent you?</i>

298
01:21:24,128 --> 01:21:26,793
He is innocent.
Totally. Innocent!

299
01:21:26,878 --> 01:21:29,672
<i>Do you know who I think
was fucking innocent? Me.</i>

300
01:21:29,757 --> 01:21:31,697
<i>And still I get to pay for it all.</i>

301
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:32,920
<i>I can't believe it!</i>

302
01:21:33,003 --> 01:21:37,867
All right, he dodged all the bullets
so far, took us down a notch.

303
01:21:38,708 --> 01:21:40,763
<i>Do you hear yourself at all?</i>

304
01:21:40,847 --> 01:21:43,907
It's easy for you because
you fell for the whole Muppet show,

305
01:21:43,990 --> 01:21:48,415
because you could live in his house
and you got to drive his car

306
01:21:48,538 --> 01:21:52,987
and fucking eat with him
in the evenings

307
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:55,310
and swim...

308
01:21:55,815 --> 01:21:56,993
You know what?

309
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:58,818
<i>-Fuck yourself.
-You know what?</i>

310
01:21:58,902 --> 01:22:00,502
<i>I'm already fucked big-time.</i>

311
01:26:51,370 --> 01:26:54,438
Are you there?! I'll never
pick you up at the pool again.

312
01:26:54,523 --> 01:26:57,958
Tell him I didn't want
to hurt Dad. Hear me?

313
01:26:58,043 --> 01:26:59,983
I just wanted...

314
01:27:00,067 --> 01:27:02,517
And Dad will never
speak to you ever again.

315
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:04,600
Tell him
I didn't want to hurt Dad.

316
01:27:05,168 --> 01:27:09,312
I just wanted them to know
that nothing meets their expectations.

317
01:27:09,735 --> 01:27:12,067
Hear me? Tell him
I didn't want to hurt Dad.

318
01:27:12,152 --> 01:27:14,727
Ever again.
You screwed up, little brother.

319
01:27:14,812 --> 01:27:17,498
Don't hang up the phone
when I'm talking with you.

320
01:28:31,638 --> 01:28:36,192
<i>Day 13.316, log entry 8814.</i>

321
01:28:36,275 --> 01:28:38,275
<i>A message to the Galactic Council.</i>

322
01:28:38,837 --> 01:28:40,498
<i>I didn't sign up for this.</i>

323
01:28:41,452 --> 01:28:42,543
<i>At last we got it.</i>

324
01:28:42,767 --> 01:28:45,893
<i>At last we found
who we had always been searching for.</i>

325
01:28:46,198 --> 01:28:48,047
<i>I don't want to take part in this.</i>

326
01:28:48,610 --> 01:28:51,612
<i>I came to establish a connection
with a foreign civilization.</i>

327
01:28:51,695 --> 01:28:54,193
<i>Why should we use aggression
and destroy this planet</i>

328
01:28:54,277 --> 01:28:56,802
<i>if we are able to explore it first?</i>

329
01:28:56,885 --> 01:29:01,193
<i>Just because their reactions
are unsuitable to our values?</i>

330
01:29:01,417 --> 01:29:03,057
<i>Somebody do something!</i>

331
01:29:03,142 --> 01:29:04,942
<i>Because this is a genocide.</i>

332
01:29:05,065 --> 01:29:07,065
<i>With empty contemplations.</i>

333
01:29:07,288 --> 01:29:08,917
<i>There is no excuse for this.</i>

334
01:34:24,953 --> 01:34:26,007
Would you let me in?

335
01:36:30,392 --> 01:36:31,858
Oh, you are so stupid!

336
01:36:36,132 --> 01:36:37,425
It is good to see you.

337
01:36:53,283 --> 01:36:54,863
I will miss you, Dad.
