00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,799
-Here you go, miss.
-Thank you.

1
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,566
Step through, please.

2
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:55,007
Open your laptop, please.

3
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,121
l guess people take their computers
with them everywhere nowadays.

4
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,688
Security blanket.

5
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,358
Lucky blanket.

6
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,394
Next.

7
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,840
Wow, even answer your own door,
senator.

8
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,037
-l'm impressed.
-Front-porch mentality.

9
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,876
l like to know who's visiting.

10
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:34,451
Plus, my secretary, Laura,
just stepped out for an early lunch.

11
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:37,184
Caroline Eldridge from
Family First is visiting.

12
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,188
You're early. l like that. Come in.

13
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,859
-Let's take the sofa.
-Okay.

14
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,969
Hope you don't mind if l take
this out.

15
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,437
My hard drive is now officially
my only source of memory...

16
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:59,408
...and l wanna get all those
old-fashioned values down accurately.

17
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:02,775
Now, as you know, we're putting
together our Family First brochure...

18
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,746
...and we've got pictures
that we could use captions for.

19
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,410
-Fire away.
-Okay.

20
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,488
Let's start with this one.

21
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:15,593
That's me and some of the staff
in the Gulf of Mexico after Katrina.

22
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,187
Heartbreaking stuff.

23
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,096
Okay.

24
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,824
Let's call this:

25
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,560
''Senator Sachs and staff
lend a hand in hurricane relief.

26
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,771
-Good.
-How about that?

27
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,534
That's one of my former interns...

28
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,439
...Josh.

29
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,671
Must have been taken his last day
of work.

30
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,850
Let's call it:

31
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:42,414
-''lntern program a success.''
-Okay.

32
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,722
Met a lot of good kids that way.

33
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,117
l'll bet.

34
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,923
How about that one?

35
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,757
Wait, let me try.

36
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:57,027
''lntern program has fringe benefits''?

37
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,394
Let's see.

38
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:03,767
-Let's call it ''extramarital Sachs.''
-Who are you?

39
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:07,140
Someone who thinks it's a bit
hypocritical for the past two years...

40
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,111
...you've tried to limit the civil rights
of gay individuals...

41
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,409
-...while being gay yourself.
-Lady--

42
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,985
Preach family first
as if there's one kind of family.

43
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,988
l don't know what you think you got
but let me explain something to you.

44
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:22,593
What l've got is a signed statement
by Josh.

45
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:26,629
We've got canceled checks and
he's ready to turn over the love notes.

46
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,064
-Laura.
-Out to lunch, remember?

47
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,033
lt's gonna be your word against his.

48
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,672
We're running his tomorrow.

49
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,240
l work for David Shane
at the <i>New York Courier.</i>

50
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,501
Jesus Christ.

51
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,474
Josh came to us seven
months ago...

52
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,739
...and thought we'd be interested
in knowing...

53
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,009
...that he's not the only handsome
skeleton in your closet.

54
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,779
So we thought we'd give you
an opportunity to respond.

55
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,548
Anything you want.

56
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:57,592
l will give you anything
that you want.

57
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,287
Anything.

58
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,669
<i>I will give</i>-- <i>I will give you anything</i>
<i>that you want.</i>

59
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:05,997
<i>Anything.</i>

60
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:07,866
You just did, senator.

61
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,669
You just did.

62
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,975
Tell me you got that, Miles.

63
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:14,874
Please tell me you got that.

64
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,343
l got it, you psychopath.

65
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,483
Jump on the shuttle,
get down to the paper.

66
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:21,176
And we'll get fantastically,
exceedingly drunk.

67
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,957
<i>I will give you anything that you want,</i>
<i>anything.</i>

68
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,718
One more time.

69
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,395
You transmitted from D.C.

70
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:31,824
And recorded in New York.

71
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,828
-Go to Legal. lt'll check.
-l intend to.

72
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,126
Also we need to clear
the quote from the intern.

73
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,634
He's at home waiting for the call.

74
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,433
This your headline, David Shane?

75
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,574
Yep.

76
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:45,801
We'll be at Chumley's...

77
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,812
...ordering copious amounts of drinks
on this paper.

78
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,017
God, l love this job.

79
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,209
Hey, hey. To David Shane.

80
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,980
May this article bring you
all the prizes you deserve.

81
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,684
Fame, alcoholism,
rehab, relapse, rehab.

82
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:04,556
When you win the Pulitzer,
don't forget the little people.

83
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,494
Oh, fuck the little people.

84
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,464
Hey, you're empty. You buy, l fly.

85
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,872
Excuse me, sweetheart.

86
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,678
Careful, Ro. Next round he might aim
for your lips.

87
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,907
Mr. Arvis Narron.

88
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:30,152
What kind of name is Arvis?

89
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,046
Family name.

90
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,857
Story's been pulled, Ro.

91
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,622
Somebody got to your intern.
Made him clam up.

92
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:41,800
My guess is somebody with lots
of zeroes.

93
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,796
What?

94
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:45,465
Well...

95
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:47,396
...l'm just gonna go call him.

96
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,072
You'll get his lawyer,
just like we did.

97
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,972
Do you know l've been working
on this story for six months?

98
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,146
Six.

99
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,542
Take a couple weeks off.
You've earned the break.

100
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,546
l'm gonna go back to the office
right now.

101
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,651
This guy's got a stack
of interns, trust me.

102
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:04,254
Kolski wants you to take
a couple of weeks off.

103
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,481
That's not a request.

104
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,488
Okay, wait, hold up.

105
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,254
Please tell me...

106
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:12,625
...you're not saying because the paper
endorsed Sachs' last campaign...

107
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,026
...that he's off-limits now.

108
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,599
Please tell me that is not
what you're saying.

109
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,634
-What's up, Narron?
-Get this, Miles.

110
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,636
Tomorrow's headline:
''Free Press Dead.''

111
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,571
Kolski wants to shut me down
because l went after the senator.

112
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,244
Does it ever get to you, Narron?

113
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:30,382
The idea that we're supposed to be
reporting the news not covering it up?

114
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,211
Like we couldn't show the dead
bodies coming back from lraq.

115
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,444
lf you don't see it,
means it never happened.

116
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:36,644
Your source ran dry.

117
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,290
-My source didn't run dry.
-You can't try to cover up--

118
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,427
My source was paid off.

119
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,596
This is a good story, Narron.

120
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,625
The story's dead.

121
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,134
Classic.

122
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:54,033
Powerful men
protecting powerful men.

123
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,003
l backed you when you wanted
anonymity...

124
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,677
...when you wanted to write under
an old boy's name.

125
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:02,507
This is not the first time you shut me
down but this is definitely the last.

126
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:08,312
So you tell Kolski keep his paid
vacation because l fucking quit.

127
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,021
Taxi. Hey.

128
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,071
Rowena?

129
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,640
Rowena. Wait up.

130
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,052
Wait. Wait.

131
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,688
Fuck.

132
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,488
-Rowena.
-Grace. Shit, you scared me.

133
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,394
You didn't return my phone calls.

134
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,627
Well, yeah, l've been pretty busy
working out of town.

135
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:03,832
Oh, yeah. The Senator Sachs scandal.
Don't worry. l didn't tell anyone.

136
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,977
Besides, l got a better story for you.

137
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,408
lt's about Harrison Hill.

138
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:11,242
-Come on.
-We met online.

139
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:12,982
We did.

140
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:16,245
He was giving a Q and A, l e-mailed
him and told him how great it was.

141
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:19,856
You know, stroke a man's dick
and you get him for one night.

142
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,656
Stroke his ego,
you get him for life, huh?

143
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,764
Yeah, we sort of struck up
a friendship online...

144
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,695
...but l could tell that he liked me.

145
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,234
So l decided to come to New York
and accidentally bump into him.

146
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,804
l knew about his fundraiser,
so l bought a ticket...

147
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:39,307
...walked right up to him and said,
''Harrison, it's Fast Filly.'''

148
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,972
l thought he was gonna be angry.

149
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:46,413
But instead, he's turned on by it.

150
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,644
He likes the balls of it.

151
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,719
''Stick around,'' he says.

152
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,017
Couple hours later, we're doing it
in his Beemer, his hotel suite.

153
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:55,625
He keeps one, creep.

154
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,524
What happened to Chuck?

155
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,460
We're fighting more
than we're fucking.

156
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,928
Anyway, l get back to Philly,
our online stuff gets pretty hot.

157
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,298
He misses me.

158
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,497
l mean, he practically begs me
to move here.

159
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,609
So l check out apartments
and agencies...

160
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,302
...and l wanna tell him, you know,
l'm really excited.

161
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:18,472
But suddenly,
l can't get ahold of him.

162
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:23,047
l mean, l sent him a million e-mails
and he just cuts me off.

163
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,917
Cold. Fucker.

164
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,525
l know where Hill lives.

165
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,191
l've seen his Armani wife.

166
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,991
He has no idea what l can do
to him.

167
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,965
What is it you want from me this time,
Grace?

168
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:42,299
Actions have consequences, Ro.

169
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,373
You can't just forget people.

170
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,808
Bury them and pretend like
they never existed.

171
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,982
lt always comes back to haunt you.

172
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:54,175
l wonder what Hill would think if David
Shane publishes a few of his e-mails?

173
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,446
l'm sure the wife would find them
interesting.

174
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,916
Take them. Read them.

175
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:04,324
Because l'm about an inch away
from ringing this guy's doorbell.

176
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,521
Regards to your mother.

177
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:34,519
l know where Hill lives.
l've seen his Armani wife.

178
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,061
He has no idea what
l can do to him.

179
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,894
<i>To David Shane. May this article</i>
<i>bring you all the prizes you deserve.</i>

180
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:47,561
And when you win the Pulitzer,
don't forget the little people.

181
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,004
<i>Here comes the beep.</i>
<i>You know what to do.</i>

182
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,446
<i>Hey, Ro, it's Miles, again.</i>
<i>I've been calling for like a week.</i>

183
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:31,844
<i>Are you looking for a job?</i>
<i>If you are, come on, take me with you.</i>

184
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,882
<i>Guess what,</i>
<i>my sister had a boy, Fletcher.</i>

185
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,214
<i>How cool is that? I fly home</i>
<i>in an hour. Call me later, please.</i>

186
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,189
<i>I hate Narron too.</i>
<i>Narron's a dick. Bye.</i>

187
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,965
<i>Here comes the beep.</i>
<i>You know what to do.</i>

188
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,735
<i>Ro, it's Elizabeth Clayton.</i>
<i>Grace's mother.</i>

189
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,338
-<i>I need help.</i>
-Elizabeth.

190
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,974
-Hi.
-<i>Ro? It's Grace.</i>

191
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:00,236
<i>She's missing. They started calling</i>
<i>from her agency last week.</i>

192
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,847
<i>She goes to New York a lot and</i>
<i>I thought maybe she contacted you.</i>

193
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,677
<i>It's just that I filed</i>
<i>a missing person's report.</i>

194
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,251
<i>A woman drowned in New York.</i>

195
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,446
-<i>They asked for dental records.</i>
-Elizabeth, hang on a second.

196
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,625
-l saw Grace last week.
-<i>Oh, thank God.</i>

197
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:17,125
-Spare yourself a trip.
-<i>But if it is</i>-- <i>If I weren't there</i>--

198
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:21,789
<i>I know half the people at the city</i>
<i>morgue. This is not Grace, I promise.</i>

199
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,094
<i>I'll call you when I get back.</i>

200
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:28,033
Hi, l'm Rowena Price.
Here to lD a body.

201
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:32,868
Whoever did this tried to weigh
the body down.

202
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,443
Amateur move.

203
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,377
-Why is that?
-Didn't work.

204
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,280
Fair warning.

205
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,776
This isn't pretty.

206
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,753
We're guessing an anchor...

207
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,985
...or some sharp metal debris
ripped off the face and neck.

208
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:53,757
So we're hoping that you could
identify something else.

209
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,159
She has a birthmark, scars...

210
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,494
...and it looks like a tattoo--

211
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,465
Hi, Rowena.

212
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:33,837
Do you wanna play?

213
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,071
Well, are you coming?

214
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,346
<i>Let's go around back.</i>

215
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,774
l live up there.

216
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:59,088
<i>You do everything you can to protect</i>
<i>your children.</i>

217
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,262
<i>Right schools, right opportunities.</i>

218
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,899
<i>But it's all an illusion.</i>
<i>Nobody's safe.</i>

219
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,129
Who would do this to my daughter?

220
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,330
We're gonna find out, Mrs. Clayton.

221
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,304
Do you mind if l ask you
a few questions?

222
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,206
-Can you excuse us?
-No. She's a friend of the family.

223
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,976
Do you know if your daughter
had been seeing anyone?

224
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,344
Yeah.

225
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,213
Chuck. Chuck Freeman.

226
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,945
But they'd been having trouble.

227
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,953
Yeah, she told me that too.

228
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,955
l ran into her on the subway
last week...

229
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,628
...she mentioned
that they were having fights.

230
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,763
Was that the last time you saw her?

231
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,057
Yeah.

232
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:38,202
l mean, l tried to call her, but she was
in the middle of something, and....

233
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,405
Well, l wish now l had tried
a little bit harder.

234
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,767
Oh, l know, honey.

235
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:46,138
They knew each other
since they were kids.

236
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:50,580
You were so close, you two,
especially after your father--

237
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,478
Yeah, l know.

238
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:56,246
Well, you were always so good to me
and my mother.

239
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,422
So was Grace.

240
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,059
Mrs. Clayton, we're gonna need you
to sign some papers downstairs.

241
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,526
Certainly.

242
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,632
l'll be just a minute.

243
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,061
Ro.

244
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,203
You know, Grace was so proud
of you.

245
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:20,167
She saved all your articles.
She bragged about you.

246
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,473
How did she know
that l was David Shane?

247
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,116
l assumed you told her.

248
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,917
l probably did.

249
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,154
Thank you.

250
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,795
The police are gonna find out
exactly who did this.

251
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,656
l'll make sure they do.

252
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,263
Thank you, honey.

253
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,672
Hey.

254
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,172
Hey, Miles.

255
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,147
Let me get the key.

256
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,579
l'm usually a key-above-the-door
kind of guy.

257
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,855
-Hey, Miles.
-Yeah.

258
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,048
When was the last time
you saw Grace?

259
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,919
Oh, God, you know me
and dates, l--

260
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,996
All right, well, roughly. A week?

261
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,134
A month? A year?
Five years? What?

262
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,634
Yeah, something like that. Why?

263
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,772
Because.

264
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,568
Just because l cut somebody out
of my life...

265
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:28,008
...doesn't mean l expect you
to cut them out of yours.

266
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,410
-Well, maybe you do.
-All right, maybe l do.

267
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,645
-Why you got to keep it a secret?
-We exchanged e-mails...

268
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:38,448
...a couple times. l was only nice to
her because she was a friend of yours.

269
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,750
So you told her l was David Shane?

270
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,090
Yeah. Busted.

271
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,730
Could you be serious for five
fucking minutes?

272
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:50,026
l'll bet you told her
about Senator Sachs too, didn't you?

273
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,965
l stopped associating with her
when she fucked your boyfriend.

274
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,139
Ask him who told her.

275
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:57,433
You need to stay in your own
fucking lane, that's what l think.

276
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:00,942
You just better leave Cam out of it.
l mean it, Miles.

277
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:04,081
Ro, l'm sorry.
l was being insensitive.

278
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,251
Ro, l'm sorry.

279
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:10,252
lt's just-- l was the one
who was left picking up the pieces...

280
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:13,789
...after Grace and Cameron
tore you apart and l-- And l--

281
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:21,232
Yeah. So, what do the police say?

282
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:25,267
They're chasing a lead on some guy
she was dating in Philly.

283
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,671
But l have another idea.

284
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:28,999
Why's that?

285
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,005
Because l saw Grace last week.

286
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,242
Oh, l'm the one
who's keeping secrets?

287
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,747
She wanted me to chase down
Harrison Hill.

288
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,385
Harrison Hill, Harrison Hill?

289
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,953
Yes, that Harrison Hill.
Here, take a look at this.

290
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,021
She was threatening
to go to his wife.

291
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,852
Apparently, they met online
in July...

292
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,654
...and had one hell of a weekend
in September.

293
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,956
l mean, that's assuming
he is ADEX.

294
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,154
-Wait. Who? Who?
-ADEX.

295
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,698
The guy she's been e-mailing,
ADEX.

296
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,166
l mean, it tracks.
Harrison Hill owns...

297
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:02,829
...the biggest ad agency
in New York City?

298
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:07,876
''l'm gonna fuck you so hard,
l'm gonna split you in half.''

299
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,681
Oh, my.

300
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,214
Oh, my God.

301
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:21,321
Wait a minute, Ro.
This is not a story.

302
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:26,624
Miles, l would love, love, love to get
my hands on the rest of these e-mails.

303
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,165
Because the way l see it, Grace was
fucking Hill, he dumped her...

304
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:33,566
...she got pissed, threatened to go
to the wife, and she wound up dead.

305
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:34,898
l mean, come on.

306
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,200
-lt's simple, that's it.
-This is Harrison Hill.

307
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,570
lf he wanted somebody dead,
he won't do it hims--

308
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,770
-That's just the first of all.
-She was stalking the guy.

309
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:46,542
She sent him a million e-mails.
She probably even went to his house.

310
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,083
Who knows?

311
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:51,654
All it takes to commit a murder...

312
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,520
...are the right ingredients
at the right time.

313
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,863
Son of a bitch.

314
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,533
-<i>Hey, where are you?</i>
-G.W. Bridge.

315
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,204
Why? What's up?

316
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:10,102
l got into Grace's Hotmail account.
lt's her main one.

317
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,504
There's a shitload of guys in there,
by the way.

318
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,201
But none of them are ADEX.

319
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,404
But that's not the account
l gave you, Miles.

320
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:20,779
Well, hold on. And then l looked at her
other account, FastFilly @iol.com...

321
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:24,683
...and guess who's all up in her box?
ADEX. Ro.

322
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,624
-Yeah?
-You got to read some of this shit.

323
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,384
<i>I wanna read it all, Miles.</i>

324
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,155
Okay. So, l'm gonna bring over
everything after work.

325
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,197
And, Ro, we still don't know
that ADEX is Hill.

326
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,698
And we still don't know
that he's not.

327
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:39,103
Yeah.

328
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,605
Hey, your dinner's getting warm.

329
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,051
Hold it.

330
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:33,421
Can l just say for the record, wow.

331
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:40,092
Can l also say that's just a ridiculous
outfit to be wearing for takeout?

332
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,267
Well, l didn't know
you were bringing takeout.

333
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,560
Well, l didn't know you had a date.

334
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:47,600
-Oh, God.
-Who's the...?

335
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,001
Who's the lucky guy?

336
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,139
Can we just look at the e-mails,
please?

337
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,438
Sure. Yeah. Here, here.
Have a seat.

338
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:57,647
Okay.

339
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,450
So yeah.

340
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:08,451
You told me that Grace wanted you
to threaten Hill.

341
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,391
Well, she was doing it without you
for a while. Listen. This, this--

342
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:15,760
This e-mail's a week old
and it's her last one.

343
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,492
''Harrison, if you don't,'' capital,
''pay attention to me...

344
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,968
...you're going to,'' capital,
''pay the price.

345
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,801
l'm in the city
and l know your wife's away.

346
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,376
Meet with me now,
or l'll meet with her later.''

347
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:30,946
So Grace knew that the wife
was out of town.

348
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:33,811
You're going under the assumption
that Grace actually knew...

349
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,214
...what she was talking about,
which is a mistake.

350
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,616
By the way, even though she calls
ADEX Harrison...

351
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:42,157
...it doesn't prove that it's Harrison
Hill. lt's not proof enough to print.

352
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,386
Okay. So how do we prove it?

353
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,291
Well, technically we can't prove it...

354
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,693
...but if we can get ADEX
to send us an e-mail...

355
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,893
...l can tail it, jimmy the lock, and then
take a closer look into his account.

356
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:56,866
You are amazing.

357
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,102
l love you, man.

358
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:03,376
This is just such an obstruction
of justice.

359
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:06,483
No, no, no.
This is the pursuit of justice.

360
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,347
l'll make you a deal.
We get anything concrete on Hill...

361
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,114
...we'll go to the cops
and to Narron on the same day.

362
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,189
They get their man.
We get our story.

363
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,088
But even if ADEX turns out
to be Hill...

364
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:18,592
...it's not a crime to chat nor cheat.

365
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:22,198
But it is a crime to be walking out
on a feast like this in that outfit.

366
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,426
And yet, l have to because l'm late.

367
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:26,831
So you finish up.
l'll see you tomorrow.

368
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,268
Shut the door. lt locks by itself.

369
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:31,203
Have fun.

370
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,242
Harrison Hill.

371
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:45,550
Oh, there you are.

372
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,762
Cam.

373
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:00,995
-Oh, Cam.
-Come here.

374
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,606
-You are naughty.
-Come on.

375
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,348
Come here.

376
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,011
Oh, yeah.

377
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,587
Yeah.

378
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,996
-You like that?
-Yes, baby.

379
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,801
Oh, come on. Say it.

380
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:45,142
Yeah, oh, yeah.

381
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,318
You like it? You like that?

382
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,885
Yeah, good.

383
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,757
l need to get closer to Hill.

384
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,988
<i>Hello, Miles. How are you?</i>
<i>Fine. You? Thanks.</i>

385
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:01,927
Hello, Miles. How are you?
Fine. You?

386
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,794
Okay, l need to get closer to Hill.

387
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,629
Close as you got to Cam last night?

388
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,465
lt's a little soon to be going
on dates with Grace's ex.

389
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,038
Oh, l'm sorry, your ex.

390
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:11,675
Are you fucking spying on me now?

391
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,077
<i>No. A friend of mine saw you</i>
<i>two last night.</i>

392
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,644
<i>And he said it looked friendly.</i>

393
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,280
What? You get him by default?

394
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:20,849
Well, not that l owe you or
your friend an explanation.

395
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:23,577
l wanted to see Cam. Somebody
had to tell him about Grace.

396
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:25,983
Well, l guess we all
grieve differently.

397
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,716
You know what, Miles? Forget it.

398
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,054
lf you don't wanna help me,
Terry wouldn't mind.

399
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,821
He's been dying to get
into research.

400
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,761
Oh, Terry couldn't find his ass
with both hands and his ass.

401
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:39,028
<i>All right, fine, fine, fine.</i>
<i>I'll play nice.</i>

402
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,266
Okay. Good.

403
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,702
While you look around
in cyberspace...

404
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,104
...l need to be looking around
at my new job...

405
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,506
...that you, clever friend,
are going to get me.

406
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,408
Oh, God love you.

407
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:53,277
Something temporary.
Easy in, easy out. Can you do that?

408
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:56,010
Does a bear shit in the woods?
H2A's got a blade server...

409
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:59,213
...that gives more entry points
than a college girl at Mardi Gras.

410
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,915
l'll access the needs list they send
to temp agencies.

411
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,186
Shouldn't be too hard.
There's always openings.

412
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,024
-And, hey, wear something sexy.
-What?

413
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,358
You need to bait the hook.

414
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,663
Just make sure l'm working for Hill.

415
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,895
<i>Yeah, your new name</i>
<i>will be Katherine Pogue.</i>

416
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,800
<i>I choose my own names.</i>

417
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:19,067
<i>Well, tough. I had a crush on a girl</i>
<i>in high school named Katherine.</i>

418
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,710
<i>It's an homage.</i>

419
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,403
-Going to H2A.
-H2A.

420
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:26,981
<i>Hill's a Jersey native who slipped</i>
<i>and fell into a big pile of money...</i>

421
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:30,120
-<i>...when he married</i>--
-<i>Mia Rheinhart Hill.</i>

422
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,689
<i>She's also the daughter of Max</i>
<i>Rheinhart, principal owner of H2A.</i>

423
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,120
-There you go.
-Thank you.

424
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,522
Now, if you'll follow me.

425
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,997
<i>Hard to separate a man</i>
<i>from his wife's money.</i>

426
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,259
<i>Money is the root of all evil, Miles.</i>

427
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:47,033
<i>Check your scriptures.</i>

428
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:50,036
<i>Love of money is the root of all evil,</i>
<i>Ro.</i>

429
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:51,907
<i>Love.</i>

430
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,708
We have a new temp.
Her name is Katherine Pogue.

431
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,176
-Hi.
-Hi.

432
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:59,311
Thank you. l'll show you
to your desk.

433
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,479
And press 9 to get out,
3 to reach me.

434
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:05,122
l'll be right across from you. You
shouldn't have a problem finding me.

435
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:14,031
Katherine, we need a coffee setup
in Conference Room A.

436
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:15,995
-Will l be working for Mr. Hill?
-No.

437
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:18,567
l'm working for Mr. Hill.
You're working for me.

438
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,604
And you'd better roll up your sleeves.
We are short-staffed this week.

439
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:30,181
Sensational, Harrison. Really.

440
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:31,679
Spectacular.

441
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:35,751
l hear you're thinking about opening
in Amsterdam, by the way.

442
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:39,446
-Yes, we did. ln April.
-Really?

443
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,647
Excuse me, Mr. Hill.

444
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:43,726
Mr. Kirschenbaum's car is downstairs
and your 2:00 is waiting.

445
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:45,862
Thanks, Esmeralda.

446
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,528
-l'll walk you out, Jon.
-Great. Thanks.

447
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:51,998
You're doing well.
l'm very proud of you.

448
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,266
l couldn't have done it without you.
l learned from the best.

449
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,202
-l appreciate it.
-Thanks for coming by.

450
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,536
Listen, this is probably
just bullshit...

451
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:04,010
...but one of my guys heard that a
couple of your execs were in Canton...

452
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:06,376
...sniffing around
my Reebok account.

453
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,984
lf you're sure it's bullshit,
why are you asking me?

454
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,652
Because they heard about it
from inside your agency.

455
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:16,383
l just don't want you to make that kind
of mistake, Harrison.

456
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:19,461
l've been representing Reebok
for 1 1 years.

457
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:20,756
They're my main account.

458
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:25,265
They're not gonna jump ship for your
smile and some downtown hype.

459
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:32,473
Eat or be eaten. Right, Jon?

460
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:34,542
lsn't that what you always told me?

461
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:37,112
Now, you left the Reebok account out
on the table.

462
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:41,046
lf l didn't pick it up, someone else
was going to and you know that.

463
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:44,847
Ten years ago you wouldn't have let
this happen. You fumbled the ball.

464
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,786
You really are that stupid.

465
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,426
Give my regards to Vanessa.

466
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,690
Esmeralda.

467
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:04,275
We have a leak to
Kirschenbaum and Bond.

468
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:08,207
l wanna find out who the fuck it is.
Right now.

469
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:11,976
Hold the door, please.

470
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:17,953
-Wait. Thank you.
-That was close.

471
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,319
Harrison, will you be attending
the Victoria's Secret meeting tonight?

472
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,724
l was hoping maybe l could catch
a ride.

473
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,229
-Yeah, l think l'll be going.
-Okay.

474
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,724
Keep the meter running.

475
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:20,116
We can go now.
7 4th and Broadway, please.

476
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,565
<i>Rowena.</i>

477
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,236
<i>Rowena.</i>

478
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,639
<i>Rowena.</i>

479
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,216
<i>Got you.</i>

480
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,323
You know how much
Daddy likes bath time.

481
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:19,501
We have a Victoria's Secret
party tonight.

482
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,908
-Good morning, Esmeralda.
-Good morning, Katherine.

483
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:26,948
Two hundred guests,
200 gift bags, too little time.

484
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:30,609
Five items per bag. Have fun.

485
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,201
-<i>Miles, what? I'm at work.</i>
-Well, it wasn't just a drowning.

486
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:47,293
She was poisoned.

487
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:49,735
She had a hole in her gut the size
of a fruit bowl.

488
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,602
Oh, come on.

489
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:54,403
No, that's a direct quote
from the examiner's office.

490
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,637
The killer also put it in her eyes...

491
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:59,382
<i>...which is weird.</i>

492
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:03,487
Ro, they haven't announced it yet...

493
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,586
...but Grace was pregnant.

494
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,116
<i>She was in her first trimester.</i>

495
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,852
Hello. l'm Gina.

496
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:15,032
-<i>Ro?</i>
-Katherine Pogue, are you in here?

497
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,292
Oh, there you are.

498
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:21,329
l could tell you Victoria's secret,
but then l'd have to kill you.

499
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:22,506
-Clever, huh?
-Yeah.

500
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,574
Mr. Hill came up with it for the
''Very Sexy Collection'' launch.

501
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,144
Very sexy.

502
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,143
And in a rainbow of colors.

503
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,314
Here, keep a few for the home fires.

504
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,577
l know a pretty girl like you
has a boyfriend.

505
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,948
-No.
-Girlfriend?

506
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:41,087
-Pets?
-No.

507
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:44,261
Well, we've got some
local talent here.

508
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:48,694
l'll say. What's up with Hill?
He's interesting.

509
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,358
Married.

510
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:54,004
Rumor is, and you didn't hear it
from me...

511
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:58,005
...he had a couple of interoffice flings
a few years back, led to lawsuits.

512
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,677
Paid a lot of money
to make them go away.

513
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:03,813
That's when he got his front girl
to run interference.

514
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:05,380
That would be Josie.

515
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:09,711
Or, if you get on her bad side,
Cujosie.

516
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:12,481
She's his gatekeeper.
His walking hard drive.

517
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,057
So he never forgets a name,
an account, an enemy.

518
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,626
No one gets to him now
without going through her.

519
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,991
Let me guess, he's done her too,
right?

520
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:23,667
Oh, no. No.

521
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:27,395
She'd be more interested in you than
in him, if you catch my heavy drift.

522
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,571
l think l do.

523
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,140
She's his watchdog, not his bitch.

524
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,471
-The guy's reformed, unfortunately.
-Right.

525
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:38,047
His wife's all over him.

526
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:40,183
She's got eyes in the back
of your head.

527
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:41,352
Trust me.

528
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:47,081
She finds him cheating,
she and her money are out the door.

529
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,690
See Jesse Drake over there?

530
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:51,760
He had this blond temp last fall
could melt butter.

531
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:54,693
Her name was Veronica.

532
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,867
One day, the boss's wife comes in...

533
00:33:57,068 --> 00:34:00,060
...sees Mr. H and Veronica talking
close over the Sparkletts...

534
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:03,069
...the next day the temp's toast.

535
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,401
The boy's been leashed.

536
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,046
But since l have it on good authority
he's into some very kinky shit.

537
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,511
He probably likes the tight collar.

538
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,419
l'd let him give me a little spank.

539
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,049
-Did l just say that out loud?
-You're sick.

540
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:30,466
Sorry.

541
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:32,764
l didn't mean to scare you.

542
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,335
Sorry.

543
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:37,770
You're Katherine, right?

544
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:40,967
And you're Harrison Hill, the boss.

545
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,069
Yes.

546
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:45,706
lt's good to be the boss.

547
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:47,650
Yeah.

548
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:51,811
So l'll see you at the party tonight,
Katherine.

549
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:25,784
Here we go.

550
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:37,291
On behalf of Victoria's Secret, l would
like to thank our very special angel...

551
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:41,131
...Harrison Hill, for making us
sexier than ever.

552
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:44,574
Harrison.

553
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:50,976
l have no idea how we could
possibly make...

554
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:53,343
...you look any sexier than you do
tonight, Heidi.

555
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,712
Thank you so very much.

556
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,357
l'd just like to raise a glass
to everyone at Victoria's Secret...

557
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:03,026
...and all my people at H2A...

558
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,195
...for making this
a successful campaign...

559
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:10,095
...a Very Sexy Collection
is H2A's most sexful--

560
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,833
Succsexf--

561
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,569
We did really good
with this campaign.

562
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:21,609
Happy Valentine's Day.
God bless you.

563
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,978
Thank you. Good night.

564
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,879
So is part of the torture the fact
we get to watch all this fun?

565
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:32,487
Are you kidding me?
We got the best seats in the house.

566
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,148
Okay, see the guy with the bad
combover standing by the statues?

567
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,419
Bob Milstein, Accounting.

568
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,290
He may look unlucky in love.

569
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:43,524
He recently nailed Kay Rolands,
Sales...

570
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:46,259
...the giant standing by the shrimp.

571
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:50,739
-Corporate America, ain't it grand?
-One big happy family, eh?

572
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:54,173
Who's the loud-laughing brunette?
The one that looks a little tipsy.

573
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:58,815
Oh, Bethany Lee, account manager.

574
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:02,611
Long legs, perfect teeth,
may they rot in hell.

575
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:05,649
A few years back
there was chatter...

576
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:09,758
...she and Mr. Hill were going over
more than just the company numbers.

577
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,019
-Really?
-Yeah.

578
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,027
But that was before the lawsuits,
before Cujosie...

579
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,962
...and before the wife
started paying attention.

580
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:20,626
Now it's all hugs and kisses
and they're going to fertility clinics.

581
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,601
l think her oven's on the fritz.

582
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:25,772
ls there anything you don't know,
Gina?

583
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,467
No.

584
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:30,642
l don't get it. Mrs. Hill is pretty.

585
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,475
l mean, she's really pretty.

586
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:37,586
Show me a beautiful woman, l'll show
you a man who's tired of fucking her.

587
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:40,655
-Nice, Gina.
-What? l've got brothers.

588
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:48,464
Hi.

589
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,361
Hey.

590
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,231
You're embarrassing him
and yourself.

591
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,566
Okay, l'll be better.

592
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:01,176
His wife is out there.

593
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:02,971
l'm sorry.

594
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,875
l'm sorry.

595
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,344
Here's money for a cab.

596
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:09,575
Come on.

597
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:14,417
-He'll call me, right?
-Good night, Bethany, good night.

598
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,304
l told you already, Narron, l quit.

599
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,502
l figured two weeks was enough
to let you cool off.

600
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,476
l gotta go.

601
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:41,184
l'm sorry about the senator, Ro,
but l can't lose you.

602
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:44,377
-David Shane is this paper's star.
-You don't bench a star, Narron.

603
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:47,489
There will always be powerful people
covering things up, Ro...

604
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:49,660
...at every paper, in every city.

605
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,124
lt's called editorializing
and it's a reality.

606
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:54,794
Don't give up
because one son of a bitch...

607
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,797
...pulled some strings at the paper
and silenced your source.

608
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,130
Rest up, come back...

609
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,899
...and nail the next son of a bitch.

610
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,541
Maybe.

611
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:10,873
So l set up your lOL account,
but you're gonna need a name.

612
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,608
How about Rocket?

613
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:16,184
That was my nickname
from college.

614
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:19,356
Are you sure you don't wanna be
''Hot Bitch on Wheels''?

615
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:25,957
No, l'm kidding.
All right, Rocket, Rocket, ''Rocketgirl.''

616
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:30,065
A little sexier than
DShane@NYCourier.com.

617
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:32,497
So l put ADEX...

618
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:38,835
...into your friends file
and as a little extra added bonus...

619
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:42,604
...your computer has a few things
to say. Listen, this is good.

620
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,214
<i>Miles is sexy.</i>

621
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,909
<i>Miles is sexy.</i>

622
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,419
-Translation?
-Let me guess.

623
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:53,749
Miles is sexy?

624
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:57,394
-You think so?
-And l need this, why?

625
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,028
Because it's fucking radical.

626
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,630
Every time you get an lM,
you'll have a voice to match.

627
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:04,357
l don't want my computer talking.
l don't want it saying:

628
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:07,162
-''Miles is sexy.''
-l'll just give an audio to Hill.

629
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:09,532
l sampled his voice
from some streaming video.

630
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,140
-You don't mind if Hill talks?
-Do l have a choice?

631
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:13,970
No.

632
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,146
So, what's he like up close
and personal?

633
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:24,412
Well, tell you one thing,
there's more to the guy than you think.

634
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,146
You should check out his offices.

635
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:27,619
Go online, take the tour.

636
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:30,419
You'll see. lt's outrageous.

637
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:34,260
Sick. Just what you'd like.

638
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:38,367
Oh, you know what, by the way,
l did find something out. Apparently...

639
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:42,027
...Hill has squashed a couple
of sexual harassment suits.

640
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,332
-Could you chase the money trail?
-Yeah, well...

641
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,567
...l guess he's a likely
candidate for that.

642
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:47,835
No, not really.

643
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:50,172
He's now got this gorgeous
Amazonian woman...

644
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:53,782
-...that does all the dirty work.
-Oh, really? ls she hot?

645
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:55,246
Yes.

646
00:40:55,453 --> 00:41:00,117
She's very hot.
She's also a lesbian.

647
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,019
Bastard.

648
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,928
All right, so seeing
that you're a chat-room virgin....

649
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,031
-Big deal, l'm a chat-room virgin.
-No, l think it's a compliment.

650
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:12,293
l think you should practice
online flirting.

651
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:16,366
-Why would l want to do that?
-Because you'll tell a perfect stranger...

652
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:20,169
...something you won't tell your best
friend. Especially if you're anonymous.

653
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:22,743
You should know that,
Mr. David Shane.

654
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:27,549
Oh, by the way, l got a dollar that
says Hill's not our guy.

655
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,951
We got a pregnant Grace,
threatening to go to the wife, right?

656
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:37,059
-Yeah.
-Okay, but meanwhile, the wife...

657
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:40,492
...is busy trying to haul Hill off
to a fertility clinic.

658
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:46,295
And let's not forget the most
important part, the wife is the money.

659
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,869
-Yeah.
-l don't know.

660
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,369
That's motive on a big stick.

661
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:52,337
-Motive on a big stick?
-That's what l said.

662
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:55,637
So l'll take your bet.

663
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,473
Game on.

664
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,351
<i>Welcome to chat.</i>

665
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:05,422
''Trublu?'' Okay.

666
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:08,615
<i>Welcome.</i>

667
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,751
''Haven't seen you around.''

668
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:15,359
New to this. Who are you?

669
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:21,004
Hello, Neil, l'm Tiffany.

670
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,973
Okay, Trublu, let's go.

671
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:36,418
How do you imagine me?

672
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,020
''Long blond hair, longer legs--''

673
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,555
Really close.

674
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,794
<i>Welcome.</i>

675
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:49,189
''When you said you were getting off,
l didn't know you meant literally.''

676
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,267
Leave me alone.

677
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:00,042

678
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:05,041
''l did on his--''

679
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:15,818
-Hello.
-Okay, look, this isn't funny.

680
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:19,223
-You're taking advantage of me.
-This is exactly what we talked about.

681
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,227
Once he responds,
l get past his firewall.

682
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,832
lt's the price of admission.

Oh, shit. He's on.

687
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,678
-There he is. Let me drive.
-<i>He's on, Miles, he's on.</i>

688
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,110
-Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Miles.
-Harrison--

689
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:41,477
-<i>What are you doing?</i>
-Nice to hear from you.

690
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:44,745
Miles, you're typing for me?

691
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,855
-lt's a riddle.
-<i>Miles. Stop it.</i>

692
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:49,287
-<i>Miles, stop it.</i>
-All right, fine. Fine. Fine.

693
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:52,155
l'm through the firewall into ADEX's
account. He's all yours.

694
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:55,623
Miles, you bastard.

<i>What color is your hair?</i>

698
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:13,577
Blond.

699
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:15,674
Dirty.

00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,673
<i>But you just warmed me up.</i>

708
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:39,843
Yeah. Don't blueball the guy.

709
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:43,775
''Yeah, Ro. Don't blueball the guy.''

-l'll be back. Bye.
-<i>Goodbye.</i>

711
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:55,318
Would you quit spying on me,
you fuck?

712
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,427
You are officially in the way
of how l work and l'm not having it.

-lt's Hill. We can prove it now.
-Don't send e-mails on my behalf.

00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:03,825
And do not speak for me in any way.

715
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,832
How about, ''Thank you, Miles,
for your subversive genius''?

716
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,597
Thank you. Bye.

00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:41,234
Morning.

723
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,702

l don't know. My life is kind of crazy.

742
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:33,450
One day just runs into the next.

00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:37,056
Heineken Amsterdam

744
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:39,957
We should start talking

Here, hold this, please.

752
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:01,509

Shit.

772
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:27,429
Does this phone call mean
l'm forgiven?

773
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:29,765
You've got once chance
to redeem yourself.

774
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:31,907
He wants a photo of Veronica.

775

My computer screen is frozen.
And Veronica's face is screen saver.

Nope.

00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,510
Not unless data entry turns you on.

817
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:28,183
You know what?
Surprisingly, it doesn't.

818

But seriously, how you doing?
