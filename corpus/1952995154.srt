You know why this reindeer isn't
up there with the rest of them.

80
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:31,102
Well, the town hires me

81
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,537
to put the decorations up
every Christmas.

82
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:35,706
Guess that makes me
the local expert.

83
00:04:35,707 --> 00:04:37,876
So you think you could
tell me about it?

84
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:41,045
Sure.

85
00:04:41,046 --> 00:04:43,514
But if I tell you the Prancer
story, that makes you

00:04:43,515 --> 00:04:45,483
the local expert from now on deal?

Well, I guess it was
about ten years ago.

00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:52,790
This little girl about your size

91
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,426
found this wounded deer
on the outside of town.

92
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:57,161
She thought it was
one of Santa's.

93
00:04:57,162 --> 00:04:58,529
Here, hold this, will you?

94
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,464
Why'd she think that?

95
00:05:02,434 --> 00:05:03,601
I don't know.

96
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:05,036
Uh, maybe because

97
00:05:05,037 --> 00:05:07,505
her and her family were
going through a tough time,

98
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:09,908
and she probably figured
if the deer was Santa's,

99
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,075
it could help her out.

100
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:13,577
Anyway,

101
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:15,246
she gets this deer healthy,

102
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:19,050
takes it out to antler Ridge
on Christmas Eve.

103
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:21,819
Then guess what happens.

104
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,455
Santa comes along,
deer takes off.

105
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:25,456

That's the word.

109
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,729
So every Christmas since then,

110
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,233
when I put Santa and his
reindeer across main street,

111
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,600
Prancer's missing.

112
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:38,836
Then on Christmas Eve,
we have a big ceremony

113
00:05:38,837 --> 00:05:40,771
where Prancer’s reunited
with the team.

114
00:05:40,772 --> 00:05:41,772
That's cool.

115
00:05:41,773 --> 00:05:42,907

116
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:44,842
See, it just makes
more work for me,

117
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:46,510
'cause I put all the deer up,

118
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:49,147
then they gotta put this one up
on Christmas Eve,

119
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,015

00:23:25,102 --> 00:23:27,237
Coast is clear, Prancer.

374
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:29,606
Kitchen is open for business.

375
00:23:29,607 --> 00:23:31,975
[grunts]

376
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,448
What's the matter with you, Prancer?

377
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:41,251
This is some of the best food
in the world.

378
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:45,722
I could live on this stuff.

379
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:47,991
I don't know about you,

380
00:23:47,992 --> 00:23:50,561
But I'm having breakfast.

381
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,039
[sloppy slurping noises]

382
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,875
Prancer!

383
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:05,876
Slurrp!

384
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,444
Milk.

385
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,345
Of course.

386
00:24:09,346 --> 00:24:12,148
Little reindeer like milk.

387
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,365
Hi, there.

388
00:24:29,366 --> 00:24:31,702
I don't know if you remember me.

389
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:33,070
Hopefully, your owner doesn't.

390
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:35,271
(old man Richards)
What are you doing here?

391
00:24:35,272 --> 00:24:36,272
Whoa.

392
00:24:36,273 --> 00:24:38,441
- I just
- you sellin' magazines?

393
00:24:38,442 --> 00:24:40,043
No, I'm.

394
00:24:40,044 --> 00:24:42,512
Are you selling Christmas candy?
I don't want any.

395
00:24:42,513 --> 00:24:43,513
I'm not.

396
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,584
Wait a second.

397
00:24:47,585 --> 00:24:48,585
I know you.

398
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:49,720
That was a mistake.

399
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:50,721
I was in a hurry.

400
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,255
This is private property.

401
00:24:52,256 --> 00:24:53,724
I know, but

402
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:55,826
I want you to hit the road, Junior.

403
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,827
Come on.

404
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,261
I just want some milk.

405
00:25:00,898 --> 00:25:01,832
Milk?

406
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,100
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

407
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:04,534
I need a lot of it.

408
00:25:04,535 --> 00:25:06,603
I'm willing to work for it.

409
00:25:06,604 --> 00:25:10,240
What makes you think
I have a lot of milk?

410
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:12,442
You have a cow, don't you?

411
00:25:12,443 --> 00:25:14,577
Yeah, but she hasn't
given milk in years.

412
00:25:14,578 --> 00:25:15,578
Why not?

413
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:16,847
Because she's too old.

414
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:20,684
Well, can I try?

415
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,621
[chuckles]

416
00:25:24,622 --> 00:25:25,989
Yeah.

417
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,991
Yeah, you can try.

418
00:25:27,992 --> 00:25:30,861
Have fun, son.

419
00:25:44,441 --> 00:25:46,143
Charlie!

420
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,778
What'd you do with all the milk?

421
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:48,779
[knocking]

422
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:53,950
What the?

423
00:25:53,951 --> 00:25:55,285
(Charlie) Listen.

424
00:25:55,286 --> 00:25:57,954
<i>I know we got off</i>
<i>to a bad start yesterday.</i>

425
00:25:57,955 --> 00:26:00,123
<i>But you have to</i>
<i>help me out here.</i>

426
00:26:00,124 --> 00:26:02,793
I have Prancer’s kid at home.

427
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,895
You know, Prancer?

428
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,563
One of Santa's reindeer?

429
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:07,698
[snorts]

430
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,399
I'm serious about this.

431
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,202
The little guy drinks a ton of milk.

432
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:15,105
If you can just give me some,
it'd be great.

433
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:16,472
[moos]

434
00:26:16,473 --> 00:26:19,342
Oh.

435
00:26:19,343 --> 00:26:20,711
Come on.

436
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,179
What do you say?

437
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,380
Give it up for Santa.

438
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,696
[panting]

439
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:43,033
Ah, give up?

440
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,234
No, sir.

441
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:45,668
I need another bucket.

442
00:26:48,372 --> 00:26:51,274
[milk squirting]

443
00:26:51,275 --> 00:26:54,144
<i>(old man Richards) How...</i>

444
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:56,546
How did you?

445
00:26:56,547 --> 00:26:59,649
I just gave her a pep talk.

446
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,984
Pep talk?

447
00:27:00,985 --> 00:27:02,219
Yes, sir.

448
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,654
Told her that I needed it for Santa.

449
00:27:04,655 --> 00:27:06,522
What are you talking about?

450
00:27:06,523 --> 00:27:09,826
Don't you put milk out for Santa?

451
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:15,165
Not anymore.

452
00:27:19,036 --> 00:27:20,336
Something wrong?

453
00:27:20,337 --> 00:27:21,905
<i>I don't recognize you.</i>

454
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:24,440
I know most people in town,

455
00:27:24,441 --> 00:27:26,243
but you, I

456
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,879
I don't recognize.

457
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,413
I just moved here.

458
00:27:30,414 --> 00:27:33,083
My mom and dad got a divorce
a few years ago.

459
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:35,551
Hasn't been going all that well.

460
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,920
My mom's worried about me,

461
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:40,390
because I don't have any friends.

462
00:27:40,391 --> 00:27:42,325
She and my brother fight
all the time.

463
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:43,960
You ever fight with your kids?

464
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:45,829
What?

465
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,764
Fight with your kids.
Ever do that?

466
00:27:47,765 --> 00:27:49,132
Sure.

467
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:50,133
Sometimes.

468
00:27:50,134 --> 00:27:51,234
Why don't you ever

469
00:27:51,235 --> 00:27:53,436
put milk out for Santa anymore?

470
00:27:53,437 --> 00:27:54,805
Well, I don't have to.

471
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:57,107
All my kids are grown up
and gone away.

472
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:59,409
Ever go to that thing they have
on Christmas Eve?

473
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,878
Uh, do you always talk like this?

474
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:03,180
Like what?

475
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,648
Well, you bounce around
from one thing to the next.

476
00:28:05,649 --> 00:28:07,050
I can't keep up with you.

477
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:09,820
What thing on Christmas Eve?

478
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,121
Downtown.

479
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:14,891
Someone puts Prancer on
the display over main street.

480
00:28:14,892 --> 00:28:18,161
All those crowds, jolly people.

481
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:19,296
No, thank you.

482
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:27,503
And make sure you bring that
back when you're done.

483
00:28:27,504 --> 00:28:30,473
[cow moos]

484
00:28:30,474 --> 00:28:31,474
What do you want?

485
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,915
Hey.
Hey, there.

486
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:41,184
Charlie, right?

487
00:28:41,185 --> 00:28:44,955
<i>(Charlie)</i>
<i>Guess you're wondering why I</i>
<i>have a ten-gallon pail of milk.</i>

488
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:47,457
I figured you'd tell me
if you wanted me to know.

489
00:28:49,493 --> 00:28:52,462
Tom, you think Santa's
reindeer live forever?

490
00:28:52,463 --> 00:28:54,130
Never really thought about it.

491
00:28:54,131 --> 00:28:56,132
They've been around forever, right?

492
00:28:56,133 --> 00:28:57,667
Far as I know.

493
00:28:57,668 --> 00:28:59,269
And their names never change?

494
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,270
Right.

495
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:01,972
What if they don't live forever?

496
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:03,940
And they have babies,
and they grow up

497
00:29:03,941 --> 00:29:05,842
To take their parent's place?

498
00:29:05,843 --> 00:29:08,011
<i>Think that's possible?</i>

499
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:09,746
You seem to have given this

500
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:11,982
much more thought than I have,
Charlie,

501
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,483
so if you think it's possible,

502
00:29:13,484 --> 00:29:15,651
I think it's possible.

503
00:29:15,652 --> 00:29:17,487
Oh
oh, no, it's my mom.

504
00:29:18,422 --> 00:29:20,757
Um, that's your pail of milk

505
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:22,759
If she asks.

506
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,900
Looking for something?

507
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:33,803
What'd you do with him?

508
00:29:33,804 --> 00:29:35,038
Put him in the basement.

509
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,639
Where'd you get that thing?

510
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,241
You have to help me out.

511
00:29:38,242 --> 00:29:39,242
Mom's home.

512
00:29:39,243 --> 00:29:40,310
So?

513
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:41,511
She might like him.

514
00:29:41,512 --> 00:29:42,913
You know, he's kind of cute,

515
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,247
in an ugly sort of way.

516
00:29:44,248 --> 00:29:47,050
She won't even let us have a dog.

517
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,194
Tom Sullivan.

518
00:29:58,195 --> 00:29:59,529
Yeah?

519
00:30:05,536 --> 00:30:06,569

[giggles]

521
00:30:07,604 --> 00:30:09,906
(Charlie) Hi, Tom.
Hi, mom.

522
00:30:09,907 --> 00:30:11,841
What are you doing home?

523
00:30:11,842 --> 00:30:13,676
(Denise) I was getting groceries.

524
00:30:13,677 --> 00:30:15,245
Wait a minute.

525
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:16,646
How do you two know each other?

526
00:30:16,647 --> 00:30:20,850
We...yeah, we met at the parade
the other day.

527
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,154
Oh, mom, you need help
with the groceries?

528
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,889
Um...

529
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,391
Uh, I'll be right back.

530
00:30:34,131 --> 00:30:36,433
You know my mom?

531
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:37,733
Well, yeah, her

532
00:30:37,734 --> 00:30:39,936
Your uncle, her brother
and I were best friends

533
00:30:39,937 --> 00:30:40,971
In high school.

534
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:43,073
Help me get the milk
down to our basement.

535
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:44,240
Sure.

536
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:47,077
Wait a second.

537
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,544
Hey, Charlie, Charlie.

538
00:30:48,545 --> 00:30:49,812
What's going on here?

539
00:30:49,813 --> 00:30:50,813
Huh?

540
00:30:53,784 --> 00:30:56,586
I'd like to keep this
my secret for now.

541
00:30:56,587 --> 00:30:59,055
Okay, just be careful.

542
00:30:59,056 --> 00:31:01,524
If I were you, I wouldn't
keep anything in the house

543
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:03,159
If your mom
doesn't know about it.

544
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,427
(Denise) Charlie.

545
00:31:04,428 --> 00:31:05,795
I'll take it from here.

546
00:31:05,796 --> 00:31:07,730
You go talk to my mom.

547
00:31:07,731 --> 00:31:08,865
Charlie?

548
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:10,867
Hey.

549
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:11,968
I can't believe it.

550
00:31:11,969 --> 00:31:14,137
What are you doing back here

551
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:16,439
in the old house?

552
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,541
I thought you were gone for good.

553
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:19,942
Well, so did I.

554
00:31:19,943 --> 00:31:22,745
Oh, but you know, things happen.

555
00:31:22,746 --> 00:31:24,881
Well, how have you been, Tom?

556
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:27,683
Uh, can't complain.

557
00:31:27,684 --> 00:31:28,951
How's Marian?

558
00:31:28,952 --> 00:31:30,520
Good.

559
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:33,056
I don't know, I

560
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,291
I haven't talked to her
in a while.

561
00:31:35,292 --> 00:31:36,926
I'm sorry.

562
00:31:36,927 --> 00:31:38,395
I'm sorry to hear that.

563
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,797
Well, like you said, things happen.

564
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,071
The blue bomb.

565
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,305
Yeah.

566
00:31:49,306 --> 00:31:51,607
Dad left it to me.

567
00:31:51,608 --> 00:31:54,577
Man, your brother and I
tooled around in that thing.

568
00:31:54,578 --> 00:31:57,113
I know it's old and all, Denise,

569
00:31:57,114 --> 00:32:00,716
but it sounds terrible.

570
00:32:00,717 --> 00:32:01,651
Oh, I know.

571
00:32:01,652 --> 00:32:03,319
I've been meaning to take it in,

572
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,157
But time and money
I'm a little short on both.

573
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:10,593
I could take a look at it
for you sometime.

574
00:32:10,594 --> 00:32:14,030
What did you do,
become a mechanic?

575
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:15,331
No, no, no.

576
00:32:15,332 --> 00:32:18,535
I'm a, uh...

577
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:21,671
I'm like a handyman now.

578
00:32:21,672 --> 00:32:22,705
Do this and that.

579
00:32:22,706 --> 00:32:24,340
That's why I'm
in the neighborhood.

580
00:32:24,341 --> 00:32:28,111
I'm fixing the fence over there.

581
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,579
And I better get back to it.

582
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,416
So it was it was great seeing you.

583
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:36,386
Well, I'm glad you caught me
in front of the house,

584
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:39,289
Otherwise I don't think
you would have recognized me.

585
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,957
Well?

586
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:42,158
Well, it's okay.

587
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,627
I mean, I was
a lot younger back then.

588
00:32:44,628 --> 00:32:48,298
Life's tamed me a bit.

589
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,801
No, you look really good.

590
00:32:51,802 --> 00:32:53,703
Thank you.

591
00:32:53,704 --> 00:32:56,739
I'll see you around?

592
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,974
Yeah.

593
00:33:03,814 --> 00:33:07,717
I can't believe that Tom
was uncle Gary's best friend.

594
00:33:07,718 --> 00:33:12,955
Yeah, and he used to hang out
here all the time.

595
00:33:12,956 --> 00:33:16,058
[Prancer groaning]

596
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:17,693
Listen, guys,

597
00:33:17,694 --> 00:33:20,029
Um, I'm going to go out for a bit

598
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,297
After dinner

599
00:33:21,298 --> 00:33:23,766
For a cup of coffee
with an old friend.

600
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:25,001
[sighs]

601
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:26,002
Oh, good.

602
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:27,003
I mean,

603
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:29,105
<i>Have fun.</i>

604
00:33:29,106 --> 00:33:32,442
Be as late as you want.

605
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:37,913
Well, I thought it would be
kind of nice

606
00:33:37,914 --> 00:33:40,416
If the two of you could
do something together tonight.

607
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:43,153
[clears throat]

608
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:46,289
I think was mom's trying to say
is that,

609
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,525
Because I'm leaving
for Chicago tomorrow,

610
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,926
<i>It'd be cool if we hung out.</i>

611
00:33:50,927 --> 00:33:54,197
Um, I didn't want to tell you.

612
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,798
I thought you might get upset

613
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:58,301
Because I'm getting out
of the last day of school.

614
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:04,240
I don't care about that.

615
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:06,709
It's just going to be
a different kind of Christmas.

616
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:14,651
[doorbell rings]

617
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,232
Hi, Jim.

618
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,333
Good evening, Denise.

619
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:31,734
<i>(Denise) Come on in.</i>

620
00:34:31,735 --> 00:34:33,570
Charlie, you know Jim.

621
00:34:34,738 --> 00:34:36,806
That's Mr. Klock to you, young man.

622
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,944
Well, I rented a couple of videos,

623
00:34:41,945 --> 00:34:45,215
and there's some popcorn
in the cupboard.

624
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,583
Bye, Ryan.

625
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,484
See you later, Charlie.

626
00:34:48,485 --> 00:34:50,620
I hope not.

627
00:34:56,193 --> 00:34:57,293
Who is this guy?

628
00:34:57,294 --> 00:35:00,330
The Darth Vader
of elementary school.

629
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:07,637
You know you can't
keep him here.

630
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:09,706
Thought you said
mom might like him.

631
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:12,208
I was kidding.

632
00:35:12,209 --> 00:35:13,909
He's not going to be here for long.

633
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,113
I'll have him back with Santa
before you know it.

634
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:20,149
And how do you plan
on doing that?

635
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,418
I haven't thought about it.

636
00:35:22,419 --> 00:35:23,720
Well, maybe you should.

637
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,020
But in the meantime,

638
00:35:25,021 --> 00:35:27,790
You gotta find
another place for him.

639
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:30,560
Isn't he the greatest thing
you've ever seen?

640
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:31,728
Yeah.

641
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:34,530
He looks like he could be
on that cable show,

642
00:35:34,531 --> 00:35:36,399
Freaks of nature.

643
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,600
[grunts]

644
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:39,034
You didn't hear that.

645
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:44,807
Ryan,

646
00:35:44,808 --> 00:35:47,610
Thanks for helping out today.

647
00:35:47,611 --> 00:35:49,879
That was a cool thing to do.

648
00:35:53,116 --> 00:35:55,518
See, he's not so bad after all.

649
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:56,919
[groans]

650
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,422
(Klock) How about you, Denise?

651
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,291
What about me?

652
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,958
Well, you've come back
to three oaks.

653
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:05,060
Is that part of a master plan?

654
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:06,629
Oh.

655
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,698
No, I came back after dad died

656
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,934
In hopes to get the house
together and sell it.

657
00:36:11,935 --> 00:36:14,470
But it's been a bit of a struggle

658
00:36:14,471 --> 00:36:15,871
Making ends meet in Chicago

659
00:36:15,872 --> 00:36:17,373
Ever since Matt and I divorced.

660
00:36:17,374 --> 00:36:20,310
So I thought, "heck,

661
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,278
"here's a home ready to move into,

662
00:36:22,279 --> 00:36:23,946
with memories to boot."

663
00:36:23,947 --> 00:36:25,348
Good ones, I hope.

664
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,516
Sure.

665
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,651
And some not-so-good ones,

666
00:36:28,652 --> 00:36:30,687
but isn't that everybody's childhood?

667
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,689
If you're lucky,

668
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,692
The good memories
outweigh the bad.

669
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,460
And that's what I hope
for my boys,

670
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:40,095
that the good outweigh the bad.

671
00:36:40,096 --> 00:36:42,298
I mean, they're the main reason
I came here.

672
00:36:42,299 --> 00:36:46,268
I just want to make a real home
for them.

673
00:36:46,269 --> 00:36:47,903
(Charlie) I have an idea, Prancer.

Old acquaintance?

Yeah, he was my older brother's
best friend.

701
00:37:53,737 --> 00:37:55,571
Pretty crazy back then.

702
00:37:55,572 --> 00:37:57,040

Don't get me wrong.

I like Tom,

705
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:03,212
but he's the kind of guy who
never really grew up.

[whispering]
You know, I hate to say it, Denise,

713
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,797
but Tom totally irresponsible.

00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,568

No, no.

I don't think he wanted any.

another reason for the breakup.

Seems like fate.

926
00:52:28,878 --> 00:52:29,878
A pet deer?

927
00:52:29,879 --> 00:52:31,613
I mean, I can't believe it.

928
00:52:31,614 --> 00:52:32,814
Where did he find it?

929
00:52:32,815 --> 00:52:34,315
Where did he hide it?

930
00:52:34,316 --> 00:52:35,617
Mr. Klock?

931
00:52:35,618 --> 00:52:37,553
I'll be accompanying
the search party.

932
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:38,987
Excuse me.

933
00:52:38,988 --> 00:52:40,022
Very good.

934
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:41,990
When you find that deer,

935
00:52:41,991 --> 00:52:43,491
I want it put down.

936
00:52:43,492 --> 00:52:44,560
You understand?

937
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:46,494
See, Denise.

938
00:52:46,495 --> 00:52:47,963
Here's the sheriff.

939
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:49,932
Everything's under control.

940
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:51,967
My son's run off
with a dangerous deer.

941
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:53,535
How is that under control?

942
00:52:53,536 --> 00:52:55,170
Did you say something
to him, Jim?

943
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,337
No.

944
00:52:56,338 --> 00:52:58,774
I mean, I think I was
very understanding.

945
00:52:58,775 --> 00:52:59,808
Excuse me.

946
00:53:02,111 --> 00:53:04,947
(Charlie) He'll be coming after us,
Prancer.

947
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:08,283
We'll have to stay hidden
until Christmas Eve.

948
00:53:08,284 --> 00:53:11,552
That's two whole days
and two nights.

949
00:53:11,553 --> 00:53:14,356
I've never even camped out before.

950
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,891
First things first.

951
00:53:16,892 --> 00:53:18,526
Shelter:

952
00:53:18,527 --> 00:53:23,398
Gotta find some.

953
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:27,035
Wonder if that's the way
to antler Ridge.

954
00:53:27,036 --> 00:53:30,938
Come on. Let's go.

955
00:53:30,939 --> 00:53:32,940
Hey, slow down, will ya?

956
00:53:35,244 --> 00:53:37,979
(man) This is a little different
than your typical search.

957
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,647
The boy may not want
to be found.

958
00:53:39,648 --> 00:53:42,117
We've got to get to him
before sundown.

959
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:44,919
After dark, he may not be able
to get home,

960
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,389
Even if he wants to.

961
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,057
Each group have a walkie-talkie?

962
00:53:49,058 --> 00:53:50,425
Yeah, sir.

963
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:53,495
Why don't you head on home,
Denise?

964
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:55,963
I'll be in constant touch
with the search parties,

965
00:53:55,964 --> 00:53:58,166
And I'll call you
the second I hear anything.

966
00:53:58,167 --> 00:54:00,101
I'm going to go get
some warmer clothes.

967
00:54:00,102 --> 00:54:01,536
I can't just stay at home

968
00:54:01,537 --> 00:54:04,239
While my son is out
in the Forest somewhere.

969
00:54:10,546 --> 00:54:13,048
We'll go the rest of the way
tomorrow.

970
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:16,017
This is a pretty good place
to stay for the night.

971
00:54:16,018 --> 00:54:17,385
[grunts]

972
00:54:17,386 --> 00:54:20,555
[sighs] of course, I'm not sure
what we're going to do

973
00:54:20,556 --> 00:54:23,258
For the next three to four hours.

974
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:25,160
Hey, I have an idea.

975
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:27,128
Why don't I tell you a story?

976
00:54:27,129 --> 00:54:30,565
I bet you like stories.

977
00:54:30,566 --> 00:54:32,667
A Christmas Carol.

978
00:54:32,668 --> 00:54:35,236
There once was a Guy
named scrooge,

979
00:54:35,237 --> 00:54:37,372
The meanest man around

980
00:54:37,373 --> 00:54:40,708
Like Klock, that guy you bit.

981
00:54:40,709 --> 00:54:43,778
Picture him.

982
00:54:43,779 --> 00:54:48,283
Well, scrooge lives all alone
in a house that nobody enters,

983
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,051
And he's mean to everybody.

984
00:54:50,052 --> 00:54:52,720
He gives no money to the poor.

985
00:54:52,721 --> 00:54:55,156
[echoing] He hates it when dogs

986
00:54:55,157 --> 00:54:58,093
To his family and scrooge

987
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:02,063
And says "God bless us, every one."

988
00:55:02,064 --> 00:55:04,265
Isn't that a great story?

989
00:55:04,266 --> 00:55:08,169
Of course, it's better told
around a nice, warm fireplace.

990
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:10,338
[grunting]

991
00:55:14,676 --> 00:55:16,611
Hey, you're warm.

992
00:55:16,612 --> 00:55:19,847
There, that's better.

993
00:55:22,151 --> 00:55:24,119
[phone ringing]

994
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,120
Hello.

995
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:26,954
Denise, it's Jim.

996
00:55:26,955 --> 00:55:28,889
<i>Listen, you probably</i>
<i>know this already,</i>

997
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:31,892
But all the parties have called
<i>off the search for the night.</i>

998
00:55:31,893 --> 00:55:34,895
Uh, yeah, I know that, Jim.

999
00:55:34,896 --> 00:55:36,164
Are you okay?

1000
00:55:36,165 --> 00:55:38,399
Maybe I should come over
and spend the night.

1001
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,567
<i>(Denise) Uh, no.</i>

1002
00:55:39,568 --> 00:55:41,469
I'm, be fine.

1003
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:44,005
I'm a little worried about you.

1004
00:55:44,006 --> 00:55:47,008
Well, you know,
I'm worried about Charlie,

1005
00:55:47,009 --> 00:55:48,676
But thank you for your concern,

1006
00:55:48,677 --> 00:55:50,678
And I'll call you if I need anything.

1007
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:52,713
Bye.

1008
00:55:59,788 --> 00:56:00,788
[doorbell rings]

1009
00:56:03,925 --> 00:56:05,326
Tom, hi.

1010
00:56:05,327 --> 00:56:07,061
I'm sorry for bothering you.

1011
00:56:07,062 --> 00:56:08,530
No, no, no.

1012
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:09,531
I just got home.

1013
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:10,798
I was working all day.

1014
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:13,268
I didn't know about Charlie
till I got your message.

1015
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:14,536
Um...

1016
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:15,637
<i>Tom, did you know about</i>

1017
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:16,904
Charlie and his deer?

1018
00:56:16,905 --> 00:56:17,938
No.

1019
00:56:20,008 --> 00:56:21,176
I knew something was up,

1020
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:23,511
But he said he wanted
to keep it a secret,

1021
00:56:23,512 --> 00:56:25,980
And I told him he shouldn't
have anything in the house

1022
00:56:25,981 --> 00:56:27,348
That you didn't know about.

1023
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:29,050
I should have mentioned something.

1024
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:35,690
I told Charlie
I'd keep his secret a secret,

1025
00:56:35,691 --> 00:56:39,627
And my word's good.

1026
00:56:39,628 --> 00:56:42,229
But kids don't always know
what's best for them.

1027
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:44,165
Well, sometimes they do, Denise.

1028
00:56:44,166 --> 00:56:45,600
You just have to trust them.

1029
00:56:45,601 --> 00:56:48,770
[sighing]

1030
00:56:48,771 --> 00:56:51,973
I don't even know
if I can trust myself anymore.

1031
00:56:51,974 --> 00:56:53,775
<i>Sometimes I think</i>
<i>Ryan and Charlie</i>

1032
00:56:53,776 --> 00:56:56,578
Would be so much better
with their father.

1033
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:59,080
Not that matt is the best dad
in the world,

1034
00:56:59,081 --> 00:57:00,181
But he's so practical.

1035
00:57:00,182 --> 00:57:01,315
I mean, he wouldn't let

1036
00:57:01,316 --> 00:57:02,617
<i>Any of this get by him.</i>

1037
00:57:02,618 --> 00:57:05,653
Well, you can't blame yourself
for Charlie running off.

1038
00:57:05,654 --> 00:57:07,689
<i>Why can't I?</i>

1039
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,423
I mean, Ryan's taken off to Chicago.

1040
00:57:09,424 --> 00:57:12,794
Charlie... I don't even know
where Charlie is.

1041
00:57:12,795 --> 00:57:15,262
This isn't a home.

1042
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:18,633
This is a place to run away from.

1043
00:57:18,634 --> 00:57:20,602
Oh, God.

1044
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:21,769
Poor Charlie.

1045
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:25,272
Okay, look,
Charlie's gonna be all right.

1046
00:57:25,273 --> 00:57:26,674
He's tougher than you think.

1047
00:57:26,675 --> 00:57:28,977
And you need to get

1048
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:30,044
Some sleep,

1049
00:57:30,045 --> 00:57:34,315
And I'll come back
as soon as it's light,

1050
00:57:34,316 --> 00:57:37,184
And we'll go find him.

1051
00:57:37,185 --> 00:57:38,720
Have a little Faith, Denise.

1052
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:41,455
We're gonna find him, okay?

1053
00:57:44,593 --> 00:57:47,261

You know, I feel bad.

1071
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:55,897
You know why?

1072

for another two days.

or starve.

1077
00:59:07,943 --> 00:59:10,178
I can't take care of you anymore.

1078
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:12,747
[grunting]

1079
00:59:12,748 --> 00:59:15,282
You have to fly away.

1080
00:59:15,283 --> 00:59:17,618
It's the only thing to do.

1081
00:59:17,619 --> 00:59:20,454
Head for the north pole.

1082
00:59:20,455 --> 00:59:23,124
It's time, Prancer,

1083
00:59:23,125 --> 00:59:26,427
Time for you
to take your father's place.

1084
00:59:26,428 --> 00:59:28,763
<i>Here's what you do.</i>

1085
00:59:28,764 --> 00:59:31,265
<i>You run as fast as you can,</i>

1086
00:59:31,266 --> 00:59:34,235
think positive thoughts,
flying kind of thoughts,

1087
00:59:34,236 --> 00:59:36,170
and you jump up,

1088
00:59:36,171 --> 00:59:38,539
and you should be able
to take off into the Sky.

1089
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,808
Let's try one, okay?

1090
00:59:43,979 --> 00:59:44,979
That's it.

1091
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:45,980
Faster, boy.

1092
00:59:45,981 --> 00:59:47,615
Remember, think flying thoughts.

1093
00:59:47,616 --> 00:59:49,617
On three, jump into the air.

1094
00:59:49,618 --> 00:59:50,785
You ready?

1095
00:59:50,786 --> 00:59:52,720
One, two,

1096
00:59:52,721 --> 00:59:53,921
three.

1097
00:59:53,922 --> 00:59:55,322
Oof!

1098
00:59:55,323 --> 00:59:58,192
[grunts]

1099
00:59:59,728 --> 01:00:03,397
No, Prancer,
you're supposed to take off.

1100
01:00:03,398 --> 01:00:05,432
Like an airplane.

1101
01:00:05,433 --> 01:00:08,136
Let's try it again.

1102
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:15,009
Isn't this the way to antler Ridge?

1103
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:18,279

01:08:53,628 --> 01:08:55,429
Honey.

1281
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:57,798
(Tom) Okay, thank you.

1282
01:08:57,799 --> 01:09:00,301
That was Mr. Dexter,
the supervisor at the shelter.

1283
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:01,669
The mayor called him

1284
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:04,371
And told him not to touch
that deer tomorrow morning.

1285
01:09:04,372 --> 01:09:06,940
There's going to be a big
meeting at the town hall

1286
01:09:06,941 --> 01:09:07,974
Tomorrow at 5:00.

1287
01:09:07,975 --> 01:09:09,610
They're going to discuss this thing.

1288
01:09:09,611 --> 01:09:11,445
You want up?

1289
01:09:11,446 --> 01:09:13,146
There you go.

Hop on, I'll give you

1295
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:24,358
Oof!

1296
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:25,359
Oh!

1297
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,993
What have you been eating?

1298
01:09:26,994 --> 01:09:28,962
I don't know.

1299
01:09:28,963 --> 01:09:30,497

1300
01:09:30,498 --> 01:09:31,799

Quite a day, huh?

1303
01:09:40,141 --> 01:09:42,075
I was outside Charlie's room
this afternoon

1304
01:09:42,076 --> 01:09:45,078
when you were talking to him.

1305
01:09:45,079 --> 01:09:47,614
I saw him hug you.

1306
01:09:47,615 --> 01:09:48,682
Hmm.

1307
01:09:48,683 --> 01:09:50,083
And just right now,

1308
01:09:50,084 --> 01:09:54,921
when you took him
upstairs to bed...

1309
01:09:54,922 --> 01:09:57,591
I know it is such a simple thing,

1310
01:09:57,592 --> 01:10:01,528
but you have no idea
how good it is to see that.

1311
01:10:01,529 --> 01:10:04,030
Oh, hey, he's a great kid.

1312
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:07,768
And you got a lot to do with that.

1313

1314
01:10:10,338 --> 01:10:11,905
Thanks.

1315
01:10:16,578 --> 01:10:18,912
You know, Tom,
for never wanting to have kids,

1316
01:10:18,913 --> 01:10:21,948
you have quite
an easy way with them.

1317
01:10:21,949 --> 01:10:24,951
Who told you
I didn't want to have kids?

1318
01:10:24,952 --> 01:10:30,123
Marian was the one who wanted
to hold off having a family.

1319
01:10:30,124 --> 01:10:34,795
Wanted to see the world first
and, uh...

1320

1321
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:41,835
I don't think she thought
I would be a good father.

1322
01:10:41,836 --> 01:10:44,304
I'm kind of unpredictable at times.

1323
01:10:44,305 --> 01:10:47,541
Like a big kid.

1324
01:10:47,542 --> 01:10:51,678
Maybe that's why I get along
with them so well.

1325
01:10:53,648 --> 01:10:55,716
It's a shame
we were such a mismatch.

1326
01:10:55,717 --> 01:10:57,951
I mean, I would have loved

1327
01:10:57,952 --> 01:11:00,987
To have a big ol' house
full of kids,

1328
01:11:00,988 --> 01:11:02,155
You know?

1329
01:11:02,156 --> 01:11:04,324
But you meet someone,

1330
01:11:04,325 --> 01:11:09,696
And you think you're
the love of their life.

1331
01:11:09,697 --> 01:11:11,532
You find out you're not.

1332
01:11:13,701 --> 01:11:15,869
I know the feeling.

1333
01:11:22,977 --> 01:11:24,778

antler Ridge by 7:00 tomorrow.

I will, one way or another.

last night:

I want to remind everybody
about the buck

1376

That came into town
a few years back.
