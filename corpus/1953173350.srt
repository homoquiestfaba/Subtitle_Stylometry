525
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,910
I was thoroughly expired.

526
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,250
I stunk so bad, I walked into the airport in Beijing,

527
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,340
Chinese people there were going,

528
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,780
"Oh, God, you stink."

529
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,350
"You're from India."

530
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,120
"Well, go to hell!"

531
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,520
"I'm from Canada."

532
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,290
"That's how Canadians smell."

533
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,980
So now, I have a show that night and I have no clothes,

534
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,400
and I'm wearing sweatpants, sweatshirt,

535
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,840
baseball hat, running shoes, you know what I mean?

536
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,600
I'm... I'm dressed for comfort.

537
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,710
I can't go on stage like that,

538
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,400
so I have to go to this mall in Beijing

539
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,610
to go buy some clothes.

540
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,610
Now, I didn't know this until I got there,

541
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,170
but apparently in China,

542
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,080
I'm Shaquile O'Neal.

543
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,170
I go to the mall, I walk into the store, I'm like,

544
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,390
"Hey, do you have 10.5 or 11 on that shoes?"

545
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,320
"Uh, no."

546
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,110
"How about an eight?"

547
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,260
"How about I can't negotiate my foot size with you?"

548
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,060
How about that?

549
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,250
"Alright, how about a 36 on those pants?"

550
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,390
"36 is too big!"

551
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,930
"You're too fat!"

552
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,650
"Lose some weight, fat boy!"

553
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,040
"Come back when you're 30, 32 the most."

554
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,740
I'm like, "How can I not find clothes in China?"

555
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,470
"Isn't everything made there?"

556
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,200
All in all, a good trip, though.

557
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,560
I did so much traveling, my passport expired last summer,

558
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,150
I had to renew my passport.

559
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,190
I don't know about it in America, but in Canada,

560
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,780
when you do passport photos,

561
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,320
you're not allowed to smile.

562
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,630
That's the new rule. You're not allowed to smile.

563
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,920
This is their way of fighting terrorism.

564
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,480
This is how they're gonna catch the terrorists.

565
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,690
You can't smile.

566
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,750
That's the message we're sending you. If you can,

567
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,190
If you're traveling, you'd better not be happy.

568
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,200
I didn't know, right? I'm in the mall,

569
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,860
I walked into one of those places that says "We do passport photos,"

570
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,710
I walked in, I'm like, "Yo, I need some passport photos."

571
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,140
The guy goes "No problem, buddy. Sit down."

572
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,010
Which really pissed me off,

573
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:22,820
cause he's a white guy,

574
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,690
and I don't know why he's talking like that, right? So...

575
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,120
I think he was mocking me.

576
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,510
So I sit down.
The guy goes "You ready?"

577
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,210
I go, "Yeah."

578
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,290
It's a picture, and I'm a happy guy,

579
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,490
so I figured, alright.

580
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,490
He goes, "You ready?" And I smiled, I'm like this.

581
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,060
The guy goes, "Sir, sir."

582
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,610
"Your lips need to be touching."

583
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,070
"Alright."

584
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,980
"Sir. Sir, you can't smile."

585
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,620
Not like that, I can't smile. Of course I'm...

586
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,400
That's their way.

587
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,320
This is how they really think they're going to find the terrorist.

588
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,360
It's by making you not smile.

589
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,710
You wanna find the terrorist?

590
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:09,960
Make everybody smile.

591
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,860
And the people who don't want to smile?

592
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,160
Question them!

593
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,690
Whenever you've been watching CNN,

594
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,720
and they show you the terrorists that they're looking for,

595
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,730
and those guys are happy?

596
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,530
Never!

597
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,010
Sir, you never see like a shot of a terrorist stand around, going,

598
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,740
You know, there's never the one joker terrorist guy

599
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,800
with his thumb on the detonator,

600
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,100
"I'll do it! I'll do it!"

601
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,730
"I'll... Ah, you flinched, you bastard! I saw you flinched!"

602
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,900
So I wasn't allowed to smile.

603
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,500
So now, if it wasn't bad enough

604
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,460
being a brown man, going to the airport,

605
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,940
now when I give them my passport, I look pissed off.

606
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,920
My picture in my passport looks like this.

607
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:55,850
They're taking my passport,

608
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,170
"Now, Mr. Peters, step this way, please."

609
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,700
"We'd like a few words with you."

610
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,800
It's hard, man. The security at the airport,

611
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,040
the Custom, Immigration,

612
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,930
they really need to learn the difference between a terrorist

613
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:08,880
and an Indian.

614
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,210
We're not the same!

615
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,260
We're not!

616
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,360
We're not from the same part of the world,

617
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,280
we don't speak the same language, we don't eat the same food.

618
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,630
We don't even hate the same people.

619
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,270
Terrorists hate Americans.

620
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,400
Indians hate each other.

621
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,500
A terrorist will blow up an airport.

622
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,310
Indians like to work at the airport.

623
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,160
"That will be counter-productive."

624
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,050
I know a lot of white people are nervous about flying nowadays,

625
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,620
I understand to a certain degree,

626
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,290
but I had one white guy like, "No, man. I don't fly anymore."

627
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,870
"You never know what shit's gonna go down up there."

628
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,270
I'm like, "What? Nothing's going down up there, dude."

629
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,910
"Yeah, well, you never know."

630
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:06,770
And I understand, you know what I mean? You're a little panicked a little bit,

631
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:08,450
but think about it reasonably, you know what I mean?

632
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,630
Think about it logically.

633
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,350
Think about what airline you're getting on.

634
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,170
Where you're getting on the plane, where you're flying to, you know what I mean?

635
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,680
That all factors in your whole terrorist theory.

636
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,940
I was on a JetBlue flight.

637
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,030
See? JetBlue is funny enough.

638
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,180
I was on a JetBlue flight from Buffalo, New York to La Guardia.

639
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,120
It was like a 30-seat plane.

640
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:29,920
[WITH INDIAN ACCENT]
Plane.

641
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,420
Oh my God, my Indian torrent is acting up.

642
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,090
"30-seat plane."

643
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,570
We all go through it.

644
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,450
So I get on board this little plane.

645
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,130
It's a 45 minute flight.

646
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,280
I walked on board,

647
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,520
this older white lady sees me, grabs her bag, goes

648
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,930
"Oh, my God!"

649
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,760
I'm like, "What?"

650
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,140
"You think I'm a terrorist?"

651
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,610
"On freaking JetBlue?"

652
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,460
"What am I? The low self-esteem terrorist?"

653
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,820
"Yeah, I don't want to kill a lot of us today,"

654
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,190
"tought I start off with 30."

655
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,430
"Tomorrow, Southwest."

656
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,170
Just think about it logically, you know.

657
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,850
I was on a flight like two weeks after 9-11,

658
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,590
I sat down beside this white guy, he almost shit his pants.

659
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,750
I sat down, the guy goes like this.

660
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,940
[BREATHING NERVOUSLY]

661
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,450
About half an hour into the flight, I reached for my bag,

662
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:46,340
the guy goes, "Oh my God! No!"

663
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,320
"What? Relax, you jackass."

664
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,470
"Just getting my Discman."

665
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,250
"Gotta listen to my instructions."

666
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,180
Glad Latinos are here, man.

667
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,670
All six of you.

668
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,110
You full Latino? You half?

669
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:16,030
What are you?

670
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,480
He does this. Half.

671
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,280
That's half?

672
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,150
That's how you cut him.

673
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,590
What are you? What's your mix?

674
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,050
Uh, Puerto Rican and black.

675
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,480
Puerto Rican and black.

676
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,950
That's not far off. They're from New York, your parents?

677
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:30,610
One is.

678
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:32,460
One is? Which one?

679
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,790
Puerto Rican?

680
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,630
Is he really?

681
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,200
Nice. a Puerto Rican and black. That's cool, man.

682
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,690
We don't-- we don't have any Puerto Ricans in Canada.

683
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,750
We don't have any Mexican. Any Mexican people here?

684
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,220
You? One guy's like...

685
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,350
Are you full Mexican?

686
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:49,700
Yup.

687
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,130
Nice. What's your name?

688
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:51,550
Jose.

689
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,240
Jose? Wow, just...

690
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,200
just in case we didn't believe him, you know?

691
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,000
I like the Mexicans.

692
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,780
Well, there's no Mexicans in Canada either, man.

693
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,930
There's none. There's no Mexicans in Canada.

694
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,460
You should see how messed up our lawns are.

695
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:15,840
Now, uh...

696
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,360
What? All of a sudden everybody got sensitive.

697
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,090
"Oh, hey! That's not..."

698
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,740
"Everybody else, it's fine."

699
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,820
"But you don't say shit about the lawn."

700
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,780
It's funny how defensive they got for you.

701
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,520
You see that, Jose? They got your back.

702
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,980
No Mexican. I wish we had Mexicans,

703
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,810
but we got a lot of-- we got-- we got Latinos,

704
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,940
but we got a lot of South Americans, you know what I mean? All the,

705
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,850
like, Chileans and all the,

706
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:49,530
all the, uh, Uruguay and all the soccer countries. You know what I mean?

707
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,410
We got all them.

708
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,630
But, see, I live in LA now.

709
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,430
And in LA there are a lot of Mexicans,

710
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,570
and one of my good friends, Jesus,

711
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:58,510
"<i>Hay-soos</i>."

712
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,670
It's just cool to hang around a guy named Jesus, you know what I mean? That's...

713
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,760
"Who's your friend?"
"The son of God."

714
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,600
That's uh...

715
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,660
I like hanging around Jesus, man.

716
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:13,090
'Cause Mexican, Latinos in general are very proud people,

717
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:13,740
you know what I mean?

718
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,270
You don't ever mess up anything Spanish around them.

719
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,890
They get very upset, like you're supposed to know how to say their shit.

720
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,370
I'm like, "Jesus, I'm gonna go get a burrito, man."

721
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,090
"Hey!"

722
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,290
"It's <i>Buh-ree-toh</i>."

723
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:32,020
"Holy shit. I'm <i>sorryto</i>, OK?"

724
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,180
The Latinos in Canada is trying to play that, see?

725
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,170
The guys in the, the Mexican cats in LA, they all play that--"

726
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,440
a lot of them play that hardcore cholo thing, you know?

727
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,680
That whole gangster thing.

728
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,900
"Hey, ese, I want to talk to you for a minute. Eh, fucker?"

729
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:54,770
They play it hard, you know? They--

730
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,040
They got that intensity about them.

731
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,120
Even Jesus will approach me,

732
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,570
"Hey, Russell, let me talk to you for a second, eh?"

733
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,170
"What? What did I do?"

734
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,970
"Nothing. I'm just saying hi."

735
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:08,100
"Damn, Jesus. You wanna relax a little?"

736
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:12,160
The Latinos in Canada, all the South American guys,

737
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,950
they play that whole smooth Latin lover shit all the time, you know?

738
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,260
Too much, to the point, like,

739
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,510
where they're trying to seduce everybody all the time.

740
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,240
You know what I mean?

741
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,920
I went to this Spanish club in Toronto.

742
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,240
This girl goes, "Oh, Russell, I want you to meet Fernando."

743
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,130
This guy turns around, and goes, "Hola."

744
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,040
[WITH SMOOTH SPANISH ACCENT]
"I am Fernando."

745
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,460
I'm like, "You want to put your cock away, Fernando?"

746
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,020
"I'm just trying to shake your hand. It's uh..."

747
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,200
"...not that kind of party."

748
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,580
But I like, I like the Latinos.

749
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,370
'Cause you know why?

750
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,600
They could have the most normal accent in the world,

751
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,580
but the minute they start saying like a South American country,

752
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,760
it sounds like they just stepped off a boat a second ago.

753
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,490
You know what I mean?

754
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:54,360
"Hey, where you from?"

755
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,510
"Well, I'm from here, but my family's originally from Ecuador."

756
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,680
"What the hell happened to you just now?"

757
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,650
And the more Spanish countries they say,

758
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,290
the more it sounds like they're going deaf, you know?

759
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,230
"Well, I'm from Ecuador. This is my friend from Nicaragua."

760
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,730
"Eastern Guatemala."

"Peru! Peru!"

766
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,240
I like cultural names.

767
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,460
Cultural names are really cool, you know.

768
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,880
I don't have a cultural name.

769
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,220
And Indian people for some reason have a real tough time with this.

770
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,210
But my real name is Russell Peters.

771
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,690
Both my parents are from India,

772
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,320
and that's the name they gave me.

773
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,480
Russell Dominic...

774
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,700
Look at you dumb motherfuckers right there!

775
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,870
Do you know Indian history at all?

776
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:51,720
At all?

777
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,470
No, you don't. You know why? I can tell you there's no Indian history.

778
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,270
The British were there for 400 years.

779
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,940
You don't think they fucked one or two of us?

780
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,770
If they can steal all our jewelries,

781
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,540
they can bang one or two of us.

782
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:13,250
That's my real name. Both my parents are from India,

783
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:15,460
and they named me Russell Dominic Peters.

784
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,740
Dominic. I got an Italian middle name.

785
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,170

If I had an Indian name, I'd wear it proudly.

So sure that this wasn't my name, but has no clue what your name...

I think the Indian names are very cool.

821
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:00,920
They have deep meanings to them. They have long history behind them.

I think a lot of Indian names are really cool, but...

851
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:20,320
I think a lot of-- cultural names are cool.

852
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,640
But if you're gonna be, if you're gonna have a cultural name,

853

and you're gonna move from another country to America,

854

When they come here with those names,

861
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,400
it just doesn't cross over very well.

862

"...don't really like it, though. I..."

875
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,630
And obviously it's not pronounced 'suck deep' in my culture,

876
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,420
you know what I mean?

877
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,070
But if you were to read it, that's how you read it.

878
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,390
It's spelled S-U-K-H-D-E-E-P.

879
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,320
The 'H' doesn't help.

880
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,100
'Cause now it sounds even worse.

881
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,950
Suck huh Deep.

882
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,120
"Come here, Suck-huh-Deep!"

883
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:50,390
And I used to think Sukhdeep was the funniest Indian name I've ever heard.

884
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,200
And then a few months ago, I was in D.C.,

885
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,570
and I met this Indian dude. And I shit you not,

886
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:55,930
the guy's real name

887
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,140
was Hardik.

888
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,860
H-A-R-D-I-K.

889
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,190
Hardik!

890
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:04,870
Who the hell name their kid <i>Hard Dick</i>?

891
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,810
"Hey, come on, Hardik, pull up your pants."

892
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,380
"Stop that. It's not nice."

893
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:18,880
Hard dick.

894
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,250
How can you not get into a career in porn with a name like Hard Dick?

895
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,680
What if Hardik and Sukhdeep became best friends?

896
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,640
You're a Punjabi, you know what I'm saying.

897
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,230
You guys cross the line with us as well.

898
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:36,130
I met an Indian girl named Ramindeep.

899
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,030
Ram-in-deep!

900
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,730
"Hey, get in there, Ramindeep."

901
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,530
Sure, it's not pronounced like that,

902
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,580
but it sounds funnier when you say Ram-in-deep.

903
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:53,900
Just think, you know.

904
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,600
And I don't know why the Indian guys just can't wrap--

905
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,450
Indian people can't wrap their head around my name.

906
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:58,960
I don't know why it's that difficult.

907
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,190
It's very simple. Just go read a history book

908
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,560
and it'll all make sense to you.

909
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:04,600
And Indian people are always the worst about it. The worst.

910
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,630
White people here. "Russell Peters."
"Oh, okay."

911
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:09,010
They don't have a problem with it. They don't get it.

912
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:10,530
They just, "Oh, I don't care. Yeah."

913
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:12,910
"Maybe he's just a dark white guy. I don't know what he is. It's uh..."

914
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,010
"Maybe somewhere south. I don't know what he is."

915
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,540

916
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:24,840
"Yes, I am."

917
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:25,580
South?

918
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,690
No, not from the south. See, I'm not one of them.

919
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:29,600
I know what you're thinking. I'm not one of them.

920
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,890
Those were converts.

921
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,360
I was mixed.

922
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,360
We don't know when the mix happened.

923
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,130
It just happened.

924
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:38,340
We're a long line of us.

925
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:40,860
Indian people are the worst. 'Cause uh...

926
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,600
You tell my name to a white guy: "Russell Peters."

927
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,820
"How're you doing? Nice to meet you."

928
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,510
Indian people, they'll first want to question you.

929
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:47,800
And the Indian people, when they try to get information out of you,

930
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,920
they're the worst at it.

931
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:50,950
They're not very convincing.

932
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:52,740
You can always tell when an Indian person's

933
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,820
trying to convince you to tell them something.

934
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,550
'Cause when they're trying to convince you,

935
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,790
they give you this look like they're taking a shit.

936
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,050
They do. They'll come like this.

937
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,290
"Hey, Russell."

938
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,320

They're not very convincing people, you know?

942
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,040
Parents are the worst 'cause they--

943
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,830
White parents are very direct, you know what I mean?

944
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:28,980
You have white parents. Where are you?

945
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,240
There you are, white guy. Yeah.

947
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:32,460
Steve.

Steve, Jose, and Anit Patel.

951
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:49,480
White parents are very direct.

952
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,440
They want their kids to something?

953
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,420
"Hey, Steve, come here and clean up your room."

954
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:53,960
They tell you right away.

955
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:57,020
Indian parents feel the need to convince their kids to do things.

956
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,640
And if they don't make the shit face,

957
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,090
they'll take one word and try and make it sound convincing.

958

That's their convincing sound.

00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,970
Yeah, they do. They do things.

976

That's when they embarrass you.

You can try and be as hardcore as you want,

Indian parents will do that too.

989
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:35,180
I remember when I was like 14, I used to break-dance.

991
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:37,220

That was me back in the day, man.

994
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:52,960
But I remember, like, when I was 14, I'd be out there all day.

995
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,220
"Come on, we're gonna break. Come on, everybody. We're gonna break."

"We're gonna break all day, man!"

00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,590
And then when my family would come over,

998
00:46:58,590 --> 00:46:59,880
I didn't want to like, break in front of them.

999
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,520

00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,260
"I'm speaking English, dude. I don't know what the hell you're speaking right now."

1049
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:27,870
"You're speaking constipatese or something."

1050
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:28,960
"I don't know what that is,"

1051
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,730
"but you need fiber, jeeves."

1052
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,020
"England. Ha!"

1053
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,090
It just-- It looks ugly sometimes, you know?

1054
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:39,590
I think that's why English guys don't get laid a lot, man.

1055
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,480
Women don't want that pounding them, do they?

1056
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,190
"Oh, God, ooh, ahh!"

1057
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:44,370
"Aah!"

1058
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,270
"What a delightful feeling! Oh my God! Ah!"

1059
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,960
"That is smashing! Oh! Aah!"

1060
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,250
"Ooh, aha! Oh!"

1061
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:55,760
"Oh my God, I'm arriving! Ah!"

1062
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,530
How long have you been in America for?

1063
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,150
Twelve, thirteen years?

1064
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,730
And you guys met in England, obviously, because he's a brown man.

1065
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:23,600
'Cause I don't know if you're aware of this now,

1066
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,230
but England has the largest population of Indian people outside of India.

1067
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,690
It's true. They're all there.

1068
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:30,990
And the British are so pissed off that we're there.

1069
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,020
They're mad 'cause there's so many of us, and...

1070
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:34,620
as a brown man, when I walk around England,

1071
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:36,350
I can feel it, hear them under their breath.

1072
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:39,110
"Go home, you brown bastards!"

1073
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,070
"Ha!"

1074
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:48,560
And they're mad. They're mad because there's so many Indian people in England.

1075
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,390
And that's not our fault. That's the British people's fault.

1076
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:51,460
You guys started it.

1077
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:54,920
You went to India first. We didn't ask you to come over.

1078
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:59,300
1600. They just showed up.

1079
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:03,190
They stayed for 400 years.

1080
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:05,590
1947, they just got up and left.

1081
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:06,720
We were like, "No, no, no. Wait."

1082
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,000
"We're coming with you."

1083
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,790
"You can't just come here and leave."

1084
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:19,850
"What the hell are you going to eat?"

1085
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:22,720
"Coming."

1086
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,030
"Coming?"

1087
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:25,780
"Coome."

1088
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,050
My white American friends, I uh...

1089
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:40,630
Steve, your families from America?

1090
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:43,120
Nice. And you're married to a brown girl, right?

1091
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,320
Nice. How long have you guys been married for?

1092
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:46,290
Eleven years.

1093
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,450
Eleven years? Nice.

1094
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:49,870
You know what's funny?

1095
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:51,290
Nowadays, eleven years is "Wow!"

1096
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:52,790
Back then, "Eleven? That's it?"

1097
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:55,230
Now it's like, "Wow, you made it."

1098
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,740
We have three kids.

1099
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,140
Three kids? Nice, little beige babies. Nice.

1100
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:03,110
Nice, good job, huh?

1101
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:05,220
Indian women are good. They're sexy, right?

1102
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:07,230
Spicy. Spicy, though, huh?

1103
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:08,910
If you're going down on her,

1104
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:10,790
better take a glass of water, that's all I'm saying. You know what I mean?

1105
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:12,610
That's all I'm saying.

1106
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:16,330
"Uh, huh! Huh!"

1107
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:21,710
[MAKING SOUND OF BURNT TONGUE]

1108
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:39,180
White people, my white American friends,

1109
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,890
I'm here to tell you something, alright?

1110
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:42,110
I like you.

1111
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,220
And I'm not just saying that to say it.

1112
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:46,770
I'm telling you for a reason.

1113
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:51,270
Because I think white folks have really done some major things in the past 30 years.

1114
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:53,550
They've really taken some strides.

1115
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:55,870
And I feel bad for them too because white people--

1116
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:59,960
we, all the non-white people in the world have white folks convinced

1117
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,390
that they're racist.

1118
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:05,450
We have them so scared to notice anything of color,

1119
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,870
that they're afraid to describe things accurately now.

1120
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:10,680
I was working at this comedy club.

1121
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,670
One of my black friends came down to hang out with me,

1122
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:13,680
and the doorman comes up and goes,

1123
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,330
"Hey, Russell. One of your friends came by."

1124
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:17,820
"He was a black guy?"
"I don't know."

1125
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,570
"I didn't notice."

1126
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:26,840
"What do you mean, you didn't notice?"

1127
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,760
"What he look like?"
"He was tall."

1128
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:32,210
"Curly hair."

1129
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:36,020
"What was his name?"
"Uh, LeRoy."

1130
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:39,810
"Was he black?"
"I don't know, uh, I..."

1131
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:41,950
"He could've been. I mean, maybe, I don't know."

1132
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:44,210
"If you say he's black, maybe he was. I don't know."

1133
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:47,920
We've got white people so scared

1134
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:49,730
to describe things with color,

1135
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,520
we've got them so convinced that they're racist.

1136
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,480
It's awful, because you know, the thing is,

1137
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:56,270
white people will never be as racist as we are.

1138
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:58,490
Not in your life.

1139
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,140
White folks can never be that racist.

1140
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:05,280
Indian people, Asian people, we're all very racist.

1141
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:07,670
Every group is racist.

1142
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,780
White folks will see a group of Indian people.

1143
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,020
They're like, "Oh, look at all those brown people."

1144
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,390
"They're probably all very happy together."

1145
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:15,250
Then you get in that group. We're like, "Hey, you're from India?"

1146
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:16,370
"I'm from India. What part?"

1147
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:18,070
"Oh, not that part. Go to hell, you bloody bastard!"

1148
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:19,150
"I don't want to know you."

1149
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,560
Every group does it.

1150
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:25,950
Asians will do it. Look.

1151
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:27,560
"Oh, I'm Chinese."
"You're Chinese? Where are you from?"

1152
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:29,050
"I'm from Kung Chao."
"I'm from Ow Bay."

1153
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:30,760
"Oh, you go. So stupid. I'll go."

1154
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:33,660
"Oh, that's so bad. I don't like. Don't talk to me, asshole!"

1155
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:41,330
Every culture does it. It's so bizarre, man.

1156
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:42,800
White folks don't have that problem.

1157
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,940
White guy'll see another white guy,

1158
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,760
"Hey, where are you from?"
"I'm from Tennessee. Where you from?"

1159
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,260
"I'm from New York."
"Well, let's have a drink."

1160
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:48,280
"Alright, let's go. Ha ha!"

1161
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:49,520
That's it. They don't care. They just...

1162
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,230
"Hey, look. Another white guy."

1163
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,220
White people, it's OK to be proud of yourselves, you know.

1164
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:56,550
It's OK to feel proud. It's not a bad thing.

1165
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:58,250
I mean, sometimes you get carried away

1166
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:00,520
and then you light crosses and put on pointy white hats, but...

1167
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:04,170
That's-- You know, you should draw the line somewhere before that.

1168
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:05,120
You know what I mean? You should--

1169
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,490
But, white people, you really have, you know,

1170
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:15,280
changed things for yourselves in the past 30 years, you know what I mean?

1171
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:18,250
You've very graciously let immigrants into your country.

1172
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,690
I mean, you know, the country you took.

1173
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:21,190
You know, but whatever. You know what I mean?

1174
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:23,730
Sure, sure, you have a bad history, you know what I mean?

1175
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:25,600
Sure, you stole some land, you know what I mean?

1176
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,650
Big deal. You tried to wipe out a whole race of people.

1177
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:28,240
No problem.

1178
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,270
Alright. You know what I mean?

1179
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:31,810
You brought people in from Africa and fucked them over.

1180
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:33,500
Good deal, you know what I mean? But, you know,

1181
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,150
let's forget about all that.

1182
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:39,310
We're in the 21st century now.

1183
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:40,990
It's time to move on.

1184
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:43,930
I'm glad that you stole this land.

1185
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:45,080
You know why?

1186
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:47,340
'Cause Christopher Columbus was looking for my land.

1187
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:58,550
You know, Christopher Columbus, your <i>Great Discoverer</i>?

1188
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:01,800
He was looking for India when he found North America.

1189
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,470
That jackass was lost.

1190
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:07,410
He wasn't even in the right part of the world.

1191
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:09,890
And he knew this wasn't India.

1192
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:12,020
Why do you think the native people here were called Indians?

1193
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:14,100
'Cause he didn't want to look stupid in front of his whole crew.

1194
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,500
He's like, "Fellas, that must be India."

1195
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:21,060
"And those must be Indians."

1196
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:23,360
Meanwhile we're standing on the shores of India going,

1197
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,820
"Where the hell is Chris?"

1198
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:28,780
"The son of a bitch is late."

1199
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,220
But you really have.

1200
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,030
You know, white folks have been very gracious,

1201
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:44,680
and they've opened up their borders and let the immigrants in,

1202
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,720
and they didn't ask questions.

1203
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,230
They're like, "Alright, come on in, immigrants."

1204
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:50,690
"Become an American with us and settle down and be an American."

1205
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:52,690
"It's all good. Don't worry about it."

1206
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:55,330
We all came in, and white people were very friendly.

1207
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:57,950
"Nice. come on in. Thanks-- thanks for coming."

1208
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:00,400
"Sure, sit down. Have a seat."
You know.

1209
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:02,470
Be an American with us. It's all good.

1210
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:04,210
And you did it very graciously.

1211
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:05,930
You never asked questions, and they never said,

1212
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:07,690
"What do you want here? Here, you get out."

1213
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,650
They never did that. They were just like,

1214
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:09,970
"Come on in, come on. Sit down."

1215
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:11,100
"Be one of us."

1216
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,050
And they did it very nicely, you know what I mean?

1217
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:15,480
And you look at the immigrants, and you say, "Look at all those immigrants,"

1218
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,570
"so happy to be here."

1219
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:19,430
And you think that the immigrants, 'cause they all smile and say,

1220
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:21,070
"Hello, Mr. American, how are you?"

1221
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:23,060
"Good day, sir."

1222
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:26,760
And then you don't realize that every immigrant that's ever come to this country,

1223
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,930
comes to America and talks shit about you.

1224
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,710
Every immigrant, doesn't matter where they come from.

1225
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:34,840
They can come from Europe, they can come from Asia, they come from Africa,

1226
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,260
doesn't matter. The immigrants come here

1227
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:37,960
and they talk shit behind the Americans' backs.

1228
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,830
And I don't like it 'cause I was born in North America,

1229
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:42,240
so it pisses me off.

1230
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:45,140
but I'm telling you, they all do, and they all say the same thing.

1231
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:46,080
It's very irritating.

1232
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,050
You came from England, you probably said it too.

1233
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:49,980
And you're white, lady. See, even white people do it.

1234
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:50,550
See what I mean?

1235
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,390
But every immigrant comes here, you know what the first thing they do is say,

1236
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:56,080
"Oh, Americans have no culture."

1237
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:57,870
That's what they say. That's the first thing--

1238
00:57:57,870 --> 00:58:00,570
My dad used to say it. "Oh, these bloody Americans have no culture."

1239
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,500
I go, "Dad, they have culture. They have their own thing going on,"

1240
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:06,230
"which makes it theirs, which makes it part of their culture,"

1241
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:07,700
"which means, they have culture."

1242
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,850
"No. Show me. What is their culture? What is it? Show me."

1243
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:11,820
"What? What? Whaaat?"

1244
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,040
"Whaaaat?"

1245
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,410
"What's their culture? Hamburgers and hoddogs are not a culture."

1246
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:21,520
I'm like, "First of all, hamburgers and what?"

1247
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,360
"<i>Hoddogs</i>."

1248
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:28,260
"What the hell is 'hoddogs'?"

1249
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:31,160
"Hoddogs, you know, hoddogs?"

1250
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:33,810
"You mean, hot dogs?"

1251
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:36,220
"Don't try to give it a fancy name, now, OK?"

1252
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,510
But, white people, it's not fair.

1253
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:41,690
White Americans, it's not fair that immigrants come here

1254
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:43,020
and tell you that you have no culture

1255
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,590
because you do have things that are your culture.

1256
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:46,190
Black American culture is very distinct.

1257
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:48,160
You can look at it and go, "That's black American culture."

1258
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,120
They don't need to prove anything.

1259
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,750
But the white folks always have something to prove,

1260
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:52,180
and I'm here to tell you you do have a culture.

1261
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:53,990
And it always boils down to music, you know what I mean?

1262
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:56,700
When it comes down to music, white folks, you have your own thing going on.

1263
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,690
And it's not like we didn't enjoy your culture too.

1264
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:01,260
We enjoyed it, but you enjoyed it more than we did

1265
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:03,130
which made it your culture, which made it you.

1266
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,240
You know what I mean? White folks love certain songs

1267
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,050
that we all enjoyed, but white people took it to another level..

1268
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:14,250
White folks tend to like the songs that are like audience participation, you know?

1269
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,010
You know, then they don't have to do a lot.

1270
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,460
"I just go to follow what that guy's doing?"

1271
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:18,460
"That's perfect. We'll do that."

1272
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:23,000
'Cause the jokes are already out there, you know. "White people can't dance."

1273
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:25,550
That's not true. It's not fair. White people can dance.

1274
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:28,140
You just choose to do too many dances at the same time.

1275
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:30,540
That's where the problems kick in, you know what I mean?

1276
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:32,560
You can't salsa and do the running man.

1277
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,850
It just doesn't look right, alright?

1278
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,640
But white folks generally love the audience participation songs.

1279
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:44,180
You know what I mean?

1280
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,140
And we enjoyed 'em too.

1281
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,420
Uh, the Macarena.

1282
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:49,320
I mean, it started off as a Latino thing,

1283
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,690
but then white people got ahold of it, and really ran with it,

1284
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:52,460
you know what I mean?

1285
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,600
They took it and made it theirs, you know what I mean?

1286
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:55,910
We all did the Macarena,

1287
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:57,700
but white people took it to another level. Left foot, right foot.

1288
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:02,560
We went, "That's a white people's dance."

1289
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:04,260
"Good on you, whities."

1290
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:06,340
"Enjoy yourselves."

1291
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,400
'Cause I like to watch them enjoy themselves like that.

1292
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,960
When they hear their music that they like,

1293
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,000
they get this joyous look in their eyes.

1294
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,660
And I love to see people enjoy themselves like that.

1295
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:15,290
There are certain songs. The Macarena.

1296
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:17,650
The chicken dance. That's the white people's song, man.

1297
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:18,650

No, we're gonna stick with the chicken dance for now.

I like the chicken dance. That's a white people's--

[HUMMING THE CHICKEN DANCE]

1304
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:44,730
You ever go to a white wedding and they play the chicken dance?

1305
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:45,860
The minute they play the chicken dance,

1306
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:47,560
that's how you know the dance floor's open.

1307

'Cause white people lose their mind.

The bridesmaids, "Oh, my God, the chicken dance!"

1309
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,630
And the song's tricky 'cause it gets faster.

1310
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:05,450
You never know what's gonna happen next, you know?

1311
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:09,760
And then there's like the song that I believe is like the white--

1312
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,790
the white people's national anthem, you know?

1313
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:16,830
I was walking down Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles,

1314
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:19,130
and there was this nightclub playing this song.

1315
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,260
And they were playing it really loud. You could hear it on the street.

1316
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,630
And white people were walking by and driving by,

1317
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:26,700
and they stopped dead in their tracks

1318
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:28,570
to do the YMCA.

1319
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:35,750
White people lose their mind when they hear the YMCA.

1320
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:39,040
Stopped their cars in the middle of Sunset Boulevard,

1321
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:42,090
got out of their car, and didn't do it like, you know, half-assed. They were like,

1322
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:44,120
They do like this.

1323
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:49,180
I was like, "Wow, this guy's into it."

1324
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:50,830
People were honking their horns. "Move it!"

1325
01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:53,840
"Go around, asshole! I'm doing the YMCA over here!"

And everybody was doing it.

1328

And I saw how much joy was in their eyes.

1329
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:03,110
And I felt so good for the white people at that time, you know?

1330
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:05,270
I saw how much they were enjoying themselves, and I went,

"Yes, white people. Have fun."

1332

Your dad's a Puerto Rican, your mom's black,

1381
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:32,180
they must've whupped your ass for no reason sometimes, huh?

1382
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:35,590
"Hey, son, come here."

1383
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:37,810
"What's that for?"

1384
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:39,900
"I know you did some shit when I wasn't here."

1385
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,920
Mexican parents will do, "Mira!"

1386
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:50,890
They'll beat you, man.

1387
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:53,150
Indian parents aren't afraid to kill their kids if they have to,

1388
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:53,930
you know what I mean?

1389
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:56,680
We're the second largest population in the world.

1390
01:05:57,150 --> 01:05:58,870
Reproduction is not a big deal.

1391
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:01,150
My dad's theory was,

1392
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:03,390
"If I get rid of one, I'll just make another one."

1393
01:06:04,310 --> 01:06:07,010
"Then I'll tell the new one what an idiot the last one was."

1394
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:13,150
You've gotta beat your kids, folks. Please.

1395
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:14,830
I know a lot of white people don't beat them,

1396
01:06:14,830 --> 01:06:16,900
but I don't understand why you won't beat your kids.

1397
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:18,790
Please beat them. If you have kids,

1398
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:21,830
and you haven't beaten them, when you go home tonight,

1399
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:26,390
shit, when you turn off this DVD,

1400
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:28,990
I want you to go into your kid's room and

1401
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:30,520
"Hey, hey, buddy. How you doing?"

1402
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:32,210
"Hey. Sleeping?"

1403
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:33,340
"Yeah?"

1404
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:36,180
"That's good. Have it here?"

1405
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,410
"Uh huh, yeah?"

1406
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:38,910
Whack! Just one below.

1407
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:40,110
Whack, you know.

1408
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:43,320
He's already lying down, he'll sleep it off.

1409
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:44,380
Don't worry about it, alright?

1410
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:48,370
You gotta beat 'em, and I'll tell you why.

1411
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:51,700
Because white kids are now going to school with

1412
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:55,760
with black kids, and brown kids,

1413
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:56,690
and Asian kids,

1414
01:06:56,690 --> 01:07:00,210
and they're going to school with multi-cultural kids.

1415
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,120
And all those kids get beaten.

1416
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:05,700
And they'll all be hanging on the playground,

1417
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:07,940
having fun with each other, you know what I mean? They'll be--

1418
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,950
they'll be talking about the ass-whupping they got last night.

1419
01:07:12,370 --> 01:07:15,180
Black kid, "My dad beat my ass."
Indian kid, "My dad beat my ass, too."

1420
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:17,230
Asians, "I got my ass whupped."

1421
01:07:19,770 --> 01:07:21,750
Do you want that white kid to feel left out?

1422
01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:25,140
Beat him, so he's not a social outcast.

1423
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:27,160
"I got sent to my room."

1424
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:29,030
"You got a room?"

1425
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:36,820
Beat them!

1426
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:39,020
Please. And I'll tell you why you need to beat them. Why else?

1427
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:42,230
Because when--

1428
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:45,060
when white kids hang around non-white kids,

1429
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:47,040
we tend to look at them for advice.

1430
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:52,140
And it could get us murdered if we listen to their fucked up advice

1431
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,810
on how to deal with our parents.

1432
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:56,770
I remember when I was 10 years old,

1433
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:58,550
I hang around this white kid, Ryan.

1434
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:02,540
Ryan's parents never beat him,

1435
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:04,070
and they never even yell at him.

1436
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:05,800
He could do anything he wanted,

1437
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,340
and nothing was gonna happen to him.

1438
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,180
But he was an angry kid.

1439
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:11,590
I walked into his house after school one day, his mom goes,

1440
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:13,570
"Ryan, go clean your room."

1441
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:15,600
"Fuck you, bitch!"

1442
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:25,850
His mom goes, "What am I gonna do with him?"

1443
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,050
Well, beat his ass!

1444
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:35,220
I go, "Ryan, you can't talk to your mom like that."

1445
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:37,070
"Yes I can, she's a fucking idiot!"

1446
01:08:38,110 --> 01:08:39,870
"Don't say that, man. She'll hit you."

1447
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:42,510
"No she won't. She's not allowed to."

1448
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:47,490
"What are you talking about, dude?"

1449
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:48,990
"My parents hit me."

1450
01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:52,430
"Yeah, well, next time they try it, you tell them to fuck off."

1451
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,010
"Are you sure?"

1452
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:07,140
"Trust me. It works for me."

1453
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,470
So I went home

1454
01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:12,270
for the last time.

1455
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:15,780
I walked in the house,

1456
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:17,880
my dad goes, "Russell, come and do the dishes."

1457
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:20,000
"Fuck you, dad!"

1458
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,570
"What the hell did you just said to me?"

1459
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,190
"Do I look like Ryan's mom?"

1460
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:42,910
"Somebody gonna get a hurt real bad."

1461
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:53,920
That was my dad's threat.

1462
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:56,150
Right before he beat me. Every single time.

1463
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:57,110
"Russell,"

1464
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,360
"somebody gonna get a hurt real bad."

1465
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:03,530
I hated that threat. You know why?

1466
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:05,100
'Cause he always say 'somebody.'

1467
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,020
He'd never tell you it's you.

1468
01:10:08,850 --> 01:10:10,680
I mean, you knew it was you.

1469
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:12,540
But he gives you this hope.

1470
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:16,120
"Russell!"

1471
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:19,950
"Somebody gonna get a hurt real bad."

1472
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:22,550
"Somebody."

1473
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:25,610
"I'm not gonna say who."

1474
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:29,160
"Oh, I think you might know him very well."

1475
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:33,500
I'm at the back praying, "I hope it's my brother, man. Please."

1476
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:35,810
"Beat Julio's ass."

1477
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,330
I saw that little brat, Ryan, at school a few days later,

1478
01:10:41,330 --> 01:10:43,690
I was like, "Yo! Your little plan almost got me killed!"

1479
01:10:43,690 --> 01:10:47,370
He goes, "Oh, sorry, dude. I forgot to tell you the other part."

1480
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,820
"If he's still gonna hit you, threaten to phone Child Services."

1481
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:54,060
"Why?"

1482
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:57,970
"'Cause if you phone Child Services, they'll come and take your dad away,"

1483
01:10:57,970 --> 01:11:00,140
"and he'll get in trouble. You won't even have to call,"

1484
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:02,560
"just pretend. It'll scare the shit out of him."

1485
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:05,460
You're 10 years old,

1486
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:07,370
you figured out how to scare the shit out of your dad,

1487
01:11:07,650 --> 01:11:09,200
that's like finding kryptonite.

1488
01:11:10,890 --> 01:11:12,000
I thought I'd try it.

1489
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,150
I was about to get my next beating, I stop my dad and go,

1490
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:15,950
"Don't do it!"

1491
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:20,000
"I'll phone Child Services."

1492
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:25,700
You ever had your parents called your bluff?

1493
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:27,620
"You'll do what?"

1494
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:33,330
"I'll phone Child Services."

1495
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:35,400
"Is that right?"

"What are you doing?"

1499
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:52,070
"If I phone Child Services, you'll get in trouble."

01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:54,390
"I might get into a little bit of trouble."

1501

"But I know that it's going to take them 22 minutes to get here."

"In that time,"
