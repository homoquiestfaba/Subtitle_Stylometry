1
00:01:51,074 --> 00:01:56,512
Henslowe, do you know what happens
to a man who doesn't pay his debts ?

2
00:01:56,594 --> 00:01:58,630
His boots catch fire !

3
00:02:00,794 --> 00:02:02,625
Why do you howl...

4
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:05,228
when it is l who am bitten ?

5
00:02:05,314 --> 00:02:08,112
- What am l, Mr. Lambert ?
- Bitten, Mr. Fennyman.

6
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,025
How badly bitten, Mr. Frees ?

7
00:02:10,114 --> 00:02:12,912
Twelve pounds,
one schilling and fourpence,
Mr. Fennyman, including interest.

8
00:02:12,994 --> 00:02:14,791
- Aaah ! l can pay you !
- When ?

9
00:02:14,874 --> 00:02:17,946
Two weeks ! Three weeks at the most !
Oh, for pity's sake !

10
00:02:18,034 --> 00:02:20,104
Take them out.

11
00:02:20,194 --> 00:02:22,025
Where will you find...

12
00:02:22,114 --> 00:02:23,945
Sixteen pounds,
five schillings and ninepence.

13
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:25,865
lncluding interest,
in three weeks ?

14
00:02:25,954 --> 00:02:28,548
- l have a wonderful new play.
- Put them back in.

15
00:02:28,634 --> 00:02:30,465
- lt's a comedy !
- Cut off his nose.

16
00:02:30,554 --> 00:02:32,988
lt's a new comedy
by William Shakespeare.

17
00:02:34,994 --> 00:02:36,825
- And his ears.
- And a share !

18
00:02:36,914 --> 00:02:38,791
We will be partners,
Mr. Fennyman !

19
00:02:40,674 --> 00:02:42,232
Partners ?

20
00:02:45,954 --> 00:02:48,263
lt's a crowd-tickler.

21
00:02:48,354 --> 00:02:51,710
Mistaken identities.
Shipwreck. Pirate king.

22
00:02:51,794 --> 00:02:54,513
- A bit with a dog, and love triumphant.
- l think l've seen it.

23
00:02:54,594 --> 00:02:56,266
l didn't like it.

24
00:02:56,354 --> 00:02:59,903
- But this time it is by Shakespeare.
- What's it called ?

25
00:02:59,994 --> 00:03:02,667
Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter.

26
00:03:02,754 --> 00:03:04,745
Good title.

27
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:08,031
A play takes time.
Find the actors, rehearsals.

28
00:03:08,114 --> 00:03:10,423
Let's say we open
in two weeks.

29
00:03:10,514 --> 00:03:12,823
That's, what, 500 groundlings
at tuppence a head.

30
00:03:12,914 --> 00:03:16,384
ln addition, 400 backsides at
threepence, a penny extra for cushions.

31
00:03:16,474 --> 00:03:18,351
Call it, uh, 200 cushions.

32
00:03:18,434 --> 00:03:22,029
Say two performances for safety.
How much is that, Mr. Frees ?

33
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:25,106
- Twenty pounds
to the penny, Mr. Fennyman.
- Correct.

34
00:03:25,194 --> 00:03:28,106
- But l have to pay
the actors and the author.
- Share of the profits.

35
00:03:28,194 --> 00:03:30,503
- There's never any--
- Of course not.

36
00:03:30,594 --> 00:03:34,746
Oh-- Oh, Mr. Fennyman, l think you
might have hit upon something.

37
00:03:34,834 --> 00:03:37,223
Sign there.

38
00:03:40,994 --> 00:03:44,430
So, Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter.

39
00:03:44,514 --> 00:03:46,345
Almost finished ?

40
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,790
Oh, without doubt he's completing it
at this very moment.

41
00:04:45,594 --> 00:04:48,472
Will. Will !

42
00:04:49,514 --> 00:04:50,833
Where is my play ?

43
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:54,031
Tell me you have it nearly done.
Tell me you have it started.

44
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:57,390
Doubt that the stars are fire,
doubt that the sun doth move.

45
00:04:57,474 --> 00:05:00,113
No, no, we haven't the time.
Talk prose.

46
00:05:00,194 --> 00:05:02,025
Where is my play ?

47
00:05:02,114 --> 00:05:04,548
- lt is all locked safe in here.
- God be praised.

48
00:05:04,634 --> 00:05:06,431
Locked ?

49
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,711
- As soon as l find my muse.
- Who is she this time ?

50
00:05:09,794 --> 00:05:11,625
She is always Aphrodite.

51
00:05:11,714 --> 00:05:14,353
Aphrodite Baggot, who does it
behind the Dog and Trumpet ?

52
00:05:14,434 --> 00:05:17,392
Henslowe, you have no soul,

53
00:05:17,474 --> 00:05:20,989
so how can you understand
the emptiness that seeks a soul mate ?

54
00:05:21,074 --> 00:05:22,905
Ow ! Will !

55
00:05:22,994 --> 00:05:25,792
l am a dead man,
and buggered to boot.

56
00:05:25,874 --> 00:05:28,183
My theater is closed by the plague
these twelve weeks.

57
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:31,072
My actors are forced to tour
the inn yards of England...

58
00:05:31,154 --> 00:05:33,952
while Mr. Burbage and the Chamberlain's
Men are invited to court...

59
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,832
and receive ten pounds
to play your piece,

60
00:05:36,914 --> 00:05:39,712
written for my theater,
by my writer, at my risk...

61
00:05:39,794 --> 00:05:41,625
when you were green
and grateful.

62
00:05:41,714 --> 00:05:44,512
- What piece ? Richard Crookback ?
- No ! lt's comedy they want.

63
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,425
Like Romeo and Ethel.

64
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:49,312
- Who wrote that ?
- Nobody. You were writing it for me.

65
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:52,192
- l gave you three pound a month since.
- Half what you owe me.

66
00:05:52,274 --> 00:05:54,504
l'm still due for
One Gentleman of Verona.

67
00:05:54,594 --> 00:05:57,870
What is money to you and me ?
l, your patron, you, my wordwright.

68
00:05:57,954 --> 00:05:59,785
When the plague lifts,

69
00:05:59,874 --> 00:06:02,672
Burbage will have a new play
by Christopher Marlowe for the Curtain.

70
00:06:02,754 --> 00:06:04,585
- l will have nothing for the Rose.
- Mr. Henslowe.

71
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:06,505
- Will you lend me 50 pounds ?
- Fifty pounds ?

72
00:06:06,594 --> 00:06:09,392
- What for ?
- Burbage offers me a partnership
in the Chamberlain's Men.

73
00:06:09,474 --> 00:06:12,113
For 50 pounds, my days
as a hired player are over.

74
00:06:12,194 --> 00:06:16,073
Oh, cut out my heart.
Throw my liver to the dogs.

75
00:06:16,154 --> 00:06:17,985
No, then ?

76
00:06:18,074 --> 00:06:20,907
Theaters are handmaidens of the devil !

77
00:06:20,994 --> 00:06:25,351
The players breed lewdness in your wives
and wickedness in your children !

78
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:29,825
And the Rose smells
thusly rank by any name !

79
00:06:29,914 --> 00:06:34,351
l say, a plague
on both their houses !

80
00:06:34,434 --> 00:06:36,265
Where are you going ?

81
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,345
My weekly confession.

82
00:06:43,314 --> 00:06:46,112
Words, words, words.

83
00:06:46,194 --> 00:06:48,503
Once, l had the gift.

84
00:06:48,594 --> 00:06:52,348
l could make love out of words
as a potter makes cups of clay.

85
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:54,265
Love that overthrows empires.

86
00:06:54,354 --> 00:06:57,630
Love that binds two hearts together,
come hellfire and brimstone.

87
00:06:57,714 --> 00:07:01,468
For sixpence a line,
l could cause a riot in a nunnery.

88
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,830
-But now--
-And yet you tell me you lie with women.

89
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:09,073
Black Sue,
Fat Phoebe,

90
00:07:09,154 --> 00:07:13,033
Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress,
Aphrodite, who does it behind--

91
00:07:13,114 --> 00:07:15,787
Yes, now and again.
What of it ?

92
00:07:15,874 --> 00:07:17,387
l have lost my gift.

93
00:07:17,474 --> 00:07:19,783
l am here to help you.

94
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:22,183
Tell me,
in your own words.

95
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:29,510
l-lt's as if
my quill is broken,

96
00:07:29,594 --> 00:07:33,348
as if the organ
of my imagination has dried up,

97
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:36,824
as if the proud tower
of my genius has collapsed.

98
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,666
- lnteresting.
- Nothing comes.

99
00:07:38,754 --> 00:07:40,551
Most interesting.

100
00:07:40,634 --> 00:07:43,273
lt's like trying to pick a lock
with a wet herring.

101
00:07:44,954 --> 00:07:48,742
Tell me, are you lately humbled
in the act of love ?

102
00:07:51,994 --> 00:07:53,712
How long has it been ?

103
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,707
A goodly length in times past,
but lately--

104
00:07:57,794 --> 00:08:01,070
No, no.
You have a wife, children ?

105
00:08:03,674 --> 00:08:05,710
Aye.

106
00:08:06,794 --> 00:08:08,625
l was a lad of 18.

107
00:08:08,714 --> 00:08:11,023
Anne Hathaway was a woman
half as old again.

108
00:08:11,114 --> 00:08:14,026
- A woman of property ?
- She had a cottage.

109
00:08:14,114 --> 00:08:18,665
- One day she was three months
gone with child, so--
- And your relations ?

110
00:08:18,754 --> 00:08:22,269
- On my mother's side, the Ardens.
- No, your marriage bed.

111
00:08:22,354 --> 00:08:25,790
Four years and a hundred miles away
in Stratford.

112
00:08:25,874 --> 00:08:29,503
A cold bed, too,
since the twins were born.

113
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:31,425
Banishment was a blessing.

114
00:08:31,514 --> 00:08:34,950
- So, now you are free to love--
- Yet cannot love, nor write it.

115
00:08:37,554 --> 00:08:41,229
Here is a-- a bangle...

116
00:08:41,314 --> 00:08:44,670
found in Psyche's temple
on Olympus.

117
00:08:44,754 --> 00:08:46,949
Cheap at fourpence.

118
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:51,744
Write your name on a paper
and feed it into the snake.

119
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:53,665
Will it restore my gift ?

120
00:08:53,754 --> 00:08:57,030
The woman who wears the snake will
dream of you, and your gift will return.

121
00:08:57,114 --> 00:09:00,186
Words will flow like a river.

122
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:02,105
See you next week.

123
00:09:03,634 --> 00:09:06,432
- Now where ?
- To the palace at Whitehall.

124
00:09:07,554 --> 00:09:09,784
All right.

125
00:09:11,874 --> 00:09:13,148
Hello, Will.

126
00:09:13,234 --> 00:09:16,146
Prithee, Mr. Kempe. Break a leg.

127
00:09:16,234 --> 00:09:19,863
- You too, good Crab.
- Crab's nervous.
He's never played the palace.

128
00:09:19,954 --> 00:09:22,263
When will you write me
a tragedy, Will ?

129
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:25,551
- l could do it.
- No, they would laugh at Seneca
if you played it.

130
00:09:25,634 --> 00:09:28,751
There is no dog in the first scene,
Mr. Kempe, thank you.

131
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:31,632
- How goes it, Will ?
- l'm still owed money
for this play, Burbage.

132
00:09:31,714 --> 00:09:34,023
Not by me.
l only stole it.

133
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:36,423
My sleeve wants for a button,
Mistress Rosaline.

134
00:09:36,514 --> 00:09:38,823
Where were
my seamstress' eyes ?

135
00:09:38,914 --> 00:09:42,623
- When are you coming over
to the Chamberlain's Men ?
- When l have 50 pounds.

136
00:09:42,714 --> 00:09:46,104
- You writing ?
- A comedy. All but done.

137
00:09:46,194 --> 00:09:48,025
A pirate comedy.

138
00:09:48,114 --> 00:09:50,344
- Wonderful.
- Bring it tomorrow.

139
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:53,983
- lt's for Henslowe.
He paid me. Ten pounds.
- You're a liar.

140
00:09:54,074 --> 00:09:58,590
- He wants Romeo for Ned
and the Admiral's Men.
- Mmm. Ned's wrong for it.

141
00:09:58,674 --> 00:10:01,029
Will ?

142
00:10:01,114 --> 00:10:04,868
- Here's two sovereigns. l'll give you
another two when l see the pages.
- Done.

143
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:06,785
Burbage, l will see you
hanged for a pickpocket.

144
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:09,183
The queen has commanded it.
She loves a comedy.

145
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:11,742
And the Master of the Revels
favors us.

146
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:14,632
And what favor does Mr. Tilney
receive from you ?

147
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,545
- Ask him.
- She comes !

148
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:44,109
Cease to persuade,
my loving Proteus.

149
00:10:44,194 --> 00:10:46,310
Home-keeping youth
have ever homely wits,

150
00:10:46,394 --> 00:10:49,067
were it not affection
chains thy tender days...

151
00:10:52,034 --> 00:10:54,309
When will you write me
a sonnet, Will ?

152
00:10:54,394 --> 00:10:57,704
- l've lost my gift.
- You left it in my bed.

153
00:10:57,794 --> 00:10:59,625
Come to look for it again.

154
00:11:05,314 --> 00:11:09,068
Are you to be my muse,
Rosaline ?

155
00:11:09,154 --> 00:11:12,112
Burbage has my keeping,

156
00:11:12,194 --> 00:11:14,025
but you have my heart.

157
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,511
You see ?
The consumptives plot against me.

158
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,425
Will Shakespeare has a play.

159
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,823
Let's go and cough through it.

160
00:11:24,514 --> 00:11:27,631
My father weeping; my mother wailing;

161
00:11:27,714 --> 00:11:32,265
our maid howling;
our cat wringing her hands.

162
00:11:32,354 --> 00:11:35,585
Yet did not this coldhearted cur...

163
00:11:35,674 --> 00:11:38,472
shed one tear--

164
00:11:50,994 --> 00:11:52,712
You see ? Comedy.

165
00:11:54,194 --> 00:11:56,583
Love, and a bit with a dog.

166
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,665
That's what they want.

167
00:12:06,354 --> 00:12:10,108
He is a stone, a very pebble stone,

168
00:12:10,194 --> 00:12:14,028
and has no more pity in him
than a dog !

169
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:16,912
A Jew would have wept
to have seen our parting.

170
00:12:16,994 --> 00:12:21,670
Now the dog all this while
sheds not a tear, nor speaks a word--

171
00:12:21,754 --> 00:12:24,143
Well played, Master Crab !

172
00:12:24,914 --> 00:12:28,111
l commend you !

173
00:12:30,914 --> 00:12:33,508
What light is light...

174
00:12:33,594 --> 00:12:35,425
if Silvia be not seen ?

175
00:12:36,514 --> 00:12:38,982
What joy is joy...

176
00:12:39,074 --> 00:12:41,224
if Silvia be not by ?

177
00:12:41,314 --> 00:12:44,112
Unless it be to think
that she is by...

178
00:12:44,194 --> 00:12:47,948
and feed upon the shadow
of perfection.

179
00:12:49,474 --> 00:12:52,272
Except l be by Silvia
in the night,

180
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:55,664
there is no music
in the nightingale.

181
00:12:55,754 --> 00:12:58,552
Unless l look on Silvia
in the day,

182
00:12:58,634 --> 00:13:01,910
there is no day for me
to look upon.

183
00:13:24,314 --> 00:13:27,704
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best ?

184
00:13:27,794 --> 00:13:30,592
Proteus for speaking.
Valentine for looks.

185
00:13:30,674 --> 00:13:32,983
Oh, l liked the dog
for laughs.

186
00:13:33,074 --> 00:13:35,383
Silvia, l did not care for much.

187
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:37,305
His fingers were red
from fighting...

188
00:13:37,394 --> 00:13:40,511
and he spoke like
a schoolboy at lessons.

189
00:13:40,594 --> 00:13:43,392
Stage love will never be true love...

190
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:48,309
while the law of the land
has our heroines being played
by pipsqueak boys in petticoats.

191
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,352
- Oh, when can we see another ?
- When the queen commands it.

192
00:13:51,434 --> 00:13:53,265
No, but at the playhouse.
Nurse !

193
00:13:53,354 --> 00:13:56,983
Be still.
Playhouses are not for wellborn ladies.

194
00:13:57,074 --> 00:13:59,224
Oh ! l'm not so wellborn.

195
00:13:59,314 --> 00:14:01,623
Well-monied is the same
as wellborn,

196
00:14:01,714 --> 00:14:04,023
and well-married
is more so.

197
00:14:04,114 --> 00:14:06,423
Lord Wessex
was looking at you tonight.

198
00:14:06,514 --> 00:14:08,823
All the men at court
are without poetry.

199
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:11,712
lf they see me, they see
my father's fortune.

200
00:14:11,794 --> 00:14:15,230
l will have poetry
in my life,

201
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:17,145
and adventure.

202
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:20,794
And love.
Love above all.

203
00:14:20,874 --> 00:14:22,705
Like Valentine
and Silvia ?

204
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:26,503
No, not the artful postures
of love,

205
00:14:26,594 --> 00:14:30,428
but love that overthrows life.

206
00:14:30,514 --> 00:14:34,029
Unbiddable, ungovernable,
like a riot in the heart,

207
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:38,266
and nothing to be done,
come ruin or rapture.

208
00:14:38,354 --> 00:14:41,869
Love as there has never been
in a play.

209
00:14:41,954 --> 00:14:45,708
l will have love,
or l will end my days as--

210
00:14:45,794 --> 00:14:47,625
As a nurse ?

211
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:52,304
Oh, but l would be
Valentine and Silvia too.

212
00:14:52,394 --> 00:14:56,273
Oh, good nurse,
God save you, and good night.

213
00:14:57,594 --> 00:15:00,392
l would stay asleep
my whole life...

214
00:15:00,474 --> 00:15:04,228
if l could dream myself
into a company of players.

215
00:15:04,314 --> 00:15:07,112
Clean your teeth
while you dream, then.

216
00:15:09,954 --> 00:15:12,422
Now spit.

217
00:15:34,754 --> 00:15:38,144
This time the boots
are coming off.

218
00:15:38,234 --> 00:15:41,465
- What have l done ?
- The theaters have all been
closed down by the plague.

219
00:15:41,554 --> 00:15:44,352
- Oh, that.
- By order of the Master of the Revels.

220
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:48,586
Mr. Fennyman, allow me to explain
about the theater business.

221
00:15:48,674 --> 00:15:52,508
The natural condition is one
of insurmountable obstacles on
the road to imminent disaster.

222
00:15:52,594 --> 00:15:55,154
- So what do we do ?
- Nothing.

223
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:58,749
- Strangely enough,
it all turns out well.
- How ?

224
00:15:59,794 --> 00:16:01,625
l don't know.
lt's a mystery.

225
00:16:01,714 --> 00:16:03,545
Shall l kill him, Mr. Fennyman ?

226
00:16:03,634 --> 00:16:05,465
The theaters are reopened...

227
00:16:05,554 --> 00:16:09,069
by order of
the Master of the Revels !

228
00:16:09,154 --> 00:16:12,191
The theaters are reopened !

229
00:16:12,274 --> 00:16:14,105
Mr. Fennyman.

230
00:16:14,194 --> 00:16:16,503
Mr. Tilney has reopened
the playhouses.

231
00:16:16,594 --> 00:16:18,789
lf you wouldn't mind.

232
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:23,225
Where's the play ?

233
00:16:23,314 --> 00:16:26,033
Oh, it's coming.
lt's coming.

234
00:16:28,594 --> 00:16:30,425
lt's coming.

235
00:16:41,154 --> 00:16:42,985
Will !

236
00:16:43,074 --> 00:16:44,905
Will, l have wonderful news.

237
00:16:44,994 --> 00:16:46,825
So have l.
Romeo and Rosaline, scene one.

238
00:16:46,914 --> 00:16:48,745
God, l'm good !

239
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:51,632
Rosaline ?
You mean Ethel.

240
00:16:56,674 --> 00:16:58,505
Richard ?

241
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:01,711
Burbage !

242
00:17:07,954 --> 00:17:09,785
Mr. Tilney.

243
00:17:09,874 --> 00:17:13,389
Like you,
l found him not at home.

244
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,987
l would've made you immortal.

245
00:17:21,154 --> 00:17:24,112
Tell Burbage he has lost
a new play by Will Shakespeare.

246
00:17:24,194 --> 00:17:26,754
What does Burbage care of that ?

247
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:30,429
He's readying the Curtain
for Kit Marlowe.

248
00:17:30,514 --> 00:17:33,631
- You've opened the playhouses ?
- l have, Master Shakespeare.

249
00:17:33,714 --> 00:17:36,592
- But the plague--
- Yes, l know.

250
00:17:36,674 --> 00:17:39,472
But he was always
hanging around the house.

251
00:17:52,874 --> 00:17:56,264
The special today is a pig's
foot marinated in juniper berry vinegar,

252
00:17:56,354 --> 00:17:59,107
- served on a buckwheat pancake--
- Will !

253
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:00,912
Have you finished ?

254
00:18:00,994 --> 00:18:02,825
Yes, nearly.

255
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:05,986
- Good morning, Master Nol.
You will have a nice part.
- Yes !

256
00:18:06,074 --> 00:18:09,953
- We'll need Ralph for the pirate king.
- Clear that bloody table !

257
00:18:11,154 --> 00:18:13,952
None other than the Admiral's Men
are out on tour.

258
00:18:14,074 --> 00:18:16,144
l need actors !

259
00:18:16,234 --> 00:18:19,988
Those of you who are unknown
will have a chance to be known !

260
00:18:20,074 --> 00:18:23,987
- What about the money, Mr. Henslowe ?
- lt won't cost you a penny !

261
00:18:24,074 --> 00:18:26,872
Auditions in half an hour !

262
00:18:31,114 --> 00:18:33,912
Ralph Bagswell,
l'd have a part for you,

263
00:18:33,994 --> 00:18:36,713
but, alas, l hear you are
a drunkard's drunkard.

264
00:18:36,794 --> 00:18:38,625
Never when l'm working.

265
00:18:38,714 --> 00:18:41,387
Never when l'm working !

266
00:18:42,594 --> 00:18:44,550
Get me to drink mandragora.

267
00:18:44,634 --> 00:18:46,465
Straight up, Will ?

268
00:18:46,554 --> 00:18:49,432
Give my friend a beaker
of your best brandy.

269
00:18:49,514 --> 00:18:51,630
Kit.

270
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:55,104
- How goes it, Will ?
- Wonderful. Wonderful.

271
00:18:55,194 --> 00:18:58,664
- Burbage says you have a play.
- l have, and the chinks to show for it.

272
00:18:58,754 --> 00:19:01,393
l insist.
A beaker for Mr. Marlowe.

273
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,272
l hear you have a new play
for the Curtain.

274
00:19:04,354 --> 00:19:06,345
Not new.
My Doctor Faustus.

275
00:19:06,434 --> 00:19:08,789
Ah.
l love your early work.

276
00:19:08,874 --> 00:19:11,672
""Was this the face that
launched a thousand ships...

277
00:19:11,754 --> 00:19:14,188
and burnt the topless towers
of llium ?""

278
00:19:14,274 --> 00:19:17,072
l have a new one
nearly finished, and better.

279
00:19:17,154 --> 00:19:18,985
The Massacre at Paris.

280
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:23,670
- Whew. Good title.
- Mmm. Yours ?

281
00:19:23,754 --> 00:19:26,063
Romeo and Ethel,
the Pirate's Daughter.

282
00:19:27,474 --> 00:19:29,908
Yes, l know. l know.

283
00:19:29,994 --> 00:19:31,825
What is the story ?

284
00:19:31,914 --> 00:19:34,553
Well, there's this pirate--

285
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:39,350
ln truth, l have not written a word.

286
00:19:40,794 --> 00:19:42,830
Romeo.

287
00:19:42,914 --> 00:19:45,872
Romeo is ltalian,

288
00:19:45,954 --> 00:19:48,104
always in and out of love.

289
00:19:48,194 --> 00:19:50,310
Yes, that's good.
Until he meets--

290
00:19:50,394 --> 00:19:52,624
- Ethel.
- Do you think ?

291
00:19:52,714 --> 00:19:55,069
- The daughter of his enemy.
- The daughter of his enemy.

292
00:19:55,154 --> 00:19:57,270
His best friend
is killed in a duel...

293
00:19:57,354 --> 00:20:00,710
by Ethel's brother, or something--
His name is Mercutio.

294
00:20:00,794 --> 00:20:02,625
Mercutio.
Good name.

295
00:20:02,714 --> 00:20:05,990
- Will ! They're waiting for you !
- Yes, l'm coming.

296
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:08,713
Good luck with yours, Kit.

297
00:20:08,794 --> 00:20:12,230
- l thought your play was for Burbage.
- This is a different one.

298
00:20:12,314 --> 00:20:14,225
A different one
you haven't written ?

299
00:20:15,274 --> 00:20:16,912
Was this the face...

300
00:20:16,994 --> 00:20:19,349
that launched a thousand ships...

301
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:21,743
and burnt the topless
towers of llium ?

302
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:23,347
Thank you.

303
00:20:23,434 --> 00:20:25,902
Was this the face that
launched a thousand ships...

304
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:28,588
- and burnt the top--
topless towers of llium ?
- Thank you !

305
00:20:28,674 --> 00:20:30,505
Was this the face...

306
00:20:30,594 --> 00:20:34,030
that launched a thousand ships
and burnt the topless--

307
00:20:34,114 --> 00:20:38,471
l would like to give you something
from Faustus by Christopher Marlowe.

308
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:40,704
- How refreshing.
- ...the topless towers of llium ?

309
00:20:40,794 --> 00:20:43,786
Sweet Helen,
make me immortal with a kiss.

310
00:20:47,034 --> 00:20:48,865
W-Was this the f--

311
00:20:48,954 --> 00:20:51,946
Very good, Mr. Wabash.
Report to the property master.

312
00:20:53,514 --> 00:20:55,505
My tailor wants to be an actor.

313
00:20:55,594 --> 00:20:57,903
l have a few debts
here and there.

314
00:20:57,994 --> 00:20:59,905
Well, that seems
to be everybody.

315
00:20:59,994 --> 00:21:02,303
- Did you see a Romeo ?
- l did not.

316
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,544
Well, l to my work,
you to yours.

317
00:21:04,634 --> 00:21:07,990
Oh, God.

318
00:21:12,234 --> 00:21:14,065
May l begin, sir ?

319
00:21:15,634 --> 00:21:18,751
- Your name ?
- Thomas Kent.

320
00:21:18,834 --> 00:21:23,350
l-l would like to do a speech
by a writer who commands
the heart of every player.

321
00:21:26,074 --> 00:21:31,023
What light is light...

322
00:21:31,114 --> 00:21:33,582
if Silvia be not seen ?

323
00:21:34,954 --> 00:21:39,027
What joy is joy
if Silvia be not by ?

324
00:21:40,394 --> 00:21:42,703
Unless it be to think
that she is by...

325
00:21:42,794 --> 00:21:45,911
and feed upon the shadow
of perfection.

326
00:21:47,914 --> 00:21:52,146
Except l be by Silvia
in the night,

327
00:21:53,194 --> 00:21:55,662
there is no music
in the nightingale.

328
00:21:56,954 --> 00:22:00,788
Unless l look on Silvia
in the day,

329
00:22:00,874 --> 00:22:04,025
there is no day
for me to look upon.

330
00:22:05,354 --> 00:22:09,905
She is my essence,
and l leave to be if l be not--

331
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:13,066
- Take off your hat !
- My hat ?

332
00:22:13,154 --> 00:22:15,827
Where'd you learn
how to do that ?

333
00:22:15,954 --> 00:22:18,024
- l--
- Let me see you. Take off your hat.

334
00:22:18,114 --> 00:22:20,344
- Are you M-Master Shakespeare ?
- Wait there.

335
00:22:20,434 --> 00:22:22,231
Wait there !

336
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:37,951
- Will, w-where are the pages ?
- Where is the boy ?

337
00:22:39,914 --> 00:22:44,032
B-B-B-Break a leg !

338
00:22:47,594 --> 00:22:50,392
Sir, will you buy
my sweet orange ?

339
00:23:08,114 --> 00:23:09,945
Hey !

340
00:23:26,994 --> 00:23:29,303
Everybody ready ? All away !

341
00:23:30,514 --> 00:23:33,392
- Follow that boat !
- Right you are, governor.

342
00:23:37,674 --> 00:23:41,144
l know your face.
Are you an actor ?

343
00:23:41,234 --> 00:23:44,351
- Yes.
- Yes, l think l've
seen you in something.

344
00:23:44,434 --> 00:23:47,232
- That one about a king.
- Really ?

345
00:23:47,314 --> 00:23:50,112
l had that Christopher Marlowe
in my boat once.

346
00:24:02,034 --> 00:24:05,913
- Do you know that house ?
- Sir Robert De Lesseps.

347
00:24:15,594 --> 00:24:19,382
Where is she ? Our guests are upon us !

348
00:24:19,474 --> 00:24:23,228
Lord Wessex, too,
bargaining for a bride.

349
00:24:23,314 --> 00:24:26,192
My husband will have it
settled tonight.

350
00:24:26,274 --> 00:24:28,629
Stamped, sealed
and celebrated.

351
00:24:28,714 --> 00:24:31,786
Tomorrow he drags me off
to the country,

352
00:24:31,874 --> 00:24:34,672
and it will be three weeks gone
before we return from our estates.

353
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:39,703
God save you, Mother.

354
00:24:39,794 --> 00:24:42,592
Hot water, Nurse.

355
00:24:45,714 --> 00:24:47,386
l seek Master Thomas Kent.

356
00:24:47,474 --> 00:24:49,305
- Who, sir ?
- The actor.

357
00:24:49,394 --> 00:24:51,624
- Who asks for him ?
- Will Shakespeare.

358
00:24:51,714 --> 00:24:53,625
Poet, playwright of the Rose.

359
00:24:53,714 --> 00:24:56,023
Master Kent...

360
00:24:56,114 --> 00:24:59,072
is my nephew.

361
00:24:59,154 --> 00:25:00,985
l will wait.

362
00:25:01,074 --> 00:25:03,383
Much good may it do you.

363
00:25:06,674 --> 00:25:08,824
""Romeo Montague,

364
00:25:08,914 --> 00:25:10,745
a Young Man of Verona.""

365
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:12,665
Verona again ?

366
00:25:12,754 --> 00:25:14,585
""A comedy
of quarreling families...

367
00:25:14,674 --> 00:25:16,824
reconciled in
the discovery of Romeo...

368
00:25:16,914 --> 00:25:19,223
to be the very same
Capulet cousin...

369
00:25:19,314 --> 00:25:22,943
stolen from the cradle and fostered
to manhood by his Montague mother...

370
00:25:23,034 --> 00:25:27,312
that was robbed of her own child
by the pirate king.""

371
00:25:27,394 --> 00:25:29,225
Your mother and your father--

372
00:25:29,314 --> 00:25:32,112
From tomorrow,
away in the country for three weeks !

373
00:25:32,194 --> 00:25:34,503
ls Master Shakespeare not handsome ?

374
00:25:34,594 --> 00:25:37,392
- He looks well enough for a charlatan.
- Oh, Nurse !

375
00:25:37,474 --> 00:25:39,305
He would give Thomas Kent...

376
00:25:39,394 --> 00:25:41,225
the life of
Viola De Lesseps' dreaming.

377
00:25:41,314 --> 00:25:43,623
My lady, when your parents return,
l will tell.

378
00:25:43,714 --> 00:25:45,545
You will not tell.

379
00:25:45,634 --> 00:25:47,784
As l love you and you love me,

380
00:25:47,874 --> 00:25:50,672
you will bind my breast
and buy me a boy's wig.

381
00:25:56,434 --> 00:25:58,470
Master Plum.
What business here ?

382
00:25:58,554 --> 00:26:00,385
The five schilling business, Will.

383
00:26:00,474 --> 00:26:02,544
We play for the dancing.

384
00:26:04,554 --> 00:26:07,022
Hyah ! Hyah, hyah !

385
00:26:20,594 --> 00:26:22,425
l seek Master Thomas Kent.

386
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:25,904
Musicians don't eat.
Sir Robert's orders.

387
00:26:25,994 --> 00:26:27,825
She's a beauty, my lord,

388
00:26:27,914 --> 00:26:31,623
as would take a king to church
for the dowry of a nutmeg.

389
00:26:31,714 --> 00:26:34,990
My plantations in Virginia
are not mortgaged for a nutmeg.

390
00:26:35,074 --> 00:26:37,872
l have an ancient name
which will bring you preferment...

391
00:26:37,954 --> 00:26:39,785
when your grandson is a Wessex.

392
00:26:39,874 --> 00:26:41,751
- ls she fertile ?
- Oh, she will breed.

393
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:45,429
- lf she do not, send her back.
- ls she obedient ?

394
00:26:45,514 --> 00:26:47,345
As any mule in Christendom.

395
00:26:47,434 --> 00:26:50,232
But if you are the man to ride her,

396
00:26:50,314 --> 00:26:52,145
there are rubies in the saddlebag.

397
00:26:52,234 --> 00:26:54,464
l like her.

398
00:27:13,154 --> 00:27:15,622
By all the stars in heaven.

399
00:27:15,714 --> 00:27:17,909
Who is she ?

400
00:27:17,994 --> 00:27:21,304
Viola De Lesseps ? Dream on, Will.

401
00:27:57,874 --> 00:27:59,671
Master Shakespeare.

402
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,265
My lady Viola.

403
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,185
My lord.

404
00:28:10,274 --> 00:28:12,583
l have spoken with your father.

405
00:28:12,674 --> 00:28:15,472
So, my lord ?
l speak with him every day.

406
00:28:31,954 --> 00:28:33,626
Good sir.

407
00:28:35,154 --> 00:28:37,065
l heard you were a poet.

408
00:28:40,754 --> 00:28:43,063
A poet of no words ?

409
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:49,864
Poet ?

410
00:28:49,954 --> 00:28:53,913
l was a poet till now, but l've seen
beauty that puts my poems...

411
00:28:53,994 --> 00:28:56,986
at one with the talking ravens
in the Tower.

412
00:28:57,074 --> 00:29:00,146
- How do l offend, my lord ?
- By coveting my property.

413
00:29:00,234 --> 00:29:03,385
l cannot shed blood in her house,
but l will cut your throat anon.

414
00:29:03,474 --> 00:29:05,783
Do you have a name ?

415
00:29:05,874 --> 00:29:08,513
Christopher Marlowe,
at your service.

416
00:29:31,314 --> 00:29:33,953
Romeo. Romeo.

417
00:29:34,034 --> 00:29:36,832
A Young Man of Verona.

418
00:29:36,914 --> 00:29:39,553
A comedy by William Shakespeare.

419
00:29:39,634 --> 00:29:42,592
- My lady !
- Who is there ?

420
00:29:43,634 --> 00:29:45,431
- Will Shakespeare.
- Madam !

421
00:29:45,514 --> 00:29:48,790
Anon, good nurse, anon.

422
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:53,304
- Oh, Master Shakespeare.
- The same, alas.

423
00:29:53,394 --> 00:29:54,986
But why ""alas"" ?

424
00:29:55,074 --> 00:29:56,951
- A lowly player.
- Alas, indeed.

425
00:29:57,034 --> 00:29:59,628
For l thought you
the highest poet of my esteem...

426
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,274
and a writer of plays
that capture my heart.

427
00:30:02,354 --> 00:30:04,663
- Oh, l am him too.
- Madam !

428
00:30:04,754 --> 00:30:07,552
Anon !
l will come again.

429
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:12,384
Oh, l am fortune's fool.
l will be punished for this.

430
00:30:14,594 --> 00:30:17,108
Oh, my lady, my love !

431
00:30:17,194 --> 00:30:20,345
lf they find you here,
they will kill you.

432
00:30:20,434 --> 00:30:23,790
- You can bring them with a word.
- Oh, not for the world.

433
00:30:23,874 --> 00:30:26,911
- Madam !
- Anon !

434
00:31:23,594 --> 00:31:25,425
Draw, if you be men !

435
00:31:25,514 --> 00:31:27,345
Gregory, remember thy swashing blow !

436
00:31:27,434 --> 00:31:30,710
Part, fools ! Put up your swords.
You know not what you do.

437
00:31:30,794 --> 00:31:33,592
lt starts well, then it's all long-faced
about some Rosaline.

438
00:31:33,674 --> 00:31:35,983
Where's the comedy, Will ?
Where's the dog ?

439
00:31:36,074 --> 00:31:37,905
Do you think it's funny ?

440
00:31:37,994 --> 00:31:40,792
l was a pirate king, now l'm a nurse.
That's funny.

441
00:31:40,874 --> 00:31:43,593
We are six men short, and those we
have will be overparted ranters...

442
00:31:43,674 --> 00:31:45,983
and stutterers who should be
sent back to the stews.

443
00:31:46,074 --> 00:31:48,383
My Romeo's let me down.
l see disaster.

444
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:50,908
We are four acts short,
if you're looking for disaster.

445
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:52,825
- Sir !
- Who are you, master ?

446
00:31:52,914 --> 00:31:56,429
l'm Ethel, sir,
the pirate's daughter.

447
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:58,345
l'll be damned if you are !

448
00:31:58,434 --> 00:32:02,586
Your attention, please !

449
00:32:02,674 --> 00:32:05,950
- Gentlemen, thank you !
- You are welcome.

450
00:32:06,034 --> 00:32:08,502
- Who's that ?
- Nobody. He's the author.

451
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:11,552
We are about to embark
on a great voyage.

452
00:32:11,634 --> 00:32:14,910
lt is customary to make a little speech
on the first day.

453
00:32:14,994 --> 00:32:17,303
lt does no harm.
Authors like it.

454
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:20,591
You want to know what parts you are
to receive. All will be settled as we--

455
00:32:20,674 --> 00:32:22,505
l'll do it.

456
00:32:22,594 --> 00:32:24,903
Now listen to me, you dregs.

457
00:32:24,994 --> 00:32:26,825
Actors are ten a penny,

458
00:32:26,914 --> 00:32:30,589
and l, Hugh Fennyman,
hold your nuts in my hand.

459
00:32:30,674 --> 00:32:32,744
Huzzah !

460
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:36,270
The Admiral's Men
are returned to the house !

461
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,265
Huzzah !

462
00:32:41,554 --> 00:32:44,352
Henslowe !

463
00:32:44,434 --> 00:32:46,265
Earl ! Good to see you.

464
00:32:49,394 --> 00:32:51,066
Who is this ?

465
00:32:51,154 --> 00:32:53,952
Silence, you dog !

466
00:32:55,034 --> 00:32:56,786
l am Hieronimo.

467
00:32:56,874 --> 00:32:59,388
l am Tamburlaine.

468
00:32:59,474 --> 00:33:01,624
l am Faustus.

469
00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:05,468
l am Barabbas,
the Jew of Malta.

470
00:33:06,674 --> 00:33:09,472
Oh, yes, Master Will.
l am Henry the Sixth.

471
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:13,547
What is the play,
and what is my part ?

472
00:33:13,634 --> 00:33:15,943
- Uh, one moment, sir--
- Who are you ?

473
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:19,872
l'm, um--
l'm the money.

474
00:33:19,954 --> 00:33:21,785
Then you may remain,

475
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,705
so long as you remain silent.

476
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:26,752
Pay attention. You will see
how genius creates a legend.

477
00:33:26,834 --> 00:33:30,429
- Thank you, sir.
- We are in desperate want
of a Mercutio, Ned.

478
00:33:30,514 --> 00:33:32,982
A young nobleman of Verona.

479
00:33:33,074 --> 00:33:34,905
- And the title of this piece ?
- Mercutio.

480
00:33:34,994 --> 00:33:37,462
ls it ?

481
00:33:37,554 --> 00:33:39,943
l will play him.

482
00:33:41,034 --> 00:33:43,832
Mr. Pope. Mr. Philips.
Welcome.

483
00:33:43,914 --> 00:33:45,711
George Bryan.
James Armitage.

484
00:33:45,794 --> 00:33:47,625
Sam, my pretty one !

485
00:33:47,714 --> 00:33:51,548
- Are you ready to fall in love again ?
- l am, Master Shakespeare.

486
00:33:51,634 --> 00:33:53,750
Your voice.
Have they dropped ?

487
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:56,143
No ! No.
A touch of cold only.

488
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:59,704
Master Henslowe, you have your actors...
except Thomas Kent.

489
00:34:00,834 --> 00:34:03,189
l, uh, l saw his Tamburlaine,
you know.

490
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,105
- lt was wonderful.
- Yes, l saw it.

491
00:34:05,194 --> 00:34:07,025
Of course,
such mighty writing.

492
00:34:07,114 --> 00:34:09,105
There's no one like Marlowe.

493
00:34:22,674 --> 00:34:24,187
Better fortune, boy.

494
00:34:24,274 --> 00:34:26,105
l was in a play.

495
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:28,628
They cut my head off
in Titus Andronicus.

496
00:34:28,714 --> 00:34:32,309
When l write plays,
they'll be like Titus.

497
00:34:32,394 --> 00:34:33,793
You admire it.

498
00:34:33,874 --> 00:34:35,865
l liked it
when they cut heads off,

499
00:34:35,954 --> 00:34:38,752
and the daughter
mutilated with knives.

500
00:34:38,834 --> 00:34:40,790
- What's your name ?
- John Webster.

501
00:34:40,874 --> 00:34:42,830
Here, kitty, kitty.

502
00:34:45,794 --> 00:34:49,230
Plenty of blood.

503
00:34:49,314 --> 00:34:51,145
That's the only writing.

504
00:34:52,234 --> 00:34:54,543
l have to get back.

505
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:57,626
See, where he comes.
So please you step aside.

506
00:34:57,714 --> 00:34:59,545
l'll know his grievance,
or be much denied.

507
00:34:59,634 --> 00:35:02,910
l would thou wert so happy by thy stay
to hear true shrift. Come, madam.

508
00:35:02,994 --> 00:35:04,825
- Cut around him for now.
- What ? Who ?

509
00:35:04,914 --> 00:35:07,223
- Romeo.
- The one who came with your letter.

510
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:09,145
- What ?
- Good morrow, cousin.

511
00:35:09,234 --> 00:35:11,065
ls the day so young ?

512
00:35:11,154 --> 00:35:14,191
- But new struck nine.
- Ay me. Sad hours seem long.

513
00:35:14,274 --> 00:35:17,072
What sadness
lengthens Romeo's hours ?

514
00:35:17,154 --> 00:35:19,463
Not having that which having
makes them short.

515
00:35:19,554 --> 00:35:21,385
- Good.
- ln love ?

516
00:35:21,474 --> 00:35:23,226
- Out.
- Of love ?

517
00:35:23,314 --> 00:35:27,068
- Out of her favor where l am in love.
- Don't spend it all at once.

518
00:35:29,314 --> 00:35:31,145
Yes, sir.

519
00:35:31,234 --> 00:35:33,953
- Do you understand me ?
- No, sir.

520
00:35:34,034 --> 00:35:37,151
You're speaking about
a baggage we never even meet.

521
00:35:37,234 --> 00:35:40,351
What will be left in his purse
when he meets his Juliet ?

522
00:35:40,434 --> 00:35:42,345
- Juliet ? You mean Ethel.
- God's teeth !

523
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:45,710
Am l to suffer this constant stream
of interruption ?

524
00:35:47,234 --> 00:35:50,351
What will he do in Act Two,
when he meets the love of his life ?

525
00:35:52,194 --> 00:35:56,267
l-l'm very sorry, sir.
l have not seen Act Two.

526
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:59,312
Of course you have not.
l have not written it.

527
00:35:59,394 --> 00:36:01,225
Go once more.

528
00:36:01,314 --> 00:36:03,032
Will.

529
00:36:03,114 --> 00:36:05,389
Where is Mercutio ?

530
00:36:05,474 --> 00:36:08,272
Locked safe in here. l'll leave
the scene in your safekeeping, Ned.

531
00:36:08,354 --> 00:36:10,185
l have a sonnet to write.

532
00:36:10,274 --> 00:36:12,265
Sonnet ?
You mean a play !

533
00:36:15,994 --> 00:36:18,554
For Lady Viola De Lesseps,

534
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:22,388
by the hand of Thomas Kent.

535
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:25,113
""Shall l compare thee
to a summer's day ?

536
00:36:25,194 --> 00:36:28,504
Thou art more lovely
and more temperate.

537
00:36:31,154 --> 00:36:33,952
Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May--""

538
00:36:34,034 --> 00:36:35,945
Two hours at prayer !

539
00:36:36,034 --> 00:36:38,343
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.

540
00:36:38,434 --> 00:36:40,265
Piety is for Sunday !

541
00:36:40,354 --> 00:36:43,152
And two hours of prayer is not piety,
it is self-importance.

542
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:45,953
lt would be better
that you return tomorrow, my lord.

543
00:36:46,034 --> 00:36:48,673
lt would be better if you'd
tell her to get off her knees
and show some civility...

544
00:36:48,754 --> 00:36:50,665
to her six-day
lord and master !

545
00:36:53,154 --> 00:36:54,872
Mmmph !

546
00:36:59,914 --> 00:37:02,109
My lady Viola.

547
00:37:02,194 --> 00:37:04,503
Lord Wessex.
You've been waiting.

548
00:37:04,594 --> 00:37:06,425
l am aware of it.

549
00:37:07,634 --> 00:37:09,465
But it is
beauty's privilege.

550
00:37:09,554 --> 00:37:11,545
You flatter, my lord.

551
00:37:11,634 --> 00:37:15,229
No. l have spoken
to the queen.

552
00:37:15,314 --> 00:37:18,431
Her Majesty's consent is requisite
when a Wessex takes a wife,

553
00:37:18,514 --> 00:37:21,312
and once given,
her consent is her command.

554
00:37:21,394 --> 00:37:23,703
Do you intend to marry,
my lord ?

555
00:37:23,794 --> 00:37:25,944
Your father should keep you
better informed.

556
00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:28,343
He has bought me for you.

557
00:37:28,434 --> 00:37:32,825
He returns from his estates to see us
married two weeks from Saturday.

558
00:37:32,914 --> 00:37:35,030
You are allowed
to show your pleasure.

559
00:37:36,514 --> 00:37:39,312
But l do not love you,
my lord.

560
00:37:39,394 --> 00:37:42,033
How your mind hops about.

561
00:37:42,114 --> 00:37:44,344
Your father
was a shopkeeper.

562
00:37:44,434 --> 00:37:46,709
Your children will bear arms,
and l will recover my fortune.

563
00:37:46,794 --> 00:37:49,149
That is the only matter
under discussion today.

564
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:51,065
You will like Virginia.

565
00:37:51,154 --> 00:37:53,622
- Virginia ?
- Oh, yes.

566
00:37:53,714 --> 00:37:56,672
My fortune lies in my plantations.
The tobacco weed.

567
00:37:56,754 --> 00:38:00,144
l need 4,000 pounds to fit out a ship
and put my investments to work.

568
00:38:00,234 --> 00:38:03,032
l fancy tobacco
has a future.

569
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,947
We will not stay there long.
Three or four years.

570
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,343
But why me ?

571
00:38:08,434 --> 00:38:10,265
lt was your eyes.

572
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:12,629
No, your lips.

573
00:38:23,394 --> 00:38:26,192
Will you defy your father
and your queen ?

574
00:38:26,274 --> 00:38:28,105
The queen has consented ?

575
00:38:28,194 --> 00:38:30,025
She wants to inspect you.

576
00:38:30,114 --> 00:38:32,582
At Greenwich, come Sunday.

577
00:38:32,674 --> 00:38:36,826
Be submissive,
modest, grateful...

578
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:38,745
and brief.

579
00:38:40,194 --> 00:38:43,152
l will do my duty, my lord.

580
00:38:47,554 --> 00:38:52,105
""Master Will, poet dearest to my heart,

581
00:38:52,194 --> 00:38:55,948
l beseech you
banish me from yours.

582
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:59,151
l am to marry Lord Wessex.

583
00:39:00,194 --> 00:39:02,503
A daughter's duty...

584
00:39:02,594 --> 00:39:04,903
and the queen's command.""

585
00:39:25,234 --> 00:39:29,227
Gentlemen upstage
Ladies downstage

586
00:39:31,114 --> 00:39:34,584
Gentlemen upstage
Ladies downstage

587
00:39:34,674 --> 00:39:37,791
Are you a lady Mr. Kent

588
00:39:37,874 --> 00:39:39,546
l'm very sorry, sir.

589
00:39:42,034 --> 00:39:44,832
We're gonna have to do it again.

590
00:39:46,114 --> 00:39:48,423
You did not like the speech ?

591
00:39:48,514 --> 00:39:50,345
No, the speech is excellent.

592
00:39:50,434 --> 00:39:53,949
""Oh, then l see Queen Mab
hath been with you.""

593
00:39:54,034 --> 00:39:56,184
Excellent,
and a good length.

594
00:39:56,274 --> 00:40:00,472
But then he disappears
for the length of a bible.

595
00:40:01,594 --> 00:40:03,710
There.
You have this duel.

596
00:40:03,794 --> 00:40:07,423
A skirmish of words and swords
such as l never wrote, nor anyone.

597
00:40:07,514 --> 00:40:12,349
He dies with such passion
and poetry as you ever heard.

598
00:40:12,434 --> 00:40:15,073
""A plague
on both your houses !""

599
00:40:20,354 --> 00:40:22,185
He dies ?

600
00:40:25,114 --> 00:40:27,469
- Ohh !
- Will !

601
00:40:27,554 --> 00:40:29,465
Where are my pages ?

602
00:40:41,154 --> 00:40:43,065
Did you give her my letter ?

603
00:40:44,274 --> 00:40:46,708
And this is for you !

604
00:40:59,114 --> 00:41:02,265
Oh, Thomas,
she has cut my strings.

605
00:41:03,634 --> 00:41:05,465
l'm unmanned,

606
00:41:05,554 --> 00:41:08,512
unmended and unmade,

607
00:41:08,594 --> 00:41:10,425
like a puppet in a box.

608
00:41:10,514 --> 00:41:12,505
- Writer, is he ?
- Row your boat !

609
00:41:12,594 --> 00:41:14,744
She tells me to keep away.

610
00:41:14,834 --> 00:41:17,951
She is to marry Lord Wessex !
What should l do ?

611
00:41:18,034 --> 00:41:20,832
lf you love her,
you must do as she asks.

612
00:41:20,914 --> 00:41:23,712
- And break her heart and mine ?
- lt is only yours you can know.

613
00:41:23,794 --> 00:41:25,625
She loves me, Thomas !

614
00:41:25,714 --> 00:41:27,545
- Does she say so ?
- No.

615
00:41:27,634 --> 00:41:30,432
And yet she does where
the ink has run with tears.

616
00:41:30,514 --> 00:41:33,790
- Was she weeping
when she gave you this ?
- Uh--

617
00:41:33,874 --> 00:41:36,513
- Her letter came to me by the nurse.
- Your aunt.

618
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,425
Yes, my aunt.

619
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,223
But perhaps
she wept a little.

620
00:41:44,434 --> 00:41:46,584
Tell me how
you love her, Will.

621
00:41:46,674 --> 00:41:50,223
Like a sickness
and its cure together.

622
00:41:50,314 --> 00:41:52,703
Oh, yes.

623
00:41:52,794 --> 00:41:55,069
Like rain and sun.

624
00:41:55,154 --> 00:41:57,622
Like cold and heat.

625
00:41:58,674 --> 00:42:00,426
ls your lady beautiful ?

626
00:42:00,514 --> 00:42:03,950
Since l came here from the country,

627
00:42:04,034 --> 00:42:05,865
l have not seen her close.

628
00:42:05,954 --> 00:42:08,752
Tell me, is--
is she beautiful ?

629
00:42:08,834 --> 00:42:12,383
Thomas, if l could write
with the beauty of her eyes,

630
00:42:12,474 --> 00:42:15,227
l was born to look in them
and know myself.

631
00:42:16,354 --> 00:42:18,914
A-A-And her lips ?

632
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,825
Her lips ?

633
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:24,270
The early morning rose would whither
on the branch if it could feel envy.

634
00:42:24,354 --> 00:42:26,914
And her voice,
like lark's song ?

635
00:42:26,994 --> 00:42:29,792
Deeper, softer.
None of your twittering larks.

636
00:42:29,874 --> 00:42:33,310
l would banish nightingales from her
garden before they interrupt her song.

637
00:42:33,394 --> 00:42:35,954
- Ah, she sings too ?
- Constantly.

638
00:42:36,034 --> 00:42:39,265
Without doubt. And plays the lute.
She has a natural ear.

639
00:42:39,354 --> 00:42:41,310
And her bosom.

640
00:42:41,394 --> 00:42:43,464
Did l mention her bosom ?

641
00:42:43,554 --> 00:42:45,272
What of her bosom ?

642
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,822
Oh, Thomas,
a pair of pippins...

643
00:42:47,914 --> 00:42:50,712
as round and rare
as golden apples.

644
00:42:50,794 --> 00:42:53,627
l think milady is wise
to keep your love at a distance.

645
00:42:53,714 --> 00:42:56,990
For what lady could live up
to it close to...

646
00:42:57,074 --> 00:43:01,272
when her eyes and lips and voice
may be no more beautiful than mine.

647
00:43:01,354 --> 00:43:04,027
Besides, can a--

648
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:06,389
can a lady of wealth
and noble marriage...

649
00:43:06,474 --> 00:43:09,591
love happily with
a bankside poet and player ?

650
00:43:09,674 --> 00:43:11,869
Yes, by God !

651
00:43:11,954 --> 00:43:14,593
Love knows nothing
of rank or riverbank.

652
00:43:14,674 --> 00:43:17,711
lt will spark between a queen and
the poor vagabond who plays the king.

653
00:43:17,794 --> 00:43:20,103
Their love
should be minded by each,

654
00:43:20,194 --> 00:43:22,754
for love denied blights
the soul we owe to God.

655
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:25,712
So tell my lady William Shakespeare
waits for her in the garden.

656
00:43:25,794 --> 00:43:27,625
But what of Lord Wessex ?

657
00:43:27,714 --> 00:43:30,990
For one kiss l would defy
a thousand Wessexes.

658
00:43:38,594 --> 00:43:40,505
Oh, Will.

659
00:43:41,554 --> 00:43:44,022
Thank you, my lady.

660
00:43:45,394 --> 00:43:47,225
Lady ?

661
00:43:47,314 --> 00:43:50,112
Viola De Lesseps.
Known her since she was this high.

662
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:52,310
Wouldn't deceive a child.

663
00:43:54,314 --> 00:43:58,432
Strangely enough,
l'm a bit of a writer meself.

664
00:43:58,514 --> 00:44:00,982
lt wouldn't take you long
to read it.

665
00:44:01,074 --> 00:44:03,668
l expect you'd know
all the booksellers !

666
00:44:11,914 --> 00:44:13,745
Can you love a fool ?

667
00:44:13,834 --> 00:44:16,507
Can you love a player ?

668
00:44:23,634 --> 00:44:25,784
Wait !

669
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:29,469
You're still a maid,
and perhaps as mistook in me
as l was mistook in Thomas Kent.

670
00:44:29,554 --> 00:44:32,193
Are you the author of the plays
of William Shakespeare ?

671
00:44:32,274 --> 00:44:33,787
l am.

672
00:44:33,874 --> 00:44:36,672
Then kiss me again,
for l am not mistook.

673
00:44:49,194 --> 00:44:51,992
l do not know
how to undress a man.

674
00:44:52,074 --> 00:44:53,905
lt is strange to me too.

675
00:46:04,834 --> 00:46:06,825
Go to. Go to.

676
00:46:13,434 --> 00:46:15,584
l would not
have thought it.

677
00:46:16,794 --> 00:46:19,592
There is something
better than a play.

678
00:46:19,674 --> 00:46:22,142
There is.

679
00:46:22,234 --> 00:46:24,543
Even your play.

680
00:46:26,554 --> 00:46:28,385
Oh ?

681
00:46:29,634 --> 00:46:32,102
And that was only
my first try.

682
00:46:47,954 --> 00:46:49,785
Will.

683
00:46:51,794 --> 00:46:54,103
You would not leave me.

684
00:46:54,194 --> 00:46:56,503
l must.

685
00:46:56,594 --> 00:46:58,425
Look how pale the window.

686
00:46:58,514 --> 00:47:00,345
Moonlight.

687
00:47:00,434 --> 00:47:03,187
Mmm, no.
The morning rooster woke me.

688
00:47:03,274 --> 00:47:06,232
lt was the owl.
Come to bed.

689
00:47:08,234 --> 00:47:10,543
Oh, let Henslowe wait.

690
00:47:12,394 --> 00:47:14,225
Mr. Henslowe ?

691
00:47:14,314 --> 00:47:16,623
Mmm, let him be damned
for his pages.

692
00:47:16,714 --> 00:47:18,545
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

693
00:47:18,634 --> 00:47:21,432
There is time. Mmm !
lt is still dark.

694
00:47:21,514 --> 00:47:24,312
- lt's broad day.
The rooster tells us so.
- lt was the owl.

695
00:47:24,394 --> 00:47:26,589
Believe me, love, it was the owl--

696
00:47:27,954 --> 00:47:30,752
You would leave us players
without a scene to read today ?

697
00:47:33,474 --> 00:47:35,988
My lady ?

698
00:47:36,074 --> 00:47:38,713
The house is stirring.
lt is a new day.

699
00:47:39,754 --> 00:47:42,063
lt is a new world.

700
00:47:42,154 --> 00:47:44,952
Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much,

701
00:47:45,034 --> 00:47:47,548
which mannerly devotion
shows in this.

702
00:47:47,634 --> 00:47:50,706
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch,

703
00:47:50,794 --> 00:47:54,070
and palm to palm
is holy palmers' kiss.

704
00:47:54,154 --> 00:47:57,703
Have not saints lips,
and holy palmers too ?

705
00:47:57,794 --> 00:47:59,625
Aye, pilgrim.

706
00:47:59,714 --> 00:48:02,023
Lips that they must use
in prayer.

707
00:48:02,114 --> 00:48:05,151
Oh, then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do.

708
00:48:05,234 --> 00:48:07,065
They pray.

709
00:48:07,154 --> 00:48:10,430
Grant thou, lest faith
turn to despair.

710
00:48:10,514 --> 00:48:13,790
Saints do not move,
though grant for prayers' sake.

711
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,265
lt's you.

712
00:48:17,354 --> 00:48:19,663
Suffering cats !

713
00:48:19,754 --> 00:48:21,745
Then move not...

714
00:48:21,834 --> 00:48:24,746
while my prayer's effect
l take.

715
00:48:28,914 --> 00:48:32,190
Thus from my lips,
by thine my sin is purged.

716
00:48:32,274 --> 00:48:34,913
Then have my lips
the sin that they have took.

717
00:48:34,994 --> 00:48:39,545
Sin from my lips ? Oh, trespass
sweetly urged. Give me my sin again.

718
00:48:39,634 --> 00:48:42,148
Yes, yes !
Um, not quite right.

719
00:48:42,234 --> 00:48:44,145
lt is more--
Let me.

720
00:48:44,234 --> 00:48:47,067
Then have my lips
the sin that they have took.

721
00:48:47,154 --> 00:48:51,272
Sin from my lips ? Oh, trespass
sweetly urged. Give me my sin again.

722
00:48:57,474 --> 00:48:59,908
- You kiss by the book.
- Well, Will !

723
00:48:59,994 --> 00:49:01,985
lt was lucky you were here.

724
00:49:02,074 --> 00:49:04,383
- Why do not l write
the rest of your play--
- Yes, yes !

725
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:08,513
Uh, continue. Now the nurse.
Where is Ralph ?

726
00:49:08,794 --> 00:49:12,309
Madam, your mother
craves a word with you.

727
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,673
- What is her mother ?
- Marry, bachelor,

728
00:49:16,754 --> 00:49:19,222
her mother is the lady of the house,
and a good lady...

729
00:49:19,314 --> 00:49:21,430
and a wise and virtuous.

730
00:49:21,514 --> 00:49:24,312
l nursed her daughter
that you talked withal.

731
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:27,352
l tell you, he that
can lay hold of her...

732
00:49:27,434 --> 00:49:29,265
shall have the chinks.

733
00:49:29,354 --> 00:49:31,265
- ls she a Capulet ?
- Mmm.

734
00:49:31,354 --> 00:49:34,949
Oh, dear account !
My life is my foe's debt.

735
00:49:35,034 --> 00:49:37,707
Away. Be gone.
The sport is at the best.

736
00:49:37,794 --> 00:49:40,752
Aye, so l fear.
The more is my unrest.

737
00:49:41,874 --> 00:49:44,991
Come hither, nurse.
What is yon gentleman ?

738
00:49:45,074 --> 00:49:47,349
The son and heir
of old Tiberio.

739
00:49:47,434 --> 00:49:49,948
Let it be night.

740
00:49:50,034 --> 00:49:53,822
- What's he that follows here
that would not dance ?
- l know not.

741
00:49:53,914 --> 00:49:55,711
Go ask his name.

742
00:49:57,074 --> 00:50:00,669
lf he be married,
my grave is like to be my wedding bed.

743
00:50:00,754 --> 00:50:03,712
No, do not go.

744
00:50:03,794 --> 00:50:05,625
l must. l must.

745
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:08,831
- The only son of your great enemy.
- Terrible.

746
00:50:08,914 --> 00:50:10,905
Simply... terrible !

747
00:50:17,074 --> 00:50:21,784
""But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks ?

748
00:50:21,874 --> 00:50:23,865
lt is the east,

749
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,468
and Juliet is the sun.

750
00:50:26,554 --> 00:50:30,911
Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon...

751
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:33,792
who is already sick
and pale with grief...

752
00:50:33,874 --> 00:50:38,231
that thou, her maid,
art far more fair than she.""

753
00:50:38,314 --> 00:50:40,987
- Oh, Will.
- Yes, some of it's speakable.

754
00:50:41,074 --> 00:50:43,713
""lt is my lady.
Oh, it is my love !

755
00:50:43,794 --> 00:50:46,513
Oh, that she knew she were !

756
00:50:46,594 --> 00:50:50,030
The brightness of her cheek
would shame those stars...

757
00:50:50,114 --> 00:50:52,309
as daylight doth a lamp.""

758
00:50:52,394 --> 00:50:55,386
Her eyes in heaven would
through the airy region...

759
00:50:55,474 --> 00:50:57,942
stream so bright...

760
00:50:58,034 --> 00:51:02,471
that birds would sing
and think it were not night.

761
00:51:02,554 --> 00:51:06,069
See how she leans her cheek
upon her hand.

762
00:51:06,154 --> 00:51:08,952
Oh, that l were a glove
upon that hand,

763
00:51:09,034 --> 00:51:11,184
that l might touch
that cheek.

764
00:51:11,274 --> 00:51:14,266
- Ay, me.
- ""Oh, Romeo.

765
00:51:14,354 --> 00:51:16,310
Romeo.

766
00:51:16,394 --> 00:51:18,862
Wherefore art thou, Romeo ?

767
00:51:18,954 --> 00:51:22,424
- Deny thy father and--""
- Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

768
00:51:22,514 --> 00:51:25,187
Or, if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love,

769
00:51:25,274 --> 00:51:27,913
and l'll no longer
be a Capulet.

770
00:51:27,994 --> 00:51:30,269
Shall l hear more,
or shall l speak at this ?

771
00:51:31,954 --> 00:51:34,593
""What man art thou that
thus bescreened in night...

772
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:37,268
so stumblest
on my counsel ?""

773
00:51:37,354 --> 00:51:40,426
By a name l know not
how to tell thee who l am.

774
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:44,985
My name, dear saint, is hateful to
myself, because it is an enemy to thee.

775
00:51:45,074 --> 00:51:48,384
Had l it written
l would tear the word.

776
00:51:48,474 --> 00:51:52,626
""The orchard walls are high
and hard to climb...

777
00:51:52,714 --> 00:51:55,751
and the place death,
considering who thou art,

778
00:51:55,834 --> 00:51:58,302
if any of my kinsmen
find thee here.

779
00:51:58,394 --> 00:52:01,306
lf they do see thee,
they will murder thee.""

780
00:52:01,394 --> 00:52:05,626
Alack, there lies more peril
in thine eye than 20 of their swords.

781
00:52:05,714 --> 00:52:09,946
Look thou but sweet,
and l am proof against their enmity.

782
00:52:10,034 --> 00:52:12,229
Would not for the world
they saw thee here.

783
00:52:12,314 --> 00:52:15,112
l have night's cloak
to hide me from their eyes.

784
00:52:15,194 --> 00:52:18,584
- And but thou love me
let them find me here.
- ""Good night.

785
00:52:18,674 --> 00:52:20,505
Good night,

786
00:52:20,594 --> 00:52:23,347
as sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart...

787
00:52:23,434 --> 00:52:25,709
as that within my breast.

788
00:52:25,794 --> 00:52:27,910
Oh, wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied ?""

789
00:52:27,994 --> 00:52:29,825
That's my line.

790
00:52:29,914 --> 00:52:31,870
Oh. lt is mine too.

791
00:52:31,954 --> 00:52:34,752
Oh, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ?

792
00:52:34,834 --> 00:52:37,553
What satifaction
canst thou have tonight ?

793
00:52:37,634 --> 00:52:40,432
The exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

794
00:52:40,514 --> 00:52:43,824
""My bounty is as boundless
as the sea.

795
00:52:43,914 --> 00:52:46,428
My love is deep.

796
00:52:46,514 --> 00:52:48,948
The more l give to thee,

797
00:52:49,034 --> 00:52:50,911
the more l have,

798
00:52:50,994 --> 00:52:52,905
for both are infinite.""

799
00:52:52,994 --> 00:52:55,349
Madam ?

800
00:52:55,434 --> 00:52:59,393
- l hear some noise within.
Dear love, adieu.
- Juliet !

801
00:52:59,474 --> 00:53:04,184
- ""Anon, good nurse.""
- Anon, good nurse.
Sweet Montague, be true.

802
00:53:04,274 --> 00:53:07,072
""Stay but a little.
l will come again.""

803
00:53:07,154 --> 00:53:09,952
Stay but a little.
l will come again.

804
00:53:10,034 --> 00:53:12,343
Oh, blessed, blessed night.

805
00:53:13,554 --> 00:53:15,863
""l am afeared...

806
00:53:15,954 --> 00:53:20,186
being in night,
all this is but a dream.

807
00:53:20,274 --> 00:53:22,583
Too flattering sweet...

808
00:53:22,674 --> 00:53:24,505
to be substantial.""

809
00:53:27,554 --> 00:53:30,352
To cease thy strife
and leave me to my grief.

810
00:53:30,434 --> 00:53:32,345
A thousand times,
good night.

811
00:53:32,434 --> 00:53:34,743
A thousand times
the worse to want thy light.

812
00:53:34,834 --> 00:53:38,304
l cannot move in this dress.
lt makes me look like a pig.

813
00:53:38,554 --> 00:53:41,432
l have no neck in this pig dress.

814
00:53:45,234 --> 00:53:48,783
- How is it ?
- lt's all right.

815
00:53:52,554 --> 00:53:55,193
Ned, l know, l know.

816
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:58,072
- lt's good.
- Oh ?

817
00:53:58,154 --> 00:54:00,793
The title won't do.

818
00:54:00,874 --> 00:54:02,546
Ah.

819
00:54:02,634 --> 00:54:05,944
Romeo and Juliet.
Just a suggestion.

820
00:54:07,114 --> 00:54:08,945
Thank you, Ned.

821
00:54:11,034 --> 00:54:15,983
- You are a gentleman.
- And you are
a Warwickshire shit-house.

822
00:54:16,074 --> 00:54:18,668
- What o'clock tomorrow
shall l send to thee ?
- By the hour of nine.

823
00:54:18,754 --> 00:54:20,870
l shall not fail.
'Tis 20 year till then.

824
00:54:20,954 --> 00:54:23,024
l have forgot
why l called thee back.

825
00:54:23,114 --> 00:54:25,708
- You mean no dog of any kind ?
- Shh ! Silence.

826
00:54:25,794 --> 00:54:28,354
The friar marries them in secret,

827
00:54:28,434 --> 00:54:31,232
then Ned gets into a fight
with one of the Capulets.

828
00:54:31,314 --> 00:54:35,148
Romeo tries to stop them and gets in
Ned's way. l mean, in Mercutio's way.

829
00:54:35,234 --> 00:54:38,271
So Tybalt kills Mercutio,
then Romeo kills Tybalt.

830
00:54:38,354 --> 00:54:40,549
Then the prince
banishes him from Verona.

831
00:54:40,634 --> 00:54:42,829
That must be when he goes on the voyage
and gets shipwrecked...

832
00:54:42,914 --> 00:54:44,745
on the island
of the pirate king.

833
00:54:44,834 --> 00:54:48,543
For God's sake,
cease your prattling and get out !

834
00:54:48,634 --> 00:54:50,989
Get out !

835
00:54:53,554 --> 00:54:55,385
A thousand apologies.

836
00:54:57,074 --> 00:54:59,713
Please.

837
00:54:59,794 --> 00:55:02,433
And with a silken thread
plucks it back again,

838
00:55:02,514 --> 00:55:04,664
so loving-jealous
of his liberty.

839
00:55:04,754 --> 00:55:09,589
- l would l were thy bird.
- Sweet, so would l; yet l should
kill thee with much cherishing.

840
00:55:10,634 --> 00:55:13,671
Good night.
Good night.

841
00:55:13,754 --> 00:55:18,225
Parting is such sweet sorrow, that l
shall say good night till it be morrow.

842
00:55:25,794 --> 00:55:28,467
Sunday.

843
00:55:28,554 --> 00:55:30,590
'Tis Sunday.

844
00:55:36,914 --> 00:55:39,747
l found something
in my sleep.

845
00:55:39,834 --> 00:55:44,191
The friar who married them
will take up their destinies.

846
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:48,108
- But it will end well for love.
- ln heaven, perhaps.

847
00:55:48,194 --> 00:55:50,992
lt is not a comedy
l'm writing now.

848
00:55:52,594 --> 00:55:55,586
A broad river
divides my lovers.

849
00:55:55,674 --> 00:55:58,711
Family, duty, fate.

850
00:56:01,034 --> 00:56:04,106
As unchangeable as nature.

851
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,025
Yes.

852
00:56:06,954 --> 00:56:09,912
This is not life, Will.

853
00:56:09,994 --> 00:56:12,906
lt is a stolen season.

854
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,825
- Be patient, my lord.
- Patient ?

855
00:56:14,914 --> 00:56:17,667
- Do you ask Her Majesty to be patient ?
- My Lord, l will go--

856
00:56:17,754 --> 00:56:20,712
Sunday. Greenwich !

857
00:56:24,074 --> 00:56:25,905
Now, pay attention, nursie.

858
00:56:25,994 --> 00:56:28,383
The queen--
Gloriana Regina,

859
00:56:28,474 --> 00:56:31,830
God's chosen vessel, the radiant one
who shines her light on us--

860
00:56:31,914 --> 00:56:34,906
is at Greenwich today and prepared
during the evening's festivities...

861
00:56:34,994 --> 00:56:38,031
to bestow her gracious favor
on my choice of wife.

862
00:56:38,114 --> 00:56:40,628
And if we're late for lunch,
the old boot will not forgive !

863
00:56:40,714 --> 00:56:44,707
So get you to my lady's chamber
and produce her with or without
her undergarments !

864
00:56:44,794 --> 00:56:47,024
You cannot !
Not for the queen herself !

865
00:56:47,114 --> 00:56:50,504
What will you have me do ?
Marry you instead ?

866
00:56:50,594 --> 00:56:52,949
To be the wife
of a poor player.

867
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:56,743
Can l wish that for Lady Viola
except in my dreams ?

868
00:56:56,834 --> 00:56:59,985
And yet l would if l were free to follow
my desire in the harsh light of day.

869
00:57:00,074 --> 00:57:02,793
You follow your desire
freely enough in the night.

870
00:57:02,874 --> 00:57:06,310
- So, if that is all, to Greenwich l go.
- Then l'll go with you.

871
00:57:06,394 --> 00:57:09,033
- You cannot. Wessex will kill you.
- l know how to fight.

872
00:57:09,114 --> 00:57:11,503
Stage fighting.

873
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,585
Oh, Will.

874
00:57:14,714 --> 00:57:17,023
As Thomas Kent,
my heart belongs to you,

875
00:57:17,114 --> 00:57:20,311
but as Viola,
the river divides us,

876
00:57:20,394 --> 00:57:24,307
and l must marry Wessex
a week from Saturday.

877
00:57:24,394 --> 00:57:27,192
l'll drag her down
by the queen's command !

878
00:57:29,994 --> 00:57:31,905
Good morning, my Lord.

879
00:57:31,994 --> 00:57:36,829
My lady. The tide waits for no man,
but l swear it would wait for you.

880
00:57:36,914 --> 00:57:40,304
Oh, here we come at last, my lord !

881
00:57:40,394 --> 00:57:42,749
Are you bringing
your laundrywoman ?

882
00:57:45,034 --> 00:57:47,628
Her chaperone,
my lady's country cousin.

883
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:51,104
My, but you be
a handsome gallant,

884
00:57:51,194 --> 00:57:53,424
just as she said.

885
00:57:53,514 --> 00:57:55,869
You may call me
Miss Wilhelmina.

886
00:57:55,954 --> 00:57:58,263
On a more fortuitous
occasion, perhaps.

887
00:57:58,354 --> 00:58:01,073
Oh, my Lord, you will not shake me off.

888
00:58:01,154 --> 00:58:05,591
Aye, she never needed me more.
l swear by your britches.

889
00:58:37,274 --> 00:58:39,105
- Now ?
- Now.

890
00:58:39,194 --> 00:58:42,072
The queen asks for you.
Answer well.

891
00:58:44,874 --> 00:58:47,069
- ls there a man ?
- A man, my lord ?

892
00:58:47,154 --> 00:58:50,590
There was a man, a poet.
A theater poet, l think.

893
00:58:50,674 --> 00:58:53,427
- Does he come to the house ?
- A theater poet ?

894
00:58:53,514 --> 00:58:56,870
An insolent penny-a-page rogue !
Marlowe, he said. Christopher Marlowe.

895
00:58:56,954 --> 00:58:59,149
- Has he been to the house ?
- Marlowe ?

896
00:58:59,234 --> 00:59:01,429
Oh, yes. He is the one.

897
00:59:01,514 --> 00:59:04,904
Lovely waistcoat.
Shame about the poetry.

898
00:59:04,994 --> 00:59:07,554
That dog !

899
00:59:22,674 --> 00:59:24,630
Your Majesty.

900
00:59:25,794 --> 00:59:27,989
Stand up straight, girl.

901
00:59:31,474 --> 00:59:33,305
l've seen you.

902
00:59:33,394 --> 00:59:36,943
You are the one who comes to all
the plays at Whitehall, at Richmond.

903
00:59:37,034 --> 00:59:39,502
Your Majesty.

904
00:59:39,594 --> 00:59:41,903
What do you love so much ?

905
00:59:41,994 --> 00:59:44,349
- Your Majesty--
- Speak up, girl !

906
00:59:44,434 --> 00:59:46,425
l know who l am.

907
00:59:46,514 --> 00:59:49,745
Do you love stories
of kings and queens ?

908
00:59:49,834 --> 00:59:51,665
Of feats of arms ?

909
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:54,348
Or is it courtly love ?

910
00:59:54,434 --> 00:59:56,311
l love theater.

911
00:59:56,394 --> 00:59:59,227
To have stories acted for me
by a company of fellows is indeed--

912
00:59:59,314 --> 01:00:02,784
They're not acted for you;
they are acted for me. And ?

913
01:00:04,234 --> 01:00:06,794
And l love poetry above all.

914
01:00:06,874 --> 01:00:08,705
Above Lord Wessex ?

915
01:00:08,794 --> 01:00:11,228
My lord,
when you cannot find your wife,

916
01:00:11,314 --> 01:00:13,623
you better look for her
at the playhouse.

917
01:00:15,874 --> 01:00:18,707
Playwrights teach us
nothing about love.

918
01:00:18,794 --> 01:00:21,991
They make it pretty; they make
it comical; or they make it lust.

919
01:00:22,074 --> 01:00:23,905
They cannot make it true.

920
01:00:23,994 --> 01:00:26,667
Oh, but they can.

921
01:00:29,034 --> 01:00:33,903
l mean, Your Majesty, they--
they do not, they have... not,

922
01:00:33,994 --> 01:00:36,189
but l believe
there is one who can.

923
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,148
My Lady Viola is young in the world.

924
01:00:40,234 --> 01:00:42,111
Your Majesty is wise in it.

925
01:00:42,194 --> 01:00:45,072
Nature and truth are the very enemies
of playacting. l'll wager my fortune.

926
01:00:45,154 --> 01:00:47,907
l thought you were here
because you had none.

927
01:00:53,554 --> 01:00:57,593
- Well, no one will take
your wager, it seems.
- Fifty pounds.

928
01:01:00,154 --> 01:01:01,951
Fifty pounds ?

929
01:01:03,434 --> 01:01:08,144
A very worthy sum
on a very worthy question.

930
01:01:08,234 --> 01:01:11,465
Can a play show us the very truth
and nature of love ?

931
01:01:13,234 --> 01:01:16,351
l bear witness to the wager...

932
01:01:16,434 --> 01:01:19,426
and will be the judge of it
as occasion arises.

933
01:01:22,034 --> 01:01:24,628
l have seen nothing
to settle it yet.

934
01:01:25,514 --> 01:01:27,982
Are there
no more fireworks ?

935
01:01:28,074 --> 01:01:31,828
They would be soothing after the
excitements of Lady Viola's audience.

936
01:01:31,914 --> 01:01:35,953
Have her, then,
but you are a lordly fool.

937
01:01:36,034 --> 01:01:39,822
She's been plucked since l saw her last,
and not by you.

938
01:01:39,914 --> 01:01:42,712
lt takes a woman to know it.

939
01:01:46,194 --> 01:01:48,025
Marlowe.

940
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:00,345
Burbage ?

941
01:02:00,434 --> 01:02:03,187
Huh ? Who's there ?

942
01:02:03,274 --> 01:02:05,834
Marlowe.

943
01:02:07,314 --> 01:02:09,270
You are playing
my Dr. Faustus this afternoon.

944
01:02:09,354 --> 01:02:11,470
Don't spend yourself
in sport.

945
01:02:11,554 --> 01:02:14,990
- What do you want, Kit ?
- My Massacre at Paris is complete.

946
01:02:15,074 --> 01:02:18,225
- What ? You have the last act ?
- lf you have the money.

947
01:02:18,314 --> 01:02:22,227
-Tomorrow.
-Then tomorrow you shall have the pages.

948
01:02:22,314 --> 01:02:24,509
Oh, will you desist, madam !

949
01:02:24,594 --> 01:02:27,392
- Oh !
- Twenty pounds on delivery.

950
01:02:27,434 --> 01:02:30,631
Now, what is money to men like us ?

951
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:36,224
Besides, if l need a play,
l have another waiting--
a comedy by Shakespeare.

952
01:02:36,314 --> 01:02:38,111
Oh, Romeo.

953
01:02:38,194 --> 01:02:41,311
- Gave it to Henslowe.
- Never !

954
01:02:41,394 --> 01:02:44,272
Well, l'm to Deptford.
l leave you my respects, Miss Rosaline.

955
01:02:44,314 --> 01:02:47,306
l gave Shakespeare
two sovereigns for Romeo.

956
01:02:47,394 --> 01:02:51,626
You did, but Ned Alleyn
and the Admiral's Men have
the playing of it at the Rose.

957
01:02:51,714 --> 01:02:53,591
Treachery !

958
01:02:54,874 --> 01:02:57,024
Traitor and thief !

959
01:02:59,834 --> 01:03:01,984
Oh, no.

960
01:03:02,034 --> 01:03:03,990
No !

961
01:03:21,034 --> 01:03:23,025
By my head,
here comes the Capulets.

962
01:03:23,114 --> 01:03:25,912
By my heel,
l care not.

963
01:03:26,994 --> 01:03:29,144
Follow me close.
l will speak with them.

964
01:03:29,234 --> 01:03:32,146
Gentlemen, good-den !
A word with one of you.

965
01:03:32,234 --> 01:03:34,384
Are you going
to do it like that ?

966
01:03:34,474 --> 01:03:36,590
Positions.

967
01:03:36,674 --> 01:03:40,792
- By my head, here comes the Capulets.
- By my heel, l care not.

968
01:03:40,874 --> 01:03:43,024
Follow me close.
l will speak to them.

969
01:03:43,114 --> 01:03:45,912
Gentlemen, good-den !
A word with one of you.

970
01:03:46,194 --> 01:03:49,266
And but one word with one of us ?

971
01:03:49,354 --> 01:03:52,027
Couple it with something;
make it a word and a blow.

972
01:03:52,074 --> 01:03:55,669
Where's that thieving hack that
can't keep his pen in his own ink pot ?

973
01:03:55,754 --> 01:03:57,790
What is this rabble ?

974
01:04:00,034 --> 01:04:02,707
Draw, if you be a man !

975
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:27,069
Wonderful.
Wonderful !

976
01:04:27,914 --> 01:04:31,224
And a dog.

977
01:04:32,714 --> 01:04:34,591
No !

978
01:04:34,674 --> 01:04:37,791
Have privy, players ! Please !

979
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,627
Oh ! Not with my props !

980
01:04:40,714 --> 01:04:42,067
Oh !

981
01:04:42,154 --> 01:04:44,952
- Will ! What--
- A writer's quarrel.

982
01:04:45,034 --> 01:04:47,343
Quite normal.

983
01:04:48,674 --> 01:04:50,710
Stay here.

984
01:05:01,794 --> 01:05:04,467
You are hurt.

985
01:05:16,754 --> 01:05:20,190
l dreamed last night
of a shipwreck.

986
01:05:20,274 --> 01:05:23,107
- You were cast ashore in a far country.
- Oh, not yet.

987
01:05:23,194 --> 01:05:25,025
Not yet.

988
01:05:25,114 --> 01:05:27,947
'Ey, we need that
for the balcony scene.

989
01:05:28,034 --> 01:05:30,264
My investment !
Lambert !

990
01:05:31,634 --> 01:05:33,784
Vengeance !

991
01:06:00,114 --> 01:06:02,105
A famous victory !

992
01:06:02,194 --> 01:06:06,107
Kegs and legs open,
and on the house !

993
01:06:06,194 --> 01:06:08,628
Oh, what happy hour.

994
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:11,831
- This is a tavern !
- lt is also a tavern.

995
01:06:11,914 --> 01:06:14,428
- l remember you. The poet !
- Yes, William the Conqueror.

996
01:06:16,434 --> 01:06:19,073
One at a time. One at a time.

997
01:06:19,154 --> 01:06:22,863
Oh, he's a pretty one. Tell me
your story while l tickle your fancy.

998
01:06:26,834 --> 01:06:30,429
- lt's a house of ill repute.
- lt is, Thomas, but of good reputation.

999
01:06:30,514 --> 01:06:33,267
Come.
There's no harm in a drink.

1000
01:06:33,354 --> 01:06:37,950
You are welcome to my best house.
Here's to the Admiral's Men.

1001
01:06:38,034 --> 01:06:39,672
- The Admiral's Men !
- The Admiral's Men !

1002
01:06:39,754 --> 01:06:41,585
The Admiral's Men !

1003
01:07:03,794 --> 01:07:06,911
Well, l--
l quite liked it.

1004
01:07:06,994 --> 01:07:09,303
Master Kent,

1005
01:07:09,394 --> 01:07:12,113
you have not yet
dipped your wick.

1006
01:07:14,114 --> 01:07:16,423
My ""wick"" ?

1007
01:07:16,514 --> 01:07:20,143
Mr. Fennyman,
because you love the theater,
you must have a part in my play.

1008
01:07:20,234 --> 01:07:24,989
l am writing an apothecary,
a small but vital role.

1009
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:28,032
My heavens.
l thank you.

1010
01:07:28,114 --> 01:07:30,309
What's the play about, then ?

1011
01:07:30,394 --> 01:07:32,464
Well, there's this nurse--

1012
01:07:37,714 --> 01:07:40,353
Silence, silence, silence !

1013
01:07:40,434 --> 01:07:42,709
Master Shakespeare...

1014
01:07:42,794 --> 01:07:46,912
has asked me to play
the part of the apothecary.

1015
01:07:49,034 --> 01:07:51,502
The apothecary ?

1016
01:07:51,594 --> 01:07:54,506
What is this story ?
Where is the shipwreck ?

1017
01:07:54,594 --> 01:07:56,664
How does the comedy end ?

1018
01:07:56,754 --> 01:08:00,793
- By God, l wish l knew.
- By God, if you do not, who does ?

1019
01:08:00,874 --> 01:08:04,344
Let us have pirates,
clowns and a happy ending,

1020
01:08:04,434 --> 01:08:07,551
or we shall send you
back to Stratford to your wife.

1021
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:26,591
Will ! Mr. Henslowe !
Gentlemen all !

1022
01:08:26,674 --> 01:08:30,303
A black day for us all !
There is news from a tavern in Deptford.

1023
01:08:30,394 --> 01:08:32,703
Marlowe is dead.

1024
01:08:36,474 --> 01:08:38,704
Stabbed.

1025
01:08:38,794 --> 01:08:42,992
Stabbed to death
in a tavern at Deptford.

1026
01:08:45,234 --> 01:08:47,668
What have l done ?

1027
01:08:47,754 --> 01:08:50,473
He was the first man among us.

1028
01:08:50,554 --> 01:08:53,114
A great light has gone out.

1029
01:09:08,234 --> 01:09:10,190
Forgive me.

1030
01:09:13,114 --> 01:09:15,264
God forgive me.

1031
01:09:40,754 --> 01:09:43,791
...Our Lord
Jesus Christ's sake.

1032
01:09:43,874 --> 01:09:46,183
One morning
in the month of May

1033
01:09:46,274 --> 01:09:49,186
From my cot l stray

1034
01:09:49,274 --> 01:09:51,834
Just at the dawning
of the day

1035
01:09:51,914 --> 01:09:54,382
l met with
a charming mai--

1036
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:59,829
You look sad, my lady.
Let me take you riding.

1037
01:09:59,914 --> 01:10:03,190
- lt's not my riding day, my lord.
- Bless me, l thought it was a horse.

1038
01:10:03,274 --> 01:10:05,788
l'm going to church.

1039
01:10:05,874 --> 01:10:09,423
Of course. l understand.
lt is to be expected.

1040
01:10:09,514 --> 01:10:12,790
Yes, it is to be expected...
on Sunday.

1041
01:10:12,874 --> 01:10:16,025
And on a day of mourning.

1042
01:10:16,114 --> 01:10:19,106
l never met the fellow
but once at your house.

1043
01:10:19,194 --> 01:10:21,105
Mourning ?

1044
01:10:22,794 --> 01:10:25,433
Who is dead, my lord ?

1045
01:10:25,514 --> 01:10:30,224
Oh ! Dear God, l did not think
it would be me to tell you.

1046
01:10:30,314 --> 01:10:34,751
Great loss to playwriting
and to dancing.

1047
01:10:35,834 --> 01:10:37,665
My lady.

1048
01:10:37,754 --> 01:10:41,269
- He is dead ?
- Killed last night in a tavern.

1049
01:10:42,834 --> 01:10:45,473
Come then.
We'll say a prayer for his soul.

1050
01:10:50,154 --> 01:10:58,186
Who can remember sorrow

1051
01:11:28,154 --> 01:11:30,304
Spare me, dear ghost.

1052
01:11:30,394 --> 01:11:33,033
Spare me, dear ghost.

1053
01:11:33,114 --> 01:11:35,833
Spare me, for the love of Christ.
Spare me !

1054
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:50,385
Will !

1055
01:11:51,754 --> 01:11:53,585
Oh, my love.

1056
01:11:53,674 --> 01:11:55,505
l thought you were dead.

1057
01:12:00,594 --> 01:12:03,188
lt is worse.

1058
01:12:03,274 --> 01:12:05,424
l've killed a man.

1059
01:12:09,434 --> 01:12:12,153
Marlowe's touch
was in my Titus Andronicus,

1060
01:12:12,234 --> 01:12:15,749
and my Henry Vl was a house built
on his foundations.

1061
01:12:16,834 --> 01:12:19,302
You never spoke
so well of him.

1062
01:12:19,394 --> 01:12:22,386
He was not dead before.

1063
01:12:22,474 --> 01:12:27,025
l would exchange all my plays to come
for all of his that will never come.

1064
01:12:28,314 --> 01:12:30,384
You lie.

1065
01:12:31,994 --> 01:12:35,987
You lie by this river
as you lied in my bed.

1066
01:12:36,074 --> 01:12:38,429
My love is no lie.

1067
01:12:39,554 --> 01:12:41,988
l have a wife, yes,

1068
01:12:42,074 --> 01:12:45,191
and l cannot marry the daughter
of Sir Robert De Lesseps.

1069
01:12:45,274 --> 01:12:48,823
You needed no wife come from Stratford
to tell you that,

1070
01:12:50,154 --> 01:12:53,112
and yet, you let me
come to your bed.

1071
01:12:53,194 --> 01:12:56,311
Calf-love.

1072
01:12:56,394 --> 01:13:00,626
l loved the writer and gave up
the prize for a sonnet.

1073
01:13:00,714 --> 01:13:03,353
l was the more deceived.

1074
01:13:03,434 --> 01:13:06,232
Yes, you were deceived,

1075
01:13:06,314 --> 01:13:09,545
for l did not know
how much l loved you.

1076
01:13:12,074 --> 01:13:15,032
l love you, Will,

1077
01:13:15,114 --> 01:13:17,105
beyond poetry.

1078
01:13:17,194 --> 01:13:19,583
Oh, my love.

1079
01:13:19,674 --> 01:13:23,553
- You ran from me before.
- When l thought you dead,
l did not care...

1080
01:13:23,634 --> 01:13:25,829
about all the plays
that would never come,

1081
01:13:25,914 --> 01:13:28,508
only that l would
never see your face.

1082
01:13:28,594 --> 01:13:31,745
l saw our end,
and it will come.

1083
01:13:31,834 --> 01:13:36,146
- You cannot marry Wessex.
- lf not you, why not Wessex ?

1084
01:13:36,234 --> 01:13:38,702
lf not Wessex, the queen
will know the cause,

1085
01:13:38,794 --> 01:13:43,265
- and there will be
no more Will Shakespeare.
- No. No.

1086
01:13:43,354 --> 01:13:47,666
But l will go to Wessex
as a widow from these vows,

1087
01:13:47,754 --> 01:13:50,552
as solemn as they
are unsanctified.

1088
01:13:52,074 --> 01:13:55,191
For killing Juliet's
kinsman Tybalt,

1089
01:13:55,274 --> 01:13:58,072
the one who killed
Romeo's friend Mercutio,

1090
01:13:58,154 --> 01:14:00,031
Romeo is banished.

1091
01:14:00,114 --> 01:14:02,582
- But the friar who married
Romeo and Juliet--
- ls that me ?

1092
01:14:02,674 --> 01:14:07,350
You, Edward. The friar who married
them gives Juliet a potion to drink.

1093
01:14:07,434 --> 01:14:11,029
lt is a secret potion.
lt makes us seeming dead.

1094
01:14:11,114 --> 01:14:13,947
She is placed in the tomb
of the Capulets.

1095
01:14:14,034 --> 01:14:16,673
She will awake to life and love
when Romeo comes to her side again.

1096
01:14:19,514 --> 01:14:22,665
l have not said all.

1097
01:14:22,754 --> 01:14:27,703
By maligned fate, the message
goes astray which would tell
Romeo of the friar's plan.

1098
01:14:27,794 --> 01:14:31,025
He hears only
that Juliet is dead.

1099
01:14:31,114 --> 01:14:33,992
And thus he goes
to the apothecary...

1100
01:14:34,074 --> 01:14:35,905
That's me.

1101
01:14:35,994 --> 01:14:38,144
and buys a deadly poison.

1102
01:14:38,234 --> 01:14:42,944
He enters the tomb to say farewell
to Juliet who lies there cold as death.

1103
01:14:43,034 --> 01:14:45,264
He drinks the poison.

1104
01:14:46,674 --> 01:14:48,824
He dies by her side,

1105
01:14:50,354 --> 01:14:53,664
and then she wakes
and sees him dead.

1106
01:14:53,754 --> 01:14:56,746
And so Juliet
takes his dagger...

1107
01:14:58,634 --> 01:15:01,512
and then kills herself.

1108
01:15:04,874 --> 01:15:07,468
Well, that will have them
rolling in the aisles.

1109
01:15:07,554 --> 01:15:10,307
Sad... and wonderful.

1110
01:15:11,434 --> 01:15:14,153
l have a blue velvet cap
that'll do well.

1111
01:15:14,234 --> 01:15:16,873
l've seen just such a cap
on an apothecary.

1112
01:15:16,954 --> 01:15:18,865
Just so.

1113
01:15:20,074 --> 01:15:23,032
Yes, it will serve.

1114
01:15:24,874 --> 01:15:27,069
But there's a scene missing.

1115
01:15:27,154 --> 01:15:29,907
Between marriage
and death ?

1116
01:15:36,074 --> 01:15:39,987
The play...
all written out for you.

1117
01:15:41,474 --> 01:15:43,988
l had the clerk
at Bridewell do it.

1118
01:15:44,074 --> 01:15:46,383
He has a good fist
for lettering.

1119
01:15:48,474 --> 01:15:50,305
There is a new scene.

1120
01:15:56,714 --> 01:16:01,026
- Will you read in for me ?
- ""Wilt thou be gone ?
lt's not yet near day.

1121
01:16:01,114 --> 01:16:03,753
lt was the nightingale,
and not the lark,

1122
01:16:03,834 --> 01:16:06,302
that pierced the fearful
hollow of thine ear.

1123
01:16:06,394 --> 01:16:09,352
Nightly she sings
on yon pomegranate tree.

1124
01:16:09,434 --> 01:16:12,153
Believe me, love,
it was the nightingale.""

1125
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:16,113
""lt was the lark,
the herald of the morn;

1126
01:16:16,194 --> 01:16:18,424
no nightingale.

1127
01:16:18,514 --> 01:16:21,312
Look, love,
what envious streaks...

1128
01:16:21,394 --> 01:16:25,353
do lace the severing clouds
in yonder east.

1129
01:16:25,434 --> 01:16:29,109
Night's candles
are burnt out,

1130
01:16:29,194 --> 01:16:31,503
and jocund day
stands tiptoe...

1131
01:16:31,594 --> 01:16:34,825
on the misty mountaintops.

1132
01:16:34,914 --> 01:16:39,192
l must be gone and live,
or stay and die.""

1133
01:16:40,874 --> 01:16:44,753
""Yon light is not daylight;
l know it, l.

1134
01:16:44,834 --> 01:16:47,667
lt is some meteor
that the sun exhales...

1135
01:16:47,754 --> 01:16:52,225
to be to thee this night
a torchbearer...

1136
01:16:52,314 --> 01:16:55,386
to light thee
on thy way to Mantua.

1137
01:16:56,994 --> 01:16:59,144
Therefore, stay yet.

1138
01:17:00,314 --> 01:17:02,623
Thou needst not
to be gone.""

1139
01:17:02,714 --> 01:17:04,864
""Let me be ta'en,

1140
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:07,912
let me be put to death;

1141
01:17:07,994 --> 01:17:12,146
l am content,
so thou wilt have it so.

1142
01:17:12,234 --> 01:17:14,702
l have more care
to stay...

1143
01:17:14,794 --> 01:17:17,069
than will to go.

1144
01:17:17,154 --> 01:17:19,429
Come, death, and welcome.

1145
01:17:19,514 --> 01:17:22,392
Juliet wills it so.""

1146
01:17:44,394 --> 01:17:47,352
You will go far, l fear.

1147
01:17:51,154 --> 01:17:53,588
l hope we work
together again.

1148
01:17:56,154 --> 01:17:59,032
""Such mortal drugs l have,
but Mantua's law...

1149
01:17:59,114 --> 01:18:03,232
is death, death to
any he that utters them.""

1150
01:18:03,314 --> 01:18:04,872
Then him. Then me.

1151
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:08,305
""Put-- Put this...

1152
01:18:08,394 --> 01:18:10,669
- in any liquid thing you will and--""
- Hah !

1153
01:18:10,754 --> 01:18:14,793
What is it ? What is it ?
What is it ?

1154
01:18:14,874 --> 01:18:18,708
How silver sweet sound
lovers' tongues by night.

1155
01:18:18,794 --> 01:18:20,625
- Like soft music--
- Shakespeare !

1156
01:18:37,354 --> 01:18:39,231
Upstart inky pup !

1157
01:18:40,314 --> 01:18:43,067
l'll show you your place,
which is in hell !

1158
01:18:47,314 --> 01:18:50,545
- You're on my ground now !
- By God, l'll fight the lot of you !

1159
01:18:50,634 --> 01:18:52,465
l am more than enough !

1160
01:18:59,794 --> 01:19:01,910
Move !

1161
01:20:19,994 --> 01:20:22,064
Absent friends.

1162
01:20:23,434 --> 01:20:26,267
This is the murderer
of Kit Marlowe !

1163
01:20:27,594 --> 01:20:29,425
Will ?

1164
01:20:29,514 --> 01:20:32,631
l rejoiced in his death
because l thought it was yours !
That is all l know of Marlowe !

1165
01:20:32,714 --> 01:20:36,150
Will ? Uh, it's true.

1166
01:20:36,234 --> 01:20:38,907
lt was a... tavern brawl.

1167
01:20:38,994 --> 01:20:43,749
Marlowe attacked
and got his own knife in the eye.

1168
01:20:43,834 --> 01:20:45,950
A quarrel about the bill.

1169
01:20:46,034 --> 01:20:49,151
The bill ?
Oh, vanity, vanity !

1170
01:20:49,234 --> 01:20:51,509
Not the billing,
the bill !

1171
01:20:55,074 --> 01:20:57,269
Oh, God.

1172
01:20:57,354 --> 01:20:59,743
- l am free of it.
- Where is she ?

1173
01:21:00,554 --> 01:21:02,704
Close it.

1174
01:21:02,794 --> 01:21:07,072
- My Lord Wessex.
- The Rose harbors the ass
that shits on my name !

1175
01:21:07,154 --> 01:21:09,270
Take it down
stone by stone.

1176
01:21:09,354 --> 01:21:12,903
l want it plowed into the ground
and sown with quicklime !

1177
01:21:12,994 --> 01:21:14,791
Mr. Tilney,
what is this ?

1178
01:21:14,874 --> 01:21:17,183
Sedition and indecency.

1179
01:21:17,274 --> 01:21:19,868
Master of the Revels, sir.
She's over here.

1180
01:21:19,954 --> 01:21:22,468
- Where, boy ?
- There.

1181
01:21:22,554 --> 01:21:24,624
l saw her bubbies.

1182
01:21:24,714 --> 01:21:28,912
So, a woman on the stage !

1183
01:21:28,994 --> 01:21:32,953
A woman !
l say this theater is closed !

1184
01:21:33,034 --> 01:21:34,433
Why, sir ?

1185
01:21:34,514 --> 01:21:38,473
For lewdness
and unshamedfacedness !

1186
01:21:38,554 --> 01:21:43,230
And for displaying a female
on the public stage !

1187
01:21:57,714 --> 01:21:59,670
Not him, her !

1188
01:22:02,874 --> 01:22:04,466
That's who l meant.

1189
01:22:07,034 --> 01:22:10,390
- He's a woman.
- This theater is closed.

1190
01:22:12,234 --> 01:22:15,510
Notice will be posted !

1191
01:22:15,594 --> 01:22:18,427
Ned, l swear, l knew nothing of this.

1192
01:22:18,514 --> 01:22:21,267
- Nobody knew.
- He did.

1193
01:22:21,354 --> 01:22:24,232
l saw him kissing her bubbies.

1194
01:22:26,594 --> 01:22:29,586
lt is over.

1195
01:22:29,674 --> 01:22:32,313
l'm sorry, Mr. Henslowe.

1196
01:22:46,154 --> 01:22:48,952
l wanted to be an actor.

1197
01:22:49,034 --> 01:22:51,389
l'm so sorry, Will.

1198
01:22:57,194 --> 01:23:00,152
You were... w-w--

1199
01:23:01,354 --> 01:23:03,504
w-wonderful.

1200
01:23:05,034 --> 01:23:07,184
Thank you.

1201
01:23:15,434 --> 01:23:19,507
""Let me put this in any
liquid thing you will and--""

1202
01:23:25,674 --> 01:23:28,142
Everything all right ?

1203
01:24:04,074 --> 01:24:07,146
l would've been good.

1204
01:24:07,234 --> 01:24:10,192
- l would've been great.
- So would l.

1205
01:24:10,274 --> 01:24:12,583
We both would.

1206
01:24:33,954 --> 01:24:36,309
Lambert, kill him.

1207
01:24:37,594 --> 01:24:39,744
That can wait.

1208
01:24:43,274 --> 01:24:48,268
The Master of the Revels despises us all
for vagrants and peddlers of bombast.

1209
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:51,870
But my father,
James Burbage,

1210
01:24:51,954 --> 01:24:56,232
had the first license to make a company
of players from Her Majesty,

1211
01:24:56,314 --> 01:25:00,830
and he drew from poets
the literature of the age.

1212
01:25:00,914 --> 01:25:04,270
We must show them
that we are men of parts.

1213
01:25:04,354 --> 01:25:06,265
Will Shakespeare has a play.

1214
01:25:07,714 --> 01:25:11,992
l have a theater.
The curtain is yours.

1215
01:25:43,594 --> 01:25:47,303
Will !
We'll be needing a Romeo.

1216
01:25:53,834 --> 01:25:55,870
Oranges !
Sweet oranges !

1217
01:26:22,514 --> 01:26:26,553
My ship is moored at bankside, bound for
Virginia on the afternoon tide.

1218
01:26:26,634 --> 01:26:28,625
Please do not weep, Lady De Lesseps.

1219
01:26:28,714 --> 01:26:30,545
You are gaining a colony.

1220
01:26:30,634 --> 01:26:33,353
And you, my lord,
are gaining 5,000 pounds...

1221
01:26:33,434 --> 01:26:35,823
by these drafts in my hand.

1222
01:26:35,914 --> 01:26:38,553
Would you oblige me
with 50 or so in gold...

1223
01:26:38,634 --> 01:26:41,592
just to settle my accounts
at the dockside ?

1224
01:26:42,834 --> 01:26:45,587
Ah, the bride !

1225
01:26:46,794 --> 01:26:49,592
Good morning, my lord.

1226
01:26:49,674 --> 01:26:53,462
l see you are... open for business,
so let's to church.

1227
01:26:58,474 --> 01:27:00,305
Be gone !

1228
01:27:00,394 --> 01:27:02,430
Hup, hup, hup !

1229
01:27:56,314 --> 01:27:58,145
Oh, my lord !

1230
01:27:58,234 --> 01:28:00,702
- Be good to her, my lord.
- l will.

1231
01:28:00,794 --> 01:28:02,785
Oh, God bless you !

1232
01:28:02,874 --> 01:28:05,593
Thank you. Uh, let go.
There's a good nurse.

1233
01:28:05,674 --> 01:28:07,551
The tide will not wait !

1234
01:28:07,634 --> 01:28:11,343
Farewell !
You'll all be welcome in Virginia !

1235
01:28:36,794 --> 01:28:39,354
Candy apples !

1236
01:28:39,434 --> 01:28:41,265
Candy apples !

1237
01:28:41,354 --> 01:28:44,744
Buy my apples !

1238
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:51,190
Thank you, sir.
Apples !

1239
01:28:58,394 --> 01:29:01,625
ls this, uh--
ls this all right ?

1240
01:29:01,714 --> 01:29:03,545
Yeah.

1241
01:29:18,234 --> 01:29:22,386
Licentiousness is made a show !
Vice is made a show !

1242
01:29:22,474 --> 01:29:26,831
Vanity and pride
likewise made a show !

1243
01:29:26,914 --> 01:29:31,669
This is the very business
of show !

1244
01:29:40,434 --> 01:29:44,791
T-T-- T-Two--

1245
01:29:44,874 --> 01:29:47,388
T-T-T-T-- T-- T--

1246
01:29:47,474 --> 01:29:50,989
T-- T-T-Two households--

1247
01:29:51,074 --> 01:29:53,907
- We're lost.
- No, it will turn out well.

1248
01:29:53,994 --> 01:29:57,304
- How will it ?
- l don't know. lt's a mystery.

1249
01:29:59,714 --> 01:30:03,104
T-T-- T-- T-T--

1250
01:30:03,194 --> 01:30:05,424
T-- T--

1251
01:30:54,634 --> 01:30:57,068
Two households,

1252
01:30:57,154 --> 01:31:00,146
both alike in dignity,

1253
01:31:00,234 --> 01:31:02,873
in fair Verona,

1254
01:31:02,954 --> 01:31:05,422
where we lay our scene.

1255
01:31:05,514 --> 01:31:08,426
From ancient grudge break
to new mutiny,

1256
01:31:08,514 --> 01:31:11,745
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

1257
01:31:11,834 --> 01:31:14,712
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

1258
01:31:14,794 --> 01:31:17,786
a pair of star-crossed lovers
take their life...

1259
01:31:17,874 --> 01:31:20,513
whose misadventured,
piteous overthrows...

1260
01:31:20,594 --> 01:31:23,904
doth with their death
bury their parents' strife.

1261
01:31:26,954 --> 01:31:29,912
...the which of you
with patient ears attend,

1262
01:31:29,994 --> 01:31:34,545
what here shall miss,
our toil shall strive to mend.

1263
01:31:40,634 --> 01:31:42,545
- Wonderful.
- Was it...

1264
01:31:43,634 --> 01:31:45,590
good ?

1265
01:31:48,234 --> 01:31:51,271
Gregory, on my word
we'll not carry coals.

1266
01:31:51,354 --> 01:31:54,266
No, for then
we should be colliers.

1267
01:31:54,354 --> 01:31:56,743
l mean, and we be
in choler we'll draw.

1268
01:31:56,834 --> 01:31:59,792
- Master Shakespeare.
- Luck be with you, Sam. Sam !

1269
01:31:59,874 --> 01:32:02,229
lt's not my fault.
l could do it yesterday.

1270
01:32:02,314 --> 01:32:05,351
Do me a speech.
Do me a line.

1271
01:32:05,434 --> 01:32:09,109
""Parting is such sweet sorrow.""

1272
01:32:09,194 --> 01:32:12,311
- Another little problem.
- What do we do now ?

1273
01:32:12,394 --> 01:32:16,148
- The show must-- You know.
- Go on !

1274
01:32:16,234 --> 01:32:19,510
Juliet does not come on for 20 pages.
lt will be all right.

1275
01:32:19,594 --> 01:32:21,903
- How will it ?
- l don't know. lt's a mystery.

1276
01:32:21,994 --> 01:32:24,189
- Fear me not.
- No, marry, l fear thee !

1277
01:32:26,514 --> 01:32:29,267
- Let them begin.
- l will frown as l pass by.

1278
01:32:29,354 --> 01:32:32,983
- Let them take it as they list !
- Nay, as they dare.

1279
01:32:33,074 --> 01:32:36,953
l will bite my thumb at them, which is
disgrace to them if they bear it.

1280
01:32:37,034 --> 01:32:39,832
Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir ?

1281
01:32:39,914 --> 01:32:43,065
- l do bite my thumb, sir.
- Excuse me. Thank you.

1282
01:32:43,154 --> 01:32:46,624
- Thank you. Excuse me.
- Do you bite your thumb at us, sir ?

1283
01:32:46,714 --> 01:32:48,545
- Can we talk ?
- Shh !

1284
01:32:48,634 --> 01:32:51,353
- We have no Juliet.
- No Juliet ?

1285
01:32:51,434 --> 01:32:54,426
- No Juliet ?
- lt'll be all right, madam.

1286
01:32:54,514 --> 01:32:57,472
- What happened to Sam ?
- Who are you ?
- Thomas Kent.

1287
01:32:57,554 --> 01:33:00,022
Do you know it ?

1288
01:33:00,114 --> 01:33:03,106
- l serve as good a man as you.
- Every word.

1289
01:33:06,794 --> 01:33:09,308
Hyah ! Yah !

1290
01:33:12,954 --> 01:33:15,832
l'll go along,
no such sight to be shown,

1291
01:33:15,914 --> 01:33:18,906
but to rejoice in splendor
of mine own.

1292
01:33:18,994 --> 01:33:21,189
Nurse !

1293
01:33:23,474 --> 01:33:26,591
Where's my daughter ?
Call her forth to me.

1294
01:33:26,674 --> 01:33:29,746
Now, by my maidenhead
at 12 years old,

1295
01:33:29,834 --> 01:33:31,665
l bade her come.

1296
01:33:31,754 --> 01:33:33,745
How now, who calls ?

1297
01:33:33,834 --> 01:33:36,473
What, ladybird !

1298
01:33:36,554 --> 01:33:38,226
God forbid !
Where's this girl ?

1299
01:33:38,314 --> 01:33:40,828
What, lamb !

1300
01:33:40,914 --> 01:33:43,030
What, ladybird !

1301
01:33:44,074 --> 01:33:46,383
What, Juliet !

1302
01:33:47,474 --> 01:33:50,705
How now, who calls ?

1303
01:33:53,554 --> 01:33:57,945
- We'll all be put in the Clink.
- See you in jail.

1304
01:34:00,954 --> 01:34:03,991
Your mother--
Your mother.

1305
01:34:04,074 --> 01:34:07,225
Madam, l am here. What is your will ?

1306
01:34:07,314 --> 01:34:09,270
This is the matter.

1307
01:34:09,354 --> 01:34:11,663
Nurse, give leave a while.
We must talk in secret.

1308
01:34:11,754 --> 01:34:16,305
Nurse, come back again. l have
remembered me; thou's hear our counsel.

1309
01:34:16,394 --> 01:34:19,591
Thou knowest my daughter's
of a pretty age.

1310
01:34:19,674 --> 01:34:23,030
- Faith, l know her age unto an hour.
- She's not 14.

1311
01:34:23,114 --> 01:34:28,393
Oh, l'll lay 14 of my teeth.
And yet my teen be it spoken,

1312
01:34:28,474 --> 01:34:31,113
l have but four--

1313
01:34:52,394 --> 01:34:54,350
Tell me, daughter Juliet,

1314
01:34:54,434 --> 01:34:58,825
how stands your dispositions
to be married ?

1315
01:34:58,914 --> 01:35:01,906
lt is an honor
that l dream not of.

1316
01:35:06,034 --> 01:35:08,787
Hold, Tybalt ! Good Mercutio !

1317
01:35:16,234 --> 01:35:19,306
l-- l'm sped.

1318
01:35:19,394 --> 01:35:22,067
Courage, man;
the hurt cannot be much.

1319
01:35:22,154 --> 01:35:24,429
Ask for me tomorrow,

1320
01:35:24,514 --> 01:35:27,233
you shall find me
a grave man.

1321
01:35:34,154 --> 01:35:37,271
Yes !

1322
01:35:42,314 --> 01:35:44,145
Yah!

1323
01:35:44,234 --> 01:35:46,668
""Such mortal drugs l have,

1324
01:35:46,754 --> 01:35:51,225
but Mantua's law is death
to any he that utters them.""

1325
01:35:51,314 --> 01:35:53,748
Then him. Then me.

1326
01:36:01,874 --> 01:36:03,865
Romeo, away, be gone !

1327
01:36:03,954 --> 01:36:08,186
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed !

1328
01:36:08,274 --> 01:36:12,347
The prince will doom thee death if thou
art taken. Hence, be gone, away !

1329
01:36:13,514 --> 01:36:15,744
Oh, l am Fortune's fool !

1330
01:36:15,834 --> 01:36:17,665
Why dost thou stay ?

1331
01:36:17,754 --> 01:36:19,665
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio ?

1332
01:36:19,754 --> 01:36:21,870
That murderer,
which way ran he ?

1333
01:36:21,954 --> 01:36:24,627
- There lies that Tybalt.
- Up, sir. Go with me.

1334
01:36:24,714 --> 01:36:26,670
l charge thee
in the Prince's name obey.

1335
01:36:26,754 --> 01:36:29,348
Where are the vile beginners
of this fray ?

1336
01:36:29,434 --> 01:36:31,584
""Oh, l am Fortune's fool.""

1337
01:36:34,274 --> 01:36:36,151
You are married ?

1338
01:36:39,634 --> 01:36:44,469
""lf you be married, my grave
is like to be my wedding bed.""

1339
01:36:59,594 --> 01:37:01,710
Art thou gone so,

1340
01:37:04,234 --> 01:37:06,270
love, lord,

1341
01:37:06,354 --> 01:37:08,470
aye, husband, friend ?

1342
01:37:08,554 --> 01:37:13,105
l must hear from thee
every day in the hour,

1343
01:37:13,194 --> 01:37:15,992
for in a minute
there are many days.

1344
01:37:16,074 --> 01:37:19,510
Oh, by this count
l shall be much in years ere again...

1345
01:37:19,594 --> 01:37:21,903
l behold my Romeo.

1346
01:37:21,994 --> 01:37:23,825
Farewell.

1347
01:37:25,274 --> 01:37:28,072
Oh, think'st thou
we shall ever meet again ?

1348
01:37:30,034 --> 01:37:32,946
Methinks l see thee,
now thou art so low,

1349
01:37:33,034 --> 01:37:36,344
as one dead
in the bottom of a tomb.

1350
01:37:36,434 --> 01:37:39,665
Either my eyesight fails,
or thou look'st pale.

1351
01:37:41,834 --> 01:37:43,950
Then trust me, love,

1352
01:37:44,034 --> 01:37:46,264
in my eyes, so do you.

1353
01:37:46,354 --> 01:37:49,949
Dry sorrow
drinks our blood.

1354
01:37:50,034 --> 01:37:51,865
Adieu.

1355
01:37:53,314 --> 01:37:55,828
Adieu.

1356
01:37:55,914 --> 01:37:58,553
Take thou this vial,
being then in bed,

1357
01:37:58,634 --> 01:38:01,592
and this distilling liquor
drink thou off.

1358
01:38:01,674 --> 01:38:05,462
No warmth, no breath,
shall testify thou livest.

1359
01:38:05,554 --> 01:38:08,387
And in this borrowed likeness
of shrunk death...

1360
01:38:08,474 --> 01:38:11,546
thou shalt continue
two and forty hours,

1361
01:38:11,634 --> 01:38:15,104
and then awake
as from a pleasant sleep.

1362
01:38:15,194 --> 01:38:17,185
What ho ! Apothecary !

1363
01:38:20,554 --> 01:38:24,024
Come hither, man.
l see that thou art poor.

1364
01:38:24,114 --> 01:38:26,912
Hold, there is 40 ducats.

1365
01:38:26,994 --> 01:38:30,589
- Let me have a dram of poison--
- Such mortal drugs l have,

1366
01:38:30,674 --> 01:38:34,553
but Mantua's law is death
to any he that utters them.

1367
01:38:34,634 --> 01:38:37,990
- Art thou so--
- My poverty, but not my will, consents.

1368
01:38:43,594 --> 01:38:46,392
l pay thy poverty
and not thy will.

1369
01:38:50,234 --> 01:38:52,304
Eyes, look your last.

1370
01:38:52,394 --> 01:38:55,033
Arms, take your last embrace.

1371
01:38:55,114 --> 01:38:57,344
And, lips,

1372
01:38:57,434 --> 01:39:00,744
oh, you,
the doors of breath,

1373
01:39:00,834 --> 01:39:03,143
seal with
a righteous kiss...

1374
01:39:05,034 --> 01:39:07,184
the dateless bargain...

1375
01:39:07,274 --> 01:39:09,424
to engrossing death.

1376
01:39:10,674 --> 01:39:13,393
Come, bitter conduct.

1377
01:39:13,474 --> 01:39:16,625
Come, unsavory guide.

1378
01:39:16,714 --> 01:39:20,263
Thou, desperate pilot,
now at once...

1379
01:39:20,354 --> 01:39:24,950
run on the dashing rocks
thy seasick weary bark.

1380
01:39:25,034 --> 01:39:27,343
Here's to my love !

1381
01:39:34,954 --> 01:39:37,991
Oh... true apothecary !

1382
01:39:41,834 --> 01:39:43,984
Thy drugs are quick.

1383
01:39:48,594 --> 01:39:51,062
Thus with a kiss...

1384
01:39:53,674 --> 01:39:55,665
l die.

1385
01:40:12,674 --> 01:40:14,665
Where is my lord ?

1386
01:40:16,354 --> 01:40:20,313
l do remember well where l should be,
and there l am. Where is my Romeo ?

1387
01:40:20,394 --> 01:40:21,622
Dead !

1388
01:40:34,474 --> 01:40:36,430
What's this ?

1389
01:40:36,514 --> 01:40:40,063
A cup, closed
in my true love's hand ?

1390
01:40:40,154 --> 01:40:42,543
Poison, l see,

1391
01:40:42,634 --> 01:40:45,228
hath been
his timeless end.

1392
01:40:50,674 --> 01:40:53,108
Oh, happy dagger,

1393
01:40:53,194 --> 01:40:55,071
this is thy sheath.

1394
01:40:57,914 --> 01:41:00,144
There rest...

1395
01:41:01,554 --> 01:41:03,704
and let me die.

1396
01:41:10,314 --> 01:41:13,750
A glooming peace
this morning with it brings;

1397
01:41:13,834 --> 01:41:18,066
the sun for sorrow
will not show his head.

1398
01:41:18,154 --> 01:41:22,944
Go hence, to have more talk
of these sad things.

1399
01:41:23,034 --> 01:41:25,184
Some shall be pardoned,

1400
01:41:25,274 --> 01:41:28,152
and some punished;

1401
01:41:28,234 --> 01:41:32,193
for never was a story
of more woe...

1402
01:41:32,274 --> 01:41:35,744
than this of Juliet...

1403
01:41:35,834 --> 01:41:37,984
and her Romeo.

1404
01:42:03,994 --> 01:42:06,747
Bravo !

1405
01:42:10,314 --> 01:42:12,225
- Yea ! Yea !
- Yea !

1406
01:42:56,714 --> 01:42:59,308
- Bravo !
- Yea ! Bravo !

1407
01:43:13,194 --> 01:43:17,426
- God save the queen !
- l arrest you in the name
of Queen Elizabeth !

1408
01:43:17,514 --> 01:43:21,348
Arrest who, Mr. Tilney ?

1409
01:43:21,434 --> 01:43:23,106
Everyone !

1410
01:43:23,194 --> 01:43:26,391
Admiral's Men,
the Chamberlain's Men...

1411
01:43:26,474 --> 01:43:30,626
and every one of you ne'er-do-wells
that stand in contempt...

1412
01:43:30,714 --> 01:43:33,945
of the authority vested
in me by Her Majesty !

1413
01:43:34,034 --> 01:43:37,913
Contempt ? You closed the Rose.
l have not opened it.

1414
01:43:37,994 --> 01:43:40,383
That woman is a woman !

1415
01:43:40,474 --> 01:43:42,465
What ?

1416
01:43:42,554 --> 01:43:45,626
A woman ?
You mean that goat ?

1417
01:43:45,714 --> 01:43:50,913
l'll see you all in Clink, in the name
of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth !

1418
01:43:50,994 --> 01:43:54,191
Mr. Tilney !

1419
01:43:59,194 --> 01:44:02,789
Have a care with my name.
You will wear it out.

1420
01:44:10,394 --> 01:44:12,988
The queen of England
does not attend...

1421
01:44:13,074 --> 01:44:15,030
exhibitions of public lewdness.

1422
01:44:15,114 --> 01:44:17,992
So something
is out of joint.

1423
01:44:19,834 --> 01:44:23,349
Come here, Master Kent.
Let me look at you.

1424
01:44:37,554 --> 01:44:40,352
Yes, the illusion
is remarkable.

1425
01:44:40,434 --> 01:44:43,028
And your error, Mr. Tilney,
is easily forgiven.

1426
01:44:44,314 --> 01:44:48,148
But l know something of
a woman in a man's profession.

1427
01:44:48,234 --> 01:44:51,067
Yes, by God,
l do know about that.

1428
01:44:52,754 --> 01:44:55,552
That is enough from you,
Master Kent.

1429
01:45:00,194 --> 01:45:02,344
lf only Lord Wessex
were here.

1430
01:45:02,434 --> 01:45:04,390
He is, ma'am.

1431
01:45:07,194 --> 01:45:10,266
Y-Your Majesty.

1432
01:45:11,474 --> 01:45:14,352
There was a wager
l remember...

1433
01:45:14,434 --> 01:45:19,064
as to whether a play could show
the very truth and nature of love.

1434
01:45:19,154 --> 01:45:21,622
l think you lost it today.

1435
01:45:26,114 --> 01:45:29,868
You are an eager boy.
Did you like the play ?

1436
01:45:29,954 --> 01:45:32,752
l liked it when she stabbed herself,
Your Majesty.

1437
01:45:39,154 --> 01:45:41,463
Master Shakespeare.

1438
01:45:43,954 --> 01:45:46,832
Next time you come to Greenwich,
come as yourself,

1439
01:45:46,914 --> 01:45:49,906
and we will speak
some more.

1440
01:46:06,674 --> 01:46:08,824
Your Majesty.

1441
01:46:10,194 --> 01:46:12,071
Why, Lord Wessex.

1442
01:46:12,154 --> 01:46:14,588
Lost your wife so soon ?

1443
01:46:14,674 --> 01:46:17,313
lndeed l am a bride short,

1444
01:46:17,394 --> 01:46:21,512
and my ship sails for the new world
on the evening tide.

1445
01:46:21,594 --> 01:46:24,062
How is this to end ?

1446
01:46:24,154 --> 01:46:26,793
As stories must
when love's denied--

1447
01:46:26,874 --> 01:46:29,388
with tears and a journey.

1448
01:46:29,434 --> 01:46:31,789
Those whom God
has joined in marriage...

1449
01:46:31,874 --> 01:46:35,184
not even l
can put asunder.

1450
01:46:35,274 --> 01:46:37,868
Master Kent.

1451
01:46:43,354 --> 01:46:47,188
Lord Wessex, as l foretold,
has lost his wife in the playhouse.

1452
01:46:49,074 --> 01:46:52,703
Go make your farewell
and send her out.

1453
01:46:52,794 --> 01:46:55,103
lt's time
to settle accounts.

1454
01:46:58,194 --> 01:47:01,072
- How much was that wager ?
- Fifty shillings.

1455
01:47:02,354 --> 01:47:04,788
Pounds.

1456
01:47:04,874 --> 01:47:09,152
Give it to Master Kent.
He will see it rightfully home.

1457
01:47:16,434 --> 01:47:20,222
Tell Master Shakespeare
something more cheerful next time...

1458
01:47:20,314 --> 01:47:23,033
for Twelfth Night.

1459
01:47:38,314 --> 01:47:40,111
Too late.

1460
01:47:40,194 --> 01:47:42,788
Too late.

1461
01:47:51,194 --> 01:47:53,150
My Lady Wessex.

1462
01:48:07,714 --> 01:48:10,626
A hired player
no longer.

1463
01:48:10,714 --> 01:48:13,228
Fifty pounds, Will,

1464
01:48:13,314 --> 01:48:15,703
for the poet of true love.

1465
01:48:16,794 --> 01:48:18,625
l'm done with theater.

1466
01:48:20,354 --> 01:48:22,788
The playhouse
is for dreamers.

1467
01:48:22,874 --> 01:48:25,263
Look what the dream
brought us.

1468
01:48:26,354 --> 01:48:28,868
lt was we ourselves
did that.

1469
01:48:30,194 --> 01:48:34,267
And for my life to come,
l would not have it otherwise.

1470
01:48:34,354 --> 01:48:38,347
l have hurt you,
and l'm sorry for it.

1471
01:48:38,434 --> 01:48:42,313
lf my hurt is to be
that you write no more,

1472
01:48:42,394 --> 01:48:44,703
then l shall be
the sorrier.

1473
01:48:50,034 --> 01:48:52,502
The queen commands
a comedy, Will,

1474
01:48:52,594 --> 01:48:54,471
for Twelfth Night.

1475
01:48:54,554 --> 01:48:57,512
A comedy.

1476
01:48:57,594 --> 01:48:59,505
What would my hero be ?

1477
01:48:59,594 --> 01:49:02,904
The saddest wretch in all the kingdom,
sick with love ?

1478
01:49:05,034 --> 01:49:08,390
lt's a beginning.

1479
01:49:08,474 --> 01:49:12,387
Let him be a duke,
and your heroine--

1480
01:49:12,474 --> 01:49:15,671
Sold in marriage
and halfway to America.

1481
01:49:17,434 --> 01:49:21,473
At sea, then.
A voyage to a new world.

1482
01:49:21,554 --> 01:49:24,307
A storm.
All are lost.

1483
01:49:24,394 --> 01:49:27,704
She lands... on a...

1484
01:49:27,794 --> 01:49:30,672
vast and empty shore.

1485
01:49:32,074 --> 01:49:34,030
She's brought to the duke--

1486
01:49:35,394 --> 01:49:38,306
- Orsino.
- Orsino ?

1487
01:49:39,394 --> 01:49:41,225
Good name.

1488
01:49:41,314 --> 01:49:45,466
But fearful of her virtue,
she comes to him dressed as a boy.

1489
01:49:45,554 --> 01:49:49,263
And thus is unable
to declare her love.

1490
01:49:51,394 --> 01:49:53,510
But all ends well.

1491
01:49:53,594 --> 01:49:55,710
How does it ?

1492
01:49:55,794 --> 01:49:57,830
l don't know.

1493
01:49:59,354 --> 01:50:02,027
lt's a mystery.

1494
01:50:07,994 --> 01:50:10,554
You will never age for me,

1495
01:50:10,634 --> 01:50:12,465
nor fade,

1496
01:50:12,554 --> 01:50:14,704
nor die.

1497
01:50:14,794 --> 01:50:17,183
Nor you for me.

1498
01:50:18,474 --> 01:50:20,669
Good-bye, my love.

1499
01:50:22,354 --> 01:50:24,629
A thousand times good-bye.

1500
01:50:28,954 --> 01:50:30,785
Write me well.

1501
01:51:02,194 --> 01:51:05,664
My story starts at sea,

1502
01:51:05,754 --> 01:51:08,871
a perilous voyage
to an unknown land.

1503
01:51:10,194 --> 01:51:13,152
A shipwreck.

1504
01:51:14,954 --> 01:51:18,583
The wild waters roar and heave.

1505
01:51:19,754 --> 01:51:22,871
The brave vessel
is dashed all to pieces,

1506
01:51:25,514 --> 01:51:29,223
and all the helpless souls
within her...

1507
01:51:29,314 --> 01:51:31,509
drowned.

1508
01:51:34,074 --> 01:51:37,225
All save one:

1509
01:51:37,314 --> 01:51:39,384
a lady...

1510
01:51:40,714 --> 01:51:44,787
whose soul is greater
than the ocean,

1511
01:51:44,874 --> 01:51:48,947
and her spirit,
stronger than the sea's embrace.

1512
01:51:51,194 --> 01:51:54,186
Not for her a watery end,

1513
01:51:55,674 --> 01:51:59,587
but a new life beginning
on a stranger shore.

1514
01:52:03,554 --> 01:52:05,988
lt will be a love story,

1515
01:52:09,954 --> 01:52:13,947
for she will be my heroine
for all time.

1516
01:52:16,674 --> 01:52:20,064
And her name will be Viola.
