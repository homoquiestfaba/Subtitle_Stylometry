This Project Together?

Can't, Man.
I'm Doing It With Jake.

53
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,732
Forget It, Dude.
Last Time We Worked Together,

54
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:19,800
I Did All The Work,
And You Sat On Your Butt.

Of Your Talent.

So Difficult

Finding The Right Person
To Partner With
On These Projects.

00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:07,048
I Don't Know About You,
But I Just Hate Doing
All The Work.

72
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:09,884
That Happens
To You, Too?

73
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,819
People Who Use People
Are Totally Lame.

74
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,322
Totally.

75
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,695
So, Um...Maybe You And I
Should Team Up.

76
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,563
Or Is That
Totally Lame, Too?

77
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,800
No! That's Totally Cool.

78
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,034
Cool.

79
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,904
Awesome.
So, Why Don't I Come
By Your House After School

80
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:34,007
And We Can Get Started
On Our Project Together?

85
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,923

I Want You To Meet.

To Meet You.

( Cell Phone Ringing )

95
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,945
Oh. Hmm.

96
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,913
Gotta Take This.

97
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,748
Don't Go Away.

98
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,018
What Up?

99
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:20,553
Where Are You?

100
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:22,456
You Ducked Out Of
School So Fast.

101
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,758
Is There A Sale
Going On That We
Should Know About?

102
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,161
Heh. I'm At
Jake Logan's House.

103

She's At
Jake Logan's House.

104
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,065
There's A Sale At
Jake Logan's House?

105
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,932
No, I'm Using
This Nerd

106
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:35,870
To Get Myself
A Nice Grade
In Science.

107
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,838
Oh. Why Didn't I
Think Of That?

108
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,607
'Cause I'm Smarter
Than You.

109
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,409
And I Know I Need
To Get Someone

110
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:43,844
Even Smarter
Than Me.

111
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,546
Jake: Julianne,
Check This Out.

112
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,081
You Can Harness Energy
From Cow Poop.

113
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,616
Julianne:
Fascinating!

114
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,084
I Have To Go
Look At Cow Poop.

115
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,118

Grab A Chair.

121
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,534
So, The Cow Poop
Is Kind Of Smelly.

122
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,803
I Was Thinking
Instead We Could
Make A Wind Turbine

123
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,837
That Ignites
An Electrical Spark.

124
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,909
Murray, Come On, That's
Julianne's Chair.

125
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:18,012
Isn't My Dog Smart?

126
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:18,012
Frighteningly--

127
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,614
Like Some Trained Dog
They Use In The Movies.

128
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,750
( Groans )

129
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:26,153
Now, Scram, Einstein.

( Groans )

131
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:29,156
We Have A Project To Do.

134
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:34,195
Murray, Cheer Up.

135
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,096
You Look Like You Lost
Your Best Friend.

136
00:06:36,128 --> 00:06:38,532
Jake?

137
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,201
Hey, Mom.
What's Up?

138
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,070
Guess What Just Came,
Special Delivery?

139
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:45,039
Serious?

140
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:51,911
N.A.S.A.

141
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,947
I Am So Proud Of You.

142
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:56,517
Oh!

143
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,084
What'd I Miss?

144
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:00,620
I Got A Certificate
From N.A.S.A.

145
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:02,022
Pretty Cool, Huh?

146
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,824
Oh. Heh. Like
A Gift Certificate?

147
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,226
How Much?

148
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,961
Hi. I'm Julianne.

149
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:10,231
It's Nice To Meet You,
Julianne.

150
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,566
What Are You
Painting?

151
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,901
Oh. Ha Ha! The Den.

152
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,102
I Love That Shade
Of Pink.

153
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:17,705
Matches My Lip Gloss.

154
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:20,241
Don't You Think So,
Jakey?

155
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,675
Jakey?

156
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,544
Mom, Don't You Have

157
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,678
A Second Coat
To Paint Or Something?

158
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,848
Right. Yes,
A Second Coat.

159
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,750
Oh, Hey, Why Is Murray
In The Hall?

160
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:34,087
He's Been Acting Up.
I Don't Know What's Up
With Him.

161
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,123
Nothing A Breath Mint
Wouldn't Cure.

162
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,866
( Kiss )

163
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,868
( Growling )

164
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,637
You Want The Ball, Murray?
You Want The Ball?

165
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,272
Okay, Go Get It, Buddy!

166
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,272
( Barks )

167
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:03,851
That's Beyonce--
Murray's Girlfriend.

168
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:07,254
Hey! Hey, No Sniffing!
Be A Gentleman!

169
00:08:10,222 --> 00:08:13,860
How Much Longer
Do We Have To Be
In This Smelly Park?

170
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:16,864
I Hope This Mud
Doesn't Ruin My Shoes.

171
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,998
This<I> Is Mud,
Isn't It?

172
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:22,702
Julianne,
Dogs Need Exercise.

173
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,605
So, How's
The Research Coming?

174
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,073
Any Good Articles
We Can Use?

175
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:30,143
Oh, Tons.
Espadrilles Are Back.

176
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,714
You Want To Go Toss
The Ball For Murray?

177
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:36,883
Murray!
Come Here, Buddy.
Come On, Murray.

178
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:42,755
Uhh! This Dress
Is 50% Silk!

179
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,058
Now It's
10% Slime!

180
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,126
You Want To
Play, Doggy?

182
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,796
Let's Play.

183
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,104
That's A Toss?

184
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,677
Hi There.

185
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,346
Aw, Hey, Cutie.

186
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,682
Is This Yours?
What's Your Name?

187
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,884
Murray.

188
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:15,688
Murray. Yes,
You're So Cute.

189
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,826
Whoever Your Owner Is,
I'm Totally Jealous.

190
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:22,095
( Laughs ) Aww.

191
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:25,032
So, Jakey,
I Was Thinking--

192
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,934
Maybe It'd
Be Better For You

193
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,335
To Finish The Project
Without Me.

194
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:32,339
Wait. So, You Want Me
To Do All The Work?

195
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,942
No! Heh!
No, I Want To Help.

196
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,143
It's Just That--

197
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,879
I'm So Embarrassed
To Even Say This
To You, Jakey--

198
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,783
But I Can't Think
Straight When I'm
Around You.

199
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,719
Really?

200
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:50,224
Uh-Huh. You're
Just So Darn Cute.

201
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,260
But...I Bet
You Already Have
A Girlfriend.

202
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:56,162
Right? Your Own
Little Poodle.

203
00:09:56,195 --> 00:10:00,233
Actually, Uh,
At The Moment,
I Don't Have A Poodle.

204
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,102
I Mean Girlfriend.

205
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,003
Well...

206
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,839

Your Lucky Day.

208
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:11,277
Whoa, Julianne--
Check Out Murray.

209
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,984

Is That My Scarf?

250

No. No, No, No.
This Is A Guy's Scarf.

251

Been On Scarves?

What's Wrong With It?

For "Lose The Scarf."

359
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,348
( Barks )

360
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,249
Come Here, Buddy.

361
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,269
I've Looked
All Over The House.

362
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,637
I Don't Think That
Murray's Hiding.

363
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:26,639
I Think He Ran Away.

364
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:28,340
Jake, I Know
You're Mad At Him,

365
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:30,377
But He's Still
Your Best Friend.

366
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,879
Mom, We<I> Were
Best Friends.

367
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,749
Now We're Enemies.

368
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,217
Frenemies.

369
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,186
Precisely.

370
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,290
Look, If You Don't Mind,
I've Got A Lot Of
Work To Do.

371
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,725
I Need To Finish
This Project.

372
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,930
Where's Julianne?
I Thought You Two
Were Partners.

373
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,904
You're Doing
This Whole Project
By Yourself, Aren't You?

374
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,506
Mom, That's Just
What A Guy Does
For His Girlfriend.

375
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,242
Really?

376
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,179
You Think Murray
Will Come Back?

377
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:09,916
I Don't Know.
I Guess It Depends

378
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,385
On What Guys Do
For Their Dogs.

379
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,295
Jake Logan, President
Of The Science Club.

380
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,830
Found Him.

381
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,302
What, You Think
I Marked This Page

382
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,239
'Cause I Like Jake?

383
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:34,674
Nuh-Uh.

384
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,976
Fine, I Sort Of
Have A Crush On Him.

385
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,512
But He's Never Gonna
Feel The Same Way,
So Who Cares?

386
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,617
Plus, He Already
Has A Girlfriend--

387
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,951
Julianne.

388
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,951
( Whines )

389
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,686
( Laughs )

390
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,756
What's Important
Is That We Get You Home.

391
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:54,393
Murray, Give That Back!

392
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:57,664
Don't You Want
To Get Found?

393
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,466
Guess Not.

394
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:09,275
I'm Gonna Be Late.

395
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:11,610
Murray,
Why Didn't You Wake...

396
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:13,814
Me?

397
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,858
( School Bell Rings )

398
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,496
So, Leonard,
How's My Report

399
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,064
On<I> Scarlet's
Sweater?

400
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,066
It's Called<I>
The Scarlet Letter.

401
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:34,934
I Like Mine Better.

402
00:20:34,966 --> 00:20:36,869
It's Really
A Thought-Provoking Book.

403
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,938
I Argue That Hester Prynne
Is Actually--

404
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:43,410
Whatevs, Leonard.
You Are So The Best
Boyfriend Ever.

405
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,616
I Thought Jake
Was Her Boyfriend.

406
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:10,870
Is It Ready?

407
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,908
Yes! Ha!

408
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,577
( Squeals )

409
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:23,550
Two Boyfriends, Plus Jake?
That' Disgusting.

410
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,685
And Slightly Impressive.

411
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,695
( Whimpers )

412
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,665
( Barks )

413
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,073
Yes, You Did.

414
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,073
No, I Didn't.

415
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:50,476
Hey, Isn't That
Murray?

416
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,551
Missing Something?

417
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:00,920
Where'd You Get That?

418
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:02,622
It Was Taped
To Your Locker.

419
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,923
Who's Savannah?

420
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,923
Why Does She
Have Murray?

421
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:05,425
He, Uh--

422
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,060
He Sort Of Got Loose.

423
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:12,065
Look, The Truth Is,
He Ran Away...From Me.

424
00:22:12,098 --> 00:22:14,768
But Murray's
Your Best Bud.
He Wouldn't Do That.

425
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:16,703
I Was Spending All My Time
With Julianne

426
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,905
And Ignoring Him,
So He Started Acting Up.

427
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:21,040
I Feel You, Murray.

428
00:22:21,072 --> 00:22:23,976
Then He Tried To Flush
My N.A.S.A. Award
Down The Toilet.

429
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,779
I Was Pretty Rough On Him.

430
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,880
Dude, Murray Would
Never Trash Something

431
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:29,616
If He Knew
It Was Important.

432
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,151
That's What My Mom Said.

433
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,421
Wait A Minute.

434
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,525
Wait A Minute, That's It.

435
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:40,493
That's Why I Smelled
Perfume On My Award.

436
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,195
Julianne Must've
Sprayed Some On,

437
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,062
Knowing That When
Murray Smelled It,

438
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,665
He'd Think It Was Another
Love Letter From Her

439
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,932
And Trash It.

440
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,635
Dude, I Hate
To Tell You...

441
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,703
But Your Dog Was Framed
By Your Girlfriend.

442
00:22:50,735 --> 00:22:52,805
Your Dog Was Dogged.

443
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:55,073
I Cannot Believe
She Did This To Me.

444
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,844
And I Was Dissing
You Two For Her.

445
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:01,080
The Next Time I See Her Face,
She'd Better Watch Out.

446
00:23:01,112 --> 00:23:02,748
Hey, Jakey.

447
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:05,018
Hey, Julianne.

448
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,887
As Soon As Jake
Comes Back To Earth,

449
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,621
He's So
Blowing You Off.

450
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:11,624
Yeah. Revenge
Of The Mutt.

451
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:14,560
Murray?
I Love Murray.

452
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,228
I'm Heartbroken
That He Ran Away

453
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:18,063
And Is Never Coming Back.

454
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:19,800
Hopefully.

455
00:23:22,031 --> 00:23:22,569
Hopefully?

456
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:27,941
You Used Me, Julianne.

457
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:29,908
And I Wasn't Smart Enough
To Realize It,

458
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:31,611
But My Dog Did.

459
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:33,480
And That's Why You Wanted
To Get Rid Of Him.

460
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,548
Come On, Guys,
We're Out Of Here.

461
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,082
After You, Jakey.

462
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:40,086
I Mean Jake.

463
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,688
( School Bell Rings )

464
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,226
Jake! Me Using You?

465
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,231
That's The Most
Ridiculous Thing
I've Ever Heard.

466
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,666
You Did Finish Our
Project, Though, Right?

467
00:23:56,535 --> 00:24:00,606
Jakey! You Are
The Best Boyfriend Ever!

468
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:01,974
Yeah, The Best
Out Of Three.

469
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:06,945
Heh. Norm. Leonard.

470
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:09,114
I Could Totally Explain
This Whole Thing.

471
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:11,149
Well...

472
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,987
I Can't When You're
Staring At Me Like
I Did Something Wrong.

473
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,655
Duh.

474
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:23,295
You Think You're
So Clever, Don't You--

475
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:25,164
Punking Me Like That?

476
00:24:25,196 --> 00:24:27,900
Yeah, Actually,
I Thought I Did
A Pretty Good Job.

477
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:29,836
Well, This Little
Stunt Of Yours

478
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,838
May Have Cost Me
Some As,

479
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:36,141
But If You Think
It's Gonna Make You
Any More Popular, Wrong!

480
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:39,846
You Will Always
Be Weird.

481
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,113
Well, I Think
Savannah's Awesome.

482
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,849
Yeah, Like He Said.

483
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,283
Seriously?

484
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,118
Yeah.

485
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,822
Julianne...

486
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,257
This Science Project
Is Done.

487
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,026
So Are We.

488
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:54,827
We're Done...

489
00:24:54,859 --> 00:24:56,963
Just As Soon As You
Hand Me That Project...

490
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,598
Partner.

491
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,566
Jake, No! She
Doesn't Deserve It.

492
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:04,204
I'm Waiting...Jakey.

493
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,573
You Think I Care
About This?

494
00:25:07,607 --> 00:25:10,976
I Can Always Get
Another "A".

495
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,246
And Maybe One Day
I'll Get Another
Girlfriend, But...

496
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,949
After The Way
I Treated Murray,

497
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:18,018
I May Never Get
My Best Friend Back.

498
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:21,620
And He's Worth
More Than Anything.

499
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:22,989
( Scoffs )
Whatevs.

500
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,724

501
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,724
Aah!

502
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:27,126
Murray!

503
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,361
The Project!

504
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:31,097
Whoa! Ha Ha!

505
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,800
Oh, No, He's Gonna--

506
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:37,003
( Laughter )

507
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,272
Ooh!

508
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,272
Bad Dog!

509
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:40,739
( Growling )

510
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,341
Did I Say, "Bad Dog"?

511
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,176
I Meant,
"Good Doggy!"

512
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,080
( Barks )

513
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,080
Good--Good Doggy.

514
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,780
Yeah.

515
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:50,949
( Barks )

516
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:50,949
Aah!

517
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:52,385
( Barks )

518
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,286
Aah!

519
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,286
Aah!

520
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,388
( Barks )

521
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:58,625
Murray.

522
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,126
Man, Am I Glad
To See You.

523
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,261
And I Promise,
If You Come Home
With Me,

524
00:26:02,293 --> 00:26:05,697
It's Just
You And Me, Buddy--
No Girls...

525
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,267
Ever Again.

526
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:13,339
So...Guess I'll
Just Be Going.

527
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,741
Maybe I'll
Catch You Guys
At The Dog Park.

528
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:18,878
I'll Miss You,
Murray.

529
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,212
Come Visit Me,
Okay?

530
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,314
Definitely.

531
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,022
( Growling )

532
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,288
You Hate The Scarf,
Too, Huh?

533
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:32,024
( Laughs )

00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,728
Halley: I'm So Glad
Jake Didn't Let Julianne

535
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,864
Come Between Him
And His Pooch.

536

Avalon: What Do They Say?
A Dog's A Boy's Best Friend?

537
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:43,869
Halley And I Put Jake's Story
On Our Webazine <I> Geekly Chic

538
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:46,939
Because It Almost Turned Us
Into Frenemies Once.

539
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:48,941
I Was At Home,
Finishing Up An Email,

540
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:51,011
When It All Started.

541
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:58,251
Halley Brandon,
You Are An Awesome Writer.

542
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,253
Too Bad The Rest Of The World
Hasn't Gotten The Memo.

543
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:06,192
( Sighs )

544
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:18,137
( Dialing )

545
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,339
<I>Hello?

546
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,339
It's Finished.

547
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:22,774
It's Perfect.
And It's Sent.

548
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,111
Aah!

549
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,111
Aah!

550
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:28,047
I'm So Excited.
I Am So Excited.

551
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,282
When Burns Publications
Opens That Link

552
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,251
To Our Webazine<I>
Geekly Chic,

553
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:34,753
They Are So Going
To Want To Be
In Business With Us.

554
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:37,457
I Know. I Mean,
Between Your Fashion Tips

555
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,193
And My Articles,
How Could They Not?

556
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,861
Speaking Of Fashion Tips,
Shade Up, Girl.

557
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:49,969
Okay, So, Am I Working
This Referee Look?

558
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,205
What Do You Think?

559
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,407
Touchdown!

560
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,407
Thank You.

561
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,141
Oh, And Score With
That Belt, Too.

562
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,909
Kendall's?

563
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,909
Yep.

564
00:27:57,943 --> 00:27:59,412
Like He Ever Wears It.

565
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:01,880
My Brother's Pants
Fall Off His Butt So Low,

566
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:03,950
I'm Forced To Look
At His Boxer Shorts

567
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:05,484
With Smiley Faces
On Them.

568
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,153
How Is That
Possibly Attractive?

569
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,254
It's Not. Although...

570
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:11,791
It Does Make It
Way Easier For You
To Give Him A Wedgie.

571
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,959
( Laughs )

572
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,959
( Call Waiting Beeps )

573
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:17,195
Okay, We Gotta Go.
We're Gonna Be Late.
Shade Down!

574
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:19,931
Were You And Avalon
Just Talking About Me?

575
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:21,367
Yeah, We Were
Just Discussing

576
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,869
How You Seriously
Rock Those Pants.

577
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,838
Right.
What Do You Want?

578
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,873
Could You Drive Us
To School?

579
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,873
No.

580
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:29,309
Hey, Is That My Belt?

581
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,079
I'll Pay
For Belt Rental.

582
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,281
Rent-A-Belt.
I Like It.

583
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,349
But I'm Not Waiting.

584
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,418
Wait!

585
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:42,288
Wait!

586
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,423
I'm In Really,
Really Tall Heels!

587
00:28:44,455 --> 00:28:47,025
Come On!

588
00:28:44,455 --> 00:28:47,025
I'm Trying!
I'm In Tall Heels!

589
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:56,134
Female G.P.S. Voice:<I>
Turn Right On Addison.

590
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:59,237
Baby, Could You Repeat
That Last Direction
For Me...Slowly?

591
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:01,307
<I> Turn Right On Addison.

592
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:04,877
Uh, Kendall,
Why Do You Need
A G.P.S. System?

593
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,879
You're A Senior.
You Know How To
Get To School.

594
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,882
He's In Love
With Her Voice.

595
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,184
I'm Not In Love
With Her Voice.

596
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:12,951
"You're Not My Type,
Kendall.

597
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:14,587
"I Hate Smiley-Face
Underwear.

598
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:17,156
Recalculating.
Recalculating."

599
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:19,425
( Both Laugh )

600
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:19,425
You Guys Can Laugh
All You Want.

601
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:22,195
But This G.P.S. Can Be
Programmed To Speak In
12 Different Languages.

602
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:23,929
It Can Even Give
Directions In Urdu.

603
00:29:23,963 --> 00:29:26,464
"Urdu?
I Hardly Know You."

604
00:29:26,497 --> 00:29:28,200
( Both Laugh )

605
00:29:35,506 --> 00:29:37,943
So, Anything From

Oh, Wait. We Didn't
Have An Issue In 1982.

Yeah. Pretty
Professional, Huh?

627
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:30,061
You Know What?
You Could Actually Put
One Of These Cards

628
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:32,064
On Every Locker
In The Whole School.

629
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:34,433
It Doesn't Matter,
Because Nobody Will Care

630
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:36,301
Unless I Tell Them To.

631
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,503
I'm Sorry, I Didn't
Hear What You Said.

632
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:39,037
Could You Repeat That?

633

Why, Thank You.
But, Halley,

00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:21,680
You'll Have To Learn
How To Stand Up To
People Like That.

651
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:24,349
Uh, Heh--
No, Thank You.

So, If You Don't Mind,
I'll Stick To

Maybe It's...The Dot.

672
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:14,333

Right. Okay.

00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,671
We Knew That.

00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:49,481
You Two Are A Lot Younger
Than I Thought You'd Be.

Is That A Problem?
'Cause We're Very
Mature For Our Age.

753
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:54,620
Yes, People Think
We Are, Like, 30.

754
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,222
I Want Young.

755
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,823
And That's When
We Tell Them,

756
00:35:57,856 --> 00:36:00,526
"Hello, People!
We're Only 14"

757
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:02,528
Right, Av?

758
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:02,528
Totally.

759
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,896

A Young Voice,

A Unique Voice.

762
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,270
And I Think<I> Geekly Chic
Is That Voice.

763
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:15,641
It Is? I Mean, Uh,
Of Course It Is.

764
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,942
Wait, You Really
Liked Our Webazine?

765
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:20,878
Loved It. Which Is Why
I Want To Use It

766
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:23,482
To Launch Our Brand-New
Website, Our New Magazine,

767
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,384
And Our New Fabulous
Clothing Line.

Are You Kidding?

770
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:33,658
Do I Look Like A Person
With A Sense Of Humor?

771
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,527
No, Not Really.

778
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:50,508
Miss St. Claire,
You Have No Idea

779
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:53,579
How Long Halley And I
Have Been Dreaming
About This Day.

780
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,981
Wait A Minute.
"Halley And<I> I"?

781
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:59,852
I Called This Meeting
With Halley Brandon,
The Editor-In-Chief.

782
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:02,521
What Are You?
Her Assistant?

783
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,691
Heh. If I Were
Her Assistant,

784
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,626
Do You Think I Would
Let Her Out Of The House

785
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:10,528
Wearing That Skirt
With That Hat?

786
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,899
Sorry. Um...No.

787
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:15,801
I Am Avalon Greene,

788
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:18,736
Co-Editor-In-Chief.

789
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:18,736
Yes, We're A Team.

790
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,505
You're A Team?

791
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:22,508
That's Adorable.

792
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:24,343
I Hate It.

793
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:26,477
What? Why?

794
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,546
Because If I Buy
Your Webazine,
On Staffing It

795
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,748
With My Own Underpaid
Web Designers.

796
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:34,753
However, I Want One Of You
On Board As Editor

So<I> Geekly Chic  Maintains
That Fresh Voice

Of Zit-Faced Kids
Everywhere.

799
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:42,493
Sort Of Breaks Up Your
Little Team, Doesn't It?

800
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:45,630
So...Flip A Coin, Girls.

801
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:47,499
Who Shall It Be?

802
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:49,535
Wait, You're
Asking Us To Choose

803
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:51,403
Which One Of Us Gets
To Live Our Dream?

804
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,738
( Groans )
Sounds So Terribly Sad

805
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,407
When You Put It That Way.

806
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,041
Don't Put It That Way.

807
00:37:57,075 --> 00:38:00,713
But--But We're
Best Friends.

808
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:02,881
We Worked Really
Hard On This.

809
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:05,783
How Could We Compete
With Each Other
For A Job?

810
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:08,119
Hmm. I Understand.

811
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:10,455
I Once Had
A Best Friend Myself.

812
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:11,889
We Were So Close.

813
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:14,459
In Fact, I Got Her
Her First Job.

814
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,894
Really? As What?

815
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,894
My Maid.

816
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:19,531
But She Wasn't Very Good,
So I Fired Her.

817
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:21,066
But Back To You Two.

818
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:23,401
I Have An Idea.

819
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:25,003
To Make This Fair,

820
00:38:25,035 --> 00:38:26,771
I'll Give Both Of You
One Week

821
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,474
To Come Up
With A Cover Story

822
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,675
Of Our Very First Issue
Of<I> Geekly Chic.

823
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:32,578
Whoever Does The Best Job

824
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:35,080
Gets To Be My Senior
Editor-In-Chief.

825
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:36,982
But--But We Worked
Really Hard.

826
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:38,484
And This Is Kind Of
Like A Joint Effort.

827
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:39,685
This Is Not Fair.

828
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:41,053
It's Either One Of You...

829
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:44,656
Or None Of You.

830
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:47,059
You Can Pack Up Your Bagpipes
And Go Now.

831
00:38:49,628 --> 00:38:50,829
Go.

832
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,463
Oh, Sorry.

833
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,463
Sorry.

834
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,066
Okay. Bye.

835
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,066
Okay.

836
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:01,140
This Is The Worst Day.

837
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:03,408
This Is
The Worst Skirt.

838
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:05,577
And Hat.

839
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:05,577
Ohh!

840
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:19,457
So...Have You Found
Anything Interesting Yet
To Write About?

841
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,993
Not Really. You?

842
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,561
No.

843
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:28,066
Can You Believe
This Is All I Can Afford
For Breakfast?

844
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,501
Since When Did Pancakes
Go Up $1.50?

845
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,471
I Need To Collect
My Belt Rent.

846
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:34,506
Not Now, Kendall.
I'm Busy.

847
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,774
How About You, Avalon?

848
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:39,076
I'm Not Really Busy.
I Just Don't Really Care.

849
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:42,680
I Found It.

850
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:42,680
A Sock To Stuff
In His Mouth?

851
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,883
No, Better.
You Know That Indie
Singer Jean-Frank?

852
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:49,888
He's Coming To America
For His First Concert
Outside Of France.

853
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:53,158
Um, Excuse Me. How Is This
More Important Than Me
Getting My Pancakes?

854
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:56,495
Because Jean-Frank
Has An Amazing Sound.

855
00:39:56,528 --> 00:39:58,129
We've Been Following Him
Online For Months,

856
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,131
And Once He Comes Here
And Performs Live,

857
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,667
He's Gonna Blow Up.

858
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,667
Exactly.

859
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,202
That's Why He Needs
To Be Interviewed Now

860
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:06,205
Before He's So Hot That
Everybody Wants Him.

861
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:08,907
This Would Make
An Awesome Cover Story
For<I> Geekly Chic.

862
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,775
Um, That's<I> My Story.

863
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:13,479
Your Story?
But We Thought Of It
At The Same Time.

864
00:40:13,512 --> 00:40:15,180
That Editor Job
Is Mine.

865
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:16,782
No, It's Not.
It's Mine.

866
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:19,017
Uh, Hate To Burst
Both Your Bubbles,

867
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,685
But It Looks Like
Neither Of You Is Gonna
Get To Interview Him.

868
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:22,521
What?!

869
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:22,521
What?!

870
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,522
Says Here Jean-Frank's
Concert's Sold Out.

871
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,591
So, Unless You Two
Can Find Tickets...

872
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:36,969
Man, Did It Just Get
Suffocatingly Hot In Here.

873
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,637
I'm Getting
Into That Concert.

874
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,606
Really? And Then What?

875
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:42,608
Let's See You Get
An Interview With Him.

876
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,943
You Get All Flustered
Around People, Remember?

877
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:48,280
I'm The Only One
Who Can Talk To Him.

878
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:50,749
Well, You Might Be
Able To Talk The Talk,

879
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:53,551
But Let's See You
Write The Right...

880
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,753
Words. Ahem.

881
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,789
I'm Not Losing Out
To You.

882
00:40:57,821 --> 00:41:00,658
Took The Words
Right Out Of My Mouth.

883
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:07,733
<I> ( Busy Signal )

884
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:17,175
Here. You Need This
More Than I Do.

885
00:41:17,207 --> 00:41:20,077
Ah, Thank You.

886
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:21,547
Oh, Very Nice,
Very Nice.

887
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,014
Shh.

01:04:33,169 --> 01:04:35,539
I've Never Seen Them
Before In My Life.

1407
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:37,441
Me, Neither.

1408
01:04:37,474 --> 01:04:40,243
( Both Laugh )

1409
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:43,379
My Mum Would Kill Me
If She Saw Me
Eating Mall Food.

1410
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:45,349
And I'm Not Even
Using A Napkin.

1411
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,584
I Never Do.

1412
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:53,490
So, You Have Three
Little Brothers
And A Dog.

1413
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:55,191
How Great Is That?

1414
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:56,527
Not If You're Hungry.

1415
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,328
And Murray's Not
Technically Mine.

1416
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:00,396
He Belongs To
This Guy Jake,
Who's Crazy Cute

1417
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:03,033
And I Have A Major Crush On,
But I'd Die If He
Ever Found Out.

1418
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:05,169
Savannah, Your Life
Sounds Totally Insane

1419
01:05:05,202 --> 01:05:07,204
And Totally Awesome.

1420
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:09,039
Me? Emma, You're
The One Cruising Around
In Limos All Day

1421
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,541
And Mall-Hopping
With Frederick.

1422
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:13,010
Pemberly, And It's Not
As Easy As It Sounds.

1423
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:14,745
Please. If I Could Have
Your Life For One Week,

1424
01:05:14,778 --> 01:05:16,580
I'd Be The Happiest Girl
In The World.

1427
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,718
Okay, Everybody's
Thinking It,

1428
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,586
So We're Just Gonna
Go Ahead And Say It--

1429
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:25,189
It's Time For
The Old Switcheroo.

1430
01:05:25,222 --> 01:05:28,425
What Are We
Switcheroo-Ing?

1431

01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,428
Yeah, So Just
Trade Up For One Week,

1433
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:33,730
And It'll Be
Totally Awesome.

1434
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,631
Or A Disaster.
Either Way,

1435
01:05:35,664 --> 01:05:37,567
It's Going On

1436
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,570
This Is Just Too Good
Not To Blog.

1437
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,437
Wait, You're Saying
For One Week,

1438
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:43,039
I'm Going To Be Her?

1439
01:05:43,073 --> 01:05:45,576
And I'm Gonna Be Her?

1440
01:05:43,073 --> 01:05:45,576
I Love It!

1441
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:48,178
I Get To Have
Three Brothers, A Dog,

1442
01:05:48,211 --> 01:05:50,046
And No School Uniform
For A Week!

1443
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,148
And I Get To Have
A Huge House

1444
01:05:52,182 --> 01:05:55,551
And All The Food

Pemberly,
Be Right Back.

1448
01:06:01,658 --> 01:06:04,261
We're Just Going
To The Washroom.

1449
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:07,498
You Go, Girls.

( Both Laugh )

1451
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:12,268
Shall We?

1452
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:25,381
I Can't Believe
We're Doing This.

1453
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:27,751
I Know, But It's Such
A Brilliant Idea.

1454
01:06:34,091 --> 01:06:35,526
Uh, You Okay
Riding That Home?

1455
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:37,660
I'll Be Fine.
Good Luck.

1456
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:39,729
Oh, Did I Mention
There's Five People

1457
01:06:39,763 --> 01:06:41,532
Living In My House,
And One Bathroom?

1458
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:42,765
No.

1459
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:45,168

( Sighs )

1462
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:50,673
How Hard Can This Be?

1463
01:06:50,707 --> 01:06:52,343
It's Just A Skateboard.

1464
01:06:54,144 --> 01:06:56,613
See? Easy As--Aah!

1465
01:07:25,242 --> 01:07:27,477

Can You Take These
For Me, Pemberly?

1474
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:58,274
Now, Don't Forget,
Miss Emma--

Hello, Father.

1501
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:28,431
Did You Just
Call Me "Father"?

1502

Uh, I--
Just Kidding...Dad.

1503

Whatever Happened
To "Pops"?

Here, Mind Putting
The Napkins Out?

1505
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:42,946
Yeah, I Know It's
Kind Of Formal, But--

1506
01:09:42,979 --> 01:09:45,849
Uh, Exactly What
I Was Thinking.

I'm Just Going To Go
Freshen Up First...

A Lovely Tradition.

A Little Game We Play.

01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:59,975
I Want My Life Back.

1583
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:59,975
Me, Too.

1584
01:13:00,008 --> 01:13:03,046
I Had No Idea Being Rich
Could Be So Exhausting.

1585
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:05,014
Did I Say I Wanted
A Big Family?

1586
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:07,650
I Take It Back.
I Love Being An Only Child.

1587
01:13:07,684 --> 01:13:09,820
Let's Switch Back
Tomorrow, Okay?

1588
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:12,154
Pemberly: Ahem.
Excuse Me, Miss Emma.

1589
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:13,722
I've Come To Remind You
That You Have A--

1590
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:15,459
Please Don't Say
Another Lesson.

1591
01:13:15,492 --> 01:13:16,927
I Can't Feel My Legs.

1592
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:19,162
No. You Have A Date
With Lance.

1593
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:21,063
He's Waiting Outside.

1594
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:23,434
Lance? Who's Lance?

1595
01:13:24,766 --> 01:13:26,068
Pemberly,
Can I Tell You

1596
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:27,671
A Little Secret?

1597
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,909
( American Accent )
I'm Not Really Emma.

1598
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:34,543
I'm Savannah.

1599
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:36,946
( Gasps )
No. I'm Shocked.

1600
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:38,615
You Won't Tell?

1601
01:13:38,647 --> 01:13:40,550
Please.
You Have No Idea

1602
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:42,152
The Secrets I Keep
Around Here.

1603
01:13:42,185 --> 01:13:44,588
That's Why
My Christmas Bonus
Is So High.

1604
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:48,859
Lance Is Your Boyfriend.

1605
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:54,698
Ahem. Lance Is Waiting...
Miss Emma.

1606
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,768
Hey, Emma.

1607
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:00,203
You're Lance?

1608
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:02,204
Who Knew I Had Such
A Hottie Boyfriend?

1609
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:04,975
I Mean...I Knew.

1610
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:07,077
I Just Have To Keep
Reminding Myself.

1611
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:09,079
Well, We Do Make
A Magnificent Couple.

1612
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,080
Heh. So, Ready To Go
Down To The Field?

1613
01:14:11,114 --> 01:14:12,816
The Softball Field?

1614
01:14:12,849 --> 01:14:14,985
Ha Ha! The Polo Field.

1615
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:19,689
Oh, Guess What?
I Named One Of My Ponies
Emma...After You.

1616
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:22,258
Uh, Aren't You
A Little Old
To Have A Pony?

1617
01:14:22,292 --> 01:14:26,596
It's A Polo Pony.
It's A Horse.

1618
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:29,632
Oh. Oh, Of--
Of Course It's A Horse.

1619
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:33,570
I Knew That.
Just Horsing Around!

1620
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:35,672
Shall We Go, My Lady?

1621
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,209
Hi, I'd Like To Make
An Appointment
For A Manicure.

1622
01:14:40,243 --> 01:14:43,079
Tomorrow? Perfect.

1623
01:14:43,111 --> 01:14:44,748
Hey, Savannah.

1624
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:47,850
Hey...To You, Too.

1625
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:49,685
I Just Sent You
The Coolest Video

1626
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:51,555
Of Murray Dancing
The Macarena.

1627
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:54,590
Murray?
Oh, You're Jake!

1628
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:56,091
She's Right--
You<I> Are Cute.

1629
01:14:56,124 --> 01:14:57,827
Who's "She"?

1630
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:00,096
I Mean, Me.

1631
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:01,864
She's Me.

1632
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:04,633
You Think I'm Cute?

1633
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:07,270
Way Cute. I Guess
I've Just Been Too...

1634
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:09,605
Shy To Tell You
That Before.

1635
01:15:13,709 --> 01:15:15,878
Would You Like
To Go Out With Me?

1636
01:15:15,912 --> 01:15:18,080
I Thought
You'd Never Ask.

1637
01:15:18,114 --> 01:15:20,884
( Both Chuckle )

1638
01:15:20,917 --> 01:15:23,852
Aah! I Have A Date
With Jake? No Way!

1639
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:26,122
I Know. I'm Good, Huh?

1640
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:27,923
I Get So Nervous
Around Him.

1641
01:15:27,957 --> 01:15:29,593
I Always Say
The Wrong Thing,
And Do Dumb Stuff,

1642
01:15:29,626 --> 01:15:31,727
Like Show Him My Guns.

1643
01:15:31,761 --> 01:15:33,930
I'm Not Even Going
To Ask About That.

1644
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:36,865
I'll Tell You What--
I'm Going To Be You
For One More Day

1645
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:39,669
So That I Can Go Out With Jake
And Show You How Easy It Is
To Be With Him.

1646
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:41,771
<I> Just Don't Let Him
See You There.

1647
01:15:41,803 --> 01:15:44,574
Don't Worry.
I'm Gonna Be Invisible
Around Jake.

1648
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:52,214
Jake, I'm So Glad
We're Finally
Going Out Together.

1649
01:15:52,248 --> 01:15:54,618
Personally, I Think
It's Long Overdue.

1650
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:56,752
I Didn't Know
You Felt This Way
About Me.

1651
01:15:56,785 --> 01:15:59,355
I Mean, You're
Usually So, Um...

1652
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:02,092
Independent.

1653
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:03,926
Right, But A Girl
Can Be Self-Reliant

1654
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:07,930
And Still Be Interested.

1655
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:10,065
I Don't Know What's
Different About You,
Savannah,

1656
01:16:10,099 --> 01:16:12,836
But I Like It.

1657
01:16:12,869 --> 01:16:15,005
( Laughs )

1658
01:16:19,409 --> 01:16:23,079
( Gasps )

1659
01:16:19,409 --> 01:16:23,079
Who Threw That?

1660
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:25,849
I'm Gonna Go Yell
At That Busboy.

1661
01:16:30,453 --> 01:16:32,722
Okay, That Was
Really Gross.

1662
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:34,423
You're Lucky
I Didn't Throw
The Busboy At You.

1663
01:16:34,457 --> 01:16:36,258
What Were You Doing
Holding Hands With
My Boyfriend?

1664
01:16:36,292 --> 01:16:38,261
Your Boyfriend?
If It Weren't For Me,

1665
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:40,262
He Wouldn't Even Know
You Existed.

1666
01:16:40,296 --> 01:16:42,798
Oh, So, Now He's<I>
Your Boyfriend?

1667
01:16:40,296 --> 01:16:42,798
Maybe So.

1668
01:16:42,832 --> 01:16:45,334
That Doesn't Matter,
Because I Happen To Have
A Boyfriend Of My Own.

1669
01:16:45,368 --> 01:16:48,370
Yeah, Like Who?
You Can't Even Talk
To Guys?

1670
01:16:48,404 --> 01:16:51,841
Lance Doesn't Mind.
Less Talking,
More Hugging.

1671
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:54,977
Lance Is<I> My Boyfriend!

1672
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:54,977
Not Anymore.

1673
01:16:55,011 --> 01:16:56,713
See You Around
The Polo Fields,
Savannah!

1674
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:02,785
Jake?

1675
01:17:02,819 --> 01:17:04,821
This Is My
Favorite Place

1676
01:17:04,854 --> 01:17:06,388
For, You Know,
Bumping Into People.

1677
01:17:06,422 --> 01:17:08,458
I Wouldn't Know
Anyone Here.

1678
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:11,895
Oh, Wait A Minute.
Is That My Pool Boy?

1679
01:17:11,927 --> 01:17:15,131
Hmm. I'd Know For Sure
If He Was Holding Some
Towels Or Something.

1680
01:17:15,163 --> 01:17:18,233
For Reals? Lance,
Do You Ever Even
Listen To Yourself?

1681
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:20,936
Only When I Sing Karaoke.
I'm Quite The Entertainer.

1682
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:24,207
No, I Prefer<I> Looking
At Myself.

1683
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:26,408
Oh, By The Way,
Are My Bangs Clumping?

1684
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:29,412
Jake: Come On, Murray!

1685
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:29,412
Quick, Put Your
Arm Around Me!

1686
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:31,947
( Barking )

1687
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:31,947
( Laughter)

1688
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,316
Did I Say Here?
I Meant Over There.

1689
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:37,153
( Overlapping Chatter )

1690
01:17:37,186 --> 01:17:39,022
Ahem! Savannah.

1691
01:17:39,055 --> 01:17:41,224
Emma, How's It Going?

1692
01:17:41,257 --> 01:17:43,059
Whoa. You Two
Could Be--

1693
01:17:43,092 --> 01:17:45,128
Yeah, We Know--
Twins.

1694
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,297
So, Have You Met
My Boyfriend Lance?

1695
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:50,867
Isn't He Cute
And So Squeezable?

1696
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:50,867
Aah!

1697
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:53,870
No Scrunching.
Italian Leather.

1698
01:17:53,903 --> 01:17:57,873
Italian Leather!
Isn't He...Divine?

1699
01:17:57,907 --> 01:17:59,476
Wait. I Just
Got An Idea.

1700
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,944
How About
We All Go Out
On A Double-Date?

1701
01:18:01,977 --> 01:18:03,980
Wouldn't That
Be Cool?

1702
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:05,814
Not Really.

1703
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:07,316
That's A Great Idea.
In Fact,

1704
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:08,852
What Are You Doing
This Saturday?

1705
01:18:08,885 --> 01:18:10,320
You Could Come To
My Birthday Ball.

1706
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:11,921
<I>Your Birthday Ball?

1707
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:13,989
That's<I> My...

1708
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:16,092
Favorite Thing To Do.

1709
01:18:16,124 --> 01:18:19,194
We'll Be There.
Let's Go, Guys.

1710
01:18:19,227 --> 01:18:20,896
( Groaning )

1711
01:18:22,899 --> 01:18:26,002
Wow, He Acts
Like He Knows You.

1712
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:28,404
Miss You, Too, Murray.

1713
01:18:30,373 --> 01:18:35,879
( Woman Singing Opera )

1714
01:18:35,912 --> 01:18:37,780
( Yawns )

1715
01:18:58,167 --> 01:19:00,570
I've Never Seen You
In A Dress Before,
Savannah.

1716
01:19:00,602 --> 01:19:04,173
Really? Never?

1717
01:19:04,207 --> 01:19:06,142
Well, I Mean,
Since Fourth Grade,

1718
01:19:06,175 --> 01:19:08,244
When You Started
Wearing Pants To Ride
Your Skateboard.

1719
01:19:09,945 --> 01:19:12,881
That Pretty Much
Sealed The Deal For Me.

1720
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:15,452
I've Had A Major Crush
On You Ever Since.

1721
01:19:17,485 --> 01:19:21,023
So, You Like
All That Tomboy Stuff
She Does--<I> I Do?

1722
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:23,092
I Even Like Your Guns.

1723
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:26,896
Didn't They Used
To Be Bigger?

1724
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:29,332
( Song Ends )

1725
01:19:34,203 --> 01:19:37,173
Jake, I Think There's
Someone Here You Should
Get To Know Better.

1726
01:19:38,574 --> 01:19:41,077
Thank You!

1727
01:19:38,574 --> 01:19:41,077
Ohh.

1728
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:43,446
( Overlapping Chatter )

1729
01:19:45,914 --> 01:19:49,185
Oh, You Look
Gorgeous.

1730
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:52,020
Oh.

1731
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:56,325
Wow. Emma, I Thought
I Was The Best-Looking
Person At This Party,

1732
01:19:56,359 --> 01:19:58,093
But You Have
Got Me Beat.

1733
01:19:58,127 --> 01:20:00,930
Wait.

1734
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:02,965
Nah, You Got Me Beat.

1735
01:20:02,998 --> 01:20:05,501
Wait.

1736
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:08,338
Nah, It's Your Party.
I'll Let You Have It
This One Time.

1737
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:11,573
Thanks, Lance.

1738
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:13,609
You're So...Generous.

1739
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:16,445
I Am, Aren't I?
Ha Ha!

1740
01:20:20,615 --> 01:20:22,551
What Are You
Looking For?

1741
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:24,419
Just Seeing If Savannah
And Jake Are Here
To See This.

1742
01:20:24,453 --> 01:20:26,890
The Dog Park People?

1743
01:20:26,922 --> 01:20:30,325
Who Cares About Them?
They Are Not Our Kind.

1744
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:32,562
Not Our Kind?

1745
01:20:32,595 --> 01:20:34,931
Lance, Remind Me Again
Why We Started Dating.

1746
01:20:34,963 --> 01:20:37,332
Because Mumsy And Daddy
Set Us Up In
The Third Grade.

1747
01:20:37,365 --> 01:20:40,302
They Wanted Me To Marry
Somebody Just Like Me.

1748
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:43,306
But--But Emma's
Nothing Like You!

1749
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:45,240
She's Sweet
And Kind And--

1750
01:20:45,274 --> 01:20:47,644
Uh, Hello? You're
