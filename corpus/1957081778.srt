00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,333
[birds chirping]

173
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,541
[woman] Coo-ee! Only me!

174
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,416
- [door opens]
- [woman sighs]

175
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,791
Hello, darling.

176
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,458
- [door closes]
- [woman chuckles]

177
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,333
[footsteps approaching]

178
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,541
[woman sighs]

179
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:09,666
Hi.

180
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,083
Hmm.

181
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,875
What are you doing
sitting here in the dark?

182
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:16,833
Nothing.

183
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,125
You need some light and fresh air in here.

184
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:26,958
Hmm, why don't you take your book out
onto the lawn?

185
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,708
Or do your exercises.

186
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:32,666
Remember what the doctor in rehab said.
You've gotta keep your spirits up.

187
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,583
[Sam whispers] Yeah.

188
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:37,750
Or try one of those podcast thingies.

189
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,250
I bumped into Bron in the supermarket,

190
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,666
and she reckons
she can be hanging out the washing

191
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,375
and solving a murder all at the same time.

192
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,166
[grunts]

193
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,666
I'd love to have a special lunch
when Kylie gets back.

194
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,208
Sorry?

195
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,458
What did you say, darling?

196
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,250
I didn't say anything.

197
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,500
Oh, thought you did.

198
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:07,875
[sighs]

199
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,916
Didn't Cam change these sheets?

200
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,791
[Sam] Just leave them, please, Mum.

201
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,333
[woman] Oh dear.

202
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,291
What's this?

203
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,791
[sighs]

204
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,750
[birds continue chirping]

205
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,000
- [dramatic music playing]
- [water churning]

206
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,750
[boys chattering indistinctly]

207
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,708
[Rueben] Well done.

208
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,500
[Oli] Well, it fits over here.

209
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,916
[birds squawking]

210
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,208
- A cool cubby…
- [Rueben] Great.

211
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,041
[Oli] One of my speakers there.

212
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,500
[bird cheeping]

213
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:10,958
[cheeping continues]

214
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,375
[cheeping intensifies]

215
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,958
- [lizard hissing]
- [cheeping continues]

216
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,958
[hissing]

217
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,791
Hey. Hello.

218
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,041
[cheeping continues]

219
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,250
Are you okay?

220
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,250
[cheeping continues]

221
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,291
Maybe you should've left it there.

222
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,250
She would have died, Mum.

223
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,333
- [cheeping]
- She fell a long way.

224
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,875
[Cam] Let's keep her fluids up
in the meantime.

225
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,791
I just think it'd be better off
at the vet.

226
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,500
[Oli] Is it a boy or a girl, do you think?

227
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:09,750
Well, says here a magpie's gender
can't be determined until after a year.

228
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,708
So, we don't know.

229
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,541
- [Noah] It's a girl.
- [Cam] How do you know?

230
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,875
[Noah] Well, I just do.

231
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,708
Well, she needs a name.

232
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,583
No, Cam.

233
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,166
No names, please.

234
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,875
Got enough to worry about around here.

235
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:25,791
Penguin.

236
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,500
[Cam] Penguin? Why?

237
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,666
'Cause she's black and white.

238
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,958
Oh, okay.

239
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,416
- How about… Zebra?
- [Cam] Skunk?

240
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,625
- Panda?
- [Cam] Panda's good.

241
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,500
No, how about Magician's Wand?

242
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,791
- Chessboard.
- [Oli] How about Soccer Ball? Tuxedo?

243
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:43,125
- [Cam] Very good.
- Penguin.

244
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:46,125
Her name's… Penguin.

245
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,083
[cheeping]

246
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,291
[crickets chirping]

247
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,458
[cheeping]

248
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,541
It's all right, Penguin.

249
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:07,666
Shh.

250
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,375
[cheeping continues]

251
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,291
[mellow music playing]

252
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:25,458
[cheeping continues]

253
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,541
[Noah] <i>Sometimes it's hard</i>
<i>to believe what happened.</i>

254
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,541
<i>It's like Mum was stolen from us.</i>

255
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,333
<i>She used to surf with us,</i>

256
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,958
<i>skate with us,</i>

257
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,125
<i>play soccer in the sand with us.</i>

258
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,375
<i>She was awesome.</i>

259
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:51,750
[Rueben] Come on.

260
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,166
[boys chattering indistinctly]

261
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,625
[Rueben] Whoo! Let's go! Come on!

262
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,708
- [Oli] Look, Peng. Look at me.
- [cheeping]

263
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,500
- Funny, Peng.
- [chuckles]

264
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,541
[Rueben] Oh, wait.

265
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:06,833
Did she just poo on you?

266
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,291
She needs a nappy.

267
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,291
[Rueben] You do.

268
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,041
[Oli] No, you do. For your farts.

269
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,083
I don't mind.

270
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,416
[Rueben] Hey, Peng. This is how you fly.

271
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,875
- Don't!
- [Rueben] Woo-hoo!

272
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:20,750
- Flying.
- [laughs]

273
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,833
[blowing raspberries]

274
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,291
Ignore him, Peng.

275
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,625
- [Rueben] You try, Noah, you chicken.
- [Oli chuckles]

276
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,166
Can you feel this?

277
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,333
Can you feel this?

278
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,083
No.

279
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,791
[Oli] That's cool, like a superpower.

280
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,333
[inhales]

281
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,916
[Penguin cheeping]

282
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:55,833
[Noah] Mum?

283
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,208
Penguin's talking to you.

284
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,958
[cheeping]

285
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,000
What?

286
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,333
Why don't you like her?

287
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,375
She's a wild bird,

288
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,458
which means
she can't stay here forever. Right?

289
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,041
[cheeping continues]

290
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:15,416
[Noah] Come on, Peng.
You've gotta get your strength back.

291
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,291
[Rueben]
She obviously doesn't like it, Noah.

292
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:18,208
She should.

293
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:21,125
I made it like they said online,
with bugs and stuff.

294
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:24,041
Why don't you try it?
See what it tastes like then?

295
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,375
[Noah] Shut up, Rueben.

296
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,583
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.
- [boys] Hey, Dad. Hi, Dad.

297
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,541
It was supposed to be
a normal family portrait.

298
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,875
Turns out
they all hate each other's guts.

299
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:35,958
And mine too, apparently,
so that was a bit of fun.

300
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,958
- [Penguin cheeping]
- [Cam] Hey.

301
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,583
How are you?

302
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,083
How's the pain? One to ten?

303
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,166
I'm fine.

304
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,583
- [cheeping continues]
- And you?

305
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,083
- G'day, gorgeous.
- [Noah giggles] Aw.

306
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,666
- [Cam] Gesundheit.
- [Rueben] She sneeze?

307
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,833
Okay, so look, I was thinking
we could have fish and chips for dinner.

308
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,333
- [boys exclaiming]
- Eat on the beach?

309
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,750
- Can I bring Peng?
- Of course you can bring Penguin.

310
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:01,916
I could carry you, Sam.

311
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:03,958
No.

312
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,958
It's beautiful down there. Come on.

313
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,750
No. You guys go.

314
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:08,666
I'm…

315
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,541
I'm gonna get ready for bed.

316
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,791
- [Rueben] Come on, Mum.
- It's too early for bed, Sam.

317
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:13,875
[Oli] Please, Mum?

318
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:15,750
Sorry, bub.

319
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,625
Hey, bring me back a shell, okay?

320
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,875
- Hey. Come on. Let's go.
- [Rueben] I bet I can beat you.

321
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,208
- I'll race you to the bedroom.
- [Cam] Towels, togs, let's rock!

322
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,500
- Oli, come on.
- Yes.

323
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,750
[cheeping continues]

324
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,333
[Rueben and Oli giggling in distance]

325
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,875
[cheeping continues]

326
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,833
Never ask me that question
in front of the boys again.

327
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,500
[softly] What question?

328
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,458
[shakily] How am I?

329
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,291
I don't wanna have to lie to them.

330
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,333
[Rueben] Dad, where are my swimmers?

331
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,250
Okay.

332
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:07,708
[exhales]

333
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,208
[breathing heavily]

334
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:15,791
Don't.

335
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,125
[mellow music playing]

336
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,208
[waves crashing]

337

[birds chirping]

338
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,166
- [Noah] Do you miss your mum?
- [cheeping]

339
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,083
[mellow music continues]

340
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,333
Oli.

341
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,291
Give this shell to Mum.

342
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:50,750
[Oli] Thanks, Noah.

343
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:53,833
Hey, Peng.

344
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,916
Come and watch this. [grunts]

345
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,458
- [Rueben] This is delicious, Dad.
- [Noah and Oli giggle]

346
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,500
- Mmm.
- [Noah] Come on, Peng.

347
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,541
[Rueben] Why don't you have one, Peng?

348
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,458
- [Oli] Want one, Peng?

with the paddle instead of your hands.

They must be good for something.

I can't do that either.

944

Don't make me tip you out, Sam.

945
00:54:58,791 --> 00:54:59,833
You wouldn't.

946
00:54:59,916 --> 00:55:02,458
Oh, I tip people all the time.
I'm known for it.

947
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:15,750
I can't.

01:02:25,958 --> 01:02:28,625
Coming. Coming [chuckling]

1058
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:32,041
- [sighs]
- Hi, Nan Jan.

1059
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:33,958
Hi.

1060
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:34,875
[unlocks door]

1061
01:02:35,666 --> 01:02:36,541
- Hey, Nan.
- Hello.

1062
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:37,916
- [all] Hi.
- [Jan chuckles]

1063
01:02:39,208 --> 01:02:42,625
- [Penguin squawking]
- Oh, you brought Penguin. How nice.

1064
01:02:43,458 --> 01:02:46,500
- Hi, Mum.
- Hello, sweetheart. Happy birthday.

1065
01:02:46,583 --> 01:02:47,708
Thank you.

1066
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:49,666
- Quickly, quickly, carry.
- Hurry. Come on.

1067
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:51,375
- Hide them, quick.
- Come on.

1068
01:02:51,458 --> 01:02:53,291
[squawking]

1069
01:02:55,375 --> 01:02:57,416
[chuckles] Thanks, Kyles.

1070
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,916
Oh, Sammy, you're so old.

1071
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,458
[both laugh]

1072
01:03:02,958 --> 01:03:04,458
Uh, I'll wear it well.

1073
01:03:04,541 --> 01:03:06,000
And I got you bubbles, but I got...

1074
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:08,125
Look, I got the cheap stuff
'cause you can't taste it.

1075
01:03:08,208 --> 01:03:11,250
- Oh great. Thanks. Keep it coming.
- [Kylie] Yeah. Love you.

1076
01:03:11,333 --> 01:03:12,875
- [both kiss]
- [Kylie] I love you.

1077
01:03:12,958 --> 01:03:14,166
Kylie!

1078
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:17,250
This table isn't gonna set itself.
Come on.

1079
01:03:17,333 --> 01:03:19,916
- Okay. Okay, Mum.
- [Jan] And use the good napkins.

1080
01:03:21,083 --> 01:03:23,958
I have waited over a year for this.

1081
01:03:24,041 --> 01:03:25,625
[chuckles] Thanks, Mum.

1082
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:28,708
Oh no.

1083
01:03:29,291 --> 01:03:33,041
Oh, I swear that bird
does it to me just to annoy me.

1084
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:34,583
- [squawking]
- [doorbell rings]

1085
01:03:34,666 --> 01:03:36,541
- [Sam] Sorry, Mum.
- [Rueben] I'll get it.

1086
01:03:36,625 --> 01:03:39,041
- [Sam] Thanks, Roo.
- Do you have to be inside?

1087
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:40,458
[Noah] She didn't mean to.

1088
01:03:41,458 --> 01:03:43,333
[woman shrieking]

1089
01:03:43,416 --> 01:03:45,166
- Shoo, shoo! Shoo!
- That'll be Gaye.

1090
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:47,708
[Noah] Sometimes she
thinks toes are worms.

1091
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:51,166
- [Penguin squawks]
- Oh! Sorry. Sorry, Jan.

1092
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:54,125
- So, Gaye, you reckon Sam's got a shot?
- Oh yeah.

1093
01:03:54,208 --> 01:03:57,458
So, she'll be spending a lot of time
in the water?

1094
01:03:57,541 --> 01:03:59,208
Yeah, training three times a week.

1095
01:03:59,291 --> 01:04:02,791
It sounds dangerous.
And Sam can't swim, can you?

1096
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:05,375
[Gaye] Don't you worry, Jan.
I haven't drowned a student yet.

1097
01:04:05,458 --> 01:04:08,541
But my ex-husband, well…
that's a whole other story.

1098
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:10,166
[all laughing]

1099
01:04:11,625 --> 01:04:13,541
You know, um, my… my students,

1100
01:04:13,625 --> 01:04:15,958
they… they usually take
a long time to find their balance…

1101
01:04:16,041 --> 01:04:18,250
There you go, Peng, some fresh air.

1102
01:04:18,333 --> 01:04:21,958
[Gaye] …took to it
like a duck to the water, this one.

1103
01:04:22,041 --> 01:04:25,500
Honestly, it's the first time
I've felt normal since the accident.

1104
01:04:26,083 --> 01:04:28,958
When I'm kayaking,
I look like everyone else.

1105
01:04:29,041 --> 01:04:31,666
Well, thank goodness for Gaye. [chuckles]

1106
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:34,375
Someone's gotta get Sam out of the house,
be proactive.

1107
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:35,458
[Sam] Mum, please.

1108
01:04:35,541 --> 01:04:37,875
Mum, what...
That's what Cameron does every day.

1109
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:40,708
- I wasn't saying that.
- [Kylie] Mm-hmm.

1110
01:04:40,791 --> 01:04:42,041
I didn't mean that, Cam.

1111
01:04:42,125 --> 01:04:44,625
- [Cam] I know.
- [Jan] All I'm saying is it's very hard.

1112
01:04:44,708 --> 01:04:47,125
You've got your work. Sam's often alone.

1113
01:04:47,208 --> 01:04:49,375
She likes her independence, Jan.

1114
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:51,208
- But she can't walk.
- [Sam] God.

1115
01:04:52,208 --> 01:04:53,583
I'm right here, Mum.

1116
01:04:53,666 --> 01:04:56,041
How much independence should she have?

1117
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:58,500
- Mum, I'm three feet away from you.
- [Jan] No, really.

1118
01:04:58,583 --> 01:04:59,416
Please.

1119
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,833
- [Jan] What if something awful happened?
- [Sam] Oh God, Mum.

1120
01:05:01,916 --> 01:05:04,583
She has her phone, Jan. She'd call.

1121
01:05:04,666 --> 01:05:07,333
Yeah, what if she fell
or there was a fire?

1122
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:11,125
Hey, boys!
Um, how about you go jump in the pool?

1123
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:13,041
[plates clanking]

1124
01:05:13,125 --> 01:05:15,333
- Take your plates.
- [Rueben] Oh, it was just getting fun.

1125
01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:18,083
- [Oli] Will we still get cake?
- [Rueben] Of course we will, ding-dong.

1126
01:05:18,166 --> 01:05:20,708
- [Noah] It's chocolate.
- [Oli] Don't call me a ding-dong.

1127
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:22,666
What if she couldn't reach her phone?

1128
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:25,000
- [Sam] Oh my God.
- [Jan] What if it wasn't charged?

1129
01:05:25,083 --> 01:05:27,208
We don't talk in what-ifs, Jan.
We live our life.

1130
01:05:27,291 --> 01:05:29,083
- [Sam] Cam, don't.
- [Jan] Oh yes.

1131
01:05:29,166 --> 01:05:33,083
All fun and no responsibility.
Look where that's got you.

1132
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:36,500
- I might, uh, go for a swim as well.
- Please sit down, Gaye.

1133
01:05:36,583 --> 01:05:38,416
- It's fine.
- And, Jan, if you're implying...

1134
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,333
No, she's not implying. It's just…

1135
01:05:40,416 --> 01:05:42,375
Leave her alone.
She's drunk and emotional.

1136
01:05:42,458 --> 01:05:43,500
I heard that.

1137
01:05:43,583 --> 01:05:46,208
Well, yes, of course.
You're three feet away, Mum.

1138
01:05:46,291 --> 01:05:48,125
- When your poor father died...
- Oh.

1139
01:05:48,208 --> 01:05:49,625
- I'm just... Okay.
- [Cam] Sit, please.

1140
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:51,666
[Sam] No, no, please. May as well stay.

1141
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:55,666
When your poor father died, I thought,
at least I've still got the girls.

1142
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:59,416
But now
I just lie awake at night worrying.

1143
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,458
And I don't?

1144
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:02,333
All I ever do is worry.

1145
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:06,750
I worry if I'm too happy in front of Sam
or too sad in front of the boys.

1146
01:06:06,833 --> 01:06:09,166
I worry if I should take them
to the beach

1147
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:12,208
or if that's us being selfish. I worry…

1148
01:06:12,291 --> 01:06:14,750
I worry if I do too much for Sam
or not enough.

1149
01:06:14,833 --> 01:06:15,666
[Jan] I know.

1150
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:17,958
I worry Sam can't walk
because I moved her after she fell.

1151
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:20,250
No, darling,
that's got nothing to do with it...

1152
01:06:20,333 --> 01:06:22,375
Believe me, Jan. I worry.

1153
01:06:22,458 --> 01:06:24,250
I'm sorry, love. I'm just…

1154
01:06:25,416 --> 01:06:26,666
I'm just scared.

1155
01:06:27,375 --> 01:06:29,958
I wanna make my little girl well again,
and I can't.

1156
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:33,458
- And it makes me crazy. I just...
- Shh.

1157
01:06:33,541 --> 01:06:35,041
Well, don't shush me.

1158
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:36,041
No, no, no. Shh.

1159
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:38,125
- Can you hear that?
- [Cam] What?

1160
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:39,583
Is that Penguin?

1161
01:06:39,666 --> 01:06:41,083
[squawking]

1162
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:48,166
- [Cam] Hey! Hey! Leave her alone!
- [banging]

1163
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:49,833
- [Sam] Oh no!
- [Kylie] Penguin!

1164
01:06:49,916 --> 01:06:51,083
[Cam] Back up!

1165
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:52,500
- Penguin!
- [Kylie] Penguin!

1166
01:06:52,583 --> 01:06:54,083
- [Cam] Leave her alone!
- Hey!

1167
01:06:54,166 --> 01:06:56,208
- What's happening?
- Hey!

1168
01:06:56,291 --> 01:06:58,791
[all shouting indistinctly]

1169
01:06:58,875 --> 01:07:00,458
Penguin!

1170
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:03,500
- [all clamoring]
- [birds squawking]

1171
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:05,000
Penguin!

1172
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:09,083
- [clamoring continues]
- [squawking continues]

1173
01:07:09,166 --> 01:07:10,375
Penguin!

1174
01:07:10,958 --> 01:07:11,833
- Hey!
- [Noah] Dad!

1175
01:07:11,916 --> 01:07:13,791
Leave her alone, you mongrels.

1176
01:07:13,875 --> 01:07:15,041
Oh no.

1177
01:07:15,125 --> 01:07:16,041
No!

1178
01:07:16,125 --> 01:07:17,666
[boys] Penguin! Penguin! No!

1179
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:18,750
- Peng!
- [Noah] Penguin!

1180
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:20,083
Peng!

1181
01:07:20,166 --> 01:07:21,208
[Noah] Come back!

1182
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:22,125
[Oli] Penguin!

1183
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:24,333
- [Noah] Peng!
- [Rueben] Peng!

1184
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:26,791
[breathing heavily]

1185
01:07:28,208 --> 01:07:29,166
[Noah] Come back!

1186
01:07:29,791 --> 01:07:31,708
- [Oli] Penguin!
- [Rueben] She went down there.

1187
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:35,750
Oh, sweetheart. [kisses]

1188
01:07:36,875 --> 01:07:37,708
Come on.

1189
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:42,708
[dramatic music playing]

1190
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:50,833
Penguin!

1191
01:07:53,208 --> 01:07:54,708
[Jan] I knew it.

1192
01:07:54,791 --> 01:07:57,416
Not an umbrella amongst the lot of you.

1193
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:00,166
We're about to head home.
There's no point in this weather.

1194
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:01,833
Maybe she's at the beach.

1195
01:08:01,916 --> 01:08:03,791
It's getting dark, Snow.

1196
01:08:03,875 --> 01:08:05,833
Just five more minutes, please.

1197
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:07,708
You're all gonna get sick.

1198
01:08:07,791 --> 01:08:09,875
Let's give him five more. Go! Go!

1199
01:08:12,208 --> 01:08:13,500
Penguin!

1200
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:17,041
[Cam grunts]

1201
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:18,416
Why did they do it?

1202
01:08:19,291 --> 01:08:21,041
Penguin wouldn't hurt anyone.

1203
01:08:21,125 --> 01:08:22,125
[Noah] Peng!

1204
01:08:22,208 --> 01:08:24,500
Magpies are territorial, mate.

1205
01:08:24,583 --> 01:08:26,791
Technically, this isn't Penguin's home.

1206
01:08:27,291 --> 01:08:28,208
It's theirs.

1207
01:08:28,291 --> 01:08:30,125
[Noah] Penguin!

1208
01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:32,000
But we're her home.

1209
01:08:32,083 --> 01:08:34,375
I know, sweetheart. I know.

1210
01:08:35,333 --> 01:08:36,875
[Noah] Penguin!

1211
01:08:50,166 --> 01:08:51,166
[sighs]

1212
01:08:53,791 --> 01:08:55,333
[thunder rumbles]

1213
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:17,333
[thunder rumbles]

1214
01:09:35,416 --> 01:09:36,333
[sighs]

1215
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:50,958
[Noah] <i>…other days it could have broken.</i>

1216
01:09:52,416 --> 01:09:53,666
<i>But it waited for Mum.</i>

1217
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,708
<i>And I'm the one who took her there.</i>

1218
01:09:59,916 --> 01:10:02,583
<i>I wish it was me who leant on that fence.</i>

1219
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:07,000
<i>I wish it was me who broke my back.</i>

1220
01:10:09,083 --> 01:10:09,916
[gasps]

1221
01:10:29,166 --> 01:10:30,000
[exhales]

[fireworks exploding]

1224
01:10:45,333 --> 01:10:46,958
Is it New Year's Eve?

1225
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:50,500
No.

1226
01:10:51,083 --> 01:10:52,916
Then why are there fireworks?

1227
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:55,000
I don't know.

1228
01:10:57,666 --> 01:10:59,166
'Cause sometimes

1229
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,750
nice things just happen.

1230
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:04,083
[fireworks continue exploding]

1231
01:11:09,416 --> 01:11:10,750
Are you mad at Noah?

1232
01:11:16,666 --> 01:11:18,666
'Cause anyone could've let her out.

1233
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:21,625
I know.

1234
01:11:28,875 --> 01:11:30,291
[Noah] Penguin!

1235
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,375
[dogs barking in distance]

1236
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:37,500
Peng!

1237
01:11:39,083 --> 01:11:40,375
Penguin!

1238
01:11:41,708 --> 01:11:43,291
[dogs continue barking]

1239
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,875
Penguin!

1240
01:11:53,666 --> 01:11:54,583
Peng!

1241
01:11:58,625 --> 01:12:00,625
[dramatic music playing]

1242
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:15,958
[birds squawking in distance]

1243
01:12:47,666 --> 01:12:48,708
You all right, Snow?

1244
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:55,875
Do you think she's dead?

1245
01:12:56,666 --> 01:12:58,583
Jeez, Roo, no.

1246
01:12:58,666 --> 01:13:00,291
She's just scared.

1247
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:03,875
Give her time to find her way home.
She knows where we are.

1248
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:07,125
And Penguin's tough.
Isn't that right, Sammy?

1249
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:08,041
Noah?

1250
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:13,708
He's okay. He's just…

1251
01:13:14,208 --> 01:13:16,375
[Sam] Noah, it's not your fault.

1252
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:18,375
[Cam] Of course it's not your fault.

1253
01:13:18,875 --> 01:13:20,583
[Sam] You've got to stop this.

1254
01:13:21,125 --> 01:13:22,541
You've gotta let it go.

1255
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,583
You're not to blame for Penguin,
and you're not to blame for my accident.

1256
01:13:27,666 --> 01:13:30,750
[Cam] Okay. Okay. Let's not turn this
into something it's not. Just...

1257
01:13:30,833 --> 01:13:33,333
- He thinks he is. Don't you, Noah?
- [Cam] Oh, Sam.

1258
01:13:33,416 --> 01:13:34,750
Why do we have to talk about this?

1259
01:13:34,833 --> 01:13:37,208
Because I'm tired of not talking about it.

1260
01:13:38,166 --> 01:13:39,541
Please don't walk away.

1261
01:13:43,041 --> 01:13:46,375
You say I'm not to blame, Mum,
but you don't mean it.

1262
01:13:46,458 --> 01:13:47,583
[Cam] Of course she means it.

1263
01:13:47,666 --> 01:13:49,458
You don't know anything, Dad.

1264
01:13:49,541 --> 01:13:53,041
- Hey, hey, that's enough.
- You don't see the way she looks at me.

1265
01:13:53,125 --> 01:13:55,416
- Inside voices, mate...
- Oh, shut up, Cam.

1266
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:01,000
Please, Noah, if you've got
something to say, just say it.

1267
01:14:04,791 --> 01:14:07,583
Please. I need you to talk to me.

1268
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:13,541
It's my fault we went up that tower.
It was my idea.

1269
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:15,583
I'm the reason you broke your back.

1270
01:14:16,791 --> 01:14:17,833
You happy?

1271
01:14:18,916 --> 01:14:20,708
No, I'm not happy.

1272
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:24,500
And sometimes I think
I'll never be happy again

1273
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:26,208
but not because of you.

1274
01:14:26,708 --> 01:14:30,500
Then why don't you ever wanna talk
to me or be near me?

1275
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:34,625
- I don't know. I've made lots of mistakes.
- [Noah] You hug Oli all the time.

1276
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:36,291
- You can't look at me!
- I'm scared.

1277
01:14:36,375 --> 01:14:40,250
I'm just terrified that all this anger
will just come spewing out of me.

1278
01:14:41,375 --> 01:14:44,125
Not just at you, at all of… all of you.

1279
01:14:44,208 --> 01:14:46,916
Me too. You, Cam.

1280
01:14:49,875 --> 01:14:52,375
[inhales] And I wish…

1281
01:14:52,458 --> 01:14:57,083
[inhales] …every day, I wish
we'd never gone on that bloody roof!

1282
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:00,791
But we went.

1283
01:15:02,458 --> 01:15:04,916
That was our decision.

1284
01:15:05,833 --> 01:15:06,791
Not yours.

1285
01:15:09,375 --> 01:15:10,625
You're not to blame

1286
01:15:10,708 --> 01:15:11,750
for any of it.

1287
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:13,291
I promise.

1288
01:15:14,375 --> 01:15:16,416
It was just a piece of old, rotten wood.

1289
01:15:20,041 --> 01:15:23,500
I'm sorry I haven't been strong enough
to help you understand that.

1290
01:15:25,333 --> 01:15:26,541
Or help you through it.

1291
01:15:27,833 --> 01:15:30,791
I didn't think I was strong enough
to get through it myself.

1292
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:32,875
But I am.

1293
01:15:34,708 --> 01:15:35,916
And I know that now.

1294
01:15:39,416 --> 01:15:40,541
[exhales deeply]

1295
01:15:42,333 --> 01:15:43,208
I'm here.

1296
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:47,041
I'm your mum.

1297
01:15:52,166 --> 01:15:53,416
The same mum.

1298
01:16:12,333 --> 01:16:14,333
[inspirational music playing]

1299
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:29,416

- Bye, Mum.
- [kisses]

1303
01:17:25,666 --> 01:17:26,541
Bye, sweetie.

1304
01:17:28,166 --> 01:17:29,083
[Rueben] Bye, Mum.

1305
01:17:31,916 --> 01:17:32,750
See ya.

1306

[kisses]

1307
01:17:46,166 --> 01:17:48,041
[Sam] Have a good day, darling.

1308
01:17:48,125 --> 01:17:48,958
You too.

[chuckles]

1311
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:15,708
- [Cam] Finally.
- Oh.

1312
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,500
Okay then.

1313
01:18:20,666 --> 01:18:21,916
I give up.

1314
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,541
What's this all about?

1315
01:18:23,625 --> 01:18:24,833
[Noah] We're going out.

1316
01:18:25,333 --> 01:18:27,958
We're not spending another night staring
at Penguin's basket.

1317
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:29,708
We're going out for fish and chips.

1318
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:34,583
And I need a blindfold to go to the beach?

1319
01:18:34,666 --> 01:18:36,708
Well, who said anything about the beach?

1320
01:18:36,791 --> 01:18:37,625
Boys.

1321
01:18:38,125 --> 01:18:40,416
[Sam giggles] What are you up to?

1322
01:18:41,041 --> 01:18:42,916
- Oh my gosh.
- [Cam] We've got you.

1323
01:18:43,916 --> 01:18:46,916
[Rueben] Three, two, one.

1324
01:18:47,833 --> 01:18:51,625
- [in unison] Ta-da!
- Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta-da-la!

1325
01:18:51,708 --> 01:18:53,666
[Sam] It's just Gaye.

1326
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:58,000
It is not just Gaye.
It's Gaye and Gaye's truck.

1327
01:18:58,083 --> 01:18:59,791
- [Cam] Boys, let's go.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1328
01:18:59,875 --> 01:19:02,291
- [Sam] Oh, hi, Bron.
- Surprise?

1329
01:19:03,166 --> 01:19:05,333
Don't look at me.
No one tells me anything.

1330
01:19:05,416 --> 01:19:07,500
- [Sam] What is going on?
- One, two, three.

1331
01:19:07,583 --> 01:19:08,750
[boys] Ta-da!

1332
01:19:08,833 --> 01:19:10,041
Your chariot awaits.

1333
01:19:10,125 --> 01:19:12,583
- [Rueben] Bags having to go after Mum.
- [chuckles]

1334
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,666
We're going out

1335
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:16,875
for fish and chips.

1336
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:25,166
Only if you want to.

[Gaye grunts]

1338
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:36,375
Okay.

1339
01:19:37,625 --> 01:19:38,458
Drive!

1340
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,541
- And drive, babies!

- [Gaye] Oh, thank God.
- [Sam] Oh, thank you, guys.

1350
01:20:24,875 --> 01:20:28,166
- [Gaye] Over here?
- [Kylie] Thank you. Yep, just here.

- [Cam] Hey.
- Hey.

1360
01:22:04,833 --> 01:22:07,250
That was pretty sneaky.

1361
01:22:07,333 --> 01:22:08,875
[chuckles] Yeah.

1362
01:22:14,333 --> 01:22:15,625
[exhales deeply]

1363
01:22:23,166 --> 01:22:24,541
Ask me that question.

1364
01:22:29,458 --> 01:22:30,375
Which question?

1365
01:22:32,083 --> 01:22:34,375
The one I told you never to ask me.

1366
01:22:40,125 --> 01:22:41,083
How are you?

Thank you, Cam.

It's not.

1379
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:42,000
- [Rueben] That's Penguin.
- Oh.

1380
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:43,791
- [Noah] It's Penguin!
- [chuckles]

1381
01:23:43,875 --> 01:23:46,500
- She's back! She's back.
- Penguin, Penguin, Penguin!

Penguin!

1383
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:52,000
