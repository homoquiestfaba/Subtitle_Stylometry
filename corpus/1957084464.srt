00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,288
Everyone, close your eyes.

00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,462
Mafia... open your eyes.

7
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,886
Mafia... kill someone.

00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,641
Mafia... close your eyes.

It's morning. Wake up.

13
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,759
Last night,
the Mafia killed someone.

14
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,053
The Doctor didn't
guess correctly.

15
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,138
And who was killed...

16
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:19,640

(LAUGHING)

22

Look at her. She's delighted.

Okay.

24
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,825
Who thinks it's, Mohsen?

25
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,328
You're making a mistake.
Raise your hand.

26
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,497
You'll see.

27
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,123
Who thinks it's, Farhad?

28
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,795
Who thinks it's, Neda?

29
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,423
Come on.

30
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,009
Neda, defend yourself.

31
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,803
You're making a mistake.

32
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,806
One of you guys is a citizen.

33
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,267
You're making me
out to be the Mafia.

34
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,977
You're letting them win.

35
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,770
Anyone buy that?

36
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:08,480
Thank you very much.

37
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:09,606
Sorry Neda.

38
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,233
You've been condemned to death.

Your last words.

My last words?

41

Babak, look after our baby.

42
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,782
I lost the game.

43
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,784
It's just a game, sweetheart.

44
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,245
Don't worry about Shabnam.
I'll find her a sweet mommy.

45
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,874
My ghost will find you
and pluck your eyes out.

46
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,667
You're giving me goosebumps.

47
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,043
Not funny.

48
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,503
The Mafia is the winner.

49
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,839
Neda and Sara were
both citizens.

50

See, I told you.

51
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,387
But you two are so good at lying.
It's hard to believe a word you say.

52
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,847
Who was it then?

53
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,099
Obviously it was, Babak.

54
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:45,184
Babak and Mohsen.

55
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,269
I told Farhad but he's too
stubborn.

56
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,772
Come on.
Let's get some shots.

57
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,149
Forget this.

58
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,318
Where did you put it?

59
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,402
It's in the freezer.

60
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,905
Neda, check on Shabnam.
Make sure she's not up.

61
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,865
She's asleep.
The monitor is in my pocket.

62
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,409
I guess I'll get the
barbecue ready.

63

I know this brand.

64

65

You'll be fine, give it up.

66
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,834

69
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,050
I'm breastfeeding.

70
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,513
It's good for you.
It'll keep the baby asleep all night.

71

- He's crazy.
- Want one?

72
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,224
I'll take one.

73
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,434

Just a couple shots for
my toothache.

80
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,120
I'm serious.
I don't want to deal with it.

81
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,455
Just take it easy.

82
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:49,706

to take care of you.

her sleep.

me like that?

on a second baby?

When Barbod grows a
little I'll have my second.

That's a handful.

be alone. It's not fair.

waited before you had her.

You were alone in
Iran while Babak was here.

Look at you.

142
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,379
I didn't know you got a tattoo.

143
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,173
I wanted the swelling
to go down first.

00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:45,549
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

Does Babak like it?

146
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:47,968
The other half is on his arm.

147
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:48,969
How fancy.

148
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:49,970
I know.

149
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,889
I wanted one like yours.

150
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,933
When we both decided
to get it, I put it here.

151
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:56,101
What is it?

152
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:57,311
I really don't know.

153
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,687
It was in the tattoo
artist's book.

154
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,730
You don't know?

155
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:00,814
You're special.

156
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,107
Well, it's very unique.

157
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:10,908
What is it?

158
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:17,122
This toothache's been
killing me all night.

159
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,083
I could have brought you
something from the hospital.

160
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,797
It came on so suddenly.

161
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,222
Have you quit?

162
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,558
Sort of.

163
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,813
Neda's sensitive to it.
She's asthmatic.

164
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,274
I don't smoke in the house.

165
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,571
Neda okay? Is she settled?

166
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,535
We got into it again.

167
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,331
She's homesick.

168
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,751
She's trying to like it
here for Shabnam's sake.

169
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:04,711
Are you two happy?

170
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:09,132
She's happy, and I'm happy.

171
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,927
That's great.

172
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,808
You're hardly around
these days, Doctor.

173
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,854
Since I was transferred
to emergency...

174
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:22,938
...my job has become difficult.

175
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,984
How hard could it be?
You stick people with needles.

176
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,070
What do you know?

177
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,826
Ever been in a situation...

178
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:40,038
...where someone is brought
to the ER under your watch,

179
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:43,584
and as hard as you try
to save them...

180
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:44,960
...there is no way?

181
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,673
This morning, a young girl came in at
3:00 a.m.

182
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,216
She was my last patient.

183
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,189
Did you know her?

184
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,869
