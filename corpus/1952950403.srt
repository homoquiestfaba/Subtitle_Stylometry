1
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,353
Hold the door.

2
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,188
Give me a hand.

3
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,874
What if he comes in ?

4
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,873
Don't worry, he can't.

5
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,557
What if he finds a way in ?

6
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,512
l bet we can find some good food
in this house.

7
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,592
You think so ? Do you think
they have chocolate, too ?

8
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,756
Maybe. Wanna find out ?

9
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,155
Come on !

10
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,955
Look what l found.

11
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,998
- Are they chocolate ?
- Yes, chocolate, too.

12
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,159
No thanks, l'm full.

13
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,716
l wonder who these guys are.

14
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,434
l don't know. Probably
the family who used to live here.

15
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,312
Where are they now ?

16
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,991
l don't have a clue,
but the house is ours tonight.

17
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,957
- Did you like the biscuits ?
- Yes. What book is this ?

18
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,071
lt's not a book,
it's a diary.

19
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,599
What's a diary ?

20
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,879
lt's a notebook where you write
everything that happens every day.

21
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,316
- Why ?
- So that... you won't forget.

22
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,879
Whose is it ?

23
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,397
l think it belonged to the boy
who used to live here.

24
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,750
Do you think he would mind
if we read a little from it ?

25
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,836
l don't know...
Do you want us to ?

26
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,989
Let's see...

27
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,868
l found something.

28
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,033
''Friday, May 23rd.
Today started like any Friday.''

29
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,753
''l was in school,
during the English class.''

30
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,748
- Are you in the story ?
- Yes, because l'm reading it.

31
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,151
l want to be in it, too.

32
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,518
- Who do you want to be ?
- l want to be a princess.

33
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,912
Okay, you'll be the princess
and l'll be the storyteller.

34
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,237
Now, do you want to hear
how the adventure starts ?

35
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,759
Ahmed started swearing,
like he always does.

36
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,551
l renounce Satan and all his works.

37
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,473
- Who are these guys ?
- The bad guys. The mobsters.

38
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,188
''Dou you renounce Satan ?''
''Yes, l renounce Satan.''

39
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,679
The fat guy is one of the bad guys ?
l like him.

40
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,757
Wait for the rest of the story.

41
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,468
What gun would James Bond wear
with this suit ? Glock or Beretta ?

42
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,634
l don't know about that
James Bond of yours,

43
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,870
but l know what Margelatu
would choose.

44
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,271
- Again with that Margelatu ?
- Yes, Margelatu.

45
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,358
My dear ! Hurry,
your Mom is waiting for you.

46
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,393
- Okay.
- Quick.

47
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,995
Glock.

48
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,869
Granny's dearest, bye !

49
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,791
Bless us, Father !

50
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:45,679
Blessed is the Kingdom of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,

51
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,078
now and forever,
until the end of time.

52
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,158
Amen.

53
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,639
We baptize God's servant Radu,
in the name of the Father, amen,

54
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,196
and of the Son, amen,
and of the Holy Ghost, amen.

55
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,111
Now and forever,
until the end of time.

56
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,358
Police ! Nobody move !

57
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,188
Arrest him !

58
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,237
Police ! Nobody move !

59
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,354
Take those hoods off !
You're in the church !

60
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,992
Don't move, ma'am !

61
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,240
- We're on duty, granny.
- What duty ?!

62
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,711
- Do you copy ?
- Yes.

63
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,396
Everybody out !

64
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,308
Arrest him !

65
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,635
According to Article 328 of the
Penal Code, you are under arrest.

66
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,629
Hands up !

67
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,355
Take him away !

68
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,195
Nobody moves !

69
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,959
Tell him l won't say a word,
no matter what happens.

70
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,398
He is under arrest.

71
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,159
Give me the baby.

72
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,670
Why did you take off your hoods ?
You compromised your cover.

73
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,069
We're in a church.

74
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,240
So what ? You'll be doing
night rounds from tomorrow,

75
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,396
dealing with hobos and drunkards.

76
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,114
Yes. What ? Understood.

77
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,989
Why did you send the SWAT guys
to arrest Prodan ?

78
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,071
He's just a petty accountant.

79
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,879
We didn't want to risk any surprises
when we arrest Spanu.

80
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,678
We suspect he's working for him.

81
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,876
You've arrested him on a suspicion ?

82
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,992
lt's more than just a suspicion.
Look !

83
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,990
Manase is Prodan's cousin,
Spanu's right hand.

84
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,354
Prove me you have a case,
or you're finished.

85
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,755
We've asked the Financial Guard
to comb through Prodan's companies

86
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,512
and they found something.

87
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,596
Those guys always find something.

88
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,228
We've got clear evidence
of tax fraud.

89
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,869
And ?

90
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,194
We'll make Prodan give us Spanu,
we take Spanu and let Prodan go.

91
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,000
You want to lock up Spanu
for tax fraud ?

92
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,559
lt worked with Capone.

93
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,958
lt's just an example.

94
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,512
Did you talk to his wife ?

95
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,794
He didn't deny.

96
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,998
Come on, she's leaving.

97
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,515
Let's go !

98
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,989
But be careful,
they're dangerous.

99
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,912
- Okay, goodbye.
- Bye.

100
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,670
l don't understand. Why did they take
the boy's father ?

101
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,517
Do you remember when l stole
those bottles last year ?

102
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,910
The boy's father stole bottles ?

103
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,232
Something like that. The kid
and his mother are alone now

104
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,152
and they have to take care
of each other.

105
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,834
Like us.

106
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,590
To the right ! Stop ! Go back !

107
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,428
- Come on, you idiot !
- Shut up !

108
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,549
We lost her !

109
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,672
Hello. How can l help you ?

110
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,076
Get out, what are you waiting for ?

111
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,033
- Keys !
- What keys ?

112
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,191
- The car keys.
- l don't have them.

113
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,753
The boss is gonna kill us.

114
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,430
Did you hear that ?
He must have gotten in.

115
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,595
Come on !

116
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:17,915
Don't be afraid. Pretend there are
two people, not the dog.

117
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,834
Two people ?

118
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,157
They're here to pay a visit.
They came in a car.

119
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,071
Officer Bumbescu, Precinct 5.

120
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,069
My respects.

121
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,110
l feel embarrassed
to use a gun like this.

122
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,631
Carpati, semiautomatic.

123
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,394
You can't kill yourself with this thing.
You'll miss point blank.

124
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,432
Why did you stop ?

125
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,479
l want to be around her
one more minute.

126
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,434
Around whom ?

127
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,239
The wife of the guy
we arrested today.

128
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,392
What do you care about her ?

129
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,393
Didn't you see the way she was looking
at me in the church ?

130
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,199
That's because you arrested
her husband.

131
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,469
You're such an idiot !

132
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,396
The black one is nice.
And so big.

133
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,037
lt's a gas guzzler.

134
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,200
There's something fishy
about those two.

135
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,156
Let's wait and see what happens.

136
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,230
Nothing is going to happen.
We're wasting our time.

137
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,793
She's the godmother of my child.

138
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,071
Her husband put in a good word
for me with the Boss.

139
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,595
Radu is my cousin once removed.
My mother and his mother are...

140
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,948
Manase...

141
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:29,073
l wonder if the Boss wants
to harm her or her son.

142
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,634
l don't know, Manase...
What do you think ?

143
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,034
Let's get to work !

144
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,113
- Wait, wait...
- What ?

145
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,078
Who are those two ?

146
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,993
l don't know them,

147
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,473
but they look like pros.

148
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,598
l think l'll have a heart attack
from this chewing-gum.

149
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,671
This is worse than an audit.

150
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,994
They've got guns.

151
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,908
We should call a couple more guys
with heavy guns.

152
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,031
Let's not take any chances.

153
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,152
Are you scared, Manase ?

154
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,231
No, but if they have guns
it's the end of story !

155
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,874
Wait ! Let's see how many
guys they have.

156
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,791
Help us, God !

157
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,634
l'm alive.

158
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,514
l'm alive !

159
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,477
l wonder who that guy is...

160
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,272
- Her lover.
- Right...

161
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,752
l wonder who that guy is.

162
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,035
- They're still there ?
- Yes.

163
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,431
- Where do you think you're going ?
- l've got some business.

164
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,272
You've got no business here...

165
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,275
Get him !

166
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,388
Why are you hitting me ?
You're such an idiot !

167
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,235
Get him !

168
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,915
Hit him !

169
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,554
- l've got him !
- lt's me ! Are you crazy ?

170
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,874
Get up !

171
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,672
They're letting him have it.

172
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,752
He's getting smacked down.

173
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:07,199
- Why do they beat him up like that ?
- Go ask them, if you dare.

174
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,390
Goons from Moldova.
They're cheap and mean.

175
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,798
They'll slice him up
and hide him in the basement.

176
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,669
He's banged up.

177
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,435
Let's get to work.

178
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,678
- Let's stop those two.
- Look at their guns !

179
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,157
Police ! Drop your weapons !

180
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,195
- My gun fired accidentally.
- What did l tell you, idiot ?

181
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,795
Come on, stand up !

182
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,835
Shitty guns !

183
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,198
He hit me in the head
with a gun !

184
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,678
Look at all the blood !

185
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:48,995
l'm good at throwing things,
did you see that ?

186
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,553
- Did you get him ?
- l got him.

187
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,635
The cops !

188
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,670
- Let's go, Manase !
- They cracked my skull !

189
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,358
The cops are coming !

190
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,638
We're the cops, you asshole !

191
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,791
We're not paid enough
for this.

192
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,035
Good evening.

193
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,790
She wants us to stay
till morning.

194
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,952
Don't fall asleep.

195
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,715
l'm cold.

196
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,555
Let's get up
and get the blood pumping.

197
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,069
Good girl !

198
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:58,397
Now imagine we're in a garden,
on a warm summer day.

199
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:04,073
We're patrolling the garden,
like officer Bumbescu.

200
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,190
- Can we listen to music ?
- Yes. Music !

201
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,432
l don't understand what he's saying.

202
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,955
When he's mad,
he speaks his language.

203
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,510
Mafia ? What do you mean ?

204
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,839
You're a cop, idiot.

205
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,154
l'm in, too.
Fuck my cop pay.

206
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,431
- Nobody's gonna hire us anyway.
- You think ?

207
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,158
- Are we in ?
- We're in.

208
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,515
- l don't have any ideas. Do you ?
- l've got no idea.

209
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,875
Tell her about the madman
at Cernica.

210
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,229
He's at Cernica.

211
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,031
The priest hit you really hard.
Does it hurt ?

212
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,553
- Leave me alone.
- Let me give you a kiss.

213
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,114
- Shut up !
- The pain will go away with a kiss.

214
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,472
What the hell are they doing ?

215
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,069
Spanu will be shocked
to see this.

216
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:54,712
He says he's thinking.

217
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:11,710
Police ! Put down your weapons !

218
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,433
Put down your weapons !

219
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,112
Put your weapons down !

220
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,550
Police ! Put your weapons down !

221
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,751
- She's nutty like a fruitcake.
- She's American, what do you expect ?

222
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,152
- To your left !
- Get him !

223
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:08,989
lt's the real deal.

224
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,798
She really scared him.

225
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,235
Did you see his face
when they started shooting ?

226
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,590
Princesses always win, right ?

227
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,072
Right. Let's see
how the story ends.

228
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,878
lsn't it over ?

229
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:45,153
Have you forgotten the kid's dad
is still in prison ?

230
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:47,994
Let's see.

231
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:59,311
How did you spend your days
in the monastery, priest ?

232
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:05,835
l spent my days praying and
learning Averroes' teachings.

233
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,359
Hello, godmother.

234
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:42,073
Hey, l've seen that fat guy
before.

235
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:47,514
You think so ?

236
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:32,116
She didn't like the flowers.
Lilies are for funerals.

237
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,118
Gerbera is for funerals.

238
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,114
You think so ?

239
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,350
Father, what the hell
are you doing ?

240
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:15,835
- Stefan ?
- Yes.

241
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:29,635
Good for you, Fane !

242
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:32,829
How is it ?

243
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,069
Put some more.

244
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:52,559
Don't move !

245
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:47,789
l don't care if it's closed.
Go buy diapers and tissues.

246
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:00,309
Cheers !

247
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:38,754
Police !

248
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:13,160
You're under arrest for illegal
possession of weapons.

249
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,554
Move ! Both of you.

250
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:44,396
No, l don't like this story !

251
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:46,992
Why ? What's wrong with it ?

252
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:51,073
lt shouldn't end like this. They
should all live happily ever after,

253
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:54,915
the way they do in all the tales with
castles and blonde princesses.

254
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:58,390
- Okay, l understand.
- And the bad guy must be punished.

255
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:00,799
You got it.

256
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:49,914
Come on up.

257
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:52,948
Look in the box.

258
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:13,349
Put it here !

259
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,159
Miss, stop !

260
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:24,631
Let them be, it's alright.
