            the perfect time    

124
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:54,052
            For this one,       
            didn't he? Huh?     

125
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,254
                Huh, Burt?      

126
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:59,057
        You know it's 2 weeks   
        before his birthday,    

127
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,226
        The one day that was    
        more important to him   

128
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,928
        Than his goddamn job,   

129
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:06,298
        And now he's managed    
        to fuck this up, too.   

130
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,133
            Sorry.              

131
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,401
            [sighs]             

132
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,503
        Nice work, pop.         

133
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,672
Is everybody coming?            

134
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,510
                Yeah. The asylum
                Will be full.   

135
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:21,279
I can't believe grandpa's       
not gonna be there.             

136
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,348
            I know, sweetie.    

137
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:25,917
            [beep]              

138
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,586
        You're doing            
        the right thing.        

139
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,155
         You're fully           
         experiencing the loss. 

140
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,425
        And when you're ready,  
        take a deep breath in...

141
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,760
            [inhales deeply]    

142
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,094
            Like that.          

143
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,763
        Try to really maximize  
        the feeling.            

144
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,331
            Feel it             
            really intensely.   

145
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,266
            And then            
            as you exhale...    

146
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,768
                [exhales]       

147
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,771
        Just try to let         
        those feelings go, ok?  

148
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,073
He just died.                   

149
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,275
        Yeah...I know.          

150
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,277
        But believe me,         
        it's the way            

151
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,446
        Your grandfather        
        would have wanted it.   

152
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,348
To be dead?                     

153
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,919
    Oh, where can she be?       

154
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,490
            Where's my little   
            tubby turtle?       

155
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,460
        I'm not a turtle.       
            I'm Katie.          

156
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,328
            Well, I'm looking   
            for someone         

157
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,830
            To help me eat...   

158
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,665
I will, pom pom.                

159
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,266
            A hot-fudge sundae. 

160
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,937
You ok?                         

161
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:55,273
Come on. Let's go               
find your grandmother.          

162
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,348
    Don't see why               
    you want to wait.           

163
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,850
        [door opens]            

164
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,518
    They have                   
    a right to know.            

165
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,854
                No. It's        
                my decision now.

166
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,355
    Fair enough.                

167
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,857
        Man: Hello? Mom?        

168
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:14,192
You have an appointment         
with the parson tomorrow.       

169
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,694
            I Don't think so.   

170
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,229
Man: There she is.              

171
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,864
            Danny boy.          

172
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,365
Hey, Lance.                     

173
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,933
        Good to see             
        you, son.               

174
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,034
    Grandma.                    

175
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,769
                    Oh, baby.   

176
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,371
                Oh...           
                You know what?  

177
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,707
            He loved you        
            and your daddy      

178
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:32,210
            More than anybody   
            else in the family. 

179
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,045
I know that's                   
not true, but thanks.           

180
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,514
                No. Really.     

181
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,048
            He couldn't even    
            remember the names  

182
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,850
            Of his other 2      
            children.           

183
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,085
        3 children.             

184
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:42,621
            Oh. Always thinking 
            of others.          

185
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,557
Hey, mom.                       

186
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,726
        Woman: Burt.            
    Burt, did you grab...       

187
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,928
I have to go.                   

188
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,596
Are you sure                    
you're ok?                      

189
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,899
        I feel as if I          
        finally have a Chance   

190
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,101
            To do something     
            with my life.       

191
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,302
    Good.                       

192
00:08:58,804 --> 00:08:59,905
Aah!                            

193
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,740
            Alice.              
        Glad to see you.        

194
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,909
Lance.                          
Katie, Katie, Katie.            

195
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,912
                Oh, Alice. What 
                are we gonna do?

196
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:10,081
I think I'll just               
take my old room                

197
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,216
And then...Danny.               

198
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,918
                Hey, Alice.     

199
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,587
Oh, I was just waiting          
to see you on television, huh?  

200
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,255
        Well, you may not       
    have to wait very long.     

201
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,590
        I actually--            

202
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,125
Right. I'm just--               
mother...                       

203
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,260
God! I'm trying                 
to get to the sorrow.           

204
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,564
I really am, but I              
still feel so angry.            

205
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,433
I mean, I want to just          
grab him and shake him          

206
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,502
And say,                        
"how dare you?                  

207
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,771
"how dare you go                
out that back door              

208
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,940
"with your little               
suitcase?                       

209
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:38,743
I mean, where in god's name     
are you going this time?"       

210
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:46,117
I'm ok, though.                 
I'm ok. I'm sorry.              

211
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:49,321
            Oh! I've never heard
            you say that word.  

212
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:55,060
Well, we Don't have to make     
a talk show out of it, do we?   

213
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:56,795
            Burt!               

214
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,965
        Don't tarry.            
        Don't tarry.            

215
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,300
                Hi, Burt.       
                Hi, kids.       

216
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,368
        Hey, Burt.              

217
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,470
            We've had a very    
            difficult trip.     

218
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,472
    So we should probably       
        just consider           

219
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,974
        What everybody          
        wants to eat,           

220
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,376
    And that way, we can        
    just make one dish          

221
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,144
    That suits the group...     

222
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,146
    Katie, voice-over:          
Alice and her husband Burt      

223
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,849
    Had managed to produce      
    3 silent children.          

224
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,485
    Alice: My tribe only eats   
    bread and American cheese   

225
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,654
        In various forms,       
        so I mean...            

226
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:26,257
    I could make this dish      
I think everybody might enjoy,  

227
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,159
    This little casserole       
    that I like to make.        

228
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,828
    I'm sort of famous          
around my house for making it.  

229
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,564
    Have you said hello         
    to your grandmother?        

230
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:36,034
            Let me take a look  
            at you three.       

231
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,169
        Stop looking like       
        she's gonna bite you.   

232
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:39,738
        She's not gonna         
        bite you.               

233
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,540
    Stop it. Stop feigning      
    those fake little twitches  

234
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,009
        That you're doing.      
        We've talked...         

235
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,477
    Katie, voice-over:          
My grandmother always said      

236
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,345
        She wished Alice        
    came with a mute button.    

237
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,514
        Alice: If you think     
        it's any better         

238
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,016
        At any of your          
        friends' house,         

239
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,517
    If you think it's any       
    better at their house,      

240
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,185
You can just pack your bags     
    and move in with them.      

241
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,186
        [no audio]

        [doorbell rings]        

243
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,223
            Ah, that's better.  

244
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,360
            All right,          
            treat everybody     

245
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,362
            With respect, ok?   
            Let's try not to be 

246
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,364
            The biggest freaks  
            in the circus.      

247
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,033
        What the hell           
    is that supposed to mean?   

248
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,035
He wants us to say,             
"no, thank you,"                

249
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,037
Instead of                      
"eat my ass Jell-O."             

250
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,538
            Hey, stop it.       
            All right?          

251
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,873
            Stop it,            
            for Christs sakes. 

252
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,375
            Where do you guys   
            learn that shit?    

253
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:20,545
            Mom...              
            Sorry about dad.    

254
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,347
                Yeah...Mmm...   

255
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,016
                You remember    
                the boys.       

256
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,519
How could I forget them?        

257
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:28,720
                        Hey, g. 

258
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,255
        So, what did he         
            leave us?           

259
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,257
Your grandfather's will         
won't be read                   

260
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,225
Until after the funeral.        

261
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,960
                    Talk about  
                    being early.

262
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,564
    Seriously, man.             

263
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,232
        God, dude.              
    You always hit me first.    

264
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,801
                He pushed me.   

265
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,235
Hey, skipper.                   

266
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,570
                Hey.            

267
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:49,541
Alice: Oh, why do terrible      
things always come in threes?   

268
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,976
    I see Alice is already      
rifling through the drawers.    

269
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,578
No. I'm looking                 
for ingredients.                

270
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,281
I'm going to make us            
all dinner tonight.             

271
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,615
                    Hmm...      

272
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,250
            Hey, uncle skip.    

273
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,752
    Hey. Hi.                    

274
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,253
        Hey, boys.              

275
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,688
                Hi, Katie.      

276
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,425
        Katie, voice-over:      
    Uncle skip and the twins    

277
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,427
    Were a little heavy         
        with hormones,          

278
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,763
        But they were           
        at those ages.          

279
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,232
        I used to have          
        an aunt Lily, too,      

280
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,601
    But they scared her away.   

281
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,603
        Family legend           
        says it was             

282
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:21,106
        The night before        
    their eleventh birthday.    

283
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,441
                What the hell   
                is that?        

284
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,443
It's your birthday cake.        

285
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:28,046
I was hoping it                 
would be a surprise.            

286
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,280
                I'm more        
                than surprised. 

287
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,615
                I'm shocked.    

288
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,117
This isn't                      
what we ordered.                

289
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:34,119
        You Don't order         
        your mother.            

290
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,121
    I spent 2 days making--     

291
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,256
            We ordered an erotic
            cheesecake.         

292
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,791
        Excuse me?              

293
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:40,925
                You're excused. 

294
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,228
We'll fix it.                   

295
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:47,999
        Oh, no. Oh, god.

    Oh...What?                  

298
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,040
        What?                   

299
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,046
            They ruined it.     

300
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,983
             They ruined it.    

301
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,153
Well, it is                     
their birthday, right?          

302
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,822
            Where did they      
            even hear the term  

303
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,791
            "erotic cheesecake"?

304
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,993
Somebody's got to teach them    
these things, right?            

305
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,595
            What..."things"?    

306
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:20,732
            That you can make   
            a cheesecake        

307
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,501
            Look like           
            disembodied breasts?

308
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,572
    Or an ass.

            Katie, sweetheart,  
            I want you          

311
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,689
            To eulogize         
            your grandfather.   

312
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,759
Oh, grandma, I Don't think      
I can make a speech.            

313
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,861
I wouldn't know                 
what to say.                    

314
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,697
            If it were me,      
            I would want you    

315
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:57,035
            To say something    
            that made some...   

316

                out of my life, 

317

                Something       
                that honored me.

318
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,843
Hey, what about dad?            

319
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,377
Or skip? Or Lucy?               

320
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,213
                Your grandfather
                wanted you.     

321
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,881
                And you boys

                with the burial.

323
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:15,386
Your father left                
very specific instructions.     

324
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,821
                        Ok.     

325
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,691
        Hi, everybody.          

326
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,226
                Hey, ladies.    

327
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,560
            You remember skip?  

328
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:23,728
    Yeah.                       

329
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,063

331
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:27,765
        Close enough.           

332
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,567
Hi, guys. I'm, uh...            

333
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,135

believe you brought her.        

336
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,912
                Hello, Alice.   

337
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,948
No, it's just I thought         
you'd come alone. It's family.  

338
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,383
                Are you starting
                already?        

339
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,585
        Oh, no. It just...      
        It didn't occur to me   

340
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,387
        To bring my sex toys.   
    Did you bring any sex toys? 

341
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,589
            You wouldn't know   
            a sex toy           

342
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,825
            If it left a battery
            in your vagina.     

343
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,827
                Oh. My vagina,  
                as you were     

344
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,929
            So whimsically about
            to refer to it,     

345
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,098
            Has served          
            as sacred passage   

346
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,600
            For 3 anatomically  
            correct children.   

347
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,636
                    So...

Erase, erase.                   

349
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,673
    So, who needs a drink?      

350
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,376

    With a vengeance.           

353
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,636
This isn't                      
about you, so...                

354
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:42,640
                Are you talking 
                to the sex toy? 

355
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,810
I'm sure you're                 
a very nice...Lesbian.          

356
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,979
Is that                         
the preferred term?             

357
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,315
            No. No.             
            We prefer "whore."  

358
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:54,986
            I think all women do
            these days.         

359
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,821
    Well...                     

360
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,924
I guess I owe you               
an apology.                     

361
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,964
                Are you working 
                up to it?       

362
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,338
        So...                   

363
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,841
What do you girls do?           

364
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,812
            What do you mean,   
            "what do we do"?    

365
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,549
    For fun.                    

366
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:28,252
            We eat out,         
            go to the movies.   

367
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,021
Oh, normal stuff.               

368
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,856
            Drinks.             

369
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,358
            Ladies.             

370
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:34,859
Thank you.                      

371
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,362
                Thank you.      

372
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,397
                What did you    
                think we did?   

373
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,532
No, I didn't have a...          

374
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,534
I wasn't thinking               
of something,                   

375
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,437
And I just...I...               

376
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,441
I Don't know                    
what you do.                    

377
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,210
            Do you think        
            we spend all night  

378
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,845
            Triple-tonguing     
            our cheese pots?    

379
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,079
        Ah...                   

380
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,719
    It's my father's funeral,   

381
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,721
        So if you could         
            muster up           

382
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,657
Just a little bit of respect,   
        that would be...        

383
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,561
Don't worry...You know.         
Don't worry about Alice.        

384
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:14,065
You think she's gone,           
she comes back, you know...     

385
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,867
    Like herpes.                

386
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,403
                Thanks, skip.   

387
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,572
So, how are you                 
and Lucy doing?                 

388
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,408
            Well, I mean...     

389
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:26,411
            This is just awful. 

390
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:29,080
I know. I hate being            
around my family, too.          

391
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,581
                Oh.             

392
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,917
Yeah. But, I mean...            

393
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:36,587
How are you doing...            
You know...                     

394
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,356
    Physically?                 

395
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,558
                Physically?     

396
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,894
Well, yeah. I mean,             
like you said...What is it?     

397
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:44,395
Triple-tonguing.                
What is that?                   

398
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,231
Is that a thing...              
What are you doing?             

399
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,300
            Go talk             
        to your mother.         

400
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,968
You talk to her.                
She's a downer.                 

401
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,336
        She's a widow.          

402
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,038
She was                         
a downer first.                 

403
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,606
        Just go talk            
        to your mother.         

404
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:56,941
                    Excuse me.  

405
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,109
    Ok.                         

406
00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:59,444
Do you need                     
a punch?                        

407
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:00,778
 Do you want me                 
 to punch you?                  

408
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,080
            You have            
        real problems.          

409
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,614
You Don't do that.              
You Don't throw                 

410
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,149
A lemon at me                   
in front of a lesbian.          

411
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,951
Nice going.                     

412
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,120
    Danny: Me nice going?       
    "the triple-tongue thing"?  

413
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:10,521
                        Hi.     

414
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:17,161
                My dad died     
                when I was 11.  

415
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,397
    Oh.                         

416
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:20,965
                I'm sorry.      

417
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,134
            I Don't know        
            why I said that.    

418
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,639
What size are you?              

419
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,074
                        Me?     

420
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,848
Come upstairs.                  

421
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,617
This is the dress               
I wore on the boardwalk         

422
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:42,186
    In 1956.                    

423
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,022
                It's...         
                It's so elegant.

424
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,758
It's yours.                     
I wore it once.                 

425
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,494
 It was                         
 a great night,                 

426
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,496
Maybe the best                  
night of my life.               

427
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:52,964
It's a lucky dress.             

428
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,499
                    I couldn't. 

429
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,200
Oh, please.                     

430
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,668
Take them all.                  

431
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,004
I know we Haven't spent         
that much time together,        

432
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,839
But I already know              
I like you better               

433
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,541
Than I like Alice.              

434
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,009
                    Ha ha!      

435
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:09,113
And besides, Katie              
and Lucy aren't my size.        

436
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,450
                Thank you.

00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,697
            It's a little bit   
            runnier than usual. 

440
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,867
            Think I just didn't

441
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,703
                Put enough      
                cheese in it.   

442

        out of a horse.

Good idea.

00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,723
Yeah, it's                      
a good idea.

                it's fine.      

453
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:58,729
Well...

459
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,715
            Seems to give       
            a crap.             

460
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,584
Yeah, I've noticed.

469
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,935
        No. I called in         
        an order for Collins.   

470
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,604
                Let me check    
                on that for you.

471
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,272
What wedding?                   

472
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,341
                Judy and I are  
                getting married.

473
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,775
    Really?                     

474
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:46,777
                Vows            
                and everything. 

475
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:48,312
Congratulations.                

476
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,114
                I sent you      
                an invitation.  

477
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,616
No, you didn't.                 

478
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,117
            It's ok. Everybody  
            in the family       

479
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,619
            Is pretending       
            they didn't get it. 

480
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:55,953
I didn't get one.               

481
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,822
            I distinctly        
            remember weeding    

482
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:00,024
            The family invites  
            out early. No.      

483
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,293
            I went to the...    

484
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:03,861
                I put them...   
                Wait.           

485
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,297
                I mailed them.  
                I know it.      

486
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,465
                    Ah!         

487
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,134
                I am such       
                a bonehead!     

488
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:14,905
Stupid! Stupid!                 
Stupid! Oh! Well...             

489
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,974
                Here you go.    

490
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,309
            What are you doing  
            down there?         

491
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,477
    It's Ryan.                  

492
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,912
Little Ryan                     
from the be--aah!               

493
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,716
What are you doing?             
He could hear you!              

494
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:33,658
            Hi.                 

495
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,192
    Katie, voice-over:          
    Little Ryan...              

496
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,094
    My childhood friend.        

497
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,665
        Since before            
        I can remember,         

498
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:43,000
    We spent our summers        
            together.           

499
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:46,837
    (music) two fire-filled           
        car mats (music)              

500
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:50,007
        (music) never could           
    heed that warning (music)         

501
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,743
    (music) stay in the Sky (music)         

502
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,346
Katie, voice-over: He always    
acted like he had a crush on me,

503
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:58,582
    And I always acted          
    like I didn't notice.       

504
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,352
It seemed like nothing could    
    ever come between us...     

505
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:05,523
    Until the last night        
        of last Summer.         

506
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:10,061
    (music) a peculiar ride (music)         

507
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:16,033
        (music) 'cause this is        
        our last Chance (music)       

508
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:20,871
    (music) and to that big mistake (music) 

509
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:26,711
    (music) we are bound to make (music)    

510
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,713
    Katie, voice-over:          
    His parents were off        

511
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,715
    Camping somewhere           
    with his little brother,    

512
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,717
        And everything          
        was perfect--           

513
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,719
        The flicker             
    of the candlelight,         

514
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:38,222
    The gentle dancing          
    of the rain on the roof,    

515
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,325
     The familiar sound         
     of a car door slamming.    

516
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:42,860
        [car door slams]        

517
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,368
        Katie. Katie. Katie!    

518
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,904
    Katie, voice-over:          
        I never meant           

519
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,740
        For anything            
    to happen between us.       

520
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,742
    I couldn't let there be     
        any witnesses.          

521
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,744
Woman: I could                  
heat up some lasagna            

522
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:01,579
If you boys                     
are hungry.                     

523
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,547
Oh, hi...Katie.                 

524
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:08,352
Nice to see                     
you again.                      

525
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:17,261
                Let's hear it.  

526
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:18,329
            No.                 

527
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,663
                    Come on.    
                    Do it.      

528
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,931
            No.                 

529
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,600
One last time.                  

530
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,101
                    Ok.         

531
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,537
                This one's      
                for dad.        

532
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,009
        Something is stuck      
        to my tongue.           

533
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,344
                Oh! There it is.

534
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,478
        Wow.                    

535
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,647
                    If I ever...

536
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,115
Single bullet.                  

537
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,817
                To my left eye. 

538
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:42,486
This is a good time.            

539
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:43,788
         How can this be        
         a good time?           

540
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,122
        Your dad just died.     

541
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,458
My family could use             
a little good news.             

542
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,660
    Trust me.                   

543
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:54,298
        Hey, everyone,          
I have an announcement to make. 

544
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,300
        We sent out             
    some invitations--          

545
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,302
        Or at least,            
    I thought we did--          

546
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,971
And I was actually getting      
pretty angry at all of you.     

547
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,307
            I suspected         
        some sort of--ah.       

548
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,810
    Anyway, myself and Judy--   

549
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:08,479
                "Judy and I."   

550
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:10,481
Judy and I would like to--      

551
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,316
                    [sniffles]  

552
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:14,118
    What is it, Fred?           

553
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,786
                    It's Ted.   
                    Ha ha ha!   

554
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,154
        What are you            
        laughing at?            

555
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,489
I Don't know.                   

556
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,157
                But I can't wait
                to find out what

557
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,859
                You 2 vaginiuses
                are up to.      

558
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,194
        What did you            
        just say?               

559
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:24,728
Nice vocab word.                

560
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,497
        What did he             
        just call us?           

561
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:27,598
                    Vaginiuses. 

562
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,700
                It's a compound 
                compliment.     

563
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,335
        You see what            
        I put up with?          

564
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,504
    How can you tell me not to  
    scream my fucking head off? 

565
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:34,939
                    You're      
                    losing it.  

566
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:37,174
No! These are the people        
that you want at our wedding?   

567
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,677
            Oh, is one of you   
            getting married?    

568
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:40,678
We both are.                    

569
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:42,680
                    To who?     

570
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,015
To each other.                  

571
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,251
                    Ha ha ha.   

572
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,352
Awesome!                        

573
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,221
                How many friends
                can we bring?   

574
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:53,224
            Alice: Ha ha ha.    

575
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,826
            Oh, this is so rich.

576
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,962
                Katie: I think  
                it's great.     

577
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,697
        Very great.             

578
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,932
Congratulations,                
really.                         

579
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,868
        So, where's             
    the wedding happening?      

580
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,836
        In a dream?             

581
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:08,439
No, Alice.                      
In a town hall.                 

582
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:12,376
        Oh. Look, I just think  
        it's sad, all right?    

583
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,346
        Two women pretending    
        to be married.          

584
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,214
    I pretended I was married   
        for 12 years.           

585
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,716
            And I think that    
            marriage is based   

586
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,551
            On commitment       
            and communication   

587
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:23,254
        And not necessarily     
        the presence of a penis.

        they're gonna repeat it?

    gonna stand for this?

                and me know     

598

            to fit together.

 is all about?

Oh, thank god.                  
Poor grandma.                   

701
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,122
            Yeah.               

702
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,691
    She just wants to be        
    the star of the funeral.    

703
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,526
                No, she doesn't.

704
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,461
Hey, Elvis killed himself       
because someone                 

705
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,697
Was gonna write a book          
about his underwear wrestling.  

706
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,966
                    What?       

707
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,400
What are you doing?             

708
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,805
        Grandma asked me        
    to speak at the funeral.    

709
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,807
            Huh. Nobody         
            asked me to speak.  

710
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,475
    Do you want to?             

711
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:41,612
    Because I have no idea      
        what to say.            

712
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,147
Just say...                     

713
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,648
    [sighs]                     

714
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,316
He was away so much,            

715
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:48,318
It was weird                    
to have him around.             

716
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:49,820
        [pouring cereal]        

717
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:52,489
                I just want     
                to say something

718
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:55,425
                Beautiful       
                and poetic.     

719
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:58,662
Pop loved poetry.               

720
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,497
                        He did? 

721
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,666
    Yeah.                       

722
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:05,669
All the ones                    
about Nantucket.                

723
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,738
I think his favorite            
was about                       

724
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,406
A little                        
handicapped girl--              

725
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,676
There once was                  
a girl who was crippled         

726
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,512
By the weight                   
of her overgrown nipple.        

727
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,181
    Katie, voice-over:          
I needed to talk to someone     

728
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:18,816
    Who saw grandpa clearly.    

729
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:20,851
    (music) as I remember your eyes (music) 

730
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:24,688
        (music) were bluer            
    than Robin's eggs (music)         

731
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:27,357
    (music) my poetry was lousy,      
        you said (music)              

732
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:28,859
                [knock on door] 
Katie: Dad.                     

733
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,461
        (music) where are you         
        calling from? (music)         

734
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,197
            (music) a booth           
        on the midway (music)         

735
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:34,998
Dad, are you                    
in there?                       

736
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:37,701
    [knocking on door]          

737
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:43,373
        (music) 10 years ago,         
I bought you some cufflinks (music)   

738
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,375
        (music) you brought me        
        something... (music)          

739
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:47,044
    [turns down music]          

740
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,746
Dad, the door is locked,        
and I need to talk.             

741
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,281
                Katie?          

742
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,716
        Dad?                    

743
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:54,218
                Fuck!           

744
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:56,520
                Coming.         

745
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,058
    Dad.                        

746
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,126
                Coming.         

747
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:09,333
                Fuck! Fuck!     

748
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,736
                    Ah!         

749
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:13,904
    Dad.                        

750
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,242
                Coming.         
                Coming, sweetie.

751
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:22,346
                Goddamn it!     

752
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:32,322
Is that a joint?                

753
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,459
                        Ah!     

754
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:38,595
        Dad?                    

755
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,210
Yes, boys?                      

756
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:58,916
            So, uh...How's      
            that book going?    

757
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:00,717
    It's hot.                   

758
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:07,791
            Can we...Help you   
            with anything?      

759
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:12,162
        Maybe, uh...            
        Intern with you?        

760
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,569
You can rub my feet             
if you want.                    

761
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,974
Mom has that appointment        
with the parson tomorrow.       

762
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:25,475
            Yeah. Well,         
            Don't worry,        

763
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,144
            Because I'm         
            gonna spring her.   

764
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:29,146
        She was trying          
        to kill herself.        

765
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:31,315
                Yeah. It's      
                pretty common.  

766
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,250
                In fact, after  
                Scandinavians,  

767
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,818
                It's the over-70
                crowd           

768
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,820
                That is the most
                suicidal.       

769
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:39,222
Well, shouldn't we be doing     
    something to help her?      

770
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,824
            No. Mm-mmm.         

771
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,160
        Because once people     
        have their mind made up,

772
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:44,828
        There's really          
        very little             

773
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,496
        That you could do       
        to stop them.           

774
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:49,466
    There's got to be           
    something we can do.        

775
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,835
Do you remember                 
that game against Easton?       

776
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:54,338
            Oh, yeah. They were 
            a very tough team.  

777
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:56,840
No, but do you                  
remember...                     

778
00:32:56,908 --> 00:33:01,378
Naomi in the hotel              
with the oow-oow-oow?           

779
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,180
Do you remember?                

780
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:06,183
    "oh, look at how silly      
    and normal I can act        

781
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,352
        When I'm not            
    persecuting my sister."     

782
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:09,653
        [mock laughter]         

783
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,864
    So...                       

784
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:24,368
How often                       
do you smoke?                   

785
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,370
                You know...     

786
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,538
                Never           
                in the morning. 

787
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:29,873
    Dad.                        

788
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:31,708
                I know. That    
                was really lame.

789
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:33,210
                I just...       

790
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:35,712
            I Don't know what   
            I'm doing anymore.  

791
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,881
You're mourning.                

792
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,383
                    Yeah.       

793
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,851
                    What?       

794
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:42,552
You're mourning.                

795
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,554
                Yeah. Yes.      
                I think I am.   

796
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:46,056
                    Yeah.       

797
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,892
            You'd think I'd be  
            over it by now.     

798
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,294
Well, dad,                      
it just happened.               

799
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,896
                    No.         

800
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,399
                He's been dead  
                for years.      

801
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:56,900
    What?                       

802
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,902
            If I just           
            would have gotten   

803
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,904
        That stupid             
        toothpaste commercial.  

804
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,572
        That was the moment.    

805
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,074
            I swear to god.     

806
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,443
What are we                     
talking about?                  

807
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:07,911
            I was the choice    

808
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,746
            For this toothpaste 
            campaign.           

809
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,581
            I was the guy,      
            and I just...       

810
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:13,583
            I could not         
            say the line.       

811
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:15,252
            I literally...      
            I couldn't say it.  

812
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,120
            "it's the breath    
            freshiest."         

813
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,222
                I just...

00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,364
Well, I guess.                  

932
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:57,033
Well, when your grandfather     
was around, of course.          

933
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:58,535
            He kept the peace?  

934
00:38:58,602 --> 00:38:59,869
No, no, no.                     

935
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:02,272
He just kept us                 
on eggshells.                   

936
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,542
He had us all so desperate      
    for his approval.           

937
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:07,544
        Well, look              
        at your father.         

938
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:10,814
        He made a career        
            out of it.          

939
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:11,881
                    Morning.    

940
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:13,383
        Morning, Danny.         

941
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:14,718
                    Everybody   
                    sleep ok?   

942
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:15,885
            Never.              

943
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:18,788
        Danny: Hey, did we have 
        a blackout last night?  

944
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,690
That's what I heard.            

945
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,726
        We sure did. I couldn't 
        even find my room--     

946
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:23,727
                What?           

947
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:25,228
You found                       
my room all right.              

948
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,730
                It was dark.    

949
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,566
So you hid                      
in my closet?                   

950
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:31,067
                With your kids? 

951
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,736
    We were lost.               

952
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:35,238
                Hey, you guys,  
                listen to this. 

953
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,240
                Tell me         
                how it sounds.  

954
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,743
        "grandpa made us aware  
        that there is           

955
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,979
        A whole world           
    of opportunity out there."  

956
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,414
                    He did?     

957
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,082
        Who are we              
        talking about?          

958
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,250
Grandpa.                        

959
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,918
                Tell her        
                about the time  

960
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:50,620
                That dad built  
                us that swing.  

961
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,288
        That was Carl,          
        the neighbor.           

962
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:53,990
    Alice: Mr. Grabby.          

963
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,092
                Mr. Grabby      
                built the swing?

964
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,995
Mmm. Oh, he was                 
so creepy.                      

965
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,263
        He'd put his hand       
        on your shoulder        

966
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:01,598
        And announce,           
        "you're it."            

967
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:03,266
        Then he wouldn't        
            run away.           

968
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,568
        He wouldn't even        
        take his hand away.     

969
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:06,770
                    Right.      

970
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:08,438
    Um...Hi, you guys.          

971
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,440
    There was a lot             
    of paperwork,               

972
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:12,275
    And I had to pull           
    some strings                

973
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:13,943
    And sign                    
    a lot of names,             

974
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:14,944
        But she's back.         

975
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:16,613
Grandma.                        
                There she is.   

976
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,381
Hi, mother.                     

977
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:20,283
        Try it again,           
        I'll kill you myself.   

978
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,285
                        Alice.  

979
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:25,622
Well, I have to get             
back to work, so...Bye.         

980
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:27,457
                    Thanks, Sam.

981
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,459
    What happened, grandma?     

982
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:31,294
            Nothing happened.   

983
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,630
            I was just          
            a little confused.  

984
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,298
About what?                     

985
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:38,134
        I thought the vows      
        we took were forever.   

986
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:40,136
Katie: They were.               

987
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,372
It's just that                  
your forever                    

988
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,140
Was longer than                 
grandpa's forever.              

989
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,975
                Hi, everybody.  

990
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:48,311
Hi.                             
            Hey, Ryan.          

991
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,980
Hey, Ryan.                      

992
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:52,882
How are you?                    

993
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,819
            Good. Um...         

994
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:57,921
            I'm sorry about     
            your grandfather.   

995
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:02,826
Hey. You know...                

996
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:06,696
He died. Ha ha.                 

997
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:08,998
            Yeah. Um...         
            You know, it's...   

998
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:11,401
             You can't, uh...   

999
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:16,105
            You want to, like,  
            go for a walk or... 

1000
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,623
                    So...       

1001
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,026
    So...                       

1002
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:39,362
Still driving a taxi?           

1003
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,364
                Yeah. Yep.      

1004
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:44,067
            To save up money    
            for college.        

1005
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:46,035
            Are you mad at me?  

1006
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:47,370
    No.                         

1007
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:48,538
                    Really?     

1008
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:52,041
Really. I mean it.              

1009
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:53,943
You're a great kid.             

1010
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:58,581
            Um...Thanks, coach. 

1011
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:04,888
No, I just...                   
I just think that...            

1012
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:07,257
What happened                   
last Summer was--               

1013
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:08,625
                    What?       

1014
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,727
                What happened?  

1015
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:13,496
At your house.                  

1016
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:23,072
                Oh, you         
                Don't mean...   

1017
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,241
                That time when  
                you attacked me 

1018
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,910
                At the movie    
                theater,        

1019
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:28,912
            And then you came   
            over to my place    

1020
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:30,747
             And took all       
             your clothes off   

1021
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:32,749
        And then ran out without
        saying good-bye.        

1022
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:35,418
            Is that what you're 
            talking about?      

1023
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,619
                Katie.          

1024
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:37,921
                    Knock-knock.

1025
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:38,755
Who's there?                    

1026
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:39,822
                    Salmon.     

1027
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,424
Salmon who?                     

1028
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:42,659
                    Salmonella. 

1029
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,494
        What are you doing?     

1030
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,262
            Science experiment. 

1031
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,764
            How many eggs       
            does it take        

1032
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:49,632
            To make them        
            say something?      

1033
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,434
Speak,                          
young cousins.                  

1034
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:54,537
        Burt, you see           
    what's going on here?       

1035
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:56,439
                    Burt.       

1036
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:58,441
    Oh. Uh...                   

1037
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,276
        Uh...                   

1038
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:03,947
    Ha ha ha.                   

1039
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:05,448
        Uh...                   

1040
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:06,950
        [egg cracks]            

1041
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:09,252
            What has Alice done 
            to all of you?      

1042
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:14,791
                Now, this is    
                my favorite.    

1043
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:17,293
                Cherry,         
                inlaid Olive,   

1044
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:19,796
                And real brass  
                fittings.       

1045
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:21,798
                At just $32,000,

1046
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:24,133
                It's quite      
                a steal.        

1047
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:26,336
    Just $32,000?

                How much        
                does it cost

                a garbage bag?

1052
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:34,811
Mom, it's just                  
unbelievably disrespectful.

            going in the ground.

1054

What do you mean?               

1056

    to float him out            

1057

    In a flaming boat.

00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,322
                I'm not sure    
                that's legal.   

1059
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,358
        Great.

    staying for that.

                to be buried.   

1063
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,166
No. This is not                 
about you.                      

1064

    I Don't exactly get         

1066
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:03,206
    The whole cemetery          
        thing myself.           

1067
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:04,540
            A cemetery is like  

1068
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:07,210
            An old-age home     
            for the dead,       

1069

    Has to be such a production 
        with this family.       

1101
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,607
    We didn't need              
    to buy one.

We bought a box.

So it's over.                   

1106
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:54,283
        It looked more like     
        a shipping crate, but...

1107

            For the next 2 days?

1111
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:03,126
                Would that be   
                possible?       

1112
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,627
Does that include you,          

1113
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:06,629
Or are you just telling         
everybody else what to do?      

1114
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:08,131
            Look, Don't cast me 
            in the role

            an update           

1160
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:57,006
    When I get off of work.     

1161
00:47:57,074 --> 00:48:01,077
    Did she say anything        
    before she jumped?          

1162
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:04,480

1165
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:11,888

1166

1167
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:20,963
            Yeah, what ever     
            happened to Alice?  

1168
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:23,966
Yeah. Who dumped her            
in the bitch tank?              

1169
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:25,601
        [laughter]              

1170
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:30,072
She wasn't like this            
when we were kids.              

1171
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:33,142
    Judy: Wait a second.        
We're talking about Alice here? 

1172
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:37,780
Yeah. Alice was fun             
and mischievous.                

1173
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:40,783
            We're talking about 
            your sister Alice?  

1174
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:42,118
                    Yeah.       

1175
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:45,121
We had a dress code             
in high school.                 

1176
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:48,791
 We had to wear skirts,         
 blouses, little vests.         

1177
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:54,196
And Alice talked a bunch        
of girls, maybe 20,             

1178
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,866
Into protesting it,             
so they come to school,         

1179
00:48:56,934 --> 00:49:01,137
And they're wearing             
jeans and hot pants,            

1180
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:03,139
 And the headmaster             
 lost it.                       

1181
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:06,909
He suspended them,              
so the next week...             

1182
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:16,819
                    Next week?  

1183
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,487
What's next week?               

1184

1186
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:22,792
You were                        
telling a story.                

1187
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:24,627
        Yeah, you were          
        telling a story--       

1188
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,362
    Alice and the dress code.   

1189
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:31,500
Oh, god. We had                 
a dress code in high school.    

1190
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:35,237
We had to wear                  
these little uniforms--         

1191
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:36,872
            No, no.             
        We got this part.       

1192
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:40,676
With the...With blouses         
and things like this.           

1193
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:45,147
And Alice talked a bunch        
of girls, maybe 20--            

1194
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,482
        Fast-forward.           

1195
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,851
And they come                   
to school                       

1196
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:52,922
Wearing hot pants               
and jeans.                      

1197
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,857
And so the next week,           

1198
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:59,528
They come to the school         
wearing the uniform,            

1199
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:01,197
But they had crew cuts.          

1200
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:04,500

            quite a yarn.       

1202
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:09,872
    No. She was my hero.        
        I'll have some.         

1203
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,642
You've had quite                
enough, my darling.             

1204
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:25,054
    I Don't know if your        
grandparents ever told you,     

1205
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:27,656
    But I used to go up there   
        and hang out            

1206
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:29,392
    When you weren't around,    

1207
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:33,095
    Till your grandfather       
    hit me with a rock.         

1208
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:35,331
                    Yeah.       
You coming?                     

1209
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:42,071

        I was a crow.           

1210
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:45,174
            I was not           
        his favorite person.

say about him?

        people to say about you?

1213
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:59,855
What could you say              
about me?                       

1214
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:04,527
            What would I say    
            about you?          

1215
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:10,833

1278
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:55,431
            You remember        
            when your father    

1279
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:58,033
            Walked in on us     
            in the basement?    

1280
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:07,176
Were we doing this?             

1281
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:13,048
    Kind of.                    

1282
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:17,553
            Were we doing this? 

1283
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:24,560

        doing there?            

1291

1294
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:00,896

        What are you guys       
        looking at?             

1298
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:21,784

Are you leaving?

1315
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:29,485
                Where is she?   

1316
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,086
I Don't know.                   

1317
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:33,255
        She didn't leave        
        with Samantha?          

1318
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:34,590
    Morning.                    

1319
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:36,091
        Morning.                
                    Morning.    

1320
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:37,426
Where's, uh...                  

1321
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:38,927
                We Don't know.  

1322
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:40,429
Well, did she leave--           

1323
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:41,964
    Skip: No, she didn't.       

1324
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:44,099
        I saw her get out       
            of the car,         

1325
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:46,735
        And I saw her           
    go towards the woods.       

1326
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:53,175
        And then she just       
            became a...

1328
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:58,714
Katie: I'm sorry.               

1329
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:01,483
There are only 2 hours          
before the funeral,             

1330
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:03,619
And I really need               
some help here.                 

1331
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:05,320
        Skip: Are you           
    dressing up for this?       

1332
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:07,122
Hey, hey, hey,                  
you guys.                       

1333
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:10,192
Could one of you                
please tell me                  

1334
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:16,432
One nice thing I can say        
about your dead father?         

1335
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:25,741
        He often called me      
        Andrea for no reason.   

1336
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:29,311
I was Barry.                    

1337
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:30,979
                Wait a minute.  
                What about...   

1338
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:32,381
                Remember        
                thanksgiving,   

1339
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:35,484
            And that crazy lady 
            broke in the house? 

1340
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:37,486
    Yes, that woman             
    with the red hair.          

1341
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:39,521
            Yep, yep,           
            and remember.       

1342
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:41,323
            She took the leg    
            off a turkey        

1343
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:43,192
            And started banging 
            it on the table     

1344
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:45,093
        And screaming           
        something about Easter? 

1345
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:46,829
That's...Easter.                
That's right.                   

1346
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:48,530
You remember                    
how cool dad was?               

1347
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:51,166
He leapt over the table,        
swept her off her feet,         

1348
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:52,868
And carried her                 
out the front door.             

1349
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:55,204
    "he protected us."          

1350
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,006
        What else?              

1351
00:57:58,074 --> 00:58:01,343
                Why Don't you...

1352
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:04,346
                Read a passage  

1353
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:07,349
                 From <i>death</i>     
                 <i>of a salesman?</i>

1376
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:05,107
            Could we go inside  
            and talk

01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:02,157
        Except a little         
        acting maybe.           

1510
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:06,227
    That's where my Danny boy   
        got it from.            

1511
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:11,299
    There's something stuck     
    to my tongue, too.          

1512
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:16,571
Of course, Jerry was the one    
    with the film career.       

1513
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:20,375
        What I'm trying         
        to tell you is...       

1514
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:23,044
    There were 3 of you.        

1515
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:24,779
                    He always   
                    forgets me. 

1516
01:06:24,847 --> 01:06:26,915
    One in Rhode Island,        

1517
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:30,819
        One in Mexico,          
and one in South Carolina.      

1518
01:06:30,886 --> 01:06:32,220
            Ha ha ha!           

1519
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:36,057
If you think raising 3 families 
        is a lot of work,       

1520
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:38,360
        You try doing it        

1521
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:41,196
    Without letting them        
find out about each other.      

1522
01:06:41,263 --> 01:06:42,964
    Oh, that's a killer.        

1523
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:45,333
    Talk about leaking money.   

1524
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:47,936
    Ooh, when I was 20,         

1525
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:50,872
    I inherited millions,       

1526
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:56,378
        And now...I'm up        
    to my prostate in debt.     

1527
01:06:56,445 --> 01:07:00,582
        Ha ha! It was           
        a crazy life,           

1528
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:03,051
        But I loved it...       

1529
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,020
        Because I love          
    my 3 wonderful wives        

1530
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:07,455
    And my 9 Precious--         

1531
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:08,890
Lance on videotape: 11.         

1532
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:09,958
            11?                 

1533
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:13,561
        [laughing]              

1534
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:16,331
    11 children? My god.        

1535
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:18,466
    No wonder I couldn't get    
    your names straight.        

1536
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:21,503
        Anyway, I've had        
        a great life.           

1537
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:22,737
                    Mmm!        

1538
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:25,573
        A full life...          

1539
01:07:25,641 --> 01:07:27,409
        3 full lives.           

1540
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:29,411
        You should all be       
            so lucky.           

1541
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:31,946
        Katie Collins,          
    I'd like you to find        

1542
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:35,350
    My other 2 families         

1543
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:40,088
        And inform them         
        of their loss.          

1544
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:41,356
                    Mmm!        

1545
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:44,592
    Remember, I was just        
as big a part of their families 

1546
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:47,162
    As I was of yours.          

1547
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:50,632
If I've learned anything,       
it's to be true to yourself.    

1548
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:51,933
                        Look it. 

1549
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:54,602
He clocked them.                

1550
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,971
All the way                     
from the grave.                 

1551
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:00,875
    All this time, I thought    
    you were his favorite.      

1552
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:05,814
    Well, I mean, you were      
    his favorite one of us.     

1553
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:09,150
    We could have been          
his second-favorite family.     

1554
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:12,720
                I left something
                in the...       

1555
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:17,225
    We could have been          
        his third.              

1556
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:24,866
        Congratulations         
    on the thousand bucks.      

1557
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:27,469
                    Thanks.     

1558
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:38,313
What makes you think            
they know what they're doing?   

1559
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:41,049
    This is actually the kind   
    of stuff they're good at.   

1560
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:46,988
Maybe we should watch           
from over there.                

1561
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:48,423
        Yeah.                   

1562
01:08:57,733 --> 01:09:02,504
    (music) love is but a song        
        we're singing (music)         

1563
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:05,673
    (music) fear's the way we die (music)   

1564
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:07,075
    [coughs]                    

1565
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:10,345
                I never knew.   

1566
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:12,514
None of us did.                 

1567
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:14,849
            No. I mean,         
            I knew your family  

1568
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:18,019
            Was, you know...    
            A little...         

1569
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:22,023
            But I had no idea.  

1570
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:25,026
        (music) though the bird       
        is on the wing (music)        

1571
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:28,029
        (music) and you may not       
            know why (music)          

1572
01:09:28,097 --> 01:09:29,531
                You know, Sam,  
                I think         

1573
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:31,032
                I'll catch up   
                with you later. 

1574
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:32,534
                I'm gonna       
                have a word     

1575
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:34,035
                With my brother 
                there.          

1576
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:35,537
    Ok.                         

1577
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:38,039
        (music) everybody             
        get together (music)          

1578
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:42,243
    (music) try to love one another   
        right now (music)             

1579
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:44,379
Dad, a little                   
assistance.                     

1580
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:47,582
        Listen, guys...         

1581
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:51,586
    My pop never told me...     

1582
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:54,155
        He never told me...     

1583
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:57,458
        How much he--           

1584
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:58,993
                    Don't.      

1585
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:00,962
            What?               

1586
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,164
You were gonna                  
say the "l" word.               

1587
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:05,066
        I just want you         
            to know--           

1588
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:07,101
Dad, we know                    
how you feel.                   

1589
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:09,170
Don't cheapen it                
with words.                     

1590
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:12,140
    I Don't want to be          
        like him.               

1591
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,442
So leave us                     
better instructions.            

1592
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:18,346
                Now, could you  
                push?           

1593
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:21,583
        I love you guys.        

1594
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:23,084
        Dad!                    
                        Dad!    

1595
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:25,954
    I know. It felt weird,      
        but I did it.           

1596
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:28,156
    The fuse!                   

1597
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:33,261
            Oh, great.          

1598
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:36,030
No worries.                     
We came prepared.               

1599
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:43,404
            Oh, great.

[inhaling deeply]               

1601
01:10:47,176 --> 01:10:50,812
            Hey, do you remember
            Harry Barnes?       

1602
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:52,614
Don't give me crap              
about that.                     

1603
01:10:52,681 --> 01:10:54,616
I'm not in the mood.            
I Don't want to--               

1604
01:10:54,683 --> 01:10:56,484
            I'm not giving you  
            crap about it.      

1605
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:58,119
            You remember him,   
            right?              

1606
01:10:58,187 --> 01:11:00,121
How could I forget him?         
He tortured you.                

1607
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:02,457
"hey, here comes                
peanut butter boy..."           

1608
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:04,792
Or crunchy-munchy face          
or roasted-toasted...           

1609
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:07,795
            Yeah, I know.       
            I just...I wanted...

1610
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:09,130
    What?                       

1611
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:10,798
             I just wanted      
             to thank you.      

1612
01:11:10,866 --> 01:11:12,867
            I just want to      
            thank you for that. 

1613
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:17,138
            Thank you for       
            looking after us,

                You clobbered

01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:02,603
So, after it stopped            
raining grandpa,                

1738
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:05,639
I caught a ride here.           

1739
01:19:05,707 --> 01:19:07,608
                [sniffling]     

1740
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:10,111
            I'm so honored      
            and touched.        

1741
01:19:10,178 --> 01:19:12,680
        Thank you for           
        sharing that with me.   

1742
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:14,281
I'm sorry.                      

1743
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:16,183
            I had no idea.      

1744
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:19,487
            No wonder Edmund    
            was gone so often.  

1745
01:19:19,554 --> 01:19:22,556
It's hard to believe.           
It really is.                   

1746
01:19:24,693 --> 01:19:26,861
                Poor Barbara.   

1747
01:19:28,697 --> 01:19:29,997
What do you mean?               

1748
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:33,300
            I Don't know        
            what to say.        

1749
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:34,969
You're not Barbara?             

1750
01:19:35,036 --> 01:19:38,806
            Edmund was the best 
            neighbor I ever had.

1751
01:19:38,874 --> 01:19:40,808
                [crying]

1753
01:19:57,726 --> 01:19:59,660
                    How'd it go?

1754
01:19:59,728 --> 01:20:01,662
    Oh...                       

1755
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:05,666
Pretty well, I guess.           

1756
01:20:05,734 --> 01:20:07,668
                I was starting  
                to think maybe  

1757
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:09,170
                You ducked out  
                the back on me  

1758
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:10,604
                Or something.   

1759
01:20:10,672 --> 01:20:13,274
    Ha ha ha!

somebody some good somehow (music)

1765
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:39,366

that brings us to the toasts,
