1
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,993
I'll take him.

2
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,191
<i>Jimmy MacElroy. The crowd swooning</i>
<i>as he comes out of that spin flawlessly.</i>

3
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,076
<i>They are giving him the love</i>
<i>and he is giving it right back.</i>

4
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,752
<i>Here it comes.</i>

5
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,677
<i>And he nails it!</i>

6
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,192
It's the best he's been.

7
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,312
<i>Now there's the arm.</i>

8
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,159
<i>And you know what that means.</i>

9
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,352
<i>Yes. The galloping peacock.</i>
<i>And look at him getting air on that.</i>

10
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,472
<i>Flawless. Just textbook perfection.</i>

11
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,194
<i>There are very few women</i>
<i>in the history of this sport</i>

12
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,436
<i>that skate with this kind of beauty.</i>

13
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,791
Come on, Jimmy. Nail it!

14
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,278
<i>Ending the programme</i>
<i>showing his flexibility.</i>

15
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,391
<i>What a great effort!</i>

16
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,192
<i>He couldn't skate any better than that.</i>

17
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,914
<i>The performance of a lifetime,</i>
<i>Jimmy MacElroy!</i>

18
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,429
<i>Elegant with</i>
<i>machine-like technical precision.</i>

19
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,515
<i>And there it is.</i>

20
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,110
<i>So important to remember that</i>
<i>that dove was in his suit the whole time.</i>

21
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,356
<i>Jimmy's renowned</i>
<i>for his personal hygiene, Scott.</i>

22
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,080
But after that performance,
he's starting to reek of gold.

23
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,398
But after that performance,
he's starting to reek of gold.

24
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,238
<i>While the judges decide Jimmy's fate,</i>

25
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,828
<i>let's take a look</i>
<i>at this exceptional young skater.</i>

26
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,232
<i>He is a child of privilege.</i>

27
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,920
<i>A classic skater defined</i>
<i>by elegance, precision</i>

28
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,156
<i>and an ability to endure great pain.</i>

29
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,431
<i>He was plucked from an orphanage</i>
<i>at age four</i>

30
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,028
<i>by billionaire champion-maker,</i>
<i>Darren MacElroy.</i>

31
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,398
<i>Once a breeder of some of the most</i>
<i>successful racehorses in the world,</i>

32
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,635
<i>Darren had turned his attention</i>

33
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,399
<i>to nurturing athletically advanced</i>
<i>human orphans.</i>

34
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,638
<i>His ultimate find came in the form</i>
<i>of skating wunderkind, Jimmy.</i>

35
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,115
I guess I had a pretty normal childhood.

36
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,119
<i>With his father's state of the art,</i>

37
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,515
<i>some say questionable,</i>
<i>training methods,</i>

38
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,599
<i>this child prodigy</i>
<i>was forged into an über skater.</i>

39
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,553
<i>Soon, Jimmy was sweeping the gold</i>

40
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,478
<i>while his trademark Jimmy curl</i>
<i>was sweeping the nation,</i>

41
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,831
<i>with kids of all ages fashion drafting</i>
<i>right behind their idol.</i>

42
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,155
<i>A champion, an icon, a giver.</i>

43
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,990
<i>Jimmy MacElroy,</i>
<i>skating's Little Orphan Awesome.</i>

44
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,354
- Well, Coach?
- You nailed it, Jimmy. You nailed it.

45
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,994
You nailed it shut.
Every move exactly like I showed you.

46
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,553
I am so proud of you.

47
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,035
Thanks. Dad, what'd you think?

48
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,628
Decided on our own to do
a little flourish off the triple, did we?

49
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,910
Look, I knew I had it.
I just felt like it needed a little...

50
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,510
Feeling? We're feeling now?
What are you teaching this boy?

51
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,629
Jimmy!

52
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,639
I sent you a cup of my blood!
Did you get my blood? Jimmy!

53
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,591
Please don't encourage them. Come on.

54
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,709
Move!

55
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,159
They may look cute and innocent
but they're nothing

56
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,998
but a beehive for germs and bacteria.

57
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,271
- Remember the slides I showed you?
- But they're beautiful.

58
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,308
You smell like a winner!
You want to smell like...

59
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,953
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen...</i>
- Jimmy!

60
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,559
- I'll call you!
<i>...the judges' scores are:</i>

61
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,515
<i>5.9, 5.9, 6.0,</i>

62
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,758
<i>5.9, 6.0, 5.8.</i>

63
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,440
All right, not bad, not bad.
As long as that 5.8 doesn't kill us.

64
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,754
Hands.

65
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,668
Skittles.

66
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,558
Hey, MacElroy. Was that your routine?

67
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,353
Or a performance
of Cirque du So-lame?

68
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,435
Besides, you're too late.

69
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,152
They already handed out
the girls' medals this morning.

70
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,269
Shut up, Michaels.

71
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,949
That was textbook execution.
Same scores I beat you with in Oslo.

72
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,548
I was on Quaaludes.
I don't even remember Oslo.

73
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,999
But I remember Boston,

74
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,031
and that victory was
as sweet as the cream pie

75
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,593
for which the town was named.

76
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,950
Step aside, home school.
There's a new sheriff in town.

77
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,835
Chazz!

78
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,949
<i>There he is. Skating's outlaw,</i>
<i>Chazz Michael Michaels.</i>

79
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,150
<i>This cowboy is cracking his whip on the</i>
<i>haunch of this crowd, and they love it!</i>

80
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,993
<i>How do you describe</i>
<i>something like that?</i>

81
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:24,474
<i>He just uses everything at his disposal.</i>
<i>The movement, the music.</i>

82
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,194
<i>And he just nails the triple Axel!</i>

83
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,756
<i>Surfing a tsunami of swagger right now.</i>

84
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,519
<i>Well, you know he is sex on ice.</i>

85
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,839
<i>Hello, ladies. Typical of Michaels,</i>
<i>it's not enough just to win.</i>

86
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,428
<i>He wants to make love to the crowd.</i>

87
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,432
<i>That's why those seats are so valuable.</i>

88
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,313
<i>That's what they want</i>
<i>from Chazz Michael Michaels.</i>

89
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,597
<i>Michaels just slipped MacElroy</i>
<i>a very public note.</i>

90
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,995
<i>You have been called out, sir.</i>

91
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,399
You're welcome, Stockholm.

92
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,909
<i>Unreal. An instant classic.</i>

93
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,792
<i>Just when you think you've seen it all,</i>

94
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,230
<i>Chazz Michael Michaels walks in</i>
<i>with the unrated version.</i>

95
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,477
<i>The undefeatable underdog,</i>
<i>ice skating's backdoor lover,</i>

96
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,592
<i>Chazz Michael Michaels has come</i>
<i>in here and captivated this arena</i>

97
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,836
like a stack of classic Euro porn.

98
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,791
<i>And so while his scores</i>
<i>are being tabulated,</i>

99
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,515
<i>let's learn a little bit more</i>
<i>about skating's Leather-clad Lothario.</i>

100
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,399
<i>Chazz Michael Michaels,</i>
<i>an ice-devouring sex tornado.</i>

101
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,636
<i>Spawned in the hell-fires of Motown.</i>

102
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,795
<i>Troubled childhood?</i>

103
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,874
If you call being a nine-year-old kid
with a 35-year-old girlfriend troubled.

104
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,675
<i>At age 12, Chazz escaped a life of</i>
<i>running cigarettes and illegal fireworks</i>

105
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,998
<i>by becoming a star in Detroit's</i>
<i>underground sewer skating scene.</i>

106
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,835
<i>The only skater to win four national</i>
<i>championships and an adult film award,</i>

107
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,078
<i>which is not to say this rough-hewn</i>
<i>heartthrob doesn't have a softer side.</i>

108
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,715
<i>He recently published a book of poetry,</i>
Let Me Put My Poems in You.

109
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,150
Before a big competition,
I like to work with leather.

110
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,350
The Native Americans always said

111
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,233
that working with hides and pelts
releases the soul.

112
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,715
These are a couple of diaper bags
I made for Faith Hill.

113
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,632
<i>Two men, only one winner.</i>

114
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,990
<i>Will it be Chazz Michael Michaels?</i>

115
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,793
Personal philosophy: Clothing optional.

116
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,198
Hope you brought your silver polish,
MacElroy, 'cause that was gold.

117
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,639
That was disgusting.

118
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,671
That, young man,
is how babies are made.

119
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,995
- Get out of my face.
- I'll get inside your face.

120
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,109
Mr Michael Michaels,

121
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,037
please gather your coach,
family, and friends

122
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,957
and move to the bench
to await your scores.

123
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,038
Hey, traffic cop. Get this straight.
I don't have a coach. I don't need one.

124
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,948
And as for friends and family,
Chazz Michael Michaels walks alone.

125
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,550
That's why they call me the Lone Wolf,
on my back there.

126
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,231
<i>5.9, 5.9, 6.0...</i>

127
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,509
That's what I'm talking about.

128
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,154
<i>5.9, 6.0...</i>

129
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,759
Another 6.0.

130
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,995
<i>... 5.8.</i>

131
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,519
Was it good for you, Stockholm?

132
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,200
'Cause it was good for me.
Let's have a smoke.

133
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,675
Eat that, MacElroy.

134
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,519
Those were the same scores
I got, Einstein. We're tied.

135
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,552
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen, we have a tie.</i>
- You're high.

136
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,750
<i>From the United States,</i>
<i>Jimmy MacElroy</i>

137
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,678
<i>and Chazz Michael Michaels.</i>

138
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,319
You're fired.

139
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,317
What? I brought you a gold medal.

140
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,873
No, you brought me half a gold medal.

141
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,595
If I wanted him to share,
I'd have bought him a brother.

142
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,190
<i>It's raining men in the men's singles.</i>
<i>Men wearing gold, that is.</i>

143
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,471
<i>And they join Team USA's</i>
<i>other gold medallists,</i>

144
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,478
<i>the pairs team of</i>
<i>Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg.</i>

145
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,274
<i>Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg,</i>

146
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,073
<i>America's brother and sister darlings,</i>

147
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,158
<i>the gold standard</i>
<i>of pairs figure skating.</i>

148
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,909
<i>Children of</i>
<i>beloved Swiss skiing gold medallists,</i>

149
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,758
<i>Otto and Ella Van Waldenberg,</i>

150
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,510
<i>the twin dynamos Stranz and Fairchild</i>
<i>burst out of the womb and onto the ice</i>

151
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,393
<i>while their sister, Katie,</i>
<i>cheered from the sidelines.</i>

152
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:21,355
<i>Theirs seemed to be a charmed life</i>
<i>until March 14th, 1987</i>

153
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,633
<i>when their parents died tragically</i>
<i>in a car crash.</i>

154
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,353
<i>Katie would survive.</i>

155
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,517
<i>The world wondered, had Stranz</i>
<i>and Fairchild gone into a layback spin</i>

156
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,437
<i>from which they could never recover?</i>

157
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,993
<i>But the siblings' commitment was such</i>

158
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,237
<i>that they were back in the training rink</i>
<i>within hours of the funeral.</i>

159
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,352
<i>So tonight, the crowd cheers</i>
<i>on their beloved Van Waldenbergs.</i>

160
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,913
<i>Well, Stranz and Fairchild,</i>

161
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,031
<i>how heavy is that gold</i>
<i>around your necks?</i>

162
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,869
Scott, this may be solid gold
but to us it's lighter than air

163
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,831
because dreams never weigh you down.

164
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,757
No. Dreams are in your sleep.

165
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,633
<i>What about the amazing</i>
<i>Michaels and MacElroy?</i>

166
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,193
<i>Two gold medals?</i>

167
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,073
Yeah. That's great.

168
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,349
<i>Well, speaking of gold medals,</i>

169
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,515
<i>the winners of the men's singles</i>

170
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,677
<i>are taking their place</i>
<i>at the podium right now.</i>

171
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,479
<i>This has to be a proud moment</i>
<i>for Michaels and MacElroy.</i>

172
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,114
<i>You have to think, the only thing</i>
<i>sweeter than winning a gold medal</i>

173
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,356
<i>is sharing it</i>
<i>with your fellow countryman.</i>

174
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,469
Gosh, I'm getting sick.

175
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,158
You smell like
aftershave and taco meat.

176
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,794
Yes, I do. Now scoot over.

177
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,040
Don't touch me. Nobody touches me.

178
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,593
- Just scoot over, man.
- Don't.

179
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,994
- Just scoot over.
- You scoot over.

180
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,792
<i>Now there's some jostling</i>
<i>atop the podium</i>

181
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,388
<i>and down goes</i>
<i>Chazz Michael Michaels.</i>

182
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,956
<i>MacElroy still waving to the crowd.</i>

183
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,237
<i>Look, MacElroy's also down now.</i>

184
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,396
<i>I have never in all my years</i>
<i>seen anything</i>

185
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,272
<i>this disgraceful on the world stage.</i>

186
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,868
<i>I am stunned silent,</i>
<i>absolutely silent, Jim.</i>

187
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,434
You get that damned bird out of my face
before I break its neck.

188
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,790
<i>A perfect head butt!</i>
<i>Down goes MacElroy!</i>

189
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,717
<i>And Spaetzle's aflame!</i>

190
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,795
<i>Spaetzle! Oh, my God!</i>

191
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,433
<i>As we prepare to hear testimony,</i>
<i>Michaels and MacElroy</i>

192
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,916
<i>will be given a chance</i>
<i>to defend their actions at Stockholm...</i>

193
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,638
We love you, Jimmy.

194
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,754
Hey. Nancy Kerrigan.

195
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,919
You an official here?

196
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,918
'Cause you have officially given me
a boner.

197
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,597
I'm a sex addict. It's my cross to bear.

198
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,794
It's a real disease with doctors
and medicine and everything.

199
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,278
Let's get started, shall we?

200
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,277
If either one of you would like
to make a statement

201
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,789
before the commission
passes judgement,

202
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,990
you may do so at this time.

203
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,515
Fans, friends, esteemed members
of the committee,

204
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,559
I don't know what I can say,

205
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,837
but I pray you can all forgive me.

206
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,393
More than that,
I pray the children can forgive me.

207
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,555
Oh, my God.

208
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,240
- I place my future in their tiny hands.
- That is retarded.

209
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,148
God bless you. God bless everyone.
Thank you.

210
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,874
God bless you, Jimmy.
God bless your heart.

211
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,275
<i>Maxim.</i>

212
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,229
Last issue.

213
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,838
"Chazz Michael Michaels
is figure skating."

214
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,435
Boom!

215
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,036
All right, duly noted.

216
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,631
In accordance with the rules of
the International Skating Federation,

217
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,435
James MacElroy
and Charles Michael Michaels,

218
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,676
you are to be stripped of your medals...

219
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,789
What?

220
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,708
...and banned from men's figure skating
for the remainder of your lives!

221
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,876
Hey, you listen to me, old man!

222
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,949
Oh, that sucks.

223
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,513
Look what you did to my ex-wife!

224
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,517
I'm gonna pop you
in the back of the head.

225
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,154
Banned for life. That's a long time.

226
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,710
Jimmy, it'll all work out.

227
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,875
It's time for a fresh start.

228
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,833
- Yeah, a fresh start. Exactly.
- Good. Jimmy,

229
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,639
- I'm un-adopting you.
- What?

230
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,193
I don't think un-adopting
is the right word.

231
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,550
Legally, I'm disowning you.

232
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,718
But it amounts to the same thing, so...

233
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,831
But I've been your son for 26 years.

234
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,793
Twenty-two, so nobody can say
I didn't try. We've had a good run.

235
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,152
Now, I think it would be best for all of us
if we didn't drag this out. Clean break.

236
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,080
It would make it easier for me, Jimmy,
if you left now.

237
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,189
Wait!

238
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,313
It's like a Band-Aid. Just rip it off.
We'll both feel better.

239
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,199
<i>Hey, everybody,</i>
<i>get your tickets for the second show.</i>

240
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,111
<i>Second show tickets now available.</i>

241
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,394
<i>Tra-la-la-la, tra-la-la-la</i>
<i>We sing a grublet song</i>

242
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:34,436
<i>We love to roam our woodsy home</i>
<i>Of greenery and scenery and song</i>

243
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,997
<i>Tra-la-la-la, tra-la-la-la</i>
<i>A grublet sings along</i>

244
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,473
Oh, God.

245
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,433
I hate you.

246
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,279
I hate my life.

247
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,516
Oh, no! It's the evil wizard!

248
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,349
Boo!

249
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,869
I mean, I had it with skating
for the judges, you know?

250
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,831
Just like, I don't need that.

251
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,317
I mean, for me, it's so much
more satisfying to see the...

252
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,750
The eyes of a small child,
seeing that wonder as they...

253
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,350
They see you skate out there
with a big wizard head on, you know?

254
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,152
Nice. Really nice.

255
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,358
Hey, Sammy, it's not what it looks like.

256
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,029
Sam. Sammy, come on, baby.

257
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,151
You knew this was how I rolled
when you met me.

258
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,714
No. When I met you,
you were a great figure skater.

259
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,831
Now you're getting stoned
with the Woodland Fairies.

260
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,279
I don't even know
who you are any more.

261
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,753
You're living in the past, Sammy.

262
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,074
Come on,
me and the Woodland Fairies,

263
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,952
we're living in the here and now.

264
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,548
And we're feeling so free.
Come on, join us.

265
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,356
Baby. Come on, babe.

266
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,916
Hey, Michaels, let's go. Lace up.
The fog machines are primed.

267
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,395
Second show's
almost three-quarters full.

268
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,757
- You drunk?
- No.

269
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,356
But this ought to do it.

270
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,118
I would fire you

271
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,560
if you weren't so goddamn beautiful
out there.

272
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,750
- You smell like urine.
- A lot?

273
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,998
Get your head on.

274
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,278
They don't feel right.

275
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,833
That's because I'm not finished.

276
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,475
You see, it helps to think of the laces
as belonging to three distinct groups.

277
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,113
First, the foundation.

278
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,828
They're too tight.

279
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,190
Daddy! He's crushing me.

280
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,515
Doing it right takes a little bit longer,
but it's worth it.

281
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,712
Hey, what are you doing?
She said it's too tight.

282
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,319
Well, but she's wrong.

283
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,479
I mean, who are you gonna trust,
a little girl or Jimmy MacElroy?

284
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,750
- Who the hell is Jimmy MacElroy?
- Is there a problem here, sir?

285
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,155
Yeah, this kid is torturing
my daughter's foot.

286
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,349
I'm so sorry, sir.

287
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,678
You know what, Jimmy? Off the skates,
you're on stockroom duty, now. Let's go.

288
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,553
Hey, Jimmy.

289
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,354
Hector?

290
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,629
What are you doing here?

291
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,433
You know
I have a restraining order against you.

292
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,719
Oh, that thing?

293
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,709
You look great, Jimmy.
You look amazing. Your hair rocks.

294
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,829
Thanks.

295
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,315
You look so good. Oh, my gosh.

296
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,551
Do you look at yourself?

297
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,276
I totally wanna cut off your skin and
wear it to my birthday. It's coming up.

298
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,518
Yeah, listen, it's great to see you,
Hector, but I'm really busy right now.

299
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,870
Okay, all right, I'm sorry.
I'll cut to the chase.

300
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,150
- You gotta start skating again, Jimmy.
- What?

301
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,794
It's embarrassing stalking a has-been,
you know what I mean?

302
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,558
Look, I almost gave up on you.

303
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,033
I started working
with that Ukrainian skater,

304
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,639
you know the one that looks like Elvis?

305
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,954
And I moved to the Ukraine

306
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,152
and it was cold and everyone had guns
and smelled like soup.

307
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,239
I sympathise with you, Hector.
I really do, but there's nothing I can do.

308
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,475
I'm banned for life.

309
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,238
Don't be so sure.

310
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,398
Section 14, paragraph G,

311
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,149
"A lifetime ban is irrevocable
and the banned skater can never again

312
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,635
"compete in any
Federation-sanctioned tournament

313
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,354
"that exists in such a skater's division."

314
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,791
You see? You're only banned
from your division, men's singles!

315
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,397
You can still compete in pairs skating.

316
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,999
Pairs.

317
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,593
How is this possible?

318
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,917
I had so many lawyers work on
so many appeals.

319
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,600
Because nobody can obsess like I can.

320
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,232
Good luck, Jimmy.

321
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,994
And I'm still gonna kill you someday.

322
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,312
Oh, no! It's the evil wizard!

323
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,468
<i>Hey, little forest creatures.</i>

324
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,275
<i>None of you sons-of-bitches</i>
<i>try to be heroes. You hear me?</i>

325
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,268
Hey, Chazz. Come on.

326
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,078
It's Gary. What are you doing?

327
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,714
<i>Hey, everyone!</i>
<i>This is Gary, the squirrel.</i>

328
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,876
<i>Now listen up.</i>
<i>Gary's been a long-time friend.</i>

329
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,753
<i>We've been skating</i>
<i>for two and a half years.</i>

330
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,589
<i>I remember when we were hanging out</i>
<i>at the bus stop in Tucson,</i>

331
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,995
<i>and Gary said, "I've got a third ball."</i>

332
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,717
<i>Damn it. I just threw up in here, people.</i>

333
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,991
<i>That's the reality.</i>
<i>Another layer to the legend.</i>

334
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,636
<i>I am nothing but a human onion.</i>
<i>In fact, we all are. Oh, encore.</i>

335
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,669
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i> Grublets on Ice
<i>will be cancelled until further notice.</i>

336
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,756
<i>No refunds will be given.</i>

337
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,909
Bring it on! Let it rain down on me.

338
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,472
There's a loophole. I was banned
from men's singles but not pairs.

339
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,397
I can skate
in the Wintersport Games again.

340
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,353
I knew it. I knew after three years,
you just weren't checking in.

341
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,755
I mean, come on, I moved on, Jimmy.
You gotta move on, too.

342
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,791
But I'm a skater.
There's nothing to move on to,

343
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,593
except for winning the gold again
and keeping it this time.

344
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,870
You know how hard it is
to find a partner?

345
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,195
Even if you did,
you gotta qualify for Nationals.

346
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,719
That's a month away.

347
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,353
I mean, sign-up is in two days.

348
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,833
It can't be that hard. I mean...

349
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,636
Figure skating. Give it up, Jimmy.
It's like a cruel bitch mother.

350
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,073
She'll seduce you
with chocolates and roses

351
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,556
and then kick you to the side of the road
like a dead raccoon.

352
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,197
Forget it. I gotta go.

353
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,552
It's good to see you.

354
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,558
Wait, Coach!

355
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,959
Jimmy MacElroy?

356
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,557
Another great walking through the halls
of the Grublets.

357
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,150
Welcome to my little production.

358
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,669
If you're here to thank me for firing
Chazz Michaels, it was my pleasure.

359
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,789
Chazz was here?

360
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,038
Yeah, unfortunately,
but it's fantastic that you're here.

361
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,436
And yes, no need to ask,
I'll consider you for a position.

362
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,198
I'm not looking for a job.

363
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,517
I'm actually looking for a female skater
to compete with me at Nationals.

364
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,029
- Are you trying to skater poach?
- No.

365
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,037
You trying to break up my family?

366
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,357
Why don't you get out of here
before I throw down?

367
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,359
Hey, where you going?

368
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,075
Michaels.

369
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,994
MacElroy.

370
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,235
I see you got fat.

371
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,191
I see you still look
like a 15-year-old girl but not hot.

372
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,309
You crushed my dreams.

373
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,078
Dreams? Shit.
I haven't had one of those in years.

374
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,634
Zip it, Chazz. Zip it or I will punch you
in your crap lousy face.

375
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,875
This ends tonight.

376
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,956
It's daytime, you douche.

377
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,236
- Now it's on!
- You're so fat!

378
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,639
<i>Local figure skating fans got more than</i>
<i>they bargained for today</i>

379
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,593
<i>when a children's ice show</i>
<i>was interrupted by a street fight</i>

380
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,711
<i>between two former champions.</i>

381
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,910
<i>Jimmy MacElroy</i>
<i>and Chazz Michael Michaels,</i>

382
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,632
<i>once at the top of the skating world,</i>

383
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,036
<i>picked up today where they left off</i>
<i>more than three years...</i>

384
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,908
<i>Fans remember Michaels and MacElroy</i>
<i>as gold medallists who,</i>

385
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,519
<i>in a bizarre turn of events,</i>

386
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,915
<i>became banned from competition</i>
<i>for life.</i>

387
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,268
<i>I had a chance to sit down</i>
<i>with Michaels</i>

388
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,231
<i>and let's just say, he's a complex man.</i>

389
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,193
<i>I'm a sex addict</i>
<i>and I'm attracted to women.</i>

390
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,799
Two men skating together?
That's a riot. That's a laugh riot.

391
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,117
- I don't see what's so funny.
- Lf you were as drunk as me, you would.

392
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,869
Look, Coach, I know I said
I wanted to skate pairs, but two men?

393
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,991
Even if we wanted to,
they'd never allow it.

394
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,156
But there's nothing in the rule book
that says you can't.

395
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:46,034
That's not my style.
Chazz Michael Michaels goes it alone.

396
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,391
Okay?
That means no coach and no partner.

397
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,516
Especially not a dude.

398
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,313
Especially not the precious
and pampered Richie Rich.

399
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,396
Would you just shut up? You don't know
what you're talking about.

400
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,475
I know more than you think I know.

401
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,113
Hell, I know more than you know
you know.

402
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,549
No, you don't. You could never keep up
with my flawless technique.

403
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,875
That's why I floored you in '02
and the spring of '99.

404
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,433
Technique doesn't get you 18 medals

405
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,551
and a Kristi Yamaguchi
Lifetime Achievement Award.

406
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,955
- I am figure skating.
- Stop it!

407
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,517
For three years I've been trying to get
over the nightmare you two created.

408
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,471
I wasn't sure I'd ever forget it.

409
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,355
Now maybe underneath all your bullshit,
we can still find something beautiful.

410
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,234
I don't know, Coach.

411
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,271
I mean, I'm really desperate
to win that gold, but...

412
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,392
But what?
How's the partner search coming, kid?

413
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,878
What's so funny, Cool Whip?

414
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,072
You getting a lot of satisfaction
from those $15 hookers?

415
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,431
I am never satisfied. It's a curse.

416
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,955
The registration for the National Finals
closes in exactly 12 hours.

417
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,514
Now let me ask you boys a question.

418
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,156
Do you wanna make history?

419
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,153
No way.
This guy could not hold my jock sweat.

420
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,679
I could hold it all day long. Try me.

421
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,994
- Maybe I will.
- Maybe you should.

422
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,155
You challenging me, Princess?

423
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,840
I'm not inviting you to the Skating
Federation's Annual Christmas Party.

424
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,075
- Then bring it on!
- It is on!

425
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,713
Good. We're in agreement then.

426
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,829
- What?
- What?

427
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,554
Welcome back to competitive skating,
gentlemen.

428
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,509
I'll pick you up in the morning.

429
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,633
Little help.

430
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,480
Here we go. Show time.

431
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,468
Stranz. Fairchild. Melissa Kelly, ESPN2.

432
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,830
So, let me ask you,
any thoughts on the competition?

433
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,552
And what does a new gold medal
mean for you?

434
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,477
It doesn't mean as much
as winning America's hearts.

435
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,999
That's very important to us.

436
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,678
Now we haven't seen you
in about three and a half years.

437
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,835
What have you been up to?

438
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,075
Skating.

439
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,271
<i>Now apparently you're dedicating</i>
<i>this performance</i>

440
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,630
<i>to the children of the world.</i>

441
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,194
Sorry.

442
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,275
- Chazz, fill this out.
- No.

443
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,799
Yes.

444
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,194
I'll get yours, Jimmy.

445
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,594
Who is that girl?

446
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,199
You mean Katie Van Waldenberg?

447
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,151
She's Stranz and Fairchild's sister?

448
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,714
Fairchild's legs and Stranz's ass.

449
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,591
Mind bottling, isn't it?

450
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,474
- Did you just say "mind bottling?"
- Yeah, mind bottling.

451
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,589
You know, when things are so crazy,

452
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,676
it gets your thoughts all trapped,
like in a bottle.

453
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,951
All right, boys.
Let's go do this. Loud and proud.

454
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,754
What are you two doing here?

455
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,236
You know damn well I'm not letting
either of you sign up. They're banned.

456
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,555
I'm not here to sign up
Michaels or MacElroy.

457
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,400
I'm here to sign up the pairs team
of Michaels and MacElroy.

458
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,037
I'm here to sign up the pairs team
of Michaels and MacElroy.

459
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,434
Thank you.

460
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,269
Now there's your front page headline.

461
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,709
Jimmy, can you wave to the fans?

462
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,197
So Jimmy and Chazz together
and no fighting, huh?

463
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,793
Two men skating together
and in our division, no less.

464
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,319
Why, Stranz?

465
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,192
Why is God singling us out

466
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,515
for the greatest suffering
the world has ever known?

467
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,791
I don't know, sis. Those two are nothing
but a couple of freaks.

468
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,353
Yeah, and the media loves freaks.

469
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,708
Makes my blood boil.

470
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,673
And all they're doing is just leeching
the dignity out of our beloved sport.

471
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,949
You know, I'm not a violent person,

472
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,390
but I would like to hold them down
and skate over their throats.

473
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,193
Guys, maybe,
maybe if you concentrate on the skating

474
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,639
people will forget all the hype

475
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,479
and they'll focus
on the purity of the sport

476
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,160
and the spirit of honest competition.

477
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,273
You guys just want to cheat again,
don't you?

478
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,753
- That's a good idea.
- Much better.

479
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,269
Katie, please,
will you just take this camcorder, okay?

480
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,789
I don't know how to turn it on.
Thank you.

481
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,239
No, I'm not spying for you again.

482
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,079
We're just asking you
to discreetly tape their practice routines.

483
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,838
Find someone else.

484
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,479
- What's that, Mother?
- Don't.

485
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,716
You and Father are sad
that you were killed

486
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,638
driving Katie to her ice skating lesson
all those years ago?

487
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,988
Yeah. Me, too.

488
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,680
Remember how they used to be alive?

489
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,869
Papa?

490
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,512
I can't hear you, Papa.
What are you... You're crying?

491
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,712
Still? In heaven? You're still dead?

492
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,555
- Fine, I'll do it.
- Yes.

493
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,478
Now you're playing
for team Van Waldenberg.

494
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,797
All right.
You'll be staying here for the duration.

495
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,916
You're gonna skate as a pair.
You'll live as a pair.

496
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,789
And if you're at all interested
in self-preservation,

497
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,549
you take off your shoes
before you set foot on the Berber.

498
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,437
Why would we step in baby food?

499
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,472
- He's talking about the carpet. Berber?
- What are you? The Rug Doctor?

500
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,591
- Maybe I am.
- I'm the rug master.

501
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,190
- What does that even mean?
- Shut up and take off your damn shoes.

502
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,154
- Bunk beds?
- I don't share rooms.

503
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,273
I don't share shit.
The night is a very dark time for me.

504
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,632
It's dark for everyone, moron.

505
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,990
Not for Alaskans or dudes
with night vision goggles.

506
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,917
All right, this is gonna stop right now.

507
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,918
From here on out, you guys are a team.
Do you understand?

508
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,473
You are going to eat together,
sleep together.

509
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,874
You are going to pee together.

510
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,389
You're gonna file
a joint income tax return.

511
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,512
Practice starts now. End of discussion.

512
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,277
I just put those into order.

513
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,311
I need some counter space, too.

514
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,550
- Mane n' Tail. Is this horse shampoo?
- Yes, it is.

515
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,194
- Do you use this stuff on your hair?
- Uh-huh.

516
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,874
"For a lustrous coat."
Does this actually work?

517
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,319
You bet your ass it does.

518
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,910
It makes my hair shine like Orion's belt
out on the ice.

519
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,390
And then I brush my hair
100 times with this.

520
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,229
Cool brush.

521
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,397
Not just a brush but a Verticoli.

522
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,550
Handmade in Italy.
They carve it out of illegal whalebone.

523
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,750
They only make 11 of them a year.

524
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,919
This one cost me $12,000
or 30 million lira.

525
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,715
Perfectly balanced, low drag,
minimal torque.

526
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,432
How minimal?

527
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,471
I bet you'd like to know.

528
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,879
Help yourself to the Mane n' Tail
all you want,

529
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,195
but don't even look at the Verticoli.

530
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,436
'Cause I will knock your block off.

531
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,879
No exaggeration,

532
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,709
I could not love a human baby
as much as I love this brush.

533
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,835
I call top.

534
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,839
- Sorry, I already called it in my head.
- You can't do that. That doesn't count.

535
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,758
Yes, it does. Get used to it, Jimmy.

536
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,076
You're in Chazz's world now.

537
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,632
You know what?
I permanently called shotgun.

538
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,876
You do not get shotgun every time.

539
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,709
What is this place? It smells like fish.

540
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,034
Sweet.

541
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,468
This ice has not been
properly Zambonied.

542
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,750
- And where's the warm-down room?
- We don't have any of that.

543
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,472
What we got is a cold storage unit

544
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,353
that a buddy of mine let me flood
with a garden hose.

545
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,152
Nice choice, Coach.

546
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,438
Turned out well.

547
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,632
The dance lift, the press lift,
the twist lift,

548
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,958
the side by side jump, the throw jump.

549
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,594
All of these are weapons
in the pairs skaters' arsenal.

550
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,029
And used properly,
they can slay your opponent.

551
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,470
Used improperly,
you can break every bone in your body.

552
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,999
All right, gentlemen, waltz position.

553
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,078
You know what, dude,
your hand has to be on top.

554
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,599
No way. The girl's goes on top.

555
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,392
Yeah. Ergo. Chick.

556
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,748
I'm not the girl. I'm stronger.

557
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,393
No, I'm stronger
and don't have a vagina.

558
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,590
You are not stronger.
Watch this, fat ass.

559
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,709
Fat ass?

560
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,558
It doesn't really matter,
it's waltz position.

561
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,398
One guy, you put your, just...

562
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,750
See that?
It's pure pec, bicep, and tricep.

563
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,869
Jimmy, get off your hands.

564
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,036
You're gonna need those later.
Now, come on.

565
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,229
All right.

566
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,277
Okay, you know what?
I can do something cool, too.

567
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,435
Chazz. Chazz.

568
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,519
You think you're so tough. Huh?
I'm not fat. I can do this.

569
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,359
- Chazz, put your skates back on.
- No, it's too late. They're off.

570
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,710
- Look, I'm like lightning.
- Put your skates back on.

571
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,909
What are you doing?

572
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,395
- Yeah. God, that burns.
- Oh, yeah?

573
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,510
Jimmy, you put your clothes on. Jimmy!

574
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,312
- Damn it!
- Watch my Icy Hot Super Slide.

575
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,429
- Do it.
- I will.

576
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,757
It's not gonna matter
'cause you're flat in front like Ken.

577
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,509
You're the girl.

578
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,517
- What?
- You're my pretty lady, MacElroy.

579
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,949
- Wait. Why?
- Because you whine like one!

580
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,550
And no one can lift your fat ass.
You're on a diet, starting now.

581
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,399
- What are you talking about?
- Let's go! Come on!

582
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,476
Is this about my muscular, thick thighs?

583
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,990
Could one of you all pass me a biscuit?

584
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,953
You got another five miles,
then you get a LUNA bar.

585
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,399
Come on.

586
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,158
So, Coach, I was thinking
about the music for our routine.

587
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,679
- Really?
- We're gonna skate to one song,

588
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,758
one song only.
<i>Lady Hump</i> by the Black Eyed Peas.

589
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,997
<i>What you gonna do with all that junk</i>
<i>All that junk inside my trunk</i>

590
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,237
<i>I'm gonna get you, get you drunk</i>
<i>Get you drunk off my lady hump</i>

591
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,432
<i>My hump, my hump</i>
<i>My lovely lady hump</i>

592
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,472
I'm not skating to anything
with references to lady humps.

593
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,669
I don't even know what that means.

594
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,519
No one knows what it means,
but it's provocative.

595
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,392
- No, it's not. It's gross.
- It gets the people going.

596
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,035
That's enough!
Why do you guys keep doing that?

597
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,951
You didn't see shit!

598
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,398
- Coach!
- Shut up!

599
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,877
Throw me some chicken!

600
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,159
Two men.

601
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,236
Together. You're really gonna go
through with this, huh?

602
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,634
Oh, yeah, of course. Why not?

603
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,318
I mean, I need your help.
What do you say?

604
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,318
Look, I'm just a choreographer.
What do I know?

605
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,953
Bring them
by the dance studio tomorrow.

606
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,672
- Great!
- I'm not a magician.

607
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,789
I ain't making no promises.

608
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,115
I'm just saying
that I'm'a do what I can do.

609
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,198
Your problem is your boundaries.
That ends today.

610
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,548
Out on my dance floor you won't know

611
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,636
where one man's body ends
and another begins.

612
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,354
Because if you can't dance with a man,
you damn sure can't skate with a man.

613
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,436
All right? So come on, let's go.

614
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,915
Jimmy.

615
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,829
Yeah.

616
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,760
That's what I thought.

617
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,677
That a boy, Jimmy. Come on.

618
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,549
Okay. Break it down.
Show me what you got.

619
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,509
Okay. That's a start. That is a start.

620
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,559
You're tensing your face.
If you tense your face,

621
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,352
you're gonna make it harder
for yourselves.

622
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,038
Just enable...

623
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,273
Rewind it.
I wanna see his head bang down again.

624
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,076
No. No, no.
You act right or you leave my studio.

625
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,795
Beautiful butterfly into a prayer.
Nice into...

626
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,351
Let them get it out. Let them get it out.

627
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,950
Chazz, release to Jimmy.
Easy, see? Release...

628
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,432
- Yes.
- No. No.

629
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,795
You nailed it!

630
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,754
Yes, I did. See that? Pure power.
You could use a nickel's worth, junior.

631
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,359
Maybe if you released me
at that quarter-turn,

632
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,232
I wouldn't have to save your ass
with my landing.

633
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,591
It's called improvisation.
Even your precious Kenny G does it.

634
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,711
Well, at least they're getting
the moves down.

635
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:24,118
Yeah, but can they do it in front of
five judges and 30 million people?

636
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,995
<i>Denver, Colorado, last stop on the road</i>

637
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,475
<i>to the World Wintersport Games</i>
<i>in Montreal.</i>

638
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,319
<i>The finest skaters from all over</i>
<i>the country have trained tirelessly,</i>

639
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,193
<i>for years for their chance</i>

640
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,470
<i>But all those stories</i>
<i>have been eclipsed now</i>

641
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,068
<i>by what many dub</i>
<i>the Sideshow of the Century.</i>

642
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,949
<i>The male-male pair of Jimmy MacElroy</i>
<i>and Chazz Michael Michaels.</i>

643
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,719
<i>The anxiety was palpable</i>
<i>when they arrived this morning</i>

644
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,957
<i>as the skating community</i>
<i>continued to voice its outrage.</i>

645
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,196
Those two are turning this sport
into a freak show.

646
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,595
As if figure skating
wasn't gay enough already.

647
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,430
Let me show you something.
Does that look right to you?

648
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,711
Nothing in here about two men skating.

649
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,395
That blonde chick's a dude? Oh, man.

650
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,394
<i>Now let's join Stranz</i>
<i>and Fairchild Van Waldenberg</i>

651
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,078
<i>as they wind up their routine,</i>

652
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,239

653
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,552

<i>They are really having fun with this.</i>

654
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,753

656
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,034

658

00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,637
<i>And those good vibrations seem</i>

660
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,718
<i>to have spread all the way</i>
<i>through this arena.</i>

661
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,359
What, what!

662
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,798
You guys are up.

663
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,516
<i>And now the moment</i>
<i>this crowd has been waiting for.</i>

664
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,551
<i>And how is this going to work?</i>

665
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,150
<i>Completely different skaters,</i>
<i>known to be enemies of one another,</i>

666
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,990
<i>combining to be the first male-male</i>
<i>pair team in the history of the sport.</i>

667
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,237
<i>Either the locked-in technical style</i>
<i>of MacElroy</i>

668
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,557
<i>will not mesh</i>
<i>with Michaels' improvisations</i>

669
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,557
<i>or they create great music together</i>

670
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,478
<i>and reinvent the sport</i>
<i>in their own image.</i>

671
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,792
They're laughing at us.

672
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,797
They laughed at Louis Armstrong when
he said he was gonna go to the moon.

673
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,514
Now he's up there laughing at them.

674
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,275
<i>Well, they titled this routine</i>
<i>"Fire and Ice."</i>

675
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,551
<i>They've always been that way</i>
<i>as competitors, as individuals</i>

676
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,477
<i>and now as a pair team?</i>

677
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,158
<i>So appropriate.</i>

678
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,398
<i>So far, so good.</i>

679
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,037
<i>Their first move's so difficult.</i>
<i>Throw triple Axel.</i>

680
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,513
First throw.

681
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,029
<i>Man down.</i>

682
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,835
<i>What an unbelievably disastrous</i>
<i>beginning to this routine!</i>

683
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,558
I've never fallen once in competition.

684
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,557
Come on. Take my hand.

685
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,153
We can do this.

686
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,109
<i>And they're up.</i>

687
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,356
Come on, Denver, get off your asses!

688
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,719
Let's go!

689
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,349
<i>And the crowd responds.</i>

690
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,268
<i>It's the first time they've shown them</i>
<i>any level of support.</i>

691
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,876
<i>Side by side double Axels!</i>
<i>Beautifully delivered!</i>

692
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,273
<i>And again, a male-male pair team.</i>

693
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,075
<i>They're doing things</i>
<i>that no other pair would dare to do.</i>

694
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,199
<i>Incredible!</i>

695
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,319
<i>So many moves in this programme</i>
<i>I've never heard of before.</i>

696
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,509
Yes!

697
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,833
<i>Unbelievable finish</i>
<i>to an incredible routine!</i>

698
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,269
<i>And they've won this crowd over!</i>

699
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,829
Yes!

700
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,592
<i>This might be enough</i>
<i>to send them to Montreal</i>

701
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:42,077
as the first male-male representatives
this sport has ever seen.

702
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,997
<i>History in the making.</i>

703
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,349
Yeah!

704
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,192
We love you, Denver!

705
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,594
City by the bay! John Denver!

706
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,069
- Was the fire really necessary?
- Ask them.

707
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,110
- That's what I'm talking about!
- I'm so proud of you. Good job.

708
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,753
What up, homes?

709
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,392
You guys were great out there.

710
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,715
Thanks. I'm Jimmy.

711
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,400
I know. Katie.

712
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,954
I know.

713
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,158
I like your buttons.

714
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,116
Jimmy, come on. The scores are up.

715
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,112
- Good luck.
- You, too.

716
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,310
Did you see that?
They were actually pretty good.

717
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,158
Yeah, they were really good. Way to go.

718
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,633
None of what they did
was on your video.

719
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,478
That's all right.
Let's not let them get into our heads.

720
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,591
Into our head?
Not only did we embarrass Marky Mark,

721
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,199
we let down the Funky Bunch.

722
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,551
<i>... 5.9, 5.9, 5.8, 6.0!</i>

723
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,635
- Yes! Yes!
- Oh, my gosh!

724
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,990
We're going to Montreal, bitch!

725
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,668
Well, it's all smiles
here in the Crest kiss and cry area.

726
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,712
You're the guys everybody's
talking about. How does it feel?

727
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,912
You know, we're just so grateful
for this wonderful opportunity

728
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,234
to be out here on the ice again...

729
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,158
Michaels and MacElroy are a freight
train from hell, okay?

730
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,909
We're going straight up
the ass of the competition, Scott.

731
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,951
I'm not gonna say wow, but wow!

732
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:31,039
They got by on 97 percent adrenaline
and three percent bullshit.

733
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:35,312
If they wanna take home the gold,
they gotta do something spectacular.

734
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,475
Robert, I know where this is going.

735
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,955
How many times
do you have to make the same mistake?

736
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,117
Till I get it right.
You gotta trust me, Jesse.

737
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,910
I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life
in a cage of fear.

738
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,838
Top of the morning. And it is a beaut.

739
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,833
Do you mind? I'm trying to eat here.

740
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,631
Just thought you'd like to see
what a skater's body really looks like.

741
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,149
Go ahead, drink it in. Don't be shy.

742
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,909
Looking's for free.
Touching's gonna cost you something.

743
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,038
Checking out my ink?

744
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,677
Some people refer to me
as the Illustrated Man.

745
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,998
Each tattoo tells a different tale.
They're like chapters of my life.

746
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,351
Really? So, what's that one about?

747
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:31,036
That one represents the dragon lady.
You might know her as Michelle Kwan.

748
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:34,789
That's Michelle Kwan, most decorated
figure skater in US history?

749
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,115
- You tapped that?
- Sure did.

750
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,029
But perfection can drive a woman mad.

751
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,991
She was ready to quit,
hang up her skates

752
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,192
settle down and pop out
a few little Chazzlings.

753
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,357
I couldn't let her do it, not the way I roll.

754
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,914
So, what's that one with the horse?

755
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,717
My blonde Ukrainian she-devil.

756
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,876
Not Oksana Baiul?

757
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,230
At 16, she won the gold, turned pro,

758
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,989
and was named one of Barbara Walters'
most fascinating persons of 1994.

759
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:06,193
Yeah. But don't let her fool you.
She's as cold as the ice she skates on.

760
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,071
She's like dry ice.
Wait. She's colder than that.

761
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,191
- What's colder than dry ice?
- I don't know.

762
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,595
I'll tell you what is. Oksana.

763
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,679
What about that one on your shoulder?
Who's that?

764
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,396
That one? It's nothing.

765
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,316
What about you? You got any tats?

766
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,512
I had my face painted
at the Blueberry Festival one year.

767
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,278
Seems about right.

768
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,710
Well, I could have one.
I could have a killer one.

769
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,630
I have a crush on the enemy,
Katie Van Waldenberg.

770
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:41,954
Good choice, my man.

771
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,832
Yeah. How's that for forbidden love?

772
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,713
I have no idea, but I'd like to find out.

773
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,789
- Wait. What are you doing?
- I'm calling her. Or rather, you are.

774
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,672
- I can't do that. It's crazy.
- It's not crazy.

775
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,915
What am I supposed to say?

776
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,871
- No, you can't. I can't.
- It's ringing. Go.

777
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,676
- Sorry.
- Maybe it's Nike.

778
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,555
Van Waldenberg Companies.

779
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,432
Talk. Relax.

780
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,198
Hi. It's Jimmy MacElroy. Is Katie there?

781
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,759
It's MacElroy, for her.

782
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,711
What? For me? Why?

783
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,718
- I can't do it.
- I'll coach you. Get on the phone.

784
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,114
Stranz?

785
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:20,995
<i>Hello?</i>

786
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,953
Okay. "Yo. It's the Mac attack.
What up?"

787
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,392
Yo. Hi. It's the Mac attack. What up?

788
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:31,315
Okay. Say, "Oh, my, you're just
catching me getting out of the shower."

789
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,715
- Sell yourself.
- Will you be quiet?

790
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,556
You know, you just caught me
getting out of the shower.

791
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,716
- She just got out of the shower.
- Oh, me likey.

792
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,671
- I have to call her back. This is so rude.
- No! Are you insane?

793
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,598
- She's gonna hear you.
- Get back on the phone. Say, "Shower?

794
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,473
"I gotta get me one of those
'cause I just got back from the gym

795
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,591
"doing my squat thrusts."

796
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,750
I gotta...
Yeah, shower. I need one of those

797
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,111
'cause I just got back from the gym
doing my squat thrusts.

798
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,754
"Squat thrusts must be hard, real hard."

799
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,669
<i>Squat thrusts are hard.</i>

800
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,837
- "Real hard."
- Real hard.

801
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,199
"They're hard, all right. But it's worth it
to get a sweet burn deep in your thigh."

802
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:10,074
It's worth it to get a deep burn
in my sweet thighs.

803
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,398
"You know
how you can soothe a nasty burn?

804
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,832
"Pour some sweet cream on it."

805
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,879
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>what you can do for a burn?</i>

806
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,149
<i>Pour sweet cream on it.</i>

807
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,191
Oh, my God, you've bagged a wild lynx.

808
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,993
Okay, say, "Sounds to me like
your cream needs to be whipped",

809
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,235
and then go...

810
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,118
I was wondering if you wanted
to get a snow cone sometime?

811
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,275
What?

812
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,153
Yeah. I would like to get a snow cone.

813
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,511
I haven't had a snow cone
in a couple of years, actually.

814
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,629
No, you have to be sexy.

815
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,751
Say you want a snow boner.
Snow boner.

816
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,110
8:00 tonight. That sounds great.

817
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,471
It will
"get me time to get my jugs waxed."

818
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,310
Okay. Well, I'll see you.

819
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,315
What happened? What's the word?

820
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,670
8:00 tonight. We did it!

821
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,119
Oh, my God!

822
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,359
Nice lift.

823
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,795
All right, listen up. You guys barely
squeaked by at Nationals.

824
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,751
How are we gonna compete
against teams

825
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,279
that have been doing this for years?

826
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,753
There's only one way.

827
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,793
Okay. What do you guys have
that none of the other teams have?

828
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,872
- Twin dongs?
- Exactly.

829
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,309
We have to do something
that only two men can do together.

830
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,715
Something never seen before.

831
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,831
Jesse, put in the tape.

832
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,829
Come on. Put in the tape, Jesse.

833
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,794
Thank you.

834
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,759
Jimmy, I never told you this before,
but I used to coach pairs.

835
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,119
I was on track
to head up the Olympic squad.

836
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,879
I wanted it badly,
so I developed a move.

837
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,629
A move the likes of which the world
had never seen before.

838
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,151
A move so revolutionary, so dangerous

839
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,717
that it would have catapulted the team
that stuck it straight to the top.

840
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,998
And like many revolutionary ideas,

841
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,873
it just scared the shit
out of the establishment.

842
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,274
So I quit.

843
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:11,515
And I took it to the one place on earth
batshit crazy enough to give it a try.

844
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,589
North Korea.

845
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,073
Of course.

846
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,272
Behind the Bamboo Curtain, they call it

847
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,472
"The Iron Lotus."

848
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,874
Look at the grace, the beauty.

849
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,358
They almost have it, until...

850
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,239
Oh, my gosh.

851
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,391
Okay.
What do you say, let's give it a try?

852
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,876
- Are you nuts?
- What? That's crazy.

853
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,069
Come on, what are you talking about?

854
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,953
See, after all these years,
I know what went wrong.

855
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,069
The physics were off.

856
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,236
It was a man and a woman,
that's why it didn't work.

857
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,828
You're two men. You should be fine.

858
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,633
Be warned.
The Iron Lotus demands your respect.

859
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,637
She has no time for Ione wolves, Chazz.

860
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,149
Jimmy, you've gotta be willing
to improvise.

861
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,316
You two are the last pieces
of the puzzle.

862
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,158
Go on! Fit them together!

863
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,717
Keep your speed up.

864
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,639
Keep it up!

865
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,915
Jimmy! Don't let your legs buckle!

866
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,158
Come on, Chazz, focus! Focus!

867
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,789
My nut-sack!

868
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,434
You gotta be careful, man.
Unlike you, I actually use these things.

869
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,913
Oh, yeah? Well...

870
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:46,397
Well, well, yeah, you're right.
I'll try to be more careful next time.

871
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,229
Sorry.

872
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,077
Look, I didn't mean to drag your balls
into the discussion.

873
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,431
That was uncalled for.
They're fine, I overreacted.

874
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,990
All right, gentlemen,
let's get up and try it again.

875
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,793
Let's do this.

876
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,669
This was my favourite place growing up.

877
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,631
By the way, you look really nice.

878
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:22,753
Oh, really?
I like your glitter-tooth necklace thing.

879
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,233
Oh, thanks.

880
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,269
Foy, can I have another blue one?

881
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:32,078
You guys were so good at Nationals,
it scared my brother and sister.

882
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,192
- They wanted me to spy on you.
- Really?

883
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,038
Is that why you're going out
with me right now?

884
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,195
No!

885
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,674
Really.

886
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,715
I don't care if they win.
I don't care about skating at all.

887
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,354
I mean, really,
what's so great about skating, anyway?

888
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,074
It's basically just gliding,
trying not to fall,

889
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,430
with a couple of jumps thrown in, right?

890
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,757
And Spandex and glitter. Egos.

891
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,549
Ice blows.

892
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,835
Sorry.

893
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,790
But it's not the ice.
It's what the ice lets you do.

894
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,671
Out there, I feel like I can do anything.

895
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,118
It's the only place
where life makes sense.

896
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,155
You've never skated?

897
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,952
When I was a kid, a little.

898
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,878
But my brother and sister
don't like anyone to steal their focus.

899
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,877
My life was nothing but focus.

900
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,956
You know what I got
for my tenth birthday?

901
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,152
A six-pack of protein shakes
and a subscription to <i>Men's Health.</i>

902
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,032
I didn't have a tenth birthday.

903
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,879
My sister told all my friends
I was in jail for armed robbery.

904
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,037
When I was nine, my dad insisted
on having me circumcised

905
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,752
to minimise wind resistance.

906
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,316
While driving me to skating practice,
my parents were in a fatal accident.

907
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,953
My brother and sister
blame me for their death

908
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,958
and they force me to work for them
like a slave.

909
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:07,555
Wow.

910
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,949
I never really thought of that
as a romantic story before.

911
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,798
So, how'd it go with your lady?
Carve up any ice with your wiener?

912
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,309
All right, ladies, tea party's over.

913
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,069
We got two days till Montreal.
I wanna see an Iron Lotus.

914
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,999
Okay, try it again.

915
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,189
You're gonna kill him! Watch the blade!

916
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,509
Come on!

917
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,799
Try it again!

918
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,475
One more. I'm really close.

919
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:08,072
<i>Hello, and welcome, everyone,</i>
<i>to the Orbitz World Wintersport Games</i>

920
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,156
<i>here in beautiful Montreal, Canada.</i>

921
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,997
<i>The world turns its eyes</i>
<i>now to this frozen sanctuary</i>

922
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,918
<i>as the globe's finest athletes</i>

923
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,793

924
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:24,994
<i>And so, now we are honoured</i>

925
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:29,796
<i>and spectacle of these,</i>
<i>the 20th World Wintersport Games.</i>

926
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,558
Didn't you once say, and I quote,

927
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,672
"Jimmy MacElroy
is a lifeless robot on the ice"?

928
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,314
- He would never say such a...
- Yes, I did.

929
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,716
But I was referring
to the precision and beauty of robots.

930
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,512
If they'd published
the rest of the quote...

931
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,598
They did publish the rest of your quote.
You go on to say,

932
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,551
"I've had lint at the top of my ass crack

933
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,592
"with more personality
than that Daddy's boy." End quote.

934
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,154
All right,
Mr Smart Reporter, showing off.

935
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,193
You figured out how to work
the Google on the Internet machine.

936
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,912
Well, here's a new quote for you,
all right?

937
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:09,033
Chazz Michaels and Jimmy MacElroy
are figure skating. Boom!

938
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,309
Boom!

939
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,957
Jimmy! Has pairs skating
helped your popularity?

940
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,074
Absolutely.
I have the best fans in the world.

941
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,112
I mean,
we have the best fans in the world.

942
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,070
No, that's in the other room.

943
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,315
Boom.

944
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:40,755
Nice.

945
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,154
Great! Press loves them,
and now so do the sponsors.

946
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,349
Stranz!

947
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:49,996
So, Katie, it looks like your date
went really well the other night, huh?

948
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,839
What? I guess so. Why?

949
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,996
No reason. I was just wondering
how it went. Did it go well?

950
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,509
- Yeah, we had snow cones...
- Oh, that's so great.

951
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,756
We want you to turn your attention
to Chazz now.

952
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:00,835
What?

953
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,793
MacElroy's heart is like
a beautiful apple that's in your hand

954
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,478
and now you need to bite it.

955
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,319
- Nothing breaks up a team faster than...
- Herpes.

956
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,148
Jealousy.

957
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,675
No. I'm not gonna make
Chazz Michael Michaels

958
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,755
fall in love with me.

959
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,836
Who's talking about love?
We just want you to have sex with him.

960
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,474
What? No!
I am not gonna have sex with Chazz.

961
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:21,398
Come on, Katie.
Do the honourable thing here.

962
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,353
The honourable thing is to walk away
and that is exactly what I'm doing.

963
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,268
Okay. Stranz, let her go. It's okay.
She's made up her mind.

964
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,311
We'll just move on to Plan B.

965
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,635
- What's Plan B?
- I'm sorry, don't worry about that.

966
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,672
You stood your ground. Good for you.
We respect that.

967
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,189
But if something should happen
to your new boyfriend's leg,

968
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:43,471
I don't know, under his knee,
or above his ankle?

969
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,719
At least you did the honourable thing.

970
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,753
- Where're you going?
- Sex addicts meeting.

971
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,828
- "Turn weakness into strength."
- Good for you.

972
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,394
Thanks, brother man.
Have a good night.

973
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,635
See ya!

974
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,513
This must be for you.

975
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,034
So glad you're all here.

976
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,988
Okay, let's get started.

977
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,790
Chazz, would you like
to start the day off by sharing?

978
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,158
I was just trying to find some peace.

979
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,192
A haven,
a place where I could feel safe.

980
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,071
And then what happened?

981
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,549
Well, she was my yoga instructor.

982
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,471
So I knew she was limber.

983
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:47,038
But, Chazz, you realise this would just
set you back

984
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,754
and further hurt your progress

985
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,996
in maintaining control over your libido,
correct?

986
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:54,190
Yes. Thank you, Taylor.

987
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,154
Definitely.

988
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:02,272
Until her friend, a massage therapist,
walked in the door naked.

989
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,389
Easy, Chazz.

990
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,919
With a big bottle of canola oil

991
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,749
and a monkey who was trained
to work on a video camera.

992
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,871
And she rocked my world.

993
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,228
Guys!

994
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:16,148
Chazz, I have asked you to leave before
and I don't wanna do it again.

995
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:17,315
Taylor, come on, man.

996
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,910
Let's just move on.
Who'd like to talk about Chlamydia?

997
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,918
Syphilis, gonorrhoea, et cetera.
Should we...

998
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,393
Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. I was

999
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,955
having sex. A lot.

1000
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,752
Welcome. Welcome.

1001
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,155
Why don't you go ahead
and introduce yourself?

1002
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,633
I know her.

1003
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,159
I'm Katie.

1004
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,349
And?

1005
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,031
Oh, and I'm a sex addict.

1006
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,275
Hi, Katie.

1007
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,469
Hey, Katie.

1008
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,718
Wow, so, you're a sex addict, too.

1009
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,796
Sex, sex, sex. What can I say?

1010
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:54,754
Right. Right. I mean, you said it all.
It's such a burden.

1011
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,519
I mean, people don't realise what
we go through on a day-to-day basis.

1012
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:00,598
Why don't you come to my room tonight
and we can comfort each other?

1013
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,358
11:55 sharp.

1014
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,275
Come on, people, break it up!

1015
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,390
God grant me the serenity not
to have sex with my friend's girlfriend

1016
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:25,308
the courage to go home tonight without
having sex with my friend's girlfriend

1017
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,919
and the wisdom
to know that masturbation

1018
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,032
is sometimes
the most sensible solution.

1019
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,513
Yeah. Okay.

1020
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:36,879
Oh, sweet Jesus.

1021
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,275
You're right on time. Come in.

1022
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:45,595
Would you like some champagne?

1023
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,995
No, I can't, I...

1024
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,949
Actually I just came by 'cause
I had something I had to say to you.

1025
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,069
What?

1026
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,839
Do you have a bathrobe or a parka
you could...

1027
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,951
Sorry. I'm hot.

1028
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,195
Wouldn't you feel more comfortable

1029
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,198
saying what you need to say
from the bed?

1030
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,878
Probably not.

1031
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,149
It's a Posturepedic.

1032
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,317
Well, then, in that case,
it's good for my back,

1033
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,476
so might as well try it.

1034
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,916
Okay, here it goes.

1035
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:17,953
I know that sex,
I know that sex addiction is a disease.

1036
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,399
Oh, God, they feel so good.

1037
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,953
Oh, God, this is so wrong.

1038
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,593
Jimmy's my friend.
I'm not gonna do this.

1039
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,914
Wait. Do you really mean that?

1040
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,076
Yes, I think so. No.

1041
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,154
Yes, I do. I do.
I can't go through with this.

1042
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,315
Thank God.

1043
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,158
- Oh, God, what a relief.
- Yeah.

1044
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,918
He's got a heart of gold.

1045
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,277
You sex demon! You, you sex fiend!

1046
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,356
No, you got it all wrong.

1047
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,270
Impure! Impure!

1048
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,958
- Jimmy, wait!
- Hey, wait! Brother man!

1049
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,071
- Nothing happened!
- Jimmy!

1050
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,917
Wait! Jimmy!

1051
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,837
- Get away!
- Jimmy! No!

1052
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,879
Damn it.

1053
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,756
Come on, pick up. Come on, buddy.

1054
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,872
<i>Hey, it's Jimmy.</i>
<i>If you can dream it, you can do it.</i>

1055
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,553
Jimmy, it's me, Chazz.

1056
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:10,116
Look, what happened back there,
so not a big deal.

1057
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:14,552
Just think of it as like a boob handshake
between me and your lady's...

1058
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:18,150
Look, that's not coming out right.
I'll explain it. Call me back, please.

1059
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,793
It's me, Chazz.

1060
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,633
I'm committed to this thing
called friendship.

1061
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:23,829
And I ain't going nowhere.

1062
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,349
And if you think I'm going anywhere,
you're wrong. You know why?

1063
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,550
Because I will not back down, ever!

1064
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:32,514
I've won a lot of radio contests,
because I refused to get off the line!

1065
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,918
If we went to a Halloween party dressed
as Batman and Robin, I'd go as Robin.

1066
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,598
That's how much you mean to me.

1067
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,870
That was stupid that I said that.
You know what? No.

1068
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,355
I don't think that's stupid.
I'm glad that I said that.

1069
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,114
Hey, turd-face, guess what?

1070
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,559
I've taken every single one
of your teddy bears,

1071
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,796
and I've stuffed them down my pants.

1072
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:52,390
Hey, yikes. Sorry.

1073
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:57,910
For about a month,
my urine smelled like marshmallows.

1074
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,353
<i>Don't wanna close my eyes</i>

1075
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:06,556
<i>Don't wanna fall asleep</i>
<i>'Cause I miss you Jimmy</i>

1076
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,316
<i>And I don't wanna miss a thing</i>

1077
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:14,032
<i>So call me back now!</i>

1078
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,594
<i>It's Jimmy.</i>
<i>If you can dream it, you can do it.</i>

1079
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:24,876
Hey, it's me again. Jimmy, please,
call me back, so I can explain.

1080
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:31,470
Wow! Nice work.
Somebody got busy in a big way.

1081
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,272
Scene of the crime.

1082
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,836
For your information,
I didn't have sex with Chazz.

1083
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,313
Fine. "Make love." Whatever.

1084
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,793
I didn't sleep with Chazz.

1085
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,592
- What?
- But congratulations!

1086
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,553
- I feel as slimy as if I had.
- Where do you think you're going?

1087
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,433
To make this right!
Jimmy needs to know the truth!

1088
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,073
You would do that to your own family?

1089
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,394
Don't give me that guilt trip.

1090
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,637
After all we've done for you?
After all you did to Mom and Dad?

1091
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:55,069
Mom and Dad
were not wearing their seatbelts

1092
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,510
and they made
an improper left-hand turn.

1093
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,555
Come on, Katie, don't go.
We love you and stuff.

1094
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,319
Look, it's up to us, okay?

1095
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:08,592
We are forced to take Michaels and
MacElroy out of play, no matter what.

1096
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,359
That might require some bad behaviour.

1097
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:16,952
<i>Hello, and welcome to day three</i>
<i>of the Orbitz World Wintersport Games.</i>

1098
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,594
<i>The best Chinese and Russian pairs</i>
<i>have fallen away,</i>

1099
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,154
<i>setting up</i>
<i>the ultimate gold medal showdown.</i>

1100
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:26,956
<i>Just two pairs remain. Both American.</i>
<i>Both hell-bent on reaching the top.</i>

1101
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,229
<i>And it's come down to this.</i>
<i>Tonight, they leave it all on the ice.</i>

1102
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,554
<i>The big story here is</i>

1103
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,513
<i>the men's pairs figure skating team</i>
<i>of Michaels and MacElroy.</i>

1104
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,790
These same-gendered sensations
have taken

1105
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,639
centre ice in the hearts of
millions of skating fans everywhere.

1106
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,876
They've literally taken this sport
by storm.

1107
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:48,869
Jimmy.

1108
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:51,873
Jimmy's here at the arena, you ass.

1109
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:55,796
He's been staring at a pack of gum
for nine hours. What'd you do to him?

1110
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,519
I'm on my way.

1111
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,394
Taxi!

1112
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:14,073
World Wintersport Games.
And yes, I am Chazz Michael Michaels.

1113
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,158
- Hey, Stranz.
- Hi.

1114
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:23,712
<i>Skaters, please clear the ice</i>
<i>in preparation for the pairs competition.</i>

1115
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,513
Thank you so much.

1116
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,952
Oh, my gosh. Can you...

1117
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,548
Sorry, Chazz. Nothing personal.

1118
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:49,951
Actually, it's quite the opposite.

1119
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:53,356
See, your days of
stealing the spotlight are over.

1120
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,871
You crazy bastard!

1121
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,108
Damn it.

1122
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:16,559
What are you doing?

1123
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:21,672
You are evil. Pure evil!

1124
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:24,268
Your whole family's evil! Your brother.

1125
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,034
And most of all, your sister.

1126
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,435
Don't even think about putting us
in the same league.

1127
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,835
If she was half the woman I was,
she would have done her job

1128
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,791
and slept with your partner
like I told her to.

1129
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,433
- She didn't?
- No.

1130
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,790
She couldn't, because of you.

1131
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,799
I don't get it.

1132
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,033
Gross. Get me out of here!
Somebody help me!

1133
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:05,200
Whoever invented rope
was a real a-hole.

1134
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:10,396
I'm late, sis.
My hair is just not cooperating.

1135
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,279
Oh, crap.

1136
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:18,595
Okay.

1137
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:23,436
Who's gonna save you now, Chazz?

1138
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:27,155
Is Little Lord MacElroy gonna come
and meet you down here?

1139
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,958
Oh, great.

1140
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:57,312
Hey, there!

1141
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,070
What are you doing there?
No. Wait, wait. It's okay. No.

1142
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,350
Stranger danger! Stranger danger!

1143
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,118
No, please!

1144
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:27,837
Let's do it, Chazz!

1145
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:31,919
All right, Stranz.
Time for a little Chazzle Dazzle.

1146
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,834
Beautiful.

1147
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,358
I'm coming, Chazz.

1148
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:41,958
Give me your hand.

1149
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,471
- I won't hurt you.
- I'm coming for you, Chazz!

1150
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,192
Damn it, Stranz.

1151
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,071
Have you seen Jimmy?
I can't find him anywhere.

1152
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,349
Oh, yeah. He was here a minute ago.

1153
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:53,358
And if you find him, would you tell him
to get his ass down here?

1154
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,559
I really appreciate this.

1155
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:06,309
That man who's chasing us
is trying to kill me. So, thanks.

1156
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,992
Who are you supposed to be anyway?
Rod Serling?

1157
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,919
JFK.

1158
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:39,989
- It's gonna make sense.
- No, no, no. It'll be fine. Yeah.

1159
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:42,679
That's lame.

1160
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,191
Try to get through that!

1161
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:57,912
Don't make me kill her.

1162
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,718
Snowflake!

1163
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,789
<i>From the United States,</i>

1164
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:56,310
<i>the pairs team of</i>
<i>Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg.</i>

1165
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,231
<i>So, the favourites,</i>
<i>Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg</i>

1166
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,588
<i>now taking the ice.</i>

1167
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,278
<i>As Marilyn Monroe and JFK,</i>

1168
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,472
<i>they'll be dramatising</i>
<i>a forbidden romance, Jim.</i>

1169
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:12,078
<i>I take pride in the words,</i>
"Ich bin ein Berliner!"

1170
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,069
<i>Calling for preparation on ice</i>
<i>of the United States team</i>

1171
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,111
<i>of Michaels and MacElroy.</i>

1172
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:35,150
<i>Well, that was an interesting take</i>
<i>on American history.</i>

1173
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,191
<i>Indeed. I think it's worth noting,</i>

1174
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:40,551
<i>the fantastic attention to detail</i>
<i>this pair has demonstrated.</i>

1175
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:44,309
<i>An absolutely seamless use of props</i>
<i>integrated into choreography,</i>

1176
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:48,035
<i>that is both physically impressive</i>
<i>and artistically moving.</i>

1177
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:51,072
<i>A rare ballet of ice and history.</i>

1178
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,636
<i>And those scores keep Stranz</i>
<i>and Fairchild in first place,</i>

1179
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:56,751
but Michaels and MacElroy are up next.

1180
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,749
Coach! Coach! Did I make it in time?
Where's Chazz?

1181
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:01,949
Where the hell you been?

1182
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,196
Your partner's not here in 30 seconds,
I have to disqualify you.

1183
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:05,275
I know, I know.

1184
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:10,398
We're finished. Done. That's it. It's over.
Damn it. Just like that.

1185
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,476
Coach, he'll be here.

1186
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,199
<i>Skaters to the ice.</i>

1187
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:29,198
<i>Twenty seconds to disqualification.</i>

1188
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:32,551
<i>Jimmy MacElroy stands alone</i>
<i>at centre ice.</i>

1189
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:35,672
<i>And you have to wonder</i>
<i>what is going on.</i>

1190
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:38,758
<i>Well, this is Rice without Montana.</i>

1191
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:42,869
<i>Ali without Frazier.</i>
<i>Han Solo without Chewbacca.</i>

1192
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,109
Jimmy!

1193
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,751
Hey, Jimmy! Jimmy!

1194
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:52,074
Chazz!

1195
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:56,109
Hey, I didn't sleep with Katie!

1196
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:58,879
- I know!
- We didn't even get to second base.

1197
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,831
Well, maybe I did.

1198
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,190
What I felt in my pants
was weird and shameful.

1199
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,912
Okay, we can discuss that later!

1200
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,029
You kind of have to be down here
right now

1201
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:07,434
or we're gonna be disqualified!

1202
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,278
Katie is not a whore!

1203
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:12,153
Okay, I get it! Just stop talking!

1204
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,599
Okay! Okay!

1205
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:15,551
<i>- Skaters to the ice.</i>
- Hold on!

1206
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:18,194
<i>Ten seconds to disqualification.</i>

1207
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,549
Wow.

1208
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,035
Yeah!

1209
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,075
<i>Wow! A dramatic entrance</i>
<i>for Chazz Michael Michaels.</i>

1210
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,592
I'm okay!

1211
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:46,869
I'm all right!

1212
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,308
I'm okay.

1213
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,036
<i>And there's another</i>
<i>unique Michaels skill.</i>

1214
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:02,277
<i>Out of his clothes in a hurry</i>
<i>when he has to.</i>

1215
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,549
<i>And women's skating champion</i>

1216
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:06,069
<i>Sasha Cohen</i>
<i>catches Michaels'jock strap.</i>

1217
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:07,997
I love you, Chazz!

1218
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,917
- I made it.
- I knew you would.

1219
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,554
Let's capture the dream.

1220
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,353
Capture the... I love it.
Where'd you come up with that?

1221
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:23,914
- I have no idea where I came up with it.
- Cool.

1222
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,270
- Let's kick some ice.
- Okay.

1223
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:33,913
<i>Well, Scott, the boys seem to be</i>
<i>using a science fiction theme tonight.</i>

1224
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:37,476
<i>Fitting, considering these two men</i>
<i>may very well be the future of the sport.</i>

1225
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,794
<i>Well, I'll tell you something, Jim.</i>

1226
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:41,195
<i>It's like these two men did</i>
<i>beam in from outer space,</i>

1227
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,515
<i>to flip this sport inside out.</i>

1228
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,679
<i>The lights are on and so is this crowd.</i>

1229
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,234
<i>A Mr Roboto to start the routine.</i>

1230
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,675
<i>And they hit it beautifully!</i>

1231
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,800
<i>Everything they do</i>
<i>is drenched in drama.</i>

1232
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:08,830
<i>Side-by-side skate clashes.</i>

1233
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,710
<i>And more sparks!</i>
<i>Look at the athleticism here!</i>

1234
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:22,637
<i>No other pair in the world could do this!</i>

1235
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,035
<i>Fireworks display in Montreal.</i>

1236
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:26,673
<i>Incredible.</i>

1237
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:32,874
What are you doing?

1238
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,798
We're freestyling.
You're the steak, I'm the sizzle.

1239
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:36,875
We didn't practise that.

1240
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,197
Do it for Katie.
Burn up the ice with your red hot love.

1241
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,639
<i>Michaels and MacElroy</i>
<i>turn up the thermostat.</i>

1242
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:59,513
These guys put the "bone" in Zamboni.

1243
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:01,189
It's over.

1244
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,753
All the endorsements, everything gone.

1245
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,075
Oh, my God, I can't get a real job.
It'll kill me.

1246
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,033
God, I have to do everything
in this family.

1247
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:22,920
<i>A serious stumble</i>
<i>in an otherwise perfect routine.</i>

1248
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,998
<i>Perfection's what they need if</i>
<i>they want to beat Stranz and Fairchild.</i>

1249
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:28,076
- I think I broke my ankle.
- What?

1250
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:30,475
I'm gonna put some weight on it to see.

1251
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:36,232
<i>I don't know, Scott.</i>
<i>I'm not sure, interpretive dance moves</i>

1252
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:37,839
<i>are gonna win these judges over.</i>

1253
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,916
- What the hell are they doing?
- Something's wrong.

1254
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:42,508
I can't do the Lotus
with a shattered ankle.

1255
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,870
I'm just a man, for God's sake.

1256
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:47,234
We'll switch places.

1257
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:49,635
I swear to God, if you cut my head off.

1258
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,471
They're going for the Iron Lotus,
in reverse.

1259
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,955
My God.
This is happening all over again.

1260
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:02,509
<i>They're picking up speed</i>
<i>for something spectacular.</i>

1261
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,631
<i>Looks like</i>
<i>they might be trying something</i>

1262
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,239
<i>I have never seen done.</i>

1263
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:08,715
<i>It is the fabled Iron Lotus.</i>

1264
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:12,196
No! Don't do it! I was wrong!
It's suicide!

1265
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,991
<i>And they nail it!</i>
<i>Unbelievable performance!</i>

1266
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:00,680
<i>This crowd is going wild!</i>
<i>They're on their feet!</i>

1267
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:04,952
<i>I never thought I'd see it with</i>
<i>my own eyes, the fabled Iron Lotus!</i>

1268
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:08,072
<i>A historic event here in Montreal.</i>

1269
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:11,112
Michaels and MacElroy
have brought the legend to life.

1270
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,237
Scott, I seem to have wet my pants.

1271
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:15,237
Chazz, Chazz. We did it!

1272
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:17,756
- Did we win?
- I don't know.

1273
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:20,351
I think I see the Virgin Mary.

1274
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,118
No. That's not her.

1275
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:29,319
We got you, Mr Michaels. Let's go.

1276
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,079
- Oh, I don't wanna die.
- You'll be okay.

1277
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:36,431
- I don't wanna die.
- Take a huff of that. Here we go.

1278
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:38,039
I'm gonna have to cut your pants off.

1279
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:41,596
Okay, but start up near the crotch.
That's a better access point.

1280
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:54,954
You were incredible.

1281
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:58,356
Really?
I thought my landing was all bad...

1282
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:04,718
You've been practising.

1283
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,956
Chazz taught me some stuff.

1284
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,079
Stranz Van Waldenberg.

1285
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:24,829
You're under arrest for the desecration
of an international icon.

1286
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,188
Snowflake.

1287
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:30,158
- It was her idea. She broke his ankle!
- What?

1288
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,434
You idiot!

1289
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:33,913
I hate you.

1290
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,358
Come on now. Let's get out of here.

1291
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,550
And that's why I was a sex addict.

1292
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,875
Because no one ever loved me.

1293
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,074
But I learned something here today.

1294
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:53,192
That ice doesn't belong here.

1295
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,952
It belongs out there.

1296
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:59,351
Out on the ice in an ice rink.

1297
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,516
I never had a father, okay?

1298
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,592
But I don't care!

1299
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,235
Because now I've got a brother.

1300
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:10,878
This is my brother!

1301
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:13,833
And this is my brother's new girlfriend.

1302
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,436
And she is not a whore.

1303
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:20,880
I'm in a lot of pain.
I feel like I'm gonna barf.

1304
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,719
Chazz, they got to get you to a hospital.
Come on.

1305
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,469
No. And miss the smell of sweet gold?

1306
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:30,672
Not on your life.

1307
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:43,469
Thank you.

1308
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:49,550
Jimmy, you did it!
The gold medal, baby! You did it!

1309
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:52,433
I wanna wear the gold medal, naked.

1310
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,473
Thank you.

1311
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:05,273
I've got something I wanna show you.
I had it done last weekend.

1312
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:12,592
That's you,
the wolf that runs with the Lone Wolf.

1313
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:15,951
So that the Lone Wolf
never has to be alone again.

1314
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:18,036
That's how much you mean to me, bro.

1315
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:19,479
You were drunk when you got it,
weren't you?

1316
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,591
Yes. Absolutely hammered.

1317
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:24,715
- Welcome to the pack.
- Thanks.

1318
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,713
Let's get outta here.

1319
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,239
- Now?
- Yeah.

1320
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:16,833
USA!

1321
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:20,676
The gold medal has been won
by Jimmy and Chazz,

1322
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,030
thanks to Hector's idea!

1323
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,033
We did it, Hector!

1324
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:26,918
Boom! We sure did.

1325
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,794
Thank you, Hector. He did it for us.

1326
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:31,873
Where is Hector?

1327
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,639
Here I am, guys. We did it. High-fives.

1328
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,833
Cool. Way to go, guys. Gold medal.

1329
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:40,713
You guys are the best. Hey, Jimmy?

1330
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,353
Yeah, Hector?

1331
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,916
Can you give me a time-out here
with Chazz?

1332
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,553
Yeah, sure. Are you crying?

1333
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:48,352
No. I'm fine.

1334
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:52,190
Okay. I'll go over here. Sandwich.

1335
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:54,478
Hey. Chazz?

1336
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,598
What is it? Boom.

1337
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:59,632
I just wanna say
you guys are partners now.

1338
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,758
I've been friends with him forever,

1339
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:03,950
and you take good care of him.

1340
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,559
I will. Boom.

1341
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,557
He just, he loves food.

1342
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:10,433
And he likes dreams and whispers

1343
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,915
and his favourite movie is <i>Short Circuit</i>

1344
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,917
and <i>Fried Green Tomatoes.</i>

1345
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:17,634
And just watch over him. All right?

1346
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,558
I will. Boom.
You have my word. High-five.

1347
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,633
God bless you.

1348
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:25,275
Sweet. Jimmy, you can come back.

1349
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,197
What you guys were talking about?

1350
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,151
Just stuff, you know.

1351
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:31,396
Hey, guys, you're amazing.

1352
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,954
I just wanna say keep dreaming

1353
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,959
because there's a lot of dreams
to be had.

1354
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:38,308
USA.

1355
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:41,748
USA.
