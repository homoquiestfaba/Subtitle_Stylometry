1
00:00:22,652 --> 00:00:25,363
- Are you ready?
- Are you?

2
00:00:27,074 --> 00:00:28,408
Well...

3
00:00:28,658 --> 00:00:30,368
Seat belts.

4
00:00:38,794 --> 00:00:42,380
I forgot one thing.

5
00:00:45,843 --> 00:00:47,635
Then go.

6
00:02:28,985 --> 00:02:30,569
Hey.

7
00:02:31,779 --> 00:02:33,824
No, we go just for the weekend.

8
00:02:35,783 --> 00:02:38,912
Tell him that I'm flying there
after two weeks.

9
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:43,749
Alright. I will think about it.

10
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:45,751
Is that your brother?

11
00:02:47,254 --> 00:02:48,587
Hey, Doug.

12
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:51,756
He says hello.

13
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:54,467
I have to go.

14
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:56,594
You are dear. Bye.

15
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:03,018
Is everything okay?

16
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:07,898
Calls to stop. Now I belong to
you for the whole weekend.

17
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,360
How can your mother?

18
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,696
He...

19
00:03:16,073 --> 00:03:19,492
Case does not change.

20
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:21,786
Actually I do not know.

21
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:27,375
Makes good to get away from.

22
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:32,422
- I'm excited.
- So do I.

23
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:41,932
our nature

24
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:19,426
Is this pihatienne?

25
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,204
Is this it?

26
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:48,164
Is. How come?

27
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:53,293
Beyond belief,
because you have hidden this from me.

28
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,461
I have not concealed anything.

29
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,715
What a mess.

30
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,428
You said this mökiksi.

31
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,305
It's just a house.

32
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:11,186
Detectives got it cheap.
Before here was not expensive.

33
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,540
Did you bring the goods go
in the fridge?

34
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:35,876
You mean soy yogurt?
Yes, sir.

35
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,839
It is not, however, spoil easily.

36
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,302
I go to the toilet quickly.

37
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,782
Deuce! I forgot prevention.

38
00:06:07,991 --> 00:06:11,287
I packed them in your bag.

39
00:06:23,006 --> 00:06:26,302
DOES your father seats himself?

40
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:29,263
No. My mother care valtaosasta-

41
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:32,224
- But then the father took the house.

42
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:36,228
She probably gets to work in your yard
of the local schoolchildren.

43
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:42,318
- Where are we going?
- Come on.

44
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:52,951
Are those nice tits?

45
00:06:53,161 --> 00:06:55,330
Yeah.

46
00:06:58,124 --> 00:07:00,876
- Time weird.
- Children are doing weird stuff.

47
00:07:01,336 --> 00:07:04,130
What would you say,
if our children were running here?

48
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:06,299
What children?

49
00:07:06,508 --> 00:07:09,843
I forgot to tell you,
menkkani that are overdue.

50
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:15,057
- Do it again.
- I do not.

51
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:17,726
- Try again.
- Your turn.

52
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,238
Feels good is not it?

53
00:07:28,446 --> 00:07:30,697
I can not continue.

54
00:07:41,251 --> 00:07:43,336
OK...

55
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:02,645
What is that?

56
00:08:05,315 --> 00:08:06,358
What?

57
00:08:07,484 --> 00:08:09,278
Listen.

58
00:08:09,986 --> 00:08:12,239
the bad guys come
to do us mischief.

59
00:08:13,948 --> 00:08:15,741
Disgusting things ...

60
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:24,209
What?

61
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:32,884
What the hell?

62
00:08:33,468 --> 00:08:34,595
Who is it?

63
00:08:34,802 --> 00:08:38,055
What the hell?

64
00:08:38,473 --> 00:08:41,185
- Who is it?
- My father.

65
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,028
Exported stuff upstairs.

66
00:08:53,237 --> 00:08:54,738
- He is.
- Who?

67
00:08:54,946 --> 00:08:56,282
I do not know. My father is.

68
00:08:58,284 --> 00:08:59,868
Would you help clean up? Get dressed.

69
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:02,829
Do not freak out.

70
00:09:03,038 --> 00:09:04,998
- Get dressed.
- Puen, upon.

71
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:07,376
Here.

72
00:09:12,381 --> 00:09:14,217
Do not freak out.

73
00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:17,010
- Yes All right.
- What was that?

74
00:09:18,803 --> 00:09:20,306
Where?

75
00:09:21,014 --> 00:09:22,225
Where are my underpants?

76
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:33,818
Hey.

77
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:36,905
Hey.

78
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,786
Seth.

79
00:09:43,994 --> 00:09:45,455
Hey.

80
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,832
I did not realize that you were here.

81
00:09:49,584 --> 00:09:51,085
So...

82
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,466
This was a last minute thing.
We hopped in the car and Martha ...

83
00:09:57,091 --> 00:09:58,175
... On the way.

84
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,682
- Hello, I'm Gil.
- Andie.

85
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:06,309
Nice to finally meet you.

86
00:10:06,518 --> 00:10:08,143
So, at last.

87
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:20,030
Hey.

88
00:10:24,243 --> 00:10:26,829
This is my friend Vicky.

89
00:10:27,664 --> 00:10:29,499
Vicky, this is my son Seth.

90
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,711
- Hey.
- And Angie.

91
00:10:32,918 --> 00:10:36,005
- Andie.
- Excuse me. Andie.

92
00:10:36,213 --> 00:10:38,257
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

93
00:10:39,675 --> 00:10:43,261
I just said Vickylle,
that your sister would soittanut-

94
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,514
- So confused the car.

95
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:49,142
Martha gave us a car.

96
00:10:50,686 --> 00:10:52,313
We do not have guessed you'd
come here.

97
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:56,941
In your email you said, that you
would have a whole month on business trips.

98
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,654
My plan changed.

99
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,913
Well, we pack kamamme
and we will leave you alone.

100
00:11:11,122 --> 00:11:12,666
Are you going to you?

101
00:11:13,334 --> 00:11:16,127
We came here just for a day.

102
00:11:16,795 --> 00:11:17,920
You sure?

103
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:22,258
So, we were just leaving.

104
00:11:22,468 --> 00:11:24,720
Do not be late takiamme.

105
00:11:26,012 --> 00:11:28,349
Do you have someone in Brooklyn gig?

106
00:11:30,434 --> 00:11:33,520
Something like that.

107
00:11:36,105 --> 00:11:37,148
Alright.

108
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:47,533
The restroom is a terrible mess.

109
00:11:47,742 --> 00:11:50,745
Did you see?
Wet towels on the floor.

110
00:11:50,952 --> 00:11:53,080
And did you see the yard?
He does not clean up their tracks.

111
00:11:53,288 --> 00:11:56,459
He throws stuff in a dumpster in
the direction of and leave them to it.

112
00:11:56,667 --> 00:12:00,755
- He did not even know my name.
- He has a bad nimipää.

113
00:12:01,963 --> 00:12:05,426
Do not you find it strange,
that me loving poikaystäväni-

114
00:12:05,635 --> 00:12:07,637
- Has not told me his father?

115
00:12:07,845 --> 00:12:10,222
It has nothing to do with you.

116
00:12:10,972 --> 00:12:16,813
This is so typical of him.

117
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,690
Why can not he be
more like her sister?

118
00:12:19,898 --> 00:12:21,651
Martha would not do such a thing.

119
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:24,111
Should I ask them to stay?

120
00:12:25,153 --> 00:12:26,279
What?

121
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:28,990
I do not want her to receive
the starting passports for me.

122
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:32,412
As for the "departure passports'?
He wanted to back to the city.

123
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:36,164
Do you really think that they drove
here until one day?

124
00:12:36,915 --> 00:12:38,250
Gold...

125
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:44,714
I know that you had planned everything.
It is true golden ...

126
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,133
... But your father is here.

127
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:50,386
I have not even met him.
It would be strange to bust out.

128
00:12:50,595 --> 00:12:53,139
It would be weirder to stay
and his guest with a woman.

129
00:12:53,347 --> 00:12:54,974
How do you know that?

130
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:58,310
Annoyed him,
when we said leave?

131
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,148
No. He wants that we leave.

132
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,694
Hopefully, I did not interrupt.

133
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:08,279
You do not at all.

134
00:13:09,238 --> 00:13:11,616
I was just wondering ...

135
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:16,538
... That you can stay for dinner,
If you want.

136
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:21,793
You would leave
before the backlog, which is a good idea.

137
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:27,591
But if you really want to,
Vicky will soon begin to cook.

138
00:13:28,132 --> 00:13:30,134
He is not a ...

139
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:34,180
Well, the kitchen is not
his strong point.

140
00:13:34,764 --> 00:13:35,849
But...

141
00:13:38,726 --> 00:13:41,436
Sounds great.

142
00:13:41,645 --> 00:13:43,606
We have not eaten.

143
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:51,572
Sounds good.

144
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:56,326
He delights.
Food is about an hour away.

145
00:13:56,827 --> 00:13:58,704
Mr. Sherwood?

146
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,667
Just tell Gil.
I'm still not so old.

147
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,169
Gil, I do not want to be ilonpilaaja-

148
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:09,339
- But I'm a vegan.

149
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:12,258
- Vegan.
- Yes.

150
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:17,263
- Are you a vegan?
- I'm not a vegetarian.

151
00:14:17,472 --> 00:14:20,016
He is a liar.
He eats fish.

152
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,897
All right, I'll tell Vickylle.

153
00:14:27,775 --> 00:14:30,068
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

154
00:14:33,363 --> 00:14:34,907
Looks really good.

155
00:14:35,113 --> 00:14:37,241
Thank you. No, this is nothing.

156
00:14:55,342 --> 00:15:00,347
There are movies,
if you want to look at something later.

157
00:15:00,557 --> 00:15:04,434
TV does not work. I paid for it in 2000
dollars, and does not even start.

158
00:15:04,644 --> 00:15:07,021
I invite someone to take a look at it.

159
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:16,280
Seth might be able to fix it.

160
00:15:18,115 --> 00:15:19,576
Are you adept with the machines?

161
00:15:19,784 --> 00:15:22,202
I do not, but I'm used to
to do in the studio of any kind.

162
00:15:22,411 --> 00:15:26,373
I can not delete the images from your computer.
I do not know what to do.

163
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,376
Maybe you can help?

164
00:15:37,466 --> 00:15:38,719
Hey.

165
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:41,262
No, now is well suited.

166
00:15:42,138 --> 00:15:44,725
Yup. Why did he do so?

167
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,772
I already said,
it will be resolved in arbitration.

168
00:15:50,981 --> 00:15:54,985
It is really embarrassing,
while about it publicly.

169
00:15:55,192 --> 00:15:56,485
Yes, it should get the hang of.

170
00:15:56,695 --> 00:16:01,449
<I> - Was it opera </i>?
- It is, Pagliacci.

171
00:16:02,408 --> 00:16:06,830
It is his lempimusikaalinsa.
He went always watching it.

172
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:10,499
You have not told all.

173
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:15,421
Forget the statements of witnesses.
I wonder what can it?

174
00:16:15,631 --> 00:16:17,007
So you're a machine wizard.

175
00:16:17,214 --> 00:16:21,011
Not me...
I help my friend to build studion-

176
00:16:21,218 --> 00:16:23,346
- That is, the plug must be poked
into the wrong sockets.

177
00:16:23,554 --> 00:16:26,515
Right, right, bye.

178
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:33,272
Can you believe that Ben was threatened
to bring the case before a judge?

179
00:16:43,783 --> 00:16:44,909
This is tasty.

180
00:16:45,117 --> 00:16:47,535
- Thank you, that you put the food.
- Really good.

181
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:49,080
It is nothing.

182
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:53,125
You should use a lot of butter,
if they want people to like the food.

183
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:56,419
Is this butter?

184
00:16:57,379 --> 00:16:58,839
Seth, it's okay.

185
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:06,179
What now?

186
00:17:06,596 --> 00:17:08,390
You are a vegan.

187
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:12,519
- It is okay.
- Where the problem is?

188
00:17:12,853 --> 00:17:14,980
- I put the butter.
- So what?

189
00:17:15,188 --> 00:17:16,941
It is an animal product, Gil.

190
00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:18,901
It is not an animal.

191
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,696
He talked about vegetarianism.

192
00:17:21,904 --> 00:17:24,280
- What the hell difference does it make?
- It does not matter.

193
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:28,160
- What can you eat?
- Can I have a salad?

194
00:17:28,368 --> 00:17:30,495
Clear.

195
00:17:31,245 --> 00:17:33,790
Seth, you said eat a fish.

196
00:17:33,998 --> 00:17:37,334
I applied mine vegan.

197
00:17:39,628 --> 00:17:42,882
- Why did you choose to vegan?
- In other words, I do not eat this.

198
00:17:48,722 --> 00:17:50,181
Alright.

199
00:17:55,937 --> 00:17:57,354
Seth, providing the most viiniä-

200
00:17:57,563 --> 00:18:00,357
- But it is the bacteria,
receiving the wine käymään-

201
00:18:00,566 --> 00:18:02,359
- And you probably do not want to kill them.

202
00:18:02,568 --> 00:18:04,821
- Gil.
- How would I know?

203
00:18:08,532 --> 00:18:09,743
Thank you.

204
00:18:37,435 --> 00:18:39,104
- Of course.
- I did not know.

205
00:18:39,312 --> 00:18:40,688
So.

206
00:18:40,898 --> 00:18:42,440
- Thank you dear.
- You're welcome.

207
00:18:42,648 --> 00:18:44,777
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

208
00:18:44,985 --> 00:18:46,153
It is okay.

209
00:18:49,865 --> 00:18:51,950
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

210
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:13,889
If you fix the TV'S,
maybe we can watch a movie.

211
00:19:14,807 --> 00:19:18,977
I can look at it
and find out where the problem is.

212
00:19:19,186 --> 00:19:21,479
I glanced at it already. It does not work.

213
00:19:23,023 --> 00:19:25,275
I invite someone to fix it.

214
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:33,908
This is from the 1600's.

215
00:19:46,879 --> 00:19:49,548
Does anyone play Scrabble?

216
00:19:52,176 --> 00:19:53,510
Not anyone?

217
00:19:53,718 --> 00:19:55,847
I'm a pretty clever.

218
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:02,019
Alan to be tired.

219
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:04,856
I think I'll go to bed.

220
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:11,153
I apologize for his stunts.

221
00:20:13,197 --> 00:20:14,406
What tricks?

222
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:17,492
He behaved like a teenager in vain.

223
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:20,162
Sometimes people fall
stuck in a rut.

224
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,206
Who supposedly behaves like that?

225
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,208
You are right.

226
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,795
Why do you put their food butter?

227
00:20:29,004 --> 00:20:31,047
- Is that a joke?
- Is not.

228
00:20:31,256 --> 00:20:32,966
We would have avoided the whole mess.

229
00:20:33,174 --> 00:20:34,926
How had I known,
they do not eat butter?

230
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:37,345
- I told you.
- You talked about vegetarianism.

231
00:20:37,553 --> 00:20:39,973
What difference does it make?
You'd asked minulta-

232
00:20:40,181 --> 00:20:42,683
- Before you asked them to stay.

233
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:45,811
It's just one night.

234
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:50,191
I had a lovely evening.

235
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:52,568
- But not this evening.
- But not this evening

236
00:20:52,776 --> 00:20:54,321
So.

237
00:20:54,528 --> 00:20:55,654
I do not know.

238
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:59,117
She is a bit crazy.

239
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:02,536
You could say "interesting".

240
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,125
Alright. No, I understand.

241
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:09,085
Got to go.

242
00:21:09,877 --> 00:21:11,670
You are dear.

243
00:21:13,547 --> 00:21:15,633
Do not you talked about this
afternoon?

244
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,303
He played with when you were
in the bathroom.

245
00:21:27,852 --> 00:21:30,314
We should leave in the morning.

246
00:21:31,648 --> 00:21:32,732
Alright.

247
00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:35,735
Let's do what ever you want.

248
00:21:35,945 --> 00:21:39,281
- Why did you say about it?
- How?

249
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:43,826
- Passive-aggressively.
- I meant that if you want to go.

250
00:21:44,827 --> 00:21:47,957
Have you eaten enough?
Are you hungry?

251
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:52,169
Is not.

252
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:55,297
- I'll put something, if you want to.
- I'm not hungry.

253
00:22:01,678 --> 00:22:02,972
Alright.

254
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:11,438
Vicky is my sister lived.

255
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:14,649
He is not so young.

256
00:22:17,027 --> 00:22:19,487
If the father wants to conceal things,
Let them keep their secrets.

257
00:22:19,696 --> 00:22:21,489
I do not want to know.

258
00:22:24,866 --> 00:22:26,785
Why did you do that?

259
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:28,454
Excuse me.

260
00:22:28,662 --> 00:22:31,165
- Why is it bothering you?
- There is a bully, but ...

261
00:22:31,374 --> 00:22:32,874
Well...

262
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:36,254
It seems childish.

263
00:22:36,712 --> 00:22:38,922
I did not do it in relation to your father.

264
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,051
The same it, even though you would do.

265
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,763
- In a way, teitkin.
- Alright.

266
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:51,893
Alright.

267
00:23:40,608 --> 00:23:41,984
Hey.

268
00:23:43,445 --> 00:23:45,988
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

269
00:24:03,423 --> 00:24:04,882
What the hell is this?

270
00:24:05,092 --> 00:24:06,468
I thought it was coffee.

271
00:24:06,675 --> 00:24:09,221
It was a thermostat,
when I got up in the morning.

272
00:24:10,514 --> 00:24:12,557
What the heck Yerba Mate is?

273
00:24:13,141 --> 00:24:14,267
It is Yerba Mate.

274
00:24:14,476 --> 00:24:16,894
- I put on a new pot of.
- Do not.

275
00:24:17,104 --> 00:24:20,107
The pan is full of it.

276
00:24:21,023 --> 00:24:22,817
Putsaan it.

277
00:24:24,025 --> 00:24:28,447
I'm not going to clean up their footsteps
throughout the weekend.

278
00:24:34,661 --> 00:24:38,748
- I did not know that you know how to paddle.
- They have kayaks.

279
00:24:38,957 --> 00:24:40,917
It would be nice to try them later.

280
00:24:41,127 --> 00:24:42,169
I'm not very clever.

281
00:24:42,378 --> 00:24:44,796
That's why you have those four.

282
00:24:45,004 --> 00:24:48,217
They are not for me but for my father.
He forced us to.

283
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:52,138
He is kajakkimestari.
He or she can even eskimo rolls.

284
00:24:52,637 --> 00:24:56,850
Along with the kayak with your name.

285
00:25:05,817 --> 00:25:07,944
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

286
00:25:09,446 --> 00:25:10,947
Where are you going?

287
00:25:12,699 --> 00:25:14,618
Vicky and me
must return to the city.

288
00:25:15,994 --> 00:25:17,204
So...

289
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:19,956
Hey, we were going to ...

290
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,751
We were going to leave,
so you should ...

291
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,172
It is okay.
All is not worth to leave.

292
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:32,092
Stay and enjoy the weekend.
It is reportedly pretty.

293
00:25:38,056 --> 00:25:40,017
I do not want to talk about it.

294
00:25:40,226 --> 00:25:43,354
- It is easier if we leave.
- Are not you going to even try?

295
00:25:43,563 --> 00:25:45,481
I tried already. I have tried 15 ...

296
00:25:45,689 --> 00:25:50,612
Hey. Do you really
to leave so soon?

297
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:51,987
So.

298
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:59,329
<I> We got tickets to tonight's </i>
Don Giovanni presentation.

299
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,248
It is reportedly awesome.

300
00:26:02,457 --> 00:26:05,543
I just found ... I mean canoes kayaks.

301
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:08,086
He said that you kajakkimestari.

302
00:26:08,296 --> 00:26:09,796
Is that what he said?

303
00:26:10,088 --> 00:26:13,967
He loves it
and talks about it constantly.

304
00:26:14,302 --> 00:26:16,887
I hear you're the only one who knows how to
alaskankääryleen to do?

305
00:26:17,095 --> 00:26:19,390
- It's sushi.
- Eskimo rolls.

306
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:22,142
I do not know. It has been a while.

307
00:26:22,351 --> 00:26:24,101
Maybe you could get help.

308
00:26:24,311 --> 00:26:27,730
I've never tried it,
and you are the champion ...

309
00:26:28,773 --> 00:26:31,610
It would be nice to see a master at work.

310
00:26:31,817 --> 00:26:33,237
So.

311
00:26:33,445 --> 00:26:34,987
- You could keep the lesson.
- Yes.

312
00:26:35,196 --> 00:26:37,156
I'm not a teacher.

313
00:26:37,366 --> 00:26:40,535
And I did not bring a bathing suit.

314
00:26:40,826 --> 00:26:42,828
The basics only.

315
00:26:44,248 --> 00:26:46,583
We can change plans.

316
00:26:49,294 --> 00:26:51,338
I think that...

317
00:26:51,837 --> 00:26:54,882
We could call,
but tickets can hardly be replaced.

318
00:26:58,928 --> 00:27:02,599
You should paddle steady tahtiin-

319
00:27:02,807 --> 00:27:04,559
- So that the boat is not
accidental keikahda.

320
00:27:04,767 --> 00:27:06,143
Like this?

321
00:27:06,353 --> 00:27:08,272
Just like that.

322
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,190
How do I stop this?

323
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,900
Oh God.

324
00:27:13,109 --> 00:27:15,529
It is not a vehicle.
It is not water brakes.

325
00:27:15,737 --> 00:27:16,904
Excuse me.

326
00:27:17,113 --> 00:27:19,283
Seth was a pretty good kid.

327
00:27:20,031 --> 00:27:22,117
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

328
00:27:22,326 --> 00:27:27,205
He knew very creative
over rocks and rapids.

329
00:27:27,415 --> 00:27:28,749
Can you teach a translation?

330
00:27:28,957 --> 00:27:30,543
- You would under water.
- So what?

331
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:32,753
You kastuisit.

332
00:27:33,671 --> 00:27:35,589
I never learned them properly.

333
00:27:40,218 --> 00:27:41,512
I will do the translation.

334
00:27:41,721 --> 00:27:44,598
Is it dangerous, Gil?

335
00:27:47,225 --> 00:27:49,978
Probably. Hold your breath.

336
00:27:57,027 --> 00:28:00,323
Gil! Please help him.

337
00:28:03,074 --> 00:28:06,077
- Pretty good old pierulta.
- It was awesome.

338
00:28:07,954 --> 00:28:09,623
Hey, race.

339
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:13,251
- I can not believe you were gonna say.
- Hey, race.

340
00:28:13,461 --> 00:28:15,211
- What does it mean?
- Nothing.

341
00:28:15,421 --> 00:28:17,465
- You have to make one.
- I could not even if I wanted to.

342
00:28:17,672 --> 00:28:18,798
- You know how you do.
- I do not.

343
00:28:19,006 --> 00:28:21,509
Kajakkini only be satisfied out of the water.

344
00:28:21,718 --> 00:28:23,927
- Now make one.
- I can not.

345
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:25,929
- Do it!
- Come on.

346
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:27,390
- Do it!
- Hey!

347
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:29,141
Excuse me.

348
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,896
- That's enough. You will end up in the water.
- You go first!

349
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,983
- Come here.
- No no!

350
00:28:38,901 --> 00:28:40,403
Oh God.

351
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:45,282
Seth, do it in translation.

352
00:28:45,492 --> 00:28:48,620
Where are you?

353
00:28:49,953 --> 00:28:51,748
Make a translation!

354
00:28:54,376 --> 00:28:55,627
Seth!

355
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:57,169
Oh God.

356
00:28:57,754 --> 00:28:59,171
Seth.

357
00:29:04,511 --> 00:29:06,220
Oh God.

358
00:29:07,054 --> 00:29:08,347
Even ...

359
00:29:10,475 --> 00:29:12,976
That was not nice.

360
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:14,562
You think this is funny?

361
00:29:15,938 --> 00:29:17,399
- Is.
- Fine true?

362
00:29:17,606 --> 00:29:21,735
- Hey, come on. In peace now.
- What do you in peace?

363
00:29:22,403 --> 00:29:24,738
- I'm serious.
- Fine true?

364
00:29:26,657 --> 00:29:27,741
Gil.

365
00:29:33,121 --> 00:29:36,124
Seth, get her!

366
00:29:36,332 --> 00:29:38,918
No. Do not, Seth. Please.

367
00:29:39,127 --> 00:29:41,045
Your turn. Sorry.

368
00:29:41,254 --> 00:29:43,381
- Do not do it.
- I am sorry.

369
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:47,886
Do not do it.
The water is dirty. Please, do not.

370
00:29:48,094 --> 00:29:51,682
My hair! You can not know...

371
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,476
Oh God...

372
00:29:54,685 --> 00:29:56,812
No worries.

373
00:29:58,354 --> 00:29:59,815
- This is not funny.
- Come on.

374
00:30:00,022 --> 00:30:02,776
- Here is shallow.
- Click here to get out.

375
00:30:04,486 --> 00:30:05,696
This is good.

376
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,823
Forgive me.

377
00:30:08,197 --> 00:30:12,076
This will reach the bottom.
Try yllätkö.

378
00:30:12,285 --> 00:30:15,037
- Yllän.
- Good. Now.

379
00:30:21,418 --> 00:30:23,504
- All right.
- It was not fun.

380
00:30:26,298 --> 00:30:27,633
Huhuu!

381
00:30:29,802 --> 00:30:31,386
Deuce.

382
00:30:51,448 --> 00:30:53,743
Should we apply for boats?

383
00:30:54,451 --> 00:30:56,453
You seemed to be having fun.

384
00:30:56,662 --> 00:30:59,957
I do not mean to be rude.
This is just not a good time.

385
00:31:00,165 --> 00:31:01,291
Excuse me.

386
00:31:01,501 --> 00:31:03,293
Can we go to the boat, Mom?

387
00:31:03,503 --> 00:31:04,879
Asked about the point.

388
00:31:05,086 --> 00:31:06,881
- Is that muusikkopoikasi?
- Is.

389
00:31:07,088 --> 00:31:09,132
I thought that Vicky phoned.

390
00:31:09,341 --> 00:31:11,468
We got the message, when we were already here.

391
00:31:11,677 --> 00:31:14,179
We thought to give the children to stretch your legs.

392
00:31:14,386 --> 00:31:17,849
I am sorry.
Today is not a good day.

393
00:31:18,057 --> 00:31:21,770
- I thought that Vicky declared unto you.
- No worries.

394
00:31:21,978 --> 00:31:24,271
I do not want to interrupt perhehetkeänne.
I do understand.

395
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,607
At any other time.

396
00:31:25,815 --> 00:31:27,526
- Alright.
- Sorry extra effort.

397
00:31:27,734 --> 00:31:28,902
Mother, I want the boat.

398
00:31:29,109 --> 00:31:31,947
Soon you boat
the option for a weekend.

399
00:31:33,364 --> 00:31:34,574
- Who wants ice cream?
- I will.

400
00:31:34,783 --> 00:31:35,825
- Ice cream?
- I will!

401
00:31:36,367 --> 00:31:37,786
I.

402
00:31:56,178 --> 00:31:58,055
Do not blame me,
that they ignored my inquiry.

403
00:31:58,264 --> 00:32:02,059
It does not have to be the message.
You had to talk to them.

404
00:32:04,938 --> 00:32:07,064
The memories come to mind.

405
00:32:08,524 --> 00:32:10,276
I'm going for a walk.

406
00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:43,308
Hello.

407
00:32:45,603 --> 00:32:46,937
Hey.

408
00:32:48,396 --> 00:32:51,984
You will not eat anything unhealthy,
but smoke.

409
00:32:53,777 --> 00:32:54,903
Well...

410
00:32:55,111 --> 00:32:57,031
Al, it is not the cigarette.

411
00:32:58,657 --> 00:33:00,575
Not really.

412
00:33:01,409 --> 00:33:02,745
What?

413
00:33:03,662 --> 00:33:05,998
Sorry, I did not like ...

414
00:33:06,205 --> 00:33:09,542
- I can stub out it.
- I'm not a cop.

415
00:33:13,713 --> 00:33:15,213
You sure?

416
00:33:19,426 --> 00:33:21,595
Do you want?

417
00:33:21,804 --> 00:33:24,057
Do you offer me marijuana?

418
00:33:25,099 --> 00:33:27,060
I think I'll offer.

419
00:33:27,267 --> 00:33:29,979
After all, lawyers do drug testing?

420
00:33:30,187 --> 00:33:32,230
Probably should do.

421
00:33:34,566 --> 00:33:35,902
- If you want...
- No thanks.

422
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,738
I have not smoked weed in 35 years.

423
00:33:39,113 --> 00:33:43,241
I'm sorry to hear that. What a pity.

424
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,972
Well why not.

425
00:34:24,573 --> 00:34:27,953
Did you get tickets for tonight's canceled?

426
00:34:29,746 --> 00:34:33,709
Yes.
We called and we agreed on a new era.

427
00:34:34,751 --> 00:34:40,173
<I> I felt like a savage, </i>
so I took Don Giovanni clear.

428
00:34:41,424 --> 00:34:43,509
It ended last week.

429
00:35:01,027 --> 00:35:02,070
- Hey.
- Hey.

430
00:35:02,278 --> 00:35:04,197
What hommailet?

431
00:35:04,405 --> 00:35:07,909
I fixed the rotten spool.

432
00:35:08,118 --> 00:35:10,494
I thought to go up to take a look.

433
00:35:11,203 --> 00:35:12,788
We built that?

434
00:35:12,997 --> 00:35:15,498
One hundred years ago,
together with my father and my sister.

435
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:18,210
Do you want to go see?

436
00:35:18,418 --> 00:35:20,087
Ylöskö over there?

437
00:35:20,712 --> 00:35:25,341
Here is raging in at least 30 storm.
It took them, and take us also.

438
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,969
Little comfort.

439
00:35:27,178 --> 00:35:30,181
Go first.
I will make sure not to fall.

440
00:35:30,388 --> 00:35:32,975
I grew up in the city.
Play in the streets.

441
00:35:33,184 --> 00:35:35,770
- Alright.
- This is not...

442
00:35:35,978 --> 00:35:37,353
lhan how you want.

443
00:35:37,562 --> 00:35:41,483
Wait. Is it a supermaket?

444
00:35:42,026 --> 00:35:44,779
It was when I was 12 years old.

445
00:35:45,237 --> 00:35:47,655
It's so beautiful.

446
00:35:47,865 --> 00:35:49,657
It should be finer.

447
00:35:49,867 --> 00:35:53,536
I wanted to try to copy
part of Prospect Park.

448
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:59,334
One landscape architect,
who works ...

449
00:35:59,542 --> 00:36:00,961
Prospect Park?

450
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:04,799
Clinton used her
Chappaquan site at.

451
00:36:06,008 --> 00:36:10,428
He pay for the property,
and not listen to a word.

452
00:36:12,387 --> 00:36:16,810
Did not work in your yard short form
of the local schoolchildren?

453
00:36:27,278 --> 00:36:30,447
I just thought ...

454
00:36:31,908 --> 00:36:34,618
I do not remember olleeni
In such a cloud.

455
00:36:35,036 --> 00:36:36,745
What kind?

456
00:36:38,998 --> 00:36:40,917
All kinds of things are going on.

457
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:43,962
So much is happening.

458
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,632
I remembered it to be relaxed.

459
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:51,552
You seem relaxed.

460
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,720
But everything is so intense.

461
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:59,726
It is as if I could see the trees leaf
moving one by one. See now.

462
00:37:01,271 --> 00:37:03,273
I wonder how many magazine
in that tree is?

463
00:37:04,773 --> 00:37:06,733
I do not know.

464
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,402
Forty thousand.

465
00:37:11,321 --> 00:37:14,199
One hundred thousand magazines.

466
00:37:15,616 --> 00:37:18,036
- Is it the final answer?
- As long as I guessed.

467
00:37:18,245 --> 00:37:21,915
You're a very punctual.

468
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,127
Right scientist.

469
00:37:26,627 --> 00:37:28,462
I can not believe-

470
00:37:29,089 --> 00:37:31,341
- That you own all of this.

471
00:37:34,261 --> 00:37:37,555
So.

472
00:37:38,932 --> 00:37:40,976
All of this. It is...

473
00:37:41,184 --> 00:37:43,353
- Have you been here before?
- I do not.

474
00:37:44,187 --> 00:37:45,605
Never.

475
00:37:46,522 --> 00:37:50,360
This is a big deal for him.

476
00:37:53,613 --> 00:37:55,531
That he brought me here.

477
00:37:58,118 --> 00:38:01,914
For him, this is the place,
where she got to be with you.

478
00:38:02,122 --> 00:38:03,290
Hardly.

479
00:38:03,497 --> 00:38:08,253
When we were here, he usually
hid in my tree house.

480
00:38:15,675 --> 00:38:19,055
I got the only lake in the dirt
purified iholtani.

481
00:38:20,389 --> 00:38:22,807
I do not think it will harm,
we did not have pants?

482
00:38:23,392 --> 00:38:26,728
- What?
- When we were walking through the bushes.

483
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:30,066
I do not understand what you fear.

484
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:34,987
Ticks, Lyme disease, bedbugs.

485
00:38:39,241 --> 00:38:43,287
Should you lie,
if I ask the people that came here?

486
00:38:43,996 --> 00:38:45,497
I...

487
00:38:47,499 --> 00:38:51,836
Does the house have already been sold,
or is he still hierooko shops?

488
00:38:52,421 --> 00:38:55,216
I thought your father would have told.

489
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:59,844
He gets what he wants to do at their house.

490
00:39:06,809 --> 00:39:10,813
- I start to feel hungry.
- It happens.

491
00:39:11,563 --> 00:39:14,234
Did you get enough
nuts and berries for breakfast?

492
00:39:14,442 --> 00:39:15,484
Did you eat chestnuts?

493
00:39:15,693 --> 00:39:17,736
- You know, from that good ...
- Bambuversoja?

494
00:39:17,945 --> 00:39:21,992
Tonight, you get to enjoy
vegaaniaterian delicious.

495
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,744
Not now, after all riehaannuta.

496
00:39:27,247 --> 00:39:30,541
It must be made,
because you are so prejudiced.

497
00:39:30,749 --> 00:39:33,669
Do we eat twigs?

498
00:39:33,877 --> 00:39:36,547
- We do not. You may even ...
- Speech of Peru.

499
00:39:36,755 --> 00:39:39,717
You may take vegan,
when the master chef has done its job.

500
00:39:39,925 --> 00:39:43,471
Mestarikokkiko?
I saw you on TV. You were excellent.

501
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:45,556
I do not Seth.

502
00:39:45,764 --> 00:39:47,392
Seth?

503
00:39:49,518 --> 00:39:51,438
Does he not put you food?

504
00:39:51,645 --> 00:39:55,983
Sethkö putting me food?
No. How come?

505
00:39:56,192 --> 00:39:59,737
He is like
personal huippukokkini.

506
00:39:59,945 --> 00:40:04,075
Hard to believe.
His mother does not know how to cook eggs.

507
00:40:04,283 --> 00:40:07,202
No, Teresa knows how to put good food.

508
00:40:07,411 --> 00:40:09,288
You know Teresa?

509
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:12,582
I know.

510
00:40:13,624 --> 00:40:16,627
In other words...
We have met a couple of times.

511
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,513
- Incinerated bring out?
- Place it on fire.

512
00:40:26,721 --> 00:40:28,515
Why stop?

513
00:40:32,186 --> 00:40:36,022
Where he learned to cook?

514
00:40:37,982 --> 00:40:40,610
In restaurants, where he was working.

515
00:40:43,197 --> 00:40:45,615
Right.

516
00:40:45,823 --> 00:40:49,453
I knew that he was a waiter,
but the chef?

517
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:52,539
That I do not know,
but he worked in the kitchens.

518
00:40:52,747 --> 00:40:55,501
Fine restaurants,
such as Mercer.

519
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:58,128
- Then there was the Eleven Madison.
- Eleven Madison?

520
00:40:58,337 --> 00:41:01,756
We went there often.
I took Vicky Eleven Madison.

521
00:41:01,963 --> 00:41:04,425
- It's a great place.
- He spent there?

522
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:08,387
No, he hated it. He...

523
00:41:08,595 --> 00:41:13,434
Fortunately, he is no longer
need to do them a job.

524
00:41:21,192 --> 00:41:22,859
He never ...

525
00:41:24,153 --> 00:41:28,657
Is not he ever mention me?

526
00:41:39,668 --> 00:41:41,920
He is afraid,
what do you think about me.

527
00:41:45,924 --> 00:41:48,594
How long have you been together?

528
00:41:49,387 --> 00:41:52,390
Maybe two years.

529
00:41:56,185 --> 00:41:57,727
Where do you live?

530
00:41:57,936 --> 00:42:00,814
- You're asking we live together?
- Do you live in?

531
00:42:01,356 --> 00:42:02,857
Do not you want to ask your father?

532
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:06,861
He says true things openly.

533
00:42:09,364 --> 00:42:11,449
Can you stop?

534
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:14,452
- Why? It bothering you?
- Downright uncomfortable.

535
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:20,749
Apparently, it is your intention.
I am now out enough to upset.

536
00:42:36,349 --> 00:42:39,810
I'm sorry I almost
you cut off earlier.

537
00:42:42,606 --> 00:42:44,316
It is okay.

538
00:42:57,621 --> 00:42:59,206
Thank you.

539
00:43:07,546 --> 00:43:11,634
How do you remove the planks felt?

540
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:14,261
Sometimes you sound like a shrink.

541
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:16,721
How does it feel, when I sound like?

542
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:19,642
Are you really a shrink?
Oh God.

543
00:43:20,351 --> 00:43:23,270
Manhattan: lawyer and a psychiatrist.

544
00:43:23,479 --> 00:43:29,025
Brooklyn: Lord Musician. and Andie
I guess there is a non-commercial organization.

545
00:43:29,235 --> 00:43:30,860
He told you.

546
00:43:31,612 --> 00:43:32,862
- Not been told.
- Do not you really know?

547
00:43:33,071 --> 00:43:35,823
- I do not.
- No way in hell.

548
00:43:36,242 --> 00:43:37,825
Are all predictable?

549
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:49,796
I spent the whole time here yön-

550
00:43:50,004 --> 00:43:52,466
- In the middle of February.
It was really cold.

551
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:54,677
- Why did you do that?
- I do not know.

552
00:43:54,884 --> 00:43:57,220
Dad yelled at me or something.

553
00:43:57,429 --> 00:43:59,682
Bedtime My time After-

554
00:43:59,888 --> 00:44:03,183
- I slipped in here and waited.

555
00:44:04,977 --> 00:44:06,604
What happened?

556
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,565
Nothing.

557
00:44:10,566 --> 00:44:12,735
I got a terrible rhinitis.
I was absent from school for two weeks.

558
00:44:12,943 --> 00:44:14,987
The father did not even mention the issue.

559
00:44:16,572 --> 00:44:19,534
She barely even knew,
that you were here.

560
00:44:40,137 --> 00:44:41,431
Hey.

561
00:44:45,142 --> 00:44:46,184
Where are you going?

562
00:44:46,394 --> 00:44:50,063
This is good.
I do not want to waste it.

563
00:44:59,406 --> 00:45:00,906
No thanks.

564
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,950
You do not know what you're missing.

565
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:11,752
- But she ...
- He refused.

566
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,836
He was 7-vuotias-

567
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:18,132
- And refused to go into the pond
without a cowboy hat.

568
00:45:18,342 --> 00:45:21,886
Otherwise, he was completely naked.

569
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,349
Cute. Oh, man.

570
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:29,268
They are coming. Take it easy.

571
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,698
- Hey.
- Hey.

572
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:43,617
Hello, cowboy.

573
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:47,746
What's so funny?

574
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:51,123
We just ...

575
00:45:52,626 --> 00:45:54,960
Gil, do you smoke weed you?

576
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,632
Well look at something.

577
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,926
- Take you too. Will he?
- Of course.

578
00:46:03,134 --> 00:46:05,429
Not for me, thank you.

579
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,392
Excuse me.

580
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,061
Come here.

581
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:15,398
Is it siirappihana?

582
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,651
Is. On its inside.

583
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:20,985
- Hey.
- Wait.

584
00:46:21,194 --> 00:46:23,406
Do not mess it up everywhere.

585
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,741
Did I should not smoke weed
in my own house?

586
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,200
Geez.

587
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,546
He is otherwise comfortable.

588
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:39,880
Really nice.

589
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:42,466
- Who?
- Andie.

590
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,510
So it is.

591
00:46:46,052 --> 00:46:48,263
That cheese is really good.

592
00:46:49,305 --> 00:46:52,768
Hard sheep's milk cheese from Holland.

593
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:56,229
It is so expensive,
the lobster is cheaper.

594
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:58,981
Excuse me. I take the rest back.

595
00:46:59,189 --> 00:47:01,275
No, no, please not.

596
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:07,239
Then we set out to juustonsyöjäksi, huh?

597
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,786
Clear.

598
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:25,382
Damn.

599
00:47:26,676 --> 00:47:28,427
Every time.

600
00:47:28,636 --> 00:47:30,638
You do this every time.

601
00:47:33,766 --> 00:47:34,893
Every single time.

602
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,644
I have not touched it in 15 years.

603
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:40,022
Whatever.
Teen about every single time.

604
00:47:46,571 --> 00:47:48,071
Damn.

605
00:48:03,962 --> 00:48:07,340
- Leave it alone.
- It's ready.

606
00:48:09,551 --> 00:48:12,596
What kind of real estate market
here is?

607
00:48:14,388 --> 00:48:15,641
What?

608
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:19,978
How to store it here?

609
00:48:24,065 --> 00:48:26,860
I do not use the house ever again.

610
00:48:27,611 --> 00:48:31,698
Its maintenance cost a fortune.
Mere taxes are property.

611
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:34,952
I was going to tell you.

612
00:48:36,494 --> 00:48:38,079
<I> You there! </i>

613
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:44,377
<I> What are you doing here in bed? </i>

614
00:48:44,586 --> 00:48:46,337
<I> It does not seem to do anything. </i>

615
00:48:46,547 --> 00:48:51,133
<I> Something strange is going on. </i>
There were just four beds.

616
00:48:51,342 --> 00:48:53,595
<I> - Come on ... </i>
- Them not get bored ever.

617
00:48:54,929 --> 00:48:57,890
It is in good condition. See what you want.

618
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,975
Where did you find it?

619
00:49:43,101 --> 00:49:45,478
It was lying in the corners.

620
00:49:47,857 --> 00:49:52,110
I invited him to burn with me.

621
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:54,194
He caught me.

622
00:49:54,779 --> 00:49:56,948
Feel free to do what you want.

623
00:49:57,782 --> 00:50:00,744
We had really nice.

624
00:50:00,952 --> 00:50:03,705
Everything was fine,
until you came and ...

625
00:50:03,913 --> 00:50:07,291
Excuse me,
that I interrupted you and your father's joy grip.

626
00:50:07,499 --> 00:50:09,501
Shove it.

627
00:50:14,173 --> 00:50:16,968
I do not understand,
why are you so dramatic.

628
00:50:21,388 --> 00:50:24,934
You got it nice scratch.

629
00:50:39,699 --> 00:50:41,533
Listen...

630
00:50:44,161 --> 00:50:50,376
I do not know how lucky you are,
that you got to be here.

631
00:50:50,583 --> 00:50:52,795
Your father brought you here to a minimum.

632
00:50:53,003 --> 00:50:58,884
Most people
do not get to experience that.

633
00:50:59,467 --> 00:51:03,429
As a small saw such places
only elokuvissa-

634
00:51:03,638 --> 00:51:05,891
- When on rare occasions
torsas money.

635
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:10,062
I know I know.
A poor childhood made you ärhäkän.

636
00:51:10,269 --> 00:51:13,189
No, I was taught to be
paapomatta people-

637
00:51:13,398 --> 00:51:16,275
- Which behaved
like spoiled brats.

638
00:51:41,342 --> 00:51:45,055
Excuse me. I just do not
seen you like this before.

639
00:51:48,766 --> 00:51:50,893
all families
are not as close as you.

640
00:51:51,102 --> 00:51:54,814
I am a weekend here
you and your family.

641
00:51:55,022 --> 00:51:57,775
What are you doing?
Do you care about me any?

642
00:51:57,984 --> 00:52:02,237
My mother and I have all the ...
more sense than you.

643
00:52:02,404 --> 00:52:04,322
Did anything happen?

644
00:52:05,615 --> 00:52:07,409
Did anything happen?

645
00:52:08,285 --> 00:52:10,204
He does not improve.

646
00:52:10,412 --> 00:52:12,456
It just is so.

647
00:52:16,418 --> 00:52:17,837
I know.

648
00:52:19,379 --> 00:52:21,631
Excuse me.

649
00:52:23,383 --> 00:52:27,429
My brother takes care of everything,
and I just ...

650
00:52:34,103 --> 00:52:36,230
I was thinking to go back.

651
00:52:36,438 --> 00:52:38,356
Of course, you go.

652
00:52:39,649 --> 00:52:43,863
Is work hard to get a vacation?
Do they not gonna admit it?

653
00:52:44,989 --> 00:52:50,119
No, I was thinking to move back.

654
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,376
So you change out.

655
00:53:02,421 --> 00:53:05,217
I do not know. Perhaps.

656
00:53:07,468 --> 00:53:09,221
Look at me.

657
00:53:11,597 --> 00:53:13,474
I'm not going to leave you.

658
00:53:14,142 --> 00:53:18,771
I mean only,
that I might leave.

659
00:53:25,987 --> 00:53:27,530
You can get involved.

660
00:53:28,865 --> 00:53:31,910
We could buy a big house halvalla-

661
00:53:32,118 --> 00:53:33,829
- Or stay in my brother's house.

662
00:53:34,037 --> 00:53:36,497
His dreams would come true.

663
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:44,797
He should be you,
if you got to know you better.

664
00:53:49,509 --> 00:53:52,179
I just started
with Pete's new album.

665
00:53:59,477 --> 00:54:01,105
I know.

666
00:54:28,132 --> 00:54:29,925
<I> I can not smoke weed in my own house. </i>

667
00:54:39,184 --> 00:54:43,147
You and Vicky therefore sell the place.

668
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,648
What do you do on weekends?

669
00:54:51,362 --> 00:54:52,863
I do not know.

670
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,618
But Vicky is sure to come up with,
how the money gets wasted.

671
00:54:59,786 --> 00:55:01,872
We rent the place.

672
00:55:03,249 --> 00:55:06,627
Private beach would be nice.

673
00:55:06,835 --> 00:55:08,545
If you can afford it.

674
00:55:11,465 --> 00:55:15,761
You'd be welcome to the village.

675
00:55:17,596 --> 00:55:19,848
Is this permanent?

676
00:55:24,895 --> 00:55:26,397
Is there anything permanent?

677
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:30,901
<I> Vicky! </i>

678
00:55:32,111 --> 00:55:33,363
<I> Vick! </i>

679
00:55:36,823 --> 00:55:39,077
Vicky!

680
00:55:39,285 --> 00:55:40,328
So?

681
00:55:40,535 --> 00:55:42,621
Where is the shampoo?

682
00:55:42,828 --> 00:55:44,957
In front of you on the left.

683
00:55:45,498 --> 00:55:46,707
I do not see it.

684
00:55:46,916 --> 00:55:49,127
Nothing. I found it.

685
00:55:49,336 --> 00:55:52,130
I like Andiesta.
He's a good catch, right?

686
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,216
Yup.

687
00:55:59,972 --> 00:56:02,598
How are you?
Are you still completely in the cloud?

688
00:56:02,807 --> 00:56:04,558
What?

689
00:56:04,767 --> 00:56:06,353
What did you say?

690
00:56:07,853 --> 00:56:10,065
Seth had earlier upset.

691
00:56:10,273 --> 00:56:13,567
You know Seth.
He is like that.

692
00:56:15,528 --> 00:56:17,863
You think you do not have
nothing to do with it.

693
00:56:18,073 --> 00:56:20,409
Why am I suddenly questioned?

694
00:56:21,784 --> 00:56:24,787
- It is not related to us.
- It is specific to us.

695
00:56:24,997 --> 00:56:26,539
Have you heard of respect?

696
00:56:27,416 --> 00:56:31,752
- Just like that song?
- There is now serious.

697
00:56:32,379 --> 00:56:34,297
You even told the sale of the house.

698
00:56:35,173 --> 00:56:37,342
- I was going to do it gradually.
- Look, Gil.

699
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:42,472
I'm too old for this.
Are we a family or not?

700
00:56:43,638 --> 00:56:46,058
I do not understand where this is going.

701
00:56:46,558 --> 00:56:48,394
We stayed here because you wanted to stay.

702
00:56:48,601 --> 00:56:52,689
I did not realize,
you'd be so defaulting.

703
00:56:52,897 --> 00:56:54,983
- The 'missing?
- Yes.

704
00:56:55,192 --> 00:56:59,363
I see. He is a little boy,
and I'm defaulting father.

705
00:56:59,571 --> 00:57:01,407
I do understand.

706
00:57:01,614 --> 00:57:04,659
It's no wonder,
that you're on his side.

707
00:57:04,868 --> 00:57:07,787
- Which side?
- "Which side?"

708
00:57:07,996 --> 00:57:09,664
No more questions.

709
00:57:09,873 --> 00:57:11,666
You are right.

710
00:57:11,875 --> 00:57:15,254
I'm going to sit here
and allows you to transfer the responsibility to ...

711
00:57:15,463 --> 00:57:18,424
... All the other buck.
- Stop the analysis.

712
00:57:18,631 --> 00:57:21,385
He is not 12 years old.
We're both adults.

713
00:57:21,593 --> 00:57:24,763
You're the father.
Behave accordingly.

714
00:57:35,357 --> 00:57:37,109
I signed up to the doctor.

715
00:57:39,236 --> 00:57:40,279
What?

716
00:57:46,867 --> 00:57:49,912
When?
Why did you do it without telling me?

717
00:57:51,331 --> 00:57:52,956
I'm telling you now.

718
00:57:53,166 --> 00:57:55,918
You decided the matter on their own.

719
00:57:57,128 --> 00:57:58,837
Somebody had to.

720
00:58:02,133 --> 00:58:04,302
Does this speak now?

721
00:58:05,803 --> 00:58:08,055
All this in the middle?

722
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:11,850
There is no time.

723
00:58:12,935 --> 00:58:14,562
Time's up.

724
00:58:15,813 --> 00:58:22,529
To tell the truth I do not know,
I can take care of one another.

725
00:58:22,736 --> 00:58:26,865
We take care of all together.

726
00:58:27,074 --> 00:58:28,243
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

727
00:58:28,451 --> 00:58:30,702
As you take care of me in the kayak?

728
00:58:30,911 --> 00:58:34,332
Or so as to take care of Seth,
when he was a small tree house?

729
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:36,543
- Seth and tree house ...
- He almost got pneumonia.

730
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:39,753
Did he tell the story
a tree house, and rhinitis?

731
00:58:39,961 --> 00:58:42,630
It is a classic story,
and you believed it.

732
00:59:09,324 --> 00:59:11,451
I want to do it with you.

733
00:59:15,663 --> 00:59:19,041
I know you want the same thing.
What worries you?

734
00:59:19,251 --> 00:59:22,171
- I do not want that it happens that way.
- How?

735
00:59:22,379 --> 00:59:24,130
Like you and Sethille.

736
00:59:25,299 --> 00:59:29,595
In this respect, can not be
later change their minds.

737
00:59:29,802 --> 00:59:32,639
My mind does not change.

738
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:38,270
- Are you sure?
- I am.

739
00:59:50,198 --> 00:59:54,159
As a child, he sat kivellä-

740
00:59:54,951 --> 00:59:57,996
- Practicing for hours.

741
00:59:59,956 --> 01:00:02,959
If he thought he was someone kuuntelevan-

742
01:00:04,127 --> 01:00:07,465
- As soon as he stopped and waited,
until I left.

743
01:00:15,348 --> 01:00:17,475
I do not want disturbed family.

744
01:00:17,683 --> 01:00:19,518
Me neither.

745
01:00:25,483 --> 01:00:27,984
- Are examined for ticks yourself?
- Berths?

746
01:00:28,402 --> 01:00:31,447
- I do not inspected.
- You do not like that.

747
01:00:32,113 --> 01:00:34,533
- Maybe I should check you in.
- Yes.

748
01:00:35,075 --> 01:00:36,993
I know what you're going to start.

749
01:00:41,914 --> 01:00:43,291
In.

750
01:00:46,628 --> 01:00:49,129
The next train leaves
30 minutes to get to.

751
01:00:49,339 --> 01:00:53,968
Good. Thanks for the information.

752
01:00:58,013 --> 01:00:59,432
Are you okay?

753
01:00:59,641 --> 01:01:01,058
I am.

754
01:01:02,142 --> 01:01:04,604
There is nothing to this.

755
01:01:05,187 --> 01:01:07,274
Everything happens at the same time.

756
01:01:09,191 --> 01:01:11,319
It seems that I step on everyone's toes.

757
01:01:11,528 --> 01:01:16,533
I'm supposed to leave today.

758
01:01:17,866 --> 01:01:21,538
I said Gilille fully samaa-

759
01:01:23,205 --> 01:01:25,833
- About a quarter of an hour ago.

760
01:01:26,959 --> 01:01:29,086
Geniuses think the same.

761
01:01:31,715 --> 01:01:33,007
Hey.

762
01:01:50,691 --> 01:01:53,276
- Vicky?
- Yes.

763
01:01:53,485 --> 01:01:56,863
- Have you seen laturiani?
- That's it, you left it.

764
01:01:57,071 --> 01:02:00,492
There you are.
Have you seen laturiani?

765
01:02:00,701 --> 01:02:02,118
- Did you transfer it?
- I do not.

766
01:02:02,328 --> 01:02:05,163
- Then that's it, where you left it.
- It's not there.

767
01:02:05,497 --> 01:02:07,915
- I moved it.
- Alright.

768
01:02:09,501 --> 01:02:13,129
I found this. It is not Vicky,
so it is probably you.

769
01:02:14,005 --> 01:02:16,215
Thank you. I'm looking for it.

770
01:02:17,634 --> 01:02:21,012
- Search your charger.
- I did not touch it.

771
01:02:22,055 --> 01:02:23,640
What's this?

772
01:02:24,223 --> 01:02:26,142
This way when you hid it.

773
01:02:26,352 --> 01:02:27,644
You know what it is.

774
01:02:29,355 --> 01:02:30,938
Tell me.

775
01:02:36,736 --> 01:02:41,574
Did you go back to
necklace circulation 7th Avenue?

776
01:02:44,993 --> 01:02:46,995
It's plain silver.

777
01:02:47,204 --> 01:02:48,664
It is looked at.

778
01:02:49,956 --> 01:02:52,377
You brought me here because of it.

779
01:02:56,296 --> 01:02:59,132
- It does not matter anymore.
- Of course it is.

780
01:03:00,133 --> 01:03:01,511
- I can restore it.
- No, you can not.

781
01:03:01,719 --> 01:03:03,471
- Why not?
- As engraved on it ...

782
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:05,598
... A funny, poetic message.

783
01:03:05,807 --> 01:03:07,307
How do you know?

784
01:03:08,892 --> 01:03:11,228
That's what you do with it.

785
01:03:28,454 --> 01:03:31,791
I want ... Can I see it?

786
01:03:32,833 --> 01:03:34,543
Only if you want to buy it.

787
01:03:40,172 --> 01:03:41,842
I do not know.

788
01:03:46,178 --> 01:03:47,681
Then do not.

789
01:04:06,365 --> 01:04:09,201
I do not even know what this means.

790
01:04:10,244 --> 01:04:15,500
If you want to ride,
we should go.

791
01:04:28,345 --> 01:04:31,933
I think I'll stay after all.

792
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:33,684
Good.

793
01:04:58,501 --> 01:05:01,461
Did you think I really
leave you to single-

794
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:05,633
- So that you could mill around in self-pity
and blame me?

795
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:09,512
Before long, it happens.

796
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:13,849
That I can not say anything.

797
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:17,477
But this will not happen today.

798
01:05:36,621 --> 01:05:40,542
I do not understand why we do this.
They are guaranteed to like it.

799
01:05:43,418 --> 01:05:44,671
- Damn it.
- What?

800
01:05:44,879 --> 01:05:48,173
- I got a wound. The knife is really sharp.
- Are you okay?

801
01:05:48,382 --> 01:05:51,301
Yes. Can you survive on your own for a moment?
I'll handle this.

802
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:54,096
- How serious is it? Show.
- I'll just clean it mass.

803
01:06:01,436 --> 01:06:04,691
- Gil, are you there?
- I am.

804
01:06:05,065 --> 01:06:07,401
What now?

805
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:09,111
Sorry to interrupt.

806
01:06:09,319 --> 01:06:11,196
- I cut my finger off.
- What?

807
01:06:11,405 --> 01:06:13,783
- I ...
- Are you okay?

808
01:06:13,992 --> 01:06:16,451
- Clean it up?
- I make it a point.

809
01:06:16,661 --> 01:06:21,833
The kitchen is a critical step on,
I do not feel no good.

810
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:27,589
Could you please come and help her?

811
01:06:27,797 --> 01:06:30,049
- What?
- Yes.

812
01:06:31,132 --> 01:06:32,884
Vegan Foods What do I know?

813
01:06:33,092 --> 01:06:35,511
Do not worry. He will tell you what to do.

814
01:06:54,990 --> 01:06:56,992
Andie said that you need help.

815
01:06:57,199 --> 01:06:58,409
Where is he?

816
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:01,747
He received a wound
and sent me to fill in for.

817
01:07:05,207 --> 01:07:10,005
Alright.
Can you look at that grill is on?

818
01:07:10,212 --> 01:07:12,633
- You got it, sir.
- Thank you.

819
01:07:18,096 --> 01:07:19,681
Andie?

820
01:07:20,766 --> 01:07:22,558
Damn.

821
01:07:25,144 --> 01:07:26,897
Huusitko something?

822
01:07:28,105 --> 01:07:29,522
I do not.

823
01:07:31,108 --> 01:07:34,444
- Everything is ready.
- Thank you.

824
01:07:35,403 --> 01:07:36,781
What do these have to do?

825
01:07:36,989 --> 01:07:40,076
They must be cut longitudinally,
no slices.

826
01:07:58,343 --> 01:07:59,636
Good.

827
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:02,305
What is on the menu?

828
01:08:02,514 --> 01:08:04,892
A couple of different stories.

829
01:08:05,101 --> 01:08:10,397
This is an Indian lentil dalia,
plus...

830
01:08:20,783 --> 01:08:23,828
That is what is on the menu?

831
01:08:24,619 --> 01:08:26,914
That's the lentils and tomatoes.

832
01:08:27,122 --> 01:08:29,833
There are also other vegetables,
and you will help tekemään-

833
01:08:30,041 --> 01:08:32,543
- Ratatouille spiritual vegetarian food.

834
01:08:32,752 --> 01:08:33,962
Is that what I put?

835
01:08:34,628 --> 01:08:37,297
You just grilling the vegetables,
to be added to myöhemmin-

836
01:08:37,506 --> 01:08:40,969
- But they have a better grilling first.

837
01:08:42,594 --> 01:08:46,015
Did you learn all this in restaurants?

838
01:08:47,058 --> 01:08:48,350
I learned.

839
01:08:49,853 --> 01:08:53,189
- Did you like it?
- I hated it. It was horrible.

840
01:08:53,397 --> 01:08:55,315
I can imagine.

841
01:08:55,524 --> 01:08:58,277
Fortunately, you do not need
do it anymore.

842
01:08:58,903 --> 01:09:00,487
I will do.

843
01:09:00,696 --> 01:09:04,200
I'll sometimes shifts,
while doing rigorous.

844
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:28,016
Seth, this is very impressive.

845
01:09:28,223 --> 01:09:31,018
- Gil agrees.
- Gil agrees.

846
01:09:31,226 --> 01:09:36,439
It is organic quinoa,
fried tofu, corn, coriander.

847
01:09:36,647 --> 01:09:38,649
No animals or additives.

848
01:09:39,234 --> 01:09:41,611
- It is one of Seth's nimikkoaterioista.
- I know.

849
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:43,488
I helped in cooking.

850
01:09:43,696 --> 01:09:46,992
We increased the dose of your
extra butter.

851
01:09:47,201 --> 01:09:49,953
Excuse me. Excuse me.

852
01:09:50,829 --> 01:09:53,081
Excuse me. I clean it.

853
01:10:04,259 --> 01:10:06,220
I have a question.

854
01:10:06,427 --> 01:10:09,722
What is the "race" mean?
Hoitte it in the past.

855
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:15,813
We were Housatonic River, is not it?
It is a fourth-class river.

856
01:10:16,188 --> 01:10:19,690
- It was no more than second class.
- It was what was, it was big.

857
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:23,361
Seth made the turn,
and then I, and then the tail

858
01:10:23,569 --> 01:10:25,864
- And then I will again.
At some point, Seth said:

859
01:10:26,072 --> 01:10:27,781
"It's like translation contest."

860
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:31,493
Now, as they say
After each turn.

861
01:10:31,701 --> 01:10:34,329
- "Race."
- It infuriated my sister.

862
01:10:34,538 --> 01:10:36,456
- He was jealous of the boys.
- Here we go again.

863
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:40,086
It is interesting.
I read one artikkelin-

864
01:10:40,294 --> 01:10:42,213
- In which evolutionary biologists
was the theory siitä-

865
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:45,007
- Why men tend to
prefer sports.

866
01:10:45,216 --> 01:10:47,676
<I> He says </i>
Biology articles Maxim.

867
01:10:47,885 --> 01:10:50,179
- But it is interesting.
- What's it say?

868
01:10:50,387 --> 01:10:55,350
The article says that men and women
brains have evolved in different fashion--

869
01:10:55,559 --> 01:10:57,895
- And that it stems from the
hunting-collector-time.

870
01:10:58,312 --> 01:11:03,985
Men are much more
the status of realizing demanding toimista-

871
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:09,364
- Such as throwing a spear,
and now throwing the ball.

872
01:11:09,781 --> 01:11:14,245
They had to assess the state of
and hit the target at the right moment.

873
01:11:14,452 --> 01:11:19,208
Women, in turn, are able to
find tomato jääkaapista-

874
01:11:19,416 --> 01:11:21,252
- Because we are collectors.

875
01:11:23,128 --> 01:11:25,671
- Fully makes sense.
- Maybe our brains really ...

876
01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:29,009
... Are different,
because all men are of the opinion.

877
01:11:29,217 --> 01:11:31,635
No. Really, Seth?

878
01:11:31,844 --> 01:11:34,890
Seth argues that women
do not know how to enter protected from the wind.

879
01:11:35,472 --> 01:11:38,310
- What?
- I did not say anything.

880
01:11:40,686 --> 01:11:43,148
- Gold ...
- Put it in song.

881
01:11:43,356 --> 01:11:44,648
I saw you today.

882
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:50,487
Call your song new to them.
It's really good.

883
01:11:50,696 --> 01:11:53,950
I have not even discussed it yet.

884
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:56,619
Now is a good opportunity.

885
01:11:56,827 --> 01:12:02,334
If it suits you, maybe we can get
a private concert after food.

886
01:12:02,541 --> 01:12:07,088
I do not know. I just have a guitar ...

887
01:12:07,297 --> 01:12:09,882
<I> I read the review The Voice. </i>

888
01:12:11,343 --> 01:12:14,054
- Oh, really?
- Your father showed it to me.

889
01:12:16,973 --> 01:12:18,891
It was well written.

890
01:12:20,393 --> 01:12:22,853
He was like,
testimony swanky little boy.

891
01:12:33,072 --> 01:12:35,657
When I come tomorrow back-

892
01:12:35,865 --> 01:12:39,577
- I'll take you there,
and we can choose for you a new one.

893
01:12:39,786 --> 01:12:41,746
What you want.

894
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:44,166
Is that okay?

895
01:12:44,375 --> 01:12:48,170
Time to go to bed.
I give the phone to your mother.

896
01:12:48,836 --> 01:12:50,588
Good night, kid.

897
01:12:51,547 --> 01:12:53,384
Hey honey.

898
01:12:53,591 --> 01:12:56,844
No, no, no computer games.

899
01:12:57,054 --> 01:12:59,098
You are dear. Go to sleep now.

900
01:13:27,958 --> 01:13:32,422
Gil told me to open this.

901
01:13:34,007 --> 01:13:35,590
Gil.

902
01:13:40,846 --> 01:13:43,182
Why should I call him?

903
01:14:02,617 --> 01:14:05,579
What are you doing?

904
01:14:06,372 --> 01:14:09,083
I can put wood in order upon the fire.

905
01:14:09,292 --> 01:14:11,044
Wait now.

906
01:14:11,668 --> 01:14:13,212
Damn, I'm sorry.

907
01:14:14,004 --> 01:14:17,091
- No worries.
- Are you okay?

908
01:14:19,259 --> 01:14:21,428
Wait a minute. Where is your wound?

909
01:14:22,595 --> 01:14:25,223
Maybe it's improved.

910
01:14:33,731 --> 01:14:36,859
- I should not have brought you here.
- Bye.

911
01:14:39,612 --> 01:14:41,655
How can I trust you?

912
01:14:47,828 --> 01:14:50,248
You relied on before.

913
01:14:51,249 --> 01:14:55,295
Seth, is there a concert?

914
01:15:07,432 --> 01:15:10,768
Can you hold this? I go to the restroom.

915
01:15:15,731 --> 01:15:17,275
Is everything okay?

916
01:15:18,066 --> 01:15:19,901
Is.

917
01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:23,988
Is.

918
01:15:24,532 --> 01:15:25,740
Do you want some wine?

919
01:15:25,949 --> 01:15:28,868
- No thanks.
- It has already been cleared.

920
01:15:33,957 --> 01:15:36,835
There is really cold at night.

921
01:15:37,669 --> 01:15:39,629
Fire is for it.

922
01:15:40,256 --> 01:15:42,550
Can you increase the heat?

923
01:15:43,758 --> 01:15:47,221
Come here.
This is hotter.

924
01:15:58,524 --> 01:16:00,066
Is it better?

925
01:16:00,276 --> 01:16:04,530
- Is it possible that the air is colder?
- Are you always this persnickety?

926
01:16:04,737 --> 01:16:06,198
I do not.

927
01:16:23,755 --> 01:16:28,886
I get upset so airy spaces.

928
01:16:36,352 --> 01:16:39,439
City tricking people to believe,
that we are not alone.

929
01:16:40,898 --> 01:16:42,691
We are not alone.

930
01:16:56,414 --> 01:16:58,081
What do you want?

931
01:16:59,209 --> 01:17:00,834
How come?

932
01:17:01,043 --> 01:17:06,882
Will you let him fuck you,
so that he will help your child elätyksessä?

933
01:17:25,567 --> 01:17:26,943
Hell.

934
01:17:52,302 --> 01:17:55,846
- Do you drink?
- I hold it only.

935
01:17:56,055 --> 01:17:58,224
Your breath smells of wine.

936
01:17:58,849 --> 01:18:01,478
I can drink
if I want a glass of wine.

937
01:19:38,864 --> 01:19:40,367
Hold this.

938
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:47,206
Old woman did not like the fact that I eat this.

939
01:19:47,915 --> 01:19:49,626
It will be a spare tire.

940
01:19:49,834 --> 01:19:51,043
So you eat in secret?

941
01:19:51,251 --> 01:19:53,797
spoon by
you promise not to tell him.

942
01:19:54,004 --> 01:19:55,923
- I will not tell.
- What is the password?

943
01:19:56,131 --> 01:19:58,175
- Really?
- The password.

944
01:19:58,385 --> 01:20:00,637
- Are you going to do?
- Password?

945
01:20:00,845 --> 01:20:03,431
- Swordfish.
- Good man.

946
01:20:09,521 --> 01:20:13,190
Do you remember that kulmapuodin,
the ice cream place?

947
01:20:13,399 --> 01:20:14,525
I remember.

948
01:20:15,484 --> 01:20:22,323
You will not find any kind of ice cream
throughout the rest of your life.

949
01:20:26,953 --> 01:20:29,873
- I forgot insecticide.
- Here.

950
01:20:30,624 --> 01:20:32,835
Try it. It is the Andes.

951
01:20:34,335 --> 01:20:35,629
Oh God.

952
01:20:35,838 --> 01:20:37,964
organic
garlic and black pepper?

953
01:20:38,172 --> 01:20:42,051
Tehoaako it also vampire of?
I'll take the risk.

954
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:45,012
Guess that will help?
When standing next to the woman.

955
01:20:45,221 --> 01:20:46,890
- What?
- I do not know why.

956
01:20:47,098 --> 01:20:49,518
Their blood is different.
Women are like sticky flypaper.

957
01:20:49,726 --> 01:20:53,938
- Have you noticed?
- Andie always complain itikanpuremista.

958
01:20:54,147 --> 01:20:55,566
- I'll get bites just alone.
- Do you see?

959
01:20:55,774 --> 01:20:59,445
Point it is a heterosexual
with respect to the only good thing.

960
01:21:10,413 --> 01:21:12,957
I like the way a lot of Andiesta.

961
01:21:14,082 --> 01:21:15,543
So do I.

962
01:21:16,418 --> 01:21:18,128
Do you Vickystä?

963
01:21:19,129 --> 01:21:20,422
I like.

964
01:21:21,507 --> 01:21:22,966
But?

965
01:21:25,511 --> 01:21:27,012
Nothing.

966
01:21:30,766 --> 01:21:32,894
We are considering getting married.

967
01:21:33,769 --> 01:21:35,228
Lhan true?

968
01:21:36,898 --> 01:21:38,900
It is otherwise -97 Barolo.

969
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:48,116
How old is his son?

970
01:21:54,331 --> 01:21:55,917
Eight.

971
01:21:56,333 --> 01:21:58,001
Who is the father?

972
01:21:58,669 --> 01:22:01,797
Not me.
Someone doctor. You do not know him.

973
01:22:02,673 --> 01:22:05,008
- Do you like him?
- Lapsestako?

974
01:22:07,762 --> 01:22:09,680
He is a nice boy.

975
01:22:10,179 --> 01:22:11,556
Well...

976
01:22:13,307 --> 01:22:14,935
...congratulations.

977
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:24,193
Where is he this weekend?

978
01:22:24,401 --> 01:22:26,821
Jake has his father's house.

979
01:22:27,029 --> 01:22:29,448
Lhan crazy. I mean, not ...

980
01:22:31,283 --> 01:22:33,327
It's not crazy, but ...

981
01:22:33,828 --> 01:22:36,372
I never would have guessed.

982
01:22:36,581 --> 01:22:40,669
I was younger than you when I got him.

983
01:22:42,587 --> 01:22:44,338
Would it be awful?

984
01:22:45,966 --> 01:22:50,094
Is it weird if I ask,
what happened to the marriage?

985
01:22:51,136 --> 01:22:52,471
No.

986
01:22:53,014 --> 01:22:55,474
What happened,
what did not happen ...

987
01:22:56,851 --> 01:22:59,729
Would you like a professional
or personal opinion?

988
01:23:01,355 --> 01:23:03,315
Professional.

989
01:23:04,568 --> 01:23:06,235
Alright.

990
01:23:09,613 --> 01:23:11,031
Where to start?

991
01:23:13,366 --> 01:23:15,911
Michael and I ...

992
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:19,455
We were so in love.

993
01:23:20,666 --> 01:23:25,461
We thought we were strong
and we decided to have a baby.

994
01:23:26,922 --> 01:23:30,801
Starting a family is amazing.

995
01:23:33,596 --> 01:23:34,930
But to create space.

996
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:39,434
Space must be created literally.

997
01:23:40,310 --> 01:23:43,939
Suddenly, in the same bed
sleeps a new little person.

998
01:23:44,147 --> 01:23:48,234
- Like with a new lover.
- It sounds like Seth's dream.

999
01:23:48,443 --> 01:23:50,486
It can be wonderful.

1000
01:23:52,948 --> 01:23:55,408
But with so many things will change.

1001
01:23:57,077 --> 01:23:59,495
It can not be predicted
before income children.

1002
01:24:01,289 --> 01:24:02,958
For example...

1003
01:24:05,085 --> 01:24:10,298
To each other is no longer possible
love just as much.

1004
01:24:11,298 --> 01:24:14,969
It is as if love be divided into sections.

1005
01:24:19,015 --> 01:24:21,684
We did not prepare for it.

1006
01:24:24,144 --> 01:24:25,688
I think that...

1007
01:24:28,066 --> 01:24:34,404
... We could not accept,
that part of our relationship died.

1008
01:24:41,495 --> 01:24:45,833
This was followed by grudges, and ...
Well, you realize yes.

1009
01:24:49,087 --> 01:24:51,714
- It is therefore a professional opinion.
- That's right.

1010
01:24:55,175 --> 01:24:56,593
What about a personal opinion?

1011
01:24:56,803 --> 01:24:58,805
He was the son of a bitch.

1012
01:25:00,472 --> 01:25:03,017
For real. One morning-

1013
01:25:03,225 --> 01:25:06,729
- He turned to the bed and said:
"I'm not ready for this."

1014
01:25:07,938 --> 01:25:10,857
- What?
- Yes.

1015
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:16,905
We already have a son.
What should be prepared?

1016
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:24,412
Excuse me. I did not mean...

1017
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:27,498
You do not leave me.

1018
01:25:29,835 --> 01:25:31,753
Did you choose an older male

1019
01:25:31,962 --> 01:25:35,631
- Because he has already experienced
midlife crisis?

1020
01:25:36,967 --> 01:25:39,677
I think I'll be in his mid-life crisis.

1021
01:25:39,886 --> 01:25:41,262
Too late to regret.

1022
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:45,851
I have not thought about it that way.

1023
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:51,106
Exactly this...

1024
01:26:00,198 --> 01:26:03,409
Do you sell the house in order to
Vickystä care and child?

1025
01:26:06,536 --> 01:26:08,038
It's not that simple.

1026
01:26:08,246 --> 01:26:11,708
Do you go on holiday,
you pay for tennis lessons ...

1027
01:26:15,755 --> 01:26:18,506
You never redeem uploaded on checks.

1028
01:26:18,715 --> 01:26:20,176
I do not need your money.

1029
01:26:20,383 --> 01:26:23,179
Paid for their university.

1030
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:28,934
Are you trying to make up for it now?

1031
01:26:29,143 --> 01:26:32,604
- Credit for what?
- The fate of the first family.

1032
01:26:34,272 --> 01:26:36,776
Why would you say about me?

1033
01:26:36,984 --> 01:26:38,276
What should I say?

1034
01:26:38,485 --> 01:26:40,278
You sound just like your mother.

1035
01:26:40,487 --> 01:26:44,200
I am sick to death
continuous criticism.

1036
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:49,454
I just want to enjoy the rest of my life.

1037
01:26:49,662 --> 01:26:52,332
Why can not you be happy for me?

1038
01:26:57,004 --> 01:26:59,589
The family did not have any space.

1039
01:27:01,842 --> 01:27:04,469
with Vicky I am different.

1040
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:09,515
I can relax and enjoy olostani.
He listens to me.

1041
01:27:09,723 --> 01:27:15,104
Between us has not had time to accumulate
mistakes and guilt.

1042
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:20,692
Why this need to talk?
We had so nice.

1043
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:22,821
We have never talked so much.

1044
01:27:23,029 --> 01:27:25,198
It's probably the reason.

1045
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:29,035
You understand, then,
when you have children.

1046
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:31,453
I understand what?

1047
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:35,791
Everything can not speak.

1048
01:27:50,806 --> 01:27:52,100
If ever I could get lapsia-

1049
01:27:52,308 --> 01:27:55,270
- I would have done this winter
ice hockey rink.

1050
01:28:02,317 --> 01:28:04,278
It would have been a good idea.

1051
01:28:05,153 --> 01:28:07,155
You said that the place would always be here.

1052
01:28:07,865 --> 01:28:11,285
I know. It was a long time ago.

1053
01:28:12,577 --> 01:28:14,204
Things are changing.

1054
01:28:14,412 --> 01:28:17,040
I have to take other people into account.

1055
01:28:23,171 --> 01:28:27,301
Is there a different matter to say nothing,
because there is nothing to say ...

1056
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:32,638
... And not to say anything ...

1057
01:28:36,767 --> 01:28:38,603
... Because there is too much to say?

1058
01:28:57,956 --> 01:29:00,083
Oh God.

1059
01:29:00,292 --> 01:29:01,709
Oh God.

1060
01:29:01,918 --> 01:29:03,085
- What now?
- What happened?

1061
01:29:03,294 --> 01:29:05,004
- He saw something.
- What did you see?

1062
01:29:05,212 --> 01:29:07,714
I do not know.
I only saw a little bit, but it was big.

1063
01:29:07,924 --> 01:29:10,592
- Where were you?
- He applied for a glass of water inside.

1064
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:13,054
Talossako?
Did you see something for sure?

1065
01:29:13,262 --> 01:29:15,097
What's wrong with you?
We are in danger.

1066
01:29:15,306 --> 01:29:16,390
You said it was in the house.

1067
01:29:16,598 --> 01:29:18,516
What if it came out
or if there are more?

1068
01:29:18,725 --> 01:29:19,893
It's probably a raccoon.

1069
01:29:20,102 --> 01:29:21,686
Are you going to leave me here?

1070
01:29:21,895 --> 01:29:23,230
Come on.

1071
01:29:28,693 --> 01:29:30,528
- I hear something.
- They kusettavat us.

1072
01:29:30,737 --> 01:29:33,199
- And we do not bullshit!
- It's just a raccoon.

1073
01:29:33,407 --> 01:29:35,867
It's not a raccoon.

1074
01:29:48,922 --> 01:29:51,133
- It's just a raccoon.
- Is not...

1075
01:29:51,342 --> 01:29:53,593
- Holy shit.
- Holy shit.

1076
01:29:53,802 --> 01:29:55,262
Great!

1077
01:29:55,470 --> 01:29:57,223
Oh God...

1078
01:29:57,431 --> 01:30:01,559
- It messes up the place.
- Gil, our house is a bear.

1079
01:30:01,767 --> 01:30:05,479
- What do we do now?
- We can not do anything.

1080
01:30:08,233 --> 01:30:10,651
- What?
- I do not know.

1081
01:30:13,071 --> 01:30:15,073
Do not discharge into the lamp.

1082
01:30:15,281 --> 01:30:16,324
Oh God.

1083
01:30:16,532 --> 01:30:18,742
It's probably afraid of us
more than we do it.

1084
01:30:18,951 --> 01:30:21,454
- It is not possible to.
- Where did it go?

1085
01:30:22,330 --> 01:30:25,083
Did it come out?
Gil, do not you have a gun?

1086
01:30:25,291 --> 01:30:28,420
I am a member of the Nature Conservation Agency.

1087
01:30:28,627 --> 01:30:31,006
- Can you call someone?
- My phone is inside.

1088
01:30:31,214 --> 01:30:33,216
- What do we do then?
- Be at peace!

1089
01:30:34,508 --> 01:30:36,177
Be pretty in peace.

1090
01:30:36,386 --> 01:30:38,471
Let's take a look at the other side.

1091
01:30:38,679 --> 01:30:41,682
No worries. Stay calm.

1092
01:30:43,059 --> 01:30:44,518
Come on.

1093
01:30:46,812 --> 01:30:48,189
Come now.

1094
01:30:57,365 --> 01:31:00,659
Are we trying to attach it to your attention?

1095
01:31:00,867 --> 01:31:03,619
- Calm down.
- Completely absurd.

1096
01:31:14,881 --> 01:31:16,758
What are you going to do?

1097
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:30,813
It splashed on a wooden floor.

1098
01:31:31,022 --> 01:31:32,815
Is it oil?

1099
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,568
It is organic,
cold pressed ...

1100
01:31:35,777 --> 01:31:37,820
- unprocessed
extra-virgin olive oil.

1101
01:31:38,029 --> 01:31:40,115
What the hell does that mean?

1102
01:31:40,324 --> 01:31:42,617
- The fact that it is environmentally friendly.
- The devil.

1103
01:31:43,118 --> 01:31:44,495
The floors must not go to pot.

1104
01:31:44,702 --> 01:31:46,037
- Come on, Gil.
- What?

1105
01:31:46,246 --> 01:31:47,955
- Concentrate.
- What?

1106
01:31:48,165 --> 01:31:49,749
To protect me and the baby.

1107
01:32:01,009 --> 01:32:02,386
It...

1108
01:32:03,429 --> 01:32:05,306
... Is still in its infancy.

1109
01:32:06,474 --> 01:32:08,850
I did not want to tell in this way.

1110
01:32:09,059 --> 01:32:12,313
- Are there any other children, of whom I do not know?
- Of course not.

1111
01:32:12,522 --> 01:32:15,233
We have not told anyone.

1112
01:32:15,441 --> 01:32:18,486
You can play thirties
as much as your soul to put up with.

1113
01:32:18,693 --> 01:32:21,947
To obtain
a new house, a wife and a son.

1114
01:32:22,156 --> 01:32:24,325
I can not get a new father.
Wish I could.

1115
01:32:25,368 --> 01:32:27,495
Guess how many times I
tried to call you?

1116
01:32:27,702 --> 01:32:31,623
How many Meilian I have left
sending, because you would be?

1117
01:32:32,916 --> 01:32:35,545
It did not happen only to you.
Do I have supposedly been easy?

1118
01:32:35,752 --> 01:32:39,298
What crap.
You've never tried to fix things.

1119
01:32:39,507 --> 01:32:40,674
What would be enough?

1120
01:32:40,882 --> 01:32:44,719
Nothing.
Nothing is ever enough for you.

1121
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:46,680
We both did our choices.

1122
01:32:46,888 --> 01:32:48,849
You did not choose me,
and I am you.

1123
01:32:49,057 --> 01:32:51,269
Maybe it was a mistake, maybe not.

1124
01:32:52,936 --> 01:32:54,771
Shit,
I go out to scare the bear.

1125
01:32:54,980 --> 01:32:57,358
It is responsible,
when you're about to get a baby.

1126
01:32:57,566 --> 01:32:59,317
Do not berate the sense of responsibility.

1127
01:32:59,526 --> 01:33:02,279
- Because of you bear is in the house.
- How come?

1128
01:33:02,487 --> 01:33:06,491
Junk Box is not for it,
that you can throw debris on the ground.

1129
01:33:06,699 --> 01:33:09,034
- The same as if you called it.
- Debris were all over the place when we arrived.

1130
01:33:09,244 --> 01:33:11,787
- I cleaned them.
- And if it was the tooth fairy ...

1131
01:33:11,996 --> 01:33:14,583
... Who left the towels on the floor?
- What difference does it make?

1132
01:33:14,790 --> 01:33:17,377
The house has in any case been sold.
Why did not it would mess up?

1133
01:33:17,586 --> 01:33:21,173
Why do you care? You do not even go here.
You wait for me to die, so that perisit it.

1134
01:33:21,381 --> 01:33:23,508
I come here often.
In most cases, I make sure ...

1135
01:33:23,716 --> 01:33:27,179
... I did not crash into you.
- Come on be childish.

1136
01:33:27,387 --> 01:33:31,516
Do not interfere in the matter.
We do not need your help.

1137
01:33:31,724 --> 01:33:34,852
- That was a flow of 320 bucks.
- Gil.

1138
01:33:35,228 --> 01:33:36,354
- What?
- Do something.

1139
01:33:36,563 --> 01:33:39,482
If you're so damn baby
Worry, why do you drink wine?

1140
01:33:39,649 --> 01:33:43,278
- It is due to spill syrup.
- He spilled it.

1141
01:33:43,486 --> 01:33:45,322
- Whose side are you on?
- There's no sides.

1142
01:33:45,530 --> 01:33:48,115
- Stay out of it.
- Do not talk to him about.

1143
01:33:48,325 --> 01:33:50,327
- This is not his family.
- Now is.

1144
01:33:50,535 --> 01:33:52,828
- Be quiet!
- Enough already!

1145
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:41,226
What are you doing here?

1146
01:35:45,939 --> 01:35:47,567
I look around.

1147
01:35:49,234 --> 01:35:51,321
It has survived pretty well.

1148
01:35:57,825 --> 01:36:00,746
Why did you come here this weekend?

1149
01:36:02,414 --> 01:36:03,998
I...

1150
01:36:07,877 --> 01:36:11,673
I wanted to talk Andielle
getting married.

1151
01:36:15,385 --> 01:36:17,094
Then I came to ...

1152
01:36:19,723 --> 01:36:21,433
... And ruined huvinne.

1153
01:36:25,311 --> 01:36:28,314
This time I can not blame you.

1154
01:36:32,026 --> 01:36:33,653
I see.

1155
01:36:35,781 --> 01:36:37,239
Yes, you probably ...

1156
01:36:39,116 --> 01:36:40,660
... You come up with something.

1157
01:36:45,289 --> 01:36:48,668
There is no reason to hurry.
You have time.

1158
01:36:49,461 --> 01:36:54,424
I wish someone would have told
it to me at your age.

1159
01:36:56,257 --> 01:36:58,051
It just goes on and on.

1160
01:37:08,813 --> 01:37:10,897
Be careful where you step.

1161
01:38:22,635 --> 01:38:25,555
Gil, thank you for this.
It was nice to meet you.

1162
01:38:27,222 --> 01:38:31,143
- Similarly you.
- Thank you.

1163
01:38:32,729 --> 01:38:35,815
Seth, it was nice to finally meet you.

1164
01:38:36,023 --> 01:38:37,316
- Yes.
- And spend time together.

1165
01:38:38,275 --> 01:38:39,736
So was.

1166
01:38:42,112 --> 01:38:43,656
Well.

1167
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:47,159
Here.

1168
01:38:47,367 --> 01:38:48,953
Take the gas money.

1169
01:38:52,455 --> 01:38:54,541
I do not need money.

1170
01:38:56,083 --> 01:38:57,669
I'll give you gas money.

1171
01:38:59,713 --> 01:39:00,881
I do not need that.

1172
01:39:01,464 --> 01:39:04,718
I know, but I will give it to you.

1173
01:39:17,564 --> 01:39:19,023
Thank you.
