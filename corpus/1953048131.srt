1
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:15,415
Colony Collapse Disorder
is the bill we're getting,

2
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,715
for all we have done to the bees.

3
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:31,119
It's just a name that was given to a
phenomenon that a hive is found empty.

4
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:36,129
Food is there, honey is there,
but the bees are gone.

5
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,844
The first thing we look for is
- who is the cause for that?

6
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:48,440
Who is responsible?

7
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:54,521
We are not going to solve
the problem by us killing

8
00:02:54,556 --> 00:02:58,123
a virus or bacteria or fungi,

9
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,117
because the problem is an inner one.

10
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:09,434
Personally, I am grateful for a crisis,

11
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:14,741
the crisis will give us the
possibility to learn something

12
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:18,743
if we are willing.

13
00:03:18,778 --> 00:03:24,774
If the heart opens up enough
to tell the mind something.

14
00:03:39,132 --> 00:03:41,951
If we didn't have bees to
pollinate our crops, you know,

15
00:03:41,986 --> 00:03:44,771
we'd have to eat just bread
and oatmeal all the time,

16
00:03:44,806 --> 00:03:46,500
and a couple of nuts!

17
00:04:11,565 --> 00:04:13,533
The honeybee is important because

18
00:04:16,937 --> 00:04:19,104
a tremendous amount of what we eat.

19
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,475
So that's to say 4 of every 10
bites of food you consume,

20
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:27,812
you would not consume if not
for the work of the honeybee.

21
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:40,160
We have lost in this country alone, in
America, about five million colonies

22
00:04:40,195 --> 00:04:48,158
each one of them having 20 to 50, 60
thousand individual honeybees.

23
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:52,972
The bees are always telling
us all kinds of things

24
00:04:53,007 --> 00:04:56,776
that we have to learn, they
are giving us messages

25
00:04:56,811 --> 00:05:00,177
and their crisis is our crisis definitely.

26
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:07,179
We could call it Colony Collapse
Disorder of the human being too.

27
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:20,012
The honeybee was
considered a sacred animal.

28
00:07:20,453 --> 00:07:26,426
And the sacredness came out of
that knowledge that the honeybee

29
00:07:26,461 --> 00:07:31,762
is one of the great
nurturers of life and fertility.

30
00:07:46,146 --> 00:07:51,750
The honeybee came out
of the mystery centers.

31
00:07:51,785 --> 00:07:57,155
Places where there were
initiates and leaders of mankind

32
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:04,221
who guided and impulsed and inspired
the various civilizations that we have.

33
00:08:05,398 --> 00:08:07,366
The ancient Indian,

34
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:10,959
the ancient Persian,

35
00:08:11,437 --> 00:08:15,373
the Greco-Roman civilization,

36
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:19,473
the Egyptian, Babylonian civilization.

37
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:47,238
If you think

38
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:50,441
that they opened up the
tombs of Tutankhamen

39
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:56,813
and honey that was 2000
years old is still edible...

40
00:08:57,517 --> 00:09:03,788
There is a reverence to bees.
There is also a reverence to the gods.

41
00:09:03,823 --> 00:09:11,865
Now, don't you think in some way that
we should actually be revering them

42
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,834
because they're actually keeping us alive,

43
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:17,120
as opposed to the other way around?

44
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:19,337
They're absolutely beautiful creatures.

45
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:22,830
They're God's creatures and
if we don't protect them

46
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:25,945
then we're not protecting ourselves.

47
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,175
Look. There they go.

48
00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:36,588
Honey was considered so
sacred as a gift from the bees.

49
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:45,258
The honey was not sold until the end
of the 19th or into the 20th century.

50
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:51,599
Most of the honey was
given away as a gift.

51
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:59,112
It is one of the most beneficial
and healing substances

52
00:09:59,147 --> 00:10:01,478
that we can imagine.

53
00:10:02,282 --> 00:10:07,552
It has enzymes, it has nutrients,
it has trace minerals

54
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:13,184
and it has forces of the
hexagonal, the silica forces in it.

55
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:19,198
And silica is a substance
in the earth's mantle.

56
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:22,326
About half of the earth's mantle is silica.

57
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:28,406
The silica in us is mainly
in the sense organs.

58
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:32,571
It is the sensing for what
goes on in the surrounding.

59
00:10:35,181 --> 00:10:37,148
So the silica and the honey

60
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:40,914
have a beneficial influence
on our evolution.

61
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:57,568
Mainly from the 19th century on

62
00:10:57,603 --> 00:11:03,276
we have gone into controlling
nature more and more.

63
00:11:03,311 --> 00:11:08,179
And we have lost that
feeling for sacredness.

64
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:18,191
Steiner gave lectures to the workers
at the Goetheanum in 1923

65
00:11:18,226 --> 00:11:19,657
and Steiner said, "'Yes,

66
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:23,161
this mechanization of beekeeping,

67
00:11:23,196 --> 00:11:28,201
this realm of life is becoming
mechanized and industrialized

68
00:11:28,236 --> 00:11:31,169
and that will eventually
destroy beekeeping

69
00:11:31,204 --> 00:11:35,508
and the honeybee might not
survive the end of the century.

70
00:11:35,543 --> 00:11:37,175
That is the 20th century.

71
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,011
So, now with the Colony
Collapse Disorder

72
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:46,252
it's clear that Steiner's
prediction has come true.

73
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:48,353
And as Steiner said that

74
00:11:48,388 --> 00:11:52,156
"'Our very lives depend on beekeeping.

75
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:56,195
Everybody should be
interested in beekeeping.

76
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,186
Our lives depend on it!"

77
00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:01,292
Look at the beautiful honey.

78
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:06,971
So I feel that we are seeing
changes in climate

79
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:14,213
but I think the Colony Collapse Disorder
and the disappearance of the honeybee

80
00:12:14,248 --> 00:12:19,310
is a much more pressing,
urgent problem to solve.

81
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:28,561
A lot of rationalization, a lot of
mechanizationhas gone into beekeeping

82
00:12:28,596 --> 00:12:31,295
to make it profitable.

83
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:36,736
And that has brought down
the honeybee in its vitality,

84
00:12:36,771 --> 00:12:38,704
in its health.

85
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:43,608
It's financial. It's financial!

86
00:12:43,643 --> 00:12:46,095
We're accepting things that
aren't ideal for the bees

87
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,456
because we have to for
the business that we're in

88
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:50,783
and we're in the business
to stay in business,

89
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:52,617
so we have to do it!

90
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:55,644
You're going to take ten! He's going to
take fourteen when you're done here!

91
00:12:58,691 --> 00:13:00,491
We are a mobile industry.

92
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:05,563
We run hundreds of thousands
of miles every year.

93
00:13:05,598 --> 00:13:09,694
Without the almond growers and the high
price we would never have survived.

94
00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:18,176
The almond crop is our fastest growing,

95
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:21,078
most profitable export
crop here in California.

96
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:24,582
Every February, just
around Valentines Day,

97
00:13:24,617 --> 00:13:29,213
has become the single greatest
pollination event in the world.

98
00:13:29,622 --> 00:13:34,227
Bees from the entire country,
as far away as New England

99
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:36,697
and Wisconsin and
Minnesota and Florida

100
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,049
get on trucks in the middle of the winter

101
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,332
and three quarters of all bees in America

102
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:45,771
come to California to perform
this absolutely critical act,

103
00:13:45,806 --> 00:13:48,539
where they have to be woken up,

104
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:51,542
strengthened with high
fructose corn syrup.

105
00:13:51,577 --> 00:13:54,278
I mean if there's anything
more viscerally offensive,

106
00:13:54,313 --> 00:14:00,218
it's the idea of feeding the creators
of honey high fructose corn syrup.

107
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:03,215
When we feed the corn syrup

108
00:14:04,624 --> 00:14:07,616
we hope that's there's enough natural

109
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:12,196
nectar and honey on the hive

110
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:16,861
to supplement whatever feed
they get out of the syrup.

111
00:14:45,631 --> 00:14:52,230
There is a 600,000-acre monoculture
of almonds in the central valley.

112
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:55,775
The problem is that every one of those
trees, every one of the blossoms

113
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,576
needs a bee to visit it.

114
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:02,580
Yet if there is nothing but
almonds in the central valley,

115
00:15:02,615 --> 00:15:05,318
there is nothing to eat for the
bees for the 50 weeks of the year

116
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:08,186
that the almonds aren't in bloom.

117
00:15:08,221 --> 00:15:10,223
So there essentially are no bees around.

118
00:15:10,258 --> 00:15:11,713
It's not sustainable.

119
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,728
Two or three years ago there were
not enough bees in America

120
00:15:15,763 --> 00:15:17,595
to pollinate the whole crop

121
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:22,918
so the USDA gave permission
to import bees from Australia.

122
00:15:22,953 --> 00:15:28,207
Now, as it happened, Australian
bees harbor certain viruses

123
00:15:28,242 --> 00:15:30,608
that are unfamiliar to American bees.

124
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:33,429
Israeli Acute Paralysis
Virus is one of those.

125
00:15:33,464 --> 00:15:36,074
We brought that in to
pollinate the almonds.

126
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:38,684
That's where all the
bees of America mixed.

127
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:40,953
We've created this great Bee Bordello

128
00:15:40,988 --> 00:15:42,587
as one beekeeper put it.

129
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:46,190
We constantly intermix
from all over the country,

130
00:15:46,225 --> 00:15:48,628
so if they've got something
in one part of the country

131
00:15:48,663 --> 00:15:50,328
like tracheal mite

132
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:52,365
and we don't have it in
our part of the country,

133
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,298
we certainly will have it

134
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:57,033
because the migratory
nature of beekeeping

135
00:15:57,068 --> 00:15:59,734
spreads all these pests
at a very rapid rate!

136
00:16:00,673 --> 00:16:02,707
We don't have a single event

137
00:16:02,742 --> 00:16:05,610
that causes the bees to go way down hill.

138
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:08,443
It's a little bit here and a little bit there.

139
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:13,252
These semi-load trips I believe
cause huge stress on them.

140
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:16,773
Once the hive starts getting
stressed to a certain point

141
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:20,530
then it can no longer cope with
many of these other things

142
00:16:20,565 --> 00:16:24,252
and that extra stress is just
enough to put it over the edge.

143
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,813
So many of the problems we
face come down to one thing

144
00:16:40,848 --> 00:16:42,474
and that is monoculture.

145
00:16:42,682 --> 00:16:45,484
There are many attractions
to monoculture, it's efficient,

146
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,271
but from the point of view
of nature it's... it's insane.

147
00:16:48,306 --> 00:16:51,023
And monocultures are the reason
that the bees are struggling.

148
00:16:51,058 --> 00:16:54,288
And monoculture is the
original sin of agriculture.

149
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:57,995
Now, the trouble with monoculture is it's

150
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:01,300
an absolute distortion of the
way an ecosystem works.

151
00:17:01,335 --> 00:17:03,267
Because what you do
with a monoculture is

152
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:05,770
you take your vibrant
eco-system, you destroy it...

153
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:09,642
then you put all... put in place
all the things you just took out.

154
00:17:09,677 --> 00:17:12,044
So instead of having natural
fertilizers in the soil

155
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,279
you add inorganic fertilizers,

156
00:17:15,314 --> 00:17:18,651
instead of allowing a natural ecosystem
around pests to develop

157
00:17:18,686 --> 00:17:20,618
you have to use pesticide.

158
00:17:20,653 --> 00:17:22,019
So what's the connection with bees?

159
00:17:22,054 --> 00:17:25,658
As far as the industrial agricultural
corporations are concerned,

160
00:17:25,693 --> 00:17:27,591
the solution that's being offered

161
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:31,295
is to destroy the insects
that make food possible

162
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,027
and this is the disaster that
they are ready to force on us.

163
00:17:36,068 --> 00:17:39,054
It used to be a continuous
paradise for honeybees

164
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:42,041
from Pennsylvania all the
way through South Dakota,

165
00:17:42,076 --> 00:17:44,375
the whole northern part of the country,

166
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,641
but now there's just huge... huge
expanses of it are just

167
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,462
monocrops of corn and soybeans.

168
00:17:50,497 --> 00:17:53,045
The fencerows are all gone.

169
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:55,619
The bees can't even live there

170
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:58,204
because there's not enough
for the bees to survive on

171
00:17:58,239 --> 00:18:00,755
in a continuous cornfield.
They'll starve to death.

172
00:18:02,695 --> 00:18:05,864
The German beekeepers and our bees

173
00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:09,268
live in a very serious situation.

174
00:18:09,303 --> 00:18:12,638
Every 2 years we have a disaster.

175
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:24,071
2006, 50%/% of the bee
colonies in America died.

176
00:18:26,786 --> 00:18:29,455
Perhaps in the next years in these areas

177
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,124
where the agriculture is so intensive

178
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:36,093
could bring us in a situation

179
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:41,434
that the bees do not find enough
pollen and nectar in the area

180
00:18:41,469 --> 00:18:43,800
for sustaining themselves.

181
00:18:58,884 --> 00:19:02,755
We are in such a habit of exploiting,

182
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:07,625
of using nature for our own ends

183
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,658
and the honeybees right
now, I think, are saying,

184
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:15,657
"'If you continue your
ways, I'm withdrawing."

185
00:19:28,481 --> 00:19:31,644
I've been a beekeeper for over 30 years.

186
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:36,985
I knew something had to be
done to help the honeybees.

187
00:19:37,923 --> 00:19:41,051
And here I was in my retirement.

188
00:19:43,696 --> 00:19:50,067
It was in this moment
of utter hopelessness

189
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:56,325
I had that feeling of urgency

190
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,944
to start this biodynamic farm

191
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:02,675
with a bee sanctuary at its heart.

192
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:08,085
Land had to be found,

193
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,757
people had to be found
to come and help me

194
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:15,158
and it was not easy.

195
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:21,098
You go on a great leap of faith and trust.

196
00:20:23,202 --> 00:20:26,388
I came to a moment
where I really doubted

197
00:20:26,423 --> 00:20:29,540
that I could do this alone with my wife

198
00:20:29,575 --> 00:20:35,104
and then at one point things
more or less fell apart.

199
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:43,054
And it seemed like everything
I had worked for was gone.

200
00:20:45,591 --> 00:20:49,795
Then the bees sort of let me know,

201
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,662
"'Go ahead. We'll help you,"'

202
00:20:56,669 --> 00:21:01,737
and a month later a wonderful
donor came for this purpose

203
00:21:01,772 --> 00:21:06,805
of creating a honeybee sanctuary
on a biodynamic farm.

204
00:21:09,949 --> 00:21:12,116
It's 610 acres

205
00:21:12,151 --> 00:21:16,679
that were maltreated
like the rest of our land.

206
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:23,660
We are surrounded here in
the heartland by Monsanto.

207
00:21:24,663 --> 00:21:29,668
Farms that are a lot of them
already corporate owned

208
00:21:29,703 --> 00:21:33,695
and with genetically manipulated seed.

209
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:40,668
These are, for the insect life, deserts

210
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,673
and there is no forage for the bees.

211
00:21:46,085 --> 00:21:47,780
They can't exist there.

212
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:52,056
So right now we are in this deep crisis

213
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:57,654
where we have to look at the honeybee
as a patient in the emergency room

214
00:21:58,097 --> 00:22:01,066
and you don't demand of a patient in
the emergency room that they perform

215
00:22:01,101 --> 00:22:05,059
and give you a lot of something.

216
00:22:05,804 --> 00:22:08,674
We are building up here
on Spikenard Farm

217
00:22:08,709 --> 00:22:11,677
a biodynamic farm for the bees.

218
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,777
We are enlivening the soil

219
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:17,805
and we are enlivening
all that is growing here

220
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:26,681
and it rays out into the surrounding area.

221
00:22:35,668 --> 00:22:37,635
From early humans on

222
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:46,712
we were quite touched and impressed
by the way bees can make honeycomb.

223
00:22:46,747 --> 00:22:50,705
And by how exact each cell is shaped.

224
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,775
They are all hexagonal.

225
00:22:54,153 --> 00:22:59,625
The honeycomb is actually
part of their metabolic system.

226
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:05,097
They sweat out the wax
between their abdominal rings.

227
00:23:05,132 --> 00:23:10,102
Honeycomb like this would
take approximately

228
00:23:10,137 --> 00:23:12,866
one million of those tiny platelets.

229
00:23:39,098 --> 00:23:43,694
The comb is the biggest
inner organ of the beehive.

230
00:23:44,103 --> 00:23:45,669
It's their skeleton;

231
00:23:45,704 --> 00:23:47,695
it's the place they live on.

232
00:23:48,941 --> 00:23:54,106
It is the womb for all of the baby bees.

233
00:23:55,114 --> 00:23:59,683
It's the place where nectar
is processed into honey.

234
00:23:59,718 --> 00:24:04,712
90%/% of their lifespan is happening
on the comb in darkness.

235
00:24:56,775 --> 00:24:58,142
In the beehive

236
00:24:58,177 --> 00:25:03,080
all the individual members dedicate
their lives for the bigger entity

237
00:25:03,115 --> 00:25:11,123
and sometimes I believe that monasteries
are actually imitating a beehive.

238
00:25:11,158 --> 00:25:16,192
There is this formalized
striving for selflessness,

239
00:25:16,227 --> 00:25:21,226
for letting go of ego, for the totality of life.

240
00:25:23,268 --> 00:25:25,498
The workers are all females.

241
00:25:25,904 --> 00:25:32,104
As a colony these 30, 40, 50
thousand female workers

242
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:35,714
all give up their sexuality,

243
00:25:35,749 --> 00:25:39,082
they do not produce offspring,

244
00:25:39,117 --> 00:25:43,487
and this renunciation of their sexuality,

245
00:25:43,522 --> 00:25:48,827
where they can then take care
of their queen in a wonderful way,

246
00:25:48,862 --> 00:25:53,699
they clean her and they feed
her and they feed each other

247
00:25:53,734 --> 00:25:58,537
and they do that service of
work for the entire colony.

248
00:25:58,572 --> 00:26:01,840
And all of it is for the future, for the health

249
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:04,104
and the wealth of the colony.

250
00:26:08,113 --> 00:26:13,118
We are entering the innards of this
being right now, at this moment.

251
00:26:13,153 --> 00:26:15,085
This is one whole being.

252
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,487
The biological term is super organism,

253
00:26:17,522 --> 00:26:20,150
something which goes beyond
a single individual organism.

254
00:26:23,528 --> 00:26:30,866
So those 20, 40, the 60 thousand
bees are one undividable entity.

255
00:27:45,143 --> 00:27:48,146
The relationship of bees and flowers
is one of the most beautiful

256
00:27:48,181 --> 00:27:51,138
co-evolutionary relationships we have.

257
00:27:53,151 --> 00:27:55,142
Bees are the legs of plants.

258
00:27:58,156 --> 00:28:00,158
The great existential fact of plant life

259
00:28:00,193 --> 00:28:01,694
is the inability to move.

260
00:28:01,729 --> 00:28:03,160
Being rooted in place.

261
00:28:03,195 --> 00:28:06,565
And the flowers have studied
the preferences of the bees

262
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,132
and learned precisely what patterns,

263
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:13,570
what smells, what shapes
are most attractive.

264
00:28:15,173 --> 00:28:18,210
So how do you deal with the
need to move your genes

265
00:28:18,245 --> 00:28:20,143
and expand your range?

266
00:28:20,178 --> 00:28:24,182
Well, the genius of flowers was
to recruit bees to do that for them

267
00:28:24,217 --> 00:28:26,646
and bees were their willing collaborators

268
00:28:26,681 --> 00:28:29,076
in their desire to move
their genes around.

269
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,490
One of the great mysteries
of the world I think is

270
00:28:33,525 --> 00:28:38,130
the fact that our taste and bees
coincide to the extent that they do.

271
00:28:38,165 --> 00:28:40,097
These are very different species

272
00:28:40,132 --> 00:28:42,034
but what a bee thinks smells
good, we think smells good

273
00:28:42,069 --> 00:28:44,201
and that's not always true.

274
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:47,005
There are a lot of plants
that are pollinated by flies

275
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,141
and those plants smell nasty.

276
00:28:49,176 --> 00:28:51,242
Smell like decomposing meat.

277
00:28:53,145 --> 00:28:56,512
Our canons of taste and the
bees are very, very close.

278
00:28:57,149 --> 00:29:00,550
Beauty to a bee is usually
beauty to a human as well.

279
00:31:52,591 --> 00:31:56,560
Industrial farming is based on chemicals.

280
00:31:56,595 --> 00:31:59,189
It's based on chemicals
that came from warfare.

281
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:02,666
They were designed to kill human beings

282
00:32:02,701 --> 00:32:05,602
but of course they instantly
kill the pollinators.

283
00:32:06,738 --> 00:32:10,173
The tremendous death of
bees that we are seeing

284
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:14,201
is the pesticides that have
been used very intensely.

285
00:32:15,313 --> 00:32:19,217
It's a much bigger problem
than just agriculture.

286
00:32:19,252 --> 00:32:22,919
The lawns that are sprayed
is so damaging

287
00:32:22,954 --> 00:32:28,950
to so many creatures that
are part of the food chain.

288
00:33:26,685 --> 00:33:31,588
I was with my bees and I
hear a noise of an airplane

289
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:36,926
and all of a sudden I see that
it is spraying something.

290
00:33:36,961 --> 00:33:42,967
So when I realize that insecticides
or fungicides were being sprayed

291
00:33:43,002 --> 00:33:45,954
- if the drift comes over here

292
00:33:45,989 --> 00:33:48,872
my bees are damaged or gone.

293
00:33:48,907 --> 00:33:52,942
When you see an airplane
like that coming and spraying

294
00:33:52,977 --> 00:33:59,017
there is this tremendous feeling
of not being able to do anything.

295
00:33:59,052 --> 00:34:01,551
You're just so vulnerable

296
00:34:01,586 --> 00:34:05,579
and all the bees that are
hit by it are so vulnerable.

297
00:34:07,525 --> 00:34:12,330
These are bees that are a treasure
for me and they are a part of me

298
00:34:12,365 --> 00:34:14,666
and I don't want to lose them.

299
00:34:14,701 --> 00:34:16,967
I really don't want to lose them.

300
00:34:19,971 --> 00:34:22,974
There are many people,
including a lot of beekeepers,

301
00:34:23,009 --> 00:34:25,994
who suspect a relatively
new class of pesticides

302
00:34:26,029 --> 00:34:28,889
might have a role in
Colony Collapse Disorder.

303
00:34:28,924 --> 00:34:31,715
Collectively they are called
the neonicotinoids

304
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:36,671
and it's true that they are among the
best selling insecticides worldwide.

305
00:34:36,706 --> 00:34:41,593
These neonicotinoids, which are neuro-
toxic, they target the nervous system,

306
00:34:41,628 --> 00:34:43,345
affect the ability of bees to learn

307
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,539
and to remember and to navigate,

308
00:34:45,574 --> 00:34:47,664
all of which would contribute

309
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:50,600
to an inability to return
to the hive after foraging.

310
00:34:51,002 --> 00:34:52,569
Bees are gleaners.

311
00:34:52,604 --> 00:34:54,604
Bees are particularly vulnerable

312
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,710
because they're really designed
to pick up small particles.

313
00:34:58,745 --> 00:35:02,578
They're built to electro-statically
attract pollen.

314
00:35:04,115 --> 00:35:09,348
We recently discovered with the seque-
ncing of the entire honeybee genome,

315
00:35:09,383 --> 00:35:14,582
honeybees are distinctly lacking enzymes
that break down poisons or toxins.

316
00:35:38,082 --> 00:35:44,956
In Europe bees are completely
dependent on human care and on

317
00:35:44,991 --> 00:35:47,424
human help.

318
00:35:47,659 --> 00:35:49,592
Without this care

319
00:35:49,627 --> 00:35:52,996
many, many bee colonies will die

320
00:35:53,031 --> 00:35:58,636
and only very few will survive
without the help of the beekeepers

321
00:35:58,671 --> 00:36:00,968
and all human beings.

322
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,508
In former times the coal miners

323
00:36:05,543 --> 00:36:08,976
had special birds in the coalmines

324
00:36:09,747 --> 00:36:14,081
and when the canary
birds stopped singing

325
00:36:14,586 --> 00:36:17,954
and stayed silent

326
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:23,188
it was time for the coal
miners to leave the mountain.

327
00:36:33,104 --> 00:36:36,474
What most people think of
when they think of a pollinator

328
00:36:36,509 --> 00:36:38,441
is they think of the honeybee and the

329
00:36:38,476 --> 00:36:42,013
honey bee is by far the most important
agricultural pollinator we have.

330
00:36:42,048 --> 00:36:45,048
But what a lot of people don't realize is

331
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:48,686
that we have about 4,000
species of other bees.

332
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:50,677
Everything from large bumblebees,

333
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:57,094
thousands of species of bees that
are everything from little bees,

334
00:36:57,129 --> 00:37:02,600
they look like flies, to bright green
- florescent almost green -

335
00:37:02,635 --> 00:37:05,735
to striped in different colors.

336
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:09,572
Bees of all varieties across the world.

337
00:37:09,607 --> 00:37:17,013
Beyond bees, flies and beetles
are very, very important pollinators.

338
00:37:17,615 --> 00:37:19,582
The beauty of the seed

339
00:37:19,617 --> 00:37:22,169
is out of one you can get millions.

340
00:37:22,204 --> 00:37:24,597
The beauty of the pollinator is

341
00:37:24,632 --> 00:37:27,313
it turns that one into the million

342
00:37:27,348 --> 00:37:29,959
and that's an economics of sharing.

343
00:37:29,994 --> 00:37:32,597
That's to me the real
economics of growth

344
00:37:32,632 --> 00:37:34,588
because life is growing.

345
00:37:36,768 --> 00:37:39,003
Without the pollinators
we'd lose the plants.

346
00:37:39,038 --> 00:37:40,703
They're just completely codependent.

347
00:37:40,738 --> 00:37:42,639
The pollinators wouldn't
be there without the plants

348
00:37:42,674 --> 00:37:45,006
and the plants wouldn't be
there without the pollinators.

349
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:48,738
We've seen a decline
in many of our bees.

350
00:37:49,147 --> 00:37:53,151
With our native bees
we are seeing declines

351
00:37:53,186 --> 00:37:55,585
probably from the same things:

352
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,756
Disease to nutrition to
potentially pesticides

353
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:01,993
as well as habitat loss.

354
00:38:23,014 --> 00:38:24,881
And the situation is pretty dire

355
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:28,886
and I think we're just beginning
to realize how dire it is.

356
00:38:28,921 --> 00:38:31,255
But at the same time nature comes up

357
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,056
with all sorts of surprises

358
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:35,293
and hopefully there will be
some cheering surprises

359
00:38:35,328 --> 00:38:37,284
rather than all gloomy ones.

360
00:38:37,862 --> 00:38:40,731
These little guys run the world.

361
00:38:40,766 --> 00:38:43,566
These guys really are the bosses.

362
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:48,038
They're doing all of our work for us and
without them we'd be in big trouble.

363
00:40:11,889 --> 00:40:14,992
You take genes from
an unrelated species

364
00:40:15,027 --> 00:40:18,061
and shoot it into the cells of a plant.

365
00:40:18,096 --> 00:40:21,566
And the only two ways you can
introduce unrelated genes

366
00:40:21,601 --> 00:40:25,001
- the first is the use of a
gene gun where you shoot

367
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:31,042
gold particles laden with genes
and put them into the organism.

368
00:40:31,077 --> 00:40:33,009
But it's a very unreliable process

369
00:40:33,044 --> 00:40:35,780
so you also have to add
antibiotic resistance markers.

370
00:40:35,815 --> 00:40:38,381
You also have to add viral promoters

371
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:42,019
and every genetically
engineered seed is a bundle

372
00:40:42,054 --> 00:40:46,012
of bacteria, toxins, viral promoters.

373
00:40:47,024 --> 00:40:48,725
Genetically modified organisms

374
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,787
are planted in millions of acres
around the United States.

375
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,732
Genetically engineered crops

376
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:59,430
can compromise the
immune system of bees.

377
00:41:00,037 --> 00:41:01,738
One German scientist found

378
00:41:01,773 --> 00:41:04,742
that when bees collect pollen from corn,

379
00:41:05,176 --> 00:41:07,410
the genes that have been
inserted into the corn end up

380
00:41:07,445 --> 00:41:12,733
transferring into the gut microorganisms
of the bees and continue to function.

381
00:41:12,768 --> 00:41:18,022
Unfortunately, human beings also get
genes transferred to their gut bacteria,

382
00:41:18,057 --> 00:41:21,822
meaning it produces this genetically
engineered bacteria inside of us.

383
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,960
When we start to manipulate
genetic material

384
00:41:26,995 --> 00:41:31,160
we are going to the
very deepest sources,

385
00:41:32,036 --> 00:41:35,028
to the very deepest layers
of the human being.

386
00:41:37,441 --> 00:41:40,433
It allows us to be almost god like.

387
00:41:41,512 --> 00:41:43,246
But the question is:

388
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:50,021
Do we have the wisdom, the morality,
the depth to do these interventions?

389
00:41:50,056 --> 00:41:52,421
Are we really knowing
what we are doing?

390
00:41:53,424 --> 00:41:56,058
Are we sure that what we do

391
00:41:56,093 --> 00:41:58,425
will not have long-term effects?

392
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:04,024
And we are not experimenting
here with animals or plants.

393
00:42:04,202 --> 00:42:06,534
We are experimenting
with the human being,

394
00:42:09,407 --> 00:42:13,036
with the soul of human beings,
with the body of human beings.

395
00:42:13,878 --> 00:42:21,085
Nature is very patient for a long
time but there is a moment

396
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:25,188
when things do collapse
and we have to wake up

397
00:42:25,223 --> 00:42:29,023
but hopefully wake up early
enough to make a change.

398
00:42:35,032 --> 00:42:40,972
I became a beekeeper in 2003 under
rather unusual circumstances.

399
00:42:41,007 --> 00:42:44,041
I had been invited by the
local beekeeping association

400
00:42:44,076 --> 00:42:46,444
to give them a talk on genetic engineering

401
00:42:46,479 --> 00:42:48,071
in relation to bees.

402
00:42:49,046 --> 00:42:51,080
And one of them said,

403
00:42:51,115 --> 00:42:53,416
"Why don't you come
and look at our bees?"'

404
00:42:53,451 --> 00:42:57,388
And then we opened some
beehives and that's what did it.

405
00:42:57,423 --> 00:42:59,288
I was absolutely smitten.

406
00:43:01,058 --> 00:43:04,462
One of the biggest challenges
to beekeepers was the varroa mite,

407
00:43:04,497 --> 00:43:08,030
which is now spread all
over the United Kingdom.

408
00:43:08,065 --> 00:43:12,470
It's a little beast that lives on
the bee and drinks it's blood

409
00:43:12,505 --> 00:43:14,537
and beekeepers have found,

410
00:43:14,572 --> 00:43:20,010
that unless they treat their bees
with chemicals every year,

411
00:43:20,278 --> 00:43:23,475
they will be killed by the varroa mite.

412
00:43:24,081 --> 00:43:26,617
I was taught the conventional
way of beekeeping

413
00:43:26,652 --> 00:43:29,370
and did all the things that
my mentors taught me

414
00:43:29,405 --> 00:43:32,054
which includes putting
chemicals in the hive.

415
00:43:32,089 --> 00:43:37,094
The chemical I started with
was a synthetic pyrethroid

416
00:43:37,129 --> 00:43:38,994
called Apistan.

417
00:43:40,498 --> 00:43:43,433
Clearly one doesn't want that
sort of thing in the honey.

418
00:43:44,936 --> 00:43:49,040
I was going down a road which
didn't really fit with my outlook.

419
00:43:49,075 --> 00:43:51,307
In fact, if you get the dosage wrong

420
00:43:51,342 --> 00:43:55,946
you get bee mortality from the
anti-varroa chemicals that you use.

421
00:43:55,981 --> 00:44:00,551
You are on a kind of treadmill
of putting chemicals in the hives.

422
00:44:00,586 --> 00:44:07,124
You are postponing the day
when the bee adapts to the mite.

423
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:10,061
In the process of trying to
kill the mites for so long

424
00:44:10,096 --> 00:44:11,494
and using so many chemicals

425
00:44:11,529 --> 00:44:16,467
we're breeding mites that
adapt faster and faster

426
00:44:16,502 --> 00:44:18,469
to every new chemical we throw at them.

427
00:44:18,504 --> 00:44:20,403
This deadly chemical Coumaphos

428
00:44:20,438 --> 00:44:23,758
has no effect whatsoever
on the varroa mite.

429
00:44:23,793 --> 00:44:27,078
In fact, the varroa mites
treated with Coumaphos

430
00:44:27,113 --> 00:44:28,945
did better by some measures

431
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,013
than mites that were not treated.

432
00:44:31,048 --> 00:44:37,154
So in other words, a chemical that
was formerly a deadly poison to them

433
00:44:37,189 --> 00:44:40,453
is now somehow being
used as a resource.

434
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:44,161
They're becoming stronger and stronger.

435
00:44:44,196 --> 00:44:47,153
We've bred a race of super mites.

436
00:44:50,067 --> 00:44:54,171
I'm keeping the Warré hive to
see if the bees can survive

437
00:44:54,206 --> 00:44:58,039
with varroa without any
intervention with chemicals.

438
00:44:59,076 --> 00:45:02,696
This method of keeping bees
without any chemicals

439
00:45:02,731 --> 00:45:06,317
runs the risk of going
for broke, definitely.

440
00:45:06,352 --> 00:45:08,551
You could lose all your colonies.

441
00:45:08,586 --> 00:45:14,458
But if you are interfering, you are
going against natural selection.

442
00:45:14,493 --> 00:45:17,026
Okay, this is a Darwinian approach.

443
00:45:17,061 --> 00:45:23,100
But the only other alternative is to stay
on the treadmill of giving chemicals

444
00:45:23,135 --> 00:45:26,399
year in, year out, forever.

445
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:29,505
And in this new type of hive

446
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:34,412
the bee might be in a better
home to defend itself

447
00:45:34,447 --> 00:45:37,380
against the ravages of the varroa mite.

448
00:45:37,415 --> 00:45:42,420
I'm leaving the bee and the mite,
more or less, to fight it out together.

449
00:45:42,455 --> 00:45:47,425
And that is, I think, the goal in
long-term sustainable beekeeping

450
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:52,419
is to let bee and mite co-evolve together.

451
00:46:15,052 --> 00:46:17,782
Phil?

452
00:46:19,056 --> 00:46:21,557
Phillip. Can you get me a jar?

453
00:46:21,592 --> 00:46:24,652
There's some beautiful
honeycomb up here.

454
00:46:26,397 --> 00:46:27,796
Thanks Phil.

455
00:46:28,399 --> 00:46:30,730
I'm going to put some
honeycomb in this. Yeah?

456
00:46:30,765 --> 00:46:33,062
Well put it in the bucket
and send it down later.

457
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,887
I was nine when I started beekeeping

458
00:46:35,922 --> 00:46:38,304
and I learned it from my stepfather Ian.

459
00:46:41,412 --> 00:46:43,379
When Phillip first started

460
00:46:43,414 --> 00:46:46,048
he actually pestered me
into keeping the bees.

461
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:51,419
He, at that point in time, was the
youngest beekeeper in the UK.

462
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:55,375
Bees have a sort of weird intelligence

463
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:57,561
and they can do things that humans can't

464
00:46:57,596 --> 00:46:59,061
like walk upside down.

465
00:46:59,096 --> 00:47:00,763
It's kind of the allure of Spiderman

466
00:47:00,798 --> 00:47:04,393
but sort of like the bad bit of Scorpion.

467
00:47:05,503 --> 00:47:08,806
You can, however, feel a little
bit of emotion for the queens

468
00:47:08,841 --> 00:47:12,537
who I have named after the
various queens of England.

469
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:18,111
Some of the names of the
queens are: Queen Elizabeth the First,

470
00:47:18,782 --> 00:47:21,717
Mary, who was named after Bloody Mary

471
00:47:21,752 --> 00:47:23,552
because she's one of
the most vicious hives.

472
00:47:23,587 --> 00:47:26,423
There's Queen Victoria who
spawns almost all the time

473
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:28,414
but is fairly stable.

474
00:47:34,832 --> 00:47:37,130
This is what is stress free.

475
00:47:38,402 --> 00:47:40,393
Day at work...

476
00:47:43,807 --> 00:47:50,406
sit down up here, look at my girls.

477
00:47:51,482 --> 00:47:53,417
You see the little antennae?

478
00:47:53,452 --> 00:47:55,408
It's lovely.

479
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,220
She's such a good girl.

480
00:48:00,424 --> 00:48:06,556
Come on. Back you go!

481
00:48:07,565 --> 00:48:10,295
Oh! Look at this!

482
00:48:11,168 --> 00:48:13,986
And this is Hackney in London.

483
00:48:14,021 --> 00:48:16,805
This is what people can do.

484
00:48:17,608 --> 00:48:21,442
People say that they can't
keep bees. They're lying.

485
00:48:22,179 --> 00:48:28,414
And look at that side,
dripping with honey.

486
00:48:29,453 --> 00:48:34,790
All these girlies... yeah,
these girlies here?

487
00:48:34,825 --> 00:48:39,421
...are putting everything
back into the environment.

488
00:48:40,431 --> 00:48:43,798
Not me. I'm just helping them

489
00:48:44,802 --> 00:48:48,431
and I just think it is so rewarding.

490
00:48:54,812 --> 00:48:59,806
The sun lets life be created on earth.

491
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,823
Without the warmth, without the light,

492
00:49:05,858 --> 00:49:08,690
no life would be here.

493
00:49:09,426 --> 00:49:13,796
The bees themselves are sun creatures

494
00:49:13,831 --> 00:49:17,892
and the bees being such
great sun beings,

495
00:49:18,969 --> 00:49:22,427
they are the nurturers of life on earth.

496
00:49:24,575 --> 00:49:29,240
The queen, the most sublime
being in such a hive,

497
00:49:29,275 --> 00:49:33,906
is deeply, deeply connected
with the sun forces.

498
00:49:45,562 --> 00:49:49,464
When the young queen emerges,

499
00:49:51,468 --> 00:49:53,836
when she goes on her marriage flight,

500
00:49:53,871 --> 00:49:57,864
she flies up around 600 feet into the air.

501
00:49:58,475 --> 00:50:01,467
She flies through this swarm of drones

502
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:08,512
and is mated by up to a dozen drones

503
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:16,293
so that when she returns, she
has over a million sperm in her

504
00:50:16,328 --> 00:50:20,889
and she can lay millions
of eggs over her lifespan.

505
00:50:21,832 --> 00:50:27,337
And she can lay approximately
1500 to 2000 eggs a day

506
00:50:27,372 --> 00:50:32,843
which is more weight-wise
than her own body weight.

507
00:50:32,878 --> 00:50:36,412
A tremendous feat if you consider that,

508
00:50:36,447 --> 00:50:41,441
that she can lay more than her
own weight in eggs on one day.

509
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:49,855
I am a queen breeder.
I breed queen bees.

510
00:50:50,761 --> 00:50:53,831
I'm doing this so that I can
be a commercial beekeeper,

511
00:50:53,866 --> 00:50:55,958
so I can make a living from bees.

512
00:50:56,834 --> 00:51:00,827
Each one of those will have a
queen bee hatch out from it.

513
00:51:01,538 --> 00:51:06,760
The problem with bee breeding
has always been this compromise

514
00:51:06,795 --> 00:51:11,982
between inbreeding which is
the way of fixing certain traits

515
00:51:12,017 --> 00:51:18,520
so that an entire line of
queens will all be similar.

516
00:51:18,555 --> 00:51:22,860
But if you push that process too
far it ultimately weakens the bee

517
00:51:22,895 --> 00:51:25,427
and you've lost the vigor

518
00:51:25,462 --> 00:51:27,896
and once you've lost vigor,
you've lost everything.

519
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:34,433
Modern queen breeding has brought
the quality of the queen down

520
00:51:34,468 --> 00:51:38,966
to a level where the queens
nowadays don't live 4 to 5 years.

521
00:51:39,843 --> 00:51:42,903
They sometimes don't
live even one year.

522
00:51:43,847 --> 00:51:48,151
So they are susceptible
to all kind of illnesses

523
00:51:48,186 --> 00:51:52,456
so now we have to requeen
practically every year

524
00:51:52,491 --> 00:51:54,447
because the queens don't last long.

525
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:58,427
It's the same with the cow.

526
00:51:58,462 --> 00:52:01,948
The cow, instead of living 20 years,

527
00:52:01,983 --> 00:52:05,434
has a life expectancy of 3 to 4 years.

528
00:52:06,403 --> 00:52:08,837
Not even one guaranteed calf.

529
00:52:11,442 --> 00:52:14,843
There are parallels with bee
breeding and animal breeding.

530
00:52:15,879 --> 00:52:20,839
Chickens' and pigs' genetic stocks
have been just weakened terribly.

531
00:52:22,886 --> 00:52:27,458
They have to be propped up, almost
literally propped up, even to stand up

532
00:52:27,493 --> 00:52:28,991
so they can eat.

533
00:52:29,026 --> 00:52:31,460
That's the direction we're going in.

534
00:52:33,464 --> 00:52:35,966
The biology of honeybees is set up

535
00:52:36,001 --> 00:52:38,434
to avoid inbreeding at all costs

536
00:52:38,469 --> 00:52:42,940
and if bees are inbred for very
long they start to become weaker.

537
00:52:42,975 --> 00:52:46,411
The artificial insemination of queens

538
00:52:46,446 --> 00:52:49,847
is where a young queen, a virgin queen,

539
00:52:49,882 --> 00:52:52,839
is knocked out.

540
00:52:53,851 --> 00:52:56,979
Sperm is squeezed out of some drones

541
00:52:58,455 --> 00:53:01,447
and the queen is artificially inseminated.

542
00:53:01,959 --> 00:53:05,027
The problem I see there is

543
00:53:05,062 --> 00:53:08,565
that in nature the young queen
goes on a marriage flight

544
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,868
and that's actually the health of it.

545
00:53:10,903 --> 00:53:12,935
That the queen will breed

546
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:16,839
with up to a dozen drones
of different varieties

547
00:53:16,874 --> 00:53:21,879
and here we are creating another,
like a monoculture, one stock

548
00:53:21,914 --> 00:53:27,251
and that stock is good
for a little while and then

549
00:53:27,286 --> 00:53:31,906
it doesn't have the life
forces that is necessary.

550
00:53:31,941 --> 00:53:36,527
In the beehive we can
actually see what happens

551
00:53:36,562 --> 00:53:39,496
if we start to manipulate nature.

552
00:53:39,897 --> 00:53:41,864
For awhile nothing much.

553
00:53:41,899 --> 00:53:44,501
For ten, twenty years it
is possible to do that.

554
00:53:44,536 --> 00:53:46,935
But after 50, 60, 100 years

555
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:51,775
you can see the effects of such
manipulation very, very clearly.

556
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:56,580
It's very interesting that in one of Rudolf Steiner's lectures

557
00:53:56,615 --> 00:53:58,213
he recognized very early on,

558
00:53:58,248 --> 00:54:01,852
if we manipulate the bee
civilization on that level

559
00:54:01,887 --> 00:54:05,253
there will be a long-term effect.

560
00:54:05,722 --> 00:54:09,123
And we are reaping the
harvest we have sown.

561
00:54:14,865 --> 00:54:18,268
This image of a queen in a cage
became a prominent image for me

562
00:54:18,303 --> 00:54:20,235
in the play

563
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:24,604
and the queen represents
for me the soul of the world.

564
00:54:26,877 --> 00:54:30,881
I was looking into this metaphor
of the queen in the cage

565
00:54:30,916 --> 00:54:33,975
and how bees were being
handled in the world today.

566
00:54:34,851 --> 00:54:36,546
There's a queen bee just there.

567
00:54:38,956 --> 00:54:41,254
So, we put her in a cage.

568
00:54:42,259 --> 00:54:43,954
I'll cage up all this one

569
00:54:45,195 --> 00:54:47,959
then I can send her away
and sell her to somebody.

570
00:54:48,832 --> 00:54:54,271
All the queen bees in cages are
being exported to the United States

571
00:54:54,306 --> 00:54:56,865
to build up the colonies in the States.

572
00:54:57,274 --> 00:55:02,268
This has degenerated the whole
strength of the bee colony.

573
00:55:07,618 --> 00:55:11,253
We have to raise queens
again the natural way

574
00:55:11,288 --> 00:55:18,057
and this we have to respect:
That nature is much wiser than we are.

575
00:55:30,207 --> 00:55:32,275
We live with our bees in
the bush, in the forest.

576
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:34,242
We've moved with them

577
00:55:34,277 --> 00:55:37,214
and you do become very
in tune with nature

578
00:55:37,249 --> 00:55:39,114
when you live with them all the time

579
00:55:39,149 --> 00:55:42,985
and they have got some
magical, magical properties

580
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:46,820
and magical things they do.
I think some of it rubs off on us.

581
00:55:48,225 --> 00:55:49,852
Did you hear that?

582
00:55:51,828 --> 00:55:53,295
Well, my father was a beekeeper

583
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:56,616
and his grandfather had a
bit of a fiddle before him,

584
00:55:56,651 --> 00:55:59,868
so I started getting stung
at a pretty early age.

585
00:55:59,903 --> 00:56:02,838
Belting on the lids of the hives
down in the back yard

586
00:56:02,873 --> 00:56:05,876
and my mum... remember my mum telling
me running up to the house screaming

587
00:56:05,911 --> 00:56:08,868
with a head full of angry bees
stinging all out at you.

588
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,579
You just snap a handful off like that.

589
00:56:12,614 --> 00:56:14,879
This gets the smoker going pretty quick.

590
00:56:16,286 --> 00:56:19,278
Just push it down in there a bit
until it gets a little bit going...

591
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:21,280
and a bit of a puff.

592
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:23,892
You can smell - smell the honey.

593
00:56:24,194 --> 00:56:25,889
It's a bit odd today.

594
00:56:27,064 --> 00:56:30,867
We don't have the trouble in Australia
yet with the Colony Collapse Disorder

595
00:56:30,902 --> 00:56:32,664
that they seem to be having in America.

596
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:37,374
So I think you're just creating such a
big toxic load that the bees have had

597
00:56:37,409 --> 00:56:40,935
enough so out the door they go and
go and look for greener pastures.

598
00:56:43,013 --> 00:56:48,919
In West Australia the use of
chemicals is banned for the treatment

599
00:56:48,954 --> 00:56:51,012
of hive diseases and parasites.

600
00:56:51,288 --> 00:56:54,224
As a consequence our
honey is quite pristine

601
00:56:54,259 --> 00:56:56,794
compared to other parts of the world

602
00:56:56,829 --> 00:56:59,294
who have to treat with miticides etc.

603
00:56:59,329 --> 00:57:03,288
Which must in turn leach into the honey
and give you a contaminated product.

604
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:06,903
This is a bit of fresh
West Australian nectar

605
00:57:06,938 --> 00:57:08,393
right off the wondoo.

606
00:57:08,905 --> 00:57:11,273
It's... mmm... beautiful,

607
00:57:11,308 --> 00:57:15,301
beautiful, sweet, light flavored honey.

608
00:57:15,979 --> 00:57:18,643
Excellent for toast and crumpets and

609
00:57:18,678 --> 00:57:21,307
yeah, could just eat that all day.

610
00:57:34,931 --> 00:57:36,455
Baaaaa!

611
00:57:39,836 --> 00:57:43,240
In New Zealand we have this
fantastic history of beekeeping

612
00:57:43,275 --> 00:57:47,776
because it's very much part
of farming community

613
00:57:47,811 --> 00:57:51,214
that involves beekeepers and
farmers working together

614
00:57:51,249 --> 00:57:54,342
to have a whole agricultural
system that works.

615
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:59,187
The feeling for nature and for the bees

616
00:57:59,222 --> 00:58:03,886
and that has become very much
connected to my Maori connection.

617
00:58:04,294 --> 00:58:08,797
In old societies the beekeeper
was a very respected person.

618
00:58:08,832 --> 00:58:13,236
He became someone that was revered
and someone that was looked up to

619
00:58:13,271 --> 00:58:15,830
who would bring in this sweetness.

620
00:58:16,306 --> 00:58:19,309
The Maori were very much a
people that would watch nature

621
00:58:19,344 --> 00:58:20,942
and watch insects

622
00:58:20,977 --> 00:58:25,015
and if they would see changes in them,
these changes would mean a lot to them

623
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:28,883
and they would mean that there would
be changes coming for them as well.

624
00:58:33,023 --> 00:58:35,287
We're hearing stories from America

625
00:58:36,026 --> 00:58:38,912
of bees not coming back to their colony

626
00:58:38,947 --> 00:58:41,763
and for me to think that my children

627
00:58:41,798 --> 00:58:45,852
won't have pollination happening
with their berries

628
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:49,906
and with their vegetable
patches and food supply,

629
00:58:49,941 --> 00:58:53,433
I find -

630
00:58:54,044 --> 00:58:57,914
I find that really something
that's really affecting my heart.

631
00:58:57,949 --> 00:59:01,118
And I'm really finding out
why I'm beekeeping is

632
00:59:01,153 --> 00:59:04,722
to keep that going
for my children's children.

633
00:59:04,757 --> 00:59:09,827
If bees leave this world I wouldn't like it

634
00:59:09,862 --> 00:59:14,863
because there would be
no honey and no fruit,

635
00:59:14,898 --> 00:59:18,891
because you wouldn't find many
peaches or apples these days then.

636
00:59:21,304 --> 00:59:25,308
My three daughters and my wife are
now coming out into the field with me

637
00:59:25,343 --> 00:59:28,944
and that's an incredibly warming feeling

638
00:59:28,979 --> 00:59:32,312
around the bees is to
have a family business.

639
00:59:34,851 --> 00:59:39,890
It's wonderful that the kids can be
part of the financial business making

640
00:59:39,925 --> 00:59:44,918
and roll candles for the girls to
be able to sell at the market.

641
00:59:45,295 --> 00:59:48,648
And all the wax we make
- and it helps us

642
00:59:48,683 --> 00:59:51,967
get some money to look after our ponies,

643
00:59:52,002 --> 00:59:55,188
which are very special to us,
and we really like doing that.

644
00:59:55,223 --> 00:59:58,375
So this is Lace. She's 30 years
old and she loves honey.

645
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:01,211
She's great! She goes out
and wins competitions

646
01:00:01,246 --> 01:00:03,075
and she's healthy.

647
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:04,904
She's a good pony.

648
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:14,324
Well, we had a pony that had an electric
fence that pulled all his skin down.

649
01:00:14,359 --> 01:00:17,127
So we had to pull it up like a sock,

650
01:00:17,162 --> 01:00:19,896
bandage it with Manuka
honey every day;

651
01:00:19,931 --> 01:00:21,263
fresh Manuka honey on everyday

652
01:00:21,298 --> 01:00:23,300
and the whole thing
has healed completely

653
01:00:23,335 --> 01:00:24,892
and vets can't believe it.

654
01:01:58,661 --> 01:02:00,997
What's particularly unfortunate is that

655
01:02:01,032 --> 01:02:03,298
honeybees are often blamed for stings

656
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:06,063
that are inflicted by other hymenopterans.

657
01:02:06,336 --> 01:02:08,670
To an entomologist a yellow-jacket

658
01:02:08,705 --> 01:02:11,003
is a wasp. It looks nothing like a bee.

659
01:02:11,038 --> 01:02:13,301
Bees are sort of brownish and fuzzy,

660
01:02:13,743 --> 01:02:16,312
yellow-jackets are yellow
and black and shiny.

661
01:02:16,347 --> 01:02:19,280
Different behavior, different gestalt.

662
01:02:19,315 --> 01:02:25,321
But the vast majority of non-entomologists,
people are either unwilling to

663
01:02:25,356 --> 01:02:28,313
or unable to differentiate.

664
01:02:28,725 --> 01:02:30,692
Ah! A Bee!

665
01:02:30,727 --> 01:02:34,731
So bees get a lot of bad
press that is undeserved.

666
01:02:34,766 --> 01:02:36,766
Can you clip this little
branch there first?

667
01:02:36,801 --> 01:02:38,564
This one right here? Yeah.

668
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:40,327
It's about to go. Okay.

669
01:02:41,438 --> 01:02:43,030
Oops.

670
01:02:46,342 --> 01:02:48,276
A swarm,

671
01:02:48,311 --> 01:02:52,014
as much as people don't like it,

672
01:02:52,049 --> 01:02:55,683
is a natural way of procreation;

673
01:02:55,718 --> 01:03:00,288
of guaranteeing that more
colonies of bees are there.

674
01:03:00,323 --> 01:03:04,692
And at the right time when the
new queens are ready to emerge

675
01:03:04,727 --> 01:03:11,326
the old queen with almost half of the
entire workers will leave the hive.

676
01:03:11,768 --> 01:03:16,756
They swirl around in the
circumference of maybe 50 feet

677
01:03:16,791 --> 01:03:21,709
and then the queen lands and
alights on maybe a branch

678
01:03:21,744 --> 01:03:27,282
and the of the rest of those
swarm bees gather in a cluster

679
01:03:27,317 --> 01:03:31,321
and they hang there until they
are either taken by the beekeeper

680
01:03:31,356 --> 01:03:34,313
or they find a new home.

681
01:03:37,327 --> 01:03:41,764
So the commercial or the
average hobby beekeeper

682
01:03:41,799 --> 01:03:44,699
prevents swarming

683
01:03:44,734 --> 01:03:47,737
and we have taken that joy,

684
01:03:47,772 --> 01:03:49,704
that joie de vivre,

685
01:03:49,739 --> 01:03:53,510
that wonderful invigorating activity

686
01:03:53,545 --> 01:03:55,740
away from them.

687
01:03:57,113 --> 01:03:59,714
For the honeybee to regain her health

688
01:03:59,749 --> 01:04:05,321
I think we also have to see that
the swarming is allowed again

689
01:04:05,356 --> 01:04:07,516
as much as possible.

690
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:18,700
When somebody calls,

691
01:04:18,735 --> 01:04:21,727
and I'm on lists all over
the place for swarms,

692
01:04:22,739 --> 01:04:26,835
I actually go to the hives where people
are freaked out and they're afraid.

693
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:28,710
That to me is like,

694
01:04:28,745 --> 01:04:30,542
"'Uh oh! Hive in danger."

695
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:33,314
A lot of people will call an exterminator.

696
01:04:33,349 --> 01:04:37,554
They really think that the bees are
going to attack or something like that.

697
01:04:37,589 --> 01:04:40,887
They are at their most docile at that time.

698
01:04:42,358 --> 01:04:45,428
Exterminators come and
they poison them!

699
01:04:45,463 --> 01:04:46,728
I tell people that,

700
01:04:46,763 --> 01:04:48,730
"'You are seeing a miracle of nature.

701
01:04:48,765 --> 01:04:52,368
This is a force of nature come
and landed on your tree."

702
01:04:52,403 --> 01:04:55,599
The beehive is just simply
moving to a new home.

703
01:04:58,374 --> 01:05:00,777
The woman I was helping
she had just taken my class.

704
01:05:00,812 --> 01:05:02,779
She didn't have any bees before.

705
01:05:02,814 --> 01:05:04,345
Often I say,

706
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:06,347
"'Get a swarm. Don't buy bees.

707
01:05:06,382 --> 01:05:09,585
That's commercial, that's
cattle ranching bees."

708
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:12,706
And I invite them to come
with me on a swarm call.

709
01:05:12,741 --> 01:05:15,757
And I help people get
set up with their first hive.

710
01:05:15,792 --> 01:05:19,729
It's so wonderful, then they get to handle
the bees and they get to be with them.

711
01:05:19,764 --> 01:05:22,777
It isn't just sticking them into
a box and letting them grow.

712
01:05:22,812 --> 01:05:25,791
So they get to interact with them
right from the very beginning.

713
01:05:27,604 --> 01:05:29,799
Isn't that beautiful?

714
01:05:30,873 --> 01:05:35,345
You could see how happy she was
and she started singing with the bees

715
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:37,413
and she was feeling into them and...

716
01:05:37,448 --> 01:05:39,472
she'll be a good bee momma.

717
01:05:39,916 --> 01:05:41,884
I can't express it!

718
01:05:44,454 --> 01:05:46,321
I'm like a little kid.

719
01:05:46,356 --> 01:05:48,823
It's like I got my first bicycle
or something, I don't know.

720
01:05:48,858 --> 01:05:52,726
I'm just so excited to work with
them and learn with them and... yeah.

721
01:06:07,443 --> 01:06:10,742
My name is Wisteria and I'm a backyard
beekeeper in Portland, Oregon

722
01:06:11,347 --> 01:06:19,454
and we are building beehives
and painting bee boxes.

723
01:06:19,489 --> 01:06:23,860
I've got my friends and family and
members of the bee project here.

724
01:06:23,895 --> 01:06:25,727
We're tasting mead...

725
01:06:25,762 --> 01:06:29,330
Which is delicious. It has a
little bit of sparkle to it.

726
01:06:29,365 --> 01:06:32,766
...and just sharing with families from
Portland what beekeeping is all about.

727
01:06:44,347 --> 01:06:46,816
I'm a rooftop beekeeper
in New York City.

728
01:06:46,851 --> 01:06:49,341
And I'm a third generation beekeeper.

729
01:06:49,986 --> 01:06:52,580
It's illegal here to keep bees.

730
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:00,591
It kind of scares me,
it worries me a little bit.

731
01:07:03,433 --> 01:07:05,765
I really would like to keep my bees.

732
01:07:07,503 --> 01:07:11,735
We're really just trying to do
something simple for nature.

733
01:07:16,012 --> 01:07:17,712
This is really a crazy moment here.

734
01:07:17,747 --> 01:07:20,715
As we're doing this
there is a swarm of bees!

735
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:24,354
They look like they're going
into that tree right there

736
01:07:24,389 --> 01:07:26,356
which, is not... is just completely bizarre.

737
01:07:26,391 --> 01:07:27,857
I'm not sure where they came from

738
01:07:27,892 --> 01:07:29,524
and they're coming closer.

739
01:07:29,559 --> 01:07:32,862
It does look like they are sort
of aiming right in there though.

740
01:07:32,897 --> 01:07:34,329
That's crazy.

741
01:07:34,364 --> 01:07:36,764
Yeah, I've never quite
seen this happening.

742
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:43,773
I think you guys brought
that mojo, honestly.

743
01:07:43,808 --> 01:07:45,440
Only in the Bronx, baby,

744
01:07:45,475 --> 01:07:47,375
are you going to find a swarm.

745
01:07:53,349 --> 01:07:57,787
Legalize beekeeping!
Give the bees a chance.

746
01:07:57,822 --> 01:08:01,723
Long live the honeybee! Wooo!

747
01:08:01,758 --> 01:08:08,364
All we are saying, is give bees a chance.

748
01:08:08,399 --> 01:08:11,879
Legalize beekeeping! Woo!

749
01:08:11,914 --> 01:08:15,360
Give the bees a chance!

750
01:08:16,606 --> 01:08:19,809
Beekeeping, the vital practice of man-
aging and maintaining honeybee colonies

751
01:08:19,844 --> 01:08:22,341
for pollination and honey production,

752
01:08:22,376 --> 01:08:24,838
is a banned practice in New York City.

753
01:08:25,448 --> 01:08:28,851
This ban is outdated and detrimental
to the health and wellbeing

754
01:08:28,886 --> 01:08:31,721
of our urban environment
and our community.

755
01:08:31,756 --> 01:08:33,788
This bill needs our support

756
01:08:33,823 --> 01:08:36,492
and I encourage you to call your
city council representative today

757
01:08:36,527 --> 01:08:39,395
and encourage them to support councilman Yassky's bill.

758
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:40,828
One of my neighbors,

759
01:08:40,863 --> 01:08:45,630
probably because they were
uninformed and scared maybe,

760
01:08:46,002 --> 01:08:50,004
reported the hive to
the health department

761
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:53,843
and as a result I was served
with a notice of violation

762
01:08:53,878 --> 01:08:57,612
and I have to appear at a
hearing in fifteen minutes.

763
01:08:57,647 --> 01:09:01,651
If she has a child and sees, as she
pointed out, this swarm of bees -

764
01:09:01,686 --> 01:09:05,721
If beekeeping is done
properly it's a safe activity.

765
01:09:05,756 --> 01:09:07,021
This solves both problems.

766
01:09:07,056 --> 01:09:09,624
Lets people who want to do it, do it,

767
01:09:09,659 --> 01:09:12,662
and make sure that those who are
going to engage in this beekeeping

768
01:09:12,697 --> 01:09:14,028
do it safely.

769
01:09:14,063 --> 01:09:16,048
So, here we have a
wonderful opportunity

770
01:09:16,083 --> 01:09:18,860
to do what other great cities have done:

771
01:09:18,895 --> 01:09:22,268
Legalize bees, allow
for honey production,

772
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:25,735
whether it's on a tiny
rooftop or small garden

773
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:29,168
and build the sustainability
movement bee by bee.

774
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,857
At our Honey Festival there'll be tastings

775
01:09:40,892 --> 01:09:43,157
and jugglers and demonstrations

776
01:09:43,192 --> 01:09:47,663
so you should definitely come
and pick up your local honey there.

777
01:09:47,698 --> 01:09:51,067
And all this week restaurants
across New York City are

778
01:09:51,102 --> 01:09:53,695
participating in New York Nectar.

779
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:07,672
So, I'm a beekeeper here
at the Center for Discovery.

780
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:12,985
I just had this sense that I
had this calling to do service.

781
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:16,684
And so, I'm at home, I'm in heaven here.

782
01:10:19,095 --> 01:10:21,697
One of the most amazing things
about the farm is that we're -

783
01:10:21,732 --> 01:10:24,700
we're working with
people with disabilities.

784
01:10:24,735 --> 01:10:26,467
But by working with them in a -

785
01:10:26,502 --> 01:10:28,803
and integrating them into
a farm based program

786
01:10:28,838 --> 01:10:31,104
they really become
individuals with abilities.

787
01:10:36,712 --> 01:10:37,940
Nice work!

788
01:10:39,782 --> 01:10:43,819
People with autism have
this innate affinity for nature

789
01:10:43,854 --> 01:10:47,152
and so by working
outside they're at home.

790
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:52,762
So when I think about
Colony Collapse Disorder

791
01:10:52,797 --> 01:10:55,665
I really hope that we can, as a society,

792
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:57,131
have a connection with nature

793
01:10:57,166 --> 01:10:59,191
instead of a disconnect with nature.

794
01:11:00,803 --> 01:11:03,739
And one of the things that I
really enjoy about the bees

795
01:11:03,774 --> 01:11:06,676
is that they all have this really
strong sense of mission.

796
01:11:06,711 --> 01:11:08,644
It's not about individual advantage.

797
01:11:08,679 --> 01:11:10,864
It's not about getting ahead.

798
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:13,014
They take on different tasks,

799
01:11:13,049 --> 01:11:15,651
like they might start
off as a housekeeper

800
01:11:15,686 --> 01:11:17,018
and then a nurse bee

801
01:11:17,053 --> 01:11:20,021
and much like we have
different roles here.

802
01:11:20,056 --> 01:11:24,755
We have integration specialists
and skills trainers,

803
01:11:25,761 --> 01:11:28,129
all sorts of people coming
together as a team

804
01:11:28,164 --> 01:11:32,191
to provide a really rich and
meaningful life for our residents here.

805
01:11:33,669 --> 01:11:35,636
Our job is to create a family for them

806
01:11:35,671 --> 01:11:39,040
and to build a community that
they can really thrive in and where

807
01:11:39,075 --> 01:11:43,671
they can find their own niche to really
be the individual that they really are.

808
01:11:52,655 --> 01:11:54,723
If you take a single bee out of a hive,

809
01:11:54,758 --> 01:11:56,757
it actually can't live on it's own.

810
01:11:56,792 --> 01:12:00,057
It's biologically dependent
upon community.

811
01:12:00,663 --> 01:12:03,661
And even though some humans
can survive on their own,

812
01:12:03,696 --> 01:12:06,660
the individuals that we
take care of here cannot.

813
01:12:09,672 --> 01:12:13,075
They really are dependent upon on
a team of people coming together

814
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:15,109
to be of service to them.

815
01:12:15,144 --> 01:12:17,044
And coming together in all humility,

816
01:12:17,079 --> 01:12:20,082
just like the bees do when they
take on their individual roles,

817
01:12:20,117 --> 01:12:22,676
in their particular stage of life.

818
01:12:35,097 --> 01:12:37,066
We have to care for
nature in the right way

819
01:12:37,101 --> 01:12:39,091
and nature will care for us in turn.

820
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:43,037
So community is not
just a human problem,

821
01:12:43,072 --> 01:12:47,677
it's a global problem, community
with one another and nature.

822
01:12:47,712 --> 01:12:51,080
So human community is
the perfect training ground

823
01:12:51,115 --> 01:12:54,072
for community with
the planet, with nature.

824
01:12:55,117 --> 01:12:57,652
We keep bees because we love them

825
01:12:57,687 --> 01:13:01,088
and we love them because
they need our help now.

826
01:13:01,691 --> 01:13:04,176
Someone has to take care of them

827
01:13:04,211 --> 01:13:06,699
and so the beekeeper's job is to see

828
01:13:06,734 --> 01:13:09,187
that the bees stay happy and healthy.

829
01:13:16,072 --> 01:13:19,871
We now have three colonies
of bees in that garden.

830
01:13:19,906 --> 01:13:23,671
The children are absolutely
relaxed in their presence.

831
01:13:26,082 --> 01:13:28,778
They are aware of the
problems of the honeybee.

832
01:13:30,753 --> 01:13:34,055
So, bees belong to be all over the world

833
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:38,828
and the great problem now is they are
not because we are creating places

834
01:13:38,863 --> 01:13:40,661
where they can't live.

835
01:13:40,696 --> 01:13:43,699
That's why we're doing what
we're doing here in the garden.

836
01:13:43,734 --> 01:13:46,769
We're trying to show you young people

837
01:13:46,804 --> 01:13:50,102
how to put bees everywhere.

838
01:13:52,808 --> 01:13:56,143
Colony Collapse, I've experienced it.

839
01:13:56,178 --> 01:13:59,115
I'm an organic beekeeper
with the best of intentions.

840
01:13:59,150 --> 01:14:02,107
I've gone to some hives
and they're gone.

841
01:14:03,719 --> 01:14:05,118
The problems are here.

842
01:14:05,721 --> 01:14:07,712
They're everybody's problems now

843
01:14:09,158 --> 01:14:12,127
and we all suffer the
consequences of that.

844
01:14:14,764 --> 01:14:18,234
Commercial beekeepers cannot
stop and reverse direction

845
01:14:18,269 --> 01:14:20,464
without risking bankruptcy.

846
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:22,703
And an alternative

847
01:14:22,738 --> 01:14:26,603
to rolling on the interstates
20,000 miles a year

848
01:14:26,638 --> 01:14:30,468
would be to go to the various
monoculture productions

849
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,847
and simply tell them,

850
01:14:32,882 --> 01:14:34,381
"'The writing is on the wall.

851
01:14:34,416 --> 01:14:37,748
One of these springs you're going
to call for migratory beekeepers

852
01:14:37,783 --> 01:14:41,081
and they won't be there for you
and you'll be out of business.

853
01:14:41,991 --> 01:14:45,411
Why don't you take a small
portion of your holdings

854
01:14:45,446 --> 01:14:48,831
and plow it under and plant
it with bee friendly crops

855
01:14:48,866 --> 01:14:51,681
to sustain those creatures all year long

856
01:14:51,716 --> 01:14:54,497
not just for three weeks in the spring.

857
01:14:56,839 --> 01:15:00,005
That way you will know
what your situation is

858
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:03,172
because they'll be there
right on your property."

859
01:15:14,056 --> 01:15:17,856
The honeybee belongs on every farm.

860
01:15:22,198 --> 01:15:27,203
Turning this crisis around
is not going to be easy

861
01:15:27,238 --> 01:15:29,330
and it won't happen overnight.

862
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:39,074
The bees are telling us to
become true caretakers

863
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:45,087
and the only solution is
creating a surrounding

864
01:15:45,122 --> 01:15:49,490
of wild flowers and forage and diversity.

865
01:15:54,830 --> 01:15:59,066
Spikenard Farm has been
not only a challenge

866
01:15:59,101 --> 01:16:05,131
but the variety of tasks for me
is just, at times, overwhelming.

867
01:16:07,843 --> 01:16:10,505
You can't manage everything alone.

868
01:16:13,115 --> 01:16:17,484
And the help from other human beings
and other beings has to come in.

869
01:16:20,189 --> 01:16:22,156
Even in two years now

870
01:16:22,191 --> 01:16:26,093
a much greater variety of
insects are coming back.

871
01:16:26,862 --> 01:16:29,063
It's very deeply satisfying.

872
01:16:29,098 --> 01:16:35,503
And honeybee sanctuaries are springing
up like mushrooms in this country.

873
01:16:42,311 --> 01:16:45,514
People have asked me, "Why
do you do what you're doing?

874
01:16:45,549 --> 01:16:47,616
Do you have hope with
all the mess we are in,

875
01:16:47,651 --> 01:16:50,210
with all we are doing in nature?"

876
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:55,624
And I would say I would have
hope to the very last day

877
01:16:55,659 --> 01:16:57,489
to the last plant.

878
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:08,469
The bees are the most exquisite beings.

879
01:17:08,504 --> 01:17:13,532
They show us what this
service can be like.
