 It was late and I didn't
 see no other cars,

 so I parked on the
 side of the road

 here and started urinating
 in the grass over there.

 Then three of them came running
 across the field right at me.

 they was Shriners.

 her to be honest in her claim

00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,340
 the day with his flatulence.
 

177
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,880
 I don't know what
 that boy was eating, 

178
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,480
 but it damn near
 cleared out the park. 

179
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,320
 Here's the homeless guy that
 Sylvester knifed in the gut. 

180
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,780
 [BLEEP]
 

181
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,570
 I mean, he's a lot of
 fun and all, Sylvester, 

182
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,100
 but he ain't too bright.
 

183
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,470
 We all covered for him though.
 

184
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,620
 Here's Bigfoot.
 

185
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,280
 We just caught a glimpse of
 him running through the trees. 

186
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,760
 They should have named
 him big ass though. 

187
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,920
 Just look at that
 thing, will you? 

188
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,600
 Ass the size of my kitchen.
 

189
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,960
 Kind of reminds me of a girl
 I beat the [BLEEP] out of. 

190
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,380
 Uh, I've been looking at
 these photographs Mr. Bowler, 

191
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,200
 and I don't see anything
 resembling a UFO. 

192
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,910
 I gotta build up
 to it, you [BLEEP]. 

193
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:58,240
 You don't want your viewers
 to die of shock, do you? 

194
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,130
 I can't just throw
 this evidence on them 

195
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,460
 without some sort
 of [BLEEP] build up. 

196
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,450
 Think of the lawsuits,
 you ignorant ass. 

197
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,560
 Of course, of course,
 of course, you're right. 

198
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,460
 Anyway, here's
 Elvis, the smoothest, 

199
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,100
 coolest, singing
 [BLEEP] that ever 

200
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,980
 walked on this [BLEEP] planet.
 

201
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,150
 Everybody thought he was dead,
 but I found him living high 

202
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:20,830
 off the hog up in the birch tree
 talking to the [BLEEP] birdies. 

203
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:23,850
 And now the evidence you've
 all been waiting for, 

204
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,070
 an actual photo
 of an alien craft 

205
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:29,320
 full of those little [BLEEP]
 space men just waiting to hop 

206
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,070
 out and screw us all over.
 

207
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,440
 Where is it?
 

208
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,330
 It's behind the trees.
 

209
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,130
 Behind the trees?
 

210
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,180
 How are we supposed to see
 if it's behind the trees? 

211
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,450
 Who do you think you're
 talking to you [BLEEP] yo-yo? 

212
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,980
 I don't know, I ought to
 break your damn neck for that. 

213
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,060
 [BLEEP] you're thinking
 of calling me a liar and-- 

214
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,560
 COMMANDER LYLE (ON
 RADIO): Houston, Houston 

215
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,060
 we have a problem.
 

216
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,530
 Houston, are you reading me?
 

217
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,500
 MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO):
 We read you, Commander Hacker. 

218
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,950
 What is your problem?
 

219
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,430
 COMMANDER LYLE (ON
 RADIO): This is Lyle. 

220
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,880
 Commander Hacker was just
 out-- he's doing his-- 

221
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,830
 he's outside the shuttle
 doing today's space walk. 

222
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,770
 He's trying to-- oh, god.
 

223
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,750
 Oh, god.
 

224
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,190
 MISSION CONTROL (ON
 RADIO): Commander Lyle, 

225
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,000
 stay calm and tell
 us what is happening. 

226
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,200
 COMMANDER LYLE (ON
 RADIO): Commander 

227
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,640
 Hacker, he was out doing a space
 walk and- and a ship hit him. 

228
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,630
 It was a big ship, real big.
 

229
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,940
 Oh, god.
 

230
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,360
 MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO):
 Commander Lyle, stay calm. 

231
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,070
 Did you say a ship?
 

232
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,410
 COMMANDER LYLE (ON RADIO):
 A ship, yeah, a UFO 

233
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,310
 man, a damn flying saucer.
 

234
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,900
 It flew by real close
 and Hacker's space suit 

235
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,540
 must have got caught
 on the ship's antenna. 

236
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,950
 He's gone, man.
 

237
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,740
 I can't believe it.
 

238
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,220
 Commander Schultz and
 Rodriguez are out there too 

239
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,860
 just shaking their heads.
 

240
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,080
 They can't believe it either.
 

241
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,450
 Oh, man.
 

242
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,740
 MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO):
 Hold on, Commander Lyle. 

243
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,370
 We're bringing in
 someone to advise. 

244
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:56,130
 Oh, and while we've got you
 Lyle, we have some bad news. 

245
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,200
 COMMANDER LYLE (ON RADIO): What?
 

246
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,510
 MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO):
 Your car was stolen last night. 

247
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,680
 COMMANDER LYLE (ON
 RADIO): Oh, man. 

248
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,110
 What else could go wrong?
 

249
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,490
 I can't believe it,
 I cannot believe it. 

250
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,360
 Oh, man.
 

251
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,110
 So you investigate like alien
 dudes and space ships and shit? 

252
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,020
 That's one way to put it.
 

253
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,200
 Damn dude, that's cool.
 

254
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,080
 Yo, this dude knows
 about space guys 

255
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,150
 and flying sauces and crap.
 

256
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,590
 That's another way to put it.
 

257
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,240
 That's a bunch of bullshit.
 

258
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,450
 I was in the war, goddammit.
 

259
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,970
 Yo, what's up with that
 new chick reporter, man? 

260
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:41,680
 What's her name, the one
 they brought on this season? 

261
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,480
 Christy Carmichael.
 

262
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,310
 The network thought we
 needed to add something 

263
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,300
 to boost the ratings,
 so the producers came up 

264
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,490
 with a couple of things.
 

265
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,470
 So then when I was
 11 years old my mother 

266
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,990
 put me in the Little
 Miss West Dundee contest 

267
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,900
 and I won first runner up.
 

268
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,140
 I knew from that moment
 that I was destined to have 

269
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,320
 a career in show business.
 

270
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,620
 PRODUCER: OK, um,
 Christy, we're ready. 

271
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,580
 Did you get the
 close up already? 

272
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,480
 PRODUCER: Uh, yeah, got it.
 

273
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,540
 OK, OK.
 

274
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,430
 PRODUCER: OK, and three, two--
 

275
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,750
 Hello, I'm Christy Carmichael
 and I'm standing here today 

276
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,690
 with George Ogden of
 Ogden Sky &quot;Obstervasen--&quot; 

277
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,180
 oh darn, I screwed it up.
 

278
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,550
 PRODUCER: Cut.
 

279
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:29,200
 Three, two--
 

280
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,180
 Hello, I'm Christy
 Carmichael and I'm 

281
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,010
 standing here today with
 George Ogden of Ogden Sky 

282
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:38,320
 Systems, Observation Systems.
 

283
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,090
 Oh, this is hard, and I'm
 not even blonde anymore. 

284
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:47,050
 Hi, I'm Christy and I'm
 standing here today with George 

285
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,860
 Olson of Ogden Sky--
 

286
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,660
 PRODUCER: It's Ogden.
 

287
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,630
 His name is Ogden.
 

288
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,850
 Oh, shoot.
 

289
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,930
 I'm so sorry Mr Olson.
 

290
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:54,730
 PRODUCER: Ogden!
 

291
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,590
 Sometimes I get really
 excited about my work 

292
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:02,000
 and my heart just beats so fast
 it gets hard to concentrate. 

293
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,300
 I see what you mean.
 

294
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,210
 PRODUCER: Christy,
 I have an idea. 

295
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,470
 [THEME MUSIC]
 

296
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:24,040
 Hi, I'm Christy, and you are?
 

297
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,950
 I'm George, George Ogden.
 

298
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,910
 And what is that
 you do, Mr Ogden? 

299
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,500
 I own Ogden Sky
 Observation Systems. 

300
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,890
 And what is it
 that you observe? 

301
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,770
 Well, what we do is make sky
 scanning software that can 

302
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,800
 be used in conjunction with--
 

303
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,050
 Ooh, that sounds technical.
 

304
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,590
 You must be very smart.
 

305
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,380
 Oh, well I don't
 know about that. 

306
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,370
 Isn't it true that
 you recently went 

307
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,830
 through a devastating divorce?
 

308
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:47,630
 What?
 

309
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,600
 All right, I want
 to know one thing, 

310
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,810
 you've got to be
 straight with me. 

311
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,070
 Yeah, what's that?
 

312
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,250
 You news guys smoke
 a lot of weed, right? 

313
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,370
 What?
 

314
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,010
 I'm just fucking with you, dog.
 

315
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,630
 Do you?
 

316
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,450
 I can't speak for
 everybody in the industry, 

317
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,450
 but as for myself,
 absolutely not. 

318
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:18,110
 Come on, what about
 Peter Jennings? 

319
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,010
 Well, he might.
 

320
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,030
 All right, look, is
 this shit for real? 

321
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,970
 I mean, like this show
 you're on, is it serious? 

322
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,680
 Well, the producers
 take it seriously. 

323
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,130
 I take it seriously.
 

324
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,710
 But I have to admit there are
 a few people on the show that 

325
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,970
 think a little differently.
 

326
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,990
 After the break we
 will answer the age 

327
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,260
 old question, what do
 alien visitors do with all 

328
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,560
 that livestock genitalia.
 

329
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,790
 So don't go away, we'll
 be right back you stupid, 

330
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,420
 gullible fucks.
 

331
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,840
 PRODUCER: OK, so we'll just edit
 that last part out, shall we? 

332
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,180
 Hey, whatever.
 

333
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,720
 It's your show.
 

334
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,790
 Can I get some mouthwash?
 

335
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,550
 Just saying those words
 makes me feel like I've 

336
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,160
 been sucking someone's ass.
 

337
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,600
 Good one, man.
 

338
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,330
 Hey, hey, you're fucking fired.
 

339
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:18,060
 And now it's time for this
 week's celebrity alien report. 

340
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,240
 Uh yeah listen, I don't know
 what you want from my life 

341
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,640
 really, but I'm a very busy man.
 

342
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,040
 I've got things going on, I'm
 working on my tour and stuff, 

343
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,390
 so I really don't have time to
 be interviewed about aliens. 

344
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,010
 Not that I don't believe
 in aliens, because I 

345
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,640
 do believe in aliens,
 I just don't have time 

346
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,390
 to talk about it right now.
 

347
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,130
 Aliens are a very big part of
 my life, as a matter of fact. 

348
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,420
 I have many friends
 in Los Angeles 

349
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,260
 that are of the alien race.
 

350
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,910
 There's many different
 species of aliens, 

351
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,090
 but I don't want to get into it
 because it's all too confusing. 

352
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,050
 I mean, there's the
 ones with six fingers, 

353
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,250
 there's the ones
 with three heads, 

354
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,670
 there's the tall skinny
 ones, the short, fat ones. 

355
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,360
 Everybody knows this.
 

356
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,470
 There's Michael Jackson.
 

357
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,520
 So I mean, there's really,
 there's all different breeds, 

358
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,820
 you know.
 

359
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,820
 Hello, my name is Dr. EG Nog.
 

360
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,680
 I study the UFO
 phenomenon full time, 

361
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,150
 and it was I who
 developed the three levels 

362
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,360
 of encounters listed here.
 

363
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,110
 Encounter type 1,
 sighting a UFO. 

364
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:21,550
 Encounter type 2, physical
 evidence left behind by a UFO, 

365
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:28,510
 and the third type, contact
 with alien being from a UFO. 

366
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,840
 My original list actually
 consisted of 10 levels 

367
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,740
 of encounters, but the
 scientific community 

368
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,570
 only adopted the first three.
 

369
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,020
 Now this has been
 a sore spot with me 

370
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,770
 ever since, because as you can
 see, the levels of encounters 

371
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:48,150
 become increasingly more
 specific as you go along. 

372
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,440
 Why would they want encounter
 type 1, a simple sighting, when 

373
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,620
 they could have encounter
 type five, which is gently 

374
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,580
 rubbing an alien's flesh?
 

375
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,510
 And why should, why
 should physical evidence 

376
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,390
 be so important when they could
 have encounter type six, where 

377
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,080
 an alien walks up
 to you very nicely, 

378
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,190
 but then smashes you over
 the head with a board. 

379
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,730
 Huh?
 

380
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,370
 And finally the
 clincher, encounter 

381
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:17,590
 type 3, contact with alien
 beings, face to face meeting. 

382
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,700
 Big deal.
 

383
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,210
 It can't hold a candle to
 encounter type nine, where 

384
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,800
 aliens move into
 your neighborhood 

385
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:29,040
 and they play the stereo so loud
 that nobody can get any sleep. 

386
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,950
 Oh, my.
 

387
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,050
 I'm sorry.
 

388
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:37,540
 Look, write your congressman.
 

389
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,540
 Tell them you want
 all the facts. 

390
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,600
 Hell, I'm Al Manac.
 

391
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,380
 I'm here at the National
 Aeronautics and Space 

392
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,600
 Administration,
 also known as NASA. 

393
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,240
 I'm here with Brian Johnson,
 who's the new project leader 

394
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,060
 for the new Mars Rover program.
 

395
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,180
 Hello, Brian.
 

396
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,560
 Hey.
 

397
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,970
 Uh Brian, I just got to ask.
 

398
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,500
 You seem kind of young to be
 in such a position of power. 

399
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,510
 Yeah, but I won the
 contest, so here I am. 

400
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,650
 What contest?
 

401
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,450
 You didn't see it?
 

402
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,110
 It's the show on Fox
 last spring, &quot;Who 

403
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,740
 Wants to be a Project Leader.&quot;
 

404
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,670
 That's where I've seen you?
 

405
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,440
 That was for NASA?
 

406
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,240
 Yeah.
 

407
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,640
 I was also on a show called
 &quot;Who Wants to be a Criminal,&quot; 

408
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,620
 but I lost that one.
 

409
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,220
 Good thing too,
 because the guy who won 

410
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,030
 is doing 10 years
 in San Quentin. 

411
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,730
 OK, so you have no idea what
 we're talking about here. 

412
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,120
 None whatsoever.
 

413
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,540
 But I am signed up to do a
 show next summer called &quot;Who 

414
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,100
 Wants to Make Love to Madonna.&quot;
 

415
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,230
 And the odds are pretty
 good, because there's 

416
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,730
 supposed to be 150 winners.
 

417
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,060
 I am just wasting my time here.
 

418
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,800
 Pretty much, but I did
 find this video in a drawer. 

419
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,240
 It's pretty crazy, you
 might want to check it out. 

420
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,040

 could adjust it.

 will give you instructions

 for the adjustment.

 I'm not supposed to give
 out that information.

742
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,820
 The film is of an aircraft

 argue with experts?

 first thing we do 

751
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,740
 is examine the film
 stock to make sure 

752
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,530
 that it was
 available in the time 

753
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:47,930
 that they claim that the film
 was shot, which in this case 

754
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:51,110
 was 1948, I believe.
 

755
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:55,770
 The film stock was quite
 available at that time. 

756
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,610

00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:15,630
 It was the night
 Mitch proposed to me. 

857
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:16,430
 She said no.
 

858
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:20,440
 We just parked the car and
 watched for about 10 minutes. 

859
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,270
 Why do you have to
 tell people that? 

860
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:24,280
 Is it anybody's business?
 

861
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,080
 Sorry.
 

862
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,210
 You're a real
 prick, you know that. 

863
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:29,070
 Ah, shit!
 

864
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:30,780
 I'm waiting in the car.
 

865
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,580
 Ah!
 

866
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,660
 COMMANDER LYLE (ON
 RADIO): Houston! 

867
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,710
 Come in, Houston.
 

868
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:43,390
 Houston, for god's
 sake, come in! 

869
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:44,920
 MISSION CONTROL 2 (ON

870
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,510
 Go ahead, Commander Hacker.
 

871
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,010
 COMMANDER LYLE (ON
 RADIO): This is Lyle! 

872
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:49,810
 I already told you.
 

873
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:51,740
 What the hell is
 going on down there? 

874
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:54,840
 I told you an hour
 ago, Hacker is gone. 

875
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,610
 Rodriquez is gone.
 

876
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:58,630
 And they just came
 back for Schultz. 

877
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:00,460
 MISSION CONTROL 2 (ON RADIO):
 Uh, sorry Commander Lyle, 

878
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,410
 nobody told me anything.
 

879
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:04,330
 We just had our shift change.
 

880
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:05,710
 COMMANDER LYLE (ON
 RADIO): Oh, man! 

881
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,570
 What is wrong with
 you people down there? 

882
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:09,900
 They're going to
 come after me next. 

883
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,130
 Where is Professor Grubbles?
 

884
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,230
 MISSION CONTROL
 2 (ON RADIO): Uh, 

885
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,080
 Professor Grubbles was
 found dead in the elevator 

886
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,300
 not 20 minutes ago.
 

887
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,790
 COMMANDER LYLE (ON
 RADIO): Oh, man! 

888
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:19,420
 MISSION CONTROL 2 (ON
 RADIO): Uh, Commander Lyle, 

889
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:22,370
 did you hear about your car?
 

890
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:23,530
 Yeah, I can't believe it.
 

891
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,740
 MISSION CONTROL 2 (ON RADIO):
 They think it was your fiance. 

892
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:29,770
 Someone says they saw her drive
 off in it with another guy. 

893
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:31,770
 COMMANDER LYLE (ON
 RADIO): Good god! 

894
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:35,730
 This is the single worst
 day I have ever had. 

895
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:36,530
 Oh, man.
 

896
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:37,940
 This is unbelievable.
 

897
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,920
 Excuse me.
 

898
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,220
 Are your restrooms in the back?
 

899
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,610
 Straight back, end of the hall.
 

900
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:47,700
 Thank you.
 

901
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,650
 Don't mention it.
 

902
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:53,070
 And there are no video
 cameras in the heating vents. 

903
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:54,610
 What?
 

904
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:55,410
 Nothing.
 

905
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,590
 Hey, have you ever done
 a story on Roswell? 

906
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:07,810
 Roswell, New Mexico?
 

907
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:10,790
 Yeah, you know where that
 space ship crashed like in 1947. 

908
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:12,050
 You ever been there?
 

909
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:14,760
 Sort of.
 

910
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,580
 God, nobody's going to
 believe this is New Mexico. 

911
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:23,350
 Now wasn't that fantastic?
 

912
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:24,790
 And now this.
 

913
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:31,430
 [URINATING]
 

914
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:36,900
 Oh, we're ready?
 

915
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,840
 All right.
 

916
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,530
 See, me and Ralph was
 fishing at this lake 

917
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:45,090
 when a small craft, about
 the size of my mobile home, 

918
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:47,650
 came up over them
 tree tops over there. 

919
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:50,330
 This beam of light
 flashed out of it. 

920
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,770
 It was really something to see.
 

921
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:55,460
 Then real sudden like
 these two spaceman-- 

922
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,800
 and I knew that's
 what they was, they 

923
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,880
 was spacemen-- they came running
 up and they grabbed Ralph. 

924
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,760
 They dragged him off
 into that clearing. 

925
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,350
 Then that light hit them
 again and they was gone. 

926
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:07,640
 Tell you what,
 man, they startled 

927
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,940
 me so bad I almost left.
 

928
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:13,070
 I stuck with it, caught
 me a few more fish. 

929
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,390
 Nothing worth keeping really.
 

930
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:17,320
 So I was packing up, getting
 ready to go when I heard 

931
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,010
 this loud clap of thunder.
 

932
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:21,570
 Looked up, I saw Ralph
 falling through them trees, 

933
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,030
 hitting every branch
 all the way down. 

934
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:27,160
 He had a bad cut on his cheek
 and his wrist was broke. 

935
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,970
 He was shook up, but overall
 in pretty good shape. 

936
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:31,840
 We ate at Manny's.
 

937
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:36,280
 Me and Ralph was
 hunting squirrels 

938
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:40,210
 in this general area when we
 heard this great rush of air. 

939
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:42,660
 And we looked up, saw that ship.
 

940
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,000
 It was the same one
 we ran into before. 

941
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,060
 A white flash of
 light came out of it. 

942
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,520
 Ralph just started
 running from the Jeep. 

943
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,440
 These two space guys appeared
 right in front of him 

944
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,140
 and wrestled him to the ground.
 

945
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:57,480
 Then that light hit them
 again and they was gone. 

946
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,770
 Tell you what, it scared me
 so bad I had to sit right down 

947
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:02,690
 and have me a beer
 right there on the spot. 

948
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:04,510
 I got pretty lucky
 after that, though. 

949
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:06,950
 Caught me six more squirrels.
 

950
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:10,060
 Then I heard this funny
 little ringing sound. 

951
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,250
 I wasn't quite sure
 what it was at first. 

952
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:13,420
 It just turned out
 to be somebody's 

953
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:18,530
 pet cat had a little bell on
 its collar, so I shot it too. 

954
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:19,980
 Then I heard that
 thunder clap again, 

955
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,140
 and Ralph hit the ground.
 

956
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,960
 He had a concussion,
 dislocated shoulder. 

957
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,440
 Nothing too serious.
 

958
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:29,990
 So we pitched camp and ate
 a few of the squirrels. 

959
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:34,640
 In a moment of confusion
 Ralph ate the cat. 

960
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,770
 Something was
 nibbling on my butt. 

961
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:43,150
 Me and Ralph was on this
 weekend hiking trip you know, 

962
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:46,450
 throwing rocks at
 campers and whatnot. 

963
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:50,130
 We saw that same ship come up
 over them bluffs over there. 

964
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:53,420
 Ralph just started cussing
 and heading off down the path 

965
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,500
 when this big space guy
 appeared in front of him 

966
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,520
 and clotheslined him right
 there at the bottom of the hill. 

967
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,590
 Took him down real quick.
 

968
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:03,140
 Then that light hit them
 again and they was gone. 

969
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:05,780
 I was pretty used
 to it by now, so I 

970
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,420
 just built me a little cooking
 fire and broke out the Spam. 

971
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,580
 I'd ate me about a
 can and a half spam 

972
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,120
 when I heard that
 clap of thunder. 

973
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,720
 So I looked up and
 around to see where 

974
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,220
 Ralph would hit the ground at.
 

975
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:20,070
 Saw him coming down
 those bluffs over there. 

976
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:22,990
 His jaw and legs was broke,
 and I was pretty sure he 

977
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:25,510
 had some internal injuries.
 

978
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:27,370
 So I finished up my
 other can of spam 

979
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:30,120
 and took him straight
 to the emergency room. 

980
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:34,120
 He pulled through though,
 he's a real trooper. 

981
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,490
 I don't know what's gotten
 into him lately, though. 

982
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:40,270
 He just don't want to
 seem to do anything. 

983
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:42,740
 Guys might want to be careful,
 you're standing in poison oak, 

984
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:43,540
 there.
 

985
00:48:55,110 --> 00:49:00,400
 My first sexual experience,
 I was 12 years old, 

986
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,570
 Shawnee Pines Youth Camp.
 

987
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:06,920
 Ruth Ann was 14.
 

988
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,650
 Vacuum cleaner was brand new.

00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:14,910

 you talking about? 

990
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:21,330

991
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:22,130
 Oh, shit.
 

992
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:31,000
 I was shot three fucking times.
 

993
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,620
 Excuse me, um, I don't
 want to alarm anyone, 

994
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,700
 but there's a guy
 laying in the hall. 

995
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,080
 You might want to call 911.
 

996
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,820
 I mean, he's not even breathing.
 

997
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:43,800
 Oh, thanks.

 we keep him, Mr.

 a riot with his wild stories.

 Yeah, he's crazy as a-- uh.

 Is he dangerous?

00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:33,780
 Dangerous?
 

1010
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,620
 This guy wants to know
 if he's dangerous. 

1011

 You want to know
 if he's dangerous?

 No, not really.

 He's just crazy as shit.
 

1015

 I mean, you know,
 he's really crazy.

 Yeah, he talks a
 lot of crazy shit.

 or else you wouldn't be here.

01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:40,810
 Yeah, all right.
 

1196
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:42,940
 So you can put in a
 good word for me, right? 

1197
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:45,080
 As many words as you need.
 

1198
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,840
 Fuckin' A, dude.
 

1199
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:47,760
 Yes.
 

1200
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:48,560
 All right.
 

1201
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:51,170
 So tell me about the
 people you work with. 

1202
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:54,170
 Oh, do I have to?
 

1203
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,610
 Albert.
 

1204
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:03,970
 Can I have a word with you?
 

1205
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:06,990
 Actually Larry, I'm working on
 this midget transvestite crop 

1206
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:09,580
 circle thing and I really don't
 have the time, I've got to go. 

1207
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:10,380
 Oh, nonsense.
 

1208
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:11,430
 It will only take a minute.
 

1209
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:26,220
 Albert, I'd like you
 to meet Dick Skyward. 

1210
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,280
 Mr. Skyward.
 

1211
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,280
 Oh, please call me Dick.
 

1212
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,080
 I'm sure I will.
 

1213
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,280
 Larry, what's this all about?
 

1214
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,270
 Albert, have a seat.
 

1215
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:38,960
 Albert, Dick is a new employee.
 

1216
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,180
 He's also a psychic.
 

1217
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:43,870
 I think he might be able to
 help out on your investigations. 

1218
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:45,490
 Whoa, whoa Larry.
 

1219
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:48,270
 No offense to you, but
 I've always worked alone 

1220
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:50,270
 and I just don't
 believe in psychics. 

1221
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:51,510
 Horse crap.
 

1222
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:52,650
 I've seen Dick in action.
 

1223
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:54,090
 He's the real deal.
 

1224
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:56,140
 And I asked around
 and I was repeatedly 

1225
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:59,160
 told that if I wanted
 results I would only 

1226
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:02,350
 be happy with Dick Skyward.
 

1227
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:06,220
 I can read a person's thoughts,
 given enough time and money. 

1228
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:08,330
 And that's why he needs
 to be out there with you, 

1229
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:10,250
 so he can tell if people
 are telling the truth 

1230
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:13,740
 or lying to your
 face immediately. 

1231
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:18,600
 If someone is lying to you
 then I'll know it, and then bam. 

1232
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,920
 Bam?
 

1233
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,820
 Bam.
 

1234
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:23,760
 What the hell is &quot;bam?&quot;
 

1235
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,370
 Well, it's you know,
 &quot;bam,&quot; they're lying. 

1236
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:29,830
 And then what, we don't
 let them on the show? 

1237
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:30,630
 What?
 

1238
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:31,970
 Of course we do.
 

1239
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:34,030
 I mean, if I took all
 the liars off this show 

1240
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:37,390
 I'd have nothing but
 an hour of Max Harmon. 

1241
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:38,190
 Ooh.
 

1242
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,480
 Hello, and welcome to
 the &quot;Max Harmon Hour.&quot; 

1243
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,430
 I'm your host, Max Harmon.
 

1244
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:48,660
 Today I'm going to share with
 you one of my favorite hobbies, 

1245
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:51,550
 the ancient art of origami.
 

1246
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:55,900
 Now origami is a lot of fun
 and a great stress reliever. 

1247
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,170
 Today I'm going to show
 you a quick example 

1248
01:02:58,170 --> 01:02:59,860
 that you can try at home.
 

1249
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:04,230
 Now you take an 8 1/2
 by 11 sheet of paper. 

1250
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:07,910
 There are all kinds of animals
 that you can make with origami. 

1251
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:10,980
 You can make an elephant,
 a horse, a kumquat, 

1252
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:14,800
 but today I'm going to share
 with you one of my favorites. 

1253
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:19,150
 [PAPER RUSTLING]
 

1254
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:19,950
 The bird.
 

1255
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:31,440
 Actually, I may have something
 there, maybe for Showtime. 

1256
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,370
 I just don't see the point.
 

1257
01:03:33,370 --> 01:03:37,480
 Albert, I'm going
 to level with you. 

1258
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,410
 The quality of your work
 is slipping, slipping. 

1259
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:44,760
 Your material is suffering.
 

1260
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:47,520
 I'm the only one who cares
 about the damn material. 

1261
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,020
 Yes.
 

1262
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:50,630
 Yes what?
 

1263
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:51,740
 Yes.
 

1264
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:54,410
 I want you to take Dick
 out in the field with you. 

1265
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:56,910
 Show him the ropes.
 

1266
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:59,270
 Take Dick in hand.
 

1267
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:01,080
 I don't want to.
 

1268
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:01,970
 I do want you to.
 

1269
01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:03,570
 -No.
 -Yes. 

1270
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:04,440
 No.
 

1271
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,240
 Yes.
 

1272
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,780
 Wait, I'm sensing something.
 

1273
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:09,460
 What is it?
 

1274
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:12,120
 Tension.
 

1275
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,380
 Eh?
 

1276
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:15,770
 Did I tell You he's amazing.
 

1277
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:16,570
 That'll be $50.
 

1278
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:23,950
 Are you a believer now, Albert?
 

1279
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:24,870
 Oh, yeah.
 

1280
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:26,280
 I believe.
 

1281
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,350
 I believe I'll leave.
 

1282
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:32,540
 Albert.
 

1283
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:36,350
 I will have my way on this one.
 

1284
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:37,430
 Now you're angry.
 

1285
01:04:40,030 --> 01:04:41,490
 Damn boy, you're
 going to clean me out. 

1286
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:50,610
 Excuse me, Max.
 

1287
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:52,310
 Al, I'm glad you ran into me.
 

1288
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:56,300
 What is this shit that
 you're giving me to air? 

1289
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,230
 I'm really not
 in the mood, Max. 

1290
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:00,340
 Oh, oh, oh, you're not, huh?
 

1291
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:02,760
 Well, let me tell
 you the kind of mood 

1292
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,520
 that I'm in when I have to
 air some of the segments. 

1293
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,710
 I feel like I'm out
 there in the breeze, 

1294
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:12,170
 swinging like a
 monkey's nut sack. 

1295
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:13,400
 I don't know if
 it's going to work 

1296
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,580
 or it's going to be a
 complete disappointment 

1297
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:17,690
 like last night's hooker.
 

1298
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:20,240
 You should write
 children's book. 

1299
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,190
 Shut the fuck up.
 

1300
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:24,580
 I know you have
 some, some little bit 

1301
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:26,700
 of control over these stories.
 

1302
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:29,020
 What are you working on now?
 

1303
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:32,250
 Actually, I'm working on this
 midget transvestite who found 

1304
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:33,860
 some crop circles down south.
 

1305
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:37,850
 That's pretty good.
 

1306
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:38,980
 I like that.
 

1307
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:39,780
 Let's go with it.
 

1308
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,970
 You're Max Harmon.
 

1309
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:57,160
 Now let's visit
 the UFO Research 

1310
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:00,350
 Laboratory in Houston, Texas.
 

1311
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:03,530
 Golly, what fun.
 

1312
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:06,400
 Welcome, my name is
 Electric Sammy, director 

1313
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,840
 of the UFO Research Laboratory.
 

1314
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:11,090
 Our job here is to collect
 physical evidence left 

1315
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:14,340
 behind by alien visitation.
 

1316
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:16,050
 This jacket was
 worn by a man who 

1317
01:06:16,050 --> 01:06:19,590
 was abducted and actually taken
 aboard an alien ship in March 

1318
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:21,040
 of 1984.
 

1319
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:23,770
 Fascinating.
 

1320
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:25,370
 This wallet was
 found in a heavily 

1321
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:27,630
 forested area in Indiana.
 

1322
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:30,590
 You can see the slight burn
 marks on the one side here. 

1323
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:32,220
 We feel the owner
 was incinerated 

1324
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:34,550
 by alien weapons of some kind.
 

1325
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:37,550
 And to show just how clever
 these non-human intelligence 

1326
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:41,070
 can be, they removed
 all identification. 

1327
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,990
 This is a tape recorder that
 actually captured the sounds 

1328
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:50,490
 of an alien craft landing in
 a wheat field in southern Ohio 

1329
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:52,630
 earlier this year.
 

1330
01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:54,940
 The tape, however,
 was never found. 

1331
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:57,500
 We feel there may have been
 some alien intervention there as 

1332
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:58,840
 well.
 

1333
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:01,140
 I am in hell.
 

1334
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:02,370
 Is this hell?
 

1335
01:07:02,370 --> 01:07:03,790
 Is that what this is?
 

1336
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:06,810
 I just want to know where I
 am, that's all, because-- no, 

1337
01:07:06,810 --> 01:07:09,510
 this definitely hell.
 

1338
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:11,560
 I got to tell you, dude, this
 has been the most interesting 

1339
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:14,800
 day I've had since I
 got my nipples pierced, 

1340
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:18,050
 only with less itching.
 

1341
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:20,250
 I honestly don't know
 what to say about that. 

1342
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,110
 Hey man, I'm going to use the
 can before I start my shift. 

1343
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:26,910
 Sure thing.
 

1344
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:29,300
 Watch out for Marty back there.
 

1345
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:30,680
 Is he dead again?
 

1346
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,600
 All right, it's
 five o'clock, dude. 

1347
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,630
 Time for me to hit the streets.
 

1348
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:38,110
 You got a card or something?
 

1349
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:40,760
 Yeah, sure.
 

1350
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:43,680
 All right, I'm going
 to call you, dude. 

1351
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:47,340
 Me and you, we're going to
 be a hell of a team, dog. 

1352
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:48,790
 Hell is the word for it.
 

1353
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:54,790
 You rock, bro.
 

1354
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:03,380
 Thank you for the
 coffee, Colonel Fleeton. 

1355
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:05,050
 Not at all.
 

1356
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:06,300
 Are you nervous?
 

1357
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:07,100
 A little.
 

1358
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:10,720
 I haven't talked
 about this before. 

1359
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,100
 We don't go live very often.
 

1360
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:17,480
 I'm a little nervous,
 but I think I'll be OK. 

1361
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:18,740
 PRODUCER: OK, we're
 set to go live

1365
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,750
 Colonel Fleeton, may
 I call you Timothy? 

1366
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:42,000
 That's fine.
 

1367
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,250
 Or do you prefer just Tim?
 

1368
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:46,330
 No, no, Timothy.
 

1369
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:47,130
 OK.
 

1370
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:51,600
 I didn't know since Timothy
 sounds a little feminine. 

1371
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,820
 So Timothy, you are a
 former officer for our Air 

1372
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:59,110
 Force, not our Air
 Force, but you know, 

1373
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:00,920
 the United States Air Force.
 

1374
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:03,630
 Yes, I served from
 1965 until 1980. 

1375
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:05,400
 Wow, that's so cool.
 

1376
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:08,250
 My mom always said that Air
 Force guys made great lovers 

1377
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:09,430
 because they really
 knew how to use 

1378
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:12,080
 the stick between their legs.
 

1379
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,980
 Do you think that is true?
 

1380
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:16,490
 I can't say.
 

1381
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:20,450
 So Colonel Fleeton, you say
 that on numerous occasions 

1382
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:24,860
 while flying around or whatever,
 you saw some of those-- what 

1383
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:27,820
 do you call them-- UFO things.
 

1384
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:30,830
 Yes I was witness to
 several strange occurrences 

1385
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:32,660
 that I made full reports of.
 

1386
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:35,350
 Later, the government classified
 those documents and they 

1387
01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:36,560
 have until this very date--
 

1388
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,700
 This is really good coffee.
 

1389
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:40,190
 Did you make it?
 

1390
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:41,820
 No.
 

1391
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:44,010
 Oh darn, I spilled.
 

1392
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:45,680
 It's OK, I can keep going.
 

1393
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:49,610
 Let me just get this off.
 

1394
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:54,050
 So Colonel Fleeton, what do
 you think these objects are? 

1395
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:58,290
 Well, my breast guess is that
 they're foreign in nature. 

1396
01:09:58,290 --> 01:10:02,200
 Oh, did I spill on that too?
 

1397
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,320
 Let me just slip this off.

 questioned my supervisors,
