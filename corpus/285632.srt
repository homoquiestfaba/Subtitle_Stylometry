1
00:00:27,067 --> 00:00:32,567
Recent newspaper headlines have
planted questions in our minds.

2
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:40,067
Will Gen. Su****** be Thailand's
next Prime Minister?

3
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:45,567
The nation is up in arms
as he prepares...

4
00:00:46,078 --> 00:00:50,078
...to sacrifice his honour
for the nation

5
00:00:51,078 --> 00:00:54,078
and break his pre-election
promise not to seek office

6
00:00:54,578 --> 00:00:59,578
and to return the nation
to democracy.

7
00:01:01,578 --> 00:01:11,078
After general elections,
the five majority parties:

8
00:01:11,578 --> 00:01:17,289
Sama***, Cha** Th**, Social *****,
Thai Citi*** and Ras***don

9
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,789
...backed Gen. Su*****da as
the nation's 19th Prime Minister.

10
00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:28,289
Hundreds of students and civilians
have gathered...

11
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:34,289
...in front of Parliament
to protest.

12
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:39,789
Protein, Carbohydrates, Fat,
Minerals and Vitamins.

13
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:50,289
Smelling Salts, Cold Chaser,
Headache Easer.

14
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:54,289
Monkey Silver Ball Brand
Smelling Salts.

15
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:56,789
In the recording studio.

16
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:08,789
It's not the sound of
forest floods.

17
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:11,789
Weighing 114 pounds.

18
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:19,289
SAYEW

19
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:41,289
Sayew

20
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:46,789
A copy of "You and I", please.

21
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:48,289
This is a hot issue.

22
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:50,789
You'd be out of luck
if I didn't save you one.

23
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:52,289
Wow! What a hunk!

24
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:06,289
These two, please.

25
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:12,789
Star Soccer's 15. Sayew's now 35.
50 Baht total.

26
00:03:13,048 --> 00:03:13,789
Do you want a bag?

27
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:15,789
Yes. Yes, please.

28
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:29,789
Real Sex Encounters.

29
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:35,789
My name is Tao. I'm from Sukhothai
but moved to Bangkok to go to University.

30
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:41,789
I live with my Aunt who runs a
restaurant in our apartment building.

31
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:49,289
Whenever I'm free, I help wash
dishes and deliver food.

32
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,789
The restaurant is a centre of sorts
that has let me meet a variety...

33
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:53,289
...of people.

34
00:04:59,753 --> 00:05:04,776
Daeng is a night angel, renting
a room down the hall.

35
00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:10,481
She's the hottest thing to
a country boy like me.

36
00:05:11,085 --> 00:05:18,789
The sexy sway of her sweet slabby
ass sets my heart on fire.

37
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:23,789
Her bountiful breasts
beg for my attention.

38
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:29,789
Their quivering bounce simply
leaves me breathless.

39
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:35,789
One day, she ordered food as usual.

40
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:38,789
It was my job to deliver it.

41
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:44,289
When she opened the door,
she was in her nightie.

42
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:50,289
And beneath that,
she was completely naked.

43
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:52,289
Can you imagine my excitement?

44
00:05:52,290 --> 00:06:00,289
She didn't shy away as my staring eyes
took in her luscious body.

45
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:06,789
The hunger in my eyes
begged her to ask.

46
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:10,289
Would you like to know
what I do for a living?

47
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:12,789
I don't know.
I avoided the question.

48
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:19,289
I didn't ask if you knew
but if you want to know.

49
00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:22,789
I nodded my head
but averted my gaze.

50
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:26,789
She was silent
but smiled seductively...

51
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:31,789
and pulled me into her arms
and kissed me on the lips.

52
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:35,289
I shuddered.
She laughed with glee.

53
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:39,289
There you go. That's my job.

54
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:55,789
I was surprised and tried to run
but she laughed and pulled me back.

55
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:00,789
Don't be scared. I won't bite.

56
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:03,289
But this is my first time.

57
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:06,789
Everyone has a first time.

58
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:17,789
That night she schooled me
in the sutras of sex...

59
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:21,789
...how to love and
kiss like an exper...

60
00:07:57,289 --> 00:07:58,789
Tao, your Aunt needs
you to deliver food.

61
00:07:59,289 --> 00:07:59,789
Okay.

62
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:13,789
Wet Dreams

63
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:18,289
These are Sayew's editorial suites.

64
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:23,289
Sayew is the kind of mag that stirs
the tiger in your loins.

65
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:26,289
This here is...What's his name?

66
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:27,289
Fuck it.

67
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:30,289
Here's Seed. Our layout designer.

68
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:33,289
He's cut and pasted until
his hands are stuck.

69
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:40,289
And Knorr Not Nor, owner of
7 serials. Each one a classic.

70
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:41,789
He's also our photo editor.

71
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,289
These aren't censored yet.
They're off limits.

72
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:46,789
Not even a peek?

73
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:51,789
This is Kajorn. The old hand here.

74
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:55,289
Tao, come here.

75
00:08:55,789 --> 00:08:59,289
He's everyone's mentor
and designs the cover.

76
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,289
There's also Dr. Porn...

77
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:07,289
...who writes his sex help
column from home.

78
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:12,789
Our staff may be small but
we're a brilliant bunch.

79
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:16,789
I'm not a baby anymore.
We have it all. Be it fashion,

80
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,289
factual entertainment...

81
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:21,789
...foreign and domestic news.

82
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:29,289
Our best column prints sex stories
submitted by our readers.

83
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:34,289
But the bulk of them are trash.
Literary drivel.

84
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:38,789
That's why Hia hired me, Tao,
as his star writer.

85
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:58,289
Hia Kung Fu. Everyone calls him that.
He's been a porn dog for decades.

86
00:09:59,289 --> 00:10:02,789
Tao, this ain't cutting it.

87
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:06,789
Why's that?
It's just like all the rest.

88
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:11,289
That's the problem. Don't you get
what our readers want?

89
00:10:11,789 --> 00:10:19,789
They want more details down to
the pubes.

90
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:24,789
So they can get off.

91
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:30,289
Graphic sex.
The kinkier the better.

92
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:39,289
Long stories short on sex
like yours are getting old.

93
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:49,789
It was cool before.
It even gave our magazine class.

94
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:54,289
But let's be straight.
Right now our sales suck...

95
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:56,289
and my backers called me in.

96
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:03,789
If you can't raise the heat in your
stories, I'll have to drop you.

97
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,789
But I'll give you a break.

98
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:08,289
The onus is on you.

99
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:12,289
You've got to produce what
the market demands.

100
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:19,289
But my writing's graphic.
My hand trembles just from typing.

101
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:23,293
Your writing? Graphic?

102
00:11:23,793 --> 00:11:25,793
This is graphic.

103
00:11:26,793 --> 00:11:29,793
Our new writer Young Stallion.

104
00:11:30,793 --> 00:11:35,793
His stories are so graphic they've...

105
00:11:36,293 --> 00:11:38,793
...turned our readers blissfully pale.
"Life is Short, So Enjoy the Ride"

106
00:11:46,293 --> 00:11:47,793
And I thrust ferociously into her.

107
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:52,293
Where's the art in that? This is
crude and lacks literary style.

108
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:56,793
That's my point.
You write like a girl.

109
00:11:57,293 --> 00:11:59,293
Think like a man
or give it up, girl.

110
00:11:59,793 --> 00:12:06,793
Save your stories
for trashy romances.

111
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:13,293
Tits and ass.
Men blow buckets from them.

112
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:20,293
Hia, red alert! We're about to shoot
and our tits are gone.

113
00:12:20,793 --> 00:12:24,793
Stallion was chatting her up
and then she was gone.

114
00:12:28,293 --> 00:12:29,793
I forgot about these two.

115
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:34,793
On the left is Pai, our photographer
who loves country music.

116
00:12:35,293 --> 00:12:37,793
On the right is Mah,
our giant stylist.

117
00:12:38,293 --> 00:12:40,793
She has a pimply back
but thinks she's a star.

118
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:47,793
What the hell!
That rack'o'tits ain't no pussycat.

119
00:12:47,794 --> 00:12:49,293
How'd she disappear?

120
00:12:49,793 --> 00:12:53,293
These two work and
fight all day long.

121
00:12:58,293 --> 00:13:00,293
I'm done with this month's serial.

122
00:13:07,793 --> 00:13:10,793
Same story again.
Go change the title.

123
00:13:11,293 --> 00:13:19,793
Our readers will catch on.
Seed used this just last month.

124
00:13:23,293 --> 00:13:24,793
Here's the next cover.

125
00:13:24,794 --> 00:13:31,793
Excellent. In big bold type.

126
00:13:32,793 --> 00:13:33,293
Big bold type.

127
00:13:33,793 --> 00:13:44,793
Wide Forehead, Sexy Hips,
Dynamite Dimensions 34-24-35.

128
00:13:45,293 --> 00:13:46,293
Shtir Your Desire.

129
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:50,793
Tao, "Shtir"?
Is there such a word?

130
00:13:51,293 --> 00:13:54,293
Here we go again, mixing
and matching words.

131
00:13:57,293 --> 00:13:58,293
Who cares?

132
00:13:59,293 --> 00:14:01,793
Shtir Your Desire To Sizzles.

133
00:14:02,293 --> 00:14:05,793
But somehow they always catch on.

134
00:14:08,793 --> 00:14:11,793
Tag a few 'S's to the end of that.

135
00:14:12,293 --> 00:14:14,793
That's grammatically incorrect.

136
00:14:15,293 --> 00:14:19,293
Grammatically incorrect.

137
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:25,293
Then quadruple them, damn it.

138
00:14:25,793 --> 00:14:27,793
Where could she have gone?

139
00:14:51,293 --> 00:14:55,293
Now I have to paint
your nipples again!

140
00:14:59,793 --> 00:15:00,793
Not again.

141
00:15:01,793 --> 00:15:06,513
Make sure your fun doesn't
affect other's work.

142
00:15:07,293 --> 00:15:15,793
I was prepping her for the shoot.
Keeping them pert.

143
00:15:16,293 --> 00:15:18,293
Tao, come and meet Young Stallion.

144
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,793
This is Tao, my niece.

145
00:15:21,793 --> 00:15:25,793
This is Young Stallion.
Our hot new writer.

146
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,293
You two chat. I'll be back.

147
00:15:32,293 --> 00:15:37,793
Young Tao, Hia's favourite niece.

148
00:15:38,293 --> 00:15:41,293
Your reputation precedes you.

149
00:15:41,793 --> 00:15:44,793
I'm honoured by your presence.

150
00:15:45,793 --> 00:15:50,293
I guess I'm the only honoured
one here.

151
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:57,793
I've read your stories.

152
00:15:58,293 --> 00:16:03,293
They're just pussy perfect cute.
- Black ass baboon!

153
00:16:03,793 --> 00:16:04,977
Think you're shit hot?

154
00:16:05,793 --> 00:16:08,793
You've met your match.

155
00:16:11,793 --> 00:16:13,293
That was a compliment.

156
00:16:13,793 --> 00:16:17,293
Just holler if you need any help.
I'm always open.

157
00:16:31,762 --> 00:16:35,262
You're almost done with
school aren't you?

158
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:42,762
Your Aunt will kill me
if you flunk because...

159
00:16:43,262 --> 00:16:47,762
...you've been writing porn for me.

160
00:16:48,262 --> 00:16:53,262
She won't find out now.
I've been writing for years.

161
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:57,262
If I stop now I'll be broke.

162
00:16:57,762 --> 00:17:01,262
Don't you worry about my degree.

163
00:17:02,762 --> 00:17:04,262
I'll pass for sure.

164
00:17:05,762 --> 00:17:06,262
This won't pass.

165
00:17:06,762 --> 00:17:12,262
Categorizing romance doesn't
prove anything.

166
00:17:12,762 --> 00:17:19,262
If your work doesn't improve
you won't graduate.

167
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:42,791
What's up? Why the long face?

168
00:17:42,826 --> 00:17:43,762
Life sucks.

169
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:49,262
Here's something to cheer you up.

170
00:17:49,762 --> 00:17:54,262
The last one was hotter.

171
00:17:54,762 --> 00:17:57,762
No. Saengrawi was the hottest.

172
00:17:58,262 --> 00:18:02,762
Do you remember that
accident 2 years ago?

173
00:18:03,762 --> 00:18:08,262
You guys are useless.
Tits this, ass that.

174
00:18:08,762 --> 00:18:18,262
Women are gentle,
beautiful and pure.

175
00:18:18,762 --> 00:18:22,262
Act like gentlemen, women like that.

176
00:18:23,762 --> 00:18:26,262
As if you're such a man.

177
00:18:26,762 --> 00:18:28,762
Mui, how's it going?

178
00:18:43,762 --> 00:18:45,262
Shove over.

179
00:18:51,262 --> 00:18:54,762
What's wrong? Stressed out?

180
00:18:55,762 --> 00:18:57,262
Here, I'll give you a back rub.

181
00:19:00,762 --> 00:19:05,262
The report I have due
is so difficult.

182
00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:07,762
I don't really understand it.

183
00:19:09,641 --> 00:19:14,762
Why didn't you tell me?
I'll write it for you.

184
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:19,262
Hey, isn't that the guy
who sent flowers to Mui?

185
00:19:19,762 --> 00:19:20,262
Where?

186
00:19:20,762 --> 00:19:24,262
- Over there.
Looks like a monkey.

187
00:19:25,262 --> 00:19:31,262
He doesn't stand a chance.
Right, Mui?

188
00:19:51,762 --> 00:19:54,262
I don't have any change.
Come get it inside.

189
00:19:54,762 --> 00:19:57,262
Does she live alone?

190
00:19:58,262 --> 00:20:02,762
Her husband works in another
province. He's rarely here.

191
00:20:11,725 --> 00:20:14,280
Phan. Help me out. I'm lonely.

192
00:20:14,315 --> 00:20:16,762
Who would've thought
a motorcycle driver like me...

193
00:20:17,262 --> 00:20:19,762
would lay an oyster this rich.

194
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:25,762
She rapidly ripped off our clothes.

195
00:20:26,762 --> 00:20:29,262
And swallowed me whole like
a sex starved bitch.

196
00:20:37,762 --> 00:20:41,262
Have some sausage.
Your Aunt gave me too much.

197
00:20:45,262 --> 00:20:46,762
Tao, Hia's here.

198
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:56,361
What the hell! Even your hankie's
a monk's saffron.

199
00:21:04,762 --> 00:21:08,262
Hi, everyone. Food smells good.

200
00:21:09,262 --> 00:21:13,262
Aad came from Lampang
and brought these for you.

201
00:21:13,762 --> 00:21:22,262
Is Tao any use at your
amulet magazine?

202
00:21:26,262 --> 00:21:31,762
She's a hard-working girl.
Don't you worry.

203
00:21:33,762 --> 00:21:37,262
I've got to run, though.
Business calls.

204
00:21:50,762 --> 00:21:54,762
Tao, take Uncle Wang his food
and two packs of water.

205
00:21:55,762 --> 00:21:58,762
Jon, give me a hand so
I can make one trip.

206
00:22:00,262 --> 00:22:00,762
Okay.

207
00:22:03,262 --> 00:22:04,762
Uncle Wang's on the fifth floor,
right?

208
00:22:05,262 --> 00:22:07,762
Who says? He's on the 6th.
So forgetful.

209
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:11,262
He lives next to that room, Tao.

210
00:22:11,762 --> 00:22:15,262
Oh...that room.

211
00:22:24,762 --> 00:22:25,762
Here's your ice.

212
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:34,262
What's wrong? Is it your thesis?

213
00:22:35,262 --> 00:22:41,762
I'm sick of work. I can't keep up.
And I still have to deliver food.

214
00:22:42,262 --> 00:22:46,262
I know what you mean.
I feel pressed for time, too.

215
00:22:46,762 --> 00:22:53,762
You? Pressed for time?
Don't make me laugh.

216
00:22:54,262 --> 00:22:55,262
Is the water heavy?

217
00:22:55,297 --> 00:22:59,762
No sweat. When I was a monk
I had it harder.

218
00:23:04,262 --> 00:23:06,262
Uncle Wang. Your food's here.

219
00:23:13,262 --> 00:23:16,262
Tao, come in.

220
00:23:20,262 --> 00:23:20,762
Just put it on the table.

221
00:23:28,262 --> 00:23:37,262
Jon, perfect timing. Tell me what
this Buddhist term means.

222
00:23:37,762 --> 00:23:42,762
The sweltering heat hasn't deterred
the thousands of protestors...

223
00:23:43,262 --> 00:23:46,262
from crowding the streets from
Parliament to the Royal Grounds.

224
00:23:46,762 --> 00:23:49,262
But it means the kids no longer
have a place to fly their kites.

225
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:57,262
Day Six and Chalard Vorachard's
hunger strike is ongoing.

226
00:23:57,762 --> 00:23:59,262
You sure learnt a thing
or two as a monk.

227
00:23:59,762 --> 00:24:10,262
Talk, schmalk. I'm yawning.
Pay me first. 75 Baht.

228
00:24:20,262 --> 00:24:26,762
Tao, can you see
if there are any vacancies?

229
00:24:27,762 --> 00:24:29,762
Why? You gonna move?

230
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:34,262
I can't stand the racket from next
door anymore.

231
00:24:34,762 --> 00:24:41,262
They're at it all night.
I can't finish my mantras.

232
00:24:42,262 --> 00:24:44,762
C'mon. I know you like it.

233
00:24:47,262 --> 00:24:51,762
I just want to live in peace.

234
00:24:52,762 --> 00:24:55,762
Fine. I'll check for you.

235
00:25:00,762 --> 00:25:03,762
Do his neighbours drink all night?

236
00:25:04,762 --> 00:25:07,762
You're better off not knowing.

237
00:25:08,762 --> 00:25:09,762
Why?

238
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,762
Who lives there?

239
00:25:18,262 --> 00:25:18,762
I don't know.

240
00:25:24,262 --> 00:25:26,262
What a hottie!

241
00:25:26,762 --> 00:25:27,762
That's your type?

242
00:25:28,262 --> 00:25:33,947
Not bad.
You know a hottie like her?

243
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,165
I've never seen her before.

244
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,762
Her name is Koi. She's my neighbour.
Pong's sister-in-law.

245
00:25:41,262 --> 00:25:42,762
She's still in school.

246
00:25:43,262 --> 00:25:46,762
But I feel sorry for him.
He's been jobless for months.

247
00:25:47,262 --> 00:25:52,762
His wife has to support him.

248
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:55,762
Not graphic enough.

249
00:25:56,262 --> 00:26:00,762
You're a fool.
This isn't a fairy tale.

250
00:27:29,262 --> 00:27:33,762
You're about to be wed
and you don't have a clue.

251
00:27:55,762 --> 00:27:58,262
That night, I came back to my room.

252
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:01,762
I heard someone bathing.

253
00:28:03,762 --> 00:28:09,262
If it was my wife
we could get down and dirty.

254
00:28:15,262 --> 00:28:20,762
But then I heard another sound.

255
00:28:21,762 --> 00:28:25,262
Like someone eating spicy food.

256
00:28:26,762 --> 00:28:33,762
I knew then it wasn't my wife
but her sister, Koi.

257
00:28:37,762 --> 00:28:42,262
Suddenly I noticed light flitting
through a small hole.

258
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,762
So I took a peek.

259
00:28:47,762 --> 00:28:53,762
What appeared before my eyes
was Koi's white and voluptuous body.

260
00:28:54,262 --> 00:28:59,262
Koi, who disdains me for being
jobless and classless,

261
00:28:59,762 --> 00:29:03,762
...leading her sister
through hardship.

262
00:29:04,262 --> 00:29:10,762
Her naked curves caused my staff of
fire to rise and burn the door down.

263
00:29:46,762 --> 00:29:48,762
Slave of My Desire
by Tao Dindaeng

264
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:07,262
You're a genius.
You finished it so quick.

265
00:30:07,762 --> 00:30:11,262
Piece of cake.

266
00:30:11,762 --> 00:30:16,262
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

267
00:30:17,762 --> 00:30:22,262
No sweat.
There's no problem I can't solve.

268
00:30:22,762 --> 00:30:27,262
It's still not there.
You don't get it.

269
00:30:28,262 --> 00:30:30,262
Tell me something.
Have you ever?

270
00:30:33,262 --> 00:30:33,762
Come in.

271
00:30:36,262 --> 00:30:37,262
We're all here.

272
00:30:38,262 --> 00:30:42,262
Let's start the meeting then.

273
00:30:52,762 --> 00:30:55,762
I have something to show you.

274
00:30:58,762 --> 00:30:59,262
Here.

275
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:07,262
Is this really her?

276
00:31:07,762 --> 00:31:09,262
Of course.
Straight from acting to porn.

277
00:31:12,762 --> 00:31:15,762
It is her. Wow!

278
00:31:16,262 --> 00:31:18,262
These photos suck.

279
00:31:18,762 --> 00:31:23,262
Who's gonna cast
her in movies now?

280
00:31:23,762 --> 00:31:26,762
You want me to take
photos like this?

281
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:31,262
I can't afford anything this glossy.

282
00:31:32,762 --> 00:31:35,262
But who can afford the cover price?

283
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:42,762
Everyone, I guess.
They're all sold out.

284
00:31:43,262 --> 00:31:48,762
I had to fight for the last issue.

285
00:31:49,262 --> 00:31:50,762
Now, take a look at these.

286
00:31:53,762 --> 00:31:55,762
We're in dire straights gentlemen.

287
00:31:56,262 --> 00:32:01,762
The new cop won't take a bribe.

288
00:32:04,762 --> 00:32:08,262
Crummy mags like these are
flooding our market.

289
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:14,762
Nevertheless,
we must maintain our standards...

290
00:32:15,262 --> 00:32:17,762
...and not stoop to their level.

291
00:32:18,262 --> 00:32:23,262
And yet,
we can't afford to spend more.

292
00:32:23,762 --> 00:32:31,762
We must find a new way to sate
our readers' desires.

293
00:32:32,262 --> 00:32:35,262
We've got to spice things up
with some new columns.

294
00:32:35,762 --> 00:32:37,762
Any suggestions?

295
00:32:38,762 --> 00:32:43,262
How about a gay experience column?

296
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:45,762
I can write that, Hia.

297
00:32:46,262 --> 00:32:49,762
I can't stomach it.

298
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:54,762
Let's stick to normal human
behaviour. Any other ideas?

299
00:32:55,262 --> 00:33:02,762
Why don't we sell these?
I shaped it myself.

300
00:33:03,262 --> 00:33:04,262
What the hell is it?

301
00:33:04,297 --> 00:33:05,762
It's called The Void, sir.

302
00:33:12,262 --> 00:33:13,262
Seems risky.

303
00:33:15,262 --> 00:33:19,762
Let's concentrate on our
columns first? Anyone else?

304
00:33:20,762 --> 00:33:26,262
How about publishing amateur nudes.
Here are some samples.

305
00:33:27,762 --> 00:33:31,762
We've got a big following
among housewives.

306
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:35,262
Let them strut their stuff.

307
00:33:39,762 --> 00:33:49,262
Not too shabby. Good idea.

308
00:33:49,762 --> 00:33:53,262
It provides release for
both genders...

309
00:33:53,762 --> 00:33:56,762
and fits perfectly with
our magazines concept.

310
00:34:00,762 --> 00:34:04,762
Are we going to cut Dr. Porn's
Sex Advice Column?

311
00:34:05,262 --> 00:34:10,762
No way. It stays, no matter what.

312
00:34:11,262 --> 00:34:13,762
It serves a social role.

313
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:23,762
Don't forget our magazine maintains
the fabric of Thai society.

314
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:28,262
Don't follow fads blindly
and forget our roots.

315
00:34:29,262 --> 00:34:37,262
Now get back to work and remember.
Sayew serves Thai people's pleasure.

316
00:34:38,262 --> 00:34:42,262
For Thai people's pleasure.

317
00:34:44,762 --> 00:34:51,262
Now you see the problems we face.

318
00:34:51,762 --> 00:34:55,762
You have one more chance.

319
00:34:56,262 --> 00:35:00,262
But if you fail, that's it.

320
00:35:07,762 --> 00:35:12,762
I'm telling you, this tape's
shit hot. A sexpert like me was amazed.

321
00:35:14,262 --> 00:35:16,762
As for neophytes,
this will blow their mind.

322
00:35:16,797 --> 00:35:19,162
There was the wheelbarrow
and arching doe.

323
00:35:29,262 --> 00:35:32,262
Dr. Porn's Sex Advice.

324
00:35:45,762 --> 00:35:49,762
Dr. Porn. I'm a big fan
of your column.

325
00:35:50,262 --> 00:35:53,262
That's why I need your advice.

326
00:35:54,262 --> 00:35:59,762
I've got a big crush on this girl.
Her name is Toy.

327
00:36:00,762 --> 00:36:07,762
I'm serious about her,
but I'm afraid of rejection.

328
00:36:10,262 --> 00:36:11,262
I'm very shy.

329
00:36:13,762 --> 00:36:18,762
My question is this. Is there
a drug I can use to arouse her?

330
00:36:19,262 --> 00:36:20,662
How much will it cost?

331
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:25,762
If we had sex, then
I'm sure she'd be mine.

332
00:36:26,762 --> 00:36:29,762
Can you solve my problem?

333
00:36:33,762 --> 00:36:39,762
Problems I can solve,
but rape I won't condone.

334
00:36:40,762 --> 00:36:45,262
Drugs won't make her love you.

335
00:36:45,762 --> 00:36:51,262
The best thing is to woo her.

336
00:36:51,762 --> 00:36:56,762
Women love gentlemen.

337
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:09,762
My measurements are 40-23-38.
I'm 172 cm. tall...

338
00:37:10,262 --> 00:37:13,262
...and weigh 46 kg.
I'm also fair-skinned.

339
00:37:13,762 --> 00:37:16,762
I'm comfortable with my body.

340
00:37:17,762 --> 00:37:27,262
Everyone stares as I walk by,
which is proof of my beauty.

341
00:37:27,762 --> 00:37:31,762
What should I do to become
a nude model?

342
00:37:34,762 --> 00:37:36,762
Your measurements are stupendous.

343
00:37:37,262 --> 00:37:39,262
I'm only a 37.

344
00:37:39,762 --> 00:37:44,762
Send me shots that flaunt
your face and figure.

345
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:49,762
A swimsuit shot would be great
as the editor is keen on you.

346
00:37:51,262 --> 00:37:52,762
You'll be the next cover girl.

347
00:37:53,762 --> 00:37:55,262
Dear Dr. Porn.

348
00:37:55,762 --> 00:38:01,762
Can a girl get pregnant if she has
sex 1 to 7 days after her period?

349
00:38:03,262 --> 00:38:07,762
And if she was on the rag?
What then?

350
00:38:13,762 --> 00:38:18,262
What if I wore a condom?
Is there a risk then?

351
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:29,262
Please tell me all the risks.

352
00:38:31,262 --> 00:38:36,762
Sex during her period isn't risky
but might be bad for the girl.

353
00:38:42,762 --> 00:38:46,262
And if the condom didn't
break, your risk is low.

354
00:38:46,762 --> 00:38:49,762
But are you sure you slipped
it on right?

355
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:52,262
Dear Dr. Porn.

356
00:38:53,262 --> 00:38:59,262
I'm a single woman. My problem is...

357
00:39:00,262 --> 00:39:05,262
One of my co-workers keeps
flirting with me.

358
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:08,262
He's very sweet.

359
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,763
love love love love love love love

360
00:39:11,798 --> 00:39:15,262
He says he loves me even
though he's married.

361
00:39:29,262 --> 00:39:36,762
Late at night, when we're alone,
he tries to feel me up.

362
00:39:38,262 --> 00:39:40,262
Sometimes I get aroused.

363
00:39:40,762 --> 00:39:43,262
I'm afraid I'll give in one day.

364
00:39:44,262 --> 00:39:51,262
I never wanted to be a mistress.
What should I do?

365
00:39:58,762 --> 00:40:02,762
Girls never win by messing
with married men.

366
00:40:03,262 --> 00:40:07,762
And these men are horny bastards,
unsatisfied with one woman.

367
00:40:08,762 --> 00:40:11,262
I'd steer clear of trouble.

368
00:40:11,762 --> 00:40:17,762
There are so many other men
out there for you.

369
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:33,361
Dear Dr. Porn. I'm in love with
a certain woman.

370
00:40:33,915 --> 00:40:42,762
But I'm only a salesman so
I don't dare approach her.

371
00:40:45,762 --> 00:40:49,762
Right now,
my heart's about to burst.

372
00:40:51,987 --> 00:40:55,262
She gives sex advice.
Her initials are P.

373
00:40:55,762 --> 00:40:58,262
I've followed her column
from the start.

374
00:41:00,081 --> 00:41:02,262
As time passes, my passion grows.

375
00:41:02,762 --> 00:41:08,262
Judging from her writing,
she must be sexy.

376
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,762
I'd like to be with her.

377
00:41:13,759 --> 00:41:18,262
Do you think I stand a chance,
sexy Doctor?

378
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:24,262
I'll patiently await your answer.
Love, Anonymous.

379
00:41:49,889 --> 00:41:51,062
Dear Anonymous.

380
00:41:51,562 --> 00:42:02,062
Your sexing...oops,
vexing problem.

381
00:42:06,043 --> 00:42:09,062
Uncle Porn. Do you ever get lonely?

382
00:42:09,562 --> 00:42:16,562
Where would I find the time
with all my work?

383
00:42:19,754 --> 00:42:22,062
Have you ever had writer's block?

384
00:42:25,905 --> 00:42:27,562
Having trouble writing, are we?

385
00:42:30,062 --> 00:42:37,562
Our job is to fuel
people's fantasies.

386
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:42,562
But sometimes...

387
00:42:43,062 --> 00:42:47,062
We must fantasize ourselves.
- Doctor's licence revoked...

388
00:42:47,562 --> 00:42:53,062
by Medical Board.
- Like my sexy doctor persona.

389
00:43:02,441 --> 00:43:08,062
Must we have experienced
what we fantasize about?

390
00:43:11,274 --> 00:43:13,062
Be patient.

391
00:43:14,368 --> 00:43:20,062
Experience takes time
and shouldn't be rushed.

392
00:43:21,562 --> 00:43:27,562
Tell me, have you ever read
our magazine?

393
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,562
Give it a read. How can you write
without understanding...

394
00:43:38,062 --> 00:43:41,062
...who it's for and what it's about?

395
00:43:41,562 --> 00:43:48,562
And remember,
we create ready-made experiences.

396
00:43:50,899 --> 00:43:52,362
Ready-made experiences?

397
00:43:52,397 --> 00:43:53,062
That's right.

398
00:43:53,562 --> 00:44:01,062
All types of pornography
are ready-made experiences.

399
00:44:03,062 --> 00:44:07,562
Masturbation.

400
00:44:21,562 --> 00:44:23,062
I'd like one ticket.

401
00:44:24,562 --> 00:44:25,562
25 Baht.

402
00:44:46,222 --> 00:44:47,562
Let's get a room.

403
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:54,062
Okay.

404
00:45:19,035 --> 00:45:20,555
What the heck!

405
00:46:04,857 --> 00:46:08,368
What a rip-off! No tits and ass
and the scenes were swapped.

406
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:14,868
Who cares? No one's here to
watch the film.

407
00:46:25,361 --> 00:46:28,368
Just my luck.
Sticky floors and no tits.

408
00:46:34,368 --> 00:46:39,368
Come to watch a porno, have we?

409
00:46:39,868 --> 00:46:44,868
What? No! I came to buy noodles but
the store was closed.

410
00:46:45,368 --> 00:46:49,368
I'm only teasing.
Where're you headed?

411
00:46:49,868 --> 00:46:52,368
Home. What's it to you?

412
00:46:53,368 --> 00:46:59,868
Hia told me that we live close by.
Let me be your ride.

413
00:47:00,368 --> 00:47:03,368
I'm fine. I have feet.

414
00:47:04,368 --> 00:47:07,868
I guess you're scared to straddle
my bike!

415
00:47:08,368 --> 00:47:11,868
You wish. I just don't need a ride.

416
00:47:12,368 --> 00:47:19,868
Fine, have it your way.
I don't like to force people.

417
00:47:29,868 --> 00:47:37,368
Hold on. I've changed my mind.
I'm too lazy to wait for the bus.

418
00:47:37,868 --> 00:47:41,368
I knew you'd give in. Hop on.

419
00:47:48,868 --> 00:47:50,868
C'mon, just straddle it.

420
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:08,410
You drive like a maniac!

421
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:12,910
This is nothing! Grip me tight.

422
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:19,410
Can't you drive any slower?

423
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:25,599
Life in the slow lane
just ain't fun. You only live once.

424
00:48:25,821 --> 00:48:28,821
You might as well push the limits.

425
00:48:30,821 --> 00:48:32,821
Stop. You'll miss the turn.

426
00:48:37,321 --> 00:48:40,121
What do you think you're doing?
Try that again and I'll sock you one.

427
00:48:40,821 --> 00:48:42,821
Such soft breasts.

428
00:48:45,792 --> 00:48:50,421
Let go. I said let go.
Can't you hear me?

429
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:59,821
You take life too seriously.

430
00:49:18,759 --> 00:49:25,321
Go out and enjoy yourself.
Or time may find your heart cold.

431
00:49:27,321 --> 00:49:33,938
Beware your cold heart, vampire.
Toodle-loo!

432
00:49:38,532 --> 00:49:39,532
Wise ass!

433
00:49:40,067 --> 00:49:43,621
Protests against the military
dictator are heating up...

434
00:49:43,721 --> 00:49:48,421
with thousands more people
descending on the capital.

435
00:49:48,921 --> 00:49:51,821
Tao, give the manager my old key.

436
00:49:52,821 --> 00:49:55,321
Is your new room quieter?

437
00:49:55,821 --> 00:50:02,821
Much better. I can pray in peace.

438
00:50:03,821 --> 00:50:05,821
Around 1pm, a gunfight
broke out between police...

439
00:50:06,021 --> 00:50:07,321
...and a gang robbing a gold shop.

440
00:50:07,821 --> 00:50:11,321
And they can scream to
their heart's content.

441
00:50:16,321 --> 00:50:19,321
The police, led by Black Hand,
shot dead three thieves.

442
00:50:19,821 --> 00:50:22,321
Once again, Black Hand lays down
the law with his gun.

443
00:50:22,821 --> 00:50:25,821
Murder, schmurder!
Switch over to the soaps.

444
00:50:26,821 --> 00:50:32,321
Why? It's the news.

445
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:36,321
But there's never any good news.

446
00:50:36,821 --> 00:50:39,321
One bullet is all it takes!

447
00:50:39,821 --> 00:50:41,321
That's my hero.

448
00:51:29,637 --> 00:51:30,637
Hey!

449
00:51:30,638 --> 00:51:34,638
Are you mental?
That shirt's perfectly good.

450
00:51:37,423 --> 00:51:40,638
I hear it's all the rage.

451
00:51:42,138 --> 00:51:47,138
I see. You wanna be
kool and the gang, huh?

452
00:51:48,494 --> 00:51:49,638
Are you trying to impress a chick?

453
00:51:52,905 --> 00:51:56,638
Chicks don't dig dudes like you.

454
00:52:01,542 --> 00:52:05,138
I guess you're right.

455
00:52:09,589 --> 00:52:17,138
You're such a wimp.
One word and you cave in.

456
00:52:19,872 --> 00:52:24,638
But you're right. No one digs me.

457
00:52:27,507 --> 00:52:33,138
You're so lame.
Treat it as a challenge.

458
00:52:34,369 --> 00:52:37,638
If you need tips to hook a girl,
just ask me.

459
00:52:38,138 --> 00:52:41,638
To get a girl,
you've gotta give it your all.

460
00:55:36,518 --> 00:55:38,260
This hasn't improved.
You ignored my comments.

461
00:55:38,295 --> 00:55:41,549
You need to understand
how romances use language...

462
00:55:42,049 --> 00:55:47,049
...to manipulate
the reader's fantasies.

463
00:55:48,049 --> 00:55:50,374
Are you listening?

464
00:55:50,409 --> 00:55:52,166
Stick to your thesis...

465
00:55:52,569 --> 00:55:57,486
...the relationship between
Thai literature and Thai life.

466
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:03,049
If not, you won't pass
your thesis defence.

467
00:56:14,465 --> 00:56:18,049
The professor stroked my ripped
and ready body.

468
00:56:19,671 --> 00:56:27,003
She breathed in my ear:
"For this, I'll grant you an A".

469
00:56:38,557 --> 00:56:42,247
She peeled off
her nightingale wings...

470
00:56:43,256 --> 00:56:48,218
...and lay down on the table
allowing me to examine her.

471
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:57,445
If you perform OT
like this every night,

472
00:56:58,703 --> 00:57:02,190
...you'll definitely get your bonus.

473
00:57:03,979 --> 00:57:05,849
Aside from pork buns,

474
00:57:05,949 --> 00:57:09,949
...her hot buns were included
with the combo meal.

475
00:57:12,261 --> 00:57:16,549
She cleaned my entire body
from head to toe.

476
00:57:18,036 --> 00:57:22,274
She slapped cuffs on me and
handed me a hot sex ticket.

477
00:57:22,717 --> 00:57:26,549
She provided hot
after sales service straight...

478
00:57:27,049 --> 00:57:30,522
...to bed without
charging sales tax.

479
00:57:39,982 --> 00:57:47,049
Her cooking was spicy
but her sex was even spicier.

480
00:57:53,739 --> 00:57:59,549
What a loser! The original version
was much better.

481
00:58:00,979 --> 00:58:04,049
You hate every version
but watch them every night.

482
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,909
Aren't you sick of the plot?

483
00:58:09,049 --> 00:58:10,549
Who cares?

484
00:58:11,049 --> 00:58:20,549
When you're beat and broke,
anything's better than reality.

485
00:58:21,049 --> 00:58:25,549
This guy is all talk, no action.

486
00:58:26,049 --> 00:58:32,049
Why doesn't he just rape her
and get it over with?

487
00:58:34,042 --> 00:58:37,347
Are you endorsing immoral behaviour?

488
00:58:37,456 --> 00:58:41,843
Of course not.
We just shouldn't be inhibited.

489
00:58:41,878 --> 00:58:43,562
We should go out and
get what we want.

490
00:58:44,931 --> 00:58:45,949
Are you sure?

491
00:58:47,471 --> 00:58:48,978
Of course.

492
00:58:51,159 --> 00:58:54,349
Seems risky.

493
00:58:55,297 --> 00:58:59,850
There's a live show in there.
We'd be idiots to pass it up.

494
00:59:00,173 --> 00:59:01,596
Or are you chicken?

495
00:59:03,958 --> 00:59:05,382
It's not that.

496
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:09,512
I'll go myself then.

497
00:59:22,287 --> 00:59:27,107
Why don't I climb first?

498
00:59:44,369 --> 00:59:46,468
This room looks empty.

499
00:59:47,318 --> 00:59:51,087
It's not. They only come at night.

500
01:00:10,782 --> 01:00:12,273
There's nothing here.

501
01:00:22,715 --> 01:00:24,254
Look!

502
01:00:24,255 --> 01:00:25,721
Ssh! Quiet, Tao.

503
01:00:28,531 --> 01:00:29,849
A whole handful.

504
01:00:39,584 --> 01:00:40,796
What's this?

505
01:00:55,017 --> 01:00:56,249
It vibrates.

506
01:00:57,549 --> 01:01:00,871
I see. A foot massager.

507
01:01:07,456 --> 01:01:10,781
It feels good. Give it a try.

508
01:01:10,962 --> 01:01:12,337
I'll pass.

509
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:31,447
Where should we hide?

510
01:01:47,102 --> 01:01:48,407
I'm cramped.

511
01:01:51,281 --> 01:01:53,600
Give me some room.

512
01:01:53,654 --> 01:01:56,251
I can't. I'm against the wall.

513
01:02:36,977 --> 01:02:40,114
I'm bored. Where are they?

514
01:02:44,687 --> 01:02:48,122
It's 1 a.m. They're not coming.
Let's leave, Tao.

515
01:03:16,597 --> 01:03:18,380
Tao, they're here.

516
01:03:39,331 --> 01:03:41,331
You make me so hot.

517
01:03:52,165 --> 01:03:54,665
It's Black Hand.

518
01:04:14,522 --> 01:04:15,522
Honey.

519
01:04:18,505 --> 01:04:19,627
Honey.

520
01:04:22,063 --> 01:04:23,563
Like what you see?

521
01:04:26,931 --> 01:04:30,931
You can sniff me now. I'm all bare.

522
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:38,121
Catch me if you can. Hurry.
Catch me.

523
01:04:57,082 --> 01:04:58,121
I've got you now.

524
01:05:00,679 --> 01:05:02,179
Good boy.

525
01:05:10,621 --> 01:05:13,121
You can run but you can't hide.

526
01:05:13,621 --> 01:05:28,121
Come and get it.

527
01:05:45,621 --> 01:05:47,121
It just won't wake up.

528
01:05:48,121 --> 01:05:52,121
Don't get upset.
Let's try something else.

529
01:05:53,121 --> 01:06:01,621
Turn over. Here's your favourite toy.

530
01:06:18,121 --> 01:06:23,621
It's no use. Nothing can help.

531
01:06:26,121 --> 01:06:29,121
It's okay. Hush now.

532
01:06:29,621 --> 01:06:31,621
We've tried everything.

533
01:06:35,121 --> 01:06:38,621
All because of the bomb
in that damned war.

534
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,621
I've got nothing left.

535
01:06:46,621 --> 01:06:50,621
Be still, love.

536
01:06:51,621 --> 01:06:53,121
I'm the Black Hand. A hero.

537
01:06:53,621 --> 01:07:05,121
Where will I put my face?
My wife left me. I'm not a man.

538
01:07:06,121 --> 01:07:11,121
But you've still got me. Be still.

539
01:07:11,621 --> 01:07:16,621
We can just hold each other.

540
01:08:08,121 --> 01:08:12,621
Premature Ejaculation.

541
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:39,621
Hello. Who's this?

542
01:08:40,895 --> 01:08:44,621
Tao, is that you?

543
01:08:46,121 --> 01:08:47,121
What?

544
01:08:48,121 --> 01:08:49,121
The story's not finished?

545
01:08:50,121 --> 01:08:51,121
Which one?

546
01:08:54,621 --> 01:08:56,621
Don't worry, Tao.

547
01:08:57,121 --> 01:09:01,121
Take your time. Gotta go.

548
01:09:01,621 --> 01:09:10,121
No rush. Take your time. Bye.

549
01:09:36,621 --> 01:09:45,121
The position of the Prime Minister
to defend Buddhism from its enemies.

550
01:09:49,121 --> 01:09:52,621
By assembling data on
trends in Thai fiction,

551
01:09:53,121 --> 01:09:56,621
I found that 86% of romances
crossed class boundaries.

552
01:09:57,121 --> 01:10:02,121
50% of the time, the man is wealthy
and the woman is poor.

553
01:10:02,621 --> 01:10:03,121
Wikanda.

554
01:10:05,121 --> 01:10:11,121
Wikanda! What is the point
of all this data?

555
01:10:11,621 --> 01:10:16,121
That different authors have
different writing styles?

556
01:10:16,621 --> 01:10:20,621
- What connects all the numbers?
- What is their social role?

557
01:10:21,121 --> 01:10:25,621
Fuck. I'm dogged with bad luck.
I need a monk's blessings.

558
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:33,621
It'll work out. Remain calm
and you'll see clearly.

559
01:10:34,121 --> 01:10:39,121
What do you know?
My life's a mess right now.

560
01:10:40,121 --> 01:10:43,621
Like how?

561
01:10:44,621 --> 01:10:48,621
My thesis was scuppered.
I might not graduate.

562
01:10:49,621 --> 01:10:57,121
Deal with one thing at a time.
Fix it and move on to the next.

563
01:10:58,621 --> 01:11:03,121
The magazine I write for
might be shut down.

564
01:11:04,121 --> 01:11:09,121
Don't worry. I'm sure it'll survive.

565
01:11:09,621 --> 01:11:16,621
And my hero, Black Hand,
turned out to be a dud.

566
01:11:18,121 --> 01:11:21,721
Nonsense. I think it's great.
Even though his wife left him.

567
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:24,121
...he still has someone
who loves him.

568
01:11:24,621 --> 01:11:26,621
How romantic.

569
01:11:27,121 --> 01:11:31,621
Damn it! Why are you so upbeat?

570
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,621
Why didn't you stay a monk?

571
01:11:34,121 --> 01:11:36,121
Why'd you enrol in university?

572
01:11:54,921 --> 01:12:01,921
The Science Major gently places
his hand on her thigh...

573
01:12:02,421 --> 01:12:07,421
...and strokes her
to arousal.

574
01:12:07,921 --> 01:12:11,421
She unconsciously spreads
her legs wide.

575
01:12:11,921 --> 01:12:19,421
But she fails to see the steering
wheel turning into a short-time motel.

576
01:12:23,921 --> 01:12:27,421
The Science major, of honest face
but crooked heart,

577
01:12:28,421 --> 01:12:30,921
...tricks innocent Mui into
this dubious situation.

578
01:12:32,921 --> 01:12:39,921
I understand now. Men and women
are opposite poles.

579
01:13:05,421 --> 01:13:06,421
Mui!

580
01:13:07,921 --> 01:13:10,921
How did you find me?

581
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:16,421
The other day I saw
you in that guy's car.

582
01:13:16,921 --> 01:13:18,421
What were you up to?

583
01:13:19,921 --> 01:13:23,421
Nothing. We bumped into each
other so he invited me to dinner.

584
01:13:23,921 --> 01:13:26,921
After that he dropped me home.

585
01:13:29,421 --> 01:13:32,921
What did you think we did?

586
01:13:36,421 --> 01:13:41,421
I thought...I thought...

587
01:14:33,921 --> 01:14:37,921
Mui lay on the plush bed in
the motel room.

588
01:14:38,421 --> 01:14:44,421
Her clothes in disarray revealed
her soft, full breasts...

589
01:14:44,921 --> 01:14:54,421
increasing my desire to strip her
naked and revel in her taut flesh.

590
01:14:54,921 --> 01:14:57,421
What are you doing? Stop it.

591
01:14:58,421 --> 01:15:01,421
Don't be scared.
This is your first time, right?

592
01:15:03,421 --> 01:15:04,921
I'll make it special.

593
01:15:05,421 --> 01:15:07,421
I'm scared.

594
01:15:07,921 --> 01:15:12,921
Don't be.
Try it once and you'll love it.

595
01:15:16,421 --> 01:15:18,921
You're jealous, aren't you?

596
01:15:46,921 --> 01:15:48,421
What's wrong?

597
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:53,421
How come it's so soft and slimy?

598
01:16:12,421 --> 01:16:15,186
That wasn't so hot!

599
01:16:19,921 --> 01:16:23,921
Damn, maybe I'm not.

600
01:16:29,921 --> 01:16:33,921
Dyke Gets Dicked
by Young Stallion

601
01:16:51,421 --> 01:16:57,921
And a tomboy like Oh got
her first dose of cock.

602
01:18:50,683 --> 01:18:52,683
Who's the owner?

603
01:18:55,641 --> 01:18:57,683
Not me.

604
01:18:59,183 --> 01:19:00,183
Then who?

605
01:19:01,683 --> 01:19:04,683
He's abroad.

606
01:19:06,172 --> 01:19:07,383
What's this?

607
01:19:07,683 --> 01:19:11,683
Shots of my wife I took for fun.

608
01:19:12,183 --> 01:19:15,183
The Armed Forces Supreme
Command released...

609
01:19:15,683 --> 01:19:19,512
...the National Peace-Keeping
Council's Mandate...

610
01:19:20,350 --> 01:19:24,183
...forbidding citizens from joining
the political protests...

611
01:19:25,612 --> 01:19:29,639
...and disturbing public peace.

612
01:20:06,069 --> 01:20:07,283
Hia's been arrested.

613
01:20:18,083 --> 01:20:19,083
You can't all see him at once.

614
01:20:36,467 --> 01:20:39,467
What's wrong? He's right there.

615
01:20:39,583 --> 01:20:41,583
But this is...

616
01:20:42,583 --> 01:20:46,583
Hia Kung Fu, how are you?
We'll get you out.

617
01:20:47,583 --> 01:20:49,583
Hia's gone into hiding.

618
01:21:11,083 --> 01:21:17,083
Greetings, gentlemen.
I apologize for running off.

619
01:21:17,583 --> 01:21:20,937
But this time the cops
mean business.

620
01:21:20,972 --> 01:21:24,239
At least I've arranged a fall guy.

621
01:21:24,274 --> 01:21:29,583
I've taken a beating with
the last few issues.

622
01:21:30,083 --> 01:21:36,083
Sometimes ideals go against market
forces and even the law.

623
01:21:37,083 --> 01:21:40,083
It pains me to quit publishing
Sayew, even though...

624
01:21:40,583 --> 01:21:44,583
...it's just print on paper.

625
01:21:45,083 --> 01:21:58,083
I know we're all proud of it and
the joy it provides our readers.

626
01:21:58,583 --> 01:22:02,583
Though the magazine is shut down,
I'll return.

627
01:22:03,083 --> 01:22:05,583
May everyone go his or
her separate way for now.

628
01:22:06,083 --> 01:22:08,544
Vaya con dios.

629
01:22:13,677 --> 01:22:14,883
Is this really it?

630
01:22:15,083 --> 01:22:23,047
Every party has its end.
It's time to face reality. Right?

631
01:22:27,158 --> 01:22:29,583
Does everyone have
somewhere to go?

632
01:22:30,749 --> 01:22:35,267
I'm sticking to porn.
Cherry Poppin' needs a writer.

633
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:41,083
Are you sure?

634
01:22:43,379 --> 01:22:49,583
It's wilder than Animal Planet.
That's a bad idea.

635
01:22:50,514 --> 01:22:53,083
It's challenging and exciting to me.

636
01:22:53,583 --> 01:22:58,083
When will you settle down?
You should plan your future.

637
01:22:59,286 --> 01:23:05,081
Life without plans.
This is my future.

638
01:23:05,890 --> 01:23:09,083
It's your life. Let's split up then.

639
01:23:16,946 --> 01:23:20,083
What should I do?

640
01:23:21,083 --> 01:23:28,583
You should study
so you can graduate.

641
01:24:41,983 --> 01:24:43,983
Your thesis won't write itself.

642
01:24:48,983 --> 01:24:50,983
Haven't you been helping
at Hia's magazine lately?

643
01:24:57,483 --> 01:24:59,483
You need to work harder.

644
01:25:01,483 --> 01:25:08,983
Look at Hia. He started with nothing
and now he's well to do.

645
01:25:11,983 --> 01:25:18,983
Or Jon. He's an orphan
but he's worked hard...

646
01:25:19,483 --> 01:25:23,983
...for his scholarship.
He'll go far.

647
01:25:27,483 --> 01:25:30,983
You should finish school
and lead a normal life.

648
01:25:31,483 --> 01:25:35,483
Get married and teach.

649
01:25:39,483 --> 01:25:41,483
Does it have to be that way?

650
01:25:42,983 --> 01:25:44,983
What if I don't want to be
a teacher?

651
01:25:46,983 --> 01:25:51,983
If you don't become a teacher,
what will you be?

652
01:25:51,984 --> 01:25:56,983
Losing It.

653
01:26:01,055 --> 01:26:02,055
Where are you going?

654
01:26:02,130 --> 01:26:03,683
Dropping off work for Hia.

655
01:26:05,881 --> 01:26:07,972
I thought Sayew was busted?

656
01:26:12,078 --> 01:26:13,816
You heard about that?

657
01:26:15,289 --> 01:26:16,819
Going to see that grease ball?

658
01:26:20,214 --> 01:26:21,983
I'll go with you.

659
01:26:22,577 --> 01:26:23,873
What for?

660
01:26:23,983 --> 01:26:26,483
He seems dangerous.

661
01:26:26,984 --> 01:26:30,983
Danger's good.
It makes life pulsate.

662
01:26:31,983 --> 01:26:35,483
Are you bored?
Just enjoy things as they are.

663
01:26:35,983 --> 01:26:41,483
I'm not like you.
I can't stand being boring like you!

664
01:27:05,183 --> 01:27:07,683
What are you doing here?

665
01:27:08,183 --> 01:27:09,683
Returning the porno.

666
01:27:11,683 --> 01:27:14,683
Come in a sec.

667
01:27:17,683 --> 01:27:21,683
I'd be a rude host if my guests
stayed in the hallway.

668
01:27:22,183 --> 01:27:23,683
Or are you scared?

669
01:27:24,183 --> 01:27:25,483
I'm not scared.

670
01:27:33,683 --> 01:27:34,983
A cup of coffee?

671
01:28:06,183 --> 01:28:12,683
Be back in a jiff. I'm out of cream.

672
01:28:52,714 --> 01:29:01,714
"The Young Girl On Fire"
Innocent Joy hesitantly crossed...

673
01:29:06,714 --> 01:29:12,214
FAMOUS DOCTOR DRUGS
PATIENTS FOR SEX

674
01:29:13,714 --> 01:29:15,714
LOPPED OFF PENIS

675
01:29:17,714 --> 01:29:20,714
MOTEL BROTHEL RAID
FINDS 11 YEAR OLD

676
01:30:17,628 --> 01:30:18,714
Do you take sugar?

677
01:30:19,714 --> 01:30:21,214
Two spoons. Two.

678
01:30:40,214 --> 01:30:50,714
Innocent Joy hesitantly crossed
the point of no return.

679
01:30:51,214 --> 01:31:00,714
He stirs the tasteless sex potion
into her cold orange juice.

680
01:31:01,214 --> 01:31:04,214
She takes a big gulp knowing...

681
01:31:04,714 --> 01:31:11,714
...it will plunge her into a dark
world she's never experienced.

682
01:31:12,214 --> 01:31:19,420
Her vision begins to cloud.
The world becomes fuzzy.

683
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:31,714
She loses motor control.
Her surroundings begin to spin.

684
01:31:32,214 --> 01:31:34,714
Her head throbs.

685
01:31:34,749 --> 01:31:38,714
Her heavy lids slowly roll down
over her eyes.

686
01:31:39,214 --> 01:31:46,385
She sinks into a deep darkness.

687
01:31:48,414 --> 01:31:49,914
When Joy regains consciousness,

688
01:31:50,415 --> 01:31:55,415
...she finds herself lying
in a strange room.

689
01:31:56,268 --> 01:32:01,393
The walls are a deep red.
The lights are dim.

690
01:32:01,428 --> 01:32:03,768
There's a mirror on the ceiling.

691
01:32:05,768 --> 01:32:10,768
As her eyes adjust, she sees
her reflection in the mirror.

692
01:32:11,768 --> 01:32:17,268
She's wearing an S&M suit.
She's scared to death!

693
01:32:23,825 --> 01:32:29,083
Here's some steaming hot coffee.
Sorry for the wait.

694
01:32:33,449 --> 01:32:35,268
Can I work at Cherry Poppin' too?

695
01:32:38,599 --> 01:32:47,268
I don't think so. Failing to finish
a porno doesn't qualify.

696
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:50,768
This is the real deal, baby.

697
01:35:47,919 --> 01:35:48,893
Stop.

698
01:36:36,251 --> 01:36:43,251
My life isn't for you. You have
another life waiting for you.

699
01:37:46,824 --> 01:37:53,324
My name is Tao. I'm a country girl
but I moved to Bangkok...

700
01:37:54,175 --> 01:38:00,175
...where I live with my Aunt.
I'm twenty years old.

701
01:38:00,878 --> 01:38:11,378
I'm just an ordinary girl who enjoys
making up stories...

702
01:38:11,913 --> 01:38:15,277
...to spice up all our boring lives.

703
01:39:08,518 --> 01:39:12,518
I've never accepted a mundane life.

704
01:39:13,518 --> 01:39:19,518
...the reality of an uneventful
life as a woman.

705
01:39:27,018 --> 01:39:34,636
Www...

706
01:39:44,518 --> 01:39:50,002
One day, a certain man
made me realize...

707
01:39:50,871 --> 01:39:56,518
...that the mundane holds
a loving warmth.

708
01:40:05,518 --> 01:40:06,018
Jon.

709
01:40:10,230 --> 01:40:14,018
But that realization may
have come too late.

710
01:42:49,243 --> 01:42:54,306
His loving gaze made
my heart beat fast.

711
01:42:55,806 --> 01:43:00,306
I could sense his
true feelings...

712
01:43:01,806 --> 01:43:05,306
...the care he's always
lavished upon me.

713
01:43:20,306 --> 01:43:23,306
Tao, why are you sitting in the dark?

714
01:43:36,806 --> 01:43:41,306
I'm bored. Let's watch the soaps?

715
01:43:48,451 --> 01:43:50,951
Damn. It's over.

716
01:44:29,806 --> 01:44:31,806
In the refreshing rain,

717
01:44:33,056 --> 01:44:46,291
...we enjoyed a long and deep kiss
and swore never to part.

718
01:44:47,045 --> 01:44:50,545
The End

719
01:45:02,806 --> 01:45:07,306
Day Dreams

720
01:45:16,806 --> 01:45:20,513
That night I found my true self.

721
01:45:21,583 --> 01:45:28,246
I wrote a novel and that novel
changed my life.

722
01:45:30,364 --> 01:45:35,186
I became a best-selling
romance novelist.

723
01:45:51,358 --> 01:45:52,936
Hia Kung Fu is back.

724
01:45:52,971 --> 01:46:00,340
After going into hiding, who
would've thought that "The Void",

725
01:46:00,375 --> 01:46:05,442
...would make him rich enough
to return.

726
01:46:05,477 --> 01:46:07,806
He met Pol Sopong,
a talented nude photographer.

727
01:46:08,306 --> 01:46:10,410
They enjoyed a glorious comeback
as NIGHT-TRIP.

728
01:46:12,178 --> 01:46:17,781
Hia expanded into a publishing group
that publishes my books as well.

729
01:46:17,816 --> 01:46:21,493
He maintains the same old ideals.

730
01:46:21,528 --> 01:46:27,528
But he's adapted them to
his readers' changing tastes.

731
01:46:27,563 --> 01:46:47,129
Hey, Tao. I sold the movie rights for
your book, "True Love".

732
01:46:47,164 --> 01:46:51,164
He even has plans to host
a website "motel69.net"...

733
01:46:52,474 --> 01:46:55,435
...to meet his readers' needs.

734
01:46:55,970 --> 01:46:59,820
Sex has become a social norm.

735
01:46:59,855 --> 01:47:02,566
But sexual confusion still remains.

736
01:47:03,101 --> 01:47:09,601
For some, like myself,
it's a passing phase.

737
01:47:09,964 --> 01:47:13,964
But for others,
it's a life-long commitment.

738
01:47:14,921 --> 01:47:16,921
Next month, we're getting married.

739
01:47:36,442 --> 01:47:42,475
And some people still quest for
ever more exciting lives.

740
01:48:04,533 --> 01:48:08,007
As for myself,
I discovered excitement...

741
01:48:08,042 --> 01:48:13,449
...and adventure in everyday life.

742
01:48:13,484 --> 01:48:22,930
But there are still times when I get
bored and dream of running away.

743
01:48:35,997 --> 01:48:36,997
SEXY

744
01:48:39,497 --> 01:48:40,997
SASSY

745
01:48:46,497 --> 01:48:48,997
DARARAI SUPERSPY

746
01:48:55,742 --> 01:49:00,806
Sometimes I forget how lucky I am.
I have a job...

747
01:49:01,807 --> 01:49:09,307
...that I love and which pays me to dream.
And a loving family to boot.

748
01:49:17,973 --> 01:49:20,973
The End

749
01:49:22,777 --> 01:49:27,777
So picture perfect.
Could it all be a dream?
