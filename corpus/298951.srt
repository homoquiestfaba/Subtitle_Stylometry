1
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,240
Coffee, Susan, please.

2
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,640
With vanilla.

3
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,600
Good day, Mrs. Mirabeau.

4
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,920
Ernie.
Carolina.

5
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,320
And of course, good day

6
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,120
to the fairy princess herself,
Miss Georgia.

7
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,960
So how's married life
treating you this week, Ernie?

8
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,840
Fine.

9
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,080
Fine, fine.

10
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,800
It's another book.
You know me,

11
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,840
I didn't go through the 8th grade.
My grandbaby here reads Anna Karena.

12
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,560
Anna Karenina. She jumped in front
of a train when her boyfriend left.

13
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,600
Yeah, well grandma's gotta pee.

14
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,840
I want coffee, please.

15
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,960
No, you're too little.

16
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,320
You have coffee.

17
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,360
Thank you, that'll be all Susan.

18
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,720
You know what, you're not a fairy
princess. You're a fairy bitch.

19
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,120
Yeah, you're an ugly smart bitch.
No one will ever marry you.

20
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,600
I hate you!

21
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,960
I hate you even more!
Look at my shoes!

22
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,840
So what do I care?

23
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,760
You did that on purpose!
No I didn't!

24
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,960
Yes you did!
No!

25
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,320
I didn't!
Yes you did!

26
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,840
You're a bitch!

27
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,840
Go ahead, kill each other.

28
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,360
Don't worry about the mess.
I'II hose it down after the killing.

29
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,200
Friends, I need some peace.

30
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,640
But Millie, you can't leave them
outside with those butcher knives.

31
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,600
They ain't that sharp.

32
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,840
Georgia.

33
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,080
We are not being raised right.

34
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,760
Hi daddy.

35
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,080
Sweet girls, daddy's got
a surprise for you.

36
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,000
A big surprise.

37
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,480
Is it a puppy?

38
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,680
Meet your new baby sister.
Her name is Maine.

39
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,280
Is her momma dead, too?

40
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,520
No, her mom's in a crazy house
in Bangor.

41
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,680
Theodore.

42
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,400
Hi, momma.

43
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,360
These better be
your soiled shorts in here.

44
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,240
Give me those knives.

45
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,120
Don't you sound that horn

46
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,760
at me, you son of a bitch.
Leave another child at my doorstep.

47
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,120
Things are gonna be different
for you, Maine.

48
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,160
I promise you that.

49
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,960
Thanks for coming in, John.
You know how the show works, right?

50
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,720
Yeah, you find me a date.

51
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,800
Right. That is true.

52
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,600
But first, you need to tell me
what you look for in a woman.

53
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,720
Well, I want to re-enact
every scene from "9 1/2 Weeks."

54
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,600
You know, that movie with
Kim Bassinger and that guy.

55
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,000
When I meet my date,
I don't even want to know her name.

56
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,360
Are you following this, Carolina?
Loud and clear, Dave.

57
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,960
John.
John.

58
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,080
Hi, it's Maine.
Code word grim.

59
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,760
John, this is my assistant, Snake.
He's gonna take over for a second.

60
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,800
Wait, how do you know what I want?
John, it's what I do.

61
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,960
Maine?

62
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,200
Carolina, hello.
Grandma broke my riding crop.

63
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,680
Maine, you said code word grim.

64
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,440
And why are you speaking
in the phony British accent?

65
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,160
Grandma locked herself in the
dressing room and won't come out.

66
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,800
Okay, tell me.

67
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,240
They advertised a $89 VCR in the
paper but the sale ended yesterday.

68
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,760
Grandma said that's a crock of shit.
Snapped my riding crop in half

69
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,480
and locked herself in
the dressing room. Two hours ago.

70
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,960
Maine, just so you know, you lost
your accent on that last part.

71
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,120
Is Georgia with you?
Why yes. She is.

72
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,480
Georgia, it's Carolina.

73
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,400
Hi, what's up?

74
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,080
Can't you do something before this
ends up in another police report?

75
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,080
Maine!

76
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,480
Wait, we have movement.

77
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,360
Get me some toilet paper, honey,

78
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,560
cause I gotta go to the bathroom.

79
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,760
$56.90, lady, you win.

80
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,680
I want to experience you.

81
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,880
Who, me?
Sorry I'm late.

82
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,040
All my wonderful people.

83
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,120
Daphne St. Claire
is in the building.

84
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,560
Nice to see you.
How are you. Nice to see you.

85
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,040
Hello, my dear.

86
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,600
Look at all these people.
They've been camped out for days.

87
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,640
It's like a Pearl Jam concert.
You know why?

88
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,600
No, Albert, enlighten me.

89
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,600
Daphne's books unlock
the mysteries of love.

90
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,160
We're next.
Daphne is an oracle.

91
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,080
What would the oracle say about
the mysteries of my love life?

92
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,920
You always pick the wrong guy.
They either dump you, or...

93
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,840
you dump them.
You never get past the third date.

94
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,400
That's not true.
I have a fourth date tonight.

95
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,840
There you are, darling.
Have a nice day.

96
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,520
Wow!

97
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,120
Miss St. Claire, I can't tell you
what it means to finally meet you.

98
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,280
Well, hello, darling.

99
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,200
That's the second bad accent
I've heard today.

100
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,640
Who shall I make this out to?

101
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,640
Albert Morris.

102
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,640
I love all your books.

103
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,280
They'rejust so...

104
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,640
glamorous.

105
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,920
Like you. Daphne, tell me...

106
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,600
How do you write
about love so well?

107
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,120
Are you gay?

108
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,920
Not gay. Just a fan.

109
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,720
All hearts know about love.
All you have to do is listen.

110
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,760
She was good this time, wasn't she?
She was sober this time.

111
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,440
Your publisher should really hire a
better actress for your next book.

112
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,160
Remember, I want a full report
on the fourth date in the morning.

113
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,160
You have one message.

114
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,400
Hi, Carolina. This is Blake.

115
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,800
Listen, about tonight...
Something came up.

116
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,640
Morning.

117
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,560
Good morning, Carolina.

118
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,840
How was the fourth date?

119
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,720
He cancelled.

120
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,920
He dumped you?

121
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,040
You all right?

122
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,400
Of course I am.
I've forgotten about it already.

123
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,720
You should move, Allie.

124
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,000
You an afford a house
in Beverly Hills or adjacent.

125
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,640
And I hear they keep their car
stereos for 6 months around there.

126
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,160
No, I like the ambience here.

127
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,880
The ever-changing graffiti,

128
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,800
the distinct aroma of urine
in the air...

129
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,520
Wondering why that helicopter
keeps circling over my head.

130
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,040
I like our morning ritual. It makes
me feel like I've got a real job.

131
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,680
Have a great day at work.

132
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,480
Yeah, you too. Take care.

133
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
Hi.

134
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,840
Okay.

135
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,320
I don't normally do this,

136
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,080
but I don't think that people who
do this are freaks. Necessarily.

137
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,680
Anyway, I'm looking for a woman.

138
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,760
Hi.

139
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,520
I'm funny and I'm fun and...

140
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,320
I'm a good dancer, good kisser,

141
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,640
and I'm looking for someone
"who is nice and has a good job".

142
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,840
I got to see
"some pearly white teeth".

143
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,960
You can't be missing teeth. And no
yellow teeth, know what I'm saying?

144
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,120
A sense of humor is key.

145
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,120
Cause a lot of women,
they don't get my sense of humor.

146
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,160
They think I'm rude,
sarcastic or arrogant

147
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,160
It gets misinterpreted.

148
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,680
I like to feel her skin
and I like to...

149
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,680
see and taste and...

150
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,480
that's, you know,
I'm in touch with my senses.

151
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,000
And rather than me tell you,
I'll tell you what I've heard.

152
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,600
Men and women should be
equal partners in life.

153
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,600
Men and women should be
equal partners in life.

154
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,960
Anyway,

155
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,560
my name's Heath Pierson.

156
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,800
I'm fresh off

157
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,360
the Virgin 747 to Los Angeles
and I'm new here.

158
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,760
So...

159
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,080
Snake!
Yeah?

160
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,760
I am the one they call Snake.
Who's that guy?

161
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,480
He's one of the late ones
after you left.

162
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,600
Put him on with that Kate girl.
Kate? All right.

163
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,680
Why is it so quiet?
Where is everybody?

164
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,440
Well, tomorrow is Thanksgiving.

165
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,960
Daphne? Are you there?
I've got to go.

166
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,040
Are you all set?

167
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,680
Daphne, aren't you ready yet?

168
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,760
Princess Tabitha has just been
kidnapped by Roark

169
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,520
the Pirate, who has dragged her
into his lair of wanton desire.

170
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,400
Isn't that the third "pirate capture
the princess" story you've written?

171
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,280
Pirates are classic.

172
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,520
And why are all the girls always
princesses, tell me that?

173
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,920
All women are princesses.
Guess what happens next.

174
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,280
She caresses
his throbbing manhood.

175
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,080
No, too soon, my pretty.

176
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,400
Guess again.

177
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,600
She removes her bodice
with trembling hands.

178
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,680
No, he'll remove it. He'll do it.
Last guess, make it a good one.

179
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,040
Okay.
His hands slowly roam

180
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,280
his newly conquered territory.

181
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,880
That I like.

182
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,560
I'll have to drive at warp speed.

183
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,480
Okay, let's go, thief.
Save, save, save!

184
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,280
The weathertoday in Los Angeles,
temperatures in the low to mid 80's.

185
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,360
Breezy at times, with a few
scattered clouds and smog levels.

186
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,760
Boy does your grandmother live
in a strange part of Los Angeles.

187
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,520
Why is it so hard to be
an adult around my family?

188
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,680
That's why I left my family

189
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,800
3,000 miles away and came here.

190
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,400
Grandma'll make a scene, someone'll
get drunk and try to shoot someone.

191
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,360
Georgia will end up crying for no
reason. It's like family voodoo.

192
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,400
That's why I like it.

193
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,440
Grandma likes you, but if she knew
you were Daphne she'd kill you.

194
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,880
Hey, Chang, how are you doing?

195
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,920
Hello.

196
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,840
Hey!
Hey!

197
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,200
How's your wee thing hanging,
Albert?

198
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,760
Awee bit to the left.
Oh, yeah.

199
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,240
Carolina, how're you doing, baby?

200
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,320
I'm good, how are you?
I'm good, baby.

201
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,720
These are for you.
Thank you.

202
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,160
Why did you go waste your money on
something that's gonna die anyway?

203
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,600
Cause I wanted to.

204
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,160
Well, next time,
make it perfume.

205
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,520
So how are you, grandma?

206
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,560
I'm as nervous as a whore
in church, honey.

207
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,480
I've got all this food to cook up
for my crazy family.

208
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,240
Would you let me help this time?
No, you'll just get in the way.

209
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,200
Well, I hear you're bringing
your new man.

210
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,360
I broke up with him.

211
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,680
You broke up with him?

212
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,680
Carolina.

213
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,640
Lying your ass off
is unbecoming, honey.

214
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,880
You go see Maine. She's been
hollering for you all day.

215
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,080
I swear that child is one taco
short of a combination plate.

216
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,920
Albert, come in here
and get your belly full.

217
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,920
I've got a present for you.
Don't you knock?

218
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,840
Mirabeaus don't knock.
Maine, we have no boundaries.

219
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,320
What are you doing?

220
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Maine is winning the lottery.

221
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,200
Is that so?

222
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,080
The rocking horse boy rode so hard
he went into a trance

223
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,680
and in the trance he saw the winning
horse's name before each race.

224
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,520
You reading D.H. Lawrence now?

225
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,400
I put big money on the Kentucky
Derby and I'm gonna win the lottery.

226
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,000
I've already seen two winning
lottery numbers. 4 and 27, see?

227
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,960
4 and 27.

228
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,360
If you insist on patronizing me,
please leave.

229
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,520
You're clouding my trance.

230
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,840
What's that?

231
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,200
Onscreen programming.

232
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,560
You can set the timer to record
your favorite shows. See?

233
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,520
Don't let technology scare you.

234
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,080
Nothing scares me, kid.
I just want you to do it for it.

235
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,760
Hey.

236
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,800
Guess what? Grandma got a top of the
line VCR. It only cost her 50 bucks.

237
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,600
So I heard.

238
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,680
Shut.

239
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,360
You gotta do what you gotta do,
Carolina.

240
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,320
Life is serious business.

241
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,320
I got me my leather interiors
with that toilet paper trick.

242
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,360
Works every single time.
No bullshit.

243
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,240
Okay, all you lazy

244
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
good-for-nothing goldbrickers.

245
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,200
Dinner is served.
Come and get it.

246
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,000
If grandma offers you
jerky or chitlings say no.

247
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,680
Well.

248
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,720
I see your Aunt Marilyn
brought her breasts.

249
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,880
Warning one, Albert.
How long was she in for?

250
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,560
Three months.

251
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,160
Aunt Marilyn used her
little black book again.

252
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,080
Police chief, who was into high
heels, let her out on good behavior.

253
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,760
Inspiring. She should write a book.
Daphne St. Claire could co-write it.

254
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,880
Over Daphne's dead body.
Daphne could use the research.

255
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,160
Would you really sleep with a $50
a night hooker and pay for it?

256
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,680
I don't know about paying for it.

257
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,920
No, seriously.

258
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,440
Seriously?

259
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,800
I've never really been
a one-night-stand kind of guy.

260
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,440
So you've been in love with
all the women you've slept with?

261
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,760
Well...

262
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,360
Well, how many have there been?

263
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,800
Afew.

264
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,520
Okay, but how many?

265
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,360
Hey, back off.

266
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,600
So you really think you know
what love feels like?

267
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,680
Come on, Carolina,
stop dawdling.

268
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,960
Come on.
Yes, Ma'am.

269
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,480
No, I don't eat meat any more,
remember?

270
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,680
And you wonder why
you can't find a man?

271
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,360
Watch it.

272
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,120
Next.

273
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,480
Got it close, didn't I?

274
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,400
What's that in your hand?

275
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,120
It's a party, isn't it?

276
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,120
What's with you

277
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,880
and my daughter?
Ain't you having sex yet?

278
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,040
What?

279
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,520
No, no. We're just good friends,
that's all.

280
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,400
What's the matter?
She not good enough for you?

281
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,480
No, no.
What?

282
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,080
I mean, yes, of course she is...
She's just...

283
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,800
friends and sex don't mix.

284
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,840
Where's... I'm sorry, what's
his name, your new boyfriend?

285
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,960
Seth.
Right.

286
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,920
I broke his heart.

287
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,960
Why do I keep doing that?

288
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,840
What happened?

289
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,400
I told him my baby wasn't his.

290
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,560
You're pregnant?

291
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,880
How can you be pregnant?

292
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,520
The usual way.

293
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,040
Do you know who the father is?

294
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,280
Excuse me?

295
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,440
I mean, of course, of course
you know who the father is. Right?

296
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,800
I do.

297
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,120
Well, do you want me
to go with you?

298
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,600
I'm gonna keep it.

299
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,040
You're gonna raise a baby
all by yourself?

300
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,360
You don't have a job.
You've never had a job.

301
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,600
I tried to get ajob once.

302
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,200
I didn't have the right shoes.

303
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,600
Don't tell grandma, okay?

304
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,920
I'll tell her.
When the time's right.

305
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,880
Okay?

306
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,240
Grandma, have you read
Daphne St. Claire's new book?

307
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,760
Oh, you're damned straight
I have.

308
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,400
That's what you need, girl.

309
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,040
A man like Ashlen China
from "Roughing it at Midnight."

310
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,040
Ashlen's from "Moonlight Rhapsody."
He's not her type.

311
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,760
You read the romances, Marilyn?

312
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,920
Oh, I already know
all I need to know.

313
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,680
I bet you do.

314
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,680
I like you, Albert, because you're
a man who has no shame about reading

315
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,080
the romances.

316
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,160
Did you read
"Love's Sacred Desire"?

317
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,360
Crap!

318
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,560
You didn't like "Desire"?

319
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,840
No. That Daphne St. Claire
shot her wad on that one.

320
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,080
Too much talking,
not enough loving.

321
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,840
What she needs to do is get drunk
and howl at the moon.

322
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,320
I agree.

323
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,360
You could use a little howling
yourself, honey.

324
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,400
I'm focusing on my career.

325
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,880
Okay, but your titties aren't gonna
stay perfect forever, you know.

326
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,000
Well, that's what surgery's for.

327
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,480
Right.

328
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,600
You got one big problem, Carolina.
It's called bad man picking.

329
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,960
How can you say that when you've
only met one guy I've been with?

330
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,320
I don't need to meet the rooster
when I got the hen right here.

331
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,600
And the hen's not happy.

332
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,280
The hen is, too, happy.

333
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,400
The hen looks down on
her grandma

334
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,240
cause the grandma leads her life
exactly anyway she damn pleases.

335
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,240
In fact,
the hen hates her grandma

336
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,520
cause of that.
I do not.

337
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,640
It'sjust that I would
do things differently.

338
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,480
Oh, really, how's that?

339
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,240
Everybody.

340
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,640
I have an announcement to make.
This year

341
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,920
I'm gonna have a formal Christmas
sit-down dinner

342
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,680
at my house. And I hope
all of you can make it.

343
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,240
This is where we eat, Carolina.
You know that.

344
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,080
But wouldn't it be nice if...?
Lf?

345
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,240
If a frog had wings he wouldn't
bump his ass so much. No.

346
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,760
Well, what about you guys?

347
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,200
Anyone?

348
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,040
Daddy?

349
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,760
Why don't you girlsjust figure this
out and tell me where you want me?

350
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,640
I can't believe he just sat there
and did nothing.

351
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,240
He was drunk.

352
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,320
That was his excuse when he drove us
off the overpass when I was ten.

353
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,040
What happened.

354
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,560
We all died, Albert.

355
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,760
The reservoir was full of sand.

356
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,280
She'll never come, will she?

357
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,080
She'll come.

358
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,960
Hey, I can't even wait
for Christmas.

359
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,800
Night.

360
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,600
Welcome to our local show.

361
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,040
I'm Desie Dean.

362
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,800
Welcome to the Perfect Date
pre-show.

363
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,560
First, to warm us up, my friends
swami Hemichandra.

364
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,640
La-mastra everybody. The warm up
is stand up, everybody cold.

365
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,400
Are you Carolina?

366
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,360
Yeah, yes.
Hi. I'm Heath Pierson.

367
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,880
Snake says you're the one to thank
for choosing me as a contestant.

368
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,000
You're welcome, Heath.
Was it a successful date?

369
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,360
Yes, yes it was.
The romance wasn't there, but...

370
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,800
we had a good time.

371
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,280
What a great attitude. Most people,
if it's not love at first sight,

372
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,000
they wished they had never
come on the show. Why did you?

373
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,200
I lost a bet with someone in my
office. But I thought, 'Why not?"

374
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,200
I'm new to L. A,
I don't know anyone.

375
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,160
And it's a difficult city
to meet people in, as you know.

376
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,360
We're on in 10 minutes.

377
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,480
You don't want that on you.

378
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,640
Hello, everybody.
Okay, is anyone nervous?

379
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,080
Don't be. The hard part's over.
You've already had the date.

380
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,320
Now all you have to do
is tell Chuck all about it.

381
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,360
My date hated me. I could tell.
I'm sure she didn't, John.

382
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,440
Actually, he's right.
He's a complete asshole.

383
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,160
Okay. Tara, you know you can't
say "asshole" on TV, right?

384
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,360
He took notes on everything I did.
And my name's not Tara, it's Kate.

385
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,800
I'm Tara.

386
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,200
And I didn't hate my date.
He was totally hot.

387
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,040
Oh, I see.

388
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,800
Okay, Kate.

389
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,600
Let's stick to positive comments
when we're on the air, okay?

390
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,120
I understand. You screwed up.

391
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,240
I should have had him.

392
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,960
Hello, I'm your new P.A.
Kristine.

393
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,360
Phone call

394
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,440
for Carolina.
Take a message, please.

395
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,680
Snake said to tell you that
Georgia's blowing chunks.

396
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,360
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

397
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,960
Kristine, can you please escort our
contestants to the holding room?

398
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,040
Okie dokie, you've got it.

399
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,480
So who knows where
the holding room is?

400
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,040
From Hollywood,

401
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,440
it's your favorite game show,
"The Perfect Date." And now here's

402
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,160
your perfect host,
Chuck McBride.

403
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,600
Keep it coming. I can feel it.
I can feel it. I need your love.

404
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,320
Georgia, you're supposed
to throw up all the time.

405
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,320
Maybe because there's a person
growing inside you.

406
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,240
We sent two contestants
on a blind date.

407
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,480
You get to see the results right
here. And then you get to decide.

408
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,080
Was it the perfect date!

409
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,960
What a putz.

410
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,160
Let's see those first two guests
right now. Here are Heath Pierson

411
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,640
and Tara Barnell.

412
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,040
Carolina!

413
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,920
What? You still haven't told
grandma you're pregnant yet?

414
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,040
Carolina!

415
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,360
Georgia, I'll call you back.

416
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,080
Do we still have anyone working
around this piece of crap show?

417
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,600
Job opening.

418
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,000
I am so sorry.
I heard what happened.

419
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,280
How did you know
this was my car?

420
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,560
Your name is on the fence.

421
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,880
Souvenir.

422
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,680
Do you want me
to sign it for you?

423
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,840
You're funny.

424
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,920
Yeah, well,
Chuck overruled funny.

425
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,280
You have to believe there's
something better coming along.

426
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,160
I'm guessing you don't want to work
a game show the rest of your life.

427
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,880
You must be from a rich family.

428
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,200
I thought so.

429
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,080
Well,

430
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,080
I can afford to buy you dinner.

431
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,120
You get me fired
and you want to buy me dinner?

432
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,600
Excellent question.

433
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,360
I hope you told him
to bugger off.

434
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,480
He must be really,
really good looking.

435
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,720
Yes, but...
I thought so.

436
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,600
Otherwise you wouldn't go out
with a guy who got you fired.

437
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,000
He didn't get me fired,
Georgia did.

438
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,120
Georgia didn't get you fired.
You got yourself fired.

439
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,960
You have to learn how to say no.

440
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,360
Like to this Heath person.

441
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,880
Pierson. It's Heath Pierson.
I mean person.

442
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,960
Like this stupid Heath person.

443
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,000
What? Oh, who cares?

444
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,000
I got fired and I came over
to talk to you

445
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,480
because you're my best friend and
all we're doing is argue about it.

446
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,200
State your business.
It's Carolina.

447
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,000
I need you to say you're coming
to Christmas dinner right now.

448
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,040
Listen, baby, I got me
a fur person now.

449
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,480
And fur people
who do not understand

450
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,840
formal sit down dinners...
"Nobody's gonna come if you don't"

451
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,000
I need you to do this for me,
please.

452
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,360
Are you crying, baby?

453
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,400
Yes or no?

454
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,640
Why are you crying, honey?

455
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,640
Bye, grandma.

456
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,400
And remember you're hauling
Georgia's butt here this weekend.

457
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,360
I won't forget.

458
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,400
All right.

459
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,840
Hello.

460
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,920
It's me.

461
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,640
May I come in?

462
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,600
I'm sorry.

463
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,040
I wasn't very sympathetic.

464
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,240
Where'd that come from?

465
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,280
I have 53 dollars

466
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,920
in my savings account.
I have to go and look for a job.

467
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,680
And the milk goes bad in two days.
What am I gonna do, Albert?

468
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,360
You get an interview
with the big boys.

469
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,680
You put on your black suit,
pull your hair into that little...

470
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,440
twisty thing, and they'll
fall in love with you

471
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,480
and hire you on the spot.

472
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,240
There are 150 people applying
for one job in television.

473
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,040
Maybe.

474
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,520
But there's only one Carolina.

475
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,480
Towel.

476
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,120
You want to go to the movies
tomorrow night?

477
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,960
Tomorrow night's my date
with Heath.

478
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,400
I know we met under unusual
circumstances, but...

479
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,920
I wanted to ask you out to dinner
the moment I saw you.

480
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,440
You did?

481
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,880
You were biting your lower lip.

482
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,160
I was?

483
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,280
It was very, very sexy.

484
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,080
Are you for real?

485
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,720
Are you just

486
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,480
randomly throwing out lines
or are you telling the truth?

487
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,840
I guess I'm randomly
telling the truth.

488
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,720
So, you're from London.
Tell me about that.

489
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,320
Well, there's not much to tell.

490
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,560
I have a younger sister,
Sara,

491
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,120
and my father's a banker.
My mother teaches English at Oxford,

492
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,320
which is where I went to university.
I played on the cricket team.

493
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,400
I'm an executive at an advertising
agency, and I have a flat in Paris.

494
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,920
Do you have a wife and kids? Even
if they're in Tulsa, I want to know.

495
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,920
Why are you staring at me?

496
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,040
No wife, no kids.
Where's Tulsa?

497
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,760
In Oklahoma. It's a state.

498
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,760
Like Carolina the state?

499
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,920
Yes, I was named after a state.

500
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,920
My sisters, Georgia and Maine
were also named after states.

501
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,560
Whatever state my father happened
to be in when we were born.

502
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,280
We were named after postmarks.
Those are

503
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,640
on postcards, but you don't
want to hear about that.

504
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,840
I don't?

505
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,360
No.

506
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,960
North or south?

507
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,240
What?

508
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,240
Carolina.

509
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,360
I had a wonderful time tonight.

510
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,840
So did I.

511
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,760
Carolina the state.

512
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,040
North or south.

513
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,080
Yep. South.

514
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,200
Definitely South Carolina.

515
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,920
Are you sure you want
to move in with grandma?

516
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,880
Well, I can't raise a baby
by myself.

517
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,920
You could move in with me.
Oh, sweet.

518
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,320
So super sweet, but you know, the
baby will have Maine to play with.

519
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,920
You know me, I like a lot
of energy around me.

520
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,240
Well, you have told grandmother
that you're pregnant, right?

521
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,280
Right?

522
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,960
Well, I'm still waiting
for the perfect time to tell her.

523
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,560
Back up, back up.

524
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,920
Back in the car. I'm bored.
We're going to the movies.

525
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,480
Come on.
Let's unload the U-Haul first.

526
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,200
I don't want to do any work.
I want to go be entertained by some

527
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,280
black and white piece of crap.

528
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,680
I'm off duty when I'm dreaming.

529
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,680
You smiling rat bastard,
you're gonna be dead soon.

530
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,720
Grandma, please.
Keep it down!

531
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,880
I want popcorn.

532
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,280
Not spending six bucks on twenty
cents worth of popcorn, honey.

533
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,800
I made this gumbo yesterday.
You're gonna eat it and be happy.

534
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,960
How are you feeling, Ben?
I thought you were sick.

535
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,520
Well, ask her where
she was last night.

536
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,080
Show's up there, buddy.

537
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,880
I want popcorn.
Stop, stop.

538
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,360
Jeff, why don't you tell me you've
been working hard at the bank.

539
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,160
Who'd you put out for, Popsicle?
Sure as hell can't act worth a lick.

540
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,760
Will you shut up?

541
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,520
Listen, sonny...

542
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,640
Grandma, I'm pregnant.

543
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,920
Georgia, now is not the time.

544
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,840
What?

545
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,360
Hold it.

546
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,680
Hold it.
You hold it.

547
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,000
Well thank you for revealing
that little tidbit of information

548
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,760
before you unloaded the U-Haul.

549
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,120
Cause my child-rearing days
are over, sunshine.

550
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,360
It's not gonna cost a thing.
I'm gonna breastfeed it.

551
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,960
Can we talk about this
in the lobby, please?

552
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,280
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to
take your seat and lower your voice.

553
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,160
What are you?

554
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,760
I'm the manager, ma'am.

555
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,080
How old are you, Mr. Manager?
Twenty, ma'am.

556
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,840
Listen. Carefully,
you leave now.

557
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,640
I can't do that, ma'am.

558
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,560
You know murder is a funny thing.

559
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,840
It happens to all sorts of people
in all sorts of places.

560
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,720
Nobody's safe any more.

561
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,240
Even little snot-nosed, pudgy

562
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,360
theatre managers running up and
down the aisle with a flashlight.

563
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,600
We never get to see the end
of the movie when you come.

564
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,000
I'm gonna calm Maine down and
get Georgia's stuff to my house.

565
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,840
You think it's a good idea,
do you?

566
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,560
Saddling yourself with two kids when
you don't even have a job yourself.

567
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,040
Yes, I do.

568
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,760
I thought you'd be
on your horse.

569
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,560
I'm not in the mood.

570
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,600
And what about your numbers?

571
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,920
I've only got two numbers left.

572
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,680
Girls, get your butts

573
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,160
out here and help Georgia
unload the U-Haul.

574
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,960
She's pregnant, for God's sake.

575
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,680
Come on, get your butts out.

576
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,440
So I moved Georgia in.

577
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,400
And still she's gonna have a baby
with no father around.

578
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,000
I can't believe she's gonna let
history repeat itself like that.

579
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,720
She has her own free will.
She can do what she wants.

580
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,920
Yeah, but she's not even taking it
seriously. It's no big deal to her.

581
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,920
She's doing something unexpected.
It's not unexpected, you're right.

582
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,400
You know, the problem isn't her.
It's you.

583
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,600
What?

584
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,440
Things don't always have to go
according to plan.

585
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,400
Your plan.

586
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,560
No.

587
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,080
Let go. And for God's sake,
Carolina,

588
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,400
live a little.

589
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,560
Carolina Mirabeau.

590
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,960
Live a little.

591
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,200
Happy birthday, Carolina.

592
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,200
It's my birthday.
Happy birthday to you.

593
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,200
Happy, happy, happy birthday.

594
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,480
What are you doing for Christmas?

595
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,840
All right?
Yes, you look lovely, darling.

596
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,120
Come here.

597
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,240
You're gonna be late.

598
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,000
Who cares?
I'm having fun.

599
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,440
Oh, Albert,

600
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,360
come out here.
I want you to meet somebody.

601
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,760
Hey.

602
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,720
Albert. Heath,
this is Albert Morris,

603
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,840
my neighbor.
My neighbor and best friend.

604
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,040
Hi. Heath Pierson.
I've heard a lot about you.

605
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,200
You have?

606
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,960
Well I've heard
a lot about you too.

607
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,720
Good. Of course.

608
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,040
Did you get my birthday card?
I left it on your doorstep.

609
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,880
Yes. Thank you.

610
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,640
Did you read it?

611
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,080
I haven't gotten a chance
to open it yet.

612
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,360
Of course, you were busy.

613
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,880
Well, read the card.

614
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,240
And if you're still interested,
let me know, okay?

615
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,040
I should be off.
Nice to meet you, Albert.

616
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,200
Can we do that again, please?

617
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,040
When we get to the piano dynamic,
keep the tempo...

618
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,480
Do you think the musicians
ever miss a note?

619
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,400
Of course.
Nobody's perfect.

620
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,480
That's why there's
so many of them up there.

621
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,160
Enjoy your present now.

622
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,520
They're all playing for you.

623
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,080
Why don't you like him, Albert?
You don't even know him.

624
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,000
I know him.

625
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,760
Now he is perfect.
He's Flawless Man.

626
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,880
Flawless body without working out,
flawless smile, never runs out gas,

627
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,640
never breaks a sweat.
Never says the wrong thing.

628
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,560
Makes us ordinary guys
feel invisible.

629
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,720
You got all that
from one hello?

630
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,120
I'm a writer. Ljudge character
faster than a speeding bullet.

631
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,640
I thought we didn't judge.

632
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,200
We judge when the rules are broken.
You slept with him last night

633
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,000
on the 2nd date at your house.
That breaks every Carolina rule.

634
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,400
But I've lived a little,
Albert.

635
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,080
I want a normal, available guy,
and I think I've found one.

636
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,560
He makes me happy.

637
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,320
Anyone named Heath Pierson
is not a normal guy.

638
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,080
I saw his car.

639
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,760
A Jaguar.

640
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,560
He's not a normal guy.

641
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,520
I invited him to Christmas dinner.

642
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,760
You did what?

643
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,640
Christmas dinner's for family.

644
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,760
And what about you, anyway?
You write about all this passion

645
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,280
and romance and
"my love for you is endless."

646
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,280
When was the last time
you went on a date?

647
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,520
As it so happens,
I do have a date.

648
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,800
Come on, you do not, Albert.

649
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,760
I do, too.
Why is that so surprising?

650
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,280
A fourth date, in fact.
She's a writer.

651
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,480
And not another Daphne write, but a
New York Times bestseller writer.

652
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,560
I met her

653
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,440
at my publisher's holiday party
two weeks ago. Enjoy the concert.

654
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,400
...four bars straight there.
Join in the fun. A little more Sax.

655
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,440
So you're telling me you honestly
don't know what happened?

656
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,560
No. It's just not like Albert.

657
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,280
It is hard work being so dense,
Carolina.

658
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,400
What is that supposed to mean?

659
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,240
Why don't you take a ride on Maine's
horse and see what come up.

660
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,560
Be careful,
that's my wedding china.

661
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,040
Why can't you just say
what you mean?

662
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,680
All right.
Here's a thought.

663
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,760
Forget about Albert, forget
about Maine and forget about me,

664
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,200
for that matter.

665
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,760
What about you, Carolina?
Why is your life so hard?

666
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:47,120
Makes me think you're living
somebody else's instead.

667
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,680
Okay. Okay, fine.

668
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,080
Tomorrow is Christmas dinner. I want
you there more than anyone else.

669
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,480
Shit! Why didn't you say so
in the first place?

670
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,880
Hi. You look nice.

671
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,920
Carolina.

672
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,280
Look at these plates. Grandma
lent them to me for Christmas.

673
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,480
All this time using paper plates
and she had an entire set of china.

674
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,640
Can you believe that?
Carolina.

675
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,200
Anyway, I want to apologize for
the Hollywood Bowl thing yesterday.

676
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,000
Carolina.
You can date whoever.

677
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:30,560
Or is it whomever? Whatever.
Anyway, it's really not my business.

678
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,880
I'm just glad you're getting
out there and taking chances.

679
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,160
And she's a writer,

680
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,800
a real writer.

681
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,320
Carolina, she's here.

682
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,680
Debbie, this is Carolina, my friend.
Carolina, this is Debbie.

683
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,600
Hi, it's nice to meet you.
Albert's told me a lot about you.

684
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,160
Albert's told me
a lot about you, too.

685
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,960
I mean,
he was just about to tell me

686
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:56,120
more than he has,
like that you're pretty and smart,

687
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,800
which you are obviously.
You look great. You two look great.

688
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:04,360
Together. A couple. So where
are you guys going, anyway?

689
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,000
To a Christmas Eve service.

690
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,000
My mom and dad and I

691
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,440
go every year.
It's kind of a family tradition.

692
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,080
That's lovely.

693
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:56,840
All you lazy, good-for-nothing
goldbrickers, dinner is served.

694
00:46:58,520 --> 00:46:59,800
Merry Christmas.

695
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,720
Grandma, I told you
not to bring anything.

696
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,160
How are you gonna feed all these
people with one piddly bird?

697
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,080
Now, nobody eat.

698
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,240
Grandma's gotta pee.

699
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,720
She brought her own turkey.

700
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,200
I know. I saw.

701
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,240
Albert. Are you staying?

702
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,120
Of course.
What about Debbie?

703
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,640
She's with her parents.
We're gonna meet after dinner.

704
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,800
I don't have a name card for you.

705
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,160
That's okay.
I can remember my own name.

706
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,600
Oh, here, sit there.
Aunt Marilyn got arrested again.

707
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,920
Carolina, honey,
you're out of toilet paper.

708
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,320
Okay, who wants to say grace?

709
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,680
I do.

710
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,200
Albert, I love you like a son,
honey, but you Jewish people...

711
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,800
you can't kill Christ and expect to
have a conversation with him later.

712
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:11,040
Fine. He's all yours.
I'll chat with him over dessert.

713
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,560
I'll get it, I'll get it.
Go ahead, carry on.

714
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,440
Who's missing?

715
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,840
Everybody, this is Heath.
Heath, everybody.

716
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,720
My family.

717
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,800
Sorry I'm late everyone.

718
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,040
Happy Christmas.

719
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:50,240
Wine. How lovely. I think
I have an opener in the kitchen.

720
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,600
Who the hell is that?

721
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,360
Language, girl.
No one knows who the hell it is.

722
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,360
There's a lot of people.
Yeah.

723
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,600
Your lipstick's smeared.

724
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,960
Thank you, Maine. Grandma,
will you please say grace?

725
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,960
Certainly.

726
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,880
Everyone bow their heads,
please.

727
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,520
Lord, bless my family.

728
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,880
Fill their bellies
and keep them warm and safe.

729
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,480
And now, let's get personal.

730
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,440
Please find Georgia

731
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,520
a man to daddy that young'un

732
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,000
that she's carrying.
Grandma...

733
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,000
Give Maine those lottery numbers
before she loses her virginity

734
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,600
on that rocking horse.

735
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,120
Lord, let my Teddy settle down
and plant some roots.

736
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:57,200
Look over my sister Marilyn who,
bless her soul, is back injail.

737
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,880
Enlighten her about
cellular telephones

738
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,920
and credit card transactions,
both of which are traceable.

739
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,360
And finally, Lord,

740
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,840
bless my Carolina's heart

741
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,120
for she is the best part of me.

742
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,520
Amen.

743
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,360
Amen.

744
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,440
Daddy, I think you should
carve the turkey.

745
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:36,800
Okay.

746
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,120
I think you got yourself
a dilemma, son.

747
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,040
I've got two fine-Iooking turkeys

748
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,840
front of me here.

749
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,880
And I'mjust one man.

750
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,840
I'd like to ask Al

751
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,480
to give me a hand.

752
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,600
Al?

753
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,280
I'll go get another knife.

754
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:00,520
Let's move this Martha Stewart shit
out of the way and move this turkey.

755
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,400
Maine, what kind of horses
do you ride?

756
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,000
Dead ones.

757
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,640
So you were raised in Britain?

758
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,040
I was raised right god damn here.

759
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,320
Language.

760
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,040
What happened to your accent?

761
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,400
I'm over it.

762
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,040
No, everyone has to pass
to the right.

763
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,840
This way.
Oh, to the right.

764
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,800
Congratulations on the baby.
Where is the father to be?

765
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,640
One night stand.

766
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,520
Daddy,

767
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,640
Heath works in advertising.
Oh, that's good work.

768
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,040
Have you done anything
that I might know?

769
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:44,480
Well, my firm did those
Absolut Vodka themed ads.

770
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,560
You know.

771
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,320
Bond. Absolut Bond.

772
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,040
Oh, yeah.

773
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,520
That was you?

774
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,200
So what kind of work
do you do, sir?

775
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,640
I'm a drunk.

776
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,960
Been 30 days since my last drink.
Daddy, really?

777
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,400
Big love, Daddy.

778
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,480
It's only 30 days.

779
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,880
Why?

780
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:41,200
Because if I leave her alone,
she's gonna pee on my shoes.

781
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,600
Did I tell you the one
about the time I found Marilyn

782
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,880
playing lollipop with
the reverend under the table?

783
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,880
How about a different story?
Okay.

784
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:04,080
How about the time Marilyn
hit me up side the head

785
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,680
with an axe handle?

786
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,120
Yes, tell that one.
Yeah, how'd you get back at her?

787
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,640
Now, even though I'm the oldest

788
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,920
and Marilyn is the youngest, she was
always built like a brick shithouse.

789
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,160
When she was ten

790
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,920
she didn't have those big boobs

791
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,480
like she's got now.
Well, she was worried about that.

792
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,240
And there was this dance coming up,
and I said: "Marilyn,

793
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:28,000
what you gotta do is get chicken
manure spread on those boobies

794
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,200
and they'll grow faster."
And so,

795
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:35,040
she did. She spread the chicken
manure and she rubbed...

796
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,560
and she rubbed and she rubbed...

797
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,120
And she rubbed for weeks.
Comes the time for the dance,

798
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,520
she stank to high heaven.

799
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,520
And the flies were swarming
all over her.

800
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,000
She never hit me up side the head
with that axe handle

801
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,040
again.

802
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,120
Is that why Aunt Marilyn's
a whore?

803
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,600
She's not a whore, honey.
She's a madam.

804
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,760
She's the madam cause
she likes money without taxation.

805
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,040
Anyone for eggnog?

806
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,840
Yeah, I'll have some.
Thanks, honey.

807
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,800
So Heath, come over here,
honey, and sit down and tell us

808
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,240
all about yourself. Come on.

809
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,120
Actually, Mrs. Mirabeau,
I have to leave, I'm afraid.

810
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,560
Another Christmas party.
One of those boring

811
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,200
office things.

812
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,320
Can I talk to you for a second?

813
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,800
Sure.

814
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,320
Did I tell you the one
about when...

815
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,920
Now listen.
If you have to leave, leave.

816
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:43,080
But first, can you go back
in there and tell Carolina

817
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,520
how much meeting her family
has meant to you and...

818
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,720
and how special a day
it was for you? Can you do that?

819
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,720
Yeah, I can do that.
Can I ask you something?

820
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,640
Shoot.

821
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:59,160
You and Carolina?
Have you got a thing going on?

822
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:01,760
No.

823
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,720
No thing.

824
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,960
Good night everyone.
Off to the races.

825
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,640
Well, I had a good time.

826
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,840
I did.

827
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,840
You got your wish.

828
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:38,440
But next time Christmas is gonna be
in my backyard again. You got it?

829
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,240
I do.

830
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,520
It was harder than I thought it was
gonna be. You make it look easy.

831
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,680
Thank you.

832
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,560
I love you, you know.

833
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,200
I love you too, pet.

834
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,520
Oh, about Heath person of yours...

835
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,320
Nice boy.

836
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,840
Isn't he though?

837
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,320
But stiffer than a preacher's dick
at a wedding.

838
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,640
Good night, pumpkin.

839
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:24,880
Yeah?

840
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,360
Hi.

841
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:29,760
Hey.

842
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,200
I forgot to give you
my Christmas present.

843
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,840
Close your eyes.
Okay.

844
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:45,680
Open them.

845
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,520
Merry Christmas. We're the cleaning
queens of West Hollywood.

846
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,400
Are you ready?
Five, six, seven, eight.

847
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,520
Dusting and sweeping
and scrubbing with Comet

848
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:57,120
We'll clean your mess up
from blood stains to vomit

849
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,840
The sweeper.
The Hoover.

850
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,120
I'm good with a hose.

851
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,960
Smells can't outrun us
cause I'm good with my nose.

852
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,240
Get the stains out.
Scrub that tile grout.

853
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,680
Using decleaning foam.

854
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,400
We'll pass the red glove test
in no time at all.

855
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,640
We'll even Feng Shui your home.

856
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,520
The cleaning queens.

857
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,360
That was great!
I just had a glass ring fall out.

858
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,040
So, leave the dishes to the experts
and come with me.

859
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,760
What is it?

860
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,040
Oh, new Daphne galleys.

861
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,360
Let me see.

862
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,520
You put your own name
on a Daphne book?

863
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,920
It's not a Daphne book.
It's my book.

864
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,160
If you

865
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,600
turn the page there...

866
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,640
For Carolina.
Albert, that's...

867
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,720
I think I'm gonna cry.

868
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:57,360
I've been writing it on and off
for about a year now.

869
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,240
It's about us, really.

870
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,000
You're a sort of...
I mean, it's inspired by us.

871
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,600
Is it bad?

872
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,000
No.

873
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,080
It's... it's...

874
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,560
It's a love story, Carolina.

875
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:22,760
It's everything I've been afraid to
say. Everything I feel about you.

876
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,160
Albert. Oh my God.

877
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,480
Me and Debbie, you and Heath,
you know...

878
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,360
They're great people, yeah,
but they're not our people.

879
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:33,720
Carolina.

880
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,680
This isn't hard.

881
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,440
We were friends first,
which is what's gonna make us last.

882
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,280
I think I'd better go check on
the cleaning crew.

883
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,320
Please don't walk out that door.

884
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,400
This is all so sudden, I...

885
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,920
You tell me that you wrote a book
about us, and that you want us...

886
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,360
That's not fair, really.

887
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,040
I should have known. I should have
known, this is what you do

888
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,160
with every guy that you meet,
but...

889
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:19,720
the joke's on me, isn't it.
Because I thought I was different.

890
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,440
You are different.

891
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,480
You can't just spring this on me.
I...

892
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,200
I don't know what to say.

893
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,400
You just said it.

894
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,720
Why aren't you out with Heath
on New Year's Eve, Carolina?

895
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,320
He didn't call.

896
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,280
What about Albert?

897
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,040
What do you want to wear tonight?

898
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:13,960
You decide.
Is Ernie still married?

899
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,520
The zipper's busted.
Of course Ernie's still married.

900
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,840
How come you're dating
a married man?

901
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,240
Grandma skips that commandment,
Maine.

902
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,160
That's a good one.
Thank you, honey.

903
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,920
Now, you know,
after a while, you learn that

904
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:33,560
the rules of the world don't have to
apply to you. You think about it.

905
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,080
It's all nonsense.

906
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:40,720
It is.

907
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,880
We're here. We die.

908
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,960
Now when I met your grandpa
Herschel we was both 15.

909
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,760
He could drink a whole entire bottle
of soda and never take a breath.

910
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,720
And he had

911
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,000
very clean fingernails.
So I married him.

912
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:05,080
You know, when he died, my true
love died. Soured me on my home.

913
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,400
So...

914
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:09,160
Me and my boy Teddy,
we come west.

915
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:14,200
And here I am.
Asingle grandma.

916
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:20,040
And whenever I need a man,
I got Ernie.

917
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,040
We have an understanding
between us.

918
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:28,240
And, girls, that is a lot
in this world.

919
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:41,120
Thank you for making me so
presentable on New Year's Eve.

920
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:50,920
Evening, Millie.

921
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,160
Evening, Ernie. Thank you.

922
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,640
Yeah. My you look nice tonight.

923
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,280
Okay, thank you.

924
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:00,280
That's a beautiful dress you have.
Thank you.

925
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,600
Now remember.

926
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,760
God said celebrate, not celibate.

927
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,240
Let me get that.

928
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,680
Thanks, Ernie. See you.
Bye.

929
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:14,720
Bye.

930
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,840
So, what do you guys want to do
on New Year's Eve?

931
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,280
Get drunk and watch the ball drop,
what else?

932
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,880
Sounds good.
What's celibate?

933
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:48,920
...a boy. But I had a dream last
night it was a girl. Maybe twins.

934
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:54,680
Well, if you have a girl or a boy,
you could still use this, right?

935
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,600
It has like rockets
and cars and stuff.

936
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,640
And I'm a girl,
and I like rockets and cars.

937
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:03,400
4. 27.

938
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,600
26!

939
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,040
26.

940
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,280
Here you go, hon.
Where's Albert?

941
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,640
We've missed your faces
around here.

942
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,960
Thanks. It's nice to be missed.

943
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,000
Is this seat taken?

944
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,800
How did you find me?

945
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,720
I stopped by your apartment
yesterday but you weren't there.

946
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:07,440
Albert told me you come here
every Monday morning for pancakes.

947
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,840
So you saw Albert?

948
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,680
Can I sit down?

949
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,320
I'm sorry for not returning
your calls, Carolina.

950
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:27,680
Yeah. We sleep together and
you don't call me for five months.

951
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,000
That's pretty typical
around these parts.

952
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:35,200
I had to go back to England
and hold a few hands.

953
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,440
To be honest,
I sort of got cold feet.

954
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,040
But look, I brought you something
by way of atonement.

955
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,080
Open it.

956
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:56,200
Your station is one of our clients
and I made

957
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:59,280
a few calls.
You got me my job back?

958
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:07,680
Wow. That is real Prince
Charming kind of stuff.

959
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,840
To the rescue and all that.

960
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:12,640
But?

961
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,160
I'm sorry.

962
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:20,080
I shouldn't have invited you
to Christmas dinner.

963
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:24,240
It was too soon to throw you
into the Mirabeaus like that.

964
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,720
It's just I was feeling
so sure of myself.

965
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,200
The thing is...

966
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:36,320
I was trying to force someone, you,
into my life and it's like...

967
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,440
you're this beautiful,
expensive Italian suit

968
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,320
and ljust don't have the faintest
idea where I'm gonna wear you.

969
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:49,240
Me and my family...
They're all that I have and...

970
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,360
we're just not suit people.

971
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,840
That's the first time I've ever
been called an Italian suit.

972
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,400
But I think I know
what you're saying.

973
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:09,040
It's funny. I've always thought of
myself as this great communicator.

974
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,440
Advertising and all that.
But...

975
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,200
I sort of blew it with you.

976
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,240
This time.

977
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:17,720
Didn't I?

978
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:38,080
Breathe slow, breathe slow.

979
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,440
That's the way I did it.
I know what you're going through.

980
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:44,880
You have to push harder.

981
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,440
Okay. Wait, wait,
I got something here.

982
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:49,480
Here, here...

983
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,680
Bite, bite, hard!

984
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,240
What is that?

985
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,520
That was the doggie treat.

986
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,800
One more good push.
I can't!

987
01:07:58,960 --> 01:07:59,840
All right.

988
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,480
Now listen to me.

989
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,680
I'm your grandmother,
are you hearing me?

990
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:08,160
Now you breathe deep and push hard.
You push and you push...

991
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:11,240
You push harder, harder, harder,
or I'm gonna go down there

992
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:14,120
and get a plunger
and suck that baby out of you.

993
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:17,920
Okay, open.

994
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,920
Open up. Open up.
I know, I know.

995
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,360
Oh, he's so cute.

996
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,280
He's such a beautiful baby boy.

997
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,560
I'm gonna name him California.

998
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:35,120
Cal for short.
You look like a fairy princess.

999
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,120
Now just give me that little...

1000
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:39,200
I want to see you close up.

1001
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:43,720
He's so precious.

1002
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:45,640
Hey.

1003
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,320
Something wrong with his eyes.

1004
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,960
They're crooked.

1005
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:55,040
Georgia, peach, you been
eating too many egg rolls?

1006
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,040
I'm just so glad
you could make it, son.

1007
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:15,680
Sorry I'm late. Had an "AA" meeting.
Why don't you shovel your sorrys

1008
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,600
elsewhere, cause we're full.

1009
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,480
I had a meeting...
Shut!

1010
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:20,520
...mother.

1011
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:25,120
California Theodore Mirabeau.

1012
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:27,400
That's his name. Lord help him.

1013
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,120
You were called

1014
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:32,200
22 hours ago and that girl
still named her baby

1015
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:36,560
after you. How much of that crap
are you gonna do before you realize

1016
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:39,280
how much life you are missing?

1017
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:42,480
You want the card,

1018
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:43,640
mother?

1019
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:48,360
Oh, he's so cute.

1020
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:53,880
All I've done is screw up
you girls' lives, haven't I?

1021
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,560
You could try harder.

1022
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,760
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday.

1023
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,480
What day should I put
on that ticket?

1024
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,920
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday.

1025
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:37,120
Today, tomorrow,
day after tomorrow. Monday,

1026
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,920
Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday.

1027
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,320
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

1028
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,320
Thursday, Friday.

1029
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:47,520
Friday, Friday.

1030
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:48,960
Today!

1031
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:07,960
Going to school.

1032
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,560
Bye.

1033
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,920
Good breasts, good boobs,
that's what I like.

1034
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:25,000
Hello?

1035
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,920
Carolina? I need you
to go to the bookstore.

1036
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,440
Okay, I'll go tonight.

1037
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,680
You'll go today.
Three o'clock.

1038
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:36,200
I'm working all day, grandma.
For once in your life, obey me.

1039
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:40,200
My book comes in at 3 p.m. Today
at that bookstore that you like.

1040
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,880
They won't hold it
a moment after that, honey.

1041
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,320
I don't know, there's some kind
of run going on it.

1042
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:47,600
All right, all right, I'll go.
I'll get it for you.

1043
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,240
Bye bye, honey.

1044
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,080
All right, see you.
Next.

1045
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,280
One ticket.

1046
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:10,640
You got ID?

1047
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,160
No ID, no 24 million.

1048
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:17,360
I must play. This is the week.
The horse told me so.

1049
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:21,960
You listen to me, scum bucket.
These are winning numbers.

1050
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,840
They're going to win today and
you're going to sell me the ticket.

1051
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,160
Right now!

1052
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:28,960
No ID, no ticket.

1053
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:34,960
Next.

1054
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,480
Hi, Ernie.

1055
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,680
Why isn't she in school?

1056
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,160
She tried to buy a lottery ticket
at the liquor store.

1057
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,800
That didn't work, so she came to me.
Asked me to do it for her.

1058
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,440
Did you buy her
the ticket, Ernie?

1059
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:52,000
Considering how she looked I thought
I'd better bring her home first.

1060
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,960
See what you wanted me to do.
Thank you for that.

1061
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:56,960
Call me if you need me, Millie.

1062
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,160
I'll call you if I need you.

1063
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:04,200
Maine!

1064
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:07,760
You said I had to know the day!
The horse's spirit entered me

1065
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:12,080
and today was the day I was supposed
to win 24 million dollars!

1066
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:13,560
Honey, that is crazy.

1067
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:17,040
I'm not crazy!
Why don't you believe me?

1068
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:18,600
Honey.

1069
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,000
Okay, okay baby.
Come on, sit down.

1070
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:23,440
Why don't you believe me?
Sit down, sit down.

1071
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:28,240
Now listen to me. It's not
about me believing you. It isn't.

1072
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,640
It's about where you put
your dreams, honey.

1073
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:36,080
I'm not asking you to be normal
cause that's not the Mirabeau way.

1074
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:40,120
I'm just asking you get a little
smarter about your crazy side, okay?

1075
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,760
Okay. Yeah?

1076
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:46,840
That's my baby.

1077
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:48,920
Good girl.

1078
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,920
Hi, do you have a book on hold
for Mirabeau?

1079
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,040
You know, he's here right now.

1080
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,120
The author.
He's giving a reading.

1081
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,360
I'm going to the market, girls.

1082
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:28,520
Maine!

1083
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,320
No more trips to liquor stores

1084
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:34,120
dressed up like a harlot.
You understand me?

1085
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,200
I'll keep an eye on her.

1086
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,160
Okay.

1087
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:58,680
"Carolina stood up naked out of
the tub and asked for a towel.

1088
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,520
Looking at the floor,
he had one open,

1089
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:05,240
and as she moved into it,
her forehead came to rest

1090
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,280
on his right shoulder.

1091
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:10,320
Water from her hair
stained his shirt

1092
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,840
and chilled his skin.

1093
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,080
Her face was now so close to his

1094
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:18,240
that she looked distorted
and it came as a terrible surprise

1095
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:22,160
that he loved her even more
at this proximity.

1096
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:28,120
He realized that to her, he would
never be more than a close friend."

1097
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:29,360
Hello?

1098
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:32,440
Maine? Not now, I'm busy.

1099
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:38,000
Maine, stop crying, baby.

1100
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:47,280
Let me talk to the police.

1101
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:04,360
Excuse me, I'm Carolina Mirabeau.

1102
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,400
I was brought here...
I was told that

1103
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,320
my grandmother died
in a car accident.

1104
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,400
Mirabeau.

1105
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:56,400
Have a nice day.

1106
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,120
Next.
Hi. I'm here to pick up

1107
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:03,280
my grandmother's things from
her car. It's the red Chevelle.

1108
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:06,960
Millicent Mirabeau was her name.
Here's my ID.

1109
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,640
That'll be 128 dollars.

1110
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,480
What?
128 dollars.

1111
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:15,800
Tow, tax, storage, release.

1112
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:18,760
Fine. Okay. Here.

1113
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:24,160
Don't take credit.
Don't take checks. Cash only.

1114
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:29,680
All right, I'll bring cash tomorrow.
Just give me her things, please.

1115
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,480
I can't do that.

1116
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:38,240
All I want is her stuff.
She was killed yesterday.

1117
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:42,760
Well, I'm sorry for your loss,
but I'm running a business here.

1118
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:47,200
This is not about your business.
This is about someone's life.

1119
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,920
Give me that!
No.

1120
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:50,200
Bastard!

1121
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:54,160
This is not! How dare you?
Those are my grandmother's things!

1122
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:55,680
Give that to me!

1123
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,200
Jesus!

1124
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,200
Those are my grandmother's things!
Those are not yours, they're mine!

1125
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:17,320
I never got to say goodbye.

1126
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:23,280
Thank you.

1127
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:50,920
Your daddy wasn't always a drunk.
He took good care of you girls.

1128
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:54,600
Right up until the time
that your momma passed.

1129
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:59,320
I know all that, Aunt Marilyn. She
died and then he started drinking.

1130
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:04,680
Yeah. But baby,
it's the part before that

1131
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,520
that nobody ever told you about.

1132
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:13,120
Mainly because, well,
grandma told me that she'd

1133
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:17,360
toss me into a vat
of chicken manure if I did.

1134
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,960
Your grandma saved your life.

1135
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:25,040
What?

1136
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:30,120
Well, you see,
your momma had rich parents.

1137
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:33,640
When they learned that
your momma got knocked up,

1138
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,080
they took her straight
to the abortion clinic.

1139
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,080
See, your grandma
had a different view.

1140
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:50,040
She marched into that place

1141
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,760
like a fiery-winged
banshee from hell.

1142
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,240
No that's my boy's baby in there,

1143
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,480
and it's gonna born if I have
to shoot every last one of you.

1144
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,360
Outside, missy.

1145
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:02,840
Now.

1146
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:23,720
Sure as shit's quiet around here
without her, ain't it?

1147
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:04,040
It's okay.

1148
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:06,840
And now for the lottery numbers.

1149
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:09,840
4.

1150
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,120
27.

1151
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:13,720
27.
7.

1152
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:15,320
7.

1153
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,400
16.

1154
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:18,920
16.

1155
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:20,040
9.

1156
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:20,800
9.

1157
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:21,440
26.

1158
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:24,640
And "26".

1159
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,000
Good luck everyone.
It's a big one.

1160
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,960
"Hey, California".

1161
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:31,760
Tonight's jackpot is huge. I hope
you got your lucky picks here,

1162
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,640
cause here we go.

1163
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:35,920
Those were my numbers.

1164
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,560
"Dear Grandma Mirabeau. It's time to
come clean. I'm Daphne St. Claire."

1165
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:10,360
Yep, me.

1166
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:13,880
I didn't tell you at first because
your comments were so refreshing.

1167
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:17,280
I hope you like this book.
There's a lot of talking,

1168
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:20,320
but there's a lot of loving in it,
too.

1169
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:23,280
Take care of her for me.
Albert

1170
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:50,440
I have something for you.

1171
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,440
What is it?

1172
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,520
Open it and find out.

1173
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:01,480
Are those lottery tickets?

1174
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:05,520
They were in grandma's car.
In the glove compartment.

1175
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,320
She was playing my numbers?

1176
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:11,280
Yep. Every day.

1177
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:15,720
Well, did grandma play them
the day of the accident?

1178
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:17,800
The day that Maine's numbers won?

1179
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:23,600
No.

1180
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:29,760
Then it was my fault. She was going
to the store to play my numbers.

1181
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:31,960
It was not your fault, Maine.

1182
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:35,160
It was the drunk driver
who ran the red light's fault.

1183
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:38,520
She believed in you.
That's why she played your numbers.

1184
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,480
Are you sad that you didn't
win the money?

1185
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:47,200
No.

1186
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:52,520
It probably would have ruined my
life. Money does that, you know.

1187
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:56,080
What's important is
that I was right.

1188
01:23:56,240 --> 01:24:00,280
And I'm not going crazy because
I was right about my numbers.

1189
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:22,240
Hello, this is Albert.

1190
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,120
I'm out of town on a book tour.
Please leave a message.

1191
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,200
Albert.

1192
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:37,840
Grandma died.

1193
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,160
Save, save, save.

1194
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:22,200
Where are your hookers?

1195
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:25,000
They're gonna be here soon.

1196
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:26,080
Why?

1197
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:30,960
I just read "Lady Chatterly's
Lover." I have some questions.

1198
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,120
You do, do you?

1199
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,040
Chang moved in last week.

1200
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,040
Come on, baby. Hey!

1201
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,760
You know who's playing?

1202
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:09,800
You know, I quit my job
at the "Perfect Date."

1203
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,000
Really?

1204
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:16,040
Do you have something else?

1205
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:21,200
Yeah, a new cable show. Making
documentaries, research and stuff.

1206
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:23,880
That's great. Congratulations,

1207
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:25,200
Carolina.

1208
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,720
Yeah, I like it.
I like it a lot.

1209
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:35,160
What are you doing here?

1210
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,800
Your grandma always
asked me here, and...

1211
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,880
Well, a little late,
but here I am.

1212
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:42,800
Okay.

1213
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:53,400
Okay. I think we're ready.

1214
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:56,880
Who'll carve the turkey?
I will.

1215
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,600
Who's gonna say grace?
Bow your heads.

1216
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:02,600
As grandma would say...

1217
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,760
Lord, bless this family.

1218
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:08,720
Fill their bellies
and keep them safe and warm.

1219
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:12,080
Thank you for giving Georgia
and Chang a perfect baby.

1220
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:15,360
Crooked eyes and all.
Thank you

1221
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,760
for not making Maine too normal.

1222
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:22,880
Thank you for taking care
of grandma.

1223
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:27,520
She can make your life hell,
but nobody loved us better.

1224
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,160
And now, Lord...
Let's get personal.

1225
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:45,520
I've eaten Thanksgiving dinner in
this backyard for the last 3 years

1226
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,280
and I plan on doing it
for the next 50.
