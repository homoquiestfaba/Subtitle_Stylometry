I know it's hard to Annie, but
we both have to deal with it.

Yes, I'm being responsible ...

8

Someone has to take care of everything ...

9
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,100
And we are her children, for God's sake.

10
00:02:22,702 --> 00:02:24,501

Hi, you must be Nicoles little girl.
Its nice to meet you.

79
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,171
You never met?

80
00:16:49,172 --> 00:16:53,565
No, but I saw the thousand pictures

84
00:17:10,841 --> 00:17:15,379
But Annie, it's been 3 days.
You know how she is.

85
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,624
Probably couldn't handle all this

86
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,975
She will show up.

87
00:17:21,851 --> 00:17:25,410

you wanna get outa here? go to my moms place?

88
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:28,030
I do not want to be there alone.

89
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:31,825
Yes, I would love that.

90
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:46,315
Out like a light, I think that
time change really threw her for a loop.

91
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:55,790
I found these in my room.
I cant beleive i can actually smoke in here.

92
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,931
Since the time when I smoked.

93
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:11,017
It tastes like i'm 15.

94
00:18:11,018 --> 00:18:13,438
Lemme see that necklace.

95
00:18:16,272 --> 00:18:18,498
A cross? You?

96
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:22,077
Believe it or not, mom gave it me
when i was a kid.

97
00:18:22,078 --> 00:18:24,428
I love it.

98
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:34,694
Shit ...

99
00:18:35,132 --> 00:18:38,669
I cant even smoke in here.

100
00:18:39,365 --> 00:18:42,045
I have a feeling that
she is going to try and stop me.

101
00:18:42,046 --> 00:18:45,226
Was it really that horrible for you guys

102
00:18:45,227 --> 00:18:47,917
growing up with her?

103
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,494
You have no idea.

104
00:18:53,606 --> 00:18:55,664
Some people shouldnt have kids.

105
00:18:55,665 --> 00:18:57,675
You shouldnt say that

106
00:18:57,676 --> 00:19:02,090
There is a deep love
between mother and child.

107
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:04,781
I think it's a beautiful thing.

108
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:09,771
Is this the same deep love that made
Nicole take off on her kid?

109
00:19:10,972 --> 00:19:13,137
Annie! We dont know whats hapened to her.

We have seen this over and over again

112
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,687
This is what we do in my family.

113
00:19:21,688 --> 00:19:24,175
When things get tough, we take off.

114
00:19:24,176 --> 00:19:26,299
my dad did it wherever the hell he is,

115
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,686
and now Nicole is doing it.

116
00:19:27,687 --> 00:19:30,377
Then, why have you come back?

117

claiming what you claimed ...

146

We sent people to check
because you refused to go back ...

147
