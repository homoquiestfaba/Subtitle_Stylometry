How much they pay you
around here, Robert?

141

Pay me? Uh, $30 a week.

142
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:40,633
I run the marvel show out on

Uh, no, sir.

144
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:47,367
Ha. I guess that's my fault.

a way with publicity.

come out and work for me.

the traveling show.

157

158

For real as man's
capacity to dream.

stretched over a wood frame.

- Yeah, they're through

Where are they?

163
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:01,733
Well, I was trying to tell
you, with Matt gone that
I'd just decided...

164
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:05,067
Oh! I hate it when you
lock them up. It's not fair.

165
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,933
- Honey, you know I do it
for their own protection.
- I know.

166
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:12,733
Come on. They're down in the
workshop. I'll introduce you.
Locked up by this cruel man.

167
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:18,167
- You have something locked up?
- No, no, no. But go on, be
prepared for a big surprise.

168
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,867
Hi, Pinhead.
Oh, did you miss me?

169

you to Robert.

00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,633
Yeah, we call this
fellow Pinhead.

172
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:41,500
I mean upstairs it's all
just bunkin', but these
are the real marvels.

173
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:43,833
See that mean lookin' fellow
there, we call him Blade.

174
00:16:43,867 --> 00:16:45,333
- Don't shake his hand.
- (GRUMBLING)

175
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:47,667
- Fellow next to him is
called Six-Shooter.
-(GROANING)

176
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,967
- And that's Jester.
- (MOANS)

177
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:51,567
- And that lovely lady
is Leech Woman.
-(SIGHS)

178
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,633
- Why "Leech Woman"?
- Well, hope that you never
find out. (CHUCKLES)

179
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:59,167
And this is Tunneler, aptly
named. (SNICKERS)

180
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,067
There are no strings.

181
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,800
That's right, Robert.

182
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,633
Not on these puppets.

183
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,267
So, how do you like your room?

184
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,433
- Hmm? Oh, it's, uh...
It's fine. Thank you, sir.
- Good.

185
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:16,300
- Here you go.
- Thank you, miss.

186
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,833
You know you're gonna
have to start calling
me Jane sometime soon.

187
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:25,133
MAGREW:
For these blessings that
we are about to receive,

188
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,600
- Lord, truly make us thankful.
- Hmm?

189
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:30,933
Amen.

190
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:34,633
So, (CLEARING THROAT)

191
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:37,500
do they eat?

192
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,900
No, son. (CHUCKLES)

193
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,333
I don't understand.

194
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:48,667
I just don't understand
how puppets can live.

195
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:52,733
You know, Robert,
I don't understand
how anything be alive.

196
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:56,233
A man, a tree, a fish, but,

197
00:17:56,267 --> 00:18:01,367
you know, I guess when the
miracle is commonplace enough,
people just don't question it.

198
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,067
But, how do you make them?

199
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:07,367
Well, I have a confession
to make. I didn't make them,

200
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,533
- I bought them at an
auction years ago.
-(GROANING)

201
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:13,100
They came in an old trunk
and when I took them, well,

202
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,467
-they were the same
then as they are now.
-(SNICKERING)

203
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,800
See, I've tried to
duplicate that process,

204
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,400
but I've never been able
to make a living puppet.

205
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,700
I've come close. Heaven
knows I've come close.
(CHUCKLING)

206
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,500
I can't say I like the way
they're staring at me.

207
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:30,700
Oh, don't be fooled by
the way they look.

208
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:33,333
They're really gentle.

209
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:37,633
You know, Robert, when
I hired you, I needed
help with the show.

210
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:41,200
But I did have another
reason in mind.

211
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:42,733
This.

212
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,200
You see, I wanna
carve a living puppet
just like these.

213
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:51,700
And you have a special skill.

214
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:54,400
And I need you to
carve me a miracle.

215
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,800
Will you help me?

216
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,267
Yes, sir, I will. I'll help.

217
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:38,267
Clear away now. Clear away!

218
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:41,367
Hey, there.

219
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,300
Aren't you that big old boy
that works at the gas station?

220
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:50,300
Uh, yes, sir, I was.
I started working here.

221
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,567
How'd you get mixed up
with this old coot?

222
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:54,100
I'm sorry?

223
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:56,433
Heh. Skip it, skip it.

224
00:19:56,467 --> 00:19:57,967
Where's Magrew?

225
00:19:58,067 --> 00:20:01,933
Um, I'm not sure,
I think he may be in...

226
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,900
Don't you worry.
We'll find him.

227
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:08,433
We're not gonna get any
answers out of this dummy.

228
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,267
(CLAPPING)

229
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,633
Solid oak, guys, solid oak.
Pass it around.

00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:18,667

(CROWD APPLAUDING)

234
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:31,633
Fastest six guns in the West,
Six-Shooter.

235
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:33,467
Give him a hand,
ladies and gentlemen.

236
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,733
He's only a puppet,
but he loves applause.

237
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:36,967
(CROWD APPLAUDING)

238
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,600
Step right up,
ladies and gentlemen.

239
00:20:44,633 --> 00:20:47,500
One of the many marvels
of The House of Marvels.
Take a look at them.

240
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:52,433
- Ooh!
- Wow!

241
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:58,067
Take a look at them.
One of the many marvels
at The House of Marvels.

242
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,800
Go ahead, step right up.

243
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:06,600
Take a closer look
if you want.

244
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:13,967
Sheriff.

245
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:15,967
Someplace quiet.

246
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,067
You wanna take care of
things for a while?

247
00:21:22,067 --> 00:21:24,400
Why? What's wrong?

248
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:27,933
Oh, nothing wrong, darling.
We ain't here
to arrest nobody.

249
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:29,400
Oh, my.

250
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:31,500
What a nasty looking booger.

251
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:34,600
Well, I guess folks will pay
to see just about anything.

252
00:21:36,367 --> 00:21:37,367
(GUM SQUISHING)

253
00:21:54,367 --> 00:21:55,533
(FAINT GROWLING)

254
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:58,900
SHERIFF: So who all you got
living in this place?

255
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:03,133
Um, myself,

256
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:07,533
my daughter and the young boy
selling tickets in the booth.

257
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:09,067
He lives here?

258
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,100
Yeah, that's right.
That's my new assistant.

259
00:22:11,133 --> 00:22:12,733
What about the other boy?

260
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,833
What other boy?

261
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:17,933
What other boy do you think
I'm talking about?

262
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:20,800
Oh, Matt Dairy.

263
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:24,367
There you go. Looks like
you do all the time.

264
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,967
What about him?

265
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:28,067
Well, he left about
two weeks ago.

266
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:31,300
He told me his dad was sick
and that he was
going home to help out.

267
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,767
Do tell, do tell.

268
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,167
Well, it's funny,

269
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,233
on account of him
not having a pa,

270
00:22:37,267 --> 00:22:38,767
and his ma,
she's a bit worried.

271
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,067
Him not showing up or
calling or nothing.

272
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:42,500
Yeah, I know.

273
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:44,067
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.

274
00:22:44,067 --> 00:22:47,433
Oh, I guess that's because
Mrs. Dairy gave you a call
a couple of days ago.

275
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:51,067
Well, after she called you,
she gave me a call.

276
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:53,200
Yeah, that's right, I spoke
with her.

277
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:54,833
I told her what
I just told you.

278
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:58,800
It's obvious that Matt
must have lied to me
for some reason.

279
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:00,433
What reason would that be?

280
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,567
Honestly, Sheriff,
I don't know.

281
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,967
Honestly?

282
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:07,567
Well, heaven knows
we all like a little honesty.

283
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,133
Look, Sheriff, if you're
implying that I had
anything to do with...

284
00:23:10,167 --> 00:23:12,800
I'm not implying
one sweet little thing.

285
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,467
Just since your
former assistant seemed to

286
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,867
drop clean off
the face of the world,

287
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,700
and you being the
last living soul to see
him before the plunge,

288
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:22,133
I just felt it was my duty
to come and talk to you.

289
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,267
He told me he was leaving
because his dad was sick.

290
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,567
He packed his bags and he
went off to the bus station.

291
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,567
- On foot?
- That's right.

292
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,633
Didn't drive him?

293
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:36,300
How could I, Sheriff,
if he was on foot?

294
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,167
You trying to be funny,
Magrew?

295
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,067
Hardly.

296
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:43,833
I got a disappeared boy,
that's serious business.

297
00:23:43,867 --> 00:23:45,867
Look, I'm not trying
to make light of it.

298
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,900
I'm sorry,
I just can't help you.

299
00:23:48,933 --> 00:23:51,100
I don't know what
could have happened.

300
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,333
I see.

301
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,767
Bobby, take out your pad.

302
00:23:57,867 --> 00:24:01,133
Write this down.

303
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:04,667
Mr. Magrew don't know what
could have happened to
poor little Matt Dairy.

304
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,500
Well, since you're so sure,

305
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:09,767
I guess that pretty much
settles our business
here for now.

306
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,967
Sorry I couldn't be more help.

307
00:24:14,067 --> 00:24:15,300
Well, that makes three of us.

308
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:16,800
But don't you worry,

309
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:19,767
before you're done, you may
end up being real helpful.

310
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,400
I gotta think on it a bit.

311
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:26,967
Tell you though, if I come up
with something, I'll be sure
to stroll on back.

312
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,733
Anytime.

313
00:24:30,767 --> 00:24:33,700
Okay, it's a deal.

314
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,767
It's just terrible,
what happened to Matt.

315
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,067
It's so scary to think you
could just vanish,

316
00:24:59,067 --> 00:25:01,200
and no one will ever know
what happened to you.

317
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:06,067
-(GRUNTING)
- Oh, I'm sorry.
No, no, don't be upset.

318
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:08,833
You know, I'm sure he's fine.

319
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:12,067
I mean, he didn't have
any money, did he?

320
00:25:12,067 --> 00:25:15,433
Well, what reason would anyone
have for hurting him?

321
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:17,167
MAGREW:
Here are the raw materials.

322
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,667
Hard, fine grain.

323
00:25:19,633 --> 00:25:23,133
No knots, no flaws,
perfect wood.

324
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,167
I've never seen wood like it.

325
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,800
What is it?

326
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:30,900
Very exotic. Very expensive.

327
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:35,067
And here, here are
the tools you'll need.

328
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:38,567
Study them.
Learn what each one can do.

329
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,633
444 pieces.

330
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:50,367
Each piece must be
cut precisely to scale.

331
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,433
Like the inner gears
of a wooden clock,

332
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,933
there can be no flaws,
no mistakes,

333
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:57,200
in size, dimension or shape.

334
00:25:57,233 --> 00:26:01,100
Otherwise, the puppet cannot
be properly assembled.

335
00:26:01,133 --> 00:26:03,700
All this would be wasted.

336
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:05,767
What will it look like
when it's finished?

337
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,300
You'll learn that
in good time, son.

338
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:13,433
I don't understand,
I mean what's the secret?

339
00:26:13,467 --> 00:26:15,167
These are just pieces of wood.

340
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,467
No matter how
perfect I carve them,

341
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,600
they'll still just be
pieces of wood.

342
00:26:20,633 --> 00:26:24,967
How can putting them
together make them live?

343
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:28,067
You want to know the secret of
how to make a dead thing live?

344
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:32,067
You put your soul into it.

345
00:26:33,533 --> 00:26:36,233
You put everything you have
into this carving,

346
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,867
and you have my word,

347
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,300
it will live.

348
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:45,833
When do you think
you can begin?

349
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,267
Right now.

350
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:06,467
Have you seen his work?

351
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:11,133
Yeah, I've seen it.
I can't tell how good it is,
it's all in pieces.

352
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:13,800
This boy's
a real artist, yes, sir.

353
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:16,600
Better than Matt?

354
00:28:17,533 --> 00:28:19,333
Matt did carving for you too?

355
00:28:19,367 --> 00:28:21,400
Oh, yeah, he did work for us.

356
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:25,067
I'd show it to you, except
that he took it with him.

357
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:29,567
His work was good.
He was a natural.
But you're better.

358
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,667
His work had quality.
But yours?

359
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,567
Yours has perfection.

360
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,833
After all, that's what
we're striving for, isn't it?

361
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:40,933
Sir?

362
00:28:40,967 --> 00:28:42,900
Perfection.

363
00:28:42,933 --> 00:28:46,300
We're trying
to create perfection.

364
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,533
Take a look at
Blade over there.

365
00:28:48,567 --> 00:28:53,800
He never tires, never hungers,
knows no fear, tells no lies.

366
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:58,367
Feels no pain, has no secrets.

367
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,767
And what is man, except
at being at war with himself?

368
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:05,200
But not Blade, mmm-mmm.

369
00:29:05,233 --> 00:29:08,067
He has no hidden motives,
no secret self.

370
00:29:08,067 --> 00:29:10,667
He's purely and perfectly
what he is.

371
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,867
In fact, I think the world
would be a better place
if we were all like him.

372
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,767
But he doesn't talk.

373
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,133
Which only
supports my position.

374
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:20,533
Oh, let me shut myself up.

375
00:29:20,567 --> 00:29:23,067
All right, now go upstairs
and go to bed.

376
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:25,133
- No, no, I'm fine.
- No.

377
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,467

379
00:31:50,267 --> 00:31:52,067
Hey, how you doing?

380
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,967
The house is on fire.

381
00:31:56,733 --> 00:31:58,100
I'm naked.

382
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,367
I just think it's a lot.

383
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,300
- Robert!
- (GROANS)

384
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:03,567
Oh, I'm sorry.

385
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,167
No, no.
It's okay, it's all right.

386
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,467
I was just trying to
get your attention.

387
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,533
Just throw that in
the scrap pile, would you?

388
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:14,300
Robert, it's not broken.

389
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:16,900
Well, it's not perfect.
I can't use it.

390
00:32:16,933 --> 00:32:19,067
It's got blood all over it.

391
00:32:20,167 --> 00:32:22,067
What did you want?

392
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:25,933
Well, hell, I was coming down
to tell you that you
were working too hard.

393
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:29,400
I just ended up making
more work for you.
I was just being stupid.

394
00:32:29,433 --> 00:32:31,667
No, no, it's my fault.

395
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,267
Come on, let me
take a look at it.

396
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,567
- It's fine.
- Come on, just hold it steady.

397
00:32:40,633 --> 00:32:41,733
You have big hands.

398
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:44,333
It comes with the rest of me.

399
00:32:44,367 --> 00:32:46,900
You don't talk much, do you?

400
00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:49,233
Not that much to say, I guess.

401
00:32:50,233 --> 00:32:51,333
Well, where are you from?

402
00:32:52,367 --> 00:32:53,700
Who are your folks?

403
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:59,100
I come from Witherspoon.
Ain't got no folks.

404
00:33:00,567 --> 00:33:04,067
Come from the orphanage,
to the gas station, to here.

405
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:06,667
That's about all.

406
00:33:07,267 --> 00:33:09,233
Ain't been no place,

407
00:33:09,267 --> 00:33:12,233
got no brains for school
or nothing like that.

408
00:33:12,267 --> 00:33:17,200
Oh, come one.
Brains are the most
overrated organ that there is.

409
00:33:17,233 --> 00:33:21,967
You know, college is full
of kids with brains who will
never amount to anything.

410
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:26,067
They'll never be worth a damn.

411
00:33:26,067 --> 00:33:28,267
You know, Robert,
there's a way of being smart

412
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,100
that doesn't have anything
to do with brains.

413
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:33,367
Like you.

414
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,100
You've got woodsman
in your hands.

415
00:33:38,567 --> 00:33:41,767
Don't you understand?

416
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:46,567
Your hands can do things
that people with brains
only dream of.

417
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:55,067
You know, you've been here
almost a month and you haven't
called me by my first name.

418
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,133
I'm sorry.

419
00:33:58,167 --> 00:34:02,333
Don't be sorry, just say it.

420
00:34:04,533 --> 00:34:06,200
Jane.

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

422
00:34:54,433 --> 00:34:58,767
You know, I really need
to get back to my room.

423
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,267
I don't want to fall asleep
in here and have my daddy
walk in on us in the morning.

424
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,133
Somehow, I don't think
he'd understand.

425
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:07,600
I understand.

426
00:35:08,767 --> 00:35:11,067

- What? What's wrong?

00:35:20,233 --> 00:35:21,600
Ahhh!

(SIGHS)

432
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:54,100
Well, I'm going to
take advantage of a luxury.

433
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:56,367
I'm going to read
the Sunday paper.

434
00:36:03,467 --> 00:36:05,467
I had a dream
about you last night.

435
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,867
I was still in college,

436
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,800
and you were my teacher,
or I was yours, I don't know,
it was kind of confusing.

437
00:36:19,733 --> 00:36:22,467
I liked the way you
kissed me the other day.

438
00:36:24,467 --> 00:36:25,767
I've, um...

439
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:29,800
I've got to get back to work.

440
00:36:38,067 --> 00:36:39,300
Hey, Robert.

441
00:36:39,933 --> 00:36:41,200
Yeah?

442
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:43,667
I've got to go run
an errand in Tunning.
You want to go with me?

443
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,833
Sure, okay.

444
00:36:56,267 --> 00:36:59,900
JANE: You need some sunlight,
boy, you're pale as a ghost.

445
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:02,267
So what do we
have to get in Tunning?

446
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,533
Nothing.

447
00:37:04,233 --> 00:37:05,367
I'm sorry?

448
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,633
Oh, nothing at all.

449
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:10,300
Well, I don't have
anything to do all day.

450
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:13,900
I, uh, well... I lied to you.

451
00:37:13,933 --> 00:37:15,633
Well, I thought that you
might need a little break,

452
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:20,067
and since I knew you wouldn't
take one voluntarily,
I decided to force you.

453
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,867
Yeah, I kind of thought
you'd like to go driving.

454
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,067
- Do you?
- I like it.

455
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,367
You know, I thought we could
go spend some time
there by the lake.

456
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,800
Just hang out for a while.

457
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,700
I'd like that too.

458
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:40,600
JANE: You know, I wanted
to show you something.

459
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:44,133
Well, I've never shown it
to anyone else before.

460
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:47,200
- What is it?
- It's a secret.

461
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:49,233
Wait a second, it's, um...

462
00:37:50,433 --> 00:37:52,867
Oh, down though here.

463
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,167
You know, I used to come
here when I was a little girl,

464
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,700
and I was playing around
one day and I found this
clearing in the woods,

465
00:38:00,633 --> 00:38:03,367
and it was so beautiful.

466
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,633
It was like a scene out of
a fairy tale, or something,

467
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:09,367
and I used to come here
to be by myself.

468
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,667
Never told anyone else
about it, not even my dad.

469
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,067
I don't know if anyone else
even knows that it's here.

470
00:38:17,733 --> 00:38:21,633
I want to show you.
Come on, I'll take you there.

471
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:24,067
I haven't been here
since I went away to...

472
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:30,067
Someone must've buried
garbage over here.

473
00:38:31,633 --> 00:38:33,267
Dogs dug it up.

474
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:35,967
Oh, why did they
have to go and do that?

475
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,433
Looks like they were
burning something.

476
00:38:42,467 --> 00:38:44,467
Just leave it alone, will you?

477
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,500
Look at this, it's a...

478
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,567
Jane?

479
00:39:01,533 --> 00:39:04,867
Well, well, well,
look what we have here.

480
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,967
You on your way to grandma's
house, little girl?

481
00:39:07,067 --> 00:39:08,500
- Out of my way.
- Hey, hey, hey.

482
00:39:08,533 --> 00:39:10,400
Cut it out.
What's your problem, anyway?

483
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,067
You know what?
You're my problem.

484
00:39:13,067 --> 00:39:14,900
And people like you!

485
00:39:14,933 --> 00:39:18,200
They're can't be anything
good in this world without
you destroying it.

486
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:21,400
Whoa, what's this?
Where's this coming from?

487
00:39:21,433 --> 00:39:23,233
You know you have
a real problem, little girl,

488
00:39:23,267 --> 00:39:25,967
'cause I'm being
perfectly nice.

489
00:39:26,067 --> 00:39:28,167
I'm not raising my voice,
I'm not doing anything.

490
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,500
And you come out
with this stuff,
like I'm some kind of a...

491
00:39:30,533 --> 00:39:31,533
Incredible Hulk.

492
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,100
Like what?

493
00:39:35,133 --> 00:39:38,100
She said you were trying
to destroy the world,
and stuff.

494
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:40,200
Jesus Christ, what
a fucking retard.

495
00:39:40,233 --> 00:39:42,233
Hey, hey, hey,
I said cut it out!

496
00:39:42,267 --> 00:39:44,333
You're being very rude.

497
00:39:44,367 --> 00:39:47,133
'Cause I'm, like, trying
to have a conversation here.

498
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:50,067
- I don't want to have
a conversation with you.
- No?

499
00:39:50,067 --> 00:39:53,200
- Or anyone like you.
- Oh, what am I like?

500
00:39:53,233 --> 00:39:56,500
Hey, hey!
Again, you're pushing me.

501
00:39:56,533 --> 00:39:59,333
And what the hell's
your problem, anyway?
You like being pushed?

502
00:39:59,367 --> 00:40:02,167
- You like that?
- Get your hands off me!
Quit it!

503
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,633
(SPANKING) Whoo!

504
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:06,967
Ooh, you liked that,
didn't you?

505
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,800
Maybe you need
a good spanking.

506
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:11,433
You guys, please,
just leave me alone.

507
00:40:11,467 --> 00:40:14,367
Oh, well, being that
you asked so nice,

508
00:40:15,567 --> 00:40:16,567
no.

509
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:19,467
Jane, you okay?

510
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,267
Yeah, Robert, I'm fine.
Let's just go.

511
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,233
No, no, no.
I don't remember telling you
you could go anywhere.

512
00:40:24,267 --> 00:40:25,767
Come on, guys.

513
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,633
And I don't remember
saying anything to you, Tank.

514
00:40:28,667 --> 00:40:31,500
From how I'm looking at it,
this is none of your business.

515
00:40:31,533 --> 00:40:34,100
Anyone here think this
is any of Tank's business?

516
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:36,267
- I don't.
- Mmm-mmm.

517
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,333
- Nope.
- Guess it's unanimous.

518
00:40:39,367 --> 00:40:41,500
So, get the fuck out of here.

519
00:40:41,533 --> 00:40:45,333
Me and Little Red Riding Hood
are kind of on a little date.

520
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,967
Just leave her alone.

521
00:40:49,133 --> 00:40:51,767
What'd you say?
I couldn't hear.
What'd you say?

522
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:55,800
I said leave her alone.

523
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:57,700
Or what?
What are you gonna do?

524
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,133
Just leave.

525
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,600
Are you gonna punch me? Huh?
Yeah? You gonna kick me?

526
00:41:03,633 --> 00:41:06,633
Slap me to teach
me a lesson, huh?
You big fucking dummy.

527
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:08,500
Robert!

528
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:13,200
Oh, what was he?
Your knight in shining armor?

529
00:41:13,233 --> 00:41:15,067
Beep, beep. Yeah!

530
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:17,933
Hey, Tank, what do you say

531
00:41:17,967 --> 00:41:21,467
me and Little Red Riding Hood
give you a lesson
in adult education?

532
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,967
This is all an act, isn't it?

533
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:26,500
The more they struggle,
that means they want you
to be their man.

534
00:41:26,533 --> 00:41:29,067
- Show 'em who's boss.
- Fuck you!

535
00:41:29,067 --> 00:41:30,967
Jesus Christ, what language.

536
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,200
Get the fuck off me.

537
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,800
- Robert.
- Billy, get him off!

538
00:41:45,367 --> 00:41:46,667
Robert!

539
00:41:56,833 --> 00:41:58,233
Jesus, you okay?

540
00:41:59,233 --> 00:42:02,133
(GASPING) Yeah, I'm fine.
Come on.

541
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,633
It's all right.
Let's go, I'll drive.

542
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,567
You didn't do anything wrong.
Robert, if it weren't
for you...

543
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,333
But you don't understand.

544
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:48,967
When I had him up against
the car, it didn't have
anything to do with you.

545
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,333
It didn't even really have
anything to do with him.

546
00:42:52,267 --> 00:42:56,333
I just lost control.

547
00:42:56,367 --> 00:43:00,767
It was like I was strangling
everything that ever wronged
me since I was born.

548
00:43:02,433 --> 00:43:05,933
- I could've killed him.
- Small loss, if you ask me.

549
00:43:05,967 --> 00:43:10,400
But I could've
killed somebody!
I could have.

550
00:43:12,133 --> 00:43:16,733
- I was that close.
- Robert, you're a decent man.

551
00:43:16,767 --> 00:43:20,700
I know from experience
that there aren't a lot
of guys like you out there.

552
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:24,467
I hope you don't ever change.

553
00:43:26,067 --> 00:43:29,500
- I'm going to bed.
- Good night, dear.

554
00:43:38,067 --> 00:43:40,067
You wanna know
why you're unhappy, Robert?

555
00:43:41,467 --> 00:43:44,400
- Sir?
- You're at war with yourself.

556
00:43:44,433 --> 00:43:48,367
You do your best
on the outside to be
this meek, gentle boy.

557
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,500
But you're different
on the inside.

558
00:43:52,067 --> 00:43:54,133
Yes, sir, I guess I am.

559
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:58,300
There's another self inside.
A truer, more natural self.

560
00:43:58,333 --> 00:44:02,867
A creature of violence
with no fear,
with no conscience.

561
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:06,167
A killer.

562
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,200
You spend your whole life
battling the self
that lives inside.

563
00:44:10,233 --> 00:44:13,733
And what happened today,
though just for a moment,

564
00:44:15,067 --> 00:44:16,867
you lost that battle.

565
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,400
The real you,
the true you came out.

566
00:44:22,233 --> 00:44:26,600
No, sir.
I won't say you're wrong,

567
00:44:26,633 --> 00:44:30,967
but if it is true,
all I can say is

568
00:44:31,067 --> 00:44:33,467
I'd rather die than have
it come out again.

569
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,533
Hey, get the hell out of here!

570
00:45:52,567 --> 00:45:55,467
Keep it down, honey.
We don't want to wake
the house, do we?

571
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,700
(GROANING)

572
00:45:57,367 --> 00:45:58,400
What the hell?

573
00:46:22,133 --> 00:46:23,733
Go, go!

574
00:46:32,067 --> 00:46:33,500
Robert, get her in the house.

575
00:46:34,533 --> 00:46:36,067
Go on, get her in there now.

576
00:46:48,733 --> 00:46:52,733
He tried to save me,
that's why he's dead.

577
00:46:52,767 --> 00:46:56,100
- Come on inside.
- No, we can't
just leave him here.

578
00:46:56,133 --> 00:46:59,300
- No, I'll do it.
- Robert!

579
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:02,733
- We cannot just leave
him here in the dirt.
- We won't.

580
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,967
We won't. Now come on.

581
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,567
(GROANING)

582
00:47:22,633 --> 00:47:24,100
MAGREW: We have work to do.

583
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:01,100
You hold on, okay.
I'll make you whole again.
Just hold on.

584
00:49:11,067 --> 00:49:15,167
You want it, bitch?
What are you gonna do now?

585
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:20,633
You don't have your fucking
ape man and your fucking
puppets now, do you?

586
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:26,100
What are you gonna do?
Yeah, you better get out
of my fucking face.

587
00:49:56,133 --> 00:49:59,633
(PUPPETS GROANING)

588
00:50:14,167 --> 00:50:16,467
That's right. Do it, bitch!

589
00:50:17,067 --> 00:50:18,867
I said, do it.

590
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,433
Yeah, that's right.
Oh, yeah, you like that,
don't you?

591
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,500
(SCREAMING)

592
00:52:03,233 --> 00:52:04,633
Somebody came to see you.

593
00:52:06,233 --> 00:52:08,933
Pinhead? Pinhead!

594
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:13,867
Is he all right?
Are you really all right?

595
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:18,067
Yeah, he's all right.
Actually better than before.

596
00:52:18,067 --> 00:52:20,333
His parts were
a bit worn, so...

597
00:52:21,767 --> 00:52:26,267
That was so brave of you.
You are my hero,
do you know that?

598
00:52:28,467 --> 00:52:31,067
- Oh, Robert, I...
- No, no.

599
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,433
I'm just glad he's all right.

600
00:52:35,067 --> 00:52:38,067
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Robert, wait.

601
00:52:41,433 --> 00:52:43,100
I'm glad you're
not angry anymore.

602
00:52:46,067 --> 00:52:47,867
Robert, I was angry with you.

603
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:50,800
But I had no right to be.

604
00:52:53,133 --> 00:52:55,733
I wanted that boy to suffer.

605
00:52:55,767 --> 00:52:58,367
I wanted you
to make that boy suffer.

606
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:03,067
I should've just let you
finish him on the path.

607
00:53:03,067 --> 00:53:04,933
- Maybe I should have.
- No!

608
00:53:06,333 --> 00:53:09,833
You were right
and I was wrong.

609
00:53:10,933 --> 00:53:14,433
Any fool in this world
can be a destroyer.

610
00:53:14,467 --> 00:53:17,200
Only a very few
can be creators.

611
00:53:18,333 --> 00:53:21,600
Don't trade one for the other.

612
00:53:21,633 --> 00:53:23,967
And don't let me
or anyone else make you.

613
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:44,433
You can stay if you want.

614
00:54:43,667 --> 00:54:45,967
- (KNOCKING AT DOOR)
- Yeah?

615
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:51,067
- Honey?
- Daddy, come on in.

616
00:54:57,633 --> 00:54:59,367
I just wanted to talk
to you about...

617
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:07,500
- Pinhead.
- Robert did it.

618
00:55:07,533 --> 00:55:11,067
He put him back together.
He brought him back.

619
00:55:12,367 --> 00:55:15,200
- That's amazing.
- It's a miracle.

620
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:18,567
His hands can do miracles.

621
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,533
You really think
a great deal of him,
don't you, honey?

622
00:55:24,367 --> 00:55:25,500
Daddy,

623
00:55:27,067 --> 00:55:28,067
I love him.

624
00:55:29,067 --> 00:55:30,167
I see.

625
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,933
You know, I'm not
a little girl anymore.

626
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:40,067
No, I know, honey.

627
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,900
I just don't want to see
you get hurt, that's all.

628
00:55:42,933 --> 00:55:45,733
Do you really think
that Robert would hurt me?

629
00:55:45,767 --> 00:55:49,067
No, I don't mean it that way.

630
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,567
It's just that sometimes
these things don't last.

631
00:55:52,967 --> 00:55:56,467
You see, you can give
your heart to somebody,

632
00:55:57,833 --> 00:56:00,067
and then they're
just not there.

633
00:56:00,067 --> 00:56:01,933
Are you talking about Mom?

634
00:56:01,967 --> 00:56:04,067
No, I'm not talking
about your mother.

635
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:07,200
Look, Daddy, I know
that anything can happen,

636
00:56:07,233 --> 00:56:09,400
that any of us
can be dead tomorrow.
I can't let that...

637
00:56:09,433 --> 00:56:10,867
I'm talking about Robert.

638
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,633
I'm talking about
a temporary situation.

639
00:56:13,667 --> 00:56:17,233
I'm talking about a situation
that can't go on indefinitely.
Don't you understand?

640
00:56:17,267 --> 00:56:20,400
No! Daddy, I...

641
00:56:20,433 --> 00:56:22,867
Don't you see?
Robert is almost
through with the puppet.

642
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,167
Well, what if he is?

643
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,167
I mean, that doesn't change
the way that we feel
about one another.

644
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,067
- What, are you gonna fire him?
- No, I wasn't going to do
anything like that.

645
00:56:32,067 --> 00:56:35,100
'Cause I want you to know
it doesn't make any difference
to me whether or not you do.

646
00:56:35,133 --> 00:56:37,067
With his talent
he can go anywhere.

647
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,967
Honey, please,
you're not listening to me.

648
00:56:41,067 --> 00:56:43,467
Well, then tell me,
what are you trying to say?

649
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,333
I'm trying to say...

650
00:56:46,367 --> 00:56:49,067
I'm trying to say
that you're young
and that he's young.

651
00:56:49,067 --> 00:56:51,200
And as you said,
anything can happen.

652
00:56:51,233 --> 00:56:53,167
I mean, if he were to leave...

653
00:56:54,067 --> 00:56:56,400
I'm just trying to say...

654
00:56:56,433 --> 00:56:58,767
I'm trying to say
I don't want you to be
too attached to him.

655
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,433
I don't want you to get
too attached to him.
I don't want you to get hurt.

656
00:57:04,067 --> 00:57:05,067
Oh, please.

657
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:08,133
Please understand.

658
00:57:08,167 --> 00:57:11,500
Everything I'm saying,
I'm saying for your own good.

659
00:57:15,433 --> 00:57:16,433
Good night.

660
00:57:25,633 --> 00:57:26,633
(WHISPERING)
Good night, honey.

661
00:57:36,633 --> 00:57:37,967
Hey, Robert, lunch break!

662
00:57:46,067 --> 00:57:47,367
Hey, you look pale as a ghost.

663
00:57:49,367 --> 00:57:50,367
Robert?

664
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,100
I'm almost there.

665
00:57:53,267 --> 00:57:54,267
What?

666
00:57:55,233 --> 00:57:56,400
I'm almost there.

667
00:57:56,767 --> 00:57:57,767
Daddy?

668
00:57:59,067 --> 00:58:01,233
Daddy, come out here!

669
00:58:01,267 --> 00:58:04,533
Yes, hi, Dr. Carroll. No, no,
I'm fine, thank you.

670
00:58:04,567 --> 00:58:07,867
I was calling about Robert.
He's been a bit
tired lately.

671
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,800
Feverish, delirious.

672
00:58:09,833 --> 00:58:11,067
He's quite ill.

673
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,967
It's all right, Robert.
It's all right. Just rest.

674
00:58:16,933 --> 00:58:18,133
Yes, thank you, Doctor.

675
00:58:19,267 --> 00:58:20,967
What did the doctor say?

676
00:58:21,067 --> 00:58:22,900
He's coming over.

677
00:58:22,933 --> 00:58:26,400
That would be great,
Dr. Carroll, thank you. I
certainly appreciate that.

678
00:58:30,467 --> 00:58:31,800
He said not to worry.

679
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:35,433
There's a bit of influenza
going around this summer.

680
00:58:35,467 --> 00:58:37,200
Lots of people have
come down with it.

681
00:58:37,233 --> 00:58:41,233
A big, strong boy like Robert,
he should have no problems
pulling through this at all.

682
00:58:41,967 --> 00:58:42,967
When's he coming?

683
00:58:43,667 --> 00:58:44,700
He'll be here this afternoon.

684
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,900
Don't you worry.

685
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:51,133
Oh, blast it. Oh, I forgot
all about it. It's Friday.

686
00:58:51,167 --> 00:58:52,667
What? What's wrong?

687
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:55,567
Well, Tommy Berke is
shipping us that mermaid
that we ordered.

688
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,200
- Mermaid?
- Yes, yes, yes, you remember.

689
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:59,633
I told you all about it.
The stuffed mermaid.

690
00:58:59,667 --> 00:59:02,267
It'll be at the Brewster
shipping office today.

691
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:03,467
Well...

692
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,900
Well, we got the show tomorrow
and the weekend's here...

693
00:59:08,233 --> 00:59:11,333
I think I should stay with
Robert until the doctor comes.

694
00:59:11,367 --> 00:59:13,367
- Well, I could...
- Could, you, honey?

695
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,900
I know it would mean that
you wouldn't be getting
back until late tonight.

696
00:59:15,933 --> 00:59:18,067
No, no, I mean,
I could, you know...

697
00:59:18,067 --> 00:59:21,767
I know. I know you want
to be here with Robert.

698
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,833
But just in case anything
should happen, and I don't
think anything will happen.

699
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,933
But just in case something
should happen, I think it

700
00:59:27,967 --> 00:59:29,467
would be better if
I were here with him.

701
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,700
Good. Good, you better hurry.

702
00:59:34,733 --> 00:59:37,567
Drive carefully, take
a sweater with you,
it'll be cold tonight.

703
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:42,967
Robert, you just rest.

704
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,067
I'll be back soon, all right?

705
00:59:47,533 --> 00:59:48,733
Daddy will take care of you.

708
01:00:46,533 --> 01:00:48,633
Doctor, boy's a bit ripe.

709
01:00:48,667 --> 01:00:51,733
Yeah, I figure three,
maybe four days.

710
01:00:51,767 --> 01:00:54,300
I'll know closer when
I get him on the slab.

711
01:00:54,333 --> 01:00:56,033
What's the quick and dirty?

712
01:00:56,067 --> 01:00:57,467
Well, you can take your pick.

713
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,733
Multiple lethal stab wounds.

714
01:00:59,767 --> 01:01:02,167
One hand ground nearly off.

715
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,367
His head peeled clear
back to the skull.

716
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:09,267
In case you're curious, that
was all done ante mortem,
that's before death.

717
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,333
Do tell.

718
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,400
So, all in all,

719
01:01:13,433 --> 01:01:15,833
I guess we can pretty
well rule out suicide.

720
01:01:20,133 --> 01:01:21,667
Well, well, well.

721
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:23,233

722
01:01:23,733 --> 01:01:25,300
You.

723
01:01:25,333 --> 01:01:26,633
What is it, Art Cooney?

724
01:01:26,667 --> 01:01:27,967
Yep.

725
01:01:28,067 --> 01:01:30,433
Let's take a
little stroll, Art.

726
01:01:30,467 --> 01:01:31,767
Just chat for a bit.

727
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:38,733
Now, Art, we know that
you and Joey are like
two balls in a sack.

728
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:40,867
When'd you see him last?

729
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:43,367
Hmm...

730
01:01:44,733 --> 01:01:46,633
You know, I don't
rightly recall.

731
01:01:46,667 --> 01:01:47,667
You don't?

732
01:01:48,133 --> 01:01:49,633
Nope.

733
01:01:49,667 --> 01:01:52,067
When's the last time you
remember seeing him,
try it that way.

734
01:01:53,067 --> 01:01:54,067
All right, I'll try.

735
01:02:02,067 --> 01:02:04,933
Nope. I'm sorry, nothing
comes to mind.

736
01:02:04,967 --> 01:02:07,067
You don't say.

737
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,600
It all just sort of blurs
together, you know?

738
01:02:09,633 --> 01:02:12,367
I mean, sometimes I just can't
remember a single thing

739
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,867
about nothing.

740
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:17,467
Oh, that's really too bad.

741
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:21,067
Here. Tell you what, why
don't we try something?

742
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,167
Maybe help you out a bit.

743
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,067
Now, I want you... Well, here.

744
01:02:27,167 --> 01:02:28,967
I want you to look
at this refrigerator.

745
01:02:29,067 --> 01:02:31,100
Look at this dot right there.

746
01:02:31,133 --> 01:02:33,233
- Concentrate.
- All right.

- I'm lookin'.

- I'm looking right at it.

He got into a fight with Tank
down by the lake, all right?

755
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:53,467
Last time I saw him, he said
he was gonna pay him a visit.

756
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,967
He and that girl he was with.

757
01:02:55,067 --> 01:02:56,100

who runs that freak show
out on Lovejoy.

761

So, he said he was gonna
go over there and you
haven't seen him since?

762
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,833
I swear to God,
I haven't seen him, okay?

broke my nose.

yourself up inside.

I'm sorry,
there's still no answer.

850
01:09:21,567 --> 01:09:22,933
Well, could you...

851
01:09:22,967 --> 01:09:24,133
Never mind, thank you.

852
01:09:24,167 --> 01:09:26,067
You're welcome.

853
01:09:26,067 --> 01:09:29,433
Now I'm really worried.
I wonder if Daddy had to take
Robert to the hospital.

854
01:09:30,567 --> 01:09:31,800
Uh, I got him.

855
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:32,867
Who, my father?

856
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:34,867
No, Tommy Berke. Wait.

857
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:38,100
Yeah, want to talk to her?
Right. Hold on.

858
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,867
Hello, Mr. Berke?

Hey, there, Miss Magrew.

860
01:09:42,767 --> 01:09:44,533
Yeah, I was just
talking to this man...

BERKE:
I don't know nothing
about no mermaids.

862
01:09:46,533 --> 01:09:49,433
I ain't talk to your daddy
in around six months.

863
01:09:49,467 --> 01:09:51,733
I ain't had no mermaid
in almost a year!

864
01:09:51,767 --> 01:09:52,867
Well, are you sure?

865
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:54,433
Yeah, I am. I'm sure.

866
01:09:54,467 --> 01:09:56,333
Well, I just don't understand.

867
01:09:56,367 --> 01:09:59,133
I mean, my father
was very specific.

868
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:02,433
Why on earth would he send
me to pick up a shipment
he never ordered?

869
01:10:02,467 --> 01:10:04,600
I really couldn't say, now.

870
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:06,667
Yeah, yeah.
All right, all right,
thank you, Mr. Berke.
