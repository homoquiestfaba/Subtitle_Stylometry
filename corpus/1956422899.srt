1
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,973
Ha ha ha!

2
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,751
Ha ha ha!

3
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,331
Ah, ha ha ha!

4
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,727
Yee-ha ha ha ha ha!

5
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,713
Ha ha ha!

6
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,651
Ha ha ha ha ha!

7
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,287
Ha ha ha!

8
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,623
Ha ha ha!

9
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:45,330
Ha ha ha!

10
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:51,496
Ha ha ha!

11
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,048
Ha ha ha!

12
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:51,052
Wowee, that ball is...

13
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,531
out of here!

14
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,068
A grand slam!

15
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,200
Yeah!

16
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,241
Unbelievable!

17
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,902
In your face!

18
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:22,226
Yowza! Yowza! Yowza!

19
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,092
Show me something
to top that!

20
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,794
Did you see that?

21
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,081
Wow.

22
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,066
They're back.

23
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,166
Quick, give me the camera.

24
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:45,670
Oh, yeah.

25
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:48,304
Your mother's
never gonna believe this.

26
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,503
Greetings, Earthling.

27
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:17,542
Can you direct me to
the Roswell Chili Cookoff?

28
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:20,135
'Cause I'm a little low on gas!

29
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,507
Ha ha ha ha!

30
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,106
- Aah!
- Aah!

31
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,088
Ha ha ha!

32
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,198
Yaaa ha ha ha!

33
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,089
Wide load comin' through.

34
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,234
Run for your lives!

35
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,035
Ha ha ha ha!

36
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:53,579
Ha ha ha ha!

37
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,011
Ohh...

38
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,311
Ohhhh!

39
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,419
Get away from me!

40
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:07,324
Hey, batboy.

41
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,326
Strike one.

42
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,486
Strike two.

43
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,826
3, 4, 5, 6!

44
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,991
You're out!

45
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:21,035
It looks like your bat's
been to spring training.

46
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,073
Ha ha ha!

47
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,540
Aah!

48
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:29,082
Hey, ain't it time
for the seventh inning stretch?

49
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,274
Aaahhhh!

50
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:37,748
Aaahhh! Aah!

51
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:53,203
It's raining dogs and dogs.

52
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,967
Bombs away.
Ha ha ha!

53
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:10,111
Chill, folks.
You don't have to be scared.

54
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,590
See, I'm Casper, the Friendly...

55
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,593
- Ghost! - Ghost! -Ghost!

56
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,254
- Aah! - Aah! -Aah!

57
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,422
Ha ha ha ha!

58
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,557
Ha ha ha ha!

59
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,829
Boys,we done good.

60
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:26,462
I think it's time
we had a long rest.

61
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:29,337
Rest? You mean,
like "in peace"?

62
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,409
No!

63
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,808
In the Catskills.

64
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,937
Ooh, a vacation?

65
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,105
Certainly

66
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,446
Show me three ghosts
who deserve it more.

67
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,281
Uh, you mean four, right?

68
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:44,357
Oh, right, of course,
short-sheet.

69
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:45,686
Can't leave you out.

70
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,283
Otherwise, who'd
carry our luggage?

71
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:51,261
- Ha ha ha.
- Ha ha ha.

72
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,299
Ha ha ha, very funny.

73
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,993
You've reached the home

74
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,695
of Desmond Spellman.

75
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,773
Hi, I'm calling from
the International Children's Fund,

76
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,671
and we're asking
generous people like you

77
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:03,799
to donate any --

78
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,004
Aah! Ooh! Ooh!

79
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:20,453
Oracle of the Mirror,
show yourself.

80
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,722
You summoned?
Ha ha ha!

81
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,320
Don't take that tone with me.

82
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,195
You're a slave of the mirror,

83
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,859
and the mirror belongs

84
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,493
to the greatest witch of all --

85
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:31,502
Moi.

86
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,901
Yes, Master

87
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:33,904
Command me as you will.

88
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:34,905
Very well.

89
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,975
Give me the stock quotes,

90
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,407
the, uh, weather,

91
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,172
and the witch rankings.

92
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,212
Here is your news.

93
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,645
The skies are blue,

94
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,716
the Dow Industrials
are up by two,

95
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:47,479
you've been the greatest
for year after year,

96
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,748
but as of today

97
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,686
you have something to fear.

98
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,723
Haha!

99
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,019
What?

100
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:57,995
Who could be greater
than Desmond Spellman?

101
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,395
Wendy --Ooh--
the good little witch.

102
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:01,728
Good witch?

103
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,602
There's no such animal.

104
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,937
It is true, all the same,
on this you can bank.

105
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,771
Unless you act now,

106
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,572
you will forfeit your rank.

107
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,705
She's just a little child.

108
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,046
What's so dangerous about her?

109
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:20,778
Humble, yes, but in exile,
she'll change,

110
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,217
thanks to the help

111
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,086
of an ally most strange.

112
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:28,422
If witches and spirits
unite as friends,

113
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:32,020
she will be the greatest,
and your power will end.

114
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,031
Don't try to scare me,

115
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,397
you cheap antique.

116
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,630
Just, uh...

117
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:43,198
tell me how to get rid
of this little mall rat.

118
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,438
There's no adios
to compare with this --

119
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:47,569
behold!

120
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,479
The dreaded Mystic Abyss.

121
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,312
Human or witch
or creature not mortal,

122
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,581
all will be lost when
they step through this portal

123
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:56,587
Hahaha!

124
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:57,520
Perfect.

125
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,572
Ahhh...

126
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:23,810
Ah.

127
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,750
Ahhh.

128
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:03,612
Hey, you're lookin' good, Jules.

129
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,054
Back at ya.

130
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:10,558
I want you to go
to this address

131
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,529
and bring me this brat.

132
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,225
She's living in the country
with her aunts.

133
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:16,961
Ah, must bean aunt farm.

134
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:17,900
Ha ha ha!

135
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,708
I don't want any slip ups.

136
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,470
You think you can handle this?

137
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,988
No sweat.

138
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,227
Mornings would be better

139
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,195
if they happened
in the afternoon.

140
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,527
Oh,yeah.

141
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,964
He's coming.

142
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,642
Where did I put it?

143
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,810
Ch, right.

144
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:42,979
Thanks.

145
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,453
Yes.

146
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,065
Yikes, my pajamas!

147
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,417
Uh, Wendy's outside.

148
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,619
Don't bother me now.
Just keep watching.

149
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:22,660
OK, OK.

150
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,490
I'm the original Spice Girl.

151
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,691
Did you put in
enough belladonna?

152
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,166
Speaking of belladonna,
I once knew one.

153
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,793
A Donna, that is.

154
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,667
She had two kids,

155
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,331
so I guess that makes her
a "Ma, Donna." You get it?

156
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,374
Madonna?

157
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,876
Ooh, all right,
I'll shut up.

158
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,139
Fanny, status report.

159
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:43,181
Shh! I'm looking
for the paperboy.

160
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,943
Well?

161
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:47,547
Well what?

162
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:48,984
Is he coming?

163
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,147
Who?

164
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,850
The paperboy!

165
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,657
Good idea. Gert, I'm gonna
go look for him right now.

166
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,857
Ohh, God!
What did I do

167
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,330
to deserve sisters like this?

168
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:02,730
Well, let's see.

169
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,532
You invented mildew,
morning breath...

170
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,128
foot fungus.

171
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,104
Ha ha ha.

172
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,081
Hi.

173
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,205
Hi.

174
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:20,183
Ahoy, the paperboy.

175
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,776
OK, let's get going.

176
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,815
Thanks.

177
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:34,591
Oh! Hee hee hee!

178
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,973
Aah!Aaaaahhhh!

179
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,682
Aah! Stop it, stop it!

180
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,586
Help me! Aaahhhh!

181
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,782
Aaahhhh!

182
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,259
Hey, how do you like
them rotten apples?

183
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,862
Aah! Go away!

184
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:16,206
Now, that's "Hard Copy."

185
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,941
Weirdos.
You’re all weirdos.

186
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,913
How could you do that?!

187
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,953
No wonder I don't have any friends.

188
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,453
Oh, really?

189
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,752
Well, I don't like the way
he flings our paper.

190
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,121
Then just tell him.

191
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,388
Please, talk to the hand,

192
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,894
because the witches
ain't listening.

193
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:38,896
But --

194
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:39,931
Wendy-poo,

195
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,898
wake up and smell the potion.

196
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,901
I mean, we're witches,
 for goodness'' sake.

197
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,904
We don't explain.
We get even.

198
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,134
You mean, like this?

199
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,811
Little smarty-bloomers, eh?

200
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,847
Makes you love me
all the more, huh?

201
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,678
We don’t have to love ya.

202
00:16:58,784 --> 00:16:59,842
We’re family.

203
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,113
Yeah,we're stuck with ya.

204
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,689
[Vincent]
Not to worry, ladies.

205
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,848
We’re gonna take her
off your hands.

206
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,586
Butt out, Bozo,
before I turn you into a newt.

207
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:12,688
Aww, and here I thought
Desmond Spellman

208
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,699
told me that you was
gonna be so cooperative.

209
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:16,996
Ohhh...

210
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:18,365
D-D-D--

211
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,167
De-Desmond Spellman?

212
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,071
Do I look like
a speech therapist to you?

213
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,269
Then why are you stammering?

214
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,504
Leave her alone,you big goon!

215
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,981
Ahh! I'll take
Mouthy Little Witches

216
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,016
for 500.

217
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,211
And you hit the Daily Double.

218
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,219
- Aah!
- Ohh!

219
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:55,740
Yaaah!

220
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,969
- Aah! - Aah! -Aah!

221
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,545
Aaahhh!

222
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,076
Aah!Aah!

223
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:17,394
Ohh, now, run, come on!
Hurry up!

224
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,930
We got ya now, kid.

225
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:21,799
Oh!

226
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,067
Gosh,where are my manners?

227
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,806
Let me make you feel
right at home.

228
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,380
Of all the witches
in the world,

229
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,280
we had to get one
with a sense of humor.

230
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:39,282
Hurry up!

231
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,018
Uh-oh. Someone's
been working out.

232
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,647
Get your things and let's go.

233
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:46,723
Let's go.

234
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:47,690
Get your broom.

235
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,626
Hey you, come back here!

236
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:56,190
Oh, yeah, let's not
and say we did.

237
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,360
I almost got her.

238
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,036
Whew!

239
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,908
Well, I got us out
of that one, girls.

240
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:07,945
You?!

241
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,140
Why are those guys after Wendy?

242
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,081
Ask her.

243
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,879
I don't even know who they are.

244
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,044
You heard them.

245
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,088
They were sent by
Desmond Spellman.

246
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,816
Who's he?

247
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,255
He's trouble,

248
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,418
and you got us into it.

249
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,259
Yeah, Wendy
and it's all your fault.

250
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,832
Thanks a heap.

251
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,997
Wow, check it out.

252
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,303
Man, this place has everything

253
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,104
but my reservation.

254
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:43,671
Ahhh, I feel my ectoplasm
relaxin' already.

255
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:47,343
This is gonna be some vacation.

256
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,021
They must've thought
I was a pack mule

257
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,684
in another life.

258
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,693
Quit dawdling, Bulb Head.

259
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,640
Oh, Honeycakes,
this is gonna be

260
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:12,210
just so ab-fab.

261
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,643
Only the best
for the Bradshaws.

262
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:15,872
Ohhh.

263
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:19,110
Hey, this cabin looks nice.

264
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,350
Yeah, and it's empty, too.

265
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:23,546
Ohh.

266
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,350
Hey, knock it off, you guys.

267
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:26,947
There's already someone here.

268
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,151
Where?

269
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,127
I don't see anyone.

270
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,459
Do you?

271
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,133
- Aah!
- Aah!

272
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,725
- Aah!
- Aah!

273
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,032
Thanks for your hospitality.

274
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:44,131
See ya!

275
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,711
Ha ha ha!

276
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,142
- Ghosts!
- Ghosts!

277
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,305
Hahaha!

278
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,406
Boy, I can't believe you guys.

279
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:55,009
Do you have something
to share, young Casper?

280
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,214
Pray, do tell us.

281
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,586
I just thought m-maybe
you could -- Heh --

282
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,056
try to be a little more...

283
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:01,990
you know, friendly.

284
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,085
Good advice, Casper.

285
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,665
I thinkl speak for all of us

286
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,994
when I say...

287
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,159
drop dead!

288
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,567
The only good fleshie

289
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,833
is a scared fleshie.

290
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,408
But why do you scare them?

291
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,272
'Cause they can't scare back.

292
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,675
Except for witches.

293
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,077
Oohhhh!

294
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:24,512
What's wrong with witches?

295
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,516
Wake up and smell the coffin.

296
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,882
Witches are fleshies with power.

297
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:29,852
Yeah.

298
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:30,945
Oooh.

299
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:34,026
Now go unpack the stuff,
Washcloth.

300
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,355
Jeez Louise.

301
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,428
Whata bunch of grumps.

302
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,232
Ahhh, this is the afterlife.

303
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:45,730
Witches!

304
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,828
- Aah! - Aah! -Aah!

305
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,269
Hello, everybody,
I'm Larry Tollby.

306
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:55,779
I'm the social director
here at Sunny Brite.

307
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:56,746
How ya doin'?

308
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,111
OK, great.

309
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:00,207
Hey, did you hear the one
about the roof?

310
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,150
It's over your head.

311
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:02,778
Hey, look out, Robin Hood.

312
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,788
Archery 2:00.

313
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,560
Were we followed?

314
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,992
No, I think we're safe.

315
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,121
Are you sure this is
a good place to hide?

316
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,598
Desmond will never
find us in this place.

317
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,430
Oh, ladies.

318
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:18,435
Larry the Legend.

319
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:19,971
No, thank you.

320
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,268
Do you see?
This place, this dump

321
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,172
is disgustingly cheery.

322
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,438
I mean, we're miles
from nowhere.

323
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:29,310
We're definitely
all gonna blend in.

324
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:30,506
Yeah.

325
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,480
Aren't you ladies a little old

326
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:36,486
to be Trick-or-Treating?

327
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,283
Excuse me?

328
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:39,524
If it weren't for those hats,

329
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,649
you'd be totally pointless.

330
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:44,361
Ibbity...

331
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:45,430
Bibbity...

332
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,497
Fibbity--

333
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,828
Stop!
We're in hiding, remember?

334
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:49,867
Ohh.

335
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:52,198
Witches.

336
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,931
Yo!

337
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,972
Hi, Sugar.
Cabin for four.

338
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,373
Maybe with a spare room

339
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,344
in case I want to
entertain some guests.

340
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,540
I'm very sorry, ladies,

341
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,480
but I just gave
my last cabin

342
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:06,574
to that woman.

343
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,489
What, you mean, you don't
have any more vagrancies--

344
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,184
I mean, vagran-vagran-
vacan-vancan --

345
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,782
You don't have
any rooms here?

346
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,886
Not unless that woman
decides to move out.

347
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:26,202
Aunt Gert, don't --
don't you dare.

348
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:42,317
I've haaad
a chaaange of mind

349
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:45,254
Good-bye.

350
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,357
We're not goatish.

351
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,433
Bellbag, uh...

352
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:56,558
Bellboy please.

353
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,602
The bags to the top of the stairs.

354
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,240
You know, girls,

355
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,830
I think that old bag was right.

356
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,434
We definitely don't blend in.

357
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:07,512
Huh.

358
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,011
Wardrobe change.

359
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:34,233
I be witchin'!

360
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,103
That out fit,

361
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,370
you stick out
like a sore thumb.

362
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,774
Let's get inside.

363
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,317
Hold up.

364
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:50,855
Wait, wait.

365
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:52,651
Hi, I'm Josh.

366
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:54,418
You've probably heard of me.

367
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:55,789
I'm Wendy.

368
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,384
When'd you get here?

369
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,487
About a week ago.

370
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:00,622
Do you like it?

371
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,325
Kinda boring.

372
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,266
Until now.

373
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,243
Now, listen, Niece.

374
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,943
Desmond Spellman
is after you.

375
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:22,418
For some reason,
we're caught up in this.

376
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,080
Now, I don't want you
talking to anybody

377
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,317
until we figure out
how to get out of this jam.

378
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:27,482
Mmm.

379
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:28,525
Jam.

380
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:29,992
Mmm.

381
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:32,325
But why are we running
from this Desmond guy?

382
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,194
Why don't we just
all go confront him?

383
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:37,291
Better to confront
a nuclear missile.

384
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:38,494
Now, listen, missy.

385
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:41,698
This guy is trouble,
and he's after us.

386
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:43,501
No, Mirror Boy

387
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:46,543
I'm not going to let
some teen spell slinger

388
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,511
upstage me.

389
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,716
Tell me again
about the hash part.

390
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:54,444
It's minced corned beef
and potatoes.

391
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,544
You mix'em together, see?

392
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:58,953
And then you cook it
till it's nice --

393
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,684
Where have you been?

394
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,021
Uh, well, this diner

395
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,528
had a breakfast special,
see, and --

396
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,899
Where is Wendy?

397
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,838
Uh,she gave us the slip.

398
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,034
Great.

399
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,703
I'm going to have to go to plan "B."

400
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:32,646
Whoa.

401
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,350
Observe.

402
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:37,053
Now, if those witless witches

403
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:39,187
use any high-level magic,

404
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,994
this little gizmo
will pinpoint their location.

405
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,932
Now, watch.

406
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,901
What kind of potatoes?

407
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,371
Well, usually
you use the russets.

408
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,407
Watch!

409
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:12,558
Smells like something
died around here.

410
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:14,632
I thought you'd never notice.

411
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:15,791
Aah!

412
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,045
That wasn't very nice.

413
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,878
Thanks!

414
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,975
Now hold this

415
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,885
whilst I load you up
with delectables.

416
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,287
Great. Check out Casper,

417
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,087
the phantom food felon.

418
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:44,719
You want some cheese
with that whine?

419
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,662
Just clam up and carry
the food, Bulb Head.

420
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:52,468
Unh.

421
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,648
It's too dang cheery in here.

422
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:12,587
Yes, these floral prints
are just killing my sinuses.

423
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,422
Let's fix this place up.

424
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,461
You gonna help, little
Miss Goody-Two-Spells,

425
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,326
or you just gonna
type all day?

426
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,126
I know, you cast the spells,

427
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:23,291
and I'll run them through
my spell checker!

428
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,961
Ha ha. Get it?
Spell checker.

429
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:28,005
Hardy-har-har.

430
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:30,040
For your information,

431
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:33,133
I'm looking up Desmond Spellman
on the Internet.

432
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:36,509
Maybe, just maybe,
I can find some answers.

433
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:38,776
Well, check out
my new website.

434
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,248
Ooh, that's great!

435
00:28:42,587 --> 00:28:43,679
That's great!

436
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:45,950
So are we going
to redecorate or what?

437
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,554
All right. Witches one...

438
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:51,720
Witches all...

439
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,800
Zippity-zappity,
let's get that wall.

440
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,527
Good, good.
Now let's get that wall.

441
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,465
All right.
Now the back.

442
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,300
Excellent.
Wonderful.

443
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,536
Great.

444
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:08,408
Let's see, uh...

445
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,183
Check it out!

446
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,251
What?

447
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,851
Yes! It's them!

448
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,654
Quickly, write down
the coordinates.

449
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:26,694
Sorry.

450
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,425
Wait! Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop!

451
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,365
Hey! What?!

452
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:31,993
Stop it! Stop it!

453
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,093
Aah!

454
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:35,673
What? No!

455
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,675
No, no! Come back!

456
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,747
You...come...back!

457
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:47,046
Shh! All right.

458
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,745
I think we're safe.

459
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,116
Right. Not if you're
on the bottom.

460
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,212
Yeah, what's the big idea?

461
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,519
Big magic sends big static!

462
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,424
You mean Desmond
could have found us?

463
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,018
Faster than a Lo-Jack.

464
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,393
Now, from now on, we all
have to be very, very careful.

465
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:03,763
But I can't even tie
my own shoelaces without magic,

466
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,859
or do my algebra,
or-or brush my teeth,

467
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,062
or play the glockenspiel.

468
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:08,435
Relax, all right.

469
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,702
We can still do little stuff --
pranks, rashes --

470
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,140
we just can't do
the big stuff anymore.

471
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:13,233
Well, wait a minute.

472
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:14,903
If we have to quit,
so does she!

473
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:15,980
Hey!

474
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,707
Right, no more wand-y Wendy

475
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,942
Give it over, come on.

476
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:19,949
Cough it up.

477
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,143
Come on.

478
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:24,916
Fine. I'm wand-free.

479
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:27,583
This is much
too powerful for you.

480
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,285
Good. Now, I think
that we should go out

481
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:30,623
and do a little scouting,

482
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:32,059
in case Desmond
sent some of his spies.

483
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,597
We'll start at the pool.

484
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:34,563
OK.

485
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,599
The pool!

486
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,633
I'll get my swimsuit!

487
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:37,997
No way, Red.

488
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:39,570
You're not taking one step
outside this cabin.

489
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,639
Yeah! If Desmond finds you,

490
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,798
he'll turn us all
into pumpkin guts.

491
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:46,070
Yes, and don't trust anyone.

492
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,576
Man, I'm starting to feel
like I'm in

493
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,511
the Witches' Protection Program.

494
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,013
You got it, squirt.

495
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:52,742
Now stay!

496
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:23,212
Hey, Fatso! Stretch! Wake up.

497
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:24,645
We broughta snack.

498
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,808
Aah. Snack! I'm there.

499
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:29,114
Yeah, I'm starvin' to death...

500
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,052
in a manner of speaking.

501
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,647
Oh, yumbo!

502
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:35,658
It's delightful.

503
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,524
It's deluxe.

504
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,723
It's the last you'll see of it!

505
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,356
Uncle Fatso, what happened?

506
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,833
Yeah, you look like
a hot air balloon!

507
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:47,235
Huh? Aah! A sun burn!

508
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:48,635
Ehh, don't sweat it.

509
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,708
We'll bleach you out after lunch.

510
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,207
Now, let's eat.

511
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,642
Wait. No napkins.

512
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,613
Favorite Nephew,
will you dothe honors?

513
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,351
You scarfed everything.

514
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,586
No, no, no, no, no, no.

515
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:10,889
We left the wrappers.

516
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:13,020
You three always do this.

517
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,360
Do what?

518
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:15,728
Huh?

519
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,734
Ah, well...I mean, uh...

520
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:20,600
Nevermind.

521
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,508
Gee, I thinkwe hurt his feelings.

522
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:35,179
Man,whycan't I stand up
tothoseguys?

523
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:38,745
This vacation stinks.
It isn't fair.

524
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,651
It isn'tfair.

525
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:51,191
Yo, Josh, catch.

526
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,703
Hey, man, what's up?

527
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,364
Josh!

528
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,465
Josh! Hi there.

529
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:28,733
Too bad! You lose!

530
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,808
Crud! Thanks for messin' me up.

531
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:33,775
Oh, hi. Got a quarter?

532
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:34,845
Sorry.

533
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,744
No problem.

534
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,612
Hey, jerk.
This is my game!

535
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:39,649
Excuse me.

536
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,150
Quit it!

537
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,078
Hey, that wasn't very nice.

538
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,283
Watch me wipe out
these commanders!

539
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:49,156
Yeah, nuke'em, wax'em, fry'em!

540
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,284
Josh, uh...

541
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:53,092
I really needed
to talk to someone

542
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,130
and I thought --

543
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:55,927
Eat hot laser, you wimps.

544
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,435
And I thought
maybe you could --

545
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,197
Can't you see I'm going
for a high score?

546
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:01,772
Yeah, take a hike.

547
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,602
You jerks.

548
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:23,394
Hey!

549
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:47,178
Aah! I just wanted
someone to talk to!

550
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,754
Join the club.

551
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:50,821
A ghost!

552
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,515
Don't you come any closer, you!

553
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:53,556
No, no, wait!

554
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:54,557
I won't hurt you.

555
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:00,992
I'm warning you,
I've got a wand,

556
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,898
and I'm not afraid to use it.

557
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,901
Aah! A witch!
A witch!

558
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:22,853
Ah...

559
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:26,686
Are-Are you really
a-a w-w-witch?

560
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,122
Yeah. What of it?

561
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:31,252
Nothing. I just didn't
know witches were so...

562
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:32,796
Cute.

563
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,392
You think so?

564
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:42,401
Well, you're a ghost.

565
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:45,101
I was always told ghosts were...

566
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:47,041
spooky and mean, you know?

567
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,614
Most of us are, I guess.

568
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:50,772
But not me!

569
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,816
In fact, I'm friendly.

570
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:57,479
My aunts say,
"Never trust what you can't see."

571
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:58,555
But you can see me.

572
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,556
And I certainly can see you.

573
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,966
I'm Wendy.

574
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:18,974
I'm Casper.

575
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:21,101
Can you sit?

576
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:22,611
Abso-spookin'-lutely.

577
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:25,944
Do you have, like, horrific,
ghostly super powers?

578
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,643
Brace yourself...

579
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,220
for terror!

580
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,437
And what about you?

581
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,010
Can you really do magic
like David Copperfield?

582
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,509
Are you kidding?

583
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:56,376
He eats my pixie dust.

584
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,881
Watch this. Ah, ha.

585
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,516
Will you settle
forsomething small?

586
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,553
Sure.

587
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,195
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

588
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:13,627
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

589
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,995
Ho! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

590
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,465
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

591
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,503
Ho, ho, ho.

592
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:22,130
Ha ha. Sweet!

593
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,537
I can't believe my uncles
are so wrong

594
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:24,767
about witches.

595
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,203
There are other ghosts here?

596
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:30,542
Yeah, but all they ever
want to do

597
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,343
is scare people
and boss me around.

598
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,542
Tell me about it.

599
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,676
My aunts treat me
like I'm a nobody.

600
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:37,652
Guess we have a lot
in common, huh?

601
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:41,214
So, Wendy wanna do something?

602
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,487
Well, I'm sorta grounded, but...

603
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,222
let's have some fun!

604
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,599
Whoo!

605
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:00,204
Yeah!

606
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,081
Casper, come on.

607
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:02,337
Aah, aah, ooh!

608
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,557
Cannonball!

609
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:29,298
Ohh!

610
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,868
It's Desmond!

611
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:34,495
Help! I'm melting!

612
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:36,266
No, you're not.

613
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,843
Oh, I'm not.
I guess I'm not. Well...

614
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,833
Having a bad airday?

615
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,060
Casper?

616
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:37,396
Yeah?

617
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:38,866
I know this is gonna sound

618
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,368
really lame and all, but...

619
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:43,907
Whoa! This has been
the best day of my life.

620
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:45,271
Me, too.

621
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,071
Well, except for the life part.

622
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:52,381
It doesn't make any sense!

623
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,417
I have no friends, none.

624
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:56,919
And my family treats me
like I'm sludge.

625
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:57,920
I hear that.

626
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,717
And then you come along,

627
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:02,521
and I finally feel like
I'm somebody.

628
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,720
But I'm supposed to hate you.

629
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:07,196
Ch, it doesn't make any sense.

630
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,362
But we still are friends, right?

631
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,460
Wendy, friends doesn't come close

632
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:14,504
to describing how I feel.

633
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,099
Wait a second!

634
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:20,303
If my aunts find out
I'm friends with a ghost,

635
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:21,810
they'll throw a witchy fit.

636
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:24,244
I won't get to see you anymore.

637
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:26,282
And my uncles say
no self-respecting ghost

638
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,374
would talk to a nasty,
snaggle-toothed,

639
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,544
wart-ridden, hagged out --

640
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:30,484
Hey!

641
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:31,885
Oh, sorry.

642
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,479
So what do we do?

643
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,457
Hmm.

644
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,459
If we just got them
together somehow,

645
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:39,791
I just know that
they'd get along.

646
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:41,592
Sure, Wen, that'd work.

647
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:42,791
All we have to do

648
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,265
is turn your aunts into ghosts,

649
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:45,733
or my uncles into humans.

650
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:48,797
And I know just the way!

651
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:54,510
Hey, hey, everybody!
How's it going?

652
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:55,977
Guess what time it is.

653
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,811
It's limbo time!

654
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:01,647
Now, remember
only you can put the "Brite"

655
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,948
in Sunny Brite.

656
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:05,317
I'm going for a record here.

657
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:08,687
Ha. Right here.
Who thinks they can beat this?

658
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,317
Beat him?

659
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:11,986
My pleasure.

660
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:15,597
Awk-akk!

661
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:17,997
Awk-akk!

662
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:22,236
Aah.

663
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:27,968
Oh, cabana boy!

664
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:30,843
Can we have three more
big ones over here, please?

665
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:32,177
Sure. Just a second.

666
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:33,307
Would you like anything, honey?

667
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:35,852
Yes, the cabana boy.

668
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:37,387
Oh! Ha!

669
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:38,853
Ch, oh, and cabin boy

670
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:41,152
can you bring us back
some of those nice,

671
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:42,282
um, low-fat pretzels?

672
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,326
In fact, bring us a whole case.

673
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:44,360
Yeah!

674
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:45,394
A drink, please.

675
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:46,964
Here you are.

676
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,293
My chair. I'm thinking
I'd like it much higher.

677
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:50,298
Your chair?

678
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,300
Aah!

679
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,496
Massage here?

680
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:54,503
Oh, fabulous.

681
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:55,470
A towel, please.

682
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,305
Take off my shoes.

683
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,344
And while you're at it,

684
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:03,379
find me some nail polish.

685
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,073
I want you to do my toes.

686
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:08,543
I'll be right back.

687
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,528
Madam!

688
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:21,530
Hey, sugar-shorts,
how about a date?

689
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:24,124
Uh, December 7th, 1941.
Yeah.

690
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:29,064
I just love when
they play hard to get.

691
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:33,033
I win.
Rock smashes paper.

692
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:34,542
No, rock smashes scissors.

693
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,010
When did they change the rules?

694
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,945
It's always been that way,
Potato Head.

695
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:40,517
Anyways, paper covers rock.

696
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,710
So I win.

697
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:44,516
What are you two idiots doing?

698
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,353
Come and watch the radar.

699
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,789
Listen to me.

700
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,722
Psst! Psst!

701
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:57,131
Hey, did I spring a leak
or something?

702
00:43:57,234 --> 00:44:00,033
You all call this
scouting for danger?

703
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,469
Yeah, dangerous Desmond.

704
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:04,774
Hmm.

705
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:05,774
Wendy!

706
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:06,775
What are you doing here?

707
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:08,606
Relax. I was really careful.

708
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:10,305
I had to tell you something.

709
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,246
What could possibly be
so important

710
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:13,783
that you'd risk our safety?

711
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:16,376
There's a dance tonight.

712
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,352
Dance?

713
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:21,219
Groovy.

714
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,315
The Monkey.

715
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:23,325
The Swim.

716
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:24,485
The Electric Slide.

717
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:26,256
The Funky Chicken.

718
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:28,297
Did somebody say "fried chicken?"

719
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:31,232
No, not chicken.

720
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,394
Hey, it could be "hunk city."

721
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,302
Oh, color us there.

722
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:36,840
Let's color
our little niece Wendy

723
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,339
straight back to her room,

724
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:39,432
solving this Desmond mess.

725
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:41,568
Now goon, scoot.

726
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,306
Hey, I'll hold onto this.

727
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:44,347
Goon now.

728
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:48,574
Impossible child.

729
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,621
Unh.

730
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:53,588
Hey, watch it.

731
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,318
Oh, hi, doll face!

732
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:57,417
Bye, dog face!

733
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,589
Look, I forgive you
about that video game thing.

734
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,995
Get a clue.

735
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:03,692
Hey you better be nice

736
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:05,667
or l won't take you to the dance.

737
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,203
Horrors!

738
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:08,965
Besides, I met someone else.

739
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:10,131
Good-looking, too.

740
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,504
Better than me?

741
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:14,634
Yeah, very pale, no hair,

742
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:16,179
and hangs out in cemeteries.

743
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,544
Look, you're going
to the dance with me,

744
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:19,775
and that's that.

745
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,317
Josh, you are way behind

746
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:22,817
on 90s' dating rituals,

747
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,685
and maybe you need to "catch up."

748
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:34,363
Aah!

749
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,465
Whoa!

750
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:37,534
Aah!

751
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:39,227
Get off me!

752
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:41,532
What do you think
you're doing, you little twerp?

753
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:42,537
Whoa!

754
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,404
Enjoy your bath, Joshy.

755
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:50,606
Nobody makes Josh Jackman
look like a geek!

756
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,175
Hello, Karnak.

757
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:56,844
Have you found her?

758
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:59,423
Damn. Well, then, keep looking.

778
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:06,815
You liked that?

779
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:09,086
Yeah. Could you teach me
some tricks like that?

780
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:11,127
Casper the Friendly Ghost

781
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:13,458
wants to scare fleshies?

782
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:14,895
Somebody pinch me.

783
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:18,400
So, uh, what'll it be, kid?
Eerie groans?

784
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,731
Ectoplasmic slimings?

785
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,134
Round-trip pizza?

786
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:23,502
Actually I was thinking...

787
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:24,665
possession.

788
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:26,265

to the right place,

789
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:28,845
Bulb Head,
'cause we're experts.

790
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:31,472
In fact, we hold the time record

791
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:33,175
for inhabiting fleshies.

792
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:35,251
Yeah, I know.

793
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,514
Except... Well...

794
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:39,680
I just read in
The Grimace Book of World Records

795
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,451
that someone broke it.

796
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:42,753
What?

797
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,828
Boys, we gotta reclaim our title.

798
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:45,861
How about
at the big dance tonight?

799
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:47,089
You're on.

800
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,130
Yeah.

801
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:49,495
Come on, lads.

802
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,863
We gotta find us
some fleshies to invade.

803
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:52,834
Let's get 'em. Come on.

804
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:05,882
Yo!

805
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:08,645
Let us slick back our pompadours

806
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:11,050
and prepare ourselves
for a little romance.

807
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:13,248
Oh, yeah, these rich resort babes,

808
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:15,257
you know, they melt
like chocolate bars

809
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,191
on a dashboard, am I right?

810
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:19,058
Ch, baby

811
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:21,563
Ch, yeah, oh yeah.

812
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:24,293
Oh, man.
What happened to my $20 tan?

813
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,392
I look-- I look sick.

814
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:28,130
Boo!

815
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,172
Aah!

816
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:37,445

817
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:38,981
Aah!

818
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:43,212
Ohh...

819
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,551

820
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:48,455
Comin' through, pal.

821
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:50,458
Aah!

822
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:04,530
Yeah.

823
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:06,769
Yeah!

824
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:08,845
Hey, it's dark in here.

825
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,744
No wonder.
I went in backwards.

826
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:13,248
Wow! Oh, eeee.

Oh, you're disgusting!

887
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:31,576
Sorry, lady.
Didn't know.

888
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:33,945
'Snot polite.

889
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,074
Ohh.

890
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:38,382
Mmm. So...
I says to him,

891
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,252
"What do you mean,
penguins can't fly?"

892
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:41,290
And then Nanook,

893
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:43,257
he hurls up a wad of blubber,

894
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,556
and he says...

895
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,756
"Oh, don't brush those off,
'cause you never know

896
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:50,265
when you're going to run
out of food in this joint."

897
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:51,960
That would be terrible.

898
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:55,736

there's one of you.

899
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,170

900
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:59,743

901
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,073
Uh, I got to go,
uh...kill some bugs.

00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,271

903
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,575
Wait a minute.

904
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,706
Oh, I, um--
Well, then call us.

905
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:08,045
We got his jacket!

00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:57,149
Oh, well...

926
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,319
Isn't he delicious?

927
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:03,263
I never met anyone with
such a fascinating...

928
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:05,232
earthy quality.

929
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:09,796
Oh, you take my breath away!

930
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:13,035
Aw, shucks. Let's dance.

931
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,304
OK.

932
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:17,946
Look, Casper,

933
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:19,948

935
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:28,620

Come with me, Wendy.

937
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:33,362
There she is.

938
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:36,091
Let's see who this hunk is
that she dumped me for.

939
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:42,595
Ha ha! Whoa, Casper.
What's wrong?

940
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:45,641
Nothing.
I was just wondering if --

941
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:48,268
Well, uh,

942
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:50,676
would you like to dance?

943
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,908
Really? Sure.

944
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,984
Right here?
Right now?

945
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:57,144
No. Over there.

946
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:00,321
Cool OK.

947
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:03,552
Wait a sec.
Let me change.

948
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,355
Wow!

949
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:07,760
You look...magical.

950
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,026

Black tie.
I'm impressed.

958

Shall we?

959
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:51,339
Well, here goes nothing.

960
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,414
I -- I don't dance very good,

961
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:00,074
especially when
someone's looking.

962
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:03,118

Who's that?

971
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,984
Nobody important.

972
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:41,750
Sure sounds important.

973
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:43,383
Mini-doughnut?

974
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:45,962
Oh! Don't mind if l do.

975
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:46,995
Mmm...

976
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:55,338
What a fascinating aroma!

977
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:57,736
Yeah.
I was just mixing up a potion.

978
00:57:57,841 --> 00:57:58,967
Lotion.

979
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:01,009
Moldy tree roots,

980
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:03,772
sour bat milk, and...

981
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:04,779
rancid garlic?

982
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:06,815
Oh! A connoisseur!

983
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:11,387
Hey, hey,
get a load of this one, huh?

984
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:14,316
Drinks are on me!

985
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,690
Hey, what did the pigeon
say to the statue?

986
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:21,230
- What?
- What?

987
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,457
"Pardon me,

988
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:25,557
but do you have any
'Gray Poop On' you?"

989
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:30,130
You're such a witty man.

990
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:35,511
Hey, whoever thought

991
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:38,877
fleshies could've been
such fun, huh?

992
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:39,949
Unh! Unh!

993
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:43,886
What?

994
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:50,757
Are you guys OK?

995
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:51,827
Yeah.

996
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:54,363
Old football injury.

997
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:55,954
Graah! It's the music!

998
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:58,124
Yeah!
We can't get that beat

999
00:58:58,234 --> 00:58:59,702
out of our systems!

1000
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:00,826
Oh, goody.

1001
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:02,530
It's dance time!

1002
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:03,367
Yaah!

1003
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:05,237
Ohh -- Unh!

1004
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:06,399
Hey, watch it!

1005
00:59:06,509 --> 00:59:07,943
Come on, Stinky!

1006
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:14,812
Well, excuse me!

1007
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:19,615
Hey! OK, I'll move.

1008
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:22,483
Great steps.

1009
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:23,821
Look at that boogie.
I can dig it.

1010
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:35,302
- Oh! - Huh? -Aah!

1011
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:42,411
Let's go.

1012
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,051
Man, I love the Twist, too!

1013
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:49,482
Oh!

1014
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:52,545
Aah!

1015
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,659
Oh!

1016
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,456
This guy inside me

1017
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:02,327
is really fighting!

1018
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:03,900
Mine, too!

1019
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,092
- Ohh...
- Oh...

1020
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:09,070
Oh, no. It's been too long.
They're losing control.

1021
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:11,470
Show us some
of those wild moves.

1022
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:12,700
Oh, like this.

1023
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,187
Hey...

1024
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,152
Akk! Unh! Hyah!

1025
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:27,348
- Oh! - Aah! -Oh!

1026
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:39,392
Oh, no, Casper.

1027
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:41,698
Our plan just went down in flames.

1028
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,829
Like the Hindenberg.

1029
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,271
Oh, gee,

1030
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:47,309
we haven't had
this much fun in centuries!

1031
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:48,343
Oh!

1032
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:49,434
Uh, decades.

1033
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:50,774
Weeks!

1034
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,848
Excuse us, ladies.

1035
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:54,212
You know, gals,

1036
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:56,012
this is a match made in heaven.

1037
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:58,247
I think we have
marriage material here.

1038
01:00:58,354 --> 01:00:59,185
Let's go!

1039
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:06,654
Folks, uh, hold on here.

1040
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:08,697
I think we'll just take
a little short break here,

1041
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:10,391
uh, so we don't break
anything else.

1042
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:15,634
Is everything OK?

1043
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:19,772
Look!

1044
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:21,139
Uh-oh.

1045
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:23,679
Ew! Ear wax!

1046
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:26,340
- Aah! - Aah! -Aah!

1047
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:28,679
- Aah! - Aah! -Aah!

1048
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:30,947
- Yaah! - Ahh! -Aah!

1049
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:33,318
Uh, hi, girls.

1050
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:35,221
- Ghosts! - Ghosts! -Ghosts!

1051
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,327
- Witches! - Witches! -Witches!

1052
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:42,694
Uh, Wendy and I can explain.

1053
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,392
Yeah. See, Casper came up
with this great idea.

1054
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,865
Do you mean to tell me

1055
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:47,868
that you have been
hanging around with this --

1056
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:49,870
this floating roll
of toilet paper?

1057
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:51,906
Yeah. Get away from her

1058
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:53,442
before she gives you warts.

1059
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:54,476
But we're friends!

1060
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:55,738
No. No way

1061
01:01:55,845 --> 01:01:57,779
I will not let you
associate with this --

1062
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,905
this puff of --
of secondhand smoke!

1063
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:00,949
That's rich,

1064
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,849
coming from a disenchanter!

1065
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:05,216
Go rattle your chains!

1066
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:06,789
Go peddle your potions!

1067
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,153
Oh, make us,
you big Dairy Queen butts!

1068
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:10,987
That's it!
We're coming over

1069
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:12,653
and scaring
the bloomers off of you!

1070
01:02:12,762 --> 01:02:13,786
In the name

1071
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:16,729
of the great sorcerer Nogamo,

1072
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:18,062
I command:

1073
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:20,829
that you turn
these spirits into bean bags!

1074
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:23,099
Hey! Hey!
Now, now, just a second...

1075
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:26,335
- One.
- Y-You wouldn't dare.

1076
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:27,841
- Two --
- Bye.

1077
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:30,003
Run away!

1078
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:34,308
Three.

1079
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:36,010
What was all that?

1080
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:37,814
It was a bluff.

1081
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,910
Oh.

1082
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:41,080
Now, what is in
your brain, child?

1083
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:44,251
Don't you understand
that ghosts are our enemies?

1084
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,260
But Casper isn't!
He's jus --

1085
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:47,761
Look, girls, we can't
hang around here anymore.

1086
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:49,423
We're going to have to go
find another hiding place.

1087
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:52,024
No! I like it here,
and I'm really, really sorry,

1088
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:54,695
and l'll find Casper,
and l'll fix everything.

1089
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:56,238
Ay --

1090
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:58,535
No way, Red.
Now, march yourself

1091
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:00,131
straight back into your room.

1092
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,209
Hey, Casper,

1093
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:11,650
meet me back here in five minutes.

1094
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:13,483
Roger.

1095
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:16,354
Ew! Witch germs!

1096
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:19,656
I can't believe
I actually touched her.

1097
01:03:19,762 --> 01:03:22,663
You touched.
I mini-doughnuted!

1098
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:29,500
Oh, I think
I'm going to blow ectoplasm.

1099
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:31,869
Vacation's over, boys.

1100
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:34,102
If we want to win back
our self-respect,

1101
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:37,339
we got to scare
those witches out of here!

1102
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:38,777
Oww!

1103
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:02,795
Casper.

1104
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:03,770
Ow!

1105
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:06,035
Easy on the pottery.

1106
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:07,974
Better go into stealth mode.

1107
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:17,417
Oh, boy.
We messed up good.

1108
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,646
No fooling.

1109
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:20,449
We got to stick together, Casper.

1110
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:22,251
My uncles don' twant me
near you.

1111
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:24,486
They say you witches have
killer magic.

1112
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:26,619
Oh, we've got it,
but I can't use it.

1113
01:04:26,729 --> 01:04:28,663
Come again?

1114
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:31,529
OK, here's the deal.

1115
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:33,966
But you promise
you cannot tell anyone.

1116
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,060
Got it?

1117
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:37,538
Cross my heart
and hope to live.

1118
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:42,604
I downloaded this
off the Internet.

1119
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,612
The Top 100 Warlocks.

1120
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:45,943
At the top of the list

1121
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:49,018
is this bad boy
Desmond Spellman.

1122
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:51,951
He's super powerful,
and he's after me.

1123
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:53,146
Why?

1124
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:55,190
I haven't a clue,
but if my aunts or I

1125
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:57,225
use any big magic,
he'll find us

1126
01:04:57,326 --> 01:04:59,590
and destroy us --
Got it?

1127
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:01,026
Destroy you? How?

1128
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:03,428
This is the only sure way...

1129
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:05,227
besides dropping
a house on us.

1130
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:07,928
It's called the Mystic Abyss,

1131
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:11,405
and whatever goes in
vanishes...forever

1132
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:13,168
No. He can't!

1133
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:16,374
Down!

1134
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,316
Peaches and Cream,
this party's over.

1135
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:28,914
Uh, Good dog. Sit up.

1136
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:30,424
- Uh, ruff-ruff!
- Good boy.

1137
01:05:33,062 --> 01:05:34,757
Now do you see why my aunts

1138
01:05:34,864 --> 01:05:36,559
can't afford a fight right now?

1139
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:37,792
Wow. That's harsh.

1140
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,265
So will you talk
to your uncles

1141
01:05:39,368 --> 01:05:41,359
and keep them
away from us?

1142
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:42,938
Then I won't have to leave.

1143
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:43,972
Please?

1144
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:45,404
Well, sure, but --
You see,

1145
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:46,976
I'm not very good
at standing up to them.

1146
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:48,510
Casper, you've got to.

1147
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,170
This is life or death.
Please!

1148
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:52,407
Uh, sure, Wendy.
Don't worry.

1149
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:53,914
I'll fix everything.

1150
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:55,040
And remember,

1151
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:57,210
don't say anything
about the magic.

1152
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,287
I promise.

1153
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:10,297
Huh!

1154
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:11,889
This is no good.

1155
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:13,662
All right, listen up.

1156
01:06:13,769 --> 01:06:15,396
I have something to say.

1157
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:17,233
There's the little traitor.

1158
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,707
Yeah.
Way to go, air bag.

1159
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,834
You almost got us killed --
Again!

1160
01:06:21,944 --> 01:06:24,140
Aren't you jumping to conclusions?

1161
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:26,442
Wake up and smell
the funeral roses.

1162
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:28,608
Witches are dangerous.

1163
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:30,083
So we got to attack them

1164
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:31,745
before they attack us.

1165
01:06:31,854 --> 01:06:33,049
Now, just
a doggone minute.

1166
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:34,850
I have some say in this family,

1167
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:37,119
and I'm telling you to layoff!

1168
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:39,285
Uh, please?

1169
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:41,124
Who do you think you are?

1170
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:42,391
Yeah.
We know more than you.

1171
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:43,932
Those witches mean business.

1172
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:45,023
Yeah. I'm not backing down.

1173
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:45,999
Let's get 'em.

1174
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:47,069
Right now.

1175
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:48,068
Wait!

1176
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:49,934
No, but -- but -- uh, listen!

1177
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:51,768
Why are you protecting them?

1178
01:06:51,874 --> 01:06:54,935
Becausetheycan't
usetheirpowers--Ch!*

1179
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:56,637
What did you say?

1180
01:06:56,746 --> 01:06:59,340
No powers?

1181
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:02,076
So the witches are helpless.

1182
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:05,677
Boys, it's time
for a little revenge.

1183
01:07:05,788 --> 01:07:06,653
For glory!

1184
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:08,019
For honor!

1185
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:09,888
Formerly known as Prince!

1186
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:13,257
No! Stop! I promised
nothing would hap -- Whoah!

1187
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:15,694
Wait! Wait!
Let me explain--

1188
01:07:16,832 --> 01:07:18,357
Whoaah...

1189
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:19,366
Gee...

1190
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:20,663
Maybe he's sick.

1191
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:23,000
He looked a little
flushed to me.

1192
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:25,073
- Ha ha! - Ha ha! - Ha ha!

1193
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:44,116
If it ain't the belle of the brawl.

1194
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:45,159
Oh!

1195
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:46,490
What do you want?

1196
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:48,222
Simple, newt-breath.

1197
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:50,697
This is our vacation spot, see?

1198
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,325
So make like Michael Jackson

1199
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:53,561
and beat it!

1200
01:07:53,669 --> 01:07:55,660
 Yeah! This place
ain't big enough

1201
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:56,704
for the both of us.

1202
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:57,773
Huh! In fact,

1203
01:07:57,873 --> 01:07:59,602
it's barely big enough for me.

1204
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:00,766
Never! And you guys

1205
01:08:00,876 --> 01:08:02,366
better get out of here before --

1206
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:03,639
Well, before we turn you

1207
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:05,714
into a year's supply of diapers!

1208
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:07,544
We happen to know for a fact

1209
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:11,052
that you broom jockeys
can't use magic.

1210
01:08:11,153 --> 01:08:12,211
What?

1211
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:13,584
Oh, my gosh...

1212
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:15,282
Casper told you!

1213
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:17,155
Yeah! Put that in your cauldron

1214
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,317
and stir it!

1215
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,828
Listen, you don't scare us.

1216
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,024
We scare you!

1217
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:24,691
Get 'em, boys!

1218
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:33,776
Aah!

1219
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:47,614
Oh...

1220
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:00,425
Ha ha! Missed me!

1221
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:07,369
Peek-a-boo!

1222
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:27,293
You leave my aunts alone!

1223
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:28,625
No!

1224
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:29,926
They were fast, 
but l was faster

1225
01:09:30,032 --> 01:09:32,558
Paint these ghosts
with a coat of plaster!

1226
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:41,043
Can't...move...arms...

1227
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:48,551
Yo, Desmond, we got us a blip!

1228
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:54,555
I've got you,
you little hex-hurler,

1229
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:57,888
and l'm going
to destroy you.

1230
01:09:57,993 --> 01:10:01,793
It's the de-witching hour!
Heh heh heh!

1231
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:10,138
Me, ruined?

1232
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,674
By a little teen witch?

1233
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:14,937
I don't think so.

1234
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,138
Think again,

1235
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:19,010
you pompous prestidigitator --

1236
01:10:19,114 --> 01:10:20,843
Aah!

1237
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:24,409
You get your phantom fannies
out of here!

1238
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:26,318
Yeah. Yeah. We're going.

1239
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:29,356
What's that?

1240
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:31,119
Let's go check it out.

1241
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:35,121
- Wendy -- 
- Yes! -Yay!

1242
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,199
You saved us!

1243
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:38,733
Well, of course.

1244
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:40,859
Nobody hurts my family.

1245
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:42,233
Except for me.

1246
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:43,362
Oh, you --

1247
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:44,962
Come on, let's go.

1248
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:49,671
Shh.

1249
01:10:51,046 --> 01:10:54,038
All right!
Wendy, Wendy, she's our lass.

1250
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:55,275
She kicked those ghosts

1251
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:56,442
right in the worst possible way!

1252
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:58,611
Haha! Wendy rules!

1253
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:00,211
Rules! Wendy rules! Yeah!

1254
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:02,620
La-la-la-la, all right!

1255
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:04,284
- Wendy!
- Ah, ha!

1256
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:06,623
Wendy rules!
Wendy rules!

1257
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:09,494
Um, excuse me, um...

1258
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:10,963
I'm really flattered,

1259
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:12,659
but I have to
tell you something.

1260
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:14,293
Oh, come on, little Niece.

1261
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:17,134
No bad news tonight.
This is your hero party.

1262
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:19,503
Well, in order
to save you all,

1263
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,633
I had to use my...wand.

1264
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:22,973
Huh?

1265
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:25,547
And Desmond's probably
on his way right now.

1266
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:29,814
Thanks a lot, loser.
Start packing.

1267
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:30,817
Oh...

1268
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:31,784
Nnggh!

1269
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:33,377
Way to go, Wendy

1270
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:37,024
It's not a fruit
or a vegetable.

1271
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:38,787
The tomato is a berry.

1272
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:40,919
Right, and
your old man's E.T.,

1273
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:42,589
'cause you ain't
from this planet.

1274
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:44,325
Go ahead.
Ignore my wealth of knowledge.

1275
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:45,628
Shut up, you two.

1276
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:47,202
When I'm through
with these witches,

1277
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,032
I'm going to
turn the two of you

1278
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:50,970
into milkshakes.
Ha ha!

1279
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:52,598
Ooh...

1280
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:54,369
Whoa!

1281
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:55,409
Right.

1282
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,240
Eww!

1283
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:14,423
Wendy! Wendy, my uncles
are on their way over--

1284
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:15,725
Thanks for the warning,

1285
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:18,061
but they've already
paid their respects.

1286
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,100
Oh, no.

1287
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:21,295
Oh, yes.
And how did they know

1288
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:23,201
that my aunts couldn't
fight back, hmm?

1289
01:12:23,305 --> 01:12:24,704
Wendy, I --

1290
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:26,502
Is this your idea of
making things better,

1291
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:28,576
by breaking promises?

1292
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,771
By giving away secrets?

1293
01:12:30,879 --> 01:12:33,405
How could you?
I thought you were my friend.

1294
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:35,779
I am!
Wendy just let me explain --

1295
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:37,682
No! And I never want
to see you again!

1296
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:39,015
Now, beat it

1297
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:41,556
before I turn you
into a bean bag chair!

1298
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:42,590
Wendy I --

1299
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:45,126
No! Just -- Just leave.

1300
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:56,268
Wow. Yeah! Cool!

1301
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,397
It's that kid again.

1302
01:12:58,507 --> 01:12:59,633
So cool...

1303
01:12:59,742 --> 01:13:01,938
Wendy never let me
play with her wand

1304
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:05,105
She must like him
more than me.

1305
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:07,376
Wait till I get my hands
on that little shrimp.

1306
01:13:07,483 --> 01:13:08,973
This is all his fault.

1307
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:11,485
I normally like
to get plastered.

1308
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:18,483
Way to go, dish rag.

1309
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:20,528
You led us right into a trap.

1310
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:22,723
Yeah.
Those broomstick bimbos

1311
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:24,060
disgraced us.

1312
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:25,429
I messed up everything.

1313
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:27,525
You can say that again.

1314
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:29,468
I'm talking about the witches.

1315
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:31,198
This warlock's coming after them,

1316
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:33,274
and now they've got
to run for their lives.

1317
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:34,706
These people are in big trouble,

1318
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:36,369
and they need our help.

1319
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:38,469
Us help witches?

1320
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:39,479
No way!

1321
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:40,605
No how!

1322
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:42,275
No shirt, no shoes, no service.

1323
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:43,249
You know,

1324
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:45,377
you three like to act nasty

1325
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:46,921
and talk big and be selfish,

1326
01:13:47,022 --> 01:13:48,353
but tonight,
you did something

1327
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:51,154
I'm never going
to let you forget.

1328
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,955
You cared about those witches.

1329
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:54,256
Yeah, well...

1330
01:13:54,363 --> 01:13:55,626
we was just pretending.

1331
01:14:24,059 --> 01:14:25,254
Go...

1332
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,091
and search the cabins.

1333
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:34,564
Come on, Red, we got
to put some sky behind us.

1334
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:36,138
But I got to find my wand.

1335
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:37,330
I just had it right here.

1336
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,736
Look, forget about it, OK?

1337
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:40,036
Look, it's nothing but trouble.

1338
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,303
But I have to look --

1339
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:42,639
No, you don't have to look.

1340
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:43,905
But what about my powers?

1341
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:45,377
No buts, all right?
Let's go.

1342
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:46,778
Witches, are we ready?

1343
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:47,747
But I have to --

1344
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:49,409
Here's your broom.
Be quiet.

1345
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:51,612
Let's try that one over there.

1346
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,279
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1347
01:14:53,388 --> 01:14:54,787
You get that TV
you wanted?

1348
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:56,016
- It's them!
- Oh!

1349
01:14:56,124 --> 01:14:57,592
Let's fly out the window.

1350
01:14:57,693 --> 01:14:59,252
No, we can't!
They'll spot us.

1351
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:01,261
Well, what are
we going to do?

1352
01:15:01,363 --> 01:15:02,660
I have an idea!

1353
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:05,865
What do you want a TV for?

1354
01:15:05,968 --> 01:15:07,265
I don't need a TV.

1355
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:09,269
I got the pictures
in my brain -- Ow!

1356
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:10,736
Hey.
We're walking here!

1357
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:12,432
Hey, you see
any witches around here?

1358
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:15,033
- No habla lngles.
- No. - No.

1359
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:16,838
Are they following?

1360
01:15:16,945 --> 01:15:18,538
No. I think we made it.

1361
01:15:23,385 --> 01:15:24,284
Yes?

1362
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:26,286
They went that way.

1363
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,587
Thank you.

1364
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:35,561
Baaa.

1365
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:47,566
Wait a minute,
wait a minute!

1366
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:48,837
Let's get rid
of this garb, OK?

1367
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:49,843
OK.

1368
01:15:49,945 --> 01:15:50,810
1... 2... 3...

1369
01:15:52,614 --> 01:15:53,638
OK, let's go.
Come on.

1370
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:54,682
Hurry.

1371
01:15:58,283 --> 01:15:59,717
Leaving so soon?

1372
01:15:59,818 --> 01:16:01,115
- Aah! - Aah! -Aah! -Aah!

1373
01:16:01,219 --> 01:16:02,152
Go!

1374
01:16:02,254 --> 01:16:04,120
Move it, move it --

1375
01:16:04,222 --> 01:16:06,156
Hurry. Oh.

1376
01:16:06,258 --> 01:16:07,157
Oh, hurry.

1377
01:16:07,259 --> 01:16:09,057
- Ohh --
- Oh.

1378
01:16:10,629 --> 01:16:12,290
Ch, no.

1379
01:16:13,798 --> 01:16:16,665
♪ La la la-la la ♪

1380
01:16:16,768 --> 01:16:18,600
- Aah!
- Aah!

1381
01:16:31,149 --> 01:16:32,446
Hey!

1382
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:33,415
Sit down.

1383
01:16:33,518 --> 01:16:34,952
Yeah.

1384
01:16:43,662 --> 01:16:44,823
You're the big, bad Wendy, eh?

1385
01:16:44,929 --> 01:16:46,124
Yeah.

1386
01:16:46,231 --> 01:16:48,359
And you're the geek
who's been hounding me.

1387
01:16:48,466 --> 01:16:50,093
What do you want,
my lunch money?

1388
01:16:52,771 --> 01:16:54,865
It's like this, kiddo.

1389
01:16:54,973 --> 01:16:55,963
The Oracle said

1390
01:16:56,074 --> 01:16:58,634
that you are
a greater witch than I.

1391
01:16:58,743 --> 01:16:59,869
- Her? - Her? - Her?

1392
01:16:59,978 --> 01:17:01,946
That's what l said

1393
01:17:02,047 --> 01:17:05,176
But then the Oracle
is never wrong.

1394
01:17:07,886 --> 01:17:09,285
Are you?

1395
01:17:09,387 --> 01:17:11,185
No, sir.
Never wrong.

1396
01:17:13,692 --> 01:17:16,889
I had a devil
of a time finding you.

1397
01:17:16,995 --> 01:17:20,932
How did you live
without magic so long?

1398
01:17:21,032 --> 01:17:22,261
Well, we cut down

1399
01:17:22,367 --> 01:17:23,960
on between-meal spells and --

1400
01:17:24,069 --> 01:17:25,434
Stop it.
It's none of his business.

1401
01:17:26,805 --> 01:17:30,935
No matter.
You'll soon be out of my hair.

1402
01:17:31,042 --> 01:17:34,444
By the way,
how does it look?

1403
01:17:34,546 --> 01:17:36,605
Nary a one out of place.

1404
01:17:36,715 --> 01:17:37,910
Thank you.

1405
01:17:38,016 --> 01:17:39,381
Wait! If you're mad at me,

1406
01:17:39,484 --> 01:17:41,009
why punish them?

1407
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:42,609
If l get rid of you,

1408
01:17:42,721 --> 01:17:45,622
I can't very well
leave relatives behind

1409
01:17:45,724 --> 01:17:49,058
who'll want revenge,
now, can I?

1410
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,525
Won't take a minute.

1411
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:53,329
Hold it right there, bucko!

1412
01:17:54,833 --> 01:17:55,891
Bucko?

1413
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,832
Casper, you came back.

1414
01:17:57,936 --> 01:17:58,801
Yadda, yadda, yadda.

1415
01:18:00,905 --> 01:18:01,997
- Help.
- That's right.

1416
01:18:02,107 --> 01:18:03,939
The Oracle mentioned a ghost.

1417
01:18:04,042 --> 01:18:06,238
But never mentioned one so puny.

1418
01:18:06,344 --> 01:18:07,470
You leave Wendy alone!

1419
01:18:07,579 --> 01:18:10,844
A ghost defending a witch?

1420
01:18:10,949 --> 01:18:13,884
Now I've seen everything.

1421
01:18:13,985 --> 01:18:14,850
Aah! Omph!

1422
01:18:16,154 --> 01:18:17,485
Stop hurting him!

1423
01:18:17,589 --> 01:18:21,025
Oh, my.
How very, very...

1424
01:18:21,126 --> 01:18:22,059
sickening.

1425
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:23,650
If l hadn't lost my wand,

1426
01:18:23,762 --> 01:18:26,026
I'd knock that smirk
right off your face.

1427
01:18:26,131 --> 01:18:29,328
Yes. Too bad, isn't it?

1428
01:18:31,836 --> 01:18:33,600
Casper! No!

1429
01:18:35,073 --> 01:18:36,768
- Ha ha ha.
- No!

1430
01:18:36,875 --> 01:18:39,810
Man, this is getting monotonous.

1431
01:18:39,911 --> 01:18:41,606
Wendy's wand.

1432
01:18:44,015 --> 01:18:46,245
Let's see how snotty
you are without your stick,

1433
01:18:46,351 --> 01:18:47,716
Miss I'm-Too-Good-For-You!

1434
01:18:51,356 --> 01:18:54,656
Normally, it's against mypolicy
to scare people.

1435
01:18:54,759 --> 01:18:56,727
But this is an emergency.

1436
01:18:56,828 --> 01:18:57,920
- Aah!
- Aah!

1437
01:19:01,533 --> 01:19:03,763
My, that was cleansing.

1438
01:19:07,305 --> 01:19:10,206
From the halls of Kukaluma,

1439
01:19:10,308 --> 01:19:12,936
to the shores of Xanadee,

1440
01:19:13,044 --> 01:19:17,811
I call upon the dark forces
of yadda, yadda, yadda.

1441
01:19:17,916 --> 01:19:21,750
By the power vested in me
etcetera, etcetera,

1442
01:19:21,853 --> 01:19:27,383
open the Door of Dread.

1443
01:20:22,313 --> 01:20:29,549
Behold, the Mystic Abyss.

1444
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:35,191
Once a victim enters,

1445
01:20:35,293 --> 01:20:37,352
she never comes out;
convenient, eh?

1446
01:20:45,603 --> 01:20:47,298
- Wendy!
- Casper!

1447
01:20:54,979 --> 01:20:55,912
Ta-da!

1448
01:20:58,750 --> 01:20:59,615
Stop him!

1449
01:21:03,187 --> 01:21:04,848
You flying pillow case,
come here!

1450
01:21:10,895 --> 01:21:12,056
Casper, come on.
Over here.

1451
01:21:13,364 --> 01:21:14,229
Hurry.

1452
01:21:17,869 --> 01:21:19,234
This what you're looking for?

1453
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:53,369
That was not bad.

1454
01:21:53,471 --> 01:21:57,203
But not nearly as powerful as me.

1455
01:22:03,881 --> 01:22:05,474
Help! Help!

1456
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:07,642
Wendy!

1457
01:22:07,752 --> 01:22:10,653
Hang on, Little Red!

1458
01:22:10,755 --> 01:22:12,052
Aah! Help me!

1459
01:22:13,191 --> 01:22:15,182
Hold on, we're coming.

1460
01:22:15,293 --> 01:22:18,058
Hang on, Little Red!

1461
01:22:20,665 --> 01:22:23,100
No! Wait!

1462
01:22:23,201 --> 01:22:24,600
Not so fast.

1463
01:22:26,371 --> 01:22:27,270
Wendy!

1464
01:22:28,906 --> 01:22:32,604
Aaah!

1465
01:22:37,348 --> 01:22:38,873
Help me!

1466
01:22:54,832 --> 01:22:56,300
My work's done here.

1467
01:22:58,136 --> 01:22:59,160
You ain't going nowhere.

1468
01:23:14,786 --> 01:23:16,618
They're gonna trap Wendy!

1469
01:23:28,633 --> 01:23:32,092
Wendy!

1470
01:23:34,839 --> 01:23:36,500
Casper!

1471
01:23:37,675 --> 01:23:40,337
Aah! Casper, please help!

1472
01:23:44,615 --> 01:23:47,141
Casper, I'm so sorry
I doubted you.

1473
01:23:47,251 --> 01:23:49,151
Forget that. Just hang on!

1474
01:23:57,762 --> 01:23:58,490
Keep pulling!

1475
01:23:58,596 --> 01:24:00,155
Silly spice and everything nice...

1476
01:24:05,636 --> 01:24:07,070
♪ I'm a little tea pot,
short and stout ♪

1477
01:24:07,171 --> 01:24:08,570
♪ Here is my handle,
here is my spout ♪

1478
01:24:08,673 --> 01:24:09,936
♪ When I get all steamed up
watch me shout ♪

1479
01:24:10,041 --> 01:24:11,600
♪ Tip me over
and pour me out ♪

1480
01:24:11,709 --> 01:24:14,679
Witches one,
witches all,

1481
01:24:14,779 --> 01:24:17,146
let's get Desmond after all.

1482
01:24:22,153 --> 01:24:26,613
Oh, ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1483
01:24:26,724 --> 01:24:27,657
You mussed my hair

1484
01:24:27,759 --> 01:24:30,421
I've been itching to show off.

1485
01:24:33,197 --> 01:24:34,961
Ah, I'm a man.

1486
01:24:36,968 --> 01:24:39,062
I'm a French dish.

1487
01:24:39,170 --> 01:24:42,538
Ugh! I'm repulsive.

1488
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:44,301
Ha ha ha.

1489
01:24:44,408 --> 01:24:46,672
Let's get out of this.

1490
01:24:54,185 --> 01:24:57,712
Now you're going
to be fertilizer.

1491
01:24:57,822 --> 01:24:59,551
Ooh!

1492
01:25:17,041 --> 01:25:20,204
Noo!

1493
01:25:20,311 --> 01:25:22,006
Have a nice trip.

1494
01:25:22,113 --> 01:25:23,205
See you next fall.

1495
01:25:27,685 --> 01:25:28,675
Give me that, you little witch.

1496
01:25:35,693 --> 01:25:37,092
Wendy's still in there!

1497
01:25:37,195 --> 01:25:38,959
So is Casper.

1498
01:25:39,063 --> 01:25:40,428
Hang on, Wendy!

1499
01:25:40,531 --> 01:25:42,363
We're coming to get you.

1500
01:25:42,466 --> 01:25:44,366
We'll get the door,
you grab the kids.

1501
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:50,073
Casper!

1502
01:25:53,377 --> 01:25:54,344
Aah!

1503
01:25:54,445 --> 01:25:56,277
Help!
Help me, Casper!

1504
01:26:04,155 --> 01:26:05,987
Come on. Help me.

1505
01:26:06,090 --> 01:26:06,989
Pull! Pull!

1506
01:26:10,761 --> 01:26:11,660
Hold on,Wendy!

1507
01:26:19,303 --> 01:26:21,431
Hang on.
We're coming to get you.

1508
01:26:21,539 --> 01:26:25,237
1, 2, 3...

1509
01:26:32,884 --> 01:26:35,512
Wendy. Wendy. Little Red.

1510
01:26:35,620 --> 01:26:38,521
Wendy.
Little Red, are you OK?

1511
01:26:41,192 --> 01:26:43,092
Aw, come on, Little Wart.

1512
01:26:43,194 --> 01:26:45,219
Wendy, are you OK?

1513
01:26:45,329 --> 01:26:47,991
You can make it.

1514
01:26:50,268 --> 01:26:52,430
Oh, Wendy.

1515
01:26:52,536 --> 01:26:54,800
Mm-hmm.
Give mea hug and I will be.

1516
01:26:54,906 --> 01:26:55,771
Oh.

1517
01:27:07,852 --> 01:27:09,650
I love you.

1518
01:27:09,754 --> 01:27:12,815
Wendy, you're OK.

1519
01:27:16,961 --> 01:27:18,486
I knew you wouldn't bail.

1520
01:27:18,596 --> 01:27:19,722
Yeah, well, we figured

1521
01:27:19,830 --> 01:27:22,492
we couldn't let you
have all the fun.

1522
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:24,796
Let's go get some breakfast.

1523
01:27:24,902 --> 01:27:27,928
Yeah,
French toast drowning in syrup.

1524
01:27:28,039 --> 01:27:29,564
Do you know

1525
01:27:29,674 --> 01:27:31,699
what they call
French toast in Paris?

1526
01:27:31,809 --> 01:27:34,073
Uh, toast?

1527
01:27:34,178 --> 01:27:36,146
No.
They call it Pain Perdu.

1528
01:27:36,247 --> 01:27:38,181
Means lost bread

1529
01:27:38,282 --> 01:27:39,272
Because, see, they use

1530
01:27:39,383 --> 01:27:41,010
the old bread from yesterday --

1531
01:27:49,593 --> 01:27:51,425
My sisters and I want to, um,

1532
01:27:51,529 --> 01:27:56,592

1533
01:27:56,701 --> 01:28:02,162
Thank. My sisters and I
want to thank you...

1534
01:28:02,273 --> 01:28:03,798
for everything
you've done for us.

1535
01:28:03,908 --> 01:28:04,898
Well, OK

1536
01:28:05,009 --> 01:28:09,139
But don't expect it
all the time.

1537
01:28:09,246 --> 01:28:12,011
Yeah, yeah, don't rush me.

1538
01:28:12,116 --> 01:28:15,211
And I wanted to say
we sorta didn't mind

1539
01:28:15,319 --> 01:28:17,310
getting to know you hags,

1540
01:28:17,421 --> 01:28:18,911
uh, gals.

1541
01:28:20,624 --> 01:28:23,491
Really? Thanks.

1542
01:28:23,594 --> 01:28:25,460
Attention, please. Listen.

1543
01:28:25,563 --> 01:28:26,758
Here is the latest.

1544
01:28:26,864 --> 01:28:29,925
Desmond is now gone,
and Wendy is greatest.

1545
01:28:30,034 --> 01:28:33,334
Her?
She's the greatest witch?

1546
01:28:33,437 --> 01:28:35,531
She did something 
no other can boast.

1547
01:28:35,639 --> 01:28:38,040
This little witch
befriended a ghost.

1548
01:28:38,142 --> 01:28:39,803
So Wendy you're the greatest.

1549
01:28:39,910 --> 01:28:41,173
It is her l select.

1550
01:28:41,278 --> 01:28:44,908
Someday she'll be queen,
so show some respect.

1551
01:28:45,016 --> 01:28:46,040
Yes.

1552
01:28:46,150 --> 01:28:47,447
Hail, Wendy.

1553
01:28:47,551 --> 01:28:49,849
We always knew you had it in you.

1554
01:28:49,954 --> 01:28:51,820
Yea! Wendy for president!

1555
01:28:58,929 --> 01:28:59,896
Well, girls,

1556
01:28:59,997 --> 01:29:01,829
I think it's time we get going.

1557
01:29:01,932 --> 01:29:04,367
Let's take another shot
at that paperboy.

1558
01:29:04,468 --> 01:29:05,958
Sorry.

1559
01:29:06,070 --> 01:29:08,334
The judges won't accept
that answer.

1560
01:29:08,439 --> 01:29:09,838
Oh, sorry, Wendy.

1561
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:12,238
On your brooms.
To the air.

1562
01:29:12,343 --> 01:29:13,208
Wendy, wait.

1563
01:29:20,184 --> 01:29:22,118
So, you're leaving, huh?

1564
01:29:22,219 --> 01:29:23,277
Us, too.

1565
01:29:23,387 --> 01:29:26,220
Guess this is good-bye.

1566
01:29:26,323 --> 01:29:29,020
Yeah, I guess.

1567
01:29:29,126 --> 01:29:31,891
Listen, I just wanted to say...

1568
01:29:31,996 --> 01:29:33,623
I'm really gonna miss you.

1569
01:29:35,032 --> 01:29:37,023
Next week
you'll save some other girl

1570
01:29:37,134 --> 01:29:38,624
from a swirling vortex of doom

1571
01:29:38,736 --> 01:29:40,397
and you'll forget all about me.

1572
01:29:42,006 --> 01:29:44,805
Hey we really shook
things up, didn't we?

1573
01:29:44,909 --> 01:29:48,106
From now on, people are going
to treat us differently

1574
01:29:48,212 --> 01:29:49,543
Maybe.

1575
01:29:54,985 --> 01:29:57,215
Don't worry, they will.

1576
01:30:01,025 --> 01:30:02,322
Let's go.

1577
01:30:02,426 --> 01:30:03,689
Good-bye, Ghost boy.

1578
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:07,721
1, 2, 3, away!

1579
01:30:19,677 --> 01:30:23,614
No, no, no,
Junior Counselors-In-Training,

1580
01:30:23,714 --> 01:30:24,977
you've gotta hold
the bar level

1581
01:30:25,082 --> 01:30:26,675
so that guests
can get under it.

1582
01:30:26,784 --> 01:30:29,515
You two born yesterday?

1583
01:30:29,620 --> 01:30:30,849
You know, after this guy,

1584
01:30:30,955 --> 01:30:32,719
I'm beginning
to miss Desmond.

1585
01:30:32,823 --> 01:30:34,382
Ah, it's a living.

1586
01:30:37,328 --> 01:30:38,625
Yeah.

1587
01:30:38,729 --> 01:30:42,597
You know, I really like
doing Casper's chores,

1588
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:44,099
don't you? It's fun.

1589
01:30:44,201 --> 01:30:45,760
It's helpful.

1590
01:30:45,870 --> 01:30:48,100
It's been a hard day's night.

1591
01:30:48,197 --> 01:30:50,598
So long,
Sunny Brite Resort.

1592
01:30:50,708 --> 01:30:52,338
It's been real...

1593
01:30:52,416 --> 01:30:53,612
friendly.
