00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:06,651
Goethe saw that it was Faust's
relentless search for objectives...

2
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:09,490
In the end, Faust was saved
because he ceaselessly strove...

3
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,257
for the goal he had never obtained.

4
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,541
That's very good, Mrs. Gardner.

5
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,007
"Go to night school." It's very good.

6
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,519
There's only one thing wrong.
It's the word "night."

7
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:44,284
I know it sounds like N-l-T-E.
But we spell it...

8
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:48,851
N-l-G-H-T.

9
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,555
Night. Okay?

10
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:01,006
I can never get that one word, that "school."

11
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,003
- That's wrong, isn't it?
- Yeah.

12
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:09,510
It's S-C-H-O-O-L, Charly, not S-K.

13
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,645
S-C-H-O-O-L.

14
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:19,423
Okay, everybody.
Next Wednesday, we study through Page 20.

15
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,725
Good night.

16
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,835
I should like you to work very hard.

17
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:39,605
Whenever you can...
You must come next Wednesday.

18
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,944
- Every week, okay?
- Thank you very much.

19
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,911
Good night, Miss Kinnian.

20
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,214
Charly, we missed you.

21
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,045
At the clinic.
The doctors wanted to do some tests.

22
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,114
Yeah. Well, I forgot.

23
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:56,150
I went to the library.
I've never seen so many books in my life.

24
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:59,728
Don't forget the clinic tomorrow night.

25
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,895
No. I'm gonna write it down
on my blackboard twice, I promise.

26
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,931
- Good night.
- Good night, Miss Kinnian.

27
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,408
Hello, darling. Thanks for waiting for me.

28
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,003
Good night.

29
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:21,313
For instance, apples and pears.

30
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,753
They're both alike
because they're both fruit.

31
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,053
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

32
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:30,023
Okay, we'll begin. Shoes and gloves.

33
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,729
Charly, shoes and gloves.

34
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,231
- My rabbit's foot.
- That's good, Charly.

35
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,766
Shoes...

36
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,635
Shoes, gloves.

37
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,379
Shoes and gloves.

38
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,649
- You wear them.
- That's right.

39
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,916
Airplane, automobile.

40
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:02,792
Airplane...

41
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,463
Automobile.

42
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,197
You ride in them.

43
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,373
Morning, afternoon.

44
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:35,818
Charly, you don't have to worry
about passing or failing. Not these tests.

45
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:50,002
That's a very funny face, Charly.

46
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,802
Charly, I'm going to
show you some pictures.

47
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,581
Look at me.

48
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:04,013
What happened in this picture?
What do you see?

49
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,420
- Is there something missing?
- No.

50
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,293
I want you to make up a story
about these people.

51
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,599
I can't make up a story...

52
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:23,199
- About people I don't know, Miss Kinnian.
- Yes, you can.

53
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,303
You can make-believe.

54
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,511
Make up a story.

55
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,050
Is that a family?

56
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,215
That's a family.

57
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,291
Who is this?

58
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:49,091
- That's a father.
- Right.

59
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,504
If that is the father, then who is this?

60
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,999
That's a mother.

61
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,946
If that is the mother...

62
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,354
Do you remember your mother?

63
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,959
Yeah, sometimes I remember her.

64
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:22,961
I think I remember her.
Sitting on the edge of a bed...

65
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:29,167
putting her hand on my head and saying,
"He's burning up."

66
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,946
But, then, maybe...

67
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,710
that was a woman at the institute,
I don't know.

68
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:42,276
Probably a woman at the institute.

69
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:23,921
Charly!

70
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,766
It's 5:00, Charly.
Forgot what you have to do?

71
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,038
Finish the floor.

72
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:39,476
Come on, Charly, think.
You were gonna take something home.

73
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,513
Yeah.

74
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,149
For a minute there, Charly,
you had me worried.

75
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,550
You're always thinking such deep thoughts.

76
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,920
How you gonna remember a little thing
like your landlady's birthday?

77
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,319
Yeah, Mrs. Apple is gonna be real happy.

78
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:58,124
And thanks for making me remember, Gimp.

79
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,699
What are pals for, Charly?

80
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,599
Give me the broom.
Me and the boys will help you clean up.

81
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,034
- Right, fellas?
- Right!

82
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,867
Come on, Charly.

83
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,998
Gimp, what gives?

84
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:12,567
We filled his pail with raw dough
this morning, full of yeast.

85
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:06,895
It growed. It got big.

86
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,934
It growed. It got big.

87
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:36,357
Yeah, Charly again.
He has a marvelous opportunity.

88
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,431
Is that a him or a her?

89
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:45,493
- We call him Algernon.
- Algernon.

90
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:50,274
- Please, set up Number Four.
- All right. You can take it away now.

91
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,834
Now, you come, Charly,
and I'll show you something.

92
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,741
Okay, dear. See you at 9:00. Bye.

93
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,250
Doctor, why are you using the mouse test?

94
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:08,350
We're simply using a laboratory animal,
Mrs. Kinnian...

95
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,392
to spur the subject on to his best effort.

96
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:17,531
Now you and Algernon
are going to run a race.

97
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:22,305
Well, I can beat him
'cause I'm bigger than he is.

98
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,171
It's not that kind of race.

99
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:29,046
- Charly, what does this look like?
- It's a puzzle.

100
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,651
Very good, that's right. Now watch.

101
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:37,413
We put Algernon in here to start.

102
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:42,257
Then we put some food in here,
at the finish.

103
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:47,426
And Algernon knows
he must find his way through the puzzle...

104
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,660
if he wants to get the food.

105
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,998
- And if he don't?
- Then he doesn't get to eat it.

106
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:56,433
He don't?

107
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,276
Don't worry, Charly. He won't go hungry.

108
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,168
Now, Charly...

109
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:05,781
this is a diagram.

110
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:10,585
Diagram? It's exactly the same
as Algernon's puzzle.

111
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:15,687
You'll take this pencil and draw...

112
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:21,294
from the start to the finish...

113
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,195
without going through any of the lines.

114
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:28,169
You'll start at the same time
Algernon does...

115
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,698
and we'll see who gets through first.

116
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,103
Do you understand, Charly?

117
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:49,854
Ready?

118
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,058
Start.

119
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,488
Very good.

120
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,300
He beat me.

121
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,539
He beat me. I didn't know mice are so smart.

122
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,655
Come on, Charly, cheer up.

123
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,025
How would you feel
if you was dumber than a mouse?

124
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,422
Good night, Miss Kinnian.

125
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:11,036
Charly, aren't you gonna ask me up?

126
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,635
I've never once seen your apartment.

127
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,377
I'd like to see it.

128
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,484
- Well, it's just a room.
- It doesn't matter.

129
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,556
It's upstairs.

130
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,608
Can you imagine, Monty?

131
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,885
Charly Gordon with a girl.

132
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,585
He better have her out by 10:00.

133
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,125
There will be no hokey-pokey in my house.

134
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:18,201
- It's just a room, Miss Kinnian.
- It's very nice.

135
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,758
Who are they?

136
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:40,722
That's Gimpy and the guys at the bakery.
They are my best friends.

137
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,730
Charly, may I have a glass of water, please?

138
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,801
Yeah. Would you...

139
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:55,306
- Would you like a soda pop?
- Yeah. That will be fine.

140
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,842
- How about you?
- No, that's okay.

141
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,756
- Would you like to sit down?
- Yeah, I would.

142
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,319
Grab a chair.

143
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,102
Thank you.

144
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,077
I'll sit in this chair.

145
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,606
It's little, but it's good.

146
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,985
I had a radio but it got busted.

147
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,254
- Charly?
- Yeah?

148
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,093
Can you keep a secret?

149
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:24,460
Yeah. I'm a good secret keeper.

150
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,233
That mouse you raced today.

151
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,969
Yeah, that Algernon.

152
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,474
He was very special.

153
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,809
He had an operation.

154
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,817
When it was over, he was smarter.

155
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,946
The doctors are ready
to try that operation on a man.

156
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,281
They're ready to choose someone now.

157
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,351
That's why you had all those tests.

158
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:54,265
Well, they should have told me.
I would have tried harder.

159
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,700
- Would you like an operation like that?
- Yeah.

160
00:18:58,904 --> 00:18:59,962
Why?

161
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,833
I'd like to be smarter...

162
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,471
so that I could understand Gimpy
and the fellas at the bakery.

163
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,911
There's a lot of their words
I don't understand.

164
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:21,250
Just so I could get a little closer, you know.

165
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,926
I think we can get you
to race Algernon again.

166
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,138
I don't know.

167
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,908
Algernon is a smart little mouse.

168
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,505
Ready now? Start.

169
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:17,174
Take it easy. You ready? Start.

170
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,012
Well, here are the results.

171
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:22,520
His Performance IQ is 59...

172
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:26,215
Verbal 69, Full Scale 70.

173
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,890
Too low, at least for our first subject.

174
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,691
We have other retardates...

175
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:37,758
who might be more suitable.

176
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,733
I've never met one
who has Charly's motivation.

177
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:45,673
He came all by himself for two years
to night school...

178
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,939
to try to improve his reading.

179
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,474
That's all very well, Mrs. Kinnian.
But I think...

180
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:55,350
Isn't it true that the average retardate
is overly sensitive and sometimes hostile?

181
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,247
In Charly's working environment...

182
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:02,691
he is the butt of all kinds of jokes,
some of them cruel...

183
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,060
yet he always remains
cheerful and pleasant.

184
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:09,334
The fact remains he's a grown man.

185
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:14,127
Doctor, is the operation dangerous?

186
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:17,937
It need not involve
any unusual surgical risk.

187
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:22,071
It's the postoperative period
we're concerned about.

188
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,807
The younger our subject...

189
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:29,081
the less complicated
his emotional adjustment is apt to be.

190
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:33,950
There is one point in Charly's favor.

191
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:36,956
Mrs. Kinnian.

192
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:41,765
Whoever we decide on will have to be
put in an accelerated learning program.

193
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,097
He'll need a full-time teacher.

194
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,998
Somebody with Mrs. Kinnian's background,
even more important...

195
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,168
someone he trusts.

196
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,008
Would you be available?

197
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:56,180
My fiance and I were planning to work...

198
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,580
on a joint thesis for our doctorates.

199
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:02,281
Well, at the moment,
it's all hypothetical anyway.

200
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:04,853
Of course.

201
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,927
- Thank you, Mrs. Kinnian.
- Thank you, Doctor.

202
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:21,332
Come on, Charly. Let's go.

203
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,874
Yeah, just one more, Miss Kinnian.

204
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,511
Not quite.

205
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,217
You sure are a smart mouse, Algernon.

206
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,450
Good night, Bert.

207
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,186
- Good night, Bert.
- Take it easy, Charly.

208
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,558
Good night, Algernon.

209
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:11,153
That Father Callahan now. Take him, Monty.

210
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:14,421
He's one of that new breed of liberal priests.

211
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,028
It's no wonder the younger generation
are selling their souls to the devil.

212
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:02,701
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the historical tour of Boston.

213
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:06,676
This is the Charles River Basin where
amateur yachtsmen can sail 365 days a year.

214
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,942
In the late afternoon,
you can see the sculling crews of Harvard...

215
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:13,212
MIT, and other universities,
practicing for their annual races.

216
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:17,745
On the left is the Prudential Center.
The Prudential Tower, 52 stories high...

217
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:20,656
is the tallest building
in the continental United States...

218
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:25,059
if you consider Manhattan Island
outside the continental United States.

219
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:27,994
Here's Bunker Hill Monument.

220
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:31,365
Stands 220 feet tall,
30 square feet at the bottom...

221
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:35,167
15 at the top, 294 winding stairs.

222
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,100
It'll take you approximately 2o minutes
to walk up, 15 minutes to come down...

223
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,638
and 10 days to get over it.

224
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:47,680
The Boston-Cambridge area has a total
of 189 universities and small colleges.

225
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,513
We are now going through
Boston University...

226
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:54,025
which includes a School of Law,
a School of Political Science...

227
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:57,061
a School of Philosophy,
a School of Accounting...

228
00:24:57,128 --> 00:25:00,757
a School of Nursing,
a School of Business Administration...

229
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,665
a School of Fine Arts, and many others.

230
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,570
As we make a right-hand turn,
look to your left.

231
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:10,870
You'll see the Boston Public Library.
The third oldest library in America.

232
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:14,276
There's over 2 million volumes
in its collection.

233
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:17,944
On your far left is the Old South Church.

234
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,877
As we make a right-hand turn
on Boston Street, look to your right.

235
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:24,945
You will see Trinity Church,
founded in 1877...

236
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,990
designed by Henry Hobson Richardson.

237
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:31,290
Phillip Brooks was pastor of this church
for 22 consecutive years.

238
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:35,121
While being pastor,
he was made Bishop of Massachusetts.

239
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,068
Most of you people remember Phillip Brooks
by his famous church hymns.

240
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:43,937
One of the most famous Christmas carols,
O Little Town of Bethlehem.

241
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:49,242
We'll make a brief stop in South Boston,
to discharge a passenger.

242
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,946
- See you next Sunday, Charly.
- Okay.

243
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:20,605
- Come on, Charly, just one beer.
- No, I can't. Not tonight, Gimp.

244
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:24,547
- I bet you're gonna see that school teacher.
- Boy, could I give her a lesson.

245
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,551
- I didn't think you went for broads.
- Sure I do.

246
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,450
What do you do with her?

247
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,887
I promised her. I can't talk about it.

248
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,187
What do you mean
you can't talk about it, Charly?

249
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,193
- Ain't I your best buddy?
- Sure you are.

250
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:40,561
- What's the big mystery?
- I promised her. I can't talk about it.

251
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:45,331
- Charly, I'm disappointed in you.
- Don't be mad at me, Gimp.

252
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:48,702
So come on over and have a beer.
Just a little beer.

253
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:50,733
Okay.

254
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,139
- Charly, how about playing a little music?
- Yeah, okay.

255
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:59,775
- I've got it here.
- Hold it, Hank.

256
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:04,015
- Charly's got lots of dough. Right, Charly?
- Yeah, I save my dough.

257
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,990
I bet you got a bundle
tucked under the mattress.

258
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,151
What do you save it for, Charly?

259
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:11,661
- Well, I don't know. Something.
- What?

260
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:16,465
- So blow two bits, Charly?
- Yeah.

261
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,502
Watch this.

262
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,351
Charly, what did you do to it?
Drop a slug in?

263
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:50,093
No, I put a quarter in there, Gimp.
A real quarter.

264
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,626
Talk to the juke, Charly, like you always do.

265
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,998
Yeah, okay.

266
00:27:57,075 --> 00:28:00,169
Juke, I put a quarter in there,
and you better play. Do you hear?

267
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:03,772
Charly, Juke don't like to be scolded.

268
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,740
Juke likes a nice, sweet tone of voice.

269
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:12,320
Okay, Juke.

270
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:17,418
You're a nice juke and you got nice lights,
and you're real nice.

271
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:26,127
- Come on back here, champ.
- We knew you could do it.

272
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,372
- Charly, you hear it's liable to snow tonight?
- I don't know. I didn't hear that, Gimp.

273
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,775
That's what they say. I'll tell you what.

274
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:37,679
How about stopping off at the corner of
Manning and Standish on your way home?

275
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:41,150
- Okay, what do I do there?
- I'll tell you, Charly.

276
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,551
A lot of people don't know this.

277
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,981
But I'm gonna let you in on it.

278
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:50,153
That's where the snow always starts. Yeah.

279
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:53,492
Right there on the corner
where Manning runs into Standish.

280
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,795
Now you wait there for a while...

281
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:59,860
and when that first flake comes down,
you give us a call.

282
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:04,432
That way we get to get home in time
before it really starts coming down.

283
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:06,807
- Okay, Charly?
- Yeah.

284
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,839
Who do I call?

285
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,848
Paddy, give Charles one of your cards.

286
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,021
- Better get started, Charly.
- Yeah.

287
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,922
None of that now.

288
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,624
I guess I can afford to buy a beer
for good old Charly.

289
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,221
All right.

290
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:29,862
Go get them, tiger, go get them.

291
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,332
So long, pal. See you later.

292
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,207
Well, here's to a blizzard.

293
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:55,417
Buddy, what you doing?

294
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,356
What you doing?

295
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,028
Waiting for it to snow.

296
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,197
Let's go.

297
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,864
Stupid.

298
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,650
The operation.

299
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:43,255
- The operation?
- Yes.

300
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,201
- I made it?
- Yes.

301
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,209
I made it!

302
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,018
- Miss Kinnian?
- Yes.

303
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:16,860
I don't feel no smarter.

304
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,132
Ready? Start.

305
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,473
Again, Charly.

306
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,713
Again. Try.

307
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:19,483
Please.

308
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,060
How did the lessons go tonight?

309
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:28,220
- Just one more...
- I keep doing it again and...

310
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,526
But try it, Charly.

311
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:32,967
Post-surgical recovery is complete.

312
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:43,708
These five mice, look at their mental curve.

313
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:48,776
He's shown no comparable
intellectual progress.

314
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:50,450
No.

315
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:52,546
Charly, I know that you can do it.

316
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:55,148
I know that I can't do it, Doctor.

317
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:58,195
Yesterday, and the day before,
you keep saying I can do it...

318
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,493
and Miss Kinnian says I can do it,
everybody says I can do it...

319
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,261
but I know I can't do it.

320
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:06,428
- But we know you can do it.
- I know I can't do it.

321
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:15,636
Charly, try. It makes a lovely, nice figure.

322
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:18,841
I can't do it, Dr. Straus,
you know I can't do it.

323
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:21,714
I know I can't do it, and I don't want to do it.

324
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,819
- I can't learn nothing.
- Charly!

325
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:29,053
- Did that operation make me dumber?
- Nothing of the sort.

326
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,290
I can't do any of the puzzles,
and I'll tell you something else.

327
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:36,163
I ain't racing that Algernon no more.
I'm sick of being beaten by a mouse...

328
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,930
- And people laughing at me.
- Nobody is laughing at you.

329
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:41,870
I don't care! I'm going out of here, now!

330
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:49,068
"My name is Dick. I live in a house.

331
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:53,773
"I have a sister named Jane
and a dog named Spot."

332
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,550
My name is Charly Gordon,
and I live in a room...

333
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:03,781
and I got no sister, no dog, and I am stupid!

334
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:14,153
And what are you doing here?

335
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:27,437
I ain't gonna race you.

336
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:33,780
I know why they brought you over here,
but I ain't gonna race you.

337
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,512
'Cause I don't like you. You're not my friend!

338
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:41,149
Charly Gordon.
Do you have a girl in your room?

339
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:42,817
No, it's a him!

340
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,023
Charly Gordon.

341
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,363
It's a mouse.

342
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,793
Young man, there are no mice in this house.

343
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:53,962
There's one in my room.
They brought him over in a cage.

344
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:55,801
But I ain't gonna race him.

345
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,572
Cage. Charly.

346
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,079
I've been meaning to talk to you.

347
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:05,445
Could you step in here, please?

348
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:11,077
Monty. That nice Charly Gordon
is coming to visit.

349
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,855
You say, a cage. A pet mouse?

350
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:22,628
Yeah, but I ain't gonna race him.

351
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,668
Come in here for a minute.

352
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,203
Sit down, Charly.

353
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,804
Don't sit on Monty.

354
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:36,572
Sit down, Charly.

355
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,389
- Charly.
- Yeah.

356
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,860
Having a pet is a gift from God.

357
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:56,193
- Isn't that right, Monty?
- I don't know, Miss Apple.

358
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:59,168
Don't argue with me, young man.
I'm telling you.

359
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:03,138
This little mouse is a blessing in disguise.

360
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:06,769
First of all, a pet keeps you company.

361
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,041
They don't talk back.

362
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:12,011
They're loyal and loving.

363
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:14,547
They are truly man's best friend.

364
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:20,151
A little animal is one of God's creatures.

365
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:23,720
They live only to comfort you.

366
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:30,193
Now, Charly, you go right back up there,
and you make up with him.

367
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,796
Tell him you'll feed him...

368
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:35,464
clean his cage and give him water.

369
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,398
That's all he wants. That, and your love.

370
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:43,803
And in return,
he'll give you many happy hours.

371
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,614
Monty, why don't we give Charly...

372
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,813
one of your bones,
to give to the little mouse?

373
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,082
Would you mind?

374
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,929
I don't know if mice
are carnivorous or vegetarious.

375
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,402
Anyway, Charly, here you are.

376
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:12,272
- What are you going to call him?
- They call him Algernon.

377
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:18,906
You and Algernon are welcome down here
at any time.

378
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,913
Thank you, Miss Apple.

379
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,591
Algernon.

380
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:31,217
What do you think of that, Montgomery?

381
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,481
Hi, Alg.

382
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:37,652
Wanna race?

383
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:03,673
You ready, pal?

384
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:10,980
Go.

385
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,769
I beat you.

386
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,614
I beat him!

387
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:08,039
I beat him!

388
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:22,686
Professor, Dr. Straus, Miss Kinnian!
I beat him!

389
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:25,623
Charly!

390
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:28,562
Miss Kinnian, I beat him.

391
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,636
I was in the room... They put...
Somebody... A mouse...

392
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:35,331
I got the wrapper, and I spelt "school."

393
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:39,167
I put him, and I beat him.

394
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,107
I creamed him!

395
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:46,839
Miss Kinnian, what happens now?

396
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,768
Punctuate it.

397
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,235
Go ahead, punctuate it.

398
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:36,359
Now, I got something all made up for you
to punctuate.

399
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:44,030
Punctuate that.

400
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,476
That does not make sense.

401
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:03,057
"That, that is...

402
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:05,119
"is.

403
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:08,193
"That, that is not...

404
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,166
"is not."

405
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:13,596
"Is that it?"

406
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,233
"It is."

407
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:26,411
Student surpasses the teacher.

408
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,979
- Mrs. Kinnian.
- Yes.

409
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:37,090
Where's Mr. Kinnian?

410
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,193
He died.

411
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:45,961
Are you in love with Frank?

412
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:54,204
Tomorrow's studies.

413
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:56,639
Basic chemistry.

414
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:04,143
- Good night, Charly.
- Good night, Miss Kinnian.

415
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:18,092
This is the Capitol of the United States.

416
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,898
Our government is divided
into three branches.

417
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:24,338
The Executive, the Legislative,
and the Judicial.

418
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:28,002
What are the two legislative branches
of Congress called?

419
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:30,603
Turn off the teaching machine to answer.

420
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:37,381
House of Representatives and Senate.

421
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:48,497
You are looking at a film of one of
our country's most significant events.

422
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:51,056
Who are these men? Why are they here?

423
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:54,934
What did they do almost 2oo years ago,
that affects your life today?

424
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:59,271
Those men are getting ready...

425
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:03,973
to sign the Declaration of Independence,
and declare our country...

426
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:07,214
free from England.

427
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,948
And I'm getting ready for work.

428
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:50,524
- Hey, Charly.
- Yeah?

429
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,495
- You know what day it is?
- I don't know, Gimp.

430
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,399
We aren't keeping you awake, are we?

431
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:59,060
Is it that chick? Just won't let you alone?

432
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:02,902
- It's April Fools' Day. That's what day it is.
- His birthday.

433
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:09,470
The English Constitution.

434
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:12,947
- Hey, Gimp.
- Yeah?

435
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:16,850
- You know what a Magna Carta is?
- That's a cigar, isn't it?

436
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,710
Come on, Hank. I need that.

437
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:24,724
You really know all this stuff in here?
Or are you just looking at pictures?

438
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:26,757
I know some of it.

439
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:29,825
Hell, Charly, you're so smart that...

440
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:33,127
Yeah, why not. Here.

441
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,795
- See this machine?
- Yeah.

442
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:39,706
- You know what it is?
- It's a machine that you work.

443
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,710
How would you like to work it?

444
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:45,245
- Gimp, you kidding?
- What do you mean, kidding, Joey?

445
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,249
Man knows what the Magna Carta is.

446
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:50,286
He'd be able to operate
a simple machine like a pastry mixer.

447
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:54,381
It took you two weeks learning how.
That's a very complicated machine.

448
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:58,394
Not for Charly. Come in here closer.

449
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:01,920
Look, this is all you got to do.
Step number one.

450
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,399
You turn on your water. See?

451
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:07,301
Make sure the temperature
is 78 degrees, okay?

452
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:11,603
Then we come over here
and set our water pressure at 1 40 pounds.

453
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,302
See that, right there.

454
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:16,846
Set it back and turn on the water switch.

455
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:18,403
You got this now, right?

456
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:22,885
Now we follow our fresh water
along that line to that valve, see?

457
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:25,513
Excuse me, Joey. I wanna get up there.

458
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,386
We come up here...

459
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:31,352
and we open up our flour hopper.
Lets our flour down here.

460
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:35,387
You mix it with the water, okay?
Come over here.

461
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:37,296
Open up our bowl.

462
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:40,494
I want you to get a look at this dough.

463
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:45,132
Then we start up our agitator.
This stirs up the dough inside.

464
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,301
Okay, see it? All right.

465
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,106
Then we close it up.

466
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:55,112
Now comes a very important thing.
These timing switches.

467
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:59,519
Set your timing switches.
They're very important. Don't forget these.

468
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:06,789
Now, Charly, you put all this together,
and it comes out dough.

469
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:10,260
- What do you say?
- I don't know.

470
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:15,135
- Suppose he breaks it?
- Then we get the day off.

471
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:17,002
April Fools' Day.

472
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:18,935
Watch it!

473
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,214
Watch Charly.

474
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,389
- Charly, that was perfect.
- Great. I love that.

475
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:43,551
You couldn't have done better than that.

476
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:05,944
Mrs. Kinnian. Come here, quick.

477
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:10,444
There's a whole new world in it. Look at it.

478
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,545
- It's exciting?
- Yeah.

479
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:20,059
Let's see if you can identify...

480
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:23,364
the activity in each of these slides.

481
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:39,010
Is he in love with you?

482
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,178
Frank.

483
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:51,486
I'd rather not discuss my personal life,
if you don't mind.

484
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:57,025
Not that there is anything secret about it
or even unusual.

485
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,796
It has nothing to do
with your program of learning.

486
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:04,067
- First slide.
- I got a birthday present.

487
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:07,805
- It's not my birthday.
- It's not for you.

488
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:10,175
Algernon.

489
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:13,179
It's his birthday cheese.

490
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:17,311
What makes you think it's his birthday?

491
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,147
How do you know it's not?

492
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:24,627
That's true. Happy birthday, Algernon.

493
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:27,887
Happy birthday, Algernon.

494
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:32,328
It's very nice of you, Charly.

495
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:35,701
Well, he's very special.

496
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:55,624
Nice paintings. Now, Judy, what...

497
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:58,922
I painted a house.

498
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:01,589
Isn't that nice, dear?

499
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:05,863
And what is your... Mrs. Kinnian.

500
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:08,129
That's nice that you came.

501
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:11,605
Dean, would you be good enough
and go over to Cathy?

502
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:15,533
Play with the pumpkins.
You can sit down, Mrs. Kinnian.

503
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,175
Would you do it, Dean, please?

504
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:23,913
Thank you so much. Thanks a lot.
That's nice what you've painted, Dean.

505
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:29,621
- Look what I made.
- It's so bright.

506
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:32,992
I got your letter, Mrs. Kinnian.

507
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:37,356
I'm afraid I can't accept your reasons.

508
00:55:37,534 --> 00:55:39,627
I'm holding him back.

509
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:42,831
He knows the answers and questions
before I even open the book.

510
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:44,931
- And?
- And what?

511
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:50,338
You seem tense. Is it that important
for you to resign from this project?

512
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:52,313
I gave you my reasons.

513
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:55,808
Which I must reject. You are a psychologist.

514
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:58,547
You know that Charly has made
a transference...

515
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:01,920
and at this point,
is completely dependant upon you.

516
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,661
He's involved with you emotionally.

517
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:10,027
That's normal, isn't it?

518
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:16,665
And you are involved with him emotionally?

519
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,637
Why do you ask that?

520
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:24,071
- I am engaged, you know.
- I met your fiance.

521
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:28,015
Very charming.
How long have you been engaged?

522
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:32,178
I'll stay until the convention, Doctor.

523
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:33,720
No longer.

524
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:39,994
I've got to go.

525
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:43,625
Bye-bye.

526
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:47,834
- Bye.
- Bye-bye, Mrs. Kinnian.

527
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:17,459
Faneuil Hall. Built in the early 1 7 40s...

528
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:20,765
and given to the city by the merchant
Peter Faneuil.

529
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:24,432
It burned in 1 761 but was rebuilt.

530
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:27,874
It's still in use as a market, a meeting place.

531
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,578
Why is it known as the Cradle of Liberty?

532
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:54,931
If we'd walked in there, say in 1 77 4...

533
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:58,201
whom might we have met
attending a meeting of protest?

534
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:02,340
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

535
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:08,415
The next stop along the Freedom Trail
is the North Church.

536
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,715
Built 1 723.

537
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:13,984
Boston's oldest church.

538
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:18,488
For what historic incident
is North Church known?

539
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:23,097
I'm sorry, I didn't...

540
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:27,627
What happened here that became part
of our national heritage?

541
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:31,036
Two lanterns in the steeple
signaled Paul Revere...

542
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:33,735
that British were on their way to Concord.

543
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:36,907
Right. Any questions?

544
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:40,909
I was wondering why people...

545
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:44,078
that would never dream
of laughing at a blind or crippled man...

546
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:46,087
would laugh at a moron.

547
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:54,853
What happened?

548
00:58:56,432 --> 00:58:59,799
My friends at the bakery got up a petition,
and I got fired.

549
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:09,672
Is that an automatic law,
something like gravity?

550
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:14,081
Increased intelligence equals lost friends.

551
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:19,654
You needn't worry about losing your job.

552
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,657
The doctors want you to work full-time
at the clinic...

553
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:25,956
studying, learning, and getting paid, too.

554
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:29,925
Will you be there all the time?

555
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:33,697
Yes. I imagine so.

556
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:36,502
At least until the convention.

557
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,973
The doctors have been asked
to head a symposium.

558
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:42,101
The annual meeting of the
Society for Cerebral Research.

559
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:45,773
I suspect you and Algernon
are scheduled to be their prime exhibits.

560
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:48,279
What will we have to do?

561
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:51,844
Maybe speak a foreign language...

562
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,583
do an exercise in neo-Boolean math.

563
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:56,719
Both of us?

564
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,788
George Bernard Shaw wrote
something once...

565
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:04,355
Pass the ketchup, please.

566
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:07,392
- I didn't know he wrote that.
- What?

567
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:09,061
Pass The Ketchup, Please.

568
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:11,402
- Here's your chowder, sir.
- It's the lady's.

569
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:12,702
No, seriously.

570
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:14,134
Thank you.

571
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:17,974
He said, "Whenever you learn something,
it seems at first...

572
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,208
"as if you've lost something."

573
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:25,484
A whole universe is opening up for you.

574
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:28,620
It's a world that's always been there...

575
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:32,084
but not for you. Not till now.

576
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,096
Cream, please.

577
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:39,197
Now you're growing,
and growth causes pain.

578
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:41,327
You do your job very well.

579
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,634
Bert, please.

580
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:52,980
Are you quite certain of your evaluation
of Charly's Rorschach tests?

581
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:55,846
There's no question in my opinion.

582
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:58,412
Thank you.

583
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:09,095
Once the initial breakthrough occurred...

584
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:12,862
subject completed all elementary
school work in five weeks.

585
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:18,437
A capacity speed-up occurred
during the high school phase.

586
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:21,102
And all this work was accomplished
in three weeks.

587
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:23,075
Instructions were then accelerated.

588
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:25,239
You have been pushing him much too hard.

589
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:29,580
Subject made the leap from rote
memorization to a grasp of abstract theory.

590
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:34,688
The next step was attaining insightful
function and the ability to restructure.

591
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:36,616
- Subsequently...
- Richard.

592
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,923
May I please have your attention?

593
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:41,626
Emotionally, he's still a child.

594
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:45,026
Frightened. Insecure.

595
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:49,270
Look at these drawings...

596
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,467
I've had him do.

597
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:57,542
They are representative of the last...

598
01:01:58,748 --> 01:01:59,908
two months.

599
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:05,283
- Each one progressively more disturbed.
- Disturbed?

600
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:08,985
He likes to paint.

601
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:13,987
He still can't believe he's being paid to do
nothing but learn, paint, and improve.

602
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:16,260
But can't you see?

603
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,625
I cautioned you about this before.

604
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:25,531
These aren't disturbed.
They are more sophisticated.

605
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:29,740
More abstract than the ones he did
a couple of months ago.

606
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:32,941
You go right on ignoring even the evidence.

607
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:35,776
Come.

608
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:45,490
Anna, I don't think we should interrupt
his studies.

609
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:53,194
Thymine, guanine and cytosine.

610
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:56,705
Structure of the insulin molecule.

611
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,531
Double-chain, 51 amino acids...

612
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:03,204
employing 17 basic aminos
cross-linked by sulfur atoms.

613
01:03:04,046 --> 01:03:06,913
What metal and what gas
would you combine...

614
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:11,044
- In order to convert heat into...
- Electricity? Tantalum and cesium vapor.

615
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:12,812
Yes.

616
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:15,824
What is the technique called
the algebra of...

617
01:03:18,027 --> 01:03:20,120
What are you trying to turn him into?

618
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:23,726
- Some kind of side-show freak?
- Don't be ridiculous.

619
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,896
You're pushing your program for his
intellectual development too rapidly.

620
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:31,804
It has to keep pace with my program
for his emotional development...

621
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:34,900
or the imbalance will become dangerous.

622
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:38,205
I thought we were to be satisfied
with a minor miracle...

623
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:41,045
- What are you afraid of?
...help a retarded human being...

624
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:43,312
become a more productive member
of society.

625
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:46,150
He has shown no indication
of any mental ceiling.

626
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:49,749
So why are you afraid to reach
for whatever that ceiling may be?

627
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:54,222
In any event, we shall have to give
Mrs. Kinnian her notice.

628
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:57,224
What?

629
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:02,430
All she can do now is ask him questions
out of books that he's already absorbed.

630
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:05,338
What he needs at this point
is a giant step forward.

631
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:08,434
New conceptualization. Inductive thinking.

632
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:11,880
That calls for experts, not Alice Kinnian.

633
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:15,041
I will say it once more, Richard.

634
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:19,651
Charly Gordon is still a child emotionally.

635
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:21,913
I don't agree.

636
01:04:57,159 --> 01:04:58,285
Yes?

637
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:03,121
Charly, what is it?

638
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,868
I brought you a present.

639
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:11,234
Okay, come in.

640
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,443
Very nice of you.

641
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,748
What's the occasion?

642
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:25,314
I just wanted you to have a present.

643
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:28,016
Sit down.

644
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:51,170
Lovely paper.

645
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:57,110
Charly, it's so beautiful.

646
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:02,049
Must have been terribly expensive.

647
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:04,991
You like it?

648
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:08,362
It's beautiful but it's too much.

649
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:12,630
Just beautiful. Thank you.

650
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:18,070
He only kissed you on the cheek.

651
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:22,369
He?

652
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:24,506
Frank.

653
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:34,781
Have you been spying on me?

654
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:38,483
I've been falling in love with you.

655
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:43,689
No.

656
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:51,232
These feelings aren't what you think.

657
01:06:52,942 --> 01:06:54,569
It isn't love...

658
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:58,112
We have fun working together...

659
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,671
but you have to understand that between...

660
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:40,113
You think anyone would ever want you?

661
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:42,851
You stupid moron!

662
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:43,373
I saw your cycle outside.

663
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:47,110
It's for sale.

664
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,488
What did you learn?

665
01:09:57,927 --> 01:09:58,916
I'm back.

666
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:03,598
What did you learn?

667
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:08,392
I'm here.

668
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:54,782
- Marry me, Alice.
- Charly...

669
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:58,281
I could never keep up with you,
and I don't want to hold you back.

670
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:01,585
- And I don't want to be left behind.
- Einstein had a wife.

671
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:03,751
Didn't Einstein say...

672
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:08,788
that everything was in motion,
that nothing ever stands still?

673
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,311
Marry me, pretty girl, marry me.

674
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:26,041
We will marry at quarter past Wednesday...

675
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:29,016
on the 7 4th of November...

676
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:33,547
and our anniversary will happily be...

677
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,151
on those days when we both remember.

678
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:52,140
Ever been anywhere?

679
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:55,505
Someday.

680
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:58,243
Portugal is straight ahead.

681
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:01,676
I can smell the olives.

682
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:06,146
Ship ahoy.

683
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:09,351
Abandoned schooner off the starboard bow.

684
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,125
Want to ship out?

685
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:15,024
Okay, where are the sails?

686
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:17,229
Who needs sails?

687
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:30,576
As captain of this ship,
I now declare us man and wife.

688
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:35,150
I signed on only as first mate.

689
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:51,457
You know what's going to happen
in the year 2o18?

690
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:54,665
I'm never gonna let this year end.

691
01:12:55,404 --> 01:12:57,702
It will be our golden wedding anniversary.

692
01:12:57,773 --> 01:13:00,207
Charly, let's worry about breakfast.

693
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:07,706
Think Algernon has found a wife?

694
01:13:08,784 --> 01:13:10,115
Or his true love.

695
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,447
The plural of mouse is mice.

696
01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:17,348
The plural of spouse must be spice?

697
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:26,734
They say, Charly...

698
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:29,001
that true love...

699
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:31,401
is letting go.

700
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:53,561
What's enough love?

701
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:57,763
Always a little more...

702
01:13:58,033 --> 01:13:59,625
than anyone ever gets.

703
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:12,574
Please, could we stop
these recriminations...

704
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:15,139
and use the time to decide
tomorrow's program?

705
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:17,515
All right, you still really believe
he'll be here?

706
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:20,646
But, of course. You were on the extension,
you heard them...

707
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:23,748
How do we know what's happened
to Charly in the past four weeks?

708
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:27,694
Whether he's learned more or not?
We have no immediate evaluation...

709
01:14:27,763 --> 01:14:30,664
May we concentrate on the presentation?

710
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:33,633
All right, what are your ideas
on the programming?

711
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:37,631
How much time shall we program
for Algernon and the Phase 5 mice?

712
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:43,033
I thought we agreed to eliminate
that part of the presentation.

713
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:47,073
No, I did not agree to that.

714
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:51,051
It is essential to show the entire graph
of Algernon's various stages.

715
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:54,987
In my opinion, we should
concentrate on Charly...

716
01:14:55,057 --> 01:14:57,685
the preoperative testing,
and then you cap it all off...

717
01:14:57,759 --> 01:14:59,226
by bringing him out on stage.

718
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:01,990
Why don't you just leave
the programming to me?

719
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:07,191
You know, sometimes you give me
the feeling you have already...

720
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:11,035
written your acceptance speech
for the ceremonies in Stockholm.

721
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:12,937
Bravo!

722
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:18,438
You made us lose a lot of valuable time.

723
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:21,108
Time, as you've often taught me, Professor,
is relative...

724
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:23,913
as it creeps on in its petty pace
from day to day.

725
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:27,820
- To the last syllable of recorded time.
- Edgar Allen Shakespeare.

726
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:31,189
- You both look happy!
- I have never felt happier.

727
01:15:31,426 --> 01:15:34,156
There were no telephones
where you were, Mrs. Kinnian...

728
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:36,060
no post offices until yesterday?

729
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:39,828
I didn't have a dime, I didn't have a stamp,
I didn't have the time!

730
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:42,166
She didn't have a dime, time,
or the inclination.

731
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:45,206
- Hi, Charly, Mrs. Kinnian!
- Bert, how are you? How's Algernon?

732
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:47,606
Last week he said hello to me in Sanskrit.

733
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:48,768
What did you say to him?

734
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:51,404
What do you say to a mouse
that says hello in Sanskrit?

735
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,708
I said hello!

736
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:55,383
Homecoming! We've still got
a little champagne left.

737
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:57,441
Champagne with a plastic top:

738
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,043
symbol of our times.

739
01:15:59,521 --> 01:16:03,617
Now that you're here,
I want to run over tomorrow's program.

740
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:05,522
Very well. What would you like...

741
01:16:05,594 --> 01:16:10,293
a treatise on photosynthesis and its effect
on fourth-generation computers?

742
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:13,926
By the way, how do your surgical
techniques work on retarded computers?

743
01:16:14,002 --> 01:16:15,594
And you, Dr. Straus...

744
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:19,069
what would you like for emotional effect?
Would you like...

745
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:23,241
an ideational activity or would you like
fragmented self-image?

746
01:16:23,545 --> 01:16:25,069
I would like a drink.

747
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:27,505
- Fragmented grape.
- Thank you.

748
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:31,547
Come on, Professor, cheer up.
After tomorrow...

749
01:16:32,187 --> 01:16:34,849
you're gonna be on the cover
of Time and Newsweek.

750
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:38,518
And you, Dr. Straus, are gonna be
in the centerfold of Playboy.

751
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:50,865
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor
at this time to present to you...

752
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:54,073
the distinguished Dr. Richard Nemur...

753
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:57,374
and his colleague, Dr. Anna Straus...

754
01:16:57,913 --> 01:17:01,110
who are responsible
for the Algernon-Gordon effect.

755
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:05,384
You are all acquainted with their
eminent qualifications...

756
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:06,921
through their published papers...

757
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:09,116
I told you we're not using
the Phase 5 group.

758
01:17:09,191 --> 01:17:10,658
I asked Bert to bring them.

759
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:13,889
Some of the behavioral psychologists
might care to see them.

760
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:15,088
Is that advisable?

761
01:17:15,163 --> 01:17:17,393
I think it is absolutely essential that...

762
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:20,697
Dr. Anna Straus and Dr. Richard Nemur.

763
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:41,345
Learned colleagues...

764
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:45,181
the presentation today will deal first...

765
01:17:45,927 --> 01:17:47,121
Give me a cigarette.

766
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:50,130
...aspects of the Algernon-Gordon effect...

767
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:53,524
which my associate will cover.

768
01:17:54,202 --> 01:17:55,692
- Thanks.
- I didn't know you smoked.

769
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:56,760
I don't.

770
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,029
Listen...

771
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:03,172
- There's absolutely no need to be nervous.
- No.

772
01:18:03,879 --> 01:18:07,747
There's only a few hundred of the world's
most eminent scientists out there.

773
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:10,614
- No reason to be nervous.
- Never mind about them.

774
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:14,587
- You are talking directly to me.
- Yes.

775
01:18:16,324 --> 01:18:19,054
Will you stand where I can see you?
Right there.

776
01:18:20,562 --> 01:18:21,551
Let me know.

777
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:24,030
...resulted in a maverick enzyme...

778
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,061
of the kind which induces...

779
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:30,727
defective biochemical reaction
and causes brain damage.

780
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:35,832
Fortunately, while the destruction
to the tissue is irreversible...

781
01:18:35,911 --> 01:18:37,538
the protein process is not.

782
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:42,775
Many researchers are able to reverse
the process through control of chemicals...

783
01:18:43,452 --> 01:18:46,148
which combine with the defective enzymes...

784
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:50,021
and change the molecular shape
of the interfering key, as it were.

785
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:53,520
This is also central in our technique.

786
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:56,928
But first we remove
the damaged portions of the brain...

787
01:18:57,165 --> 01:18:59,998
and permit the implanted tissues...

788
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:02,969
which have been chemically revitalized...

789
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:05,029
to produce brain protein...

790
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:07,706
at an accelerated and supernormal rate.

791
01:19:09,044 --> 01:19:10,170
Dr. Straus.

792
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:17,010
And now we would like to show you...

793
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:20,280
a film study of Charly Gordon...

794
01:19:20,622 --> 01:19:22,886
when he first came to the clinic.

795
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:35,592
Got my...

796
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:38,167
rabbit's foot.

797
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:41,538
That's very good. Shoes, gloves.

798
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:43,706
Shoes and gloves...

799
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:49,979
- You wear them.
- That's right.

800
01:19:50,051 --> 01:19:52,383
Morning, afternoon.

801
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:59,753
You don't have to worry
about passing or failing. Not these tests.

802
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:04,128
Morning, afternoon...

803
01:20:08,737 --> 01:20:10,830
That's a very funny face, Charly.

804
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:17,001
That was Charly Gordon then.

805
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:20,214
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like you...

806
01:20:20,348 --> 01:20:22,714
to meet Charly Gordon now.

807
01:21:32,187 --> 01:21:35,088
Are there any questions?

808
01:21:41,129 --> 01:21:42,756
Did you enjoy the film?

809
01:21:49,604 --> 01:21:50,832
Mr. Gordon...

810
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:57,405
how do you feel at the present moment
about your development?

811
01:22:00,181 --> 01:22:01,443
Grateful, sir.

812
01:22:02,117 --> 01:22:04,017
- You are happy about it?
- Yes.

813
01:22:10,825 --> 01:22:11,814
Why?

814
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:18,198
Because it has allowed me to see.

815
01:22:19,734 --> 01:22:20,894
To see what?

816
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:23,329
The world.

817
01:22:23,505 --> 01:22:25,632
And what do you see in that world?

818
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:30,608
My eyes are new, Doctor.

819
01:22:32,814 --> 01:22:34,714
What do they see, Mr. Gordon?

820
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:39,118
Things as they are.

821
01:22:40,088 --> 01:22:41,077
And?

822
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:45,686
And what they are becoming.

823
01:22:46,928 --> 01:22:49,192
Can you give me an example, Mr. Gordon?

824
01:22:49,264 --> 01:22:50,993
No, sir, you give me one.

825
01:22:54,502 --> 01:22:55,594
Very well.

826
01:22:58,907 --> 01:23:00,204
Modern science.

827
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:02,438
Rampant technology.

828
01:23:03,611 --> 01:23:05,238
Conscience by computer.

829
01:23:05,513 --> 01:23:06,810
Modern art.

830
01:23:06,915 --> 01:23:08,439
Dispassionate draftsmen.

831
01:23:08,516 --> 01:23:10,746
- Foreign policy.
- Brave new weapons.

832
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,385
- Today's youth.
- Joyless, guideless.

833
01:23:14,456 --> 01:23:17,323
- Today's religion.
- Preachment by popularity polls.

834
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:19,917
- Standard of living.
- A TV in every room.

835
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:23,856
- Education.
- A TV in every room!

836
01:23:25,934 --> 01:23:27,595
The world's future, Mr. Gordon.

837
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:31,036
Brave new hates, brave new bombs,
brave new wars.

838
01:23:32,974 --> 01:23:36,410
- The coming generation.
- Test-tube conception, laboratory birth...

839
01:23:36,478 --> 01:23:40,505
TV education, brave new dreams,
brave new hates, brave new wars...

840
01:23:40,582 --> 01:23:43,881
a beautifully purposeless process
of society suicide.

841
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:54,228
Any more questions?

842
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:58,026
In the back, any more questions about
things as they are...

843
01:23:58,099 --> 01:23:59,589
and what they're becoming?

844
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:00,656
No?

845
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:02,935
I have a question.

846
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:10,776
Professor Nemur...

847
01:24:13,581 --> 01:24:16,141
Charly Gordon?

848
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:21,621
Come on, Professor, you know.

849
01:24:27,762 --> 01:24:29,889
You know, but you haven't told me.

850
01:24:33,868 --> 01:24:37,360
Anybody out there answer the question
"Charly Gordon?"

851
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:43,304
Anyone in the back answer the question
"Charly Gordon?"

852
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:48,237
No.

853
01:24:50,018 --> 01:24:52,316
Well, I'm disappointed in you doctors.

854
01:24:53,121 --> 01:24:54,713
You're not very smart.

855
01:24:56,658 --> 01:24:58,853
You're not even as smart as a mouse.

856
01:25:00,962 --> 01:25:02,327
Because he knows.

857
01:25:03,865 --> 01:25:05,332
Algernon showed me.

858
01:25:08,203 --> 01:25:10,194
The answer to the question...

859
01:25:10,905 --> 01:25:13,635
"Charly Gordon?" is:

860
01:25:16,377 --> 01:25:18,072
Charly Gordon...

861
01:25:19,514 --> 01:25:20,811
is a fellow...

862
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:24,449
who will very shortly be...

863
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:28,522
what he used to be.

864
01:25:48,877 --> 01:25:50,276
Professor Nemur...

865
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:53,508
why didn't you tell me...

866
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,141
the success of the operation...

867
01:25:58,286 --> 01:25:59,878
was only temporary?

868
01:29:55,823 --> 01:29:57,347
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

869
01:29:57,425 --> 01:29:59,120
- Let me buy you a drink.
- No.

870
01:29:59,193 --> 01:30:01,024
- I wish you would.
- Waitress.

871
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:17,433
The entire Phase 5 group...

872
01:31:19,273 --> 01:31:21,002
all the same as Algernon.

873
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:30,183
Not one of the mice is capable anymore
of solving the simplest problem.

874
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:36,521
Did you find him?

875
01:31:36,924 --> 01:31:38,551
Why didn't you tell me?

876
01:31:39,994 --> 01:31:41,325
Why did you have to hide it?

877
01:31:41,395 --> 01:31:45,729
But we only discovered an indication
of this condition last week, Mrs. Kinnian...

878
01:31:45,933 --> 01:31:48,231
and only in a few of the Phase 5 mice.

879
01:31:48,569 --> 01:31:51,970
I assumed it was simply erratic behavior,
individual behavior.

880
01:31:52,039 --> 01:31:54,200
There was no need to alarm Charly!

881
01:31:54,275 --> 01:31:58,041
With the convention coming up, why should
you both miss your moments of glory?

882
01:31:58,112 --> 01:32:01,411
Before we could run further checks,
he had no right to make it public.

883
01:32:01,482 --> 01:32:03,814
- No right?
- Have you any idea what he's done...

884
01:32:03,885 --> 01:32:05,978
to our standing in the scientific community?

885
01:32:06,053 --> 01:32:10,012
Let us calmly, dispassionately,
try to decide what we are going to do...

886
01:32:10,091 --> 01:32:12,059
- About this situation.
- Which situation?

887
01:32:12,126 --> 01:32:15,095
- Your standing or Charly?
- They're related, you know.

888
01:32:15,329 --> 01:32:17,126
Is that all this means to you?

889
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:19,792
But don't you understand, Mrs. Kinnian?

890
01:32:19,867 --> 01:32:23,268
Algernon's regression doesn't prove
it will happen to Charly.

891
01:32:23,437 --> 01:32:26,668
Charly's a human being,
not a laboratory animal.

892
01:32:26,841 --> 01:32:29,742
This regressive syndrome may be limited
to the mice.

893
01:32:29,810 --> 01:32:31,141
I will thank you...

894
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:33,908
Have you been close to something,
but not close enough?

895
01:32:33,981 --> 01:32:37,781
Is there a second operation you can
give him, some corrective surgery?

896
01:32:38,019 --> 01:32:39,145
- No.
- I see.

897
01:32:41,122 --> 01:32:43,420
What do you do here
with the specimens that fail?

898
01:32:43,491 --> 01:32:45,891
The freezer first, then the incinerator?

899
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:00,437
How can I help?

900
01:33:03,144 --> 01:33:06,307
Consider the human brain
as an information-processing system...

901
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:07,369
of several parts.

902
01:33:07,448 --> 01:33:10,440
The cortical surface consisting of
distributed in logic arrays...

903
01:33:10,518 --> 01:33:13,351
various multi-directional buses
and distributing converters...

904
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:16,151
for converting synaptic memory
into DNA storage.

905
01:33:18,559 --> 01:33:21,824
One area for investigation
is the doctors' hypothesis...

906
01:33:22,296 --> 01:33:24,821
that the mind
can be permanently improved...

907
01:33:25,366 --> 01:33:27,766
through surgery and enzyme enrichment...

908
01:33:27,935 --> 01:33:31,234
thereby utilizing unused portions
of the brain. Can you program that?

909
01:33:31,305 --> 01:33:34,741
It's a little vague, Mr. Gordon.
Could you give me more detailed specs?

910
01:33:34,809 --> 01:33:37,972
It correlates to what we've already
programmed on DNA conversion.

911
01:33:38,045 --> 01:33:40,309
I see. Can we use the same system?

912
01:33:40,381 --> 01:33:42,212
Right. Just change the variables.

913
01:33:42,283 --> 01:33:46,014
Is mental improvement temporary because it
lacks appropriate DNA conversion...

914
01:33:46,087 --> 01:33:50,251
because of a storage limitation, which tends
to overload and disable the repaired area?

915
01:33:50,324 --> 01:33:52,417
Any combination of those factors?

916
01:33:52,727 --> 01:33:53,716
Run it.

917
01:33:54,395 --> 01:33:58,331
Assuming the brain neurons store
information on a temporary basis only...

918
01:33:58,399 --> 01:33:59,889
let's assume...

919
01:33:59,967 --> 01:34:01,798
Thank you, this one's finished.

920
01:34:01,869 --> 01:34:05,327
Assuming the brain neurons store
information on a temporary basis only...

921
01:34:05,406 --> 01:34:07,533
let us assume that this information...

922
01:34:07,608 --> 01:34:11,135
is subsequently coded
into DNA molecules...

923
01:34:12,513 --> 01:34:16,540
permitting storage of far more material
than the nerves could hold by themselves.

924
01:34:16,617 --> 01:34:19,609
It could be that this transformation
takes place during sleep...

925
01:34:19,687 --> 01:34:22,952
and is indeed one of the purposes
and needs for sleeping...

926
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:25,957
and for dreaming.

927
01:34:26,527 --> 01:34:28,222
Simulating brain damage.

928
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:31,689
Comparing homologous lesions
in the tissue of animals...

929
01:34:31,766 --> 01:34:33,290
and corresponding...

930
01:34:58,092 --> 01:35:01,994
It requires no great stretch of imagination
to visualize a possible connection...

931
01:35:02,063 --> 01:35:04,327
between protein synthesis and...

932
01:35:09,570 --> 01:35:10,559
And what?

933
01:35:22,116 --> 01:35:24,277
Perhaps the only possible answer...

934
01:35:25,953 --> 01:35:29,946
to our question is, whatever we said
the mind is, we'll discover it's not.

935
01:35:31,625 --> 01:35:33,456
It may be that we've been...

936
01:35:35,062 --> 01:35:38,122
trying to capture something
which is scientifically...

937
01:35:49,343 --> 01:35:51,140
Which by its very nature...

938
01:35:52,113 --> 01:35:53,944
is scientifically premature.

939
01:35:55,649 --> 01:35:57,082
Charly, go...

940
01:36:06,293 --> 01:36:09,558
Go home, Charly.
You'll work better in the morning.

941
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:11,158
I'm finished.

942
01:36:14,668 --> 01:36:16,158
My work is finished.

943
01:36:17,505 --> 01:36:18,665
That's good.

944
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:21,506
Then you can go home...

945
01:36:23,043 --> 01:36:24,874
and sleep for at least two days.

946
01:36:30,317 --> 01:36:32,683
These tapes will have to be programmed.

947
01:36:34,455 --> 01:36:36,184
Could they do it tonight?

948
01:36:39,093 --> 01:36:41,357
If you go home and sleep.

949
01:36:44,532 --> 01:36:45,897
I'd rather wait.

950
01:36:46,133 --> 01:36:47,657
Might take all night.

951
01:36:48,202 --> 01:36:49,294
I'll wait.

952
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:40,620
Your evaluations were correct.

953
01:37:45,626 --> 01:37:46,923
That's too bad.

954
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:52,230
- It was such a promising theory.
- It is.

955
01:37:53,234 --> 01:37:54,394
It still is.

956
01:38:00,074 --> 01:38:01,166
Thank you.

957
01:38:56,063 --> 01:38:57,428
Felt like coffee.

958
01:38:58,299 --> 01:38:59,789
Everything's closed.

959
01:39:00,167 --> 01:39:01,794
Not at Charly Gordon's.

960
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:05,131
Open 24 hours a day, you know that.

961
01:39:10,477 --> 01:39:13,469
- Hungry? Want some eggs?
- No, just coffee.

962
01:39:18,185 --> 01:39:19,982
I hope it's not too strong.

963
01:39:23,290 --> 01:39:24,655
Marry me, Charly.

964
01:39:29,596 --> 01:39:30,585
Now.

965
01:39:31,565 --> 01:39:32,554
Tonight.

966
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:37,994
I'll get you a spoon.

967
01:40:22,583 --> 01:40:23,572
Marry me.

968
01:40:34,461 --> 01:40:36,190
All right, don't marry me.

969
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:41,097
Motion carried.

970
01:40:42,236 --> 01:40:44,363
But I'm gonna stay. Right here.

971
01:40:46,140 --> 01:40:50,076
Whenever you feel like telling me to go,
just tell me so. I'll go.

972
01:40:53,447 --> 01:40:54,573
Leave.

973
01:40:58,852 --> 01:41:00,080
Please leave.

974
01:41:05,826 --> 01:41:06,918
All right.

975
01:41:34,888 --> 01:41:35,980
Good night.

976
01:41:38,058 --> 01:41:39,150
Good night.
