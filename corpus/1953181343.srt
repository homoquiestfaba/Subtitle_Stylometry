1
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:16,373
Man: As a kid, it baffled me
how God could know so much.

2
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:20,553
Not only past and present,

3
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,646
but the future as well.

4
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:31,464
The stories were beautiful...

5
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,989
austere...

6
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,763
terrifying.

7
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:39,295
And one loomed
over all others...

8
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:42,331
the story of Abraham.

9
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,901
God sends a man...

10
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:48,005
to slaughter his own son...

11
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:52,144
only to stop him
perilously close to the act,

12
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:54,780
to reveal it's all been a ruse.

13
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:57,120
Deedee, It's me.

14
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:00,126
Man: To me that story was,
and always will be,

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,960
not Abraham's story,
but Isaac's.

16
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:09,993
This boy must grow with the image
of his own father poised above him...

17
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:14,201
without it ever explained
why he's a victim.

18
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,175
Woman: You'll be
all right in there?

19
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:20,271
Man: I always knew I would devote
my life to clarity.

20
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:27,552
I would save the world's
uncomprehending victims.

21
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,523
What I never knew is,

22
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:33,355
when dealing with matters
of life and death...

23
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:38,290
as policemen inevitably do...

24
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,596
there's no way around
the question of God.

25
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,400
In fact, there are moments
when there's nothing else

26
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,307
that can be thought of
to say but, why?

27
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,614
And like Isaac found...

28
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,618
there's only silence
in response.

29
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,383
Lonely...

30
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:07,955
indeterminate silence.

31
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:09,724
Officer:
Hey, you all right?

32
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,065
Hey, stop walking!

33
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,729
I said, stop!

34
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:21,135
We called an ambulance.
It'll be here quick.

35
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:24,435
Is that your blood on you?

36
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:27,411
Damnit, answer me!

37
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,642
Hey!

38
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:32,379
I need to see your hands
in the air, slowly.

39
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:33,579
Do it now!

40
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,020
There's two of us back here.

41
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:37,683
Let him know
there's two of us.

42
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,783
- Officer #2: Hello!
- You heard that.

43
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,191
Bring up your hands.

44
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,287
Ease on up around him.

45
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:48,895
Kid, my partner's coming around
to get a better look at you.

46
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:53,596
Tommy?

47
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,131
Les, it's Tommy Spencer.

48
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,406
Is it his blood?

49
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,845
Well, he better hope not.

50
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,410
Okay, Tommy...

51
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:07,545
I need you to please
turn around for me, okay?

52
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:10,056
We ain't going to hurt you.

53
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,024
Just please turn around.

54
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,584
Tommy?

55
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:30,869
Just hold still.
Okay, Tommy?

56
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,902
We'll figure all this out.

57
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:36,714
Okay? Just...

58
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,615
just hold still.

59
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:52,175
Man: This story
has many beginnings.

60
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,847
We're going back six months

61
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:57,322
to the front end of spring.

62
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,959
I think there's going
to be two of us.

63
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,791
Waitress:
I'll fetch you another menu.

64
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,026
- Nothing doing at the Red's?
- I'm off this morning.

65
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,660
- I sure like your ribbon.
- It's yellow.

66
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,432
- I can see that.
- No. Like in the song...

67
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,907
It's Tony Orlando and Dawn.

68
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,877
- It was my favorite growing up.
- You don't mean it.

69
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:21,642
My man got out from
McAlester yesterday.

70
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:25,708
- He's meeting me here.
- Why didn't you go down there?

71
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,220
Woman: He thought
it'd be better this way...

72
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,815
- if I waited up here.
- All by yourself,

73
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,451
- while he travels half the state?
- Yes.

74
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,085
Bless your heart.

75
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:40,221
- Does this man love you?
- I don't know.

76
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,928
What do you mean?

77
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,697
- I think that's him.
- You think?

78
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,932
- We never met before.
- Should I point you out?

79
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,940
He knows I'm wearing
this ribbon.

80
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,204
I'll scoot out of your way.

81
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:02,417
- You Ainsley?
- Yes.

82
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,316
Ain't you gonna
look up at me?

83
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,399
That'll do.

84
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,700
- I can't do this.
- What?

85
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,073
Hey.

86
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,001
Hey.

87
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:29,010
How will I feel
if you run off on me so quick?

88
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,517
I need you to give this a chance.

89
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,179
If you leave now,
it'll be the end of me.

90
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,348
Come on back inside, please.

91
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,414
I'm begging you.

92
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:43,290
All right.

93
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,869
I haven't had you on my mind
for six months

94
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,902
- for you to be scared of me so quick.
- I won't leave.

95
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,244
- I ain't gonna let you.
- Don't.

96
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:03,681
All right, then.

97
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,184
- Is this menu for me?
- Yes.

98
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:15,054
I can't get used to all this.

99
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:19,327
It's the weirdest thing
about being out... choices.

100
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:20,958
You know,

101
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,299
we've got choices in life.

102
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,430
One of the things
prison's about is...

103
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:30,409
taking choices away from folks
incapable of making the right ones.

104
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,968
I ain't looked at it that way.

105
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,379
I reckon you ain't had to.

106
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:41,049
- So this here is Kingfisher?
- Mm-hmm.

107
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,146
It's just like you said...

108
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,623
- quiet and friendly.
- Lots of oil pumps.

109
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,627
Lots of oil pumps.

110
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,194
Different than McAlester?

111
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:54,359
There's no oil pumps
in McAlester.

112
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,801
I so wish
I could have seen it.

113
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,031
No, you don't.

114
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,973
It's where you lived.
All them letters come from there.

115
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,600
Them letters come from me.

116
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,578
- You know what I mean.
- You know what I mean.

117
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,547
I do.

118
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,142
Me and her had a talk
before you come in here.

119
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,447
Is that right?

120
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,351
You make sure
and treat this one right.

121
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,356
- Okay.
- She deserves it,

122
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,721
waiting on you like she did.

123
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,851
I can pick 'em,
and she's a keeper.

124
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,919
An angel from Heaven.

125
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:24,897
The Lord sent her
to watch over you.

126
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,126
I need that.

127
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:30,193
I don't know.
That boy in our line?

128
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,399
- You ain't got to tell me.
- Y'all are early.

129
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,635
- Ain't seen Sam, have you?
- Ain't been in yet.

130
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,142
You two sit on down.

131
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:38,576
- Hi, Ainsley.
- Hi.

132
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,476
I'll be with you in a minute.

133
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:43,277
You two want to order anything?

134
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,978
Uh, give me
the Cattleman's Breakfast here.

135
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,010
How do you like your eggs?

136
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,016
Scrambled, I guess.

137
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,858
- And for you?
- I can't eat.

138
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,228
- You have to eat something.
- I'm too frazzled.

139
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,029
Come on now.
How do you like your eggs?

140
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,533
Fried.

141
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:07,267
- Two eggs.
- Fried it is.

142
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:08,831
Sunny-side up.

143
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,810
Hey, just the way
my boy likes them.

144
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:14,439
But don't get me started
talking about him.

145
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:17,473
Oh goodness.
I'll be back with your food.

146
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:23,181
- She's lonely.
- Yeah, I can see that.

147
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,157
I've got to be at work
in 20 minutes.

148
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:32,957
Sorry I couldn't get off.
Lee, my manager, is strict.

149
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,523
That's all right.

150
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:36,626
It's just...

151
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:40,867
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

152
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,397
Me too.

153
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,572
I've got to meet my parole officer
this afternoon anyway.

154
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:50,606
- You do?
- I do.

155
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,617
But I'll meet you
when you get off.

156
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,056
- Take me somewhere tonight.
- All right.

157
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,456
I don't care.

158
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,289
Just some place special.

159
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,800
Special to you.

160
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,133
All right.

161
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:14,231
- We're together now.
- Oh yes.

162
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:15,832
Thank God.

163
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,541
We're together.

164
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,743
Parole Officer:
So you found religion, too?

165
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,013
Yes, sir.

166
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:30,614
That's neither one way
or the other with me, religion.

167
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:34,491
If Christ died for my sins,
I ain't seen the benefits.

168
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,928
But if you get satisfaction
from praying, so be it.

169
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:39,363
Yes, sir.

170
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,267
- So why Kingfisher?
- There's a girl up here.

171
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,567
You knew her
before you went in?

172
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,771
We met through a magazine.

173
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:52,244
- You see her yet?
- This morning.

174
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,839
- Sort of a blind date.
- I guess.

175
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,679
My wife and I met
on a blind date.

176
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,845
Getting involved
real quick after doing time

177
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,082
- can be a very serious thing.
- I know.

178
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:04,988
Particularly with
your kind of background.

179
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,491
I know that.

180
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:09,427
- What's her name?
- Ainsley.

181
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,724
Ainsley...

182
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,995
Ainsley Dupree.

183
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,730
- Works over at the Red's?
- That's right.

184
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,035
- Officer: I used to work with her dad.
- Really?

185
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,907
He was foreman at the pipeyard
during the boom.

186
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,969
- She told you how he died?
- No, actually.

187
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:30,210
When the yard closed down,
he'd became a tool-pusher.

188
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,808
He got caught in a rig fire.

189
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,319
Janice?
I need more of these.

190
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,480
In a minute!

191
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,990
Officer: He burned alive,
with three other guys.

192
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,015
She ain't said anything about it.

193
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,493
He was a son of a bitch
to work for.

194
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,259
Hard as nails.
Real religious, too.

195
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,095
It might interest you.

196
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,964
That was the joke.

197
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,869
He talked about hell so much,
he went that way.

198
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:55,774
You know, fire...

199
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,040
I get it.

200
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:02,741
She seems all right, though.
Homespun, reliable.

201
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,046
They make a good burger
over there.

202
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,110
So, how's the job situation?

203
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,817
You know,
I just came into town today.

204
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:13,655
Any special skills?

205
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:16,253
I like cars an awful lot.

206
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,627
Ainsley: Janice!

207
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:23,669
All right.

208
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,671
Fries.

209
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,875
Customer:
There's eight of us.

210
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,886
- Six kids?
- You betcha!

211
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,219
- Ainsley: What's that like?
- I wish I had two more.

212
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:46,191
What's it like for your wife?

213
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:49,093
She's always kept
her maternity clothes.

214
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,062
- I bet.
- She's got another one in the cooker.

215
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:53,122
- Really?
- You betcha!

216
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,930
What's all this
going to run me?

217
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,794
$21.83.

218
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,999
Hon, you have another $10?

219
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,032
Officer:
You gonna live with her?

220
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:07,308
- As long as she'll have me.
- She agreed to that?

221
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:12,444
- She agreed to let me stay there.
- Meaning?

222
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:15,784
Meaning, she agreed
to let me stay there.

223
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:18,120
This the address
you wrote down here?

224
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,057
Yes, sir.

225
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:22,353
Okay, Jack.

226
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,830
We'll put you on
our electronic monitor program.

227
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:34,104
You'll be wearing
this device around your ankle.

228
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,132
Whenever you progress
beyond 100 feet of the home,

229
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,973
we get a signal here
at the station

230
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:41,879
alerting us you've crossed
the boundaries of your parole.

231
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:45,372
I didn't how I had to do
a monitoring program.

232
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:48,444
You got four years
took off your sentence.

233
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:51,389
- Yeah?
- Consider yourself lucky.

234
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:55,087
- I consider myself blessed.
- Call it what you will.

235
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:58,495
This is not to confine you,
this is to monitor you.

236
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:06,866
Ainsley and me
were going out tonight.

237
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,737
We don't get
to her house till morning.

238
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,300
We'll need to get this
on your ankle right away, though.

239
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:14,404
We'll know where you are
tonight at all times.

240
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:17,280
In fact, we'll always
know where you are.

241
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:20,115
I need to know
where church is in town.

242
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:23,554
That should be easy enough.
Pick and choose.

243
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,523
Unless you're a Mormon or a Jew.

244
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:30,627
Hello?

245
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:34,093
Yeah, I know.

246
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,794
I'm on my way.

247
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,234
Okay.

248
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,165
It was my wife.

249
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,698
Trying to have a kid all year.

250
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:47,338
I'm even taking lunch at home
at certain times of the month.

251
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,007
Very frustrating.

252
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,039
Takes all the romance out of it.

253
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:54,542
Here's a card with
all my basic information.

254
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:57,112
I'll walk out with you,
get you set up,

255
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:00,284
get this put on your ankle
so I can get home.

256
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,055
Duty calls.

257
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,393
- It ain't weird?
- Weird?

258
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,701
- Him being in prison.
- He ain't in prison.

259
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,139
He was in prison.

260
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:18,109
I don't know, Janice,
it ain't weird, yet.

261
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,078
What did you talk about?

262
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:23,276
We weren't together an hour
before I had to come here.

263
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,546
You've got plenty of time.
Be patient.

264
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,348
He's lucky to have you.

265
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,719
You look like you'll give
yourself all up at once.

266
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,987
- I do not.
- Yes, you do.

267
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,255
I guess you'd know.

268
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,921
Uh-huh...

269
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:40,455
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

270
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,024
I want to know.

271
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,164
I'm sorry.
It don't mean nothing.

272
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,936
You can have whatever
opinion you want.

273
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:52,672
- All I'm saying...
- Lee's here.

274
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,509
It ain't no hurry.

275
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:57,573
I'm happy for you,
you hear me?

276
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:00,085
And maybe I'm a little jealous.

277
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:03,778
Lee: Get your ass
off the counter.

278
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:08,452
- What you girls talking about?
- Nothing.

279
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,553
- Bullshit.
- Nothing, Lee.

280
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,325
Get back to work,
why don't you?

281
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,299
Janice: I won't be in,
in the morning.

282
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,267
Lee:
What do you mean?

283
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:18,702
I've got some business
to take care of.

284
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:21,969
- What kind of business?
- My business.

285
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,771
- Ow!
- It's my business

286
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,244
- if there ain't nobody here.
- Ainsley: I'll open.

287
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,797
Yeah?

288
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,063
It's all right.
What have you got?

289
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,002
Uh-huh.

290
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,407
I'll be right over.

291
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,412
No, wait on me.

292
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,111
Wife: What is it?

293
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:08,552
They got little Tommy Spencer.

294
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,056
Wife: Is he all right?

295
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,223
Is he ever?

296
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:47,217
- Nobody knows what to do.
- Shh.

297
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:49,558
Tommy?

298
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,896
Tommy?

299
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:58,563
He ain't spoke
since we found him.

300
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:01,471
- Ain't a scratch on him?
- Not a one.

301
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:04,442
- Is this blood being checked?
- Les: It's at the hospital.

302
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,411
It's human. They don't know
the type yet.

303
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:09,209
We cleaned him up pretty good,
short of a shower.

304
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,580
- Give them a call. Hurry up.
- Who?

305
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,347
The hospital.
See what they've got to say.

306
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:15,911
You want us to call Dorothy?

307
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:18,150
No, I'll do that.
Go on, git.

308
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:21,860
Both of you.

309
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,499
Tom?

310
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:37,135
Do you recognize me?

311
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,376
Tom?

312
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,845
How's your aunt?
Is she doing all right?

313
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,620
Tom?

314
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,733
Can you talk with me?

315
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,530
Tom?

316
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:09,265
You've got this whole building
in a stir, you know that?

317
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:13,744
Tom, do you understand me?

318
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,474
Do you hear me?

319
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,975
Just nod your head
if you hear me.

320
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,487
Just nod your head.

321
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,581
Tom, do you hear me?

322
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:30,920
Good.

323
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,794
That's all you've got to do.

324
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,366
Now...

325
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,802
whatever you've seen tonight...

326
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:41,636
wherever you've been...
it's over.

327
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:44,700
But we can't figure out
where all this blood comes from.

328
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:48,544
If this person is still alive,
maybe we can help them.

329
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:52,243
Tom, you understand?

330
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,645
Who were you with tonight?

331
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:59,117
Where were you?

332
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,683
Can you take us there?

333
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:02,853
Tom?

334
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:06,763
Can you take us
to where you were?

335
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,495
You can take us there?

336
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:17,673
Good boy, Tom.

337
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,345
Good boy.

338
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:24,648
Les?

339
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,815
- You and Bobby got the left shore.
- Get it, Bobby.

340
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:35,851
- He didn't want to call state?
- No.

341
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,988
I'm sick of feeling
sorry for this kid.

342
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,464
- What does that mean?
- Why ain't we calling the state?

343
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,990
- The kid's half crazy.
- Sam's got his reasons.

344
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,629
- What are they?
- Glen, what do you want?

345
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:06,357
Tom, what have you got there?

346
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:07,950
Tom.

347
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,590
Tom?

348
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:14,597
God damn it.

349
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,567
Somebody help me.

350
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:18,593
- Tom.
- It's all right now.

351
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,468
Let it go, Tommy.

352
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,872
- Let it go, Tom.
- Easy, Tom.

353
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,538
Take it easy, son.

354
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,583
Les: It's okay, Tommy.

355
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,247
Sam: Damn!

356
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,448
All right.

357
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:43,462
Les, get him
back in the car,

358
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:45,930
and have a doctor
meet us at the station.

359
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:49,594
- Les: What is it?
- Sam: Can't you do what I ask

360
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:52,069
without pestering me
with questions?

361
00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:00,468
All right, this is it.

362
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:03,141
You boys mark off
this whole area.

363
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:06,174
- It's out here in the water.
- What is it?

364
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,518
What have you got?

365
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,123
Sheriff!

366
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,591
Sheriff!

367
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:18,562
Come on, give us
a hand over here.

368
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:23,932
Jack: You know,
if you don't marry me

369
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,630
after spending all my time
in the house...

370
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:26,968
Ainsley: No.

371
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:29,804
Look out there.
Ain't this beautiful?

372
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,771
Jack: Yes.

373
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:37,379
- Thank you, Ainsley.
- Let's get out.

374
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,459
I spent a lot of time
as a child on this lake.

375
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:53,056
- You know what else?
- What?

376
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,430
My mama swears
I was conceived here.

377
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,525
What?

378
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:59,629
Her and my daddy used
to come up here on weekends.

379
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:02,664
One time in their senior year,
it happened.

380
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:08,176
- You mean...
- They got married and had me proper.

381
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:11,843
I think that's where birth happens
not in some hospital.

382
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:14,512
- Yeah.
- I was born right here.

383
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,420
My parole officer told me
how your daddy died.

384
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:27,091
- He did?
- Why you never mentioned it?

385
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,101
Me and my daddy
never got along too good.

386
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,967
- I met the preacher today.
- The preacher?

387
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:41,741
A preacher.

388
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:46,579
- He seemed eager to help me out.
- Good.

389
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:48,644
You don't go to church?

390
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,621
You never wrote about it
in your letters.

391
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,248
No.

392
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,154
What else did
your parole officer say?

393
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:59,221
He says it won't be
easy finding work.

394
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:03,492
He says lots of folks
are moving away.

395
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,765
But I'll find something.

396
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,294
I promise.

397
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,398
Jack, I know you will.

398
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,535
Jack?

399
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:17,214
Yes?

400
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:25,084
Will you tell me
why you was in prison?

401
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:30,493
- We've been over that.
- But that was the letters.

402
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,497
Are you afraid
I won't love you?

403
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:38,661
As far as you and me
are concerned,

404
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,672
I ain't never been to prison.

405
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:45,237
If you hadn't been to prison
we'd have never met.

406
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,378
I reckon not.

407
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:53,282
So?

408
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,913
Can I kiss you now?

409
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,585
Yes.

410
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:03,858
Here I come.

411
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:20,709
- How was that?
- It was tender.

412
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,405
I ain't done that
in a long time.

413
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:28,887
- You want to do it again?
- I do.

414
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,302
What's your favorite part of me?

415
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:48,897
I don't know.

416
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,206
Tell me. And I'll tell you.

417
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,918
Your chest.

418
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:12,725
Your most beautiful part
are your eyes.

419
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:15,529
Even my parole officer said so.

420
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,092
He's seen you over at the Red's.

421
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,571
What?

422
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:29,512
There's something I ain't told you
in the letters.

423
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:32,414
What?

424
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:37,614
One of them is glass.

425
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,692
One of your eyes?

426
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,827
- Which?
- This one.

427
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:48,627
Why?

428
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,067
It got cut out when I was 12.

429
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:55,506
Me and my friend were playing
with an electric knife.

430
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:57,907
It don't look glass at all.

431
00:27:57,943 --> 00:28:00,309
It ain't supposed to.

432
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:05,148
For near two years
I wore a patch,

433
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,982
'cause my daddy said
if God wanted an eye in there,

434
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,955
he wouldn't have let
the real one get cut out.

435
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,521
You wore a patch?

436
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,585
You didn't have nothing in there?

437
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,494
What changed his mind?

438
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,733
When he died...

439
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,667
my mama said, "I'm tired
of looking at you like that. "

440
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,368
So she carried me
down to Oklahoma City

441
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,003
and got me one of these.

442
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:37,605
It's the only time
I ever been there.

443
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,081
I'm going to take care of you.

444
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:44,152
I know.

445
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,052
Ainsley?

446
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,583
Yes.

447
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,707
Will you marry me?

448
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,801
- Oh my God.
- I know it's quick.

449
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:09,075
- You don't have to answer now.
- Shh. No, I will.

450
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,412
I will marry you.

451
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:17,080
I want us
to have children, Ainsley.

452
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,953
- A family.
- Yes.

453
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:21,255
- I owe the Lord for setting me free.
- Jack...

454
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:22,590
I owe him.

455
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:27,420
It's the most important
thing... children.

456
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:28,797
Yes.

457
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:34,632
Jack: Children.

458
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:38,370
Give us some room now.
Everybody out but Les.

459
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:43,375
- I'll get the tape on.
- That ain't necessary.

460
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:46,350
- But...
- Get a notebook.

461
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:49,013
He's scared enough already
without his every move

462
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:51,545
getting sucked up
by a video camera.

463
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:56,456
Hey, kiddo.

464
00:29:57,496 --> 00:30:01,091
The doctor said
you'll be all right.

465
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,933
You're safe here,
you know that?

466
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:10,305
Tom, you know you're safe?

467
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:14,072
Now, Tom...

468
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,410
I've got to ask you something.

469
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:19,315
You just nod yes and no,
but I have to ask you.

470
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:24,651
Did you do that
to this person?

471
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,590
All right.

472
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,388
I know you didn't.

473
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:31,756
Did you see it happen?

474
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,693
Did you know that...

475
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:39,704
All right.

476
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:44,607
So, the first time
you met was tonight?

477
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:50,009
What about the person
who's done it?

478
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:52,278
Did you know him?

479
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:56,277
Was it a man?

480
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:58,846
And you didn't know him?

481
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:03,888
Had you ever seen him before?

482
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:11,135
Did...

483
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,229
all right.
That's all right, Tom.

484
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:15,934
Shh.

485
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:19,068
It's all right.
That's fine for now.

486
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:21,807
That's just fine.
Get the mug books,

487
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:24,873
and someone get
his aunt on the phone.

488
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,612
We'll bring some books in here

489
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:30,144
and then this'll be over.

490
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,247
You've done good.

491
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:34,555
We'll figure all this out.

492
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:38,463
You've done good.

493
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,996
Ainsley: Here it is.

494
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:45,503
This here is the kitchen.

495
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,131
I've got a microwave...

496
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:52,439
and a four burners,
plus this toaster oven.

497
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:55,742
Down here is the real oven.

498
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:58,375
Up here's all the dishes.

499
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:03,018
You keep a clean house.

500
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:05,580
And, uh...

501
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:09,890
through here is the bedroom.

502
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,122
Well, no...

503
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:14,662
tonight I'll stay on the sofa.

504
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,997
Okay.

505
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,434
Ainsley, keep away.

506
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:22,604
Ainsley.

507
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:25,405
Ainsley.
All right now.

508
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,679
No, no, no.

509
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:32,183
That's it. No more.

510
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,822
You're aggressive for someone
who ain't made love ever.

511
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:44,419
That's why I'm aggressive.

512
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,621
Listen...

513
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:50,658
I've been locked up
for three years.

514
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,135
I feel that way too.

515
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,630
What happens between
a man and a woman is sacred.

516
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:59,803
Jack:
It can't be took lightly.

517
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:01,472
Ainsley: All right.

518
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:05,048
Jack: We've got to do
everything proper.

519
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:10,481
Jack: Everything.

520
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:31,431
- Where are you going?
- Out and around.

521
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,569
Where out and around?

522
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:37,480
- I don't know.
- Taking Jimmy's car?

523
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:38,540
Yeah.

524
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,074
When did you say he
and his daddy was coming home?

525
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,614
He didn't say.

526
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:46,681
Where do you go
when you go off driving?

527
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:48,386
You're 14 years-old.

528
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:52,826
Will you answer me, please?

529
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:56,994
You think it makes me happy
to have another kid to take care of?

530
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,401
I don't know.

531
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:01,406
What do you want me to do?

532
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,271
Talk with me sometimes.

533
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:05,799
I got no one to talk with.
My sister's gone,

534
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:07,903
and I don't ever see my husband.

535
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:11,883
Stay home tonight.

536
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:14,442
"CHiPs" in on the cable,
and "Knight Rider"...

537
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:17,011
you liking cars so much.

538
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,523
I'd rather go out.

539
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,288
- I'll go with you.
- No.

540
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:25,489
Then you're grounded.
How's that?

541
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:29,259
I'll microwave us some popcorn...

542
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:31,997
- and we'll look at the cable.
- I'm leaving.

543
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:34,870
Tom, I said we're spending
the evening together.

544
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:39,068
Mind me! I mean it!

545
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,544
I said, mind me!

546
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:46,114
Get back right now
or don't come back at all.

547
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:50,485
Come back in right now
or don't come back at all!

548
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:54,491
Tom!

549
00:34:58,063 --> 00:34:59,223
Tom!

550
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,627
Woman:
Answer the phone, Will.

551
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:08,666
Hello?

552
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:11,232
Hello, Will.
Sorry about the hour.

553
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,937
Will: It's all right.

554
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:16,937
- How is it with the wife?
- Oh, same.

555
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:20,213
You'll sort it out.
Listen...

556
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:22,982
do you mind coming down
to the station?

557
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:26,388
- Will: What's up?
- It's a little complicated.

558
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:29,052
We've got a body.

559
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:31,221
And...

560
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:35,427
look's like Claire Spencer's boy
got wrapped up in it somehow.

561
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,067
Will?

562
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:42,535
I'll be right there.

563
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:03,926
Hey.

564
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:06,956
Hey.

565
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:10,296
Where have you been?
I was worried crazy.

566
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:14,834
I got a job.

567
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,502
Hello?

568
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:25,311
Yeah, on for tonight.
All right. Bye.

569
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,148
- Where?
- The DX station.

570
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:32,782
- We both work on the highway now.
- Doing what?

571
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:34,951
Mechanic.

572
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:36,858
I worked all day.

573
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:39,693
I changed the transmission;
rebuilt two alternators...

574
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:43,997
- One of them was a Honda.
- That's great, Jack.

575
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,060
Are you all right?

576
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:49,039
- Red's is closing down.
- What?!

577
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:53,033
- Red's don't close down.
- They do if nobody's buying burgers.

578
00:36:55,347 --> 00:36:58,043
It may take a while,
but I'll find something else.

579
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:00,677
Me and Janice will
start looking this weekend.

580
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,186
Why?

581
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:05,384
Why?

582
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:08,551
I got a job.

583
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:10,458
We'll be fine.

584
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,258
No, Jack.
I started my period today.

585
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,435
You don't got to say it
outright like that.

586
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:22,497
I'm sorry.
It's a natural thing.

587
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:28,243
I told the preacher
I'd bring you to church on Sunday.

588
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:30,907
Why you told him that?

589
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:33,747
He keeps asking about you.

590
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:36,185
I ain't been since I was 14.

591
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:37,745
Ainsley...

592
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,419
- I want a Christian home.
- It can be as Christian as you like.

593
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,587
I just don't want to go to church.

594
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:47,625
Ainsley...

595
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,562
things are going so good,
with the job and everything.

596
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:56,404
Going to church is the only time
I can leave here, except for work.

597
00:37:57,976 --> 00:37:59,910
I want you with me.

598
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:06,345
All right.

599
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:10,377
- Is it?
- Yes.

600
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:14,982
I love you.

601
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,965
Hey, Tommy.

602
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:31,971
New shoes?

603
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,071
Tom: No.

604
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:38,708
They're just hand-me-downs.

605
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:41,150
- Your cousin?
- Yeah.

606
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:43,245
Listen to me.
Who else, right?

607
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:44,846
You have a new car?

608
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:48,559
Are you all alone?

609
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:50,151
Yeah.

610
00:38:51,196 --> 00:38:52,823
Hey, how's your aunt?

611
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:54,297
Fine.

612
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,959
She's worried about you.

613
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,935
She said you ain't been coming
to church lately.

614
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,700
- Yeah.
- Come to our church.

615
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:05,437
- I'll bring you.
- No. I don't think so.

616
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:06,876
Well...

617
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:08,811
the Lord help us.

618
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,249
- That'll be all for you?
- Yeah.

619
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:15,810
You want some beef jerky?
How about jaw-breakers?

620
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,378
Let me show you this.

621
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,521
What do you think?

622
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,993
Nothing else for you then?

623
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,161
No.

624
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,501
Slush Puppy? Coolie?

625
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,436
Slim Jim?

626
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:40,233
Are you okay?

627
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:46,317
Who's that lady?

628
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:08,839
Will: She's going
to church with you?

629
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:11,205
Jack:
Sunday'll be the third week.

630
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:16,240
Will:
So married life's all right?

631
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:18,306
Jack:
Couldn't be better.

632
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:22,417
I wish
I could say the same.

633
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:25,883
I'm sorry.

634
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,620
These are strange times
in these parts.

635
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:32,391
They say, ain't been
this kind of migration out

636
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,863
since the dust bowl.

637
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:38,630
Almost everyone we service at
the station is just passing through.

638
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,194
They don't live here.

639
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:43,435
Sometimes I think the reason
she wants a kid so bad

640
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:46,841
is to have something
to do with her time.

641
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:51,905
- It's mighty tragic.
- Not that I don't want a child.

642
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,350
I'd love a son.

643
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:57,252
You and Ainsley
want a family?

644
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,949
There's nothing
more important to me.

645
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,958
All right. That's right.

646
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:03,187
I just...

647
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:05,662
you're a lucky man
to have a second chance.

648
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:07,528
I know that.

649
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:10,329
I think we'll get
a separation over this.

650
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:14,231
- That's awful.
- You ain't kidding.

651
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:16,706
That's all we talk
about anymore.

652
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:18,709
I'm tired of taking the blame.

653
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:20,938
I'm sick of playing defense,
you know?

654
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,810
Yeah.

655
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,508
It's...

656
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,256
you don't want to hear this.

657
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:36,089
Oh, say...

658
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:39,654
I might be doing that spot check
on you the next couple of weeks.

659
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:41,722
- You keep saying that.
- It'll happen.

660
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:44,564
I'm hoping to get your wife
to broil me up a burger.

661
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,627
What, with them
closing down Red's.

662
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,195
Okay.

663
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,232
Do you believe that?
Even Red's turned his back on us.

664
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,375
Oh.

665
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,417
Jack: You know what
I think making love is?

666
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:06,787
- Ainsley: What?
- Prayer.

667
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:09,793
When you make love proper...

668
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:12,762
prayer floats up away from it.

669
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:17,257
There's no prayer more beautiful
to God than what we've just done.

670
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:18,929
Do you believe that?

671
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,696
Ainsley: I believe I've never
been happier than right now.

672
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:28,109
I get restless around the house...

673
00:42:28,146 --> 00:42:30,614
without work.

674
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:33,082
I miss you.

675
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:35,244
But you come home and...

676
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,277
hold me.

677
00:42:37,322 --> 00:42:39,449
We make love...

678
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,958
cradle me like you do.

679
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:47,826
I feel there's nothing left
in this world I can possibly want.

680
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:50,356
Only to feel your touch.

681
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:55,967
Jack?

682
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,872
Can I tell you something?

683
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:04,279
Yes?

684
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,816
Ainsley?

685
00:43:12,457 --> 00:43:15,620
I don't think I believe in God.

686
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,457
That's all right.

687
00:43:17,495 --> 00:43:19,486
It is?

688
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:21,930
You just ain't found Him yet.

689
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:27,028
He's in your life.
You just can't see him.

690
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:32,270
- Don't nobody see God.
- But we see what he do.

691
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,141
That's what faith is.

692
00:43:36,014 --> 00:43:38,141
How do I get faith?

693
00:43:39,384 --> 00:43:41,477
You just got to let go.

694
00:43:44,222 --> 00:43:46,053
Ainsley.

695
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:51,457
You've got goodness in you.

696
00:43:51,496 --> 00:43:53,930
Whether you believe
in Him or not,

697
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:56,832
You're as close to God
as near anyone I've met.

698
00:43:59,337 --> 00:44:01,362
I love you.

699
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:04,807
I mean that.

700
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:07,208
An angel like you.

701
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:10,574
He's there.

702
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:13,942
Ainsley: I hope so.

703
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,545
Jack: Make love
with me again, Ainsley.

704
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:20,650
- All the blood's off him.
- Sheriff: Uh-huh.

705
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:22,556
But he still
ain't spoke a word.

706
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:24,527
He's locked himself
in his room.

707
00:44:24,562 --> 00:44:26,427
When do you have
to go to work?

708
00:44:26,464 --> 00:44:28,329
I got today off.

709
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:30,459
My husband called a while ago.

710
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,231
Him and Jimmy will be
at the yard all day.

711
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:35,501
You reckon if this child
had a man figure around

712
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,667
for one day of his life,
he'd be so odd

713
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:39,335
and in trouble
with the law all the time?

714
00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:42,403
- He ain't in trouble with the law.
- You know how many times

715
00:44:42,447 --> 00:44:45,974
he's been picked up on the highway
for driving that car underaged?

716
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:49,885
And them patrollers
let him go out of pity.

717
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:54,358
You'd think a car would be
the last thing he'd want to get in.

718
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:57,020
Can you explain that one?

719
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:59,393
A car?

720
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,199
Aunt:
What kind of photo?

721
00:45:05,236 --> 00:45:07,136
We ain't took none recently.

722
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:10,732
I got some his mama had.

723
00:45:10,775 --> 00:45:12,640
Sheriff:
That'd be fine.

724
00:45:12,677 --> 00:45:16,841
As recent as possible, though.
Someone will be right over.

725
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:19,042
Aunt: Okay.

726
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:23,743
Clerk:
You've never seen her?

727
00:45:23,788 --> 00:45:25,221
No.

728
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:29,192
Clerk:
Her name's Ainsley.

729
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,819
She works at the Red's.

730
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,589
She's married to an ex-con
from McAlester.

731
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,495
He wears a beeper on his leg

732
00:45:38,536 --> 00:45:40,629
so the police
always know where he's at.

733
00:45:41,706 --> 00:45:43,640
I used to always
see her in here.

734
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,608
I ain't seen her lately.

735
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:50,745
- What is she doing?
- Clerk: What does it look like?

736
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:52,908
Sitting.

737
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:56,147
The Oklahoma City bus
dropped her off an hour ago.

738
00:45:56,187 --> 00:45:59,452
Stop staring or
she'll call you over.

739
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:00,718
So?

740
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:04,023
Ain't I just told you
her husband's an ex-con?

741
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:06,461
She looks so sad.

742
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:09,830
I'm telling you, stay away.
She's a talker.

743
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:12,529
Why do you keep looking at me?

744
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:16,131
- Clerk: Too late.
- I don't know.

745
00:46:17,408 --> 00:46:19,569
Come over here.

746
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:23,774
Don't be afraid.

747
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:26,374
He's just a kid,
he ain't looking for no trouble.

748
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:28,351
Ainsley: Come on over.

749
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:37,292
A closed-circuit TV signal that takes
what happens here in Denver

750
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:40,126
and sends it all the way back
to a court room in Oklahoma City

751
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:41,722
appears to be
on the way to reality...

752
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:44,932
Hey.

753
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:58,574
RJ say he's been seeing you over
at the Total on his lunch hour.

754
00:46:58,616 --> 00:47:00,880
Ainsley:
I guess so.

755
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:04,285
Says you sit and talk to folks.

756
00:47:05,523 --> 00:47:09,254
I get lonely.
I have nothing to do all day.

757
00:47:12,797 --> 00:47:14,788
So you hang out at the Total?

758
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:18,290
I've been going there since
I was old enough to drive.

759
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,907
What do you say to folks?

760
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:28,138
Is there a problem?

761
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:30,113
Jack:
No. No problem.

762
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:31,614
Just...

763
00:47:31,649 --> 00:47:33,549
what do you say to folks?

764
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:39,019
I ask where they're going
or something.

765
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:41,422
Just small talk.

766
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:43,393
I miss people.

767
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:51,695
- Any news?
- You ask me every day.

768
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,662
Jack:
I want to know.

769
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,764
Christ, we've been
married five months.

770
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:59,537
- Don't say that word like that.
- What word?

771
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:01,238
- You know.
- Christ?

772
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,406
- Yes.
- Fine.

773
00:48:35,546 --> 00:48:38,208
- I'm sorry.
- No, I am.

774
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,410
I just want a family.
I want that for us.

775
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:42,146
So do I.

776
00:48:42,186 --> 00:48:45,986
All my prayers and thoughts
come to what can make us happy.

777
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:48,651
We'll have a family.

778
00:48:48,693 --> 00:48:50,854
That's all I want.

779
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,664
I want what's best for us.

780
00:48:58,703 --> 00:49:00,898
- You know that?
- Yes.

781
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:06,443
Listen to me...

782
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:11,941
I don't want you to leave this house
unless I know where you're going.

783
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:14,473
- What?
- I mean it.

784
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:16,315
I want you here.

785
00:49:16,354 --> 00:49:18,948
- I am here.
- I want you here.

786
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:22,516
I don't want to be wondering
where you are.

787
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,188
- Jack.
- Ainsley, no.

788
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:30,430
I want a proper home.

789
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:33,130
A home God would want
to give a family to.

790
00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:38,234
- I'll leave here whenever I like.
- You sure won't.

791
00:49:40,411 --> 00:49:42,675
What you gonna do to me
if I do leave?

792
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:45,944
I'll bolt these doors.
I mean it.

793
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,883
I could do that.

794
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:50,978
- You think you're lonely now...
- Jack.

795
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:53,990
No, that's it.
The discussion's over.

796
00:50:01,899 --> 00:50:03,628
Come here.

797
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:09,232
Come here.

798
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,908
I'm Ainsley.

799
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:17,277
Tom.

800
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,982
I could use some company
for a while.

801
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:26,179
I don't mean no harm.

802
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:42,635
I think I might have
left my husband tonight.

803
00:50:50,114 --> 00:50:52,708
Del said...

804
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:55,150
you've been to Oklahoma City?

805
00:50:55,186 --> 00:50:58,019
It's the second time in my life.

806
00:51:01,926 --> 00:51:05,054
How long was you
and your husband married for?

807
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:09,025
About six months.

808
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:11,896
Where are you going?

809
00:51:13,337 --> 00:51:15,635
Just out and around.

810
00:51:15,673 --> 00:51:17,800
Just out and around?

811
00:51:18,843 --> 00:51:20,310
Driving.

812
00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:25,414
I want to go up to the lake.

813
00:51:30,154 --> 00:51:32,452
Are you by yourself?

814
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:34,355
Yeah.

815
00:51:35,993 --> 00:51:39,326
I don't know is it too safe
up there nights.

816
00:51:42,166 --> 00:51:44,430
Will you come with me...

817
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:46,561
to the lake?

818
00:51:50,007 --> 00:51:51,406
Yeah.

819
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,433
You take me then.

820
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:56,378
You take me up there.

821
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:59,746
Ainsley:
It's where I was born.

822
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:17,596
You ain't gonna get
to see the Pope.

823
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:20,001
If you see that Pope,
you'll have to stand out there

824
00:52:20,037 --> 00:52:21,937
with 100,000 other folks...

825
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:25,066
hoping that he walks
out on that shelf up yonder

826
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:26,906
on the side of the wall.

827
00:52:26,944 --> 00:52:29,606
You ain't gonna get
to see that Pope...

828
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,609
Well...

829
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:48,959
Oh God.

830
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,627
Ainsley...

831
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:54,700
this is what
we've been waiting on.

832
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:57,536
I know we've been waiting,
Jack.

833
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:06,315
I met your parole officer.

834
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:08,750
What?

835
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:13,723
He came by last Tuesday
while you was at work.

836
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,327
Jack: Yeah?

837
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:20,296
Ainsley:
And I never let on about this.

838
00:53:21,332 --> 00:53:23,857
- Will: Thank you, ma'am.
- Ainsley: But he told me things.

839
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:30,466
Will: This is what the state
calls a "spot check. "

840
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:35,877
The state feels
Jack is rehabilitated...

841
00:53:35,913 --> 00:53:38,279
Rehabilitated. Uh...

842
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:42,246
but they always say
the spouse should know.

843
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:47,524
So you probably
know this, but...

844
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:51,961
- Jack used to live outside Tulsa.
- Yes.

845
00:53:51,996 --> 00:53:55,432
And five years ago,
he was a very different man.

846
00:53:56,467 --> 00:53:59,163
In fact, his turnaround
has been remarkable.

847
00:53:59,203 --> 00:54:01,034
What did he do?

848
00:54:02,306 --> 00:54:05,571
- I don't know what you know.
- I don't know much.

849
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:09,045
Well, he was
a regular shithead...

850
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,979
excuse me...

851
00:54:12,016 --> 00:54:15,543
- who was going nowhere fast.
- What did he do?

852
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:22,721
You mean, you never...

853
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,955
you mean, specifically?

854
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,699
Well, I guess...

855
00:54:34,038 --> 00:54:35,938
he nearly beat
a woman to death.

856
00:54:39,143 --> 00:54:41,543
The gal was living
with at the time.

857
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:46,439
And...

858
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:48,678
What?

859
00:54:50,688 --> 00:54:52,918
She was carrying
their child at the time.

860
00:55:00,431 --> 00:55:02,831
And what happened to her?

861
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:05,130
The gal made it.

862
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,178
God.

863
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:24,219
- Jack.
- I ain't like that no more.

864
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:27,382
Jack, I told you
that first night we met

865
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:31,554
that what you did that got you in prison
didn't make no difference to me.

866
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:35,457
That officer could
have told me anything,

867
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:37,467
I'd still love you.

868
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:41,095
But that ain't the point.

869
00:55:42,573 --> 00:55:45,736
I've got nothing left
to give a child.

870
00:55:47,244 --> 00:55:49,337
Let me speak.

871
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:53,917
I sit here all day.

872
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:57,409
You won't even let me leave
my own home no more.

873
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:01,583
I can't even believe
I'm pregnant.

874
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:04,253
I feel so empty in here.

875
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:06,285
Keep away.

876
00:56:07,765 --> 00:56:10,563
I've got to make it right.

877
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:14,966
I want to make it right.

878
00:56:15,005 --> 00:56:17,371
And we ain't right.

879
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:21,740
I won't hear this.

880
00:56:23,347 --> 00:56:25,815
How can you say
you won't hear this?

881
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:29,776
I don't want to hear this.

882
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:34,251
Then...

883
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:39,187
Jack, that don't make
no difference.

884
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,890
What are you saying?

885
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:48,393
- Janice told me...
- Don't you think for a second.

886
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:50,702
It ain't up to you.

887
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:53,733
- Like hell it ain't.
- Keep away from me.

888
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:57,612
I ain't going to touch you.

889
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,683
I wouldn't do that.

890
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:04,312
Honey, you're everything to me.
Look at me.

891
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:06,049
You're everything.

892
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:11,449
- Just let me know you hear me.
- I hear you, Jack.

893
00:57:11,495 --> 00:57:13,861
Just tell me
we're going to do this.

894
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:16,422
- Jack...
- Say it.

895
00:57:18,836 --> 00:57:21,737
- Say we'll do it.
- Keep away.

896
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,706
Say it.

897
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:26,572
Come on, say we'll do it.

898
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:29,077
Say it.

899
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:31,778
Say it.

900
00:57:33,851 --> 00:57:36,513
Say we'll do it.
Say the words.

901
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:38,418
Ainsley: We'll do it.

902
00:57:43,527 --> 00:57:44,824
Do what?

903
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,959
Say it.

904
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:56,435
We're going to have a child.

905
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:59,168
Say it.

906
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:37,575
Will: It's standard procedure.
A wife should know.

907
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:39,605
I want another parole officer.

908
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:43,518
If you want to stay in this county,
you're stuck with me.

909
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:45,521
Since you're here,
I have some good news.

910
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:48,991
- You'll be taken off monitoring.
- You nearly ruined my marriage.

911
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:52,723
Well, take it up
with a marriage counselor.

912
00:58:52,763 --> 00:58:54,754
Ain't you happy?

913
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:57,164
- Yeah, I'm happy.
- Will: Good.

914
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,668
- Come on in.
- I'd rather not. Thanks.

915
00:59:00,938 --> 00:59:02,235
Fine.

916
00:59:03,407 --> 00:59:04,396
Hello?

917
00:59:04,441 --> 00:59:06,033
Hey...

918
00:59:06,076 --> 00:59:07,771
I've got some good news too.

919
00:59:07,811 --> 00:59:09,244
Janice?

920
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:11,270
I'm going to be a daddy.

921
00:59:11,315 --> 00:59:14,375
- Is that right?
- Yes, it is.

922
00:59:15,419 --> 00:59:18,786
Really, it's...
so how's Ainsley?

923
00:59:18,822 --> 00:59:20,722
She's great.

924
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:24,158
- Says she's never been happier.
- That's wonderful.

925
00:59:25,696 --> 00:59:28,426
You don't seem
sincerely excited for me.

926
00:59:28,465 --> 00:59:30,365
What's that supposed to mean?

927
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,461
You just... you don't seem
truly happy for me.

928
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:35,493
Fuck you.

929
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:39,409
I didn't say nothing.

930
00:59:39,443 --> 00:59:41,604
I just said
I was going to be a daddy.

931
00:59:41,645 --> 00:59:44,978
You could put your own problems
aside and be happy for me.

932
00:59:45,015 --> 00:59:46,744
- You'd better leave now.
- What?

933
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:50,116
Get out right now if you know
what's good for you.

934
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:53,281
Or I'll slap you back on monitoring
for five fucking years!

935
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:54,551
I'm leaving.

936
01:00:42,873 --> 01:00:45,433
Jack, I'm Sheriff Rogers.

937
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:49,571
- What's this video camera?
- Standard procedure.

938
01:00:49,613 --> 01:00:51,444
I understand you waived counsel.

939
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,609
- I don't need counsel.
- That's still your right.

940
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,881
You're waiving counsel
for this interview?

941
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,445
- Yes.
- Good.

942
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,014
I'd like to call my wife.

943
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:08,223
Officer Sprague tells me
you're a religious man.

944
01:01:08,265 --> 01:01:09,630
Yes, I am.

945
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:13,099
You want to talk with me
about that?

946
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:15,036
Are you a religious man?

947
01:01:15,072 --> 01:01:17,563
We ain't talking about me.

948
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:19,768
Jack: You believe in God?

949
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:28,948
All right, yes, I do.

950
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:31,920
You ain't got
the slightest idea.

951
01:01:31,955 --> 01:01:34,048
I can hear it
in your voice.

952
01:01:34,091 --> 01:01:37,083
Sheriff:
How should my voice sound?

953
01:01:37,127 --> 01:01:38,719
I want to call my wife.

954
01:01:39,763 --> 01:01:41,993
Sheriff:
How should my voice sound?

955
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:44,592
Simple. Clear.

956
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:48,092
Like to answer the question's
almost strange.

957
01:01:48,138 --> 01:01:50,163
Is that how you believe?

958
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:52,835
Jack: You could never
understand how I believe.

959
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:53,968
Why?

960
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:56,342
You haven't been
as far gone as I have.

961
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:59,576
- How do you know?
- By looking at you.

962
01:01:59,616 --> 01:02:02,176
Okay, fucker.
I've heard enough.

963
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:05,211
- Will...
- God damn it, I have!

964
01:02:05,255 --> 01:02:07,348
He says another word
and I'll strangle myself.

965
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:10,848
- Will...
- The state gave you everything.

966
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:14,330
- It gave you your life back.
- It didn't give me my life.

967
01:02:14,364 --> 01:02:17,390
- Les, get him out of here.
- You'll fry, you prick.

968
01:02:17,434 --> 01:02:19,959
I'm gonna see you fry
if it's the last thing that I do.

969
01:02:20,003 --> 01:02:21,630
"... Fear none of those things... "

970
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:25,300
- Will...
- Take your hands off me!

971
01:02:25,342 --> 01:02:28,869
I'll be there in the front
fucking row when you go!

972
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:30,880
You're going to hell!

973
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,334
"Revelation. "

974
01:02:52,369 --> 01:02:54,633
Jack:
You've read the Bible?

975
01:02:54,671 --> 01:02:56,969
It's more
than most Christians.

976
01:02:57,007 --> 01:02:58,372
He's right.

977
01:02:58,408 --> 01:03:00,968
If this goes to trial,
we'll win.

978
01:03:01,011 --> 01:03:03,172
You'll get the chair.

979
01:03:03,213 --> 01:03:05,681
I want that.

980
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:07,910
I want your life to end.

981
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:13,350
I used to think
a man's life was God's domain.

982
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:15,449
But you've changed that.

983
01:03:26,503 --> 01:03:29,063
You remember this child?

984
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:31,733
He's picked you out
of a mug book.

985
01:03:31,775 --> 01:03:35,802
He looks at your picture
and starts to tremble.

986
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:38,871
He trembles at the sight
of your photograph.

987
01:03:38,915 --> 01:03:39,904
Tom?

988
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:42,248
Sheriff:
His name is Tom Spencer.

989
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:43,980
Will you let me in?

990
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,988
Sheriff:
He's 14 years old.

991
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:48,013
Aunt: Look, you're gonna
have to say something.

992
01:03:48,058 --> 01:03:50,754
I won't tolerate this no more.

993
01:03:51,962 --> 01:03:55,489
That sheriff keeps calling
and asking how you are.

994
01:03:55,532 --> 01:03:56,499
Tom?

995
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:02,534
He sent someone over
for a picture of you.

996
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:04,540
Fancy that, Tom.

997
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:08,036
Tom?

998
01:04:08,078 --> 01:04:09,807
I'm all right.

999
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,837
Well, okay, then.

1000
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:14,509
I'm going to the kitchen now.

1001
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:23,750
Sheriff:
A year and a half ago,

1002
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:25,556
his mother finished
cooking dinner for him

1003
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:27,495
just after the evening news.

1004
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,430
Deedee,
I've got to go out.

1005
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:31,559
Sheriff: And she went to the phone
to call her sister.

1006
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:34,502
A lady who works
at the diner here in town.

1007
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,767
And she said,
"Take care of my boy. "

1008
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:40,372
It's yours.

1009
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,469
She walked out of her house...

1010
01:04:43,513 --> 01:04:46,038
she stepped to the garage...

1011
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:48,107
closed all the doors...

1012
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,715
and started her car.

1013
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,326
It took 48 minutes.

1014
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:04,729
The boy was a wall away.

1015
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:10,839
When he turned off the TV,

1016
01:05:10,874 --> 01:05:12,637
he heard the car.

1017
01:05:25,622 --> 01:05:28,386
I wish I could describe to you...

1018
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:30,757
the confusion and terror...

1019
01:05:31,795 --> 01:05:33,524
I saw in his eyes

1020
01:05:33,563 --> 01:05:37,693
when he'd seen her
being drug out of the garage.

1021
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:43,835
That boy got
nothing to do with me.

1022
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:47,342
We found her body, Jack.

1023
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:55,648
You confess on this tape.

1024
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:59,484
He won't have
to be part of a trial.

1025
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:02,320
The state will use him up
to get to you.

1026
01:06:02,359 --> 01:06:04,691
I want him spared that.

1027
01:06:04,728 --> 01:06:07,663
I'll get to you anyway.

1028
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:10,222
I won't put this boy
through more.

1029
01:06:11,668 --> 01:06:15,229
Maybe God wanted him
to have seen what he's seen.

1030
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:17,569
This got nothing
to do with God.

1031
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:20,098
Everything's got
to do with God.

1032
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:22,737
It's that you
and this whole world's forgot.

1033
01:06:22,779 --> 01:06:25,247
Was God with you
on Friday night?

1034
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:26,908
You don't believe that?

1035
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:30,386
I don't see why he'd let that
happen to one of his children.

1036
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:32,888
God ain't about asking why.

1037
01:06:33,957 --> 01:06:36,289
You never ask why?

1038
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,726
Even if I did,

1039
01:06:39,763 --> 01:06:42,323
think I'd hear an answer?

1040
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:51,907
No, I don't.

1041
01:06:59,916 --> 01:07:02,908
I can save your life.

1042
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:05,477
I spoke with the DA.

1043
01:07:06,823 --> 01:07:10,122
He says if we get a confession,
they won't go for the chair.

1044
01:07:11,161 --> 01:07:13,561
You said you wanted me dead.

1045
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:16,997
It's a trade I can live with.

1046
01:07:18,435 --> 01:07:22,929
You live, and the boy
is spared all that.

1047
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:33,342
I'll turn this on now.

1048
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:35,951
Jack?

1049
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:40,548
I'll turn this on.

1050
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,492
Sheriff: I'm asking you
to see how he is.

1051
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:48,724
I'm tired of this.

1052
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:52,566
All I do
is do for that boy.

1053
01:07:53,603 --> 01:07:56,003
This boy ain't got a mama.

1054
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:59,865
Who do you think
has been his mama?

1055
01:08:01,544 --> 01:08:03,034
I'm making his favorite supper.

1056
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,876
I'm gonna fetch him
when it's ready.

1057
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:08,145
Sheriff: You can't check on it
real quick; right now?

1058
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:11,278
- Aunt: Oh, mercy.
- Sheriff: Please...

1059
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:13,414
I'd like to hear how he is,

1060
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:16,789
and sometimes it's hard to know
through a closed door.

1061
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:19,920
- Aunt: Fine.
- Sheriff: Call me right back.

1062
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:26,295
Hi.

1063
01:08:49,726 --> 01:08:53,093
We advise you
to come back in another day.

1064
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,063
I can't afford a baby.

1065
01:08:55,098 --> 01:08:58,761
I can't afford another
round trip bus ticket.

1066
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:00,769
And you say you're not married?

1067
01:09:02,005 --> 01:09:03,632
I'm not married.

1068
01:09:03,673 --> 01:09:07,302
- Is that the truth?
- Yes, it's the truth.

1069
01:09:15,752 --> 01:09:18,016
Tom?

1070
01:09:18,054 --> 01:09:20,955
Your supper's ready.

1071
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,651
Aunt: Tom?

1072
01:09:23,793 --> 01:09:26,353
Say it to the camera.

1073
01:09:26,396 --> 01:09:28,626
It was me who killed her.

1074
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:30,690
You came down from Kingfisher?

1075
01:09:31,801 --> 01:09:33,598
Sheriff: Killed who?

1076
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:37,128
Jack:
I killed my wife Ainsley.

1077
01:09:38,408 --> 01:09:41,536
Sheriff: Did you know
what you were doing...

1078
01:09:41,578 --> 01:09:43,341
and why?

1079
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:45,142
Yes.

1080
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:47,946
I did.

1081
01:09:51,421 --> 01:09:52,820
Watch her heel.

1082
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,254
Oh God.

1083
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:57,887
Up.

1084
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:08,199
Aunt: All right,
that's enough of this.

1085
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:09,704
I'm coming in.

1086
01:10:09,739 --> 01:10:12,367
You hear me? I'm coming in.

1087
01:10:14,344 --> 01:10:15,777
Tom?

1088
01:10:17,981 --> 01:10:19,414
Tom!

1089
01:10:54,117 --> 01:10:58,146
I'll get you down!

1090
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,489
Sheriff: Faith.

1091
01:11:42,732 --> 01:11:46,691
God tells a man
to sacrifice his son.

1092
01:11:47,737 --> 01:11:50,706
The man has faith,
and he will do it.

1093
01:11:51,741 --> 01:11:53,641
He doesn't ask why.

1094
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:58,205
At least, Abraham...

1095
01:11:58,247 --> 01:12:02,308
as he binds his son,
knows why they're there.

1096
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,947
I don't anymore.

1097
01:12:08,758 --> 01:12:10,692
I see him everywhere...

1098
01:12:10,727 --> 01:12:13,093
a boy I hardly knew.

1099
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:17,024
He doesn't become...

1100
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:18,090
vague...

1101
01:12:19,135 --> 01:12:21,695
like most memories.

1102
01:12:21,738 --> 01:12:23,069
But clearer...

1103
01:12:24,107 --> 01:12:25,699
a ghost...

1104
01:12:27,143 --> 01:12:29,941
in perpetual approach.

1105
01:12:31,614 --> 01:12:34,811
It lingers in the faces
of my children,

1106
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:36,409
grandchildren...

1107
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:38,477
You drive good.

1108
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:41,081
Sheriff:
And she lingers...

1109
01:12:41,124 --> 01:12:44,321
in every woman I'll ever know.

1110
01:12:48,798 --> 01:12:50,231
Hey.

1111
01:12:58,007 --> 01:12:59,668
Hello?

1112
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:04,737
Ainsley?

1113
01:13:04,781 --> 01:13:08,512
- Ainsley: Ain't you gonna get out?
- Tom: You want company?

1114
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:10,883
I don't want
to stand out here alone.

1115
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:23,694
How did you find this place?

1116
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:27,533
My mama brought me here
the day my daddy died.

1117
01:13:29,572 --> 01:13:32,234
She knelt right there,

1118
01:13:32,275 --> 01:13:34,243
and she prayed.

1119
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:41,349
And her and him
used to come here...

1120
01:13:41,384 --> 01:13:43,614
in high school...

1121
01:13:43,653 --> 01:13:45,450
for privacy.

1122
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:50,615
How old are you?

1123
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:54,061
- Just turned 14.
- 14?

1124
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,291
You don't get pulled over?

1125
01:13:56,332 --> 01:13:58,129
Sometimes.

1126
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:00,829
I drive friendly.

1127
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:02,735
Yes, you do.

1128
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:16,345
What do you want to be
when you get older?

1129
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:19,820
I like cars an awful lot.

1130
01:14:22,225 --> 01:14:24,250
Oklahoma City?

1131
01:14:25,895 --> 01:14:28,386
- A mechanic?
- Yeah.

1132
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:33,567
I was going to open
my own restaurant...

1133
01:14:33,603 --> 01:14:36,231
where the oilmen
could come

1134
01:14:36,272 --> 01:14:38,797
for steak and potatoes.

1135
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,642
I was going
to marry one of them,

1136
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:46,011
have big strong boys.

1137
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:49,948
Is that who you're running from?

1138
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:53,422
- Is it an oilman you married?
- No.

1139
01:14:53,456 --> 01:14:56,254
Where did she go?!

1140
01:14:59,061 --> 01:15:01,427
A mechanic I married.

1141
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:13,431
So what are you going to do now?

1142
01:15:13,476 --> 01:15:17,037
I was hoping coming up here
would help me figure that out.

1143
01:15:22,952 --> 01:15:25,352
What are you staring at?

1144
01:15:26,789 --> 01:15:28,552
Your eyes.

1145
01:15:28,591 --> 01:15:30,582
What about them?

1146
01:15:33,062 --> 01:15:36,293
One of them keeps moving off.

1147
01:15:36,332 --> 01:15:38,857
- It does?
- Right there.

1148
01:15:42,939 --> 01:15:44,964
You want to see something?

1149
01:15:58,688 --> 01:16:00,986
- What have you done?
- Don't be afraid.

1150
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:02,786
It's just a glass eye.

1151
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:07,057
Don't get it near me.

1152
01:16:07,096 --> 01:16:08,927
It's glass.

1153
01:16:08,965 --> 01:16:11,195
It's not my real eye.

1154
01:16:15,471 --> 01:16:17,803
Where's your real eye?

1155
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,638
It got cut out
when I was a little girl.

1156
01:16:22,545 --> 01:16:25,776
When my mama told me
I was going to get a new eye,

1157
01:16:25,815 --> 01:16:28,306
I said, make it purple.

1158
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:33,883
'Cause that was
my favorite color.

1159
01:16:36,993 --> 01:16:39,985
- The eye ain't purple.
- Of course not.

1160
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:50,871
You're lucky for that.

1161
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:52,339
The preacher says,

1162
01:16:52,375 --> 01:16:55,503
people with two different
colored eyes are the devil.

1163
01:16:59,315 --> 01:17:01,749
I didn't know that then.

1164
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:13,254
You want to put it back in me?

1165
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:23,899
Not so fast.

1166
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:26,499
Wipe that smudge
from your hand.

1167
01:17:26,542 --> 01:17:29,136
Ain't no smudge.

1168
01:17:29,178 --> 01:17:31,203
Here.

1169
01:17:31,247 --> 01:17:32,942
Hold it soft.

1170
01:17:37,186 --> 01:17:39,177
Slow yourself.

1171
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:54,364
- Does it hurt?
- No more than usual.

1172
01:17:55,404 --> 01:17:57,463
You've done it real gentle.

1173
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,941
Would you come into my arms?

1174
01:18:18,094 --> 01:18:19,857
Ainsley: Yes.

1175
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:25,560
Just children.

1176
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:31,097
That's all we are, Lord,
if you're out there at all.

1177
01:18:33,109 --> 01:18:34,804
Children.

1178
01:18:35,845 --> 01:18:37,836
Your children.

1179
01:18:40,349 --> 01:18:42,613
Boys and girls.

1180
01:18:44,353 --> 01:18:46,412
Forgive us.
