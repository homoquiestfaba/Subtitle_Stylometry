She wants me to raise it.

41

-it's not gonna come back.

They call me...

54
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,088
And... it's like a nickname
for Bobby depressed.

55
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:04,725
It was my older brother Danny
that we lost.

00:17:37,913 --> 00:17:40,711
You know, it's a little jewelry store.
What can I say?

174
00:17:40,783 --> 00:17:43,479
It's business.

175
00:17:43,552 --> 00:17:46,487
What about you?
You still doin' the real estate?

176
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:49,285
Well, it's a tough market
right now.

177
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:52,953
I'm still representing
some properties.

178
00:17:53,028 --> 00:17:58,125
But Roger's been doing so well,
I've been able to back off some.
Spend more time with the kids.

179
00:17:59,235 --> 00:18:02,170
Oh, well, wonderful.

180
00:18:02,238 --> 00:18:07,175
That's, uh, yeah--
That's, uh, really wonderful.

181
00:18:07,243 --> 00:18:09,939
Um--

182
00:18:10,012 --> 00:18:11,980
Um...

183
00:18:13,682 --> 00:18:16,708
Mary, there's, uh, something
that you should know.

184
00:18:16,785 --> 00:18:21,654
It's the reason
I came here.

185
00:18:21,724 --> 00:18:24,557
- Freddy--
- I've got something I wanna tell you.

186
00:18:24,627 --> 00:18:27,960
You made me a promise.
I hope you're gonna keep it.

187
00:18:29,365 --> 00:18:34,166
Two things:
I made you a promise. That's one.

188
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:38,696
And I have great news.
That's two.

189
00:18:38,774 --> 00:18:40,833
Now, you gonna let me speak
or not?

190
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:46,013
I'm sorry.
What's your great news?

191
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:48,709
( Sighs, Muttering )

192
00:18:48,784 --> 00:18:51,753
It's really great news.
I mean, spectacular news.

193
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:56,382
- I'm tellin' ya.
You wanna hear it or not?
- Mm-hmm.

194
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,858
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

195
00:18:58,927 --> 00:19:00,519
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

196
00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:05,266
He's out.

197
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:09,270
John Booth is out.

198
00:19:09,338 --> 00:19:11,272
I'm gonna kill him.

199
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,205
Get out of here, Freddy.

200
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:16,676
I'm not goin' anywhere until I see you
courageous enough to tell the truth.

201
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:19,270
The truth?
What truth, Freddy?

202
00:19:19,348 --> 00:19:22,010
- You promised you wouldn't.
- Wouldn't? Wouldn't what, Mary?

203
00:19:22,084 --> 00:19:25,349
- Mention our daughter? Why?
Because you'd blackmail me?
- Blackmail?

204
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:28,754
If I ever, ever want to speak
to the mother of my children,

205
00:19:28,824 --> 00:19:30,849
I must never mention
my daughter !

206
00:19:30,926 --> 00:19:34,191
- Get out of our house !
- This is my house.

207
00:19:34,263 --> 00:19:37,596
By any natural law,
this is my house !

208
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:41,193
If my children live here,
my children,

209
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:45,263
then who's to say that I can't come here
to see 'em any fuckin' time I want to?

210
00:19:45,341 --> 00:19:48,435
- You had to do it, huh?
- Nobody's talkin' to you !

211
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,104
- You want me to call the police?
- Call whoever the fuck you want.

212
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,343
Where do you get off calling
them your children? You haven't
been a father to those kids.

213
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,977
- You stopped with our daughter.
- Emily is her name.

214
00:19:58,053 --> 00:20:01,420
Yes, Emily. Emily !
And she is dead.

215
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:04,789
But I owe those two little boys
up there all the love I've got.

216
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,694
And it kills you that I can
give it to them and that you can't !

217
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:14,527
( Roger ) Freddy, I want you
to leave our home--

218
00:20:14,603 --> 00:20:18,039
- Tell the truth, Mary. You
want me to kill John Booth !
- Let go of him !

219
00:20:18,107 --> 00:20:22,635
That's my job in life, and your job is
to go on as though nothing happened !

220
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:25,646
- Let go of him !
- Freddy !

221
00:20:25,714 --> 00:20:29,172
Freddy, why don't you let me go?
I'll make us some coffee.

222
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:32,049
Come on.

223
00:20:32,121 --> 00:20:35,147
Coffee. Good.

224
00:20:35,224 --> 00:20:37,385
I'd like some coffee.

225
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:42,419
Why don't we all just sit down,
have some coffee and
talk about this civilly?

226
00:20:42,498 --> 00:20:45,262
Come on.

227
00:20:45,334 --> 00:20:48,929
( Sighs )
You know what?

228
00:20:52,307 --> 00:20:54,867
I don't want any coffee.
I--

229
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:59,877
I don't like coffee at all.
It makes my heart-- ( Slapping Chest )

230
00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:03,247
- You just said you wanted coffee.
- No.

231
00:21:03,318 --> 00:21:05,183
You sure?

232
00:21:05,254 --> 00:21:10,453
Yes. Uh... no.

233
00:21:10,526 --> 00:21:12,756
I'm gonna go.

234
00:21:13,862 --> 00:21:16,922
I feel good.

235
00:21:19,902 --> 00:21:24,862
- He just showed up
at the door. I didn't--
- Jesus, God, Roger.

236
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,875
I just want to say this.

237
00:21:27,943 --> 00:21:30,741
I've done a lot of things
for you, you know.

238
00:21:30,813 --> 00:21:33,043
A lot of things.

239
00:21:33,115 --> 00:21:37,575
And I think it's cheap of you
that you won't hear me out
on things. I really do.

240
00:21:37,653 --> 00:21:41,089
- Mary's just upset.
- Excuse me, but I am not upset.

241
00:21:41,156 --> 00:21:45,354
If you think I'm gonna keep
score on who's done what to who,
you're very fucking wrong !

242
00:21:45,427 --> 00:21:47,918
And if you think that's cheap,
then fuck you !

243
00:21:47,996 --> 00:21:52,228
I don't know if you're serious
about killing this man or not,
but I do know this.

244
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:54,599
It has nothing to do
with our daughter.

245
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:57,366
Our little girl is gone, Freddy,
and she's not coming back...

246
00:21:57,439 --> 00:22:00,499
no matter what you do !

247
00:22:00,576 --> 00:22:04,603
You've never even been to the
cemetery, Freddy. You've never
even been to Emily's grave.

248
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,807
Why?

249
00:22:06,882 --> 00:22:11,649
Because I didn't go to
your little party? Your funeral?

250
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,816
I went on my own time,
Mary... in private.

251
00:22:15,891 --> 00:22:18,485
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

252
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,052
Then you're a braver man
than I thought.

253
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,655
What's the inscription
on the stone, Freddy?

254
00:22:26,168 --> 00:22:28,432
What color is it?

255
00:22:28,504 --> 00:22:31,302
Is it on a hill?
Is it under a tree?

256
00:22:31,373 --> 00:22:34,968
Does it lay flat or does it
stick up out of the ground?

257
00:22:41,617 --> 00:22:44,484
That's what I thought.

258
00:22:46,588 --> 00:22:50,752
Roger, man to man,

259
00:22:50,826 --> 00:22:53,192
when you two read
in the newspaper...

260
00:22:53,262 --> 00:22:56,356
that John Booth
has been shot dead,

261
00:22:56,431 --> 00:23:01,869
I want you to look
into her face and tell me if
you don't see pride and relief.

262
00:23:01,937 --> 00:23:05,532
Pride and relief,
Mary.

263
00:23:21,657 --> 00:23:27,152
## ( Whistling )

264
00:23:36,438 --> 00:23:39,271
## ( Whistling Continues )

265
00:24:07,402 --> 00:24:09,370
( Man ) So, listen to me.

266
00:24:09,438 --> 00:24:11,906
I'm comin' out of the bathroom,
right?

267
00:24:11,974 --> 00:24:14,909
And these two Orientals,
they're arguin', they're hollerin'.

268
00:24:14,977 --> 00:24:17,775
They're screamin'
at one another, and all in Japanese.

269
00:24:17,846 --> 00:24:19,575
So, I told 'em.

270
00:24:19,648 --> 00:24:24,847
I said, "Hey, you're in
America now. Speak Spanish."

271
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:31,726
- Geez, you fucking guys.
Have a miserable evening.
- ( Men Laughing )

272
00:24:31,793 --> 00:24:35,126
- ( Men Laughing )
- What was he doin' in the mens' room?

273
00:24:35,197 --> 00:24:38,792
Hey, Freddy. Freddy.
What?

274
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:40,801
Hey, Freddy, you with us?

275
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:44,066
I think we hypnotized him.
Freddy !

276
00:24:45,307 --> 00:24:48,208
- Yeah?
- He's on the rag.

277
00:24:48,276 --> 00:24:51,768
( Men Laughing )

278
00:24:51,847 --> 00:24:56,580
Did any of you guys ever have
a sound build up in your head...

279
00:24:56,652 --> 00:24:59,485
over a period of days?

280
00:24:59,554 --> 00:25:02,079
Like a vacuum cleaner?

281
00:25:02,157 --> 00:25:06,150
That the last time
you had an original thought,

282
00:25:06,228 --> 00:25:09,026
you got cocky
and rode on it?

283
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:12,624
- Rode what?
- Rode on the thought.

284
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:16,130
Enjoyed it...

285
00:25:17,572 --> 00:25:22,600
'til you started hearin' that
vacuum cleaner in your brain.

286
00:25:22,678 --> 00:25:27,172
- But you don't mean tonight.
- ( Laughing ) No.
He means some other night.

287
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:29,945
Take my advice, Freddy.

288
00:25:30,018 --> 00:25:32,919
Get yourself a "youngie" and go
on one of them Laguna weekends.

289
00:25:32,988 --> 00:25:36,480
( Men Laughing )

290
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:47,529
I gotta take off.
I'll see you guys later.

291
00:25:47,602 --> 00:25:50,366
Freddy, where you goin' ?
It's only 11:00.

292
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:52,202
Oh, man.

293
00:25:52,274 --> 00:25:54,208
Commitments.

294
00:25:54,276 --> 00:25:58,303
He's gonna go turn off the fuckin'
vacuum cleaner ! ( Laughing )

295
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:12,855
( Engine Revving )

296
00:26:12,928 --> 00:26:15,795
( Tires Screeching )

297
00:27:54,996 --> 00:27:57,521
Pride and relief, Mary.

298
00:28:11,713 --> 00:28:14,079
( Groans )

299
00:28:17,018 --> 00:28:18,986
( Gun Clicks )

300
00:28:19,054 --> 00:28:20,988
Goddamn it !

301
00:28:21,056 --> 00:28:23,923
- ( Gun Clicks )
- Goddamn it !

302
00:28:23,992 --> 00:28:27,860
Fuckin'--
Fuckin' clip is empty.

303
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:31,592
This fuckin' gun ain't got
no fuckin' clip. You cock.

304
00:28:36,638 --> 00:28:39,106
All right
I get a cigarette?

305
00:28:42,177 --> 00:28:44,111
All right.

306
00:28:56,925 --> 00:28:58,893
You know--

307
00:29:01,796 --> 00:29:04,629
Would you mind closin' the door?
I don't want to wake my parents.

308
00:29:12,007 --> 00:29:14,942
Might fuckin' wake
his fuckin' parents.

309
00:29:25,954 --> 00:29:27,922
When the thing happened,

310
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,554
I wanted to be dead.

311
00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:42,427
But there wasn't--
You know.

312
00:29:42,504 --> 00:29:45,837
I didn't want
your forgiveness.

313
00:29:45,907 --> 00:29:50,003
I didn't think I deserved it.
And I don't think I do.

314
00:29:53,481 --> 00:29:55,449
But...

315
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,527
I guess you, uh...

316
00:30:08,063 --> 00:30:11,055
you've been waitin' for this day
for a long time.

317
00:30:11,132 --> 00:30:13,896
It's all right.
Sit down.

318
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,374
Sit down.

319
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:25,073
I know it's been
a long wait.

320
00:30:25,146 --> 00:30:28,274
But I'm not goin' anywhere.

321
00:30:31,152 --> 00:30:34,986
I'm not callin' any cops.

322
00:30:35,056 --> 00:30:39,322
I'll just be here,
trying to get on with things.

323
00:30:47,869 --> 00:30:50,030
Would you maybe,
you know--

324
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:56,939
Would you take
a couple days...

325
00:30:57,012 --> 00:31:00,038
and maybe think about
not takin' my life?

326
00:31:00,115 --> 00:31:03,084
Look.

327
00:31:03,151 --> 00:31:07,884
I'm a jeweler.
I got a jewelry store.

328
00:31:07,956 --> 00:31:12,484
That's all I got.
That's it. That's what I am.

329
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,358
- Understand what I'm talkin' about?
- I think I do.

330
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:19,890
Shut up ! Because you don't.
You don't understand. You don't !

331
00:31:22,303 --> 00:31:24,294
All right.

332
00:31:40,522 --> 00:31:44,219
I'm gonna give you
three days.

333
00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:46,351
Three days.

334
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,734
Then maybe I'll remember
the fuckin' clip for this gun.

335
00:31:53,802 --> 00:31:55,429
Son of a bitch !

336
00:31:57,605 --> 00:32:01,632
( Speaking Spanish )

337
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:05,372
( Woman On TV ) And up. Let's go !

338
00:32:05,447 --> 00:32:08,439
We're warming up.
Get that blood flowing.

339
00:32:08,516 --> 00:32:11,815
Again.
Now tuck your arms.

340
00:32:11,886 --> 00:32:15,014
Front and back.
And step.

341
00:32:25,433 --> 00:32:28,596
I don't want another ring.
I want this ring in a size seven.

342
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,661
Don't you understand?

343
00:32:30,738 --> 00:32:34,868
I was a seven on Tuesday and I'm
a seven today. This is not a seven.

344
00:32:34,943 --> 00:32:36,968
( Jefferey ) You have a swollen
finger one day, not the next.

345
00:32:37,045 --> 00:32:39,775
( Woman ) I want to speak to the owner.
It's not a seven.

346
00:32:39,848 --> 00:32:43,045
It's maybe a six,
a six and a half.

347
00:32:43,118 --> 00:32:46,747
- I sized your finger two times.
- I wanted to wear this ring tonight.

348
00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:49,187
I have a very important
engagement tonight.

349
00:32:49,257 --> 00:32:51,725
No, I don't want another ring.
I want this ring...

350
00:32:51,793 --> 00:32:54,284
- in a size seven like I ordered it.
- May I help you, ma'am?

351
00:32:54,362 --> 00:32:58,458
- Are you the owner?
- Yes, I would be
the proprietor in question.

352
00:32:58,533 --> 00:33:03,766
Thank God. I told this Jap faggot
I ordered this ring size seven.

353
00:33:03,838 --> 00:33:06,306
My ring size has always been a seven.
This is not a seven.

354
00:33:06,374 --> 00:33:09,207
- It won't even fit on my hand.
- May I see the ring, please?

355
00:33:09,277 --> 00:33:12,804
Yeah. It won't fit on my finger,
my hand. It won't fit anything.

356
00:33:12,881 --> 00:33:16,044
It's a six and a half.
Six and three-quarters maybe.

357
00:33:19,154 --> 00:33:22,021
Does that look like a
six fuckin' and a half to you?

358
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:26,191
Ahh.

359
00:33:26,261 --> 00:33:28,855
You were right.
You're a perfect seven.

360
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:31,990
A perfect fucking seven.

361
00:33:51,753 --> 00:33:55,780
Do you know where
this bus turns around?

362
00:33:59,394 --> 00:34:01,692
Pardon?

363
00:34:01,763 --> 00:34:05,324
Does this bus stay
in Glendale?

364
00:34:09,704 --> 00:34:12,036
I don't know.

365
00:34:13,608 --> 00:34:17,840
Does it turn around
and come back to Marge Street?

366
00:34:17,912 --> 00:34:19,903
I don't know.

367
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:27,286
- Do you come back to Marge Street?
- No.

368
00:34:31,693 --> 00:34:35,185
My sister has a car.

369
00:34:35,263 --> 00:34:38,027
A Valiant.

370
00:34:40,568 --> 00:34:44,629
-Did you ever get to ride in a Valiant?
-No.

371
00:34:44,706 --> 00:34:48,574
My sister has
a green Valiant.

372
00:34:54,349 --> 00:34:58,251
I ride the bus
all day long.

373

( Laughing )

374
00:35:01,522 --> 00:35:04,218
I have
a disability card...

375
00:35:04,292 --> 00:35:06,624
so I don't have to pay.

376
00:35:06,694 --> 00:35:09,288

00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:47,033

Hello.
Mary Manning.

380
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:22,265
Hello?

381
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:34,143
- Hey, what's in the news?
- Hey ! Get in the car.

382
00:36:34,215 --> 00:36:37,116
Okay, we're late.

383
00:36:37,185 --> 00:36:39,119
- But you got the job.
- Yeah.

384
00:36:39,187 --> 00:36:41,155
- You start at 6:00 in the morning.
- Oh, man.

385
00:36:41,222 --> 00:36:43,656
It's a boat.
It's a good job.

386
00:36:43,725 --> 00:36:47,252
Second, there's a bunch of people
at my house. It's a party for you.

387

- A party?
- Girls.

388
00:36:49,964 --> 00:36:53,525
- Wow.
- But we're not goin' anywhere until--

389

butt-fucked?

But then my kind always do #

of your pockets. Let's hear it.

Let's open up your sphincter...

401
00:37:39,046 --> 00:37:41,241
and let the sunlight in.
Verna !

402
00:37:41,315 --> 00:37:43,249
Oh, Verna,
come on, girl.

403
00:37:43,317 --> 00:37:45,842
You better hurry up.
We're gonna be late. Nicky Blair's !

404
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,911
- I didn't know. Is she goin' ?
- Of course she's goin'.

405
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:53,821
I thought it was just
gonna be you and me. Dinner?

406
00:37:53,895 --> 00:37:56,955
Well, we can't do it
in a restaurant, Verna.

407
00:37:57,031 --> 00:38:00,262
What difference does it make?
Geez.

408
00:38:00,334 --> 00:38:02,962
You wanna go or not?
Come on. Huh?

409
00:38:03,037 --> 00:38:06,495
Whoever wants to go, come on,
let's go. I'll wait in the car.

410
00:38:06,574 --> 00:38:09,338
( Woman ) Hey !

411
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:12,345
The train's
a-movin' on.

412
00:38:12,413 --> 00:38:15,177
Get your stuff.
Get your stuff. Let's go.

413
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:19,379
- Yeah, let's go. Let's have fun.
Let's, ha-ha, party, huh?
- Verna?

414
00:38:19,454 --> 00:38:22,184
( Woman ) And I'm talking
to you before about compassion,
how you have compassion...

415
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:26,386
for people, and you decide every day
who deserves compassion and who doesn't.

416
00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:28,395
That's your spirituality.

417
00:38:28,463 --> 00:38:31,990
If somebody is black and dying on the
street, then they deserve compassion.

418
00:38:32,066 --> 00:38:35,058
And if somebody is rich and their sister
dies, they get a little bit.

419
00:38:35,136 --> 00:38:38,503
But if somebody is rich and they
have a bad day, forget it.

420
00:38:38,573 --> 00:38:43,476
They don't deserve a bit of compassion.
You haven't lived that person's life.

421
00:38:43,544 --> 00:38:47,139
But because they don't have
any identifiable things
that deserve compassion,

422
00:38:47,215 --> 00:38:49,149
you don't give it to them.

423
00:38:49,217 --> 00:38:53,051
Not once have I seen you
do that.

424
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,680
Oh, I make him feel bad.
Let me tell a joke.

425
00:38:55,756 --> 00:38:57,587

00:39:05,132 --> 00:39:07,760
- Hello, Mr. Gale. Good to see you.
- Nick, how are you tonight?

429
00:39:07,835 --> 00:39:09,496
You look so good.
Hello, ladies.

430

Mr. Gale, listen. I've got
a great, great, great booth for you.

431

It's a half a booth, but we're
gonna get the other half--

432
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:17,775
- Here. Take their coats quickly.
- Uh, half a booth?

433
00:39:17,845 --> 00:39:21,178
Yes. But don't worry. We're gonna get
the other booth in about 15 minutes.

434
00:39:21,249 --> 00:39:23,240
- At nine, you mean.
- It's right by the bar.
I couldn't get that one.

435
00:39:23,317 --> 00:39:26,309
- Is it nine?
- No, no. Don't worry about nine.
Here, take this.

436
00:39:26,387 --> 00:39:28,116
Come on, girls.

where she does this incredible work.

- Paper.
- Paper.

449
00:40:06,027 --> 00:40:09,292
You were trying
to represent God.

450
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:14,130
Right? Okay.
Uh, just allow me this.

451
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:17,466
But what she ends up with
is an image of herself.

She looks for God
and she finds,

453
00:40:19,974 --> 00:40:22,875
she finds herself.

501
00:43:14,482 --> 00:43:18,919
- You know. You know about me?
- Peter told me.

502
00:43:18,986 --> 00:43:21,250
Mmm.

503
00:43:26,393 --> 00:43:29,021
The father of the, uh,

504
00:43:30,831 --> 00:43:33,857
the girl I killed,
he threatened to kill me last night.

505
00:43:35,202 --> 00:43:37,636
It was an accident,
right?

506
00:43:39,507 --> 00:43:42,203
Was he serious?
You, you-- Serious?

507
00:43:42,276 --> 00:43:45,211
I think he was serious.

508
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,747
I think he's a serious man.

509
00:43:50,117 --> 00:43:52,176
You're the only person
I've told.

510
00:43:53,254 --> 00:43:55,188
Why?

511
00:43:57,057 --> 00:43:59,048
Well, I--

512
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:04,058
I think I thought
it would be romantic.

513
00:44:11,172 --> 00:44:14,073
Why would you
want to be romantic?

514
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,880
How'd you get
that scar on your head?

515
00:44:25,953 --> 00:44:29,116
Banged my head
against the wall.

516
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:32,626
- ln jail?
- Uh-huh.

517
00:44:34,028 --> 00:44:36,861
You or somebody else?

518
00:44:38,332 --> 00:44:40,425
- You?
- Mm-hmm.

519
00:44:40,501 --> 00:44:42,765
You just couldn't stand jail?

520
00:44:42,837 --> 00:44:46,136
No. I just couldn't
stand me.

521
00:44:51,412 --> 00:44:56,873
Yeah, I was gonna call, but
it got so late, I didn't think
you guys would be up.

522
00:44:56,951 --> 00:44:58,816
( Helen ) Of course we're up !

523
00:44:58,886 --> 00:45:01,320
You just got home.
We want to see you.

524
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:06,059
I'm sorry.
It's just, uh--

525
00:45:06,126 --> 00:45:09,562
- I got the job.
- Ah, good.

526
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:13,657
And Peter and his brother threw me
a coming-home party.

527
00:45:13,734 --> 00:45:15,725
The day
just kinda happened.

528
00:45:15,803 --> 00:45:20,069
- When do you start on the boat?
- Actually in a few hours.

529
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:22,938
Why do you stay out so late
before you start a job?

530
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:27,106
Your friends don't care
if you get any rest.

531
00:45:27,181 --> 00:45:32,050
Something hit me tonight.

532
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:34,587
It was a strange night.

533
00:45:38,459 --> 00:45:40,893
You know, uh,

534
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:48,068
( Sighs )
I've done a horrible thing.

535
00:45:48,135 --> 00:45:50,933
And, uh,

536
00:45:51,005 --> 00:45:53,974
I'm always
gonna feel the guiIt...

537
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:56,168
and remorse.

538
00:45:57,344 --> 00:45:59,904
But...

539
00:46:01,248 --> 00:46:05,685
when you hear about
a thing like that,

540
00:46:05,753 --> 00:46:10,713
about someone who has
to carry a thing like that,

541
00:46:12,626 --> 00:46:16,221
when you're in it,
it's just, it's--

542
00:46:16,297 --> 00:46:18,288
( Sighs )

543
00:46:21,035 --> 00:46:24,368
It's very different...

544
00:46:24,438 --> 00:46:27,339
from what you might think.

545
00:46:30,077 --> 00:46:33,672
( Sighs )
I'm not an unhappy person.

546
00:46:33,747 --> 00:46:38,650
I'm just--
( Clears Throat ) I'm just--

547
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:43,179
I'm someone who has caused
a lot of... unhappiness.

548
00:46:44,792 --> 00:46:48,023
And a person
who's caused death.

549
00:46:57,071 --> 00:47:01,030
I, uh,
I love you...

550
00:47:01,108 --> 00:47:04,737
both so much.

551
00:47:04,812 --> 00:47:09,408
Not just as my parents,
but...

552
00:47:09,483 --> 00:47:12,577
as two people who,

553
00:47:12,653 --> 00:47:17,215
who stood by
and kept giving...

554
00:47:19,593 --> 00:47:23,290
your love... to that person.

555
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:28,134
That person...

556
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:34,539
who has also caused you both
so much pain.

557
00:47:34,608 --> 00:47:39,545
You're our son.
Of course we love you.

558
00:47:39,613 --> 00:47:41,581
No matter what.

559
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:49,753
( Verna ) Let's get this straight,
girl. Everyone gets paid by the hour.

560
00:47:49,823 --> 00:47:54,522
- Listen, I'll see you in a bit.
- Ah, Jefferey. Thank you.
Here, hold this.

561
00:47:54,595 --> 00:47:57,063
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine, thank you.

562
00:47:57,131 --> 00:48:00,623
I'm, uh,
I'm fuckin' delighted.

563
00:48:02,302 --> 00:48:05,738
- Please. We can do
a fashion show outside.
- Thank you.

564
00:48:05,806 --> 00:48:08,639
- Who is that, Jefferey?
- It's my boyfriend Gene.

565
00:48:08,709 --> 00:48:10,870
- Did you get the car?
- Yeah. The car's outside.

566
00:48:10,944 --> 00:48:13,970
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
Okay. All right.
- ( Women ) Finally !

567
00:48:14,048 --> 00:48:17,381
- Are you okay?
- I'm just fuckin' great.

568
00:48:18,552 --> 00:48:21,885
- Thank you.
- I can't get this thing.

569
00:48:22,523 --> 00:48:25,185
- Where's the fuckin' car?
- Over there.

570
00:48:30,631 --> 00:48:34,499
# I might
just change my mind #

571
00:48:34,568 --> 00:48:38,470
# Sometimes
you can never tell #

572
00:48:40,007 --> 00:48:44,569
# Where a story
will unwind #

573
00:48:44,645 --> 00:48:48,274
# How deep is
a shallow well #

574
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:54,685
# Sometimes
you would never guess #

575
00:48:54,755 --> 00:48:57,690
# Who's all talk
and who just might #

576
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:04,395
# Find a way
or lose themselves #

577
00:49:04,465 --> 00:01:10,655
# On the King's Highway
tonight ##
