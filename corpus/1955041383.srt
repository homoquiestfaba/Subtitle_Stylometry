- Eat me.

185
00:11:43,318 --> 00:11:44,718
Incest is taboo. Give me.

186
00:11:44,752 --> 00:11:46,887
Not with your jizz hands.

187
00:11:46,921 --> 00:11:49,924
"Find the ratio of radius
to circumference..."

188
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,926
It should never deviate.
It's Pi r to Pi r squared.

189
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,729
Oh, right.

190
00:11:55,763 --> 00:11:58,166
That's so easy.

191
00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:04,204
Have you and Amy ever...

192
00:12:04,238 --> 00:12:06,741
- I mean, have you guys...
- I wish.

193
00:12:06,775 --> 00:12:08,776
There's always holocaust literature.

194
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,277
Fuck you. I wasn't even...

195
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:12,814
Wailing away reading about the six million?

196
00:12:12,848 --> 00:12:15,284
We will pursue this no further.

197
00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:19,720
What about you?

198
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:22,857
I would have with Lucas, but he never tried

199
00:12:22,891 --> 00:12:25,292
and I don't wanna come off like a slut.

200
00:12:25,326 --> 00:12:26,794
Idiot.

201
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:28,963
- Me or Lucas?
- Both.

202
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:30,864
You think I should have
lost it to that douche bag?

203
00:12:30,898 --> 00:12:33,434
He is a douche bag.

204
00:12:33,468 --> 00:12:34,835
Thanks for telling me.

205
00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:36,804
I hate all the guys who wanna fuck you.

206
00:12:36,838 --> 00:12:39,239
I just said he didn't wanna fuck me.

207
00:12:39,273 --> 00:12:42,910
- Did you blow him?
- Has Amy blown you?

208
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:45,747
- I asked you first.
- Yes.

209
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:47,949
- [chuckles]
- You had Lucas Rapp's tool in your mouth?

210
00:12:47,983 --> 00:12:49,050
Okay, enough.

211
00:12:49,084 --> 00:12:50,785
And he never tried to fuck you.

212
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:53,488
- Never.
- So he's gay.

213
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,422
Maybe.

214
00:12:55,456 --> 00:12:57,791
- Has Amy ever...
- Handjob.

215
00:12:57,825 --> 00:12:59,861
Were you thinking about Anne Frank?

216
00:12:59,895 --> 00:13:02,396
- [chuckles]
- Watching footage of "The Long March."

217
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,930
What?

218
00:13:03,964 --> 00:13:05,532
How do you know this shit?

219
00:13:05,566 --> 00:13:08,002
You're a fucking freak.

220
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,405
[chuckles]

221
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:13,207
Imagine if all the people
who built these brownstones

222
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:15,943
could see the city now.

223
00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:17,545
Mm...

224
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:20,481
It's our ruin or our nirvana.

225
00:13:20,515 --> 00:13:23,450
What's that supposed to mean?

226
00:13:23,484 --> 00:13:26,954
Either we'll extinguish
ourselves... or become God.

227
00:13:26,988 --> 00:13:28,455
Jesus, Hal.

228
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:30,958
What else is there?

229
00:13:30,992 --> 00:13:32,926
[sniffs]

230
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,397
[instrumental music]

231
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:43,271
You can still write.

232
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:46,239
<i>Shit don't go away.</i>

233
00:13:46,273 --> 00:13:49,544
Just don't nobody wanna read it.

234
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,146
<i>Monica know you're down here?</i>

235
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,181
We broke up over a year ago.

236
00:13:54,215 --> 00:13:56,983
Mission on your own then?

237
00:13:57,017 --> 00:13:59,286
- Maybe.
- <i>Fuck that supposed to mean?</i>

238
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,887
Bringin' your obliquity up in here?

239
00:14:00,921 --> 00:14:02,323
This ain't no motherfucking courtroom.

240
00:14:02,357 --> 00:14:04,324
Just finish up.

241
00:14:04,358 --> 00:14:05,959
Look at that.

242
00:14:05,993 --> 00:14:08,363
<i>Boy in the day...</i>

243
00:14:09,464 --> 00:14:11,666
...girl at night...

[sighs]

245
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,311
Nothin' better.

246
00:14:24,345 --> 00:14:26,948
I have a friend outside
that's going to join us.

247
00:14:26,982 --> 00:14:29,349
Friend? What kind of friend?

248
00:14:29,383 --> 00:14:32,252
Helps out with this sort of thing.

249
00:14:32,286 --> 00:14:34,222
Sort of thing?

250
00:14:34,256 --> 00:14:36,692
I'm going to open the door.

251
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:47,968
Hello there.

252
00:14:48,002 --> 00:14:49,502
What's going on, Jeffrey?

253
00:14:49,536 --> 00:14:52,006
Jeffrey has asked me to
help to get you some help.

254
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,641
You a fuckin' narc?

255
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:55,910
I spoke to Dr. Barnes.

256
00:14:55,944 --> 00:14:57,277
Who told my man about Dr. Barnes?

257
00:14:57,311 --> 00:14:59,447
Your father.

258
00:15:01,282 --> 00:15:03,050
Fuck you, man.

259
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:05,286
Hey Joe, Joe, where you going, huh?

260
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,055
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- No! Fuck you, Jeffrey!

261
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:11,324
<i>Fuck you, fuckin' narc
ass, mother fucker!</i>

262
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:13,060
Here's what happens in the next hour!

263
00:15:13,094 --> 00:15:15,128
We pack you up, go to your
doctor, and him and you talk.

264
00:15:15,162 --> 00:15:16,597
Well, you have to have an
appointment to see that motherfucker!

265
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:18,531
And what he say to do, you gonna do.

266
00:15:18,565 --> 00:15:22,069
- I'll do as I please.
- I done took away that right.

267
00:15:22,103 --> 00:15:23,371
Man, I'm gonna see the
police, I'm gonna tell 'em...

268
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:24,972
I'm gonna tell 'em you kidnapping me.

269
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:27,275
I know every police in this precinct.

270
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:30,277
Get you locked up on possession,
take days to even think about

271
00:15:30,311 --> 00:15:32,079
remembering to give you a phone call.

272
00:15:32,113 --> 00:15:35,016
So what you gonna do, do the jail route

273
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,519
or the doctor route?

274
00:15:50,965 --> 00:15:52,433
<i>I needed to tell someone.</i>

275
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:53,968
By all means.

276
00:15:54,002 --> 00:15:56,670
Look, the last thing I
wanted was for you to...

277
00:15:56,704 --> 00:15:58,606
Then... then why do you do specifically

278
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,208
what I asked you not to do?

279
00:16:01,242 --> 00:16:05,946
Because I am scared and
bewildered and confused.

280
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,416
What do you think I am?

281
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,955
- If he says it's...
- Then we tell them.

282
00:16:14,989 --> 00:16:17,090
How?

283
00:16:17,124 --> 00:16:19,560
When? What does one even...

284
00:16:20,695 --> 00:16:23,064
This is what I am talking about.

285
00:16:23,098 --> 00:16:25,699
Why I wanted to speak to
someone who's been a parent.

286
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:28,903
My parent who knows our kids.

287
00:16:32,073 --> 00:16:33,975
Mrs. Zarrow?

288
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,383
Is this at all related to the fertility?

289
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:45,051
<i>Adam asked the same question.</i>

290
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:47,488
There are some studies that
suggest a connection between

291
00:16:47,522 --> 00:16:48,989
progesterone and ovarian cancer

292
00:16:49,023 --> 00:16:51,459
<i>but a large majority
that makes none.</i>

293
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:54,194
The truth of the matter is we... we
won't know for a couple of decades

294
00:16:54,228 --> 00:16:57,164
given the uptick in the use of those drugs.

295
00:16:57,198 --> 00:16:59,166
- It will have been worth it.
- Let's not go there.

296
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,636
<i>I'm gonna have to agree
with your husband.</i>

297
00:17:03,238 --> 00:17:06,139
Dr. Nachtigal will
assist. He's extraordinary.

298
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:07,308
And it's...

299
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:08,309
- <i>Friday.</i>
- Friday.

300
00:17:08,343 --> 00:17:10,579
The earliest I could get.

301
00:17:12,113 --> 00:17:14,615
[train chugging]

302
00:17:25,526 --> 00:17:28,128
- Uh, Jill, Adam?
- Hi, Ray.

303
00:17:28,162 --> 00:17:29,163
You guys have a couple of minutes?

304
00:17:29,197 --> 00:17:30,164
We're leaking on you again?

305
00:17:30,198 --> 00:17:31,131
No. And I got your check.

306
00:17:31,165 --> 00:17:32,733
- I'm gonna go up if that's okay.
- Yeah.

307
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:35,101
<i>Thi... this will just take a
couple of minutes, I promise.</i>

308
00:17:35,135 --> 00:17:36,604
Really, Ray, it's not a good time.

309
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,707
It's about your kids.

310
00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:44,377
What's of course hypocritical
is we're all alike.

311
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:45,646
How's that?

312
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,515
Over-educated, irrepressibly ambitious.

313
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:51,152
Moved out to the suburbs,
thought it would be perfect

314
00:17:51,186 --> 00:17:54,487
but without the bank or
the law firm or whatever

315
00:17:54,521 --> 00:17:57,090
what's left, but to polish our children

316
00:17:57,124 --> 00:18:01,061
and obsess over every little offense.

317
00:18:01,095 --> 00:18:02,362
More?

318
00:18:02,396 --> 00:18:04,531
I think I'll switch to wine.

319
00:18:04,565 --> 00:18:07,435
Stems are in the left cabinet.

320
00:18:07,469 --> 00:18:09,336
You know her math challenged son

321
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:12,072
already says he's going to mommy's college?

322
00:18:12,106 --> 00:18:13,640
- <i>What college?</i>
- Princeton.

323
00:18:13,674 --> 00:18:15,142
Of course.

324
00:18:15,176 --> 00:18:18,646
It's utterly heinous,
the level of entitlement.

325
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,081
As if I would already
know that Allie and Angie

326
00:18:21,115 --> 00:18:22,249
were going to Dartmouth.

327
00:18:22,283 --> 00:18:24,685

I'll send you the website.

From all over the world right to your door.

331
00:18:29,824 --> 00:18:33,226
The shipping fees are less
than what the taxes would be.

332
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,297
What I will say is next to no caregivers

333
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:39,166
all moms... but still

334
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,203
I thought by leaving Manhattan
I was through with it.

335
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:45,638
This is worse because all
of the conniving and ambition

336
00:18:45,672 --> 00:18:47,575
are less artfully concealed.

337
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:48,943
Don't lose sight of how lucky you are.

338
00:18:48,977 --> 00:18:51,712
- [telephone ringing]
- Morning on the other side of the world!

339
00:18:51,746 --> 00:18:53,746
- That will be husband.
- I'll check on the girls.

340
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,349
Thanks, Mere.

00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,819
- Hello!
- <i>Angie?</i>

Oh, you know, just keeping it all moving.

343
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:03,557
About to have dinner.

344
00:19:03,591 --> 00:19:05,759
Meredith came out.

345
00:19:05,793 --> 00:19:08,162
I know.

346
00:19:08,196 --> 00:19:09,896
How's China?

348
00:19:10,832 --> 00:19:14,335
Well, what do you want me to ask you?

349
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:16,537
I know.

350
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:19,673
Allie is sick, but it will pass.

351
00:19:19,707 --> 00:19:22,175
When are you coming back?

352
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:25,313
No, no, everything is fine. I'm just...

353
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:29,184
You do want to come home though.

354
00:19:30,485 --> 00:19:33,154
Promise?

355
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:35,889
No, I know, sure.

00:19:54,942 --> 00:19:56,777
Mm.

363
00:20:03,317 --> 00:20:05,753
[indistinct chattering]

364
00:20:07,221 --> 00:20:09,589
Hello there.

365
00:20:09,623 --> 00:20:11,358
I beg your pardon.

366
00:20:11,392 --> 00:20:13,695
Can't a man greet a woman in the street?

367
00:20:15,363 --> 00:20:16,763
Is it Friday?

368
00:20:16,797 --> 00:20:19,366
Just mixing things up.

369
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,202
You were going to call.

370
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:22,869
Did you have lunch with Adam?

371
00:20:22,903 --> 00:20:25,906
- What did he want?
- To catch up.

372
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,340
Where were you headed?

373
00:20:27,374 --> 00:20:28,943
I'm craving chocolate.

374
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,845
Mind if I join?

375
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:33,379
You lecture today?

376
00:20:33,413 --> 00:20:36,684
Schopenhauer's take on erotic striving.

377
00:20:36,718 --> 00:20:39,552
By my age, he was living with poodles.

378
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:43,723
He said, "Marriage was to
reach into a sack of snakes

379
00:20:43,757 --> 00:20:44,791
and find an eel."

380
00:20:44,825 --> 00:20:47,394
[laughing]

381
00:20:47,428 --> 00:20:50,231
Mine is a life in which
the thinkers I admire

382
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:53,267
contradict the reality I inhabit.

383
00:20:53,301 --> 00:20:55,569
Well, that's a relief.

384
00:20:55,603 --> 00:20:57,503
I'm gonna retire.

385
00:20:57,537 --> 00:20:59,272
What?

386
00:20:59,306 --> 00:21:00,608
At the end of the year.

387
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:03,111
My spring-load is light, then I'm done.

388
00:21:05,313 --> 00:21:08,415
And you're telling me this
on a chance walk to the deli?

389
00:21:08,449 --> 00:21:10,650
- When else?
- Why?

390
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:13,820
I always said when I was done I'd know it.

391
00:21:13,854 --> 00:21:15,723
I've been suspicious for some time.

392
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:18,591
- <i>Suspicion is hardly...</i>
- I'm certain.

393
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,859
What are you gonna do?

394
00:21:19,893 --> 00:21:23,396
Wake up and not have any idea.

395
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:26,332
I've got a decade left, maybe 2.

396
00:21:26,366 --> 00:21:27,533
<i>I want possibility.</i>

397
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:28,969
It's all you've ever done.

398
00:21:29,003 --> 00:21:31,972
And my life has been incredibly fulfilling.

399
00:21:32,006 --> 00:21:34,274
I've been decent, honest, loyal.

400
00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:36,542
- I've worked hard.
- Yes.

401
00:21:36,576 --> 00:21:40,047
I've also been perpetually
and resolutely safe.

402
00:21:40,081 --> 00:21:42,883
It's a threshold, Marcia.

403
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:45,586
There for a moment, then gone.

404
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:49,689
I've spent my life delving
into what it all means.

405
00:21:49,723 --> 00:21:51,524
I wanna see for myself

406
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:54,828
without the reassurance of young adoration.

407
00:21:54,862 --> 00:21:57,998
And will it be alright
if I still adore you?

408
00:21:58,032 --> 00:22:01,335
More essential than ever.

409
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:04,471
Let's get you chocolate.

410
00:22:04,505 --> 00:22:06,040
I really think we should give it an hour.

411
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,375
- A half hour even.
- Not happening.

412
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:09,376
Just to put it in perspective.

413
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,512
Particularly with the
sort of week it's been.

414
00:22:11,546 --> 00:22:12,780
Hal! Ella!

415
00:22:12,814 --> 00:22:15,482
Get your asses down here.

416
00:22:15,516 --> 00:22:17,318
If you're gonna interrogate us like this

417
00:22:17,352 --> 00:22:18,585
which based on the stories
you and dad have told us

418
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:19,453
will be patently hypocritical...

419
00:22:19,487 --> 00:22:20,553
I swear to you, Hal, if you don't cut

420
00:22:20,587 --> 00:22:23,022
the lawyerly bullshit, I
am gonna smack you so hard

421
00:22:23,056 --> 00:22:24,491
you're gonna come to in New Jersey.

422
00:22:24,525 --> 00:22:26,694
Jill...

423
00:22:26,728 --> 00:22:28,361
Answer the question.

424
00:22:28,395 --> 00:22:30,063
Once a week? More?

425
00:22:30,097 --> 00:22:31,165
<i>Three times? Every day?</i>

426
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:33,867
Again, I'm sorry, I reject
the inquisitional tone.

427
00:22:33,901 --> 00:22:36,837
Hal, if you ever wanted to do me a favor

428
00:22:36,871 --> 00:22:38,038
just play ball here.

429
00:22:38,072 --> 00:22:39,939
What the hell is going on?

430
00:22:39,973 --> 00:22:42,342
You've been getting
baked daily it would seem

431
00:22:42,376 --> 00:22:43,743
in full view of our neighbors.

432
00:22:43,777 --> 00:22:45,445
But why the rage and hysteria?

433
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:47,614
Why do you cry every
day for the last 3 weeks?

434
00:22:47,648 --> 00:22:49,483
- Ella, please.
- Seriously, you guys must have...

435
00:22:49,517 --> 00:22:52,086
Oh, my God, it's all crashing down.

436
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,556
Guys, answer the question.

437
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,025
Fine. At least daily.

438
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:01,561
Even more than that. Whenever possible.

439
00:23:01,595 --> 00:23:03,129
- <i>Where do you get it?</i>
- Mm-mm.

440
00:23:03,163 --> 00:23:04,064
You're telling us, Hal.

441
00:23:04,098 --> 00:23:05,432
Not unless you want me changing schools.

442
00:23:05,466 --> 00:23:06,800
A kid in your class?

443
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:08,534
Yeah, would you rather
I buy it on the streets?

444
00:23:08,568 --> 00:23:09,535
Would that make you feel better?

445
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:10,604
It's pot, dad.

446
00:23:10,638 --> 00:23:12,705
Ultimately less potent
than the 4 glasses of wine

447
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:14,140
you drink every night.

448
00:23:14,174 --> 00:23:15,775
And I'm first in my class by miles

449
00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:16,777
what the fuck difference does it make?

450
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:18,846
Don't disrespect your father.

451
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,147
Did you seriously just say disrespect?

452
00:23:21,181 --> 00:23:24,451
What is going on here?

453
00:23:24,485 --> 00:23:26,454
Anyone?

454
00:23:28,456 --> 00:23:30,291
<i>Go ahead.</i>

455
00:23:38,932 --> 00:23:42,802
A tumor has been discovered on
one of your mother's ovaries.

456
00:23:42,836 --> 00:23:45,138
Oh, shit.

457
00:23:45,172 --> 00:23:46,807
<i>She is having a
procedure this Friday.</i>

458
00:23:46,841 --> 00:23:48,509
<i>They'll have her in the
hospital for the night</i>

459
00:23:48,543 --> 00:23:50,810
and in bed for a lot of the weekend.

460
00:23:50,844 --> 00:23:53,714
So I think you can understand
why the timing of this...

461
00:23:53,748 --> 00:23:56,817
So, um, I'm sorry, as
in, uh, as in malignant?

462
00:23:56,851 --> 00:23:58,117
Jesus, Hal!

463
00:23:58,151 --> 00:24:00,454
<i>Possibly, yes.</i>

464
00:24:00,488 --> 00:24:04,457
It's largely now, it's just a
question of whether it's spread.

465
00:24:04,491 --> 00:24:08,128
Look, guys, whatever
happens, we're gonna deal.

466
00:24:09,896 --> 00:24:12,465
[sniffles]

467
00:24:12,499 --> 00:24:14,100
I know.

468
00:24:14,134 --> 00:24:18,137
Just stop smoking pot
on the roof or anywhere.

469
00:24:18,171 --> 00:24:19,505
We will.

470
00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:21,575
You promise?

471
00:24:21,609 --> 00:24:24,012
I promise.

472
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,016
[Ella sniffles]

473
00:24:34,622 --> 00:24:37,392
You know this motherfucker
think I'm crazy, right?

474
00:24:38,593 --> 00:24:41,028
Crazy is a tricky word, Joe.

475
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,862
You hear this shit?

476
00:24:42,896 --> 00:24:44,130
Been dealing with that since grade school.

477
00:24:44,164 --> 00:24:46,968
Motherfucker twists every word
that comes out of your mouth.

478
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:53,106
Okay, Shani.

479
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,242
Oh, fine-looking woman that Shani.

480
00:24:55,276 --> 00:24:57,144
- <i>That's enough, Joe.</i>
- Fine habiliments too.

481
00:24:57,178 --> 00:24:58,111
I said that's enough, Joe.

482
00:24:58,145 --> 00:25:01,048
Oh, Shani don't mind being told she fine.

483
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,550
Got 'em kind of legs that don't stop.

484
00:25:03,584 --> 00:25:06,019
Goodbye, Dr. Barnes.

485
00:25:07,555 --> 00:25:09,556
- Which one of you is Jeffrey?
- I am.

486
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,059
- I told you explicitly...
- I know. I know.

487
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,560
First of all, I would like
you to meet Cedar Lemons.

488
00:25:14,594 --> 00:25:16,096
And we truly appreciate you seeing us

489
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,064
after what I know must
have been an arduous day.

490
00:25:18,098 --> 00:25:19,466
You lay that shit on, Jeffrey.

491
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,602
<i>That woman was a patient.
I'm running a practice here.</i>

492
00:25:22,636 --> 00:25:23,936
We're truly sorry.

493
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,172
And there's no point to any of this

494
00:25:25,206 --> 00:25:26,173
unless Joe is on board.

495
00:25:26,207 --> 00:25:27,674
Joe is on board.

496
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:28,742
I need to hear that from Joe.

497
00:25:28,776 --> 00:25:29,976
On board, doctor.

498
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,878
<i>I've heard that before.</i>

499
00:25:31,912 --> 00:25:35,581
Uh, just got to make things right.

500
00:25:35,615 --> 00:25:38,117
- Get my equilibrium.
- <i>Not in here, Joe.</i>

501
00:25:38,151 --> 00:25:40,987
- Oh, come on, doctor.
- Joe, listen to me.

502
00:25:41,021 --> 00:25:42,623
Not in here.

503
00:25:42,657 --> 00:25:45,093
There's a bathroom down the hall.

504
00:25:49,997 --> 00:25:51,231
Where you goin', bitch?

505
00:25:51,265 --> 00:25:54,568
Wherever you go. Like wine on rice.

506
00:25:54,602 --> 00:25:56,270
And you don't disrespect me

507
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,771
or Jeffrey or the doctor here, no more.

508
00:25:57,805 --> 00:25:59,705
Shit's done. You got that?

509
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:01,575
Got it.

510
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:07,146
So he wants to shoot up and you allow that?

511
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,417
I run a psychiatric office, not a precinct.

512
00:26:10,684 --> 00:26:11,551
How do you know Joe?

513
00:26:11,585 --> 00:26:12,919
We grew up together.

514
00:26:12,953 --> 00:26:14,186
You're paying for the muscle?

515
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,557
- His father.
- I met him.

516
00:26:16,591 --> 00:26:18,625
Difficult man, but obviously smart.

517
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:19,992
Joe's smarter.

518
00:26:20,026 --> 00:26:21,595
Would be tough to argue
that right at this moment.

519
00:26:21,629 --> 00:26:23,030
You don't seem to like Joe much.

520
00:26:23,064 --> 00:26:24,264
I love Joe.

521
00:26:24,298 --> 00:26:27,935
I spent 4 years confronting
the tragedy that is Joe. Smart?

522
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:30,236
Imagine what he could have been.

523
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,105
We get him across the
street, I can keep him in

524
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:35,075
until he signs himself
out, which he will do.

525
00:26:35,109 --> 00:26:36,810
You're gonna be there to pick him up?

526
00:26:36,844 --> 00:26:39,980
I'm leaving for Delaware.

527
00:26:40,014 --> 00:26:41,783
[sighs]

528
00:26:44,017 --> 00:26:45,918
He'll be out of his mind with no money.

529
00:26:45,952 --> 00:26:47,788
He has a history of theft.

530
00:26:47,822 --> 00:26:50,158
- <i>I know.</i>
- And violence.

531
00:26:51,325 --> 00:26:53,894
I'm not gonna follow him around
and clearly you're not either.

532
00:26:53,928 --> 00:26:56,329
I need to do this.

533
00:26:56,363 --> 00:26:58,799
Not just across the street.

534
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:02,670
Inside. Where he signs his name.

535
00:27:10,244 --> 00:27:11,677
Just a second.

536
00:27:11,711 --> 00:27:13,914
Just a second.

537
00:27:13,948 --> 00:27:15,381
- Joe.
- Well, fuck you, man.

538
00:27:15,415 --> 00:27:17,917
I'm just makin' sure I've
got everything I need.

Friends of mine are having
there kids in their 40s.

To choosing a life that
relates directly to very few

755
00:37:21,355 --> 00:37:23,323
but quite directly to everyone.

756

Fooling ourselves?

At the heart of human interaction

760
00:37:31,364 --> 00:37:34,867
is the agreement that we're
all going to fabricate.

761
00:37:34,901 --> 00:37:38,271
Which is to say, agree on
certain precepts we call truths

762
00:37:38,305 --> 00:37:41,975
but would be utter nonsense
to anyone not in on the game.

763
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,776
Consider language.

764
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:47,312
We call an elephant an elephant

765
00:37:47,346 --> 00:37:50,783
with a certainty that will
go so far as to marginalize

766
00:37:50,817 --> 00:37:53,486
even ostracize those who refuse.

767
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,856
Society depends zealously on
this, so we can structure it.

768
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:01,361
In this case, communicate with one another

769
00:38:01,395 --> 00:38:04,296

To know that I'm here.

00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:25,377
There is a woman that
I've started to see, yeah.

<i>Is she aware of this?</i>

787

You have to tell her.

Will you come with me?

789
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,502
Well, you know Mr. Cohen
already makes me paranoid enough.

But that's 2 hours from now.

Besides, he's harmless.

792
00:39:53,172 --> 00:39:55,675
All you have to do is
use the word dichotomy

793
00:39:55,709 --> 00:39:57,042
and he'll eat out of your hand.

794
00:39:57,076 --> 00:39:59,579
I still don't know what that word means.

795
00:39:59,613 --> 00:40:01,680
He actually misuses it.

796
00:40:01,714 --> 00:40:03,816
Specifically it's the rhetorical
contrasting of 2 opposing

797
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:06,486
or divergent ideas,
thus, the prefix dicho, 2

798

and then tomy, meaning to cut.

...my parents will be away.

No, asshole.

It's because I want to.

808
00:40:44,524 --> 00:40:47,426
So it's not a sympathy thing?

809
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,562
If you ask me that one more time

810
00:40:48,596 --> 00:40:52,698

I'm just hungry like a motherfucker.

903
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:33,812
We're gonna get you food, bring you water.

904
00:45:33,846 --> 00:45:35,448
You got some crack I can smoke?

905
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:36,716
I'm afraid not.

906
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,783
You know, just a little bit.

907
00:45:38,817 --> 00:45:42,021
Fire that shit up.

908
00:45:42,055 --> 00:45:45,256
Motherfucker!

909
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:47,727
Motherfucker!

910
00:45:47,761 --> 00:45:50,095
Fuck you!

911
00:45:50,129 --> 00:45:51,497
Fuck you!

912
00:45:51,531 --> 00:45:52,832
Fuck you!

913
00:45:52,866 --> 00:45:55,302
Fuck you! Fuck it!

914
00:45:57,203 --> 00:46:00,273
<i>We were just out of school...</i>

915
00:46:01,306 --> 00:46:03,743
...living uptown.

916
00:46:03,777 --> 00:46:05,845
We both had really lucrative job offers.

917
00:46:05,879 --> 00:46:08,280
She was gonna maybe go to London.

918
00:46:08,314 --> 00:46:12,984
Chose the Far East instead to be with me.

919
00:46:13,018 --> 00:46:17,290
The next logical step
was marriage and kids...

920
00:46:18,792 --> 00:46:23,230
...and we just did that, kind
of without even discussing it.

921
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:27,499
2 hyper-educated young adults

922
00:46:27,533 --> 00:46:29,368
making the most
significant decision in life

923
00:46:29,402 --> 00:46:31,905
without a single real conversation.

924
00:46:33,939 --> 00:46:35,874
We talked about movies we saw

925
00:46:35,908 --> 00:46:38,777
more than the meaning of a future together.

926
00:46:41,915 --> 00:46:44,750
I remember being, um...

927
00:46:46,185 --> 00:46:49,522
...what would the word be...

928
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:53,627
...frozen when she was
pregnant the first time.

929
00:46:55,995 --> 00:46:57,864
I thought...

930
00:46:58,931 --> 00:47:01,332
...oh...

931
00:47:01,366 --> 00:47:05,571
...you know, something is definitely over.

932
00:47:05,605 --> 00:47:08,173
And I never stopped to enjoy it.

933
00:47:08,207 --> 00:47:11,276
But you like having kids.

934
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:14,446
I love having kids.

935
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:21,319
I get home, you know,
usually too late for dinner.

936
00:47:21,353 --> 00:47:25,858
She's... into her third drink

937
00:47:25,892 --> 00:47:28,593
and I have about an hour before
the girls have to go to bed

938
00:47:28,627 --> 00:47:33,799
and I go into their rooms with
a plate, and I-I don't leave.

939
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:40,004
Most of our interactions these days

940
00:47:40,038 --> 00:47:44,577
consist of algebra and whatever

941
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:46,879
self-consciously
multi-cultural book

942
00:47:46,913 --> 00:47:48,515
they're reading at the time.

943
00:47:51,917 --> 00:47:55,254
As they get older, they get...

944
00:47:55,288 --> 00:47:57,357
...quieter.

945
00:47:59,024 --> 00:48:01,559
The older one, Allie, she's,
uh, she's getting belligerent.

946
00:48:01,593 --> 00:48:03,930
Mmm.

947
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:07,500
Your wife drinks 'cause
you're not really there.

948
00:48:13,172 --> 00:48:16,508
Yeah, that's obviously part of that.

949
00:48:16,542 --> 00:48:19,379
[sighs]

950
00:48:20,413 --> 00:48:23,249
Not exactly the raucous time
we were thinking of, huh?

951
00:48:23,283 --> 00:48:26,551
[both chuckle]

952
00:48:26,585 --> 00:48:28,653
Honest.

953
00:48:28,687 --> 00:48:31,790
- That's ironic.
- Mmm.

954
00:48:39,131 --> 00:48:41,834
I don't wanna go home yet.

955
00:48:42,968 --> 00:48:45,404
You have to, Sam.

956
00:48:52,511 --> 00:48:54,979
Just one more day.

957
00:48:55,013 --> 00:48:57,816
She's not expecting me yet.

958
00:49:06,591 --> 00:49:08,694
One more day.

959
00:49:10,263 --> 00:49:12,430
Are there friends you can speak to?

960
00:49:12,464 --> 00:49:14,066
Your father?

961
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,267
Your brother, Hal, isn't it?

962
00:49:16,301 --> 00:49:18,704
What is this with me
needing to talk to anyone?

963
00:49:18,738 --> 00:49:21,539
Just to know, others are
concerned and care about you.

964
00:49:21,573 --> 00:49:23,475
And you believe that?

965
00:49:23,509 --> 00:49:25,944
That people care about each other?

966
00:49:25,978 --> 00:49:28,013
We treat people the way
we want to be treated.

967
00:49:28,047 --> 00:49:30,115
It's just a compassion.

968
00:49:30,149 --> 00:49:33,017
I don't consider myself compassionate.

969
00:49:33,051 --> 00:49:35,019
I have no respect for my father

970
00:49:35,053 --> 00:49:38,057
because he is bossed around by my mother.

971
00:49:38,091 --> 00:49:40,725
<i>Now, I not only hate her</i>

972
00:49:40,759 --> 00:49:43,430
but I resent her...

973
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:47,999
...because it's interfering with my life.

974
00:49:48,033 --> 00:49:50,301
<i>All of this is natural.</i>

975
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:54,673
And... pretty fucked up too.

976
00:49:54,707 --> 00:49:56,240
You're young.

977
00:49:56,274 --> 00:49:58,343
You don't want your life interrupted.

978
00:49:58,377 --> 00:50:01,513
I love her so much.

979
00:50:05,317 --> 00:50:06,517
<i>Hello, Joe.</i>

980
00:50:06,551 --> 00:50:09,021
Fucking let me out of here.

981
00:50:09,055 --> 00:50:11,756
In about 20 hours, you will
be able to sign yourself out.

982
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:13,658
So let's skip the fucking hassle.

983
00:50:13,692 --> 00:50:17,495
By law, I've got to hold you for 48 hours.

984
00:50:17,529 --> 00:50:20,031
Hold a man that wasn't hurtin' nobody.

985
00:50:20,065 --> 00:50:22,633
Come into his apartment uninvited

986
00:50:22,667 --> 00:50:25,238
chuck him in a hospital, strap him down.

987
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:30,676
If you could kill yourself
right now, would you?

988
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:32,745
[chuckles]

989
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,146
Ain't gonna kill myself.

990
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,446
<i>You'll be dead in a year.</i>

991
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,149
You told me that last year.

992
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:39,084
<i>Last year I gave you 2 years.</i>

993
00:50:39,118 --> 00:50:40,452
We're right on schedule.

994
00:50:40,486 --> 00:50:42,553
<i>Tell that nurse to
bring me my dinner.</i>

995
00:50:42,587 --> 00:50:45,457
- Not until I...
- <i>I don't think you understand.</i>

996
00:50:45,491 --> 00:50:49,094
You are not here anymore.

997
00:50:52,297 --> 00:50:54,734
[indistinct chatter]

998
00:50:56,301 --> 00:50:58,403
Is that what you were
expecting, Mr. Clancy?

999
00:50:58,437 --> 00:51:00,238
It's opening up.

1000
00:51:00,272 --> 00:51:01,539
You want to try something else?

1001
00:51:01,573 --> 00:51:02,740
I'm good. Thanks.

1002
00:51:02,774 --> 00:51:04,642
Hello, Jeffrey.

1003
00:51:04,676 --> 00:51:06,745
You too?

1004
00:51:06,779 --> 00:51:09,180
- Where is Devlin?
- He's here. The full team.

1005
00:51:09,214 --> 00:51:10,548
Care to join me?

1006
00:51:10,582 --> 00:51:11,749
Think we can be nice to each other?

1007
00:51:11,783 --> 00:51:14,653
<i>I'm optimistic.</i>

1008
00:51:14,687 --> 00:51:17,488
- Excuse me.
- His name's Jerry.

1009
00:51:17,522 --> 00:51:19,390
First name basis.

1010
00:51:19,424 --> 00:51:22,294
- Hey, Jerry, this is Rachel.
- Yeah.

1011
00:51:22,328 --> 00:51:23,694
I'm arguing against her in the morning.

1012
00:51:23,728 --> 00:51:24,729
Make sure she is hungover.

1013
00:51:24,763 --> 00:51:26,164
[Rachel chuckles]

1014
00:51:26,198 --> 00:51:28,367
I'll just have a glass
of that and see a menu.

1015
00:51:28,401 --> 00:51:29,401
<i>Sure thing.</i>

1016
00:51:29,435 --> 00:51:31,603
- [cell phone ringing]
- Shit.

1017
00:51:32,872 --> 00:51:34,673
I have to make a phone call.

1018
00:51:34,707 --> 00:51:37,143

Yeah, who this?

1022
00:51:53,326 --> 00:51:55,227
Hey, buddy, how you faring?

1023
00:51:55,261 --> 00:51:56,095
How am I faring?

1024
00:51:56,129 --> 00:51:58,430
What am I, on a motherfuckin' yacht?

1025
00:51:58,464 --> 00:52:01,233
- How are you, Joe?
- <i>You fucking left town.</i>

1026
00:52:01,267 --> 00:52:02,801
I had no choice.

1027
00:52:02,835 --> 00:52:04,870
<i>You always got a choice.</i>

1028
00:52:04,904 --> 00:52:06,772
Even I know that and I'm
a motherfucking junkie.

<i>A case I've been
working on for 8 months.</i>

1030
00:52:09,774 --> 00:52:13,678
So, that's more important than your
friend that you just dumped in a detox?

1031
00:52:13,712 --> 00:52:16,180
To a company with $700
million at stake, it is.

1032
00:52:16,214 --> 00:52:19,118
Oh, so that is supposed to
belittle me, make me feel small.

1033
00:52:19,152 --> 00:52:21,687
What you workin' for Warren Fucking Buffet?

1034
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:24,555
<i>Maybe you could've picked
another day to fuckin' commit me.</i>

1035

Hasn't your dad been down?

1036
00:52:27,326 --> 00:52:29,193
<i>When I was asleep.</i>

1037
00:52:29,227 --> 00:52:31,162
- Well, he'll be back.
- For what?

1038
00:52:31,196 --> 00:52:33,564
<i>Says he kept you afloat
for the past 5 years.</i>

1039
00:52:33,598 --> 00:52:35,167
And pay for 4 years at Amherst.

<i>When you comin' back?</i>

1042
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:41,272
Depends on how long the case lasts.

1043
00:52:41,306 --> 00:52:45,144
Hey, man, how much, uh, you make a year?

1044

<i>I read in the newspapers,

<i>2 million plus if you're
a partner at a big firm.</i>

We are not discussing that.

Okay, so what are we going to
discuss because you called my ass.

1048

- I have to go, Joe.
- Why you hanging up so fast?

- I'm in a meeting.

00:55:06,419 --> 00:55:08,754
I'm gonna stay at Greg's tonight.

1080
00:55:08,788 --> 00:55:10,888
Pardon?

1081
00:55:10,922 --> 00:55:12,591
Greg's. He needs, uh...

1082
00:55:12,625 --> 00:55:15,459
Are you aware that your
mother is having surgery?

1083
00:55:15,493 --> 00:55:17,296
Yes, I thought you'd
want me out of the house.

1084
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:19,497
No, you want to go to Greg's and get stoned

1085
00:55:19,531 --> 00:55:21,133
'cause it's harder to do that here now.

1086
00:55:21,167 --> 00:55:24,836
- That's actually not the case.
- We're gonna be together this weekend as a family.

1087
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:26,872
That means while your mom
and I are at the hospital

1088
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:28,439
you're home with Ella.

1089
00:55:28,473 --> 00:55:29,573
Okay. That's all you had to say.

1090
00:55:29,607 --> 00:55:32,178
I just wish I hadn't.

1091
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:35,548
[grunts]

1092
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:38,383
<i>The best thing you can do for
me is to ace that history test.</i>

1093
00:55:38,417 --> 00:55:39,984
I got it postponed.

1094
00:55:40,018 --> 00:55:41,452
Ella, don't do that.

1095
00:55:41,486 --> 00:55:42,988
You could take it with your eyes closed.

1096
00:55:43,022 --> 00:55:44,522
<i>Well, I'm not going to.</i>

1097
00:55:44,556 --> 00:55:46,957
What are you going to
do during that period?

1098
00:55:46,991 --> 00:55:48,426
<i>Talk with Mr. Werth.</i>

1099
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:50,329
Can't you talk with him during a free?

1100
00:55:50,363 --> 00:55:51,997
I don't want to.

1101
00:55:52,031 --> 00:55:54,533
Why do you care? I'll take it next week.

1102
00:55:54,567 --> 00:55:56,702
I need to feel like your life is going on.

1103
00:55:56,736 --> 00:55:57,968
That it will go on.

1104
00:55:58,002 --> 00:55:59,771
I'd want it to stop for me.

1105
00:55:59,805 --> 00:56:01,606
You won't when you're a mom.

1106
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:02,874
<i>Yes, I will.</i>

1107
00:56:02,908 --> 00:56:04,776
Just take the fucking test.

1108
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:08,047
Honey, we should go.

1109
00:56:13,518 --> 00:56:16,655
Why do we always have to
play stringed instruments?

1110
00:56:16,689 --> 00:56:18,457
It's good for your brain.

1111
00:56:18,491 --> 00:56:20,792
So is math and science. So is reading.

1112
00:56:20,826 --> 00:56:23,762
<i>Presumably you're being
taught those subjects as well.</i>

1113
00:56:23,796 --> 00:56:26,631
They could teach them more and
ditch the hours of violin every week.

1114
00:56:26,665 --> 00:56:29,468
Besides, she doesn't let us play any notes.

1115
00:56:29,502 --> 00:56:30,535
What do you do?

1116
00:56:30,569 --> 00:56:31,502
<i>Spend the first 3 months</i>

1117
00:56:31,536 --> 00:56:33,571
learning how to hold the stupid instrument.

1118
00:56:33,605 --> 00:56:34,772
<i>You're joking.</i>

1119
00:56:34,806 --> 00:56:36,508
It's totally fucking lame.

1120
00:56:36,542 --> 00:56:37,843
Watch your language.

1121
00:56:37,877 --> 00:56:40,111
<i>And Mrs. Silver is
nationally renowned.</i>

1122
00:56:40,145 --> 00:56:41,379
As what?

1123
00:56:41,413 --> 00:56:43,381
As a violin teacher.

1124
00:56:43,415 --> 00:56:46,618
And your school happens to have the
top strings program in the country.

1125
00:56:46,652 --> 00:56:49,019
You know, families move to
Englewood just to go there.

1126
00:56:49,053 --> 00:56:51,088
Is that why we moved to Englewood?

1127
00:56:51,122 --> 00:56:55,760
No. I mean, I did check
out the school, but...

1128
00:56:55,794 --> 00:56:57,796
[sighs] Don't you like New Jersey?

1129
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:00,064
- I hate New Jersey.
- I love it.

1130
00:57:00,098 --> 00:57:02,033
You're a moron.

1131
00:57:02,067 --> 00:57:03,568
I wanted change.

1132
00:57:03,602 --> 00:57:07,004
So dad could be gone half the time
and you could get drunk every night?

1133
00:57:07,038 --> 00:57:08,506
Holy shit.

1134
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:11,142
- Angie, get out of the car.
- <i>Why?</i>

1135
00:57:11,176 --> 00:57:13,111
<i>Just get out of the car.</i>

1136
00:57:13,145 --> 00:57:15,413
Go to Strings.

1137
00:57:21,754 --> 00:57:23,789
Don't you ever talk to me like that again

1138
00:57:23,823 --> 00:57:26,425
especially in front of your little sister.

1139
00:57:26,459 --> 00:57:28,760
You might be a fucked up
little monster, but she isn't.

1140
00:57:28,794 --> 00:57:30,495
Well, like you say, mom

1141
00:57:30,529 --> 00:57:33,599
smart people, girls
especially, are all fucked up.

1142
00:57:35,667 --> 00:57:37,836
You think I'm drinking too much?

1143
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:41,807
<i>It's just wine mostly.</i>

1144
00:57:41,841 --> 00:57:43,642
I think you're not happy.

1145
00:57:43,676 --> 00:57:45,743
Not happy in the city working.

1146
00:57:45,777 --> 00:57:48,814
<i>Not happy in New Jersey not working.</i>

1147
00:57:48,848 --> 00:57:52,584
- I don't know what...
- Just don't drink anymore.

1148
00:57:52,618 --> 00:57:54,051
It's not that easy.

1149
00:57:54,085 --> 00:57:57,588
- <i>Try middle school.</i>
- Gladly.

1150
00:57:57,622 --> 00:57:58,923
Aren't there drugs you can take?

1151
00:57:58,957 --> 00:58:01,926
I'm on to about every one you can imagine.

1152
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,629
So are all the moms you can see.

1153
00:58:04,663 --> 00:58:08,633
Except maybe Marta, though she should be.

1154
00:58:08,667 --> 00:58:11,136
<i>Real mature, mom.</i>

1155
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:17,944
That will probably be the
highlight of my daylight hours.

1156
00:58:19,544 --> 00:58:21,680
- I'm sorry.
- No.

1157
00:58:21,714 --> 00:58:23,649
I am.

1158
00:58:25,651 --> 00:58:28,120
You should probably get going.

1159
00:58:40,198 --> 00:58:42,566
[car horn blaring]

1160
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,738
Jesus, fucking sharks.

1161
00:58:46,906 --> 00:58:49,041
[sighs]

1162
00:59:03,888 --> 00:59:05,890
- Gracie.
- <i>Good morning.</i>

1163
00:59:05,924 --> 00:59:07,725
I need you to give me a hand.

1164
00:59:07,759 --> 00:59:09,160
Empty all these.

1165
00:59:09,194 --> 00:59:12,664
The ones with screw tops,
you can pour down the sink.

1166
00:59:12,698 --> 00:59:14,164
The ones with corks, you can have.

1167
00:59:14,198 --> 00:59:15,700
No, I don't drink.

1168
00:59:15,734 --> 00:59:16,868
Oh, give 'em to your husband.

1169
00:59:16,902 --> 00:59:19,505
Trust me, he'll be happy.

1170
00:59:21,105 --> 00:59:23,174
Now.

1171
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:28,647
[bottles clinking]

1172
00:59:34,152 --> 00:59:35,954
<i>Are you sure about
these French ones?</i>

1173
00:59:35,988 --> 00:59:36,988
<i>He always say...</i>

1174
00:59:37,022 --> 00:59:39,759
If he cared, he'd be here.

1175
00:59:44,129 --> 00:59:47,132
[indistinct chatter]

1176
00:59:49,602 --> 00:59:50,568
Where the hell have you been?

1177
00:59:50,602 --> 00:59:51,602
I'm on time, aren't I?

1178
00:59:51,636 --> 00:59:53,037
For the meeting 2 hours ago?

1179
00:59:53,071 --> 00:59:55,839
- [chuckles]
- I'm sure you handled it fine.

1180
00:59:55,873 --> 00:59:57,609
I'm second fucking chair.

1181
00:59:57,643 --> 00:59:58,843
This is open and shut.

1182
00:59:58,877 --> 01:00:01,212
They should've settled.

1183
01:00:13,692 --> 01:00:16,026
All rise.

1184
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:18,497
[cell phone ringing]

1185
01:00:21,299 --> 01:00:24,202
Counselor, I really hope
you're not going to use

1186
01:00:24,236 --> 01:00:26,370
that in my courtroom.

1187
01:00:26,404 --> 01:00:28,138
Just turning it off, Your Honor.

1188
01:00:28,172 --> 01:00:29,473
<i>Hello, you've reached Jeffrey.</i>

1189
01:00:29,507 --> 01:00:32,776
<i>Please leave your name,
number and a detailed message</i>

1190
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:34,745
<i>and I'll get...</i>

1191
01:00:34,779 --> 01:00:36,714
Good morning, sunshine.

1192
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:38,816
Speaking of which

1193
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:40,852
where's that paperwork
I can sign myself out

1194
01:00:40,886 --> 01:00:42,754
to see some motherfucking sunshine?

1195
01:00:42,788 --> 01:00:45,022
What happened to a child like you?

1196
01:00:45,056 --> 01:00:46,658
Meaning?

1197
01:00:46,692 --> 01:00:47,959
Once you must was a good boy.

1198
01:00:47,993 --> 01:00:49,193
Done what him told.

1199
01:00:49,227 --> 01:00:52,830
How you gone so wrong?

1200
01:00:52,864 --> 01:00:55,033
I was 14...

1201
01:00:55,067 --> 01:00:57,901
...in the basement of my best
friend's house in Maryland

1202
01:00:57,935 --> 01:01:00,972
me and him snuck a bottle
of Sambuca down there

1203
01:01:01,006 --> 01:01:02,673
finished it between us.

1204
01:01:02,707 --> 01:01:04,209
I ain't never looked back.

1205
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:05,776
This ain't Sambuca.

1206
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:09,147
Discovered the good stuff a lot later.

1207
01:01:09,181 --> 01:01:11,450
And your friend?

1208
01:01:13,285 --> 01:01:16,921
Now he a fancy nigger lawyer
who don't answer my calls.

1209
01:01:16,955 --> 01:01:19,890
- <i>Maybe him busy with him life.</i>
- Oh, yeah?

1210
01:01:19,924 --> 01:01:22,727
You can't see you in charge of yourself

1211
01:01:22,761 --> 01:01:24,162
you can't do nothin'.

1212
01:01:24,196 --> 01:01:25,863
Do you think I don't know that?

1213
01:01:25,897 --> 01:01:29,300
<i>So why you here in a bed got straps?</i>

1214
01:01:34,772 --> 01:01:37,175
<i>But then, what do all these
thinkers we've examined this</i>

1215
01:01:37,209 --> 01:01:39,977
<i>semester have in common?</i>

1216
01:01:40,011 --> 01:01:45,015
If we truly explore to
find a common thread?

1217
01:01:45,049 --> 01:01:47,318
At the outset of a century
that would constitute

1218
01:01:47,352 --> 01:01:49,821
the bloodiest in human history.

1219
01:01:49,855 --> 01:01:54,024
Along with scientific and
technological advancements

1220
01:01:54,058 --> 01:01:57,461
that would literally make us like Gods.

1221
01:01:57,495 --> 01:02:01,899
Even as we began to dismantle
the very meaning of God.

1222
01:02:01,933 --> 01:02:04,303
They ask...

1223
01:02:05,937 --> 01:02:08,540
...what is a life?

1224
01:02:10,341 --> 01:02:14,479
Does to live any longer have a how?

1225
01:02:14,513 --> 01:02:19,216
Does it any longer have a why?

1226
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:21,219
[beeping]

1227
01:02:28,527 --> 01:02:31,763
<i>Against a backdrop
of industrialization</i>

1228
01:02:31,797 --> 01:02:36,401
<i>people will contend with

<i>population on a mass scale</i>

1230
01:02:39,238 --> 01:02:41,905
and murder on a mass scale.

1231
01:02:41,939 --> 01:02:45,843
They'll consider the constraints of truth.

1232
01:02:45,877 --> 01:02:47,979
Whether metaphor or paradigm

1233
01:02:48,013 --> 01:02:52,015
with many concluding actual
truth has never existed.

<i>A nexus in the great human saga...</i>

<i>of good and evil, right and wrong</i>

1237
01:03:02,326 --> 01:03:07,865
<i>as determined by a
creator for other opiates.</i>

<i>Communism, socialism,
capitalism, psychology</i>

1239

01:03:19,544 --> 01:03:23,881
The 20th century. My own.

1242
01:03:23,915 --> 01:03:28,352
But also the one into
which each of you was born.

1243
01:03:28,386 --> 01:03:33,457
<i>For many, an era of hope
liberation, possibility.</i>

1244
01:03:33,491 --> 01:03:38,296
<i>For others of
abandonment and despair.</i>

1245
01:03:38,330 --> 01:03:42,966
<i>A most human century
in which we begin</i>

01:04:04,355 --> 01:04:08,126
<i>In this void,
philosophy at its worst</i>

1253
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,861

1254
01:04:10,895 --> 01:04:14,932
<i>...linguistic, semantic</i>

1255
01:04:14,966 --> 01:04:18,269
<i>relativism having
rendered any discussion</i>

1256
01:04:18,303 --> 01:04:22,439
<i>of right and wrong, good and evil</i>

1257
01:04:22,473 --> 01:04:26,944
<i>to be the quaint
concerns of another age.</i>

1258
01:04:26,978 --> 01:04:31,916
<i>At its most provocative,
it asks other questions.</i>

1259
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:37,955
<i>Those concerned with locating
our stranded selves...</i>

1260
01:04:37,989 --> 01:04:41,426
...when meaning seems to have died.

1261
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,093
He's expecting your call.

1262
01:04:43,127 --> 01:04:45,129
So you gonna sign me out or what?

1263
01:04:45,163 --> 01:04:48,533
<i>Nothing less, in short,
then why do we live at all?</i>

1264
01:04:48,567 --> 01:04:49,533
Call him. Go there.

1265
01:04:49,567 --> 01:04:53,872
<i>And what makes us who we are?</i>

1266
01:04:53,906 --> 01:04:57,441
They ask what now?

1267
01:04:57,475 --> 01:05:00,510
And we're still asking it.

1268
01:05:00,544 --> 01:05:04,015
What will fortify us as another century

1269
01:05:04,049 --> 01:05:07,184
your century commences?

1270
01:05:07,218 --> 01:05:11,923
Do we abandon finally the search for truths

1271
01:05:11,957 --> 01:05:15,526
that seem ever more
elusive, even silly to some?

1272
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,396
The ethical? The moral? The good?

<i>Principles that by definition
can never be proved</i>

1274
01:05:23,201 --> 01:05:26,303
<i>when so much now can be proved?</i>

1275
01:05:26,337 --> 01:05:31,042
<i>Or is all this finally
and forever pointless?</i>

1276
01:05:31,076 --> 01:05:33,912
<i>Are we done?</i>

1277
01:05:33,946 --> 01:05:38,316

the planet irreversibly</i>

01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:51,930
<i>even while intoxicating
ourselves with it all.</i>

1282
01:05:51,964 --> 01:05:56,234
And yet, how do we still seek purpose?

1283
01:05:56,268 --> 01:06:00,939
And where do we hope to
find it if we're so busy

1284
01:06:00,973 --> 01:06:05,075
convincing ourselves there needn't be any?

1285
01:06:05,109 --> 01:06:08,046
<i>And so we wander...</i>

1286
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:11,515
<i>...eyes closed to the dark</i>

<i>With less to guide us now than ever.</i>

1296
01:06:40,178 --> 01:06:43,147
And I certainly haven't
taught these writers

1297
01:06:43,181 --> 01:06:46,450
for 30 years just so
you can drop references

1298

1299
01:06:49,087 --> 01:06:50,455

[all chuckling]

1301
01:06:54,426 --> 01:06:57,462
The crowd is untruth.

1302
01:06:59,064 --> 01:07:02,033
In an era darkened by the false

1303
01:07:02,067 --> 01:07:04,602
shade of imperviousness

1304
01:07:04,636 --> 01:07:09,707

Either to one another or more importantly

1310
01:07:28,393 --> 01:07:31,763
to everything we've
learned from one another.

1311
01:07:35,067 --> 01:07:38,971
<i>May your best years be yet to come.</i>

1312
01:07:41,705 --> 01:07:44,776
And so for us all.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Hey, what are you doing?

1317
01:08:21,612 --> 01:08:24,248
That's my purse!

<i>Motherfucker!</i>

1320
01:08:55,913 --> 01:08:57,748
So I heard you gave quite the final lecture

1321
01:08:57,782 --> 01:08:59,684
in the survey course.

1322
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:03,386
Well attended anyway. Students
I hadn't seen in years.

[chuckles]

1324
01:09:04,855 --> 01:09:06,724
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

1325
01:09:08,193 --> 01:09:11,195
This is me, so...

1326
01:09:11,229 --> 01:09:14,531
You made a promise.

1327
01:09:14,565 --> 01:09:16,633
- I know.
- So?

1328
01:09:16,667 --> 01:09:18,535
I... I... I can't.

1329
01:09:18,569 --> 01:09:22,606
I'll make me a willow cabin at your gate.

1330
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,307
Who's that?

1331
01:09:24,341 --> 01:09:26,409
Viola from "Twelfth Night."

1332
01:09:26,443 --> 01:09:31,214
I said it to my wife 46
years ago when I proposed.

1333
01:09:31,248 --> 01:09:33,618
You're gonna be late
getting back to her, so...

1334
01:09:33,652 --> 01:09:36,220
And later still the longer we tarry.

1335
01:09:36,254 --> 01:09:38,256
I can just get another one.

1336
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:41,792
- I can use cigarettes.
- A moment at a time.

1337
01:09:55,706 --> 01:09:57,275
Hmm...

01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:25,770
I was with a student.

If you can.

1347

You're late tonight, sir.

In all the years of coming here

1353
01:11:05,343 --> 01:11:07,378
I've never told you my name.

1354
01:11:07,412 --> 01:11:08,745
It's Walter.

1355
01:11:08,779 --> 01:11:12,249
It would make me so happy
if you called me that.

- Walter.
- Ignacio.

- Good evening.
- <i>Hey.</i>

fades I'm happy to report.

A couple of bunches of hydrangeas?

You got it.

Drink milk all my life.

1365
01:11:43,348 --> 01:11:45,382
Maybe you drunk milk too.

1366
01:11:45,416 --> 01:11:47,618
Look like you've lived a good life.

1367
01:11:47,652 --> 01:11:49,352
I have actually.

1368
01:11:49,386 --> 01:11:50,988
What's the secret?

1369
01:11:52,323 --> 01:11:54,324
You can't imagine how ironic it is

1370
01:11:54,358 --> 01:11:56,894
that you're asking me that today.

1371
01:11:56,928 --> 01:11:59,930
Perhaps it's as simple as
enjoying a glass of milk

1372
01:11:59,964 --> 01:12:02,967
or buying flowers for
your wife every Friday

1373
01:12:03,001 --> 01:12:04,869
which I've done for as
long as I can remember

1374
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:06,003
and which I shall do now.

1375
01:12:06,037 --> 01:12:09,440
Could you loan me 5 bucks?

1376
01:12:09,474 --> 01:12:11,909
For?

1377
01:12:11,943 --> 01:12:15,945
Gonna buy drugs, which I need... awful bad.

1378
01:12:15,979 --> 01:12:18,349
Hungry too.

1379
01:12:19,917 --> 01:12:22,720
I'm gonna give this to
the man at the register

1380
01:12:22,754 --> 01:12:24,821
and tell him you can
have anything in the store

1381
01:12:24,855 --> 01:12:26,723
one can eat up to $5 worth

1382
01:12:26,757 --> 01:12:28,793
and that he is to keep the change.

1383
01:12:28,827 --> 01:12:32,096
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

1384
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:33,596
And if you ever see me around here

1385
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:35,365
I'll always do the same for you.

1386
01:12:35,399 --> 01:12:38,336

Yo, mister, let me get 50 cents, man.

1398
01:13:15,639 --> 01:13:18,641
I'll get you a cup of coffee.

1399
01:13:18,675 --> 01:13:21,378
- I want 50 cent.
- Sorry.

1400
01:13:21,412 --> 01:13:24,147
Maybe you should let these
young ladies get to their dog.

1401
01:13:24,181 --> 01:13:25,348
You gonna tell me what
to do in my neighborhood?

1402

but no, it's just a request.

Excuse me. He bought that for you?

That he did.
