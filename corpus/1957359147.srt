182
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:35,303
It's deeper than that.

183
00:06:35,337 --> 00:06:36,371
Is this a faith crisis?

184
00:06:36,405 --> 00:06:38,373
No, not at all.

185
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:40,076
Remember back when
first started?

186
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:42,545
Yeah, those were good times.

187
00:06:42,578 --> 00:06:45,782
We had 60 people at the most,

188
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:48,751
and all we did was
preach the gospel.

189
00:06:48,785 --> 00:06:50,620
Ooh, Superman works.

190
00:06:50,653 --> 00:06:52,455
I like Superman.

191
00:06:52,488 --> 00:06:53,422
Are you listening to me?

192
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:54,757
Yes, of course!

193
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,559
"A good pastor
has to multitask."

194
00:06:56,592 --> 00:06:57,660
It was in my book.

195
00:06:57,693 --> 00:06:58,594
Go on.

196
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:00,797
I can't function like this.

197
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,499
Evangelicalism has
become this machine

198
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:05,367
and it's eating me up.

199
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:07,637
Take a nap.

200
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,005
"A good nap always
refreshes me."

201
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:10,473
That was also in my book.

202
00:07:10,506 --> 00:07:13,075
Did you even read my book?

203
00:07:13,109 --> 00:07:14,510
Wow!

204
00:07:14,544 --> 00:07:15,812
Those are both good.

205
00:07:15,845 --> 00:07:17,947
Guy, what do you think?

206
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,115
I'm done.

207
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:20,883
He's right, no masks.

208
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:22,418
So let's stick with Superman.

209
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:23,820
Thanks.

210
00:07:23,853 --> 00:07:26,122
You're the most popular
youth pastor in the country.

211
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:27,690
Everybody loves you.

212
00:07:27,723 --> 00:07:29,625
They'll find someone else.

213
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:32,595
America's youth
pastor can't quit.

214
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:36,499
America would be bummed.

215
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:40,503
Your kids would
be really bummed.

216
00:07:41,737 --> 00:07:43,439
Guy, listen to me.

217
00:07:45,608 --> 00:07:47,743
I know you're under
a lot of pressure.

218
00:07:47,777 --> 00:07:49,478
I get it.

219
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:51,380
I'm feelin' it too.

220
00:07:51,414 --> 00:07:55,418
I need something big for
Good Friday and Easter.

221
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,788
Bigger than the resurrection?

222
00:07:59,722 --> 00:08:02,124
Maybe I've hit my ceiling?

223
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:03,159
I rode in on a Harley.

224
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:04,493
I rode in on a cow.

225
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:06,529
I got shot out of a cannon.

226
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:08,397
What if you dial
it back for a year?

227
00:08:08,431 --> 00:08:10,766
No, no, more is more, Guy!

228
00:08:12,168 --> 00:08:13,970
More show, more
people in the seats.

229
00:08:14,003 --> 00:08:15,404
More people in the seats,

230
00:08:15,438 --> 00:08:17,540
more people get to
hear the gospel!

231
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:20,176
I'm not sure
your math adds up.

232
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,477
What is it?

233
00:08:22,845 --> 00:08:24,380
What's the hook?

234
00:08:26,515 --> 00:08:29,852
I would love to
help you, but I quit.

235
00:08:29,886 --> 00:08:31,454
No, you are not quitting.

I am.

00:08:33,489 --> 00:08:36,459
Fine, quit after
you take a nap.

The relationship was over.

1256
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,383
About a month later,
your mom came to me

1257
00:45:06,416 --> 00:45:08,050
and told me she was pregnant,

1258
00:45:08,084 --> 00:45:10,352
and she thought we should
give the baby up for adoption,

1259
00:45:10,387 --> 00:45:13,089
and I agreed it would be best.

1260
00:45:15,658 --> 00:45:16,759
The baby?

1261
00:45:17,427 --> 00:45:18,395
That would be me?

1262
00:45:18,428 --> 00:45:21,130
Yeah, you were the baby.

1263
00:45:21,163 --> 00:45:23,732
We gave you up for adoption.

1264
00:45:23,766 --> 00:45:26,969
Well, except she didn't
give me up for adoption.

1265
00:45:27,002 --> 00:45:28,137
What?

1266
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,839
She kept the baby.

[Gretchen] Did I
tell you my name?

1272
00:45:47,156 --> 00:45:48,757
He does That.

1273
00:45:48,791 --> 00:45:49,758

Chad, we're on our way out,

1277
00:45:53,129 --> 00:45:53,929

- Just take a second.

1278
00:45:53,963 --> 00:45:55,364
Over here, this...

1279
00:45:55,398 --> 00:45:56,665
Beautiful.

1280
00:45:56,699 --> 00:45:58,234
And back it up a little bit.

1281
00:45:58,267 --> 00:45:59,068
A little bit.

Perfect.

00:46:01,438 --> 00:46:02,771
Great.

1285

- One, two, three.
- Chad, what are you-

1286
00:46:06,742 --> 00:46:08,744
- One more step, Pastor Guy.

I'm so sorry.

Are you okay?

1291
00:46:15,751 --> 00:46:16,453
I'm fine.

1292

Are you all right, Blaise?

1293

I'm great!

1294

This is the best day of my life.

Well, to be fair,
that's every day for you.

1296

Yeah, but this is a big one.

1297

It's like the most
exciting day ever!

1298

I'm gonna be crucified.

1299
00:46:28,498 --> 00:46:29,932

Did he just say, he's
gonna be crucified?

Hey, I gotta go kill someone,

1304
00:46:43,513 --> 00:46:45,981
but do you wanna spend the
rest of the afternoon together?

1305
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,815
- Sure.
- All right.

00:46:55,525 --> 00:46:57,394
Funny, I just read
somewhere recently

1310
00:46:57,427 --> 00:46:59,929
that sarcasm could be genetic.

1311
00:47:01,498 --> 00:47:04,733
I'm not gonna let you do this.

1312
00:47:04,767 --> 00:47:05,801
Okay.

1313

Preach on the death and
resurrection of Jesus.

1317

Hmm, riveting.

1318
00:47:14,009 --> 00:47:16,779
We're competing against a
lot of noise out there, Guy.

1319
00:47:16,812 --> 00:47:19,782
It's all chats, and tweets,
and bleeps, and blurps.

1320
00:47:19,815 --> 00:47:20,749
Blurps?

1321
00:47:20,783 --> 00:47:24,286
We've gotta grab their
attention and hold it!

1322
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:29,325
Maybe we could get some noisy
gongs and clanging symbols?

1323
00:47:29,792 --> 00:47:30,393
Fun.

1324
00:47:31,093 --> 00:47:32,861
I know you're offended by this,

1325
00:47:32,895 --> 00:47:34,863
but God made me an entrepreneur,

1326
00:47:34,897 --> 00:47:37,299
and I could have used that
gift to build a corporation,

1327
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:39,402
but I've chosen to
build His kingdom.

1328

Skip, I am not
questioning your motives.

1329
00:47:44,807 --> 00:47:47,343
I'm concerned
about your methods.

We've been through the
trenches together for years.

called to different work?

you have to do,

have to do to stop this.

was cool even when it was.

making a big comeback.

00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:19,021
I'm not ready for that.

1432
00:51:19,054 --> 00:51:19,955
I'm really mad at her.

1433
00:51:19,988 --> 00:51:24,126
I know, that's why
there's a Phase Four.

1434
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:25,395
- [trunk slams shut]
- Hey.

1435
00:51:25,428 --> 00:51:28,465
Guy Sides, I pray he
finds his repentance,

1436
00:51:28,498 --> 00:51:30,299
and finds forgiveness.

1437
00:51:33,202 --> 00:51:35,204
Why are we meeting
in the Prayer Room?

1438
00:51:35,237 --> 00:51:37,774
We both have really
cool offices.

1439
00:51:37,807 --> 00:51:38,842
I know, I Just
thought I'd have this

1440
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:42,211
difficult conversation
in an attitude of prayer.

1441
00:51:42,244 --> 00:51:43,513
Right.

1442
00:51:43,546 --> 00:51:45,147
- Good call.
- Yeah.

1443
00:51:47,417 --> 00:51:49,452
You know Guy has a daughter?

1444
00:51:49,486 --> 00:51:50,720
I know.

1445
00:51:50,753 --> 00:51:52,354
I've been praying
for her for years.

1446
00:51:52,388 --> 00:51:53,756
Well, she just showed up.

1447
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:56,225
- Mabel, here?
- Yeah.

1448
00:51:56,258 --> 00:51:57,059
No way!

1449
00:51:57,092 --> 00:51:58,360
That's awesome.

1450
00:51:59,529 --> 00:52:00,797
But he's isn't
married, you know?

1451
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:03,065
I had my suspicions.

1452
00:52:03,733 --> 00:52:06,134
Well, you and I, you know,

1453
00:52:06,168 --> 00:52:07,670
we gotta lot of
grace for people.

1454
00:52:07,704 --> 00:52:12,408
Just not so sure everybody's
gonna be as understanding.

1455
00:52:12,442 --> 00:52:17,279
And it's probably going to be
upsetting to certain people.

1456
00:52:20,148 --> 00:52:22,050
Thanks, Tino.

1457
00:52:22,084 --> 00:52:23,151
Let's keep this between us,

1458
00:52:23,185 --> 00:52:25,455
but you've been a big help.

1459
00:52:26,623 --> 00:52:28,123
[Tino] Thank you.

1460
00:52:28,156 --> 00:52:28,825
I know.

1461
00:52:28,858 --> 00:52:30,125
Shh, shh.

1462
00:52:33,195 --> 00:52:35,163
[Pastor Skip] Thank you.

[uptempo pop music continues]

1466
00:52:42,204 --> 00:52:45,508
I think it is so cool that
you're talking to my parents.

1467
00:52:45,542 --> 00:52:46,643
[Carla] Blaise, that's great.

1468
00:52:46,676 --> 00:52:48,210
I was nervous you'd be upset.

1469
00:52:48,243 --> 00:52:50,813
Nah, the Cameron
family doesn't get upset.

1470
00:52:50,847 --> 00:52:52,849
That may change today

1471
00:52:52,882 --> 00:52:55,250
once I tell 'em what's going on.

1472
00:52:55,284 --> 00:52:57,587
They're gonna be
really upset, Blaise.

1473
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:59,121
Wow.

1474
00:52:59,154 --> 00:53:00,590
My parents upset.

1475
00:53:04,326 --> 00:53:05,160
Awesome.

1476
00:53:07,497 --> 00:53:09,097
Wait, I live here.

[footsteps pattering]

1479
00:53:15,237 --> 00:53:16,138
[Mrs. Cameron] Try this.

1480
00:53:16,171 --> 00:53:18,240
It stimulates brain waves.
[tray clanks]

1481
00:53:18,273 --> 00:53:19,274
Thank you.

1482
00:53:23,546 --> 00:53:25,815
I already feel it working.

1483
00:53:25,848 --> 00:53:27,884
Anyway, those
are just 10 reasons

1484
00:53:27,917 --> 00:53:30,386
why Blaise shouldn't
be crucified.

1485
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:34,156
You make a compelling
case, I must say.

1486
00:53:34,189 --> 00:53:35,290
And I wanna affirm you in that,

1487
00:53:35,324 --> 00:53:36,893
the same way we affirm Blaise

1488
00:53:36,926 --> 00:53:39,662
in whatever makes him happy.

1489
00:53:39,696 --> 00:53:42,297
I just wish there was
something we could do.

1490
00:53:42,331 --> 00:53:46,201
[dramatic orchestral music]

1491
00:53:51,507 --> 00:53:53,476
You're his parents?

1492
00:53:53,509 --> 00:53:55,545
That's right.

1493
00:53:55,578 --> 00:53:58,514
So you could tell him no.

1494
00:53:58,548 --> 00:54:01,216
[both laughing]

1495
00:54:02,552 --> 00:54:05,354
Obviously, you
don't have children.

1496
00:54:05,388 --> 00:54:06,456
Not yet.

1497
00:54:06,489 --> 00:54:07,924
No.

1498
00:54:07,957 --> 00:54:11,226
We foster a "yes"
environment here,

1499
00:54:12,395 --> 00:54:15,565
a positive posture
toward the universe.

1500
00:54:15,598 --> 00:54:16,399
I'm hungry.

1501
00:54:16,432 --> 00:54:18,233
Anybody want toast?

1502
00:54:18,868 --> 00:54:19,702
Sure.

1503
00:54:21,871 --> 00:54:23,706
Isn't he a delight?

1504
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:26,375
We didn't teach him that.

1505
00:54:26,409 --> 00:54:29,144
Offering toast
comes from within.

1506
00:54:31,981 --> 00:54:33,449
Interesting.

1507
00:54:33,483 --> 00:54:34,316
Yeah.

1508
00:54:35,518 --> 00:54:37,787
Can we get back to
the conversation?

1509
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:40,857
Blaise is going to be crucified.

1510
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:43,459
You make it sound so negative.

1511
00:54:43,493 --> 00:54:44,727
Mr. and Mrs. Cameron,

1512
00:54:44,761 --> 00:54:47,229
crucifixion is not
a positive thing.

1513
00:54:47,262 --> 00:54:49,231
- It's a horrible-
- Nah, nu-uh-uh.

1514
00:54:49,264 --> 00:54:50,600
Not necessarily.

1515
00:54:51,534 --> 00:54:53,201
Doesn't your religion contend,

1516
00:54:53,235 --> 00:54:56,906
that Jesus paid for your
sins through crucifixion?

1517
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:00,810
- Yeah, but-
- So it is positive.

1518
00:55:01,778 --> 00:55:04,212
- Mm-hmm.
- I've changed my mind!

1519
00:55:04,246 --> 00:55:06,281
I'm having grilled cheese.

1520
00:55:06,314 --> 00:55:09,284
You always make
great choices, sweetie.

[toaster clatters]

1522
00:55:10,987 --> 00:55:13,756
So wait, let me make sure
I'm hearing this correctly.

1523
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:15,992
You're gonna allow
him to do this?

1524
00:55:16,025 --> 00:55:19,227
Well, you're still
not getting it, dear.

1525
00:55:19,261 --> 00:55:21,898
We don't allow him
to do anything.

1526
00:55:23,365 --> 00:55:24,867
We don't own him.

1527
00:55:24,901 --> 00:55:28,236
But you're
responsible for him.

1528
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:29,872
You could parent him.

1529
00:55:29,906 --> 00:55:31,708
Well, that's a
very novel concept,

1530
00:55:31,741 --> 00:55:35,478
but that's just not
how we see ourselves.

1531
00:55:35,511 --> 00:55:37,245
We're just all here together,

1532
00:55:37,279 --> 00:55:40,016
you know, like
good, older friends.

1533
00:55:40,049 --> 00:55:41,417
Right, Blaise?

1534
00:55:41,451 --> 00:55:42,719
Right, Alice.

00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:53,261
It's your job to teach
Blaise how to live.

1538
00:55:53,295 --> 00:55:57,533
Maybe you could start by
preventing him from dying.

How are you not
freaking out right now?

I'm just impressed.

1551
00:56:27,864 --> 00:56:29,565
With you.

1552
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:30,767
[Guy] What are
you talking about?

1553
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,334
Blaise's parents didn't
hear a word I said.

1554
00:56:32,367 --> 00:56:34,336
[laughs] I know.

1555
00:56:34,369 --> 00:56:36,939
They were not there, but I was.

Well, I am lost.

No, no.

I think I look all right?

1564
00:56:56,425 --> 00:56:57,894
That's what I would have done.

angel, how are you?

00:57:03,432 --> 00:57:06,068
Carla just got home from
serving the Lord overseas,

1569
00:57:06,102 --> 00:57:08,104
and she is never leaving again.

No, don't be silly.

Look, I know what
this is all about.

1578
00:57:22,018 --> 00:57:24,387
You found out about
Guy's illegitimate child

1579
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:25,621
and you are devastated.

1580
00:57:25,655 --> 00:57:27,490
Correction, no,
she's wonderful,

1581
00:57:27,523 --> 00:57:28,791
and Guy's really stepping up.

- Honey, that's why

Dad, listen, you have to
cancel this Good Friday stunt.

1586
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:39,035
You're making the cross of
Jesus into a freak show.

1587
00:57:39,068 --> 00:57:41,103
Honey, if following
Jesus makes me a freak,

1588
00:57:41,137 --> 00:57:43,906
then I'm about to
get super freaky.

1589
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:46,042
How very '80s of you.

1590
00:57:46,075 --> 00:57:47,877
Look, the way I see it,

1591
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:51,647
we can talk about the crucifixion
for a few thousand people,

1592
00:57:51,681 --> 00:57:53,916
or we can show the crucifixion

1593
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:56,452
for tens of millions of people.

1594
00:57:56,485 --> 00:57:58,788
[scoffs] Don't you want
them to understand the Gospel?

1595
00:57:58,821 --> 00:57:59,655
Honey, it's in there.

1596
00:57:59,689 --> 00:58:00,590
Trust me.

1597
00:58:00,623 --> 00:58:02,024
You bring 'em in with the show,

1598
00:58:02,058 --> 00:58:04,894
and you give 'em a little
nibble of the truth.

1599
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:07,163
You have completely
lost your way.

1600
00:58:07,196 --> 00:58:08,130
Don't be so dramatic, honey.

1601
00:58:08,164 --> 00:58:10,633
That can push people away.

1602
00:58:10,666 --> 00:58:11,968
Ooh,

1605
00:58:15,037 --> 00:58:17,640
That's what I would've done.

something different here?

I hope so.

2159
01:20:50,192 --> 01:20:54,797
The last words Jesus
spoke on the cross were,

2160
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:56,232
"It is finished".

2161
01:21:00,035 --> 01:21:02,371
And by "finished",
he meant done,

2163

to have a crucifixion today.

for creative ways

2170
01:21:27,597 --> 01:21:29,865

2171
01:21:30,866 --> 01:21:33,202
And then our Youth
Program blew up,

2172
01:21:33,235 --> 01:21:38,240
and people around the country
started asking me what I did.

2173
01:21:39,108 --> 01:21:40,876

2174

And then one day, I woke
up the "Beach Ball Guy".

2181

"Beach Ball Guy" overnight.
