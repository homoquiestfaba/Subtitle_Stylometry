1
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,097
Oh, jackpot.

2
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,817
-

3
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,367
Get the hell away from my cans!

4
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,578
-Them cans is mine.

5
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,294
Now, I done told you,
them cans is mine!

6
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:15,427
-

7
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,827
-

8
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:47,126
SHAWNA:
Summer. This one started out

9
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,462
just like the last one
and the one before that.

10
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:52,089
Taking the bus to the Quarter,

11
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,175
sneaking up onto some
bougie hotel rooftop

12
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,387
and watching my best friend
Pedro get a tan.

13
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,139
Um, when did you get all that?

14
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,932
Get all what?

15
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,272
Okay, what you need to do
is flaunt them shits.

16
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,190
They’re way cuter than
those little mosquito bites

17
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:11,901
you was working with
last summer.

18
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:13,360
You’re not even
supposed to like boobs.

19
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:15,362
I never said I liked them, mami.

20
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:20,367
Why don’t you get
some of this sun?

21
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:22,453
I’m not trying to get no darker.

22
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,803
SHAWNA: We didn’t know it yet,
but this summer...

23
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,847
this summer was about to be

24
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:44,767
very, very different.

25
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,518
"Different" ain’t even the word.

26
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:48,687
I guess what I’m trying to say
is this summer,

27
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:52,483
the summer my whole world got,
like, messed-up beyond belief,

28
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,693
the summer I got breasts,

29
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:58,906
that was the same summer
I fought vampires.

30
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:20,904
PEDRO: Ooh, I’m so excited
about tonight.

31
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,489
What you got going till then?

32
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,491
SHAWNA: Got to go see my mom.
Trying to roll?

33
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,702
To Ombreux? Mm, no, thanks.

34
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,370
It’s not that bad.

35
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,582
But it really is, though.

36
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,375
You excited about tonight?

37
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:36,003
Beaucoup cute boys.

38
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,130
Trades, you feel me?

39
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,508
Platinum Percy’s spinning.
You love to dance.

40
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,886
Not in front of other people.

41
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,929
That why you didn’t try out
for the dance team?

42
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,639
No, I didn’t try out
for the dance team

43
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:50,059
’cause 90% of the girls
they pick are Creole.

44
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,560
There’s a certain look.

45
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,312
Okay, that just means
ten percent ain’t Creole,

46
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,980
-so that’s all you.
-

47
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:57,441
Since when did you become
a life coach all of a sudden?

48
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,443
Don’t you have your own stuff
to figure out?

49
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:00,819
Like?

50
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:03,655
Like a full scholarship
to a great boarding school

51
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,407
with a nationally ranked
track team.

52
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,494
Yeah, but it’s in Texas, though.

53
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,953
So?

54
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,789
So, if I leave New Orleans,

55
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,499
is it really even
New Orleans anymore?

56
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,626
Like, can this bitch survive
without me?

57
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,211
Oh, my God.

58
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,962
And who’s gonna be here
to educate your ign’ant ass

59
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,798
about our city’s
magnificent history and culture?

60
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,008
Who’s gonna remind you
that we did not host

61
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:24,384
the country’s first Mardi Gras

62
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,136
but we did put on
the first opera?

63
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,513
And who’s gonna explain to you

64
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,098
why po’boys got to be
on stale bread?

65
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,475
Okay, I get it, Professor.
You staying.

66
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,228
Plus, my family, you know.

67
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,690
So, this party tonight?

68
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,237
I don’t have anything to wear.

69
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,489
Hell nah. No, you are not
backing out on me.

70
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,741
We show up together,
we leave together, and we dance

71
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:50,119
with as many cute boys
as we can in between.

72
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,829
What time we meeting?

73
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,665
Depends on when my dad
gets off of work.

74
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,543
What time, Shawna?

75
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,045
Like... 7:00-ish, maybe.

76
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:01,255
All right, bitch. 7:00.

77
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,842
Don’t be late.

78
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,177
See you.

79
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,141
-

80
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:14,560
Yo. What’s going on, partner?

81
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:17,062
my site to show me love...

82
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,273
Save the Ombreux!

83
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,275
Save the Ombreux! That’s right!

84
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,443
OLD MAN: You’re never too young
to start fighting

85
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:24,778
for what you deserve.

86
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,238
If not now, then when?

87
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,157
If not us, then who?

88
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,908
ACTIVIST:
Save the Ombreux!

89
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:31,827
SHAWNA: If you would’ve
asked me back then,

90
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,079
I would’ve told you
these people are crazy.

91
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:36,206
Like, don’t they have
anything better to do?

92
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,917
I mean, the Ombreux
was hardly worth saving.

93
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,547
Besides the fact that
it was falling apart,

94
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,049
this shit had basically become
a one-stop shop

95
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,509
for sellers and users.

96
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,720
If you weren’t
slangin’ or coppin’,

97
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,097
you didn’t have
any business there.

98
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,809
I was probably
the only normal person

99
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,978
who ever came out this way.

100
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,443
Or maybe not.

101
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,362
-Mm, that’s Chris Thompson.

102
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:10,741
Junior, popular, cool, fun,

103
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,202
and the absolute last person
I expected to see

104
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,245
walking into the Ombreux.

105
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,665
-

106
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,059
-

107
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,814
Come on. Come on.

108
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:44,191
H-Hey, Mommy.

109
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,529
I, uh...
I brought you some stuff.

110
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:51,823
Any money?

111
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,284
I’m not supposed to be
bringing you...

112
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:58,247
I just need to buy some Tampax.

113
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,458
What, I need permission from
your father to do that, too?

114
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,798
I know I put a dollar
in here somewhere.

115
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:17,224
Um...

116
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,018
I’ll just leave these here,
I guess.

117
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:22,271
Shawna, wait.

118
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,993
I’m sorry I hollered at you.

119
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,869
It’s just...

120
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:41,540
things your father put
in your head about me, they...

121
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,668
I’m better.

122
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,920
I-I’ve been better
for months now.

123
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,591
Well, then...

124
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,220
...maybe you could just
come home, then.

125
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:56,972
Oh, uh-uh.

126
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,682
Ain’t that easy, baby girl.

127
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,148
You been watching my plants
while I’ve been away?

128
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,941
Jamal has.

129
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,070
And they ain’t died yet?

130
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:14,281
Mm-mm.

131
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:17,534
He do know that zebra plant
need light all day?

132
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,703
It’s tropical.

133
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,629
-I miss you.
-

134
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,382
We all do.

135
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,137
I miss y’all, too.

136
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,642
Hey, uh...

137
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,319
Yeah.

138
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,321
I look at these pictures
every night

139
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,324
and pray to Jesus
I can come home.

140
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,372
My friends say,
"Girl, sell that thing.

141
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,791
You know how much money
you could get?"

142
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:09,628
But I ain’t never
gonna sell this.

143
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:22,057
Um...

144
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:26,603
You got any money for Mama?

145
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,022
Even just a dollar?

146
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:29,416
-

147
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,299
gold bottles, gold letters

148
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,301
Late Night with Letterman

149
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:42,053
the winning was better, man

150
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,642
STEVEN:
And dinner is served.

151
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:51,354
Hey, Jamal, go ahead and turn
off that music if you could.

152
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,234
JAMAL:
Dad, what is that?

153
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:57,777
That is a casserole.

154
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,113
Are you sure?

155
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,365
Sit. Eat.

156
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,659
-JAMAL: All right.
-

157
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,168
Dad, do you think maybe
Mom could come home soon?

158
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,670
I mean, maybe she’s better.

159
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:18,215
Or maybe she could be better
if she was here.

160
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,009
Your mom’s got some stuff she
needs to figure out on her own.

161
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,595
-If she cared, maybe she’d try
a little harder. -Hey.

162
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,138
She cares, all right?

163
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:28,016
It’s just, she’s been through
a lot since the storm.

164
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,018
The storm? That’s her excuse?

165
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,062
Dad, that was like 15 years ago.

166
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,272
Yeah, well, she’s still hurting.

167
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:36,858
Lot of folks are.
Show some respect.

168
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:41,071
I saw Chris today, J.

169
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,073
-STEVEN: Who’s Chris?
-Just a boy.

170
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,909
-A boy?
-SHAWNA: No...

171
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,827
JAMAL:
A boy who ain’t feeling her.

172
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:48,912
How you know?

173
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,497
’Cause Chris got
mad light-skinned

174
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,706
Creole girls with wavy hair.

175
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,583
-And?
-Look how dark you is.

176
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,169
You look like
Wesley Snipes with braids.

177
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:58,964
Jamal. You gonna give
the girl a complex.

178
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,424
JAMAL:
My bad. Sorry.

179
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,759
STEVEN:
Yeah, you’ll be sorry all right.

180
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,177
You understand?

181
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:05,637
You’re gonna be sorry.

182
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,931
And you too young
to be worrying about boys.

183
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,015
Eat.

184
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,184
Both of you.

185
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:16,189
-"Creole girls." Ridiculous.
-

186
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:17,732
Wesley Snipes.

187
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,526
don’t give me that, no

188
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,319
-

189
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:22,654
-

190
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,031
some more...

191
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,034
Excuse me.

192
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:30,287
when you wiggle low

193
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,372
wiggle low

194
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,040
wiggle low...

195
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,501
-What are you doing?
-I’m trying to help you out.

196
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:38,962
You look crazy, girl--
like, legit homeless.

197
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,214
You know, next time,
you getting ready at my house

198
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,466
so I can approve beforehand,
’cause just...

199
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,012
-Ew, no, no.
-Okay, okay, I get it.

200
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,390
SHAWNA:
It was him again.

201
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:51,766
Chris.

202
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,852
Those eyes, those lips.

203
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,104
Ooh, those muscles!

204
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,648
Even his hair was perfect.

205
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:01,234
Oh, my God. I admit it, yeah.

206
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:04,070
I was thirsty.

207
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,242
You got exactly 30 seconds to
go over there and holla at him,

208
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,953
or I’m not gonna talk to you
for the rest of the summer.

209
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,580
What are you even talking about?

210
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,916
Bitch, don’t even try me,
’cause you know I ain’t playing.

211
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,376
Pedro.

212
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,545
29, 28,

213
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:24,174
27, 26...

214
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:28,345
-Hey, what about...
-25, 24,

215
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,972
23, 22...

216
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:32,432
-CHRIS: I’m telling y’all.

217
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,017
-Hey, Chris.
-We do this every weekend.

218
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,477
Saints game, I promise y’all.
And then New Year’s.

219
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,562
Like, y’all don’t,
y’all don’t really understand...

220
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:38,897
Hey, Chris!

221
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,108
Hey.

222
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:44,694
Uh, hey. Do I know you?

223
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,238
Uh, yeah.

224
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:48,740
Yeah, we met before.

225
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,409
I’m-I’m Shawna,
Jamal’s little sister.

226
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:54,162
-Oh. Right.
-

227
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,542
You’re on the dance team, right?

228
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:00,710
-Mm-hmm.
-

229
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,004
Like, that’s really cool.

230
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,007
SHAWNA:
Um...

231
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:09,469
I think I saw you today
over at the-the Ombreux.

232
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:10,887
No.

233
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,389
Ombreux? Nah.

234
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,557
Nah.
-Yeah, it was definitely you.

235
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,185
Um, maybe, like,
around 4:00, maybe...

236
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:20,605
I said nah,
that-that wasn’t me, man.

237
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,195
Okay.

238
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,406
Yeah, I just wanted to, um...

239
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,990
I just wanted to come over here

240
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,784
and just tell you
that I liked your shape.

241
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:38,373
I liked your shirt.
I liked your shirt.

242
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,254
Um...

243
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,256
yeah, I just...
I just wanted to come over here

244
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,967
and tell you that, so I’ll,
uh... I’ll see you around.

245
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,219
All right, Samantha.

246
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,096
Be easy.

247
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,725
PEDRO: Oh, you won’t
have to take me there.

248
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,310
SHAWNA:
 I was so stupid.

249
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,563
I should’ve just stayed home.

250
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,356
Two big lessons from that night:

251
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,818
think before
you shoot your shot,

252
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:10,029
and never walk home alone.

253
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:11,948
Pedro.

254
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,658
Sorry to dip on you like that.

255
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,702
I just wasn’t feeling
that party.

256
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,454
I probably shouldn’t
have even come.

257
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,832
It was stupid of me to even
think that I could just...

258
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:23,168
Just...

259
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,962
You know what?
Just-just hit me back.

260
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,968
-Yo, help a brother out!
-

261
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,970
I don’t...
I don’t have anything.

262
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,480
SHAWNA: Why they always
asking me for money?

263
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,565
Dang.

264
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,252
-

265
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,671
What the...

266
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,131
Hey!

267
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:12,842
Hey, leave him alone!

268
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:43,248
SHAWNA:
His skin was freezing.

269
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:47,335
Felt like-- I don’t know--
leather or something.

270
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,212
Cold leather.

271
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,549
-

272
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:17,031
-

273
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:19,534
Am I crazy?
Did that really just happen?

274
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:22,203
Was I bitten by a... vampire?

275
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,420
Vampires are for real?

276
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,089
I can’t even believe
I’m asking that.

277
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,345
Sunlight, I knew, was bad.

278
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,022
I didn’t want to turn
into a bat or nothing

279
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,190
while I was asleep.

280
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:59,574
So I decided it was best
to stay awake.

281
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,286
-

282
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:08,666
You’re up early.

283
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,751
Uh, couldn’t sleep.

284
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,127
Nightmares?

285
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,254
Something like that.

286
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:16,966
Hey, what happened to your neck?

287
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,552
Uh, curling iron.

288
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,643
Who did this?

289
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,227
I did, I guess.

290
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:30,480
You’re too old to be tearing up
the house like this, Shawn.

291
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,564
Wait, wait.

292
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,696
Get some sleep, Shawn,

293
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,658
after you take down
the rest of this.

294
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:56,214
What?

295
00:20:56,297 --> 00:21:01,427
Took me a minute to figure out
what to do, what to say.

296
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:04,681
I get how I would’ve sounded.

297
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,767
Still, I knew what I saw,
and I knew what happened to me.

298
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:14,691
Hola, Shawna.

299
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,117
Back from the dead. A miracle.

300
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,077
You know, I’ve been
hitting you up, chica.

301
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,412
I know. I know.

302
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,622
Um, can we talk?

303
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,375
In private.

304
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,299
-Okay, no way.

305
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:44,012
Get off my iPad.
Go read a book or something.

306
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,141
See why I can’t
leave this place?

307
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,727
-Everyone would be illiterate.
-

308
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,732
So, what did you want
to talk about?

309
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,109
Okay. If I tell you
what I have to tell you,

310
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,777
you can’t call me crazy,

311
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:02,030
and you have to promise
to believe me no matter what.

312
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,990
-You’re freaking me out.
-Promise!

313
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,242
Dios mío. I promise.

314
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,037
Okay.

315
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,039
That night, after the party,

316
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:14,292
I was walking home, and, uh...

317
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,960
I got, uh...

318
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:18,713
-Spit it out!
-I-I got attacked.

319
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:21,466
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

320
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,218
-Are-are you o... -By a group
of homeless vampires.

321
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,145
-Bitch, is you smoking?
-You promised.

322
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,272
Okay, uh, maybe I should
just walk you out.

323
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,356
No.

324
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,524
Look.

325
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,943
-It won’t heal right.
-

326
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,488
-What is that?
-I told you, I got attacked.

327
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,615
-Are you sure it wasn’t,
like, a dog? -Hmm-mm.

328
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,200
Homeless vampires.

329
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:50,870
Shawna, mami, you probably,
like, blacked out

330
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:53,456
and had some, like,
crazy delusion or whatever.

331
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,208
You might got the rabies.

332
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,376
Homeless vampires.

333
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,755
Well, I guess that at least

334
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,882
explains why they bit you,
right?

335
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,258
What?

336
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,219
You looked extremely homeless
that night.

337
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,055
Hello. I’m joking.

338
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,474
-There’s no... -No, they must’ve
realized I wasn’t homeless.

339
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,893
That’s why they let me go
and kept biting that other dude.

340
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,728
-What other dude? What?
-You know, the dude, the dude...

341
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,730
the dude that’s always begging
for change over on Benton.

342
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:19,440
Oh, you mean Mr. Ooh-Wee?

343
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:21,067
-He’s just a crackhead.
-Okay, well, homeless people,

344
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,819
bums, crackheads,
whatever you want to call it,

345
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,737
that’s who they’re after.

346
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:28,825
Well, if they’re after
crackheads...

347
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,077
If they’re going
after crackheads, then what?

348
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,537
Um...

349
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,375
OLD MAN:
And what goes in its place?

350
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,044
-WOMAN: Mm-hmm.
-OLD MAN: Mixed-use development?

351
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:41,504
WOMAN:
That’s right.

352
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:42,922
OLD MAN: That’s code for
"we’re not invited."

353
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,049
This is it. This-this is...

354
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:47,426
PEDRO: Shawna, there’s
no such thing as vampires.

355
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,187
Mom?

356
00:23:58,271 --> 00:23:59,689
What?

357
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,983
Where could she be?

358
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,361
Where’d she go?

359
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,996
Mom?

360
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:02,627
Mom. Mom.

361
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,505
Mom!

362
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:09,759
See? She’s fine.

363
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,346
-Let’s go.
-Listen, Mom.

364
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,139
You got to come back home now.

365
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:17,808
Okay? We’ll figure it out
later with Dad,

366
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:20,353
but it ain’t safe for you
to be living like this anymore.

367
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,482
You-you need anything else?

368
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,527
Where’s your necklace?

369
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:32,156
You know what?

370
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,033
It doesn’t matter.
We’ll come back for that.

371
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,952
Right now we just need to...

372
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,745
PEDRO:
Oh, my God.

373
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,876
That doesn’t mean anything.

374
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,003
Y-You’re all right.

375
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:48,756
Look. Look. I got it, too.

376
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,425
See? See?

377
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:53,094
I’m all right.
We both all right.

378
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,846
Just because you got bit,

379
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,599
that doesn’t mean anything.
I...

380
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:00,268
Cold leather.

381
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:10,027
Shawna! Watch out! Watch out!

382
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:15,032
-Oh, my God!
-PEDRO: Stop! Stop.

383
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:17,243
-Move! Move! Move, Shawna!

384
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,412
We got to move! Mami, mami, no!

385
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,497
Mami, no, no! Move!

386
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,046
SHAWNA
No. Oh, my God.

387
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,631
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Mami.

388
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:33,718
-Mami, we got... we got to go.
-No.

389
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,572
SHAWNA: The cops didn’t know
whether to call it

390
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:58,743
a homicide or a suicide
or an accident,

391
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:01,287
but I knew exactly
what to call it.

392
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,039
It was murder.

393
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,166
I didn’t know who or what
was responsible,

394
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,501
but I was gonna make ’em pay.

395
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:12,423
No matter what,
they were gonna pay.

396
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:25,061
-

397
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,447
SHAWNA: This is what
you wanted to show me?

398
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,115
An empty lot?

399
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:42,745
This is the house.

400
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,830
Was the house

401
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:48,876
where me, your mom and Jamal
stayed before Katrina.

402
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,712
Finally tore it down
a few years back.

403
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:54,423
And they cram us all down
on the floodplains,

404
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:57,176
knowing all they got to do
is wait for the next storm

405
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,178
just to press the reset button.

406
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:04,141
It’s not like we’re much
better off where we are now.

407
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:07,311
Another big one hits,
we’ll be in the same boat.

408
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:08,604
No pun intended.

409
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,454
Shawn, I brought you here
to talk about your mom

410
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:26,831
and how we should remember her.

411
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,040
Dad, we don’t
have to get into...

412
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:29,667
No, no, we-we do.

413
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,168
Okay? It’s important.

414
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:36,048
You know, she was grown,
so ultimately,

415
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:38,134
she’s responsible
for her mistakes.

416
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,721
Lord knows there were
plenty of those.

417
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,768
But history matters.

418
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,856
It was so chaotic after Katrina.

419
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:58,737
The help she needed
just wasn’t there,

420
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:00,823
and it never came.

421
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,287
Look, I’m not saying
things were perfect before.

422
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:10,291
I’m just saying
things definitely got worse.

423
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:14,587
And who knows how bad
it would’ve gotten

424
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,173
if it wasn’t for you?

425
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,884
-Me?
-That’s right.

426
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:22,887
She was pregnant
when the storm hit.

427
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,764
She called you her miracle baby.

428
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:29,059
She said you saved her life.

429
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:31,437
And I think she was right
about that.

430
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:40,362
I had to hide it when she left
so she wouldn’t...

431
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,494
She’d want you to have it.

432
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:52,625
Uh, the police found that one.

433
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,087
Listen, Shawn.

434
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,466
You’ve got to be brave now.

435
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:05,054
This city, this world--
it takes bravery.

436
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,597
Okay?

437
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,905
SHAWNA: I needed to know the
rules of the game I was playing.

438
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,449
Lucky for me,
New Orleans is full of people

439
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:28,202
obsessed with monsters
and magic and stuff.

440
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:30,538
I reached out to
this white girl named Granya.

441
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:33,874
She hosted a vampire book club
thing in an abandoned church.

442
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:36,627
-Weird, but I needed info,

443
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,754
and I’d get it any way I could.

444
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,965
Anne Rice, huh?
She’s from New Orleans.

445
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,008
Hometown hero.

446
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:46,595
Oh, my God, this must be what
McAdams Academy looks like.

447
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,305
What you mean?

448
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:50,182
PEDRO: Let’s just say
I’m not super excited

449
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:52,977
about being surrounded by a
bunch of white folks from Texas.

450
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,020
It’s not like they’re gonna
roll out the welcome wagon

451
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:56,689
for an immigrant kid
from Mexico,

452
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,107
no matter how fine I am.

453
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,192
-GRANYA Okay.

454
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:02,486
-See you guys next time.
-Bye.

455
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,530
GRANYA:
Hey, you must be Shawna.

456
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,240
I’m Granya.

457
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,534
So, are you guys interested
in the world of vampire fiction?

458
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:10,077
Don’t know much about fiction,

459
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,538
but I do have
some questions for you.

460
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,629
That’s a very loaded question.

461
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:22,631
There’s really no consensus

462
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:24,842
how someone gets turned
from human to vampire.

463
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:27,928
Okay, but can you just walk me
through some of the basics?

464
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:29,555
Well, there’s
the school of thought

465
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,599
that you have to be drained
of all human blood

466
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:33,934
and have it totally replaced
with vampire blood.

467
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:36,270
Ooh, or...

468
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,398
...there’s a line of thinking

469
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,066
that you have to be bitten
and the venom

470
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,651
has to overtake your system
and that’s all.

471
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:44,028
Sorry to interrupt y’all,

472
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:45,613
but why do you meet
in a place like this?

473
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:47,740
Like, why not go
to someplace less weird,

474
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,074
like a library?

475
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:51,577
The girls like the vibe--
it’s gothic--

476
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,329
and they give us
the room for free.

477
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:54,955
Oh, but you’re not, like,
a witch or whatever?

478
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,332
Presbyterian.

479
00:31:58,042 --> 00:32:00,794
Is there anything you can
tell me that’s, like, for sure--

480
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:03,505
narrow it down, why one person
would turn into a vampire

481
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:06,091
but another wouldn’t,
even if they both got bit?

482
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:10,804
They have to die.

483
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:12,765
That’s what all the stories
have in common.

484
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:16,310
So, to become a vampire,
you have to die?

485
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:17,895
If the character doesn’t die,

486
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:20,105
I don’t see how
they can become a vampire.

487
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:22,232
They’d just be
a person who survived.

488
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:23,734
Okay.

489
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:26,028
And how can a vampire die again?

490
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,905
Besides, like, sunlight.

491
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,573
Well, I mean, sunlight
is highly debatable.

492
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:32,242
Trust me, mami, no, it ain’t.

493
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:36,455
Uh, besides sunlight,
there’s fire and decapitation,

494
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,123
wooden stake through the heart.

495
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:40,209
Okay, and what if you wanted
to catch a vampire

496
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,960
but, like, just keep it alive?

497
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:43,837
Why would anyone
want to do that?

498
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:47,007
Yeah, Shawna, why would
anyone want to do that?

499
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,680
You weren’t serious in there.

500
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:54,139
Mami, we almost died
last time...

501
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:56,058
My mom did die, ’Dro.

502
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,482
What do you need me to do?

503
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,238
We need everything on this list.

504
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,657
Everything.

505
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,284
PEDRO:
Garlic, stakes and a Bible.

506
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:15,619
Shawna.

507
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:17,746
Except don’t worry
about the silver chains.

508
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,665
I can take care of that.

509
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:30,843
Oh.
-CHRIS: Oh.

510
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,344
Um, hey.

511
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:34,638
My mom wanted me
to bring these to y’all.

512
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:36,640
Red beans and rice.

513
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:38,892
She’s sorry she missed
the repass.

514
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:41,311
Thanks.

515
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:45,566
Uh, come in.

516
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:54,950
You know, she said she used
to kick it with your mom

517
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,285
in the Calliope,

518
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,830
play spades and shit,
before they tore it down.

519
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,039
I ain’t know that.

520
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:02,332
Yeah, me, neither.

521
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:08,297
I guess that sort of
makes us peoples.

522
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,716
-Guess so.
-

523
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:19,224
-Jamal around?
-Mm-mm.

524
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:22,811
Do, uh, they know
what went down yet?

525
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:26,023
Nah, not yet.

526
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,984
Do they think it was, like...

527
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,653
Did somebody kill her?

528
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,572
She wouldn’t have
done it to herself.

529
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,660
Look, if you or Jamal
ever catch wind

530
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:41,538
of any nigga that might’ve had
something to do with it,

531
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:43,123
I got y’all’s back.

532
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:45,125
Mm-hmm.

533
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:52,090
Chris.

534
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:54,092
You for real about
having my back?

535
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:55,302
Yeah.

536
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:57,304
OLD MAN:
If they tear down the Ombreux,

537
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:58,597
what will we do?

538
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,848
Where will we go?

539
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:01,433
They’re taking everything
from us:

540
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,852
our low-income houses,
our jobs...

541
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:05,687
What you think of that dude?

542
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:07,481
I think he crazy.

543
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:08,649
Maybe.

544
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:09,900
He ain’t wrong, though.

545
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,860
-He ain’t?
-Me and you, we lucky.

546
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:13,654
We don’t got to stay
in the projects.

547
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:15,656
But a lot of people,
this all they got.

548
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,199
The Ombreux?

549
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:18,826
I mean, I guess.

550
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:20,702
Why you think
so many people left

551
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,579
after the storm
and never came back home?

552
00:35:22,663 --> 00:35:24,248
Ombreux’s the last
of the bricks.

553
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:26,333
I mean, where people
’posed to live?

554
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:28,585
Well, like you said,

555
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:31,171
lucky for us,
we got another place to stay.

556
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:33,173
For now.

557
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,343
SHAWNA:
Did you get it?

558
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:38,095
-Uh...
-Chris, this is ’Dro.

559
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:40,097
’Dro, this is Chris.

560
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:43,517
Uh, can I talk to you
real quick, mami?

561
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,435
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

562
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:49,273
Okay, what is he doing here?

563
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:51,859
We’re not exactly the strongest,
fastest people in New Orleans.

564
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:53,610
I hold, like,
three city-wide track records.

565
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:55,028
You know what I mean.

566
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:56,780
-Does he know about...
-Not yet.

567
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:59,074
Shawna, I really don’t think
right now is the right time

568
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,701
for you to be making
a love connection.

569
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,578
I’m not making
a love connection. I-I...

570
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,830
So, uh, the guy that did it,
where’s he at?

571
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,915
Okay, I don’t know
if he did it or not,

572
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:09,585
but he might know who did.

573
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,879
Same shit. Let’s go.

574
00:36:13,422 --> 00:36:15,299
SHAWNA
Right.

575
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:05,307
PEDRO:
Maybe we should just go.

576
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:09,394
Are you sure
dude even stays here?

577
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:12,940
How did you even
find out ’bout him?

578
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:14,441
Just a hunch, I guess.

579
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,526
A hunch?

580
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:18,946
-

581
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:20,489
CHRIS:
Shit.

582
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:23,700
Probably just a...

583
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,162
...rat, right?

584
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,247
Maybe we should just go.

585
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:31,249
Geez, ’Dro,
you always got to be...

586
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:34,211
-

587
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:48,016
-

588
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,824
CHRIS:
So you killed your own mom?

589
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:06,076
Yeah.

590
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,120
Well, no, I mean...

591
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,789
It-it’s really whoever’s
responsible for making her...

592
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,624
A vampire.

593
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:14,960
Fuck.

594
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,336
Okay, you shouldn’t
have brung him.

595
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,046
You don’t drop shit
like that on people.

596
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,589
He’ll be fine.
I mean, it’s just...

597
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:22,259
It’s just a lot
to j-just, like, process.

598
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,345
And what about our other amigo?

599
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:27,973
Time to get some answers.

600
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,518
MARVIN:
I don’t know that damn woman!

601
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,062
Old Marvin never turned nobody.

602
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:36,273
-If not you, then who?
-Uh...

603
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,650
now, if I tell you,
they’re gonna kill old Marvin.

604
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:40,193
Again.

605
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:43,238
CHRIS: What makes you think
we won’t kill you, nigga?

606
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,907
For someone who hates himself,
you sure looked happy as hell

607
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,701
when you was about to chomp down
on a nigga’s neck.

608
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:50,078
Oh, man, I...
I couldn’t help it, bruh.

609
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:51,371
I ain’t ate in days.

610
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:52,998
Who’s turning people
into vampires?

611
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:55,208
Oh...

612
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:04,885
Y’all had garlic in there?

613
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:07,054
Y’all-y’all playing foul, bruh.

614
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:10,265
Don’t-don’t...
don’t come no closer.

615
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,309
-What’s it feel like?

616
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:15,187
You been tear-gassed
by the police?

617
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:18,774
No, but I’m guessing by
your nosebleed I don’t want to.

618
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:22,569
Tell us what we want to know.

619
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:25,614
-

620
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,368
-Straight like that.
-Okay.

621
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:32,412
Okay, okay, I’ll tell you.

622
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:36,166
Just get that shit
away from me, man.

623
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:41,379
It’s this nigga named Lefrak.

624
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:43,090
He building an army.

625
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:44,800
-An army for what?
-I...

626
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,427
I don’t know, but any homeless

627
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:50,555
or any addict down on his luck,
that’s who he’s enlisting.

628
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,265
How do we get to him?

629
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:54,434
You can’t.
He don’t fuck with humans.

630
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:56,561
He got to eat, right?
Human blood?

631
00:39:56,645 --> 00:39:58,605
Where does he stay?
Where does he stay?!

632
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:00,023
-

633
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:02,359
An old mansion
down in the French Quarter.

634
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:06,071
He’s always got that
red Escalade parked out front.

635
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,367
Truth be told,

636
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,870
I hope you get
Lefrak’s bitch ass.

637
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:18,083
’Cause if he dies,

638
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:21,002
they say we all
turn back to normal.

639
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:22,212
You think that’s true?

640
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:24,172
Too bad you won’t
be alive to find out.

641
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:25,674
-Huh? -We let you go,
next thing you know,

642
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,634
we up on some vampire hit list.

643
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,261
Oh, no, no.

644
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:30,720
How you kill
one of these bitches?

645
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:31,847
Wait. Hold up.

646
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,682
No one said nothing
about no murder.

647
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:34,975
I think we use a wooden stake.

648
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,560
-PEDRO: What?
-What?

649
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:39,271
Shawna, what are you doing?

650
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:41,148
Chris is right, ’Dro.

651
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:43,191
We can’t have him snitching
before we get to Lefrak.

652
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:44,568
Get to Lefrak? Mami...

653
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,069
-

654
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:49,948
I ain’t gonna drop
a dime on you, baby.

655
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:53,285
Old Marvin
never turned on nobody.

656
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:57,956
SHAWNA:
I have to get to Lefrak, ’Dro.

657
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,583
And if this works,
I’m-a put a stake

658
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:02,043
-right through his heart, too.
-Come on, bruh.

659
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:05,463
Y’all can’t do me like this.

660
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:08,133
-Through the heart, right?
-

661
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,343
Guys, let’s just
think this through.

662
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:12,762
Yeah!
Let’s think this thing through.

663
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:14,139
-I untie you right now...
-Shawna.

664
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,765
...tell you
you can have every drop

665
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:18,518
of his sweet Mexican blood,
what you do?

666
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:32,866
I told you.

667
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,043
SHAWNA:
Wait.

668
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,337
This is my beef.

669
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,130
I should do it.

670
00:41:47,214 --> 00:41:49,257
You sure?

671
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,220
No, not really.

672
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:55,388
But I gotta.

673
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:56,932
Get him, then, killer.

674
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,850
PEDRO:
Shawna.

675
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:03,146
Come on.
Do you really want to do this?

676
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:12,697
-

677
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:15,575
-

678
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:35,553
Hmm.

679
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:39,349
Huh.

680
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:42,269
Hmm.

681
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:01,454
Yo, can I holla at you
for a second?

682
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:04,499
Look, I don’t do surprises,

683
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,918
especially not surprises
about monsters and shit.

684
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:08,503
Look, I’m sorry.

685
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,839
Look, obviously,
it won’t ever happen again.

686
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:13,049
Give me your phone.

687
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:18,346
Whatever y’all do
to this Lefrak cat...

688
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:21,558
SHAWNA:
Dang. He fine even when he mad.

689
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,813
...I want in.

690
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:28,857
Uh, yeah.

691
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,442
Yeah, o-okay.

692
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:31,818
I’ll call you.

693
00:43:45,415 --> 00:43:47,667
SHAWNA: Lefrak’s mansion
in the Quarter-- check.

694
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:50,670
Lefrak’s red Escalade
parked out front-- check.

695
00:43:50,754 --> 00:43:54,174
Me getting inside and putting
a stake through his heart--

696
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:56,593
to be determined.

697
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:00,597
Why are you staring at me, punk?

698
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:08,313
What?

699
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:13,943
You know, I researched
this house some.

700
00:44:14,027 --> 00:44:16,029
Anything that can help us
get to Lefrak?

701
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:18,156
No, but some pretty cool
history stuff.

702
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:20,450
-About?
-What have I told you is

703
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:23,453
the alpha and omega of
this here New Orleans history?

704
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:24,871
Slavery?

705
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:26,790
The man who built this house,

706
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:29,084
one of the most notorious
slave owners in Louisiana.

707
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,795
Little bitch owned
400 slaves at his peak.

708
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:33,671
-Ugh.
-Savage.

709
00:44:33,755 --> 00:44:35,298
He must have really loved it.

710
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:36,800
Held on to the bitter end.

711
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:38,885
Built an underground
tunnel system to hide

712
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:40,095
his slaves from Union soldiers.

713
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,055
Yeah, history. Cool.

714
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:43,515
Okay, can we focus on the now?

715
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:46,393
All right, well,
it’s getting late.

716
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:48,395
-The sun is gonna go down.
-Uh-uh. We’re never gonna

717
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:50,397
see nothing if we leave
every day before dark.

718
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,065
They’re vampires. Duh.

719
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:53,566
Mami, you know
what could happen.

720
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:55,860
Stop acting
like such a girl, ’Dro.

721
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:57,737
Okay, fine. If you want
to stay, that’s fine,

722
00:44:57,821 --> 00:45:00,448
but don’t expect me to put
my fine Mexican ass on the line

723
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:02,617
’cause you want to act
all stupid.

724
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,370
-I’m leaving, for real.
-Okay.

725
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:09,624
And don’t even try to stop me.

726
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:10,875
Bye.

727
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:25,306
I can’t believe
we’re doing this.

728
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,728
That’s the third pair
to come out of there tonight.

729
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,278
Vampires like hos.

730
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:40,029
So what?

731
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:42,449
SHAWNA: I had a plan,
but I needed another girl.

732
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:45,785
I knew just the person
crazy enough to do it with me.

733
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:49,789
In fact, she went straight
SAT prep mode on my ass.

734
00:45:49,873 --> 00:45:52,375
GRANYA:
So, this one says it’s possible

735
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:53,835
for some vampires to use

736
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:56,754
psychic mind control attacks
on their victims.

737
00:45:56,838 --> 00:45:58,673
So...

738
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:02,802
So, doesn’t that explain why
the ladies of the night...

739
00:46:02,886 --> 00:46:05,263
-Ladies of the night?
-The prostitutes.

740
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,474
Oh, the hos. Right.

741
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:10,602
Lefrak probably used
some kind of mind control

742
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:12,979
to make them forget
about the feeding.

743
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:14,522
Makes sense.

744
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:17,192
Okay, but if he uses that on me,
I’m a goner, right?

745
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:18,443
Not exactly.

746
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:20,361
I read up
on psychological attacks,

747
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:22,155
and I came across
this military study

748
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:23,364
from, like, World War II.

749
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:26,242
Okay. And?

750
00:46:26,326 --> 00:46:28,244
If Lefrak tries
to hypnotize you or whatever,

751
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:30,413
just, you know, remember
something from your past

752
00:46:30,497 --> 00:46:32,665
to keep you in the real world
and out of dreamland.

753
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:34,751
So I just need to think
of a memory?

754
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:37,170
-That’s it?
-That’s it.

755
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:40,340
Hey, do you think
I’ll meet a cute one?

756
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:42,926
I cannot believe I’m doing this.

757
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:44,886
I can’t believe
I’m on this side of town,

758
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,638
in this store, doing this.

759
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:49,307
I take it this ain’t
your typical afternoon activity.

760
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,767
Uh, no.

761
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,810
My parents keep my itinerary
pretty full.

762
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,145
With what?

763
00:46:54,229 --> 00:46:56,689
With diving, chess, debate team,

764
00:46:56,773 --> 00:46:58,525
Model UN, drama.

765
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:00,944
Oh, and Mandarin and French.

766
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:03,655
And like a thousand other things
I’m probably forgetting.

767
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:11,204
SHAWNA:
We’re gonna need some makeup.

768
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:21,256
So, while me and Granya
worked on our entrance plan...

769
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:24,884
We got pizza,
extra garlic powder.

770
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:27,762
SHAWNA: ...Chris and Pedro
worked on our exit plan.

771
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:33,393
And I worked on
the plan of attack-- alone.

772
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:35,061
Even with help,
it was pretty nuts

773
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:36,563
to think I could pull this off.

774
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:38,064
I’m not Buffy.

775
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:41,693
I’m just--
I don’t know-- Shawna.

776
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,903
But I wasn’t about
to give up now.

777
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:49,325
Night before, couldn’t sleep.

778
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:54,080
Day of, couldn’t eat.

779
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:57,542
STEVEN:
All right, headed out.

780
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:08,928
-Where are you going?
- Oh.

781
00:48:10,138 --> 00:48:11,556
What are you doing?

782
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,933
What does it look like?

783
00:48:14,017 --> 00:48:15,560
It look like you giving up.

784
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,979
Dead is dead, Shawna.

785
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,359
Don’t stay out too late.

786
00:48:31,284 --> 00:48:33,036
Okay, are we good
with the getaway plan?

787
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,579
-Yeah.
-Let’s do it, then.

788
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:36,748
Wait. I actually need
someone to help me

789
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:38,291
tape the stake to my leg.

790
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:41,252
Um, okay. Can you hold it?

791
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:45,715
Thanks.

792
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:47,634
Why doesn’t mine look like that?

793
00:48:47,717 --> 00:48:49,719
Fashion 101, mami:
big risk, bigger reward.

794
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,596
I couldn’t figure out
where to hide it

795
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:53,681
’cause there’s not much room
for a stake, but...

796
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:55,058
I was thinking maybe my leg...

797
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:57,685
I’ll do it. Okay.

798
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:16,537
Too tight?

799
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:18,831
Perfect.

800
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:26,714
-Hey, I have a question.
-

801
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:28,716
I know why Pedro’s helping me.

802
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,134
He’s my best friend.

803
00:49:30,218 --> 00:49:32,220
And Granya, well, she’s, like,

804
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:34,555
obsessed with vampires,
so it’s a no-brainer, but...

805
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:36,766
you I don’t really get.

806
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:38,685
I mean, I’m-I’m happy
that you’re doing it.

807
00:49:38,768 --> 00:49:40,812
Just, um...

808
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:41,896
why?

809
00:49:44,357 --> 00:49:46,275
Let’s just go kill
some vampires.

810
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:49,278
Okay.

811
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:02,792
SHAWNA:
This was it.

812
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:09,340
I didn’t have time to
figure out why I had a stalker.

813
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,636
Revenge was just
a few steps away.

814
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:37,744
-GRANYA: Wait.

815
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:39,245
I don’t want to do this.

816
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:40,705
-This is a horrible idea.
-No, it’s too late.

817
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:41,998
-MAN: Yeah?
-

818
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:46,210
I get it.
You looking for Lefrak.

819
00:50:46,294 --> 00:50:48,629
You got your days mixed up.
Come back Thursday.

820
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:51,549
Uh, we were told
to come tonight.

821
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,472
You know what?

822
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:00,016
I thought y’all had money,
and we were really ready

823
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:02,852
to get down tonight,
so just forget it.

824
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,479
We don’t have time for no games.

825
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:06,189
-MAN: Hold up.

826
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,652
Y’all are too young...

827
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:15,364
and too delicious
to let walk away.

828
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:19,285
Y’all go chill inside.

829
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:21,621
I’ll see if Lefrak’s ready.

830
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:24,791
Mmm.

831
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:43,059
-

832
00:51:52,777 --> 00:51:55,071
OLD MAN:
I was once on the bottom, too.

833
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:57,573
But now we all have new life.

834
00:51:57,657 --> 00:51:58,908
We’ve been reborn.

835
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:02,328
This time on top.

836
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:05,957
Those days of us
being pushed aside,

837
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,377
forgotten and abused--
well, those days are gone

838
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,462
so long as you’re willing
to fight.

839
00:52:11,546 --> 00:52:13,589
-Fight back!
-

840
00:52:13,673 --> 00:52:15,216
We must...

841
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:22,598
Just make sure that
you take them all with you.

842
00:52:22,682 --> 00:52:23,891
Be hungry.

843
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:25,685
-Are you with me?
-OTHERS: Yeah!

844
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:31,440
All right.
Who wants to go first?

845
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:36,153
Come on, then.

846
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:38,322
Lefrak is ready for you.

847
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:18,613
-I usually don’t like my girls
as dark as you. -

848
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,450
Sorry.

849
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:23,951
What you lack in beauty

850
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:26,287
you more than make up for
in youth.

851
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:29,040
And I like ’em young.

852
00:53:52,355 --> 00:53:54,190
No silver.

853
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:23,177
SHAWNA:
Cold leather.

854
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,400
Yo. They’re in.

855
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:39,402
-Got the garlic powder?
-Yeah.

856
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:42,238
All right, let’s get this pumped
through the windows.

857
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:44,991
Ready?

858
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:07,805
Don’t be scared.

859
00:55:14,854 --> 00:55:17,023
-I ain’t.
-Mm.

860
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:28,534
I...

861
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:30,870
I need to use the bathroom.

862
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,724
LEFRAK:
Hurry up in there.

863
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:07,615
Don’t we need a rubber?

864
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:10,534
Not for what I’m about to do.

865
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:31,263
Look deep into my eyes.

866
00:56:33,474 --> 00:56:34,767
SHAWNA:
Mind control.

867
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,352
Relax.

868
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:38,395
SHAWNA:
I needed a memory.

869
00:56:38,479 --> 00:56:40,731
I needed a memory quick.

870
00:56:58,374 --> 00:57:01,127
You won’t remember me.

871
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:03,587
You won’t remember.

872
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:06,298
Do you know where you are?

873
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:09,552
I can’t remember.

874
00:57:37,413 --> 00:57:39,748
What is going on here?

875
00:58:09,862 --> 00:58:12,198
OLD MAN:
Get Lefrak!

876
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:24,293
-

877
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:26,503
Come on.

878
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:29,798
She did it. Come on.

879
00:58:45,231 --> 00:58:47,024
Who are you?

880
00:58:48,234 --> 00:58:50,569
I’m Denise’s daughter.

881
00:58:50,653 --> 00:58:52,488
Who is Den...

882
00:58:55,491 --> 00:58:57,576
-She good?
-You okay?

883
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,370
-Oh, no.

884
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:00,537
Get back!

885
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:04,458
Go. Go. I got it.

886
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:18,973
-CHRIS: You all right?
-SHAWNA: Yeah, I guess.

887
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:20,391
CHRIS:
Let’s bounce.

888
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:24,311
Come on. Let’s go. Let’s go.

889
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:35,489
Four children
are leaving the house.

890
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:40,619
Bring them to me.

891
00:59:40,703 --> 00:59:42,371
Dead, alive-- I don’t care!

892
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:43,998
It doesn’t matter!

893
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:02,057
Yo, Chris. What you doing here?

894
01:00:02,141 --> 01:00:03,600
I’m with Shawna.

895
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:10,357
You guys sure you don’t
want to take a shower?

896
01:00:10,441 --> 01:00:11,984
We have plenty of clean towels.

897
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:13,861
Shawna, did you know
that Pedro got into

898
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:15,988
McAdams Academy in Texas
and he’s not gonna go?

899
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:18,532
-Mm-hmm. -That’s, like, one of
the top schools in the country.

900
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,159
I would’ve killed to go there.

901
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:22,077
Look, I belong in New Orleans
and nowhere else, okay?

902
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:23,954
It ain’t that deep.
He just scared of white people.

903
01:00:24,038 --> 01:00:26,874
Fair enough. White people are
sort of terrifying. I get it.

904
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:28,334
I’m not scared.

905
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:29,960
Let’s just stay focused
on vampire stuff.

906
01:00:30,044 --> 01:00:32,921
CHRIS: Well, I guess we know,
if you kill the leader,

907
01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:35,049
shit stays the same.

908
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:36,884
Except maybe we didn’t
kill the leader.

909
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,927
Let me see those pictures.

910
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:45,059
There he is.

911
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:46,769
That’s the street preacher
from the Ombreux.

912
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:49,229
Yeah. He’s operating
out of the same house

913
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:50,647
he was a slave in.

914
01:00:50,731 --> 01:00:52,608
That’s sort of poetic.

915
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:54,151
Okay, so this little bitch is

916
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:55,652
a crazy street preacher
and an ex-slave vampire.

917
01:00:55,736 --> 01:00:57,112
That doesn’t mean
he’s the leader, though.

918
01:00:57,196 --> 01:00:59,615
No, but the way
he was talking in there.

919
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:01,617
His whole-- I don’t know-- vibe.

920
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,453
-I think he was in charge.
-CHRIS: Could be.

921
01:01:04,536 --> 01:01:06,246
Okay, b-but we took
our only shot, mami.

922
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:07,873
Not like we can
go back there now.

923
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,170
Damn, Shawna,
what’s your problem?

924
01:01:13,253 --> 01:01:14,922
-Okay.
-

925
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:16,715
Okay, wh-what...
what should we do?

926
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:18,592
-Calm down.

927
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,844
If it’s them, they can’t come in
unless we invite them.

928
01:01:20,928 --> 01:01:22,221
-"Them"?
-We should go.

929
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:24,098
-Go where?
-

930
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:25,349
Go away!

931
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:27,393
-It’s okay. They can’t come in.
-

932
01:01:27,476 --> 01:01:29,061
Should we jump out the window?

933
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:31,772
Out the window? What the fuck
is wrong with y’all?

934
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:33,774
-Y’all smoking or something?
-Are you guys even listening?

935
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:35,067
There are rules.

936
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:36,652
-They can’t come in.
-We got stakes.

937
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:37,945
-Stakes? What...
-

938
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:39,029
I said go away!

939
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,834
-Go! -Oh, shit!

940
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:53,293
-CHRIS: Jamal!
-Oh, shit!

941
01:01:55,421 --> 01:01:56,588
Jamal!

942
01:02:03,804 --> 01:02:05,222
GRANYA:
This can’t happen!

943
01:02:17,818 --> 01:02:19,486
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

944
01:02:57,065 --> 01:02:58,734
-

945
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:16,502
-

946
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,353
-

947
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:37,022
CHRIS: Yo, Granya, I thought
you said they couldn’t come in.

948
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:38,899
GRANYA:
Sorry.

949
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:49,576
Say, bruh, one of y’all
better tell me

950
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:51,870
what the fuck is going on.

951
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:55,707
SHAWNA:
Turns out my cabbie stalker

952
01:03:55,791 --> 01:03:58,627
goes by the name of Tunde.

953
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:00,546
At 800 years old, he was

954
01:04:00,629 --> 01:04:03,215
one of the oldest vampires
in the world.

955
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:05,509
Tunde told us
there are several covens

956
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:08,178
and he’d been at war with the
street preacher named Babineaux

957
01:04:08,262 --> 01:04:10,556
for over a century.

958
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:16,895
Tunde told us that Babineaux
was once a slave in the city.

959
01:04:16,979 --> 01:04:18,397
-

960
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,024
That he’s seen
the worst in humanity.

961
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:22,734
-

962
01:04:22,818 --> 01:04:26,280
One night, he was attacked
by a vampire...

963
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:28,615
-

964
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:32,077
...and turned.

965
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:35,914
Babineaux took power
into his own hands

966
01:04:35,998 --> 01:04:38,166
and killed his master.

967
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:44,214
And from the ashes
rose a new power.

968
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:49,511
After Katrina, he became worse.

969
01:04:49,595 --> 01:04:51,847
And as the gap between
the haves and have-nots

970
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:54,266
-continues to grow...
-

971
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:56,310
he believes
it’s time for action.

972
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:01,106
He’s been building an army
right under humans’ noses,

973
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:04,610
seeking the down-and-out
and turning them into soldiers,

974
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:07,529
as he thinks
they will not be missed.

975
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:12,534
Babineaux is
a vampire supremacist,

976
01:05:12,618 --> 01:05:15,245
one of the last coven leaders
to think this way.

977
01:05:15,329 --> 01:05:17,789
He looks at humans
the way a lion does a gazelle.

978
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:21,501
Just prey.

979
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:28,759
Um, if you a vampire,
how come you ain’t eat us?

980
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:31,011
With modern-day technology,

981
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:33,680
it is archaic to eat humans.

982
01:05:33,764 --> 01:05:35,515
So, why were you watching me?

983
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,976
I was there to observe
Babineaux.

984
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:41,521
You were just
a curious variable.

985
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:42,898
And the sun?

986
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:45,025
TUNDE: The sun is
a nuisance to new vampires.

987
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:49,029
It hasn’t affected me
in about 500 or 600 years.

988
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:53,075
Survival in the daylight
is possible with time...

989
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:55,494
and melanin.

990
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:57,871
Only vampires
with an ample supply

991
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,916
can endure the light.

992
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:03,627
It’s like a superpower.

993
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:06,380
Then you’d make
a good vampire, then, Wesley.

994
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,589
Why do you call her that?

995
01:06:07,673 --> 01:06:09,549
’Cause she mad black
like Wesley Snipes.

996
01:06:13,387 --> 01:06:15,138
When I was a boy,

997
01:06:15,222 --> 01:06:19,184
long before I was like this,

998
01:06:19,267 --> 01:06:21,395
in my village,

999
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:25,357
there was what
you might call a princess--

1000
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,234
the chief’s daughter.

1001
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:30,987
Her skin was as dark
as the nighttime ocean.

1002
01:06:31,071 --> 01:06:34,783
All of the other girls
were envious

1003
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:37,452
and spent hours in the sun

1004
01:06:37,536 --> 01:06:40,789
trying to look just like her.

1005
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:45,335
She was the most beautiful girl
I have ever seen.

1006
01:06:46,545 --> 01:06:48,630
You are not unlike her.

1007
01:06:48,714 --> 01:06:52,342
Your brother
or anyone in your presence

1008
01:06:52,426 --> 01:06:54,970
should consider themselves
very lucky.

1009
01:06:57,389 --> 01:06:59,558
I agree with Tunde.

1010
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:02,102
You’re beautiful.

1011
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:04,146
PEDRO:
Yeah. Me, too.

1012
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:07,190
It’s your sister, dude.

1013
01:07:11,737 --> 01:07:13,488
I missed the fight!

1014
01:07:13,572 --> 01:07:15,031
TUNDE:
Yakubu...

1015
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:18,034
while I’m away,
watch over these children.

1016
01:07:18,118 --> 01:07:19,703
Watch us? Where you going?

1017
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:22,205
I’m going to put an end
to Babineaux’s antics.

1018
01:07:22,289 --> 01:07:24,499
Okay, if you’re getting
Babineaux, I want to go.

1019
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:29,045
Shawna, what you did
with Lefrak was very brave.

1020
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:31,006
But it was also
incredibly foolish.

1021
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:34,301
You have disturbed
an uneasy peace.

1022
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:35,594
Stay with Yakubu.

1023
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:37,387
He’s strong and trustworthy.

1024
01:07:37,471 --> 01:07:39,097
He will keep you safe
until the morning.

1025
01:07:39,181 --> 01:07:40,432
You can’t cut me out of this.

1026
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:43,143
You are no longer part of this.

1027
01:07:52,027 --> 01:07:53,403
Mm-mm.

1028
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:58,658
I brought you two forks
so you could share.

1029
01:07:58,742 --> 01:08:00,827
CHRIS:
What is that?

1030
01:08:00,911 --> 01:08:02,621
I don’t know. Dad made it.

1031
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:04,664
Yeah, I think maybe
I’ll take that shower after all.

1032
01:08:10,921 --> 01:08:13,089
I think I’m good.

1033
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:20,514
My brother.

1034
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:21,932
Huh?

1035
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:25,602
Earlier, you asked me
why I wanted to help you.

1036
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:27,938
My brother.

1037
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:30,857
He’s on that stuff,
just like your moms was.

1038
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:34,486
Oh.

1039
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:38,824
Wait, so I did see you
over at the Ombreux.

1040
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:41,368
It’s embarrassing.

1041
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:44,496
Is your brother, um...

1042
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:46,331
I mean, did he get
turned into a...

1043
01:08:46,414 --> 01:08:48,291
A vampire? Nah.

1044
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:49,960
He came home last week.

1045
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:51,795
Not sure it really matters,
though.

1046
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:52,879
What you mean?

1047
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:55,090
I don’t know who to be mad at:

1048
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:57,050
Kelvin...

1049
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,761
dealers, crooked-ass cops,
my folks.

1050
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:01,680
But you,

1051
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:04,099
you got somebody
to take it out on.

1052
01:09:06,226 --> 01:09:08,103
I guess I...

1053
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:10,355
sort of wanted in on that.

1054
01:09:11,857 --> 01:09:13,400
Guess it makes me
sort of selfish...

1055
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:16,444
No, it don’t.

1056
01:09:16,528 --> 01:09:18,947
I understand.

1057
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:21,241
I thought you might.

1058
01:09:28,582 --> 01:09:30,458
I meant what I said earlier.

1059
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,839
You’re beautiful.

1060
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,095
I am, aren’t I?

1061
01:09:44,264 --> 01:09:45,640
Yo, and humble, too.

1062
01:09:45,724 --> 01:09:47,893
¡Ay, Dios!

1063
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:54,065
-Oh...

1064
01:09:55,734 --> 01:09:57,694
He’ll be all right.

1065
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:06,703
-

1066
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:10,498
Babineaux is not here.

1067
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:17,547
-

1068
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:19,132
It’s been too long.

1069
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,509
-Yeah.
-We’ve been waiting.

1070
01:10:21,593 --> 01:10:23,219
That was Tunde.

1071
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:24,763
Did they get Babineaux?

1072
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:26,097
The coward is hiding somewhere.

1073
01:10:26,181 --> 01:10:27,557
So, what are we supposed to do?

1074
01:10:27,641 --> 01:10:28,850
Wait until they find him.

1075
01:10:28,934 --> 01:10:31,061
It’s shaping up
to be a long night.

1076
01:10:35,941 --> 01:10:38,234
CHRIS:
So, where did Babineaux go?

1077
01:10:38,318 --> 01:10:39,945
He couldn’t have gone far,
right?

1078
01:10:42,656 --> 01:10:45,241
The tunnels-- under the mansion.

1079
01:10:45,325 --> 01:10:46,701
If they were built
to hide slaves,

1080
01:10:46,785 --> 01:10:48,286
Babineaux would know about them.

1081
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:49,621
-We should tell Tunde.
-CHRIS: We should go.

1082
01:10:49,704 --> 01:10:51,581
What? Chris.

1083
01:10:51,665 --> 01:10:53,875
I have extra stakes
under my bed.

1084
01:10:53,959 --> 01:10:55,835
Shawna.

1085
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:58,004
Listen, ’Dro, if you don’t
want to go, it’s cool.

1086
01:10:58,088 --> 01:10:59,547
You’ve done enough already.

1087
01:10:59,631 --> 01:11:01,633
Shawna, you know
I’ve supported you

1088
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:04,719
in every crazy thing you wanted
to do since your mom passed.

1089
01:11:04,803 --> 01:11:08,640
Trust me when I say this is
the worst idea of them all.

1090
01:11:14,145 --> 01:11:15,563
Give me a stake.

1091
01:11:36,835 --> 01:11:39,254
I’m going to that
boarding school in Texas.

1092
01:11:39,337 --> 01:11:42,215
I mean, if we make it
out of this shit alive,

1093
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:44,509
-then yeah, I’m going.
-

1094
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:45,885
I just... I figured,

1095
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:47,721
if you can fight vampires
over the summer,

1096
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:51,641
then I can deal with a bunch of
white folks for a couple years.

1097
01:11:53,143 --> 01:11:55,812
And I-I deserve it.

1098
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:58,398
Family will be fine.

1099
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:01,609
You’ll be fine.

1100
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:05,739
But if I don’t go, I won’t be.

1101
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:08,366
Don’t worry,
I’ll come back and visit

1102
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:10,618
-your trifling ass
for Carnival. -Oh, shut up.

1103
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:20,003
What y’all doing?

1104
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:21,755
We’re gonna go get Babineaux.

1105
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:23,339
For Mom.

1106
01:12:46,154 --> 01:12:47,864
Hey, Yakubu?

1107
01:12:47,947 --> 01:12:48,990
What is it?

1108
01:12:49,074 --> 01:12:51,201
-JAMAL: Go!

1109
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:52,577
Go, go, go!

1110
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:59,084
We got to hurry.

1111
01:13:07,258 --> 01:13:09,677
-I don’t think I’m going.
-What?

1112
01:13:09,761 --> 01:13:11,012
Why not?

1113
01:13:11,096 --> 01:13:13,264
Vampires aren’t
so much fun in real life.

1114
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:15,558
Yeah, I guess they ain’t.

1115
01:13:15,642 --> 01:13:18,353
SAT prep sounds pretty good
right about now.

1116
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,567
SHAWNA:
Thanks.

1117
01:13:24,651 --> 01:13:25,902
For everything.

1118
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:27,529
Okay.

1119
01:13:27,612 --> 01:13:28,947
GRANYA:
Good luck.

1120
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:31,282
Go kick some vampire butt
for me.

1121
01:13:38,832 --> 01:13:41,000
-Yo. Get down.

1122
01:13:58,268 --> 01:14:00,270
The tunnels.

1123
01:15:17,305 --> 01:15:19,015
-

1124
01:16:53,735 --> 01:16:56,529
-

1125
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:58,948
You missed!

1126
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:04,287
-No. No, no, no.

1127
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:05,913
-No. Shawna, Shawna!
-BABINEAUX: Feast.

1128
01:17:05,997 --> 01:17:09,417
Shawna, help me! Help me!

1129
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:19,177
SHAWNA:
No, Pedro!

1130
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,888
-Pedro, no.
-

1131
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:25,767
Pedro.

1132
01:17:28,061 --> 01:17:29,479
Chris.

1133
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:31,689
Chris, Chris, Chris, Chris.

1134
01:17:31,773 --> 01:17:34,442
-

1135
01:17:57,465 --> 01:17:59,133
I only want to talk.

1136
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:07,934
Only a loss could make you
this determined, this angry.

1137
01:18:08,726 --> 01:18:10,895
Who did you lose?

1138
01:18:20,071 --> 01:18:21,489
My mother.

1139
01:18:23,533 --> 01:18:25,326
You stole her from me.

1140
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:27,954
I gave your mother power!

1141
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:31,582
I gave her a shot
at immortality.

1142
01:18:31,666 --> 01:18:34,085
-It was a gift.
-A gift?

1143
01:18:34,168 --> 01:18:35,545
She’s dead.

1144
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:39,590
Well, every great struggle
has its martyrs.

1145
01:18:39,674 --> 01:18:41,426
What?

1146
01:18:41,509 --> 01:18:44,595
They put us down,
they-they kick us,

1147
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:47,765
and then they wonder why we
haven’t gotten up on our own.

1148
01:18:47,849 --> 01:18:50,351
I’ve watched it for centuries.

1149
01:18:50,435 --> 01:18:52,353
I saw it when we were in chains.

1150
01:18:52,437 --> 01:18:55,356
I saw it when we were
in the back of the bus.

1151
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,359
I see it now as they push us
from our homes.

1152
01:18:58,443 --> 01:19:00,194
But why? I mean, why now?

1153
01:19:00,278 --> 01:19:02,321
This is the beginning
of the end for us in this city.

1154
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:04,365
The Ombreux was the last straw.

1155
01:19:04,449 --> 01:19:07,285
-What? -When Katrina
didn’t swallow us up,

1156
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:09,871
well, they... then they turned
to development.

1157
01:19:09,954 --> 01:19:12,748
Soon, there won’t be enough
of us left to band together.

1158
01:19:12,832 --> 01:19:14,375
Band together?

1159
01:19:14,459 --> 01:19:16,252
I mean,
you’re-you’re a murderer.

1160
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:19,255
All the protests we’ve had,
all the marches we’ve done.

1161
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:20,965
People want to make
a difference.

1162
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:22,842
You could’ve just convinced us
to just fight with you.

1163
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:25,761
The marches,
the protests, the riots.

1164
01:19:25,845 --> 01:19:28,389
Slave revolts. I’ve seen it all.

1165
01:19:28,473 --> 01:19:33,561
1859, 1968, 1992, 2020.

1166
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:37,148
All bright flames
that suddenly got snuffed out.

1167
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:39,567
But when you’re immortal,

1168
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:43,446
you get to watch
the whole big picture.

1169
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:46,073
You learn how to stoke
the flames,

1170
01:19:46,157 --> 01:19:47,825
to keep it burning.

1171
01:19:49,827 --> 01:19:51,579
That’s what I’m doing.

1172
01:19:51,662 --> 01:19:52,955
You’re sick.

1173
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:54,540
You should just give up now

1174
01:19:54,624 --> 01:19:56,292
’cause Tunde’s already
destroyed your army.

1175
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:58,503
I’ll just have to build
another one, won’t I?

1176
01:19:58,586 --> 01:20:00,963
I mean, this is New Orleans.

1177
01:20:01,047 --> 01:20:04,383
There’s never gonna be
a shortage of the down-and-out.

1178
01:20:05,176 --> 01:20:08,513
I have nothing but time.

1179
01:20:08,596 --> 01:20:11,098
You... No.

1180
01:20:11,182 --> 01:20:13,142
You could join me.

1181
01:20:15,061 --> 01:20:19,815
You could... you could
actually lead by my side.

1182
01:20:19,899 --> 01:20:23,861
Someone with your ability,

1183
01:20:23,945 --> 01:20:25,738
with your determination--

1184
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,658
you’d be a powerful vampire.

1185
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:31,994
Your skin.

1186
01:20:32,078 --> 01:20:35,164
You’d be day-walking
by tomorrow.

1187
01:20:35,248 --> 01:20:36,624
You...

1188
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:39,835
You could help.

1189
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:43,464
You could actually
right the wrongs

1190
01:20:43,548 --> 01:20:47,635
that gave your mother the
problems she had to deal with.

1191
01:20:50,471 --> 01:20:51,722
I’d rather die.

1192
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:57,436
-

1193
01:20:59,397 --> 01:21:01,148
-

1194
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:23,671
It tastes so much sweeter

1195
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:26,757
when it’s against your will.

1196
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:37,727
Eat this!

1197
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:39,478
-

1198
01:22:00,374 --> 01:22:01,959
This is for my mother.

1199
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:34,617
CHRIS:
Shawna.

1200
01:22:35,785 --> 01:22:37,244
No, no. Pedro, Pedro.

1201
01:22:37,328 --> 01:22:39,413
Pedro, Pedro, Pedro,
it’s gonna be okay.

1202
01:22:39,497 --> 01:22:41,666
Pedro, it’s gonna be okay.
Just c-come on.

1203
01:22:41,749 --> 01:22:43,876
Just stay with us.
Pedro, Pedro, stay with us.

1204
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:46,837
Pedro, no. No, Pedro, please!

1205
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:48,547
Please stay with us!

1206
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:50,675
Pedro, please stay.

1207
01:22:50,758 --> 01:22:52,343
Please stay!

1208
01:22:52,426 --> 01:22:54,762
Pedro, no.

1209
01:22:57,056 --> 01:23:00,685
No. Please!

1210
01:23:33,217 --> 01:23:34,885
SHAWNA: Remember what I said
about my world

1211
01:23:34,969 --> 01:23:36,679
getting messed up beyond belief?

1212
01:23:36,762 --> 01:23:39,473
Yeah, well, that doesn’t even
begin to cover it.

1213
01:23:39,557 --> 01:23:42,560
But Pedro always
used to say to me...

1214
01:23:42,643 --> 01:23:44,478
he’d say,

1215
01:23:44,562 --> 01:23:46,689
"Mami, hell no. I’ll call
the fashion police on you,

1216
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:49,692
and they gonna give you a
life sentence for that outfit."

1217
01:23:49,775 --> 01:23:51,444
You know what else he said,

1218
01:23:51,527 --> 01:23:53,446
like, when I would get sad
or whatever?

1219
01:23:54,864 --> 01:23:56,365
Nothing.

1220
01:23:56,449 --> 01:23:58,242
He didn’t have
some inspirational quote

1221
01:23:58,325 --> 01:23:59,702
to cheer me up.

1222
01:23:59,785 --> 01:24:02,163
He’d just crack a joke,
and next thing I know,

1223
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:05,124
we’d be laughing and smiling
and barely remembering

1224
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:08,669
what we were sad about
in the first place.

1225
01:24:08,753 --> 01:24:10,921
So that’s what I’m gonna do.

1226
01:24:11,005 --> 01:24:12,631
I’m gonna smile.

1227
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:18,304
So that was the summer

1228
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:21,557
I got breasts
and fought vampires.

1229
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:33,944
I lost my mother
and my best friend.

1230
01:24:35,446 --> 01:24:37,156
But I gained some people, too.

1231
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:42,119
Life at home with Jamal
had never been better.

1232
01:24:42,203 --> 01:24:44,038
You look pretty today, Shawn.

1233
01:24:44,121 --> 01:24:45,414
Just like Ma.

1234
01:24:46,665 --> 01:24:47,917
Thanks.

1235
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,544
Granya and I became
friends for life.

1236
01:24:50,628 --> 01:24:53,881
She even convinced me
to try goat yoga.

1237
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:56,634
Hey. Would you like
to sign our petition?

1238
01:24:56,717 --> 01:24:58,511
Babineaux was wrong
about a lot of things,

1239
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:01,138
-but some things are worth
fighting for. -Okay.

1240
01:25:01,222 --> 01:25:02,973
-For my family...
-Hello.

1241
01:25:03,057 --> 01:25:04,767
-...my community... -Would you
like to sign our petition?

1242
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:06,268
-...for myself.
-Cool. Okay.

1243
01:25:06,352 --> 01:25:09,188
-And of course, there was Chris.
-Sign right there.

1244
01:25:09,271 --> 01:25:10,689
Duh.

1245
01:25:12,358 --> 01:25:14,443
CHRIS:
A’ight, so I handed out

1246
01:25:14,527 --> 01:25:16,070
-a bunch of pamphlets.
-Mm-hmm.

1247
01:25:16,153 --> 01:25:18,364
-I’m gonna head out.
-You leaving?

1248
01:25:18,447 --> 01:25:20,950
I got to bring my brother
to this addiction meeting thing.

1249
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:22,451
I said I’d be there.

1250
01:25:22,535 --> 01:25:24,954
But you still want
to kick it tonight, right?

1251
01:25:25,037 --> 01:25:27,248
How about...

1252
01:25:27,331 --> 01:25:29,208
you go pick us up a pizza,

1253
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:31,126
and then we meet
back at my place?

1254
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:32,461
What about your pops?

1255
01:25:35,548 --> 01:25:37,466
As long as you leave
before morning.

1256
01:25:40,636 --> 01:25:42,555
Oh, Chris...

1257
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:45,015
extra garlic.

1258
01:25:51,063 --> 01:25:53,899
Jamal? You here?

1259
01:25:55,985 --> 01:25:59,488
Or do I have
the whole place to myself?

1260
01:26:01,407 --> 01:26:04,910
Including the bedroom?

1261
01:26:11,876 --> 01:26:13,919
Chris, did you remember the...

1262
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:16,589
PEDRO:
Hey, mami.
