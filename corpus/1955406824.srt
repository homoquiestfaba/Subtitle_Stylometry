1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,866
(deep swishing)

2
00:00:08,233 --> 00:00:10,983
(birds flapping)

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,330
(eerie dramatic music)

4
00:02:19,552 --> 00:02:22,219
(water gushing)

5
00:02:26,336 --> 00:02:29,086
(gears creaking)

6
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:34,639
- All right, you boys.

7
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,391
I know you're both new so this may seem

8
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:40,058
a bit strange and
unfamiliar to ya at first.

9
00:02:41,017 --> 00:02:43,342
Just gotta pace yourself, that's all.

10
00:02:43,342 --> 00:02:44,562
That's the key.

11
00:02:44,562 --> 00:02:46,592
Keep the sewage flowin'.

12
00:02:46,592 --> 00:02:47,974
That's the idea.

13
00:02:47,974 --> 00:02:49,744
Somethin' bad comes into the trap,

14
00:02:49,744 --> 00:02:51,498
it's our job to fish it out.

15
00:02:51,498 --> 00:02:54,383
Fish it out, dump it in the bins.

16
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:55,216
That's it.

17
00:02:56,706 --> 00:02:57,539
Basic.

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,500
- Hey, five bucks.

19
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:05,842
- Save it for your retirement.

20
00:03:05,842 --> 00:03:07,081
- Aw, that's nothin'.

21
00:03:07,081 --> 00:03:10,487
I once fished a kilo of
heroin out of the trap.

22
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:13,152
Turned it over to the police, of course.

23
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:15,652
Yeah, find all sorts of stuff.

24
00:03:17,057 --> 00:03:19,390
Diamond rings and necklaces.

25
00:03:21,331 --> 00:03:23,581
Wanna know a little secret?

26
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:27,263
My Lizzie's engagement ring?

27
00:03:27,263 --> 00:03:29,349
Got it right here.

28
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:30,182
Yes, sir.

29
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:35,402
(coughing)

30
00:03:35,402 --> 00:03:37,888
I once fished a woman's hand out

31
00:03:37,888 --> 00:03:40,240
with her fingerprints cut off.

32
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,768
And embryos.

33
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:42,979
- Embryos?

34
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:45,240
- [Man] You know, don't want it around.

35
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,142
Flush it down.

36
00:03:47,142 --> 00:03:48,263
- Bullshit.

37
00:03:48,263 --> 00:03:49,481
- Oh, we get 'em.

38
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:51,647
Four or five a year.

39
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:55,814
Sometimes like they ain't got
no arms and legs and shit.

40
00:03:57,774 --> 00:03:59,357
You know, deformed.

41
00:04:00,518 --> 00:04:03,903
Sometimes we get things don't rightly know

42
00:04:03,903 --> 00:04:05,820
what the hell they are.

43
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:10,216
I reckon I've seen just about everything

44
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:13,049
that can come out of a sewer pipe.

45
00:04:15,012 --> 00:04:15,845
Aw.

46
00:04:17,302 --> 00:04:18,135
- What?

47
00:04:18,135 --> 00:04:20,238
What the hell is this?

48
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,988
(dramatic music)

49
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:27,579
- [Man] Come on, Martin.

50
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:28,412
What is it?

51
00:04:28,412 --> 00:04:30,657
- Eh, it's just one of them thangs.

52
00:04:30,657 --> 00:04:31,657
- Holy shit.

53
00:04:32,688 --> 00:04:33,521
- Man.

54
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,263
(flesh squishing)

55
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:46,178
- [Man] So what is it?

56
00:04:46,178 --> 00:04:47,429
- Well, like I said.

57
00:04:47,429 --> 00:04:49,679
It's a, one of them thangs.

58
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:53,008
- What do we do with it?

59
00:04:53,008 --> 00:04:54,307
- I'll take care of it.

60
00:04:54,307 --> 00:04:56,867
That's my responsibility
as head of the shift,

61
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:58,773
so you two can relax.

62
00:04:58,773 --> 00:05:01,273
Everything's under my control.

63
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:07,005
(suspenseful music)

64
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,202
- Well, that's the whole point, George.

65
00:06:02,202 --> 00:06:03,521
I knew you had bicephalic fetus.

66
00:06:03,521 --> 00:06:04,904
I sold it to you.

67
00:06:04,904 --> 00:06:07,536
That's why I know that
two-headed darling's a boy.

68
00:06:07,536 --> 00:06:08,750
This one I got now is a girl.

69
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,659
You'll have a matched set.

70
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:13,576
(muffled speaking)

71
00:06:15,354 --> 00:06:16,741
Well now I think we're
talking somewhere along

72
00:06:16,741 --> 00:06:20,552
the lines of $12,500
dollars with free delivery.

73
00:06:20,552 --> 00:06:23,160
(muffled speaking)

74
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,586
Yes, George.

75
00:06:24,586 --> 00:06:27,216
(muffled speaking)

76
00:06:27,216 --> 00:06:28,829
Honey, honey, I know the two-headed babies

77
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:30,534
ain't as rare as they once were,

78
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:34,166
but you can't exactly pick
one up at Sears, now can you?

79
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,138
(sipping)

80
00:06:37,138 --> 00:06:39,805
(phone ringing)

81
00:06:41,996 --> 00:06:43,820
- International Medical Specimens, Inc.

82
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,539
Elvina speaking.

83
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,664
(muffles speaking)

84
00:06:46,664 --> 00:06:47,497
Uh-huh.

85
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:50,461
Uh-huh.

86
00:06:50,461 --> 00:06:51,316
Okay, now.

87
00:06:51,316 --> 00:06:52,149
Hold on.

88
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:54,566
I'll see if Ms. Yost is free.

89
00:07:06,775 --> 00:07:08,942
(beeping)

90
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:14,458
(muffled speaking)

91
00:07:15,425 --> 00:07:17,592
(beeping)

92
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,367
(sighing)

93
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:25,174
Hi, hello?

94
00:07:25,174 --> 00:07:29,341
Um, Ms. Yost, she's like on
another call sort of thing.

95
00:07:31,321 --> 00:07:32,862
Do you think you can hold?

96
00:07:32,862 --> 00:07:34,945
- Yeah, yeah, I can hold.

97
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:38,216
- [Elvina] Okay, sweetie.

98
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:46,598
- Honey, honey I gotta tell you.

99
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:49,350
When I first looked into
those two pairs of baby blues

100
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,341
peeking out at me from that
bottle of denatured alcohol,

101
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:54,514
I thought of you.

102
00:07:54,514 --> 00:07:55,732
But you know, your Belinda doesn't believe

103
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:56,565
in the hard sell.

104
00:07:56,565 --> 00:07:57,398
I mean, you ain't interested.

105
00:07:57,398 --> 00:07:58,306
I pick up the phone,

106
00:07:58,306 --> 00:07:59,381
this little two-headed angel's gonna be

107
00:07:59,381 --> 00:08:00,963
flying to somebody else.

108
00:08:00,963 --> 00:08:02,117
- [George] All right, fine, fine.

109
00:08:02,117 --> 00:08:03,382
All right, so what should I do?

110
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:04,583
What do you want me to do?

111
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,881
Come down there with the cash?

112
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:07,262
- Georgy boy.

113
00:08:07,262 --> 00:08:10,238
This is a no deposit, no
return kind of business.

114
00:08:10,238 --> 00:08:11,715
Want to come on down, take a look?

115
00:08:11,715 --> 00:08:14,105
- [George] Yeah (muffled speech).

116
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:15,874
- That's fine.

117
00:08:15,874 --> 00:08:17,683
You like the little angel,
you give me a certified check.

118
00:08:17,683 --> 00:08:18,921
Cash and carry.

119
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:20,409
(muffled speaking)

120
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:23,635
Well, I look forward to seeing you, too.

121
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:24,946
Right.

122
00:08:24,946 --> 00:08:26,702
- [George] All right, have fun.

123
00:08:26,702 --> 00:08:28,240
- Yes, baby, you got it.

124
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,752
You are so good.

125
00:08:29,752 --> 00:08:32,002
(laughing)

126
00:08:35,527 --> 00:08:39,450
Elvina, was that guy from
the sewer still on hold?

127
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,903
- Ah, well, he's still on the line,

128
00:08:40,903 --> 00:08:42,320
but I can't, um--

129
00:08:43,609 --> 00:08:44,608
- [Ms. Yost] Fine, fine, fine.

130
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:45,763
- I think the hold thing ain't workin'.

131
00:08:45,763 --> 00:08:46,763
- Nevermind.

132
00:08:49,546 --> 00:08:50,882
Martin, angel.

133
00:08:50,882 --> 00:08:52,233
Long time no hear.

134
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:53,663
Where have you been hiding yourself?

135
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:55,667
- [Martin] Well, you know,
I've been working in the sewer.

136
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:56,629
- Uh-huh.

137
00:08:56,629 --> 00:08:58,485
- [Martin] But I found this
thing and I'm interested in it.

138
00:08:58,485 --> 00:08:59,444
It's kind of like--

139
00:08:59,444 --> 00:09:00,277
- Mmm-hmm.

140
00:09:00,277 --> 00:09:02,446
- [Martin] It's got two eyes, two mouths.

141
00:09:02,446 --> 00:09:03,468
- Say that again.

142
00:09:03,468 --> 00:09:05,681
- [Martin] It's got two
mouths, two ears, two eyes.

143
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:06,514
- [Ms. Yost] No, no, no.

144
00:09:06,514 --> 00:09:08,456
Just describe it.

145
00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:11,252
(muffled speaking)

146
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:12,263
Yeah.

147
00:09:12,263 --> 00:09:14,558
- [Martin] It's got two heads.

148
00:09:14,558 --> 00:09:15,690
Yeah.

149
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,608
(muffled speaking)

150
00:09:17,608 --> 00:09:19,191
I'll be right down.

151
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:25,899
Elvina, call Mr. Lazar.

152
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,870
Tell him may have something
really hot coming in.

153
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,000
Tell him to meet me
down in cold storage in,

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,814
oh shoot, an hour.

155
00:09:32,814 --> 00:09:34,299
- Well, what about Dr. Lorca?

156
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:35,987
I mean, I've got, I mean I
thought we was supposed to--

157
00:09:35,987 --> 00:09:37,441
- Honey, if I wanted a
thinking receptionist

158
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:39,356
you'd be working at Burger King, okay?

159
00:09:39,356 --> 00:09:41,743
Now pick up the phone and call Mr. Lazar.

160
00:09:41,743 --> 00:09:42,865
I've gotta run.

161
00:09:42,865 --> 00:09:44,220
- Well, can I take...

162
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,053
(door slamming)

163
00:09:45,053 --> 00:09:46,469
lunch?

164
00:09:46,469 --> 00:09:48,636
(sighing)

165
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:58,268
(phone beeping)

166
00:10:01,673 --> 00:10:03,090
Hello? Dr. Lorca?

167
00:10:04,023 --> 00:10:06,217
Um, this is Elvina Shaw from--

168
00:10:06,217 --> 00:10:07,903
- [Dr. Lorca] How are you?

169
00:10:07,903 --> 00:10:12,066
- Well, you know, you know how
you told me to call you if--

170
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:14,225
(muffled speaking)

171
00:10:14,225 --> 00:10:15,475
Why yes she is.

172
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,273
Just like you suspected, I bet.

173
00:10:20,402 --> 00:10:21,902
Uh-huh, Mr. Lazar.

174
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:24,782
That's right.

175
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:27,132
Uh-huh.

176
00:10:28,764 --> 00:10:29,597
Sure, sure.

177
00:10:29,597 --> 00:10:31,644
As soon as I find somethin' out.

178
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:32,477
Uh-huh.

179
00:10:33,776 --> 00:10:35,109
Well, thank you.

180
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:46,378
- Sheila, this world is
full of dishonest people.

181
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:47,750
- Due tell, Doc.

182
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,831
- I have paid this
woman, this Belinda Yost,

183
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:51,998
a costly retainer for years to guarantee

184
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:53,610
that I will have the first opportunity

185
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,301
to buy her unusual specimens.

186
00:10:56,301 --> 00:10:57,199
- Don't have to tell me.

187
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:58,259
I write the checks.

188
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:01,221
- And now she has gone behind my back.

189
00:11:01,221 --> 00:11:03,373
And to whom do you think?

190
00:11:03,373 --> 00:11:04,260
- Smithsonian?

191
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,863
- Oh-ho, that would be bad enough.

192
00:11:05,863 --> 00:11:09,464
But she's sneaking behind
my back with that gauche,

193
00:11:09,464 --> 00:11:11,858
undiscriminating collector
of medical garbage.

194
00:11:11,858 --> 00:11:13,747
Napoleon Lazar.

195
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:16,669
How can I continue to do business
with this dishonest woman?

196
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:18,919
- Doc, you want my opinion?

197
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:20,956
- Perhaps.

198
00:11:20,956 --> 00:11:23,937
- You say the world is
full of dishonest people.

199
00:11:23,937 --> 00:11:27,104
I say if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

200
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,200
- [Man] So, has Ms.
Yost said anything more

201
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,011
about the specimens?

202
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:39,678
- [Elvina] Um, nope.

203
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:42,295
- [Man] Nope.

204
00:11:42,295 --> 00:11:43,128
Ah, well.

205
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,176
Well, Ms. Yost.

206
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:53,639
- The, the Napoleon.

207
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:55,454
Just hold on one sec and I
want to show you something

208
00:11:55,454 --> 00:11:57,383
that'll knock your socks off.

209
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,552
- When I leave in the
middle of a board meeting,

210
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,630
I expect to have my socks knocked.

211
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,280
- Have I ever disappointed you?

212
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,448
- Occasionally.

213
00:12:05,448 --> 00:12:07,948
- Oh, now, don't be like that.

214
00:12:09,744 --> 00:12:12,994
Well, Marty boy, have I made you happy?

215
00:12:15,563 --> 00:12:17,571
- You sure have.

216
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,846
If I find anything else--

217
00:12:18,846 --> 00:12:20,837
- You just give me a call.

218
00:12:20,837 --> 00:12:23,700
Elvina, why don't you show Martin on out.

219
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,117
- Um, yeah, sure.

220
00:12:27,428 --> 00:12:28,747
Come on.

221
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:31,830
- And close the door on your way out.

222
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,948
Sir, you're about to spend
a huge quantity of money.

223
00:12:37,948 --> 00:12:40,118
- Well, it's always good
to know these things.

224
00:12:40,118 --> 00:12:42,318
- In fact, I'm gonna tell you
exactly what you're gonna do.

225
00:12:42,318 --> 00:12:43,835
In about 60 seconds you're gonna pick up

226
00:12:43,835 --> 00:12:46,172
your portable phone and
you're gonna call someone,

227
00:12:46,172 --> 00:12:47,787
and you're gonna have them deliver to me

228
00:12:47,787 --> 00:12:51,103
a certified check for $650,000 dollars.

229
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,413
- How eccentric of me.

230
00:12:52,413 --> 00:12:54,210
- In addition, you're
gonna sign some documents

231
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,613
I got tucked in here somewhere.

232
00:12:57,613 --> 00:13:00,049
Said documents constituting
a guarantee to purchase

233
00:13:00,049 --> 00:13:03,451
no less than $250,000
dollars of medical specimens

234
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:06,686
from me per year for the next 10 years.

235
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:08,436
- How generous of me.

236
00:13:09,365 --> 00:13:11,101
I give you a check,

237
00:13:11,101 --> 00:13:13,463
I agree to purchase a
quarter of a million dollars

238
00:13:13,463 --> 00:13:16,031
of your medical leftovers?

239
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:17,882
- Per year for the next 10 years.

240
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:20,202
- Per year for the next 10 years.

241
00:13:20,202 --> 00:13:21,990
(laughing)

242
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,990
My goodness.

243
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,961
Whatever has come over me?

244
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:28,369
- Napoleon, you're sweet,

245
00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:29,824
but I can see right through you into

246
00:13:29,824 --> 00:13:32,698
the other side, my friend.

247
00:13:32,698 --> 00:13:35,480
I got three drunks, two
junkies, and six fat people

248
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,614
in my immediate family alone.

249
00:13:37,614 --> 00:13:39,082
I know when someone's hooked on something.

250
00:13:39,082 --> 00:13:40,773
I know all the signs.

251
00:13:40,773 --> 00:13:43,953
I just name my price
and I won't negotiate.

252
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:45,252
If the air's too thin for you,

253
00:13:45,252 --> 00:13:48,087
then there's no reason
for me to open this box.

254
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:50,988
I won't get more from
anybody else, I know that.

255
00:13:50,988 --> 00:13:53,134
But this is what I want.

256
00:13:53,134 --> 00:13:55,016
And if you won't give it to me,

257
00:13:55,016 --> 00:13:57,720
then I'll take less from Lorca.

258
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,648
- Don't mention that medical fraud,

259
00:13:59,648 --> 00:14:02,761
that cadaverous Castilian dilettante.

260
00:14:02,761 --> 00:14:05,979
- Honey, you're either in
the game or you're not.

261
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,229
- Open the box.

262
00:14:12,497 --> 00:14:15,247
(dramatic music)

263
00:14:24,178 --> 00:14:25,011
May I?

264
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:26,781
- Please.

265
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,536
It's real, all right.

266
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,698
Don't think I would've
bought it otherwise.

267
00:14:32,698 --> 00:14:34,948
It ain't no Piltdown, baby.

268
00:14:36,982 --> 00:14:39,732
(dramatic music)

269
00:14:44,602 --> 00:14:47,747
(phone dialing)

270
00:14:47,747 --> 00:14:49,747
- Alfonse, a 10, please.

271
00:14:50,595 --> 00:14:54,108
You are to go to Mr.
Willitson at our special bank.

272
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:56,253
You are to have him
draft a certified check

273
00:14:56,253 --> 00:15:00,420
for $650,000 dollars made
out to Ms. Belinda Yost.

274
00:15:01,576 --> 00:15:03,365
- That's right.

275
00:15:03,365 --> 00:15:04,365
- Repeat please.

276
00:15:04,365 --> 00:15:06,646
- [Alfonse] Ah, $650,000
dollars to Belinda Yost.

277
00:15:06,646 --> 00:15:08,176
- That is correct.

278
00:15:08,176 --> 00:15:11,031
You are then to hand carry
that check to me here

279
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:13,813
at International Medical Specimens.

280
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:14,842
Estimated time, please?

281
00:15:14,842 --> 00:15:16,818
- Make it snappy, nappy.

282
00:15:16,818 --> 00:15:18,703
- [Alfonse] I think about two hours.

283
00:15:18,703 --> 00:15:19,585
- Thank you.

284
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,594
That will be acceptable.

285
00:15:21,594 --> 00:15:23,844
And Alfonse, don't be late.

286
00:15:27,641 --> 00:15:29,706
You'll have your check within two hours.

287
00:15:29,706 --> 00:15:34,157
- Honey, you just made
me a very happy girl.

288
00:15:34,157 --> 00:15:36,157
- The documents, please.

289
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,100
(suspenseful music)

290
00:16:06,835 --> 00:16:08,861
- [Sheila] Yeah, Doc?

291
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:11,765
- The little pigeon is on his way.

292
00:16:11,765 --> 00:16:12,848
- [Woman] Roger Wilco.

293
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:13,931
Over and out.

294
00:16:15,272 --> 00:16:18,272
(suspenseful music)

295
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,403
- What? What?

296
00:16:42,982 --> 00:16:44,982
This is my private road.

297
00:16:46,561 --> 00:16:47,394
Oh.

298
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:52,469
Yes, yes.

299
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,721
Are you alive?

300
00:16:57,721 --> 00:16:59,290
Hmm?

301
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,087
You know, you shouldn't be here.

302
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,688
Hey, you.

303
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,021
- Don't move, little froggy.

304
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,401
- Ah, what is this?

305
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:09,449
- It ain't Candid Camera.

306
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:10,616
Open the door.

307
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,271
You try anything funny,

308
00:17:15,271 --> 00:17:16,626
I'll fill you with so
many holes people will be

309
00:17:16,626 --> 00:17:17,884
able to read through ya.

310
00:17:17,884 --> 00:17:20,481
- My wallet is in my inside pocket.

311
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:21,691
- Move.

312
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:22,524
Shut up.

313
00:17:22,524 --> 00:17:24,111
Up against that tree.

314
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:26,012
- [Napoleon] Just what
do you plan on doing?

315
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:27,485
- [Sheila] Not answering stupid questions.

316
00:17:27,485 --> 00:17:28,318
Move!

317
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:33,428
- [Mr. Lazar] Hey, what are you doing

318
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:34,348
walking around like that?

319
00:17:34,348 --> 00:17:35,466
With no top on?

320
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:36,299
- I'm free.

321
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:37,231
I'm proud.

322
00:17:37,231 --> 00:17:38,064
I'm woman.

323
00:17:39,177 --> 00:17:42,177
Now wrap your arms around that tree.

324
00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:51,938
- You realize, of course, you're
gonna go to jail for this.

325
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:52,810
- I know.

326
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,195
That's why I keep comin'
back to a life of crime.

327
00:17:55,195 --> 00:17:56,898
It's 'cause I like being in jail.

328
00:17:56,898 --> 00:17:58,354
Trouble is they keep letting me out.

329
00:17:58,354 --> 00:18:01,014
Think I'd get a longer
sentence with murder?

330
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:02,501
- How amusing.

331
00:18:02,501 --> 00:18:04,557
- I happen to have an
excellent sense of humor.

332
00:18:04,557 --> 00:18:05,974
Sit tight for me.

333
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:24,610
- Wait, there's nothing of value in there.

334
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,443
- Where you goin'?

335
00:18:25,443 --> 00:18:26,704
The beach?

336
00:18:26,704 --> 00:18:29,541
- It's um, it's a biological specimen.

337
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,291
It's, it's dangerous, contagious.

338
00:18:33,427 --> 00:18:34,844
- Wow, it's cool.

339
00:18:35,771 --> 00:18:38,458
Bet this'll be a real
ice breaker at parties.

340
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,570
- No, no, no, wait.

341
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,403
You can take anything else.

342
00:18:40,403 --> 00:18:41,823
Take the car.

343
00:18:41,823 --> 00:18:43,589
- [Sheila] I already got a car.

344
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:44,851
- [Napoleon] Listen, listen.

345
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:47,279
I'll give you more money.

346
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:48,567
- [Sheila] What are you gonna do?

347
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:50,070
Write me a check?

348
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,895
See you around, froggy.

349
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:53,158
- No, no, no, wait.

350
00:18:53,158 --> 00:18:54,639
Come back, please.

351
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:55,472
Please.

352
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,728
Come back, you thief.

353
00:18:58,728 --> 00:19:00,240
Please.

354
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,741
You ho.

355
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,094
I'll kill you.

356
00:19:03,094 --> 00:19:04,476
I'll kill you!

357
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,309
Come back!

358
00:19:06,163 --> 00:19:06,996
Come back!

359
00:19:11,122 --> 00:19:14,372
(dramatic organ music)

360
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:06,354
- It's magnificent.

361
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,666
- I've never seen anything like it.

362
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,141
- No one has.

363
00:20:11,141 --> 00:20:14,663
There never has been anything like this.

364
00:20:14,663 --> 00:20:15,496
Never.

365
00:20:16,814 --> 00:20:20,981
It's, it's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

366
00:20:23,572 --> 00:20:25,824
Quickly, one of the large jars.

367
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:26,657
- Can do.

368
00:20:33,036 --> 00:20:35,786
(dramatic music)

369
00:21:01,782 --> 00:21:04,833
- There you are, my treasure.

370
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,666
This is your new home.

371
00:21:07,728 --> 00:21:10,728
Here you will be appreciated, loved.

372
00:21:18,088 --> 00:21:20,755
(kiss smacking)

373
00:21:22,787 --> 00:21:26,367
- Doc, you two want to be left alone?

374
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:28,534
- Yes, yes, I think we do.

375
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,481
I won't be having dinner tonight, I think.

376
00:21:37,481 --> 00:21:39,261
- Well, I will.

377
00:21:39,261 --> 00:21:40,623
See you later, Doc.

378
00:21:40,623 --> 00:21:41,456
- Sheila?

379
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:46,147
Don't forget the preservative.

380
00:21:46,147 --> 00:21:47,155
- Can do.

381
00:21:47,155 --> 00:21:51,175
- And Sheila, thank you so much for this.

382
00:21:51,175 --> 00:21:52,872
- My pleasure, Doc.

383
00:21:52,872 --> 00:21:55,681
I always knew I'd make
a great highway robber.

384
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,764
I'm going to go take care of the car.

385
00:22:01,512 --> 00:22:04,762
(eerie dramatic music)

386
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:01,650
- [Recording] Warning.

387
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,600
Acid bath.

388
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,897
Please stand clear.

389
00:23:03,897 --> 00:23:05,647
Three, two, one, bye.

390
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,363
(liquid bubbling)

391
00:23:22,078 --> 00:23:25,328
(eerie dramatic music)

392
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:11,911
- Right, okay.

393
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:15,185
Let me just see if I can get
this straight in my head.

394
00:25:15,185 --> 00:25:18,743
There were these guys who
sell freaks in bottles,

395
00:25:18,743 --> 00:25:22,843
and you're like this Class A, 
big time freak collector.

396
00:25:22,843 --> 00:25:24,770
- Biological oddities.

397
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:25,983
- Right.

398
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:28,747
And like your job is sellin'
the freaks in the bottles

399
00:25:28,747 --> 00:25:29,987
that this guy buys.

400
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,036
- That's right.

401
00:25:31,036 --> 00:25:33,561
- You're like the chief freak broker

402
00:25:33,561 --> 00:25:35,588
in this freak collecting underground.

403
00:25:35,588 --> 00:25:37,181
- Remember the skeleton
of the Elephant Man?

404
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:39,212
Michael Jackson wanted to buy it?

405
00:25:39,212 --> 00:25:40,342
- He didn't get it.

406
00:25:40,342 --> 00:25:41,744
- He didn't come to me.

407
00:25:41,744 --> 00:25:43,236
- Yeah.

408
00:25:43,236 --> 00:25:46,178
Now my problem is you
sell this really hot shit

409
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:49,115
freak to him for some undisclosed sum,

410
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:51,964
and somebody rips it off at gunpoint.

411
00:25:51,964 --> 00:25:55,494
- And keeps me handcuffed to
a tree for the next 14 hours.

412
00:25:55,494 --> 00:25:58,609
- So why don't you go the police?

413
00:25:58,609 --> 00:25:59,442
- Well.

414
00:25:59,442 --> 00:26:00,638
- The thing is, Mr. Kantor,

415
00:26:00,638 --> 00:26:04,434
although what we do is
not considered illegal,

416
00:26:04,434 --> 00:26:06,934
it has a, oh, what's the word?

417
00:26:07,903 --> 00:26:08,736
- Creepy?

418
00:26:08,736 --> 00:26:10,674
- Unsavory reputation.

419
00:26:10,674 --> 00:26:14,197
The legal situation is,
oh, a rather gray area.

420
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,846
- And we want to keep it gray.

421
00:26:15,846 --> 00:26:18,064
That's no police.

422
00:26:18,064 --> 00:26:19,644
We know where my specimen is.

423
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:20,484
- We can't be sure.

424
00:26:20,484 --> 00:26:21,706
- Oh, I can be sure.

425
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:23,578
It was stolen by one of the most depraved,

426
00:26:23,578 --> 00:26:27,230
immoral and covetous creatures
on the face of the earth.

427
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,250
Dr. Emilio Lorca.

428
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,628
- I take it he has an
interest in this stuff?

429
00:26:33,628 --> 00:26:35,612
- I'm a serious collector.

430
00:26:35,612 --> 00:26:38,112
Lorca is a dabbler, a dilettante.

431
00:26:38,112 --> 00:26:42,812
- So how did this Lorca guy
know that you had this goober?

432
00:26:42,812 --> 00:26:44,027
- I would very much
like to know the answer

433
00:26:44,027 --> 00:26:46,137
to that question myself.

434
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:47,903
- [Mr. Kantor] Could your
phone in your office be bugged?

435
00:26:47,903 --> 00:26:50,230
- I check my offices bi-monthly.

436
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,011
This is a business that
requires discretion,

437
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:54,551
and the last time was only two days ago.

438
00:26:54,551 --> 00:26:55,699
- Your receptionist?

439
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:59,473
- My receptionist is a performing
chimp in human disguise.

440
00:26:59,473 --> 00:27:02,105
She's too stupid to be dishonest.

441
00:27:02,105 --> 00:27:06,577
- Ms. Yost, I have yet to
meet a person that's stupid.

442
00:27:06,577 --> 00:27:09,169
Is she the cupcake out
in the waiting room?

443
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,926
- Yeah, she's the cupcake.

444
00:27:10,926 --> 00:27:12,504
Elvina.

445
00:27:12,504 --> 00:27:13,671
- Send her in.

446
00:27:15,627 --> 00:27:16,544
Hi, Elvina.

447
00:27:17,401 --> 00:27:18,401
- Hi, there.

448
00:27:19,243 --> 00:27:21,017
- You know what's goin' on here?

449
00:27:21,017 --> 00:27:21,934
- Um, well.

450
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,317
- Take your time.

451
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:31,191
- Ye, yeah.

452
00:27:33,316 --> 00:27:34,566
- Yeah, you do.

453
00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:37,709
(laughing)

454
00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:38,852
- Yeah.

455
00:27:38,852 --> 00:27:39,749
- Okay, now.

456
00:27:39,749 --> 00:27:41,704
Listen carefully.

457
00:27:41,704 --> 00:27:45,059
Dr. Lorca, he was arrested earlier today.

458
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:46,404
He told the police that
you helped him steal

459
00:27:46,404 --> 00:27:48,656
the freak from Mr. Lazar here.

460
00:27:48,656 --> 00:27:49,954
- That fucker!

461
00:27:49,954 --> 00:27:51,763
- He told the police that you were the one

462
00:27:51,763 --> 00:27:54,135
who actually stuck the
gun in Mr. Lazar's face

463
00:27:54,135 --> 00:27:57,059
and left him handcuffed to a tree.

464
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:58,276
- Nuh-uh.

465
00:27:58,276 --> 00:27:59,109
Not me.

466
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:00,609
All I did was I...

467
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:06,020
- He said the whole thing was your idea.

468
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,603
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

469
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:11,098
Oh, God. Oh, God.

470
00:28:11,098 --> 00:28:13,503
- I'm sorry, baby, but it
looks like jail for you.

471
00:28:13,503 --> 00:28:14,518
Doc's a respected man.

472
00:28:14,518 --> 00:28:15,435
You're not.

473
00:28:17,084 --> 00:28:19,094
He's cuttin' a deal right now.

474
00:28:19,094 --> 00:28:20,513
You know, it would go a lot
easier for you with the judge

475
00:28:20,513 --> 00:28:22,526
if you'd just confess.

476
00:28:22,526 --> 00:28:24,732
- No, no I swear on my honor.

477
00:28:24,732 --> 00:28:26,094
Cross my heart, hope to die.

478
00:28:26,094 --> 00:28:29,488
All I did was just tell
him about the specimen.

479
00:28:29,488 --> 00:28:31,138
I didn't know nothin' else.

480
00:28:31,138 --> 00:28:33,335
- And I put up with your
typing for three years

481
00:28:33,335 --> 00:28:34,545
'cause I thought you were too stupid to

482
00:28:34,545 --> 00:28:36,319
stab me in the back.

483
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,393
You're fired.

484
00:28:37,393 --> 00:28:38,393
You're fired from everywhere.

485
00:28:38,393 --> 00:28:40,982
You're fired from the fucking universe.

486
00:28:40,982 --> 00:28:41,815
- Huh?

487
00:28:44,691 --> 00:28:47,888
- The police don't know
anything about Dr. Lorca.

488
00:28:47,888 --> 00:28:49,055
I lied to you.

489
00:28:52,005 --> 00:28:53,405
- Yeah?

490
00:28:53,405 --> 00:28:55,655
(laughing)

491
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,713
Yeah!

492
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:02,350
Well, well, I lied to you, too.

493
00:29:03,376 --> 00:29:04,209
(slap smacking)

494
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,042
Ow!

495
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:06,497
- You ungrateful little poodle dog.

496
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:07,963
- Well, it was all your fault.

497
00:29:07,963 --> 00:29:09,540
You broke your word to Dr. Lorca.

498
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,624
He was supposed to have first dibs.

499
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:12,589
- And what are you?

500
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:14,381
Defender of the fucking public morals?

501
00:29:14,381 --> 00:29:17,464
- Oh, you're an evil, corrupt person.

502
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:21,131
She takes drugs.

503
00:29:21,131 --> 00:29:23,646
She doesn't wear any panties.

504
00:29:23,646 --> 00:29:26,705
She, she, she has sex in her
office with all these men

505
00:29:26,705 --> 00:29:28,060
all on her desk.

506
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,783
- You ungrateful little poodle dog!

507
00:29:29,783 --> 00:29:30,616
(screaming)

508
00:29:30,616 --> 00:29:31,449
- [Mr. Kantor] Ladies, ladies.

509
00:29:31,449 --> 00:29:32,282
- [Elvina] Oh, get off of me!

510
00:29:32,282 --> 00:29:33,115
- Ladies.

511
00:29:33,115 --> 00:29:33,948
Ah!

512
00:29:33,948 --> 00:29:34,781
- Fucking ladies, knock it off!

513
00:29:34,781 --> 00:29:35,679
Knock it off!

514
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,014
(screaming)

515
00:29:38,014 --> 00:29:40,135
Ms. Yost, hey, Ms. Yost.

516
00:29:40,135 --> 00:29:42,121
Normally I'm all in for a good cat fight,

517
00:29:42,121 --> 00:29:43,861
but seeing how's you are
paying me $160 dollars

518
00:29:43,861 --> 00:29:45,354
an hour for my time,

519
00:29:45,354 --> 00:29:46,448
you might want to
consider calling this one

520
00:29:46,448 --> 00:29:48,198
a draw for right now.

521
00:29:49,547 --> 00:29:52,645
- [Elvina] Well, I think
I'm gonna leave now.

522
00:29:52,645 --> 00:29:56,062
- No, actually I think you're gonna stay.

523
00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:59,726
'Cause even though they
haven't caught Dr. Lorca yet,

524
00:29:59,726 --> 00:30:01,382
it's still a possibility.

525
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:05,382
And that makes you an
accessory before the fact.

526
00:30:06,282 --> 00:30:07,141
- I'm a what?

527
00:30:07,141 --> 00:30:08,670
- It means when you called Dr. Lorca

528
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,648
and told him about the goober,

529
00:30:10,648 --> 00:30:15,061
you helped him to steal
it in the eyes of the law.

530
00:30:15,061 --> 00:30:16,145
- Nuh-uh.

531
00:30:16,145 --> 00:30:17,773
- No, uh-huh.

532
00:30:17,773 --> 00:30:19,115
So if you want to stay out of the clutches

533
00:30:19,115 --> 00:30:21,246
of the highly immoral and sexually diverse

534
00:30:21,246 --> 00:30:22,888
females at county jail,

535
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:25,456
your full-time job from now until I say so

536
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:28,550
is getting back the aforementioned freak.

537
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,524
You understand?

538
00:30:29,524 --> 00:30:31,191
(whimpering)

539
00:30:31,191 --> 00:30:34,336
Look, do what I say, you stay out of jail.

540
00:30:34,336 --> 00:30:35,169
Got it?

541
00:30:36,636 --> 00:30:38,279
- Yeah.

542
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:39,446
- So, you see?

543
00:30:40,537 --> 00:30:43,811
My suspicions were firmly grounded.

544
00:30:43,811 --> 00:30:46,370
That intellectual fraud Lorca is probably

545
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:49,149
pawing my specimens right now with his

546
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:50,982
thick, clumsy fingers.

547
00:30:53,683 --> 00:30:56,850
Touching it, probing it, violating it.

548
00:31:02,878 --> 00:31:05,901
Inserting instruments
into the most private--

549
00:31:05,901 --> 00:31:08,358
- We get the idea, nappy.

550
00:31:08,358 --> 00:31:09,525
So what do we do now?

551
00:31:09,525 --> 00:31:10,535
- Simple.

552
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,176
You call up Dr. Lorca
and you tell him you need

553
00:31:12,176 --> 00:31:13,976
to talk to him about a new specimen.

554
00:31:13,976 --> 00:31:15,542
Something he's sure to be interested in.

555
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:18,629
But you need to come over
and see him in person.

556
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:21,197
Now you don't want to let
on that you suspect him.

557
00:31:21,197 --> 00:31:23,737
He'll even know that Mr.
Lazar here got robbed.

558
00:31:23,737 --> 00:31:25,339
Make it convincing.

559
00:31:25,339 --> 00:31:27,261
Make him want to invite you over.

560
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:29,066
- That'll be as hard as
force-feeding chocolate cake

561
00:31:29,066 --> 00:31:30,094
to a fat boy.

562
00:31:30,094 --> 00:31:30,976
Then what?

563
00:31:30,976 --> 00:31:32,598
- All four of us take a
little ride over to Lorca's

564
00:31:32,598 --> 00:31:34,681
and get back your goober.

565
00:31:39,866 --> 00:31:41,687
- Aren't you glad you
installed the closed-circuit

566
00:31:41,687 --> 00:31:43,775
camera like I told you?

567
00:31:43,775 --> 00:31:47,214
- Yes, you're very clever, indeed.

568
00:31:47,214 --> 00:31:48,642
You see?

569
00:31:48,642 --> 00:31:50,763
Lazar is with him, as you expected.

570
00:31:50,763 --> 00:31:52,846
But who is the other man?

571
00:31:55,465 --> 00:31:57,214
- [Sheila] Muscle, I'll bet.

572
00:31:57,214 --> 00:31:58,894
Should I tell them to get lost?

573
00:31:58,894 --> 00:32:02,394
- No, that might drive them to the police.

574
00:32:04,107 --> 00:32:05,893
They have no proof.

575
00:32:05,893 --> 00:32:08,359
I'll see them in the parlor.

576
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,692
Everything is under control.

577
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:14,697
(dramatic music)

578
00:32:28,401 --> 00:32:31,151
(glass breaking)

579
00:32:42,918 --> 00:32:45,333
- [Mr. Kantor] It's quite a
little castle you got here, Doc.

580
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:48,432
- [Mr. Lorca] Yes, it
originally stood on the Rhine.

581
00:32:48,432 --> 00:32:50,689
I had it torn down and reassembled here

582
00:32:50,689 --> 00:32:52,772
with modern conveniences.

583
00:32:53,842 --> 00:32:55,955
- [Mr. Kantor] What do you
keep in all these rooms?

584
00:32:55,955 --> 00:32:56,931
- [Ms. Yost] Maybe we
should take a little tour

585
00:32:56,931 --> 00:32:57,933
of your castle.

586
00:32:57,933 --> 00:32:58,835
- [Mr. Lorca] Really?

587
00:32:58,835 --> 00:33:01,104
With or without my permission?

588
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,570
- [Mr. Kantor] Ah, come on, Doc.

589
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:05,212
You're too smart to play dumb.

590
00:33:05,212 --> 00:33:07,417
You see the cast of characters here.

591
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:08,678
You know what's goin' on.

592
00:33:08,678 --> 00:33:09,597
- Of course.

593
00:33:09,597 --> 00:33:12,089
I admit, I spoke to your receptionist.

594
00:33:12,089 --> 00:33:14,334
You and I had an arrangement, Ms. Yost.

595
00:33:14,334 --> 00:33:16,071
I had the right to assure myself that that

596
00:33:16,071 --> 00:33:18,173
arrangement was being honored,

597
00:33:18,173 --> 00:33:19,658
which it was not.

598
00:33:19,658 --> 00:33:23,670
- Did you have the right to
send your vixen to waylay me?

599
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:27,314
- I never saw you before
in my life, froggy.

600
00:33:27,314 --> 00:33:28,147
- Slut.

601
00:33:29,101 --> 00:33:30,351
You cheap slut.

602
00:33:31,362 --> 00:33:33,913
- Hey, now slut I don't mind.

603
00:33:33,913 --> 00:33:35,674
But I'm a costly slut.

604
00:33:35,674 --> 00:33:37,131
Deal with it.

605
00:33:37,131 --> 00:33:38,732
Ribbit.

606
00:33:38,732 --> 00:33:39,565
- Hey, hey, now settle down.

607
00:33:39,565 --> 00:33:40,565
Settle down.

608
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:43,604
Do you mind?

609
00:33:45,479 --> 00:33:47,647
- The fact that Ms. Shaw
spoke to me is not evidence

610
00:33:47,647 --> 00:33:49,462
that I committed any crime.

611
00:33:49,462 --> 00:33:51,188
Certainly not evidence that you could take

612
00:33:51,188 --> 00:33:52,300
to the police.

613
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,211
Certainly not evidence that would get you

614
00:33:54,211 --> 00:33:55,583
a search warrant.

615
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:57,333
- We don't want to go to the police

616
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:59,072
unless you force us to.

617
00:33:59,072 --> 00:34:00,589
Then of course, we will.

618
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:02,579
But then maybe nobody gets the goober.

619
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:03,941
You go to jail,

620
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,026
and you could lose your entire collection.

621
00:34:06,026 --> 00:34:07,472
- Even if I were to believe that you would

622
00:34:07,472 --> 00:34:11,222
go to the police, go to
the police with what?

623
00:34:12,495 --> 00:34:15,057
- At which point Dr. Lorca then told me

624
00:34:15,057 --> 00:34:19,322
that he meant to steal the
specimen from Mr. Lazar

625
00:34:19,322 --> 00:34:21,566
and that further he intended to employ

626
00:34:21,566 --> 00:34:25,262
his female assistant whose name is Sheila

627
00:34:25,262 --> 00:34:27,595
in furtherance of his plans.

628
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,061
Well, shoot.

629
00:34:32,061 --> 00:34:34,113
I don't want to go to jail.

630
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,993
There are lesbians there.

631
00:34:35,993 --> 00:34:39,854
- I always thought that
was one of the advantages.

632
00:34:39,854 --> 00:34:41,913
- So you see, Dr. Lorca,

633
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,163
if I don't get it, no one will have it.

634
00:34:47,003 --> 00:34:49,127
- Ms. Yost, I am prepared
to match whatever

635
00:34:49,127 --> 00:34:52,945
Mr. Lazar offered you, to the penny.

636
00:34:52,945 --> 00:34:54,977
- Well, Dr. Lorca, you must
understand that it really--

637
00:34:54,977 --> 00:34:56,440
- It's not up to her.

638
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,164
The specimen is my property.

639
00:34:58,164 --> 00:35:00,370
- She cannot sell what
is not hers to sell.

640
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:03,115
I had the right of first
refusal on any specimen.

641
00:35:03,115 --> 00:35:04,877
A right for which I paid.

642
00:35:04,877 --> 00:35:07,450
- Gentlemen, that's a matter
for the courts to decide.

643
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:10,437
- Don't be childish, my little Emilio.

644
00:35:10,437 --> 00:35:12,383
You know, I always find it amusing.

645
00:35:12,383 --> 00:35:15,349
A man like you inherits what?

646
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:17,289
$50 million dollars?

647
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:20,236
And starts to think he's really wealthy.

648
00:35:20,236 --> 00:35:22,358
Well, I'm afraid that
you're playing all together

649
00:35:22,358 --> 00:35:24,025
outside your league.

650
00:35:25,744 --> 00:35:27,327
Reconcile yourself.

651
00:35:29,255 --> 00:35:32,807
Some things are simply
too rich for your blood.

652
00:35:32,807 --> 00:35:35,940
I am a serious committed collector.

653
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,357
Not some amateur.

654
00:35:38,898 --> 00:35:41,928
- I, sir, am a gourmet of the unusual.

655
00:35:41,928 --> 00:35:45,134
You are nothing more than a gourmand.

656
00:35:45,134 --> 00:35:47,177
- I have the most complete collection of--

657
00:35:47,177 --> 00:35:49,447
- Of biological trash.

658
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:52,172
You come here barking at
my door like a mongrel.

659
00:35:52,172 --> 00:35:53,070
Very well.

660
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,485
I challenge you.

661
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,584
Even a man who putters
through life in a creaky

662
00:35:56,584 --> 00:35:59,739
succession of little
lime-green Honda Civics

663
00:35:59,739 --> 00:36:01,795
knows the superiority of the Rolls Royce

664
00:36:01,795 --> 00:36:03,730
when he sees it with his own eyes.

665
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,709
I will show you my specimens.

666
00:36:05,709 --> 00:36:07,478
If you can claim in good conscience that

667
00:36:07,478 --> 00:36:10,268
a single specimen of yours surpasses one

668
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:12,650
of my own in perfection,

669
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:15,144
then I am prepared to assure you that your

670
00:36:15,144 --> 00:36:18,510
missing specimen will be returned.

671
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:22,107
If not, then you will
disappear from my life forever

672
00:36:22,107 --> 00:36:26,189
and I will hear from you
and your cohorts no more.

673
00:36:26,189 --> 00:36:29,395
And matters stand as they are.

674
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:32,277
Do you accept my challenge?

675
00:36:32,277 --> 00:36:33,110
- Gladly.

676
00:36:35,114 --> 00:36:37,864
(dramatic music)

677
00:36:41,546 --> 00:36:44,179
- So what's with all this
table-sittin' stuff anyway?

678
00:36:44,179 --> 00:36:48,215
- It's just part of my
incredibly cute persona.

679
00:36:48,215 --> 00:36:50,308
- Gotta admit, you are pretty cute.

680
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:52,588
With the vest and the hot pants and stuff.

681
00:36:52,588 --> 00:36:55,617
You know, most women would
be a bit uncomfortable

682
00:36:55,617 --> 00:36:57,112
seeing company dressed like that,

683
00:36:57,112 --> 00:36:58,595
but you pull it off nicely.

684
00:36:58,595 --> 00:36:59,595
- Thank you.

685
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:02,465
- So what's with you and the Doc, anyway?

686
00:37:02,465 --> 00:37:03,804
You were like raised
by wolves or somethin'

687
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,659
and he found and educated ya?

688
00:37:05,659 --> 00:37:08,292
- No, I answered an ad
in the Sunday Herald.

689
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:10,787
Doc was looking for a personal assistant.

690
00:37:10,787 --> 00:37:12,877
You know, someone to clean the castle,

691
00:37:12,877 --> 00:37:14,968
take care of his
specimens, keep his books,

692
00:37:14,968 --> 00:37:16,277
write his checks.

693
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:17,963
- And he hired you?

694
00:37:17,963 --> 00:37:19,910
- I must say, it worked out rather nicely

695
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,756
for the both of us.

696
00:37:21,756 --> 00:37:23,215
Well, I have to admit,

697
00:37:23,215 --> 00:37:25,658
there aren't many places
in this big, wide world

698
00:37:25,658 --> 00:37:29,179
for someone as eccentric
and potentially dangerous

699
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:30,468
as myself fits in.

700
00:37:30,468 --> 00:37:31,727
- I can't argue with that.

701
00:37:31,727 --> 00:37:33,240
I mean, that look would definitely not fly

702
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,725
for say like a dental hygienist.

703
00:37:35,725 --> 00:37:37,716
Man, these little bitty
sandwiches are good.

704
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:38,560
What's in there?

705
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,560
Salmon?

706
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,388
- Salmon pate and watercress.

707
00:37:41,388 --> 00:37:43,011
I made the pate myself.

708
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:44,304
- [Ms. Yost] Well, I'm
glad to see you're enjoying

709
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:48,294
your little sandwiches at $160
dollars an hour, Mr. Kantor.

710
00:37:48,294 --> 00:37:49,612
- I look to serve, Ms. Yost,

711
00:37:49,612 --> 00:37:51,958
but my services are no longer required.

712
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:56,125
- [Ms. Yost] I want you to know
who the hell is keeping you.

713
00:37:57,602 --> 00:37:59,846
So where are we at, Doc?

714
00:37:59,846 --> 00:38:02,096
- Where are we at, you ask.

715
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:07,007
Well, I am here sampling some of Sheila's

716
00:38:08,262 --> 00:38:12,268
delicious pate and watercress sandwiches.

717
00:38:12,268 --> 00:38:13,742
- He's so sweet.

718
00:38:13,742 --> 00:38:16,679
- You, Mr. Kantor, and Miss Elvina Shaw

719
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:18,423
are cooling your collective heels.

720
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:21,369
Sheila is being her usual charming self.

721
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:24,280
And Mr. Lazar is in my
study having his soul

722
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,447
slowly and inexorably
crushed in a hydraulic press.

723
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,343
(footsteps)

724
00:38:33,236 --> 00:38:35,986
(dramatic music)

725
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,077
- This planarian.

726
00:38:46,104 --> 00:38:47,354
This planarian.

727
00:38:51,433 --> 00:38:55,600
It's five times larger than
any specimen known to science.

728
00:39:04,416 --> 00:39:06,249
Oh, and the condition.

729
00:39:09,332 --> 00:39:13,082
I can count the spines
on the anterior palps.

730
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:23,484
My collection, my life, a sham.

731
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:38,179
You're inhuman.

732
00:39:39,692 --> 00:39:41,692
- Then you admit defeat.

733
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:45,872
- Yes.

734
00:39:51,448 --> 00:39:55,412
No, that was only part of your collection.

735
00:39:55,412 --> 00:39:57,723
What about the human specimens, hmm?

736
00:39:57,723 --> 00:39:59,371
- And you think I would
have lower standards

737
00:39:59,371 --> 00:40:01,940
for our own species than for flatworms?

738
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,023
- Oh, no talk.

739
00:40:03,023 --> 00:40:04,229
Just show me.

740
00:40:04,229 --> 00:40:05,685
- Very well.

741
00:40:05,685 --> 00:40:07,365
Right this way, please.

742
00:40:07,365 --> 00:40:08,198
Follow me.

743
00:40:15,466 --> 00:40:16,310
- What?

744
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,609
Me, too?

745
00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:20,942
- By all means, especially you, my dear.

746
00:40:32,187 --> 00:40:33,643
Uh! My babies!

747
00:40:33,643 --> 00:40:34,626
They're gone!

748
00:40:34,626 --> 00:40:35,736
Where are they?

749
00:40:35,736 --> 00:40:36,569
Arrrhh!

750
00:40:37,526 --> 00:40:39,859
(screaming)

751
00:40:41,304 --> 00:40:42,491
- Candella, candella, candella.

752
00:40:42,491 --> 00:40:44,546
What's all this fighting about?

753
00:40:44,546 --> 00:40:45,854
Emilio.

754
00:40:45,854 --> 00:40:49,058
Emilio, let go of
Napoleon's ear right now.

755
00:40:49,058 --> 00:40:51,328
Can we act civilized, please?

756
00:40:51,328 --> 00:40:53,328
Are you listening to me?

757
00:40:54,259 --> 00:40:55,092
Don't just stand there.

758
00:40:55,092 --> 00:40:55,925
Stop them!

759
00:40:55,925 --> 00:40:56,758
- What for?

760
00:40:56,758 --> 00:40:58,000
The Doc's winning.

761
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,833
- Kantor, do you mind?

762
00:41:00,705 --> 00:41:02,227
- Ah hum, excuse me.

763
00:41:02,227 --> 00:41:05,414
Mr. Lazar, you roll Doc Lorca over on top.

764
00:41:05,414 --> 00:41:07,747
(screaming)

765
00:41:09,705 --> 00:41:10,603
All right, Doc.

766
00:41:10,603 --> 00:41:12,710
Let Napoleon down or I
start breaking some fingers.

767
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,797
Now!

768
00:41:13,797 --> 00:41:16,130
(screaming)

769
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:21,485
Now can we all settle down here?

770
00:41:21,485 --> 00:41:22,709
- I swear to God, you two.

771
00:41:22,709 --> 00:41:24,600
Make me ashamed to be
in this line of work.

772
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,085
- You'll never get away with this.

773
00:41:26,085 --> 00:41:26,944
- Neither will you.

774
00:41:26,944 --> 00:41:28,032
Where are my babies?

775
00:41:28,032 --> 00:41:28,980
What have you done with them?

776
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,376
- I don't know what you're talking about.

777
00:41:30,376 --> 00:41:31,209
- [Mr. Lorca] Liar!

778
00:41:31,209 --> 00:41:32,042
You were in the study alone.

779
00:41:32,042 --> 00:41:33,380
No one else could've touched them.

780
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,305
- Quite down, you two.

781
00:41:34,305 --> 00:41:35,357
Behave yourselves.

782
00:41:35,357 --> 00:41:38,070
Listen, you were only out
of the study for a minute.

783
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,399
How could he have found this place,

784
00:41:39,399 --> 00:41:40,418
hidden the goobers,

785
00:41:40,418 --> 00:41:41,845
and got back out in that length of time.

786
00:41:41,845 --> 00:41:42,819
- I don't know.

787
00:41:42,819 --> 00:41:45,888
Perhaps Mr. Lazar can answer
that question himself.

788
00:41:45,888 --> 00:41:49,095
- And look, there's alcohol
splattered all over the place,

789
00:41:49,095 --> 00:41:51,497
and there is none on Mr. Lazar.

790
00:41:51,497 --> 00:41:54,500
- [Ms. Yost] Look on the floor.

791
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,706
- It's just splatters.

792
00:41:55,706 --> 00:41:57,623
- No, no, no, no, look.

793
00:41:59,905 --> 00:42:02,905
(suspenseful music)

794
00:42:26,615 --> 00:42:27,448
- Ah.

795
00:42:29,303 --> 00:42:30,684
Nothing inside.

796
00:42:30,684 --> 00:42:33,050
- And just what are you suggesting?

797
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,059
That my specimens broke
out of their bottles

798
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:37,315
and climbed through the wall vent?

799
00:42:37,315 --> 00:42:39,342
No, this is all together too conveniently

800
00:42:39,342 --> 00:42:42,272
theatrical a display for my tastes.

801
00:42:42,272 --> 00:42:45,886
I want my babies back and none of you

802
00:42:45,886 --> 00:42:48,719
are leaving here until I get them.

803
00:42:49,676 --> 00:42:52,426
(dramatic music)

804
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:08,973
(specimens gurgling)

805
00:43:18,352 --> 00:43:21,435
(specimen murmuring)

806
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:30,692
- You knew your pitiful
collection of human oddities

807
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:32,143
could never match mine.

808
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:34,731
So you staged this absurdity.

809
00:43:34,731 --> 00:43:37,168
You intended this all along.

810
00:43:37,168 --> 00:43:40,934
Well, you Castilian
swine, the deal is off.

811
00:43:40,934 --> 00:43:42,972
I want my specimen back.

812
00:43:42,972 --> 00:43:44,464
- Wait a sec, wait a sec, wait a sec.

813
00:43:44,464 --> 00:43:46,485
- You think you can hide behind your lies

814
00:43:46,485 --> 00:43:47,767
or this buffoon.

815
00:43:47,767 --> 00:43:48,654
- [Mr. Kantor] Hey now, hold on.

816
00:43:48,654 --> 00:43:49,896
- You caught me by surprise.

817
00:43:49,896 --> 00:43:51,595
I will never let that happen again.

818
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:53,141
- I said wait a second.

819
00:43:53,141 --> 00:43:54,404
I don't care what any of you says.

820
00:43:54,404 --> 00:43:55,895
This is just not normal.

821
00:43:55,895 --> 00:43:57,693
- Yeah boy, there's
today's understatement.

822
00:43:57,693 --> 00:43:58,954
- [Mr. Lorca] That's enough.

823
00:43:58,954 --> 00:44:00,797
I will have my babies back.

824
00:44:00,797 --> 00:44:02,797
Sheila, seal the castle.

825
00:44:05,193 --> 00:44:07,112
(beeping)

826
00:44:07,112 --> 00:44:09,659
- What did you just do?

827
00:44:09,659 --> 00:44:10,826
- Just listen.

828
00:44:12,617 --> 00:44:15,617
(shutters slamming)

829
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:35,291
(specimen murmuring)

830
00:44:45,235 --> 00:44:47,985
(dramatic music)

831
00:44:58,597 --> 00:45:01,484
(banging)

832
00:45:01,484 --> 00:45:03,547
- This is some major fucked up shit.

833
00:45:03,547 --> 00:45:04,840
- [Ms. Yost] Ah, you noticed.

834
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,174
Good, I'm glad I'm
getting my money's worth.

835
00:45:07,174 --> 00:45:08,434
- [Mr. Kantor] I should
be charging you hazard pay

836
00:45:08,434 --> 00:45:11,503
for like psychological trauma.

837
00:45:11,503 --> 00:45:13,080
- [Sheila] Aren't you glad you installed

838
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,078
the case-hardened steel
shutters like I told you?

839
00:45:15,078 --> 00:45:16,347
- I believe the original intention was

840
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:17,918
to keep people out, not in.

841
00:45:17,918 --> 00:45:19,083
- Works both ways.

842
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:20,872
- Enough of this nonsense.

843
00:45:20,872 --> 00:45:22,140
Open the doors.

844
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:25,057
- Emilio, I am very disappointed in you.

845
00:45:25,057 --> 00:45:25,890
- [Mr. Lorca] Really?

846
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,902
Well, the disappointment is mutual.

847
00:45:27,902 --> 00:45:29,803
Now listen carefully, everyone.

848
00:45:29,803 --> 00:45:33,150
No one is leaving here until
my specimens are returned.

849
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:35,142
- What? Me, too?

850
00:45:35,142 --> 00:45:35,975
- Oh, no.

851
00:45:35,975 --> 00:45:37,385
You can go.

852
00:45:37,385 --> 00:45:39,465
- Oh, thank God.

853
00:45:39,465 --> 00:45:40,731
So now how do I get out of here if--

854
00:45:40,731 --> 00:45:42,966
- She was being sarcastic, you moron.

855
00:45:42,966 --> 00:45:43,799
- Huh?

856
00:45:45,691 --> 00:45:47,220
Well that's not very funny.

857
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,147
- Stealing is one thing,

858
00:45:48,147 --> 00:45:50,429
but kidnapping is something
all together different.

859
00:45:50,429 --> 00:45:52,293
- And assault and battery.

860
00:45:52,293 --> 00:45:54,822
- I shouldn't have to point
out that we outnumber you.

861
00:45:54,822 --> 00:45:56,916
Plus, Mr. Kantor is armed.

862
00:45:56,916 --> 00:45:59,051
- Uh, no, I'm not.

863
00:45:59,051 --> 00:46:00,351
- What?

864
00:46:00,351 --> 00:46:02,011
- I don't carry a gun.

865
00:46:02,011 --> 00:46:03,248
I don't even own one.

866
00:46:03,248 --> 00:46:06,709
- $160 dollars an hour
and you don't have a gun?

867
00:46:06,709 --> 00:46:07,542
- Who the hell do I look like?

868
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:08,375
Mannix?

869
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:10,424
You want a bodyguard, get a bodyguard.

870
00:46:10,424 --> 00:46:12,610
You pay me for my skills and investigator,

871
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:14,845
my experience and my mental prowess.

872
00:46:14,845 --> 00:46:15,961
- Oh, Christ.

873
00:46:15,961 --> 00:46:19,928
Well, even though Mr.
Kantor doesn't have a gun,

874
00:46:19,928 --> 00:46:22,976
he's clearly a match for
the both of you physically.

875
00:46:22,976 --> 00:46:24,149
You can fight, can't you?

876
00:46:24,149 --> 00:46:25,416
- Oh, yeah, sure.

877
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:26,877
- Plus, with the four of us,

878
00:46:26,877 --> 00:46:29,068
we outnumber you four to two.

879
00:46:29,068 --> 00:46:31,064
- Actually it's 11 to four.

880
00:46:31,064 --> 00:46:31,897
- What?

881
00:46:31,897 --> 00:46:36,652
- Me, the Doc, and nine
silly little millimeters.

882
00:46:36,652 --> 00:46:39,350
As in nine millimeter
semi-automatic shoots

883
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:42,309
a clip of 20 slugs in half a second.

884
00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:44,015
Aren't you glad I had you buy it for me?

885
00:46:44,015 --> 00:46:45,265
- Indeed, I am.

886
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,173
Please, everyone.

887
00:46:48,173 --> 00:46:49,361
Sit down.

888
00:46:49,361 --> 00:46:50,377
- [Elvina] What, me too?

889
00:46:50,377 --> 00:46:51,361
- [All] Yes!

890
00:46:51,361 --> 00:46:54,028
- [Elvina] All right, all right.

891
00:47:02,218 --> 00:47:04,601
- Now, I am not, despite recent events,

892
00:47:04,601 --> 00:47:06,678
an unreasonable person.

893
00:47:06,678 --> 00:47:10,238
However, let me make it perfectly clear

894
00:47:10,238 --> 00:47:13,078
that if my specimens
are not returned to me

895
00:47:13,078 --> 00:47:15,153
and in perfect condition,

896
00:47:15,153 --> 00:47:17,967
none of you are going to
get out of here alive.

897
00:47:17,967 --> 00:47:19,430
And rest assured,

898
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:22,719
if they have been harmed in any way,

899
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:26,802
whatever you have done to
them, I will do to you.

900
00:47:27,992 --> 00:47:30,179
- I'm glad you're not being unreasonable.

901
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:32,262
- Mr. Kantor, Mr. Kantor.

902
00:47:34,007 --> 00:47:36,993
Every man has an overriding passion.

903
00:47:36,993 --> 00:47:40,982
A thing for which he will do anything.

904
00:47:40,982 --> 00:47:44,261
A thing for which he will kill.

905
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:48,119
For men like me, even like Mr. Lazar,

906
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:52,690
it's the pursuit of
biologically unique oddities.

907
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:54,773
For Ms. Yost, it's money.

908
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:59,756
For the ineluctable Ms. Shaw, who can say.

909
00:47:59,756 --> 00:48:01,006
Bingo, perhaps.

910
00:48:02,469 --> 00:48:03,665
- Huh?

911
00:48:03,665 --> 00:48:05,465
- Enough, please.

912
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:09,821
Now, my dear Sheila is
going to take you upstairs

913
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:11,904
to a little room we have.

914
00:48:13,206 --> 00:48:15,418
More of a storage closet, actually.

915
00:48:15,418 --> 00:48:17,189
You will be locked in.

916
00:48:17,189 --> 00:48:19,721
Then we will search this house.

917
00:48:19,721 --> 00:48:22,874
If we find my babies in good condition,

918
00:48:22,874 --> 00:48:26,306
I will be inclined toward leniency.

919
00:48:26,306 --> 00:48:27,139
Otherwise.

920
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:31,471
Now before we drag this whole thing out,

921
00:48:32,924 --> 00:48:35,113
does someone perhaps
have something to say?

922
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:36,034
- Yeah.

923
00:48:36,034 --> 00:48:40,081
I think all of ya, inclusive,
are off to see the Wizard.

924
00:48:40,081 --> 00:48:41,924
First of all, there's no way any of us

925
00:48:41,924 --> 00:48:43,694
could've pinched your little goobers.

926
00:48:43,694 --> 00:48:46,011
Second of all, even if we did, who cares?

927
00:48:46,011 --> 00:48:47,985
Third, the whole freak thing?

928
00:48:47,985 --> 00:48:49,431
The buying, the selling, the trading?

929
00:48:49,431 --> 00:48:50,545
It's weird.

930
00:48:50,545 --> 00:48:51,378
Fucked up.

931
00:48:52,323 --> 00:48:54,030
So why don't we just go home.

932
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:56,338
You two guys can get yourself a life.

933
00:48:56,338 --> 00:48:58,683
Collect stamps, join the Y, 
go into local politics,

934
00:48:58,683 --> 00:49:01,056
go on a date, somethin'.

935
00:49:01,056 --> 00:49:04,865
- [Ms. Yost] Well that
was pretty pathetic.

936
00:49:04,865 --> 00:49:06,036
- [Elvina] What, me too?

937
00:49:06,036 --> 00:49:07,203
- [All] Yes!

938
00:49:07,203 --> 00:49:08,241
- All right.

939
00:49:08,241 --> 00:49:09,937
Everybody's yelling at me.

940
00:49:09,937 --> 00:49:11,450
You try and do the right thing.

941
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:14,627
You try to help somebody out
and this is what happens?

942
00:49:14,627 --> 00:49:15,881
- [Sheila] Come on, pigeons.

943
00:49:15,881 --> 00:49:17,631
This way to the coop.

944
00:49:26,321 --> 00:49:28,110
- Oh, don't be so gloomy.

945
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:29,409
It's the Van Gogh look.

946
00:49:29,409 --> 00:49:32,054
- It's probably already infected.

947
00:49:32,054 --> 00:49:33,124
Ms. Yost--

948
00:49:33,124 --> 00:49:35,241
- Look, we're all adults here.

949
00:49:35,241 --> 00:49:37,427
Don't be laying no grief on me.

950
00:49:37,427 --> 00:49:38,594
- I gotta pee.

951
00:49:41,441 --> 00:49:43,584
- Don't let us stop you.

952
00:49:43,584 --> 00:49:44,660
- What? What?

953
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,641
In front of everybody?

954
00:49:46,641 --> 00:49:48,941
That, that's gross!

955
00:49:48,941 --> 00:49:49,942
Pfff, pfff.

956
00:49:49,942 --> 00:49:51,608
Hey, knock it off!

957
00:49:51,608 --> 00:49:52,441
- Hey, baby.

958
00:49:52,441 --> 00:49:53,948
You want to come up and
try this for awhile?

959
00:49:53,948 --> 00:49:54,960
You don't like it?

960
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,793
Move.

961
00:49:57,044 --> 00:49:59,928
Ah, talk about a dog shit day.

962
00:49:59,928 --> 00:50:02,365
Goes to show ya, you work for squirrels,

963
00:50:02,365 --> 00:50:03,698
you end up nuts.

964
00:50:05,186 --> 00:50:08,240
All right, pass me up something heavy.

965
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,195
- How much do you weigh, Elvina?

966
00:50:10,195 --> 00:50:11,577
- Huh?

967
00:50:11,577 --> 00:50:12,410
- Hey, knock it off.

968
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:15,275
My arms are gettin' tired.

969
00:50:15,275 --> 00:50:16,275
- Excuse me.

970
00:50:19,114 --> 00:50:22,062
(banging)

971
00:50:22,062 --> 00:50:25,729
(plaster and wood cracking)

972
00:50:29,748 --> 00:50:31,972
- All right, stand clear.

973
00:50:31,972 --> 00:50:35,639
(plaster and wood cracking)

974
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:39,943
(banging)

975
00:50:39,943 --> 00:50:42,749
- Well, sure knew how
to build 'em back then.

976
00:50:42,749 --> 00:50:45,804
- Well, what are we gonna do now?

977
00:50:45,804 --> 00:50:46,637
- Damn.

978
00:50:48,846 --> 00:50:52,096
(eerie dramatic music)

979
00:51:00,621 --> 00:51:03,538
(specimen banging)

980
00:51:05,071 --> 00:51:08,154
- What the hell's that banging sound?

981
00:51:10,103 --> 00:51:13,681
(specimen murmuring)

982
00:51:13,681 --> 00:51:16,598
(specimen banging)

983
00:51:20,542 --> 00:51:23,625
(specimen murmuring)

984
00:51:36,395 --> 00:51:38,562
(banging)

985
00:51:42,261 --> 00:51:43,636
- Hey, hey.

986
00:51:43,636 --> 00:51:44,474
- [Ms. Yost] What? What is it?

987
00:51:44,474 --> 00:51:45,914
- Hey, listen.

988
00:51:45,914 --> 00:51:48,646
- [Mr. Lazar] Where is it coming from?

989
00:51:48,646 --> 00:51:51,563
- It's the other side of this wall.

990
00:51:53,633 --> 00:51:55,800
(banging)

991
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:01,433
(specimen murmuring)

992
00:52:05,765 --> 00:52:08,682
(specimen banging)

993
00:52:10,487 --> 00:52:11,588
- [Ms. Yost] Who could it be?

994
00:52:11,588 --> 00:52:13,675
- More of Lorca's prisoners, no doubt.

995
00:52:13,675 --> 00:52:16,574
He may have dozens for all we know.

996
00:52:16,574 --> 00:52:19,828
- Well there's a comforting thought.

997
00:52:19,828 --> 00:52:22,512
(sighing)

998
00:52:22,512 --> 00:52:24,679
(banging)

999
00:52:26,709 --> 00:52:29,737
(specimen murmuring)

1000
00:52:29,737 --> 00:52:32,938
(specimen banging)

1001
00:52:32,938 --> 00:52:35,525
I don't suppose anybody
here knows Morse Code?

1002
00:52:35,525 --> 00:52:37,498
- Unless it's a telegraph
operator on the other side

1003
00:52:37,498 --> 00:52:38,756
of the wall it really doesn't matter much

1004
00:52:38,756 --> 00:52:40,342
now does it?

1005
00:52:40,342 --> 00:52:41,833
- I guess not.

1006
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:44,058
Hey, other side of the wall?

1007
00:52:44,058 --> 00:52:45,199
Can you hear me?

1008
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:47,782
Knock twice if you can hear me.

1009
00:52:49,695 --> 00:52:52,847
(specimen knocking)

1010
00:52:52,847 --> 00:52:54,497
Are you prisoners, too?

1011
00:52:54,497 --> 00:52:56,588
Knock twice if you are.

1012
00:52:56,588 --> 00:52:58,142
(specimen knocking)

1013
00:52:58,142 --> 00:52:59,233
Hey, so are we.

1014
00:52:59,233 --> 00:53:00,801
We're locked in this closet.

1015
00:53:00,801 --> 00:53:02,332
Are you locked in, too?

1016
00:53:02,332 --> 00:53:04,508
Knock twice if you are.

1017
00:53:04,508 --> 00:53:07,752
(specimen murmuring)

1018
00:53:07,752 --> 00:53:10,169
Can you get out of your room?

1019
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:14,355
(specimen murmuring)

1020
00:53:14,355 --> 00:53:15,675
(specimen knocking)

1021
00:53:15,675 --> 00:53:17,880
- If you can hear you,
why is he knocking at all?

1022
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,130
Why doesn't he just answer?

1023
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:24,324
- Maybe he's a deaf mute.

1024
00:53:25,505 --> 00:53:29,672
- Elvina, if he were deaf, how
could he hear the questions?

1025
00:53:31,094 --> 00:53:33,677
- Well, maybe he, I don't know.

1026
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:37,445
- Right, clear out of my way.

1027
00:53:37,445 --> 00:53:38,827
All right, you out there.

1028
00:53:38,827 --> 00:53:40,365
We're locked in this closet,

1029
00:53:40,365 --> 00:53:41,198
and as you probably know,

1030
00:53:41,198 --> 00:53:42,700
the entire freaking castle is sealed up

1031
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,572
tighter than a locked jaw.

1032
00:53:44,572 --> 00:53:46,168
It don't look too good
for us and it probably

1033
00:53:46,168 --> 00:53:47,938
don't look too good for you, either.

1034
00:53:47,938 --> 00:53:49,156
You help us, we'll help you.

1035
00:53:49,156 --> 00:53:50,489
What do you say?

1036
00:53:51,747 --> 00:53:53,790
(specimen knocking)

1037
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:56,559
All right, can you get
out of wherever you're at?

1038
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:57,895
(knocking)

1039
00:53:57,895 --> 00:53:58,728
All right, baby.

1040
00:53:58,728 --> 00:54:00,743
This is the $64,000 dollar question now.

1041
00:54:00,743 --> 00:54:04,076
Can you unlock this door and get us out?

1042
00:54:07,075 --> 00:54:09,362
Does that mean you can't?

1043
00:54:09,362 --> 00:54:12,445
(specimen murmuring)

1044
00:54:15,316 --> 00:54:17,057
Am I boring you?

1045
00:54:17,057 --> 00:54:18,856
- [Mr. Kantor] Listen.

1046
00:54:18,856 --> 00:54:20,978
- Hey, are you out there or not?

1047
00:54:20,978 --> 00:54:22,116
(specimen knocking)

1048
00:54:22,116 --> 00:54:25,724
Honey, honey, can you unlock
this door and get us out?

1049
00:54:25,724 --> 00:54:28,807
(specimen murmuring)

1050
00:54:30,869 --> 00:54:32,202
How's it coming?

1051
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,845
What the hell?

1052
00:54:39,845 --> 00:54:41,178
Doe la the open?

1053
00:54:43,214 --> 00:54:44,317
- You know what?

1054
00:54:44,317 --> 00:54:45,839
I bet it's a kid.

1055
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,585
Maybe a little kid.

1056
00:54:47,585 --> 00:54:49,527
- I can't make head nor tails of that.

1057
00:54:49,527 --> 00:54:51,262
- It says door locked.

1058
00:54:51,262 --> 00:54:52,095
How open?

1059
00:54:55,601 --> 00:54:56,434
- Listen up.

1060
00:54:56,434 --> 00:54:57,953
You need to get a crowbar.

1061
00:54:57,953 --> 00:54:59,576
It's a metal bar with
an edge to slip between

1062
00:54:59,576 --> 00:55:01,300
the door and the jamb.

1063
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,599
You understand?

1064
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:04,869
(knocking)

1065
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:06,638
How many of you are out there?

1066
00:55:06,638 --> 00:55:08,888
(knocking)

1067
00:55:10,784 --> 00:55:12,406
What the hell?

1068
00:55:12,406 --> 00:55:13,489
Four of them?

1069
00:55:16,475 --> 00:55:20,142
(loud rattling and banging)

1070
00:55:34,434 --> 00:55:35,769
- My babies.

1071
00:55:35,769 --> 00:55:37,747
It makes no sense.

1072
00:55:37,747 --> 00:55:40,159
None of them could've gotten
upstairs without being seen

1073
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:42,013
unless someone would have
had to walk through this room

1074
00:55:42,013 --> 00:55:44,376
in order to reach the rest of the house.

1075
00:55:44,376 --> 00:55:46,043
Where could they be?

1076
00:55:47,278 --> 00:55:51,445
Unless, unless he put them
in the acid bath after all.

1077
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:56,455
Perhaps his over-inflated
ego couldn't accept

1078
00:55:56,455 --> 00:55:59,079
utter defeat at my hands.

1079
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:00,746
Perhaps my babies...

1080
00:56:05,041 --> 00:56:08,016
- Doc, can I give you some advice?

1081
00:56:08,016 --> 00:56:08,933
- Yes, yes.

1082
00:56:11,186 --> 00:56:13,033
- Someone upstairs in
that closet has to have

1083
00:56:13,033 --> 00:56:16,296
a pretty good idea what
happened to your babies.

1084
00:56:16,296 --> 00:56:17,963
Let's motivate them.

1085
00:56:19,644 --> 00:56:22,477
- Yes, and we'll start with Lazar.

1086
00:56:26,047 --> 00:56:27,325
- I think they've got it.

1087
00:56:27,325 --> 00:56:28,158
Do you have it?

1088
00:56:28,158 --> 00:56:30,158
Do you have the crowbar?

1089
00:56:31,184 --> 00:56:33,360
Okay, stand back.

1090
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,027
(door creaking)

1091
00:56:36,966 --> 00:56:38,031
That's it.

1092
00:56:38,031 --> 00:56:39,320
It's coming!

1093
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,237
Keep it up!

1094
00:56:41,493 --> 00:56:43,285
- I'll pay you a $100,000
dollars if you can

1095
00:56:43,285 --> 00:56:45,470
get me out of this house.

1096
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:48,762
(door creaking)

1097
00:56:48,762 --> 00:56:51,845
(specimen murmuring)

1098
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:57,060
(specimen grunting)

1099
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,666
(door creaking)

1100
00:57:03,806 --> 00:57:04,639
- Uh, uh.

1101
00:57:05,686 --> 00:57:07,603
It's, it's magnificent.

1102
00:57:09,831 --> 00:57:11,331
Look, my specimen.

1103
00:57:13,088 --> 00:57:14,568
My specimen.

1104
00:57:14,568 --> 00:57:15,485
It's alive.

1105
00:57:16,794 --> 00:57:17,803
- [Mr. Kantor] You know,
suddenly this closet

1106
00:57:17,803 --> 00:57:19,120
doesn't seem so bad.

1107
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,464
- [Mr. Lazar] Do you
think they're dangerous?

1108
00:57:20,464 --> 00:57:21,680
- [Mr. Kantor] I think
that would be numbered

1109
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,061
among the possibilities, yes.

1110
00:57:23,061 --> 00:57:26,453
- Ms. Yost, I've got to have them.

1111
00:57:26,453 --> 00:57:27,315
- What?

1112
00:57:27,315 --> 00:57:29,531
- Listen to me, all of you.

1113
00:57:29,531 --> 00:57:31,748
I'll give you a million dollars each

1114
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:34,863
if you help me catch them
and get them out of here.

1115
00:57:34,863 --> 00:57:35,696
- Are your brains fried?

1116
00:57:35,696 --> 00:57:37,559
What are you talkin' about?

1117
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:38,774
- [Elvina] I'll do it.

1118
00:57:38,774 --> 00:57:39,775
- What?

1119
00:57:39,775 --> 00:57:41,481
- For a million dollars?

1120
00:57:41,481 --> 00:57:42,314
I'll help.

1121
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:45,858
Hey, I gotta look to the future.

1122
00:57:45,858 --> 00:57:48,108
I mean, since I'm unemployed.

1123
00:57:48,108 --> 00:57:49,230
- I'm in.

1124
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:50,602
For two million.

1125
00:57:50,602 --> 00:57:51,445
- What?

1126
00:57:51,445 --> 00:57:52,372
- Hey, if she's getting a million,

1127
00:57:52,372 --> 00:57:53,827
I'm worth at least two.

1128
00:57:53,827 --> 00:57:55,857
- Very well. Done.

1129
00:57:55,857 --> 00:57:57,739
I take it you're sitting
this one out, Mr. Kantor?

1130
00:57:57,739 --> 00:57:59,762
- Can we all hold on a second here?

1131
00:57:59,762 --> 00:58:02,430
Hasn't anybody noticed anything strange?

1132
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:03,693
- [Elvina] Like what?

1133
00:58:03,693 --> 00:58:06,380
- Like the fact that these
freaks are like alive?

1134
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:07,463
I mean, that's a little bit odd.

1135
00:58:07,463 --> 00:58:08,585
Even for you.

1136
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:11,341
You guys are all Dr.
Lorca's freaks, right?

1137
00:58:11,341 --> 00:58:13,473
You were all pickled in bottles, dead?

1138
00:58:13,473 --> 00:58:15,237
I mean, somebody correct
me if I'm wrong here,

1139
00:58:15,237 --> 00:58:17,894
but this is not normal.

1140
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:20,045
These guys no longer
fall into the category

1141
00:58:20,045 --> 00:58:22,741
of being like biological oddities.

1142
00:58:22,741 --> 00:58:25,533
- Of course I understand that.

1143
00:58:25,533 --> 00:58:28,533
They are unique biological oddities.

1144
00:58:32,652 --> 00:58:34,691
(specimen murmuring)

1145
00:58:34,691 --> 00:58:36,248
- My babies!

1146
00:58:36,248 --> 00:58:37,998
You're, you're alive.

1147
00:58:39,939 --> 00:58:43,080
- Get one of those blankets.

1148
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,963
- No, no gun.

1149
00:58:44,963 --> 00:58:47,296
We can't risk injuring them.

1150
00:58:48,144 --> 00:58:50,509
- Doc, this is really not normal.

1151
00:58:50,509 --> 00:58:51,942
- [Mr. Kantor] That's what I said.

1152
00:58:51,942 --> 00:58:53,260
- Get away from them, Lorca.

1153
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:54,770
They're coming with me.

1154
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:55,603
- Really?

1155
00:58:55,603 --> 00:58:57,175
And where do you think you're going?

1156
00:58:57,175 --> 00:59:01,677
- I'm gonna give them the
home that they deserve.

1157
00:59:01,677 --> 00:59:05,945
Gourmet food, sophisticated entertainment,

1158
00:59:05,945 --> 00:59:08,778
the finest education, a gymnasium.

1159
00:59:10,429 --> 00:59:12,762
Anything, anything you want.

1160
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:15,704
- Don't listen to him.

1161
00:59:15,704 --> 00:59:18,140
Who kept you safe in your bottles?

1162
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:19,346
Who tended you?

1163
00:59:19,346 --> 00:59:20,634
Who loved you?

1164
00:59:20,634 --> 00:59:22,435
Don't listen to that man.

1165
00:59:22,435 --> 00:59:24,444
To him you'll never be more than another

1166
00:59:24,444 --> 00:59:26,316
notch in his belt.

1167
00:59:26,316 --> 00:59:28,316
- Oh, don't believe him.

1168
00:59:29,721 --> 00:59:33,020
All he wants to do is
put you on a pedestal.

1169
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:34,437
I, I respect you.

1170
00:59:37,403 --> 00:59:39,822
- Wow, this is really weird.

1171
00:59:39,822 --> 00:59:43,905
- I want to help you
develop your full potential.

1172
00:59:47,324 --> 00:59:50,491
(specimen whimpering)

1173
00:59:56,807 --> 00:59:58,634
- Now see what you've done?

1174
00:59:58,634 --> 01:00:00,778
You've upset him.

1175
01:00:00,778 --> 01:00:03,167
Calm down, my baby.

1176
01:00:03,167 --> 01:00:05,156
My little baby.

1177
01:00:05,156 --> 01:00:06,559
- I've upset him?

1178
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:07,392
It was you--

1179
01:00:07,392 --> 01:00:08,225
- Ah, hell.

1180
01:00:08,225 --> 01:00:09,173
I'm gonna throw the blanket.

1181
01:00:09,173 --> 01:00:10,648
(specimen screaming)

1182
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,805
Sometimes it just takes a woman to--

1183
01:00:12,805 --> 01:00:14,316
- My babies.

1184
01:00:14,316 --> 01:00:17,263
(screaming)

1185
01:00:17,263 --> 01:00:18,263
- My jewels!

1186
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:20,889
- My ass!

1187
01:00:20,889 --> 01:00:22,483
Ah, God damn it!

1188
01:00:22,483 --> 01:00:24,387
(specimen squealing)

1189
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:25,220
(screaming)

1190
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:27,220
- [Sheila] I'll get 'em!

1191
01:00:28,144 --> 01:00:29,598
- Stop! Stop!

1192
01:00:29,598 --> 01:00:31,931
(screaming)

1193
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:37,215
- [Both] Don't hurt them!

1194
01:00:38,212 --> 01:00:40,611
- I'm doin' my best, Doc.

1195
01:00:40,611 --> 01:00:42,944
(screaming)

1196
01:00:58,512 --> 01:01:00,643
- Get your hands off of him.

1197
01:01:00,643 --> 01:01:02,314
- It's your attendant
that's doing him harm.

1198
01:01:02,314 --> 01:01:03,147
Stop it. Stop it.

1199
01:01:03,147 --> 01:01:05,260
You're hurting him.

1200
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:07,593
(screaming)

1201
01:01:08,655 --> 01:01:09,488
- You see?

1202
01:01:09,488 --> 01:01:11,405
He knows who loves him.

1203
01:01:14,917 --> 01:01:15,750
(gun firing)

1204
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:16,808
- Get back!

1205
01:01:16,808 --> 01:01:18,292
Run! Run!

1206
01:01:18,292 --> 01:01:19,938
(gun firing)

1207
01:01:19,938 --> 01:01:22,271
(screaming)

1208
01:01:27,219 --> 01:01:30,788
(specimen murmuring)

1209
01:01:30,788 --> 01:01:33,121
(screaming)

1210
01:01:38,429 --> 01:01:39,679
- Are you okay?

1211
01:01:40,541 --> 01:01:41,874
- Sure, why not?

1212
01:01:42,849 --> 01:01:43,712
- No reason.

1213
01:01:43,712 --> 01:01:45,129
No reason at all.

1214
01:01:46,032 --> 01:01:49,747
Is there any other way
in or out of this place?

1215
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:52,580
- No, not with the windows sealed.

1216
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,113
- Damn.

1217
01:01:59,527 --> 01:02:02,610
(specimen murmuring)

1218
01:02:09,582 --> 01:02:12,309
(door creaking)

1219
01:02:12,309 --> 01:02:13,994
Oh, crowbar.

1220
01:02:13,994 --> 01:02:14,921
- [Sheila] Don't worry.

1221
01:02:14,921 --> 01:02:16,200
Deadbolt runs from side to side

1222
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,752
through the ceiling and the floor.

1223
01:02:17,752 --> 01:02:20,186
He's not prying it open.

1224
01:02:20,186 --> 01:02:21,857
- I guess the Doc believes in security

1225
01:02:21,857 --> 01:02:23,323
when he's sleepin'.

1226
01:02:23,323 --> 01:02:25,240
- Not really, but I do.

1227
01:02:26,277 --> 01:02:27,610
This is my room.

1228
01:02:29,854 --> 01:02:32,068
- [Mr. Kantor] Ah, nice room.

1229
01:02:32,068 --> 01:02:33,533
Very tasteful.

1230
01:02:33,533 --> 01:02:36,156
- [Sheila] Well, I'm a
very tasteful person.

1231
01:02:36,156 --> 01:02:39,436
(door creaking)

1232
01:02:39,436 --> 01:02:42,436
(specimen grunting)

1233
01:02:52,076 --> 01:02:54,659
- I guess they've quit for now.

1234
01:02:57,189 --> 01:03:00,439
(dramatic organ music)

1235
01:03:13,388 --> 01:03:16,638
(eerie dramatic music)

1236
01:03:42,242 --> 01:03:44,575
- [Ms. Yost] Ah, ah, ah, ah.

1237
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:50,751
- Mmm, mmm, mmm.

1238
01:03:50,751 --> 01:03:51,860
I must confess.

1239
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:53,605
I'm finding this process--

1240
01:03:53,605 --> 01:03:54,820
- [Ms. Yost] Ah.

1241
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:56,332
- Rather stimulating.

1242
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:57,686
- Yeah, nappy?

1243
01:03:57,686 --> 01:03:58,807
Uh.

1244
01:03:58,807 --> 01:04:00,399
Well, I gotta tell you,

1245
01:04:00,399 --> 01:04:02,161
normally having my ass admired by some guy

1246
01:04:02,161 --> 01:04:04,050
who's richer than God would get my juices

1247
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:05,888
flowing lickety split,

1248
01:04:05,888 --> 01:04:08,685
but to be perfectly honest, I'm just, oh,

1249
01:04:08,685 --> 01:04:10,018
not in the mood.

1250
01:04:11,283 --> 01:04:13,552
- Just as well, I suppose.

1251
01:04:13,552 --> 01:04:16,354
The atmosphere is hardly conducive.

1252
01:04:16,354 --> 01:04:19,118
And of course we need to
talk about my specimens.

1253
01:04:19,118 --> 01:04:20,488
- Honey, as things
stand now it's more like

1254
01:04:20,488 --> 01:04:22,934
we're their specimens,
if you catch my drift.

1255
01:04:22,934 --> 01:04:23,827
Oh.

1256
01:04:23,827 --> 01:04:27,440
- Well, the first cause of
action is immobilize Lorca

1257
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,387
and that dangerous assistant.

1258
01:04:29,387 --> 01:04:31,342
Then we scour the house,

1259
01:04:31,342 --> 01:04:33,142
and when we find the specimens,

1260
01:04:33,142 --> 01:04:35,005
I will convince them to come with us.

1261
01:04:35,005 --> 01:04:38,805
Or if necessary, take them by force.

1262
01:04:38,805 --> 01:04:39,880
- Ah!

1263
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,827
I see you got this all planned out.

1264
01:04:41,827 --> 01:04:43,337
- [Mr. Lazar] For their
own good, of course.

1265
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:44,312
- Of course.

1266
01:04:44,312 --> 01:04:48,144
- And of course, your
assistance will be of

1267
01:04:48,144 --> 01:04:50,513
enormous value to me.

1268
01:04:50,513 --> 01:04:51,690
- Ah!

1269
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:53,036
Value?

1270
01:04:53,036 --> 01:04:54,880
- Oh, monetary value.

1271
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,187
- Uh.

1272
01:04:56,187 --> 01:04:57,586
- Enormous.

1273
01:04:57,586 --> 01:04:58,783
- [Ms. Yost] Uh.

1274
01:04:58,783 --> 01:04:59,945
- [Mr. Lazar] Enormous.

1275
01:04:59,945 --> 01:05:00,792
- [Ms. Yost] Uh.

1276
01:05:00,792 --> 01:05:02,209
- Monetary value.

1277
01:05:03,271 --> 01:05:04,167
- Uh.

1278
01:05:04,167 --> 01:05:06,079
(laughing)

1279
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:10,246
Oh, nappy, you're really
speaking my language now.

1280
01:05:16,191 --> 01:05:20,437
- Why Ms. Yost, I've never
seen you looking nicer.

1281
01:05:20,437 --> 01:05:21,270
Do me a favor?

1282
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:23,177
Make this one a quicky, will you, you two?

1283
01:05:23,177 --> 01:05:24,662
I gotta pee.

1284
01:05:24,662 --> 01:05:27,426
Oh, and remember this is my bathroom.

1285
01:05:27,426 --> 01:05:30,593
A little hygiene would be appreciated.

1286
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:37,370
- I'm sure that the key to this matter

1287
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:39,870
is my most recent acquisition.

1288
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:43,168
This being is almost certainly responsible

1289
01:05:43,168 --> 01:05:46,877
for the revivification of the others.

1290
01:05:46,877 --> 01:05:50,014
- So we kill him, the others are paste.

1291
01:05:50,014 --> 01:05:51,017
Is that the idea?

1292
01:05:51,017 --> 01:05:51,850
- Kill?

1293
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:52,683
Of course not.

1294
01:05:52,683 --> 01:05:53,603
Are you insane?

1295
01:05:53,603 --> 01:05:57,014
I mean that the new one is
the one we must reason with.

1296
01:05:57,014 --> 01:05:58,263
Persuade.

1297
01:05:58,263 --> 01:06:00,724
Their recent actions
were merely self-defense

1298
01:06:00,724 --> 01:06:03,988
in response to Ms.
Yost's irrational attack.

1299
01:06:03,988 --> 01:06:07,556
I truly believe they
do not mean to harm us.

1300
01:06:07,556 --> 01:06:11,723
No doubt they are hiding
some place now, terrified.

1301
01:06:15,498 --> 01:06:18,665
(specimens squealing)

1302
01:06:22,255 --> 01:06:25,005
(dramatic music)

1303
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:43,369
- Look, can we at least agree not to enter

1304
01:06:43,369 --> 01:06:45,859
into open combat 'til
all the little goobers

1305
01:06:45,859 --> 01:06:47,684
are locked up nice and safe?

1306
01:06:47,684 --> 01:06:48,806
Can we do that?

1307
01:06:48,806 --> 01:06:50,024
- [Mr. Lazar] And who
exactly is gonna be doing

1308
01:06:50,024 --> 01:06:51,485
the locking up?

1309
01:06:51,485 --> 01:06:53,144
- The rightful guardian.

1310
01:06:53,144 --> 01:06:54,312
- [Mr. Lazar] Well, I
believe you're going to

1311
01:06:54,312 --> 01:06:58,735
monopolize the discovery
that should be, should be--

1312
01:06:58,735 --> 01:07:00,357
- [Mr. Larco] Monopolized by you?

1313
01:07:00,357 --> 01:07:01,710
- [Mr. Lazar] Yes.

1314
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:03,323
- Well, let me warn all of you.

1315
01:07:03,323 --> 01:07:04,965
This house is still sealed.

1316
01:07:04,965 --> 01:07:07,216
And only Sheila and I
know the proper code key

1317
01:07:07,216 --> 01:07:09,814
that will unlock the doors and windows.

1318
01:07:09,814 --> 01:07:11,897
This house is impervious.

1319
01:07:13,698 --> 01:07:15,948
(knocking)

1320
01:07:18,175 --> 01:07:21,140
- [Mr. Kantor] Oh, what now?

1321
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:23,099
Are you still out there?

1322
01:07:23,099 --> 01:07:24,157
(knocking)

1323
01:07:24,157 --> 01:07:26,007
Can you tell us what you want?

1324
01:07:26,007 --> 01:07:28,427
(knocking)

1325
01:07:28,427 --> 01:07:29,335
- [Ms. Yost] You're
not planning on opening

1326
01:07:29,335 --> 01:07:31,624
that door, are you?

1327
01:07:31,624 --> 01:07:33,109
- They stuck a note under the door before.

1328
01:07:33,109 --> 01:07:35,065
They can do it again.

1329
01:07:35,065 --> 01:07:36,899
Can you write down what you want from us?

1330
01:07:36,899 --> 01:07:38,967
We don't want to hurt you.

1331
01:07:38,967 --> 01:07:39,800
(pencil scribbling)

1332
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,894
- [Mr. Lazar] Listen.

1333
01:07:40,894 --> 01:07:42,078
(pencil scribbling)

1334
01:07:42,078 --> 01:07:43,572
- How could they know how to write?

1335
01:07:43,572 --> 01:07:44,998
It makes no sense.

1336
01:07:44,998 --> 01:07:46,748
- They did it before.

1337
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:51,881
(specimen murmuring)

1338
01:07:59,292 --> 01:08:01,917
- And is it a friendly message?

1339
01:08:01,917 --> 01:08:03,636
- [Mr. Lazar] It's gibberish.

1340
01:08:03,636 --> 01:08:05,044
- No, it isn't.

1341
01:08:05,044 --> 01:08:07,794
The message reads, "You hurt bad.

1342
01:08:09,769 --> 01:08:10,936
"Scared, hurt.

1343
01:08:12,932 --> 01:08:13,932
"We no stay.

1344
01:08:15,868 --> 01:08:17,528
"We go.

1345
01:08:17,528 --> 01:08:18,778
"You let us go.

1346
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:22,517
"We no go, you die."

1347
01:08:26,161 --> 01:08:28,920
- That certainly seems pretty clear.

1348
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:30,536
- [Mr. Larco] It is clear
that we are dealing in essence

1349
01:08:30,536 --> 01:08:33,621
with a single dominant intellect.

1350
01:08:33,621 --> 01:08:35,376
- [Mr. Kantor] You mean
that double-face one.

1351
01:08:35,376 --> 01:08:37,051
- [Mr. Larco] Yes.

1352
01:08:37,051 --> 01:08:39,944
If in fact this being is
only a day or two old,

1353
01:08:39,944 --> 01:08:42,780
then it has absorbed
human speech and reading

1354
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:46,464
and a fairly sophisticated
level of comprehension

1355
01:08:46,464 --> 01:08:48,593
in just a matter of hours.

1356
01:08:48,593 --> 01:08:50,603
In addition, it seems to have some sort of

1357
01:08:50,603 --> 01:08:53,006
tentacle hormaphic power,

1358
01:08:53,006 --> 01:08:56,448
though it does not appear
to have influenced us.

1359
01:08:56,448 --> 01:08:59,077
It is an altogether new
kind of intelligence.

1360
01:08:59,077 --> 01:09:00,910
Perhaps a new species.

1361
01:09:03,585 --> 01:09:05,752
(sighing)

1362
01:09:14,628 --> 01:09:16,997
(specimen murmuring)

1363
01:09:16,997 --> 01:09:19,164
(sighing)

1364
01:09:39,889 --> 01:09:42,222
- [Elvina] Mmm, mmm, oh, ah.

1365
01:09:49,014 --> 01:09:50,431
Mmm, mmm, ah, ah.

1366
01:09:56,224 --> 01:09:57,641
Mmm, mmm, ah, ah.

1367
01:10:03,261 --> 01:10:04,594
Mmm, ah, ah, ah.

1368
01:10:14,069 --> 01:10:16,402
(screaming)

1369
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:22,215
Ah, get it off!

1370
01:10:22,215 --> 01:10:23,132
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1371
01:10:26,153 --> 01:10:27,497
No, please!

1372
01:10:27,497 --> 01:10:28,330
Ah! Ah!

1373
01:10:32,155 --> 01:10:33,988
- Hold still, pinhead!

1374
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:37,499
Oh, sorry, Doc!

1375
01:10:37,499 --> 01:10:38,910
(screaming)

1376
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:40,626
- [Both] Get him!

1377
01:10:40,626 --> 01:10:42,959
(screaming)

1378
01:10:44,704 --> 01:10:45,621
- Oh, sick!

1379
01:10:48,269 --> 01:10:50,325
- Somebody watch the door.

1380
01:10:50,325 --> 01:10:51,353
- [Elvina] That pervert!

1381
01:10:51,353 --> 01:10:52,781
Pervert from hell!

1382
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:54,723
(screaming)

1383
01:10:54,723 --> 01:10:55,556
- [Mr. Kantor] Wait a second!

1384
01:10:55,556 --> 01:10:57,142
Don't go runnin' around!

1385
01:10:57,142 --> 01:10:58,357
Hold on, blondie, where are you goin'?

1386
01:10:58,357 --> 01:11:00,213
- [Elvina] Help me! Help me!

1387
01:11:00,213 --> 01:11:01,258
(screaming)

1388
01:11:01,258 --> 01:11:02,091
Help me!

1389
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:02,924
- [Mr. Kantor] It got up there.

1390
01:11:02,924 --> 01:11:03,873
Where are you?

1391
01:11:03,873 --> 01:11:06,206
(screaming)

1392
01:11:15,082 --> 01:11:17,832
(glass breaking)

1393
01:11:20,414 --> 01:11:22,331
- Jesus fucking Christ!

1394
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:27,956
- Did she hurt them?

1395
01:11:27,956 --> 01:11:30,539
- No, no, I think they're okay.

1396
01:11:31,744 --> 01:11:33,827
- Then get out of my way!

1397
01:11:36,245 --> 01:11:39,412
(specimen whimpering)

1398
01:12:03,963 --> 01:12:07,213
Little ones, I'll take you out of here.

1399
01:12:08,516 --> 01:12:11,183
But first you have to kill them.

1400
01:12:13,181 --> 01:12:14,366
- Hey, hey, hey.

1401
01:12:14,366 --> 01:12:15,534
- No, no, no, no, no.

1402
01:12:15,534 --> 01:12:16,769
Not all of them.

1403
01:12:16,769 --> 01:12:18,019
Just those two.

1404
01:12:19,913 --> 01:12:22,920
But first, you've got
to force them to tell

1405
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,405
you the key code.

1406
01:12:24,405 --> 01:12:25,817
- Don't listen to him.

1407
01:12:25,817 --> 01:12:27,439
It's dangerous out there.

1408
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:28,978
Stay here with me.

1409
01:12:28,978 --> 01:12:30,200
You'll be safe.

1410
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,617
I'll take you out for drives.

1411
01:12:35,524 --> 01:12:38,554
(specimen murmuring)

1412
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:39,387
Come back.

1413
01:12:46,173 --> 01:12:48,090
- [Ms. Yost] Excuse me.

1414
01:12:50,269 --> 01:12:52,905
- Jesus, all we need is
a guy in a white suit

1415
01:12:52,905 --> 01:12:57,072
and a butterfly net to make
this freakin' scene complete.

1416
01:12:58,484 --> 01:13:00,925
- Come out, come out little ones.

1417
01:13:00,925 --> 01:13:02,480
Come to papa.

1418
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,685
- Wherever you are, don't listen to him.

1419
01:13:04,685 --> 01:13:06,185
I'm your papa, me!

1420
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:10,943
(specimen murmuring)

1421
01:13:10,943 --> 01:13:13,168
There, there you are.

1422
01:13:13,168 --> 01:13:14,996
Don't be afraid.

1423
01:13:14,996 --> 01:13:16,831
I'm not going to hurt you.

1424
01:13:16,831 --> 01:13:18,481
This is your home.

1425
01:13:18,481 --> 01:13:19,314
- No, no, no.

1426
01:13:19,314 --> 01:13:20,147
You belong to me.

1427
01:13:20,147 --> 01:13:22,177
I'm the only one who's worthy of you.

1428
01:13:22,177 --> 01:13:23,643
- Get back, you interloper.

1429
01:13:23,643 --> 01:13:24,976
- No, he's mine!

1430
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:29,199
- [Both] No!

1431
01:13:32,344 --> 01:13:33,177
- [Mr. Larco] You fool!

1432
01:13:33,177 --> 01:13:34,488
You bastard!

1433
01:13:34,488 --> 01:13:37,224
- [Mr. Lazar] You're
nothing but a cheap fraud.

1434
01:13:37,224 --> 01:13:39,474
(grunting)

1435
01:13:47,978 --> 01:13:49,311
- That's enough.

1436
01:13:51,587 --> 01:13:53,751
Let's settle this once and for all.

1437
01:13:53,751 --> 01:13:55,185
If you're man enough.

1438
01:13:55,185 --> 01:13:56,769
- I was man enough to deal with you

1439
01:13:56,769 --> 01:14:01,293
before I collected my first
spheroid bryozoan colony.

1440
01:14:01,293 --> 01:14:02,626
- No more words.

1441
01:14:06,115 --> 01:14:07,032
Steel only.

1442
01:14:10,131 --> 01:14:10,964
En garde.

1443
01:14:14,089 --> 01:14:17,093
(swords clanging)

1444
01:14:17,093 --> 01:14:19,343
(grunting)

1445
01:14:21,226 --> 01:14:23,059
- Ah, excuse me, boys.

1446
01:14:25,805 --> 01:14:27,722
I'll just keep looking.

1447
01:14:29,238 --> 01:14:32,071
(swords clanging)

1448
01:14:33,603 --> 01:14:35,853
(grunting)

1449
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:39,690
(dramatic music)

1450
01:14:44,263 --> 01:14:46,513
(grunting)

1451
01:14:48,585 --> 01:14:51,588
- [Mr. Lorca] Ha, first blood.

1452
01:14:51,588 --> 01:14:53,288
- [Mr. Lazar] Only fools
talk of fresh blood.

1453
01:14:53,288 --> 01:14:55,621
It's last blood that counts.

1454
01:14:56,497 --> 01:14:58,747
(grunting)

1455
01:15:04,935 --> 01:15:08,294
(swords clanging)

1456
01:15:08,294 --> 01:15:10,311
- Watch my cyclanthera.

1457
01:15:10,311 --> 01:15:11,144
- Sorry.

1458
01:15:13,095 --> 01:15:15,928
(swords clanging)

1459
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:21,608
(grunting)

1460
01:15:21,608 --> 01:15:22,927
- Go Doc, go Doc, go.

1461
01:15:22,927 --> 01:15:26,177
Man, if you can't stab him, nobody can.

1462
01:15:27,192 --> 01:15:29,531
Hell, Doc's my team.

1463
01:15:29,531 --> 01:15:31,781
(grunting)

1464
01:15:34,124 --> 01:15:35,329
- [Mr. Lazar] I have you at last.

1465
01:15:35,329 --> 01:15:38,004
Our rivalry has come to an end.

1466
01:15:38,004 --> 01:15:39,671
And I am the victor!

1467
01:15:41,329 --> 01:15:42,628
(long tone)

1468
01:15:42,628 --> 01:15:45,320
(screaming)

1469
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:46,153
- Doc!

1470
01:15:47,046 --> 01:15:48,936
(screaming)

1471
01:15:48,936 --> 01:15:49,769
- Hold on!

1472
01:15:49,769 --> 01:15:50,686
Hold tight!

1473
01:15:57,631 --> 01:15:59,700
- [Mr. Zorca] Please, my specimens.

1474
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:01,876
Please take care of my specimens.

1475
01:16:01,876 --> 01:16:02,709
- Wait up first.

1476
01:16:02,709 --> 01:16:03,695
I'm taking care of you.

1477
01:16:03,695 --> 01:16:04,528
Come on.

1478
01:16:04,528 --> 01:16:05,454
Climb up, climb over,

1479
01:16:05,454 --> 01:16:06,327
come on.

1480
01:16:06,327 --> 01:16:07,244
- Yes, yes.

1481
01:16:08,252 --> 01:16:09,087
Ahh!

1482
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:09,920
- No, no!

1483
01:16:10,792 --> 01:16:13,125
(screaming)

1484
01:16:14,029 --> 01:16:15,894
- Come on, come on.

1485
01:16:15,894 --> 01:16:16,839
He's gone.

1486
01:16:16,839 --> 01:16:18,395
Where all that fuckin' acid
come from, I don't know.

1487
01:16:18,395 --> 01:16:20,383
But he's gone.

1488
01:16:20,383 --> 01:16:21,521
Come on, let's get the hell out of here.

1489
01:16:21,521 --> 01:16:23,030
- No, beat it.

1490
01:16:23,030 --> 01:16:23,863
- What?

1491
01:16:23,863 --> 01:16:24,696
- You just stay back.

1492
01:16:24,696 --> 01:16:25,529
Stay away from me.

1493
01:16:25,529 --> 01:16:26,362
I mean it!

1494
01:16:26,362 --> 01:16:27,701
- What the hell are you doing?

1495
01:16:27,701 --> 01:16:29,244
- Doc said to take care of his specimens.

1496
01:16:29,244 --> 01:16:30,802
I'm gonna fucking take care of them.

1497
01:16:30,802 --> 01:16:31,635
- What are you trying to do?

1498
01:16:31,635 --> 01:16:32,468
Kill yourself?

1499
01:16:32,468 --> 01:16:33,987
- Just shut up!

1500
01:16:33,987 --> 01:16:35,803
All right, you little bundles of fun.

1501
01:16:35,803 --> 01:16:38,623
I know you can hear me so listen up.

1502
01:16:38,623 --> 01:16:41,246
You know what this is?

1503
01:16:41,246 --> 01:16:42,839
This is the way out.

1504
01:16:42,839 --> 01:16:44,631
You punch this number in
the panel in Doc's chair

1505
01:16:44,631 --> 01:16:46,772
and all the doors open up.

1506
01:16:46,772 --> 01:16:47,605
Come on.

1507
01:16:48,615 --> 01:16:50,975
Now we can all die together.

1508
01:16:50,975 --> 01:16:53,388
Come on, little babies.

1509
01:16:53,388 --> 01:16:54,651
Come on.

1510
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:55,918
That's it.

1511
01:16:55,918 --> 01:16:57,486
That's it.

1512
01:16:57,486 --> 01:16:58,643
Come on.

1513
01:16:58,643 --> 01:17:00,287
One big, happy family.

1514
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:02,586
Come on, you little bundles of fun, you.

1515
01:17:02,586 --> 01:17:03,734
That's it.

1516
01:17:03,734 --> 01:17:05,032
Come on.

1517
01:17:05,032 --> 01:17:07,282
Come on, you little angels.

1518
01:17:09,818 --> 01:17:12,151
(screaming)

1519
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,647
Oh, good fucking riddance.

1520
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:25,336
Well, what are you waiting for?

1521
01:17:25,336 --> 01:17:26,169
Let's go.

1522
01:17:35,787 --> 01:17:37,454
- [Mr. Kantor] Yeow.

1523
01:17:39,882 --> 01:17:40,715
Nasty.

1524
01:17:42,367 --> 01:17:45,164
Looks like I'm not
gettin' paid for this job.

1525
01:17:45,164 --> 01:17:46,843
- You got a car?

1526
01:17:46,843 --> 01:17:50,117
- [Mr. Kantor] Yeah, you
plan on comin' with me?

1527
01:17:50,117 --> 01:17:52,462
- [Sheila] No point stickin' around here.

1528
01:17:52,462 --> 01:17:53,379
No offense.

1529
01:17:54,915 --> 01:17:56,779
Looks like I'm gonna start
hittin' the want ads again.

1530
01:17:56,779 --> 01:17:57,612
- [Mr. Kantor] Jesus.

1531
01:17:57,612 --> 01:18:01,112
- [Sheila] I'm gonna go pack a few things.

1532
01:18:02,342 --> 01:18:05,009
(acid sizzling)

1533
01:18:29,477 --> 01:18:31,636
- Sorry I don't have any
tables to sit on in here.

1534
01:18:31,636 --> 01:18:33,230
Just the usual bench seat.

1535
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:35,195
- I'm adaptable.

1536
01:18:35,195 --> 01:18:40,127
You know, I bet I'd be a
really good private detective.

1537
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:41,387
- You'd be great on surveillance the way

1538
01:18:41,387 --> 01:18:43,994
you just blend right in.

1539
01:18:43,994 --> 01:18:45,665
- Well, I was thinkin'
more along the lines

1540
01:18:45,665 --> 01:18:49,200
of you being the brains,
me being the muscle.

1541
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:53,487
You know, I can be very
loyal to the right employer.

1542
01:18:53,487 --> 01:18:54,737
- So I noticed.

1543
01:19:21,370 --> 01:19:24,370
(suspenseful music)

1544
01:19:26,749 --> 01:19:29,832
(specimen murmuring)

1545
01:19:37,066 --> 01:19:40,899
(dramatic instrumental music)

1546
01:20:47,814 --> 01:20:51,064
(eerie dramatic music)
