00:01:36,986 --> 00:01:38,946
So are we going to Manhattan tonight?

1
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:41,869
OK, so, there's this cute guy I met
on a shoot

2
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:44,376
who I'm kind of trying to fuck...

3
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:48,955
He is either fucking dumb as hell

4
00:01:48,998 --> 00:01:51,500
or he fucking blew his brains out on acid.

5
00:01:51,543 --> 00:01:53,336
Either way it does not matter

6
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:56,193
because he invited me to a party
in Bed Stuy tonight and we're going.

7
00:01:56,236 --> 00:01:58,559
Last time we went to one
of your fancy fashion parties

8
00:01:58,602 --> 00:02:01,068
- I got my fake taken.
- Well, they're not going to card, so…

9
00:02:01,593 --> 00:02:03,179
That's what you said last time!

10
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:04,975
Besides, I told you

11
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,086
Fred's here for that art opening tonight.

12
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:09,601
I thought that was a joke.

13
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:12,271
Wait, what are you talking about?

14
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:15,233
So there's this really cute
guy in my life drawing class

15
00:02:15,482 --> 00:02:17,567
and he's going to this
gallery's opening tonight.

16
00:02:17,817 --> 00:02:19,527
A bunch of people
from his studio are going

17
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:21,864
and he was like, "We should
totally get together later."

18
00:02:21,906 --> 00:02:25,284
We should totally get together
and fuck on the Chinatown bus back.

19
00:02:25,534 --> 00:02:27,286
Ew! I would never do that.

20
00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:31,040
I feel like you'd do it if he asked,
like, maybe once. And really nicely.

21
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,832
Fuck you!

22
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,537
Well, I'm not going to Manhattan, anyway.

23
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,626
Are you serious?

24
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:37,964
- None of the trains are working.
- Wait...

25
00:02:38,713 --> 00:02:39,798
I do know of one party.

26
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:41,550
It's not going to be amazing

27
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,343
but it is, like, a grad party.

28
00:02:43,593 --> 00:02:45,054
There will be alcohol.

29
00:02:45,595 --> 00:02:47,806
- Let's call Fred and go.
- Okay.

30
00:02:49,183 --> 00:02:51,810
- Hey you!
- Hey Anderson!

31
00:02:52,061 --> 00:02:54,396
Wait, come hang with us, please.

32
00:02:54,646 --> 00:02:57,482
- Anderson, let's party.
- We wanna braid your hair.

33
00:02:57,732 --> 00:02:59,484
Guys, stop.

34
00:02:59,734 --> 00:03:02,321
He's thirty years old,
like, get over it, bro.

35
00:03:04,156 --> 00:03:06,117
Whatever. He's being a baby.

36
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,121
- He sucks.
- Like I just wanna hang out.

37
00:03:10,412 --> 00:03:12,331
Stop it. Fucking stop it!

38
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,960
He doesn't know that.

39
00:03:17,877 --> 00:03:19,588
So, is that them?

40
00:03:19,838 --> 00:03:22,049
Yeah. That one's Fred.
He's the one with the glasses.

41
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,519
- Hey.
- What's up?

42
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:37,939
- Michaela?
- Oh, my bad.

43
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,651
This is Fred.
This is Gabby, Riley.

44
00:03:41,901 --> 00:03:43,362
We went to high school together.

45
00:03:43,612 --> 00:03:46,573
Hey what's up. We didn't want
to go inside before you guys got here.

46
00:03:46,823 --> 00:03:50,119
Oh, yeah, that's cool.
I don't know them either. Riley does.

47
00:03:50,369 --> 00:03:52,579
Yeah, they're just some
random people from school.

48
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,292
- Can I bum a cig?
- Yeah for sure.

49
00:03:58,585 --> 00:04:00,087
- You want one?
- No, I'm good.

50
00:04:00,338 --> 00:04:02,214
Riley doesn't smoke.

51
00:04:03,215 --> 00:04:06,093
Word. That's very commendable.

52
00:04:07,053 --> 00:04:10,056
I shouldn't smoke either.
Smoking is bad for you.

53
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:12,058
Yeah, obviously.

54
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,560
- Wait, so you're from Philly too?
- Yeah.

55
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:20,358
I'm just going to school here,
studying Philosophy.

56
00:04:20,857 --> 00:04:23,652
- That's cool.
- She's also super smart. It's crazy.

57
00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:26,405
- It's crazy.
- I'm really not, no.

58
00:04:26,946 --> 00:04:29,866
It's super cool you go to school here.
I'm super jealous.

59
00:04:30,117 --> 00:04:32,786
It's cool, yeah. It's been
a good experience so far.

60
00:04:33,037 --> 00:04:35,955
Can I have a sip of that?
Do you have more?

61
00:04:35,998 --> 00:04:36,998
Okay, cool. Thank you.

62
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:40,502
So are you also a sophomore?

63
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,130
No, Riley's really old.

64
00:04:44,506 --> 00:04:47,967
Ugh, yeah. I'm about to graduate in like,
a week, actually.

65
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:49,552
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

66
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:50,803
Are you scared?

67
00:04:51,721 --> 00:04:53,640
Absolutely terrified.

68
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,604
So you're not from Philly?

69
00:05:00,106 --> 00:05:02,565
No. I'm from Lancaster?

70
00:05:03,483 --> 00:05:04,943
I know where it is.

71
00:05:05,444 --> 00:05:07,071
Riley and I went there

72
00:05:07,321 --> 00:05:09,242
and we dressed up in these
like, colonial dresses

73
00:05:09,365 --> 00:05:11,491
and took pictures churning butter.

74
00:05:11,783 --> 00:05:13,660
It was hilarious.

75
00:05:14,286 --> 00:05:16,579
- Oh, yeah?
- Are you Amish?

76
00:05:18,613 --> 00:05:21,210
Because I don't think you're
allowed to have sex if you're Amish.

77
00:05:21,252 --> 00:05:23,586
Katie, stop it!

78
00:05:23,837 --> 00:05:26,424
I'm so sorry.

79
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:28,508
I'm not Amish.

80
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,428
Obviously.

81
00:05:30,677 --> 00:05:32,762
Have you ever seen an Amish Asian?

82
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,015
- Asian Amish?
- I don't know!

83
00:05:36,975 --> 00:05:38,727
Okay, I'm gonna get another beer.

84
00:05:38,977 --> 00:05:40,770
- Do you want anything?
- No. I'm good.

85
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,274
Okay. Katie? Yeah, okay.

86
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,070
Yo. I came.

87
00:05:49,612 --> 00:05:51,948
- Oh yeah. What's up?
- I just need to get in here.

88
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,285
I just saw some friends
of yours a second ago.

89
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:56,370
Oh, yeah?

90
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:58,538
Yeah. They're pretty funny.

91
00:05:59,096 --> 00:06:02,309
They showed me this dance
you came up with in high school.

92
00:06:02,351 --> 00:06:03,463
Uh huh...

93
00:06:04,753 --> 00:06:06,546
Oh my God, stop. No.

94
00:06:06,796 --> 00:06:08,673
They're so ridiculous.

95
00:06:13,845 --> 00:06:15,347
So, who is that guy you're with?

96
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:17,932
His name is Leo.

97
00:06:18,184 --> 00:06:20,059
He's from Philly.

98
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,147
Are you, like, dating?

99
00:06:26,107 --> 00:06:27,485
Um, I don't know.

100
00:06:28,818 --> 00:06:30,779
I mean I just met him...

101
00:06:31,988 --> 00:06:33,948
But, he's really cool.

102
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:36,202
Thanks.

103
00:06:39,455 --> 00:06:41,499
- Are you okay?
- Mhmm... yeah.

104
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,878
I just realized something.

105
00:06:47,128 --> 00:06:48,214
What?

106
00:06:50,006 --> 00:06:52,926
Everyone in movies dies the same way.

107
00:06:54,093 --> 00:06:55,179
They're like…

108
00:07:12,488 --> 00:07:14,573
But in real life they're just still.

109
00:07:16,492 --> 00:07:18,202
They just die.

110
00:07:27,461 --> 00:07:29,463
Do you want to, like...?

111
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,841
Yeah, sure. I just...

112
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,635
I could, like... use my tongue?

113
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,180
I mean, I could use my mouth...

114
00:07:39,431 --> 00:07:41,099
like I could give you a blowjob.

115
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:43,643
- Um, you don't have to...
- No, no, no

116
00:07:43,893 --> 00:07:45,770
It's cool. I want to.

117
00:07:58,783 --> 00:08:00,785
Oh, I'm on the pill, so...

118
00:08:01,995 --> 00:08:04,163
Yeah, but... I just want
to be safe, you know?

119
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,838
Okay.

120
00:08:12,088 --> 00:08:13,591
So what are you going to do after?

121
00:08:14,592 --> 00:08:16,594
I don't know.

122
00:08:17,927 --> 00:08:19,846
I was going to move to Seattle

123
00:08:20,179 --> 00:08:22,056
but that isn't happening anymore.

124
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,726
And I haven't thought
of anything cooler to do.

125
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:28,938
Why Seattle?

126
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,610
My ex is from there
and his parents are there

127
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:34,694
and he wanted to be close to them.

128
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:39,949
How long were you guys together?

129
00:08:40,241 --> 00:08:42,160
Since freshman year...

130
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:44,288
so like, more than three years.

131
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:50,294
That's so unimaginable to me.

132
00:08:51,127 --> 00:08:53,464
What? How long we were together for?

133
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:54,714
Yeah.

134
00:08:57,551 --> 00:09:00,304
I had a boyfriend for
most of high school too, so.

135
00:09:00,845 --> 00:09:03,307
I guess I'm very relationship-y.

136
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:06,100
I don't know,

137
00:09:06,352 --> 00:09:08,102
that sounds so intense to me.

138
00:09:09,355 --> 00:09:10,397
Yeah

139
00:09:10,648 --> 00:09:12,857
I don't know.

140
00:09:13,107 --> 00:09:14,984
It's better than what I'm doing now...

141
00:09:16,235 --> 00:09:18,196
which is... like, not much of anything.

142
00:09:20,865 --> 00:09:22,368
What happened to you guys?

143
00:09:28,164 --> 00:09:30,166
I cheated on him...

144
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:33,795
with this, like, really hot
male model... who...

145
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:36,756
What?

146
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:39,968
No. I'm sorry.

147
00:09:40,719 --> 00:09:42,721
I don't know why I said that.

148
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:47,100
No, the truth is that

149
00:09:47,393 --> 00:09:49,478
actually he cheated on me.

150
00:09:50,186 --> 00:09:52,188
He, like, left me.

151
00:09:54,148 --> 00:09:55,942
Is this weird to talk about?

152
00:09:56,527 --> 00:09:58,529
No. I mean, I don't care.

153
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,292
Well, okay. I mean I can
tell you what happened.

154
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,212
So, we were in
our senior year, first semester.

155
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:18,131
And he took this finance class.

156
00:10:19,048 --> 00:10:20,967
I guess he wanted to
do something practical

157
00:10:21,217 --> 00:10:23,845
because he was a
Comparative Literature major.

158
00:10:25,764 --> 00:10:26,806
At the beginning

159
00:10:27,056 --> 00:10:28,850
it was just this weird inside joke we had,

160
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,852
that he was turning into

161
00:10:31,102 --> 00:10:32,979
this alt-right frat guy.

162
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:37,025
I don't know, he starts
getting really into it.

163
00:10:37,776 --> 00:10:39,944
He's talking about the stocks and the Dow

164
00:10:40,903 --> 00:10:44,032
and he's going to these lectures
and meetings and I don't know.

165
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:47,201
It was so weird

166
00:10:47,994 --> 00:10:50,497
because I never saw him
hanging out in this world.

167
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,460
And then he started
hanging out more and more

168
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,587
with this one girl.

169
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:59,297
And I don't know.

170
00:10:59,548 --> 00:11:01,340
Maybe in retrospect I felt uncomfortable

171
00:11:01,592 --> 00:11:03,469
but in the moment

172
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,304
I don't remember
feeling anything but fine.

173
00:11:08,264 --> 00:11:09,641
And then

174
00:11:12,935 --> 00:11:14,937
one day he's like,

175
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,692
“Riley, I just..."

176
00:11:21,737 --> 00:11:23,739
"I don't..."

177
00:11:26,365 --> 00:11:29,160
You don't have to talk about it.

178
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,204
No no no,

179
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,372
the thing is I do.

180
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,462
Because it's like this story
that's still interesting to me

181
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,632
because I can't quite make sense of it.

182
00:11:43,382 --> 00:11:44,676
But he said,

183
00:11:44,926 --> 00:11:47,303
"Riley, I met this other girl

184
00:11:51,475 --> 00:11:54,018
and I swear to you that
nothing has happened yet

185
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,187
but I think something will,

186
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,732
and I think I need to pursue it."

187
00:11:59,315 --> 00:12:01,317
I mean what do you say to that?

188
00:12:02,276 --> 00:12:03,945
And that was it..

189
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:07,448
What an asshole.

190
00:12:08,074 --> 00:12:10,076
I mean, yeah, duh.

191
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:16,290
But I don't even completely blame him.

192
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:20,546
Because this girl is going
to make so much fucking money.

193
00:12:21,505 --> 00:12:23,381
And she goes on runs

194
00:12:23,632 --> 00:12:25,634
and plants trees for the community

195
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:29,680
and... I have nothing going on post-grad.

196
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:32,431
I'm even getting kicked
out of this fucking apartment.

197
00:12:36,227 --> 00:12:37,604
I don't know.

198
00:12:38,062 --> 00:12:40,064
Now I'm thinking I just
need to get out of here.

199
00:12:41,357 --> 00:12:43,694
Maybe I'll be lame
and move back to Philly.

200
00:12:45,444 --> 00:12:46,905
That would be cool.

201
00:12:47,573 --> 00:12:48,573
Yeah?

202
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,325
It feels so sad to move back home though.

203
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:55,539
You could get your own apartment.

204
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,458
That's true.

205
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,587
I guess I hadn't thought about that.

206
00:13:02,671 --> 00:13:05,089
I mean, it's no New York,

207
00:13:06,215 --> 00:13:08,217
but there's a lot of cool shit going on.

208
00:13:09,427 --> 00:13:11,429
Yeah, that's true.

209
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:14,307
And my family's there...

210
00:13:15,016 --> 00:13:17,018
and Gabby and Michaela...

211
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:18,812
and you.

212
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,731
That's true.

213
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:23,274
I'll be there.

214
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:38,414
Sorry I had to dip early.

215
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:40,541
I had to catch a bus back.

216
00:13:40,876 --> 00:13:41,960
No worries.

217
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:44,128
When are you going to be back in NYC?

218
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,798
Lol. I don't know.

219
00:13:47,048 --> 00:13:48,048
Probably not for a while.

220
00:13:48,257 --> 00:13:49,550
I've got mad work.

221
00:13:58,392 --> 00:13:59,853
Okay, do you see that?

222
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:01,145
Yeah?

223
00:14:01,187 --> 00:14:02,981
That, like, V-shape her stomach is making?

224
00:14:03,231 --> 00:14:05,107
That's because she got her ribs removed.

225
00:14:05,524 --> 00:14:06,735
I mean…

226
00:14:06,985 --> 00:14:08,779
It's, like, what everyone's
doing right now.

227
00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:10,781
I feel like she might just work out a lot.

228
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,115
No, I'm telling you, it's
physically impossible

229
00:14:13,366 --> 00:14:14,701
to have a body like that.

230
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:16,787
Riley, do you know Tasha?

231
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:19,998
Yeah, I met her once at a party.

232
00:14:20,331 --> 00:14:22,333
Oh my God, she's so pretty...

233
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:24,920
Wei? Mama?

234
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:26,835
Hi. Yeah. Okay, so... yeah.

235
00:14:29,173 --> 00:14:31,300
I have that yeast infection again.

236
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,928
It just came back.

237
00:14:33,552 --> 00:14:35,554
Yeah, it's really bad.

238
00:14:36,157 --> 00:14:37,180
I don't know,

239
00:14:37,223 --> 00:14:39,726
because I'm stressed or something?
I don't know.

240
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,398
Yeah, I tried to get an appointment

241
00:14:45,691 --> 00:14:47,149
but they're really full.

242
00:14:47,192 --> 00:14:49,157
Can you write me
a prescription for that cream,

243
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,034
that steroid cream, again?

244
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,322
No, I know, okay?

245
00:14:53,364 --> 00:14:55,241
Please, can you just do it?
It's really bad.

246
00:14:56,534 --> 00:14:57,869
Yeah, for the pharmacy

247
00:14:58,119 --> 00:14:59,997
at the university hospital.

248
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,541
Yeah. Yeah.

249
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:05,669
Thank you. Alright. Bye.

250
00:15:13,969 --> 00:15:15,971
Hello! Hello!

251
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,807
- Hi!
- Sorry I'm late.

252
00:15:19,515 --> 00:15:21,517
What's up?

253
00:15:24,645 --> 00:15:26,564
Um... I somehow have the world's worst

254
00:15:26,815 --> 00:15:27,941
yeast infection?

255
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,943
Yeah, I can smell it from here..

256
00:15:30,192 --> 00:15:31,903
Fuck you!

257
00:15:32,696 --> 00:15:34,613
It's because you eat too much bread.

258
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:36,615
Literally what?

259
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:38,076
All that yeast.

260
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:40,369
Okay, I know what you're thinking

261
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:42,621
- and it's not the same kind of yeast.
- Yes it is!

262
00:15:42,663 --> 00:15:46,459
There's a woman at MIT who is literally
making yogurt with her vagina yeast.

263
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:48,712
Okay, I read that same article

264
00:15:48,962 --> 00:15:50,714
and it's not the yeast,

265
00:15:50,964 --> 00:15:53,008
it's the cultures or whatever.

266
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:55,093
Would you eat it?

267
00:15:57,219 --> 00:15:58,805
Vagina yogurt?

268
00:15:59,056 --> 00:16:00,932
I don't know.

269
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:03,601
Maybe if you didn't tell me beforehand.

270
00:16:04,936 --> 00:16:06,228
What?

271
00:16:06,772 --> 00:16:08,647
I don't know actually...

272
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:10,691
because it's just like
the cultures, right?

273
00:16:10,942 --> 00:16:12,693
Like, how big are they?

274
00:16:12,944 --> 00:16:14,695
I think they're, like, really small.

275
00:16:14,946 --> 00:16:16,823
Like, they're pretty much unseeable.

276
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,788
I saw David today.

277
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:25,999
- Did you say anything?
- No

278
00:16:27,156 --> 00:16:28,991
We just ignored each other.

279
00:16:29,241 --> 00:16:31,577
Or maybe I saw him and he didn't see me.

280
00:16:33,788 --> 00:16:35,706
- Are you okay?
- Yeah!

281
00:16:35,957 --> 00:16:37,751
Yeah. I'm fine.

282
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,878
It's, like, what you expect, right?

283
00:16:40,294 --> 00:16:42,296
Sorry. Someone's texting me.

284
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,131
- What's up?
- Hm?

285
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:47,009
Who are you texting?

286
00:16:47,928 --> 00:16:49,846
Just this guy Tom Wachowski?

287
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:51,890
He's in my Philosophy cohort.

288
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:53,140
Do you know him?

289
00:16:53,182 --> 00:16:55,059
- Wachowski?
- Yeah.

290
00:16:55,852 --> 00:16:58,437
He kind of wants to
hang out if you're down.

291
00:17:00,982 --> 00:17:03,234
Depends. Where?

292
00:17:05,904 --> 00:17:07,948
Bed Stuy?

293
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:10,658
- No. That's too far.
- Okay. Yeah.

294
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:12,159
You're right. You right.

295
00:17:13,912 --> 00:17:15,830
Well, I'm starting
to get kind of hungry...

296
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,249
What if we just met up in the middle?

297
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,584
Why does everyone always say that?

298
00:17:20,835 --> 00:17:22,628
It's more inconvenient for both people.

299
00:17:22,879 --> 00:17:24,755
No, okay, you're right.

300
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:31,220
So...

301
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,840
where do you want to get food?

302
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,930
I don't know. The bar he's at has food.

303
00:17:40,187 --> 00:17:42,106
Riley. Who even tries to fuck someone

304
00:17:42,356 --> 00:17:44,233
at the end of their last semester?

305
00:17:44,608 --> 00:17:46,568
That is like, beyond...

306
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,031
- Desperate?
- Desperate?

307
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:52,074
Yeah.

308
00:17:52,324 --> 00:17:54,201
I don't know.

309
00:17:55,661 --> 00:17:57,663
I guess we're both just
really bored or something.

310
00:17:59,623 --> 00:18:01,083
I don't know...

311
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:10,301
Hey!

312
00:18:11,093 --> 00:18:12,720
So what you're saying is Asians

313
00:18:12,971 --> 00:18:15,264
shouldn't be considered
for affirmative action?

314
00:18:15,764 --> 00:18:18,117
I mean, I guess I've been
skirting around it a little bit...

315
00:18:18,141 --> 00:18:19,600
Skirting around it?

316
00:18:19,643 --> 00:18:21,115
I'm just saying that

317
00:18:21,158 --> 00:18:23,623
I think they've been afforded
a lot of opportunities already...

318
00:18:23,647 --> 00:18:25,357
Opportunities? To do what?

319
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:27,526
Be in internment camps
and build railroads?

320
00:18:27,776 --> 00:18:29,528
Oh, don't bring up stuff that happened

321
00:18:29,778 --> 00:18:32,799
- like a hundred years ago to a tiny subset...
- Don't bring up literal history

322
00:18:32,823 --> 00:18:34,158
and generational trauma?

323
00:18:34,408 --> 00:18:35,701
You know what I mean!

324
00:18:35,952 --> 00:18:37,703
No I don't. So why don't you tell me?

325
00:18:37,954 --> 00:18:39,705
- In our society...
- Okay,

326
00:18:39,956 --> 00:18:41,123
so if an immigrant comes here

327
00:18:41,373 --> 00:18:43,125
and has to work super hard at like,

328
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,668
a fast food restaurant

329
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:46,670
and their kid has to learn English

330
00:18:46,713 --> 00:18:49,330
they should be denied
the benefit of affirmative action?

331
00:18:49,373 --> 00:18:51,680
Like, they haven't already
been given enough?

332
00:18:51,723 --> 00:18:53,723
That's such a niche example.

333
00:18:54,636 --> 00:18:56,263
It happens all the time!

334
00:18:56,306 --> 00:18:58,473
Yeah, but there are white people,
poor white people,

335
00:18:58,515 --> 00:19:00,267
in literally the exact same

336
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,062
- socioeconomic situation.
- Everyone

337
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:04,456
- always wants to bring up white people!
- That have to work hard too to overcome...

338
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,648
yeah because if you do
it weakens your argument

339
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,650
whereas if you don't it lacks inclusivity.

340
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:11,653
White people are already included!

341
00:19:13,073 --> 00:19:14,490
Oh shit. You okay?

342
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,617
Hey, do you want to go home?

343
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:18,202
I can take her home.

344
00:19:18,452 --> 00:19:19,954
No, no, guys.

345
00:19:21,872 --> 00:19:23,707
It's, like, totally chill.

346
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:28,628
I'm just going to use
the bathroom really quick...

347
00:19:28,796 --> 00:19:30,131
if you want to scooch out.

348
00:19:30,174 --> 00:19:32,504
I'm just going to use the bathroom
and I'll be right back.

349
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:33,842
Seriously. Yeah.

350
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,851
Hey. Where's Tom?

351
00:19:43,144 --> 00:19:45,270
- I told him to go home.
- What, why?

352
00:19:46,147 --> 00:19:47,564
Because you need to go home.

353
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:49,650
I need to go home.

354
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,527
We need to go home.

355
00:19:52,903 --> 00:19:54,863
I still have to pay though.

356
00:19:55,115 --> 00:19:56,115
I already did.

357
00:19:56,698 --> 00:19:58,617
What? Katie!

358
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:00,619
- I'll request you tomorrow.
- Thank you!

359
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:02,621
You are the best!

360
00:20:02,871 --> 00:20:04,748
I know. I know...

361
00:20:44,413 --> 00:20:46,415
- Hey!
- Yo!

362
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,710
- How's it going?
- I'm, like, so fucking hungover.

363
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,172
- How are you?
- I finally finished.

364
00:20:55,924 --> 00:20:57,926
- Wait, what's today's date?
- The fourth.

365
00:20:58,899 --> 00:21:01,124
Give me that. What did you write about?

366
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:03,545
I wrote about the principle of bivalence,
comparing it to...

367
00:21:03,682 --> 00:21:05,434
And you picked the hardest prompt.

368
00:21:05,684 --> 00:21:07,725
- Fuck you, man!
- Hey! It's not the hardest prompt.

369
00:21:09,022 --> 00:21:10,939
It does have the most sources.

370
00:21:11,191 --> 00:21:13,400
Oh my God! What the fuck is wrong with me?

371
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,777
- Seriously! I'm so screwed.
- Hey!

372
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:17,488
You've still got a few hours.

373
00:21:17,738 --> 00:21:20,491
Yeah, so?
I have my intro and conclusion done.

374
00:21:20,741 --> 00:21:22,326
You've still got time!

375
00:21:22,576 --> 00:21:24,870
I heard you the first time! So...?

376
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:27,361
Have you heard of this really
cool thing called Adderall?

377
00:21:28,457 --> 00:21:30,501
Hey. Can you Venmo me
when you get the chance??

378
00:21:30,918 --> 00:21:31,918
Also

379
00:21:32,045 --> 00:21:33,837
I accidentally gave
you a 25 milligram pill,

380
00:21:34,088 --> 00:21:36,381
so it might be a little strong.
Just FYI.

381
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,767
- Hey Riley.
- Oh my God. Hi!

382
00:21:47,017 --> 00:21:48,560
- What's up?
- How are you?

383
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,562
- Good. How are you?
- Fine.

384
00:21:50,812 --> 00:21:52,564
I was sort of hoping you'd come by.

385
00:21:52,814 --> 00:21:54,858
- Oh, yeah?
- Do you have a minute to chat?

386
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:56,236
Oh, yeah, sure.

387
00:21:56,485 --> 00:21:57,945
Do you want to go to my office?

388
00:21:59,072 --> 00:22:01,115
Oh, okay. Yeah.

389
00:22:05,245 --> 00:22:06,912
Have a seat wherever.

390
00:22:07,704 --> 00:22:09,623
Do you want water or anything?

391
00:22:09,873 --> 00:22:11,667
A gross Keurig coffee?

392
00:22:11,917 --> 00:22:13,438
- No, I'm good, thanks.
- Are you sure?

393
00:22:13,627 --> 00:22:15,629
- It's no trouble.
- No, I'm really good. Thanks.

394
00:22:16,162 --> 00:22:18,590
I don't know why it's still
so hot in here all the time,

395
00:22:18,632 --> 00:22:21,261
it makes me feel like I'm having
heat flashes twenty-four-seven.

396
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,387
- That sucks.
- Yeah...

397
00:22:24,513 --> 00:22:26,473
OK... well...

398
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:33,141
so I just... this is sort
of difficult to talk about.

399
00:22:33,981 --> 00:22:35,691
But, I'm a little worried.

400
00:22:36,024 --> 00:22:38,278
I just read your last paper,

401
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:41,446
and because it was late,
and because of the quality,

402
00:22:41,697 --> 00:22:43,657
I had to give you a failing grade.

403
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,954
Oh. I guess I didn't think
my argument was amazing, but-

404
00:22:48,997 --> 00:22:52,083
Well, I have to be honest, it seemed like
you used more of the Sparknotes

405
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,751
instead of finding the actual
nuances of the essays.

406
00:22:55,085 --> 00:22:57,087
- Oh, I read the essays.
- Okay.

407
00:22:57,713 --> 00:22:59,674
I definitely wouldn't do that.
I wouldn't do that.

408
00:22:59,881 --> 00:23:01,675
I believe you. And I know,

409
00:23:01,925 --> 00:23:03,427
I know you've had a tough semester.

410
00:23:03,677 --> 00:23:05,804
But, at the moment, you're barely passing.

411
00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:07,472
I'm worried.

412
00:23:15,022 --> 00:23:17,317
What will happen if I don't pass?

413
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:20,402
You'll have to repeat the course
for credit over the summer,

414
00:23:20,652 --> 00:23:22,696
which I teach at the Brooklyn campus.

415
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:27,451
- Can I still walk?
- Excuse me?

416
00:23:28,202 --> 00:23:30,746
Like, will I be able
to walk at graduation?

417
00:23:30,996 --> 00:23:33,790
My parents are going to be
really upset if I can't do that.

418
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:37,502
I think that's something
to discuss with your academic advisor.

419
00:23:37,878 --> 00:23:39,796
But what I'm more concerned about

420
00:23:40,088 --> 00:23:43,050
is the fact that you don't seem
passionate about this material.

421
00:23:44,635 --> 00:23:46,220
I remember you as a freshman.

422
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,805
You were so vibrant and talkative and...

423
00:23:50,807 --> 00:23:54,395
I just would hate to see this
stupid adult stuff beat you down.

424
00:23:56,813 --> 00:23:58,732
I'm not beaten down.

425
00:23:58,982 --> 00:24:00,442
Right, of course,

426
00:24:00,692 --> 00:24:01,985
that was a poor choice of words.

427
00:24:02,236 --> 00:24:03,987
- What I mean is...
- Sorry.

428
00:24:04,238 --> 00:24:06,031
I just turned in my essay, right?

429
00:24:06,282 --> 00:24:07,741
And I think it's pretty good.

430
00:24:07,991 --> 00:24:09,576
I mean, maybe not great.

431
00:24:09,826 --> 00:24:11,307
But I think it's good enough to pass.

432
00:24:11,536 --> 00:24:12,579
Okay.

433
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:15,040
I look forward to reading it, then.

434
00:24:17,084 --> 00:24:19,086
So, to change the subject...

435
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:23,131
What's post-grad looking like?

436
00:24:24,508 --> 00:24:26,051
- Oh, ha.
- What?

437
00:24:27,345 --> 00:24:29,805
I don't know. I guess just the way
you were talking about it

438
00:24:30,055 --> 00:24:31,973
made it seem, like,
this exciting prospect.

439
00:24:32,225 --> 00:24:34,025
Well, did you apply to
any of the fellowships

440
00:24:34,227 --> 00:24:35,936
or the post-grad programs

441
00:24:36,186 --> 00:24:37,604
I put on the listserv?

442
00:24:37,854 --> 00:24:39,606
Remember we were talking about

443
00:24:39,856 --> 00:24:41,733
you applying to that fellowship in Denver?

444
00:24:42,526 --> 00:24:43,860
Yeah...

445
00:24:44,111 --> 00:24:46,071
I was going to apply...

446
00:24:46,655 --> 00:24:48,656
but then... short answer
for all of that: I didn't.

447
00:24:48,824 --> 00:24:50,701
I was going to apply. But I did not.

448
00:24:51,452 --> 00:24:53,454
There's always next year.

449
00:24:57,916 --> 00:24:59,918
Yeah, totally...

450
00:25:02,338 --> 00:25:04,257
So I actually have a seminar starting,

451
00:25:04,506 --> 00:25:06,925
like, right now. So I have to get going.

452
00:25:07,175 --> 00:25:08,386
I'm sorry. I'm just in a rush.

453
00:25:08,635 --> 00:25:10,595
Can we continue this
discussion some time, Riley?

454
00:25:10,637 --> 00:25:12,390
When you have more time?

455
00:25:12,681 --> 00:25:14,057
Yeah, yeah. For sure.

456
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,017
Thank you for letting me know.

457
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,019
I'll see you in class.

458
00:25:18,354 --> 00:25:20,230
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

459
00:25:50,844 --> 00:25:52,513
I loved that painting you posted.

460
00:25:52,763 --> 00:25:54,055
It's super cool.

461
00:25:54,307 --> 00:25:56,016
Sorry, I just saw this.

462
00:25:56,266 --> 00:25:58,143
Thanks. It turned out super cool.

463
00:25:58,727 --> 00:26:00,228
Yeah. It's awesome.

464
00:26:00,521 --> 00:26:02,022
How are you doing?

465
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:17,913
So we don't handle graduation tickets,

466
00:26:18,163 --> 00:26:19,415
that's this guy Marty Doyer.

467
00:26:19,664 --> 00:26:21,417
D as in dog,

468
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:24,044
O, Y, E, R.

469
00:26:24,087 --> 00:26:25,210
Yeah, exactly.

470
00:26:25,253 --> 00:26:27,714
So you need to email him
about getting more tickets.

471
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:30,343
His e-mail is m.doyer...

472
00:26:31,511 --> 00:26:32,636
not a problem.

473
00:26:33,011 --> 00:26:35,305
You as well. Bye bye!

474
00:26:36,681 --> 00:26:39,352
- "Bye bye!"
- You're so dumb.

475
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,187
I am so bored.

476
00:26:42,438 --> 00:26:43,438
Same.

477
00:26:43,564 --> 00:26:45,315
I will do any job

478
00:26:45,566 --> 00:26:47,275
after I graduate

479
00:26:47,527 --> 00:26:49,367
as long as it doesn't
involve looking at Gmail

480
00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:51,447
for the entire day.

481
00:26:54,534 --> 00:26:56,536
That's any job we're ever going to get.

482
00:27:01,331 --> 00:27:03,250
Do you wanna get boba after work?

483
00:27:03,834 --> 00:27:05,836
I mean, sure.

484
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,422
Since when do you like boba?

485
00:27:08,713 --> 00:27:10,799
I don't really know if I do.

486
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:12,634
But I see every other Asian person

487
00:27:12,677 --> 00:27:13,842
on campus drinking it

488
00:27:13,885 --> 00:27:15,345
and I feel excluded.

489
00:27:16,888 --> 00:27:18,306
It's really bad for you.

490
00:27:20,267 --> 00:27:22,269
How is that even possible?

491
00:27:22,603 --> 00:27:24,605
I had a dentist who was Chinese

492
00:27:24,896 --> 00:27:28,108
and he could literally tell when one of
his patients had too much bubble tea

493
00:27:28,358 --> 00:27:29,438
because it would literally,

494
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,361
like, rip out their molars.

495
00:27:31,612 --> 00:27:33,196
That sticky stuff.

496
00:27:33,447 --> 00:27:35,323
- What, the tapioca?
- Yeah.

497
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,495
Maybe not then.

498
00:27:44,249 --> 00:27:45,876
I just remembered.

499
00:27:46,126 --> 00:27:47,587
My brother and I used to call him

500
00:27:47,836 --> 00:27:49,337
"Doctor Wonton."

501
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,633
What?

502
00:27:53,174 --> 00:27:55,927
My brother and I used to call
that dentist Doctor Wonton.

503
00:27:56,177 --> 00:27:58,805
I was trying to remember his real name
and I couldn't...

504
00:28:03,393 --> 00:28:05,770
Why do you think you called him that?

505
00:28:06,396 --> 00:28:07,814
I dunno...

506
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,774
I guess 'cause he was Chinese.

507
00:28:34,758 --> 00:28:36,760
- Hey.
- Hey.

508
00:28:37,595 --> 00:28:39,804
I didn't know you were home today.

509
00:28:40,556 --> 00:28:42,475
Yeah...

510
00:28:42,724 --> 00:28:44,602
My boss is letting me edit from here.

511
00:28:45,185 --> 00:28:48,813
Our side of the office is getting
a new coat of paint today.

512
00:28:49,064 --> 00:28:51,107
Hell yeah for telecommuting.

513
00:28:52,025 --> 00:28:53,025
Oh, yeah.

514
00:28:53,234 --> 00:28:54,819
Are you still working on that thing

515
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,656
about the cult in Bushwick?

516
00:28:56,905 --> 00:28:58,658
No, we just got

517
00:28:58,907 --> 00:29:00,241
picture lock on that.

518
00:29:01,076 --> 00:29:02,994
We're moving onto the future

519
00:29:03,244 --> 00:29:04,245
of weed lubes.

520
00:29:05,121 --> 00:29:07,123
- Nice.
- Yeah.

521
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:12,630
Hey, I think we should talk.

522
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:14,756
Yeah? What's up?

523
00:29:16,091 --> 00:29:19,177
I've been trying to think about
the right way to bring this up, but...

524
00:29:20,178 --> 00:29:21,514
Yeah. What's going on?

525
00:29:21,763 --> 00:29:23,641
I just need to come out and say it.

526
00:29:25,934 --> 00:29:27,894
Okay, so say it.

527
00:29:30,188 --> 00:29:33,483
Okay. I'd appreciate it if
you weren't just around

528
00:29:34,652 --> 00:29:37,070
in your underwear anymore.

529
00:29:39,573 --> 00:29:41,199
Wait, what?

530
00:29:42,117 --> 00:29:45,538
I know we said that nothing
should change after we...

531
00:29:45,787 --> 00:29:47,665
you know...

532
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:51,376
- Had sex?
- Yeah.

533
00:29:51,627 --> 00:29:53,503
- Yeah?!
- But...

534
00:29:55,422 --> 00:29:57,340
I guess it's kind of confusing for me now

535
00:29:57,591 --> 00:29:59,467
because I...

536
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:01,803
I don't know. It's just confusing.

537
00:30:05,181 --> 00:30:07,058
It feels like maybe you want

538
00:30:07,308 --> 00:30:09,310
to have something happen again.

539
00:30:11,229 --> 00:30:12,522
What about me,

540
00:30:12,773 --> 00:30:14,524
like, slumped over after not showering,

541
00:30:14,775 --> 00:30:17,255
equals I'm trying to fuck you again?

542
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,445
Not necessarily-

543
00:30:18,696 --> 00:30:20,905
Like, I didn't even know
you were home today, right?

544
00:30:21,156 --> 00:30:22,677
Yeah. I'm not talking about right now.

545
00:30:22,866 --> 00:30:24,744
It's other times.

546
00:30:25,285 --> 00:30:27,705
- What other times?
- Like, all the time!

547
00:30:27,954 --> 00:30:29,594
Like when you're going to the bathroom...

548
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,125
Okay, why are you
looking at me like that then?

549
00:30:33,043 --> 00:30:35,045
I don't want to make this a big deal.

550
00:30:35,462 --> 00:30:36,921
I was just thinking to myself...

551
00:30:37,172 --> 00:30:38,591
what if I brought a girl over

552
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,593
and she sees you

553
00:30:40,842 --> 00:30:43,637
all around the apartment
in your underwear.

554
00:30:44,054 --> 00:30:46,347
It's not the most ideal image.

555
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:47,891
What girl?

556
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:51,436
A hypothetical girl.

557
00:30:51,687 --> 00:30:52,979
A woman.

558
00:30:55,775 --> 00:30:56,776
Sure.

559
00:30:57,818 --> 00:30:58,904
Think about it.

560
00:30:58,947 --> 00:31:01,319
She just sees you, like,
laying around in your underwear

561
00:31:01,362 --> 00:31:04,240
and you're all cool
and casual about it like,

562
00:31:04,658 --> 00:31:06,951
"Hey, I'm Riley. I'm Anderson's roommate!"

563
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:09,747
She'd probably be like,
"Who's that girl?”

564
00:31:10,455 --> 00:31:11,956
You know?

565
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:16,336
Yeah. I guess.

566
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,089
Is that cool?

567
00:31:20,965 --> 00:31:22,967
Yeah sure.

568
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:26,012
So, you want me to put pants on,

569
00:31:26,888 --> 00:31:28,306
like, this instant?

570
00:31:28,973 --> 00:31:30,975
That would be preferable.

571
00:31:36,606 --> 00:31:37,606
Excuse me.

572
00:31:43,613 --> 00:31:45,532
You must, like,

573
00:31:45,783 --> 00:31:48,201
really think a lot about yourself.

574
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:51,454
Excuse me?

575
00:31:51,496 --> 00:31:54,624
You think that because we had sex one time

576
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:56,376
that I'm now in love with you

577
00:31:56,626 --> 00:31:58,378
and everything I do

578
00:31:58,628 --> 00:32:00,505
is an attempt to like, woo you

579
00:32:01,422 --> 00:32:02,549
I don't think that.

580
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,844
You obviously think you're hot shit

581
00:32:05,093 --> 00:32:07,888
if you see me in my two-year-old
sagging granny panties

582
00:32:08,138 --> 00:32:10,265
that my grandpa literally
sent me from China

583
00:32:10,515 --> 00:32:13,184
and you're like,
"Wow, Riley is so horny for me."

584
00:32:13,434 --> 00:32:15,813
I literally didn't say any of that.

585
00:32:16,062 --> 00:32:17,898
But that's what you're implying!

586
00:32:18,774 --> 00:32:20,693
You're really blowing
this out of proportion.

587
00:32:20,942 --> 00:32:22,360
No. I'm not!

588
00:32:23,111 --> 00:32:24,404
God!

589
00:32:24,654 --> 00:32:26,489
I knew you wanted to sleep with me

590
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,491
before David and I even broke up

591
00:32:28,534 --> 00:32:31,285
and I was just like, doing some
fucked up wish fulfillment for you

592
00:32:31,327 --> 00:32:34,122
and now you're, like, actually delusional.

593
00:32:34,664 --> 00:32:36,666
- Actually delusional.
- You're really...

594
00:32:38,001 --> 00:32:39,627
That's really...

595
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:41,922
You're such a...

596
00:32:44,465 --> 00:32:45,718
Such a what?

597
00:32:50,346 --> 00:32:52,348
This is your last month!

598
00:32:57,353 --> 00:32:59,773
- Wait, what?
- You heard me.

599
00:33:00,481 --> 00:33:01,481
You gotta move out.

600
00:33:01,691 --> 00:33:04,235
I... I can't live with you anymore.

601
00:33:04,485 --> 00:33:06,529
You're such a... millennial!

602
00:33:09,616 --> 00:33:11,618
You're kicking me out

603
00:33:12,118 --> 00:33:14,037
because I'm a millennial?

604
00:33:14,287 --> 00:33:15,413
No.

605
00:33:15,663 --> 00:33:18,708
I'm kicking you out because of your energy

606
00:33:19,334 --> 00:33:21,252
and your constant partying

607
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:24,088
and thinking nothing,
like, has any consequences.

608
00:33:24,339 --> 00:33:26,926
You treat everything
as if it's disposable.

609
00:33:27,801 --> 00:33:29,803
You make me feel disposable.

610
00:33:32,305 --> 00:33:34,307
No, I mean,

611
00:33:35,725 --> 00:33:38,561
I obviously don't think you're disposable.

612
00:33:38,812 --> 00:33:40,271
I'm sorry.

613
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,149
- I just said that out of anger.
- Yeah.

614
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:45,235
But that's the problem.

615
00:33:45,485 --> 00:33:47,320
You just lashed out at me.

616
00:33:48,906 --> 00:33:50,698
And honestly, like,

617
00:33:51,366 --> 00:33:53,368
I let you live here because of David,

618
00:33:54,118 --> 00:33:56,329
and his brother and I
don't work together anymore

619
00:33:56,579 --> 00:33:58,581
and you two aren't even friends so...

620
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:01,877
I don't have any loyalty to you.

621
00:34:04,964 --> 00:34:06,966
Okay. Fine.

622
00:34:08,091 --> 00:34:10,635
Look, I'm sorry it had
to be like this... but...

623
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:17,350
- But what?!
- I don't know.

624
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:20,436
I don't know how to finish that sentence.

625
00:34:20,687 --> 00:34:23,273
I just started it because
it sounds like something people say.

626
00:34:30,571 --> 00:34:32,615
I'm going to go put some pants on.

627
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,672
Fuck!

628
00:35:16,743 --> 00:35:17,743
Shit!

629
00:35:17,785 --> 00:35:19,579
- Oh my God.
- Sorry.

630
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:21,247
No, no, you're cool.

631
00:35:21,497 --> 00:35:22,937
You just spooked the fuck out of me.

632
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:24,834
That was supposed to be a little smoother.

633
00:35:25,085 --> 00:35:26,836
No, I'm good.

634
00:35:27,087 --> 00:35:28,838
I'm just, like, skittish.

635
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:32,216
Hey, what's up? Hi.
I haven't seen you in forever.

636
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:34,802
What are you listening to?

637
00:35:35,054 --> 00:35:36,846
No, don't! Stop!

638
00:35:37,097 --> 00:35:38,389
It's so embarrassing.

639
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,391
That's so degrading.

640
00:35:40,641 --> 00:35:42,518
Well, don't listen
to it if it offends you!

641
00:35:43,728 --> 00:35:45,563
It should offend you.

642
00:35:46,023 --> 00:35:48,358
I guess I don't mind being offended.

643
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:50,526
- Do you want one?
- Nah, I'm good.

644
00:35:51,611 --> 00:35:53,863
I always forget that. You don't smoke.

645
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,703
What are you doing out here then?

646
00:36:01,412 --> 00:36:03,831
You shouldn't have to
smoke to take a break outside.

647
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:10,213
You have any big summer
plans after graduation?

648
00:36:10,463 --> 00:36:11,631
You going anywhere?

649
00:36:13,216 --> 00:36:15,135
No, I'm just moving.

650
00:36:15,385 --> 00:36:17,054
So, packing, etc.

651
00:36:20,015 --> 00:36:21,975
- Moving sucks.
- Yeah.

652
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,103
My roommate like, freaked out

653
00:36:24,352 --> 00:36:25,993
because I didn't become obsessed with him

654
00:36:26,229 --> 00:36:27,647
after we had sex one time

655
00:36:27,897 --> 00:36:29,066
and he was like, “Get out.

656
00:36:29,315 --> 00:36:30,984
I can't take your energy.”

657
00:36:31,234 --> 00:36:32,235
- Damn!
- I know.

658
00:36:32,485 --> 00:36:34,029
What are you going to do?

659
00:36:34,947 --> 00:36:36,906
I don't know... squat at

660
00:36:37,157 --> 00:36:39,038
Katie's parents's place
on the Upper West Side?

661
00:36:40,535 --> 00:36:42,453
Or move to Philly for a bit.

662
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:43,703
I don't fucking know.

663
00:36:44,622 --> 00:36:46,874
Didn't someone tell me
you were going to Seattle?

664
00:36:48,085 --> 00:36:50,711
Yeah... that was when David and I
were still together

665
00:36:50,963 --> 00:36:53,173
- because his parents are from there so...
- Shit.

666
00:36:53,626 --> 00:36:55,405
- My bad.
- What? It's fine.

667
00:36:55,448 --> 00:36:56,519
Don't worry about it.

668
00:36:56,562 --> 00:36:58,237
No, I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have brought it up.

669
00:36:58,261 --> 00:37:00,013
No, seriously. It's no big deal.

670
00:37:00,056 --> 00:37:01,265
I don't care at all.

671
00:37:01,848 --> 00:37:04,101
- Sorry.
- Stop apologizing.

672
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,644
- Sorry, I mean...
- I'm still going to move though.

673
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:08,771
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

674
00:37:10,481 --> 00:37:11,481
Because if I don't

675
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:13,110
I'm just standing around

676
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,236
waiting for real life to begin.

677
00:37:16,071 --> 00:37:18,115
This isn't real life?

678
00:37:18,656 --> 00:37:19,949
I hope it's not.

679
00:37:20,658 --> 00:37:23,286
Anyways, I'm going to go finish my paper.

680
00:37:23,536 --> 00:37:25,329
But I'll text you.

681
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,540
- Let's get coffee or something?
- Yeah, for sure

682
00:37:27,582 --> 00:37:29,459
- Okay. Bye.
- See you.

683
00:37:31,086 --> 00:37:33,005
I guess it just feels like

684
00:37:33,254 --> 00:37:34,494
every person I talk to is like,

685
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,382
"Oh, I'm going to grad school post-grad"

686
00:37:36,632 --> 00:37:37,672
Or, like,

687
00:37:37,715 --> 00:37:40,094
"I'm going to work at this online magazine

688
00:37:40,137 --> 00:37:42,722
Or this start-up"

689
00:37:44,057 --> 00:37:45,058
and I'm just doing

690
00:37:45,308 --> 00:37:47,144
absolutely nothing.

691
00:37:47,727 --> 00:37:49,729
Do you have any goals post-grad?

692
00:37:50,189 --> 00:37:51,783
I know you're feeling overwhelmed

693
00:37:51,826 --> 00:37:53,949
But sometimes it's been
helpful for people graduating

694
00:37:53,996 --> 00:37:55,853
to look a few years out instead
of the immediate future,

695
00:37:55,877 --> 00:37:57,778
but a few years out.

696
00:37:57,821 --> 00:37:59,740
- How old are you?
- I'm twenty-two.

697
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:03,618
Okay, so maybe we could
think about when you're 25.

698
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:07,122
Do you see yourself in grad
school, or maybe traveling?

699
00:38:08,623 --> 00:38:10,625
Traveling could be cool, maybe. Yeah.

700
00:38:11,084 --> 00:38:13,836
Okay. What about your
interpersonal relationships?

701
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,132
Do you see yourself
fostering new friendships,

702
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:19,176
or maybe getting closer to your family

703
00:38:19,425 --> 00:38:21,261
since you've been away
for such a long time?

704
00:38:24,013 --> 00:38:26,015
I mean, all that sounds good to me...

705
00:38:26,432 --> 00:38:27,432
Okay.

706
00:38:28,017 --> 00:38:30,478
So I know we've talked
about your relationships,

707
00:38:30,728 --> 00:38:33,356
how you're always in
really long relationships.

708
00:38:33,606 --> 00:38:35,525
Do you think that's
something you want again,

709
00:38:35,775 --> 00:38:37,860
that type of stability and support?

710
00:38:38,861 --> 00:38:40,280
Maybe...

711
00:38:41,281 --> 00:38:43,200
Is that something I can, like,

712
00:38:43,449 --> 00:38:45,326
ask the universe for though?

713
00:38:46,577 --> 00:38:48,496
I don't know about the universe.

714
00:38:48,746 --> 00:38:50,957
But if you want to, you
can ask it for yourself.

715
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:53,960
If you think you deserve it

716
00:38:54,211 --> 00:38:55,336
then sure, make it a goal.

717
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,420
Okay.

718
00:38:58,131 --> 00:39:00,508
Are you still interested
in that boy you met?

719
00:39:00,758 --> 00:39:01,758
Leo?

720
00:39:04,512 --> 00:39:05,930
Yeah, I am

721
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,768
I don't really know what
he thinks of me, though.

722
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,272
We talk and then...

723
00:39:13,771 --> 00:39:15,731
I don't know. It's like,
I'm here, you know?

724
00:39:18,776 --> 00:39:20,778
- What is it about him?
- Hm?

725
00:39:21,696 --> 00:39:24,199
What is it about him
that makes him different?

726
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:26,409
You've had a lot of different experiences

727
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:28,120
and partners over the year.

728
00:39:28,163 --> 00:39:29,607
But nobody has seemed to have made

729
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,779
the same type of impression as he has.

730
00:39:31,956 --> 00:39:33,624
Do you have any feelings as to why?

731
00:39:38,546 --> 00:39:41,007
I don't know if this is weird to say,

732
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:43,551
but I think it's because

733
00:39:43,801 --> 00:39:45,636
he's also half-Asian.

734
00:39:45,886 --> 00:39:48,556
I've never been with anyone
who was half-Asian before

735
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:51,268
and I guess there's just

736
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:52,768
this sense of belonging.

737
00:39:53,728 --> 00:39:54,937
Like, I feel like I go through

738
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,105
a lot of weird bullshit

739
00:39:56,148 --> 00:39:57,398
because I'm half.

740
00:39:57,815 --> 00:39:59,900
And it's nice being with someone

741
00:40:00,235 --> 00:40:03,487
who I assume shares those
same feelings and experiences.

742
00:40:04,281 --> 00:40:05,656
That's actually really great.

743
00:40:05,906 --> 00:40:07,742
And it makes a lot of sense.

744
00:40:11,996 --> 00:40:13,914
Alright. Well, our time is up.

745
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:16,709
So, it's been really
great working with you.

746
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:18,628
And good luck with graduation.

747
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,839
Wait, what?

748
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:23,966
This is your eighth session.

749
00:40:24,675 --> 00:40:26,677
Wait, I thought I had one left.

750
00:40:27,887 --> 00:40:29,222
Hm. Let me check.

751
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:33,643
So you can see here

752
00:40:33,893 --> 00:40:36,188
you've had all eight of
your allotted sessions.

753
00:40:37,438 --> 00:40:39,440
Oh. Okay.

754
00:40:39,899 --> 00:40:42,068
I'm sorry. I know, it goes so fast

755
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,196
but you really have come far.

756
00:40:45,197 --> 00:40:47,240
I really don't feel like that at all.

757
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:49,950
Can I just like,

758
00:40:50,202 --> 00:40:51,994
text or call you

759
00:40:52,245 --> 00:40:53,996
maybe once or twice before graduation?

760
00:40:54,247 --> 00:40:55,664
Just for a few minutes to check in?

761
00:40:55,706 --> 00:40:58,293
Unfortunately, Riley, that's not allowed.

762
00:41:00,503 --> 00:41:02,422
Is there a ten, fifteen-minute

763
00:41:02,672 --> 00:41:05,132
time block I could take?
Like, at any time. I'll take it.

764
00:41:05,966 --> 00:41:08,594
Unfortunately, all the
slots have been filled.

765
00:41:08,844 --> 00:41:10,680
We have a lot of people to see.

766
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,682
Yeah, I know.

767
00:41:12,725 --> 00:41:15,813
It's just that you've gotten to know
me and my situation really well and...

768
00:41:16,018 --> 00:41:17,853
And I've really enjoyed that.

769
00:41:20,648 --> 00:41:23,484
A lot of my friends text their therapists.

770
00:41:24,902 --> 00:41:26,904
But I'm not your therapist anymore.

771
00:41:32,452 --> 00:41:34,371
Hey. I just thought I'd call you

772
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,501
because you said that
you were going to be free

773
00:41:36,664 --> 00:41:37,790
around now.

774
00:41:39,709 --> 00:41:41,711
So I just thought I'd call.

775
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:46,173
I'm just going to be
home working on stuff.

776
00:41:49,176 --> 00:41:51,721
Um, yeah. I found your chain as well

777
00:41:51,971 --> 00:41:53,764
when I was cleaning my room

778
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:55,725
so if you were wondering where that was,

779
00:41:55,975 --> 00:41:57,852
it's here. I have it.

780
00:41:59,479 --> 00:42:01,440
Okay, cool. Give me a call back.

781
00:42:02,189 --> 00:42:03,232
Bye.

782
00:42:16,746 --> 00:42:18,748
- Hey.
- Hey.

783
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:23,210
Did you go out tonight?

784
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,922
Yeah.

785
00:42:29,301 --> 00:42:32,210
I just went to this bar, like,

786
00:42:33,095 --> 00:42:34,389
down the way.

787
00:42:35,681 --> 00:42:37,766
I don't think it's lame to
go to a bar by yourself.

788
00:42:37,808 --> 00:42:38,893
Do you?

789
00:42:39,894 --> 00:42:40,894
No.

790
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:46,901
I failed.

791
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:48,860
What?

792
00:42:51,197 --> 00:42:52,907
My final paper.

793
00:42:53,533 --> 00:42:54,742
It sucked.

794
00:42:54,992 --> 00:42:56,869
I have to take a summer class.

795
00:42:59,872 --> 00:43:01,290
Oh. Shit.

796
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:04,251
Yeah.

797
00:43:04,503 --> 00:43:06,379
Shiiiiiit.

798
00:43:12,885 --> 00:43:15,095
I don't know how I'm
going to tell my parents.

799
00:43:16,389 --> 00:43:17,848
You'll figure it out.

800
00:43:18,098 --> 00:43:19,266
They're nice.

801
00:43:19,518 --> 00:43:21,226
I mean, they seemed
nice when you moved in.

802
00:43:30,403 --> 00:43:32,405
I'm going to ask you something.

803
00:43:33,656 --> 00:43:35,658
Shoot.

804
00:43:36,826 --> 00:43:38,828
Why do guys, like,

805
00:43:40,413 --> 00:43:42,331
ignore girls

806
00:43:42,582 --> 00:43:44,459
after they sleep with them?

807
00:43:47,379 --> 00:43:49,296
Maybe because they realize

808
00:43:49,548 --> 00:43:51,340
they're not what they're looking for?

809
00:43:51,591 --> 00:43:52,758
I don't know.

810
00:43:53,634 --> 00:43:55,010
But what if they are?

811
00:43:57,346 --> 00:43:59,348
How would you know that?

812
00:44:00,766 --> 00:44:02,685
Because,

813
00:44:02,935 --> 00:44:04,728
they had a mutual connection.

814
00:44:04,979 --> 00:44:07,440
Like, they had a mutually good time.

815
00:44:08,899 --> 00:44:10,818
Yeah. Or he's just a dick

816
00:44:11,068 --> 00:44:12,862
who just manipulates girls

817
00:44:13,112 --> 00:44:14,864
into thinking he's nice

818
00:44:15,114 --> 00:44:17,032
when he really just wants to fuck.

819
00:44:19,743 --> 00:44:21,745
Were you ever like that?

820
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,042
Probably more so in college.

821
00:44:28,711 --> 00:44:31,130
But that seems a little heartless now,
don't you think?

822
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,010
I don't think he's heartless.

823
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,721
I think something else is going on.

824
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:43,684
The answer is probably
simpler than you realize.

825
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,770
That he's...

826
00:44:47,104 --> 00:44:49,023
madly in love with me

827
00:44:49,315 --> 00:44:51,066
and everything he's doing is

828
00:44:51,317 --> 00:44:53,277
to hide the intensity of his emotions?

829
00:44:53,528 --> 00:44:55,279
Yeah. For sure.

830
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:57,449
That's it.

831
00:45:02,662 --> 00:45:04,581
I'm like, really sorry

832
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:07,207
about the way I treated you, Anderson.

833
00:45:08,042 --> 00:45:09,960
That really

834
00:45:10,252 --> 00:45:11,879
wasn't right of me.

835
00:45:12,796 --> 00:45:13,923
It's cool.

836
00:45:14,214 --> 00:45:16,091
No, it's not.

837
00:45:19,261 --> 00:45:21,722
You were like, such an amazing...

838
00:45:21,972 --> 00:45:23,223
Seriously,

839
00:45:23,475 --> 00:45:25,309
you were the best roommate I've ever had.

840
00:45:26,977 --> 00:45:28,854
Well, thank you.

841
00:45:29,104 --> 00:45:30,981
You're welcome.

842
00:45:45,996 --> 00:45:47,915
Stop, come on.

843
00:45:48,165 --> 00:45:50,627
No, Riley. This is fucked up. Alright?

844
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:53,837
You're leaving at the end of the month.

845
00:45:54,088 --> 00:45:55,255
Like, that is final.

846
00:45:55,507 --> 00:45:57,707
And I already found another roommate so...
I don't know.

847
00:45:58,635 --> 00:46:00,637
Go figure your shit out.

848
00:46:01,762 --> 00:46:02,846
Good night.

849
00:46:03,222 --> 00:46:05,224
And drink some fucking water.

850
00:46:18,821 --> 00:46:20,990
Yeah. Hey. I just wanted

851
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,951
to let you know I found like,
the most perfect apartment in Philly.

852
00:46:24,201 --> 00:46:26,036
- Cute!
- Yeah, it's on Passyunk.

853
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:28,288
It's right by that place we used

854
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,958
- to do karaoke every Wednesday.
- So cute!

855
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:33,293
Wait. Come back this weekend for a party.

856
00:46:33,336 --> 00:46:34,637
Yeah. That sounds cool.

857
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:36,837
And you know, Leo is
definitely supposed to be there.

858
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,007
Yeah. I'm totally down.

859
00:46:38,257 --> 00:46:40,217
Okay, cool. I'm pregaming
before with these girls

860
00:46:40,259 --> 00:46:41,740
from my class but they're really cool

861
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:43,624
- if you want to come.
- Yeah.

862
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:46,113
- Can you text me the details?
- Yeah. I'll talk to you later.

863
00:46:46,156 --> 00:46:48,183
- You good?
- I'm just about to go on the subway.

864
00:46:48,225 --> 00:46:49,644
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye!

865
00:46:57,151 --> 00:46:58,360
Ah, fuck!

866
00:47:26,305 --> 00:47:27,807
I thought that was you.

867
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:30,267
It's the hair.

868
00:47:31,477 --> 00:47:33,772
I thought you didn't have
class on this campus anymore.

869
00:47:34,021 --> 00:47:36,733
I don't.
I was here visiting an old professor.

870
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,736
How's everything going?

871
00:47:40,194 --> 00:47:41,654
Fine. I guess.

872
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:46,116
I saw that same guy on the Q train.

873
00:47:48,118 --> 00:47:50,037
The one we saw drop the baby.

874
00:47:50,329 --> 00:47:52,539
He was with his wife
on the train with the baby

875
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,459
and I think he recognized me

876
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:56,960
and I was just staring at him

877
00:47:57,211 --> 00:47:58,962
and I couldn't stop laughing.

878
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:00,213
It was really funny.

879
00:48:00,422 --> 00:48:02,299
Did the baby look okay?

880
00:48:03,063 --> 00:48:05,385
Mm, his head was definitely
a little squashed looking...

881
00:48:05,427 --> 00:48:07,221
but still cute.

882
00:48:07,471 --> 00:48:08,807
Oh my God.

883
00:48:10,057 --> 00:48:12,059
I heard you're moving out of Anderson's.

884
00:48:14,061 --> 00:48:15,896
Yeah. We slept together.

885
00:48:16,563 --> 00:48:17,816
I heard.

886
00:48:19,776 --> 00:48:21,778
What was your reaction?

887
00:48:22,779 --> 00:48:24,404
I don't know.

888
00:48:24,656 --> 00:48:25,816
It was kind of weird to hear.

889
00:48:26,532 --> 00:48:29,159
But, I always sensed a vibe with you guys,

890
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:31,036
so, you know, I wasn't shocked.

891
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:33,956
There wasn't a vibe.

892
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:35,791
Okay.

893
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,669
It just happened.

894
00:48:38,544 --> 00:48:39,796
Okay.

895
00:48:42,047 --> 00:48:43,367
Listen, I wanted to tell you that

896
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:45,802
I'm not going to be
moving to Seattle anymore.

897
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,553
What, why?

898
00:48:47,804 --> 00:48:49,681
Jess got a job here.

899
00:48:50,222 --> 00:48:51,265
Jess?

900
00:48:51,766 --> 00:48:53,142
Jessica. Yeah.

901
00:48:53,392 --> 00:48:55,269
She got a job in the city

902
00:48:56,395 --> 00:48:58,063
so we're going to be staying in the city.

903
00:48:59,982 --> 00:49:01,984
Why does this concern me?

904
00:49:02,609 --> 00:49:03,658
I don't know.

905
00:49:03,701 --> 00:49:06,461
I thought it'd be kind of weird
if we bumped into each other on the street

906
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,532
and you'd thought that I'd
moved and I hadn't moved.

907
00:49:08,574 --> 00:49:10,450
And I just thought I should let you know.

908
00:49:11,076 --> 00:49:13,078
Well, I'm not staying here, so...

909
00:49:13,705 --> 00:49:14,789
Where are you moving?

910
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:16,540
I'm going back to Philly.

911
00:49:16,791 --> 00:49:18,584
I'm, like, getting my own apartment.

912
00:49:18,835 --> 00:49:20,377
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

913
00:49:21,086 --> 00:49:23,547
I'm kind of seeing this guy there.

914
00:49:23,798 --> 00:49:25,966
He doesn't want to do
the distance anymore.

915
00:49:26,759 --> 00:49:29,839
Well, that will be good for you guys
to be closer together. That will be nice.

916
00:49:33,766 --> 00:49:35,684
So as usual you're making

917
00:49:35,935 --> 00:49:37,477
a really big deal out of nothing.

918
00:49:38,897 --> 00:49:40,147
I mean, if you feel that way...

919
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,440
Like, are you trying
to rub it in my face?

920
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,120
No, Riley. I would never do that.
I swear. That's not what this is.

921
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,490
Then what are you doing?

922
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,990
I don't know.

923
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,870
I still care about you.

924
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,620
I still feel love for you.

925
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:59,070
- I just wanted to be honest with you.
- Don't say that.

926
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:00,290
Say what?

927
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:02,830
That hippy-dippy bullshit.

928
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,710
Don't say you feel love for me.

929
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,300
That's like some weird
fucked-up consolation prize.

930
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:10,140
Because you have it in your head

931
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:12,030
that if you loved me you
wouldn't have cheated

932
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:13,820
and since you only feel love for me

933
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,220
you're still a good person.

934
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:17,150
Riley, we've talked
about this a million times.

935
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:20,180
I swear, nothing happened when
you and I were together with Jessica.

936
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:21,940
Whatever! Emotional cheating!

937
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:23,940
All those nights when you were, like,

938
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:25,270
late to come home

939
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,010
or you wouldn't text me till morning

940
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,576
and you were always like, “Jessica and I
went on a run,”

941
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,820
and “Jessica and I did this,”

942
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,626
and “Jessica says I should
eat more fermented foods”

943
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:32,910
and oh my God! Fuck you!

944
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:34,110
Seriously!

945
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,820
I can't believe I am out here yet again

946
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:37,330
letting you waste my time!

947
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:40,240
And honestly,

948
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:42,290
even if we did see each other in the city

949
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,290
I'd probably walk right past you

950
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,830
and say to whoever I was with:

951
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,640
"There's the asshole that cheated on me

952
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:49,190
and the stupid bitch he's with now."

953
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:50,980
Okay. Please don't
talk about her like that.

954
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,900
- It's got nothing to do with her.
- Okay!

955
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,010
Listen, I just think if we kept talking

956
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,340
we could be friends.

957
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,300
And I do miss your friendship.

958
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:01,430
I miss you as a person.

959
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,270
I don't.

960
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,520
I don't miss your constant
whining and complaining

961
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:08,520
and talking about how smelly the city is

962
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:11,780
and how you like, literally root
through my garbage to find the recycling

963
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:13,240
like some fucking weird psychopath,

964
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,080
- like who even fucking does that?
- So sue me

965
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,660
for thinking recycling's important.

966
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:18,410
- Fuck you.
- What are you doing?

967
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:19,450
Riley! Stop it!

968
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:21,400
Oh my God, are you okay?

969
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,620
Do you need me to call somebody?

970
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:26,500
- Call somebody? She's...
- Am I talking to you?

971
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:29,290
Seriously, I can walk you somewhere.
I can get you a cab

972
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,420
Are you okay?

973
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:40,430
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

974
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:42,430
No we're...

975
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:45,310
We're really good.

976
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:47,560
I'm sorry. I'm good. Thank you.

977
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:50,360
- Okay.
- Seriously, thank you.

978
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,320
Riley, what the fuck was that?

979
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,280
I can't believe...

980
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:00,410
she thought...

981
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,080
I, like, needed back up!

982
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,820
Hey. Are you going to that party in center?

983
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:46,200
I was thinking about it.
Why? What's up?

984
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,580
I think I'll be there. We should meet up.

985
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,080
Actually, yeah, I'll definitely be there.

986
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:53,290
When do you think you'll be there?

987
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:59,470
Hi!

988
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:02,510
Hi! I'm glad you came.

989
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,160
- This is fucking crazy!
- I know, right?

990
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,350
- Come on. Let's go.
- Okay!

991
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,430
Sorry, excuse me.

992
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:15,650
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

993
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,240
- So I saw that Fred was here.
- Yeah.

994
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,280
How is everything?

995
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,040
It's good. Really good. Yeah.

996
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:29,500
You guys have…?

997
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,080
Damn, how was it?

998
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:34,380
It was very sexy.

999
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,290
Shit. Fred?

1000
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,340
- Yeah. It was hot.
- Damn!

1001
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,050
- Oh my God.
- Yeah.

1002
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,050
Wait, is Leo here?

1003
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,470
Yeah, I think so. He's
probably looking for you.

1004
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:47,010
- Yeah, maybe.
- You should go find him.

1005
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:57,020
Oh, hey, what's up...

1006
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:01,070
Hey, what's up?

1007
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,200
Were you just watching me?

1008
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:05,780
What? No! What?

1009
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:07,910
I'm fucking with you. What's up?

1010
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:09,410
Oh. Hah.

1011
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,410
I just wanted to know where Leo went?

1012
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,040
Yeah, it was really crowded inside

1013
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:16,170
so we went to this pop-up shop.

1014
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,750
A pop-up shop?

1015
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:21,010
Yeah, they don't really
card so we go there a lot.

1016
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:22,920
Just search "Kamihira."

1017
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,720
Sorry, sorry.

1018
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:37,530
Oh my God, Riley?

1019
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:39,070
Oh my God! Hey, Juliet. What's up?

1020
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,840
Aren't you supposed to be in New York?

1021
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,160
- Yeah, I am...
- I haven't seen you since,

1022
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:47,200
like, high school.

1023
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,530
That's crazy.

1024
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,870
Is your life, like, a TV show now?

1025
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,410
Because I saw this picture of you

1026
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:55,540
at this party or something,

1027
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,380
and I was just like, oh my God,

1028
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:01,260
I knew that Riley was this cool,
different, kind of quirky girl

1029
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:03,670
but you looked like a fucking celebrity.

1030
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,680
Like on that roof?

1031
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:07,260
Was that in Brooklyn?

1032
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,020
Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

1033
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,890
And I've just been, like,
chugging away at Penn.

1034
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:16,900
I'm a Comcast intern.

1035
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:18,900
And I'm also head of my sorority,

1036
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:20,900
which I know is so like...

1037
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:23,900
I never thought I'd be the
head bi-atch you know-

1038
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:25,900
Yeah, no, totally.

1039
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,030
Do you know this guy named Leo?

1040
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,580
Leo? Sophomore in studio art?

1041
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:35,960
Yeah. Do you know my brother, Peter?

1042
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,170
He's friends with him.

1043
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:40,210
They film skate videos together

1044
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:43,260
on this little camera they
got from the thrift store!

1045
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,260
Which is so adorable.

1046
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,380
Why?

1047
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,930
We're kind of hooking up.

1048
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:53,060
No way. Are you serious?

1049
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:55,640
He is really cute.

1050
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,770
That's exciting. He's cute!

1051
00:55:58,270 --> 00:55:59,849
Oh my God.

1052
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:01,270
So I'm going to go find him.

1053
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,530
Wait, tell me really quick:
What are you doing after grad?

1054
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,160
I'm not doing much of anything.

1055
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:12,200
I'm just sort of having
a mental breakdown.

1056
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,750
Same. Don't you love how now
you can just be having a mental breakdown?

1057
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,910
Yeah. Totally.

1058
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:20,380
Okay, well, I'll see you later.

1059
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:22,510
Alright, well, take a
shot with me later, okay?

1060
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,550
- Okay, I will.
- Bye!

1061
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:27,800
Oh, shit!

1062
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:38,140
- Hey.
- Whoa.

1063
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,980
Hey. What's up?

1064
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,610
I've been good, chilling,

1065
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:46,070
working in the studio
every day on this painting.

1066
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,150
- Cool.
- Yeah, it's been a time.

1067
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,160
- I'd love to see it when it's done...
- Pussy!

1068
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:51,290
Yo, chill!

1069
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,870
What were you saying?

1070
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:00,710
No, yeah. I'd just love
to see it when it's done.

1071
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,500
For sure.

1072
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:04,460
It's going to be another month, but...

1073
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,630
Yeah. In a month, then.

1074
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:09,510
Yeah, for sure.

1075
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,640
I'm going to go inside and grab a beer.

1076
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,100
- I'll see you around though, yeah?
- For sure.

1077
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,060
Maybe tomorrow

1078
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,240
we could, like, grab dinner or something?

1079
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:22,730
I don't know...

1080
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:25,820
I got a shit ton of work that I
should be doing right now, honestly.

1081
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,900
Okay, so do it in the morning, then.

1082
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:33,490
It's kind of like an all-day thing.

1083
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:35,990
Okay, yeah.

1084
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:41,920
Are you okay?

1085
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,090
Yeah, um...

1086
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:54,470
I don't know. I'm sorry.

1087
00:57:57,930 --> 00:57:59,810
I just thought that

1088
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:01,940
because we slept together...

1089
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,110
I don't know. You'd
think this is more special.

1090
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,190
But maybe that's my bad.

1091
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:11,650
No, I mean, it was special.

1092
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,660
It was super special, like, in the moment.

1093
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:16,200
I just feel like it wasn't significant.

1094
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:18,830
I just feel like those
are two different things.

1095
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:21,500
I don't know.

1096
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:24,210
I saw you as a prospect?

1097
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:26,340
I don't know. I'm sorry.

1098
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,800
I'm super high

1099
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:31,420
and not really communicating properly.

1100
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,220
- I'm sorry.
- No.

1101
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:36,680
It's cool, it's cool...

1102
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:40,470
You don't have to apologize.

1103
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,520
So I'm going to go.

1104
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:46,400
I'm going to go back to
that party Fred was at.

1105
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,020
Yeah. That party was fun.

1106
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:54,610
I would really like to see you again.

1107
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:00,160
Yeah, just text me.

1108
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:02,620
I mean, I know I've
been slow with the texts.

1109
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:05,580
I just have class all day

1110
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:07,380
and then I forget to respond.

1111
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,500
I just figured I'd see
you when I'd see you.

1112
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:14,090
- Yeah totally.
- Yeah, just text me.

1113
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:16,300
Okay, I'll text you.

1114
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,810
- Alright, bye.
- See you.

1115
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:32,110
I'm going to be moving to Philly soon, so…

1116
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:33,730
Sweet.

1117
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:36,030
Bye.

1118
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,090
I don't know, it just feels like...

1119
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:42,530
He doesn't really know what I'm doing.

1120
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,540
I just feel like an idiot, right.
Okay, thank you.

1121
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:50,360
I just feel like I really don't know
what I'm doing because I'm, like, here.

1122
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,840
And he said that he really liked me.

1123
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,640
And I don't really understand...
Okay, sorry.

1124
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,630
And I just don't understand like,

1125
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:58,800
why I wanted to be here.

1126
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:01,700
Yo. What the fuck are you doing here?

1127
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:04,350
Drinking!

1128
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,400
Do Mom and Dad know you're here?

1129
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:13,480
No. They think I'm
sleeping over at Jenny's.

1130
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:15,570
They're so gullible.

1131
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:17,400
Don't talk about them that way.

1132
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,740
You act like you're so
much smarter than them.

1133
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:25,410
But you're not. I promise you you're not.

1134
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:28,750
Why are you even here anyways?

1135
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:30,710
I'm moving here.

1136
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:32,630
Why?

1137
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,090
What am I going to do in New York?

1138
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:37,470
Um, get a job?

1139
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,510
But I have, like, no skills.

1140
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,430
What have you been doing
in college for four years?

1141
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:48,350
Thinking, I guess.

1142
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:54,110
I have some coke. Do you want some coke?

1143
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:57,150
Where did you get it from?

1144
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:59,320
My friends gave it to me.

1145
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:03,280
Have you done it before?

1146
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:05,870
Yeah. It felt so good.

1147
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,120
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1148
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,420
It felt like every part of my body

1149
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:13,460
was exactly where it was supposed to be

1150
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:15,670
and doing exactly what it needed to do.

1151
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,760
So I hooked up with a
really hot boy tonight.

1152
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,890
Oh yeah? What was his name?

1153
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:25,930
I think his name was
Leo. He was mixed, also.

1154
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:27,560
Did you see him?

1155
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:30,140
No. I wasn't there for that long.

1156
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:34,690
Are you sure this
party's going to be better?

1157
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,070
Yeah. Who the fuck
makes a pop-up shop a destination?

1158
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,110
- Dude!
- Get in the car.

1159
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,239
Hey, can you open the door?

1160
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,240
Thank you!

1161
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:58,590
Hey! Make a wish! Happy birthday!

1162
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:08,310
- It's melting!
- Oh, shit!

1163
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,820
- Oh my God.
- Hey, what's up?

1164
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,950
You brought your little sister!

1165
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,320
That is so responsible of you.

1166
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:28,370
- Did you see…?
- No!

1167
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,500
We'll talk about it.

1168
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,500
- Is there more jungle juice?
- Yeah, it's in the bathroom.

1169
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:45,010
Stop. I don't think you
should drink any more.

1170
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,050
What, why?

1171
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:50,520
- You're too young.
- Come on!

1172
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:52,350
I'm serious.

1173
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:53,430
If you keep doing that

1174
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,600
people will think you're
this crazy slut or something.

1175
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,360
Are you serious?

1176
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:01,480
Okay. Maybe not, like, that.

1177
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,570
But people will take advantage of you.

1178
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:05,360
People will think you're a ditz.

1179
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:07,120
What's the matter with you?

1180
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:08,700
Oh my God. Nothing.

1181
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:10,830
I'm just trying to help you. Jesus.

1182
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:13,660
I'm going to go find my friends.

1183
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,430
Fuck it.

1184
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:38,060
- Oh hey. What's up?
- Oh, shit, hey.

1185
01:03:38,310 --> 01:03:39,940
How was the other party?

1186
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,980
Ugh, fucking sucked.

1187
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:43,360
Damn.

1188
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,510
- Is there any more in there?
- Oh, yeah. There's, like, tons.

1189
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:49,740
Actually I'll come in
with you and get some more.

1190
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:51,160
Whoa, okay.

1191
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,960
- So I did see Leo tonight.
- Yeah?

1192
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:08,090
He's, like...

1193
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:10,550
kind of a huge asshole, isn't he?

1194
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,680
Why do you think that?

1195
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:15,680
I don't know. I just think

1196
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:17,810
he's kind of a huge asshole.

1197
01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:23,320
He said you guys had a lot of fun.

1198
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:26,810
Probably because he, like,
doesn't know how to have sex.

1199
01:04:31,370 --> 01:04:33,580
Well, he said... you guys ugh...

1200
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:37,410
- I mean never mind. Whatever.
- What?

1201
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:40,250
No. It's weird.

1202
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:42,170
Come on. Tell me.

1203
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,170
I won't, like, get offended.

1204
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:46,050
I, like, never get offended.

1205
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,470
Really?

1206
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,890
He said that you were pretty good in bed.

1207
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:53,390
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1208
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:00,440
What did you think

1209
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:02,150
when he said that?

1210
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:05,780
What do you mean?

1211
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:07,530
Like,

1212
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:11,740
is that what you expected?

1213
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:14,870
Yeah...

1214
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,990
I thought... I guess that made sense.

1215
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:26,630
Riley! Riley!

1216
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,220
- Hey, what's up?
- I think your sister needs you.

1217
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:31,510
She's super wasted in the kitchen.

1218
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,510
I didn't know if I should call someone,

1219
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:35,720
- your parents...
- Yeah, yeah, no you're right.

1220
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,720
- That's the right thing to do.
- Everything okay?

1221
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:41,850
What's going on?

1222
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:44,770
Oh, nothing, we were just

1223
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:46,500
having a drink and talking for a sec.

1224
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:52,110
I'm gonna talk to Valerie, okay?
One sec.

1225
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:57,450
Excuse me! Excuse me!

1226
01:05:57,830 --> 01:05:59,830
Holy shit. Valerie.

1227
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,330
What's going on?

1228
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,130
Shit.

1229
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:07,550
Hey. The car was 25.

1230
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,050
Pay me when you can.

1231
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:10,590
Hope Val's okay.

1232
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,400
Riley?

1233
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:32,070
What are you doing here?

1234
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,280
I told you,

1235
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:40,160
I was sleeping over

1236
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:41,870
at Jenny's.

1237
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:44,210
I came home early

1238
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:47,380
- because I wasn't feeling well.
- Stop lying!

1239
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:50,380
Then why you wearing
those sorts of clothes?

1240
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:52,340
Don't lie to your mother!

1241
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:53,880
You were out!

1242
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:55,410
Mom,

1243
01:06:55,450 --> 01:06:57,490
can you not speak Chinese right now?

1244
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:58,600
Please.

1245
01:06:58,760 --> 01:06:59,810
Why?

1246
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:03,180
It's just difficult to
process it right now.

1247
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,020
Because you're hungover?

1248
01:07:05,810 --> 01:07:08,020
Riley, can you please
just tell us the truth?

1249
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:11,480
I'd like to be left out of this.

1250
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,650
- Are you kidding?
- No!

1251
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,030
You arrive here, unannounced,

1252
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,740
you have vomit all over you-

1253
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:21,370
I told you guys, I'm
sorry I forgot to text you.

1254
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,750
I'm here to see that apartment.

1255
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,290
What apartment?

1256
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:27,290
What are you talking about?

1257
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:30,420
I'm moving here after graduation.

1258
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:32,760
Why?

1259
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:36,010
Why not?

1260
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:37,590
What are you going to do here?

1261
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:39,510
What am I going to do in New York?

1262
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,560
But why didn't you call us?

1263
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:43,810
It's not like you to just show up-

1264
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,350
None of this is making sense.

1265
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,900
Can someone please start
telling me what is going on?

1266
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:49,900
Oh my God! I'm an adult!

1267
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:52,610
I'm allowed to come home whenever I want!

1268
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,610
Right? Isn't that what
you guys said to me?

1269
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,280
Riley...

1270
01:07:57,150 --> 01:07:59,160
Come with me. Come!

1271
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:18,760
Riley, what is going on with you?

1272
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:21,510
I don't know.

1273
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:22,970
What do you mean?

1274
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:24,220
Tell me.

1275
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,440
I can't believe I have
to keep saying this.

1276
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:30,730
I'm. Here. To. See.

1277
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:32,360
An. Apartment.

1278
01:08:32,730 --> 01:08:34,650
But why would you move here?

1279
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,820
You don't really have
any friends left... and...

1280
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,320
I don't know. What about

1281
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:42,450
your friend Katie and
all your other friends?

1282
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:46,200
I don't know! I guess I
just want a change, okay?

1283
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,420
Why don't we talk about
this after graduation?

1284
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,090
Okay...

1285
01:08:57,670 --> 01:08:58,760
What?

1286
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,720
That's the other thing.

1287
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:08,310
I think I might have
to take a summer class.

1288
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:11,650
What?

1289
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:13,860
Why?

1290
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,440
I don't know. I just think I do.

1291
01:09:19,650 --> 01:09:21,660
I just didn't really
have my shit together.

1292
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:25,040
Why do you keep saying that?

1293
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:26,700
What does that even mean?

1294
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:29,790
It means I messed up.

1295
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,080
And to get my diploma

1296
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:32,790
I need to take this class.

1297
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:34,960
And then you'll get it?
And then you're done?

1298
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,380
- Yes.
- How much?

1299
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:41,680
It's four credits.

1300
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:43,800
So however much that costs.

1301
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:46,100
Okay.

1302
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:47,970
I'll pay you back.

1303
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:50,350
I don't know. After I
get a job or something

1304
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,150
I'll be able to pay you back.

1305
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:55,520
Let's do a deal.

1306
01:09:58,030 --> 01:09:59,360
Okay?

1307
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:01,900
You tell me what happened
last night with Valerie,

1308
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,320
and it's fine,

1309
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:05,080
I'll cover the costs.

1310
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:07,450
I just need to know
what's going on with her.

1311
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:10,330
- What?
- That's what I need.

1312
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:13,000
You know it'll help Valerie too.

1313
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,850
She's obviously going through something.

1314
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,290
Her rebellious stage.

1315
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,300
Mom, you're not serious.

1316
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,340
Valerie is always lying to me.

1317
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:24,890
She's always sneaking out.

1318
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:26,600
And she thinks we're dumb.

1319
01:10:26,850 --> 01:10:28,680
She thinks she can get away with it.

1320
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:30,100
I just need to know.

1321
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:32,350
I can't help her if I don't
know what she's doing.

1322
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:42,900
Okay...

1323
01:10:45,610 --> 01:10:46,610
Last night...

1324
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:48,080
Are you kidding me?

1325
01:10:48,330 --> 01:10:50,120
Drinking alcohol? Partying all night?

1326
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:51,660
Why are you doing this?!

1327
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:54,920
Why would you ever think
of doing anything like this?

1328
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:57,210
- Aren't you ashamed?
- Mom!

1329
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,750
You're grounded! I
don't know for how long!

1330
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:02,260
Mom!

1331
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:04,380
Why are you doing this?

1332
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:06,760
What did I do wrong as a mother?

1333
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:08,240
- I'm so disappointed
- Riley,

1334
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:09,630
I can't even look at you!

1335
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:11,220
You let this happen?

1336
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,830
I can't believe you told on me!

1337
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:16,230
They wouldn't pay for my
summer class if I didn't, okay?

1338
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:18,630
- What summer class?
- And I'm taking away your cell phone.

1339
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:20,650
I am taking away your cell phone.

1340
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,110
You greedy bitch!

1341
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:25,490
Valerie!

1342
01:11:26,530 --> 01:11:27,740
Riley, what summer class?

1343
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:29,580
Aren't you graduating next week?

1344
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:31,290
So Riley just gets away with everything?

1345
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:33,080
- She did the same shit I did!
- No.

1346
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:35,080
I'm taking away your credit card!

1347
01:11:35,330 --> 01:11:37,670
Excuse me? Mom, you didn't say that.

1348
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,670
I don't know why you
think you deserve that

1349
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,210
after what you did!

1350
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:42,710
You should be glad that's all!

1351
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,630
You're a terrible sister! I hate you!

1352
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,010
- You don't hate me!
- Yes, I do!

1353
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:49,470
You're a bitch with no
sense of loyalty and honestly?

1354
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,390
No sense of self!

1355
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:53,290
- Excuse me?! Fuck you!
- Riley! Stop!

1356
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:55,020
What the hell's the matter with you?

1357
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,850
She's crazy!

1358
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:58,900
She's crazy! She's going out of her mind.

1359
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:01,270
You are insane! No wonder David left you!

1360
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,860
What! What did you say to me?!

1361
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:05,320
Riley! Calm down!

1362
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:12,240
Okay, calm down.

1363
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:14,290
Take some deep breaths.

1364
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:17,250
Get her a glass of water.

1365
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:26,170
- No, use the Brita.
- It doesn't fucking matter.

1366
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,640
I don't know why you'd bring up David,

1367
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:36,890
Valerie, because you
know how much he hurt me.

1368
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:39,900
We were together for three years and

1369
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:43,570
he just stopped, like, loving me.

1370
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:45,860
I don't even know how that happens.

1371
01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:48,030
How does a person stop loving you?

1372
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:52,530
And now I just feel ugly all the time.

1373
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:55,910
And I feel like no boy wants to date me.

1374
01:12:57,450 --> 01:12:59,790
And I don't know what to do anymore.

1375
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,920
I just know

1376
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:05,210
this can't be the rest of my life.
It can't be.

1377
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,430
I just keep searching...

1378
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:13,640
in the dark for some kind of light

1379
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:15,720
or something to click and tell me

1380
01:13:15,970 --> 01:13:17,730
that everything is going to be okay

1381
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:20,810
and what kind of person
I'm supposed to be.

1382
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:22,940
And it just never happens.

1383
01:13:26,150 --> 01:13:28,150
Riley, try to calm down, okay?

1384
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,500
I'm sorry, okay?

1385
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,080
Please don't be mad at Valerie.

1386
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:43,920
I should've stopped her.

1387
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:45,250
She's just a dumb kid

1388
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,260
and I should've stopped her.

1389
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:50,880
I'm sorry, okay? I'm really sorry.

1390
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:54,220
I'm just being so stupid, Valerie.

1391
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:56,350
I'm sorry. I'm just being so stupid.

1392
01:13:58,970 --> 01:14:00,980
Okay...

1393
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,480
Group hug, okay? Come on.

1394
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:09,070
Group hug. Valerie.

1395
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:11,360
Group hug.

1396
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,030
Hey. Are you awake?

1397
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:55,070
Sort of.

1398
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:57,830
Mom made you these noodles.

1399
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,330
They're really good

1400
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:01,080
Cool.

1401
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,210
There's a lot of sesame oil on them.

1402
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:11,590
I just wanted to come say bye.

1403
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:14,010
I'm going back to New York in a sec.

1404
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:18,180
I thought you were
touring an apartment here.

1405
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,060
No. I'm not.

1406
01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:23,060
That was, like, so weird of me.

1407
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,400
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1408
01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:27,980
I actually have a meeting
with a professor later

1409
01:15:28,230 --> 01:15:30,280
because I failed her class.

1410
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:31,530
That sucks.

1411
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:32,900
Yeah.

1412
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:35,410
But I deserved it.

1413
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:38,200
Stop throwing yourself a pity party.

1414
01:15:42,290 --> 01:15:45,080
How long are you going to be this sad for?

1415
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:48,420
I don't know.

1416
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:50,340
Because I'd be bored of it by now.

1417
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,420
Yeah.

1418
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:56,130
I think I've been bored of it for a while.

1419
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,600
- Are you still mad at me?
- Yes.

1420
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:06,440
Alright. I'll leave you to it.

1421
01:16:06,690 --> 01:16:08,230
- Bye.
- Bye.

1422
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,230
Text me... oh wait.

1423
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,570
Fuck you.

1424
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:19,990
- Riley!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1425
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:22,370
- Bye.
- Bye.

1426
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:26,290
- Riley!!
- Sorry!

1427
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,420
Alright I'm going. Bye!

1428
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:49,310
<i>I'd like to think that I'm not cold</i>

1429
01:16:52,110 --> 01:16:55,320
<i>Pretend I'm not afraid of</i>

1430
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:57,450
<i>growing old</i>

1431
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:03,490
<i>Sadness hidden behind bad jokes</i>

1432
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:16,380
<i>I made it rain love letters</i>

1433
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:20,680
<i>They made their way into landfills</i>

1434
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:30,600
<i>I guess I learned my lesson</i>

1435
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:35,270
<i>So lucky heartbreaks can't kill</i>

1436
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:47,220
I swear she was like, six years old.

1437
01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:49,960
She was so little.

1438
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,710
I was pretty drunk.

1439
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:57,960
I mean, it's a graduation.
It's a ceremony.

1440
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:00,470
It makes sense to be drunk.

1441
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:02,360
Hey.

1442
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:04,090
Hey, what's up?

1443
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:06,220
Gabby's not coming?

1444
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:09,140
No, I don't think so.

1445
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:11,730
She was like,

1446
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:13,850
“I need a little bit of a break,” so...

1447
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,400
Shit.

1448
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:18,070
No, yeah, it's cool.

1449
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,190
Like, I can't even think about it.

1450
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:23,820
Yeah. It's overwhelming.

1451
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:25,490
Yeah.

1452
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:28,330
Very overwhelming...

1453
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,460
I'm actually kind of sad.

1454
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:38,420
I can't believe it's the end.

1455
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,090
It's not the end.

1456
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,550
I won't let it be.

1457
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,520
You know that global warming

1458
01:18:49,770 --> 01:18:50,850
is just a temporary thing.

1459
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:53,230
The Earth, when it
reaches its breaking point,

1460
01:18:53,650 --> 01:18:56,560
is going to reverse its charge,

1461
01:18:56,810 --> 01:18:57,860
like a battery

1462
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,780
and then destroy everything

1463
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,570
and the world resets.

1464
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:04,280
Like back to its factory settings.

1465
01:19:04,530 --> 01:19:07,070
But it's not
instantaneous, you know?

1466
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,080
It takes a while.

1467
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:13,160
So we're definitely still going to have to
deal with global warming

1468
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:15,750
and the O-zone being fucked up

1469
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,090
and there being no polar bears.

1470
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,250
Yeah, I mean, but I'm
saying it doesn't matter

1471
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,800
because the Earth, like, knows what to do.

1472
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:27,010
It's going to happen way after we die,

1473
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:28,680
but it's going to happen.

1474
01:19:29,050 --> 01:19:31,770
Okay, but that's like a
really irresponsible way

1475
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:34,770
to think of your role as
a conscious human being.

1476
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:37,520
But it's just what the science says.

1477
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,360
Where did you even read that?

1478
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:42,780
I read it in an article.

1479
01:19:43,190 --> 01:19:44,610
- I think I saw that.
- Yeah?

1480
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:45,680
Yeah.

1481
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:47,410
Okay, you guys.

1482
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:50,080
You can't believe everything
you read in some article, anyway.

1483
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,540
Yeah. But you can't just live

1484
01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:53,580
your life like the world's going to end.

1485
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:04,590
Holy shit.

1486
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:07,130
You need to stop scaring me, seriously.

1487
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:09,260
But that felt good though, right?

1488
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,600
- Um, maybe.
- Here.

1489
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:16,770
Okay, yeah.

1490
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:18,900
Yeah, I see that.

1491
01:20:21,190 --> 01:20:22,270
Can I kiss you?

1492
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:29,620
I don't think that's such a good idea.

1493
01:20:31,950 --> 01:20:33,950
Yeah okay. I feel that.

1494
01:20:48,430 --> 01:20:50,430
- Hey!
- Hey!

1495
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:54,260
Don't. My dad's gonna kill you.

1496
01:20:54,770 --> 01:20:56,430
No, he said I could finish it.

1497
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,640
We were working on it
this morning together.

1498
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:01,350
Okay:

1499
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:03,650
Put on the line in quotes.

1500
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:05,780
Starting with “A.”

1501
01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:09,150
It's six letters.

1502
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:12,280
It's in quotes, yeah.

1503
01:21:12,950 --> 01:21:14,160
Air dry.

1504
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:17,330
Yes. I think that's it.

1505
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,460
Okay, do you wanna finish it with me?

1506
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:24,540
I feel like I'm so stuck
on a few of these.

1507
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:26,630
I can't. I have to go.

1508
01:21:27,010 --> 01:21:28,470
Oh my God!

1509
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:29,840
Good luck!

1510
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:32,390
I'm gonna be such a
good artist's assistant...

1511
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:35,100
You're gonna be such a
good artist's assistant...

1512
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:37,730
See you later!

1513
01:21:37,970 --> 01:21:40,100
Bye, weirdo!

1514
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:42,230
- Have a good day.
- Bye!

1515
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:47,860
Shit!

1516
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:56,620
Hi, this is Professor Hung's class, right?

1517
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:58,290
- Yeah, it is.
- Cool.

1518
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:01,830
- What's your name?
- Hi, I'm Riley.

1519
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,710
- I'm Charlie.
- Nice to meet you

1520
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:04,960
Good to meet you.

1521
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,300
So why are you taking this class?

1522
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:10,760
Because I failed it last semester.

1523
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:12,650
So now I have to retake it to graduate.

1524
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:14,490
- Oh my God. That sucks.
- Yeah, it's okay.

1525
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:16,300
I'm, like, very excited to be here.

1526
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:18,740
Are you, like, a senior?
Or would you have been a senior?

1527
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:21,180
Like, I walked at graduation.

1528
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:23,560
So now this is the last step.

1529
01:22:23,810 --> 01:22:25,560
Then I'm a real person.

1530
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:27,690
Then I'm an adult.
