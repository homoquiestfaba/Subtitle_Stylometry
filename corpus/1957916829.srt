183
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:37,297
You're gonna all be famous.

184
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:39,399
This is my present to you.

185
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:41,468
Merry fucking Christmas.

186
00:16:41,503 --> 00:16:46,206
The great liberation is at hand,
and you are a part of it.

187
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,609
We're going--

188
00:16:47,642 --> 00:16:49,443
[customers scream, gasp]

189
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:53,313
Get them up.
Get them in the vault.

190
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:56,283
Someone blast a hole
in those security cameras.

191
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:01,321
Get them in there.

192
00:17:03,558 --> 00:17:04,792
[groaning]

193
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:09,664
But I'm not selling religion.

194
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:11,365
I'm selling freedom.

195
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:15,637
[groaning]

196
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,471
Stand up, Jaden.
Come on. Get up.

197
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:19,541
[Jaden] Thanks, guys.

198
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,378
Brother, med, please.

199
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:27,749
My vision is clear...

200
00:17:29,884 --> 00:17:32,319
[bank robber] Get in there.
Move! Move!

201
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:33,621
Get into the vault.

202
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:40,093
...because of your heroism
and your loyalty, brother.

203
00:17:42,564 --> 00:17:44,666
But I've got no room
for dead weight.

204
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:47,802
What-- What happened
to no man left behind?

205
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,139
They left us all behind.

206
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:20,334
[hostages screaming]

207
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,608
[muffled screaming]

208
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:28,776
[explosion]

209
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,377
[priest] I need more men.

210
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,314
[police radio chatter]

211
00:18:40,655 --> 00:18:42,790
[siren wailing in distance]
[nurse over PA] <i>Dr. Kravitz,</i>

212
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:44,859
<i>you have a visitor</i>
<i>in the main hall.</i>

213
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,829
[Fitzgerald sighs]

214
00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:49,797
[phone vibrating]

215
00:18:55,637 --> 00:18:58,338
[clears throat] What,
you in the Christmas spirit?

216
00:18:58,372 --> 00:19:01,241
<i>You're gonna drop the charges</i>
<i>on my partner?</i>

217
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:02,677
'Tis the season.

218
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,912
<i>He did the right thing, Cap.</i>

219
00:19:04,946 --> 00:19:07,481
Look,
I try and write him letters.

220
00:19:07,515 --> 00:19:09,751
I try and call him.
He won't speak to me.

221
00:19:09,784 --> 00:19:11,552
He won't let me tell him that--

222
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:17,424
He did what every partner
should do and had my back.

223
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,326
He ignored due process.

224
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:22,362
He desecrated
the oath he took.

225
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:24,666
<i>Yeah, Knight would call that</i>
<i>a good day's work.</i>

226
00:19:27,602 --> 00:19:29,537
You following
the Christmas bomber?

227
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,774
What, you're gonna pin
all that shit on him too?

228
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:34,408
<i>I'm out of cards to play.</i>

229
00:19:35,543 --> 00:19:37,377
FBI, CIA...

230
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:38,846
[sighs]

231
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,447
...nobody has any leads.

232
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,850
<i>We ran a gait analysis,</i>

233
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:45,553
<i>ran every shell fired</i>
<i>through IBIS.</i>

234
00:19:45,586 --> 00:19:47,789
<i>Nothing.</i>
<i>This guy's a ghost.</i>

235
00:19:47,822 --> 00:19:50,725
<i>But Knight has done more</i>
<i>with less.</i>

236
00:19:50,758 --> 00:19:52,527
You and I both know

237
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,227
Knight would say yes
to joining the hunt.
<i>No, no, no.</i>

238
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:56,463
Knight has dedicated his life
to this job.

239
00:19:56,496 --> 00:20:00,333
<i>He lost his wife,</i>
<i>his relationship with his kid,</i>

240
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,636
and his freedom.

241
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:03,671
And if he catches the bomber,

242
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:05,973
maybe he gets
one of those three back.

243
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:10,511
Don't turn him into a monster
just to catch a monster.

244
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:14,414
I got a city too scared
to leave their houses.

245
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,719
I got a madman blowing up banks
on Christmas.

246
00:20:17,752 --> 00:20:19,554
<i>And I got a mayor that--</i>

247
00:20:19,587 --> 00:20:21,354
[sighs] <i>Never mind.</i>

248
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,457
No, no, no.
Finish that sentence.

249
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,459
What-- What about the mayor?

250
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:26,961
<i>Forget what I said</i>
<i>about the mayor.</i>

251
00:20:26,994 --> 00:20:29,731
And don't you even think
about coming to New York.

252
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:54,287
Padre... [chuckles]
...what brings you down here?

253
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:57,390
Hi, Warden.
How's your night going?
Terrible.

254
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:59,827
Seems like it's a damn sight
better than yours?

255
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:03,698
[chuckles]
You're very intuitive.
Yeah.

256
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:05,700
I don't know
what I'm doing out here
this time of night.

257
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:07,334
I know it's a mistake.

258
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:09,302
[sighs]

259
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:11,506
I had a dream.

260
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,008
Yeah, about the guys.

261
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:16,443
About some of the men
in prison. I was--

262
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:18,913
I just wanna check on them,
make sure they're okay.

263
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:22,482
You had a dream?
Like a-- Like a premonition?

264
00:21:22,517 --> 00:21:25,485
Like a-- Like a vision.

265
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,856
So, what prisoner
are we dreaming about?

266
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:31,526
All of 'em.

267
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,662
All of them?
Yeah.

268
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:36,964
Yeah,
I know this was a mistake. I--

269
00:21:36,998 --> 00:21:39,734
If they see me out here,
they're gonna think
something's amiss.

270
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:41,936
That's gonna create
all kinds of drama.
I didn't want that.

271
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:44,038
I think you're right there.
I think you're right.

272
00:21:44,071 --> 00:21:46,841
Yeah. No.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

273
00:21:47,742 --> 00:21:49,110
The security center.

274
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:51,012
[chuckles]
I could look
through the monitors.

275
00:21:51,045 --> 00:21:53,114
They wouldn't see me.
It would set my mind at ease.

276
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:54,682
I would feel so much better.

277
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:55,750
No.

278
00:21:57,819 --> 00:21:59,821
Yeah, yeah. You're right.

279
00:22:02,623 --> 00:22:04,592
[warden] Padre.

280
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,828
Yeah?
Come on. It's Christmas.

281
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:09,730
Let's take a look, shall we?

282
00:22:09,764 --> 00:22:11,532
Okay. [chuckles]

283
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:13,901
Yeah.
Let's take a look.

284
00:22:13,935 --> 00:22:16,336
You're a good man.
I know.

285
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,982
All present
and accounted for.

286
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:29,917
Of course they are.

287
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:34,722
I run a tighter ship
than Lord Nelson ever did.
[chuckles]

288
00:22:34,755 --> 00:22:38,358
Now, Father Conlan,
what was your vision?

289
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:40,962
Oh,

290
00:22:40,995 --> 00:22:43,831
I envisioned your death.

291
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:45,498
[gunshot]
[grunts]

292
00:22:57,444 --> 00:22:59,180
[PA squeaks]

293
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:01,148
[Conlan on PA]
<i>Can I have your attention,</i>
<i>my brothers?</i>

294
00:23:01,949 --> 00:23:04,484
I bring you
great Christmas tidings.

295
00:23:08,455 --> 00:23:09,891
[gate buzzes]

296
00:23:13,628 --> 00:23:15,162
[prisoners cheering]

297
00:23:15,196 --> 00:23:19,399
[Conlan on PA] <i>Today is</i>
<i>the beginning of the liberation.</i>

298
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:22,803
<i>So prepare yourselves.</i>

299
00:23:24,705 --> 00:23:26,841
Hmm. [chuckles]

300
00:23:28,643 --> 00:23:30,678
[groans]

301
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:31,812
Let it begin.

302
00:23:34,048 --> 00:23:36,083
[prisoners chattering]

303
00:23:59,774 --> 00:24:01,809
[prisoners chattering, shouting]

304
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,935
[prisoner grunting]

305
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:30,504
[Conlan] Where are you,
Brother Rhodes?

306
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:32,740
[grunting]

307
00:24:35,276 --> 00:24:36,744
Hey, man.

308
00:24:36,777 --> 00:24:38,579
[both grunt]

309
00:24:38,612 --> 00:24:39,914
[grunts]
You all right?

310
00:24:39,947 --> 00:24:42,583
Yeah, yeah. [grunting]
Yeah.

311
00:24:49,724 --> 00:24:51,559
[all grunting]

312
00:25:01,302 --> 00:25:03,938
And unto you,
this day was born a savior.

313
00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:08,509
And the wages of sin is death.

314
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:11,545
And freedom is a gift.

315
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:13,848
You have incarcerated
your brothers

316
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:17,818
which is not abided by--
by any other species.

317
00:25:19,086 --> 00:25:20,988
So today,

318
00:25:21,022 --> 00:25:23,991
I give the gift of freedom
to my brothers.

319
00:25:24,025 --> 00:25:26,560
Because freedom is
their birthright.

320
00:25:26,594 --> 00:25:29,530
Freedom is what we will take.

321
00:25:30,598 --> 00:25:33,034
Merry Christmas, motherfuckers!

322
00:25:33,067 --> 00:25:35,770

You can leave.

I thought you'd split
with the rest of 'em. [sighs]

334
00:26:27,955 --> 00:26:32,026
A good bed is, uh--
is hard to find.

335
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:34,862
I need your read on a suspect.

336
00:26:34,895 --> 00:26:39,200
Tell me what every cop
and profiler from Quantico
to Camp Perry isn't seeing.

337
00:26:41,102 --> 00:26:43,804
His real name is
Richard Ricky Conlan.

338
00:26:43,838 --> 00:26:46,040
Conlan was Special Ops.

339
00:26:46,508 --> 00:26:48,109
Then he went rogue.

340
00:26:48,142 --> 00:26:50,911
<i>He fought with his CO,</i>
<i>got court-martialed,</i>

341
00:26:50,945 --> 00:26:52,980
<i>sentenced to seven years</i>
<i>in supermax.</i>

342
00:26:53,013 --> 00:26:56,150
<i>While inside,</i>
<i>Conlan's son was killed</i>
<i>in action</i>

343
00:26:56,183 --> 00:26:58,719
<i>and he was refused permission</i>
<i>to attend the funeral.</i>

344
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:01,789
Somewhere in there,
he discovered
his spiritual side.

345
00:27:01,822 --> 00:27:03,724
Got out ten years ago.

346
00:27:03,757 --> 00:27:06,961
Ever since,
Conlan's been working
as a prison counselor.

347
00:27:06,994 --> 00:27:09,763
<i>Everyone we speak to says</i>
<i>he's a pillar of the community.</i>

348
00:27:09,797 --> 00:27:12,333
Best thing since Mr. Rogers.

349
00:27:12,366 --> 00:27:17,004
Now that he's been ID'ed,
FBI link him for 21 homicides,

350
00:27:17,037 --> 00:27:18,839
eight armed bank robberies.

351
00:27:19,974 --> 00:27:21,809
Never showed his face
before last night,

352
00:27:21,842 --> 00:27:24,445
when he busted out your bestie,
Casey Rhodes,

353
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:26,680
and other hard-core degenerates.

354
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:30,151
Why didn't you break out?

355
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:38,058
[scoffs]
I'm wasting my time here.

356
00:27:38,092 --> 00:27:42,029
Whenever I had a tough case,
I remind myself one thing.

357
00:27:42,963 --> 00:27:44,732
What?

358
00:27:44,765 --> 00:27:48,102
Everyone bleeds.
You can't be saying
shit like that.

359
00:27:48,135 --> 00:27:52,139
You are about to stand trial
for the murder of two suspects.

360
00:27:52,173 --> 00:27:53,474
I killed more than two.

361
00:27:53,508 --> 00:27:56,076
Okay, that is not something
to be proud of.

362
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,045
I killed some bad guys.

363
00:28:01,248 --> 00:28:02,783
It was a good day.

364
00:28:02,816 --> 00:28:04,485
Everyone has a right
to due process.

365
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:08,255
You swore an oath
to serve and protect.

366
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:09,456
I own what I did.

367
00:28:10,891 --> 00:28:13,894
You're a disgrace.
You're a vigilante.

368
00:28:13,928 --> 00:28:15,696
Why didn't you break out?

369
00:28:21,302 --> 00:28:22,336
I'm a cop.

370
00:28:23,437 --> 00:28:25,272
It's how I'm wired.

371
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:26,907
I believe in the rule
of the law.

372
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:29,276
You are not a cop.

373
00:28:30,044 --> 00:28:32,379
You are a criminal
who had a badge

374
00:28:32,413 --> 00:28:35,282
and thought it gave him
the right to do
whatever the hell he wanted.

375
00:28:38,152 --> 00:28:39,220
I need your help.

376
00:28:41,922 --> 00:28:45,259
I need you to pretend
to be a cop one more time.

377
00:28:47,428 --> 00:28:48,462
I don't like you.

378
00:28:49,997 --> 00:28:52,233
I don't respect you.

379
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:54,368
But you can do things
I cannot do.

380
00:28:56,203 --> 00:28:57,438
In another life,

381
00:28:58,872 --> 00:28:59,940
Conlan is you.

382
00:29:01,475 --> 00:29:04,211
The drive,
the self-righteousness.

383
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:07,448
[sighs]

384
00:29:07,481 --> 00:29:09,183
Stop Ricky Conlan

385
00:29:09,216 --> 00:29:12,186
and the DA will drop
all charges against you.

386
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,389
Why me?

387
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:18,092
'Cause you could have broke out
with the rest of the guys
in your cell block

388
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:19,493
and you chose not to.

389
00:29:21,195 --> 00:29:22,496
You chose to do the right thing.

390
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:27,401
You're no better
than the guys you killed
or locked up,

391
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,803
but there's still good in you.

392
00:29:29,837 --> 00:29:32,039
And because you're
the only guy I know

393
00:29:32,072 --> 00:29:33,874
who might be crazier
than Ricky is.

394
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:36,143
I am flattered.

395
00:29:36,176 --> 00:29:38,312
But understand this.

396
00:29:38,345 --> 00:29:42,584
He's not robbing banks.
He's putting on a show.

397
00:29:42,617 --> 00:29:43,851
How do you know that?

398
00:29:43,884 --> 00:29:45,520
Think like a criminal.

399
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,022
It tracks.

400
00:29:48,055 --> 00:29:49,256
Any leads?

401
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:52,459
Wanna hear a bad joke?

402
00:29:52,493 --> 00:29:54,161
Always.

403
00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:58,165
When the last bank was hit
in Midtown,

404
00:30:00,034 --> 00:30:02,169
someone had an appointment
with the manager

405
00:30:02,202 --> 00:30:04,305
at the same time
and didn't show.

406
00:30:04,338 --> 00:30:06,608
Guess who it was.
The pope?

407
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:08,442
Close.

408
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:10,444
Vassetti.
The mayor.

409
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:12,212
One and only.

410
00:30:12,246 --> 00:30:14,081
Someone tipped him off.

411
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:16,817
Yeah.

412
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,498
[sighs]

413
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:43,977
Tell me I'm not
making the worst decision
of my life.

414
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:47,448
I wanna catch this guy.

415
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:51,519
Give me my gun,
and I'll do the rest.

416
00:30:51,553 --> 00:30:55,456
Conlan comes to me alive.
Got it?

417
00:30:55,489 --> 00:30:58,359
James Knight
versus a psychotic bank robber.

418
00:30:59,627 --> 00:31:02,597
Let's hope
the city's still standing
come Christmas morning.

419
00:31:04,064 --> 00:31:07,368
[piano playing]
[horn honks in distance]

420
00:31:13,941 --> 00:31:15,409
[Rhodes] He seems
like a lot of fun.

421
00:31:15,442 --> 00:31:17,277
He's probably a Jets fan.

422
00:31:17,311 --> 00:31:19,480
[scoffs]

423
00:31:19,514 --> 00:31:22,316
Look, I'm not really
into this cult shit.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

424
00:31:22,349 --> 00:31:23,917
[Conlan laughs]
[piano stops]

425
00:31:23,951 --> 00:31:26,053
How are the libations,
my brothers?

426
00:31:26,086 --> 00:31:27,354
[Mercer whispers] Let's go.

427
00:31:27,388 --> 00:31:28,956
Hear what he has to say
and leave?

428
00:31:28,989 --> 00:31:31,925
When that man speaks,
you listen.

429
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:38,999
Dajon barks like a dog,
but he's a loyal one.

430
00:31:46,641 --> 00:31:47,675
My brothers...

431
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:53,581
the time is upon us
for the great liberation.

432
00:31:53,615 --> 00:31:58,018
But I ask you one small favor.

433
00:31:58,051 --> 00:31:59,654
I ask you to trust.

434
00:32:00,588 --> 00:32:04,024
Trust that together
we can change the world.

435
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:06,994
Trust that when we move as one,

436
00:32:07,027 --> 00:32:13,167
that those sheep out there
will tremble in fear
at the sight of us.

437
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:19,440
There are more people
in prison in this country

438
00:32:19,473 --> 00:32:22,042
than any other nation
on the planet.

439
00:32:22,075 --> 00:32:27,981
74% of souls in cages
haven't even been convicted

440
00:32:28,015 --> 00:32:29,717
of a crime.

441
00:32:29,751 --> 00:32:34,288
They're in there
because they can't afford
to pay bail.

442
00:32:34,321 --> 00:32:39,059
They can't even
pay their mortgage, their rent,

443
00:32:39,092 --> 00:32:42,664
while their brothers
in their mansions laugh at them.

444
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:46,534
We're persecuting the poor.

445
00:32:46,568 --> 00:32:48,368
It makes my blood boil.

446
00:32:51,238 --> 00:32:53,207
And I was a soldier
for this country.

447
00:32:55,075 --> 00:32:58,178
I spilled blood in countries
you can't even find on a map.

448
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:05,385
They asked me to execute people
who did not deserve to die.

449
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:09,456
And when I stood against them,
they threw me in a cage too.

450
00:33:10,457 --> 00:33:11,659
Yes, they did.

451
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:16,063
And then when my son died
in combat...

452
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:24,104
[sniffles, sobs]

453
00:33:24,137 --> 00:33:27,274
...I couldn't even see
my own son's body
be lowered into the ground.

454
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:31,078
Tell me that's not cruel.

455
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:34,214
Tell me that's not torture.

456
00:33:37,251 --> 00:33:43,490
The corruption of this sick
and diseased civilization,

457
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:46,594
we have to wipe it out.

458
00:33:46,628 --> 00:33:50,197
We have to burn their sick egos
to the ground

459
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:54,468
and raise this whole country
and start fresh and anew.

460
00:33:58,138 --> 00:34:00,107
Look at this holiday.

461
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,476
Christmas. [laughs]

462
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,278
They've perverted
this holiday.

463
00:34:04,311 --> 00:34:08,148
They've turned it into
a giant mall of consumerism.

464
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:11,418
We have to take it back.
We have to make it ours.

465
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:15,023
This blessed day
will no longer be corrupted
by their ugliness.

466
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,125
We will bring that change.

467
00:34:18,158 --> 00:34:20,728
Because this is war.

468
00:34:20,762 --> 00:34:22,597
And there will be no prisoners.

469
00:34:24,298 --> 00:34:26,099
And when they think
of Christmas...

470
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:29,537
...they will think of us.

471
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:37,477
But those of you
who do not want to be here
for this great liberation...

472
00:34:39,814 --> 00:34:41,148
...there's the door.

473
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:54,494
No offense, no disrespect,
but, uh, yeah, fellas, I'm out.
<i>Feliz Navidad.</i>

474
00:34:54,529 --> 00:34:55,663
Pussy.

475
00:34:55,697 --> 00:34:59,266
No, no, no. No, Dajon.
[door opens]

476
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:01,435
That man wants to be free.
[door closes]

477
00:35:01,468 --> 00:35:03,470
And our gift to him
is his freedom.

478
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:07,809
Just make sure he finds
the right way out.

479
00:35:11,913 --> 00:35:14,849
[door opens]
[footsteps recede]

480
00:35:14,882 --> 00:35:16,851
Celebrate tonight, my brothers.

481
00:35:18,352 --> 00:35:20,153
Tomorrow, we begin.

482
00:35:25,258 --> 00:35:26,460
Brother Rhodes.

483
00:35:27,595 --> 00:35:28,630
You're not drinking.

484
00:35:29,797 --> 00:35:31,666
No. No, I'm, uh--

485
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:33,801
You know, I'm not thirsty, so...

486
00:35:34,669 --> 00:35:35,737
Don't lie to me.

487
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:41,208
Don't lie to me
and don't ever cover for anyone.

488
00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:48,415
Uh, Father, uh...

489
00:35:48,448 --> 00:35:50,652
[clears throat]
A favor to ask you.
No.

490
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:53,588
Don't even know
what I'm gonna ask you.

491
00:35:53,621 --> 00:35:55,923
You wanna call your family
and tell them you're okay.

492
00:35:57,224 --> 00:35:58,626
No.

493
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:03,363
What if I make a trade with you?
[packet crinkles]

494
00:36:06,433 --> 00:36:08,970
[Conlan laughs]

495
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:12,540
You've realized you're more
than your addiction.

496
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:14,776
Very good.

497
00:36:16,878 --> 00:36:18,445
Make it quick.

498
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:28,756
Nice speech.

499
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:33,828
You'll have a nice day
on the swings.
It's gonna be so fun.

500
00:36:33,861 --> 00:36:34,896
Yeah.

501
00:36:35,563 --> 00:36:36,964
God.

502
00:36:36,998 --> 00:36:38,733
Look,
stop following us, okay?

503
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:40,568
I don't know where Casey is.

504
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:43,938
Ugh. I'm sorry, honey.

505
00:36:43,971 --> 00:36:45,372
It's okay.

506
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:47,542
[sighs] Are you okay?

507
00:36:47,575 --> 00:36:49,309
Yeah.
Yeah?

508
00:36:51,045 --> 00:36:54,281
Well, I had a nightmare.

509
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:56,617
Yeah?

510
00:36:56,651 --> 00:36:59,486
Daddy never came home
because he was drowning.

511
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,623
I tried to save him,
but I couldn't.

512
00:37:02,657 --> 00:37:04,424
[sighs]

513
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:06,594
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

514
00:37:06,627 --> 00:37:08,696
Can I call him?

515
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,297
Not today.

516
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:11,899
There's gonna be no crying
in this household

517
00:37:11,933 --> 00:37:13,333
over Daddy, okay?
[phone vibrating]

518
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:14,736
Okay.
Okay?

519
00:37:14,769 --> 00:37:16,838
Mommy is getting a phone call.
But go-- go play.

520
00:37:16,871 --> 00:37:17,905
Okay.

521
00:37:18,573 --> 00:37:19,674
[sighs]

522
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:27,014
Hello?
[Rhodes] <i>Hello, this is from the</i>
<i>department of absentee fathers.</i>

523
00:37:27,048 --> 00:37:28,516
Calling again.

524
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:29,917
Hi, Mom.

525
00:37:30,518 --> 00:37:32,653
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

526
00:37:32,687 --> 00:37:34,421
[sighs]
How are you holding up?

527
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:36,524
Not great.

528
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:39,292
How is she doing?

529
00:37:39,326 --> 00:37:42,496
[sighs] She's confused.

00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,832
<i>More questions every day,</i>
<i>wondering where her dad is,</i>

531
00:37:44,866 --> 00:37:48,301
<i>and why I don't let her</i>
<i>watch the TV.</i>

532
00:37:49,103 --> 00:37:51,806
Look, please don't tell me
that you're--

533
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,508
you're part of the jailbreak.

534
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:55,009
[Rhodes sighs]

535
00:37:55,042 --> 00:37:58,713
I, uh, kind of got mixed up
in it, darling.

536
00:37:58,746 --> 00:38:01,381
<i>I don't know how it happened,</i>
<i>but...</i>

537
00:38:03,017 --> 00:38:05,653
[sighs]
...I couldn't spend
another day in that cell.

538
00:38:05,686 --> 00:38:07,655
How could you be so stupid?

539
00:38:07,688 --> 00:38:09,924
Pretty much used up
all the stupid
getting this far, huh?

540
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:15,530
They say the guy
who orchestrated the jailbreak
is-- is the Christmas bomber.

541
00:38:15,563 --> 00:38:18,933
<i>Honestly, I'd rather you be</i>
<i>inside and alive than--</i>

542
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:20,067
Instead of what?

543
00:38:21,068 --> 00:38:23,938
Dead?
Inside is pretty much
the same exact thing.

544
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:26,541
Ugh, God.

545
00:38:26,574 --> 00:38:28,576
I just feel like you don't--
you don't think.

546
00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:30,611
You don't think at all.
You don't fucking think.

547
00:38:30,645 --> 00:38:32,713
No, I can fix this, darling.
<i>No, you can't.</i>

548
00:38:32,747 --> 00:38:35,415
You can't fucking fix this.

549
00:38:35,448 --> 00:38:40,721
You sound like an addict.
<i>I'm with Conlan right now, okay?</i>
<i>I can maybe cut a deal.</i>

550
00:38:40,755 --> 00:38:43,591
I need you to call the police,
tell them what
I just told you, okay?

553
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:55,036
I love you.

554
00:38:57,738 --> 00:38:58,940

Casey Rhodes.

557
00:39:28,903 --> 00:39:30,805
We had such high hopes for you.

558
00:39:37,945 --> 00:39:38,980
What?

559
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:41,048
Put her through.

560
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:45,920
[sighs]
Mrs. Rhodes,
what can I do for you?

561
00:39:45,953 --> 00:39:48,856
<i>Casey called me.</i>
<i>He's with the bomber.</i>

562
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,490
When did you talk to him?

563
00:39:50,524 --> 00:39:52,727
<i>Just now.</i>
Did he give you an address?

564
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,063
<i>Look, I need your word</i>
<i>that all the charges</i>
<i>against Casey will be dropped.</i>

565
00:39:56,097 --> 00:39:58,666
<i>Full immunity.</i>
I can say with confidence

566
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:02,703
that the mayor
and the DA's office
would be willing to cut a deal.

567
00:40:02,737 --> 00:40:05,472
<i>Send me something in writing,</i>
<i>and I'll send you the address.</i>

573
00:40:58,626 --> 00:41:01,228

Hold it right there!

00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:15,109
[Knight] This was his B team.

578
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:17,578
Conlan left 20 minutes
before we showed up.

579
00:41:17,611 --> 00:41:19,113
He might have been tipped off.

580
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:21,148
[captain] <i>I put my ass</i>
<i>on the line for you.</i>

581
00:41:21,182 --> 00:41:23,017
I got you out to get results.

00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:26,921
His team prepped here.
They paid cash.

The landlord has no idea. None.

<i>They don't know where he is.</i>

585
00:41:32,827 --> 00:41:35,262
Conlan is always one step ahead.

586
00:41:35,296 --> 00:41:36,998
Do the Feds have anything?

587
00:41:37,031 --> 00:41:38,933
<i>They know less than we do.</i>

588
00:41:38,966 --> 00:41:41,635
<i>There's only one witness</i>
<i>that we haven't questioned.</i>

589
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:46,273
We cannot get
the mayor involved.

590
00:41:46,307 --> 00:41:48,676
You said to do
whatever it takes.

591
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,012
This is what it takes.

592
00:41:51,846 --> 00:41:52,947
[sighs]

593
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,986
All right, I'll--
I'll meet with him, okay?

594
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,721
You're a good one, Captain.

595
00:42:01,922 --> 00:42:03,290
Don't I know it.

[cello playing "Deck the Halls"]

00:42:37,124 --> 00:42:39,226
Hey, my son plays the cello.

598
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:42,830
Yeah, you're pretty good at it.
[cello stops]

599
00:42:42,863 --> 00:42:45,332
No, no, don't--
don't stop, please.

600
00:42:45,366 --> 00:42:47,968
You try playing for four hours.

601
00:42:48,002 --> 00:42:50,371
Uh, that'll be a hard pass.

602
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:52,073
Exactly.

603
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,241
You a cop?

604
00:42:55,976 --> 00:42:57,344
Why?

605
00:42:58,012 --> 00:42:59,580
Fuck the police.

606
00:43:04,819 --> 00:43:06,020

00:43:39,386 --> 00:43:43,057
[parent] Arthur,
we need to discuss
where you were last night.

609
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:45,426
We're gonna have
to have a conversation.

610

Welcome to my home, sir.

[clears throat]

614
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,375
Anyone thinking of donating
to the city,

615
00:44:01,408 --> 00:44:03,244
well, is a friend of mine.

616
00:44:04,211 --> 00:44:05,412
Ah, yeah.

617
00:44:05,446 --> 00:44:07,915
Yeah, that was just a lie

618
00:44:07,948 --> 00:44:11,719
so I was able to get
an appointment with you
on shorter notice.

619
00:44:11,752 --> 00:44:13,687
I'm not even a constituent.

620
00:44:13,721 --> 00:44:15,689
And I definitely wouldn't
vote for you.

621
00:44:15,723 --> 00:44:20,327
But I do have this.

622
00:44:22,062 --> 00:44:23,264
Los Angeles.

623
00:44:23,297 --> 00:44:25,266
You're out of your jurisdiction.

624
00:44:25,299 --> 00:44:26,834
And you're wasting my time.

625
00:44:26,867 --> 00:44:29,069
And you're letting
a madman blow up banks.

626
00:44:29,103 --> 00:44:31,438
So I guess you and I
have a lot to talk about.

627
00:44:31,472 --> 00:44:34,275
[clears throat]
[chuckles]

628
00:44:34,308 --> 00:44:37,244
Man, I wish I had a seat
at your weekly poker game,

629
00:44:37,278 --> 00:44:39,980
because you lie for shit.

630
00:44:40,014 --> 00:44:43,417
Now, why did you miss
your appointment at the bank

631
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:45,052
the day that it was blowing up?

632
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:47,087
Midtown traffic.

633
00:44:47,988 --> 00:44:49,456
What was the appointment for?

634
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:52,159
Hmm? What, you need a loan?

635
00:44:52,193 --> 00:44:56,964
I was, uh,
looking to close out
my safety deposit box.

636
00:44:58,299 --> 00:45:00,935
And Ricky Conlan beat you to it.

637
00:45:00,968 --> 00:45:02,870
Hmm.
What was in it?

638
00:45:03,971 --> 00:45:06,373
Nothing of importance.
Come on.

639
00:45:06,407 --> 00:45:08,475
No blood diamonds?

640
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:11,979
No photos of you
in a little white robe
with a little pointy hat?

641
00:45:13,247 --> 00:45:14,281
No.

642
00:45:15,149 --> 00:45:18,052
Come on. What does Conlan have
on you, huh?

643
00:45:18,085 --> 00:45:19,887
Video of you fucking the maid?

Arthur?

646
00:45:26,126 --> 00:45:27,194
Again, please.

647
00:45:28,362 --> 00:45:30,130
Really sweet kid.

00:45:30,164 --> 00:45:31,533
[cello playing resumes]

649
00:45:31,566 --> 00:45:34,502
Well, I need to prepare
for my press conference.

650
00:45:34,536 --> 00:45:38,339
Of course.
You gotta rehearse
all that bullshit.

651
00:45:38,372 --> 00:45:40,841
Thank you
for your service, Officer.

652
00:45:40,874 --> 00:45:43,277
Actually, that's "Detective."

653
00:45:44,411 --> 00:45:46,447
I'm sorry
I couldn't be more help.

654
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,015
Oh, don't be sorry.

655
00:45:48,048 --> 00:45:49,950
No, you were
a great deal of help.

656
00:45:51,118 --> 00:45:52,419
After you.

657
00:45:58,025 --> 00:46:00,861
[clears throat]
Oh, you know what?
[chuckles]

658
00:46:00,894 --> 00:46:03,364
No, ah,
there's just, um--

659
00:46:03,397 --> 00:46:05,232
I just have one more thing.

660
00:46:05,266 --> 00:46:08,836
Mm-hmm.
Do you still have
safety deposit boxes?

661
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:10,471
Now, why would you
want to know that?

662
00:46:10,505 --> 00:46:13,841
Ah, just after Conlan's heist,
where did you move them to?

663
00:46:13,874 --> 00:46:16,477
I consolidated them
into one location.

664
00:46:16,511 --> 00:46:18,279
And where would that be?

665
00:46:19,614 --> 00:46:21,448
An impenetrable bank.

666
00:46:22,517 --> 00:46:24,852
Few know the actual location.

667
00:46:26,186 --> 00:46:30,124
Consider it a Fort Knox
for the 1%.

668
00:46:30,157 --> 00:46:33,827
Ah. Well, Mr. Mayor,

669
00:46:33,861 --> 00:46:37,498
I think that you and I are
gonna be seeing
a lot of each other.

670
00:46:39,133 --> 00:46:40,401
I look forward to it.

671
00:46:41,235 --> 00:46:42,269
Good.

672
00:46:44,905 --> 00:46:46,273
[grunts]

673
00:46:47,308 --> 00:46:48,876
Oh, and, uh,

674
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:51,111
what's your wrist size,
Mr. Mayor?

675
00:46:51,145 --> 00:46:54,948
I'd love to send you a nice
little fuzzy pair of handcuffs
for Christmas.

676
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:02,022
You can keep the itinerary.

677
00:47:02,056 --> 00:47:03,090
Blow me.

678
00:47:14,968 --> 00:47:17,004
[police radio chatter]

679
00:47:28,982 --> 00:47:30,150
What the--

680
00:47:31,318 --> 00:47:33,287
How'd you get in here?

681
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,590
Well, that's between me
and the door.

682
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:41,663
Get out from behind my desk.
I asked you a ques-- Oh.

683
00:47:41,696 --> 00:47:43,464
You're in a wheelchair.

684
00:47:43,497 --> 00:47:45,999
Bullets didn't hit my spine,
so if I stay off my feet,

685
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:47,669
I'll be up and running
by Memorial Day.

686
00:47:47,702 --> 00:47:50,304
[sighs] How the hell did you
get in here?

687
00:47:50,337 --> 00:47:55,008
Yeah, well, you're a detective.
You figure it out.

688
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:58,479
You flew all the way
from LA to New York
to bust into my office?

689
00:47:58,513 --> 00:48:01,348
Oh, and I might as well
tell you now,

690
00:48:01,382 --> 00:48:03,518
because you will find out.

691
00:48:03,551 --> 00:48:05,687
I paid a visit to the mayor.

692
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,589
Man, I can't believe...
[cell phone pings]

693
00:48:07,622 --> 00:48:10,958
...he's such a bad liar.
He's made it so far in politics.

694
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:13,394
[scoffs]
Now he's messaging me,

695
00:48:13,427 --> 00:48:16,564
asking me why some LA cop
is asking him questions.

696
00:48:16,598 --> 00:48:17,998
Because he's involved.

697
00:48:18,031 --> 00:48:19,601
[sighs]

698
00:48:20,769 --> 00:48:24,371
This could be
the biggest scandal
in the history of the city.

699
00:48:24,405 --> 00:48:27,074
I know Conlan's got
something on the mayor.

700
00:48:27,107 --> 00:48:30,678
Let's just hope if
Knight finds out what it is,
he'll do the right thing.

701
00:48:30,712 --> 00:48:33,414
Yeah, Knight will play
by the book.

702
00:48:33,447 --> 00:48:35,349
I have a feeling his
definition of "by the book"

703
00:48:35,382 --> 00:48:38,686
is to beat a guy to death
with a book.

704
00:48:40,622 --> 00:48:42,289
Find anything on Conlan?

705
00:48:42,322 --> 00:48:43,490
No.

706
00:48:43,525 --> 00:48:45,560
He wants to rid the world
of money,

707
00:48:45,593 --> 00:48:47,428
yet he is playing Santa Claus.

708
00:48:47,461 --> 00:48:49,263
He does one thing, says another.

709
00:48:49,296 --> 00:48:53,066
I think that he wants the world
to believe he's an animal.

710
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:56,069
So find out
who's holding the leash.

711
00:48:56,103 --> 00:48:57,438
Yes, ma'am.

712
00:48:58,673 --> 00:49:02,510
The first question is,
where is my partner?

713
00:49:03,678 --> 00:49:06,180
You're a detective.
Figure it out.

714
00:49:08,449 --> 00:49:09,483
[chuckles]

715
00:49:09,517 --> 00:49:11,485
Thank you all for coming.

716
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:14,388
I am putting Ricky Conlan
on notice.

717
00:49:14,421 --> 00:49:16,390
We will apprehend you.

718
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:20,394
I am also putting
the police department

719
00:49:20,427 --> 00:49:23,464
<i>and Captain Anna Shea</i>
<i>on notice.</i>

720
00:49:23,497 --> 00:49:26,467
<i>I will come after you</i>
<i>if you fail in your directive.</i>

721
00:49:26,501 --> 00:49:29,269
[voices chanting, echoing]
<i>Ho! Ho!</i>

722
00:49:29,303 --> 00:49:31,773
[Vassetti] <i>Ricky Conlan is not</i>
<i>some sort of Robin Hood.</i>

723
00:49:31,806 --> 00:49:33,073
[Conlan] <i>Get down!</i>

724
00:49:33,106 --> 00:49:34,241
[all scream]

725
00:49:34,274 --> 00:49:36,310
Merry fucking Christmas!

726
00:49:36,343 --> 00:49:37,545
[Dajon] Eyes on the ground.

727
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:39,413
You understand the problem?

728
00:49:39,446 --> 00:49:42,249
You wanna see my face?
Look at me, motherfucker!

729
00:49:42,282 --> 00:49:43,685
Don't move!

730
00:49:43,718 --> 00:49:47,087
[Conlan] I want my present!

731
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,423
He's a criminal
of the lowest kind.

732
00:49:49,456 --> 00:49:52,226
I am here to save you!

733
00:49:52,259 --> 00:49:54,361
Look at this god
you worship. Stand up.

734
00:49:55,462 --> 00:50:00,167
[panting] This is not Christmas!

735
00:50:02,236 --> 00:50:04,304
You wanna worship money
your whole life?

736
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:07,207
You see how well it spends
when you're in hell.

737
00:50:08,242 --> 00:50:11,144
Wait, no. I have a family.
[hostages scream, gasp]

738
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:13,247
Let's go.
[hostage crying]

739
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:18,185
[Vassetti] <i>I urge you not to buy</i>
<i>into his call to arms,</i>

740
00:50:18,218 --> 00:50:23,825
and see it as nothing
but a smoke screen
to hide his criminal activity.

741
00:50:23,858 --> 00:50:27,327
<i>He is recruiting ex-convicts.</i>

742
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:30,063
<i>He is attempting</i>
<i>to brainwash them...</i>
Merry Christmas.

743
00:50:30,097 --> 00:50:32,734
<i>...so they can join his cause.</i>
[grenade clatters on floor]

744
00:50:34,769 --> 00:50:38,205
If there is anyone found
aiding Ricky Conlan,

745
00:50:39,641 --> 00:50:41,609
<i>you will feel the full force</i>
<i>of this city</i>

746
00:50:41,643 --> 00:50:44,646
<i>brought to bear upon your heads.</i>

747
00:50:46,213 --> 00:50:48,048
<i>Now, if you have any questions,</i>

748
00:50:49,551 --> 00:50:52,620
<i>ask Captain Anna Shea</i>

749
00:50:52,654 --> 00:50:55,322
<i>and see what answers</i>
<i>she gives you. Thank you.</i>

750
00:50:56,791 --> 00:50:59,159
-Motherfucker!
-[grunts]

751
00:50:59,192 --> 00:51:00,460
You wanna sell us out?

752
00:51:00,494 --> 00:51:03,865
Sell out a great man
like Conlan?

753
00:51:03,898 --> 00:51:07,334
I heard you call
your ball and chain,
motherfucker.

754
00:51:07,367 --> 00:51:09,671
The fuck is wrong with you?

755
00:51:10,337 --> 00:51:12,472
Oh, it's a long list, brother.

756
00:51:14,876 --> 00:51:17,144
He could have done for you
what he did for me.

757
00:51:17,177 --> 00:51:19,614
He took me from the streets
and gave me purpose,

758
00:51:19,647 --> 00:51:21,315
made me real.

759
00:51:22,684 --> 00:51:25,285
Disappointment is
a hell of a thing.

760
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:32,292
Do unto others...
[groans]

761
00:51:32,326 --> 00:51:35,195
...as you would have them
do unto you.

762
00:51:35,228 --> 00:51:36,531
[Conlan chuckles]

763
00:51:36,564 --> 00:51:39,166
You wanted them
to shoot me down like a dog.

764
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:40,267
No.

765
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:42,436
Why did you try
to cut a deal?

766
00:51:42,469 --> 00:51:43,905
Come on,
you were gonna burn my ass

767
00:51:43,938 --> 00:51:45,472
to save yours, weren't you?

768
00:51:45,506 --> 00:51:47,140
No, no, no. That's not what--

769
00:51:47,174 --> 00:51:49,711
-Don't you lie to me.
-Okay.

770
00:51:49,744 --> 00:51:52,814
Yeah, okay. I may be a liar,
but I'm not fucking crazy.

771
00:51:53,915 --> 00:51:56,751
[Rhodes groaning]

772
00:51:56,784 --> 00:51:59,386
[Conlan]
Well, in a society like this,

773
00:51:59,419 --> 00:52:02,857
being crazy could be
a beautiful thing.

774
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:04,692
You know?
[panting]

775
00:52:04,726 --> 00:52:09,363
So let me ask you one more time.

776
00:52:11,264 --> 00:52:15,603
Did you try to cut a deal

777
00:52:15,637 --> 00:52:18,606
with the New York
pig department?
[groans, pants] F--

778
00:52:20,307 --> 00:52:22,409
[Conlan] All I'm asking for
is the truth.

779
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:25,780
All I want,
just the truth, son.

780
00:52:25,813 --> 00:52:29,316
Just fucking kill me, man.
Let's get it over with.

781
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:32,386
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

782
00:52:32,419 --> 00:52:34,454
You don't under--
This is not your fault.

783
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:36,958
No, no. Th--

784
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:39,661
This is part of
the great deception
of the liars.

785
00:52:39,694 --> 00:52:42,597
They used you
just like they used me.

786
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:43,965
Don't you see?

787
00:52:43,998 --> 00:52:46,433
They distracted us
with all the-- the splendor,

788
00:52:46,466 --> 00:52:48,301
and the gold, and the--
and the-- and the--

789
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:51,839
and the pageantry
and the theatrics. Right?

790
00:52:51,873 --> 00:52:54,642
"You're doing
such a good job, son.

791
00:52:54,676 --> 00:52:56,711
<i>Well done</i>
<i>servicing your country."</i>
[gunfire]

792
00:52:56,744 --> 00:52:59,413
[people clamor]
[Conlan] <i>Right? Patriotism,</i>
<i>xenophobia.</i>

793
00:52:59,446 --> 00:53:02,349
This jingoism
they filled in our heads,
and they walked us out there.

794
00:53:02,382 --> 00:53:03,951
And they gave you--

795
00:53:03,985 --> 00:53:06,253
They gave you a pigskin.

796
00:53:06,286 --> 00:53:08,388
And they said, "You carry it
from one end of the battlefield
to the other."

797
00:53:08,422 --> 00:53:10,958
And they handed me a rifle,
and they taught me how to kill.

798
00:53:10,992 --> 00:53:13,828
He knows things, man.
He's a truth teller.

799
00:53:13,861 --> 00:53:15,830
Hey, fuck you.

800
00:53:16,998 --> 00:53:19,299
[Conlan] No, no,
don't be angry at him.

801
00:53:19,332 --> 00:53:22,704
Come on. You're angry at the
system that left you deserted

802
00:53:22,737 --> 00:53:24,672
on the shores of poverty
and dissolution

803
00:53:24,706 --> 00:53:26,507
without a cause to believe in.

804
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:28,241
But I've got that fixed.
[groans]

805
00:53:28,275 --> 00:53:29,476
'Cause you and I are the same.

806
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:31,779
We're both from
the same society.

807
00:53:32,914 --> 00:53:35,783
We didn't do anything
wrong here. We're not criminals.

808
00:53:36,651 --> 00:53:38,720
We're protagonists
in our own story.

809
00:53:38,753 --> 00:53:40,988
[Rhodes] Sure, man. Yeah.

810
00:53:41,022 --> 00:53:44,224
I get it, that makes sense.
That makes sense, sure.

811
00:53:44,992 --> 00:53:46,561
I want the truth.

812
00:53:48,495 --> 00:53:51,566
[groans]
I want the truth.

813
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,266
[panting]

814
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:57,939
Your faith isn't strong enough
to get you to the next chapter,

815
00:53:57,972 --> 00:53:59,006
my son.

816
00:54:00,641 --> 00:54:02,977
[grunts] I got
to make you make a choice.

817
00:54:04,078 --> 00:54:05,613
I really hate doing this,

818
00:54:05,646 --> 00:54:07,280
but I have to
show you something.

819
00:54:07,314 --> 00:54:08,950
It's good. It's kind of bad.

820
00:54:08,983 --> 00:54:11,351
But one day, I promise,
you're gonna thank me for it.

821
00:54:19,627 --> 00:54:22,530
No. No, no, no! Fuck you!

822
00:54:22,563 --> 00:54:23,865
[panting] No!

823
00:54:23,898 --> 00:54:27,068
No, no, I tried--
I tried to fuck you, okay?

824
00:54:27,101 --> 00:54:29,302
I'm a piece of shit, okay?

825
00:54:29,336 --> 00:54:30,772
I'm-- I'm a drug addict.

826
00:54:30,805 --> 00:54:31,939
Just let them go.

827
00:54:31,973 --> 00:54:33,440
Fuck you! Let them go!

828
00:54:33,473 --> 00:54:34,909
Fuck you! Let them go!

829
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:36,611
[panting]
Shh.

830
00:54:43,383 --> 00:54:44,484
There you go.

831
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:46,353
There you go. Look at me.

832
00:54:46,386 --> 00:54:47,755
Look at me. Look at me.

833
00:54:57,999 --> 00:55:00,467
Okay, okay, okay.

834
00:55:00,501 --> 00:55:01,702
[Conlan laughs]

835
00:55:01,736 --> 00:55:03,805
That's the spirit.

836
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:07,708
But you shoot me, they all die.

837
00:55:08,509 --> 00:55:12,479
Okay? You shoot yourself,
they all die.

838
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:15,516
Okay, you have to
make a choice now.

839
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:18,085
You have to make a choice
so you can be free.

840
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:19,554
What's the choice?

841
00:55:20,555 --> 00:55:22,123
Bring him in.
What?

842
00:55:22,156 --> 00:55:24,125
[Conlan] Now make a decision
and set yourself free.

843
00:55:24,158 --> 00:55:25,726
Ah, fuck.

844
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,528
Oh, it's your brother.

845
00:55:27,562 --> 00:55:29,997
[Rhodes] He wasn't part of this.
This is me.

846
00:55:30,031 --> 00:55:31,933
[Conlan] This is the choice
that gives you your freedom.

847
00:55:31,966 --> 00:55:34,367
[Rhodes] I alerted the cops.
[Conlan] Your family
or your brother?

848
00:55:34,401 --> 00:55:36,504
Okay, we already know
what you're gonna choose.

849
00:55:36,537 --> 00:55:38,072
Right? Look what he's done
to you.

850
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,910
He brought you to the bookie
that you had to kill.

851
00:55:42,944 --> 00:55:45,445
He-- He got you to--
to rob banks.

852
00:55:45,478 --> 00:55:48,049
He taught you how to shoot
a gun. That's the guy.

853
00:55:48,082 --> 00:55:49,482
Hurry it up. We got
a world to save.

854
00:55:49,517 --> 00:55:51,451
Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

855
00:55:52,954 --> 00:55:54,722
Him or your family.

856
00:55:54,755 --> 00:55:56,557
One has to die.

857
00:55:56,591 --> 00:55:58,693
Come on, Casey. You've already
made your fucking decision.

858
00:55:58,726 --> 00:56:00,561
Come on.

859
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:03,764
Just do it.

860
00:56:04,665 --> 00:56:05,867
I'm sorry, man.

861
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,568
Fuck, I'm sorry, brother.
No, no.

862
00:56:09,003 --> 00:56:10,972
-I'm so sorry.
-No, no, no, no, no, no!

863
00:56:11,005 --> 00:56:12,405
[gun clicks]

864
00:56:13,574 --> 00:56:16,510
[laughing]

865
00:56:16,544 --> 00:56:17,812
Fuck.

866
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,414
I'm sorry, but I had to see.

867
00:56:21,448 --> 00:56:23,084
[Mercer] Well, fuck you, man.

868
00:56:23,117 --> 00:56:24,785
You sick fuck.

869
00:56:24,819 --> 00:56:26,419
You actually pulled the trigger?

870
00:56:26,453 --> 00:56:28,022
[Conlan] I had to know for sure.

871
00:56:28,055 --> 00:56:29,924
You are a true believer.

872
00:56:29,957 --> 00:56:31,192
I knew you had it in you.

873
00:56:31,225 --> 00:56:33,995
I am so goddamn proud of you.

874
00:56:34,762 --> 00:56:36,197
Oh, Casey.

875
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:37,531
My man.

876
00:56:39,834 --> 00:56:41,802
What's wrong with you
fucking people?

877
00:56:41,836 --> 00:56:43,470
Look, I woke up this morning

878
00:56:43,504 --> 00:56:45,539
and I thought, my God,
I have everything

879
00:56:45,573 --> 00:56:48,743
I need in my life
except one thing.

880
00:56:48,776 --> 00:56:51,646
[grunts] Yeah, what's that?

881
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:53,114
Your fucking sanity?

882
00:56:55,816 --> 00:56:56,918
You.

883
00:57:02,757 --> 00:57:04,892
-[gunshot]
-Oh, fuck.

884
00:57:27,648 --> 00:57:28,950
When was the last time
you slept?

885
00:57:29,984 --> 00:57:31,719
I caught an hour
in the break room.

886
00:57:32,653 --> 00:57:34,855
We get any word from Knight?

887
00:57:34,889 --> 00:57:37,224
He's probably halfway
to Argentina by now.

888
00:57:38,092 --> 00:57:40,695
Nah, he wouldn't run
from a fight.

889
00:57:40,728 --> 00:57:42,263
Nah, you wanna think
the worst of him,

890
00:57:42,296 --> 00:57:45,733
but he'll be there
when the time comes.
No.

891
00:57:45,766 --> 00:57:47,935
You know, just because you
don't want something to happen

892
00:57:47,969 --> 00:57:49,737
doesn't mean it won't.

893
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:51,872
I'm a single mother, Fitz.

894
00:57:51,906 --> 00:57:54,842
I'm well aware of making plans
and having God interfere.

895
00:57:56,911 --> 00:57:59,046
Seeing as how
you're already pissed off

896
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,782
and messing around
in my city without authority...

897
00:58:06,854 --> 00:58:08,255
What?

898
00:58:08,289 --> 00:58:09,557
Casey Rhodes.

899
00:58:10,024 --> 00:58:11,125
What about him?

900
00:58:12,126 --> 00:58:15,029
He busted out with Conlan
during the jailbreak.

901
00:58:15,062 --> 00:58:17,231
Called his wife.
She cut a deal with us.

902
00:58:17,264 --> 00:58:20,301
You cut a deal with the man who
put me in this fucking chair?

903
00:58:20,334 --> 00:58:22,903
I want my city to be safe.

904
00:58:22,937 --> 00:58:24,939
It's a means to an end.

905
00:58:27,108 --> 00:58:28,743
You find anything on Conlan?

906
00:58:31,212 --> 00:58:34,315
[sighs] The guy's talking
like he's about to pull off

907
00:58:34,348 --> 00:58:36,684
the biggest heist in history.

908
00:58:37,752 --> 00:58:41,856
Look, I've been doing some
research on potential targets.

909
00:58:41,889 --> 00:58:45,960
Okay? And right now, the record
is the Cali truck job in '97.

910
00:58:45,993 --> 00:58:47,795
The take was over 30 mil.

911
00:58:48,629 --> 00:58:49,830
Mm-mmm.

912
00:58:49,864 --> 00:58:52,666
Biggest heist was in '75.

913
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,935
Eight guys hit a secret bank
owned by the mob.

914
00:58:56,103 --> 00:58:58,205
A secret bank?

915
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:01,742
Conlan may be crazy,
but he knows better than
to mess with the families.

916
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:05,913
[softly] Yeah.
Look, get some rest.

917
00:59:07,948 --> 00:59:09,650
Knight will be back
at some point.

918
00:59:10,918 --> 00:59:11,952
Yeah.

919
00:59:18,759 --> 00:59:21,262
[scoffs]
Speak of the devil.

920
00:59:36,877 --> 00:59:39,213
They wanna put me on desk duty.
Can you believe that?

921
00:59:39,246 --> 00:59:42,183
Probably for the best.
Excuse me?

922
00:59:42,216 --> 00:59:44,985
Why, do you think if a guy
runs up a flight of stairs,

923
00:59:45,019 --> 00:59:46,120
I can't catch him?

924
00:59:47,154 --> 00:59:50,191
[chuckles] Oh, you're just
full of Christmas spirit,

925
00:59:50,224 --> 00:59:51,325
aren't you, huh?

926
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:52,893
You old bastard.

927
00:59:54,395 --> 00:59:56,397
See, the games have changed,
my brother.

928
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:59,700
There's no more rules.
There's no more codes.

929
01:00:00,334 --> 01:00:02,203
The game has changed.

930
01:00:02,236 --> 01:00:05,106
Yeah, Conlan isn't human.

931
01:00:07,007 --> 01:00:08,976
Look, the captain spoke
to the mayor.

932
01:00:09,009 --> 01:00:10,411
I spoke to the mayor.

933
01:00:10,444 --> 01:00:14,215
He-- He had this itinerary
on his desk.

934
01:00:14,248 --> 01:00:17,251
Some kind of meeting set up at,
I don't know,

935
01:00:17,284 --> 01:00:19,386
Wooddrake Antiques
or something.

936
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:21,088
Can you believe that shit?

937
01:00:21,122 --> 01:00:23,858
That guy is out shopping
while his city is under siege

938
01:00:23,891 --> 01:00:25,126
from a madman.

939
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,429
You wanna hear
something else crazy?

940
01:00:28,462 --> 01:00:31,031
Rhodes is cutting a deal
with the captain.

941
01:00:31,065 --> 01:00:32,700
And the DA is gonna go for it.

942
01:00:34,235 --> 01:00:36,203
Desperate times.

943
01:00:36,237 --> 01:00:38,139
Christ, if I get
my fucking hands on Rhodes,

944
01:00:38,172 --> 01:00:40,641
I'm gonna put my gun up his
ass, pull the trigger.

945
01:00:44,411 --> 01:00:45,779
Jesus Christ.

946
01:00:46,714 --> 01:00:49,083
You can't stop thinking
about him, can you?

947
01:00:49,116 --> 01:00:52,086
Just forget about this
and come back to LA.

948
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:55,022
They have zero physical evidence
to lock you up.

949
01:00:55,055 --> 01:00:56,423
Your daughter misses you.

950
01:00:56,457 --> 01:00:58,726
Christ, I miss you.

951
01:00:58,759 --> 01:01:02,329
Do you know how much shit
Macey is giving me
for even being here?

952
01:01:03,464 --> 01:01:07,835
I'll be lucky if I'm not
divorced before New Year's.

953
01:01:10,404 --> 01:01:12,740
I am who I am.

954
01:01:12,773 --> 01:01:15,476
Okay, fine. You know what?
Don't listen to me.

955
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:18,245
But Conlan isn't like
any other criminal.

956
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,383
Don't let Conlan get
to you like Winna.

957
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:23,984
You'll never come back.

958
01:01:24,952 --> 01:01:25,986
Well, you're wrong.

959
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:27,888
No, I'm your friend.

960
01:01:27,922 --> 01:01:31,425
You've saved my life more times
than I've had hot meals,

961
01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:35,329
and I feel like it's time
for me to repay the debt.

962
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:40,067
Well, if Conlan kills me,
then so be it.

963
01:01:41,168 --> 01:01:42,203
Knight, I...

964
01:01:47,542 --> 01:01:48,943
And you know what?

965
01:01:48,976 --> 01:01:51,812
Fuck you for making me
all sentimental.

966
01:01:53,781 --> 01:01:54,815
Just come home.

967
01:01:56,217 --> 01:01:58,219
Don't-- Don't turn
into a monster

968
01:01:58,252 --> 01:02:00,120
by chasing a monster.

969
01:02:00,154 --> 01:02:01,855
Okay? That's all I ask.

970
01:02:11,198 --> 01:02:13,400
Just say grace
and I'll be there soon.

971
01:02:15,336 --> 01:02:16,737
Don't be so dramatic.

972
01:02:17,606 --> 01:02:19,873
The kids aren't gonna care
that I missed dinner

973
01:02:19,907 --> 01:02:22,109
when they see the presents
I got them.

974
01:02:22,142 --> 01:02:23,444
[voices chanting] <i>Ho.</i>
Okay.

975
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,754
Jerome, drive.

976
01:02:41,428 --> 01:02:42,963
Oh, shit.

977
01:02:42,997 --> 01:02:44,566
Conlan said I would be spared.

978
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:47,368
-He looked me right in the eye--
-Really?

979
01:02:47,401 --> 01:02:49,203
'Cause he told me
to eat the rich.

980
01:02:50,538 --> 01:02:52,306
Wondering if he was
meaning that literally.

981
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:56,143
I told Conlan where every bank
in this city

982
01:02:56,176 --> 01:02:58,479
was consolidating its valuables.

983
01:02:58,513 --> 01:03:00,314
We made a deal.
Mmm.

984
01:03:01,882 --> 01:03:03,484
Well, he sent me to renegotiate.

985
01:03:07,354 --> 01:03:09,189
Have you seen my son?
Where's my son?

986
01:03:10,891 --> 01:03:11,925
Have you seen...

987
01:03:15,429 --> 01:03:17,298
[engine starts]

988
01:03:25,306 --> 01:03:26,907
[store bell dings]

989
01:03:48,896 --> 01:03:50,264
Boy, get your ass over here.

990
01:03:50,297 --> 01:03:52,099
Gonna miss my TED Talk.

991
01:03:55,369 --> 01:03:58,038
Now, I know Conlan is
a mad son of a bitch.

992
01:03:59,173 --> 01:04:00,575
But all the great ones are.

993
01:04:02,009 --> 01:04:04,078
That man has
shown me the truth.

994
01:04:04,111 --> 01:04:07,549
Every one of us has been
abused, used by the system.

995
01:04:07,582 --> 01:04:10,618
They have taken our time,
our life.

996
01:04:10,652 --> 01:04:13,153
They have put us in cages
for crimes that the 1%

997
01:04:13,187 --> 01:04:14,355
commit every day.

998
01:04:16,156 --> 01:04:19,159
This city belongs to us.

999
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:23,397
It is ours.
And it always has been ours!

1000
01:04:24,331 --> 01:04:27,167
And now it's time to make
everybody see the light.

1001
01:04:31,673 --> 01:04:33,608
[Conlan] The plan is simple.

1002
01:04:33,641 --> 01:04:38,445
Thanks to our new brother here,
the mayor will let us in.

1003
01:04:38,479 --> 01:04:40,515
And we'll take it from there.

1004
01:04:40,548 --> 01:04:43,984
No prisoners, no survivors.

1005
01:04:45,352 --> 01:04:47,087
Some of you won't make it out.

1006
01:04:48,455 --> 01:04:50,090
But upon your fallen bodies,

1007
01:04:50,124 --> 01:04:52,459
we will build the foundation
of this great movement.

1008
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:56,997
One day, many years from now
when you're old,

1009
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:58,198
lying in your deathbed,

1010
01:04:58,232 --> 01:05:00,602
you'll look up
at your loved ones

1011
01:05:00,635 --> 01:05:02,537
and one moment

1012
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:04,506
will flash before your memory.

1013
01:05:05,406 --> 01:05:07,307
This day.

1014
01:05:07,341 --> 01:05:09,143
This moment of greatness.

1015
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:14,148
You're my brothers,
and I'm proud of you.

1016
01:05:15,717 --> 01:05:17,117
Hey.

1017
01:05:18,252 --> 01:05:21,088
You came to me, remember?

1018
01:05:21,121 --> 01:05:22,624
You said your father
held you down.

1019
01:05:22,657 --> 01:05:23,957
He put his foot on you

1020
01:05:23,991 --> 01:05:25,459
and pushed you to the ground,

1021
01:05:25,492 --> 01:05:27,294
so he could rise up.

1022
01:05:27,327 --> 01:05:29,129
And now what?

1023
01:05:29,163 --> 01:05:32,466
Now you're alone?
No, you're one of us.

1024
01:05:32,499 --> 01:05:36,170
You're part of our family.
You're in a real family now.

1025
01:05:36,203 --> 01:05:38,138
I'm proud of you.

1026
01:05:38,172 --> 01:05:40,040
You made the right choice.

1027
01:05:40,073 --> 01:05:43,076
'Cause we will always
be there for you.

1028
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:48,015
Treat him the way you
treat each other.

1029
01:05:48,048 --> 01:05:49,249
He's one of us now.

1030
01:06:01,295 --> 01:06:02,329
You got this.

1031
01:06:12,707 --> 01:06:14,241
You're with us now.

1032
01:06:14,274 --> 01:06:17,244
And you will do exactly
as we say.

1033
01:06:17,277 --> 01:06:19,413
You speak when I tell you.

1034
01:06:19,446 --> 01:06:21,549
You jump when I tell you.

1035
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:24,151
You shoot when I tell you.

1036
01:06:25,285 --> 01:06:28,088
Now get dressed, bitch.

01:17:57,878 --> 01:17:59,747
I'm no thief.

1221
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:02,983
I'm just a man who played
the system that made me.

1222
01:18:03,017 --> 01:18:04,451
Shit.

1223
01:18:04,485 --> 01:18:06,954
Part of you believes
in this mission.

1224
01:18:07,721 --> 01:18:10,357
I can see it in your eyes
right there.

1225
01:18:11,992 --> 01:18:13,127
Look at this.

1226
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,196
Look at these riches.

1227
01:18:15,229 --> 01:18:17,331
We can overthrow
governments with this.

1228
01:18:18,165 --> 01:18:21,936
We can bring about
the great liberation.

1229
01:18:21,969 --> 01:18:25,406
This is the beginning
of the unbreaking of humanity.

1230
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:27,875
My father taught me
to fix what's broken.

1231
01:18:29,276 --> 01:18:31,912
Your father was a cuck.

1232
01:18:31,946 --> 01:18:34,348
With the deep state's balls...

1233
01:18:34,381 --> 01:18:36,250
[clicking tongue]

1234
01:18:36,283 --> 01:18:37,484
...tickling his tonsils.

1235
01:18:37,519 --> 01:18:39,386
[laughing]

1236
01:18:40,487 --> 01:18:43,424
My father taught me that
if you can't change the world,

1237
01:18:45,092 --> 01:18:46,227
bring it to its knees.

1238
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:51,832
We are so close.

1239
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:54,235
So close.

1240
01:18:55,469 --> 01:18:56,904
Don't you understand?

1241
01:18:59,106 --> 01:19:02,776
They killed my son
with their fake wars.

1242
01:19:04,445 --> 01:19:07,147
I will end them before
they do that to your child.

1243
01:19:08,916 --> 01:19:10,317
I'm doing this for you.

1244
01:19:11,252 --> 01:19:13,354
Help me, I beg you.

1245
01:19:14,855 --> 01:19:16,423
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1246
01:19:16,457 --> 01:19:18,158
Listen to me.

1247
01:19:18,192 --> 01:19:19,927
Christmas is about togetherness.

1248
01:19:20,562 --> 01:19:21,795
I need you.

1249
01:19:22,796 --> 01:19:25,032
I need you to help these men
bring out that loot.

1250
01:19:25,933 --> 01:19:29,370
Do that, and I swear
on the baby in the manger,

1251
01:19:29,403 --> 01:19:30,871
I will let your family go.

1252
01:19:40,981 --> 01:19:43,117
We're out of here
in four minutes, Santas.

1253
01:19:47,054 --> 01:19:48,188
You did good.

1254
01:19:59,066 --> 01:20:01,101
[sirens wailing in distance]

1255
01:20:12,514 --> 01:20:15,149
Stupid-ass elites think
they can hide their pearls

1256
01:20:15,182 --> 01:20:16,483
in a closed-down bank.

1257
01:20:18,385 --> 01:20:21,955
Yeah, this shit got to be
at least nine figures
once it's fenced.

1258
01:20:21,989 --> 01:20:24,358
Money is just a way
of keeping score.

1259
01:20:24,391 --> 01:20:27,227
We'll redistribute the wealth
of the world.

1260
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:31,365
We did it, Dajon. [laughs]

1261
01:20:33,267 --> 01:20:34,268
Okay, I'm done.

1262
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:37,471
You're done
when I say you're done.
No, no, no, no.

1263
01:20:37,505 --> 01:20:39,541
I helped you get your little
fucking war chest thing, okay--

1264
01:20:39,574 --> 01:20:41,909
This is not a negotiation.
I'm fucking done.

1265
01:20:41,942 --> 01:20:43,645
Get your fucking hands
off me.

1266
01:20:43,678 --> 01:20:44,945
I have your wife.

1267
01:20:45,913 --> 01:20:47,014
I have your daughter.

1268
01:20:49,016 --> 01:20:50,351
You're one of us now.

1269
01:20:50,384 --> 01:20:51,452
Act like it.

1270
01:21:09,637 --> 01:21:11,305
Hey! Who are you?

1271
01:21:11,338 --> 01:21:13,641
What the-- Oh, fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1272
01:21:13,675 --> 01:21:15,376
What the fuck is that?
Is that a grenade?

1273
01:21:15,409 --> 01:21:17,378
Fuck, fuck, fuck! Where
did it go? Where did it go?

1274
01:21:33,528 --> 01:21:35,062
[grunts]

1275
01:21:48,375 --> 01:21:50,144
Hurry the fuck up. He's here.

1276
01:21:54,415 --> 01:21:56,116
Come on, go! Come on, go!

1277
01:22:11,999 --> 01:22:14,034
[gunfire in distance]

1278
01:22:19,373 --> 01:22:20,642
The fuck is all that?

1279
01:22:20,675 --> 01:22:22,577
[gunfire continues]

1280
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:24,178
Fuck is all that?

1281
01:22:24,211 --> 01:22:25,713
You tip 'em off?

1282
01:22:25,747 --> 01:22:26,980
He's here.

1283
01:22:29,684 --> 01:22:32,286
Where are you hiding, Detective?

1284
01:22:32,319 --> 01:22:33,655
I can smell you.

1285
01:22:37,024 --> 01:22:38,593
Fear everywhere, buddy.

1286
01:22:38,626 --> 01:22:42,062
You handsome bald devil,
come out and play.

1287
01:22:42,095 --> 01:22:43,497
[Knight] Ho, ho, ho.

1288
01:22:49,303 --> 01:22:53,373
[laughs] Hello, Detective.

1289
01:22:54,475 --> 01:22:56,778
Nothing better to do
on Christmas Eve?

1290
01:22:56,811 --> 01:22:59,246
This is as good
as it gets for me.

1291
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:02,082
Well, with friends like us,
who needs family?

1292
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:04,051
[Rhodes groans]

1293
01:23:05,185 --> 01:23:06,253
Am I right?

1294
01:23:11,291 --> 01:23:12,426
This is how it's gonna go.

1295
01:23:12,459 --> 01:23:14,061
I'll tell you how.

1296
01:23:14,094 --> 01:23:17,097
I'm gonna shove a Christmas tree
up your ass...

1297
01:23:18,098 --> 01:23:19,634
[chuckles]
...and set it on fire.

1298
01:23:19,667 --> 01:23:21,769
A Christmas tree up my ass?

1299
01:23:21,803 --> 01:23:23,470
All the way.

1300
01:23:23,505 --> 01:23:25,372
Okay, okay.

1301
01:23:25,405 --> 01:23:27,307
You're even kinkier
than I thought, Detective.

1302
01:23:27,341 --> 01:23:28,375
But I like that.

1303
01:23:29,209 --> 01:23:30,277
No foreplay, okay?

1304
01:23:31,513 --> 01:23:35,282
You're gonna make sure
we walk out of here
free and clear.

1305
01:23:35,315 --> 01:23:37,719
[Knight] Why? Because you have
a gun to his head?

1306
01:23:38,686 --> 01:23:40,187
The fuck do I care?

1307
01:23:41,121 --> 01:23:42,222
Shoot him.

1308
01:23:43,156 --> 01:23:44,291
What?

1309
01:23:44,324 --> 01:23:46,026
You shot my partner.

1310
01:23:49,296 --> 01:23:51,098
See what I'm dealing with here?

1311
01:23:51,131 --> 01:23:53,300
He sold you up the river,
Rhodes.

1312
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:54,802
You mean nothing to him.

1313
01:23:54,836 --> 01:23:56,370
Less than nothing.

1314
01:23:57,471 --> 01:23:59,139
Less than nothing. Wow.

1315
01:23:59,172 --> 01:24:00,474
You're cold, Detective.

1316
01:24:02,175 --> 01:24:03,210
Wow.

1317
01:24:05,713 --> 01:24:09,449
Dajon, you forgot to
get me a Christmas present.

1318
01:24:10,585 --> 01:24:14,221
I would like this motherfucker's
head in my stocking, please.

1319
01:24:15,155 --> 01:24:17,090
[grunting]
[Conlan] Would someone
just kill him?

1320
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:21,696
Where is your Christmas spirit,
Detective Knight?

1321
01:24:24,732 --> 01:24:26,166
[grunting]

1322
01:24:30,605 --> 01:24:32,574
Dajon, quit fucking around.

1323
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:35,342
You let that pretty boy
kick your ass?

1324
01:24:39,881 --> 01:24:42,416
I trained you better than that,
you little pussy.

1325
01:24:44,519 --> 01:24:46,219
[both grunting]

1326
01:24:47,354 --> 01:24:48,723
[henchman] I'm coming, boss!

1327
01:24:52,326 --> 01:24:54,227
[grunting, groaning]

1328
01:24:57,230 --> 01:24:58,833
-[gun clicks]
-[Knight] Fuck.

1329
01:24:59,701 --> 01:25:01,201
[Conlan] Uh-oh.

1330
01:25:02,837 --> 01:25:05,372
[grunting, groaning]

1331
01:25:07,642 --> 01:25:10,210
Sounds like Santa Claus didn't
give you enough ammunition

1332
01:25:10,243 --> 01:25:11,579
for this party.

1333
01:25:13,313 --> 01:25:15,148
Don't you worry.

1334
01:25:15,182 --> 01:25:17,250
Father Conlan has
more than enough bullets

1335
01:25:17,284 --> 01:25:18,318
to share with you.

1336
01:25:19,186 --> 01:25:20,454
[laughs]

1337
01:25:23,958 --> 01:25:25,492
You were right again, Knight.

1338
01:25:26,226 --> 01:25:27,795
This only ends
with one of us dead.

1339
01:25:30,932 --> 01:25:32,700
Merry Christmas, motherfucker.

1340
01:25:33,668 --> 01:25:35,435
[grunts]

1341
01:25:35,870 --> 01:25:38,539
[panting]

1342
01:25:42,744 --> 01:25:45,412
[groaning]

1343
01:25:51,351 --> 01:25:52,854
How you doing, brother?

1344
01:25:52,887 --> 01:25:54,622
[grunting, groaning]

1345
01:26:02,997 --> 01:26:05,533
You f-- Oh.

1346
01:26:09,269 --> 01:26:10,337
[Conlan] Wow.

1347
01:26:11,806 --> 01:26:13,808
Didn't see that coming.

1348
01:26:13,841 --> 01:26:15,610
[laughs]

1349
01:26:32,492 --> 01:26:33,594
Are we good?

1350
01:26:33,628 --> 01:26:35,563
I mean, not, you know,
good good.

1351
01:26:35,596 --> 01:26:38,566
But good enough?

1352
01:26:38,599 --> 01:26:42,302
I'm gonna give you five seconds
before I lube up my gun.

1353
01:26:43,270 --> 01:26:44,639
What the fuck does that mean?

1354
01:26:44,672 --> 01:26:46,708
Well, I guess you're gonna
find out in four.

1355
01:26:47,542 --> 01:26:48,843
One.

1356
01:26:49,711 --> 01:26:50,812
Two.

1357
01:26:51,713 --> 01:26:52,747
Three.

1358
01:27:04,058 --> 01:27:05,626
[crying] It's gonna be okay.

1359
01:27:07,061 --> 01:27:08,629
[sirens wailing]

1360
01:27:10,363 --> 01:27:11,498
Mom!

1361
01:27:17,839 --> 01:27:20,273
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1362
01:27:24,612 --> 01:27:28,816
[chuckling] It's gonna
be okay. It's okay.

1363
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:30,885
[sobbing] Thank you so much.
Thank you.

1364
01:27:30,918 --> 01:27:32,452
Thank you, thank you.

1365
01:27:32,486 --> 01:27:33,821
[Vassetti] Arthur!

1366
01:27:34,789 --> 01:27:36,557
Arthur, where are you?

1367
01:27:36,591 --> 01:27:38,793
[police officer] Freeze! NYPD!

1368
01:27:38,826 --> 01:27:40,962
Put it down! Hands
where we can see them.

1369
01:27:40,995 --> 01:27:42,329
I'm looking for my son.

1370
01:27:43,097 --> 01:27:44,464
Arthur Vassetti.

1371
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,935
Please, help me find my son.

1372
01:27:51,639 --> 01:27:52,673
Where is my son?

1373
01:27:53,473 --> 01:27:55,475
My son's name
is Arthur Vassetti.

1374
01:27:56,577 --> 01:27:58,880
Ricky Conlan took my son!

1375
01:27:58,913 --> 01:28:02,382
[reporter] Did Conlan meet
your son at church?
Where's my son, Arthur?

1376
01:28:02,415 --> 01:28:04,619
[reporter] How long were
you working for Conlan?

1377
01:28:04,652 --> 01:28:07,420
[crowd chanting] Lock him up!
Lock him up!

1378
01:28:07,454 --> 01:28:09,422
Ricky Conlan has my son.

1379
01:28:10,725 --> 01:28:12,026
Find my son!

1380
01:28:20,568 --> 01:28:21,936
[no audible dialogue]

1381
01:28:49,096 --> 01:28:51,364
You're the gift that keeps
on giving.

1382
01:28:56,637 --> 01:28:57,672
You win.

1383
01:28:58,906 --> 01:29:00,675
[laughing]

1384
01:29:03,978 --> 01:29:06,413
Don't let them put me in a cage.

1385
01:29:08,448 --> 01:29:09,917
I'm not going back.

1386
01:29:11,619 --> 01:29:12,687
Kill me.

1387
01:29:13,554 --> 01:29:15,690
[panting] Do it.

1388
01:29:27,134 --> 01:29:28,936
Merry Christmas, motherfucker.

1389
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:30,437
[voices chant] <i>Ho!</i>

[court official]
The State calls to the stand
Detective Fitzgerald.

1391
01:31:34,095 --> 01:31:36,664
[Mason] Good to see you
on your feet again, Fitz.

1392
01:31:36,697 --> 01:31:39,133
Anything to make you happy,
Mason.

1393
01:31:39,166 --> 01:31:40,835
How about you save us all
a bunch of time

1394
01:31:40,868 --> 01:31:42,770
and tell us the real truth
about your partner?

1395
01:31:44,038 --> 01:31:45,740
Oh, where do I begin?

1396
01:31:45,773 --> 01:31:47,541
Knight was cleared
for the extraordinary events

1397
01:31:47,575 --> 01:31:49,677
in New York City
and the prosecutor lacks

1398
01:31:49,710 --> 01:31:51,746
the evidence he needs
to charge him for the murder

1399
01:31:51,779 --> 01:31:54,181
of one Jerry Leach
which, ipso facto,

1400
01:31:54,215 --> 01:31:56,317
does not make that guy innocent.

1401
01:31:56,350 --> 01:31:57,852
[Fitzgerald] Ipso facto?

1402
01:31:57,885 --> 01:31:59,253
Who gives a fuck?

1403
01:32:00,021 --> 01:32:02,890
No one's crying for Jerry Leach.

1404
01:32:02,923 --> 01:32:06,761
The man was a convicted murderer
who got off on a technicality.

1405
01:32:07,695 --> 01:32:09,130
If Knight killed him,

1406
01:32:09,163 --> 01:32:12,066
it was only to stop him
before he hurt someone else.

1407
01:32:12,099 --> 01:32:14,802
Detective,
is the world a safer place

1408
01:32:14,835 --> 01:32:16,904
with Knight behind bars
or behind a badge?

1409
01:32:16,937 --> 01:32:19,907
Honestly, where do I begin?

1410
01:32:21,308 --> 01:32:25,579
He's moody, disorganized,
he drives fast,

1411
01:32:25,613 --> 01:32:26,847
talks shit all day.

1412
01:32:26,881 --> 01:32:28,349
He's a workaholic.

1413
01:32:28,382 --> 01:32:30,985
I once caught him teaching
my eldest son

1414
01:32:31,018 --> 01:32:33,788
to do e-brake turns
in a parking lot.

1415
01:32:33,821 --> 01:32:37,224
Okay, my son Sam is nine.
Nine years old.

1416
01:32:37,258 --> 01:32:40,995
And he didn't think that
he was doing anything wrong.

1417
01:32:41,028 --> 01:32:44,799
He has yet to pick up a check,
not once in the eight years

1418
01:32:44,832 --> 01:32:46,734
that we've been partners.

1419
01:32:46,767 --> 01:32:50,871
Let's just say
this guy is an asshole.

1420
01:32:51,972 --> 01:32:53,841
But it's not his job
to be liked.

1421
01:32:54,909 --> 01:32:58,312
This man has more experience
than the rest of the guys

1422
01:32:58,345 --> 01:33:00,881
in the department combined.

1423
01:33:00,915 --> 01:33:04,151
He's the first man on the
scene. He's the first man
through the door.

1424
01:33:04,185 --> 01:33:06,654
This guy is a cop.

1425
01:33:09,123 --> 01:33:10,658
And we are all much safer

1426
01:33:11,792 --> 01:33:13,694
with James Knight
behind the badge.

1427
01:33:15,029 --> 01:33:17,631
[department representative]
<i>After hearing</i>
<i>two dozen testimonies</i>

1428
01:33:17,665 --> 01:33:19,633
<i>assessing victim</i>
<i>impact statements</i>

1429
01:33:19,667 --> 01:33:22,736
<i>and his past cases,</i>
<i>the department recommends that</i>

1430
01:33:22,770 --> 01:33:26,040
<i>James Knight be reinstated</i>
<i>effective immediately.</i>

1431
01:33:27,041 --> 01:33:28,943
<i>Congratulations, Detective.</i>
