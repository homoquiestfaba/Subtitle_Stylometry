1
00:02:45,268 --> 00:02:48,790
- Hey bro?
- So "compadre".

2
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:52,066
- Damn.
- You're okay?

3
00:02:52,195 --> 00:02:54,678
Yeah! I'm fine. I just want to
get my paycheck get out of here.

4
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:55,678
You broke again?

5
00:02:55,793 --> 00:03:00,996
I laid out a little bit of money last night
No big deal, today is pay day.

6
00:03:01,111 --> 00:03:07,290
- And what's her name?
- Gwnie Diamonds. She didn't show.

7
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:15,175
<i>Hey, would you look at that?
One day I'm gonna have me one of those.</i>

8
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:19,415
Yeah, you thinking of leaving
the docks and becoming a driver?

9
00:03:19,903 --> 00:03:24,388
<i>I'm gonna leave the docks all right
I ain't gonna be no limo driver.</i>

10
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:30,606
One day would be a
very rich man.

11
00:03:32,776 --> 00:03:35,626
You're saying since New Orleans, man.

12
00:03:35,838 --> 00:03:37,613
I hope your dreams come true, Nick.

13
00:03:37,813 --> 00:03:40,006
I could show you that
20 bucks you owe me.

14
00:03:40,206 --> 00:03:43,823
Yeah, we're speaking of money.
I'm gonna get the paycheck.

15
00:03:47,251 --> 00:03:49,854
Look that guy.
Get him out of here now

16
00:03:53,586 --> 00:03:55,010
Hey where do you think you're going?

17
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,385
I want to talk to the foreman.
He's got my paycheck.

18
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:00,669
- It can wait. Get out of here.
- What wrong with you?

19
00:04:00,784 --> 00:04:03,305
Beat it! Or I'll rip your head off

20
00:04:03,505 --> 00:04:06,396
and bouncing around
like a basketball.

21
00:04:41,508 --> 00:04:44,655
What hell is going on here?
I say we run fo it.

22
00:04:44,855 --> 00:04:46,612
I say good.

23
00:05:07,113 --> 00:05:09,087
Mr. Han.

24
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:15,012
Mr. Landis, we finally meet.
I am impressed by your accomplishments.

25
00:05:15,212 --> 00:05:17,218
- Take a sit.
- No, thank you.

26
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:21,598
Very soon my organization will
be the most powerful in Asia.

27
00:05:21,713 --> 00:05:25,736
With the British being ousted in 1997.
We need to expand.

28
00:05:25,851 --> 00:05:30,290
There's too much competition.
Chicanos, Italians, Iranians.

29
00:05:30,405 --> 00:05:34,138
- We need weapons, the best.
- You have the best.

30
00:05:34,253 --> 00:05:37,598
Fortunately weapons
alone will not be enough.

31
00:05:37,786 --> 00:05:41,541
It is the finger behind the
trigger which must be loyal.

32
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:03,333
A very powerful weapon.

33
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:06,834
A great journey begins with one step.

34
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:10,118
Would you like to do some
business, Mr. Landis?

35
00:06:10,284 --> 00:06:14,122
- What would you have me do?
- Can you stand against that wall?

36
00:06:14,473 --> 00:06:18,868
I'm afraid my accomplishments
well exceed your childishness.

37
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:24,527
I like you, Mr. Landis.
Seems we all have our limitations.

38
00:06:24,642 --> 00:06:29,640
But what about my competition.
you know this James Fratelli?

39
00:06:29,777 --> 00:06:32,316
- Fratello.
- That's him, yes.

40
00:06:32,431 --> 00:06:36,010
- What do you want from him?
- I don't want anything from him.

41
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,050
I want something from you.

42
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,803
I want you to eliminate
Jimmie Fratello e Lopez.

43
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:47,676
<i>This guy starts yelling
since I'm trying to break</i>

44
00:06:47,876 --> 00:06:50,253
<i>his finger big deal is
trying to break his arm.</i>

45
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:53,345
I bet that was the last pesky
trying to steal from you.

46
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:56,800
Nope. Believe it or not same
guy diferent finger 7th degree.

47
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:02,039
You know we really shouldn't be
laughing, we're out work again.

48
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:06,404
Yeah I know but after what
I saw those boxes, who cares?

49
00:07:06,604 --> 00:07:08,767
Yeah I saw those.
Those were Mac-10s.

50
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:12,221
What kind of guys that use those
are like drug runners and assassins.

51
00:07:12,421 --> 00:07:13,421
Whole bunch other guys
you don't want to meet.

52
00:07:13,773 --> 00:07:15,827
I'll drink to that.

53
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:20,871
Seriously Nick, that's a third
job we've lost hasn't been in LA.

54
00:07:21,071 --> 00:07:23,369
That's all lousy stinking jobs anyway.

55
00:07:24,263 --> 00:07:27,309
I gotta tell you man, it up
to here with LA already.

56
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:31,043
How can you say that. I mean LA
is the land of opportunity.

57
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:37,085
In the night I'm at the gym.
I meet this guy his name's uh... Landis.

58
00:07:37,203 --> 00:07:40,541
Anyway this guy pays big
money for full-contact fighters.

59
00:07:40,741 --> 00:07:41,789
Big money, huh?

60
00:07:41,989 --> 00:07:44,635
Big money. See this guy Lance
he sets up the fights underground.

61
00:07:44,835 --> 00:07:46,561
You win the fight you win the cash.

62
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:48,757
No taxes, no nothing.

63
00:07:48,957 --> 00:07:52,130
No feeling from the neck down if
you mess with the wrong guy, Nick?

64
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,513
You're always looking for an easy buck.
Haven't you learned there's no such thing?

65
00:07:56,713 --> 00:07:59,409
It's called paying your dues, "compadre".

66
00:08:00,873 --> 00:08:06,462
You're crazy. You could get
hurt you could get killed.

67
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:10,806
Yeah, well uh! I can take care of myself
and so can you so let's give it a shot.

68
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:12,604
I don't think so.

69
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:17,375
You don't get it, do you?
I've had enough.

70
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,039
Man, I hear they're
hiring up north pays good.

71
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:24,892
I'm thinking a heading up that way.

72
00:08:25,148 --> 00:08:28,965
Maybe I'll do it right this time save
some money. Go back to school.

73
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:33,401
Well, looks like I go it alone.

74
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:40,118
We've been through a lot together. I mean
New York, Galliston you've been here in LA.

75
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:45,234
- You go for it you.
- Watch your ass.

76
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:49,010
<i>Hey, what's gonna bail me out?</i>

77
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:53,059
Why, should things change
call me if you need me.

78
00:09:04,014 --> 00:09:07,864
He'll be back.
I'm owe 20 bucks.

79
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:21,923
- Doing something?
- No.

80
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:47,111
Open this valise.

81
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:01,600
That's Puccini.

82
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,743
my grandfather loved Puccini.

83
00:10:03,943 --> 00:10:07,036
It was my mother's father
pretty Tommy O'Brien.

84
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:11,798
We got the name cuz he looked like an
Irish but he wasn't it was Italian.

85
00:10:11,998 --> 00:10:13,819
Through and through the family
came from northern Italy.

86
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:16,502
But he didn't look at it.

87
00:10:16,702 --> 00:10:20,390
You know he had this sandy, sandy
blonde and it's intense green eyes.

88
00:10:20,505 --> 00:10:22,801
Pretty Tommy O'Brien he got the nickname

89
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:25,583
because he was a
good-looking son of the gun.

90
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:28,180
He really was they dressed
dressed to the night.

91
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,751
You know and except it
was a tiny little guy.

92
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:36,208
With a vicious temper and you never
wonder cross pretty Tommy O'Brien.

93
00:10:36,323 --> 00:10:38,895
It was mean he had a mean side.

94
00:10:39,074 --> 00:10:41,982
Well you know not only would he
whacked out but he cut your head off,

95
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:45,878
with this machete in amusing
this, this private machete of his.

96
00:10:47,068 --> 00:10:50,265
And have you stole from him you're
not down on he wouldn't even

97
00:10:50,465 --> 00:10:54,024
give you the decency to killing a
guy dead awful you're still alive.

98
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:57,428
There was a guy in the neighborhood used
to knock down right he knew about it.

99
00:10:57,628 --> 00:11:00,786
For quite a while so this goombas joking
I'm right he's wait he's waiting.

100
00:11:00,912 --> 00:11:03,160
One night he invites him
over for dinner you say

101
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,512
a couple lieutenants grab the guy two story.

102
00:11:05,676 --> 00:11:07,862
Dragged him down on the basement
to hold him down on the floor and

103
00:11:08,062 --> 00:11:13,250
Tommy O'Brien looks right the guy's face
he tells him laughing right in his face.

104
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,222
Stealing from me ain't
nothing lose your head over.

105
00:11:16,422 --> 00:11:19,826
And proceeds to decapitate the
guy right there in the basement.

106
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:23,119
The guy was screaming for his mother.
There was blood every place.

107
00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:30,079
That's was my grandfather yeah.
He was brutal but very effective.

108
00:11:31,805 --> 00:11:36,449
- You got five minutes of my time, Vanik.
- Solely.

109
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:47,215
What I thought you guys went to the fight
since when you stopped playing with guns.

110
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,994
You can have as many as you want.

111
00:11:49,194 --> 00:11:51,553
M-16's, Stinger missiles.
You name it.

112
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:57,510
Why are you coming to me with this?
I got plenty of weapons.

113
00:11:57,647 --> 00:12:00,232
This little war it's
burning between you and the

114
00:12:00,432 --> 00:12:03,457
Iron Tigers we just want to
be on this side that wins.

115
00:12:03,743 --> 00:12:09,046
Maybe one day we need your help.
Maybe we can help you right now.

116
00:12:09,418 --> 00:12:15,395
Why how wide of you. And what does
that help going to we're gonna cost me.

117
00:12:15,741 --> 00:12:21,911
Not much. You buy the hot way from us
and we get 25% of the operation.

118
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:49,539
This Landis is little strange.
But is he also crazy?

119
00:12:49,947 --> 00:12:52,246
Why would I do something like that?

120
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:54,755
Because gonna put you over the top.

121
00:12:54,955 --> 00:12:57,310
Unless the Tigers
it's gonna get him first.

122
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,356
<i>Think about, Jimmie.</i>

123
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:04,457
Thank you again,
for your time.

124
00:13:15,548 --> 00:13:17,479
Frankie.

125
00:13:22,504 --> 00:13:24,340
Yeah boss?

126
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:30,103
Follow that muscle-bound loader to
find out whether stash of these things.

127
00:13:33,306 --> 00:13:36,470
And whack their head.

128
00:13:42,135 --> 00:13:45,720
I think Jimmie's gonna get a bang others.

129
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:49,135
Just like the fourth of July.

130
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:55,372
Oh, my God!

131
00:18:57,486 --> 00:18:59,616
Isn't that impressive.

132
00:19:01,544 --> 00:19:04,058
Nick, I'm confused.

133
00:19:04,954 --> 00:19:06,714
You expected to kill.

134
00:19:06,914 --> 00:19:09,333
<i>You job is to kill.</i>

135
00:19:09,629 --> 00:19:13,571
You didn't.
I don't like that.

136
00:19:14,127 --> 00:19:20,084
I said I'd fight I didn't say I'd kill.
This whole thing is sick. I quit.

137
00:19:20,531 --> 00:19:26,279
Nicky, you don't understand.
You do what we tell you to do.

138
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:31,210
You're my boy Nick you're gonna
become the prize in my state.

139
00:19:36,405 --> 00:19:37,929
We own now.

140
00:19:38,129 --> 00:19:44,378
Oh yeah? Nobody wants me come on
Goldilocks. See what you got.

141
00:19:44,578 --> 00:19:46,668
Goldilocks?

142
00:21:02,017 --> 00:21:06,411
Nick. this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

143
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,670
Absolutely no regard
for my authority.

144
00:21:13,818 --> 00:21:19,640
I hate a mess.
Take him out of here.

145
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:13,427
When the phone rings
you take the message

146
00:22:13,627 --> 00:22:16,100
you put the message
here in this basket, Okay?

147

Yes. Mr. Larson,

149
00:22:23,498 --> 00:22:27,149

00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:28,300

By the way a message came for you.

There's something wrong?

155
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:49,689
Yeah! A friend of mine in Los
Angeles looks like he's in trouble.

156
00:22:49,889 --> 00:22:51,772
I'm sorry.

157
00:22:51,972 --> 00:22:55,504
Well look why don't you come with
me and I'll show you the work area.

158
00:22:55,802 --> 00:22:59,219
Miss McKenna I'm afraid

159
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,476
Excuse me?

160
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:03,176
I got to get back to LA,

161
00:23:03,376 --> 00:23:07,179
Mr. Larson we have been holding
this position open for you.

162
00:23:07,379 --> 00:23:08,566

Yeah, maybe

164
00:23:55,785 --> 00:24:00,017
Hey mister you got anybody
to watch your bike?

165
00:24:00,217 --> 00:24:04,847
I'll watch it for a dollar. Watch it
real good nobody's gonna hurt it.

166
00:24:05,047 --> 00:24:07,293
Okay.

167
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:10,950
Watch my helmet.

168
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:28,837
Want something?

169
00:24:29,037 --> 00:24:31,965
Yeah! I'm looking for a gentleman
by the name of Nick Wallace.

170
00:24:32,165 --> 00:24:34,777
I think he's in the room 52.

171
00:24:35,858 --> 00:24:38,017
Something wrong?

172
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,901
He's been gone for a week.

173
00:24:41,805 --> 00:24:43,412
- What?
- Disappear.

174
00:24:44,478 --> 00:24:49,345
Nice kid. Wants to be a boxer.
You need a room?

175
00:24:50,346 --> 00:24:52,729
Yeah, yes I do.

176
00:24:56,327 --> 00:25:00,222
Sign this.
Work?

177
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:09,297
40 bucks.
In advance.

178
00:25:20,566 --> 00:25:24,565
- Room 22, up stair.
- Thanks.

179
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:29,444
Oh, so you have to see Nick can
you make sure tell I'm here.

180
00:25:29,644 --> 00:25:32,145
Don't worry he's
owe me money, remember?

181
00:25:43,551 --> 00:25:46,251
- Hey leave it alone.
- You talking to me once?

182
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,519
- Yeah leave it alone.
- Is that's your, you want it?

183
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,954
It's a friend of mine he's
pay me to watch it for him.

184
00:25:52,154 --> 00:25:53,613
So will watch me
drive away on it then.

185
00:25:53,728 --> 00:25:56,789
You mess with the bike
you've gotta mess with me.

186
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:58,010
I don't think so.

187
00:26:00,161 --> 00:26:02,427
I warned you.

188
00:26:11,674 --> 00:26:14,274
The girl values my buck.

189
00:26:21,395 --> 00:26:24,639
Of course in the jobs just
go for employee of the week.

190
00:26:49,189 --> 00:26:52,524
- Where did you learn that?
- In the streets.

191
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,116
- Come on, let me take you in home.
- I am home.

192
00:26:57,232 --> 00:27:00,306
- Well, you live here?
- No, around here.

193
00:27:00,421 --> 00:27:03,919
- Where's your family?
- None of your business.

194
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:07,930
I guess not.
You're hungry?

195
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:13,618
- Come on, let's eat.
- You're not a pervert or anything like?

196
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,538
So, what are you doing that hotel?

197
00:27:19,762 --> 00:27:22,206
Look before a friend of mine.

198
00:27:27,256 --> 00:27:29,960
What was the last time you ate?

199
00:27:31,829 --> 00:27:33,808
Your friend's in trouble or something?

200
00:27:34,008 --> 00:27:37,006
Yeah, he's kind of like you
he's always in trouble.

201
00:27:37,585 --> 00:27:39,144
<i>You know where he is?</i>

202
00:27:39,344 --> 00:27:42,165
No. I know he's around here somewhere.

203
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,306
- You know your way around.
- Not exactly.

204
00:27:47,716 --> 00:27:49,522
Were you from?

205
00:27:49,704 --> 00:27:54,869
Everywhere. Started off in New York working
the docks, then I move to west.

206
00:27:55,397 --> 00:27:57,592
How are you gonna find your friend
if you don't know your way around?

207
00:27:57,792 --> 00:28:01,824
You need a guide homey. You need
someone who knows the streets.

208
00:28:02,987 --> 00:28:04,898
Well you wouldn't just happen to know one,
would you?

209
00:28:05,098 --> 00:28:07,526
Don't be a jerk I know the streets.

210
00:28:09,249 --> 00:28:11,984
All right what's this gonna cost me?

211
00:28:14,108 --> 00:28:18,700
- Your bike.
- My bike, get real, kid.

212
00:28:18,815 --> 00:28:20,380
I'm not a kid.
I'm Tommy.

213
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:24,361
If I help you find your friend
you can give me your bike.

214
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:29,437
Well, you drive a hard bargain kid.
I mean, Tommy.

215
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:31,469
We have a deal?

216
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:36,084
No, you never heard the one
about easy money, have you?

217
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,222
You see this guy around?

218
00:28:57,536 --> 00:28:59,752
- Yeah, I see around.
- Have where?

219
00:28:59,952 --> 00:29:01,810
Some private class,
in downtown.

220
00:29:02,097 --> 00:29:03,340
What do you mean private?

221
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,955
Either hard to find unless you
have the right connection.

222
00:29:07,155 --> 00:29:08,428
Do you?

223
00:29:08,628 --> 00:29:11,729
I stay away from those kind of
places they can get pretty hairy.

224
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,902
Your friends hanging
around with this guys,

225
00:29:14,102 --> 00:29:16,360
get a lot of trouble.

226
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,334
Let's say where
I want to find a place?

227
00:29:19,534 --> 00:29:21,007
<i>Chinatown.</i>

228
00:29:42,674 --> 00:29:45,465
POLICE STATION

229
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,243
Thanks.

230
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,959
No, I'm sorry.

231
00:30:04,171 --> 00:30:08,457
I'll try that Danny Richardson.
Thanks, sir.

232
00:30:23,652 --> 00:30:27,040
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for Danny Richardson.

233
00:30:27,155 --> 00:30:30,250
Sir, up the stairs turn to the
right second door on the left.

234
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,450
Thanks.

235
00:30:50,486 --> 00:30:52,387
Can I help you?

236
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:56,110
I'm looking for Danny Richardson,
you see him around?

237
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,867
He's not around, she is.

238
00:30:57,982 --> 00:31:02,083
- I'm Danny Richardson.
- I'm sorry, the name Danny...

239
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:07,287
Short for Danielle. My father's revenge
against my mother for not having a boy.

240
00:31:07,623 --> 00:31:08,696
What can I do for you?

241
00:31:08,896 --> 00:31:12,799
My name is John Larson. I'm looking for
a gentleman by the name of Nick Wallace.

242
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:17,593
- How'd you find me Mr. Larson?
- I was over at the hospital Sears.

243
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:18,642
They sent me over here,
Dr. Newman.

244
00:31:18,842 --> 00:31:22,912
That's all I need. My workload
added on to by Peter Newman.

245
00:31:33,147 --> 00:31:36,333
- What did he tell you I would do for you?
- Well he didn't actually say.

246
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:41,707
This is not a lost-and-found Bureau and
if Dr. Newman told you, that he's wrong.

247
00:31:42,695 --> 00:31:48,076
- Good day, miss Richardson.
<i>- Hold it I'm sorry. Have a seat.</i>

248
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,150
Maybe I can help you
or at least I'm gonna try.

249
00:31:58,682 --> 00:32:01,541
Well he's not in here at
the diner if somebody

250
00:32:01,741 --> 00:32:04,091
found his body at being my computer.

251
00:32:05,255 --> 00:32:08,096
What about your friend
in LA in the first place?

252
00:32:08,236 --> 00:32:10,974
We came here together
work the docks for a while.

253
00:32:11,174 --> 00:32:15,222
And when that ended I split.
He stayed.

254
00:32:16,355 --> 00:32:19,173
<i>- What do you do?</i>
- Longshoreman.

255
00:32:19,377 --> 00:32:21,130
Nick is a kickboxer though
he said who's gonna

256
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,161
fight for some promoter
by the name of Landis.

257
00:32:23,361 --> 00:32:24,361
Paul Landis?

258
00:32:24,557 --> 00:32:27,314
<i>No first names just
Landis that's all I know.</i>

259
00:32:27,635 --> 00:32:30,215
<i>Is there anything I should know?</i>

260
00:32:30,438 --> 00:32:36,403
Paul Landis is a pretty heavy name
if your friend mixed up with him.

261
00:32:36,518 --> 00:32:38,386
What it mean?

262
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:42,756
Landis is a gangster not the kind of guy
anyone with half a brain would work for one.

263
00:32:42,956 --> 00:32:45,003
Nick wouldn't work
for anybody like that.

264
00:32:45,203 --> 00:32:47,916
You'd be surprised what
people will do for money.

265
00:32:48,116 --> 00:32:51,181
Not Nick, is not like this.

266
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:52,985
That's I telling you.

267
00:32:53,185 --> 00:32:56,278
Ok, you get me some
more information on this Landis guy.

268
00:32:56,481 --> 00:33:01,418
I've got to find Nick.
If Nick's in trouble I gotta help him.

269
00:33:01,533 --> 00:33:03,624
It will get me in trouble.

270
00:33:03,824 --> 00:33:07,690
But okay meet me across the
street in the park in an hour.

271
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,536
Thank you.

272
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:11,196
Look here's the deal.

273
00:33:11,396 --> 00:33:15,421
I'll help you find your friend if
you help me get a story out of this.

274
00:33:15,944 --> 00:33:17,661
- A history?
- On Landis.

275
00:33:17,861 --> 00:33:22,806
An expose on him can get me out of it
read apartment and into the newsroom.

276
00:33:23,148 --> 00:33:28,088
- Well, why not, you got a deal.
- Just remember, I call the shots.

277
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:32,243
Yes ma'am.
Whatever you say.

278
00:33:32,603 --> 00:33:36,215
- She giving you trouble?
- Who's your friend?

279
00:33:36,589 --> 00:33:40,093
Tommy this is that reporter I told
you about, Danielle Richardson.

280
00:33:40,293 --> 00:33:42,204
She don't look
like no reporter to me.

281
00:33:42,733 --> 00:33:46,706
- She's your sister?
- You must be reporter, you're pretty nosy.

282
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,861
- Where'd you find her?
- She's okay.

283
00:34:12,598 --> 00:34:14,534
We just talked to
one of the fight managers...

284
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:16,372
that said your friend
fought here last week.

285
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,843
No one's seen him since.

286
00:34:19,095 --> 00:34:21,693
- Nobody else?
- That's it.

287
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,007
Is Landis right there.

288
00:37:40,974 --> 00:37:43,833
I saw enough.
Let's get out of here.

289
00:37:58,083 --> 00:37:59,850
<i>Who's the big guy?</i>

290
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:03,212
Mark Vanik.
We work for Landis.

291
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:04,784
Looks like a real psycho.

292
00:38:04,984 --> 00:38:07,457
Sort of puts you two in
the same boat doesn't it?

293
00:38:07,572 --> 00:38:11,212
You would also hurt
people for money?

294
00:38:11,436 --> 00:38:14,986
First of all I never fought for the
money I fight from the competition.

295
00:38:15,186 --> 00:38:17,302
Second of all.
I'm not into that anymore.

296
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,907
I grew out of it.

297
00:38:20,022 --> 00:38:21,883
<i>And yeah Nick fights for money.</i>

298
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:25,725
But he's never permanently damaged
anybody at least not on purpose.

299
00:38:25,961 --> 00:38:28,768
Now what do you say we get started?

300
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:40,406
- What are we doing here?
- Getting you an audition.

301
00:38:40,606 --> 00:38:42,326
What's that supposed to mean?

302
00:38:42,543 --> 00:38:47,434
I've done a little research on you,
Mr. Larson, once a champion kickboxer.

303
00:38:47,644 --> 00:38:49,695
There's only one way to get
Paul Landis interested in you.

304
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:51,166
And that's to fight
for one his manager's.

305
00:38:51,366 --> 00:38:54,412
I told you, I'm not in it anymore.
I don't fight competitions anymore.

306
00:38:54,612 --> 00:38:58,185
- Do you want to find your friend?
- You know it does.

307
00:38:58,907 --> 00:39:02,446
Okay look I may be new at this
but at least we're making progress.

308
00:39:02,646 --> 00:39:04,633
If do you haven't been
able to find him your way,

309
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:06,345
so why don't we try it mine?

310
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:08,470
Your way could get me her hurt?

311
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,519
Hurt and you could be kill.

312
00:39:11,142 --> 00:39:15,513
- But I bet you find your friend.
- Excuse me, do you have light?

313
00:39:15,916 --> 00:39:18,938
Get lost.
It belongs to me.

314
00:39:20,246 --> 00:39:21,790
Now what'd you go and do that for,

315
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,861
I was just getting to know her.

316
00:39:24,858 --> 00:39:26,519
You see that man over there?

317
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:27,920
<i>His name is Big Man.</i>

318
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,510
He's a fight manager.

319
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:34,831
Wait here a minute. Oh, by the way, try
not to touch anything while I'm gone.

320
00:39:37,073 --> 00:39:39,241
May I can take a beer?

321
00:39:43,561 --> 00:39:45,665
Well, you just gorgeous.

322
00:39:45,865 --> 00:39:49,986
What's a beautiful lady
like you doing in here?

323
00:39:50,306 --> 00:39:52,975
You're buying or selling?

324
00:39:54,345 --> 00:39:57,694
- You're Big Man?
- Lionel P. Big Man.

325
00:39:57,809 --> 00:40:00,705
Call me Big Man.
Who's asking, what do you want?

326
00:40:00,905 --> 00:40:02,784
I'm here to do you a favor.

327
00:40:02,912 --> 00:40:08,463
- Do I get to pick the position?
- Biggie, you're so funny.

328
00:40:09,081 --> 00:40:11,616
You see that guy over there at the bar?

329
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:17,100
He's the best fighter I've ever seen
and he's looking to make some money.

330
00:40:17,546 --> 00:40:19,501
Him?

331
00:40:20,761 --> 00:40:23,308
Don't toy with me.
I got all the fighters I want.

332
00:40:23,508 --> 00:40:26,404
You know, they're all winners.
Look at your guys you he's unproven.

333
00:40:26,604 --> 00:40:28,702
- Yeah, it will be...
- Hey, listen...

334
00:40:28,902 --> 00:40:31,452
- I'll tell you what I do like about it.
- What's that?

335
00:40:31,652 --> 00:40:32,652
His girlfriend.

336
00:40:34,686 --> 00:40:37,090
Make a little deal with
you here's what I'll do.

337
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,374
You well, you take a little
ride on the big man express

338
00:40:40,574 --> 00:40:43,309
and now I'll talk to you
about your boyfriend.

339
00:40:43,424 --> 00:40:44,618
That's your best offer?

340
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:47,518
It's my only offer and
it's a real good one too.

341
00:40:47,718 --> 00:40:52,507
Because that I'd last a lot longer with you
than you would with my boys.

342
00:40:52,722 --> 00:40:56,546
- Oh yeah, Mr. Big Man?
- You call me Biggy.

343
00:40:57,945 --> 00:41:00,697
I prefer to eat glass.

344
00:41:02,451 --> 00:41:05,523
Your manager over there tells me
you guys claim to be fighters.

345
00:41:05,723 --> 00:41:07,451
- Yeah.
- Well...

346
00:41:07,651 --> 00:41:10,136
I've got a hundred 100
bucks that says the guy

347
00:41:10,336 --> 00:41:12,932
over there at the bar
can kick all your asses.

348
00:41:18,465 --> 00:41:21,172
Have you fine
and let her go.

349
00:41:54,963 --> 00:41:59,169
- That was amazing.
- Not really. They were drunk.

350
00:41:59,895 --> 00:42:03,788
- What's your name?
- John Larson.

351
00:42:04,382 --> 00:42:06,972
Meet your new manager.

352
00:42:22,129 --> 00:42:24,881
Pretty good.
Very impressive.

353
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:26,446
That was easy.

354
00:42:26,646 --> 00:42:29,764
So, if you'd be in the stakes,
how could I mess up?

355
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:33,750
I did know tough guys
did that sort of thing.

356
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:37,165
Even tough guys
appreciate a beautiful woman.

357
00:42:37,658 --> 00:42:42,161
You really laugh.
Try this more often.

358
00:42:50,389 --> 00:42:53,011
- Good night.
- Good night.

359
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:22,633
You know?
I don't trust Han.

360
00:43:23,213 --> 00:43:26,681
- Let me worry about Ham.
- You just don't get it, do you?

361
00:43:26,796 --> 00:43:30,620
You think a guy like Han is just
gonna let us take over his operation?

362
00:43:31,131 --> 00:43:36,403
If I deliver to Han what
he wants he'll play ball. unless...

363
00:43:36,707 --> 00:43:39,076
- Unless what?
- Unless we eliminate him.

364
00:43:39,276 --> 00:43:42,491
Eliminated?
Are you crazy, man?

365
00:43:45,432 --> 00:43:49,273
Maybe it's time that I make
some decisions around here.

366
00:43:50,686 --> 00:43:55,691
No, don't challenge me
It just wouldn't be healthy.

367
00:44:11,062 --> 00:44:13,614
So we go in there the
collective dough right.

368
00:44:13,814 --> 00:44:16,366
I tell nocking head
to get his piece.

369
00:44:16,482 --> 00:44:19,473
Hey come on you gotta
tell everybody about it?

370
00:44:19,673 --> 00:44:22,665
And then? I look at it?
And I'm looking at it?

371
00:44:23,044 --> 00:44:28,387
- Essa coisa é de plástico.
- Isso foi um erro.

372
00:44:29,293 --> 00:44:31,896
Jimmie just got whacking and
these guys are laughing?

373
00:44:32,096 --> 00:44:33,670
You're worried too much.

374
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:37,272
He had it coming.
He was arrogant weak and stupid.

375
00:44:37,387 --> 00:44:40,934
And he let his guard down.
Bad mistake.

376
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:43,184
Never ever did
let your guard down.

377
00:44:43,384 --> 00:44:46,601
You let the guard down, everybody
takes an advantage over you.

378
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:50,639
Look at me. I took
advantage of my enemy's.

379
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:54,155
Italian suit,
Italian shoes, a gold watch.

380
00:44:54,355 --> 00:44:56,649
Money and a
200 $ haircut Hey.

381
00:44:56,849 --> 00:44:59,368
What more do you want?
Is that all right?

382
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:03,854
Look this place.
Is like a fortress.

383
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:46,818
It's not pretty good
day for you uh, Vincent.

384
00:45:47,018 --> 00:45:49,358
The spirits must really be upset.

385
00:45:52,204 --> 00:45:55,316
Look at your aura,
it's fading.

386
00:45:56,064 --> 00:45:58,742
Lazzard, you bastard.

387
00:46:36,809 --> 00:46:40,326
Is it kid, this ain't no bar brawl.
this is it!

388
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:51,608
Concentrate, don't worry
about the crowd. Win this Fight.

389
00:48:52,577 --> 00:48:53,693
<i>There are two types of fighters,</i>

390
00:48:53,893 --> 00:48:55,497
<i>there's a chess player
and check the player</i>

391
00:48:55,613 --> 00:48:57,424
<i>A chess player take two
hits and give one.</i>

392
00:48:57,624 --> 00:49:00,160
<i>A check player would never take
any and give four five and six</i>

393
00:49:00,275 --> 00:49:02,245
<i>- What are you?</i>
- Chess player.

394
00:49:02,445 --> 00:49:03,340
<i>OK, let's work.</i>

395
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:08,316
Work their jab work that jab.
The jab that took to the body.

396
00:49:08,902 --> 00:49:13,986
Jab. kick all my constituents.
Punch, kick, left hook.

397
00:49:15,064 --> 00:49:18,117
<i>Understand that's warrior is about.</i>

398
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:22,151
<i>You gotta focus.</i>

399
00:49:24,526 --> 00:49:27,686
<i>you gotta control those
motions under pressure.</i>

400
00:49:28,768 --> 00:49:32,235
<i>It's not all hard you hit,
is all right you hit.</i>

401
00:49:34,153 --> 00:49:36,634
<i>Knowledge is power.</i>

402
00:49:37,275 --> 00:49:41,123
<i>Use the power of knowledge
and experience you have, planning up.</i>

403
00:50:21,275 --> 00:50:23,170
<i>Why LA?</i>

404
00:50:23,285 --> 00:50:28,888
It's home. I wouldn't wait for a while
though, you know? College, little travel.

405
00:50:29,512 --> 00:50:31,793
But I came back.

406
00:50:32,013 --> 00:50:33,212
College, huh?

407
00:50:33,412 --> 00:50:36,584
I've been thinking about
going back to school myself.

408
00:50:36,968 --> 00:50:40,196
Maybe someday.
Your folks?

409
00:50:40,834 --> 00:50:45,715
My mom died about years ago and my
dad that's on a ranch outside solving.

410
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:50,101
But we're very close you know.
It's all the family I have.

411
00:50:50,601 --> 00:50:54,300
An only child I should've guessed.
That one the attitude comes from.

412
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:59,165
Hey look Buster. On the streets of LA you
need an attitude or you'll be eaten alive.

413
00:51:00,332 --> 00:51:02,767
I guess you got a point there.

414
00:51:04,636 --> 00:51:07,696
You really don't like fighting, do you?

415
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:13,762
- No no anymore.
- What for?

416
00:51:17,203 --> 00:51:20,863
Three years ago I had my last fight.

417
00:51:21,751 --> 00:51:27,603
I want a championship of the world.
My opponent died in the ring.

418
00:51:29,292 --> 00:51:33,656
- John, he knew the risk.
- Yeah, I know.

419
00:51:35,215 --> 00:51:37,953
He had a wife and two kids.

420
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:49,634
- What?
- Thanks.

421
00:52:03,214 --> 00:52:06,596
Watch this guy, he's tough.
He's one the best fighters in Japan.

422
00:52:06,711 --> 00:52:08,930
<i>Don't let him get to you
first because if he does,</i>

423
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:11,605
next thing you're gonna hear
is the fat lady sing, right?

424
00:52:11,805 --> 00:52:12,930
Don't worry.

425
00:52:12,934 --> 00:52:16,225
The world promotor: Landis.
Stay away from him.

426
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,479
- Why?
- Don't worry about that.

427
00:52:18,679 --> 00:52:22,354
You gotta fight for them let's just get out
there and kick this guy's ass, all right?

428
00:53:55,293 --> 00:53:57,728
<i>You gotta focus.</i>

429
00:53:59,692 --> 00:54:02,041
<i>Knowledge is power.</i>

430
00:54:05,184 --> 00:54:08,075
<i>Understand what a
warrior is all about.</i>

431
00:55:40,223 --> 00:55:42,680
Winner! Winner!

432
00:55:43,392 --> 00:55:46,339
Man, you were great!

433
00:55:46,862 --> 00:55:49,311
You kill that guy.

434
00:55:58,912 --> 00:56:00,967
You did good.

435
00:56:02,289 --> 00:56:05,545
<i>You and me gonna be rich.</i>

436
00:56:05,933 --> 00:56:08,921
I hope there's enough
in that deal for me.

437
00:56:09,707 --> 00:56:13,011
Excuse us for interrupt you,
my name is Paul Landis.

438
00:56:13,211 --> 00:56:15,164
This is my partner, Mark Vanik.

439
00:56:15,279 --> 00:56:19,329
- We're our fight promoters.
- Yeah I've heard of you guys.

440
00:56:19,444 --> 00:56:22,909
<i>- Oh good, I hope.</i>
- From another fighter.

441
00:56:23,211 --> 00:56:26,622
- Nick Wallace.
- Wallace? Wallace?

442
00:56:26,822 --> 00:56:29,323
- Something ring a bell?
- Not once.

443
00:56:29,979 --> 00:56:34,046
No I'm sorry. Then I work with
so many different fighters.

444
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:37,619
- Where are you from?
- I've just got into town from up north.

445
00:56:37,819 --> 00:56:38,819
I see.

446
00:56:39,569 --> 00:56:43,572
- And who is this lovely young lady?
- Danielle Richardson.

447
00:56:43,854 --> 00:56:45,707
My pleasure.

448
00:56:46,216 --> 00:56:48,340
I'm having a little party at
my place tomorrow afternoon.

449
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:52,144
I'd like you and your young
friend here to be my guest.

450
00:56:52,891 --> 00:56:58,065
- I think you'll find it very profitable.
- Well I'd have to move by my manager.

451
00:56:58,934 --> 00:57:04,585
Oh, by all means bring your funny
little friend along. Will be funny.

452
00:57:08,143 --> 00:57:12,172
I'll have my chauffeur pick
you up say one o'clock?

453
00:57:15,004 --> 00:57:17,133
One would be fine.

454
00:57:27,507 --> 00:57:29,639
Little friend, huh.

455
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:32,992
I told you to stay away from him
what do you want to drop dead?

456
00:57:33,192 --> 00:57:37,507
Calm down nobody's gonna die.
What harm can come from one party?

457
00:57:37,622 --> 00:57:40,182
Don't be fooled by him.
He could trap you

458
00:57:40,382 --> 00:57:43,255
like a spider traps a fly.
I've seen him do it.

459
00:57:46,384 --> 00:57:49,057
You know where I'm
from there's an old story.

460
00:57:49,306 --> 00:57:54,573
The Emperor once gave our entire province
to a great warlord named Chow Lee.

461
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,930
At first Chow Lee was
very honorable and loyal,

462
00:57:57,130 --> 00:57:59,436
and this came him much
favor with the Emperor.

463
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:01,979
Who in turn gave him
his prized horse.

464
00:58:02,094 --> 00:58:06,019
Then Chow Lee began to steal
tax monies do the Emperor.

465
00:58:06,321 --> 00:58:09,031
The Emperor had him punished
for his greed in his loyalty.

466
00:58:09,146 --> 00:58:14,291
He had him dragged through the entire
province on the very horse he had given him.

467
00:58:14,415 --> 00:58:19,199
So you see Mr. Landis,
when it comes to greed and loyalty...

468
00:58:19,575 --> 00:58:22,125
they're mortal enemies.

469
00:58:22,935 --> 00:58:25,329
What an interesting story.

470
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:40,308
Yes fine European craftsmanship.
Rolex, Mercedes, Mac-10.

471
00:58:40,508 --> 00:58:42,848
- Know how they're all the same.
- No, Rolex is Swiss.

472
00:58:43,048 --> 00:58:46,032
They're all the same
doesn't matter.

473
00:58:47,582 --> 00:58:51,379
- How much?
- Ten boxes. $ 500.000.

474
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:55,168
Shipping cost,
They're be yours.

475
00:58:56,761 --> 00:59:00,931
250 now, 250 on delivery.
We split the cost of shipping.

476
00:59:01,046 --> 00:59:05,651
I supply the ship, you
supply the crew. Deal?

477
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:12,253
- Deal.
- Ok, we get a deal.

478
00:59:57,526 --> 01:00:00,067
Here comes you majesty.

479
01:00:01,618 --> 01:00:04,747
John, glad you can make it.

480
01:00:07,123 --> 01:00:09,816
Miss Richardson.
The lovely Mr. Richardson.

481
01:00:10,016 --> 01:00:13,190
Why Mr. Landis? Are you always
this charming with all your guests?

482
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:14,612
Only the beautiful one.

483
01:00:16,227 --> 01:00:20,582
- You think I'm wearing a crystal.
- I don't know much about them.

484
01:00:20,697 --> 01:00:25,131
They do it power you they
could change your life.

485
01:00:26,328 --> 01:00:30,046
Mark, you remember John?

486
01:00:30,718 --> 01:00:32,531
Of course yes.

487
01:00:34,475 --> 01:00:37,957
Excuse me, I'm going
entertain the guests.

488
01:00:38,702 --> 01:00:43,871
- What do you think of our little party.
- That's great. Nice place.

489
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:47,127
Could you do me a favor
and entertain miss Richardson?

490
01:00:47,327 --> 01:00:49,526
Well, John and I
talk a little business.

491
01:00:57,769 --> 01:01:00,992
- Do you wanna something to drink, John?
- No, thanks.

492
01:01:01,191 --> 01:01:02,984
Sit please.

493
01:01:12,362 --> 01:01:15,179
Ah, my computers.

494
01:01:15,916 --> 01:01:19,999
They are my eyes and ears.
See I have international business interests.

495
01:01:20,114 --> 01:01:24,126
My computers give me a
small edge on the competition.

496
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:29,071
Once in a while
a slight edge.

497
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:41,962
- I'm sorry I didn't know that was valuable.
- You have to be very careful with crystals.

498
01:01:42,396 --> 01:01:45,910
This one happens to be
related to my personal aura.

499
01:01:46,228 --> 01:01:49,762
And someone is holding if they
could drain off my energies.

500
01:01:49,976 --> 01:01:53,275
Like my computer's, they give me
a slight edge on my competition.

501
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:57,119
Crystals, auras.
You hardly seen the type.

502
01:01:57,347 --> 01:02:00,843
If it wasn't for this crystal
I wouldn't be as powerful as I am.

503
01:02:01,043 --> 01:02:04,283
I'm sorry I didn't
mean a disrespect.

504
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:08,709
I'll come right to the point, John.
I'd like you to fight for me.

505
01:02:08,968 --> 01:02:10,316
I've already got a manager.

506
01:02:10,516 --> 01:02:14,212
I can guarantee you'll make more money
with me and you could ever imagine.

507
01:02:14,636 --> 01:02:18,674
And you and your young
lady comfortable for a long time.

508
01:02:19,158 --> 01:02:23,114
- I'd have to think about it.
- Take your time.

509
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:27,452
You know where to find me.
But in the meantime...

510
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:30,035
enjoy yourself.

511
01:03:04,424 --> 01:03:08,481
- Be right back.
- I think I have been sick.

512
01:03:21,076 --> 01:03:25,402
- And your shirt?
- Do not ask.

513
01:03:32,185 --> 01:03:36,991
What a smell.
The shower is over there.

514
01:03:37,191 --> 01:03:38,191
Thanks.

515
01:03:42,802 --> 01:03:47,928
<i>- Are you allright there?</i>
- Yeah. I will Survive. I think.

516
01:06:07,212 --> 01:06:10,632
- You still have a hangover?
- You're an idiot.

517
01:06:11,045 --> 01:06:14,289
- That's supossed to means?
- I know Landis e Vanik.

518
01:06:14,404 --> 01:06:16,058
You know?
You're dumber than a...

519
01:06:16,258 --> 01:06:18,314
housefly with with a metal plate
in his head you know that?

520
01:06:18,514 --> 01:06:20,887
Is that any way to talk the man
it's gonna make you rich?

521
01:06:21,274 --> 01:06:27,126
Listen. Landis will use you.
He puts you in a "Death March".

522
01:06:27,326 --> 01:06:28,175
What it mean "Death Match"?

523
01:06:28,375 --> 01:06:31,897
You know that. Two guys get in the
ring and they fight it out fo somebody dead.

524
01:06:32,012 --> 01:06:35,003
Landis and his rich
buddies bent on that stuff.

525
01:06:35,203 --> 01:06:36,763
I don't believe that.

526
01:06:37,029 --> 01:06:41,970
- You end up just like the other guy.
- What other guy?

527
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:45,838
It was a fight of the Landis.
He didn't do what Landis wanted him to.

528
01:06:46,038 --> 01:06:48,322
Suddenly he's gone.
Nobody see him since.

529
01:06:48,612 --> 01:06:52,785
- You know his name?
- Something that Wallace.

530
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:56,941
- Nick Wallace?
- I don't know. I don't care.

531
01:06:57,975 --> 01:07:02,372
- He's dead?
- Could be, who knows?

532
01:07:02,572 --> 01:07:05,174
Really?
Who cares, you know?

533
01:07:16,431 --> 01:07:18,239
You sure?

534
01:07:19,457 --> 01:07:22,557
Yeah. I guess I'm too late.

535
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:26,090
- We should go to the police.
- Tell them what?

536
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:29,679
- There is not even a body.
<i>- Maybe he's not dead.</i>

537
01:07:31,629 --> 01:07:33,637
I don't know.

538
01:07:34,399 --> 01:07:37,663
I need something evidences.

539
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:44,318
I should have my
head examined to go...

540
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:46,218
along with the plan like this
you're gonna get yourself killed.

541
01:07:46,333 --> 01:07:48,673
No, I won't. You just make sure
here when I get back.

542
01:07:48,873 --> 01:07:50,479
I got to get this computer.

543
01:07:50,594 --> 01:07:52,617
What do you expect to find in there?

544
01:07:52,817 --> 01:07:55,333
I don't know anything to
bring those bastards down.

545
01:07:55,448 --> 01:07:57,739
I had to go.
I'll be back.

546
01:08:03,831 --> 01:08:05,783
Be carefull.

547
01:08:18,628 --> 01:08:20,417
Thanks.

548
01:09:38,192 --> 01:09:39,192
Bingo!

549
01:09:47,334 --> 01:09:49,370
HAN/ARMS SHIPMENT

550
01:10:11,067 --> 01:10:12,939
ACESS DENIED!

551
01:11:00,659 --> 01:11:03,207
What are you waiting for?
Come on in.

552
01:11:21,133 --> 01:11:22,503
Could you go any faster?

553
01:11:22,703 --> 01:11:25,725
I was going any faster
we'd be in the Indy 500.

554
01:11:31,902 --> 01:11:34,891
What's the matter, tough guy?
Brain women driver?

555
01:11:42,812 --> 01:11:44,928
We got one more left.

556
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:56,268
Let's turn back here.

557
01:12:17,985 --> 01:12:20,437
Someone broke into the study.

558
01:12:38,071 --> 01:12:42,243
Why?
Why?

559
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:54,237
So what did he get?

560
01:12:55,391 --> 01:12:57,248
Enough.

561
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,851
Tell me why.

562
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:08,156
Tell me why.

563
01:13:09,491 --> 01:13:14,282
Just give me one good reason
why I shouldn't kill you right now?

564
01:13:19,482 --> 01:13:21,377
Get out.

565
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:29,752
Why don't we see what we get.

566
01:13:54,681 --> 01:13:57,045
A rat in the kitchen.

567
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,316
Find him.

568
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:14,948
What are we gonna do?
We've got to take these files to police.

569
01:14:15,148 --> 01:14:19,424
I wouldn't trust the police.
Landis had his hands on bought at that spot.

570
01:14:19,539 --> 01:14:24,386
Então vamos publicá-lo.
Então a polícia precisa ouvir.

571
01:14:24,536 --> 01:14:27,674
This is true, but
you will lose your story.

572
01:14:27,789 --> 01:14:29,622
I don't get about the
storyright now right now.

573
01:14:29,822 --> 01:14:32,185
We've got more important
things to think about.

574
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:44,476
Go ahead if you and your friends
want to look like Swiss cheese.

575
01:15:01,796 --> 01:15:07,152
I know I'm really disappointed in you, John.
Very disappointed.

576
01:15:07,731 --> 01:15:10,633
We give you the chance to be
a rich man and what do you do?

577
01:15:10,833 --> 01:15:11,721
What did he do?

578
01:15:11,836 --> 01:15:14,669
- You ripped us off.
- He ripped us off.

579
01:15:16,928 --> 01:15:21,319
I'll give you one minute to tell us
who you are who you work for,

580
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:23,732
and where the files.

581
01:15:26,518 --> 01:15:30,915
I say who?
Who? The cops? Han?

582
01:15:41,112 --> 01:15:45,333
You think he's losing it?
You're probably right.

583
01:15:45,767 --> 01:15:50,886
But you see he gets real pissed off when
someone breaks into my house and steals.

584
01:15:51,783 --> 01:15:56,373
So let's try it again.
Who sent you?

585
01:15:57,968 --> 01:16:01,161
- Who sent you?
- Nobody sente me, man.

586
01:16:01,357 --> 01:16:05,884
I'm here to find my friend, Nick Wallace,
the fighter I told you about.

587
01:16:06,084 --> 01:16:08,011
Wallace? Wallace?

588
01:16:08,211 --> 01:16:08,994
You're liyng.

589
01:16:09,194 --> 01:16:12,569
Oh no man, it's true.
I don't want nothing from you.

590
01:16:15,471 --> 01:16:20,030
Wallace is here and still alive.
Who knows, maybe I will kill him now.

591
01:16:20,145 --> 01:16:22,653
We get this straight.
You're not with Interpol,

592
01:16:22,853 --> 01:16:25,475
you're not with the
police or that guy Han?

593
01:16:25,609 --> 01:16:28,714
You've been trying to take me
down because of a friend.

594
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:33,771
Let the girls go and
I give your files.

595
01:16:35,125 --> 01:16:39,992
I'm gonna kill them all except for
the girl who I'm making around.

596
01:16:40,192 --> 01:16:43,448
As far as my files,
you can have to.

597
01:16:43,868 --> 01:16:49,240
- Buster, I kill you, man.
- Correction, we gonna kill you.

598
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:01,244
- Where are the girls?
- What girls?

599
01:18:01,426 --> 01:18:03,510
That's not why I want to hear.

600
01:18:09,274 --> 01:18:10,274
John!

601
01:18:15,055 --> 01:18:17,287
We're gotta get out of this place.

602
01:18:17,751 --> 01:18:21,527
- I was thinking where were you.
- Don't even think about it.

603
01:18:21,727 --> 01:18:23,261
You'd be dead.

604
01:18:23,461 --> 01:18:25,854
Let the girls go.

605
01:18:26,812 --> 01:18:29,056
Not till after the show.

606
01:18:37,726 --> 01:18:40,451
You wanna play?
Let's play!

607
01:20:02,332 --> 01:20:05,119
- It's all right?
- Better find Landis.

608
01:20:05,234 --> 01:20:07,932
I have to find Nick first.

609
01:20:16,189 --> 01:20:17,189
Nick.

610
01:20:18,244 --> 01:20:19,244
Oh, man!

611
01:20:20,461 --> 01:20:23,238
You move?
You all right?

612
01:20:23,438 --> 01:20:25,154
I've been better.

613
01:20:25,568 --> 01:20:28,364
- You think you can walk?
- I can try.

614
01:20:28,926 --> 01:20:33,332
- Where have you been so far?
- I was in a traffic jam.

615
01:20:34,850 --> 01:20:37,720
That's it we got to get out of here.
Get Nick off the boat.

616
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,219
I'm going after Landis.

617
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:41,727
Take this.
You may need it.

618
01:20:43,561 --> 01:20:46,116
Come on, we gotta
get you out of here.

619
01:24:25,822 --> 01:24:27,959
Tough day.

620
01:25:25,589 --> 01:25:29,476
Thanks bro, save my life.

621
01:25:29,691 --> 01:25:33,584
What choice that I have?
You still owe me 20 bucks.

622
01:25:39,265 --> 01:25:44,844
- So what's next cowboy?
- Well a shower would be nice.

623
01:25:45,876 --> 01:25:49,013
Honey, think you can
find a cheeseburger?

624
01:25:49,213 --> 01:25:50,213
Course.
