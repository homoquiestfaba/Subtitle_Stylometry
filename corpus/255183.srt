1
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,992
Sustained.
Proceed, Mr Schiff.

2
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,272
when you entered that
Suite 405 of the Holiday lnn.

3
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,914
Mr Lombardo was alone in
the room with Richard Colbert,

4
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,918
a deputy director of the
lnternal Revenue Service,

5
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,350
who was kneeling beside a coffee table
counting out stacks of $100 bills.

6
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,516
And will you tell the jury
how you knew of this...

7
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,350
Therefore, with probable cause,
you applied for a warrant?

8
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,916
- Yes, sir.
- Which Federal Judge Griffen granted.

9
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,996
Thank you. Your witness.

10
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,637
Agent Powell, as you know,
my client, Ed Lombardo,

11
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,991
- is charged with extortion.
- Yes, ma'am.

12
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,032
Did you observe Richard Colbert
when he first entered the hotel?

13
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,594
- Yes, ma'am.
- Was he carrying anything?

14
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,878
- No, ma'am.
- Why not?

15
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,594
We didn't want him to know
that we were there.

16
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,396
So Richard Colbert
could have conceivably brought
the $125,000 in with him.

17
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,479
He could or he could not have.

18
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,309
Your agency has a well-deserved
reputation for thoroughness.

19
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,954
Did you also investigate
Richard Colbert's background...

20
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,959
to ascertain why he might have
been carrying such a large sum?

21
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,674
- The man gambled.
- l'm sorry. l didn't hear that.

22
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,393
that Colbert came there
that night to place a bet?

23
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,399
Agent Powell, hadn't a division
of your task force been trying
to link Mr Lombardo...

24
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,635
- We have.
- And in those circles,

25
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,799
$125,000 would not be considered
an unusually large wager.

26
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,717
- Am l correct?
- l heard of bets like that.

27
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,957
And wasn't your arrest made just
two days before the Super Bowl?

28
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,349
- Yes.
- Agent Powell, did you--

29
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,878
- l've got everything l need.
- You're sensational, Counsellor.

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,594
- What would it take
to keep you on retainer?
- A lot.

31
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,395
Here's the situation:
The FBl had a Title lll wiretap
authorization, all right,

32
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,476
but it expired five days
before the arrest.

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,434
No, no, they followed the rules.
They pulled the tap.

34
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,233
Well, then how'd they find out
about a meeting that was planned
just the day before?

35
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,553
An FBl guy working inside
the Lombardo organization.

36
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,240
They're not gonna risk blowing his cover
to get a simple bribery conviction.

37
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,274
Don't worry. You won't.

38
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,159
No matter what l need,
you're always there for me.

39
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,750
Count on it. You know, if your mother
hadn't turned me down nine times,

40
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,757
l-l'd be your father.

41
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,431
ls it unethical for me to ask
just how you got your information?

42
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,632
Well, there's a secretary
over at the Justice Department.

43
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,035
And there is nothing
a 62-year-old woman won't do...

44
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,517
for a date with a six--
72-year-old man.

45
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,793
Goddam it! lt took us two and a half
years to get this man into position.

46
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,956
lt'll take them no time
to finger him and kill him!

47
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,116
My job is to get Ed Lombardo
off, not to aid and abet...

48
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,071
in exposing a federal
undercover agent.

49
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,919
My client knows nothing
about this conversation.

50
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,238
-Well, how can l rely
on you to keep quiet?
-Because l'm giving you my word!

51
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,757
l'll leave it to you two
to figure a way out of this.

52
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,354
- Got it here as fast as l could.
- Oh, thanks.

53
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,471
By the way,
your fan is back again.

54
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,194
He's been here every day.

55
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,354
l mean, he's gorgeous.
He can't take his eyes off you.

56
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,436
You want me to find out
what he wants?

57
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,109
- l know what he wants.
- All rise!

58
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,514
Your Honour, might l ask the court
to examine this document, please?

59
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,596
Well, Mr Schiff, what do you
have to say about this?

60
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,032
maintained the taps
until the date of arrest.

61
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,150
- Yes, it appears so.
- Your Honour, on that basis,
l'd like to move...

62
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,475
for a directed verdict
of not guilty.

63
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,955
l have no choice
but to grant the motion.

64
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,311
The defendant is released from custody.
These proceedings are adjourned.

65
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,237
Yes!

66
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,635
Couldn't you have found something
a little more official?

67
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,796
lt's my favourite
Chinese joint.

68
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,673
Not bad for a night school lawyer.
See you next time, Counsellor.

69
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,234
Not necessarily.

70
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,157
Ladies and gentlemen,
first of all l'd like to thank...

71
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,396
my brilliant attorney,
Jennifer Haines.

72
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,590
She knew l was an innocent man.

73
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,759
of American justice.
Thank you very much.

74
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,397
How are you tonight,
Miss Haines?

75
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,351
Very well.

76
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:00,037
ls there anything better than winning?

77
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,913
Hope your day was as good as mine.

78
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,919
- lt was pretty good, in fact.
- Really?

79
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,112
Does this mean
it's time to go home?

80
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,152
You'll never make it
to the parking lot.

81
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,518
- What about the cleaning crew?
- Mmm, they don't get here
'til about midnight.

82
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,198
Should be done with you by then.

83
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,958
You know, sometimes l wonder why
we both even bother to pay rent.

84
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,150
We both have kitchens;
we eat out every night.

85
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,397
We have bedrooms,
but we only sleep in them.

86
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,273
You think there's
something wrong with us?

87
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,472
Think we should be more conventional?
Check into a seedy motel?

88
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,790
l don't have to get up tomorrow.

89
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,275
Well, l do.

90
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,914
Well, our flight to Aspen
isn't 'til 6:00.

91
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,271
Jen, you better get yourself
a good criminal attorney.

92
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,675
- Why?
- Because you're gonna murder me.

93
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,712
- Why?
- Because this damned acquisition...

94
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,229
gets more complicated every day.

95
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,433
- l'll make it up to you.
- l've heard this before.

96
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,519
Hey! You, of all people,
should understand.

97
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,712
l can't help it. lt's work.

98
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,400
So is this relationship.

99
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,716
- Way to go, Jennifer!
- Hey, hey.

100
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,599
Have you seen the morning paper?

101
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,757
Get a load of the picture
on page three.

102
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,953
Hope they didn't catch me with my eyes
closed and my mouth open, as usual.

103
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,517
lt's not you. They claim he threw her
out the window last Friday.

104
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,313
You'd think he'd
still be in mourning.

105
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,510
The police are looking all over
for him, he has the nerve...

106
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,518
to walk into a Superior Court
and watch a trial? Thanks.

107
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,437
Chutzpah.

108
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,755
- Yeah?
- There's a gentleman here
who says you're expecting him.

109
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,031
- A Mr Greenhill?
- So he wasn't just watching the trial.

110
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,311
- He was watching you.
- Tell him l'm in a meeting.
l can't see him.

111
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,553
Didn't anyone ever say
no to you before?

112
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,719
Yes. My wife said no,
just before l threw her out the window.

113
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,918
You find it amusing
being charged with murder?

114
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,396
Of course not. lt did get your
attention though, didn't it?

115
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,157
ls that why you showed up at the
Lombardo trial? To get my attention?

116
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,956
Absolutely.
l want you to defend me.

117
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,957
They tell me you're the best there is,

118
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,389
that you're smart and tough.

119
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,556
Couldn't hazard a guess.

120
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,756
who used to take her
to trials after school...

121
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,549
- Where'd you hear that?
- Uh, some old bailiff
down at the courthouse.

122
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,072
l see the little girl who,
at the ripe age of 14,

123
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,069
jumped up in the middle
of a murder trial and said, ''Objection!''

124
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,111
And the judge took you
back to his chambers...

125
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,789
and you ended up clerking
for that judge ten years later.

126
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,113
And l really delve into
anything that interests me.

127
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,834
Uh-huh. And did this interest
develop before or after...

128
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,872
you threw your wife
out the window?

129
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,714
We need to get
one thing very clear.

130
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,832
l did not murder anybody.

131
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,554
Come on, Counsellor.
You're experienced enough...

132
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,716
to recognize a set-up
when you see one.

133
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,992
- Who set you up?
- My wife.

134
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,110
She throws herself out the window
and makes it look like you did it?

135
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,713
You don't know how crazy
some women can behave.

136
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,638
- l'm sure you do.
- Yes, l do.

137
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,117
l've lived off of women
all my life.

138
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,833
That's all l'm good at.
lt's my talent--

139
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,030
Getting women to do
what l want them to do.

140
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,630
Then you must have
wanted her dead.

141
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,153
l knew she was angry
with me and upset.

142
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,397
Depressed over our relationship.

143
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,909
Now, what could a man do
to get his wife that, that angry?

144
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,317
Miss Haines,

145
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,035
God put too damn many
attractive women on this earth.

146
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,274
Rita knew that about me
before we were married,

147
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,312
and l never promised to change.

148
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,434
You don't portray yourself
as a very sympathetic figure.

149
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,357
There's a hell of a big
difference between...

150
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,029
being a compulsive
womanizer and a murderer.

151
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,515
- Was your wife rich?
- Very.

152
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,915
So you stand to inherit
a great deal of money?

153
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,556
Yes. And l've earned every penny.

154
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,956
Look at what she's
putting me through now.

155
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,514
She could have just divorced you.

156
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,230
Not good enough.

157
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,639
Miss Haines,
my wife was a very sick woman.

158
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,515
Two years ago she had to be
institutionalized for seven months.

159
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,950
Clinical depression.

160
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,551
And she swore that she'd get back at me
even if it meant from the grave.

161
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,750
And now, thanks to her
letter writing skills,

162
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,792
l might just spend the rest
of my life behind bars.

163
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,514
- There was a letter?
- Yes.

164
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:45,634
lt arrived at the State's Attorney's
Office the day after her death.

165
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,194
They wouldn't let me see it,
but they made it pretty clear...

166
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,797
Where did you go?

167
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,756
Do l have to answer that?

168
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:09,116
l promise, nothing you say
could lower my opinion of you.

169
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,474
All right.

170
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,628
l met a very nice lady
at the bar at the Drake.

171
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,753
She had some clean shirts at
her place; so many of them do.

172
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,158
And they always seem to fit.

173
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,273
Terrible picture, don't you think?

174
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,630
Do you know that there
are some women that are...

175
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,311
always attracted
to men the same size?

176
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,034
l'm counting on you to arrange that.

177
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,753
l have someone at the State's Attorney's
Office you can surrender to...

178
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,077
without a lot of media coverage.

179
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,751
- And so you'll handle my defence?
- Oh, thank you, but no.

180
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,035
Why not?
Because you don't like me?

181
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,358
- Or because you do?
- You're not my type.

182
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,358
l wouldn't be
too sure about that.

183
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,388
Come on. Why won't you handle
my defence? l'm innocent.

184
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,709
How would l know that?

185
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,516
Because, Miss Haines,
you can tell about clients...

186
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:46,078
like l can tell
about women, like that.

187
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,919
You know, it's funny.
l actually believe you.

188
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,158
Liars are seldom as blunt
or ridiculous.

189
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,233
Well, then, come on. For every
five Lombardos you represent...

190
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,954
you should take on
at least one innocent man.

191
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:07,313
-Mmm, my calendar's full.
-l can't believe you're turning me down.

192
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,275
l'm sure it's a novel experience,
but you'll get used to it.

193
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,277
l never have.

194
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,395
l'll tell you what.

195
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,631
l'll arrange for Josephine Grimes
to come see you.

196
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,832
She's a capable attorney
with her own firm...

197
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,155
and two grown sons as her partners.

198
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,113
l'm sure she'll be safe with you.

199
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,711
Get me Stanley Helman
in the State's Attorney's Office.

200
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,196
- Well, l'm glad you're not
taking that vacation.
- Well--

201
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,108
We've decided to let you take over
on this Barry Carpenter mess.

202
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,233
uh, he's as innocent as a baby.

203
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,793
Let's hold off on that a minute.

204
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,993
Yesterday l spent ten minutes
in my office with a slick...

205
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,510
but very attractive womanizer
who really needs an attorney.

206
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,392
- Who?
- David Greenhill.

207
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,433
Oh, no. Not that guy who
threw his wife out the window.

208
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,676
- l don't know that he did.
- What did you tell him?

209
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,995
l turned him down,
but l'm having second thoughts.

210
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,556
- Why?
- Because l've never represented
anyone like Greenhill before.

211
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,752
He is completely in love
with himself, manipulative...

212
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,553
and an outrageous flirt.

213
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,671
Uh-huh.

214
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,390
l mean, he is a classic target.

215
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,397
The media is gonna have
a field day with him.

216
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,479
''Gigolo murders society wife.''
''Lady-killer kills lady.''

217
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,591
They are gonna hate him
and try and destroy him.

218
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,676
ls that why you're
tempted to take him on?

219
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,276
- Maybe.
- You're really feeling your oats,
aren't you, Jennifer?

220
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,313
- You said you thought
l could be one of the best.
- Mmm.

221
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,479
You carried me through law school,
kept moving me up in the firm.

222
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,036
You want an honest answer?
l am feeling my oats.

223
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,675
- Good.
- l think l can get him off.

224
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,075
Besides, he makes a very good
case for his own innocence.

225
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,513
- l believe him.
- Well, l can see you're
talking yourself into it.

226
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,552
He should be able to afford
the very best defence, eh?

227
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,673
l thought you'd find
something positive about it.

228
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,711
You actually showed up.

229
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,070
You can't-- You can't imagine
how much better l feel...

230
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,998
- just knowing that you're here.
- Well, don't feel too good.

231
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,712
The State's Attorney's Office
say the lab reports show...

232
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,637
your fingerprints
all over that window.

233
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,593
And the houseboy claims he
cleaned it just the day before.

234
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,393
l-lt was stuck.
Rita deliberately...

235
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,556
got me to open the window
that morning.

236
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,992
Can anybody corroborate that?

237
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,031
lt was after the houseboy went out.

238
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,550
Goddam it. Don't you think
if l was gonna toss my wife
out the fuckin' window,

239
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,037
l'd have the common sense to
wipe my fingerprints off of it?

240
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,515
You don't have to convince me.

241
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:14,433
- Okay.
- Rodriguez! Your defence
counsellor is here.

242
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,269
Here's a copy of the letter she sent
to the State's Attorney's Office.

243
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,671
Beautiful.

244
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,588
According to her, l may as well have
taken an ad out in the Chicago Trib.

245
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,314
Our first problem is gonna be
to get you free on bail,

246
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,115
which is always very difficult
in a capital offence.

247
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,315
Then l guess l got me
an attorney.

248
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,148
Can you post bond?

249
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,113
Well, my wife's family
has tied up all the assets,

250
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,437
but Miriam said that she would
stand for the bond and--

251
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,949
Oh, and she said
she'd pay your fee.

252
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,514
- Miriam?
- Miriam Langford.

253
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,269
She's a dear friend.

254
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,515
You don't mind
if l have friends, do you?

255
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,279
Just don't marry them
'til the trial's over, okay?

256
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,918
Ah, don't worry about that.

257
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,953
l might even fall in love
with somebody else by then.

258
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,469
Your Honour, my client, David Greenhill,
has no prior record...

259
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,672
of any criminal activity,
nor has he any history of violence.

260
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,872
He maintains strong financial
and property ties to the community.

261
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,788
There is no reason to believe there is
any danger he'll flee the jurisdiction.

262
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,879
We respectfully request
bail not be denied.

263
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,151
Your Honour, we're dealing here with a
case of cold-blooded murder for profit.

264
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,670
An act so brutal, so premeditated,
it would lead any civilized person...

265
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,633
to believe the perpetrator would be
a danger to others in the community.

266
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,548
Therefore, it's in
the interest of the people that
David Greenhill be denied bail.

267
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,353
The court sets bail
in the amount of $250,000.

268
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,994
And you will surrender
your passport today. Next.

269
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,990
- Let me get outta here.
- Case number 623394.

270
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,917
Miriam, thank you
so much for everything.

271
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,395
l can't tell you
what this means to me.

272
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,954
You're the only one
that believes l'm innocent.

273
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,231
- What about Miss Haines?
- Oh, God, Miss Haines!

274
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,715
She said she'd defend me
even if l was guilty.

275
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,072
- That's her job, isn't it?
- l don't trust her.

276
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,509
See, people like us, Miriam,
we're-- We're warm people.

277
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,791
But she's a--
She's an attorney!

278
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,279
Don't you talk to her about us.
Don't discuss anything with her.

279
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,076
- Do you understand?
- She's awfully attractive.

280
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,156
Not to me, she's not.

281
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,909
All she cares about is winning.
She's like a goddam machine.

282
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,919
She did get you out of jail.
lt's what you wanted.

283
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,510
No, baby.
This is what l wanted.

284
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,876
- Just to your right, ma'am.
- Thank you.

285
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,791
- Hello. Yes, l'm here
to see Mr Greenhill.
- Oh, yes.

286
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,909
Good morning.
Thanks for coming.

287
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,749
Really nice of you to meet here
instead of at the office.

288
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,474
Must feel good to be home.

289
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,716
lt does kinda.

290
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,795
l'm trying not to think
about that window.

291
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,799
That is what you came to see,
isn't it? That window?

292
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,357
l need to know a little
about your background:

293
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,313
- your family, where you went to school.
- Oh, sure.

294
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,558
l was an army brat, in and out
of one school after another.

295
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,150
My father was an artillery captain.
Sit down, please.

296
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,558
l was an only child
and my mother's whole world.

297
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:26,674
She used to steal money out of
my father's pockets and give it to me.

298
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:31,555
l don't think it mattered
too much when he went away
to Vietnam and never came back.

299
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,388
l know it's probably hard to believe
given my current lifestyle,

300
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,638
but l hardly dated
when l was in high school.

301
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,914
ln fact, l didn't really start going out
until after my mother died.

302
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,315
And then only with older women.

303
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,111
What does that tell ya?

304
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,516
- Have you ever had
psychiatric counselling?
- Once.

305
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,196
Woman psychiatrist.

306
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,629
You can imagine
how that turned out.

307
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,230
Well, at least she didn't
charge me for the sessions.

308
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,515
But you've never
been married before?

309
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,077
Friend of mine once said,
''Never marry a woman for her money.

310
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,953
Get her money without
marrying her.''

311
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:33,596
Hi! This is a surprise.
Do we have plans tonight?

312
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,950
l had a visitor today
at the office.

313
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,550
- Your client dropped by.
- Yeah?

314
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,990
- Which client?
- David Greenhill.

315
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,557
- What?
- Yeah, just marched in
like he owned the joint.

316
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,030
- What in the world did he want?
- Well, he wanted to thank me...

317
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,993
for giving up our trip to Aspen
so that you could defend him,

318
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,159
but since l did hurt my knee
there last year, maybe it was
better that l didn't go.

319
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,794
Now, uh, how the hell
did he know that stuff?

320
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,469
Sweetheart, l have no idea.
l've told him absolutely nothing
about my personal life.

321
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,876
Yeah, well, somebody's
been doin' some talking.

322
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,639
You know, the whole time
he was looking me up and down.

323
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,799
- He was checking me out.
- He does that with everybody.

324
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,799
Oh, yeah?
So how do you rate, Jen?

325
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,629
What are you, a ten? Eleven?

326
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,115
Hasn't he told you yet?

327
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,391
Look, Phil, l don't like what
he did, but you're really--

328
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,956
l don't like your client.
Get rid of him.

329
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,638
- ''Get rid of him''?
- He's a slimy son of a bitch.

330
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,991
He very well may be, but the
question is: ls he a murderer?

331
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,388
He's butting into our lives,
so l say dump him.

332
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,108
You have no right to ask that of me.

333
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,116
by the way,
whom l truly detested?

334
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,357
How many times have l had to
sit with them and dine with them,

335
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,155
listen to their stupid jokes
and smile sweetly 'cause you
had a deal going on with them?

336
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,955
Look, Counsellor, l'm not on the jury,
so save the brilliant summation.

337
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,389
The bottom line: There's nothing
going on with me and this guy.

338
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,193
l'm not attracted to him.
He's not coming on to me.

339
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,640
and l am uncomfortable
in the situation, l will make...

340
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,990
- the appropriate decision then.
- Lawyer talk.

341
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,270
Why do you have to use
that tone of voice...

342
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,873
There's no point talkin', Jennifer.
You always have to win.

343
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,788
David Greenhill did not
start this, you did.

344
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,873
Well, hi there.

345
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,753
- What's so important?
- You dropped in to see...

346
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,834
-Did he say l was rude?
-lt doesn't matter what he said.

347
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,113
you better get yourself
another attorney. You can tell
your Miriam Langford...

348
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,153
to start looking because
l will not be there for you.

349
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,671
Actually, l think
Phil's a hell of a guy.

350
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,597
He's crazy about you.

351
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,039
You know, l'm not remotely
interested in your opinion.

352
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:48,155
Jennifer, l-l can take criticism.

353
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,078
But please try
to understand that l've...

354
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,069
never been accused of a crime
before in my whole life.

355
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,237
l'm completely vulnerable.

356
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,110
Right now,
you-you're my entire world.

357
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,358
l understand that. But if you
ever do that again, l'm walking.

358
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,354
- No, you won't.
- Oh, just watch me.

359
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,790
Please, Jennifer, l--

360
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,956
l don't even have Miriam any more.

361
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,198
lt's finished.
l broke it off myself.

362
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,630
Christ sakes, Jennifer,
Miriam wasn't a stupid woman.

363
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,955
She could see what
was happening between us.

364
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,753
Wha-What was happen--
What did you tell her?

365
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,437
l told her that right now,
that you're the only woman...

366
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,471
in the world that
means anything to me.

367
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,995
- David, are you crazy?
- cut me off and then got on a plane...

368
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,793
and went to Europe,
went to Geneva.

369
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,115
She has a house there.
At least l think that's where she went.

370
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,789
'Course, she's got 50 houses
all over the fuckin' world.

371
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,879
Empty houses with servants
sittin' around on their asses,
waitin' for somebody to show up.

372
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,396
She didn't give a fuck about me! She
just wanted to know that l was there.

373
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,715
David, she was also
paying for your defence.

374
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,956
- You'll get your money,
don't worry about that.
- From who?

375
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,039
You're going to prove me innocent
and then there will be millions.

376
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,629
You know, no matter how bad
it ever got with me and Rita,

377
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,796
at least l knew she had
real feelings for me.

378
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,150
She framed you for her own murder.
l'd say you're not doing that well...

379
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,319
- in the female department.
- Well, l just am not-- Oh, shit!

380
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,399
What am l? Am l some kind
of a fuckin' lowlife...

381
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,909
because l take money
when it's offered to me?

382
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,390
Nobody says a goddam thing.
lt's perfectly fine, isn't it?

383
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,876
Well, you--
lf you wanna talk about...

384
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,434
goddam women as sex objects?
What about--

385
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,710
What about men? What about me?

386
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,150
They use me.
And then they fuckin' drop me...

387
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,999
whenever they damn well please.

388
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,990
l do not intend
to represent you any more.

389
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:32,436
l tried to speak to you rationally, but
you defy all logic, so l'm backing off.

390
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,790
l'm not doing this for him.
l'm doing this because you--

391
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:42,436
You're an impossible person. l don't
have to put up with it and l won't.

392
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,870
No. No, l'm the one
that has to do this.

393
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,672
l'm the one that has to stand trial.

394
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,076
l have to defend myself
and my whole fuckin' lifestyle.

395
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,795
- Sure, go.
- Then step out of my way.

396
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,391
Oh, and Jennifer?
Ah, l mean, Miss Haines.

397
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,799
Really like your hair that way.

398
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,837
Oh, put the lady on.

399
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,835
Mrs Langford. l'm sorry
to be calling you on your vacation,

400
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,919
but our accounting department informs me
that you haven't remitted any payment...

401
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,430
for Mr Greenhill's
recent fees and expenses.

402
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,070
Yeah, Tom. Hi.

403
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,273
Jennifer, uh, l've just hung up
with Mrs Langford in Geneva.

404
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,675
She, uh, not only refuses
any more financial...

405
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:09,157
responsibility
for David Greenhill, uh--

406
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,239
She maintains that the,
the two of you are having an affair.

407
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,354
Tom, l had to go
to his apartment yesterday.

408
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,031
He told me while he was waving
a ten-inch kitchen knife
in front of my face--

409
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:27,233
He told me that l was the only woman
in the world that meant anything to him.

410
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,399
He treats me like we're
intimate. l don't know why,
but he's become fixated on me.

411
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,715
lt's-- lt's scary.

412
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,638
He's your client. You picked him.

413
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,309
l made a mistake.
l really made a mistake.

414
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,672
l'm sorry. Let's dump this guy.
l want off this case.

415
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,870
l want this lunatic out of my life.

416
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,560
- How do we do it?
- So now that the man can't pay,

417
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,955
- suddenly you don't
want any part of him.
- That's not it, Your Honour.

418
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,039
He totally misrepresented his ability
to meet these obligations.

419
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,391
You are associated with one of
the most successful firms in this city.

420
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,478
l don't think it's going to go under
because one client can't pay his bill.

421
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,637
You can always sue for these fees
afterwards and collect in a civil court.

422
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,796
No one's stopping you from that.

423
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,514
Your Honour, he's already
in arrears over 29,000.

424
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,553
- lt's estimat--
- The exact dollar figure
does not concern me.

425
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,148
You took on this man's defence,
filed his plea of not guilty,

426
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,317
went through the pleadings and the
discovery process, and now you want out.

427
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,473
for this entire process to be
repeated with some other attorney?

428
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,194
Why should they foot the bill
because your firm...

429
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,039
didn't obtain an adequate
retainer up front?

430
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,913
This widespread dumping of clients
is an abuse to the entire system.

431
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,600
l intend to see it stopped.

432
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,236
You will provide
the best defence possible.

433
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:46,434
And l'm gonna keep an eye on you
and make sure that you do.

434
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,710
Request denied.

435
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,308
Mr Greenhill.

436
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,830
ln your letter to me you said
you had complete faith in Miss Haines.

437
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,111
Do you still feel Miss Haines
can give you adequate representation?

438
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,993
Yes, l do, Your Honour.

439
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,714
l guess l'll see you in court.

440
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,994
l won't hold this against you.

441
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,553
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

442
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,671
You have some things
for Jennifer Haines,

443
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,792
- uh, 12-C down the street?
- lt was going to be delivered.

444
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,717
Yeah, well, um--

445
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,149
She asked me to run down
and pick 'em up for her.

446
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,637
- Okay.
- Uh, she said...

447
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,955
to just put it on her account?

448
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,033
Very light on the starch,
especially in the collar.

449
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,550
- Okay. l'll remember.
- Thank you.

450
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,399
- Good morning, Rosalie.
- Miss Haines isn't in yet.

451
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,956
Yes, l know, dear. Thank you.

452
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,717
- You look very nice today.
- Good morning, Mr Greenhill.

453
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,071
Hello, Gretchen.
Hello, Virginia.

454
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,634
- Good morning, Mr Greenhill.
- Nice to see you.

455
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,474
- Good morning, Emily.
- You don't have an appointment.

456
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,591
l, l know.
Well, listen, l, uh--

457
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,917
l'm just gonna drop these things off
for Jennifer. She might need them later.

458
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,952
- Should l just put 'em inside?
- Oh, l'll take it.

459
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,152
Oh, okay. Um, and tell Jennifer
l'll just talk to her later.

460
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,874
Ah, she's got
a very busy schedule.

461
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,834
Emily, um, how long have you
worked for Miss Haines?

462
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,110
Well, l'm sure that she
relies on your discretion.

463
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,913
And so do l.

464
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,192
l behaved badly the other day.
l'm sorry.

465
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,154
Look, as soon as you're free, l want us
to go off for a couple of weeks...

466
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,794
and we won't tell anybody
where we're going.

467
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,514
There's a little detail
of earning money for the firm.

468
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,316
No, no, no. They can hardly refuse
to let a girl go on her honeymoon.

469
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,630
Will you marry me?

470
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,274
l guess you do.

471
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,069
l could swear that l know you.
Do you work around Watertower?

472
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,517
Women take care of me.

473
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,832
Mm-mm. l already have one.

474
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,030
But you can pay for it.

475
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,630
Bartender? This one's on her.

476
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:03,435
-Jennifer, l need to speak to you alone.
-What the hell do you want?

477
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,348
Jennifer, l know l've said
some things that l shouldn't,
but please don't treat me this way.

478
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,471
- l-lt's not right.
- Look, just ignore him.

479
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,309
This is some very weird thing
he's doing, just like leaving
my clothes at my office.

480
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,637
- What are you talkin' about?
- She didn't tell you?

481
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:21,311
You-You didn't tell him about the
personal items you left at my apartment?

482
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,113
- Look, maybe you should
just talk to the man.
- l don't want to talk to him.

483
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,438
- l do not want him in my personal life.
- All right, you heard her.

484
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,519
You know, it's supposed to
be unethical when a doctor...

485
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,269
or a psychiatrist
seduces their patients.

486
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,153
- But what about when a lawyer does it?
- That's bullshit!

487
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,951
Maybe l know her a little
better than you do, Phil.

488
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,640
-You better get the fuck outta my sight.
-Don't hit him.

489
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,354
That's what he wants.

490
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,357
Jennifer.

491
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,233
This is the monster client syndrome
every lawyer dreads.

492
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,635
Why would he make all that garbage up?

493
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,228
- He's brilliant at finding out
people's weak spots.
- Oh.

494
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,716
Our relationship is your weak spot?

495
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,956
You said that, l didn't.

496
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,196
- Thank you.
- Just drop me off at home, okay?

497
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,515
Whatever you want.

498
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,434
- Hello, Phil?
- Oh, dear.

499
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,028
You're all by yourself.

500
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,711
Why are you doing this?

501
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:37,391
'Cause if you loved me,
you'd do a better job defending me.

502
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,552
This is like saying ''fuck you''
to your brain surgeon the night
before the operation.

503
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,434
For a limited time only you can receive
this entire box set for only 9.99.

504
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,552
l'm not worried.
l'll see you tomorrow at 10:45.

505
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,353
- What?
- Check your calendar, honey.

506
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,597
We have a scheduled conference
tomorrow at 10:45.

507
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,030
Or should l get word to Judge Tompkins
that you're refusing to see me?

508
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,277
- 10:45.
- Nighty-night.

509
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,436
l'll be with you in a minute.

510
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,232
Let's go over the events
of the afternoon of your wife's death.

511
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,113
You left the apartment
at 20 after 12:00.

512
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,391
The lobby doorman saw you exit
the elevator and go out.

513
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,990
Yeah, isn't that great
he remembered?

514
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,398
You then walked to this
Four Farthings Bar...

515
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,034
on Dickens Street
where you met a woman.

516
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,232
Would you care to tell me
her name and address now?

517
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,396
Counsellor, how would
that sound in court?

518
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,796
While his beloved wife was tossing
herself out the fuckin' window,

519
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,754
our hero was down at the local
bar gettin' his rocks off.

520
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,269
Let's just say l took
a long walk, shall we?

521
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,196
There wasn't any woman,
was there?

522
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,117
- Well, there could have been.
- But there wasn't.

523
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,391
Yes, but there could have been.

524
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,910
l've met a lot of nice ladies
in that particular bar.

525
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,271
- But not on that day?
- Let me ask you something, Counsellor.

526
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,828
But then l haven't
butchered 12 or 14 people.

527
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,155
'Course he's a pro, so l guess
that makes the difference.

528
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,558
Uh, that doesn't
bother you so much.

529
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,911
You're not giving me
very much to work with.

530
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,634
Well, you got them to believe
that Frank Hillman slept right
through the murders...

531
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,389
in his own house
of his wife and both the kids.

532
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,308
l proved, that from his bedroom,

533
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,434
he would not have been able
to hear the screams in the basement.

534
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,994
Yes, l know.
l was there that day.

535
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,234
Oh, yes. Quite a few times.

536
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,989
ln fact,
sometimes it was hard to get in.

537
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,874
ls that when you started thinking
about killing your wife?

538
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,479
Now that you mention it.

539
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,389
Wait a minute. Now, was that
a proper question for you to ask?

540
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:52,439
By law, l'm forbidden to repeat anything
you tell me in confidence.

541
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,439
But l'm certain you knew that.

542
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,233
Could you explain that to me?
l'm not quite sure how that works.

543
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,749
Oh, l think you are.

544
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,395
Privileged communication
between attorney and client.

545
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,275
Mm-hmm. So, you couldn't
be forced to tell,

546
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,076
- but you could leak something.
- Only at the risk of being disbarred.

547
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,395
l would lose my licence
to practice...

548
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,399
and the facts wouldn't be
admissible in court.

549
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,159
Now, does that pertain
to just the current crime...

550
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,670
that l am charged with
or would that include...

551
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,433
Other murders?

552
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,869
lt's getting very interesting.

553
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,631
The law is very clear on this.

554
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:06,118
Only the details of any future
crime that was being planned...

555
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,431
l would have to reveal.

556
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,916
Anything that had already happened...

557
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,998
comes under the protection
of privilege.

558
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:26,758
You know what the problem is
with committing perfect murders?

559
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:36,318
- What?
- You can't tell anybody about them.

560
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,349
Were they all women, David?

561
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,149
Now don't get optimistic.

562
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,193
l hardly qualify as a serial killer.

563
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,153
l never got any pleasure
out of the actual act.

564
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,230
lt was more the, the planning
and the covering up...

565
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:17,114
that was the most rewarding.

566
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,552
You spent the money very quickly
and you needed more.

567
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,389
lt's never difficult to find.

568
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,830
Did you know that there's
a certain breed of women...

569
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,715
that always seem
to seek out men like me?

570
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:40,118
They think that their money
puts them in control.

571
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,677
And for a while,
l go along with it.

572
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,908
But you'd never been
arrested before?

573
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,510
Questioned once or twice,
but never detained.

574
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,394
Back in New York?

575
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,637
l never said l lived in New York.

576
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,309
But somewhere on,
on the East coast.

577
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,993
Emily. Just in the nick of time.

578
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,556
l was about to spill my guts
all over this table.

579
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,359
Would you like me to send out
for some sandwiches?

580
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,512
Uh-- Uh, no. No, thank you.

581
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,111
Uh, uh, l think
we're about finished.

582
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:33,313
So, w-we'll meet again
on, on Friday.

583
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,116
- At 10:00.
- Yes, Friday at 10:00.

584
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,796
l'll bet you can hardly wait.

585
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,831
A-And David,
don't call me at home.

586
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,077
Oh, you won't hear
from me until Friday.

587
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,994
Emily. You've lost
a couple of pounds.

588
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,793
Keep up the good work.

589
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,315
- Hello.
- Moe, l need to see you right away.

590
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,908
He's toying with you.

591
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:18,433
lf he can prove it, that's,
that's something else.

592
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,599
l just had a feeling it had
to be New York or Boston...

593
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,473
or Philadelphia;
some major city on the East coast...

594
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:30,355
where wealthy women congregate.

595
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,153
He said he'd been
picked up and questioned.

596
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,191
Well, that's a definite plus.

597
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,915
He might have been operating
under a different name.

598
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,033
Maybe not.
This boy loves to take chances.

599
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,436
l need you to help me, Moe.

600
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,391
Whatever.

601
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:52,115
l need you find out every
single thing you can about him.

602
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,391
You can't turn him in unless you
wanna kiss your career goodbye.

603
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,117
Why is--

604
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,874
Why is he inventing things about me?

605
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,039
Why is he loading me up with information
that could potentially harm him?

606
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,276
Moe, he had this whole thing
worked out in advance.

607
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,790
He chose me to defend him
before he killed his wife.

608
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,717
What if he--

609
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,357
What if he decides it's
too risky for me to be alive?

610
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,432
Thank you! Thank you,
thank you so much!

611
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,592
Trevor-Norton, eh?

612
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,558
We can work that one out.

613
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,592
No, l can't.
l'll be in, uh, court next week.

614
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,549
Yeah, Trevor-Norton.
Custom-made shoes in London.

615
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,477
But they went out
of business two years ago.

616
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,309
- Do you think you can
trace him back through them?
- Well, l got other leads.

617
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,715
Has his shirts made in Hong Kong.

618
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,637
Here, let me do that.

619
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,909
- l'll take you to the airport, okay?
- Ah, good. Yeah.

620
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,999
And the deceased, Mrs Greenhill, visited
you at the 101st Detective Division...

621
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,997
exactly one week
before her death. ls that right?

622
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,510
- She did.
- Will you tell us
the substance of that meeting?

623
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,871
She told me she was desperately afraid
her husband intended to kill her.

624
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,072
Did you speak to Mrs Greenhill
subsequent to that first meeting?

625
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,512
Yeah, l, uh, telephoned her five days
later to make sure she was all right.

626
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,438
She said she was living in
a constant state of terror,

627
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,755
locking her bedroom door at night.

628
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,873
So l urged her to move
into a hotel, contact her lawyer.

629
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,710
Uh, there was no action that
the police could have taken
under the circumstances.

630
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,877
Unfortunately, no crime
had been committed.

631
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,831
Your witness.

632
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,311
Lieutenant Martinez,

633
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,149
do you feel guilty now about
not having taken action?

634
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,511
Why should l?
l went by the book.

635
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,518
l don't see how
l could have prevented it.

636
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,555
You didn't believe her, did you?

637
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:02,435
l thought she was maybe making trouble
for her husband. l don't know.

638
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:07,395
Well, Mr Greenhill sent me to this,
uh, uniform store on Grant Street...

639
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,351
to, uh, to get outfitted.

640
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,996
He, uh, he said he was tired of seeing
me in the same uniforms every day.

641
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,270
Did he tell you
what time to be back?

642
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,632
No, actually he said
there was no need to hurry.

643
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,878
And in less than one hour after you left
Mrs Greenhill alone with her husband,

644
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,798
she plunged to her death
from the 18th floor window.

645
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,151
- Objection. Leading.
- Withdrawn. No more questions.

646
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:38,914
Mr Loo, you were with
the deceased for over a year
before she married David Greenhill.

647
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,917
- ls that right?
- Right.

648
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,192
And during that time, who gave
you your orders and instructions
around the house?

649
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,151
Mrs Greenhill did, of course.

650
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,874
So it may very well have been
Rita Greenhill's idea...

651
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,037
that you leave early
that day for the fitting.

652
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,118
Well, it could have been.

653
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,277
Now, you saw the defendant get off
the elevator and cross the lobby.

654
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,753
- ls that right?
- Yes.

655
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,599
Did he give you any
special instructions?

656
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:09,238
He said his wife was sleeping late
and under no circumstances
should she be disturbed.

657
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:13,478
Did you actually see
Mr Greenhill exit into the street?

658
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,397
You know, l'm not sure.

659
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,911
But you are certain he couldn't have
reentered the elevator and gone back up.

660
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,157
Suppose he slipped around to
the far corner of the lobby and
took the service elevator up.

661
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,034
- Would you have seen that?
- Well, l wouldn't have seen that.

662
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,230
Your witness.

663
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:43,310
Well, he had an overcoat on.
lt-- lt was chilly outside.

664
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,319
l think he had on gloves.

665
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,796
- Excuse me?
- He had on gloves.

666
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:57,438
He always dressed real smart,
Mr Greenhill. Just like today. Real G.Q.

667
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,635
- We've seen the suit,
Mr Greenhill. Sit down.
- Uh, sorry.

668
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,797
Mr Nolan, are you certain
he had on gloves?

669
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,115
his fingerprints all over
would put on gloves afterwards?

670
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,232
- Hardly a question, Your Honour.
- Out of line, Miss Haines,
and you know it.

671
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,191
The jury will disregard
Miss Haines' comments.

672
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:24,758
- What was going on
in the lobby that day?
- Same as every day.

673
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:33,238
- Only in the lobby?
- No.

674
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:40,630
- Could you be more specific?
- Well, at that particular time,

675
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:44,116
they were sandblasting
from 11 through 9.

676
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,471
On eight, they were knocking out walls,
combining apartments.

677
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,355
- How were they getting there?
- Service elevator, service stairs.

678
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,673
- l don't see how.
- And to your knowledge,

679
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:11,999
did the police question each
and every one of those painters
and plasterers and plumbers...

680
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,680
to find out whether or not
they had seen David Greenhill?

681
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:19,157
-Objection.
-Withdrawn. l have no further questions.

682
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,510
We will adjourn
until 9:30 tomorrow morning.

683
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,349
Well, l think that made
a few points with the jury.

684
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,552
You seem surprised
l'm doing a decent job.

685
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,193
Hello, Esther.

686
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,880
Say hello to Jennifer Haines.
Jennifer, this is my friend, Esther.

687
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,753
Well, you're every bit as attraactive
as David said you were

688
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,677
I'm sure he's never
stopped talking about me.

689
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:53,392
- Surprise.
- I hope this brings us up-to-date.

690
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:58,275
[ Skipped item nr. 690 ]

691
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,789
You could have paid
your bills from the start

692
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,358
I would have paid up on the spot.

693
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,797
Would you care to join us for dinner ?

694
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,310
[ Skipped item nr. 694 ]

695
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:24,319
No, uh, thank you.
l have to prepare for tomorrow.

696
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:29,389
See, l just sit here and look pretty
and she does all the work.

697
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:33,195
He's very lucky
to have you on his side.

698
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,397
Moe, l can hardly hear you.

699
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,876
l'm at the Baltimore Airport
just boarding a plane to Boston.

700
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,596
Thanks to our friendly London
shoe company, l picked up
quite a trail on Greenhill.

701
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:57,235
He lived here in Maryland
for eight months. Before that,
in Boston under the name of...

702
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,157
Edgar Greenhill.

703
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,157
- lsn't that his middle name?
- Yeah.

704
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,840
Listen, there's a--
There's a woman here, Selma Hanks,

705
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:08,549
who died here after
she overdosed on sleeping pills.

706
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:12,275
And another woman in Boston, who, uh,
well, she's on life-support systems...

707
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,039
after she O.D.'d on something.

708
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,754
And they're both
former lady friends of his.

709
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,755
He fixates on a woman and then--

710
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,752
He won't hurt you now. He needs you.

711
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,838
But, Moe,
he's planning something.

712
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:47,352
Now, look, Jen, you--
You be careful of this guy.

713
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:52,270
Moe, he had to have been
able to get back upstairs...

714
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,712
to kill his wife
with no one seeing him.

715
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,989
Oh, what did l do right?

716
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:20,078
Oh, l didn't feel
like being alone tonight.

717
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,509
That bastard.
He's really starting to get to you.

718
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,876
How can l help you?

719
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,430
You can't.

720
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,678
Thank you.

721
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,872
Oh, good morning. l want you to
know how l loved being in court.

722
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,391
You did very well.

723
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,797
Excuse me.

724
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,717
- Morning, Emily.
- Hi, Jennifer.

725
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:00,389
Good morning, Counsellor.
Did we oversleep this morning a little?

726
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,790
And State's Attorney Heath,
is this the original...

727
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:08,151
of the document
you received in the mail?

728
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:11,670
-lt is.
-May we mark this Prosecution Exhibit C?

729
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,360
And would you read the contents
into the record, please?

730
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,517
''lt's after 12:00 now.

731
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,552
''He's arranged to be alone
with me in the apartment.

732
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,240
''l am not strong enough
to run away.

733
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:30,069
''l have given up all hope
or reason to fight back.

734
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:34,910
But if David succeeds, l pray
he will not go unpunished.''

735
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,077
And it's signed,
''Rita Elizabeth Greenhill.''

736
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,077
What did you do after that, sir?

737
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,794
- We sent it to the Criminal
lnvestigation Division...
- Something bothering you today?

738
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,070
-of the State Attorney's Office.
-Sure. The expression...

739
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,111
- on the jury.
- And they, in turn,
sent it to be authenticated.

740
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:51,199
-And it was therefore verified--
-Don't worry about it.
Diangelo just shot his load.

741
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,914
That letter's all he's got.

742
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,036
One painter's cap.

743
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:06,351
One dust mask filter.

744
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,597
And one pair of work gloves.

745
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,553
- That is 54.19.
- Okay.

746
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,159
- ls that cash or charge?
- Cash, please.

747
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,429
Okay.

748
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,310
Good morning, Mr Loo.
l thought Mr Greenhill and l...

749
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,715
could, uh, ride
downtown together.

750
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,149
Oh, Mr Greenhill
wasn't here last night.

751
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,271
But he asked me to put out
his clothes...

752
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,915
because he might want to change
before going to court.

753
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,998
- Uh, do you mind if l wait?
- Oh, no, please, feel free.

754
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,917
Care for coffee? l have some made.

755
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,430
- Uh, uh, l prefer tea.
- Of course.

756
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,357
Thank you.

757
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,079
What are you doing?

758
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,949
Quite a responsibility
taking care of all this.

759
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:57,676
Oh, yes, indeed. Well, Mr Greenhill
is not so, uh, demanding to work for...

760
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:00,268
now that Mrs Greenhill is gone.

761
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,359
She, uh, she never gave
a person a minute's peace.

762
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,950
- Tea, right?
- Um, actually, no, l'm late.

763
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:11,755
Would you tell Mr Greenhill
l'll meet him at court? Thank you.

764
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,634
Well, this is a surprise.

765
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,829
Great, we'll split a cab.

766
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,633
- Don't you need to change?
- Don't l look all right?

767
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,717
Excuse me.

768
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:54,031
The way you were looking at me,
l thought there was somethin' wrong.

769
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:57,197
A little 5:00 shadow, perhaps, but...

770
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:00,835
nothing that would turn the jury
against me, do you think?

771
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:12,036
You know, for the life of me, l can't
figure out who sent that damn thing.

772
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:16,233
- What?
- The letter, Jennifer.

773
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:19,557
l mean, they say it was sent
on the same day that Rita died.

774
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,194
But Rita never left
the apartment that day.

775
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:26,552
And the mail chute upstairs has been
out of use since the renovations began.

776
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:30,150
Well, you certainly wouldn't
mail any letter to the State's
Attorney's Office yourself.

777
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:32,077
Of course not.

778
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:36,751
Suppose the greedy nephew, uh,
sent it or one of the cousins.

779
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,634
They certainly know
what her signature looks like.
They've seen it on enough cheques.

780
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,753
Could l see a photostat
of the envelope?

781
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,117
Sure. Somebody ought
to be able to figure out...

782
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:07,630
which branch of the post office
this was processed at.

783
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,190
You will follow up on that.

784
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,117
Of course.

785
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:20,275
According to the postmark,
this letter was picked up somewhere...

786
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:28,035
Since there was an earlier
pickup at 2:00, the letter
had to have been mailed...

787
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:34,517
- Objection. Argumentative.
- Rephrase, Miss Haines, rephrase.

788
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:39,794
By making an even greater enlargement
l was able to make a closer examination.

789
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,310
The-- The loops and
the angle of the letters...

790
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,432
now convince me
it is clearly a fake.

791
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:49,472
l apologize to the court.

792
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:52,029
Will counsel approach the bench?

793
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:01,109
What do you have to say
about this, Mr Diangelo?

794
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:04,312
Well, we've had our own people
examine the signature again,

795
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,510
and they now tend to agree.

796
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,871
We'll stipulate
it's not her handwriting.

797
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,038
Winning.
l'm talking about...

798
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:28,038
nailing that fucking Greenhill to
the wall and his lawyer along with him.

799
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,435
Well, after that fiasco with
the forged letter, l would like that.

800
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:33,597
l got a phone call from one
of his girlfriends yesterday.

801
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,358
- She might have been in on it with him.
- She tipped us where to look:

802
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,358
behind the radiator in the basement
of Greenhill's own building.

803
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,516
We got the search warrant.
Pay dirt.

804
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:50,111
All the reports are back from the lab.
And there's no question.

805
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:54,074
David Greenhill
was wearing this stuff.

806
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,636
You're already under oath,
Lieutenant.

807
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:00,194
- Why are they recalling him?
- l have no idea.

808
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,390
Detective Martinez, would you go
to the exhibits table, please,

809
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:15,397
Some coveralls that used
to be white at one time.

810
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:20,191
A pair of work gloves.

811
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:24,359
A cap similar to that used
by a painter or plasterer.

812
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,912
A gauze face mask used
to filter out dust and debris.

813
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:33,238
May we admit these as Prosecution
Exhibits D, E, F and G?

814
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:36,796
And upon obtaining a warrant,
Lieutenant, did you search
Mr Greenhill's apartment,

815
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,876
and did you find
something of interest?

816
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,117
Yes. A pair of
Trevor-Norton shoes...

817
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:46,392
with the residue of plaster and
paint on the soles of the shoes.

818
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:50,957
Mark those Prosecution Exhibit H.
Where were the shoes found?

819
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,876
- Did you make an analysis
of the plaster?
- We did.

820
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,797
- And what did you find?
- Are those your shoes?

821
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:03,549
lt was similar in every way
to the plaster and other
construction materials being...

822
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,595
- No.
- No more questions.

823
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,517
Let him get it all out.

824
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,949
We tested the inside of the cap
for traces of human hair.

825
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,958
Did you compare your findings
to samples of David Greenhill's hair?

826
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:22,834
Objection. Prosecution made no request
for specimens of David Greenhill's hair!

827
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,394
With all due respect,
Your Honour. We didn't need to.

828
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,432
The investigating officer
found a comb and a brush
belonging to the defendant...

829
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,357
and we took the specimen
hairs from that.

830
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:34,155
The specimens seemed to have been
acquired under a legal warrant.
l suggest we continue.

831
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:38,035
Did you do similar tests
on the gauze mask?

832
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,957
We found minuscule particles
of human blood...

833
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,594
such as might be left if
the wearer had recently shaved.

834
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,514
The University of Chicago
prepared these charts.

835
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:52,713
Entered as Exhibits l
and J for the Prosecution.
Will you explain the chart, please?

836
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:56,515
The skin sample matches exactly
the defendant's DNA patterns.

837
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,677
- Did you put the gloves
through your spectrograph?
- Examination of the lining...

838
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:03,156
of the gloves showed traces
of an over-the-counter cleaning
product called Windex Spray.

839
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:05,271
ldentical to the solvent
present on the window...

840
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,436
through which Mrs Greenhill
was thrown to her death.

841
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,199
- Objection, Your Honour!
- Sustained.

842
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:18,115
We'll take lunch now.

843
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:21,437
- Go have lunch.
- We have to talk.

844
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:23,516
You heard me.

845
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,516
l brought you a sandwich.

846
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:06,074
Oh, how thoughtful.

847
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:09,317
Based on what's happened,
do you care to change your plea?

848
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:14,396
l'll sleep on it.

849
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:28,151
- What is it?
- Hello, David. Do you know who this is?

850
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,357
Yes. How are things in Boston?

851
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:37,314
There's been someone around asking
questions about you the last few days.

852
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,238
Of course,
l didn't tell him anything.

853
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,990
An older man?

854
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:47,908
Seventy? Wears a hat?

855
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,674
Looks like you're going
to lose this one. Thank God.

856
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:58,872
Let's celebrate.
Call me when you get in.

857
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,833
l'll be home.

858
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,076
l love you, Jennifer.

859
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:58,712
- Jen.
- l'm right here, sweetheart.

860
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:02,719
- l'm right here.
- l couldn't see--

861
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:05,274
l couldn't see who.

862
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:26,357
This is David's way
of saying he knows.

863
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:58,232
Ooh! l'm sorry.

864
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:01,750
- Who were you expecting?
- You know who.

865
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:04,758
How is he?
ls he gonna be all right?

866
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,677
Yeah.

867
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,870
Can you leave now?

868
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:15,875
There's somethin' at the office.
l gotta show it to ya. lt's important.

869
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:24,078
Ya see, it's a clear pattern
but not conclusive proof.

870
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,395
Nothing to make
a prima facie case.

871
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,909
Well, they sure know
where to look.

872
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:32,476
Well, you divulge any of
those facts and he goes on trial
for any of the other crimes,

873
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:35,433
they'll throw the cases right out
for violation of confidentiality.

874
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:40,634
l can't turn him in either,
because, well, l'm employed by you.

875
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:44,878
- Jury's gotta convict now.
- Well, ya never know.

876
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,958
But as long as that bastard's
out on bail, you--

877
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,514
You watch your step.

878
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:57,195
l've made my decision.

879
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:01,113
We'll stick with
the not guilty plea.

880
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,196
That's your call.

881
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:08,190
Yeah, l didn't want
to do this, but...

882
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,436
now l have no choice.

883
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:18,512
Mrs Bigelow, say hello
to my attorney, Jennifer Haines.

884
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:23,794
- How do you do?
- Say hello to Mrs Bigelow.

885
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:27,708
How is Mrs Bigelow
gonna help us?

886
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:34,395
Well, her husband isn't
going to like this, but, uh,

887
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:38,115
well, Kathleen, why don't
you tell Miss Haines...

888
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:41,915
where l was on the afternoon
of my wife's death?

889
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:49,036
At my place, just around the
corner from his own apartment.

890
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,435
A five-minute walk.

891
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:55,792
Naturally l didn't say
anything about it before...

892
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,559
because Kathleen's marriage
was at stake.

893
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:02,753
And l didn't think there was
much of a case against me.

894
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,269
David was still there when we heard
the police and the ambulance sirens.

895
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:08,472
He couldn't possibly have had
anything to do with it.

896
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:11,512
And, tell Miss Haines what
we were doing the week before.

897
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:19,992
Yes. Um, my eldest daughter
is moving back in with me,
so l've been doing some redecorating.

898
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:23,430
Slapping on some paint,
putting up some wallpaper, and, uh,

899
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:26,233
l got David to pitch in and help.

900
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:29,352
Shamed him into it, actually,
just so he couldn't turn me down--

901
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:32,597
You got him the proper
clothing to wear?

902
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:36,508
You got him a cap and gloves?

903
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,119
The painters had left
some things behind when...

904
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:40,390
they did the upper floor
of the duplex last year.

905
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:43,557
Mrs Bigelow, you realize
l am obligated...

906
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:46,752
not to present perjured
testimony to the court?

907
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:52,318
Excuse me, Jennifer, how can
you be so sure that Kathleen's
not telling the truth?

908
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:59,914
You must know the State's
Attorney's Office will attempt
to impeach this testimony.

909
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:03,396
Lady, my husband is a lineman
with the Chicago Bears.

910
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:07,559
Do you honestly think l'd
jeopardize myself for a lie?

911
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:10,353
This is a very difficult thing
for me to do,

912
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,869
but David's life is in danger.

913
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,473
All right,
l'll put her on the stand.

914
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,875
Anything else you've been holding back?

915
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:31,033
Don't let her attitude bother ya.

916
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:33,071
She's just a little bit jealous.

917
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,919
You see, she wanted
to be the one to save me.

918
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:38,395
And now you've stolen
all of her thunder.

919
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:45,557
You don't have any idea
how those work clothes found
their way into the basement...

920
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,877
of David Greenhill's apartment building,
stuffed behind a radiator out of sight?

921
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,389
To the best of my recollection,
l put them in the trash room,

922
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,671
along with a lot of other junk
when we finished redecorating.

923
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,756
And, of course,
some of the service people...

924
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,677
work in more than one building
in the neighbourhood.

925
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,595
Move that the answer be stricken
as sheer speculation.

926
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:06,599
You asked for, quote, unquote,
''any idea,'' Counsellor.
The answer will stand.

927
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:10,790
for many months while carrying
on an affair with the defendant.

928
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:20,350
l wouldn't lie under oath, and l
certainly wouldn't protect a murderer.

929
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:28,712
On the one hand,
we have overwhelming...

930
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:32,389
physical and forensic evidence
that tells us exactly...

931
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,996
how cleverly it was planned:

932
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:41,636
the change of clothes, the split-second
timing, the cold-blooded brutality.

933
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:47,229
On the other hand, we have
the word of a solitary witness,

934
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,272
a sexual partner
obsessed with the defendant,

935
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,469
l ask you not to allow this man
to escape justice.

936
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:09,830
even when she pleaded for help.

937
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,474
Let's not fail her again this time.

938
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:17,075
Ask yourselves who--

939
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:21,432
Who would have benefited most
from the conviction of David Greenhill?

940
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:27,319
Did we not show numerous relatives...

941
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:30,273
who stood to gain financially
were he found guilty?

942
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:33,949
Did we not prove conclusively
that Rita Greenhill never wrote...

943
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,275
the supposedly incriminating letter?

944
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,231
Eyewitnesses saw--

945
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:50,231
leave the building long before
his wife plunged to her death.

946
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,874
Another witness has testified
to his whereabouts...

947
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,834
at the very time
of his wife's suicide.

948
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:14,874
You've done better.

949
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:21,470
Who knew the jury
would be out for a week?

950
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:25,639
lf they acquit, he's gonna go out and
kill somebody else, some other woman.

951
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,629
Well, let's see what
they have to say. Come on.

952
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:52,395
Aren't you going to hold my hand?

953
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:56,669
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

954
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:04,513
l'm sorry, Your Honour, l have to report
that we're hopelessly deadlocked.

955
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:08,030
You don't see any possibility
of reaching a verdict?

956
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:11,072
We've been in there six days
and we're not even close.

957
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,919
l think it's hopeless, Your Honour.

958
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:17,032
l could send you back
for further deliberation.

959
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:19,515
The way we're divided, it wouldn't
make much difference, Your Honour.

960
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:21,517
Do the other members
of the jury agree?

961
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:31,392
Prosecution will move to retry
with all dispatch and ask the
court to set a new trial date.

962
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,751
l'll take that under advisement.
l will hear motions tomorrow morning.

963
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,356
Thank you so much. Thank you.
l appreciate it. l really am grateful.

964
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:49,948
Thank you. Thank you--

965
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:53,470
Can't win 'em all.
Thank you very much.

966
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,397
- Hey, honey.
- Thank you.

967
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:06,955
Well, if there's a next time,
l guess l can't depend on you.

968
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,469
l'm sure you'll find
somebody wonderful.

969
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:22,396
l'll, uh, be outside.

970
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,428
You know, l feel cheated.

971
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:44,115
l never got a chance
to take the stand.

972
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:51,870
l swear to tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth...

973
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,594
so help me God.

974
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,789
Well, aren't you a little curious?

975
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:13,192
You seem anxious
to tell me all about it.

976
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:26,875
When did you first
decide to murder your wife?

977
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,719
l hadn't really made up my mind...

978
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,910
cinched it for me.

979
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:46,998
What did you see?

980
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,519
You.

981
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:02,109
You were celebrating a victory.

982
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:05,312
Of course, l'd seen your picture
in the newspaper.

983
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:10,033
But when l saw you in person,

984
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:13,311
up close,

985
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:18,434
l realized that this was something
that we had to do together.

986
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:24,588
l'd kill her,
and you'd defend me.

987
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,870
So l started to learn
everything l could about you.

988
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:36,795
l even arranged a,
a visit to Taos, New Mexico,

989
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:39,957
the same week
you took your vacation.

990
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:43,709
l booked myself
into the Summit Lodge,

991
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,991
and l took the adjoining room
on the third floor,

992
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:50,317
right next to yours.

993
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:53,079
Why are you telling me this now?

994
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:57,357
Jenny.

995
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,953
Everybody knows we're lovers.

996
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:06,952
They just don't know
how long it's been going on...

997
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:10,914
or how long we'd been
planning the murder together.

998
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:16,198
l even sent you a gift.

999
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:20,836
l charged it on my credit card
and had it delivered to your room.

1000
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:23,474
l'm sure the shopkeeper
has a record.

1001
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,751
- The turquoise bracelet?
- Mm-hmm.

1002
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:31,235
- lt was you.
- Did you like it?

1003
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:37,350
Can you imagine
how that would look...

1004
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:40,199
should you ever decide to
violate your vow of silence...

1005
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:43,790
about this murder
or any other murders?

1006
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,634
You sent that letter.

1007
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,390
We just played out our parts.

1008
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:08,433
l could make you handle
my defence if l wanted to.

1009
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:15,436
But frankly,
l'm beginning to tire of you.

1010
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:18,836
You're not nearly as tough
or as smart as l thought you were.

1011
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:31,513
Witness may step down.

1012
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:39,392
Or l could sue
your firm for malpractice...

1013
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:42,432
and collect a goddam fortune...

1014
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:47,190
over that stupid,
phoney evidence you planted.

1015
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:50,835
Lawyer tries to frame
her own client, film at 11:00.

1016
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:54,995
Honey, you would be
finished forever.

1017
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,355
Why don't you just do it?

1018
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:10,229
Because we've been close,
haven't we, Jennifer?

1019
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:17,391
Closer than most people who fuck.

1020
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,950
Why?

1021
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:30,634
Why did you take the gloves off...

1022
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:32,637
before you killed her?

1023
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:42,756
Killing with gloves on would
be like fucking with a rubber.

1024
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:59,239
Bye, Jennifer.

1025
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,157
Good luck.

1026
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:09,711
What'd he do?

1027
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:23,878
You haven't said a word
since we left the courtroom.

1028
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:27,557
What did that bastard say to you?

1029
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,397
Moe, l've--

1030
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:41,470
l've looked into the face
of somebody so evil.

1031
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:44,194
l've heard words so vile.

1032
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:50,635
Moe, l've gotta destroy him.

1033
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:55,515
-What are you talkin' about?
-All that evidence you gathered:

1034
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:58,950
Selma Hanks,

1035
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:01,071
the woman on life support,
where is it?

1036
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:05,434
Right here.

1037
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:08,313
- Have you got a copier?
- No.

1038
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:12,795
Hold onto that file.

1039
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:16,435
l'm going down to the State's
Attorney's Office tomorrow.

1040
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:21,190
l'm gonna tell them everything
l know about David Greenhill.

1041
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:23,038
lt would never be admissible.

1042
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:25,435
All they'd need is corroborating
evidence of their own.

1043
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:28,836
Are you nuts? lf something
like that ever got out,

1044
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:31,633
it could mean disbarment,
the end of your career.

1045
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:35,719
l don't care
if it means l'm indicted.

1046
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:38,354
He made me an accomplice, Moe.

1047
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:46,833
And l'm not gonna
let him keep walking the streets
looking for another vulnerable,

1048
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:49,076
helpless woman to kill.

1049
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:52,829
And he will, Moe, he will.

1050
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,315
Now, look, Jennifer,

1051
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:58,034
l've known you all your life.

1052
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:01,152
You'd be giving up everything
you ever cared for.

1053
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:06,833
lt's worth it.

1054
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:09,428
lt's worth it, Moe.

1055
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:11,869
All right now, please.

1056
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,310
Huh? Just think about it.

1057
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:19,069
l've been thinking about it ever
since we left the courtroom.

1058
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:26,554
He is going down, Moe.

1059
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:29,717
He is going down.

1060
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:35,237
Are you going to be
all right tonight?

1061
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:39,478
l'm picking Phil up
at his office at 10:00.
l'll pull myself together by then.

1062
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,716
ls he back to work already?

1063
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:44,195
The doctors felt his job
would be the best therapy.

1064
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:47,517
No, you're the best therapy.

1065
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:50,313
Why don't you marry the poor bastard?

1066
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:54,997
Thanks, Moe.

1067
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:22,432
Well, what can l do for you?

1068
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,791
Well, l thought
l might be able to...

1069
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:29,754
help you out with that little biography
you've been writin' about me.

1070
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:35,639
You know, maybe help fill in
some of the gaps.

1071
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:41,155
Why would l be interested in you?

1072
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:44,158
'Cause l'm a remarkable fellow, Moe.

1073
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:47,989
You've never met anyone
quite like me before.

1074
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,675
God, places like these
are bad for my allergies.

1075
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:59,712
Well, l don't like
to throw things away.

1076
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:05,233
Yeah, well, Moe, sometimes
you got to get rid of the old
to make way for the new.

1077
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:07,635
You know what l mean?

1078
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:09,637
l mean, let's face it.

1079
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:13,150
Old people, they just
kind of clutter up the world.

1080
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:15,430
You know what l mean?

1081
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:17,676
They walk too slow
and they talk too slow...

1082
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:21,315
and they drive too slow
and they're always in the fuckin' way.

1083
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:25,319
Tryin' to remind you
about how things used to be.

1084
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:28,836
Pain in the ass, really.

1085
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:32,435
lf you're looking
for your file, l...

1086
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:35,074
had it copied and put
in the safe-deposit box.

1087
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,030
No.

1088
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:41,674
Not you, Moe.

1089
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:45,873
No computer, no fax, no Xerox.

1090
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:51,596
You wouldn't have
that shit in your office.

1091
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:54,553
Nope. lt's in here somewhere.

1092
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:58,434
Well, feel free to look around.

1093
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:04,434
Well, if you're not gonna
help me look for it,

1094
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,999
Goddam firetrap anyway.

1095
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:19,716
See, the way l see it,
you were workin' late one night,

1096
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:23,992
and you fell asleep with
one of them cigars in your hand.

1097
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:28,477
Stray ash...

1098
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:31,398
fell off and caught
those newspapers on fire.

1099
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,988
You were overcome by smoke.

1100
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:40,199
lt's better than wasting away
in a hospital day after day,
don't you think, Moe?

1101
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:42,834
- l mean, really.
- What?

1102
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:58,669
Damn crazy son of a bitch!
What the fuck are you doin'?

1103
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:34,439
Your car is waiting
for you, Miss Haines.

1104
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:55,757
- Good evening, Miss Haines.
- Hi, Eugene.

1105
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:35,838
l guess it was more of a marriage
than either one of us thought, huh?

1106
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:40,590
'Til death do us part
and all that shit.

1107
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:42,915
You won't do anything to me.

1108
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:47,397
Moe has got a stack of evidence
on you from Boston to Atlanta.

1109
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,431
lf l should have an accident--

1110
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:52,313
You know, it's a good night
for accidents.

1111
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:56,639
Moe already had one.

1112
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:59,228
Oh, well, that changes everything.

1113
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:01,635
God, you've had...

1114
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:05,070
just a terrible month,
haven't you, Jennifer?

1115
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:09,079
First, your boyfriend gets beaten up
and put in the hospital,

1116
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:13,637
then a hung jury, and now your
best friend goes and dies on ya.

1117
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:18,434
Very depressing.

1118
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,960
Suicidally so.

1119
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:25,878
No one's gonna believe you.

1120
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,797
l don't know.

1121
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:31,356
So far, everyone's believed
everything l wanted them to.

1122
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:35,712
And there won't be a mark on ya.

1123
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:38,115
Just a leap from a high place.

1124
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:43,360
How about a mark on you?
Exhibit A! Your skin under my nails!

1125
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:47,393
Exhibit B!
Your hair in my hands!

1126
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:50,592
Exhibit C! Teeth marks!

1127
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:17,396
Oh, God!

1128
01:39:57,680 --> 01:40:00,353
- Watch those doors.
- Watch the doors, Phil.

1129
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:03,552
l wanna see Security
in my office right away.

1130
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:13,671
- You're gonna be fine, darlin'.
- Phil?

1131
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:16,598
You're gonna be just fine.

1132
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:19,075
Relax, ma'am. Try not to move.

1133
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:21,077
Nice and easy.
Don't-- Don't bump her.

1134
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:33,394
