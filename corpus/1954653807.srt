00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,905
It's been two years

183
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,307
since you started
investigating my company.

184
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:12,110
And since then, I've spent
thousands of dollars

185
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:15,847
hiring lawyers to provide you
with every piece of information

186
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,448
that your office has requested.

187
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,384

been asking the same

188
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,953
of my competitors.

189
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:24,889

that you've gained,

00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:26,824
we're just asking

191
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:29,827
do you have any idea
who's been doing this to us?

I don't.

investigating industry-wide
corruption in your business,

that seems to have been
going on for years.

195
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:40,038
So, you're right.

196
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,640
That means you're all
stealing from each other,

197
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,509

198
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:45,910

199

into specifics right now,

you and your company

have evidence to prove that.

00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:45,009
and our drivers
are approachable.

364
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:47,411
Now, after you've
done the math,

365
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:49,914
and you've shown them
how much they can save
over the long haul

366
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:54,251
through proper maintenance,
you need to get them to sign.

367
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:56,820
But the problem is,
by hiring you,

368
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:58,923
they need to fire someone else.

369
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:00,591
And that's never easy.

370
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:01,593
So...

371
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,962
After you show them the number,

372
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,565
you look up at them,

373
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,534
and stare.

374
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,440
Stare longer than you should.

375
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,189
This is not a joke.

376
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:36,460
You will only keep this job
if you close,

377
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:38,362
and that's not funny to you.

378
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,498
I'm only interested
in this company growing,

379
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,101
and when it isn't, it's not
very funny to me at all.

380
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:49,306
These people work very hard
for their money,

381
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:51,508
and these other guys
are ripping them off,

382
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,378
treating them poorly,
because they don't know.

383
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:58,582
So when you look them
in the eye,

384
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:02,386
you have to believe
that we are better,

385
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:10,728
But you will never do anything
as hard as staring someone
straight in the eye

386
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,830
and telling the truth.

387
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:26,010
Well, it was great to meet you.

388
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:27,645
Welcome.

389
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:29,146
And I wish you luck.

00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,233
- You ready?
- Sure.

If there's anything you need,
anything at all,

395
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:08,152
don't hesitate
to call the office.

I'm sorry this happened to you.

See you soon.

Abel, Abel.

399
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:30,641
Do you think I'm ready
to move into sales?

400
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,246
No, I don't.

401
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:41,485
- I don't think
I'd be able to...
- you will.

402

Get some rest.

Catherine!
Katie!

Catherine.

408
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:11,749
Tell me where you found this.

409
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:14,518
- Here in the yard.
- Show me! Where?

410
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:17,821
Come on.

411
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:23,127
- It was just sitting
right here behind...
- did you see this?

412
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:25,429
Well, yeah, she went under there
to get that ball
and came out with it.

- Is it real?
- Are we in trouble?

Maria!

416
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:33,470
It's caused by the drift

00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,555
What is that?

421
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:53,223
It's a gun.

422
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:55,893
It's a fucking gun.

423
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:59,229
Where did you get that?

424
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:02,032
Your youngest daughter
found it in the bushes

425
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:03,834
outside our front door.

426
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:05,903
She was playing with it.

427
00:30:05,905 --> 00:30:08,305
Look, it's loaded,

428
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,940
with the safety off.

429
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:14,578
It wasn't some kid
looking to take our TV.

430
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,247
It was a fucking goon
with a loaded gun

431
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:19,116
looking in our window.

432
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,019
I'll take care of it.

433
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:27,457
What does that mean when
you say you'll take care of it?

434
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:30,127
It's not a brick
through a car window,

00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:32,529
or another of the
cute little warnings

436
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:34,798

This is your kid playing
with a loaded gun.

Let me deal with it.

Oh, you better.

You're not gonna like what'll
happen once I get involved.

Don't do this.

I won't.

I, uh, need to talk
to you both.

Somebody left it there
last night.

We don't know who.

Jesus...

451
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,499
So...

452
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,801
It's not good.

00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:49,840

with charges tomorrow.

Oh, my God.

It's a 14 count indictment.

456
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:55,579
Three counts
I would consider serious.

457
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,247
They know how
the industry works,

458
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,383
so they're gonna charge us
with rigging scales

459
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:02,152
and under-reporting income.

460
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:05,122
We've just pushed it
a little too far, that's all.

461
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:08,592
Let's look at it like, uh,
a badge of honor.

462
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:12,129
Huh? We're big enough now,
they even give a shit about us.

463
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:13,997
Alright, you need
to go home right away,

464
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:16,466
and start going through
our set of books.

465
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,402
How far back are they going?

466
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:22,072
I would imagine when
you bought the business
from Anna's father.

467
00:32:22,074 --> 00:32:23,707
I'll get into it.

the bank.

I need you two
to sit down with them.

I want you both there,

just be upfront,
be honest.

to bigger crooks than us.

How are ya, bill?

478
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:51,702
I'm okay.

479
00:32:51,704 --> 00:32:54,671
Can't say I'm used
to making house calls
like this anymore, though.

480
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:59,543
No, it's alright.
You got bigger things
to worry about.

Yes, yes.
We're good, good.

I would love for you
to help with this

because I can't have it
continue either.

So let them protect themselves,

488
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,927
that would stop
all this very quickly.

00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:18,996
I respectfully disagree.

490
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:20,430
They're picking on your men

491
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:22,799
because they're
just sitting there, weak.

492
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:25,569
They're taking shots at me
because I'm growing,

493
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:28,005
expanding, I'm getting
stronger, not weaker.

494
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:31,108
I can't have my drivers
getting hit like this anymore.

495
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,443
It looks like I can't
protect them.

496
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:35,545
Well, it appears
that you can't.

497
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,451
You seem to be under a lot
of pressure from all sides,

498
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,286
which I understand.

499
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:45,455
Trust me,
I understand it.

500
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:47,491
So...

501
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:50,527
[Sighs]
Let me think this through.

502
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,797
But whatever decision
I come to,

503
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:55,432
it stands.

504
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,369
Those men show up
every morning for you

505
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,905
because I tell them to.

506
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:04,174
You have to realize

507
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:08,045
that these are dangerous times,
and we have to adapt.

508
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:11,281
It's not like when
we was driving.

509
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,752
No. No, it's not.

510
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,489
[Grunts]

511
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:56,326
So how did it go?

512
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,495
Not well.

513
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:01,398
He feels very strongly
about it.

514
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,066
I can see that.

515
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:06,736
I don't think he
fully understands.

516
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,709
What is there to understand?

517
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:14,077
Well...

518
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,383
Well, first of all,
it's illegal.

519
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:23,920
It's not illegal
if I say it isn't.

520
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:28,425
My responsibility is to provide
safe and timely passage

521
00:35:28,427 --> 00:35:32,295
of goods and products
into and around this city.

522
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,564
And because of this situation,

523
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36,233
it is appearing to those,

524
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:38,335
whose opinions I care about,

525
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:40,704
that I can't do my job.

526
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:44,074
That can not
and will not continue.

527
00:35:44,076 --> 00:35:47,010
I-I-I'm not even sure
what you're suggesting.

528
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:48,545
Are you kidding me with this?

529
00:35:48,547 --> 00:35:49,880
No.

530
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:53,316
Every driver in your fleet
gets a handgun.

531
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,920
- And a permit?
- Mm-hmm.

532
00:35:56,922 --> 00:35:58,655
When?

533
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,257
By Friday.

534
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,160
Are the permits legit?

535
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:05,829
That depends on
what they do with it.

536
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,464
They kill their wife with them,
then no.

537
00:36:07,466 --> 00:36:08,832
Then that is
a very fake permit,

538
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,800
and I'll walk away
very quickly.

539
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:14,804
But they just need to show that
they're defending themselves,

540
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:16,273
and it'll stop.

541
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,643
Who is it?

542
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:22,179
I don't know.

543
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:25,682
I don't fucking know.

544
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:30,120
Thank you.

545
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:34,791
Hey!

546
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,694
So I got this machine.

547
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:43,099
I was paying a guy
five bucks an hour
to do this with me last year.

548
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,369
Peter.

549
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:47,837
Yeah?

550
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,673
I need to speak with you.

551
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,609
No, I see that.

552
00:36:52,611 --> 00:36:53,743
Look.

553
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:55,612
I know you've been dealing with

554
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:58,682
a few of your rigs
getting picked off as well,

555
00:36:58,684 --> 00:37:01,518
but this has all gotten
way out of control.

556
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:07,090
There was a guy with a gun
at my house the other night.

557
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:10,260
My wife and children
were home at the time.

558
00:37:10,262 --> 00:37:12,162
Everyone okay?

559
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,100
Yeah, I managed
to chase him off.

560
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,343
What can I do?

561
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:27,345
[Sighs]

562
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,580
I need to know
who's doing this.

563
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,718
- Abel...
- [Abel stammers, sighs]

564
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,953
It's one thing
to go after my trucks

565
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:39,556
and my drivers
and to steal from me.

566
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:41,958
This is different.

567
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,495
Have you ever had to deal
with anything like this?

568
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:47,631
A bunch of thugs
invaded my home

569
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:49,299
when I was a baby.

570
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:50,934
Nothing happened.

571
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:53,336
They were trying
to scare my father.

572
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:56,006
They ended up just leaving.
We never found out who it was.

573
00:37:56,008 --> 00:37:57,540
But after that,

574
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,677
we moved to a fortress,

575
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:02,145
just like this.

576
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:06,750
And those guys who let you in,

577
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:09,986
they're here to shoot anyone
who isn't invited.

578
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:12,922
Yes, well, I refuse
to live my life that way.

579
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:14,491
I won't do it.

580
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,795
I want more than this.

581
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,330
I know you do.

582
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,404
My father's in jail,
as you know.

583
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:28,705
And...

584
00:38:28,707 --> 00:38:31,441
I always wanted to conduct
myself differently than he did.

585
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:32,942
And you have.

586
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,112
Almost exclusively, yes.

587
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:40,550
I know why he did what he did,

588
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:42,919
'cause at the time,
it's easier.

589
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:44,521
But it's not.

590
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:46,923
Yes, it is.

591
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,077
[Woman over radio]
<i>Where is he now?</i>

592
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,878
[Man over radio]
<i>I just dropped him off</i>
<i>at the hospital.</i>

593
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,847
<i>He seems fine.</i>

594
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,817
[Woman]
<i>I think you should come on in.</i>

595
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:15,518
[Knocking on door]
Hey.

596
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,659
They just got another truck.

597
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:24,194
I know.

598
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:26,296
Who was driving?

599
00:39:26,298 --> 00:39:27,997
Leo.

600
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:29,866
Is he alright?

601
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:32,102
Yes.

602
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:37,340
You know,
driver's security aside,

603
00:39:37,342 --> 00:39:41,745
this shit is having
a significant financial effect
on this company.

604
00:39:41,747 --> 00:39:43,613
It-it can't continue.

605
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:44,981
Oh, I know.

606
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,617
How was your talk?

607
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:50,286
I spoke with him afterward.

608
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:52,522
I said I wouldn't do it.

609
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:59,996
I don't think we're in
a position to say that.

610
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:02,999
What's that?

611
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:03,900
Why don't you take a walk
with me?

612
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,368
Come on.

613
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:08,805
[Stammering]
Are you serious with this?
This is what it's come to?

614
00:40:08,807 --> 00:40:12,142
We have to walk around outside
like we're fucking gangsters?

615
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:14,711
I am.

616
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,080
And it is.

617
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,492
It looks like we must do this.

618
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:31,628
Must?

619
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,296
Yeah, or they'll shut us down.

620
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,000
These men,
they work for me.

621
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:39,736
The trucks they drive,
the customers they serve,

622
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:42,138
it's all here
because I built this.

623
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,740
That's true.

624
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:45,074
Until it isn't.

625
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:49,212
The last guy in the world
that we want problems with

626
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:52,015
is the head
of the fucking teamsters.

627
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:55,251
We're out of business
in a month if they tell
these guys to walk.

628
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:56,553
We don't have the cash.

629
00:40:56,555 --> 00:40:59,556
It will be the end of everything
we have worked for.

630
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:01,591
If one of these guys
shoots someone,

631
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:03,827
they're gonna
bring me down for it.

632
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:05,995
I'm not gonna do it.

633
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:07,497
I'll talk to him.

634
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:11,835
We need to close this deal.

635
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:13,736
We cannot stay like this
any longer.

636
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:16,339
We have to close
on that property.

637
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:18,475
We're so weak right now.

638
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,548
Why do you want this so badly?

639
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,020
Because I've got
my entire savings at risk
on this deposit...

640
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:33,389
No, no, no,
I don't mean the deposit.

641
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:35,225
I mean... this.

642
00:41:35,227 --> 00:41:36,826
Why do you want it?

643
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:39,295
Have you ever thought about it?

644
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:43,600
I've thought about it every day
for the last five years.

645
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:47,003
That place has just been sitting
right across that fence
mocking me...

646
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,005
I'm not talking
about that place.

647
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,574
I-I just meant... everything.

648
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,644
Why do you want it so much?

649
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:58,581
I have no idea what you mean.

650
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:04,187
- Arthur.
- Anna.

651
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:07,056
You look as lovely as always.
- Thank you.

652
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:09,993
Gentlemen,
do you know Ian Thompson,
one of our new vps.

653
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:11,661
- Ian.
- Hello, Ian.

654
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:13,997
You're good?

655
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:14,999
Good.

656
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,536
Alright.

657
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,037
Hungry?

658
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:23,473
So, what can I
get you to drink?

659
00:42:23,475 --> 00:42:25,108
A lot.
[Laughing]

660
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,210
Wine list, please.
- I'll be right back.

661
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:29,946
So...

662
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:31,247
How are you?

663
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,483
We've been better,

664
00:42:33,485 --> 00:42:35,218
but we're good.

665
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,020
Yes, I heard about that.

666
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:38,721
If you stay in business
long enough,

667
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,156
it's bound to happen eventually.

668
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:42,592
Well, that's exactly right,
Arthur.

669
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:45,128
That's why we wanted
to sit down with you tonight

670
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:47,497
and be up front about
everything that's going on.

671
00:42:47,499 --> 00:42:49,999
Make sure you understand
the nature of the complaints

672
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:52,502
and that,
even in a worst case scenario,

673
00:42:52,504 --> 00:42:54,771
we'll move forward with very
comfortable capital on hand.

674
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:57,006
Yes, but you should know,
Arthur,

675
00:42:57,008 --> 00:42:59,776
that this man has been
digging through our industry

676
00:42:59,778 --> 00:43:02,812
looking for anything
it can find for the last
two years now.

677
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:06,049
And the thought that
he would single us out,

678
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:07,650
it's ridiculous.

679
00:43:07,652 --> 00:43:08,785
Thank you.

680
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:12,956
I run a fair
and clean business,

681
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:15,358
and we follow every
standard industry practice,

682
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,961
and I will fight till
my last breath to prove that.

683
00:43:17,963 --> 00:43:19,095
But...

684
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,164
Don't think for a moment
that I'm gonna let this mess

685
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:23,766
interfere with our plans
to grow.

686
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,636
And we need to know
that you're standing with us.

687
00:43:26,638 --> 00:43:27,704
Yes.

688
00:43:27,706 --> 00:43:32,842
What is it about this property
that makes you feel
it's so integral?

689
00:43:32,844 --> 00:43:34,811
That you can't put it off until

690
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:37,614
after all these legal matters
are settled?

691
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:42,251
That's a very good question.

692
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,989
This property gives us
many things.

693
00:43:45,991 --> 00:43:48,625
First, access to the river,

694
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:50,627
so I can bring in
my fuel directly

695
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:52,829
from any provider
in the world

696
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:54,297
straight to my tanks.

697
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:58,735
Second, it has over ten million
gallons of storage capacity,

698
00:43:58,737 --> 00:44:02,038
so I can buy in the summers,
when the price is low,

699
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,140
and sell to my customers,
and more importantly,

700
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,442
my competitors
when the price is high.

701
00:44:06,444 --> 00:44:08,778
I will no longer
just drive trucks.

702
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,613
I will control my fate.

703
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:15,785
But the real answer
to your question

704
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:18,721
is that when it feels
scary to jump, Ian,

705
00:44:18,723 --> 00:44:21,591
that is exactly when you jump.

706
00:44:21,593 --> 00:44:24,994
Otherwise, you end up
staying in the same place
your whole life,

707
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,829
and that, I can't do.

708
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,401
We've always been there
with you,

709
00:44:31,403 --> 00:44:33,036
and know

710
00:44:33,038 --> 00:44:35,104
that we will continue to be.

711
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:37,674
Good.
- Thanks, Arthur.

712
00:44:37,676 --> 00:44:41,377
I don't think we have to eat.
[Laughing]

713
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:44,747
That went really good.

714
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:48,117
Arthur's a good man.

715
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:53,122
They're gonna close.

716
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:56,292
Of course.

717

1079
01:14:15,118 --> 01:14:16,951
I threw it in the river.

1080
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:18,586
Good.

1081
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:22,390
When we did
our background check

1082
01:14:22,392 --> 01:14:23,791
it said you'd
never been arrested.

1083
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,426
Is that true?

1084
01:14:26,328 --> 01:14:29,030
Why is this putting
everything at risk?

1085
01:14:29,032 --> 01:14:33,167
I asked you if you've
ever been arrested.

1086
01:14:33,169 --> 01:14:34,268
No.

1087
01:14:34,937 --> 01:14:38,573
Because no bank will touch us.

1088
01:14:38,575 --> 01:14:41,709
Because if he can't close
on that piece of property

1089
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:45,546
then your buddy here
loses everything.

1090
01:14:45,548 --> 01:14:47,081
That's why.

1091
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:49,851
Here.

1092
01:14:52,554 --> 01:14:54,589
This is an attorney

1093
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:56,991
that'll meet you
at the station.

1094
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:03,798
You no longer work for us.
You've been fired.

1095
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:07,034
Abel would like
to pay for the lawyer.

1096
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:10,872
Good luck.

1097
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:28,990
I'm sorry.

1098
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:32,059
I know.

1099
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:36,197
I was scared.

1100
01:15:37,799 --> 01:15:39,433
Yeah, I know.

1101
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:41,769
You don't get scared?

1102
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:46,073
I've always been a lot more
afraid for failure

1103
01:15:46,075 --> 01:15:48,142
than of anything else.

1104
01:15:58,287 --> 01:16:00,421
It wasn't always like this.

1105
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,625
I am sorry.

1106
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:08,062
Good.

1107
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:11,766
Okay.

1108
01:16:14,803 --> 01:16:18,506
I am not... I am not strong.

1109
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:23,010
That doesn't have to be true.
- Listen to me.

1110
01:16:23,012 --> 01:16:25,446
Trust me.
Trust me.

1111
01:16:25,448 --> 01:16:28,883
I'm not...
- Oh, yeah.

1112
01:16:28,885 --> 01:16:30,818
That's enough.

1113
01:16:46,168 --> 01:16:49,570
¶ ¶

1114
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:52,406
hey...

1115
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:56,110
I am sorry.

1116
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:03,551
[Cop]
He's running!

1117
01:17:03,553 --> 01:17:05,753
[Cops shouting]

1118
01:17:06,688 --> 01:17:08,289
[Cop]
Officers in pursuit.

1119
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:10,491
Suspect on foot!

1120
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,028
[Police siren blaring]

1121
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:23,237
¶ ¶

1122
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:26,574
[panting]

1123
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:53,801
Thank you for seeing me.

1124
01:17:53,803 --> 01:17:55,036
Of course.

1125
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:58,973
Actually, I think we have
met before, but...

1126
01:17:58,975 --> 01:18:01,409
I didn't realize that you
were Saul's granddaughter.

1127
01:18:01,411 --> 01:18:06,280
My grandfather didn't trust
any of his children
to run the business.

1128
01:18:06,282 --> 01:18:07,348
Yes.

1129
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:12,586
I know that you tried to buy
the company from my grandfather
several times.

1130
01:18:12,588 --> 01:18:17,091
His goal was to stay healthy
long enough to be able
to give the company to me,

1131
01:18:17,093 --> 01:18:18,793
which he thankfully did.

1132
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:22,296
So while I appreciate
your visit,

1133
01:18:22,298 --> 01:18:24,799
we are still not for sale.

1134
01:18:24,801 --> 01:18:27,535
I'm not here to offer
to buy your company.

1135
01:18:27,537 --> 01:18:28,669
- Oh.

1136
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:31,372
- But as you will soon learn,

1137
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:34,008
some years are good,

1138
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:36,310
and others, not so.

1139
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:44,151
I am under contract with
a significant hard deposit

1140
01:18:44,153 --> 01:18:47,388
at risk to purchase
the old bay front terminal.

1141
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:48,756
- I see.

1142
01:18:48,758 --> 01:18:50,524
And...

1143
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:54,528
Due to...

1144
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:57,398
Circumstances
out of my control...

1145
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:02,002
My bank has left me
at the altar.

1146
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:05,773
So I'm here.

1147
01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:09,877
Hat in hand.

1148
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:13,581
Looking for a loan.

1149
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:20,821
I certainly expect the terms
to be in your favor.

1150
01:19:20,823 --> 01:19:25,126
But if your grandfather trusted
you with his company,

1151
01:19:25,128 --> 01:19:28,863
then I would be willing to
trust you as my lien holder.

1152
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:31,899
How much?

1153
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:36,771
I need
a million-and-a-half dollars.

1154
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,281
Would you give us a minute?

1155
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:58,459
[Phone rings]

1156
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:03,531
[Woman] Yes?

1157
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:11,272
You can go back in.

1158
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:15,843
[Exhales sharply]

1159
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:23,117
[Door closes]

1160
01:20:25,554 --> 01:20:29,423
We can offer you 500,000
at 20% for a year.

1161
01:20:29,425 --> 01:20:32,326
And we would need a five-year
straight wholesale
holding agreement

1162
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:36,730
for 250,000 gallons a year
at your new facility.

1163
01:20:45,073 --> 01:20:46,540
Okay.

1164
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:50,411
Thank you.

1165
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,848
Thank you.

1166
01:20:57,419 --> 01:21:00,487
So uh, I should start by
thanking you for your

1167
01:21:00,489 --> 01:21:03,591
assistance in attempting
to bring in the driver.

1168
01:21:03,593 --> 01:21:05,926
Yeah, we didn't expect him
to react that way.

1169
01:21:05,928 --> 01:21:09,663
Yeah well, the officers there
didn't set it up very well on
their end, either.

1170
01:21:09,665 --> 01:21:11,532
I'm sorry.

1171
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:13,534
Miss lange?

1172
01:21:13,536 --> 01:21:17,204
It has been brought to our
attention that it might be

1173
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:19,974
beneficial on your end
to resolve this issue

1174
01:21:19,976 --> 01:21:21,775
in a time-sensitive way.

1175
01:21:21,777 --> 01:21:23,777
It's a possibility.

1176
01:21:23,779 --> 01:21:28,148
- So, we have prepared an offer
for you to review.

1177
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:37,324
I'll present it to him.

1178
01:21:37,326 --> 01:21:39,293
[Lawrence] That's good, Andrew.

1179
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:42,396
Okay.

1180
01:21:46,668 --> 01:21:48,469
[Whispers indistinctly]

1181
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:13,661
[Exasperated sigh]

1182
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:16,964
[Abel] I need more time.

1183
01:22:16,966 --> 01:22:18,732
[Joseph] Hm.

1184
01:22:18,734 --> 01:22:20,668
Of course you do.

1185
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:23,837
I know our agreement
doesn't allow for that.

1186
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:28,943
But I need more time.

1187
01:22:31,546 --> 01:22:35,115
It is a difficult time
to do business.

1188
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:37,284
- Yes, yes it is.

1189
01:22:38,486 --> 01:22:40,421
I um...

1190
01:22:43,058 --> 01:22:45,326
I'll give you three days.

1191
01:22:45,328 --> 01:22:48,595
But then, it's over.

1192
01:22:48,597 --> 01:22:51,365
Thank you.
Thank you, Joseph.

1193
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:54,368
- You're welcome.

1194
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,737
[Exhales sharply]

1195
01:23:01,576 --> 01:23:03,777
[Indistinct chatter]

1196
01:23:13,288 --> 01:23:15,923
Abel, please sit down.

1197
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:19,593
Andrew?
- Yes?

1198
01:23:19,595 --> 01:23:22,129
- How are you?
- Well.

1199
01:23:30,538 --> 01:23:32,006
Abel...

1200
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:42,449
Stop.

1201
01:23:57,632 --> 01:23:59,733
[Peter] Um...

1202
01:23:59,735 --> 01:24:04,171
Abel, we had a chance to meet
for a little bit
before you got here,

1203
01:24:04,173 --> 01:24:06,040
and...

1204
01:24:06,042 --> 01:24:08,909
Of course everyone in this room
is fully capable of lying

1205
01:24:08,911 --> 01:24:13,180
to their own mothers on their
deathbeds [Laughs nervously],

1206
01:24:13,182 --> 01:24:16,884
but the conclusion that we've
come to... and I should say that

1207
01:24:16,886 --> 01:24:21,955
we feel fairly certain after
a very Frank conversation,

1208
01:24:21,957 --> 01:24:26,293
that the guys
who are doing this...

1209
01:24:26,295 --> 01:24:30,631
That they're not actually
working for anyone
in this room.

1210
01:24:30,633 --> 01:24:33,901
As you know, there are plenty
of other smaller providers

1211
01:24:33,903 --> 01:24:36,170
in the area that might have
something to do with it,

1212
01:24:36,172 --> 01:24:38,338
who are not here tonight.

1213
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:41,108
Peter, thank you.

1214
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:43,277
Thank you.
That may be true.

1215
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:51,785
But over the last six months,
110,000 gallons of fuel

1216
01:24:51,787 --> 01:24:54,822
have been stolen from me
and my family.

1217
01:24:56,724 --> 01:25:00,761
Now the reason we asked bill
to get you all here,

1218
01:25:00,763 --> 01:25:02,629
is because...

1219
01:25:02,631 --> 01:25:05,466
The people at this table
are the only people

1220
01:25:05,468 --> 01:25:08,202
within two hundred Miles
of here that have the ability

1221
01:25:08,204 --> 01:25:14,074
to purchase and store
that kind of quantity.

1222
01:25:15,877 --> 01:25:17,578
So...

1223
01:25:20,048 --> 01:25:23,550
No matter what bullshit you've
been telling each other...

1224
01:25:23,552 --> 01:25:25,385
One of you...

1225
01:25:25,387 --> 01:25:27,154
Or two...

1226
01:25:27,822 --> 01:25:29,723
Or three...

1227
01:25:29,725 --> 01:25:31,792
Have been allowing this
to happen,

1228
01:25:31,794 --> 01:25:33,760
by buying it
from these cowards,

1229
01:25:33,762 --> 01:25:37,664
or worse yet,
hiring them to do it.

1230
01:25:37,666 --> 01:25:40,267
So, what I'm saying is: Stop.

1231
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:45,839
Now.

1232
01:25:54,015 --> 01:25:56,950
Have some pride in what you do.

1233
01:25:56,952 --> 01:25:58,919
And stop.

1234
01:26:01,756 --> 01:26:04,691
[Machine whirring]

1235
01:26:28,816 --> 01:26:30,217
Hi.

1236
01:26:31,085 --> 01:26:32,319
Hi.

1237
01:26:37,759 --> 01:26:39,526
How's it coming?

1238
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:41,962
[Sighs]

1239
01:26:42,764 --> 01:26:45,199
I got to 1975.

1240
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:49,069
1975, that was a good year.

1241
01:26:50,004 --> 01:26:51,371
No?

1242
01:26:53,841 --> 01:26:55,509
How is it?

1243
01:26:55,511 --> 01:26:57,578
- Oh, I'm not sure yet.

1244
01:26:57,580 --> 01:27:00,280
But I don't think it's as bad
as they're saying it is.

1245
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:04,151
'Cos I kinda knew
what I was doing.

1246
01:27:08,756 --> 01:27:10,824
How'd you do?

1247
01:27:10,826 --> 01:27:12,960
Got us three more days.

1248
01:27:12,962 --> 01:27:14,828
That's great.

1249
01:27:14,830 --> 01:27:17,231
I got a piece from Saul.

1250
01:27:18,499 --> 01:27:21,368
But we're still about
a million short.

1251
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:25,372
[Chuckles]

1252
01:27:28,876 --> 01:27:32,246
Well, you're gonna go see
your little brother.

1253
01:27:32,248 --> 01:27:33,947
- First thing.

1254
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,150
- And Peter.

01:28:07,548 --> 01:28:10,450
Their dad was out there...

1262

felony charges for anything
that we've done.

1613
01:57:35,883 --> 01:57:37,349
I know.

1614
01:57:38,751 --> 01:57:40,485
I'm not a felon.

1615
01:57:40,487 --> 01:57:42,921
That's probably true.

1616
01:57:44,457 --> 01:57:46,992
But I also can't have you
digging around in my life

1617
01:57:46,994 --> 01:57:50,929
for the next ten years,
hanging this around my neck.

1618
01:57:50,931 --> 01:57:53,432
Look, I love a good battle...

1619
01:57:53,434 --> 01:57:56,835
But this is very bad
for my business.

1620
01:57:56,837 --> 01:58:00,372
So we need to come to some
sort of conclusion.

1621
01:58:00,374 --> 01:58:02,107
We can probably do that.

1622
01:58:03,242 --> 01:58:04,476
Good.

1623
01:58:06,179 --> 01:58:09,748
So, I hear you closed
on this terminal today.

1624
01:58:09,750 --> 01:58:11,416
Yeah, it looks that way.

1625
01:58:11,418 --> 01:58:15,320
I didn't realize this is what
you had in the works.

1626
01:58:15,322 --> 01:58:18,523
Yeah, for a very long time.

1627
01:58:19,559 --> 01:58:22,527
This could put you in quite
a powerful position.

1628
01:58:22,529 --> 01:58:25,764
I mean, you get this place
up and running,

1629
01:58:25,766 --> 01:58:28,200
it'll have
significant influence...

1630
01:58:29,669 --> 01:58:31,570
Politically speaking.

1631
01:58:34,207 --> 01:58:38,176
We all have our ambitions,
Abel.

1632
01:58:38,178 --> 01:58:41,279
Sometimes we need help
to get there.

1633
01:58:44,083 --> 01:58:45,417
Yes.

1634
01:58:47,386 --> 01:58:49,521
You've come a very long way...

1635
01:58:50,656 --> 01:58:52,858
In a very short time.

1636
01:58:52,860 --> 01:58:54,826
Well, it doesn't feel that way.

1637
01:58:54,828 --> 01:58:56,461
[Lawrence chuckles]

1638
01:58:56,463 --> 01:59:00,799
But you should know that I have
always taken the path
that is most right.

1639
01:59:00,801 --> 01:59:02,367
The most right?

1640
01:59:03,002 --> 01:59:04,636
The result...

1641
01:59:04,638 --> 01:59:07,472
Is never in question for me.

1642
01:59:07,474 --> 01:59:11,543
Just what path do you take
to get there.

1643
01:59:11,545 --> 01:59:15,247
And there is always one
that is most right.

1644
01:59:15,249 --> 01:59:17,415
And that is what this is.

1645
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:22,587
I hope so.

1646
01:59:29,095 --> 01:59:30,662
