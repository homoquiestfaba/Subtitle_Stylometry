1
00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:10,401
Received a tip off that someone was passing
counterfeit bills

2
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:12,055
at a bar in Glendale.

3
00:00:13,317 --> 00:00:16,233
This is exhibit D. Is this one of the
counterfeit 100 dollar bills

4
00:00:16,407 --> 00:00:18,366
you confiscated at the bar?
Yes.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,846
And this is a blow up
of the counterfeit bill,

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,066
a very good job.

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,982
Now, how did you proceed
after confiscating the counterfeit bills?

8
00:00:26,156 --> 00:00:28,265
Our investigation led us to
the house of Mr. Feldstein.

9
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:29,809
We're searching
covered items connected

10
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:31,944
with a forging of US
treasury bank notes.

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,859
Plates?
Yes, plates.

12
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,055
This is exhibit E, and where
did you find these plates?

13
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,883
In a rolled up desk in
Mr. Feldstein's house.

14
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:40,067
Can you think of any reason
why someone would possess

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,432
these plates,

16
00:00:41,606 --> 00:00:42,346
other than to print
their own money?

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,520
None at all.

18
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:45,132
No further questions.

19
00:00:45,306 --> 00:00:46,872
Mr. McBride, your witness.

20
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,178
Thank you, Your Honor.

21
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:55,185
Detective King, these are

22
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:57,511
definitely the plates you found

23
00:00:57,535 --> 00:00:59,363
in Mr. Feldstein's house?

24
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:00,732
That's right.
Take you long to find them?

25
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:02,453
Got five minutes.

26
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:12,159
Not much of a hiding place.

27
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,133
Maybe some people are
dumber than you think.

28
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:15,640
As yourself.

29
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:18,165
Find any other evidence?
No.

30
00:01:18,339 --> 00:01:20,210
Printing press,
counterfeit bills?

31
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,646
No.

32
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,126
These plates?
That's it.

33
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,538
Did you print any
bills with these?

34
00:01:24,562 --> 00:01:26,042
Didn't have to.
He had the,

35
00:01:26,216 --> 00:01:28,056
plates and the counterfeit bills
from Glendale.

36
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,480
Ah, these plates?

37
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:31,174
Yes.
I think we've established that

38
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:33,108
those are the plates
at Mr. Feldstein's house.

39
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,529
Yes, thank you Your Honor.

40
00:01:34,703 --> 00:01:35,486
With the court's permission

41
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,010
I would like to

42
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:40,665
examine this evidence a
little more thoroughly.

43
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:43,886
Phil?

44
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:50,327
If you'll look closely,
you will see that

45
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:54,114
the plates confiscated
by Detective King

46
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:56,377
in Mr. Feldstein's apartment,

47
00:01:56,551 --> 00:01:59,554
that Benjamin Franklin
seems to be wearing, what?

48
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:01,295
A set of headphones.

49
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,340
And that the banner
under the White House

50
00:02:03,514 --> 00:02:05,995
reads "House of Rock."

51
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:07,668
Now we all know that
Benjamin Franklin invented

52
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:09,694
many useful and
interesting things,

53
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:12,088
but I'm almost certain

54
00:02:12,262 --> 00:02:14,569
that headphones were not
among those inventions.

55
00:02:14,743 --> 00:02:16,397
That's not possible.

56
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:18,011
So there's no way
that those plates

57
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,140
could have printed
the counterfeit money

58
00:02:20,314 --> 00:02:22,707
that was confiscated
in Glendale.

59
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:24,555
That's probably why they
were so easy to find.

60
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:26,379
Mr. Feldstein wasn't
even trying to hide them.

61
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,235
That must be a mistake.

62
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:29,975
Feldstein's a convicted
counterfeiter.

63
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,370
Who paid his debt to
society over 23 years ago.

64
00:02:33,544 --> 00:02:35,198
Your honor, Mr.
Feldstein was hired

65
00:02:35,372 --> 00:02:36,852
by a movie production company

66
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:39,028
to make dummy plates and
play money for a film

67
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:41,639
called Easy Money.

68
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:44,251
Mr. Garcia, would you stand sir?

69
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:47,210
Mr. Garcia was the property
master on the film.

70
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:48,864
I have a sworn affidavit here

71
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:52,389
that he hired Mo Feldstein
to make dummy plates

72
00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:54,609
and a hundred thousand
dollars worth of play money

73
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:55,784
to be used in the movie.

74
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:56,958
I don't, you know,

75
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:58,917
I, I can't, I think...

76
00:02:59,091 --> 00:03:01,616
Your honor, I have no further
questions of this witness.

77
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:08,405
Witness may step down.

78
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:13,236
Hey, you were on
fire in there McBride.

79
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,238
You're a regular Atticus Finch.

80
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:19,000
Hopperly might take
exception to that, but thanks.

81
00:03:19,024 --> 00:03:22,071
You know Mo, you should
have destroyed those plates

82
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:24,247
after the movie production
was over, you know that?

83
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:26,162
Yeah they took
so long to make.

84
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,337
It was my finest work.

85
00:03:27,511 --> 00:03:29,818
I couldn't destroy them.

86
00:03:29,992 --> 00:03:31,796
Mo, you know the police are
gonna have to destroy them.

87
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,300
That's a shame.

88
00:03:33,474 --> 00:03:35,519
Let's see the police
destroying a Van Gogh.

89
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:37,781
A real Van Gogh?

90
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,747
And we're back!

91
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:47,314
And we're here
talking with Tracy,

92
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:48,793
an aspiring singer.

93
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:50,447
Not aspiring, Marty.

94
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:52,144
I'm close to cutting an album.

95
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,799
I could do a number
for your audience.

96
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:01,502
Well, I'm sure that
would be wonderful, Tracy.

97
00:04:01,676 --> 00:04:04,331
Unfortunately we have
our show to shoot.

98
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:05,636
Which you are the star.

99
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,947
So, let's get right down to it.

100
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:16,604
Revealing a secret
can be very painful.

101
00:04:16,778 --> 00:04:19,607
But for other, keeping
it bottled up inside

102
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:21,304
can be worse.

103
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:22,934
Today's guest is here
because she wants to tell

104
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:26,396
her boyfriend, La
Verita, the truth.

105
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:32,533
So, let's bring out
Tracy's boyfriend, Joe.

106
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,234
Joe, me casa, su casa.

107
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:39,559
Thanks.
Welcome have a seat.

108
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:40,323
Hey.

109
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:41,846
So good looking.

110
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,631
Now Joe, you know you're here

111
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:45,894
because Tracy wants
to tell you something.

112
00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:48,592
But, what Tracy
doesn't know is that

113
00:04:49,898 --> 00:04:53,467
you have a question
for her, don't you?

114
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:54,642
I sure do.

115
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:57,688
Joe, the world is your stage.

116
00:04:57,862 --> 00:04:59,560
And we're all here for you, pal.

117
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:00,734
Aren't we, folks?

118
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,216
Here you go.

119
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:05,696
You heard them.

120
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,829
I know it's taken
me a long time

121
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:11,006
to get around to
this, but oh heck,

122
00:05:12,877 --> 00:05:14,923
I love you Tracy Ann Cannacot.

123
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:25,803
Will you marry me?

124
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:26,977
Ooh!

125
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:30,504
Joe is waiting for an answer.

126
00:05:30,678 --> 00:05:31,678
But,

127
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:33,507
before you give it,

128
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:40,514
do you want to tell
him your secret?

129
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:45,693
Tracy, Tracy, Tracy, Tracy!

130
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:46,867
Tracy?

131
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:49,436
What is it, honey?

132
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,650
I'm seeing someone else.

133
00:05:52,743 --> 00:05:54,658
What are you saying, honey.

134
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:57,487
Let's bring him out!

135
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:01,578
Hey Joe.

136
00:06:01,752 --> 00:06:03,275
Hey, Eddie.

137
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,538
Sorry pal.

138
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:10,065
You're seeing Eddie?

139
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:16,332
Let's go man!

140
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:17,638
Frame it up.

141
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:19,466
Pull him off of there!

142
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,902
You knew!

143
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:23,774
You knew what I was gonna say!

144
00:06:23,948 --> 00:06:25,907
Who do you think you are?

145
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:27,909
I'll kill you!

146
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,301
I'll kill you for this!

147
00:06:29,476 --> 00:06:30,636
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

148
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:32,217
it may have take
a thousand shows

149
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,524
but you heard it right
here tonight, live.

150
00:06:34,698 --> 00:06:36,221
I just got my
first death threat.

151
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:38,222
How sweet it is.

152
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:39,790
So, until the next time,

153
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:43,011
love, peace and happiness.

154
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:47,798
Goodnight.

155
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:51,411
Good job Marty.
Well, tell me.Magnificent show, buddy boy.

156
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:53,369
Think so?
Yeah, best yet Marty.

157
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:54,543
Congratulations, Marty.

158
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:56,894
Thank you, sweetheart.

159
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:58,908
There's nothing for
you to do except to relax

160
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,332
and enjoy your party.

161
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:02,422
Well, since you
say so, I will.

162
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:04,836
Okay, you can smother him
with love at the party later.

163
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:06,295
Right?

164
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:08,645
Come on.

165
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,908
How about if I just
give you the jacket, okay?

166
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:12,693
Now go and get my suit,

167
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:14,018
the one that I'm
wearing to the party.

168
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:15,149
Just have to press this shirt.

169
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:16,194
I'll get it for you Marty.

170
00:07:16,218 --> 00:07:16,958
Whatever, chop chop!

171
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:17,959
That guy Joe,

172
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:19,482
lunatic, loved him!

173
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:20,657
You were heroic.

174
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,832
Really?
Oh yeah.

175
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:23,027
Death threat, I get chills.

176
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:24,051
Emmy?

177
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:24,966
Oh, Oscar, television.

178
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,576
It's your story.

179
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,814
So how does it feel
to hit a milestone,

180
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:28,926
10 years on the air.

181
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,493
Feels like 50.

182
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:32,234
Come on.

183
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:34,366
Get a couple of glasses
of bubbly inside you.

184
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:35,542
You'll feel better.

185
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:36,543
Look, you're tired.

186
00:07:36,717 --> 00:07:37,717
It was a tough show.

187
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:39,067
Very tough.

188
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:40,721
It was a tough year.

189
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:41,895
You think?

190
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:44,440
Well, you could take
a break, you know.

191
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,682
Where am I gonna go?

192
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:47,249
Uh, Corma?

193
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:48,816
No come on, I'm serious.

194
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,034
No one goes there.

195
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,384
I don't know, Maui, Barbados.

196
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:54,691
Come on, get your
batteries recharged.

197
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:56,476
You know, get yourself fit.

198
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,105
Come out for the
next season fighting.

199
00:07:58,129 --> 00:07:59,129
Pow!
Oh!

200
00:07:59,217 --> 00:08:00,567
Not the face.

201
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:02,264
Love you, mean it,
see you in 30 min.

202
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:07,530
A little higher
on the right, please.

203
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,880
Becky, almost ready?

204
00:08:10,054 --> 00:08:11,054
That's good.

205
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:15,799
You really outdid yourself
with today's featured guest.

206
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:18,062
Well, perfect way
to mark 10 years.

207
00:08:18,236 --> 00:08:19,411
And counting.

208
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:20,587
Look out Oprah.

209
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,155
The guy was really bum, though.

210
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:25,722
Yeah, how was
he when they left?

211
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:28,508
He gave security
quite a fight.

212
00:08:28,682 --> 00:08:30,074
Over there, please.

213
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:31,815
Everybody gets their moment.

214
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:39,954
Come on, the party's starting.

215
00:08:59,843 --> 00:09:00,843
Ah!

216
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:11,159
Victoria, you look ravishing.

217
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,640
You're too good for him.

218
00:09:13,814 --> 00:09:15,094
That's what I always tell him.

219
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:27,915
Hey.

220
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:29,283
Hey, Arnie.
Any sign of him?

221
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:30,700
He was a little tired.

222
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:32,441
I'm not surprised if
he's running late.

223
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,726
Let's give him a call.
You've reached Marty's cell phone.

224
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,750
Well, no answer.

225
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:38,403
He must be on his way.

226
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,666
Everybody!

227
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,667
We're gonna get ready now.

228
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:42,103
Marty's on his way down.

229
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,892
Just gonna be a moment now.
All right.

230
00:09:57,771 --> 00:09:59,860
Hey, stop right there, you.

231
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:01,034
Freeze!

232
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:04,778
What are you doing?

233
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:07,084
I didn't do nothing!

234
00:10:07,258 --> 00:10:07,955
I didn't do nothing!

235
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:09,391
I swear.

236
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:10,565
Shut up!
Get off!

237
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:22,665
Whoa, you can't come in here.

238
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:25,755
Did he use that to kill Marty?

239
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:28,089
Looks like it. That's Marty's
Viewer's Choice Award.

240
00:10:28,236 --> 00:10:29,846
Some people have no respect.

241
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,020
Marsh.

242
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:35,199
What have we got?
Marty Caine.

243
00:10:35,373 --> 00:10:37,854
Looks like he was
hit over the head.

244
00:10:38,028 --> 00:10:39,029
Anything taken?

245
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:40,030
Not that we know of.

246
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:43,077
But we're still looking.

247
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:44,469
Who's the guy at the door?

248
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,688
Arnie Wilson,

249
00:10:45,862 --> 00:10:46,994
the show's producer.

250
00:10:49,387 --> 00:10:51,085
Captain's gonna love this.

251
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:06,100
In entertainment news,

252
00:11:06,274 --> 00:11:07,754
police confirm this morning

253
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:09,930
that popular television
host, Marty Caine,

254
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:12,062
was murdered in his
office last night.

255
00:11:12,236 --> 00:11:13,823
All right so this thing
is supposed to make us

256
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:15,805
a better cup of coffee, right?

257
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:18,286
Preparing for a party

258
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,201
celebrating his 10 year...

259
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,463
Hey, hey look.

260
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:23,291
Roberta, she looks good, huh?

261
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:25,119
Police
have take A Joseph Devine

262
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:26,686
into custody.
Hold on a second.

263
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,359
Didn't we have a client
named Joe Devine?

264
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,645
We did.

265
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:31,734
We had a client
named Joe Devine.

266
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:32,908
We wrote up a,

267
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:34,737
a record contract for him.

268
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:36,913
He was make a, a demo CD

269
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,089
for his girlfriend's singing.

270
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:40,787
Witnesses say Mr. Devine

271
00:11:40,961 --> 00:11:43,050
made death threats
against shock talk show.

272
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:49,099
Not anymore.
Before being escorted off by security.

273
00:11:49,273 --> 00:11:50,884
I didn't do it.

274
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:53,103
15 million people
heard you and saw you

275
00:11:53,277 --> 00:11:54,583
threaten to kill Marty Caine.

276
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:56,759
And then you show
up at his party

277
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:58,152
covered in his blood.

278
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:00,632
I know it looks bad.

279
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:02,025
Yeah.

280
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:06,203
All right.

281
00:12:06,377 --> 00:12:08,292
Tell me what happened
after the show.

282
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:09,990
I sat in my car,

283
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:11,426
steaming mad.

284
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:15,038
That guy Caine set me
up to look like a fool

285
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:16,518
on national television.

286
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:20,217
I'm down on one knee
proposing to my girlfriend.

287
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:22,829
He drags out my
supposed friend, Eddie

288
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:25,092
so Tracy can tell me
she's sleeping with him?

289
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,312
To Marty Caine

290
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:29,879
this is just another
episode of TV.

291
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:32,186
But to me and Tracy,
this is our lives.

292
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:34,971
What'd you do?

293
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:37,104
I thought that if I
explained that to him

294
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:38,453
he would understand.

295
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,344
You know, maybe he would take
more care with another guest

296
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,154
the next time.

297
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:45,328
Then what?

298
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:51,074
At first I couldn't see him.

299
00:13:07,308 --> 00:13:10,398
You could've just
called for help.

300
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:16,143
I was scared. I...

301
00:13:16,317 --> 00:13:18,232
Was he dead?
He was still warm.

302
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:20,625
And that's how you got
blood all over your hands?

303
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,192
I panicked.

304
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:23,411
I didn't know what to do.

305
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:25,892
Could have called for help.

306
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:28,764
I was scared.

307
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:30,853
I must've passed
him in the hallway.

308
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,259
Hey you, stop!

309
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:02,929
Can you help me?

310
00:14:06,584 --> 00:14:07,847
McBride.

311
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:09,413
You really know
how to pick them.

312
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:12,199
Well, you know me,
I love a challenge.

313
00:14:12,373 --> 00:14:15,332
Especially when I think
the accused is innocent.

314
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:18,227
Where are you going?
Detective Marsh and I

315
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:20,207
are heading downtown to
meet with the captain.

316
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:22,576
Why? We need to make sure
that this high profile case

317
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,125
is handled carefully.
Captain wants to be apprised in person.

318
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:27,736
Captain afraid of getting
his image tarnished?

319
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,106
You know as well as I that the media is going to
be trying this case as we go.

320
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:30,957
Boy isn't that the truth?

321
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:33,220
Yeah.

322
00:14:33,394 --> 00:14:37,964
I'll let you guys get to it.
Thank you

323
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:40,140
Ready?

324
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:52,239
McBride Associates.

325
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:54,588
Hold on.

326
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:58,985
It's a reporter from
the National Informer.

327
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:01,465
I am in a very
important meeting.

328
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:03,903
Ah, he's in a very
important meeting.

329
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:05,774
Thank you.

330
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,228
Has that been happening a lot?

331
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:08,777
Ever since I
walked in the door.

332
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:10,213
Let the voicemail get it.

333
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:12,868
Marty Caine's murder
is big news, huh?

334
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:14,696
Oh, I talked to Wingy.

335
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,873
He said that the bail
situation is taken care of.

336
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:20,025
You've reached the offices of McBride and
Associates.

337
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:21,200
Great.
Please leave a message after the beep.

338
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:23,357
Oh.

339
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:25,185
Can I please call a temp agency?

340
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,490
Yes.

341
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:27,970
Tell them to send a Rottweiler.

342
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:29,144
Thank you.

343
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,689
It's certainly true
that money doesn't equate

344
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:34,716
to taste, does it?

345
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,809
Hi, we're here to
see Mrs. Caine.

346
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:43,943
Come in.

347
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,299
Mrs. Caine, I'm McBride.

348
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:55,041
My associate Phil Dewberry
Hello Mrs. Caine.

349
00:15:55,215 --> 00:15:57,391
Please come in.
Thank you.

350
00:15:57,565 --> 00:15:59,915
Can I get you
something to drink or?

351
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:03,614
No.
It's fine.

352
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:08,358
We appreciate you seeing us.
We'll try not to take
too much of your time.

353
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:11,231
How can I help?
Mrs. Caine, I hope you don't
mind my asking but,

354
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:13,059
how long were you
and Mr. Caine married?

355
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:15,409
It would have been
12 years next fall.

356
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,586
Very impressive.
Especially for Hollywood.
Well Marty was a big star

357
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,285
but when he came home to me he
would leave all that behind.

358
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:24,157
As I told you on the phone

359
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:25,811
the police believe
they have their man

360
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:27,899
but it is our opinion
he is innocent.

361
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:29,597
He publicly
threatened my husband.

362
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:32,165
He, he was caught
fleeing the scene

363
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:33,818
covered in my husband's blood.

364
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,082
Mrs. Caine, if I may,

365
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:39,563
there were no eye witnesses
to the actual assault.

366
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:42,131
What do you need to ask me?
There were a lot of people

367
00:16:42,305 --> 00:16:45,569
who had the opportunity
that night to

368
00:16:45,743 --> 00:16:47,484
kill your husband.

369
00:16:47,658 --> 00:16:48,809
The people who
work for the show,

370
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,531
all of the guests at the party.

371
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:52,968
I'm wondering if you
could think of any one

372
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:55,144
who might have a
motive to kill Marty?

373
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:56,624
Any one?

374
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:58,365
We're talking
about show business.

375
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:00,410
Um, afraid I don't follow.

376
00:17:00,584 --> 00:17:02,649
It's a cutthroat business.
There are some people who

377
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:05,459
it's not good enough to succeed.
They need their friends to fail.

378
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:08,073
That's why Marty was thinking
about getting out of television.

379
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:08,940
Retiring?

380
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:10,681
Politics

381
00:17:10,855 --> 00:17:12,615
Leaving one cutthroat
business for another?

382
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:16,426
Everybody was so upset.

383
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,298
Told them not to come in today.

384
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:20,256
I'm sure it was
a terrible shock.

385
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,692
I still can't believe it.

386
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:25,000
How long did you and
Marty work together?

387
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:27,959
Since Marty moved to Los
Angeles nearly 10 years ago.

388
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:31,180
When did you last see him?
I walked into his
office about six o'clock.

389
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:33,139
So energized, so focused.

390
00:17:33,313 --> 00:17:35,445
He wanted to talk new ideas
for the next 10 years,

391
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:37,273
but I told him to relax.

392
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:38,447
He'd had a tough show.

393
00:17:38,535 --> 00:17:39,667
You've seen it, right?

394
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:41,843
Yeah, we've seen it.

395
00:17:46,674 --> 00:17:49,372
Well, I'll let you two
do what you have to do.

396
00:17:49,546 --> 00:17:51,331
I've got to get back to work.

397
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:53,202
Showing reruns today.

398
00:17:53,376 --> 00:17:54,376
Thanks.

399
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:00,644
I thought Marty's wife said

400
00:18:00,818 --> 00:18:02,472
he was getting
out of television?

401
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:04,726
Well that wouldn't make
Arnie very happy, would it?

402
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:18,487
Ah.

403
00:18:19,837 --> 00:18:21,206
You all right?
I'll take the pictures.

404
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,580
No, no, no.
It's cool.

405
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:25,452
Lunch isn't sitting very well.

406
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:26,626
Right.

407
00:18:27,802 --> 00:18:29,499
Primarily this area we need.

408
00:18:29,673 --> 00:18:32,154
Fingerprints on the
chair, bloodstain.

409
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:34,722
We need pictures of
the doorknobs, too.

410
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:37,203
So you can dump those
on the computer,

411
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:39,596
and we can print out
all those photographs.

412
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:40,771
Oh hi.
Hi.

413
00:18:40,945 --> 00:18:41,729
Did you get everything you need?

414
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:43,992
Um, for now yes.

415
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,212
Do you have any idea
who might have wanted

416
00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:47,711
to do something
like this to Marty?

417
00:18:47,735 --> 00:18:48,815
No, everyone loved Marty.

418
00:18:48,953 --> 00:18:50,564
No professional jealousies?

419
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:52,000
None that I'm aware of.

420
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:53,480
Ah, what about the marriage?

421
00:18:53,654 --> 00:18:55,264
Are you kidding?

422
00:18:55,438 --> 00:18:57,310
Marty and Victoria were
like Rhett and Scarlet.

423
00:18:57,484 --> 00:18:58,635
Didn't he leave
her in the end?

424
00:18:58,659 --> 00:18:59,779
Well you know what I mean.

425
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:02,097
Like Rick and Ilsa, Casablanca.

426
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,423
Didn't she leave him in the
end?
Marty and Victoria were

427
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:06,406
an extremely devoted couple.

428
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,500
Right, I understand.
One thing that I will need

429
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:11,324
is a staff list of everybody
that worked on the show.

430
00:19:11,498 --> 00:19:13,587
And all the
guests at the party.

431
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:15,739
Right.
Well you're gonna have to wait
til my secretary gets back.

432
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:18,548
I press buttons on the
computer and the lights go out.

433
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:20,202
Thanks Arnie,
we'll be in touch.

434
00:19:20,376 --> 00:19:21,376
Okay.

435
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,776
So everybody just loved
Marty Caine, did they?

436
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,473
That's what the man said.

437
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:32,649
Yeah, but that's not
what Mrs. Caine said.

438
00:19:32,823 --> 00:19:34,738
It's true.

439
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:39,134
All right, so Marty was hit
on the back of the head.

440
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:40,962
Right.
Where he fell.

441
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:43,269
Fell over like he was
headed toward the bathroom.

442
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:46,228
Okay, what's your point?

443
00:19:46,402 --> 00:19:47,466
It's not what you'd
expect, tell me.

444
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,013
He's confronted by Joe

445
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,928
who's meant to be angry
enough to kill him.

446
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:52,602
Marty just turns
his back on him?
Marty was arrogant.

447
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:53,690
And clearly he was
arrogant enough to think

448
00:19:53,714 --> 00:19:55,803
that Joe wasn't a danger.

449
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:57,239
He walks away from Joe.

450
00:19:57,413 --> 00:19:59,110
And Joe what, brains
him with his own

451
00:19:59,285 --> 00:20:00,721
Viewer's Choice Award?

452
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:04,812
Yes, that's what
the DA's gonna claim.

453
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:09,208
Yeah.
It doesn't really pass the
smell test though, does it?

454
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:11,645
Marty Caine turned this back

455
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:13,492
because it never occurred
to him for a moment

456
00:20:13,516 --> 00:20:14,909
he was in any danger.

457
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,756
He walked away not
because he was arrogant.

458
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,825
Because he felt safe.

459
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,219
Which means what?

460
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:25,224
Marty Caine knew his killer.

461
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,752
Well, I don't know
how to thank you

462
00:20:31,926 --> 00:20:33,623
for securing my
bail, Mr. McBride

463
00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:35,712
Just help me prove
you're innocent.

464
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:38,517
Do you have a comment?
If you don't say anything,

465
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,581
they won't print anything.

466
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:42,415
Tracy?

467
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:44,155
Honey, I've always loved you.

468
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,250
I am really sorry about
that business with Eddie.

469
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:48,116
Honey, you broke my heart.

470
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,422
I know baby, I'm sorry.

471
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:51,554
But that's over.
You mean it?

472
00:20:51,728 --> 00:20:53,904
Joe, do you forgive Tracy?
Well I love her.

473
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:55,882
Tracy, does this
mean you accept Joe's...
You know what?

474
00:20:55,906 --> 00:20:58,474
We're not gonna answer any
more questions right now.

475
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:00,171
We'll talk to you
guys another time.

476
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:02,348
Give him some air, all right?
Thanks a lot.

477
00:21:02,522 --> 00:21:04,674
I'll give you a piece of advice.
Stay away from reporters.

478
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:06,395
They're not your friends.
Okay.

479
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:07,633
Just get home and I'll
call you in a while.

480
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:09,529
Okay, thanks again.

481
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:24,239
Wow, nice house.

482
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:25,477
Think he must be making
a little bit of money

483
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:26,633
working for Marty.

484
00:21:54,748 --> 00:21:56,358
Hi, Becky Tranter?

485
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:57,881
Forget it, okay?

486
00:21:58,055 --> 00:21:59,535
My name is McBride.
Are you Becky?

487
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:00,947
No, and she's not
doing any interviews.

488
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:02,408
Oh, we're we're not reporters.

489
00:22:02,582 --> 00:22:03,974
No we're lawyers.

490
00:22:04,148 --> 00:22:06,237
We represent the
gentleman who was accused

491
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:07,195
of killing Marty Caine.

492
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:08,675
My name's Phil.

493
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:10,285
Hey.

494
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:12,722
Um, we had a few
questions for Mrs. Tranter

495
00:22:12,896 --> 00:22:14,245
if that's cool with you?

496
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,421
She's out back.

497
00:22:15,595 --> 00:22:16,596
Cool.
May we?

498
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,770
Thank you.

499
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:25,387
I'm sorry.
I've gotta rush.

500
00:22:25,561 --> 00:22:26,973
I've got an important
audition I've got to go to.

501
00:22:26,997 --> 00:22:28,259
That's fine.
What's your name?

502
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:30,305
I'm Gina, Gina Carson.

503
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:31,630
Been friends with Becky long?

504
00:22:31,654 --> 00:22:32,814
We rent the place together.

505
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:35,528
Moved in about a year ago.

506
00:22:35,702 --> 00:22:36,862
This has really hit her hard.

507
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,226
Did you ever meet Mr. Caine?

508
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,883
A couple of times with Becky,

509
00:22:43,057 --> 00:22:46,060
Go easy on her.

510
00:22:57,637 --> 00:22:59,769
Becky Tranter,
my name's McBride.

511
00:22:59,943 --> 00:23:01,945
I'm a lawyer
representing Joe Devine.

512
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:03,730
Could we have a talk?

513
00:23:03,904 --> 00:23:06,863
It's my fault he's dead.

514
00:23:10,737 --> 00:23:12,826
I had a bunch of things to do.

515
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,654
I never thought, I mean,

516
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:17,744
you don't expect someone's
gonna come back and...

517
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,399
Take your time.

518
00:23:23,663 --> 00:23:25,795
I should have
checked, you know.

519
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:28,494
If I would have just checked,

520
00:23:28,668 --> 00:23:30,234
but instead I got distracted,

521
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,975
and I didn't follow up.

522
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:34,195
If I had done my job...

523
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:39,808
Thank you.

524
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:45,511
He seemed like a nice
enough guy before the show.

525
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,906
What happened after that?

526
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,475
I just finished up and
got ready for the party.

527
00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:55,521
And you saw Marty,
you say, at around,

528
00:23:55,695 --> 00:23:56,783
at 7:00 PM?

529
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,962
Marty was just
out of the shower.

530
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:06,880
Hey Becky.

531
00:24:07,054 --> 00:24:07,794
Hey.

532
00:24:07,968 --> 00:24:08,664
How you doing?

533
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:10,057
Good.

534
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:12,102
Entertainment Tonight called.

535
00:24:12,276 --> 00:24:13,819
Yeah?
They need to move the
interview to Tuesday.

536
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:15,628
They're bumping me, why?

537
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:18,413
They said something about
Cuba Gooding becoming available.

538
00:24:18,587 --> 00:24:19,936
Oh, oh Cuba Gooding.

539
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,110
Excuse me.

540
00:24:21,155 --> 00:24:22,765
They're very sorry.

541
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:24,898
So your conversation
was just about scheduling?

542
00:24:25,072 --> 00:24:27,466
Pretty much.
What's the real
message here, Becky?

543
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,427
What are they really saying?
That one lousy best supporting
actor beats my Emmy,

544
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:33,820
my five Golden Globes,

545
00:24:33,994 --> 00:24:36,518
my Viewer's Choice Award?

546
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:38,346
And do they think
that the alumni

547
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,956
at the University
of New Hampshire

548
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,524
just gives their
award to anyone?

549
00:24:42,698 --> 00:24:43,818
I'll be sure to tell them.

550
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,396
You do that.

551
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,053
Who cares, it's my night.

552
00:24:50,227 --> 00:24:51,227
Yeah.

553
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:54,797
Go, get ready for the party.

554
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:56,407
How long had you
worked for him?

555
00:24:56,582 --> 00:24:57,582
Eight years.

556
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:01,587
He knew my father
back in the old days,

557
00:25:01,761 --> 00:25:03,502
before Marty was famous.

558
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:06,287
We talked a bit about that, too.

559
00:25:12,598 --> 00:25:13,642
Hey.

560
00:25:13,816 --> 00:25:16,645
That, that was our first show.

561
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:19,039
My girlfriend is
hairier than I am.

562
00:25:20,127 --> 00:25:21,563
We've grown.

563
00:25:21,737 --> 00:25:24,740
Well, now here you
are 10 years later.

564
00:25:24,914 --> 00:25:25,611
Who would have thought it?

565
00:25:25,785 --> 00:25:26,785
Not me.

566
00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:28,439
Yeah.

567
00:25:28,614 --> 00:25:29,440
Dad either.

568
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:30,659
He should be here.

569
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:31,833
I know.

570
00:25:34,271 --> 00:25:36,622
See you at the party.

571
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:42,018
Did you see him
again after that?

572
00:25:42,192 --> 00:25:43,585
Not until they found him.

573
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:45,195
A 10 year run.

574
00:25:45,369 --> 00:25:46,969
Do you know how many
people achieve that?

575
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,417
It was going to be the
best night of his life.

576
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:50,591
My fault, you see.

577
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:51,811
I should have checked.

578
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,516
Mac, thanks for calling.

579
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,910
If you hadn't I'd have
gone hungry all night.

580
00:26:04,954 --> 00:26:08,088
Well, not exactly the corner
booth at Muso Frank's,

581
00:26:08,262 --> 00:26:10,786
but not the restaurant
that matters,

582
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,266
but the choice of company.

583
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,852
You always know
say the right thing.

584
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:15,225
What's got you working so late

585
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:16,594
flooding the captain
with paperwork?

586
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:18,054
Oh, this case is so hot.

587
00:26:18,228 --> 00:26:20,100
He wants me to
handle it personally.

588
00:26:21,188 --> 00:26:23,059
We've got to keep a
step ahead of the press

589
00:26:23,233 --> 00:26:24,495
or we'll have mud on our face.

590
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,497
Anything new?
Yeah.

591
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:28,592
You'll probably read it
in the tabloids tomorrow.

592
00:26:28,674 --> 00:26:30,110
Apparently the guy famous

593
00:26:30,284 --> 00:26:32,547
for bringing out the
worst in his guests

594
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:34,549
had a few extra marital
secrets of his own.

595
00:26:34,723 --> 00:26:36,266
Any new suspects?
We're working on it.

596
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,814
But what I don't
know is how you think

597
00:26:38,988 --> 00:26:41,469
that there's a way out
of this for your client.

598
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:42,643
You never know.

599
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:43,775
Could get lucky.

600
00:26:43,863 --> 00:26:45,604
Who knows, you might.

601
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,758
So the girl who
was with Marty that night,

602
00:26:49,782 --> 00:26:51,305
did she check in at reception?

603
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:54,003
Aaron said Marty
gave them all passes.

604
00:26:54,177 --> 00:26:55,807
You know what?
We've got to find out who she was.

605
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:58,791
Could be very important.

606
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,797
So what have we got here?

607
00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:07,930
We've got a wife who
wasn't too brokenhearted.

608
00:27:08,104 --> 00:27:10,759
Got a producer who
could get very angry.

609
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:12,302
Maybe if he thought
he was being dumped.

610
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:14,241
And several people with access.

611
00:27:17,723 --> 00:27:18,549
You know what might
be a good idea?

612
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:20,029
Make friends with Becky.

613
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:21,311
You know, Marty
Caine's assistant.

614
00:27:21,335 --> 00:27:22,375
She was very close to him.

615
00:27:22,423 --> 00:27:23,816
See what you can learn.

616
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,166
You mean like...
Just get close to her.

617
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,980
She's a contemporary.
So she'll probably open
up to you a lot sooner

618
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:30,083
than she would to me.

619
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,874
Oh, my word.

620
00:27:39,048 --> 00:27:40,702
31 messages.

621
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:42,116
Did you call the temp agency?

622
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:44,663
Yes.

623
00:27:44,837 --> 00:27:46,665
McBride and Associates.

624
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:48,710
Los Angeles Times?

625
00:27:48,884 --> 00:27:50,799
I'm sorry, he's in a deposition.

626
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:52,583
Thank you, goodbye.

627
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:54,020
McBride and Associates.

628
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:56,325
Uh huh.

629
00:27:56,413 --> 00:27:57,588
Hold the line, please.

630
00:27:57,763 --> 00:28:00,200
No, I'll tell Mr. McBride.

631
00:28:00,374 --> 00:28:02,115
10:00 AM on the fifth.

632
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:03,943
Yes, uh huh.

633
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:05,858
And does he have your number?

634
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:07,207
Thank you, goodbye.

635
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:10,645
Eugenie Underwood,
the agency sent me.

636
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:13,474
You know that works great
with filtered water.

637
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:15,868
You asked for Rottweiler.

638
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:17,042
Welcome.

639
00:28:28,054 --> 00:28:29,708
Hey, look, I
wanna talk to Arnie.

640
00:28:29,882 --> 00:28:31,579
You look around, see
if you can find Aaron.

641
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:32,753
Okay.

642
00:28:33,842 --> 00:28:36,627
Well I dressed Marty for
all his public appearances.

643
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:38,325
What was it like
working for him?

644
00:28:39,326 --> 00:28:40,414
He was exacting.

645
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:42,851
Exacting?

646
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:44,825
Yes, everything was
Marty had to be just so.

647
00:28:44,853 --> 00:28:46,594
He was meticulous
about his appearance.

648
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:48,335
The cashmere and silk suits.

649
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:50,032
The hundred percent
cotton shirts,

650
00:28:50,206 --> 00:28:51,730
all hand made, of course.

651
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:53,732
Monogrammed breast pocket.

652
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:55,777
Only rule was to
make Marty look good.

653
00:28:56,865 --> 00:28:58,258
How about Marty the man?

654
00:28:58,432 --> 00:28:59,955
How did he treat the
people around him?

655
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:02,088
The only role was to
make Marty look good.

656
00:29:06,396 --> 00:29:09,356
Marty Cain's wardrobe.

657
00:29:14,274 --> 00:29:17,320
You know, I noticed that
you keep the door locked.

658
00:29:17,494 --> 00:29:19,627
We've had some pilfering
of Marty's things.

659
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:22,171
You know, people are so
crazy to get their hands
on celebrity items.

660
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:24,937
I find it best to keep
temptation under lock and key.

661
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:26,677
Smart.
It's kind of weird thinking

662
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:29,332
he's never going to wear
any of these things again.

663
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:31,066
Aaron, the night
that Marty was killed

664
00:29:31,117 --> 00:29:32,224
Arnie said that you
brought him his suit

665
00:29:32,248 --> 00:29:33,380
earlier that evening.

666
00:29:33,554 --> 00:29:34,555
Yeah, that's right.

667
00:29:35,861 --> 00:29:36,861
Remember...

668
00:29:39,081 --> 00:29:39,908
what time exactly?

669
00:29:40,082 --> 00:29:41,823
It was about 6:30.

670
00:29:41,997 --> 00:29:44,217
And he wanted his
favorite Armani,

671
00:29:44,391 --> 00:29:47,350
which meant his white
Oxford button down.

672
00:29:47,524 --> 00:29:49,265
So you came in, you saw him,

673
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:51,093
and you gave him his suit?

674
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:53,071
No, I hung the suit and
the shirt on the coat rack,

675
00:29:53,095 --> 00:29:54,255
and I left the shoes beneath,

676
00:29:54,357 --> 00:29:56,751
and I left.

677
00:29:56,925 --> 00:29:58,927
Why didn't you just give
him his suit personally?

678
00:29:59,101 --> 00:30:02,365
Um, well because
Marty was entertaining

679
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:03,714
one of his lady friends,

680
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:05,804
and from the sound of things

681
00:30:05,978 --> 00:30:07,675
it wasn't really
time to interrupt.

682
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:09,851
You mean he was, they were...

683
00:30:10,025 --> 00:30:11,592
I don't know what I mean

684
00:30:11,766 --> 00:30:14,029
except that I know when
it's okay to bother Marty

685
00:30:14,203 --> 00:30:16,225
and I know it's not okay.
And when he's entertaining
one of his lady friends

686
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:18,773
and I hear giggling
coming from in the room

687
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:21,863
it's probably not the
best time to bother.
Giggling, really?

688
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:26,215
I don't know.
Maybe sex with Marty is
some kind of laugh riot.

689
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:28,696
How unusual was it for
Marty to be entertaining

690
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,848
a girl in his dressing
room like that after a show?

691
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:33,353
I wouldn't say it
was unusual exactly.

692
00:30:33,527 --> 00:30:35,268
What would you say exactly?

693
00:30:35,442 --> 00:30:37,966
Marty used to get, you know,
worked up after the show.

694
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,186
I guess he used that
to kind of relax.

695
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,842
Did you happen to see the
girl he was with that night?
No, no.

696
00:30:44,016 --> 00:30:46,714
He have any special girls?
Look, I don't know.

697
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:48,561
I didn't see them.
They were all the same to me.

698
00:30:48,585 --> 00:30:50,370
I just kept my head
down and I did my job,

699
00:30:50,544 --> 00:30:52,544
and keeping track of Marty's
extra marital liaisons

700
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:55,636
doesn't really fit my
job description, so.

701
00:31:01,642 --> 00:31:04,253
I still have
your handkerchief.
What?

702
00:31:04,427 --> 00:31:07,039
Yeah, you forgot
it the other day.

703
00:31:07,213 --> 00:31:08,779
Oh, I, I didn't
really forget it.

704
00:31:08,954 --> 00:31:11,434
I just thought it was a
bit un-chivalrous.

705
00:31:11,608 --> 00:31:12,914
Plus it was soaking wet.

706
00:31:13,088 --> 00:31:14,088
Yes it was.

707
00:31:16,178 --> 00:31:17,832
Do you want to grab a coffee?

708
00:31:18,006 --> 00:31:19,006
Sure.

709
00:31:20,443 --> 00:31:21,443
This way.
Oh.

710
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:31,324
This is the green room, huh?

711
00:31:33,108 --> 00:31:34,564
Gosh, I guess I imagined
it a little more,

712
00:31:34,588 --> 00:31:37,373
oh, I don't know, green.

713
00:31:37,547 --> 00:31:38,897
Inoffensive beige room

714
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:40,396
doesn't have the same
ring now does it?

715
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,812
No, it doesn't actually.

716
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:43,466
So you happen to know anything

717
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,096
about the woman who
was in Marty's office

718
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,426
the night he died?

719
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,600
No.

720
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:50,299
Well, I mean, yeah.

721
00:31:50,473 --> 00:31:54,129
I know he fooled around
behind his wife's back,

722
00:31:54,303 --> 00:31:56,131
but I never, I mean

723
00:31:56,305 --> 00:32:00,005
it wasn't something
that we talked about.

724
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:02,833
Thank you.

725
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:06,011
Don't ask, don't tell, huh?
Yeah.

726
00:32:06,185 --> 00:32:08,119
You didn't happen to know
who he was seeing recently

727
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:11,233
or first name, anything
he might've said?

728
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:12,407
Sorry.

729
00:32:13,322 --> 00:32:14,758
It's all right.

730
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,258
So I guess all this
means you're pretty much

731
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:17,282
out of a job now, huh?

732
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,501
Yeah.

733
00:32:18,675 --> 00:32:20,199
But it's Hollywood.

734
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:22,253
I'm sure something will turn up.
Here you are.

735
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:25,030
I've been looking
all over for you.
I'm coming.

736
00:32:25,204 --> 00:32:28,163
Look, I gotta go.
Going to check on the editing
now.

737
00:32:28,337 --> 00:32:31,297
McBride.

738
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:35,169
This won't take long.

739
00:32:35,257 --> 00:32:36,824
To tell you the truth

740
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:38,193
I was kind of hoping we
were through talking.

741
00:32:38,217 --> 00:32:39,783
Yeah.

742
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,352
Well I know that Marty was
thinking about quitting.

743
00:32:43,526 --> 00:32:44,875
So maybe he was quitting.

744
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:47,008
Maybe and so what?

745
00:32:47,182 --> 00:32:48,182
Well,

746
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:51,099
how'd you feel about that?

747
00:32:51,273 --> 00:32:52,273
In all honesty,

748
00:32:53,101 --> 00:32:54,320
it was time.

749
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:56,104
Why didn't you tell me?

750
00:32:56,278 --> 00:32:58,498
Well, because experience
has taught me to never

751
00:32:58,672 --> 00:33:02,197
tell people any more than
is strictly necessary.

752
00:33:02,371 --> 00:33:03,851
Especially when
being forthright.

753
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:07,202
It can lead to
unnecessary complications.

754
00:33:07,376 --> 00:33:08,638
Like what?

755
00:33:08,812 --> 00:33:10,379
Well, like you
mistakenly thinking

756
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:11,990
that I would be devastated

757
00:33:12,164 --> 00:33:14,296
by the fact that Marty
might be quitting,

758
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,864
and that I'd be angry over
the way he'd abandoned me

759
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:18,605
after all that I
had done for him.

760
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:21,347
Joe, let's try these on DVD.

761
00:33:23,392 --> 00:33:24,392
Were you?

762
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:25,699
Why should I be?

763
00:33:25,873 --> 00:33:27,440
We had a great run.
Nearly 10 years.

764
00:33:27,614 --> 00:33:29,920
Besides, I got development
deals all over the town.

765
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:31,575
Good for you.
Listen, Mr. McBride,

766
00:33:31,748 --> 00:33:33,620
you probably figured
out that Marty could be

767
00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:34,621
a pain in the neck,

768
00:33:34,795 --> 00:33:36,405
but I'm a producer,

769
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:38,427
and dealing with stars
who are a pain in the neck

770
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:40,540
is part of the job.

771
00:33:40,714 --> 00:33:42,542
And in case you
really need to ask me

772
00:33:42,716 --> 00:33:44,781
I can tell you exactly where
I was when Marty was murdered.

773
00:33:44,805 --> 00:33:46,546
Good.
'Cause I really to ask.

774
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,983
Well I was talking to the
network suits on the phone

775
00:33:49,157 --> 00:33:50,593
between 6:30 and 7:15.

776
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:52,508
You can check the phone records.

777
00:33:52,682 --> 00:33:53,682
I will.

778
00:33:58,427 --> 00:33:59,559
You know, McBride.

779
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,648
You're a smart lawyer.

780
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:05,434
You ever think about
doing a reality series

781
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:06,608
based on legal system?

782
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,784
We should talk.

783
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:09,395
Thank you, I don't think so.

784
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:10,265
Well, think about it.

785
00:34:10,439 --> 00:34:11,439
Just did.

786
00:34:19,796 --> 00:34:20,971
Hi.
Hi Becky.

787
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:22,146
Hi.

788
00:34:22,234 --> 00:34:23,235
I'll be in the Jeep.

789
00:34:24,671 --> 00:34:26,499
So, how's it going?

790
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,328
Are you a busy Friday?

791
00:34:29,502 --> 00:34:32,331
Maybe I can take you to a
movie or dinner or something?

792
00:34:32,505 --> 00:34:34,115
Yeah.

793
00:34:34,289 --> 00:34:35,290
Okay great.

794
00:34:35,464 --> 00:34:36,944
All right, bye.

795
00:34:44,473 --> 00:34:46,693
All right, so I
ingratiated myself.

796
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:48,260
You ask her out?
Yeah.

797
00:34:48,434 --> 00:34:49,672
Good, just remember...
I remember.

798
00:34:49,696 --> 00:34:52,699
Keep it professional.

799
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:58,008
No, no, no, I promised, yes.

800
00:34:58,183 --> 00:34:59,227
Yes, and I told him.

801
00:35:00,315 --> 00:35:01,969
Okay, uh huh.

802
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:03,143
Okay fine.

803
00:35:04,624 --> 00:35:07,105
Uh?
What's this all about?

804
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:09,735
Certainly glad she didn't like
my desk.
I'll tell them, thanks.

805
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:10,759
Hi.
Hi.

806
00:35:10,804 --> 00:35:12,501
You're in there.

807
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,461
Hey Jessie looks nice.

808
00:35:15,635 --> 00:35:16,853
Yeah.

809
00:35:17,027 --> 00:35:18,768
Doggy fluff and fold.
So?

810
00:35:18,942 --> 00:35:21,380
The Tribune wants to interview
you.
Not interested.

811
00:35:21,554 --> 00:35:23,434
There's a spot on court
TV if you're interested.

812
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,253
No, no, no, maybe Phil?
No, not me.

813
00:35:25,427 --> 00:35:27,342
Okay, WKZ is interested
in an in depth...

814
00:35:27,516 --> 00:35:29,083
Pass.
Okay.

815
00:35:29,257 --> 00:35:34,132
Where are the
crime scene photos?

816
00:35:34,306 --> 00:35:35,785
What about all the...

817
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:37,502
The statements,
forensics and court papers.

818
00:35:37,526 --> 00:35:39,049
Well, yeah.

819
00:35:39,224 --> 00:35:41,356
Actually how did you know
I was gonna say that?

820
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,530
Nice job.

821
00:35:50,626 --> 00:35:52,411
So, now that we're organized,

822
00:35:52,585 --> 00:35:55,196
let's get back to it.

823
00:35:56,415 --> 00:35:58,480
Any luck on phone records?
Uh, they called and said

824
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:00,375
they'll have them to me
in the morning.

825
00:36:00,549 --> 00:36:02,658
Okay, fine.
Anybody on that production
staff over there

826
00:36:02,682 --> 00:36:05,206
profess any knowledge
of Marty's girlfriends?

827
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,879
Oh it's, you know,
one of those things

828
00:36:06,903 --> 00:36:08,103
where everybody knows about it

829
00:36:08,253 --> 00:36:09,360
but nobody's talking about it.

830
00:36:09,384 --> 00:36:10,384
Yeah well...

831
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:13,519
Okay, to do list for
the rest of the day.

832
00:36:13,693 --> 00:36:15,390
I'd like you to
go over to Joe's.

833
00:36:16,478 --> 00:36:20,134
Just, um, kind
of reiterate with him
the points of the statement.

834
00:36:20,308 --> 00:36:22,634
He could probably use
a little hand holding
right now anyway.

835
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:24,201
You gonna be here the
rest of the afternoon?
No, I wanna go have

836
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:25,594
another conversation
with Victoria Caine.

837
00:36:25,618 --> 00:36:27,141
Obviously things weren't as rosy

838
00:36:27,315 --> 00:36:29,361
between her and Marty
as she led us to believe.

839
00:36:29,535 --> 00:36:30,231
Um hum.

840
00:36:30,405 --> 00:36:32,102
Um hum.

841
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,500
I've been finding out
some interesting things

842
00:36:38,674 --> 00:36:39,674
about Mr. Caine.

843
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:41,763
And?

844
00:36:45,594 --> 00:36:47,814
Well, to be blunt
it doesn't seem

845
00:36:49,468 --> 00:36:52,297
he's what one would
call a faithful husband.

846
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:55,299
I know.

847
00:36:58,477 --> 00:37:00,305
So you didn't have
a happy marriage?

848
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:03,438
I had a marriage that worked.

849
00:37:04,396 --> 00:37:07,225
Look, a lot of women let
that sort of thing go by

850
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:09,444
when they're married
to a successful man.

851
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:13,579
The only thing that mattered
was that Marty came home to me.

852
00:37:15,842 --> 00:37:17,670
Do you wanna get that?

853
00:37:17,844 --> 00:37:20,499
No, I, I don't really want
to speak to anyone right now.

854
00:37:23,893 --> 00:37:25,286
Did it hurt?

855
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,505
Of course it hurt.

856
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,247
Truth is it hurts as much now

857
00:37:29,421 --> 00:37:32,685
as when I first found out
about it five years ago.

858
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:34,556
Why did you stay with him?

859
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:38,865
Because I loved him.

860
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:40,479
If you don't mind
I would really like

861
00:37:40,562 --> 00:37:42,434
to just be alone
right now, please.

862
00:37:43,348 --> 00:37:44,348
Certainly.

863
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,360
Joe, what time was it that
you went back into the studio?

864
00:38:19,384 --> 00:38:20,863
You okay baby?

865
00:38:21,037 --> 00:38:22,474
As long as I've got you.

866
00:38:22,648 --> 00:38:23,842
Oh, now don't
you move a muscle.

867
00:38:23,866 --> 00:38:25,564
I'll get that.
Okay.

868
00:38:28,697 --> 00:38:31,178
Hello?
Man, I'll tell you the
phone's been ringing off

869
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:32,440
the hook since we got home.

870
00:38:32,614 --> 00:38:33,789
Really?
Yeah.

871
00:38:33,963 --> 00:38:35,313
Got offers coming in all over.

872
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:36,618
She got herself an agent.

873
00:38:39,665 --> 00:38:41,275
He's talking about
booking studio time.

874
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:43,369
You know, when she's got
her set fully developed,

875
00:38:43,451 --> 00:38:44,452
you know, fine tuned.

876
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:47,803
This trial has
been like the best

877
00:38:47,977 --> 00:38:49,588
thing that could've
happened to us.

878
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:51,633
It's really made Tracy
and me understand

879
00:38:51,807 --> 00:38:53,374
how much we truly
love each other,

880
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:55,028
in sickness and in health,

881
00:38:55,202 --> 00:38:57,291
for better or worse,
for richer for poorer.

882
00:38:57,465 --> 00:39:01,600
Joseph, you are
on trial for murder.

883
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:03,428
Yeah, but I'm innocent,

884
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:05,212
and you guys are
the best, right?

885
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:07,823
Okay, sometimes
that's not enough.

886
00:39:07,997 --> 00:39:08,824
Like right now.

887
00:39:08,998 --> 00:39:10,391
What do you mean?

888
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:11,934
Joe, I think you
need to just lay low

889
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:13,398
and stop taking this
all for granted.

890
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:14,893
If you're trying
to scare me, Phil,

891
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:16,266
you're doing a
heck of a good job.

892
00:39:16,441 --> 00:39:17,833
I'm not trying to scare you.

893
00:39:18,007 --> 00:39:19,607
I'm trying to give
you a dose of reality.

894
00:39:19,705 --> 00:39:21,117
This trial, this case
is not good for Tracy

895
00:39:21,141 --> 00:39:22,621
and it's especially
not good for you.

896
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:48,429
Hi, Eugenia, McBride.

897
00:39:48,603 --> 00:39:49,972
Listen, I'm going to be
out here a lot longer

898
00:39:49,996 --> 00:39:51,214
than I thought.

899
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,868
So could you hang
around, please?

900
00:39:53,042 --> 00:39:54,653
Keep Jesse company and feed him?

901
00:39:56,045 --> 00:39:58,918
Yes, no, no, I will, I promise.

902
00:39:59,092 --> 00:40:00,310
I'll be back as soon as I can.

903
00:40:00,485 --> 00:40:02,312
If you could just do that.

904
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:03,096
All right, good.

905
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,010
Thank you.

906
00:40:04,184 --> 00:40:05,185
Yes, I promise.

907
00:42:25,064 --> 00:42:26,868
Okay, Joe.
I'll go ahead and
get this typed up

908
00:42:26,892 --> 00:42:28,732
and then we can
go over it again.
Sounds good.

909
00:42:28,894 --> 00:42:30,534
I'm just saying if people
are showing up

910
00:42:30,635 --> 00:42:32,090
becuase of me then I think it's
only fair

911
00:42:32,114 --> 00:42:33,855
that I get a slice
of the pie, too.

912
00:42:34,029 --> 00:42:35,944
Take care, Joe.
Hey, thanks Phil.

913
00:42:36,118 --> 00:42:38,686
And please tell Mr. McBride
how grateful me and Tracy are.

914
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,166
Sure.
I don't care.

915
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,081
I mean it's either
that or I walk.

916
00:43:43,229 --> 00:43:44,229
Bye baby.

917
00:43:47,102 --> 00:43:49,888
I'll talk to you later.

918
00:44:08,036 --> 00:44:09,559
What, did you forget your...

919
00:44:09,734 --> 00:44:10,822
Hello Aaron.

920
00:44:18,917 --> 00:44:19,613
Hello?

921
00:44:19,787 --> 00:44:20,832
Hi Becky.

922
00:44:21,006 --> 00:44:22,529
Hey, it's Phil.
Oh hey.

923
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:24,028
I was just calling
to confirm for tonight.

924
00:44:24,052 --> 00:44:25,053
Well...

925
00:44:25,227 --> 00:44:26,881
C'mon, need a nice night out.

926
00:44:27,055 --> 00:44:29,841
I really just don't
think it would be much fun.

927
00:44:30,015 --> 00:44:32,234
Just a little dinner and
some good conversation.

928
00:44:32,408 --> 00:44:34,236
Okay, 7:00 PM?

929
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:35,890
Great, pick you up.

930
00:44:36,064 --> 00:44:37,239
Okay great.
Great.

931
00:44:37,413 --> 00:44:38,676
I'll see a little later.

932
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:39,677
See you then.

933
00:44:39,851 --> 00:44:40,851
Bye.
Bye.

934
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,792
How long you been seeing her?
I don't think that's
any of your business.

935
00:44:48,816 --> 00:44:51,906
You know something,
when I've got a client
facing the death penalty

936
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:57,651
everything is my business.

937
00:44:57,825 --> 00:45:00,959
Nearly two years.

938
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:03,415
So the night of the murder
you brought Marty his clothes.

939
00:45:03,439 --> 00:45:04,439
Then what?

940
00:45:05,354 --> 00:45:07,154
Well I finish up a few
things and I go home.

941
00:45:07,313 --> 00:45:09,402
You didn't go to the party?
No, no.

942
00:45:09,576 --> 00:45:12,971
I wasn't really in the mood
to celebrate Marty's
achievements.

943
00:45:13,145 --> 00:45:14,973
Anybody see you leave
the studio that night?

944
00:45:15,147 --> 00:45:17,147
I don't know.
Maybe a security
guard in the lobby.

945
00:45:17,279 --> 00:45:18,822
Did Marty know about
you and Victoria?

946
00:45:18,846 --> 00:45:21,588
We kept it a
secret from everyone.

947
00:45:21,762 --> 00:45:23,982
You know what
Marty did, though.
That just like,

948
00:45:24,156 --> 00:45:25,897
clears the
way for you, doesn't it?

949
00:45:26,071 --> 00:45:28,092
You really think this is
something we cooked up together?

950
00:45:28,116 --> 00:45:29,596
Oh, hey that's
a good question.

951
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:30,249
Thanks for bringing it up.

952
00:45:30,423 --> 00:45:31,423
Did you?

953
00:45:31,511 --> 00:45:32,511
Don't be ridiculous.

954
00:45:34,819 --> 00:45:36,342
Good night, Mr. McBride.

955
00:45:36,516 --> 00:45:38,823
You know, I just have
this tingly feeling

956
00:45:38,997 --> 00:45:40,085
we'll be talking again.

957
00:45:54,142 --> 00:45:54,969
Well.

958
00:45:55,143 --> 00:45:55,927
Hi.

959
00:45:56,101 --> 00:45:56,928
How are you?

960
00:45:57,102 --> 00:45:58,102
I'm good, how are you?

961
00:45:58,146 --> 00:45:58,973
You look very nice.

962
00:45:59,147 --> 00:46:00,148
Thank you.

963
00:46:00,322 --> 00:46:01,802
So do you.
Thanks.

964
00:46:02,977 --> 00:46:03,977
Nice jacket.

965
00:46:04,022 --> 00:46:05,022
Thank you.

966
00:46:05,066 --> 00:46:06,807
It's my it's my dad's.

967
00:46:06,981 --> 00:46:08,113
He's dead.

968
00:46:11,856 --> 00:46:14,684
I was born to it, I suppose.

969
00:46:14,859 --> 00:46:16,251
What, TV?

970
00:46:16,425 --> 00:46:17,600
My dad was...

971
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,733
Eddie Tranter, I know.

972
00:46:19,907 --> 00:46:22,083
Wow, you've been
doing your homework.

973
00:46:22,257 --> 00:46:23,257
It's my job.

974
00:46:24,259 --> 00:46:27,306
I know that your dad and
Marty were partners once.

975
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,395
Yeah, I've known
Marty my whole life.

976
00:46:31,179 --> 00:46:33,094
My mom died when I was a baby.

977
00:46:33,268 --> 00:46:34,835
Dad raised me on his own.

978
00:46:35,009 --> 00:46:36,402
He was a producer.

979
00:46:36,576 --> 00:46:39,187
A bit like Arnie,
only with morals.

980
00:46:39,361 --> 00:46:40,972
And Marty was the talent.

981
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:45,019
They started out at a local
cable station in Michigan,

982
00:46:45,193 --> 00:46:48,370
and right from the start it
was clear Marty was a star.

983
00:46:48,544 --> 00:46:50,111
And it wasn't too
long after that

984
00:46:50,285 --> 00:46:52,374
that the suits out here
started to take notice.

985
00:46:52,548 --> 00:46:54,202
Out you came, huh?

986
00:46:54,376 --> 00:46:55,376
Marty came.

987
00:46:56,509 --> 00:46:57,858
Dad didn't want to leave.

988
00:46:58,032 --> 00:46:59,860
He didn't want to move me.

989
00:47:00,034 --> 00:47:04,909
So he stayed and Marty became
a big star in five minutes.

990
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:06,582
Of course we ended up
coming out here in the end.

991
00:47:06,606 --> 00:47:09,696
But by then dad was
feeling really bad

992
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,959
about himself and drinking.

993
00:47:12,133 --> 00:47:13,961
I mean, there was Marty
all over TV Guide,

994
00:47:14,135 --> 00:47:16,355
and dad couldn't get arrested.

995
00:47:16,529 --> 00:47:18,089
Why didn't he just
ask Marty for help?

996
00:47:18,226 --> 00:47:19,358
Oh he wouldn't do that.

997
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:22,752
Marty told me he offered
to help countless times

998
00:47:22,927 --> 00:47:24,363
but dad didn't want charity.

999
00:47:25,973 --> 00:47:28,149
One morning when I was 18,

1000
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:31,500
I left to pick up
some groceries.

1001
00:47:33,154 --> 00:47:34,373
Dad was in a good mood.

1002
00:47:35,983 --> 00:47:38,203
I had just given him
a recording he wanted.

1003
00:47:39,465 --> 00:47:42,207
Kathleen Ferrier in
Orpheus and Eurydice.

1004
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:44,599
You know it?

1005
00:47:46,254 --> 00:47:48,735
I'm more of an R
and B kind of guy.

1006
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:50,955
Yeah well, dad loved it.

1007
00:47:52,086 --> 00:47:55,133
He said it was about
being lost and then found.

1008
00:47:55,307 --> 00:47:57,570
I got back about
a half hour later,

1009
00:48:00,225 --> 00:48:02,053
and the music was blaring out.

1010
00:48:03,271 --> 00:48:05,143
The window was open and

1011
00:48:07,058 --> 00:48:10,800
there was dad lying
face down in the street.

1012
00:48:10,975 --> 00:48:12,324
We were eight stories up.

1013
00:48:12,498 --> 00:48:13,978
He fell?

1014
00:48:14,152 --> 00:48:15,152
No.

1015
00:48:16,154 --> 00:48:17,764
The coroner said
there was no way,

1016
00:48:17,938 --> 00:48:20,506
something about the
height of the window.

1017
00:48:22,247 --> 00:48:23,770
No, he jumped.

1018
00:48:23,944 --> 00:48:25,903
When he heard, Marty
was devastated.

1019
00:48:26,077 --> 00:48:27,730
He felt terrible.

1020
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:31,169
Said he should have made
more of an effort to see dad.

1021
00:48:31,343 --> 00:48:34,085
And then afterward
he stepped right up.

1022
00:48:34,259 --> 00:48:35,869
He took me under his wing,

1023
00:48:36,043 --> 00:48:37,523
gave me a job at the show.

1024
00:48:39,481 --> 00:48:41,483
It was like he'd
never been away.

1025
00:48:41,657 --> 00:48:42,963
Becky I'm...

1026
00:48:44,008 --> 00:48:45,008
I'm really sorry.

1027
00:48:55,149 --> 00:48:56,150
Hi.

1028
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:00,391
I need a break.
I figured if I just called you,
you would have said no.

1029
00:49:00,502 --> 00:49:03,201
I want to take Jessie to the dog
park so he can

1030
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:05,464
flirt with a
certain female Chihuahua.

1031
00:49:05,638 --> 00:49:06,958
Why don't you take
a walk with me.

1032
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:08,336
Okay.

1033
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:09,510
You're right.

1034
00:49:15,517 --> 00:49:16,518
Got your Glock?

1035
00:49:28,574 --> 00:49:30,141
My lady.

1036
00:49:30,315 --> 00:49:31,011
Thank you.

1037
00:49:31,185 --> 00:49:32,491
You're welcome.

1038
00:49:34,014 --> 00:49:34,797
I had a good time.

1039
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,712
Me too.

1040
00:49:38,236 --> 00:49:42,066
You okay?
I noticed at dinner you
were kind of scratching...

1041
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,068
I have a skin condition.

1042
00:49:44,242 --> 00:49:46,113
It's a rash.

1043
00:49:46,287 --> 00:49:47,854
I get it sometimes when I'm...

1044
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:49,028
Stressed?
Yeah.

1045
00:49:51,771 --> 00:49:53,749
Well it's not surprising
considering all
you've been through.

1046
00:49:53,773 --> 00:49:55,340
I have a special
cream the doc gave me

1047
00:49:55,514 --> 00:49:58,343
but it doesn't seem to be
doing me much good, so.

1048
00:49:59,431 --> 00:50:00,736
Pretty gross, huh?

1049
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:03,391
No, I actually had
this weird twitch

1050
00:50:03,565 --> 00:50:05,089
in my right lower lid.

1051
00:50:05,263 --> 00:50:06,623
And it's gotten
significantly worse

1052
00:50:06,742 --> 00:50:08,440
since I started
working for McBride.

1053
00:50:09,571 --> 00:50:11,182
Thank you, Phil.

1054
00:50:11,356 --> 00:50:13,358
Thank you for indulging
me and making me laugh.

1055
00:50:13,532 --> 00:50:14,620
It's what I do.

1056
00:50:19,233 --> 00:50:21,192
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

1057
00:50:28,373 --> 00:50:29,591
You followed me.

1058
00:50:29,765 --> 00:50:30,984
That was very sneaky.

1059
00:50:38,165 --> 00:50:41,212
My affair with Aaron has nothing
to do with Marty's murder.

1060
00:50:41,386 --> 00:50:43,344
The oldest motive
in the world.

1061
00:50:43,518 --> 00:50:45,042
What do you want from me?

1062
00:50:45,216 --> 00:50:46,521
I'd like to know
where you were

1063
00:50:46,695 --> 00:50:48,393
just before Marty's
body was found.

1064
00:50:48,567 --> 00:50:49,567
At the party.

1065
00:50:49,698 --> 00:50:51,135
And who saw you there?

1066
00:50:51,309 --> 00:50:54,181
Almost everybody.
Right, 10 years.

1067
00:50:54,355 --> 00:50:55,791
Enviable run on television.

1068
00:50:55,965 --> 00:50:57,160
It must have been a
very exciting party

1069
00:50:57,184 --> 00:50:57,967
for everyone involved.

1070
00:50:58,142 --> 00:50:59,882
I'm sure it was.

1071
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,972
So it's possible you slipped
away for a few minutes.

1072
00:51:03,147 --> 00:51:04,452
No one would even notice.

1073
00:51:04,626 --> 00:51:06,150
Yes, I could've, but I didn't.

1074
00:51:06,324 --> 00:51:07,518
Let's just cut to
the chase here.

1075
00:51:07,542 --> 00:51:09,109
If I wanted to kill my husband

1076
00:51:09,283 --> 00:51:11,329
who took very good care of me,

1077
00:51:11,503 --> 00:51:13,505
you really think that I
would do it at a party

1078
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:16,421
surrounded by 50 of
his closest associates?

1079
00:51:18,858 --> 00:51:20,098
If you have any more questions,

1080
00:51:20,164 --> 00:51:21,774
please just call my lawyer.

1081
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,277
Hey.

1082
00:51:46,451 --> 00:51:47,930
How'd it go with
Victoria Caine?

1083
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:52,283
Well, she is one smart woman.
And tough.

1084
00:51:52,457 --> 00:51:55,373
Yeah, I guess you'd have to be
to be live with Marty
all those years.

1085
00:52:00,204 --> 00:52:01,248
What's that?

1086
00:52:01,422 --> 00:52:02,582
Oh, this is the phone list.

1087
00:52:02,728 --> 00:52:04,338
Oh Arnie's?

1088
00:52:04,512 --> 00:52:05,731
Yes.

1089
00:52:05,905 --> 00:52:07,646
And did you see
on the next page.

1090
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:11,389
6:23 he made a phone call
that lasted 47 minutes.

1091
00:52:11,563 --> 00:52:14,218
So guess he's off
the suspect list.
You think so?

1092
00:52:14,392 --> 00:52:16,112
Well, it's a pretty
solid alibi, isn't it?

1093
00:52:16,263 --> 00:52:17,569
Ever put anybody on hold?

1094
00:52:17,743 --> 00:52:18,894
I don't think a
producer would dare

1095
00:52:18,918 --> 00:52:20,963
put a network executive on hold.

1096
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,356
No?
No.

1097
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:24,663
Phone protocol in
Hollywood is a,

1098
00:52:24,837 --> 00:52:26,404
it's not a game.

1099
00:52:26,578 --> 00:52:28,406
There's a real pecking
order as to who gets

1100
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,321
to do what to whom.

1101
00:52:30,495 --> 00:52:33,106
Anything come for
me from the police?
Police?

1102
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,953
Detective Marsh said that
he was going to send me a list

1103
00:52:34,977 --> 00:52:36,085
of all the stuff that was
in Marty Caine's office

1104
00:52:36,109 --> 00:52:37,328
the night he got murdered.

1105
00:52:37,502 --> 00:52:38,677
No, nothing's come yet.

1106
00:52:41,245 --> 00:52:42,681
Can we do
something about that?

1107
00:52:44,378 --> 00:52:45,727
Who do you think you are!

1108
00:52:45,901 --> 00:52:47,207
I'll kill you!

1109
00:52:49,427 --> 00:52:51,361
Well, I mean, they're
convicting him on television

1110
00:52:51,385 --> 00:52:52,821
before the trial's even started.

1111
00:52:54,214 --> 00:52:56,085
I had no idea he
had such passion.

1112
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,652
Such rage,

1113
00:52:57,826 --> 00:52:59,611
such intense love for me.

1114
00:53:01,569 --> 00:53:03,397
She is a piece
of work, isn't she?

1115
00:53:04,355 --> 00:53:06,313
The boyfriend is
up on a murder rap.

1116
00:53:07,532 --> 00:53:08,837
And she's promoting herself.

1117
00:53:13,668 --> 00:53:16,280
Hey Mac.
What brings you by?

1118
00:53:16,454 --> 00:53:18,693
Well, I've been looking
for Detective Marsh.
I can't find him.

1119
00:53:18,717 --> 00:53:20,632
He was supposed to send
me an inventory list

1120
00:53:20,806 --> 00:53:23,374
of all the stuff in
the Marty Caine office.

1121
00:53:23,548 --> 00:53:25,419
I haven't gotten it yet.
You know what?

1122
00:53:25,593 --> 00:53:27,378
I haven't seen him in a bit.

1123
00:53:27,552 --> 00:53:28,727
Let me see what I can do.

1124
00:53:31,512 --> 00:53:33,340
This is Detective Hansen.

1125
00:53:33,514 --> 00:53:34,839
Can I get the crime
scene inventory

1126
00:53:34,863 --> 00:53:36,517
for the Marty Caine murder case?

1127
00:53:38,432 --> 00:53:39,128
It'll be right up.

1128
00:53:39,303 --> 00:53:39,912
Groovy.

1129
00:53:40,086 --> 00:53:40,739
Your desk.

1130
00:53:40,913 --> 00:53:42,306
Thank you.

1131
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,395
I know Marsh is
swamped with all of this

1132
00:53:44,569 --> 00:53:45,894
but I should have had that
list quite a while ago.

1133
00:53:45,918 --> 00:53:46,919
I'm getting behind here.

1134
00:53:47,093 --> 00:53:48,442
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

1135
00:53:48,616 --> 00:53:50,270
Marsh should have
had it right away.

1136
00:53:50,444 --> 00:53:51,184
I'm sure the captain
wouldn't wanna lose this case

1137
00:53:51,358 --> 00:53:52,141
on a technicality.

1138
00:53:52,316 --> 00:53:53,360
No, he wouldn't.

1139
00:53:53,534 --> 00:53:54,555
You will have full disclosure.

1140
00:53:54,579 --> 00:53:55,579
Here you go, ma'am.

1141
00:53:56,494 --> 00:53:57,538
Thanks Channel.

1142
00:53:58,626 --> 00:54:00,106
Mr. McBride.

1143
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,239
Anything else I can do for you?

1144
00:54:02,413 --> 00:54:04,328
No, this is what I needed.

1145
00:54:04,502 --> 00:54:05,285
Thank you.

1146
00:54:05,459 --> 00:54:06,852
That's a switch.

1147
00:54:21,649 --> 00:54:22,649
What's up?

1148
00:54:22,737 --> 00:54:24,478
How's it going over here?

1149
00:54:24,652 --> 00:54:25,871
Will take a while, yeah.

1150
00:54:26,045 --> 00:54:29,483
73 paperclips 23
scripts, 16 pens.

1151
00:54:29,657 --> 00:54:31,592
It sounds like we don't know
exactly what we're looking for.

1152
00:54:31,616 --> 00:54:35,663
No. I was hoping that if I
come across something that...

1153
00:54:35,837 --> 00:54:37,143
Marty's shirt.
What?

1154
00:54:37,317 --> 00:54:40,407
His shirt, white
monogram shirt.

1155
00:54:40,581 --> 00:54:43,845
Right?
Aaron pressed the shirt and
brought it in with the suit

1156
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:47,327
At 6:35, right?

1157
00:54:47,501 --> 00:54:49,851
Said he walked in the office,

1158
00:54:50,025 --> 00:54:53,202
hangs the suit on the coat
rack outside the dressing room.

1159
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:54,595
So?

1160
00:54:54,769 --> 00:54:55,769
Come here.

1161
00:55:00,035 --> 00:55:01,428
So where is it?

1162
00:55:01,602 --> 00:55:02,255
No mention of a
shirt on this list.

1163
00:55:02,429 --> 00:55:04,126
Black suit shoes.

1164
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:08,174
So between the time Aaron
hung the suit on the coat rack

1165
00:55:08,348 --> 00:55:10,568
and that picture was taken,
the shirt disappeared.

1166
00:55:10,742 --> 00:55:14,267
So you think the killer
took it maybe as a souvenir?

1167
00:55:14,441 --> 00:55:15,442
So much blood.

1168
00:55:15,616 --> 00:55:16,854
I mean Joe was covered in blood.

1169
00:55:16,878 --> 00:55:18,576
He barely touched the body.

1170
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:21,361
The killer must've gotten
blood all over his shirt.

1171
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:25,017
You can't go prancing around
town wearing a bloody shirt.

1172
00:55:27,976 --> 00:55:30,936
So you think the killer
put on Marty's shirt?

1173
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:34,287
Yeah.
Then it's just a question of
getting away from the scene

1174
00:55:34,461 --> 00:55:35,897
and getting rid of
the bloody shirt.

1175
00:55:36,071 --> 00:55:38,247
What did he do with
Marty's clean shirt?

1176
00:55:38,422 --> 00:55:39,248
He get rid of it the same time?

1177
00:55:39,423 --> 00:55:40,641
No, can't do that.

1178
00:55:40,815 --> 00:55:41,966
Why not?
You wear it again.

1179
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:43,557
That would mean going shirtless.

1180
00:55:43,731 --> 00:55:44,926
But then you show
up at your house

1181
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:45,970
and you've got Marty's shirt.

1182
00:55:45,994 --> 00:55:46,995
What are you going to do?

1183
00:55:47,169 --> 00:55:47,822
Stick in your own trash can?

1184
00:55:47,996 --> 00:55:48,996
That's a liability.

1185
00:55:49,607 --> 00:55:51,043
How do you get
rid of something

1186
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,481
if you don't want anyone
ever to be able to find it?

1187
00:55:54,655 --> 00:55:56,353
Probably burn it.
Uh huh.

1188
00:55:56,527 --> 00:55:58,548
Only it's late at night
when the killer gets home.

1189
00:55:58,572 --> 00:55:59,932
He can't exactly
start a fire then.

1190
00:56:00,008 --> 00:56:01,532
That's kind of,
you know, obvious.

1191
00:56:01,706 --> 00:56:03,011
Right?

1192
00:56:03,185 --> 00:56:04,625
So he waits until
the next morning.

1193
00:56:04,752 --> 00:56:06,537
Disguises the shirt
as something else.

1194
00:56:06,711 --> 00:56:07,929
And he burns it.

1195
00:56:08,103 --> 00:56:09,453
Good deduction.
The old saying,

1196
00:56:09,627 --> 00:56:11,542
hide a letter,
put it in the mailbox.

1197
00:56:11,716 --> 00:56:13,215
So if you're gonna
do it in plain sight

1198
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:16,764
it has to look like
a simple everyday,

1199
00:56:16,938 --> 00:56:19,376
like burning garden waste.

1200
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:20,986
Like Becky was doing.

1201
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,727
Marty was like a
second father to her.

1202
00:56:22,901 --> 00:56:24,642
I know.
You gonna see her again?

1203
00:56:24,816 --> 00:56:26,228
Tonight.
Check out her barbecue.
Mac!

1204
00:56:26,252 --> 00:56:28,254
Phillip, everybody
is a suspect.

1205
00:56:28,428 --> 00:56:31,779
Check out the barbecue,
see that it was just
twigs and leaves.

1206
00:56:31,953 --> 00:56:33,738
That way we check
her off the list.

1207
00:56:39,657 --> 00:56:41,354
Do you have an
interview already?

1208
00:56:41,528 --> 00:56:43,463
Yeah. They figured if I could
take care of Marty,

1209
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:45,358
I could take care of anyone.

1210
00:56:45,532 --> 00:56:47,055
Wow, that's great.

1211
00:56:47,229 --> 00:56:50,885
You know, I'm going
to get another bottle.

1212
00:57:27,182 --> 00:57:30,142
Looks like cotton.

1213
00:57:36,191 --> 00:57:37,976
Could be a white shirt.

1214
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:42,328
Could be.

1215
00:57:42,502 --> 00:57:43,895
Okay, well

1216
00:57:44,069 --> 00:57:48,073
just get it to the lab.

1217
00:57:52,251 --> 00:57:54,359
You really think Becky did it?
Just wait till we get the

1218
00:57:54,383 --> 00:57:57,691
report from the lab, okay?
There could be a
simple explanation.

1219
00:57:57,865 --> 00:58:00,825
For all we know
Victoria, Arnie, Aaron,

1220
00:58:00,999 --> 00:58:02,435
half the staff burn things.

1221
00:58:02,609 --> 00:58:05,830
We just didn't happen
to see them do it.

1222
00:58:06,004 --> 00:58:09,007
Doesn't make me
feel any better.

1223
00:58:09,181 --> 00:58:11,183
Didn't think it would.

1224
00:58:11,618 --> 00:58:14,926
So around 6:30 you brought
Marty his clothes for party?

1225
00:58:16,057 --> 00:58:19,147
Yes, I brought him his
shirt, suit and shoes.

1226
00:58:19,321 --> 00:58:21,909
Are you sure that you had the
shirt with you that evening?
Yes.

1227
00:58:21,933 --> 00:58:23,563
Did you personally give
Marty his clothes that night?

1228
00:58:23,587 --> 00:58:25,023
Ah, well no.

1229
00:58:25,197 --> 00:58:28,940
When I got there,
he was occupied.

1230
00:58:29,114 --> 00:58:30,289
So I,

1231
00:58:31,725 --> 00:58:33,771
I put the shirt and the
suit on the coat rack

1232
00:58:33,945 --> 00:58:36,643
and lay the shoes
beneath to the side.

1233
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:40,560
You put the suit and
the shirt on the coatrack?

1234
00:58:40,734 --> 00:58:41,518
Correct.

1235
00:58:41,692 --> 00:58:44,608
Nothing further.

1236
00:58:44,782 --> 00:58:46,610
As you can see, sir,
from the inventory

1237
00:58:46,784 --> 00:58:48,655
there is indeed no
mention of the shirts.

1238
00:58:48,829 --> 00:58:53,921
Seems that way.
Did you look for
the missing shirt?

1239
00:58:54,095 --> 00:58:55,749
Detective?
No.
Why not?

1240
00:58:55,923 --> 00:58:57,446
I assumed someone
was doing that.

1241
00:58:57,621 --> 00:58:58,926
You assumed?

1242
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,928
Objection.
Badgering the witness.

1243
00:59:01,102 --> 00:59:03,062
Sustained.
Let me put it
another way, if I may.

1244
00:59:03,235 --> 00:59:05,300
Did the question of the
missing shirt ever come up?
No.

1245
00:59:05,324 --> 00:59:07,724
Why not?
I guess we were too busy
dealing with a dead body

1246
00:59:07,892 --> 00:59:09,807
to worry about a shirt.

1247
00:59:10,764 --> 00:59:11,764
Nothing further.

1248
00:59:33,744 --> 00:59:35,441
Animal Planet without sound.

1249
00:59:35,615 --> 00:59:37,574
It's his favorite channel.

1250
00:59:37,748 --> 00:59:38,923
This came from the lab.

1251
00:59:40,925 --> 00:59:44,145
I think I know what that is.

1252
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:45,320
What's it say?

1253
00:59:45,494 --> 00:59:47,627
Material is a silk Lycra mix.

1254
00:59:47,801 --> 00:59:50,587
Sample too badly burned
for further analysis.

1255
00:59:50,761 --> 00:59:52,921
So it's not cotton.
It's not Marty's shirt.
Correct.

1256
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,175
Which means
Becky didn't do it.

1257
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:55,200
Feel better?

1258
00:59:55,374 --> 00:59:59,508
Ah, I feel so much better.

1259
00:59:59,683 --> 01:00:00,683
How are you feeling?

1260
01:00:00,814 --> 01:00:01,293
Oh, I'm fine, thank you.

1261
01:00:01,467 --> 01:00:02,033
And you?

1262
01:00:02,207 --> 01:00:03,207
Good.

1263
01:00:04,992 --> 01:00:05,992
Detective Hanson.

1264
01:00:07,212 --> 01:00:09,693
When the crime scene was
dusted for fingerprints

1265
01:00:09,867 --> 01:00:12,565
where were the prints
of Mr. Devine found?

1266
01:00:12,739 --> 01:00:14,045
A partial
thumbprint was lifted

1267
01:00:14,219 --> 01:00:15,873
from the outside door knob.

1268
01:00:16,047 --> 01:00:18,136
And another was found on
the chair beside the desk.

1269
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:20,747
Were there any prints
on the murder weapon?

1270
01:00:20,921 --> 01:00:23,924
No, the surface appeared
to have been wiped clean.

1271
01:00:24,098 --> 01:00:26,144
Were prints belonging
to anyone else

1272
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:27,798
found in Mr. Caine's office?

1273
01:00:27,972 --> 01:00:29,887
Yes, forensics found
hundreds of prints.

1274
01:00:30,061 --> 01:00:32,716
All of which were matched
with employees, friends,

1275
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:35,806
or family of the victim.
It was a busy office.

1276
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:37,871
So you found hundreds of
prints all over the room

1277
01:00:37,895 --> 01:00:40,637
but only two belonging to Mr.
Devine?
Yes.

1278
01:00:40,811 --> 01:00:43,354
Find it strange that he would
have wiped his fingerprints off
the murder weapon,

1279
01:00:43,378 --> 01:00:45,206
but not the chair or the door?
Well perhaps

1280
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:47,141
the murder weapon was the only
thing he thought of.

1281
01:00:47,165 --> 01:00:48,664
Or perhaps he never
touched the murder weapon.

1282
01:00:48,688 --> 01:00:49,688
Objection.

1283
01:00:49,733 --> 01:00:50,734
Is there a question here?

1284
01:00:50,908 --> 01:00:51,735
Mr. McBride?

1285
01:00:51,909 --> 01:00:53,127
Withdrawn, Your Honor.

1286
01:00:55,042 --> 01:00:57,151
Detective Hanson,
were you in charge of this
case from the beginning?

1287
01:00:57,175 --> 01:00:58,916
No, I was assigned to the case

1288
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:01,614
about a week after the murder.
Uh huh.

1289
01:01:01,788 --> 01:01:03,572
And who was the lead detective

1290
01:01:03,747 --> 01:01:05,768
in the initial stages of
this case?
Detective Marsh.

1291
01:01:05,792 --> 01:01:07,402
Why was detective
Marsh removed?

1292
01:01:07,576 --> 01:01:09,622
He wasn't removed.
I was asked by the department

1293
01:01:09,796 --> 01:01:12,625
to head the investigation
because I have more experience

1294
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:14,627
in dealing with
high profile cases.

1295
01:01:14,801 --> 01:01:16,841
Is that the only reason
you were asked to step in?

1296
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:19,284
There were several other
factors involved in the
decision.

1297
01:01:20,807 --> 01:01:23,592
Primarily Marty
Caine's notoriety.

1298
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:25,856
Uh huh.

1299
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:28,312
Would you tell us specifically
what those other
considerations were?

1300
01:01:28,336 --> 01:01:31,731
Objection.
The witness is not qualified
to speak for her superior.

1301
01:01:31,905 --> 01:01:34,038
Your honor, as
Detective Hanson

1302
01:01:34,212 --> 01:01:35,909
was part of the
decision making process

1303
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:38,148
I would believe she is qualified
to answer the question.

1304
01:01:38,172 --> 01:01:40,132
Overruled, the witness
will answer the question.

1305
01:01:40,218 --> 01:01:42,699
I was concerned that
under the leadership

1306
01:01:42,873 --> 01:01:45,789
of Detective Marsh, the
investigation was not as
thorough

1307
01:01:45,963 --> 01:01:48,182
as it should have been.
And you,

1308
01:01:48,356 --> 01:01:50,141
expressed those
concerns to your superiors?

1309
01:01:50,315 --> 01:01:51,315
Yes I did.

1310
01:01:51,403 --> 01:01:52,230
Thank you.

1311
01:01:52,404 --> 01:01:53,753
No more questions.

1312
01:01:53,927 --> 01:01:54,928
Very well.

1313
01:01:55,102 --> 01:01:56,930
Well thank you Mr. McBride.

1314
01:01:57,104 --> 01:01:59,106
The witness may step down.

1315
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,674
We will now go to recess.

1316
01:02:01,848 --> 01:02:04,329
Court will reconvene
in one hour.

1317
01:02:14,905 --> 01:02:15,949
Hi.

1318
01:02:16,123 --> 01:02:17,690
I found this under the door.

1319
01:02:17,864 --> 01:02:19,692
I have the shirt
you're looking for.

1320
01:02:19,866 --> 01:02:22,062
It's yours for 20,000 tickets
to the Elysian park tomorrow,

1321
01:02:22,086 --> 01:02:24,915
and leave it in the trash can
located near the playground.

1322
01:02:31,138 --> 01:02:32,966
Okay, so where do
we find 20 grand?

1323
01:02:34,185 --> 01:02:36,076
You honestly want to
deal with a ransom demand?

1324
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:38,842
No, but someone
knows that that shirt

1325
01:02:39,016 --> 01:02:40,278
could clear our client.

1326
01:02:40,452 --> 01:02:41,975
I'd like to know
who that someone is.

1327
01:02:42,149 --> 01:02:43,736
So what, we're just
gonna make 20,000 dollars

1328
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,586
appear and walk into
Elysian Park tomorrow

1329
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,414
and put it in a trashcan?

1330
01:02:46,588 --> 01:02:48,329
Yes.
If you've got 20
grand lying around

1331
01:02:48,503 --> 01:02:49,940
I'll come back next week.

1332
01:02:50,114 --> 01:02:52,072
Were you leaving?
Yeah, my weeks up.

1333
01:02:52,246 --> 01:02:54,355
I'm booked at a nice clean
dentist office for a whole
month.

1334
01:02:54,379 --> 01:02:57,164
Oy!
I'm gonna miss you.
Me too.

1335
01:02:57,338 --> 01:02:59,018
It's been a pleasure
working with two men

1336
01:02:59,123 --> 01:03:00,254
who are trying to do good.

1337
01:03:00,428 --> 01:03:01,821
That's very sweet.

1338
01:03:01,995 --> 01:03:04,781
Got it.
I know where to get the money.

1339
01:03:24,235 --> 01:03:27,151
Tell me you did not
burn the funny money.

1340
01:03:34,027 --> 01:03:36,160
Ta dah!

1341
01:03:36,334 --> 01:03:38,075
I just keeping these
for souvenir really.

1342
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:40,009
I'm going to incinerate them.
Just like you told me.

1343
01:03:40,033 --> 01:03:41,315
You know what,
I'm glad you waited.

1344
01:03:41,339 --> 01:03:42,166
Yeah.

1345
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:43,645
20,000 bucks, huh?

1346
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,559
Uh huh.

1347
01:03:44,733 --> 01:03:46,126
What do I need?

1348
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:49,042
I'm thinking 10
percent on the dollar.

1349
01:03:49,216 --> 01:03:50,783
Are you?

1350
01:03:50,957 --> 01:03:52,587
That's funny 'cause you
know what I was thinking?

1351
01:03:52,611 --> 01:03:55,266
I was thinking about
the 5,000 dollars worth

1352
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,398
of legal services you got for...

1353
01:03:57,572 --> 01:03:58,356
500

1354
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:00,837
Oh, 500.

1355
01:04:01,011 --> 01:04:02,142
There's work involved.

1356
01:04:04,014 --> 01:04:06,886
Okay McBride, you're
a tough man, you know.

1357
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:10,020
You're a good man,
but you're very hard.

1358
01:04:10,194 --> 01:04:11,194
Thanks Mo.

1359
01:05:39,109 --> 01:05:40,109
Hey, hey!

1360
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:58,954
Get up.

1361
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:04,656
So you got the shirt?

1362
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:06,136
What shirt?

1363
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:08,312
The shirt that
you tried to ransom

1364
01:06:08,486 --> 01:06:10,357
for bag full of phony money.

1365
01:06:10,531 --> 01:06:12,727
Believe me, you don't want to
get involved in a murder case

1366
01:06:12,751 --> 01:06:15,145
over a bag full of play money.

1367
01:06:35,295 --> 01:06:37,297
Marty was very special.

1368
01:06:37,471 --> 01:06:39,038
The minute you
mentioned it in court

1369
01:06:39,212 --> 01:06:41,388
I knew this was the shirt
you were talking about.

1370
01:06:41,562 --> 01:06:43,042
How?

1371
01:06:43,216 --> 01:06:45,131
How did you know it
wasn't an old shirt?

1372
01:06:47,742 --> 01:06:49,179
The monogram, see.

1373
01:06:49,353 --> 01:06:50,658
MC.

1374
01:06:52,443 --> 01:06:53,443
Now look.

1375
01:06:56,142 --> 01:06:57,622
That was taken last year.

1376
01:06:57,796 --> 01:06:59,145
See the monogram?

1377
01:06:59,319 --> 01:07:01,452
MTC, for Theodore.

1378
01:07:01,626 --> 01:07:02,931
He dropped it last year.

1379
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:04,150
He changed the design.

1380
01:07:04,324 --> 01:07:05,324
It's sleeker.

1381
01:07:05,369 --> 01:07:06,674
Don't you think?

1382
01:07:06,848 --> 01:07:07,675
So this, it has
to be a new shirt.

1383
01:07:07,849 --> 01:07:10,243
Hum, very clever.

1384
01:07:10,417 --> 01:07:11,417
And where did you buy it?

1385
01:07:11,462 --> 01:07:12,854
On eBay.

1386
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,029
When Marty died

1387
01:07:15,074 --> 01:07:16,530
I tried to get ahold of
as much stuff as possible.

1388
01:07:16,554 --> 01:07:18,077
I mean they're
collector's items now.

1389
01:07:18,251 --> 01:07:19,078
It's really exciting.

1390
01:07:19,252 --> 01:07:20,427
Oh yes, I'm sure.

1391
01:07:20,601 --> 01:07:21,428
Who sold it to you?

1392
01:07:21,602 --> 01:07:22,951
I have no idea.

1393
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:24,277
What do you mean
you have no idea?

1394
01:07:24,301 --> 01:07:25,452
Just their subscriber name.

1395
01:07:25,476 --> 01:07:26,955
Well, how did you pay for it?

1396
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:29,132
Online, a PayPal account.

1397
01:07:29,306 --> 01:07:31,090
Okay, whose name was
on the PayPal account?

1398
01:07:31,264 --> 01:07:33,223
Same thing, subscriber.

1399
01:07:33,397 --> 01:07:35,529
All right. I'll tell you what
I'm gonna need,

1400
01:07:35,703 --> 01:07:37,444
as much information as I can.

1401
01:07:37,618 --> 01:07:39,272
No, no, no.
Email me as much

1402
01:07:39,446 --> 01:07:41,361
as you can give me about the,

1403
01:07:41,535 --> 01:07:44,016
person that you bought it from.
Their email account or anything

1404
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:46,105
because we've got to
find this person, okay?

1405
01:07:46,279 --> 01:07:50,283
That was Marty's personal
notepad

1406
01:07:50,457 --> 01:07:51,806
It was in mint condition.

1407
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:53,262
Can we get real
names from PayPal?

1408
01:07:53,286 --> 01:07:54,481
If i have the time officially,

1409
01:07:54,505 --> 01:07:55,941
or I could just get subpoenas.

1410
01:07:56,115 --> 01:07:57,527
Well, we don't have
the time for that.

1411
01:07:57,551 --> 01:07:59,379
Well then we'll
do it unofficially.

1412
01:07:59,553 --> 01:08:01,425
Oh, sorry.
Just a little.

1413
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:03,577
You get that off, right?
All right, you
look very nervous.

1414
01:08:03,601 --> 01:08:05,342
Give me this.
I need this for the trial.

1415
01:08:05,516 --> 01:08:07,953
I want this information
and I want it soon.

1416
01:08:08,127 --> 01:08:11,087
Thank you.

1417
01:08:14,307 --> 01:08:17,615
Okay, here's the list of
all the PayPal transactions
from March 8th,

1418
01:08:17,789 --> 01:08:20,357
including the subscriber
names and their details.

1419
01:08:20,531 --> 01:08:21,531
Must be thousands.

1420
01:08:21,662 --> 01:08:22,702
Maybe tens of thousands.

1421
01:08:22,837 --> 01:08:25,144
What's the subscriber name?

1422
01:08:38,679 --> 01:08:40,239
There it is.
Well, what do you know?

1423
01:08:40,377 --> 01:08:43,989
What, somebody you know?

1424
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:10,363
Becky's not here.

1425
01:09:10,537 --> 01:09:13,758
Well, it's not
Becky I came to see.

1426
01:09:16,543 --> 01:09:18,023
I didn't kill him.

1427
01:09:18,197 --> 01:09:19,479
But you were with
him the night he died?

1428
01:09:19,503 --> 01:09:20,721
Yeah.

1429
01:09:20,895 --> 01:09:22,723
You were having
a relationship?

1430
01:09:22,897 --> 01:09:24,377
Regular sweethearts.

1431
01:09:24,551 --> 01:09:25,551
That was us.

1432
01:09:25,596 --> 01:09:26,596
How'd you meet him?

1433
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:27,641
Becky introduced us.

1434
01:09:27,815 --> 01:09:30,035
I thought he was charming, rich.

1435
01:09:30,209 --> 01:09:31,689
And he knew people.

1436
01:09:31,863 --> 01:09:33,081
Knew people?

1437
01:09:33,256 --> 01:09:34,387
In the business.

1438
01:09:34,561 --> 01:09:35,388
Ah.

1439
01:09:35,562 --> 01:09:36,911
Do you think it's easy

1440
01:09:37,085 --> 01:09:38,522
going from one
audition to the next,

1441
01:09:38,696 --> 01:09:41,699
all the time seeing
others get the parts?

1442
01:09:41,873 --> 01:09:44,267
You want to know what it's
like when you wake up one day

1443
01:09:44,441 --> 01:09:47,095
and realize that waiting
for your life to begin

1444
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:48,532
is your life?

1445
01:09:49,924 --> 01:09:51,578
And then Marty came along,

1446
01:09:51,752 --> 01:09:53,363
and he seemed to like me.

1447
01:09:53,537 --> 01:09:54,537
Me.

1448
01:09:55,539 --> 01:09:57,758
And I thought what's the harm?

1449
01:09:57,932 --> 01:10:01,197
He could, you know.

1450
01:10:01,371 --> 01:10:02,371
I know.

1451
01:10:02,502 --> 01:10:04,243
It happens, Mr. McBride.

1452
01:10:04,417 --> 01:10:06,767
Not everyone gets to
the top on talent alone.

1453
01:10:06,941 --> 01:10:07,725
I understand.

1454
01:10:07,899 --> 01:10:08,899
Could you just,

1455
01:10:10,336 --> 01:10:12,295
just tell me about
the night Marty died.

1456
01:10:14,253 --> 01:10:15,472
He dumped me.

1457
01:10:15,646 --> 01:10:16,966
He said it wasn't
working anymore.

1458
01:10:17,909 --> 01:10:19,563
You just get to
decide that, do you?

1459
01:10:19,737 --> 01:10:21,260
Yes, Gina, I do.

1460
01:10:21,434 --> 01:10:22,434
When?
When what?

1461
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:23,480
When did you decide?

1462
01:10:23,654 --> 01:10:24,481
I'm guessing it wasn't tonight.

1463
01:10:24,655 --> 01:10:26,396
So, what was that?

1464
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:28,441
That was life.

1465
01:10:28,615 --> 01:10:30,661
Show biz.
What about the party.

1466
01:10:30,835 --> 01:10:33,664
Party?
Oh, you don't still think you're
going to the party, do you?

1467
01:10:33,838 --> 01:10:37,276
But you said...
Said, I say a lot
of things, Gina.

1468
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:38,732
You said there'd
be people there.

1469
01:10:38,756 --> 01:10:40,453
You'd introduce me.

1470
01:10:40,627 --> 01:10:42,499
Producers, agents.

1471
01:10:42,673 --> 01:10:44,327
And Victoria.

1472
01:10:45,371 --> 01:10:49,332
Do you really think I want you
and my wife in the same room?

1473
01:10:49,506 --> 01:10:50,506
No.

1474
01:10:54,554 --> 01:10:55,599
I just had to get out.

1475
01:10:55,773 --> 01:10:57,775
I didn't want him to see.

1476
01:10:57,949 --> 01:10:58,949
See what?

1477
01:11:03,041 --> 01:11:05,217
I thought about
crashing the party.

1478
01:11:05,391 --> 01:11:06,827
I figured I'd earned it,

1479
01:11:07,001 --> 01:11:10,309
but in the end I tidied
myself up and went home.

1480
01:11:10,483 --> 01:11:12,616
Must have been hard on you.

1481
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:14,357
Yes.

1482
01:11:14,531 --> 01:11:15,619
Felt used.

1483
01:11:15,793 --> 01:11:17,229
With losing your
temper at Marty,

1484
01:11:17,403 --> 01:11:18,728
that'd be completely
understandable.

1485
01:11:18,752 --> 01:11:19,752
Only I didn't.

1486
01:11:21,364 --> 01:11:22,190
I didn't kill him.

1487
01:11:22,365 --> 01:11:23,583
No?
No.

1488
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,671
Could you explain

1489
01:11:26,586 --> 01:11:27,586
what you were doing

1490
01:11:28,936 --> 01:11:29,936
with that?

1491
01:11:32,897 --> 01:11:35,813
So it's part of your job
to look after the guests?

1492
01:11:35,987 --> 01:11:37,075
That's right.

1493
01:11:37,249 --> 01:11:38,511
Calm nerves before the show,

1494
01:11:38,685 --> 01:11:40,513
smooth ruffled
feathers afterwards.

1495
01:11:40,687 --> 01:11:41,819
Pretty much, yeah.

1496
01:11:43,386 --> 01:11:44,746
In all the years
you worked there

1497
01:11:44,778 --> 01:11:46,780
you must've been
able to get a sense

1498
01:11:46,954 --> 01:11:49,348
about which guests may
potentially be volatile or
dangerous.

1499
01:11:49,522 --> 01:11:50,523
Objection, Your Honor.

1500
01:11:50,697 --> 01:11:52,482
The witness is not qualified

1501
01:11:52,656 --> 01:11:55,180
to give expert
psychiatric testimony.
Sustained.

1502
01:11:55,354 --> 01:11:56,679
Did you think Mr.
Devine was a threat?

1503
01:11:56,703 --> 01:11:57,878
None whatsoever.

1504
01:11:58,052 --> 01:11:59,706
He was kind of sweet.

1505
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:00,880
Thank you.

1506
01:12:02,709 --> 01:12:04,668
Have you lived in LA long?

1507
01:12:04,842 --> 01:12:05,538
Eight years.

1508
01:12:05,712 --> 01:12:06,712
Live alone?

1509
01:12:06,844 --> 01:12:07,844
Um no.

1510
01:12:07,975 --> 01:12:09,020
I share with someone else.

1511
01:12:10,021 --> 01:12:11,414
Gina Carson, right?

1512
01:12:11,588 --> 01:12:12,589
That's right.

1513
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:15,156
Get along okay?

1514
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,332
Relevance, Your Honor?

1515
01:12:16,506 --> 01:12:17,898
Your honor, a little latitude.

1516
01:12:18,072 --> 01:12:19,592
I promise everything
will become clear.

1517
01:12:19,726 --> 01:12:21,598
I hope we all fervently
share, Mr. McBride.

1518
01:12:21,772 --> 01:12:23,730
Please proceed.
How would you characterize

1519
01:12:23,904 --> 01:12:25,471
your relationship
with Miss Carson?

1520
01:12:25,645 --> 01:12:28,213
It's okay.
We share.

1521
01:12:28,387 --> 01:12:30,389
It's, it's not like we're
best friends or anything.

1522
01:12:30,563 --> 01:12:31,651
Arguments?

1523
01:12:31,825 --> 01:12:32,825
Some.

1524
01:12:33,697 --> 01:12:35,002
Like what?

1525
01:12:35,176 --> 01:12:36,874
The usual, what's
mine is mine.

1526
01:12:37,048 --> 01:12:39,790
I prefer it when
people respect that.

1527
01:12:40,791 --> 01:12:43,533
So you'd get
annoyed, say, if she,

1528
01:12:43,707 --> 01:12:45,347
I don't know borrowed
some of your clothes

1529
01:12:45,491 --> 01:12:46,623
without asking first?

1530
01:12:46,797 --> 01:12:48,364
Of course.
Right.

1531
01:12:48,538 --> 01:12:50,191
Now, as I'm sure you're aware

1532
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,716
there was something missing
from the murder scene.

1533
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:53,934
Marty's shirt, yes.

1534
01:12:54,979 --> 01:12:56,850
And it's possible
whoever took Marty's shirt

1535
01:12:57,024 --> 01:12:58,591
was also his murderer.

1536
01:12:58,765 --> 01:13:00,985
Objection.
This theory again.

1537
01:13:01,159 --> 01:13:03,596
Perhaps counsel would prefer
to stick the known facts.

1538
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:04,890
Be a pleasure, Your Honor.

1539
01:13:04,945 --> 01:13:06,512
Fact, the shirt was missing.

1540
01:13:06,686 --> 01:13:08,534
Fact, it was ever found
anywhere near Mr. Devine.

1541
01:13:08,558 --> 01:13:09,558
Overruled.

1542
01:13:09,602 --> 01:13:10,602
So Becky,

1543
01:13:11,691 --> 01:13:15,303
it's possible that
if we find the person

1544
01:13:15,478 --> 01:13:17,915
who took Marty Caine's shirt,

1545
01:13:18,089 --> 01:13:20,613
we might also find his killer.

1546
01:13:20,787 --> 01:13:21,484
You agree?

1547
01:13:21,658 --> 01:13:22,658
I guess so.

1548
01:13:22,702 --> 01:13:23,702
Thank you, Becky.

1549
01:13:23,790 --> 01:13:24,878
You've been very helpful.

1550
01:13:28,099 --> 01:13:30,797
Miss Carson, how long have you
had Miss Tranta been friends

1551
01:13:30,971 --> 01:13:31,755
and roommates?

1552
01:13:31,929 --> 01:13:32,756
Couple of years.

1553
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:34,540
Friendship close?

1554
01:13:34,714 --> 01:13:35,714
It's okay.

1555
01:13:36,716 --> 01:13:37,716
I understand

1556
01:13:38,501 --> 01:13:40,633
that you're an actress.

1557
01:13:40,807 --> 01:13:43,506
Aspiring is more like it.

1558
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,280
Tough business to
break into, isn't it?

1559
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:46,639
Tell me about it.

1560
01:13:46,813 --> 01:13:47,640
Any luck?
A little.

1561
01:13:47,814 --> 01:13:49,642
Just one big break away.

1562
01:13:49,816 --> 01:13:51,296
Ah good.

1563
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:53,646
But in the meantime it certainly
helps to have

1564
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:54,821
Becky share the rent.

1565
01:13:54,995 --> 01:13:56,257
Definitely.

1566
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:57,712
Do you two share
anything else?

1567
01:13:57,824 --> 01:14:00,479
Clothes, for instance?

1568
01:14:00,653 --> 01:14:02,394
I couldn't help noticing that

1569
01:14:02,568 --> 01:14:04,008
you're both just
about the same size.

1570
01:14:04,178 --> 01:14:05,721
Sometimes Becky lets
me borrow something

1571
01:14:05,745 --> 01:14:07,878
when I have an
important audition.

1572
01:14:10,707 --> 01:14:12,752
Have you had an
important audition lately?
Yes.

1573
01:14:12,926 --> 01:14:14,806
And did Becky let you
borrow something for it?

1574
01:14:14,972 --> 01:14:15,973
Not exactly.

1575
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:19,150
Becky.

1576
01:14:19,324 --> 01:14:21,413
Occasionally I borrow
clothes from Becky,

1577
01:14:21,587 --> 01:14:23,023
but I couldn't find her.

1578
01:14:23,197 --> 01:14:24,460
So you went to her closet

1579
01:14:24,634 --> 01:14:25,741
to try to find
something to wear?

1580
01:14:25,765 --> 01:14:26,765
Yes.

1581
01:14:28,289 --> 01:14:30,703
That's when you noticed
that she had a shirt that
belonged to Marty Caine.

1582
01:14:30,727 --> 01:14:33,686
So you replaced it
with another shirt

1583
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:35,296
from her closet,

1584
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,124
and took the Marty
Caine shirt with you.

1585
01:14:42,216 --> 01:14:44,915
It wasn't the first thing
of Marty's that you took,

1586
01:14:45,089 --> 01:14:47,091
was it?
No.

1587
01:14:47,265 --> 01:14:49,659
So you grabbed the
monogram shirt out of the bag

1588
01:14:49,833 --> 01:14:51,593
and then put something
of Becky's you'd found

1589
01:14:51,704 --> 01:14:53,532
in her closet in, correct?

1590
01:14:53,706 --> 01:14:54,751
Objection, Your Honor.

1591
01:14:54,925 --> 01:14:56,666
We're here to try a murder,

1592
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,929
not a clothes barring
disagreement between roommates.

1593
01:14:59,103 --> 01:15:01,037
Your honor I promise you
this line of questioning

1594
01:15:01,061 --> 01:15:02,541
will go directly to cause.

1595
01:15:02,715 --> 01:15:03,977
It better, Mr. McBride.

1596
01:15:04,151 --> 01:15:05,151
Overruled.

1597
01:15:06,153 --> 01:15:07,894
You're not in
any trouble here.

1598
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,680
But you did have a nice
little business on the side,
didn't you?

1599
01:15:11,724 --> 01:15:13,726
Taking Marty's things
and selling them

1600
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:15,380
to collectors, didn't you?

1601
01:15:15,554 --> 01:15:17,687
It was just extra stuff.
I understand.

1602
01:15:17,861 --> 01:15:19,950
So you took the shirt and
sold it on eBay, correct?

1603
01:15:20,124 --> 01:15:21,821
Yes.

1604
01:15:21,995 --> 01:15:25,477
Matter of fact, we
found the person who

1605
01:15:25,651 --> 01:15:27,523
bought it from you.
He's in court today.

1606
01:15:27,697 --> 01:15:29,133
Ned, would you stand up please?

1607
01:15:31,004 --> 01:15:33,964
Thank you.

1608
01:15:36,314 --> 01:15:38,664
Your Honor, I have no more
questions of this witness

1609
01:15:38,838 --> 01:15:39,839
Mr. Kendall?

1610
01:15:40,013 --> 01:15:41,093
No questions, Your Honor.

1611
01:15:41,188 --> 01:15:42,320
The witness may step down.

1612
01:15:44,235 --> 01:15:46,106
This time the defense recalls

1613
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,152
Rebecca Tranter to the stand.

1614
01:15:48,326 --> 01:15:52,330
The bailiff will recall
Becky Tranter to the stand.

1615
01:15:56,639 --> 01:15:58,466
Well, I guess we know

1616
01:15:58,641 --> 01:16:00,512
what happened to
Marty's missing shirt.

1617
01:16:00,686 --> 01:16:02,645
It was in a paper bag
in your closet at home.

1618
01:16:02,819 --> 01:16:03,819
Gina's lying.

1619
01:16:03,863 --> 01:16:04,908
Why would she do that?

1620
01:16:05,082 --> 01:16:06,282
Maybe because she killed him

1621
01:16:06,344 --> 01:16:07,737
and she's trying
to pin it on me.

1622
01:16:07,911 --> 01:16:10,261
Oh, but she didn't, did she?

1623
01:16:12,698 --> 01:16:14,700
You took the shirt
from Marty's office

1624
01:16:14,874 --> 01:16:18,704
and wore it because his blood
was all over your blouse.

1625
01:16:18,878 --> 01:16:19,879
No.

1626
01:16:20,053 --> 01:16:21,620
You wore it home, didn't you?

1627
01:16:21,794 --> 01:16:23,404
No.
Couldn't dispose
of it on the way,

1628
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,165
so you took it home so you
could destroy it later.

1629
01:16:25,189 --> 01:16:26,189
No.

1630
01:16:26,277 --> 01:16:26,799
That never happened?

1631
01:16:26,973 --> 01:16:27,974
No!

1632
01:16:28,148 --> 01:16:28,801
You never wore this shirt?

1633
01:16:28,975 --> 01:16:29,975
Of course not.

1634
01:16:31,195 --> 01:16:32,912
I noticed that you
scratch your arm a bit.

1635
01:16:32,936 --> 01:16:35,547
Do you have a skin condition?
Yes.

1636
01:16:35,721 --> 01:16:38,681
Would you roll up
your sleeve, please?

1637
01:16:39,159 --> 01:16:42,119
Please.

1638
01:16:50,127 --> 01:16:51,127
Okay?

1639
01:16:51,998 --> 01:16:53,086
Atopic dermatitis.

1640
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:55,436
Sort of like eczema, right?

1641
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:56,611
Yes.

1642
01:16:58,875 --> 01:17:00,659
I have a lab
report here of tests

1643
01:17:00,833 --> 01:17:02,574
that were run on the shirt.

1644
01:17:02,748 --> 01:17:07,448
On the left sleeve were
found traces of Chlorocrasol,

1645
01:17:07,753 --> 01:17:11,670
emulsifying wax, purified
water, hydrocortisone.

1646
01:17:12,366 --> 01:17:13,890
So?
Ingredients

1647
01:17:14,064 --> 01:17:16,936
in an emollient
used for dermatitis,

1648
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:18,242
skin cream.

1649
01:17:18,416 --> 01:17:19,656
This is some sort of mistake.

1650
01:17:19,809 --> 01:17:21,637
No, no mistake.

1651
01:17:21,811 --> 01:17:23,073
This is a shirt that says

1652
01:17:25,249 --> 01:17:26,249
you're the killer.

1653
01:17:27,033 --> 01:17:31,647
That you hit Marty Caine.

1654
01:17:32,735 --> 01:17:33,736
No it isn't.

1655
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:35,563
You know that, do you?

1656
01:17:35,738 --> 01:17:36,738
Yes.

1657
01:17:36,782 --> 01:17:37,304
You know that for sure?

1658
01:17:37,478 --> 01:17:38,610
Yes.

1659
01:17:38,784 --> 01:17:40,064
No matter what
the experts say,

1660
01:17:40,090 --> 01:17:41,130
no matter what they found,

1661
01:17:41,221 --> 01:17:42,570
you know they're wrong

1662
01:17:42,745 --> 01:17:44,616
because this isn't the shirt.

1663
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:45,617
Yes.

1664
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:47,227
Because you burned it?

1665
01:17:47,401 --> 01:17:49,012
I don't know what you mean.

1666
01:17:49,186 --> 01:17:50,404
Yes you do.

1667
01:17:51,841 --> 01:17:53,281
The only thing is
you didn't burn it.

1668
01:17:53,451 --> 01:17:55,235
You just thought you did.

1669
01:17:55,409 --> 01:17:56,409
You never checked

1670
01:17:57,716 --> 01:18:00,240
to make sure it was
Marty's shirt in the bag.

1671
01:18:00,414 --> 01:18:01,414
Why would you?

1672
01:18:02,329 --> 01:18:04,680
Gina certainly wasn't
going to say anything.

1673
01:18:04,854 --> 01:18:07,813
She shouldn't have been in
your room to begin with.

1674
01:18:07,987 --> 01:18:08,988
Boy all this time,

1675
01:18:10,163 --> 01:18:12,383
thinking you got away
with it and you know what?

1676
01:18:15,038 --> 01:18:16,300
You nearly did.

1677
01:18:16,474 --> 01:18:18,084
He should've
been more careful.

1678
01:18:19,259 --> 01:18:21,000
He should've watched
what he said.

1679
01:18:23,742 --> 01:18:25,962
He knew my father
in the old days

1680
01:18:26,136 --> 01:18:27,877
before Marty was famous.

1681
01:18:28,965 --> 01:18:30,314
We talked about that, too.

1682
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,189
Becky, that photo,

1683
01:18:37,277 --> 01:18:39,105
that photo is from
our first show.

1684
01:18:39,279 --> 01:18:42,152
My girlfriend is
hairier than I am.

1685
01:18:43,109 --> 01:18:44,109
We've grown.

1686
01:18:45,982 --> 01:18:48,288
Now, here you
are 10 years later.

1687
01:18:48,462 --> 01:18:49,594
Who would have thought?

1688
01:18:49,768 --> 01:18:50,768
Not me.

1689
01:18:52,336 --> 01:18:53,336
Dad either.

1690
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:56,208
He should be here.

1691
01:18:57,341 --> 01:19:00,170
He'd be in his office
blasting some opera.

1692
01:19:00,344 --> 01:19:02,781
Madame Butterfly, or singing
at the top of his voice

1693
01:19:02,955 --> 01:19:04,087
The Marriage of Figaro.

1694
01:19:04,957 --> 01:19:07,177
Becky, those were his favorites.

1695
01:19:07,351 --> 01:19:09,875
And Orpheus And Eurydice.

1696
01:19:10,049 --> 01:19:12,617
Playing that morning.

1697
01:19:12,791 --> 01:19:15,185
Wait, you were there?

1698
01:19:20,277 --> 01:19:21,321
He called me,

1699
01:19:21,495 --> 01:19:22,845
begged me to come over, talk.

1700
01:19:23,019 --> 01:19:24,324
I did.

1701
01:19:24,498 --> 01:19:26,109
Your father, all he wanted
from me

1702
01:19:26,283 --> 01:19:27,763
was to let him produce the
new show.

1703
01:19:27,937 --> 01:19:29,590
That's all.

1704
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:30,765
Well, what did you say?

1705
01:19:30,853 --> 01:19:32,115
I told him the truth.

1706
01:19:32,289 --> 01:19:34,117
That I had carried
him on my back

1707
01:19:34,291 --> 01:19:35,727
all those years in Detroit,

1708
01:19:35,901 --> 01:19:37,511
and I wasn't going
to do it anymore.

1709
01:19:37,685 --> 01:19:39,949
He had no one else to
blame for this but himself.

1710
01:19:40,123 --> 01:19:42,144
And if it hadn't been for
me, he would have ended up

1711
01:19:42,168 --> 01:19:44,214
like he did years
earlier, maybe worse.

1712
01:19:44,388 --> 01:19:46,042
A drunk, a bum,

1713
01:19:47,347 --> 01:19:48,347
a looser.

1714
01:19:48,435 --> 01:19:49,435
That's what I told him.

1715
01:19:59,838 --> 01:20:02,058
Marty was the reason
dad killed himself.

1716
01:20:04,843 --> 01:20:05,888
He broke his heart.

1717
01:20:18,378 --> 01:20:19,858
And the shirt?

1718
01:20:20,032 --> 01:20:22,426
So long as I had
my jacket buttoned up

1719
01:20:24,036 --> 01:20:25,429
no one could see the monogram.

1720
01:20:27,257 --> 01:20:28,301
I went to the party.

1721
01:20:30,521 --> 01:20:31,521
Afterward I,

1722
01:20:33,089 --> 01:20:34,090
I took a detour,

1723
01:20:35,613 --> 01:20:36,832
got rid of my shirt,

1724
01:20:38,442 --> 01:20:40,313
and went home to burn Marty's.

1725
01:20:40,487 --> 01:20:42,750
I see now in taking me in,

1726
01:20:42,925 --> 01:20:43,925
giving me a job,

1727
01:20:44,013 --> 01:20:45,666
making sure I was okay.

1728
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:46,885
I thought he cared.

1729
01:20:48,365 --> 01:20:50,106
He should have kept
his mouth shut.

1730
01:20:52,064 --> 01:20:54,153
No more questions.

1731
01:20:58,984 --> 01:21:00,943
Get ready for it.

1732
01:21:01,117 --> 01:21:03,077
So what does it feel
like to be a free man, Joe?

1733
01:21:03,162 --> 01:21:04,816
Feels good, feels very good.

1734
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:07,123
Tracy, tell us how you
feel now the trial's over

1735
01:21:07,297 --> 01:21:08,864
and Joe's free.

1736
01:21:09,038 --> 01:21:10,838
Well, of course it's
been a terrible strain,

1737
01:21:10,996 --> 01:21:12,868
but we're just happy that...

1738
01:21:13,042 --> 01:21:14,434
Excuse me!
Becky!

1739
01:21:14,608 --> 01:21:16,219
Becky, do you have
any words for us?

1740
01:21:16,393 --> 01:21:18,786
Anything, anything
about the trial?

1741
01:21:18,961 --> 01:21:19,961
Phil.

1742
01:21:21,093 --> 01:21:23,226
Mr. McBride, thank you so much.

1743
01:21:24,575 --> 01:21:25,576
Thank you.

1744
01:21:27,099 --> 01:21:28,099
Thank you both.

1745
01:21:34,498 --> 01:21:35,978
I mean, we can get them back.

1746
01:21:36,152 --> 01:21:37,805
You know, I have a
story to sell now

1747
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:39,914
so we can get like interviews
and stuff and you'll be...

1748
01:21:39,938 --> 01:21:42,245
No, it's not like that, Joe.

1749
01:21:42,419 --> 01:21:43,570
If people want to hear me sing,

1750
01:21:43,594 --> 01:21:45,161
it's because I have talent.

1751
01:21:45,335 --> 01:21:48,033
Not because I'm some
celebrity of the week.

1752
01:21:48,207 --> 01:21:49,207
Let's go home.

1753
01:21:53,604 --> 01:21:55,127
It's crazy to think that Becky

1754
01:21:55,301 --> 01:21:57,956
would have let Joe go
to jail for her crime.

1755
01:21:59,392 --> 01:22:00,437
Hey, we did good today.

1756
01:22:01,612 --> 01:22:02,961
Yes we did.

1757
01:22:03,135 --> 01:22:04,295
Innocent man gets to go home.

1758
01:22:04,397 --> 01:22:05,529
Yeah.

1759
01:22:05,703 --> 01:22:07,313
Hi.
Hey.

1760
01:22:07,487 --> 01:22:09,054
Good job guys.
Thanks.

1761
01:22:09,228 --> 01:22:10,664
You're going to
run point on Becky?

1762
01:22:10,838 --> 01:22:14,146
Yes, thanks to you the
case is cut and dried.

1763
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:15,843
One thing though,

1764
01:22:16,018 --> 01:22:17,410
all you had is Gina's word

1765
01:22:17,584 --> 01:22:19,412
that she found the
shirt in Becky's closet.

1766
01:22:21,066 --> 01:22:23,329
How did you know that
Becky was Marty's killer?

1767
01:22:23,503 --> 01:22:26,985
She was the only
one who cried for him.

1768
01:22:27,638 --> 01:22:29,118
