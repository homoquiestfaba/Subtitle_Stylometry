2
00:00:47,492  -->  00:00:49,786
That was a time of uncertainty.

3
00:00:53,537  -->  00:00:57,124
That was a time before chaos
in an already chaotic world.

4
00:01:06,135  -->  00:01:08,429
That was the time to escape.

5
00:01:09,764  -->  00:01:11,099
Anyway...

6
00:01:11,349  -->  00:01:12,650
I just want out.

7
00:01:19,983  -->  00:01:21,609
Have some of these!

8
00:01:42,048  -->  00:01:46,843
Hey! Get out of the way!

9
00:01:58,023  -->  00:02:01,235
That was a time of yet another drought.

10
00:02:18,082  -->  00:02:20,168
That was also a time for wishing.

11
00:03:22,522  -->  00:03:23,982
Hey! My!

12
00:03:25,358  -->  00:03:27,986
I have dreamt of living by the sea.

13
00:03:33,199  -->  00:03:35,408
That was my simple wish.

14
00:03:55,630  -->  00:03:58,008
Sheesh, she was moaning wildly!

15
00:03:58,390  -->  00:04:01,995
And in the middle of the day!
Americans really are something else.

16
00:04:02,020  -->  00:04:03,062
They don’t care.

17
00:04:03,121  -->  00:04:04,080
She was faking it, I’m sure.

18
00:04:04,105  -->  00:04:06,322
It's so easy to fool guys
when it comes to sex.

19
00:04:06,347  -->  00:04:08,835
- We'll be having changes in our procedures.
- Is that what you do?

20
00:04:08,860  -->  00:04:10,236
The hotel is getting
deep-cleaning disinfection materials.

21
00:04:10,261  -->  00:04:12,472
The hotel is getting
deep-cleaning disinfection materials.

22
00:04:12,572  -->  00:04:14,924
…and we will all be trained
on how to use them.

23
00:04:14,949  -->  00:04:17,452
The world has more important problems
than your tittle-tattle.

24
00:04:17,477  -->  00:04:18,937
Why are you late?

25
00:04:19,996  -->  00:04:21,956
- Sorry, sir.
- You drive me nuts.

26
00:04:22,540  -->  00:04:24,000
You heard it on the news,

27
00:04:24,100  -->  00:04:25,476
there's already local
transmission of Covid.

28
00:04:25,501  -->  00:04:26,429
- He came from abroad,
- I'm not surprised.

29
00:04:26,454  -->  00:04:27,920
- but he still got infected.
- The infection is spreading everywhere,

30
00:04:27,945  -->  00:04:29,213
Imagine how many people
he got into contact with

31
00:04:29,238  -->  00:04:31,603
- even before they found out he's positive?
- even in rich countries.

32
00:04:31,674  -->  00:04:33,676
- I bet he's infected a lot of people.
- What more here where it's crowded?

33
00:04:33,943  -->  00:04:34,902
It probably won't be that bad

34
00:04:34,927  -->  00:04:36,512
since we're broken up
across different islands.

35
00:04:36,537  -->  00:04:39,165
Manila's going to take
the brunt of it.

36
00:04:39,265  -->  00:04:40,533
The virus won't reach here.

37
00:04:40,558  -->  00:04:44,087
There's even talk of Martial Law
in our Facebook group.

38
00:04:44,145  -->  00:04:47,040
I think it's better than have the virus
take us down one by one.

39
00:04:47,065  -->  00:04:48,107
Probably not.

40
00:04:48,245  -->  00:04:49,287
It's not Martial law.

41
00:04:49,312  -->  00:04:50,583
That's not the same as a lockdown.

42
00:04:50,651  -->  00:04:55,256
Well, the President did say
we're going to be fine.

43
00:04:55,281  -->  00:04:58,993
"Nothing to be scared
of this corona virus thing."

44
00:04:59,145  -->  00:05:00,094
That's what he said-

45
00:05:00,119  -->  00:05:01,904
- in the news.
- Mylene, Ditas-

46
00:05:01,929  -->  00:05:02,638
do you have something to share?

47
00:05:02,663  -->  00:05:04,103
Ditas has something to share.

48
00:05:04,563  -->  00:05:06,190
Maybe you'd like to get to work?

49
00:05:11,772  -->  00:05:13,733
Hey, Toni, maybe
you could get me an advance.

50
00:05:13,758  -->  00:05:16,961
You just had an advance, My.
It's called pool saving for a reason.

51
00:05:16,986  -->  00:05:18,859
Everyone waits for their turn to collect.

52
00:05:18,884  -->  00:05:19,987
You know that!

53
00:05:27,563  -->  00:05:30,900
Good evening, sir. Welcome to Playa.
How may I help you?

54
00:05:31,584  -->  00:05:32,835
One room. Two nights.

55
00:05:32,860  -->  00:05:34,939
Do you have any reservations, sir?

56
00:05:35,228  -->  00:05:37,282
None? Okay, I'll check it for you, sir.

57
00:05:39,217  -->  00:05:40,468
It's such a small amount, sheesh.

58
00:05:40,493  -->  00:05:41,937
Two thousand pesos is not small.

59
00:05:41,962  -->  00:05:43,436
I'm just the treasurer, Mylene.

60
00:05:43,461  -->  00:05:46,776
- It's not my money to give!
- Fine, fine. You're so fussy.

61
00:05:47,539  -->  00:05:48,747
Like it's a big deal!

62
00:05:48,772  -->  00:05:51,235
Would you like a room
near the beach?

63
00:05:52,158  -->  00:05:55,329
Okay, I can give you Casa Agua.

64
00:06:10,168  -->  00:06:11,628
Here's your card, sir.

65
00:06:11,653  -->  00:06:15,041
Go straight then turn right.

66
00:06:19,344  -->  00:06:21,384
Would you like me to accompany you, sir?

67
00:06:25,628  -->  00:06:28,965
That was a time of unexpected encounters

68
00:06:29,643  -->  00:06:32,813
or chances where hope could spring.

69
00:06:43,827  -->  00:06:46,830
YOU AND ME AND THE END

70
00:07:34,085  -->  00:07:35,003
Hello?

71
00:07:37,338  -->  00:07:39,424
Hello, Abby, please…

72
00:07:42,169  -->  00:07:44,254
It's Niko's birthday today, right?

73
00:07:45,636  -->  00:07:47,304
Can I talk to him?

74
00:07:52,187  -->  00:07:54,063
I just want to greet him.

75
00:07:55,481  -->  00:07:57,817
Can I just-

76
00:07:59,152  -->  00:08:00,987
Will you let me greet him at least?

77
00:08:05,158  -->  00:08:07,035
Damn it, Abby!

78
00:08:07,830  -->  00:08:09,164
He's my son, too!

79
00:08:09,287  -->  00:08:12,415
We're fine without you!
Don’t bother thinking about us, Martin.

80
00:08:13,124  -->  00:08:15,919
I hope this is the last time
we ever speak to each other.

81
00:08:16,169  -->  00:08:18,880
Forget about us. Bye!

82
00:08:29,515  -->  00:08:32,018
Shit! Shit!

83
00:12:07,358  -->  00:12:08,109
I won't do it.

84
00:12:10,611  -->  00:12:11,404
I won't do it.

85
00:12:11,946  -->  00:12:14,532
We're good, I won't call.
I just thought you were dead.

86
00:12:17,034  -->  00:12:18,119
We're good.

87
00:12:37,523  -->  00:12:39,859
Go on, miss. Get on
with your business.

88
00:12:42,310  -->  00:12:44,061
It's okay. I can come back
when you're gone.

89
00:12:44,187  -->  00:12:45,188
No, do it now.

90
00:12:58,868  -->  00:13:00,495
Why, are you afraid of me?

91
00:13:03,498  -->  00:13:05,124
Do I look like a psycho?

92
00:13:18,262  -->  00:13:19,555
You look lonely.

93
00:13:20,806  -->  00:13:23,809
But if you're going to kill yourself,
can you not do it on my shift?

94
00:13:24,393  -->  00:13:26,437
Blood is messy.
You'll give me a hard time.

95
00:13:30,487  -->  00:13:32,906
This is a no smoking hotel.

96
00:13:46,582  -->  00:13:48,501
That day...

97
00:13:48,526  -->  00:13:51,362
I thought of living a better life

98
00:13:52,380  -->  00:13:54,090
just to get to know her.

99
00:14:00,235  -->  00:14:02,515
- So many guests are checking out.
- That day...

100
00:14:02,890  -->  00:14:06,016
I didn’t understand the tension
that I was feeling.

101
00:14:06,602  -->  00:14:07,728
Either way...

102
00:14:07,783  -->  00:14:08,743
It’s not fear.

103
00:14:09,939  -->  00:14:11,315
More of concern

104
00:14:11,506  -->  00:14:12,466
for him.

105
00:14:13,317  -->  00:14:15,069
It's insane!

106
00:14:15,278  -->  00:14:18,155
Everyone's losing
their heads over Covid.

107
00:14:19,699  -->  00:14:22,757
I have a relative,
an OFW in Lombardy-

108
00:14:23,222  -->  00:14:24,432
Do you know where that is?

109
00:14:24,787  -->  00:14:26,289
That's in Italy.

110
00:14:26,664  -->  00:14:29,667
She's worried because
she doesn't have enough saved up.

111
00:14:30,229  -->  00:14:33,358
She won't last very long
without a job.

112
00:14:33,963  -->  00:14:35,464
Not unlike many of us here.

113
00:14:36,007  -->  00:14:39,368
So I suggest you don't slip up.

114
00:14:39,719  -->  00:14:42,212
If the management starts
asking questions, well…

115
00:14:49,345  -->  00:14:50,561
Hello, sir.

116
00:14:50,586  -->  00:14:54,841
Here's the soap, shampoo, toothbrush,
and toothpaste that you requested!

117
00:14:54,866  -->  00:14:55,908
Why did you bring these?

118
00:14:56,210  -->  00:14:56,711
Sir?

119
00:14:56,876  -->  00:14:59,128
The lady who did the cleaning earlier,
she's the one who forgot to replace those.

120
00:14:59,504  -->  00:15:01,590
I told the reception I want her
to bring those over.

121
00:15:02,325  -->  00:15:06,555
Ah, sorry, sir. We have
a shifting schedule per area.

122
00:15:06,996  -->  00:15:08,399
But here's what you needed.

123
00:15:10,221  -->  00:15:12,306
Is there anything else
I can help you with, sir?

124
00:15:13,294  -->  00:15:14,086
Nothing.

125
00:15:16,922  -->  00:15:18,507
- Ah, miss.
- Sir.

126
00:15:19,608  -->  00:15:22,445
If I call for room service,

127
00:15:22,470  -->  00:15:25,032
can I request that she be the one
to bring the order?

128
00:15:26,180  -->  00:15:29,944
Ah, that's the Food
and Beverage department, sir.

129
00:15:29,969  -->  00:15:32,805
We're assigned to different
departments here, so--

130
00:15:32,830  -->  00:15:34,832
Wow, like it's a big hotel.

131
00:15:36,892  -->  00:15:39,353
Do you remember the name of
the housekeeper, sir?

132
00:15:39,378  -->  00:15:42,006
I can relay a message
when she gets off work.

133
00:15:42,134  -->  00:15:44,062
Or did she cause you any trouble?

134
00:15:44,087  -->  00:15:45,325
You can make a complaint--

135
00:15:45,350  -->  00:15:46,995
Mylene. That's the name
on her nameplate.

136
00:15:47,511  -->  00:15:49,697
Oh, it's My!

137
00:15:49,722  -->  00:15:51,140
Okay, sir, I know her.

138
00:15:51,165  -->  00:15:52,667
Can you tell her that

139
00:15:53,751  -->  00:15:54,919
I want to see her?

140
00:15:55,830  -->  00:15:56,873
In your room, sir?

141
00:16:00,132  -->  00:16:01,175
Oh no,

142
00:16:01,245  -->  00:16:04,140
it's starting to sound like
you're up to no good.

143
00:16:04,165  -->  00:16:05,633
Maybe I should report you instead.

144
00:16:09,998  -->  00:16:10,916
Well, then.

145
00:16:11,394  -->  00:16:13,104
I'll let her know, sir.

146
00:16:17,681  -->  00:16:19,165
Asshole.

147
00:16:21,112  -->  00:16:25,157
I don't get why he's so
determined to see you.

148
00:16:25,825  -->  00:16:28,202
I even told him to just
complain you to the manager

149
00:16:28,536  -->  00:16:29,954
but he didn't want to.

150
00:16:31,622  -->  00:16:33,040
What did you do?

151
00:16:36,655  -->  00:16:39,033
Want to report him?

152
00:16:39,536  -->  00:16:40,579
That's harassment.

153
00:16:40,715  -->  00:16:41,424
Ah, no need.

154
00:16:43,442  -->  00:16:44,193
You sure?

155
00:16:44,218  -->  00:16:46,126
I'll just drop by,
see what he wants later.

156
00:16:46,529  -->  00:16:47,613
- Want me to back you up?
- No.

157
00:16:47,638  -->  00:16:48,305
- He looks like a thug.
- It's fine.

158
00:16:48,330  -->  00:16:49,821
It's okay, Ditas.
I can do it.

159
00:16:49,846  -->  00:16:51,056
- You're sure?
- Mm-hm.

160
00:16:52,059  -->  00:16:53,644
I did some boxing you know.

161
00:16:54,103  -->  00:16:54,977
I'll do it.

162
00:17:14,498  -->  00:17:15,477
Hello?

163
00:17:15,734  -->  00:17:18,903
Hello, sir. You need some assistance?

164
00:17:23,466  -->  00:17:25,134
I knocked on his door.

165
00:17:26,635  -->  00:17:29,805
And there... At that moment,

166
00:17:29,830  -->  00:17:31,749
The end has begun.

167
00:17:37,730  -->  00:17:38,481
Thanks for coming.

168
00:17:39,398  -->  00:17:40,316
Come in.

169
00:17:42,985  -->  00:17:44,028
No, thank you.

170
00:17:45,404  -->  00:17:49,577
I just dropped by to say sorry
for whatever wrong I did

171
00:17:49,602  -->  00:17:51,102
as an employee.

172
00:17:54,038  -->  00:17:57,291
You told me not to kill myself, right?
See, I didn't do it.

173
00:17:59,376  -->  00:18:01,045
But could you come inside for a bit?

174
00:18:02,505  -->  00:18:03,839
Are you blackmailing me?

175
00:18:08,135  -->  00:18:09,595
It's just that I don't have anyone
to have dinner with.

176
00:18:11,055  -->  00:18:12,281
And you were right,

177
00:18:12,306  -->  00:18:14,450
I am lonely.
You're lonely, too, aren't you?

178
00:18:14,475  -->  00:18:17,228
I'm not some god who'll come
and save you, got that?

179
00:18:17,957  -->  00:18:20,209
Sheesh, I'm just inviting you to dinner.

180
00:18:20,397  -->  00:18:22,227
Why don't you eat at the dining area?

181
00:18:26,153  -->  00:18:29,563
If I try anything stupid, point that at me
and pull the trigger.

182
00:18:40,490  -->  00:18:41,547
Have a seat.

183
00:19:11,782  -->  00:19:14,326
Nice to meet you, Mylene.
I'm Martin, by the way.

184
00:19:19,206  -->  00:19:23,043
And there... At that moment,

185
00:19:23,168  -->  00:19:25,296
The end has begun.

186
00:20:01,081  -->  00:20:01,999
Is it good?

187
00:20:04,710  -->  00:20:05,836
Sure.

188
00:20:06,462  -->  00:20:08,881
I don't get to try
these dishes everyday, so

189
00:20:09,757  -->  00:20:11,258
I'm savoring every bite.

190
00:20:11,462  -->  00:20:12,213
Is that how it works?

191
00:20:12,238  -->  00:20:14,117
Do things taste better
when you rarely get to eat them?

192
00:20:14,595  -->  00:20:15,471
Duh.

193
00:20:20,184  -->  00:20:22,019
Is that why I don't scare you?

194
00:20:27,775  -->  00:20:30,235
With the number of men I've been with,

195
00:20:30,861  -->  00:20:32,696
there are many who are far more wicked,

196
00:20:33,197  -->  00:20:34,615
and far more attractive than you.

197
00:20:35,491  -->  00:20:37,117
You're not the only gangster around here.

198
00:20:38,118  -->  00:20:39,787
I'm not really a local.

199
00:20:40,079  -->  00:20:41,747
I'm from Manila. Tondo.

200
00:20:42,748  -->  00:20:44,333
But I got sick of that place.

201
00:20:45,042  -->  00:20:46,085
Here,

202
00:20:47,086  -->  00:20:49,838
the air is fresh, it's peaceful.

203
00:20:51,423  -->  00:20:52,399
What about you?

204
00:20:53,425  -->  00:20:55,219
It's obvious you're not a tourist.

205
00:20:57,407  -->  00:20:59,098
- What's your read?
- Scammer.

206
00:21:02,142  -->  00:21:03,430
You look like a scammer.

207
00:21:07,332  -->  00:21:08,583
Scammer...

208
00:21:09,875  -->  00:21:11,126
Want to order anything else?

209
00:21:11,151  -->  00:21:12,938
Dishes you've never tried before.

210
00:21:13,289  -->  00:21:14,248
Order all of them.

211
00:21:14,655  -->  00:21:16,281
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

212
00:21:30,879  -->  00:21:31,960
Hello, Jake!

213
00:21:32,774  -->  00:21:35,276
Take my order. Yeah, room service.

214
00:21:35,634  -->  00:21:37,678
For Casa Agua.

215
00:21:37,703  -->  00:21:41,640
- Mylene? What are you doing there?
- I want one more Crispy Pata,

216
00:21:42,641  -->  00:21:47,311
Bulalo, Steak,
and Assorted Fruits,

217
00:21:47,622  -->  00:21:49,916
Iced Tea, that's all.

218
00:21:50,399  -->  00:21:51,942
Oh, and Poqui-poqui.

219
00:21:53,808  -->  00:21:54,741
Alright!

220
00:21:55,696  -->  00:21:56,405
Yep.

221
00:22:00,242  -->  00:22:01,785
You worked up an appetite.

222
00:22:02,661  -->  00:22:05,122
You told me to order everything
I haven't tried on the menu.

223
00:22:23,715  -->  00:22:26,536
Maldives has recorded
its first corona virus case

224
00:22:26,561  -->  00:22:29,080
when two hotel employees
tested positive.

225
00:22:29,105  -->  00:22:31,436
The authorities would not name the hotel...

226
00:22:37,279  -->  00:22:38,913
Do you think the virus has reached here?

227
00:22:39,323  -->  00:22:40,574
As in this hotel?

228
00:22:40,941  -->  00:22:43,151
Some Chinese guests checked in here.

229
00:22:45,076  -->  00:22:46,494
Are you scared to die?

230
00:22:46,997  -->  00:22:49,374
I guess you aren't,
seeing as you already tried to.

231
00:22:49,984  -->  00:22:52,904
I'm not scared of some virus.
I'll slap that bitch.

232
00:22:53,462  -->  00:22:55,006
Sure you will.

233
00:22:56,608  -->  00:22:57,484
Hey, mister.

234
00:22:57,867  -->  00:23:01,460
You talk big for someone
who's holed up inside his hotel room.

235
00:23:01,570  -->  00:23:02,988
Who are you hiding from?

236
00:23:03,013  -->  00:23:04,431
What brings you here?

237
00:23:05,366  -->  00:23:06,159
The truth?

238
00:23:06,183  -->  00:23:08,561
Of course! No to fake news.

239
00:23:09,276  -->  00:23:11,570
I'm Congressman Velez's bagman.
Ever heard of him?

240
00:23:13,498  -->  00:23:15,417
Everyday I move bags of cash for him.

241
00:23:15,442  -->  00:23:18,070
A lot of cash, different transactions,
all illegal.

242
00:23:19,012  -->  00:23:20,847
Then one day it hits you,

243
00:23:20,872  -->  00:23:26,336
you're so sick of your life and you wonder,
“When will I ever be this filthy rich”?

244
00:23:29,096  -->  00:23:31,682
So I swindled the swindlers.

245
00:23:32,276  -->  00:23:35,613
But they got tipped off before
I even got far so now

246
00:23:35,796  -->  00:23:37,965
I'm wanted by Cong's men.

247
00:23:44,796  -->  00:23:47,883
You asked me a question,
I gave you a straight answer.

248
00:23:47,908  -->  00:23:49,368
Because you're full of shit.

249
00:23:49,526  -->  00:23:51,278
- You're a scammer.
- What'd you say?

250
00:23:51,562  -->  00:23:52,980
- You're a scammer.
- Me?

251
00:23:53,214  -->  00:23:54,006
Yep!

252
00:23:58,513  -->  00:23:59,681
What the heck.

253
00:24:09,475  -->  00:24:10,934
Want a slice of that?

254
00:24:20,482  -->  00:24:22,192
Are you crazy?
Dragging me into your shit!

255
00:24:22,217  -->  00:24:25,179
It's the end of the world, Mylene!
It's now or never!

256
00:25:54,721  -->  00:25:56,514
I should not be smoking cigarettes.

257
00:26:00,107  -->  00:26:02,985
But I treat myself with this one stick.

258
00:26:04,528  -->  00:26:07,406
One per month. Only nine left.

259
00:26:41,799  -->  00:26:46,679
But what use is waking up everyday?
Why do we go on living?

260
00:27:12,179  -->  00:27:12,929
Sir?

261
00:27:14,931  -->  00:27:15,682
Sir?

262
00:27:29,446  -->  00:27:30,197
Sir?

263
00:27:46,463  -->  00:27:47,214
Sir?

264
00:27:56,390  -->  00:27:57,140
Sir?

265
00:28:10,112  -->  00:28:10,862
Sir?

266
00:28:21,786  -->  00:28:23,705
You're concerned about me after all.

267
00:28:24,204  -->  00:28:26,122
Your room's still clean, yes?

268
00:28:28,922  -->  00:28:30,465
I'll get back to work.

269
00:28:33,924  -->  00:28:35,676
And can you not think too much?

270
00:28:35,846  -->  00:28:38,306
So you don't get any crazy ideas.

271
00:28:55,510  -->  00:28:57,527
Don't you have a sibling
who's studying in Manila?

272
00:28:57,552  -->  00:29:01,538
Yes, sir, I do. I should discuss
his trip with mother later.

273
00:29:01,563  -->  00:29:02,848
What about your mom, Princess?

274
00:29:02,873  -->  00:29:04,299
I'm chatting with her right now, sir.

275
00:29:12,757  -->  00:29:14,217
Sir, I quit.

276
00:29:15,594  -->  00:29:16,761
What did you say?

277
00:29:17,179  -->  00:29:18,555
I'm resigning.

278
00:29:19,055  -->  00:29:20,152
Why?

279
00:29:20,835  -->  00:29:22,879
It's the end of the world, sir.
It's now or never.

280
00:29:23,226  -->  00:29:23,810
Hey!

281
00:29:24,603  -->  00:29:26,563
I swear, that woman
is not right in the head.

282
00:29:26,602  -->  00:29:28,331
- My, have you gone crazy?
- Oh, no!

283
00:29:28,536  -->  00:29:30,705
You're not even three months into the job,
now you're leaving?

284
00:29:30,876  -->  00:29:33,211
What kind of reasoning is
"it's the end of the world"?

285
00:29:33,336  -->  00:29:34,087
Pull it together!

286
00:29:34,112  -->  00:29:35,910
Ditas, I'm just beating them to it.

287
00:29:36,214  -->  00:29:37,257
Pretty soon they'll be cutting their losses

288
00:29:37,282  -->  00:29:39,050
and have to let people go, I promise you.

289
00:29:39,160  -->  00:29:40,453
And haven't you noticed?

290
00:29:40,719  -->  00:29:43,263
The foreigners are scrambling
to get away from here.

291
00:29:43,288  -->  00:29:46,541
This must have something
to do with that new guest!

292
00:29:47,434  -->  00:29:50,187
Goddamnit, Mylene! What's wrong with you!

293
00:29:50,212  -->  00:29:52,122
You can't be lusting over that?

294
00:29:52,147  -->  00:29:53,774
He's no Prince Charming!

295
00:29:53,799  -->  00:29:55,125
And god, he's so dark!

296
00:29:55,150  -->  00:29:57,277
He looks like he's going to
beat you up every night!

297
00:29:57,302  -->  00:29:57,819
Hey!

298
00:29:58,181  -->  00:30:01,143
Hey, don't believe a word he says!
He's just tall, is all! My!

299
00:30:01,490  -->  00:30:04,368
My! He's not really a blondie! It's fake!

300
00:30:04,494  -->  00:30:06,970
I wanted to tell her,
“What the hell do you care”?

301
00:30:06,995  -->  00:30:09,056
Not even my own mom
gave two shits about me.

302
00:30:09,081  -->  00:30:10,707
She just dumped me in the streets.

303
00:30:10,919  -->  00:30:13,755
And get this- you should
have seen her face!

304
00:30:13,780  -->  00:30:15,115
She looked like an idiot!

305
00:30:15,517  -->  00:30:18,145
She was so shocked about what I did.

306
00:30:19,591  -->  00:30:20,509
Then what?

307
00:30:21,468  -->  00:30:22,386
Then what?

308
00:30:23,220  -->  00:30:25,555
Then what happened?
Your mom dumped you in the streets?

309
00:30:27,015  -->  00:30:29,142
I've already seen that on television.

310
00:30:30,310  -->  00:30:31,645
It's true!

311
00:30:33,063  -->  00:30:34,606
I grew up in an orphanage.

312
00:30:35,023  -->  00:30:36,024
No kidding.

313
00:30:37,025  -->  00:30:38,735
I got passed around a lot.

314
00:30:39,216  -->  00:30:41,880
The streets taught me all I know

315
00:30:41,905  -->  00:30:45,575
that's why men like you
don't scare me none.

316
00:30:46,451  -->  00:30:47,369
Then

317
00:30:47,494  -->  00:30:48,704
I became a prostitute.

318
00:30:48,954  -->  00:30:50,706
I worked the streets for ten years.

319
00:30:51,998  -->  00:30:54,559
But you know how it is.
Filthy. And it stinks.

320
00:30:54,584  -->  00:30:57,355
So here I am. Turning a new leaf.

321
00:30:59,715  -->  00:31:00,674
Look at you.

322
00:31:01,174  -->  00:31:04,094
You don't believe me.

323
00:31:06,221  -->  00:31:07,180
Hold on.

324
00:31:08,724  -->  00:31:10,517
I'll show you

325
00:31:11,601  -->  00:31:13,103
proof.

326
00:31:14,980  -->  00:31:15,897
Come here.

327
00:31:17,274  -->  00:31:18,400
Check this out.

328
00:31:21,027  -->  00:31:21,903
See?

329
00:31:22,779  -->  00:31:24,614
- Yeah?
- What's that?

330
00:31:25,066  -->  00:31:27,242
- Dang! That's me!
- Whoa!

331
00:31:27,367  -->  00:31:30,203
That's me! Gorgeous, right?

332
00:31:30,535  -->  00:31:33,373
- Wow.
- Aren't I gorgeous?

333
00:31:34,666  -->  00:31:39,746
I started out as a hostess,
then I got promoted to dancer.

334
00:31:39,771  -->  00:31:41,173
- There.
- Who are those?

335
00:31:41,212  -->  00:31:42,588
Look. They're girls
I work with at the club.

336
00:31:42,841  -->  00:31:45,510
I was twenty, a full-time stripper.

337
00:31:46,737  -->  00:31:48,739
- Your father?
- What, no.

338
00:31:48,764  -->  00:31:49,931
He's one of my patrons.

339
00:31:49,977  -->  00:31:51,437
I just didn't date him.

340
00:31:51,767  -->  00:31:53,518
Too bad though,
he has a lot of money.

341
00:31:54,144  -->  00:31:55,896
That's the downside of it.

342
00:31:56,062  -->  00:31:57,814
I was selling love

343
00:31:57,939  -->  00:32:00,066
but I had none left for myself.

344
00:32:00,525  -->  00:32:02,903
I didn't have time for love and all that.

345
00:32:04,362  -->  00:32:05,697
Yeah, right.

346
00:32:06,339  -->  00:32:08,300
- Yeah.
- You never had a boyfriend?

347
00:32:08,325  -->  00:32:09,409
Nope.

348
00:32:09,771  -->  00:32:10,719
I'm not kidding.

349
00:32:10,744  -->  00:32:13,079
How could I tell my boyfriend
that I’m a stripper?

350
00:32:15,123  -->  00:32:15,999
True love.

351
00:32:18,382  -->  00:32:19,258
Ouch!

352
00:32:19,432  -->  00:32:20,599
True love my ass.

353
00:32:21,630  -->  00:32:23,507
Did you quit your job

354
00:32:24,633  -->  00:32:26,051
to find a real lover?

355
00:32:27,886  -->  00:32:29,930
Who doesn't want true love?

356
00:32:30,639  -->  00:32:32,724
What about you,
don't you have someone?

357
00:32:32,749  -->  00:32:33,350
Huh?

358
00:32:34,559  -->  00:32:38,438
Ah, nevermind. It figures.

359
00:32:38,563  -->  00:32:40,065
That's why you…

360
00:32:46,238  -->  00:32:48,865
Why do you ask?
Are you attracted to me?

361
00:32:57,791  -->  00:33:00,126
I had someone. Abby.

362
00:33:01,294  -->  00:33:02,003
Abby.

363
00:33:02,387  -->  00:33:03,722
I got married to Abby.

364
00:33:07,175  -->  00:33:10,303
Then she left me
when she found out about my job.

365
00:33:14,766  -->  00:33:17,894
She took our son with her.

366
00:33:18,520  -->  00:33:19,437
Wait, what?

367
00:33:19,688  -->  00:33:20,605
You have a son?

368
00:33:20,730  -->  00:33:21,940
Yes, one.

369
00:33:22,357  -->  00:33:23,441
- Oh?
- A boy.

370
00:33:24,178  -->  00:33:24,887
Yeah,

371
00:33:25,055  -->  00:33:26,348
but they're not here anymore.

372
00:33:26,840  -->  00:33:28,217
They're all the way in Mindanao.

373
00:33:29,123  -->  00:33:30,250
Why Mindanao?

374
00:33:30,824  -->  00:33:33,368
Abby wanted to get him away from me.
That's what I don't--

375
00:33:34,786  -->  00:33:36,830
That's what I don't understand.

376
00:33:38,206  -->  00:33:40,417
She took him away for no reason.

377
00:33:43,837  -->  00:33:45,422
Or maybe there's a reason.

378
00:33:46,339  -->  00:33:47,632
Plenty of reasons.

379
00:33:50,093  -->  00:33:51,553
I just wasn't listening.

380
00:36:50,440  -->  00:36:53,683
What's your plan when your pursuers
track you down?

381
00:36:58,740  -->  00:36:59,991
Will you come with me?

382
00:37:01,993  -->  00:37:02,827
To where?

383
00:37:06,554  -->  00:37:08,306
To the end of the Philippines.

384
00:37:09,542  -->  00:37:11,419
Man, can you talk straight?

385
00:37:18,343  -->  00:37:20,637
Those morons won't catch up to me.

386
00:37:21,521  -->  00:37:23,481
They'll get tired of it soon enough.

387
00:37:25,572  -->  00:37:26,947
How long will you be staying here?

388
00:37:27,925  -->  00:37:30,075
Are you sure you want to be
cooped up in here?

389
00:37:30,436  -->  00:37:32,895
You're not even going out.
You're wasting the beach.

390
00:37:36,903  -->  00:37:38,071
What about you?

391
00:37:39,989  -->  00:37:40,782
Me?

392
00:37:43,493  -->  00:37:44,327
Nothing.

393
00:37:46,746  -->  00:37:49,707
Why did you quit your job
if you didn't plan on coming with me?

394
00:37:56,272  -->  00:37:58,649
Were you serious about splitting the money?

395
00:38:06,015  -->  00:38:07,058
Yeah, why?

396
00:38:09,435  -->  00:38:10,687
Just like that?

397
00:38:12,313  -->  00:38:13,773
You may not be a god, My,

398
00:38:15,454  -->  00:38:16,789
but you're an angel.

399
00:38:18,027  -->  00:38:19,988
The angel of my life.

400
00:38:25,118  -->  00:38:26,119
In that case,

401
00:38:29,372  -->  00:38:30,999
give me some of the cash.

402
00:38:32,876  -->  00:38:33,710
Sorry,

403
00:38:34,497  -->  00:38:35,498
I'm not an angel.

404
00:38:35,837  -->  00:38:38,840
Once a hoe, always a hoe.

405
00:38:39,757  -->  00:38:40,508
Wow.

406
00:38:42,635  -->  00:38:45,180
- What?
- I thought we had something real.

407
00:38:45,555  -->  00:38:48,766
Hey, don't fool yourself.

408
00:38:49,410  -->  00:38:52,162
Besides, I just want to be happy
even for a little while.

409
00:38:52,187  -->  00:38:54,063
I've never experienced that!

410
00:38:54,498  -->  00:38:55,875
And...

411
00:38:56,191  -->  00:38:57,567
It's easier to be happy

412
00:38:58,401  -->  00:38:59,777
when you have money.

413
00:39:00,528  -->  00:39:03,323
And isn't that what everybody wants?
To be happy?

414
00:39:04,824  -->  00:39:05,742
Sure.

415
00:39:05,992  -->  00:39:07,660
Even I just want to be happy.

416
00:40:25,967  -->  00:40:27,886
I'll step out for a bit
to get some clothes.

417
00:40:29,108  -->  00:40:30,192
You want something?

418
00:40:32,620  -->  00:40:33,329
No.

419
00:40:33,997  -->  00:40:34,998
Cigs.

420
00:40:36,624  -->  00:40:37,625
Thank you.

421
00:40:52,098  -->  00:40:54,350
I’m not sure if she’ll be coming back.

422
00:40:55,327  -->  00:40:56,912
All I did was hope.

423
00:40:57,905  -->  00:40:59,615
I need to cling to hope.

424
00:41:09,164  -->  00:41:10,791
I don't really pray.

425
00:41:11,902  -->  00:41:13,987
But I had to that night.

426
00:41:15,389  -->  00:41:17,224
Maybe I’m just that desperate.

427
00:41:43,636  -->  00:41:44,637
Hello, bro?

428
00:41:44,717  -->  00:41:47,837
Hello bro. I'm in
McArthur Highway already.

429
00:41:47,862  -->  00:41:49,113
You're close?

430
00:41:50,419  -->  00:41:51,879
Okay, okay. Thanks, bro.

431
00:41:52,147  -->  00:41:53,399
No problem.

432
00:42:28,277  -->  00:42:29,379
- Thanks, bro.
- Anytime.

433
00:42:29,404  -->  00:42:30,982
It's protocol. I got your back.

434
00:42:31,489  -->  00:42:32,907
When will you be back in Manila?

435
00:42:33,908  -->  00:42:36,911
My kids' classes are suspended
because of this darned Covid

436
00:42:36,936  -->  00:42:40,427
but Digong won't announce a lockdown.

437
00:42:41,582  -->  00:42:42,750
Well, I gotta get going, bro.

438
00:42:42,775  -->  00:42:45,152
Sure. Stay alert.
Don't get caught here.

439
00:43:23,368  -->  00:43:24,577
Like what you see?

440
00:43:25,084  -->  00:43:26,127
Gorgeous, huh?

441
00:43:28,087  -->  00:43:29,213
I have a new dress.

442
00:43:33,509  -->  00:43:34,719
Jeez, calm down!

443
00:43:35,178  -->  00:43:37,138
I wasn't gone for long.

444
00:43:37,638  -->  00:43:39,223
Seriously!

445
00:43:41,642  -->  00:43:44,420
I took a while because I bought
these button-down shirts,

446
00:43:44,445  -->  00:43:47,039
shorts, and other things you need.

447
00:43:47,064  -->  00:43:48,316
Look at this.
God, it's so cool.

448
00:43:48,341  -->  00:43:49,896
Here, here!

449
00:43:50,485  -->  00:43:51,569
It's a button-down.

450
00:43:52,349  -->  00:43:53,831
I got it for you.

451
00:43:53,856  -->  00:43:55,632
I bet it looks good on you,
check it!

452
00:43:55,843  -->  00:43:59,722
You have to try it on later. But let me
see your phone. Give it here.

453
00:43:59,869  -->  00:44:01,120
I'll save my number.

454
00:44:02,439  -->  00:44:03,398
Give me that.

455
00:44:03,998  -->  00:44:05,917
I forgot to give you my number.

456
00:44:07,084  -->  00:44:09,962
There. So when you want me for anything,

457
00:44:10,421  -->  00:44:12,349
Just give me a call.

458
00:44:17,261  -->  00:44:19,222
I had you worried for a second, huh?

459
00:44:20,306  -->  00:44:22,642
You thought I wasn't coming back?

460
00:44:23,226  -->  00:44:24,560
In love with me already?

461
00:44:28,314  -->  00:44:29,273
Madly.

462
00:44:30,858  -->  00:44:31,817
Christ.

463
00:44:32,326  -->  00:44:33,185
Get out of here.

464
00:44:33,865  -->  00:44:34,987
Check this out.

465
00:44:35,154  -->  00:44:37,240
Quickly! Try it on! Quickly! Come here.

466
00:44:38,699  -->  00:44:40,159
Try it on.

467
00:44:40,701  -->  00:44:42,370
I've been itching to see you in it.

468
00:44:43,204  -->  00:44:44,038
Try it on, quick!

469
00:44:44,580  -->  00:44:47,750
- Does it come in a different color?
- No! Try this on first. It looks so good.

470
00:44:49,210  -->  00:44:50,211
There we go.

471
00:44:50,795  -->  00:44:51,963
Looks so good.

472
00:44:52,380  -->  00:44:53,673
Get in there.

473
00:44:56,175  -->  00:44:57,176
Hoo!

474
00:45:03,516  -->  00:45:06,394
Damn, man.

475
00:45:06,852  -->  00:45:07,895
Hey!

476
00:45:09,021  -->  00:45:09,772
Yum!

477
00:45:42,680  -->  00:45:43,431
My?

478
00:45:44,296  -->  00:45:45,214
Hello, sir!

479
00:45:45,391  -->  00:45:46,434
Hi, Ditas!

480
00:45:46,459  -->  00:45:48,224
Hello ma'am.

481
00:45:49,061  -->  00:45:50,271
Towels?

482
00:45:52,064  -->  00:45:54,131
Have a great time!

483
00:46:18,562  -->  00:46:21,701
How does it feel every night,
you're in bed with a different--

484
00:46:23,473  -->  00:46:25,350
In bed with different guys?

485
00:46:27,152  -->  00:46:28,153
Nothing.

486
00:46:28,424  -->  00:46:29,508
It's just work.

487
00:46:29,898  -->  00:46:31,233
It's all psywar.

488
00:46:32,435  -->  00:46:35,249
Some people use their heads for work.

489
00:46:35,274  -->  00:46:39,810
Some people use their hands.
I use my whole body.

490
00:46:41,822  -->  00:46:43,074
You're a scammer, too.

491
00:46:44,825  -->  00:46:46,743
I sell wild fantasies, that's it!

492
00:46:49,893  -->  00:46:51,561
Must be good to be out of the game.

493
00:46:52,966  -->  00:46:54,133
It sure is.

494
00:46:55,628  -->  00:46:56,796
Same with you.

495
00:46:57,549  -->  00:46:59,176
Are you out for good?

496
00:47:03,031  -->  00:47:04,866
I hope so, too.
If I can get away with it.

497
00:47:06,101  -->  00:47:07,895
I wish the world would stop turning.

498
00:47:13,177  -->  00:47:14,480
I hope so, too.

499
00:47:18,577  -->  00:47:20,287
Fine, I'm coming with you.

500
00:47:22,193  -->  00:47:24,414
To the end of the Philippines.

501
00:47:42,670  -->  00:47:44,485
- Almost there.
- It's so far.

502
00:47:44,510  -->  00:47:48,347
- It's so far. You blindfolded me ages ago.
- No, we're almost there.

503
00:47:49,177  -->  00:47:50,808
- Come over here.
- Should I remove it?

504
00:47:50,833  -->  00:47:52,193
No, don't! Don't remove it!

505
00:47:52,218  -->  00:47:52,959
Okay.

506
00:47:55,062  -->  00:47:55,980
Are you ready?

507
00:47:56,188  -->  00:47:57,064
Yeah.

508
00:47:57,189  -->  00:47:58,065
Okay.

509
00:47:59,455  -->  00:48:01,999
Okay, one, two...

510
00:48:02,085  -->  00:48:02,715
Three!

511
00:48:02,740  -->  00:48:04,974
Happy Anniversary!

512
00:48:05,114  -->  00:48:07,158
Happy Anniversary!

513
00:48:09,946  -->  00:48:10,822
What's this?

514
00:48:12,079  -->  00:48:15,458
It's our 25th anniversary,
did you forget?

515
00:48:16,443  -->  00:48:21,213
- Ah, okay. Okay, 25 years.
- Yeah.

516
00:48:21,238  -->  00:48:22,490
How old are we?

517
00:48:24,049  -->  00:48:25,551
Doesn't matter.
We don't age. Come on.

518
00:48:25,873  -->  00:48:26,791
Let's sit there.

519
00:48:26,942  -->  00:48:27,985
Alright, sure.

520
00:48:28,189  -->  00:48:29,023
Where's your spot?

521
00:48:29,064  -->  00:48:31,323
- Here's money. Bring out the lobster.
- Oh, thank you!

522
00:48:31,348  -->  00:48:32,266
Hurry, lay it on the table.

523
00:48:32,308  -->  00:48:32,808
Where are you sitting?

524
00:48:32,850  -->  00:48:33,934
- That's you. Right there.
- Alright.

525
00:48:33,959  -->  00:48:38,581
And because it's our anniversary,
I'd like to reminisce...

526
00:48:38,606  -->  00:48:40,900
The first time we met.

527
00:48:41,317  -->  00:48:43,110
Alright, remind me.

528
00:48:43,193  -->  00:48:45,946
- I was wearing a red dress.
- Oh, yeah.

529
00:48:46,071  -->  00:48:49,366
Red dress, red lips,
red shoes, red everything.

530
00:48:49,492  -->  00:48:52,036
You picked up my shoes
and chased after me.

531
00:48:52,061  -->  00:48:54,205
But I didn't see you, I kept on running.

532
00:48:54,330  -->  00:48:56,140
Running, running,
then you called out,

533
00:48:56,165  -->  00:48:58,667
"Missy! Missy! Your shoes, Missy!"

534
00:48:58,692  -->  00:48:59,943
Because that was in Italy.

535
00:49:00,638  -->  00:49:01,786
Oh, I see.

536
00:49:02,220  -->  00:49:03,554
- Wow.
- Lombardy!

537
00:49:03,923  -->  00:49:04,673
Where?

538
00:49:05,101  -->  00:49:06,603
- Somewhere in Italy.
- Ah.

539
00:49:06,628  -->  00:49:07,651
It was in Italy.

540
00:49:07,676  -->  00:49:11,138
Then I said, "I think we've met..."

541
00:49:12,640  -->  00:49:14,809
- …"before."
- Yeah?

542
00:49:30,803  -->  00:49:34,432
Those days, he was
the most important thing

543
00:49:38,283  -->  00:49:40,868
and we were the only people
left in the world.

544
00:50:20,457  -->  00:50:25,087
Those days, she was
the most important thing

545
00:50:26,213  -->  00:50:30,342
and it felt like we're the last
people on Earth.

546
00:50:42,813  -->  00:50:50,029
The appropriate procedures in containing
the citizens and the virus are in effect.

547
00:50:50,112  -->  00:50:55,075
Citizens who disobey said procedures
may be imprisoned

548
00:50:55,200  -->  00:50:57,161
for one to six months.

549
00:50:57,244  -->  00:51:02,249
Citizens may also be fined for
20,000 to 50,000 pesos.

550
00:51:02,705  -->  00:51:07,961
Meanwhile, in the United States,
cases continue to increase.

551
00:51:08,505  -->  00:51:13,469
New York City is now the epicenter
with more than 50 cases reported.

552
00:51:24,355  -->  00:51:26,065
My, are you ready yet?

553
00:51:28,359  -->  00:51:30,110
Huh? Yes.

554
00:51:31,362  -->  00:51:35,324
Yeah. I'll be right out.
Go reserve a spot for us.

555
00:51:38,535  -->  00:51:40,454
My, we're the only guests here.

556
00:51:41,664  -->  00:51:43,165
Let's go, I'll wait for you.

557
00:51:44,500  -->  00:51:45,834
Huh?

558
00:51:47,252  -->  00:51:48,671
I want steak.

559
00:51:50,089  -->  00:51:53,759
Yeah, and… get our order in
so when I'm done, it'll be ready, okay?

560
00:51:54,301  -->  00:51:55,511
Okay, then.

561
00:51:56,011  -->  00:51:57,388
I'll see you there.

562
00:52:40,055  -->  00:52:42,891
My, is everything alright?
Why were you in there for so long?

563
00:52:42,916  -->  00:52:44,000
Are you okay?

564
00:52:44,048  -->  00:52:44,715
Huh?

565
00:52:44,950  -->  00:52:47,119
No, I'm okay.
I just made myself pretty.

566
00:52:48,266  -->  00:52:49,349
Look. Is it pretty?

567
00:52:50,315  -->  00:52:52,276
You don't even have to try.

568
00:52:55,983  -->  00:52:57,735
- You're already pretty.
- You think so?

569
00:52:58,282  -->  00:52:59,533
Should I have the steak brought out?

570
00:52:59,658  -->  00:53:03,120
Ah, no, it's fine. You started drinking.
I'll start drinking, too.

571
00:53:03,145  -->  00:53:04,480
- Whoop, hold on.
- Mark!

572
00:53:04,997  -->  00:53:06,123
Let's get that for you.

573
00:53:07,207  -->  00:53:08,333
Okay, okay.

574
00:53:12,504  -->  00:53:14,423
- Thank you!
- Mark's still working.

575
00:53:14,590  -->  00:53:16,091
- What's his name? Mark?
- Mark.

576
00:53:16,800  -->  00:53:17,760
Cheers.

577
00:53:18,135  -->  00:53:19,386
What should we toast to?

578
00:53:19,511  -->  00:53:20,387
The end of the world!

579
00:53:22,848  -->  00:53:25,993
- Okay, a toast to the end of the world!
- To the end of the world!

580
00:53:26,018  -->  00:53:26,685
Cheers.

581
00:53:40,908  -->  00:53:42,034
Let's dance.

582
00:53:42,263  -->  00:53:42,847
Huh?

583
00:53:42,993  -->  00:53:43,869
Let's dance.

584
00:53:43,894  -->  00:53:47,389
- I don't dance. There's no music.
- Come on! No, we're dancing.

585
00:53:47,414  -->  00:53:48,807

I thought we had a protocol, bro.

623
00:57:50,798  -->  00:57:53,617
Bro, you didn’t tell me
that you upsetted the Cong.

624
00:57:53,952  -->  00:57:57,205
I’ll be the one taking the hit
if I didn’t tell him where you are.

625
00:57:57,413  -->  00:57:59,248
You’re already lucky to have me

626
00:57:59,273  -->  00:58:00,817
because I’m giving you warnings.

627
00:58:01,269  -->  00:58:03,312
Don't you call me bro
right now, bastard!

628
00:58:03,337  -->  00:58:06,234
If I ever see you,
I'll shoot you myself.

629
00:58:07,174  -->  00:58:09,151
Have a seat.

630
00:58:09,176  -->  00:58:10,552
I’ll attend to your order.

631
00:58:10,577  -->  00:58:11,578
Okay, yes, cuz. Thank you.

632
00:58:12,066  -->  00:58:13,025
She's my cousin.

633
00:58:13,455  -->  00:58:15,040
Working here at Playa.

634
00:58:15,065  -->  00:58:19,343
Ah, yes. She seems familiar.

635
00:58:23,372  -->  00:58:26,166
There aren't many guests left.

636
00:58:34,242  -->  00:58:35,369
Ah, spiced pork liver.

637
00:58:35,394  -->  00:58:37,188
That's delicious.
Try our local recipe.

638
00:58:37,403  -->  00:58:39,430
That’s Playa’s special recipe.

639
00:58:40,214  -->  00:58:41,382
It does look good.

640
00:58:42,000  -->  00:58:43,293
How long will you be staying for?

641
00:58:45,310  -->  00:58:47,724
Ah, we'll be on our way soon.

642
00:58:48,405  -->  00:58:51,526
You should drop by the beautiful
attractions here in Ilocos Norte.

643
00:58:51,551  -->  00:58:53,487
Pagudpud, windmill,
and what was that, bro?

644
00:58:53,512  -->  00:58:56,640
- La Birhen Milagrosa of Badoc.
- Yes, La Birhen Milagrosa in Badoc.

645
00:58:57,192  -->  00:58:58,651
We'll be sure to drop by.

646
00:58:58,850  -->  00:59:00,660
Order some more.
Try the Halo-halo.

647
00:59:00,685  -->  00:59:02,270
We have the best desserts in Ilocos Norte.

648
00:59:03,363  -->  00:59:04,414
Let's eat, sir!

649
00:59:04,439  -->  00:59:05,607
Ah, yes! Thank you!

650
00:59:09,903  -->  00:59:10,529
Eat up.

651
00:59:33,093  -->  00:59:34,386
Mylene, where's my gun?

652
00:59:39,724  -->  00:59:41,184
Where did you put my gun?

653
00:59:41,351  -->  00:59:42,978
Huh? I need it.

654
00:59:45,647  -->  00:59:47,232
I'm asking you.
Where's my gun?!

655
00:59:47,257  -->  00:59:48,717
You don't need it anymore!

656
00:59:49,586  -->  00:59:50,877
You don't need it anymore, Martin!

657
00:59:50,902  -->  00:59:53,655
You're carrying your past with you
as long as you have a gun on you!

658
01:00:05,584  -->  01:00:07,043
I have a target on my back.

659
01:00:08,753  -->  01:00:10,338
They're on my trail.

660
01:00:12,966  -->  01:00:15,177
They're going to kill me
if I don't go back to them.

661
01:00:18,388  -->  01:00:20,640
But damn those bastards,

662
01:00:21,057  -->  01:00:23,143
they won't catch me alive.

663
01:00:28,491  -->  01:00:30,285
I no longer say my prayers

664
01:00:30,770  -->  01:00:33,106
but I tried to find God
during those times.

665
01:00:37,464  -->  01:00:40,050
I need to know what is life for.

666
01:00:41,017  -->  01:00:44,562
I need to know how He chooses to smite
those who sinned.

667
01:01:24,406  -->  01:01:26,158
Who is to be saved?

668
01:01:26,696  -->  01:01:29,490
Would a lover's plea be enough?

669
01:02:14,254  -->  01:02:17,282
PRESIDENT: I am now
addressing the nation

670
01:02:17,307  -->  01:02:25,180
together with the civilian,
military and police sectors.

671
01:02:26,831  -->  01:02:30,126
The organizations that would count

672
01:02:30,465  -->  01:02:34,841
in our enforcement of the laws
to protect the people

673
01:02:34,866  -->  01:02:37,266
of the Republic of the Philippines.

674
01:02:39,606  -->  01:02:42,943
Pardon my broken Tagalog.

675
01:02:43,617  -->  01:02:48,705
For our fellow countrymen,
we stand together.

676
01:02:50,287  -->  01:02:52,449
Do not panic.

677
01:02:52,941  -->  01:02:55,617
Do not be stressed

678
01:02:56,254  -->  01:03:03,345
of being unable to do what you want.

679
01:03:04,861  -->  01:03:08,949
You may but with proper restrictions.

680
01:03:10,330  -->  01:03:14,668
There are conditions due to the crisis.

681
01:03:15,382  -->  01:03:19,136
The crisis is very, very clear.

682
01:03:19,548  -->  01:03:26,242
Covid-19 is spreading
althroughout the country

683
01:03:26,267  -->  01:03:29,586
including the Philippines.

684
01:03:57,649  -->  01:03:59,025
This is too much, sir.

685
01:04:00,733  -->  01:04:01,525
Please take it.

686
01:04:01,797  -->  01:04:03,157
- Really? Okay.
- Thank you, sir.

687
01:04:21,271  -->  01:04:24,065
The common restroom is at the back.

688
01:04:30,765  -->  01:04:32,267
Sorry about this, Mylene.

689
01:04:32,553  -->  01:04:34,972
We need to lie low for now.

690
01:04:36,675  -->  01:04:38,593
We’re not going to stay here for long.

691
01:05:04,450  -->  01:05:06,869
Congressman wasn't my first boss.

692
01:05:11,014  -->  01:05:13,683
I've dispatched
and killed countless men.

693
01:05:17,395  -->  01:05:19,898
I know I've earned a spot in hell.

694
01:05:29,574  -->  01:05:30,992
All my life

695
01:05:33,241  -->  01:05:35,493
I've been transacting with demons.

696
01:05:40,168  -->  01:05:41,961
So when I met Abby,

697
01:05:43,171  -->  01:05:44,672
I hid everything from her.

698
01:05:45,193  -->  01:05:46,403
Especially my job.

699
01:05:51,137  -->  01:05:54,349
I protected them from all of it
but it didn't last.

700
01:05:58,736  -->  01:06:00,196
They had to get away from me.

701
01:06:09,009  -->  01:06:10,844
It's probably for the best.

702
01:06:31,104  -->  01:06:33,523
If you want to leave me, too, Mylene,
I would understand.

703
01:07:28,280  -->  01:07:29,949
This is what I've always dreamed of.

704
01:07:31,863  -->  01:07:33,406
To be a fisherman.

705
01:07:35,204  -->  01:07:37,415
I'll row out far
into the sea at dawn

706
01:07:37,980  -->  01:07:39,690
to get a hefty catch.

707
01:07:41,160  -->  01:07:43,287
And when I come back in the afternoon,

708
01:07:44,500  -->  01:07:47,420
you'll be there waiting for me,
you're with our child.

709
01:07:47,961  -->  01:07:50,162
A small kid's holding your hand,
she looks like you.

710
01:07:54,036  -->  01:07:55,162
Like me?

711
01:07:56,027  -->  01:07:57,904
All of our children will look like you.

712
01:07:59,213  -->  01:08:00,631
Then

713
01:08:01,113  -->  01:08:03,365
I'll show you my catch,

714
01:08:04,030  -->  01:08:05,573
it's ready for grilling.

715
01:08:06,383  -->  01:08:07,933
Then you'll say, "Just
simmer it in vinegar!"

716
01:08:07,958  -->  01:08:08,969
Because you're hungry.

717
01:08:13,655  -->  01:08:15,239
That sounds nice.

718
01:08:16,923  -->  01:08:18,800
Simple, but happy.

719
01:08:19,827  -->  01:08:21,329
Is that alright with you?

720
01:09:50,585  -->  01:09:52,834
Hello? Hello, Niko?

721
01:09:53,386  -->  01:09:55,722
How are you? This is your daddy.

722
01:09:56,507  -->  01:09:58,009
I miss you so much.

723
01:09:58,900  -->  01:10:00,026
Daddy?

724
01:10:00,280  -->  01:10:03,158
You're not my Daddy.
My Papa's right here.

725
01:10:03,892  -->  01:10:05,059
Papa!

726
01:10:05,474  -->  01:10:08,250
Hello? Niko, what are you doing
with my phone?

727
01:10:09,536  -->  01:10:12,076
Hello, sorry. My son
answered the phone.

728
01:10:12,513  -->  01:10:13,556
Who's calling?

729
01:10:16,694  -->  01:10:19,322
Abby, I know you don't want
to talk to me.

730
01:10:19,413  -->  01:10:21,021
Martin? Why are you so persistent?

731
01:10:21,046  -->  01:10:22,798
You even used a different number.

732
01:10:25,434  -->  01:10:28,312
Abby, please hear me out.
Don't hang up the phone.

733
01:10:30,147  -->  01:10:33,067
I just wanted to tell you that
I won't bother you anymore.

734
01:10:37,965  -->  01:10:39,842
I'll leave you and Niko in peace.

735
01:10:43,724  -->  01:10:46,107
I just wanted to ask for forgiveness
for everything I did.

736
01:10:46,494  -->  01:10:48,373
There's no need for that, Martin.

737
01:10:49,032  -->  01:10:50,732
I've sworn you out of our lives
a long time ago.

738
01:10:50,757  -->  01:10:52,052
That's good enough.

739
01:10:52,623  -->  01:10:54,041
I'll change my number.

740
01:10:54,463  -->  01:10:57,732
And if you'll keep harrassing us,
I'll put you in jail.

741
01:10:57,983  -->  01:11:00,646
That is, if you're not already there.

742
01:11:32,144  -->  01:11:33,312
Mylene?

743
01:11:38,264  -->  01:11:39,598
Mylene, are you okay?

744
01:11:42,476  -->  01:11:43,310
My?

745
01:11:58,843  -->  01:12:00,970
Hey, you don't need to do that.
You're beautiful.

746
01:12:00,995  -->  01:12:02,455
My…

747
01:12:03,789  -->  01:12:04,707
Wha-

748
01:12:06,028  -->  01:12:07,571
Mylene. Where are you going?

749
01:12:08,627  -->  01:12:10,341
Hey, wait up. Don't--

750
01:12:10,595  -->  01:12:12,138
What's the hurry? Mylene!

751
01:12:12,965  -->  01:12:15,092
Did I say something wrong?
I’m sorry! Hey!

752
01:12:15,342  -->  01:12:17,094
What did I say? Tell me.

753
01:12:19,555  -->  01:12:20,264
My!

754
01:12:20,598  -->  01:12:22,058
Go on, put on your lipstick!

755
01:12:22,391  -->  01:12:23,184
If you want-

756
01:12:23,562  -->  01:12:25,105
do whatever you want! Mylene!

757
01:12:25,352  -->  01:12:26,562
My, wait up!

758
01:12:27,325  -->  01:12:29,377
Wait. What is your problem?

759
01:12:33,069  -->  01:12:34,153
What's the matter?

760
01:12:40,868  -->  01:12:42,870
I have pancreatic cancer.

761
01:12:49,934  -->  01:12:52,144
The doctor said I only have a year left.

762
01:12:53,781  -->  01:12:57,243
It's the real reason why
I moved here from Manila.

763
01:12:58,552  -->  01:13:00,054
The reason why I wanted to get away.

764
01:13:00,179  -->  01:13:03,516
It's probably why
I came here with you, too.

765
01:13:05,142  -->  01:13:07,394
Because I've got nothing to lose

766
01:13:08,562  -->  01:13:10,606
if I took a chance on anybody.

767
01:13:27,206  -->  01:13:27,915
What?

768
01:13:30,336  -->  01:13:31,963
What kind of made-up story is that?

769
01:13:44,974  -->  01:13:46,427
We're going back to Manila, alright?

770
01:13:46,600  -->  01:13:47,685
We're going back to Manila.

771
01:13:48,227  -->  01:13:51,897
We'll take you to the best hospital
and get a brilliant doctor.

772
01:13:52,310  -->  01:13:53,916
We have a lot of money. You'll live!

773
01:13:53,941  -->  01:13:55,373
Then you'll die?

774
01:13:55,626  -->  01:13:58,504
You'll get killed when
they finally get to you!

775
01:13:58,529  -->  01:14:03,427
Screw them, Mylene!
Screw them!

776
01:14:05,488  -->  01:14:07,573
Shit, Mylene…

777
01:14:10,833  -->  01:14:12,960
I'll bet my life on it,

778
01:14:13,210  -->  01:14:15,004
I'll sell my soul to the devil.

779
01:14:16,046  -->  01:14:18,048
I'll do anything, Mylene.

780
01:14:18,315  -->  01:14:21,318
Anything. You will live!

781
01:14:21,343  -->  01:14:24,430
Stop it. Martin, stop it. Stop this!

782
01:14:24,655  -->  01:14:28,033
There's nothing anyone can do,
no medicine,

783
01:14:28,058  -->  01:14:30,269
there's nothing more to be done!

784
01:14:34,190  -->  01:14:36,692
Martin, you'll create
your own heaven on earth.

785
01:14:38,402  -->  01:14:42,406
You'll create your own, hm?

786
01:14:44,158  -->  01:14:48,621
Don't hold on to me.
Don't hold on to me.

787
01:15:10,517  -->  01:15:13,270
Yet people always find a way.

788
01:15:15,314  -->  01:15:18,108
Once they face death

789
01:15:18,133  -->  01:15:20,718
and take responsibility
for their own actions.

790
01:17:28,030  -->  01:17:30,032
You just had to give us
a hard time, Martin.

791
01:17:30,491  -->  01:17:32,659
Now you're crawling back to us.

792
01:17:32,785  -->  01:17:35,621
Be grateful that you're important to Cong.

793
01:17:36,580  -->  01:17:37,952
You should know

794
01:17:38,536  -->  01:17:40,188
you're not getting away with it
without a scratch.

795
01:17:41,329  -->  01:17:42,747
I know that.

796
01:17:43,873  -->  01:17:46,167
That's why I'll do everything
he wants me to.

797
01:17:46,192  -->  01:17:47,276
As you should!

798
01:17:48,092  -->  01:17:50,427
Not everyone gets a second chance, bro.

799
01:18:34,309  -->  01:18:35,383
Martin?

800
01:18:50,529  -->  01:18:51,280
Martin...

801
01:18:51,811  -->  01:18:52,937
Keep driving.

802
01:18:53,570  -->  01:18:54,696
Go straight.

803
01:19:03,463  -->  01:19:04,422
Martin!

804
01:19:04,779  -->  01:19:06,197
Go straight. Don't stop.

805
01:19:06,462  -->  01:19:08,380
But you need help!

806
01:19:10,549  -->  01:19:12,551
They won't catch me alive.

807
01:19:16,254  -->  01:19:18,907
Son of a bitch!
I’m an action star.

808
01:19:18,932  -->  01:19:21,018
Don't talk like that,
what's wrong with you!

809
01:19:50,594  -->  01:19:52,263
What is life for?

810
01:19:54,218  -->  01:19:57,054
Isn’t it for love?

811
01:20:55,632  -->  01:20:56,674
Don't.

812
01:20:57,948  -->  01:20:58,991
Don't move too much.

813
01:20:59,957  -->  01:21:01,750
I just wrapped your wound.

814
01:21:25,934  -->  01:21:28,478
You told me to keep driving.

815
01:21:28,937  -->  01:21:30,272
Straight ahead.

816
01:21:39,740  -->  01:21:41,825
To the end of the Philippines.

817
01:21:45,834  -->  01:21:47,545
Somewhere by the sea.

818
01:21:50,375  -->  01:21:52,336
We will live in your dream.
