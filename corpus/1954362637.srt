36
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:17,192
- Why do us sit back here?

00:04:36,683 --> 00:04:39,037
Just saying, you ought to have a game, Russell.

00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:41,180
Pick it for me, girls are away from home...

G'morning, Gubber.

It's Gunnar, actually.

52
00:05:04,313 --> 00:05:07,166
- Gunnar.
- Very smooth.

53
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:09,366
- You shut up.
- Gubber...

Ah-ha-ha... Yeah... You tickled that tits!
Oh, boy! Good for you, boy!

<i>- Neckless and ruthless!

- Yeah, you can't say even masturbating, can you?</i>

58
00:05:33,653 --> 00:05:39,539
Hey, Kimberly! You look exhausted. We could be...
should... take a break or something?

59
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,540
And do what?

60
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,024
Not even if your balls pumped free vodka!

61
00:05:47,324 --> 00:05:49,044
Don't even think about it!

62
00:05:49,645 --> 00:05:50,645
What?

63
00:05:50,646 --> 00:05:52,488
It's wearing a promise ring, dubshit.

64
00:05:52,489 --> 00:05:55,231
I promised my Daddy to be a virgin until 30.

65
00:05:55,932 --> 00:05:58,240
Ok, I didn't say anything.

66
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:00,184
But I know that you've been thinking.

67
00:06:22,873 --> 00:06:23,872
Hey, dude?

68
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,723
I don't understand this stuff, can you help here?

69
00:06:35,611 --> 00:06:37,709
Yeah, sure... Just outside.

70
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,609
Ok.

71
00:06:49,505 --> 00:06:53,301
- Do I get everything wrong?
- No... Ah...

72
00:06:53,302 --> 00:06:57,188
I think you got the date right... I'm kidding.

73
00:06:57,189 --> 00:07:00,407
- Ah...
- That's wrong too... It's 27-th.

74
00:07:02,507 --> 00:07:05,805
- This is impossible.
- Not really.

75
00:07:06,305 --> 00:07:10,103
Ah... So... What are you looking for is hard black chips...

76
00:07:10,104 --> 00:07:16,288
with... oh... without a mud. And judging
by what you describe in your journal...

77
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:18,998
...you basically found a lot of rocks today.

78
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:20,398
Wait.

79
00:07:22,198 --> 00:07:26,284
- This is not a fossil?
- No, rock.

80
00:07:27,384 --> 00:07:31,047
But... That's awesome if you got a rock collection at home?

81
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:33,714
- I don't think.
- And I think so.

82
00:07:34,714 --> 00:07:37,365
So... ah... I merely tell you what's are right...

83
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:40,188
...and you gonna describe fossils you'd... you never found.

84
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:45,873
Yeah? Thanks, man. I... I just
cannot afford to fail this class.

85
00:07:45,874 --> 00:07:46,873
Wrong end?

86
00:07:46,874 --> 00:07:50,821
No, they are... allow me play
football if I show good grades.

87
00:07:50,822 --> 00:07:53,938
No offense, but I would never come to sciences for fun.

88
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:56,067
You know me... It's just... not my thing.

89
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:57,977
Yeah, I sure.

90
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,576
- You're ready?
- Yeah.

91
00:08:02,576 --> 00:08:06,788
Ok. Ah... hmm... so let's see here...
I think you describe here...

92
00:08:15,284 --> 00:08:18,456
Min, I'd feel like free spiders.
This thing is crowning with it.

93
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:21,065
Do you announce to me to break about?
They're living things, Gunnar.

94
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:23,754
Yeah? Counting cats your people eat for breakfast?

95
00:08:23,755 --> 00:08:26,729
Ah, that is a Vietnamese tradition. I am Chinese, asshole!

96
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,062
- Yeah.
- Ah... Kill it! Oh!..

97

00:09:02,487 --> 00:09:04,788
- Hey.
- Very good.

100
00:09:05,288 --> 00:09:06,231
I can tell.

101
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,841
Hey, we had a game going along about that box.

102
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:10,917
Hmm...

103
00:09:10,943 --> 00:09:13,794
Ah, it's... it's not a say championship but...
it's gonna be fun.

104
00:09:13,795 --> 00:09:14,894
Sounds cool.

105
00:09:16,594 --> 00:09:18,360
Wipe your face up, it's embarrassing.

106
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,135
Sure, bright.

107
00:09:21,335 --> 00:09:23,443
I'm to faint... Too much running...

108
00:09:23,444 --> 00:09:24,842
Hang in there, big guy. Last play.

109
00:09:24,843 --> 00:09:27,720
- We gonna lose.
- We need more one-touch way to win.

110
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:30,418
- No, he's right. This is impossible.
- Hey, guys, focus!

111
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:32,344
Leave to me alone.

112
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:35,362
Then I figure that to Russell... task be... cover.
Think you can carry it?

113
00:09:35,388 --> 00:09:36,116
Ah...

114
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,117
Good.

115
00:09:38,617 --> 00:09:40,016
Win! Ready?

116
00:09:50,312 --> 00:09:51,311
Ready!

117
00:09:57,609 --> 00:09:58,609
Go, go, go!

118
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:16,001
Come clean.

119
00:10:16,901 --> 00:10:17,901
What?

120
00:10:17,902 --> 00:10:21,004
Bravy dudes do not have that
atletic-like ability of nowhere.

121
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:24,813
I run track freshman sophomore year.

122
00:10:24,814 --> 00:10:26,601
Call this like a that counting.

123
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,899
How long it's gonna pour?

124
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,663
Don't be a chick. It's just only a rain.

125
00:10:35,763 --> 00:10:36,763
Fine.

126
00:10:37,463 --> 00:10:42,337
- What are you writing?
- Nothing, just... fixing your report.

127
00:10:42,838 --> 00:10:45,890
Well, not fixing my...

128
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:48,524
You've always been so smart?

129
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:51,132
I'm not much that smart, actually.

130
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:53,842
Just gonna obsesse with entering of good college.

131
00:10:53,843 --> 00:10:57,152
- Why?
- My Dad has a plan for me.

132
00:10:57,153 --> 00:11:00,007
And getting into Yale is part of that plan.

133
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:04,370
You're "cannot kiss ass" sort.

134
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:06,570
No, I'm not! I...

135
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,181
Why are you wake in your football so much, er?

136
00:11:10,182 --> 00:11:13,566
Should you just complying your Dad's expectations also?

137
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:16,184
Positive. Play 'cause I love it.

138
00:11:17,684 --> 00:11:19,673
Whatever... if you gonna judge me I won't help.

139
00:11:19,674 --> 00:11:20,874
Hey!

140
00:11:24,273 --> 00:11:25,672
I'm not judging.

141
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,860
Oh, wow!

Yes, Terian, I like to touch everyone

Ok?

159
00:15:39,185 --> 00:15:42,336
Today we begin our first long-term assignment.

160
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:47,467
- Parenty.
- I'm too young to be a Mommy.

161
00:15:47,768 --> 00:15:51,399
For me babies are like... marshmallows.

162
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:56,095
But let's not discriminate. In some cases
we brought chocolate marshmallows.

163
00:15:56,995 --> 00:16:00,516
- Right, Ike?
- Come again, honey?

164
00:16:00,517 --> 00:16:04,224
The soft delicate things that we just
gonna hold them and squeeze them...

165
00:16:09,623 --> 00:16:10,888
Was that you, Nolan?

166
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:13,998
- Me?
- Ah-ha.

167
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:19,672
- No, no, Mom. It was not.
- Then why are you missing a shoe?

168
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:25,070
Oh... You're also missing a shoe. Both of them, actually.

169
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,797
Oh, that's true, and I would love to tell you all about...

170
00:16:28,798 --> 00:16:32,366

00:16:39,808 --> 00:16:41,655
...one of these babies to take care of.

174
00:16:41,656 --> 00:16:46,927
You learn watch it, feed it, cloth
it and at end of the quater...

175
00:16:46,928 --> 00:16:51,545
...will do a presentation along with your partner...
to let us know about your experience.

176
00:16:57,043 --> 00:16:59,840
Ah... I can't believe we have
that work together on this thing.

177
00:16:59,841 --> 00:17:01,585
We were at the same table.

178
00:17:02,585 --> 00:17:04,843
It could be worse, Brian Bund is a single parent.

179
00:17:04,844 --> 00:17:06,143
True that.

180
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:15,687
- What are you doing?
- What? Bring it away.

181
00:17:15,688 --> 00:17:16,844
- Gunnar!
- What?

182
00:17:16,845 --> 00:17:18,986
- You gonna kill it.
- I'm not gonna kill it.

183
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:21,785
- Bad mommy.
- I'm not a bad mommy!

184
00:17:21,786 --> 00:17:23,350
- You're a horrible mommy.
- I'm a great mommy.

185
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:39,776
<i>GEOGRAPHY CLUB</i>

186
00:17:45,074 --> 00:17:46,771
Nah... I can not decide. Ike?

187
00:17:46,772 --> 00:17:50,479
- He totally has DQF. It's a 's'.
- What's DQF?

188
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,913
Dark Queen Face.

189
00:17:51,914 --> 00:17:54,102
It is when a that guy has naturally thin eyelashes...

190
00:17:54,103 --> 00:17:55,733
...and super pronounced cheekbones.

191
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:58,465
Oh! My Dad totally has that.

192
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:03,563
Hey.

193
00:18:04,864 --> 00:18:07,083
- Hey.
- Glad you came.

194
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:13,667
I'm... I don't mean to be rude but... what is this?..

195
00:18:13,668 --> 00:18:14,668
I will explain...

196
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:16,965
Because the sign on the door says 'Geography club'...

197
00:18:16,966 --> 00:18:18,365
- I know....
- And I don't see any maps...

198
00:18:18,366 --> 00:18:21,832
- Russell? I knew it.
- Hey...

199
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:26,729
- He knew what?
- This is not a geography club.

200
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,050
- That's obvious.
- Oh... We are a group...

201
00:18:29,051 --> 00:18:33,548
- Like a band?..
- Like a secret support group.

202
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:35,747
For what?

203
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:38,745
For gay teens.

204
00:18:41,634 --> 00:18:42,933
You have no right.

205
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:47,296
- Russell, stop.
- Why do you do that?

206
00:18:47,297 --> 00:18:48,909
- Russell, just listen...
- No.

207
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:52,460
- I treat me and now they know that I'm...
- Gay?

208
00:18:52,461 --> 00:18:54,750
I don't know... ok?.. I don't know what I am...

209
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:56,159
...and it's not your business anyway.

210
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,562
You're right. And whatever you decide
to do I would not say anything.

211
00:18:59,563 --> 00:19:01,033
About either of you.

212
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:07,730
You do know it just because you saw what happened.
It doesn't mean you get to say.

213
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:12,217
I'm really sorry, Russell. But, please,
just come inside, check it out...

214
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:15,225
You stay out of my shit, alright?

215
00:19:16,725 --> 00:19:19,724
- It was nothing.
- Yeah?

216
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:23,646
She just wanted to say that we've
got nothing to worry about.

217
00:19:23,647 --> 00:19:25,908
- For real?
- Does it matter?

218
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:29,152
You're right... You're right!

219
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,806
Ah... Dude, I was almost hallucinating.

220
00:19:35,206 --> 00:19:38,713
That day at the park... Was that you?

221
00:19:38,714 --> 00:19:41,612
'Cause it just... some coincidence?

222
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:46,433
No, I... I recognized you from school.

223
00:19:46,934 --> 00:19:51,530
- I was gonna say something... you know... I just a...
- Freaked down.

224
00:19:51,531 --> 00:19:56,005
- Exactly.
- And then you made me feel like a complete idiot. Ok, then.

225
00:19:56,006 --> 00:19:57,603
Russell... you know... I'm sorry.

226
00:19:57,604 --> 00:20:02,311
I am. I'm just... Wait a second! Wait... Wait a second.

227
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,534
What's this?

228
00:20:07,735 --> 00:20:10,521
I want to hang out with you. In school and stuff.

229
00:20:11,322 --> 00:20:12,321
Ok.

230
00:20:12,322 --> 00:20:14,239
But I don't... but I don't want people gain suspicious.

231
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,492
You know, like, "What are they doing
together outside?", you know.

232
00:20:18,493 --> 00:20:24,889
- So... you got me a jersey?
- No. I got you joined team.

233
00:20:32,086 --> 00:20:33,685
- Good morning.
- Morning.

234
00:20:33,686 --> 00:20:35,373
So I thought to ride to school together today.

235
00:20:35,374 --> 00:20:38,862
Ah... cool. Ah... what's that?

236
00:20:40,062 --> 00:20:43,829
- Ah... That is Florence Carsi.
- Ah... You named it Flo?

237
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,003
Yeah, after my grandmother Florence.

238
00:20:46,004 --> 00:20:47,903
So lame.

239
00:20:47,904 --> 00:20:49,103
It's not lame!

240
00:20:51,303 --> 00:20:55,974
Air is crisp, my friend! Crisp.

241
00:20:55,975 --> 00:20:57,507
Why are you so happy this morning?

242
00:20:57,508 --> 00:21:01,082
No, nothing. You know, just Kimberly
said she goin' on date with me.

243
00:21:01,983 --> 00:21:03,769
So what made you to finally change her mind?

244
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,857
No, no. It's just she came out with her senses.

245
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:09,057
It's awesome, man!

246
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:14,453
Oh, and... Kimberly also said that I ought to
come along with her friend Trish or canceling it.

247
00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:17,218
- No way!
- Oh, come on, Russell!

248
00:21:17,219 --> 00:21:18,318
I do not wanna to do that!

249
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,748
Why? Because she wears a promise ring?

250
00:21:19,749 --> 00:21:21,116
Who cares? Trish is hot!

251
00:21:21,117 --> 00:21:23,228
I don't care! The answer is 'No'.

252
00:21:25,928 --> 00:21:30,255
- What the hell are you doing?
- Russell... You have to do this for me.

253
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:33,065
- Friend, it's all that ever matters!
- Well, I do not wanna...

254
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:36,162
Please... Please, I'm begging you as a friend!

255
00:21:36,163 --> 00:21:40,042
If I go on date with Kimberly...
For the first time in my life

256
00:21:40,068 --> 00:21:44,184
I will have a girlfriend.
How, do you know, important is that for me?

257
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:48,291
Ok.

258
00:21:49,992 --> 00:21:52,243
- Oh, dude, thank you very much!
- No problem.

259
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,444

00:23:33,102 --> 00:23:35,598
Feel I aged Arina last night good?

285
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:39,671
So my Mom finds me in my room... and
tells me she's gonna give me $100.

286
00:23:39,672 --> 00:23:40,412
Nice!

287
00:23:40,413 --> 00:23:43,585
But says I'm only allowed to buy a dress with it.

288
00:23:43,586 --> 00:23:47,472
That girl as pretty as me shouldn't
be wearing jeans all the time.

289
00:23:47,473 --> 00:23:49,472
Ok, or maybe she's just trying to be nice?

290
00:23:49,473 --> 00:23:51,571
Or maybe she's just trying to be a bitch.

291
00:23:51,572 --> 00:23:54,480
- Do you think that's bad? Listen to this.
- What?... Ah...

292
00:23:54,481 --> 00:23:57,579
- Upsi... Yeah...
- Upsi...

293
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:02,266
So, after weeks of talking this boy
online, we finally met up. Hmm.

294
00:24:02,267 --> 00:24:05,764
So what I think: let's see how far I can take this.

295
00:24:05,765 --> 00:24:10,472
Then I'm all. I mean to put my hands
down his pants and see what happens.

296
00:24:10,473 --> 00:24:12,926
- And here's a surprise!
- Big package?

297
00:24:12,927 --> 00:24:14,778
- Try no package.
- What?

298
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:17,107
- He was totally a 'she'.
- Look, ok... I don't get it.

299
00:24:17,108 --> 00:24:20,576
He's this girl. Her name is Samanta. She is a les.

300
00:24:20,577 --> 00:24:22,465
When she told her parents, they hit the road.

301
00:24:22,466 --> 00:24:26,062
She came back a day later and told
them that she was just confused...

302
00:24:26,063 --> 00:24:29,951
...and approved to them she'd go out
and promised to find a boyfriend.

303
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,185
I know, tragic, right?

304
00:24:32,186 --> 00:24:34,031
She said she did not want a straight dude...

305
00:24:34,032 --> 00:24:36,025
...said she felt safe with a gay guy instead.

306
00:24:36,026 --> 00:24:38,857
I mean, I did tell her that I
was 80-20, but she didn't mind.

307
00:24:38,858 --> 00:24:39,857
80-20?

308
00:24:39,858 --> 00:24:41,757
80% straight, 20% gay.

309
00:24:42,258 --> 00:24:45,076
- Ok.
- So what happened?

310
00:24:47,176 --> 00:24:51,450
We went and got coffee. Talked for hours. Beach is fierce.

311
00:24:52,251 --> 00:24:55,698
So I'm gonna be her fake boyfriend until
she figures it's just a wish now.

312
00:24:55,699 --> 00:24:58,579
- It's awesome, dude!
- It's really cool.

313
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,370
Well, I have an exam which to prepare.

314
00:25:00,371 --> 00:25:02,224
- Ah... I can help a little.
- Thanks.

315
00:25:07,022 --> 00:25:11,061
Hey... I'm... just curious. What
made you decide to come back?

316
00:25:11,062 --> 00:25:17,047
I don't know... You're like not telling anyone, are you?

317
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:18,970
You know about us, too.

318
00:25:44,634 --> 00:25:45,745
It's tideous.

319
00:25:54,941 --> 00:25:56,540
5 minutes late!

320
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:05,013
- Hi, Russell.
- Hi, Trish.

321
00:26:07,012 --> 00:26:09,843
I bet you are great at bowling.

322
00:26:10,305 --> 00:26:11,509
I'm ok.

323
00:26:16,307 --> 00:26:17,306
Yeah!

324
00:26:27,944 --> 00:26:28,943
Thought that we gained cheese?

325
00:26:28,944 --> 00:26:33,142
- They ran out of cheese... So...
- That's ok, Gunnar.

326
00:26:33,143 --> 00:26:34,143
It is?

327
00:26:34,144 --> 00:26:37,396
Well, I can go and... slice a pizza that's got cheese on it.

328
00:26:37,397 --> 00:26:40,272
No, no, forget it! I'm not even... hungry... anymore...

329
00:26:48,168 --> 00:26:51,711
- They're actually pretty good.
- Give me.

330
00:26:55,909 --> 00:27:00,817
Oh... oh, so... delicious.

331
00:27:09,114 --> 00:27:11,477
- I love the burn.
- Apple tea?

332
00:27:11,778 --> 00:27:15,475
- Ah-ha... Pure vodka.
- Hot.

333
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:24,038
- That's a while and I gain a car.
- When?

334
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:26,808
Well... it's not official... but...
my birthday's coming up...

335
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:29,635
...and I told my Daddy he should give me a car...
so... here you are.

336
00:27:31,035 --> 00:27:32,434
I mean, you'd better.

337
00:27:34,035 --> 00:27:36,021
It's my 17-th birthday. I think I've earned that.

338
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:38,498
- Don't you think I've earned it?
- I think I'm totally on you.

339
00:27:38,499 --> 00:27:39,899
Oh... I know... Alright...

340
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,971
- Am I paraphrasing?
- Totally.

341
00:27:44,671 --> 00:27:46,593
Ah... Is that a good thing?..

342
00:27:46,594 --> 00:27:49,751
Do you take me to Tommy? Do you know what I mean, do you?

343
00:27:49,852 --> 00:27:50,557
Kinda.

344
00:27:55,156 --> 00:27:57,243
Excuse me, I'm going to girls room.

345
00:28:02,341 --> 00:28:05,561
- Dude, she's perfect.
- Yeah, totally...

346
00:28:05,562 --> 00:28:11,836
- Ah... Can we borrow your car?
- Yeah, yeah. You can...

347
00:28:11,837 --> 00:28:14,390
You just... guys... be safe, all right? It's my Dad's car.

348
00:28:14,391 --> 00:28:17,532
Yes... Thank you, Gunnar. You're awesome.

349
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:21,875
- Ah... I don't have my license...
- It's alright, I will drive.

350
00:28:21,876 --> 00:28:24,639
- Where... where're we going?
- Do not worry.

351
00:28:36,134 --> 00:28:39,843
- What are we doing here?
- What do you mean?

352
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:43,474
Ah... Don't you think it's a little... creepy?

353
00:28:46,874 --> 00:28:51,235
- I like feel it's private.
- It's creepy.

354
00:28:51,236 --> 00:28:53,514
Hold on, I turn on the headlights, silly.

355
00:28:56,314 --> 00:28:57,913
I'm not doin' nothing!

356
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:09,626
So... ah... what's... what's your favorite movie?

357
00:29:09,627 --> 00:29:14,247
I don't know. That's such out of question.

358
00:29:15,748 --> 00:29:21,200
- If you had to choose...
- "The Case of Door Mansion"!

359
00:29:21,201 --> 00:29:26,307
Where everyday play detectives and
resolve every crime by dinner time.

360
00:29:27,707 --> 00:29:29,207
What about you?

361
00:29:32,506 --> 00:29:35,312
- "Dirty Harry."
- Sounds great.

362
00:29:35,313 --> 00:29:37,557
I love "dirty".

363
00:29:43,555 --> 00:29:46,253
- I can hear your heart beating.
- You can?

364
00:29:47,053 --> 00:29:49,118
You're nervous, I can tell.

365
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:51,294
- What?
- Relax.

366
00:29:52,495 --> 00:29:56,302
Ah... I'm confused... Ah, that... That was a promise ring.

367
00:29:58,801 --> 00:30:02,090
Ups... What happens in Vegas...

368
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,090
We are not even in Vegas...

369
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,289
Bullshit!

370
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,097
- Who are that?
- The homeless dude.

371
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:11,384
- Let him watch.
- What?

372
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:17,381
- What's wrong?
- I don't know...

373
00:30:17,881 --> 00:30:20,580
Ah... Nothing, I just...

374
00:30:21,281 --> 00:30:25,376
- I do not think that we should...
- What?

375
00:30:25,377 --> 00:30:29,763
- You know.
- Why not?

376
00:30:29,764 --> 00:30:33,928
Well... ah... we don't have any condoms... so...

377
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:38,448
Well, I didn't say I want to have sex with you, no deny?

378
00:30:40,148 --> 00:30:42,492
Ah... But if you do want, I have one in my purse.

379
00:30:42,493 --> 00:30:44,367
- No, I can't.
- You can't?

380
00:30:44,368 --> 00:30:45,267
Right.

381
00:30:45,368 --> 00:30:47,665
Oh, like you can't erect up?

382
00:30:47,666 --> 00:30:50,819
- What? No!
- I'm confused.

383
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:58,816
Ah... I'm just a... I'm... I'm a virgin. So I...
I wanna my first time to be special.

384
00:31:00,604 --> 00:31:04,956
You're great, but... you... just don't... feel right...

385
00:31:04,957 --> 00:31:08,199
I mean... by me it doesn't feel right.

386
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,953
You are... You are perfectly fine.

387
00:31:12,153 --> 00:31:16,260
I get it. I wanna my first time to be special too.

388
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,314
Russell Middlebrook, you're a romantic.

389
00:31:34,508 --> 00:31:36,308
What am I doing?

390
00:32:37,118 --> 00:32:38,931
So it's what happen.

391
00:32:38,932 --> 00:32:42,506
I'm standing there and thinking,
"What the hell am I doing here?"

392
00:32:42,507 --> 00:32:46,492
You know, I've tryed play football
before, but this is a whole other thing.

393
00:32:46,493 --> 00:32:50,901
Coach, is he likes what he seeing. He's
gonna take a chance. He's gonna start me.

394
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,967
- Say why.
- I know, right?

395
00:32:52,968 --> 00:32:56,643
So the game starts. I'm freaking out.

396
00:33:16,957 --> 00:33:17,477
Oh, you ready?

397
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:19,587
I can not believe you grabbed me on the team.

398
00:33:19,588 --> 00:33:22,274
Well, you gonna be the best player I know.

399
00:33:22,275 --> 00:33:25,073
- Come on!
- That's where I got confused.

400
00:33:25,074 --> 00:33:28,827
I thought that Kevin got me on the team so
just he can make me excuse to hangout...

401
00:33:28,828 --> 00:33:31,270
Anything... that's part of it, but...

402
00:33:31,271 --> 00:33:36,855
...at that moment... I realized I
actually thought like a player.

403
00:33:36,856 --> 00:33:39,255
He believed in me as a football player.

404
00:33:39,256 --> 00:33:42,654
And... I don't know why... but it got me pumped.

405
00:33:42,655 --> 00:33:45,063
Anyways, before I knew it we were in fourth quart...

406
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:49,061
...and... at this point I'm feeling it...
should I... I'm desperate away.

407
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,759
And just why I thought about the game in the bag.

408
00:34:07,652 --> 00:34:09,051
They scored.

409
00:34:36,752 --> 00:34:38,490
We needed a touchdown to win.

410
00:34:38,491 --> 00:34:42,089
And we hadn't any time in fact, we only had one thing left.

411
00:34:46,787 --> 00:34:48,129
Middlebrook, you think you do it?

412
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,129
I can do it.

413
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,672
Good. All I wanna a won, ready?

414
00:35:48,298 --> 00:35:49,542
We won.

415
00:35:49,543 --> 00:35:50,996
- Well done!
- I was saying it!

416
00:35:50,997 --> 00:35:54,940
I know, I know... I was going crazy...
and everyone was cheering for me and...

417
00:35:54,941 --> 00:35:59,359
...I just keeped to thinking, this
night can not be getting better.

418
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,990
But I was wrong... It did.

419
00:36:30,876 --> 00:36:33,419
- That was incredible.
- Thanks.

420
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,819
You made it, Russell.

421
00:36:43,516 --> 00:36:46,545
School football thing is bringing us closer.

422
00:36:46,546 --> 00:36:50,043
I mean... Sometimes you can be such an ass... like...

423
00:36:50,044 --> 00:36:53,852
...sort of thing... I'm coming over him... but...

424
00:36:53,853 --> 00:36:57,928
...it all gets sweet and... I might arose before.

425
00:37:02,327 --> 00:37:04,147
I'd like to join the Geography club.

426
00:37:08,746 --> 00:37:10,722
- Dude!
- Hey, guys.

427
00:37:10,723 --> 00:37:14,853
Well done, bro! Seriously, I
can't believe you brought it up.

428
00:37:14,854 --> 00:37:17,362
- Thanks.
- Madness skills for real.

429
00:37:17,363 --> 00:37:19,273
Come on, the game was days ago.

430
00:37:19,274 --> 00:37:21,305
- Besides, a team effort...
- Not that.

431
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,904
Dude, Trish.

432
00:37:24,305 --> 00:37:25,904
Yeah, we heard you nailed her.

433
00:37:25,905 --> 00:37:29,156
- Who told you that?
- No embarrassment. How's whore going to be?..

434
00:37:29,157 --> 00:37:31,600
- She's not a whore.
- What a shit?

435
00:37:31,601 --> 00:37:34,198
Can just degrade another kids female like that!

436
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:35,599
It's not cool.

437
00:37:36,499 --> 00:37:40,595
Sorry, man. She's not a whore. I am.

438
00:37:40,596 --> 00:37:42,050
- Thanks.
- Middlebrook?

439
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:45,148
- Hey.
- Everybody in town is talking you about it.

440
00:37:45,149 --> 00:37:47,292
- Everyone knows?
- They were there.

441
00:37:48,092 --> 00:37:50,146
- What?
- The game.

442
00:37:50,647 --> 00:37:52,734
- Right, yeah.
- What else, mate?

443
00:37:52,735 --> 00:37:54,588
All of them will never forget a play like that.

444
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:57,141
- Yeah, of course.
- Not even my parents.

445
00:37:57,142 --> 00:37:59,930
- They wanna meet the new star.
- Yeah?

446
00:37:59,931 --> 00:38:01,749
Dinner at my place on Friday night, you alright?

447
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,865
Kev's mom's a doc cook...

448
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:06,437
I mean room is place as a kitchen, am I right?

449
00:38:08,836 --> 00:38:11,368
- You're retarded.
- What?

450
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:13,323
Yes, sounds good. Come in.

451
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:14,324
Cool.

452
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,428
And at the end you buy a cake, right?

453
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:29,170
Kevin was only in 3 at the time... Oh, no, wait, he was 4.

454
00:38:29,171 --> 00:38:31,228
Oh, wait, no, no, he was 3, right?

455
00:38:31,229 --> 00:38:34,651
Anyway, the pressure point is that
he never would have noticed...

456
00:38:34,652 --> 00:38:38,309
that it was overflowered - it is birthday
cake, - but the guests certainly would have.

457
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:40,859
The party is only as good as its host...

458
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,108
...and the host is only as good as your cake.

459
00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:44,307
Yeah, I've entirely did it.

460
00:38:44,308 --> 00:38:46,767
Nobody likes a stale treat. That's what happens...

461
00:38:46,768 --> 00:38:49,226
We use too much flowers and kids are all tough.

462
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:50,127
But they're not that.

463
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:51,613
Oh, that's why I use mixers now.

464
00:38:51,614 --> 00:38:54,046
I make room for it. That's the truth.

465
00:38:54,047 --> 00:38:56,699
Baking from scratch... It's just not worth it.

466
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:01,158
- I agree.
- Hey, have some more.

467
00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:02,758
Oh, thank you.

468
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:06,706
- Russell.
- Yes, sir.

469
00:39:09,206 --> 00:39:11,005
Where you've been hiding, son?

470
00:39:12,405 --> 00:39:13,605
Ah... Excuse me?

471
00:39:15,305 --> 00:39:19,099
Where you've been hiding?.. All these years...

472
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,064
I'd never seen you at any football team before.

473
00:39:25,164 --> 00:39:28,428
I've not been hiding... I've
just didn't think I could do it.

474
00:39:30,528 --> 00:39:32,315
He didn't think he could do it.

475
00:39:36,514 --> 00:39:38,423
We got a nickname for you, son.

476
00:39:39,123 --> 00:39:40,865
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

477
00:39:41,866 --> 00:39:44,320
- Flash.
- Flash?

478
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:50,627
After that Flash, comin' to famous for its running.

479
00:39:51,528 --> 00:39:55,080
Well... that's... that's really cool nickname.

480
00:39:55,081 --> 00:39:57,789
- Kevin told it me.
- You did?
- Hmm.

481
00:40:04,286 --> 00:40:07,074
- Hey, Flash?
- Yes, sir?

482
00:40:09,474 --> 00:40:10,673
I like you, son.

483
00:40:11,673 --> 00:40:13,060
Thank you, sir.

484
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,292
Hey, maybe you should come to church with
us this weekend. Meet the whole family.

485
00:40:18,868 --> 00:40:20,067
What do you mean 'the whole family'?

486
00:40:20,068 --> 00:40:21,556
Your uncle Glenn comes to the town.

487
00:40:21,557 --> 00:40:23,854
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

488
00:40:25,754 --> 00:40:29,366
He's introducing us to his new boyfriend, Eddie...

489
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:33,150
Your uncle says he may be the one.

490
00:40:33,151 --> 00:40:37,007
Says he's be sure for the actually.

491
00:40:45,304 --> 00:40:50,841
- So you coming, Flash?
- Ah... yeah... yes, sir. I'd love to go.

492
00:40:50,842 --> 00:40:52,706
Well, fella boy.

493
00:40:55,606 --> 00:40:58,592
- Why is he doing this?
- Doing what? You cause it overreactive.

494
00:40:58,593 --> 00:41:00,935
If Brian comes back to you, what's one we can not join.

495
00:41:01,036 --> 00:41:04,434
No club is allowed to turn anyone away.
We are obliged to take him.

496
00:41:04,435 --> 00:41:05,943
Thought noone wanted to join.

497
00:41:05,944 --> 00:41:07,452
So why you guys named it Geography club?

498
00:41:07,453 --> 00:41:10,651
Know, we chose it because it's boring.
We didn't think anyone actually come.

499
00:41:10,652 --> 00:41:13,540
Anyways, I don't see why you guys are so scared of...

500
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:16,150
...and maybe we should open this club...
or... make it known.

501
00:41:16,151 --> 00:41:17,704
- No, no way!
- Why not?

502
00:41:17,705 --> 00:41:19,486
I do not want the whole school know about me.

503
00:41:19,487 --> 00:41:22,425
For real, I already got messed up with 170% straight.

504
00:41:22,426 --> 00:41:24,178
We got to be ourselfs here.

505
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:26,999
Should we mind other kids looking of the same thing?

506
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,199
Oh, shit.

507
00:41:38,695 --> 00:41:44,613
I don't really care about the Geography.
I already have a 10 in Geography so...

508
00:41:47,613 --> 00:41:50,684
...thought about joining this club for
a while just to make friends but...

509
00:41:50,685 --> 00:41:52,409
...I was scared.

510
00:41:54,109 --> 00:41:56,984
Little people laugh of me, I'm not stupid.

511
00:42:02,182 --> 00:42:06,702
Thing is... I don't wanna go home after school.

512
00:42:07,502 --> 00:42:09,555
I'm scared of it, actually.

513
00:42:11,055 --> 00:42:15,485
So I play the cello... I play it when I'm nervous.

514
00:42:16,585 --> 00:42:18,605
It's what I do all night... playing the cello.

515
00:42:23,004 --> 00:42:25,891
When I'm nervous, little much my fingers twist.

516
00:42:32,588 --> 00:42:35,432
Oh... I just don't wanna go home after school also...

517
00:42:37,032 --> 00:42:39,884
...nor I can force you be my friend or... so...

518
00:42:43,683 --> 00:42:46,436
Don't worry about your secret. I'm not gonna tell anybody.

519
00:43:02,728 --> 00:43:07,170
So be honest... do you think I'm
a good football player, do you?

520
00:43:07,171 --> 00:43:09,469
Yeah, absolutely.

521
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:13,911
Wait... do you think maybe one day I can win the Heimen?

522
00:43:13,912 --> 00:43:17,420
- Whats?
- It's called the Husman, you shit tard.

523
00:43:17,421 --> 00:43:20,974
- Shut it, alright?
- Hey.

524
00:43:20,975 --> 00:43:24,794
- Hey.
- Have you seen Ike? He left his phone in my car.

525
00:43:24,795 --> 00:43:28,574
- Ah... No.
- Oh... Ok.

526
00:43:28,575 --> 00:43:32,757
- Sorry.
- Are you coming today?

527
00:43:32,758 --> 00:43:35,889
I don't know. Maybe... See you later.

528
00:43:38,689 --> 00:43:42,651
Let me guess. One drunken night and
suddenly she thinks you two are dating.

529
00:43:42,652 --> 00:43:46,194
- Exactly.
- Ah-ha... What a thing...

530
00:43:46,195 --> 00:43:48,248
Now be careful 'cause it's all muddy.

531
00:43:48,249 --> 00:43:50,181
- Would you just relax?
- Be a magic.

532
00:43:50,182 --> 00:43:52,411
- Why just paint it black?
- Stay...

533
00:43:52,412 --> 00:43:53,335
Stay still.

534
00:43:53,336 --> 00:43:54,855
- I'm not moving.
- Stay still!

535
00:43:55,856 --> 00:43:59,003
- Hey, did you guys read this?
- The school newspaper?.. Eu...

536
00:43:59,004 --> 00:44:03,351
Ah... Eeverybody is reading today.
Mrs.Toles gave a controversial interview.

537
00:44:03,352 --> 00:44:06,070
- The health teacher?
- Yeah.
- What did she say?

538
00:44:06,071 --> 00:44:11,347
It talked about feelings and sex education and how
she was for a condom machine in school bathrooms.

539
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:14,934
It also talked about the time she
put condoms on cucumbers in class.

540
00:44:14,935 --> 00:44:18,122
Today we can be working with wide variety of vegetables.

541
00:44:18,123 --> 00:44:22,351
We got 2 cucumbers and of cause we have squash and cukini.

542
00:44:22,352 --> 00:44:25,606
They now appear to represent the genetically unlucky.

543
00:44:25,907 --> 00:44:28,928
It's well as those in probably other areas.

544
00:44:32,227 --> 00:44:35,179
It would bring about ravishes to put in the background.

545
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:38,533
But listen to this... Wait... where is Russell?

546
00:44:38,534 --> 00:44:42,032
- He's not answering his phone.
- What an ass...

547
00:44:42,033 --> 00:44:47,931
Ah... anyway. "No one student complained to me
about my condom exercises," said Mrs. Toles.

548
00:44:47,932 --> 00:44:50,416
"In fact three students came up to thank me."

549
00:44:50,417 --> 00:44:52,161
So what is this have to do with us?

550
00:44:52,162 --> 00:44:56,479
"As a health educator, it's my job to
teach all the students," Toles said.

551
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,923
According to Toles, that even includes gay students.

552
00:45:00,123 --> 00:45:04,964
"There are gay and lesbian students at every
high school in the town, including ours."

553
00:45:04,965 --> 00:45:08,907
"Just last week I talked to one of them
about support group for gay teens."

554
00:45:08,908 --> 00:45:13,581
"The world is changing every day and I think
it's a phenomenal idea to estate it."

555
00:45:13,582 --> 00:45:19,801
"When the school board found that she gave
this interview, Mrs. Toles was... suspended."

556
00:45:21,801 --> 00:45:26,931
Now I'm guessing not an interview would have gonna
up to Ms. Toles to suggest a gay support group.

557
00:45:30,031 --> 00:45:34,149
Guys, there are others like us at this
school and they're looking a place to go.

558
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:35,904
I'm not ready to be an outcast.

559
00:45:35,905 --> 00:45:39,651
For real, there is no acceptance
for a 50-50 guy in this school.

560
00:45:40,352 --> 00:45:43,666
You're whether being so selfish very now?

561
00:45:43,667 --> 00:45:48,520
I mean, I never know I can date
girl who only cares about yourself.

562
00:45:48,521 --> 00:45:52,394
Ba... I can't believe you just burried that.

563
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:08,087
Gently... grab the ankles of the child with one hand...
and raise its both... out of the diaper.

564
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:14,873
- Dude, this is retarded.
- Just do it.

565
00:46:14,874 --> 00:46:17,548
- Why me?
- Because you're the Mom.

566
00:46:17,549 --> 00:46:19,281
- I am the Mom?
- Yeah...

567
00:46:19,282 --> 00:46:21,846
- And that so... means you are the Dad?
- Exactly.

568
00:46:21,847 --> 00:46:26,965
- Oh... How am I end up the Mom?
- Ah... 'cause your man boobs, Gunnar...

569
00:46:26,966 --> 00:46:30,598
- An obvious.
- You're such an asshole.

570
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:35,261
Ok... let us see... take a... take a
wipe and clean with the baby's oil.

571
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,559
- Hey, not be cool?
- What's that?

572
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,858
Kimberly's parents have this really cool lake house and...

573
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:47,156
she thought it we would be totally
cool if we gotta this weekend.

574
00:46:47,157 --> 00:46:52,197
Trish will be there too... so...
won't it just be the coolest?

575
00:46:57,971 --> 00:47:00,104
Yeah... just... just keep the
baby's bottom up while you wipe...

576
00:47:00,105 --> 00:47:02,647
- Russell, please.
- ... near 3... 4... wipes...
- You!

577
00:47:02,648 --> 00:47:05,580
- What's?...
- Why don't you wanna go?

578
00:47:05,581 --> 00:47:08,445
- I just don't.
- Trish is so hot and she's into you...

579
00:47:08,446 --> 00:47:14,442
Yeah, I know but... she's too cleany... and
everyone at school thinks that we had sex.

580
00:47:14,443 --> 00:47:16,375
Yeah, I don't see what's wrong with that.

581
00:47:16,376 --> 00:47:19,379
I'm not going... so... whatever...

582
00:47:21,379 --> 00:47:25,877
Ah... as we used to take up dirty
and put it on the bed... so...

583
00:47:25,878 --> 00:47:28,611
You know this is so unfair!

584
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:31,872
Now on the one second we're best
buds, and on the next--

585
00:47:31,898 --> 00:47:35,642
you're Mr. Popular Football Guy.
And you not even noticed that I lost 10 pounds.

586
00:47:35,643 --> 00:47:38,049
- I want skinny jeans, dude...
- I did notice.

587
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:39,350
You did not notice!

588
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:45,120
Look... Kimberly is the one thing,
Russell, the one thing that I truely

589
00:47:45,146 --> 00:47:49,170

so obsessed you don't give a shit.

590
00:47:53,934 --> 00:47:55,454
Fuck you, Russell!

591
00:48:09,648 --> 00:48:12,132
Man, that is won't I take baby toy.

592
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,815
- I already come with you.
- No, no, you don't have to...

593
00:48:24,816 --> 00:48:27,548
- No, no, it's fine...
- Yes! Sweet!

594
00:48:46,938 --> 00:48:50,532
- See this sports bra?
- Yeah.

595
00:48:50,533 --> 00:48:51,932
It's my sister's.

596
00:48:54,032 --> 00:48:56,998
Look at him. He loves this.

597
00:49:02,596 --> 00:49:05,284
Take it. Do not be pussy, dude!

598
00:49:08,983 --> 00:49:14,923
- Put it on!
- Why?

599
00:49:14,924 --> 00:49:17,632
It's our role. You're part of team, bro.

600
00:49:28,328 --> 00:49:31,125
Yeah, that is a talent.

601
00:49:31,126 --> 00:49:32,369
Let's get him out then.

602
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:53,759
That's enough, everybody!

603
00:51:06,954 --> 00:51:10,964
And we are here.

604
00:51:11,964 --> 00:51:13,327
This place's tight.

605
00:51:14,028 --> 00:51:19,813
Yeah, it's been in my family as for alike...
a long period of years.

606
00:51:19,814 --> 00:51:21,679
Isn't it place awesome, baby-cake?

00:51:23,379 --> 00:51:26,378

608

Yeah, totally magical.

609
00:51:29,109 --> 00:51:32,907
Ah... hey, won't you ladies go inside...
and we will be there behind you?

610
00:51:33,908 --> 00:51:35,016
- Fine.

611
00:51:35,017 --> 00:51:37,904
- Don't be long, boys.
- Yeah, we won't.

612
00:51:40,303 --> 00:51:43,112
- What the hell, dude?
- What?

613
00:51:43,113 --> 00:51:48,110
- You're acting weird.
- Oh... sorry. It's... it's been a bad day.

614
00:51:48,111 --> 00:51:51,441
Alright, just... just be homeman, ok?

615
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,641
Alright, Gunnar. What would you say.

616
00:51:53,642 --> 00:51:56,815
I'm serious. Russell, don't screw this up for me.

617
00:52:06,311 --> 00:52:08,699
- Who's ready to start drinking?
- Me!

618
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,322
- Yes.
- And do you like weights?

619

620
00:52:17,185 --> 00:52:18,982
- Hey, Trish?
- Yeah.

621
00:52:19,183 --> 00:52:22,126
Isn't Mr. Donaldson like totally veinable?

622
00:52:22,426 --> 00:52:23,926
No, it's not.

623
00:52:23,927 --> 00:52:25,999
Oh, come on, he's such a lookable muffin.

624
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,078
Muffin is a something you leak, Kimberly.

625
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:30,078
Yeah.

626
00:52:37,875 --> 00:52:39,175
That's rude.

627
00:52:42,274 --> 00:52:45,070
My hands are cold. May I can have frozed by?...

00:52:45,071 --> 00:52:47,167

629
00:52:47,168 --> 00:52:50,244
- Let us take some shots.
- I love shots.

630
00:52:50,245 --> 00:52:51,644
I don't want one.

631
00:52:53,444 --> 00:52:56,762
- Seriously?
- Can you make me something else?

632
00:52:58,962 --> 00:52:59,962
Whatever.

633
00:53:02,062 --> 00:53:04,658
- Are you not drinking, sweety?
- I can't.

634
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:07,858
- You can't?
- Yeah.

635
00:53:07,859 --> 00:53:09,958
Why not?

636
00:53:09,959 --> 00:53:14,109
Ah... football... I get captain the team.

637
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:18,185

- ...trashed!

639
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:48,107
This thing is weedingly out.

640
00:53:48,108 --> 00:53:50,757
- What is it?
- It's called the bass.

641
00:53:54,157 --> 00:53:56,256
Oh, my God, it's so tripper.

642
00:53:57,056 --> 00:54:00,307
- Ok, who's choice is it?
- Yours.

643
00:54:01,008 --> 00:54:02,008
Mine?

644
00:54:02,009 --> 00:54:04,981
Hmm... Trish just got touch Gunnar's dick, remember?

645
00:54:07,181 --> 00:54:09,646
Oh, is really big.

646
00:54:11,646 --> 00:54:13,144
Now it's your turn.

647
00:54:14,044 --> 00:54:16,188
- Gunnar?
- Yeah.

648
00:54:16,189 --> 00:54:19,754
- Say 'dare'.
- Ah... dare.

651
00:54:29,827 --> 00:54:33,247

653
00:54:38,289 --> 00:54:41,687
I dare me to just... freaking do it already.

654
00:54:43,187 --> 00:54:44,387
Do what?

655
00:54:51,184 --> 00:54:56,551
- What is... what is going on?
- Oh... I have to go.

656
00:54:56,552 --> 00:54:59,689
- I don't get it.
- It's not you, Trish, I promise.

657
00:55:06,086 --> 00:55:07,685
Russell, wait.

658
00:55:09,685 --> 00:55:12,292
Do not worry about Trish. You did nothing wrong.

659
00:55:12,293 --> 00:55:14,714
- Really?
- Oh, for sure. Yeah.

660
00:55:14,715 --> 00:55:17,200
Ok, good, 'cause I... I don't want to hurt her, you know?

661
00:55:17,201 --> 00:55:21,698
No. You don't. I know. And you should not have
doing it if you don't want to do, you know?

662
00:55:21,699 --> 00:55:22,699
Alright.

663
00:55:24,998 --> 00:55:28,484
No... I'm the one that's nervous.

664
00:55:28,485 --> 00:55:33,081
- What do you mean?
- I really-really... I really like you, Russell...

665
00:55:33,082 --> 00:55:38,379
...and mean... I only gone with
Gunnar just so that we can chall...

666
00:55:42,478 --> 00:55:44,077
This is so messed up.

667
00:55:50,275 --> 00:55:53,060
- Gunnar, we're going.
- Get off me!

668
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:55,940
- I told you I did not wanna come here.
- Can then leave.

669
00:55:55,941 --> 00:55:59,335
- You're driving!
- You wanna go, then walk home.

670
00:55:59,336 --> 00:56:01,822
- Gunnar, please...
- Walk home!

671
00:56:06,621 --> 00:56:08,020
Fag!

672
00:56:42,203 --> 00:56:44,545
<i>Hey, you around?</i>

673
00:57:23,202 --> 00:57:26,323
- Thanks for coming to keep me.
- Of course.

674
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,317
What's up, kid?

675
00:57:38,117 --> 00:57:39,516
I slug.

676
00:57:39,917 --> 00:57:41,616
What are you talking about?

677
00:57:43,017 --> 00:57:49,555
Everything... I let Trish again... and then I hurt her...

678
00:57:49,556 --> 00:57:56,008
...and... everybody thinks I'm too... reflect or whatever...

679
00:57:57,508 --> 00:58:01,105
I can't believe what I did to Brian Bund...

680
00:58:06,104 --> 00:58:10,360
I'd... I just simply didn't want to risk, I think.

681
00:58:10,961 --> 00:58:17,358
You know, if Jared and Nolan hate me... think... we
can't be friends in public... and... that's killing me...

682
00:58:17,384 --> 00:58:18,982
Listen, hey...

683
00:58:20,562 --> 00:58:22,938
Don't worry about that. That's ok.

684
00:58:24,738 --> 00:58:25,737
It's ok.

685
00:58:26,338 --> 00:58:27,338
No, it's not.

686
00:58:29,737 --> 00:58:36,097
I'm not a joke... or just a joke?..

687
00:58:36,098 --> 00:58:38,197
You're not a joke.

688
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:16,478
<i>Goodkind High's #1 HOMO
Russell Middlebrook</i>

689
01:00:01,156 --> 01:00:03,852
Sit down. I'd love the company.

690
01:00:07,951 --> 01:00:08,951
Thanks.

691
01:00:15,948 --> 01:00:19,167
- You're off team.
- Fine.

692
01:00:19,268 --> 01:00:24,419
Can't believe we didn't see it. We almost
let a girl like you enter our group.

693
01:00:26,019 --> 01:00:28,328
You know you can't technically kick me out of team, right?

694
01:00:28,329 --> 01:00:29,628
We know.

695
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:35,360
But who's gonna stop us? Littlebrook.

696
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:45,364
Hey, it gets better. Believe me,
after a while you just move on.

697
01:00:45,365 --> 01:00:48,163
Why are you being nice to me?

698
01:00:48,164 --> 01:00:51,150
I guess I know what's alike to walk around scared.

699
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:56,080
- I hurt you.
- So what?

700
01:00:56,081 --> 01:01:00,167
Just because people don't understand me
doesn't mean I don't understand them.

701
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:03,920
- So, are we cool?
- Definitely not.

702
01:01:03,921 --> 01:01:07,573
You're gay... I'm kidding.

703
01:01:21,567 --> 01:01:23,366
I couldn't find you in the cafeteria.

704
01:01:26,565 --> 01:01:27,965
Mind if I join?

705
01:01:28,565 --> 01:01:29,565
Come on.

706
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:36,993
- What you're eating?
- It's a fluffend butter.

707
01:01:36,994 --> 01:01:40,735
You've got a little bit of butter on your... lip.

708
01:01:42,635 --> 01:01:43,634
Oh...

709
01:01:45,634 --> 01:01:46,634
Also a peanut butter.

710
01:01:46,935 --> 01:01:52,284
- With marshmallows?
- No, banana.

711
01:01:52,685 --> 01:01:55,093
Banana? Sweet choice.

712
01:01:56,394 --> 01:02:01,440
Look... Gunnar... I'm really sorry about Friday night.

713
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:08,904
Me too. No I meant be so tight all
night, it's just... I can't help it.

714
01:02:08,905 --> 01:02:15,317
I just really... really wanna have
sex in some point before I die.

715
01:02:15,318 --> 01:02:19,591
- You're a virgin?
- Yes... so what?

716
01:02:20,391 --> 01:02:23,379
I love virgins.

717
01:02:33,075 --> 01:02:34,674
Hi, Min.

718
01:02:38,573 --> 01:02:39,972
You're so mad at me?

719
01:02:39,973 --> 01:02:42,779
After Brian opened that toys, you
going to do something like that?

720
01:02:43,379 --> 01:02:46,527
- Oh... Sorry about that, Chief.
- It's ok.

721
01:02:46,528 --> 01:02:49,865
Nah... I don't hit chicks, so bye, ben man.

722
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:58,505
- What are you doing?
- Taking Kimberly's flyers down.

723
01:02:58,506 --> 01:03:00,749
This kind of it shows any good.

724
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:07,366
What if it could? These flyers suck, but...
what if we make some for our own?

725
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:08,566
What are you talking about?

726
01:03:08,567 --> 01:03:11,066
You said it yourself. You're sick of hiding, right?

727
01:03:11,067 --> 01:03:14,252
Look... this is our chance to finally make ourselfs known.

728
01:03:14,253 --> 01:03:15,353
With the Geography Club?

729
01:03:15,953 --> 01:03:21,383
No... Goodkind High's first gay and lesbian support group.

730
01:03:25,981 --> 01:03:29,120
So you can then totally simply throw the information...

731
01:03:29,121 --> 01:03:30,689
You sure? Nothing more?

732
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:41,783
So... You gonna be as our part where's
Brian the only who you're got to ask for?

733
01:03:42,684 --> 01:03:43,993
I'm really sorry.

734
01:03:45,993 --> 01:03:47,791
If Brian's good I'm good.

735
01:03:48,392 --> 01:03:52,666
- I'm good.
- Good.

736
01:03:55,066 --> 01:03:59,985
- What are those?
- Flyers... At least they will be.

737
01:03:59,986 --> 01:04:02,327
We're to make this club a thing, guys.

738
01:04:03,528 --> 01:04:05,327
And if I don't wanna be out?

739
01:04:05,827 --> 01:04:09,191
Well... then you can join again when you're ready.

740
01:04:09,292 --> 01:04:12,337
Sorry, babe... We gotta do this.

741
01:04:32,028 --> 01:04:34,910

- Yeah.

What do you want?

746
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:31,548
- Please, don't be pissed on me.
- I'm not pissed... I'm hurt.

747
01:05:31,549 --> 01:05:36,278
Hey... They wanted you off the team, ok?
There was nothing I could do, alright?

748
01:05:36,579 --> 01:05:38,266
- Whatever...
- Hey, I'm really sorry.

749
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:41,166
- I don't care, Kevin.
- What do you want me to do?

750
01:05:42,566 --> 01:05:47,996
Look, I'm part of a club... It's
more of a support group, I guess.

751
01:05:47,997 --> 01:05:50,771
What do you mean? Like you're an alcohlic now?

752
01:05:50,772 --> 01:05:54,803
- No, I'm not an alcohlic, Kevin...
- It was a joke...

753
01:05:55,503 --> 01:05:56,503
What?

754
01:05:56,504 --> 01:06:00,355
Ah... It's other gay kids... we just...
we share our own stuff...

755
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:03,451
...and it's not official or anything... but ah...

756
01:06:03,452 --> 01:06:07,852
...we just post the flyers announcing our
first meeting tomorrow... after school.

757
01:06:08,553 --> 01:06:09,861
You should come.

758
01:06:11,761 --> 01:06:13,691
You know I can't do that.

759
01:06:13,692 --> 01:06:16,036
You need more help than anyone I know.

760
01:06:16,037 --> 01:06:20,433
- I'll be kicked off the team.
- Oh... is that the most important thing for you right now?

761
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:23,577
- It's my life!
- Hm... it's your life?

762
01:06:23,578 --> 01:06:25,443
Hey, we can still be together!

763
01:06:25,444 --> 01:06:30,106
Ok, listen. We can... we just... you know...
we are... we just can keep that secret...

764
01:06:30,107 --> 01:06:34,308
- Calm down, just calm down!
- I don't get it, Kevin!

765
01:06:34,309 --> 01:06:40,394
I have a Dad that is... that is pressing me to
go to Yale and live the same life that he did.

766
01:06:40,395 --> 01:06:43,821
And that includes having a wife.

767
01:06:43,822 --> 01:06:49,919
You have the only parents in this entire town...
that don't give a shit what you are.

768
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:54,738
It's not about them... This is about me.

769
01:06:57,937 --> 01:07:00,636
I don't want to be gay, Russell.

770
01:07:03,235 --> 01:07:09,086
I just wanna play football... you
know, I just wanna get a scholarship.

771
01:07:09,087 --> 01:07:11,786
I just wanna be normal, Russell.

772
01:07:14,285 --> 01:07:19,392
Hey... but Russell, I really like you... ok?

773
01:07:20,492 --> 01:07:22,746
No... I can't... I can't do this, Kevin.

774
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:26,711
Are we or in a relationship or we're not.

775
01:07:26,712 --> 01:07:28,210
What does have to be that way?

776
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:30,919
Oh... just us.

777
01:07:34,418 --> 01:07:38,971
If you really care about me, then you're
coming at this meeting tomorrow after school.

778
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:44,002
Ok? And if you don't come then... I'm done...

779
01:07:44,003 --> 01:07:49,298
