What are you doing
out in this weather?

I gotta train.

68

00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,448

76
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:44,124
is gonna happen to you
in Coulter Springs?

That my naked,

78

Um, do you.
do you remember my uncle?

The one who
your dad doesn't like?

83
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,241
Yeah.

84
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:02,376
Mm-hm, okay.

85
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:07,247
He said that he could
get me into the private school

86
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:09,283
where all my cousins go.

87
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:10,651
In San Diego?

88
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:14,488
He said
that I could like stay with him

89
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:17,457
and that he'd pay for
my tuition and everything.

90
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:21,595
Holy shit!
Wait, he's not a pervert, is he?

91
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:25,365
No.
At least I don't think.

92
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,134
Well, then,
why else would he want you

93
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,702
to live with him?

94
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,305
Because,
um, this school, like,

95
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:33,540
it has one of the best
track programs in the country.

96
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,475
Something like
half the kids that go there

97
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:38,211
get full athletic scholarships.

98
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,713
Go!

99
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,715
What?

100
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,584
I mean, like,
not that I want you to leave,

101
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:46,420
but like, you have to go.

102
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:49,189
You gotta get out of here,
follow your dreams.

103
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,724
It's not that simple.

104
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,760
It seems
pretty simple to me.

105
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:57,764
What if I go there and I suck?

106
00:09:57,798 --> 00:10:00,534
What if I don't even
make the team?

107
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:03,437
Well, then you laugh
all the way to the beach.

[Wade] Yeah, it's-it's
the alternator, man.

113
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,250
I don't think so.

114
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,619
I should know.

115
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:21,455
I was a rallycross driver
in Norway for three years.

116
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:22,489
Of course you were.

117
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,324
Is there anything
you haven't done?

118
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,195
Not really.

119
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,765
So are you still doing
that radio thing?

120
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,801
Radio?
It's a podcast, man.

121
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:38,405
I just hit 500,000 subscribers
last week.

The messenger who ran from the
Battle of Marathon

129
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:54,354
to Athens to announce
the defeat of the Persians,

130
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:56,223
then collapsed and died.

131
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,958
It's where the marathon
comes from.

132
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,893
- Cool.
- [Nicole] Hmm.

133
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,795
Well, I hope you
weren't running by the border.

Just by Caitlin's house.

137
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:07,567
It's the alternator.

138
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:08,835
[Sam] It's not the alternator.

139
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,937
And you can't tell
by smelling it.

140
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:12,506
Yeah, you can.

141
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,641

[Sam] This is what these people
bring into our country.

More junk.

159
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,285

we hate around here,

160
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,287
it's junk.

[Wade] May I?

169
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:03,017
Well, it appears to be
some kind of totemic figure.

170
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:14,761
Well, if these people
want to improve their lives,

171
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:17,297
I suggest they start by moving
into the 21st century.

00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:14,421
Right now I've got a real
eerie vibe going on tonight.

185
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,656
And it all started
when a friend of mine

186
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,026
[over laptop] <i>found
this creepy wild-looking doll</i>

187
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,494
<i>some migrants left behind
on her property.</i>

188
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:22,796
<i>I sent a picture of it</i>

189
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:23,864
- <i>to my friend Carlos...</i>
- You hear that, girl?

190
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:25,032
- [Wade] <i>who is an afficionado...</i>
- We're famous.

191
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:26,900
[Wade] <i>...of all things
dark and devilish</i>,

192
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:30,071
<i>and he told me
it was a cihuateotl.</i>

193
00:14:30,104 --> 00:14:34,075
<i>If I'm saying that correctly,
it's a type of Aztec demon.</i>

194
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:36,743
<i>Carlos, thanks
for coming on, my man.</i>

195
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:37,944
<i>How are you, amigo?</i>

196
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:39,746
[Carlos] <i>Thanks for having me.</i>

197
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,182
[Wade] <i>Okay,
so you got to tell my audience</i>

198
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,450
<i>what you told me
about these cihuateotls.</i>

199
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,652
[Carlos] <i>Well,
the ancient Aztecs believed</i>

200
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,721
<i>that women who died
in childbirth</i>

201
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:51,424
<i>would sometimes be transformed
into terrifying demons</i>

202
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,027
<i>that would come back to Earth
periodically</i>

203
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,098
<i>to hunt for the thing
that they were denied in life.</i>

204
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:58,099
<i>Babies.</i>

205
00:14:58,132 --> 00:14:59,033
[Wade] <i>You gotta
hand it to those Aztecs</i>

206
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,868
<i>that they knew
how to do creepy, right?</i>

207
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,971
<i>So why do you think
a modern immigrant</i>

208
00:15:05,006 --> 00:15:07,741
<i>would be carrying a doll
depicting an ancient demon</i>

209
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,476
<i>across the border?</i>

210
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,578
[Carlos] <i>Uh, for protection,
most likely</i>.

211
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:14,681
<i>Cihuateotls were believed
to haunt crossroads</i>

212
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:15,916
<i>of border areas specifically...</i>

213
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,484
You kept that thing?

214
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,552
Why not? It's cool.

215
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,023
You didn't check
the mail earlier, did you?

216
00:15:22,056 --> 00:15:24,457
No.

217
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:28,162
Okay. Well, I'm fixing
to make some supper.

218
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,429
You want anything?

219
00:15:31,032 --> 00:15:32,532
Anything.?

220
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,634
I was thinking meatloaf.

221
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:36,137
[Nicole groans]

222
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,837
Or chicken?

223
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:39,873
We had chicken
last night.

224
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,875
[clears throat] I think
we might need to agree on

225
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:44,511
the meaning of the word
"anything."

226
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,613
- [phone vibrating]
- [Nicole chuckles]

227
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:49,616
[phone vibrating]

228
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,786
Uh, it's Caitlin.
You mind?

229
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:55,056
Meatloaf it is.

230
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:56,057
[door closes]

231
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,191
Hi, Uncle Chris.

232
00:15:57,224 --> 00:15:58,792
[Uncle Chris]
<i>Are we whispering?</i>

233
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:02,662
No, no.
Um, uh, what's up?

234
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:04,531
[Uncle Chris] <i>I talked to
the headmaster at Eastlake</i>

235
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:07,268
<i>the other day, and he said if
we're going to do this thing,</i>

236
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:09,502
<i>there's some paperwork
that you'll need to fill out.</i>

237
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:10,804
Oh, okay.

238
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:13,174
[Uncle Chris] <i>Your dad will
need to sign off on it too.</i>

239
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:15,176
[clattering in the distance]

240
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:16,277
Oh.

241
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,744
[Uncle Chris]
<i>Is that a problem?</i>

242
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:20,547
No, no, no, no. Um, not at all.

243
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,716
[Uncle Chris] <i>How is he taking
the whole idea anyway?</i>

244
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,051
Uh, it's fine.

245
00:16:24,085 --> 00:16:26,253
Um, better than you'd expect.

246
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:28,688
[Uncle Chris] <i>Well, I guess
you can teach an old dog</i>

247
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:29,856
<i>new tricks after all.</i>

248
00:16:32,026 --> 00:16:35,595
<i>Anyway, they sent the paperwork
out a few days ago.</i>

249
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:36,830
<i>You should be getting it soon.</i>

250
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,698
<i>We'll need to get
back to them ASAP.</i>

251
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:40,267
[door hinges squeak
in the distance]

252
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:42,069
Um, I... thank you.

253
00:16:42,103 --> 00:16:45,572
Um, I got to go, Uncle Chris.
Uh, bye, sorry.

254
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:46,840
[door opens]

255
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:52,946
Eastlake Academy?

256
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,086
This is where Chris's kids go.

257
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:05,892
[rustling]

258
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:14,634
Dad, we should talk.

259
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,536
- [rustling]
- [Sam sighs]

260
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:19,672
Talk about what?

261
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:28,982
[heavy footsteps]

262
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,825
[both panting]

263
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:45,665
[Rahui speaking in Spanish]

264
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:47,334
[Gabriela speaking in Spanish]

265
00:17:47,368 --> 00:17:48,968
[Rahui breathes heavily]

266
00:17:49,003 --> 00:17:49,936
[speaking in Spanish]

267
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,808
[car approaching]

268
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,181
[Rahui speaking in Spanish]

269
00:18:00,214 --> 00:18:04,218
[footsteps]

270
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,020
[Rahui speaking in Spanish]

271
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:08,988
[Gabriela speaking in Spanish]

272
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,391
[Gabriela grunts]

273
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:12,625
[Rahui speaking in Spanish]

274
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:14,195
[Gabriela speaking in Spanish]

275
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,798
[Rahui speaking in Spanish]

276
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,733
- No. No. No.
- [Rahui] [in Spanish] Stay here.

277
00:18:24,138 --> 00:18:27,174
[soldiers' indistinct
conversations in distance]

278
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:32,745
[Mexican soldiers
speaking in Spanish]

279
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:36,283
[breathes heavily]

280
00:18:36,317 --> 00:18:39,086
[Mexican soldiers
speaking in Spanish]

281
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,766
[gunshot roars]

282
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,117
Ah.

283
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:15,389
[exhales]

284
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,099
[grunts]

285
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:26,833
[door opens]

286
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,304
[door closes]

287
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,704
[exhales]

288
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:34,741
Maybe you should come inside.

289
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:36,910
Why?

290
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:40,880
I like the cold.

291
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:43,350
That way, I can get drunk

292
00:19:43,384 --> 00:19:45,386
and sober up,
all at the same time.

293
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:47,188
[chuckles]

294
00:19:52,226 --> 00:19:56,397
I.I was going to
talk to you about it first.

295
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,965
I guess you think
you're all ready to

296
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,767
strike out on your own, then.

297
00:20:03,003 --> 00:20:04,138
I did-I didn't say that.

298
00:20:06,407 --> 00:20:09,143
But I.
I wouldn't be on my own.

299
00:20:09,176 --> 00:20:10,110
Mm.

300
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:12,346
Right.

301
00:20:14,415 --> 00:20:18,785
Chris never could turn down
an opportunity to show me up,

302
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:19,752
but this?

303
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:23,756
No one is trying
to show anyone up.

304
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,528
[Sam] He tries to steal
my only child away from me

305
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,463
without even talking to me
about it first.

306
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:38,005
I told him
not to say anything to you...

307
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:43,277
so that I could talk to you
about it.

308
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:49,916
So, what's his angle?

309
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:50,850
What's he get out of all this?

310
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,852
Nothing.

311
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:54,255
He just believes in me.

312
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,494
Of course.

313
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:04,864
Guess that's what I've been
doing all these years

314
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:07,101
since your mother left, then?

315
00:21:07,134 --> 00:21:08,102
Not believing in you.

316
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:09,336
That's not what.

317
00:21:12,006 --> 00:21:15,509
He just thinks
that I might be able to compete

318
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:19,013
at a higher level and maybe
even can get a scholarship.

319
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:22,949
Well, excuse me
for not living

320
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:24,884
in a high enough level place.

321
00:21:26,287 --> 00:21:27,421
It wasn't high enough
for your mother.

322
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,490
Why would it be for you?

323
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:31,492
Maybe it wasn't
the place that was the problem.

324
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,501
I'll tell you what.

325
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:47,541
If you think you're such a star
you can go out to California,

326
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:51,278
compete with those big girls,
I'll sign these papers.

327
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:53,347
Dad.

328
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,548
What? No, I will.

329
00:21:56,517 --> 00:21:57,850
I didn't say
I was a star.

330
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:14,568
Forget it.

331
00:22:17,137 --> 00:22:21,041
[door opens then closes]

332
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,345
[sighs]

333
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:46,166
[water pouring]

334
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:52,039
[Nicole humming]

335
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:13,460
[door hinges squeak]

336
00:23:24,104 --> 00:23:27,007
[Lady barks]

337
00:23:28,442 --> 00:23:30,477
Lady, get out!

338
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:33,113
[Lady growls]

339
00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:44,491
- [Nicole continues humming]
- [water pouring continues]

340
00:23:46,427 --> 00:23:49,263
[clattering]

341
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,203
[shower turns off]

342
00:23:56,236 --> 00:23:59,506
[Nicole] Dad? Is that you?

343
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,443
[intense music]

344
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:10,050
[footsteps]

345
00:24:14,688 --> 00:24:18,192
[breathes shakily]

346
00:24:18,225 --> 00:24:19,159
[gasps]

347
00:24:42,516 --> 00:24:45,619
[Lady whines]

348
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:47,554
[Lady barking]

349
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:55,395
Let me see your hands!

350
00:24:58,265 --> 00:24:59,233
Slowly.

351
00:25:01,735 --> 00:25:03,403
[Rahui groans]

352
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:07,341
Who are you?

353
00:25:08,775 --> 00:25:11,478
[car arriving in distance]

354
00:25:11,512 --> 00:25:13,780
[door opens]

355
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,119
- [door opens]
- [Sam] Oh, here we go.

356
00:25:19,152 --> 00:25:20,187
[Wade] There we go.

357
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,356
- [Sam] Uh-huh.
- [Wade] There we go.

358
00:25:22,389 --> 00:25:24,191
Nicole.

359
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,492
Where were you?

360
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:27,828
- [door hinges squeak]
- What are you doing?

361
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:30,531
He called me
and said he needed to talk.

362
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:34,635
While you were out talking,
someone broke into our house.

363
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:37,538
Who?

364
00:25:37,571 --> 00:25:38,505
I don't know.

365
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:41,775
Give me that.

366
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:43,110
Come on, Lady.

367
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:44,478
[Sam] Give me that.

368
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:45,612
You-you really think
you should be

369
00:25:45,646 --> 00:25:47,548
holding a loaded gun
in your condition?

370
00:25:47,581 --> 00:25:48,582
She's right.

371
00:25:48,615 --> 00:25:50,651
You just stay here.

372
00:25:50,684 --> 00:25:52,419
Keep the doors
and windows locked.

373
00:25:54,521 --> 00:25:55,422
Come on, girl.

374
00:25:58,592 --> 00:26:00,193
I got him.

375
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:01,395
[Sam] Wade, come on!

376
00:26:01,428 --> 00:26:02,763
[Wade] I'm coming.

377
00:26:02,796 --> 00:26:05,832
[inhales and exhales deeply]

378
00:26:05,866 --> 00:26:07,100
[door closes]

379
00:26:08,435 --> 00:26:09,836
[Wade] Looks like
it's trampled down around here.

380
00:26:13,707 --> 00:26:14,641
What's that there?

381
00:26:14,675 --> 00:26:15,642
Hey.

382
00:26:17,144 --> 00:26:19,246
This has got to be
where they're coming through.

383
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,848
[grunts]

384
00:26:21,882 --> 00:26:23,684
He's got to be long gone by now.

385
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:27,387
[Sam] Oh shit!
Well...

386
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:28,488
[fence clanking]

387
00:26:28,522 --> 00:26:31,258
[grunts]

388
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:32,192
...are you coming?

389
00:26:34,828 --> 00:26:36,396
Lady, hey!

390
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,464
Lady!

391
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:51,378
[Lady whines]

392
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:57,184
[groans] No. Get away.

393
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:06,259
[Agent Reyes] Disemboweled.

394
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:07,327
You're sure about that?

395
00:27:07,361 --> 00:27:09,696
No.

396
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:10,697
I made it up.

397
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:12,733
I can take you to him.

398
00:27:14,668 --> 00:27:16,470
Unfortunately, our
jurisdiction ends at the border.

399
00:27:16,503 --> 00:27:19,306
There are two men
lying dead out there!

400
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:20,641
Out of interest,

401
00:27:20,674 --> 00:27:22,809
what exactly were you doing
on the Mexican side?

402
00:27:22,843 --> 00:27:25,579
I was chasing my dog.

403
00:27:25,612 --> 00:27:26,780
What's going on?

404
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:27,748
[Agent Reyes] Who are you?

405
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:29,182
I'm his daughter.

406
00:27:29,216 --> 00:27:30,951
And did you see these bodies?

407
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:32,819
What. what bodies?

408
00:27:32,853 --> 00:27:34,521
Uh, someone
broke into the house

409
00:27:34,554 --> 00:27:35,622
when she was here alone.

410
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:38,892
That's why we went to the border
in the first place.

411
00:27:38,925 --> 00:27:40,827
Do you know who it was?

412
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:42,963
Another border jumper.

413
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:45,265
What did he look like?

414
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:49,936
He was, um, Hispanic,
uh, late teens, early 20s.

415
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,638
Did he threaten you in any way?

416
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:53,206
No.

417
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,777
Actually, he seemed
more scared than anything.

418
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:00,213
All right, well, we'll notify
the Spanish authorities

419
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:01,115
about the bodies you found,

420
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:03,417
and keep an eye out
for your intruder.

421
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,886
In the meantime, you might
want to be a little careful.

422
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,488
Maybe not wander too far
from the house for now.

423
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:09,856
For now?

424
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:10,757
When the hell is this
going to end?

425
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:13,360
Hey, hey.
We're all friends here, man.

426
00:28:13,393 --> 00:28:14,528
These guys are just
doing their job, all right?

427
00:28:14,561 --> 00:28:17,731
Well, I'm not gonna become
a prisoner in my own home,

428
00:28:17,764 --> 00:28:19,800
in the home where I was born,
where my brother is buried.

429
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,835
We understand your
frustration, Mister Sorenson.

430
00:28:23,303 --> 00:28:25,305
The truth is,
we had a similar incident

431
00:28:25,338 --> 00:28:27,607
reported a couple days ago.

432
00:28:27,641 --> 00:28:30,477
Body was found
on our side of the fence.

433
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,246
It had been eviscerated.

434
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,449
So we're just asking you
to be a little extra careful.

435
00:28:35,482 --> 00:28:37,217
Stay away from the border
for the time being.

436
00:28:38,852 --> 00:28:42,556
[sniffling]

437
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:43,523
All right.

438
00:28:49,996 --> 00:28:52,833
You fellas better
up your game and quick,

439
00:28:52,866 --> 00:28:55,702
because I'm sick and tired
of my property

440
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:58,839
being used as Grand Central
for illegals.

441
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:07,981
Do your damn job!

442
00:29:08,015 --> 00:29:10,917
[dramatic music]

443
00:29:13,087 --> 00:29:14,521
Sorry about that.

444
00:29:17,724 --> 00:29:18,625
[door closes]

445
00:29:37,577 --> 00:29:38,912
[grunts]

446
00:29:45,052 --> 00:29:47,521
- [Sam clears throat]
- [Nicole gasps]

447
00:29:47,554 --> 00:29:49,456
What're you doing?

448
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:51,758
I'm heading up to Midland.

449
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:54,961
Midland? That's like four hours
from here.

450
00:29:54,995 --> 00:29:57,697
Wade's got a buddy who owns
a electronic shop up there.

451
00:29:57,731 --> 00:29:59,933
He's going to hook me up
some CCTV cameras.

452
00:30:02,036 --> 00:30:04,038
[Nicole] I thought
the truck was broken.

453
00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:06,807
I fixed it.
It was the alternator.

454
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,508
[Nicole exhales]

455
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:10,544
While I'm out,
I want you to stay inside.

456
00:30:10,577 --> 00:30:13,446
Keep the doors
and windows locked.

457
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,949
What am I supposed to do
inside all day?

458
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:18,752
I don't know.
Watch TV.

459
00:30:18,785 --> 00:30:20,453
Knit something.

460
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,556
- Doors and windows locked.
- [Nicole groans]

461
00:30:24,591 --> 00:30:25,792
[exhales deeply]

462
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:26,726
[door closes]

463
00:30:27,894 --> 00:30:29,996
- [birds chirping]
- [cows mooing]

464
00:30:30,031 --> 00:30:31,798
[Caitlin] Disemboweled?

465
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:34,601
You mean like-like
[imitates pooping of pants]

466
00:30:34,634 --> 00:30:38,005
No. Like
[imitates cutting of stomach]

467
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,040
Oh.

468
00:30:40,473 --> 00:30:41,775
Yikes.

469
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:43,677
Yeah.

470
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,146
My dad found them.

471
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:46,947
Creepy.

472
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,683
You know, maybe we should
all move to San Diego.

473
00:30:49,716 --> 00:30:53,420
[Nicole] I'm pretty sure they
have murderers in San Diego too.

474
00:30:53,453 --> 00:30:55,089
I don't think so.

475
00:30:55,122 --> 00:30:59,526
Speaking of which,
what did he say?

476
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:01,728
He said I could go
if I wanted to.

477
00:31:01,761 --> 00:31:02,863
[Caitlin] Well, that's great.

478
00:31:02,896 --> 00:31:04,965
Isn't it?

479
00:31:04,998 --> 00:31:07,101
I don't think
I even want to go.

480
00:31:07,134 --> 00:31:09,936
I mean, it's one semester;
it doesn't even matter.

481
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,805
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

482
00:31:11,838 --> 00:31:13,807
Mm. Pack.

483
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,875
Stop.

484
00:31:14,908 --> 00:31:16,110
No, come on.

485
00:31:16,143 --> 00:31:19,813
You are a freaking
genius runner.

486
00:31:19,846 --> 00:31:23,416
And you're gonna go to San Diego
and prove it.

487
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:28,022
I might be good
in Coulter Springs but.

488
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:29,990
it's not really fair to my dad.

489
00:31:30,024 --> 00:31:31,958
I knew it.
I knew he guilted you.

490
00:31:31,992 --> 00:31:34,694
No, he didn't.

491
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:37,931
Okay, he did,
but he has a point.

492
00:31:37,964 --> 00:31:40,433
My dad stuck with me
all those years

493
00:31:40,467 --> 00:31:43,637
when my mom bailed out on us.

494
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:47,074
It's not really fair
for me to bail on him now.

495
00:31:47,108 --> 00:31:48,642
[Lady scratching]

496
00:31:48,675 --> 00:31:50,011
[Lady whines]

[door opens]

[Lady barking]

499
00:31:59,053 --> 00:32:00,054
[Nicole] Lady?

500
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:00,954
[Lady continues barking]

501
00:32:11,065 --> 00:32:13,067
[Lady continues barking]

[storage door opening]

503
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:24,544
Let's go.

504
00:32:24,577 --> 00:32:26,646
[Lady whines]

505
00:32:40,061 --> 00:32:42,096
It's all right.
It's all right.

506
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:43,897
You. you know this guy?

507
00:32:45,532 --> 00:32:46,566
[Nicole] He broke
into our house last night

508
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:48,069
while my dad was at the bar.

509
00:32:50,171 --> 00:32:51,905
[Caitlin] Are you insane?

510
00:32:51,938 --> 00:32:53,673
He-he could be the guy
who killed those soldiers.

511
00:32:53,707 --> 00:32:54,674
He could kill us.

512
00:32:56,943 --> 00:32:58,912
It's all right.
It's all right.

513
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,655
Okay, that's it.
I'm calling my dad.

514
00:33:08,688 --> 00:33:09,823
No, don't.

515
00:33:09,856 --> 00:33:11,225
Okay, well,
then you call your dad.

516
00:33:11,258 --> 00:33:13,260
Definitely not.

517
00:33:13,294 --> 00:33:15,129
I can't get
in trouble for this.

518
00:33:17,264 --> 00:33:18,631
Don't tell anyone.

519
00:33:22,303 --> 00:33:23,237
Caitlin!

520
00:33:32,113 --> 00:33:34,881
[tools clattering]

521
00:33:36,783 --> 00:33:37,717
Here, it's okay.

522
00:33:45,326 --> 00:33:46,227
[handcuffs clank]

00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:51,831
[Rahui groans]

524
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:54,068
My father found
two Mexican soldiers

525
00:33:54,101 --> 00:33:55,102
murdered last night.

526
00:33:56,903 --> 00:33:59,273
I didn't kill them.

527
00:33:59,306 --> 00:34:00,207
I believe you.

528
00:34:05,112 --> 00:34:06,047
[Rahui winces in pain]

529
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,349
Sorry.

530
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:09,716
Well, that should
be good for now,

531
00:34:09,749 --> 00:34:12,019
but you should really go
to a hospital.

532
00:34:12,053 --> 00:34:13,620
No. No hospital.

533
00:34:13,653 --> 00:34:16,123
I-I know that you don't
want to get in trouble, but...

534
00:34:16,157 --> 00:34:18,658
My sister
is still out there.

535
00:34:18,691 --> 00:34:19,993
Across the border?

536
00:34:21,195 --> 00:34:22,896
Is-is she hurt?

537
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:25,332
No. No hurt.
She's.

538
00:34:25,366 --> 00:34:27,268
[sighs]

539
00:34:27,301 --> 00:34:28,335
.embarazada.

540
00:34:31,105 --> 00:34:33,074
She has a baby in her belly.

541
00:34:33,107 --> 00:34:34,108
She's pregnant?

542
00:34:34,141 --> 00:34:35,309
<i>Si. Si.</i> Pregnant.

543
00:34:35,342 --> 00:34:36,243
What were you doing

544
00:34:36,277 --> 00:34:37,977
bringing a pregnant girl
across the border?

545
00:34:41,215 --> 00:34:45,019
Never mind.
Um, who did this to you?

546
00:34:47,854 --> 00:34:50,391
[inhales and exhales deeply]

547
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:52,059
You won't believe me
if I tell you.

548
00:34:58,265 --> 00:35:00,234
[inhales and exhales deeply]

549
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:02,069
There is a myth in my country

550
00:35:02,103 --> 00:35:06,973
about women who come back
from the death to steal babies.

551
00:35:09,376 --> 00:35:11,345
Shut up!

552
00:35:11,378 --> 00:35:14,914
[heavy footsteps]

553
00:35:21,155 --> 00:35:22,256
Where'd you get this?

554
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:23,890
We found it in our shed.

555
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:27,794
[inhales and exhales]

556
00:35:27,827 --> 00:35:30,364
This is Coaxoch,
Serpent Flower.

557
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:40,141
She was a beautiful woman
who was sacrificed

558
00:35:40,174 --> 00:35:43,277
with her unborn baby
by the Aztec king Montezuma.

559
00:35:48,082 --> 00:35:51,784
There's a legend
among people near here

560
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:54,188
that she comes back
as a cihuateotl

561
00:35:54,221 --> 00:35:55,623
to haunt the border.

562
00:36:07,067 --> 00:36:08,335
This is all
I could find.

563
00:36:10,803 --> 00:36:13,907
All my exes
live in Texas?

564
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,075
[Nicole chuckles]

565
00:36:22,749 --> 00:36:24,018
[Rahui grunts]

566
00:36:31,025 --> 00:36:34,161
Uh, I've. I was just
noticing your necklace.

567
00:36:37,431 --> 00:36:41,168
My mother gave it to me
before we came up north.

568
00:36:41,202 --> 00:36:45,439
It's Saint Christopher.
Patron saint of travelers.

569
00:36:45,472 --> 00:36:46,839
What's he carrying?

570
00:36:49,009 --> 00:36:49,943
A child.

571
00:37:02,922 --> 00:37:05,092
Fits perfectly.

572
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:06,360
You're a local now.

573
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:08,895
[both chuckle]

574
00:37:08,928 --> 00:37:10,830
What are those?

575
00:37:10,863 --> 00:37:14,401
Oh, nothing.
That's just, um, I, I run track.

576
00:37:14,435 --> 00:37:15,868
You must be
very good at it.

577
00:37:15,902 --> 00:37:18,372
[chuckles] I guess.

578
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:21,874
I mean, there's not really
much competition out here.

579
00:37:23,876 --> 00:37:26,080
My mother's people
run too.

580
00:37:26,113 --> 00:37:27,047
They do?

581
00:37:28,249 --> 00:37:30,417
It started
as a way of sending messages

582
00:37:30,451 --> 00:37:32,952
between the villages.

583
00:37:32,986 --> 00:37:34,988
Now it's just a tradition.

584
00:37:35,022 --> 00:37:37,291
So cool.

585
00:37:37,324 --> 00:37:39,460
I guess we have
something in common.

586
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,431
[car pulling up]

587
00:37:44,465 --> 00:37:46,033
Oh, shit.
It's my dad.

588
00:37:46,066 --> 00:37:47,101
Stay here and be quiet.

Dad!
Here, here let me help you.

592
00:37:59,413 --> 00:38:00,347
Why don't you take those?

593
00:38:00,381 --> 00:38:01,415
Yeah. Of course.

594
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:02,882
Take those.
These are for me.

595
00:38:02,915 --> 00:38:03,950
[Sam and Nicole laugh]

[Lady barking]

597
00:38:07,421 --> 00:38:09,889
Lady, it's just me.

598
00:38:09,922 --> 00:38:10,890
You got the cameras.

599
00:38:10,923 --> 00:38:12,226
I got them.

600
00:38:12,259 --> 00:38:13,394
Next time anyone
gets near this place,

601
00:38:13,427 --> 00:38:14,961
we'll have a record of it.

602
00:38:14,994 --> 00:38:19,033
[Lady whining]

603
00:38:19,066 --> 00:38:20,367
- That's great.
- [Lady barking]

604
00:38:20,401 --> 00:38:21,502
[Sam] What's wrong with her?

605
00:38:21,535 --> 00:38:23,137
Nothing.

606
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,471
What did you do all day?

607
00:38:24,505 --> 00:38:25,838
[Nicole] Knitted a sweater.

608
00:38:27,408 --> 00:38:28,908
Caitlin came over.

609
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,545
You want some jerky?
It's your favorite.

610
00:38:31,578 --> 00:38:34,947
Um, no, I'm fine.
I'm not feeling that well.

611
00:38:34,981 --> 00:38:37,251
I think I'm actually
gonna go to bed soon.

612
00:38:37,284 --> 00:38:38,985
What about apology pizza?

613
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:41,121
[Lady barks]

614
00:38:41,155 --> 00:38:43,090
Lady.
What is with that dog?

615
00:38:43,123 --> 00:38:44,058
Dad!

616
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:47,194
[Sam] What's going on in here?

617
00:38:47,227 --> 00:38:48,162
Nothing.

618
00:38:49,396 --> 00:38:51,332
Dad! That is my room.
It's a boundary.

619
00:38:51,365 --> 00:38:52,199
We talked about this.

620
00:38:52,232 --> 00:38:54,867
Yeah.
Well, we don't get to have those

621
00:38:54,901 --> 00:38:57,204
when people get killed
near our house.

622
00:38:57,237 --> 00:39:01,908
[sighs] Nicole, I told you to
keep these windows shut.

623
00:39:04,545 --> 00:39:06,246
Are you all right?

624
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,216
I said I'm not feeling well.

625
00:39:09,249 --> 00:39:11,984
Maybe
you should eat something.

626
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:15,422
Dad, I'm not feeling well.

627
00:39:17,957 --> 00:39:23,163
Oh. All right.

628
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:25,632
Sorry.

You're bleeding again.

639
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,182
We need to get out of here.

640
00:41:22,216 --> 00:41:24,418
- I need to find Gabriela.
- [Nicole] No.

641
00:41:24,451 --> 00:41:25,252
You're not gonna
find anyone like this.

642

[breathes heavily]

644
00:41:29,723 --> 00:41:31,391
I know someone
who can help us

645
00:41:31,425 --> 00:41:33,660
and then we can find her, okay?

646
00:41:33,694 --> 00:41:37,631
We can take my dad's truck.
Come on. It's gonna be okay.

That's what
the legend says.

00:48:01,148 --> 00:48:03,717
but that this might
almost be over.

724
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:07,021
How would one
go about getting rid of

725
00:48:07,054 --> 00:48:09,623
one of these things
before the five days is up,

726
00:48:09,656 --> 00:48:11,458
if you had to?

727
00:48:12,525 --> 00:48:13,460
You don't.

728
00:48:15,196 --> 00:48:18,165
You can't kill something
that's already dead.

729
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:24,071
You just got to run.hide. try to
outlast the suckers.

[footsteps]

731
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:01,474
It's here. Right up.
Let's go.

734
00:49:06,546 --> 00:49:07,214
[Nicole] Are you okay?

735
00:49:10,117 --> 00:49:13,486
[Rahui groans]

736
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,855
Just stay here.
I'll go get her.

[cihuateotl breathes heavily]

745
00:50:09,343 --> 00:50:10,577
I'm here to help you.

746
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:13,680
I'm with Rahui.

747
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:24,025

[Nicole gasps]

751
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,207
What is it?

752
00:50:40,241 --> 00:50:42,776
[Nicole] Run! Just run!

753
00:50:42,809 --> 00:50:44,078
Nicole!
What happened?

754
00:50:44,111 --> 00:50:47,014
[intense music continues]

755

[Rahui breathing hard]

756
00:51:04,031 --> 00:51:07,667
- [Nicole] Rahui, we need to go.
- [Rahui groans]

757
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:08,635
I can't.

[Nicole sighs deeply]

799
00:58:01,748 --> 00:58:03,417
An Aztec demon?

800
00:58:04,551 --> 00:58:06,253
She's looking
for babies.

801
00:58:08,555 --> 00:58:10,557
[sarcastic chuckle]
Are you on something?

802
00:58:10,591 --> 00:58:11,725
- Who are these.?
- Listen to me!

803
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:21,702
She's the one who's cutting
the stomachs.

804
00:58:25,305 --> 00:58:26,273
No, that's the cartels...

805
00:58:26,306 --> 00:58:28,108
No, Dad. No.
I saw it.

806
00:58:43,724 --> 00:58:44,691
Dad.

807
00:58:48,595 --> 00:58:53,700
I never told you how
your Uncle Nicholas died, did I?

808
00:58:55,402 --> 00:58:56,637
[Nicole] No.

809
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,208
He was.

810
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:05,412
<i>murdered.</i>

811
00:59:07,714 --> 00:59:09,483
He-he was cut.

812
00:59:15,188 --> 00:59:16,223
In the stomach?

813
00:59:19,326 --> 00:59:24,331
We were down playing
by the border and I left,

814
00:59:24,364 --> 00:59:28,068
and he never came home.

815
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:32,406
I was the one who found him.

816
00:59:32,439 --> 00:59:37,210
Almost rolled over him
on my bike, and he had been.

817
00:59:42,149 --> 00:59:43,617
he'd been gutted like an animal.

818
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,722
I still can't get
that image out of my head.

819
00:59:57,598 --> 00:59:59,533
[phone ringing]

820
01:00:02,402 --> 01:00:03,570
[Wade exhales deeply]

821
01:00:03,604 --> 01:00:05,372
Come on.
Pick up the call.

822
01:00:05,405 --> 01:00:08,542
[phone ringing continues]

823
01:00:10,611 --> 01:00:11,511
This is great.

824
01:00:14,648 --> 01:00:15,849

825
01:00:17,351 --> 01:00:18,852

[eerie sound]

830
01:01:36,697 --> 01:01:38,865
[Sam] You think
that thing followed you?

831
01:01:38,899 --> 01:01:41,568
[sighs deeply]
I don't know.

832
01:01:42,936 --> 01:01:46,940
I pushed it down
a mineshaft or something.

833
01:01:46,973 --> 01:01:47,974
It seemed pretty deep.

834
01:01:48,009 --> 01:01:49,876
[Sam] [chuckles] A mineshaft?

835
01:01:51,878 --> 01:01:53,447
They are plenty deep.

836
01:01:54,548 --> 01:01:56,450
Halfway to hell.

837
01:01:56,483 --> 01:01:57,718
Least, that was my experience.

838
01:01:59,986 --> 01:02:01,488
You-you were a miner?

839
01:02:01,521 --> 01:02:04,291
Nah. [scoffs] A grunt.

840
01:02:06,326 --> 01:02:09,496
But I'll tell you what,
working in that mine

841
01:02:09,529 --> 01:02:10,731
bought you
a hell of a lot more diapers

842
01:02:10,764 --> 01:02:14,434
than my rodeo career
ever would have.

843
01:02:17,637 --> 01:02:18,905
I heard
you were pretty good.

844
01:02:22,642 --> 01:02:23,710
Where'd you hear that?

845
01:02:27,414 --> 01:02:28,415
Mom.

846
01:02:36,923 --> 01:02:38,725
[sniffles] Oh.

847
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:42,529
Look.

848
01:02:42,562 --> 01:02:44,898
[sniffles] Nicole.

849
01:02:47,768 --> 01:02:50,570
I've never been
an easy guy to talk to,

850
01:02:50,604 --> 01:02:51,605
to live with.

851
01:02:54,741 --> 01:02:57,911
One thing I always have been
is, uh, a man of my word.

852
01:03:00,847 --> 01:03:02,682
so.

853
01:03:07,521 --> 01:03:08,588
Like I said I would.

854
01:03:16,963 --> 01:03:17,931
[sobs]

855
01:03:17,964 --> 01:03:18,899
[Nicole] Thanks.

856
01:03:23,537 --> 01:03:24,671
I want you to be happy.

857
01:03:28,909 --> 01:03:30,777
[banging on door]

[door opens]

859
01:03:34,815 --> 01:03:35,882
Oh, hi.

860
01:03:35,916 --> 01:03:37,951
Caitlin.
What are you doing here?

861
01:03:37,984 --> 01:03:39,953
Sorry, you weren't
answering your phone.

862
01:03:39,986 --> 01:03:41,788
Am I interrupting?

863
01:03:41,822 --> 01:03:44,724
No. Oh, uh, I'll, I'll wait
in the other room.

864
01:03:44,758 --> 01:03:47,394
It's.it's nice
to see you, Caitlin.

865
01:03:47,427 --> 01:03:50,530
[footsteps]

866
01:03:50,564 --> 01:03:51,565
Is this a bad time?

867
01:03:51,598 --> 01:03:54,568
No. Um, you just scared us.

868
01:03:54,601 --> 01:03:55,602
So what's up?

869
01:03:55,635 --> 01:03:58,805
Okay, I had an epiphany.

870
01:03:58,839 --> 01:04:01,474
Okay.

871
01:04:01,508 --> 01:04:05,412
What if we go
to San Diego together?

872
01:04:05,445 --> 01:04:06,913
W-what?

873
01:04:06,947 --> 01:04:08,849
I mean,
I have some money saved up.

874
01:04:08,882 --> 01:04:12,786
And what do I love more
than anything in the world?

875
01:04:12,819 --> 01:04:14,421
TV and movies.

876
01:04:14,454 --> 01:04:17,624
And where do they make
TV and movies?

877
01:04:17,657 --> 01:04:19,526
Not in Coulter Springs.

878
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:24,865
So I figure you and I
could go to California

879
01:04:24,898 --> 01:04:26,133
and pursue our dreams together.

880
01:04:26,167 --> 01:04:27,068
What do you think?

881
01:04:29,469 --> 01:04:30,604
What about school?

882
01:04:30,637 --> 01:04:31,538
What about it?

883
01:04:31,571 --> 01:04:32,939
It's not like
I'm learning anything, so.

884
01:04:34,774 --> 01:04:36,409
Can we talk
about it later?

885
01:04:36,443 --> 01:04:39,679
Oh, okay.
But I'm not leaving here

886
01:04:39,713 --> 01:04:42,049
until you tell me
that there is, like,

887
01:04:42,083 --> 01:04:43,650
a chance you'll say yes.

888
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:47,420
Okay.

889
01:04:47,454 --> 01:04:48,488
Okay what?

890
01:04:48,521 --> 01:04:49,456
There's a chance
I'll say yes.

891
01:04:49,489 --> 01:04:50,991
Okay, I knew you would.

892
01:04:51,025 --> 01:04:53,894
Okay, I have to go to my aunt's
wedding in Lubbock tomorrow,

893
01:04:53,927 --> 01:04:55,495
but I will call you
from the road

894
01:04:55,528 --> 01:04:56,863
because it's
going to be boring.

895
01:04:56,897 --> 01:04:57,931
Um, Caitlin?

896
01:04:57,964 --> 01:04:58,899
What?

897
01:05:01,635 --> 01:05:04,171
Maybe you should just
lock all your doors and windows

898
01:05:04,205 --> 01:05:05,939
and stay inside tonight.

899
01:05:05,972 --> 01:05:09,143
[laughs] Okay, Grandma.

900
01:05:09,176 --> 01:05:11,778
Oh, oh, cuz of the...
[imitates cutting of stomach]

901
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:15,582
Oh, how would I ever survive

902
01:05:15,615 --> 01:05:19,186
in this world without you,
Nikki Sorenson?

903
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:20,654
You're useless.

904
01:05:20,687 --> 01:05:22,622
I know. Bye.

905
01:05:22,656 --> 01:05:24,158
Bye.

906
01:05:24,191 --> 01:05:25,492
