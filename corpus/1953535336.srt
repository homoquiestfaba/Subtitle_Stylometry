1
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,789
Please!
Help me! Help me!

2
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,492
Please!

3
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:48,768
Thanks.
Yeah.

4
00:02:49,768 --> 00:02:51,835
So what's left?

5
00:02:51,836 --> 00:02:53,670
Well, we've got
all the camping gear.

6
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:55,339
You've got your
camera stuff, right?

7
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,474
Yeah, it's in the truck.

8
00:02:56,475 --> 00:02:58,443
Well, then looks like all
we got left are the girls.

9
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,445
Are they ready?

10
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,450
Yeah, I just called.
Told them we're on our way.

11
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,586
Sounds good.
Hey, Will.

12
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:09,287
Yeah?

13
00:03:09,288 --> 00:03:10,589
I really appreciate you coming
out on this trip with us.

14
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,825
Oh, it's no problem, man.

15
00:03:13,825 --> 00:03:15,595
So we gonna have fun, or what?

16
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:17,762
I guess.

17
00:03:17,763 --> 00:03:20,565
Come on, man,
are we gonna have fun?

18
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:22,333
You know it.
Well, let's hit it!

19
00:04:18,423 --> 00:04:20,495
Um... Is Brooke here?

20
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:25,533
I'm sorry.
You must be Kyle.

21
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:31,903
We couldn't have chosen a more rainy day.
This weather, huh?

22
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,740
Brooke!
If I had nickel for every time...

23
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,610
Right.

24
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,511
Looks like you two hit it off.

25
00:04:40,512 --> 00:04:42,112
Yeah.

26
00:04:42,113 --> 00:04:44,915
He almost caught me sneaking her
out of the house in high school.

27
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,389
Apparently he hasn't
forgotten about it.

28
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:51,759
Hey, whoa!

29
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,525
Hey, Jenna.
Hey, James.

30
00:04:55,526 --> 00:04:57,662
Will, you know Jenna, right?
Yeah. Of course.

31
00:04:57,663 --> 00:04:59,397
Hi.

32
00:04:59,398 --> 00:05:01,370
All packed up?
Yeah, yeah, just one second.

33
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,737
That was a pretty
enthusiastic greeting.

34
00:05:06,738 --> 00:05:08,506
What're you talking about?

35
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:09,709
Whoa!

36
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:13,579
You two still have
something going on?

37
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,746
Maybe. Why?

38
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,648
Don't bullshit me.
I'm not. I'm not bullshitting you.

39
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,817
You're doing that face
you do when you lie.

40
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:21,687
Okay. All right.
It's a small thing.

41
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,862
Let's not make it into
a big thing, okay?

42
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,496
What the hell is he doing?

43
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,730
I'm so sorry.

44
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:35,870
You can't be serious.
He fucking hates me.

45
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,605
You... You didn't tell
about us, did you?

46
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,439
You serious?
He'd freak out.

47
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,441
We've got it under control.

48
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:45,443
Daddy didn't know
that Will was going.

49
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:47,646
He's not too fond of you, Will.

50
00:05:48,646 --> 00:05:49,848
Great.

51
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:52,920
Chill. Just chill.

52
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,658
It's okay.

53
00:06:00,658 --> 00:06:01,761
Hey.

54
00:06:02,761 --> 00:06:03,598
Heard you're coming along?

55
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:08,832
Yeah.

56
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:09,536
All right.

57
00:06:11,536 --> 00:06:12,523
It's good to have you, man.

58
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:35,525
Will, what brings you along?

59
00:06:35,526 --> 00:06:37,696
Well, James asked me to come
along and take some photos

60
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,732
while you guys
conduct your interview.

61
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:42,700
Interview?
What interview?

62
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:43,800
That's what
we're doing actually.

63
00:06:43,801 --> 00:06:45,771
We're going to Madison County
to interview an author.

64
00:06:46,771 --> 00:06:48,773
Why?

65
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:50,841
Well, I've been writing letters
back and forth with this guy

66
00:06:50,842 --> 00:06:52,043
for a few weeks now.

67
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,912
He invited us out to interview
him for my thesis paper.

68
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:56,913
I thought we'd make
a trip out of it.

69
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:59,616
There's a lot of controversy
around the book actually.

70
00:06:59,617 --> 00:07:02,889
It's about a guy
named Damien Ewell.

71
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:06,556
According to the author,
David Randall,

72
00:07:06,557 --> 00:07:10,628
he killed around 33 people over the
course of a couple of decades.

73
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:12,563
No one in the town told anyone.

74
00:07:12,564 --> 00:07:13,998
Is this true?

75
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:15,967
David Randall claims it is.

76
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,736
But no one believes him, right?

77
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:20,072
I'm not sure. I mean,
that's part of the interview.

78
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,840
I want to get the people's point
of view on the whole situation.

79
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:25,275
So about how far away is this?

80
00:07:25,276 --> 00:07:27,645
It's a good half day drive.

81
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:28,980
The only way to get to it
is through the hills,

82
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,816
so lots of twists, and turns.

83
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:33,021
Hope nobody
gets motion sickness.

84
00:07:50,935 --> 00:07:52,736
I guess this is a good chance
to get out and stretch

85
00:07:52,737 --> 00:07:53,939
if anyone needs to.

86
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,705
Anybody need anything to drink?

87
00:07:55,706 --> 00:07:56,908
I'll take a water.

88
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,743
Water. Anybody else?

89
00:07:58,744 --> 00:07:59,879
All good.

90
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,922
How about you, Kyle? You
want a hotdog or something?

91
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,766
Thank you.

92
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,650
Who's that?

93
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,719
You need a jump?

94
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,589
No, sir. We're just waiting on our
friend over here to get his sea legs.

95
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,792
Oh, I see.

96
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,926
Where are you headed?

97
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:50,763
We're actually headed
to Madison County.

98
00:08:51,763 --> 00:08:53,164
What're you doing going there?

99
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,365
Well, we're gonna write
this, like, paper...

100
00:08:55,366 --> 00:08:59,637
We're actually headed that
way to get to the Mulberry.

101
00:08:59,638 --> 00:09:00,740
Gonna do some canoeing.

102
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,674
Oh.

103
00:09:03,674 --> 00:09:04,974
Where are your canoes?

104
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,646
Uh, we're gonna rent 'em
down at the entrance.

105
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:09,749
Smart man.

106
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:11,985
Yes, sir.

107
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,395
All right, y'all take care.

108
00:09:24,395 --> 00:09:27,697
You know, there's a road
that you could take

109
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:29,869
just before the 16.

110
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:32,970
Save you almost 30 minutes.

111
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:34,705
Oh, yeah?

112
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:36,840
Yeah, and it's not
as hilly either.

113
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:39,879
Be good for your
friend over there.

114
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,979
It's called Pettigrew.

115
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,981
All right, I appreciate that.

116
00:09:44,982 --> 00:09:46,716
No problem.

117
00:09:46,717 --> 00:09:48,988
Y'all take care.

118
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:09,105
So, how'd you get
a hold of this guy?

119
00:10:09,106 --> 00:10:12,710
Well, I contacted him from the
address on the back of the book.

120
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:15,211
But it took him a while
to get back to me.

121
00:10:15,212 --> 00:10:17,015
Does he write you often?

122
00:10:18,015 --> 00:10:19,917
Yeah, yeah, kind of.

123
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:22,219
I mean, it usually
takes him a few days

124
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,889
to get back to me
each time though.

125
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:28,893
Why don't you just
e-mail, call?

126
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:31,030
I would, but he doesn't
have a phone or a computer.

127
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,899
God, that's gotta be awful.

128
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,070
Can you imagine the privacy?

129
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:44,207
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

130
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,113
Do you want me to come with you?
No, I'm a big girl.

131
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:49,852
I can go by myself.

132
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:58,791
So, James, are you finally
going to make your move?

133
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,959
What are you talking about?

134
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,062
Oh, my God, don't play dumb.
She's into you.

135
00:11:05,062 --> 00:11:06,066
Really? What'd she say?

136
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:11,067
Hey, I can't break
the code of girl talk.

137
00:11:11,068 --> 00:11:14,305
But I definitely think
she likes you.

138
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,107
Don't act like it's some
kind of surprise, okay?

139
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,076
Yeah.

140
00:11:19,076 --> 00:11:20,880
So, what's the plan
for tomorrow?

141
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,783
Kyle.

142
00:11:25,783 --> 00:11:26,882
No, no, it's fine.

143
00:11:26,883 --> 00:11:27,751
Well, when we get into town,

144
00:11:27,752 --> 00:11:29,319
we're gonna talk
to some of the people

145
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,855
before going out
to David's place.

146
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:31,993
There. Happy?

147
00:11:34,993 --> 00:11:36,860
So. About Jenna.

148
00:11:36,861 --> 00:11:39,296
I really think that
you should just...

149
00:11:39,297 --> 00:11:41,831
What're you guys talking about?

150
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:42,803
Nothing.

151
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:45,603
Do it.

152
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:29,205
Thanks. Thanks for the help.
You're...

153
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:32,209
Ow! What the...
Hell, my...

154
00:13:38,482 --> 00:13:42,119
Hey, James.
Yes, ma'am?

155
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,922
I was wondering, you
didn't happen to notice

156
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:47,358
anyone else here camping
last night, did you?

157
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,360
No. Not that
I know of. Why?

158
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,130
No reason.

159
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,464
It's just I saw a car leaving
earlier this morning.

160
00:13:55,465 --> 00:13:57,104
It looked like the one
from last night.

161
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,238
Well, we are still kind
of close to the highway.

162
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:03,106
I know.

163
00:14:03,107 --> 00:14:05,043
You don't think that guy had
any bad intentions yesterday,

164
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,976
do you?

165
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:08,215
Nah, he seemed friendly enough.

166
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:11,383
I figure if he was going
to do us any harm,

167
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,517
he would've done it last night.

168
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:16,509
Yeah, you're probably right.

169
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:41,177
Hey! What the
fuck are you doing?

170
00:14:41,178 --> 00:14:43,414
Oh, what you thought I was
actually going to take that road?

171
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,648
Why not?

172
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:47,283
What are the chances of that
guy telling us it's faster,

173
00:14:47,284 --> 00:14:49,020
we take it and then
get completely lost?

174
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,179
You've got a point.

175
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:17,547
So, Kyle, do you
have a girlfriend?

176
00:15:17,548 --> 00:15:19,282
No.

177
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:20,351
No, no, don't let him fool you.

178
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:23,052
He's got lots of lady friends.

179
00:15:23,053 --> 00:15:24,186
Who knows, Kyle,
maybe we can find you

180
00:15:24,187 --> 00:15:26,159
a little hillbilly girl to
hang out with out here, huh?

181
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,562
What about you, Brooke?

182
00:15:31,562 --> 00:15:35,165
No. No boyfriend for me
at the moment.

183
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,467
I'm probably going
to grad school.

184
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,471
You know, trying to
keep my options open.

185
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,076
Really?
Yeah, why?

186
00:15:45,076 --> 00:15:48,345
Just never really
talked about that.

187
00:15:48,346 --> 00:15:51,120
Well, it's something that I've
been thinking about by myself.

188
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,275
Hey can you pull over soon?
I have to pee.

189
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:21,244
Hey, I'm gonna go
in those trees.

190
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:22,480
I'm gonna come keep a look out.

191
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,281
No. No, no.
I'll be fine.

192
00:16:24,282 --> 00:16:25,618
I'll be within earshot.

193
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,403
Got to take a piss anyway.

194
00:16:45,403 --> 00:16:46,371
Oh, there we go.

195
00:16:50,341 --> 00:16:52,341
Oh, come on, man!

196
00:16:52,342 --> 00:16:54,545
Oh, no, don't "come
on" me, that's cute.

197
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,214
Go on.

198
00:16:57,215 --> 00:16:59,351
There we go. Oh!

199
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:01,320
Okay, rub his belly.

200
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,355
Okay, now go lower.

201
00:17:04,355 --> 00:17:05,289
Just kidding.

202
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,458
Wonderful work,
ladies and gentlemen.

203
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:11,095
Those ought to be good.
Maybe.

204
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:13,463
Just because
he's a good photographer.

205
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:14,566
So, what's the story with Will?

206
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,333
He seems like a nice guy.

207
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:19,236
Oh, he's a great guy.
We met in high school.

208
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:21,270
Always had a camera
in his hand.

209
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:23,339
Yeah, you two seem to
be really good friends.

210
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,444
Yeah, we are.

211
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:30,581
Well, it was actually his idea to
come out here and take pictures

212
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:31,487
to go with my thesis.

213
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,588
Pretty interesting, huh?

214
00:17:37,588 --> 00:17:39,588
Not really.

215
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:10,422
Hey, Brooke, you ready?

216
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,644
Holy shit!

217
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:33,743
What was that?

218
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:35,379
I'm sorry, baby.

219
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,645
I just thought we'd have
a little bit of fun

220
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:38,518
while we're out here
in the middle of nowhere.

221
00:18:40,518 --> 00:18:42,953
That's not exactly the
kind of fun I had in mind.

222
00:18:42,954 --> 00:18:45,221
What kind of fun
did you have in mind?

223
00:18:45,222 --> 00:18:47,524
Do you wanna fuck
right here in the woods?

224
00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:50,630
Uh-huh. You know,
I do have the camera.

225
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,530
Uh-huh.
Mmm.

226
00:18:54,531 --> 00:18:55,665
Psych.

227
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,401
What do you mean, psych?

228
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,970
What? Is it the rain?
You fell for it. Yes.

229
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:00,872
It's too wet to do that here.

230
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:04,208
It can get a lot wetter out here.
Ah!

231
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,976
What? What the fuck?

232
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:07,977
- Come on.
- What was that?

233
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,346
What was what?

234
00:19:10,347 --> 00:19:13,249
I heard a noise.
Hang on.

235
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,787
Will, I heard a noise.
I didn't hear anything.

236
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,355
What the fuck were you
doing with my sister?

237
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:19,655
Kyle, stop!

238
00:19:19,656 --> 00:19:20,756
Were you spying on her?

239
00:19:20,757 --> 00:19:21,992
No, this isn't what
it looks like.

240
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:23,559
No, Kyle!
Come on. Stop!

241
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,796
No, I wasn't.
Let me see your camera.

242
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:26,363
Why?
Because I want to see the camera.

243
00:19:26,364 --> 00:19:27,699
Why?
I want to see the fucking camera.

244
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,533
Let me see
the goddamn pictures.

245
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:30,834
I'll show you the pictures.
Stop it.

246
00:19:31,001 --> 00:19:32,568
Give me the fucking camera.
Stop it!

247
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:35,271
Ahhh!
Whoa! Whoa! What happened?

248
00:19:35,272 --> 00:19:36,505
This fucking pervert
was spying,

249
00:19:36,506 --> 00:19:38,476
probably taking
pictures of Brooke.

250
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,675
No, I wasn't.

251
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:41,311
You know what?
This guy is fucking nuts.

252
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:43,380
You're fucking kidding me.
Hey! Hey!

253
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:46,249
Kyle, chill.
Will wouldn't do that.

254
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,551
I don't know, what the
fuck he would do.

255
00:19:47,552 --> 00:19:49,819
Will's my boyfriend, Kyle!
All right?

256
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,323
We've been seeing
each other for months.

257
00:19:52,323 --> 00:19:53,592
What... What?

258
00:19:54,592 --> 00:19:56,263
It's true. You need
to chill out, Kyle.

259
00:19:59,263 --> 00:20:00,797
Let's just drop it, okay?

260
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:02,800
There's no sense in getting
pissed at each other.

261
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,368
Let's get back to the car.

262
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:06,617
We've gotta keep moving.

263
00:20:20,617 --> 00:20:21,617
- Fuck!
- You okay?

264
00:21:17,674 --> 00:21:20,913
Phew! You really know how to pick
a place, you know that, James?

265
00:21:22,913 --> 00:21:26,452
So, we're here now.
Where do we go?

266
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,354
Hungry?
Starving.

267
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:31,521
Let's stop and get some food.

268
00:21:31,522 --> 00:21:33,609
If we can find a place.

269
00:22:31,682 --> 00:22:34,626
Why is everyone staring at us?
I don't know.

270
00:22:42,626 --> 00:22:44,028
Hi, ma'am.
Hi there, young man.

271
00:22:45,028 --> 00:22:46,863
What can I do for you?

272
00:22:46,864 --> 00:22:48,732
We were wondering if we
could get some food?

273
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:51,672
Certainly. What would you like?
Just whatever.

274
00:22:54,672 --> 00:22:57,009
Burgers, fries, and sodas for all 5 of us.
Of course.

275
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:01,914
Uh, ma'am, do you
have veggie burgers?

276
00:23:03,914 --> 00:23:05,649
She's a vegetarian.

277
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,982
No, I'm sorry.

278
00:23:06,983 --> 00:23:09,887
We don't get many
of those around here.

279
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:13,489
I'll just have some fries.

280
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,760
That'll be $15.

281
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,064
What? That's it?

282
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,565
Thank you.

283
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,500
Let me ask you something.

284
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:26,573
Why does everyone here
have a staring problem?

285
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,773
Well, it's because

286
00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:32,046
we don't get many
strangers around here.

287
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,048
Oh, yeah?
Why is that?

288
00:23:38,048 --> 00:23:39,816
Well, there are a lot of folks

289
00:23:39,817 --> 00:23:41,786
who don't like people
they don't know

290
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,819
around them and their families,

291
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,855
and farms and such.

292
00:23:45,856 --> 00:23:47,624
Jeez, paranoid much?

293
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:48,792
Well, we mean you no harm.

294
00:23:48,793 --> 00:23:50,927
No. I'm sure.

295
00:23:50,928 --> 00:23:52,863
Why don't you kids have a seat.

296
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,738
Your food will be ready
in a few minutes.

297
00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:03,539
So, ma'am...
Erma.

298
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,108
Erma. Uh, you wouldn't
happen to know

299
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:07,978
David Randall would you?

300
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:10,614
David Randall... Hmm.

301
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,717
Nope. Sorry,
doesn't ring a bell.

302
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,855
Well, he's the writer of this
book, Devil in the Woods.

303
00:24:17,855 --> 00:24:20,559
Oh, that David Randall.

304
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,661
Yes, ma'am. What can
you tell me about him?

305
00:24:24,662 --> 00:24:26,000
He's long gone,
as far as I know.

306
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,969
What about Damien Ewell?

307
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,573
Oh, Damien Ewell's
just a made-up person.

308
00:24:36,574 --> 00:24:39,010
Doesn't exist,
just like that book.

309
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,945
But the letters.
I've been getting letters.

310
00:24:42,946 --> 00:24:44,814
Oh!

311
00:24:44,815 --> 00:24:47,683
Someone was
playing a prank on you.

312
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:53,896
All right. Thanks.

313
00:24:59,896 --> 00:25:01,698
So, what'd she say?

314
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:03,702
She says, David isn't here
and Damien isn't real.

315
00:25:05,702 --> 00:25:06,835
You're joking, right?

316
00:25:06,836 --> 00:25:08,905
Please tell me we didn't
come all the way down here

317
00:25:08,906 --> 00:25:11,040
for someone who isn't real.
He is real.

318
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:13,541
And David is here. I have
the letters to prove it.

319
00:25:15,813 --> 00:25:17,148
Well, I guess we're
gonna need more than that.

320
00:25:18,148 --> 00:25:19,183
What are you doing?

321
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,729
I'm going outside.
I'm coming too.

322
00:25:31,729 --> 00:25:34,831
So, where are we going?

323
00:25:34,832 --> 00:25:36,603
I don't know, I just wanted
to see what was down here.

324
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:41,704
Oh, I wonder
who these belong to.

325
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:43,139
Damien.

326
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,874
They're his trophies.

327
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:47,713
Oh, look, there's a nice spot
for a car right over there.

328
00:25:49,713 --> 00:25:52,952
Uh, do you think she was
telling the truth about David?

329
00:25:54,952 --> 00:25:56,085
I don't know.

330
00:25:56,086 --> 00:25:57,855
She seemed a little off.

331
00:25:58,855 --> 00:26:00,856
I can't believe
he lives out here.

332
00:26:00,857 --> 00:26:01,928
He's like a hermit.

333
00:26:03,928 --> 00:26:04,998
Yeah.

334
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:10,666
Maybe he's a lone
rider kinda guy.

335
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:12,167
You know, like your brother.

336
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:16,976
Um... I'm sorry
about him, earlier.

337
00:26:18,976 --> 00:26:21,880
No, no. Don't be.
He overreacts sometimes.

338
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,046
No. The guy
doesn't like me.

339
00:26:24,047 --> 00:26:25,018
That's not overreacting.

340
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:29,655
Dad's told him some stuff
that he's heard about you.

341
00:26:31,655 --> 00:26:33,423
Bad reputations never
leave you in small towns,

342
00:26:33,424 --> 00:26:34,857
do they?

343
00:26:34,858 --> 00:26:36,028
Well, what's my reputation?

344
00:26:38,028 --> 00:26:41,931
You are the cute,
innocent girl next door

345
00:26:41,932 --> 00:26:43,135
that got swept away
by the dashing rebel.

346
00:26:45,135 --> 00:26:47,770
Then why am I with you?

347
00:26:47,771 --> 00:26:50,739
Because I'm irresistible.

348
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,540
Mmm-hmm.
Uh-huh.

349
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:53,441
And I'm going to use that
to win over your dad

350
00:26:53,442 --> 00:26:54,878
and he's going to love me too.

351
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,746
And you think that'll work?
Yeah.

352
00:26:56,747 --> 00:26:58,714
I'm gonna make it work.

353
00:26:58,715 --> 00:27:01,152
Because I don't want Kyle
tagging along on our honeymoon.

354
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:02,818
Not funny.
Funny?

355
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:03,919
You should have heard
what I was going to say.

356
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,022
Will, come on.
We're leaving!

357
00:27:06,022 --> 00:27:07,162
Duty calls.

358
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:12,844
You're ready to go?
Mmm-hmm.

359
00:27:26,844 --> 00:27:29,844
- Where you've been?
- So what's the plan?

360
00:27:29,846 --> 00:27:31,714
We're gonna go
to David's house.

361
00:27:31,715 --> 00:27:32,980
I got the woman to tell
me where the address is.

362
00:27:32,981 --> 00:27:33,815
And we're going to trust
some old lady

363
00:27:33,816 --> 00:27:35,152
who lives in the middle
of the woods?

364
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,053
Got no other choice.

365
00:27:37,054 --> 00:27:38,271
Let me get a quick
shot of the diner.

366
00:27:59,143 --> 00:28:00,084
Oh! Sorry.

367
00:28:07,084 --> 00:28:09,318
What exactly are you
takin' pictures of?

368
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:12,324
My friends and I are doing a
write-up on Madison County.

369
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:15,324
- Is that so?
- Mmm-hmm.

370
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,326
Well, you see this is
my truck right here,

371
00:28:17,327 --> 00:28:19,098
and I don't appreciate
you takin' pictures of it.

372
00:28:22,098 --> 00:28:24,901
Well, you see, I don't want anything
to do with you or your truck.

373
00:28:24,902 --> 00:28:26,942
So why don't you
move it out of my shot?

374
00:28:31,942 --> 00:28:33,112
Want to say that again?

375
00:28:35,112 --> 00:28:37,826
It'd be in your best interest
to put that knife away.

376
00:28:48,826 --> 00:28:51,028
You kids best be getting out
of here while you still can.

377
00:28:52,028 --> 00:28:55,167
He'll be gettin' wind of you
soon and when he does...

378
00:29:12,282 --> 00:29:14,058
Shit. Thank you. I can't
believe you did that.

379
00:29:22,058 --> 00:29:24,196
Oh, my God. Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.

380
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:28,979
Did you see that?
Yeah.

381
00:29:41,979 --> 00:29:44,413
I think we should leave.
We're not leaving.

382
00:29:44,414 --> 00:29:46,349
That guy pulled
a knife on us, James!

383
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,854
You've never seen
a knife before?

384
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,422
People get robbed daily
in big cities,

385
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:53,056
and they don't move away.

386
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:54,325
No, that doesn't make it
any better, James.

387
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,092
We're staying.

388
00:29:56,093 --> 00:29:58,061
We leave now, then all that
shit we just went through

389
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:00,896
was for nothing.

390
00:30:00,897 --> 00:30:02,433
Will got a knife pulled on him.
So what?

391
00:30:03,433 --> 00:30:05,200
You get your interview,
you get your pictures,

392
00:30:05,201 --> 00:30:06,304
and we get the hell
out of here.

393
00:30:07,304 --> 00:30:08,971
If we leave now,

394
00:30:08,972 --> 00:30:12,275
we're making a bigger
deal than it should be.

395
00:30:12,276 --> 00:30:13,342
We'll just try to stay
out of harm's way...

396
00:30:13,343 --> 00:30:14,413
Look out!

397
00:30:17,413 --> 00:30:20,916
What the fuck?
What the fuck was that?

398
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:22,351
Fuck who it was,
we almost hit him!

399
00:30:22,352 --> 00:30:23,321
Did you not see his face?

400
00:30:25,321 --> 00:30:26,922
Yeah, it's called inbreeding.

401
00:30:29,326 --> 00:30:33,195
♪ And we'd mellow out
in the light of the sun

402
00:30:33,196 --> 00:30:34,031

Do you think it's safe?

411
00:31:07,397 --> 00:31:09,499
I don't wanna get shot at
or anything like that.

412
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,269
No, we'll be fine.
Come on.

413
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:46,302
Hello?

414
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,315
Anybody home?

415
00:32:47,096 --> 00:32:48,371
Hello?

416
00:32:54,371 --> 00:32:55,424
Hey! Open up!

417
00:33:14,424 --> 00:33:15,134
Let's go.

418
00:33:24,134 --> 00:33:26,268
No one's home.
Let's leave.

419
00:33:26,269 --> 00:33:28,135
So we drove all this way
to grab some food

420
00:33:28,136 --> 00:33:29,438
and knock on someone's door?

421
00:33:29,439 --> 00:33:31,338
Sounds like something
I would say.

422
00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:32,643
Because it's stupid.
We're not leaving.

423
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:34,311
Then what are we
supposed to do?

424
00:33:35,311 --> 00:33:36,644
We need to go back
to the diner,

425
00:33:36,645 --> 00:33:38,449
get more information
from those people.

426
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,283
I'll go.
What?

427
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:42,418
I'll go back to the diner.

428
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:44,519
Shouldn't we stay together?

429
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,156
Obviously, he can
take care of himself.

430
00:33:47,156 --> 00:33:48,090
Look, I'll be fine.

431
00:33:48,091 --> 00:33:49,327
Ask to use their phone
when you get there.

432
00:33:51,327 --> 00:33:53,664
Yeah, no problem.

433
00:33:54,664 --> 00:33:56,399
Hey, Kyle!

434
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,269
Here, take the car.

435
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:00,438
It'll be faster.

436
00:34:01,438 --> 00:34:02,197
Just be careful.

437
00:34:27,197 --> 00:34:29,564
Hi there, young man.
Hi.

438
00:34:29,565 --> 00:34:33,368
Um... You said 1201 Country Lane

439
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:35,138
is a few miles down the road.

440
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,707
One with the gated drive, right?
Yes, sir.

441
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,375
There's no one there.

442
00:34:39,376 --> 00:34:41,576
Of course not.

443
00:34:41,577 --> 00:34:44,247
He left about the time
his book came out.

444
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,149
Did Damien Ewell kill him?

445
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,517
Oh! I told your friend,

446
00:34:48,518 --> 00:34:52,654
Damien Ewell is
a made-up character.

447
00:34:52,655 --> 00:34:56,359
Where would he get the ideas
for the book if it's not true?

448
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,463
People's imaginations
run wild sometimes.

449
00:35:00,463 --> 00:35:02,497
People around here,
they didn't like it much

450
00:35:02,498 --> 00:35:04,533
that he was telling stories
about them, right?

451
00:35:04,534 --> 00:35:07,636
He made small town
people look bad.

452
00:35:07,637 --> 00:35:10,608
Does David have any family in
the area that we can visit?

453
00:35:11,608 --> 00:35:16,279
No, his family is all
passed, many years ago.

454
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,581
Would you mind telling me where
the nearest cemetery is?

455
00:35:18,582 --> 00:35:20,960
Not at all.

456
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,762
Hey, what about
that barn down there?

457
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:34,397
Should we go look around?

458
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:36,668
It might have something
with his name on it.

459
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,233
You know, it could be
where Damien took

460
00:35:39,234 --> 00:35:40,572
the dead body of David Randall.

461
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:43,538
Doubtful.

462
00:35:43,539 --> 00:35:45,674
Wait. Why, you don't think
this guy's dead?

463
00:35:45,675 --> 00:35:48,810
Not if he's been
sending me letters, no.

464
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:50,779
Where is he?

465
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,717
And why does everyone around here
act like they don't know this guy?

466
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:56,785
I don't know.

467
00:35:56,786 --> 00:35:59,388
I'll tell you why? It's because
they're covering something up.

468
00:35:59,389 --> 00:36:00,992
Well, what does the book say?

469
00:36:02,992 --> 00:36:04,833
May I?

470
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:13,703
Here we go,
story of Damien Ewell.

471
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:18,274
"Damien was the most dangerous,
undiscovered serial killer in America.

472
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:21,478
"He killed an estimated
33 people. Maybe more.

473
00:36:22,478 --> 00:36:24,856
"And no one ever
said a word about it."

474
00:36:32,856 --> 00:36:34,293
What the fuck, man?

475
00:36:36,293 --> 00:36:37,728
"He was born in the 1970s.

476
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:40,562
"His mother was
a great and loving woman,

477
00:36:40,563 --> 00:36:44,302
"until one day, she met a man
that was from out of town.

478
00:36:45,302 --> 00:36:46,333
"He eventually moved in

479
00:36:46,334 --> 00:36:47,471
"and became the closest thing

480
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:49,474
"Damien ever had to a father.

481
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:52,741
"But they still
didn't get along."

482
00:36:52,742 --> 00:36:54,846
Hey, are you okay?

483
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,849
I saw you was up here snoopin'.

484
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,751
You ain't with them police,
is you?

485
00:37:01,751 --> 00:37:04,352
Police? No.

486
00:37:04,353 --> 00:37:06,622
What police?

487
00:37:06,623 --> 00:37:07,755
They was looking for
the missing girl.

488
00:37:11,527 --> 00:37:13,465
Have anything to do
with Damien Ewell?

489
00:37:15,465 --> 00:37:17,500
I reckon so.

490
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:20,303
"Around the age of 11
Damien ran away from home

491
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:23,608
"and was found days later on the
side of the road, left for dead.

492
00:37:25,608 --> 00:37:27,445
"One of the people
in the town found him.

493
00:37:29,445 --> 00:37:31,546
"He was badly disfigured.

494
00:37:31,547 --> 00:37:34,452
"He'd been tortured to
within an inch of his life.

495
00:37:35,452 --> 00:37:36,621
"They took him home
and from there,

496
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:40,488
"the townspeople
became very paranoid.

497
00:37:40,489 --> 00:37:42,927
"Someone had hurt
one of their own."

498
00:37:44,927 --> 00:37:47,696
Did they ever find out
who did it?

499
00:37:47,697 --> 00:37:49,799
It was his mother's boyfriend.

500
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,100
That sounds made-up.
It's not.

501
00:37:52,101 --> 00:37:53,803
What happened to him?

502
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:56,339
He died.

503
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,573
Well, did someone kill
this guy, the boyfriend?

504
00:37:58,574 --> 00:38:01,843
It doesn't say.
Well, that's great.

505
00:38:01,844 --> 00:38:03,677
And here we are,
asking people questions,

506
00:38:03,678 --> 00:38:05,615
I'm sure they don't want
to give the answers to.

507
00:38:06,615 --> 00:38:08,750
You said something
about a girl.

508
00:38:08,751 --> 00:38:10,922
What girl?

509
00:38:12,922 --> 00:38:14,126
Her daddy was sure
Damien did it.

510
00:38:17,126 --> 00:38:18,727
Do you know Erma?

511
00:38:18,728 --> 00:38:20,830
Don't you get it?

512
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,632
They was the ones
that was in on it.

513
00:38:23,632 --> 00:38:24,436
What do you mean?

514
00:38:27,436 --> 00:38:29,440
Hey, I'm not snooping.

515
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,612
Hey, where are you going?

516
00:38:55,398 --> 00:38:56,865
You guys go down
to the end of the driveway.

517
00:38:56,866 --> 00:38:58,603
We'll check the barns
and the house.

518
00:39:00,603 --> 00:39:01,882
Huh! Great.

519
00:39:12,882 --> 00:39:14,512
Come on, let's go poke around.

520
00:39:43,512 --> 00:39:45,747
So, what are we looking for?

521
00:39:45,748 --> 00:39:47,715
Honestly?
I'm not even sure.

522
00:39:47,716 --> 00:39:49,219
Who would've ever thought it
would be this much trouble

523
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,986
to interview a person?
Yeah. No joke.

524
00:39:51,987 --> 00:39:53,922
You know it would
be really easy

525
00:39:53,923 --> 00:39:55,561
to just pack up and go home.

526
00:39:58,561 --> 00:40:00,230
So you're siding with
Brooke and Will now?

527
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,466
No. It just seems like
a lot to go through

528
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:04,503
just to write a paper,
don't you think?

529
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:07,769
And wouldn't it be
a huge waste of time

530
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,604
to pack up, drive
all the way out here,

531
00:40:09,605 --> 00:40:11,742
and turn around and go home
after just a couple of hours?

532
00:40:12,742 --> 00:40:13,542
Touche.

533
00:40:29,092 --> 00:40:31,560
So, Jenna,

534
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:33,929
what brings you all the way
out to Madison County?

535
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,531
Well, once upon a time

536
00:40:36,532 --> 00:40:38,567
there was a really
nice guy named James

537
00:40:38,568 --> 00:40:41,604
who sat behind me in my English class.
Really now?

538
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,804
Yeah, he dragged me
all the way out here

539
00:40:42,805 --> 00:40:44,010
to write a paper on some
book I've never read.

540
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,012
Why didn't you read the book?

541
00:40:49,012 --> 00:40:50,847
Because I've got better
things to do with my time.

542
00:40:51,847 --> 00:40:53,749
Okay.

543
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,052
And what did you think
of this James guy?

544
00:40:57,052 --> 00:40:59,587
He was a bit
of a pig, actually.

545
00:40:59,588 --> 00:41:00,922
Oh, yeah? How so?

546
00:41:00,923 --> 00:41:04,697
Well, occasionally, I would catch
him staring at my ass in class.

547
00:41:07,697 --> 00:41:09,065
And you saw him doing this?

548
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:11,933
I sure did.

549
00:41:11,934 --> 00:41:14,870
And how come you never brought
this to his attention?

550
00:41:14,871 --> 00:41:17,043
Because I told you earlier,
I didn't mind.

551
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:38,128
Hey!

552
00:41:39,128 --> 00:41:40,696
It's open.

553
00:41:40,697 --> 00:41:42,897
Should we go in?

554
00:41:42,898 --> 00:41:46,143
Yeah, yeah, I am. You can
stay here if you want.

555
00:41:54,143 --> 00:41:55,650
Hello?

556
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:02,450
Hello?

557
00:42:10,059 --> 00:42:11,030
Holy shit!

558
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,201
Look at this.

559
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:20,935
Is that the guy
from the highway?

560
00:42:20,936 --> 00:42:22,672
Looks like him, doesn't it?

561
00:42:23,672 --> 00:42:25,640
It says David.

562
00:42:25,641 --> 00:42:28,176
Do you think that
means David Randall?

563
00:42:28,177 --> 00:42:30,615
I can't imagine
who else it would be.

564
00:42:32,615 --> 00:42:33,788
What's this?

565
00:42:38,788 --> 00:42:40,858
Daddy, Erma, David

566
00:42:41,858 --> 00:42:42,858
and Damien.

567
00:42:44,027 --> 00:42:45,963
Hey, Brooke!

568
00:42:46,963 --> 00:42:48,166
Jenna, is that you?

569
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:06,119
This place definitely
has a lot of...

570
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,119
- Sorry.
- Stop.

571
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,697
Let's check this out over here.

572
00:43:20,697 --> 00:43:22,677
Shit.

573
00:43:34,677 --> 00:43:35,477
Jesus!

574
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:41,149
Looks like a mangled
dungeon master lives here.

575
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,085
Looks like someone
still lives here.

576
00:43:43,086 --> 00:43:44,059
Yeah.

577
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:50,125
Don't do that.

578
00:43:50,126 --> 00:43:51,727
It's okay.

579
00:43:51,728 --> 00:43:52,827
This is turning
into so much work.

580
00:43:52,828 --> 00:43:55,164
I thought this was going
to be a nice trip for us.

581
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:58,033
It will, it will.

582
00:43:58,034 --> 00:44:02,837
As soon as we're done with James'
stuff, we'll get out of here, okay?

583
00:44:02,838 --> 00:44:06,075
We'll spend a few relaxing
days in the woods.

584
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:08,042
Just you and me.

585
00:44:08,043 --> 00:44:10,279
Can my brother come?

586
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,023
That's not funny.

587
00:44:20,023 --> 00:44:21,195
Oh, that's weird.

588
00:44:26,195 --> 00:44:28,501
Hey guys, where'd you go?

589
00:44:32,501 --> 00:44:33,007
Hey!

590
00:44:39,007 --> 00:44:41,855
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought
you were someone else.

591
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,955
I wonder why Kyle's
not back yet.

592
00:44:53,956 --> 00:44:56,091
Do you think he got lost?

593
00:44:56,092 --> 00:44:57,327
Maybe.

594
00:44:58,327 --> 00:45:00,229
I think I'd better go find him.

595
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,064
Well, you're not
leaving me here.

596
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,133
It'll be fine.
I'll just run down there,

597
00:45:05,134 --> 00:45:07,134
it'll be quicker
if I'm by myself.

598
00:45:08,003 --> 00:45:10,839
What, are you trying to
call me fat or something?

599
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,376
There's not an ounce
of fat on your body.

600
00:45:13,376 --> 00:45:15,243
Go catch up to Will and Brooke.

601
00:45:15,244 --> 00:45:17,851
I'll meet you guys
back up here.

602
00:45:21,851 --> 00:45:23,118
Jenna?

603
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,268
Yeah?

604
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:39,273
Be careful.

605
00:45:44,273 --> 00:45:47,880
Oh, I'm Kyle.
What's your names?

606
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,018
All right.
Fuck me, man.

607
00:45:56,018 --> 00:45:58,998
Mind if I join you
guys down there?

608
00:46:08,998 --> 00:46:10,873
What, me?

609
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,277
Smells really weird in here.

610
00:46:55,277 --> 00:46:56,315
Musty.

611
00:46:59,315 --> 00:47:01,320
That's quite an antler
collection he's got.

612
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,355
Look at this.

613
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:08,991
What are you going
to do with that?

614
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,125
I don't know.

615
00:47:11,126 --> 00:47:12,197
Bend over, I'll show you.

616
00:47:14,197 --> 00:47:15,230
Will!

617
00:47:15,231 --> 00:47:17,064
Come on?

618
00:47:17,065 --> 00:47:19,468
Yeah, I think I'm going
to hold on to this.

619
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:21,373
In case we run into any bears
or maybe I get a base hit.

620
00:47:25,007 --> 00:47:26,244
Get out of here.

621
00:48:02,244 --> 00:48:04,413
No mailbox.

622
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:08,351
I guess the whole not rain, nor sleet,
nor snow thing doesn't apply out here.

623
00:48:09,351 --> 00:48:11,289
Wait, what about
that "posted" sign?

624
00:48:13,289 --> 00:48:16,223
It's got to account
for something.

625
00:48:16,224 --> 00:48:18,094
Maybe we'll run into
a neighbor who will tell us

626
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:20,261
that we're as crazy
as the old lady did.

627
00:48:20,262 --> 00:48:23,098
Maybe we should just go back.

628
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:24,533
What if someone's home?

629
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:26,168
Well, they obviously
don't want to be bothered,

630
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:28,206
or they wouldn't live out here.

631
00:48:30,206 --> 00:48:31,439
Ah, come on.

632
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,324
Oh, God!

633
00:48:48,324 --> 00:48:50,998
It's a real
fixer-upper.

634
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,481
Got it?

635
00:49:12,481 --> 00:49:14,383
Looks like nobody's home.

636
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:18,120
Well, let's go meet
with James and Jenna then.

637
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,222
Hey, Brooke?

638
00:49:20,222 --> 00:49:21,059
Yeah?

639
00:49:23,059 --> 00:49:26,160
The stuff you said before,
about grad school,

640
00:49:26,161 --> 00:49:28,129
are you serious about that?

641
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,297
Why?

642
00:49:30,298 --> 00:49:33,502
I don't know. I was just
wondering, that's all.

643
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:35,606
Will, don't be gay.

644
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:38,378
Yeah.

645
00:49:42,378 --> 00:49:43,222
Gay! Jesus!

646
00:49:53,222 --> 00:49:55,089
Come on, let's go.

647
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:56,458
Actually, can you just
give me a quick second?

648
00:49:56,459 --> 00:49:59,093
I'm gonna take a quick
piss somewhere over there.

649
00:49:59,094 --> 00:50:01,395
Okay. Do you want me
to come with you?

650
00:50:01,396 --> 00:50:03,298
Why, you wanna hold it
or something, huh?

651
00:50:03,299 --> 00:50:05,366
No!
No?

652
00:50:05,367 --> 00:50:06,635
Well, then, hang tight,
I'll be right back.

653
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:08,862
Okay.

654
00:50:32,862 --> 00:50:34,498
Hey!

655
00:50:36,498 --> 00:50:37,715
Hey!

656
00:51:26,715 --> 00:51:28,286
Brooke?

657
00:51:30,286 --> 00:51:32,574
Decided you wanted to hold it?

658
00:51:53,742 --> 00:51:55,447
Will?

659
00:51:58,447 --> 00:52:00,349
Who the fuck are you, huh?

660
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:02,753
Huh?

661
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,697
Ahhh!

662
00:52:14,697 --> 00:52:16,434
No! Wait!

663
00:52:19,434 --> 00:52:20,204
Please!

664
00:52:22,204 --> 00:52:24,372
Wait! Wait! Wait!

665
00:52:24,373 --> 00:52:25,447
Ahhh!

666
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:35,554
Will! No!

667
00:52:38,554 --> 00:52:39,354
Ahhh!

668
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,840
Brooke!
Brooke, over here!

669
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,311
Jenna, he got Will!

670
00:53:02,311 --> 00:53:03,410
Who?

671
00:53:03,411 --> 00:53:04,745
Who got Will?

672
00:53:04,746 --> 00:53:07,448
I don't know. I don't know.
It's some man!

673
00:53:07,449 --> 00:53:09,552
He killed him, Jenna,
he killed him!

674
00:53:10,552 --> 00:53:12,754
He killed him?

675
00:53:12,755 --> 00:53:15,323
You saw this?

676
00:53:15,324 --> 00:53:17,558
Jenna, we gotta go.
We gotta get help.

677
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:18,746
Please!

678
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:38,647
Oh, my!
Where's Kyle?

679
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:39,747
Are you okay?

680
00:53:39,748 --> 00:53:41,683
My friend.
From earlier.

681
00:53:41,684 --> 00:53:43,552
Yes, dear. He was here.

682
00:53:44,552 --> 00:53:45,620
And?

683
00:53:45,621 --> 00:53:46,757
And he left.

684
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:49,758
Where did he go?

685
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:53,597
He went to find some answers,
that's what he told me.

686
00:53:54,597 --> 00:53:56,631
Now, tell me everything
that happened.

687
00:53:56,632 --> 00:53:58,068
He came out of nowhere.

688
00:53:59,068 --> 00:54:00,602
Who?

689
00:54:00,603 --> 00:54:02,370
I don't know.

690
00:54:02,371 --> 00:54:03,837
Keep walking.

691
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:06,508
Was it the man
from the highway?

692
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:07,876
Was it the man with the knife?

693
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:09,780
I don't know.
Jenna!

694
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,516
There wasn't anybody at that
old house you sent us to.

695
00:54:14,516 --> 00:54:16,884
Oh! Of course not.

696
00:54:16,885 --> 00:54:20,654
I told you David hadn't
lived here in many years.

697
00:54:20,655 --> 00:54:22,656
Bullshit!

698
00:54:22,657 --> 00:54:24,859
There was nothing
I could do, Jenna.

699
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:28,395
Oh, sweetie, don't even think
about something like that, okay?

700
00:54:28,396 --> 00:54:31,867
We're going to get help and
everything is going to be fine, okay?

701
00:54:32,867 --> 00:54:35,806
Are you calling me a liar?

702
00:54:37,806 --> 00:54:40,607
I'm saying that I don't think
you're telling me the truth.

703
00:54:40,608 --> 00:54:43,812
Jenna, he got Will.

704
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:45,680
Come on.

705
00:54:45,681 --> 00:54:48,418
I thought David didn't
have any family?

706
00:54:50,418 --> 00:54:51,953
Where did you get that?

707
00:54:51,954 --> 00:54:53,423
Where's his daughter?

708
00:54:55,423 --> 00:54:58,727
I think you better leave now.

709
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:01,436
Why didn't you tell me
you were Damien's mother?

710
00:55:08,436 --> 00:55:10,839
Oh, his face!
It was awful, Jenna.

711
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,880
No, get up.
We have to keep going.

712
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,750
Boy, you have gone and
gotten yourself in a mess

713
00:55:22,751 --> 00:55:25,590
of something you'll
never get out of.

714
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:30,892
You're in too deep.

715
00:55:30,893 --> 00:55:34,166
Best start runnin'.
You'll never get out alive.

716
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:41,541
There's no escape.
There's no escape.

717
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:47,177
He's gonna be
on your scent soon.

718
00:55:49,177 --> 00:55:53,016
And when he is,
you're gonna be dead.

719
00:55:54,016 --> 00:55:56,686
Run! Run!

720
00:55:57,686 --> 00:55:59,721
Bye-bye.

721
00:55:59,722 --> 00:56:01,498
Bye-bye, nice young man.

722
00:56:09,498 --> 00:56:10,905
Please, Jenna!

723
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:18,585
James!
Get in the truck.

724
00:56:32,487 --> 00:56:33,720
I told y'all
to go down Pettigrew.

725
00:56:33,721 --> 00:56:35,891
What? What are you talking about?
Are you David Randall?

726
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,591
Yeah, I'm David Randall.

727
00:56:37,592 --> 00:56:38,927
Why didn't you tell me
that when we first met?

728
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:40,794
It's complicated.

729
00:56:40,795 --> 00:56:43,698
There's so many things that
don't make sense around here.

730
00:56:43,699 --> 00:56:46,533
They'll all make sense
soon enough.

731
00:57:10,826 --> 00:57:11,737
Jenna!

732
00:58:48,623 --> 00:58:49,626
Hey!

733
00:58:50,626 --> 00:58:51,626
Over here!

734
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:29,208
Come on out.

735
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:40,741
Where's my daughter?

736
00:59:40,742 --> 00:59:42,944
Is that the last of 'em?

737
00:59:42,945 --> 00:59:44,990
Sorry, James.

738
01:00:03,431 --> 01:00:05,192
Come on, you son of a bitch!

739
01:00:30,192 --> 01:00:31,471
Ahhh!

740
01:00:42,471 --> 01:00:43,172
Ahhh!

741
01:00:47,476 --> 01:00:49,045
Help!

742
01:00:51,045 --> 01:00:52,212
Help me!

743
01:00:54,016 --> 01:00:55,753
Please!

744
01:00:58,753 --> 01:01:00,059
Help me, please!

745
01:01:04,059 --> 01:01:05,795
Help!
Help!

746
01:01:06,795 --> 01:01:08,300
Help!
Help me!

747
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,871
Help me, please!

748
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:32,047
Jenna.

749
01:03:10,918 --> 01:03:14,128
You kids don't worry none.
He'll be in here soon.

750
01:03:21,128 --> 01:03:23,330
We're never gonna
get out alive.

751
01:03:23,331 --> 01:03:26,269
Don't say that, I'm gonna
get us out of here.

752
01:03:28,269 --> 01:03:30,136
Where am I?

753
01:03:30,137 --> 01:03:31,137
Who is that?

754
01:03:31,138 --> 01:03:31,973
Shh!

755
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:33,640
Just stay quiet.

756
01:03:33,641 --> 01:03:35,347
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

757
01:03:39,347 --> 01:03:40,315
I'm sorry.

758
01:03:41,315 --> 01:03:43,951
I had no choice.

759
01:03:43,952 --> 01:03:45,288
What's going on?
Who are you?

760
01:03:46,288 --> 01:03:47,458
Is this your daughter?

761
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:50,226
Yes.

762
01:03:52,226 --> 01:03:54,361
And this is your plan
to save her?

763
01:03:54,362 --> 01:03:56,129
I had to do something!

764
01:03:56,130 --> 01:03:57,497
You used me as bait!

765
01:03:57,498 --> 01:03:59,978
What are you talking about?

766
01:04:10,978 --> 01:04:12,150
David,

767
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:17,389
where are my friends?

768
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:22,260
If they're not here,
they're dead.

769
01:04:34,001 --> 01:04:36,143
We're never
going to get out of here.

770
01:05:17,211 --> 01:05:20,184
Damien, we've done
nothing to hurt you.

771
01:05:23,184 --> 01:05:25,021
Damien.

772
01:05:27,021 --> 01:05:29,323
Let us go. You'll
never see us again.

773
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:08,246
No!

774
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:38,168
Ahhh!

775
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:47,266
Hey, hey, it's okay.

776
01:06:56,143 --> 01:06:57,163
Look out! Ahhh!

777
01:07:15,163 --> 01:07:17,438
No!

778
01:07:23,438 --> 01:07:25,177
He's lost a lot of blood.

779
01:07:29,177 --> 01:07:31,250
Let's get him out of here.

780
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:21,502
Hurry! Hurry!

781
01:08:28,502 --> 01:08:30,345
Hurry!

782
01:08:37,345 --> 01:08:38,216
Hurry! Hurry!

783
01:08:42,216 --> 01:08:43,255
Dad! No!

784
01:08:47,255 --> 01:08:48,270
No!

785
01:09:30,564 --> 01:09:31,475
Come on.

786
01:11:04,559 --> 01:11:06,595
Howdy there!

787
01:11:08,595 --> 01:11:10,701
Oh, my!

788
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:16,472
My Lord, child.
What happened to you?

789
01:11:18,472 --> 01:11:20,107
The man...

790
01:11:20,108 --> 01:11:23,445
The man with the face.
He killed my friends.

791
01:11:24,445 --> 01:11:26,817
Who killed your friends, missy?

792
01:11:28,817 --> 01:11:29,685
The pig.

793
01:11:30,685 --> 01:11:32,523
Pig head.

794
01:11:35,523 --> 01:11:38,591
Where are my other friends?

795
01:11:38,592 --> 01:11:42,496
Oh, I haven't seen
your friends, dearie.

796
01:11:42,497 --> 01:11:45,965
We've been slow
since I saw you last.

797
01:11:45,966 --> 01:11:49,524
Oh, my, I'll get you
a glass of water.

798
01:12:09,524 --> 01:12:10,563
Here.

799
01:12:15,563 --> 01:12:17,867
Who did you say
killed your friends?

800
01:12:18,867 --> 01:12:20,570
Big pig head.

801
01:12:23,570 --> 01:12:25,641
We don't have a moment to lose.

802
01:12:27,641 --> 01:12:29,977
You go stand by my car.

803
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:34,648
I'll get my keys and I'll take
you to the doctor's house,
