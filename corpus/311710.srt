AMY FOSTER

2
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,634
INSPIRED B Y JOSEPH CONRAD'S
SHORT STORY "AMY FOSTER"

3
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,360
- Look Mama, the sea.
- Yes, the sea.

4
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,349
That is where you came from.

5
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,750
Amy! Amy!

6
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,557
Amy...

7
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,830
My daughter's taken a turn.
She's asked for you.

8
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,308
I sent a man to fetch Dr. Kennedy.

9
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,037
Go on there!

10
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,995
Don't worry, Miss Swaffer.
I won't leave you.

11
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,989
Thank you for your care, Amy.
You'll not be needed further.

12
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,199
Sir, I had intended to stay
here through the night.

13
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,353
If I consider it necessary,
I will stay.

14
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,278
Leave the doctor to attend me, Amy.

15
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,357
God bless you.

16
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,989
Really, Doctor!
Your cruelty was unnecessary.

17
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,839
- Will she die, Mama?
- Dr. Kennedy's with her.

18
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,393
- Who's the doctor?
- Come on, young man.

19
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,470
Why do you hate her so much?

20
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,274
Do you, too,
consider her a simpleton?

21
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,958
It is not my purpose
to consider Amy Foster at all.

22
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,032
You risk gangrene of the blood.

23
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:55,070
I must cut away the poisoned flesh,
or you will die of it tonight.

24
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,360
Perhaps that gives me license
to be bold.

25
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:07,510
Reluctant as you may be
to <i>consider</i> Amy, -

26
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,798
- it would comfort me to know
the tale entire.

27
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,270
- If I am to die...
- You will not die!

28
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,157
I will not permit it.

29
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,151
Perhaps it will ease my fever.
And yours, too.

30
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,760
I dare say no one person
knows the tale entire.

31
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,078
But perhaps I know more than most.

32
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,715
He said he was a mountaineer...

33
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,399
From a remote corner
of the Carpathian Mountains.

34
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,953
<i>They called him Yanko. </i>

35
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:13,189
<i>His family sold a cow and some land</i>
<i>in order to pay for his journey. </i>

36
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:59,397
<i>Yanko carried with him their hopes</i>
<i>and dreams for a better world. </i>

37
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,357
<i>A land of freedom. </i>

38
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,638
<i>He called it</i>
<i>"a land of true gold. "</i>

39
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,475
America!

40
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,996
America!

41
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,391
Yanko...

42
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,588
- <i>Yanko, I'm here!</i>
- Stefan!

43
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:49,189
- We are the lucky ones.
- We are the lucky ones?

44
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,392
<i>Farewell, farewell!</i>

45
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,272
<i>The journey was long and grueling. </i>

46
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,797
<i>Yanko and his companions</i>
<i>were locked in the cattle cars. </i>

47
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,839
<i>Dirty, hungry and cold. </i>

48
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,910
<i>Finally they arrived at the ship</i>
<i>in which they would cross the sea. </i>

49
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,915
HAMBURG, GERMANY

50
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,153
Stefan!

51
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,632
- Stefan!
- <i>We'll meet in America!</i>

52
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,397
- To America!
- To America!

53
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,515
<i>At least he had his dream</i>
<i>for company. </i>

54
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:44,632
- And found himself a nightmare.
- Until he met Amy Foster.

55
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,590
Fate is both inscrutable
and merciless, Miss Swaffer.

56
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,835
You're determined to blame Amy, like
those who say she brought the storm.

57
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,468
You insult me.

58
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:04,670
Witchcraft and other despicable
superstitions are abhorrent to me.

59
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,796
<i>But I won't deny that I always</i>
<i>found her a strange creature. </i>

60
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,719
<i>She was the product</i>
<i>of a family scandal. </i>

61
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:45,318
<i>She was sent to work at Smith's</i>
<i>farm when only twelve years old. </i>

62
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,472
<i>I admit she was a mystery to me. </i>

63
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,430
<i>But I never thought Amy was a witch</i>
<i>or a simpleton. </i>

64
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,275
Go on there, now!

65
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:14,829
Tom, William! Get the horses
down the back meadow, quickly!

66
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,673
The devil is riding this wind!

67
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,389
Tom, get those pigs out of there!

68
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,034
Amy? Amy Foster!

69
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,028
What the bloody hell...?

70
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,952
Amy!

71
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,275
Why are you in the dark?
Go and make Mr. Smith some tea.

72
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,069
- What's up?
- Ship down, in the bay.

73
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:15,355
My boys, my boys!

74
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,036
Where are my fine boys?

75
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:26,197
Don't fret for your boys. It was an
immigrant ship, not one of our own.

76
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,319
Not one of our own...

77
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,473
Praises be.
Praises be to God!

78
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:41,034
- Hold your tongue, Widow Cree!
- The sea will curse me for that.

79
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,636
- 'Tis a curse!
- There, there.

80
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,156
- We will be cursed!
- Quiet!

81
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,952
No one else is going to be cursed!
Not one amongst you.

82
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,999
But we will see our duty done
by this tragic day.

83
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,438
Ladies...
Take care for her.

84
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,709
The rest of us have work to do.

85
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,393
Did you save any, Doctor?

86
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:48,557
I have looked into every face. There
is not a living soul amongst them.

87
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,557
"I was not in safety,
neither had I rest, -

88
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,794
- neither was I quiet.
Yet trouble came. "

89
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,077
There's no more I can do.

90
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,433
These souls are in Your hands now.

91
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,919
The ailments of the living
do not wait upon the dead.

92
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,391
Amy...
For God's sake, bolt the door!

93
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,318
Stay away from that window.

94
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,559
William, William!

95
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,030
There's a beast in the yard!

96
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,558
- What in damnation is going on?
- There's a lunatic in the yard.

97
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,554
By Christ!
I'll get rid of the blackguard.

98
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,235
I'll teach him to go around
frightening women.

99
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,229
I'll sort him out,
that I will.

100
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,235
All right now, let's be having you!

101
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,159
All right, my friend.

102
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:43,032
If you'll bear with me... let's see
if we can't work something out.

103
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,990
<i>Thank you sir, for letting me rest</i>
<i>on your property. </i>

104
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:54,872
- <i>I've done nothing wrong. </i>
- All right, you go down here.

105
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,909
<i>I'm not a beggar,</i>
<i>I'm a traveler. </i>

106
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,715
- Christ almighty!
- Dog, get down, down!

107
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,716
Don't!

108
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,079
- He meant no harm.
- Get you in that house, girl.

109
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,236
Get you in, now!
Get you on with your work.

110
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,595
Can you eat this?

111
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,717
<i>Dear lady... </i>

112
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,114
<i>Dear lady... </i>

113
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,032
Thank you for coming over so prompt.

114
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,912
- He's madder than a March hare.
- Haven't seen one of them in years.

115
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,631
Last time I did,
it seemed like any other variety.

116
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,873
Perhaps you mistake my meaning.
I believe, like others, -

117
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:03,115
- that this creature escaped from
a lunatic asylum. God knows where.

118
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:09,389
Your advice would comfort me.
But maniacs do not lack for cunning.

119
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,792
When I wrestled him in here
he looked like a monster, -

120
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,910
- and it crossed my mind that that's
what he was. Watch yourself, sir.

121
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,832
Why, he was filthy as a pig...

122
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:34,798
Did you open this door?
You could have got us all murdered!

123
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,637
- He was dirty.
- You washed him? Good Christ, girl!

124
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:47,194
If you weren't an idiot, I'd suspect
unnatural practices. Get inside!

125
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:55,119
I'd suggest this man would benefit
from the services of a barber.

126
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,348
But as we both know, such
is not available in these parts.

127
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,478
All too true, sir.

128
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:13,557
Just the same, I do be damned
if I know what to do with him.

129
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,238
He is a funniosity.

130
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,634
That's the last we'll see of him.
Let old Swaffer sort him out!

131
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,429
<i>I won't forget, dear lady!</i>

132
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,151
<i>Never, never!</i>

133
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:56,075
<i>It must have been terrible to be</i>
<i>helpless in a foreign land. </i>

134
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,028
<i>That winter, Yanko endured</i>
<i>overwhelming loneliness. </i>

135
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,433
I'm paid to herd sheep, not dig
ditches for someone else's shit!

136
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,070
Swaffer's forgotten
what century we're in.

137
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,553
You'll just have to do enough
for both of us.

138
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,316
<i>He worked for no wages. </i>
<i>To all intents, a slave. </i>

139
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,430
<i>And he had no language</i>
<i>with which to explain himself. </i>

140
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,310
<i>He told me later, his only comfort</i>
<i>was the memory of the girl</i> -

141
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,790
- <i>who had given him bread. </i>

142
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,469
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if Amy ever thought of him. </i>

143
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,195
<i>Her life continued,</i>
<i>without variation. </i>

144
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:56,114
<i>Each Sunday, she had to visit her</i>
<i>parents, Mary and Isaac Foster. </i>

145
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,595
You're late.

146
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,959
- Mother, Father...
- Why does she come back here?

147
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,432
- She comes to help her mother.
- She's a queer sort.

148
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,195
Is it any wonder,
the way you treat her?

149
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,432
You'd silence the birds
in the trees.

150
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,037
- I put food on her plate...
- <i>She</i> puts food on our table!

151
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,230
- I'll say what I want in my house.
- Your house? It's Swaffer's.

152
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,951
Why remind me of that?
Bloody embarrassment, she is.

153
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,829
- Isaac!
- Picking up rubbish off the beach.

154
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,436
Everybody knows!

155
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,435
Where do you think you're going?

156
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,835
- I'm talking to you, lady!
- Isaac, please!

157
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,472
<i>Isaac had been disinherited</i>
<i>because of his scandalous marriage. </i>

158
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,519
<i>He still blamed Amy</i>
<i>for all their woes. </i>

159
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:12,357
<i>Perhaps that's why she used silence</i>
<i>as a weapon against them. </i>

160
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:19,039
<i>They isolated Amy from the village,</i>
<i>so she gave her love to the sea. </i>

161
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,215
<i>But the sea was not lover enough. </i>

162
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,110
<i>But the sea was not lover enough. </i>

163
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,152
Check.

164
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,997
Well, I'll be damned
if you don't have me again.

165
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:49,029
You've a hard heart at chess, but
don't your laborers get Sunday off?

166
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,749
I don't know if that's
what you'd call him.

167
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,709
Smith caught him in the stack-yard
at New Barns.

168
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,872
Reckons him to be a lunatic.

169
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,953
You've been all over the world.
Tell me, -

170
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,352
- do you think this is a Hindu
we've got here?

171
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:14,036
Not unless he's undergone
an unlikely conversion.

172
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,954
He puts me in mind of the Basques.

173
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,874
<i>Do you speak Spanish, señor?</i>

174
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,875
<i>You are in England. </i>

175
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,594
<i>Do you speak French?</i>
<i>Do you understand?</i>

176
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,354
Thank you, sir.

177
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,717
He's learned a few words
from my daughter.

178
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,077
He seems to call himself
Yankoo Goorall.

179
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:52,553
Yanko! Please...?

180
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,599
Oh... Yes, by all means.

181
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,951
Moscow? Tolstoy, Checkov...

182
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,556
Oh damn... Think, man!

183
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,670
- The Volga? Kiev?
- <i>Kiev is the capital of my country. </i>

184
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,638
Swaffer, he's a Russian!

185
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:47,749
- They're great chess players.
- <i>I was on my way to America. </i>

186
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,272
<i>America. </i>

187
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:59,515
- How long has this man been here?
- Since winter. A couple of months.

188
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,911
- My daughter is better at...
- February 18th.

189
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,870
The day the sea gave up its dead.

190
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:14,309
Swaffer, you have here the only
survivor of the Eastbay disaster.

191
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,556
Dr. James Kennedy.

192
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,832
Kennedy.

193
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:32,996
Do you think he knows...
that all his companions perished?

194
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,592
I don't know...

195
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,917
If you can spare him sometimes,
I would like to teach him English.

196
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,838
I don't see why not.

197
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,473
Perhaps he'll teach you chess, so
your visits are worth the journey.

198
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,070
Sit down.

199
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,511
Eat.

200
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,635
It'll be regular from now on.

201
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,917
It's money.

202
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,197
You'll work daylight hours,
Sundays off.

203
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:15,434
What you do with your own time
is your own business.

204
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,196
There is a girl on the farm...

205
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,796
A girl?
You don't mean our Amy?

206
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,157
Amy? Perhaps it is her name.

207
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,835
A gracious lady...
of great beautiful.

208
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,757
Our Amy? You'd have
as much chance with Swaffer's mare.

209
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,311
And a better time of it too,
I shouldn't wonder!

210
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:17,518
Mr. Swaffer, you brought the lumber!
William will be so pleased.

211
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,310
- He hasn't heard the price yet.
- Come in for some tea.

212
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,270
- A cup of tea would be civilized.
- You two, stay out here.

213
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,988
Thank you.
Thank you.

214
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,638
Hold on, Amy.

215
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,078
Haven't you got a minute for
your poor old father?

216
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,310
Father...

217
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:12,998
This lad here thinks you're a
gracious lady, did you know that?

218
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,394
"Great beautiful!"

219
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:24,156
And you do look
quite fetching in that pinny!

220
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,592
Can't take a joke, see?

221
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,634
Don't you want your cake, then?

222
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:55,549
- No, Kennedy, move no good.
- "That is not a good move. "

223
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,395
"That is not a good move. "
Precisely!

224
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,599
You learn English
faster than I learn chess.

225
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,709
- Miss... helps I, me...
- Miss Swaffer.

226
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,159
Why is Miss in... car-chair?

227
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:20,960
Some twenty years ago,
she was engaged to be married...

228
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,636
On the eve of her wedding day,
she fell from her horse.

229
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,555
She had a passion for riding.
She broke her spine.

230
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:39,391
The marriage was quietly forgotten.
By her intended, if not by her.

231
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,628
That is why she always wears
clothes of black?

232
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,588
It would certainly be reason enough.

233
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,913
Why you have not married, Kennedy?

234
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:04,313
Oh, I was!
A lifetime ago.

235
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:12,673
Two lifetimes... my wife and child.
A son.

236
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:20,514
The typhus epidemic of '74
took them both. On the same night.

237
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:29,032
- But you do not wear black?
- No.

238
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,671
Chess like in the life.

239
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,637
You must look to the forward.

240
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,032
Far to the forward.

241
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,155
Checkmate.

242
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,390
Not so fast!

243
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,549
I've a nice hog's head for you...

244
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,359
There's your ribbon and your change.

245
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,639
Can I help you, sir?

246
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,956
I thought for a moment
it was the Prince of Wales!

247
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:18,033
These well and strong,
but I have better...

248
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,712
- A real suit, like yours.
- Very handsome, I'm sure.

249
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,749
- And the other one?
- This is... my mystery.

250
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,516
- "This is my secret. "
- "This is my secret. "

251
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:41,196
Well, every man
is entitled to his secrets.

252
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,352
Especially if he has a fine suit.

253
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:10,309
Gracious lady...

254
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,317
Forgive me.

255
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,992
- Thank you.
- Thank you, thank you...

256
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:49,074
I would like, with your accepting,
if you would be pleased...

257
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:54,234
Forgive me.
I should like to walk out with you.

258
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,630
You will?

259
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,952
<i>Mother of Jesus, bless you. </i>

260
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,590
Thank you.

261
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,196
When may I call again?

262
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:22,310
- Sunday is my day.
- Sunday... thank you.

263
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,833
Amy?
Haven't you finished that floor yet?

264
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:46,432
- <i>Thank you, God!</i>
- You bloody lunatic!

265
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,954
Aye aye...
Look who's here.

266
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,874
Does Swaffer know
you're running loose?

267
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:14,273
I tell you, Malcolm, that man
must be some kind of epileptic.

268
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:28,716
The devil take me! Amy, get back in
before the missus comes home!

269
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,839
Well, I never did...

270
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,519
I hope you know what you're doing,
young lady! Do you hear me, Amy?

271
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:48,110
There'll be hell to pay when your
father finds out, you mark my words!

272
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:57,031
- Is your country beautiful?
- Yes. The people's hearts are good.

273
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,598
- This is...
- The sea.

274
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,676
The ancient sea, the dark sea...
The cruel sea.

275
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:35,039
- That's where you came from.
- I remember only blackness, wind.

276
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,909
And the crying of children.

277
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:46,911
It's where all the hearts of earth
that are lost to love and to fear -

278
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:51,312
- lie waiting to be reborn.

279
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,109
This is not Christian...

280
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:58,630
You must be mad yourself, to take up
with a man who's wrong in the head.

281
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,952
If you'd looked into his eyes,
as I have, -

282
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:08,716
- you'd be able to tell that
that man is dangerous.

283
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:14,637
You should listen to Mr. And
Mrs. Smith. They care about you.

284
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,874
- We're the talk of the parish.
- It won't be the first time!

285
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:26,354
- We're the experts, aren't we?
- You're not much of a husband.

286
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:30,911
But you could try to be
a father to your children.

287
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:36,677
- Tell her to stay away from him.
- I can't tell <i>her</i> anything.

288
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:41,231
- I should have chosen your father.
- But I love him!

289
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,188
Go and have your way
with your gypo!

290
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:52,436
Amy... When I was your age I was
foolish too, do you understand?

291
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:57,469
- I was in love.
- You and Father were married late.

292
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:03,749
- I know you were expecting me.
- That madness is treacherous.

293
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:10,109
- It's God's trick upon us women...
- Mary, get her out of my house!

294
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,950
It's none of my business
how you live your life, -

295
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:37,468
- but if I catch you round
my farm again, I'll break your head!

296
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:48,355
And I can't say fairer than that!
