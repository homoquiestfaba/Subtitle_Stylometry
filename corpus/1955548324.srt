1
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,300
What are you worrying about?

2
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,700
It's gonna be great.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,800
Well, what if
stonecipher finds out?

4
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,600
Oh right, lik old
man stoneciphefls

5
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,800
gonna be working late.

6
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,700
That's why he own the
company, remember.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,800
So he doesn't have
to stay after hours.

8
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,500
Besides he'd never pay
himself the overtime.

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,100
What if somebody
tell him larr?

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,300
Look, the only person
in the building that late

11
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,100
is Gus the night watchman, okay.

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,200
I've already worked
everything out with him.

13
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,400
I'm telling you, it's gonna
be the best bachelor party

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,500
that you've seen.

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,400
Don't we have to send
Gary off in style?

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,800
Well yeah but, you know, i
just don't want to lose my job.

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,600
Look, if something goes wrong
i will take all the blame.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,600
"Don't blame Brian,
Mr. stonecipher.

19
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
"I told him if he didn't
take part in the party

20
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,300
"I'd show you these polaroids
of him and this goat.

21
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,600
"Oh yes sir it's a
particularly ugly goat

22
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,200
"but he was very drunk."

23
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,600
I never did it with a goat.

24
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,800
That's because you
could never find one.

25
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,800
Okay, let's make sure we
thought of everything.

26
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,900
Okay?

27
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,800
I've got the strippers ready.

28
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,100
Mike has the booze.

29
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
You have the grass.

30
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,600
Shut up!

31
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,100
Jesus.

32
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,500
Well, howdy officer.

33
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Can we help you sir?

34
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,600
You boys wouldn't be
planning anything illegal,

35
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,900
would you now?

36
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,900
No sir, we would never
do anything illegal.

37
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,100
You just see that you don't.

38
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,800
Yes sir, officer.

39
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,700
You boys stay out
of trouble, you hear?

40
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,000
- Yes sir, officer.
- Yes sir, officer.

41
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,800
Wow, if that's not an
example of inbreeding

42
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,800
I don't know what is.

43
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,100
Damn that cop was weird.

44
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,800
Brian, you really
need to switch

45
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,900
to a decaffeinated buddy,
he's just messing with us.

46
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,900
If he wanted to bust
us he could have.

47
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,400
What do you mean?

48
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
I mean, you have
marijuana in your briefcase.

49
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,100
{y:i}~ shh!

50
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,800
Now, he would not
have known that

51
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,200
had you not told the
entire world, Larry.

52
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Of course he would have.

53
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Cops can smell that
stuff from a mile away.

54
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:45,600
Really?

55
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,100
They take a class in it.

56
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,600
Smelling 101 it's taught
by a German Shepard.

57
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,800
L'm just kidding, chill out,
take a chill pill or something.

58
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,600
Get yourself out of
your hair all right.

59
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,900
I just wanna know why the
hell he was acting that way.

60
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,600
Because he's an
anal retentive cop

61
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,800
who takes his job
way too seriously.

62
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,300
He's gone now just relax, okay.

63
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,200
Larry-

64
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,900
what is it now?

65
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,100
What is this, the
walking police?

66
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,600
I don't think we're speeding.

67
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,200
See that guy over there,
he's going faster than we are

68
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,600
and so is that guy.

69
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,400
If anybody gets pulled
over it'll be him.

70
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,600
Uh-oh illegal u-turn,
oh officer, officer.

71
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,800
Keep it down, i
think it's the same cop

72
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,200
from the donut shop.

73
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,900
Who, officer inbred?

74
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
He's following us.

75
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,100
I don't think so.

76
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,000
He is.

77
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,200
Okay wait a second, let's see.

78
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,500
This is silly, I'll ask him.

79
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,900
No no no.

80
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,000
Hey, officer!

81
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,500
Jesus.

82
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,400
Oh officer
inbred are you following us

83
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,300
because you smell my
friend's illegal doggy bag?

84
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,800
You know, I don't
think that's very funny.

85
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,100
I dumped the pot.

86
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,300
You mailed the dope.

87
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
To who?

88
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,000
I don't know, grandma Moses.

89
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,500
Aw, goddamn, come on let's
go we gotta get a move on.

90
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,900
I can live without the weed,

91
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,100
it's never done
much for me anyway.

92
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
Come on.

93
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,900
Good morning Dolores.

94
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,300
Good morning.

95
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,200
Good morning Dolores.

96
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,200
Good morning.

97
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,900
Hey hey hey, you
all ready for tonight big guy?

98
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,100
Oh yeah, I'm all set.

99
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
I already told Ingrid i
was working late tonight.

100
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,400
(He)', you got the girls?

101
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Oh yes.

102
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,500
We are sending you
off in style partner.

103
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,600
This is great, this is great.

104
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,400
Ingrid darling, I love you.

105
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,300
And in two weeks I'm
gonna be all yours

106
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,900
but for right now there's a
few thing you shouldn't see.

107
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,100
Michael, my man, i
believe you're in charge

108
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,600
of refreshments for tonight's
little get together.

109
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,300
Funny, I don't recall
being given that assignment.

110
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,200
Let me check my files.

111
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,800
Whoa, you think you
got enough there Mike?

112
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,200
You can never
really have enough.

113
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,600
(Ahuds)

114
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,300
Oh yeah.

115
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,800
Larry, it's stonecipher.

116
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,100
Ah, thanks Brian, this is
just the file I was looking for.

117
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
Morning Mr. stonecipher.

118
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,700
Coffee.

119
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
No thanks.

120
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,500
What a nice man.

121
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,200
Yo Tony, are you staying for

122
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,000
Gary's bachelor shindig tonight?

123
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,100
I don't think so.

124
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
I mean I'd like to.

125
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,300
But I sort of had
a prior commitment.

126
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,200
Oh Tony say it isn't so
man, it's gonna be a blast.

127
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,600
We've got strippers,
we've got refreshments

128
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,200
filed under b for booze.

129
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,400
I'd like to but i
gotta do something.

130
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,200
Next time.

131
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,200
Okay, next time
Gary gets married.

132
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,700
Stop it.

133
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,400
You know, we can
still work late tonight.

134
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,300
I don't enjoy
having an audience.

135
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,200
The party's gonna be upstairs.

136
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,700
I mean, we can't do it on
stoneciphers desk like you wanted.

137
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,500
But we can do it down here.

138
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,800
Uh yeah?

139
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
Yeah.

140
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,400
You know, we can make
some interesting copies.

141
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,600
You are so kinky.

142
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
It's a date.

143
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,400
Yeah, do you have
cherry chapstick?

144
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,000
Can I call you back please?

145
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,100
Larry.

146
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,500
Larry, don't look now

147
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,000
but you know that gorgeous
girl from accounting?

148
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
She's right over there.

149
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,500
You know with the niceness.

150
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,500
You're Sharon
Wells from accounting.

151
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,300
And you're Norris the veen
from the land of obnactigon.

152
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,100
Wait a second,
aren't you from Ohio?

153
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,600
I see that my
reputation precedes me.

154
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,300
My friends call me Larry.

155
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,200
Well it's nice to
meet you Lawrence.

156
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,700
May I be so bold as to say

157
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,300
that you look
absolutely lovely today.

158
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,700
Well gee, thanks larr.

159
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,800
That's awfully sweet of you.

160
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,900
Why, you don't look
half bad yourself.

161
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,900
Mike, you idiot, i
was talkin' to Brian.

162
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,400
What are you doing for lunch?

163
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
I thought I'd eat.

164
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,200
Ah, what a
coincidence, me too.

165
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,700
Why don't we do it together?

166
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,700
Well actually Lawrence,
i already have plans today

167
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,700
but why don't you
take Brian here

168
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,400
he does look lovely today,
if I may be so bold.

169
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,800
Excuse me, thank you.

170
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,900
You know you can
act all cool and everything

171
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,200
but you know something?

172
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,300
You're gonna be thinking
about me, I can tell.

173
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Is that so?

174
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,800
Granted, they may
not be nice thoughts

175
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,800
but it's a start.

176
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,600
I'm not gonna let
you forget about me.

177
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,900
I'll take shock
treatments Lawrence.

178
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,000
All right big Tony,
way to go buddy.

179
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,300
Hey, do you mind?

180
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,500
I just need to make one copy.

181
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,600
All right.

182
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Thanks guys.

183
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,400
As you were you
two, have fun huh.

184
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,600
Just, what are
you doing Larry?

185
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,700
Here we are, Wells comma
Sharon accounting third floor

186
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,900
extension 3333.

187
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,400
Just sending our miss
Wells a gentle reminder.

188
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,200
You know, you might
wanna watch yourself Larry.

189
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,100
She's quite the jock
from what I hear.

190
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:34,900
Uh yeah?

191
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Yes.

192
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,500
She's the leading scorer
on the softball team.

193
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
She might break
you in half larr.

194
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,600
Ah, but what a way to go.

195
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,700
Maybe I should
check that number.

196
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:40,900
How are you today
Mr. stonecipher?

197
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,600
Stop kissing my ass.

198
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,600
Oh god, another long
wonderful romantic evening.

199
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,700
- Goodnight Mr. stonecipher.
- Goodnight Mr. stonecipher.

200
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,700
Goodnight Mr. stonecipher.

201
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,600
It's quitting time and
i don't pay any overtime.

202
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,600
Well that's okay
Mr. stonecipher.

203
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,400
We just have a little
work to finish up.

204
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,800
Suit yourselves.

205
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,000
Goddamn assholes.

206
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,300
Brown-nosers.

207
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,500
Come on.

208
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,400
Yeah!

209
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,700
- All right Mikey party time.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

210
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,200
Wait a minute,
let's make sure.

211
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,000
Ladies and gentlemen, Elvis
has left the building.

212
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
Party time, party time!

213
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,900
Larry!

214
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,600
" What is it?

215
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Come take a look at this.

216
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
What, is he coming back?

217
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,600
No, i think it's that cop.

218
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,300
Officer inbred, no way.

219
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,800
Who and what
is an officer inbred?

220
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,800
Just this cop
who hassled us this morning

221
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,800
at the donut shop before work.

222
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,100
And he's down there?

223
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,800
I don't know, where is he?

224
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,100
He's right there.

225
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,600
What that car down there?

226
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,900
What makes you think that
that's officer inbred?

227
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,400
Look, he followed us earlier.

228
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,800
He might have
followed us to work.

229
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,600
Followed you, why?

230
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,400
He didn't follow us.

231
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,400
Brian just has an
overactive imagination.

232
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,400
Some cop car parks behind
us today we we're walking,

233
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,800
right, so Brian decides
that it's the same cop

234
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,600
and he's got some personal
vendetta against us.

235
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,600
So Brian gets so excited that
he takes the grass we had

236
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,200
and he mails it to somebody.

237
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,800
We just don't know who.

238
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,900
That cop was acting really
strange in the donut shop.

239
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Brian, he's a cop.

240
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,200
He shoots at people
for a living.

241
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,500
Chances are he's a little bit
strange just forget about him.

242
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,200
What's he gonna do Brian,
roll down his window,

243
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,600
shake his fist and
shout up at us.

244
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,100
"Hey you kids up there.

245
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,200
"You're having a party
after hours aren't you?

246
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,300
"Okay, come one down we're
gonna take you to jail now."

247
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,500
Now, if you'll excuse me
I'm going to procure us

248
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,700
some feminine entertainment.

249
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,900
Mikey.

250
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,900
Women, women, women, women,

251
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,000
women, women, women!

252
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,000
Yay, women yeah, yeah!

253
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
This is great.

254
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,200
Come on, loosen up will ya?

255
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Come on you guys.

256
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Oh my god.

257
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,400
Holy, check that out Gus,

258
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,700
what do you think huh?

259
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,000
Shame on it.

260
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,900
We are gonna have some
fun tonight, oh yes.

261
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,400
All right, all right,
time to rock and roll.

262
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,200
Hey, thanks Gus.

263
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
No problem.

264
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,500
Just don't burn down the
building on my shift.

265
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,900
All right, yeah.

266
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,000
Are you lovely ladies
ready to party or what?

267
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,000
Oh always ready to party.

268
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,600
We'll see.

269
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,800
Which floor?

270
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,400
To the top of the shaft

271
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,000
oops silly me, now
it's gonna take forever

272
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,800
to get all the way up.

273
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,500
Oh, i wouldn't bet on that.

274
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,700
Are you sure they're only
going to be on the top floor?

275
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Of course baby.

276
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,200
Maybe we should go down
a couple of floors.

277
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,000
Okay

278
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,800
just to be safe.

279
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,200
All right.

280
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,400
Howdy officer.

281
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,800
Can I help you?

282
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,800
Got a call about some
disturbances at this address.

283
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,500
Is everything okay?

284
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,100
Oh sure, everything's fine.

285
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,700
It's been quiet as a graveyard.

286
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Ah, well.

287
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,000
Probably just a crank call.

288
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,400
Sorry to have bothered you.

289
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,000
Ah, no trouble.

290
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,900
Ls that the game?

291
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,800
Oh yeah, it's the
bottom of the ninth.

292
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
Would you mind?

293
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,600
I can't seem to
get it on my radio.

294
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,200
No no no, come on in.

295
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,300
It's time to party
old farts, let's go.

296
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,200
Ride 'em cowboy,
ride 'em baby.

297
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,300
Do it baby, do it.

298
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,000
Oh you are beautiful.

299
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
Oh this is great.

300
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,000
You guys are the
best, I love you.

301
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,600
I love you guys, you
guys are the best.

302
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,100
Mikey, love you man.

303
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,600
Yeah baby, all for
you Gary, all for you.

304
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,000
You know Gus,

305
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,900
I saw you let
those girls in here.

306
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,300
Oh sure, well a couple
of fellas up on seven

307
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,400
are having a bachelor party.

308
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,600
I don't think that would
be in company policy.

309
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,200
Ah, how should I know?

310
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,000
I don't write company policy.

311
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,800
I don't even read it.

312
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,400
Hey, turn that back on.

313
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,500
I for one am sure
that taking bribes

314
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,500
is not in company policy.

315
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,200
What are you talking about?

316
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,400
I saw you take
money from that kid.

317
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,400
Oh.

318
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,200
He owed me a few
dollars, so what?

319
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,400
Now come on, turn that
back on, I'm serious.

320
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,000
Well I'm serious too.

321
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,500
I could run you in
for contributing

322
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,200
to the delinquency of a minor.

323
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,800
What minors?

324
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,800
They're all over 21 up there.

325
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,800
Now Jesus, relax will ya.

326
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,200
They just having some fun.

327
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,400
Fun, fun?

328
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,000
Oh yeah, it's all fun
and games isn't it?

329
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Until someone loses an eye.

330
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,200
I'll be right back.

331
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,300
Why don't you keep an
eye out while I'm gone?

332
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,200
Seventh floor, going up.

333
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,500
Linens, lingerie,

334
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,400
eviscerated women.

335
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,500
Who's that?

336
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,500
Hey man, did somebody
call the elevator?

337
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,700
Larry, none of us were
anywhere near that call button.

338
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,600
So someone called
the elevator, so what?

339
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,000
Can't you see I'm
busy over here?

340
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,700
What if Ingrid found
out about the party?

341
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,300
Hey, if Ingrid
knew about the party

342
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,800
she'd come up herself.

343
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,700
You guys know who it is,
it's Gus the night watchman.

344
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,500
Sure scared the
poop out of me.

345
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Yeah me too.

346
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,200
Very funny Gus!

347
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,400
Now, where were we?

348
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,800
We were right here.

349
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,200
Hey, you know this gag's
getting a little old.

350
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,700
Enough with the
elevators already.

351
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,200
You guys are starting to sound
like a bunch of old women!

352
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,800
I'll go down and talk to the guy

353
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,000
and see what's going on, okay?

354
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,500
Hey, thanks Mikey.

355
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
No problem.

356
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,700
Only, Larry, when I get back
i don't wanna hear no more

357
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,000
about elevators and i
don't wanna hear this guy

358
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,800
crying about his future
ex wife showing up.

359
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,200
We are here to party!

360
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,400
You're not going
anywhere big boy.

361
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,200
Baby, let me go
take care of this

362
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,200
and when I get back we will
have no more distractions.

363
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,000
Hurry back.

364
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Oh god.

365
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,700
Hey Larry, what's
this guy's name again?

366
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,400
His name's Gus.

367
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,400
Gus, okay no problem,
I'll be right back.

368
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,200
And don't do anything
i wouldn't do.

369
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,500
Then again with these
girls I would do anything.

370
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,800
Carry on men.

371
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,000
What if Ingrid finds
out about the party?

372
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,300
Idiots.

373
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,200
Oh.

374
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,100
What the hell is this?

375
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
Oh come on.

376
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,200
Oh that's really funny.

377
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,800
Come on.

378
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,700
I got beautiful babes upstairs.

379
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Fuck.

380
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,600
I really gotta lose some weight.

381
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,500
I think I'll take the stairs.

382
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,500
Yo Gus.

383
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,100
Excuse me.

384
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,800
Excuse me.

385
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,400
Oh, I'm sorry i
didn't hear you come in.

386
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,100
Is everything okay up there?

387
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,700
Yeah everything's fine.

388
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,500
Well one of the guy's
a little paranoid

389
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,500
about his wife finding
out about the party

390
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,300
and they were
wondering if it was you

391
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,100
that sending the
elevator up and down.

392
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,100
Well not me and

393
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,200
I think I'm the
only one down here.

394
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,500
Wait a minute.

395
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,000
Was it the one on the left?

396
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:45,800
Yeah it was.

397
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,600
Well there you go.

398
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,800
See, that one's been
acting screwy all day long.

399
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,800
Those assholes in
maintenance forgot to put an

400
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,600
out of order sign
on every floor.

401
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,900
I hope you didn't try to
come down in that one.

402
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
Yeah well I did and i
got stuck between floors,

403
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,700
I had to crawl my way out.

404
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,500
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

405
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,200
Well just remember that,
try the one on the right

406
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,500
when you go back up
it's working fine.

407
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,500
And don't worry, I'm
gonna get all over

408
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,800
those assholes tomorrow.

409
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,700
I got stuck in there
myself last night.

410
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,400
Oh good, now i
don't feel so bad.

411
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,200
Okay well, thanks a lot
buddy, see you later.

412
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,600
Ah.

413
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,500
How's the party?

414
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,900
Oh the party's great.

415
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,500
Ah, I'm sorry, I didn't ask you.

416
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,900
Can I get you anything?

417
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,700
Whatever you want, we
got blondes, brunettes.

418
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,100
Got any booze?

419
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,000
We got booze.

420
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,600
What's your poison friend?

421
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,400
Scotch.

422
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,800
Scotch, you got it.

423
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,500
Guess you need a
little something

424
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,000
to get you through the night.

425
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,900
It must be pretty boring
the whole night by yourself huh?

426
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,900
Oh no.

427
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,800
I've always been
good at killing time.

428
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,200
Be right back.

429
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,400
Hey, hey Mikey's back.

430
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,700
Where'd you go?

431
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,400
What'd he say?

432
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,200
Go, what'd he say?

433
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,500
It wasn't him.

434
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,400
The left elevator's
all screwed up.

435
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,700
It stopped between floors,

436
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,700
I had to crawl to
the fifth floor.

437
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,200
Brian take a note of that.

438
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,000
Elevator on left bad,
elevator on right good.

439
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,600
I'll type up a memo.

440
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,200
I promised I'd bring him
down a bottle of scotch.

441
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,700
Don't worry baby I'll be back.

442
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,900
Shit.

443
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,100
Sorry, this is a
no stopping zone.

444
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,000
Man, am I glad to see you.

445
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,300
Here.

446
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,400
Thanks.

447
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,100
Going down

448
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,900
straight to hell.

449
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,800
By the way kid,

450
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,900
thanks for the booze but i
never drink when I'm on duty.

451
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,200
Man, Mike should
be here to see this.

452
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,800
Yeah, where is Mike though?

453
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,200
He hasn't been here
for a long time.

454
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,200
He's probably watching
the game with Gus.

455
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,800
Man, does he have his
priorities screwed up.

456
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,200
Mmhm.

457
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,200
Wait a second, Larry.

458
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,200
He might be stuck in
the elevator again.

459
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,100
Then we got a
better boy girl ratio.

460
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,100
I still think we should check.

461
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,800
Brian relax he's just fine.

462
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,600
Larry-

463
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,000
Larry come take a look at this.

464
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,100
What is it now?

465
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,000
That is weird.

466
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,300
Who the hell would be
sending us their chest?

467
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,900
Larry, I think it's that cop.

468
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,000
I doubt if officer inbred
has a fax machine in his car.

469
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,300
His car.

470
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,800
His car's still there.

471
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Oh.

472
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,900
Brian don't hyperventilate okay?

473
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,600
I mean, think about it huh.

474
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,600
Who wears a badge and
coincidentally knows

475
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,200
that we're up here?

476
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,100
Gus the night watchman.

477
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,700
Bingo, give that man a cigar.

478
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
They probably were finishing
that bottle of scotch

479
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,600
and they decided to
mess with your mind.

480
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,800
See, what did I tell ya?

481
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
Look,

482
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,400
you two guys are
too damn serious.

483
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,800
Now, here's what's gonna happen.

484
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,000
Miss Lisa, that's her, and I

485
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,200
are gonna go out and spend
some quality time together.

486
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:29,000
Besides, it's my party and
i can do whatever I want.

487
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,100
Isn't that right?

488
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,300
That's right.

489
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,000
Hey, knock
yourself out big guy.

490
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,600
Brian and I'll take care
of these two lovely ladies.

491
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,400
Well you do that
cause in the mean time

492
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,400
miss Lisa and I, that's
her, we're gonna go out

493
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,500
and spend some
quality time together.

494
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,900
Hey you've already
said that part.

495
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,600
Well, it's my party and
i can do whatever I want.

496
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,800
Take him away,
get him out of here.

497
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,200
You know, I'm beginning
to suspect foreplay.

498
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,500
Oh my god.

499
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,900
Ah.

500
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,400
It's not what it looks like.

501
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,500
Oh.

502
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,500
It doesn't look like
anything really.

503
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,800
She tripped, she fell and
i was trying to help her up.

504
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,500
No, it was my fault
i should have knocked.

505
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,700
I was just looking
for a stapler.

506
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,300
(Anyway, 08")' On-

507
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,800
have a good time.

508
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,900
You know what I mean.

509
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,900
She tripped?

510
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,500
Oh great, the stapler.

511
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,500
Wait, wait.

512
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,600
What?

513
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I got an idea.

514
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,200
What?

515
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,300
Let's go up to the roof.

516
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,300
The roof?

517
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,800
Let's go up to the main roof.

518
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,100
I'm so damn funny.

519
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,400
You're a genius.

520
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,800
Sorry, you startled me.

521
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,700
Well hello there officer.

522
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,600
Very nice night
we're having tonight.

523
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,500
Sure looks pretty out.

524
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,800
You little punk.

525
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,800
You're drunk and disorderly

526
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,600
and we can't have that.

527
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,400
{y:i}, hey»

528
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,400
hey, I may very well
be drunk occifer

529
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,000
but I am not...

530
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:38,100
and what would Ingrid say
if she could see you now.

531
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,500
Ingfld?

532
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,000
You're under arrest.

533
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,600
You have the right
to remain dead.

534
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,100
Anything you say can
and will be considered

535
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,500
extremely strange
because you're dead.

536
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,000
You have the right
to an attorney.

537
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,300
Not a lot of good
it'll do ya because

538
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,800
you're dead.

539
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,800
Do you understand these rights?

540
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,100
Are you even listening to me?

541
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,000
You're not being
very cooperative.

542
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,700
I hate to kick a
man when he's dead

543
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,100
they just don't put
up much of a fight.

544
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,400
Please, put me down.

545
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,900
Well, it is your
first offense.

546
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,600
So maybe I should
just let you go

547
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,400
with a warning.

548
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,600
Oh my god!

549
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,000
You act like trash you
get treated like trash.

550
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,800
Oh my god, oh my god!

551
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,800
What the hell is it now?

552
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,400
I'm pretty sure that I saw
a body fall passed the window.

553
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,500
A body?

554
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:30,100
That's what it
looked like larr.

555
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,800
I don't see any
body down there.

556
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,200
Perhaps it bounced back up.

557
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,900
Listen, I'm pretty sure
that that's what it was.

558
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,800
There goes your overactive
imagination again.

559
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,000
You probably saw a pigeon.

560
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,600
A damn big pigeon.

561
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,200
It was a mutant ninja pigeon.

562
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,100
What about Mike, where's Mike?

563
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,500
Who gives a damn?

564
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,800
Are you actually upset
that we have these

565
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,600
two beautiful
creatures to ourselves?

566
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,300
Well Mike could be stuck in
the elevator again you know.

567
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,500
Perhaps your priorities
are out of whack.

568
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,200
Wait, that could
be Mike right now.

569
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,600
From Gary.

570
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,700
What the hell
does this mean larr?

571
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,200
Maybe he's trying to
tell us not to drive drunk.

572
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,100
Shit for brains.

573
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,600
Well, now we
know where Mike is.

574
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,800
He's down in the copy
room with Gary and Lisa.

575
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,000
Do you feel better now?

576
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,700
Yeah, I guess I do get a
little paranoid sometimes larr.

577
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,700
Yeah, and the pope
is a little catholic.

578
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,900
Hey tell you what, since
we know where they are

579
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,300
why don't you run down there

580
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,300
and we'll really get
this party started?

581
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,700
Okay-

582
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,300
don't be such a nene Brian.

583
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,200
It's okay Brian, okay.

584
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,600
It's okay.

585
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,500
Get a hold of yourself Brian

586
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,600
now you're getting freaked
out by bad rococo art.

587
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,800
Ls everyone decent in there?

588
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,600
Well I guess that's a bit
much to ask from you guys.

589
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,400
Is everyone dressed
in there at least?

590
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,500
Mike.

591
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,900
(Gar)'-

592
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,200
anyone.

593
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,600
Oh, terrific.

594
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,600
Oh, where are you guys now?

595
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,200
Oh, I got a really bad
feeling about this.

596
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:19,900
No.

597
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,200
Hey, welcome back Brian.

598
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,600
Hey, what's wrong?

599
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,800
Hey, are you okay?

600
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:33,600
What's wrong?

601
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,500
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

602
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,200
I feel like I've
just seen a ghost.

603
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,200
Well what's going on,
where's Mike and Gary at?

604
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,200
I don't know but there's
something really wrong.

605
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,600
Really, what is it?

606
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,500
You better come
with me I'll show you.

607
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,700
I don't see anything Brian.

608
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,600
I mean, the place
could definitely

609
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,200
use a little bit of tidying up.

610
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,200
Oh come on, look around.

611
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,700
You notice anything strange?

612
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,600
Hey Mike has freckles, you
know I never noticed that.

613
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,500
I'm serious Larry.

614
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:04,800
Brian I'm sorry.

615
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,200
I don't know what I'm
supposed to be looking for.

616
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,600
How long does it take to
make this many pictures?

617
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,400
I don't know maybe
five or ten minutes.

618
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:13,900
And look at these pictures,

619
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
now does Mike look any
different in any of these?

620
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,100
I don't know.

621
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,900
Is he wearing a funny
hat or something?

622
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,200
He hasn't moved.

623
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,700
Yeah he hasn't moved, he
hasn't moved one muscle.

624
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,200
What are you trying to say?

625
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,600
Yeah what are
you saying Brian?

626
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,600
Look at the pictures,
he looks dead.

627
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:29,900
Oh my god.

628
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,600
Wait a second, you're
getting too excited about this.

629
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,600
Look, I'll show you
how he did it, okay?

630
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Okay, yeah.

631
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,600
What did you do
with my undies?

632
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,600
Tore them off in a fit
of unbridled passion.

633
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
No I mean where
did you put them?

634
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,500
I don't know, were
you wearing any?

635
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,500
Oh no, I remember, you took
them off in the copy room.

636
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,700
Oh yes, I remember now.

637
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,300
Well, will you go
and get them for me?

638
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,600
Why me?

639
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,600
Well because
you're the guy and

640
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:10,900
because you're already
wearing your undies.

641
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,600
All right, all right.

642
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,400
A man's work is never done.

643
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,800
Tony give me my underwear.

644
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,200
Tony give me multiple orgasms.

645
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,600
Work work work.

646
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:24,000
Well, I certainly didn't
hear you complaining.

647
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,100
I didn't say i
didn't love my work.

648
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,100
You know, adultery is still
illegal in a lot of states.

649
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,400
I'll bet that smarts doesn't it?

650
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:42,700
Now, now.

651
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,500
Wouldn't wanna have
to separate you two.

652
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,700
Now that's what I like to see.

653
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,200
You're stuck together
'til the very end.

654
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,100
See.

655
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,900
The grain is different.

656
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:06,900
What?

657
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,500
The grain is different.

658
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,700
When you make a copy of a
copy the grain is different

659
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,800
there's lower resolution.

660
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,100
And look at this,
look at this smear.

661
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,500
What smear?

662
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,800
Right there.

663
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,000
Look, there's
something on the glass.

664
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,500
Oh my god.

665
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,500
And I suppose
I'm imagining that?

666
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,900
It doesn't mean
anything Brian.

667
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,100
It could be strawberry jam.

668
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,600
And it could be blood.

669
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Oh come on, yeah maybe
if somebody got a paper cut

670
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,200
or something.

671
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,000
Come on, reality
check time here.

672
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,800
There are no bodies.

673
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:42,800
If Gary and Mike are
dead then where are they?

674
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,500
Oh give me a break.

675
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,900
This is not Friday the
13th part infinity here.

676
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,000
If there are any bodies in there

677
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,800
they're not gonna
fall out on me.

678
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,200
Then open it!

679
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,300
Okay, I will.

680
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,800
No no wait wait, I'm scared.

681
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,200
Oh come on, this
is ridiculous.

682
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,300
Watch, I'll show you.

683
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,200
Are we satisfied yet?

684
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,800
There is no psychotic murderer

685
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,700
running lose in the building.

686
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,900
Get him off of
me, get him off of me!

687
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,900
Oh my god I was right!

688
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,700
I'm never right
but now I am right!

689
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,100
Get him off of me!

690
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,900
(Grown

691
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,200
{y:i}~ shh!

692
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,300
I think I heard something.

693
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,600
Oh god.

694
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:14,500
Wait!

695
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,900
Here, get in here!

696
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,200
What the hell are
you doing in my...

697
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,400
what the hell
are you doing here?

698
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:39,800
{y:i}~ shh!

699
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,200
I'm working late.

700
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:41,800
Who are they?

701
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,300
And why aren't they dressed?

702
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,900
They're dressed, they're
just dressed scantily.

703
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,800
Oh my god, you scared
the shit out of us!

704
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,500
Well I'm glad i
could return the favor.

705
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,400
What's going on here anyway?

706
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,000
I mean, you look terrible.

707
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,900
I was going um,
how do I say this?

708
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,800
Mike and Gary are dead!

709
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:57,600
What?

710
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:58,900
{y:i}~ shh!

711
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,000
The killer is in the building.

712
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,800
That's what we're doing in here.

713
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,100
We're hiding!

714
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,700
Christ man, Mike
and Gary are dead!

715
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,200
Oh no, oh no no no, wait wait.

716
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:13,000
And the fucking night
watchman Gus is dead.

717
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,000
" Gus?

718
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,300
You remember the
fax with the badge.

719
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,600
Oh shit!

720
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:20,400
What about Lisa?

721
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,700
She was with Gary.

722
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:25,700
We're just gonna have
to hope that she's okay.

723
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,500
Wait a minute, you guys
are serious aren't you?

724
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:27,900
Yes.

725
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:31,000
We found Mike and Gary

726
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,200
in the copy room dead.

727
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,000
I'm calling the cops.

728
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:45,700
It's dead.

729
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,200
Oh big surprise.

730
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,800
That's a big surprise.

731
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,200
Okay, let's not panic.

732
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,600
Let's just stay
quiet, stick together

733
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,000
and get out of the building.

734
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Okay, let's go now!

735
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,500
Oh shit, I almost forgot.

736
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,500
What?

737
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,400
Chloe Wilson and Tony
Michaels are here too.

738
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:58,900
Oh shit.

739
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,200
No no no no,

740
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,700
no Tony had something
important to do tonight.

741
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,800
Yeah, Chloe.

742
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,400
Tony and Chloe are?

743
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,200
You didn't know that?

744
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,000
No, Tony's married.

745
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,200
So is Chloe that's why
they're doing it at the office.

746
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,500
I walked in on them
a while ago upstairs.

747
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:16,800
We have to warn them.

748
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Okay but if we do
that we do it together.

749
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,000
No no no I don't wanna
go upstairs please.

750
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,700
Wait, do you wanna
go downstairs alone?

751
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,300
Can't we just call
them or something?

752
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,000
I mean they must have an
extension or something.

753
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,400
The phone is out remember.

754
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:30,700
Oh god.

755
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,200
Okay, okay okay okay,
let's just go find

756
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,200
Tony and Chloe and get
the hell out of here now.

757
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,600
Okay, let's go.

758
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,000
Wait, wait wait
wait wait wait,

759
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,600
where the hell are we goin'?

760
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,000
I think it was room 10403
or something like that.

761
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,300
Look, I'll lead, watch our back.

762
00:55:58,300 --> 00:55:59,300
Just one floor up, right?

763
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,600
I don't know.

764
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,000
Get your clothes on
guys we're coming in.

765
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,200
Oh my god.

766
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,700
Oh shit, man.

767
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,000
I said it before and
I'm gonna say it again

768
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,500
let's get the hell out of here.

769
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,500
Is everything okay up here?

770
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,500
Oh, thank
god, the police are here.

771
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,900
I never thought I'd be
glad to see this guy again.

772
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,300
Oh, we got a call about a
disturbance at this address.

773
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,100
Disturbance, disturbance!

774
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,500
You can say that again, look!

775
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,300
Oh man.

776
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,100
It's a sick fucking world.

777
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,000
Who were they?

778
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,900
Chloe Wilson
and Tony Michaels.

779
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:58,800
They work here.

780
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,800
I mean, they worked here.

781
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,900
And we found two
bodies in the copy room.

782
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:08,200
Plus, Gus the night
watchman we think.

783
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,700
Well that would explain
why he wasn't at his post

784
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,300
when I came in.

785
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,000
And a friend of
ours is missing.

786
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,300
{y:i}' A qm'?

787
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,400
Yes.

788
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,500
She's probably the one
who called the report in.

789
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,200
She's okay.

790
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,500
Thank god.

791
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,400
Can we get out of here now?

792
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:28,400
Well, we don't know
where he is right now.

793
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:32,600
So the safest place for
your folks is to be with me.

794
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,900
Do we know who's doing this?

795
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,800
Joe vickers.

796
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:39,000
One of the most
twisted psychopaths

797
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,100
we've ever come in contact with.

798
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,100
Notice the pentagram.

799
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,500
Vickers is a Satan worshiper.

800
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,000
Must make him real strong

801
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,400
'cause the last time
we had to deal with him

802
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,700
he got shot six times and
stabbed in the stomach

803
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,500
by a long wooden stake.

804
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,600
And I mean all the way through.

805
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,100
Kinda like your friends here?

806
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,500
And that didn't kill him?

807
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,100
Barely slowed him down.

808
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,800
The kids that did it to him

809
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:07,800
left him for dead
and went for help

810
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:11,800
and when we got there
we couldn't find a body.

811
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,800
We assumed he was dead.

812
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:18,000
'Til the killing started again.

813
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,700
When was that?

814
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,800
Oh, just this evening.

815
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,800
We found the body of your
friend in the dumpster outside.

816
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,900
Our friend?

817
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,300
The brunette.

818
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,000
I'm assuming she's your friend

819
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,400
because all three of
you are dressed a like.

820
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,200
Wait a minute.

821
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,100
I thought you said she was
the one that called this in?

822
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,000
I thought you said she was okay?

823
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:44,900
How the hell should I know?

824
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,500
What have I got crystal balls?

825
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,200
But you said that...

826
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,500
I don't care what I said.

827
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,200
Are you trying to
impede my investigation?

828
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,600
No sir, I just wanna...

829
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,600
shut up!

830
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,600
None of you is above suspicion.

831
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,800
I thought you said it
was this vickers guy.

832
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:05,100
No.

833
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,100
You're confused little lady.

834
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,300
Police officer Joe vickers,

835
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,400
at your service.

836
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,500
Now, where was I?

837
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,500
Oh yeah, I was gonna
show you my scar.

838
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,800
" Now!

839
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,800
The cop's the killer

840
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,500
let's get the hell out of here
while we still have a chance.

841
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:39,400
I shoulda told you, I'll
never take a desk job.

842
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:43,500
No!

843
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:45,700
Larry!

844
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,800
Burn in hell you little nini.

845
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,600
" Go!

846
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,400
Hurry, he's coming.

847
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Oh girls.

848
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,500
What are you running for?

849
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:57,200
I'm just gonna read
ya your rights.

850
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,800
Look out you guys, look out.

851
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,800
Break the glass!

852
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:22,600
- Dammit it's bulletproof.
- Oh god.

853
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:24,300
No.

854
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:30,000
Oh no, oh no.

855
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:40,900
All right, come
get it you asshole.

856
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:49,800
Where is he?

857
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,100
I don't know,
he didn't come out.

858
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,000
How are we gonna
get out of here?

859
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,000
I think there's a
fire exit somewhere.

860
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,400
Where?

861
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,800
I don't know, there's
never been a fire.

862
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:02,800
Oh god.

863
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:03,500
We're gonna have
to go look for it.

864
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,500
We don't know where he is.

865
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,500
I know he's not in the
lobby, I can see the lobby.

866
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:09,900
Did he shoot the guys?

867
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,800
I heard some shots.

868
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,400
I don't know.

869
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:14,900
Oh my god, he's gonna
shot us, he's gonna shot us.

870
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,600
Not if we can get
a way out of here.

871
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,300
I'm going to look
for another exit.

872
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:20,600
You wanna come with me,
you guys wanna stay here?

873
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:21,400
I don't wanna stay here.

874
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:22,800
Me either.

875
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,400
All right, all
right, follow me.

876
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,800
What do we do now?

877
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:29,700
Let me think.

878
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,300
Oh sure, like, take your time.

879
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,700
Shut up Cindy.

880
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,800
We're gonna have to go
back up to the third floor

881
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,300
and try to get out
through the garage.

882
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,400
Terrific, does that mean

883
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,600
we're gonna have
to take the stairs?

884
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,500
That or the elevator.

885
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,700
Personally I think we'll
do better on the stairs.

886
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:43,400
Come on.

887
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:44,700
Let's go.

888
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:48,300
Come on, this way.

889
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,400
What about here?

890
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,300
There's no way to get to
the garage on that floor.

891
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:12,800
How do you know?

892
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:14,100
Trust me.

893
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,500
Drop it.

894
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:22,800
Drop the gun.

895
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,600
Like hell I will.

896
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:25,600
Let her go.

897
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,100
Oh my god.

898
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,600
Now I'll splatter her brains

899
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:31,000
all over this wall if
you don't drop that gun.

900
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,300
Oh my god.

901
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,400
You're repeating
yourself dear.

902
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:39,100
Don't kill me,
please don't kill me.

903
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,600
Look, I'm not
putting this gun down.

904
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,800
You let her go and we'll
let you walk out of here.

905
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,500
You'll let me, will ya?

906
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,000
Oh that's rich.

907
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,600
All right.

908
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:55,200
Just to let you know
that I'm a serious guy.

909
01:03:58,600 --> 01:03:59,900
Cindy!

910
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,700
Now, I will splatter
her brains too

911
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,900
if you don't put the gun down.

912
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,600
But if you do I promise
i won't shoot her.

913
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:12,200
I've already reached
my quota today.

914
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,300
Okay, let her go.

915
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,300
Kick it over here.

916
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,800
Thank you.

917
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,200
Now let her go.

918
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:45,900
You got to listen more
carefully to what people say.

919
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,000
I never said I'd let her go.

920
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:54,400
I only said i
wouldn't shoot her.

921
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,700
How's the party
girls, having fun yet?

922
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Nice chaps.

923
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:29,700
Come out come out
wherever you are.

924
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:41,800
Olly olly oxen free?

925
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,400
You can run, you can't hide.

926
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,200
Ah.

927
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:09,100
Assaulting an officer,
that's a serious offense.

928
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,600
What are you gonna do
now, call the cops?

929
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,300
No, I'm gonna send you back
to hell you twisted shit.

930
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,600
Whoops, silly me.

931
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,600
I forgot to reload.

932
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,000
Oh yes, this is going to be fun.

933
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:02,800
Oh god, I'm gonna
have to do it.

934
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,000
Oh god, oh god.

935
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,400
I'm here.

936
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,800
Ding dong-

937
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,900
avon calling.

938
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,200
Candy gram.

939
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:49,100
Here's Joey.

940
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,900
Come on out, I know
you're in here.

941
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,200
I've got a search warrant.

942
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,200
I'm not gonna hurt ya.

943
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,600
You know, I really think
that we should talk about

944
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,800
all those unpaid
parking tickets.

945
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:44,300
I'm not gonna hurt
you to get even.

946
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,600
Oh no.

947
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:49,500
That would be childish.

948
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:53,700
I'm gonna hurt you just
because it's gonna be fun.

949
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:03,600
Are you waiving your
right to an attorney?

950
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:05,900
What about your phone call?

951
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:08,500
You get one phone
call, you know.

952
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:14,100
No?

953
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,800
Well, whatever you say.

954
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:20,000
She waives her right
to a phone call.

955
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:24,000
Wait a minute.

956
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:27,900
The verdict is in.

957
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Aw, too bad.

958
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,600
It's the death penalty.

959
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:35,800
One Adam 12, one Adam 12.

960
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:40,900
Suspect is blonde and considered
extremely fucking stupid.

961
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:02,800
You know, they just don't make
elevators like they used to.

962
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:04,100
Do they?

963
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,400
You always end up
getting the shaft.

964
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:27,600
All right, this is the police.

965
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,500
Come outwith your hands
where we can see 'em.

966
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,000
Damn, that always works on TV.

967
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:38,300
Ah-ha.

968
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:44,000
Of course, where else would
a lady like yourself be?

969
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,800
You're powdering your nose.

970
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,400
Can't have a shiny nose can we?

971
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,100
Not when I'm gonna
cut your head off

972
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,500
and put it on a goddamn stake

973
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,200
and parade around town with it.

974
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,900
Eat this you gargoyle.

975
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,400
Go back to hell.

976
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,600
Ah shit!

977
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,400
I guess you got the
shaft in the end huh?

978
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,400
Oh god.

979
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:28,800
It's all right, it's okay.

980
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:29,400
I'm sorry.

981
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:31,000
I didn't mean to.

982
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,500
Where is he?

983
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,800
- No, it's okay.
- Where is he?

984
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,400
He's dead I killed
him, it's all right.

985
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,000
- You killed him?
- Oh god, you okay?

986
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,600
- You killed him?
- You're shot.

987
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:41,800
Yes.

988
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:45,100
I'm okay, i
stopped the bleeding.

989
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:46,600
What do you say we get
the hell out of here huh?

990
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:47,800
Yeah, yeah I'm up for that.

991
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,800
I'm so glad you're alive.

992
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,900
Come on, let me help you.

993
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,300
- Wait, lean on me.
- Oh.

994
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,200
- Watch out.
- You okay?

995
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:00,100
Easy, just go slow.

996
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:01,700
All right.

997
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:11,200
Here, oh shit i
completely forgot

998
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:12,500
we can't get out this way.

999
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,000
So it would seem.

1000
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:15,500
You're bleeding again.

1001
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:17,300
Look, we're gonna have to
go up to the third floor

1002
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:17,900
and get out the garage.

1003
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:19,300
You think you're up to it?

1004
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:22,200
After tonight that
would be a cake walk.

1005
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:23,200
I'll get the elevator.

1006
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:24,500
Okay-

1007
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,000
oh shit, I almost forgot,

1008
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,600
the elevator's not
working either we

1009
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:32,700
gotta go up the stairs.

1010
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,200
Nini!

1011
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,200
You, you I wanna kill
with my bare hands.

1012
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:08,200
And it is not gonna be quick.

1013
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,400
Sharon.

1014
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:35,000
Remember what I said about
not holding a grudge.

1015
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:37,100
I lied.

1016
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Sharon.

1017
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,300
It is your turn, come here.

1018
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I see you.

1019
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:23,200
You burned me you bitch.

1020
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,300
Good thing you're wearing black

1021
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,500
'cause you're
going to a funeral.

1022
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:29,800
Yours.

1023
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:00,400
Oh god, please!

1024
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,300
Somebody help me!

1025
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,200
Somebody help me!

1026
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:13,900
Please!

1027
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,600
Somebody!

1028
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,400
Please!

1029
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:24,500
Somebody!

1030
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,600
Please, somebody, help me!

1031
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,000
Please, somebody!

1032
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,400
Please, no!

1033
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:07,400
What the hell's
going on out there?

1034
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,800
Hey, what the hell's
he doing to her?

1035
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,700
Oh my god, that's a cop.

1036
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,500
And he's beating
the shit out of her.

1037
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:25,800
Let's go.

1038
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,500
God, somebody help me!

1039
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:43,100
Stop it, Jesus Christ.

1040
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,700
Hey, leave her alone.

1041
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,300
Hey, cut it out.

1042
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:49,000
Back off asshole, I don't
care what she's done.

1043
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,200
Jesus, you're a mess officer.

1044
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:52,600
Go to hell.

1045
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:56,000
You're all under arrest
for person blocking.

1046
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,000
- Get him!
- Hit him!

1047
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,000
- Hit him!
- Hit him!

1048
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,600
- Hit him!
- Hit him!

1049
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,600
And that was the
scene at approximately

1050
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,800
{y:i}2 A.M. this morning
when a group of citizens

1051
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:45,800
coming to the aid
of a woman in need

1052
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:48,700
unknowingly helped capture
officer Joe vickers.

1053
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,600
Former police officer who
has since gone on to infamy

1054
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:54,700
as one of the southlands most
notorious serial killers.

1055
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,700
Vickers spent most of
the proceeding evening

1056
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,400
terrorizing the occupants
of stonecipher enterprises.

1057
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:01,000
An office building
here on mission

1058
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:02,900
from which there were
only two survivors.

1059
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,700
As for vickers himself,
despite the beating he took,

1060
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,400
he remains in guarded
condition at county hospital.

1061
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:09,800
Doctors are quoted as saying

1062
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:12,500
"his survival is nothing
short of a miracle."

1063
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,500
Will you please
turn that thing off.

1064
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,300
Yeah, I don't wanna
relive that again.

1065
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:20,700
I have a feeling we're
gonna be seeing that video

1066
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:21,900
plenty of times.

1067
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:25,300
So how you feeling anyway?

1068
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,700
Like I've been
shot in the shoulder

1069
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:27,900
and chopped with an ax.

1070
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,500
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1071
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:31,900
You know what I'm
thinking though.

1072
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
'Hmm?

1073
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:35,500
Does workers'
compensation cover this?

1074
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,100
