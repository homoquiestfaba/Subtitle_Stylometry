1
00:00:35,434 --> 00:00:37,732
Quiet on set, please. Quiet down.

2
00:00:37,803 --> 00:00:41,603
<i>Here we go. Pulsara Mágica
testimonial, take 13.</i>

3
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:43,539
- 14.
- Take 14.

4
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:46,169
And 3, 2...

5
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:50,306
Two years ago,
I was working on my roof

6
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,442
when suddenly...

7
00:00:52,518 --> 00:00:53,746
I fell.

8
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:57,653
I hit the floor and hurt my back.

9
00:00:57,723 --> 00:01:01,784
I couldn't find work.
Nobody'd hire me.

10
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,658
But thank God

11
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:06,459
I found The Magic Bracelet.

12
00:01:06,532 --> 00:01:08,261
And since then...

13
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:11,394
- my life has changed...
- Cut! Cut!

14
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,300
We're not selling used cars.

15
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:19,469
We sell hope.

16
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:22,343
I repeat: Hope.

17
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,507
Do it again.

18
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,479
I don't understand.

19
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,184
What don't you understand,
for the love of...

20
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,781
How do you sell hope?

21
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,584
How do I sell hope?

22
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,659
Watch me.

23
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:49,004
If I didn't believe that this bracelet...

24
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,509
worked miracles,

25
00:01:51,577 --> 00:01:54,671
that this bracelet cured arthritis,

26
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,044
I wouldn't use it.

27
00:01:57,216 --> 00:01:59,184
Now you understand?

28
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:02,550
The folks need to believe
what you're selling is real.

29
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,987
That the bracelet is real.

30
00:02:04,056 --> 00:02:04,920
Act.

31
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,519
- You sure you got it?
- Perfectly.

32
00:02:09,595 --> 00:02:11,028
- Sure?
- Sure?

33
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:12,826
But can you explain one thing?

34
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:16,526
What's that?

35
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:19,093
How does this bracelet work?

36
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:25,838
The script says it's going to send
energy all through my body.

37
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:27,811
Truth is I feel nothing.

38
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,543
And me, as a Method actor...

39
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:35,212
- I need to know what I'm feeling...
- What, what?

40
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:37,221
A Method actor?

41
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:39,189
What's your problem?

42
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:41,726
Can't you just say
the words as written?

43
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,092
You think I'm an idiot, or what?

44
00:02:51,837 --> 00:02:53,634
Sorry. My nerves.

45
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,070
You're fired.

46
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,304
Let's give this Method actor
a hand. He's got to go.

47
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:08,848
Get out before I pummel you.

48
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,118
You!

49
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,990
You. The one cleaning.

50
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:18,254
How long have you been
in this country?

51
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,797
Two weeks? Three?

52
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:21,833
Get this man a script.

53
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:26,403
Pelocine...
The hair regrowth tonic for men.

54
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:32,536

more hair than when you were 20.

<i>When I fell, I hurt my back. </i>

81
00:06:22,314 --> 00:06:23,611
Sit down.

82
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:27,011
I wanted to stretch my legs.

83
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,827
It's just, we've been
sitting for hours now.

84
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,192
When someone comes to pay for you,
then you stretch.

85
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,405
Yeah?

86
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:00,479
Which one?

87
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:03,651
Wait here.

88
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,497
You. Nappy-locks. Get out.

89
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:22,970
<i>Reinforced with titanium steel
and coated with crystals... </i>

90
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:27,178
Thank you.

91
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,180
You've been so kind. God bless you.

92
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,045
What's the matter with you,
moron? Get out!

93
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:33,876
Go on! Get out!

94
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,318
Sorry.

95
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,048
Frickin' homo.

96
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,288
I hate this country.

97
00:07:59,244 --> 00:08:00,905
Bro.

98
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,106
How ostentatious.

99
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,205
You like it?

100
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,306
Drug money?

101
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,982
What a racist comment.

102
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:10,249
Just because I'm a well-dressed
Latino with a car

103
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:12,313
doesn't mean I'm a drug dealer.

104
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:15,087
Since we last spoke,
I started my distribution company.

105
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,651
Check it out.

106
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,766
I saw this one. Good movie.
Very, very, very good.

107
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,270
I personally did the artwork.

108
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,705
<i>I think you misspelled Crash. </i>

109
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,076
Business is good, then?

110
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:40,244
Good enough to get you here.
Which reminds me. You owe me.

111
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,014
I owe you for what?

112
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:44,851
For getting you across the border.
Know what that costs these days?

113
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,290
Take what you need from here.

114
00:08:50,629 --> 00:08:52,790
Where'd you get this?

115
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:56,391
From him.

116
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:00,937
Hand it over.

117
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:02,530
I wouldn't give it to him.

118
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,098
The gun's pointed at my head.

119
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:05,700
Still, I wouldn't give it to him.

120
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,006
Of course...

121
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:08,706
because the gun isn't at your head.

122
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,942
Enough chitchat. Give me the wallet.

123
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,664
If I were you guys,
I'd leave before he wakes up.

124
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:37,641
<i>Improve your life. Call nowl</i>

125
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,129
This job's not going to be easy.

126
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,994
I didn't expect otherwise.

127
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:02,324
"ENTREPRENEUR"

128
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,393
- He's doing very well for himself.
- Better than you thought.

129
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,972
How far is his office from here?

130
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,303
Ten minutes.

131
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:23,883
So these immigrants are here
every day, waiting for work?

132
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,253
Yep. Every day.

133
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:29,886
Good. You and Castillo go in
as day laborers like we did in '02.

134
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,827
So when do we hook up with Castillo?

135
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,661
Never. Castillo got married.
Lives the honest life now.

136
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,631
Let's get you out of those rags.

137
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,834
- What about Guzman?
- He's in Mexico.

138
00:10:44,743 --> 00:10:46,142
I thought he was here.

139
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:48,270
He was, until he got deported.

140
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:52,374
Got picked up at a bus stop
in an INS sweep.

141
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:53,918
What about Rodriguez, then?

142
00:10:53,986 --> 00:11:00,391
Please don't tell me he fell in love
and moved to Paris.

143
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,983
No, Rodriguez is still here.

144
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:05,087
What?

145
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:09,294
But he didn't like the 50/50 cut
you proposed.

146
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,268
Greedy friggin' bastard...

147
00:11:14,873 --> 00:11:16,932
He's not alone.

148
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,809
Nobody understands
why you're keeping 50%

149
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,781
when we've always split
the full 100 evenly.

150
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,375
You and I both know this job is different.

151
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:29,746
This one's personal.

152
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:35,892
Besides, we're going after one man,
not some fat corporation like usual.

153
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,828
Son of a bitch! Is there
no honor amongst thieves?

154
00:11:38,897 --> 00:11:40,296
Aside from you and me?

155
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:45,927
What am I doing here?
You said everything was set up.

156
00:11:46,004 --> 00:11:46,936
It is.

157
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:48,905
No, it's not set up.

158
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:52,102
For this job, we need a crew.

159
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:54,577
We can't do this one alone.

160
00:11:56,782 --> 00:12:02,482
What if I told you I had a crew
that was okay with splitting 50/50?

161
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:06,046
Better yet, a crew that nobody knows.

162
00:12:06,124 --> 00:12:07,250
Civilians?

163
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:13,831
Good. Because you know
I never use civilians.

164
00:12:16,835 --> 00:12:18,132
Immigrants.

165
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,171
To hell with this.
I'm going back to Colombia.

166
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,070
Wait, Emilio!

167
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,668
I've scouted a few guys,
each skilled in what we'll need.

168
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,906
We need professionals...

169
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,313
- They are professionals...
- Professional thieves!

170
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:32,680
We'll train them.

171
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:33,615
In two weeks?

172
00:12:33,685 --> 00:12:35,482
Please! Please!

173
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,112
This was your plan anyway!

174
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:41,990
You said it. People here don't
give immigrants a second thought.

175
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,028
Remember?

176
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,064
They're practically invisible:

177
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:48,861
The maid, the chauffeur, the gardener.

178
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,367
Moving in and out
of highly secure places...

179
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:52,926
I know what I said.
I know what I said.

180
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,803
- They go virtually unchecked!
- Exactly!

181
00:12:55,874 --> 00:13:00,470
We were using professional thieves
posing as immigrants.

182
00:13:00,545 --> 00:13:04,641
Except now we're using real immigrants.

183
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,179
We really don't have much of a choice,
Emilio. Other than...

184
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:11,552
calling it off.

185
00:13:24,002 --> 00:13:27,369
So, Alejandro? Is the chapel
going to work for you?

186
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,773
It's your call, Emilio.

187
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:36,075
Do we donate to the parish
or forget this whole damn thing?

188
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:40,585
Donate.

189
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,852
The chapel's perfect, Father.

190
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:48,325
Tell me about these immigrants.

191
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:54,462
For all our technical needs,
we have the perfect guy.

192
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:58,902
His name is Julio Miranda, and he can fix
a computer with a toothpick.

193
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:02,731
Julio, is my camera ready?

194
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,177
What?

195
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,280
I said yes! Yes, bro! It's over there!

196
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,976
And he can mumble
in six languages.

197
00:14:14,953 --> 00:14:18,252
And for transportation,
I have Rafa and Rafaela.

198
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:22,121
Shut up, Fifi.

199
00:14:27,332 --> 00:14:29,095
What's up, Alex?

200
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:34,594
- Is that Rafa?
- No.

201
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:39,601
That's him.

202
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:50,620
Alejandro. What are you doing here?

203
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,249
I'm almost done with your baby.

204
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,656
You like it?

205
00:14:54,726 --> 00:14:56,284
Now, that's a car.

206
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,958
That's why I'm the best.

207
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,693
Are you bringing me new business,
or is this your new lover?

208
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:09,537
Remember that job
I was doing with an old friend?

209
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,877
I've never stolen anything in my life.

210
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,252
And all this?

211
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,987
I ain't done nothing illegal since
I got out of juvie five years ago.

212
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:30,289
I assure you, this is worth it.

213
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,796
All I got to do is drive?

214
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,764
You don't have to decide now.

215
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:37,858
Think about it.

216
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:39,335
If you're up to it...

217
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,268
...meet us here tomorrow at 10 A. M.

218
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:48,107
You need cars customized or fixed?

219
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,648
You gonna need a driver?

220
00:15:50,715 --> 00:15:52,239
Your father?

221
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,413
- She knows what she's doing.
- He's good.

222
00:15:57,622 --> 00:15:59,487
But don't tell her I said that.

223
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,253
But don't tell him I said that.

224
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:06,697
If you convince my dad, I'll do it.
I trust his judgment.

225
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,457
But don't tell him I said that.

226
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,463
Done.

227
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:15,865
Closed.

228
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:27,075
The union strike will
make or break this heist.

229
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:31,782
For that we need a real con man,
not an immigrant.

230
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,424
I got the perfect guy.

231
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,959
His name is Miguelito.
He's a Cuban refugee.

232
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,664
A Cuban refugee?

233
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:43,530
Why do we need a Cuban refugee?

234
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:46,293
He's not just a refugee.

235
00:16:47,138 --> 00:16:48,765
He's an actor.

236
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,469
He was doing counter-revolutionary
plays in Cuba.

237
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:56,503
American baseball players are the best.

238
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:02,785
Cuban baseball players are the best!

239
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,325
That's why they all end up in America.

240
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,892
Mommy!

241
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:18,335
And for all our heavy lifting,
we have Aníbal.

242
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:27,669
The other 50%, who gets it?

243
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,737
- Can't say.
- It's my job.

244
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:33,011
I'm planning it. Financing it.

245
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:34,574
So I get a bigger cut.

246
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:35,915
It's customary.

247
00:17:35,987 --> 00:17:40,253
Not really. I just deserved it
for all the years I've put in.

248
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:43,192
If you're interested,
we'll see ya tomorrow.

249
00:17:51,836 --> 00:17:54,168
Okay. Before we start,

250
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:58,005
my partner Emilio and I want
to thank you all for coming.

251
00:17:58,076 --> 00:18:00,101
Oh, sorry.

252
00:18:00,178 --> 00:18:02,009
Before I forget...

253
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,609
I wanted to give you my headshot
and résumé. Maybe you can...

254
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:08,983
I'll take that.

255
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:14,823
All of you know me
and have an idea of what I do.

256
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:17,828
I've sold you pirated movies,

257
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:21,263
fake I.D. S, Social Security cards.

258
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,259
But really, I go for big jobs.

259
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:30,797
Jobs that make very good money.

260
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:33,771
And when I say very good money...

261
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,849
I mean...

262
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,546
That's a lot of zeros.

263
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,418
...very good money.

264
00:18:45,256 --> 00:18:46,723
Fuckin' balls!

265
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,782
Balls.

266
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,158
Is that how a proper young lady speaks?

267
00:18:51,229 --> 00:18:53,561
I don't know.
I ain't no proper lady.

268
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:56,397
What are you lookin' at?

269
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,494
Pansy-ass poser.

270
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,902
Nobody's looking at you.

271
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:02,701
Oh, so you're not checking me out?

272
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,241
- Is that what you're saying?
- Get over yourself.

273
00:19:06,277 --> 00:19:08,404
Nobody here is checking you out.

274
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,749
Enough! Enough!

275
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,645
This is a serious job.

276
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:17,017
It requires serious planning,
serious conning.

277
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:18,214
Seriously big balls!

278
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:20,757
Big balls. Like these right here, Alex?

279
00:19:31,636 --> 00:19:32,603
Okay.

280
00:19:33,738 --> 00:19:38,641
Our mark is an Argentinean millionaire
who lives in this mansion.

281
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,242
Since the collapse of Argentina's banking
system, most don't believe in banks.

282
00:19:43,314 --> 00:19:47,011
Some have resorted to keeping their
money in personal vaults.

283
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,950
Such is the case with our mark.

284
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:54,117
All his money is in a vault
on this property.

285
00:19:54,926 --> 00:19:56,951
We have a floor plan of the mansion.

286
00:19:57,862 --> 00:20:01,593
Except for one hallway downstairs
leading to the vault.

287
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,197
It's off-limits to everyone.

288
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,296
You need two key cards to open the vault.

289
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,931
Primitivo has one.

290
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,101
The other belongs to our pal, the mark.

291
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,275
The in-house accountant.

292
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:17,644
The accountant's name is Primitivo?

293
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,084
Primitivo? Primate? Like monkey?

294
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:24,713
The poor bastard
is more like a caveman.

295
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,883
He's flanked by two guards
the entire time he's there...

296
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:34,259
from the moment he steps
on the property until he leaves.

297
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:36,300
Wherever he goes, they go.

298
00:20:37,335 --> 00:20:39,769
If he has to go to the bathroom,
they're there.

299
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,738
If one of the guards has to go...

300
00:20:41,806 --> 00:20:43,831
Anyway.

301
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:50,073
Primitivo keeps his card
on him at all times.

302
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:53,681
But our mark isn't as cautious.

303
00:20:57,088 --> 00:20:58,680
At the end of each day,

304
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,193
he places the card in a locked
drawer in his private office.

305
00:21:03,928 --> 00:21:06,226
So to open the vault
at the mansion,

306
00:21:06,297 --> 00:21:09,425
we have to get into that building
and get that card.

307
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:11,732
Which means...

308
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,737
we need to get his keys, too.

309
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:16,535
Where are they? In his pocket.

310
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,805
The problem will be getting
into the building itself.

311
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,711
As you can see, it's high-tech.

312
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,681
State of the art.

313
00:21:24,749 --> 00:21:28,913
Cameras, guards, 24-hour surveillance.

314
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:33,720
Eight months ago, the cleaning crew
tried to unionize, but they failed.

315
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,022
We think it's time they try again.

316
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:38,790
They strike. We pose as scabs

317
00:21:38,863 --> 00:21:41,331
and enter the building.
- Excuse me...

318
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:43,697
Let me get this straight.

319
00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:48,899
Your plan depends on organizing a
strike in two weeks? Here?

320
00:21:48,973 --> 00:21:50,964
Correct.

321
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:54,671
- That's impossible. Rafaela, let's go.
- Of course it's not.

322
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:55,678
Of course it is.

323
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:57,214
I'm out.

324
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,048
This record's already scratched.

325
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:11,621
Moctesuma Valdez.

326
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:17,631
The millionaire Alejandro is talking
about is Moctesuma Valdez.

327
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:28,172
The infomercial guru?

328
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:29,941
I didn't know he was Argentinean.

329
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,083
His real name is Claudio Silvestrini.

330
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:42,415
He changed it to Moctesuma
so he could pander to Latinos.

331
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:44,051
Especially Mexicans.

332
00:22:44,128 --> 00:22:46,926
He's a phony, an opportunist,
and his products are all frauds.

333
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:50,263
Everything about him is a lie,
even his name.

334
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:55,864
He's amassed a fortune preying
on the hopes and dreams of people like us.

335
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,237
Regular people.

336
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,876
Immigrants. Like you. Like me.

337
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:05,112
He knows what he's doing.

338
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:09,176
He targets his customers
at the perfect time. You know when?

339
00:23:10,855 --> 00:23:13,983
When they're most desperate.

340
00:23:15,493 --> 00:23:18,519
How many people, relatives,
friends do we know

341
00:23:18,596 --> 00:23:22,657
that have gone broke ordering these
so-called miracle cures?

342
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,031
Too many, right?

343
00:23:26,237 --> 00:23:28,831
And then there's...

344
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,966
Water of God.

345
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:35,445
<i>And rejuvenate the body's
natural immune system,</i>

346
00:23:35,513 --> 00:23:40,473
<i>helping to prevent
coughs, fever, and diabetes. </i>

347
00:23:40,551 --> 00:23:43,349
The most despicable,

348
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:46,686
the most vile thing he sells.

349
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,786
<i>Doctor, I have an important question. </i>

350
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,354
<i>Cancer? What about cancer?</i>

351
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:59,159
And the most personal one.

352
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:03,833
<i>In many cases,
cancer has been eradicated. </i>

353
00:24:03,908 --> 00:24:08,811
<i>That means for a lot of our viewers
who don't have insurance</i>

354
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,648
<i>to pay for these expensive treatments
that are needed to cure cancer</i>

355
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:20,817
<i>have a much cheaper alternative
with Water of God, right?</i>

356
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:25,295
<i>Exactly. And as a doctor,
I recommend Water of God. </i>

357
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:29,732
<i>There you have it.
Buy Water of God right now. </i>

358
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,894
<i>Live longer. </i>

359
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:36,297
<i>Rejuvenate your immune system. </i>

360
00:25:11,876 --> 00:25:16,609
On principle,
we never steal from our own.

361
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:19,206
But this lowlife deserves it.
He's not a good man.

362
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,718
I know this is risky.

363
00:25:23,988 --> 00:25:25,785
But life is full of risks.

364
00:25:26,724 --> 00:25:31,787
None of you would even be in the U.S.
If you hadn't taken a risk.

365
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,926
So...

366
00:25:38,002 --> 00:25:39,663
are you in?

367
00:25:44,308 --> 00:25:45,741
Good.

368
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:51,575
In two weeks, Valdez will be
throwing himself a party

369
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:54,709
for being named Hispanic
Businessman of the Year.

370
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,049
It's a big deal for him.

371
00:25:58,122 --> 00:26:00,590
Even the Mayor of Los Angeles
will be there,

372
00:26:00,658 --> 00:26:05,652
which means the party
is the perfect opportunity

373
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,962
to create a diversion
and gain access to the mansion.

374
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,163
"TECHNOLOG Y FOR THE NEXT DAY"

375
00:26:13,237 --> 00:26:16,104
Julio.
We're getting started.

376
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,511
If everything goes right,

377
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,170
we should be out by dusk.

378
00:26:22,246 --> 00:26:23,838
Wait a minute.

379
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,748
We're going to rob him
in broad daylight?

380
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:28,012
Yes.

381
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,075
Rafaela.

382
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:34,320
You think you can build a secret
compartment like this

383
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:36,121
in the trunk of a limousine?

384
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:38,355
Frickin' A.

385
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:40,693
Do real women arm wrestle?

386
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,902
I'll take that as a... yes.

387
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:48,997
Remember, the deeper you make it,

388
00:26:49,073 --> 00:26:50,734
the more money we can get out in it.

389
00:26:50,808 --> 00:26:51,797
Cool.

390
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,537
What color do you want the dress?

391
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,346
Dress?
No one said anything about a dress!

392
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,178
It's not just a dress.

393
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,310
It's a formal gown...

394
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:04,755
black.

395
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,281
Why do I have to wear a dress?

396
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,928
Because none of us
would look good in one.

397
00:27:11,996 --> 00:27:14,487
You might look acceptable if you did.

398
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:16,624
You want me to kick your ass?

399
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:21,371
Brother, I know this would be a problem.

400
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,303
It's just for one day.

401
00:27:26,377 --> 00:27:27,867
You can kick his ass later.

402
00:27:27,945 --> 00:27:30,539
Please stay out of it.

403
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:34,551
I'm here to work on cars,
not go to the frickin' Latin Grammys.

404
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,052
You know people
at the Latin Grammys?

405
00:27:39,757 --> 00:27:41,520
I'll take that. Sit down.

406
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:44,555
This here?

407
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,436
What'd he say?

408
00:27:52,503 --> 00:27:58,874
That a secret compartment in the trunk
of a limousine is too obvious.

409
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:00,570
Thanks for the tip.

410
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:07,078
How long a tunnel can you dig
and reinforce in two weeks?

411
00:28:07,151 --> 00:28:09,210
How many people are going
through it at one time?

412
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:10,618
- One.
- One?

413
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:16,753
With 2 X 4 reinforcements
every 6 feet...

414
00:28:16,827 --> 00:28:19,557
If I start today, according
to my calculations,

415
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,188
60 yards, more or less.

416
00:28:21,265 --> 00:28:24,666
It's 65. You'll have to dig fast.

417
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:31,938
2 x 4 reinforcements? Is that strong
enough to hold up the tunnel?

418
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:35,604
With all due respect,
I do this for a living. They'll hold.

419
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,241
Besides, it's not like you're
driving a truck over it.

420
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:40,978
Now, excuse my naiveté,

421
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,486
but how are you planning
on getting me in there?

422
00:28:43,554 --> 00:28:46,955
Oh... that's not a problem.

423
00:28:47,024 --> 00:28:51,757
For two months, Alejandro's
been working on the nanny.

424
00:28:51,829 --> 00:28:53,592
Working on the nanny?

425
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,142
No. She can't answer.

426
00:29:08,212 --> 00:29:09,702
She's a little busy.

427
00:29:11,582 --> 00:29:13,573
It's a good thing she can't hear you.

428
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,053
Son, stop. You're going
to wrinkle my shirt!

429
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:24,518
Yes, Mrs. Valdez?

430
00:29:24,595 --> 00:29:27,496
This little animal is out of control.
Please.

431
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:32,002
Come help. I know it's your day off,
but I don't know what to do.

432
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:33,661
Is he running around in circles, yelling?

433
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:37,265
Yes, he's running, yelling. Please.

434
00:29:37,341 --> 00:29:39,707
Claudito, freeze!

435
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:42,302
Claudito, say you're sorry.

436
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,348
Sorry, Mom.

437
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:45,973
Sorry, Dad.

438
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,014
- Thank you.
- Look at this.

439
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,955
You're welcome.

440
00:30:38,302 --> 00:30:39,564
What were you doing?

441
00:30:40,504 --> 00:30:45,601
It's hot. I checked your air conditioner.
It's broken.

442
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,285
I bet you know someone
who can fix it.

443
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,320
Yep.

444
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,455
It's hot as hell.

445
00:30:59,523 --> 00:31:00,888
You seem nervous.

446
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:04,856
I said you seem nervous.

447
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,260
I'm not nervous.
Why would I be?

448
00:31:08,332 --> 00:31:09,856
Let me tell you something.

449
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:12,198
Guards are like dogs.

450
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:15,500
If they smell fear,
they'll pounce on you.

451
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:20,436
Don't worry about that.
I'm ready to go.

452
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:24,777
I always get like this before a show.
Mild stage jitters.

453
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,977
But when the curtain goes up,
I'm the man!

454
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:31,488
I have over ten years' experience
as a professional actor.

455
00:31:31,555 --> 00:31:34,285
If I screw this up,
I'll accept the consequences.

456
00:31:34,358 --> 00:31:35,723
Ready?

457
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,784
Ready for anything.

458
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:39,762
Hope so.

459
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,922
Here you go.

460
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:46,802
- Thank you.
- For what?

461
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:48,168
For preparing my meals.

462
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,070
Like a good woman should.

463
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,301
What?

464
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:55,175
I didn't make the food for you, blondie.
I'm just doing my job!

465
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:00,448
I need a favor.

466
00:32:01,752 --> 00:32:03,310
I need you to go with them.

467
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:04,512
What for?

468
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:06,522
Every good con needs a distraction.

469
00:32:07,858 --> 00:32:09,348
How is it I'm the distraction?

470
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:12,885
It's just that all women...

471
00:32:12,963 --> 00:32:15,022
are a distraction.

472
00:32:23,774 --> 00:32:25,765
Turn the motor off, chief.

473
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:29,005
Turn the motor off.
It gives me a headache.

474
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:32,107
You here to fix the air conditioning?

475
00:32:37,321 --> 00:32:40,552
Did you hear me?
Are you here to fix the air conditioning?

476
00:32:45,095 --> 00:32:46,289
What's wrong with him?

477
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:55,001
The air conditioning...

478
00:32:55,072 --> 00:32:56,471
is broken.

479
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,666
It's broken?

480
00:33:02,012 --> 00:33:03,001
Ironic, isn't it?

481
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,241
What's that?

482
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,884
The air conditioner is broken...

483
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:10,716
and you guys fix air conditioners.

484
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,380
Get it?

485
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,893
What a sense of humor.

486
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:19,520
Open up the back for me.

487
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:21,861
Huh?

488
00:33:21,932 --> 00:33:24,992
I have to check the van,
or you can't go in. Got it?

489
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,627
Ah, yes. Of course.

490
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,399
How nice of you. Thank you.

491
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:39,375
What a surprise.

492
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,849
Good afternoon, Miss.

493
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:42,943
I'll get down so you can check it out.

494
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,511
Yes, yes. Of course.
I need to check it all out.

495
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:55,020
All right, boys.
All good. Go ahead.

496
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,958
You're not gonna check out the van?

497
00:33:58,035 --> 00:34:00,469
I checked out all I need to, babe.

498
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,974
You checked out my tits
and my ass, ya pig!

499
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,167
Daughter!

500
00:34:06,176 --> 00:34:08,770
Your daughter? Charming girl.

501
00:34:12,182 --> 00:34:13,206
Go ahead.

502
00:34:14,885 --> 00:34:20,152
It's the nanny's quarters,
the AC unit, which is broken.

503
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:22,654
- Go on through.
- Thanks.

504
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:44,174
I can't believe
he didn't check the van.

505
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,682
We could be al Qaeda
for all he knows.

506
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:51,483
I'm only here to drive,
not act. Or talk. Just drive.

507
00:34:51,555 --> 00:34:54,251
I just forgot to do
my relaxation exercises.

508
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:56,820
Your what?

509
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:59,055
My relaxation exercises.

510
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,069
Would you stop that
and give us a hand?

511
00:35:45,976 --> 00:35:47,102
You done?

512
00:35:51,281 --> 00:35:52,976
Ready.

513
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,517
Do you like the glasses?

514
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:55,882
I thought it'd be a nice touch.

515
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:57,716
Helps me get in character.

516
00:35:57,788 --> 00:36:00,052
- Marlon Brando used to say...
- Please...

517
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:05,919
Try to avoid security at all costs.

518
00:36:11,535 --> 00:36:15,164
Excuse me, sir. My name
is Andrés Jesús de la Amistad.

519
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,867
- I'm a representative...
- Excuse me, sir. Sir!

520
00:36:17,941 --> 00:36:21,604
I'm a representative from Local 23.
I wanted to talk to you about...

521
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,239
Sir! Excuse me!

522
00:36:24,314 --> 00:36:27,772
I no came to talk to you,
Mr. Security Guard!

523
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:31,548
I came to talk to this gentleman
about unionizing.

524
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:34,887
As I was saying,
I wanted to talk about unionizing...

525
00:36:38,595 --> 00:36:40,790
- Hey, want to be a tough guy.
- Son of...

526
00:36:40,864 --> 00:36:42,991
I'm watching you!
I am watching you!

527
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,625
Your mama!

528
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,602
These people!

529
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,537
The United States aren't
as pro-union as I thought!

530
00:36:57,781 --> 00:36:59,646
- Stop!
- You can't be in here.

531
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,777
Enough! Oh, God! I've had it with you!

532
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:05,378
Primitivo, I'm sorry.
He got away from me.

533
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:06,582
No problem.

534
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:07,646
Come on, let's go.

535
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,158
Gloria. Wait.

536
00:37:14,364 --> 00:37:16,025
Do you mind?

537
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,372
I wanted to...

538
00:37:27,444 --> 00:37:31,346
I wanted to know if you'd like
to come with me to the party.

539
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:38,481
I can't.

540
00:37:38,555 --> 00:37:40,682
I meant to tell you that...

541
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,623
that I'm going with someone.

542
00:37:45,195 --> 00:37:47,163
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

543
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:50,129
Don't hate me.

544
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:53,532
I could never hate you.

545
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,401
You're so sweet.

546
00:37:56,406 --> 00:37:59,204
Look. I'll make a deal with you.

547
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:01,870
If things don't work out with this guy,

548
00:38:01,945 --> 00:38:04,709
my first date will be with you.

549
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:11,479
Sorry to bother you again.
How do you get out of here?

550
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:14,718
Yes. Go left, right, then left again.

551
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,350
Thanks.

552
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:22,893
And then you were like
"Claudito, Claudito, get out of here!"

553
00:38:24,334 --> 00:38:27,997
You know who dropped all those pictures?
It was so funny.

554
00:38:52,262 --> 00:38:53,524
SUV loaded?

555
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:54,655
It's ready.

556
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:03,399
It's just that...

557
00:39:03,473 --> 00:39:04,770
I have to use the bathroom.

558
00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:07,943
Number 1 or 2?

559
00:39:08,011 --> 00:39:08,978
2.

560
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,849
It's just that...

561
00:39:14,918 --> 00:39:16,681
I'd like to take a shower, too.

562
00:39:16,753 --> 00:39:19,313
You can't go in the house. Go!

563
00:39:19,389 --> 00:39:22,517
I've been in there a while.
I'm starting to reek.

564
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:24,720
You don't smell. You're fine.

565
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,057
Really? You don't smell that?

566
00:39:26,129 --> 00:39:27,687
- You don't smell like anything.
- You sure?

567
00:39:27,764 --> 00:39:28,753
For sure.

568
00:39:42,379 --> 00:39:44,210
You ruined my surprise.

569
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:49,318
I'm going to wash your SUV.

570
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,112
Is it that dirty?

571
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,826
It's full of dirt.

572
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,192
After I jumped with...

573
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,094
If you can give...

574
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,335
José, enough
with the noise, please!

575
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,952
I'm trying to work.
I can't concentrate.

576
00:40:35,565 --> 00:40:37,032
Buy Jose a new leaf blower.

577
00:40:41,805 --> 00:40:42,965
Hi, Gloria!

578
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,601
What does she see in him?

579
00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:50,769
What does who see in who?

580
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:56,344
What does Gloria see in that guy?
Her new boyfriend.

581
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,883
New boyfriend?

582
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,222
I didn't know she had an old one.

583
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:03,657
Good point, sir.

584
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:04,921
He's not to be trusted!

585
00:41:05,495 --> 00:41:06,826
You're not going to be long, right?

586
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:15,029
Give me a minute. I'll be right back.

587
00:41:33,156 --> 00:41:36,421
I didn't realize Gloria had a chauffer.

588
00:41:40,163 --> 00:41:41,425
She doesn't.

589
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:44,397
What are you doing here?

590
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,761
I'm waiting for Gloria.
I'm a friend of hers.

591
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,739
A friend?

592
00:41:50,807 --> 00:41:52,707
What kind of friend?

593
00:41:54,978 --> 00:41:58,778
A best friend? A gay friend? Or...

594
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:03,584
A friend with rights?

595
00:42:03,653 --> 00:42:05,678
Boyfriend.

596
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:06,780
Her boyfriend.

597
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:14,194
What does Gloria's
boyfriend do for a living?

598
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:18,033
My name is Alejandro.
I'm a freelance distributor.

599
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:28,602
A thief...

600
00:42:28,678 --> 00:42:30,305
recognizes another thief.

601
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:40,153
I'm going to ask one last time.

602
00:42:40,223 --> 00:42:41,884
What do you do?

603
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:48,088
I pirate Hollywood movies, sir,
and sell them on the street.

604
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:57,400
You're not planning
on robbing me, are you?

605
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:05,341
Because if you were,
we'd have a serious problem.

606
00:43:05,415 --> 00:43:07,781
No, sir.

607
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:13,312
Honestly, the only thing
you have worth stealing is...

608
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,880
your nanny.

609
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,023
Did you hear him?

610
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,360
He wants to steal Gloria.

611
00:43:25,168 --> 00:43:27,636
Mr. Valdez, what's going on?

612
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:34,338
Why didn't you tell me
you have such a charming boyfriend?

613
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:37,346
Yes. Yes, he is.

614
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,883
A pleasure, Alejandro.

615
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,612
The pleasure's all mine.

616
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:46,747
Hold onto this one. He's a keeper.

617
00:43:46,823 --> 00:43:48,154
Of course, Mr. Valdez.

618
00:43:50,293 --> 00:43:51,487
Good day.

619
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:54,786
Let's go.

620
00:43:58,635 --> 00:44:01,502
He's up to something. Find out what.

621
00:44:01,571 --> 00:44:02,560
Yes, sir.

622
00:44:09,412 --> 00:44:10,936
We're here to pick up...

623
00:44:11,014 --> 00:44:12,675
We're here to pick up the old unit.

624
00:44:12,749 --> 00:44:14,740
Fine. I'll open up.

625
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,513
Yo, bro! You Cuban?

626
00:44:16,586 --> 00:44:18,611
Big time. You?

627
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:21,022
Right off the raft. Whereabouts?

628
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:23,184
I'm from San German.

629
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,955
Sagua La Grande.

630
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,387
I have a cousin there...

631
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:30,058
I'll just open these up for you.
Go ahead.

632
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,799
Man, are these gates slow.

633
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,709
You sure he didn't see you?

634
00:44:45,782 --> 00:44:48,046
I'm positive, boss.

635
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:50,279
Followed him all day.
He is what he says he is.

636
00:44:50,353 --> 00:44:52,116
Sells pirated movies on the street.

637
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:57,660
Rumor is he's got
some strong stuff on his hands.

638
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,194
He's planning something big.

639
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:06,760
That's nasty.

640
00:45:08,738 --> 00:45:10,535
I know, I know. I need a bath.

641
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:13,405
Dude, don't bathe.
You finally smell like a man.

642
00:45:13,476 --> 00:45:15,842
You like it? Come here. Smell it.

643
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:19,214
You two cut it out.

644
00:45:21,818 --> 00:45:23,410
Where's the dirt?

645
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:26,484
The dirt's in the SUV.

646
00:45:36,399 --> 00:45:37,423
Mr. Valdez.

647
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:40,999
It's about your boyfriend.

648
00:45:48,778 --> 00:45:50,177
That one.

649
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,441
Not that one.

650
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:57,813
You can do this. Help me, Lord.

651
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,586
Miss, Miss, wait.

652
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,560
<i>Excuse me. My name is... -</i>

653
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:09,258
I know who you are, sir.
And I know what you want.

654
00:46:09,332 --> 00:46:13,200
Mr. Amistad,
we've been secretly meeting,

655
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:16,535
trying to organize for months.

656
00:46:16,606 --> 00:46:20,372
When Chava gave me your
pamphlet, I saw it as a sign.

657
00:46:20,443 --> 00:46:25,710
I can set up a meeting after work
at this address.

658
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:27,841
Take your stupid flyer, ya bastard!

659
00:46:27,917 --> 00:46:30,147
I want nothing from you! Nothing!

660
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:35,848
"WE LEAVE AT 6:00 PM
WE'RE GOING TO 980 W. 77th ST."

661
00:46:35,925 --> 00:46:37,893
$5.00.

662
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:40,890
How much for this one?

663
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,431
$10.

664
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:46,429
This other one?

665
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:47,936
This one's really good.

666
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:54,076
This is how you make your living?

667
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,736
What are you doing here?

668
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:58,576
When were you planning to tell me?

669
00:46:58,648 --> 00:47:01,139
I was going to. It's hard to explain.

670
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,254
Anything else you haven't told me?

671
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,484
Of course not.

672
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:11,827
I just wanted to see this for myself.

673
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,723
Before I told you it's over.

674
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:18,597
Please, this is harmless.

675
00:47:18,668 --> 00:47:20,033
Answer me this.

676
00:47:21,504 --> 00:47:23,836
Were you going to rob Mr. Valdez?

677
00:47:33,516 --> 00:47:35,006
Do you love me?

678
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,918
Or was all this planned
to get close to him?

679
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:42,458
Friggin' pretty boy. Easy.

680
00:47:42,525 --> 00:47:45,119
A few words of advice:

681
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,628
Get out of town.

682
00:47:46,696 --> 00:47:49,631
If I catch you near the mansion again,

683
00:47:49,699 --> 00:47:51,462
you're gonna have an accident.

684
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:26,032
Miguelito, you're the man.
You're the best.

685
00:48:26,102 --> 00:48:29,071
Who did Hamlet?
Who did Pinocchio?

686
00:48:34,677 --> 00:48:37,669
Um, hello. Hello.

687
00:48:37,747 --> 00:48:40,079
Thank you all for being here.

688
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:44,780
I want to thank Blanca. You came because
of her. Thank you, Blanca.

689
00:48:44,854 --> 00:48:46,754
Yes. You have a question?

690
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:49,189
Yeah, what union are you with?

691
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,990
Your union?

692
00:48:53,062 --> 00:48:56,031
We need to know which union
will be sponsoring us.

693
00:48:56,099 --> 00:49:00,058
Well, that union would be...
SAG.

694
00:49:05,074 --> 00:49:06,803
SAG? What's that?

695
00:49:06,876 --> 00:49:10,676
SAG is... is the Screen Actors Guild.

696
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:19,120
The Screen Actors Guild is the union
for actors. Actors like me...

697
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:22,150
Tom Hanks wants to sponsor us?

698
00:49:24,093 --> 00:49:26,459
Tom Hanks, in person, won't really...

699
00:49:26,529 --> 00:49:28,360
Julia Roberts? Is she in that union?

700
00:49:28,431 --> 00:49:32,390
Yes, Julia, too. All actors belong to...

701
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:36,633
With Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts,
we'll get everyone to strike.

702
00:49:36,706 --> 00:49:40,699
Listen, I think you misunderstood.

703
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:45,908
Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts
will not be with us.

704
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:52,649
We can't win unless Tom Hanks
and Julia Roberts are there picketing.

705
00:49:52,722 --> 00:49:56,158
Management needs to see
big stars supporting us.

706
00:49:56,226 --> 00:49:58,456
If they're not coming, forget it.

707
00:50:00,129 --> 00:50:01,494
Don't say that. Wait. Please!

708
00:50:01,564 --> 00:50:02,997
Shut up!

709
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,634
They may not physically be here.

710
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:15,467
But they're with us in spirit.

711
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:22,849
They share the same passion for justice...

712
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:25,080
equal opportunity,

713
00:50:25,154 --> 00:50:26,246
fair wages...

714
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,920
health insurance.

715
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:35,192
Sure. It'd be easier if they
were striking with us.

716
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:40,696
But when has life been easy
for people like us?

717
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:43,937
We struggle day after day.

718
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:47,534
We work ten times harder
than most people from here.

719
00:50:49,979 --> 00:50:51,970
To have a roof over our heads.

720
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,913
To put food on the table.

721
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:56,483
To feed our children.

722
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:01,323
This is the land of the free.

723
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:05,521
And only together, united as one,

724
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:09,656
will we be able to taste that freedom.

725
00:51:26,115 --> 00:51:27,104
What happened?

726
00:51:27,183 --> 00:51:29,674
What'd I tell you? Listen!

727
00:51:29,752 --> 00:51:32,585
Yes, we can! Yes, we can!

728
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:45,531
He did it. He convinced them to strike.

729
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,968
I told you this guy was good.

730
00:51:48,037 --> 00:51:50,062
Beginner's luck. Let's hope it lasts.

731
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:08,746
What?

732
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:11,889
It's pretty obvious.

733
00:52:11,961 --> 00:52:14,452
- What?
- It's too obvious!

734
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:15,895
Don't push it.

735
00:52:48,264 --> 00:52:52,792
The porta-potties are for the help.
They go over there.

736
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:42,911
I know I'm breaking the Fifth.

737
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:45,710
The Third?

738
00:53:48,357 --> 00:53:51,417
One of Your commandments...

739
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:54,321
again.

740
00:53:56,299 --> 00:54:02,670
But You know
my heart's in the right place.

741
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:03,831
O Lord...

742
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,104
They had that outfit made for you?

743
00:54:08,177 --> 00:54:12,910
I got clothes you could've
borrowed. But whatever.

744
00:54:13,916 --> 00:54:14,940
Ready?

745
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:19,188
I didn't think I'd be so nervous...

746
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:21,917
but yeah. I'm...

747
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:25,728
ready.

748
00:54:35,638 --> 00:54:37,037
My daughter.

749
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:42,676
You look... beautiful.

750
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,283
You look like your mother.

751
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,445
Yeah?

752
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:04,233
Can we get this over with?
I feel like a Barbie doll.

753
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,073
Go over the plans to the mansion
one more time.

754
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:17,635
Good. Everybody knows
what they're doing.

755
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:27,115
Get one with the Chancellor, please.

756
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,454
Thanks. Thanks for coming.
Go on in.

757
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:33,522
Get on the toilet!

758
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:36,759
Get up! Get down!
Get on the toilet!

759
00:55:43,372 --> 00:55:46,864
Oh, crap, crap, crap,
crap, crap, crap.

760
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:02,614
I'm in the middle of an important event.

761
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,853
What do you think?

762
00:56:04,927 --> 00:56:09,455
I should make the mayor wait for
a bunch of whining immigrants?

763
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:14,697
It's your job to prevent these things.

764
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:15,759
Yes, sir.

765
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:20,400
You know what?
Fire them. Fire them now.

766
00:56:20,476 --> 00:56:24,071
We can't do that.
They have a right to strike.

767
00:56:24,146 --> 00:56:27,115
What rights?
What rights are you talking about?

768
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:30,084
They're not Americans.
They're just immigrants.

769
00:56:30,152 --> 00:56:31,642
They have no rights.

770
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:36,624
I want them fired
and replaced immediately.

771
00:56:36,692 --> 00:56:39,058
- Or I'll replace you.
- Yes, sir.

772
00:57:31,747 --> 00:57:33,647
How's it going, brother?

773
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:35,547
How's your day going?
A lot of work, or what?

774
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:38,553
Try not to scratch it.
Car's not mine.

775
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:41,954
I'll take this one.

776
00:57:49,465 --> 00:57:51,160
- There he is.
- Relax.

777
00:58:25,801 --> 00:58:27,632
Colombian.

778
00:58:31,073 --> 00:58:34,270
My old friend, I'm so glad you came.

779
00:58:34,343 --> 00:58:36,607
I wouldn't miss it.

780
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:39,772
Are you going to give me
back my wallet?

781
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:43,680
No. Not until you give me mine.

782
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:52,921
We're still the best.

783
00:58:52,995 --> 00:58:55,190
Yep. The best.

784
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:58,262
Let me introduce you to my date...

785
00:59:03,672 --> 00:59:05,765
Enchanted, Miss.

786
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,032
Same.

787
00:59:09,378 --> 00:59:11,141
Why don't you get us something to drink?

788
00:59:13,315 --> 00:59:14,339
The usual.

789
00:59:15,217 --> 00:59:18,516
Ah, yes. The usual... drinks.

790
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:21,053
I'll go get them.

791
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,190
She's very young.

792
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:29,592
- Let me introduce you to the mayor.
- The mayor?

793
00:59:29,665 --> 00:59:32,463
He's a friend. I pumped a lot
of cash into his campaign.

794
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:34,560
Owes me big, the son of a bitch.

795
00:59:40,242 --> 00:59:42,301
Mr. Mayor, a pleasure.

796
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:44,710
Damn, this Emilio guy is good.

797
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:04,822
Thanks.

798
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:20,948
How hard can this be?

799
01:00:22,184 --> 01:00:25,244
I mean, sure, it's every day
you see a mansion...

800
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:29,621
with an entire floor
dedicated to a private vault.

801
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:31,550
Exactly.

802
01:00:31,627 --> 01:00:33,788
Left... right.

803
01:00:35,097 --> 01:00:37,588
Left here? No, right...

804
01:00:37,666 --> 01:00:39,861
right... left...

805
01:00:50,379 --> 01:00:53,974
Idiot. Idiot. It was a right.

806
01:00:54,049 --> 01:00:55,949
Right. Left.

807
01:01:20,509 --> 01:01:21,498
Yep.

808
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:34,122
You're late.

809
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,819
It's not my fault. It's just that...

810
01:01:37,893 --> 01:01:39,861
Wow.

811
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:42,159
You look...

812
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:44,096
You look incredible.

813
01:01:44,166 --> 01:01:45,690
Really?

814
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:49,101
Yeah, like a woman should.

815
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:52,874
And you smell like a man should.

816
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:56,711
- Really?
- Yes.

817
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:07,585
Shit! My dad!

818
01:02:07,656 --> 01:02:09,055
Where?

819
01:02:09,124 --> 01:02:11,752
- No, the keys. Take them.
- Right. The keys.

820
01:02:11,827 --> 01:02:13,385
Give 'em...

821
01:02:23,472 --> 01:02:25,440
- Here you go.
- Give me... take his.

822
01:02:25,507 --> 01:02:27,304
Hey. What took you so long?

823
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:29,276
Sorry, I ran into a...

824
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:31,404
bit of a distraction.

825
01:02:45,494 --> 01:02:47,155
This one's mine. Thanks.

826
01:02:52,534 --> 01:02:53,933
Okay, who wants to work?

827
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:55,732
Me! Me!

828
01:02:55,804 --> 01:02:57,271
Yeah, you. Come on.

829
01:02:57,339 --> 01:02:58,931
Everybody, follow me.

830
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:01,136
What about Rafa?

831
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:04,373
Don't worry. He's a good driver.
He'll get here.

832
01:03:05,614 --> 01:03:06,672
Move! You son of a...

833
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:18,087
Excellent cigar.

834
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,095
It better be.
They cost me 500 bucks a box.

835
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:25,527
I'm trying to figure out...

836
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:30,061
which of the seven deadly sins
hasn't consumed you, my friend.

837
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,470
Sloth.

838
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:35,670
I'm anything but lazy.
Doesn't go with me.

839
01:03:35,744 --> 01:03:36,733
But greed does.

840
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:48,485
You and I have always held different
philosophies towards stealing.

841
01:03:48,557 --> 01:03:49,854
But in the end,

842
01:03:49,925 --> 01:03:51,017
stealing is stealing.

843
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:54,824
I remember a time when Claudio
Silvestrini had ethics.

844
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:58,526
That! That's why I left the team.

845
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:02,331
The money. It's here.
In this country. It's here...

846
01:04:02,404 --> 01:04:04,201
That money...

847
01:04:04,273 --> 01:04:06,707
you make it robbing
Latinos living here.

848
01:04:08,777 --> 01:04:11,143
The old moralist has arisen.

849
01:04:11,213 --> 01:04:17,118
Ah, yes. The pact: Don't steal
from our own. Please, Emilio.

850
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,518
Sure, I sometimes think
about them,

851
01:04:19,588 --> 01:04:21,453
but when I count my cash...

852
01:04:21,523 --> 01:04:23,252
when I start smelling it,

853
01:04:23,325 --> 01:04:25,293
the thought escapes me. I forget.

854
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:32,064
So much money, and it never
occurred to you to help Catarino.

855
01:04:33,902 --> 01:04:35,733
You knew he was sick.

856
01:04:37,005 --> 01:04:38,336
And that he was dying.

857
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:41,433
Were you counting your money
when the thought escaped you?

858
01:04:43,145 --> 01:04:44,908
I got busy.

859
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:46,948
He taught us all we know
about this business.

860
01:04:47,015 --> 01:04:48,573
Yes. He taught us all we know.

861
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:50,743
Everything, except how to be rich.

862
01:04:50,819 --> 01:04:53,117
To get rich, you can't have a conscience.

863
01:04:53,188 --> 01:04:55,622
You have to steal, lie, cheat.

864
01:04:55,691 --> 01:04:57,454
Whatever it takes to get rich.

865
01:04:57,526 --> 01:05:00,927
- Alone.
- I work better alone. So?

866
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:09,098
You don't expect me to share
all this with two or three...

867
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:12,607
ridiculous thieves? Please.

868
01:05:12,674 --> 01:05:14,437
Don't break my balls, old friend.

869
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:16,410
Don't worry about what I've become.

870
01:05:16,478 --> 01:05:18,378
Enjoy yourself and quit bitching.

871
01:05:22,484 --> 01:05:24,076
Out of our way!

872
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:26,553
- Don't let them through!
- Let them through!

873
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:28,317
I'm gonna call the police!

874
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:34,294
Traitor!

875
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:44,331
The keys!

876
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:48,165
Scab!

877
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:57,011
All right. Let them through
before they call INS.

878
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:37,924
Check this out.

879
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:42,797
What are they doing
in Mr. Valdez' office?

880
01:06:42,865 --> 01:06:44,230
- Did you authorize that?
- No.

881
01:06:44,299 --> 01:06:45,766
You didn't authorize that?

882
01:06:45,834 --> 01:06:48,132
Because that Mr. Valdez
will have our head, all right?

883
01:06:48,203 --> 01:06:49,192
I know.

884
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:51,136
They're not supposed
to be in his office.

885
01:06:51,206 --> 01:06:52,935
There's got to be
an explanation for this.

886
01:06:53,008 --> 01:06:54,498
These dumb immigrants,
they don't know better.

887
01:06:54,576 --> 01:06:56,066
They're just easy
with the whole immigrant...

888
01:06:56,144 --> 01:06:58,305
I'm telling you...
Where did the little one go?

889
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:00,211
Where'd he go?

890
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:02,045
- What?
- What?

891
01:07:02,117 --> 01:07:04,677
What's he doing?
He's looking into the camera.

892
01:07:04,753 --> 01:07:06,277
- Did he...
- Get out of the camera?

893
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:08,653
- Did he just kiss the camera?
- He just kissed the camera.

894
01:07:08,724 --> 01:07:09,986
Oh, no! Come on.

895
01:07:10,058 --> 01:07:11,719
Look what he's doing to the camera.

896
01:07:11,793 --> 01:07:13,351
Looks like he's cleaning it.

897
01:07:13,428 --> 01:07:15,089
Look at that. He's cleaning the camera.
This stupid...

898
01:07:15,163 --> 01:07:16,721
- Come on, man.
- I can't believe this.

899
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:17,958
That idiot broke the camera!

900
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,164
I'll look for the key card.

901
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:25,801
You download
the customer list. Hurry.

902
01:07:58,206 --> 01:08:00,037
"CUSTOMER LIST"

903
01:08:00,108 --> 01:08:02,668
"DOWNLOADING"

904
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:27,229
All right, come on, man.

905
01:08:27,302 --> 01:08:28,860
Hell, siesta time. Get going.

906
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:47,121
What's going on here?

907
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:49,680
Did you break the camera?

908
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:53,558
Hey. Stop. Knock it off.
Good-bye. Not clean now.

909
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,961
Look. Hey.
He break the camera?

910
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:57,293
What?

911
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:58,856
What are you doing?
You're not supposed to clean...

912
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:01,334
You got to get out...
Not supposed to be here.

913
01:09:01,403 --> 01:09:02,734
Thank you.

914
01:09:02,804 --> 01:09:05,932
You need to get out of here.
You're not supposed to be here.

915
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:08,203
- Let's go.
- Excuse me.

916
01:09:08,276 --> 01:09:09,971
Come on now. No more cleaning.

917
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:11,603
Put it in the trash.

918
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,580
I don't know
what you're doing with that.

919
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:16,243
Get out of here. Come on now.
Move it. Let's go.

920
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:19,344
No more cleaning. Yeah.
Right there in the trash.

921
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:21,889
Let's get going. I haven't had
my dinner break. Come on!

922
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:23,857
I'm going to turn someone
into a piñata.

923
01:09:23,925 --> 01:09:24,983
Let's get out of here. Come on.

924
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:27,551
Come on, get going.
Let's move it, all right?

925
01:09:27,629 --> 01:09:29,256
You're not supposed to be here.

926
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:31,128
Yeah, that means move, move, move.

927
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:33,429
Move. Come on.

928
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:34,730
Jeez.

929
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:37,897
And learn the frickin' language
when you get a chance, you know?

930
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:45,810
Excuse me, sir?

931
01:09:47,282 --> 01:09:51,343
You're in America.
Learn Spanish, A-hole.

932
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:52,853
Hey.

933
01:09:57,959 --> 01:09:58,983
What?

934
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:01,188
Oh, great!

935
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:02,924
You left the cart!

936
01:10:02,998 --> 01:10:04,625
...will never be defeated!

937
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:08,033
People united
will never be defeated!

938
01:10:37,632 --> 01:10:39,224
We're going to go to the bathroom.

939
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:00,851
They should be here by now.

940
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:03,786
More water, sir?

941
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:09,655
Yes. Please.

942
01:11:14,269 --> 01:11:15,736
Refill that.

943
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:20,532
Yes, of course.

944
01:11:36,024 --> 01:11:37,116
Sorry, Emilio!

945
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:42,190
Do you know this waiter?

946
01:11:46,902 --> 01:11:50,429
Why would he know me,
the great Emilio?

947
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:57,208
He's one of the biggest producers
in all of Mexico.

948
01:11:57,279 --> 01:12:01,113
<i>Listen, Two Women, One Bedroom
was the bomb!</i>

949
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:07,649
Forgive me. I got a little nervous.
I'm an actor,

950
01:12:07,722 --> 01:12:10,885
and I wanted to give you
my headshot.

951
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:17,327
Please, pardon me. Excuse me.

952
01:12:18,733 --> 01:12:21,395
Emilio Flores?
Who'd he confuse you for?

953
01:12:21,469 --> 01:12:24,597
I don't know.
I don't watch telenovelas.

954
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:28,404
Me, neither. Excuse me.

955
01:12:57,873 --> 01:13:02,071
Imbecile. Caressing her back.

956
01:13:02,143 --> 01:13:03,906
Jealous?

957
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:07,415
Yes, Julio, yes! Of course I'm jealous.

958
01:13:25,967 --> 01:13:27,832
This is where the party's at, right?

959
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:29,063
Yes, sir.

960
01:13:33,141 --> 01:13:36,804
<i>Perimeter breach. Main gate.
It's that Alejandro guy. </i>

961
01:13:37,712 --> 01:13:43,776
Dear friends, thank you for sharing
in this wonderful event with me.

962
01:13:43,852 --> 01:13:48,448
I want to thank the mayor,
Councilman Petrovski,

963
01:13:48,523 --> 01:13:54,086
and of course, my lovely wife Veronica,
who, thanks to her,

964
01:13:54,162 --> 01:13:57,757
this whole marvelous
event was organized.

965
01:13:57,832 --> 01:13:59,493
And...

966
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:05,164
Get your hands off her,
or I'll rip your head off.

967
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,571
She doesn't want to talk to you!

968
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:15,072
Don't make things
more difficult, pretty boy.

969
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:16,139
Come with me.

970
01:14:16,217 --> 01:14:21,245
Apparently, somebody didn't
like the arugula. Don't worry.

971
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:26,861
Please... please... don't get up.

972
01:14:29,764 --> 01:14:31,823
This will all be over in a moment.

973
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:43,869
Code Red.

974
01:14:43,945 --> 01:14:46,038
<i>All hands requested
on the back lawn nowl</i>

975
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:47,706
<i>That means everybody. Nowl</i>

976
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:51,736
Somebody get that animal down
from there! He's ruining my party!

977
01:16:24,612 --> 01:16:26,341
Listen, child...

978
01:16:26,414 --> 01:16:30,316
go play outside, and don't
come in here for anything.

979
01:16:30,385 --> 01:16:31,374
Get going.

980
01:16:38,793 --> 01:16:40,260
"ENTREPRENEUR OF THE YEAR'

981
01:16:46,367 --> 01:16:47,299
Stand him up.

982
01:17:03,551 --> 01:17:07,419
- Mocte, enough. Stop.
- Vero, get out of here.

983
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:13,291
My love, remember, you're
Man of the Year. People are watching.

984
01:17:13,361 --> 01:17:16,694
If you're gong to pummel
this son of a bitch,

985
01:17:16,764 --> 01:17:19,358
at the very least take him out back.

986
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:21,265
Go on.

987
01:17:29,577 --> 01:17:31,943
What are you two doing here?

988
01:17:33,214 --> 01:17:35,045
This guy said they called a code red.

989
01:17:35,116 --> 01:17:37,311
Nobody called a code red.

990
01:17:39,487 --> 01:17:41,887
Who's guarding the vault?

991
01:17:48,563 --> 01:17:50,190
Where's Primitivo?

992
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:55,159
He's an animal, Gloria.

993
01:17:55,236 --> 01:17:57,704
You deserve somebody
better than him.

994
01:17:59,908 --> 01:18:02,069
Thanks, Primitivo.

995
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:05,572
You're a good friend.

996
01:18:07,582 --> 01:18:13,248
I want to be more than a friend, Gloria.
Please, allow me this.

997
01:18:16,157 --> 01:18:18,625
I only see you as a friend!

998
01:18:28,703 --> 01:18:31,263
You're going to see me
as more than a friend!

999
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:33,534
No! Leave me alone!

1000
01:18:38,446 --> 01:18:39,538
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

1001
01:18:41,549 --> 01:18:44,712
<i>This is an emergency.
Do you have your vault key card?</i>

1002
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:46,651
<i>Check to see if you still have it. </i>

1003
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:50,520
Yes, I still have it. It's right here.

1004
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:53,493
<i>Come to the vault, right nowl</i>

1005
01:18:53,561 --> 01:18:54,653
What's wrong?

1006
01:18:54,729 --> 01:18:56,993
<i>Just come to the vault, you moronl</i>

1007
01:19:11,512 --> 01:19:14,140
That was it. There's no more.
Get out of here.

1008
01:19:54,455 --> 01:19:55,444
Excuse me.

1009
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:58,448
Yeah, yeah.

1010
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,233
What's wrong?

1011
01:20:08,903 --> 01:20:10,268
Where were you?

1012
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:11,600
Give me the key!

1013
01:20:16,811 --> 01:20:19,644
This isn't the key, you stupid idiot!

1014
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:21,978
"DIAMOND HOTEL"

1015
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:25,713
Tell the guards outside to check
everyone that's leaving!

1016
01:20:25,787 --> 01:20:29,188
If someone got into that vault,
they're not taking my money from here.

1017
01:20:29,257 --> 01:20:31,521
Got that? Move, damn it!

1018
01:20:31,592 --> 01:20:34,254
Get me the code to open
that door! Go!

1019
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:36,957
- I don't understand what's happening.
- I'm being robbed, you idiot!

1020
01:20:39,133 --> 01:20:40,725
Get this garbage out of here!

1021
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:42,133
Lock him in the bathroom.

1022
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:22,200
How much longer, damn it?

1023
01:21:22,276 --> 01:21:23,265
Two minutes.

1024
01:21:26,647 --> 01:21:28,638
It's about time, brother.

1025
01:21:28,716 --> 01:21:32,208
That hurt. You didn't tell me
he hits so hard.

1026
01:21:32,286 --> 01:21:34,015
Aw, crap. I thought I mentioned it.

1027
01:21:34,088 --> 01:21:37,023
No, you didn't. You'll have to pay
worker's comp.

1028
01:21:37,091 --> 01:21:38,080
Yeah.

1029
01:21:45,466 --> 01:21:46,728
What's going on here?

1030
01:21:50,605 --> 01:21:51,867
Nothing, baby.

1031
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:56,005
Everything's going according to plan.

1032
01:21:57,545 --> 01:21:59,911
Meet Dora, Alejandro's wife.

1033
01:22:01,716 --> 01:22:05,174
How do you think we got the map?

1034
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:06,948
Go scare Primitivo.

1035
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:15,993
Sorry to bother you again.
How do you get out of here?

1036
01:23:08,516 --> 01:23:10,484
Where are you going?

1037
01:23:10,551 --> 01:23:14,078
I'm leaving.
Your party was kind of a bust.

1038
01:23:15,189 --> 01:23:16,713
Oh, yeah?

1039
01:23:17,558 --> 01:23:20,322
Check this vehicle. There's bound
to be a secret compartment.

1040
01:23:20,394 --> 01:23:22,021
That's what I'd do.

1041
01:23:22,096 --> 01:23:23,723
What are you talking about?

1042
01:23:23,798 --> 01:23:26,358
Assuring my money
doesn't leave the property.

1043
01:23:26,434 --> 01:23:28,402
What are you doing?

1044
01:23:28,469 --> 01:23:30,334
Don't play dumb.

1045
01:23:30,404 --> 01:23:32,895
Please, it insults me.

1046
01:23:35,009 --> 01:23:37,341
The waiter/actor.

1047
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:41,209
This cheap-looking driver.

1048
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:44,413
And of course...

1049
01:23:44,485 --> 01:23:47,010
Of course! The guy that sells
pirated movies on the street.

1050
01:23:47,088 --> 01:23:48,214
He's a friend of yours.

1051
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:49,620
He was the diversion.

1052
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:52,022
While you were doing
all the dirty work,

1053
01:23:52,093 --> 01:23:54,084
he was the sleight-of-hand.

1054
01:23:54,161 --> 01:23:55,560
Perfect.

1055
01:23:55,630 --> 01:24:01,591
Perfect. Classic Catarino play.
Well done.

1056
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:03,432
Boss...

1057
01:24:03,504 --> 01:24:04,630
we've found something.

1058
01:24:12,013 --> 01:24:13,002
Open it.

1059
01:24:18,886 --> 01:24:19,978
What's going on here?

1060
01:24:20,054 --> 01:24:21,282
It's clean, boss. Nothing.

1061
01:24:25,693 --> 01:24:29,459
Check this car again. Inch by inch!

1062
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:32,055
But, boss, the car is clean.

1063
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:35,398
I told you to check it again,
you moron!

1064
01:24:35,469 --> 01:24:39,701
Wrath. Another deadly sin.

1065
01:24:39,774 --> 01:24:42,709
You won't get away with this.

1066
01:24:42,777 --> 01:24:45,302
You may have gotten
the money out of the vault,

1067
01:24:45,379 --> 01:24:48,109
but you won't get it off my property.

1068
01:24:49,183 --> 01:24:50,616
And another thing.

1069
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:52,380
Your friend?

1070
01:24:52,453 --> 01:24:53,477
He's a dead man.

1071
01:24:53,554 --> 01:24:56,455
Honestly...

1072
01:24:56,524 --> 01:25:00,426
I have no idea what the hell
you're talking about.

1073
01:25:01,996 --> 01:25:03,293
Boss.

1074
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:06,332
The car is clean.

1075
01:25:15,109 --> 01:25:16,440
Please excuse me.

1076
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:30,623
Should we let him go, boss?

1077
01:25:49,043 --> 01:25:51,170
The whole limo, okay?

1078
01:26:00,921 --> 01:26:03,788
It was too obvious, eh? Too obvious!

1079
01:26:35,322 --> 01:26:36,584
Help me.

1080
01:26:41,595 --> 01:26:42,960
Damn.

1081
01:26:44,632 --> 01:26:46,065
Damn.

1082
01:26:46,133 --> 01:26:49,261
You! Get in there!
See where that goes!

1083
01:26:49,336 --> 01:26:51,133
- You got a radio?
- Yes, boss.

1084
01:26:55,609 --> 01:26:58,009
Do it again. Do it again.

1085
01:26:58,079 --> 01:26:59,512
Go find your mother.

1086
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:04,844
- Check this vehicle. Gloria!
- Yes, sir.

1087
01:27:17,898 --> 01:27:20,560
I found some bags in Gloria's SUV.

1088
01:27:20,634 --> 01:27:21,794
Of money?

1089
01:27:21,869 --> 01:27:22,858
No, sir. Dirt.

1090
01:27:29,910 --> 01:27:33,744
Booth guard! Don't let Gloria
leave. Detain her...

1091
01:27:34,582 --> 01:27:36,413
Yes, don't let Gloria leave.

1092
01:27:36,484 --> 01:27:37,712
Copy that.

1093
01:28:00,808 --> 01:28:04,710
My money has to still be on the property.
It couldn't have been taken.

1094
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:07,441
We checked every car before it left.

1095
01:28:16,724 --> 01:28:18,191
Thanks, Cuz.

1096
01:28:22,930 --> 01:28:27,094
Good-bye! Good-bye!
Good-bye!

1097
01:28:45,319 --> 01:28:48,049
7,892.

1098
01:28:50,357 --> 01:28:54,054
2,934.

1099
01:28:56,197 --> 01:29:00,099
2,458.

1100
01:29:02,203 --> 01:29:04,068
7,450.

1101
01:29:04,138 --> 01:29:06,299
That's what you wanted
your money for?

1102
01:29:06,373 --> 01:29:07,499
To give it back.

1103
01:29:20,754 --> 01:29:22,813
9,211.

1104
01:29:54,655 --> 01:29:56,213
Thank you, Emilio.

1105
01:29:56,290 --> 01:29:58,383
But you don't have to do this.

1106
01:29:58,459 --> 01:30:02,054
Catarino and I were like brothers.

1107
01:30:02,129 --> 01:30:04,188
He would've have done the same for me.

1108
01:30:07,001 --> 01:30:09,060
Your father would've been
proud of you.

1109
01:30:11,906 --> 01:30:12,895
Thanks.

1110
01:30:35,796 --> 01:30:37,661
<i>We now go live to Los Angeles,</i>

1111
01:30:37,731 --> 01:30:41,132

1116
01:31:07,394 --> 01:31:09,589
What are we doing here?

1117
01:31:09,663 --> 01:31:11,756
Wouldn't you like to leave driving?

1118
01:31:11,832 --> 01:31:13,163
Driving?

1119
01:31:13,233 --> 01:31:14,359
In that.

1120
01:31:15,602 --> 01:31:17,069
It's a gift from both of us.

1121
01:31:18,806 --> 01:31:20,671
You did a good thing.

1122
01:31:20,741 --> 01:31:21,730
You deserve it.

1123
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:33,548
We got lucky.

1124
01:31:35,556 --> 01:31:37,251
It wasn't luck.

1125
01:31:37,324 --> 01:31:40,350
They knew what they were doing.

1126
01:31:40,427 --> 01:31:42,019
They're pros.

1127
01:31:42,096 --> 01:31:44,929
I never told you how I picked them, right?

1128
01:31:47,468 --> 01:31:50,028
According to the movies I sold them.

1129
01:31:50,104 --> 01:31:53,801
They all liked the ones where
thieves triumph at the end.

1130
01:32:01,015 --> 01:32:02,448
Have a good trip.

1131
