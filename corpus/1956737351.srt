Zoey doesn't know yet--
don't want to get her hopes up.

Over this?

38
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:32,620
Who's your realtor--
Herman munster?

39
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:34,970
Well,
it's a better neighbourhood,

40
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:37,189
and a better school
for Zoey.

41
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:39,670
You might improve the picture
with a man in there.

Yeah, that's all I need

You know,
if it has tires or testosterone,

44
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,202
it's trouble.

00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:51,987
You got that right.

46
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,337
What did the credit union
say about a down payment?

47

About ten thou.

Well... if it isn't

51
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:07,219
our fearless leader
himself.

52
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:10,048
The man goes through more women
than a manicurist.

53
00:05:11,746 --> 00:05:14,052
Now, tell me
you'd kick a specimen

54
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:16,316

55
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:19,362
Nah, he's not my type.

56
00:05:19,406 --> 00:05:21,233
Too cute or too rich?

57
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:23,323
Too perfect.

58
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:24,802
Besides--

59
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:26,587
I'm not looking.

60
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,546

00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:37,249
You're kidding me!

62
00:05:37,293 --> 00:05:39,904
She tells you after
you spent the weekend together?

63
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:42,733
Can you believe it?You must've felt
so used.

64
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:46,389
Did you meet
the wee monsters?
No, they're
with her ex.

65
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:49,087
So, you told her
you don't date women with kids.

66
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:52,090
You don't do the crime,
you don't do the time, sammyboy.

00:05:52,134 --> 00:05:54,397
If this deal
goes through,

68
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:57,400
how many employees
are we gonna need to keep on?

69
00:05:57,444 --> 00:05:59,228
40... 50?

70
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:01,230
More like 20,
maybe even 15.

71
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:04,233
Everything but final assembly
will be done in Mexico.

72
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:06,235
That's a lot of layoffs.

73
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:08,672
Don't see people,
see dollar signs.

74
00:06:08,716 --> 00:06:11,066
That's what
your old man would do.

75
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:14,069
Well, at least they'll get
severance pay and unemployment.

76
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:15,549
Oh, yeah, absolutely!

77
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:17,899
Hell, I wish
someone'd pay me

78
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:20,249
to sit around at home
and do nothing.

79
00:06:23,731 --> 00:06:27,038
Ha!
7-2, buddy.

80
00:06:27,082 --> 00:06:29,519
Sam, women
are like peaches.

81
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:31,913
Great-looking
on the outside, boy,

82
00:06:31,956 --> 00:06:34,176
all pink, smooth
and ripe.

83
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:36,744
But on the inside,
brown and ugly

84
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:38,876
and rotten!

85
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,791
Joanne dumped you, huh?

86
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:44,926
Like a bucket
of dirty water.

87
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:46,493
8-2.

88
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:48,190
Miss Russell?

89
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:50,410
You have
a telephone call.

90
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:55,458
Hello?

91
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:57,460
Yeah...

92
00:06:57,504 --> 00:07:00,463
Mmm-hmm,
this is Zoey's mother.

93
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:02,552
She did what?

94
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,079
Why do I even bother
to play this game?

95
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:15,391
Hello?

96
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,045
Yeah, just a second...

97
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:18,699
It's for you.

98
00:07:18,742 --> 00:07:20,396
Field.

99
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,398
Great, put him on.

Senor del campo--
great to hear from you, sir.

nothing but wonderful things

102
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:29,927
about your meeting
with Mr. Herbert.

103
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:32,452
I'm looking forward
to meeting you myself.

104
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:34,279
You're coming here?

105
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:36,107
No, that's terrific.

106
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:38,588
In fact, I insist
you be my guest.

107
00:07:38,632 --> 00:07:40,198
My family?

108
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:42,026
What family?

109
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,464
Javier--
it's Dave here.

110
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:46,509
Well, how are you?

111
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:49,164
I can't wait
to see you again.

112
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:52,646
Well, great-- I'll have a limo
waiting for you at the airport.

113
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,735
Terrific...

114
00:07:54,778 --> 00:07:57,607
Senor field's family is looking
forward to meeting you too, sir.

115
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:59,348
Okay, great.

116
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:02,177
Well, adios--
or, hasta Las Vegas!

117
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,092
Okay, bye bye!

118
00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:06,877
What family?...

119
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:09,314
When I got back
from Mexico,

120
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:12,230
I told you I had to Polish
your image a little bit.

121
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:14,232
By giving me a family?

122
00:08:14,276 --> 00:08:16,887
Sam, wake up--
smell the cafe con leche.

123
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:19,890
This Javier del campo guy
is real old country.

124
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:22,414
He only wants
to do business

125
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:25,896
with solid family men with
old-fashioned values, comprende?

126
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,899
Fine, so--hey, you should
be thanking me, buddy.

127
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:31,249
I saved
a $50 million deal!

128
00:08:31,293 --> 00:08:34,557
What happens when del campo
wants to meet the field familia?

129
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:37,299
No problem-- he's only coming
for a couple days

130
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:40,171
and uncle Dave's
got that all taken care of.

131
00:08:40,215 --> 00:08:41,608
Oh, no...

132
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:48,353
I'm sorry, mommy.

133
00:08:48,397 --> 00:08:51,356
They had to call me
away from work for this.

134
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,011
Do you know
what that costs?

135
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:57,362
How could you put that...
Thatin Mrs. Travis's desk

136
00:08:57,406 --> 00:09:00,496
when you know
she's afraid of animals?

137
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,978
No one's scared
of whiskers.

138
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:05,980
Mrs. Travis was.

139
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:08,330
And who
told the principal

140
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:12,290
that her father was gone on
some secret government mission?

141
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:14,118
Zoey...

142
00:09:14,162 --> 00:09:17,469
Zoey, you've got to stop
making up these stories, honey.

143
00:09:17,513 --> 00:09:20,472
It was better
when daddy was here.

144
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:22,474
Well, he's not here.

145
00:09:22,518 --> 00:09:25,608
And we have to accept
that he may not come back!

146
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:30,395
Zoey...

147
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:34,269
Zoey, don't do this!

148
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:36,271
Zoey!

149
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:38,708
Zoey!

150
00:09:38,752 --> 00:09:40,492
Zoey?

151
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:44,061
Someone in this family
doesn't want

152
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:45,889
her Christmas presents.

153
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,678
Zoey Russell,

154
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:54,724
get down this instant!

155
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:57,074
Thanks, Bridget.

156
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:59,337
I'll be back at 5:00.

157
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:02,602
If angels
are really invisible,

158
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:05,343
how do you know
if one's there?

159
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:08,825
When you hear music
and there isn't any,

160
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:11,175
an angel's there.

161
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:14,526
But if they're invisible,
how can I see them?

162
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,877
You have to look
really hard

163
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,054
because on earth,
they wear their wings inside

164
00:10:20,097 --> 00:10:23,057
so they can look
just like you and me.

165
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,930
I bet an angel
could bring my daddy home.

166
00:10:26,974 --> 00:10:28,497
Hmm...

167
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,718
If the angel
thought it was a good thing

168
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:35,635
for both you
and your daddy, maybe.

169
00:10:38,028 --> 00:10:39,595
But remember--

170
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,250
you have to be
a good little girl

171
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:45,079
to be lucky enough
to have an angel hear you.

172
00:10:45,122 --> 00:10:46,602
That means

173
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,604
not giving your mommy trouble

174
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,302
with school
and not climbing that tree!

175
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:54,697
I promise--
I'll never climb the tree again!

176
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:03,358
If there's
an angel listening,

177
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:05,839
please bring my daddy home

178
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:08,711
and get us a house
like my Dollhouse

179
00:11:08,755 --> 00:11:11,148
for us to live in together.

180
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:15,109
Except for today,
I've been a verygood girl.

181
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:17,981
How was she?

What's for dinner?

Stop! You're hurting me!

203
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:14,429
You're losing the reality.

204
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:17,214
You're a loving family--
where are the hugs and kisses?

205
00:12:17,258 --> 00:12:19,782
You're his wife--
you know what's for dinner.

I expect father knows best,
not family feud.

Let's go,
from the top.

211

like this just for a deal?

Sammy boy, thedeal.

you've busted your hump for

you'd be lucky to make janitor!

what's for dinner?

Okay,
just so you know,

218
00:12:49,638 --> 00:12:52,162
my agent said nothing
about making dinner.

219
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:54,643
I have a staff,
remember?

220
00:12:54,686 --> 00:12:56,645
And, while we're at it,

221
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:59,300
if you expect me
to sleep with you,

222
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:01,476

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,957

spank me, it's $150.

I'd have drowned him at birth.

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,424
I'm so sorry--

259
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:05,774
she didn't realize...

260
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:08,777
See,
the door was open.

00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,606

Zoey!

268
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:31,408
We shouldn't be here--
come on.

269
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:33,933
Mommy,
this is my Dollhouse!

270
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:36,587
No, sweetheart, this house
belongs to someone else.

271
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:38,241
Now, come on.

272
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:41,070
No, this is where
we're supposed to be!

273
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:43,072
You look familiar.

274
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:45,901
Yes, Mr. Field,
I work for you.

00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:49,774

Now, thatis a wife.

280
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,261
And a kid
you wouldn't want to drown.

281
00:15:58,305 --> 00:16:01,438
At least they look real,
and ordinary.

282
00:16:01,482 --> 00:16:03,266
We're going now.

283
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,094
No, wait, wait!

284
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:07,444
We need
to rent a family

285
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:10,099
to help us
do business with somebody.

286
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:12,928
Now, it's a couple of days,
$1,000,

287
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,931
everything absolutely open
and above board... honest.

288
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,760
What do you say?He's kidding, right?

289
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:20,414
I'm afraid not.

290
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:22,068
Oh, I get it--

291
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:24,418
your mother's
coming to town?

292
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:25,767
No.

293
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,595
No, no, no...

294
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:30,946
An important business associate
is flying in from Mexico.

295
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,254
And if you like us, Mr. Field,
is there an option to buy?

296
00:16:34,297 --> 00:16:36,604
This is serious business,
miss...?

297
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:38,736
Russell--
Kathleen Russell.

298
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,391
You'd be helping field industries,
Kathleen.

299
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:44,220
And loyalty to the company
has its own rewards--

300
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:48,050
gentlemen, my daughter and I
are not for lease-- excuse me.

301
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:50,574
Okay,
$2,000...

302
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:53,403
But that is
my final offer.

303
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:55,623
A thousand bucks a day.

304
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,842
You don't even go to work,
Kathleen.

305
00:16:57,886 --> 00:17:00,845
And all we have to do
is pretend to be your family?

306
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:02,499
That's all.

307
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:05,676
Ha, do you really think
you can pull this off?

308
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,982
Absolutely.

309
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,940
Three thousand.

310
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:10,464
Out of the question.

311
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:12,379
I wish you luck.

312
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:15,338
Okay...

313
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,038
Deal.

314
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,778
Not so fast.

315
00:17:20,822 --> 00:17:23,433
I need to discuss this
with my daughter.

316
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:25,261
Zoey, listen to me--

317
00:17:25,305 --> 00:17:27,698
mommy, take it!

318
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,313
Ha, I guess
we have a deal.

319
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:36,098
I now pronounce you
man and wife!

320
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,582
Psst... thank you.

322
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:59,034
Hey, Zoey... you know
how you like to make up stories?

323
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,688
To pretend?

324
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:03,169
You don't like it
when I pretend.

325
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:05,519
Yes, but this
is different.

326
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:08,043
You see,
Mr. Field is mommy's boss

327
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,567
and we're doing him
a big favour.

328
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:19,750

329
00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:22,057

park their car
out of sight, would you?

332
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:28,194
Yes...

333
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:55,221
So, is everybody um,
clear on the program?

334
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:58,311
Don't worry, Mr. Field,
we won't disappoint you.

335
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:06,841
May I make a suggestion?

336
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:10,061
What?

337
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:13,543
Your house is...
It's lovely,

338
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:18,200
but it doesn't exactly
look like a family lives here.

339
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:22,509
In fact, it barely
looks like you live here.

340
00:19:22,552 --> 00:19:27,992
It is a little cool,
isn't it?

341
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:31,344
Exactly, but perhaps
if you threw some toys around

342
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:34,651
and had a cheery fire
blazing in the fireplace...

343
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:37,176
Great idea--
that's a great idea!

344
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:40,962
Some family photos?

345
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:42,833
I brought these.

346
00:19:42,877 --> 00:19:45,184
Let's not
get carried away.

347
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:48,012
No, she has a point--
it sets the scene.

348
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:50,319
Yes... I mean,
take this tree.

349
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:53,235
It is stunning,
but did a designer do it?

350
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,195
Yes.

351
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:57,935
Yes, I thought so.

352
00:19:57,979 --> 00:19:59,328
Wait a minute.

353
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:01,852
You're not gonna mess
with my tree?!

354
00:20:01,896 --> 00:20:04,681
It's just
if I was really Mrs. Field,

355
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:08,032
I would put up
some old-fashioned ornaments.

356
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:11,035
Make it look like
a family decorated it, together.

357
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,863
Isn't that the point?

358
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:15,779
She's brilliant--
just do whatever she says.

359
00:20:17,303 --> 00:20:19,218
Kid, come here.

360
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:22,699
Do you think you can remember

00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,665
Good night, sir.

544
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,889
That was very smooth.

545
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:50,283
Del campo
was watching.

546
00:30:50,326 --> 00:30:53,112
What would he
have thought?

547
00:30:53,155 --> 00:30:54,461
Phew!

548
00:30:54,504 --> 00:30:57,290
Oh, could I go
to my room now?

549
00:30:57,333 --> 00:31:00,467
Yeah,
I'm sure it's okay.

550
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,426
Good night.
Good night.

551
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:09,780
He's still there.

552
00:31:20,052 --> 00:31:22,097
Okay...

553
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:25,753
You'll sleep here
tonight.

554
00:31:25,796 --> 00:31:27,624
I beg your pardon?

555
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:30,410
In fact,
you can even have my bed.

556
00:31:30,453 --> 00:31:32,586
I'll crash
on the couch.

557
00:31:32,629 --> 00:31:34,414
I don't think so.

558
00:31:34,457 --> 00:31:37,765
Suit yourself, but trust me,
the bed's more comfortable.

559
00:31:37,808 --> 00:31:40,768
My daughter may walk in here
in the middle of the night

560
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:42,770
and find us together.

561
00:31:42,813 --> 00:31:44,946
I can't share
your bedroom.

562
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:48,950
Miss Russell, may I remind you
this is a business transaction.

563
00:31:48,994 --> 00:31:53,520
And I'm a single mother
with an impressionable daughter.

564
00:31:53,563 --> 00:31:56,653
If she walks in here
and finds us together,

565
00:31:56,697 --> 00:32:00,135
you'll wish
you never had a family,

566
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:02,181
rented or otherwise.

567
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,450
Would you go
to bed already?!

568
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:16,412
Okay--

569
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:20,590
and just where do you propose
that I sleep?

570
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:22,636
In there?

571
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:24,986
In the dressing room?

572
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,466
Fine.

573
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:29,512
That's fine...
May I, at least,

574
00:32:29,556 --> 00:32:31,993
have my pillow?

575
00:32:36,911 --> 00:32:40,915
That's not my pillow.

576
00:32:44,658 --> 00:32:48,096
Is there
anything else you need?

577
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:51,926
No, no, no,
you don't!

578
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,667
I want in there

579
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:55,495
while it's still night.

580
00:32:55,538 --> 00:32:58,498
May I at least
have something to sleep in?

581
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:03,416
All of my things
are in the other room.

582
00:33:23,784 --> 00:33:26,830
Good night, daddy.

583
00:33:26,874 --> 00:33:30,747
I know you'll be here soon.

584
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:39,756
Good night, Mr. Del campo.

585
00:34:06,218 --> 00:34:08,307
Are you all right
in there?

586
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,960
No.

587
00:34:10,004 --> 00:34:13,355
Is my bed comfortable enough
for you?

588
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:16,358
Very.

589
00:34:16,402 --> 00:34:19,448
Well...

590
00:34:19,492 --> 00:34:22,451
Good night.

591
00:34:22,495 --> 00:34:25,193
Yeah.

592
00:34:35,029 --> 00:34:37,684
♪ Mexican-style instrumental

593
00:34:46,432 --> 00:34:48,129
Thank you very much!

594
00:34:48,173 --> 00:34:50,479
It's time,
I know you've waited,

595
00:34:50,523 --> 00:34:52,481
and here we are.Yummy!

596
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:55,005
Come...
You like that?Please.

597
00:34:55,049 --> 00:34:57,660
Taste-- it goes excellently
with that.

598
00:34:57,704 --> 00:34:59,662
Yes, very good.

599
00:34:59,706 --> 00:35:02,665
Oh, Jesus!
Water!

600
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:04,580
Aye, yi, yi, yi!

601
00:35:04,624 --> 00:35:06,321
Good night, sir!

602
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:07,888
Good night.

603
00:35:34,306 --> 00:35:37,352
Oh man...
There's no angle on this!

604
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:39,876
I don't suppose
you fellas

605
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,053
feel like calling off
that double-or-nothing?

606
00:35:43,097 --> 00:35:46,535
Uh-uh.
I didn't think so.

607
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:48,885
Oh, geez!

608
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:50,800
Well...

609
00:36:01,942 --> 00:36:03,857
Yes!

610
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,339
I couldn't make that one again
if my life depended on it!

611
00:36:07,382 --> 00:36:10,168
Let's settle up
over drinks, on me.

612
00:36:10,385 --> 00:36:13,171
Big deal.
Big deal.

613
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:18,959
Hey, Jerry!

614
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:21,918
Where the hell
you been hidin', buddy?

615
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:25,357
The tour ain't nearly been
as wild and crazy without you.

616
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,359
Tour?

617
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,756
Okay, okay!

618
00:36:44,158 --> 00:36:45,507
Where to?

619
00:36:45,551 --> 00:36:49,250
The bus station.

620
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:53,254
Where you headed?

621
00:36:53,298 --> 00:36:55,735
Home.

622
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,654
It's time to go home.

623
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,181
Good evening, sir.

624
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,444
Hawthorne,
we did it.

625
00:37:09,488 --> 00:37:11,446
Thank you, sir.

626
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,143
Okay...

627
00:37:13,187 --> 00:37:16,146
This is a really big toy
for a little girl.

628
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,279
And you know
what big toys do?

629
00:37:18,323 --> 00:37:19,976
They break things.

630
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,631
I'm not gonna
break anything.
Ow!

631
00:37:22,675 --> 00:37:26,156
Where's
Mr. Del campo?
Dave took him
to the airport.

632
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,421
Good, we're ready to go--
Zoey, get your coat.

633
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:31,771
But mommy,
we can't leave!

634
00:37:31,814 --> 00:37:33,599
Zoey,
what did I tell you?

635
00:37:33,642 --> 00:37:35,427
Now come on, please.

636
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,951
Thank you, Zoey,
you were very good.

637
00:37:37,994 --> 00:37:39,431
Any time.

638
00:37:39,474 --> 00:37:41,781
She was--
she was great!

639
00:37:41,824 --> 00:37:44,305
As were you, Mrs...
Missrussell.

640
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:46,612
Thank you.
You're welcome.

641
00:37:46,655 --> 00:37:49,136
Mr. Hawthorne?Yes, madame?

642
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:52,618
We're going-- would you
put my bags in my car, please?

643
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:55,316
Certainly,
madame.
Thank you.

644
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,145
How did it feel,
being a family man?

645
00:37:58,188 --> 00:38:00,103
Completely terrifying.

646
00:38:00,974 --> 00:38:02,976
Good evening, sir.

647
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:07,067
Great news, everybody!
Senor del campo's staying

648
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,809
until negotiations
are completed!

649
00:38:09,852 --> 00:38:13,160
Of course, that would require
extending my visit

650
00:38:13,203 --> 00:38:15,467
another 2 weeks.

651
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,469
I wouldn't dream
of imposing

652
00:38:17,512 --> 00:38:19,166
on your hospitality.

653
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:21,821
No, Sam is only too happy
to have you stay.

654
00:38:21,864 --> 00:38:24,998
Su casais mi casa,
right?
We're happy
to have you.

655
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:26,826
Aren't we, darling?

656
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:29,002
Yes!
Absolutely.

657
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:31,265
Will you excuse us,
please?

658
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,963
My wife and I
need to talk to the cook.

659
00:38:34,007 --> 00:38:36,096
Oh, senora field,

660
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:38,403
I noticed your luggage.

661
00:38:38,446 --> 00:38:40,840
Are you
going somewhere?

662
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:42,842
Well--
no!

663
00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:45,758
No, that's just...
Old stuff for goodwill.

664
00:38:45,801 --> 00:38:47,194
Hawthorne,

665
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:49,414
take care of that,
will you?

666
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:50,632
Yes, sir.

667
00:38:53,113 --> 00:38:55,463
Our deal
was for two days!

668
00:38:55,507 --> 00:38:58,336
I'm not any happier
about this than you are.

669
00:38:58,379 --> 00:39:00,338
Five thousand.
Ten.

670
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:02,470
$10,000!...
Are you crazy?

671
00:39:02,514 --> 00:39:05,343
All right-- but you stay
as long as it takes.

672
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:06,561
Fine.

673
00:39:06,605 --> 00:39:08,911
Mr. Field,
whatever happens,

674
00:39:08,955 --> 00:39:12,437
I need to be sure I have a job
to go back to when this is over.

675
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,309
You'll be
taken care of.

676
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:19,226
And...
You can call me Sam.

677
00:39:22,577 --> 00:39:25,580
Paragraph two--
fix that, too,

678
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:28,104
so it doesn't read
like I said...

679
00:39:30,455 --> 00:39:32,587
Left foot, green!

680
00:39:32,631 --> 00:39:37,070
And the amendments
for section three--
right hand,
red!

681
00:39:37,113 --> 00:39:41,291
Okay, this is--
regards--

682
00:39:43,816 --> 00:39:46,296
Okay, left hand, blue,
senor.

683
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,603
Right hand, yellow,
Zoey.

684
00:39:48,647 --> 00:39:50,605
Right hand...

685
00:39:50,649 --> 00:39:52,781
Over here...
Okay.

686
00:39:55,088 --> 00:39:58,047
Left hand, yellow.

687
00:39:58,091 --> 00:40:00,180
Here we go!

688
00:40:04,314 --> 00:40:06,142
Right hand, red.

689
00:40:06,186 --> 00:40:08,667
Well...you can do it!

690
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:09,972
Ohh!

691
00:40:11,321 --> 00:40:13,280
I win, ha!!

692
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,415
Come play with us!

693
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,895
Oh, no,
I don't think so.

694
00:40:19,939 --> 00:40:21,244
Why not?

695
00:40:21,288 --> 00:40:23,203
I'm not good
at games.

696
00:40:23,246 --> 00:40:26,293
It's not about skill--
it's about fun.

697
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:30,079
There's much more to life
than just work, senor field.

698
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:33,300
Come!
Popcorn's ready!

699
00:40:33,343 --> 00:40:34,954
Absolutely.

700
00:40:34,997 --> 00:40:38,479
Mommy, you play
and I'll spin the wheel!

701
00:40:38,523 --> 00:40:41,743
Oh, I don't think so.

702
00:40:41,787 --> 00:40:43,876
What's the matter?

703
00:40:43,919 --> 00:40:46,835
Afraid you'll have
a little fun?

704
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:55,583
Left foot, red!

705
00:40:55,627 --> 00:40:57,585
Left foot, red.

706
00:40:57,629 --> 00:41:00,109
Watch this...

707
00:41:03,156 --> 00:41:05,027
Got it.

708
00:41:06,768 --> 00:41:08,466
Right hand, blue.

709
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:10,772
Right hand, blue.

710
00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:12,600
That's it?

711
00:41:12,644 --> 00:41:14,297
That's it?

712
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:16,299
Gimme an easy one.

713
00:41:16,343 --> 00:41:18,954
Left hand, red!

714
00:41:18,998 --> 00:41:21,609
Left hand, red--
that's easy.

715
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:24,307
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

716
00:41:24,351 --> 00:41:25,918
Ha!

717
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:27,659
Right foot, red.

718
00:41:27,702 --> 00:41:30,531
Okay...

719
00:41:30,575 --> 00:41:32,359
Oh...

720
00:41:32,402 --> 00:41:34,187
Oh, no!

721
00:41:40,236 --> 00:41:42,848
You guys are funny!

722
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:45,546
I won--
I won!

723
00:42:07,002 --> 00:42:10,049
They're not home,
Mr. Russell.

724
00:42:10,092 --> 00:42:13,052
Ah, Bridget--
you're a sight for sore eyes!

725
00:42:13,095 --> 00:42:15,402
It's good to see you,
darling.

726
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:17,709
So, when are they
gonna be back?

727
00:42:17,752 --> 00:42:19,406
I'm not certain.

728
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:21,408
Well, where are they?

729
00:42:21,451 --> 00:42:24,716
Look Bridget, I know I shoulda
been back here a lot sooner.

730
00:42:24,759 --> 00:42:27,240
What's it been--
two, three months?

731
00:42:27,283 --> 00:42:28,981
Sixmonths.

732
00:42:29,024 --> 00:42:30,983
Six months?

733
00:42:31,026 --> 00:42:33,551
All right, you got me.

734
00:42:35,074 --> 00:42:39,208
Look, I just... I wanna spend
Christmas with my little girl.

735
00:42:40,732 --> 00:42:42,647
Has she asked about me?

736
00:42:47,086 --> 00:42:51,960
Kathleen gave me an address...
For emergencies only.

737
00:43:02,797 --> 00:43:05,583
Ahem!

738
00:43:05,626 --> 00:43:08,063
Oh, hi.

739
00:43:11,676 --> 00:43:14,330
Sweetheart,
could you do me a big favour

740
00:43:14,374 --> 00:43:16,332
and not touch anything?

741
00:43:16,376 --> 00:43:18,639
I'll take those clips--
thank you.

742
00:43:18,683 --> 00:43:21,773
You don't like kids,
do you?

743
00:43:21,816 --> 00:43:24,950
There's nothing wrong
with kids.

744
00:43:24,993 --> 00:43:28,475
Just like there's
nothing wrong with broccoli.

745
00:43:28,518 --> 00:43:31,957
Some people have a taste for it;
Some people don't.

746
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,524
Do you like broccoli?

747
00:43:34,568 --> 00:43:36,178
No.

748
00:43:36,222 --> 00:43:38,398
Me neither.

749
00:43:38,441 --> 00:43:41,619
Dinner's almost ready--
where's Mr. Del campo?

750
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:44,752
Choo! Choo!
Dave took him
to a restaurant.

751
00:43:44,796 --> 00:43:47,755
Look, do you think
you could keep her out of here?

752
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:49,757
This is not a play room

753
00:43:49,801 --> 00:43:52,325
and this
is not a toy, okay?

754
00:43:52,368 --> 00:43:55,328
She won't bother
anything.

755
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:58,679
Could you tell me something--
how do you get her to listen?

756
00:43:58,723 --> 00:44:00,115
Zoey,

757
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:03,379
from now on
this room is off-limits.

758
00:44:04,946 --> 00:44:07,296
It's not that hard.

759
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,168
Thank you.

760
00:44:18,568 --> 00:44:21,615
You cut up my cigars!

761
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,357
They're bad for you--
Mr. Hawthorne told me.

762
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,969
These are
Cuban cigars!
Don't yell at her!

763
00:44:28,013 --> 00:44:30,319
Do you know
how much these cost?

764
00:44:30,363 --> 00:44:32,974
Put that down!

765
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,936
Give me that!

766
00:44:37,979 --> 00:44:39,633
That's terrific.

767
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,592
Why is it that everything
you touch gets broken?

768
00:44:42,636 --> 00:44:45,465
You're not my daddy!

769
00:44:46,727 --> 00:44:48,729
This little arrangement

770
00:44:48,773 --> 00:44:51,732
does not allow you
to discipline my daughter!

771
00:44:51,776 --> 00:44:54,735
If you'd teach her some
boundaries, she'd know better!

772
00:44:54,779 --> 00:44:56,737
Oh,
that's great advice

773
00:44:56,781 --> 00:44:59,044
from a man
who renteda family!

774
00:44:59,087 --> 00:45:01,394
Could you
leave me alone now?

775
00:45:01,437 --> 00:45:03,657
I'll do even
better than that.

776
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,271
We quit!

777
00:45:26,593 --> 00:45:28,203
It's my fault
we had to leave.

778
00:45:28,247 --> 00:45:30,858
None of this
is your fault.

779
00:45:30,902 --> 00:45:34,775
I'll be right back.

780
00:45:40,259 --> 00:45:42,130
I know... whoa!

781
00:45:42,174 --> 00:45:45,090
Wait, wait, wait!
I know I was a jerk.

782
00:45:45,133 --> 00:45:48,093
Just give me a chance
to apologize.

783
00:45:48,136 --> 00:45:50,443
To Zoey.

784
00:45:50,486 --> 00:45:52,837
Okay.

785
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:57,319
Zoey,
Mr. Field is here

786
00:45:57,363 --> 00:46:00,322
and he has something
to say to you.

787
00:46:00,366 --> 00:46:02,803
Will you
talk to him?

788
00:46:08,635 --> 00:46:10,289
I'm sorry, Zoey.

789
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,206
What do I have to do

790
00:46:14,249 --> 00:46:16,599
to get you to forgive me?

791
00:46:16,643 --> 00:46:19,167
A pony would be nice.

792
00:46:19,211 --> 00:46:20,952
A pony?

793
00:46:20,995 --> 00:46:23,955
You're a heck
of a negotiator.

794
00:46:23,998 --> 00:46:26,784
I could use you
with del campo, ha.

795
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:31,876
Look, I'm really sorry, Zoey.

796
00:46:31,919 --> 00:46:34,835
I was--dumb?

797
00:46:34,879 --> 00:46:37,577
Yeah, yeah... real dumb.

798
00:46:38,665 --> 00:46:41,233
Can you forgive me?

799
00:46:41,276 --> 00:46:43,278
I guess so.

800
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:48,980
I didn't mean
to mess up your desk.

801
00:46:49,023 --> 00:46:50,851
Oh...

802
00:46:50,895 --> 00:46:52,331
That's okay.

803
00:46:52,374 --> 00:46:54,333
It's just water.

804
00:46:55,334 --> 00:46:57,815
Can we go back
to the house now?

805
00:47:00,687 --> 00:47:02,689
We can go now.

806
00:47:02,732 --> 00:47:05,170
All right!
I'll get dressed.

807
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:21,099
That was very nice
of you, Sam.

808
00:47:21,142 --> 00:47:24,276
Don't let it get around--
it could ruin my reputation.

809
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,455
So, we'll stay
until del campo leaves.

810
00:47:29,498 --> 00:47:32,632
Than,
you're saving my neck.

811
00:47:32,675 --> 00:47:35,635
Your neck
isn't my concern.

812
00:47:35,678 --> 00:47:38,638
I have plans
for that money.

813
00:47:39,682 --> 00:47:41,859
Are you the artist?

814
00:47:43,295 --> 00:47:45,819
Very good!

815
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:49,214
I mean,
it's terrific.

816
00:47:49,257 --> 00:47:52,565
You ever thought
of doing this professionally?

817
00:47:52,608 --> 00:47:55,829
I wanted to study
in Paris,

live abroad for awhile.

819
00:47:58,179 --> 00:48:00,573

Jerry left...

been easy for you

He's in astronaut school.

946
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:23,048
That's why him and my mommy
got divorced.

give you that toy?

Uh-huh.

won't tell mom?

a birthday present

and said my dad sent it.

957
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:55,210
And I know it
was really from her.

958
00:57:58,126 --> 00:58:00,781
How do you know that?

959
00:58:00,825 --> 00:58:03,392
I'm seven
but I'm not stupid.

960
00:58:03,436 --> 00:58:05,351
My mom said:

961
00:58:05,394 --> 00:58:08,310
It was from him so I wouldn't
think he forgot about me.

962
00:58:08,354 --> 00:58:11,313

would make her feel bad.

00:58:13,185 --> 00:58:14,839
Okay.

965
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:18,538
I don't care
about presents.

966
00:58:18,582 --> 00:58:22,107
I just wish
he'd come home for Christmas.

967
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:25,414
I don't know what I did
that was so bad

968
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:27,982
that he didn't want me
no more.

969
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:30,637
Any more.

970
00:58:30,681 --> 00:58:32,770
Any more.

971
00:58:32,813 --> 00:58:35,512
But there's gotta be a reason
why he doesn't come to see me.

972
00:58:35,555 --> 00:58:38,776
I know I'm clumsy
and I drop stuff.

973
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:43,084
Daddy calls me
butterfingers.

974
00:58:43,128 --> 00:58:47,654
Do you think if I wasn't
so clumsy he would've stayed?

975
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:53,312
Oh no, Zoey,

976
00:58:53,355 --> 00:58:57,142
everybody drops stuff;
It's not a big deal.

977
00:58:59,274 --> 00:59:02,887
Maybe I'm just
not lovable.

978
00:59:03,975 --> 00:59:06,238
Of course you are.

979
00:59:10,634 --> 00:59:14,333
Zoey, some people
are just really good

980
00:59:14,376 --> 00:59:16,596
at loving other people.

981
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,293
You know?

982
00:59:20,339 --> 00:59:23,864
And some people
don't know how.

983
00:59:23,908 --> 00:59:26,301
Nobody ever showed them.

984
00:59:26,345 --> 00:59:28,695
Like I showed you
how to skate?

985
00:59:28,739 --> 00:59:31,480
Yeah, sort of.

986
00:59:32,525 --> 00:59:34,483
Did your dad love you?

987
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,361
It didn't always feel
like he did.

988
00:59:43,841 --> 00:59:46,365
Why not?
Were you bad?

989
00:59:46,408 --> 00:59:48,628
I wasn't...

990
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:50,804
Good enough--

991
00:59:50,848 --> 00:59:53,111
at sports.

992
00:59:53,154 --> 00:59:55,766
That was important
to him.

993
00:59:55,809 --> 00:59:59,378
He was a star
of his college baseball team.

994
00:59:59,421 --> 01:00:03,121
Your dad should've loved you
even if you couldn't

995
01:00:03,164 --> 01:00:05,210
do stuff perfect.

996
01:00:05,253 --> 01:00:07,865
Can I tell you
a secret?

997
01:00:07,908 --> 01:00:09,693
Sure!

998
01:00:11,695 --> 01:00:16,090
I remember one time
I was about your age and my dad

999
01:00:16,134 --> 01:00:20,181
was trying to teach me
how to catch a ball, you know?

1000
01:00:20,225 --> 01:00:23,184
And he kept
throwing the ball

1001
01:00:23,228 --> 01:00:26,013
and I kept missing it.

1002
01:00:26,057 --> 01:00:29,364
Mostly because the glove
that he gave me

1003
01:00:29,408 --> 01:00:33,238
was too big for my hand;
It kept slipping.

1004
01:00:33,281 --> 01:00:37,285
He kept looking
more and more mad.

1005
01:00:37,329 --> 01:00:40,941
And he threw
one last ball,

1006
01:00:40,985 --> 01:00:44,858
he threw it really,
really high in the air.

1007
01:00:44,902 --> 01:00:49,210
As I watched it come down,
I prayed to god to catch it,

1008
01:00:49,254 --> 01:00:51,517
just one time--

1009
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,519
did you catch it?

1010
01:00:53,562 --> 01:00:56,130
It hit my glove...

1011
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:02,615
But I couldn't
hold onto it.

1012
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,661
The glove slipped,

1013
01:01:04,704 --> 01:01:06,401
I dropped the ball.

1014
01:01:06,445 --> 01:01:08,839
What did your dad do?

1015
01:01:10,928 --> 01:01:14,845
He just
looked at me.

1016
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:18,675
And then...

1017
01:01:18,718 --> 01:01:20,981
He walked away.

1018
01:01:21,025 --> 01:01:23,636
And that was it
for "catch".

1019
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,117
It wasn't your fault,
it was the stupid glove!

1020
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,467
He should've got you
a glove that fit!

1021
01:01:35,256 --> 01:01:37,432
You know, Zoey,

1022
01:01:37,476 --> 01:01:40,174
I never told anybody
that before.

1023
01:01:40,218 --> 01:01:42,655
Oh, don't worry,
I won't tell.

1024
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,701
Cross my heart and hope to die

1025
01:01:44,744 --> 01:01:47,181
Stick 1,000 needles
in my eye.

1026
01:01:47,225 --> 01:01:50,228
Yeah, yeah!
You'd better get some sleep.

1027
01:01:50,271 --> 01:01:52,230
Night, night.

1028
01:01:52,273 --> 01:01:54,667

1030
01:02:03,197 --> 01:02:05,678
Good night.

1031
01:02:32,487 --> 01:02:34,185
Oh, hi.

1032
01:02:34,228 --> 01:02:37,014
I thought you
could use this.

1033
01:02:37,057 --> 01:02:38,929
Oh, thanks.

1034
01:02:42,671 --> 01:02:44,369
She's a bright kid.

1035
01:02:44,412 --> 01:02:47,764
Ha, a little too bright,
sometimes!

1036
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:51,680
If you don't mind my asking:
Where's her father?

1037
01:02:53,247 --> 01:02:55,336
Who knows?

1038
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:57,817
Jerry is--

1039
01:02:57,861 --> 01:03:01,125
well, he's something
of a con artist.

1040
01:03:01,168 --> 01:03:04,650
A golfer who couldn't stay
on the tour.

1041
01:03:04,693 --> 01:03:08,436
He left six months ago
without saying good-bye to Zoey.

1042
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,918
So, she keeps thinking
he'll come back.

1043
01:03:11,962 --> 01:03:14,834
Does he
ever see her?

1044
01:03:14,878 --> 01:03:17,881
He phones
now and then.

1045
01:03:17,924 --> 01:03:21,885
The last time
was a few months ago.

1046
01:03:21,928 --> 01:03:25,497
He said
he would be passing through

1047
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:28,195
and that he
would stop by.

1048
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:31,329
She fell asleep
waiting by the window.

1049
01:03:31,372 --> 01:03:33,461
What happened?

1050
01:03:33,505 --> 01:03:36,464
He never showed up.

1051
01:03:36,508 --> 01:03:39,380
After that,
she started...

1052
01:03:39,424 --> 01:03:42,470
You know,
having some problems.

1053
01:03:42,514 --> 01:03:44,995
You should make him
see her.

1054
01:03:45,038 --> 01:03:47,693
You can't make someone
be a parent.

1055
01:03:47,736 --> 01:03:50,696
You, of all people,
should understand that.

1056
01:03:50,739 --> 01:03:54,004
I just haven't met
the right person, that's all.

1057
01:03:54,047 --> 01:03:56,267
Look, Sam...

1058
01:03:56,310 --> 01:03:59,792
Ahem, I don't know
if you realize it,

1059
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,838
but Zoey is--

1060
01:04:01,881 --> 01:04:04,666
she's becoming
very fond of you.

1061
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:06,799
I wouldn't encourage it.

1062
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,453
Because?

1063
01:04:08,496 --> 01:04:11,717
Because you're just passing
through her life, too.

1064
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,068
I feel bad enough about
putting her in this position.

1065
01:04:15,112 --> 01:04:18,289
So, please,
just let us do our job

1066
01:04:18,332 --> 01:04:20,944
and leave
when it's finished

1067

with no hurt feelings.

1068
01:04:23,381 --> 01:04:24,904

1081
01:05:13,953 --> 01:05:16,216
that's no problem,
right?

1082
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:18,523
You're welcome to share
the holiday with us.

1083
01:05:18,566 --> 01:05:20,873
But, don't you have--?

1084
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,006
There's only my son
and his family.

1085
01:05:23,049 --> 01:05:25,182
They're in Hong Kong
until the new year.

1086
01:05:25,225 --> 01:05:27,880
He has business
there.Excuse me.

1087
01:05:47,378 --> 01:05:49,423
Do Kathleen and Zoey
know you're here?

1088
01:05:49,467 --> 01:05:52,122
No, but I'm seeing them after
I find out what you're up to.

1089
01:05:52,165 --> 01:05:53,819
What do you mean?

1090
01:05:53,862 --> 01:05:56,474
Lemme help you...
You and Kathleen aren't married,

1091
01:05:56,517 --> 01:05:58,737
she hasn't moved out
of her apartment.

1092
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:00,913
So, why are they
living with you?

1093
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:03,394
Kathleen's helping me out
with a business transaction.

1094
01:06:03,437 --> 01:06:05,874
Ha, don't hustle
a hustler!

1095
01:06:05,918 --> 01:06:08,399
So, how does it feel to be
in the middle

1096
01:06:08,442 --> 01:06:10,967
of closing the biggest deal
of your life?

1097
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:13,491
I don't see how this
is any of your concern.

1098
01:06:13,534 --> 01:06:16,450
What concerns my wife
and child concerns me.

1099
01:06:16,494 --> 01:06:18,800
Ex-wife.
Still...

1100
01:06:18,844 --> 01:06:22,021
What would Javier del campo say
if he knew

1101
01:06:22,065 --> 01:06:24,154
they're not your family?

1102
01:06:24,197 --> 01:06:27,592
I think he'd say "ay, caramba!"
And hightail it back to Mexico.

1103
01:06:27,635 --> 01:06:31,683
How much do you want, Jerry?

1104
01:06:31,726 --> 01:06:34,164
I just need a little something
to tide me over

1105
01:06:34,207 --> 01:06:35,904
till I get back on the tour.

1106
01:06:35,948 --> 01:06:38,211
Somewhere north of $10,000,
south of 20.

1107
01:06:38,255 --> 01:06:40,083
Let's make it 20.

1108
01:06:40,126 --> 01:06:42,389
You'll have it the day after
Christmas on one condition:

1109
01:06:42,433 --> 01:06:45,827
You don't contact Kathleen
or Zoey until then.

1110
01:06:45,871 --> 01:06:48,004
If I want to see my family,
I'll see 'em.

1111
01:06:48,047 --> 01:06:50,180
Not until after Christmas

1112
01:06:50,223 --> 01:06:52,182
or we have no deal.

1113
01:06:52,225 --> 01:06:54,053
Okay, okay...

1114
01:06:54,097 --> 01:06:56,055
Call my office.

1115
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:58,405
Leave your address
and phone number.

1116
01:06:58,449 --> 01:07:00,059
I'll contact you.

1117
01:07:00,103 --> 01:07:04,063
A pleasure doing business
with you, Sam.

1118
01:07:04,107 --> 01:07:08,024
Why didn't you say good-bye
to Zoey?

1119
01:07:09,112 --> 01:07:11,723
I couldn't.

1120
01:07:15,292 --> 01:07:18,773
You'll find most of the terms
of the agreement are outlined--

1121
01:07:18,817 --> 01:07:21,950
well... Mexican
wedding-cake cookies!

1122
01:07:21,994 --> 01:07:24,344
Senora field,
they're perfect!

1123
01:07:24,388 --> 01:07:26,999
Thank you.
Thank you!

1124
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,957
Yum!

1125
01:07:29,001 --> 01:07:31,569
Ahem, anyway...
Where were we?

1126
01:07:31,612 --> 01:07:33,788
The contract
of sale--

1127
01:07:33,832 --> 01:07:36,226
sale?... I thought this
was a merger.

1128
01:07:36,269 --> 01:07:38,228
Well, not exactly.

1129
01:07:38,271 --> 01:07:40,926
Don't worry about it, darling,
it's just business.

1130
01:07:40,969 --> 01:07:42,493
You wouldn't understand.

1131
01:07:42,536 --> 01:07:45,148
I think even my dense,
little female brain

1132
01:07:45,191 --> 01:07:47,585
can tell the difference
between a merger

1133
01:07:47,628 --> 01:07:49,021
and a sale.

1134
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,154
Will production
move to Mexico?

1135
01:07:51,197 --> 01:07:53,460
Oh yes,
of course.

1136
01:07:53,504 --> 01:07:57,116
That means most employees
will lose their jobs.

1137
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,814
Are you certain
that is not a problem?

1138
01:07:59,858 --> 01:08:02,643
Oh, well--
that's
no problem at all.

1139
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:05,211
Because we have
a referral plan;

1140
01:08:05,255 --> 01:08:06,952
they'll be fine.Just fine?

1141
01:08:06,995 --> 01:08:08,432
Yes.

1142
01:08:08,475 --> 01:08:10,608
Could you ask Annie
for some more coffee

1143
01:08:10,651 --> 01:08:13,132
to go with these
delicious cookies... dear?

1144
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,485
Certainly... "Dear".

1145
01:08:21,662 --> 01:08:25,188
Oh Annie, the gentlemen
would like more coffee.

1146
01:08:25,231 --> 01:08:28,974
And put some arsenic
in Mr. Field's.

1147
01:08:33,848 --> 01:08:36,547
The deferred
purchase price--Mr. Field,

1148
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:40,028
you're wanted on the floor...
Culpepper says it's urgent.

1149
01:08:40,072 --> 01:08:43,336
He wants something
done right.

1150
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:45,425
Excuse me
gentlemen.

1151
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,132
Well!

1152
01:09:00,223 --> 01:09:03,530
♪

1153
01:09:16,674 --> 01:09:18,676
Champagne,
gentlemen?

1154
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,334
Mr. Field,
it's not my fault.

1155
01:09:24,377 --> 01:09:26,205
It happened in an instant.

1156
01:09:26,249 --> 01:09:28,338
Once it started,
it was like a revolt!

1157
01:09:28,381 --> 01:09:30,862
There you are! I knew you
wouldn't want to miss this.

1158
01:09:30,905 --> 01:09:32,864
The ringleader.Loosen up.

1159
01:09:32,907 --> 01:09:36,302
Miss Russell,
what is going on?

1160
01:09:36,346 --> 01:09:40,263
It's real nice of you
to throw this bash for us.

1161
01:09:40,306 --> 01:09:41,829
Carly's a single mother.

1162
01:09:41,873 --> 01:09:44,180
Like most women
working here.

1163
01:09:44,223 --> 01:09:46,007
Pleased to meet you.

1164
01:09:46,051 --> 01:09:47,835
The pleasure is mine.

1165
01:09:47,879 --> 01:09:50,011
I want to thank you,
Mr. F.

1166
01:09:50,055 --> 01:09:53,189
In six months, I'll have saved
enough of my hard-earned money

1167
01:09:53,232 --> 01:09:55,495
to go to nursing school
at night.

1168
01:09:55,539 --> 01:09:57,497
And it's all thanks to you.

1169
01:09:57,541 --> 01:09:59,151
Cheers!

1170
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:02,372
Over there
is Sarah Quincy.

1171
01:10:02,415 --> 01:10:04,678
Her baby's due
next month.

1172
01:10:04,722 --> 01:10:07,028
She really should be
at home, resting.

1173
01:10:07,072 --> 01:10:09,727
But she and her husband bought
a new house and need 2 incomes.

1174
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:11,685
Kathleen--
look!

1175
01:10:11,729 --> 01:10:14,819
Susan Epstein's been here
since the day the plant opened.

1176
01:10:14,862 --> 01:10:17,735
In a way, she has as much
invested here as you do,

1177
01:10:17,778 --> 01:10:20,868
ha, come with me
will you please?
She's
been working--

1178
01:10:20,912 --> 01:10:23,088
well!

1179
01:10:23,131 --> 01:10:26,657
Okay, you've made your point--
now I'll make mine!

1180
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:29,181
Let me explain
how business works.

1181
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:32,184
It's a fast track: You either
run in front or get run over.

1182
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:35,274
I wanted you to see them before
you take away their security.

1183
01:10:35,318 --> 01:10:37,624
There are plenty of jobs
for people like them.

1184
01:10:37,668 --> 01:10:40,148
You can't begin to understand
what it's like out there.

1185
01:10:40,192 --> 01:10:42,455
I know what it's like,
being there once.

1186
01:10:42,499 --> 01:10:44,805
I worked my way up
and so can these people!

1187
01:10:44,849 --> 01:10:47,634
You've forgotten what it's like
to live for each paycheque.

1188
01:10:47,678 --> 01:10:50,550
You've never stared into
a child's face who's too worried

1189
01:10:50,594 --> 01:10:52,509
to ask questions.

1190
01:10:52,552 --> 01:10:54,380
For a lot of these people,
this job is the only thing

1191
01:10:54,424 --> 01:10:56,556
that stands between them
and welfare!

1192
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,906
We can make of ourselves
anything we want.

1193
01:10:58,950 --> 01:11:02,083
It's called
free enterprise!
Is that
your father talking?

1194
01:11:02,127 --> 01:11:05,217
This has nothing to do
with my father!
Yes,
it does.

1195
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,872
You want his approval so badly,
you can't see he failed

1196
01:11:07,915 --> 01:11:09,395
at what matters.

1197
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:11,571
What would you
know about that?

1198
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:14,400
If you don't watch out, you'll
make the same mistake he did.

1199
01:11:14,444 --> 01:11:17,011
Now we're getting into
your area of expertise!

1200
01:11:17,055 --> 01:11:18,665
What do you mean?

1201
01:11:18,709 --> 01:11:21,189
You're so terrified
of repeating your mistakes

1202
01:11:21,233 --> 01:11:23,583
you won't let
another man near you.

1203
01:11:23,627 --> 01:11:25,324
Ha, that's absurd.

1204
01:11:25,368 --> 01:11:27,326
Is it really?

1205
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:29,981
You just can't accept that
there might be a woman out there

1206
01:11:30,024 --> 01:11:31,461
who doesn't want you.

1207
01:11:31,504 --> 01:11:34,159
Tell me
you don't think about me

1208
01:11:34,202 --> 01:11:36,770
when you're lying
in my bed at night.

1209
01:11:36,814 --> 01:11:39,643
Tell me you're not
tossing and turning--

1210
01:11:39,686 --> 01:11:41,906
and wondering...

1211
01:11:43,821 --> 01:11:46,258
I do wonder, Sam.

1212
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:49,435
Sometimes I feel
so close to you, it scares me.

1213
01:11:49,479 --> 01:11:52,264
Because I've already
been with a man

1214
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:55,223
who would sell out
his family and friends

1215
01:11:55,267 --> 01:11:56,877
for a deal.

1216
01:11:56,921 --> 01:11:58,662
What are you saying?

1217
01:11:58,705 --> 01:12:01,360
That if I make this deal
with del campo,

1218
01:12:01,404 --> 01:12:03,014
you're walking away?!

1219
01:12:03,057 --> 01:12:05,190
Wasn't that the plan
all along?

1220
01:12:05,233 --> 01:12:06,800
Yeah, no!

1221
01:12:06,844 --> 01:12:09,020
One thing has nothing to do
with the other!

1222
01:12:09,063 --> 01:12:10,717
Of course, it does.

1223
01:12:10,761 --> 01:12:13,677
Who's to say
if a better deal comes along,

1224
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:16,201
I won't wind up
like one of your workers.

1225
01:12:16,244 --> 01:12:18,551
Ha! That's good,
that's--

1226
01:12:18,595 --> 01:12:22,120
god, you are the most impossible
woman I have ever met!

1227
01:12:22,163 --> 01:12:26,124
I can see now why your husband
walked out on you!

1228
01:12:26,167 --> 01:12:28,996
Tell me then...

1229
01:12:30,084 --> 01:12:35,002
Why did he walk out
on Zoey, too?

1230
01:12:39,093 --> 01:12:41,008

Mr. Field?

1239
01:13:13,345 --> 01:13:15,565
I was hoping to leave
a little early.

1240
01:13:15,608 --> 01:13:18,089
I still have to get
a few last-minute presents.

1241
01:13:18,132 --> 01:13:20,439
Of course, you can--
good night.

01:13:30,275 --> 01:13:33,147
I forgot presents!

1247
01:13:55,779 --> 01:13:56,780
Ow!

1248
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:05,092
I think it goes
this way.

1249
01:14:06,529 --> 01:14:09,401

know that?

01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:12,404
Ah, I've done this
sort of thing before.

1251
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:15,668
Yeah, well...
That's enough, Mr. Dinosaur.

1252
01:14:15,712 --> 01:14:18,584
You tired?

1253
01:14:18,628 --> 01:14:20,630
Yeah.

1254
01:14:20,673 --> 01:14:23,633
Putting people out of work
must be exhausting.

1255
01:14:23,676 --> 01:14:26,244
Ha, look...
Kathleen--

1256
01:14:26,287 --> 01:14:28,768
I'll do
whatever it takes

1257
01:14:28,812 --> 01:14:31,379
to help those people
find other jobs.

1258
01:14:31,423 --> 01:14:33,947
I'm not throwing them out
with two weeks' notice.

1259
01:14:33,991 --> 01:14:36,602
I'll even provide
placement services.

1260
01:14:36,646 --> 01:14:38,474
I appreciate that.

1261
01:14:38,517 --> 01:14:40,867
And I'm sorry
I lost my head.

1262
01:14:40,911 --> 01:14:43,870
I didn't mean--
it's okay.

1263
01:14:43,914 --> 01:14:46,525
I was way
out of line.

1264
01:14:57,362 --> 01:15:00,278
I've never seen
so many presents.

1265
01:15:00,321 --> 01:15:02,846
Del campo
will be impressed.

1266
01:15:02,889 --> 01:15:05,631
They're not
for del campo's benefit,

1267
01:15:05,675 --> 01:15:07,198
they're for Zoey's.

1268
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:11,637
I don't know...

1269
01:15:11,681 --> 01:15:15,641
I just wanted to give her
a nice Christmas.

1270
01:15:15,685 --> 01:15:17,643
Thank you.

1271
01:15:17,687 --> 01:15:21,081
That's very thoughtful
of you.

1272
01:15:21,125 --> 01:15:23,257
I remember my dad.

1273
01:15:23,301 --> 01:15:27,914
He was a milkman
so, we didn't have much money.

1274
01:15:27,958 --> 01:15:31,135
But, every Christmas,
I would get one big gift.

1275
01:15:31,178 --> 01:15:33,964
One year, I got this
elaborate paint set.

1276
01:15:34,007 --> 01:15:36,836
I just went crazy--
I painted everything.

1277
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,751
I even painted the cat!

1278
01:15:38,795 --> 01:15:41,188
It was the best
Christmas ever.

1279
01:15:41,232 --> 01:15:43,060
What was yours?

1280
01:15:44,148 --> 01:15:46,542
This one.

1281
01:15:54,724 --> 01:15:56,552
My mother...

1282
01:15:56,595 --> 01:15:59,642
She used to put my pictures
up on the refrigerator,

1283
01:15:59,685 --> 01:16:01,992
she even framed
some of them.

1284
01:16:02,035 --> 01:16:04,168
She was proud
of me.

1285
01:16:04,211 --> 01:16:07,345
Made me think
I could be an artist for real.

1286
01:16:07,388 --> 01:16:09,173
You still can.

1287
01:16:09,216 --> 01:16:11,349
That's the dream, but...

1288
01:16:11,392 --> 01:16:14,352
Right now,
I have to think about Zoey.

1289
01:16:14,395 --> 01:16:17,790
You're really gutsy,
you know that?

There's something
I want you to tell you.

1292
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:31,021
The only reason
I avoided starting a family

1293
01:16:31,064 --> 01:16:34,981
is because I was afraid
I'd be a lousy father.

1294

Aren't you excited,

I guess so.

I borrowed one

the right size.

01:25:06,971 --> 01:25:09,147
How long
are you staying, Jerry?

1429
01:25:09,191 --> 01:25:12,150
I've gotta be leaving
tonight--tonight?

1430
01:25:12,194 --> 01:25:14,239
I've got this
great opportunity.

1431
01:25:14,283 --> 01:25:16,415
It could get me back
on the tour.

1432
01:25:16,459 --> 01:25:21,333
You're gonna be so proud
of your ol' man.

1433
01:25:27,992 --> 01:25:30,342
Before you leave this time,

1434
01:25:30,386 --> 01:25:33,606
you'd better say good-bye.

1435
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:47,664
You're leaving?

1436
01:25:47,707 --> 01:25:50,145
Afraid so, honey.

1437
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:53,713
I'd stay
if I could, but--

1438
01:25:53,757 --> 01:25:55,759
you can never stay.

1439
01:25:57,195 --> 01:26:01,243
Zoey, you're still
the best thing in my life.

1440
01:26:02,331 --> 01:26:05,116
I love you, darling.

1441
01:26:08,859 --> 01:26:12,515
But you and your momma,
you deserve something better.

1442
01:26:12,558 --> 01:26:15,909
Someone who can be with you
every day, honey.

1443
01:26:15,953 --> 01:26:19,043
And I think
you might have found that.

1444
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,875
Zoey...

1445
01:26:24,918 --> 01:26:26,703
Zoey?

1446
01:26:26,746 --> 01:26:30,620
You'll always be
my special girl, honey.

1447
01:26:35,712 --> 01:26:39,585
Good-bye.

What is she doing?

1458
01:27:35,815 --> 01:27:38,035
I want to see daddy.

1459
01:27:38,078 --> 01:27:39,863
I'll get her!

Oh, my god!

Listen to me Zoey,
I'm going to catch you!

1467
01:27:55,748 --> 01:27:57,881
All you have to do
is let go!

1468

No! I'm scared!

1469

Just do as he says.

I love you, Zoey.

anything happen to you.
