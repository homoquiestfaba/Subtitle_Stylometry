1
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,760
No, no, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no.

2
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,720
I'm lost !
Where's the line ?

3
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,640
It just went away.
What do I do ?

4
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,680
- Help !
- We'll be stuck here forever !

5
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,000
Do not panic.
Do not panic !

6
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,480
We are trained professionals.
Now, stay calm.

7
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,600
We are going around the leaf.

8
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,360
A-Around the leaf ?
I don't think we can do that.

9
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,160
Oh, nonsense. This is nothing
compared to the twig of '93.

10
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,520
You're doing great !
There you go. There you go !

11
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,640
Watch my eyes.
Don't look away.

12
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,520
- And here's the line again.
- Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Soil.

13
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,880
Oh, my.
There's quite a gap, Mr. Soil.

14
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,200
- Shouldn't we tell the queen ?
- I don't think we need
to involve the queen in this.

15
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,800
She's got enough on her plate already,
training her daughter.

16
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,600
Oh, yes.
Princess Atta, the poor dear.

17
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,200
Oh, wind's died down.
They'll be here soon.

18
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,000
- Just be confident, dear.
You'll be fine.
-  There's a gap.

19
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,880
There's a gap in the line.
What are we gonna do ?

20
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,320
It's okay, Your Highness. Gaps happen.
We just lost a few inches, that's all.

21
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,240
Oh. Right.

22
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,160
Your Highness, I can't count
when you hover like that.

23
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,080
Oh, of course.
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

24
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,640
- Guys, go shade
someone else for a while.

25
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,760
Okay, Atta.
Now what do we do ?

26
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,960
Ahh-- Oh ! Don't tell me.
I know it. What is it ?

27
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,360
- We relax.
-  Right.

28
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,680
Oh, it'll be fine.
It's the same, year after year.

29
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,840
They come, they eat, they leave.
That's our lot in life.

30
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,240
It's not a lot, but it's our life.

31
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,760
Isn't that right, Aphie ?
Oh, you're such a cute little aphid.

32
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,560
- Ditch Dot !
- Yeah, yeah !

33
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,760
Hey, come back here !

34
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,520
- Dot !
- Yes, Mother.

35
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,000
What did I tell you
about trying to fly ?

36
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,280
Not until my wings grow in.

37
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,200
- Right.
- But Mom--

38
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,920
Dot, you're a young queen ant
and your wings are too little--

39
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,400
I was talking to Mother.
You're not the queen yet, Atta.

40
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,920
Now, Dot,
be nice to your sister.

41
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,120
It's not my fault
she's so stressed out.

42
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,480
- I'm always acting
like the sky is falling.
- Look out !

43
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,120
- Atta !
- Princess Atta !

44
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,640
- Oh !
- Hey !

45
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,640
- Stop that !
- What do you think you're doing ?

46
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,360
- You could have killed
somebody over here.
-  I'm sorry !

47
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,200
- Oh, it's Flik.
- Oh--

48
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,320
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry !

49
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,520
- Please forgive me. I'm sorry !

50
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,400
-  Princess Atta !
- Flik, what are you doing ?

51
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,480
Oh, this ! This is my new idea
for harvesting grain.

52
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,680
No more picking individual kernels.
You cut down the entire stalk !

53
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,040
- We don't have time for this.
- Exactly ! We never have time
to collect food for ourselves.

54
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,120
We spend all summer
harvesting for the offering.

55
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,360
- But my invention will
speed up production.
- Oh, another invention ?

56
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,280
Something for you too.

57
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,360
Since you're gonna be queen, you could
use this to oversee production.

58
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,760
- Dr. Flora, if I may.
- This is all very nice, but--

59
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,080
- Just an ordinary blade of grass
and a bead of dew, right ?
- Flik, please.

60
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,480
- Wrong ! It is, in fact, a telescope.

61
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,960
- It's very clever, Flik, but--
- Hello, Princess ! Aren't you
looking lovely this morning !

62
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,720
Not that you would need
a telescope to see that.

63
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,520
Listen ! The princess doesn't
have time for this !

64
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,560
You wanna help fill this thing ?
Get rid of that machine,

65
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,880
get back in line and pick grain
like everybody else !

66
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,880
- Like everybody else !
- Please, Flik. Just go.

67
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,040
I'm sorry,
I was really just trying--

68
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,920
trying to help.

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,280
Harvester. Why, we harvested
the same way ever since I was a pupa.

70
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,800
- The food pile, Your Highness.
- Oh, yes, yes.

71
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,480
Hey, Flik ! Wait up !

72
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,400
Oh. Hello, Princess.

73
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,960
You can call me Dot.
Here, you forgot this.

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,640
Thanks. You can keep it.
I can make another one.

75
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,840
- I like your inventions.
- Really ? Well, you're the first.

76
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,480
- I'm beginning to think
nothing I do works.
- This works.

77
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,600
Great. One success.

78
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,400
- I'm never gonna make a difference.
- Me, neither.

79
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,040
I'm a royal ant and I can't
even fly yet. I'm too little.

80
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,920
- Being little's not such a bad thing.
- Yes, it is.

81
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,480
- No, it's not.
- Is too !

82
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,280
- Is not. Is not ! Is not !
- Is too. Is too ! Is too !

83
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,720
Oh ! A seed.
I need a seed. Ahh--

84
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,160
Ohh !

85
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,080
Ah, here, here.

86
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,040
Pretend-- pretend
that that's a seed.

87
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,160
- It's a rock.
- I know it's a rock.

88
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,840
But let's just pretend for a minute it's
a seed. We'll just use our imaginations.

89
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,760
Now, do you see our tree ?

90
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,840
Everything that made
that giant tree...

91
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,120
is already contained
inside this tiny little seed.

92
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,120
All it needs is some time, a little bit
of sunshine and rain, and...

93
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,080
voila !

94
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,440
This rock will be a tree ?

95
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,920
Seed to tree. You've gotta
work with me, all right ?

96
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,040
You might not feel
like you can do much now,

97
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,600
but that's just because,
well, you're not a tree yet.

98
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,600
You just have to give yourself
some time. You're still a seed.

99
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,880
But it's a rock.

100
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,800
I know it's a rock !

101
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,600
Don't ya think I know a rock
when I see a rock ? I've spent
a lot of time around rocks !

102
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,880
You're weird, but I like you.

103
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,200
They're here.

104
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,400
- They're coming !
- Run !

105
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,080
- Dot ! Dot !
- Mom !

106
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,240
- Mom !
- Thank heavens !

107
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,720
- Food to the offering stone.
- Everyone, single file.

108
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,160
Food to the offering stone
and into the anthill. Now let's go !

109
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,440
Go, go, go, go !

110
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,320
Come on, keep moving, keep moving !
Good.

111
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,800
Okay. That's everyone.

112
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,560
Hey, wait for me !

113
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,640
Get the food to the offering stone,
then into the anthill.

114
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,000
No ! No, no, no, no, no !
Oh, oh !

115
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,600
Oh, no.

116
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,520
Princess Atta !
Princess Atta !

117
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,440
Princess Atta !

118
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,160
They come, they eat, they leave.
They come, they eat, they leave.

119
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,640
Excuse me, pardon me.
Pardon me, excuse me. Coming through.

120
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,120
Sorry. Coming through. Princess Atta,
there's something I need to tell you.

121
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,080
- Not now, Flik. Shh !
- But Your Highness,
it's about the offering !

122
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,400
Yeah, where's the food ?

123
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,560
- What did you do ?
- It was an accident ?

124
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,840
Boo !

125
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,000
- Where's the food ?

126
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,800
- Hopper.
-

127
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,720
So, where is it ?

128
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,080
Where's my food ?

129
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,680
- I-I-Isn't it up there ?
- What ?

130
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,280
- The food was in a leaf
sitting on top--
- Excuse me.

131
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,400
Are you sure
it's not up there ?

132
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,480
- Are you saying I'm stupid ?
- No.

133
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,440
Do I look stupid... to you ?

134
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,760
Let's just think about the logic,
shall we? Think about it for a second.

135
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,800
If it was up there,
would I be coming down here,

136
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,760
to your level,
looking for it ?

137
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,160
- Uh, I--
- Why am I even talking to you ?

138
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,800
You're not the queen.
You don't smell like the queen.

139
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,680
Sh-She's learning
to take over for me, Hopper.

140
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,680
Oh, I see. Under new management.
So it's your fault.

141
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,680
No, it wasn't me, it was--

142
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,200
Uh-uh-uh. First rule of leadership:
Everything is your fault.

143
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,880
- But-But I--
- It's a bug-eat-bug world
out there, Princess,

144
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,120
one of those circle-of-life
kind of things.

145
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,440
Now, let me tell you
how things are supposed to work.

146
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,360
The sun grows the food,
the ants pick the food,

147
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,360
the grasshoppers eat the food--

148
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,440
And the birds eat the grasshoppers.

149
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,680
Hey, like the one that nearly ate you,
you 'member ? Oh, you shoulda seen it.

150
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,000
This blue jay has
him halfway down his throat,
and Hopper's kicking and screaming.

151
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,920
And I'm scared.
I'm not going anywhere near, okay ?

152
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,560
Aw, come on.
It's a great story. Ow, ow, ow.

153
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,320
I swear, if I hadn't promised
Mother on her deathbed...

154
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,920
that I wouldn't kill you,
I would kill you.

155
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,880
- And believe me, no one
appreciates that more than I do.
- Shut up !

156
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,120
I don't want to hear another word
out of you while we're on this island.

157
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,600
- Do you understand me ?

158
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,440
- I said, do you understand me ?
- How can I answer ? You said
I couldn't say another word.

159
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,960
- Remember Ma !

160
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,840
Hey, I'm a compassionate insect.

161
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,480
There's still a few months
till the rains come,

162
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,760
so you can all just try again.

163
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,480
But, Hopper, since it's
almost the rainy season,

164
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,680
we need this time
to gather food for ourselves.

165
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,160
Listen, if you don't
keep your end of the bargain,

166
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,320
then I can't guarantee your safety.

167
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,080
And there are insects out there
that will take advantage of you.

168
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,240
Someone could get hurt.

169
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,840
What's the matter ?
You scared of grasshoppers ?

170
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,520
- Dot !
- You don't like Thumper ?

171
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,320
You want her ?
Go ahead-- take her.

172
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,320
No ?
Then get back in line.

173
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,360
It seems to me that you ants
are forgetting your place.

174
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,400
So let's double
the order of food.

175
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,320
-
- No ! But-But--

176
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,640
We'll be back
at the end of the season,

177
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,120
when the last leaf falls.

178
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,080
You ants have a nice summer.
Let's ride !

179
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,840
- Yee-ha !

180
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,760
Flik, what do you have
to say for yourself ?

181
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,080
Sorry. I-- I'm sorry
for the way I am.

182
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,280
I didn't mean for things
to go so wrong.

183
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,720
I especially didn't want
to make you look bad, Princess.

184
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,920
- Well, Flik, ya did.
- I was just trying to help.

185
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,080
- Then help us-- don't help us.
- Help, help. Help?

186
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,240
Flik, you are sentenced to
one month digging in the tunnels.

187
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,960
Excuse me, Your Highness.
Need I remind you of Flik's
tunnel-within-a-tunnel project ?

188
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,440
Helpers to help us.
That's it ! We could--

189
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,640
It took two days to dig him out.
Send him to Health and Ant Services.

190
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,560
Heavens, no !

191
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,720
We could leave the island,
the river bed's dry.
We could walk across and get helpers.

192
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,440
We could ! We could go
find helpers to help us.

193
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,320
- It's perfect !
- Perfect ? What's so perfect ?

194
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,600
Your Highness, don't you see ?
We could send someone to get help !

195
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,320
Why didn't I think of that ?
Oh ! Because it's suicide !

196
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,680
-She's right! We never leave the island.
-Never leave !

197
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,040
There's snakes and birds
and bigger bugs out there !

198
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,280
Exactly ! Bigger bugs !

199
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,760
We could find bigger bugs
to come here and fight...

200
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,280
and forever rid us
of Hopper and his gang !

201
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,360
- Ludicrous!
- Who would do a crazy thing like that?

202
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,080
- I'll volunteer.
I'd be happy to volunteer.
-

203
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,640
You got a lot of spunk, kid,
but no one's gonna help a bunch of ants.

204
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,840
At least we could try. I could travel
to the city ! I could search there !

205
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,240
If you went, you'd be
on that silly search for weeks.

206
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,040
Royal huddle.

207
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,120
- Great idea, Princess. It's perfect !
- Exactly.

208
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,040
- Wait a minute.
What did we just decide here ?
- To let Flik leave.

209
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,800
While we keep harvesting
to meet Hopper's demands.

210
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,080
- You see, with Flik gone, he can't--
- He can't mess anything up !

211
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,800
Flik, after much deliberation, we have
decided to grant you your request.

212
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,480
- Really ?
- Really ?
- Uh, really.

213
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,920
Oh, thank you, Princess.
Thank you so much for this chance.

214
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,880
- I won't let you down,
I promise, I promise, I promise.
- That's fine. No, forget it.

215
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,880
- I should help repair
the damage before I go.
- No ! No, no !

216
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,040
Just leave !

217
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,880
Hey.

218
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,280
Don't worry !
The colony is in good hands !

219
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,520
Bye, now.

220
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,720
All right.

221
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,360
Hey, fellas.
Beautiful morning, huh ?

222
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,360
My dad gives you one hour
before you come back crying.

223
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,280
Does he, now ?

224
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,240
- My dad doesn't think that.
- He doesn't, huh ?

225
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,280
- Naw, he's betting you're gonna die.
- Oh.

226
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,960
He says if the heat doesn't get ya,
the birds will.

227
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,880
I think he's gonna make it.

228
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,400
-Nobody asked you, Your Royal Shortness.
-Yeah, Dot. What do you know?

229
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,640
Hey, hey, hey.
Ease up. Come on.

230
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,960
She's entitled
to her opinion too.

231
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,800
Ohh.

232
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,920
- So go, already.

233
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,240
- Hey !
- The city's that way.

234
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,640
- I know.
- You're supposed to look for bugs,
not dandelions.

235
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,080
You leave him alone.
He knows what he's doing.

236
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,120
That's right.

237
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:30,120
Here I go. For the colony,
and for oppressed ants everywhere !

238
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,040
Whoa-oh.

239
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,720
- Wow !
- Hey !

240
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,880
- Hey-hey !
- Bye, Flik !

241
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,840
Wow !

242
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,520
Wow. Ohh !

243
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,280
Whoa !

244
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,760
Good luck, Flik !

245
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,720
Bye ! Whoa-oh !

246
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,880
Flik !

247
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm... okay !

248
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,960
- Your dad's right. He's gonna die.
- You just watch.

249
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,760
He's gonna get the bestest,
roughest bugs you've ever seen !

250
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,000
Get back ! Get back !
Get back, you horrible beast !

251
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,440
- I have no fear ! Aye-eee !

252
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,040
- Ooh !
- Oh, my goodness.

253
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,680
- Oh, I'm so sorry, Dim. An owie ?
- Owie ! Owie, owie.

254
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,280
Please show Rosie the owie.
All right, Dim. It's okay.

255
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,720
I have been in outhouses
that didn't stink that bad.

256
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,360
This is ridiculous.
What a disappointment !

257
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,680
- Oh, no!
- You! Come here! I want my money back!

258
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,480
Uh, no refunds
after the first two minutes.

259
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,200
Popcorn ! Stale popcorn !

260
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,120
We're losing the audience !
You clowns get out there now !

261
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,600
- I hate performing on an empty stomach!
- Do your act, Heimlich.

262
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,840
- Then you can eat. Not now, Slim.
- P.T., what's the point ?

263
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,040
What's the point of going out there ?
They'll only laugh at me.

264
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,040
- That's because you're a clown !
- No, it's because I'm a prop !

265
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,640
You always cast me as the broom,
the pole, the stick, a splinter.

266
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,880
You're a walking stick.
It's funny !

267
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,160
- Now go !
- You parasite.

268
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,520
Tra-la-la-la-la.
Spring's in the air.

269
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,960
And I'm a flower with
nothing interesting to say.

270
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,920
-
- A bee !

271
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,200
I am a cute little bumblebee !
Here I come !

272
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,360
Slow down, you flowers !

273
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,840
Candy corn ! Here,
let me help you to finish it.

274
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,920
Hey, cutie ! Wanna pollinate
with a real bug ?

275
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,440
Ooh, come to papa !

276
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,000
So, being a ladybug automatically makes
me a girl, is that it, flyboy ? Huh ?

277
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,520
- She's a guy !
- Francis, leave them alone.

278
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,680
- They are poo-poo heads !
- Not again.

279
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,400
Judging by your breath, you must have
been buzzing around a dung heap all day.

280
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,680
- Come on, Francis.
You're making the maggots cry.

281
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,360
All right, we're dying out there.
Gypsy, quick ! You and Manny--

282
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,480
- Shh ! He's in a trance.

283
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,000
Well, get him out of it !
You and your husband are up now.

284
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,920
Manny, we're on.

285
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,680
Oh ? Yet again it is up to me
to rescue the performance.

286
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,600
- Gypsy, come.
-

287
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,360
- The stage is the other way, dear.
- Yes, of course.

288
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,280
Anytime, pal !

289
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,560
- I'm gonna pick the hairs
out of your head one by one !
- Take your best shot !

290
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,440
- You name the place !
- Oh, yeah ?

291
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,560
- Yeah, 'cause when you
get there, you are dead !
- Francis, let me handle this.

292
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,080
- That's no way to speak to a lady.
- I heard that, you twig.

293
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,680
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me
to present Manto the Magnificent...

294
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,080
and his lovely assistant, Gypsy !

295
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:07,080
>From the most mysterious
regions of uncharted Asia,

296
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,480
I give you the Chinese Cabinet...

297
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,200
of Metamorphosis !

298
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,680
Rosie, whole troupe.
On stage ! Finale ! Now !

299
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,320
- Okay, I just need time to--
Coming, coming.
- Now !

300
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,520
Tuck, Roll, let's get moving, guys.
We're up next.

301
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,160
Don't you understand ?
We are up !

302
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,640
- "Up-a."

303
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,800
- Hey !
- Hey ! They don't understand me.

304
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,000
I summon the voice
of Confucius--

305
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,520
Get off the stage,
you old hack !

306
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,600
I demand to know who said that !

307
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,880
-
- How dare you !

308
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,880
Ingrates !

309
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,640
Manny ? Manny !

310
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,720
I only got 24 hours to live
and I ain't gonna waste it here.

311
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,640
Come on.

312
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,200
I've just about
had it with these losers !

313
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,320
Flaming death !

314
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,400
I hold in my hand the match--

315
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,680
the match that decides whether two bugs
live or die this very evening.

316
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,440
In a moment, I will light
this trail of matches...

317
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,960
Leading to a sheet of flypaper
dowsed in lighter fluid !

318
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,400
Aimed directly at the flypaper
are Tuck and Roll,

319
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,840
the pill bug cannonballs !

320
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,880
The cannon
will be triggered by Dim,

321
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,040
trained to jump
at the sound of this bell...

322
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,200
set to go off in 15 seconds.

323
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,840
Our pill bugs' only hope
of survival is...

324
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,720
our mistress
of the high wire, Rosie !

325
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,160
Secured to a web line
of exact length,

326
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,240
Rosie will plummet down
to these two posts,

327
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,680
spinning a web of safety
in less than 15 seconds !

328
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,480
Not good enough, you say ?
Well, what if they were all...

329
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,400
blindfolded !

330
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,200
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I suggest that those of you...

331
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,640
with weak constitutions
leave the arena,

332
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,400
- for this act is so dangerous...

333
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,760
that if the slightest thing
should go wrong--

334
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,960
- No !
- Go ? Okay, through the tunnel--

335
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,080
- Whoa !

336
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,360
-
- Whoa !

337
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,840
-
- P.T. !
- Oh, no !

338
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,200
- Oh !
-

339
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,880
- Water ! We need some water !
- Water, water, water !

340
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,160
Get me outta here !

341
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,120
Oof !

342
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,720
-
- Wow !

343
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,960
- It's the web. I'm sorry.
- You're all fired.

344
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,760
- We got the water !
- Here we come, P.T. !

345
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,280
Whoo ! Whoa !
Burn them again !

346
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,200
No, Harry, no !
Don't look at the light !

347
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,960
I can't help it !
It's so beautiful !

348
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,720
Try not to look
like a country bug.

349
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,400
Blend-- blend in.

350
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,320
Hey, buggy !

351
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,600
What do you expect ?
The guy's a tick.

352
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,360
Wow ! The city !

353
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,920
Whoa-whoa-whoa !

354
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,840
Making all stops to the septic tank,
including standing water,

355
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,400
empty bean can and dead rat.

356
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,760
- Watch your stingers. All aboard !
- Whoa !

357
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,720
- Hey ! Oh, sorry.
- Get out of the way !

358
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,280
- Watch where you're going !
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

359
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,840
-  Oh, sorry !

360
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,440
Oh. I'm really, really sorry.

361
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,880
That was
an-an-an ac-ac-accident.

362
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,400
- Hey, let go of me !
- I'll show ya who's tough !

363
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,440
- And stay out !
- Tough bugs !

364
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,040
- I knew an old lady
who swallowed a fly--
- Wow !

365
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,960
- Move it !
- Whoa !

366
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,960
Hey, waiter ! I'm in my soup !

367
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,320
I've been working out.
Feel my wing.

368
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,800
Yo !
Two Black Flags over here !

369
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,600
- All right.
- Hair of the dog you bit.

370
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,120
Hey, who ordered
the pu-pu platter ?

371
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,640
Here ya go, slick. Enjoy.

372
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,640
Ow ! Aah !
Hey, I said no salt !

373
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,120
Pardon me, sir.
I represent a colony of ants,

374
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,960
and I'm looking for tough bugs,
you know, mean bugs--

375
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,880
Fired by a flea--
how humiliating !

376
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,840
Let's face it: We stink.

377
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,720
- You fired !
- You fired !

378
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,280
- Oh, will you shut up ?
- You fired !

379
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,280
Someday I will be
a beautiful butterfly,

380
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,560
and then everything
will be better.

381
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,560
I can't believe the troupe is
breaking up. We've always been together.

382
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,600
- Farewell, my friends.
- To the audience we'll never have.

383
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,400
Francis ! Your boyfriends
from the circus are here !

384
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,320
-
- There she is.

385
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,840
- Hello there, girly bug.
- Shoo, fly. Don't bother me.

386
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,880
Say, why don't you
tell our pal, Thud,

387
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,120
- what you said to us at the circus.
- Yeah.

388
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,680
- Something about buzzing
around a dung heap ?

389
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,640
Excuse me. Hi. I represent
an ant colony, and we're--

390
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,160
Hey, bartender !
Bloody Mary, O-positive.

391
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,080
Aha !

392
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,280
-
- Sir ?

393
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,240
Ladybug, ladybug
fly away home

394
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,560
-
- Not so tough now, are you ?

395
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,640
All right, clown.
Get up and fight like a girl.

396
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,080
- Get ready to do the Robin Hood act.
- I want to be Little John !

397
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,720
- What part can I play ?
- You see, I'm looking for
tough, warrior bugs.

398
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,920
Stand back, ye flies! We are
the greatest warriors in all bugdom!

399
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,720
- Warrior bugs !
- My sword !

400
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,640
Swish, swish. Clang, clang.

401
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,560
- Little John ?
- What ho, Robin ?

402
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,080
Justice is my sword
and truth shall be my quiver !

403
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,240
Wait, wait ! No, no !
I want to watch this !

404
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,480
- Jawohl !
- Thrust, parry, lunge !

405
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,720
-
- Me think it's not working !

406
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,080
- Schnell ! Schnell !
- What's going on in there ?

407
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,120
Help ! Help ! Get me out !

408
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,360
Wow.

409
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,720
- Oh, ow-ow-ow-ow.
- You're perfect !

410
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,800
Oh, great ones ! I have been scouting
for bugs with your exact talents !

411
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,640
-  A talent scout.
- My colony's in trouble.

412
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,480
Grasshoppers are coming ! We've
been forced to prepare all this food.

413
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,560
- Dinner theater !
- Food ?

414
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,600
Please !
Will you help us ?

415
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,920
- Where are they ?

416
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,760
- We'll take the job !
- Really ?
- Yes, yes, yes !

417
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,200
You can explain
the details on the way.

418
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,640
Hey !

419
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,080
- Okay, come on, everyone. Break a leg !
- Whoa, you're vicious !

420
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,000
Hold on, Mr. Ant.

421
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:09,000
Amazing !
This is too good to be true !

422
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,920
Ooh !

423
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,240
So, you see, it was my fault
that Hopper's coming back.

424
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,440
But then, Princess Atta--
boy, is she one in a million--

425
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,360
she let me go out and find you.

426
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,800
And after seeing you
fight off those flies--

427
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,840
Boy, are those grasshoppers
in for a surprise !

428
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,320
- Dr. Flora !
- Oh, dear. Not another one.

429
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,240
- This is insane.
- Insane.

430
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,600
There's just not enough
food left on the island !

431
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,160
No way we can make double quota
before Hopper comes.

432
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,080
Well, we have to try, Thorny.
We don't have any choice.

433
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,120
Yeah, I know.

434
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,480
Hey, look who's playing
lookout again-- little Speck !

435
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:31,760
- The name is Dot.
- Well, Spot, still looking for Flik ?

436
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,880
Forget it, Dot.
That loser's never coming back.

437
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,240
Flik !
He did it ! He did it !

438
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,000
What ? Quit shoving !

439
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,680
This is it !
This is Ant Island !

440
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,480
Flik ! Over here !
Flik ! Flik !

441
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,720
- Hey !
- He did it ! He did it ! Yea !

442
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,080
- He did it !
- Cool !

443
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,520
At the rate these leaves are dropping,
we're gonna need a miracle.

444
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,640
That's right !
We need a miracle !

445
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,080
- Run for your lives !

446
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,120
Ta-da !

447
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:30,640
Once again,
our reputation precedes us.

448
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,080
Hey, everybody !
Hey ! I'm back !

449
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:38,520
Hey, guys ! Hey-ey !
Look-look-look who's here with me !

450
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:43,400
Flik ! Flik ! Flik ! You're back !
I knew you could do it !

451
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,040
- Flik ?
- It's Flik !

452
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,000
- Flik has returned !
- He's back ?

453
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,120
And he's accompanied
by savage insects !

454
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,720
What ? How ? He wasn't supposed
to actually find someone !

455
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,120
Oh, look at this.
This is great. Look.

456
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,480
- Oh, my ticker !
- So, what are you supposed to be ?

457
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,000
He's a stick, stupid.
You hit bugs with him.

458
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,840
- Well, that's an oversimplification.
- That's right, kids. Like this !

459
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,760
- No ! Put me down !
- Ow !

460
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,880
- Hey !
- My, you just pop
right open there, dontcha ?

461
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,160
- Ooh ! Wow !
- Uh-oh. Kids, He's kinda ticklish.

462
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,720
-
- Let's come on out. Careful.

463
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,520
- Aphie and I are very impressed.

464
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,040
Princess Atta! Hey, guys, Princess Atta!
She's the one that sent me to find you!

465
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,480
- Did you see that
really big bug over there ?
- He looks absolutely ferocious !

466
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,080
- They're our ticket out of this mess !
- They came just in time !

467
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,280
So, Princess Atta,
what do you think ?

468
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,200
No-no-no, wait !
This was not supposed to happen.

469
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,560
Mayday, Mayday.
We're losing the job.

470
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,480
We don't fight grasshoppers.

471
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,280
- We don't, but they will.
- Bingo !

472
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,880
We gotta sweeten the deal.

473
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,000
Your Majesty,
ladies and gentlemen,

474
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,640
boys and girls of all ages,

475
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,280
our troupe here guarantees
a performance like no other !

476
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,200
Why, when your grasshopper friends
get here, we are gonna...

477
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,000
knock them dead !

478
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,280
Boy, these folks are sure
hard up for entertainment.

479
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,920
Come on, come on. Hurry !

480
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,680
Wow !

481
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,920
Honey, relax.
You should be proud of yourself.

482
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,680
- Your instincts on that boy
were right on the money.

483
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,640
And to make our official
welcome complete-- Mr. Soil ?

484
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,560
- Yes, Your Highness ?
- He's our resident thespian.

485
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,240
Last year he played the lead
in Picnic.

486
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,200
The children-- and myself--
have quickly put together...

487
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,080
a little presentation
in honor of our guests.

488
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,880
Dot, Reed, Daisy, Grub ?

489
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,160
Oh, aren't they adorable !
Ooh, they're cute !

490
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,760
The South Tunnel Elementary School
second grade class...

491
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:42,280
would like to present you with this,
a mural we have drawn...

492
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,080
of you bugs helping us
fight the grasshoppers away.

493
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,360
Oh, look at the beautiful colors
of the blood.

494
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,800
We drew one of you dying because our
teacher said it would be more dramatic.

495
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,480
- I tell you a tale of heroes so bold,

496
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,320
who vanquished our
grasshopper enemies of old.

497
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,640
Look, the last leaf has fallen.

498
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,760
We are the grasshoppers !
Where's our food ?

499
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,840
Who will come
to save us poor ants ?

500
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,920
We are the warriors,
here to defend you !

501
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,680
I die ! Die ! Die !

502
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,360
-
- Thank you, thank you ! Oh, thank you !

503
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,080
- Hey, hey, hey !
- I say we go.

504
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,840
- Okay, honey. You're up.
- Oh. Um--

505
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,800
- Oh, oh, I-I--
- We're all very grateful to have...

506
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,200
- Here, here.
- the warriors--

507
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,080
Thanks.

508
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,200
- I'd like to thank the warriors
for helping us in our fight...

509
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,200
against the grasshoppers.

510
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,240
Secondly, I would like
to thank Flik...

511
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,840
- for his forthright thinking--
- Thank you, Your Highness.

512
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,960
Oh, sure, I'd like to take credit for
all of this, but that wouldn't be right.

513
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,200
Because it was you, Princess Atta.
You believed in me--

514
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,200
- Tell that ant that we need
to talk to him right now.
- Okay, okay.

515
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,560
I know I've made mistakes in the past,
and I hope that this will make up--

516
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,720
- Flik !
- Not right now, Rosie.
I'm making a speech.

517
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,920
Now, I truly believe these bugs
are the answer to our--

518
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,160
No, there's no circus around here.
So, I--

519
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,040
Your Highness, the warriors
have called for a secret meeting
to plan for a circus--

520
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,200
circumventing the oncoming hordes so
they can trapeze-- trap them with ease !

521
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,640
- Shouldn't I come too ?
- No !

522
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:45,000
No, classified in the D.M.Z.
Gotta go A.S.A.P. You know,
strictly B.Y.O.B. Bye !

523
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,080
Sorry. Sorry I have to take
the warriors away so early,

524
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,720
but you know they have a lot to get
done, with the battle looming and all.

525
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,080
So, uh, please,
everyone enjoy the party.

526
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,840
"B.Y.O.B." ?

527
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,160
Thanks again. Bye. Bye-bye.

528
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,240
Okay, just--
just get in there. Go !

529
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,160
Go ! Go, go, go !

530
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,120
Circus bugs ?
How can you be circus bugs ?

531
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,040
- What ?
- Hey, hey, hey.

532
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,720
- You said nothing about killing
grasshoppers. You lied to us !
- Ja !

533
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,800
Are you kidding ?
Do you know what this is ?

534
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,240
This, my friends,
is false advertising.

535
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:22,240
How dare you ! You, sir,
are the charlatan in this scenario--

536
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,480
touting your wares
as a talent scout,

537
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,200
preying upon the hungry souls
of hapless artistes.

538
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,120
Good day to you, sir.

539
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,360
Wait ! No, no !
Wait, wait, wait, wait ! You can't go.

540
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,000
You have got to help me. Give me
some time, I'll come up with a plan.

541
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,320
- Just go tell them the truth !
- They can't know the truth.
The truth, you see, is bad.

542
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,240
I will be branded for life.
My children's children will
walk down the street,

543
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,080
people will point and say, "Look ! There
goes the spawn of Flik, the loser !"

544
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,800
Oh-- oh, you know, all right, fine.
Yeah, okay. Just go.

545
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,400
But if you could just do me
a little favor before you leave.

546
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,120
If you could squish me,
that would be great, because, uh,

547
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,040
when they find out,
I'm as good as dead.

548
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,920
- Flik !
-

549
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,240
I really do think I should be
part of this meeting. Flik !

550
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,080
Aah ! Princess Atta !
What a nice... surprise.

551
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,000
Just what exactly is going on ?

552
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,760
I would like to speak
with the so-called "warriors."

553
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,800
You can't ! They are in the middle
of a top secret meeting right now,

554
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,760
and they really should not
be disturbed... now.

555
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,800
Right, guys ?

556
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,040
Could you ex-- pl--
Could you excuse me, please ?

557
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,320
- Wait, wait, wait ! Please, don't go !
- I'm not going anywhere.

558
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,360
What is going on ? Flik ?

559
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,200
Flik !
Ooh, I knew it !

560
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,280
Wait ! Wait,
wait, wait, wait ! Please ! Don't go !

561
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,320
- No !
- Quick, he's losing it !

562
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,000
- You can't go ! I'm desperate !
- Really ? I couldn't tell.

563
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,200
Hmm. Come on, wings.

564
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,720
Mother,
Flik is up to something.

565
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,360
Okay, Flik, time to put ya down.
Get him off me !

566
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,520
He's cutting off the circulation.

567
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,760
- No, no, no, no !
- Let go !

568
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,200
- Please, please, don't go !
- Put the stick down.
Flik, I mean it, now.

569
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,200
- Drop the stick.
-  Run !

570
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,640
Boy, he runs fast
for a little guy.

571
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,120
- Tweet-tweet ! Tweet-tweet !

572
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,400
This way.

573
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,600
- There they are.

574
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,880
-  A bird !
-  Flik !

575
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,360
- Look !
- Dot !
-

576
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,280
Flik !

577
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,720
- Dot !
- My baby !

578
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,880
I gotcha, I gotcha !

579
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,440
-
- Oww !

580
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,400
Oooh.

581
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,240
- I can't see !
- Somebody do something !

582
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,320
- Are they all right ?
- Did anyone see ?
- What is happening ?

583
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,960
- Dot ?
- Good heavens, they're in trouble !

584
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,200
- Francis, Francis, Francis,
Francis, Francis, Francis--
- Oh, you guys, I've got an idea !

585
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,040
Here ! I've got it !

586
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,320
Please, ma'am, wake up !
Wake up !

587
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,280
- Help ! Help !
- Yoo-hoo !

588
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:33,360
Mr. Early Bird ! How about
a nice, tasty worm on a stick ?

589
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,000
I'm going to snap.
I'm going to snap.

590
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,160
Nice and juicy, succulent--

591
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,400
- There they are !
- Flik ! Help !

592
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,440
Okay.

593
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,880
- Flik !
- It's going to be okay, Dot.

594
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,640
Ooh-hoo-hoo !
Bye-bye, birdie !

595
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,680
Help ! I'm stuck !

596
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,480
Pull me down !
Schnell, schnell, schnell !

597
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,520
- The caterpillar's using
himself as live bait !
- How brave !

598
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,440
-
- Suck it in, man !

599
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,840
Ow. My leg !

600
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,920
The bird !
Look out for the bird !

601
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,520
- Flik !
-

602
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,920
- Up-a, up-a !
-

603
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,040
- What is that ?

604
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:09,200
That, my friends,
is the sound of applause !

605
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,040
Applause-- I'm in heaven !

606
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,040
Our Blueberry troop salutes you bugs
for rescuing our smallest member,

607
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,960
Princess Dot.

608
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,440
And as a tribute to Miss Francis,
we've changed out bandannas !

609
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,920
We voted you
our honorary den mother !

610
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,240
- What ? Great.

611
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,960
-
- All right, girls. Let's move
your keisters outta here now.

612
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,560
The patient needs her rest,
you know. Come on.

613
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,480
Excuse, me, Flik.
Can I talk to you for a second ?

614
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,320
- Huh ? Oh, sure.
- Oww !

615
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,280
Again, thank you all,
very, very much.

616
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,320
- Oh, stop it.
- You're too kind.
- Thank you.

617
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,720
You don't think I've offended
the warriors, do you ?

618
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,640
You ? No.

619
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,880
Oh, good. Because, you see,

620
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,200
when you first brought them here,
I thought you'd hired a bunch of clowns.

621
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,200
Ya did ?

622
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,120
Don't tell 'em I said that.

623
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,360
Boy, that's all I'd need,
another royal blunder like that.

624
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,760
- Princess, you're doing a great job.
- Thanks, you're sweet.

625
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,360
You're wrong, but sweet.

626
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,960
- I know what everyone really thinks.
- I don't follow you.

627
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:31,280
Everyone-- the whole colony. Nobody
really believes I can do this job.

628
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,920
It's like they're all watching me,

629
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,080
- just, just--
- Waiting for you to screw up.

630
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,320
- Flik, I owe you an apology.
- For what ?

631
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,200
Well, I haven't been that nice
to you, and... I'm sorry.

632
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,160
If there's any way I can
make it up to you--

633
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,080
Hey ! I know !

634
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,160
How would you like to be the queen's
official aide to the warrior bugs ?

635
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,480
- Me ?
- Oh, sure. You've got
a great rapport with them,

636
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,840
especially after that rescue--
it was very brave.

637
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,120
- Really ? Naw, naw--
- Well, not every bug would face a bird.

638
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,680
- I mean, even Hopper's afraid of 'em.
- Yeah, well, I guess maybe I--

639
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,320
- Say that again ?
- I said, even Hopper's afraid of birds.

640
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,440
Thank you.

641
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,560
- Hopper's afraid of birds !
- And I don't blame them !

642
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,480
Oh, oh, oh,
this is perfect.

643
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,280
We can get rid of Hopper,
and no one has to know that I messed up.

644
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,320
You just keep pretending
you're warriors.

645
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,760
Whoa, Flik, honey. We are not
about to fight grasshoppers, okay ?

646
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,240
You'll be gone before the grasshoppers
ever arrive. Here's what we do.

647
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,160
Not another word.

648
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,760
I don't know what you're concocting
in that little ant brain of yours,

649
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,680
but we'll have no part of it.

650
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,680
Excuse me ? Could we get
the warriors' autographs ?

651
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,600
Autographs ? Ja !

652
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,920
- Wow! Great!
- So, you fellas catch the action today?

653
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Oh ! The bird went--
and it just missed you !

654
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,800
- Aren't you sweet ?
- And the way you pretended
to be stuck in that crack !

655
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,720
And then you dive-bombed
into the bush !

656
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,040
- There you go, my boy.
- Wow ! Thanks !

657
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,000
"M-M-Maa-jor--"

658
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,120
That's Major Manny, young cadet.

659
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,080
-I outrank everyone here. Remember that.
-Yes, sir !

660
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,000
- Dismissed !
- Wow !

661
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,720
- When I grow up,
I'm gonna be a praying mantis !
- I'm gonna be a stick bug !

662
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,920
Oh, they're all so cool,
I can't pick !

663
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,040
Delightful lads.
You were saying, Flik ?

664
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,080
All right.
We are going to build a bird--

665
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:33,160
a bird that we can operate
from the inside, which would then be--

666
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,000
...hoisted above the anthill
and hidden high in the tree.

667
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,920
Then, right when Hopper
and his gang are below,

668
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:44,280
we'll launch the bird
and scare off the grasshoppers.

669
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,560
Now it's going to take
everyone's involvement--

670
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,840
...to make this plan
a reality.

671
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,880
I know it's not our tradition
to do things differently,

672
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,320
but if our ancestors were able
to build this anthill,

673
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:59,680
we can certainly rally together
to build this bird !

674
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,680
- Perfect !
- Okay, hit your marks !

675
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,840
- Whoa !
- Whee-hee !

676
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,160
- Hi, Flik.
- Oh.

677
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,080
- I love what you did with your antenna.
- Oh, thank you.

678
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,000
Oh, look.
She's a natural mother.

679
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,160
All right, that's it !
Out ! Everybody out !

680
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,760
Now you're gonna cry, right ?
See if I care. Go ahead, cry.

681
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,000
-
- Please, don't cry. Please.

682
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,640
- Huh ?

683
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,640
- Ta-da !
-

684
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,600
- Okay, lower, lower--

685
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,480
- You got it. And that's it !
- Whoa !

686
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,920
Rabbit through the hole, chicken in the
barn, two by two by, there's the yarn.

687
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,840
- Done !
- Ruben Kincaid !

688
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:35,200
- Hey !
- Good job, guys ! Nice work !

689
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:42,920
Up, down.
Up, down. Up, down.

690
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,240
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

691
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,480
-
- Ah-ah-ah. Read 'em and weep.

692
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,400
- Huh ?

693
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:06,720
Whoo-whee ! Yahoo !

694
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,760
- Flik, watch out !
- Whoa !

695
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,000
- Look ! I'm a beautiful butterfly !
-

696
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:21,200
There ya go. Good job, fellas.
Keep up the good work.

697
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,920
Huh ?

698
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,920
Okay !

699
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,400
Yes !

700
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:48,000
Whoo-hoo ! Look at me !
I'm bare footing ! Whoo-hoo !

701
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,840
Yo, bugito,
dos granitos, pronto !

702
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,520
You gotta try this, man !

703
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,040
La cucaracha, la cucaracha
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da

704
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:20,080
...all the way back there
and it starts to rain, we might
as well be sucking bug spray.

705
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,560
Ooh, don't even say that !
You know something ?

706
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,040
You're making a lot of sense.
I mean, why take the risk ?

707
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,960
- You should tell Hopper.
- Good idea.

708
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,600
But, you know,
it's really not our place.

709
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,760
You're his brother.
That makes you, like...

710
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,920
the vice president of the gang.

711
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,800
Wow ! It kinda does,
doesn't it ?

712
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:41,760
Okay, I'll tell them.
I should talk to you guys more often.

713
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:45,560
- What if Hopper doesn't like it ?
- Then the genius'll get smacked
and not us.

714
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,280
Vice President Molt.

715
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,320
Ooh, yeah, that's good.
Oh, that's good.

716
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,240
- Ooh, a little lower. Ahh, lower.
- Hey ya, Hop.

717
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,000
- Go away.
- That's fine.
Then I won't tell ya my idea.

718
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,920
- Good !
- Okay, okay. I'll tell ya anyway.

719
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,160
I've been thinking-- which is something
I do, being vice president and all.

720
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,040
This is a thought, and it was mine:
Why go back to Ant Island at all ?

721
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,960
- You don't even like grain.
- What?

722
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,400
You're right. I didn't think
it was such a good idea myself.

723
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,960
It wasn't even my idea.
It was Axle and Loco's !

724
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,560
They talked fancy to me.
I got confused !

725
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:21,000
-  La cucaracha, la cucaracha

726
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,320
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da

727
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,560
Guys, order another round...

728
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,080
because we're staying here !

729
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,240
-
- Yeah !

730
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,520
What was I thinking ?
Going back to Ant Island.

731
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,440
I mean, we just got here,

732
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,720
and we have more than enough food
to get us through the winter.

733
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,640
Right ? Why go back ?

734
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:52,840
But there was that ant
that stood up to me.

735
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,520
- Yeah, but we can forget about him !
- Yeah, it was just one ant.

736
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,800
- Ooo-oooh !
- One ant !

737
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,560
Yeah, you're right !
It's just one ant !

738
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:07,280
- Yeah, boss. They're puny !
- Hmm, puny.

739
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:11,880
Say, let's pretend this grain
is a puny little ant.

740
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,640
- Didn't that hurt ?
- Nope.

741
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,040
- Well, how 'bout this one ?
- Are you kidding ?

742
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,200
-
- Well, how 'bout this ?

743
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,720
You let one ant stand up to us,

744
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,640
then they all might stand up.

745
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:43,560
Those puny little ants
outnumber us a hundred to one.

746
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:48,320
And if they ever figure that out,
there goes our way of life !

747
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:53,680
It's not about food.
It's about keeping those ants in line.

748
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,600
That's why we're going back !

749
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,720
Does anybody else wanna stay ?

750
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,880
He's quite the motivational
speaker, isn't he ?

751
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,600
Let's ride !

752
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,600
- To the bird !
- The bird !

753
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,600
Hey !

754
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,520
- Hey !
- Whoo-hoo !

755
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,400
Hey !

756
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,840
- Hey !
- Whoo !

757
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,760
- Get down, roly boys !
-

758
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,760
- How low can you go ? Sing it now.
-  How low can you go

759
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,920
-Do it, Princess.  How low can you go
-

760
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,320
And that's how my 12th husband died.

761
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,880
So, now I'm a widow. I mean,
I've always been a black widow,

762
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,320
but now I'm a black widow widow.

763
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,040
Whoo !

764
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,920
- Thorny ! Any sign of those fiends ?
- Let me check.

765
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,600
No, not yet.
But we'll be ready for 'em.

766
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,400
Blueberries, dismissed !

767
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:11,280
- And, uh, quit beating the boys up.

768
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,600
Those little raisins
do grow on ya.

769
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,680
Hey, how you guys doing ?
Some party, huh ?

770
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,600
Is that grain dip fresh or what ?

771
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,840
Okay, I've told everyone you'll be
stationed deep in the command bunker.

772
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,200
Party quiets down,
I sneak you out the back way
and then you're outta here forever.

773
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,080
Dim don't wanna go.

774
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,680
Well, if Dim stays he's gonna
need me here. He's not fully trained.

775
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,600
- I mean, house-trained.
-

776
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:39,280
I, uh, I kinda promised the Blueberries
I'd teach 'em canasta.

777
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:43,640
It seems we've been booked
for an extended engagement.

778
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:50,640
Will you look at this colony ?
Will you just look at this colony ?

779
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,840
I don't even recognize it.

780
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:59,200
Work that ab, baby !

781
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,640
And I have you bugs to thank for it.
So-- thank you !

782
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,680
And, uh, thank you
for finding 'em, Flik.

783
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,880
Me ? Oh, ooh--
uh, uh, I'll get it.

784
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,800
I mean, if you don't mind,
I'll just--

785
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,720
- It's all tangled up.

786
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,880
- There.
- Ow !

787
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,120
I think I'll go check
on the bird.

788
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,080
- Bird's this way.
-
Yeah, the bird's that way.

789
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,600
They're back !
Get ready, everybody !

790
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,000
Get to your posts !

791
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,840
Battle stations, everyone.
This not a drill.

792
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:50,480
Come on, everyone. You know your jobs !
Let's go, go, go, go !

793
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,520
-
- Look out !

794
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,840
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa there.
Steady, Girls. That's it.

795
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,800
- Oh, it's P.T.
- P.T. ?

796
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:04,240
Greetings and salutations !
Ooh-boppa-doo and how do you do ?

797
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:08,520
I am the great P.T. Flea !

798
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,640
I'm in need of your assis--
Oh, let's just cut to the chase.

799
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,960
Look, I've been going
from anthill to anthill.

800
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,160
I'm looking for a bunch of circus
performers. Have you seen 'em ?

801
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,960
Wait a second.
Ain't that Staff Sergeant Slim ?

802
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,080
No, no, no. I'm sorry, no, but uh--

803
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,000
- Be quiet !

804
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,080
Hey !

805
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,920
You'll probably--
you'll probably want to get going.

806
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,080
I guess you got a lot of other anthills
to check into, so, bye !

807
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,320
-
- Ah, guys, I've been looking
all over for ya !

808
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:41,720
- Flaming Death is a huge hit !
- P.T. ! Sh--

809
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,000
- I'm serious. Word of mouth got around.
- P.T. ! No !

810
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,440
The next day, there was a line of flies
outside the tent went on forever !

811
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,360
- It must have been a foot long !
- P.T., no !

812
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:51,640
So, I figured it out. You guys burn me
twice a night, I take a day off to heal,

813
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,560
and then we do it
all over again !

814
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,680
We'll be the top circus act
in the business !

815
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,600
You mean, you're not warriors ?

816
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:03,520
Are you kidding ? These guys are the
lousiest circus bugs you've ever seen.

817
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,880
And they're gonna make me rich !

818
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,920
You mean to tell me that
our entire defensive strategy...

819
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,320
was concocted by clowns ?

820
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,400
Hey, hey, hey, hey. We really thought
Flik's idea was gonna work.

821
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,960
- Oops.
- Tell me this isn't true.

822
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,880
- No, you don't-- You don't--
- This couldn't have happened
at a more inopportune time !

823
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,800
The last leaf is about to fall !

824
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:27,080
We haven't collected
any food for the grasshoppers !

825
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,280
If Hopper finds out
what we almost did--

826
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,320
Hopper is not going
to find out.

827
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,760
We're going to hide all this,
and pretend it never happened.

828
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,560
You bugs were never here.
So I suggest you all leave.

829
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,080
But the bird !
The-The bird will work.

830
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:46,200
I never thought I'd see the day
when an ant would put himself...

831
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,200
- before the rest of his colony.
- What ?

832
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,720
- The point is, Flik, you lied to us.
- No, no, no ! I-I--

833
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,440
You lied, Flik. You lied to her.

834
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,960
You lied to the colony !
You lied to me !

835
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,120
And like an idiot,
I believed you.

836
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:04,720
But I-I was just afraid that...

837
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:08,800
if you knew I'd gotten circus bugs--

838
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:13,200
- I just wanted to make a difference.
- I want you to leave, Flik.

839
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,560
And this time, don't come back.

840
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:29,760
Tough crowd. Yee-haw !

841
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:32,080
Flik !

842
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,840
Get those bugs !

843
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:25,680
That's it ? But there's got
to be more food on the island !

844
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,600
If we give up any more,
we'll starve.

845
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,120
- Hopper won't accept this !
-

846
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:38,160
-
- Mother, it's not enough.

847
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,560
- What do we do ?
- I-I don't know.

848
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,320
- You little termites !

849
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,080
I give you a second chance,
and this is all I get ?

850
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:20,200
-
- But Hopper, we ran out of time !

851
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,880
Have you been playing all summer ?
You think this is a game ?

852
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:27,240
- No, no, please !
- Well, guess what ?

853
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,160
You just lost.

854
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:32,720
-
- Not one ant sleeps...

855
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:36,000
until we get
every scrap of food...

856
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,360
on this island !

857
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,280
Just do what he says. You don't
want to make him mad. Believe me !

858
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,040
No, no, no.
You're staying with me, Your Highness.

859
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,000
-
- What do you think you're doing ?

860
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:51,600
- Get over there.
- Quick ! To the clubhouse.

861
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,280
-  Hurry !

862
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,080
- Shh !
Shut up a minute, will ya ?

863
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:13,320
- I think I heard something over here.
- Have you checked over there ?

864
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:17,160
- No, not yet.
- Then get over there and check it out!

865
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,240
- Wait a minute.
-

866
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,440
- Hey, I think I found something.

867
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,720
Like an idiot.

868
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,640
Oh, I don't know, maybe
it'll keep me dry in the rain.

869
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,560
You moron, we'll be out of here
before it rains.

870
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,440
Didn't you hear Hopper ?
After the ants pick all the food,

871
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,680
he's gonna squish the queen
to remind 'em who's boss.

872
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:42,440
Then she's dead. They cry-- boo-hoo--
we go home. End of story.

873
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:45,640
Oh ! Cool. I love our job.

874
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,600
Stay here.
I'm gonna get help.

875
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:34,240
Come on, wings, fly. Fly !

876
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,360
Yeah ! Whoa-oh !

877
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,400
I'm gonna be
rich, rich, rich

878
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,360
I'm gonna be rich, rich, rich
I'm gonna be the richest flea
in the land

879
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:16,120
Ka-ching !  The streets'll
be paved with golden retrievers

880
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,440
I'm rich, rich, rich
That's who I am

881
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,680
- Poor fellow.
- Hey, maybe we can cheer him up a bit.

882
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:31,000
Don't worry, Flik.
The circus life isn't so bad.

883
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:33,600
- Yes, you can be part of our act.
- Here ! Like this.

884
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:38,040
Oof ! Ahh.
Slapstick ! Get it ?

885
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:42,320
I-I'm a walking stick.
Oh, never mind.

886
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,240
- Flik !
- Dot ?

887
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:47,120
Flik, wait ! Wait !

888
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,200
Dot, you're flying !
What are you doing here ?

889
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,320
Hopper moved into the anthill,

890
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,320
and his gang's eating everything !

891
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,280
- Oh, no !
- Good heavens !

892
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,600
And I heard a grasshopper say
that when they're finished,

893
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,680
Hopper's gonna squish my mom !

894
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,240
- Oh, not the queen !
- Do something !
- How ?

895
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:08,360
-  Come on, you guys, think !
- I know. The bird.

896
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,400
- Yes, of course.
- The bird ! That's brilliant.

897
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,880
- Ja !
- The bird won't work.

898
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,240
- What are you talking about ?
It was your idea.
- But you said that everything--

899
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:18,800
Forget everything I ever told you.
All right, Dot ?

900
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,960
Let's face it. The colony is right.
I just make things worse.

901
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,080
That bird is a guaranteed failure.

902
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:32,640
You listen to me, my boy. I've made
a living out of being a failure.

903
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,760
And you, sir, are not a failure !

904
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,800
- Oh, but Flik, you've
done so many good things.
- Oh, yeah ?

905
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,720
Okay, show me one thing
I've done right.

906
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:43,480
- Umm--
- Us.

907
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,920
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Dim is right, my boy.

908
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,760
You have rekindled the long-dormant
embers of purpose in our lives.

909
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:54,600
And if it wasn't for you,
Francis would have never gotten
in touch with his feminine side.

910
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,680
Oh yeah ? Well-- Hmm.

911
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:01,160
Lieutenant Gypsy
reporting for duty.

912
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:05,000
- Kid, say the word
and we'll follow you into battle.
- We believe in you, my boy.

913
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:06,960
Flik, please ?

914
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,640
Pretend it's a seed, okay ?

915
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,800
- Hey, what's with the rock ?
- Must be an ant thing.

916
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,440
All right, let's do it.

917
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,360
- That's the Flik we know and love.

918
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,360
- We're on !
- So, what do we do first ?

919
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:59,720
Bugs will pay
big bucks to see

920
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,600
A bonfire that is starring me

921
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,720
P.T., look. Money !

922
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,560
Where ? Where ?

923
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:14,000
All right. Get moving ! Get going.
Move your abdomens, now !

924
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,000
-
- Hey ! Turn your butt off.

925
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,800
Psst ! Hey, guys !
Get me out of this thing, will ya ?

926
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,720
I promise to start thinking
about paying ya.

927
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,360
Hey ! Wait, wait !
Okay, I'll pay ya ! I'll pay ya !

928
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,560
Oh, no !
They've finished collecting the food.

929
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,720
We've got to get the queen now.

930
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:35,320
Once she's safe,
we move on Gypsy's signal.

931
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,560
-  Someone's coming !

932
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,880
Hello, kids ! Ready to make
some grasshoppers cry ?

933
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,800
It's payback time,
Blueberry-style.

934
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:52,720
-
- Blueberries rock !

935
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:54,440
-
- All right !

936
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:00,160
Ladies and Gentlebugs !
Larvae of all stages !

937
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:04,400
Rub your legs together for
the world's greatest bug circus !

938
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,840
- Wait a minute.

939
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,040
- I think I'm going to wet myself.
- Steady--

940
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,960
- What's going on here ?
- Well, uh--

941
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,880
Uh, yes.

942
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:28,440
We were invited
by Princess Atta...

943
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:31,720
as a surprise for your arrival.

944
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,720
- Squish 'em.
-

945
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,040
Ooh--

946
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:42,080
Hey !

947
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,880
Now that's funny.

948
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,720
That is funny.

949
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:59,040
I guess we could use
a little entertainment.

950
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:02,040
Looks like you did something right
for once, Princess.

951
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:05,920
- On with the show!
-Hi-ya !

952
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Hey!

953
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:11,000
The circus, the circus
I love the circus

954
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,560
- Ba-ba all gone !

955
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:27,800
Baby wants pie !

956
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:31,600
Pie ? He asked for it.
Should I give it to him ?

957
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,600
Yeah ! Give 'em pie !
Give 'em pie !

958
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,880
-
- Yeah ! Hah !

959
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,960
Thank you, gentlemen.
Always an intellectual treat.

960
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,600
Say, how many roaches does it take
to screw in a light bulb ?

961
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:44,000
Can't tell. As soon as
the light goes on, they scatter !

962
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,040
Ah, almost there.

963
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:03,600
>From the most mysterious
regions of uncharted Asia,

964
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:06,200
- I give you the Chinese Cabinet...
- Come on, Girls. Quick. Quick.

965
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:09,280
of Metamorphosis !

966
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,800
Utilizing psychic vibrations,

967
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:15,400
-  Ooh, ohh, pick me !
- I shall select the perfect volunteer.

968
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:18,080
Ooh, no ! Come on,
I'm asking ya with my brain.

969
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:21,920
- Aha! Why, Your Majesty!
- Me?

970
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,560
-
- No, no. Thumper, down. Let her go.

971
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,480
Maybe he'll saw her in half.

972
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:30,120
As you ascend the dung beetle
to the unknown,

973
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:34,160
put your trust in the mysteries that
are beyond mere mortal comprehension.

974
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,880
Ooh, this is gonna be good !

975
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,480
- Blueberries ready ?
-  Ready.

976
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:43,000
- Ready !
- Shh !

977
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:46,000
I call upon the ancient
Szechwan spirits...

978
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,040
to inhabit the body
of our volunteer !

979
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,440
No, no.
Just stay in there, Your Majesty.

980
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,680
Transformation.

981
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:56,120
Transformation !

982
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,200
Transformation !

983
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,400
Wow.
Manny's getting good.

984
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:03,760
-  Not now.
- If it rains, that bird'll
get ripped to shreds !

985
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,680
Shh !

986
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:11,760
And now, insectus...

987
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:15,040
transformitus !

988
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:22,960
- Ooh !
- Ooh, pretty !

989
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:26,520
- Thank you, thank you.

990
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:29,400
- Thank you.
- That's the signal. That's the signal !

991
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,040
This is it, Girls.
Get ready to roll.

992
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,960
- Huh ? It's stuck !
- That was amazing !

993
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,800
I have no-- How did they do that ?
I have no idea where she went.

994
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,320
- Thank you. Thank you, thank you.
- More, more, more !

995
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:49,080
Wait !

996
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,920
- Where is she ?
- Well, now, uh, actually--

997
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:55,680
I am sorry. A magician
never reveals his secrets.

998
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,520
That's very true, Hoppy. Where would the
mystery be if we all knew how it was--

999
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:01,000
- Shutting up.
-

1000
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:04,200
- You can do it !
You've got to make it work !
- Hey !

1001
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,520
I said, where is she ?

1002
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,720
-
- Ohh !

1003
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,760
Hold on !

1004
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:30,040
Bird ! It's a bird !

1005
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:50,440
-
- Let's get out of here ! Go !

1006
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:58,520
Don't let it get me !
Don't let it get me !

1007
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,440
Help me ! Aaah !

1008
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,400
Up, down, up, down.

1009
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,240
- And turn !
-

1010
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:20,440
- Oh, my eye ! Help me !
-

1011
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,200
Mmm, boysenberry.

1012
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:31,120
Huh ?
Aah, no, no, no, no, no !

1013
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:39,480
-
-  Oh, the pain !

1014
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,880
There goes my magic act !

1015
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:45,800
- Flaming gas !
- No ! P.T. !

1016
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,280
A direct hit ! Ah-hee-ha !

1017
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,200
-
- Run !

1018
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,720
-
- Flik ! Help us !

1019
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,200
Where's Dot ?
Anyone seen Dot ?

1020
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:33,040
-
- Whose idea was this ?

1021
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:34,920
Huh ?

1022
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,480
Was it yours, Princess ?

1023
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:41,120
Just get behind me, Girls.
It'll be okay.

1024
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:46,960
The bird was my idea.
I'm the one you want.

1025
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,560
- Ohh.
-

1026
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:07,640
Where do you get the gall
to do this to me ?

1027
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:11,360
You were--
You were gonna squish the queen.

1028
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,920
- It's true.

1029
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,600
I hate it when someone
gives away the ending.

1030
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,840
You piece of dirt !
No, I'm wrong.

1031
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,760
You're lower than dirt.
You're an ant !

1032
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:29,240
Let this be a lesson
to all you ants.

1033
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:32,360
Ideas are very dangerous things.

1034
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:35,760
You are mindless,
soil-shoving losers,

1035
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:39,640
put on this earth to serve us !

1036
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:53,280
Ants are not meant
to serve grasshoppers !

1037
01:15:56,920 --> 01:16:00,040
I've seen these ants
do great things.

1038
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:02,480
And year after year,
they somehow manage...

1039
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,960
to pick food
for themselves and you.

1040
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,920
So-So who is the weaker species ?

1041
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,320
Ants don't serve grasshoppers.

1042
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,080
It's you who need us.

1043
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:25,440
We're a lot stronger
than you say we are.

1044
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,640
And you know it, don't you ?

1045
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:43,080
Umm, Hopper ?
I hate to interrupt, but, um--

1046
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:51,320
You ants stay back !

1047
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:59,880
- Oh, this was such a bad idea !
- You see, Hopper,

1048
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:02,560
nature has a certain order.

1049
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:06,560
The ants pick the food,
the ants keep the food,

1050
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,720
and the grasshoppers leave !

1051
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:17,120
- I'm so proud of you, Flik !
- Charge-a !

1052
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,280
Where are you going ?
They're just ants !

1053
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,320
Oof !

1054
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:27,280
No ! Bad grasshopper !
Bad grasshopper ! Go home !

1055
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,360
-
- Yeah !

1056
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,840
Come back here,
you cowards ! Don't leave !

1057
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,960
-  To the cannon !
-  To the cannon !

1058
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:42,560
No !

1059
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,920
Happy landings, Hopper !

1060
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,840
- Huh ?

1061
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:06,400
Rain !

1062
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,200
- Flik !
- Quick ! After them !

1063
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:36,520
- Yaah !
- Aah ! Aah !

1064
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,680
Aah ! Slim !

1065
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,080
- Francis! Francis! Francis, I'm stuck!
- Where are ya?

1066
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:52,000
- I'm over here ! Here !
- Where ?

1067
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,280
I'm the only stick with eyeballs !

1068
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,920
- Help ! Help !
- Get him !

1069
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:09,320
- Yes ! Yes !

1070
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:13,920
No !

1071
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:30,040
- Go that way ! I've got an idea !
- But the anthill's over--

1072
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,120
- Flik !
- Come on !

1073
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:49,600
Come on !
We've gotta hide !

1074
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:52,440
No matter what happens,
stay down !

1075
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,360
Flik, no !
What are you doing ?

1076
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,720
- Uh-- Hopper !
- You think it's over ?

1077
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,680
No, no, no.
No, I-I can explain.

1078
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:04,000
- All your little stunt did
was buy them time !
- No, please !

1079
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,480
Please, Hopper !

1080
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:08,400
I'll get more grasshoppers
and be back next season,

1081
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,640
but you won't !

1082
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,120
- Well, what's this ?

1083
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,520
Another one of
your little bird tricks ?

1084
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,880
- Yup.
- Are there a bunch of little
Girls in this one too ?

1085
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,280
- Hello, Girls !
-

1086
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,960
No ! No !
No, no, no, no !

1087
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:39,200
No ! Aah !
No !

1088
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:42,040
Oh, no !

1089
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:46,320
Oh, no ! No, no, no !

1090
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,560
Come on, boys !

1091
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,960
- Hey, Princess Dot ! Wait up !
-

1092
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,840
and I gotta get out of my chair.

1093
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:10,880
- Come on ! You can rub lotion
on me later, shade boy.
- Yeah, hubba-hubba.

1094
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:16,720
- Oh, thank you !

1095
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,960
- Oh, you're too kind !
- It was the least we could do.
All in a day's work.

1096
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,920
Dim !

1097
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,080
- Ohh !
- Ohh !

1098
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,440
I'm so sorry, kids.
I wish you could come along too.

1099
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,880
- I'm not gonna cry. I'm not gonna cry.

1100
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,200
Hey, let's go. We got a schedule
to keep. Come on, let's go.

1101
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:40,400
- Hup, hup, hey !
- Hey, Tiny !
Let's get this show packed up !

1102
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,360
We got paying customers hatching !

1103
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,600
Yes, Mr. Flea. Yes, sir.
Of course, sir. Right away, sir.

1104
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:46,520
And, um, I just wanted to
thank you for giving me a chance,

1105
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,960
because it's an honor to work
with creative giants such as yourself.

1106
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:52,400
- Shutting up.
- You sure you can't
come on tour with us ?

1107
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:56,880
- Sorry. My place is here.
- Good answer.

1108
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,000
Oh, well. Your loss.
One minute, insects !

1109
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:03,480
I wanna thank all of you...

1110
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:07,960
for giving us back our hope,
our dignity, and our lives.

1111
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:12,000
And to you, Princess Atta.
You have given us so much.

1112
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:15,080
Please accept this gift
from us bugs...

1113
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:17,760
to you ants.

1114
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:22,640
- For you !
- Oh ! It's a rock.

1115
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:25,080
-
- What's with the rock ?

1116
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:27,000
Must be a circus thing.

1117
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:31,520
Well, Flik, you really goofed up.

1118
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:35,360
- Thanks.
- Yeah, you too.

1119
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:14,520
- All right.
Now it's getting mushy.

1120
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:17,680
- We're outta here ! Hy-aah !

1121
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:26,720
- Whoa !
-  See ya next season !

1122
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:29,200
- See ya, Flik !
- Bye ! We miss you already !

1123
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:32,480
- You fired !
-  We forgot Heimlich !

1124
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:40,640
I'm finished ! Finally,
I'm a beautiful butterfly !

1125
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:50,000
Mein wings !
Oh, they're beautiful !

1126
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:53,160
Heimlich ! The wagon's
taking off ! You better start flying !

1127
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:58,560
But I am flying ! And from way up here,
you all look like little ants !

1128
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:01,120
Auf Wiedersehen !

1129
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,920
Bye !

1130
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:12,440
Present stalks !

1131
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:15,480
Harvester, salute !

1132
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:59,360
Was a bug, little bug

1133
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,480
Hardly there

1134
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,680
How he felt, what he dreamed

1135
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,600
Who would care

1136
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:14,560
-  Without any evidence
-  His flaws were many, ooh

1137
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:18,480
-  He was full of confidence
-  Some people haven't any

1138
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:22,160
-  Didn't have much common sense
-  It's highly overrated

1139
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:25,200
He just knew
that he'd come through

1140
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:28,440
It's the time of your life

1141
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,920
So live it well

1142
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:35,560
It's the time of your life

1143
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:37,960
So live it well

1144
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:44,680
We may only go round one time

1145
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:47,400
As far as I can tell

1146
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:50,600
It's the time of your life

1147
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:53,000
So live it well

1148
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:57,640
We may only go round
this one time

1149
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:01,280
-  As far as I can tell
-  He could be wrong about me

1150
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:04,320
-  It's the time of your life
-  Time, life

1151
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,960
-  It's the time of your life
-  Time, life

1152
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:10,920
It's the time of your life

1153
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,360
So live it well

1154
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:16,280
- Speed !
- Marker.

1155
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:19,480
- And-- action !
- Are you saying I'm stupid ?

1156
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:22,720
- No !
- Do I look stupid... to you ?

1157
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:26,760
- I'm sorry !

1158
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:30,240
- Are you saying I'm stupid ? Oh--
-

1159
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,800
- I'm sorry ! I got it.
No, no. Do it again. I'm fine.

1160
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:40,680
- Are you saying I'm stupid ?
- Yes !

1161
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:44,400
This is the 15th take.
I cannot work like this.

1162
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,680
- I will be in my trailer.
- I need a break.

1163
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,600
- Marker.

1164
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:52,800
-Whoa, Flik honey, we are not about to--

1165
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,720
- Is someone hammering ?
-

1166
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,640
-Could we hold the work, please? People?

1167
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:58,560
Am I in this shot ?
You can see me, right ?

1168
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:01,080
-
- And-- action !

1169
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:04,000
To infinity, and beyond !

1170
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:08,120
-
- I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

1171
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:10,040
Really, can you blame me ?

1172
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:13,400
- Okay, let's go for real now. Sorry.
- Okay, cut !

1173
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:15,960
Why go back to Ant Island at all ?

1174
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:17,920
- I mean, you don't even like grain.
- What ?

1175
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,840
You're right. I didn't think
it was such a good idea myself.

1176
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:21,880
- Actually, it wasn't
even my idea. It was--
- Watch it !

1177
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:24,240
-
- I'm sorry ! I'm sorry !
Is the camera broke ?

1178
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:26,920
Oh, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry. Did I ruin the take ?

1179
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,240
-
- And thank you for finding 'em, Flik.

1180
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:32,280
Me ? Oh, oops, ow, ow.

1181
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:34,320
- Ow, ow, ow !
- Uh, oh, oh no. Oh no, oh--

1182
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:37,160
- This really hurts, guys.
Can we cut ? Ow !
- I'm sorry, I'm s-- Oh !

1183
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:41,880
So, is there a Mrs. Ant
you have to tunnel home to ?

1184
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:45,280
Oh, I'm sorry !
I thought he was real.

1185
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:48,840
Ooh, dear.
Put that thing in my car.

1186
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:50,880
-
- Marker.

1187
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:53,200
Flik, after much deliberation--

1188
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:59,640
-
- Ohh, I-- Ow. Oh. My eye !

1189
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:02,240
Oh. No, no. Seriously,
I've got berry juice in my eye !

1190
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:05,040
- It stings ! Stop acting. I'm serious.

1191
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:06,920
- Oh, stop the camera !
-

1192
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:11,600
Uh-oh. Towel !
I need a towel over here !

1193
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:15,400
- Cut !

1194
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:18,680
-
-  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1195
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:22,520
- Can we-- Can we cut ? It's just
I don't think I'm coming across.

1196
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,720
Hmm. Oh, oh, I know. I know.
I could lather up a bunch of spit.

1197
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,560
Ooh, ooh, that's good.
I got it, J.L. One more for me.

1198
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:30,520
-
- Speed !
- Marker !

1199
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,000
Action !

1200
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,680
Spinning a web of safety
in less than 50-- Bleh !

1201
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:37,720
It's the time of your life

1202
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:39,640
So live it well

1203
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:44,920
It's the time of your life

1204
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,880
So live it well

1205
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:54,040
We may only go round one time

1206
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:56,800
As far as I can tell

1207
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:59,920
It's the time of your life

1208
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
So live it well

1209
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:07,960
Like us all he started small

1210
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:09,880
Then he grew

1211
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:15,400
When the time came he knew

1212
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:17,360
What to do

1213
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:23,360
-  He knew in order to succeed
-  They'd have to work together

1214
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:27,040
-  He turned a rock into a seed
-  And they were changed forever

1215
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,320
Then they had the strength
they'd need

1216
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:33,960
-  To get through stormy weather
-  Do or die, you gotta try

1217
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,000
It's the time of your life

1218
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:38,960
So live it well

1219
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:44,200
It's the time of your life

1220
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,120
So live it well

1221
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:53,400
You may only go round one time

1222
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:56,360
-  As far as I can tell
-  You may be wrong about me

1223
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:59,400
It's the time of your life

1224
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:02,320
So live it well

1225
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:05,920
Isn't it a bit surprising

1226
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:09,600
How our fortunes ebb and flow

1227
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:13,400
And only to the enterprising

1228
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:17,640
Does the magic fortune cookie go

1229
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:21,560
Believe me
It's the time of your life

1230
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:23,520
So live it well

1231
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:28,280
It's the time of your life

1232
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:28,800
It's the time of your life

1233
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:30,920
So live it well

1234
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:37,920
We may only go round one time

1235
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:40,640
As far as I can tell

1236
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:43,280
It's the time of your life

1237
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:44,280
It's the time of your life

1238
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:48,040
It's the time of your life

1239
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:51,240
It's the time of your life

1240
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:53,600
So live it well
