1
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,345
Look at this.
He's alive.

2
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,848
 This dog --
how you call it? Bull pit?

3
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,683
No. Pit bull.
But that's not a pit bull.

4
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:58,851
I don't know what he is.

5
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:00,811
I bet he lost somebody
some money, though.

6
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:01,979
Give me your gun.

7
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,564
- Shooting him?
- Yeah.

8
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,190
Are you sick in the head?

9
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,651
They left him out here
to suffer and die like that.

10
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,945
They -- they threw him
out the fuckin' window

11
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,113
and just kept on driving.

12
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,990
It's terrible. Come.
People wait for us.

13
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,658
Come on.
They're used to waiting.

14
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,454
Poor little guy.
Jesus, I think he broke his hip.

15
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh! Ho! Shit!

16
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:25,794
-

17
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:28,338
The fucker. He's got a lot
of bite left in him, huh?

18
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,591
I think bull pit
is not playing with you, Monty.

19
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:31,592
Yeah. No shit.

20
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,468
Come.
You want police coming?

21
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,804
Oh, look, they used him like
a fucking ashtray, man.

22
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:38,223
What a bunch of assholes.
Let's get him in the trunk.

23
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,474
What?!

24
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:42,936
There's a vet emergency room
over here. I like this guy.

25
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,647
He tries to bite
your face off.

26
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,065
He is meat.

27
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,276
You want dog --
I buy you nice puppy tomorrow.

28
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,945
No, no. What the fuck I want
with a puppy? Come on.

29
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,906
Where you go, Monty?
Monty, wait.

30
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,784
What the --
I not go near bull pit, Monty.

31
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:58,952
This thing is disgusting.

32
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,412
I told you --
it's not a pit bull.

33
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,705
Look at him.
He's a good dog.

34
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,832
I can see it in his eyes.
He's a tough little bastard.

35
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,167
He wasn't lying down
for anybody.

36
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,127
Sometimes I think
you very stupid man.

37
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,630
If we wait much longer,
he's gonna be dead, all right?

38
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,340
You want to shoot him
with my gun.

39
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,717
That was a mercy thing.
He's not ready to go yet.

40
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,885
He wants to live.

41
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:16,053
Oh, he tell you this now?

42
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,679
No, but it's like
a baby, okay?

43
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,973
They don't bitch and scream
like that, you know?

44
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:23,101
They see the doctor coming
with the needle.

45
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,896
It's good for him
in the long run.

46
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:27,481
You have no baby.

47
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,943
I can't even talk to you,
Kostya.

48
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,821
Come on.

49
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,823
Come on, you little
son of a bitch.

50
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,700
Hey. Will you quit
standing there?

51
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,244
Will you fucking
help me out here?

52
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,788
Just -- just distract him
for me or something.

53
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,415
Come on!

54
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,213
Get the --

55
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,387
I'm trying to help you,
you little prick!

56
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,684
Huh? Come on. Come on.

57
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,853

Who's more macho?

58
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,396
Monty is more macho!

59
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,064
What goes on
in your little head?

60
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,024
A little of the tricks,
a little of the quicks.

61
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,401
Boom. Bam. He's nabbed.

62
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,069
Yeah, little tricks,
little quicks.

63
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,863
You are bleeding.
You get bite.

64
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,239
Dog's blood.

65
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,324
God, you got to learn
to relax a little bit.

66
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:20,617
Live a little.

67
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:23,287
You have hole in neck
and blood is coming out.

68
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,665
 Little love bite
for saving his raggedy ass.

69
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,710
Rule number one -- you cannot
grab half-dead animals.

70
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,628
We have people
waiting for us.

71
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,754
People with money.

72
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:33,922
 Ow.

73
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,507
You want to play this cowboy!

74
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,342
No -- dogboy
in middle of highway.

75
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,886
Dogboy?
That's funny, Kostya.

76
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,679
- Yes, funny.
- You mastered the language.

77
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,432
You're bad luck, Monty.
You bring bad luck on me.

78
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,517
Always everything
that can go wrong, go wrong.

79
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,686
It is not just you and me
anymore when we go out.

80
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,937
It's you and me and Doyle.

81
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:49,938
Who's Doyle?

82
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,315
Doyle! Doyle's Law.

83
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,608
- It's Murphy.
- What?

84
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,775
Who is Murphy?

85
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,110
Who's Murphy? Who's Doyle?

86
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:56,361
It's Murphy's Law --

87
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,197
"Whatever can go wrong
will go wrong."

88
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,199
- Him! Yes.
- Yes, him.

89
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,117
What's up there, Monty?
Hey, Doyle.

90
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:14,703
-
- Easy, Doyle. Easy. Easy.

91
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,246
What do you want, Simon?

92
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,457
 I'm hungry.

93
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,876
I woke up an hour ago.
I was hungry.

94
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,128
Nothing I can do about that.
Go up to 1 10th Street.

95
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,421
1 10th Street?

96
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:26,423
Come on, man.
I can't go up there.

97
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:27,674
I mean -- whoa.

98
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,426
-

99
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:32,679
I, um -- I'm not --

100
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:34,890
I'm not looking for a mercy pop
or anything, you know.

101
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:35,933
I'm done, Simon.

102
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,643
This morning, right,
I was shaving,

103
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,854
and I cut myself --
look, look -- like four times.

104
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:43,065
Come on, Monty!
Give me a break, man!

105
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,984
I can't go up to Harlem.
Look at me.

106
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,528
The -- the "Yos" --

107
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,738
they'll eat me alive
up there, man.

108
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,615
I'm out of business, Simon.

109
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:54,368
Okay? Take your Jones
somewhere else. Leave me alone.

110
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,162
Are you afraid that I'm --
I'm gonna narc you out?

111
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,164
You know who I am.
It's me. It's Simon.

112
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:02,084
You're not listening to me.
I got touched.

113
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,502
Okay? I'm over.

114
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:04,920
Game over.

115
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,965
Five years I've been coming
to you, man -- five years!

116
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,091
Get out of here.

117
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,093
Get the fuck out of here.

118
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,262
Fine.
I'm -- I'm -- I'm leaving.

119
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:16,265
There's no need for you to be
all nasty about it, all right?

120
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,976
But I'll --
I'll remember this.

121
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:22,437
All right?
I'll remember this.

122
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,505
This is Dante.

123
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,225
Aw, what's his name?

124
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:42,226
Doyle.

125
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,727
Hi, Doyle.

126
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,008
I'm telling you,

127
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:17,135
I don't think I'm gonna even
be eligible this year.

128
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,780
Excuse me, sir?
Can I help you?

129
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,490
Hello?

130
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:42,953
Hello?

131
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:44,955
Sorry, what?

132
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,582
Did you have an appointment
with someone?

133
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,166
Oh, no.
I used to go here.

134
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,002
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave

135
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,545
and to take the dog
with you.

136
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,089
Yeah. Okay.
Okay. We'll just be a minute.

137
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,841
No dogs allowed
on the school grounds.

138
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,676
Okay. Okay. I understand.

139
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,928
Check this out.
Come here. He's all right.

140
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,556
Look at what
a little punk I was.

141
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,353
In the middle with the ball.

142
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,606
I guess you weren't
the center.

143
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,232
No. No.

144
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:13,734
I started, though.

145
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,278
Freshman year. I was
on the varsity. Point guard.

146
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,279
Yeah?

147
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:18,655
Still hold the all-time
assist record.

148
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,575
Mmh, no. Marvin Ray
broke the record last year.

149
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,659
He did not.

150
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:23,827
He did too.

151
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,078
Are you sure?

152
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:27,915
I'm positive.
I coach the girls team.

153
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:36,089
Well...we were
undefeated that year.

154
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:38,300
Then I got kicked off
the team for fighting,

155
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:39,927
and the whole thing
fell apart.

156
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,094
That's too bad.

157
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,638
Hey, you know
where Jacob Elinsky is?

158
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:45,807
He's an old friend of mine.

159
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,146
"Now let us sport us
while we may,

160
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,649
"and now, like amorous birds
of prey,

161
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,026
"rather at once
our time devour

162
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,862
"than languish
in his slow-chapt power.

163
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:01,615
"Let us roll all our strength
and all our sweetness

164
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,910
"up into one ball, and tear
our pleasures with rough strife

165
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,162
"thorough the iron gates
of life --

166
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:09,915
"thus, though we cannot make
our sun stand still,

167
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,709
yet we will make him run."

168
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,882
Good.

169
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:22,135
That's good.

170
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,512
That's an excellent reading.

171
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:26,306
What do people think?

172
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,143
What's going on here?

173
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,775
- Luke.
- Can I go to the bathroom?

174
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:38,277
No, you went 20 minutes ago.

175
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,989
Uh, I have a, um --
a bladder infection.

176
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,365
The poem.

177
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,537
"To His Coy Mistress."

178
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,372
Andrew Marvell.

179
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:52,541
Well, it's not real deep
or anything.

180
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:53,709
The guy wants to get laid,

181
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,377
and he's telling her
to give it up.

182
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,597
Excuse me...for one minute.

183
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,598
Hey...

184
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,224
- What's going on?
- Hey, who's that?

185
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:10,726
Look who's here.
It's your buddy.

186
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:13,395
Sorry to --
sorry to drop in on you.

187
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,397
I just wanted to
talk to you for a second.

188
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,523
W-What's going on?

189
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:17,566
Nothing.

190
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,067
What is this
you got going on here?

191
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:20,777
Teaching my class.
I guess.

192
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,863
- In a circle like that?
- Yeah.

193
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,364
Wow.

194
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:25,908
That's cool. I like that.

195
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:27,075
Hey, class.

196
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,077
Hey.

197
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,162
Sorry to interrupt.

198
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:31,788
Just a little, slight
change of plans.

199
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:34,082
I got to see
my father tonight,

200
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,294
and there's these people --
they're throwing me kind of a...

201
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,670
going-away party, right?

202
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:39,671
Yeah.

203
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:43,217
And, uh, so maybe you and Frank
could meet up somewhere.

204
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,762
Maybe that place with the...
things that Frank goes to.

205
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:48,096
And I'll find you later?

206
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,097
Okay.

207
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:50,224
- Yeah?
- Of course.

208
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,308
All right.

209
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:55,395
This one's cute
with the red shirt.

210
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,439
I think she's giving me
the eye.

211
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:59,733
How do you do it, man?
I don't know how you do it.

212
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,443
-
- So I'll see you later.

213
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:03,487
Yeah, maybe like midnight,
I think.

214
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,780
Midnight. Midnight's...

215
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,157
- Yeah? All right.
- Okay.

216
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:08,825
Come on, buddy.

217
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,327
Have a nice day.

218
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,669
Sorry about that.

219
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:40,816
 Oh, Christ.

220
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,007
You have a minute?

221
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,844
Sure.

222
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:11,388
Yeah, come -- come on in.

223
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,974
I thought that no students
were allowed

224
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,767
in the teachers' lounge.

225
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,853
I won't squeal on you.

226
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,150
Yeah. Take a seat?

227
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:31,617
What can I do for you?

228
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,203
I want to know why I got
a B-minus on my paper.

229
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:35,078
You got what you earned.

230
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,039
Nobody else in that class
can write, and you know it!

231
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,040
Everyone knows it.

232
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,333
Don't worry about
everyone else.

233
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,876
You're not competing
with them.

234
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,878
But I am.
I am competing with them.

235
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,881
When I apply to colleges --
you might have heard of this --

236
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:47,341
they look at these things
called "grades."

237
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:49,801
And if your grades aren't
good enough, then --

238
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:50,886
Your grade's gonna be fine.

239
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:53,889
Vincent Piscella writes a story
about his grandmother dying,

240
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,599
and you give him an A-plus.

241
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,976
Meanwhile,
the night of the funeral,

242
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,562
you know where Rhodes Scholar
Vince is?

243
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:03,941
Getting smashed at a basketball
party and slapping girls' asses.

244
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:07,778
I mean, what is that?
A charity A-plus?

245
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,571
I mean,
everyone is always writing

246
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:12,032
about their grandmothers dying,
and you know why?

247
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,867
It's not because
it's so traumatic.

248
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:16,370
It's because
it's a guaranteed A-plus!

249
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,038
And you're
all sentimental like,

250
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,415
"Oh, Vince, that was very
powerful, very moving."

251
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:21,667
No, it wasn't.

252
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,419
You didn't care.
I didn't care.

253
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:25,629
Nobody cared.

254
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,798
That's what grandmothers do.
They die!

255
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:32,469
Sometimes...guys have a hard
time showing their emotions.

256
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:34,304
So...

257
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:36,515
Slapping my ass --
that's, uh --

258
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:39,059
Vince's way of mourning
his dead grandmother?

259
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:42,229
What did your mother say
when you -- when you got that?

260
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:44,356
When I got what?

261
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:49,862
Yeah.

262
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,992
"Where did you get
the money for that?"

263
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:55,993
Oh.

264
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,328
- And?
- And what did I say or...

265
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,665
Where did I get the money?

266
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,958
Well, what did you say?

267
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,585
I said, "He likes me."

268
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:06,128
Oh.

269
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,754
Does he?

270
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,966
No.

271
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,968
Why do you care so much?

272
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,137
Just curious.

273
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,597
So, um...

274
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:21,143
You're not gonna
change the grade?

275
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,562
No. I'm not gonna change
the grade.

276
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:26,523
Great! You know what?
This was a big waste of my time!

277
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:27,691
Hold on.

278
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:40,037
 Oh, God.

279
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,338
-
- Just -- just cover my...

280
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,340
Don't freeze up on me,
you son of a...

281
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:52,674
-
- Yeah, Slaughtery.

282
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:54,968
No, I can't talk right now.
Employment number's coming out.

283
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,720
- I just wanted to let --
- Call you later.

284
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,431
I'm supposed to
meet you at Mont--

285
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,567
Hey, Frank, you coming out
with us tonight or what?

286
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:11,944
No, I got to meet
some friends tonight.

287
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,570
Big date, huh?
Who's the new bimbo?

288
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:14,738
Can I bang her first?

289
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:15,906
Yeah, you wish, brother.

290
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,491
No, it's more of
a going-away party.

291
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:18,825
Now, listen,
Frank, the other thing...

292
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,661
you still holding onto
all those O.E.X. contracts?

293
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,412
You better believe it.
Why? You nervous?

294
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:24,540
Claims numbers have dropped
three weeks straight,

295
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:26,542
and I don't feel comfortable
with this.

296
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,586
Claim numbers drop so everybody
thinks employment's gonna be up?

297
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,088
Look at me when I talk to you.

298
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:32,214
Everybody's thinking this

299
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:34,049
because it's pretty
much always true.

300
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:35,926
When it rains outside,
people get wet.

301
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:37,052
Right or wrong, Frank?

302
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:39,805
Not this time, Sal.
I got a theory. Look at this.

303
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:41,598
Oh, good!
You've got a theory.

304
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:44,351
Look, Frank --
fuck you and your theory.

305
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,103
You're in awfully deep here,
Frank.

306
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,479
You've got $60 million
of the bank's money --

307
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:49,231
$100 million.

308
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:52,192
Whoa ho!
$100-fucking-million?!

309
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:53,569
What are you two doing?

310
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:55,404
You want to be part of
the unemployment numbers?

311
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:56,738
Get back to work!

312
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:59,324
Sal, you knew they raised
my limit to $100 million.

313
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:01,326
They raised your limit a week
ago and you're maxing out?

314
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:02,619
What am I gonna do?
Sit on it?

315
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:05,163
First of all...you're not
gonna raise your voice to me.

316
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,248
That's first off.

317
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,376
You cannot put me, you,
or this firm in jeopardy

318
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,128
by putting $100 million
in one idea!

319
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,296
Right or wrong? Come on!

320
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:13,922
Right or wrong. Yeah.

321
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:15,424
Listen...

322
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:17,843
I think we're in for
a low number, all right?

323
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:19,136
Like 140, 135.

324
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,805
I really don't give a shit
what you think, Frank.

325
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:23,974
You come in here,
you're not even clean-shaven.

326
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:27,144
Stop playing with this fucking
ball and pay attention to me.

327
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:30,480
You come in here drinking your
red bullshit, stink like booze,

328
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,941
you're out all night partying --
and that's okay.

329
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:35,777
But when you become a cowboy,
that's when I draw the line.

330
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:37,029
I am still your boss,

331
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,240
and I am telling you now --
you sell half those contracts.

332
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:41,533
Do I make myself clear?

333
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:43,410
Do I make myself clear,
Frank?

334
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:44,828
Do I make myself clear to you?

335
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:45,829
Yeah.

336
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,122
Yes? Good.

337
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:48,373
Have a good day.

338
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:50,709
And by the way, we're still on
for Friday night.

339
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:52,753
Courtside, front row.
Don't be late.

340
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:55,297
It's mayhem down here
on the floor of the exchange.

341
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,175
Within moments, the unemployment
number's gonna be announced.

342
00:20:58,217 --> 00:21:00,385
Salomon Brothers,
along with most of the street,

343
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:03,347
feel the number is
going to be high --

344
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:04,389
around 250,000.

345
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:06,767
Solly's looking for
a high number.

346
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,268
280,000 is their call.

347
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,021
Fuck Salomon Brothers.

348
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:13,607
Fuck, uh --
fuck Salomon Brothers?

349
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,859
Yeah, fuck Salomon Brothers.
They're hedging their bets.

350
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:17,653
Want everybody on their side
of the fence.

351
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:20,030
Uh, what's the big deal with
the employment number anyway?

352
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,532
- Phellan.
- It's, uh, Phelan.

353
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:22,783
Whatever. Look...

354
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:24,618
More jobs means fewer people
looking for work.

355
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:26,828
Means it's harder to find good
people to fill those jobs.

356
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,497
Means you got to raise wages
to get them.

357
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,165
Means inflation goes up.
You got it?

358
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:31,500
- Yeah.
- No, I didn't think so.

359
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,835
That's why I'm doing
what I'm doing,

360
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:34,336
and you're handing out
junk mail.

361
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:35,587
Now, get off my desk.

362
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,256
you're wearing a striped shirt
with a striped tie.

363
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:38,423
You know that, right?

364
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:40,092
Yeah,
I do it for that ladies.

365
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:42,177
Do the ladies ever
tell you that you look like

366
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:43,929
a fucking optical illusion?

367
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:44,930
Yeah?

368
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,223
Go away. Disappear.
Come on.

369
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,724
I'm out of here.

370
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,145
You better hop to, sonny boy.

371
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:53,522
You know, it's funny --

372
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:56,066
I don't see you picking up the
phone to sell those contracts,

373
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,151
and I'm pretty sure I just heard
your daddy come over here

374
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:00,737
and cut off your allowance,
so I'm a little surprised.

375
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:03,282
You're not gonna disobey
a direct order, are you?

376
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,784
You know, Marcuse...
do I come into your bedroom

377
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:08,328
and tell you how to blow
your boyfriend? No.

378
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:09,371
Go away.

379
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:11,248
- Hey, Schultz!
- Yo.

380
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,083
What are we looking at
for that unemployment number?

381
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,377
250, 270 --
somewhere in there.

382
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,379
Big number. Big.

383
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,798

Hey, Frank -- we all right?

384
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:21,091
We're good.

385
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:22,801
MAN ON TV:
...investors and the market

386
00:22:22,885 --> 00:22:24,303
in uncharted waters.

387
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:26,096
So who really knows?

388
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,098
The number is coming out.

389
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:30,767
New applications --

390
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:35,606
Get me out! Now, now, now!

391
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,733
Hold the phone!
That can't...

392
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,319
We goin' for a ride now!

393
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:41,737
Whoo!

394
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:08,847
Hey, where have you been?

395
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:12,059
I got up at 7:00 this morning.
You were already gone.

396
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:14,603
Yeah. I just...

397
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:17,189
I needed to walk around
a little, you know?

398
00:23:22,778 --> 00:23:23,779
Hey.

399
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:31,036
How long you been sitting
on this stoop?

400
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,287
All day.

401
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:35,916
I've been waiting for you.

402
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:39,586
It's a beautiful day.

403
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,505
Yeah, I guess it is.

404
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:43,006
Hey, Mr. Doyle.

405
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:45,092
I missed you this morning.

406
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:46,343
Come on.

407
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:03,819
Montgomery, I want you
to talk to me.

408
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:05,070
About what, Nat?

409
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:07,072
About how you're feeling.

410
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:09,324
Well, how do you think
I'm feeling?

411
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:11,910
Well, I'm asking because
I don't like to assume.

412
00:24:11,994 --> 00:24:13,370
Well, good. Don't.

413
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,372
What do you want?

414
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:20,127
I want to be like
that girl in the X-Men --

415
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:22,171
that one that can walk
through walls.

416
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:26,592
Go on.

417
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:29,094
If I can't do that...

418
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:31,138
I don't know -- boom --
one shot to the head.

419
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:32,306
Problem solved.

420
00:24:39,188 --> 00:24:40,522
Don't joke about that.

421
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:42,858
Who says I'm joking?

422
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:09,426
So, what are we doing tonight?

423
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,428
Before you kill yourself,
that is.

424
00:25:11,512 --> 00:25:14,515
Uncle Nikolai is throwing me
a party down at Bridge.

425
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:16,725
I figure
we all head down there.

426
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:22,856
Oh, come on. I have to go.
I got no choice, okay.

427
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,900
We might as well
try to have some fun.

428
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:27,361
I thought it was over
with those guys.

429
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:29,112
Yeah, it's almost over.

430
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:32,199
I mean, it's never really over
with these guys, but...

431
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:47,548
That's a nasty habit you have,
you know that?

432
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:03,480
Come take a bath with me.

433
00:26:07,276 --> 00:26:08,986
No, not right now.

434
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:18,871
Go on. Go ahead.

435
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:35,721
I can't see me
being a -- a father.

436
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:36,930
No?

437
00:26:37,014 --> 00:26:38,849
Well, I could see
you fathering children.

438
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:42,853
You think I want to
raise my own chalupas?

439
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:44,188
I don't raise my own chalupas.

440
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:46,440
Well, we're definitely
not having any kids together

441
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:48,400
if you're gonna be
calling them "chalupas."

442
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:51,945
Oh, I -- I think
we would have very...

443
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:54,072
Very beautiful babies.

444
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:57,242
- You don't think?
- I think.

445
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:04,374
All right, show me that.

446
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:07,586
What?
No. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

447
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,463
I can't believe you did that.

448
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:11,757
I can't believe you --
Why? Why?

449
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,259
You've lived in the
United States your entire life.

450
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:16,470
You've been to Puerto Rico
twice on vacation.

451
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:18,514
You know,
I'm very proud of my heritage.

452
00:27:18,597 --> 00:27:19,932
Yeah, but what does that mean?

453
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:22,309
So I should get an lrish flag
tattooed on my ass

454
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:24,520
just 'cause my grandparents
were from there?

455
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:27,272
There's not enough room
on your skinny, white, flat ass

456
00:27:27,356 --> 00:27:28,524
for an lrish flag.

457
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:29,983
Yeah, well,
between you and me

458
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:31,985
the kids are gonna be
just about right then.

459
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:33,987
Kids? At this rate,
we're not having any.

460
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:39,868
It's probably your mother.

461
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:44,081
Coming.

462
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:49,002
Doyle, cut it out.

463
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:57,052
Kostya, you have
the worst timing ever.

464
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:59,096
Sorry to bother you,
ma'am.

465
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:00,556
Is Montgomery Brogan in?

466
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:09,731
Monty.

467
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:12,860
Monty!

468
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:18,323
Montgomery Brogan?

469
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:19,741
Yeah, that's me.

470
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:21,869
I'm Agent Flood with the Drug
Enforcement Administration.

471
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:23,412
I can see that.
What is all this?

472
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:25,747
We've got a warrant
to search your apartment.

473
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:30,669
Are you serious?

474
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:33,255
Go -- go ahead.

475
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:43,307
Hey, easy, Doyle.

476
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,808
I don't see any tags
on that dog.

477
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,268
He's inside.
He doesn't need tags.

478
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:48,604
He better stay calm or I'll have
the pound come get him.

479
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:51,815
Seen too many men bit
by these mean bastards.

480
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,067
Doyle.

481
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:55,736
 Come on.

482
00:28:57,738 --> 00:28:58,739
Sit.

483
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:08,207
 Oh...

484
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:10,167
You, uh, mind if I have
a seat?

485
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:12,753
No. Be my guest.

486
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:16,256
Uh, Miss Riviera? Heh.
That's your name, right?

487
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,884
I need you to stay
right here, ma'am.

488
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:21,136
Can't have you
sneaking around.

489
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:26,808
You know, this sofa's not
very comfortable.

490
00:29:26,892 --> 00:29:28,852
Ah, maybe it's your posture.

491
00:29:28,894 --> 00:29:31,021
Your posture
is very important.

492
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:34,858
No, it's this, uh,
Castro convertible.

493
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:40,197
It's very uncomfortable.
It's kind of -- kind of lumpy.

494
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,741
You know,
I just don't understand it.

495
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:45,911
It looks like
such a nice sofa.

496
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:49,081
How much did you pay for
this sofa, Miss Riviera?

497
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:54,211
Maybe it's the padding.

498
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:55,587
Booyah!

499
00:29:55,671 --> 00:29:57,756
Could be the padding.

500
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,883
Yeah.

501
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:02,636
Probably the padding.

502
00:30:09,935 --> 00:30:11,728
Go on. Get it over with.

503
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:20,904
Hmm.

504
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:24,491
There's something lumpy
in here, Mr. Brogan.

505
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:31,123
You know, it's a good thing
I found this.

506
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:35,627
It's gonna make your sofa so
much more comfortable to sit on.

507
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,302
Sh-e-e-e-it.

508
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:46,722
Mr. Brogan,
I do believe you're fucked.

509
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:48,473
Royally.

510
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:53,604
Sh-e-e-e-it.

511
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,075
Baby...

512
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:08,744
Baby?

513
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:11,830
Are you okay?

514
00:31:11,914 --> 00:31:12,915
Yeah.

515
00:31:12,998 --> 00:31:16,418
This will be the best night
of my life.

516
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:18,378
Best night of my life.

517
00:31:18,462 --> 00:31:21,048
I just -- you know, I've been
waiting around all day long --

518
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:23,634
I just want to know if we're
gonna spend any time together.

519
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:24,635
I know. I know.

520
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:26,512
Could you just talk to me?

521
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:28,514
Talk to me, okay?

522
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:30,766
We haven't been talking.
This is our last night --

523
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,477
No. No, no, no.
It's not our last night.

524
00:31:34,645 --> 00:31:36,146
It's my last night.

525
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:39,483
Not your last night.
You got all kinds of nights.

526
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:42,653
You got nights
with your girlfriends...

527
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:44,655
going out clubbing,
sitting at bars...

528
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:47,241
"You and me" equals "our."
This is our last night.

529
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:49,868
You can sit at home watching
movies with your mother.

530
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,203
You got all kinds of nights.

531
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:53,497
Look, I don't understand what
you're not understanding here.

532
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:55,999
Hey, you know what?
I can't do this right now, okay?

533
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:58,502
Babe, I need you
to just be quiet.

534
00:31:58,544 --> 00:32:00,003
Please just be quiet.

535
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:01,964
But we haven't talked
about this at all.

536
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:04,007
Lately you can't even
look at me in the eye.

537
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:05,968
I have to go. Meet us
at the place in Chinatown.

538
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:07,135
Where are you going?

539
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:09,972
I've got to see my father
tonight, you know?

540
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:17,980
Do -- do me a favor, and wear
that silver dress tonight, okay?

541
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:22,484
You want me to?

542
00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:24,903
Yeah...yeah.

543
00:32:26,488 --> 00:32:28,323
That's how I want to
remember you.

544
00:32:43,422 --> 00:32:46,049
Mmm, very nice. Very nice.

545
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:48,635
Hello, beautiful lady.

546
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:50,554
Beautiful baby.

547
00:32:50,637 --> 00:32:53,265
You look like Halle Berry.
They tell you this?

548
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:54,558
Come back.

549
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:57,060
I make you half-black,
half-Russian baby.

550
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:03,108
So many beautiful woman.
I love this neighborhood.

551
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,318
How much is rent?

552
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:05,652
You can't afford it.
Trust me.

553
00:33:05,736 --> 00:33:07,362
What are you doing here?

554
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:08,739
Something is wrong?

555
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:10,407
No, I'm having the time
of my life.

556
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,534
What do you think,
you dumb shit?

557
00:33:12,618 --> 00:33:14,703
Uncle Nikolai wants me
talking with you.

558
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:16,997
Wants to make sure
you come to club tonight.

559
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,750
You're like the third person in
two days that's said that to me.

560
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:22,252
What the fuck is going on?
What does he really want?

561
00:33:22,294 --> 00:33:24,046
I don't know.

562
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:26,798
You come all the way up here
just to tell me you don't know?

563
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:28,884
You do not answer my calls,
and Uncle wants to make sure

564
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:30,928
that you're tonight
at the Bridge.

565
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:33,347
I'll be there!
For Christ's sake. Tell him.

566
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,349
Tell him I'm --
I'm bringing some friends.

567
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:36,767
I'm bringing Naturelle.

568
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:39,728
Monty.
Wait, Monty. Please.

569
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:41,688
- Why you bring her?
- Why wouldn't l?

570
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:44,024
We have this discussion
once before, no?

571
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:45,400
You get very mad at me.

572
00:33:45,484 --> 00:33:48,278
Oh, you know what?
Will you stop with that already?

573
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:51,448
I already told you --
it wasn't her.

574
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:52,950
How you know this?

575
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:54,451
Why would she?

576
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:57,454
Maybe her aunt is illegal alien.
You know, these Mexicans...

577
00:33:57,538 --> 00:33:58,997
Hey, hey, she's Puerto Rican.

578
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:00,666
That makes her a citizen
of the United States.

579
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:02,084
That's more
than I can say for you.

580
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,544
Maybe the feds,
they -- they bust --

581
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:05,546
The feds. You know,
you're fucking cracking up.

582
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:07,506
Filling my head with this shit.
You're crazy.

583
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:08,715
You ask her?

584
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,220
No, I didn't ask her.

585
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,932
Listen.

586
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:21,478
Before you leave...
you should know.

587
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:23,772
I'll see you down there.

588
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:54,845
Those guys coming back
in here yet?

589
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:55,971
Not much.

590
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:57,681
Well, you know --
little by little.

591
00:34:57,764 --> 00:34:59,349
It was hard on those guys.

592
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:01,977
I went to elementary school
with that guy Nick.

593
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:03,520
You remember -- Nicky?

594
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:08,025
Oh, Nick. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Good kid.

595
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:09,943
Place looks good, though.

596
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:10,944
Hmm.

597
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:12,946
Want to take your coat off?

598
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,908
Um, no.
I was feeling a little cold.

599
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:18,035
Hmm.

600
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:19,953
Oh.

601
00:35:21,205 --> 00:35:22,873
That's a hell of a steak.

602
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:24,833
Only the best for you, sweetie.

603
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:27,044
I'll send you cookies
every month.

604
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:29,630
- Peanut butter, right?
- That's it.

605
00:35:32,257 --> 00:35:35,844
I, uh...I talked to Sal.

606
00:35:35,928 --> 00:35:38,055
- Oh, Dad, come on.
- I'll see if he can help.

607
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:40,432
Dad, the guy's been out
of the picture for 20 years.

608
00:35:40,516 --> 00:35:41,558
He still knows people.

609
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:42,851
Look, that's not the point.

610
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:46,230
I-I don't want you
to get involved, okay?

611
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:50,067
I mean it.
I'm -- I'm gonna be all right.

612
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,694
You know, you'll still be
a young man when you get out.

613
00:35:52,778 --> 00:35:54,112
I know you don't think
about it,

614
00:35:54,196 --> 00:35:55,697
but don't start
any trouble in there.

615
00:35:55,781 --> 00:35:58,200
- Keep your head down.
- Don't worry about me, please.

616
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:02,037
This should never
have happened.

617
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,872
You could've been --
you wanted money,

618
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:06,834
you could've done anything
you wanted -- doctor, lawyer.

619
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:08,168
That's all I'm saying.

620
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,336
Don't lay that on me.

621
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:12,381
When Sal and his crew were
squeezing you for the payments,

622
00:36:12,464 --> 00:36:15,384
I didn't hear you wishing I was
a law school student then.

623
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:17,469
Not one word from you
back then.

624
00:36:18,804 --> 00:36:21,557
Where'd you think that money was
coming from -- Donald Trump?

625
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,767
- That was a mistake.
- Let's just forget it, then.

626
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:26,311
There were lots of mistakes.

627
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:28,939
I should've stopped drinking
when your mother passed.

628
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:30,732
Please don't do this.

629
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:33,443
1 1-year-old boy with a
dead mother and a drunk father.

630
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:35,445
I got no one to blame
but myself.

631
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:37,573
Oh, stop. Stop.

632
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:39,283
It wasn't you, Pop.

633
00:36:45,956 --> 00:36:47,249
I'm gonna take a leak.

634
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:05,934
Yeah, fuck you, too.

635
00:37:06,018 --> 00:37:08,103
Fuck me? Fuck you.

636
00:37:08,187 --> 00:37:10,814
Fuck you and this whole city
and everyone in it.

637
00:37:10,898 --> 00:37:12,733
No, no, no, no, no.

638
00:37:12,816 --> 00:37:15,277
Fuck the panhandlers
grubbing for money,

639
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,279
smiling at me behind my back.

640
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:18,739
Fuck the squeegee men

641
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:20,908
dirtying up the clean
windshield of my car.

642
00:37:20,991 --> 00:37:22,784
Get a fucking job.

643
00:37:22,868 --> 00:37:24,953
Fuck the Sikhs
and the Pakistanis

644
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:27,956
bombing down the avenues
in decrepit cabs,

645
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:31,335
curry steaming out their pores,
stinking up my day.

646
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:34,796
Terrorists in fucking training.
Slow the fuck down!

647
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,340
...getting one
of those operations

648
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:38,133
that elongate your penis.

649
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:39,801
Fuck the Chelsea Boys

650
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:42,721
with their waxed chests
and pumped-up biceps,

651
00:37:42,804 --> 00:37:45,807
going down on each other
in my parks and on my piers,

652
00:37:45,891 --> 00:37:48,644
jiggling their dicks
on my Channel 35!

653
00:37:48,727 --> 00:37:50,812
Fuck the Korean grocers

654
00:37:50,896 --> 00:37:53,023
with their pyramids
of overpriced fruit

655
00:37:53,106 --> 00:37:55,567
and their tulips and roses
wrapped in plastic.

656
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:58,195
Ten years in the country,
still no speakee English.

657
00:37:58,278 --> 00:38:00,322
Fuck the Russians
in Brighton Beach.

658
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:04,576
Mobster thugs sitting in cafes,
sipping tea in little glasses,

659
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:06,119
sugar cubes
between their teeth,

660
00:38:06,203 --> 00:38:08,539
wheelin' and dealin'
and schemin'.

661
00:38:08,622 --> 00:38:10,749
Go back
where you fucking came from.

662
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:12,918
Fuck the black-hatted Hasidim

663
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:15,420
strolling up and down
47th Street

664
00:38:15,462 --> 00:38:18,048
in their dirty gabardine
with their dandruff,

665
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:20,717
selling South African
apartheid diamonds.

666
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:22,719
Come on.
Your wife deserves this.

667
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:24,847
Fuck the Wall Street brokers.

668
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:27,266
Self-styled masters
of the universe.

669
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:30,853
Michael Douglas-Gordon Gekko
wannabe motherfuckers

670
00:38:30,894 --> 00:38:34,648
figuring out new ways
to rob hardworking people blind.

671
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:38,694
Send those Enron assholes
to jail for fucking life.

672
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:41,655
You think Bush and Cheney
didn't know about that shit?

673
00:38:41,738 --> 00:38:43,574
Give me a fucking break.

674
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:47,244
Worldcom.

675
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:48,287
Fuck the Puerto Ricans.

676
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:51,373
Twenty to a car,
swelling up the welfare rolls.

677
00:38:51,415 --> 00:38:53,208
Worst fucking parade
in the city.

678
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:56,086
And don't even get me started
on the Dominicans,

679
00:38:56,128 --> 00:38:58,714
'cause they make
the Puerto Ricans look good.

680
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:01,049
Who's this fuckin' guy?!
Get the fuck outta here!

681
00:39:01,175 --> 00:39:04,136
Fuck the Bensonhurst ltalians
with their pomaded hair,

682
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:07,347
their nylon warm-up suits,
their St. Anthony medallions,

683
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:11,643
swinging their Jason Giambi
Louisville Slugger baseball bats

684
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:13,645
trying to audition
for "The Sopranos."

685
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:15,689
Fuckin' crack

00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,489
Taxi!

690
00:39:24,573 --> 00:39:26,867
Overfed faces
getting pulled and lifted

691
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,411
and stretched all taut
and shiny.

692
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:32,372
You're not fooling anybody,
sweetheart.

693
00:39:32,456 --> 00:39:33,540
Taxi!

694
00:39:33,624 --> 00:39:35,375
Fuck the Uptown brothers.

695
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:36,710
They never pass the ball,

696
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:38,795
they don't want to
play defense,

697
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:40,881
they take five steps
on every layup to the hoop,

698
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:42,424
and then they want to
turn around

699
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:44,927
and blame everything
on the white man.

700
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:47,304
We not giving it up!
We not giving it up!

701
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:50,390
Slavery ended 137 years ago.

702
00:39:50,474 --> 00:39:53,519
Move the fuck on.

703
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:57,147
Fuck the corrupt cops with
their anus-violating plungers

704
00:39:57,231 --> 00:39:58,565
and their 41 shots,

705
00:39:58,607 --> 00:40:00,609
standing behind a blue wall
of silence.

706
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:03,153
You betray our trust!

707
00:40:03,237 --> 00:40:05,155
Fuck the priests
who put their hands

708
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:07,324
down some
innocent child's pants.

709
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:10,702
Fuck the church that protects
them, delivering us into evil.

710
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:12,871
And while you're at it,
fuck J.C.

711
00:40:12,955 --> 00:40:14,248
He got off easy --

712
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:16,917
a day on the cross,
a weekend in hell,

713
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,170
and all the hallelujahs of the
legioned angels for eternity.

714
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:23,173
Try seven years
in fucking Otisville, J.

715
00:40:23,215 --> 00:40:25,259
Fuck Osama bin Laden,
Al Qaeda,

716
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:27,594
and backward-ass cave-dwelling

717
00:40:27,678 --> 00:40:29,847
fundamentalist assholes
everywhere.

718
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:32,975
On the names of
innocent thousands murdered,

719
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:36,770
I pray you spend the rest
of eternity with your 72 whores

720
00:40:36,854 --> 00:40:39,273
roasting in a jet-fuel fire
in hell.

721
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:44,528
You towel-headed camel jockeys
can kiss my royal lrish ass.

722
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:46,905
"l notice how many
of what I once thought

723
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:49,449
"were evidences of repression,
sexual or otherwise..."

724
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:51,827
Fuck Jacob Elinsky.

725
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,161
Whining malcontent.

726
00:40:53,245 --> 00:40:55,539
Fuck Francis Xavier Slaughtery,
my best friend,

727
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:59,084
judging me while he stares
at my girlfriend's ass.

728
00:40:59,168 --> 00:41:01,753
Fuck Naturelle Riviera.

729
00:41:01,837 --> 00:41:05,048
I gave her my trust,
and she stabbed me in the back.

730
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:08,552
Sold me up the river.
Fucking bitch.

731
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:11,221
Fuck my father
with his endless grief,

732
00:41:11,263 --> 00:41:14,683
standing behind that bar,
sipping on club soda,

733
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:17,936
selling whiskey to firemen
and cheering the Bronx Bombers.

734
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:21,273
Let's go, Yankees!

735
00:41:22,357 --> 00:41:24,443
Fuck this whole city
and everyone in it,

736
00:41:24,526 --> 00:41:26,236
from the row houses of Astoria

737
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,238
to the penthouses
on Park Avenue,

738
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:31,408
from the projects in the Bronx
to the lofts in Soho,

739
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:33,535
from the tenements
in Alphabet City

740
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:35,287
to the brownstones
in Park Slope

741
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:37,372
to the split-levels
in Staten lsland,

742
00:41:37,414 --> 00:41:40,792
Iet an earthquake crumble it,
let the fires rage,

743
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:44,546
Iet it burn to fucking ash,
and then let the waters rise

744
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,841
and submerge this whole
rat-infested place.

745
00:41:52,888 --> 00:41:55,098
No.

746
00:41:55,182 --> 00:41:58,560
No. Fuck you,
Montgomery Brogan.

747
00:41:58,602 --> 00:41:59,853
You had it all,

748
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:03,315
and you threw it away,
you dumb fuck!

749
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:14,076
What do you think
of Naturelle?

750
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:16,828
She's a good girl.
Your mother would've liked her.

751
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,622
- Yeah, but you trust her?
- Do I trust her?

752
00:42:18,664 --> 00:42:20,290
- Mm-hmm.
- Why do I have to trust her?

753
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:22,292
- You think I can trust her?
- Where you going with this?

754
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:23,293
Oh, I don't know.

755
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:25,921
People are...
saying weird things.

756
00:42:26,004 --> 00:42:27,756
I'm hearing stuff around,

757
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,467
Iike maybe she was the one
that made the phone call on me.

758
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:31,718
Why would she do a thing
like that?

759
00:42:31,802 --> 00:42:33,554
Maybe they got to her,
you know?

760
00:42:33,637 --> 00:42:36,598
It happens. They find something,
put the screws on you.

761
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,059
The girl loves you. I can't
believe she would betray you.

762
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:41,019
I don't know.
I don't know.

763
00:42:41,103 --> 00:42:44,147
I mean, everything's gotten
so strange, Pop.

764
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:45,774
I look at these people
around me,

765
00:42:45,816 --> 00:42:48,610
and I'm thinking,
"These are my friends?

766
00:42:48,652 --> 00:42:51,280
I don't even know
these people."

767
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:53,407
You know, and --
and Naturelle, even.

768
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,284
Do I --
do I really know her?

769
00:42:55,367 --> 00:42:56,451
I don't know.

770
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:58,412
It's all...

771
00:42:58,495 --> 00:43:02,124
The only people I trust
are you, Jacob, and Frank --

772
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:03,500
the guys I grew up with.

773
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:04,835
I miss those boys.

774
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:06,962
Yeah, I know.

775
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:08,714
I'm supposed to be
meeting them.

776
00:43:08,797 --> 00:43:10,424
They're waiting for me.

777
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:11,842
I-I ought to get going.

778
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:12,968
What about your food?

779
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:14,011
I can't.

780
00:43:14,052 --> 00:43:15,679
Okay.

781
00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:17,848
I'll, uh, see you
in the morning.

782
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:20,559
No. No. Why?
I'm gonna take the bus up there.

783
00:43:20,642 --> 00:43:21,852
Oh, forget about the bus.

784
00:43:21,935 --> 00:43:24,646
I'll drive you.
Take half as long.

785
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:29,067
Take...this.

786
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:31,236
They'll let you keep it.

787
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,654
When you was a little kid,

788
00:43:32,696 --> 00:43:34,489
you used to sleep
in that fireman's helmet.

789
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:36,617
You wanted to be
just like your daddy.

790
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,328
I ever tell you about the fights
we had naming you?

791
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:41,163
Yeah. You wanted to
name me James.

792
00:43:41,205 --> 00:43:43,165
James Brogan Jr. --
good, strong name.

793
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:45,626
Nah. Your mother thought
it was too boring for you.

794
00:43:45,709 --> 00:43:47,336
- She liked Montgomery Clift.
- Loved him.

795
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:49,338
"Place in the Sun" --
her favorite movie.

796
00:43:49,421 --> 00:43:51,173
I kept saying,
"Montgomery Clift --

797
00:43:51,215 --> 00:43:53,008
"look what happened
to that poor fuck.

798
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,760
Died way too young.
Bad luck."

799
00:43:56,845 --> 00:43:58,847
Bad luck.

800
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:02,184
I'm gonna go, okay?

801
00:44:03,185 --> 00:44:04,520
I'll see you soon, Pop.

802
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:12,277
Monty...

803
00:44:26,917 --> 00:44:29,503
He'll be working
for me. I'll have his job.

804
00:44:30,587 --> 00:44:32,881
Listen, I got to go.
Talk to you tomorrow.

805
00:44:32,923 --> 00:44:34,424
Cocksucker.

806
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:38,345
- How you doing, bro?
- Hey.

807
00:44:38,428 --> 00:44:39,721
-

808
00:44:39,763 --> 00:44:42,015
- Good to see you.
- How you doing?

809
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:43,767
Good. Come on in.

810
00:44:43,809 --> 00:44:44,977
All right.

811
00:44:46,478 --> 00:44:47,563
Want a beer?

812
00:44:47,646 --> 00:44:49,106
- Yeah.
- Cool.

813
00:45:02,035 --> 00:45:03,287
- There you go.
- Thanks.

814
00:45:03,328 --> 00:45:04,663
Cheers.

815
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:19,136
Jesus Christ.

816
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:20,888
Yeah.

817
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:32,774
Yeah, The New York Times says
the air's bad down here.

818
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:33,984
Oh, yeah?

819
00:45:34,067 --> 00:45:37,070
Well, fuck The Times.
I read the Post.

820
00:45:39,114 --> 00:45:41,283
E.P.A. says it's fine.

821
00:45:42,701 --> 00:45:44,995
Somebody's lying.

822
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:50,125
Yeah.

823
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:51,919
You gonna move?

824
00:45:52,002 --> 00:45:53,253
Fuck that, man.

825
00:45:53,337 --> 00:45:55,964
As much good money as I pay
for this place?

826
00:45:56,006 --> 00:45:57,549
Hell, no.

827
00:45:57,591 --> 00:45:58,800
Tell you what.

828
00:45:58,884 --> 00:46:02,179
Bin Laden can drop another one
right next door. I ain't moving.

829
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:17,361
What do we say to him?

830
00:46:19,321 --> 00:46:20,531
Don't say nothing.

831
00:46:20,614 --> 00:46:22,574
He's going to hell
for seven years.

832
00:46:22,658 --> 00:46:24,660
What am I gonna do,
wish him luck?

833
00:46:25,827 --> 00:46:27,913
Just get him drunk.

834
00:46:27,996 --> 00:46:30,499
Make sure he has
one last good night.

835
00:46:33,126 --> 00:46:34,545
That's it.

836
00:46:34,628 --> 00:46:36,713
So you're up for this?

837
00:46:36,797 --> 00:46:38,090
Yeah.

838
00:46:39,925 --> 00:46:42,177
I don't even know
why he invited me.

839
00:46:42,261 --> 00:46:43,971
What are you
talking about, man?

840
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:47,808
You know, we hardly ever
see each other anymore.

841
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:50,727
You know, you and I are
his friends from the past.

842
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:52,020
Oh, yeah.

843
00:46:52,104 --> 00:46:54,898
Like his friends from the
present have done him much good.

844
00:46:56,316 --> 00:46:59,403
 I just...

845
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:02,072
I just can't believe
he's going away for seven years.

846
00:47:02,155 --> 00:47:03,699
Someone turns him in and...

847
00:47:03,782 --> 00:47:06,326
Oh, don't feed me that shit.

848
00:47:06,368 --> 00:47:07,536
What shit?

849
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:10,873
Come on, Jake.
Don't feed me that bullshit.

850
00:47:10,956 --> 00:47:12,207
Yeah, he got caught.

851
00:47:12,249 --> 00:47:15,210
But hello --
Monty's a fucking drug dealer.

852
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:16,879
Shit.

853
00:47:16,962 --> 00:47:20,883
What, are you -- you driving
a vintage Super "B"?

854
00:47:20,966 --> 00:47:22,926
- No.
- No. He is.

855
00:47:22,968 --> 00:47:26,305
Yeah, paid for by the misery
of other people.

856
00:47:27,764 --> 00:47:29,683
He got caught.
He's gonna get locked up.

857
00:47:29,766 --> 00:47:31,351
And I'll tell you
something else.

858
00:47:31,435 --> 00:47:33,687
You two are my best friends
in the whole world,

859
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:36,607
and I love him like a brother,
but he fucking deserves it.

860
00:47:39,568 --> 00:47:41,111
He deserves it.

861
00:47:42,404 --> 00:47:45,032
What's he planning on doing
with Doyle?

862
00:47:45,115 --> 00:47:47,367
How the fuck should I know?

863
00:47:50,454 --> 00:47:51,622
I don't know.

864
00:47:51,663 --> 00:47:55,709
Maybe...Ieave him
with Naturelle or something.

865
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:58,795
They should at least let him
take Doyle with him.

866
00:48:00,339 --> 00:48:01,423
What?

867
00:48:01,507 --> 00:48:03,258
Just let him take Doyle
with him.

868
00:48:03,342 --> 00:48:04,426
He wouldn't be so lonely.

869
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:08,263
You can't take a fucking dog
to the hoosegow, Jake.

870
00:48:08,347 --> 00:48:11,517
I'm just saying it'd be
kind of nice if he could.

871
00:48:13,727 --> 00:48:15,812
All right.

872
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:17,397
Yeah, it'd be nice.

873
00:48:24,947 --> 00:48:27,783
Monty's tough.
I think he'll be okay.

874
00:48:29,368 --> 00:48:32,079
If it were me,
l...I'd never last a day,

875
00:48:32,162 --> 00:48:34,790
but...Monty, he's different.

876
00:48:34,873 --> 00:48:36,208
Oh, yeah?
You believe that?

877
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,334
Yeah.

878
00:48:37,417 --> 00:48:39,503
You don't fucking get it,
do you?

879
00:48:39,586 --> 00:48:40,712
What don't I get?

880
00:48:40,796 --> 00:48:42,714
You want the simple
version, Jake?

881
00:48:42,798 --> 00:48:46,093
Guys who look like Monty don't
do well in prison, all right?

882
00:48:46,176 --> 00:48:49,638
Man, he's got three choices,
and none of them are good.

883
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,058
One, he can run.
Two, catch the bullet train.

884
00:48:53,141 --> 00:48:54,059
Bullet train?

885
00:48:54,142 --> 00:48:55,727
I'm not saying
what he's gonna do.

886
00:48:55,769 --> 00:48:57,271
I'm saying
what his choices are.

887
00:48:57,312 --> 00:48:59,314
His third choice is he goes
to prison, that's it.

888
00:48:59,439 --> 00:49:00,858
Yeah, and that's
what he's gonna do.

889
00:49:00,899 --> 00:49:02,860
He'll go and I'll see him
when he gets out.

890
00:49:05,195 --> 00:49:06,947
Maybe.

891
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:09,616
I'll tell you what.

892
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:13,537
After tonight,
it's bye-bye, Monty.

893
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:17,291
What does that mean?

894
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:22,462
Man, if he runs, he's gone.
He ain't coming home.

895
00:49:22,546 --> 00:49:24,840
If he pulls the trigger,
they close the casket.

896
00:49:24,882 --> 00:49:26,133
He's gone.

897
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:29,970
They lock him away, he's gone.
You'll never see him again.

898
00:49:30,053 --> 00:49:31,471
I'll see him again.

899
00:49:31,555 --> 00:49:32,639
No, you won't.

900
00:49:32,723 --> 00:49:35,726
I'll visit him up there and
I'll see him when he gets out.

901
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:38,228
This is such horseshit.
This is so much like you, Jake.

902
00:49:38,312 --> 00:49:40,063
- You're not gonna see him --
- Like me?

903
00:49:40,147 --> 00:49:41,565
Yeah, it's...exactly.

904
00:49:41,607 --> 00:49:43,692
- What's -- why --
- You'll never see him again.

905
00:49:43,775 --> 00:49:46,403
You think you're gonna
kick back with some beers,

906
00:49:46,486 --> 00:49:49,531
reminisce -- old times --
you're still gonna be friends?

907
00:49:49,615 --> 00:49:52,784
It's over after tonight, Jake.
Wake the fuck up.

908
00:50:54,596 --> 00:50:56,098
Let her go.

909
00:51:03,897 --> 00:51:05,983
That's a good-looking girl
you got there.

910
00:51:08,986 --> 00:51:12,072
Ooh.
That's a scary look.

911
00:51:12,155 --> 00:51:14,283
Yikes.

912
00:51:14,366 --> 00:51:16,326
You see the look he gave me?

913
00:51:19,705 --> 00:51:23,166
Naturelle Riviera --
what a name.

914
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:28,797
You know what?
Take another angle, man.

915
00:51:28,881 --> 00:51:30,257
You can't fucking touch her.

916
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:32,968
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

917
00:51:32,968 --> 00:51:34,928
You're missing the point.

918
00:51:35,012 --> 00:51:36,471
She touched you.

919
00:51:36,555 --> 00:51:38,015
- You're lying.
- Am l?

920
00:51:38,056 --> 00:51:40,517
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's sweet.

921
00:51:42,728 --> 00:51:44,813
All I know is
she's walking away.

922
00:51:44,897 --> 00:51:47,024
Yeah.
We just signed her release.

923
00:51:47,107 --> 00:51:48,859
Probably having
a big party tonight

924
00:51:48,901 --> 00:51:51,195
over at Jimmy's Bronx Cafe.

925
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:52,529
Sure. Why not?

926
00:51:52,613 --> 00:51:54,114
Big celebration.

927
00:51:54,198 --> 00:51:58,076
She got that whole fancy
apartment to herself now.

928
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,871
What? You thought she was
with you for your looks?

929
00:52:00,996 --> 00:52:03,749
Sh-e-e-e-it.

930
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:06,168
Girl saw a pot of honey,
and she licked it clean.

931
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,169
Yeah.

932
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:10,005
She's a real smart girl.

933
00:52:10,047 --> 00:52:12,132
Now,
you, on the other hand...

934
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:13,967
You're supposed to be smart.

935
00:52:14,051 --> 00:52:18,430
Got yourself a scholarship
to a fancy private school, hmm?

936
00:52:18,472 --> 00:52:20,057
Not bad for a punk
from Bay Ridge.

937
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,434
Yeah, but then you go
and get yourself thrown out

938
00:52:22,518 --> 00:52:24,937
for dealing weed
to some rich kids.

939
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,146
What up with that?

940
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:28,899
You know what happens to
pretty boys like you in prison?

941
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:29,900
Ooh.

942
00:52:29,942 --> 00:52:31,652
They gonna love you.

943
00:52:34,196 --> 00:52:36,156
Yeah, maybe.

944
00:52:37,449 --> 00:52:40,827
But then again...maybe not.

945
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:43,372
"Jeez, Your Honor, you know,
what can I say?

946
00:52:43,455 --> 00:52:45,249
"l messed up.

947
00:52:45,332 --> 00:52:46,959
"You know, my mother died.

948
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:48,585
"l-I was so worried
about my father.

949
00:52:48,669 --> 00:52:50,087
"l needed to help him out.

950
00:52:50,128 --> 00:52:51,839
"My head was a little
turned around.

951
00:52:51,922 --> 00:52:53,507
"l got hooked in
with the wrong people,

952
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:55,050
"and I made a big mistake.

953
00:52:55,133 --> 00:52:59,429
"l really did,
but...it was my first time.

954
00:52:59,513 --> 00:53:02,516
I'm sorry, and it will never,
ever happen again."

955
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:08,063
Time served. Probation.

956
00:53:08,146 --> 00:53:11,191
You don't read the papers much,
do you, smart guy?

957
00:53:11,275 --> 00:53:12,568
In New York,

958
00:53:12,568 --> 00:53:15,571
we've got a wonderful thing
called the Rockefeller Laws.

959
00:53:15,612 --> 00:53:17,155
Let me educate you.

960
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:19,283
You had a kilo in your sofa.

961
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:22,411
That kind of weight
makes it an A-1 felony.

962
00:53:22,494 --> 00:53:25,789
15 years to life minimum
for first offense.

963
00:53:25,873 --> 00:53:27,833
Now, with that much spread
in the sentencing guidelines,

964
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:30,210
the judges take their cues
from the prosecutors.

965
00:53:30,294 --> 00:53:33,005
So if Mr. Prosecutor's wife
busted his chops that morning,

966
00:53:33,088 --> 00:53:34,131
you're fucked.

967
00:53:34,214 --> 00:53:35,674
You're gone for good.

968
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:37,759
If you get lucky --
really lucky --

969
00:53:37,843 --> 00:53:40,971
now, let's say he got
some good trim the night before.

970
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:43,515
Maybe he'll plead you off
to an A-2.

971
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,685
But that's still three to eight
for first time -- minimum.

972
00:53:46,727 --> 00:53:48,353
How much of that stretch
you pull

973
00:53:48,437 --> 00:53:50,647
is all up to the mood
of the prosecutor,

974
00:53:50,689 --> 00:53:54,401
and he's gonna ask us,
"Did he play ball?"

975
00:53:55,694 --> 00:53:58,155
So...

976
00:53:58,238 --> 00:54:01,825
why don't you tell us
about your friend Nikolai?

977
00:54:01,909 --> 00:54:03,911
Let us make it easy on you.

978
00:54:05,537 --> 00:54:07,664
Can I ask you one question?

979
00:54:07,748 --> 00:54:09,416
 Sure.

980
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:17,049
When you have your dick
in his mouth,

981
00:54:17,132 --> 00:54:19,801
does he just keep talking
like that?

982
00:54:20,928 --> 00:54:23,263
'Cause it seems to me
he just never shuts up,

983
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:25,015
and I'm --
I'm just curious --

984
00:54:25,098 --> 00:54:26,683
does that --
does that get annoying?

985
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:28,644
You know, you're fucking a guy
in the mouth,

986
00:54:28,685 --> 00:54:31,438
-

987
00:54:33,065 --> 00:54:35,526
Look here,
you vanilla motherfucker.

988
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:39,613
When you're upstate
taking it in the culo

989
00:54:39,696 --> 00:54:42,324
by a bunch of guys
calling you Shirley,

990
00:54:42,366 --> 00:54:45,327
you'll only have yourself
and Governor Rockefeller

991
00:54:45,327 --> 00:54:47,162
to thank for the privilege.

992
00:54:47,204 --> 00:54:49,623
Let's get the hell out of here.

993
00:54:49,706 --> 00:54:53,335
Tell the U.S. attorney
we got a hard-ass.

994
00:55:03,595 --> 00:55:06,139
You need a girlfriend.

995
00:55:06,223 --> 00:55:08,058
- I need a girlfriend?
- Yeah.

996
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,726
 Wait a minute.

997
00:55:09,768 --> 00:55:11,770
When was the last time
you had a girlfriend?

998
00:55:11,854 --> 00:55:13,981
All right? When was
the last time you got laid?

999
00:55:14,064 --> 00:55:15,148
I've got prospects.

1000
00:55:15,232 --> 00:55:17,150
- Yeah, you got prospects.
- I do.

1001
00:55:17,234 --> 00:55:18,402
You know what?

1002
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:21,864
You're in the 62nd percentile
is what you are.

1003
00:55:21,947 --> 00:55:23,866
- What is that?
- 62nd percentile?

1004
00:55:23,949 --> 00:55:26,410
- Yeah.
- That's where you rate.

1005
00:55:26,493 --> 00:55:28,453
All the bachelors in New York,
we're all competing

1006
00:55:28,537 --> 00:55:30,581
for the same women --
well, the straight bachelors.

1007
00:55:30,622 --> 00:55:32,040
And I'm in
the 62nd percentile?

1008
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:33,542
- Yes, sir.
- So in other words,

1009
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:35,961
I'm better than 62%
of the New York bachelors.

1010
00:55:36,044 --> 00:55:37,212
You're rated higher
than them, yeah.

1011
00:55:37,296 --> 00:55:40,048
But worse than what, 38%?

1012
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:41,383
37. No 100 percentile.

1013
00:55:41,466 --> 00:55:43,552
How'd you come up with 62?

1014
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:45,637
There's a whole science
to figuring it out.

1015
00:55:45,721 --> 00:55:47,264
There's a science
to figuring it out?

1016
00:55:47,347 --> 00:55:48,974
That sounds very scientific.

1017
00:55:49,057 --> 00:55:51,018
And if I may inquire,
what's your rating?

1018
00:55:51,101 --> 00:55:52,561
- Funny you should ask.
- Hmm.

1019
00:55:52,603 --> 00:55:55,022
Because I happen to fall
right in the 99 percentile.

1020
00:55:55,105 --> 00:55:57,149
 Of course.

1021
00:55:57,232 --> 00:55:59,401
Who came up with the ratings?

1022
00:56:00,485 --> 00:56:01,570
I did.

1023
00:56:01,653 --> 00:56:04,448
You came up with the ratings?
And you get a 99?

1024
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:06,617
- That's very interesting.
- Yeah?

1025
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,410
What are these, uh, based on?

1026
00:56:08,452 --> 00:56:10,412
It's just a system.
I mean, that's your rating.

1027
00:56:10,454 --> 00:56:12,456
I'm not saying
you're a bad person, Jake.

1028
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:14,708
No, you're just saying
I'm a bad bachelor.

1029
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:16,752
you're a better-than-average
bachelor.

1030
00:56:16,835 --> 00:56:18,295
What -- what are the criteria?

1031
00:56:18,337 --> 00:56:20,714
First, money.
You have none.

1032
00:56:20,797 --> 00:56:22,216
Trust funds don't count
for shit

1033
00:56:22,299 --> 00:56:23,759
because it's a red flag
that says,

1034
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,969
"Mommy and Daddy could turn off
the cash flow one day."

1035
00:56:26,053 --> 00:56:28,055
So that right there keeps you
out of the top 1 0%.

1036
00:56:28,138 --> 00:56:30,390
1 0% of the...gold diggers?

1037
00:56:30,474 --> 00:56:32,768
1 0% period.

1038
00:56:32,768 --> 00:56:34,895
Two...

1039
00:56:34,978 --> 00:56:36,772
you got chronic bad breath.

1040
00:56:36,855 --> 00:56:38,065
No offense,

1041
00:56:38,148 --> 00:56:40,567
but most women won't sleep
with a guy with stank breath,

1042
00:56:40,651 --> 00:56:42,903
so...

1043
00:56:42,986 --> 00:56:44,071
Fuck you.

1044
00:56:44,154 --> 00:56:46,240
You don't have to get
so annoyed, all right?

1045
00:56:46,323 --> 00:56:47,950
What puts you
in the 99th percentile?

1046
00:56:48,033 --> 00:56:49,284
That's what I'm wondering.

1047
00:56:49,368 --> 00:56:52,663
Okay. Well, first of all,
l, um...

1048
00:56:52,704 --> 00:56:53,997
What?

1049
00:56:54,081 --> 00:56:56,542
Besides your salary
and all the money you make.

1050
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:57,751
All right.

1051
00:57:01,171 --> 00:57:04,007
I happen to be blessed
with a very big dick.

1052
00:57:07,594 --> 00:57:09,137
Genetics, man.

1053
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:12,140
Doesn't dyeing your hair
drop you down a few places?

1054
00:57:12,224 --> 00:57:13,767
Nope. Not at all.

1055
00:57:13,851 --> 00:57:15,853
Only bothers women
if it bothers me.

1056
00:57:15,936 --> 00:57:16,979
Going gray does bother you.

1057
00:57:17,062 --> 00:57:18,397
- No, it doesn't.
- Of course it does.

1058
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,566
If it didn't bother you,
you wouldn't smear that goop

1059
00:57:20,607 --> 00:57:22,568
all over your scalp
10 billion times a day.

1060
00:57:22,609 --> 00:57:24,653
Hey, it's a non-issue, Jake.

1061
00:57:24,695 --> 00:57:27,030
Well, are table manners
an issue?

1062
00:57:27,114 --> 00:57:29,867
See that silver thing
to the left of your plate?

1063
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:32,160
- That's called a fork.
- Mm-hmm.

1064
00:57:32,244 --> 00:57:34,788
And when people eat rice,
they use chopsticks or a fork.

1065
00:57:34,872 --> 00:57:38,208
Yeah, and grown people
don't eat...fried rice

1066
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:39,585
with their bare hands.

1067
00:57:41,211 --> 00:57:42,754
You don't know how to behave.

1068
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:44,506
You're busting my balls
on the way I eat?

1069
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:46,008
You spend the whole week

1070
00:57:46,049 --> 00:57:47,926
figuring out how to defraud
foreign governments --

1071
00:57:47,968 --> 00:57:50,679
whatever you do --
and then you get out of there

1072
00:57:50,762 --> 00:57:52,347
and you go out
to the strange world

1073
00:57:52,431 --> 00:57:56,059
outside your office
called reality...

1074
00:57:56,101 --> 00:57:58,270
and you don't know
how to behave.

1075
00:58:00,981 --> 00:58:02,608
- Oh, yeah?
- I rest my case.

1076
00:58:02,649 --> 00:58:05,027
You gonna tell me
about reality?

1077
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:07,529
Jacob, you're a rich Jewish kid
from the Upper East Side

1078
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:09,198
who's ashamed of his wealth.

1079
00:58:10,782 --> 00:58:13,327
You walk around unhappy 24-7

1080
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:16,496
trying to make up for the fact
that you were born privileged.

1081
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,081
Fuck that.

1082
00:58:18,165 --> 00:58:19,374
You know what?

1083
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:23,378
That's just some knee-jerk
liberalism bullshit, man.

1084
00:58:23,462 --> 00:58:25,047
You call that reality?

1085
00:58:33,138 --> 00:58:34,848
So what's Monty?

1086
00:58:37,351 --> 00:58:38,644
Let's see.

1087
00:58:42,397 --> 00:58:44,483
Monty's going to prison.

1088
00:58:44,566 --> 00:58:47,528
He's a doughnut --
big, fat zero.

1089
00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:51,073
Yo.

1090
00:58:51,156 --> 00:58:53,617
Let's not go to practice.
Just today.

1091
00:58:53,659 --> 00:58:55,244
So don't go.

1092
00:58:55,327 --> 00:58:56,703
Let's go to my house.

1093
00:58:58,163 --> 00:58:59,540
Come on, Nat. Let's go.

1094
00:58:59,665 --> 00:59:02,459
My mother won't be home
till late, either.

1095
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:03,794
And there's food.

1096
00:59:03,877 --> 00:59:05,546
Good, 'cause I ain't got
no money.

1097
00:59:05,629 --> 00:59:06,547
Vito's home.

1098
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:07,548
So?

1099
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:08,632
What's that?

1100
00:59:08,715 --> 00:59:10,801
Nothing. I don't care.

1101
00:59:10,884 --> 00:59:12,469
You don't care, Nat?

1102
00:59:12,553 --> 00:59:13,762
What do you mean now?

1103
00:59:13,846 --> 00:59:14,888
Yeah, right.

1104
00:59:14,972 --> 00:59:16,765
You know
you likededed him forever.

1105
00:59:16,807 --> 00:59:18,183
I never likededed him.

1106
00:59:18,225 --> 00:59:19,768
You're always trying to
hook us up

1107
00:59:19,768 --> 00:59:21,687
because you want me to be
your sister-in-law,

1108
00:59:21,728 --> 00:59:22,896
but it ain't never happening.

1109
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:25,065
Don't front
like you don't likededed him.

1110
00:59:25,148 --> 00:59:26,984
Nat, please, okay?

1111
00:59:27,067 --> 00:59:29,027
Every day you come
to my house --

1112
00:59:29,069 --> 00:59:30,404
"Vito, walk me home" --

1113
00:59:30,487 --> 00:59:32,614
Every day?
What kind of bullshit is that?

1114
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:34,116
Anyway, he's always with
that girl.

1115
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:36,118
- What's up, Simon?
- Monty, how you doing?

1116
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:38,579
- Good to see you, man.
- Good to see you.

1117
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:39,746
Who's that?

1118
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:41,790
It's a new guy.
He's Golden. He's good.

1119
00:59:41,874 --> 00:59:43,125
Now, you know what I told you.

1120
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:44,877
He's big.
It's like, "Beep, beep" --

1121
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,503
back up your truck, man,
you know what I'm saying?

1122
00:59:46,545 --> 00:59:48,213
All right, Simon. I'll handle
my business, all right?

1123
00:59:48,297 --> 00:59:50,549
- Just trying to help.
- All right. Take it easy.

1124
00:59:50,632 --> 00:59:52,759
When did he break up
with her?

1125
00:59:52,801 --> 00:59:54,595
Like a month ago.

1126
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:56,096
But she don't stop.

1127
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:58,682
She calls the house,
she calls, she hangs up.

1128
00:59:58,765 --> 01:00:00,267
Please. Please.

1129
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:02,019
Did he break up with her,
or she broke up with him?

1130
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:03,353
He needs somebody good.

1131
01:00:03,437 --> 01:00:05,105
Excuse me.

1132
01:00:05,189 --> 01:00:06,815
- Why doesn't he --
- Excuse me.

1133
01:00:06,899 --> 01:00:08,817
- You got a light?
- What?

1134
01:00:08,901 --> 01:00:11,111
Can I borrow your lighter
for a second?

1135
01:00:17,868 --> 01:00:19,036
Thanks a lot.

1136
01:00:22,414 --> 01:00:23,540
What's he doing?

1137
01:00:23,582 --> 01:00:24,750
He's loco.

1138
01:00:29,713 --> 01:00:32,758
Yo, I've met you before,
haven't l?

1139
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:34,801
You do look familiar to me.
How do I know you?

1140
01:00:34,885 --> 01:00:36,762
Yeah. You were in
my brother's class.

1141
01:00:36,845 --> 01:00:37,596
Pete.

1142
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:40,599
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I know who you are.

1143
01:00:40,682 --> 01:00:43,602
Yo, Nat, come on.
Let's go.

1144
01:00:43,685 --> 01:00:44,853
We got practice.

1145
01:00:44,895 --> 01:00:46,021
I'll catch up.

1146
01:00:46,104 --> 01:00:47,564
Yeah, all right.

1147
01:00:47,648 --> 01:00:48,899
Whatever.

1148
01:00:48,941 --> 01:00:50,651
You stupid.

1149
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:53,278
- What do you got practice for?
- Basketball.

1150
01:00:53,362 --> 01:00:55,322
Seriously? You play?

1151
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:57,741
Come on.
What are you, a guard?

1152
01:00:57,783 --> 01:00:58,742
Three spot.

1153
01:00:58,784 --> 01:01:01,370
You play small forward?
No shit?

1154
01:01:01,495 --> 01:01:04,248
That means you're strong
and quick.

1155
01:01:04,248 --> 01:01:06,667
I play the one -- point.

1156
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:08,168
You skip too many
of these things,

1157
01:01:08,252 --> 01:01:09,711
they'll give you the boot --
for real.

1158
01:01:09,795 --> 01:01:11,046
I just want to finish
my cigarette.

1159
01:01:11,088 --> 01:01:13,215
Funny. You don't --
I don't know.

1160
01:01:13,257 --> 01:01:15,551
I wouldn't have made you
for a ballplayer, you know?

1161
01:01:15,634 --> 01:01:17,594
You look more like a...

1162
01:01:17,678 --> 01:01:20,681
Iike a...runner,
like a track star.

1163
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:23,058
Where you from?

1164
01:01:25,936 --> 01:01:28,188
No, I mean -- you from Uptown?

1165
01:01:28,272 --> 01:01:30,190
U.F.A.?
You on a scholarship?

1166
01:01:30,274 --> 01:01:32,192
What, I can't be
from Riverdale?

1167
01:01:32,276 --> 01:01:36,113
You can be from wherever
you want. Just...curious.

1168
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:40,409
I didn't mean nothing.
I was just...

1169
01:01:40,492 --> 01:01:42,744
You know, l-I was
on scholarship, too.

1170
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:45,205
It's a good thing.
You -- you're lucky.

1171
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,083
What -- what's your name?

1172
01:01:48,166 --> 01:01:49,001
Nat? Natalie?

1173
01:01:49,084 --> 01:01:50,544
- Naturelle.
- Naturelle?

1174
01:01:50,627 --> 01:01:52,921
Are you serious?

1175
01:01:54,006 --> 01:01:56,675
Naturelle.
Wow. I like that name.

1176
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:01,930
How old are you?

1177
01:02:02,014 --> 01:02:03,932
18.

1178
01:02:03,974 --> 01:02:05,267
Are you 18?

1179
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:07,644
- Why?
- 'Cause it's not every day

1180
01:02:07,728 --> 01:02:10,022
I meet a girl as pretty as you
who plays the three spot.

1181
01:02:10,105 --> 01:02:11,231
That's deadly.

1182
01:02:13,233 --> 01:02:15,819
- How old are you?
- I'm old enough to have to ask.

1183
01:02:15,903 --> 01:02:17,863
You're too old to be
hanging out on the playground.

1184
01:02:17,905 --> 01:02:19,781

I wasn't hanging out.

1185
01:02:19,865 --> 01:02:22,326
I was...
I was passing by.

1186
01:02:22,367 --> 01:02:24,411
What if I was 17?

1187
01:02:26,496 --> 01:02:28,749
It might shorten
the conversation a little.

1188
01:02:28,832 --> 01:02:32,252
But you're not. You're 18,
so we got no problem.

1189
01:02:41,011 --> 01:02:43,722
What do you say I come
and see you play sometime?

1190
01:02:45,224 --> 01:02:47,017
Seriously. I'd like to.

1191
01:02:49,394 --> 01:02:50,646
Maybe.

1192
01:02:50,687 --> 01:02:52,064
Maybe?

1193
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:54,983
Okay.

1194
01:02:55,067 --> 01:02:57,528
I'll be the one behind the bench
yelling, "Get back on 'D'!"

1195
01:02:59,446 --> 01:03:00,697
See ya.

1196
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:09,998
Hey.

1197
01:03:10,082 --> 01:03:12,000
Come out here
and meet somebody.

1198
01:03:12,084 --> 01:03:13,669
Who's that?

1199
01:03:13,752 --> 01:03:16,004
She's just the girl for you.

1200
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:24,847
Hey, Jody.

1201
01:03:24,847 --> 01:03:26,431
You back there?

1202
01:03:26,473 --> 01:03:27,724
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, sweetie.

1203
01:03:27,808 --> 01:03:29,017
How you doing?

1204
01:03:29,101 --> 01:03:30,227
- Hi.
- Hi.

1205
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:32,354
Is this your little brother,
Frank? He's a cutie.

1206
01:03:32,437 --> 01:03:34,523
Don't bother with me.
I'm in the 62nd percentile.

1207
01:03:34,606 --> 01:03:36,650
Oh. That's probably because
you don't work on Wall Street.

1208
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:38,235
The scale is skewed
to the money thing.

1209
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:40,737
- Everybody knows about this.
- Everybody knows.

1210
01:03:40,779 --> 01:03:41,905
Anybody at this bar.

1211
01:03:46,368 --> 01:03:47,411
You see that ass?

1212
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:49,371
- She's beautiful.
- Mm-hmm.

1213
01:03:51,415 --> 01:03:52,583
Man.

1214
01:03:55,878 --> 01:03:57,838
One of the guys at school --

1215
01:03:57,921 --> 01:04:01,258
this, uh, biology teacher,
Terry --

1216
01:04:01,383 --> 01:04:03,135
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you ever meet Terry?

1217
01:04:03,177 --> 01:04:04,678
No, I don't think so.

1218
01:04:05,888 --> 01:04:09,224
Anyway, he, uh, he --
he really likes this girl.

1219
01:04:09,308 --> 01:04:11,226
- Like a student?
- A student.

1220
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:12,561
-
- Yeah.

1221
01:04:12,644 --> 01:04:14,479
- A junior.
- Oh, man.

1222
01:04:14,563 --> 01:04:17,608
I mean, the girl's 16,
17, maybe.

1223
01:04:17,649 --> 01:04:18,775
I don't know.

1224
01:04:18,859 --> 01:04:20,611
Uh, she's not really pretty,

1225
01:04:20,694 --> 01:04:24,323
um...not in the, uh,
classical sense,

1226
01:04:24,406 --> 01:04:26,241
but she...

1227
01:04:28,076 --> 01:04:30,621
I don't know.
She's -- she's got something.

1228
01:04:30,704 --> 01:04:31,997
- You know.
- Mm-hmm.

1229
01:04:34,541 --> 01:04:37,628
I told Terry, you know, to just
forget about it, you know?

1230
01:04:37,711 --> 01:04:39,254
He's kind of obsessing,

1231
01:04:39,338 --> 01:04:42,466
and it's kind of scary
the way he talks about it.

1232
01:04:42,549 --> 01:04:47,179
But he's like...
"Five years from now,

1233
01:04:47,262 --> 01:04:49,181
"she'll almost be out
of college.
