00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,439
Good luck to all you students
on your finals.

10
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,169
before you hit the bars.

11
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,507
Hi handsome.

14
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:55,907
A small isolation study

15
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:57,905
measuring all potential side
effects.

16
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:59,907
There will be five doses of
the drug,

17
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,943
given in two day intervals

18
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,618
physical exams

19
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,553
Because I'm...
- No, I just...

20
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,450
Not happening.

21
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,523
Well, let's take a look.

22
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,155
Here we are.

23
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,834
No prostate exams, tape tests,
or anal winks.

24
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,301
No probes, enemas,
or rectal tubes.

25
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,165
I don't know what an anal
wink is, but,

26
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,135
I prefer not to have it.
- Me either.

27
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,141
Feel free to review the protocol
yourselves.

28
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,644
Ravexin Pharmaceutical presents
RXZ-19.

29
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,447
The promise of the future.

30
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,482
Okay. What's it for?

31
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,591
As for compensation...

32
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,859
Subjects will receive $225
a day.

33
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,623
$225 a day... that's like...

34
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,198
It's $3,000.

35
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,096
To be precise, it's $3,150.

36
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,169
We'll do it.

37
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,903
So we miss a couple classes.
Big deal.

38
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,976
(inaudible) is overrated
anyways.

39
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:09,704
Man, we're gonna miss Christmas
break.

40
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,644
C'mon. Fuck Christmas break.

41
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,087
we make some easy, EASY money,

42
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,360
and then come summertime,

43
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,030
we can go on a real vacation.

44
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,631
Europe.

45
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,663
And even you can get laid
there.

46
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,536
How many girls have you slept
with?

47
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,263
Many... one.

48
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,803
Yeah. We're doing it.

49
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,242
RXZ-19 is a theta class molecule

50
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,914
in the search for wide grade
antihistamine.

51
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,520
Okay, here we go. Including...

52
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,522
Nausea, dry mouth,

53
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,388
arrhythmia,

54
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,494
constipation and or diarrhea?

55
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,392
Can you even have both at
the same time?

56
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,826
And why are you even reading
that?

57
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,900
RXZ-19? Allergies?

58
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,731
C'mon.

59
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,441
Are you kidding me?

60
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,272
Because we were short on beer
money?

61
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,310
They paid us what? $20?

62
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,141
To play that game with all
the weird rules?

63
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:23,886
So?

64
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,994
This is-this is... Ravexin
Pharmaceutical, man.

65
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,961
They sold $14 billion in drugs
last year!

66
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,531
Good. Good.

67
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,303
Because she's paying us $3,150.

68
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:45,304
I dunno. This is...

69
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,341
By the way.

70
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,104
That doc...

71
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,976
She is a babe.

72
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,349
The best things in life
are free,

73
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,120
But you can take it to the
bird sand bees.

74
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,782
I need money.

75
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,789
What I want.
That's what I want.

76
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,629
What I want.
That's what I want.

77
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,794
What I want.

78
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,904
That's what I want.

79
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,936
(inaudible)

80
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,971
Your love gives me such
a thrill.

81
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,139
But your love don't pay
my bills.

82
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,511
I need money.

83
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,648
That's what I want.

84
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,796
Can't be any worse than our
dorm.

85
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,500
Right, right.

86
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,498
And think about the money.
- Yeah.

87
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,329
And Europe.

88
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,672
(Music)

89
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,808
Right this way, gentlemen.

90
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,813
if you please.

91
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,020
Put your bags on the table here.

92
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,882
Both of em.
- Alright.

93
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:08,092
And those cells. Lemme have
those cells.

94
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,090
Yeah. Yours too.

95
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:11,796
Okay.

96
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,194
No pictures allowed in the
facility.

97
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,700
What are you guys looking for?

98
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,802
The usual: dope, junk food,

99
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,869
cameras, cell phones.

100
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,670
And liquor.

101
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,708
Wait, are you serious?
I can't have that?

102
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,413
I didn't see that in the
pamphlet.

103
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,205
Yeah. We'll hang onto this
for you.

104
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,917
You can get it back when your
trial's over.

105
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,889
Patty, they're all yours.

106
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,840
(Door buzzes open)

107
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,322
(Door clangs shut)

108
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,437
Mind the clock.

109
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,933
Lights out at 2200 hours.

110
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,839
10 PM?

111
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,145
I mean, are we in elementary
school?

112
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,720
Okay!

113
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,480
The mattress is shit.

114
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:46,725
The view's shit.

115
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,254
On your daddy's yacht?

116
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,302
Name's Nigel.
- Greg.

117
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,731
Rob.

118
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,597
You guys look like first timers.

119
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,432
Is it that obvious?

120
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,144
Me, on the other hand.

121
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,971
The resume speaks for itself.

122
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,203
Holy shit!

123
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,679
All in the name of science.

124
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,153
Right. That's enough about me.

125
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,357
Sweet.

126
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,659
Cameras. Note the cameras.

127
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,523
You see, the powers that be have

128
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,528
So, quite simply, we are
monitored.

129
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,394
24/7, seriously.

130
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,805
C'mon. C'mon. C'mon.

131
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,564
This thing is being a bit of
a pesterance.

132
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,468
So this is it. Next stop.

133
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,041
Med wing.

134
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,109
This is it. This is where
you gotta be.

135
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,979
do the skin scratchy bullocks.

136
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,687
Take a look, just down there.

137
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,685
That leads to the lab
downstairs.

138
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,518
Do all their dirty work.

139
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:56,762
[Skipped item nr. 139]

140
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:01,367
There's more! There's more!
C'mon! C'mon!

141
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,003
It's a run over.

142
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,003
You see? They call it a run over.

143
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,711
But the problem was, after about
a week,

144
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,577
everyone started getting the...

145
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,719
The shakes, the twitches.

146
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,392
But they leave shaking so
bloody much,

147
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,495
they can't even zip up their
own fly.

148
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,562
You've gotta love it.

149
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,066
Oh, hey hey. What's up with...

150
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,895
What's up with that guy?

151
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,662
Must be the placebo.

152
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,208
But just dosing him with like,
the...

153
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:45,876
The sugar water.

154
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,046
It's a fake. A fuckin' phoney.

155
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,077
A phoney, phoney pony!

156
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,084
Nono no no no.

157
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,417
The group is small. Can't
afford it.

158
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,423
Can't afford to waste one
of us. Nope.

159
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,556
Then again,

160
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,264
Nono no no no.

161
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,433
(Inaudible)
It's all a test. All a test.

162
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,037
See...

163
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:16,397
Alright.
- Thanks a lot.

164
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,210
Well, he's kind of a wacko.

165
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,413
That was interesting.
- Yeah.

166
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,239
To say the least.

167
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,450
Hello ladies. Lovely day.

168
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,639
(Music)

169
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,310
The boys, the boys! The lads,
the lads!

170
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,816
Welcome to your last supper.

171
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,254
Rob and Greg, meet Linnea
the beautiful.

172
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,555
Hi.

00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,128
Hey Stacy. Greg.

00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:16,493
Hi.

00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,363
There is Montell.

176
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,605
That there is Ira. A fine
figure of a man.

177
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,308
That there is... Maggie.

178
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,135
Hey. Greg.
- How are you doing?

179
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:27,504
This is Rob.
- How are ya?

180
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,272
And our resident bloody game
masters,

181
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,141
Hoy, and Benal.

182
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:33,851
Sup guys?

183
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,681
Do you guys know if there's
any forks?

184
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:38,380
Forks?
- Yeah.

185
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:40,147
What do you need forks for?
It's pizza.

186
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,155
Lemme getcha.

187
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,157
Here ya go.
- Oh. Thanks.

188
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,988
You're welcome.

189
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,498
Is food really gonna be that
bad in here?

190
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,278
Are you a vegetarian?
- No.

191
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,348
I'm vegan. I'm green all
the way.

192
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,184
It's revolting.
- Oh God! Not again.

193
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:12,856
Okay.

194
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,890
Makes me what? Less of a man,
right?

195
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,655
Okay. Here's the little piggy's
eyes.

196
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,560
Here's the little piggy's lips.

197
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,793
Like an old married couple, huh?

198
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,731
Okay. Great.

199
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,240
Hey. Cool ink, man.

200
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,240
Where'd you get it? Army?
Navy?

201
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,013
Prison.

202
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,412
Buthe informed me he's a
changed man.

203
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,817
Thanks to our Lord,
Jesus Christ.

204
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,219
Amen.

205
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,259
Yeah. Amen. Totally.

206
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,068
We do not belong here.

207
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,404
Does toothpaste expire?

208
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,401
Cause this shit is fuckin'
terrible.

209
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,403
Dude I am fuckin' serious,
Greg. Okay?

210
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,303
We don't belong here.

211
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,113
Plus, that blonde chick.

212
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,610
She was eye fuckin' me the
whole time.

213
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,112
Dude, is sex all you think
about?

214
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,151
Yeah? Don't you?

215
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,758
Yeah. All the time, man.

216
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,584
All the time.

217
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,986
(Unidentifiable Shrieking)

218
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,061
Dude, what the fuck was that?

219
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,998
Sounded like two animals...

220
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,998
...like, going at it.

221
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,331
(Screaming)

222
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,328
Back off!
- Backing off.

223
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,059
Sup?

224
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,033
What is going on here?

225
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,036
This guy attacked me.

226
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,576
Aaron is our lab technician.

227
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,218
May he continue?

228
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,253
Hey Rob, it's just a needle.

229
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,459
Stop being such a pussy.

230
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,431
Okay.

231
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,165
I'll help you.

232
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,270
Interesting.

233
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,069
Not good.

234
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,974
Oh. Here we go.

235
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,875
Ah!

236
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,878
Sorry.

237
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,017
Man up, dude.

238
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,789
You're next.

239
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:36,929
(Snoring)

240
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:37,918
(Snoring)

241
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,459
Supmate.

242
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,595
She's watching.

243
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,360
What's up with all the bran?

244
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,264
It keeps everything moving.

245
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,098
In case the drug clogs you up.

246
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,947
Those eyes, they're watching.

247
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,274
What the hell? There's a hair
in my food.

248
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,117
Oh God, that is gross.

249
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,121
Gross? What are you talking
about?

250
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,123
It's natural. Even girls do it.

251
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,063
I don't.

252
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,131
Hello.

253
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,839
Do tell, do tell, do tell.

254
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,938
It's just chemistry. It's the...

255
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,506
But I'm really bad at science.

256
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,350
It's driving me crazy.

257
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,490
No! Rob-Rob could help you.

258
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,488
He's a...

259
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,354
...a whiz at chemistry.

260
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,694
He could tutor you.

261
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:47,488
Are you really?

262
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,166
Oh my God, yes.

263
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,993
Total prodigy, this kid.

264
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,329
He actually just got accepted
to...

265
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,335
...to MIT, for grad school.

266
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,166
Hey. Y'know, it was kinda...

267
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,240
He's a whiz at it

268
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,510
It's really not like that.

269
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,511
You got into MIT?
- Yeah.

270
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,550
Boy Wonder, right here.

271
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,184
Okay. Well can you really help
me then?

272
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,858
It's kinda been a while.

273
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,791
He actually would love to.

274
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,298
He's the most helpful person

275
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:22,830
that I know.

276
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,201
Okay.

277
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,269
Fine. So maybe after lunch?

278
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,007
We can study?
- Yeah. Sure.

279
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,834
I could try.

280
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,146
(Screaming)

281
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,412
Hey, hey! I got it!

282
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,815
I got it. It's good.

283
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,148
Thanks.
- Yeah.

284
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,525
That is not okay.

285
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,526
(inaudible)

286
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,526
M I fucking T? Dude?
- It worked, didn't it?

287
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,460
Yeah. But I'm not a fucking
genius.

288
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:56,928
Okay?

289
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,567
It's impossible.

290
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,294
You gotta roll with it. Done.

291
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,239
Gentlemen. Dosing room.

292
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,306
Remember to dress accordingly.

293
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,540
Accordingly?

294
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,242
This isn't so...
- Stop it.

295
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,283
This really isn't...
- Just stop it.

296
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,517
Just shut up.

297
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,088
We're just wearing dresses.

298
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,953
Just clam up, alright?

299
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,696
Don't cry, sweetheart.

300
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,296
Daddy has to do this.

301
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:36,073
I'll be home soon, sweetie.

302
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,402
Rob.

303
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,411
Yeah. That's me. Alright.

304
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,779
Go get em.

305
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,327
Temp.

306
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,505
(Machines beeping)

307
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,152
RXZ insertion at 10:21.

308
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,864
Run the IV rate at 150cc per
hour.

309
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:35,827
And be aware the drug may
feel...

310
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,365
Cold.

311
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:38,660
Up and down my arm.

312
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:43,672
You'll warm up shortly.

313
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,342
Okay.

314
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,374
Blood draws every 10 minutes.

315
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,884
Alright.

316
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,018
Hey doc.

317
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,027
Long time, no see.
- Gregory.

318
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,233
You were a mermaid.

319
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,971
You were singing to me.

320
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,202
You had the voice of an angel.

321
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,937
RXZ-19 insertion at 11:21.

322
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,712
Run the IV rate at 150cc
per hour.

323
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,712
No, that's not my point. All
I'm saying is...

324
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,714
She makes me feel like a
naughty boy.

325
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,648
But she's... she's 60.

326
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,388
She's awesome

327
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,221
So you like the older women?

328
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,997
Hey, how'd it go?

329
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,901
Rob...
- Rob.

330
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,896
I dunno. Do I detect a little
lover's tiff?

331
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,166
Has it all gone wrong?
Within these walls?

332
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,070
Has it pulled you apart?
- Uh oh.

333
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,075
It's alright. He'll come about.

334
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,111
No.
- Would that be a problem?

335
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:59,414
Where are you off to?

336
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,278
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

337
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,316
I think that fiber just hit
my system.

338
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,784
Oh mate.

339
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,889
You've never had a mate like
this before.

340
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,457
Good luck.

341
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,619
Thanks.

342
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,778
(inaudible)

343
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,883
It'll have to wait.

344
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,950
Greg. Hi.
- Hey.

345
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:07,981
Did you just have a bowel
movement?

346
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,285
Yeah.

347
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,149
I did.
- Great.

348
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,018
On a scale of 1 to 10,

349
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,963
1 being the easiest,

350
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,994
and 10 being the most difficult.

351
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,666
Okay. Yeah.

352
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,562
Let's say... 4.

353
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:26,531
Write down a 4.

354
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,500
4.

355
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,173
Okay.

356
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,070
In your own words,

357
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,943
Quality. Well, there wasn't
much quantity.

358
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,350
But the quality was good.

359
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,418
I've never had to...

360
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,154
...articulate this before.

361
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,225
Just try.

362
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:52,190
Well formed.

363
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,864
Solid.

364
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,361
Stringy.

365
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:59,834
No pain upon release, so...

366
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,902
Thumbs up.

367
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,306
I just wiped, and wiped.

368
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,875
How long?

369
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,478
I'm not gonna answer this.

370
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,545
Feel free to use a metaphor.

371
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,250
Like a thick oil.

372
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,213
Like a dirty oil.
- Dirty oil.

373
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,887
Like hard?
- Cloudy.

374
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,555
Not talking about it.

375
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,257
How about sound?

376
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:37,003
I just appreciate you helping
me so much.

377
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,240
Well hey, no problem.

378
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,004
I'm sorry. I just...

379
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,089
Thank you.
- Piece of cake.

380
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,791
It's what I do.

381
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,822
Yeah. Alright see ya.
- Okay bye.

382
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:01,588
So?

383
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,027
What?

384
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:07,432
Greg, alright. It's not like
that.

385
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,537
It was like a beautiful melding
of intellect.

386
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,612
You're not safe. Save yourself.
- What?!

387
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,612
Everything. They get inside
your head.

388
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,512
Save yourself.

389
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:24,114
Save yourself! NO! NO!

390
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,880
LET ME GO!

391
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:29,283
LET ME GO! YOU CAN'T DO THIS!

392
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:32,119
NO!

393
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,332
LET ME GO!

394
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,964
NO!

395
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,793
Hey. What happened?

396
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,628
We found PCP in his blood.

397
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,304
He's a drug addict.

398
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,644
Except, of course,

399
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,972
the night before, they do that
one last hit,

400
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,876
just to say goodbye and then...

401
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,150
Hey Stacy. Crazy Stacy.

402
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:00,647
Rob.

403
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,484
You're bleeding.
- What?

404
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,173
I'll finish up here, Patty.

405
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,480
Hey.

406
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:31,288
Everything okay?

407
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,658
Everything's fine.

408
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:37,017
Just be sure not to itch it.

409
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,889
And you'll be good as new.

410
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:42,165
What about me?

411
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,924
Doc, cause I have a...

412
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,897
I have a little cut here.

413
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,901
Y'know, it's a little...
Here's some antiseptic.

414
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,309
Okay.

415
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,647
Hey, Doctor Wilcox.

416
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,016
What's gonna happen to Ira?

417
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,678
Wesenthim down the road
to the ER.

418
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,051
The doctors there will take
good care of him.

419
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:09,919
Don't you think?

420
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,555
You guys have had a long night.

421
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,232
Get some sleep.

422
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:30,847
(Whistling)

423
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,914
(Screaming)

424
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,206
Hello, doctor.

425
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,809
Hello.

426
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,876
Today we're going to be
performing

427
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,979
scratch tests on your skin

428
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,377
to determine your baseline
allergic response.

429
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,718
Next, we take our allergen
samples from

430
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,650
core source material.

431
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:06,869
Oww.

432
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,634
Oh shit.

433
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,115
(Music)

434
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,925
Fuckin' allergy medicine my ass.

435
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,315
(Growling and screaming)

436
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:08,561
Okay. It better not end up
online.

437
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,663
I was kidding.

438
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,743
Okay, so. You were attacked...

439
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:22,306
in the shower...

440
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,378
...by a rat?

441
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,647
Yes. By a giant fucking rat.

442
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,546
This thing was on like,
steroids and shit.

443
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:39,153
Something's not right here.

444
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,921
Something is fucked up.

445
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,826
What's up with all the tests?

446
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,832
I've just got a bad feeling
in my gut.

447
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,005
I'm just... I dunno. So...

448
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,665
Oh my God.

449
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,673
There's a worm in my food.

450
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,573
There's a worm in my food.

451
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:58,505
I've got a worm in my food!

452
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,843
Does anyone else have a problem?

453
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,916
Please. Check carefully.

454
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:06,289
I found one.

455
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,687
Me too.

456
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,226
One but... wait...

457
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,731
What the fuck is wrong with
this place?

458
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,731
I will report this to
Dr. Wilcox.

459
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,205
Empty your trays, please.

460
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,885
Oh, dude.

461
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,987
Does it flinch or anything?

462
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,055
What are you guys doing?

463
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,559
Looks like we found your rat.

464
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:49,499
Check out its scars. They are
so cool.

465
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,903
I wonder where it came from.

466
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:03,076
To every thing, there is a
season.

467
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,009
I think someone should tell
Aaron.

468
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,914
Time for your next doses,
not recreation.

469
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,449
C'mon.

470
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,800
I am thinking that it is... B.

471
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:32,372
B.

472
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,938
You are incorrect.
- Damn it.

473
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,976
It's close, but not right.
- What is it?

474
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,946
It's actually C.
Synthesis.

475
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:43,212
Oh God. Why is it so hard
for me?

476
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:45,486
Why is this so easy for you?

477
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:47,622
I wouldn't say easy.
- No?

478
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,486
It's more like...

479
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,485
...practiced.

480
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,287
Yeah. Practiced.

481
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:55,993
That whole MIT thing.
That wasn't...

482
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,193
What?

483
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,927
I... I don't really go to MIT.

484
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,867
It's... it... the point is...

485
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,010
I've done internships, y'know.

486
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,641
Okay, well, at least all your
hard work is...

487
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,817
...coming into good use.

488
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,747
Well yeah, I guess.

489
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,421
It's not like that, no.
It's just...

490
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:22,818
I dunno. It's...

491
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,799
I've been okay with that,
y'know?

492
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:36,734
I've never really questioned it.

493
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:39,340
I dunno. It's weird.

494
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:42,542
For some reason,

495
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,577
now it's like I feel...

496
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,746
Like what?

497
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,551
I feel free.

498
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,993
Completely free.

499
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,860
Me too.

500
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,622
Me too.

501
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:09,101
Woo! Oh my God!

502
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,001
(Laughing)

503
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,212
Let me.

504
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:38,459
(Music)

505
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,080
(Music)

506
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:19,935
(Music)

507
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,893
What is that smell?

508
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:17,160
(Gagging)

509
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:22,062
Who's been eating this?

510
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:26,767
Who has been eating this animal?

511
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,588
This is very dangerous.

512
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:49,923
A dead animal is full of
bacteria.

513
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,924
You need to tell me right now.

514
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,858
(Glass shattering)

515
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:57,400
Montell?

516
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,770
Someone help me.

517
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:05,272
Take him to the medical lab.

518
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,079
Hold him down.

519
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:11,941
Hold him down.

520
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:16,686
Alright, alright, alright.

521
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,354
(Screaming)

522
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:20,079
Fuck me! He's got my hand.

523
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,087
Get him off! Get him off!

524
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:23,623
Fuck me!

525
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,238
Dr. Wilcox.

526
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,551
Immediately.

527
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,818
Dr. Wilcox says you should
get to sleep.

528
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,279
In the morning? You kidding me?

529
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,050
Can you believe this shit?

530
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,562
Greg. You heard her.

531
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,425
Go to sleep.

532
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:48,844
(Music)

533
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,630
(Music)

534
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:22,443
(Electronic beeping)

535
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,021
(Music)

536
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:54,209
(Music)

537
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:13,464

538
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:14,226

539
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:34,249
(Music)

540
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:41,123
(Dogs barking)

541
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,637
(Barking gets louder)

542
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:06,816
(Angry hissing and barking)

543
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,730
Hello Gregory.
- Okay...

544
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,141
I need you in my office
immediately.

545
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,844
You need to stay calm. Okay?

546
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,710
What's going on here?

547
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,578
What... What are you doing
to me?

548
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:44,548
We're not doing anything to you.

549
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:53,723
Don't you fuckin' mind fuck
me alright?

550
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,591
I wasn't hallucinating.

551
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:59,596
We can talk it over.

552
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,531
Just stay calm.

553
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:03,205
Stay back, alright?

554
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,611
Y'know what? Fine! HOLD ON!

555
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:09,713
Fine. Then I'm gonna show you.
- Greg, don't!

556
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:11,146
You see this?

557
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:14,377
Fuck! You see that?

558
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:16,245
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

559
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,148
Catch him. He's gonna faint.

560
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:20,049
You see that? Nothing...

561
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:21,917
Greg...

562
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,759
Stop. Stop!

563
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,833
You're still woozy from the
anesthetic.

564
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:40,641
I'm the placebo.

565
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:44,604
Tell me, Greg.

566
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,645
What do you know about the
liver?

567
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,422
Like starfish in the ocean,

568
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,827
and under the right conditions,

569
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:04,067
regrow each piece to a perfect
whole.

570
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:10,796
This is a sample of normal
blood cells.

571
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,565
Take a look.

572
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,675
With ammonium hydroxide,

573
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:17,777
I'm going to erode the cell
walls.

574
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,847
That sample was from your body,
Greg.

575
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:31,688
And this...

576
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:34,426
...is from Nigel.

577
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:38,495
His cells are already infused
with RXZ-19.

578
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:54,581
Extraordinary, isn't it?

579
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:56,547
In all our testing,

580
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,617
I've never seen cells regenerate
so quickly.

581
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:00,483
Not even in our animal subjects.

582
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:02,886
Follow me.

583
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,398
This is Alexandra.

584
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,499
She won't win any beauty prizes,

585
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:15,534
but she's special in her own
rite.

586
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,570
Alexandra was our first animal
subject

587
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:19,638
to achieve 100% regeneration.

588
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:27,874
But with time,

589
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,881
we began to regrow muscle,

590
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,883
blood vessels,
even nerve tissue.

591
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,383
The heart, lungs, even the
brain.

592
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,424
It's only a matter of time.

593
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,662
(Meowing)

594
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:45,326
What'd you do to her neck?

595
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:47,434
Our most recent success.

596
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:49,865
I personally severed her carotid
artery.

597
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:53,202
Quite the resilient one,
aren't you?

598
00:46:57,781 --> 00:46:59,715
With Alexandra's regenerative
abilities,

599
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,747
came other changes.

600
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,087
She began to have more tolerance
for filth,

601
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,284
Have a seat.

602
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:16,732
Disgust had disappeared.

603
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:19,168
What do you mean "disgust"?

604
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:25,309
Or more importantly,
what purpose it serves.

605
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:27,903
The answer is rooted in our
survival, Greg.

606
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,706
protects us from bacteria.

607
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:40,385
keeps us from performing acts
that likewise

608
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:42,387
threaten the life of our
species.

609
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:47,122
the more hormones flooded into
her system,

610
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:51,594
It was too powerful for its
protections.

611
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,532
and then ate them.

612
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,504
First,

613
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:03,973
we must understand RXZ-19.

614
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:06,282
And then we must control it.

615
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,982
Yeah. Oh, I do. I do.

616
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,988
But first of all,
I just have to say one thing.

617
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,990
This is not what I signed
up for.

618
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,992
Greg, I can assure you.

619
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,858
You're completely safe.

620
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:24,623
And how about the others? Huh?

621
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:26,665
How are they gonna react?

622
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,168
That's what I thought.
You have no idea.

623
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,407
You have no right to fuck with
people.

624
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,581
That's very noble of you, Greg,

625
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:43,479
but they already know.

626
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:06,342
and how significant our work
here is.

627
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:08,703
Bullshit. This is a bunch
of crap, Rob.

628
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,641
Let's go.

629
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,348
Of course, if you choose to
leave now,

630
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:22,057
you will not receive payment
of any kind

631
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,783
as the terms of your contract
make clear.

632
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:29,596
There are conditions.

633
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:32,732
All of you will have to remain.

634
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,767
And in a study this sensitive,

635
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,276
You're fucking kidding me.

636
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:45,378
You guys are actually
considering this.

637
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:47,082
I'll do it.
- Rob!

638
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,751
Lee and I are in.
- Me too.

639
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:53,222
Fine. Y'know what?

640
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:55,220
I'm done playing guinea pig.

641
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,388
I don't think so.

642
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:59,194
Greg!

643
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:01,730
The doctors are here.
- I don't care.

644
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:20,684
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

645
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,276
Get off me.

646
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,884
Get your ass in there.

647
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:25,644
What the fuck? This is bullshit!

648
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:27,514
Now I'm just stuck in here?

649
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:29,589
What the hell is wrong with
you man?

650
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:31,623
Don't you see how dangerous
this is?

651
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,660
You have no idea what this
feels like, Greg.

652
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:43,466
I don't know.

653
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:51,177
Thanks, Rob.

654
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:55,547
Oh, and, she thinks it would
be a good idea

655
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:01,486
I'll do it.

656
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:28,014
(Computer beeping)

657
00:51:35,992 --> 00:51:37,857
(Sighs)

658
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:45,664
New message.

659
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:47,563
We're running on a time line.

660
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,669
Haven't heard from you.

661
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:51,999
And I don't like the sound
of it.

662
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:53,732
Call me.

663
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:14,394
Any bran left?

664
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:16,999
(Chuckling)

665
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:19,868
You gonna eat that?

666
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:21,400
No.

667
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:43,585
Hey guys. Look what I can do.

668
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:47,761
(Chuckling)

669
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:51,900
Oh my gosh!

670
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:54,103
Did that hurt?
- A little.

671
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,134
I bet Benal could top that.
- Top what?

672
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:58,237
What are you doing?

673
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:01,273
You do it, ya God damn pussy.

674
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:04,213
Whoa! Whoa!

675
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:06,980
May I have that, please?

676
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:16,957
Nigel's little incident
notwithstanding,

677
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,059
we're still a long way of
predicting

678
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:21,126
how effectively your bodies
can regenerate.

679
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:27,202
It's time for your next dose.

680
00:53:27,437 --> 00:53:28,961
What wants to go first?

681
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,730
(Yelling)

682
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,417
(Music)

683
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:04,272
(Music)

684
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:24,024
(Music)

685
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:43,977
(Music)

686
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:46,511
What are you doing?

687
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,047
God!

688
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:51,217
I've got nothing to say to you.

689
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:19,078
What are you doing here?

690
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:29,756
(Music)

691
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:41,935
(Yelling)

692
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:49,275
It's just sex.

693
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:52,581
Everybody does it.

694
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:57,113
You're right.

695
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:06,292
(Growling)

696
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:10,827
What the hell?

697
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:12,728
I'm not into that.
- Shut up!

698
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:15,237
What the fuck is wrong -

699
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:18,137
(Yelling)

700
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:20,703
What the fuck!

701
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:23,643
(Yelling and growling)

702
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,507
Get off of me.

703
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:35,957
Get the fuck outta here.

704
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:44,998
We're at a critical point.

705
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:53,339
Yes. I understand.

706
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:04,452
(Music)

707
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:23,034
It's not in the protocols.

708
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,968
Protocols have changed.

709
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:28,541
(Machine beeping)

710
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:49,531
This may sting a little.

711
00:58:02,078 --> 00:58:04,012
5.5 seconds.

712
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:06,876
Again.

713
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,689
3 seconds.

714
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:20,524
Again.

715
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:24,759
1 second.

716
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:28,131
That's enough.

717
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,037
(Sigh)

718
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:56,963
Do you trust me?

719
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:07,238
Dr. Wilcox.

720
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:11,772
Dr. Wilcox, what are you doing?

721
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:13,812
Aaron get the suture!

722
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,915
(Beeping speeds up)

723
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:17,982
Stop! Stop.

724
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:24,318
What are you doing? You're
killing him!

725
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,324
Gimme another dose.

726
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,996
Do it!

727
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,205
(Beeping flatlines)

728
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:47,847
(Beeping stabilizes)

729
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,539
(Music)

730
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:20,913
I was wondering when you'd
wake up.

731
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:30,692
You should be very proud of
yourself.

732
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:40,665
You've secured the future of
this project.

733
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:48,066
Rob?

734
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:50,679
Is everything okay?

735
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:03,748
STOP!

736
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:07,195
Rob! Stop!

737
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:09,291
Help!

738
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:11,396
Help me!

739
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:19,439
(Yelling and groaning)

740
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:21,504
Help!

741
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:35,556
Rob.

742
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:42,462
Help!

743
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:44,432
STOP!

744
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:47,268
(Groaning)

745
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:51,338
(Groaning continues)

746
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:00,313
(Thunder rolls)

747
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,484
Y'know I believe in this,
doctor.

748
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,914
But without more security,
it's just not safe.

749
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:06,815
I know some guys that need work.

750
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,751
I could make a couple phone
calls.

751
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:10,322
No.

752
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,993
Dr. Wilcox, please.

753
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,661
We can't.

754
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,659
This experiment is sensitive.

755
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,729
If any of this became public-

756
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,865
Then I'm sorry. I quit.

757
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:21,967
This is not worth it.

758
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:25,171
You tell Ravexin to kiss my ass.

759
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:33,005
Technically, this isn't just
a Ravexin study.

760
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:35,046
It's more of a partnership.

761
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:37,350
And our employers are very...

762
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,248
...eager now, to see it
through.

763
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:41,824
How much is she paying you?

764
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:43,855
Same as I'm willing to pay you.

765
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:46,889
All of you.

766
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:57,570
Consider that an early bonus.

767
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:02,644
But I need you to finish this
with me.

768
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:13,719
Patty, please.

769
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,719
if not for the money,

770
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,755
then do it for science.

771
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:22,496
With all due respect,
Dr. Wilcox...

772
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:24,999
Fuck science.

773
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:28,100
I need a new car.

774
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:35,942
(Music)

775
01:03:52,895 --> 01:03:54,487
Hey Rob.

776
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:58,431
I have something for you.

777
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:01,426
It's gonna help you relax.

778
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,536
You can do whatever you want
to me.

779
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:05,501
It doesn't matter.

780
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:09,137
Nothing you can do tome
matters.

781
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:18,382
You'll never know what it
feels like.

782
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:01,820
Why would I lie to you?

783
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:03,497
I dunno. Why would you lie
tome?

784
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,166
I wouldn't.

785
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,028
So Taylor didn't tell you?

786
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:09,434
Well, I hope it's not gone.

787
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:14,809
You've gotta be shittin' me.

788
01:05:15,044 --> 01:05:16,511
Right here?

789
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,338
In the facility?
- That's right.

790
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,173
Taylor took it from me when
I checked in.

791
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:32,695
C'mon dawg. What do you have

792
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:34,060
C'mon.

793
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:50,239
I'm telling ya. It's up here.

794
01:05:53,249 --> 01:05:55,183
(inaudible)

795
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:58,376
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

796
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,282
What'd I tell you, dawg?

797
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:02,319
There ya go.

798
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:06,417
That's right. Liquor's liquor.

799
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,265
Oh yeah. Feel the burn.

800
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:15,499
Feel the burn.

801
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:21,437
Alright. Cool.

802
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:27,379
Yeah.

803
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:29,277
That's good.
- Yeah.

804
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:32,418
Oh shit. Did you hear something?

805
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:33,917
What?

806
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:35,646
Put that away.

807
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,323
Oh man -

808
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:41,587
Oww Jesus. What the fuck!
- Oh shit.

809
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,458
Ahh!

810
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:50,629
Oh fuck.

811
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:56,744
(Machine beeping)

812
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:05,317
I need everyone to listen to me.

813
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:07,453
Greg is trying to escape.

814
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:21,365
I'll give you more RXZ-19.

815
01:07:26,642 --> 01:07:28,075
(Music)

816
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:36,348
Greg! C'mere!

817
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,935
Hey! Stop!

818
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:00,165
Hey!

819
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:13,378
Hey!

820
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:16,522
Right here. Hey! Hey!

821
01:08:17,059 --> 01:08:18,993
(Groaning)

822
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:21,629
Stay down!

823
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:27,135
(Hard rock music)

824
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:33,675
(Screaming)

825
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:35,706
(Groaning)

826
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:42,350
(Screaming)

827
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:48,755
(Yelling and groaning)

828
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,925
I said that's enough!

829
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,828
(Screaming)

830
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,135
(Groaning)

831
01:09:11,747 --> 01:09:13,578
(Yelling and gunshot)

832
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:16,614
(More gunshots)

833
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:23,357
Jesus Christ, Benal!

834
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:25,719
You fuckin' shot me!
- My bad.

835
01:09:25,961 --> 01:09:27,428
You asshole.

836
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:29,426
You fuckin' asshole. I'm
gonna kill you!

837
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:31,292
Everybody, wait!

838
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:39,372
(Laughing)

839
01:09:41,977 --> 01:09:43,911
Is everyone else okay?

840
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:47,511
I'm... I'm okay...

841
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:49,979
Look. I'm...

842
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:53,382
I'm okay. I'm okay.

843
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:56,215
Look.

844
01:09:59,995 --> 01:10:01,929
Lay down.

845
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:05,933
Lay down.

846
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:10,635
What the hell? She was shot?

847
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:12,568
He shot her.

848
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:15,109
(Machine beeping)

849
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,645
Keep the subject outside.

850
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:21,645
No one gets in here. Understand?
- Yeah.

851
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:28,654
What's going on?

852
01:10:37,866 --> 01:10:39,800
No exit wounds. What?!

853
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:43,995
The bullets,
they're lodged inside her.

854
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,071
We're gonna have to extract
them.

855
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:48,666
Her vitals are crashing.

856
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:50,708
(Beeping speeds up)

857
01:10:54,483 --> 01:10:56,348
Here. Right here.

858
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:11,529
I can't get inside.

859
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:13,234
We're losing her.

860
01:11:13,502 --> 01:11:15,163
I can't get inside!

861
01:11:15,704 --> 01:11:17,729
Do something!
- I can't get inside!

862
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:20,072
(Beeping flatlines)

863
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:22,477
FUCK!

864
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:24,577
Jesus.

865
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:28,482
Oh God.

866
01:11:36,725 --> 01:11:38,090
(Music)

867
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:51,069
We were unable...

868
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:06,414
Stacy...

869
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,418
I knew you two were close.

870
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:10,891
If there's anything you need,
just ask.

871
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:14,555
There is... one thing.

872
01:12:14,797 --> 01:12:16,594
Of course. Anything.

873
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:18,356
You could...

874
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:20,632
...give us our dose now.

875
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:23,435
Like you promised.

876
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,805
What?

877
01:12:26,775 --> 01:12:28,640
RXZ-19.

878
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:31,279
For finding Greg.

879
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:32,946
Remember?

880
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:35,343
The girl's right. A deal's
a deal.

881
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:37,848
A deal's a deal.

882
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:40,618
You promised.
- We want it right now.

883
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:42,551
Okay! OKAY!

884
01:12:42,825 --> 01:12:44,656
I'll give it to you. Yes.
Of course.

885
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:46,959
Yes. It's coming.

886
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,959
I'll just have Aaron...

887
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,961
...prepare it now.

888
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:54,700
Wait in the lounge, and...

889
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:56,767
We'll call you when it's ready.

890
01:12:57,473 --> 01:12:58,963
Okay?

891
01:12:59,775 --> 01:13:01,242
Okay.

892
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:04,138
Thanks.

893
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,870
It's coming.

894
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:10,948
Jolly good, jolly good,
jolly good...

895
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:23,661
I want the entire facility
locked down.

896
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,389
No one leaves.

897
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:32,670
Get the detox solution.

898
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:34,375
All of it.

899
01:13:41,016 --> 01:13:43,211
No, Greg. Experiment's over.

900
01:13:47,022 --> 01:13:48,455
(Music)

901
01:13:58,867 --> 01:14:00,801
(Thunder rolls and claps)

902
01:14:08,043 --> 01:14:09,340
(Music)

903
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:21,553
Are we ready?

904
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:29,997
Who do you want first?

905
01:14:35,204 --> 01:14:37,069
My turn! My turn!
- Real soon.

906
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:59,090
Patty, run the IV wide open.

907
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,193
I'm doubling the concentration.

908
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:03,723
We can't waste any time.

909
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:05,763
(Thunder rolls)

910
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:33,423
(Thunder rolls and claps)

911
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:41,125
Oh no.

912
01:15:41,803 --> 01:15:43,634
Probably the storm overloaded
the circuit,

913
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:45,567
tripped the breaker.

914
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:47,604
Curtis, breaker's down.

915
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:49,435
Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.

916
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:56,143
(Thunder rolling)

917
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:14,602
(Groaning)

918
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:20,167
See, I told you. Nothing to
worry about.

919
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:26,681
(Thunderclaps)

920
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,382
Come on!

921
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:30,849
Hey!

922
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,385
Some one let me out!

923
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:40,628
(Thunderclaps)

924
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:53,007
(Beating on door)

925
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:00,648
This is gonna hurt.

926
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:07,386
Okay.

927
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:12,924
(Groaning)

928
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:16,228
(Yelling)

929
01:17:19,067 --> 01:17:21,001
(Screaming)

930

933
01:17:42,124 --> 01:17:44,058
Is the detox working?

934
01:17:44,426 --> 01:17:46,360
It's too early to tell.

935
01:17:47,596 --> 01:17:49,587
Get the next subject ready.

936
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:51,628
We don't have much time.

01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,481
Honey, what's wrong?

940
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,877
The others... they attacked me.

941
01:18:47,622 --> 01:18:49,317
Honey, are you okay? C'mon.

942
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:51,389
I tried to stop them, but...

943
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:53,491
What'd you say, honey?

949
01:19:33,735 --> 01:19:35,498
Where is it?

950
01:19:35,737 --> 01:19:37,534
WHERE THE FUCK IS IT?

952
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:11,836
Anymore?

953
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,214
Anymore, doctor?

954
01:20:21,082 --> 01:20:22,777
Anymore?

955
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:25,851
Doctor.

956
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:31,425
Doctor...

957
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:33,685

Did you get my transmission?

977
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:14,124
I repeat, did you get my last
transmission?

978
01:22:14,696 --> 01:22:16,857
That's affirmative.
What's your status?

979
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:29,041
Over and out.

980
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:30,904
Who are you working for, Aaron?

981
01:22:31,179 --> 01:22:32,942
Who do you think paid for
RXZ-19?

982
01:22:34,349 --> 01:22:36,283
They're gonna bury it.

983
01:22:36,518 --> 01:22:38,008
All of it.

984
01:22:38,253 --> 01:22:40,016
What's gonna happen to Rob,
Aaron?

985
01:22:43,258 --> 01:22:45,192

Answer me, Aaron!

989
01:22:55,937 --> 01:22:57,461
ANSWER ME!
- Okay.

990
01:22:57,739 --> 01:22:59,366
They're gonna cover it up.

991
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:04,201
Okay? Don't be so fuckin' naive.

992
01:23:04,746 --> 01:23:06,111
Jesus.

993
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:10,280
Turn around.

994
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:12,042
TURN AROUND!

995
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:14,485
Whatever you're thinking, don't.

996
01:23:14,756 --> 01:23:16,451
Okay? These are not good people.

997
01:23:16,725 --> 01:23:18,352
They don't fuck around.
- DO IT!

998
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,603
If you're not back by-

999
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:35,673
Give me the keys, Aaron.

Okay.

1004
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:20,754
Okay. Hold on.

1005
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:22,650
Nothing you can do...

1006
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:24,722
There's gotta be some left.

1007
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:30,464
(Groaning)

1008
01:24:30,698 --> 01:24:32,495
They... used it all.

1009
01:24:44,045 --> 01:24:45,979
Maybe I deserve this.

1010
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:51,011
I didn't want it to come
to this.

1011
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,654
(Gasping)

1012
01:25:02,363 --> 01:25:04,627

1018
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:54,108
Is everyone still inside the
building?

1019
01:25:54,382 --> 01:25:56,247
Yes sir. As far as I know.

1020
01:25:56,484 --> 01:25:58,281
Has any outside contact
been made?

1021
01:25:58,553 --> 01:26:00,384
No sir. I'm certain of it.

1022
01:26:02,257 --> 01:26:04,191
What's your name?

1023
01:26:05,226 --> 01:26:07,490
It's... Aaron, sir.
