myself.

00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:17,861
Well, someone needs to say
to them, you know what,

00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:18,966

and now you're broke?

He's an assistant for Christ

- Yeah, well there's an idea.

39
00:03:56,926 --> 00:03:58,479
I bet Frankie wouldn't
mind slaving around all day

learn and see,

of.

mold for after dinner.

do that where you're from?

eat jello mold either.

without hormone-free chicken.

please?

will you shut up about it?

in a sec.

disobedience.

even know what's wrong with me.

expensive.

I had to urinate.

137

In searching for a pot,
I found several.

138
00:09:22,423 --> 00:09:25,806
Some were old, with a
chord or a lever.

139

Others were new,
with buttons, a bidet.

The seats, they were
covered in cellophane.

So that if I got on
with it, I'd wet myself.

Rather than settling for
the disappointment of one,

00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:43,583
I tested them all.

And as I was toweling
myself off afterwards,

The bank is cutting costs,
I'm sure you're aware.

00:11:03,593 --> 00:11:04,560
we were gonna look
at a goddamn seal,

179
00:11:04,594 --> 00:11:05,803
not move across country.

180
00:11:05,837 --> 00:11:07,252
- [Frankie] The doctor said
change would be good for me,

181
00:11:07,287 --> 00:11:08,288
so I think we should go.

182
00:11:08,322 --> 00:11:09,116
- [Patrick] I can't
leave the city,

183
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:10,117
I'll be a fish out of water.

184
00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:11,809
That's it, I'm going
back to the apartment.

185
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:12,913
- [Sutton] Okay, wait a minute.

186
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:13,776
Jesus!

187
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:15,536
- It's a stupid idea.
- Maybe.

188
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:17,469
- An irresponsible idea.
- You wanted him

189
00:11:17,504 --> 00:11:18,470
to be more independent.

190
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:19,299
- [Patrick] He doesn't
have the wherewithal

191
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,541
to make decisions like that.

192
00:11:20,576 --> 00:11:22,267
He's too young, he didn't go
to college for Christ sake.

193
00:11:22,302 --> 00:11:23,303
He doesn't know
what's best for him.

194
00:11:23,337 --> 00:11:24,131
- [Sutton] Oh, but you do?

195
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:24,960
- [Patrick] More than him.

196
00:11:24,994 --> 00:11:25,995
- [Sutton] Well it's his life.

197
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,996
- [Patrick] Our lives,
it's our lives, Sutton.

198
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:28,239
The decision affects us all.

199
00:11:28,273 --> 00:11:31,207
- [Sutton] Maybe, but it might
be a good idea to expand.

200
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:32,243
- [Patrick] No, I hate
expanding.

201
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:33,416
People leave the city when they

202
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:34,935
don't know what they want
or they fuck up and quit.

203
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,799
- [Sutton] Or because they're
looking for something more.

204
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:39,353
Look, I am hesitant on the idea
too, okay?

205
00:11:39,388 --> 00:11:40,769
- [Patrick] It's not
good for us.

206
00:11:40,803 --> 00:11:41,735
- [Sutton] Well it might
be good for him.

207
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,461
And if it's good for him,
then it's good--

208
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,773
- [Patrick] He doesn't
own the apartment,

209
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:46,360
we should be making
the decision ourselves,

210
00:11:46,395 --> 00:11:47,396
we have all the money!

211
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,259
- [Sutton] Well, then
maybe we should let him

212
00:11:48,293 --> 00:11:49,605
buy into the apartment or
something

213
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,813
so that it's a little
bit more fair.

214
00:11:50,848 --> 00:11:51,711
- [Patrick] What?

215
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:52,712
[groans] How?

216
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,334
- [Sutton] I don't know,
but it makes sense,

217
00:11:54,368 --> 00:11:55,680
from his point of view.

218
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,026
- [Patrick] I'm not doing
it, you talk to him.

219
00:11:57,061 --> 00:11:59,132
- [Sutton] Oh, Christ.

220
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:02,238
Let's just, he'll cool off.

221
00:12:02,273 --> 00:12:03,481
- [Frankie] I don't understand,

222
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,240
are we supposed to just stay
here the rest of our lives,

223
00:12:04,275 --> 00:12:05,172
'cause that's what he wants?

224
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:06,173
I mean is that what you want?

225
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,381
- [Sutton] Look, I hear
what you're saying--

226
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,210
- [Frankie] And haven't
you wanted to go west?

227
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:09,245
- [Sutton] Yes, I do.

228
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,557
- [Frankie] I get that
you're smarter than me,

229
00:12:10,591 --> 00:12:11,834
you're both smarter
than me, I get it.

230
00:12:11,869 --> 00:12:12,801
- [Sutton] You are smart.

231
00:12:12,835 --> 00:12:13,836
- [Frankie] But I need
to be listened to

232
00:12:13,871 --> 00:12:14,975
if we're going to stay together.

233
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,045
I need to have a
say in what we do.

234
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,322
- And I'm not a fucking peasant.
- Right.

235
00:12:17,357 --> 00:12:19,497
If he's not gonna
listen to my ideas,

236
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:20,601
if he's not gonna
listen to my ideas,

237
00:12:20,636 --> 00:12:22,258
I'm not gonna support him,
or listen to his advice.

238
00:12:22,293 --> 00:12:24,260
- [Woman] Two bedroom,
two bath, newly renovated,

239
00:12:24,295 --> 00:12:25,537
three blocks from the Pacific.

240
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:27,160
Owners are French,
they're looking to unload.

241
00:12:27,194 --> 00:12:28,782
It's a goddamn steal, what
they're asking.

242
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:30,094
- Let me talk it
over with Patrick.

243
00:12:30,128 --> 00:12:32,441
- [Woman] What the fuck
is there to talk about?

244
00:12:32,475 --> 00:12:35,099
- [laughs] Jesus, okay,
how much time do I have?

245
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:37,135
- Look, I've been taking
everything into account,

246
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,619
and I think we should
consolidate our debt.

247
00:12:38,654 --> 00:12:40,932
- Oh no no no no no, I
am not consolidating.

248
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:43,832
You and Frankie have so
much more debt than I do!

249
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:46,041
- Well I mean, are we in
this together, or not?

250
00:12:46,075 --> 00:12:47,145
- Yes, yeah,

251
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,458
but some things are just
better left kept separate.

252
00:12:49,492 --> 00:12:50,804
- Oh I see, so if it's
something I want,

253
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,219
we should keep everything
separate.

254
00:12:52,254 --> 00:12:53,048
- Oh my God.
- If it's something

255
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:53,876
you and Frankie want,

256
00:12:53,911 --> 00:12:55,498
suddenly it's majority ruled.

257
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:56,845
I think we should
consolidate our debt

258
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,398
and then agree not
to take on any more.

259
00:12:58,432 --> 00:12:59,399
That's what I think.
- I'm not in the mood okay?

260
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:00,296
So not today.

261
00:13:00,331 --> 00:13:01,781
- [Patrick] What's the
matter with you?

262
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,886
- [Frankie] The doctor
increased my medication.

263
00:13:03,921 --> 00:13:05,129
- [Sutton] What?

264
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:07,338
- [Frankie] My stomach hurts
and all I wanna do is sleep.

265
00:13:07,372 --> 00:13:08,995
- I think we need to take
him to see Dr. Reingold.

266
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:10,065
Don't you think we
should do that?

267
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:11,929
- I bought us a condo
in Santa Monica.

268
00:13:11,963 --> 00:13:12,861
- Wait, really?
- Yeah.

269
00:13:12,895 --> 00:13:14,000
I've been doing some research,

270
00:13:14,034 --> 00:13:15,173
and there's a holistic doctor
out there

271
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:18,038
that I think would be
really good for Frankie.

272
00:13:18,073 --> 00:13:19,660
- You bought an apartment in
California, you didn't tell me?

273
00:13:19,695 --> 00:13:22,077
- Yeah, it's better that we
get there sooner than later.

274
00:13:22,111 --> 00:13:23,561
- I thought we all had
a say in what's best.

275
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,701
This isn't me overreacting
this time Sutton,

276
00:13:25,735 --> 00:13:26,633
you're on a rampage!

277
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:27,703
He's sick and you're using it

278
00:13:27,737 --> 00:13:29,567
as an excuse to go
on a goddamn rampage.

279
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:30,395
- I'm not on a rampage!

280
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,396
- Are you an escrow?

281
00:13:31,431 --> 00:13:32,018
- Hey Sutton can you
please call the doctor,

282
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:33,329
I really don't feel well.

283
00:13:35,642 --> 00:13:37,230
- [Woman] Dr. Davis,
telephone please.

284
00:13:37,264 --> 00:13:39,611
Dr. Davis, telephone please.

285
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:52,314
- Hey, I'm just going
to take a listen, okay?

286
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:53,177
- Okay.

287
00:13:53,211 --> 00:13:55,144
- You're fat now, a little.
[laughs]

288
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:56,525
- Please.

289
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,354
- Gay man fat, I see
you in your midsection.

290
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:00,874
- You're just fuckin' with me.

291
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:02,427
- So serious.

292
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,396
- Alex you think that
doctor in California

293
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,260
is really gonna have the answer?

294
00:14:07,294 --> 00:14:08,088
- I dunno.

295
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:10,401
That is not the point.

296
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:14,992
You know, what you are
doing here with them,

297
00:14:15,026 --> 00:14:17,822
it may be the answer to why it
never works with two people.

298
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,720
But to work, Frankie must
be well.

299
00:14:19,755 --> 00:14:21,308
- You don't understand.

300
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:22,137
- No?

301
00:14:22,171 --> 00:14:23,759
Okay, I don't understand.

302
00:14:23,793 --> 00:14:26,451
I'm just a doctor who
works in prisons.

303
00:14:26,486 --> 00:14:29,006
Cough please, spread your
cheeks.

304
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,662
Is it cark, no?

305
00:14:30,697 --> 00:14:32,043
Okay, that is all.

306
00:14:32,975 --> 00:14:35,184
Who asked me to leave
work and come here?

307
00:14:35,219 --> 00:14:36,668
Sutton? Is he here?

308
00:14:36,703 --> 00:14:37,566
No.

309
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,948
Frankie? No, you did.

310
00:14:39,982 --> 00:14:42,122
You want to know what I think?

311
00:14:42,157 --> 00:14:45,850
I think you go,
and everyone wins.

312
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,577
Improvements and adventures.

313
00:14:48,611 --> 00:14:50,027
This is stagnation.

314
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,237
- [Patrick] How is Louise?

315
00:14:54,617 --> 00:14:56,550
- [Alex] We are still
getting over Carmine.

316
00:14:56,585 --> 00:14:58,069
- You think she'll
ever try again?

317
00:14:58,104 --> 00:14:59,312
- Menage a trois?

318
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,832
Who knows.

319
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:06,181
- You know at first with
Frankie, it was just sexual.

320
00:15:06,215 --> 00:15:07,458
Sutton and I aren't versatile,

321
00:15:07,492 --> 00:15:09,494
so it was nice to
have someone for that.

322
00:15:11,324 --> 00:15:12,497
But then after a while,

323
00:15:13,774 --> 00:15:17,226
you know when we knew
there was potential,

324
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,540
it's nice to be needed.

325
00:15:20,574 --> 00:15:22,128
- And what about to need?

326
00:15:24,371 --> 00:15:25,925
You need him, hm?

327
00:15:30,136 --> 00:15:30,964
Well.

328
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:34,588
[dramatic orchestral music]

329
00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:49,638
- [Patrick] Look, it was
dumb of me

330
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:50,673
not to let you have a say,

331
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:51,502
I get that now.

332
00:15:51,536 --> 00:15:52,537
- [Frankie] You can't resent
him?

333
00:15:52,572 --> 00:15:54,470
- [Sutton] I don't, you
and Sutton matter more.

334
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:57,404
Look there's one thing
I need from you though.

335
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,785
It's hypocritical of
him not to agree,

336
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:00,476
he's only thinking of himself.

337
00:16:01,822 --> 00:16:02,616
- [Frankie] What is it?

338
00:16:02,651 --> 00:16:03,583
- [Sutton] You manipulated him.

339
00:16:03,617 --> 00:16:05,585
- [Patrick] No, I asked,
it's a compromise.

340
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:06,689
The debt will go down faster

341
00:16:06,724 --> 00:16:07,759
if we're all paying it together.

342
00:16:07,794 --> 00:16:08,795
- [Sutton] That is not a
compromise,

343
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:10,831
no it's not a compromise,
we talked about...

344
00:16:10,866 --> 00:16:14,939
[slow dramatic orchestral music]

345
00:16:46,695 --> 00:16:48,283
- [Patrick] Frankie,
Sutton's making juice.

346
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:49,146
You want one?

347
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,391
- [Sutton] Does he want one?

348
00:17:00,088 --> 00:17:03,401
[slow orchestral music]

349
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:29,634
- [Patrick] They gotta
have some nuts or something

350
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:31,119
at least that isn't processed.

351
00:17:31,153 --> 00:17:32,085
- [Frankie] I think there's
a bathroom around the back.

352
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,880
- Don't touch anything.
- I won't.

353
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,538
- Uh, there's no treadmill,
by the way.

354
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:37,504
- Well, get used to it.

355
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:39,092
That's what we're
in for out here.

356
00:17:39,127 --> 00:17:40,956
Look, I know I didn't
get very far today,

357
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,233
but I want you to
see all the sights.

358
00:17:42,268 --> 00:17:43,303
You feel up for that, right?

359
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:44,132
- Yeah.

360
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,271
- 'Cause I'm torn.

361
00:17:45,305 --> 00:17:47,411
We got to get you to
California for the doctor lady.

362
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:48,722
Look I know we
should have flown,

363
00:17:48,757 --> 00:17:51,139
but it's good to have new
experiences.

364
00:17:51,173 --> 00:17:52,001
- Yeah, right.

365
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:53,693
Oh, I'm starving.

366
00:17:53,727 --> 00:17:55,867
There's gotta be a diner
around here or something.

367
00:17:55,902 --> 00:17:57,835
Maybe get some eggs.

368
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:00,217
Huh Sutton, eggs?

369
00:18:00,251 --> 00:18:01,080
Sutton!

370
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:03,944
Eggs!

371
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:08,466
Guess you're not
coming with us, huh?

372
00:18:08,501 --> 00:18:09,329
Are you ready?

373
00:18:14,265 --> 00:18:15,646
- [Frankie] I want a soda,
do you guys want anything?

374
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,337
- [Sutton] Yeah, nothing diet.

375
00:18:17,372 --> 00:18:19,028
- Patrick?
- I'm fine.

376
00:18:20,444 --> 00:18:21,445
- [Sutton] What?

377
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:22,446
- [Patrick] You brought
a lot of drugs with you.

378
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,930
- [Sutton] Yeah, well,
road trip, you know?

379
00:18:23,964 --> 00:18:26,760
You know I was thinking that
maybe I'd let Frankie try some.

380
00:18:26,795 --> 00:18:28,107
He was talking to me
about the molly the other,

381
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,867
and I don't know, I think
maybe he might like it.

382
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:30,695
- [Patrick] Uh huh.

383
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,489
- [Sutton] What is
wrong with you?

384
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:32,663
You're acting funny.

385
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:33,422
- [Patrick] I'm a little
creeped out by all the drugs,

386
00:18:33,457 --> 00:18:34,251
is all.

387
00:18:34,285 --> 00:18:35,424
- [Sutton] What do you mean?

388
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:36,287
- [Patrick] Well, you know
I've never approved of it.

389
00:18:36,322 --> 00:18:37,771
- [Sutton] Yeah,
I know, for you.

390
00:18:37,806 --> 00:18:40,119
- [Patrick] No, not just
for me, not just for me.

391
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:42,155
I never thought it was a
particularly ingenious idea,

392
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,812
but I was tolerating it,
I've been tolerating it.

393
00:18:43,846 --> 00:18:44,985
You know I've been
looking the other way,

394
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,159
for the sake of the
relationship.

395
00:18:46,194 --> 00:18:47,436
- [Sutton] Don't start, please.

396
00:18:47,471 --> 00:18:48,506
- [Patrick] You never would
have agreed to getting together

397
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,611
if I had said no to the drugs.

398
00:18:49,645 --> 00:18:50,474
- [Sutton] Yeah, I know.

399
00:18:50,508 --> 00:18:51,475
- [Patrick] I always
thought it was

400
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:53,201
some sort of youthful
phase sort of thing,

401
00:18:53,235 --> 00:18:55,203
a gross, bad, dumb, you know,

402
00:18:55,237 --> 00:18:56,549
that would eventually fade out.

403
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,999
And it wasn't worth throwing
the whole relationship away.

404
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:00,242
But now, what
you're saying to me,

405
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:01,485
you're telling me that instead
of fading out the drugs,

406
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:02,969
you want Frankie to do them too.

407
00:19:03,003 --> 00:19:04,108
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

408
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,282
So I don't think that's,
you know,

409
00:19:05,316 --> 00:19:07,007
a good idea to have two
crack addicts running around.

410
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:08,561
Not to mention the fact
that the whole reason

411
00:19:08,595 --> 00:19:10,149
we're headed west is
to make Frankie well!

412
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:11,633
- [Sutton] Oh this is
completely unreasonable.

413
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:13,566
I mean you've seen me, you've
known that I smoke pot.

414
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,636
This wasn't a surprise.

415
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,948
And to the extent
that you don't approve?

416
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:18,467
I mean you've always been
perfectly happy

417
00:19:18,502 --> 00:19:20,193
to look the other way in
order to get what you want.

418
00:19:20,228 --> 00:19:22,022
So now you're telling me
that you have a problem,

419
00:19:22,057 --> 00:19:23,886
I think you're trying to slam
me to get the upper hand.

420
00:19:23,921 --> 00:19:24,887
- [Patrick] No.

421
00:19:24,922 --> 00:19:25,750
- [Sutton] And you tried
drugs early on too,

422
00:19:25,785 --> 00:19:26,889
so don't act so innocent.
[laughs]

423
00:19:26,924 --> 00:19:27,718
- [Patrick] Hardly, I didn't
know what I was doing.

424
00:19:27,752 --> 00:19:28,857
I knew you would bring that up.

425
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:30,203
- [Sutton] And Frankie
wants to try something new,

426
00:19:30,238 --> 00:19:32,688
he's perfectly entitled to
make up his mind on his own.

427
00:19:32,723 --> 00:19:34,276
- [Patrick] We're not
expanding the drug use here,

428
00:19:34,311 --> 00:19:35,277
we're limiting it.

429
00:19:35,312 --> 00:19:36,589
[scoffs]

430
00:19:36,623 --> 00:19:38,487
- [Sutton] Wait, we're
not limiting my use, huh?

431
00:19:38,522 --> 00:19:39,523
Is that what you're saying?
- No.

432
00:19:39,557 --> 00:19:40,386
- [Sutton] Because that
would be the next thing,

433
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,283
to tell me what to do.

434
00:19:41,318 --> 00:19:42,422
- [Patrick] No, you do
what you want.

435
00:19:42,457 --> 00:19:44,286
Just so Frankie's not
inhaling a bunch of poison.

436
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:45,598
If he thinks that's a good idea,

437
00:19:45,632 --> 00:19:47,772
then he's too fucking asinine
to make decisions for himself.

438
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:48,601
Pretty soon you'll want
me to join in.

439
00:19:48,635 --> 00:19:49,636
- Controlling.

440
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:50,672
- [Patrick] And we'll
be one big crack family.

441
00:19:50,706 --> 00:19:51,914
No, I'm trying not to
live on a crack farm.

442
00:19:51,949 --> 00:19:52,915
- [Sutton] I don't do crack!

443
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,778
I don't inject anything!
- Cocaine, whatever,

444
00:19:53,813 --> 00:19:55,746
you know what I mean.

445
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,023
- [Sutton] Sick
people smoke pot.

446
00:19:57,057 --> 00:19:58,231
I mean cancer, Jesus.

447
00:19:58,266 --> 00:20:00,268
And I mean, if Frankie
joined in every now and then,

448
00:20:00,302 --> 00:20:02,028
maybe I would want to
do it a little bit less.

449
00:20:02,062 --> 00:20:03,478
- [Patrick] That's ridiculous,
where's the logic in that?

450
00:20:03,512 --> 00:20:04,927
- [Sutton] Well, we would
only do it together. [laughs]

451
00:20:04,962 --> 00:20:06,653
- [Patrick] Yeah, all the
fucking time!

452
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:09,415
You're not doing it,
don't get any ideas.

453
00:20:09,449 --> 00:20:11,348
- [Frankie] Is he mad
at me or something?

454
00:20:11,382 --> 00:20:13,764
- [Sutton] It's nothing,
it's fine, it's fine.

455
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:15,628
Let's just go see Jefferson.

456
00:20:15,662 --> 00:20:19,010
[slow orchestral music]

457
00:21:08,405 --> 00:21:10,096
- I'm worried he didn't
see where he's going.

458
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,304
- No he's fine, trust me.

459
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:12,581
I've known him a
lot longer than you.

460
00:21:12,616 --> 00:21:13,996
He'll never leave us.

461
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,414
I just think if you wanna
try something, you should.

462
00:21:17,448 --> 00:21:18,415
I mean, you agree with that,
right?

463
00:21:18,449 --> 00:21:19,692
- Right, yeah.

464
00:21:19,726 --> 00:21:22,108
- I mean I know that I like it
maybe a little bit too much,

465
00:21:22,142 --> 00:21:23,316
and there are bad
things about it,

466
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:24,766
but it's still my
right to do it.

467
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,594
I mean I've always
been this way,

468
00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:27,320
I'm not gonna change for him.

469
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:28,356
- No, yeah.

470
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:31,082
- So, do you think maybe
you'd want to try some?

471
00:21:31,117 --> 00:21:31,980
- Uh, I don't know.

472
00:21:32,014 --> 00:21:33,844
- Because the more
I think about it,

473
00:21:33,878 --> 00:21:35,432
the more I think
that you should.

474
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:37,710
I mean how else are you
gonna know if it's for you

475
00:21:37,744 --> 00:21:39,228
unless you try it? [laughs]

476
00:21:39,263 --> 00:21:40,471
- Uh, right, I guess.

477
00:21:40,506 --> 00:21:42,093
- So I think you should try it.

478
00:21:43,992 --> 00:21:46,132
Look, I have some
back at the motel.

479
00:21:47,582 --> 00:21:49,031
A shotgun, just to see.

480
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:51,171
[coughs]

481
00:21:52,863 --> 00:21:54,416
- It kinda hurt. [laughs]

482
00:21:54,451 --> 00:21:55,590
- I'm sorry. [laughs]

483
00:21:55,624 --> 00:21:57,695
- I don't think I got any.

484
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,524
- Well, you got a little.

485
00:21:58,558 --> 00:21:59,490
You can try it again.

486
00:22:02,493 --> 00:22:03,322
- Sorry.

487
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:14,540
[laughs]

488
00:22:14,574 --> 00:22:15,368
That was a good one.

489
00:22:15,403 --> 00:22:16,369
- Yeah, you got it.

490
00:22:16,404 --> 00:22:17,474
That time you got it.

491
00:22:19,303 --> 00:22:20,580
- Oh, no.

492
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,203
Jesus.

493
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,352
[both laugh]

494
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:39,944
Jesus, that's--

495
00:22:39,979 --> 00:22:40,773
- Yeah, it's pretty good.

496
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:42,430
- [Frankie] That's good, yeah.

497
00:22:42,464 --> 00:22:45,122
- And it's not bad for you,
really, so.

498
00:22:46,295 --> 00:22:49,368
- [Frankie] Well that's good.

499
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:50,507
- You'll see.

500
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:54,718
[indistinct talking and
laughing]

501
00:22:58,963 --> 00:23:01,759
Look, he promises that he'll
only smoke pot on the weekends.

502
00:23:01,794 --> 00:23:02,898
That's good, right?

503
00:23:02,933 --> 00:23:04,624
Compromise, it'll be fine.

504
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:08,559
[passionate moans and kissing]

505
00:23:14,565 --> 00:23:18,258
[dramatic orchestral music]

506
00:23:41,592 --> 00:23:45,285
[dramatic orchestral music]

507
00:23:57,746 --> 00:24:01,440
[dramatic orchestral music]

508
00:24:10,518 --> 00:24:11,450
- [Patrick] Christ.

509
00:24:13,969 --> 00:24:14,798
Frankie.

510
00:24:16,662 --> 00:24:17,490
Frankie?

511
00:24:24,048 --> 00:24:26,603
[sobbing]

512
00:24:26,637 --> 00:24:30,054
What I have to hold onto
isn't a very ordinary dream.

513
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:32,471
I was always knew
complications were inevitable.

514
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,508
You wouldn't know,
wrapped up in your haze,

515
00:24:35,543 --> 00:24:38,822
but the past few days
afforded me the time to think,

516
00:24:38,856 --> 00:24:39,685
you know?

517
00:24:41,134 --> 00:24:43,482
I'm sittin' there in the
ER with Frankie,

518
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:45,518
and the doctor's looking
at me like I'm an idiot

519
00:24:45,553 --> 00:24:47,831
for letting my boyfriend

what I know to be right

00:32:12,585 --> 00:32:13,862
and say that it's not true?

698
00:32:13,897 --> 00:32:16,520
- We're making money,
baby, so much money.

699
00:32:16,555 --> 00:32:17,659
That's why I need a good PR,

700
00:32:17,694 --> 00:32:19,765
and you get your liberal
lips to pipe people down,

701
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,284
and you talk to your relatives.

702
00:32:21,318 --> 00:32:22,285
I don't want none of that

703
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:23,942
anti-trust horseshit from the
government.

704
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:24,770
- What do we get?

705
00:32:24,804 --> 00:32:25,598
- Money.

706
00:32:25,633 --> 00:32:26,427
So what do you say?

707
00:32:26,461 --> 00:32:27,635
- How long do we
have to stay here?

708
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:29,809
- We have to get Frankie to
a doctor's in California.

709
00:32:29,844 --> 00:32:30,879
- Well get him on a plane.

710
00:32:30,914 --> 00:32:31,950
- We can't.

711
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:32,847
- Why the hell not?
- He won't go without us.

712
00:32:32,881 --> 00:32:35,022
- [scoffs] Are you fucking
kidding me?

713
00:32:35,056 --> 00:32:36,023
Then you take him, huh?

714
00:32:36,057 --> 00:32:37,886
What the hell is wrong
with the two of you?

715
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:39,026
This is business.

716
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,888
- Look Edith--

717
00:32:39,923 --> 00:32:41,097
- Improve your own
goddamn lives,

718
00:32:41,131 --> 00:32:42,961
else you won't be
good to anybody.

719
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:44,100
Oh, I'm sorry,

720
00:32:44,134 --> 00:32:46,309
am I gonna have to fist you
in your fuckin' vaginas?

721
00:32:46,343 --> 00:32:47,551
Take the goddamn money.

722
00:32:47,586 --> 00:32:49,795
- We're gonna stay
here a few weeks.

723
00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:50,692
- Wait, what for?

724
00:32:50,727 --> 00:32:53,730
- Just a few weeks,
it'll be fine.

725
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:54,593
Need the money.

726
00:32:55,732 --> 00:32:56,664
- I didn't know.

- What's another word
for restitution?

731
00:33:38,085 --> 00:33:39,569
I don't want to use surrender.

732
00:33:42,951 --> 00:33:43,780
Sutton?

733
00:33:45,161 --> 00:33:46,024
- What's that?

734
00:33:57,173 --> 00:33:58,070
- [Frankie] Edith says
stocks will

735
00:33:58,105 --> 00:33:59,071
be up by the end of the quarter.

736
00:33:59,106 --> 00:34:00,900
Do you think we
should diversify more?

737
00:34:00,935 --> 00:34:01,763
- [Sutton] I mean it's
been a while

738
00:34:01,798 --> 00:34:02,868
and we are doing really well.

739
00:34:02,902 --> 00:34:04,180
I just don't think that we
should mess with things.

740
00:34:04,214 --> 00:34:05,077
- [Patrick] Right.

741
00:34:05,112 --> 00:34:05,905

in Santa Barbara that you
wanted?

743
00:34:06,872 --> 00:34:07,700
- [Sutton] Wednesday.

744
00:34:07,735 --> 00:34:08,667
I think that it's not
ridiculous.

745
00:34:08,701 --> 00:34:09,771
- [Patrick] It's a goddamn
vogue castle,

746
00:34:09,806 --> 00:34:11,325
not at all classy like
the ranch in Palm Springs.

747
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,775
- Oh we will be exhausted just
traveling between the two.

748
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,053
- [Patrick] I know.

749
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:16,606
- By the way those new credit
cards came in the other day.

750
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,434
- [Patrick] Oh great,
where did you leave them?

751
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,366
I wanna buy some things.

752
00:34:18,401 --> 00:34:19,298

754
00:34:30,447 --> 00:34:31,448
- [Patrick] What for?

755
00:34:31,483 --> 00:34:32,587
- Insider trading.

756
00:34:32,622 --> 00:34:34,210
Securities and wire fraud.

757
00:34:34,244 --> 00:34:36,384
Making false statements to a
grand jury.

758
00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:37,420
- [Patrick] Are we
gonna lose a lot?

759
00:34:37,454 --> 00:34:38,904
- I need to get out of
here for a little bit.

00:34:38,938 --> 00:34:39,732
- What are you talking about?

761
00:34:39,767 --> 00:34:41,009
You can't leave now.

762
00:34:41,044 --> 00:34:42,356
- Things will get better for
us if we take some time apart,

763
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:43,219
I think.

764
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:44,116
- I'm not doing that, leaving
him!

765
00:34:44,151 --> 00:34:45,393
Look.

766
00:34:45,428 --> 00:34:47,775
We lost most of our money, and

except for the apartment in
Santa Monica.

768

in California by now.

We're still in this
fucking shit hole.

what you're doing.

I don't think it's good money,

I don't think you're
helping anybody.

You're not mopping
floors or faxing shit,

00:35:15,285 --> 00:35:16,355
and as soon as the doctors
give me the go ahead,

00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:19,013
I'm going straight to
California,

778
00:35:19,047 --> 00:35:21,326
and I'm never setting foot
in another fucking hospital.

Why are we spending
all this money on shit,

he can't drink.

have a glass of something.

- Right down the hall.

- No way.
- Oh wow.

- Hi Gutrune, this is my
partner Patrick,

798
00:40:59,284 --> 00:41:00,492
and my other partner Frankie.

799
00:41:00,527 --> 00:41:01,907
- Hi, hi.
- Nice to meet you.

800
00:41:01,942 --> 00:41:03,357
- [Sutton] So you
guys headed out?

801
00:41:03,391 --> 00:41:04,841
- We're headed out,
ya, we have work.

802
00:41:04,876 --> 00:41:06,740
- Oh no.
- Work, on a Friday night.

803
00:41:06,774 --> 00:41:09,363
- Well, party, work.

804
00:41:09,397 --> 00:41:10,571
- Sure.
- Oh.

805
00:41:10,606 --> 00:41:12,124
What do you guys do, are you
involved in the nightlife?

806
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:14,817
- We are in real estate
lately, I guess you would say.

807
00:41:16,439 --> 00:41:19,407
Und then after we are
going for dinner somewhere,

808
00:41:19,442 --> 00:41:20,305
I'm sure.

809
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:21,651
- Well would you
like to just join us?

810
00:41:21,686 --> 00:41:22,790
- Yeah no, we've got
tons of food.

811

- Oh no, no, not tonight.

812
00:41:25,655 --> 00:41:30,660
But perhaps you would like to
join us sometime in our place?

Maybe Sunday, perhaps?

814
00:41:33,663 --> 00:41:34,492
- Do we have--

815
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:35,872
- No no no, that would be great.

816
00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:37,322
- For food und poker!

817
00:41:37,356 --> 00:41:38,806
- Poker?
- Ya.

818
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:40,049
- German poker.

und they might join.

00:41:47,884 --> 00:41:49,265
- Yeah, sure, well why not?

824
00:41:50,749 --> 00:41:51,578
- I kind of like them.

825
00:41:51,612 --> 00:41:52,440
- Yeah, right.

00:41:52,475 --> 00:41:53,407
- Frankie?

827
00:41:53,441 --> 00:41:54,235
- No, I thought they
were really cool.

828
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:55,443
- A little much.

829
00:41:55,478 --> 00:41:57,031
- No, they're just lesbians.

830
00:41:57,066 --> 00:41:58,550
I mean, German, it'd be nice.

831
00:41:58,585 --> 00:41:59,413
- Well I don't think
we should be

832
00:41:59,447 --> 00:42:00,621
socializing with the neighbors.

833
00:42:00,656 --> 00:42:01,519
- Why not?

834
00:42:01,553 --> 00:42:02,312
- I don't know, it never ends
well.

835
00:42:02,347 --> 00:42:03,590
We've got a lot going on here.

836
00:42:03,624 --> 00:42:05,246
Frankie has his college
applications.

837
00:42:05,281 --> 00:42:06,075
- They are killing me.

838
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:06,903
- They're killing him.

839
00:42:06,938 --> 00:42:08,836
- Oh, right, right right right.

840
00:42:08,871 --> 00:42:09,941
- The one, the more
assertive one,

841
00:42:09,975 --> 00:42:11,598
she looks like she shoves
the other one around.

842
00:42:11,632 --> 00:42:12,771
You noticed how she
never says anything?

843
00:42:12,806 --> 00:42:14,083
- Well sometimes a
relationship can be like that.

844
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:15,291
- Domestic violence or
something.

845
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:16,361
- Oh, please!

846
00:42:16,395 --> 00:42:17,535
- I don't know.

847
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:19,295
- You know, maybe we could
be a good influence here.

848
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:21,573
You know, show them how
good a threesome can be.

849
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:22,436
- Hey, yeah.

850
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,679
- Do we know any
single lesbians?

851
00:42:23,713 --> 00:42:25,197
- Just because a
threesome works for us

852
00:42:25,232 --> 00:42:27,579
doesn't mean it works so well
for some nutso German ladies.

853
00:42:27,614 --> 00:42:28,856
And the Russians down
the hall are coming?

854
00:42:28,891 --> 00:42:30,099
What is this, the UN.

855
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:31,721
- [laughs] No I think
Sutton actually has a point.

856
00:42:31,756 --> 00:42:34,344
I mean, we always said
we're trying new stuff,

857
00:42:34,379 --> 00:42:35,380
and it's really working now,

858
00:42:35,414 --> 00:42:37,140
so I think we could you know

859
00:42:37,175 --> 00:42:38,901
encourage other people to do the
same.

860
00:42:38,935 --> 00:42:42,145
'Cause it's working and we
can tell them about the perks.

861
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,146
- Why?

862
00:42:43,181 --> 00:42:46,529
- Because what we're
doing is the right idea.

863
00:42:47,634 --> 00:42:48,566
- [Frankie] What?

864
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,774
- I don't know, it's a little
arrogant.

865
00:42:49,808 --> 00:42:51,292
- What do you mean?
- It's working.

866
00:42:51,327 --> 00:42:53,225
- You know there's a difference
between a well-wisher,

867
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,020
being a well-wisher of the
threesome idea,

868
00:42:55,055 --> 00:42:56,366
if you know somebody asks,

869
00:42:56,401 --> 00:42:58,092
and going around looking
for couples to fuck with,

870
00:42:58,127 --> 00:42:59,093
trying to tell other people

871
00:42:59,128 --> 00:43:00,267
their business.
- That's not what he means.

873
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,450
- You have a really big grill.

874
00:43:11,485 --> 00:43:13,245
- In Germany, everything is big.

875
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,453
- In Russia too.

876
00:43:14,488 --> 00:43:16,317
- Well then we're gonna
have to go to Germany.

877
00:43:16,352 --> 00:43:17,456
- Ya, you should.

878
00:43:17,491 --> 00:43:19,320
- Patrick is very
fond of big things.

879
00:43:19,355 --> 00:43:20,736
- He's kidding, he's kidding.

880
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:22,047
- No, yeah, I'm kidding.

881
00:43:22,082 --> 00:43:23,842
They know I'm kidding.

882
00:43:23,877 --> 00:43:26,742
- So you're in, what is
it, open relationship?

883
00:43:26,776 --> 00:43:29,330
- Oh no, we don't.

884
00:43:29,365 --> 00:43:30,849
No, we're actually very happy.

885
00:43:30,884 --> 00:43:33,611
When it was just Patrick
and me we weren't, really.

886
00:43:33,645 --> 00:43:37,373
And then, you know, since
then, it's been really great.

887
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,271
I mean it's the first time for
any of us

888
00:43:39,306 --> 00:43:42,620
that a long term relationship
has worked, really.

889
00:43:42,654 --> 00:43:45,657
And I think it's more of a,
you know,

890
00:43:45,692 --> 00:43:47,625
higher state of being, you know?

891
00:43:48,487 --> 00:43:49,730
A more elevated state,
or at least,

892
00:43:49,765 --> 00:43:53,389
something that we should
all be striving for.

893
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:55,598
You know?

894
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,359
And we make all of
our decisions equally.

895
00:43:58,394 --> 00:43:59,188
- I see.

896
00:43:59,222 --> 00:44:00,465
- And that--
- Frankie.

897
00:44:00,499 --> 00:44:03,192
You want to help
Gutrune set the table?

898
00:44:03,226 --> 00:44:04,020
- Do you want to come help too?

899
00:44:04,055 --> 00:44:05,815
- I mean in a relationship,

900
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:08,093
it's usually just one
person calling the shots,

901
00:44:08,128 --> 00:44:09,819
or you know, wearing the pants,

902
00:44:09,854 --> 00:44:11,925
or whatever you want to
call it in your case.

903
00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:12,960
But in our case,

904
00:44:12,995 --> 00:44:15,894
we really make all of
the decisions together.

905
00:44:15,929 --> 00:44:18,345
- Gutrune prefers I
call the shots.

906
00:44:18,379 --> 00:44:19,795
- Oh, well.

907
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:21,624
At least you know that.
- Ya.

908
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,143
- You have it established.

909
00:44:23,177 --> 00:44:24,247
- I call the shots,

910
00:44:24,282 --> 00:44:26,698
but Olga and I like to
share everything equally.

911
00:44:26,733 --> 00:44:28,182
- Oh, wow.

912
00:44:29,011 --> 00:44:30,495
These are done, I mean,

913
00:44:30,529 --> 00:44:34,085
you have never had a
hamburger recipe like this.

914
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:38,330
I am telling you, it's a secret
American recipe. [chuckles]

915
00:44:38,365 --> 00:44:40,954
No sauerkraut though, or
borscht. [laughs]

916
00:44:40,988 --> 00:44:42,783
Borsh, ke-bor,
how do you say it?

917
00:44:42,818 --> 00:44:43,646
- Borscht.

918
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:44,474
- Borscht.

919
00:44:44,509 --> 00:44:45,406
- Borscht.

920
00:44:45,441 --> 00:44:47,443
- Borscht.
- Borscht, okay. [laughs]

921
00:44:47,477 --> 00:44:48,444
Great, well, thank you.

922
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:50,515
Thank you for letting us come

923
00:44:50,549 --> 00:44:52,379
into your kitchen
and take it over.

924
00:44:52,413 --> 00:44:55,071
I just really wanted to show
you what a dinner could--

925
00:44:55,106 --> 00:44:57,039
- Ya, Americans like to show.

926
00:45:07,325 --> 00:45:11,639
- Watch out boys,
Nadja's gonna blow.

927
00:45:21,304 --> 00:45:22,133
- Eights.

928
00:45:33,523 --> 00:45:37,217
- Eights, Nadja! [laughs]

929
00:45:37,251 --> 00:45:40,392
Gutrune, pull the money from
over there, I can't reach.

930
00:45:40,427 --> 00:45:41,255
- I need coffee.

931
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:43,257
- Nadja, please, bitte!

932
00:45:43,292 --> 00:45:46,019
We only have wine
here at this hour.

933
00:45:46,053 --> 00:45:47,158
Wine.

934
00:45:47,192 --> 00:45:49,919
Gutrune, get Nadja
some more wine.

935
00:45:49,954 --> 00:45:53,336
Ya, a little more for
the whole table.

936
00:45:53,371 --> 00:45:56,443
We need to loosen
our American friends,

937
00:45:56,477 --> 00:45:58,479
they're playing so careful.

938
00:45:58,514 --> 00:45:59,653
- We're losing.

939
00:45:59,687 --> 00:46:02,725
- But really, a few
pennies here und there.

940
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,038
As you say, here und there.

941
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:09,559
Not that wine, Gutrune.

942
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,980
Not that one,
Gutrune, the other one!

943
00:46:16,014 --> 00:46:17,671
The one that's...

944
00:46:17,705 --> 00:46:20,501
[speaks angrily in German]

945
00:46:20,536 --> 00:46:25,023
Well, we are doing quite
well, exceeding expectations.

946
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,268
- What do you mean,
expectations?

947
00:46:28,302 --> 00:46:30,339
- Leni has dragged most pots.

948
00:46:30,373 --> 00:46:31,581
- Und yet you keep playing.

949
00:46:31,616 --> 00:46:33,583
- We are the only ones left.

950
00:46:33,618 --> 00:46:34,964
- Almost.

951
00:46:34,999 --> 00:46:37,173
There's still a few
units here und there.

952
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:38,623
The boys for example.

953
00:46:38,657 --> 00:46:40,694
- Sorry, I'm just a little
bit, I don't understand.

954
00:46:40,728 --> 00:46:41,868
- They have played most of

955
00:46:41,902 --> 00:46:43,766
the owners in the
building and won.

956
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:44,732
- Won what?

957
00:46:44,767 --> 00:46:46,458
- The units!

958
00:46:46,493 --> 00:46:49,185
- Wait, did, for the, really?

959
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:50,946
- Yeah of course, why not?

960
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:51,809
- Are you kicking them out?

961
00:46:51,843 --> 00:46:52,810
- No.

962
00:46:52,844 --> 00:46:54,259
Well, some.

963
00:46:54,294 --> 00:46:56,710
Most pay rent,
the ones we don't evict.

964
00:46:56,744 --> 00:46:59,368
- Extreme rent increases.

965
00:46:59,402 --> 00:47:02,474
- Get your elbows off the
table Gutrune, please!

966
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:05,236
So rude.

967
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:07,479
- We used to join with
them to beat the others,

968
00:47:07,514 --> 00:47:08,480
but not anymore.

969
00:47:08,515 --> 00:47:10,344
- Not anymore!

970
00:47:10,379 --> 00:47:12,036
- So you lose a lot.

971
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:14,728
Why do you keep playing?

972
00:47:17,144 --> 00:47:17,938
- Pride.

973
00:47:17,973 --> 00:47:19,215
- I see you.

974
00:47:21,321 --> 00:47:23,012
Und raise you.

975
00:47:25,704 --> 00:47:26,602
2,000.

976
00:47:30,054 --> 00:47:32,919
Are you unveiling?

977
00:47:32,953 --> 00:47:34,058
Are you able?

978
00:47:34,921 --> 00:47:39,304
I will of course understand
if you are unable.

979
00:47:39,339 --> 00:47:40,167
- I am able.

980
00:47:40,202 --> 00:47:42,204
- Then what's the problem, hm?

981
00:47:42,238 --> 00:47:44,206
We are waiting,
the boys are bored.

982
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,380
They are shpectators.

983
00:47:46,415 --> 00:47:47,761
They want to go home
and watch YouTube,

984
00:47:47,795 --> 00:47:49,452
if you don't make your move.

985
00:47:49,487 --> 00:47:50,453
- I will move.

986
00:47:50,488 --> 00:47:51,730
- Soon?

987
00:47:51,765 --> 00:47:52,904
[speaks in Russian]

988
00:47:52,939 --> 00:47:55,182
- Okay, we are ready, ya?

989
00:47:55,217 --> 00:47:56,011
- I would say.

990
00:47:56,045 --> 00:47:59,290
- I would say here we go.

991
00:48:00,256 --> 00:48:02,741
Three aces, und you?

992
00:48:05,434 --> 00:48:07,160
Two twos?

993
00:48:07,194 --> 00:48:10,646
Nadja, so crazy, can you
believe!

994
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:15,685
Okay, so that makes 2,000
from Nadja tonight so far,

995
00:48:16,997 --> 00:48:21,691
and 200 from hamburger
und his helpers.

996
00:48:21,726 --> 00:48:24,936
A little wound,
but not too sharp.

997
00:48:24,971 --> 00:48:28,181
Gutrune, you know what I think?

998
00:48:28,215 --> 00:48:33,082
I am beginning to think
that the boys are just that.

999
00:48:33,117 --> 00:48:34,670
Boys.

1000
00:48:34,704 --> 00:48:36,568
Not men. [laughs]

1001
00:48:36,603 --> 00:48:37,638
Oh well.

1002
00:48:37,673 --> 00:48:38,605
- Let's go again.

1003
00:48:39,468 --> 00:48:42,540
- I'll see your 100,
Patrick meine friend,

1004
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:47,338
und raise you 2,000.

1005
00:48:47,372 --> 00:48:49,202
- We don't have
cash like that on hand.

1006
00:48:49,236 --> 00:48:50,479
- I see.

1007
00:48:50,513 --> 00:48:53,309
Well what about
your parking spot?

1008
00:48:53,344 --> 00:48:54,759
You have one, right?

1009
00:48:54,793 --> 00:48:57,693
In the building, spot 22?

1010
00:48:59,005 --> 00:49:00,696
What do you say?

1011
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:03,181
Where's the harm,
it's not your home!

1012
00:49:03,216 --> 00:49:05,597
You can park on
the street if you lose.

1013
00:49:05,632 --> 00:49:09,463
Get a permit, no big deal,
as they say.

1014
00:49:09,498 --> 00:49:10,292
- All right.

1015
00:49:10,326 --> 00:49:11,258
- All right!

1016
00:49:11,293 --> 00:49:12,087
Nadja?

1017
00:49:12,121 --> 00:49:12,984
- Fold.

1018
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:13,847
- Really?

1019
00:49:13,881 --> 00:49:16,470
Nadja fold, so crazy.

1020
00:49:16,505 --> 00:49:17,333
- We fold.

1021
00:49:18,817 --> 00:49:19,922
- Is that true?

1022
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:22,131
- Yeah, we fold.

1023
00:49:23,995 --> 00:49:24,892
- You take stock?

1024
00:49:24,927 --> 00:49:26,687
- Why not, we take
everything else.

1025
00:49:26,722 --> 00:49:27,550
- Hold these.

1026
00:49:30,174 --> 00:49:31,278
- Let him do it.

1027
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:35,765
- 5,000.

1028
00:49:38,527 --> 00:49:40,460
- You are bluffing.

1029
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:42,427
Well?

1030
00:49:46,466 --> 00:49:50,125
Well, three queens! [laughs]

1031
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:51,919
So appropriate, so true!

1032
00:49:54,957 --> 00:49:58,029
Ya, how terrible for you.

1033
00:49:58,064 --> 00:50:01,343
Gutrune, make sure you
get a note for the stock.

1034
00:50:01,377 --> 00:50:02,758
Don't lose it, Gutrune.

1035
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:05,519
If you do I will be in
a very bad mood.

1036
00:50:05,554 --> 00:50:10,524
You see I find it so amusing
that you boys arrive,

1037
00:50:10,904 --> 00:50:12,526
relatively new to the scene,

1038
00:50:12,561 --> 00:50:15,115
und you tell Gutrune and myself

1039
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:19,706
and even Nadja und Olga und
who knows who else you spoke to

1040
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:24,090
that your polygamous way
is not only the best way,

1041
00:50:24,124 --> 00:50:29,129
but the one and only way,
und at the root of this way,

1042
00:50:30,096 --> 00:50:34,238
is some notion of
what is fair to do.

1043
00:50:34,272 --> 00:50:38,449
Yet from the moment you
have walked in here,

1044
00:50:38,483 --> 00:50:40,520
you have done nothing but push

1045
00:50:40,554 --> 00:50:43,730
poor little Frankie around
like the garden maid.

1046
00:50:43,764 --> 00:50:45,525
It's very confusing.

1047
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:48,562
Had you listened to him you
might still have a parking spot.

1048
00:50:48,597 --> 00:50:49,667
[chuckles]

1049
00:50:49,701 --> 00:50:54,292
But, what is true
is that you are

1050
00:50:54,327 --> 00:50:57,019
no more equal to each other

1051
00:50:57,054 --> 00:51:01,265
than Olga and Gutrune
are to Nadja and myself.

1052
00:51:01,299 --> 00:51:04,302
The only difference is we are

1053
00:51:04,337 --> 00:51:06,684
just a little more
obvious about it.

1054
00:51:07,581 --> 00:51:10,343
I call the shots, remember?

1055
00:51:12,483 --> 00:51:13,898
So?

1056
00:51:13,932 --> 00:51:15,072
Want to go again?

1057
00:51:19,662 --> 00:51:21,595
What about your apartment?

1058
00:51:31,502 --> 00:51:34,229
I'm afraid you're
still a little short.

1059
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,750
How about ownership of your
blog, hm?

1060
00:51:40,545 --> 00:51:42,685
Gutrune, can you believe?

1061
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,413
We are willing to put all
the units on the line,

1062
00:51:46,448 --> 00:51:50,314
but they would rather lose
most than gain everything.

1063
00:51:50,348 --> 00:51:51,453
- If we throw our unit in,

1064
00:51:51,487 --> 00:51:53,040
will you split the
earnings with us?

1065
00:51:53,075 --> 00:51:53,903
- Yes.

1066
00:51:55,181 --> 00:51:57,424
- I don't want to live here
if this bitch runs the joint.

1067
00:51:57,459 --> 00:51:59,357
- So, here we go.

1068
00:52:01,532 --> 00:52:02,326
Flush!

1069
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,913
You see, I win again!

1070
00:52:05,363 --> 00:52:06,192
- Yes!

1071
00:52:06,226 --> 00:52:07,710
Yes!

1072
00:52:07,745 --> 00:52:09,540
- What are you doing,
what are you doing?

1073
00:52:09,574 --> 00:52:10,713
What is he doing?

1074
00:52:10,748 --> 00:52:12,543
You can't give apartment
back, she doesn't deserve it!

1075
00:52:12,577 --> 00:52:13,854
- We'll handle giving
back the units

1076
00:52:13,889 --> 00:52:15,166
on the first five floors.

1077
00:52:15,201 --> 00:52:16,547
You handle giving back the rest.

1078
00:52:16,581 --> 00:52:17,858
- We're not giving back.

1079
00:52:17,893 --> 00:52:18,687
- What do you mean?

1080
00:52:18,721 --> 00:52:20,067
- We're taking over as landlord.

1081
00:52:20,102 --> 00:52:21,068
- Wait, you're kicking them out?

1082
00:52:21,103 --> 00:52:22,967
- Not kicking out, but we won.

1083
00:52:23,001 --> 00:52:24,589
- Wait a minute, how is this
any better than the Germans?

1084
00:52:24,624 --> 00:52:27,523
- I'd worry about your half.

1085
00:52:27,558 --> 00:52:29,456
There are lots of thing.

1086
00:52:29,491 --> 00:52:32,149
- I should've kept the
Russians out of it.

1087
00:52:32,183 --> 00:52:33,460
- Well, we needed them.

1088
00:52:33,495 --> 00:52:35,497
- We at least made
a ton of money.

1089
00:52:35,531 --> 00:52:36,463
- Mm, yeah.

1090
00:52:36,498 --> 00:52:40,157
[dramatic orchestral music]

1091
00:53:07,977 --> 00:53:09,945
- [Doctor] It's looking good,
kid.

1092
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,377
- Oh, fuck.

1093
00:54:01,928 --> 00:54:05,000
[light guitar music]

1094
00:54:48,768 --> 00:54:50,735
- Katrina wants to have
us over on the 15th

1095
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:53,013
to meet her new girl friends.

1096
00:54:53,048 --> 00:54:55,602
- I'll make sure I put
that in my calendar.

1097
00:54:55,637 --> 00:54:57,121
- I had a shit day, you know.

1098
00:54:57,155 --> 00:54:58,571
Just dreadful, with the blog.

1099
00:54:58,605 --> 00:54:59,882
But thank God I have it.

1100
00:54:59,917 --> 00:55:02,126
It keeps me mentally active.

1101
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,714
Critical thinking, you know.

1102
00:55:03,748 --> 00:55:05,336
It's important to stay critical.

1103
00:55:06,579 --> 00:55:08,581
Is the 15th good for you,
Frankie?

1104
00:55:08,615 --> 00:55:09,651
You gonna be able to fit it in,

1105
00:55:09,685 --> 00:55:10,893
what with your busy schedule?

1106
00:55:10,928 --> 00:55:11,860
- Mm-hm.

1107
00:55:11,894 --> 00:55:12,826
- [Patrick] You know
you've been spending

1108
00:55:12,861 --> 00:55:13,724
a lot of time in front
of the TV lately.

1109
00:55:13,758 --> 00:55:14,552
You think that's a good idea?

1110
00:55:14,587 --> 00:55:15,553
- Leave him alone.

1111
00:55:15,588 --> 00:55:17,210
- Indolence is never
an attractive quality.

1112
00:55:17,244 --> 00:55:18,245
- It isn't indolence.

1113
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,971
- I've spent the last
six months gardening and

1114
00:55:20,006 --> 00:55:22,905
building furniture like the
desk you like so much, so.

1115
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:24,907
- Yeah, let him have a
break if he wants it.

1116
00:55:24,942 --> 00:55:25,839
- You want to watch this shit?

1117
00:55:25,874 --> 00:55:26,668
- Yeah, sometimes.

1118
00:55:26,702 --> 00:55:27,945
- Sutton stop it, don't pretend.

1119
00:55:27,979 --> 00:55:28,877
- What difference does it make?

1120
00:55:28,911 --> 00:55:30,327
He's going to school,
he's active.

1121
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:32,294
- He's wasting time wasting
his life on nothing,

1122
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,122
this is nothing.

1123
00:55:33,157 --> 00:55:33,951
- What do you want from him?

1124
00:55:33,985 --> 00:55:34,779
- More than nothing.

1125
00:55:34,814 --> 00:55:35,815
- You live upstairs?

1126
00:55:35,849 --> 00:55:36,954
- Yes, I live upstairs.

1127
00:55:36,988 --> 00:55:40,129
- Right, I'm Sutton, and
this is my partner Patrick.

1128
00:55:40,164 --> 00:55:41,717
- Hey.
- Hello, I'm Sajida.

1129
00:55:41,752 --> 00:55:43,581
- Our other partner is
on the sofa being a lug,

1130
00:55:43,616 --> 00:55:44,410
he's a bit lazy.

1131
00:55:44,444 --> 00:55:46,170
- Would you like some coffee?

1132
00:55:46,204 --> 00:55:47,378
- Yes.
- Or some jello mold?

1133
00:55:47,413 --> 00:55:48,759
We have leftovers.

1134
00:55:48,793 --> 00:55:49,587
- Not really.

1135
00:55:49,622 --> 00:55:50,588
We need your help.

1136
00:55:50,623 --> 00:55:51,520
- How?

1137
00:55:51,555 --> 00:55:52,694
- I'm sure you're
aware of the battle

1138
00:55:52,728 --> 00:55:54,109
we're having with
the neighbors next door.

1139
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:55,213
- The Iranians?

1140
00:55:55,248 --> 00:55:57,112
- They play loud music
to all ends of the night.

1141
00:55:57,146 --> 00:55:59,597
It's very difficult for my wife
to sleep.

1142
00:55:59,632 --> 00:56:01,150
- You have a wife,
who is your wife?

1143
00:56:01,185 --> 00:56:02,117
- Raja.

1144
00:56:02,151 --> 00:56:02,807
- I didn't even know
that you had a wife.

1145
00:56:02,842 --> 00:56:03,670
- Well, okay--

1146
00:56:03,705 --> 00:56:04,775
- I mean I've never
seen her before.

1147
00:56:04,809 --> 00:56:05,707
- Okay, well yes--

1148
00:56:05,741 --> 00:56:08,088
- Isn't she a doctor or
something?

1149
00:56:08,123 --> 00:56:09,676
- No.

1150
00:56:09,711 --> 00:56:11,333
Anyway, that is not the point.

1151
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,783
The point is that I think that

1152
00:56:12,817 --> 00:56:14,785
they're trying to drive
us from the apartment.

1153
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:16,027
- Oh?

1154
00:56:16,062 --> 00:56:17,684
- So they can knock down the
walls and make it one unit.

1155
00:56:17,719 --> 00:56:18,513
- That's awful.

1156
00:56:18,547 --> 00:56:19,376
- Tell me about it.

1157
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:20,618
- I can't believe that.

1158
00:56:20,653 --> 00:56:22,309
- And well everyone knows
that you're doing quite well,

1159
00:56:22,344 --> 00:56:24,311
so I was wondering if you
could consider loaning us

1160
00:56:24,346 --> 00:56:26,313
some money to soundproof
the apartment.

1161
00:56:27,142 --> 00:56:29,627
- Can you really soundproof
an apartment entirely?

1162
00:56:29,662 --> 00:56:31,595
- Well additional installation.

1163
00:56:31,629 --> 00:56:32,941
We'd pay you back, of course.

1164
00:56:32,975 --> 00:56:33,907
- Right, well, um--

1165
00:56:33,942 --> 00:56:35,184
- I'm sure you're
aware of how much

1166
00:56:35,219 --> 00:56:36,531
instability there is in the
building,

1167
00:56:36,565 --> 00:56:38,015
and well, I don't know
if you're heard,

1168
00:56:38,049 --> 00:56:40,811
but Nadja is finding it hard

1169
00:56:40,845 --> 00:56:42,778
to manage the
units they took over.

1170
00:56:42,813 --> 00:56:43,607
- Oh.

1171
00:56:43,641 --> 00:56:44,918
- She might lose them.

1172
00:56:44,953 --> 00:56:46,817
Even still, she offered
to loan us the money,

1173
00:56:46,851 --> 00:56:49,233
but well, I wanted
to approach you first.

1174
00:56:49,267 --> 00:56:50,096
- Uh-huh.

1175
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:51,338
- I don't think it's
a good idea that

1176
00:56:51,373 --> 00:56:53,686
Nadja has so much control
over the building, you know?

1177
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,101
- No, of course not,
we don't either.

1178
00:56:55,135 --> 00:56:56,930
- And we need this.

1179
00:56:56,965 --> 00:56:58,069
We need your help.

1180
00:56:59,277 --> 00:57:02,246
We also have fresh vegetables
growing on our balcony.

1181
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,627
Kale and whatnot.

1182
00:57:03,661 --> 00:57:06,008
My wife says they're better
than the farmer's market.

1183
00:57:06,043 --> 00:57:07,182
Take as much as you want.

1184
00:57:07,216 --> 00:57:08,079
- You know.
- I know.

1185
00:57:08,114 --> 00:57:09,046
- Frankie's doctor said...

1186
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,737
- Frankie's doctor
said that his health is

1187
00:57:10,772 --> 00:57:12,808
dependent on him eating
organic vegetables.

1188
00:57:12,843 --> 00:57:13,637
- What is the matter with him?

1189
00:57:13,671 --> 00:57:15,017
- He's sick.
- He's not well.

1190
00:57:15,052 --> 00:57:16,191
- Is it cancer?

1191
00:57:16,225 --> 00:57:17,123
- No.

1192
00:57:17,157 --> 00:57:18,607
- Well than what,
I don't understand.

1193
00:57:18,642 --> 00:57:21,299
- It's more of a feeling,
a malaise.

1194
00:57:21,334 --> 00:57:22,404
- The fuck is that?

1195
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,301
- It just means that he
needs to eat healthy food.

1196
00:57:23,336 --> 00:57:24,441
- Well there you go!

1197
00:57:24,475 --> 00:57:25,718
We have more than enough.

1198
00:57:25,752 --> 00:57:27,167
What a trade.

1199
00:57:27,202 --> 00:57:28,341
So?

1200
00:57:28,375 --> 00:57:31,137
- You know, Sajida,
I just want to say,

1201
00:57:31,171 --> 00:57:32,897
I really want to emphasize
that the best thing

1202
00:57:32,932 --> 00:57:34,796
that happened to Patrick
and me is Frankie.

1203
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:37,039
And the best advice
that I can give to you

1204
00:57:37,074 --> 00:57:38,040
is to get a second wife.

1205
00:57:38,075 --> 00:57:39,732
Now I know it's not
what you're used to

1206
00:57:39,766 --> 00:57:41,009
or what you came here wanting,

1207
00:57:41,043 --> 00:57:45,600
but a polyamorous relationship
like ours has it's benefits.

1208
00:57:45,634 --> 00:57:47,394
You make a lot more money.

1209
00:57:47,429 --> 00:57:48,741
It's better to make decisions
that way.

1210
00:57:48,775 --> 00:57:52,779
Now, I will talk this over with
Patrick,

1211
00:57:52,814 --> 00:57:54,091
and we'll mention it to Frankie,

1212
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:57,750
but I really hate what
your neighbors are doing

1213
00:57:57,784 --> 00:57:59,165
just like we hate
knowing that Nadja

1214
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:01,029
is in control of so
much of the building.

1215
00:58:01,063 --> 00:58:04,101
But this idea of a
three way relationship,

1216
00:58:04,135 --> 00:58:07,104
I really think that you
should think about it.

1217
00:58:07,138 --> 00:58:08,519
Would you be willing
to think about that?

1218
00:58:08,554 --> 00:58:09,693
- [Patrick] What the
hell was that?

1219
00:58:09,727 --> 00:58:10,590
- [Sutton] I've been thinking
about it,

1220
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:11,591
I've been thinking that we

1221
00:58:11,626 --> 00:58:12,627
never see anyone
from the top floors.

1222
00:58:12,661 --> 00:58:13,904
They never come to
any of the parties.

1223
00:58:13,938 --> 00:58:14,801
- [Patrick] That doesn't mean--

1224
00:58:14,836 --> 00:58:15,664
- [Sutton] We need
to be a little bit

1225
00:58:15,699 --> 00:58:16,527
more realistic
about our situation.

1226
00:58:16,562 --> 00:58:17,666
We live in a crowded
building where

1227
00:58:17,701 --> 00:58:19,357
half of the apartments
are hostile towards us.

1228
00:58:19,392 --> 00:58:21,359
I think it's a good idea
to send a message

1229
00:58:21,394 --> 00:58:22,499
of generosity and then we have

1230
00:58:22,533 --> 00:58:24,155
one more neighbor who likes us.

1231
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:26,226
And I think that she
really took to my idea

1232
00:58:26,261 --> 00:58:28,056
of getting a third person
in her relationship.

1233
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:29,885
I mean I think it would solve
a lot of their problems.

1234
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,197
- [Patrick] Yeah, I don't
think she took to it.

1235
00:58:31,231 --> 00:58:32,474
- [Sutton] Well why
wouldn't she take to it?

1236
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,752
- Well I said not everyone
thinks it's such a good idea.

1237
00:58:34,787 --> 00:58:35,995
- [Sutton] Well you
think it's a good idea.

1238
00:58:36,029 --> 00:58:37,997
- Well yeah I know, but for
us, not everyone's like us.

1239
00:58:38,031 --> 00:58:39,205
I don't know why it's so
important

1240
00:58:39,239 --> 00:58:40,689
for you to do what we do.

1241
00:58:40,724 --> 00:58:41,690
We've had this
conversation before.

1242
00:58:41,725 --> 00:58:42,933
- [Sutton] Can we just
give them the money?

1243
00:58:42,967 --> 00:58:43,761
Let's just give them the money.

1244
00:58:43,796 --> 00:58:44,624
I mean if we don't,

1245
00:58:44,659 --> 00:58:45,591
then things are just gonna get

1246
00:58:45,625 --> 00:58:47,696
worse between
Sajida and the Iranians,

1247
00:58:47,731 --> 00:58:50,457
and we're gonna have more of
Nadja's shit to deal with.

1248
00:58:51,562 --> 00:58:53,115
If we say no and Nadja
gives them the money,

1249
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:54,185
then they'll resent us for it.

1250
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:55,773
I mean Frankie wants to do this.

1251
00:58:55,808 --> 00:58:56,809
- [Patrick] Frankie's
watching reruns,

1252
00:58:56,843 --> 00:58:58,362
he doesn't give a
shit about this.

1253
00:58:58,396 --> 00:58:59,328
- [Sutton] Frankie!

1254
00:59:01,192 --> 00:59:02,435
- [Frankie] Yeah?

1255
00:59:02,469 --> 00:59:03,609
- [Sutton] Should we
give the Iraqis

1256
00:59:03,643 --> 00:59:05,714
some money to
soundproof their apartment?

1257
00:59:08,752 --> 00:59:09,580
Frankie?

1258
00:59:09,615 --> 00:59:10,685
- What?

1259
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,824
- [Sutton] Should we give
the Iraqis some money?

1260
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:15,344
- 'Kay.

1261
00:59:15,379 --> 00:59:16,622
- See?
- Fine.

1262
00:59:16,656 --> 00:59:20,315
[dramatic orchestral music]

1263
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:33,880
[water trickling]

1264
00:59:45,133 --> 00:59:47,791
[cartoon music]

1265
00:59:55,453 --> 00:59:59,112
[dramatic orchestral music]

1266
01:00:06,326 --> 01:00:09,122
- I saw this one pasty girl
with like stringy red hair.

1267
01:00:09,157 --> 01:00:11,573
And the guy is like,
"Can we shave your head?"

1268
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,471
And then they take
her hair and this like

1269
01:00:13,506 --> 01:00:14,472
big ball of butter you know and

1270
01:00:14,507 --> 01:00:16,820
they mash the butter
and her hair together.

1271
01:00:16,854 --> 01:00:17,648
And she's gotta eat it.

1272
01:00:17,683 --> 01:00:18,822
And so she eats it,

1273
01:00:18,856 --> 01:00:20,271
she gets like a certain
amount of money or something.

1274
01:00:20,306 --> 01:00:22,204
The whole time she's
eating it, she's like,

1275
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:24,103
she's like gagging and
struggling and like

1276
01:00:24,137 --> 01:00:26,139
puking it right back up.

1277
01:00:26,174 --> 01:00:28,728
But guess how
much she did it for?

1278
01:00:28,763 --> 01:00:29,591
- [Sutton] How much?

1279
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:30,523
- 20 bucks!
- That's it?

1280
01:00:30,557 --> 01:00:32,767
- I know, people are
so fuckin' stupid.

1281
01:00:32,801 --> 01:00:35,114
They'd had to
give me like 20,000

1282
01:00:35,148 --> 01:00:36,218
at least to do
something like that.

1283
01:00:36,253 --> 01:00:38,151
- [Sutton] Well maybe she
just wanted to be on TV.

1284
01:00:38,186 --> 01:00:39,256
- God, that show is so good.

1285
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:41,120
That channel has
the fuckin' best shows.

1286
01:00:41,154 --> 01:00:42,466
- How's school?

1287
01:00:43,881 --> 01:00:45,227
- I don't know.

1288
01:00:45,262 --> 01:00:46,125
- Have you thought
about dropping out maybe

1289
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:47,298
and getting your
real estate license,

1290
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:49,507
or getting a job now so that
you can make some money?

1291
01:00:49,542 --> 01:00:51,061
Don't you think
that'd be a good idea?

1292
01:00:51,095 --> 01:00:52,062
- [Frankie] Actually maybe.

1293
01:00:52,096 --> 01:00:53,201
- I mean you gotta do
what you want to do

1294
01:00:53,235 --> 01:00:54,374
so that you can be happy.

1295
01:00:54,409 --> 01:00:55,306
- [Frankie] Right.

1296
01:00:55,341 --> 01:00:56,376
- If we've learned
anything from this,

1297
01:00:56,411 --> 01:00:57,999
it's to listen to what
you want more,

1298
01:00:58,033 --> 01:01:00,311
and I think the universe is
trying to tell us something

1299
01:01:00,346 --> 01:01:02,451
by giving you the
idea to come out here.

1300
01:01:02,486 --> 01:01:03,867
- [Frankie] Yeah,
I think so too.

1301
01:01:03,901 --> 01:01:07,249
Oh the bathroom ceiling
is actually leaking.

1302
01:01:07,284 --> 01:01:08,423
Tried to brush my
teeth this morning,

1303
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:09,700
water kept dripping on my head.

1304
01:01:09,735 --> 01:01:11,495
- You think she's flooding the
bathroom?

1305
01:01:11,529 --> 01:01:12,530
- [Frankie] Who?

1306
01:01:12,565 --> 01:01:13,359
- Sajida.

1307
01:01:13,393 --> 01:01:14,671
- [Frankie] The Iraqis, really?

1308
01:01:14,705 --> 01:01:15,982
- Well, they live
right above us.

1309
01:01:16,017 --> 01:01:17,052
- [Frankie] Yeah, but why
would they want to do that?

1310
01:01:17,087 --> 01:01:17,915
We do a lot for them.

1311
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:19,814
- You wanna do
something about it?

1312
01:01:19,848 --> 01:01:22,195
- [Frankie] Well, can we
do something about it?

1313
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:23,300
- We could sue.

1314
01:01:23,334 --> 01:01:25,129
And then if we won damages
and they didn't pay us,

1315
01:01:25,164 --> 01:01:26,855
we could get the condo
repossessed.

1316
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:29,064
- [Frankie] Well, will
they even pay us, anyway?

1317
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:30,341
- I know, they probably
wouldn't.

1318
01:01:30,376 --> 01:01:33,379
So then the condo board would
own it and then rent it out.

1319
01:01:34,207 --> 01:01:35,105
- [Frankie] That would
take forever, right?

1320
01:01:35,139 --> 01:01:36,002
- To be honest,

1321
01:01:36,037 --> 01:01:37,901
I met a few other
Iraqi women that

1322
01:01:37,935 --> 01:01:39,523
are in a three way
relationship like us,

1323
01:01:39,557 --> 01:01:41,352
and I think they'd do
something nice with the place.

1324
01:01:41,387 --> 01:01:42,526
- [Frankie] No, I don't
want to buy a condo

1325
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:43,527
or something stupid.
- No, no no no no.

1326
01:01:43,561 --> 01:01:44,873
- [Frankie] And I
don't like that we even

1327
01:01:44,908 --> 01:01:46,012
own these units
in the first place.

1328
01:01:46,047 --> 01:01:48,187
- No, I'd be fine with
them owning it eventually,

1329
01:01:48,221 --> 01:01:50,568
and they seem like nicer women.

1330
01:01:50,603 --> 01:01:52,398
- [Frankie] Okay, yeah.

1331
01:01:52,432 --> 01:01:54,124
- Great, I'll get the
process started.

1332
01:01:54,158 --> 01:01:55,401
Oh and I've been thinking
that it might not be

1333
01:01:55,435 --> 01:01:57,610
such a bad idea if stop putting

1334
01:01:57,644 --> 01:01:59,405
as much money into
our joint bank accounts

1335
01:01:59,439 --> 01:02:00,889
and then more into our
individual ones.

1336
01:02:00,924 --> 01:02:02,546
That way we can get
our own groceries too.

1337
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:04,444
I mean we could go
shop at Smart Mart

1338
01:02:04,479 --> 01:02:05,860
instead of Fresh Foods
all the time.

1339
01:02:05,894 --> 01:02:08,207
♪ You can buy Twinkertots
at Smart Mart ♪

1340
01:02:08,241 --> 01:02:09,139
[laughs]

1341
01:02:09,173 --> 01:02:10,174
- [Patrick] I'm on a deadline,

1342
01:02:10,209 --> 01:02:10,899
but I know we need to
talk about the bathroom.

1343
01:02:10,934 --> 01:02:11,935
Let me just finish this first.

1344
01:02:11,969 --> 01:02:12,729
- Hey, I'm gonna head
to Smart Mart in a sec.

1345
01:02:12,763 --> 01:02:13,764
Do you want anything?

1346
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:14,938
- What are you talking about?

1347
01:02:14,972 --> 01:02:16,249
- [Frankie] I'm gonna
buy me some Twinkertots.

1348
01:02:16,284 --> 01:02:17,078
- Twinkertots?

1349
01:02:17,112 --> 01:02:17,975
- [Frankie] Yeah, I love 'em.

1350
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:19,563
- Those are nothing but sugar.

1351
01:02:19,597 --> 01:02:20,495
Are you out of your mind?

1352
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:21,392
- [Frankie] Well Sutton
says he thinks

1353
01:02:21,427 --> 01:02:22,773
we should all buy our own
groceries,

1354
01:02:22,808 --> 01:02:23,981
we don't have to agree.

1355
01:02:24,016 --> 01:02:25,362
And I can eat whatever
the hell I want.

1356
01:02:25,396 --> 01:02:26,777
- You're not gonna
eat that shit.

1357
01:02:26,812 --> 01:02:28,020
- [Frankie] I think
it's a great idea.

1358
01:02:28,054 --> 01:02:29,228
- Well, then you're ridiculous.

1359
01:02:29,262 --> 01:02:30,125
You're siding with Sutton on

1360
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,057
something that's
going to make you sick.

1361
01:02:31,092 --> 01:02:32,265
What the fuck did
you say to him?

1362
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:34,474
- We're evicting the Iraqis
for flooding the bathroom.

1363
01:02:34,509 --> 01:02:36,511
- [Cathy] People are begging me.

1364
01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:38,582
Cathy, please, please, Cathy.

1365
01:02:38,616 --> 01:02:39,790
You have the most successful

1366
01:02:39,825 --> 01:02:42,275
reality TV show
of all time, okay?

1367
01:02:46,348 --> 01:02:47,660
- What is this?

1368
01:02:47,694 --> 01:02:48,626
- [Sutton] Preliminary letter

1369
01:02:48,661 --> 01:02:50,525
we need to legally
deliver to the Iraqis.

1370
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:52,907
Just stick it under the door
when you have the chance.

1371
01:02:55,185 --> 01:02:56,013
- Fuck.

1372

- [Woman] What the [talking
in foreign language]

1373
01:03:00,362 --> 01:03:01,536
think they can get
away with anything

1374
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:04,263
just because they have more
money than the rest of us?

1375

[yelling in foreign language]

1376
01:03:05,298 --> 01:03:06,886
I never flooded anything!

They're the ones flooding
people's heads with lies.

1378

Fear.

1379
01:03:10,303 --> 01:03:11,235
They cooked this up and the

1380
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:13,686
craven bastards on
the board sold the lie.

1381
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:16,240
They think we need a threesome?

1382
01:03:16,275 --> 01:03:18,484
Try to tell me how
to run my home?

1383
01:03:22,902 --> 01:03:24,766
I'm coming down there.

1384
01:03:29,564 --> 01:03:30,565

[doorbell ringing]

1386
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,440
- You had me out
there for 10 minutes.

1387
01:03:43,474 --> 01:03:44,682
- I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

1388
01:03:44,717 --> 01:03:45,960
Here, just let me
help you with that.

1389
01:03:45,994 --> 01:03:47,064
- Be careful with my wrap.

1390
01:03:47,099 --> 01:03:48,825
My son made my wrap for me.

1391
01:03:48,859 --> 01:03:49,653
- All right.

1392
01:03:49,687 --> 01:03:50,619
- Here kid.

1393
01:03:50,654 --> 01:03:51,758
- What is that?

1394
01:03:51,793 --> 01:03:53,450
- Coupons for your junk food
and sodas that you like.

1395
01:03:53,484 --> 01:03:54,658
- Oh sweet!

1396
01:03:54,692 --> 01:03:56,487
- Also that store where
you get your clothes from

1397
01:03:56,522 --> 01:03:57,868
is having a final sale on those

1398
01:03:57,903 --> 01:04:00,215
little workout shorts that
you wear all the time.

1399
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:01,251
- Hey, thank you.

1400
01:04:01,285 --> 01:04:02,355
How did you know I
like all this stuff?

1401
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:04,288
- Well, I also made
a list of TV shows

1402
01:04:04,323 --> 01:04:06,981
and some porn sites that
you might want to check out.

1403
01:04:07,015 --> 01:04:08,292
Based on your interests.

1404
01:04:08,327 --> 01:04:09,121
- Okay!

1405
01:04:09,155 --> 01:04:11,088
Hey um, I'm almost
out of snacks,

1406
01:04:11,123 --> 01:04:12,469
got these coupons from her.

1407
01:04:12,503 --> 01:04:13,504
Can I please have some money?

1408
01:04:13,539 --> 01:04:15,334
- You need to learn how to
budget better.

1409
01:04:15,368 --> 01:04:16,887
I heard they're hiring
down at Smart Mart.

1410
01:04:16,922 --> 01:04:18,716
- Yeah I already have
three part time jobs.

1411
01:04:18,751 --> 01:04:21,029
- Well, maybe you can ask
your parents for some money.

1412
01:04:21,064 --> 01:04:22,099
- Right, yeah.

1413
01:04:22,928 --> 01:04:24,032
Like they have money.

1414
01:04:24,067 --> 01:04:25,413
It's not like we can all
ask our parents for anyway,

1415
01:04:25,447 --> 01:04:26,863
we don't all have a trust fund.

1416
01:04:26,897 --> 01:04:28,105
- You know Sister Wives is
starting,

1417
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:29,831
maybe you want to
go live tweet about it?

1418
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:30,797
- [Frankie] I'm going.

1419
01:04:31,937 --> 01:04:32,869
- Nadja's broke.

1420
01:04:32,903 --> 01:04:34,663
She can't cover all
of her mortgages.

1421
01:04:34,698 --> 01:04:36,148
Barely holding her own.

1422
01:04:36,182 --> 01:04:38,460
I think her and Olga
are taking another wife,

1423
01:04:38,495 --> 01:04:39,461
if you can believe that.

1424
01:04:39,496 --> 01:04:40,393
- Jeez.

1425
01:04:40,428 --> 01:04:41,601
- You need to nab
these when they go.

1426
01:04:41,636 --> 01:04:42,499
Beyond that,

1427
01:04:42,533 --> 01:04:43,327
I have a list of a
bunch of buildings

1428
01:04:43,362 --> 01:04:44,846
that I think you
boys ought to buy.

1429
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,744
We'll make a bundle
when the bottle blows.

1430
01:04:46,779 --> 01:04:48,263
- You want to buy distressed
properties?

1431
01:04:48,298 --> 01:04:49,886
- Buy the buildings dirt cheap.

1432
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,370
You do some cosmetic
improvements

1433
01:04:51,404 --> 01:04:52,923
that hide the underlying rot,

1434
01:04:52,958 --> 01:04:54,580
and you trick suckers into
snatching them

1435
01:04:54,614 --> 01:04:55,926
in a final sales contract.

1436
01:04:55,961 --> 01:04:56,962
- You want to commit fraud?

1437
01:04:56,996 --> 01:04:58,377
- What the fuck is
wrong with you?

1438
01:04:58,411 --> 01:04:59,896
What the fuck is wrong with him?

1439
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:02,174
I got to talk innocent to him,
is that it?

1440
01:05:02,208 --> 01:05:04,245
Oh, so you want me to lie to you

1441
01:05:04,279 --> 01:05:05,384
so you can say
you weren't there.

1442
01:05:05,418 --> 01:05:06,488
We gonna do this or not?

1443
01:05:06,523 --> 01:05:07,317
- [Sutton] We'll do it.

1444
01:05:07,351 --> 01:05:08,214
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1445
01:05:08,249 --> 01:05:08,974
- [Edith] He gonna go
along with it?

1446
01:05:09,008 --> 01:05:09,871
- He won't stop it.

1447
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:10,665
- I mean look, I just got
acquitted.

1448
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:11,493
I need this.

1449
01:05:11,528 --> 01:05:12,356
- I know.

1450
01:05:12,391 --> 01:05:13,185
- What about Frankie?

1451
01:05:13,219 --> 01:05:14,289
- Frankie's watching Frasier.

1452
01:05:15,187 --> 01:05:16,015
- Fine.

1453
01:05:17,499 --> 01:05:18,638
I'll fill it with some figures

1454
01:05:18,673 --> 01:05:21,538
and finalize the
fine print by Friday.

1455
01:05:21,572 --> 01:05:24,127
[men laughing]

1456
01:05:26,577 --> 01:05:28,407
[video game sounds]
- Die, fucker.

1457
01:05:30,202 --> 01:05:31,030
Yes!

1458
01:05:54,329 --> 01:05:56,262
[burp]

1459
01:05:59,645 --> 01:06:00,887
Fuck, my tooth.

1460
01:06:09,034 --> 01:06:11,277
[groaning]

1461
01:06:35,577 --> 01:06:36,993
I feel like shit.

1462
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:46,899
- [Woman] Telephone please,
Dr. Davis, Telephone please.

1463
01:06:55,287 --> 01:06:56,150
- Look first of all,

1464
01:06:56,184 --> 01:06:57,599
I want to thank Frankie
for allowing me

1465
01:06:57,634 --> 01:06:58,911
to take the lead on
making him well.

1466
01:06:58,945 --> 01:07:00,913
I think we all got sidetracked
from what's really important,

1467
01:07:00,947 --> 01:07:02,225
it'll be nice to implement
some changes

1468
01:07:02,259 --> 01:07:03,881
I believe will make a big
difference.

1469
01:07:03,916 --> 01:07:05,780
At the same time Sutton
I want to be real clear,

1470
01:07:05,814 --> 01:07:07,057
it's important for
us all to agree.

1471
01:07:07,092 --> 01:07:08,783
I'm willing to make some
compromises,

1472
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:11,027
because frankly otherwise
the fighting will never end.

1473
01:07:11,061 --> 01:07:12,718
So the first thing I think we
should do

1474
01:07:12,752 --> 01:07:14,582
is start buying our groceries
again on the joint account.

1475
01:07:14,616 --> 01:07:15,410
- No.

1476
01:07:15,445 --> 01:07:16,515
- Okay, do you
have another idea?

1477
01:07:16,549 --> 01:07:17,723
- Yeah 'cause now that I'm
on my own for expenses,

1478
01:07:17,757 --> 01:07:19,345
I'm kind of having a hard
time paying for food.

1479
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:21,382
I had to pick up another
job at Smart Mart,

1480
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:23,211
and I don't even have time
to watch Dance Palms anymore.

1481
01:07:23,246 --> 01:07:24,557
- I mean it's not a good idea.

1482
01:07:24,592 --> 01:07:26,076
We need to be able to
choose where we shop.

1483
01:07:26,111 --> 01:07:27,595
I mean don't you want
to pick what you eat,

1484
01:07:27,629 --> 01:07:28,596
or do you want Patrick in charge

1485
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:29,562
of what you stick in your mouth?

1486
01:07:29,597 --> 01:07:30,632
- No, I'd like to choose, but--

1487
01:07:30,667 --> 01:07:31,495
- And another thing is Patrick,

1488
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:32,703
the Iraqis are leaving this
weekend,

1489
01:07:32,738 --> 01:07:34,084
I don't want to
discuss letting them stay

1490
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:35,258
if that's what you're thinking.

1491
01:07:35,292 --> 01:07:36,293
Bitch slapped Frankie.

1492
01:07:36,328 --> 01:07:37,122
- She slapped me
across the face.

1493
01:07:37,156 --> 01:07:38,330
- Across the face,
I want her out.

1494
01:07:38,364 --> 01:07:39,158
- Which makes sense.

1495
01:07:39,193 --> 01:07:40,056
- You aren't gonna fuck with

1496
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:40,953
the plan to buy
the building are you?

1497
01:07:40,987 --> 01:07:42,023
'Cause if you are,
I'm calling Edith.

1498
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,197
We'll make more money this way,

1499
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:44,336
and that's good for Frankie,

1500
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:46,200
and we need to
keep making money.

1501
01:07:46,234 --> 01:07:47,649
And since Edith is the only one

1502
01:07:47,684 --> 01:07:49,237
with ideas on how to do that,

1503
01:07:49,272 --> 01:07:50,480
I think that she should have an

1504
01:07:50,514 --> 01:07:52,171
equal say in the
decisions that we make.

1505
01:07:52,206 --> 01:07:53,724
- Well, sorry I just don't
really get that part,

1506
01:07:53,759 --> 01:07:56,072
because she's not in the
relationship with us, so--

1507
01:07:56,106 --> 01:07:57,452
- No no, more like a councilor.

1508
01:07:57,487 --> 01:07:59,696
You don't need
to worry, it'll be fine.

1509
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:02,975
Oh, by the way, we need the
password to your iCloud account.

1510
01:08:03,009 --> 01:08:04,252
- What for?

1511
01:08:04,287 --> 01:08:05,598
- So that we can look at your
photos and track your phone.

1512
01:08:05,633 --> 01:08:07,462
- Uh, why do you
want to track my phone?

1513
01:08:07,497 --> 01:08:08,429
- So that we know where you are.

1514
01:08:08,463 --> 01:08:09,361
- But--

1515
01:08:09,395 --> 01:08:10,120
- [Sutton] You want
to be safe, right?

1516
01:08:10,155 --> 01:08:10,983
- Uh, yeah.

1517
01:08:11,017 --> 01:08:11,915
- [Sutton] Well right now,

1518
01:08:11,949 --> 01:08:13,641
Edith is the only
one with access.

1519
01:08:13,675 --> 01:08:15,125
- Edith's been looking at my
dick picks?

1520
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:17,127
- She has access, I don't
know if she's been looking.

1521
01:08:17,162 --> 01:08:18,335
- What does a lesbian want
to look at my dick for

1522
01:08:18,370 --> 01:08:19,164
and like track me and shit?

1523
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:21,545
- You wanted the phone, right?

1524
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:22,374
- Yeah.

1525
01:08:22,408 --> 01:08:23,892
Well what about the drain clog?

1526
01:08:23,927 --> 01:08:24,755
- [Sutton] What about it?

1527
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:25,618
- Last time Edith was here,

1528
01:08:25,653 --> 01:08:26,964
she showered and
clogged the drain,

1529
01:08:26,999 --> 01:08:28,138
and it still hasn't been fixed.

1530
01:08:28,173 --> 01:08:29,450
- I agree, that's terrible.

1531
01:08:29,484 --> 01:08:30,278
- I'll call a plumber.

1532
01:08:30,313 --> 01:08:31,279
- No, that's not a good idea.

1533
01:08:31,314 --> 01:08:32,142
- Then what?

1534
01:08:32,177 --> 01:08:33,178
- That's another thing, Patrick.

1535
01:08:33,212 --> 01:08:34,455
You've been in charge
of household repairs.

1536
01:08:34,489 --> 01:08:35,594
And whenever you're in
charge you say you're

1537
01:08:35,628 --> 01:08:37,561
going to fix things and
then they never get fixed.

1538
01:08:37,596 --> 01:08:38,493
- It's true, they're not fixed.

1539
01:08:38,528 --> 01:08:39,701
- Because you won't
call the plumber!

1540
01:08:39,736 --> 01:08:41,565
- Frankie doesn't want us
wasting money on a plumber,

1541
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:42,773
and I don't even use that
bathroom.

1542
01:08:42,808 --> 01:08:43,705
What else you got?

1543
01:08:45,466 --> 01:08:47,847
- You've got other ideas, right?

1544
01:08:47,882 --> 01:08:48,779
- You all right?
- No!

1545
01:08:48,814 --> 01:08:50,678
I'm not, actually,
I'm fuckin' pissed.

1546
01:08:50,712 --> 01:08:53,232
You know what,
now that I think about it,

1547
01:08:53,267 --> 01:08:55,096
you need to stay out of my
business.

1548
01:08:56,062 --> 01:08:57,478
And give me some more
independence for Christ sake.

1549
01:08:57,512 --> 01:08:58,548
I can make my own choices,

1550
01:08:58,582 --> 01:09:01,758
and you need to
buy me more shit!

1551
01:09:01,792 --> 01:09:02,862
I can't afford to deal
with this on my own.

1552
01:09:02,897 --> 01:09:04,278
I need medicine and doctors
visits

1553
01:09:04,312 --> 01:09:05,589
and my goddamn Twintertots.

1554
01:09:05,624 --> 01:09:07,350
I mean is that so hard?

1555
01:09:07,384 --> 01:09:09,179
I want you two to be positive,

1556
01:09:09,214 --> 01:09:10,249
and all you are is negative!

1557
01:09:10,284 --> 01:09:11,595
You never agree on anything,

1558
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:13,735
and Sutton you never want
to do anything differently,

1559
01:09:13,770 --> 01:09:15,081
and you always make
some promise about

1560
01:09:15,116 --> 01:09:16,704
some new fucking ideas
about how to change things,

1561
01:09:16,738 --> 01:09:17,946
but I don't know,

1562
01:09:17,981 --> 01:09:18,947
to me it sounds a lot like
things are gonna stay the same.

1563
01:09:18,982 --> 01:09:20,225
And don't think I don't
know that you're suing

1564
01:09:20,259 --> 01:09:21,916
the Yemanese and her
biker bitch girlfriend,

1565
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:23,435
and threatening the Sudanese on

1566
01:09:23,469 --> 01:09:24,539
the third floor with
the same fate,

1567
01:09:24,574 --> 01:09:26,334
even though I specifically
said I don't want us

1568
01:09:26,369 --> 01:09:28,785
getting involved in other
people's unit!

1569
01:09:28,819 --> 01:09:31,028
And why, because you're Suda
will fucking call you out?

1570
01:09:31,063 --> 01:09:32,202
If they flood the
bathroom again?

1571
01:09:32,237 --> 01:09:34,273
I mean Jesus, let them,
they're three floors below us!

1572
01:09:34,308 --> 01:09:36,033
It's none of our goddamn
business!

1573
01:09:36,862 --> 01:09:39,244
And you know
what's next I suppose is

1574
01:09:39,278 --> 01:09:40,797
kicking out the Iranians, yeah?

1575
01:09:40,831 --> 01:09:42,523
Who by the way are storing
up all kinds of shit,

1576
01:09:42,557 --> 01:09:44,628
jamming the fucking garbage
shoot and other hazards,

1577
01:09:44,663 --> 01:09:46,078
causing a fuck ton of dangers
that neither of you two

1578
01:09:46,112 --> 01:09:47,735
are doing anything about
because you're too busy

1579
01:09:47,769 --> 01:09:49,426
trying to get the same
access to my phone

1580
01:09:49,461 --> 01:09:51,739
that Edith apparently does
instead of fucking trusting me.

1581
01:09:51,773 --> 01:09:53,050
That's the fucking
point of this!

1582
01:09:53,085 --> 01:09:55,467
I mean, I don't know, I don't
feel well, I want to lie down.

1583
01:10:00,368 --> 01:10:03,060
[pots clanging]

1584
01:10:04,234 --> 01:10:05,028
- Don't start.

1585
01:10:05,062 --> 01:10:05,856
- You're a liar.

1586
01:10:05,891 --> 01:10:06,892
[scoffs]

1587
01:10:06,926 --> 01:10:07,996
You want one thing and
you advocate another.

1588
01:10:08,031 --> 01:10:09,791
You say you want everyone
to decide for themselves

1589
01:10:09,826 --> 01:10:11,137
and then you make big
blundering decisions you want

1590
01:10:11,172 --> 01:10:12,656
everyone to go along with.
- That you go along with.

1591
01:10:12,691 --> 01:10:14,002
- And I hate you for it.

1592
01:10:14,037 --> 01:10:14,831
- You don't hate me.

1593
01:10:14,865 --> 01:10:15,659
- Oh no?

1594
01:10:15,694 --> 01:10:16,591
- You don't hate me.

1595
01:10:16,626 --> 01:10:17,868
- Then what is it
exactly that I hate?

1596
01:10:17,903 --> 01:10:20,354
Why don't you tell me, just
so I can have a general idea.

1597
01:10:22,942 --> 01:10:23,771
- You're weak.

1598
01:10:35,334 --> 01:10:38,164
- [Frankie] Oh hey, sorry,
are you that clown from TV?

1599
01:10:38,199 --> 01:10:38,993
- [Cathy] Yeah, hey kid.

1600
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:40,166
- [Frankie] Do you live here?

1601
01:10:40,201 --> 01:10:41,927
- [Cathy] Oh yeah, too long.

1602
01:10:41,961 --> 01:10:44,757
- [Frankie] I love your show,
it's the best show ever.

1603
01:10:44,792 --> 01:10:45,931
- [Cathy] Yeah, that right?

1604
01:10:45,965 --> 01:10:47,277
Just wait, I've got
a new show coming,

1605
01:10:47,312 --> 01:10:48,347
it's gonna be even better.

1606
01:10:48,382 --> 01:10:49,728
The best.
- Cool.

1607
01:10:49,762 --> 01:10:50,625
- [Cathy] Yeah,
network is gonna give us

1608
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:52,455
some money to fix up the
building, too.

1609
01:10:52,489 --> 01:10:54,250
You know, redo the
lobby and that.

1610
01:10:54,284 --> 01:10:55,492
- [Frankie] Sweet.

1611
01:10:55,527 --> 01:10:57,287
- [Cathy] We need new ways
of doing things around here,

1612
01:10:57,322 --> 01:10:59,013
otherwise shit never gets done.

1613
01:10:59,047 --> 01:11:00,773
It's a complete
fucking disaster.

1614
01:11:00,808 --> 01:11:02,775
- [Frankie] Yeah, you tell me.

1615
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:05,261
- [Cathy] Hey, you got
time for a soda?

1616
01:11:06,641 --> 01:11:09,886
- [Frankie] Can I
have ice cream in it?

1617
01:11:14,339 --> 01:11:15,340
You know I was
thinking that we should

1618
01:11:15,374 --> 01:11:16,927
have somebody to like
decide things for us.

1619
01:11:16,962 --> 01:11:17,928
- [Sutton] You mean like an
advisor?

1620
01:11:17,963 --> 01:11:19,067
That's why we have Edith.

1621
01:11:19,102 --> 01:11:20,034
- [Frankie] No no
not like an advisor,

1622
01:11:20,068 --> 01:11:21,311
like somebody who
can really run stuff.

1623
01:11:21,346 --> 01:11:22,312
- [Sutton] Like,
what do you mean?

1624
01:11:22,347 --> 01:11:23,451
- [Frankie] Think like
Cathy down the hall.

1625
01:11:23,486 --> 01:11:24,866
- [Sutton] The clown lady
with the reality show?

1626
01:11:24,901 --> 01:11:26,109
- [Frankie] Yeah, she's
got a ton of money,

1627
01:11:26,143 --> 01:11:28,249
I think she'd be really great
at helping us manage ours.

1628
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:29,146
And she said if you
wanted to keep

1629
01:11:29,181 --> 01:11:30,389
more funds in your
account you don't

1630
01:11:30,424 --> 01:11:31,356
have to put it in the joint
account.

1631
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:32,218
That's what you've always
wanted, right?

1632
01:11:32,253 --> 01:11:33,461
- Did you talk with her?

1633
01:11:33,496 --> 01:11:35,152
- I'm gonna have way more money
than you and Patrick soon,

1634
01:11:35,187 --> 01:11:36,326
I don't want to be spreading it
around.

1635
01:11:36,361 --> 01:11:37,189
- She said that?

1636
01:11:37,223 --> 01:11:38,086
- I just think it's lucky.

1637
01:11:38,121 --> 01:11:39,018
I think it's lucky that we found
someone

1638
01:11:39,053 --> 01:11:40,330
from one of my favorite TV shows

1639
01:11:40,365 --> 01:11:41,607
who wants to call
the shots and wants to

1640
01:11:41,642 --> 01:11:43,885
help us solve everything that
we can't seem to right now.

1641
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,266
- You know I don't think that
she'll--

1642
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,854
- I'm tired of trusting Patrick.

1643
01:11:46,888 --> 01:11:48,994
You know sometimes he
can be a real drag.

1644
01:11:49,028 --> 01:11:49,822
- Right.

1645
01:11:49,857 --> 01:11:50,789
- I have some other ideas too.

1646
01:11:50,823 --> 01:11:51,928
- Like what?

1647
01:11:51,962 --> 01:11:53,274
- I think we need to get
back to watching TV together

1648
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,689
instead of you guys
reading books all the time

1649
01:11:54,724 --> 01:11:56,898
and eat food like
cookies and french fries.

1650
01:11:56,933 --> 01:11:58,797
These neighbors don't need to
come over for visits anymore.

1651
01:11:58,831 --> 01:11:59,901
You know, like you said,

1652
01:11:59,936 --> 01:12:01,351
they're gonna want to
spend the night I bet,

1653
01:12:01,386 --> 01:12:03,008
and eat all my Twinkertots and

1654
01:12:03,042 --> 01:12:04,354
make a mess and
not do any house work.

1655
01:12:04,389 --> 01:12:05,355
- Did I say that?

1656
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:06,460
- You know, we're better off
without them.

1657
01:12:06,494 --> 01:12:08,220
Oh, by the way, I decided
to drop out of school.

1658
01:12:08,254 --> 01:12:09,290
You know like you said,
who needs it.

1659
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:10,533
- You really want to
take the risk

1660
01:12:10,567 --> 01:12:12,224
of letting this crazy lady
control things?

1661
01:12:12,258 --> 01:12:13,259
- Whatever, I'm just
sick of this.

1662
01:12:13,294 --> 01:12:14,399
If it's not Cathy now,

1663
01:12:14,433 --> 01:12:15,296
it's gonna be someone else
eventually,

1664
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,436
because you guys
can't figure it out.

1665
01:12:17,471 --> 01:12:18,713
- Right.

1666
01:12:18,748 --> 01:12:19,990
- [Frankie] So, you cool?

1667
01:12:21,923 --> 01:12:22,959
- Well.

1668
01:12:22,993 --> 01:12:24,788
- Those three Iraqi
women moved in yesterday,

1669
01:12:24,823 --> 01:12:26,825
they're already threatening
to flood the entire floor,

1670
01:12:26,859 --> 01:12:28,067
and what did I say?

1671
01:12:28,102 --> 01:12:29,759
Did I not say?

1672
01:12:29,793 --> 01:12:31,554
Very unstable.

1673
01:12:31,588 --> 01:12:33,072
I won't consent to your scheme

1674
01:12:33,107 --> 01:12:34,729
unless we implement
some changes for safety

1675
01:12:34,764 --> 01:12:36,006
or else this is
getting out of control.

1676
01:12:36,041 --> 01:12:37,111
- Fine.

1677
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:38,354
- I want to make sure I do
what's best for Frankie.

1678
01:12:38,388 --> 01:12:40,114
- [laughs] Right.

1679
01:12:40,148 --> 01:12:41,218
- The hell is that
supposed to mean?

1680
01:12:41,253 --> 01:12:42,979
- Chumps and salesmen,
that's what it is.

1681
01:12:43,013 --> 01:12:45,947
Nice try sweet pea, but
you do what's best for you.

1682
01:12:45,982 --> 01:12:47,190
- You know what Edith--

1683
01:12:47,224 --> 01:12:49,088
- You ever look at that kid
and think maybe this is it?

1684
01:12:49,123 --> 01:12:51,021
Not that the opportunity
isn't there,

1685
01:12:51,056 --> 01:12:53,230
opportunity is irrelevant.

1686
01:12:53,265 --> 01:12:56,475
He might want to, but
he will never be you.

1687
01:12:57,407 --> 01:12:59,064
You wouldn't want that anyway.

1688
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:03,344
No more good can be attempted
than the kid can bear,

1689
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,933
and the kid can't
bear any more good.

1690
01:13:07,693 --> 01:13:09,385
Sutton accepts who he is.

1691
01:13:09,419 --> 01:13:10,386
Who's he gonna go along with?

1692
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:11,939
- Look, I believe in
what we're doing.

1693
01:13:11,973 --> 01:13:14,666
- Or is it just that you've
been doing it for so long,

1694
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:16,012
your beef ain't with them?

1695
01:13:17,082 --> 01:13:20,741
[dramatic orchestral music]

1696
01:13:23,606 --> 01:13:25,918
- Look, I already got
Edith to consent to changes

1697
01:13:25,953 --> 01:13:28,542
if we're gonna go along
with buying those buildings.

1698
01:13:30,682 --> 01:13:31,648
[toilet flushes]

1699
01:13:31,683 --> 01:13:33,547
So see, we're making
some real progress here.

1700
01:13:39,656 --> 01:13:41,071
- Okay, this one's for you.

1701
01:13:42,521 --> 01:13:45,455
So this one's jump,
square and circle.

1702
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:46,491
- Jump is X.

1703
01:13:46,525 --> 01:13:48,838
- And then punch, kick,
and that's throw stuff.

1704
01:13:48,872 --> 01:13:50,460
- Punch, kick, throw stuff.
- And you hold these down

1705
01:13:50,495 --> 01:13:53,049
for special moves, there's
like fire and stuff too.

1706
01:13:53,877 --> 01:13:56,397
Now you just get to pick
whoever you want to be.

1707
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:59,055
- I want to be the red one.

1708
01:13:59,089 --> 01:14:00,712
- I will be the lady one.

1709
01:14:00,746 --> 01:14:02,576
- Oh, right. [laughs]

1710
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:04,094
This one is throw, right?

1711
01:14:04,129 --> 01:14:04,957
- Yeah.
- Okay, all right.

1712
01:14:04,992 --> 01:14:06,752
- Prepare to die!

1713
01:14:08,202 --> 01:14:09,030
- [Sutton] Okay, ready?

1714
01:14:09,065 --> 01:14:11,481
[video game beeps]
- Yes!

1715
01:14:11,516 --> 01:14:12,378
Boom!

1716
01:14:13,897 --> 01:14:16,072
- [Sutton] Oh oh oh oh oh!

1717
01:14:17,107 --> 01:14:17,936
Boom.

1718
01:14:18,937 --> 01:14:20,525
- [Frankie] Eat that, yep, yep!

1719
01:14:20,559 --> 01:14:21,940
- [Sutton] Oh! [laughs]

1720
01:14:21,974 --> 01:14:24,045
- [Frankie] There it is!
