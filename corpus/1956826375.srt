1
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:13,294
(Whispering)

2
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,464
Hello.
You called for a distiller?

3
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:52,600
Yes, come in.

4
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:54,935
I spoke with a man on the phone..

5
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,437
Moses.
Yes, Moses.

6
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,872
He said 9:00.
I assumed he meant p.m.

7
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:02,743
P.M. is prime time.
I've missed my stories.

8
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,312
Well, I guess I thought
since they come out

9
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:05,813
at night, that that would mean..

10
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,915
No, they come out all the time,
we just notice them

11
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:10,484
more at night because you don't
have anything better to do.

12
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,921
And your name is?

13
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:15,789
My name is Matthew Moon.

14
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,891
Has it been happening
all over the house?

15
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,860
Mostly in the study, although
we've been hearing them

16
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:21,429
in other places as well.

17
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,864
Just hearing?
You haven't seen anything?

18
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:25,065
We've had several items go missing.

19
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,468
We thought someone had
been stealing from us.

20
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,804
What about batteries going dead

21
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:32,039
before they're supposed to?

22
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,642
What about food expiring
before it's supposed to?

23
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:36,844
Now that you mention it,

24
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,379
we've been having trouble
keeping milk fresh without..

25
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,814
Milk! Shit.

26
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:42,049
You didn't drink any of it,
did you?

27
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,917
No, should I have?

28
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,821
It's just that milk
makes them strong,

29
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:49,490
makes them excitable.

30
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,859
It does more than just a body good.

31
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,929
Did you get the items
Moses asked you to get?

32
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,898
Yes. Yes,
I picked them up last night.

33
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,533
Let me go and get them for you.

34
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,338
I have been finding crumbs everywhere.

35
00:05:04,372 --> 00:05:06,006
Could that mean anything?

36
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:18,386
This is bad place to put cookies.

37
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,930
Hm. This is too cheap,
it won't work.

38
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:32,533
Moses just said rum,
he didn't say expensive rum.

39
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,568
He didn't say cheap rum either.

40
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:37,371
Where's your liquor cabinet?

41
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:38,138
It's to the left.

42
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,440
No. No.

43
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:40,874
No, farther left.

44
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:43,877
Aha.

45
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,615
That was a gift!

46
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,617
Are you sure none of these
other bottles will do?

47
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,485
How do they even know the difference?

48
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,553
You said the Reading Room, right?

49
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:53,887
Yes!

50
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,613
They like sweets.

51
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:23,577
Can you hear that?

52
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:27,581
(Whispering)

53
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:31,619
They can smell the bourbon.

54
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,593
Ok, now I need your blood.

55
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:41,829
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

56
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:45,032
Why can't we use your blood?

57
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,067
Well, that'll cost you extra.

58
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,937
A lot extra.

59
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,612
A Swiss Army Knife?

60
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,180
Shouldn't it be a magic knife,

61
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,082
with a dragon skull
carved into it,

62
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:04,117
or some other iconography?

63
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,087
This knife has a can opener,
a screwdriver,

64
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,822
and performs ritual blood letting.

65
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:10,090
It also has a toothpick.

66
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,159
That sounds pretty magical to me.

67
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,994
I can draw my own blood.

68
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:08,942
Here. It dissipates with time,
but trust me..

69
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:10,944
It's in there.

70
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:12,980
And whatever you do,
don't ever open it.

71
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:14,682
Unless you want to cause
some trouble again.

72
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,950
And don't ever drink it.

73
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,953
You, you're not taking it with you.

74
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:22,856
No, it's yours, for you
to display as you please.

75
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,791
No. No, no, no, no.

76
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,292
My cleaning woman is
extremely superstitious.

77
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,094
She would never allow
this to be in our home.

78
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,328
She would quit cleaning,
the whole place would..

79
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,863
If you want me to take it..

80
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:30,764
My wife would never allow it.

81
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:31,965
It's going to cost you more.

82
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:32,966
Fine. Fine. Take it with you.

83
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,968
Whatever it costs, just
get it out of my house.

84
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:36,236
Fine.

85
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,109
What the hell was that anyway?

86
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,946
Oh, it'll be itemized on your bill.

87
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,003
Hi.
Matt?

88
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,371
Yeah, I just flew in.

89
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,140
We just got your package for
Blue in the mail.

90
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,908
I'll put her on after she
opens it.

91
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:18,211
Yeah, sure.
How's the birthday girl?

92
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:19,880
She's been asking about you.

93
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,348
We got your postcard from
Santa Fe.

94
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:24,151
They thought you said
you saw Santa Claus.

95
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,119
How's the weather?

96
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,455
Oh, the weather's fine.
It's hot as always.

97
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:29,923
They were predicting rain

98
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:31,291
Yay!
For us today,

99
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,425
but it turned out to be
nice for her party later.

100
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,895
Great. That's great.

101
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:35,896
How's the fish?

102
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,264
It's really big.

103
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,899
It was a nice thought, but

104
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:42,469
Charlie would rather
watch TV or play games.

105
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:45,973
I think he's going to be
more of an indoor kid.

106
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:47,174
Yay!

107
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,275
Blue...

108
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,045
No!

109
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,215
Blue, Uncle Matt's on the phone.

110
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,051
Hi Uncle Matt.
Say thank you

111
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,253
for the teddy bear.
Hi Blue, happy birthday.

112
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:03,190
Did you get the box of
styrofoam peanuts I sent you?

113
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,892
Say thank you!

114
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:08,095
Thank you for the teddy bear.
I really love it.

115
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:11,932
Oh, was there one of those in
the box too? Good.

116
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,500
Give me the phone.
Bye!

117
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,037
Hey Matt.

118
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:20,373
Charlie! Matt, I gotta go.

119
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:24,011
Charlie, what are you doing?

120
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:30,884
I mean, we'll probably
have a connecting flight

121
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,085
somewhere in Heathrow.

122
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,987
We should meet up for
dinner or something.

123
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:37,090
Hi.

124
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,326
Looks like I'm late for the party.

125
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:53,974
Sorry I'm late.
Family business to attend to.

126
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,943
Apparently they're not taking Visa

127
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:58,211
in Saudi Arabia these days.

128
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:01,982
Another client declined
to keep their souvenir

129
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,017
from the experience, I take it.

130
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:06,419
Either we're not charging
enough for its storage

131
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,222
or people just aren't as
sentimental as they used to be.

132
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:11,358
Only you would be morbid enough

133
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,994
to keep these things as decorations.

134
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:18,131
Besides, storage is our
most profitable service.

135
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,200
This one caused me enough trouble

136
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:21,969
that I'd like to hang onto it.

137
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:27,474
Have it sent back with Fussell.

138
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:28,876
Your trophy collection

139
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,277
is more trouble than it's worth.

140
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,915
Better that they be kept
safe in my disused house

141
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:37,384
than in some storage
facility where a

142
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,419
hapless maintenance worker
can come along

143
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,121
and have the drink of his life.

144
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,290
And yet you take your
caretaker to put them away,

145
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,226
despite the fact that you
won't tell him what's inside.

146
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,131
I hate it when they look at me.

147
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:55,335
Where's Baynes?
Baynes run into trouble?

148
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:59,306
No. Trouble ate him.

149
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,441
Most of him, at least.
We found the body.

150
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,443
We're shipping him back to
Akron tomorrow.

151
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:05,946
Moses, that'll cost an arm
and a leg.

152
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:06,813
You're awful.

153
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,282
I mean, it's expensive to
ship a body.

154
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:11,985
Especially if there's so
little of him left to ship.

155
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:16,924
And I mean it, you're an awful,
cheap bastard.

156
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,058
You wouldn't want to be sent

157
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:19,459
back to your family?

158
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,929
For God's sake Moses, when
I die, go ahead, cremate me.

159
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:24,031
Send me home in an envelope, ok?

160
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:26,366
I suppose we just tell the postman

161
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,968
it's a package of coffee?

162
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,337
Pepper. I hate coffee.

163
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,218
We recovered this with Baines' body.

164
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:47,120
You'll need it for the ritual.

165
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,229
You're not sounding very good.
You feel all right?

166
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:59,232
No worse than you look.

167
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:05,973
Yes, but I look a little worse
every year.

168
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,477
Maybe you should take some time,

169
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,379
go visit your girlfriend,
what's her name, Blue?

170
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,547
Blue's my niece, Moses.

171
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:19,086
Spend some money for once.
Take time.

172
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:22,189
You know better than most
you can't take it with you.

173
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:26,126
I'll take time when the
holidays come.

174
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,962
You don't look like
you'd last another week,

175
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:31,031
let alone five months.

176
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,434
The holidays.

177
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:38,738
Now if you'll excuse me,
your time is my money.

178
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,109
Don't forget to wear something warm.

179
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:26,786
Well, there's your problem.

180
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,189
He probably wanted
it back in his cave.

181
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,359
Or wherever you stole it from.

182
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:47,107
You're no Humble Bumble.

183
00:16:55,582 --> 00:17:00,587
This is for you.

184
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,143
Stop touching the radio.

185
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,179
When you drive, you'll get
to pick what we listen to.

186
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,248
When I drive, we get to
listen to listen to you

187
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:29,816
running your mouth,
which pretty much

188
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,085
drowns everything else out.

189
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,720
I'm sure you'll really miss hearing

190
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,855
one of the 20 classic rock
songs they play in a loop

191
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,824
because you really needed to
hear "Stairway"

192
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,492
just one more time.

193
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:41,328
You know what,
if someone didn't forget

194
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,496
which bag she packed the iPod in...

195
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,732
You know, it's too bad
you feel like tuning me out,

196
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,134
instead of speaking with me.

197
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,301
You won't be seeing as much
of me,

198
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:50,337
now that's I've got my own place.

199
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:53,406
Would you stop shoving that
in my face?

200
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,807
You know, you'd still
be living at home too,

201
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:57,410
if Uncle Matt left me the house.

202
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:58,811
Jealous?

203
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:00,680
Yeah. How could I not be?

204
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:03,516
Twenty years of wondering
what the hell happened to him,

205
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,752
and the last message
I get is a box

206
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,188
of reruns of "ALF" on VHS?

207
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:10,823
You loved "ALF."

208
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:13,260
You loved it so much.

209
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:17,264
And you got a house.
I mean, how fair is that?

210
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:19,432
You watched those shows
with him when we'd visit.

211
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,234
It's a sentimental gift.

212
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:25,838
I mean, who even has a VCR anymore?

213
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:28,441
The only place we'll be able
to watch them is at your house.

214
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:29,742
Your house.

215
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,744
Maybe I'll spend the
weekend reminiscing

216
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,480
about my '80s childhood.

217
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:36,849
And you get to clean up 20
years of disrepair and junk.

218
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:38,751
You know, it's so cute
when you get all sulky.

219
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,354
That's how I know
you'll really miss me.

220
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:56,803
What time are we supposed to meet,

221
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,905
uh, what's-his-face, the caretaker?

222
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:01,808
Mr. Fussell? We're early,
still got, like, half an hour.

223
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:09,416
I can't believe it's been 20
years since he disappeared.

224
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:12,919
Yeah, well, he was almost
always away on business anyway.

225
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:16,489
He hardly ever came home,
except for on holidays.

226
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:17,790
That's why it took people so long

227
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,859
to even file a missing
person's report.

228
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,929
He was always just,
out there somewhere.
bell tolls)

229
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,233
Missing episodes of "ALF."

230
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:28,801
Yeah, that's why he taped 'em.

231
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,370
Nowadays, I suppose he could
have just

232
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:32,839
watched them on his phone,
wherever he was working.

233
00:19:32,872 --> 00:19:35,508
That's true,
and there'd be no commercials.

234
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:36,909
Old commercials are fun!

235
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:38,778
That's the best part of old tapes!

236
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,448
There's plenty of ads on the Internet.

237
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:44,317
Sure, and in the future,
when they implant Wi-Fi

238
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,886
in your brain, you won't
need memories anymore either.

239
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,187
Ha ha.

240
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,457
Here's a set of keys for you.

241
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,392
You should find most things
in decent order.

242
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:00,827
Most things.

243
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:02,995
It's dusty and there's mail everywhere.

244
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,564
I ran out of places.

245
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,599
I don't know where to put
everything after 20 years.

246
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:07,867
Well, it'll be nice

247
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,935
to have someone in
the old house again.

248
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:11,003
And Mr. Fussell won't
have any excuses

249
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:12,839
to not help out and leave me.

250
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:17,043
I was up there yesterday
and turned on the gas.

251
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:19,446
The wiring is old up there,

252
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:22,915
and don't be surprised if
the electricity goes out.

253
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,485
You should check the hot
tub before you turn it on.

254
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:26,886
The hot tub!

255
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:28,888
I totally forgot he had one.
Sweet!

256
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:31,023
And be careful.

257
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:32,392
I set up mice traps
down in the basement.

258
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:33,960
The roof's still in good condition.

259
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:35,562
So's the television.

260
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:37,797
Mr. Fussell leaves me alone
often enough to check on that.

261
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,399
Grace, go see what
Toby's barking about.

262
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:45,538
If you need any help..
You can call a handyman.

263
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:46,873
He's done more than his fair share

264
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,441
of helping out around here.
Enough.

265
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:50,810
If Toby hops the fence,
you can go after him.

266
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:52,078
It's your turn.

267
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:54,841
Hey cool, Uncle Matt's hat!

268
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:55,975
What?

269
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,046
What are you doing?

270
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:05,117
Would you give me that!

271
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:13,926
You have to lean into it ...

272
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:16,629
like you mean it.

273
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:20,467
You want to try again?

274
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:40,920
Whoa.

275
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:42,889
Guess dear old Mrs. Fussell

276
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,991
wasn't the only thing
being neglected, huh?

277
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:51,898
Looks like the TV's pretty
well taken care of,

278
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,000
and the snacks.

279
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:57,036
Let's hope for that old guy's sake

280
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,205
that, uh,
those aren't 20 years old.

281
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:02,909
Whoa!

282
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:03,910
What?

283
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:04,911
Nuthin', just..

284
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:05,845
A mouse?

285
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:06,946
Nope, not a mouse.

286
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:07,880
Mr. Fussell..
I'll take care of it.

287
00:24:07,914 --> 00:24:09,048
Was talking about a mouse.

288
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:11,217
I'm aware.

289
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:17,223
What?

290
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:18,858
There's a mouse down there.
It's dead!

291
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:19,959
I'm not touching it.

292
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:21,594
I'll take care of it.
Yeah.

293
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,531
That's what you're here for.

294
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:26,866
Great.

295
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,201
Lucky me.

296
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:32,138
Water works.

297
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:34,874
Hm.
Wonder who's been paying for it?

298
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,177
Look at these bills.
Second notice.

299
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:42,081
Third notice.
Second final notice.

300
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:43,650
Absolutely fin..

301
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:46,919
I mean, do they even
do that anymore?

302
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:48,287
I think it's an old thing.

303
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,657
Yeah, probably before they
had collections agencies.

304
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,825
Probably pretty hard to repo water.

305
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:01,300
Ugh. Did you know that
coffee can grow mold?

306
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,170
Who knew? That's terrible.

307
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:07,273
Mmm. And you can clean that too.

308
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:08,875
Thanks.

309
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:22,989
Hope this isn't a support web.

310
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:42,541
Chair still works.

311
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:55,187
Blue Bear!

312
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:05,031
Aw, look who you found.

313
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:07,800
It's like no time has passed
at all,

314
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:09,602
from when we used to
stay here as kids.

315
00:26:09,636 --> 00:26:10,937
Yeah, you're right.

316
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,171
I mean, with no one
here to pass the time,

317
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:14,941
I guess time didn't even pass.

318
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:16,843
So I guess you can take the
bottom bunk,

319
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:19,311
and I'm gonna take the
master bedroom upstairs.

320
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:22,014
That was Uncle Matt's.

321
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:24,884
I think we should leave it alone,

322
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,318
at least for the time being.

323
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:28,955
Ok, fine.

324
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:30,322
Can I at least take
the room next door?

325
00:26:30,356 --> 00:26:32,091
Is that off-limits?

326
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,027
It's yours.

327
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:36,162
I just think I'm a little too old

328
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:38,064
to be sharing a bunk
bed with my sister.

329
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,899
Fine, it's yours.

330
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:00,967
Oh, do you remember this?

331
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:05,872
Hey, you want to go down to
the pond with me,

332
00:30:05,905 --> 00:30:07,273
see if we can catch anything?

333
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,474
You know that there

334
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:11,110
are never any fish in there, right?

335
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:15,147
Mom and Dad just sent us down
there to, uh, waste some time?

336
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:16,182
Ugh.

337
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:25,892
Why wouldn't they have
put a light switch

338
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:27,927
at the top of the stairs?

339
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,497
This basement always
gave me the creeps.

340
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:35,367
Oooooh, Charlie,
it's the furnace talking.

341
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:41,073
Found it.

342
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,311
You ok?

343
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:48,114
Come on.

344
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:49,982
The pinball machine!

345
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:57,023
Wonder if it still works.

346
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:02,128
Think it saved my high score?

347
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,970
Amazing that it saved that

348
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:12,371
after all these years.

349
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,061
Hm.

350
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:36,295
Ugh.

351
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,961
Oh man, this is awesome.

352
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,564
You gotta come...

353
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:14,700
Hey, what is that?

354
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,935
I think it's supposed to be liquor.

355
00:32:22,408 --> 00:32:25,011
Holy awesome.

356
00:32:25,044 --> 00:32:27,279
Uncle Matt must have been
some kind of bootlegger.

357
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,019
Hey.

358
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,760
Uh, wha..

359
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,295
What?

360
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:48,067
First one's for Uncle Matt.

361
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:50,369
There's plenty for
you to get loaded on

362
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:52,004
at the party tomorrow.

363
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:53,439
Let's finish up. Come on.

364
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:57,109
Damn straight.
Whole basement full of moonshine?

365
00:32:57,543 --> 00:32:59,111
This Fourth of July,
I'm going to celebrate

366
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:02,014
by becoming independent
from my pants.

367
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,084
It was right over there!

368
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:39,218
It followed me all the way home

369
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:40,819
and just stood outside my window,

370
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,489
staring, like it weren't
never gonna stop.

371
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,557
That was the time you tried
to have sex

372
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:47,226
in the graveyard, huh?

373
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:48,760
What happened to the girl?

374
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:51,097
Huh. She's all right.

375
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:54,266
Boy she was pissed!

376
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,368
She heard something but
didn't think it was worth

377
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:58,804
me jumping up and running away.

378
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:01,273
Well, I hate to be the bearer
of bad news,

379
00:34:01,307 --> 00:34:03,809
but people don't tend to
live long, fruitful lives

380
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:06,378
once they actually see a Black Shuck.

381
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:07,746
A Black..

382
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:08,847
Shuck.

383
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,549
Matches the description
of what you saw.

384
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:13,452
In the old days, there
was a superstition,

385
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:16,788
that the first person buried
in a new cemetery

386
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:20,426
was given the task of protecting
that cemetery from evil.

387
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,729
But to keep human souls off
guard duty,

388
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:25,497
churches started a new custom.

389
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:29,135
In the first grave of a new cemetery,

390
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:32,104
they would bury a black dog,

391
00:34:32,138 --> 00:34:34,440
usually a Lab or a Shepherd.

392
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:37,309
And they would bury this dog alive.

393
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:39,745
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
that's messed up, man.

394
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:41,480
This thing ain't no dog!

395
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:44,816
It was big, like a, like a
gator or a coyote or something.

396
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,286
They get that way after
being dead for a few centuries.

397
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:49,855
But once you've seen one,
you've only got three days

398
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:51,123
before you end up buried

399
00:34:51,157 --> 00:34:52,458
in the same cemetery that it guards.

400
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:55,261
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What do you mean, "seen"?

401
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:58,164
As in looked at, you know,
with your eyes.

402
00:34:58,197 --> 00:34:59,898
But I did that!

403
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,200
And tonight's your third night,

404
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:02,801
which is why I'm sure
you'll understand

405
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,737
you need cash up front
if we're to go further.

406
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,843
Ohhh, I don't like this.

407
00:35:11,877 --> 00:35:12,778
You don't have to.

408
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:14,780
When I hired you,
Moses didn't say nuthin'

409
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,882
about me havin' to play bait.

410
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:19,418
What are you doing?

411
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,353
I thought I made that clear.

412
00:35:21,387 --> 00:35:24,790
I can't look in its eyes,
or it'll come after me.

413
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:26,758
But you've already looked at it,

414
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,494
and you can't die twice.

415
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:31,397
What, why can't you just kill it?

416
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:35,834
Because it's already dead.

417
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,370
You did take physics in
high school, didn't you?

418
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:42,774
Look, just lead it down
the alley, onto the seal,

419
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:44,910
and I'll take care of the rest.

420
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:47,179
First..

421
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:48,847
you'll need some of this.

422
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,882
You're damn straight.

423
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:53,452
No, actually, not like that.
Oh.

424
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:56,255
He needs to be able to smell you.

425
00:36:50,476 --> 00:36:51,410
What?

426
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:06,525
Here boy.

427
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,861
Damn mutt.

428
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:16,602
Here boy.

429
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:21,840
Ugh, nice night for a walk.

430
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:24,776
Ooh! Least y'all ain't drivin'!

431
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:34,586
Damn mutt.

432
00:37:57,476 --> 00:38:00,312
Whoa, what's there?

433
00:38:00,346 --> 00:38:03,782
Matt! Matt! Matt!

434
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:06,352
Matt, do something!

435
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:08,354
Tell me when he's on the seal.

436
00:38:08,387 --> 00:38:10,021
Just, just do it, now!

437
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:11,823
Is he drinking the rum?

438
00:38:11,857 --> 00:38:14,993
Tell me when he's drinking
the rum.

439
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:18,330
It's tasting me!
Good.

440
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:47,393
Work, work, work.

441
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:50,562
Damn boxes.

442
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,398
Whew!

443
00:38:57,636 --> 00:38:58,970
Smile!

444
00:39:00,406 --> 00:39:01,873
I need to document this,
otherwise no one back home

445
00:39:01,907 --> 00:39:03,742
will ever believe you were helpful.

446
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:05,511
Ha ha. Now where do
you want me to put this.

447
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:06,412
This is getting heavy.

448
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:07,813
Hold on a minute.

449
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,080
I just want to make sure
you had your eyes open.

450
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,818
Looking good Chuck.

451
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,119
Ok, gimme that.

452
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:15,821
I don't know, I think we're going

453
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,155
to have to delete this one.

454
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,824
There's definitely

455
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,426
something wrong.

456
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:21,827
Don't delete that!

457
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:25,831
Hey, there is something there.

458
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:26,998
What is that?

459
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:28,434
I don't know, probably a lens flare,

460
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:30,569
or a reflection of the window.

461
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:32,871
No, it almost looks like some
kind of animal.

462
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:34,440
Yeah, sure it is.

463
00:39:34,473 --> 00:39:35,841
If you want to see things,
I don't know,

464
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,843
maybe look for Elvis or the
Virgin Mary in your soup,

465
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,812
but I am getting hungry,
and it is dinnertime.

466
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:09,040
Do you hear that?

467
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:12,844
Huh? Oh, that was me, sorry.

468
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:17,616
No, not that.
It sounded like a dog.

469
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:19,785
That's funny.

470
00:40:19,818 --> 00:40:22,087
Usually I'm the one who
blames it on the dog.

471
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:59,057
Could Mr. Fussell's
dog have gotten loose

472
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,592
and come over here?

473
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:01,860
How could he get inside

474
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:02,961
or upstairs without either of
us even know..

475
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:04,863
I hear it downstairs now.

476
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:14,573
Ugh.

477
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:23,915
There's nothing out on the porch.

478
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:25,183
There's nothing here either.

479
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,886
It definitely sounded
like a dog though, right?

480
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:43,869
Looks like you've settled
in for the evening.

481
00:41:43,902 --> 00:41:46,104
Mm-mm. I got a hot date,

482
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:48,239
with the pinball machine.

483
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:50,976
Sounds like more exercise than
you're used to.

484
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,110
Try not to hurt yourself.

485
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:53,178
I need you to help
put up decorations

486
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:54,980
in the morning before the parade.

487
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,715
Yeah yeah.

488
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:25,103
Son of a..

489
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,653
Hm.

490
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,200
Hm.

491
00:44:07,278 --> 00:44:09,347
Guess it can't get any worse.

492
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,926
Yeah sure it works now Charlie.
What the..

493
00:46:57,382 --> 00:46:59,150
Charlie?

494
00:47:01,452 --> 00:47:03,121
Damn.

495
00:47:15,934 --> 00:47:18,036
Whoa. Ugh.

496
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:48,133
Whoa.

497
00:48:51,229 --> 00:48:54,232
Toby?

498
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:56,534
Is that you boy?

499
00:48:56,567 --> 00:48:58,103
Did you sneak out of
Mr. Fussell's yard

500
00:48:58,136 --> 00:49:00,271
to see if we had any table scraps?

501
00:50:13,111 --> 00:50:14,245
Damn it, Charlie, not funny.

502
00:50:14,279 --> 00:50:16,214
How long were you out
here waiting for me?

503
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,186
That sounds more like bear
than dog.

504
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:23,788
Come on, we'd better get inside.

505
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,368
Did you drink this whole bottle?

506
00:50:37,835 --> 00:50:38,803
This stuff smells like you
could use it

507
00:50:38,836 --> 00:50:41,806
to de-clog a shower drain.

508
00:51:00,258 --> 00:51:01,426
Everything's locked.

509
00:51:01,459 --> 00:51:04,129
If it is a bear, it won't be
poking its nose around in here.

510
00:51:10,535 --> 00:51:12,403
I really wish you would think
before you drank so much.

511
00:51:12,437 --> 00:51:14,071
You need water.

512
00:51:14,439 --> 00:51:16,841
I don't want you to be
hung over in the morning.

513
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:19,877
What the hell's gotten into
you Charlie?

514
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,379
Stop being an asshole.

515
00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:23,414
They'll be no more drinking

516
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:24,349
for you at the party tomorrow.

517
00:51:31,456 --> 00:51:32,557
Ohhh.

518
00:51:40,165 --> 00:51:43,834
Hey! Douchebag!

519
00:51:43,868 --> 00:51:46,804
Enjoy your milk. It'll be the
last time you get so drunk

520
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:50,275
you forget you're lactose intolerant.

521
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,255
Ugh, oh.

522
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:06,857
Oh, uh.

523
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:13,130
Ugh.

524
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,362
Grace, go check on the dog.

525
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:45,763
What's a matter with you?

526
00:52:45,796 --> 00:52:46,931
You're sitting right there,
you can't go check on the dog?

527
00:52:46,964 --> 00:52:49,534
Oh, jeez. Just go check on him.

528
00:52:49,567 --> 00:52:51,836
I check everything myself.

529
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:04,782
Toby.

530
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:06,884
Toby. Where are you, boy?

531
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:08,953
Come here Toby, come.

532
00:53:14,825 --> 00:53:16,527
Whoa.

533
00:53:16,561 --> 00:53:18,329
Grace, you ok?

534
00:53:56,501 --> 00:53:59,904
(Murmurs)

535
00:54:26,431 --> 00:54:27,965
Blue...

536
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:33,371
Charlie?

537
00:54:47,485 --> 00:54:49,053
DId you call me?

538
00:54:52,923 --> 00:54:54,058
Ugh.

539
00:54:57,862 --> 00:54:58,929
Ugh.

540
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:03,334
Ugh.

541
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,306
Ugh.

542
00:55:11,075 --> 00:55:12,042
Ugh.

543
00:57:13,898 --> 00:57:15,900
What are all the Xs for?

544
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:17,868
Oh, the number of Xs is relative

545
00:57:17,902 --> 00:57:20,070
to how dangerous the contents are.

546
00:57:21,806 --> 00:57:22,473
I think you should probably

547
00:57:22,507 --> 00:57:23,173
take it with you.

548
00:57:23,207 --> 00:57:24,975
It'll cost extra.

549
00:57:29,547 --> 00:57:31,782
Well all right, may-maybe we
can work something out, uh..

550
00:57:31,816 --> 00:57:33,050
You're the best.

551
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:35,553
Wait, I have something for
you, also.

552
00:57:35,586 --> 00:57:36,654
Yeah?

553
00:57:41,892 --> 00:57:43,060
Oh, thank you.

554
00:57:43,093 --> 00:57:45,863
That's exactly what I
expected you to give me.

555
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:46,931
Great.

556
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,857
What is it?

557
00:58:13,858 --> 00:58:15,225
Well..

558
00:58:15,259 --> 00:58:18,829
it has lots of names, actually.

559
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:21,198
People give lots of names to hungry,

560
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:23,868
evil things that hide in dark corners

561
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:26,003
and wait for children.

562
00:58:26,571 --> 00:58:31,008
Bloody bones, a Der Schwarze,
a Duende.

563
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:32,977
What?

564
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,912
A damn bogeyman.

565
00:58:34,945 --> 00:58:36,914
Jesus.

566
00:58:37,114 --> 00:58:38,916
People invoke all kinds of names

567
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:41,151
to get their children to behave.

568
00:58:46,624 --> 00:58:48,092
Some of those names are real,

569
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:50,595
and this one certainly
would've eaten your son,

570
00:58:50,628 --> 00:58:52,563
if you hadn't called.

571
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:56,901
Why don't you have a seat?

572
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:02,139
Are you ok?

573
00:59:02,172 --> 00:59:04,809
Wait right here,
I'll get you some water.

574
00:59:22,627 --> 00:59:24,929
Oh.

575
00:59:25,663 --> 00:59:26,864
What the...

576
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:30,100
Where...

577
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:55,693
Oh, thank goodness.

578
01:00:28,926 --> 01:00:31,896
Morning.
Thanks for making coffee.

579
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:34,064
There'd have been none
if I waited for youu.

580
01:00:37,902 --> 01:00:39,236
Hey, how did I end up on the floor

581
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:40,971
of your room last night?

582
01:00:41,005 --> 01:00:42,372
I don't remember a thing.

583
01:00:42,406 --> 01:00:45,042
I bet you don't.

584
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:48,012
Yeah, I should probably
lay off that moonshine.

585
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,414
At least until you
learn some self-control.

586
01:00:50,447 --> 01:00:51,882
Just because you open a bottle,

587
01:00:51,916 --> 01:00:53,083
doesn't mean you have to
finish it.

588
01:00:53,117 --> 01:00:54,251
I drank a whole bottle!

589
01:00:54,284 --> 01:00:56,020
And turned into a total dick.

590
01:00:56,053 --> 01:00:57,221
Oh.

591
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:00,691
Blue, I'm so sorry.

592
01:01:01,191 --> 01:01:02,927
What did I do?

593
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:05,329
I don't know.

594
01:01:05,362 --> 01:01:07,297
It's like you're a different
person when you drink.

595
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:09,266
Just forget about it.

596
01:01:11,969 --> 01:01:14,004
Finish putting up the decorations.

597
01:01:14,038 --> 01:01:16,106
I'm going to shower before
the parade.

598
01:01:31,956 --> 01:01:34,024
Mr. Fussell? Mrs. Fussell?

599
01:01:34,058 --> 01:01:35,459
It's Blue.

600
01:01:35,492 --> 01:01:37,027
Blue Moon, from up the hill.

601
01:01:37,061 --> 01:01:38,996
I think your dog may have

602
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:41,098
gotten into our yard last night.

603
01:01:42,933 --> 01:01:45,736
Just thought someone should know.

604
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:10,955
Truce?

605
01:03:13,023 --> 01:03:14,859
It's a holiday.

606
01:03:14,892 --> 01:03:16,393
Come on, it's fun.
Would you just take it?

607
01:03:16,426 --> 01:03:17,427
Ok.

608
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:18,262
It's a pinwheel!

609
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:19,263
It's your favorite.

610
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:20,430
Thank you.

611
01:03:20,464 --> 01:03:23,200
About last night.
Just, try to let it go.

612
01:03:23,233 --> 01:03:25,002
It was probably just a power surge

613
01:03:25,035 --> 01:03:27,404
or a malfunction with the
fuse box or something.

614
01:03:27,437 --> 01:03:28,939
There was a light!

615
01:03:28,973 --> 01:03:30,875
Yes. Televisions have lights?

616
01:03:30,908 --> 01:03:32,376
You remember,
Mr. Fussell said there was

617
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:34,979
something wrong with the electricity.

618
01:03:35,012 --> 01:03:37,882
I don't know.

619
01:03:37,915 --> 01:03:39,984
You were already on edge from me,

620
01:03:40,017 --> 01:03:43,053
and I apologized, and the dog ...

621
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:45,322
the bear?

622
01:03:46,523 --> 01:03:47,424
I want you to look at it
before you leave.

623
01:03:47,457 --> 01:03:49,159
Ok, fine, I'll look at it.

624
01:03:49,193 --> 01:03:50,895
You know I'm no electrician.

625
01:03:50,928 --> 01:03:53,530
Or anything handy. I'll try.

626
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:55,365
Do you think we'll be able to
see the fireworks

627
01:03:55,399 --> 01:03:57,167
in the bay from the house tonight?

628
01:03:57,201 --> 01:03:59,536
Nah, probably not.
But you know what we could do.

629
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:01,238
We could all go down to the
beach on our side of the bay.

630
01:04:01,271 --> 01:04:03,240
At least we'd have some
privacy there.

631
01:04:17,955 --> 01:04:20,991
Here, here, here.
Charlie, here.

632
01:04:29,499 --> 01:04:33,037
Charlie, what's in these
cases over here by the cooler?

633
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:34,371
It's some kind of liquor, man.

634
01:04:34,404 --> 01:04:36,406
I mean, I think my uncle
was some kind of moonshiner.

635
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,175
I'd be careful drinking that.

636
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:39,977
Charlie turned into
a complete asshat

637
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:41,345
yesterday after drinking some.

638
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:44,048
It doesn't take much, does it?

639
01:04:58,262 --> 01:04:59,529
Hey, Toby!

640
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:02,099
Hey Blue. I told you Toby got loose.

641
01:05:02,132 --> 01:05:05,936
(Murmuring)

642
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:13,944
And this is the loft.

643
01:05:13,978 --> 01:05:16,981
Got your haunted TV, a futon.

644
01:05:17,014 --> 01:05:18,282
Nice.

645
01:05:18,315 --> 01:05:19,349
A pretty chill place.

646
01:05:19,383 --> 01:05:20,317
Cool.

647
01:05:21,018 --> 01:05:22,419
That was Uncle Matt's bedroom.

648
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:24,354
I don't know what I'm
going to use it for yet.

649
01:05:24,388 --> 01:05:25,489
Cool.

650
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,360
And that's the tour.

651
01:05:32,029 --> 01:05:35,966
(Murmuring)

652
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,268
Linda. You interested?

653
01:05:38,302 --> 01:05:40,137
Sure, what the hell, right?

654
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:41,571
Nice!

655
01:05:56,053 --> 01:05:56,987
Here's two.

656
01:05:57,021 --> 01:05:58,022
Sweet.

657
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:05,429
Ugh, that smells disgusting.

658
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:07,131
Maybe I'll just have a beer.

659
01:06:07,164 --> 01:06:08,365
Ugh!

660
01:06:08,398 --> 01:06:10,400
Smells like my grandfather.

661
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:15,305
So, uh, Charlie was telling me

662
01:06:15,339 --> 01:06:19,743
that he has a pinball machine,
in the basement?

663
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:25,515
And you thought that would
entice me downstairs?

664
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:32,322
Come on, pinball wizard.
Let's see those flipping fingers.

665
01:06:32,356 --> 01:06:33,257
Mmm.

666
01:06:59,116 --> 01:07:00,084
Burger or dog?

667
01:07:00,117 --> 01:07:01,251
Burger.

668
01:07:01,718 --> 01:07:03,453
Burger with cheese.

669
01:07:03,487 --> 01:07:04,354
Hot dog it is.

670
01:07:04,388 --> 01:07:05,455
No I want a burger.

671
01:07:05,489 --> 01:07:06,390
Too bad.

672
01:07:06,423 --> 01:07:08,358
I want a burger, with cheese.

673
01:07:08,392 --> 01:07:09,759
I want to make her a burger,

674
01:07:09,793 --> 01:07:11,161
and I want to make you a hot dog.

675
01:07:11,195 --> 01:07:13,230
Um, I'm going to go to the bathroom.

676
01:07:13,263 --> 01:07:15,299
I know you know how to make burgers.

677
01:07:15,332 --> 01:07:16,700
Mm, I don't know how to make burgers.

678
01:07:16,733 --> 01:07:17,801
I don't even know what a
burger is.

679
01:07:17,834 --> 01:07:19,236
Burger, cheese, bun.

680
01:07:59,476 --> 01:08:02,779
Hm.

681
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:47,757
What an ugly bear.

682
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:49,859
Mah!

683
01:09:21,525 --> 01:09:24,761
Oh, look at all this stuff here.

684
01:09:24,794 --> 01:09:27,231
Come on. I thought we were
going to play pinball.

685
01:09:29,233 --> 01:09:30,367
Damn it! Ugh.

686
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,501
It's ok..

687
01:09:31,535 --> 01:09:32,436
It's not like it's going to stain

688
01:09:32,469 --> 01:09:34,438
the basement floor or anything.

689
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:37,441
Yeah but.

690
01:09:37,474 --> 01:09:40,777
Come on.

691
01:10:46,843 --> 01:10:47,977
Ah!
What?

692
01:10:48,011 --> 01:10:51,381
What, what-what is it? What?
A mouse.

693
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:53,483
Yeah, but, so what?

694
01:10:53,517 --> 01:10:55,819
Get rid of it.
Where?

695
01:10:55,852 --> 01:10:58,855
Someplace where I'm not
fooling around with you.

696
01:10:58,888 --> 01:11:00,857
Which is going to be
everywhere in a minute.

697
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:02,826
Fine...

698
01:11:17,441 --> 01:11:18,475
Ugh.

699
01:11:18,508 --> 01:11:20,076
Nothing here.

700
01:11:26,983 --> 01:11:30,520
Who wants overcooked meat?

701
01:11:30,554 --> 01:11:32,956
Ugh, gimme that.
Wait.

702
01:11:37,594 --> 01:11:38,928
Fair enough.

703
01:12:02,852 --> 01:12:04,788
Wait, I have to go to the bathroom.

704
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:06,390
Sorry. I'll be right back.

705
01:12:06,423 --> 01:12:08,892
Yeah, hurry up.
I will.

706
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:26,810
So, there's a pinball
machine in the basement.

707
01:12:26,843 --> 01:12:28,011
I don't think so.

708
01:12:28,044 --> 01:12:29,946
But, but I'm a pinball wizard.

709
01:12:29,979 --> 01:12:31,080
Uh, no.

710
01:12:38,121 --> 01:12:39,856
Ugh.

711
01:12:42,592 --> 01:12:44,828
Mmm.

712
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:48,097
(Murmuring)

713
01:12:48,965 --> 01:12:50,867
Now I gotta change.

714
01:12:55,539 --> 01:12:58,608
Your friend Dana?
Asleep in my bed for some reason?

715
01:12:58,642 --> 01:13:00,977
She was sitting in the sun
all afternoon drinking.

716
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:02,912
That could wipe anybody out.

717
01:13:02,946 --> 01:13:04,448
It would have been nice
if she asked permission

718
01:13:04,481 --> 01:13:06,416
before she just crawled right in.

719
01:13:06,450 --> 01:13:09,118
It's my bed! It's my house,
I really don't think

720
01:13:09,152 --> 01:13:10,987
you need to be getting
possessive over it.

721
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:12,922
Right, everything here is yours.

722
01:13:12,956 --> 01:13:14,458
That's right.

723
01:13:14,491 --> 01:13:15,859
And that bed was where
Mom and Dad slept anyway.

724
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:17,527
Your bed was the top bunk,

725
01:13:17,561 --> 01:13:18,862
and the only thing keeping
you from it

726
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:20,497
is a pile of junk mail.

727
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:23,166
Feel free to clean it off if
you suddenly need to lie down.

728
01:13:24,033 --> 01:13:25,401
Ooh.

729
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:39,983
Oh, what'd you do, fall asleep?

730
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:44,621
I'll wake you up.
Tickle, tickle.

731
01:13:46,556 --> 01:13:48,492
What are you doing?

732
01:13:57,901 --> 01:13:59,536
Hey. Hey, where are you guys going?

733
01:14:58,094 --> 01:15:01,064
Hey Blue. When are the
fireworks gonna start?

734
01:15:01,097 --> 01:15:02,799
Uh, it's getting dark now.

735
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:03,867
We should probably head down
to the beach

736
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,101
if we wanna get there in time.

737
01:15:05,134 --> 01:15:06,603
You know.

738
01:15:07,904 --> 01:15:10,073
It's gettin' kind of cold

739
01:15:10,106 --> 01:15:11,841
for Fourth of July.
Yeah.

740
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:13,543
Maybe I'll get a jacket.

741
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:16,846
Look, please don't say anything.

742
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:19,015
Blue is already freaked
out from last night.

743
01:15:19,048 --> 01:15:21,184
Just keep this on the
down-low, all right?

744
01:15:21,217 --> 01:15:23,086
You guys, just relax, trust me?

745
01:15:24,621 --> 01:15:25,922
Have a little drink,

746
01:15:25,955 --> 01:15:27,290
it'll be ok.
Hey, we were going

747
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:29,125
to take those down to the..
Shut up, Blue's friend.

748
01:15:29,158 --> 01:15:31,561
Just have a drink,
it'll all be fine.

749
01:15:31,595 --> 01:15:33,597
You didn't even see anything.

750
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:34,831
I know what I saw.

751
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:36,332
You said you didn't
even see a thing!

752
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:39,669
Blue, can we take the
bottles down to the beach?

753
01:15:40,303 --> 01:15:42,872
Yeah sure, knock yourselves out.

754
01:15:43,072 --> 01:15:44,874
You know what? Fine.

755
01:15:48,645 --> 01:15:51,214
(Murmur)

756
01:15:51,247 --> 01:15:54,217
Here we go!

757
01:16:01,858 --> 01:16:05,328
(Murmur)

758
01:16:32,956 --> 01:16:34,858
Race you down to the beach!

759
01:16:34,891 --> 01:16:36,960
It's getting kind of chilly.

760
01:16:38,194 --> 01:16:39,996
Maybe we should bring some jackets.

761
01:16:49,973 --> 01:16:51,875
Hey. We're all headin'
down to the beach. You ready?

762
01:16:51,908 --> 01:16:53,677
Nah, you guys go ahead.

763
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:55,011
Not really feeling up to it.

764
01:16:55,044 --> 01:16:56,946
Why you being such a douche
this weekend?

765
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:57,881
You can't just come
out on the beach

766
01:16:57,914 --> 01:16:59,348
and enjoy the fireworks
with the rest of us?

767
01:16:59,382 --> 01:17:01,084
You know, they're your friends,
not mine.

768
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:02,285
You're my friend too.

769
01:17:02,318 --> 01:17:03,820
I'm your brother.

770
01:17:03,853 --> 01:17:05,154
Exactly. We can see each other

771
01:17:05,188 --> 01:17:07,090
only when obligated
to by family stuff

772
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:09,158
and not be bothered with
the rest of the year?

773
01:17:09,192 --> 01:17:10,960
But that's not how we
are. We're friends.

774
01:17:10,994 --> 01:17:13,262
We do things together.

775
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:16,933
Are we? Or am I just here
to help you move your crap?

776
01:17:20,904 --> 01:17:22,071
Ugh.

777
01:17:22,105 --> 01:17:23,840
I can't believe you!
You can't even accept

778
01:17:23,873 --> 01:17:25,875
when someone is trying
to be nice to you.

779
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:38,421
What the ...

780
01:18:07,884 --> 01:18:09,953
I don't have anything else to
say to you.

781
01:18:09,986 --> 01:18:11,888
Just leave, go home.

782
01:18:11,921 --> 01:18:13,289
Blue..

783
01:18:13,322 --> 01:18:16,192
really sorry about the way
I've been acting all weekend.

784
01:18:16,225 --> 01:18:20,229
No you're not.

785
01:18:20,263 --> 01:18:22,298
If you didn't want to come,
you shouldn't have come.

786
01:18:22,331 --> 01:18:25,001
I thought you'd be excited
for me.

787
01:18:27,937 --> 01:18:29,906
Look. It's pretty obvious
I'm jealous of you.

788
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:32,909
Getting your own place?

789
01:18:32,942 --> 01:18:34,878
And I get to be one of those
guys, you know?

790
01:18:34,911 --> 01:18:38,347
Almost 30 and still living
at home with mom and dad.

791
01:18:43,486 --> 01:18:45,321
And you're absolutely right.

792
01:18:45,354 --> 01:18:48,324
I mean, we're not just related.

793
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:55,865
You're my best friend.

794
01:18:55,899 --> 01:18:58,334
And I want to you to have
fun and be successful here.

795
01:19:02,872 --> 01:19:05,074
I'm sorry if I haven't
been supportive enough.

796
01:19:06,976 --> 01:19:08,411
What the hell?

797
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:12,882
Oh! Oh!

798
01:19:24,861 --> 01:19:26,930
(Muttering)

799
01:19:58,027 --> 01:19:59,328
Charlie?

800
01:20:47,076 --> 01:20:51,114
(Muttering)

801
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:57,020
(Muttering)

802
01:20:58,988 --> 01:21:00,924
Hm.

803
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:02,191
Ah.

804
01:21:03,993 --> 01:21:04,493
Hm.

805
01:21:30,086 --> 01:21:32,255
What is this?

806
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:39,528
Mail for me? From 1993?

807
01:21:53,442 --> 01:21:55,111
Dear Blue.

808
01:21:55,144 --> 01:21:56,379
Enclosed in this package,

809
01:21:56,412 --> 01:22:01,250
please find the remains
of one Matthew Moon,

810
01:22:01,284 --> 01:22:03,987
delivered in accordance
with his final wishes.

811
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:06,255
For over a decade, I had
the pleasure of employing

812
01:22:06,289 --> 01:22:08,191
this peculiar and efficient man

813
01:22:08,224 --> 01:22:10,326
who claimed to be your uncle.

814
01:22:10,359 --> 01:22:13,262
Unfortunately, our relationship
rarely went beyond business.

815
01:22:13,296 --> 01:22:15,999
In fact, all I really knew
about his personal life

816
01:22:16,032 --> 01:22:18,301
is your name and his home address,

817
01:22:18,334 --> 01:22:21,304
where I shipped a great deal
of usual cargo on his behalf.

818
01:22:21,337 --> 01:22:23,973
Moses? Bagg?

819
01:22:24,007 --> 01:22:25,374
I feel compelled to warn you.

820
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:27,443
Do not open any liquor
bottles you find

821
01:22:27,476 --> 01:22:28,978
among Matt's possessions.

822
01:22:29,012 --> 01:22:30,046
And never

823
01:22:30,079 --> 01:22:31,447
let anyone drink from them..

824
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:32,982
Oh my God.
They're cursed.

825
01:22:33,016 --> 01:22:33,482
The bottles!

826
01:23:09,418 --> 01:23:14,423
(Murmuring)

827
01:23:55,431 --> 01:24:00,203
(Murmuring)

828
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:32,168
(Murmurs)

829
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:41,577
Don't! O-open the bottles!

830
01:24:42,445 --> 01:24:44,147
Don't..
There's Blue!

831
01:24:46,315 --> 01:24:48,517
The bottles!

832
01:26:16,272 --> 01:26:19,808
(Murmuring)
