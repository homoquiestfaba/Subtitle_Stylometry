1
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,659
<i>Just when you think it's all over,</i>

2
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:38,204
<i>something unspeakable
comes after you and your family,</i>

3
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,124
<i>murders your sister Jenny in cold blood,</i>

4
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,501
<i>and disappears into thin air.</i>

5
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,881
<i>But a clue left behind leads us here,</i>

6
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,675
<i>to this club in Bangkok.</i>

7
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:56,431
<i>And that's why
we still need the Wu Assassin.</i>

8
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,516
<i> What's a Wu Assassin?</i>

9
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,352
<i>All right. So about a year ago,</i>

10
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,397
my friends and I
were living it up in San Francisco.

11
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,858
Uh, my sister, Jenny, and I,
we ran this restaurant,

12
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,861
and, um, my boy Lu Xin, he ran cars,

13
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,530
until she showed up.

14
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:16,826
A 10,000-year-old warrior spirit
brought back to Earth.

15
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,954
And then she gave her powers to Kai,
my best friend.

16
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,582
And then he became
the last Wu Assassin. Whatever.

17
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,250
What, like The Avengers?

18
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,752
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

19
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,670
- But Asian.
- Hmm.

20
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,006
Actually, no. More like
that show from the '70s.

21
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,092
Kai and Lu Xin are the Angels.

22
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:33,968
I'm like Charlie.

23
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,752
So what kind of mission?

24
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,381
Um, it's a supernatural one.

25
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,007
Sounds dangerous.

26
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,801
It's what we do.

27
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,825
- You seeing this?
- You know why we're here.

28
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,954
So your friend Kai…

29
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,747
- What about him?
- This Wu Assassin.

30
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,542
He's got to have
some kind of powers, right?

31
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,044
<i>He's empowered</i>
<i>by this thing called the Dao.</i>

32
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:54,424
<i>He's faster and stronger than any man.
He calls himself Death's Instrument.</i>

33
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,800
And your other friend?

34
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,344
Oh no, he's just
really good at kicking ass.

35
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,433
So why aren't you with them?

36
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,686
This seems more dangerous.

37
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,778
Do you want to continue your story
somewhere else?

38
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,988
Hell, yeah.

39
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,157
What about your friends?

40
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,200
They'll be fine.

41
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,285
I think.

42
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,206
Ah!

43
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,335
Ah!

44
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,843
I fucking love Thailand.

45
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:52,482
Why Bangkok? I mean, what's here?

46
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,067
Answers.

47
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,652
I, uh,

48
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:59,030
traced this material back to Thailand.

49
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:01,866
It's from an ancient, old piece of stone.

50
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,790
Kai! Up there! He's turning them.

51
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,552
Jiangshi.

52
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,054
Chi vampire.

53
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,394
What's so special about this?

54
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,522
<i> I found it in my dead sister's hand.</i>

55
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:37,652
<i>Kai, Lu Xin, and I
came back to my family restaurant,</i>

56
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:41,489
and she was just there,
dead on the ground.

57
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,659
Well, here's to your sister.

58
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,956
You want to know a secret?

59
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,207
Sure.

60
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,752
Come here.

61
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,089
I don't drink anymore.

62
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,050
This will turn you into
a Jiangshi, won't it?

63
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,057
I just want to talk.

64
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,311
Your powers don't work on me.

65
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,784
Who killed Jenny?

66
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,079
Who killed my sister?

67
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,842
Kai!

68
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,387
- He's not talking!
- Ah!

69
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,523
Ah!

70
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,664
Assassin's strike.

71
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,760
That's not what I was thinking at all.

72
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:34,519
Yo. Hey, hey! What is this?
Yo! Press the start button, man.

73
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,895
This isn't me.

74
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,107
It's me. I need your help.

75
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:40,983
You? Who are you?

76
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,319
No,
I'm speaking through them.

77
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,864
I can't hold it for long.

78
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,534
It's not safe
to put myself out here like this.

79
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,202
What do you want?

80
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:52,912
Not here.

81
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,791
8:00 a.m.
Silom Temple archaeological dig site.

82
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,168
We have much to discuss, Wu Assassin.

83
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,173
I am never coming
to a club with you ever again.

84
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,008
- Who was that?
- We should call Tommy.

85
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,472
Stop the van!

86
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,066
Yeah.

87
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,526
She didn't know anything.

88
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,695
What about your Jiangshi?

89
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,906
I guess we finally have a lead.

90
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,086
The archaeological site
is owned by this biotech billionaire.

91
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,089
Not much else on him,
but he owns that building.

92
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,720
So, uh, we're just
going to roll onto his turf?

93
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,389
If it gets us closer to Jenny's killer,
that's all that matters.

94
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,766
Looks shady as fuck.

95
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,985
It should be up on the right.

96
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,956
Guessing he's not the valet.

97
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,483
<i> Since founding his firm</i>
<i>in 1999,</i>

98
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,236
<i>William Pan has formed
collaboration agreements</i>

99
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,404
<i>with the world's largest companies.</i>

100
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,201
<i>Providing scientists
the opportunity and resources</i>

101
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:58,412
<i>to tackle humankind's
most perplexing problems.</i>

102
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,542
<i>All in service of William's unique vision.</i>

103
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,710
<i>One people,</i>

104
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,088
<i>one world,</i>

105
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,423
<i>one planet.</i>

106
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,136
<i>We're not just looking to the future…</i>

107
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,015
<i>We're looking to shape it.</i>

108
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,727
Thank you for coming.

109
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,565
I know my message was unorthodox.

110
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:29,986
I apologize for not meeting you in person.
Communicating like that was difficult.

111
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,407
Dr. William Pan.

112
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,706
Do you know the story of Pan Gu?

113
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,749
Yeah, we do.

114
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,961
The first man to shape the universe
from the great nothingness

115
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,879
and made the heavens,
the Earth, and the seas.

116
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,756
We all went to Chinese school.

117
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,925
Chinese school didn't teach you
what happened to Pan Gu

118
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,927
after he became a god.

119
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,597
<i>He went mad with power.</i>

120
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,057
Threatened to remake the world
in his own image.

121
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:01,601
But the Dao,

122
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,645
in its infinite celestial wisdom,

123
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:09,191
called upon the first Wu Assassin
to strike down that first man.

124
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,445
<i>Yin and yang. Chaos and order.</i>

125
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,697
<i>These spirits have clashed for millennia.</i>

126
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,949
I'm not the first vessel.

127
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,368
But thanks to you,

128
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,120
I am the last.

129
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,248
And with the world left unbalanced,

130
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,293
chaos and I can finally complete
our unending war.

131
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,295
I was attacked.

132
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,130
Barely made it out alive.

133
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,466
And that's why
I've retreated here for safety,

134
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,926
while my twin continues to spread chaos.

135
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,303
Who is he?

136
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,346
She.

137
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,722
Yin and yang.

138
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,643
<i>You might have heard of her. Ku An Qi.</i>

139
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,728
Queen of the Bangkok underworld.

140
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:49,690
She's going global.
Taking out any threats to her.

141
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,068
Consuming Chi to build her power.

142
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,404
The Shaolin in China.
The Druids in Ireland.

143
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,742
And last month, she went to San Francisco.

144
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,495
Ku An Qi was looking for you,

145
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,789
but your friend intervened.

146
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,256
Jenny.

147
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,846
She fought valiantly.

148
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,185
But Ku cannot be stopped.

149
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,146
She will continue her rampage
if left unchecked.

150
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,107
How do you know all this?

151
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,442
<i> Because Ku and I are connected.</i>

152
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,028
That is why I must be careful.

153
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,198
If I open myself up to her,

154
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,283
she will come.

155
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,494
Follow me.

156
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,678
This whole thing could be bullshit.

157
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,641
In the fight,
your sister took something of Ku's,

158
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,892
a talisman.

159
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,769
I have the other half.

160
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,647
I assume you have hers.

161
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,898
What's it matter to you?

162
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,567
It's a piece of our Essence.

163
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,902
- She'll try to get it back.
- Good. Send her my way.

164
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,113
In two days' time, my worse half

165
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,699
is meeting the heads of the Five Triads
at the Vie Hotel,

166
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,701
solidifying her power base.

167
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,496
Cameras everywhere, no weapons allowed.

168
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,583
- There's no honor in guns.
- And won't she know what you're up to?

169
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,960
I'm doing my best
to shield my thoughts from her.

170
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:36,172
My powers extend to the mind,

171
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,799
while hers are focused on the body.

172
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,553
Ah…

173
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:45,389
A kidnapping mission in broad daylight.

174
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,808
Hotel security,

175
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:51,395
the five bosses of the Triads,
their whole crews.

176
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,354
You know what?

177
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,731
I got a better idea.

178
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:57,109
Why don't you do the mind control thing
and send an army after them?

179
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,819
I can't control an army.

180
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,656
I can reach out, communicate,
hold a thought for a minute.

181
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,075
But that is the extent of my powers now.

182
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,455
Well, it seems like you got
all the answers, but the answers.

183
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,211
We're in.

184
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,133
When you subdue Ku,
you bring her to me with the talisman,

185
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,760
and I'll take care of the rest.

186
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:23,677
No.

187
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,471
You said the Dao is broken.

188
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,764
Yes.

189
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,559
But you and I together,
maybe we can restore it.

190
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,520
Or we let it be broken.

191
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,814
And I kill her.

192
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,161
The hotel, it's a death trap.

193
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,123
Yeah, but it's the person, demigod,
whatever, who murdered Jenny.

194
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,335
Yes, I understand that,
which is why we need to be smart about it.

195
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,629
- Look at the pieces in front of us.
- This isn't a game.

196
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,966
Actually, it is a game.
Everything is a game, Tommy.

197
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,427
We have the perfect opportunity right now.
We should take advantage of it.

198
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,972
If you have a death wish
because of your sister, don't drag me...

199
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,057
You act like
you don't care about Jenny at all!

200
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,143
- That's the game. No one's safe.
- Ah, fuck you, man.

201
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,021
- Yeah, fuck you too.
- Guys! Calm down.

202
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:17,731
I'm calm!

203
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:22,444
Ku An Qi wants the Wu Assassin.
I'll give her the Wu Assassin. Myself.

204
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,238
We're going together.

205
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,032
- No.
- It might not be the smartest choice,

206
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,243
but, look,
this is the only opportunity we have.

207
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:32,371
Fuck that. No way. I'll do this one alone.

208
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,043
You know what your problem is, Kai?

209
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,880
You think because you have powers,
you're better than us.

210
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,215
Like we're just
some kind of fucking burden.

211
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,357
Lu Xin is calling his contact.

212
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,027
Can he get a rocket launcher
to take Ku down?

213
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,405
You never know, with magic.

214
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,702
But I guess this worked.

215
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,581
Let me show you something.

216
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,045
Keep this finger loose.

217
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,339
It'll make it easier.

218
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,552
Try that.

219
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,727
I'm coming. I don't care what you say.

220
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,272
I have to go. Okay?

221
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,401
Look, Tommy.

222
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,571
You go angry, you get yourself killed.

223
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,741
That's… that's not how you fight.

224
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,830
You got to understand, though, man.

225
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,624
It's the only thing I have.

226
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,502
Anger.

227
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,634
Sorry to break up
the tanning session, boys.

228
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,928
Bad news.

229
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,472
The dude who outfitted us
for the Jiangshi mission blocked me.

230
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,182
Too much heat at the club.

231
00:16:58,726 --> 00:16:59,727
Anyone else?

232
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,521
I mean, as soon as they hear
we're going after Ku An Qi,

233
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,939
they lose my number fast.

234
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,109
I might know someone crazy enough to help.

235
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,112
What? Since when
did you get a Bangkok hookup?

236
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,071
I said "might."

237
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:12,906
I'll hit her up.

238
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,245
Something just
doesn't feel right about this.

239
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,316
Something smells good.

240
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,735
- Whoa.
- Thank you so much.

241
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,452
What's Preeya look like anyway?

242
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,623
Like that.

243
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,216
Hey! How are you?

244
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,718
- Hey!
- It's been a long time. What's happen...

245
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,143
Now we've got that over with.

246
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,936
What's up, Thomas?

247
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,188
Thomas.

248
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:12,025
Uh, first, why are we meeting here?

249
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,611
Oh, you know, support the local economy.

250
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,114
Plus, it's out in the open. Can't be

251
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,450
too careful these days.

252
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,119
You, I know.

253
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:23,829
Them…

254
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,207
…don't know.

255
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,003
Wow.

256
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,923
Oh shit.

257
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,091
Where are we going?

258
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,760
Ah, too many questions.

259
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,398
<i> You know who I work for?</i>

260
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:54,401
Interpol, police of the world.

261
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:58,238
<i>We know your Triad is meeting
with Ku An Qi, a known terrorist.</i>

262
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,240
<i>When?</i>

263
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:01,950
<i>And where?</i>

264
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,713
Good luck.

265
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,218
Agent Zulu, <i>bonjour</i>.

266
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,430
That means, fuck off.

267
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:25,974
Both of you.

268
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,152
You wanna have fun?

269
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,869
The Vie Hotel, tomorrow.

270
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,414
You might wanna call in the cleaners.

271
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,792
I thought he gave you the information.

272
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,669
The actual cleaners.

273
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:55,754
He soiled himself.

274
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,596
Uh, Preeya, meet the boys.

275
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,266
Boys, this is, uh, Preeya.

276
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,309
'Sup. Lu Xin.

277
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:13,355
- Lu, is that a "Sin" or a "Xin"?
- Is that supposed to be a funny joke?

278
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,274
- What's his problem?
- Don't worry. He's cool.

279
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,234
Uh, this is my man, Kai.

280
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,528
- Hello.
- Hello.

281
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,947
See? Someone's got manners.

282
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,366
- Where's your sister?
- Oh, she's not here.

283
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,994
That's too bad. I love Jen.

284
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:31,915
Anywho.
Hear you boys are on a suicide mission.

285
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,834
What the fuck, Thomas. You told her?

286
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,670
It's the only way she'd help.
I have to tell her everything.

287
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,588
Yeah, I like to know
what I'm getting into.

288
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,257
Due diligence.

289
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,718
If you know, then why are you helping?

290
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,637
I don't mind a little action.
It's part of the territory.

291
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:51,435
This woman you're dealing with,
serious shit. Lots of people dying.

292
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,644
She needs to be stopped.

293
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,521
Can you get this?

294
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,529
Let me make some calls.

295
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,741
Enjoy your shopping, boys.

296
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,202
Keep your mouth shut.

297
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,080
Shopping?

298
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,545
Mmm.

299
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:22,549
The fuck?

300
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,220
Thank you.

301
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,432
- Tommy?
- Yeah.

302
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,600
How do you know her again?

303
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,518
Oh, um…

304
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:37,689
So I was actually here five years ago,
and someone stole my Louis V backpack.

305
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,275
They took my wallet,
passport, phone, everything.

306
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,737
So I went to the cops to report it,
and, uh, the cops didn't do anything.

307
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,823
- So, someone told me to go talk to...
- Uh.

308
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,368
I'm just gonna make
this story short and sweet,

309
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,161
in case we ever have
to hear it again, okay?

310
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,331
He got his shit jacked,
and he doesn't know anything about her.

311
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,333
Okay, guys. Look, she's our only hookup.

312
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,920
- We need this.
- And beggars can't be choosers.

313
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,839
- Did you get it?
- Yes, every goddamn thing.

314
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,257
See?

315
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,302
Thank you!

316
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:11,223
Listen. I know it's none of my business.

317
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:15,102
But, you know, I'm fond of this one.
So I got to tell you guys that your plan...

318
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,229
Is none of your business.

319
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,980
Relax, big guy.

320
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,858
We're on the same team.

321
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:26,071
There is no way you're getting
that hardware into the Vie Hotel.

322
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:30,534
It's locked down tight,
and the only way in is through the front.

323
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,994
I don't like this. We need to rethink it.

324
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,372
All right. I'll take care of it.

325
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:38,333
No. Tomorrow, we're all going.
We're gonna get Jenny's killer together.

326
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,751
Hey! Yo!

327
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,212
Jen's dead?

328
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,756
Uh, yeah. Our target took her out.

329
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,174
Now it's our turn.

330
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,509
Shit.

331
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,429
I'm so sorry.

332
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,645
I can help you get in.

333
00:23:58,728 --> 00:23:59,896
It's dangerous.

334
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,189
I know.

335
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,860
Security there is tight.

336
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,404
We can use that to our advantage.

337
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,199
We?

338
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,921
Morning, boys.

339
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,465
Hey. Thanks.

340
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,385
Is this your idea of a joke?

341
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,053
Trust me.

342
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,473
This is 007 shit.

343
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:36,850
We're good.

344
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,271
Okay. Be careful with these.

345
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,607
Wow.
What's so special about them?

346
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:47,319
- Magic.
- Come on. Let's go.

347
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:37,827
Hey.

348
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,956
We're gonna get justice for her.

349
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,923
What do you think?

350
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:52,968
You don't want to know, Lu.

351
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,970
Then we're thinking the same thing.

352
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:55,887
Come on.

353
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,525
Hey!

354
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:13,113
Okay. Whoa, whoa! What did we do?
We didn't do anything!

355
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,030
Goddamn!

356
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,574
A bit much, isn't it?

357
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,617
Are you guys seeing this?

358
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,078
Looks like a dipshit nobody.

359
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,205
Ah.

360
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,874
Get up.

361
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:28,169
- All right. Easy. Easy.
- Can I talk to your manager?

362
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,963
Hey, we're just on holiday.

363
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,549
We're valued customers.

364
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,844
<i>One-star Yelp review on the way!</i>

365
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,013
Agent Zulu.

366
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,307
Let the hotel security handle that.

367
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,725
You just focus on…

368
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,169
Why are you here?

369
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,604
You're wasting your time.

370
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:30,231
It's for Songkran,
the Thai water festival.

371
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,567
That's not until April.

372
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,028
Yeah. Well, we like to be prepared.

373
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,698
Now you're gonna
have to reorganize her bag.

374
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:39,908
You for real?

375
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,159
Yes, I'm for real.

376
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:44,204
- Bullshit!
- Look at all this mess.

377
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,083
Stay here.

378
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,835
What's going on?

379
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,545
Where is our fucking visual?

380
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,839
- I'm working on it.
- Our gear is still working.

381
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,217
Whatever is happening
is only affecting the hotel.

382
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,428
Something is going down.

383
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:06,893
This is not good.

384
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,105
Zulu! Zulu!

385
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,410
Your card. ID card.

386
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,638
You are my men now.

387
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:49,894
Come on. Fix it.

388
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,648
- Close your eyes.
- What?

389
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,983
Just close your eyes.

390
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,401
- Trust me.
- Come on!

391
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,738
Hey!

392
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,037
Come on. Let's get out of here.

393
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,915
See you in a second.

394
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,399
Stop!

395
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,738
Hyah!

396
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,784
- Good timing.
- Yeah. Of course it is.

397
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:59,839
Ah, fuck. Who the fuck did this?

398
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,675
Hands where I can see 'em.

399
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:05,512
Zama?

400
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:08,556
Lu.

401
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,809
What are you doing here?

402
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,311
- You know her?
- Yeah, we met in London.

403
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,023
I was pushing some Aston Martins,

404
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,692
and my broker turned out
to be Interpol's finest.

405
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:23,196
- Look, hey, these bodies...
- Get down on your knees!

406
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,113
This wasn't us.

407
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,949
So you just tripped
and fell into a massacre?

408
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:29,035
Zama, you know me.
You think I would do this?

409
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,870
There's a lot I don't know about you, Lu.

410
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,790
This is bigger and more complicated
than you can imagine.

411
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:34,791
Try me.

412
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,125
The fate of the world.

413
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,170
- I didn't come to fuck around.
- Don't!

414
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,173
Agent Boucher.
I have two suspects. I need backup.

415
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:43,800
Boucher?

416
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:46,803
Whoever got them probably got your team.

417
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,890
Interlace your fingers behind your head,

418
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,892
and get down on the floor.

419
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,395
- I don't want to hurt you.
- Kai. Don't.

420
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:59,691
Listen to your friend.
He seems to be the reasonable one.

421
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,777
First time I've heard that.
Lower your gun.

422
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,074
- What the fuck happened here?
- We're working on it.

423
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,578
Let her go. She's not the threat. Please.

424
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:15,456
Look, it's clear that none of us
are the bad guys.

425
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,333
But they are coming.

426
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,793
Who's coming?

427
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,169
The entire hotel.

428
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,374
On your six!

429
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,544
- I got it.
- I'm just looking out for you.

430
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,963
- Because that's always been your MO.
- Here we go again.

431
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,297
You could just say sorry.

432
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,383
- What?
- Sorry works just fine.

433
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,635
Did you guys,
like, used to date or...

434
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,761
- No!
- No!

435
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:55,658
Zan.

436
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,035
Assassin.

437
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,328
Why are you here?

438
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,456
They offered me a deal.

439
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,208
The Wu Assassin in exchange for power.

440
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,263
Where we going?

441
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,977
-Fuck. Come with me
-Go!

442
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:40,620
Hyah!

443
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:51,589
Shit!

444
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,470
Fuck! Get in the car!

445
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,999
Looks like you're not
the only special one.

446
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,321
Look out!

447
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,214
Hey. Hey, hey, take it easy.

448
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,021
Fuck.

449
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,536
It's locked!

450
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,417
Go!

451
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,973
Door says push, not pull.

452
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,392
What?

453
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,694
Hold up. Where's Kai?

454
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,445
Don't worry about Kai, all right?

455
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,284
Oh shit. You okay?

456
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,368
Yo, you good?

457
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,414
Zan?

458
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:17,545
- Yo, we gotta go. Come on.
- My van's still here. Come on!

459
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,268
Get in.

460
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,317
- What happened back there?
- What happened in here?

461
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,205
This is chaotic.

462
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:54,999
You know what to do.

463
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:05,676
If only you would've listened to me
when I told you something's sketchy.

464
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,094
We didn't have another lead.

465
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,353
Take them down.

466
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:19,857
Get me out of here now.

467
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,573
- Shit.
- What?

468
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:30,159
In case you thought we lost 'em,
we didn't.

469
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,292
Hold tight.

470
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,464
Can you get to Khaosan Road?

471
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,549
- We have another safe house there.
- Yeah.

472
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,309
Shit.

473
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:10,908
It's the end of the road.

474
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,078
Shit.

475
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,502
Get out of the car!

476
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,879
- She's locking down the city.
- What are we gonna do?

477
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,131
Sail away.

478
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,049
I'm really starting
to strongly dislike you.

479
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:30,219
We get to the canal.
Take a boat up the Chao Phraya.

480
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,554
That plan is just...

481
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,601
<i>Stop firing.</i>

482
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,855
Get them out of the car.
Bring them to me.

483
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,693
I changed my mind.
I like the plan.

484
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,528
Yeah. River, boat.

485
00:40:57,329 --> 00:41:00,666
- If you wanna join me, guns are up top.
- Come on.

486
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,632
Shoot it! Let's get these fuckers!

487
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,447
Ah, fuck. I'm all out.

488
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,115
Shh. Shh. Shh.

489
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:54,553
They're trying
to burn us alive. We gotta go!

490
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,515
Okay. Everybody, follow me.

491
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:44,853
Hey!

492
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,775
Hey. Hey.

493
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,088
Yo, what's up?

494
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,803
Never seen that before.

495
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,930
I picked up a few things
since you ghosted me.

496
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:46,058
Yeah. Well, if I'd have stayed,
it would've been behind bars, wouldn't it?

497
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,142
This way. The river.

498
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:55,359
Get out the way!

499
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,861
Get to the boat!

500
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,075
Get out the way!

501
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,247
Get off my boat!

502
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,501
Kai! Look out!

503
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:20,300
Go, go!

504
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,108
- Get us out of here!
- Come on!

505
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,111
Hurry, they're catching up!

506
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,331
Faster, faster, faster! Come on!

507
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,398
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

508
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:01,693
We're almost there.

509
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:03,779
It's just up ahead.

510
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:24,675
Ah, Preeya!

511
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,051
You are back.

512
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,221
I didn't know if we'd ever see you.

513
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,352
Everyone's excited to see you.

514
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,104
So this is your home.

515
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:40,399
- It's been a while since I was last here.
- What about your family?

516
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,985
They were long gone before that.

517
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,072
Um…

518
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,199
What's this?

519
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,868
Magical protection.

520
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,120
If they don't want you, you can't pass.

521
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,424
I guess they want us in.

522
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,401
This is the home of a shaman.

523
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:28,322
He knows everything
about the supernatural.

524
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,240
If anyone might know what's going on,

525
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,075
it's Chatree.

526
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,912
You used to call me
a charlatan, didn't you?

527
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,456
Uncle!

528
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,337
It's nice to meet everyone.

529
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,506
You all must be starving.

530
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,508
- 100%
-How'd you know?

531
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:53,180
Usually,
I am the one showing hospitality.

532
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,222
You are.

533
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:57,851
It is my honor
to have such an esteemed guest.

534
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:02,564
What do you know about Pan Gu?

535
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:07,277
In Thailand, we don't talk business
on an empty stomach.

536
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,362
Is that a saying?

537
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,447
One that I just made up.

538
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,826
There are people after us.

539
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,371
There will always be people after you.

540
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,206
Here we are well-protected.

541
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,500
We have weapons.

542
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,306
Is this a prank?

543
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:41,979
No.

544
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,522
But it is funny

545
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:45,857
that this bracelet is yours.

546
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,402
But it is not for you.

547
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,654
You speak like Yoda, old man.

548
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:51,697
Baby Yoda.

549
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,450
I am only 50.

550
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:02,541
Pan Gu.

551
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,085
Uncle.

552
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:12,843
William Pan, he wasn't, uh,
completely honest with you.

553
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,970
Yeah? No shit.

554
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:21,435
Pan and Ku An Qi are opposite forces.

555
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,228
Yin

556
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:25,981
and yang.

557
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,151
But they are not
in opposition to each other.

558
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:31,695
They are two halves of a whole.

559
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,864
They have been working in harmony

560
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:38,410
through all their births,
lives, deaths, rebirths

561
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,454
towards one goal,

562
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,789
reforming back to Pan Gu,

563
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:43,957
the first man.

564
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:48,920
And using their power,
they will remake the world in their image.

565
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:55,719
And now that the Dao is broken,

566
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,055
they have the opportunity.

567
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,348
How will they do that?

568
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:03,727
By harnessing the Chi
of the one who split them.

569
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:06,521
The Wu Assassin.

570
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:11,151
The two of them
each have a piece of their old Essence.

571
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,612
The only constant they have,

572
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:16,531
forged from the stone
of the temple where they were split.

573
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,496
If they can infuse the pieces
with Kai's Chi,

574
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,664
they will be able to connect the halves.

575
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,124
Does it look something like this?

576
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:29,544
Where did you get that from?

577
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,798
I mean, it doesn't matter.

578
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,716
If it's part of Ku,
we'll just destroy it...

579
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,762
It can't be destroyed!

580
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,266
I've had quite enough, thank you.

581
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:44,267
This…

582
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:48,313
This whole thing is just crazy.

583
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,089
You okay?

584
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:23,473
I'm just trying to wrap my head around

585
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:27,811
this supernatural shit
and the world ending.

586
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:29,896
Yeah.

587
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:40,031
What did you do when you first found out?

588
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:47,414
I had just shot
a Russian gangster in the face.

589
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,834
So you could say
it was a little bit weird.

590
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:55,172
Honestly?

591
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,176
I poured myself a big fucking drink.

592
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,018
Ugh. This is terrible.

593
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:11,188
Can't be worse than that Chinese
whiskey we had in Brick Lane.

594
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:17,194
Yeah. Well, that was…
that was part of a job, so…

595
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,865
Is that what I was to you?

596
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,201
Just part of the job.

597
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,463
I can taste when you're lying.

598
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:53,021
Training?

599
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:54,689
Meditation.

600
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:58,777
My meditation is meditation.

601
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,793
- You're not worried about us losing?
- No, I'm not.

602
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:18,755
Because if that should happen,
Pan Gu would remake the world,

603
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:22,467
and we would simply be
the forgotten dreams of a butterfly.

604
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:25,011
Sounds peaceful.

605
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,263
But that is the one thing

606
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,807
that the Wu Assassin can never have.

607
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:33,561
He may have friends
that he's shutting out.

608
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,897
It's my responsibility to protect them.

609
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,190
You have lost one.

610
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,567
And now you're trying everything

611
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,027
to avoid that pain again.

612
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,154
They're all I have left.

613
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:47,450
But Pan Gu seeks to control all.

614
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,453
What do you want, Wu Assassin?

615
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,414
We'll stop him.

616
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:55,000
We'll stop him. We'll make plans.

617
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:58,378
There's a Jeep there.

618
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:02,007
There is the path
that leads to the main road.

619
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:07,262
From there, it's an easy ride to wherever.

620
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:12,183
You did not come here to train

621
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,518
or reflect.

622
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:17,731
You came here to leave

623
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,442
after everyone went to bed.

624
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:52,057
Last time I was here was, um…

625
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:55,393
Ten years ago.

626
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:59,105
Family had a farm by the river.

627
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,318
There was a bad flood.

628
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:09,741
Water came suddenly, and just like that…

629
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:15,163
My mum, my dad,

630
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:20,293
and my sister were gone.

631
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,675
No magical attack.

632
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:31,137
No clash for the world.

633
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,139
It was, uh,

634
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,183
just an accident.

635
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:43,608
There's nothing I can do
to bring my family back,

636
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:46,653
but I thought I could bring you
some peace for Jen.

637
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,822
And that is why I'm helping.

638
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:55,370
At least there's something you can do.

639
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,331
You have Kai,

640
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,376
Lu Xin.

641
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,423
Me…

642
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:10,593
I'm all alone.

643
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:21,688
I'm sorry.

644
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:24,649
I didn't know.

645
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,776
Well, you never asked.

646
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,599
This can't be real.

647
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:04,642
It isn't.

648
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:07,061
It's the version
of the village in your mind

649
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:09,647
from when you were a child.

650
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,400
But we can make it like this again.

651
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:15,612
We can make it into whatever we want.

652
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:17,113
Pan Gu is all.

653
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:24,746
Mum, Dad, Ratana!

654
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,916
I miss you.

655
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,294
You can be together again…

656
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:32,587
…forever.

657
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:34,756
All we need is one small thing.

658
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:38,009
The Wu Assassin's Chi.

659
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:45,475
It'll be easy.

660
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:13,604
- What are you doing?
- I had no choice.

661
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:16,190
What did they promise you?

662
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:39,422
Get up.

663
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:00,818
What's going on?

664
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,405
What do you think?

665
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:30,973
I fuck with these.

666
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:35,770
- There's more down there. Let's go.
- Yo! Tommy, hold up!

667
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:37,146
I'll get Preeya.

668
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:38,564
- What?
- Be careful, okay?

669
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:45,488
I am getting really,
really sick of this shit.

670
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,034
Tommy, get the Jeep.

671
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:51,994
We'll hold them off
while Zama and Preeya get here.

672
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:52,995
Preeya betrayed us.

673
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,539
- No. She wouldn't.
- What?

674
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:55,832
She took Ku An Qi's necklace.

675
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:59,752
- Fuck.
- Lu, get Zama. Tommy, the car!

676
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,921
- Hold on. We're stronger together.
- Just do as I say!

677
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:11,347
Shit.

678
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:23,192
Oh shit.

679
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:04,126
Zama.

680
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,629
Preeya betrayed us. We gotta go now.

681
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:09,131
I know. I saw her leave
with Pan's men. Let's go.

682
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:05,104
Calm down, boys.

683
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:14,989
Hyah!

684
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:55,738
Ah!

685
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:16,759
All right. Let's go, guys!

686
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:30,856
Come on, let's go.

687
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:34,110
Come on, everybody in.

688
01:08:37,404 --> 01:08:38,489
Hey!

689
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:45,538
You can no longer be stopped.

690
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:47,748
It's in your hands now. Go!

691
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:49,375
Don't let Pan Gu reform!

692
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,585
- No! Chatree!
- Get in the car!

693
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:53,546
- We need to go!
- Drive, Tommy!

694
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,884
We shouldn't have left Chatree.

695
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:43,179
- Should have listened to me.
- There wasn't anything to listen to.

696
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:46,140
- I made a decision.
- Yeah. Nothing new there, Kai.

697
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:49,059
- I'm leading us.
- No, you're not. You're shutting us out.

698
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:51,520
Guys, let's focus on
what the fuck we're gonna do now.

699
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:54,398
I'm sorry. You have no right to say shit.

700
01:09:54,481 --> 01:09:57,067
- What the fuck you talking about?
- What do you mean?

701
01:09:57,151 --> 01:10:00,404
Your little girlfriend that you brought
into our inner circle betrayed us.

702
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:01,780
You gonna put that on me?

703
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:05,534
Sure, you weren't on the lookout either.
You were occupied fucking Zama.

704
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:09,163
And, Kai, like, what the fuck?
What were you doing? What was your plan?

705
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:11,123
My plan was to kill Pan and Ku myself.

706
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:14,251
- Like I should have done.
- Yeah? Great, 'cause you're always right.

707
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:16,086
We don't need you.
I don't need any of you.

708
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:18,130
True! I'm going myself.

709
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,591
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Just stop it!

710
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,259
All of you.

711
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:24,470
You're acting like little children.

712
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:26,722
Do I need to remind you

713
01:10:26,805 --> 01:10:30,559
that we need to stop a god
from destroying reality?

714
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:33,395
You say you're a family.

715
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:36,315
You're not acting like a family,

716
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:39,193
not one that's about to save the world.

717
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:42,029
Because you cannot
even take care of each other.

718
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:49,703
If you can…

719
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:53,874
Just get over your anger…

720
01:10:57,378 --> 01:10:58,671
Your guilt…

721
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:06,011
Your ego.

722
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,020
We might actually have a chance.
We really might.

723
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:24,154
So, let's remind ourselves.

724
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:26,323
Why are we here?

725
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:30,911
For Jenny.

726
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:37,126
She's right.

727
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:42,673
We're all fucking idiots.

728
01:11:42,756 --> 01:11:44,383
No, no, no, no.

729
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:46,176
No.

730
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:49,179
I'm the idiot.

731
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:52,266
I'm a fucking idiot.

732
01:11:54,226 --> 01:11:56,020
For Jenny.

733
01:11:58,105 --> 01:12:00,190
- For Jenny.
- For Jenny.

734
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,783
Now we're getting somewhere.

735
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:14,538
When we were at Pan's temple,

736
01:12:14,621 --> 01:12:17,833
{\an8}<i>I saw that splitting symbol in a photo
of a factory at another dig site.</i>

737
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:22,629
That's where the stone came from,
so we gotta go to that dig site.

738
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:25,758
But they only have
half of the symbol completed, so, like,

739
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,760
they're gonna need your power.

740
01:12:32,222 --> 01:12:34,058
No. We shouldn't risk it.

741
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:36,393
No, no. We should. We should.

742
01:12:37,269 --> 01:12:41,565
Because they'll come after all of us
if we don't stop them.

743
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:45,944
This ends tonight.

744
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:49,698
If you all agree.

745
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,659
As long as we're smart about it.

746
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:54,787
You can count me in.

747
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:58,248
We are all the Wu Assassins.

748
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:01,001
Shit.

749
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:04,838
- Let's go kill a god.
- Let's do it.

750
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:35,577
There are a lot of guards here.

751
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:41,417
<i>They'll know we're coming.</i>

752
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:43,752
They already know I'm here.

753
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:47,131
In that case…

754
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:49,633
Boom.

755
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:03,605
This is where
the first Wu Assassin tore us apart.

756
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,023
They'll be here soon.

757
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,194
This Wu Assassin
is particularly hard to kill.

758
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:12,156
I got this.

759
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:17,828
This thing killed my uncle.

760
01:14:17,911 --> 01:14:21,415
How many more people have to die
before I get my family back?

761
01:14:21,498 --> 01:14:24,168
Your problem, child,
is that you see death as the end.

762
01:14:25,335 --> 01:14:29,006
You'll be with them soon enough.

763
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:30,924
Along with all living things.

764
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:40,476
That's where the stone is melted.
Those are the sleeping quarters.

765
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:43,061
- Those are the main pressing machines.
- How do you know?

766
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,104
Wikipedia.

767
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:49,485
We gotta be careful.
They still need you for the ritual, so…

768
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,321
Get down! Move!

769
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,453
Zan.

770
01:15:02,122 --> 01:15:04,041
- What do you want to do?
- We're splitting up.

771
01:15:04,124 --> 01:15:06,919
Yeah. We're not divided.
We're dividing them.

772
01:15:09,129 --> 01:15:12,090
I got Zan. Lu, the Beast.

773
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,717
You guys find Pan and Ku.

774
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,511
Fuck!

775
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:17,679
Try this. It's got good range.

776
01:15:20,724 --> 01:15:22,351
- Be careful.
- Okay.

777
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:23,435
Zan!

778
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:28,482
Let's finish this.

779
01:16:29,626 --> 01:16:30,586
I promised myself

780
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:33,422
I'd erase anything related
to when I was a pawn of your father's.

781
01:16:33,505 --> 01:16:34,840
We started with Jenny.

782
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:40,345
And it ends when I kill you, Assassin.

783
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:18,842
You're not the one I'm looking for.

784
01:17:18,925 --> 01:17:22,012
Well, we are who you've got, bitch.

785
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:29,663
The necklace isn't here.
None of this matters if we can't find it.

786
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,333
They're not fools, Tommy.
Let's go find the others.

787
01:18:37,587 --> 01:18:40,298
You fucking piece of shit.

788
01:18:42,342 --> 01:18:44,344
- The fuck were you thinking?
- Wait. No. Stop.

789
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:47,764
Hey.

790
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:49,516
Tell me they mind-controlled you.

791
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:51,977
They told me I could see my family again,

792
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:56,231
and I made a mistake,
and I'm so sorry. So sorry!

793
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:57,983
I messed up.

794
01:18:58,066 --> 01:18:59,025
Hey.

795
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:02,821
It's okay. It's okay.

796
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:21,047
Mastery over the body has its perks.

797
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:24,760
Fucking magic.

798
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:14,893
- Give up.
- Never.

799
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:02,816
Get up!

800
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:31,970
This isn't for me.

801
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:34,598
This is for all of us.

802
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:11,635
Welcome.

803
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:15,931
- Lu Xin!
- He'll be fine.

804
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:17,891
Your friends took out Ku.

805
01:22:17,974 --> 01:22:19,351
But you

806
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:21,937
will not be so lucky.

807
01:23:08,566 --> 01:23:12,696
I am Pan Gu,
the first man.

808
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:17,951
Control of mind, body, and soul.

809
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:45,729
Lu. Lu, wait. Hey.

810
01:23:45,812 --> 01:23:47,605
Brother. It's not you!

811
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:50,525
- Pan Gu!
- Kai.

812
01:23:50,608 --> 01:23:52,444
What the fuck?

813
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:56,156
The trouble is, you are but one man,

814
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:59,659
while I am all.

815
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:11,546
Brother, I don't want to do this.

816
01:24:12,964 --> 01:24:15,967
Thank you
for your sacrifice.

817
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,430
No. No!

818
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:28,683
Lu! Lu! Lu!

819
01:26:28,766 --> 01:26:30,185
Fight it.

820
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:32,729
We can't do this without you.

821
01:26:32,812 --> 01:26:34,772
Fight it, brother! Wake up!

822
01:26:36,107 --> 01:26:38,484
Come on, Lu! Get up!

823
01:26:40,528 --> 01:26:41,654
We need you, brother!

824
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:43,740
Tommy.

825
01:26:48,411 --> 01:26:50,747
- Come on. You can do it.
- Fucking bitch.

826
01:26:52,165 --> 01:26:54,792
I think we've got bigger problems.
Let's go.

827
01:26:56,085 --> 01:26:57,170
Let's go.

828
01:27:03,092 --> 01:27:04,344
What the fuck happened?

829
01:27:04,427 --> 01:27:06,679
Is that you? Hey.

830
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:10,600
Of course, it's fucking me.
Who else would it be?

831
01:27:10,683 --> 01:27:12,268
Nice.

832
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:16,189
Let's kill this motherfucker.

833
01:27:16,272 --> 01:27:17,398
Oh, fuck, yeah.

834
01:27:31,621 --> 01:27:33,039
Lu!

835
01:27:33,706 --> 01:27:35,458
- Kai!
- Lu, what's going on?

836
01:27:35,541 --> 01:27:38,336
- Ah, Lu! Ah!
- It's sinking!

837
01:27:38,419 --> 01:27:39,754
Grab that.

838
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:42,048
Kai! Heads up!

839
01:27:44,133 --> 01:27:47,136
- I can't hold.
- Hold on. Hold on, Kai!

840
01:27:48,888 --> 01:27:49,806
Lu!

841
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:51,975
No!

842
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:02,193
Lu!

843
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:12,370
Stay there. Zama!

844
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:13,955
- Yeah?
- Follow me.

845
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:20,044
Tie that!

846
01:28:24,215 --> 01:28:25,133
Gotcha.

847
01:28:36,769 --> 01:28:38,646
- This is serious, man.
- No shit!

848
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:45,278
- You guys know knots?
- We're about to find out.

849
01:28:45,361 --> 01:28:46,988
Girl Scout those ropes together.

850
01:28:49,866 --> 01:28:53,036
We'll bring 'em up with up this.
Let me know when there's enough rope.

851
01:28:56,622 --> 01:28:58,333
Kai, this isn't working.

852
01:28:58,416 --> 01:29:00,335
Come up with something.
You're the Wu Assassin.

853
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:02,628
Come on! Grab it! Grab it!

854
01:29:08,593 --> 01:29:10,303
- Zama?
- Almost there.

855
01:29:17,977 --> 01:29:19,687
Let me know when you guys are good.

856
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:36,788
Start pulling!

857
01:29:40,416 --> 01:29:42,460
Ah! It's about time.

858
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:46,798
All right, guys. I need help.
Come on! Come on!

859
01:29:48,299 --> 01:29:49,967
Come on, Zama.

860
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:54,555
Keep going!
Keep going! Keep going!

861
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:17,453
It's over.

862
01:30:21,124 --> 01:30:26,421
I know a really nice,
safe passage out. Come on.

863
01:31:38,284 --> 01:31:39,452
Food's ready, guys.

864
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:44,582
Looks good.

865
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:47,710
Hold it, man. First, a toast.

866
01:31:47,793 --> 01:31:49,754
To family. New and old.

867
01:31:49,837 --> 01:31:52,298
To family. Cheers!

868
01:31:54,467 --> 01:31:55,551
To Jenny.

869
01:31:55,635 --> 01:31:57,053
To Jenny.

870
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:03,351
So, Kai, what's next?

871
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,521
- I'm off to fight a necromancer.
- Ooh!

872
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:08,189
I guess we're going on vacation then.

873
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:11,817
- We? I thought you could handle yourself.
- What do you mean?

874
01:32:11,901 --> 01:32:15,279
Oh wow. Here we go with the talk.

875
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:18,533
Look, look, look,
just 'cause I kicked your ass,

876
01:32:18,616 --> 01:32:20,910
all of us saw it,
but we don't have to talk about it.

877
01:32:20,993 --> 01:32:23,371
- You wanna spar? You wanna try me?
- Do I want to spar?

878
01:32:23,454 --> 01:32:24,956
I don't got to prove anything to you!

879
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:27,500
You're the Wu Assassin.
I'm just the Lu Assassin.

880
01:32:27,583 --> 01:32:29,585
- You gonna let him say that?
- Oh!

881
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:31,420
Okay. Okay.

882
01:32:32,755 --> 01:32:35,007
- Oh my God. That's crazy.
- Guys, guys, guys.

883
01:32:36,342 --> 01:32:38,344
- Let's get him!
- Ah!

884
01:32:38,427 --> 01:32:40,388
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- He's going in.

885
01:32:40,471 --> 01:32:41,847
Get him in the water.
