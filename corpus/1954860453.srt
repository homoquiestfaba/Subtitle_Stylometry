1
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:50,321
Injurious To Health

2
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:47,511
While plying between
office and home in the taxi..

3
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:53,483
...l often feel that the
entire city is so standardized.

4
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:59,761
The same old sky-scraper buildings,
matchbox homes..

5
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,599
"The same old numbered streets.

6
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,634
The same old McDonalds,
Starbucks at every corner of the city.

7
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:14,211
And the same old routine
life in this standardized city.

8
00:02:15,534 --> 00:02:19,573
Unaccounted moments
in the office..alone!

9
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:25,155
The same old fast-food
lunch..on the go.

10
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:30,158
And the same old
coffee. Vanilla Mocha.

11
00:02:30,315 --> 00:02:31,555
On the go.

12
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:35,692
This routine never changed.

13
00:02:36,388 --> 00:02:38,527
"But now I intend to change it.

14
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:41,364
Now..no more office on Sundays.

15
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:43,165
No more fast food lunch.

16
00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:47,174
And favorite coffee.

17
00:02:52,104 --> 00:02:53,674
Since it's the last day of the year..

18
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,280
...l already made the
first resolution of the year.

19
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:01,657
Riya..

20
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:04,460
...what's your thought about marriage?

21
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:11,396
Riya..would you like to be Mrs.
Randhir Singh?

22
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:18,574
Riya..we're losing time.
Shall we get married?

23
00:03:20,532 --> 00:03:21,636
Oh, God!

24
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:27,540
Riya..let's make this
relation official.

25
00:03:32,678 --> 00:03:33,622
Riya...?

26
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:40,553
Riya...!

27
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:45,893
I can do it.

28
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:55,338
Riya? What are you doing
here so early in the morning?

29
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:58,180
Randhir, what's wrong with you?

30
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,476
Where are you going in the morning?

31
00:03:59,538 --> 00:04:02,109
Remember, it's 31st December.
It's a Holiday.

32
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:04,551
Office is closed for everyone..
except for you, of course.

33
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,519
There's little work
left in the office.

34
00:04:06,812 --> 00:04:09,224
I'll pick you up in
the evening for the pany.

35
00:04:09,615 --> 00:04:10,821
Exactly.

36
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:12,560
That's what I came here for.

37
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:15,355
Tonight's party is cancelled.
- Cancelled?

38
00:04:15,454 --> 00:04:16,865
You're cancelling the party?

39
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,366
No! Come here.

40
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:27,244
On this New Year,
let's make it a party for two.

41
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,640
Just you and me, no one else.

42
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,448
But Riya?

43
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:35,142
Jigar and lshmit have
invited us over. - So?

44
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:36,548
So?

45
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:38,178
So the point is..

46
00:04:38,243 --> 00:04:40,245
...you don't want to spend
New Year's with me alone.

47
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:41,289
Look at your face.

48
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:43,326
Just look at yourself,
you're sweating.

49
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,353
It's not like that.

50
00:04:46,518 --> 00:04:50,557
Look..where will we
have this party for two?

51
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:52,201
Where?

52
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:53,928
Here. At your home.

53
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,264
Here it'll be party for three.

54
00:04:56,428 --> 00:04:57,498
Papa's here too.

55
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:02,472
I've a wonderful idea for papa.

56
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,879
It's Bollywood Nite over
at Jamshed and Jeevan uncle's home.

57
00:05:06,271 --> 00:05:11,380
So..booze, buffet and free
item-numbers for 30 Dollars.

58
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:11,978
What else could he want?

59
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:12,814
Free booze!

60
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:14,748
Fabulous idea, right. - Bloody hell!

61
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,256
We'll be happy and so will papa.

62
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:20,895
Papa happy? - I don't think so.

63
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:23,591
I don't think so?

64
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:25,727
Come on, Randhir.

65
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,801
Whenever it comes to just you and me..

66
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,737
...you're always like
"l don't think so".

67
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:32,298
Papa is just an excuse, I know it.

68
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,814
0K8'!-

69
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,583
Okay?

70
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:44,480
Okay for party for two, right? - Yeah!

71
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:48,449
Love you!

72
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,994
I've a gift for you this evening.

73
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,292
Surprise!

74
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,837
Actually,
even I have a surprise for you.

75
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,370
Coming! - Surprise?

76
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:10,240
I'll get it. - You?

77
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:12,239
I'll tell you in the evening.

78
00:06:13,405 --> 00:06:15,407
Happy New Year, uncle. - Rumi, you?

79
00:06:15,474 --> 00:06:17,613
Is Randhir at home?
- No. No one's at home.

80
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,820
I already wished you
Happy New Year. - Yes.

81
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:25,452
Why do you drop in without calling?

82
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:27,590
Get lost.

83
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,394
It's a surprise, uncle.

84
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:31,933
I've been getting enough
surprises since morning.

85
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:33,002
Get lost now.

86
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:34,662
So what's going on inside?

87
00:06:34,726 --> 00:06:38,503
Plans to get rid of the old stuff.

88
00:06:38,563 --> 00:06:39,439
Happy?

89
00:06:39,631 --> 00:06:40,473
Now get lost.

90
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:43,012
You see, uncle,
I am heading to New York tomorrow.

91
00:06:43,335 --> 00:06:45,406
So I thought I'll go to
the gym with Randhir now.

92
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,676
Lala and Firoz will be there too.

93
00:06:46,738 --> 00:06:49,378
So I was saying let me in just.

94
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:52,945
I said get lost.

95
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:54,056
Papa..

96
00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:57,951
Perfume? - No.

97
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:03,825
New Year's Card?

98
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:07,667
Give me a hit. Come on.

99
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,837
Actually..l'll tell you after
drinking two glasses of wine.

100
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:18,076
Where are you going?

101
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,575
You can't escape me like this.
- Breakfast.

102
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,883
Randhir Singh needs
wine to gather some courage?

103
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:26,589
What dangerous surprise
do you have planned?

104
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:29,949
You..

105
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:34,796
Is it in the pocket? - What?

106
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:36,924
Hold this. - What?

107
00:07:37,522 --> 00:07:38,626
But.

108
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:42,130
These are your house keys?

109
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:44,540
Oh my, God..

110
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:46,337
Your house.

111
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:47,836
I don't believe this.

112
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,911
Your house keys..for me.

113
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:55,851
I know..l know..it's not much.

114
00:07:56,808 --> 00:07:57,786
It's.

115
00:07:58,343 --> 00:07:59,754
Oh, God..it'S..

116
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:02,724
Oh, Randhir, what a surprise.

117
00:08:03,515 --> 00:08:06,394
Keys and all..so sweet.

118
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:10,156
Such a romantic way of proposing,
coming from you.

119
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,164
I don't believe it.

120
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:14,570
Poor guy's in trouble.

121
00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:18,775
I won't need wine anymore.
- Honestly.

122
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,673
You needed wine for saying this?

123
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:25,012
Yes..l needed it once.

124
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:28,950
What? How many times
have you proposed before?

125
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:31,851
This happened 10 years ago. - But who?

126
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:32,980
You never told me.

127
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,524
Obviously, it was a girl.

128
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:36,183
Obviously, it was a girl!

129
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:38,657
Then why didn't you marry her?

130
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:43,992
Why tell her all that?

131
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:44,930
Fool.

132
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,070
What happened? - What else?

133
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:50,733
I ran to Amritsar! - Amritsar?

134
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,776
Yes. - And what about that girl?

135
00:08:52,898 --> 00:08:53,842
I don't know.

136
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:57,913
But I've heard she's
in New York these days.

137
00:08:57,969 --> 00:09:00,040
I see..she's in New York!

138
00:09:01,673 --> 00:09:05,052
So what are your intentions now?

139
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,612
Will you run away to Jalandhar?

140
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:12,490
I have changed now. - Really?

141
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:13,154
Yes.

142
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:21,104
Then tonight's party for two..will
be our last bachelor's pany.

143
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,661
Exciting, right?

144
00:09:23,228 --> 00:09:25,037
Last bachelor's party?

145
00:09:26,698 --> 00:09:28,439
Last bachelor's party?

146
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:31,840
Randhir, you look tense.
- No, no, I am happy.

147
00:09:32,037 --> 00:09:33,846
I am very happy.
- You don't look happy.

148
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:36,715
It's not funny, Randhir.
- Last bachelor's party?

149
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:37,685
So I'll leave.

150
00:09:37,742 --> 00:09:38,720
Where?

151
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,687
I've to prepare for the evening pany.

152
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:42,490
Drop me to the hallway.

153
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,726
Papa..l think I'll
get married this time.

154
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:55,568
I think so too.

155
00:09:58,797 --> 00:10:01,471
Papa..do you like, Riya?

156
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:04,045
You're marrying her, what do I care?

157
00:10:04,102 --> 00:10:05,979
Your opinion is important.

158
00:10:07,572 --> 00:10:10,951
Children often forget
this after the marriage.

159
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:13,020
Do you like her or not?

160
00:10:13,812 --> 00:10:15,758
Well, she's smart.

161
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:18,920
She already got the keys to the house.

162
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:26,031
Papa, I won't find a better girl.

163
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,104
And she likes me, and I like her.

164
00:10:28,994 --> 00:10:31,702
Only..like?

165
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,249
Tell me..do you like her?

166
00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:42,949
Son, look here..

167
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,651
I'm spreading out the crockery
your mother brought on our wedding.

168
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:47,246
Why?

169
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:49,758
Only for you. Party for two.

170
00:10:50,582 --> 00:10:53,529
And I'll go see that
oldie Jamshed in the evening.

171
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:55,594
Not for the bloody free drinks.

172
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:58,294
Only for you, son. Only for you.

173
00:10:59,224 --> 00:11:00,760
Thank you, papa.

174
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:03,972
If you want, I can turn
this house into a restaurant.

175
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:06,166
Look. Look.

176
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:09,837
House makeover in just 8 hours,
by Dolly and Polly!

177
00:11:11,036 --> 00:11:13,038
8 hours? How do they do it?

178
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:14,545
Dolly and Polly!

179
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,712
No, thank you.

180
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:19,980
But you must thank me for one thing.

181
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:22,781
When you were proposing inside.

182
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:25,987
...l drove your friend Rumi away.

183
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:29,063
Otherwise you would've remained
a bachelor even next year.

184
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,735
Papa. - Yes.

185
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:38,172
Thank you for accepting Riya, papa.
- What for?

186
00:11:38,997 --> 00:11:40,601
When the Lord has
already bestowed her..

187
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:43,077
“With the keys to this house,
who am I to say no?

188
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:49,284
And then..how long can
this old man be with you, son?

189
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:53,715
Papa.. - Stop making those sad faces.

190
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:55,256
Go meet your friends.

191
00:11:55,313 --> 00:11:57,054
They're waiting for
you at the health club.

192
00:11:57,315 --> 00:12:01,320
And yes, before you go..take
these duplicate keys.

193
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,324
Thank you.

194
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:04,698
Bye.

195
00:12:04,856 --> 00:12:06,028
Bye. - Have fun.

196
00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:09,032
Hi, Ira. - Hi, Randhir.

197
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:09,936
How are you?

198
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,997
Happy New Year. - Same to you.

199
00:12:59,744 --> 00:13:01,815
Sorry, guys, I am late.

200
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,765
Why the long faces? What's wrong?

201
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,833
What's wrong?

202
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:16,395
You know..poor Romi's new in Chicago.

203
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:19,404
He lost all his hair trying
to find your home. - Leave me.

204
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:23,639
And your papa kept the
cake and alcohol he had brought.

205
00:13:23,735 --> 00:13:25,476
And told him to get lost.

206
00:13:25,537 --> 00:13:28,677
Is this how you treat
your best friend?

207
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,380
And you want to know why we're upset?

208
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:34,854
Sorry..actually, papa didn't want.

209
00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:38,118
Actually, there was a girl.

210
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,393
I see..there was someone in.

211
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:41,362
So what?

212
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,529
You were only kissing her right.

213
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:44,757
Could've waited for a minute.

214
00:13:45,323 --> 00:13:47,701
You didn't exactly elope
with her from her wedding?

215
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:51,101
Well..it's about a wedding.

216
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:53,540
You..

217
00:13:53,932 --> 00:13:55,912
You're getting married. - Yes. Why?

218
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:57,640
You? - Why not?

219
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:02,143
This born-bachelor's getting married.

220
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:04,749
When did you get hooked?

221
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,047
I've grown sman like the rest of you.

222
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,590

But why do you want to get married?

227
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:21,469
You're wrong.

228
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:23,665
Where are you going? - Let me go.

229
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:25,398

231
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,674
Why are you laughing? Are you happy?

232
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:31,611
He's getting ruined.

233
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:34,779
Randhir!

234
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,452
What's wrong with him?

235
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:41,818
I said sorry.

236
00:14:41,946 --> 00:14:44,825
And I said "Let's celebrate,
sweethean".

237
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:47,953

I told him to collect the
passes from on top of the fridge.

361
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:11,720
...and my dress from the bed.

362
00:25:11,876 --> 00:25:14,982
Keys? To some Jas..you don't know.

363
00:25:15,112 --> 00:25:17,558
You weren't answering, obviously
I had to do something, right.

364
00:25:17,748 --> 00:25:20,729
And listen..don't call him "Some Jas".

365
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:21,921
I love him.

366
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:23,657
Love him?

367
00:25:23,854 --> 00:25:26,858
So you're already in love.
- Of course.

368
00:25:27,124 --> 00:25:29,104
We're always jet speed.

369
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,667
Love at first sight, baby.

370
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:35,504
Your Hilton passes
are still on the fridge.

371
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:37,838
I don't think 'Your
Jas' stopped by yet.

372
00:25:38,002 --> 00:25:39,106
What? He hasn't?

373
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,578
Don't worry, he must be on his way.

374
00:25:40,638 --> 00:25:42,675
Fine, I'll call you
as soon as he gets here.

375
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,686
Bye. - Please treat him nicely.

376
00:25:44,742 --> 00:25:45,812
I'll offer him some tea.

377
00:25:45,876 --> 00:25:46,786
Bye.

378
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:01,832
I love you, lshaan.

379
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,796
Jas?

380
00:27:10,761 --> 00:27:11,637
Hello.

381
00:27:17,234 --> 00:27:18,076
Jas!

382
00:27:30,047 --> 00:27:30,855
Jas.

383
00:27:35,686 --> 00:27:36,528
Jas.

384
00:27:45,996 --> 00:27:48,977
The number you trying to call is not.

385
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:51,646
Please leave a voicemail
after the beep.

386
00:27:53,737 --> 00:27:56,240
Vidya, that Jas is a drunkard.

387
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:58,753
He's lying here on the
bed completely unconscious.

388
00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:00,752
Call back quickly.

389
00:28:06,717 --> 00:28:08,094
He's so drunk.

390
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,029
Jas.

391
00:28:10,788 --> 00:28:11,789
Jas.

392
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:12,764
Get up. - Let me sleep.

393
00:28:12,823 --> 00:28:14,302
Vidya's waiting for you.

394
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,636
You've to take her dress and passes?

395
00:28:21,265 --> 00:28:22,801
You can't sleep here.

396
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:24,735
This is my bed.

397
00:28:25,135 --> 00:28:26,671
You've ruined the quilt.

398
00:28:26,837 --> 00:28:27,645
Get up!

399
00:28:27,805 --> 00:28:29,250
Get up!
This is the limit.

400
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:33,218
Let me sleep!

401
00:28:33,577 --> 00:28:34,851
Let me sleep!

402
00:28:36,113 --> 00:28:38,184
You're so drunk?

403
00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:42,153
Back on my bed again. Fine.

404
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:48,695
You'll learn now.

405
00:28:50,394 --> 00:28:54,672
Gentleman.sophisticated..killer looks.

406
00:28:54,898 --> 00:28:55,899
Wait and watch.

407
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:57,303
What do you think?

408
00:28:57,901 --> 00:29:00,108
I am going to kill him today.

409
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:08,749
Wake up.

410
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:10,957
Am I on the beach?

411
00:29:11,548 --> 00:29:12,959
Beach! Guess you're too sleepy!

412
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:13,788
Take that.

413
00:29:17,187 --> 00:29:19,030
Get out. Come on.

414
00:29:19,156 --> 00:29:20,226
Who are you?

415
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:23,805
What are you doing in my house?

416
00:29:24,728 --> 00:29:25,638
Go away.

417
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:27,631
Let me sleep.

418
00:29:27,698 --> 00:29:30,144
Your house? - Yes, my house.

419
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,009
This is your house? - My house.

420
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:34,208
Then where do I live?
- I don't know.

421
00:29:34,271 --> 00:29:36,751
Let go of my quilt.

422
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,647
Let go of my quilt.

423
00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:53,300
Are you hum?

424
00:29:57,594 --> 00:30:00,165
Why are there flowers?

425
00:30:00,831 --> 00:30:02,003
Don't touch this.

426
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:14,619
What a shameless man? You're naked.

427
00:30:19,316 --> 00:30:22,627
Butterﬂy..in my room?

428
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,561
Let go. Those belong to my kids,
for their concen

429
00:30:25,756 --> 00:30:26,860
Don't ruin them.

430
00:30:30,861 --> 00:30:32,568
Mama's crockery.

431
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:33,902
Excuse"

432
00:30:34,064 --> 00:30:36,044
Mama's crockery.

433
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:41,647
What did you do with
my mama's crockery?

434
00:30:41,705 --> 00:30:43,150
Don't touch any of my stuff!

435
00:30:43,273 --> 00:30:45,275
Where's my mama's crockery?

436
00:30:45,576 --> 00:30:47,146
I sold them on Ebay. Happy?

437
00:30:47,611 --> 00:30:50,854
You sold mama on Ebay.

438
00:30:51,148 --> 00:30:53,719
Not happy-

439
00:30:53,784 --> 00:30:56,162
I like my house better before.

440
00:30:56,253 --> 00:30:57,732
Take your clothes and get out.

441
00:30:57,921 --> 00:30:58,922
You fool.

442
00:30:59,022 --> 00:31:01,127
Do you even know where you are?
- Yes.

443
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:06,706
309 West, 7A..my home.

444
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:08,835
309 West, 7A..is my home.

445
00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:10,776
And I stay here with Vidya.

446
00:31:13,237 --> 00:31:15,410
I stay here with Vidya.

447
00:31:15,706 --> 00:31:16,980
Where's papa? ls he at home?

448
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:21,214
Papa and I stay here.

449
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,420
This is my home.

450
00:31:25,048 --> 00:31:27,722
You live here with your papa,
don't you?

451
00:31:27,818 --> 00:31:29,297
What's the proof?

452
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,357
Do you have any proof?

453
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:36,167
Proof? - Yes, proof.

454
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,840
Proof! Proof!

455
00:31:40,297 --> 00:31:41,708
0K8'!-

456
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,644
You want proof!

457
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:14,272
You won't touch any of my stuff.

458
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:16,675
But my papers were right here.

459
00:32:17,234 --> 00:32:18,736
Where did I keep them?

460
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,844
I guess Dolly-Pauli changed my home.

461
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:30,081
Found it.

462
00:32:31,715 --> 00:32:32,955
I found proof.

463
00:32:34,551 --> 00:32:36,258
Electrical proof.

464
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:42,235
Who's Randhir Singh?

465
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,968
I am.

466
00:32:44,027 --> 00:32:45,563
You're Randhir Singh? - Yes.

467
00:32:45,696 --> 00:32:47,039
You're Randhir Singh?

468
00:32:47,898 --> 00:32:50,037
Yes, I am Randhir Singh.

469
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:52,209
You're not Jas.

470
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,048
Jas?

471
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,050
Randhir Singh.

472
00:33:03,814 --> 00:33:06,727
How did you get in? - Using the keys.

473
00:33:06,783 --> 00:33:08,057
How did the keys work?

474
00:33:20,764 --> 00:33:21,970
Oh, God!

475
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:29,307
At least let me vomit in peace.

476
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:32,945
Never seen such a stubborn
girl in Chicago before.

477
00:33:35,078 --> 00:33:36,182
I am stubborn?

478
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:37,682
And what are you?

479
00:33:38,715 --> 00:33:40,319
You still think you're in Chicago?

480
00:33:40,717 --> 00:33:42,060
Where else?

481
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,127
Come with me.

482
00:33:43,186 --> 00:33:44,324
I'll show you where you.

483
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:49,770
Are you okay?

484
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,864
Oh, god!

485
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:54,275
Where? - Come on.

486
00:33:54,331 --> 00:33:55,742
Take a look. - Hold on.

487
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:57,745
Look..look out. - Wait.

488
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:01,848
Church?

489
00:34:01,905 --> 00:34:03,213
Is there a church outside your home?

490
00:34:04,975 --> 00:34:06,886
New York Gospel..

491
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:08,079
N ew York?

492
00:34:10,013 --> 00:34:11,151
New York!

493
00:34:12,749 --> 00:34:13,989
Iam in New York! - Yes.

494
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:15,155
You're in New York!

495
00:34:15,218 --> 00:34:17,664
309 West, 7A.. my home.

496
00:34:20,857 --> 00:34:21,927
How did you get here?

497
00:34:21,992 --> 00:34:24,029
How did you get here? - Hold on.

498
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:25,664
Out! Get out!

499
00:34:25,796 --> 00:34:28,640
Wait..let me think..how I got here.

500
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,170
I went to the Health
Club..with my friends.

501
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:35,010
They got me drunk.

502
00:34:35,272 --> 00:34:36,148
Romi..

503
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:38,052
Romi was flying to New York.

504
00:34:38,408 --> 00:34:40,911
But those rascals made
me board the flight to New York.

505
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:42,651
Okay..l get it.

506
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:43,350
I completely get it.

507
00:34:43,413 --> 00:34:46,053
Your bathroom looks similar to mine.
- Get out.

508
00:34:46,116 --> 00:34:47,789
I have guests coming over. Get out.

509
00:34:58,195 --> 00:34:59,139
What happened?

510
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,906
I think lshaan's here. - lshaan who?

511
00:35:02,299 --> 00:35:03,505
Go in the bathroom. - Okay.

512
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:04,545
Hey“

513
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,275
Why are you going in the bathroom?

514
00:35:07,504 --> 00:35:08,141
Where else can I hide?

515
00:35:11,508 --> 00:35:12,816
Ishaan's here. - lshaan who?

516
00:35:12,976 --> 00:35:13,784
What do you care?

517
00:35:15,245 --> 00:35:16,918
My boxers..where?

518
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,657
Bathroom.

519
00:35:22,953 --> 00:35:23,761
Hi, lshaan.

520
00:35:23,854 --> 00:35:24,832
H9'!-

521
00:35:27,124 --> 00:35:28,762
Are you going to
wear this for New Year?

522
00:35:29,593 --> 00:35:30,867
Then I'll wear jeans as well.

523
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:33,132
Let's get casual together.

524
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:36,576
Actually, I didn't get time to change.

525
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:39,272
If I tell you, you'll laugh.

526
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:43,176
Jokes later, first this.

527
00:35:43,974 --> 00:35:45,976
Happy New Year baby.
- Thank you so much.

528
00:35:49,913 --> 00:35:52,291
I've a gift for you as well,
but it's in the bedroom.

529
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:54,625
Bedroom. Wow! Let's go. - No.

530
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:55,629
No. No. No.

531
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:56,994
First I need to tell you something.

532
00:35:58,088 --> 00:36:00,227
You know,
after I returned from shopping.

533
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:02,170
...and went into my bedroom.

534
00:36:03,026 --> 00:36:05,199
You're going to laugh after
hearing what happened with me.

535
00:36:05,262 --> 00:36:07,765
A man's sleeping on my bed.

536
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:09,811
I thought he's Vidya's boyfriend.

537
00:36:11,568 --> 00:36:12,842
Ishaan.

538
00:36:18,508 --> 00:36:19,851
So this is your New Year's gift.

539
00:36:19,943 --> 00:36:20,785
This?

540
00:36:21,745 --> 00:36:23,019
Thank you and goodbye.

541
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,988
Goodbye for what, lshaan?

542
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:25,958
What for?

543
00:36:26,917 --> 00:36:27,895
That's why?

544
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:30,995
I've seen enough of
your third-rate drama.

545
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:33,534
I don't know him, ask him.

546
00:36:33,657 --> 00:36:37,036
He's lying on this
bed..in his underwear.

547
00:36:37,194 --> 00:36:38,764
And you don't know him.

548
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:40,074
WOW!

549
00:36:40,797 --> 00:36:44,643
This story keeps getting
better every minute.

550
00:36:44,701 --> 00:36:45,338
But no thank you.

551
00:36:45,569 --> 00:36:47,139
I don't want to hear it anymore.
- lshaan.

552
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:48,581
Ishaan, you will have to listen.

553
00:36:48,638 --> 00:36:50,117
This is not my fault.

554
00:36:50,707 --> 00:36:52,983
Actually, it's not her fault.

555
00:36:53,276 --> 00:36:55,153
Why is he giving explanations?

556
00:36:55,545 --> 00:36:56,148
Why?

557
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,751
So that I break his face..

558
00:36:58,815 --> 00:37:01,352
...and you feel that
lshaan's cheap, like us.

559
00:37:01,585 --> 00:37:02,222
So no problem.

560
00:37:02,285 --> 00:37:03,787
Ishaan, you're calling me cheap.

561
00:37:04,087 --> 00:37:05,122
I am not cheap.

562
00:37:05,188 --> 00:37:06,360
He came here coincidentally.

563
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,900
Actually,
he and his friends are alcoholics.

564
00:37:09,025 --> 00:37:13,098
So you know his friends,
and their habits too.

565
00:37:13,163 --> 00:37:15,302
How long has this been going on?

566
00:37:15,365 --> 00:37:16,207
Nothings going on.

567
00:37:16,266 --> 00:37:17,745
He came here coincidentally.

568
00:37:17,901 --> 00:37:18,936
Nothing going on.

569
00:37:19,002 --> 00:37:22,040
He came here coincidentally.
- Yes, I did.

570
00:37:22,172 --> 00:37:24,049
Romi was supposed to come. - Shut up!

571
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,712
Actually, Romi was supposed to come.

572
00:37:28,845 --> 00:37:31,985
Oh..so you were waiting for Romi..

573
00:37:32,048 --> 00:37:33,322
"But he dropped in instead.

574
00:37:33,383 --> 00:37:35,226
No, no, no,
I wasn't waiting for anyone.

575
00:37:35,285 --> 00:37:37,697
Not even me? I can see that.

576
00:37:37,854 --> 00:37:39,356
I was waiting for you.

577
00:37:39,623 --> 00:37:40,294
Only you!

578
00:37:41,191 --> 00:37:43,899
Look..l can explain.

579
00:37:44,094 --> 00:37:45,072
What?

580
00:37:47,964 --> 00:37:48,999
This?

581
00:37:51,234 --> 00:37:52,542
Anything else?

582
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:56,717
Let me go.
- lshaan, give me a chance to explain.

583
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:58,682
After that you can
do anything you like.

584
00:37:58,809 --> 00:37:59,947
But let me speak.

585
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:00,784
Go on.

586
00:38:01,011 --> 00:38:02,684
Actually,
he and his friends are drunkards.

587
00:38:02,746 --> 00:38:06,956
They had too much to drink
today..and made him board the flight.

588
00:38:07,017 --> 00:38:08,894
Oh, I am so stupid. - His friends..

589
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:10,293
There was a airplane in the gym.

590
00:38:10,353 --> 00:38:14,267
It was at the airport, not the gym.
- Shut up!

591
00:38:15,592 --> 00:38:17,265
No, actually they
went to the airport.

592
00:38:17,327 --> 00:38:19,329
...and his friends made
him board the flight.

593
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:22,942
And then he..got here
in his drunken state.

594
00:38:22,999 --> 00:38:24,842
Actually, his address is same as mine.

595
00:38:24,901 --> 00:38:26,073
309 West, 7A.

596
00:38:26,136 --> 00:38:27,979
But his is in Chicago, not New York.

597
00:38:28,138 --> 00:38:30,140
You say the address is same. - Yes.

598
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,311
But how did he get in
the house and your bedroom?

599
00:38:32,909 --> 00:38:34,149
Ishaan, he had the key.

600
00:38:34,811 --> 00:38:36,916
You gave him your house keys?

601
00:38:37,113 --> 00:38:39,150
No. - You never gave
me in all these months.

602
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:41,226
Ishaan, he used his own house keys.

603
00:38:41,284 --> 00:38:42,729
I wasn't even here, lshaan.

604
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:44,025
He got here accidentally.

605
00:38:44,254 --> 00:38:47,633
Oh..so he got to your
home accidentally.

606
00:38:47,691 --> 00:38:49,671
He accidentally took his clothes off.

607
00:38:50,026 --> 00:38:52,131
And accidentally
fell asleep on your bed.

608
00:38:52,762 --> 00:38:55,902
And you made a mistake
thinking that he made a mistake.

609
00:38:56,032 --> 00:38:58,911
And now..you want me to sit
on the pile of these mistakes.

610
00:38:59,302 --> 00:39:00,906
Oh, God!

611
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:02,410
Oh, God?

612
00:39:06,676 --> 00:39:07,586
Look, Miss.

613
00:39:08,278 --> 00:39:10,588
Miss. Forget it.

614
00:39:11,281 --> 00:39:12,954
Let me explain.

615
00:39:13,283 --> 00:39:14,591
On every New Year..

616
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:16,694
The guy's in your bedroom.

617
00:39:17,053 --> 00:39:18,293
"But doesn't know your name.

618
00:39:19,055 --> 00:39:21,831
What moral fiber? Amazing.

619
00:39:25,562 --> 00:39:26,336
Ishaan.

620
00:39:27,063 --> 00:39:28,770
Whose morality are you talking about?

621
00:39:29,733 --> 00:39:32,612
How can you accuse me with someone?

622
00:39:33,036 --> 00:39:34,242
Have you seen his condition?

623
00:39:34,371 --> 00:39:35,213
He's a drunkard.

624
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:37,682
He's got no clue where he's going.

625
00:39:37,841 --> 00:39:38,911
He's a joke.

626
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:43,318
Right..l am just a joke.

627
00:39:45,615 --> 00:39:49,188
Please don't ruin your
New Year for this drunkard.

628
00:39:49,853 --> 00:39:50,888
But believe me..

629
00:39:52,722 --> 00:39:54,030
"This key fits the lock.

630
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:58,370
And the address is 309.. - Get out!

631
00:40:01,698 --> 00:40:02,768
Sorry.

632
00:40:21,151 --> 00:40:22,687
Hi, Happy New Year.

633
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:25,826
New Year!

634
00:40:52,749 --> 00:40:54,956
Ishaan. - What were
you thinking, Tikku?

635
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,064
Some drunkard was lying on your bed..

636
00:40:59,923 --> 00:41:02,062
And you're kindly
showing him the way out.

637
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:04,627
Rather than calling me or the police.

638
00:41:04,794 --> 00:41:05,898
Like normal people.

639
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:09,809
Ishaan, I thought he's Jas.
- Now who is Jas.

640
00:41:09,899 --> 00:41:11,708
Talking about me? I am Jas.

641
00:41:11,768 --> 00:41:13,406
How the hell.. Who the hell..

642
00:41:13,803 --> 00:41:15,805
Sorry, Vidya's boyfriend. - Yes..

643
00:41:15,872 --> 00:41:18,478
Vidya said there's no
one at home so I came by.

644
00:41:18,541 --> 00:41:19,485
I am sorry about that.

645
00:41:19,542 --> 00:41:21,522
And she even gave me the keys.
- Yeah, I know.

646
00:41:21,578 --> 00:41:22,716
<i>Hold on,</i>
I'll <i>get the dress and passes.</i>

647
00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:24,224
Yes, please..you know,
I am getting late.

648
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:26,583
Nice suit, man. - Who asked you?

649
00:41:26,649 --> 00:41:28,060
Here. - Thank you.

650
00:41:28,184 --> 00:41:29,185
You're welcome. - Happy New Year!

651
00:41:29,419 --> 00:41:30,762
Happy New Year! Thank you.

652
00:41:36,626 --> 00:41:39,766
You gave everyone the keys,
except for me. Right?

653
00:41:41,931 --> 00:41:47,005
I didn't, Vidya did. - Alright, Vidya.

654
00:41:49,939 --> 00:41:51,179
Don't be angry.

655
00:41:52,075 --> 00:41:54,214
Why does this happen only with you?

656
00:41:54,477 --> 00:41:55,478
Why?

657
00:41:55,945 --> 00:41:58,186
No drunkard would dare
to barge in my house.

658
00:41:58,448 --> 00:41:59,256
But you?

659
00:41:59,716 --> 00:42:01,787
Why does he get in your home?

660
00:42:04,254 --> 00:42:07,827
I don't know. - What are you? A child.

661
00:42:07,957 --> 00:42:09,493
It's because you're careless.

662
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:11,966
You're always prancing
around..like a butterﬂy.

663
00:42:12,128 --> 00:42:14,608
You've no idea what's
happening around you.

664
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,546
Do be.. - I don't want to be angry.

665
00:42:19,602 --> 00:42:20,979
But you make me angry.

666
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:44,371
Excuse me, is this really New York?

667
00:42:45,562 --> 00:42:47,269
You really shouldn't
drink so much, man.

668
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:55,815
Excuse me.

669
00:42:56,272 --> 00:42:58,013
Can I borrow some money?

670
00:42:58,174 --> 00:42:59,175
No!

671
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:02,352
Why is everyone asking for a handout?

672
00:43:03,246 --> 00:43:04,987
It's New Year.

673
00:43:06,716 --> 00:43:07,922
New York!

674
00:43:51,227 --> 00:43:52,228
Ishaan.

675
00:43:53,229 --> 00:43:54,970
Look what I am wearing.

676
00:44:01,771 --> 00:44:02,772
Ishaan.

677
00:44:18,755 --> 00:44:21,634
"Come to me.."

678
00:44:21,691 --> 00:44:24,831
"Come to mesweethean."

679
00:44:24,994 --> 00:44:30,239
"Don't be upset, beloved."

680
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:35,980
"For my sake, sweetheart"

681
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:44,887
This aloofness will
definitely kill me.

682
00:44:45,181 --> 00:44:49,254
"Come to me.."

683
00:44:49,485 --> 00:44:52,261
"Come to mesweethean."

684
00:44:52,622 --> 00:44:57,594
"Don't be upset, beloved."

685
00:44:58,027 --> 00:45:03,136
"For my sake, sweetheart"

686
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:10,948
This aloofness will
definitely kill me.

687
00:45:30,126 --> 00:45:31,662
Who did you make these for?

688
00:45:32,161 --> 00:45:34,141
You know I don't like sweets.

689
00:45:35,131 --> 00:45:44,210
You said..let's take
the nuptials rounds..

690
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:47,949
"..With you right now."

691
00:45:49,779 --> 00:45:54,779
"Why are there tears..in my eyes now?"

692
00:46:02,925 --> 00:46:05,872
"Tell me.."

693
00:46:07,864 --> 00:46:10,845
"Tell me..please."

694
00:46:11,267 --> 00:46:16,216
"Didn't you promise me?"

695
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:21,811
"l am always where you are."

696
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:30,060
"So why this distance between us?"

697
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:39,171
I have no money.

698
00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:52,147
I've heard about
the craving for love.

699
00:46:52,208 --> 00:46:58,989
"But no one's craved like me."

700
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:06,866
"l walked for miles and realized.."

701
00:47:06,923 --> 00:47:14,569
"There's no place like home."

702
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:18,601
"Turn around.."

703
00:47:19,001 --> 00:47:26,681
Turn around..my arms
are yearning for yours.

704
00:47:28,077 --> 00:47:33,117
"L am treading on your path."

705
00:47:33,683 --> 00:47:42,797
Take me in your arms,
and fill this void.

706
00:47:45,628 --> 00:47:49,201
"Where are the paths?"

707
00:47:49,265 --> 00:47:52,940
"Who cares where we'll go?"

708
00:47:53,002 --> 00:47:57,007
"Who knows..take me to.."

709
00:47:57,073 --> 00:48:00,145
"..where the hean roams free."

710
00:48:00,209 --> 00:48:02,917
"Come to me.."

711
00:48:03,045 --> 00:48:06,686
"Come to mesweethean."

712
00:48:06,749 --> 00:48:10,993
"Don't be upset, beloved."

713
00:48:12,021 --> 00:48:16,970
"For my sake, sweetheart"

714
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:26,307
This aloofness will
definitely kill me.

715
00:48:53,162 --> 00:48:55,574
Stop crying, okay.

716
00:48:56,899 --> 00:48:58,936
Open your new year's gift.

717
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:03,710
Ishaan, do you trust me?

718
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:07,916
What if you had seen
me in a similar condition?

719
00:49:08,077 --> 00:49:11,684
A girl..in my bed. Would you trust me?

720
00:49:16,018 --> 00:49:19,693
If you were holding a gun,
and a dead body lying in front of you.

721
00:49:19,755 --> 00:49:21,860
I will still think you're innocent.

722
00:49:22,191 --> 00:49:25,832
Because I know..you can
never do anything wrong.

723
00:49:25,895 --> 00:49:27,033
I trust you.

724
00:49:27,129 --> 00:49:30,542
Even after all that happened,
I am still here.

725
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:31,974
I didn't go anywhere.

726
00:49:32,635 --> 00:49:33,875
What more do you want? - But, lshaan..

727
00:49:33,936 --> 00:49:35,279
Leave it now, please.

728
00:49:36,305 --> 00:49:37,807
Stop discussing this.

729
00:49:38,808 --> 00:49:42,517
Open your gift, and make me happy.

730
00:49:55,858 --> 00:49:57,098
Perfume!

731
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,162
Limited edition. - Like it?

732
00:50:00,863 --> 00:50:01,933
Awesome.

733
00:50:02,665 --> 00:50:03,837
I've a gift for you as well.

734
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,810
It's in the bedroom, I'll go get it.

735
00:50:04,867 --> 00:50:07,006
Another gift..in the bedroom.

736
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:09,207
Wasn't that enough for today?

737
00:50:11,807 --> 00:50:14,048
Go on, get it.

738
00:50:24,887 --> 00:50:26,127
HaPPY New Year!

739
00:50:26,589 --> 00:50:28,125
Hey!

740
00:50:29,859 --> 00:50:30,837
Very cool.

741
00:50:31,227 --> 00:50:32,069
Shaver.

742
00:50:32,962 --> 00:50:33,838
Why?

743
00:50:34,597 --> 00:50:35,871
Don't you like my stubble?

744
00:50:37,266 --> 00:50:39,177
No, I love it.

745
00:50:59,755 --> 00:51:00,995
What are you thinking?

746
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:05,431
That it's New Year
soon..and we get engaged.

747
00:51:05,728 --> 00:51:08,800
How abouLwe get engaged right now.

748
00:51:11,801 --> 00:51:14,042
Were you expecting someone?
- No. I'll just check.

749
00:51:14,103 --> 00:51:15,844
No, let me.

750
00:51:21,377 --> 00:51:23,687
Mr. Bumbling Mistakes!

751
00:51:24,413 --> 00:51:28,020
Why ring the bell? You have the keys.

752
00:51:29,051 --> 00:51:31,554
Mistakes are made only once,
not always.

753
00:51:33,022 --> 00:51:33,898
Hello.

754
00:51:35,891 --> 00:51:36,926
Actually.

755
00:51:38,694 --> 00:51:40,731
I wanted to borrow some money.

756
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:42,409
Excuse me?

757
00:51:44,433 --> 00:51:47,642
I left my wallet in
Chicago..and telephone as well.

758
00:51:48,471 --> 00:51:51,145
And I don't know anyone here.

759
00:51:52,408 --> 00:51:53,512
If you could lend me some money..

760
00:51:53,576 --> 00:51:54,714
...l would buy a ticket.

761
00:51:54,977 --> 00:51:57,150
I'll pay you back as
soon as I get to Chicago.

762
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,753
Send it through wire transfer.

763
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,158
You two have my address as well.

764
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:03,728
Yes, we do have your address.

765
00:52:03,886 --> 00:52:05,126
So what's the problem?

766
00:52:05,454 --> 00:52:07,195
You're in trouble.
And you're an Indian.

767
00:52:07,723 --> 00:52:09,532
We should lend you the money.
Right, Tikku?

768
00:52:10,626 --> 00:52:12,435
I think we should.

769
00:52:12,628 --> 00:52:13,698
If you say..

770
00:52:15,498 --> 00:52:16,841
I'll get it right now.
Okay? - Okay.

771
00:52:21,003 --> 00:52:21,913
Thank you.

772
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:28,818
You can give this
excuse to someone else.

773
00:52:29,712 --> 00:52:31,521
What's the real deal here?

774
00:52:32,348 --> 00:52:33,850
Why do you always come back here?

775
00:52:34,483 --> 00:52:38,090
Look..l genuinely need money. - Why?

776
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:40,325
Is this a donation camp?

777
00:52:40,656 --> 00:52:43,796
Tell me honestly..where are you from?

778
00:52:44,326 --> 00:52:45,703
I told you everylhing inside.

779
00:52:45,761 --> 00:52:46,796
Tell me everylhing again,
from the beginning.

780
00:52:46,862 --> 00:52:48,102
Come on, man..from the beginning.

781
00:52:49,498 --> 00:52:51,705
Look, every year..

782
00:52:51,767 --> 00:52:56,113
...l and my friends meet at
the Health Club on 31st December.

783
00:52:56,605 --> 00:52:59,518
But this year..l drank
too much because.

784
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:00,881
Because?

785
00:53:01,644 --> 00:53:04,056
Because my marriage was fixed.
- With whom?

786
00:53:04,747 --> 00:53:06,055
A girl, who else?

787
00:53:07,116 --> 00:53:11,064
Look..l came here by mistake,
honestly.

788
00:53:12,621 --> 00:53:15,534
Let me tell you how
genuine your mistakes were?

789
00:53:16,625 --> 00:53:17,865
You went to the gym, didn't you?

790
00:53:17,993 --> 00:53:20,030
Were you sober or was that a mistake?
- I was sober.

791
00:53:20,396 --> 00:53:22,103
Were you sober when you
had a drink or was it a mistake?

792
00:53:22,431 --> 00:53:22,841
I was sober.

793
00:53:22,898 --> 00:53:25,139
And did you get to the airpon
by mistake or in your senses.

794
00:53:25,534 --> 00:53:26,035
I was still in my senses.

795
00:53:26,335 --> 00:53:27,643
But I wasn't completely in my senses.

796
00:53:27,803 --> 00:53:28,941
I had to drop Romi at the airport

797
00:53:29,004 --> 00:53:30,540
So you didn't do anything by mistake.

798
00:53:30,706 --> 00:53:32,413
You were still in your senses.

799
00:53:33,008 --> 00:53:34,646
Ask what happened next?

800
00:53:34,777 --> 00:53:37,121
I got on the plane by mistake.
- Oh yeah.

801
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,689
Airplanes have special
reservations for drunkards.

802
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:43,091
I have to find that out too.

803
00:53:43,452 --> 00:53:44,362
How could they let me board?

804
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,522
I don't get it. - You don't get it.

805
00:53:50,826 --> 00:53:53,306
You don't know who
you're messing with.

806
00:53:54,463 --> 00:53:56,739
I work at the Treasury Department.

807
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,646
I'll file tax abetment
charges against you..

808
00:53:59,702 --> 00:54:01,613
...and get you deported forever.

809
00:54:02,037 --> 00:54:03,744
Send you to India.

810
00:54:04,006 --> 00:54:05,485
You'll keep sobbing
for the rest of your life.

811
00:54:05,941 --> 00:54:08,615
Got on the plane by mistake.
Are you blind?

812
00:54:09,311 --> 00:54:10,722
Got in this house by mistake.

813
00:54:10,846 --> 00:54:13,019
Even got on the bed by mistake.

814
00:54:13,582 --> 00:54:15,960
And by mistake, your bedroom
cunains will have flowers on them.

815
00:54:16,085 --> 00:54:17,996
And your sofa must be brown.

816
00:54:18,821 --> 00:54:20,732
Stay inside. - What happened?

817
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:22,827
Nothing.
Stay! Stay inside!

818
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:27,602
Let it be, I'll manage.

819
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,911
I mistook New York for Chicago.

820
00:54:35,437 --> 00:54:37,007
The house is a small thing.

821
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,419
Believe me, I was not in my senses.

822
00:54:41,477 --> 00:54:42,581
Not in your senses.

823
00:54:42,645 --> 00:54:44,488
You just admitted that
you were in your senses.

824
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:46,584
You're a big fraud.

825
00:54:46,649 --> 00:54:47,525
Ishaan.

826
00:54:47,583 --> 00:54:49,688
Ishaan, don't spoil your mood.

827
00:54:50,452 --> 00:54:51,954
Take this money and leave.

828
00:54:52,454 --> 00:54:54,456
Let's go inside.

829
00:54:56,158 --> 00:54:58,764
One gets paid for spending
time in your bedroom?

830
00:54:59,028 --> 00:55:00,405
You never told me that.

831
00:55:00,596 --> 00:55:02,041
So why throw me out.

832
00:55:02,398 --> 00:55:03,968
I could've made some extra money.

833
00:55:04,767 --> 00:55:05,939
What are you saying?

834
00:55:06,769 --> 00:55:08,373
You've crossed all limits.

835
00:55:08,437 --> 00:55:10,644
Do you know what you're saying?
- I do now.

836
00:55:10,973 --> 00:55:13,453
Everyone said "Avoid
single girls of New York".

837
00:55:13,676 --> 00:55:16,384
If you want to settle down,
check her family background.

838
00:55:16,445 --> 00:55:17,583
But it was my mistake.

839
00:55:17,746 --> 00:55:20,124
Your sweet voice and
great figure deceived me.

840
00:55:31,427 --> 00:55:33,805
Excuse me. I am sorry.

841
00:55:33,996 --> 00:55:35,634
I don't want this money.

842
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:39,608
Oh, how sweet.

843
00:55:39,835 --> 00:55:41,940
You could've at least
waited until I left.

844
00:55:50,512 --> 00:55:53,391
Ishaan..you're leaving me?

845
00:55:54,783 --> 00:55:55,727
Yes.

846
00:56:18,474 --> 00:56:28,054
This aloofness will
definitely kill me.

847
00:56:28,951 --> 00:56:29,895
I am sorry.

848
00:56:31,453 --> 00:56:32,397
What did you say?

849
00:56:32,888 --> 00:56:34,060
What did you say?

850
00:56:35,057 --> 00:56:36,934
You ruined everylhing!

851
00:56:37,126 --> 00:56:39,504
I told him what I told you.

852
00:56:39,762 --> 00:56:40,968
I told him the truth.

853
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:44,040
Don't worry, I'll go get him.

854
00:56:54,877 --> 00:56:56,015
Ishaan!

855
00:56:56,111 --> 00:56:58,455
Come on, lshaan..be reasonable, man.

856
00:56:59,348 --> 00:57:00,520
Stop, lshaan!

857
00:57:02,518 --> 00:57:03,656
Ishaan!

858
00:57:04,486 --> 00:57:05,794
Come on, stop.

859
00:57:06,488 --> 00:57:07,660
Ishaan!

860
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:10,793
Ishaan..you made her cry.

861
00:57:12,361 --> 00:57:13,772
Ishaan!

862
00:57:15,898 --> 00:57:20,813
"Come to mesweethean."

863
00:57:57,843 --> 00:57:58,685
Miss.

864
00:58:02,247 --> 00:58:03,885
His car was too fast.

865
00:58:04,416 --> 00:58:05,895
I couldn't stop him.

866
00:58:11,523 --> 00:58:14,902
Your friends,
family..shall we call someone?

867
00:58:19,665 --> 00:58:22,646
My entire family's on that table,
go call them.

868
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:30,979
Sorry.

869
00:58:34,279 --> 00:58:38,659
Look..you're sitting
outside the window.

870
00:58:39,251 --> 00:58:40,753
And it's the seventh floor.

871
00:58:41,987 --> 00:58:42,965
So?

872
00:58:45,924 --> 00:58:47,369
There's money on the table.

873
00:58:47,759 --> 00:58:49,261
Take it and leave.

874
01:00:29,961 --> 01:00:31,804
Yes! Happy New Year!

875
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,706
Three..

876
01:00:37,435 --> 01:00:38,539
Two..

877
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:39,814
One..

878
01:00:41,773 --> 01:00:42,945
HaPPY New Year!

879
01:00:43,007 --> 01:00:44,782
HaPPY New Year!
HaPPY New Year!

880
01:00:50,715 --> 01:00:52,217
Happy New Year, lshaan.

881
01:00:54,085 --> 01:00:55,723
Happy New Year, Tikku.

882
01:01:02,494 --> 01:01:04,098
Tikku, what's all this?

883
01:01:04,162 --> 01:01:06,199
What? What's all this?
The flowers..the glitters.

884
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,205
What is all this?

885
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:08,634
What kind of girl are you?

886
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:09,678
Even after everylhing that happened..

887
01:01:09,734 --> 01:01:10,769
...you're still celebrating.

888
01:01:10,835 --> 01:01:11,609
You're still happy.

889
01:01:11,669 --> 01:01:12,443
Why?

890
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:16,245
Yes!

891
01:01:16,741 --> 01:01:20,154
Because I am a foolish,
silly, stupid, delicate type of girl.

892
01:01:22,847 --> 01:01:25,657
But..the President
of Unlucky Club..

893
01:01:25,717 --> 01:01:27,162
...has a solution to everylhing.

894
01:01:27,685 --> 01:01:30,962
And the solution for
depression is Chocolate'.

895
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:34,166
Eat chocolate,
and it fixes everylhing.

896
01:01:35,527 --> 01:01:37,234
But you haven't seen the ring yet.

897
01:01:37,829 --> 01:01:39,274
The ring's inside this.

898
01:01:42,967 --> 01:01:44,913
Here's the ring,
and now we're engaged.

899
01:01:45,537 --> 01:01:47,039
What a silly.. - Oh no!

900
01:01:48,907 --> 01:01:49,885
Who's there?

901
01:01:51,576 --> 01:01:52,816
You're back again.

902
01:01:53,077 --> 01:01:57,958
Well..l heard gunshots,
and got scared.

903
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:01,130
What. - But now
I am tying this bandage.

904
01:02:01,953 --> 01:02:05,127
Actually, this needs surgery.

905
01:02:06,691 --> 01:02:08,602
You've troubled me enough.

906
01:02:08,793 --> 01:02:10,966
You're always going in and out,
in and out.

907
01:02:12,564 --> 01:02:14,202
Give me your keys!

908
01:02:16,034 --> 01:02:16,910
Silly man.

909
01:02:18,269 --> 01:02:20,647
Silly ..and sorry too.

910
01:02:27,045 --> 01:02:29,525
How long were you here?
What did you see?

911
01:02:30,048 --> 01:02:33,586
You saw everylhing?
- No, no, no, ljust got here..

912
01:02:33,718 --> 01:02:35,095
...and knocked over that pot.

913
01:02:40,825 --> 01:02:42,133
Oh no..

914
01:02:42,861 --> 01:02:43,839
What happened?

915
01:02:43,995 --> 01:02:45,099
Is it from lshaan?

916
01:02:46,731 --> 01:02:48,438
It's not from lshaan.

917
01:02:49,634 --> 01:02:51,580
It's my colleagues from the school.

918
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:55,083
They want me to post my
picture on Facebook with lshaan.

919
01:02:56,407 --> 01:02:57,715
What do I post now?

920
01:03:00,745 --> 01:03:03,191
I feel so humiliated.

921
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:08,931
Look, I have an idea.

922
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:12,797
Call up lshaan and
wish him happy new year.

923
01:03:12,924 --> 01:03:14,904
He'll be really happy
to hear your voice.

924
01:03:15,026 --> 01:03:17,199
And..and you two can get engaged too.

925
01:03:18,696 --> 01:03:20,539
How do you know about the engagement?

926
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:22,471
That means you saw everylhing.

927
01:03:22,934 --> 01:03:25,210
No, no, no, I didn't. - Then
how do you know about the engagement?

928
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:29,612
I love sweets,
can I have one of these please?

929
01:03:29,974 --> 01:03:31,009
Thank you.

930
01:03:37,515 --> 01:03:39,552
My name is Randhir Singh.

931
01:03:42,186 --> 01:03:44,564
Tikku Verma. - Very nice name.

932
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:46,928
HaPPY New Year!

933
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:48,169
HaPPY New Year!

934
01:03:50,662 --> 01:03:52,198
Shall we call lshaan?

935
01:03:52,664 --> 01:03:55,270
I'll call him, and you speak. Okay.

936
01:03:57,235 --> 01:03:58,543
What's his number?

937
01:03:59,003 --> 01:04:00,107
I'll find it.

938
01:04:01,706 --> 01:04:02,514
Got it.

939
01:04:19,791 --> 01:04:20,792
He didn't answer it, did he?

940
01:04:20,858 --> 01:04:22,963
No, no, no..the line's jammed.

941
01:04:23,027 --> 01:04:24,768
It's New Year, new Year's eve.

942
01:04:24,829 --> 01:04:25,807
Everyone's calling someone.

943
01:04:25,997 --> 01:04:27,806
Jammed..l'll try again.

944
01:05:27,992 --> 01:05:32,600
Only one hean can
understand another.

945
01:05:33,464 --> 01:05:39,142
"The memories were lonely."

946
01:06:11,969 --> 01:06:13,573
Line's still jammed.

947
01:06:17,875 --> 01:06:19,479
But don't be upset.

948
01:06:19,777 --> 01:06:20,915
Look at me.

949
01:06:21,512 --> 01:06:25,517
Exactly at this moment,
someone's waiting for me in Chicago.

950
01:06:26,017 --> 01:06:27,121
Riya.

951
01:06:27,985 --> 01:06:29,589
All alone in my house.

952
01:06:29,854 --> 01:06:31,595
She doesn't know where I am.

953
01:06:33,091 --> 01:06:34,798
She must be really worried.

954
01:06:37,228 --> 01:06:38,536
Call her.

955
01:06:45,002 --> 01:06:46,106
Thank you.

956
01:06:46,704 --> 01:06:48,877
And don't think that
I am doing it for you.

957
01:06:50,108 --> 01:06:52,110
I am doing it for that poor girl.

958
01:06:52,276 --> 01:06:53,619
I don't want any boy..

959
01:06:53,678 --> 01:06:55,783
...to trouble any
girl like this tonight.

960
01:07:12,864 --> 01:07:13,842
Hello.

961
01:07:13,998 --> 01:07:14,999
Riya.

962
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,203
Randhir.

963
01:07:16,267 --> 01:07:17,007
Excuse me.

964
01:07:17,068 --> 01:07:18,570
My God, what the hell, Randhir.

965
01:07:18,636 --> 01:07:19,808
Where the hell have you been?
- Listen"

966
01:07:19,871 --> 01:07:21,214
HaPPY New Year!

967
01:07:21,572 --> 01:07:22,607
HaPPY New Year?

968
01:07:22,807 --> 01:07:24,343
After making me wait for hours..

969
01:07:24,575 --> 01:07:25,610
...all you have to
say is Happy New Year!

970
01:07:25,676 --> 01:07:26,177
That's it.

971
01:07:26,244 --> 01:07:28,315
Is this what you call a surprise?
- I am sorry.

972
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:29,987
Actually, I am very-very happy.

973
01:07:30,214 --> 01:07:33,093
Riya, you won't believe
what happened with me.

974
01:07:33,151 --> 01:07:35,097
Why tell me if I won't believe you?

975
01:07:35,153 --> 01:07:38,259
Romi, Guggi..
- I've been waiting for five hours.

976
01:07:38,589 --> 01:07:39,897
I tried calling you 200 times, you..

977
01:07:39,957 --> 01:07:42,369
Where are you?

978
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:45,602
I left my phone in Chicago?

979
01:07:45,763 --> 01:07:49,939
What? Where are you?

980
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:51,110
New York!

981
01:07:53,738 --> 01:07:55,342
So this time you ran away to New York.

982
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:56,810
No, I didn't run away.

983
01:07:56,874 --> 01:07:57,875
You see, this time"

984
01:07:58,075 --> 01:07:59,645
Riya, just one second.

985
01:07:59,777 --> 01:08:01,256
Hello. - Just one minute.

986
01:08:01,312 --> 01:08:02,791
Excuse me. - Randhir.

987
01:08:02,847 --> 01:08:04,190
Where's the charger.
- Right behind you.

988
01:08:05,383 --> 01:08:06,361
Hello.

989
01:08:06,751 --> 01:08:07,627
Hello.

990
01:08:08,219 --> 01:08:09,357
Hello, Randhir.

991
01:08:10,188 --> 01:08:10,893
Hello.

992
01:08:10,988 --> 01:08:13,195
Riya. - Hello, Randhir.

993
01:08:13,624 --> 01:08:15,365
Wasn't that a girl's voice?

994
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:18,101
It's that New York girl
you mentioned this morning.

995
01:08:18,763 --> 01:08:20,800
No, Riya, it's not her.

996
01:08:20,998 --> 01:08:22,170
You're mistaken.

997
01:08:22,233 --> 01:08:23,803
I got her by mistake.

998
01:08:23,868 --> 01:08:25,279
Oh, just shut up!

999
01:08:25,703 --> 01:08:28,115
You left me here alone..

1000
01:08:28,172 --> 01:08:30,413
...and went to your ex in New York?

1001
01:08:30,708 --> 01:08:31,778
Aren't you ashamed?

1002
01:08:32,009 --> 01:08:34,182
If you wanted to dump,
you could've just said it clearly.

1003
01:08:34,245 --> 01:08:36,122
What dump, Riya?

1004
01:08:36,647 --> 01:08:39,059
I'm the one who's
been dumped..in New York.

1005
01:08:39,984 --> 01:08:41,759
So stay dumped in New York.

1006
01:08:41,819 --> 01:08:43,821
And I'll even send
your papa there too.

1007
01:08:43,888 --> 01:08:45,731
You two can stay dumped
in New York..together.

1008
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:47,895
And I am not there either.
So you'll be happy.

1009
01:08:48,326 --> 01:08:49,737
Where are you going?

1010
01:08:49,794 --> 01:08:51,967
It's not like that.
- It's exactly like that.

1011
01:08:52,029 --> 01:08:53,872
Son said yes and papa said no.

1012
01:08:54,165 --> 01:08:55,769
And let his son elope to New York.

1013
01:08:56,634 --> 01:09:00,309
I'm leaving your house-keys behind.

1014
01:09:00,371 --> 01:09:01,076
But.

1015
01:09:01,172 --> 01:09:05,882
And don't think that I'll
waste even a minute regretting.

1016
01:09:06,077 --> 01:09:08,250
Because..there's a
queue outside my house.

1017
01:09:08,646 --> 01:09:10,182
But don't bother to join that queue.

1018
01:09:10,248 --> 01:09:13,661
Or else I'll clobber
you black and blue.

1019
01:09:13,718 --> 01:09:14,128
Understand.

1020
01:09:14,185 --> 01:09:16,096
But we were supposed to get.
- Goodbye.

1021
01:09:20,224 --> 01:09:21,294
Sorry!

1022
01:09:33,371 --> 01:09:34,145
Here.

1023
01:09:34,472 --> 01:09:36,748
My story ended with a clobbering.

1024
01:09:37,808 --> 01:09:39,253
Nothing serious for men.

1025
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:42,015
You can find many more Riyas.

1026
01:09:43,147 --> 01:09:44,558
But I am not like one of those.

1027
01:09:45,783 --> 01:09:48,024
It took me really long
to find one nice girl.

1028
01:09:56,494 --> 01:09:57,438
Ishaan!

1029
01:09:58,963 --> 01:10:00,408
You should always be positive.

1030
01:10:00,998 --> 01:10:04,571
Those who get angry quickly,
also calm down real soon.

1031
01:10:06,203 --> 01:10:08,149
Go on. Go!

1032
01:10:09,874 --> 01:10:10,852
Hold on.

1033
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:14,022
If lshaan sees me here,
he'll be upset.

1034
01:10:14,245 --> 01:10:16,191
Where can I hide?
- No need to hide anywhere.

1035
01:10:16,547 --> 01:10:18,083
Just sit here quietly.

1036
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:20,351
Wait!

1037
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:23,455
All the best.

1038
01:10:29,193 --> 01:10:30,331
Hi.

1039
01:10:31,395 --> 01:10:35,901
What's up? - Baby.

1040
01:10:36,067 --> 01:10:37,102
Happy New Year, ma'am.

1041
01:10:37,168 --> 01:10:38,078
Happy New Year, Tweety.

1042
01:10:38,135 --> 01:10:40,274
Happy New Year, baby.
- Happy New Year, dear.

1043
01:10:40,404 --> 01:10:41,906
You too. - Congratulations.

1044
01:10:41,972 --> 01:10:42,347
Thank you.

1045
01:10:42,406 --> 01:10:44,181
We thought we should wish you too.

1046
01:10:44,508 --> 01:10:47,455
No, actually..lshaan and I want to..

1047
01:10:47,511 --> 01:10:50,549
Ishaan. Let's wish
your fiance as well.

1048
01:10:51,082 --> 01:10:53,187
Ma'am. - Come, come, come, baby.

1049
01:10:58,622 --> 01:11:02,069
Tweety, look at him. - Looking.

1050
01:11:02,893 --> 01:11:04,338
He's nice. - Yes.

1051
01:11:04,628 --> 01:11:05,663
Very nice.

1052
01:11:07,331 --> 01:11:08,935
Handsome too.

1053
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,177
Isn't he a bit simple?

1054
01:11:11,836 --> 01:11:12,837
Jeans on his engagement?

1055
01:11:13,704 --> 01:11:15,411
Simple men are best.

1056
01:11:15,906 --> 01:11:18,079
The ring should be big enough.

1057
01:11:18,142 --> 01:11:19,052
Right, Tikku.

1058
01:11:19,377 --> 01:11:20,754
Where's the ring?

1059
01:11:20,811 --> 01:11:24,725
Ma'am, we didn't get engaged yet.
- You didn't.

1060
01:11:24,915 --> 01:11:26,019
Well..

1061
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:28,794
Ishaan's flight got delayed.

1062
01:11:29,186 --> 01:11:31,689
Bad weather, you see. - Delayed.

1063
01:11:31,756 --> 01:11:32,928
So you should say like that.

1064
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:34,469
I was wondering what
does "Not yet engaged" meant?

1065
01:11:34,692 --> 01:11:36,103
Anyway, this is for you. - Thank you.

1066
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:37,104
Non-alcoholic.

1067
01:11:37,161 --> 01:11:38,299
This is also for you.

1068
01:11:38,362 --> 01:11:39,272
Thank you, ma'am.

1069
01:11:39,330 --> 01:11:43,176
It's okay. Now mama is here.

1070
01:11:43,834 --> 01:11:46,178
Things always happen for the best.

1071
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:49,251
We'll get you two engaged. No problem.

1072
01:11:49,306 --> 01:11:52,219
Tweety, call up Mr. Khan
and tell him to come here. Quickly.

1073
01:11:52,276 --> 01:11:53,311
Done.

1074
01:11:53,711 --> 01:11:54,314
Hello.

1075
01:11:54,378 --> 01:11:55,721
Mr. Khan. - Tweety..

1076
01:11:55,846 --> 01:11:57,348
Please come down here,
at Tikku's home.

1077
01:11:57,815 --> 01:11:59,317
Yes, bring everyone along.

1078
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:01,725
Good you invited over everyone.

1079
01:12:03,754 --> 01:12:07,167
Allahwonderful.

1080
01:12:07,224 --> 01:12:10,205
So sweet! So charming.

1081
01:12:10,261 --> 01:12:12,332
I had a big desire to meet you.

1082
01:12:12,396 --> 01:12:14,171
I've heard lot of praises from Tikku.

1083
01:12:14,298 --> 01:12:16,039
Mine? Really?

1084
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:18,171
Oh..introductions first.

1085
01:12:18,235 --> 01:12:20,442
This is Khanum, Tikku's boss.

1086
01:12:20,504 --> 01:12:23,314
And I am Tikku's colleague,
Tweety Chawla.

1087
01:12:23,374 --> 01:12:25,820
I am Tikku's adopted mama.

1088
01:12:26,143 --> 01:12:27,383
Mama. - Mama.

1089
01:12:27,445 --> 01:12:30,119
She adopted me,
and I adopted her. Right?

1090
01:12:30,414 --> 01:12:31,916
I'll just get it. - Yes.

1091
01:12:32,416 --> 01:12:36,091
Actually,
Tikku and I made a plan. You see.

1092
01:12:36,153 --> 01:12:38,793
I hope you will like it too.

1093
01:12:38,956 --> 01:12:40,936
He will..of course he'll like it.

1094
01:12:41,091 --> 01:12:43,002
Is everylhing alright? - Of course.

1095
01:12:43,227 --> 01:12:44,262
Come in.

1096
01:12:44,328 --> 01:12:45,204
Meet him.

1097
01:12:45,262 --> 01:12:46,900
This is my husband. Mr. Khan.

1098
01:12:46,997 --> 01:12:49,773
Hello. - And that one
at the back..is Bashruddin.

1099
01:12:49,834 --> 01:12:50,539
Hello.

1100
01:12:50,768 --> 01:12:55,080
Naima..Abida..Nasir..Firoza, lmran..

1101
01:12:55,139 --> 01:12:57,050
Imran, lmran..

1102
01:12:57,274 --> 01:12:59,015
And I am lmran too. - Yes, of course.

1103
01:12:59,276 --> 01:13:01,256
Since there are so many lmrans..

1104
01:13:01,545 --> 01:13:02,990
...there has to be one lmran Khan.

1105
01:13:08,519 --> 01:13:10,192
Dear, why did you call us here?

1106
01:13:10,254 --> 01:13:14,100
Why? We've to get
Tikku and lshaan engaged.

1107
01:13:14,558 --> 01:13:15,536
Ishaan? - Yes.

1108
01:13:15,593 --> 01:13:18,073
But where's lshaan?

1109
01:13:24,268 --> 01:13:25,269
He's so funny.

1110
01:13:25,336 --> 01:13:26,542
He's got a sense of humor.

1111
01:13:26,604 --> 01:13:29,278
Ishaan, come on.
This is not the time to joke.

1112
01:13:32,309 --> 01:13:33,253
He's funny.

1113
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:37,656
So funny.

1114
01:13:37,715 --> 01:13:39,126
Let's first get you two engaged..

1115
01:13:39,183 --> 01:13:41,390
...and then we'll together
search for lshaan.

1116
01:13:43,087 --> 01:13:45,089
Good sense of humor. I like it.

1117
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:47,401
What are you doing?

1118
01:13:47,558 --> 01:13:48,730
Why are you calling me lshaan?

1119
01:13:49,093 --> 01:13:49,696
What.

1120
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:50,670
Why will I make you lshaan?

1121
01:13:50,728 --> 01:13:51,536
Who do you think you are?

1122
01:13:51,662 --> 01:13:54,199
You think"
- Hello..conversation in private.

1123
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:56,172
Shave.

1124
01:13:56,433 --> 01:13:58,140
You look more handsome.

1125
01:13:58,869 --> 01:14:00,405
Until then I'll help her freshen up.

1126
01:14:00,471 --> 01:14:01,609
Come on.

1127
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:08,749
Randhir..don't say a word.

1128
01:14:08,812 --> 01:14:11,554
Let things proceed
as they are. - But.

1129
01:14:11,615 --> 01:14:12,423
No!

1130
01:14:12,483 --> 01:14:14,190
It's imponant for you to know..

1131
01:14:14,251 --> 01:14:17,494
...others don't treat
me the way lshaan does.

1132
01:14:17,621 --> 01:14:18,861
I am quite respected.

1133
01:14:19,089 --> 01:14:20,830
...and especially,
in the school where I work.

1134
01:14:20,891 --> 01:14:22,666
I'll even be the principal next year.

1135
01:14:22,726 --> 01:14:23,864
I'll get promoted.

1136
01:14:24,094 --> 01:14:25,095
Please don't say anylhing.

1137
01:14:25,162 --> 01:14:26,698
Or else my impression
will be completely ruined.

1138
01:14:26,764 --> 01:14:28,607
Please.. - I won't say anylhing.

1139
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:30,770
What do you want?

1140
01:14:31,168 --> 01:14:33,774
We should get engaged..to
save your impression.

1141
01:14:33,837 --> 01:14:35,908
So..you want to say
that you won't help me?

1142
01:14:36,273 --> 01:14:37,513
So should we get engaged?

1143
01:14:37,808 --> 01:14:40,618
You see..l just got
out of a relationship.

1144
01:14:40,678 --> 01:14:42,385
I don't like to get into commitments.

1145
01:14:44,181 --> 01:14:45,558
I don't like what's happening.

1146
01:14:45,616 --> 01:14:47,289
You think I like this.

1147
01:14:47,351 --> 01:14:49,592
You're standing in my
bathroom with lshaan's shaver.

1148
01:14:49,653 --> 01:14:50,495
And you think I like it.

1149
01:14:50,554 --> 01:14:53,330
What's lshaan's shaver
doing in this bathroom?

1150
01:14:54,458 --> 01:14:56,438
Ishaan's shaver will
stay in this bathroom.

1151
01:14:56,493 --> 01:14:58,632
And all his things
will stay right here.

1152
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:02,936
I see..where's lshaan
now to help you out?

1153
01:15:08,439 --> 01:15:12,512
When lshaan didn't help me,
why would you?

1154
01:15:15,613 --> 01:15:17,320
I'll tell them the truth myself.

1155
01:15:17,615 --> 01:15:18,593
Thank you.

1156
01:15:23,921 --> 01:15:26,458
Hold the veil like this.
- Hold it up..

1157
01:15:26,557 --> 01:15:28,264
Ma'am, I've to talk to you.
- Not now..

1158
01:15:28,459 --> 01:15:30,939
"Do Re Me Fa So La."

1159
01:15:31,362 --> 01:15:33,933
"Do Re Me Fa So La."

1160
01:15:34,198 --> 01:15:36,769
"No one said a word."

1161
01:15:37,034 --> 01:15:39,241
"Or revealed this secret." - But you..

1162
01:15:43,874 --> 01:15:45,945
"Could you be the one?"

1163
01:15:48,445 --> 01:15:50,789
"Could you be the one?"

1164
01:15:50,881 --> 01:15:52,451
"One for me."

1165
01:15:52,516 --> 01:15:55,986
10, 9, 8,
7, 6, 5, 4..3, 2, murder 1..

1166
01:15:56,053 --> 01:15:57,157
"Love's at the door."

1167
01:15:57,221 --> 01:15:59,098
"Hear the soft footsteps."

1168
01:15:59,390 --> 01:16:01,370
"Here comes trouble."

1169
01:16:01,792 --> 01:16:03,794
"Try to understand."

1170
01:16:04,094 --> 01:16:05,539
"..the delicate situation."

1171
01:16:05,896 --> 01:16:10,208
That. - Everyone thinks
I am crazy about you.

1172
01:16:10,334 --> 01:16:14,874
Why.. - Because all
my happiness stans with you.

1173
01:16:15,005 --> 01:16:19,385
Love.. - This is what
everyone says..says to me.

1174
01:16:19,443 --> 01:16:23,516
What.. - Say that you
feel the same about me.

1175
01:16:24,882 --> 01:16:25,883
"You.."

1176
01:16:26,016 --> 01:16:28,087
"Are you the one?"

1177
01:16:28,285 --> 01:16:36,067
"The one my hearl's..crazy for."

1178
01:16:36,326 --> 01:16:40,934
"And my feet are staggering."

1179
01:16:55,746 --> 01:17:00,252
No one knocked on the
door of your hean like this.

1180
01:17:00,317 --> 01:17:04,993
Now that you're here..there's
a hustle-bustle everywhere.

1181
01:17:05,055 --> 01:17:09,595
"Nothing happened between you and me."

1182
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:13,665
But still..the earth keeps
slipping from under my feet.

1183
01:17:13,797 --> 01:17:18,109
You.. - Whether you ask me or not,
but I'll have to tell you.

1184
01:17:18,168 --> 01:17:22,742
L.. - Whatever you do now,
the head's crazy about you.

1185
01:17:22,873 --> 01:17:27,219
Love.. - This is what
everyone says..says to me.

1186
01:17:27,377 --> 01:17:31,621
What.. - Say that you
feel the same about me.

1187
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:33,751
"You.."

1188
01:17:33,884 --> 01:17:35,830
"Are you the one?"

1189
01:17:36,153 --> 01:17:44,004
"The one my hearl's..crazy for."

1190
01:17:44,228 --> 01:17:49,177
"And my feet are staggering."

1191
01:17:49,967 --> 01:17:53,346
10, 9, 8,
7, 6, 5, 4..3, 2, murder 1..

1192
01:17:53,403 --> 01:17:54,438
"Love's at the door."

1193
01:17:54,671 --> 01:17:56,912
"Knock, knock, knock we go bonkers."

1194
01:17:56,974 --> 01:17:59,181
Knock, knock,
knock we're show-stoppers.

1195
01:17:59,243 --> 01:18:01,382
Tonight we're gonna
blast the speakers.

1196
01:18:01,445 --> 01:18:04,085
"Scream out loud and lose your voice."

1197
01:18:13,023 --> 01:18:17,267
I was holding a blank
paper in my hands.

1198
01:18:17,728 --> 01:18:22,199
"But you filled it with many colors."

1199
01:18:22,266 --> 01:18:26,840
Why did the hean blossom
and staned humming.

1200
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:30,975
Why wait for another
lifetime for such happiness?

1201
01:18:31,041 --> 01:18:35,387
You.. - Can turn around whenever
you like and take a look.

1202
01:18:35,445 --> 01:18:39,985
L.. - I'll walk up and
cuddle back in your arms.

1203
01:18:40,050 --> 01:18:44,465
Love.. - This is what
everyone says..says to me.

1204
01:18:44,688 --> 01:18:49,228
What.. - Say that you
feel the same about me.

1205
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:51,030
"You.."

1206
01:18:51,094 --> 01:18:53,074
"Are you the one?"

1207
01:18:53,330 --> 01:19:01,340
"The one my hearl's..crazy for."

1208
01:19:01,405 --> 01:19:06,377
"And my feet are staggering."

1209
01:19:12,049 --> 01:19:12,823
Tikku.

1210
01:19:14,985 --> 01:19:19,229
So, lshaan,
isn't Tikku really special.

1211
01:19:20,958 --> 01:19:24,838
But life's been really unfair
with her when it came to families.

1212
01:19:26,730 --> 01:19:29,904
But still..she's always smiling,
cheerful.

1213
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,310
Tikku's a sunshine child.

1214
01:19:33,203 --> 01:19:36,377
And Allah has blessed
her with a reward.

1215
01:19:36,607 --> 01:19:38,416
Otherwise,
how could she find a groom like you..

1216
01:19:38,642 --> 01:19:40,019
...from that bloody Matrimonial Ad?

1217
01:19:40,143 --> 01:19:41,019
No!

1218
01:19:41,178 --> 01:19:43,089
But see..you two did meet.

1219
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:48,022
Now lshaan, you have to
wipe the tears behind that smile.

1220
01:19:48,252 --> 01:19:51,893
...and fill the void with a family.

1221
01:19:51,955 --> 01:19:53,400
Right, lshaan.

1222
01:19:54,057 --> 01:19:56,765
Won't you take good care of Tikku?

1223
01:19:59,897 --> 01:20:00,671
Good.

1224
01:20:12,743 --> 01:20:13,778
Bless you, Tikku.

1225
01:20:13,844 --> 01:20:14,822
Thank you. - Bye, Tikku.

1226
01:20:14,878 --> 01:20:15,982
Thank you so much.

1227
01:20:16,046 --> 01:20:17,024
Bye.

1228
01:20:17,714 --> 01:20:18,715
Thank you so much. - Bye.

1229
01:20:20,651 --> 01:20:21,755
What a nice man.

1230
01:20:21,885 --> 01:20:22,886
I really like him.

1231
01:20:23,153 --> 01:20:24,860
He's a gem.

1232
01:20:25,722 --> 01:20:26,757
Thank you, ma'am.

1233
01:20:35,098 --> 01:20:36,771
Congratulations.

1234
01:20:38,035 --> 01:20:39,480
Why did you do it?

1235
01:20:40,904 --> 01:20:41,848
What else could I do?

1236
01:20:42,272 --> 01:20:43,114
If I told them the truth..

1237
01:20:43,173 --> 01:20:44,709
...you would've never
become the Principal.

1238
01:20:44,908 --> 01:20:45,978
That's why.

1239
01:20:49,813 --> 01:20:51,224
Congratulations for what?

1240
01:20:51,748 --> 01:20:53,728
Everyone wished us on our engagement.

1241
01:20:54,017 --> 01:20:55,928
But we didn't wish each other.

1242
01:20:56,853 --> 01:20:57,797
Very funny.

1243
01:20:59,723 --> 01:21:02,033
Exchanging rings mean nothing.

1244
01:21:02,526 --> 01:21:05,564
Think of it as some
scene from the movies.

1245
01:21:06,063 --> 01:21:08,236
Take the ring out and dump it.

1246
01:21:08,832 --> 01:21:10,243
What has the world come to?

1247
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,046
First the girl insists
you to get engaged.

1248
01:21:13,203 --> 01:21:16,776
And then..she chucks
the ring away and breaks it.

1249
01:21:17,074 --> 01:21:18,644
Here, you do it.

1250
01:21:25,148 --> 01:21:26,092
Just to remind you..

1251
01:21:26,183 --> 01:21:29,164
...you insisted for
this engagement, not me.

1252
01:21:30,087 --> 01:21:33,296
Yes..but now we got to think"

1253
01:21:33,523 --> 01:21:36,094
...how we'll introduce
them to the real lshaan.

1254
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:37,570
We? - Yes.

1255
01:21:38,128 --> 01:21:40,904
This is not our problem,
it's just my problem.

1256
01:21:41,098 --> 01:21:43,100
Ishaan's gone.

1257
01:21:43,533 --> 01:21:45,535
And I guess this chapter is over.

1258
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:47,910
I'll make any excuse.

1259
01:21:48,205 --> 01:21:51,118
I'll tell them that
lshaan rejected me.

1260
01:21:51,541 --> 01:21:54,784
You mean..l rejected you.
- Not you, lshaan did.

1261
01:21:55,545 --> 01:21:58,822
But..when they talk about lshaan,
they will think of me.

1262
01:21:59,583 --> 01:22:01,062
So what's the problem?

1263
01:22:02,619 --> 01:22:05,566
The problem is that
only a fool can reject you.

1264
01:22:06,056 --> 01:22:08,297
But why do you want
that fool to be me?

1265
01:22:08,892 --> 01:22:10,803
I made such a good impression on them.

1266
01:22:11,061 --> 01:22:12,062
Didn't you hear?

1267
01:22:12,129 --> 01:22:13,267
They called me a gem.

1268
01:22:14,231 --> 01:22:15,904
If you had barged in their home..

1269
01:22:15,966 --> 01:22:17,673
"They would've called you a thief.

1270
01:22:17,968 --> 01:22:20,346
Not a thief, a poor unfortunate guy.

1271
01:22:20,604 --> 01:22:22,743
All thieves are unfonunate.

1272
01:22:23,807 --> 01:22:25,809
Can I open one of these gifts? - No.

1273
01:22:25,909 --> 01:22:27,684
I have to return all this.

1274
01:22:28,111 --> 01:22:29,886
Well, legally half
of it belongs to me.

1275
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:34,060
And by the way,
I never saw anyone return gifts.

1276
01:22:35,852 --> 01:22:38,059
I love this track.

1277
01:22:38,388 --> 01:22:41,665
Can we hear it once
before you return it?

1278
01:22:55,572 --> 01:22:58,109
I do have a right
to a dance on New Year's.

1279
01:22:58,742 --> 01:22:59,743
May l'_2

1280
01:23:09,286 --> 01:23:10,788
Pink Chiffon..

1281
01:23:12,122 --> 01:23:12,896
Clown!

1282
01:23:14,257 --> 01:23:17,898
Years later,
when we think about this new year..

1283
01:23:18,028 --> 01:23:19,029
...we'll have a big laugh.

1284
01:23:19,162 --> 01:23:20,903
Yes, when you got up you said..

1285
01:23:20,964 --> 01:23:23,706
You're Dolly-Pauli right?
What are these flowers?

1286
01:23:26,269 --> 01:23:29,341
And you should've seen
your face when you fell down.

1287
01:23:29,573 --> 01:23:31,280
It was like this.

1288
01:23:31,341 --> 01:23:33,912
But the best was "Where's
my mama's crockery?"

1289
01:23:33,977 --> 01:23:35,388
"Where's my mama's crockery?"

1290
01:23:35,612 --> 01:23:36,613
very funny.

1291
01:23:36,813 --> 01:23:39,953
Yes, but no one sell's
mama's crockery on Ebay.

1292
01:23:40,817 --> 01:23:42,592
Can I ask something? - Yes.

1293
01:23:44,154 --> 01:23:48,125
Did you buy those Reindeer
shorts especially for Christmas?

1294
01:24:03,106 --> 01:24:04,244
Can I come in?

1295
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:18,055
Are you angnl?

1296
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,833
I won't yell at you anymore.

1297
01:24:31,701 --> 01:24:33,078
He's still here.

1298
01:24:36,439 --> 01:24:38,851
Oh..so you were listening
to music, I see.

1299
01:24:39,743 --> 01:24:40,949
Very nice.

1300
01:24:53,723 --> 01:24:55,760
I've switched off the music, happy?

1301
01:25:01,331 --> 01:25:02,742
Can we talk inside for a minute?

1302
01:25:09,172 --> 01:25:10,651
Why is he still here?

1303
01:25:11,074 --> 01:25:13,680
I am ready to hear this time.
- This time?

1304
01:25:13,843 --> 01:25:15,345
Stop making a scene, Tikku.

1305
01:25:15,712 --> 01:25:16,918
Tell me the reason, that's it.

1306
01:25:20,717 --> 01:25:22,355
He wanted to call Chicago.

1307
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:24,130
I told him he can call from here.

1308
01:25:24,721 --> 01:25:25,995
Has he finished calling? - Yes.

1309
01:25:26,089 --> 01:25:28,035
Good. Ask him to leave.

1310
01:25:28,658 --> 01:25:30,035
No! - Why?

1311
01:25:31,695 --> 01:25:34,369
Because he helped me when you left me.

1312
01:25:34,764 --> 01:25:36,072
Would you like to know how?

1313
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,146
Not at all.

1314
01:25:39,569 --> 01:25:41,242
Because all this is just a story.

1315
01:25:41,605 --> 01:25:42,913
Tell him to go.

1316
01:25:42,973 --> 01:25:44,008
Why?

1317
01:25:44,374 --> 01:25:46,752
Why should I always do what you want?

1318
01:25:49,246 --> 01:25:50,816
You don't want to send him away.

1319
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:53,326
Tikku, what's going
on between you two?

1320
01:25:53,383 --> 01:25:54,794
You tell me.
- lshaan, don'tstarl again.

1321
01:25:54,851 --> 01:25:55,591
Tell me.

1322
01:25:55,652 --> 01:25:56,756
Ishaan, you're huning me.

1323
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:59,733
Tell me. What's going
on between you two? - lshaan.

1324
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:01,728
Tell me. - Leave. Leave her.

1325
01:26:01,791 --> 01:26:02,792
Get out.

1326
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,331
Do you how much she
was crying after you left?

1327
01:26:07,797 --> 01:26:11,006
Forget it, Randhir.
- No, he'll have to apologize.

1328
01:26:11,067 --> 01:26:12,102
Say sorry.

1329
01:26:13,703 --> 01:26:14,807
Okay..you're right.

1330
01:26:14,871 --> 01:26:15,975
He's right. Okay.

1331
01:26:16,039 --> 01:26:16,779
Here's my 8P°I°9V-

1332
01:26:17,073 --> 01:26:18,017
Hey“

1333
01:26:19,242 --> 01:26:21,722
Doesn't apologize and also
ruined the kid's butterﬂies.

1334
01:26:21,778 --> 01:26:23,189
Come on, say sorry. - Here's my sorry.

1335
01:26:25,915 --> 01:26:30,295
I didn't tell you to hit me,
I told you to say sorry. - Really.

1336
01:26:30,353 --> 01:26:31,161
Say sorry.

1337
01:26:31,221 --> 01:26:33,929
Ishaan. - What are you doing?

1338
01:26:38,561 --> 01:26:40,097
You broke the window.

1339
01:26:40,163 --> 01:26:41,506
Ishaan.

1340
01:26:41,564 --> 01:26:43,100
You two messed my house.

1341
01:26:46,703 --> 01:26:47,875
You have to say sorry.

1342
01:26:47,937 --> 01:26:49,746
Come on, get up. - Randhir, stop it.

1343
01:26:49,873 --> 01:26:50,715
Come on.

1344
01:26:51,074 --> 01:26:52,576
Say, Tikku, I am sorry.

1345
01:26:52,642 --> 01:26:53,518
Tikku?

1346
01:26:53,677 --> 01:26:54,849
Earlier he was calling you Miss.

1347
01:26:54,911 --> 01:26:55,855
Now it's Tikku.

1348
01:26:56,079 --> 01:26:57,023
Stop it.

1349
01:26:57,147 --> 01:26:58,683
Randhir, stop it. - Leave my hand.

1350
01:26:58,748 --> 01:26:59,726
Please leave him.

1351
01:26:59,916 --> 01:27:00,758
Please?

1352
01:27:00,984 --> 01:27:03,692
Please leave him.
Please. - Fine, I'll leave him.

1353
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:05,258
Say sorry now.

1354
01:27:05,789 --> 01:27:07,029
Sorry my foot.

1355
01:27:07,991 --> 01:27:09,766
Ishaan. - Say sorry.

1356
01:27:14,597 --> 01:27:15,632
Say sorry.

1357
01:27:20,036 --> 01:27:23,745
Ma'am, is this yours? - Oh yes.

1358
01:27:23,807 --> 01:27:25,184
Is there a problem here?

1359
01:27:25,642 --> 01:27:27,121
No..no problem.

1360
01:27:27,177 --> 01:27:27,917
Everylhing is okay.

1361
01:27:29,045 --> 01:27:30,820
Hey..move!

1362
01:27:31,815 --> 01:27:33,954
Say.. - Hold it.

1363
01:27:34,851 --> 01:27:36,592
Why call the police?

1364
01:27:36,686 --> 01:27:37,528
I could've dealt with him.

1365
01:27:37,587 --> 01:27:39,726
Ma'am, are these guys bothering you?

1366
01:27:40,023 --> 01:27:41,195
Would you like to press charges?

1367
01:27:41,257 --> 01:27:42,861
Yeah, charge him.

1368
01:27:43,493 --> 01:27:45,063
Both of them. - Right?

1369
01:27:45,195 --> 01:27:46,299
Both.

1370
01:27:47,530 --> 01:27:49,134
Okay, put your hands behind your back.

1371
01:27:49,299 --> 01:27:50,539
Both of you.

1372
01:27:52,902 --> 01:27:54,643
I will never forget this New Year.

1373
01:27:54,804 --> 01:27:55,646
Move.

1374
01:27:58,007 --> 01:28:01,113
He staned the fight, but I am sorry.

1375
01:28:02,078 --> 01:28:03,853
Any problem, call us ma'am.

1376
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:10,825
Move.

1377
01:28:10,887 --> 01:28:11,922
Come on, move.

1378
01:28:11,988 --> 01:28:12,796
Get in, come on.

1379
01:28:12,989 --> 01:28:14,730
Move. Get in.

1380
01:28:15,024 --> 01:28:16,731
Get in there. Shut up.

1381
01:28:24,934 --> 01:28:26,538
Come on. Come on, get out of there.

1382
01:28:26,603 --> 01:28:27,638
Hurry UP-

1383
01:28:27,804 --> 01:28:28,839
Come on, ladies, move it.

1384
01:28:28,972 --> 01:28:30,645
Quit talking. Come on, move.

1385
01:28:31,007 --> 01:28:32,008
Come on.

1386
01:28:32,809 --> 01:28:33,913
What are you waiting for?

1387
01:28:34,043 --> 01:28:34,919
Come on.

1388
01:28:48,291 --> 01:28:49,065
What's that?

1389
01:28:49,626 --> 01:28:50,661
Keep this.

1390
01:28:52,896 --> 01:28:54,398
Alright. Thanks.

1391
01:28:59,636 --> 01:29:00,979
Come on, move. - Move out.

1392
01:29:01,104 --> 01:29:02,105
Move. Come on.

1393
01:29:02,338 --> 01:29:03,476
He's cute.

1394
01:29:04,541 --> 01:29:05,417
Okay, yes.

1395
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:20,399
My jail story is coming to an end.

1396
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:22,660
I am going home.

1397
01:29:26,329 --> 01:29:27,831
Won't you ask how?

1398
01:29:31,401 --> 01:29:32,709
Money.

1399
01:29:33,403 --> 01:29:36,111
If you've money, even/thing's clear.

1400
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:39,151
No need for money.

1401
01:29:39,776 --> 01:29:41,585
We'll be out in a while.

1402
01:29:43,446 --> 01:29:44,356
H ow?

1403
01:29:44,581 --> 01:29:45,992
Tikku will come bail us out.

1404
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:49,587
You're an expen on Tikku now.

1405
01:29:53,623 --> 01:29:55,899
Give me the money.
- Hey man, where's that money?

1406
01:29:56,125 --> 01:29:57,536
Give it to me.

1407
01:29:58,027 --> 01:29:59,131
Come on.

1408
01:30:00,029 --> 01:30:01,064
Where's the money?

1409
01:30:10,807 --> 01:30:11,979
Come on, slugger.

1410
01:30:36,466 --> 01:30:39,003
Even I like breaking faces!

1411
01:30:47,477 --> 01:30:50,014
What's going on here? - Nothing.

1412
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:51,156
Yeah, right.

1413
01:30:51,314 --> 01:30:52,725
Okay, you're free.

1414
01:30:52,882 --> 01:30:53,986
Let's go. You're out of here.

1415
01:30:54,050 --> 01:30:55,961
Let's go, move.
- Don't forget to say sorry.

1416
01:31:05,094 --> 01:31:06,129
Who cleared us both?

1417
01:31:06,262 --> 01:31:08,139
The lady from the house.
You should thank her.

1418
01:31:08,264 --> 01:31:10,107
Next time no brawling on New Year.

1419
01:31:13,036 --> 01:31:15,744
Hey, Gary, we need you over here.

1420
01:31:16,773 --> 01:31:17,410
Sorry.

1421
01:31:17,974 --> 01:31:18,850
Sorry?

1422
01:31:19,475 --> 01:31:20,977
For getting him out of jail again.

1423
01:31:21,411 --> 01:31:23,789
And sorry so that I forget
everylhing and forgive you.

1424
01:31:26,249 --> 01:31:28,126
We can discuss this in private.

1425
01:31:28,818 --> 01:31:29,728
Why?

1426
01:31:30,019 --> 01:31:32,499
Since last year this has
been a three-ringed circus.

1427
01:31:35,758 --> 01:31:36,498
Excuse me.

1428
01:31:39,362 --> 01:31:40,807
Ishaan, I am sorry..

1429
01:31:42,065 --> 01:31:45,308
I couldn't be the girl
that could make you happy.

1430
01:31:45,368 --> 01:31:46,870
Not just me..

1431
01:31:47,003 --> 01:31:48,914
You can't make anyone happy.

1432
01:31:51,007 --> 01:31:53,044
You like living alone.

1433
01:31:53,543 --> 01:31:55,489
You don't get along with families.

1434
01:31:55,845 --> 01:31:57,756
That's why everyone leaves you.

1435
01:31:58,114 --> 01:31:59,821
And I'm going too.

1436
01:32:00,116 --> 01:32:02,858
Because you and me are finished.

1437
01:32:28,144 --> 01:32:29,680
Shall I drop you home?

1438
01:32:48,031 --> 01:32:49,066
Here's the money.

1439
01:32:51,401 --> 01:32:53,176
And take this taxi to Chicago.

1440
01:32:57,206 --> 01:32:58,776
First I'll drop you home..

1441
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,846
...and then I'll go.

1442
01:33:14,157 --> 01:33:17,502
Tikku..should I go?

1443
01:33:34,343 --> 01:33:35,788
Excuse me, sir.

1444
01:33:37,013 --> 01:33:40,893
Sir..l got to go. - Yeah!

1445
01:33:43,252 --> 01:33:44,322
Thank you.

1446
01:34:10,046 --> 01:34:12,856
You see..l just got
out of a relationship.

1447
01:34:12,915 --> 01:34:14,417
I don't like to get into commitments.

1448
01:34:14,484 --> 01:34:16,930
What do you want to say?
You won't help me.

1449
01:34:19,822 --> 01:34:26,103
Now lshaan, you have to
wipe the tears behind that smile.

1450
01:34:26,162 --> 01:34:28,073
...and fill the void with a family.

1451
01:34:28,331 --> 01:34:30,038
Right, lshaan.

1452
01:34:30,266 --> 01:34:32,974
Won't you take good care of Tikku?

1453
01:35:02,865 --> 01:35:03,843
Randhir.

1454
01:35:06,569 --> 01:35:07,639
Why are you sitting here?

1455
01:35:09,238 --> 01:35:10,808
I left my keys in the house.

1456
01:35:11,007 --> 01:35:12,748
I am waiting for Vidya.

1457
01:35:14,510 --> 01:35:15,648
Here. - What's this?

1458
01:35:15,711 --> 01:35:17,816
Keys..one I used to get in.

1459
01:35:26,122 --> 01:35:27,601
Are these keys..or
a bundle of trouble?

1460
01:35:30,626 --> 01:35:31,570
Thank you.

1461
01:35:31,894 --> 01:35:33,771
See you there. - Bye.

1462
01:35:36,132 --> 01:35:37,202
Tikku.

1463
01:35:40,236 --> 01:35:42,216
If you ever come to Chicago,
do drop in.

1464
01:35:44,273 --> 01:35:45,843
I know the address.

1465
01:35:48,644 --> 01:35:50,123
BYe- - Bye.

1466
01:35:52,048 --> 01:35:53,584
Tikku.

1467
01:36:01,958 --> 01:36:04,632
Randhir, you're just
looking for excuses to stay.

1468
01:36:07,096 --> 01:36:10,202
Actually, I got clobbered all day.

1469
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:12,145
And no one offered me anything to eat.

1470
01:36:12,235 --> 01:36:14,146
And I am very hungry.

1471
01:36:15,304 --> 01:36:16,612
Will you eat?

1472
01:36:18,841 --> 01:36:19,785
Thanks.

1473
01:36:20,743 --> 01:36:24,156
Food and coffee at 4am. Great.

1474
01:36:25,681 --> 01:36:27,592
I made it to impress someone.

1475
01:36:28,985 --> 01:36:30,328
I am impressed.

1476
01:36:31,954 --> 01:36:34,798
I have an off today,
no hurry to go back to Chicago.

1477
01:36:34,924 --> 01:36:36,198
So I thought why don't
I go back in the evening.

1478
01:36:36,359 --> 01:36:40,000
I'll see New York today.
With you?

1479
01:36:40,129 --> 01:36:41,005
With me?

1480
01:36:41,731 --> 01:36:43,005
But I didn't invite you.

1481
01:36:43,799 --> 01:36:44,709
So do it now.

1482
01:36:44,767 --> 01:36:45,336
Why?

1483
01:36:49,906 --> 01:36:52,910
Why not? - Why should l?

1484
01:36:58,281 --> 01:36:59,316
Now you can invite me.

1485
01:37:00,249 --> 01:37:01,319
This will stay here.

1486
01:37:03,853 --> 01:37:05,890
At least let him
stay amongst the books.

1487
01:37:05,955 --> 01:37:06,865
No!

1488
01:37:07,223 --> 01:37:08,702
It will stay here.

1489
01:37:16,098 --> 01:37:16,872
Randhir.

1490
01:37:17,233 --> 01:37:18,143
Randhir.

1491
01:37:18,701 --> 01:37:20,044
What are you doing?

1492
01:37:21,437 --> 01:37:22,711
What did you say?

1493
01:37:23,072 --> 01:37:24,244
Why will you invite me?

1494
01:37:25,007 --> 01:37:26,077
I don't want to hear anylhing.

1495
01:37:26,375 --> 01:37:28,252
Randhir,
go down now and get that photo.

1496
01:37:29,378 --> 01:37:30,356
Never.

1497
01:37:31,047 --> 01:37:32,082
You won't go?

1498
01:37:33,249 --> 01:37:35,354
You know..you're audacious.

1499
01:37:36,285 --> 01:37:37,889
I did become this year..in New York.

1500
01:37:37,987 --> 01:37:40,331
In New York? - Yes.

1501
01:37:40,856 --> 01:37:43,928
You mean..l made you audacious. - Yes.

1502
01:37:44,393 --> 01:37:45,497
And I like it.

1503
01:37:46,062 --> 01:37:47,268
But I don't like it.

1504
01:37:47,697 --> 01:37:49,142
Go bring it back up now.

1505
01:37:50,833 --> 01:37:51,709
No?

1506
01:37:54,837 --> 01:37:56,908
Fine, you can lie
there..like shameless.

1507
01:37:56,973 --> 01:37:59,044
I'll go and get lshaan's photo.

1508
01:38:08,751 --> 01:38:11,197
If anythings stolen from my house,
I'll show you.

1509
01:38:11,253 --> 01:38:12,857
I know your address.

1510
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:32,675
Excuse me.

1511
01:38:32,808 --> 01:38:33,752
What are you doing?

1512
01:38:33,909 --> 01:38:34,910
Wait a minute?

1513
01:38:35,678 --> 01:38:36,349
Give me your foot.

1514
01:38:36,412 --> 01:38:38,722
Why? Did you work at a shoe-shop?

1515
01:38:38,981 --> 01:38:41,928
This often happened
when I used to get angry.

1516
01:38:42,084 --> 01:38:45,224
Give it a tug and it'll be fine.

1517
01:38:46,322 --> 01:38:49,064
It's okay if I go out in this cold,
but not you.

1518
01:38:49,358 --> 01:38:51,770
To get his photo, never.

1519
01:38:52,695 --> 01:38:53,935
Fine, stay here then.

1520
01:38:54,263 --> 01:38:55,241
Shameless.

1521
01:38:58,401 --> 01:39:05,876
"L wonder why..you dwell in my heart."

1522
01:39:06,275 --> 01:39:13,284
"Why did l..keep thinking about you?"

1523
01:39:13,649 --> 01:39:21,033
Your image keeps
floating in my eyes.

1524
01:39:21,157 --> 01:39:29,167
"My lips only mention your name."

1525
01:39:30,099 --> 01:39:32,010
"l want to hold your hands."

1526
01:39:32,068 --> 01:39:33,945
"..and keep walking for miles."

1527
01:39:34,003 --> 01:39:35,676
"Come to me."

1528
01:39:35,738 --> 01:39:37,775
"Come to me."

1529
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:41,686
As night spreads
across..it's hard to forget.

1530
01:39:41,744 --> 01:39:43,223
"Come to me."

1531
01:39:43,279 --> 01:39:45,350
"Come to me."

1532
01:39:45,414 --> 01:39:47,360
"l want to hold your hands."

1533
01:39:47,416 --> 01:39:49,259
"..and keep walking for miles."

1534
01:39:49,318 --> 01:39:50,922
"Come to me."

1535
01:39:50,986 --> 01:39:53,057
"Come to me."

1536
01:39:53,155 --> 01:39:56,967
The night spreads
across..it's hard to forget.

1537
01:39:57,026 --> 01:39:58,471
"Come to me."

1538
01:39:58,694 --> 01:40:01,197
"Come to me."

1539
01:40:08,304 --> 01:40:15,188
"l want to tell you.."

1540
01:40:15,911 --> 01:40:22,920
...things that I
didn't even tell God.

1541
01:40:24,587 --> 01:40:31,402
Your memoriessurround
me all the time.

1542
01:40:31,660 --> 01:40:38,009
"Since the time we met."

1543
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:46,046
"What is this all about?"

1544
01:40:46,108 --> 01:40:52,923
"Slumber's missing from my eyes."

1545
01:40:53,282 --> 01:41:01,292
"My eyes..are the witness."

1546
01:41:02,191 --> 01:41:04,102
"l want to hold your hands."

1547
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:06,037
"..and keep walking for miles."

1548
01:41:06,095 --> 01:41:07,802
"Come to me."

1549
01:41:07,863 --> 01:41:09,865
"Come to me."

1550
01:41:09,932 --> 01:41:13,744
As night spreads
across..it's hard to forget.

1551
01:41:13,802 --> 01:41:15,281
"Come to me."

1552
01:41:15,337 --> 01:41:17,715
"Come to me."

1553
01:41:25,181 --> 01:41:27,286
Hey..who are you?

1554
01:41:31,086 --> 01:41:33,032
You will break Tikku's umbrella.

1555
01:41:33,622 --> 01:41:34,965
If you want to break my head,
use this.

1556
01:41:35,224 --> 01:41:36,794
You know Tikku.

1557
01:41:39,295 --> 01:41:40,273
I know you too.

1558
01:41:41,063 --> 01:41:42,974
"L want to hold your hands."

1559
01:41:43,032 --> 01:41:44,909
"..and keep walking for miles."

1560
01:41:44,967 --> 01:41:46,571
"Come to me."

1561
01:41:46,635 --> 01:41:48,740
"Come to me."

1562
01:41:48,804 --> 01:41:52,650
The night spreads
across..it's hard to forget.

1563
01:41:52,708 --> 01:41:54,153
"Come to me."

1564
01:41:54,210 --> 01:41:56,349
"Come to me."

1565
01:41:56,579 --> 01:41:58,252
"l want to hold your hands."

1566
01:41:58,314 --> 01:42:00,225
"..and keep walking for miles."

1567
01:42:00,282 --> 01:42:01,955
"Come to me."

1568
01:42:02,017 --> 01:42:04,054
"Come to me."

1569
01:42:04,119 --> 01:42:07,965
The night spreads
across..it's hard to forget.

1570
01:42:08,023 --> 01:42:09,593
"Come to me."

1571
01:42:09,658 --> 01:42:12,571
"Come to me."

1572
01:42:19,335 --> 01:42:20,370
Yeah, we argued, but then"

1573
01:42:20,603 --> 01:42:21,911
...l just threw the photograph.

1574
01:42:22,004 --> 01:42:23,244
HaPPY New Year!

1575
01:42:23,305 --> 01:42:25,911
Happy New Year! - Hey, baby.

1576
01:42:26,141 --> 01:42:27,677
What a story, buddy?

1577
01:42:27,843 --> 01:42:30,016
Same house, same key..

1578
01:42:30,079 --> 01:42:31,752
This can happen only in New York.

1579
01:42:31,814 --> 01:42:33,851
And that too, on New Year.

1580
01:42:33,916 --> 01:42:34,986
Totally awesome, right?

1581
01:42:35,217 --> 01:42:38,391
But..you took so long to come up.

1582
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:46,203
Good job, Randhir.

1583
01:42:46,262 --> 01:42:47,707
I'll go meet Jas.

1584
01:42:52,668 --> 01:42:54,375
Isn't it great I found lshaan's..

1585
01:42:55,404 --> 01:42:56,712
Randhir!

1586
01:43:08,017 --> 01:43:09,087
Tikku.

1587
01:43:09,718 --> 01:43:10,696
Tikku.

1588
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:12,664
Why are you crying?

1589
01:43:12,721 --> 01:43:15,429
I hate you. I want you to go away.

1590
01:43:20,129 --> 01:43:21,164
You're lying.

1591
01:43:21,697 --> 01:43:22,437
I am lying?

1592
01:43:22,798 --> 01:43:23,776
Iam lying-

1593
01:43:24,066 --> 01:43:25,443
How do you know I am lying?

1594
01:43:25,668 --> 01:43:26,942
What do you know about me?

1595
01:43:27,202 --> 01:43:28,772
What do you know..

1596
01:43:34,209 --> 01:43:35,984
Why are you so shameless?

1597
01:43:38,180 --> 01:43:42,925
I've become one..since
I met you. - Why?

1598
01:43:42,985 --> 01:43:50,233
"L wonder why..you dwell in my heart."

1599
01:43:50,926 --> 01:43:57,935
"Why did l..keep thinking about you?"

1600
01:43:58,067 --> 01:44:05,747
Your image keeps
floating in my eyes.

1601
01:44:05,808 --> 01:44:12,123
"My lips only mention your name."

1602
01:44:12,414 --> 01:44:15,418
Before he breaks down the door,
I'll see who it is.

1603
01:44:15,684 --> 01:44:17,459
"L want to hold your hands."

1604
01:44:17,619 --> 01:44:19,257
"..and keep walking for miles."

1605
01:44:19,321 --> 01:44:20,959
"Come to me."

1606
01:44:21,023 --> 01:44:22,832
"Come to me."

1607
01:44:23,792 --> 01:44:25,066
It's me.

1608
01:44:26,261 --> 01:44:28,434
I am the one breaking down the door.

1609
01:44:32,334 --> 01:44:35,338
How can I go without
wishing you new year?

1610
01:44:37,072 --> 01:44:38,813
Happy New Year, baby.

1611
01:44:45,848 --> 01:44:46,383
Ishaan.

1612
01:44:46,782 --> 01:44:47,954
I can walk.

1613
01:45:00,996 --> 01:45:02,304
Excuse me.

1614
01:45:20,883 --> 01:45:22,191
Ishaan, what are you doing?

1615
01:45:23,719 --> 01:45:25,027
Taking a steam bath.

1616
01:45:26,789 --> 01:45:28,632
Please stop it, lshaan. Please.

1617
01:45:29,258 --> 01:45:33,832
You can say please 100 times,
but I won't stop.

1618
01:45:34,596 --> 01:45:35,939
Get out!

1619
01:45:37,032 --> 01:45:38,602
At least take off your coat.

1620
01:45:38,667 --> 01:45:41,773
I'll take my steam
bath with the coat on.

1621
01:45:41,904 --> 01:45:43,383
What do you care?

1622
01:45:43,839 --> 01:45:46,285
Mr..Waah-Waah!

1623
01:45:47,876 --> 01:45:51,187
Her new name. I kept it on New year.

1624
01:45:53,081 --> 01:45:55,357
What a great guy.

1625
01:45:56,018 --> 01:45:59,158
Every new year he goes to the gym.

1626
01:46:01,190 --> 01:46:05,730
At the gym, he drinks a
lot because he's getting married.

1627
01:46:06,795 --> 01:46:11,767
Then..they dump him..on a plane.

1628
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:15,347
And Mr. Waah-WaahJands
in another city.

1629
01:46:16,038 --> 01:46:18,245
And..

1630
01:46:24,079 --> 01:46:25,717
In the other city..

1631
01:46:27,416 --> 01:46:30,022
...he meets someone else.

1632
01:46:32,888 --> 01:46:36,028
He forgets his girl in Chicago.

1633
01:46:37,292 --> 01:46:40,967
...and settles down with
his new found love in Chicago.

1634
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:49,476
What are the thoughts of..

1635
01:46:49,872 --> 01:46:52,682
"The President of the Unlucky Club?

1636
01:46:56,378 --> 01:46:57,823
Good name, huh!

1637
01:46:59,715 --> 01:47:01,319
I gave her that.

1638
01:47:05,120 --> 01:47:08,897
Wherever she goes, bad luck follows.

1639
01:47:08,957 --> 01:47:09,958
Enough.

1640
01:47:10,959 --> 01:47:14,771
You can taunt me all you like,
nothing more.

1641
01:47:15,297 --> 01:47:16,367
0K8'!-

1642
01:47:18,367 --> 01:47:21,177
I can praise you, right?

1643
01:47:22,404 --> 01:47:23,439
Fair deal.

1644
01:47:25,307 --> 01:47:28,948
Tikku. Tikku. Tikku.

1645
01:47:30,913 --> 01:47:35,862
In this single night,
you can cross-off your past.

1646
01:47:36,385 --> 01:47:38,888
"But not make a future for yourself.

1647
01:47:39,154 --> 01:47:42,033
And not with a fraud.

1648
01:47:42,824 --> 01:47:45,100
The key fitted, my foot.

1649
01:47:46,128 --> 01:47:49,371
Have you ever heard
such a DUII-S*** story?

1650
01:47:56,939 --> 01:47:57,849
Ishaan!

1651
01:47:58,874 --> 01:48:00,820
Ishaan, don't go out. It's cold.

1652
01:48:01,910 --> 01:48:02,854
Ishaan!

1653
01:48:03,045 --> 01:48:04,080
Ishaan!

1654
01:48:04,746 --> 01:48:05,724
It's cold outside.

1655
01:48:05,914 --> 01:48:07,154
What if you catch pneumonia?

1656
01:48:07,215 --> 01:48:09,593
So what?

1657
01:48:10,552 --> 01:48:12,725
It'll be better than your company.

1658
01:48:14,523 --> 01:48:16,002
I'll stay myself out.

1659
01:48:38,647 --> 01:48:40,923
Randhir, please go.

1660
01:48:48,757 --> 01:48:50,259
I don't know what I am doing?

1661
01:48:50,759 --> 01:48:53,899
But I know this is all wrong.

1662
01:48:54,963 --> 01:48:56,874
Yesterday I was with someone else..

1663
01:48:57,265 --> 01:48:59,973
...and now I'm with. No!

1664
01:49:02,537 --> 01:49:05,848
If papa had been here, he would say..

1665
01:49:06,775 --> 01:49:09,312
"Tikku, you're wrong."

1666
01:49:09,745 --> 01:49:11,691
"No one likes a girl like that."

1667
01:49:12,180 --> 01:49:13,659
"No one."

1668
01:49:14,216 --> 01:49:17,720
I do. - But I don't.

1669
01:49:20,922 --> 01:49:22,026
Please go away.

1670
01:49:25,127 --> 01:49:26,333
I beg of you..

1671
01:49:27,262 --> 01:49:28,605
...please go away.

1672
01:49:30,732 --> 01:49:32,905
Don't say, please.

1673
01:49:34,603 --> 01:49:35,308
Please!

1674
01:50:02,531 --> 01:50:05,341
Fine..l am going now.

1675
01:50:07,469 --> 01:50:09,312
But I will wait for you.

1676
01:50:11,506 --> 01:50:15,511
I will wait until you don't come.

1677
01:50:16,311 --> 01:50:19,383
"What is this separation?"

1678
01:50:19,481 --> 01:50:22,655
"There are tears in my eyes."

1679
01:50:22,818 --> 01:50:29,133
My head's drowning.
So let it just drown.

1680
01:50:29,424 --> 01:50:32,564
"This happened for the first time."

1681
01:50:32,594 --> 01:50:35,734
"Why do I feel like.."

1682
01:50:36,198 --> 01:50:42,706
My head's drowning.
So let it just drown.

1683
01:50:46,908 --> 01:50:50,617
Passengers travelling
to Chicago on Flight AK-420..

1684
01:50:50,746 --> 01:50:52,316
...Is now ready for boarding.

1685
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:54,553
Please proceed to
Gate no.9 for check-in.

1686
01:50:56,351 --> 01:51:02,597
My hean prays..that
you're always happy.

1687
01:51:02,824 --> 01:51:08,866
"Ask yourself..what your hean wants."

1688
01:51:09,531 --> 01:51:15,777
"l know..what lies in your heart."

1689
01:51:16,004 --> 01:51:22,888
"Tell me..why are we separated?"

1690
01:51:23,411 --> 01:51:24,651
Tikku.

1691
01:51:28,617 --> 01:51:30,096
BYe- - Bye.

1692
01:51:31,987 --> 01:51:33,694
Tikku.

1693
01:51:36,358 --> 01:51:39,464
"One thing troubles me.."

1694
01:51:39,528 --> 01:51:42,737
"..whenever I think about you."

1695
01:51:42,798 --> 01:51:45,938
"Why did you get upset with me?"

1696
01:51:46,001 --> 01:51:48,948
"l wonder why we got separated."

1697
01:51:49,471 --> 01:51:52,645
"This happened for the first time."

1698
01:51:52,707 --> 01:51:55,881
"Why do I feel like.."

1699
01:51:56,011 --> 01:52:02,519
"That I fell in love with you."

1700
01:52:02,584 --> 01:52:05,793
I stan crying with
a smile on my lips.

1701
01:52:05,854 --> 01:52:09,097
I stan laughing
with tears in my eyes.

1702
01:52:09,157 --> 01:52:12,104
"And I say to myself."

1703
01:52:12,594 --> 01:52:19,603
What had to happen..has
already happened.

1704
01:52:21,469 --> 01:52:24,245
Randhir, you're looking
for excuses to stay back.

1705
01:52:56,538 --> 01:52:58,108
Are these keys or bunch of trouble?

1706
01:53:14,723 --> 01:53:16,896
Randhir.. Where were you all night?

1707
01:53:18,693 --> 01:53:22,573
I called..but your
phone was switched off.

1708
01:53:23,565 --> 01:53:25,101
Where were you?

1709
01:53:27,802 --> 01:53:30,282
I called Riya and she
said "Never call me again".

1710
01:53:30,338 --> 01:53:33,649
I came here and saw your
mom's crockery was broken.

1711
01:53:34,242 --> 01:53:35,619
Where were you?

1712
01:53:36,578 --> 01:53:37,318
New York.

1713
01:53:37,646 --> 01:53:38,317
N ew York?

1714
01:53:38,713 --> 01:53:40,659
How did you get to New York?

1715
01:53:42,017 --> 01:53:43,963
I had too much to
drink with my friends.

1716
01:53:44,352 --> 01:53:47,822
And they sent me to
New York instead of Romi.

1717
01:53:48,356 --> 01:53:49,596
Sent you?

1718
01:53:49,891 --> 01:53:52,371
You're not luggage
that they sent you there.

1719
01:53:52,827 --> 01:53:55,273
Papa, I've a headache.
I want to sleep.

1720
01:53:55,630 --> 01:53:59,305
Go inside and sleep.
- No, I'll sleep here.

1721
01:54:00,101 --> 01:54:03,014
Son, call up Riya.

1722
01:54:03,071 --> 01:54:05,017
Your headache will be cured.

1723
01:54:06,007 --> 01:54:07,918
Forget Riya, papa..

1724
01:54:08,810 --> 01:54:10,380
...she'll find someone better.

1725
01:54:11,579 --> 01:54:12,922
Someone better?

1726
01:54:13,048 --> 01:54:14,721
Until yesterday,
you were good enough for her.

1727
01:54:14,783 --> 01:54:15,955
What's wrong now?

1728
01:54:17,152 --> 01:54:18,654
There is someone else.

1729
01:54:20,322 --> 01:54:21,960
Someone else?

1730
01:54:23,325 --> 01:54:24,736
Someone else?

1731
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:26,403
Someone else in a single night.

1732
01:54:26,861 --> 01:54:27,999
You're become so audacious.

1733
01:54:28,263 --> 01:54:29,640
Someone else in a single night.

1734
01:54:29,764 --> 01:54:33,871
Papa, even she says
I've become audacious.

1735
01:54:36,271 --> 01:54:38,877
Son..

1736
01:54:40,842 --> 01:54:42,651
You look so sad.

1737
01:54:44,045 --> 01:54:45,080
Does it pain?

1738
01:54:45,180 --> 01:54:46,250
It pains, doesn't it?

1739
01:54:47,182 --> 01:54:49,856
My son's in love for the first time.

1740
01:54:50,852 --> 01:54:52,798
Tell me who the girl is.

1741
01:54:52,921 --> 01:54:54,195
At least tell me her name.

1742
01:55:02,364 --> 01:55:06,369
Dear, Tikku, I admit that
Chocobar is better than Orange Lolly.

1743
01:55:09,204 --> 01:55:10,410
You win, dear.

1744
01:55:11,306 --> 01:55:12,341
I promise that from now on..

1745
01:55:12,407 --> 01:55:16,082
...only Tikku will choose the
flavor of ice-cream in this house.

1746
01:55:18,046 --> 01:55:19,821
Love you, papa.

1747
01:55:27,856 --> 01:55:30,769
You're my one and only, my favorite.

1748
01:55:30,825 --> 01:55:33,965
So please,
don't forget to eat your veggies.

1749
01:55:37,098 --> 01:55:39,169
Love, P8P?'-

1750
01:55:58,019 --> 01:56:00,090
Your mom was my Ms. World!

1751
01:56:00,155 --> 01:56:02,726
But you even broke her record.

1752
01:56:02,957 --> 01:56:04,937
From today you're my Ms. Universe.

1753
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:07,037
Happy sixteenth binhday.

1754
01:56:07,228 --> 01:56:09,230
Love, P8P?'-

1755
01:56:41,062 --> 01:56:42,166
Dear, Tikku.

1756
01:56:43,031 --> 01:56:45,875
I never imagined I'll
get such a short-time.

1757
01:56:46,034 --> 01:56:47,604
...to write this last letter to you.

1758
01:56:48,203 --> 01:56:50,149
But the accident was so sudden..

1759
01:56:50,505 --> 01:56:53,281
...and even the Lord arrived
in a hurry to take us away.

1760
01:56:53,908 --> 01:56:55,546
But I said to Him..

1761
01:56:55,643 --> 01:56:57,247
"Wait a moment."

1762
01:56:57,579 --> 01:57:00,651
First let me make proper
arrangements for my Tikku.

1763
01:57:00,982 --> 01:57:02,222
"And then we'll leave."

1764
01:57:09,791 --> 01:57:10,963
But the Lord said..

1765
01:57:11,092 --> 01:57:12,969
"Don't give excuses of Tikku."

1766
01:57:13,228 --> 01:57:16,209
You won't find anyone smaner
than Tikku in this world.

1767
01:57:16,764 --> 01:57:18,675
"She's more sensible than you are."

1768
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,241
"She is perfect the way she is."

1769
01:57:21,836 --> 01:57:22,837
So I said..

1770
01:57:22,904 --> 01:57:26,613
Tikku's marriage..that's
my responsibility.

1771
01:57:26,908 --> 01:57:28,751
"Let me fulfill that."

1772
01:57:29,043 --> 01:57:29,987
But the Lord said..

1773
01:57:30,111 --> 01:57:32,523
"Now that's my responsibility."

1774
01:57:33,014 --> 01:57:35,790
I'll bring the boy to
Tikku and introduce them.

1775
01:57:35,950 --> 01:57:36,985
"Come on now."

1776
01:57:37,752 --> 01:57:38,526
And I said..

1777
01:57:38,620 --> 01:57:40,031
"L am coming."

1778
01:57:40,088 --> 01:57:43,126
"But how's the boy going to be?"

1779
01:57:44,025 --> 01:57:45,299
The Lord said.

1780
01:57:45,593 --> 01:57:47,334
"Gem."

1781
01:57:48,196 --> 01:57:52,770
Since Lord has taken guarantee,
I'll go happily, dear.

1782
01:57:53,868 --> 01:57:56,644
Love, P8P?'-

1783
01:58:00,842 --> 01:58:02,788
He'll be a gem.

1784
01:58:04,078 --> 01:58:05,682
'He's a gem.'

1785
01:58:09,784 --> 01:58:10,785
'Didn't you hear?'

1786
01:58:10,852 --> 01:58:12,058
'She called me a gem.'

1787
01:58:30,305 --> 01:58:32,046
Vidya.. - What? What? What?

1788
01:58:32,106 --> 01:58:33,813
I am going to Chicago. - Why?

1789
01:58:33,908 --> 01:58:35,251
Because God wants us to be one.

1790
01:58:35,710 --> 01:58:40,216
But I wanted you two
to be one even before God,

1791
01:58:40,815 --> 01:58:42,226
Hold on.

1792
01:58:44,319 --> 01:58:45,354
Hey, baby gm.

1793
01:58:46,721 --> 01:58:48,132
Come back victorious, roomie.

1794
01:58:53,928 --> 01:58:54,406
Your tea, miss.

1795
01:58:54,462 --> 01:58:55,372
HaPPY New Year!

1796
01:58:56,998 --> 01:58:58,341
I love New Years.

1797
02:00:00,595 --> 02:00:01,903
"Do you have any idea where you are?"

1798
02:00:03,564 --> 02:00:06,875
"309 West, 7A."

1799
02:00:07,001 --> 02:00:08,002
"My house."

1800
02:00:08,102 --> 02:00:10,207
"309 West, 7A is my house."

1801
02:00:12,740 --> 02:00:14,811
"Papa and I live here."

1802
02:00:56,551 --> 02:01:01,551
"l wonder why..you dwell in my heart."

1803
02:01:09,263 --> 02:01:14,263
Your image keeps
floating in my eyes.

1804
02:01:50,671 --> 02:01:52,981
"The key fitted, my foot."

1805
02:01:53,741 --> 02:01:56,779
Have you ever heard
such a DUII-S*** story?

1806
02:02:02,984 --> 02:02:05,555
"You can cross-off your past."

1807
02:02:06,220 --> 02:02:08,461
"but not make a
future for yourself.

1808
02:02:09,590 --> 02:02:12,469
"And not with a fraud."

1809
02:03:03,044 --> 02:03:04,148
Tikku!

1810
02:03:13,855 --> 02:03:15,095
Tikku!

1811
02:03:17,024 --> 02:03:17,593
Sorry.

1812
02:03:17,658 --> 02:03:19,695
Young man, you should
be running through the park..

1813
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:21,034
"Not the sidewalk.

1814
02:03:21,562 --> 02:03:22,905
That's right. Thank you.

1815
02:03:51,292 --> 02:03:52,669
Randhir, stop.

1816
02:03:55,796 --> 02:03:56,831
Randhir.

1817
02:04:08,376 --> 02:04:09,855
You were leaving without meeting me.

1818
02:04:10,077 --> 02:04:11,579
I went to your house.

1819
02:04:12,980 --> 02:04:14,391
"But there was no one.

1820
02:04:15,883 --> 02:04:19,092
Same address,
same building, same street.

1821
02:04:20,021 --> 02:04:21,125
"But the key was wrong.

1822
02:04:23,157 --> 02:04:25,262
Like I am wrong..for you.

1823
02:04:25,326 --> 02:04:30,036
"L wonder why..you dwell in my heart."

1824
02:04:30,164 --> 02:04:31,199
Randhir.

1825
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:33,938
What are you doing?

1826
02:04:34,135 --> 02:04:35,113
Randhir.

1827
02:04:40,308 --> 02:04:47,920
Your image keeps
floating in my eyes.

1828
02:04:48,049 --> 02:04:56,127
"My lips only mention your name."

1829
02:04:56,924 --> 02:04:58,870
"l want to hold your hands."

1830
02:04:58,926 --> 02:05:00,769
"..and keep walking for miles."

1831
02:05:00,828 --> 02:05:02,307
"Come to me."

1832
02:05:02,363 --> 02:05:04,434
"Come to me."

1833
02:05:04,665 --> 02:05:08,340
As night spreads
across..it's hard to forget.

1834
02:05:08,402 --> 02:05:10,075
"Come to me."

1835
02:05:10,137 --> 02:05:11,343
"Come to me."

1836
02:05:11,672 --> 02:05:12,446
Randhir, leave me.

1837
02:05:12,807 --> 02:05:14,150
Let me go.

1838
02:05:14,241 --> 02:05:15,845
I don't want to see.
I don't want to hear anylhing.

1839
02:05:15,910 --> 02:05:17,947
I've already checked the key.
- Listen to me.

1840
02:05:18,346 --> 02:05:20,758
One second. - You're lying.

1841
02:05:20,815 --> 02:05:23,091
Left was your house, and..

1842
02:05:23,818 --> 02:05:24,796
Right.

1843
02:05:27,188 --> 02:05:28,189
There.

1844
02:05:35,830 --> 02:05:36,900
Randhir.

1845
02:05:38,699 --> 02:05:39,871
Forgive me.

1846
02:05:42,670 --> 02:05:43,648
I am sorry.

1847
02:05:46,741 --> 02:05:49,915
Actually, I don't trust my fate.

1848
02:05:50,845 --> 02:05:52,847
I am the President
of the Unlucky Club.

1849
02:05:52,913 --> 02:05:54,256
Don't say that.

1850
02:05:55,149 --> 02:05:57,129
You're the President
of the Lucky Club.

1851
02:06:00,821 --> 02:06:01,697
Come on, let's go in.

1852
02:06:07,395 --> 02:06:09,397
This is just like my house.

1853
02:06:13,901 --> 02:06:15,903
Oh..so they are your Dolly-Pauli?

1854
02:06:18,973 --> 02:06:20,384
Just like my home.

1855
02:06:21,308 --> 02:06:22,309
M'! Photo.

1856
02:06:22,376 --> 02:06:23,684
Where did you get it?

1857
02:06:23,911 --> 02:06:24,912
I stole it.

1858
02:06:26,013 --> 02:06:27,686
You're caught red-handed.

1859
02:06:29,183 --> 02:06:30,958
Where's papa? - Papa.

1860
02:06:31,218 --> 02:06:32,959
He's gone to see the house? - Why?

1861
02:06:33,888 --> 02:06:36,232
Now that you're here,
he'll be here too.

1862
02:06:39,660 --> 02:06:41,333
Happy New Year, uncle!

1863
02:06:41,696 --> 02:06:45,337
Bless you. Bless you. <i>Bless</i> you.

1864
02:06:45,399 --> 02:06:48,175
Uncle..is Randhir in?

1865
02:06:49,236 --> 02:06:50,237
Why?

1866
02:06:50,871 --> 02:06:52,179
Where else can he be?

1867
02:06:52,940 --> 02:06:53,315
Tell me.

1868
02:06:53,441 --> 02:06:54,715
Where?

1869
02:06:54,942 --> 02:06:56,785
New York!

1870
02:06:58,779 --> 02:06:59,849
Come in, you apes.

1871
02:06:59,914 --> 02:07:01,450
Now you know where
your Boarding Pass went.

1872
02:07:01,682 --> 02:07:03,025
Come in, you apes.

1873
02:07:03,084 --> 02:07:03,994
Mischievous kids.

1874
02:07:04,051 --> 02:07:05,724
Uncle, this. - Yeah, fine.

1875
02:07:05,786 --> 02:07:06,764
Come in.

1876
02:07:10,057 --> 02:07:11,127
Hello, Randhir.

1877
02:07:12,026 --> 02:07:13,972
Sister-in-law, Happy New Year.

1878
02:07:14,829 --> 02:07:16,103
You're smiling at us.

1879
02:07:16,263 --> 02:07:19,472
I guess you forgave Randhir
for yesterday's incident.

1880
02:07:19,700 --> 02:07:20,701
Thank God.

1881
02:07:21,736 --> 02:07:24,307
Hello..say thank you to sister-in-law.

1882
02:07:24,739 --> 02:07:26,116
Thank you. - Thank you so much

1883
02:07:26,173 --> 02:07:29,916
From today..l swear
I won't touch alcohol.

1884
02:07:29,977 --> 02:07:32,116
Sure? - Of course,
we won't even smell it.

1885
02:07:32,313 --> 02:07:35,886
You should be ashamed.

1886
02:07:36,050 --> 02:07:39,759
Buffoons, don't start the
first day of the year with a lie.

1887
02:07:39,820 --> 02:07:40,389
Sorry.

1888
02:07:40,454 --> 02:07:41,728
Papa..

1889
02:07:42,123 --> 02:07:43,295
Papa.

1890
02:07:43,891 --> 02:07:44,961
Tikku.

1891
02:07:45,459 --> 02:07:46,460
Hello, uncle.

1892
02:07:50,498 --> 02:07:52,500
Tikku!

1893
02:07:53,367 --> 02:07:54,437
Who's Tikku?

1894
02:07:54,869 --> 02:07:57,372
Romi, who's Tikku? - I don't know.

1895
02:07:57,738 --> 02:08:01,584
Lord has already given
you the keys to this house.

1896
02:08:01,675 --> 02:08:02,915
We just need to welcome you.

1897
02:08:02,977 --> 02:08:04,820
Welcome, dear.

1898
02:08:04,845 --> 02:08:05,846
Welcome.

1899
02:08:08,282 --> 02:08:11,820
Till yesterday sister-in-laws
name was Riya.

1900
02:08:11,886 --> 02:08:12,864
Yeah.

1901
02:08:13,020 --> 02:08:14,897
We had double pegs for Double R.

1902
02:08:15,189 --> 02:08:16,395
So who's Tikku?

1903
02:08:16,657 --> 02:08:17,635
I don't know.

1904
02:08:17,858 --> 02:08:20,771
But I know one of them is Randhir.

1905
02:08:21,695 --> 02:08:23,697
I want to thank my
mischievous friends.

1906
02:08:24,198 --> 02:08:25,905
If they weren't so drunk..

1907
02:08:25,966 --> 02:08:29,140
...and made me drink too, then
I would've never landed in New York.

1908
02:08:29,270 --> 02:08:31,750
And I would've never found
the same building, same lane..

1909
02:08:31,939 --> 02:08:33,941
...and same house and
a girl in that house.

1910
02:08:34,008 --> 02:08:36,215
“With whom I am really happy today.

1911
02:08:36,277 --> 02:08:38,257
I am happy too.

1912
02:08:38,512 --> 02:08:40,150
HaPPY New Year!

1913
02:08:40,447 --> 02:08:41,482
Same to you.

1914
02:08:41,549 --> 02:08:43,392
Many, many congratulations, sir.

1915
02:08:43,617 --> 02:08:45,961
"Love is sweeter than jaggery."

1916
02:08:46,020 --> 02:08:48,091
"Love is sweeter than jaggery."
