1
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,789
No one would have believed
in the early years of the 21 st century...

2
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,878
...that our world was being watched
by intelligences greater than our own...

3
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,272
...that as men busied themselves
about their various concerns...

4
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,157
...they observed and studied...

5
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,837
...the way a man with a microscope
might scrutinise

6
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,239
the creatures that swarm
and multiply in a drop of water.

7
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,473
With infinite complacency,
men went to and fro about the globe...

8
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,552
...confident of our empire
over this world.

9
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,197
Yet across the gulf of space,

10
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,599
intellects vast and cool
and unsympathetic...

11
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,395
...regarded our planet
with envious eyes...

12
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,357
...and slowly and surely...

13
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,950
...drew their plans against us.

14
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,394
Tell him to send it over
to the cargo shed.

15
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,511
It's on its way.

16
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,154
Ray.

17
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,517
Ferrier. Whoa.

18
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,077
I need you back in four instead of 12.
I got half of Korea coming in at noon.

19
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,556
No, no, no, I can't.
I'm on a 12-hour blow. Call Tedesco.

20
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,558
Come on. Tedesco can't move
40 containers in an hour.

21
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,830
I gotta have somebody
who can do double picks.

22
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,271
I wish I could help you, Sal.
It's the goddamn union regulations.

23
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,550
Come on.
I'm in a position here, Ray.

24
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,752
You remember
the union regulations, Sal.

25
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,031
You know what your problem is?

26
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,232
I can think of a couple women
who'd be happy to tell you.

27
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,717
8:30? Did we say that?

28
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,717
We said 8:00.

29
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,356
Hey, this is...

30
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,592
This is one safe-Iooking new vehicle
you got yourself here, Tim.

31
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,030
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

32
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,517
Eight o'clock, huh?

33
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,999
We'll be back by 9:30 on Sunday,
depending on the traffic.

34
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,239
There he is.

35
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,159
Get a hug?

36
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,910
Confusing handshake?
Kick in the teeth?

37
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,635
The door's locked.

38
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,799
Still working on those manners?

39
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,319
Hello, Dad.

40
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,112
Hello, Rachel.

41
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,352
Yo, Stan, hurry up.
We gotta get to work.

42
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,918
Here, honey. Let me
give you a hand getting that inside.

43
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,758
- The door's locked.
- Sweetheart, let me get it.

44
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,111
- I don't mind. I don't mind.
- Hey, she said she could get it.

45
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,753
- It's heavy.
- She said she could get it.

46
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,393
It's got rollers. Just roll it, roll it.

47
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,955
Yeah, but we can't roll it
up the stairs, can we?

48
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,390
Really, I got it from here, okay?

49
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,312
It's a 302 V8. It's...

50
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,711
It's gonna be out of here next week.

51
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,839
You better get going, you wanna
beat the traffic, don't you think?

52
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,832
You're out of milk.

53
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,988
And everything else.

54
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,796
Yeah.
Could you close the door, please?

55
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,594
Because that's my refrigerator.

56
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,634
I'm gonna go wait outside.

57
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,794
Okay, sweetheart.
I'll see you in a few days.

58
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,913
Bye, Tim.

59
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,877
- I better get this upstairs.
- Let me... Let me get...

60
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,313
- Mom, Mom, Mom.
- Mary Ann...

61
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,080
- Okay, okay.
- Mom, Mom.

62
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,432
A little old to still be sharing,
aren't they?

63
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,712
- I don't hear any complaints.
- No, I do.

64
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,592
Robbie's got a paper on the French
occupation of Algeria due Monday,

65
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,472
which he's yet to begin.

66
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,716
It would be nice if he were done
by the time we got back

67
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,514
so we don't have to keep
him up all night on Sunday.

68
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,358
- I just gotta type it up.
- No.

69
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,438
- You just gotta start writing it first.
- I love you, Mom.

70
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,672
I love you.

71
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,913
Listen to your father.

72
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,394
Oh, no shoes on the bed.

73
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,550
We'll be at my parents' house
in Boston,

74
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,557
but don't call the house line,
you know, they...

75
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,149
Well, the point is, I've got my cell
phone, so if anything comes up

76
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,873
or you have any questions,
just call me.

77
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,798
Believe it or not, I can handle it.

78
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,672
- I'll leave the phone on.
- Mary Ann.

79
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,430
It's a good look for you.

80
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,953
You think?

81
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,198
Yeah.

82
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,955
Take care of our kids.

83
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,351
Mary Ann,
you got nothing to worry about.

84
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,792
Listen, you tell your mom that
Ray sends his love and kisses.

85
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,160
Right. She'll love that.

86
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,713
The Ukraine,
a country of some 52 million people,

87
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,797
is in almost total blackness tonight,

88
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,116
in the wake of a series
of freakish lightning storms

89
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,912
of catastrophic proportion,

90
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,918
which struck the country at
approximately 4 a.m. Local time.

91
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,195
EMP, or electromagnetic pulse,
which causes a temporary interruption

92
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,914
of all electrical current
within its field.

93
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,192
As in the Ukraine, there are
scattered reports that the EMP here

94
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,676
was followed by seismic activity
on the scale of an earthquake,

95
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,509
measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale.
This...

96
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,069
- Baseball seasors over.
- Five minutes. It's not gonna kill you.

97
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,388
There he is.

98
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,712
Boston.

99
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,478
That's how it is?

100
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,398
Is that how it's gonna be?

101
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,635
- Careful with that throw.
- Whatever, Ray.

102
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,873
Mom says you got
a report due on Monday,

103
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,672
so you're gonna work on that
when we're done.

104
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,677
Yeah, I'm almost finished.
I just gotta type it up.

105
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,998
Yeah, bullshit.

106
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,913
Yeah? What do you know, Ray?

107
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,794
Everything. Havert you heard?
Between me and my brother,

108
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,672
we know everything.

109
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,638
What's the capital of Australia?

110
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,229
That's one my brother knows.

111
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,309
Okay with you if I just laugh the first
500 times you tell that one?

112
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,992
Just do your report. We don't send
you to school so you can flunk out.

113
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,230
You don't pay for it, Tim does.

114
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,632
That's half what I've got.

115
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,833
You're an asshole.
I hate coming here.

116
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,999
That why you act like such a dick?

117
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,634
What?

118
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,435
That's not how you're gonna
get through to him.

119
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,918
- If you want him to listen to you...
- What are you, your mother or mine?

120
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,755
- Where you going?
- I'm going to sleep, you know?

121
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,188
I work for a living.

122
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,635
- What are we supposed to eat?
- You know, order.

123
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,233
Three and two...

124
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,276
- Electromagnetic storm...
- The storms were tracked...

125
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,473
Oh, and I'll have my own little secret.
Good idea, eh, Gary?

126
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,750
- No.
- Oh, what do you know?

127
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,712
You're a snail.

128
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,314
What's the matter?

129
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,351
- Got a splinter.
- Oh?

130
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,397
Where'd you get it? Come here.

131
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,598
On your porch railing.

132
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,110
Do you need me to...? What?
To do what? You want me to...?

133
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,559
- You want me to take that out?
- Absolutely not.

134
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,991
Come here.
Let me see it. Let me see.

135
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,519
Dad.

136
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,358
- Just look. Don't touch it. Dad.
- Rach.

137
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,314
- I can't. You're moving it around.
- Okay, don't touch it. Just look at it.

138
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,599
It's gonna get infected.

139
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,438
- No, it won't.
- Yes, it's gonna get infected.

140
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,153
No, it won't.

141
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,268
When it's ready,
my body will just push it out.

142
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,150
- Push it out, huh?
- I read that.

143
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,152
You should get TiVo.

144
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,678
- Tim got it for my room.
- TiVo?

145
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,029
It's awesome.

146
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,680
I can watch all my shows
after homework.

147
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,429
Yeah, I'll just put it
on my platinum card.

148
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,993
Robbie?

149
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,633
Robbie.

150
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,198
What is that?

151
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,913
Hummus.

152
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,119
- Hummus?
- From the health-food place.

153
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,830
Kept one of their menus
last time we were here.

154
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,957
You said order.

155
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,597
I meant order food.

156
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,113
Where is Robbie?

157
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,550
- He went out.
- Out where?

158
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,957
I don't know.
He just took your car and left.

159
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,355
Who said that? Who's there?

160
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,551
It's the clam burglar.

161
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,399
Steven, look at this.

162
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,034
- What's up?
- Check it out!

163
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,788
You ever see something like that?

164
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,389
Springtime, maybe.
Not this time of year.

165
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,273
Come on, we can see better
from the back yard.

166
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,436
You gotta come see this!

167
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,993
- That is so weird.
- What?

168
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,516
The wind is blowing
toward the storm.

169
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,597
That is weird.

170
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,678
Hey, watch it!

171
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,273
Rachel,
you wanna see something cool?

172
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,593
It's okay.

173
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,951
- I wanna go inside.
- It's okay.

174
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,878
I wanna go inside.

175
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,152
Okay, you go ahead.

176
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,310
That's enough weather for me.

177
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,990
Don't wanna go by myself.

178
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,873
It's kind of fun, isn't it?

179
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,674
- No.
- Come on, like the Fourth of July.

180
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,471
- No, it's not.
- O, say can...

181
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,798
It's okay. You're fine.

182
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,309
- It hit right behind our house.
- Yeah, well, it's...

183
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,192
It's not gonna hit there again, okay,

184
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,790
because lightning doesn't strike
twice in the same place. Oh, shit!

185
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,072
Where's Robbie?

186
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,959
I don't know.

187
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,151
Is Robbie okay?

188
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,998
Are you okay?

189
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,031
Where's the thunder?

190
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,391
Why won't it stop?

191
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,313
Is it over?

192
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,308
Where are you going?

193
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,274
Just... I'm just checking things out.
Just wait... Wait there.

194
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,948
- Are we gonna be okay?
- I don't know.

195
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,116
- You don't know?
- No, I meant, I just... Just...

196
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,878
Rachel, please.

197
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,436
Just stop asking so many questions.
Just wait here.

198
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,710
Turn everything off.

199
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,831
Everything is off.

200
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,271
I can't get one freaking thing
to turn on.

201
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,878
You believe this, Ray?
Every single car.

202
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,397
Oh, Jesus. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

203
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,397
- The car just stopped, and...
- You're okay?

204
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,194
- Are you okay? You all right?
- The lightning started to hit.

205
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,356
- And me and this other guy...
- Where the hell did you go?

206
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,949
- Over on Lincoln Avenue.
- Lincoln Avenue?

207
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,479
- By the church.
- You saw the lightning?

208
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,750
Yeah, 26 times we counted,
over and over again.

209
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,633
The lightning started to hit.
It opened up this hole or something...

210
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,592
- Twenty-six times?
- Yeah.

211
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,908
- You're okay?
- Yeah.

212
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,156
Good. All right, well,
your sister is in the house,

213
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,432
and I want you to go in that house
and I want you to stay with her, okay?

214
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,269
The next time you take my car with
no driver's license and no permission,

215
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,959
I call the cops.

216
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,076
You better be there when I get back.

217
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,751
- Yeah.
- Robbie.

218
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,353
Manny, Manny.
Manny, what is it, dead?

219
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,188
All of them. Everything.
Look at this.

220
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,471
- The starter's fried.
- Lightning hit it?

221
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,671
Not even close.
I thought if I changed it...

222
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,270
- Any idea what's going on?
- I'm on my way to find out.

223
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,436
Try changing the solenoid.
It's probably fried.

224
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,200
Right, that's what I said.
I told you that. The solenoid.

225
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,156
Hey, they're saying all the
lightning struck down by the church.

226
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,833
What the hell is going on
around here?

227
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,195
- Let us through.
- Hey.

228
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,594
- Let us through here.
- Hey.

229
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,358
What up, Ray?

230
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,152
I should've known
you two were behind this.

231
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,316
Hey, God's pissed off at the
neighbourhood, Raymond.

232
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,112
- I'll tell you that much.
- You see it?

233
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,550
- You got power where you are?
- Nope. Nothing.

234
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,113
It's the cars, though.
That's the thing.

235
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,117
Solar flare. That's what
this guy told me he heard.

236
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,073
- A solar flare?
- The sun shoots off big blobs of plasma.

237
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,840
They turn into solar flares.
It's the only thing that can kill

238
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,951
- all the electronic stuff.
- Can I tell you something?

239
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,388
The sun does not cause lightning.

240
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,477
- I'm telling you what that guy said.
- I understand,

241
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,113
but it just sounds dumb
when you say...

242
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,159
I never seen anything like this before.

243
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,112
That many strikes of lightning
in one spot?

244
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,432
- Is this the only place?
- Come on, put that down.

245
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,631
- You wanna step back, please?
- Step back.

246
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,956
- You're gonna fall in.
- Get back.

247
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,594
Back up, people.
People, back up back there.

248
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,038
Move back. Everybody back up.

249
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,719
Move back.

250
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,758
Move back.

251
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,468
- Is it hot?
- Back up.

252
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,318
- No.
- Back up.

253
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,158
- It's freezing.
- What is that?

254
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,239
Oh, wait. Move. You feel that?

255
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,398
- I feel that.
- Hey, Bobby, come check this out.

256
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,194
- You feel that?
- Feel that?

257
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,992
- Yeah, I feel that.
- What is it, the subway?

258
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,031
- There's no subway here.
- F train, maybe?

259
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,628
That can't be the water main.

260
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,068
There's nothing else down there.

261
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,838
- Water main doesn't run through here.
- Feel that?

262
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,712
There's something down there
and it's moving.

263
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,835
Everybody move back.

264
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,031
Whoa. Back it up. Come on.

265
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,279
Let's go.

266
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,428
Come on, folks. Back up.
Get back.

267
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,838
Help me out here. Get back.

268
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,958
- Go! Move!
- Everybody get out of the way!

269
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,833
Everyone back up!
Everyone clear the intersection!

270
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,919
Get out of the way! Back up!
Back up! Get out of the way!

271
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,352
- Forget it! Get back!
- Get the hell out of the street!

272
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,598
Move away!

273
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,633
Come on, we gotta
clear this area now!

274
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,478
That's my car!

275
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,999
Go, go.

276
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,270
Get the hell out of here!

277
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,237
Oh, my God!

278
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,275
Come on, people! Let's go!

279
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,118
Come on, back up!

280
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,754
Please! Move back!

281
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,159
Watch it!

282
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,318
Oh, my God.

283
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,990
Ray, no. Stay, man.

284
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,391
Just stay.

285
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,388
- Just stay back here. Stay back!
- Wow.

286
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,548
Come on.

287
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,271
What happened?

288
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,912
What's going on?

289
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,672
Dad, what's the matter?

290
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,876
What's all that stuff all over you?

291
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,993
- Ray.
- What's all this stuff?

292
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,474
Hello?

293
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,593
Ray?

294
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,396
We're leaving this house
in 60 seconds.

295
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,591
What? Why?
I have no idea what's going on.

296
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,189
All the food from the refrigerator
and the cupboard, put it in here.

297
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,436
- What's going on? Just tell me.
- Just do it.

298
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,389
- Rachel, sweetheart...
- Dad, you're really scaring me.

299
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,716
- I need you to get your suitcase,
- Dad.

300
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,275
The one that you brought,
and bring it to me, okay?

301
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,756
Can you just do that for me, darling?
Okay?

302
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,273
I don't think it's a fire.

303
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,073
- See? That looks like smoke to me.
- What's happening?

304
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,837
I can't tell you now.
We've only got about another minute.

305
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,918
Please.

306
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,593
Please.

307
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,590
- Just keep it down.
- Ray, I'm standing right beside you.

308
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,870
Can you please answer me?

309
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,431
Just get in the front seat, Robbie.

310
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,759
- Whose car is this?
- Just get in.

311
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,678
Whose car is this?

312
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,635
Hey. Hey, Ray.
You were absolutely right.

313
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,229
That is exact...
I had to change the solen...

314
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,157
Ray? Hey.

315
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,590
Hey, Ray? Ray.

316
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,198
Ray.

317
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,519
What...? Come on, open up.

318
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,233
Open the door, come on.

319
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,635
Open the door, Ray.
What are you...?

320
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,512
- Get in, Manny.
- You gotta get out of the car.

321
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,597
- Get in the car.
- It's not my car. It's not your car.

322
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,995
- Manny, Manny, shut up.
- Daddy's acting crazy.

323
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,918
You can't do this.
Guy's gonna come back and...

324
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,678
Manny, Manny,
I don't have time to...

325
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,313
You're busting my chops.
I got a shop to run.

326
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,589
- Manny, listen to me.
- No, Ray.

327
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,392
Get in, Manny, or you're gonna die.

328
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,554
- What do you mean?
- Okay.

329
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,592
All right, get out of the truck. I'm not
kidding now. Get out of the car, Ray.

330
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,518
I'm not gonna get in.
I'm not getting in.

331
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,154
- Manny, get in with us.
- I'm not gonna get in trouble.

332
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,511
- Look, I'm not fooling around...
- Close the door, Robbie. Close it.

333
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,756
Ray, bring the car back, Ray.
It's not my car.

334
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,715
Get down!
Get down, get down! Get down!

335
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,114
Is it the terrorists?

336
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,709
- Just get down. Get down! Get down!
- Holy shit!

337
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,836
- Where are we going?
- We gotta go.

338
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,951
We got, maybe, like,
the only working car around here.

339
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,799
- I'm not stopping until we're clear of it.
- Clear of what?

340
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,319
- We gotta go.
- What's going on?

341
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,670
- Look, you saw, we're under attack!
- By who?!

342
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,074
Who is attacking us?!

343
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,840
Rachel? Rachel,
you've gotta keep it down.

344
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,190
Rachel. Rachel. Shut up, Rachel.

345
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,870
- You're freaking her out!
- Look, I'm driving! Do something!

346
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,275
Okay, put them up, Rach.
Make the arms.

347
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,074
This space right here, this is yours.
This belongs to you, right?

348
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,508
- Yes.
- You're safe in your space.

349
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,073
- I'm safe.
- You're safe in your space.

350
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,633
Nothing can happen to you
in your space.

351
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,229
Okay. I'm gonna go to the front seat,
I'm gonna talk to Dad.

352
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,555
- No.
- I'll be 2 feet away.

353
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,079
- Okay.
- Will you hold my hand?

354
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,429
- Will you hold my hand?
- Yes.

355
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,358
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yes.

356
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,156
I wanna know everything you know.

357
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,194
This...

358
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,072
This machine,
it crawled out of the ground,

359
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,477
started torching everything.
It was killing everybody.

360
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,240
What is it? Is it terrorists?

361
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,908
No, this came
from someplace else.

362
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,715
- What do you mean, like, Europe?
- No, Robbie, not like Europe!

363
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,119
That machine,

364
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,392
it was already buried.

365
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,718
Maybe it...

366
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,078
...it came down in the lightning storm.

367
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,629
- They came down in a lightning storm.
- What do you mean, came down?

368
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,195
- You said it was buried.
- No, the machine I'm talking about

369
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,472
was buried, but what
came down in the lightning storm,

370
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,672
what operates it,

371
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,348
that's the... You know.

372
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,669
- The what?
- That's...

373
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,269
Why aren't there any helicopters
or airplanes?

374
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,789
- It's the what?
- Hey, Rach. How you doing?

375
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,228
- How is she doing?
- How you doing?

376
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,395
- Fine.
- She's good.

377
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,512
- Good. What was that thing you did?
- Works sometimes.

378
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,392
- She gets claustrophobic.
- Yeah? Hey, Rachel?

379
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,272
- I want Mom.
- Yeah, I know. You feel better?

380
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,438
- I want Mom.
- Yeah? Tell me about it, you know?

381
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,959
- Take me to Mom's.
- What I need is,

382
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,310
I just need you to hold it together
for me, okay?

383
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,555
I want Mom!

384
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,591
When you start screaming,
I can't really drive...

385
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,199
- Take me to Mom's!
- I know that.

386
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,073
- That's where we're going, Rachel.
- Take me to Mom's!

387
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,111
I know!

388
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,871
Hurry up, Dad. Come on.

389
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,437
Robbie, get the door.

390
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,878
Mom!

391
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,479
- Mom!
- Mom!

392
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,398
Mom!

393
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,958
Mom? Tim?

394
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,793
Mom? Tim?

395
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,113
- Mom?
- Mom?

396
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,357
- Tim?!
- Tim?

397
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,271
Tim?

398
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,632
Mom?

399
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,394
They're gone.

400
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,397
Is she dead?

401
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,397
She's not dead. All right?

402
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,828
She's just not here, okay?

403
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,474
- They were never here.
- How do you know?

404
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,716
Because they're
on their way to Boston.

405
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,717
And so they just...

406
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,434
...kept on going up to Boston.
Probably at your grandma's house.

407
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,709
I'm gonna call her.

408
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,559
How come the lights are on here
and not at your place?

409
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,034
Because...

410
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,789
...nothing bad happened here. Okay?
So we're safe here. All right?

411
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,991
Okay, Rachel? This is your area.

412
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,272
- Okay, you are safe...
- Dad, that's not how it goes.

413
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,040
Okay. Well, are you hungry?
I'll get you some food.

414
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,152
I'm gonna feed you.
Get something to eat.

415
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,509
- What do we have?
- Busy signal.

416
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,075
- Ketchup? Mustard.
- You think all the circuits are down?

417
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,350
Tabasco, barbecue sauce.

418
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,120
This is really good, Robbie.
Vinaigrette. I said pack food.

419
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,073
- What the hell is this?
- That's all that was in your kitchen.

420
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,714
Okay. No, it's all right.

421
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,751
All right. Okay.

422
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,115
Food.

423
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,753
Bread.

424
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,634
Okay. We're gonna have...

425
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,352
Let's get some sandwiches.

426
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,479
Wanna see me deal?

427
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,838
Wanna see me deal? Here we go.

428
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,474
There's two for you.
There's two for Robbie.

429
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,671
There's two for me,
one for the house.

430
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,028
Okay.

431
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,913
Maybe after we eat something,
I'll go down and show you guys...

432
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,475
Teach you how to play some poker?
A little five-card stud?

433
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,114
- Maybe a little blackjack.
- I'm allergic to peanut butter.

434
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,595
Since when?

435
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,992
Birth.

436
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,519
Okay, well, here.

437
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,711
You can eat the bread. Okay?

438
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,273
I'm not hungry.

439
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,358
Okay, well,

440
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,676
Robbie and I are gonna be
eating peanut-butter sandwiches.

441
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,314
- Want jelly on this sandwich?
- I'm not hungry either.

442
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,476
You're not hungry either?

443
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,715
Okay.

444
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,559
Okay, that's fine.

445
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,079
Fine.

446
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,871
Everybody just relax, okay?

447
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,311
Because we're here now.
We're safe, and we're gonna stay.

448
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,511
In the morning, your mom and Tim
are gonna be here.

449
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,153
And everything's gonna be fine.

450
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,873
Okay?

451
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,912
Okay.

452
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,715
If everything's fine, why do we
have to sleep in the basement?

453
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,912
- We've got perfectly good beds.
- Hey, it's like a slumber party.

454
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,519
What are you afraid
is gonna happen?

455
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,039
Nice basement.

456
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,915
I wanna sleep in my bed.
Got back problems.

457
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,473
Okay. Well...

458
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,240
You know on the Weather Channel
when there's a tornado,

459
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,670
they tell you to go to the basement
for safety? It's like that.

460
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,711
- There's gonna be tornadoes?
- Okay, Rachel?

461
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,277
- Hey, no more talking, okay?
- Could you be a little nicer to me?

462
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,833
God.

463
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,315
- Wanna stay here?
- Yeah.

464
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,873
- Good.
- Good night. Love you.

465
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,718
Love you, Rach.

466
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,031
Is the lightning back?

467
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,396
No, this is something else.

468
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,754
- What's that sound?
- I've never heard that before!

469
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,279
Is it them? Is it them?

470
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,235
We gotta go.

471
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,112
Where do we go?!
Robbie, this is your house.

472
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,355
Where do we go?!

473
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,833
No, no, no, wait!

474
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,509
Are we still alive?

475
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,278
Down here.

476
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,231
Were you on this plane?

477
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,556
Are you...?
Are you a passenger?

478
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,993
How you doing?
Wanna help me open this?

479
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,112
Are you a passenger?

480
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,878
He's deaf.

481
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,550
The shell went off right beside him.
Camera on his shoulder saved his life.

482
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,034
You hear that, Max?

483
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,708
Your stupid camera
saved your stupid life.

484
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,278
Where were you?

485
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,631
Out there in the Pine Barrens.

486
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,237
We were attached to
a National Guard unit.

487
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,759
The 83rd Mechanized.

488
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,837
They moved on one of those things
around midnight.

489
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,759
They got some kind of shield
around them.

490
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,554
You can't see it, but everything we fire
at them detonates too early,

491
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,433
before we can get close enough
to cause any damage.

492
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,555
When they flash that thing,
everything lights up like Hiroshima.

493
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,310
There's more than one?

494
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,231
You gotta be kidding me, right?

495
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,391
We were feeding New York,
but New York went dark.

496
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,830
So we patched over to D.C.,
they went down.

497
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,634
L.A., Chicago, uplinked to London.

498
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,832
Even called the affiliates to try
to get them to catch the feed,

499
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,554
but nobody answers.
It's the same everywhere.

500
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,992
Once the Tripods start to move,
no more news comes out of that area.

501
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,838
My God.

502
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,671
You ain't seen nothing yet.

503
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,637
I saw that storm. I was right
in the middle of one of those.

504
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,239
Well, you didn't see it like this.

505
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,715
Those machines come up
from under the ground, right?

506
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,673
So that means they must've been
buried here a long time ago.

507
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,793
So who's driving the goddamn things?
Watch the lightning.

508
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,592
Watch it.

509
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,075
Watch the lightning.

510
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,350
Keep watching the lightning.

511
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,077
What is that?

512
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,239
That is them.
They come down in capsules,

513
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,238
riding the lightning into the ground,
into the machines, right?

514
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,917
You hear that?

515
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,395
We're getting the hell out of here.

516
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,358
Get in, get in, get in, get in.

517
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,832
Hey, were you on that plane?

518
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,711
That's too bad.
It would've been a really great story.

519
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,716
Look at me. Look at me.

520
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,956
You keep your eyes only on me,
understand?

521
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,991
- Okay.
- Don't look down. Don't look around.

522
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,553
I'm taking you to the car.
You're gonna wanna look around.

523
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,749
But you're not going to.

524
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,072
- Are you?
- No.

525
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,511
You're doing good. You're doing good.
Keep your eyes on me.

526
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,835
I'm going right to Boston.

527
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,110
- We're gonna see your mom.
- I'm not gonna look, Dad.

528
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,231
That's a girl. That's my girl.
Now listen.

529
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,078
- I want you to close your eyes, okay?
- Okay.

530
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,510
Got them closed? There you go.

531
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,915
- Keep them closed for me.
- Okay.

532
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,075
Robbie, get in.

533
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,798
- Robbie, get in!
- Why are you yelling?

534
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,513
It's okay.

535
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,193
Get in.

536
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,196
- Why aren't we on the turnpike?
- I don't want everybody

537
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,755
to see that we've got a working car.
We'll stay along the Hudson

538
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,111
till we find an open bridge or ferry,
then we're gonna cross the Hudson.

539
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:56,108
We'll take the back roads across
Connecticut, all the way to Boston.

540
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,198
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know, running, hiding.

541
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,356
- In their basements.
- If we had balls, we'd go back

542
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,870
- and find one of those things and kill it.
- Right. Yeah, good.

543
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,957
Why don't you just let me
make the big decisions.

544
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,559
Which would be when? Never, Ray?

545
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,034
- Never's about your speed.
- Stop it.

546
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,071
Enough of the "Ray" shit. All right?

547
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,508
- It's "Dad," "sir,"
- Don't fight.

548
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,631
Or if you want, "Mr. Ferrier."

549
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,957
That sounds a little weird to me,
but you decide.

550
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,318
- Dad?
- Yes, Rachel.

551
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,590
I've gotta go to the bathroom.

552
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,078
Really?

553
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,314
- I gotta go.
- Not so fast, not so fast, all right?

554
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,272
There's two things
we gotta watch out for.

555
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,789
And the second is people
who might want our car.

556
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,594
- There's nobody around.
- Yeah. I gotta go.

557
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:52,989
All right, Rachel?

558
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,599
Rachel, it's good right there.

559
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,870
I'm not going in front of you guys.

560
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,834
- Just go where I can see you.
- Are you crazy?

561
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,792
- Don't look!
- I'm not gonna look.

562
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,719
- Just stay in sight!
- That's looking!

563
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,753
Okay, well, listen, every time
you guys don't listen to me,

564
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,475
I'm telling your mother, okay?
I'm making a list.

565
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,278
Making a list.

566
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,320
- I told you to stay where I could see you.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

567
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,468
Stop! Stop!

568
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,398
Wait! Stop! Let me on!

569
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,116
Let me on! Give me a hand!

570
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,833
Wait! Stop!

571
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,713
- Stop! Give me a hand!
- Kid, you're gonna get run over!

572
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,639
- Give me a hand! You have room!
- Robbie!

573
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,593
- You wanna go in that direction?
- Stop! Stop!

574
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,712
There's nothing living
in that direction, Robbie.

575
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,717
What do you care?
You never gave a shit before.

576
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,876
- You never gave a shit!
- Okay, hard-ass,

577
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,230
what's your plan, huh?
You're in charge now!

578
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,556
- Tell me what we're doing.
- Catch up with these soldiers!

579
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,593
Hook up with whoever else isn't dead,
and we get back at them.

580
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,997
We get back at them.
That's what we do.

581
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,193
Let's try one that doesn't involve your
10-year-old sister joining the Army.

582
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,789
- You have anything like that?
- Just tell us the truth.

583
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,036
- Wanna try that?
- You have no idea which way to go.

584
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,151
You wanna come off all wise and shit!

585
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,828
You only chose Boston
because you hope Mom is there.

586
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,190
And if she's there,
you can dump us on her.

587
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,710
You can dump us on her, then you'll
only have to care about yourself,

588
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:12,435
which is exactly the way you like it.

589
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,674
Robbie!

590
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,916
Where are you trying to go?

591
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,634
What are you trying to do?

592
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,278
Who's gonna take care of me
if you go?

593
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,108
This is a test of
the Emergency Alert System.

594
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,354
If this had been an actual emergency,
official messages

595
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:50,235
from federal, state or local authorities
would've followed the alert tone.

596
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,034
This concludes the test
of the Emergency Alert...

597
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,434
I'll close my eyes.
Why don't you drive for a bit.

598
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,436
I don't have a license.

599
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,750
Since when has that stopped you?

600
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,798
Ray.

601
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,360
Ray! Dad!

602
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,237
Ray! Dad!

603
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,754
You think you could...?

604
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,520
You think you could...?
Do you think you could...?

605
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,679
Don't stop.

606
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,836
Don't take your foot off. Okay?

607
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,474
I got it, but keep your foot on.
Okay, I got it. I got it.

608
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,717
- Where is everybody going?
- I don't know, Rach.

609
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,797
But we do, right?

610
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,797
Yeah, we do.

611
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,718
Why did he do that?

612
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,717
- Why is he doing that?
- He wants a ride, Rach.

613
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,832
- Everybody just wants a ride.
- Can we give him one?

614
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,476
Sit back and put on your seat belt.
Robbie, put on your seat belt.

615
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,511
Put on your seat belt, Rachel.

616
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,397
- Be careful.
- How'd you fix this?

617
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,956
- How'd you fix the car?
- Please! Why won't you help us?

618
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,518
I'm sorry, I can't. I can't.

619
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,119
Please, get away from the car.

620
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,276
Hey! Stop the car.

621
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,074
- Stop the car!
- Get off the car!

622
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,951
You could carry 20 people in there!

623
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,116
- Stop the car!
- Get off the car!

624
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,878
Stop the car!

625
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,678
Hold on.

626
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:58,835
Look out!

627
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,519
Watch out! Hold on!

628
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,275
Are you okay?

629
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,038
No, wait! Wait!

630
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,629
No! Just wait! Okay! Wait! Stop!

631
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,637
- Just stop!
- Daddy!

632
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,273
Rachel!

633
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,558
Get out of there!

634
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,598
Robbie!

635
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,432
Robbie!

636
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,949
- Ray!
- Get in the car!

637
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,360
- Help!
- Rachel! Get out of the car!

638
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,471
Rachel, get...
Get out of the car.

639
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,955
- Get out!
- Daddy!

640
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,071
- Take it easy!
- Get off the car!

641
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,599
Get off!

642
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,199
Get off the car! Move!

643
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,038
Move!

644
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,958
- Where's my son?
- You don't need that, man.

645
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,549
- Where's my son? Robbie!
- Cool down, man.

646
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,557
- Put the gun down, man.
- Robbie!

647
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,953
Dad!

648
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,312
Okay, now, listen.

649
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,353
- Put down the gun. I'm taking the car.
- My daughter's in the car.

650
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,437
- I'm taking the car, man.
- Please. All I want...

651
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,154
- Put down the goddamn gun!
- All I want is my daughter.

652
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,590
- I'm taking the car, man.
- Please, I just want my daughter.

653
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,677
Let me just take my daughter.
Can l...?

654
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,838
- All I want is my daughter.
- Yeah. Okay, go ahead, man.

655
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,959
Robbie.
