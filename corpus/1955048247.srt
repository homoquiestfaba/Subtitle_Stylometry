1
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:57,756
All I see are bedrooms
and nurses stations here.

2
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:02,094
Yeah, well, it's a hospital.

3
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:04,596
It's a children's hospital!
It needs color.

4
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:05,664
Come on.

5
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,833
Are we partners?

6
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,689
Yeah.
- Are we par... We are partners.

7
00:01:10,724 --> 00:01:13,285
And I get the whole thing.
Your job is to cure these kids,

8
00:01:13,604 --> 00:01:14,692
my job's to
make them feel better.

9
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:17,509
We need animal stickers
on the windows.

10
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:19,676
We need sailboats
hanging from the ceiling.

11
00:01:20,022 --> 00:01:21,068
We need fun things...
- He's right.

12
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:22,247
For once.

13
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,382
Don't encourage him.

14
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,085
Thank you. Thank you.

15
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:28,520
I'm gonna make you
my first board member.

16
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,155
No thank you.

17
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:31,690
I don't wanna
sit on a board.

18
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,725
But thank you.
- Fine.

19
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:35,182
Coward.

20
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:36,716
Boby!
- Mmm?

21
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:39,037
You are the newest member
of the hospital board.

22
00:01:39,413 --> 00:01:41,050
Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

23
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,519
Congratulations.
- Mmm-hmm.

24
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:56,281
You know, you're starting
a new life.

25
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,284
You don't wanna take
too much from the old one.

26
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,860
Says the guy
with no baggage whatsoever.

27
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:06,225
Yeah, I guess I've kept it
pretty streamlined. Haven't I?

28
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,849
I'm gonna miss you, kid.

29
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,207
You need me,
you call me, okay?

30
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,509
Okay.
You got it.

31
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,717
Hey, get your
own daughter.

32
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,453
I don't need a daughter.
I have a poodle.

33
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:40,659
Well...
- Hey, hey, hey.

34
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,561
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

35
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,231
I'm starving.

36
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:31,243
Hey, hey,
not in the car.

37
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:32,377
I'm serious.

38
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,578
Maybe I should just
move in.

39
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:45,691
You are not moving in.
Best years of our lives, right...

40
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:47,826
It's like... it's like
college all over again.

41
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:51,932
But no poodles,
no responsibility...

42
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,074
Since when was she
your responsibility?

43
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,935
You guys would be lost
without me. You know it.

44
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,238
Oh, really? I don't know.
Yes, let's be honest.

45
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,572
Maybe not.

46
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:04,368
I'm just happy. I'm just happy
i got my friends back.

47
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,215
Full time, Bobby.

48
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,012
Hey... hey.

49
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:08,847
Whoa!

50
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,651
Yes.
<i>- Hi, franny?</i>

51
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,620
<i>Is that you?
Is this franny?</i>

52
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,455
I'm sorry, who...
Who is this?

53
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,891
<i>It's me, Olivia.</i>

54
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,760
<i>Hello?</i>
Uh...

55
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,195
What's this about?

56
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,697
<i>It's poodles.</i>
Is it...

57
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,466
<i>Poodles, come on.</i>

58
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:17,836
<i>- Franny...
-</i> No, I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.

59
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:20,539
No, I don't know anything about...
<i>Will you stop.</i>

60
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,974
You fall for that every time.
Don't you?

61
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,576
Poodles!

62
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:27,846
Poo... I can't believe this.
It's really you. <i>Yes.</i>

63
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,481
Holy shit!
<i>Did I wake you?</i>

64
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:30,682
No, wake me?
No, of course not.

65
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,484
I'm awake.
I was doing some work.

66
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:33,952
Yeah... so...
<i>So...</i>

67
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,855
So, what's going on?

68
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,457
<i>I just got married.</i>

69
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,693
You what?
<i>And I want to move back to Philly.</i>

70
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,028
You wanna come home.

71
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,852
I know, exactly.

72
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,121
No, he didn't...
He didn't want me to ask you.

73
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,992
He's... he's really sweet,
you're gonna love him.

74
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:18,997
It was just a stupid argument
with this department chair.

75
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,602
Wow, franny, that's...
That's amazing.

76
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,005
Okay.

77
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:31,009
You didn't have to tell him all that,
did you?

78
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,546
Wait,
when was the last time you even saw this guy?

79
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,047
This guy?

80
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:38,250
Well, I haven't even met him,
have I?

81
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,119
So, what did he say?

82
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,288
Um...

83
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,757
Well, he said, "yeah."

84
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:48,660
He said, "yeah"?
What does that mean?

85
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,129
He said, "yes,
it shouldn't be a problem."

86
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,565
What, for a job
or an interview?

87
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,634
I think he just
got you a job.

88
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:01,206
Holy shit, can he...
Can he even do that?

89
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,542
There's very little
that man can't do.

90
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:04,743
Really?

91
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:06,978
Franny?

92
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,557
Morning, Fran.

93
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,191
Hey.

94
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:23,929
You know, I'm getting really tired
of these northern exposures, Jesse.

95
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,998
Oh, do you want me to move you
to a suite on the other side?

96
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,266
It's not a problem.
No, no, no, no.

97
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:31,336
Why don't we just...
We'll put it back the way it was before.

98
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:32,871
I'm expecting guests.

99
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:34,940
Guests?

100
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,928
She's coming. Poodles is coming.
Yeah, it's good.

101
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,044
Whoa!

102
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:19,851
So, does this mean...
Does this mean we're moving to Philly?

103
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,620
Yeah, I guess so.

104
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,188
And you're sure
you wanna do that?

105
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,624
It was my idea,
wasn't it?

106
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,058
I like this one.
I like the red one.

107
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,727
I'm going with the red.

108
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,733
I'm feeling younger.

109
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:39,104
I'm feeling so young
and fresh.

110
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:43,008
I'm feeling delightful.

111
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,709
Delightful.

112
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,945
Delightful.

113
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:50,148
Full of delight.

114
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,223
Hey, how are
you doin'?

115
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,831
Hey, hey!

116
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,168
Susan, nice to see
you again. Looking good.

117
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,239
Hey, darling.
You're new here, aren't you?

118
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,041
Hey.

119
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,046
Hey, bud.

120
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,114
Oh, am I interrupting?

121
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,717
Hey, champ,
what's the matter?

122
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,285
I hate it here.

123
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,421
Oh. Hmm.

124
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,223
What can I do?

125
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,092
Get me out of here.

126
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,127
Well...

127
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,963
If that's what you want.

128
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,299
All righty!

129
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:46,471
Yep. We're gonna get you out of here,
partner.

130
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:47,872
What are you doing?

131
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,374
Making an escape.

132
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,711
All righty.

133
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:01,986
What are we doing?

134
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:03,955
We are hiding.

135
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,060
Sometimes when I'm feeling really sad,
i just go and hide somewhere.

136
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,363
You do? Yeah, yeah, sure.
All the time.

137
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:13,965
Everybody does.

138
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,234
Do you ever
get found?

139
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,272
Only when there's
someone looking.

140
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,375
Yeah.

141
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,244
But you know what?

142
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:30,348
It's a lot better when you
have someone to hide with.

143
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,317
You know that.

144
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,185
You're with me.
Got it?

145
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,123
Can I ask you
something really serious?

146
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,126
I got an old friend coming home.
I'm throwing her a party.

147
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,228
You think
i should get a haircut?

148
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,430
Yeah, you look
like a wizard.

149
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:48,066
Yeah... seems
to be unanimous.

150
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:49,968
All right. Whatever.

151
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,449
I honestly cannot remember the
last time you looked this good.

152
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,218
You're just saying that. Aren't you.
You're just saying that.

153
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,353
No, no, no.

154
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,221
You look good, franny.

155
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,325
She'll tell you
the same.

156
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,363
This will be the first time
I've seen him in years.

157
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:20,932
Really? Is he not
usually at the hospital?

158
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,867
He stops in and sees the
kids every once in awhile.

159
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,335
Otherwise he's a ghost.

160
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,806
Still haven't
met the guy yet.

161
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:31,376
From what I understand,
you're franny's star recruit.

162
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:35,046
Hired on the spot.
I'm just happy to be here.

163
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:38,483
I guess it's safe to say that things
were expedited a bit more than usual

164
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,385
for this young man.

165
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:43,321
Now, we gotta find something for him to do.
Right?

166
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,256
Right.

167
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:29,467
I'm back.

168
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,636
I didn't die. You're right.
Hey, hey, hey.

169
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,638
Nice haircut.

170
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,874
Yeah, you need
the haircut.

171
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:38,076
Wait...

172
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41,913
A fresh face in a sea
of old farts.

173
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:45,650
You, you are Dr. Luke.

174
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:47,485
Yeah. Nice to meet
you, sir.

175
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,888
Welcome to
Philadelphia, really.

176
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:53,124
Jesus, you are
gorgeous. Wow.

177
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:54,459
Well, she did good.

178
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,996
Hey, are you
really a doctor

179
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:01,366
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding. Ah!

180
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:02,467
The young doctor.

181
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:03,935
Yeah, I got
something for you.

182
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,603
These are cuff links.
Come here.

183
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,539
Look...

184
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,075
You're gonna be a man.
Do this.

185
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,544
I bought these for
Olivia's dad.

186
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,179
It was many moons ago.

187
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:18,049
I think it's appropriate
that you have them.

188
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,253
You've got some very
big shoes to fill.

189
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,955
Thank you, but I...
You don't have to tell poodles about

190
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:26,357
No, of course not.
Keep it just between us.

191
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,692
No, of course.
Of course.

192
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,361
Who exactly is poodles?

193
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,464
That's her name.
You didn't know that?

194
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,567
Oh, Olivia, right.

195
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,269
No, sorry, I...

196
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,438
Now, where's poodles.
Poodles, right.

197
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,352
Why are you hiding?

198
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,189
I haven't seen any of
these people in years.

199
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,492
I don't feel like
being judged.

200
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:38,262
You want me to tell them to leave?
I will.

201
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:44,402
Look at you.

202
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:50,241
Last time i saw
something so perfect

203
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,511
you were in there.

204
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,516
I knew...

205
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,487
I knew you'd be
someone very special.

206
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,789
I'm never wrong.

207
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,059
<i>Poodles, we're here for you,
darling.</i>

208
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,460
<i>You'll never
know how happy</i>

209
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:14,132
<i>You spent your whole life making
me and everyone around you smile</i>

210
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,667
<i>and I'm just so happy
that you're back</i>

211
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,437
<i>and you're giving us even
more reasons to smile.</i>

212
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,542
<i>When Olivia's father and
mother got married...</i>

213
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,144
<i>Actually, right over here.</i>

214
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,812
<i>I sang a song</i>

215
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:31,416
<i>for my best friend
and his new bride.</i>

216
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,786
<i>And to keep that
tradition going</i>

217
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:36,821
<i>I'm just gonna go out
and do it again.</i>

218
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,356
<i>And no one
can stop me!</i>

219
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:45,596
<i>Hey, Luke.
Hey, Luke, man.</i>

220
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:49,233
<i>You think that's your girl?
No, man, that's my girl.</i>

221
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,243
Come on out here
and dance, you two.

222
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:12,623
<i>That's good, come on, now.</i>

223
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,962
I don't remember the last
time i was out here.

224
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,499
That's why you're sitting on your
butt and not helping me out.

225
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:02,767
I knew there was a reason.

226
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,772
I know you probably
won't remember this.

227
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:13,444
you used to think i was a fisherman
just because I had this boat.

228
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,646
I'm pretty sure you told
me you were a fisherman.

229
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,648
Yeah, well, probably.

230
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:20,585
But...

231
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,421
You know,
i had to be something.

232
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,459
I always liked being a fisherman,
that's for sure.

233
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,840
Franny, I want
to apologize.

234
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,942
What are you
talking about?

235
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,745
For leaving
when I did.

236
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,716
I should have been there
for your recovery.

237
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,820
Stop it, poodles.
No, I'm serious.

238
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,022
I just had to
get out of here.

239
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,957
But I'm sorry.

240
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,296
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

241
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,334
It's not like I went out of the
way to do anything, either.

242
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:11,469
So...

243
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:15,973
I dunno about you but...
can't do anything about it.

244
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:19,577
Here you are.
It's great. Look at you.

245
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,646
I know what
you're thinking.

246
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:28,552
I'm not too young to have
a family of my own again.

247
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,858
No. No, you're not.

248
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,395
Yo.

249
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:12,530
Hey.

250
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,532
This is a nice surprise.
Uh-huh.

251
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:18,569
Apparently,
franny has a wedding gift for us.

252
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,120
Keep your
eyes closed. Come on.

253
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,704
Why are we here?

254
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,942
You are not gonna have
a baby in north Philly.

255
00:22:57,944 --> 00:22:59,610
What are you talking about?
No, uh-uh.

256
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:01,879
Look. Look at this.
Look at this. Look at this.

257
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:06,083
grows up with everything
that poodles had.

258
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,953
Holy shit.
Is this your old house?

259
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:10,154
Not anymore,
it isn't.

260
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,923
Did you buy my house?

261
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:15,960
I bought it for
the three of you.

262
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,698
Jesus Christ, franny.
Can we just slow down for a second shh.

263
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,800
Wait, wait, wait,
wait wait.

264
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,437
How do you know
she even wants this?

265
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,939
Come on. Give it a minute.
Look around, man.

266
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,881
Still has magic,
doesn't it?

267
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,417
Yeah.

268
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,819
Yeah, don't you feel it.

269
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:45,790
Hey, enjoy it.

270
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,530
Franny...
This is beautiful.

271
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:54,031
It really is.
It's a beautiful house.

272
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,534
But um...
We can't just up and leave.

273
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:57,701
I signed a lease, so...

274
00:23:57,703 --> 00:24:03,574
I wanted to take a little weight off...
Why didn't you...

275
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:07,878
No, I just...
I'm just trying to help you out.

276
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,514
I know that you probably are
buried underneath loans

277
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:12,216
and crazy stuff...
You got student loans, right?

278
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:13,617
Yeah, sure...
How much?

279
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,085
How... how much?
How much?

280
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:16,654
I don't know.

281
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:18,923
A couple
hundred grand.

282
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,593
I'm kidding.
Relax, man.

283
00:24:22,595 --> 00:24:26,664
She's standing right there.
That's really fucked, lukie.

284
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,132
You are...

285
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:33,571
I love surprises.
- Look at her.

286
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:37,975
I don't wanna step on your toes, all right?
Believe me about that.

287
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,911
So, you know.
All I want is really what's best for you

288
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:42,947
and her and for your family.
I know.

289
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:45,516
You know,
it's okay, it's okay.

290
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:46,750
Look, you wanna
know the truth?

291
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:47,818
All you gotta do
is say no.

292
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,620
You say no
and that is it.

293
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:51,088
Because you're
the man, lukie.

294
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,958
Why do you have to make
everything so dramatic?

295
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,593
I'm dramatic?

296
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:57,194
You think
I'm dramatic?

297
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:58,996
I can't believe
you did this.

298
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:01,932
You know, I was the one
that found this house

299
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:03,534
when your mother
was pregnant with you.

300
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:04,935
No, you didn't.

301
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:06,871
I found the realtor,
all right?

302
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:13,611
Just, just stop.
Just me and livvy, yeah?

303
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:15,079
Oh, really?
Yeah.

304
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:17,147
Oh, yeah, sorry.
Didn't quite get that.

305
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:19,216
Yeah, that's fine. Sure.
I'll put the pens away.

306
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:21,051
No one has
to sign anything...

307
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,087
I'll tell you what.

308
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:26,657
You can go in.
Spend some time for yourself.

309
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:28,759
"P" for "poodles."

310
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,128
Enjoy.

311
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:34,698
Don't break anything.

312
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:49,079
Holy shit.

313
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:54,785
Is this guy for real?

314
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,188
You all right?

315
00:25:58,857 --> 00:25:59,924
Did you see him?

316
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,327
I don't think
we can say no.

317
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:40,864
So, why's he so rich?

318
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:42,967
Never asked.

319
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,702
You never asked?

320
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,737
I find that kind of
hard to believe.

321
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:48,238
No, I was just
a kid.

322
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,608
I didn't think about
those kinds of things.

323
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,311
Has he ever had a job?

324
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:55,846
Yeah.
Like what?

325
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:58,849
I don't know.
He's a philanthropist.

326
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:01,785
That's definitely
not a job.

327
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:05,356
<i>He's been through a lot.</i>

328
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,324
<i>So, he's 60.</i>

329
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:12,162
<i>Got no kids, no family,
and no job.</i>

330
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,300
<i>I don't know what the
fuck he does all day.</i>

331
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:21,405
<i>I guess I really
have no idea.</i>

332
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:23,641
<i>You told me
he was put together.</i>

333
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,944
<i>That dude is not
put together.</i>

334
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:28,946
<i>You're being
an asshole.</i>

335
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:33,017
<i>Come on.
I just wanna know what he wants from us.</i>

336
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:41,091
<i>I owe it to him.</i>

337
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,062
You owe it to him to
take a house from him?

338
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,102
I want our baby
to know my family.

339
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:57,074
That house is the closest
I can get to them.

340
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,447
Yeah, I know.

341
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,284
Come on, now.

342
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:12,956
Yeah. We'll put it in the
front and figure it out later.

343
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,325
Okay...

344
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:19,463
Come on, guys. Maybe... Big stuff. You want
me to hold this for you? I'll hold it.

345
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,199
Bring it in.
Bring that in.

346
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,368
Bring that in.

347
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:28,272
We're doing something very special here,
ladies and gentlemen.

348
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,408
We're turning
a house into a home.

349
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,178
You look good
carrying stuff, man.

350
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,313
You look really good
carrying.

351
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,250
Oh, look at her
over there.

352
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:43,287
Wish I was pregnant.
I could just sit there

353
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:45,022
and pull on a doobie.

354
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,090
Oh, no.

355
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:57,828
All right,
what did she do?

356
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,296
It's actually
perfect for you.

357
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:01,431
No!

358
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:04,535
Just like the good 'ol days...
Let us sleep!

359
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,905
Good ol' days.
Let us sleep.

360
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,248
And you, a doctor...
Shameful, shameful...

361
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,949
Jesus Christ, franny.
What are you doing here?

362
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:27,417
You know, this is moving day.
Where've ya been?

363
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:30,320
I've been at the job you got me, working.
Ah.

364
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,356
Come on, I need you to
help me out with something.

365
00:31:32,358 --> 00:31:34,391
No, no, no.
I need to go see livvy.

366
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,526
Poodles is sleeping.
Put that out...

367
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:37,928
Here.

368
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,529
No vices. Come on.

369
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,647
What am I doing here, franny?

370
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:02,653
Wait a minute, wait.
Stop, stop, stop...

371
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:06,023
A-ha!

372
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:10,160
I knew it! I knew it, damn!

373
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,030
What is it?

374
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,668
Oh, a-ha...

375
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,103
How are you, friend?
How've ya been?

376
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,371
You been good? Yeah...

377
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:24,441
I can't believe this.

378
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:27,044
Mia and I...

379
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:29,146
We brought this up here...

380
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,448
Right after they moved in.

381
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:34,117
Mia?
Yeah.

382
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,486
Like, Olivia's mom?
Yeah, yeah.

383
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:39,389
What were they like?
Olivia doesn't really...

384
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,693
Olivia doesn't really talk about them much.
We were...

385
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,995
We were partners in crime.

386
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:46,730
Bobby was my sidekick.

387
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,701
Mia...

388
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:58,208
She was something else,
she was...

389
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,544
She was the fun one.
Of the three of us,

390
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:02,646
that was her.
You know...

391
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:05,582
We brought the best bottle up
and we buried it here.

392
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:08,986
You know, I don't know exactly
what we were...

393
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:12,222
Thinking. I guess the idea was
when we were old and thirsty,

394
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:14,257
we'd come up and get it.

395
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:18,462
Now it's just you and me,
partner.

396
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,764
Bottom's up!

397
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,166
Yeah.

398
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,108
Hey, franny, I need
to ask you something.

399
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:35,278
Ah... trying to have a moment
here, kid. Don't fuck it up.

400
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,251
Did you pay my loan?

401
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,355
Listen, if you don't
know about it,

402
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,324
I don't know about it.

403
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,594
So, you did, you paid my loans?
I did.

404
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,129
You...

405
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:54,064
Jesus Christ, franny.

406
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,366
How?
How... lukie,

407
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:59,569
lukie, you work for me now.
I know your finances.

408
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:01,471
Consider this a signing bonus.

409
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:03,340
A signing bonus?
I'm not an athlete, franny.

410
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:05,742
No, you're a doctor. You actually
deserve a bonus. No, no, no, no...

411
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:08,211
This isn't okay, all right?
I'm not your fucking...

412
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,346
I'm not your fucking sidekick.

413
00:34:09,348 --> 00:34:10,814
Why are you being so
fucking selfish?

414
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,783
You think it's about you
and just you?

415
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:14,584
I did this for poodles, too.

416
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:16,620
Not just you, both of you.

417
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:18,555
Sit down! Please...

418
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,258
Sit down. Sit down right here.
Please, sit down.

419
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,629
You're a doctor,
you shouldn't have loans.

420
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:28,632
You should be saving people.
It's simple, all right?

421
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:31,435
You could fight this all you want.
It doesn't matter. It's gonna...

422
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,306
All right.
Pay me back in five years.

423
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:37,808
Pay you back?
Every penny.

424
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,643
Or you're in trouble, buddy.

425
00:34:39,645 --> 00:34:42,179
I mean that. Yeah, look...

426
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:44,514
Truth is, I'm probably getting
more out of this than you are.

427
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:46,383
I should be thanking you.
No, no... stop it.

428
00:34:46,385 --> 00:34:48,452
Thank you.
Don't... don't.

429
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,720
Thank you, kid.
Come on...

430
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,190
Thank you.

431
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:55,659
Take a sip of that.

432
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:57,727
Don't be rude. Sit down.

433
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:02,232
It's not bad.
What is it?

434
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:05,735
I don't even remember
what it was.

435
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:07,771
Don't waste it,
don't waste it.

436
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,573
Whoa...

437
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,742
Fuck me...
You're such a pussy.

438
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:35,232
Is there something i can bring you up?
No, no. I'm fine.

439
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,474
Is, uh... is Charlie here?

440
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,544
Charlie... Charlie's, uh...

441
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,880
Charlie's out back.

442
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:57,220
Uh-huh...

443
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:08,365
You sure I can't get you something...
Hey, lukie. Lukie...

444
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:09,766
Lukie, did I...

445
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:11,334
You know...

446
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,869
I don't know if i
told you about this.

447
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:15,472
There's a fundraiser
for the hospital.

448
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:17,574
I'm thinking maybe you should
come with me.

449
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:18,942
Um...

450
00:36:18,944 --> 00:36:22,779
Well, I mean, yeah... I'd be honored,
but I can't. I'm working tomorrow.

451
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:25,182
Yeah, I know.
I spoke to Romano. Yeah.

452
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:26,616
The board cleared it.
It's fine.

453
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:28,351
You went to the
board for this?

454
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:32,756
Well, yeah, I mean... I'm...
I kind of am the board.

455
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:36,293
Yeah.

456
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,462
I'm feeling like I wanna
show you off, man.

457
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:44,234
You know? You are the man. You're my man,
our man, everybody's man, man...

458
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:46,636
What is this over here?

459
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:49,339
Did you... I can't believe...
You're making the crib!

460
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:50,941
Sweet!

461
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:54,911
When are you finding the time to do this?
This is amazing.

462
00:36:54,913 --> 00:36:57,881
You know, I'm actually pretty good
with my hands. I'm a good woodworker.

463
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:59,683
Hey, I would like to help.

464
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:02,452
I would be proud! If I...
You know what, um...

465
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,621
I can do this.

466
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:07,757
Yeah, I think I'm gonna tackle this
one on my own. I think... but, uh...

467
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:10,627
Okay.
You know, if... you know,

468
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:13,697
if I mess up,
you'll be the first to call.

469
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:17,601
Okay.
Yeah, all right, well... Yeah.

470
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:19,236
Okay.
Okay.

471
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,504
All right, well, you just settle in now.
Okay.

472
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:23,240
The two of you.
Okay.

473
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:25,242
You two lovey lovebirds.

474
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:27,544
Okay, we'll see you
at the hospital tomorrow.

475
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:28,645
Bye.

476
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,514
Lukie, do you have a tux?

477
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:33,316
Uh... no. No, I don't.

478
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,652
You don't, okay. Well, don't worry about it.
I got you covered.

479
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:38,355
Okay, you sure?
You need anything?

480
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:41,558
Just give me a call, okay?
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

481
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:45,295
Tootles, poodles.

482
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,631
Bye.
Love you.

483
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,703
Bye, franny.

484
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:09,052
<i>I don't think you were
afraid of anything.</i>

485
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,522
I'm not. No.
Well, that's good, that's good...

486
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:15,392
'Cause, um...
Everything's gonna be fine.

487
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:17,927
Did I tell you that
i had surgery once?

488
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:20,030
You did?
Yeah, yeah. It's nothing.

489
00:38:20,032 --> 00:38:23,466
Nothing to be worried about.
Nothing. No, it was perfectly fine.

490
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,035
When I came out...

491
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,936
Bizarre.
But...

492
00:38:28,307 --> 00:38:30,373
I started farting
all the time!

493
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:33,076
I hope it doesn't
happen to you.

494
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:34,978
Besides,

495
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:37,914
I'll be here
the whole time.

496
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:41,618
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Would you like that?

497
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,886
Yeah.

498
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:49,025
<i>Paging Dr. Harris.
Mr. watts is at reception.</i>

499
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:51,895
Armando, no, no, no, don't.
You don't have to measure that.

500
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:54,564
The kid gets very
self-conscious about his dingy.

501
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:56,399
So, where was I?
Oh, the point was... yes.

502
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:59,402
We were towards the
end of our relationship.

503
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:00,937
We both knew
it was almost over...

504
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:04,040
Again, beautiful girl.
Like, it's... it's over.

505
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:08,345
is she gonna be showing the
snaggly tooth to somebody else.

506
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:10,847
She's gonna be doing
the snaggly, cuteness

507
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,482
all over the place.
Right.

508
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:14,718
And that's when
i realized that

509
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:17,987
I actually like being alone.

510
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:27,097
You know, not everyone can
have a poodles, my friend.

511
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:28,898
God bless. Yeah...

512
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,468
Amando, bring the black one.

513
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,436
Amando,
go get the tails for him.

514
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:34,838
That's good.

515
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:37,774
Oh, there we go.

516
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:39,743
Okay...
That's the deal.

517
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,879
A-ha, maestro.

518
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,582
Ooh, looking good.

519
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,684
Holy shit.

520
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:51,688
You, uh... you sure I'm not
gonna be over-dressed?

521
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,924
Are you kidding me?
You're going to look adorable.

522
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,695
Go, try it on. Armando,
give him the whole thing. Let him try it on.

523
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:01,030
You want me to do it now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

524
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:02,899
Give him the pants.

525
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,501
Oh, yeah!

526
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,677
Hey, lukie, I need you
to do me a favor.

527
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:23,420
Not that kind of favor,
you sick fuck. No.

528
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,822
I... I need you to
write me a prescription.

529
00:40:25,824 --> 00:40:28,625
I hate to go to the doctor's office.
Those smells make me gag.

530
00:40:28,627 --> 00:40:32,529
Will you do that for me?
Just for convenience sake. Please.

531
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:34,497
Er... well, it's not really
something I could do, franny.

532
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:37,066
I mean, I'm on a
pretty tight leash.

533
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:38,735
Ooh...

534
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,138
I'm kind of holding
that leash.

535
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,874
Aren't I? Yeah...

536
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:47,577
Yeah. Um...

537
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:51,147
Okay, what are you, uh...
What are you taking?

538
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:54,050
Well, I don't even know
what this shit is, really.

539
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:55,985
Here.

540
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:00,957
Accidentally spilled it, huh?

541
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:02,759
Morphine, franny?

542
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:03,860
So?

543
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:09,165
Franny,
i can't prescribe you this.

544
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:14,737
I can't. Are you really
in that much pain? I...

545
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:17,507
I don't think you need it.

546
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:21,878
I really don't think you should
be telling me what I need, lukie.

547
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,249
You know, it wasn't easy
getting you this job.

548
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:35,892
Franny, how long
have you been taking this?

549
00:41:35,894 --> 00:41:37,727
I'm kidding, I'm kidding,
I'm sorry.

550
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:40,663
No, I'm kidding.
This was all a joke, man.

551
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:42,866
It was a test.
Relax, relax.

552
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:45,235
You passed the test. You did good.
I'm proud of you.

553
00:41:45,237 --> 00:41:46,803
You did that?
No, no, no, this is good.

554
00:41:46,805 --> 00:41:51,174
Shit, man, you are exactly like this.
He wouldn't have done it either.

555
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:52,876
No, you don't roll over
for anybody.

556
00:41:52,878 --> 00:41:55,678
Not for me. Nobody.
The world needs more men like you.

557
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,547
Thank god I know you!

558
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,129
Hey, remember me?

559
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:47,897
Franny.

560
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:50,567
Your old friend, franny.
Franny watts.

561
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:52,669
How ya been?

562
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:57,140
Francis. Yeah, franny, Francis, whatever.
Francis watts.

563
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:01,945
Here you go. Could you fill that up for me,
please? Thanks.

564
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,248
You don't have
any more refills, sir.

565
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:09,719
That can't be right.

566
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:15,124
Do you have a new
prescription, sir?

567
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:17,994
No, I don't have a new prescription...
I never had any prescription.

568
00:43:17,996 --> 00:43:20,663
Dr. Gibbs calls these in
for me. That's how we do it.

569
00:43:20,665 --> 00:43:22,632
Then you should
call Dr. Gibbs.

570
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:26,035
Look, man, it's
after midnight.

571
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:28,271
I can't call him now.
Could you...

572
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:29,639
Hey.

573
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:34,344
Are you looking for the right name in here?
Sir. Sir, yes!

574
00:43:34,346 --> 00:43:36,679
Sir, please, do not touch the computer.
Well, look under Gibbs...

575
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:38,848
If it's urgent you should
go to the hospital.

576
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:40,283
I have a hospital, all right?

577
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:42,051
I own a hospital.

578
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:45,054
Then you should
go there, sir.

579
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:47,624
Okay, okay, okay, I'm good...

580
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,130
Look... I'm sorry.

581
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:57,667
Look at this. Look what I got.
Look what I got.

582
00:43:57,669 --> 00:44:00,069
I'm just gonna put it here.
That's...

583
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:07,810
Just get out of here. Okay?
I can't help you, sir. Does it help?

584
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,880
Help me. Could you help me?
Help me.

585
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:14,817
There's nothing I can do to help you, sir.
Could you help me out?

586
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,019
I'm not feeling good...

587
00:44:16,021 --> 00:44:18,087
You should call your doctor.

588
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:19,956
He can get you
a new prescription.

589
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:24,360
There's nothing else
i can do for you, sir.

590
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:29,932
Yeah, I... whoa.

591
00:44:31,036 --> 00:44:36,272
Hey, man, I'm sorry.
I'm a little embarrassed. I didn't, uh...

592
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:40,076
Sorry, I'm really embarrassed. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be yelling at you...

593
00:44:40,078 --> 00:44:42,912
Sir, your watch.
Keep the watch. Keep it.

594
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:45,448
I want you to have it.

595
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,819
Damn it!

596
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:26,856
<i>He's a good guy.</i>

597
00:45:26,858 --> 00:45:27,957
<i>Huh?</i>

598
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:32,762
And I was just thinking...
And...

599
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:35,732
Why do I just wanna strangle him?
What?

600
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:39,068
Don't get me wrong,
i like him. I do, but...

601
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:43,239
I mean, how'd your dad
deal with it?

602
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:47,910
My parents were
just friends with him.

603
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:51,914
They didn't need
anything from him.

604
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,318
I don't need anything
from him.

605
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:15,404
Except, maybe some furniture.

606
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:24,447
God!

607
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,899
Are you okay? I'm sorry!

608
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,447
Help!

609
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:33,082
Help!

610
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,027
Bobby! I'm coming.

611
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,509
You're okay.
You'll be okay.

612
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:03,312
Bobby? Bobby!

613
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:06,249
Stay with me, stay with me!

614
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:12,154
Help!

615
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:17,360
Mia... hey! Help!

616
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:19,662
Help!

617
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:22,999
Stay with me! Stay with me,
don't leave...

618
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:25,134
Stay with me, stay with me...

619
00:48:25,136 --> 00:48:27,069
Bobby! Stay with me!

620
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,272
<i>Help!</i>

621
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,275
<i>Help!</i>

622
00:48:34,279 --> 00:48:38,414
<i>I'm not gonna shut up yet 'cause there's
one more thing I would like to do.</i>

623
00:48:38,616 --> 00:48:44,020
<i>to the newest member of our board
of directors of the foundation,</i>

624
00:48:44,022 --> 00:48:45,221
<i>Dr. Luke Harris.</i>

625
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:49,458
<i>Luke, stand up.
Stand up, come on.</i>

626
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,593
<i>Uh...</i>

627
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:54,563
<i>Dr. Luke Harris, everybody!</i>

628
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:57,233
<i>Uh...</i>

629
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,239
<i>You know,
when I look at this young man,</i>

630
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:05,107
<i>I can't help but see...</i>

631
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:09,111
<i>See my best friend,</i>

632
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:12,048
<i>Dr. Bobby mcclellan. He, um...</i>

633
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:16,252
<i>He's the physician who inspired
this whole enterprise. He, um...</i>

634
00:49:16,254 --> 00:49:18,387
<i>He was an honorable man.</i>

635
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:23,426
<i>Unlike me, he didn't come up here and
do a song and dance and ask for money.</i>

636
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:24,493
<i>He, um...</i>

637
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:35,705
<i>Sorry.</i>

638
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,107
<i>My, uh...</i>

639
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:43,679
<i>My dear friend Bobby.
The best gift he ever gave me</i>

640
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:46,315
<i>was his friendship.</i>

641
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:51,287
<i>And now he's giving his
legacy to me</i>

642
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:54,357
<i>to share with this young man.</i>

643
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,027
<i>You're not going to
let us down, are you?</i>

644
00:49:58,029 --> 00:49:59,628
<i>Are you?</i>

645
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:02,198
<i>No, you won't.
You won't do that.</i>

646
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:07,536
<i>Thank you... uh, go on.</i>

647
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:51,113
I bet you've seen worse, huh?

648
00:50:51,115 --> 00:50:52,515
Thank you.

649
00:50:52,517 --> 00:50:54,216
Thank you, thank you.

650
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,362
Hey,
it's the king of Philadelphia.

651
00:51:06,364 --> 00:51:09,231
Hey. Mind if I steal away
the prince for a moment?

652
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:11,300
No, we can spare him...
Just for a moment, thank you very much.

653
00:51:11,302 --> 00:51:13,235
Let's get out of here.
You don't know who that was?

654
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:14,837
He's a dickhead.

655
00:51:14,839 --> 00:51:17,106
If I would have ran,
he would not be mayor.

656
00:51:17,108 --> 00:51:19,775
He's not mayor. Listen,
i need to get back to Olivia right away.

657
00:51:19,777 --> 00:51:23,412
We're only 20 minutes away,
if she goes into labor, she'll call you.

658
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:28,184
Do you hear what I was saying up there?
You're the new board member.

659
00:51:28,186 --> 00:51:30,553
Yeah. Why am I the
new board member?

660
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:31,654
'Cause that's what I want.

661
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:32,755
Yeah, but it doesn't
make any sense.

662
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:34,090
I haven't proven myself
to anyone.

663
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:35,391
You've proven yourself to me.

664
00:51:35,393 --> 00:51:36,725
You don't have to prove
yourself to anyone else.

665
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:38,394
You've proven yourself to
people your entire life.

666
00:51:38,396 --> 00:51:41,230
You've earned everything you've got.
Now just say thank you,

667
00:51:41,232 --> 00:51:42,498
and get drunk with me.

668
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,302
I need this, actually.
I really need this.

669
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:09,158
Hey! Yo!

670
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:11,260
Lukie!

671
00:52:11,262 --> 00:52:12,695
This used to be
a cigar lounge.

672
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:14,663
Bobby brought me here
on my 27th birthday.

673
00:52:14,665 --> 00:52:16,165
It used to be class.

674
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:17,666
What are we doing here?

675
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:19,201
It's my birthday.
Your birthday?

676
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:22,404
Yes. Luke, Molly,
Molly, Luke.

677
00:52:22,406 --> 00:52:23,906
Hey, what's up?

678
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:27,143
Ya want one?
I just bought 'em from Molly.

679
00:52:27,145 --> 00:52:29,745
I don't think her name's
Molly. That's Molly.

680
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:32,481
Hey, I'm Luke, nice to...
Molly.

681
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:36,185
Okay. Molly gave you
ecstasy, great.

682
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,855
Whoa, whoa, whoa, franny... Franny, come on.
Jesus Christ, man.

683
00:52:39,857 --> 00:52:42,324
It's my birthday, too.

684
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:45,327
Yeah, hi there.
Go ahead, take it.

685
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:46,462
No.
Come on, take it.

686
00:52:46,464 --> 00:52:47,630
Cost me 40 bucks
to buy this.

687
00:52:47,632 --> 00:52:49,798
I don't care.
I'm not taking ecstasy.

688
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,268
So fucking stiff! I can't believe this.
What? I'm not stiff...

689
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:55,571
and I'm telling you to take it.
You're telling me to take it.

690
00:52:55,573 --> 00:52:57,773
Stop it, all right.
All right, you earned this.

691
00:52:57,775 --> 00:52:59,341
This is for you.
Stop it.

692
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:00,943
Stop it. Come off it.
Don't do that.

693
00:53:00,945 --> 00:53:03,412
No, I'm not taking ecstasy.
No.

694
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:04,914
Whoo!

695
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:08,584
Get back in there,
you hound dog.

696
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:11,554
Whoo!
Ooh! How you doing?

697
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,869
<i>Hey, this is Luke.
Leave a message, thanks.</i>

698
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:28,904
<i>Hi, it's me, um...</i>

699
00:53:28,906 --> 00:53:31,740
I'm not trying to
ruin your night,

700
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:34,577
but I just don't know if
you're coming home.

701
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:37,246
I just really don't want
to be here alone.

702
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:40,449
<i>I really don't
want to be here.</i>

703
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:41,717
<i>So call me if
you're coming home.</i>

704
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,368
I gotta be honest, man.

705
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:02,404
Olivia fucking loves you, man.

706
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:06,475
She does.

707
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:10,412
You know,
i didn't really get it at first.

708
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:12,915
'Cause, you know,
you're kind of annoying,

709
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:15,584
just to be honest. You see,
you have this, like,

710
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:19,388
crazy uncle thing where you're
kind of cool and, like...

711
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:22,891
You've got all this money and you
can just breeze in and breeze out,

712
00:54:22,893 --> 00:54:24,727
and you don't have to deal
with any of the problems.

713
00:54:24,729 --> 00:54:27,429
You know, I could see that
that's the good way to go.

714
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:28,497
That's cool...

715
00:54:28,499 --> 00:54:29,565
You know, I'm gonna be a...

716
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,367
I'm gonna be a dad, man.

717
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:32,935
I know,
you're gonna be a dad.

718
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,971
I'm gonna be a dad!
You're gonna be a dad!

719
00:54:35,973 --> 00:54:38,307
You are gonna be a dad.

720
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:40,009
I'm gonna be a dad...

721
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:44,313
That's crazy. No, you're gonna be...
You'd be such a good dad.

722
00:54:44,315 --> 00:54:46,849
You would.
You'd be such a good dad.

723
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:49,652
And it's like...

724
00:54:49,654 --> 00:54:51,820
We didn't plan it,
it just happened. And we're...

725
00:54:51,822 --> 00:54:54,490
What was I supposed to do? I mean,
I just have to deal with it, you know?

726
00:54:54,492 --> 00:54:56,458
I didn't wanna lose her.

727
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,294
'Cause I love her.

728
00:54:58,296 --> 00:55:00,929
I didn't want to lose her,
but I just...

729
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:07,903
I didn't think I'd be
doing it now, you know?

730
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:12,441
I like this scarf.

731
00:55:12,443 --> 00:55:14,009
Don't be nervous.

732
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:16,612
You're gonna do good.

733
00:55:16,614 --> 00:55:18,080
I am nervous.

734
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:19,815
You're gonna be good.

735
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:21,417
Good dad.

736
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:23,752
Good husband.

737
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:26,322
'Cause you're good.

738
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:30,959
Whoo!

739
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:54,383
Come on. Come on, get up here.
All right.

740
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:02,758
Feels good, right?

741
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:13,402
Feels good!

742
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:14,803
Feel good!

743
00:56:14,805 --> 00:56:17,573
Ah!
Whoo!

744
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:27,015
Where ya been, man?

745
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:31,754
Where ya been?

746
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,164
One more stop. This is
the best of everything.

747
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,480
Whoa!

748
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:39,087
How many of us are there here?

749
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:42,624
I wasn't expecting any guests.
You want a nightcap or something?

750
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:46,562
No, I'm good, I'm good.
I think I just need to sleep. Whoa...

751
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:48,464
Fair enough.

752
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,468
You still live here, man?

753
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:53,836
Yeah, used to...

754
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:55,838
Long time ago.

755
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:01,710
The bedrooms are upstairs.

756
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:04,713
You, uh,
make yourself at home.

757
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:09,618
Okay.

758
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:04,706
Squeeze a cheek, mister.
Come on.

759
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,275
Oh...

760
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:09,244
Oh, god...

761
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:31,733
I gotta ask you something.

762
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:33,602
Franny...

763
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:37,639
I'm exhausted, man. I just...
I can't, I can't...

764
00:59:37,641 --> 00:59:39,908
Go to sleep.
No one's bombin' ya.

765
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,344
Go to sleep.

766
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,683
You know...

767
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,820
I have a...

768
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:56,992
I never wanted to be
close to anyone.

769
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:02,998
I've always wanted people
to love me.

770
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:05,734
Everyone.

771
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:15,143
It's not a coincidence, is it?
That you're here.

772
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:17,346
We're together again.

773
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:20,749
It isn't...

774
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:28,991
Bobby, you and Mia were the
only ones I ever got close to.

775
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:34,363
I never wanted to get close
to anyone. You know that.

776
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:41,870
I didn't tell.

777
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,975
I didn't tell anybody.
I didn't tell anybody what happened.

778
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:48,744
I didn't tell anybody.

779
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:53,015
I didn't tell anyone
it was my fault.

780
01:00:57,854 --> 01:01:01,223
Do you remember?
Do you remember what happened, Bobby?

781
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:12,768
It should've been me, Bobby,
not you. You had everything.

782
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:15,370
It was...
It should've been me.

783
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:24,072
Franny?

784
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:26,908
Franny?

785
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:43,492
Hey, franny.
Sam. Been a while.

786
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,060
It sure has.

787
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:46,995
You're looking pretty good.

788
01:02:46,997 --> 01:02:48,130
Cut the shit.

789
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:54,402
You know, I got embarrassed
at the pharmacy the other day.

790
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:57,205
Yeah, I know. I know.
I'm really sorry about that.

791
01:02:57,207 --> 01:03:00,008
Well? Well,
I've been trying to reach you for months.

792
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:01,877
And you're impossible to get
hold of, franny.

793
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:04,846
Since when
do we need to talk?

794
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:09,551
Okay, going forward, I...

795
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:13,288
I can't sign off
on any more refills.

796
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:16,291
Your recovery period has been
drawn out too long already.

797
01:03:21,231 --> 01:03:25,267
I left messages.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

798
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:32,240
I've been pretty good
to you, haven't I, Sam?

799
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:35,277
I'm pretty good. To you.

800
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:37,546
Regulations have changed.

801
01:03:37,548 --> 01:03:43,451
You have to understand that.
You got me on this. You kept it going.

802
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:47,889
And now you're pulling the plug to save
your ass? We both have a part in this.

803
01:03:47,891 --> 01:03:51,293
That is not what is happening here.
We both... you are my doctor!

804
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:53,361
And that's exactly
what's happening!

805
01:03:53,363 --> 01:03:55,297
It's exactly what
has happened!

806
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:57,065
Sam.

807
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:01,036
Sam.

808
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:05,607
I don't feel well.

809
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:08,944
I don't feel well at all.

810
01:04:08,946 --> 01:04:11,413
I know. Okay, okay, listen.
Listen, I understand.

811
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:14,549
I understand, okay.
This is what I'm gonna do.

812
01:04:14,551 --> 01:04:16,284
I'm gonna do something. Okay.
Okay.

813
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:18,587
I'm gonna write you
a prescription

814
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:23,124
for something called tramadol and it's
gonna help wean you off hydromorphone.

815
01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:26,595
I'm also gonna let you
take home some klonopin.

816
01:04:26,597 --> 01:04:31,399
Are you fucking joking? What is this?
What... What are you talking about?

817
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:33,368
What are you
fucking doing to me?

818
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:36,104
Sam, what is it?

819
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:39,174
You need more money?
I don't pay you enough?

820
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:42,277
Is that it? I can...
Listen.

821
01:04:42,279 --> 01:04:43,979
I can give you whatever you want.
Doesn't matter to me.

822
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:48,049
I think the best option
for you right now is rehab.

823
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:52,153
It is very discreet,
and they're gonna take very good care of you.

824
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:56,424
I'm 60 years old.

825
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:59,961
I'm 60 years old.
I'm in a lot of pain.

826
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:03,431
I'm not a drug addict.

827
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:08,136
I'm not a drug addict.

828
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:11,673
Help me.

829
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:16,411
Please.

830
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:13,395
<i>It's franny, yeah.
Listen, I'm really sorry about...</i>

831
01:07:13,397 --> 01:07:17,098
Yeah, I didn't wanna call you
at home I just... yeah.

832
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:20,301
Yeah, no. It's my leg, my leg.
No, just my leg.

833
01:07:20,303 --> 01:07:21,403
Yeah.

834
01:07:21,405 --> 01:07:26,074
No, no. I said I'm not going to rehab.
No, I'm not gonna do that.

835
01:07:26,076 --> 01:07:27,809
Sam, come on.
Be reasonable, Sam.

836
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:32,280
It's five years. I...
I know what the fuck I need. I know that!

837
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:35,683
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Wait, wait, wait... No, I can't.

838
01:07:35,685 --> 01:07:37,152
I can't come in tomorrow.
No.

839
01:07:37,154 --> 01:07:39,354
Now! Let's do it now.
Just call it in.

840
01:07:39,356 --> 01:07:41,423
<i>Just call it in.
Just call it in, please, just...</i>

841
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:51,366
<i>Call it in. Call it in! Call it in!
Just call it in! Call it.</i>

842
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:19,854
Stupid, stupid.
Careless.

843
01:09:23,727 --> 01:09:26,261
I'm gonna need something
heavy duty for this, doc.

844
01:09:26,762 --> 01:09:28,663
I'll send you home with
some ibuprofen.

845
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:31,432
Ibuprofen?
Mmm-hmm.

846
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:35,370
What, you kidding me?
Come on, are you kidding?

847
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:39,440
No. No, no. I'm...
I'm in a lot of pain here.

848
01:09:39,442 --> 01:09:41,409
You don't understand.
This... this is serious.

849
01:09:41,411 --> 01:09:42,710
Sir, I need you to sit back.

850
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:48,316
What about hydromorphone?

851
01:09:48,318 --> 01:09:52,220
I mean, look at this wound.
That's probably a better idea, isn't it?

852
01:09:52,222 --> 01:09:56,257
I'm in a lot of pain. I'm in a lot of pain.
Let me just finish this

853
01:09:56,259 --> 01:09:57,458
and we can get
you checked out.

854
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:59,561
Don't patronize me.
Don't play dumb.

855
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:01,496
Look, I could go out
in the lobby there.

856
01:10:01,498 --> 01:10:03,765
I'm sure I could find
at least one or two homeboys

857
01:10:03,767 --> 01:10:05,733
that'd be more than happy
to help me score some dope.

858
01:10:05,735 --> 01:10:09,237
But I am not a junkie.
Look at me. I am not a junkie.

859
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:13,441
I'm just looking for
clinical-grade pharmaceuticals

860
01:10:13,443 --> 01:10:14,776
to ease my pain!

861
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:17,912
This is a hospital,
for Christ's sake, not a bodega!

862
01:10:17,914 --> 01:10:19,614
I'm not looking for Tylenol.

863
01:10:19,616 --> 01:10:21,216
Can you help me?

864
01:10:21,218 --> 01:10:22,951
Are you a nurse?
Are you a doctor?

865
01:10:22,953 --> 01:10:25,420
What the fuck are you?
Can you help?

866
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:09,364
Franny, what are you doing?

867
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:11,899
Franny.

868
01:11:13,836 --> 01:11:16,437
I'm here to see Toby.
I want to see him.

869
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:18,339
Franny, what happened to you?

870
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:21,843
Okay, I'm here. I'm he...

871
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:24,412
Toby?

872
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:27,548
Toby? Where is he?
Where is he?

873
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:30,518
Where's Toby?

874
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:35,790
I told him I'd be here. It's important.
He believes me when I tell him.

875
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:37,725
Toby.

876
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:40,361
Toby.

877
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:43,031
Hang on, where are you?

878
01:11:43,033 --> 01:11:45,600
Where is he?
Where's Toby?

879
01:11:45,602 --> 01:11:47,669
Where is he? What happened to him?
He was in there.

880
01:11:47,671 --> 01:11:50,905
Can you talk to me? You are useless.
I mean... Luke. Lukie!

881
01:11:50,907 --> 01:11:52,540
Come on, Luke.

882
01:11:52,542 --> 01:11:54,309
Luke! I want Luke!

883
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:57,412
Franny... Lukie!
I want... Get away from me!

884
01:11:57,414 --> 01:12:00,548
Who the fuck...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

885
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:02,083
Relax.

886
01:12:02,085 --> 01:12:04,585
Don't call the police!
We're fine!

887
01:12:04,587 --> 01:12:06,087
I want to know
who's responsible.

888
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:07,822
For what?
Tell me!

889
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:08,923
Toby? What?
Toby's fine!

890
01:12:08,925 --> 01:12:10,024
Toby's dead!

891
01:12:10,026 --> 01:12:11,092
No, he's not!
You're lying!

892
01:12:11,094 --> 01:12:14,562
He's not lying to you.
He's not lying to you. He's fine, all right?

893
01:12:14,564 --> 01:12:16,964
He's post op.
He doesn't need to be here. He's okay.

894
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,801
He's fine.
Show me.

895
01:12:19,803 --> 01:12:21,369
We're gonna take
five minutes, okay?

896
01:12:21,371 --> 01:12:22,603
All right, get him
out of here, please.

897
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:25,106
Let's move...
Come on.

898
01:12:32,782 --> 01:12:34,949
I'm not gonna try
and relate to you, franny.

899
01:12:35,918 --> 01:12:37,985
Because I can't, all right?

900
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:39,987
I don't think anyone can.

901
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:42,657
But you need help.

902
01:12:42,659 --> 01:12:44,125
All right?
You're a morphine addict.

903
01:12:44,127 --> 01:12:45,860
And that is not
your biggest problem.

904
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:49,997
So either you go get help,
or you stay the fuck away from my family.

905
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:51,666
Do you understand me?

906
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:56,037
Did you say something to her?

907
01:12:56,472 --> 01:12:58,573
What?
Did you say something to her?

908
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:01,642
Did you say...
Do you think you can get between her and me?

909
01:13:01,644 --> 01:13:03,945
Did you say something?
You think it's gonna help? Because it's not.

910
01:13:03,947 --> 01:13:06,681
She wants me in her life.
She wants you?

911
01:13:06,683 --> 01:13:09,450
And you've got a problem, buddy.
You are jealous.

912
01:13:09,452 --> 01:13:11,419
And you're weak and you can't
do anything on your...

913
01:13:11,421 --> 01:13:13,421
How do you think you got here?
Because I said so.

914
01:13:13,423 --> 01:13:15,456
You have a job
because I said so.

915
01:13:15,692 --> 01:13:19,160
You can't even take care
of your family without me.

916
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:21,996
Do you wanna
get me fired, huh?

917
01:13:21,998 --> 01:13:24,732
You wanna get me fired?
Go ahead, all right?

918
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:26,934
I don't want a thing
from you, all right?

919
01:13:26,936 --> 01:13:28,136
We don't need you.

920
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:33,808
You don't have problems.

921
01:13:34,109 --> 01:13:36,477
You don't have real
problems.

922
01:13:36,612 --> 01:13:41,482
Just because you give and give and give
doesn't make you a part of anything.

923
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:44,051
It just gives you an
excuse to be a coward.

924
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:46,521
You are not a good person.

925
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:48,523
You're a junkie with guilt.

926
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:50,825
Look at you.

927
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:53,828
Were you always
like this, franny?

928
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:19,220
Franny.

929
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:43,010
Franny.

930
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,149
I can see you, franny.

931
01:14:49,084 --> 01:14:50,251
What?

932
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:57,592
I'm coming.

933
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:02,997
Hey!

934
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:07,168
Hey! Hey, all right. Come on in.
What're you doing here?

935
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:09,237
Come on. Hey.

936
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:17,245
Hey, I'm sorry about the mess.
I don't know what happened. I just...

937
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:20,815
You need to get help, franny.

938
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:22,950
What?

939
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:24,986
I want to help you.

940
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:27,088
I want to be here
for you this time.

941
01:15:27,090 --> 01:15:30,258
Aah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
No, you're not.

942
01:15:34,763 --> 01:15:36,163
We're moving out
of the house.

943
01:15:40,769 --> 01:15:42,169
We don't belong there.

944
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:44,839
We're leaving.
Wa... wait a minute, wait a minute.

945
01:15:44,841 --> 01:15:46,307
You can't...

946
01:15:46,843 --> 01:15:50,144
You just need some time, make it your own.
It's not new for me.

947
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:54,081
I know what you're doing.

948
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:58,886
We shouldn't have
started this. It's my fault.

949
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:01,055
I just want to make things right.
I'm sorry.

950
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:03,324
I just want to make
things right.

951
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:05,626
I can't have you
in my baby's life.

952
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:09,297
Not like this.

953
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:14,869
When I was a kid,
i looked up to you.

954
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:20,775
What happened?

955
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,783
You're not the only one
who lost them.

956
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:35,222
I'm ready to help you.

957
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:41,729
But I will not keep feeling
sorry for you.

958
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:44,932
You need to grow up.

959
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:50,104
I need to grow up?

960
01:16:51,139 --> 01:16:53,741
I need to grow up?

961
01:16:57,946 --> 01:17:01,082
What right do you have
to come into my house

962
01:17:01,084 --> 01:17:03,217
and speak to me like that?

963
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:10,691
You're just a little girl
that got knocked up.

964
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:12,159
You're not a Princess.

965
01:17:13,997 --> 01:17:17,965
You want space? Go on, take your space.
Get out of here.

966
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:19,934
Get out of here.
Get out of here!

967
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:22,269
You're not Mia
and you'll never be Mia.

968
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:55,369
Poodles!

969
01:17:56,138 --> 01:17:58,439
Poodles, wait!

970
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:02,910
Poodles, I'm so sorry, okay?
Stop, stop.

971
01:18:03,311 --> 01:18:05,413
Poodles! Stop, honey.

972
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:07,381
Stop! I'm so sorry.

973
01:18:07,383 --> 01:18:10,117
Stop. You're right.
You're right.

974
01:18:10,119 --> 01:18:11,919
I'm just a fucking loser.

975
01:18:11,921 --> 01:18:13,921
Look at me. I'm just...

976
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:17,391
What's that?
What's wrong?

977
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:19,794
What's the matter?
What happened?

978
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:23,431
Wait a minute. Are you okay?
Just get me to the doctor.

979
01:18:34,476 --> 01:18:36,277
Hey, do you know
where Luke is?

980
01:18:36,745 --> 01:18:39,447
Franny... franny, we can't have this again.
No, no, no, no, no.

981
01:18:39,449 --> 01:18:40,881
No, I'm past that.

982
01:18:40,883 --> 01:18:43,984
I know. I'm disgusting and
my problems are petty. Yes.

983
01:18:43,986 --> 01:18:46,087
And I gotta work on my...

984
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:50,091
My coping skills, I know that.
But Olivia's down in the er.

985
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:51,959
I gotta find Luke.

986
01:18:56,164 --> 01:18:57,498
That was an apology,
you got that, right?

987
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:00,367
Dr. Harris.

988
01:19:02,204 --> 01:19:03,337
Yeah?

989
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:05,906
Jesus Christ.

990
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:07,241
Hey!
You kidding me, franny?

991
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:09,176
Toby! Hey, man.

992
01:19:09,178 --> 01:19:10,978
Good to see you.
You're looking good.

993
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:12,780
What are you doing here,
franny?

994
01:19:13,014 --> 01:19:14,315
Olivia's down in the er.

995
01:19:14,317 --> 01:19:16,283
She wants to see you.
She'd like to see you.

996
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:19,220
What? She needs to see you.
It's all right.

997
01:19:19,222 --> 01:19:22,523
She's fine. It's just she...
She's with a doctor. What happened?

998
01:19:22,525 --> 01:19:23,924
She might be in labor.

999
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:32,133
You know,
i wasn't always like this.

1000
01:19:32,834 --> 01:19:34,335
I used to be pretty cool.

1001
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:36,904
Yeah, I'll take
your word for it.

1002
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:39,774
Thanks for taking care
of this.

1003
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:41,842
Hey.
What?

1004
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:45,546
Am I too old for rehab?

1005
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:49,150
You're too old for Molly.

1006
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:56,157
Yeah.

1007
01:20:26,888 --> 01:20:28,055
Mr. watts.

1008
01:20:29,424 --> 01:20:32,293
Mr. watts.

1009
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:34,195
Everything okay?

1010
01:20:34,396 --> 01:20:35,529
It's a boy.

1011
01:20:36,965 --> 01:20:38,065
A boy?

1012
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:41,035
Yeah, he's just a little bit early,
but everything's fine.

1013
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:42,436
They asked to see you.

1014
01:20:45,874 --> 01:20:47,341
They did?
Yeah.

1015
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:04,458
This is Robert.

1016
01:21:07,496 --> 01:21:08,929
Is he a Robert?

1017
01:21:09,497 --> 01:21:10,865
Yeah, you wanna meet him?

1018
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:15,936
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1019
01:21:16,271 --> 01:21:17,338
Come on.

1020
01:21:33,188 --> 01:21:34,288
Wow.

1021
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:39,994
Could I have a moment
with him?

1022
01:21:40,962 --> 01:21:42,229
A moment?
Yeah.

1023
01:21:43,131 --> 01:21:44,431
Uh, yeah, sure.

1024
01:22:17,299 --> 01:22:19,300
I'm so sorry, Bobby.

1025
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,070
I'm so sorry.

1026
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:28,609
Mr. watts?
