1
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:13,640
Small fry,
and here's your toy.

2
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,519
A Zurg belt buckle?
Can I get a Buzz Lightyear instead?

3
00:00:17,602 --> 00:00:18,686
We're all out of Buzzes.

4
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,355
Well, can she have that one?

5
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:22,148
I'm sorry, those are for display only.

6
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:24,692
Thanks anyways.
Come on, Bonnie.

7
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:27,320
See? I told you we're never gonna get
played with.

8
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:28,988
But we're just here to sell chicken.

9
00:00:29,072 --> 00:00:30,406
- All right! Ball pit!
- Hey, hey, wait a minute.

10
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:32,116
Splash!

11
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:36,204
I think I just found our ticket
to playtime. Come on, let's go!

12
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:39,666
I better not. I don't wanna get in
trouble with the chicken people.

13
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,751
Fine. You stay here
with the belt buckle.

14
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,756
Me, I'm gonna get played with!
See ya, Zurgy!

15
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:49,592
Oh, boy.

16
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:52,136
Oh, no! Hot lava!

17
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:57,475
- Splash!
- Come on, Bonnie!

18
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:58,643
Coming!

19
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,186
I love playtime!

20
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:02,480
It's a little unsanitary, but... Ho!

21
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:16,411
Hi, everybody! We're home!

22
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,205
Hey, welcome back!
How was Poultry...

23
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:21,457
Ugh! What smells like chicken fingers?

24
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,130
I'm Buzz Lightyear. I come in peace.

25
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:28,965
Uh... What happened to Buzz?

26
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:32,176
He says the plastic in the ball pit
made him shrink!

27
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,344
Yeah, yeah, that's right, Tex.

28
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:34,971
Say, when's the playtime start
around here?

29
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:38,057
All right, where's the real Buzz?

30
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,148
Blast.

31
00:01:57,911 --> 00:01:59,412
Well, hello!

32
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:03,666
Welcome to the support group for
discarded Fun Meal toys.

33
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:07,795
We're just about to begin. T-Bone?
Would you find him a seat?

34
00:02:08,588 --> 00:02:09,714
Right this way, sir.

35
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:12,592
I think there's been a mistake.

36
00:02:12,717 --> 00:02:14,719
You see, I was just left in the ball pit,
and I...

37
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:17,722
Oh, we've all been left in the ball pit
of life, haven't we?

38
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:20,058
Yes, Tae-Kwon Doe?
You have a question?

39
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:23,311
What? Oh, I'm sorry, this is just
my play feature. Hi-yah!

40
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:26,481
That's super. Now, why don't we just
go around the room

41
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:29,067
and introduce ourselves?
My name is Neptuna.

42
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,069
Hi, Neptuna.

43
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:35,239
I was from the <i>Mermaid</i>
<i>Battle Squadron</i> tie-in. Summer '98.

44
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:38,076
I was thrown away, and that's okay.

45
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,536
I'm T-Bone, leader of the Steak Force.

46
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,414
We battled the Vegi-Tanarians
for dinner table dominance.

47
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:45,875
Well, I never got played with.

48
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:49,170
G'day. The name's Koala Kopter from
the Down-Underables.

49
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,506
I got swapped for a Kangaroo Kanoe!

50
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:55,259
My name is Recycle Ben
and I got recycled!

51
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,388
I don't get it.
Why don't the kids like me?

52
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:01,265
I'm like history, but on wheels!

53
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:04,519
Nobody wanted to board
the Vampire Express.

54
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:09,315
My name is Roxy Boxy.
I was recalled because...

55
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,775
- Whoo!
- Oh! Sorry.

56
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:12,860
I mean, who wants to see
an accurate depiction

57
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:14,028
of the human nervous system

58
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:15,363
when they're chowing down
on a burger!

59
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:18,700
Kid not like Pizza Bot. Pizza Bot sad.

60
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:21,494
- My name is Buzz.
- Hi, Buzz.

61
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:22,829
And I need to go.

62
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:25,206
Wait, don't run away from your
problems, brother.

63
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:26,916
Look, I need to get back to my friends.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,003
We're your friends now, Buzz.
Look around you.

65
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:32,797
We've all been discarded
and we need to stick together.

66
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,757
- Isn't that right, Super Pirate?
- Yar.

67
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:37,844
<i>The playtime's coming super soon</i>
<i>Doo-dah, doo-dah</i>

68
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:40,680
Guys, I'm telling you,
this is the real Buzz!

69
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:42,015
<i>Doo-doo-didley-doo-doo-doo</i>
<i>Oh, playtime day</i>

70
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:44,100
Rex, he's like three inches tall.

71
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,019
Yeah, but he's a pretty good ice dancer.

72
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:47,145
Whoa!

73
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:49,480
Well, I'm gonna go find out
what happened to our friend.

74
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,649
Yoo-hoo! Little Buzz guy!

75
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:53,151
<i>Oh, playtime day</i>

76
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:54,444
Listen, about this playtime...

77
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,195
Playtime? Hey, I'll be the cowboy!

78
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:58,031
Hey! Come back here!

79
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:01,951
Get along, little piggy! Hee-haw!

80
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:04,495
Could somebody tackle him, please?

81
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:05,913
<i>Playtime is your friend</i>

82
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:07,165
Thank you.

83
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:12,962
Even though I have been
thrown away, I am not garbage.

84
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:16,132
How am I gonna get up there?

85
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:19,802
All right, everyone, this is a good
time for some re-enactment therapy.

86
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:21,596
Let's break into groups of two.

87
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:25,391
And let's have Beef Stewardess with
Ghost Burger.

88
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,685
Bozu the Ninja Clown
with Funky Monk.

89
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:28,770
Wassup?

90
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:31,898
- And then Condorman with DJ Blu-Jay.
- All right!

91
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,859
Lizard Wizard?
I'm gonna put you with Buzz.

92
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:38,446
Now Buzz, you are a child who has
received this toy.

93
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:40,156
Pick him up and play with him.

94
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:43,034
- Oh, boy. Play, play, play.
- Oh.

95
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:47,163
Good. Now, to simulate
the abandonment, discard him.

96
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,040
- What?
- And walk over there

97
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,209
next to Gary Grappling Hook.

98
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:52,335
Gary Grappling Hook?

99
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:54,128
Hey there.

100
00:04:54,212 --> 00:04:57,632
So, wouldn't it be more
devastating if I left the room?

101
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:00,885
Oh, what a fabulous idea!
Thank you, Buzz.

102
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:02,136
Gary, do you mind?

103
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,681
Yeah, sure, whatever.
Whoa! Oh, yeah! Whee!

104
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:07,892
That was awesome.

105
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,229
Now, how did that make you feel?

106
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:17,360
Well, let's see now. It made me happy
when I was played with,

107
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:20,863
- but sad when he left.
- Good.

108
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,199
Okay, good, hold that thought.

109
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,034
We're going to have Buzz
come back in now.

110
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,786
Buzz?

111
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:31,165
- Uh, he left.
-  No!

112
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:36,003
Okay. To save Buzz, we need to find
a way to get inside Poultry Palace.

113
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:40,007
So, I used to work at Poultry Palace.
You like honey mustard sauce?

114
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:41,425
Yeah, you do.

115
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:43,719
Come on, guys, think.
How do we get inside?

116
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,638
We could jimmy the lock.

117
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,140
Let's act our way in!

118
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:49,976
Oh! We could drive a truck through
the front door!

119
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:52,854
- Or, you could use the drive-through.
- Buzz!

120
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:53,980
You're back!

121
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:56,941
So, what do you have to say for
yourself, Space Ranger?

122
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,779
I've done some things that
I'm not proud of.

123
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:05,908
I've spent a lot of playtime thinking I
was the prize that came with the meal,

124
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,202
but with the help of my sponsor,

125
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:12,707
I know now that the real prize is inside
of each and every one of us.

126
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:16,627
Oh! Sorry.

127
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,878
Oh, that was a good one.

128
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:02,340
Belt Buckle,
you crack me up sometimes.
