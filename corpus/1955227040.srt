00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:45,599
What are you doing?

188
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:48,001
What have you done!

189
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,637
OK, master Jason.

190
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:51,304
I love this part.

191
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,974
Watch this.

192
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:59,580
(ON TV): And people eat these
[inaudible] bacteria in it.

193
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,817
So the master plan
will be perceived.

194
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:04,618
[Inaudible]

195
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:13,293

196

(SINGING) This
is it, this is it.

197
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:18,265
This is life the one I got.

198
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:22,502
So just... just eh.

199
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:37,250
Morning, Brian.

200
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,819
Boy, do I feel great.

201
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,621
There is nothing,
and I mean nothing,

202
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:43,791
Like a beautiful, bright,
sunny Sunday morning.

203
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:46,126
I'm going to go take a shower
and enjoy this awesome day.

204
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:46,927
Really?

205
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,128
You have plans for today?

206
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,162
No, not really.

207
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,363
Probably just play
Atari all day.

208
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,799
Maybe open up the window.

209
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,934
Enjoy the fresh air.

210
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:54,802
Ah.

211
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:56,637
What a great day!

212
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,138
Yeah.

213
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,607
(SINGING) This is it.

214
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:01,108
This is it.

215
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,610
Ba ba loo!

216
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,077
Ba ba loo!

217
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,079
If you have it!

[Phone ringing]

220
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:18,959
Hello?

221
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:19,760
Brian.

222
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,161
Hey, Ken, what's up?

223
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,630
Hey, how'd things
go last night?

224
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,864
She say yes?

225
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,498
Y'all set a date yet?

226
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,801
No, things did not go as
smoothly as I had hoped.

227
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,602
What?

228
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,437
She turned you down?

229
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:31,605
Nah, it's not that.

230
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:32,806
I never got the
chance to ask her.

231
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:33,841
Things were going great.

232
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:35,442
And then guess who
happened to ruin it?

233
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:36,543
Buttcrack.

234
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:38,011
Yeah, Wade.

235
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:39,813
I swear, I am really
starting to hate him.

236
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,548
I am counting the days
till the semester is over.

237
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,583
And then, he is out of here.

238
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:44,918
I'm gonna get myself
a decent roommate.

239
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:46,019
Hell, Annie can move in.

240
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:46,854
So what did he do?

241
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:48,121
Wouldn't he shut up?

242
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:49,256
Shit.

243
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:50,057
Him and his damn butt.

244
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,324
Let me ask you something.

245
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,326
Is it so hard for a guy to
keep his pants pulled up?

246
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,395
I mean, the least he
could do is wear a belt.

247
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:56,930
Yeah, well, it
could be he doesn't

248
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,531
Realize he has a problem.

249
00:09:58,632 --> 00:09:59,700
You know, preacher
man, Bob, always

250
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,735
Says he with the
problem is usually

251
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:02,970
The last to know about it.

252
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,437
Yeah, I suppose I
could talk to him.

253
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:05,305
Tell him he has to do
something about that.

254
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:06,139
Oh, yeah.

255
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,607
That wouldn't hurt.

256
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,376
I would like to have Annie
come over once in a while

257
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:10,978
Without being grossed out.

258
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:12,512
I mean, what's the
point in having

259
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,849
A house if you can't have
your lady over once in awhile.

260
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,350
I suppose I could visit
her at the dorm room.

261
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,486
But how much privacy
can we get there?

262
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:20,854
Yeah, tell me about it.

263
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,322
So you gonna pop the
question tonight?

264
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,958
If I can get her
over here I will.

265
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:26,326
I want everything
to be just right.

266
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,260
Nice wine.

267
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,061
Nice dinner.

268
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:28,929
Everything, you know?

269
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,131
Oh, yeah.

270
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,133
Yeah, I don't know if she'd
take another night of buttcrack

271
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,201
In my way, though.

272
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,837
Listen, don't worry about that.

273
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:37,938
Invite Annie over.

274
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:40,373
And I promise, I'll
get Wade out of there.

275
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,142
I'll take him to a
movie or something.

276
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:43,476
Really?

277
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:44,678
Cool.

278
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:46,279
Tell buttcrack I'll be
over there about 6 o'clock

279
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,280
To pick him up.

280
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,181
Cool.

281
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,116
All right.
See ya.

282
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:49,917
Bye.

283
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:50,718
Bye.

284
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,456
Boy, do I feel all
fresh and clean.

285
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:57,490
Hey, Wade.

286
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,893
I was just talking
to Ken on the phone.

287
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,929
He said tonight he's going
to take you to a movie.

288
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:02,863
Ken?

289
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:03,697
What movie?

290
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:04,698
And why?

291
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:05,498
I don't know.

292
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:06,566
Any movie you want, I guess.

293
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,400
I don't know.

294
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,702
Sounds, kind of, weird to me.

295
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:09,837
Look, he ain't gay or nothing.

296
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:11,471
He just wants to go to movie.

297
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,506
You know, male
bonding and stuff.

298
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,975
Just go.

299
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:15,809
Well, OK.

300
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,377
But I get to choose the movie.

301
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:18,278
Yeah, sure.

302
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:19,279
Whatever.

303
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,347
(SINGING)There's a
rock n roll demon.

304
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,815
And he's coming for your soul.

305
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,084
I'm a rock n roll demon and
I'm coming for your soul.

306
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:24,885
God.

307

00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:38,065
Hey, Brian.

310
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:39,032
I just thought of something.

311
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,067
What?

312
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,634
My sister's coming
into town next week.

313
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,436
Do you want anything from her?

314
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,337
I'm sure I don't, Wade.

315
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,806
Are you sure?

316
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:47,540
You know she did
me up real good.

317
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,143
I really don't need to
know these things, Wade.

318
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:53,280
No, I'm talking about voodoo,
witchcraft, that kind of thing.

319
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,581
She studies it.

320
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,016
You see and she cast
this spell on me.

321
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,118
And now I get really good
grades in school the time

322
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,953
And never have to crack a book.

323
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,956
And it's great because it leaves
more time for Atari that way.

324
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,858
Could she put a spell on you
to make your pants stay up?

325
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,093
That's all I really need.

326
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,831
No, seriously.

327
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,099
She could cast a spell
on Annie that would

328
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,400
Make her fall in love with you.

329
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,868
And then, she wouldn't
be running out on you

330
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:15,869
All the time.

331
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:16,703
Come on, you'd like that.

332
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:17,838
Wouldn't you?

333
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:20,273
I really don't think I
need anything like that.

334
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,109
Well it don't cost nothing.

335
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,244
She cast the same spell
on our cousin, Vernon.

336
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,613
And now he's married to this
girl with really big tits.

337
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:28,648
I mean, they're freaking huge!

338
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,551
And all it takes are some tears
from a pregnant with pink eye

339
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,120
And some vanilla extract.

340
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,387
But you can get that anywhere.

341
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,655
Wade, no!

342
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,456
OK.

343
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:37,590
All right.

344
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,592
But if you change your
mind, just let me know.

345
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,294
I'm going to go play more Atari.

346
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:42,429
OK.

347
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,531
(SINGING) Na, na, na,
gonna have a good time!

348
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:51,338
Jesus, Atari.

349
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,973
Get with the times.

350
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:54,141
What?

351
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:54,942
Nothing.

00:12:55,042 --> 00:13:00,313

354
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,222
Hello?

355
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,023
Wade?

356
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,658
Yeah, hold on.

357
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,226
Wade, it's for you.

358

Who is it?

359
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:14,928
I don't know.

360
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,396
Probably your sister.

361
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:17,197
OK.

362
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:27,040
Hello?

00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,008
Oh, hey, sis.

364
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:29,442
Oh no, everything's great.

365
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,378
Yeah, that was Brian.

366
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:32,645
Oh no, we're great friends.

367
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,082
We're just like brothers.

368
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:36,583
Yeah, I asked him.

369
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,618
No, he said he didn't want it.

370
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:39,786
Well yeah, I can ask him again.

371
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:40,720
Yeah, hold on.

372
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,122
Hey, hey, Brian.

373
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:42,990
No.

374
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:43,790
Uh, no.

375
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:45,358
He say's he's OK.

376
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,760
Yeah, so you're still
coming up on Saturday?

377
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:48,962
Oh, you're driving.

378
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:49,963
Oh, OK.

379
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:52,099
Well hey, I guess
I'll see you then.

380
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:55,268
OK, bye.

381
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,404
She says she's driving.

382
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,439
How long do you think
something like that would take?

383
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,540
Where's she coming from?

384
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,708
Louisiana.

385
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:03,010
Louisiana to Virginia?

386
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,544
That'll take a while.

387
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:06,779
She says she'll be
here on Saturday.

388
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,817
I'll probably go spend the
weekend at my mom's next week.

389
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:12,785
Hey Wade, you go
ahead and do that.

390
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,287
It won't be the same
around here without you.

391
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,723
But you do what you gotta so.

392
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,325
I think you and my
sister should meet.

393
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:19,759
I think you'd really
like each other.

394
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,729
I really do.

395
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:23,663
It's almost 6 o'clock.

396
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:24,597
Ken will be here soon.

397
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,632
You ready to go?

398
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:26,799
I'm ready.

399
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,868
I know exactly what
movie I want to see, too.

400
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:30,803
I still get to pick
the movie, don't I?

401
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:32,239
I mean, Ken wont
give me a hard time

402
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:35,208
About it will he because Hackman
Four just came out on Friday.

403
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:36,676
And I really want to see it.

404
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:38,178
And I was reading about it.

405
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,580
And in the first three, he
killed guys with a shovel.

406
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,182
In this one he kills
guys with a rake.

407
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,351
And I really want to see it.

408
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:45,652
I'm sure he won't mind.

409
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:46,786
[Knocking]

410
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,088
That's him.

411
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:48,888
Come in!

412
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,425
Hey.

413
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:53,893
Hey.

414
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:55,128
Hey, Ken, are you ready?

415
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,863
I want to go see Hackman Four.

416
00:14:56,964 --> 00:14:57,664
Is that OK?

417
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:59,266
It just came out on Friday.

418
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,368
Yeah, I been waiting a
long time to see that one.

419
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:02,302
Yeah, me too.

420
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,803
And you know, in
this one, he kills

421
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,105
Guys with a rake, not a shovel.

422
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:06,473
Oh, really.

423
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,707
Boy are the really developing
his character, aren't they?

424
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:08,841
Yeah, come on.
Let's go.

425
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:09,977
I don't want to
miss the previews.

426
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:12,479
All right.

427
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,948
[Music playing]

428
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,418
He's gone.

429
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:52,919
Now if Annie would just hurry.

430
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,127
Are we alone?

431
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:02,129
I promise you the
evening is all ours.

432
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:02,929
Good.

433
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,337
Sorry about last night.

434
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:11,871
I didn't mean to run out on you.

435
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,208
It's just that I was
feeling really sick.

436
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,976
Last night was last night.

437
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,379
Tonight is tonight.

438
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,148
Would you care for some wine?

439
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:21,948
Sure.

440
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,899
So what was this question you
wanted to ask me last night?

441
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:40,800
All in due time, Annie.

442
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,835
All in due time.

443
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,171
Cheers.

444
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:47,907
(SINGING) In a shanny shack
down by the railroad track.

445
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,510
That's where I met you baby.

446
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,345
You looked so sweet.

447
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,181
Wade, you want
to go get a drink

448
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:55,782
Or something after the movie?

449
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,384
Yeah, sure.

450
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,419
Hey, you moving
back to Louisiana

451
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,753
There with your sister?

452
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,021
I don't know.

453
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:03,456
It all depends on whether
Brian's willing to extend

454
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:04,657
My lease or not.

455
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:05,925
I really like it here.

456
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:06,759
Well you know, man.

457
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,894
That's the thing.

458
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:09,896
Brian is, kind of,
wanting Annie to move in.

459
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:10,930
That's OK, too.

460
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,699
I can always find a
new place to live.

461
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,768
Hey, I got to ask you question,
you know, just as a friend.

462
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,070
I hope you're not
offended or anything.

463
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,272
Man, you're not coming on
to me or anything, are ya?

464
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,141
This isn't going to
turn weird, is it?

465
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:23,443
Oh man, I always
knew you were gay.

466
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,577
What?
Gay?

467
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:25,612
I'm not gay.

468
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,947
Jeez, I just wanted
to know something.

469
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,449
Are you sure you're not gay?

470
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,783
I mean, the way
you talk and all.

471
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,119
What's wrong with
the way I talk?

472
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:34,654
I just wanted to know, you
know, why don't you wear a belt.

473
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:35,455
Well what do you mean?

474
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,256
You know, your pants.

475
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:37,257
They never stay up.

476
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:38,358
Your butt's always sticking out.

477
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,159
What do you mean?

478
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,427
You look at my butt?

479
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:41,394
You are gay, aren't you?

480
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:42,429
What?
No!

481
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:43,530
Yeah you are.

482
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,797
That's why you're always
looking at my butt!

483
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,333
Man, you shouldn't be
looking at my butt.

484
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:48,135
You should be looking
at girls butts.

485
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,569
You're a sicko!

486
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,104
Maybe if you keep
your damn pants up

487
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:52,972
I wouldn't be seeing
your butt all the time.

488
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,341
You know, you have
a problem, Wade.

489
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:56,243
And as a friend, I just thought
you should know about it.

490
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:57,810
Man, just stop the car.

491
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,711
I'll walk home.

492
00:17:58,811 --> 00:17:59,546
You're a pervo!

493
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:00,580
Forget I said anything.

494
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,514
Let's just go see the movie.
No, man.

495
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:02,515
Stop the car.

496
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,684
Find yourself
another boy toy, man.

497
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:05,718
I'm going home.

498
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:06,653
Wade.

499
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:07,954
Wade.

500
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,857
Look, I just can't give
you things that you want.

501
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:11,924
Goodbye!

502
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:12,725
Wade!

503
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,735
Shit.

504
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:23,536
Sorry, Brian.

505
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,989
You know, I think
I know what this

506
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,724
Question you want to ask me is.

507
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:48,161
So you may as well
go ahead and ask.

508
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:51,498
I already know what the
answers going to be.

509
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:52,899
I'll ask soon.

510
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:53,700
After dinner.

511
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,667
After we dance.

512
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:55,968
Dancing huh?

513
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,404
Mm hm.

514
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:59,806
What kind of dancing?

515
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:00,773
We'll be standing up.

516
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:04,177
It'll be the kind I like.

517
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:05,945
Well we'll start in
the vertical position

518
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:09,249
But we don't have
to stay that way.

519
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,050
Mm, I get goosebumps
just thinking about it.

520
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:15,588
To your bumps.

521
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:16,956

Burn you up with desire.

Hey, boy!

527
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,005
Pull your pants up you
dumb son of a bitch!

00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:40,046
Wow, Brian.

You're a great cook.

530
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,216
That was really fantastic.

531
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:52,625
This can wait.

532
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,071
I love you, Brian.

Will you marry me?

Oh, Brian.

Can I dance with you guys?

Churn the milk and
make it butter!

548
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:57,824
Wade, what are doing?

549
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:58,791
You're supposed to
be at the movies.

550
00:20:58,891 --> 00:20:59,726
Churn the milk
and make it butter.

551
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:00,827
Churn the milk and
make it butter.

552
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:01,761
Damn it, Wade!

553
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:04,063
Can't I have any
moment without you?

554
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:05,197
Churn the milk and
make it butter.

555
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:06,566
Annie, are you OK?

556
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,435
Churn the milk
and make it butter.

557
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:09,836
Churn the milk and
make it butter.

558
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,538
Hey, what are you doing?

559
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:12,472
I'm dancing here.

560
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:13,606
I'm in the groove.

561
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,408
And when the music
calls, you got to answer.

562
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:19,746
Ewe, that's vomit!

563
00:21:19,846 --> 00:21:21,514
Your girlfriend's gross.

564
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:22,615
Don't worry about
it, Annie, OK?

565
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:23,650
What'd you do that for?

566
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,451
I was in the groove.

567
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:26,553
The music just took me away.

568
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:27,687
Fuck you, Wade!

569
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,088
Annie and I were
having a great evening.

570
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:29,789
You're supposed to
be out with, Ken!

571
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,123
That's another thing.

572
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,860
I don't appreciate being pimped
out to your pervo friends!

573
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,894
That guys a flamer, I tell ya!

574
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:35,828
And I'm just not that way!

575
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:36,696
What?
Ken?

576
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:37,497
He is not!

577
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:38,798
Yeah, right.

578
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,700
That's why he went on and
on all night about my butt!

579
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,570
I'm just not comfortable with
guys looking at me like that!

580
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:47,239
I'd rather have girls like
Annie looking at my butt.

581
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,040
Uh!

582
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,843
What'd you cook.

583
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:51,944
Jesus, Wade.

584
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,913
Oh, I really have to go.

585
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:55,147
I'm sorry, Annie.

586
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:58,117
I planned for this
evening to be so special.

587
00:21:58,217 --> 00:21:58,951
It's not your fault!

588
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:04,391
Boy, she really vomited good.

589
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,759
Must have gotten sick
from Brian's cooking.

590
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,596
He's a nice guy but
not much of a cook.

591
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:12,064
Uh, and all over my nice pants.

592
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,633
I need to take a bath.

593
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:14,634
Yeah, a bath.

594
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:20,807
(SINGING) I got a love handle!

595
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:22,609
Got a love handle!

596

Chicka boom, boom, boom.

597
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,344
Chicka boom, boom, boom.

598
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:27,647
Got a handle... on my love.

599
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:30,617
Let me wear you like
a glove, oh yeah.

600
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:31,918
Got a love handle.

601
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:32,785
Somebody help me.

602
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:33,686
(SINGING)Got a love handle.

Chicka boom, boom, boom.

604
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,594
Hey, Brian, I took one of
your t-shirts cause mine

605
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:42,895
Had puke all over it.

606
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:43,730
Are you happy, Wade?

607
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,533
Do you like screwing up my life?

608
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:47,867
I never screwed up your life.

609
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:49,268
You screwed up your life.

610
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,204
I ain't do nothing!

611
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,473
No.

612
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:55,708
I'm not going to say anything.

613
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:56,876
The semesters almost over.

614
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:58,478
And I can have my life back.

615
00:22:58,578 --> 00:22:59,812
Have your life back?

616
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:02,314
I don't know what
you're talking about.

617
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:04,684
I'm going to go take a bath.

618
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:08,287
(SINGING) Put your beer
goggles on and make love to me.

619
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:13,560
Through those hazy shades,
I'm not so bad a fella.

620
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,561
My belly ain't so big.

621
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:15,528
My teeth ain't so yellow.

622
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:23,570
I can't believe he
actually shut up.

623
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,071
[Music playing]

624
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:31,978
Damn it!

625
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,946
I can't take it anymore!

626
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:35,414
[Music playing]

627
00:23:38,685 --> 00:23:39,385
God damn it!

628
00:23:39,486 --> 00:23:41,053
Would you shut the hell up!

629
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:41,854
Ah!

630
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:42,822
You pervo!

631
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,156
What are you doing in here!

632
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,324
Go get your jollies
somewhere else!

633
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,293
I don't like guys
watching me in the tub!

634
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:50,262
Hell, I might let a girl watch
me in the tub, but not a guy.

635
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,109
[Knocking]

636
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:06,078
Huh.

637
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,179
Man, sorry about that.

638
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,548
Hope Wade didn't mess
anything up for you.

639
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:10,082
I did everything I
could to stop him.

640
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,984
And he just jumped
out of the car.

641
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:13,486
And tried turning
the car around.

642
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:14,286
It just died.

643
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:19,859
What's wrong?

644
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:20,760
What did Wade do?

645
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:27,466
What's that smell?

646
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:30,937
I didn't mean for it
to happen, I swear.

647
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:34,473
The radio just fell
out of my hand.

648
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:36,142
Something happen?

649
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:36,943
Bathroom.

650
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,956
So, like, what happened?

651
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:53,092
It slipped out of my hand.

652
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:54,493
The radio.

653
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:57,096
I was trying to
get it to shut off.

654
00:24:57,196 --> 00:25:00,266
And it slipped out of my hand.

655
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:02,468
That's OK You didn't
do it on purpose.

656
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:11,711
Hi, Mrs. Jenkins?

657
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:12,879
Ken here.

658
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:14,246
Yeah, Wade's friend.

659
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,815
Afraid I kind of
have some bad news.

660
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:18,685
I really don't quite
know how to put this.

661
00:25:18,785 --> 00:25:20,887
Evidently, Wade
was taking a bath.

662
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:24,090
Yeah, yeah, he's taking a bath
and listening to the radio.

663
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,291
What?

664
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:27,426
No, I don't know what
station he's listening to.

665
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,596
Anyway, the radio kind
of fell in the tub.

666
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:34,667
My boy, oh God, oh
God, my baby boy!

667
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:35,935
Yeah, I'm terribly sorry.

668
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:36,736
Yeah.

669
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:38,537
No, that won't be a problem.

670
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:41,473
Yeah, I fully understand.

671
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:44,543
Yeah, the coroners are
taking him away right now.

672
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:45,678
All right.

673
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,146
OK.

674
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:49,048
Bye-bye.

675
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:50,950
So I was here in the kitchen.

676
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,686
I was cleaning up some
vomit for my fiance who

677
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:56,388
Has been ill a little earlier.

678
00:25:56,488 --> 00:26:00,192
And suddenly, I didn't
hear the radio anymore.

679
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,962
And I heard a splash and the
sound of electricity buzzing.

680
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,331
And I knew right away
what had happened.

681
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:07,266
I always thought Wade
had more sense then

682
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,535
To put an electrical appliance
on the edge of a tub.

683
00:26:09,636 --> 00:26:12,772
But I don't know anything
about his upbringing.

684
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:16,075
I ran and unplugged the
extension cord immediately.

685
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:20,613
But when I went into the
bathroom, well, he was dead.

686
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:22,181
Yes, I see.

687
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:24,150
People should really
be more careful.

688
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,685
You know, they should
make public service

689
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:27,186
Announcements about that.

690
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:28,587
And during ballgames.

691
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:31,057
You know, really get the message
out there about being careful

692
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:33,860
With electricity when you're
taking a bath because it

693
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,895
Could have saved a life.

694
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:38,364
The life of your friend.

695
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,800
Well, Brian, I think
I have all I need.

696
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,770
If I need any more
questions, I'll be in touch.

697
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,408
That's, pretty
much, what happened.

698
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:51,177
Yeah, that was Wade's
mom on the phone.

699
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,545
She's, kind of, taking it hard.

700
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:54,914
God, what a day.

701
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:56,816
Yeah, she was wanting to come
up and get some of his stuff

702
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,550
But really didn't feel
up to it right now.

703
00:26:58,651 --> 00:26:59,886
She thought maybe
after the funeral.

704
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:00,687
That's OK.

705
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:01,487
Isn't it?

706
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:02,822
That's fine.

707
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:04,791
Those cops, they weren't
accusing you of anything,

708
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:05,758
Were they?

709
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:08,460
No, no, she believed
what I told her.

710
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,197
It wasn't my fault. It
slipped out of my hand.

711
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,264
You believe me, don't you?

712
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:13,065
Yeah, of course.

713
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:14,100
It really was an accident.

714
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,634
Hey, you don't need
to explain it to me.

715
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,103
Want me to call Annie for you?

716
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:17,904
That's all right.

717
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:20,639
I'll talk to her tomorrow.

718
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,941
I want to tell her myself.

719
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:22,909
Yeah.

720
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:24,243
Knowing Annie,
she's probably going

721
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:26,178
To want to run out and get a
marriage license right away,

722
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,848
And move in after Wade's gone.

723
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:31,217
That's a safe bet.

724
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,484
Thanks for calling his parents.

725
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:33,986
I couldn't handle that.

726
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:35,021
Yeah, it's no problem.

727
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:36,689
Better they heard
from us than the cops.

728
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,257
You know, preacher
man, Bob, always

729
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:40,292
Says better to
hear from a friend

730
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:41,193
Then some guy in a uniform.

731
00:27:45,131 --> 00:28:01,013
(SOBBING) My boy,
oh God, my baby boy.

732
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:03,549
Why did you have to
take him, oh Lord?

733
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:07,086
Why him and not his father?

734
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,288
Brothers and
sisters, our friend,

735
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:12,992
Our comrade, our brother
Wade, he did not have to die!

736
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:13,793
Amen.

737
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:16,495
He did not have to die!

738
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,430
Brother Wade did
not have to die!

739
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,200
Except, God has a plan for him.

740
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,403
God, in his infinite wisdom
and glory said, Wade,

741
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:25,337
This is your time.

742
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,273
Now is the time, brother Wade.

743
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,976
Brother Wade, get your
butt up here to heaven.

744
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:31,477
I know brother Wade is happy.

745
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:35,214
Oh Lord, he's happy that
his friends, and family,

746
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:36,916
And comrades, and
spiritual arms,

747
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:41,487
Have gathered here today to
send him on to the promise land.

748
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:42,789
I know you feel
good because brother

749
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:44,090
Wade's in a better place.

750
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,724
I know you're happy
for Brother Wade.

751
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:49,228
I know you're pleased that he's
gone to the kingdom of heaven!

752
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:50,963
Can I have an amen?

753
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,098
Amen.

754
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:53,766
Let me hear you say amen
brothers and sisters!

755
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:54,566
Amen.

756
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:55,768
I can't hear you!

757
00:28:55,868 --> 00:28:56,568
Say amen!

758
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:57,703
- Amen.
- Loud!

759
00:28:57,804 --> 00:28:58,504
Loud!

760
00:28:58,604 --> 00:28:59,305
Loud!

761
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,707
Loud!

762
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:03,342
Say amen, brothers and sisters!

763
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:05,577
Amen.

764
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:08,680
I don't know why God chose
to electrocute Wade the way

765
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:09,515
He did.

766
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:12,885
Brother Wade was taking a bath.

767
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:16,588
He was in a tub washing
off the impurities.

768
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:17,890
The dirt!

769
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,358
The filth!

770
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:20,726
The scum!

771
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:25,497
The vermin that each one of
us have in our earthly bodies.

772
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,498
He was taking a bath.

773
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,667
And the radio just
happened to jump.

774
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,002
Radio jumped!

775
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:34,540
It just... the radio jumped
into the tub with brother Wade!

776
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,975
And it electrocuted him.

777
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:37,910
It shriveled him all up.

778
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,279
I don't know why God chose
that path for brother Wade.

779
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,214
I can't understand it.

780
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:43,515
But God understands.

781
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,685
And Wade us with God.

782
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,420
Brother Wade is with God.

783
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,889
They're up in heaven.

784
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:52,391
And one day we're
going to go to heaven.

785
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:55,327
We're going to get on that
freight train of love.

786
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:56,728
That freight train of happiness!

787
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:58,164
We're going to go to heaven!

788
00:29:58,264 --> 00:29:59,565
And we're going to
see Brother Wade!

789
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:02,701
Do you want to see brother Wade
in heaven brothers and sisters?

790
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,635
Let me here you say amen!

791
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:04,436
Amen.

792
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:06,038
Let me here you say it loud!

793
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,006
Say it proud!

794
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:08,207
Amen!

795
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,842
Say amen brother Wade!

796
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:15,347
Amen.

797
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:17,950
God!

798
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:21,087
God bless this ground
that contains the shed

799
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:24,056
Off body of brother Wade.

800
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,591
Bless this whole area.

801
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:28,827
Bless this hole that
his body will lay into.

802
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:31,597
When we come to pay our
respects to brother Wade,

803
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:33,099
We will feel his
presence here among us.

804
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:34,733
And we loved him so.

805
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,868
Yes we did, God.

806
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:39,138
We loved brother Wade
so but now he is gone.

807
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:42,441
You gotta help me God.

808
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:46,378
Let us all now bow our heads in
silent prayer for brother Wade.

809
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:51,783
Amen.

810
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,128
You guys go back to the car.

811
00:31:02,228 --> 00:31:03,095
I'll be with you in a minute.

812
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,647
I saw what you did.

813
00:31:21,747 --> 00:31:22,681
What?

814
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:24,951
He didn't deserve
what you did to him.

815
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:26,618
I have no idea what you're...

816
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,287
You may be able
to fool the police.

817
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,621
But you can't fool me.

818
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,624
I saw you throw the radio in
the tub and kill my brother.

819
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,260
It slipped out of my hand.

820
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,494
It slipped out of your hand?

821
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:36,895
What were you doing
in the bathroom

822
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:38,530
When he was taking
a bath anyway?

823
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,466
I... he was-

824
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:41,900
He was taking a bath.

825
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:43,169
Look.

826
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:44,403
I'm sorry.

827
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,305
Wade was never very good
at standing up for himself.

828
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,941
But I'm going to see
that he does this time.

829
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,076
But I...

830
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:57,083
[Chanting] Buttcrack,
buttcrack, buttcrack,

831
00:31:57,183 --> 00:31:58,517
Buttcrack, buttcrack,
buttcrack, buttcrack,

832
00:31:58,617 --> 00:31:59,685
Buttcrack, buttcrack,
buttcrack, buttcrack, buttcrack.

833
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:00,519
Stop it!

834
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:02,588
Isn't that what you called him.

835
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:03,722
Isn't that what you called Wade?

836
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:04,523
Buttcrack?

837
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:09,761
Say it 12 times in one breath
and then just see what happens.

838
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:11,730
Look, this witchcraft mambo
jumbo voodoo doesn't scare me!

839
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,065
Just get out of my face with it!

840
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:24,843
[Chanting]

841
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:25,978
Brian.
Brian.

842
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:27,146
Yo, Brian.
Huh?

843
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:27,946
Hey, man.

844
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:28,747
Where'd you go?

845
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:29,615
Paris?

846
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:30,416
What [inaudible]?

847
00:32:30,516 --> 00:32:31,250
Hey, come on.

848
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,351
Annie's in a hurry to get back.

849
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:33,152
Some girl thing.

850
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:34,186
I don't know.

851
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,122
Yeah, let's get the
hell out of here.

852
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:44,396
You know that there were
a lot more people there

853
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:46,498
Than I thought there would be?

854
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:47,366
Really?

855
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,001
Hey, you want to watch some TV?

856
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:50,102
Sure.

857
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:51,370
I got dibs on the floor
next to the window.

858
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,779
Last year, over nine people
in the greater Arcola,

859
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:04,116
Virginia area alone died
as result of electrocution

860
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:05,484
In their own bathtub.

861
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:07,086
Don't be a statistic.

862
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:09,555
Keep your radio and all
other electrical appliances

863
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:12,124
Away from your tub and
any other areas of water.

864
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:15,827
Remember, bathing is important
but nothing to die for.

865
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:16,962
Didn't take long.

866
00:33:17,063 --> 00:33:18,430
Hey, you mind if I put
it on the biker channel?

867
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,298
I don't care.

868
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:20,599
Biker channel?

869
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:21,733
You're no biker.

870
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,370
Yeah, but they have
really good shows.

871
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,373
(ON TV): [inaudible] will return
right after these messages.

872
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:29,841
Used to be that when my old
lady got her monthly visitor,

873
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:31,277
I'd swear she used
to drive me crazy.

874
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:32,311
[Knocking]

875
00:33:32,411 --> 00:33:33,512
(ON TV): [inaudible]
Nagging and shit.

876
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,947
I swear to god, I thought
I was going to kill her.

877
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:42,254
Preacher man Bob, hi.

878
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,489
This is a pleasant surprise.

879
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:44,956
That was a beautiful
sermon you gave earlier.

880
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:47,726
Some of things you said, they
just touched me right here.

881
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:50,129
Brother Brian, that lifts
my spirits to hear that.

882
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:50,929
Can I come in?

883
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:51,930
Oh, sure.

884
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,731
Thanks.

885
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:59,037
So uh, what brings you by
here today preacher man Bob?

886
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:00,339
I just come by to
make sure that you

887
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:01,607
Kids are doing all right.

888
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:05,211
You know, the loss of a
friend is a very trying time.

889
00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:06,578
I want y'all to know
brother Wade is gone

890
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:08,880
To a far better place
then this ratchet

891
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,617
Earth we find our self on.

892
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,285
I know y'all are
in a lot of pain.

893
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:16,054
I know y'all have a lot
of loss in your heart.

894
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:19,825
I know you wish you could have
his round mounds of God loving

895
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:21,327
Pounds right here with you!

896
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:22,294
But you can't!

897
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:23,695
But you will see
brother Wade again.

898
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,431
You'll see him
again in paradise.

899
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:26,832
That's where you will see.

900
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:27,899
I know.

901
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:28,834
Can I get you something
preacher man Bob?

902
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:29,701
I have some apple juice.

903
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:30,502
No, no.

904
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:31,803
I don't want to impose.

905
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,173
I just came by to make sure
y'all are doing all right.

906
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:37,109
You know, I want to make sure
that your souls are at piece.

907
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:40,646
That you've been able to accept
the passing of your friend.

908
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:41,847
I'm here to offer guidance.

909
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:42,914
Spiritual counseling.

910
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,150
Do y'all need any?

911
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,984
Well I could use some guidance.

912
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,820
Brother Ken, I see
the pain in your eyes.

913
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,356
I know that it's hurting you.

914
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:53,359
But preacher man Bob, I
am going to help you son.

915
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:54,626
I'm going to help ya!

916
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:55,561
Thank you preacher man Bob.

917
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:56,828
You know what we ought to do?

918
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,630
Let's go to the
kitchen, get a beer,

919
00:34:58,730 --> 00:34:59,831
And get it on with the Lord!

920
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,468
Come on, boy!

921
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:04,470
You know, I don't
mean this bad.

922
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:08,140
But I'm on a hard
time missing Wade.

923
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,776
It's just that it's so nice
here without his buttcrack

924
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:13,011
Getting in our way.

925
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:13,812
Yeah, you're right.

926
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:16,382
I feel, kind of, bad though.

927
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:17,883
He might've could've
been somebody if he just

928
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:19,185
Learned to keep his pants up.

929
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:20,652
You never know.

930
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:21,687
I don't know.

931
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,522
Once a buttcrack,
always a buttcrack,

932
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,924
Their are buttcracks in
this world like he was.

933
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:28,026
People who don't have enough
sense to keep their pants

934
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,929
Pulled up to cover their private
parts like their buttcracks.

935
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:32,130
And then, there
are non-buttcracks.

936
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:34,700
People like us who have
enough sense not to show

937
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,202
Our buttcracks to the world.

938
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:37,403
I mean, after all,
who wants to look

939
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:38,770
At another persons buttcrack?

940
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,606
I know I don't want to
look at peoples buttcrack.

941
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:42,274
I think buttcrack
is a state of mind.

942
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:44,376
You either have enough sense
to hide your buttcrack.

943
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,077
Or you're too stupid to
realize that everyone

944
00:35:46,178 --> 00:35:47,713
Can see your buttcrack.

945
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:53,051
When I think of Wade, all that
comes to mind is his buttcrack.

946
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,455
Ooh, I go to remember to
breath when I go on like that.

947
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:58,457
My mom always said I
could be long winded.

948
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,499
(SOBBING) Oh, my boy.

949
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,300
My, boy.

950
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:11,803
That's all right, mama.

951
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:14,840
We'll just make us
another baby boy.

952
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,641
(SOBBING).

953
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:26,151
I'm gonna go for a drive.

954
00:36:26,252 --> 00:36:27,586
I need some fresh air.

955
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:01,520
(SINGING) [inaudible].

956
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:10,929
Man, people like
that ought to be shot.

957
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:12,431
Hey, buttcrack!

958
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:15,867
Pull your damn pants up!

959
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,369
Man, what if I was
driving here with my mama?

960
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:20,071
She don't want to look
at that kind of stuff.

961
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:21,273
That's just disgusting!

962
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:22,574
Country folk like me don't
like that kind of stuff.

963
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:25,977
I'm gonna teach that
asshole a lesson.

964
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,514
(SINGING) I love my
crazy little [inaudible].

965
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:31,116
Hey, buttcrack!

966
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:32,818
Buttcrack!

967
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:33,585
Hey, buttcrack!

968
00:37:33,685 --> 00:37:35,921
I'm talking to you!

969
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:38,056
I'm talking to you,
you piece of shit!

970
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:41,860
Oh, so that's how
its going to be, huh?

971
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,828
What are trying to do?

972
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,195
Gross the whole
fucking world off?

973
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:48,600
Pull your god damn pants up
you retarded son of a dick wad!

974
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,968
Come on, buttcrack!

975
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:51,737
Come on, boy.
Oh, yeah.

976
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:52,671
Come on now!

977
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,340
Come on now!

978
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,674
(SINGING) Follow
that drinking gourd.

979
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,910
I just had about
enough of you, boy!

980
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,045
Oh, god, the humanity!

981
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,719
What the... mama!

982
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:09,187
Mama!

983
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,188
Mama!

984
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,657
Mama, my face is melting!

985
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:14,326
Mama!

986
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:15,727
(SOBBING) My face is melting!

987
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:17,128
It's melting!
It's melting, mama!

988
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:18,063
My face!

989
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:22,401
It's melting!

990
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:23,369
My face is melting!

991
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:25,437
It's melting!

992
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:27,038
(SINGING) Drinking gourd.

993
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,874
God is in the flowers!

994
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:30,342
God is in the trees!

995
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:32,578
God is in Troy Aikman's knee!

996
00:38:32,678 --> 00:38:34,680
God is in Chevy Nova's!

997
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,915
God is in the little tiny hairs
hanging off your [inaudible],

998
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:37,749
Ken!

999
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:40,151
God is everywhere, young man!

1000
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,154
Is he in urine?

1001
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,590
God is in Pepsi Cola!

1002
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,558
God is in everything!

1003
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:50,562
God is in the Trident
Sugarless Gum.

1004
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,198
God is in... he's in my shoes!

1005
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:54,500
He's in my pants!

1006
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,767
He's making me do a
little tiny dance!

1007
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:57,202
God's everywhere!

1008
00:38:57,302 --> 00:38:58,604
He's in the sand at the beach!

1009
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:00,005
He's in the sky
He's on the floor!

1010
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:01,373
He's everywhere!

1011
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:02,173
He's underground!

1012
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:03,108
Overground!

1013
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:04,710
He's over the top,
battle royale.

1014
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,478
God is your friend!

1015
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:09,481
You know, Brian, we've got
our marriage license, right?

1016
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:10,716
Yeah.

1017
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:12,451
Well I why don't if you
wanted a big fancy ceremony

1018
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:13,485
Or anything.

1019
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:16,622
But if you just want
to keep it simple,

1020
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:18,757
Preacher man Bob is here.

1021
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,626
Maybe we can ask him if
he'd do it right now.

1022
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:22,628
What do you think?

1023
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:24,295
Yeah, you know,
that's not a bad idea.

1024
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:25,296
Let's do it.

1025
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:27,065
Brian, I'm so excited.

1026
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:29,935
I love you.

1027
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,470
Satan is after your
soul, young man.

1028
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,672
Satan wants to get you I'm
a Satan hating preacher!

1029
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:34,906
I am preacher man Bob!

1030
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:36,241
And you got to avoid him!

1031
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:38,977
You got to keep away from his
dastardly ways, young man!

1032
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:40,078
Do you here me?

1033
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:42,848
Is Satan everywhere
too preacher man Bob?

1034
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:43,715
Oh, he thinks he is!

1035
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:45,050
Satan thinks he's a bad man!

1036
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,118
He's walking through the
forest of life right now going,

1037
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,053
I'm bad.
I'm Satan.

1038
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:49,187
Satan is not doo doo.

1039
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:50,489
Satan is not the crap.

1040
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:52,458
He's in chainsaws that are
tearing up the rain forest.

1041
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:53,425
Satan in it acid rain.

1042
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:54,526
What?
What?

1043
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:55,326
Speak, son.

1044
00:39:55,427 --> 00:39:56,194
Is he in urine?

1045
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:01,032
You got to keep Satan
out of your life.

1046
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:03,134
You, brother ken, has got to
keep Satan out of your life.

1047
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,370
The only way Satan can
get in is you ask him in.

1048
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:06,705
Satan will come to your door.

1049
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:08,674
He will knock upon your door.

1050
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:09,608
He said, Ken, can I come in?

1051
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:10,676
You say, no!

1052
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:12,944
Satan, stay away from me!

1053
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:14,580
You say get thee behind
me old master of evil.

1054
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,616
Ge thee behind me
old master of evil.

1055
00:40:17,716 --> 00:40:21,453
Do not, do not, do not
let Satan into your life!

1056
00:40:21,553 --> 00:40:23,555
Can you hear me brother, Ken?

1057
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:26,692
Excuse me, um, we're not
interrupting anything here,

1058
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:27,993
Are we?
Oh, no.

1059
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:28,994
You're not interrupting.

1060
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:30,428
I'm just putting
brother Ken back

1061
00:40:30,529 --> 00:40:31,663
On the correct spiritual path.

1062
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:32,464
Yeah.

1063
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:37,736
Preacher man Bob,
Annie and I were

1064
00:40:37,836 --> 00:40:39,004
Wondering if you'd marry us.

1065
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:39,805
Marry ya?

1066
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:41,139
Marry you two?

1067
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:43,642
Why nothing would fill
my heart with more joy.

1068
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:45,544
How better to get over
the lost of a loved

1069
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:48,013
One than for two people
who love each other so

1070
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:51,116
To be united in holy matrimony.

1071
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:52,217
Cool.

1072
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:53,752
God.

1073
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:55,521
God, will you
sanction this event?

1074
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:59,157
Will you bless this holy wedding
that I am about to perform?

1075
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:00,225
Amen.

1076
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:01,026
Say it brother, Ken

1077
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:01,860
Amen!

1078
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,861
Say it loud and say it proud!

1079
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:03,662
Amen!

1080
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:10,602
Brian, you take this
woman, this woman Annie,

00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:13,605
To be your wife, to love her,
to cherish her forever, forever,

1082
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:15,106
And ever?

1083
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,307
I do.

1084
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:19,310
And Annie, do you take
this man, this man Brian,

1085
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:23,815
To be your man forever,
forever, till death do you part?

1086
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:24,950
I do.

1087
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:28,286
By the power vested in
me by the God almighty,

1088
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:31,089
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1089
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:31,890
Amen.

1090
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:39,430
Well hey, let's celebrate.

1091
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:40,231
Alrighty.

1092
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:50,709
To the happy couple.

1093
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:52,143
Here, here.

1094
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,479
Cheers.

1095
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,947

Jumping for Jesus!

1104
00:42:48,867 --> 00:42:49,768
Yeah, baby!

Jumping for Jesus!

1109
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:56,675
Yes!

1110
00:42:56,775 --> 00:42:57,475
Woo!

1111
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:01,146
Excuse me.

1112
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:02,648
I have to pee.

[Toilet flushing]

1114
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:24,903
God, you scared me.

1115
00:43:25,003 --> 00:43:26,872
Sorry, I have to pee, too.

1116
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:33,311
I love you, Brian.

1117
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:34,813
I love you to, Annie.

1118
00:43:34,913 --> 00:43:37,348
What do you say we
make this party short

1119
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,383
So we can have our honeymoon?

1120
00:43:38,483 --> 00:43:39,450
Oh, yeah.

1121
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,251
Good.

1122
00:44:00,038 --> 00:44:01,106

Get thee behind
me master of evil.

1126
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:09,214
What?

1127
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:10,248
Uh, nothing.

1128
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:11,616
What's going on?

1129
00:44:11,717 --> 00:44:14,452
I feel kind of weird like I
missed something or something.

1130
00:44:14,552 --> 00:44:16,121
Uh, nothing's happening.

1131
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:19,324
You know, just stuff.

1132
00:44:19,424 --> 00:44:21,760
Wait a... you feel OK, son?

1133
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:22,560
Uh, yeah.

1134
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,030
I feel kind of weird.

1135
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:26,297
Go ahead and keep
dancing there, boy.

1136
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:27,665
It's good for the spirit.

1137
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:28,466
Dance on!

1138
00:44:28,566 --> 00:44:29,400
Come on dance.

1139
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,736
Dance on, um.

1140
00:44:30,836 --> 00:44:32,337
Churn the milk
and make it butter.

1141
00:44:32,437 --> 00:44:34,372
Churn the milk and
make it butter.

Churn the milk and
make it butter.

1143
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:39,510
Churn the milk and
make it butter.

1144
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,346
Is it Satan preacher man Bob?

1145
00:44:41,446 --> 00:44:42,714
Is Wade possessed by Satan?

1146
00:44:42,814 --> 00:44:43,749
I don't know.

1147
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:44,850
I don't think so.

1148
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:46,151
What's going on?

1149
00:44:46,251 --> 00:44:47,118
This can't be happening.

1150
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:48,119
Can it?

1151
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:49,287
Annie, there's a
reason for everything.

1152
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:50,388
And I'm going to
figure this out.

1153
00:44:50,488 --> 00:44:51,389
I promise!

1154
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:52,490
Wow, I wonder.

1155
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:53,458
Wonder what, Brian?

1156
00:44:53,558 --> 00:44:54,625
Do you know something we don't?

1157
00:44:54,726 --> 00:44:55,560
You know?

1158
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:56,828
Now is the time to
talk, young man.

1159
00:44:56,928 --> 00:44:58,696
I didn't take her
seriously at the time.

1160
00:44:58,797 --> 00:45:00,131
I never believe in
that witchcraft stuff.

1161
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:02,633
Didn't take who
seriously at what time?

1162
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:03,601
What are you talking about?

1163
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,402
At the funeral.

1164
00:45:04,502 --> 00:45:05,503
Wade's sister.

1165
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:07,438
She told me some mambo
jumbo about a curse.

1166
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,809
She said if anybody said the
word buttcrack in one breath,

1167
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:13,078
Wade would the chance to come
back and stand up for himself.

1168
00:45:13,178 --> 00:45:15,180
Buttcrack 12 times
in one breath?

1169
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:15,981
Oh, God!

1170
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:18,349
Me and my stupid big mouth.

1171
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:21,853
What do you mean he'd have a
chance to stand up for himself?

1172
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:23,021
Um.

1173
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:25,456
So he really is possessed
by Satan, isn't he?

1174
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,925
No, Ken.

1175
00:45:27,025 --> 00:45:28,193
Wade is the victim here.

1176
00:45:28,293 --> 00:45:31,362
He's been robbed of his
chance for natural afterlife.

1177
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:33,598
There's some kind of
dark magic going on here.

1178
00:45:33,698 --> 00:45:35,366
Something evil is at work.

1179
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:36,734
Something is wrong.

1180
00:45:36,835 --> 00:45:38,837
Wade's not the source of it.

1181
00:45:38,937 --> 00:45:39,771
Oh, yeah.

1182
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:41,606
Wade was a true friend to you.

1183
00:45:41,706 --> 00:45:43,474
And you're going to help him
back to his resting place.

1184
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,744
You're going to help him regain
his dignity down in the ground.

1185
00:45:46,845 --> 00:45:48,279
This darkness that
has befallen him,

1186
00:45:48,379 --> 00:45:49,647
You must help him overcome.

1187
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:50,816
Well I mean, how do we do that?

1188
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:52,083
Look at him.
He's alive.

1189
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:53,184
He's not alive!

1190
00:45:53,284 --> 00:45:54,319
That's not alive!

1191
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:57,188
He's being made a
mockery of by his sister!

1192
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:59,090
Some kind of evil
at work here, I say.

1193
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,758
Evil, dark magic!

1194
00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:04,062
What we got to do is help
him get back into that earth!

1195
00:46:04,162 --> 00:46:05,964
That's what we gotta
do, brothers and sister.

1196
00:46:06,064 --> 00:46:06,764
You mean hell.

1197
00:46:06,865 --> 00:46:08,233
No Ken, not hell.

1198
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:09,868
Wade is the victim here.

1199
00:46:09,968 --> 00:46:11,236
He was a faithful
member of my church

1200
00:46:11,336 --> 00:46:13,538
For many, many, many years.

1201
00:46:13,638 --> 00:46:15,573
He's being deprived of
his spiritual rights.

1202
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:18,910
Someone is denying him of
what he belongs to be doing.

1203
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:21,346
What we need to
do is help return

1204
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:22,447
To the proper resting place!

1205
00:46:22,547 --> 00:46:23,982
Do you understand?

1206
00:46:24,082 --> 00:46:26,384
Oh, yeah.

1207
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:28,186
OK, I guess we should make
doubly sure that he's dead

1208
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:29,855
And take him back to his grave.
That's right.

1209
00:46:29,955 --> 00:46:30,721
Let's go it him!

1210
00:46:38,396 --> 00:46:39,097
Ow!

1211
00:46:39,197 --> 00:46:40,331
What are you doing?
Huh?

1212
00:46:40,431 --> 00:46:41,833
What did you do that for, Brian?
He's already dead.

1213
00:46:41,933 --> 00:46:42,667
You can't hurt him!

1214
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:44,735
Whack him good!

1215
00:46:44,836 --> 00:46:45,670
Give it to him!

1216

Hit him!

Hit him!

I sure hope we did
the right thing.

1223
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:00,952
Trust me, Brian.

1224
00:47:01,052 --> 00:47:03,354
If it was you, you'd want
us to do the same thing.

1225
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:04,990
Aw, man.

1226
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:06,257
You got to kill the evil beast!

1227
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:07,425
Come on!
Whack him!

1228

Whack a doo!

00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,827
Whack a doo!

1230
00:47:09,928 --> 00:47:10,628
Get him!

1231
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:14,265
Let me see.

1232
00:47:14,365 --> 00:47:16,067
I think we got him here.

1233
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,903
Now what?

1234
00:47:18,003 --> 00:47:19,905
Let's take him back
to his resting place.

He's alive again.

1240
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,955
Ah!

[Music playing]

1242
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:36,814
Well I know I already
said everything

1243
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,117
I could possibly say at the
first funeral for brother Wade.

1244
00:48:39,217 --> 00:48:42,353
But I feel that anytime a
young man is to be buried,

1245
00:48:42,453 --> 00:48:46,091
Words should be
said over his body.

1246
00:48:46,191 --> 00:48:47,425
Whoa, hey, hey, hey, now.
Whoa.

1247
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:48,226
Oh, shit.

1248
00:49:03,108 --> 00:49:06,044
God, this is not
the first time we've

1249

Laid poor brother Wade to rest.

gonna be the last.

Please don't blame brother
Wade for the actions

1252

Of his evil sister.

1253

And please, God, except
the wretched soul

1254
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:20,992
Back into your Heavenly kingdom.

00:49:28,266 --> 00:49:29,534
Amen!

1263
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:32,337
Please God, amen this man and
keep him down in the ground.

1264
00:49:32,437 --> 00:49:33,104
Thank you.

1265
00:49:33,204 --> 00:49:34,072
Amen.

1266
00:49:34,172 --> 00:49:35,840
Amen.

1267
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:36,641
There.

1268
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:48,553
Fools.

1269
00:49:57,528 --> 00:49:58,229
Uh.

1270
00:49:58,329 --> 00:49:59,664
What's going on?

1271
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,135
Don't let them get
away with it, Wade.

1272
00:50:04,235 --> 00:50:05,303
What do you mean?

1273
00:50:05,403 --> 00:50:07,938
I was, I was, I was
going towards this light.

1274
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:08,939
It was this beautiful light.

1275
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,241
And I knew that when
I got there that...

1276
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:11,776
I know, I know but
he tried to kill you.

1277
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:13,244
He threw the radio
in the tub with you.

1278
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:14,045
No.

1279
00:50:14,145 --> 00:50:14,845
No!

1280
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,416
Ow!

1281
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:19,817
If you weren't already dead,
that would've killed you.

1282
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:22,253
You've got to get your revenge.

1283
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:23,588
You've got to do
something if you

1284
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:24,989
Want to go back to the light.

1285
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:26,023
What?

1286
00:50:26,124 --> 00:50:27,592
You have to kill him, Wade.

1287
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:28,893
Oh.

1288
00:50:28,993 --> 00:50:30,295
If you don't, you're doomed
to walk the earth forever.

1289
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:31,662
You'll never get
back to the light.

1290
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:33,231
Why did you do this to me?

1291
00:50:33,331 --> 00:50:34,632
Why couldn't you
just leave me alone?

1292
00:50:34,732 --> 00:50:35,800
Others will try
to kill him, too.

1293
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,136
You have got to be the
one to kill him, Wade.

1294
00:50:38,236 --> 00:50:39,437
Why couldn't you
just leave me alone?

1295
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:42,373
A spell this powerful comes
with certain side effects.

1296
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:44,209
Well I've never killed anybody.

1297
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:45,009
Do what you must.

1298
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:45,843
Strangle him.

1299
00:50:45,943 --> 00:50:46,644
Electrocute him.

1300
00:50:46,744 --> 00:50:47,678
Shoot him.

1301
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:48,713
I don't even have a gun.

1302
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:55,386
What are you going to do?

1303
00:50:55,486 --> 00:50:57,088
I guess I'll get my revenge.

1304
00:50:57,188 --> 00:50:59,124
Good.

1305
00:50:59,224 --> 00:51:00,525
I'm only doing this
because I want to get

1306
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:02,293
Back to where it's peaceful.

1307
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:05,430
I'm not really mad
at Brian or anything.

1308
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:06,797
Wade?

1309
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:07,698
Huh?

1310
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:08,566
Pull your pants up.

1311
00:51:44,068 --> 00:51:46,337
Well preacher man Bob,
thanks for marrying us.

1312
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,072
And thanks for your
help with Wade.

1313
00:51:48,173 --> 00:51:49,039
No problem at all, son.

1314
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,608
I'm just glad I can help.

1315
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:52,810
So you're sure
Wade won't be back.

1316
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:56,414
I mean, you don't think so.

1317
00:51:56,514 --> 00:52:00,084
Little lady, I'm 98% sure
you'll be seeing no more Wade.

1318
00:52:00,185 --> 00:52:01,986
Well what if he does come back?

1319
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:05,022
Are there any special
prayers we should say?

1320
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,425
You know, the bible doesn't
cover zombie resurrections.

1321
00:52:07,525 --> 00:52:09,627
I wish it did, but it doesn't.

1322
00:52:09,727 --> 00:52:10,961
What you should do.

1323
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,331
What you should do is just
chop his arms and his legs off.

1324
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:14,965
I mean, just hack him up.

1325
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:17,768
That way, he won't be able to go
anywhere if he does come back.

1326
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:19,470
And let me tell
you one more thing.

1327
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:20,271
He's already dead.

1328
00:52:20,371 --> 00:52:21,105
You can't hurt him.

1329
00:52:21,206 --> 00:52:21,906
He's dead.

1330
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:22,940
You can't hurt him.

1331
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,942
Just make sure he
stays in the ground.

1332
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:25,876
OK.

1333
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,412
Should we burn
all of his stuff?

1334
00:52:27,512 --> 00:52:29,347
Would that rid the
house of all evil?

1335
00:52:29,447 --> 00:52:32,683
Brother Ken, I'm getting sick
and tired of explaining to you

1336
00:52:32,783 --> 00:52:33,951
That Wade's not the problem.

1337
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:34,919
He's not evil.

1338
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:35,720
It's his sister.

1339
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,987
Holy!

1340
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:38,122
Oh, yeah.

1341
00:52:38,223 --> 00:52:41,626
But shouldn't we burn
all of his stuff anyway?

1342
00:52:41,726 --> 00:52:43,261
Brother Ken, me
and you are going

1343
00:52:43,361 --> 00:52:45,296
To have to have a special
spiritual counseling session.

1344
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:47,365
You come down by the church
about 1 o'clock tomorrow.

1345
00:52:47,465 --> 00:52:48,366
You hear me, son?

1346
00:52:48,466 --> 00:52:49,534
And we'll have a
little talk then.

1347
00:52:49,634 --> 00:52:50,335
OK.

1348
00:53:07,952 --> 00:53:10,020
So I guess you want
to be alone, huh?

1349
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,389
Well, yeah.

1350
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:12,590
I understand.

1351
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:13,824
Mind if I use your
bathroom first?

1352
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:15,793
I got to piss like a racehorse.

1353
00:53:15,893 --> 00:53:16,761
No, go right ahead.

1354
00:53:26,637 --> 00:53:28,773
You don't think Wade
will be back, do you?

1355
00:53:28,873 --> 00:53:30,174
I don't know really.

1356
00:53:30,275 --> 00:53:32,643
I don't know how powerful that
spell Wade's sister put on him.

1357
00:53:32,743 --> 00:53:34,945
She blames me for Wade's death.

1358
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,014
You didn't have anything
to do with Wade's death.

1359
00:53:37,114 --> 00:53:38,082
Everybody knows that.

1360
00:53:38,182 --> 00:53:39,350
Even the police know that.

1361
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:40,618
I know.

1362
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:41,952
She just thinks she knows
something the rest of you,

1363
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,655
The rest of us, don't.

1364
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:47,392
Well I guess that's
all behind us now.

1365
00:53:47,492 --> 00:53:48,693
We're together.

1366
00:53:48,793 --> 00:53:51,362
And no one will ever come
between us again the way he

1367
00:53:51,462 --> 00:53:53,864
Did with his buttcrack and all.

1368
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:57,402
Yeah, once Ken leaves, we can
get this marriage underway.

1369
00:53:57,502 --> 00:54:00,705
Brian, um, there's
something I have to do first.

1370
00:54:00,805 --> 00:54:02,239
My mom's going to be so excited.

1371
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,141
I can't believe I
haven't called her yet.

1372
00:54:18,222 --> 00:54:19,324
Hello, mom?

1373
00:54:19,424 --> 00:54:20,124
Hi, it's me.

1374
00:54:20,224 --> 00:54:21,926
Guess what.

1375
00:54:22,026 --> 00:54:23,828
Yeah!

1376
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:27,064
Guess what else.

1377
00:54:27,164 --> 00:54:29,500
Well we, kind of, eloped.

1378
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,603
Preacher man Bob was here,
and he did the ceremony.

1379
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,872
And it was really nice.

1380
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:37,742
I hope you're not mad at me.

1381
00:54:37,842 --> 00:54:38,709
Good.

1382
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:40,845
Oh, I will.

1383
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:41,646
OK.

1384
00:54:44,582 --> 00:54:46,351
I love you too, mom.

1385
00:54:46,451 --> 00:54:47,352
I'll see you at Thanksgiving.

1386
00:54:47,452 --> 00:54:49,086
OK?

1387
00:54:49,186 --> 00:54:51,822
Bye, mom.

1388
00:54:51,922 --> 00:54:53,157
[Inaudible] baby.

1389
00:54:53,257 --> 00:54:55,125
[Screaming]

1390
00:54:59,897 --> 00:55:01,532
So where are you and Annie
going on your honeymoon?

1391
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:02,333
[Inaudible].

1392
00:55:07,071 --> 00:55:07,972
Annie!

1393
00:55:08,072 --> 00:55:09,940
[Music playing]

1394
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:27,725
Get away, buttcrack boy.

1395
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:41,372
[Screaming]

1396
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:53,884
Brian, whatever you do,
don't look at his buttcrack.

1397
00:56:15,906 --> 00:56:19,109
You're out of your
mind, butt boy!

1398
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,545
[Screaming]

1399
00:56:30,455 --> 00:56:32,322
Get out of my way [inaudible]!

1400
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,104
Ah!

1401
00:56:47,204 --> 00:56:48,105
Ah!

1402
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:49,073
Oh, grandma!

1403
00:56:49,173 --> 00:56:50,274
Get the biscuits ready!

1404
00:56:50,374 --> 00:56:51,075
I'm coming!

1405
00:57:04,522 --> 00:57:05,690
Preacher man Bob.

1406
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:07,925
I just came back
to get my bible.

1407
00:57:08,025 --> 00:57:09,460
I left it in your living.

1408
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,128
Nice shooting.

1409
00:57:11,228 --> 00:57:12,262
If I can't defend
myself, I can't

1410
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:14,431
Do the Lord's work, young man.

1411
00:57:14,532 --> 00:57:15,332
What happened?

1412
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,802
Annie.

1413
00:57:17,902 --> 00:57:21,205
Wade's sister is
interfering in areas where

1414
00:57:21,305 --> 00:57:22,773
She does not belong at all!

1415
00:57:22,873 --> 00:57:23,574
Annie.

1416
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:30,014
Son, it's time for you to lay
down and take that big rest.

1417
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:37,788
Oh, God, except this young man
into your heavenly kingdom!

1418
00:57:37,888 --> 00:57:38,589
No, please, no!

1419
00:57:38,689 --> 00:57:40,357
Brian, no!

1420
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,192
You can't be dead!

1421
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,327
Brian, no!

1422
00:57:43,427 --> 00:57:44,929
Wade, brother
Wade, Brian's gone.

1423
00:57:45,029 --> 00:57:45,730
He's gone.

1424
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:47,064
You can't bring him back.

1425
00:57:47,164 --> 00:57:48,265
No!

1426
00:57:48,365 --> 00:57:49,834
I know it's hard to except
the loss of a friend.

1427
00:57:49,934 --> 00:57:51,702
But Brian is gone, Wade.

1428
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:52,903
Brian, no!

1429
00:57:53,003 --> 00:57:53,704
No!

1430
00:57:58,709 --> 00:58:01,278
Wade, what's happening?

1431
00:58:01,378 --> 00:58:04,782
I was heading
towards this light.

1432
00:58:04,882 --> 00:58:06,684
Brian, you're not dead!

1433
00:58:06,784 --> 00:58:07,484
Brian?

1434
00:58:21,465 --> 00:58:22,833
Meet your maker, boy!

1435
00:58:38,549 --> 00:59:19,056
[Chanting] So long, Wade.

1436
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:52,757
Lady, you done really
made a mess of things.

1437
00:59:52,857 --> 00:59:55,225
You done really screwed
a lot of people up.

1438
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:56,526

Hey, dad.

1444
01:01:03,027 --> 01:01:05,295
I found it.

1445
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:06,797

You know, the buttcrack guy.

1460
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:52,676
Well why do you need a
picture of this guy's grave?

He's part of the local history.

That's right.

that after his funeral,

01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,722
His roommate was
found dead, too.

1467

tar out of him.

to be in my book.

on that silly book, are you?

be more than cool,

Especially when I go into all
the rumors about this guy.

1493
01:03:06,817 --> 01:03:09,854

papers didn't even talk.

1494

Oh, yeah, definitely.

Well that's what
folks are saying.

back to life to get revenge

1502
01:03:24,668 --> 01:03:26,971
Because somebody said
the word buttcrack 12

Times in one breath.

1504
01:03:28,338 --> 01:03:29,373
There was a curse on him.

1505

And that's why everybody's
face was melted.

1506

He came back to life, they
looked at his buttcrack,

1507
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,281
And then they died.

unknown assailant.

remained a mystery.

of the sisters grave, too.

the book, you know,

one who put the curse on him.
