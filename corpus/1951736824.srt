1
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,517
<i>He was growing into middle age...</i>

2
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,216
<i>...and was living then in a bungalow
on Woodland Avenue.</i>

3
00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:20,323
<i>He installed himself in a rocking chair...</i>

4
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,556
<i>...and smoked a cigar down
in the evenings...</i>

5
00:01:22,732 --> 00:01:25,633
<i>...as his wife wiped her pink hands
on an apron...</i>

6
00:01:25,802 --> 00:01:28,999
<i>...and reported happily
on their two children.</i>

7
00:01:34,944 --> 00:01:36,502
<i>His children knew his legs...</i>

8
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:40,010
<i>...the sting of his mustache
against their cheeks.</i>

9
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:46,015
<i>They didn't know how their father made
his living or why they so often moved.</i>

10
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,657
<i>They didn't even know
their father's name.</i>

11
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:55,829
<i>He was listed in the city directory
as Thomas Howard.</i>

12
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:58,431
<i>And he went everywhere unrecognized...</i>

13
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:01,661
<i>...and lunched with Kansas City
shopkeepers and merchants...</i>

14
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,197
<i>...calling himself a cattleman
or a commodities investor...</i>

15
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:09,670
<i>...someone rich and leisured
who had the common touch.</i>

16
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:16,218
<i>He had two incompletely healed
bullet holes in his chest...</i>

17
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,944
<i>...and another in his thigh.</i>

18
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:20,646
<i>He was missing the nub
of his left middle finger...</i>

19
00:02:20,824 --> 00:02:24,055
<i>...and was cautious,
lest that mutilation be seen.</i>

20
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:29,560
<i>He also had a condition that was
referred to as "granulated eyelids"...</i>

21
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,724
<i>...and it caused him
to blink more than usual...</i>

22
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:37,633
<i>...as if he found creation
slightly more than he could accept.</i>

23
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,836
<i>Rooms seemed hotter
when he was in them.</i>

24
00:02:42,312 --> 00:02:44,041
<i>Rains fell straighter.</i>

25
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:45,978
<i>Clocks slowed.</i>

26
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:48,913
<i>Sounds were amplified.</i>

27
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:52,817
<i>He considered himself
a Southern loyalist and guerrilla...</i>

28
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:55,958
<i>...in a Civil War that never ended.</i>

29
00:02:56,125 --> 00:03:01,495
<i>He regretted neither his robberies,
nor the 17 murders that he laid claim to.</i>

30
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:12,235
<i>He had seen another summer under
in Kansas City, Missouri...</i>

31
00:03:12,408 --> 00:03:16,708
<i>...and on September 5th
in the year 1881...</i>

32
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:20,509
<i>...he was 34 years old.</i>

33
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:31,225
You just... You just slide them things
right in there, right in your sleeve...

34
00:03:31,394 --> 00:03:34,420
...and then, when you get ready,
you just shake it out.

35
00:03:34,597 --> 00:03:36,929
Like that, right there. You shake it out.

36
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:44,466
Mary Todd Lincoln, tyrant's wife, fall
into hysterics when the moon was full.

37
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,201
President's men would tie her up
with hay-baling wire...

38
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:49,572
...keep her from ripping
her husband's ears off.

39
00:03:49,746 --> 00:03:54,240
You never heard word one about the wife of
the Confederacy's Jefferson Davis, did you?

40
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:55,714
- I didn't.
- No, you didn't.

41
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,818
He did his duty by her.

42
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:03,715
- Oh, my God, I'm speaking to children.
- No, I get it, I get it, I get it.

43
00:04:03,893 --> 00:04:08,091
The president of the Confederacy discerned
his wife's needs and satisfied them...

44
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:12,892
...with the utmost skill
and the utmost courtesy.

45
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:18,162
- Charley, you spit all over my boot.
- Sorry. Sorry, sorry, Jesse.

46
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:21,299
- Here, get it off.
- I'll wipe it... I'll wipe it off.

47
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:25,840
But Abraham Lincoln probably sent his wife
on a shopping expedition.

48
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:29,781
- A three-act play.
- With money stole from us.

49
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,787
Chow!

50
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:38,617
I think insanity run on both sides
of that Lincoln family.

51
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:40,695
You're right about that.

52
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,457
The river... You jump in the river.

53
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:48,995
- Chow!
- Don't be shy now, Dick.

54
00:04:49,272 --> 00:04:51,604
- One more piece of meat.
- When you diddle a lot...

55
00:04:51,774 --> 00:04:54,265
There's a good piece of bacon fat
in there for him.

56
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:31,237
Excuse me.

57
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:35,376
I see I've traipsed right on in
and interrupted you.

58
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,415
Who are you, then?

59
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:41,921
Bob Ford.

60
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:44,554
Charley's brother?

61
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:47,428
Yeah.

62
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:04,774
I was lying when I said
I just happened down here.

63
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:09,213
I've been looking for you. I feel lousy
I didn't say so at the outset.

64
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,380
Folks take me for a nincompoop...

65
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:17,287
...on account of the shabby first impression
I make, whereas I think of myself...

66
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,894
...as being just a rung down
from the James brothers.

67
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,732
I was hoping if I ran into you
aside from those peckerwoods...

68
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,961
...I could show you how special I am.

69
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:43,408
I honestly believe I'm destined
for great things, Mr. James.

70
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:47,920
I got qualities that don't come shining
through right at the outset.

71
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:53,756
You give me a chance, I'll get
the job done. I guarantee you that.

72
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,265
Hey, Dick, is it true you diddled a squaw?

73
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:07,738
Come on, you can tell me. I've always
wanted to lay down with a redskin.

74
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:09,744
Well, Charley...

75
00:07:11,214 --> 00:07:14,650
...there's a feeling that comes over you...

76
00:07:14,817 --> 00:07:18,480
...getting inside a woman whose hands
has scalped a congregation.

77
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:21,487
There's this thunderous sound
that comes from their cooch...

78
00:07:21,657 --> 00:07:24,922
...on account of the fact that
they birth a child standing upright...

79
00:07:25,094 --> 00:07:28,086
...like a wild animal.
- What's it sound like?

80
00:07:28,264 --> 00:07:32,530
Whatever a thunderous cooch sounds like
there, Charley. I don't know.

81
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:34,535
No.

82
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,104
They got a noisy quim
on account of the fact that...

83
00:07:37,273 --> 00:07:42,176
...they use their cunnis as a saddlebag
to carry sundries across the plains.

84
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,242
Come on, what'd it really feel like?
Did it feel good?

85
00:07:46,415 --> 00:07:48,815
Come on, fess up, now.

86
00:07:48,985 --> 00:07:50,885
I like you, Charley.

87
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:54,483
I like you too, Charley.

88
00:07:54,924 --> 00:07:55,948
Well...

89
00:07:57,994 --> 00:07:59,985
You're not so special, Mr. Ford.

90
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:04,865
You're just like any other tyro
who's prinked himself up for an escapade.

91
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:08,868
Hoping to be a gunslinger
like them nickel books are about.

92
00:08:09,872 --> 00:08:12,739
You may as well quench your mind of it...

93
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:17,002
...because you don't have
the ingredients, son.

94
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:34,560
Well, I'm sorry to hear
you feel that way...

95
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,927
...as I put such stock
in your opinions.

96
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:47,201
As for me being a gunslinger, I've just got
this one granddaddy Paterson Colt...

97
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:49,844
...and a borrowed belt to stick it in.

98
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:53,345
But I also got an appetite
for greater things.

99
00:08:56,586 --> 00:09:00,613
I hoped by joining up with you, it'd put me
that much closer to getting them.

100
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:06,187
Well, what am I supposed to say to that?

101
00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:10,259
Let me be your sidekick tonight.

102
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:11,559
Sidekick?

103
00:09:11,734 --> 00:09:13,861
So you can examine my grit
and intelligence.

104
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:15,731
I don't know what it is about you...

105
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:18,965
...but the more you talk,
the more you give me the willies.

106
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:23,037
Now, I don't believe I want you anywhere
within earshot this evening, okay?

107
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:24,702
You understand?

108
00:09:28,884 --> 00:09:32,251
- Well, I'm sorry...
- Why don't you just get now? Scat.

109
00:09:38,427 --> 00:09:39,519
All right.

110
00:09:42,265 --> 00:09:45,826
I was with a girl once, wasn't a squaw.

111
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,867
But she was pretty.

112
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:52,606
She had yellow hair like a...

113
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,175
Oh, like something.

114
00:09:56,445 --> 00:09:59,312
Like hair bobbed from a ray of sunlight?

115
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:02,417
Yeah. Yeah, like that.

116
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:05,781
Boy, you... You talk good.

117
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:08,617
You can hide things in vocabulary.

118
00:10:10,593 --> 00:10:15,155
Maybe you and me could write her a note,
send it by post?

119
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:17,026
See, all you gotta do, Ed...

120
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,498
...is predict her needs
and beat her to the punch.

121
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:26,437
Well, this girl, she has a real specific job.

122
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,534
- Specific?
- We was only together once.

123
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:30,974
She...

124
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:36,209
She was afraid of lightning,
and she came up under the wagon and...

125
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:39,320
...just cuddled right up to me.

126
00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:41,456
She give me a kind price too.

127
00:10:43,492 --> 00:10:47,519
Well, I'll be. That is specific.

128
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,530
Yeah, sure,
she'd been with other people...

129
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:54,761
...but the kind of things she said to me...

130
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:58,065
...people just don't say
unless they really mean it.

131
00:10:59,008 --> 00:11:01,306
<i>My love said she would marry only me</i>

132
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:05,204
<i>And Jove himself could not make her care.</i>

133
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:07,975
<i>For what women say to lovers, you'll agree</i>

134
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:12,246
<i>One writes on running water or on air.</i>

135
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:17,318
My God, that's good.
Let's write her that.

136
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:19,954
No.

137
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,662
Poetry don't work on whores.

138
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,826
How do you do?

139
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:32,332
Am I too late
to wish you a happy birthday?

140
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,172
How'd you know?

141
00:11:36,746 --> 00:11:39,010
You'd be surprised
at what I got stored away.

142
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:41,775
I'm an authority on the James boys.

143
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,418
Is you?

144
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:49,649
Well... Well, your brother Frank and I,
we just had a real nice visit.

145
00:11:49,825 --> 00:11:53,989
Just chit-chatting about this and that,
right over there.

146
00:11:54,397 --> 00:11:57,298
And must've been a hundred subjects
entertained...

147
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,832
Good Lord, you know
what this stew needs?

148
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:06,134
Dumplings?

149
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,071
Noodles.

150
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:11,811
You eat yourself some noodle stew
and your clock'll tick all night.

151
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,849
You ever see that woman up in Fayette?
Suck noodles up her nose.

152
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,415
- In Fayette?
- I don't believe I have.

153
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:21,920
You never heard of her, huh?

154
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:25,421
You got canals up there
you never dreamed of.

155
00:12:29,598 --> 00:12:31,293
I don't like to harp on a subject...

156
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:34,061
I don't care who comes with me.
Never have.

157
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:36,830
That's why they call me gregarious.

158
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:41,472
I hear you and young Stovepipe here
had a real nice visit.

159
00:12:41,944 --> 00:12:45,971
Your boys have got about a acre
of lumber to haul, dingus.

160
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,646
You better goose them down yonder.

161
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:03,093
<i>The James Gang committed over 25 bank,
train and stagecoach robberies...</i>

162
00:13:03,265 --> 00:13:06,701
<i>...from 1867 to 1881.</i>

163
00:13:07,603 --> 00:13:09,662
<i>But except for Frank and Jesse James...</i>

164
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,969
<i>...all the original members
were now either dead or in prison.</i>

165
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:18,974
<i>- mine eye
All my soul and all my every part</i>

166
00:13:19,849 --> 00:13:22,647
<i>And for this sin, there is no remedy</i>

167
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,149
<i>It is so grounded inward in my heart.</i>

168
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:28,620
<i>So for their last robbery at Blue Cut...</i>

169
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:32,386
<i>...the brothers recruited a gang
of petty thieves and country rubes...</i>

170
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,223
<i>...culled from the local hillsides.</i>

171
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,270
Right on schedule, Buck!

172
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:58,004
Snuff those lanterns!

173
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,980
Look at those fools. They're gonna trip
and shoot each other into females.

174
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,279
I bet you I could find them husbands
if they do.

175
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:51,883
Fan out!

176
00:16:55,397 --> 00:16:57,331
Hold your fire!

177
00:17:00,302 --> 00:17:01,530
- Watch him!
- Going down.

178
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,275
Hold your fire, you idiots!

179
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,513
Hold your fire!

180
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,361
Let me in.

181
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:34,933
Buck! Boys!

182
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:37,163
Buck, this way!

183
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,474
Do you think that lock will hold?

184
00:17:42,044 --> 00:17:43,705
No, I don't.

185
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,138
Let's go, let's go.

186
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,761
Let's not get clever, nor courageous,
any of you.

187
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,340
Hey there, boys!
These are all for me?

188
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,616
Looks like Christmas morning in here.

189
00:18:24,453 --> 00:18:26,045
Hey, friend.

190
00:18:27,556 --> 00:18:29,547
You mind if I have a peek around?

191
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,188
This shit. Nope.

192
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:35,293
Nope.

193
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:38,296
You got anything good here?

194
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:40,601
It could be.

195
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,318
Open that safe.

196
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:04,216
Do it!

197
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,823
- You didn't have to bop him.
- Yeah, he did. They needed convincing.

198
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:13,433
They got their company rules,
I got my mean streak...

199
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:16,093
...and that's how
we get things done around here.

200
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:20,903
- Get on over here and attend to this thing.
- Come on, go.

201
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:27,914
Hold your fire, you idiots!

202
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,181
Dig deeper.

203
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,083
- Come on!
- Give me your money.

204
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,192
- And you, stand up.
- Let's see your hands.

205
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,089
What have you got?

206
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,594
Speak English.

207
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,301
Money. Money. You understand that?

208
00:19:49,872 --> 00:19:51,339
Give me your money!

209
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,716
There's some receipts.

210
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:06,319
I got fives.

211
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:10,324
Jesse. Jesse.

212
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,626
Don't look good.

213
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:24,235
There ain't no 100,000 dollars
in here, Dick.

214
00:20:33,115 --> 00:20:34,673
Get down on your knees.

215
00:20:35,884 --> 00:20:37,408
Why?

216
00:20:37,586 --> 00:20:39,144
Well, you ought to pray.

217
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,513
I'm gonna kill you.

218
00:20:48,196 --> 00:20:49,959
Get at!

219
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:54,599
You're gonna have to make me.

220
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,500
All right.

221
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:29,197
Don't shoot him! No, don't shoot him.

222
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:44,113
Don't tell me what I can
and cannot do, Ed.

223
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,924
Round them up!

224
00:22:13,015 --> 00:22:16,815
<i>Chicago newspaper publishers made
a great deal of the Blue Cut train robbery...</i>

225
00:22:16,985 --> 00:22:18,976
<i>...alleging that in no state
but Missouri...</i>

226
00:22:19,154 --> 00:22:22,646
<i>...would the James brothers be tolerated
for 12 years.</i>

227
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,657
Hey.

228
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,426
Can you keep a secret?

229
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:32,192
It depends on what you're concealing.

230
00:22:33,535 --> 00:22:35,696
You afraid of the dark?

231
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:38,095
No.

232
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,667
You superstitious?

233
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:48,074
I put... I put an acorn in the window
to keep the lightning out.

234
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:41,229
Kid, you must've crept up on cat's paws.

235
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,606
I'll wager that's the first and last time
you'll ever be caught off-guard.

236
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:49,901
How old are you?

237
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,779
Twenty.

238
00:23:55,484 --> 00:23:59,147
Except, well, I guess I won't
really be 20 till...

239
00:23:59,654 --> 00:24:01,815
Till January, so...

240
00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:04,522
I'm 19.

241
00:24:06,928 --> 00:24:10,091
Yeah, you feel older than that, though,
don't you?

242
00:24:14,803 --> 00:24:16,668
Yeah, I do.

243
00:24:29,651 --> 00:24:33,951
Hey, Frank, you...
You think the sheriff's out already?

244
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,720
- More than likely.
- Yeah.

245
00:24:41,663 --> 00:24:43,460
I had a real fine time tonight.

246
00:24:43,632 --> 00:24:46,863
- You think so?
- Yup. Yeah.

247
00:24:47,035 --> 00:24:50,198
Hey, I wasn't just flapping my lips
about my kid brother and me.

248
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:55,134
What I figured was if you and Jesse could
gauge our courage and our daring...

249
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,574
...you might just make us
your regular sidekicks.

250
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,976
Your courage and your daring.

251
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:06,312
I about heard all I want to about sidekicks.
You sound like your damn brother.

252
00:25:06,488 --> 00:25:10,982
Yeah. Well, I'll be square with you,
it's Bob who put me up to it. He's...

253
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,859
He's got plans for the James boys
I can't even get the hang of.

254
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,827
- They're that complicated.
- Yeah?

255
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:20,561
Well, you can just
get shed of that idea.

256
00:25:20,735 --> 00:25:23,260
Because after tonight,
there'll be no more shenanigans.

257
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,772
You can jot that down in your little diary.

258
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:31,709
September 7th, 1881, the James Gang
robbed one last train at Blue Cut...

259
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,371
...and gave up their nightriding for good.

260
00:25:41,022 --> 00:25:42,512
Wait.

261
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,650
Well, how are you gonna
make your living?

262
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,000
Maybe I'll sell shoes.

263
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,905
I can't believe I woke up this morning...

264
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:09,380
...wondering if my daddy
would loan me his overcoat...

265
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:11,416
...and here it is just past midnight...

266
00:26:11,586 --> 00:26:15,147
...I've already robbed a railroad train
and I'm sitting in a rocking chair...

267
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,553
...chatting with none other
than Jesse James.

268
00:26:18,293 --> 00:26:20,921
Yeah, it's a wonderful world.

269
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,168
What's this?

270
00:26:31,373 --> 00:26:33,068
Oh, yeah.

271
00:26:34,242 --> 00:26:38,303
I was real agitated this morning, so I was
wondering if I would know you or Frank...

272
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,611
...tell you all apart, and so I had
this clipping that described you both.

273
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,848
Want me to read it?

274
00:26:46,454 --> 00:26:47,614
Go on.

275
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:51,885
Well... I gotta find it. Hold on.

276
00:26:52,794 --> 00:26:55,024
Here. Here.

277
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:59,326
"Jesse James, the youngest, has a face
as smooth and innocent as a schoolgirl.

278
00:26:59,501 --> 00:27:03,870
The blue eyes, very clear and penetrating,
are never at rest.

279
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,531
His form is tall and graceful
and capable of great endurance...

280
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,142
...and great effort.

281
00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:13,304
Jesse is lighthearted, reckless,
and devil-may-care.

282
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:17,716
- There's always a smile on his lips..."
- All right, all right, all right.

283
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:21,686
Well, yeah, then it just... Frank, Frank,
Frank. That's nothing. And then...

284
00:27:34,135 --> 00:27:36,000
You know what I got
right next to my bed?

285
00:27:36,638 --> 00:27:41,701
<i>Is The Train Robbers, or, A Story
of the James Boys by R.W. Stevens.</i>

286
00:27:41,876 --> 00:27:44,811
I mean, many's the night I stayed up...

287
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,407
...with my eyes open
and my mouth open...

288
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,745
...just reading about your escapades
in the Wide Awake Library.

289
00:27:52,887 --> 00:27:54,582
They're all lies, you know.

290
00:27:57,992 --> 00:27:59,960
Yeah, of course they are.

291
00:28:03,231 --> 00:28:06,428
You don't have to keep smoking that
if it's making you bungey.

292
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:32,692
<i>Alexander Franklin James
would be in Baltimore...</i>

293
00:28:32,861 --> 00:28:36,524
<i>...when he would read of
the assassination of Jesse James.</i>

294
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:54,574
<i>He had spurned his younger brother
for being peculiar and temperamental.</i>

295
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:59,215
<i>But once he perceived
that he would never see Jesse again...</i>

296
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:04,451
<i>...Frank would be wrought-up,
perplexed, despondent.</i>

297
00:29:43,164 --> 00:29:46,429
My brother and me are hardly
on speaking terms these days.

298
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:50,100
Well, I wasn't gonna mention it.

299
00:30:00,648 --> 00:30:02,081
Are you scared?

300
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,011
No, I'm just surprised a little.

301
00:30:05,186 --> 00:30:07,746
They ain't as succulent as I like,
the devil to clean...

302
00:30:07,922 --> 00:30:10,982
...but if a man skins them
and fries them in garlic and oil...

303
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:14,026
...mercy, them's good eating.

304
00:30:14,195 --> 00:30:17,528
Well, I never been that hungry.

305
00:30:20,268 --> 00:30:22,361
I give them names.

306
00:30:23,805 --> 00:30:25,204
Such as?

307
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,400
Such as enemies.

308
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:34,143
I give them names of enemies.

309
00:30:46,895 --> 00:30:49,955
Go tell Wood and Charley
to get their gatherings together.

310
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:52,957
All right.

311
00:30:54,369 --> 00:30:55,927
Me too?

312
00:30:58,072 --> 00:31:00,040
You can stay.

313
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:04,035
All right.

314
00:31:10,652 --> 00:31:11,949
Hey.

315
00:31:14,188 --> 00:31:16,884
- What do you want, peckerwood?
- Nothing.

316
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:19,686
Except to say Jesse wants
you two to gather your parts...

317
00:31:19,861 --> 00:31:22,386
...get on your horses
and get out of town.

318
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:24,688
And me to stick around.

319
00:31:27,035 --> 00:31:30,129
Well, whoa, I'm his cousin...

320
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,034
...I'll have you know.

321
00:31:32,206 --> 00:31:34,367
My mama's his daddy's sister.

322
00:31:34,742 --> 00:31:36,972
Is that how they described it to you,
Wood?

323
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,773
You better watch your tongue,
young sapling.

324
00:31:40,949 --> 00:31:44,316
Why is it me who's gotta rattle his hocks
out of town and not you, Bunny?

325
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,214
Put your horns away.
If I know Jess...

326
00:31:46,387 --> 00:31:49,618
...there's some real nasty
sad-suzie work's gotta be done...

327
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:52,891
...and Bob's the ninny that has to do it.

328
00:31:53,061 --> 00:31:55,325
Oh, yeah, I'm sure that's it, Charley.

329
00:31:57,065 --> 00:32:01,764
You only met him 12 hours ago.
He doesn't even know your name.

330
00:32:02,804 --> 00:32:06,262
Wood! You tell your daddy
I'll be in Kentucky in October.

331
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,041
We can hunt some birds together.

332
00:32:10,578 --> 00:32:12,011
All right.

333
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:16,272
So how come it's Bob who gets to stay?

334
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,845
Bob's gonna move my gear to a house
down the street.

335
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:23,914
See?

336
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:27,217
- I don't mind.
- Yeah, well.

337
00:32:27,395 --> 00:32:29,488
Sounds like an adventure.

338
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:37,199
<i>They moved to 1017 Troost Avenue
at night...</i>

339
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:41,809
<i>...so that the neighborhood couldn't get
a good look at them or their belongings.</i>

340
00:32:43,511 --> 00:32:46,207
<i>Then Bob thought Jesse
would give him eight hours' sleep...</i>

341
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,747
<i>...and a daydreaming goodbye.</i>

342
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,779
<i>But with a second day
in the Thomas Howard house...</i>

343
00:32:54,956 --> 00:32:56,947
<i>...Bob thought he might never go...</i>

344
00:32:57,825 --> 00:33:01,625
<i>...but might be brought in
as a good-natured cousin to the boy...</i>

345
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,828
<i>...and a gentleman helper to Zee.</i>

346
00:33:08,836 --> 00:33:10,599
<i>He went everywhere with Jesse.</i>

347
00:33:10,772 --> 00:33:13,036
<i>They made trips
to the Topeka Exchange Saloon...</i>

348
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:17,007
<i>...where Jesse could spend nearly
60 minutes sipping one glass of beer...</i>

349
00:33:17,178 --> 00:33:20,409
<i>...and still complain about feeling tipsy.</i>

350
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:24,074
<i>Bob would rarely vouchsafe his opinions
as they talked.</i>

351
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,779
<i>If spoken to, he would fidget and grin.</i>

352
00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:32,584
<i>If Jesse palavered with another person,
Bob secretaried their dialogue...</i>

353
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,526
<i>...getting each inflection,
reading every gesture and tic...</i>

354
00:33:36,698 --> 00:33:39,895
<i>...as if he wanted to compose
a biography of the outlaw...</i>

355
00:33:40,068 --> 00:33:43,003
<i>...or as if he were preparing
an impersonation.</i>

356
00:33:58,853 --> 00:34:00,787
Go away.

357
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:07,355
Used to be couldn't no one sneak up
on Jesse James.

358
00:34:08,696 --> 00:34:11,062
Now you think otherwise?

359
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:15,330
I ain't never seen you without your guns,
neither.

360
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:30,915
I can't figure it out.

361
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,980
Do you wanna be like me...

362
00:34:34,422 --> 00:34:35,912
...or do you wanna be me?

363
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:44,093
I'm just making fun, is all.

364
00:34:46,734 --> 00:34:49,999
<i>Bob was sent away cordially
the next day...</i>

365
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,661
<i>...with a goodbye from Jesse...</i>

366
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,775
<i>...but nothing from Zee
beyond what good manners demanded.</i>

367
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,180
<i>It was 40 miles to his sister's farm
from Kansas City.</i>

368
00:35:03,484 --> 00:35:07,784
<i>And it was well into the afternoon
by the time he arrived there.</i>

369
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:12,817
<i>Mrs. Martha Bolton rented
the Harbison farm in 1879...</i>

370
00:35:12,994 --> 00:35:15,554
<i>...just after becoming a widow.</i>

371
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,760
<i>And she made a good income
by giving rooms and meals...</i>

372
00:35:18,933 --> 00:35:24,098
<i>...to her brothers Charley, Wilbur and Bob,
and to members of the James Gang...</i>

373
00:35:24,272 --> 00:35:26,763
<i>...who would appear
whenever they needed seclusion.</i>

374
00:35:26,941 --> 00:35:28,636
Dick! You're gonna make her sick!

375
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:31,779
She's gonna upchuck
if you don't watch out!

376
00:35:32,346 --> 00:35:35,543
<i>Wood Hite had been spurned by Martha
in his affections...</i>

377
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:38,412
<i>...and his attempt to switch his pursuit
to her daughter...</i>

378
00:35:38,586 --> 00:35:40,486
<i>...was being thwarted by Dick Liddil.</i>

379
00:35:40,655 --> 00:35:43,954
Wait a second, you assured me
that you were not ticklish.

380
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:45,149
Howdy!

381
00:35:45,326 --> 00:35:47,157
What's going on, now?
What's going on...?

382
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:50,161
- Howdy!
- Were you fibbing about that?

383
00:35:50,331 --> 00:35:52,128
- No.
- Not at all.

384
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:55,363
You're not supposed to peek, Dick.

385
00:35:55,536 --> 00:35:57,970
Well, you're just so pretty
I can't help myself.

386
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:00,630
- You need to be warning him about that.
- Howdy.

387
00:36:00,808 --> 00:36:04,744
Worry about the field instead,
might be able to worry about the work...

388
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,777
Howdy!

389
00:36:07,548 --> 00:36:10,517
- Finally home.
- I'm so glad, Bob.

390
00:36:10,685 --> 00:36:13,347
I'm in that room too, Bob.
Don't mess with my things.

391
00:36:13,521 --> 00:36:15,546
All right, Grandpa.

392
00:36:21,362 --> 00:36:26,959
"July 9th. Diligence, tact,
and a keen sense of responsibility...

393
00:36:27,134 --> 00:36:31,537
...capacity for detail are your dominant
traits. Your sense of duty's strong."

394
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,477
How long you been there?

395
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,553
Just now arrived. Did I miss much?

396
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:25,726
Not unless you never seen a man
wash his dirty carcass before.

397
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:29,394
Boy, you got a big old pecker
for being such a little squirrel.

398
00:37:29,563 --> 00:37:31,554
That what you come here to see, Dick?

399
00:37:33,467 --> 00:37:34,934
No.

400
00:37:35,903 --> 00:37:39,304
Your brother said that Jesse
kept you in Kansas City some extra days.

401
00:37:39,473 --> 00:37:40,531
What was the reason?

402
00:37:42,743 --> 00:37:46,645
Well, I'm not at liberty to say exactly.

403
00:37:47,048 --> 00:37:52,577
Let me ask you this. Did Jesse mention
that me and Cummins were in cahoots?

404
00:37:53,754 --> 00:37:54,914
Is that so?

405
00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:59,025
Oh, dear. I went on and said too much,
have I?

406
00:37:59,393 --> 00:38:01,452
Well, who else is partners with you two?

407
00:38:03,831 --> 00:38:08,325
See, he'll cut our throats if he finds out.
You don't know him like I do.

408
00:38:08,502 --> 00:38:12,495
You do Jesse dirt,
you connive behind his back...

409
00:38:12,673 --> 00:38:15,471
...boy, he'll come after you
with a cleaver.

410
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:20,670
So, what are you two cahoots
cooking up?

411
00:38:23,684 --> 00:38:25,311
Don't know that I should say.

412
00:38:26,487 --> 00:38:28,580
I'm not gonna wheedle
the dang news from you.

413
00:38:28,756 --> 00:38:30,519
How about we'll leave it a mystery...

414
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:34,989
...and then we won't neither one of us
regret our little chat?

415
00:38:40,701 --> 00:38:43,465
Can you hand me that six-gun there, Bob?

416
00:38:52,546 --> 00:38:56,676
If you so much as mention my name
to Jesse...

417
00:38:56,851 --> 00:38:59,183
...boy, I'll find out about it.

418
00:38:59,353 --> 00:39:02,345
You had better believe that.

419
00:39:02,523 --> 00:39:04,548
And I'll look you up.

420
00:39:04,725 --> 00:39:09,628
I'll knock on your door,
and I will be as mad as a hornet.

421
00:39:10,364 --> 00:39:12,525
I will be hot.

422
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:17,199
You be careful with that iron, Dick.

423
00:39:25,513 --> 00:39:29,108
You know where I stand on these matters
and that's all there is to it.

424
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:32,878
Me and you can be as friendly as pigs
from now on.

425
00:39:58,379 --> 00:40:01,837
I'm Bunny Ford, stick your hands
up in the air!

426
00:40:02,016 --> 00:40:03,711
Mister.

427
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,219
Oh, you have some nerve.

428
00:40:12,526 --> 00:40:17,930
We were just reading about the James boys
among the Mexicans.

429
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:22,329
What's this? This ain't Jesse.

430
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,631
- You don't know that.
- He would've never wore no mustache.

431
00:40:25,806 --> 00:40:28,172
Never was anywheres near a cannon.

432
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,776
Let me see that picture.

433
00:40:30,945 --> 00:40:33,675
Boy, I can't even calculate
what I'm looking at.

434
00:40:33,914 --> 00:40:36,041
- Give me that.
- Ever since he was a child...

435
00:40:36,217 --> 00:40:39,414
...Bob's collected whatsoever he could find
about the James brothers.

436
00:40:39,587 --> 00:40:41,782
Yeah, got himself a little museum
in his room.

437
00:40:41,956 --> 00:40:45,551
Next time you come snooping around,
you better strap on a shooting iron!

438
00:40:46,093 --> 00:40:48,584
Well, you can see how scared I am.

439
00:40:48,762 --> 00:40:52,630
You too, Wood Hite. Cross me again,
I'll put a bullet through your head!

440
00:40:53,634 --> 00:40:54,828
Boy, you...

441
00:40:55,503 --> 00:40:58,165
Son, you better recollect
who my cousin is...

442
00:40:58,339 --> 00:41:02,400
...because you've seemed to misremembered
that Jesse loves me like the Good Book.

443
00:41:02,576 --> 00:41:06,205
Now, you may play it like you're
a dangerous person in the grocery store...

444
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,780
...but don't misremember
who you be accounting to...

445
00:41:08,949 --> 00:41:11,383
...if I so much get my feelings hurt.
- I don't care!

446
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,110
Do I have to yell "suwee"?

447
00:41:13,287 --> 00:41:15,255
Why don't we make up,
be pleasant for once?

448
00:41:15,422 --> 00:41:18,255
Why don't we pass the evening
like pleasant human beings?

449
00:41:18,425 --> 00:41:20,689
I like your nickel suit, cowboy.

450
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,283
You see something?

451
00:41:49,523 --> 00:41:51,320
Just a bird.

452
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,995
<i>The month of October came...</i>

453
00:41:57,164 --> 00:42:00,600
<i>...and Jesse began seeing
Pinkerton operatives in every floor walker...</i>

454
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:05,171
<i>...street sweeper, and common man
poking about in a store.</i>

455
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,966
<i>On the morning of the 11 th,
he would wake his wife...</i>

456
00:42:10,144 --> 00:42:14,342
<i>...with the Scripture pertaining to
the Holy Family's flight into Egypt.</i>

457
00:42:18,085 --> 00:42:22,988
<i>Overnight, the Thomas Howard clan
vanished from Kansas City.</i>

458
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:36,129
<i>Shortly thereafter,
four of the Blue Cut train robbers...</i>

459
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:39,136
<i>...were arrested in shacks near Glendale.</i>

460
00:42:44,178 --> 00:42:47,875
<i>How Jesse could have known
remains a mystery.</i>

461
00:42:59,927 --> 00:43:02,919
<i>Theirs was a wandering existence.</i>

462
00:43:03,097 --> 00:43:04,792
<i>Men who choose to be outlaws...</i>

463
00:43:04,965 --> 00:43:08,901
<i>...cannot afford to remain in one place
for very long.</i>

464
00:43:17,945 --> 00:43:22,211
- Well, goodness. Maybe I'll change my mind.
- Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

465
00:43:22,383 --> 00:43:24,613
- Martha.
- Buck up, man.

466
00:43:24,785 --> 00:43:28,346
<i>Wood and Dick would bicker
across the entire state of Kentucky...</i>

467
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:33,482
<i>...until they made Russellville, home
of Major George Hite, Wood's father...</i>

468
00:43:33,661 --> 00:43:36,789
<i>...and uncle to Frank and Jesse James.</i>

469
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,033
You stay away from this one.

470
00:43:47,808 --> 00:43:49,833
She's my daddy's wife.

471
00:43:50,778 --> 00:43:52,109
You got it?

472
00:44:16,036 --> 00:44:17,663
Did you cook this, ma'am?

473
00:44:20,974 --> 00:44:23,238
I've got a nigger woman.

474
00:44:25,346 --> 00:44:26,370
How's that?

475
00:44:30,818 --> 00:44:34,185
Dick asked if I cooked this.

476
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:35,911
Did you?

477
00:44:38,492 --> 00:44:39,516
No.

478
00:44:48,736 --> 00:44:51,170
She knew what he was like
when she married him.

479
00:45:17,698 --> 00:45:21,930
I guess we're the night owls, you and I.

480
00:45:23,337 --> 00:45:25,168
I'm glad.

481
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:28,907
How come?

482
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:32,504
You're interesting to look at.

483
00:45:33,414 --> 00:45:36,906
You have a real pleasant disposition.

484
00:45:38,552 --> 00:45:42,488
And I don't know, you sort of
make me feel warm all over.

485
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:49,155
You know, I'm what they call a...
An inamorato.

486
00:45:53,033 --> 00:45:57,732
Well, I knew
there had to be a name for it.

487
00:46:01,575 --> 00:46:03,736
You and the Hites
don't get along too well...

488
00:46:03,911 --> 00:46:07,176
...if I'm to trust Wood and his version
of the situation.

489
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:11,875
We hate each other like poison,
if you wanna know the truth.

490
00:46:12,553 --> 00:46:16,250
Most of the Hites wouldn't spit on me
if I was on fire.

491
00:46:18,492 --> 00:46:21,290
They say that when a woman's on fire...

492
00:46:21,462 --> 00:46:25,899
...you're supposed to roll her around on
the ground and cover her with your body.

493
00:46:27,234 --> 00:46:29,964
Well, you are a naughty tease.

494
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:38,842
Isn't it about bedtime?

495
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:43,047
Well, I'll just kiss those dainty nubbins.

496
00:46:56,997 --> 00:46:58,396
Good night.

497
00:47:12,846 --> 00:47:13,938
Would you stop?

498
00:47:19,219 --> 00:47:23,246
Boy, I believe I drank too much coffee.

499
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,293
I gotta go visit the privy
something terrible.

500
00:47:59,593 --> 00:48:01,891
This is embarrassing.

501
00:48:02,563 --> 00:48:06,624
Now, you go ahead and do your duty.
I don't mind.

502
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:11,862
I've sort of got stage fright with
a strange man in the commode with me.

503
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:13,563
I ain't strange.

504
00:48:13,874 --> 00:48:16,775
I'm built just like the rest of them.

505
00:48:19,513 --> 00:48:22,607
You look awful pretty.

506
00:48:24,017 --> 00:48:25,780
Do I?

507
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:30,817
I haven't never in my life seen
such well-shaped limbs.

508
00:48:38,398 --> 00:48:40,525
Is Wood awake?

509
00:48:42,769 --> 00:48:44,031
It's just me.

510
00:48:52,879 --> 00:48:55,814
And I bet you thought I was a lady.

511
00:49:42,629 --> 00:49:44,961
Well, you ain't much of a housekeeper,
are you?

512
00:49:48,301 --> 00:49:49,996
You didn't just happen by.

513
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,101
Why not?

514
00:50:21,368 --> 00:50:24,269
Go on and take a load off your feet.

515
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,355
You ought to get yourself a wife.

516
00:50:51,732 --> 00:50:53,097
Yeah.

517
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:55,164
I suppose.

518
00:50:58,538 --> 00:51:01,769
I was gonna ask Martha. Charley's sister.

519
00:51:01,942 --> 00:51:05,309
I was gonna ask her
if she could imagine it.

520
00:51:06,546 --> 00:51:09,413
But I guess Wood has plans of his own.

521
00:51:10,016 --> 00:51:12,644
And there's always Dick Liddil
getting in the way.

522
00:51:13,754 --> 00:51:15,722
I'll give it some thought, though.

523
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,458
Your crops come in?

524
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:24,756
No, I don't got much.
Just a garden patch and a pasture.

525
00:51:27,033 --> 00:51:29,399
I was sick at planting time.

526
00:51:30,403 --> 00:51:31,802
So...

527
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:36,339
Ed, how you feeling now?

528
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,237
Why?

529
00:51:42,149 --> 00:51:44,344
You're acting queer.

530
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:56,522
Well, you and me ain't been
just real good friends lately.

531
00:51:57,497 --> 00:52:00,591
That's not your fault,
you understand that.

532
00:52:02,936 --> 00:52:04,563
You hear talk, though.

533
00:52:06,606 --> 00:52:08,096
Talk?

534
00:52:11,912 --> 00:52:14,142
People tell you things.

535
00:52:21,688 --> 00:52:23,781
Why don't you give me an example?

536
00:52:28,094 --> 00:52:30,221
Jim Cummins come by here.

537
00:52:31,865 --> 00:52:33,196
Jim Cummins.

538
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,699
Oh, and Jim says:

539
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,936
"You know them boys
that got caught in the Blue Cut deal?"

540
00:52:46,012 --> 00:52:49,641
Well, Jim says he got word...

541
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:56,380
...that you're planning to kill them.

542
00:52:58,225 --> 00:53:00,489
Why would I do that?

543
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,556
That's just talk probably.

544
00:53:08,568 --> 00:53:12,402
Jim Cummins. He say anything else?

545
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:16,640
Nope. No, that was it, basically.

546
00:53:27,053 --> 00:53:29,453
That still don't explain why you're scared.

547
00:53:33,093 --> 00:53:35,960
Well, I'm in the same situation, you see.

548
00:53:36,696 --> 00:53:38,721
I was terrified I saw you ride up.

549
00:53:39,366 --> 00:53:42,358
- I just happened by, Ed.
- Suppose you heard gossip, though.

550
00:53:42,535 --> 00:53:45,470
Suppose you heard Jim Cummins
come by, you might have thought...

551
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:50,599
...that we were planning to capture you
or get that reward, and that ain't true.

552
00:53:50,777 --> 00:53:53,075
But you might have suspected it.

553
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:14,025
Haven't heard a lick of gossip lately.

554
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:18,637
I got 600 dollars stashed away.
I don't need no governor's reward.

555
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:23,475
Well, it's the principle too.

556
00:54:28,481 --> 00:54:29,971
Well...

557
00:54:30,283 --> 00:54:33,775
- I'm glad I stopped by.
- Oh, me too.

558
00:54:58,578 --> 00:55:01,638
What do you say
if we were to go for a ride?

559
00:55:06,586 --> 00:55:09,453
We can go into town. I'll buy you dinner.

560
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:13,355
Then I'll be on my way.

561
00:55:22,335 --> 00:55:24,064
Okay.

562
00:56:24,497 --> 00:56:26,226
You ready to go for a ride?

563
00:56:42,015 --> 00:56:44,381
We going to your place?

564
00:56:49,222 --> 00:56:51,349
You seen Ed Miller lately?

565
00:56:52,725 --> 00:56:54,852
Nobody has.

566
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,259
Must have gone off to California.

567
00:57:05,305 --> 00:57:07,637
I'd still like to know where we're going.

568
00:57:12,812 --> 00:57:16,714
If you were going to see Jim Cummins,
wouldn't you follow this road?

569
00:57:22,155 --> 00:57:23,986
I guess so.

570
00:58:06,933 --> 00:58:08,400
Howdy.

571
00:58:19,279 --> 00:58:21,406
Oh, are you friends of my pa's?

572
00:58:26,486 --> 00:58:28,317
We're friends of Jim Cummins.

573
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:35,359
Well, it so happens
he's been gone since August.

574
00:58:35,528 --> 00:58:37,587
And never said where he gone to.

575
00:58:42,502 --> 00:58:45,733
- I'm Matt Collins.
- Albert Ford.

576
00:58:45,905 --> 00:58:47,873
Very happy to meet you.

577
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:57,072
- Dick Turpin.
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.

578
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,787
I don't know where he is!
Leave me alone!

579
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:13,728
Shut your mouth!
You shut your mouth!

580
00:59:15,702 --> 00:59:18,569
- You shut your mouth.
- I don't know where he is!

581
00:59:19,272 --> 00:59:21,297
- I don't know!
- Get in there.

582
00:59:22,175 --> 00:59:23,199
Shut up.

583
00:59:23,376 --> 00:59:25,867
- I don't know where he is!
- Shut up.

584
00:59:26,946 --> 00:59:28,413
- I don't know!
- Shut up.

585
00:59:28,581 --> 00:59:29,639
- Jesus.
- Shut up.

586
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,909
Jesse, he's just a kid.

587
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:35,981
He knows where his uncle Jim is and
that's gonna make him old soon enough.

588
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:38,453
- Maybe he doesn't know.
- He knows!

589
00:59:38,625 --> 00:59:40,286
You need to ask and ask sometimes.

590
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:44,089
Sometimes a child don't remember so much
at first. But it'll come back to him.

591
00:59:46,132 --> 00:59:48,657
My goodness, she's about to rip off,
sweetie.

592
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,826
Just a little more here to get her started.

593
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,768
Then I think I can rip her off
like a page from a book.

594
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:56,033
Jesus, he can't even talk.

595
00:59:58,878 --> 01:00:00,436
Where's Jim?

596
01:00:00,613 --> 01:00:02,080
Where's Jim?

597
01:00:02,248 --> 01:00:04,216
Where's Jim? Where's Jim?

598
01:00:04,384 --> 01:00:07,751
Where's Jim? Where's Jim? Where's Jim?

599
01:00:08,087 --> 01:00:10,351
- Where's Jim?
- Quit it!

600
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:13,257
You bastard! I don't know where he is!

601
01:00:13,426 --> 01:00:16,293
You won't believe me!
You never even gave me a chance!

602
01:00:16,462 --> 01:00:18,453
You kept my... You kept my mouth shut!

603
01:00:19,832 --> 01:00:23,233
I never know where Jim is or
when he comes! So leave me alone.

604
01:00:23,403 --> 01:00:25,837
Get off me, you son of a bitch!

605
01:01:18,891 --> 01:01:20,825
I'm worn out.

606
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:23,927
I can't. No, see...

607
01:01:26,966 --> 01:01:29,526
My mind's all tangled anyway.

608
01:01:30,069 --> 01:01:33,527
Little deals like this
just make me feel dirty.

609
01:01:54,594 --> 01:01:56,619
Are you all right, Jesse?

610
01:02:25,191 --> 01:02:27,022
<i>Jesse was sick...</i>

611
01:02:27,193 --> 01:02:31,653
<i>...with rheums, and aches
and lung congestions.</i>

612
01:02:32,532 --> 01:02:35,831
<i>Insomnia stained
his eye sockets like soot.</i>

613
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:39,661
<i>He read auguries in
the snarled intestines of chickens...</i>

614
01:02:40,873 --> 01:02:44,434
<i>...or the blow of cat hair
released to the wind.</i>

615
01:02:45,244 --> 01:02:50,204
<i>And the omens promised bad luck,
which moated and dungeoned him.</i>

616
01:03:31,924 --> 01:03:34,484
How come it's you
that's gotta do all the chores?

617
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:38,892
Charley and Bob pay extry to Martha
so that they don't have to.

618
01:03:40,199 --> 01:03:42,258
It still don't seem fair.

619
01:03:49,041 --> 01:03:50,565
Martha.

620
01:03:52,311 --> 01:03:54,905
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

621
01:03:59,719 --> 01:04:00,981
You come from Kentucky?

622
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:08,224
Why do you have your head in a hole,
Martha?

623
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:14,995
Wood and Dick had a shooting scrape
a few months ago.

624
01:04:16,569 --> 01:04:17,831
Cover the kettle, Ida.

625
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:25,407
And what did you and Dick
get in a scrape about?

626
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:33,275
Well, he tampered
with my daddy's wife...

627
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:36,819
...while a pork chop
burned on the skillet...

628
01:04:36,989 --> 01:04:38,513
...so I shot at him.

629
01:04:43,596 --> 01:04:47,999
Ida! Do not stick your thumb
in the cream when you skim it.

630
01:04:49,168 --> 01:04:54,367
His chicanery and his philandering ways...

631
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:56,508
...has instigated such malice.

632
01:04:56,676 --> 01:05:00,612
He's a yellow snake in the grass
and he can't be trusted, Martha.

633
01:05:03,516 --> 01:05:06,883
Dick told me a complete other version
of that affray.

634
01:05:08,354 --> 01:05:11,016
Wood Hite's downstairs.

635
01:05:11,724 --> 01:05:13,419
You mean he's here?

636
01:05:16,195 --> 01:05:18,891
Yeah, he come in late last night.

637
01:05:22,602 --> 01:05:23,626
Hey, simmer down!

638
01:05:23,803 --> 01:05:28,365
Don't get into a fracas up there, you boys!
I've got breakfast almost ready.

639
01:07:39,271 --> 01:07:41,466
He's still sucking air.

640
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:44,836
But I think he's a goner.

641
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:58,286
Maybe y'all better come wish him well
on his journey.

642
01:08:25,084 --> 01:08:26,551
Wood?

643
01:08:28,988 --> 01:08:31,252
You were a good fellow, Wood.

644
01:08:31,490 --> 01:08:34,982
Oh, I sure hope you're not
in frightful pain, Wood.

645
01:08:35,561 --> 01:08:39,292
I'd get you something to drink,
but I'm afraid you'd just choke on it.

646
01:08:40,666 --> 01:08:42,827
Little Ida's gonna miss you.

647
01:08:43,002 --> 01:08:45,129
So is the rest of the family.

648
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:51,969
Well, one thing's settled.
Can't take him into Richmond.

649
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:54,103
Why not?

650
01:08:55,581 --> 01:08:58,141
Well, one, sheriff'll put Bob in jail.

651
01:08:58,317 --> 01:09:02,185
And two, Jesse'll find out his cousin
Wood's been shot in our house...

652
01:09:02,354 --> 01:09:05,755
...and then that'll be the end
of each and every one of us.

653
01:09:15,668 --> 01:09:19,331
"And in one merciless, violent thrust
broke in...

654
01:09:19,772 --> 01:09:22,605
...and carried all before him,
and scented and brewed...

655
01:09:22,775 --> 01:09:25,300
...reeking with blood of my virginity...

656
01:09:25,477 --> 01:09:30,005
...up to its utmost length in my body."

657
01:09:31,617 --> 01:09:34,484
He ain't disappeared,
if that's what you were hoping.

658
01:09:38,958 --> 01:09:40,926
What chapter you on?

659
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:46,455
She's met some Algerian corsair
down at Gibraltar.

660
01:09:46,632 --> 01:09:48,930
Got herself all agitated.

661
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:52,703
How's that leg?

662
01:09:53,505 --> 01:09:57,669
Full of torment, Bob. Thanks for asking.

663
01:10:43,555 --> 01:10:46,217
<i>Blessed are the poor in spirit...</i>

664
01:10:46,392 --> 01:10:48,656
<i>...for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</i>

665
01:10:50,095 --> 01:10:55,658
Blessed are them that mourn,
for they shall be comforted.

666
01:10:57,803 --> 01:10:59,737
Blessed are the...

667
01:11:03,275 --> 01:11:04,799
Meek.

668
01:11:07,079 --> 01:11:08,910
Blessed are the meek.

669
01:11:44,883 --> 01:11:46,942
- Is it him?
- Yeah.

670
01:11:47,119 --> 01:11:50,145
Why is he here? Does he know
about Wood, do you think?

671
01:11:50,322 --> 01:11:52,722
I don't know. All I know is
he don't miss very much.

672
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:56,850
- What should I say about you if he asks?
- Tell him I'm in K.C. with Mattie.

673
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:03,365
He was buffalo hunting.
He was thrilled to meet yours truly.

674
01:12:03,535 --> 01:12:07,471
Yeah, over there in Europe there's only
two Americans they know for certain...

675
01:12:07,639 --> 01:12:10,574
...Mark Twain and Jesse James.

676
01:12:11,944 --> 01:12:15,175
- Why, it's the kid.
- How's everything?

677
01:12:17,616 --> 01:12:20,210
- I never take off my gun belts.
- Yeah?

678
01:12:20,386 --> 01:12:21,944
Good thinking.

679
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:30,324
Well, Charley, did you hurt your leg?

680
01:12:32,865 --> 01:12:34,890
Yeah, I slipped...
I slipped off the roof...

681
01:12:35,067 --> 01:12:38,662
...and I smacked down into a snow bank
like a ton of stupidness.

682
01:12:38,837 --> 01:12:41,499
One second I'm screaming,
"Whoa, Nelly!"

683
01:12:41,673 --> 01:12:44,335
Next second, poof,
I'm neck-deep in snow.

684
01:12:47,246 --> 01:12:51,080
Well, whatever possessed you
to climb a roof in December?

685
01:12:57,089 --> 01:13:00,547
There was a k... A kite. What am I saying?
There was a cat.

686
01:13:00,726 --> 01:13:03,126
A cat. It was on the roof
and I went after him.
