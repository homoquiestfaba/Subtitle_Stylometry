1
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,557
No way.

2
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,191
Come on up.
Feed the clowns, lady.

3
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,887
For $3, everybody wins a prize.

4
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,355
Feed 'em up.
Here, hon. Here, hon.

5
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,295
Feed those clowns!

6
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,699
Hey, here, boys.
Come here, boys.

7
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,813
All right!

8
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:40,299
Hey, lover boy!
Quit eyein' up the jills.

9
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:42,873
Go get ready!

10
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,908
Keep moving, missy.

11
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,238
Right this way...

12
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,049
Hey, hey, hey.
All right.

13
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,525
No, thank you.

14
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,098
The road to excitement

15
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,571
starts right through
these doors.

16
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,841
The world's strongest man!

17
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:26,547
And jugglers!
The terrifying face mangler!

18
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,343
Unicyclists and our main acts,

19
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,149
which you have to see
to believe.

20
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:38,220
Can you feel the heat,
ladies and gentlemen?

21
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,356
Prepare to be amazed,

22
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,755
terrified.

23
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,935
Titillated and amused.
From all corners of the globe,

24
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:49,769
the deepest jungles,
the driest deserts,

25
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,331
the highest mountains,

26
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:53,374
we've got you
the best of the best,

27
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,709
the greatest of the great,

28
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,882
the most marvelous
of all the marvels.

29
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,845
Our jugglers were trained in
the royal courts of the czars.

30
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,379
Our beauties were chosen

31
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,114
from the finest
Europe has to offer.

32
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,523
So sit back,

33
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,552
relax,

34
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:14,688
and get ready
for Circus Marvelous!

35
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,437
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

36
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:27,272
the moment you've
all been waiting for.

37
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:30,809
No noise.

38
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,172
No photographs.

39
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,519
Let your heads and minds fly

40
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,646
with a man

41
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:41,817
who defies gravity.
Who defies science.

42
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:45,091
Who defies your imagination.

43
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:46,992
Our one,

44
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,030
our only

45
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,992
death-defying.

46
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,865
Lady-sighing.

47
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,403
Trapeze-flying

48
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,340
aerialist!

49
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:52,786
Look!

50
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:47,881
Yeah!

51
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:46,805
Him?

52
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:11,566
Do you know him?

53
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:44,295
Have you seen...

54
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,012
Hi!

55
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:33,080
Help!

56
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:53,062
Help!

57
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:57,701
Help!

58
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,214
Mia!

59
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:44,351
Mia!

60
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:47,194
Mia!

61
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:37,769
Mia?
