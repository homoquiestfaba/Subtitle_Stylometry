1
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:15,374
- I'm not career oriented.
- Sure.

2
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,311
If I were a wife, I would
be called a housewife.

3
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:21,880
I'm good at doing this.
I take care of the house.

4
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:27,255
Just because we're adjoined at
one little part of our bodies...

5
00:01:27,256 --> 00:01:29,990
doesn't mean we're
same person.

6
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:33,328
We're two separate people
with two separate identities.

7
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,731
We can come very
close to each other.

8
00:01:35,732 --> 00:01:38,099
Or we can go way
apart from each other.

9
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,335
No! No! No!
Of course I've dated.

10
00:01:40,336 --> 00:01:42,470
- I'm normal.
- Of course.

11
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:43,737
This is really sad.

12
00:01:43,738 --> 00:01:45,705
No. This shit's a trip
if you ask me.

13
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:49,778
No. The fact that this
woman has 150 pounds...

14
00:01:49,779 --> 00:01:52,245
of human attached
to her head.

15
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:54,349
And she probably has
more sex than I do.

16
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,683
It's an automatic two-fer.

17
00:01:55,684 --> 00:01:57,987
You think one really just
sits there playing solitaire...

18
00:01:57,988 --> 00:02:00,518
while the other one's
getting busy?

19
00:02:02,891 --> 00:02:07,152
I obviously didn't think
that one through.

20
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,868
Where you going?

21
00:02:13,869 --> 00:02:15,937
I'm taking Jane to dinner.

22
00:02:15,938 --> 00:02:18,341
Man, you should just donate
that food to the homeless.

23
00:02:18,342 --> 00:02:20,668
You'd get a lot more
satisfaction that way.

24
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:23,979
This may be hard to
comprehend, Lorenzo...

25
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,084
but some guys have to actually
work for a female's affection.

26
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:28,350
And that includes
paying for dinner.

27
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:32,782
It's a labor of love.
Jane's a sweatshop.

28
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:35,325
If she were to be told
today that she would get...

29
00:02:35,326 --> 00:02:36,925
a million dollars to
do a naughty scene...

30
00:02:36,926 --> 00:02:39,457
she would not do it.

31
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:42,597
Come on. She's not
exploiting me.

32
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:46,036
If you went to college and took
psych. I took psychology.

33
00:02:46,037 --> 00:02:50,103
They say that once you get 26
you are over the hill.

34
00:03:04,688 --> 00:03:08,687
Woman, you can
wait right here.

35
00:03:18,203 --> 00:03:22,703
Finna commence the hostile
takeover of all y'all dividends!

36
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:26,400
Where's Simon?

37
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:33,052
Hell no! Don't tell me I'm going all in
with just you two motherfuckers again!

38
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:35,354
Don't tell me he's doing
the same old same old with...

39
00:03:35,355 --> 00:03:37,317
that bitch!

40
00:03:41,292 --> 00:03:44,194
So, Annette said she
saw Max eating sushi...

41
00:03:44,195 --> 00:03:46,332
with one of his
groupies last night.

42
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,365
Firemen have groupies?

43
00:03:47,366 --> 00:03:50,125
Yeah, they're called firehoes.

44
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:52,702
And I know this new one is
just trying to backdraft off...

45
00:03:52,703 --> 00:03:55,568
my relationship problems with
Max to hook up with him.

46
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:58,555
You and Max broke
up over a year ago.

47
00:03:58,556 --> 00:04:02,101
- I ended it.
- It was my decision.

48
00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:05,717
It's just been so hard trying
to new guys in the city.

49
00:04:05,718 --> 00:04:08,978
I mean the selection is so stale.

50
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:12,290
And between all the suits,
skaters, and indie boys...

51
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,495
there's just not much for a
girl to get worked up about.

52
00:04:14,496 --> 00:04:17,029
Maybe you should
lower your standards.

53
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,101
Simon, he got that scientist
intellectual shine to him, right.

54
00:04:20,102 --> 00:04:22,201
I mean his cerebellum
be swelling and all,

55
00:04:22,202 --> 00:04:24,631
but he need to do some
research on his own self.

56
00:04:25,872 --> 00:04:29,710
That girl got his brain
discombobulated, blood.

57
00:04:29,711 --> 00:04:33,243
So are you seeing anyone?

58
00:04:34,247 --> 00:04:36,113
No, not right now.

59
00:04:36,114 --> 00:04:38,612
Well, why not?

60
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:45,227
How's the boy supposed to get shot
down if he just sits there idolizing?

61
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:47,880
Hey, man, why do you want
your boy to crash and burn?

62
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:50,499
- Make a move and move on.
- That's all I'm saying.

63
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,367
Trust me, I got
Simon's back.

64
00:04:52,368 --> 00:04:53,834
Like a chiropractor!

65
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,805
Yeah, but how do you know
Jane is going to shut him down?

66
00:04:56,806 --> 00:04:59,496
I just know.

67
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,332
Call me.

68
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:36,908
Man, this how players
smoke, all right?

69
00:05:37,747 --> 00:05:40,014
It's hard to put 'em on
the line for a woman.

70
00:05:40,015 --> 00:05:42,718
I did, and you all know
what happened to me.

71
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:44,353
Here we go again.

72
00:05:44,354 --> 00:05:45,787
Yeah man, but look how
great you're doing now.

73
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:47,691
You're deejaying again.
You even you rushed that frat.

74
00:05:47,692 --> 00:05:51,292
Yeah dog. Look. Look.
Pop the collar.

75
00:05:53,263 --> 00:05:54,796
Hey yo. I fold.

76
00:05:54,797 --> 00:05:57,761
There ain't no
flop yet, man.

77
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:01,136
I got pocket rockets!

78
00:06:01,137 --> 00:06:02,872
I thought you kids
wanted to play cards!

79
00:06:02,873 --> 00:06:04,742
I didn't know you wanted
to hold each other's nuts...

80
00:06:04,743 --> 00:06:06,142
and love each other!

81
00:06:06,143 --> 00:06:10,210
This is why you guys
fuck fat chicks! Fools!

82
00:06:16,887 --> 00:06:18,884
You coming?

83
00:06:47,686 --> 00:06:50,718
I am the man right now!

84
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:54,520
Somebody tell me
I am the man.

85
00:06:55,727 --> 00:06:57,416
You're the man.

86
00:06:59,098 --> 00:07:00,532
Trese.

87
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:02,400
Just checking up
on my babies.

88
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:04,736
You know, Simon,
it's really sad to see...

89
00:07:04,737 --> 00:07:07,704
someone so desperate
for validation.

90
00:07:11,077 --> 00:07:13,713
Simon, did you know
that men and mice...

91
00:07:13,714 --> 00:07:16,216
are sixty percent
genetically identical?

92
00:07:16,217 --> 00:07:18,112
Yes I did.

93
00:07:18,751 --> 00:07:20,952
They grow up so fast.

94
00:07:20,953 --> 00:07:24,522
The little ones reach their sexual
maturity after just one month.

95
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:26,627
After that they need
to be separated.

96
00:07:26,628 --> 00:07:28,060
Because if you don't...

97
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:29,930
the brothers will start
mating with their sisters.

98
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:31,364
They don't care.

99
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:35,002
They just give in to their
biological need to reproduce.

100
00:07:35,003 --> 00:07:38,606
It's kind of what men do when
they interact with women.

101
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:41,001
Maybe it's in your genes.

102
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:49,480
My roommate set me up
with this guy tonight.

103
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:54,488
You really let someone
fix you up?

104
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:58,059
Wow, it's so sad to see someone
so desperate for affection.

105
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,596
Yeah, well, this guy didn't see
tonight as a chance to meet.

106
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:05,232
For him it was just an
opportunity to mate.

107
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:09,471
A man's brain is 3000 times
bigger than that of a mouse...

108
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:11,840
and yet it works
exactly the same.

109
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:14,074
You're a genius, Trese.

110
00:08:14,075 --> 00:08:17,644
Well, I'm an expert at
categorizing mice

111
00:08:17,645 --> 00:08:20,248
which means I can do pretty
much the same with men.

112
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,519
Do you have me
categorized?

113
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,719
Well, from my observation...

114
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,123
you are in the same category
as the guy I got fixed up with.

115
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:30,658
And what's that?

116
00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:33,628
Guys who are getting
no action tonight.

117
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:37,233
It's not by circumstance.
I'm here by choice.

118
00:08:37,234 --> 00:08:39,867
Bye Simon.

119
00:08:41,136 --> 00:08:43,171
I'm here of my
own free will!

120
00:08:43,172 --> 00:08:45,776
Trese, don't tell me you cut out
of another date...

121
00:08:45,777 --> 00:08:47,810
to write one of your poems.

122
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:51,479
I thought we decided you
needed to socialize more.

123
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,778
When creativity hits you
just have to roll with it.

124
00:08:56,586 --> 00:08:59,355
Is this another one
about the racist,

125
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:05,129
misogynistic, exploitative,
capitalistic society that we live in?

126
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,098
- The struggle continues.
- Let me see that.

127
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:09,531
Give it back!

128
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:11,485
"I am I am I am nothing".

129
00:09:11,486 --> 00:09:13,594
"Not a color.
Not a curve".

130
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:16,335
"Kissed all the
girls but me".

131
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:20,239
Wait. I'm not finished.

132
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:25,383
"And then I turned around and
God her hair was on fire".

133
00:09:25,384 --> 00:09:29,921
"She walks alone. You tell me
I am not that she".

134
00:09:29,922 --> 00:09:34,819
"I say I am, I am, I am".

135
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:42,447
- So who's the guy?
- There is no guy!

136
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:47,699
Really?
There's no guy involved?

137
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:50,309
Okay I lied.
There is a guy.

138
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,528
I knew it.

139
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:54,713
- Name.
- Simon.

140
00:09:54,714 --> 00:09:56,676
Story.

141
00:09:56,882 --> 00:10:03,111
Girl likes boy. Boy likes
someone else. The end.

142
00:10:35,288 --> 00:10:38,513
Go! Go! Go!

143
00:10:48,836 --> 00:10:50,605
- Amen!
- Amen.

144
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:52,966
Coach!

145
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,641
I'm sorry I missed
that last shot.

146
00:10:55,642 --> 00:11:00,648
Oh, don't blame yourself.
It's god's fault.

147
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:01,914
Huh?

148
00:11:01,915 --> 00:11:10,526
Um, don't we thank
Him when we win?

149
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:12,292
Yeah.

150
00:11:12,293 --> 00:11:20,033
Okay, well... if he gets the
credit when things go right...

151
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:25,535
shouldn't he take the blame when
things don't work out for us?

152
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:31,943
Okay, why don'tyou
just go reflect on that?

153
00:11:43,626 --> 00:11:45,486
Simon!

154
00:11:47,563 --> 00:11:50,198
Another late night, eh?

155
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:54,300
You've got to pace yourself.
You're going to be here for a while.

156
00:11:54,837 --> 00:11:59,240
You see that, Gilly?
In two more months...

157
00:11:59,241 --> 00:12:03,780
my signature will be accompanied
with the letters P-H-D, my friend.

158
00:12:03,781 --> 00:12:08,285
You know, I spent the best years
of my life fondling a microscope...

159
00:12:08,286 --> 00:12:11,188
and there are two things that
kept me from going insane.

160
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:14,008
One of them is knowing
that every grad student...

161
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:16,759
is going to share the same
shitty existence as me.

162
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,632
So you can't tell me you're going
to be out of here in three years.

163
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:23,667
You haven't even
paid your dues yet.

164
00:12:23,668 --> 00:12:26,324
Two years.

165
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,470
Whatever.

166
00:12:28,471 --> 00:12:32,107
What's the other thing that
keeps you from going crazy?

167
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,402
Her.

168
00:12:38,182 --> 00:12:40,315
Trese?

169
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:45,490
- You ever notice her?
- No.

170
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:47,118
No?

171
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,456
I got your test
tube right here.

172
00:12:52,463 --> 00:12:54,357
Hey.

173
00:13:00,472 --> 00:13:02,958
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
What are you doing?

174
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,376
- What up Si Guy?
- What're you doing here?

175
00:13:05,377 --> 00:13:08,748
Check it! Covonne's spinning
at a party this Saturday.

176
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:10,781
Frat house!

177
00:13:10,782 --> 00:13:14,713
Now what we need to do is we gotta
start rounding some people up.

178
00:13:14,953 --> 00:13:18,588
Hey, is it cool
if I come?

179
00:13:23,462 --> 00:13:27,567
- Damn girl! Game on!
- Oh hell no! Game paused!

180
00:13:27,568 --> 00:13:28,800
Hey guys!

181
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:31,036
- Harlen!
- Yo, what's happening, man?

182
00:13:31,037 --> 00:13:34,973
You're blowing up all
atomic like there, dude.

183
00:13:34,974 --> 00:13:39,813
Yeah, you heard of the afro?
Well, this is the anglo. You like?

184
00:13:39,814 --> 00:13:42,182
You can bounce a quarter
off this shit. It's great!

185
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:45,052
Damn, I gotta get
me one of those!

186
00:13:45,053 --> 00:13:47,888
Shit cost me two bills.
You like it?

187
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:50,389
It makes a statement.

188
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,795
Yeah, it says, "Since I can't
hold a permanent job,

189
00:13:52,796 --> 00:13:54,829
keep a permanent girlfriend"...

190
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,862
"well then, fuck it!"

191
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:58,231
"At least I can give
my hair a permanent".

192
00:13:58,232 --> 00:14:01,069
And if I don't like it, it will
wear off in a week and a half.

193
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,568
- That's good.
- Word.

194
00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:04,706
I hopeyou don't mind,
I brought my boy Riles.

195
00:14:04,707 --> 00:14:06,391
- That's fine.
- Take it easy.

196
00:14:06,392 --> 00:14:08,042
I gotta go make
my move.

197
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:09,175
He's nice.

198
00:14:09,176 --> 00:14:13,081
You think that would look good on me, man?
Right on top of the dome and all.

199
00:14:13,082 --> 00:14:16,545
Yo, howyou be
activating that?

200
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,787
Is that top made
out of mesh?

201
00:14:23,788 --> 00:14:26,317
Looks like
oranges in socks.

202
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:31,734
Happening party. I never come
to a party empty-handed.

203
00:14:31,735 --> 00:14:33,000
The hell is this?

204
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:38,207
Page 43. Last year's draft.
Twelfth round. Fullback.

205
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:42,058
Grant Riley aka. Riles.

206
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:46,541
Right there.
That's me.

207
00:14:49,285 --> 00:14:52,283
Autographed.

208
00:14:53,989 --> 00:15:00,396
Wow. So you actually
play professional ball?

209
00:15:00,397 --> 00:15:02,363
Well, not since I got cut...

210
00:15:02,364 --> 00:15:08,138
But I'll be back on thefield, and you guys
will be, like, "I know that dude. Whoo!"

211
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:11,141
You want one too?
I got more in the car.

212
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:14,111
- Yeah, I'm good. Thank you.
- You sure?

213
00:15:14,112 --> 00:15:18,144
- We'll share it.
- Thank you.

214
00:15:19,282 --> 00:15:22,553
Who brings this to a party?
Score!

215
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,720
- Hey!
- Hey!

216
00:15:24,721 --> 00:15:26,722
Who's the big guy?

217
00:15:26,723 --> 00:15:33,631
His name is Riles. He's some
meathead that came with Harlen.

218
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:38,324
- What do you have to drink?
- Right here.

219
00:15:39,803 --> 00:15:41,808
You're the only guy that I know...

220
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:44,242
that carries a mirror
around in his front pocket.

221
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:47,212
That's so you can
see yourself anytime.

222
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:51,541
I know.
It's comforting.

223
00:15:57,989 --> 00:16:03,490
- Thanks.
- Uh, yeah. You're welcome.

224
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:13,488
Yo. It's the revolutionist
party leader himself.

224
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:15,608
What? Not enough people?

225
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:17,677
Look, man, we did what we could
on short notice. All right?

226
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:18,743
You brought alcohol!

227
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,611
Yeah I brought alcohol,
and I had to buy it myself.

228
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,515
What kind of fraternity doesn't
have something to sip on?

229
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:24,100
It's not that type
of fraternity!

230
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:25,616
What type of frat house is it?

231
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:31,022
It's a House of God!
What have you done, man?

232
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,025
House of what?

233
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:35,625
Lorenzo?

234
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,663
Anita.

235
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,365
You're the last person
I'd expect to see here.

236
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:45,033
Yeah well, you know... ain't no party
like a Holy Ghost party, right?

237
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,942
So what did you do in a
past life to end up here?

238
00:16:48,943 --> 00:16:51,629
This is Paul's old
stomping grounds.

239
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,801
He was Aota-Lota-Mu's
first president.

240
00:16:54,802 --> 00:16:59,787
- Oooh...
- Paul! Lorenzo. Lorenzo. Paul.

241
00:16:59,988 --> 00:17:04,784
- Hey.
- Whoa! Hey, tiger!

242
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:09,154
- Lorenzo.
- Yeah.

243
00:17:09,597 --> 00:17:12,959
Are you here
to embrace Christianity?

244
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:18,593
Good... Can you believe
this turnout, huh?

245
00:17:18,906 --> 00:17:23,509
I mean it's... uh,
it's of biblical proportions.

246
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,401
I knew it was only
a matter of time before...

247
00:17:26,402 --> 00:17:29,185
people began to accept
the word of our savior.

248
00:17:30,386 --> 00:17:32,753
I'm glad you're here.

249
00:17:32,754 --> 00:17:36,392
I'll get you a fruit punch.
No, I'm getting you fruit punch.

250
00:17:36,393 --> 00:17:39,083
Yeah, praise the Lord.

251
00:17:39,694 --> 00:17:42,865
After me, you settled for
the founding father of this?

252
00:17:42,866 --> 00:17:46,667
Oh! Nerd alert!
What? Hello!

253
00:17:46,668 --> 00:17:50,973
Come on now! If you can shake it
in the club, you can shake it for Jesus!

254
00:17:50,974 --> 00:17:54,176
Now, two of these girls,
they used to fight each other...

255
00:17:54,177 --> 00:17:55,976
and slap and stomp
all the time!

256
00:17:55,977 --> 00:17:59,237
Now they're slapping
and stomping for the Lord!

257
00:18:00,516 --> 00:18:05,949
Let's give it up for T-L-L!
The Lord's Ladies!

258
00:18:06,055 --> 00:18:11,960
"He's got a plan.
I know it's hard to understand".

259
00:18:11,961 --> 00:18:17,332
"You ready to praise him? Come on.
So you gotta praise him".

260
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:20,239
"When you ask him.
You better thank him".

261
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,273
"You stick around.
He will never let you down".

262
00:18:23,274 --> 00:18:25,625
Mother of Jesus.

263
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:28,609
Joseph, baby, momma.

264
00:18:29,613 --> 00:18:31,871
That's enough.

265
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:37,154
- Stop it! Stop it!
- What're you doing?

266
00:18:37,155 --> 00:18:40,550
You look like a
fucking retard!

267
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:44,827
You joined a
fucking cult?

268
00:18:44,828 --> 00:18:47,865
No, it's not a cult! I need
some direction in my life.

269
00:18:47,866 --> 00:18:50,201
And don't try to make
this a religious thing.

270
00:18:50,202 --> 00:18:52,468
Simon coaches basketball
at a Catholic school.

271
00:18:52,469 --> 00:18:54,673
He's not even Catholic, and you're
not on his case about that!

272
00:18:54,674 --> 00:18:56,807
Simon's just doing
that to impress Jane.

273
00:18:56,808 --> 00:19:02,275
He's not looking for a path to salvation.
He's looking for a path into her pants!

274
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:06,184
This isn't about that girl that
broke up with you. Is it?

275
00:19:06,185 --> 00:19:08,112
No.

276
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,815
I don't know.

277
00:19:13,893 --> 00:19:15,092
Hey!

277
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:19,957
Hey. I feel you, man.
I do. I really, really do.

278
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:25,163
But do you really think, that God
is gonna get you get laid?

279
00:19:25,871 --> 00:19:29,540
I don't know
what to do anymore, man.

280
00:19:31,577 --> 00:19:34,040
I think you do.

281
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,557
This shit right here is dangerous!
This shit right here will fuck you up!

282
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:49,162
This shit right here
is not to be touched!

283
00:19:49,163 --> 00:19:53,164
But still the party people
just can't get enough!

284
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:55,200
This is my song!

285
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:58,233
Come here girl! You know
you want to freak me!

286
00:20:20,895 --> 00:20:24,065
What actually got me first
noticed by the big boys was

287
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:26,301
I actually have an extra
muscle in my right arm.

288
00:20:26,302 --> 00:20:27,300
Shut your mouth!

289
00:20:27,301 --> 00:20:30,638
Yeah. Scientists said it was some kind
of deformity but what do they know?

290
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:34,273
- Yeah. Nothing.
- Let me get you something to drink.

291
00:20:43,484 --> 00:20:46,016
- Hey!
- Hey!

292
00:20:46,254 --> 00:20:50,626
Gilly mentioned a party. I thought
I'd just come and make an appearance.

293
00:20:50,627 --> 00:20:53,513
- Are you having a good time?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

294
00:20:53,514 --> 00:20:56,365
Except this beefy guy kept
trying to talk to me.

295
00:20:56,366 --> 00:20:58,132
I couldn't hear what
he was saying

296
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:02,269
but I think he was trying to sell
me a magazine subscription.

297
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:10,209
She's beautiful.

298
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,882
Oh, yeah.

299
00:21:13,883 --> 00:21:20,453
It's not like that. That's Jane.
We're just friends.

300
00:21:23,726 --> 00:21:28,453
- So have a good time.
- Yeah. You too.

301
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:38,808
So I see you met Riles.

302
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:40,910
Oh yeah. He
is so yolked.

303
00:21:40,911 --> 00:21:44,213
Did you know he was
in Sports lllustrated?

304
00:21:44,214 --> 00:21:45,938
Yeah.

305
00:21:47,484 --> 00:21:52,848
Did I ever mention that I had
two papers published in JAM?

306
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,658
Journal of American Medicine?

307
00:21:55,659 --> 00:22:00,796
Yeah, but Sports lllustrated,
that's like a real magazine.

308
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:24,488
Lord have mercy!

309
00:22:24,489 --> 00:22:27,606
Moses could not create
commandments

310
00:22:27,607 --> 00:22:31,355
for the things I want
to do to you.

311
00:22:34,165 --> 00:22:37,733
Take me to Sunday
School, girl!

312
00:23:14,407 --> 00:23:18,310
I don't know what Jane saw
in that Riles guy anyway.

313
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:21,582
I mean, minus everything that was
anabolically enhanced. Come on!

314
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:24,218
So he's probably not hung
like a triceratops, right?

315
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:26,151
But more than likely
just as dumb.

316
00:23:26,152 --> 00:23:29,946
Triceratops had a very
small brain to body ratio.

317
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:32,425
You know what Jane's
problem is?

318
00:23:32,426 --> 00:23:36,631
You know why she wastes her time on
all these self-destructive relationships?

319
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:40,802
It's because she's like this Sports
lllustrated, she has a ton of issues!

320
00:23:40,803 --> 00:23:43,670
Do you always have to think
like a fucking scientist?

321
00:23:43,671 --> 00:23:45,207
You can't keep coming up
with theories to explain...

322
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,641
everything that happens
in your life.

323
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:48,208
You want to know why
Jane isn't with you?

324
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:51,346
It's because she doesn't want to be.
That's it. Leave it alone.

325
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:54,080
Okay, first of all.
I am a scientist.

326
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:56,685
And secondly, I'll promise
to stow my baggage

327
00:23:56,686 --> 00:23:58,653
as long as you promise
to handle yours.

328
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:01,674
I don't really need any help.
I'm not really hurting for women.

329
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:04,660
That's weird, because we're sitting
at a train station in the rain

330
00:24:04,661 --> 00:24:06,329
waiting for a girl that
you met in a chat room.

331
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:09,293
Oh yeah,
a chat room.

332
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:13,030
Have you actually seen
this girl in person?

333
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:23,077
What are you doing?

334
00:24:23,078 --> 00:24:26,917
You just bailed, and she came
all the way out here to see you.

335
00:24:26,918 --> 00:24:29,386
You're better than
that, Lorenzo.

336
00:24:29,387 --> 00:24:30,721
- Stop the car.
- What?

337
00:24:30,722 --> 00:24:32,513
Just let me out!

338
00:24:49,305 --> 00:24:51,173
What are you
doing here?

339
00:24:51,174 --> 00:24:54,410
I thought we agreed you
wouldn't come over like this.

340
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:57,647
I knew I shouldn't have said
anything to you at that party.

341
00:24:57,648 --> 00:25:06,016
Just so you know, I am not going to break
up with Paul to go out with you again.

342
00:25:06,623 --> 00:25:08,591
- Well, what about...
- Oh no!

343
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:11,763
I am not going to become
one of your poke pals either.

344
00:25:11,764 --> 00:25:13,731
What do you see in this
afterbirth anyway?

345
00:25:13,732 --> 00:25:15,064
You know it's
"born again".

346
00:25:15,065 --> 00:25:19,837
And Paul has goals
and ambitions.

347
00:25:19,838 --> 00:25:22,665
I have those
things too.

348
00:25:22,841 --> 00:25:25,542
Really?

349
00:25:25,543 --> 00:25:30,907
Lorenzo, what do you
wanna do with your life?

350
00:25:31,082 --> 00:25:34,787
I wanna eat like a horse,
drink like a fish, and party...

351
00:25:34,788 --> 00:25:38,690
Party like a rock star.
You always say that.

352
00:25:38,691 --> 00:25:43,224
That's something a 16
year-old would say.

353
00:25:43,928 --> 00:25:50,668
It's like you're eternally and
forever, forever, ever pubescent. Okay?

354
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:54,600
And I just can't be
with somebody like that.

355
00:25:54,907 --> 00:25:58,643
Oh, okay, alright, so the truth
comes out.

356
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:02,615
You broke up with me because... you
think I'm not good enough for you.

357
00:26:02,616 --> 00:26:04,682
No, that's not the truth.

358
00:26:04,683 --> 00:26:09,255
Honestly, I broke up with you
before you could hurt me.

359
00:26:09,256 --> 00:26:15,052
You have to admit, you've
always had a reputation.

360
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:23,534
You know what?
The next time Paul tells you...

361
00:26:23,535 --> 00:26:26,168
how how nice you are or
how beautiful you are,

362
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:27,962
all he's doing is repeating
something a guy with no goals...

363
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:32,403
and a reputation
already told you.

364
00:26:40,821 --> 00:26:47,863
Reputation or not, you were
always a gentleman to me and...

365
00:26:47,864 --> 00:26:54,399
I never said goodbye.
You deserved at least that much.

366
00:26:54,535 --> 00:26:57,795
Goodbye, Lorenzo.

367
00:26:58,372 --> 00:27:01,632
So can I feel
you up?

368
00:27:01,943 --> 00:27:05,203
Fucking idiot.

369
00:27:06,347 --> 00:27:08,981
Guess not.

370
00:27:10,652 --> 00:27:13,189
- A laundromat?
- Fifth Street Suds.

371
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,056
On top of a dryer.

372
00:27:15,057 --> 00:27:18,292
You ever play a game of "hide the
egg roll" with a set of Siamese twins?

373
00:27:18,293 --> 00:27:23,099
What kind of fucked up Ripley's Believe It
or Not backwards country bullshit is that?

374
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,466
I'm sorry. Is that a no?
Drink up.

375
00:27:25,467 --> 00:27:28,736
I know you ain't freaked
a freak of nature.

376
00:27:28,737 --> 00:27:30,927
Not yet.

377
00:27:40,717 --> 00:27:43,654
Damn. Oh sugar!
Daddy be sprung!

378
00:27:43,655 --> 00:27:47,187
Who be calling?

379
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:53,497
Yo! Yo! Yellow Fever Hotline!
This is Jimmy Dog your operator!

380
00:27:53,498 --> 00:27:58,156
Can you hold for
a minute, girl?

381
00:27:59,002 --> 00:28:01,136
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

382
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:04,274
I told you! Don't be bringing
that raspy shit in here!

383
00:28:04,275 --> 00:28:06,744
Tellin' me when and where
we can conversate!

384
00:28:06,745 --> 00:28:08,809
Usin' up all my peak
minutes and shit!

385
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:15,184
Siamese twins.

386
00:28:15,185 --> 00:28:20,224
We ain't on no family plan!
You out of your damn mind!

387
00:28:20,225 --> 00:28:22,653
This isn't a game, Jimmy!

388
00:28:23,727 --> 00:28:29,701
I know it's not. Because with you, I'm
scrimmaging. You see that? That's right!

389
00:28:29,702 --> 00:28:36,568
Gwen and Jimmy are at it again.
Even these don't help.

390
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:41,736
I don't understand why Gwen puts up
with Jimmy's fake-ass ghetto bullshit.

391
00:28:44,282 --> 00:28:46,717
I don't know why
you put up with it.

392
00:28:46,718 --> 00:28:49,054
I'm not a black in America
but for the love of god.

393
00:28:49,055 --> 00:28:51,322
That's right.
You're not black.

394
00:28:51,323 --> 00:28:54,226
Up until now, Jimmy put
the Asian in Caucasian.

395
00:28:54,227 --> 00:28:57,096
I didn't see you get all
riled up about that.

396
00:28:57,097 --> 00:28:58,862
Jimmy's not a
threat to me.

397
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:02,055
It's not like the kid's going to
inject my ass with syphilis.

398
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:05,604
Even if he is having
an identity crisis

399
00:29:05,605 --> 00:29:14,112
I don't understand why Gwen would degrade
herself to put up with a fuck up like him.

400
00:29:14,113 --> 00:29:16,516
I just don't understand
her thought process.

401
00:29:16,517 --> 00:29:19,886
You always want what
you can't have.

402
00:29:19,887 --> 00:29:22,782
Love makes you
dumb like that.

403
00:29:23,589 --> 00:29:25,425
- What now?
- What is wrong with you?

404
00:29:25,426 --> 00:29:27,092
I got nothing
to say to you.

405
00:29:27,093 --> 00:29:29,597
Why don't you sit your ass down
like an Asian girl is supposed to?

406
00:29:29,598 --> 00:29:32,333
- We need to talk now!
- You know what I think about that?

407
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:34,333
- Oh what?
- What's your problem?

408
00:29:34,334 --> 00:29:36,637
After all Gwen does for you,
and this is how you treat her?

409
00:29:36,638 --> 00:29:40,206
You better lean
the fuck back!

410
00:29:40,207 --> 00:29:43,360
Don't be pressing your luck, Jeopardy Boy.
You about to get scrapped!

411
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:46,480
- You're not gonna do anything.
- Hey, it's all right. It's all right.

412
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:49,512
Get this motherfucker off me!

413
00:29:49,816 --> 00:29:51,574
You're a joke.

414
00:29:58,126 --> 00:30:02,455
Fuck you all!
I don't need this shit!

415
00:30:13,873 --> 00:30:22,481
Jimmy, what happened?
Wiill you talk to me? Hello! Jimmy!

416
00:30:25,187 --> 00:30:27,616
What are you doing?
God!

417
00:30:34,463 --> 00:30:37,667
Hey, Sugar Tits.
You order food, you kinky bitch?

418
00:30:37,668 --> 00:30:41,131
Just ignore it, Riles.

419
00:30:41,336 --> 00:30:43,594
Jane!

420
00:30:50,612 --> 00:30:52,871
Jane!

421
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:14,035
You're here late...
again.

422
00:31:14,137 --> 00:31:15,871
Some plans fell through.

423
00:31:15,872 --> 00:31:17,906
And before you can say
anything else, shut up.

424
00:31:17,907 --> 00:31:21,873
Well, I don't have time to talk.
I have to go. What time is it?

425
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,781
Five past midnight.

426
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:27,313
Shit!
There goes my last bus.

427
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:32,355
I can walk you home.

428
00:31:32,356 --> 00:31:34,259
Do you want to carry
my books too?

429
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,426
I'm just saying it's late.

430
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:39,687
A girl walking home alone in the city...
It's not safe.

431
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:09,727
- Hey you!
- Hey.

432
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:13,415
It's cold out here.
How's it going?

433
00:32:13,416 --> 00:32:17,035
It's good.
You just missed the kids.

434
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:19,806
You know, I think it's sweet
what you do for those kids.

435
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:22,974
I bet you'll make a
great dad some day.

436
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:26,711
Personally, I don't think
I could go maternal.

437
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:28,647
Why?

438
00:32:28,648 --> 00:32:31,077
I don't know.

439
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:36,089
Carrying something like this
around for nine months?

440
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:39,747
Like that's ever
coming out of me.

441
00:32:43,197 --> 00:32:44,530
Let's go get some drinks.

442
00:32:44,531 --> 00:32:48,792
There's a new bar in the Mission
that I really want to check out.

443
00:32:51,371 --> 00:32:55,808
- What about page 43?
- Who?

444
00:32:55,809 --> 00:33:00,615
Oh, you mean Riles. Whatever.
He is completely lame.

445
00:33:00,616 --> 00:33:02,512
I would have
never guessed.

446
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:05,040
Do you know what
he said to me?

447
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:09,024
He said that he liked every
muscle in my body

448
00:33:09,025 --> 00:33:12,694
especially his.
Can you believe he said that?

449
00:33:12,695 --> 00:33:14,695
He's classy.

450
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:17,629
What is it with me
and guys, Simon?

451
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:21,194
Is there something
wrong with me?

452
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:30,073
No. There is nothing
wrong with you.

453
00:33:30,712 --> 00:33:35,041
Come console me
over cocktails.

454
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,087
I can't.

455
00:33:40,356 --> 00:33:44,592
I actually have
a date tonight.

456
00:33:44,593 --> 00:33:47,659
Do I know her?

457
00:33:48,097 --> 00:33:52,631
No. You don't.

458
00:33:53,802 --> 00:33:56,026
Okay.

459
00:34:12,622 --> 00:34:14,491
- Simon?
- Hey.

460
00:34:14,492 --> 00:34:16,954
Come in.

461
00:34:17,394 --> 00:34:20,331
Um, Simon, this is
Vivian, my roommate.

462
00:34:20,332 --> 00:34:24,601
Vivian this is Simon,
my lab mate.

463
00:34:24,602 --> 00:34:26,700
Nice to meet you.

464
00:34:27,404 --> 00:34:29,104
The same.

465
00:34:29,105 --> 00:34:32,275
Sorry I didn't call.
I don't have your telephone number.

466
00:34:32,276 --> 00:34:36,412
- Did something happen to my mice?
- No. I don't think so.

467
00:34:37,782 --> 00:34:40,952
I can see you guys are getting
ready to go somewhere.

468
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,252
I'll letyou guys go.

469
00:34:42,253 --> 00:34:43,888
Well, tonight is Ladies Night.

470
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:47,546
Oh. Sounds exclusive.

471
00:34:47,925 --> 00:34:51,061
Well, once a week, we
get together for dinner

472
00:34:51,062 --> 00:34:54,788
and after that we do something
affordably metropolitan.

473
00:34:55,866 --> 00:34:57,834
I actually have a
college buddy.

474
00:34:57,835 --> 00:35:00,839
He and his fiancé have a
Date Night once a week.

475
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,774
They say it keeps their
relationship kindled.

476
00:35:03,775 --> 00:35:09,847
I don't think what we do is
a Date Night, right Vivian?

477
00:35:09,848 --> 00:35:12,573
Oh, right.

478
00:35:16,688 --> 00:35:17,722
Okay.

479
00:35:17,723 --> 00:35:22,328
Actually, you know, Trese, I'm not
really feeling up to it, tonight.

480
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:26,865
- What?
- Hey... Simon.

481
00:35:26,866 --> 00:35:28,468
How do you feel
about Mexican food?

482
00:35:28,469 --> 00:35:30,002
We're compatible.

483
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:33,240
Because Trese here is
dying to try this place.

484
00:35:33,241 --> 00:35:35,307
It's not a life or
death situation.

485
00:35:35,308 --> 00:35:37,744
- I just opened up...
- So Simon, are you in?

486
00:35:37,745 --> 00:35:39,344
...Zagat's.

487
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,179
You don't have to.

488
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,814
But I'd like to.

489
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:48,886
Well, you two
should get going.

490
00:35:48,887 --> 00:35:53,253
I can hear the
dinner stampede.

491
00:36:01,502 --> 00:36:03,464
It was nice
meeting you.

492
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,803
Fuck.

493
00:36:10,444 --> 00:36:13,479
See, this is real
Mexican food.

494
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,318
I went out with this guy from
the Biochemistry Department...

495
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:17,952
for Mexican food once.

496
00:36:17,953 --> 00:36:21,086
He took me to Taco Bell.

497
00:36:21,121 --> 00:36:22,811
Wow.

498
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,960
Yeah.

499
00:36:26,961 --> 00:36:30,459
I can't believe you went out
on a date with a researcher.

500
00:36:30,865 --> 00:36:33,435
Why is that so
unbelievable?

501
00:36:33,436 --> 00:36:35,502
They're socially inept.

502
00:36:35,503 --> 00:36:38,539
I mean, look at the
guys in the lab.

503
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,575
These guys spend every waking
hour in that laboratory

504
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:45,981
working on the same thing over
and over until they get it right.

505
00:36:45,982 --> 00:36:50,218
They're like female
Olympic gymnasts.

506
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:54,184
Eventually they stop growing.
They're stunted.

507
00:36:54,723 --> 00:36:57,152
So you think
I'm stunted.

508
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:02,832
No. You and I are the same.
We're different.

509
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:05,261
You're not like them.

510
00:37:05,835 --> 00:37:09,539
Why do you say "them" when
you talk about the guys in lab?

511
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,839
I mean, aren't
you one of them?

512
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:17,581
No. I go to classes and I work
in a lab, but I'm not like them.

513
00:37:17,582 --> 00:37:22,775
Of course, because you are
the big fish in a small pond.

514
00:37:23,487 --> 00:37:25,756
After all, you are the man.

515
00:37:25,757 --> 00:37:28,617
- What?
- What?

516
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:34,627
I just can't believe we haven't
met you guys before.

517
00:38:34,628 --> 00:38:37,659
I know! We've been
downstairs the whole time!

518
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,791
Simon!

519
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,167
Come here.

520
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:47,674
Simon, this is Hazel
and this is Whitney.

521
00:38:47,675 --> 00:38:50,375
- Hi!
- Hi.

522
00:38:50,376 --> 00:38:52,812
These lovely ladies are
our downstairs neighbors.

523
00:38:52,813 --> 00:38:55,180
Not for long.
Our lease is up at the end of the month

524
00:38:55,181 --> 00:38:59,253
but we couldn't move out without,
like, officially meeting you guys.

525
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,953
Yeah, definitely.

526
00:39:00,954 --> 00:39:04,024
From what we've heard, you
guys definitely seem cool.

527
00:39:04,025 --> 00:39:06,624
- Definitely.
- Really?

528
00:39:07,394 --> 00:39:08,528
Who've you
been talking to?

529
00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:11,097
It's not like someone
came up to us in the hall

530
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:14,534
and was all like, those guys upstairs
are hella cool da-da-da-da-da.

531
00:39:14,535 --> 00:39:20,173
Yeah, I mean we can hear like everything
that goes on in your apartment.

532
00:39:20,174 --> 00:39:23,638
- Everything?
- Everything.

533
00:39:24,745 --> 00:39:29,682
And Simon, that Jane
woman is so wrong for you.

534
00:39:29,683 --> 00:39:32,188
I mean, there are so many
other women out there.

535
00:39:32,189 --> 00:39:34,122
She definitely
doesn't deserve you.

536
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:36,586
Yeah, definitely.

537
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:40,055
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

538
00:39:40,695 --> 00:39:43,625
You said something
about a tour.

539
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:47,034
- So are you gonna give it to me?
- I want it too!

540
00:39:47,035 --> 00:39:53,375
All right, well, I just remembered
I forgot to do something. So yeah...

541
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:56,236
Bye Simon!

542
00:39:58,179 --> 00:40:02,384
Well, this is the
living room and...

543
00:40:02,385 --> 00:40:04,521
...my bedroom is down the hall.
Wanna see it?

544
00:40:04,522 --> 00:40:07,087
- Definitely!
- Definitely!

545
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:12,884
- Ow! My hair is caught!
- Stop moving your head!

546
00:40:17,133 --> 00:40:19,892
- You need to help us.
- Please.

547
00:40:28,077 --> 00:40:30,712
I'll be right back.

548
00:40:35,385 --> 00:40:38,519
- Oh. Hey.
- Hey.

549
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:42,892
Oh, yeah.
Vivian isn't feeling too good.

550
00:40:42,893 --> 00:40:46,597
She's been getting sick
in the mornings lately.

551
00:40:46,598 --> 00:40:50,130
I think she should
take a pregnancy test.

552
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:53,404
Um, so is this a
follow-up visit?

553
00:40:53,405 --> 00:40:56,372
Yeah, I guess
you can say that.

554
00:40:56,373 --> 00:40:58,775
Ok, well, this isn't
a dentist's office

555
00:40:58,776 --> 00:41:02,080
unless coming back here feels
like pulling teeth to you.

556
00:41:02,081 --> 00:41:05,350
No, I was just wondering what
you were doing this afternoon.

557
00:41:05,351 --> 00:41:09,315
Vivian is sick.
I can't leave her alone.

558
00:41:09,687 --> 00:41:14,591
Well, what are you
doing tonight?

559
00:41:14,592 --> 00:41:19,164
I'm performing in a Poetry Slam.
It's the semi-finals.

560
00:41:19,165 --> 00:41:23,664
Oh, I didn't know
you were into that.

561
00:41:24,636 --> 00:41:26,803
Yeah, I'm into it.

562
00:41:30,409 --> 00:41:34,977
You could give your whole
dissertation in haiku.

563
00:41:36,081 --> 00:41:41,452
- A voice. In front of me.
- An idiot emerges.

564
00:41:41,453 --> 00:41:42,820
I'm sorry.

565
00:41:42,821 --> 00:41:45,691
Do you always insult things
that you aren't familiar with?

566
00:41:45,692 --> 00:41:46,757
No.

567
00:41:46,758 --> 00:41:49,862
Look, if you sincerely
want to be edified

568
00:41:49,863 --> 00:41:53,133
show up at 8 at the club
around the corner.

569
00:41:53,134 --> 00:41:56,183
Okay. I will.
I'll show up.

570
00:41:56,184 --> 00:41:59,865
Vivian, I hope
you feel better!

571
00:42:17,824 --> 00:42:21,289
Lock the door
when you leave.

572
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:30,369
Yeah, I know
the routine.

573
00:42:58,934 --> 00:43:04,905
So, like you know,
Lo wanted me to...

574
00:43:04,906 --> 00:43:10,448
I mean, I wanted to apologize...

575
00:43:10,449 --> 00:43:15,950
for how hard I came at you
the other day.

576
00:43:23,259 --> 00:43:31,132
I'm sorry for how hard I
came at you the other day.

577
00:43:31,133 --> 00:43:39,672
I was out of line and
I apologize as well.

578
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:43,881
So we Hindu?
No beef?

579
00:43:43,882 --> 00:43:46,378
None at all.

580
00:43:47,317 --> 00:43:50,508
Yeah, man.
We're cryogenic.

581
00:43:51,889 --> 00:43:56,292
Yes, you are correct.
We are cryogenic.

582
00:43:56,293 --> 00:43:59,595
- There it is! Posse's back!
- Come on, let's celebrate!

583
00:43:59,596 --> 00:44:03,768
This is the Jimmy I like. When you
actually annunciate and speak correctly.

584
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:06,969
What's wrong with my words?
I'm flowing.

585
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:08,540
I got a grill coming in, too,
next week.

586
00:44:08,541 --> 00:44:10,175
I'm gonna put it in my mouth.
I'm gonna be hard.

587
00:44:10,176 --> 00:44:14,346
Call Covonne.
I know exactly where we can go.

588
00:44:14,347 --> 00:44:17,173
Let's get some drinks, yo.

589
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:28,820
A shift of paradigms.
I drop a pair of dimes in the meter.

590
00:44:41,106 --> 00:44:44,775
That's what I'm
talking about!

591
00:44:47,713 --> 00:44:50,779
Oh. Oh. Oh.
Talent. Talent. Talent.

592
00:44:50,983 --> 00:44:53,518
- Trese!
- Hey.

593
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:57,457
Told you I'd be here.
And I broughtyou your new fans.

594
00:44:57,458 --> 00:45:01,394
Jimmy, Lorenzo, Covonne.
Guys. Trese.

595
00:45:01,395 --> 00:45:03,361
- Vivian.
- Vivian.

596
00:45:03,362 --> 00:45:05,549
Hi guys. Thank
you for coming.

597
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:07,666
Los muchachos on
your old block

598
00:45:07,667 --> 00:45:10,603
were probably itchin' for
your quinceañera.

599
00:45:10,604 --> 00:45:15,604
They probably could not
wait for you to come of age.

600
00:45:15,909 --> 00:45:17,911
Excuse me.
Do you have a pen?

601
00:45:17,912 --> 00:45:19,845
Is that your friend?
- No.

602
00:45:19,846 --> 00:45:23,017
- I'm friends with those two.
- I'm on stage next.

603
00:45:23,018 --> 00:45:25,185
So I'll see
you guys later.

604
00:45:25,186 --> 00:45:28,376
- Good luck!
- Adios!

605
00:45:40,468 --> 00:45:46,374
You don't look like you feel well.
Shouldn't you be in bed or something?

606
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:50,478
I've seen every one of Trese's
performances this year.

607
00:45:50,479 --> 00:45:53,715
That's 36 more than
you've been to, bub.

608
00:45:53,716 --> 00:45:57,475
And I'm not about
to miss this one.

609
00:45:59,553 --> 00:46:04,156
- You're a real classy lady.
- You're buying.

610
00:46:12,134 --> 00:46:17,362
This was inspired by
the man at that table.

611
00:46:18,874 --> 00:46:20,563
His name is Jimmy.

612
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:26,468
What? Yeah, because
I got it like that!

613
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:36,491
Having curly hair and yellow skin does not
mean that I don't know my black father.

614
00:46:36,492 --> 00:46:39,799
And just because
I have to get a tan...

615
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,433
doesn't mean that I am
confused about my identity.

616
00:46:43,434 --> 00:46:50,505
So no you are not too "black"
for me. You are just ugly.

617
00:46:50,506 --> 00:46:55,178
And being darker than me doesn't give you
the right to identify my proper identity

618
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:59,817
just because you are uncomfortable
being more negro que la negra.

619
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:03,086
In the city, I am
suddenly Puertoriquena

620
00:47:03,087 --> 00:47:08,426
as beautiful men with
beautiful voices ask me

621
00:47:08,427 --> 00:47:12,898
Eres Boriqua? Brazilena?
Dominicana? Cubana?

622
00:47:12,899 --> 00:47:17,300
So I am sorry if what
you see confuses you.

623
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:19,936
If you do not know how to
put me in the file folder

624
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:24,475
that can be easily shelved in the
census bureau of your brain.

625
00:47:24,476 --> 00:47:27,010
I will not placate you.

626
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:30,932
So include me when you mention
those 7 black people you know.

627
00:47:30,933 --> 00:47:34,785
Because I am not different on
account of you feeling I look so.

628
00:47:34,786 --> 00:47:41,660
Me, an item of mystification, not to be
confused by your bureaucracy of thought.

629
00:47:41,661 --> 00:47:43,527
I am something
higher than race

630
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:47,231
bigger than the color strands of your
hair or the tint in your skin.

631
00:47:47,232 --> 00:47:52,040
I am not multicultural.
I am universal.

632
00:47:52,341 --> 00:47:57,241
And that has nothing to do
with race.

633
00:48:01,147 --> 00:48:03,906
So let's scramble.

634
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:14,615
So why are you
really here?

635
00:48:16,262 --> 00:48:19,233
You know when you question
everything I do, it makes you...

636
00:48:19,234 --> 00:48:21,700
...you're at your
least attractive.

637
00:48:21,701 --> 00:48:25,302
So there are times when
you find me attractive?

638
00:48:29,843 --> 00:48:34,026
Well, you did show up
with a cheering section.

639
00:48:34,027 --> 00:48:38,384
There's something to be
said for accountability.

640
00:48:38,385 --> 00:48:41,956
Are you saying that you
counted on me being here?

641
00:48:41,957 --> 00:48:45,725
No I a-ccounted for
you being here.

642
00:48:45,726 --> 00:48:49,564
Because after I recite this
little number I wrote for you

643
00:48:49,565 --> 00:48:51,900
I will have reached my
quota for the night.

644
00:48:51,901 --> 00:48:53,735
You wrote
me a poem?

645
00:48:53,736 --> 00:48:56,970
"555-3242"

646
00:48:56,971 --> 00:49:02,444
Haiku-d you call me if you
don't have my number? Get it?

647
00:49:02,445 --> 00:49:06,477
Haiku.
I get it.

648
00:49:06,614 --> 00:49:11,580
Well, I have to
take Viv home.

649
00:49:11,919 --> 00:49:15,285
- Do you need some help?
- No, I'm fine.

650
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:19,282
- I love you.
- I love you too, honey.

651
00:49:38,313 --> 00:49:42,065
Hey, so what
do you think?

652
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:46,449
- About what?
- About Trese.

653
00:49:46,623 --> 00:49:49,723
Better not
fuck that up.

654
00:49:57,166 --> 00:50:01,538
Hey Simon. This is Jane.
I guess you're not home yet.

655
00:50:01,539 --> 00:50:05,696
I'll be up for awhile.
Cell me. Bye.

656
00:50:16,787 --> 00:50:21,008
I promise I'll stop treating
you like an experiment.

657
00:50:21,009 --> 00:50:25,161
Lately, I've been treating
guys like experiments

658
00:50:25,162 --> 00:50:30,535
just to prove my hypothesis that all
men have questionable motives.

659
00:50:30,536 --> 00:50:33,905
But I promise I won't treat you
like one of my guinea pigs.

660
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:35,705
Thank you.

661
00:50:35,706 --> 00:50:37,576
So what are you
going to do for me?

662
00:50:37,577 --> 00:50:42,474
Um, let's go
shoe shopping.

663
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,318
I told you that I was going to stop
making generalizations about men

664
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,420
and then you go and
make one about women?

665
00:50:48,421 --> 00:50:52,920
- What're you talking about?
- Ooh.

666
00:50:57,262 --> 00:51:00,965
Whoa! What are you doing?
We got a security deposit.

667
00:51:00,966 --> 00:51:05,338
This is for Jimmy. I was pouring out
some liquor for my fallen partner.

668
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:07,038
What happened to Jimmy?

669
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:10,343
He pulled a 4-9-0
and got locked up.

670
00:51:10,344 --> 00:51:12,577
Shut up.
Jimmy killed somebody?

671
00:51:12,578 --> 00:51:19,183
You need to revisit the teachings
of the good Dr. Dre. That's a 1-8-7.

672
00:51:19,352 --> 00:51:21,435
What's a 4-9-0?

673
00:51:21,436 --> 00:51:23,588
Shoplifting.

674
00:51:23,589 --> 00:51:27,087
Jimmy's boys were barbecuing.
He gaffled some meat.

675
00:52:07,602 --> 00:52:12,363
- Jimmy's an idiot.
- Yeah.

676
00:52:15,076 --> 00:52:17,903
Clean that up!

677
00:52:22,183 --> 00:52:27,981
Jimmy? What happened to you?

678
00:52:28,991 --> 00:52:31,092
Prison has been known
to change a man.

679
00:52:31,093 --> 00:52:33,696
I heard you were in a
holding cell for two hours.

680
00:52:33,697 --> 00:52:36,416
I did a lot of thinking
when I was serving time.

681
00:52:36,417 --> 00:52:39,102
Gwen, you are the best
thing to ever happen to me

682
00:52:39,103 --> 00:52:41,903
but I wanted to
run the streets.

683
00:52:41,904 --> 00:52:44,505
But all I ended up doing
was running the streets.

684
00:52:44,506 --> 00:52:49,245
What makes you think I want anything
to do with a washed up ex-con?

685
00:52:49,246 --> 00:52:52,180
You think a dye job
and a wardrobe change

686
00:52:52,181 --> 00:52:56,186
are going to make up for all
the times you wronged me?

687
00:52:56,187 --> 00:53:00,788
Wait, Gwen. Please.
Just give me a chance.

688
00:53:01,524 --> 00:53:04,161
- Are you really gonna treat me right?
- Yeah.

689
00:53:04,162 --> 00:53:07,529
And I'm your girlfriend.
Not your bitch.

690
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:11,101
Maybe just around the boys, you know,
so they don't think I went soft.

691
00:53:11,102 --> 00:53:13,969
Let's get one thing straight
here, Hamburglar.

692
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:17,339
You're the one standing here
begging me to take you back.

693
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:22,876
Wait a minute. What are you saying?
Now that makes me your...?

694
00:53:25,616 --> 00:53:28,250
Most def.

695
00:53:48,807 --> 00:53:50,841
- Oh my god.
- You are so funny.

696
00:53:50,842 --> 00:53:54,380
If that guy weren't my boss, I'd
throw him down aflight of stairs.

697
00:53:54,381 --> 00:53:57,851
- Where should we go?
- Yo, Gwen!

698
00:53:57,852 --> 00:54:00,737
- Jimmy? This is...
- Stephen.

699
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:03,554
But it's spelled
with a P-H.

700
00:54:03,555 --> 00:54:06,859
There are people who still
mispronounce it and call me Stefan.

701
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:09,328
So I just tell everyone
to call me Steve.

702
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:11,552
It lessens the
complication.

703
00:54:12,597 --> 00:54:19,203
I'm Jimmy.
That's short for Gwen's boyfriend.

704
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:22,073
Stephen is a consultant
with the firm.

705
00:54:22,074 --> 00:54:29,304
And he and I were going to catch a
Happy Hour and discuss a project.

706
00:54:29,582 --> 00:54:33,251
Sounds good.
Where're we going?

707
00:54:34,287 --> 00:54:37,407
Stephen just bought a
building in North Beach.

708
00:54:37,408 --> 00:54:40,285
I dabble in real estate.
It generates income.

709
00:54:40,286 --> 00:54:43,129
Allows me to pursue
my true calling, music.

710
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:45,766
Oh yeah? What's the
name of your band?

711
00:54:45,767 --> 00:54:49,026
The San Francisco Symphony.

712
00:54:53,674 --> 00:54:59,607
Excuse me.
I have to make a "vone" call.

713
00:55:33,448 --> 00:55:37,017
- Hello.
- Anita, it's Lorenzo.

714
00:55:37,018 --> 00:55:40,588
Yeah, you've got
the wrong number.

715
00:55:40,589 --> 00:55:44,193
- He's over there isn't he?
- I think you have the wrong number.

716
00:55:44,194 --> 00:55:48,386
So are you going to do some
Bible thumping tonight?

717
00:55:57,606 --> 00:55:58,706
Hello.

718
00:55:58,707 --> 00:56:03,311
Hey Raylene.
Listen, I'm kinda hungry.

719
00:56:03,312 --> 00:56:06,483
Why don'tyou pick up some
Chinese food and come over?

720
00:56:06,484 --> 00:56:09,310
I can't. My boyfriend's here.

721
00:56:09,552 --> 00:56:15,793
Okay, wait for him fall asleep.
Then come over and tuck me in.

722
00:56:15,794 --> 00:56:20,657
I don't know, Lorenzo.
Just call me some other time.

723
00:57:22,394 --> 00:57:24,663
What are you doing?

724
00:57:24,664 --> 00:57:27,331
- Drive.
- What?

725
00:57:27,332 --> 00:57:31,905
I don't want to drive all the way home.
I just had a little too much to drink.

726
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:34,641
- Get off me!
- Get off me! Just drive.

727
00:57:34,642 --> 00:57:36,575
I'd drive for you.

728
00:57:36,576 --> 00:57:39,179
Great night.
Had a blast.

729
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,232
Hey Lorenzo,
you're awesome.

730
00:57:41,233 --> 00:57:43,250
- Shut up.
- Give me a cigarette.

731
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,383
No!

732
00:58:18,652 --> 00:58:21,556
- Good morning Lorenzo.
- Simon's at the lab.

733
00:58:21,557 --> 00:58:25,454
Doyou want
some cereal?

734
00:58:55,291 --> 00:58:57,959
You want to talk, huh?

735
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,562
And you probably want me to
give you some dirt on Simon.

736
00:59:00,563 --> 00:59:05,131
Not at all. I just want to get to
know my boyfriend's best friend.

737
00:59:05,634 --> 00:59:10,464
I don't want you to know me
as just "Simon's girlfriend".

738
00:59:16,412 --> 00:59:20,017
Okay, maybe I do want
some inside information.

739
00:59:20,018 --> 00:59:23,552
Did Simon ever tell
you he paid for college with...

740
00:59:23,553 --> 00:59:26,891
- the money he won on Teen Jeopardy?
- He never mentioned it.

741
00:59:26,892 --> 00:59:28,491
That's our boy, Simon.

742
00:59:28,492 --> 00:59:31,779
He doesn't like to whip out the big
brain too early in a relationship.

743
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:35,032
Does Simon really think that he'll
scare me off with his intellect?

744
00:59:35,033 --> 00:59:37,635
We attend the same institution.
We're equals.

745
00:59:37,636 --> 00:59:39,632
Yeah, if you
think so.

746
00:59:40,337 --> 00:59:42,271
I can't believe
you just said that.

747
00:59:42,272 --> 00:59:44,807
Women always have the advantage
over men in relationships.

748
00:59:44,808 --> 00:59:47,344
It's up to you if you want to take
it or if you want to get taken.

749
00:59:47,345 --> 00:59:52,749
If Simon is so afraid of chasing women
away with the size of his cranium

750
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:57,318
then why would he display it on national
television for the female populous to see?

751
00:59:58,022 --> 01:00:02,852
He didn't really want to.
It's a long story.

752
01:00:10,334 --> 01:00:14,540
In high school, there was this girl,
Meredith Rolan. Regally blonde.

753
01:00:14,541 --> 01:00:16,974
Her head was underneath
every plastic tiara.

754
01:00:16,975 --> 01:00:21,530
And Simon was royally sprung.
He tutored her after school.

755
01:00:21,531 --> 01:00:26,017
Meredith was dating Neal Culver,
a big timer on campus.

756
01:00:26,018 --> 01:00:28,454
The guy had superstar status
and he didn't even play a sport.

757
01:00:28,455 --> 01:00:30,519
He was in drama?

758
01:00:33,592 --> 01:00:37,261
One day at lunch,
the word's out.

759
01:00:37,262 --> 01:00:39,263
Simon's screwing
around with Meredith.

760
01:00:39,264 --> 01:00:43,870
He's dead. Period. History.
Final period, chemistry.

761
01:00:43,871 --> 01:00:45,806
Everybody knew how
Neal would react.

762
01:00:45,807 --> 01:00:47,873
- Explosively?
- Yeah.

763
01:00:47,874 --> 01:00:50,045
You know how
when you take a bottle,

764
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:52,279
put dry ice in it,
fill it water and cap it...

765
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,450
...carbon dioxide is formed, and the
pressure causes the bottle to...

766
01:00:56,451 --> 01:01:00,587
...blow the hell up. Simon tried to
show me that once in high school.

767
01:01:00,588 --> 01:01:03,323
Like chemistry could be a
blast or something like that.

768
01:01:03,324 --> 01:01:05,691
It didn't really matter.
I still flunked.

769
01:01:05,692 --> 01:01:10,645
You know, that's the one thing
I remember from chemistry.

770
01:01:10,646 --> 01:01:16,102
Anyway, right before the final
bell, Simon's locker blows up.

771
01:01:16,103 --> 01:01:19,673
The cops and bomb squad swoop in
and they evacuated everybody.

772
01:01:19,674 --> 01:01:23,875
They find pieces of plastic and
dry ice from the chemistry lab.

773
01:01:24,378 --> 01:01:27,114
- So there was no fight that day.
- No, not ever.

774
01:01:27,115 --> 01:01:29,817
Simon got kicked out
of school the next day.

775
01:01:29,818 --> 01:01:33,086
Simon was expelled?

776
01:01:33,087 --> 01:01:36,190
The school was in the burbs.
Simon kinda kept to himself.

777
01:01:36,191 --> 01:01:39,128
Maybe he wore a little too
much black. I don't know.

778
01:01:39,129 --> 01:01:41,625
Anyway, he lost
his scholarship.

779
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:46,468
Oh, so that's why he had to go~
on Jeopardy. To pay for college.

780
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:51,127
Yeah, all because I put
that bottle in his locker.

781
01:01:53,208 --> 01:01:55,676
- I don't get it.
- My contents were under pressure!

782
01:01:55,677 --> 01:01:58,743
I was the one screwing around
with Meredith, not Simon.

783
01:01:58,913 --> 01:02:01,752
She told Neal it was Simon
just to cover my ass.

784
01:02:01,753 --> 01:02:03,986
She didn't give a shit about him.

785
01:02:03,987 --> 01:02:07,889
And to this day, I
still haven't told him.

786
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:14,431
I want to. I went over to his
house the first day after school.

787
01:02:14,432 --> 01:02:17,666
And I couldn't do it.

788
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:22,001
And I kept going over
there every day.

789
01:02:22,002 --> 01:02:26,968
I don't know.
We just became best friends.

790
01:02:27,743 --> 01:02:30,809
But you were
just a kid.

791
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:38,484
I've never felt like I've been as good a
friend to Simon as he's been to me.

792
01:02:53,704 --> 01:02:57,396
So, I got a job.

793
01:02:58,008 --> 01:03:02,430
Congratulations! You're a productive
member of society again.

794
01:03:02,431 --> 01:03:06,818
- You can go get your car fixed.
- Actually, I sold the Impala.

795
01:03:06,819 --> 01:03:10,754
But I loved... but
you loved that car.

796
01:03:10,755 --> 01:03:14,359
I needed the money to move
out of the folks' place, you know?

797
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:16,993
Yeah, I guess
that's important.

798
01:03:16,994 --> 01:03:20,464
Paying rent is so fiscally
stupid on so many levels!

799
01:03:20,465 --> 01:03:27,104
You can't afford to buy a place around
here, so what are you going to do?

800
01:03:28,073 --> 01:03:30,942
Well, you're
paying rent.

801
01:03:30,943 --> 01:03:34,680
I don't understand why I have to
pay rent for another apartment

802
01:03:34,681 --> 01:03:37,448
and put my stamp
on the system.

803
01:03:37,449 --> 01:03:40,787
Wait. Are you saying you
want us to live together?

804
01:03:40,788 --> 01:03:44,754
Two economic wrongs
don't make a right.

805
01:03:44,755 --> 01:03:49,352
And besides, I want to
be with you, Gwen.

806
01:03:54,934 --> 01:03:58,728
So what do you say?

807
01:04:11,651 --> 01:04:16,688
- Hi Lorenzo, is Simon here?
- No.

808
01:04:16,689 --> 01:04:20,459
- Do you know where he is?
- No.

809
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:23,254
Okay.

810
01:04:24,431 --> 01:04:27,429
Are you doing anything?

811
01:04:41,015 --> 01:04:48,256
So as a woman, would you ever want
to be with a guy who was aimless?

812
01:04:48,257 --> 01:04:52,259
I'm sure women would
want to be with someone

813
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:56,531
that has some idea of what
he wants do with his life.

814
01:04:56,532 --> 01:05:00,769
I guess there's a reason why
drifters are loners, right?

815
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:04,768
Are you talking about
anyone specific?

816
01:05:05,407 --> 01:05:08,809
I don't know what I want
to do with my life.

817
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:15,107
I don't think you have to
worry about that, you're pretty.

818
01:05:16,017 --> 01:05:18,820
Look, you're young.

819
01:05:18,821 --> 01:05:22,724
And there are a lot of adults who
don't know where they're headed.

820
01:05:22,725 --> 01:05:26,663
That's why they always ask kids, 'What
do you want to be when you grow up?"

821
01:05:26,664 --> 01:05:30,594
It's because they're
looking for ideas.

822
01:05:32,468 --> 01:05:35,804
All right,
it's my turn.

823
01:05:35,805 --> 01:05:39,476
I can tell Simon really cares
about what you think.

824
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:43,530
So what do you
think about me?

825
01:05:43,531 --> 01:05:47,551
I can see you
growing on me.

826
01:05:47,552 --> 01:05:50,185
Whoopee.

827
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:04,969
- Thanks for the company. It was fun.
- Yeah, sure.

828
01:06:04,970 --> 01:06:07,204
Simon, are you there?

829
01:06:07,205 --> 01:06:10,273
- Hey.
- Hey.

830
01:06:10,274 --> 01:06:16,277
- Did you kids have a good time?
- Yeah, it was great.

831
01:07:02,394 --> 01:07:06,965
Hey, it's after 12!

832
01:07:06,966 --> 01:07:10,659
Dinner shift doesn't
start till 6.

833
01:07:11,071 --> 01:07:13,906
Don't you have somewhere
you need to be?

834
01:07:13,907 --> 01:07:20,112
The only thing I have to do today is
remember every detail from last night

835
01:07:20,113 --> 01:07:26,954
and write it all down in my blog, so the
whole world wide web can read about it.

836
01:07:26,955 --> 01:07:31,429
I don't think
there's an emoticon.

837
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:36,464
or smiley that describes
how I feel.

838
01:07:36,465 --> 01:07:42,837
Oh, I forgot your name.
I can't remember anything.

839
01:07:42,838 --> 01:07:45,937
I think you came
in my brain.

840
01:07:46,007 --> 01:07:49,767
Simon, it's Jane. Where are you?

841
01:07:50,244 --> 01:07:52,512
Lorenzo.

842
01:07:52,513 --> 01:07:55,285
You know how you're
always saying the best way...

843
01:07:55,286 --> 01:07:58,019
to get a girl to want you
is to be inaccessible?

844
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:02,655
- That could not be more true.
- Yeah, Lo knows hoes.

845
01:08:02,656 --> 01:08:07,263
I mean, Jane never called
before I started seeing Trese.

846
01:08:07,264 --> 01:08:10,022
Did you say Jane?

847
01:08:12,601 --> 01:08:16,003
I think she really
misses me.

848
01:08:16,004 --> 01:08:19,341
Yeah, Simon, you win.
All right, let it go.

849
01:08:19,342 --> 01:08:21,075
Oh wait!

850
01:08:21,076 --> 01:08:23,539
Are you going
to call her?

851
01:08:24,146 --> 01:08:26,914
Yeah.
It's my turn to do the mistreating.

852
01:08:26,915 --> 01:08:32,320
This is Jane we're talking about here.
She loves messing with guys' heads.

853
01:08:32,321 --> 01:08:34,079
I got this.

854
01:08:35,024 --> 01:08:36,691
Simon!

855
01:08:38,194 --> 01:08:42,887
Look, just be
careful, all right?

856
01:08:49,906 --> 01:08:56,340
Jane, it's Simon.
Hey!

857
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:08,324
Now what are you
working on again?

858
01:09:08,325 --> 01:09:11,397
I know you've explained it to me
like 10 times already,

859
01:09:11,398 --> 01:09:13,631
but you know I'm a boob top.

860
01:09:13,632 --> 01:09:15,967
- Explain it to me one more time. Please.
- Okay.

861
01:09:15,968 --> 01:09:19,235
I'll usevisuals
this time.

862
01:09:19,236 --> 01:09:25,209
Okay, I've constructed a protein
that can bind itself to cancer cells.

863
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:30,814
Let's say this is the tumor,
and this is the protein.

864
01:09:30,815 --> 01:09:35,470
This protein has another part
to it that attacks the cancer.

865
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:39,333
But it only works if the protein
is attached to the tumor.

866
01:09:39,334 --> 01:09:43,127
That way all the normal cells
around it are unaffected.

867
01:09:43,128 --> 01:09:48,867
It's a viable alternative to radiation and
chemotherapy. It's extremely exciting!

868
01:09:48,868 --> 01:09:53,071
Or not. I lost you again.
Didn't I?

869
01:09:53,072 --> 01:09:58,111
Oh no, you didn't lose me.
Okay look, here's the tumor...

870
01:09:58,112 --> 01:10:02,882
Oh! Okay. All right.
No, that's okay.

871
01:10:02,883 --> 01:10:07,006
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

872
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:20,730
Hey, I left a key under the mat.
Meet me in 30 minutes, okay?

873
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:32,705
Shit.

874
01:10:41,888 --> 01:10:44,818
Good night.

875
01:11:27,402 --> 01:11:32,334
I can't letyou do this
to Simon anymore.

876
01:11:33,342 --> 01:11:39,480
You can't let me do this?
I'm not doing this by myself.

877
01:11:40,349 --> 01:11:47,357
What's so funny?
- I've just never seen you so moralistic.

878
01:11:47,358 --> 01:11:50,592
When did that happen?

879
01:11:50,593 --> 01:11:53,599
I'm sure all the girls
that you've done and ditched...

880
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,533
would probably wanna know
the same thing.

881
01:11:56,534 --> 01:11:59,759
Let him go.

882
01:12:01,771 --> 01:12:05,507
If you want me to
break Simon's heart

883
01:12:05,508 --> 01:12:12,910
I can just tell him that his best friend
is fucking the woman he loves.

884
01:12:13,484 --> 01:12:17,085
I'm sure that
would do it.

885
01:12:38,543 --> 01:12:43,982
Gwen said you just got out of jail.
- Did you get any tats?

886
01:12:43,983 --> 01:12:48,243
I was only incarcerated
for a little while.

887
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:55,592
Well, what were you in for?
- Um, I stole some meat.

888
01:12:55,593 --> 01:12:58,022
Oh.

889
01:13:09,909 --> 01:13:13,635
Let's watch
the movie.

890
01:13:14,947 --> 01:13:18,017
Oh, so you never told
me how that date went.

891
01:13:18,018 --> 01:13:23,586
Oh yeah.
Well, it's going good.

892
01:13:24,623 --> 01:13:27,291
So it's serious?

893
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:30,830
I guess.
I don't know.

894
01:13:30,831 --> 01:13:35,695
- Wow.
- Yeah.

895
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:40,037
I envy you, Simon.

896
01:13:41,741 --> 01:13:50,351
I mean, seeing someone
somewhat seriously is special.

897
01:13:50,352 --> 01:13:53,008
Yeah.

898
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:57,458
I've never really told you
how much I appreciate you.

899
01:13:57,459 --> 01:14:01,361
I mean, I know I'm
high-maintenance.

900
01:14:01,362 --> 01:14:10,005
But you should know all those times
that you went out of your way for me...

901
01:14:10,006 --> 01:14:15,131
...they haven't
gone unnoticed.

902
01:14:17,111 --> 01:14:21,081
It was no big deal.

903
01:14:21,082 --> 01:14:24,808
Thank you, Simon.

904
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:23,111
Jimmy!

905
01:15:23,112 --> 01:15:25,181
In the kitchen!

906
01:15:25,182 --> 01:15:29,454
Jimmy, did you clean?
You're cooking?

907
01:15:29,455 --> 01:15:34,318
- Yup.
- Is that nuoc mam?

908
01:15:34,959 --> 01:15:38,787
It's amazing whatyou can do
with fish sauce. Come on. Here.

909
01:15:42,733 --> 01:15:45,424
Is something wrong?

910
01:15:48,706 --> 01:15:50,786
I'm really not sure
how to say this.

911
01:15:50,787 --> 01:15:53,410
It's okay, honey.
Just spit it out.

912
01:15:53,411 --> 01:15:56,238
Okay, Jimmy.
You're a pussy.

913
01:15:56,815 --> 01:16:00,317
What? I thought this
is whatyou wanted.

914
01:16:00,318 --> 01:16:05,682
You're losing your sense of manliness,
and it's turning me off.

915
01:16:24,410 --> 01:16:28,148
- What the hell did you just do that for?
- Because you don't need it!

916
01:16:28,149 --> 01:16:31,816
I mean, the way you were sucking
up to Stephen's trashtalking

917
01:16:31,817 --> 01:16:35,288
you might as well slap a bag on your
ass and crawl around on the floor

918
01:16:35,289 --> 01:16:37,155
because you were all lips
and lungs back at the bar.

919
01:16:37,156 --> 01:16:40,327
Jimmy please! The only reason I did
that was to get your ass in gear

920
01:16:40,328 --> 01:16:44,230
- and to get you to do something!
- I did do something!

921
01:16:44,231 --> 01:16:47,701
But I mean...

922
01:16:47,702 --> 01:16:51,802
I can change.

923
01:16:52,439 --> 01:16:58,509
I can buy you a new vacuum cleaner.
Whatever you want.

924
01:16:59,613 --> 01:17:02,982
It's too late, Jimmy.

925
01:17:02,983 --> 01:17:07,016
I don't even get off when
I'm on top anymore.

926
01:17:46,562 --> 01:17:49,631
He'll be here.

927
01:17:49,632 --> 01:17:51,666
Hey babe. It's Jane.

928
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,703
Listen, there's something
I need to tell you...

929
01:17:53,704 --> 01:17:55,819
and I don't want to
do it over the phone.

930
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:58,566
Can you please come
over for dinner tonight?

931
01:18:14,824 --> 01:18:19,210
I wrote this with
someone in mind.

932
01:18:19,211 --> 01:18:24,229
That person is
not here tonight.

933
01:18:27,470 --> 01:18:31,311
"I fear that you may
forget sometimes,

934
01:18:31,312 --> 01:18:35,345
'cause I let you see me cry
how tough I am".

935
01:18:35,346 --> 01:18:40,850
"The strength I hold.
The power deep inside".

936
01:18:40,851 --> 01:18:47,325
"If in your presence these eyes tear
If you feel emotion here"

937
01:18:47,326 --> 01:18:49,826
"Consider yourself blessed".

938
01:18:49,827 --> 01:18:56,932
"It means you're liked and trusted.
It means you're better than the rest".

939
01:18:57,068 --> 01:19:00,605
The other night when you told
meyou were seeing someone

940
01:19:00,606 --> 01:19:03,873
you looked so happy.

941
01:19:03,874 --> 01:19:08,547
And I did something I told
myself I would never do.

942
01:19:08,548 --> 01:19:12,850
But it was so unexpected.

943
01:19:12,851 --> 01:19:18,424
I just couldn't understand
why I didn't do it sooner.

944
01:19:18,425 --> 01:19:21,994
That's why I wanted
to tell you that I...

945
01:19:21,995 --> 01:19:24,924
Don't move.

946
01:19:27,899 --> 01:19:29,980
Yeah, come on up.

947
01:19:29,981 --> 01:19:32,694
The food's here.

948
01:19:36,709 --> 01:19:41,148
"Even when I'm gentle, falling like a
leaf into your out-stretched arms".

949
01:19:41,149 --> 01:19:46,451
"On to your shoulders weep.
You will remember".

950
01:19:46,452 --> 01:19:50,952
Hey! Perfect timing.

951
01:19:51,758 --> 01:19:57,418
Simon, this is Max.

952
01:20:06,673 --> 01:20:13,713
Hey, it's nice to
meetyou, Simon.

953
01:20:13,714 --> 01:20:18,578
I decided to call Max.
That's what I wanted to tell you.

954
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:29,398
"You must remember to call me by my
true name. I am a strong woman".

955
01:20:29,499 --> 01:20:35,337
"Artemis. Shakti. Tower of fists.
Stone gaze. Medusa".

956
01:20:35,338 --> 01:20:39,340
"Kali is my right hand".

957
01:20:39,341 --> 01:20:43,974
"I am a bad ass bitch".

958
01:20:53,655 --> 01:20:55,414
You were great.

959
01:21:04,266 --> 01:21:08,404
Can I get a glass of
white wine, please?

960
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:12,207
- Lorenzo?
- Hey.

961
01:21:12,208 --> 01:21:16,444
- And so out of the blue, Jane calls
me and says she wants me back.

962
01:21:16,445 --> 01:21:19,184
I mean, yeah,
I was seeing some other chick,

963
01:21:19,185 --> 01:21:21,918
but when Jane called,
it was a no-brainer.

964
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:24,620
I mean, look at her.

965
01:21:24,621 --> 01:21:29,519
I understand your
thought process.

966
01:21:32,696 --> 01:21:37,457
So Simon, how doyou know Jane?

967
01:21:41,171 --> 01:21:43,806
We're friends.

968
01:21:43,807 --> 01:21:46,498
And Simon is so smart.

969
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:50,313
He's a scientist.

970
01:21:50,314 --> 01:21:54,450
Oh, do that thing
with the tumor.

971
01:22:00,691 --> 01:22:02,594
- Where's Simon?
- He's not here?

972
01:22:02,595 --> 01:22:04,761
He didn't show up.

973
01:22:04,762 --> 01:22:09,330
He's probably stuck somewhere.
I'm sure he feels awful.

974
01:22:10,034 --> 01:22:13,338
What's the matter, Simon?

975
01:22:13,339 --> 01:22:16,573
Isyour stomach churning?

976
01:22:16,574 --> 01:22:22,474
Doyou have this empty feeling
in the pit ofyour stomach?

977
01:22:23,582 --> 01:22:28,742
Maybe the pain is just a little higher up.

978
01:22:28,854 --> 01:22:34,794
- Is your heart burning?
- Babe, I think you mean heartburn.

979
01:22:34,795 --> 01:22:37,792
Yeah, that's
what I meant.

980
01:22:50,843 --> 01:22:53,378
What's his problem?

981
01:22:53,379 --> 01:22:58,778
- He didn't stand a chance.
- Now it's just us.

982
01:22:59,185 --> 01:23:02,877
Don't fucking touch me!

983
01:23:04,057 --> 01:23:08,829
I bet Simon feels awful.
But how do you feel?

984
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:11,029
What do you mean?

985
01:23:11,030 --> 01:23:14,502
You know what
I mean, Lorenzo.

986
01:23:14,503 --> 01:23:18,069
But I know
how you feel.

987
01:23:18,372 --> 01:23:22,940
Trust me, I know
how you feel.

988
01:24:03,385 --> 01:24:07,054
I knew that poetry
wasn't your thing, and I guess...

989
01:24:07,055 --> 01:24:10,689
maybe being with me
wasn't your thing either.

990
01:24:10,690 --> 01:24:14,224
But come back to the lab.
That is your thing.

991
01:24:14,225 --> 01:24:18,625
Don't let me get in the way of that.
Good bye, Simon.

992
01:24:19,001 --> 01:24:22,192
You're fucking up,
aren'tyou?

993
01:24:25,374 --> 01:24:27,541
Not now, Lorenzo.

994
01:24:28,444 --> 01:24:30,879
It's Jane, isn't it?
I told you forget her.

995
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,980
That made me want her more.

996
01:24:34,083 --> 01:24:38,956
You don't think I knew what every guy
was thinking when I was out with her.

997
01:24:38,957 --> 01:24:41,783
'What the fuck is she
doing with him?"

998
01:24:42,125 --> 01:24:45,692
In a sense, you were saying
the same thing.

999
01:24:46,530 --> 01:24:49,448
You were so sure that Jane
was going to hurt me

1000
01:24:49,449 --> 01:24:52,998
because you didn't think
I was good enough for her.

1001
01:24:54,104 --> 01:24:58,476
That's why I wanted to prove
to myself, and to you

1002
01:24:58,477 --> 01:25:01,696
and to every other
motherfucker out there

1003
01:25:01,697 --> 01:25:04,883
that the good guy
could get the girl.

1004
01:25:04,884 --> 01:25:08,051
Because I deserved to.

1005
01:25:08,052 --> 01:25:11,289
Being the good guy never
entitled you to shit.

1006
01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:13,191
Plus, you got the girl.
You got Trese.

1007
01:25:13,192 --> 01:25:15,625
I loved Jane!

1008
01:25:15,626 --> 01:25:19,022
Oh, so you endured
all this shit for love.

1009
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:22,899
Yes.

1010
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:26,404
God, you weren't even in
love, you masochistic fuck.

1011
01:25:26,405 --> 01:25:27,904
You loved the pain.

1012
01:25:27,905 --> 01:25:30,610
It made you feel good to think
you were the good guy.

1013
01:25:30,611 --> 01:25:32,543
But how good a guy have you been?
Really?

1014
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:35,248
Stringing Trese along so
you can get in Jane's head.

1015
01:25:35,249 --> 01:25:37,882
Like I said,
you fucked up.

1016
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:44,624
You want to know what's fucked up?
Hearing you talk about love.

1017
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:49,762
You've got your dick in every
fucking hole in this city.

1018
01:25:49,763 --> 01:25:53,192
How do you know
anything about love?

1019
01:25:54,600 --> 01:26:00,807
But I guess all your escapades
did allow you some insight.

1020
01:26:00,808 --> 01:26:03,308
You called it right with Jane.
Didn't you?

1021
01:26:03,309 --> 01:26:06,611
Yeah, well, I probably didn't need
to sleep with Jane...

1022
01:26:06,612 --> 01:26:09,312
to get a read on her, did I?

1023
01:26:18,224 --> 01:26:23,884
How long?

1024
01:26:24,297 --> 01:26:27,091
Past four months.

1025
01:26:27,468 --> 01:26:30,534
Past four months.

1026
01:26:32,740 --> 01:26:39,112
Well, I guess that's why you
wanted me to get over Jane.

1027
01:26:39,113 --> 01:26:43,146
That way you could
fuck her guilt free.

1028
01:26:43,350 --> 01:26:46,853
You never grew up, Lorenzo.

1029
01:26:46,854 --> 01:26:51,292
You're the same fucking guy
you were in high school.

1030
01:26:51,293 --> 01:26:56,331
Oh and guess what?
I knew about Meredith Rolan.

1031
01:26:56,532 --> 01:27:05,139
But see, up until
this moment

1032
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:12,245
I thought I could use
any friend I could get.

1033
01:27:16,918 --> 01:27:19,677
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck you.

1034
01:27:20,155 --> 01:27:22,847
Fuck you.

1035
01:27:49,052 --> 01:27:54,625
Trese, he's back. I knew he'd be back.
Men are so predictable.

1036
01:27:54,626 --> 01:27:57,928
- Lorenzo?
- It's for you.

1037
01:27:57,929 --> 01:27:59,812
What is this?

1038
01:27:59,813 --> 01:28:02,327
Can we talk?

1039
01:28:02,766 --> 01:28:05,263
Yeah.

1040
01:28:31,229 --> 01:28:34,864
Vivian, keys.

1041
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:05,259
I didn't know
you smoked.

1042
01:29:07,866 --> 01:29:11,127
Read it.

1043
01:29:15,775 --> 01:29:18,340
Out loud.

1044
01:29:20,013 --> 01:29:22,718
"You just know.
The first time you sit in a kitchen...

1045
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:25,052
across from her
and her eyes twinkle"

1046
01:29:25,053 --> 01:29:29,423
"and her voice and thoughts force their
way through your heart. You just know".

1047
01:29:29,424 --> 01:29:34,393
"That one hour with her is
like a day with anyone else".

1048
01:29:34,394 --> 01:29:41,002
"You just know that she could have given
you everything if only you had let her".

1049
01:29:41,003 --> 01:29:46,840
"You just know that meeting her
allowed you not to settle for less"

1050
01:29:46,841 --> 01:29:49,613
"and that if you keep o
being yourself...

1051
01:29:49,614 --> 01:29:52,247
there will be someone
who will eclipse her".

1052
01:29:52,248 --> 01:29:57,786
"Or at least that's what you
keep telling yourself".

1053
01:29:57,787 --> 01:30:02,252
Lorenzo gave it to me.

1054
01:30:03,457 --> 01:30:08,229
I didn't think a guy
with heart existed.

1055
01:30:08,230 --> 01:30:12,233
But the man that
wrote this has heart.

1056
01:30:12,234 --> 01:30:15,994
That's all I ever wanted.

1057
01:30:19,107 --> 01:30:25,047
You came all the way here to tell me you
want to be with the guy that wrote this?

1058
01:30:25,048 --> 01:30:27,704
Yes.

1059
01:30:47,437 --> 01:30:51,172
Yup.
- I'm lonely.

1060
01:30:51,173 --> 01:30:55,539
It's a bitch, ain't it?

1061
01:31:08,358 --> 01:31:11,959
We're lost,
aren't we?

1062
01:31:14,465 --> 01:31:18,002
Listen, I really think we should've asked
that guy back there for directions.

1063
01:31:18,003 --> 01:31:20,037
Crackheads have no
sense of direction.

1064
01:31:20,038 --> 01:31:22,839
Plus we're not lost.

1065
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:26,709
How do you know he's
addicted to crack cocaine?

1066
01:31:26,710 --> 01:31:32,249
Okay, forget that. How do you
know where we're going?

1067
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:35,248
Follow the beat.

1068
01:33:04,612 --> 01:33:07,974
Look in my eyes. Eye contact.
