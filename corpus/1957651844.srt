It's supposed to be a prank.

00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,625
Right. But, like,
it happens every year, so...

21
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:21,875

school-sanctioned, right?

they could,

- [Auden] Yes.

503
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:08,375
- Okay.
- I have.

504
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:09,583
Yeah, how sick.

505
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:13,125
- [Eli] Did you go to prom?
- [Auden] No.

506
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:14,708
[Eli] Why not?

507
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:19,125
I guess I'm just not one of those people
who thought high school is supposed to be

508
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,958
this, like, big party.

509
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:25,375
I was more interested in working hard
so the rest of my life could be great.

510
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:29,833
Okay, but come on. I mean, even the kids
who hate high school still go to prom,

511
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:34,583
unless, uh, you're too cool for it,
which is the vibe I'm getting from you.

512
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,750
It's not that.

513
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:39,291
[chuckles] It's, I guess,
um, I got stood up.

514
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:43,333
Oh God. I'm sorry. That's terrible.

515
00:30:43,416 --> 00:30:45,833
No. Oh my God. Please don't feel bad.

516
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:49,875
I was supposed to go with this guy, Jason.
He was just like a lab partner.

517
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:51,166
It was a friends' thing.

518
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,333
And... Well, he got invited
to a conference at Duke, so...

519
00:30:54,416 --> 00:30:58,458
It was, like, so not a big deal.
I couldn't care less about prom.

520
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:00,875
[Eli] Huh.

521
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:03,666
Really? Are you sure?

522
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,625
Okay, fine. Uh, maybe the one thing
that sucked a little was the dress.

523
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:11,458
- The dress?
- Yeah.

524
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:14,375
I was downtown one day,
going to used bookstores,

525
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:16,416
and I wandered into this store,

526
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,000
and there was this dress on a mannequin
that was just, like, so cool.

527
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:22,541
Um... [chuckles]

528
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:27,791
You know, if I regret anything,
it's not being able to wear the dress.

529
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:32,666
But prom itself? Yeah, pass.

530
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,250
Did you bring it to Colby with you?

531
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:36,875
No.

532
00:31:37,916 --> 00:31:38,791
No?

533
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:41,041
Where would I wear
something like that here?

534
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:42,750
[chuckles] Anywhere.

535
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:44,666
What?

536
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:47,791
Yeah, wear it to, uh, skip rocks.

537
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:49,125
Wear it to drink Cokes.

538
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:52,250
I mean, it doesn't matter
where you wear it

539
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,083
if it's about the dress, right?

540
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:56,083
I guess.

541
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:57,958
[Eli] Hmm.

542
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:01,500
You know, it's a shame
you didn't bring that dress

543
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:04,500
because it would have been
perfect for the quest.

544
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:06,416
Eli, we're not doing the quest.

545
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,000
[chuckles] Oh, Auden. Of course we are.

546
00:32:11,958 --> 00:32:15,291
What about you? We've been talking
about me this whole time.

547
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:18,708
[Eli] Yeah, well, that's because
you're a lot more interesting than I am.

548
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:20,916
Stop deflecting. Your turn.

549
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:22,791
[Eli sighs]

550
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:26,458
I don't know. Sometimes I feel
like all I've ever done is goof off.

551
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,291
I even made a career out of it.

552
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:32,083
- I mean, for a minute.
- How'd you do that?

553
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:36,208
Just, uh, bike stuff. Whatever.

554
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:40,916
You know, now it's like,
what does it all add up to?

555
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,958
Just, uh, some grainy clips on YouTube?
Bunch of stupid stories?

556
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:51,833
I think that everyone deserves
a do-over if they want it.

557
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:54,750
You know? Wish I could have a do-over.

558
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,416
A do-over for what?

559
00:33:01,541 --> 00:33:02,583
[Eli clears throat]

560
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You, uh...

561
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:09,333
You didn't win,
but it's a very respectable performance,

562
00:33:09,416 --> 00:33:10,500
I will say.

563
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,833
Can I keep it?

564
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:18,583
Just in case anyone ever asks
if I've played mini-golf,

565
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:20,375
it'd be good to have proof.

566
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,583
'Course. Yeah, gotta have proof.

567
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:27,083
[melodic organ music playing]

568
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:58,291
I hate when it rains.

569
00:33:58,375 --> 00:34:01,333
- Can't be a beach day every day.
- Why not?

570
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:02,875
I'll go get the ponchos.

571
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:08,958
- [thunder rumbling]
- [knocking at door]

572
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:13,250
- Sorry, the ponchos are back here.
- Oh. I can get them.

573
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:21,583
Oh my God. These are awful.

574
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:25,625
[Maggie] When you say stuff like that,
you act like you're speaking for everyone,

575
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:28,041
when really,
you're only speaking for yourself.

576
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,208
Oh, I...

577
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:31,416
Um...

578
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,666
You're right. Sorry.

579
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:36,208
[Leah] Auden, you have a visitor.

580
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:41,041
[box thuds]

581
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,166
Mom. Hi.

582
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,625
Auden. Hello. [chuckles]

583
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:49,333
[mother sighs]

584
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:54,750
Can we help you find something?

585
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:58,916
I'm gonna wait for you outside.

586
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:02,125
[chuckles]

587
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:05,541
Here.

588
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:09,958
I know what you're gonna say,
but come on, you'll get soaked.

589
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,041
Thanks.

590
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:21,750
[boys indistinctly chattering]

591
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,750
Have you sampled the local cuisine?

592
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,791
- What?
- Where would you like to have lunch?

593
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,541
Um, there's a place on the boardwalk
with good onion rings.

594
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:38,958
How charming.

595
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,250
[soft piano music playing]

596
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:47,666
So,

597
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:51,750
how's it going? Bonding with your father?

598
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Good.

599
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:56,041
I mean, he's kind of busy.

600
00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:58,583
He's just working really hard.

601
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:04,583
The thing about your father is, uh,
he enjoys the performance of working

602
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:07,750
arguably more than he does
the actual work.

603
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
And Heidi?

604
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:11,750
Heidi's nice.

605
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:13,208
Of course she's nice.

606
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:15,791
Women like her are always nice.

607
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:18,791
They have to be.
It's part of the job description. [laughs]

608
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:23,708
Poor thing. She must be exhausted,
caring for the infant all by herself.

609
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:24,791
Dad helps.

610
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:29,208
Auden, who do you think you're talking to?

611
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:32,083
[mother chuckles]

612
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:34,416
Ah.

613
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:38,375
Oh! That's quite the raincoat.

614
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:40,958
- [laughs]
- Okay. Just say it, Mom.

615
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:41,916
Say what?

616
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,833
Whatever it is you wanna say.

617
00:36:43,916 --> 00:36:45,000
[sighs]

618
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:49,041
You'll have to forgive me
if I find it alarming

619
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:52,916
how easily you've adapted to the world
of your father's new wife.

620
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,083
That's insane. I'm... I'm exactly the same
as I've always been.

621
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:01,250
Look, sweetheart. I realize
that you're doing soul-searching,

622
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:03,750
and that's fine. It's normal, even.

623
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:07,250
Just don't let this little break
from reality come at a cost.

624
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:13,875
Your classmates from Defriese
are not spending the summer hawking thongs

625
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:16,208
and doing keg stands.

626
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:19,041
I'm not doing keg stands, Mom.

627
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:21,750
We'll see.

628
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:25,583
- [seagulls squawking]
- [ocean waves crashing]

629
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:30,291
[Maggie] Hey.

630
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:32,541
Maggie, hi.

631
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:36,500
Your mom's kind of intense, huh?

632
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:39,208
Yeah, you could say that.

633
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:44,833
She's a legend as a professor,
but it must be hard to be her daughter.

634
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:47,666
You know who my mom is?

635
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:51,375
Of course. I almost went to the U
just so I could take her classes.

636
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:54,291
But I couldn't turn down Defriese.

637
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:56,000
You're going to Defriese?

638
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,250
I'm going to Defriese.

639
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:01,083
[chuckles] I know. Heidi told me.

640
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:05,041
I'm starting to understand why,

641
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:07,708
when you saw me,
you thought, "Wow, I hate her."

642
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,125
Actually, when I first saw you, I thought,

643
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:14,791
"I'm so depressed that cool, hot girl's
hooking up with my boyfriend."

644
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:18,291
- Yeah.
- I didn't form an opinion until later.

645
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:20,875
[both laughing]

646
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,083
Fair. That is fair.

647
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:28,750
But what wasn't fair was being
so hard on you about the Jake stuff.

648
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,333
I mean, you didn't even know me.

649
00:38:31,416 --> 00:38:33,791
Yeah, but I still feel bad.

650
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:36,541
It's okay. He's a tool.

651
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,208
I'm not gonna say anything.

652
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:42,291
[Maggie laughs] It's okay.
I've come to accept it.

653
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:46,416
But at least he's, you know, a hot one.

654
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,500
[both laughing]

655
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:52,000
I'll give you that. He's... he's a hot tool.

656
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:53,083
[both laughing]

657
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:57,041
Okay, come on.
I promised Heidi I would show you around,

658
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:59,708
and I've been delinquent
with my responsibilities.

659
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,833
Esther and Leah are sitting up there
if you wanna head over.

660
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:05,833
- Where are you going?
- I'll be up in a bit.

661
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:08,458
- Hey.
- [Auden] Hey.

662
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,666
She roped you into this too?

663
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:13,208
No worse than
when you roped us into going to Ossify

664
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:15,875
to watch that guy recite
his shopping list over a drumbeat.

665
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:17,750
Why did Maggie wanna come here?

666
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:18,875
Why do you think?

667
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:21,125
Is she into one of those guys?

668
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,250
[Esther] You'll see.

669
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:25,500
Wait, what?

670
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:28,833
What's happening?

671
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:32,333
This... this is a joke.
You guys are playing a joke on me.

672
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:34,625

Guess that's why we're pals.

00:48:33,291 --> 00:48:36,083
But seriously, why don't you sleep?

848
00:48:37,458 --> 00:48:39,916
I'm just a night owl, I guess, you know?

849
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,666
What about you? Same question.

850
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:42,833
Same answer.

851
00:48:43,708 --> 00:48:45,791
Nocturne, night owl.

852
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:50,833
Nah. You have a story. I can tell.

853
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,750
If I had to pull it down,

854
00:48:58,708 --> 00:49:02,083
I guess it's
that when my parents were still married,

855
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:06,000
they used to wait for me to fall asleep
before they would start fighting.

856
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:12,708
And I thought if I didn't fall asleep,
they can't fight.

857
00:49:14,166 --> 00:49:16,166
I mean, I was wrong, obviously.

858
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:18,958
I'm sorry. That's...

859
00:49:19,041 --> 00:49:20,833
No, please don't be.

860
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:24,666
I'm not like one of those kids
who's defined by her parents' divorce.

861
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:28,333
If anything, my life was probably better
because they got divorced.

862
00:49:28,916 --> 00:49:30,750
Whose parents are still married anyway?

863
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:32,458
Mine are.

864
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:33,958
Right.

she just wants the boob. [chuckles]

All right.

904
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:15,375
[Auden] Do you think it's okay
we left just like that?

905
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:17,916
Heidi seemed a little, like, strung out.

906
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,250
No, she's fine. I think that's
just what new motherhood looks like.

907
00:51:21,333 --> 00:51:23,000
Was it like that for you and Mom?

908

No, your... your mother
and Heidi are completely different.

As far as I can tell,
all women go nuts with a newborn.

But men don't?

911
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:34,958
I think that's why she's frustrated
about the book.

912
00:51:36,958 --> 00:51:39,833
It's like I told her
when she said she wanted to get pregnant.

I only have these three months

a lot of my work deals with

undiscovered trauma
that we carry from our parents.

920
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:02,750
Auden, you're so lucky you don't have
that to deal with, at least not from me.

921
00:52:03,875 --> 00:52:04,916
Right.

Yeah, it'd be great to have
a young person's perspective.

Of course. I carry it with me everywhere.

Yeah. I mean, of course. I'd love to, Dad.

that would be really great.

so excited to have him trust me with it,

absolutely no desire to read this.

Wallace's parents go out of town
every year on the Fourth,

1067
01:01:05,041 --> 01:01:06,500
and we take over their house.

1068

We didn't come up with the name,
which I'll grant you is terrible.

The name doesn't matter.
What matters is you showing up with Eli

so that, as your friends,
we can assess the situation.

friends like this before.

I mean, there were people at our school
way more awkward than you,

1075
01:01:31,583 --> 01:01:32,791

of the day I realize I'm too cool for her.

01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,375
Oh, yeah, because wearing
fishnet stockings as arm warmers

1079

is so cool.

1083
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,166
I don't know.

1084
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:56,000
If I'm being honest,
maybe without realizing it,

1085
01:01:56,083 --> 01:01:59,208
I think I push people away.

1086
01:02:00,208 --> 01:02:02,666
I think sometimes I come off
as a little intense.

[girls laughing]

1088
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
What?

1089
01:02:07,416 --> 01:02:10,458
We're not laughing at you.
It's just that it makes so much sense.

1090
01:02:10,541 --> 01:02:12,916
Like how you were standoffish at first.

1091

1099
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,833

Um, I just don't like parties.

1107
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:04,208
You don't like them anymore?

1108

Uh, you know about Abe.

1109
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:18,208

- What? No, no, Eli.

1110
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:20,916
No.

1111
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,625
What happened to Abe,
it... it wasn't your fault.

1112
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:27,583
It wasn't my fault?

1113
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,958
- It wasn't, and I...
- Hold on. Hold on. Are... are you serious?

1114
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:37,125
Auden, do you why know I liked you?
You didn't say stupid shit like that.

1115
01:03:37,208 --> 01:03:41,000
- What does... what does that even mean?
- I didn't say stupid stuff.

1116
01:03:41,875 --> 01:03:43,375
Look, I'm sorry. Uh...

1117
01:03:44,916 --> 01:03:50,666
You should go to the party and have fun,
but I, uh, I can't, so... I'm sorry.

you're a firework, baby.

1151

Hey, guys. Cala's been texting me
exclusively in haikus.

1152

"Meat? I'm a vegan."

1154
01:05:49,291 --> 01:05:51,500

"My AC works fine."

1156
01:05:54,333 --> 01:05:57,250
I don't think it's that hard to decipher.
She's not coming.

1157

- [laughs] Yo, Auden, over here.

Oh, dude, what about the Spin Doctors?

01:06:14,375 --> 01:06:16,750
- Huh?
- Dude, that's already a band.

1164

Uh, let's see. Colby sucks.

1378

you turn it back on me.

- I think you're the one with the problem.

- I'm the one with the problem?
- Yeah.

I'm not talking about that with you.

Yep, fine. Deflect.
