1
00:02:23,321 --> 00:02:25,551
Secure from quarters.
All ahead two-thirds.

2
00:02:25,624 --> 00:02:26,886
All ahead two-thirds.

3
00:02:27,192 --> 00:02:30,423
Come left, heading 190.
Set depth for 100 meters.

4
00:02:30,662 --> 00:02:35,122
Aye, aye! 20 degrees down angle
on the bow planes. Come left 190.

5
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:37,867
-Range to destination?
-Eight kilometers.

6
00:03:12,604 --> 00:03:14,765
Hoskins, what are the conditions up there?

7
00:03:14,873 --> 00:03:17,967
Thirty degrees below zero, sir,
and we've got a storm moving in.

8
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,475
Landing party on deck.

9
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:23,847
Collect your data quickly
and get back to the ship.

10
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:26,577
No one can survive for long
in that kind of cold.

11
00:04:08,393 --> 00:04:09,291
Koonak.

12
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:13,859
Do you have dinner?

13
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:17,665
Salmon!

14
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:37,615
One hundred meters to surface. Reading
a layer of ice beneath mountainous terrain.

15
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,350
Possibly a cave.

16
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:41,858
-All back one-third.
-All back one-third.

17
00:04:56,241 --> 00:05:01,008
Fifteen years today, darling.
Did you think l would forget?

18
00:05:03,548 --> 00:05:04,674
How could l?

19
00:05:06,318 --> 00:05:09,253
The day we met
was the happiest day of my life.

20
00:05:12,691 --> 00:05:16,320
A gift for you. l found it in the snow.

21
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:21,465
Fragile beauty clinging to life
in this frozen wasteland.

22
00:05:22,868 --> 00:05:24,233
Like you, Nora.

23
00:05:30,642 --> 00:05:34,942
Thirty meters below surface and closing.
Estimate impact in fifteen seconds.

24
00:05:41,386 --> 00:05:43,547
How long does she have to stay in there?

25
00:05:44,322 --> 00:05:46,347
Until a cure can be found.

26
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:50,786
Until then, my love, we'll be here together.

27
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:12,839
Nora!

28
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,291
Let's move out.

29
00:07:16,982 --> 00:07:20,440
-Man, l've never seen it that cold.
-Let's get inside.

30
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:28,917
What in the name of....

31
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:35,828
My God! What happened?

32
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:41,070
-lt's the whole crew.
-Not quite.

33
00:08:43,268 --> 00:08:45,828
You punks have robbed me
for the last time.

34
00:08:45,904 --> 00:08:48,771
Myron, let the police handle it.
Come away.

35
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,775
-Do what she says, old man.
-l'm not afraid of you.

36
00:08:57,148 --> 00:08:58,172
Myron!

37
00:08:59,217 --> 00:09:00,514
l warned you, mister.

38
00:09:06,658 --> 00:09:07,556
Drive!

39
00:09:16,101 --> 00:09:19,832
Man, there must be
a couple of grand worth of stuff here.

40
00:09:20,138 --> 00:09:22,231
Yeah, l told you it'd be easy.

41
00:09:28,246 --> 00:09:29,304
What was that?

42
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,264
-Let's call the cops.
-Yeah, come on!

43
00:09:53,738 --> 00:09:55,763
-What happened?
-l don't know.

44
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:05,981
Jeez!

45
00:10:32,944 --> 00:10:34,468
Please, don't hurt me.

46
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:52,428
Listen, scum,
we're going to be watching you.

47
00:11:00,738 --> 00:11:03,070
Keep your hands where we can see them.

48
00:11:11,316 --> 00:11:13,750
-Yes, Alfred.
-We're running late, sir.

49
00:11:13,918 --> 00:11:15,510
The party has already started.

50
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:18,852
-Meet us in two minutes.
-Very good, sir. On my way.

51
00:11:44,349 --> 00:11:46,977
Thanks, Alfred.
l don't know what we'd do without you.

52
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:50,112
Frankly, sir, neither do l.

53
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:20,812
-Bruce!
-John, looks like a good turnout.

54
00:12:20,885 --> 00:12:23,046
-Thanks for inviting us.
-Have a good time.

55
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:27,581
-There you are. Hello, Bruce, Dick.
-Commissioner.

56
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:30,283
-Good to see a familiar face.
-Where's Barbara?

57
00:12:30,428 --> 00:12:33,226
You know my daughter.
She's probably still getting ready.

58
00:12:39,937 --> 00:12:41,029
My little girl.

59
00:12:41,172 --> 00:12:43,697
You know, Dick,
there's no one sweeter in the world.

60
00:12:53,785 --> 00:12:56,811
You've got plenty of competition.
Lots of guys are after her.

61
00:12:57,322 --> 00:12:59,449
-l'm out of here! Go!
-Move it!

62
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:01,920
Are you all right?

63
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:08,228
Hey! Thanks.

64
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:11,463
But don't worry, you're on top of her list.

65
00:13:16,074 --> 00:13:20,568
-You and Barbara getting serious?
-Maybe. You got any advice on women?

66
00:13:20,878 --> 00:13:24,405
There you are.
Bruce, where have you been?

67
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,009
My friends are just dying to meet you.

68
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:31,582
Let me get back to you on that.

69
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:37,053
Here he is, ladies.
Gotham's most elusive bachelor.

70
00:13:37,462 --> 00:13:39,123
lsn't he handsome?

71
00:13:39,564 --> 00:13:45,434
-Bruce, this is Buffy and Debra and Caitlin.
-Hello, Bruce! So nice to meet you!

72
00:13:52,043 --> 00:13:53,442
Well, excuse you.

73
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:57,139
l'd keep my money
in low-risk mutual funds...

74
00:13:57,248 --> 00:13:59,716
-...that way, if the market dips--
-We have to talk.

75
00:14:00,284 --> 00:14:03,014
Gregory, l didn't know
we had a meeting scheduled.

76
00:14:03,154 --> 00:14:05,179
-Would you excuse us for a minute?
-Hey!

77
00:14:05,656 --> 00:14:10,286
-How come you're not returning my calls?
-l told you, there's nothing more l can do.

78
00:14:10,495 --> 00:14:13,430
You're my stockbroker.
You got me into this, now get me out.

79
00:14:13,498 --> 00:14:16,626
l got you....
Listen, you got yourself into this.

80
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:18,792
l warned you that futures are risky.

81
00:14:19,103 --> 00:14:22,368
Everything l own is on the line here.
This will ruin me!

82
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:25,567
Hey, you rolled the dice,
you'd better be able to cover the bet.

83
00:14:25,643 --> 00:14:29,409
Those calls come due in a few days,
and you're legally required to pay them.

84
00:14:29,547 --> 00:14:31,139
But l don't have the cash.

85
00:14:31,482 --> 00:14:35,816
-Can't you stall, buy me some time?
-l'm sorry. There's nothing more l can do.

86
00:14:38,823 --> 00:14:39,619
Thanks.

87
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,014
Hey there!

88
00:15:08,486 --> 00:15:09,384
Sweetheart.

89
00:15:09,587 --> 00:15:11,612
Hi, Dad. Sorry l'm late.

90
00:15:14,358 --> 00:15:16,588
Look at you. Honey, you're a knockout!

91
00:15:16,928 --> 00:15:18,156
Thanks, Dad.

92
00:15:18,796 --> 00:15:22,596
Someone's been looking for you.
Boy, is he one lucky guy.

93
00:15:22,767 --> 00:15:25,634
Hey, what's the idea
of keeping me waiting so long?

94
00:15:26,604 --> 00:15:28,071
Just playing hard to get.

95
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:31,104
-She is hard to get.
-Dad!

96
00:15:31,776 --> 00:15:34,006
Well, before your dance card fills up,
may l?

97
00:15:35,146 --> 00:15:37,944
-l get the next dance.
-Don't count on it.

98
00:15:41,652 --> 00:15:45,816
Expect record highs for the rest of the
week with temperatures in the mid-90s.

99
00:16:00,204 --> 00:16:01,068
Jeez!

100
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,334
-Hello, Gregory.
-Victor? My God, is that you?

101
00:16:34,138 --> 00:16:36,470
You're a hard man to get a hold of, Doctor.

102
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:40,277
Your secretary wouldn't give me
an appointment until next September.

103
00:16:40,912 --> 00:16:43,506
Now, is that any way
to treat an old colleague?

104
00:16:44,148 --> 00:16:47,948
-What do you want?
-l've got a patient who needs you.

105
00:16:51,989 --> 00:16:54,890
-Leaving so soon?
-l have to work late tonight.

106
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,324
l've heard that before.

107
00:16:56,794 --> 00:17:00,662
-l'll call you tomorrow, Ronnie. l promise.
-l've heard that one, too.

108
00:17:01,499 --> 00:17:04,627
We're going to dance some more.
Barbara will give me a ride home.

109
00:17:04,702 --> 00:17:05,964
Have a nice time.

110
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:09,133
l wish l were.

111
00:17:15,613 --> 00:17:17,672
l thought you wanted to dance some more.

112
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:21,143
l do, but first l wanted
to ask you something.

113
00:17:21,352 --> 00:17:24,287
-What?
-Well, l was wondering....

114
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:25,619
What?

115
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,485
You want to go up the coast
for the weekend?

116
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:31,692
-Sure. With who?
-With me!

117
00:17:34,265 --> 00:17:38,133
There's a jazz festival in Rockport,
and there's stuff going on at the beach.

118
00:17:38,936 --> 00:17:40,927
Sounds fun. l'd love to.

119
00:17:41,672 --> 00:17:43,765
Really? That's great!

120
00:18:04,562 --> 00:18:07,258
Alfred, would you mind turning up
the air conditioning?

121
00:18:08,866 --> 00:18:09,924
Good heavens!

122
00:18:12,937 --> 00:18:15,906
Strange. There's not a cloud in the sky.

123
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,385
Belongs to someone named Belson.

124
00:18:47,738 --> 00:18:48,932
lt's not good.

125
00:18:49,306 --> 00:18:52,605
When her containment vessel ruptured,
her disease relapsed.

126
00:18:52,677 --> 00:18:55,544
-She's got a couple of weeks at best.
-What?

127
00:18:55,613 --> 00:18:58,844
Don't shoot the messenger, Victor.
l'm just telling you like it is.

128
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:01,612
Nothing can save her now,
short of an organ transplant.

129
00:19:01,786 --> 00:19:02,946
Then, do it.

130
00:19:03,354 --> 00:19:07,848
lmpossible. You need a compatible donor,
and there's a waiting list a mile long.

131
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,024
We'd never get the organ in time.

132
00:19:10,494 --> 00:19:14,897
-l have confidence you'll find a way.
-Don't threaten me, Victor.

133
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:18,234
l'm the only hope she's got.
And this is going to cost you.

134
00:19:18,436 --> 00:19:21,530
The kind of service we're talking
about here doesn't come cheap.

135
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:25,599
Gregory. l see you haven't changed.

136
00:19:28,879 --> 00:19:29,846
Gold?

137
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:46,154
There aren't any available organs.

138
00:19:47,298 --> 00:19:50,165
-What about these?
-Not compatible.

139
00:19:50,768 --> 00:19:52,861
Nora's blood type is extremely rare.

140
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:55,734
There aren't any deceased donors
that match.

141
00:19:56,273 --> 00:20:01,233
-Then we'll have to use a live donor.
-What? Are you crazy? They'd die!

142
00:20:01,746 --> 00:20:02,770
l know.

143
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:09,280
Man, you're a piece of work.
l said l'd help, but this....

144
00:20:09,453 --> 00:20:12,251
This is going to cost you
more than a little gold nugget.

145
00:20:12,389 --> 00:20:14,152
l mean, the risks involved....

146
00:20:14,592 --> 00:20:18,858
This is just a small sample
from a large vein l discovered in the Arctic.

147
00:20:19,396 --> 00:20:22,524
You do this, and it's yours. All of it.

148
00:20:29,707 --> 00:20:32,733
These hospital files
list every blood donor in Gotham.

149
00:20:33,444 --> 00:20:37,380
We want someone who's approximately
the same weight, height, and female.

150
00:20:44,288 --> 00:20:45,312
Here's one.

151
00:20:46,624 --> 00:20:47,784
Perfect.

152
00:20:49,226 --> 00:20:51,956
Her name is Barbara Gordon.

153
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,039
-Hello?
-Barbara Gordon?

154
00:21:08,512 --> 00:21:10,912
No, she's not here.
This is Jenny, her roommate.

155
00:21:11,282 --> 00:21:14,547
-What time do you expect her in?
-She won't be back till Monday.

156
00:21:14,752 --> 00:21:18,051
-Who is this, please?
-This is County Memorial Hospital.

157
00:21:18,222 --> 00:21:20,383
Barbara's listed with us as a blood donor.

158
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,822
She's dining out with her boyfriend.
They are at the coast for the weekend.

159
00:21:25,396 --> 00:21:28,160
We've got an emergency.
Where did they go for dinner?

160
00:21:28,265 --> 00:21:30,961
l think she said Shaugnessy's,
over on Madison.

161
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,231
Thanks.

162
00:22:08,372 --> 00:22:09,236
Hey!

163
00:22:14,912 --> 00:22:16,140
Didn't spill a drop.

164
00:22:19,216 --> 00:22:21,741
-Oh, man!
-lt could have been worse.

165
00:22:22,553 --> 00:22:25,283
-Yeah, how?
-lt could have been me.

166
00:22:27,258 --> 00:22:31,490
-We got enough left for a toast?
-Sure. What will we drink to?

167
00:22:32,263 --> 00:22:34,697
How about the kiss
you're about to give me?

168
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:36,696
l'll drink to that.

169
00:22:43,574 --> 00:22:44,768
Mr. Freeze?

170
00:22:52,816 --> 00:22:55,216
You, fruitcake! No pets allowed!

171
00:23:01,058 --> 00:23:02,719
Which one of you is Barbara Gordon?

172
00:23:10,167 --> 00:23:10,929
Him.

173
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:19,299
Please, no.

174
00:23:20,878 --> 00:23:23,278
Get him off! Get him off me!

175
00:23:24,481 --> 00:23:28,212
l'll ask again.
Which one of you is Barbara Gordon?

176
00:23:29,353 --> 00:23:31,287
-Barbara, no!
-l am.

177
00:23:32,423 --> 00:23:33,412
Let him go.

178
00:23:36,026 --> 00:23:37,152
Come with me.

179
00:23:47,738 --> 00:23:49,501
Notchka, don't let her go.

180
00:24:36,687 --> 00:24:39,713
Stop it! l'll come with you.
Just don't hurt him.

181
00:24:41,492 --> 00:24:42,686
Shaka, come.

182
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:49,025
Here! Take my Corvette.

183
00:25:51,161 --> 00:25:52,492
Hey! Watch it!

184
00:26:34,771 --> 00:26:37,569
All units,
this is Unit 7 in pursuit of a gray van...

185
00:26:37,641 --> 00:26:40,007
...moving east on Highway 10.
Request backup.

186
00:26:40,077 --> 00:26:41,203
Roger, Unit 7.

187
00:27:16,947 --> 00:27:17,879
Hey!

188
00:29:21,171 --> 00:29:24,402
-Who are you?
-l'm a doctor. Keep still.

189
00:29:24,908 --> 00:29:26,000
Where am l?

190
00:29:29,413 --> 00:29:31,347
Take these. You'll feel better.

191
00:29:36,453 --> 00:29:38,683
-Why did you kidnap me?
-Silence!

192
00:29:41,224 --> 00:29:42,919
Do as you're told. Take them.

193
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:46,663
Victor, no!

194
00:29:47,464 --> 00:29:50,729
Miss Gordon obviously prefers
not to take any medication right now.

195
00:29:51,835 --> 00:29:54,099
Why don't we give her
some time to herself?.

196
00:29:54,838 --> 00:29:56,897
l want to know what's going on here.

197
00:30:12,422 --> 00:30:16,791
l want checkpoints on a 20-mile radius
at l-13, l-54, and out to Route 27.

198
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,161
Choppers with infrared scopes,
and a door-to-door search...

199
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,494
...of every possible hideout within 50 miles.

200
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,428
Montoya, set up a command post
in the operations room.

201
00:30:26,503 --> 00:30:27,333
Right.

202
00:30:27,537 --> 00:30:30,768
-Did you get a rundown on the license?
-lt's a stolen van.

203
00:30:31,274 --> 00:30:34,437
They found it ditched in Brisco Canyon
about an hour ago.

204
00:30:35,379 --> 00:30:39,679
All right, that's pretty rugged terrain.
They can't have gotten too far on foot.

205
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:43,850
Set up checkpoints at a 20-mile radius,
and search all the way down to the ocean.

206
00:30:44,588 --> 00:30:48,684
Come on, people. A guy in a weird suit
with two polar bears can't be hard to spot.

207
00:30:49,092 --> 00:30:51,583
l want my daughter found,
and l want her found now.

208
00:30:51,795 --> 00:30:55,697
-Don't worry, sir. We're on it.
-Then why are you still here talking to me?

209
00:30:55,832 --> 00:30:57,265
Come on, let's move out.

210
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,564
Dick, you okay?

211
00:31:01,872 --> 00:31:04,932
-Sorry, Commissioner. l tried to stop him.
-l know.

212
00:31:05,175 --> 00:31:07,006
When l get my hands on this guy....

213
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:10,375
-Jim, why would Freeze want Barbara?
-l don't know.

214
00:31:10,881 --> 00:31:13,907
-How'd he know she was at the nightclub?
-Her roommate.

215
00:31:14,785 --> 00:31:17,777
Said someone called from the hospital
with an emergency.

216
00:31:18,021 --> 00:31:19,852
Barbara's listed as a blood donor.

217
00:31:20,023 --> 00:31:23,151
-Did she get a name?
-No. The guy hung up on her.

218
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,859
Get a hold of the phone records
and see if you can trace that call.

219
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:31,196
Commissioner,
the other witnesses are in interrogation.

220
00:31:31,368 --> 00:31:35,634
On my way.
Dick, thanks again for trying to save her.

221
00:31:37,974 --> 00:31:40,602
-Mr. Grayson, what is your blood type?
-O positive.

222
00:31:42,913 --> 00:31:46,440
l need to get you down to X-ray.
You wait here. l'll get a wheelchair.

223
00:31:50,387 --> 00:31:51,445
Shut the door.

224
00:32:06,403 --> 00:32:09,099
-Does it say who accessed her file?
-No.

225
00:32:13,376 --> 00:32:16,470
She has a rare blood type.
Not many others on the list.

226
00:32:17,881 --> 00:32:20,076
Wait a minute. Look at this.

227
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:22,216
Nora Fries?

228
00:32:23,453 --> 00:32:25,114
Victor Fries' wife.

229
00:33:15,472 --> 00:33:16,939
She's over the next room.

230
00:33:36,459 --> 00:33:38,654
She's headed
towards the northwest corner.

231
00:34:30,814 --> 00:34:31,940
Get away from her!

232
00:34:33,717 --> 00:34:35,082
You get away from me.

233
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,818
Give it up, Barbara.
There's no place to run.

234
00:34:42,892 --> 00:34:46,055
-Everybody, just calm down.
-No! You calm down.

235
00:34:46,229 --> 00:34:48,060
l want to know what l'm doing here.

236
00:34:48,298 --> 00:34:51,529
l'm Dr. Gregory Belson. That's Victor Fries.

237
00:34:52,068 --> 00:34:55,265
l know who he is.
Everyone in Gotham knows you.

238
00:34:55,505 --> 00:34:59,464
And l know who that is, too.
l thought your wife was dead.

239
00:34:59,843 --> 00:35:02,107
She will be dead if you don't help her.

240
00:35:02,512 --> 00:35:06,073
That's what this is about, isn't it?
lt's about her.

241
00:35:06,716 --> 00:35:09,617
She needs an operation
that requires a transfusion.

242
00:35:09,886 --> 00:35:12,514
You're one of the few people
with her rare blood type.

243
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:16,418
So, why here? She should be in a hospital.

244
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:18,823
No hospitals and no more questions!

245
00:35:18,962 --> 00:35:21,658
Victor! You wouldn't let her die,
would you?

246
00:35:21,965 --> 00:35:25,457
Listen. You kidnap me,
then expect me to cooperate?

247
00:35:26,002 --> 00:35:28,436
l'll help her, but not here. Not this way.

248
00:35:28,705 --> 00:35:29,637
Enough talk!

249
00:35:33,276 --> 00:35:35,301
Victor, no! Don't freeze her.

250
00:35:48,391 --> 00:35:49,289
The door!

251
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,418
Come on.

252
00:37:41,971 --> 00:37:42,835
Mariko?

253
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,041
Bruce, Dick. What a nice surprise.
Come in, come in.

254
00:37:47,443 --> 00:37:50,435
-What can l do for you?
-l was wondering if you could help me.

255
00:37:50,713 --> 00:37:52,908
Are you kidding?
One of our major investors?

256
00:37:53,116 --> 00:37:54,276
What do you need?

257
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:57,615
How much do you know
about the medical aspects of cryogenics?

258
00:37:57,887 --> 00:38:02,153
Well, it's not exactly my specialty,
but l've done some reading on it.

259
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:06,959
When would a person who's cryogenically
frozen need a blood transfusion?

260
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,863
As far as l know, never.
That's the point of the procedure.

261
00:38:11,467 --> 00:38:13,958
You should talk to someone
who is more of an expert.

262
00:38:14,037 --> 00:38:16,267
Who is the foremost authority
on the subject?

263
00:38:16,973 --> 00:38:19,373
That's easy. Dr. Gregory Belson.

264
00:38:19,576 --> 00:38:22,602
He did a lot of the original research
on it with Victor Fries.

265
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,483
l'd like to talk to him.

266
00:38:28,985 --> 00:38:31,317
Good luck.
No one's seen him for the past week.

267
00:38:31,621 --> 00:38:33,145
-Where is he?
-Who knows?

268
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:36,417
Comes and goes as he pleases.
Frankly, he's kind of a jerk.

269
00:38:38,361 --> 00:38:42,195
Belson's name was on the registration
of a wrecked car Alfred and l found...

270
00:38:42,265 --> 00:38:45,325
...after the party the other night.
lt was surrounded by water.

271
00:38:45,735 --> 00:38:47,862
-Melted ice.
-Right.

272
00:38:48,204 --> 00:38:51,833
-So what does Freeze want with a doctor?
-Let's find out.

273
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:59,204
You don't have to chain me up, you creep.

274
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:03,248
Try to escape again,
l'll chain your feet as well.

275
00:39:03,386 --> 00:39:07,322
-How can you treat people this way?
-lt's the way they've always treated me.

276
00:39:09,726 --> 00:39:13,492
Nora was the only good thing in my life,
and they took her from me.

277
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,398
l don't care what l have to do
to get her back.

278
00:39:35,418 --> 00:39:38,979
-Nothing here, except some stock reports.
-Keep looking.

279
00:39:46,229 --> 00:39:49,096
Gregory, this is your broker calling
for the third time.

280
00:39:49,332 --> 00:39:52,893
Payment is due on those options
and accounting is breathing down my neck.

281
00:39:52,969 --> 00:39:57,303
You can call me at home.
The number's 555-01 73.

282
00:39:57,607 --> 00:39:59,598
Let's take care of this, okay?

283
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,704
Hope it's a listed number.

284
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:10,908
Bingo.

285
00:40:24,534 --> 00:40:25,364
Dinner.

286
00:40:27,003 --> 00:40:29,665
-Who are you?
-My name is Koonak.

287
00:40:30,673 --> 00:40:33,164
You're just a kid.
What are you doing here?

288
00:40:33,309 --> 00:40:37,006
-Did Freeze kidnap you, too?
-No. And l'm not just a kid.

289
00:40:37,347 --> 00:40:39,872
-l'm twelve.
-Twelve?

290
00:40:40,383 --> 00:40:43,910
-And very handsome.
-You're kind of cute, too, lady.

291
00:40:45,154 --> 00:40:48,419
-You sure you're just twelve?
-Thirteen, next summer.

292
00:40:48,691 --> 00:40:52,252
-So, where are your parents, Koonak?
-They're dead.

293
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:57,861
-l'm sorry.
-But Mr. Freeze takes care of me now.

294
00:40:58,468 --> 00:41:02,029
-Freeze? You've got to be kidding.
-You don't like him, do you?

295
00:41:02,271 --> 00:41:05,707
lt's kind of hard to like someone
who kidnaps you and chains you up.

296
00:41:06,242 --> 00:41:08,870
He just wants his wife back.
He's not really bad.

297
00:41:09,245 --> 00:41:11,076
You know this isn't right, Koonak.

298
00:41:11,614 --> 00:41:15,607
Help me get out of here, and l promise
l'll do everything l can to help her.

299
00:41:16,285 --> 00:41:17,752
Sorry, lady. l can't.

300
00:41:24,327 --> 00:41:27,319
-You won't hurt her, will you?
-No, of course not.

301
00:41:28,164 --> 00:41:30,291
Your wife's vital signs have stabilized.

302
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,233
We'll be able to start the operation
in a couple of hours.

303
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:34,464
Good.

304
00:42:07,136 --> 00:42:08,467
Please, don't hurt me!

305
00:42:08,638 --> 00:42:11,436
-Where's Belson?
-Belson? l wish l knew.

306
00:42:13,609 --> 00:42:16,476
-l'm telling you the truth!
-What's your interest in him?

307
00:42:16,546 --> 00:42:20,573
l'm his stockbroker. He owes $2.5 million,
and if he doesn't pay by Friday...

308
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:23,949
-...they're going to foreclose on him.
-What are you talking about?

309
00:42:24,087 --> 00:42:27,250
Belson had inside information
on a new drug that was going public.

310
00:42:27,523 --> 00:42:29,684
He leveraged futures
with everything he had.

311
00:42:29,792 --> 00:42:33,455
Then some side effects were discovered,
and the FDA put everything on hold.

312
00:42:33,763 --> 00:42:35,196
He lost, big time.

313
00:42:35,498 --> 00:42:38,797
l want to see his portfolio,
and any holdings he might have in--

314
00:42:44,207 --> 00:42:46,334
-Hello?
-Dean, this is Gregory.

315
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,702
Gregory? Where are you?

316
00:42:49,479 --> 00:42:51,947
You've got to buy me one more week
with the SEC.

317
00:42:52,348 --> 00:42:56,045
Stall them. Say whatever you have to,
but l'll have the cash by then.

318
00:42:56,586 --> 00:42:58,144
You will? How? You said--

319
00:42:58,287 --> 00:43:01,347
l know what l said, but l just struck gold.

320
00:43:04,393 --> 00:43:06,327
So, you'll take care of that, right?

321
00:43:06,462 --> 00:43:07,486
Where are you?

322
00:43:07,964 --> 00:43:08,828
Never mind.

323
00:43:08,965 --> 00:43:12,423
Just keep them from foreclosing for a week
and they'll have their money.

324
00:43:12,502 --> 00:43:13,366
Got to go.

325
00:43:13,769 --> 00:43:15,202
Gregory? Wait a minute.

326
00:43:40,463 --> 00:43:44,399
Alfred, run this list of medical supplies
l found on Belson's desk.

327
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,234
l want to know
what this stuff would be used for.

328
00:43:47,303 --> 00:43:50,238
Cross-reference it
against all likely medical procedures.

329
00:43:50,306 --> 00:43:51,364
Very good, sir.

330
00:43:57,413 --> 00:44:01,144
-You said--
-l know what l said, but l just struck gold.

331
00:44:01,584 --> 00:44:04,109
-So, you'll take care of that, right?
-Where are you?

332
00:44:04,187 --> 00:44:05,620
That's a ship's foghorn.

333
00:44:06,022 --> 00:44:07,649
He's somewhere near the water.

334
00:44:07,723 --> 00:44:10,191
But the police have combed every inch
of the coast.

335
00:44:10,293 --> 00:44:13,524
Listen to it again.
There's something else in the background.

336
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:15,395
l'll try to enhance it.

337
00:44:15,464 --> 00:44:18,399
...l just struck gold.
So, you'll take care of that, right?

338
00:44:18,768 --> 00:44:22,067
-Sounds like a bell.
-Or a buoy.

339
00:44:22,838 --> 00:44:24,465
Those are the shipping lanes.

340
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:36,051
No wonder the police can't find him
on the coast.

341
00:44:36,185 --> 00:44:36,879
Why?

342
00:44:37,253 --> 00:44:40,689
He's five miles offshore,
in the middle of the ocean.

343
00:44:41,991 --> 00:44:44,050
There's an abandoned oil derrick out there.

344
00:44:59,375 --> 00:45:02,970
-Miss Gordon, we're ready to begin.
-Well, l'm not.

345
00:45:03,479 --> 00:45:05,276
l'm afraid you have no choice.

346
00:45:16,058 --> 00:45:16,854
Grab her!

347
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:20,659
No!

348
00:45:21,197 --> 00:45:22,255
Hold her legs.

349
00:45:32,975 --> 00:45:36,172
Pardon me, but l've just completed
the research on this list...

350
00:45:36,245 --> 00:45:38,509
...and l've found something
rather disturbing.

351
00:45:38,581 --> 00:45:39,479
What is it?

352
00:45:39,548 --> 00:45:43,712
lt seems these are surgical supplies
used in an allograft procedure.

353
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:45,644
Oh, no.

354
00:45:46,555 --> 00:45:47,487
What is it?

355
00:45:47,556 --> 00:45:49,922
lt's the medical term
for an organ transplant.

356
00:45:50,526 --> 00:45:51,220
What?

357
00:45:52,061 --> 00:45:53,551
l think you'd better hurry.

358
00:46:14,116 --> 00:46:16,641
You're hurting me. Let me go.

359
00:46:22,825 --> 00:46:23,951
Get her inside.

360
00:46:28,264 --> 00:46:29,663
Let me go!

361
00:46:30,299 --> 00:46:33,097
Put her on the table.
l'll get the anesthesia.

362
00:46:38,074 --> 00:46:40,838
You don't need to put me under
for a blood transfusion.

363
00:46:43,245 --> 00:46:44,940
lt's more than that, isn't it?

364
00:46:46,482 --> 00:46:47,312
Hold her.

365
00:46:50,619 --> 00:46:52,280
You promised not to hurt her!

366
00:46:52,488 --> 00:46:53,955
Koonak, get out of here.

367
00:46:55,691 --> 00:46:56,589
Stop it!

368
00:46:58,928 --> 00:47:00,088
Get away!

369
00:47:05,501 --> 00:47:07,492
Nora! No! No!

370
00:47:26,856 --> 00:47:28,118
l'll get her back.

371
00:47:39,335 --> 00:47:40,324
Look, there.

372
00:47:55,317 --> 00:47:56,807
Someone's there, all right.

373
00:47:58,087 --> 00:48:00,419
Wait a minute. l see something.

374
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:02,716
There's Barbara!

375
00:48:04,326 --> 00:48:05,850
-Hurry!
-Hang on.

376
00:48:36,992 --> 00:48:39,483
Stop shooting, you idiot!
These are fuel tanks.

377
00:48:39,895 --> 00:48:41,362
Come down, now!

378
00:49:30,579 --> 00:49:31,671
Up here!

379
00:49:32,448 --> 00:49:33,574
Are you all right?

380
00:50:26,569 --> 00:50:28,366
lt's okay. l got her!

381
00:51:01,036 --> 00:51:01,764
Wait.

382
00:51:02,938 --> 00:51:03,666
Wait.

383
00:51:04,974 --> 00:51:05,736
Now!

384
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:29,321
Help!

385
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,858
Over there!

386
00:51:38,807 --> 00:51:40,138
Shoot me a line!

387
00:51:41,977 --> 00:51:43,001
Stand back.

388
00:51:46,515 --> 00:51:47,447
Hurry!

389
00:51:52,988 --> 00:51:53,750
You!

390
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:56,086
Look out!

391
00:52:25,387 --> 00:52:26,411
Barbara!

392
00:52:41,136 --> 00:52:43,627
-We got to get out of here!
-l'm working on it.

393
00:52:57,886 --> 00:53:01,378
She's behind the generators, over there!
You go that way!

394
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:05,683
-Are you crazy? There's no way now.
-We're going to finish this!

395
00:53:06,028 --> 00:53:08,826
You're insane!
This place is going to blow any minute!

396
00:53:08,931 --> 00:53:10,057
We got to get out.

397
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:14,632
We're not leaving
until you perform that operation.

398
00:53:21,677 --> 00:53:22,473
Look out!

399
00:53:36,391 --> 00:53:38,484
Gregory, help me!

400
00:53:55,244 --> 00:53:56,302
Brace yourself!

401
00:54:13,495 --> 00:54:15,019
My leg is broken.

402
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:35,641
-Come on. Let's get out of here.
-No! Not without Nora.

403
00:54:36,285 --> 00:54:38,185
-Where is she?
-Down below.

404
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,880
There's a boy there, too.
Come on, this way!

405
00:54:43,892 --> 00:54:44,950
There's no way.

406
00:54:46,662 --> 00:54:47,560
Stand back.

407
00:54:58,073 --> 00:54:58,835
Hurry!

408
00:55:01,844 --> 00:55:04,813
-You stay here.
-You need me to show you where they are.

409
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:07,642
She's right. Robin, get the Batwing ready.

410
00:55:07,883 --> 00:55:11,284
-lf this place starts to blow, get out.
-l won't leave without you.

Come on, big guy. l've got you.

-The elevator.

416
00:57:21,717 --> 00:57:22,706
Oh, no.

417
00:57:42,804 --> 00:57:43,668
Let's go!

418
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:47,167
Take them first.
You can come back for me.

419
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:30,417
Let's go. Let's go!

420

-What? Wait!

421
