1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,590
Previously on the riches...

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,390
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,690
You want to pretend to be the dead guy?

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,090
You want to wear his suits, 
and you want me to be his dead wife?

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,990
Do you really think dad has a plan?

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,390
He stole the money, ma lost the money,

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,090
and now we're here in a dead guy's house.

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,490
Y'all aren't in the witness 
protection program, are you?

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,490
'Cause I've been thinking about it,

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,990
and it just doesn't quite make sense.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,190
I don't want to put you on the spot.

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,390
What is going on?

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,690
You're my friend, nina.

14
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,190
I would never lie to you about that.

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,090
I went to taos, did some spirit shit, 
cleaned myself right out.

16
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,190
And there you met, uh...

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,590
that's geegee, and she's a dancer.

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,190
A miracle happened.

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,690
I fell in love, and I married her.

20
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,990
- Doug.
- Dale.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,891
We have a lot to talk about, my friend.

22
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,190
Dad, we have to do somethin'.Dale 
came here for us.

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,290
He's not goin' anywhere.

24
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,890
Dale seems to have been here for a while now.

25
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,190
He could've blown our cover at any point, 
and he didn'T.

26
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,190
Why is that?

27
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,290
He's dale.He's workin' an angle.
I don't know.

28
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,290
Doug is a republican.
His best friend is pete.

29
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,390
Pete's a mortgage broker from dallas.
He's e-mailed twice about a golf trip.

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,490
- Hello.
- Hi.

31
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,090
Is, uh, doug here?

32
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,090
Doug who?

33
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,490
Pete.

34
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,390
Guess you're probably surprised 
to see me here, wayne.

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,090
You and I both know you're not doug rich,

36
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,290
though everyone here seems to think you are.

37
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,390
Who are you?

38
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,990
And where the hell is my best friend doug rich?

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,690
Who are you?

40
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,590
Look, don't get upset.

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,790
I thought you were my guardian angel.

42
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,390
There's a rational explanation 
for all of this.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,990
Hey, there, little fella.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,090
Pow.

45
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,290
Come on, davey, quit playin' around.

46
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,790
Pow.

47
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,890
Is that a real gun?

48
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,390
Is it?

49
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,490
Where's doug?

50
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,090
Bang.

51
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,990
well***

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,190
Ho, ho, ho, there you are.

53
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,290
Now, what's all this I hear 
about you shootin' folks with guns?

54
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,890
Now, you go back to my office 
and wait till I get there.

55
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,790
Don't go postal on me now.

56
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,190
Got you where it counts.

57
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,190
Well, he's a good kid, really.

58
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,190
Who the hell is he?

59
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,290
He's geegee'S.

60
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,390
It's a long story.

61
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,890
Hugh panetta.

62
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,290
Hugh panetta, pete mintzy, an old friend.

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,590
Um, he's a little depressed, a little unstable.

64
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,390
Seems like a freak.

65
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,590
Good luck.

66
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,590
I'm not your friend.

67
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,890
I understand how you feel.

68
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,990
You fraud.You told me you were a shrink.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,490
- I wanted to help you.
- I don't want your help.

70
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,790
I want doug.

71
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,190
All right.

72
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,390
Can you just give me 30 seconds?

73
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,690
- Are you out of your freakin' mind?
- I gotta clean myself up.

74
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,290
It looks like someone's hit me 
with a bat, for god's sakes.

75
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,790
Just wait.I'll be right here.

76
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,690
Baby, I'll be there soon.

77
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,690
Nina just came over for some tea and--

78
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,190
pete's here.He knows.

79
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,790
Skaal krush.Skaal krush.Skaal krush.

80
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,390
I am not some jackass you can all push around.

81
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,890
- I'm not waiting on any--
- ho, ho, ho!

82
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,990
What's wrong with this guy?

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,990
I got a kid here!
He doesn't need to hear this shit!

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,790
It's all right.I'm--it's under control.

85
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,690
Do you want to know who I am?

86
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,190
Don't give me that montpierre shit,

87
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,790
or I will go in there and tell 
everyone you're an impostor.

88
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,690
I'm gene.Gene morrongiello.

89
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,490
I'm a lawyer, just like doug.

90
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,890
He contacted me a few months ago.

91
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,090
He asked me to do this.

92
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,290
- He asked you to pretend to be him?
- Yes!

93
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,690
I know how it sounds.

94
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,990
Go do his job, live in his house.

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,490
I had a million questions,

96
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,490
but he paid me to keep those questions to myself.

97
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,190
Why?

98
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,390
I don't know.

99
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,590
Pete, I just don't know.Life is a mystery.

100
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,190
But what it comes down to, was that a man, 
a human being, needed help.

101
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,890
Prove it.

102
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,590
Which part?

103
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,990
How do I know you're gene moron...

104
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,690
or whatever your name is?

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,790
- I need to talk to him.
- I don't know where he is.

106
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,190
- You said you knew!
- I mean metaphysically.

107
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,390
I know where he's at.

108
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,490
You're lying.

109
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,090
You know where he is, and you're not telling me.

110
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,090
Either that, or something's wrong, 
and I better call the police.

111
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,290
Jesus, pete, I'm not supposed to 
tell you this.

112
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,090
Doug told me not to.

113
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,090
He's in hiding.

114
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,090
I don't know where he is, 
but I know how to contact him,

115
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,290
and I will take you to him.

116
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,190
Okay?

Pete's back.Skaal krush.

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,590
What are you holdin' there, dahlia?

123
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,290
Oh, nothin'.

124
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,590
Shit.I'm sorry, nina.

125
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,990
Honey, I don't need your "sorry.

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,390
" Doesn't take a rocket scientist 
to know somethin's up.

127
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,890
Look me in the eye and tell me what it is.

128
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,690
I can'T.

129
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,190
- Are you in trouble?
- Yeah.

130
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,890
- Well, let me help.
- You can't, okay?

131
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,090
Best thing you can do is just walk 
out the door right now

132
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,090
and pretend like you don't know me.

133
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,190
Pretend everything's all right.

134
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,990
All right?

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,990
Nina, I love you.Get out.

136
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,590
Which is yr car?You can follow me.

137
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,690
What do you take me for, a complete idiot?

138
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,690
I'm going with you.

139
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,690
I'm just trying to be helpful.

140
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,390
Yeah?Why do we have to go back to 
your house anyway?

141
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,890
Why can't we call doug now?

142
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,790
That is the important question.

143
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,190
I've got to make the call from 
the home phone.

144
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,690
If I don't, it's a signal to doug 
that there is a problem.

145
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,390
If I leave a coded message for doug 
from my home phone,

146
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,890
he will know it is clear, 
and he will call me back, okay?

147
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,590
And then I can talk to him?

148
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,290
That's the other important question.

149
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,390
Doug expressly wished that 
no one talk to him on the phone

150
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,490
in case it's tapped.

151
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,090
Forget this.I'm going to the police.

152
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,890
No, don't freak out on me here 
because then we go and meet him.

153
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,290
That's what you wanted, to look him in the eye.

154
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,590
That's what you said.

155
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,890
Gene, there's somethin' about you.

156
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,090
Jesus christ!

157
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,090
What the hell?

158
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,190
Hey.

159
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,690
I am so sorry about that.

160
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,690
That's not a problem, sir, 
don't worry about it.

161
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,090
No problem?
I scraped up your whole rear end.

162
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,790
Just get his insurance information.

163
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,990
Listen to the man.

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,490
I'm greg, greg buffer.

165
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,090
How you doin' there?
How's your neck?

166
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,590
We gotta go, greg, so, uh, 
don't worry about the damages.

167
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,190
Well, I can't let you go without 
payin' you for that rear end.

168
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,590
That would be un-american.

169
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,990
Oh, darn it.

170
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,290
I thought I had some cash.

171
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,390
I said it'll be all right.

172
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,290
Jeez, your associate's a little uppity here.

173
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,290
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

174
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,190
I'm a handyman by trade.

175
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,790
How about I come over, 
take a gander at your house,

176
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,690
and we'll see how I can help.

177
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,490
We'll barter, know what I mean?

178
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,890
Well, we're in a bit of a hurry here.

179
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,190
Now is not a good time.

180
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,590
Well, then, I will come by tonight, 
and we'll work out our arrangement here.

181
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,090
I'll take a bottled mochaccino.

182
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,590
Maybe later, mama.

183
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,090
Ain't you sleepy?
It's time for your nap.

184
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,290
I'm thirsty.I made some calls.

185
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,890
Well, there's water in your room.

186
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,890
Hello!

187
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,090
I'm thirsty!

188
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,190
Jesus, mama!

189
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,690
Louise?

190
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,090
We have a visitor.

191
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,090
Well, what happened to you there, sweetheart?

192
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,890
Pete knows everything.

193
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,290
He knows everything?

194
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,990
I mean, the whole arrangement.

195
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,190
Our whole arrangement.

196
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,190
Whole enchilada, everything.

197
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,490
I mean, I told him doug gave 
us specific instructions,

198
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:53,390
he's not to be contacted, ever, by anyone.

199
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,090
Great.

200
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,390
Way to go, gene.

201
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,590
Louise, the man was understandably 
about to contact the police.

202
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,090
It is okay.

203
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,390
I understand.

204
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,090
He wanted to see his friend.

205
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,290
He loves his friend.

206
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,090
It is understandable, and, pete, 
honey, we're on your side.

207
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,190
You tricked me.

208
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,790
You toyed with me.

209
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,290
You were never on my side.

210
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,490
Yeah.

211
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,990
Go get the number, please.

212
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,890
Pete, sweetheart, I'm so sorry 
we lied to you, okay?

213
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,290
I know you're stressed, 
and what you need is a beer.

214
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,590
I don't drink beer.

215
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,190
What you need is a wine cooler, okay?

216
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,090
- I was just--
- you don't have to explain.

217
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,890
I know you don't trust us, 
and I wouldn't trust us, either.

218
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,390
It's real tasty.

219
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,990
I like-- I like raspberry.

220
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,790
Yeah, well, we only got wild berry mist.

221
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,090
Go ahead.It's good.

222
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,490
Come on, pete, you don't want 
any of that wild berry shit.

223
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,590
Yeah, I don't care.

224
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,490
I'll fix you a glenlivet.

225
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,890
I said, I don't give a shit!

226
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,490
Now, find the number and call my friend!

227
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,390
Okay, pete, I have the number.

228
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,890
Phone's just charging up an 
extra couple of minutes.

229
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,590
Won't take me any longer to make you a drink.

230
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,490
Why is this always your plan?

231
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,590
Because it works.

232
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,890
He would be out for a couple of hours,

233
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,090
which would give us enough time 
to grab our shit, cover our tracks,

234
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,090
and get the hell out of here.

235
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,390
We are not giving up.
We are not cutting and running.

236
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,590
Oh, yeah?What are you proposing?

237
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,490
I have another plan.

238
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,390
What is it?

239
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,090
What is your plan?

240
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,890
It's developing now.

241
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,090
It's germinating.

242
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,090
Just-- I can cool this guy.

243
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,890
You give me enough time, I can cool him.

244
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,190
Don't go for the roofie yet.

245
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,290
Wayne, he wants to see his friend.

246
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,290
He wants to see dead doug.

247
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,290
How are you gonna give him that?

248
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,590
Phone's ready!

249
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,190
I don't need the blow-by-blow.

250
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,190
Yes, you do.

251
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,090
You need to absolutely understand 
what is gonna happen here.

252
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,090
I am gonna call into a voicemail system.

253
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,590
You cannot talk.
You cannot make a sound.

254
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,090
If he even suspects that someone else 
is in the room, he will not call back.

255
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,990
He will not make contact with us.

256
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,690
Do you understand?

257
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,190
There's an important set of rules 
that have to happen here.

258
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,890
Now, can you do this?

259
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,990
Now, there is a code.

260
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,590
The code is a song that 
I must sing into the phone.

261
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,690
It's what doug wanted.

262
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,790
Absolute silence.I will make the call.

263
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:11,890
Amazing grace how sweet the sound

264
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:18,790
that saved a wretch like me

265
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,090
I once was lost

266
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:30,590
but now am found was blind,

267
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,190
but now can see

268
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,790
What happens now?

269
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,690
Now we wait.

270
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,890
So how long do we wait?

271
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,390
How long does it take for doug to, you know--

272
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,990
make contact?

273
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,190
Well, it depends.

274
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,290
'Cause one time, it only took 
him an hour to call us back.

275
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,490
Right, honey?

276
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,190
True, though, another time, 
he almost took two days.

277
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,590
Look, I like you guys.

278
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,890
I'm a trusting person.

279
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,490
It's my nature.

280
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,590
I mean, I'm a messed-up person,
but I--

281
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,390
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't say that about yourself.

282
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,690
You're not a messed-up per-- we're all messed up.

283
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,890
Well, what's wrong with being trusting?

284
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,190
I, myself, am the exact same way.

285
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,590
Now, gene here, he doesn't trust a soul.

286
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,590
You tell me somethin', 
you open your heart to me,I'm right there.

287
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,790
You and me are a lot alike, pete.

288
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,790
So how long do we wait?

289
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,990
It's like when you love someone, 
and you go out on a limb with them,

290
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,190
and then, they take you to heaven, 
or they take you to hell...

291
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,390
and sometimes you can't tell the difference.

292
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,990
Yeah, but how long do we wait?

293
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,590
We don't know, pete.

294
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,290
Your guess is as good as ours.

295
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,290
If he doesn't make contact tonight, 
I'm calling the authorities.

296
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,490
If he doesn't call tonight, 
I'm calling the authorities,

297
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,790
and we will get them to call you.

298
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,690
Call me?

299
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,690
At your hotel.

300
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,590
Oh, pete's not goin' anywhere, gene.

301
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,690
No, pete's here till the bitter end.

302
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,790
Ain't you, pete?

303
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,290
Are you hungry, pete?

304
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,790
As a matter of fact, I am, louise.

305
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,690
Well, okay.

306
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,490
Do you play scrabble?

307
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,390
I don'T.

308
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,590
Hey, why are you foldin' those?
We're not even taking 'em.

309
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,990
- It's important.
- What's important?

310
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,990
How you leave things behind.

311
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,890
Hey, sam, what are you doin'?
We need your help.

312
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,090
I have to finish my homework.

313
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,790
Sam, this is it, okay?
Skaal krush.

314
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,890
I'm not going anywhere.

315
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,190
I'm a conscientious objector.

316
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,790
You're a what?

317
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,690
You don't get to be a conscientious objector.

318
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,690
You didn't talk to him about 
this yet, did you?

319
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,990
I can't do it, cal.

320
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,290
I mean, look, he works on this 
thing every single day.

321
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,190
You have to talk to him.

322
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,390
We can't leave this here.

323
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,790
We have to paint over it.

324
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,190
He's not gonna listen to me.

325
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,190
I need your help.

326
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,290
- It's gonna crush him, cal.
- We don't have a choice.

327
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,290
You don't know that.

328
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,590
I mean, there's still hope.

329
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,390
Dad's got a plan.

330
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,790
No, there is no plan.

331
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,790
He has no plan.

332
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,990
He just finished singing 
"amazing grace" to a dead guy,

333
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,790
and as far as I get it,

334
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,890
we're now waiting for the dead 
guy to call us back.

335
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,890
Mom knows what's going on.

336
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,290
Mom's got a fridge full of roofies, di.

337
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,990
Come on, how sophisticated a plan is that?

338
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,490
What in this situation is hopeful, di?

339
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,990
I have a right to hope, cal.

340
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,990
You can't take that away from me.

341
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,090
Biscuit?

342
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,390
I don't like biscuits.

343
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,790
Louise, the man doesn't like biscuits.
Do we have any bread or crackers?

344
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,490
I don't eat carbs.

345
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,490
I'm on a diet.

346
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,190
I usually just have a protein shake.
I guess I should've told you that.

347
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,690
What about just havin' some mac 
and cheese?

348
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,690
Mac and cheese?
Mac and cheese, it's all carbs.

349
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,890
Don't you know the difference 
between proteins and carbs?

350
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,690
What the hell, pete?Live a little.

351
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,190
I would like a protein shake or 
some kind of protein substitute.

352
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,490
We don't have protein substitute.

353
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,690
This is a biscuit.

354
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,690
Goddamn eat one.

355
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,590
Jesus, no wonder doug's in hiding.

356
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,690
slip and slide?

357
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,390
I made it.

358
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,190
It's a part of me now.

359
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,090
I'll tell you a secret, lamar.

360
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,090
Things, people,

361
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,790
they're around a lot longer than we think.

362
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,790
Life takes from you.

363
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,190
It's taking right now,

364
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,090
yet it's still there...

365
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,990
underneath.

366
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,190
shady lady?

367
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,990
I hate to wait.

368
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,090
Sometimes, I feel like that's 
all I do is wait for something

369
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,590
that'll never come.

370
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,490
Oh, it'll come, what we're all waitin' for.

371
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,290
She means death, pete.

372
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,590
Why are you telling me death will come?

373
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,090
I'm not waiting for death.

374
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,390
Well, don't take it personally.

375
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,690
No, no, no, but, you know, 
all I said was that I hate to wait,

376
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,390
and you tell me I'm gonna die?

377
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,690
She's putting it in perspective.

378
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,390
Waiting's not so bad when you 
compare it with death,

379
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,990
that kind of thing-- things like that.

380
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,090
Oh, yeah.

381
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,190
You ever read the bible, pete?

382
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,290
The bible?

383
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,790
Yeah.Not every word, but...

384
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,290
the bible talks a lot about waitin'.

385
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,590
There's this one line that says,

386
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,890
"those who wait shall inherit the earth."
Very famous line.

387
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,390
Very powerful line.

388
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,190
And I believe it to mean patience pays.

389
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,690
I thought it was "the meek.

390
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,690
" What about the meek?

391
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,690
Who inherit the earth.

392
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,590
No.

393
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,390
No, the meek inherit shit, pete.

394
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,690
The meek never inherited nothin'.

395
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,790
You been a victim of a crime, louise?

396
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,590
I've been victimized.

397
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,190
Twelve times, I've been mugged in my life,

398
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,090
which made me realize,

399
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,690
there are two kinds of people in this world--

400
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,190
victims...

401
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,490
and there are criminals.

402
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,290
What about the people who watch?

403
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,390
What about people who try to help?

404
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:40,590
What about the people who do the cpr?

405
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,290
Pete, what's wrong?

406
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,990
People in your life...

407
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,890
you think you'd know them.

408
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,590
You count on them.

409
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,590
I know.

410
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,290
I know.

411
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,290
You count on certain rules to live by,

412
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,890
a certain order to depend upon.

413
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,290
"How could doug do that?

414
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,290
" You ask yourself.

415
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,890
"Who leaves a house?

416
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,490
Who leaves your life?

417
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,590
" And, I mean, wherever doug 
and cherien are right now,

418
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,190
no one knows them there.

419
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,990
No one cares about them.

420
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,890
They are without a soul...

421
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,590
without a name...

422
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,190
without an identity.

423
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,190
I just miss 'em so much.

424
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,090
Oh, shh, pete.It's okay.

425
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:40,590
Look, pete, wherever they are, 
you've got to believe they're happy there.

426
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,090
Like you can speak for doug.

427
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,990
People are mysterious, louise.

428
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,790
I think for doug--

429
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,290
you don't know doug, gene, 
so don't speak for him.

430
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:56,690
I think for doug, the difference between who
he was and who he wanted to be

431
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,290
was maybe more than he could bear.

432
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,490
Pete, are you okay there, sweetheart?

433
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,890
No.Just, um...

434
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,690
we have a bathroom.

435
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,690
For the love of god, pete, 
go relieve yourself.

436
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,490
I mean, what are me and louise gonna do?

437
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,090
Hightail it up in the hills 
the three minutes you're in the john?

438
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,990
We're gonna be right here, sweetheart.

439
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,890
It's okay.You can pee.

440
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,690
I'm so crazy.

441
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,490
Of course, I can pee.

442
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,590
Back, kitchen, take a right.

443
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,790
I'll just be a minute.

444
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,690
What the hell are you trying to do?

445
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,890
It is over.

446
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,690
I am through torturing this poor man.

447
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,690
I'm goin' for the roofies.

448
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,690
No, it is not over.

449
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,890
You've got to think big here.

450
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,890
Oh, no, no, no.

451
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,490
I am tired of thinking big.

452
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,790
It is time to think small.

453
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,590
Oh, would you snap out of it?

454
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,090
No, no, no, no, no.

455
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,790
No, I've got it.

456
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,990
What?What are you talkin' about?

457
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,790
Go get cal.
Get him to dial the house phone.

458
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,490
It's him.

459
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,290
What did she say?

460
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,090
I'm supposed to follow dad and be his shill.

461
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,090
Okay, great, but what's the plan, cal?

462
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,690
I don't know, di.I'm followin' orders.

463
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,990
Well, maybe we don't have to leave,

464
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,490
and I don't have to pull all this shit to the rv.

465
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,690
No, no, don't start thinkin' like that.

466
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,890
You remember what happened in houston.

467
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,690
We got to be ready to leave on a dime.

468
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,690
Hi, there.

469
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,490
Hi.

470
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,190
A lot of garbage.

471
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,290
Yeah.

472
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,090
Yeah, we really love garbage.

473
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,690
It's a bad habit, I guess.

474
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,590
Not even garbage day.

475
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,790
What happened in houston?

476
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,390
- Nothin' happened in houston, ma'am.
- The oil refineries.

477
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,190
Babies.

478
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,290
All right.

479
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,890
Let's get this shit to the rv.

480
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,990
Oh, what rv?

481
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,990
Listen, kiddies, I've seen your rv.

482
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,790
I know where it's parked.

483
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,290
So I can either call security

484
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:44,590
and get into this whole takin'-out-the-garbage- 
on-non-garbage-day business...

485
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,890
or I can come with you and help.

486
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,790
Can you handle her?I got to go.

487
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,190
Damn it, you should have let me 
pick up the phone.

488
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,090
Don't you understand?

489
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,490
We made contact.

490
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,090
Three rings is a code.

491
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,890
Three rings means he's ready, 
do you understand?

492
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,590
Okay, you want to do this?

493
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,590
Well, it's just-- it...it'S...

494
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,390
do you want to do this?

495
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,790
Do you want to go and meet your friend?

496
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,090
We're driving?

497
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,090
You want to walk?

498
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,790
Well, it's just...

499
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:22,390
it's dark out, and I really-- 
I hardly know you.

500
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,390
Pete, that's the point.

501
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,690
You hardly know doug, we hardly know you.

502
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,090
Anyone hardly knows anyone.

503
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,990
What louise means is just relax and trust us.

504
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,990
For god's sake, we trust you.

505
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,590
You're right.

506
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,390
I'm being silly again.

507
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,290
Yeah, you are.

508
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,490
I mean, you peed in the toilet, 
we're all still here, ain't we?

509
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,990
You're right.Come on.

510
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,290
Doug's waiting.

511
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,690
Where are you taking me?

512
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,490
Doug will only meet in a remote spot.

513
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,490
Hey, there, mrs...rich?

514
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,090
- Can I come in?
- No.

515
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,790
I wasn't really askin'.

516
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,090
I was just bein' polite.

517
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,290
Well, come on in, then.

518
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,390
- You want a beer?
- Sure.Thanks.

519
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,890
Look at you, livin' in this fancy house,

520
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,890
but you can't give up your travelin' tricks.

521
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,190
I don't know what you're talkin' about, dale.

522
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,490
Come on.What did you slip in there?

523
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,890
Go on and have a little sip.

524
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,490
You don't want to get on my bad side.

525
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,490
What do you want from us?

526
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,490
They kicked me out, our family.

527
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,390
Took all my money.All they
left me was d...'s pickup truck.

528
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,090
You look like you're doin' fine to me.

529
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,090
Fine is far from it, sweetheart.

530
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,990
Well, what do you want from us, dale?

531
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,590
You know what I want from you, D.

532
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,290
But aside from that, 
I'll take a piece of your pie.

533
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,990
I mean, seriously, what is your angle?

534
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,890
There's no angle, dale.

535
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,690
Bullshit.What is the con?

536
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,590
I mean, I got part of it figured out.

537
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,690
Fake name, phony I.D.

538
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,990
But this house?

539
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,190
How did you score this friggin' place?

540
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,190
And the lawyer gig?

541
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,590
How is wayne spinnin' that?

542
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,290
Well, why don't you ask him?

543
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,390
That is what I'm plannin' to do, mrs.Rich.

544
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,690
He'S...busy.

545
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,290
He ain't gonna be back for a while.

546
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,990
I got all night.

547
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,690
Do you want me to use a coaster?

548
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,690
- Doug?
- Doug!

549
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,690

Where are you?

554
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,090
Who sent you, pete?

555
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,290
W-w-w-what are you talking about?

556
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,390
So how you been, mrs.Rich?

557
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,990
What, you're not talkin' to me now?

558
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,290
Just tryin' to live my life here, dale.

559
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,790
And I am tryin' to be neighborly.

560
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,990
Well, neighbors come and neighbors go.

561
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,090
So why don't you go 'cause I told you wayne 
is not gonna be back here for a while.

562
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,190
And I told you, I am willin' to wait.

563
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,990
I know what you are.

564
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,790
I know why you're here.

565
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,390
I-I-I'm pete.Pete mintzy.

566
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,390
You tell me who sent you, 
or I will put a bullet in your skull.

567
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,990
Gene, I-I-I swear to you.

568
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,790
I have no idea what you're talkin' about.

569
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,090
Just tell me!

570
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,290
Please don't hurt me.

571
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,690
Please don't hurt me.

572
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,990
ABORT MISSION!NOT KILLER!PETE FRIEND!

573
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:18,090
Look!Look, it's from doug!
He's saying I'm innocent!

574
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,690
Look at that!

575
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,690
Doug, it's me!It's pete!
Where are you?

576
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,790
Doug!

577
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,090
Where are you?

578
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,390
Doug!

579
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,090
He's gone.

580
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,290
Gone?

581
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,590
He's afraid.

582
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,690
What are you doin'?

583
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,090
Gonna call the cops to say 
I got intruders in my house.

584
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,490
Your jailbird ass is gonna 
call the cops on me?

585
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,690
You bet.

586
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,390
I'm mrs.Douglas rich.

587
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,290
I'm married to mr.Douglas rich.

588
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,690
I ain't afraid of local cops.Are you?

589
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,690
All right.

590
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,090
Don't get your panties in a bunch.

591
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,990
I don't mean you any harm.

592
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,490
I think what y'all got goin' here is beautiful.

593
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,890
This edenfalls, it's a heaven on earth.

594
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,690
You're wrong, dale.

595
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,190
It ain't heaven on earth.

596
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,390
Will you go, please?

597
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,490
Well, not without a hug, cousin.

598
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,290
You tell that husband of yours 
I'll be back around.

599
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,790
You okay?No broken bones?

600
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,990
What did you mean, who sent me?

601
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,490
What the hell is going on here?

602
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,890
I understand you're upset.

603
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,790
I will explain.

604
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,890
I trust you now.

605
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:20,090
Your friend doug, he witnessed a murder,

606
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,190
a brutal execution that 
no one should have to see.

607
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,990
He was in the wrong place at the wrong time,

608
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,690
but he wanted to do the right thing, 
so he went to the police.

609
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,890
But the trouble was, it was an inside job.

610
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,790
Some bad cops wanted him gone, 
so doug and cherien,

611
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,790
they went on the run.

612
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,390
This is where I come in.

613
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,090
Through contacts, they hired me 
to make the world believe

614
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:50,690
that I was doug rich to lure 
these bastards in,

615
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,590
so I could give them what they deserve.

616
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,790
It's what I do.

617
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,690
I'm what they call a mechanic, pete.

618
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,590
I'm a trained killer.

619
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,990
It's my job.

620
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,790
I have to travel ready for anything.

621
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,690
Sometimes the weapon'll get pretty basic.

622
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,890
It's a job.

623
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,090
Now, I know the truth is difficult to swallow.

624
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,990
Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.

625
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,890
Doug's life is in danger.

626
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,890
He has to remain hidden from everyone, 
even from you.

627
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,690
You understand?

628
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,390
Do you understand?

629
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,690
Now, I'm gonna put you in this car 
and drive you back to your car,

630
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:51,590
and then you go north, 
and you forget this ever happened.

631
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,590
And you wait for doug to contact you 
in his own sweet time.

632
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,990
Now, can you do that, pete?

633
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,190
Good man.

634
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,190
What is that?

635
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,390
Shit.

636
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,190
Nothing.Let's go.

637
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,590
Are you bleeding?

638
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:25,290
No.It's--don't-- it doesn't matter.

639
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,890
It's a water gun.

640
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:40,190
It's a goddamn water gun, you goddamn liar!

641
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,990
You lunatic!What have you done?

642
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,890
look what the cat dragged in.

643
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,090
It almost worked.

644
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,090
Almost does not count, wayne.

645
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,090
Where--lisa?

646
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:09,990
Hi, sweetheart.It's your lisa.Come on.
You want a little wine cooler?

647
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,890
I don't like w----Er.

648
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,390
Yeah, you do.You do.

649
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,890
You like it, okay.

650
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,690
Okay, we got about an hour.

651
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,790
Oh, thank you so much, nina.

652
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,390
I got it from here, okay?

653
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,890
Nonsense.

654
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:32,590
Look, nina, this is all 
just kind of private, okay?

655
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,190
So was my sex life till a week ago.

656
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,390
You know, I have no idea what all of this is.

657
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,590
It's, uh...

658
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,890
So this is where y'all live.

659
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,090
No.No, nina.

660
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,690
We live in the house next door to you.

661
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,590
You know that.

662
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,490
I mean, this is where you come from.

663
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,290
No, nina, we come from tampa.

664
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:56,090
I just--I have no idea who's been in here.

665
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,790
It's just, uh...no, don't touch that!

666
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,390
mexico

667
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,990
you people are really somethin'.

668
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,090
Nina, this is not what you think.

669
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,490
I'm sure of it.

670
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,990
I just mean that it-- 
it's not what it looks like, okay?

671
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,490
Nothin's what it looks like, hon.

672
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,290
Wayne, cal, we got to go!

673
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,290
It's hugh.

674
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,090
We don't have time for hugh.

675
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,290
I got to answer.
He's calling in the middle of the night.

676
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,590
Hey, hey, man, can we talk?

677
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,490
What--hugh, it is four in the morning.

678
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,390
Don't tell me no, doug.

679
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,190
Please don't tell me no, doug.

680
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,290
Okay.She kicked me out.

681
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,190
She locked the doors on me.

682
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,990
Wayne, we got to go!

683
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,090
Uh, we had this fight.I said some stuff.

684
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,990
I called her names.

685
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,790
I hurt her real bad, and...

686
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,090
dad!

687
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,190
Pete is not dead.He is asleep.
We do not have all day.

688
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,090
She said I was the saddest person she ever met.

689
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,490
Said I had no heart.

690
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,990
She didn't mean that.

691
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,990
She was upset.

692
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,690
We're headin' out.

693
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,190
She'll come back.

694
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,590
I don't know.

695
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,190
Hey, man, can you come over?

696
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,390
I need you.

697
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,390
I mean, I'm sittin' here, 
tellin' you I need you.

698
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,090
You're my best friend in the world.

699
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,490
Okay, you're my only friend in the...
in the world.

700
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,690
I'm on my way.

701
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,790
Are you both okay?

702
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,990
Yeah.

703
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,290
Oh, dear lord, what happened to you?

704
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,390
I won't ask.

705
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,590
Oh, nina.

706
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,990
I won't tell.

707
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,090
I know.

708
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,890
I just wish--wish I could come with you.

709
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,890
Nah, you're better off here.

710
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,690
Am I?

711
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,690
Just wish I had the guts.

712
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,090
You do have the guts.

713
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,590
We got to go, ma.

714
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,390
I'll be here if you ever need a helping hand.

715
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,890
I'll be here.

716
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,290
Mr.Rich?

717
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,890
Mrs.Rich?

718
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,090
Is everything okay up there?

00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:26,990

00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,990

723
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,590
You're...

724
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,190
that guy in the truck.

725
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,890
Yeah.I'm a handyman.

726
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,090
Where we gonna go, mexico?

727
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:50,890
I vote canada.

728
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,190
It's too far, di.Come on.

729
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,490
What do you say, baby?

730
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,590
Wherever we go, we got to go right now.

731
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,090
Mexico, it is.

732
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,690
Sorry, di di.I could do with
a margarita.Oh, whatever.

733
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,890
So this, uh, doug and cherien, the riches?

734
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,290
You've known them for years?

735
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,790
They're real?

736
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,590
Or they were.

737
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,690
And these people, whoever they are...

738
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,990
they took over their lives.

739
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:39,390
Information like that, you could 
really hold over somebody's head.

740
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,490
You could use that to get some serious green.

741
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,490
You mean blackmail them?

742
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,890
Are you out of your mind?

743
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,190
I don't want money.
I want my friends.

744
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,590
I got to go to the police 
and have those two arrested.

745
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,390
I have to find out what 
they've done with my friends.

746
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,490
Oh, my god!

747
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,990
What am I doing here?
What's wrong with me?

748
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,090
They're getting away as we speak.

749
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,990
No, they're not goin' anywhere.

750
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,090
Ain't no worry about that.

751
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,790
Distributor cap's gone.

752
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,990
Shit.

753
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,990
Great.What the hell are we gonna do, you guys?

754
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,790
That's got to be dale.

755
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,390
That guy's probably awake by now.

756
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,890
Oh, no, no, no, no.It's okay.It's okay.

757
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,890
It's okay, kids, um...

758
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,690
'cause your dad has a plan.

759
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,190
Yeah.

760
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,390
Great.

761
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,990
I got to go.

762
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,990
Hey, pete?

763
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,090
Let me come with you to the police.

764
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,490
What, are you gonna walk, pete?

765
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,690
I mean, I'm just a handyman,

766
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,490
but it seems to me that the right 
thing to do here is to help,

767
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,190
so let me drive you.

768
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,690
I got a car.You don'T.

769
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,490
Okay.

770
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,290
Thank you.

771
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,190
Yes, drive me.I'm sorry.
I'm not myself.

772
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,590
Who is?

773
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:33,690
You comin'?

774
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,790
Oh, god.

775
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,690
Yeah, pete, I'm comin'.

776
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,190
Let's go for a little stroll.
