ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO): This
concludes our broadcast day.

00:00:26,294 --> 00:00:29,630
We will resume
broadcasting at 5:30 AM.

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,666
Thank you for watching.

00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,869
Hey, Harold.

6
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,305
Harold.

7
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:39,207
Turn that television off.

8
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:46,347
Go away.

9
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:48,882
Don't be ridiculous.

10
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,718
At least turn the channel.

11
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,090
Go away, Mother.

12
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,026
You're dead.

13
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:00,994
Oh, really?

14
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:05,899
Well, you'll never get
anywhere with that attitude.

15
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,369
I'm not listening, Mother.

16
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,741
Hm.

17
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,628
Hitting the hard
stuff, eh, Kunkle?

Once a sissy boy

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,940
Hah, hah, hah.

20
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,309
Now, you've got to drink.

21
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:49,143
Whew hoo!

22
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:50,611
Chug that beer.

Hey, man, you got a light?

24
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,252
Yeah, sure, Jen, no problem.

25
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,188
M-m.

26
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:03,090
Thanks, TJ.

27
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:04,057
No problem.

28
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,064
Now, that is a cigarette.

29
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:14,168
Hey, Kunkle, you
got any pretzels?

30
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:15,569
No.

31
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:19,340
But even if I did have them it
would not make any difference.

32
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,209
You can't eat.

33
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:24,044
You're not alive.

00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,514

Drink it.

00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,588
So I'm dead.

Who's fault is it
anyway, Kunkle?

41
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,596
It's my fault. I
killed all of you.

42
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,498
You ridiculed me.

43
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,400
You beat me.

44
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,769
I couldn't take it anymore.

45
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,138
Ah.

00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,775
I can't.

00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,911
I killed her too.

made fun of me.

Fat Boy Burgers and Fries.

Ooh.

Ah-oh.

said the dreaded F word.

No, it's my cross to bear.

00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,429
I'm going to remain strong

happen while I was gone?

Not a peep.

00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:43,403
He's a weirdo.

87
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:44,672
I know what you mean.

88
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:46,640
I tried to strike up a
conversation with him earlier.

89
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,442
He just stared at me.

90
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:49,610
Maybe he's just shy.

91
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,611
Yeah.

92
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:52,345
Maybe he's just a
backwards weirdo.

93
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:53,681
Should I ask him over?

00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:55,248

out, I'm married.

in Ohio, in Columbus.

I hope he fries.

136
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,229
Did they say how
many he killed?

137

00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:19,099
Makes Manson look
like an upstart.

139

Did he say why he
cut their heads off?

140
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,905
Usual crap.

I say zap him and
be done with it.

one thing for him,

He's certainly an odd bird.

He's a weirdo.

mom with a hatchet.

Emily Dickinson was born in
Amherst, Massachusetts in 1830.

187

Miss Dickinson was
educated at Amherst Academy

188

And she also attended
Mount Holyoke.

189

I think that it's Holyoke.

00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:59,259
The female seminary.

191
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:03,163
Miss Dickinson's family had
been New England residents

192
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:06,466
For a number of years, thus,
their upbringing was highly

193
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:09,502
Religious and Puritanical.

194
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:13,741
Miss Dickinson's supposedly
lived a happy, active, young

195
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:16,944
Life, however, many
accounts report

196
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:19,446
That she soon
suffered an extremely

197
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:22,850
Deep romantic disappointment.

198
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,252
This deep disappointment
may have caused

199
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:28,221
Her to withdraw from society.

200
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:34,227
She thereafter became
a reclusive spinster.

201
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:38,465
Her poetry is highly
personal and extremely vivid,

202
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:42,803
Utilizing such themes as
death, love, and eternal life.

203
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:53,046
Miss Dickinson died in 1886
and her first published work,

204
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,582
"Poems," was
released posthumously

205
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:59,887
Seven years later in the 1893.

206
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:03,523
"Poems, Second Series,"
was released in 1890...

207
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:07,327
Excuse me, Mr. Reynolds.

208
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:09,562
Yes, Thelma.

209
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:19,272
Sorry to interrupt, but
"Poems" was in 1890, not 1893.

210
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:25,946
"Poems, The Second Series,"
was then released in 1891.

211
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:29,482
Just thought that you
would like to know.

212
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,750
Thank you, Thelma.

213
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,786
I certainly trust your work.

214
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:36,256
This source is obviously
a bit fuzzy on the dates.

215
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,826
You're quite the
Dickinson fan, aren't you?

216
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:40,327
Oh, yes.

217
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,395
I just adore her work.

218
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:46,166
She's a personal
heroine of mine.

219
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:50,570
Well, that is certainly
refreshing to hear.

220
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,073
She probably has lesbian
fantasies about her.

221
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:55,342
[Laughter]

222
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,546
Well, Mr. Stone, I
see that something has

223
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:03,516
Tickled your funny bone today.

224
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,517
Yes, sir.

225
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,454
It sure is.

226
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:10,590
Well, perhaps you would
be gracious enough to share

227
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,560
This apparently priceless gag.

228
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,396
Would all of you like to be
entertained by Mr. Stone?

229
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,298
[Laughter]

230
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:22,202
There you are.

231
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:27,074
Please, favor us with your
wit, Jimbo, by popular demand.

232
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:35,348
Well sir, I don't think
you'd find this particular gag

233
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,250
All that funny.

234
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,320
Try me.

235
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:46,026
Well, Matt here was
saying that Thelma probably

236
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:48,695
Has some sort of a
romantic attraction

237
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,697
To this Dickinson lady.

238
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,699
[Laughter]

239
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:04,144
Ah, that's all, sir.

240
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:07,915
That's all, eh?

241
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:11,251
Well, Mr. Stone, since
you and Mr. Douglas

242
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:16,389
Are so taken with Emily
Dickinson's personal life,

243
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:19,626
Well, I'm certain
that the two of you

244
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:24,397
Won't object to the execution
of a 20-page paper on Miss

245
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:27,267
Dickinson's personal life.

246
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,469

Enjoy.

250
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,681
That's all for today.

251
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:46,686
Read Chapter 9 in the green book
and Chapter 4 in the hardback.

252
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:52,359
And Mr. Baldwin, do try
to get some sleep tonight.

253
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:57,164
I know that it's quite
important for you to rock hard,

254
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:59,299
But your snoring is
quite a distraction.

255
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:13,913
Thanks a lot.

256
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,016
But I didn't do anything.

257
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:16,816
Bitch.

258

old record stuck on a groove,

262
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,412
My wretched existence continues.

263
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,017
I eat.

264
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,318
I work.

I eat.

266

and unfulfilling.

271
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,800
It lacks flavor.

272
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:13,240
I find myself more
alienated than ever before.

Grim specters of the past
continue to haunt me.

277

I try to ignore them.

278
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:42,969
I must forget the past, but how
can I when I have no future?

279
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,239
I have come to a decision.

280
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:51,111
If things don't change soon,
I'm going to kill myself.

THELMA (VOICEOVER): Dear
diary, life is hell.

282
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,859
In my last entry,
I shortsightedly

283
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,562
Concluded that my
social status at school

284
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:12,532
Could not get any lower.

285
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:13,966
I was sorely mistaken.

286
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,739
A well-intentioned
bystander apparently

287
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:26,313
Informed Mr. Reynolds about
the confrontation at my locker.

288
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:30,683
He'd get the five
of us after class.

289
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:34,987
He was highly irate.

290
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:38,825
They each received a
two-week detention.

291
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:41,794
Needless to say, they
were quite distressed.

292
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:48,768
I didn't want him to do it.

293
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:53,940
I knew that they would think
that I had told on them.

294
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,476
I don't know what to do.

295
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,412
My mother and father
are still vacationing

296
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,948
And they won't be
back for three weeks.

297
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:07,053
I know that Mr.
Reynolds meant well,

298
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:10,857
But I truly wish that he
would have ignored the matter.

299
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,963
I live in fear of the
inevitable reprisals.

300
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:09,216
I hate them.

301
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,683
I wish they would die.

302
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,057
I am seriously
contemplating suicide.

[Organ music playing]

304
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:53,125
Loneliness is an experience
to which all of us

305
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:56,095
As God's children can relate.

306
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:00,600
On the subject of loneliness,
the great Anglican theologian

307
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,571
CS Lewis once wrote
the following words.

308
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:06,005
"We are born helpless."

309
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:09,609
As soon as we are
fully conscious,

310
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,444
We discover loneliness.

311
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:18,685
We need others, physically,
emotionally, intellectually.

312
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:25,191
"We need them if we are to know
anything, even ourselves."

313
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:28,661
And so by the time
we are but infants,

314
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:35,435
We seek to be in relationship,
with our parents, our families,

315
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:38,938
With God, and with each other.

316
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,975
It has been said that
Christianity is not a religion,

317
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,746
But a relationship and
there is no such thing

318
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:49,582
As a solitary Christian.

00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:17,984
THELMA (VOICEOVER): I
still cannot believe it.

368
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:21,888
My heart is literally
bursting with joy.

369
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:25,124
After a lifetime of
romantic yearnings,

370
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:31,631
I finally find him,
someone like me.

371
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:32,765
I'm in love.

372
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:42,441
Oh, man.

373
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,144
I don't feel like going in.

374
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:47,479
Let's skip for the day.

375
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,447
I'm game if you are.

376
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,949
How about it?

377
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,918
Start the big bash early.

378
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:53,385
No, I can't.

379
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,888
Old man Reynolds passed
by a couple of minutes ago.

380
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:57,189
He'll know we were cutting.

381
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,826
Yeah, and the last thing we
need is another detention.

382
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:03,329
Reynolds has got it
in for all four of us.

383
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:07,867
Ah, it ain't his fault he's
your standard asshole teacher.

384
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:10,436
He's just doing his job.

385
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:12,872
It's the nark's fault.

386
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:15,407
Nasty old nerd woman.

387
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:18,645
Fugly old nerd woman.

388
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:19,779
- That bitch.
- Yeah.

389
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:21,413
Maybe we should stick
a tampon up her ass.

390
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,149
[Laughter]

391
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:25,584
Your old man leave his Jeep?

392
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:26,385
Yep.

393
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:27,486
It's ours till Monday.

394
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,554
Good.

395
00:26:28,655 --> 00:26:31,357
We're going to need
it to haul the kegs.

396
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:33,760
I can taste that brew now.

397
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,428
I'm gonna drink until I...

398
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:37,363
What's wrong?

399
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:39,231
I can't believe it.

400
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:45,705
Fugly found another fugly.

401
00:26:45,805 --> 00:26:47,674
I got an idea.

402
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:51,310
You guys up for some special
entertainment at the party

403
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,111
Tonight?

404
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,046
[Laughter]

405
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:00,452
Thelma.

406
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:01,688
Hi.

407
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:05,524
Look, if you're
here to harass me...

408
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,492
No, really.

409
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:09,028
We're sorry about all that.

410
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:09,829
Yeah.

411
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:11,731
Really sorry.

412
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:15,167
It was Reynolds who gave
us the detention, not you.

413
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:19,205
And well, you know, we
probably deserved it.

414
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:22,574
I didn't tell on you.

415
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:24,944
If I were a snitch,
I'd have informed

416
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:28,147
On you when you shoved me down.

417
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,150
Obviously, I didn't.

418
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:35,354
Well, let's just call it a
big misunderstandings, huh?

419
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,489
We're here to make good.

420
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,292
We really want to
bury the hatchet.

421
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:41,093
Honest.

422
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:49,335
Well, I guess grudge
holding is pretty

423
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:53,639
Unconstructive
especially if it was

424
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,908
Just a slight misunderstanding.

425
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,010
Well, I sure feel better now.

426
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,046
We felt awfully bad.

427
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:01,580
I feel better too.

428
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,682
I know I don't have very
much in common with you

429
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:06,919
Two or anyone else in the
school for that matter,

430
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,822
But I hate conflicts.

431
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:11,457
Well hey, we just
have to get to know

432
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:12,959
Each other a little bit better.

433
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,094
That's all.

434
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:18,430
But we've been in school
together for nearly four years.

435
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,499
Why all of a sudden...

436
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:23,736
Look, everybody has to
grow up sometime, right?

437
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:25,805
Well, we're going to
be graduating soon.

438
00:28:25,905 --> 00:28:30,476
Let's just say it's our turn
to do a little maturing.

439
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:31,310
OK.

440
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,081
We'll let bygones be bygones.

441
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:36,348
Hey.

442
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,517
Matt's parents are out
of town and he's having

443
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:40,186
A really big party tonight.

444
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:41,553
Why don't you stop by?

445
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,255
Oh, I don't know.

446
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:45,457
I already made plans
with my boyfriend.

447
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,594
Oh, so you have a boyfriend.

448
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:50,562
Well, why don't you
bring him along too.

449
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:56,735
I don't know, Harold.

450
00:28:56,836 --> 00:28:59,972
They certainly seemed sincere.

451
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,108
Ah, I don't know either.

452
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:06,178
This sudden repentance
seems a bit suspect.

453
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:07,847
I suppose so.

454
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:12,451
Oh, but it would be so
nice if it were genuine.

455
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:15,988
I've been in these
situations before.

456
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:19,658
Besides, they probably
want to ridicule us.

457
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,161
I don't think so, Harold.

458
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:25,331
Oh, I'm so happy now
that I'm with you.

459
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:28,467
I think that they
can sense that.

460
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:31,137
And it is the end
of high school.

461
00:29:31,237 --> 00:29:35,274
I'd so love to have
it end on a good note.

462
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:36,108
Yes.

463
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,044
Yes.

464
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:39,245
We can go.

465
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:41,547
We could always go home early.

466
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:43,415
Oh, wonderful.

467
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:44,650
Oh, thank you, Harold.

468
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,619
I'm so excited.

469
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:53,025
The... the party starts at 10:00,
but maybe we should be... oh,

470
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:56,162
What do the hip people call it?

471
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:58,697
Fashionably late.

472
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,900
Sure.

473
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,735
So pick me up around 11:00.

474
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:08,007
Oh, I can't wait
to show you off.

475
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:08,941
Great.

476
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,509
See you at 11:00 then.

477
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:13,345
Oh, wonderful.

478
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:15,247
I love you, Harold.

479
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:16,182
I love you too.

480
00:30:16,282 --> 00:30:16,983
Good bye.

481
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:48,780
(SINGING) He don't even care
the telephone is ringing.

482
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:52,784
Turns up the radio and
pretends that he's singing.

483
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:56,288
Another tune comes on and
says, dang, it's Elvis.

484
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:59,258
Jumps up like a
hound dog, starts

485
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,260
Shaking his pelvis around.

486
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:18,744
She don't even
care. [Inaudible].

487
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:22,714
Pulls on her high-heal shoes
and rolls up her stockings.

488
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:26,218
Shakes a lollipop right out
of her pocket, unwraps it,

489
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:29,455
Licks it once and
then she starts

490
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:32,691
To suck it, suck it, suck it.

491
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:51,177
Go ahead oh, minute man, say I
can't understand why things are

492
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:55,647
Happening, why things are
happening, so I don't even try,

493
00:31:55,747 --> 00:32:00,152
Don't stop to wonder why when
she says she's going home.

494
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:06,858
So then he gives lip to me.

495
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:09,561
That was his first mistake.

496
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:12,198
The second mistake was when he
thought he could take me down.

497
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:14,200
I mean, can you
believe this guy?

498
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,636
Of course, I'm too
quick for his sorry ass.

499
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:22,574
I block his punch,
then I pop him one.

500
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,044
I think that I broke his nose.

501
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:28,014
He's lucky I didn't
break his neck.

502
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:30,516
Nah, I was there.

503
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:32,318
It wasn't that way at all.

504
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:34,186
Man.

505
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:35,187
Come on, nothing.

506
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,288
You're full of shit.

507
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:37,089
He hit you.

508
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:38,490
You hit the ground.

509
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,392
Why you gotta dog me, man?

510
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:41,994
I gotta talk trash.

511
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:43,529
You calling me a liar?

512
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:44,363
Ah, man.

513
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:45,197
Come on, man.

514
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:45,998
Cool out.

515
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:48,367
I ain't no liar.

516
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,269
I'm just talking.

517
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:51,637
You're full of shit, man.

518
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:52,638
You're an asshole.

519
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:53,439
[Inaudible].

520
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:54,540
Damn straight.

521
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:00,246
Cause I'm gonna kick
your lying, candy ass.

522
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:04,216
(SINGING) Ah, Ah, Ah.

523
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,719
Ah, Ah, Ah.

524
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,222
Ah, Ah, Ah.

525
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:19,598
So are you gonna
spend the night?

526
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:21,033
I'd like to.

527
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:22,501
I want to if I can.

528
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,373
I'll call home around midnight.

529
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:29,808
I'll tell my parents
I'm staying at Marzie's.

530
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:31,210
Of course, she'll
tell her parents

531
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,278
She's staying at my house.

532
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:34,480
But you'll both be
here, wantonly engaging

533
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,183
In reckless, premarital sex.

534
00:33:37,283 --> 00:33:38,517
You got it.

535
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:40,986
(SINGING) I can't understand
why things are happening,

536
00:33:41,087 --> 00:33:42,988
Why things are happening.

537
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:46,958
So I don't even try,
don't stop to wonder why,

538
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:48,927
[Inaudible] going on.

539
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:57,403
We were going to scrap
and all, but I let him go.

540
00:33:57,503 --> 00:33:59,371
He's drunk.

541
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:01,873
I'm feeling mighty
generous tonight.

542
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:04,676
You're looking very
hot this evening.

543
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:07,579
What do say we blow this
Popsicle stand and...

544
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,515
[Doorbell rings]

545
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:11,583
Door bell.

546
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:12,384
Screw them.

547
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:14,120
Am I the gatekeeper?

548
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,356
How's about you and
I taking a little...

549
00:34:17,456 --> 00:34:18,724
[Doorbell rings]

550
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:19,758
You'd better get it.

551
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:21,893
I don't think anyone
else can hear it.

552
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,362
Ah, man.

553
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:25,364
[Doorbell rings]

554
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:27,633
Enough already.

555
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,034
Hello.

556
00:34:29,135 --> 00:34:31,069
Is this Matt Douglas' house?

557
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,037
We're here for the party.

558
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:43,949
Hiya, Thelma.

559
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:46,152
Hello.

560
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:48,187
Hiya, Thel.

561
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:49,555
Hello, Jimbo.

562
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:55,261
So I take it this is your
so called significant other.

563
00:34:55,361 --> 00:34:58,597
It certainly is.

564
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:03,001
He's the light of my life.

565
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:03,902
Oh.

566
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:06,372
How sweet.

567
00:35:06,472 --> 00:35:09,875
Harold, this is Marzie.

568
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:11,343
Hiya.

569
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,845
Please to meet
your acquaintance.

570
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,348
And this is Jimbo.

571
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:17,549
How ya doin' man?

572
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:18,350
Fine.

573
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,352
Nice to meet you.

574
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:23,255
Let's go upstairs
to freshen up.

575
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:30,962
Harold, I'll be right back.

576
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:35,367
Say, Harold, do
you like to drink?

577
00:35:38,904 --> 00:35:42,241
Oh, it was nice of
you to ask us to come.

578
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:44,410
Oh, sure.

579
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,211
Oh.

580
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:47,145
Hi, Thelma.

581
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:48,146
Hello.

582
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:49,781
Oh, you look nice.

583
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:50,582
Thanks.

584
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:52,551
I'm a little tipsy.

585
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,986
My eyes are probably blood shot.

586
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:55,787
Oh, no.

587
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:57,155
You both look wonderful.

588
00:35:57,256 --> 00:36:01,493
Ah, you're sweet.

589
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:04,196
I wish I was pretty.

590
00:36:04,296 --> 00:36:06,332
I know that I'm not.

591
00:36:06,432 --> 00:36:08,434
Ooh, I wouldn't say that.

592
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:09,235
Yeah.

593
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:12,604
You ain't that homely.

594
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:15,874
You just need a little
jazzing up, that's all.

595
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:19,077
But my hair is horrible.

596
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,313
My... it isn't that great either.

597
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:24,650
I've accepted it.

598
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,918
I am homely.

599
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:31,122
A little makeup can do wonders,
even for a bad complexion.

600
00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:33,992
And why do you think
God invented extra body

601
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:37,195
Gel and styling spritz.

602
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:39,798
I... I appreciate
the interest, but I

603
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:42,801
Never use those vanity things.

604
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:45,337
I wouldn't know where to start.

605
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:48,507
Hey, that's what
friends are for.

606
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:49,975
Marz, get your purse.

607
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:51,176
Whew.

608
00:36:51,277 --> 00:36:53,078
I'm going to give you
the makeover of your life.

609
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:53,912
No.

610
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:56,214
Now, you... you don't have to.

611
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:59,017
No, we don't, but we want to.

612
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:00,252
Oh, but I'd feel bad.

613
00:37:00,352 --> 00:37:03,054
Harold is down there by
himself and he's really shy.

614
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:04,456
Oh, don't worry about him.

615
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:05,857
He's a big boy.

616
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:09,295
I'm sure Matt and Jimbo
will take good care of him.

617
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:10,762
(CHANTING) Slam it!

618
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:11,730
Slam it!

619
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:12,531
Slam it!

620
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:13,532
Slam it!

621
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:14,500
Slam it!

622
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,101
Slam it!
Aw!

623
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:16,968
Slam it!

624
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,437
Slam it!

625
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:19,438
Slam it!

626
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:20,406
Slam it!

627
00:37:20,506 --> 00:37:21,407
Slam it!

628
00:37:21,507 --> 00:37:22,408
Slam it!

629
00:37:22,508 --> 00:37:23,375
Slam it!

630
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:24,376
Slam it!

631
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:25,344
Slam it!

632
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:26,345
Slam it!

633
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:27,313
Slam it!

634
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:28,580
Whew!

635
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,381
Man...

636
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:31,483
(GROUP) He slammed it!

637
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:32,284
Whew!

638
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,223
There's more where
that came from.

639
00:37:38,324 --> 00:37:39,691
(GROUP) Yeah!

640
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:41,159
Slam it!

641
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,127
Slam it!

642
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:43,595
Slam it!

643
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:44,830
Slam it!

644
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:45,631
Slam it!

645
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:47,098
Slam it!
Slam it!

646
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:47,999
Slam it!

647
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,234
Slam it!

648
00:37:49,335 --> 00:37:50,035
Slam it!

649
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:51,403
Slam it!

650
00:37:51,503 --> 00:37:55,641
Ooh, it sounds like they're
having a grand time downstairs.

651
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:59,277
Yeah, but not nearly as much
fun as we are having up here.

652
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:03,615
Oh, yes.

653
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:06,752
We're coming along just fine.

654
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:08,787
[Laughter]

655
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:50,228
Well, I must say, we've
certainly outdone ourselves.

656
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,029
Yeah.

657
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:53,198
A regular work of art.

658
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:55,100
Oh, I'm so excited.

659
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,002
Do you have a mirror?

660
00:38:57,102 --> 00:38:58,169
Ah, no.

661
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:01,973
But there's one downstairs
in the living room.

662
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:03,074
Yeah.

663
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,644
You'll surprise your
boyfriend on the way.

664
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:06,612
Wonderful.

665
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:08,780
I hope that he
notices the change.

666
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,750
Oh, believe me, he'll notice.

667
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,252
[Laughter]

668
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:40,712
Wonderful pig feet.

669
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:45,684
I'd really like to thank
you for inviting us.

670
00:39:45,784 --> 00:39:48,687
I feel like I really belong.

671
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:51,189
Oh, think nothing of it.

672
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:52,691
It was our pleasure.

673
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:54,192
You like me.

674
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:56,161
You really like me.

675
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:58,163
[Giggling]

676
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:05,671
Stop it!

677
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,616
[Laughter]

678
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:23,121
What's so funny?

679
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:25,123
[Laughter]

680
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:31,096
What's so funny?

681
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:34,600
Take a look in
the mirror, Fugly.

682
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:45,276
We buried the
hatchet, all right.

683
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,077
Yeah.

684
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:48,079
Right through her ugly head.

685
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:51,049
[Laughter]

686
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:23,982
Ah.

687
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:27,686
I feel sick.

688
00:41:27,786 --> 00:41:30,255
I'm sorry, Harold.

689
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:35,594
It's my fault. You
warned me but, no, I

690
00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:39,097
Was the foolish
optimist, always the

691
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:42,467
Idealistic, foolish optimist.

692
00:41:42,568 --> 00:41:44,603
Something's wrong with me.

693
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:46,004
I see red.

694
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,742
Do you like it?

695
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:55,581
I got one of the red bulbs
from my father's dark room.

696
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:59,284
Red suits my mood this evening.

697
00:41:59,384 --> 00:42:02,888
It's my new favorite color.

698
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:10,896
Red is the color of blood,
the color of revenge.

699
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:12,463
I don't understand.

700
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:17,235
Of all people, you should know.

701
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:19,971
What do you mean by that?

702
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:24,342
You talk in your sleep, dear.

703
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:30,616
The ones who picked on you,
the ones who ridiculed you,

704
00:42:30,716 --> 00:42:33,952
You killed them.

705
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,788
I know all about it.

706
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:37,789
Please.

707
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,024
I don't know what you're...

708
00:42:39,124 --> 00:42:43,962
I'm not going to tell on you.

709
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:50,135
I love you, now and forever.

710
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:51,236
Let me explain.

711
00:42:51,336 --> 00:42:55,607
You don't need to
explain, my love.

712
00:42:55,707 --> 00:42:58,043
I'm proud of you.

713
00:42:58,143 --> 00:43:01,947
I'm glad that you did it.

714
00:43:02,047 --> 00:43:05,550
And you're going to do it again.

715
00:43:05,651 --> 00:43:08,053
No.

716
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:11,089
Yes, you are.

717
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:15,326
And I'm going to help you.

718
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:18,363
Now, I want to know
all the details.

719
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:25,236
Tell me how you did it.

720
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:28,106
Tell me how you murdered them.

721
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:46,658
Johnny, nothing
below the waist.

722
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:47,893
Oh, come on, Frankie.

723
00:43:47,993 --> 00:43:50,495
We've already done
everything but.

724
00:43:50,595 --> 00:43:54,399
Well, I just don't want you to
think I'm some sort of sleaze.

725
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:56,634
I don't like to go all the way
until at least the third date.

726
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:02,841
Look, look, last Friday night
we were both at the victory

727
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:04,475
Dance, right?

728
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:05,410
Ooh, yeah.

729
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:08,780
And we slow danced
together, right?

730
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,648
Yeah, I guess so.

731
00:44:10,749 --> 00:44:12,250
And then Saturday,
we were at Muzzy

732
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:13,184
Lake drinking with the gang.

733
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:14,152
Right?

734
00:44:14,252 --> 00:44:16,187
Yeah, but we weren't
really together.

735
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:17,188
Yeah.

736
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:18,523
Sure we were.

737
00:44:18,623 --> 00:44:22,493
So technically speaking,
that was a date too.

738
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:25,430
I guess it could have been.

739
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:26,698
OK.

740
00:44:26,798 --> 00:44:31,102
So again, technically
speaking, that would make this

741
00:44:31,202 --> 00:44:34,505
Our third date, right?

742
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,908
M-m.

743
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,643
Well, I have to think about it.

744
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:42,848
OK.

745
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:50,756
But make sure you pull
out before you do it.

746
00:44:50,856 --> 00:44:51,556
Hey, no problem.

747
00:44:51,656 --> 00:44:55,126
I believe in safe sex too.

748
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:56,995
[Pebble sounds]

749
00:44:58,496 --> 00:45:01,867
What the hell.

750
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:04,936
Sounds like hale.

751
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:05,737
Hale my ass.

752
00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:06,637
Someone's throwing rocks.

753
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:13,144
It's that asshole Tom Birch.

754
00:45:13,244 --> 00:45:15,446
I'll have my foot
so far up his ass,

755
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,714
He'll be tasting shoe leather.

756
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:28,159
I'll show you at the court.

757
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:32,197
Bare you for ornaments
where women breathe.

758
00:45:32,297 --> 00:45:37,435
That every sigh may lift you
just as high as I and when

759
00:45:37,535 --> 00:45:42,040
I die, I make a
way to sleigh you,

760
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:45,376
Still to show how rich I go.

761
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:49,280
The skies in peach and
wealth so wonderful.

762
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,548
And banish me.

763
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,254
Oh.

764
00:45:56,354 --> 00:45:58,656
Hello, Johnny.

765
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:06,798
Fancy meeting you here.

766
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,238
Welcome to hell.

767
00:46:13,338 --> 00:46:16,274
Man, you are one weird bitch.

768
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:17,075
Ah!

769
00:46:19,945 --> 00:46:23,982
We've known each
other for a long time,

770
00:46:24,082 --> 00:46:25,616
Ever since elementary school.

771
00:46:28,386 --> 00:46:31,089
You've never been civil to me.

772
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:32,090
Hey... hey come on.

773
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:40,999
Do you remember the
eighth grade band banquet?

774
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:46,004
What you called me in
front of every one?

775
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:52,743
Mother and Father thought
I was too young to shave

776
00:46:52,844 --> 00:46:56,647
My legs and armpits.

777
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:57,983
I couldn't help it.

778
00:46:58,083 --> 00:47:01,586
They wouldn't let me.

779
00:47:01,686 --> 00:47:03,188
We were at the banquet.

780
00:47:06,191 --> 00:47:09,260
Everything was quiet.

781
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:17,535
Then you shouted, Hap, H-A-P,
short for hairy armpits,

782
00:47:17,635 --> 00:47:18,569
In front of everyone.

783
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:23,474
Everyone laughed.

784
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:24,675
I cried.

785
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:27,245
But that wasn't enough for you.

786
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:34,953
You threw disposable razors
at me in front of everyone.

787
00:47:35,053 --> 00:47:40,825
But hey, I'm willing to
let bygones be bygones.

788
00:47:44,129 --> 00:47:46,697
[Laughter]

789
00:47:48,133 --> 00:47:49,534
Hey.

790
00:47:49,634 --> 00:47:53,071
I'm going to give you
your just desserts.

791
00:47:57,075 --> 00:48:01,312
I always wanted to know
what oral sex was like.

792
00:48:01,412 --> 00:48:05,683
I don't have the gag
reflexes like you.

793
00:48:05,783 --> 00:48:08,186
No.

794
00:48:08,286 --> 00:48:08,987
Oh, god.

795
00:48:09,087 --> 00:48:09,988
Stop.

796
00:48:10,088 --> 00:48:10,788
Please.

797
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:16,194
Freak bitch.

798
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:16,995
Easy.

799
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,905
Oh, I'm sorry.

800
00:48:28,006 --> 00:48:30,841
I must have done it wrong.

801
00:48:30,942 --> 00:48:31,642
Ah!

802
00:48:36,681 --> 00:48:39,017
Harold, shush him.

803
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:49,294
Splendidly done, Harold.

804
00:48:49,394 --> 00:48:52,397
What you did, did you enjoy it?

805
00:48:52,497 --> 00:48:56,201
Oh, Harold, you're jealous.

806
00:48:56,301 --> 00:48:58,970
Don't worry, you're much bigger.

807
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:00,938
[Laughter]

808
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:15,620
Men, who needs 'em?

809
00:49:25,096 --> 00:49:30,635
(SIGHING) Well, there's
always Mr. Hand.

810
00:49:42,447 --> 00:49:43,148
Ooh.

811
00:49:47,152 --> 00:49:49,687
Ah.

812
00:49:49,787 --> 00:49:50,488
M-m.

813
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:54,359
Ah.

814
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:56,594
[Inaudible].

815
00:49:56,694 --> 00:50:00,098
Caught you with your
hand in the cookie jar.

816
00:50:00,198 --> 00:50:02,433
Thelma.

817
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:10,608
You're nothing but a stupid,
danged, air-headed fluff chick.

818
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:13,311
You think you're so pretty.

819
00:50:13,411 --> 00:50:16,914
You with your big
breasts and clear skin,

820
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:20,285
You probably never
even had a zit.

821
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:23,588
I'm going to slice you up.

822
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:25,390
No.

823
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:27,625
No!

824
00:50:27,725 --> 00:50:33,431
And then, I'm
going to pee on you.

825
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,300
[Screaming]

826
00:50:39,904 --> 00:50:42,240
[Laughter]

827
00:50:49,914 --> 00:50:50,615
Hey.

828
00:50:53,651 --> 00:50:55,052
Hey.

829
00:50:55,153 --> 00:50:56,020
Hey!

830
00:50:56,121 --> 00:50:58,523
(TOGETHER) What?

831
00:50:58,623 --> 00:50:59,957
The old bitch from
next door just called.

832
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,960
She got pissed about the
noise and she called the cops.

833
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:03,761
Bull shit!

834
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:04,995
Come on.

835
00:51:05,096 --> 00:51:06,997
We gotta clear out of here.

836
00:51:07,098 --> 00:51:07,965
Oh, man.

837
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,935
I just bought a whole
bottle of vodka.

838
00:51:11,035 --> 00:51:12,437
We'll drink it later.

839
00:51:12,537 --> 00:51:15,406
I'm just getting
comfortable, man.

840
00:51:15,506 --> 00:51:16,407
Let's go.

841
00:51:34,525 --> 00:51:35,360
Boo.

842
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,161
Damn.

843
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:37,027
[Giggling]

844
00:51:37,128 --> 00:51:38,296
Don't do that.

845
00:51:38,396 --> 00:51:41,366
Oh, what's the matter, did
I frighten the little man?

846
00:51:41,466 --> 00:51:42,400
Look.

847
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,069
That's not a corpse,
that's Tom Birch.

848
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:47,472
He passed out about an hour ago.

849
00:51:47,572 --> 00:51:49,740
Not dead, unfortunately,
just wasted.

850
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,809
Scared the hell outta me.

851
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:53,411
For a minute there,
I thought those nerds

852
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:54,612
Came back for revenge.

853
00:51:54,712 --> 00:51:55,646
Oh, that'll be the day.

854
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:03,821
Matt, I told Rachael she
could spend the night, OK?

855
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:04,622
What the hell.

856
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:06,524
The more, the merrier.

857
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:09,660
We've already got
one uninvited guest.

858
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,461
Great.

859
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:11,296
She's taking a shower.

860
00:53:00,578 --> 00:53:02,547
[Screaming]

861
00:53:02,647 --> 00:53:03,714
Whew, whew, whew.

862
00:53:03,814 --> 00:53:05,816
[Screaming]

863
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:07,752
[Laughter]

864
00:53:12,089 --> 00:53:12,790
You're an asshole.

865
00:53:15,993 --> 00:53:17,061
It was just a joke.

866
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:17,862
Asshole.

867
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,102
I thought you were KO-ed.

868
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,404
I was.

869
00:53:26,504 --> 00:53:29,540
I got better.

870
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,009
Well, I don't care if
you spend the night.

871
00:53:32,109 --> 00:53:34,011
I do.

872
00:53:34,111 --> 00:53:36,347
Just keep it down, OK?

873
00:53:36,447 --> 00:53:37,448
No problem.

874
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,450
You're a great guy, Matt.

875
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:40,551
Whatever.

876
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:41,686
I'm going to bed.

877
00:53:44,622 --> 00:53:48,259
By the way, you've
got a nice beaver.

878
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:50,194
MRS. JOHNSON (ON
PHONE): [inaudible].

879
00:53:50,295 --> 00:53:51,662
I don't know Mrs. Johnson.

880
00:53:51,762 --> 00:53:53,364
MRS. JOHNSON (ON
PHONE): [inaudible].

881
00:53:53,464 --> 00:53:54,599
Yes.

882
00:53:54,699 --> 00:53:56,934
Lucy was at the party,
but she left with Jack

883
00:53:57,034 --> 00:53:58,168
Walker and another couple.

884
00:53:58,269 --> 00:53:59,504
MRS. JOHNSON (ON
PHONE): Jack Walker?

885
00:53:59,604 --> 00:54:01,739
What do you think
they're doing now?

886
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,708
Calm down, Mrs. Johnson.

887
00:54:03,808 --> 00:54:05,242
MRS. JOHNSON (ON PHONE):
Was there drinking?

888
00:54:05,343 --> 00:54:06,110
Oh, no.

889
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:07,778
There was no booze at the party.

890
00:54:07,878 --> 00:54:09,914
MRS. JOHNSON (ON PHONE): And
they probably had some pot.

891
00:54:10,014 --> 00:54:10,715
No.

892
00:54:10,815 --> 00:54:11,982
No pot either.

893
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,251
Look, lady, I don't need...

894
00:54:17,355 --> 00:54:18,756
What's wrong?

895
00:54:18,856 --> 00:54:20,391
That's weird.

896
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:21,926
The phone went dead.

897
00:54:25,496 --> 00:54:27,865
[Laughter]

898
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:34,539
I hate that Dick.

899
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:37,074
Everyone hates Tom.

900
00:54:37,174 --> 00:54:40,077
Then what's he doing here?

901
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:41,746
Matt's too nice of a guy.

902
00:54:41,846 --> 00:54:44,515
He can't say no.

903
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:45,883
Hurry up and finish.

904
00:54:45,983 --> 00:54:50,120
I'm drunk and I'm horny.

905
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,624
You're always horny.

906
00:54:53,724 --> 00:54:54,759
Beer makes me horny.

907
00:54:54,859 --> 00:54:56,794
Let's go to bed.

908
00:54:56,894 --> 00:55:00,064
Maybe we won't be
disturbed this time.

909
00:55:00,164 --> 00:55:02,967
We'd better not be
disturbed or that Tom

910
00:55:03,067 --> 00:55:09,139
Birch is going to be one
sorry... was that the front door?

911
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:11,075
Maybe Matt's
putting his cat out.

912
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:12,943
Let's go to bed.

913
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:14,345
All right.

914
00:55:14,445 --> 00:55:16,213
All right.

915
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,649
But I forewarn you, I may
be too drunk to get it up.

916
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,576
Tom?

917
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:49,079
Don't you ever
learn, little boy?

918
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:53,083
You deserve a good,
swift kick in the balls.

919
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,052

921
00:56:10,568 --> 00:56:12,537
There he goes again.

922
00:56:12,637 --> 00:56:14,104
I should have known
better than to let Birch

923
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,606
The butt hole spend the night.

924
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:18,042
[Screaming]

925
00:56:22,947 --> 00:56:29,820
By the way, you've
got nice beaver.

926
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,321
Hi, honey.

927
00:56:31,422 --> 00:56:32,990
I'm home.

928
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:34,759
Where's the Beaver?

929
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:36,561
[Laughter]

930
00:56:37,928 --> 00:56:42,967
Ward, you were a little
hard in my beaver last night.

931
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:44,869
[Laughter]

932
00:56:52,643 --> 00:56:54,111
All right, asshole.

933
00:56:54,211 --> 00:56:56,714
Once just wasn't enough, was it?

934
00:56:56,814 --> 00:56:57,548
Huh?

935
00:56:57,648 --> 00:56:59,517
Man, what are you talking about?

936
00:56:59,617 --> 00:57:04,154
You know goddamned well
what I'm talking about, man.

937
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,891
I heard you laughing
like a goon upstairs.

938
00:57:06,991 --> 00:57:11,929
Look, I'm warning you,
you leave Rachael alone.

939
00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:14,398
Man, I don't know where
you're coming from.

940
00:57:14,499 --> 00:57:17,334
Look, I... I'll
spell it out for you.

941
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,536
I don't like you.

942
00:57:18,636 --> 00:57:19,804
Nobody likes you.

943
00:57:19,904 --> 00:57:22,473
You're slimy, whiny
little jerk off

944
00:57:22,573 --> 00:57:26,911
And if I catch you bugging her
again, your ass is grassed.

945
00:57:27,011 --> 00:57:30,014
Do I make myself clear?

946
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:30,948
Yeah.

947
00:57:31,048 --> 00:57:32,116
Sure.

948
00:57:32,216 --> 00:57:33,017
Whatever.

949
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:35,319
Do I need to elaborate?

950
00:57:35,419 --> 00:57:39,056
I think I get the general idea
of what you're trying to say.

951
00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:40,357
Good.

952
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,259
See that you do.

953
00:57:51,435 --> 00:57:55,239
What is this, pick
on Tom Birch night?

954
00:57:55,339 --> 00:57:57,207
Damn.

955
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,810
Big Shit is lucky I
didn't pop him one.

956
00:58:03,347 --> 00:58:07,484
Might as well make myself
at home, especially

957
00:58:07,585 --> 00:58:09,219
Since I'm so well liked.

958
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:24,134
Well, they can all
hang for all I care.

959
00:58:28,372 --> 00:58:29,073
Ouch.

960
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:43,988
Dear Stud, you are totally hot.

961
00:58:44,088 --> 00:58:47,658
I've been playing hard
to get, but a girl has

962
00:58:47,758 --> 00:58:50,861
To do what a girl has to do.

963
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:55,265
Come upstairs right now
for some hot booty love?

964
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:58,703
I'm in the room
with the water bed.

965
00:58:58,803 --> 00:59:00,938
Lets start some waves?

966
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:04,008
Love, Rachael.

967
00:59:04,108 --> 00:59:06,510
I knew she wanted me.

968
00:59:14,118 --> 00:59:16,520
Hey, Rachael.

969
00:59:16,621 --> 00:59:18,322
Come on in, big boy.

970
00:59:23,628 --> 00:59:26,864
I see that you got my note.

971
00:59:26,964 --> 00:59:30,167
You know it, babe.

972
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:34,805
I was naked, but I didn't
want to get you too excited

973
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:37,574
All at once.

974
00:59:37,675 --> 00:59:40,745
So I found a special
dress in the closet.

975
00:59:40,845 --> 00:59:44,715
I thought that you
could slowly strip me.

976
00:59:44,815 --> 00:59:47,184
Would you like to
take off my dress?

977
00:59:47,284 --> 00:59:48,185
Would I?

978
00:59:51,722 --> 00:59:57,327
You'd probably like to massage
my breasts too, wouldn't you?

979
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,128
Sure.

980
01:00:00,765 --> 01:00:03,067
Then come here.

981
01:00:03,167 --> 01:00:06,236
Make me wet.

982
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:09,239
I hope that you like
my special dress.

983
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:14,211
Don't worry, babe, it
ain't going to be on long.

984
01:00:14,311 --> 01:00:16,180
Do you like it?

985
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,183
It's a wedding dress.

986
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:22,586
The year book voted me most
likely to never get married

987
01:00:22,687 --> 01:00:25,255
And you were the editor.

988
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:27,992
Hey, you ain't Rachael.

989
01:00:28,092 --> 01:00:31,595
You're that fugly nerd.

990
01:00:31,696 --> 01:00:36,600
You know, Tom, you
really are an asshole.

991
01:00:36,701 --> 01:00:38,102
Get him, Harold!

992
01:00:38,202 --> 01:00:39,103
Get him!

993
01:00:39,203 --> 01:00:41,071
Get him!

995
01:00:46,844 --> 01:00:47,544
Oh.

996
01:00:50,614 --> 01:00:51,782
What was that?

997
01:00:51,882 --> 01:00:54,985
I don't know.

998
01:00:55,085 --> 01:00:56,887
Oh, shit.

999
01:00:56,987 --> 01:01:00,490
I forgot to take
out my contacts.

1000
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:02,626
Ah, they're stuck to my eyes.

1001
01:01:02,727 --> 01:01:05,162
I'm going to have
to get some saline.

1002
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:06,130
Hurry up.

1003
01:01:18,843 --> 01:01:22,279
Hey, this isn't the bathroom.

1004
01:01:22,379 --> 01:01:23,948
[Muffled sounds]

1005
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,924
Set her down over there.

1006
01:01:38,495 --> 01:01:41,398
Tie her nice and tight, Harold.

1007
01:01:41,498 --> 01:01:45,870
It wouldn't do if I should
slip while I'm giving

1008
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:48,638
Her her nice, new haircut.

1009
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:59,283
Marz?

1010
01:01:59,383 --> 01:02:00,084
Marz?

1011
01:02:07,825 --> 01:02:08,525
Thirsty.

1012
01:02:11,628 --> 01:02:14,131
Oh, that's much better.

1013
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:16,533
Doesn't she look
wonderful, Harold?

1014
01:02:19,603 --> 01:02:23,673
Oh, she looks lovely.

1015
01:02:23,774 --> 01:02:27,177
I must say, it's a
definite improvement.

1016
01:02:29,914 --> 01:02:30,614
Voila, Madam.

1017
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:43,393
Aw, she does not lie her new do.

1018
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:47,197
Well, I guess I did
miss a few spots,

1019
01:02:47,297 --> 01:02:51,368
But I know just the
thing to clean her up.

1020
01:02:51,468 --> 01:02:52,169

to do the honors?

No.

1026
01:03:08,752 --> 01:03:10,420
I could... I would
hate to infringe

1027
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,822
On your consortial talent.

1028
01:03:11,922 --> 01:03:13,257
Oh.

1029
01:03:13,357 --> 01:03:16,626
All right, I'll
finish her up then.

1030
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:19,129
Well, Marzie, it
looks like we're going

1031
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:21,731
To bury the hatchet after all.

1032
01:03:24,701 --> 01:03:27,972

That asshole, Birch.

1035
01:03:37,014 --> 01:03:39,884
He's probably busy
looting the place.

1036
01:04:04,274 --> 01:04:05,675
I knew it.

1037
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:15,819
All right, Birch, you
better have hands clean.

1038
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,721
Otherwise, it's judgment day.

1039

off the other two.
