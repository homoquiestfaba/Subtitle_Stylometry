who's buying all those gifts.

you're not getting any gifts.

Her lashes.

113

Her desire to kill me right now.

114
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,194

We were just trying to be polite.

124
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,351
Get your narrow behinds over here

125
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,228
and help me get these groceries
to the shelter.

126

Oh, yeah. [chuckles] I almost forgot
how cute it looked on me.

129
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,613
It's for the homeless.

130
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,116
But it has my name on it.

131
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:28,369
Nobody's gonna want to wear this,
unless their name is Jade.

132

00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,687
-I borrowed them.
-Stole.

176
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,230
-Borrowed.
-Stole.

177
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,565
Did you ask me to wear them?

178
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,108
-I...
-Stole 'em.

179
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,025
[stammers]

180
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,155
Okay, okay. Oh, remember the time you...

181
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,825
what, stopped speaking to me
for about a year-and-a-half

182
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,910
because I used some brochure
to kill a fly.

183
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,620
That was not a brochure.

184
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,665
That was Ernestine Brown's
funeral program.

185
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,917
Girl, you didn't even like Ernestine.

186
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,462
But I loved her program!

187
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:46,174
She looked like a young Cicely Tyson.

188
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,637
After all those cigarettes,
she looked like an old Mike Tyson.

189
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,724
Ouch.

190
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,727
Oh, well, uh, what about that time,

191
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,687
what, about-- about three years ago,

192
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,982
you stopped speaking to me
over some funky bingo card.

193
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:06,527
It was not just a bingo card,
it was my bingo card,

194
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,821
-and you won ten big ones with it.
-[Maybelle gasps]

195
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,365
Whoa, whoa, nobody told me that.

196
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,620
Girl, you won $10,000
off Amelia's bingo card?

197
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,663
No, ten dollars.

198
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,417
Y'all stopped talking over ten dollars?

199
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,795
Of course not. That would be petty.
I stopped talking to her

200
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,340
'cause she wouldn't give me
the two dollars I paid for the card.

201
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,385
[all laugh]

202
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,262
Ahh! [laughs]

203
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,934
When you say it out loud,
it does seem kind of silly.

204
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,479
[whispers] Even if you whisper it,
it's still silly.

205
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,688
[all laugh]

206
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,440
You guys have got to do better.

207
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,942
Oh, yeah, you right.

208
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,401
Oh, you know what?

209
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,903
Hey, Amelia.

210
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,571
For the record, here.

211
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,074
Oh, no, I couldn't.

212
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,367
[laughs] Yeah, take it.

213
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,826
-No.
-Yes.

214
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,328
-No!
-Yes!

215
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,288
-No more--
-I'll take it.

216
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,667
I'm sick of being in the middle of you two
my whole life.

217
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,211
I'll tell you what, I want to be buried
way across the cemetery

218
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,963
so I can finally get some rest.

219
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:11,300
Fine, we'll put you with your ex-husbands.

220
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,468
[Dot laughs]

221
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,722
Ooh, well, now, should we put her
between Curly and Larry, or Larry and Moe?

222
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:17,932
[laughs]

223
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,351
That's just mean.

224
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,437
I prefer Curly and Moe.

225
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,814
[Dot laughs]

226
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,982

[laughs]

230
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,537
Mazzi really wants
that Meganoid-3000 robot,

231
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,497
but it's sold out everywhere.

232
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,832
[Moz sighs]

233
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,293
Oh! Relax, Cocoa.
Our little surprise is here.

234
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,711
This will totally convince him.

235
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,880
Yo! You guys order a Santa?

236
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:51,882
[clattering]

237
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,054
What is he waiting for?

238
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,390
I don't-- I-I don't know.

239
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,767
Uh, is-- is everything okay, Santa?

240
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,768
I'm stuck!

241
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,354
He's not Santa.

242
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,608
-See, I told you he wasn't real.
-You're a fraud!

243
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,035
[Shaka sighs] I'm really proud of us.

244
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,621
I know, right?
We slayed the roughing it game.

245
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,624
What's all this?

246
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:25,833
Our tent.

247
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,586
We roughed it out here last night,
just like you said.

248
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:29,587
[toaster dings]

249
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,133
Our waffles are ready.

250
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:39,889
You kids have clearly misunderstood
the spirit of this exercise.

251
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,892
Do you really think homeless people
have all these luxuries?

252
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,311
Well, you can't be sure that they don't.

253
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:47,772
Well, I can.

254
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:49,774
You can keep this tent,

255
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,525
but everything else
goes back in the house.

256
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,860
Wait, everything?

257
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,656
Everything, except you two.
You're gonna stay out here another night.

258
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,825
But it'll be really hard to stay out here
without all of our stuff.

259
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,160
Oh.

260
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,703
Now you're getting it.

261
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,125
Oh, oh, we need that.

262
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,252
You're homeless.

263

Get creative.

264
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,971

Oh, girl. We were more supreme
than the Supremes.

So, what happened?

-[Maybelle] Hmm.
-Yeah, Dot, tell her what happened.

278
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,717
We were invited to open
for Smokey Robinson.

We, as in a group.

280
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,137
Uh, go ahead.

281
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,934
Well, um, Amelia and Maybelle,
well, they... they were busy, so...

282
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,477
And I went at it alone.

283
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,312
And from that,
I was offered a solo contract.

284
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,189
I saw an opportunity and I took it.

285
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,233
You took it 'cause you're selfish.

286
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,486
Just because I looked out for myself,
it doesn't make me selfish.

287
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,405
That's kind of the definition.

288
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,492
Well, what was I supposed to do?

289
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,829
Amelia, she was pregnant,
she was on bed rest,

290
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,790
and Maybelle, well, she was already
on her second marriage.

291
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,083
I was not!

292
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,502
Oh, okay. Yes, I was.

293
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,755
Well, it's a shame,

294
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,215
but groups break up all of the time.

295
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,176
Exactly.

00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,804
Sure, feelings, they hurt at first...

297
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:48,184
but, um, it's been... 40 years.

298
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,143
Let it go.

299
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,479
We were not just a group.

300
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,105
We were sisters.

301
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:57,485
If anybody wanted to fight either one
of us, they had to fight all of us.

302
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,570
We didn't just have each other's backs,

303
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,530
we had each other's hearts.

You abandoned us!

that I would never forget it.

still felt this way. I really...

-It is not okay!

[rummaging sounds]

353
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,258
Is that a girl going through our trash?

354
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,603
Hi.

355
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,147
I'm sorry. Is this your turf?

356
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,483
Tonight it is.

357
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,069
Oh, n-no. You can-- you can keep those.

358
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,403
You sure?

359
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,656
This is at least three dollars
worth of bottles.

360
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,115
Yeah.

361
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,329
You two must be new to the streets.

362
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:56,914
How can you tell?

363
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,624
Because your head's not covered.

364
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,211
You lose most of your body heat
from your head.

365
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,922
So if you don't have a hat,
keep a blanket over it.

366
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,132
Give me a shoe.

367
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,390
This will keep your feet warm.

and that's my brother, Shaka.

Hi, I'm Crystal Cooper.

371
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,152
Are you all alone out here?
Where are your parents?

372
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,530
My mom and little sister
are at the shelter.

373
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,825
-Jade, let's go stay there.
-Oh, it's full now.

374
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,078
If you get in line really early,
you can sometimes score a bed.

375
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,748
Why don't they have room for everyone?

376
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,461
I guess there's just too many people
who need help.

377
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,631
Make sure you guys stick together.

378
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:51,510
You can wash up at the gas station
on King Boulevard.

379

They're pretty nice.

380
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,727
Christmas is the best time of the year
to go through people's trash.

381
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,603
People are always throwing out
their old stuff

382
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,188
to make room for their new stuff.

383
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,570
Look...

384
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,697
a perfectly good apple.

385
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,534
People are so wasteful.

386
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:17,953
Yeah.

387
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:19,913
They are.

Right.

394
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,218
Take these.

395
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,721
Oh, no, I-I can't. Then you'll be cold.

396
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,265
It's okay. I've got a spot inside tonight.

397
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,601
You need them more than me.

398

According to their website,
there are five Meganoid-3000s in there,

401
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,765
and one of them is going home with us.

Nope!

All right, here is the plan.

409
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,823
-This is the toy section.
-Okay.

410
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,450
When the doors open,
you run and block for me.

411
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,743
While you hold everyone off,

412
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,996
I'll grab a Meganoid-3000
and meet you at checkout.

413

-Merry Christmas.
-[laughs] Merry Christ... mas.

427
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,418
Do you still think about what could have
been if you ladies hadn't broken up?

428
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,170
Sometimes.

429
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,463
We could have been rich and famous.

430
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:34,882
Definitely.

431
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:38,594
But if you were rich and famous,
you wouldn't have this family.

432
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,097
I'd just replace them
with a bunch of housekeepers.

433

[laughs] Come on, M'Dear.

435
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,729
You couldn't have gone on tour,
you were pregnant with Moz,

436
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,648
and you probably wouldn't have had
Daniel and Grace.

437
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,775
Oh, you can't say that for sure.

[melody of "Deck the Halls" plays]

540
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:27,841
Okay.

541
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,134
Did you find her?

542
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,053
Her family can stay in my room,
it's snowing.

543
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,930
I called both homeless shelters.

544
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:37,100
No Crystal, no Coopers registered there
in the past month.

545
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,435
That's so weird.

546
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,770
I really wanted to help her
the way she helped us.

547
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,566
Well, until we find her, we'll just have
to find a way to pay it forward.

548
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,028
Grandpa, I've got a bunch of clothes
I want to donate.

549
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,571
And I've got lots of toys.

550
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,531
Amen.

551
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,658
Amen.

Mazzi's gonna be devastated

554
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,541
when he realizes he didn't get
that Meganoid-3000.

555
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,460
Yeah, you're right. You tell him.

556
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,213
We'll both break it to him.

557
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,130
All right.

558
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:10,675
[M'Dear sighs]

559
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,553
Who left all these lights on?

560
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,972
I was the last one out.
They were off when I closed the door.

561
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,849
Well, who built the fire then?

562
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,061
Well, we were all at church.
Did somebody break in?

563
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,897
Whoever it was ate all of our cookies.

564
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,484
Look! Look at all the toys!

565
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,860
The real Santa came!

566
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,529
I got it!

567
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:34,074
I got it! I got my Meganoid-3000!
I got it! Did you guys...

568
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,033
-No.
-No.

569
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,619
-Honestly, it wasn't us.
-Did you guys?

570
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,997
I don't even know what that thing is.

571
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,125
You guys were right.

572
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,585
Santa is real.

573
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,337
I hope he left me some batteries!

574
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,296
[sighs] Oh!

575
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:49,756
Aw.

576
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,801
Our little boy believes
in the magic of Christmas again.

577
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,177
So do I.

578
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:58,431
Now that, family,
is truly a Christmas miracle.
