Lizzie's present too,
but she's waiting.

13
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,184

It's hovering

18
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,599
Oh, my God.

19
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:10,135
Did you hear that?

20
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:13,505
<i>Beware
the curse of Lizzie Borden.</i>

21
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,258
<i>I first heard about
the curse of Lizzie Borden</i>

22
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:35,127
<i>in the winter of 2021.</i>

23
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:39,731
<i>Rumors that a dark force,
a demonic energy...</i>

24
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,201
Are you hearing that?

25
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,536
Something is knocking on
the underside of the table,

26
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:45,671
moving around us.

27
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:46,938
<i>Had been
following</i>

28
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,341
<i>the Borden family

29
00:01:49,408 --> 00:01:51,677
I think Lizzie's
present too, she's waiting.

30
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,212
She is, she's watching.

31
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:01,019
You okay Dave? Yeah, I don't
know what's going on there, buddy.

32
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,521
It's her, just relax.

33
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,490
Are you choosing Dave?

34
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,159
<i>I gathered
together a group of experts</i>

35
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:11,496
<i>to conduct one of the most
dangerous paranormal rituals,</i>

36
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,632
<i>a seance in the house.</i>

37
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,033
Just trust me, Dave, it's okay.

38
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,568
No, I don't want to let go.

39
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,104
<i>To get to the
bottom of the family curse.</i>

40
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:22,641
Trust me, Dave, okay?

41
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:26,645
Chris Fleming, a renowned
psychic medium, will lead the seance.

42
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,779
Take the pen.

43
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,581
<i>His job?</i>

44
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,850
<i>To keep us safe
from dark forces.</i>

45

<i>Luann Joly,

<i>who has investigated

00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:41,526
Who are you?

48
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:46,798
<i>And finally, Sam Baltrusis.</i>

49
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:49,467
<i>Sam is a direct
descendant of Lizzie,</i>

50
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,471
<i>who believes his family has
been cursed for generations.</i>

51
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:55,273
Okay, I don't have control of
my arm and I don't like this at all.

52
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,075
- I know that, Dave, trust me.
- You're okay.

53
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:19,331
Just pulled into the infamous
Lizzie Borden murder house.

54
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:27,506
<i>It's been almost a decade
since I was here,</i>

55
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:30,976
and it's the stuff
of nightmares.

56
00:03:31,043 --> 00:03:33,912
<i>Disembodied voices,
and cries in the night,</i>

57
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:36,982
<i>footsteps falling
throughout the entire house.</i>

58
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:39,585
<i>I mean, this house
is clearly haunted.</i>

59
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,322
<i>It's been investigated
hundreds of times, but...</i>

60
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:47,192
<i>this is the first time
that we're going to take on</i>

61
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,727
<i>the Lizzie Borden curse.</i>

62
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,532
<i>Could there be
a Borden family curse?</i>

63
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,900
<i>And was Lizzie a victim?</i>

64
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,271
<i>Did an evil entity
take possession of her body</i>

65
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:01,273
<i>and turn her into
a cold blooded killer?</i>

66
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,676
<i>Can the curse be broken?</i>

67
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,279
Hopefully we'll get those
answers during the next few days.

68
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:16,588
<i>It all began on the
morning of August 4th, 1892,</i>

69
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,392
<i>when Fall River
Massachusetts police</i>

70
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,362
<i>were called to investigate
a murder</i>

71
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,897
<i>at the home of
respected businessman,</i>

72
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:28,467
<i>Andrew Borden, Lizzie's father.</i>

73
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,451
<i>It was a gruesome scene.</i>

74
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:52,591
<i>Andrew's face had been
bludgeoned 11 times with a hatchet.</i>

75
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,728
<i>The corpse, still bleeding,</i>

76
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:00,332
<i>suggesting that he had been
murdered within the hour.</i>

77
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,736
<i>His nose had been completely
severed from his face.</i>

78
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,673
<i>His eyeball left
dangling on his cheekbone.</i>

79
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,443
<i>The bloody scene
continued upstairs,</i>

80
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:15,814
<i>where Andrew's wife,
Abby Borden,</i>

81
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:18,817
<i>stepmother to Lizzie
and Emma Borden,</i>

82
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,354
<i>was found lying face
down in a pool of blood,</i>

83
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:25,857
<i>her head smashed to pieces.</i>

84
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:30,729
<i>Of the two murders,
Abby's was far more gruesome,</i>

85
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:34,333
<i>with 18 savage hacks
delivered to her head.</i>

86
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:40,839
<i>Only Lizzie and the Bordens' maid
were home at the time of the attacks.</i>

87
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,008
<i>Lizzie's responses to police</i>

88
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:46,611
<i>were at times
strange and contradictory,</i>

89
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,948
<i>and she was immediately
considered the main suspect.</i>

90
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:55,019
You know, I didn't come
here to solve a crime.

91
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,155
I didn't come here
to put the thumbtack

92
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:01,259
in the final analysis
of the Lizzie Borden case.

93
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,561
<i>We came here to understand,</i>

94
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,297
<i>could there be a dark force
at work,</i>

95
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,367
<i>feeding off the tortured,
fractured souls</i>

96
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,268
that were left behind
by the Borden family?

97
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:13,571
Luann. Well, thanks
a lot for coming back.

98
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,974
- Shall we get started?
- Definitely.

99
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,242
Great, let me give you a hand.

100
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:20,512
<i>Luann Joly has had
some strange experiences</i>

101
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:21,847
<i>in the Borden house.</i>

102
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,715
<i>She's even
collected audio recordings</i>

103
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,885
<i>she believes are directly
from Lizzie herself.</i>

104
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,420
This is a...

105
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,456
I gotta tell ya, this is weird.

106
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,658
And I go into a lot
of haunted locations.

107
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,727
This place left
an indelible mark on me,

108
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,596
just walking back in,
already I get this

109
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:40,799
kind of apprehension feeling
in the middle of my chest.

110
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:43,535
Can't say it's fear, but it's
definitely uncomfortable.

111
00:06:43,602 --> 00:06:45,937
I mean, you've been
here three or four times.

112
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,540
What are you picking,
just walking back in again?

113
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:51,076
It's a very intimidating house.

114
00:06:51,143 --> 00:06:54,212
And every time I walk in here,

115
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:58,550
I feel it emotionally
and physically.

116
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:00,218
It's heavy.

117
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,888
<i>Could we already be feeling</i>

118
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:05,424
<i>the dark energy
from the family curse?</i>

119
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,026
<i>Before investigating the house,</i>

120
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,961
<i>let's go over
the murder suspects.</i>

121
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:17,803
<i>The Lizzie Borden trial
was the O.J. Simpson case of its day.</i>

122
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,106
<i>Everyone talked about this,</i>

123
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:25,177
<i>but in fact, Lizzie Borden was
eventually acquitted of these murders.</i>

124
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,814
<i>The petite, devout,
and devoted daughter,</i>

125
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,784
<i>could never have wielded
a heavy hatchet,</i>

126
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,119
<i>decimating half of Andrew's face</i>

127
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,989
<i>and pulverizing an equal
portion of Abby's skull.</i>

128
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,294
<i>Or could she?</i>

129
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:51,803
<i>This definitely
seems like it would be</i>

130
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,405
<i>a case of something
with passion,</i>

131
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:57,075
meaning this killer was
connected to the family somehow.

132
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:59,744
<i>And if not Lizzie, then who?</i>

133
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,483
<i>Lizzie's sister Emma
was out of town that day,</i>

134
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,819
<i>but Lizzie and Emma's uncle,
John Morse,</i>

135
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,421
<i>was visiting the family
and claimed he left</i>

136
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,057
<i>before the murders took place.</i>

137
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,826
<i>He was ruled out as a suspect</i>

138
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:18,230
<i>after he provided
an overly detailed alibi.</i>

139
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,966
<i>There were rumors
Morse dabbled in the occult,</i>

140
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:24,035
<i>and even allegations of
witchcraft in his lineage,</i>

141
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,971
<i>dating back to the late 1600s.</i>

142
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:30,041
<i>Could he be the origin
of the Borden family curse?</i>

143
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:35,580
<i>Did he conjure and bring a
dark force into the Borden home?</i>

144
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:39,718
<i>Or was he himself possessed
by demonic energies</i>

145
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,854
<i>that drove him to commit murder?</i>

146
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:45,457
<i>One thing's for sure,</i>

147
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:48,527
<i>John Morse was strong
enough to wield the weapon,</i>

148
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,529
<i>and he knew how to use it.</i>

149
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,063
<i>He was a butcher.</i>

150
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,866
And a butcher did
also carry something

151
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,369
very similar to an ax.

152
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,607
<i>Or was it someone else?</i>

153
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:06,611
Who are some of our
other eligible suspects?

154
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,047
<i>What do we know about
Bridget, the housekeeper?</i>

155
00:09:10,482 --> 00:09:12,617
<i>Bridget wasn't feeling
well that day</i>

156
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,287
<i>and ended up going
upstairs and laying down,</i>

157
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,155
<i>when the murders
actually happened.</i>

158
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:23,895
<i>Bridget was rumored
to be quite protective of Lizzie.</i>

159
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,165
<i>So was there an injustice
that she witnessed in that house</i>

160
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,401
<i>that sparked
this murderous rage?</i>

161
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,772
<i>She's present in the
house and didn't hear a thing?</i>

162
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,777
But we're looking at it again
from a logical perspective,

163
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,448
of here's a crime, here's a
perpetrator, here's how it's done.

164
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,117
We're not taking in,
or maybe most of the world

165
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:49,387
isn't taking in the possibility
of a paranormal effect.

166
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,526
<i>It's time to investigate
the presence of a dark force.</i>

167
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:58,463
<i>And I think we're gonna definitely
need some help from somebody else.</i>

168
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,532
I know the guy I might
have to call in for this,

169
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:02,934
somebody that is a little
bit more in tune to that side.

170
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,206
<i>Chris Fleming has been
a psychic medium for over 25 years.</i>

171
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,276
<i>If anyone can get
in touch and connect</i>

172
00:10:11,343 --> 00:10:14,379
<i>with the spirits or
demonic force in this house,</i>

173
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:17,582
<i>and get to the bottom of the
Lizzie Borden family curse,</i>

174
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:21,219
<i>I know Chris Fleming is the guy.</i>

175
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:24,022
We both had
traumatic experiences here.

176
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:27,225
Lizzie, of course, is the
main focus of this house,

177
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,694
but I don't know exactly
what we're dealing with,

178
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,763
and how much of it
is projected from her

179
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,565
- Mm-hmm.
- Or something projecting through her.

180
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,035
And that's why I thought
I could use your expertise.

181
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:41,473
You've had experiences with the
demonic and very malevolent ghosts.

182
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:43,775
Are you ready to do this again?

183
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:46,244
I've been wanting to come back
here for 10 years.

184
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:48,446
All right, well,
we got a big job ahead of us.

185
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,582
I say we investigate it,

186
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:52,817
and see if we can
break down some answers.

187
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,188
Luann Joly,
this is Chris Fleming.

188
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,791
- Hi, very nice to meet you.
- So nice to meet you.

189
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:03,394
Thank you. Dave told me a
little bit about your situation,

190
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,665
but I'm interested in hearing
what you've been going through.

191
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:12,003
I feel like Lizzie somehow
wants to communicate with me,

192
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,140
- Okay.
- But there are so many other spirits in the house,

193
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,141
that it can be
difficult for her,

194
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,544
and sometimes they're violent.

195
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:23,782
They are very verbal
in this house.

196
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,087
<i>Knowing that there may
be a powerful malevolent force here,</i>

197
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:32,624
<i>it's time to bring in
Sam Baltrusis.</i>

198
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:36,227
<i>He's the one person
who has a unique connection</i>

199
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,363
<i>to both the Borden murder house</i>

200
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,198
<i>and the dark energy it holds.</i>

201
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,434
Hey, guys.

202
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,212
- I've got a special guest who's gonna join us.
- How are you?

203
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,480
Sam, if you'd like
to have a seat.

204
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,972
Sam Baltrusis is a author.

205
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:49,908
He's written over
13 different books,

206
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:54,779
and he is actually related
to the Borden family.

207
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:58,516
<i>I've always been drawn
to the Lizzie Borden case,</i>

208
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:02,921
<i>but it wasn't until my mother did genealogical
research on her paternal family line,</i>

209
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,657
<i>that we discovered that I'm
twice related to the Bordens,</i>

210
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:10,595
<i>with connections going back to several
families from 17th century New England.</i>

211
00:12:10,662 --> 00:12:12,530
Now that I know that I'm
connected to the Borden family

212
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:15,800
and to a lot of crimes
that are horrific,

213
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:19,137
my mission in life is to
try to find some solution

214
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:21,740
to help these people heal
in the afterlife.

215
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,610
All right, so here's
the game plan for tonight.

216
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,279
Sam will be rejoining
us tomorrow for the seance,

217
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,348
but in the meantime,
Chris and Luann,

218
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,284
let's do a baseline sweep
of the house.

219
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,930
I'm gonna sit at base camp and
keep an eye on the entire investigation.

220
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:39,023
I'd really like you to go
along with Luann and observe.

221
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,358
Run your own recorder,

222
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,559
- Okay.
- And see if you're able to get any

223
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,561
corroborating
evidence with hers.

224
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,564
Luann, you do what you
do best, run your recorder.

225
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,033
See if Lizzie or any of the
other spirits of this house

226
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:50,835
are ready to come
out and talk tonight.

227
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,771
I'm gonna sit here
and observe from base camp,

228
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,306
but I want you
to both be careful.

229
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,509
You're both sensitive,
you're both open,

230
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:00,511
and it obviously can affect
you physically and mentally.

231
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,047
We'll gather what tools
you'd like to take up.

232
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,359
Let's see what
we can get tonight,

233
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,651
and what the spirits
have to share with us.

234
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:08,653
Be careful, let's go lights out.

235
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:12,056
<i>We have the entire house rigged.</i>

236
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,993
<i>We've got GoPros, we've
got night vision cameras.</i>

237
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,527
<i>We've got security cameras</i>

238
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,397
<i>covering just about
every inch of this house.</i>

239
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:21,966
<i>If something happens,
we're gonna catch it.</i>

240
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,406
All right, Dave,
see you in a bit.

241
00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:30,141
All right, be safe.

242
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,011
Luann,
I'm gonna follow behind you.

243
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,815
Okay. Good idea.

244
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,482
Luann, when
I was here 10 years ago,

245
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,418
I just want to tell
you this real quickly,

246
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:42,554
I was standing just
outside this hallway,

247
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,522
and I said,
"Did you do it, who did it?"

248
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,960
Holy.

249
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:51,028
Did you just hear that?

250
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,763
And I heard
what I believe sounds,

251
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,632
a woman saying,
"It wasn't me."

252
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,502
It was coming
from here in this area.

253
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,638
<i>Wow.</i>

254
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,509
<i>They're now entering
the Abby Borden murder room</i>

255
00:14:04,576 --> 00:14:08,246
<i>where Abby's body was found
bludgeoned next to the bed.</i>

256
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:09,781
<i>This area right here</i>

257
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,583
<i>is where you get
really disoriented,</i>

258
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,986
<i>and you get
that funhouse feeling.</i>

259
00:14:15,053 --> 00:14:18,322
You kind of don't feel
so good all of a sudden.

260
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:22,060
<i>Luann is clearly
affected by something in that room.</i>

261
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,728
<i>Let's try something, all right?</i>

262
00:14:23,795 --> 00:14:25,196
<i>I'm going to record,</i>

263
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,200
<i>Abby Borden,
are you here with us?</i>

264
00:14:30,602 --> 00:14:34,505
See how that just beeped
louder when I said something?

265
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:40,478
Chris is utilizing the Geiger
counter as a form of ITC,

266
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,813
trying to communicate
and have the spirits

267
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:47,418
influence the energy around
it, in different patterns.

268
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,487
Once for yes, twice for no,

269
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:52,023
asking questions
and holding up fingers

270
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,025
to see how many
beeps it will give.

271
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:57,495
<i>Abby, can
you beep four times in a row?</i>

272
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,842
It just hit four!

273
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:14,345
It just went beep, beep, beep,
beep in a sequence of four.

274
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,481
I have never seen that.

275
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:19,984
<i>I'll do a quick EVP here.</i>

276
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,620
Go ahead.

277
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,823
<i>Lizzie, do
you have anything to tell us?</i>

278
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,828
<i>Do you have anything to tell us?</i>

279
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:33,298
Ooh, listen to that.

280
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:34,732
There is something there.

281
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,368
<i>Do you have anything to tell us?</i>

282
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:40,571
I'm here.

283
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,706
She said, "I'm here?"

284
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:42,708
Yeah.

285
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:45,777
Dave, this is key.

286
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:49,046
Yeah, I could hear you from
down here. The EVP was really clear.

287
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,782
<i>- You heard it?
- Yes,</i>

288
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,050
<i>stick with it, keep going,</i>

289
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,828
<i>you've got something
intelligent responding. Get it.</i>

290
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,620
Okay, let's have
some more questions.

291
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,756
Let's go on to the other rooms.

292
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:04,529
Chris is getting
some unique... communication.

293
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,733
Appears to be intelligent
in the way

294
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,280
that it's trying
to make itself known.

295
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,938
Okay, now they're in
Lizzie Borden's bedroom.

296
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,041
Go ahead
and ask a question, Luann.

297
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,211
Lizzie, are you here with us?

298
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,287
Did you hear that?

299
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,958
Like from this wall, um...

300
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,961
But that was like direct voice
phenomenon, that wasn't EVP.

301
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,764
What's on the opposite side
of this room?

302
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,102
Um...

303
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:53,310
Okay, wait a minute,
this is the Borden, the, the...

304
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,446
- Andrew Borden's room though...
<i>- Right here, right?</i>

305
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,181
<i>Yes.</i>

306
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,584
I had an experience
here, but I want you

307
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:02,253
to tell me if you've had
any experiences over here.

308
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:03,654
Okay.

309
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,189
When I was here 11 years ago,

310
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,726
we came through here and
we smelled, like, rotting flesh.

311
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,595
Like, just, it was horrific.

312
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,930
It makes sense
when I was told later

313
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:15,133
<i>that one of the bodies
were laid down</i>

314
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,535
<i>on the dining room table
for a while,</i>

315
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:19,470
<i>so the whole house stunk.</i>

316
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,405
<i>So that would make
sense that this house</i>

317
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,840
<i>probably reeked
of rotting flesh.</i>

318
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:30,347
Uh, and I just saw,
it was almost like a child,

319
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,584
<i>a little girl that was standing right
here for a second and then vanished.</i>

320
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,653
Um, let me ask.

321
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,223
Was there a little girl
that was just standing here?

322
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:44,796
<i>I know I saw you.</i>

323
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,400
Speak to me please.

324
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,870
What is your name?

325
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,510
What... What I saw as...
I was talking to Luann,

326
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,580
saw something, corner
of my eyes and as I looked,

327
00:18:02,647 --> 00:18:04,515
it was about this tall,

328
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:07,251
but it was on this step
or the next step,

329
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,754
like a little girl standing
right here for a few seconds

330
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,824
<i>and then just vanished, gone.</i>

331
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:15,359
So obviously it was coming
into the room

332
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,828
or standing outside to watch
what we were doing.

333
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,350
It was curious
what we were discussing.

334
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,468
How many spirits
are in this house?

335
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,007
<i>How many
spirits are in this house?</i>

336
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,777
What the...

337
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,946
<i>Whoa, was that a growl?</i>

338
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,252
Wow.

339
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,627
<i>Wow, that
sounded like a demonic growl,</i>

340
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,096
<i>It's as if we angered something.</i>

341
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,264
<i>Let's keep going.</i>

342
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,033
We've got limited time
in that room,

343
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,169
and I would like you to try
to hit the upstairs room

344
00:18:58,236 --> 00:18:59,737
<i>at least for a few minutes.</i>

345
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,374
Now I've never been upstairs.

346
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:04,842
- You haven't?
- No.

347
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,249
- This room...
- I remember this room.

348
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,452
Seems to
have a lot of activity in it.

349
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:17,655
<i>They're now heading up to
the attic, to one of the maid's rooms,</i>

350
00:19:17,722 --> 00:19:20,391
<i>known to be
a paranormal hotspot.</i>

351
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,993
<i>Well...</i>

352
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,931
if you lay on the
bed, lay across it sideways,

353
00:19:26,998 --> 00:19:31,402
lay on the bed with your legs
hanging open, over the edge.

354
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:35,005
- Okay.
- And something will grab your legs,

355
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,808
or it will lift them up,
I've seen both.

356
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,743
So there was somebody
pulled underneath the bed?

357
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:40,811
Yes.

358
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:44,549
And it happens
when you're awake.

359
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,618
It happens in front
of witnesses.

360
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,620
Okay.

361
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,263
Who's the one that's
pulling on people's feet?

362
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:09,407
Whoa, I caught
something fly behind you.

363
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,612
Whoa, I caught something
fly behind you.

364
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,449
<i>Whoa, wait, what was that?</i>

365
00:20:19,317 --> 00:20:21,986
<i>Was that a spirit light?</i>

366
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:24,455
Yep, it was, like,
right where your hand is.

367
00:20:24,522 --> 00:20:26,090
Come touch my hand.

368
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,328
I'm gonna lean up.

369
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,435
I'm almost certain it was, like, a
white ball of energy or, like, an anomaly.

370
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,401
<i>I'm
almost certain it was like...</i>

371
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,804
Oh, camera's dead.

372
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,643
<i>Dave, my camera just went dead.</i>

373
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:51,348
That was a brand new
battery, brand new battery.

374
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,084
Why don't we wrap it up
for tonight?

375
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:55,152
We've got a lot to
go over and discuss.

376
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:58,789
And uh we'll meet down here
in the, uh, front room again.

377
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,225
Okay, be there in a second.

378
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,564
All right,
so why don't we break down.

379
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,501
We've had a long day,
but before we call it a night,

380
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:12,503
I'd like to try one more thing.

381
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,906
And that's to take the SLS
camera to the sitting room

382
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:17,842
where Andrew Borden
was murdered.

383
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:23,047
This is the area
here that Andrew Borden died.

384
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:25,916
<i>Chris is using a
specialized light sensor camera,</i>

385
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:29,053
<i>which will detect human forms.</i>

386
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:31,789
<i>And sometimes in these
haunted locations,</i>

387
00:21:31,856 --> 00:21:35,493
<i>it'll map out forms that we can't
even see with the naked eye.</i>

388
00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:39,530
<i>Oh! Something's
in the doorway, Dave.</i>

389
00:21:39,597 --> 00:21:40,731
What?

390
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,533
Oh, Now it's gone.
You just walked through it.

391
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,401
- Did it?
- Holy crap.

392
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,136
Something
just appeared in the doorway?

393
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,807
Yes, and it was small.
You walked through it.

394
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,009
- Were you videotaping?
- Yes.

395
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:54,211
<i>Something's in the doorway, Dave.</i>

396
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:57,615
<i>- What?
- You just walked through it.</i>

397
00:21:57,682 --> 00:22:00,885
Oh, jeez, something
just raced right across the room,

398
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:02,620
a black shadow.

399
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:04,288
While we're over by the stairs,

400
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,023
Dave, he says out to the spirit,

401
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:08,626
he says something like,
"Are you here?"

402
00:22:08,693 --> 00:22:10,127
Miss Borden, are you here?

403
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,298
What was that?

404
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,766
Did you just hear the banging?

405
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,768
Yeah, it was just like,
it would have been right here.

406
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,050
Could it have been the radiator?

407
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,940
That's like
two knocks, bang, bang.

408
00:22:23,007 --> 00:22:24,942
Right? Two means yes.
I know that.

409
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:27,478
That's what I use
for direct response method,

410
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,681
two for yes, one for no,
but it was metallic.

411
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,350
None of us have heard that sound

412
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:35,286
come from the radiator
since we've been here.

413
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:39,557
It's a possibility, but
I... I can't say for certain.

414
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,892
That was actually creepy.

415
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,427
All right,
let's call it a night.

416
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:45,229
We'll get up early,
review the evidence,

417
00:22:45,296 --> 00:22:48,432
and see what we were able
to uncover tonight.

418
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:50,968
So, Chris, Luann,
and I are spending

419
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,970
the remainder of the night here.

420
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:56,841
Would you be open to the idea of
spending one of the nights here with us?

421
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:59,910
Yeah. Oh, my God,
oh, I'd love to.

422
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:00,978
Okay.

423
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,050
It was definitely
an eventful night,

424
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,853
and I'm so happy
that Chris was able

425
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,988
to join Luann and I
for this investigation.

426
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,790
Something's going on here,

427
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:16,660
and this being my full night back
in the house to spend the night,

428
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:20,197
I'd be lying if I didn't say,
there was some apprehension,

429
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:24,068
but I'm excited to see
what happens.

430
00:23:24,135 --> 00:23:25,936
We'll check in again
with you tomorrow.

431
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:39,850
Chris is busy analyzing the
evidence from last night's investigation.

432
00:23:42,353 --> 00:23:44,488
So while he's doing that,
I'm gonna have Luann

433
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,023
take me around
the house to review

434
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:47,625
some of the EVPs
that they captured.

435
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:51,629
How was your night?

436
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,131
I couldn't sleep well.

437
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:05,375
Here is the spot where
Abigail Borden was murdered.

438
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,377
Yes.

439
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,712
<i>Even walking in here is...</i>

440
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,516
<i>hard.</i>

441
00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:17,054
<i>And you and Chris
captured more EVP in this room?</i>

442
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:18,389
- Yes.
- Okay.

443
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:21,058
A lot of EVP in this room.

444
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,527
<i>I'll do a quick EVP here.</i>

445
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,196
<i>Go ahead.</i>

446
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:28,032
<i>Lizzie, do
you have anything to tell us?</i>

447
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,670
Starting here, what did
you guys capture in this room?

448
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:43,213
I mean, that's really creepy.

449
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,681
You can hear that.

450
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,950
And it's like she's calling
out like she's crying.

451
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,018
"I'm a good daughter."

452
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:50,354
Yes.

453
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:54,758
<i>There were always rumors of unspeakable
conduct coming from the Borden home.</i>

454
00:24:56,761 --> 00:25:01,965
<i>Allegations that Lizzie's father,
Andrew Borden, may have abused her.</i>

455
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:07,438
<i>If true, did years of abuse finally
drive Lizzie to seek vengeance,</i>

456
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:11,241
<i>and could that blood lust have
spilled out on to her stepmother, Abby,</i>

457
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:14,244
<i>who really did nothing
to stop the abuse?</i>

458
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:17,047
<i>In reality, Abby was
Lizzie and Emma's stepmother,</i>

459
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:19,783
<i>whom Lizzie
referred to as Mrs. Borden,</i>

460
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,785
<i>when she was questioned by
the police.</i>

461
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:27,524
That particular EVP,
can reverse.

462
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,193
So wait a minute. You've
taken the audio and played it backwards?

463
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,595
Exactly.

464
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,664
What did you capture
or think you captured then?

465
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:34,998
Well, that's the thing,

466
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,335
it sounds pretty
much like the same voice,

467
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:40,470
like a woman in distress.

468
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,673
And it's clearer reversed.

469
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,951
If we're hearing Lizzie claiming

470
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:57,488
or proclaiming her innocence
in the first EVP,

471
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:58,989
we play it back.

472
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:00,991
"My daughter was raped."

473
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,563
- I mean, I hear it.
- I hear it dead on.

474
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,698
That's exactly what's playing
to us right now.

475
00:26:07,765 --> 00:26:10,968
<i>Abigail Borden
was not Lizzie's mom.</i>

476
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:13,637
<i>Abigail Borden
was her stepmother.</i>

477
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:14,604
<i>Exactly.</i>

478
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:15,639
<i>Her actual mother</i>

479
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:17,141
<i>died when Lizzie was very young.</i>

480
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,178
Could it be the spirit
of her biological mother,

481
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,848
trying to give us some
insight into what happened?

482
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:29,252
<i>Lizzy seems to be
verbalizing, vocalizing</i>

483
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,056
between the other side
and here, trying to fill us in,

484
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:35,592
trying to help us understand
what's taken place here.

485
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:40,998
Sometimes if you stand
right in this location right here,

486
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:46,537
they want to push you,
push you in that...

487
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:49,339
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

488
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:53,810
This area right here is where
you get really disoriented

489
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,879
and you get that
funhouse feeling.

490
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:58,849
Yeah, I kind of don't feel
so good all of a sudden.

491
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,285
Just now, you weren't just
re-enacting that for me.

492
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,421
- No, no.
- You feel like something's moving you.

493
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:07,558
Something is moving Luann,
pushing her,

494
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,227
shoving or creating
this disturbance

495
00:27:10,294 --> 00:27:12,763
so she can't feel equilibrium.

496
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,798
There is so much going on.

497
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:16,900
I don't even know where we begin

498
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,969
to start to discern
who's who, and what's what,

499
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:23,640
and we're still accepting the
fact that these are human spirits.

500
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:27,110
The other side is
wrought with confusion,

501
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:33,316
and dark entities like to take
on the presence of human forms.

502
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:36,787
And that's what leads to...
possession.

503
00:27:36,854 --> 00:27:40,123
That's what leads
to demonic infestation.

504
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,726
I don't know what we're
dealing with here specifically,

505
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,795
but I'm certainly gonna be
a lot more careful

506
00:27:44,862 --> 00:27:48,265
as we continue to move through this
investigation over the next couple of days.

507
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:51,335
So I have something really
scary that I want to play for you.

508
00:27:51,402 --> 00:27:58,042
And this, I think might be the
negative presence in the house.

509
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,892
Anvelo.
What is that, a name?

510
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:19,896
<i>Could this be the
demonic presence in the house?</i>

511
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:23,967
<i>The very thing causing the
plague on the Borden family.</i>

512
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:26,436
There is definitely some kind of

513
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:29,706
oppressive
presence in this house,

514
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,709
and it's starting to make me
very uncomfortable.

515
00:28:34,178 --> 00:28:38,315
And who is it or what is it, that's
really trying to come through?

516
00:28:38,382 --> 00:28:41,384
I have no idea where this is
going. Part of me is excited,

517
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,687
and part of me is
absolutely terrified.

518
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:47,524
Hey, guys,
Sam is back here with us,

519
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:50,661
and we've had some
weird experiences here.

520
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:53,864
Um, Chris, 10 years ago,
myself, 10 years ago,

521
00:28:53,931 --> 00:28:58,635
Ah, activity, sounds,
screams, voices, EVPs.

522
00:28:58,702 --> 00:29:02,072
And we're trying to piece
this together to understand

523
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,874
what's going on in this area

524
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:07,544
that it is so active
with the supernatural.

525
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:11,482
And why is it affecting
the Borden family so deeply?

526
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:16,419
Is there any truth to this Borden
family curse in your opinion?

527
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,422
Well, if you look at
our backstory,

528
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,758
it's definitely a lot of blood,

529
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,129
and a lot of murders that
happened through our history.

530
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:30,901
<i>Now there is one murder that was
sensational, that happened in 1832,</i>

531
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:33,504
<i>and it involves one
of my distant cousins.</i>

532
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:36,573
<i>Her name is Sarah Maria Cornell.</i>

533
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:39,176
<i>According to Sam,
a Methodist minister,</i>

534
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:42,245
<i>Reverend Ephram Avery
was strongly suspected</i>

535
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:45,649
<i>of both the rape
and murder of Sarah Cornell,</i>

536
00:29:45,716 --> 00:29:49,853
<i>and was rumored to be the
father of her unborn child.</i>

537
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:53,423
<i>She was found hanging from
a stag pole at a nearby farm.</i>

538
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,794
<i>Bruises were later discovered
around her abdomen,</i>

539
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,732
<i>suggesting an abortion
may have been attempted.</i>

540
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:05,001
<i>Sarah's murder was considered
the crime of the century</i>

541
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:08,271
<i>until the Borden murders came
about some 60 years later.</i>

542
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:09,873
He was actually
tried and acquitted,

543
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:11,675
very much like
Lizzie Borden was acquitted

544
00:30:11,677 --> 00:30:13,744
for the murders
of the Borden family.

545
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:17,881
<i>Could this be evidence of
a demonic force in the Borden family?</i>

546
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:20,818
The devil?
Like, that's terrifying to me.

547
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:22,753
All right, Sam.
Now going back to Lizzie,

548
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:28,225
do you believe that Lizzie
Borden wielded the hatchet or ax,

549
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:33,630
or that something else was using
her as a vessel for that murder?

550
00:30:33,632 --> 00:30:36,633
<i>I absolutely think there
was something more sinister at play.</i>

551
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:40,036
<i>She may have had sort
of a dissociative episode</i>

552
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:43,173
<i>where she basically was not
in her body when it happened.</i>

553
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,042
I do think she did do it.

554
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:48,679
<i>However, I don't think that
she was in control of her body.</i>

555
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:52,916
<i>I do think that Lizzie
is definitely predisposed</i>

556
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:55,919
<i>to being taken over
by a dark entity.</i>

557
00:30:59,056 --> 00:31:02,392
She does not take ownership
for the murders.

558
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,362
I don't think she will ever
take ownership for the murders.

559
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:14,471
If she was possessed
and killed her father,

560
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:17,674
she didn't kill her
father, the devil did.

561
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:20,810
<i>Do I think
she committed the murders?</i>

562
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:24,815
<i>I do physically,
but something else did it.</i>

563
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:34,157
<i>No one would have accused
this small-framed woman,</i>

564
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,794
<i>who was 32 years old, of killing
her father and her stepmother.</i>

565
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:43,767
<i>That was the perfect person to
take over, and the entity knew that.</i>

566
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:46,770
Now let's discuss Lizzie

567
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:49,973
and her sister Emma's uncle,
John Morse.

568
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:55,045
<i>If there is something
to the rumors</i>

569
00:31:55,112 --> 00:31:57,247
<i>that Morse dabbled in
the occult,</i>

570
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,449
<i>what if Lizzie
practiced with him</i>

571
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:01,852
<i>and something
took her over then?</i>

572
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,853
And it would explain
too that during possession,

573
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:08,191
how people get much more
strength, they're empowered.

574
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:12,229
<i>And that would explain some of
the violent brutality that took place.</i>

575
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:15,265
What other strange ties
to deaths

576
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,534
and murder and mayhem
do you have?

577
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:19,670
There was Eliza.

578
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,341
Eliza Darlene, she was a Borden.

579
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:26,053
She actually married
into the Borden family,

580
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:30,146
<i>was not blood related to Lizzie
Borden, but her husband was.</i>

581
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,348
Where'd Eliza live?

582
00:32:31,415 --> 00:32:32,716
Right next door.

583
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:43,560
<i>One fateful day she
actually took her two children,</i>

584
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:45,295
<i>threw them down a well.</i>

585
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,791
<i>Well, then the question
we need to ask,</i>

586
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:18,962
<i>is was Eliza possessed by a
demonic force when she did it?</i>

587
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:31,074
<i>And then she took a
straight razor and cut her neck.</i>

588
00:33:37,748 --> 00:33:39,388
<i>And Dave, I'm telling you,
I'm channeling.</i>

589
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,084
<i>I'm, like, picking
up something right now,</i>

590
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:44,688
and I'm not really sure who
it is, and maybe it's Eliza.

591
00:33:44,755 --> 00:33:47,757
This seat is like the worst seat
for me to do this, guys. I'm sorry.

592
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,092
Do you need to stand up?

593
00:33:49,094 --> 00:33:50,827
I just don't, yeah, no,

594
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:52,562
this is like a really
bad seat for me.

595
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,141
You've got a clairvoyant
sitting in the spot

596
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,542
<i>where Andrew Borden
is brutally murdered.</i>

597
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:56,966
I can understand that.

598
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,902
It's like, I'm a clairvoyant,
I'm a psychometrist,

599
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:01,772
so I pick up on the energy. So I'm
definitely feeling energy right now.

600
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,974
- Let me grab my recorder.
- Okay.

601
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:07,241
While you're talking, even if she's not
fully channeling, if we can get anything.

602
00:34:08,245 --> 00:34:09,646
No, don't apologize, man.

603
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:11,181
No, no, no,
no, this is what we do.

604
00:34:11,248 --> 00:34:14,117
We're beginning session
number one in the front parlor

605
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:16,453
at the site
of Andrew Borden's murder.

606
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,989
Sam Baltrusis, you're feeling
something come through you.

607
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,391
What are you feeling, Sam?

608
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:29,265
<i>I'm seeing a woman, and she's got
beautiful hair. She's brushing her hair.</i>

609
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,935
She loves her children, she
loves her children so much.

610
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,105
<i>Eliza, is this you?</i>

611
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:38,942
<i>What do you want us to know?</i>

612
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:40,477
What can we do to help you?

613
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,680
Help my children.

614
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:46,116
<i>Are your children with
you on the other side, Eliza?</i>

615
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:48,351
They're here.

616
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:51,888
And, Eliza, what can we do
to help your children?

617
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,523
What would you like from us?

618
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,828
Keep them away from them.

619
00:35:00,831 --> 00:35:03,366
Keep them away from him.

620
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,501
From who, Eliza?

621
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:14,811
<i>Are there other energies here</i>

622
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,481
<i>that are tormenting
your children, Eliza?</i>

623
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:19,215
Yes, yes.

624
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:22,085
<i>Yes? Are they
tormenting you as well?</i>

625
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:25,222
Yes, yes, they
won't let me come here.

626
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,024
Are you in danger by
coming here to talk to us about this?

627
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:32,362
<i>Yes, yes, they
will kill my children, kill my children.</i>

628
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,232
But who are they?

629
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,300
<i>Is she referring
to the dark forces</i>

630
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,402
<i>that could be behind
the family curse?</i>

631
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:44,040
<i>Did a dark force
make her kill her children?</i>

632
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:51,247
<i>And worse, does it continue
to haunt Eliza and her children</i>

633
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,716
<i>even in the afterlife?</i>

634
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,386
Chris Fleming
took me aside afterwards

635
00:35:56,453 --> 00:35:58,988
and said, Sam Baltrusis,
he's the real deal.

636
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,457
Things I was picking up on,

637
00:36:00,524 --> 00:36:02,926
he would immediately start
to address and talk about,

638
00:36:02,993 --> 00:36:05,261
I know he knew
what was going on here.

639
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:07,397
These spirits are
communicating through him,

640
00:36:07,464 --> 00:36:08,932
the Borden bloodline.

641
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:10,867
They went to Sam Baltrusis.

642
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:12,135
Wow.

643
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:18,875
Now, do you feel residual
energy of Eliza with you?

644
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,745
<i>It was definitely
about her children.</i>

645
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:26,950
And I definitely felt her pain
and she's, she's desperate.

646
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:28,818
<i>It's like you go
into another world.</i>

647
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,255
<i>You can actually see it through
her eyes, while you're in that state.</i>

648
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,959
<i>So the idea
that she killed her children,</i>

649
00:36:36,026 --> 00:36:38,494
<i>it's not on her conscience?</i>

650
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:41,431
<i>Maybe she really is desperate
to help those children.</i>

651
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,900
<i>She's desperate to help them
because she believes</i>

652
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:48,238
<i>the dark entity from the curse
is tormenting her and them,</i>

653
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,306
<i>even in the afterlife.</i>

654
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:54,043
When you were saying
that they don't protect the children,

655
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,311
that there's something else,

656
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,881
what was it that
she was afraid of?

657
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,150
<i>It was a monster.</i>

658
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:02,519
<i>That's the only way
she could describe it.</i>

659
00:37:02,586 --> 00:37:07,323
I think that, that people misconstrue
that entity as Andrew Borden,

660
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:08,658
and I don't think
it's Andrew Borden.

661
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,792
No, it's not.

662
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:10,914
I think it's something else.

663
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:22,138
<i>Anvelo has been this
name that keeps coming up,</i>

664
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,841
something very dark
and demonic in nature.

665
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,143
But it's hiding.

666
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:30,880
Is it hiding because
we're here looking for it?

667
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:34,884
Because it knows we're gonna
challenge its authority in this house?

668
00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:36,686
And after what happened
to Sam Baltrusis,

669
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:39,089
channeling, something
coming through him,

670
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:42,959
claiming to be Eliza,
talking about her two children

671
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:47,297
being bullied or oppressed
by something dark,

672
00:37:47,364 --> 00:37:48,365
was that Anvelo?

673
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:55,372
Guys I gotta walk out, I'm having
a hard time breathing. I gotta, I can't.

674
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:00,010
I gotta get some air.

675
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:04,748
Yeah, this
is getting really intense.

676
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:15,458
Oh, my God, I can't
breathe. I have a hard time breathing.

677
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,726
It's like, I'm being choked.

678
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:18,528
Like oxygen's coming out of me.

679
00:38:18,595 --> 00:38:20,707
It was like the whole bunch
of people are on top of you.

680
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:22,532
If you've ever had that happen,

681
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:24,667
like you play games when you were
kids and everybody's on top of you,

682
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:27,070
you can't breathe, can't
breathe, that type of thing.

683
00:38:27,137 --> 00:38:28,805
There was a restriction
of airflow.

684
00:38:28,872 --> 00:38:30,940
I had to walk out.
I couldn't take it anymore.

685
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:32,462
I was fighting it
while I was in there.

686
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,814
<i>Okay, we're, we're
obviously seeing evidence</i>

687
00:38:37,881 --> 00:38:40,417
that there is some
sort of malevolent presence

688
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,285
here at the Borden house.

689
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:43,927
But you know
who we haven't heard from yet

690
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:48,024
is one of the main suspects
in these murders, John Morse.

691
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,098
<i>Now John Morse
was Lizzie's uncle.</i>

692
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,904
<i>He had visited Andrew Borden
the day of the murders.</i>

693
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:05,809
<i>And when it comes to motive,
the guy had plenty.</i>

694
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:10,780
<i>He and Mister Borden
were reportedly overheard</i>

695
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:15,085
<i>having a heated argument over
money right before the murders.</i>

696
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:20,590
<i>Plus, there's the matter
of what he did for a living.</i>

697
00:39:20,657 --> 00:39:22,058
<i>He was a butcher,</i>

698
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,928
<i>and a butcher did
also carry something</i>

699
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:28,264
very similar to an ax.

700
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:31,534
<i>Well, let's not forget the
rumors that he dabbled in the occult.</i>

701
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:35,271
<i>What if he unknowingly brought
something into the Borden home?</i>

702
00:39:36,206 --> 00:39:38,274
Sam, is there another place
we can go

703
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:41,744
to try to actually
connect with John Morse?

704
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:45,014
Well, you know, there's a place
in the Freetown State Forest,

705
00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:48,284
actually where John Morse lived.

706
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:50,220
<i>The house is no longer there,</i>

707
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,822
<i>but that would be
the place to go.</i>

708
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,557
Now that we've all
had a moment to breathe

709
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,159
and think about the dark force,

710
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:58,762
we need to figure
out where it came from.

711
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:07,570
<i>The idea of
a curse on this family</i>

712
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,842
<i>does it exist as though
somebody specifically cursed</i>

713
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:16,245
the bloodline of the Bordens?

714
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,515
<i>Do you believe that it's a
genetic passed down curse?</i>

715
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:22,919
If you look at John Morse's
backstory,

716
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:26,656
the way he was acting was
very odd the night of the murder.

717
00:40:26,723 --> 00:40:29,125
<i>He normally actually
sleeps on the third floor,</i>

718
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:30,793
<i>the night before
he actually stayed</i>

719
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:33,596
<i>in the John Morse room
on the second floor,</i>

720
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,732
<i>where Abby was murdered.</i>

721
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:38,935
<i>Almost like he was taken
over by something as well.</i>

722
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:42,472
<i>And there are allegations of
witchcraft in his and Lizzie's bloodline.</i>

723
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:46,075
<i>I wouldn't be surprised
if whatever he attracted</i>

724
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:49,479
<i>where he lived somehow it
followed him to the Borden house.</i>

725
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:52,916
Let's see if we can get some
answers tonight at the forest.

726
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,024
So we're all sure about this?

727
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:02,602
- Yeah, I want to do this.
- Let's do it.

728
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,093
Stay together, guys.

729
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:15,371
<i>This is the exact spot
where John Morse lived.</i>

730
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:21,377
<i>If he's guilty of these murders
or if he's eternally cursed,</i>

731
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:25,648
<i>it's quite possible his spirit
is still here today.</i>

732
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,351
<i>We are not alone.</i>

733
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:36,959
All right,
now everybody stay alert.

734
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:40,163
<i>If John Morse was
cursed by the Borden family demon,</i>

735
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:43,833
<i>he might be the actual killer
of Andrew and Abby Borden,</i>

736
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,235
<i>pinning it all on Lizzie.</i>

737
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:47,971
Who knows what
we're gonna find out here?

738
00:41:48,972 --> 00:41:50,507
We are not alone.

739
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:56,646
I'm hearing like whispering,
it sounds like little children,

740
00:41:56,713 --> 00:41:58,581
but it's static sounding.

741
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:00,116
There's definitely
whispering going on.

742
00:42:00,183 --> 00:42:01,918
I'm getting
chanting of some sorts.

743
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,853
You're picking
up on chanting out here?

744
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,522
Yeah. We're not alone.

745
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:10,393
This is where Lizzie's
uncle's house once stood.

746
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,261
And if the rumors
are true, guys,

747
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:15,532
this is where he would have
engaged in these occult practices.

748
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,534
I'm getting stuff flying
around real quickly, around us.

749
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,971
I got a little disoriented from
the change in the field over here.

750
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,240
You ask a question.

751
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:28,211
John Morse,
are you here with us?

752
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,685
Did you kill Andrew
and Abby Borden?

753
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:41,991
Let me play this back.

754
00:42:45,295 --> 00:42:46,329
Something, here, listen.

755
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:50,533
"Satan loves you?"

756
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:53,570
It says,
"Satan loves you."

757
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:03,179
Why, why would
it say that though?

758
00:43:03,246 --> 00:43:05,781
If you're already
picking up on the same

759
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:08,718
environmental field that
we have at the Borden house,

760
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,622
is it following us, or are
we just out in its nature?

761
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:16,392
Obviously something out here is
trying to get into our heads early.

762
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:20,964
It's protecting its property.
We've come into their area.

763
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:25,201
Or there was a lot of ritual
that happened out here.

764
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,580
And that's what
I'm picking up on.

765
00:43:27,604 --> 00:43:28,964
I'm picking on
some sort of ritual,

766
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:30,886
Maybe there's something
that has been opened up.

767
00:43:33,144 --> 00:43:34,477
Did you hear that?

768
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:42,218
Sounds like something

769
00:43:42,285 --> 00:43:43,463
just walking
around our perimeter.

770
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,420
Do you keep hearing that?

771
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:45,622
We're being circled,

772
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:47,249
there's something
is circling around us.

773
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:52,094
All right, let me I'll
film with SLS. See if we get it.

774
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:55,732
Now, Chris is again
utilizing a tool called the SLS camera.

775
00:43:55,766 --> 00:44:00,903
It's seeking human form, and what
we find in some haunted locations,

776
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:06,242
when someone is not visibly
there, it will map in a figure,

777
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:07,977
and not just an outline
of the figure,

778
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:11,614
but sometimes it will move and
correspond to what we're asking.

779
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:14,584
And when it
says "Anomaly detected",

780
00:44:14,651 --> 00:44:17,386
it's picking up on
some sort of human form.

781
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:21,257
I hate to say it, but I'm
picking up stuff that may be dark,

782
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:22,892
something was conjured here.

783
00:44:24,796 --> 00:44:27,196
Did you hear
something just whisper right here?

784
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:28,998
Yeah.
I've been getting voices.

785
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:31,801
I keep hearing like whispers.

786
00:44:31,803 --> 00:44:34,470
There's definitely
something out here with us.

787
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:37,407
I'm not sure if it's something
related to John Morse,

788
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:40,676
or the dark energy conjured
from the family curse.

789
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,546
Whatever it is,
it wants us to break apart

790
00:44:43,548 --> 00:44:45,548
and to follow whatever it is
in the woods.

791
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:48,751
And it's kind of using,
you know,

792
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:50,486
I didn't feel
uncomfortable at first

793
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:52,488
when I first walked here,
but now I do.

794
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:55,692
Something is very dark and
menacing, lurking in the woods.

795
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,028
So I have my dousing rod.

796
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:02,231
I'm actually,
my hand is going numb.

797
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:05,835
Something's very, very,
very, very powerful here,

798
00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:09,172
and it's holding my hand.
Can you show me where you are?

799
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:12,241
Right over here.

800
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:15,021
And that's where I was
seeing something walking

801
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,913
and kind of like
circling us over here.

802
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:19,849
Sam,
why don't you go over there?

803
00:45:19,916 --> 00:45:21,250
Okay.

804
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:24,720
Now Sam's picked up
on his dowsing rods

805
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,557
that the energy is drawing
him in that direction.

806
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,728
So, Dave, it just said, "Here,"

807
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:36,999
and it came from above me,
and it sounded very wicked.

808
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,068
It sounded like, "Here".

809
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:42,739
Uh, so it was very gravelly
and kind of scary.

810
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:45,541
I feel like I'm being
used as human bait right now,

811
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:47,743
but I, but I think this is
important to communicate

812
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,512
with whatever's
lurking in the woods.

813
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:52,815
Oh, my God.

814
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:59,388
It grabbed my arm, while I was
pushing out, It grabbed my arm.

815
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:02,125
Oh, my God.

816
00:46:03,693 --> 00:46:06,796
All right stop, everybody just
stop for a second. Hold on.

817
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:11,701
Direct ahead of you, right
directly in front of you, Chris,

818
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:13,503
I see two glowing eyes.

819
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:15,438
Oh, my God.

820
00:46:15,505 --> 00:46:17,239
I've got them
on the camera right now.

821
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:19,721
I mean, they're there, there's
something there between you two.

822
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:23,179
That's too far
for this SLS to map.

823
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:26,449
It looks like it's
maybe 10 to 20 yards tops.

824
00:46:28,718 --> 00:46:29,919
Now they're gone.

825
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:39,929
Okay, we're gonna try
something here.

826
00:46:39,931 --> 00:46:41,774
Hey, you guys come around,
let's let's make a triangle.

827
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:43,599
All right, guys,
what we're going to do here

828
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:47,336
for a couple of minutes,
is DRVP.

829
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:48,804
I'm gonna use the spirit box.

830
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,406
I got a little bit
of an amplifier here

831
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:52,741
going into an orbit
speaker, all right?

832
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:57,914
What I want to do is have some direct
voice phenomenon using the radio.

833
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,321
Spirits, I know you can hear us.

834
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,424
Are you mad that we're here?

835
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:13,896
Leave.

836
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:17,633
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry?

837
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,368
Yeah. I'm sorry.

838
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:23,906
John Morse,
is our family cursed?

839
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:28,678
What's hovering
above me right now?

840
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:33,382
Satan?

841
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:41,057
All right, let's do
an EVP session right here.

842
00:47:42,592 --> 00:47:44,727
We can hear you
moving around us.

843
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:49,866
We come in respect, we're
simply seeking answers and truth.

844
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:55,972
John Morse, are you the
one that's circling us right now?

845
00:47:57,407 --> 00:48:00,309
Is it true that you dabbled
in occult practices?

846
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:04,380
Are you angry that
we're in your territory?

847
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:11,954
- Holy crap!
- Was that like a drum sound? Yeah.

848
00:48:11,956 --> 00:48:13,889
What the hell was that?

849
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,959
Something just went
running right by my feet.

850
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:18,628
And then I heard the drum sound.

851
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:20,429
It went in there,

852
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:23,032
like through the trees
right across the ground.

853
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:25,968
All right, play it back.

854
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,440
Get out, listen to this,
get out, listen.

855
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:39,892
- Right there, "Get out."
- "Get out".

856
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,756
It was an evil voice.
Let me play this for you.

857
00:48:51,127 --> 00:48:52,628
"Get out", right there.

858
00:48:55,131 --> 00:48:56,799
Well, we definitely made contact

859
00:48:56,866 --> 00:48:59,201
with an evil energy
out here tonight,

860
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:02,939
but was it that same demonic
force that Sam believes

861
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:06,608
has plagued the Borden family
for centuries?

862
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:10,012
Whatever it was, it had a
message for us loud and clear.

863
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:12,481
Get out.

864
00:49:13,683 --> 00:49:16,152
And it makes our next
step in this investigation

865
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:17,987
even that much more treacherous.

866
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:21,524
It's time we sit down
for the seance.

867
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:34,770
I wanted to talk about
a couple of things

868
00:49:34,772 --> 00:49:36,706
before we even consider
doing the seance,

869
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:39,642
because we all know
how dangerous this can be.

870
00:49:39,709 --> 00:49:43,779
Our mission has to be to find
evidence of the Borden family curse

871
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:46,849
to hopefully detect
this presence of dark energy

872
00:49:46,851 --> 00:49:48,851
that's followed
the family ever since.

873
00:49:48,853 --> 00:49:52,855
In the woods, we encountered
a presence calling itself Satan.

874
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:59,662
Here in the house, we
encountered the demonic presence.

875
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:03,999
What the...

876
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,068
Something reaches out
from underneath the bed?

877
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:07,336
Yes.

878
00:50:07,403 --> 00:50:10,172
Including
the demon attached to Eliza.

879
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:12,574
Keep them away from them.

880
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:14,810
From who, Eliza?

881
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:19,648
One of the most concerning
pieces of evidence to me

882
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:22,851
is one of the EVPs
that Chris and Luann captured

883
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,254
in her first
overnight investigation.

884
00:50:25,321 --> 00:50:27,656
She plays one for me that

885
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:31,060
really kind of seems very
weird and mysterious, right?

886
00:50:31,127 --> 00:50:35,330
She plays this, and I believe the
question you asked was "who's here?"

887
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:37,133
And she gets a response.

888
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:45,541
<i>So this word has been
kind of a puzzle for us.</i>

889
00:50:45,608 --> 00:50:48,343
<i>We can't find any translation
that seems to make sense.</i>

890
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:51,146
<i>It's not a name that's
associated with this home.</i>

891
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:52,681
And immediately
what comes to mind

892
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:54,216
when you hear a name like that?

893
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:56,819
I automatically thought
demon when I first heard that,

894
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,621
or something that was not human.

895
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:02,224
But we know demons
don't give up their names,

896
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:04,727
because when they do,
they can be extracted.

897
00:51:05,428 --> 00:51:06,896
So it's something...

898
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:09,432
you mentioned that you
wondered if it was an anagram,

899
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:11,233
or if it was a game
that this thing was playing,

900
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:13,969
that there was
multiple meanings.

901
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:17,106
<i>So today I started to try
to break down this concept,</i>

902
00:51:17,173 --> 00:51:18,340
<i>and where are we?</i>

903
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:21,376
<i>Who walked this land?</i>

904
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:23,378
<i>And could this
be the dark energy</i>

905
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,582
that's plagued Lizzie's
family for generations?

906
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:29,184
I did a little bit
more digging and research.

907
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:31,720
<i>I contacted some
locals in the area.</i>

908
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:35,057
We know that the Wampanoag indigenous
people were settled in this area.

909
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:36,592
I wanted to see
if there was somebody

910
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:38,727
that could explain
the word to me.

911
00:51:38,729 --> 00:51:40,169
And I reached out
to a friend of mine

912
00:51:40,196 --> 00:51:42,198
from the Native American
community.

913
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,799
She was a little stumped,

914
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:47,470
but she dug through
and found an Algonquin word.

915
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:49,872
And there's a loose
derivation of this word,

916
00:51:49,939 --> 00:51:53,342
which means, "he died,"<i> ankelo.</i>

917
00:51:53,344 --> 00:51:54,676
<i>- You're kidding.
- So,</i>

918
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:56,478
<i>there's one version
which makes sense.</i>

919
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,948
<i>In this home that we're in, where
a man was brutally murdered,</i>

920
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:01,417
<i>a woman brutally murdered,
we get, he died.</i>

921
00:52:01,484 --> 00:52:03,285
<i>Then the bombshell hits.</i>

922
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:05,554
Another friend of mine
comes to me and says,

923
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,289
this is Italian.

924
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:10,092
And what it's telling you
is, "The veil."

925
00:52:10,094 --> 00:52:12,961
So it's giving answers
in multiple tongues,

926
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:16,365
which again
seems demonic in nature.

927
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:19,702
And without explaining
to him what I was asking for,

928
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:23,405
he goes on to describe, as
in a wolf in sheep's clothes.

929
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:29,712
I was upstairs and the thing
was coming through,

930
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:31,246
and I was connecting with it,

931
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:33,849
and I felt the anger and
then it called me something.

932
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:36,552
So this thing is
taking the face of many names.

933
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:40,556
- Oh, it's pissed now.
- It's pissed.

934
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:45,060
It just called me a bastard.

935
00:52:45,062 --> 00:52:47,262
And I told the producer,
I said write this down.

936
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:48,730
I want that piece of paper

937
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:50,732
in the middle of
the table on the seance.

938
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:52,601
This thing has many faces.

939
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,971
And that's how it stays
hidden, is it tricks people.

940
00:52:57,807 --> 00:53:00,876
<i>So, could Anvelo
be the dark energy</i>

941
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:03,478
<i>conjured by the Borden
family curse?</i>

942
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,616
Maybe it's all derivations
of the exact same thing.

943
00:53:07,618 --> 00:53:10,085
That's what this word
seems to be,

944
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:13,555
<i>something that can plug in
and fit perfectly like a game</i>

945
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:15,291
<i>this thing is playing with us.</i>

946
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,795
<i>I don't question
that there aren't fragments...</i>

947
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:23,165
of each one of the people

948
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:25,634
<i>that have passed
through this house</i>

949
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:29,371
<i>in the final moments of their
life in panic and in shock,</i>

950
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:31,173
<i>as they're being
brutally murdered.</i>

951
00:53:33,509 --> 00:53:37,046
<i>That had to fracture, that
had to leave a psychic scar.</i>

952
00:53:39,315 --> 00:53:42,918
<i>Lizzie's name has
been evoked so many times.</i>

953
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:47,656
<i>How could a fragment of who
she is not be a part of this house?</i>

954
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:50,793
<i>This is a feeding ground
for dark energy,</i>

955
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,861
<i>because everybody comes here</i>

956
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:55,197
<i>anticipating the allure
of being in a house</i>

957
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:56,999
<i>where brutal murders took place.</i>

958
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:58,467
<i>Some revel in it.</i>

959
00:53:58,534 --> 00:54:00,269
<i>Some worship it.</i>

960
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:06,342
And it's created a cathedral
of chaos in one place.

961
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,944
So as we decide, if we even want
to move forward with the seance,

962
00:54:08,946 --> 00:54:13,015
we all have to consider the very
real possibility that this dark force,

963
00:54:13,082 --> 00:54:14,483
it may come through,

964
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:16,551
that the demon
from the Borden curse

965
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:18,954
may come after each
one of us, personally.

966
00:54:18,956 --> 00:54:21,890
I want to bring something
up with Chris's permission.

967
00:54:21,892 --> 00:54:22,892
Mm-hmm.

968
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:26,628
When you came to
visit with us yesterday, Sam.

969
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:27,696
Yeah?

970
00:54:27,698 --> 00:54:29,498
You were sitting on the couch,

971
00:54:29,565 --> 00:54:32,901
we were talking, Chris started to
become very physically agitated,

972
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:34,436
<i>and in pain.</i>

973
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:37,439
<i>He had to leave the house
to collect himself.</i>

974
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:40,776
<i>And you told us,
there's someone here.</i>

975
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:43,312
<i>I feel it's like a father
force, a father figure,</i>

976
00:54:43,379 --> 00:54:45,381
<i>his dad, Reggie,</i>

977
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:48,450
and then you paused and you
said, "And there's somebody else".

978
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:52,054
"There's a health issue
involved, and that's why he's here".

979
00:54:52,121 --> 00:54:53,322
Yeah.

980
00:54:53,389 --> 00:54:56,058
And Chris received
a message today.

981
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:58,260
Would you share with
the team what's going on?

982
00:54:58,262 --> 00:55:00,262
Yeah.

983
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,597
I just got a call
that my mom collapsed,

984
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,734
and she was unconscious,

985
00:55:05,736 --> 00:55:09,104
and I'm waiting to hear back,
what's the condition.

986
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,807
Then it hits me, going, "My God,

987
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:13,675
since I've been in this house,
I've had nothing but headaches

988
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:15,143
because it
doesn't want me here."

989
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,412
So what they will do
is if they can't get at you,

990
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:20,649
they will go at people
that are close to you.

991
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:27,623
This is a point
where I think each one of us

992
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:29,825
need to kind of
sit back and reflect

993
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:33,362
on how much further
we want to push.

994
00:55:33,364 --> 00:55:36,432
I don't know if we're
getting deeper in danger

995
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:39,635
for any one of these team
members or somebody we love,

996
00:55:39,702 --> 00:55:42,838
by what we're doing,
in trying to reveal the truth.

997
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,108
That side doesn't want
to be uncovered.

998
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:49,611
To tell the truth and help
Eliza and her children.

999
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:01,056
To help the memory
of the Bordens?

1000
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:02,058
Yeah.

1001
00:56:04,193 --> 00:56:05,728
Is it worth the cost
to one of us?

1002
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,062
Yeah.

1003
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:20,542
All right, we've all had a
little chance to take a breather.

1004
00:56:21,844 --> 00:56:23,779
Moving forward.

1005
00:56:23,846 --> 00:56:26,915
The concept and idea was
facing this head-on tonight,

1006
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:29,518
and having a seance.

1007
00:56:29,585 --> 00:56:32,654
Our hope is to make contact
with the dark energy

1008
00:56:32,656 --> 00:56:35,524
and to possibly break
the Borden family curse,

1009
00:56:35,526 --> 00:56:38,861
<i>bringing peace to Lizzie
and the other spirits.</i>

1010
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:41,130
<i>Her great aunt Eliza
and her children,</i>

1011
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:44,800
<i>who are trapped or perhaps
being tormented in the afterlife.</i>

1012
00:56:44,867 --> 00:56:48,203
We know the dangers,
we know the possibilities,

1013
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:51,407
but we also know why we're here.

1014
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:53,475
This is what we do,

1015
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:55,010
but I want this to be something

1016
00:56:55,012 --> 00:56:57,092
that everybody's comfortable
with, and if you're not,

1017
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,748
no harm, no foul.

1018
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:02,217
There's absolutely
no love lost between us

1019
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:04,953
if you decide to step away
from this, this evening.

1020
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:08,023
It's time we sift through
the lies.

1021
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:11,427
It's time we sift
through all of the legend

1022
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:13,228
and get to the heart
of this story.

1023
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:16,498
We may have a fight
on our hands.

1024
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:20,769
There is something here that
doesn't want to be interfered with.

1025
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:23,038
Are you okay doing
this tonight, are you in?

1026
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:26,508
I'm in, yeah, I'm in.

1027
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:28,109
- Chris?
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

1028
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,711
- Luann?
- Yes.

1029
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:31,613
Let's do it.

1030
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:38,854
<i>We've chosen
to perform the seance</i>

1031
00:57:38,856 --> 00:57:41,390
<i>in the actual bedroom
where Lizzie Borden</i>

1032
00:57:41,457 --> 00:57:44,059
<i>spent most of her time
in this house.</i>

1033
00:57:44,126 --> 00:57:47,529
<i>And if the dark entity
attached itself to Lizzie,</i>

1034
00:57:47,531 --> 00:57:49,398
<i>this is where we're most
likely gonna find it.</i>

1035
00:57:49,465 --> 00:57:52,267
It's go time,
we are set up for the seance.

1036
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:54,670
I've got the entire
table rigged with GoPros

1037
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:58,006
that will catch action
from every angle.

1038
00:57:58,008 --> 00:57:59,675
If the spirit manifests itself,

1039
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:01,777
we are gonna
capture something tonight.

1040
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:07,816
<i>We're about to open
a portal here,</i>

1041
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:10,752
<i>a potential doorway to evil.</i>

1042
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:15,690
<i>This is the most dangerous
paranormal contact for anyone to attempt.</i>

1043
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:17,493
<i>There've been very few seances</i>

1044
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,840
<i>actually conducted in this house</i>

1045
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:20,963
<i>because of
those dangers involved.</i>

1046
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:26,902
<i>We're trying to discover
and contact the source of this curse.</i>

1047
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:31,106
Well, we've all
agreed to come here

1048
00:58:31,108 --> 00:58:33,575
to try to help the spirits

1049
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:35,577
that are part of
the Borden household,

1050
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:37,446
the spirits that have
reached out for help,

1051
00:58:37,513 --> 00:58:39,982
from Eliza and her two children

1052
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:43,452
<i>to Elizabeth
and the Bordens directly,</i>

1053
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:45,921
to see if we can lift
this curse,

1054
00:58:45,988 --> 00:58:48,390
lift this burden that's
been put on their shoulders.

1055
00:58:48,457 --> 00:58:50,259
We might as well begin.

1056
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:54,663
<i>Each person has an
important role to play during the seance.</i>

1057
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:57,132
<i>Luann has a strong
connection to this house,</i>

1058
00:58:57,934 --> 00:58:59,735
<i>In capturing the Anvelo EVP.</i>

1059
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:05,040
<i>Will the demon come out tonight?</i>

1060
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:09,845
<i>Sam is related to Lizzie Borden,</i>

1061
00:59:09,912 --> 00:59:13,315
<i>and has channeled the spirit
of Lizzie's great Aunt Eliza.</i>

1062
00:59:13,382 --> 00:59:17,119
<i>She drowned her children in
the house directly next door,</i>

1063
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:20,656
<i>44 years before
the Borden murders.</i>

1064
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,791
<i>Will she make contact again,</i>

1065
00:59:22,858 --> 00:59:25,193
<i>and bring them peace
in the afterlife?</i>

1066
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:27,996
<i>Me, I'm gonna open myself
and my body</i>

1067
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:30,666
<i>to whatever spirits need
to help them.</i>

1068
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:34,002
<i>And finally, there's Chris,
the leader of the seance.</i>

1069
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:37,139
<i>He understands the dangers
better than any of us.</i>

1070
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:40,008
<i>A seance opens a door
to the other side,</i>

1071
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:44,145
<i>inviting in good
and sometimes bad spirits.</i>

1072
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:46,815
<i>They can take over
your body and attach to you,</i>

1073
00:59:46,817 --> 00:59:48,150
<i>or in the best case scenario</i>

1074
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:51,620
<i>you'll find out who
or what you're dealing with,</i>

1075
00:59:51,687 --> 00:59:53,555
<i>and then close that door.</i>

1076
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:56,891
<i>But we all have to be aware
of the worst case scenario.</i>

1077
00:59:56,893 --> 00:59:58,827
<i>When you give
that kind of permission,</i>

1078
00:59:58,894 --> 01:00:02,831
<i>anything can
walk through, anything.</i>

1079
01:00:02,898 --> 01:00:05,500
<i>Chris's number one job
is to keep us safe.</i>

1080
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:11,707
First thing we do is to
relax the body and the mind,

1081
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,442
to loosen the consciousness,

1082
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:16,711
but not loosen the soul
where it leaves the body.

1083
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:19,081
Each one of our souls
needs to stay within the body.

1084
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:21,683
Breathe in,

1085
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:25,520
breathe out.

1086
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:29,324
Breathe in,

1087
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:33,528
breathe out.

1088
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:35,707
People say, "Hey, are you gonna be
able to communicate with this spirit?

1089
01:00:35,731 --> 01:00:37,532
Are you gonna be successful
in getting rid of this?"

1090
01:00:37,534 --> 01:00:38,934
I don't know till I'm there.

1091
01:00:39,001 --> 01:00:40,669
I don't know till
I am facing this thing

1092
01:00:40,736 --> 01:00:42,471
<i>and confronting this,
what can be done.</i>

1093
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:47,643
Gonna ask the spirits
that reside in this house,

1094
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:50,812
can already feel
some of your presence,

1095
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:55,150
to not be afraid,
but to come forward,

1096
01:00:55,217 --> 01:00:58,887
to speak to us,
we have some questions,

1097
01:00:58,954 --> 01:01:02,290
but we also have a purpose.

1098
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:04,459
And I believe
you know that purpose.

1099
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,732
Feel free to speak to us.

1100
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,847
- Are you hearing that?
- Yeah.

1101
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:28,917
Something is knocking on the
underside of the table, moving around us.

1102
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:33,221
And moving around the room.

1103
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:36,124
It's multiple.

1104
01:01:38,994 --> 01:01:41,262
I think Lizzie's present too,
but she's waiting.

1105
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:42,497
She is, she's watching.

1106
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:44,900
Call Elizabeth.

1107
01:01:47,269 --> 01:01:48,603
Elizabeth, is that you with us?

1108
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,605
Can you knock the table
if that's you?

1109
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:56,678
Elizabeth, I promised you
that I would not call you here.

1110
01:01:56,746 --> 01:01:59,081
This is special,
this is for the children.

1111
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:02,784
This is your chance
to redeem yourself.

1112
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:05,954
You are a good person,
I know you.

1113
01:02:06,021 --> 01:02:07,489
I know you, you're a good girl.

1114
01:02:07,556 --> 01:02:08,556
You're a good daughter.

1115
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:16,031
It said,
"Back off a second."

1116
01:02:16,098 --> 01:02:17,432
Allow it to come through.

1117
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,040
You okay, Dave?

1118
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:27,686
Yeah, I don't know
what's going on there, buddy.

1119
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:29,611
It's Elizabeth. It's her.

1120
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,180
Are you choosing Dave?

1121
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,250
Okay.

1122
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:37,212
Just trust me,
Dave, allow it to come through.

1123
01:02:37,586 --> 01:02:38,586
All right?

1124
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:41,857
Just trust me, Dave, it's okay.

1125
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,125
No, I don't want to let go.

1126
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:44,192
Trust me.

1127
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:46,695
Trust me, Dave, okay?

1128
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:49,397
Take the pen.

1129
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:54,503
Back off.

1130
01:02:57,541 --> 01:02:59,874
No, I don't like this, Chris.
I don't like this.

1131
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:01,209
I don't have control of my arm.

1132
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:02,677
- I don't like this at all.
- I know that.

1133
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:04,439
- I know that, Dave, trust me.
- You're okay.

1134
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:10,585
It's just a form
of communication.

1135
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:13,388
I'm holding on.

1136
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:17,525
I know, but it's not used to it.

1137
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:19,327
Slow down, relax.

1138
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:21,530
I can't let go,
I'm not fighting it.

1139
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:22,864
Okay, just let it go.

1140
01:03:22,866 --> 01:03:24,533
It's only gonna use
the arm, trust me.

1141
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,902
It only has permission
at this moment to use the arm.

1142
01:03:28,003 --> 01:03:29,871
This is a form
of automatic writing.

1143
01:03:29,873 --> 01:03:31,273
It's very weird.

1144
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:32,340
Allow it.

1145
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,144
Calm down, spirit, calm down.

1146
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:39,214
No more.

1147
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:42,651
Okay, what do
you mean by no more?

1148
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:47,856
Yes. No more, okay, I know.

1149
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:51,493
Just relax, Dave.

1150
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:53,695
What do you mean "no more"?

1151
01:03:53,697 --> 01:03:54,830
Is this Lizzie?

1152
01:03:57,366 --> 01:03:58,366
<i>Is this Lizzie?</i>

1153
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:02,871
I believe that's yes, okay.

1154
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:08,577
Lizzie, I'm here
to help you, okay?

1155
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:10,045
All of us are.

1156
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:12,948
You must tell the truth,

1157
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,951
and I know you're tired
of hearing it.

1158
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,254
<i>Did you physically do it?</i>

1159
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:23,658
Why does that
feel like it's lifting me?

1160
01:04:25,794 --> 01:04:27,929
Just relax, Dave, it's okay.

1161
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:31,366
I know it's scary,
just trust me.

1162
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,112
Something's trying
to pull you away, Lizzie.

1163
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:35,670
Something's trying to pull you out.

1164
01:04:35,738 --> 01:04:36,978
Come back, you have permission.

1165
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:41,910
Lizzie, did you physically
do it?

1166
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:44,012
<i>Yes or no?</i>

1167
01:04:48,083 --> 01:04:49,284
"No," okay.

1168
01:04:49,351 --> 01:04:51,052
Was it a demon, Lizzie?

1169
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:54,456
Do you know who did it?

1170
01:04:56,759 --> 01:04:57,759
No?

1171
01:04:59,628 --> 01:05:01,763
But you're in spirit now,
so you can see,

1172
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:03,965
you can have access
to who did it.

1173
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:07,969
Was it a male that
did it, a male, a man?

1174
01:05:07,971 --> 01:05:09,037
Yes or no?

1175
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:11,773
No.

1176
01:05:11,775 --> 01:05:13,842
Lizzie, why are
you pointing to me?

1177
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:14,910
No more.

1178
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:15,977
No more.

1179
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:19,848
Okay you're tired of
hearing about it.

1180
01:05:19,915 --> 01:05:22,450
<i>I don't know what
this is, Chris. I don't feel it.</i>

1181
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:24,019
Don't worry, okay?

1182
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:26,554
It's only gonna be temporary.

1183
01:05:27,856 --> 01:05:29,791
Lizzie, what do
you want to tell us?

1184
01:05:29,858 --> 01:05:32,127
Do you want us to stop
bringing up the past?

1185
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:33,528
Is that what you're saying?

1186
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,400
<i>I don't know
what the hell that is.</i>

1187
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:39,634
<i>- Lie.
- Lie?</i>

1188
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:42,470
L-I-E.

1189
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:44,672
Yes.

1190
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:47,275
Oh, so the past is a lie,
you did not do it.

1191
01:05:49,878 --> 01:05:50,812
Yes.

1192
01:05:50,814 --> 01:05:51,813
It's okay.

1193
01:05:51,815 --> 01:05:53,614
Okay, okay it's okay.

1194
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:55,050
You told me you didn't do it.

1195
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:56,885
I believe you.

1196
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,522
Lizzie, stop
for a second, relax.

1197
01:06:01,423 --> 01:06:02,890
Okay?

1198
01:06:02,892 --> 01:06:04,559
If you don't respect this body,

1199
01:06:04,626 --> 01:06:06,427
I have to remove you from it.

1200
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:07,429
Come on.

1201
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:09,697
Speak to us.

1202
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:11,633
I'm trying to,
I just don't like this, man.

1203
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,034
It doesn't feel right.

1204
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:16,171
I don't think this is a woman.
I don't think this is a woman.

1205
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,507
I don't like it, Chris.

1206
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:20,909
All right, enough.

1207
01:06:22,711 --> 01:06:23,711
Enough.

1208
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:26,982
It's all right, brother.

1209
01:06:28,384 --> 01:06:31,186
Okay, relax.

1210
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:34,188
Listen, I want you to listen.

1211
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:36,858
This is gonna just linger
for a little bit, okay?

1212
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,193
Trust me, give me your hand now.

1213
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,794
- Sure.
- All right.

1214
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:44,132
<i>That's the first time that Dave</i>

1215
01:06:44,199 --> 01:06:45,733
<i>has experienced
something like that.</i>

1216
01:06:45,735 --> 01:06:47,335
<i>And I've known him for 17 years,</i>

1217
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,137
and I believe
one of the reasons is,

1218
01:06:49,204 --> 01:06:51,739
<i>Dave is a little
skeptical of mediumship,</i>

1219
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:54,275
<i>channeling, automatic writing.</i>

1220
01:06:54,277 --> 01:06:57,211
<i>So Lizzie decided
I'm gonna go through him,</i>

1221
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:58,546
teach him something.

1222
01:06:59,748 --> 01:07:01,616
Dave, how are you feeling?
Better?

1223
01:07:01,683 --> 01:07:03,618
Just worn out,
and in a lot of pain.

1224
01:07:03,685 --> 01:07:05,787
Okay.
I think she's gone.

1225
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:08,156
Let's keep going.

1226
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:20,101
Something's moving around
under the table with us.

1227
01:07:20,103 --> 01:07:22,804
Can you feel it? I mean, it's
bumping and moving around us.

1228
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:27,642
It's just to scare you,
it's swarming.

1229
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:30,011
I think it's the dark energy.

1230
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:32,447
It's...

1231
01:07:32,514 --> 01:07:33,715
They feed off of fears.

1232
01:07:33,782 --> 01:07:35,050
Not nice.

1233
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:36,117
Don't worry.

1234
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:45,193
It's really pissed off.

1235
01:07:45,195 --> 01:07:46,995
I know, I know.

1236
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:56,538
Write a word for me. What are
you trying to say? Write a word.

1237
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,239
All right.

1238
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:01,175
Relax, Luann.

1239
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:03,111
It's only temporary.

1240
01:08:03,178 --> 01:08:04,212
Are you Lizzie?

1241
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:05,847
Yes or no?

1242
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:10,985
It's saying backwards, "Yes."

1243
01:08:10,987 --> 01:08:12,520
I don't really like this.

1244
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:14,522
Okay this is,
this is not Lizzie.

1245
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,391
Okay, I'm gonna ask you to...

1246
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:20,228
I'm gonna tell you to leave now.

1247
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:22,663
You must leave now.

1248
01:08:26,468 --> 01:08:27,468
Listen to me.

1249
01:08:28,503 --> 01:08:29,504
Who are you?

1250
01:08:32,142 --> 01:08:33,708
You're not human,
you're drawing.

1251
01:08:35,077 --> 01:08:36,878
6-6-6. Okay.

1252
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,414
She just drew 666 in reverse.

1253
01:08:39,481 --> 01:08:42,683
<i>Something started
affecting Luann more negatively.</i>

1254
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:46,020
<i>I believe she was making
contact with that dark energy,</i>

1255
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:49,357
<i>possibly the same from
the Borden family curse.</i>

1256
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:53,828
I think it's Anvelo or
something that infests that home

1257
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:55,463
and takes many guises.

1258
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:57,932
It doesn't scare me.

1259
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:03,538
There is no fear.

1260
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:10,111
I don't know what it needs,

1261
01:09:10,113 --> 01:09:12,580
- but it needs something and it's not good.
- I understand.

1262
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:13,915
I understand that.

1263
01:09:13,982 --> 01:09:15,617
I think it wants us to die.

1264
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,053
Are you one of the fallen?

1265
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:20,855
It doesn't want to talk.

1266
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:21,923
I know you don't.

1267
01:09:21,925 --> 01:09:23,124
It doesn't want to talk.

1268
01:09:23,126 --> 01:09:24,392
Of course it doesn't,

1269
01:09:24,394 --> 01:09:26,060
it doesn't want the truth,
that's why.

1270
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:30,131
It's time for you to go home.

1271
01:09:30,133 --> 01:09:34,268
You've been feeding off of
the regret and fear of others.

1272
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:37,071
You've been
feeding off of the pain of others,

1273
01:09:37,139 --> 01:09:40,742
because of the pain that you
have from thousands of years ago.

1274
01:09:42,277 --> 01:09:44,212
I'm gonna face this dark energy.

1275
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:45,380
Look at me.

1276
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:48,449
Look at me.

1277
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:54,088
There is no violence
or hate or anger behind me.

1278
01:10:01,496 --> 01:10:03,965
All right, this
is what we're gonna do now.

1279
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:05,833
I'm gonna use this spirit box.

1280
01:10:05,835 --> 01:10:09,437
I am doing this so
that we can listen in

1281
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:11,372
on the invisible spectrum,

1282
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,840
to hear some of the spirits

1283
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:15,910
that are starting
to surround us.

1284
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:21,416
We're gonna do
this together, Sam.

1285
01:10:22,585 --> 01:10:23,885
You guys give me your hands.

1286
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:38,032
Now, I asked the Bordens,
their spirits to come forward.

1287
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:40,935
Lizzie, can you hear me?

1288
01:10:44,473 --> 01:10:45,540
<i>I feel your presence.</i>

1289
01:10:48,610 --> 01:10:49,811
Can you speak to us?

1290
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:52,213
You have permission.

1291
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:59,220
Did you hear that?

1292
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:01,089
Yeah.

1293
01:11:01,156 --> 01:11:03,958
I heard there
is a demon in this house.

1294
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,893
Whoa, that's confirmation.

1295
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:07,829
The demon is here with us.

1296
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:13,234
Why was this told to me,
the faces of many names,

1297
01:11:13,236 --> 01:11:14,236
who is that?

1298
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:17,572
Did it say, "pure evil"?

1299
01:11:17,639 --> 01:11:18,773
That just say "pure evil"?

1300
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:19,775
Yeah, pure evil.

1301
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:22,777
<i>There is something out there</i>

1302
01:11:22,844 --> 01:11:27,448
<i>that has a shape or a form,
that may change over time.</i>

1303
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:30,585
<i>And that has many faces,
and many names.</i>

1304
01:11:30,652 --> 01:11:33,254
<i>And when we say, well,
it's the devil or it's Satan,</i>

1305
01:11:33,256 --> 01:11:35,690
or it's this evil person,
how could somebody do that?

1306
01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:37,792
<i>Well what is it all?</i>

1307
01:11:37,859 --> 01:11:39,294
<i>It's all just evil.</i>

1308
01:11:40,395 --> 01:11:43,664
It is now time to confront
this dark energy

1309
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:46,267
<i>and break the family curse.</i>

1310
01:11:46,269 --> 01:11:49,337
No other entities are allowed
to enter into this domain.

1311
01:11:50,606 --> 01:11:51,806
It's being shut down.

1312
01:11:53,675 --> 01:11:56,077
I ask the holy angels
to come forward

1313
01:11:57,212 --> 01:12:00,014
and to assist in removing
this infestation,

1314
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:04,885
to wipe clean the past
of the tragedy and the pain.

1315
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:08,356
We're here to call out
to the souls and spirits

1316
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:12,026
<i>that have been
wanting to cross over,</i>

1317
01:12:12,028 --> 01:12:13,604
<i>and been wanting
to go home and find peace.</i>

1318
01:12:13,628 --> 01:12:16,998
Allow them to come home, to
be welcome with the creator,

1319
01:12:18,433 --> 01:12:21,969
to return to peace,

1320
01:12:21,971 --> 01:12:24,171
to remove the emotions
and the shame.

1321
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:29,043
Are you okay, Dave?

1322
01:12:29,045 --> 01:12:32,080
We just ask that you find
the entity known as Anvelo,

1323
01:12:33,382 --> 01:12:37,385
and any other dark manifestations
that may be in this home.

1324
01:12:37,387 --> 01:12:41,655
We rebuke them and heal
the psychic scars of the dead.

1325
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:45,159
We ask that the lies stop
and that the truths prevail.

1326
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:49,197
We ask the Borden family
to come forward

1327
01:12:50,465 --> 01:12:52,400
and join us in this plea.

1328
01:12:53,602 --> 01:12:56,737
<i>We ask that you give
the grace of forgiveness</i>

1329
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:59,374
<i>to Lizzie Borden and her family.</i>

1330
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:05,046
<i>We ask that you
raise the veil of hatred,</i>

1331
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:10,050
<i>anger, suspicion,
jealousy, and rage</i>

1332
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:11,519
<i>that has been put on this house</i>

1333
01:13:11,586 --> 01:13:14,889
<i>and break the curse
of the Borden family.</i>

1334
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:21,162
It's Eliza. Eliza.

1335
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:27,468
We invite you into our circle,
Eliza, along with the children.

1336
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:31,639
I hear her saying, "I'm
sorry for bringing you here".

1337
01:13:33,608 --> 01:13:35,810
- It's okay.
- Don't be sorry.

1338
01:13:35,812 --> 01:13:37,144
We're here now together.

1339
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:38,579
So much pain.

1340
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:41,816
<i>So much pain.</i>

1341
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:45,920
Did something
influence you, Eliza?

1342
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:50,057
Do you remember that day?

1343
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:56,764
<i>The monster.</i>

1344
01:13:58,033 --> 01:13:59,700
Something affected you?

1345
01:13:59,702 --> 01:14:01,669
The monster.

1346
01:14:03,371 --> 01:14:05,840
Please. Please.

1347
01:14:05,842 --> 01:14:08,176
Eliza, are you here
with the children now?

1348
01:14:08,243 --> 01:14:09,710
Yes.

1349
01:14:09,712 --> 01:14:12,046
Good, see, this is good,
you're together.

1350
01:14:12,048 --> 01:14:13,448
There's forgiveness.

1351
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:15,716
Do you see your children
surrounding you, Eliza?

1352
01:14:15,718 --> 01:14:16,651
Oh, my beautiful babies.

1353
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:18,118
<i>Right.</i>

1354
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,387
<i>- The babies.
- Yes.</i>

1355
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:22,190
<i>You don't need to feel pain now.</i>

1356
01:14:22,257 --> 01:14:25,793
You're forgiven, your
children forgive you, look.

1357
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:28,529
<i>Look at them,
they surround you in love.</i>

1358
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:30,698
We invite you
into the circle of love.

1359
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:35,670
You have to try
to help a soul be put to rest.

1360
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:39,206
<i>Means to remove
anything keeping them here,</i>

1361
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:41,809
<i>giving them that freedom,
breaking that shackle.</i>

1362
01:14:41,877 --> 01:14:44,479
Then the angels are there
to help them cross over.

1363
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:47,481
Eliza, there's a man
with golden hair

1364
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,484
<i>that is descending
down into the light.</i>

1365
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:53,154
<i>He's offering his hand to you.</i>

1366
01:14:53,221 --> 01:14:55,089
<i>She's letting go of me.</i>

1367
01:14:55,156 --> 01:14:57,058
<i>Do not be afraid and go to him.</i>

1368
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,628
He will protect
you from the darkness.

1369
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:03,898
He is here for you now.

1370
01:15:03,965 --> 01:15:06,234
She's got her arms open wide.

1371
01:15:06,301 --> 01:15:07,735
<i>I'm feeling a cold breeze.</i>

1372
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:10,304
These children are so special.

1373
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:15,215
There are more that
are coming out of the light

1374
01:15:15,243 --> 01:15:20,114
<i>that are to create a safe
passage for them with you,</i>

1375
01:15:20,116 --> 01:15:22,216
<i>to break the bond
from the darkness.</i>

1376
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:24,919
We ask now that
you clear our mind,

1377
01:15:24,986 --> 01:15:28,589
our soul and our bodies of any
energies that are not our own,

1378
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:33,261
<i>to cast away anything
that means us harm,</i>

1379
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:36,063
<i>as we end the circle
in light and love,</i>

1380
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:38,666
<i>brothership, friendship.</i>

1381
01:15:38,733 --> 01:15:41,903
<i>We thank you for your time, for
the spirits that have come forward.</i>

1382
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:45,940
<i>We beg mercy for those
that are still lost.</i>

1383
01:15:45,942 --> 01:15:49,176
And we thank God above for
all that He's brought to us today.

1384
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:51,712
- Amen.
- Amen.

1385
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:05,893
<i>Today was a great day.</i>

1386
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:08,255
<i>There's a multitude of different
things that happened today.</i>

1387
01:16:08,296 --> 01:16:10,230
Each one of us was
obviously brought together

1388
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:13,768
for a specific
reason, for ourself.

1389
01:16:13,835 --> 01:16:15,703
<i>Dave had his experience.</i>

1390
01:16:15,705 --> 01:16:18,238
<i>Sam had his experience,
Luann had hers.</i>

1391
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,508
I had mine, and together,

1392
01:16:20,575 --> 01:16:23,911
we had experiences with
a multitude of various souls

1393
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:25,112
that came through,

1394
01:16:25,114 --> 01:16:27,248
<i>that in some way
or some shape or form</i>

1395
01:16:27,315 --> 01:16:28,950
<i>are connected to this place.</i>

1396
01:16:30,318 --> 01:16:34,121
And together we all
collectively experienced it.

1397
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:38,459
<i>Today, we did
what we set out to do.</i>

1398
01:16:38,461 --> 01:16:41,128
<i>We made contact
with the dark energy,</i>

1399
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:44,865
<i>hopefully breaking
the Borden family curse.</i>

1400
01:16:44,867 --> 01:16:46,934
<i>We made contact
with who we believe</i>

1401
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:50,071
<i>were Lizzie and Eliza
and her children,</i>

1402
01:16:50,138 --> 01:16:52,473
<i>and we sent them
all into the light,</i>

1403
01:16:52,475 --> 01:16:54,475
<i>where they can finally be
at peace.</i>

1404
01:16:57,145 --> 01:16:58,746
<i>There are no coincidences.</i>

1405
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:03,818
<i>Luann, she got this information,</i>

1406
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:05,620
<i>which connected to me,</i>

1407
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:08,356
<i>which connected to Chris,
which brought in Sam,</i>

1408
01:17:08,423 --> 01:17:12,026
<i>and we became a unit
that could come together,</i>

1409
01:17:12,093 --> 01:17:14,895
with the same ideals,
the same intention

1410
01:17:14,897 --> 01:17:17,431
and the same hopes to help.

1411
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:21,902
<i>We followed the breadcrumbs,
the trail of information,</i>

1412
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:24,438
as confusing as it was at times,

1413
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:29,176
to the conclusion
that there is a haunting.

1414
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:31,779
There is a curse.

1415
01:17:31,846 --> 01:17:34,448
<i>The curse comes in many layers.</i>

1416
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:37,985
<i>The house where two
horrific murders took place.</i>

1417
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:42,189
<i>The psychic scars left behind
from the murder victims</i>

1418
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:43,958
<i>and the family survivors.</i>

1419
01:17:45,593 --> 01:17:48,195
<i>I feel like the work
that we did this week,</i>

1420
01:17:48,197 --> 01:17:50,664
<i>definitely took off a layer,</i>

1421
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:53,467
<i>a very dangerous layer
on the Borden family curse.</i>

1422
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:57,705
<i>I knew that I was able to communicate
with spirit and be a clairvoyant.</i>

1423
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:02,409
It went really dark,
really fast.

1424
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:05,079
<i>I knew my ancestors
were behind me, supporting me.</i>

1425
01:18:05,081 --> 01:18:06,814
<i>And that is something
I can't even fathom,</i>

1426
01:18:06,881 --> 01:18:08,949
<i>it's like it gives me
so much joy</i>

1427
01:18:08,951 --> 01:18:12,553
<i>to know that they support me
and that I'm not alone.</i>

1428
01:18:12,555 --> 01:18:15,423
I'm different now than I was,
say even a week ago,

1429
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:18,025
before this investigation began,

1430
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:21,228
<i>because this taught me
more about humility,</i>

1431
01:18:21,296 --> 01:18:22,629
not just for myself,

1432
01:18:22,631 --> 01:18:25,566
but how we view others
and how others view us.

1433
01:18:26,435 --> 01:18:28,569
<i>I know everybody
wants that answer.</i>

1434
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:30,237
<i>Who done it?</i>

1435
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,241
<i>We will never know for sure</i>

1436
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:36,711
<i>who killed Abby
and Andrew Borden.</i>

1437
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:39,246
<i>If Lizzie committed
those murders,</i>

1438
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:43,717
<i>or if the dark energy conjured
from the family curse made her do it.</i>

1439
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:48,388
<i>Anvelo is the entity of
many faces and many names.</i>

1440
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:51,292
It's what we give it,
what we put into it.

1441
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:56,864
<i>I believe Anvelo
was this dark guardian</i>

1442
01:18:56,866 --> 01:18:58,999
<i>of the Borden murder house.</i>

1443
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:02,603
<i>And I believe it was there
for a time,</i>

1444
01:19:02,605 --> 01:19:05,439
<i>but I think it was forced out.</i>

1445
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:10,611
<i>The house felt different,
like a weight had been lifted.</i>

1446
01:19:10,613 --> 01:19:14,615
<i>We brought peace, not only
to the Borden family in a certain way,</i>

1447
01:19:14,617 --> 01:19:16,750
but also we brought peace
to many other spirits

1448
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:19,953
that have come through
that house, or still remain.

1449
01:19:19,955 --> 01:19:24,191
<i>What matters really, is
that they find peace in the afterlife.</i>

1450
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:28,362
<i>So with that,
I'm extremely grateful.</i>

1451
01:19:28,364 --> 01:19:31,298
<i>There's one last thing
we have to do,</i>

1452
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:35,069
<i>to pay honor to Lizzie, at the
home where she finally passed away.</i>

1453
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:37,138
<i>Maplecroft.</i>

1454
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:44,678
<i>After Lizzie was
acquitted for the murders,</i>

1455
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:46,880
<i>she and her sister, Emma,
left the family home,</i>

1456
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:48,816
<i>and moved just over a mile away,</i>

1457
01:19:48,818 --> 01:19:50,951
<i>where Lizzie spent
the rest of her days.</i>

1458
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:55,689
<i>Lizzy died in 1927 at age 66,</i>

1459
01:19:55,757 --> 01:19:58,559
<i>and days later,
Emma died in New Hampshire.</i>

1460
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:03,030
<i>And as we enter the home,</i>

1461
01:20:03,097 --> 01:20:06,967
<i>we can already feel the light after
the dark seance the night before.</i>

1462
01:20:10,572 --> 01:20:12,105
<i>Connecting with Elizabeth,</i>

1463
01:20:12,107 --> 01:20:15,109
she's waiting at the stairs
to lead us upstairs.

1464
01:20:15,176 --> 01:20:17,044
She's got a little bit
of an edge to her,

1465
01:20:17,046 --> 01:20:19,413
but she still is grateful
that we're here.

1466
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:25,452
When I first came to Maplecroft,

1467
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,122
this is where I connected
with her the first time.

1468
01:20:28,189 --> 01:20:33,194
And I picture a woman
looking out the window,

1469
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:35,196
people mocking her
on the streets.

1470
01:20:35,263 --> 01:20:38,065
You know like, "You did it,
you did it," and her crying.

1471
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:41,401
There is a lot of sadness
here, but a lot of joy as well.

1472
01:20:41,403 --> 01:20:44,071
This was her sanctuary. This
is where she threw parties,

1473
01:20:44,138 --> 01:20:45,583
and this is where
she kind of lived her life.

1474
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:48,108
And she became the person
she wanted to be.

1475
01:20:49,611 --> 01:20:51,612
<i>It's like after the murders,</i>

1476
01:20:51,614 --> 01:20:55,082
<i>the whole city
just turned against her.</i>

1477
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:59,687
<i>It was a big thing for kids
to play pranks on her,</i>

1478
01:20:59,754 --> 01:21:01,688
<i>throw rocks at the window.</i>

1479
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:06,093
It was a thing for the kids
to actually go up to this door,

1480
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:08,295
<i>knock on the door and run away.</i>

1481
01:21:08,297 --> 01:21:11,198
<i>So she'd come and open the
door and no one would be there.</i>

1482
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:15,236
<i>To be alive during
that time, to hear these things,</i>

1483
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:17,170
even though
you've been acquitted,

1484
01:21:17,172 --> 01:21:20,040
you believe yourself
to be innocent of this crime.

1485
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:21,775
It's interesting,
she took a stand.

1486
01:21:21,777 --> 01:21:23,688
She could have run.
She could have gone anywhere.

1487
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,246
She had the money.

1488
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:28,782
<i>But this was her home, and
she just moved blocks away,</i>

1489
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:32,519
<i>resettled in the place she
knew as home, and owned it.</i>

1490
01:21:32,587 --> 01:21:34,988
<i>And that's...
you gotta give her that.</i>

1491
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:38,459
If anything lends to the idea
that she was innocent,

1492
01:21:38,526 --> 01:21:41,262
or at least believed herself
to be innocent of this crime,

1493
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:44,164
why would you run,
if you feel you're innocent?

1494
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:47,534
When I first
communicated with her,

1495
01:21:47,536 --> 01:21:50,070
she mentioned the pears,
and there was a pear tree

1496
01:21:50,138 --> 01:21:52,940
in the backyard of
the Second Street home.

1497
01:21:52,942 --> 01:21:55,809
And we're gonna offer
a pear to Elizabeth.

1498
01:21:55,877 --> 01:21:58,145
We also have some old school,

1499
01:21:58,147 --> 01:22:00,948
dark chocolates for her as well.

1500
01:22:01,015 --> 01:22:04,418
And we're gonna leave it at the
spot where she, where she passed.

1501
01:22:06,888 --> 01:22:09,423
So this part of the house here

1502
01:22:09,490 --> 01:22:12,226
was where Elizabeth
lived later in life.

1503
01:22:12,293 --> 01:22:15,763
And when I see her,
I see her in this room.

1504
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:17,564
This is her sanctuary.

1505
01:22:17,566 --> 01:22:19,433
This is the area
where she was sleeping

1506
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:21,402
when she passed peacefully.

1507
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:26,106
<i>Did she ever find
happiness in her life?</i>

1508
01:22:27,575 --> 01:22:31,078
<i>In my thoughts,
I believe that she did.</i>

1509
01:22:32,246 --> 01:22:35,049
<i>She was able to express
herself through music.</i>

1510
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:37,584
<i>She loved music,
she loved animals,</i>

1511
01:22:37,586 --> 01:22:40,187
<i>and she took what came
into her life,</i>

1512
01:22:40,189 --> 01:22:43,523
<i>the money that came
from the deaths in her family,</i>

1513
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:46,059
and actually gave a lot
of money to help animals,

1514
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:48,595
and that's something that,
when I came into this house,

1515
01:22:48,597 --> 01:22:51,432
I learned about
a different cousin.

1516
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:53,067
Elizabeth,
I just want to thank you

1517
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:55,202
for allowing us into your story.

1518
01:22:55,269 --> 01:22:58,672
And I hope that we did
justice for you in doing so.

1519
01:22:58,674 --> 01:23:01,875
I hope that with
what we were able to do,

1520
01:23:01,943 --> 01:23:04,077
we can bring some peace
to you and your family,

1521
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:07,347
and you can all finally get
the rest that you deserve.

1522
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:10,117
Keep hearing whispering,
like, "Thank you, thank you."

1523
01:23:11,753 --> 01:23:13,286
You know,
we did something last night

1524
01:23:13,288 --> 01:23:16,590
at the other house that
I'd like to wrap up with here.

1525
01:23:16,592 --> 01:23:17,925
And it's just a quick prayer.

1526
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:24,331
Lord, we just ask that you
surround this house in healing,

1527
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:26,400
and a thorny hedge
of protection,

1528
01:23:26,402 --> 01:23:30,404
to keep it safe and the
souls that reside here safe.

1529
01:23:30,406 --> 01:23:33,874
<i>Please open the gateways,
bring forth the light,</i>

1530
01:23:33,941 --> 01:23:37,611
<i>bring forth family members
in peace and forgiveness,</i>

1531
01:23:37,678 --> 01:23:40,514
<i>so that any spirits that are
lost may find their way home.</i>

1532
01:23:41,883 --> 01:23:44,885
<i>We beg of you to give peace
to the Borden family,</i>

1533
01:23:44,952 --> 01:23:48,956
<i>their ancestors and to lift
the curse of the Borden family.</i>

1534
01:24:10,445 --> 01:24:17,184
<i>♪ Lizzie Borden took an ax
and gave her mother 40 whacks ♪</i>

1535
01:24:17,186 --> 01:24:22,489
