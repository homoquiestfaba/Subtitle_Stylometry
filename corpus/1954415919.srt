WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

26
00:04:24,547 --> 00:04:26,549
WHAT'S WRONG WITH
ME BEING HERE ?

27
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:28,050
HOW DID YOU KNOW
WHERE I WORKED ?

28
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:29,552
DOUG.

29
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:31,554
UH, MR. LANGLEY,
HOW ARE YOU ? EXCUSE ME A MOMENT.

30
00:04:31,554 --> 00:04:33,556
SIR, I'M SORRY.

31
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:36,058
THIS BROAD, I SLEEP WITH
HER ONCE, AND SHE THINKS SHE CAN FOLLOW ME TO WORK.

32
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:37,560
BUT I'LL TAKE CARE
OF IT. DON'T WORRY.

33
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,562
DOUG, THAT BROAD

KISS MY ASS, JOE.

37
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,792
EASY, DAWG.

38
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,794
NO, "EASY" THIS.

39
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,380
SCREW THEM.
SCREW R.P. LANGLEY.

40
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,499
YOU ALREADY SCREWED
HIS WIFE.

41
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,502
I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS HIS WIFE.

42
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,003
I WISH I HAD KNOWN
IT WAS HIS WIFE.

43
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,637
WOULD HAVE MADE IT
MORE EXCITING.

44
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,139
( chuckling )

45
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,725
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
HE CAN LICK ME. CRACK TO SACK, OK ?

46
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,395
R.P. LANGLEY CAN LICK ME,
CRACK TO FUCKING SACK.

47
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,980
HEY, HEY, NOT IN
FRONT OF THE LADY.

48
00:05:16,265 --> 00:05:18,433
SORRY, TOUGH WEEK.

49
00:05:18,434 --> 00:05:20,602
THAT'S NO EXCUSE FOR
CURSING LIKE THAT.

50
00:05:20,603 --> 00:05:22,488
IT'S IMPORTANT
FOR DECENT PEOPLE

51
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,323
TO CONTROL
THEIR LANGUAGE.

52
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:28,277
MOTHERFUCKING SON OF
A BITCH, YOU'RE HOT !

53
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:30,495
SO ARE YOU.
INCREDIBLE.

54
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,497
TAKE YOUR PANTIES OFF.

55
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,998
OH, NO, NOT YET.

NO.

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,501
COME ON,
I'M DEPRESSED, MMM.

58
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,504
SEX IS LIKE MEDICATION.
IT'LL HELP EASE THE PAIN, MMM.

59
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,256
WHY ARE YOU DEPRESSED ?
YOU'LL FIND ANOTHER JOB.

60
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,259
IT'S NOT REALLY
ABOUT MY JOB.

61
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,761
IT'S ABOUT
MY GRANDMOTHER, ACTUALLY.

62
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,764
AH.

63
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,766

65
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,271
WHAT ?

66
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,773
W-WHAT'S WRONG ?

67
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,776
YOU'RE--YOU'RE USING
YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S DEATH

68
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,277
TO GET YOURSELF
A PIECE OF ASS.

69
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,279
THAT IS SO DEMENTED.

70
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,813
NO, WAIT, WAIT.

71
00:06:04,814 --> 00:06:07,316
SEE, I'M SOMEONE WHO
CAN CHANNEL DEPRESSION THROUGH SEXUAL ENERGY.

72
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:08,317
BELIEVE ME, I'M
IN REAL MOURNING.

73
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:09,819
YOU'RE FUCKING SICK.

74
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:11,320
NO, AND I ONLY NEED
4 HOURS OF SLEEP.

75
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,655
IT'S A FUNERAL. HOW
AWAKE DO YOU HAVE TO BE ? WHERE'RE YOU GOING ?

NICE TO MEET YOU.

135
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,099
YOU'RE NOT RELATED
TO ME, ARE YOU ?

136
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,100
OH, HARDLY, NO.

137
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,601
I'M YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S
ATTORNEY

138
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:31,103
AND THE EXECUTOR
OF HER ESTATE.

139
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,938
LOOK, I WANNA MAKE
THIS REALLY BRIEF,

140
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,942
'CAUSE I KNOW THIS
ISN'T THE TIME OR PLACE TO CONDUCT BUSINESS

141
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,444
AND, WELL, I IMAGINE
YOU MUST BE PRETTY...

142
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:40,863
I AM. I AM.
BUT MY STRATEGY IS TO LAY LOW

143
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,364
AND HANG OUT BY
THE FOOD TABLE,

144
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:45,368
BECAUSE, UH, USUALLY
WHEN YOU'RE EATING, PEOPLE DON'T BOTHER YOU.

145
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:46,202
USUALLY.

146
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:47,620
OH, I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO--

147
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,588
NO, RELAX, I'M JUST
MESSING WITH YOU.

148
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,425
ACTUALLY, UH, THE TRUTH
IS EVENTUALLY EVERY GOOD-LOOKING WOMAN

149
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,926
IN THE PLACE WILL END
UP AT THE FOOD TABLE

150
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,178
BECAUSE WOMEN LIKE TO
EAT WHEN THEY'RE SAD.

151
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,179
REALLY ?
YEAH.

152
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,547
AND WHAT DO
MEN DO ?

153
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:00,432
WE LOOK FOR SAD WOMEN.

154
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:03,936

155
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:04,886

WHY ?

159
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,813
WELL, LET ME PUT
IT THIS WAY.

160
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,031
YOUR GRANDMOTHER WAS WORTH
A LOT MORE THAN YOU THINK.

161
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,951
IN FACT, SHE WAS WORTH
MORE THAN ANYBODY THOUGHT.

162
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,953
AND OUT OF ALL HER
IMMEDIATE FAMILY,

163

165
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:27,076
FOR SOME REASON,

166
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:29,578
YOURS IS THE ONLY NAME
THAT APPEARS ON THE WILL.

167
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,633
MR. MENFORD ?

168
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,003
UH--UH, HOW MUCH EXACTLY
IS SHE WORTH ?

169
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,005
1:00, MONDAY.

170
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,509
OK.

171
00:10:49,432 --> 00:10:52,435
I'M HERE
ABOUT THE COFFEE TABLE. SOLID OAK.

172
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,987

00:20:21,837 --> 00:20:23,839
MY JOB IS TO WITNESS THAT.

353
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,841
THEREFORE, I HAVE
TO BE PRESENT.

354
00:20:26,842 --> 00:20:27,843
AH !

355
00:20:27,843 --> 00:20:29,845
ALL RIGHT, GODDAMIT,
LET'S GET IT OVER WITH.

356
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:32,347
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO START A RELATIONSHIP WITH TRUST.

357
00:20:32,347 --> 00:20:34,349
LEAST YOU COULD GIVE ME
THE BENEFIT OF DOUBT.

358
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:35,850
RELATIONSHIP ?

359
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:38,353
BY YOUR ADMISSION, YOU
DON'T EVEN KNOW THE MEANING OF THE WORD.

360
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:39,437
VERY FUNNY.

361
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,941
( sighing )

362
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,944
WELL ?

363
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,947
I'M JUST REFLECTING
ON MY GRANDMOTHER'S KEEN SENSE OF HUMOR.

364
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:51,950
( sighing )

365
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:55,336
HEY, EASY, SHE
MIGHT HEAR YOU.

366
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:02,343
( door opening )

367
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,513
OH, MAN, NO WAY !

368
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,298
HI, MEGAN.

369
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,549
DOUG MENFORD ?

370
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:08,516
YEAH, IT'S ME.

371
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:09,934
UH, THIS IS ANNA.

372
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,436
HI.

373
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,438
HOLY SHIT !

374
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,441
WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT THAT
ALMOST 6 YEARS AFTER RAPPING BACKSTAGE WITH THE BEASTIES,

375
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,942
YOU'D BE KNOCKING
ON MY DOOR ?

376
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,894
DO YOU REMEMBER
THE BEASTIE ACRONYM ?

377
00:21:19,895 --> 00:21:21,396
UH...

378
00:21:21,396 --> 00:21:23,114
BOYS ENTERING

379
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,450
ANARCHISTIC STATES
TOWARDS INTERNAL--

380
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,151
EXCELLENCE.

381
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,404
MAN, THIS IS SO WEIRD.

382
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,489
YEAH.

383
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:35,043
DO YOU MIND
IF WE COME IN ?

384
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,828
NO !

385
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,830
I MEAN, UH, NO,
PLEASE DO.

386
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,498
( laughing )

387
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,387
JEEZ.

388
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,173
EXCUSE THE MESS.
IT'S JUST ME AND MY FRIENDS.

389
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,974
( cats mewing )

390
00:21:50,258 --> 00:21:52,226
WE DON'T GET
MANY VISITORS.

391
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,229
PLEASE,

392
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:57,232
PLEASE MAKE YOURSELF
COMFORTABLE. HAVE A SEAT.

393
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,655
SO, TELL ME ALREADY,

394
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,909
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE ?

395
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,194
WELL, I--I--I
NEEDED TO SEE YOU.

396
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,497
YEAH, RIGHT.

397
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,664
NO, SERIOUSLY.

398
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,949
WHY ?

399
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:15,784
OH !

400
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:17,702
GET DOWN, "H" !

401
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,204
"H" ?

402
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,004
IS THAT SHORT
FOR SOMETHING ?

403
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:21,873
NO, IT'S HER NAME.

404
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:24,375
TO KEEP THINGS EASY,
I JUST ASSIGN THEM ALL LETTERS.

405
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,378
IT GETS TO BE KIND
OF A BITCH, THOUGH.

406
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,381
"B" SOMETIMES COMES
WHEN I CALL "P."

407
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,516
"M" ANSWERS TO "N."

408
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,434
UH-HUH.

409
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,937
SO, YOU WERE SAYING
YOU NEEDED TO SEE ME ?

410
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,355
UM...

411
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,357
( cat yowling )

412
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:41,809
CAN I HAVE A DRINK ?

413
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,311
MAN,

414
00:22:43,311 --> 00:22:45,279
I AM SO RUDE !

415
00:22:46,982 --> 00:22:47,899
ANNA ?

416
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,283
OH, NO, NOT
FOR ME, THANKS.

417
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,118
DOUG ?

418
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,569
JAGER AND COKE.

419
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,876
THE WOMAN'S INSANE,
HOW COULD YOU HAVE HAD SEX WITH HER ?

420
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,377
SHE WASN'T CRAZY WHEN
I HAD SEX WITH HER.

421
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,380
SHE DIDN'T HAVE
ANY CATS, EITHER.

422
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,883
NO. NO, YOU CAN HELP
OUT HERE, OK, IF YOU'RE GONNA SIT HERE IN THE ROOM,

423
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,384
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
THROW IN A LITTLE--

424
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,187
OH, SURE, DO IT ALL
FOR YOU. WOULDN'T THAT RATHER DEFEAT-- HEY.

425
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,723
THANK YOU. THANK
YOU VERY MUCH.

426
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,225
I APPRECIATE IT.

427
00:23:15,343 --> 00:23:16,594
MEGAN,

428
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:17,762
UH-HUH.

429
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:22,100
UH, ANNA HERE IS ACTUALLY
MY A.A. COACH.

430
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,184
HMM ?

431
00:23:23,185 --> 00:23:24,186
YEAH.

432
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,442
ACTUALLY, A--A SPECIAL
PROGRAM THAT I'M IN,

433
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,444
IT'S A NEW THING WHERE
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE, UH,

434
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:33,445
3 DRINKS,

435
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:34,446
AHEM,

436
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,448
A DAY,

437
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,834
FOR 3 WEEKS, YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE WE LEAD SUCH...

438
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,587
HURTFUL LIVES, REALLY,
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

439
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,706
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, JUST
COMING AND GOING. WE LAY WASTE OUR TIME.

440
00:23:45,707 --> 00:23:47,208
IT'S WHAT WE DO AND--

441
00:23:47,209 --> 00:23:48,210
MR. MENFORD.

442
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,461
CATHARSIS.
DOUG.

443
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:52,297
LIKE--LIKE O-OLD
RELATIONSHIPS, FOR INSTANCE.

444
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,299
YOU KNOW, WE--WE-- SOMETIMES
WE SAY AND DO THINGS,

445
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,801
WE DON'T REALIZE
HOW IT AFFECTS PEOPLE, YOU KNOW.

446
00:23:58,303 --> 00:23:59,804
AND, UH,

447
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,140
AND THAT'S THE THING.
FOR INSTANCE,

448
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,194
I--I--I HOPE I HAVEN'T
SAID THINGS IN THE PAST THAT MIGHT HAVE HURT YOU.

449
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,696
I LIKE THE THINGS
YOU SAID,

450
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,531
WHEN WE TALKED.

451
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,481
YES.

452
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,400
BUT, SEE, YOU'RE MAKING
IT EASY FOR ME,

453
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,901
AND I WANT IT TO BE HARD.

454
00:24:13,902 --> 00:24:15,904
I WANT TO... I WANT
TO FEEL THE PAIN.

455
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:18,456
I WANT IT TO--
I WANT IT TO HURT. I WANT IT TO HAVE...

456
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,574
DEEPER MEANING, REALLY.

457
00:24:19,908 --> 00:24:20,792
( gasping )

458
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:25,964
OH, NO.

459
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,465
OH, MY GOD !

460
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,800
( Megan gasping )

461
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,469
THIS HAS BEEN AROUND
FOR 3 GENERATIONS.

462
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,337
OH, REALLY ?

463
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,556
MY GRANDMOTHER HANDED
THIS DOWN TO MY MOTHER,

464
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,927
AND MY MOTHER PASSED
IT ON TO ME.

465
00:24:38,927 --> 00:24:42,096
THIS IS A RILEY HEIRLOOM.

466
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,817
I'M SO SORRY.
OH, I...

467
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,820
I COULDN'T BE SORRIER
EVEN IF I WAS SORRIER.

468
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,189
YOU ARE VERY SORRY,
MR. MENFORD.

469
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,157
YES, I AM.
I'M EXTREMELY SORRY.

470
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,161
I'M--I'M TERRIBLY, HORRIBLY,
HORRIBLY SORRY ABOUT THIS.

471
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,163
AND HERE I WAS
MAKING AN APOLOGY,

472
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,665
AND IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE APOLOGY, I HAVE TO MAKE ANOTHER APOLOGY.

473
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,418
I'M SO APOLOGETIC RIGHT
NOW ABOUT HOW SORRY--

474
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,285
SHUT IT !

475
00:25:04,286 --> 00:25:07,255
SHUT THE FUCK
UP ABOUT IT !

476
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,839
I FORGIVE YOU !

477
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,625
OK.

478
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:13,260
WELL, WE GOT TO GO.
SEE YOU LATER.

479
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,763
SORRY.

480
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,265
( crying )

481
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,516
OH, OH.

482
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,101
YOU CHEATED.

483
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,303
YES, AND ?

484
00:25:22,304 --> 00:25:25,190
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
QUIT NOW AND FORGET ABOUT THE MILLION DOLLARS.

485
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,692
YOU CAN'T STAND
THAT I SCORED.

486
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,861
WHAT YOU DID BACK
THERE WAS DESPICABLE.

487
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,482
HEY, LOOK, YOU SAID NO
COLLUSION. YOU SAID NOTHING ABOUT CUTTING CORNERS.

488
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:36,984
CUTTING CORNERS IS CHEATING.

489
00:25:37,485 --> 00:25:40,488
HEY, BUT IF THAT'S THE
ROAD YOU WANNA GO, JUST KISS THE MONEY GOODBYE.

490
00:25:40,488 --> 00:25:43,541
YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS
WE'RE REDEFINING THE DEAL, LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT.

491
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,827
FROM NOW ON, YOU
STAY IN THE CAR.

492
00:25:45,827 --> 00:25:48,713
OK, YOU DO NOT
COME INSIDE. YOU STAY IN THE CAR. PERIOD.

493
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,002
THE PIN-DROP 3000 RECEIVER.

494
00:25:54,002 --> 00:25:57,305
WITHOUT A DOUBT, THIS
REPRESENTS THE CUTTING EDGE IN AUDIOPHILIC TECHNOLOGY.

495
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,808
THE BAND
FREQUENCIES ACTUALLY...

496
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,143
BEND THE WAVES
WITHIN THE COCHLEA,

497
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:05,813
CAUSING THE EAR
ITSELF TO BECOME A CACOPHONIC RESONATOR.

498
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,817
ADDITIONALLY, THE RECEIVER
HAS A BUILT-IN MICROPHONE

499
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:13,354
WITH A TRANSMITTING CAPACITY
OF 15,000 UBERHERTZ.

500
00:26:13,355 --> 00:26:16,191
THE RATIO
OF CONDUCTION TO RECEPTION IS BEYOND COMPARE,

501
00:26:16,191 --> 00:26:19,444
SOMEWHERE WITHIN
THE GRAPHOLOGIC PARADIGM OF BEING...

502
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:20,862
( bird cawing )

503
00:26:21,863 --> 00:26:23,164
IN THE SAME ROOM.

504
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,784
FOR AN ADDITIONAL 3 DOLLARS,
I'LL THROW IN A FOUNTAIN PEN.

505
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:30,371
ON THE OTHER HAND--

506
00:26:30,372 --> 00:26:31,873
COULD YOU JUST GO BACK
TO THE BIT ABOUT THE--

507
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:33,007
WE'LL TAKE THEM.

508
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,759
HMM.

509
00:26:36,544 --> 00:26:37,678
( static )

510
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,098
CAN YOU SEE IT ?

511
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,599
NO, IT LOOKS GREAT.

512
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,601
OK, SO,

513
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,769
WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE
TO HEAR EACH OTHER

514
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,771
AND TALK TO EACH
OTHER IF WE NEED TO.

515
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,773
RIGHT. WHO'S NEXT ?

516
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,224
KIANA MORTENSON.

517
00:26:50,225 --> 00:26:51,476
OOH, KIANA !

518
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,452
( dog barking )

519
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,454
PERFECT. OK, NOW LET'S
TEST THIS EQUIPMENT.

520
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,956
YOU JUMP OUT OF THE CAR,
WALK A LITTLE BIT AWAY,

521
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:08,459
AND I AM GOING TO SAY,
"TESTING, TESTING," OK ?

522
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,961
TESTING.

523
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,462
TESTING.

524
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,464
TESTING.

525
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,465
TESTING !

526
00:27:17,252 --> 00:27:18,753
( drums beating )

527
00:27:23,258 --> 00:27:24,759
DOES IT WORK, THEN ?

528
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,562
MR. MENFORD ?

529
00:27:33,435 --> 00:27:34,569
OH, YES.

530
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,506
HEY !

531
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,375
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.

532
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,177
ALL YOU NEED IS THAT
PLACE DOWN THE CARIBBEAN, AND YOU'LL BE ALL SET.

533
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,181
YOU REMEMBERED.
LONG TIME NO SEE.

534
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,266
HOW ABOUT SOME ICED TEA ?

535
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,770
I MISSED YOU.

536
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,275
FIGURED I'D TAKE A SHOT AND
SEE IF YOU'RE STILL AROUND.

537
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:17,278
PART OF ME THOUGHT
YOU WOULD BE IN SAINT CROIX BY NOW, BUT...

538
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,280
ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED ?

539
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,151
( moaning )

540
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:26,537
<i>( Kiana screaming )</i>

541
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,574
WA-WA-WAIT ! I WANT
TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

542
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,831
( door creaking )

543
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,334
HOLY SHIT.

544
00:28:41,336 --> 00:28:42,837
I DID IT MYSELF.

545
00:28:42,837 --> 00:28:44,555
( bird cawing )

546
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,424
IT'S MY DREAM SPACE.

547
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,058
( grunting )

548
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,562
OH, OH.

549
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,564
( man singing Spanish )

550
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,732
( groaning )

551
00:28:56,851 --> 00:28:58,652
( shrieking )

552
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,404
OH, NO.

553
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,107
I'LL GET IT, I'LL GET IT.

554
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,743
OH, NO. I HAVE IT.
GIVE IT TO ME.

555
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,578
HERE WE GO.

556
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,079
LET ME DO IT !
OK.

557
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,080
LET ME DO IT !

558
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,699
GOOD, GOOD.

559
00:29:11,699 --> 00:29:13,417
( grunting )

560
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,086
HELP ME.
I AM.

561
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,036
OK, WAIT...

562
00:29:16,037 --> 00:29:17,538
OK.
OK.

563
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,257
UP ! UP...

564
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,758
WHAT, WHAT'S WRONG ?

565
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,293
I WANT TO BE ON TOP.

566
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:25,797
OK.

567
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:27,298
<i>Ok. All right, go, go.</i>

568
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:28,599
GO THIS WAY.

569
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,018
ALL RIGHT.

570
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:34,688
WAIT, WAIT. ON THE
COUNT OF 3. 1, 2, 3.

571
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,641
DID YOU SAY "3" YET ?

572
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:37,642
YEAH, I DID.

573
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,026
OK, 3, ROLL.

574
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,478
I'M TRYING TO ROLL.

575
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:41,779
PULL MY BUTT !

576
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,897
OH, YEAH.

577
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,200
( both )
AH.

578
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:46,484
AH.

579
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:48,569
KIANA...

580
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,454
WHAT ?

581
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,955
SORRY, I--I--I...

582
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,457
OH, OW, OW.

583
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,911
SORRY FOR LEAVING
YOU IN THE THEATRE.

584
00:29:56,911 --> 00:29:59,330
I SHOULD HAVE
GOTTEN THE POPCORN AND COME BACK.

585
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,631
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

586
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,799
( groaning )

587
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,251
OH, MY GOD !

588
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:05,002
( moaning )

589
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,506
( screaming )

590
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,808
( grunting )

591
00:30:11,593 --> 00:30:12,594
AH.

592
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:15,096
I FORGIVE YOU.

593
00:30:16,097 --> 00:30:17,431
( sighing )

594
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:18,816
OH,

595
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,318
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

596
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,320
RIGHT.

597
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,824
( engine starting )

598
00:30:35,617 --> 00:30:36,618
OH, SHIT !

599
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:39,420
( car horn honking )

600
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,758
( sighing )

601
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,689
VERY FUNNY.

602
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,109
SERVES YOU RIGHT.

603
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,111
WHAT ARE YOU
DOIN' UP HERE ?

604
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,613
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA DO THIS ONE WITH DECENCY.

605
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,031
TRUST ME, SHE'S
NOT MAD, OK ?

606
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,532
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT ?

607
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,536
BECAUSE SHE LOVES SEX
AS MUCH AS I DO, OK ?

608
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:16,040
SEX IS JUST AN
ACTIVITY TO YOU, ISN'T IT ?

609
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,041
NO.

610
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:21,128
SEX IS A BIG, GIANT PARTY.

611
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,381
YEAH, WELL, IT'S MORE
THAN THAT TO WOMEN. I CAN ASSURE YOU.

612
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,383
YOU HAVE SEX WITH
THE SAME WOMAN LONG ENOUGH,

613
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,168
SHE WANTS TO
HAVE YOUR BABY.

614
00:31:27,168 --> 00:31:30,421
REVELATION ! DOUG MENFORD
IS TERRIFIED OF CHILDREN.

615
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:31,756
I'M NOT
FRIGHTENED OF CHILDREN,

616
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:33,758
I LOVE THEM,
I JUST DON'T WANT TO HAVE THEM.

617
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,561
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.
ONE'S A PHOBIA, THE OTHER ONE IS A CHOICE.

618
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,563
I THINK YOU'RE THE
MOST SEXIST, SHALLOW,

619
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,315
SELF-CENTERED MAN I'VE EVER
HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO MEET.

620
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,102
SHE WAS HORNY, I WAS THERE.
IT'S CALLED TIMING.

621
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,987
YOU MEAN SHE JUST
HAD SEX WITH YOU

622
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,571
WITHOUT GIVING IT
A SECOND THOUGHT ?

623
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:48,572
PRETTY MUCH.

624
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,074
I THINK THAT'S
SAD AND WEAK.

625
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,609
I THINK YOU HAVE,
A: A PROBLEM WITH

626
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,412
SEXUAL WOMEN, OR
B: A PROBLEM WITH SEX.

627
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,414
I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH YOU.

628
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,915
I DIDN'T SPEND
YEARS IN LAW SCHOOL

629
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,918
JUST SO I COULD
FOLLOW YOU AROUND,

630
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,787
DOCUMENTING YOUR SEXUALLY
DEVIANT BEHAVIOR.

631
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:06,340
HEY, TAKE THAT STUPID GRIN
OFF YOUR FACE AND DRIVE, OK.

632
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,625
LET'S GO, SHALL WE ?

633
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,741
( horse neighing )

634
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,147
( inaudible )

635
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,766
( inaudible )

636
00:33:11,272 --> 00:33:12,773
( beeping )

637
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:14,942
( cell phone ringing )

638
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,198
( inaudible )

639
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:22,366
( inaudible )

640
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:54,949
HEY !

641
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,402
HEY, YOU GUYS.

642
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,405
( girls together )
WE FORGIVE YOU !

643
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:02,407
( laughing )

644
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,892
GOOD EVENING.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

645
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,394
I CAME TO CELEBRATE.

646
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,397
WELL, ISN'T THAT
A BIT PREMATURE ?

647
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,898
I DON'T THINK SO.

648
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,401
I'M OFF TO A GOOD START.

649
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,903
I'VE GOT 2 DAYS
TO GET 5 MORE. SO...

650
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,406
LET'S HAVE A DRINK.

651
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:36,908
I'M WORKING.

652
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,410
JUST ONE. TAKE A BREAK.

653
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,780
I THINK I'LL PASS.

654
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,784
SO, WHAT'S YOUR DEAL ?

655
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:51,588
I MEAN, THERE MUST BE
MORE TO ANNA LOCKHEART THAN BOOKS AND BUSINESS.

656
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,090
WHAT WOULD I FIND
LISTED UNDER HOBBIES ?

657
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,293
BETTER YET, WHAT WOULD
I FIND LISTED UNDER SKILLS ?

658
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:58,012
MAYBE YOU'LL
FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR UNDER...

659
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:00,297
MARITAL STATUS.

660
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:01,382
YOU'RE MARRIED.

661
00:35:01,382 --> 00:35:03,384
HAPPILY. HIS NAME'S COLE.

662
00:35:03,384 --> 00:35:04,768
COLE.

663
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:07,521
WHERE'S THE RING ?

664
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:11,025
OH, GETTING RESET. ONE
OF THE PRONGS BROKE.

665
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,026
EXCUSE ME.

666
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,528
OH, REALLY ?

667
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,030
GENTLE REMINDER,
MR. MENFORD

668
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,032
I'M HERE BECAUSE
I MADE A PROMISE

669
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,534
TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER,
WHO WAS A SWEET AND LOVELY WOMAN.

670
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,538
AND THE WHOLE PURPOSE
OF THIS EXPEDITION WAS TO HUMBLE YOU, TO TAME YOUR EGO,

671
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,623
NOT TO BLOW IT OUT
OF ALL PROPORTION.

672
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,992
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT
TO MY GRANDMOTHER, SCREW THAT.

673
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,495
'CAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE LUCKY 7s NOW.

674
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:31,996
YOU'RE REALLY ENJOYING
THIS, AREN'T YOU ?

675
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:33,498
YES, I AM.

676
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:36,501
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
GO AND ENJOY IT IN YOUR OWN ROOM ?

677
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,002
OK.

678
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:41,005
WELL, HERE'S TO 7 FOR 7.

679
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,431
( train horn blowing )

680
00:36:04,445 --> 00:36:05,946
( car tires screeching )

681
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,510
( people chattering )

682
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:30,888
LISTEN, THIS LAYOUT
JUST ISN'T WORKING.

683
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:34,808
WOW !

684
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:36,060
HI, CHRISTINE.

685
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,062
EXCUSE ME, LADIES.

686
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:41,281
HONEY, THIS IS
DOUG MENFORD.

687
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,701
DOUG MENFORD,
THE EXPERIMENT.

688
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,286
DON'T WORRY, BROTHER,
IT'S ALL GOOD.

689
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:50,291
I'M SORRY, DOUG, DID
I MISS THE REASON FOR YOUR UNSOLICITED VISIT ?

690
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,710
WELL, I--I WANTED
TO APOLOGIZE--

691
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,044
( laughing )

692
00:36:54,829 --> 00:36:56,130
OH, SHIT !

693
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,549
I'M GONNA KEEP THIS
BRIEF AND PAINFUL,

694
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,835
MUCH LIKE OUR
TIME TOGETHER.

695
00:37:00,835 --> 00:37:03,671
YOUR APOLOGY
IS NOT ACCEPTED.

696
00:37:04,171 --> 00:37:06,006
APPARENTLY, IT
AIN'T ALL GOOD.

697
00:37:06,007 --> 00:37:08,309
NO, BUT I--I REALLY JUST
WANTED TO SAY ONE--

698
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,936
EXPERIMENT ?

699
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:21,438
I TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF HER BRIEF IDENTITY CRISIS, OK.

700
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:22,690
I WAS HER MR. WHITE.

701
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,825
OOH, BAD CHOICE
ON HER PART GETTING YOU.

702
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,777
I'M BARELY OUT OF THE
BLOCKS ON DAY 2, AND I GET SCREWED BY A POLITICIAN.

703
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:28,779
THANK YOU MAYOR HODGES.

704
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,449
HEY, DON'T BE PATHETIC.
GET BACK IN THERE.

705
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:32,450

I LIKE THINGS NEAT AND
IN THEIR PROPER PLACE.

782
00:40:37,218 --> 00:40:40,221
THE PROPER PLACE FOR FOOD
IS IN YOUR STOMACH, OK ?

783
00:40:40,221 --> 00:40:42,606
NOT MARCHING AROUND YOUR
PLATE, SINGLE FILE.

784
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,108
THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID
FOR SELF-RESTRAINT, YOU KNOW.

785
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,727
SOMETIMES EVEN SELF-DENIAL.

801
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,134
WHO ARE YOU AND
WHAT AGENCY SENT YOU ?

802
00:42:01,135 --> 00:42:04,021
OH, NO. I'M--I'M
NOT FROM AN AGENCY.

00:46:50,942 --> 00:46:52,443
YOU SURE ?
POSITIVE.

886
00:46:52,944 --> 00:46:53,644
OK.

887
00:46:57,065 --> 00:46:58,483
DO YOU EVER STOP EATING ?

888
00:46:58,483 --> 00:46:59,734
NOPE.

889
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:02,737
PERFECTLY NORMAL
BODILY FUNCTION. OR DON'T YOU HAVE THOSE ?

890
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:06,240
LISTEN, IF YOU DON'T
FIND A BATHROOM, I MAY HAVE ONE RIGHT HERE AND NOW.

891
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:10,411
<i>♪ LET'S MOVE BEFORE THEY</i>
<i>RAISE THE PARKING RATE ♪</i>

892
00:47:10,412 --> 00:47:11,913
<i>♪ ALL RIGHT NOW ♪</i>

893
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:13,748
HOW'S IT GOIN' ?

894
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:18,469
YOU EVER TRIED STANDING
UP ? IT'S EASIER. MORE NATURAL, TOO.

895
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:22,640
<i>♪ ALL RIGHT NOW, BABY,</i>
<i>IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW ♪</i>

896
00:47:22,641 --> 00:47:24,643
YOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S FACE
IT. WE ARE INSANELY LOST.

897
00:47:25,143 --> 00:47:26,060
NO, WE'RE NOT.

898
00:47:26,061 --> 00:47:28,563
WELL, IF WE'RE NOT LOST,
HOW COME WE'VE PASSED

899
00:47:28,563 --> 00:47:31,182
THAT SAME LITTLE PILE
OF STONES 80 TIMES ?

900
00:47:31,183 --> 00:47:32,184
WE HAVEN'T.

901
00:47:32,184 --> 00:47:34,736
LOOK, IT SAYS IN
THE MAP THAT WE--

902
00:47:37,155 --> 00:47:38,656
OH,

903
00:47:38,657 --> 00:47:42,160
DON'T TELL ME WE'RE
IN THE "MEN DON'T READ MAPS" PHASE.

904
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,578
NO, WE DON'T.

905
00:47:43,578 --> 00:47:45,246
AND MEN ALSO DON'T
ASK FOR DIRECTIONS.

906
00:47:45,247 --> 00:47:48,700
NO, WE DON'T. WE GIVE
DIRECTIONS TO WOMEN WHO ASK FOR THEM, OK ?

907
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,034
THAT'S PATHETIC.

908
00:47:50,452 --> 00:47:52,454
LET ME EXPLAIN
SOMETHING TO YOU, OK, ALL RIGHT ?

909
00:47:52,454 --> 00:47:56,458
A MAN IS A CLEAN, STRAIGHT
LINE. A WOMAN IS A WIGGLY CIRCLE, ALL RIGHT ?

910
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:58,460
WE HAVE A REAL
ONE-ON-ONE RELATIONSHIP

911
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,962
WITH REAL OBJECTS
IN THE REAL WORLD, ALL RIGHT ?

912
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:03,965
WE HAVE TOOLS, YOU HAVE
BOOKS. WE BUILD, YOU WATCH. CASE CLOSED !

913
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:05,299
( tire bursting )

914
00:48:19,781 --> 00:48:21,282
MR. MENFORD.

915
00:48:21,783 --> 00:48:23,284
YEAH.

916
00:48:23,285 --> 00:48:25,287
CAN I ASK YOU
A WIGGLY QUESTION ?

917
00:48:26,288 --> 00:48:27,789
SURE.

918
00:48:27,789 --> 00:48:31,793
DOES A FLAT TIRE QUALIFY
AS A REAL OBJECT IN A REAL WORLD ?

919
00:48:34,296 --> 00:48:35,297
AHEM.

920
00:48:43,805 --> 00:48:44,806
( phone beeping )

921
00:48:46,308 --> 00:48:47,809
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

922
00:48:47,809 --> 00:48:49,811
I'M CALLING A.A.A., OK ?

923
00:48:50,812 --> 00:48:52,313
DON'T BE SO
RIDICULOUS. HANG UP.

924
00:48:52,314 --> 00:48:53,815
WHAT ?
HANG UP.

925
00:48:53,815 --> 00:48:55,316
YOU HAVE
A BETTER IDEA ?

926
00:48:55,317 --> 00:48:56,184
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I DO.

927
00:49:05,243 --> 00:49:07,662
I THINK THAT'S SUPPOSED TO...

928
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,704
AHEM.

929
00:49:16,705 --> 00:49:18,039
( car doors closing )

930
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,207
ONWARDS.

931
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:52,907
GOOD NIGHT !

932
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:54,408
SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

933
00:50:20,568 --> 00:50:21,569
YEAH ?

934
00:50:21,569 --> 00:50:23,571
HAVE YOU
SEEN MY LUGGAGE ?

935
00:50:23,571 --> 00:50:25,072
NO.

936
00:50:25,073 --> 00:50:27,575
HEY, YOU'RE A
NATURAL MAN, GO NAKED !

937
00:51:18,626 --> 00:51:19,460
HI.

938
00:51:19,961 --> 00:51:21,078
HI.

939
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,831
MY NAME IS DOUG.

940
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:26,084
WHAT'S YOURS ?

941
00:51:26,084 --> 00:51:27,585
LINDSAY ANNE WICKMAN.

942
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:29,169
WOW, COOL NAME.

943
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:30,671
THANK YOU.

944
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:33,174
YOU WANT SOME HELP ?

945
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:34,675
SURE.

946
00:51:35,226 --> 00:51:36,477
MAY I COME OVER ?

947
00:51:36,478 --> 00:51:37,479
OK.

948
00:51:39,481 --> 00:51:40,482
OK.

949
00:51:41,483 --> 00:51:42,767
YOU CAN HOLD THIS.

950
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:43,768
ALL RIGHT.

951
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:46,520
YOU'RE SPILLING THEM.

952
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:47,522
OH !

953
00:51:47,522 --> 00:51:50,024
I DIDN'T REALIZE
THE TOP WAS ALL OPEN.

954
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:51,943
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
I JUST--

955
00:51:53,945 --> 00:51:54,946
OK.

956
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:00,952
THAT'S MOST OF THEM.

957
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:02,837
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
GIVE THAT BACK TO YOU.

958
00:52:02,837 --> 00:52:04,922
IT'S OK, I FORGIVE YOU.

959
00:52:06,424 --> 00:52:07,425
THANKS.

960
00:52:09,427 --> 00:52:11,595
SO WHOSE GARDEN IS THIS ?

961
00:52:11,596 --> 00:52:14,048
<i>Mine, but it used</i>
<i>to be my mommy's.</i>

962
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:16,550
IS HER NAME EMMA ?

963
00:52:16,551 --> 00:52:17,552
YES.

964
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:20,054
AND WHERE IS SHE ?

965
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:21,305
SHE DIED.

966
00:52:25,443 --> 00:52:26,727
<i>Where's your dad ?</i>

967
00:52:26,728 --> 00:52:28,396
I DON'T HAVE A DAD.

968
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,066
( Anna )
<i>You ok ?</i>

969
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:38,072
HOW OLD ARE YOU,
LINDSAY ?

970
00:52:38,573 --> 00:52:39,574
8.

971
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,076
AND WHAT'S YOUR
BIRTHDAY ?

972
00:52:42,577 --> 00:52:43,411
APRIL 13.

973
00:52:46,881 --> 00:52:47,882
1992.

974
00:52:49,918 --> 00:52:51,586
HOW DID YOU KNOW ?

975
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:53,421
WHO LIVES HERE
WITH YOU ?

976
00:52:53,922 --> 00:52:54,923
MY GRANDMA.

977
00:52:54,923 --> 00:52:55,924
( door opening )

978
00:52:56,141 --> 00:52:58,476
( Mrs. Wickman )
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING ?

979
00:52:58,476 --> 00:53:00,811
YOU ARE TRESPASSING.

980
00:53:00,812 --> 00:53:02,480
LINDSAY, YOU GET
INSIDE, RIGHT NOW.

981
00:53:02,981 --> 00:53:05,483
EXCUSE ME, I NEED TO,
UH, SPEAK WITH YOU.

982
00:53:06,985 --> 00:53:07,986
WHO ARE YOU ?

983
00:53:07,986 --> 00:53:10,438
MY NAME IS DOUG MENFORD.
I--I KNEW EMMA.

984
00:53:10,939 --> 00:53:11,940
OH.

00:53:12,941 --> 00:53:14,943
I'M SORRY, WE'RE BUSY.

986
00:53:18,163 --> 00:53:19,664
( birds chirping )

987
00:53:19,664 --> 00:53:21,449
( door closing )

988
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:24,452
WHAT HAPPENED
BACK THERE ?

989
00:53:24,452 --> 00:53:26,954
I THINK THAT
LITTLE GIRL IS MINE.

990
00:53:28,957 --> 00:53:32,460
I THINK IF SHE
WERE, HER MOTHER WOULD LET YOU KNOW.

991
00:53:35,763 --> 00:53:37,765
I'M NOT GOING TO
COUNT THIS ONE.

992
00:53:37,765 --> 00:53:39,767
COME ON, 2 MORE TO GO.

993
00:53:40,268 --> 00:53:41,719

994
00:54:20,725 --> 00:54:22,343
( door opening )

995
00:54:23,845 --> 00:54:25,346
( door slamming )

996
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:28,849
HELLO ?

997
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:33,854

998
00:54:33,855 --> 00:54:35,857
( man on P.A. )
<i>We don't open till 10:00.</i>

999
00:54:35,857 --> 00:54:37,358
UH, IS ERICA HERE ?

1000
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:38,359
<i>Erica ?</i>

1001
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:39,860
<i>( laughing )</i>

1002
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:41,362
<i>That's very funny.</i>

1003
00:54:41,362 --> 00:54:44,782
<i>Uh, Erica, you</i>
<i>got a visitor.</i>

1004
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:45,582
IS SHE HERE ?

1005
00:54:47,418 --> 00:54:48,419
DROP THE "A."

1006
00:54:48,419 --> 00:54:49,369
( Doug )
HUH ?

1007
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:50,871
I SAID, DROP THE "A."

1008
00:54:50,872 --> 00:54:51,672
FROM WHAT ?

1009
00:54:53,591 --> 00:54:55,092
"ERICA."

1010
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:58,762

1011
00:54:58,763 --> 00:55:00,714
ERIC KOYLE.

1012
00:55:01,015 --> 00:55:02,383
ERIC ?

1013
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:04,385
WELCOME TO MY CLUB, DOUG.

1014
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:07,772
I THINK I, UH,
NEED TO SIT DOWN.

1015
00:55:07,772 --> 00:55:09,223
YEAH, SURE.

1016
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:10,724
HEY !

00:55:10,725 --> 00:55:12,727
HEY, KILL THE LIGHTS,

1018
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:14,728

00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:21,235
CAN YOU BELIEVE
THAT SHIT ?

1022
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:22,736
GOD ! IT'S FUCKIN'
SURPRISING,

1023
00:55:22,737 --> 00:55:25,239
ESPECIALLY IN THIS
RIGHT-WING TOWN WE LIVE IN.

1024
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:26,240
( laughing )

1025
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:29,243
GOD, I CANNOT GET OVER
HOW GOOD YOU LOOK.

1026
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:32,246
LIKE A MILLION BUCKS.

1027
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:35,249
YOU KNOW, DOUG,
YOU ARE STILL A HOT PIECE OF ASS,

1028
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,753
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

1029
00:55:41,472 --> 00:55:43,474
( dance music playing )

1030
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:11,585
W-WHAT'S THE DEAL ?
DO YOU-- DO YOU-- NOW YOU LIKE WOMEN ?

1031
00:56:12,086 --> 00:56:13,504
YEAH, SOME ARE COOL.

1032
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:15,005
AND--AND YOU ALSO LIKE MEN ?

1033
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:18,258
I MEAN, I LIKED MEN
BEFORE. THERE'S REALLY NO REASON TO STOP NOW.

1034
00:56:18,259 --> 00:56:19,760
YEAH.

1035
00:56:19,761 --> 00:56:21,179
L-LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

1036
00:56:21,179 --> 00:56:23,181
OH, NO, NO, DON'T
TELL ME. DON'T TELL ME. LET ME GUESS.

1037
00:56:23,181 --> 00:56:24,682
YOU WANNA GO THROUGH
WITH IT, RIGHT ?

1038
00:56:24,682 --> 00:56:26,550
YEAH.

1039
00:56:26,551 --> 00:56:29,136
OK, LOOK, DOUG, I WAS SICK
OF BEING A FUCKING DOORMAT, FOR CHRIST'S SAKES !

1040
00:56:29,137 --> 00:56:31,939
I MEAN, YOU,
OF ALL PEOPLE, SHOULD KNOW THIS.

1041
00:56:31,939 --> 00:56:36,026
LET'S LEAVE ERICA
OUT OF THIS, RIGHT. THIS IS BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

1042
00:56:38,696 --> 00:56:40,197
I GOT AN IDEA.

1043
00:56:40,198 --> 00:56:41,449
WHAT ?

1044
00:56:41,449 --> 00:56:42,199
YOU WANNA SEE IT ?

1045
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,484
SEE WHAT ?

1046
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:44,368
MY BRAND-NEW DICK.

1047
00:56:46,788 --> 00:56:47,572
NOT REALLY. NO.

1048
00:56:47,572 --> 00:56:49,824
OH, COME ON. IT'S A REAL
CONVERSATION PIECE, DOUG.

1049
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:50,958
NO, NO, NO.

1050
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:52,409
COME ON, DOUG.
NO WAY.

1051
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:55,830
I REALLY DROPPED A LOT
OF COIN ON THIS DICK. HEY, LOU ! SPOT ME, LOU !

1052
00:56:58,666 --> 00:57:00,134
DOUG.

1053
00:57:00,134 --> 00:57:01,552
( Doug exclaiming )

1054
00:57:01,552 --> 00:57:02,386
NO.

1055
00:57:02,387 --> 00:57:03,721
COME ON, DOUG.
NO.

1056
00:57:03,721 --> 00:57:05,339
LOOK AT MY FUCKIN' DICK.

1057
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,841
OH, GOD. OK,
YOU HAPPY NOW ?

1058
00:57:07,842 --> 00:57:09,226
ISN'T IT A GOOD ONE ?

1059
00:57:09,227 --> 00:57:10,228
HOW THE HELL,
SHOULD I KNOW ?

1060
00:57:10,228 --> 00:57:13,014
ONLY BECAUSE I USED
YOUR DICK AS A MODEL.

1061
00:57:13,014 --> 00:57:14,148
OH, MY GOD.

1062
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:16,100
( microphone buzzing )

1063
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,102
REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME
I SUCKED YOU OFF ?

1064
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:20,487
YOU KNOW, THAT WAS MY
FIRST BLOWJOB EVER.

1065
00:57:20,488 --> 00:57:21,856
OH, GOD.

1066
00:57:22,323 --> 00:57:24,608
REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID TO ME
WHEN I ASKED YOU HOW IT WAS ?

1067
00:57:24,609 --> 00:57:25,526
LOOK--

1068
00:57:25,526 --> 00:57:27,578
YOU SAID, AND I QUOTE:

1069
00:57:27,578 --> 00:57:31,198
<i>"Don't worry, you'll</i>
<i>get the hang of it."</i>

1070
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:34,368
ALL RIGHT. I'M A LITTLE
FUCKED UP NOW. I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT'S HAPPENING.

1071
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:37,871
YEAH, WHICH IS ODD,
BECAUSE I'M DOING A LITTLE WONDERING MYSELF.

1072
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,209
WHY ARE YOU HERE ?

1073
00:57:41,209 --> 00:57:43,427
I THINK YOU SHOULD
TELL HER THE TRUTH.

1074
00:57:44,762 --> 00:57:47,264
I STAND TO INHERIT
A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY, IF I CAN GET

1075
00:57:47,265 --> 00:57:50,468
SOME OF MY FORMER GIRLFRIENDS
TO, UH, FORGIVE ME.

1076
00:57:50,468 --> 00:57:53,521
OH, SO THIS IS
ABOUT THE MONEY ?

1077
00:57:53,521 --> 00:57:56,023
I SEE, IT'S LIKE
A LITTLE BIZ TRANSACTION, HUH ?

1078
00:57:56,023 --> 00:57:59,526
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
DOUG, LET'S LET THE NEGOTIATIONS BEGIN.

1079
00:57:59,527 --> 00:58:01,645
WELL, I DON'T HAVE
A WHOLE LOT I CAN OFFER YOU RIGHT NOW.

1080
00:58:02,647 --> 00:58:04,148
OH, YES, YOU DO.

1081
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:06,450
COME HERE.

1082
00:58:09,036 --> 00:58:10,404
CLOSER.

1083
00:58:13,875 --> 00:58:15,126
HEY !
ON YOUR KNEES.

1084
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:16,410
OH, GOD.

1085
00:58:17,712 --> 00:58:18,713
AH !

1086
00:58:19,797 --> 00:58:21,298
I WANT--

1087
00:58:21,299 --> 00:58:22,667
I'M NOT GONNA BLOW YOU.

1088
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:24,968
I WANT YOU TO SEE
WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR YOUR FIRST TIME, DOUG.

1089
00:58:24,969 --> 00:58:26,170
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

1090
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:28,422
EXACTLY HOW MUCH DOES THIS
INHERITANCE MEAN TO YOU ?

1091
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:29,506
OH !

1092
00:58:29,507 --> 00:58:30,391
UH...

1093
00:58:30,391 --> 00:58:31,675
THIS IS NOT WHAT
IT LOOKS LIKE.

1094
00:58:31,676 --> 00:58:32,560
IT'S LOOKING PRETTY BAD.

1095
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,261
I'M--

1096
00:58:34,262 --> 00:58:35,813
WHAT IS THIS,
SOME KIND OF SICK JOKE OR SOMETHING ?

1097
00:58:36,147 --> 00:58:37,314
THAT'S, UH--

1098
00:58:37,315 --> 00:58:39,433
( clattering )

1099
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:40,984
YOU SON OF A BITCH
MOTHERFUCKER.

1100
00:58:40,985 --> 00:58:42,353
UGH !

1101
00:58:42,353 --> 00:58:43,737
WOW ! YOU CAN
REALLY THROW A PUNCH.

1102
00:58:43,738 --> 00:58:45,773
WHAT'S WRONG WITH
YOU ? FIGHT BACK !

1103
00:58:45,773 --> 00:58:46,774
I CAN'T.
SHE'S A GIRL.

1104
00:58:46,774 --> 00:58:48,158
SHE'S NOT A GIRL !
SHE'S A BOY.

1105
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:49,193
I'M A MAN !

1106
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:49,943
I CAN'T DO IT.

1107
00:58:49,944 --> 00:58:51,528
WELL, IF YOU CAN'T,
I CAN. HEY !

1108
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,281
UGH !

1109
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:56,033
RIGHT. YOU
FORGIVE HIM.

1110
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:57,534
( groaning )

1111
00:58:57,535 --> 00:58:58,536
( laughing )

1112
00:58:58,536 --> 00:59:00,037
UNBELIEVABLE.

1113
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:01,538
( grunting )

1114
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:03,090
( sighing )

1115
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:04,875
I FUCKING FORGIVE YOU, DOUG.

1116
00:59:05,376 --> 00:59:06,260
SEE ?

1117
00:59:06,761 --> 00:59:08,546
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
SATURDAY NIGHT ?

1118
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:11,932
( muzak playing )

1119
00:59:17,555 --> 00:59:19,056
( people muttering )

1120
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:34,788
COLE.

1121
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:52,389
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF I HADN'T COME

1122
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:54,392
AND RESCUED YOU ?

1123
00:59:55,893 --> 00:59:57,895
LET'S NOT THINK
ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.

1124
00:59:57,895 --> 00:59:58,896
OK.

1125
00:59:58,896 --> 00:59:59,897
WHAT TIME DO
YOU HAVE ?

1126
01:00:00,398 --> 01:00:02,900
UM, VERY NEARLY
HALF PAST 8:00.

1127
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,902
SO, ONE MORE TO GO.
AND THEN I CAN FINALLY

1128
01:00:05,403 --> 01:00:07,405
GET TO SPEND SOME
TIME WITH MY HUSBAND.

1129
01:00:26,674 --> 01:00:28,625
( thunder rumbling )

1130
01:01:08,883 --> 01:01:09,884
( knocking )

1131
01:01:13,387 --> 01:01:14,888
( sighing )

1132
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:20,061
H-HEY !

1133
01:01:20,061 --> 01:01:21,562
H-H-HEY !

1134
01:01:21,562 --> 01:01:23,564
IF IT ISN'T
MR. BIG-MAN-ON-CAMPUS.

1135
01:01:23,564 --> 01:01:25,432
HEY, BILLY, RIGHT ?

1136
01:01:25,433 --> 01:01:26,317
WILLIE.

1137
01:01:26,317 --> 01:01:28,819
( laughing )
IT'S WILLIE.

1138
01:01:28,819 --> 01:01:30,153
LOOK AT-- COME ON IN HERE.

1139
01:01:30,154 --> 01:01:32,573
COME ON, IT'S
RAINING OUT THERE. GET YOUR ASS IN HERE.

1140
01:01:33,574 --> 01:01:35,075
AH, HA !

1141
01:01:36,577 --> 01:01:37,578
YEAH.

1142
01:01:37,578 --> 01:01:39,079
SO, UH...

1143
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,081
YOUR SISTER AROUND ?

1144
01:01:40,581 --> 01:01:41,582
OH !

1145
01:01:41,582 --> 01:01:43,083
OH, OH-OH.

1146
01:01:43,584 --> 01:01:46,587
OH, THE BIG SHITTY CITY SUCKED
ALL THE SMALL-TOWN TALK OUT OF THE BOY, HUH ? HUH ?

1147
01:01:46,587 --> 01:01:48,088
( laughing )
YEAH.

1148
01:01:48,089 --> 01:01:50,591
YEAH, DARCY'S HERE.
SHE'S IN THE BACK.

1149
01:01:53,094 --> 01:01:54,595
CAN I TALK TO HER ?

1150
01:01:55,096 --> 01:01:57,098
SURE, WILL DO, OK.

1151
01:01:57,098 --> 01:01:58,099
( laughing )

1152
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,102
( thunder rumbling )

1153
01:02:03,104 --> 01:02:04,605
( sighing )

1154
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:19,620
( coughing )

1155
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:22,739
WELL, WELL, WELL.

1156
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,159
LOOK WHO WE GOT HERE.

1157
01:02:25,159 --> 01:02:26,660
IT'S LITTLE
DOUGIE MENFORD.

1158
01:02:27,161 --> 01:02:28,162
( giggling )

1159
01:02:28,162 --> 01:02:29,163
WHAT A SURPRISE.

1160
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:33,333
HOW ARE YOU
DOING, DARCE ?

1161
01:02:33,334 --> 01:02:36,003
COME OVER HERE NEXT
TO ME ON THE COUCH.

1162
01:02:46,097 --> 01:02:47,098
COMFY, HUH ?

1163
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,602
I MEAN, YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU GOT YOUR ASS KICKED.

1164
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:54,104
OH, YEAH, JUST
A LITTLE SCUFFLE.

1165
01:02:55,356 --> 01:02:56,657
YOU STILL LOOK GREAT.

1166
01:02:57,158 --> 01:02:58,159
THANKS.

1167
01:03:00,661 --> 01:03:02,162
HOW DO I LOOK ?

1168
01:03:02,663 --> 01:03:04,948
YOU LOOK, UH...

1169
01:03:04,949 --> 01:03:06,083
DIFFERENT.

1170
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:07,584
( coughing )

1171
01:03:10,504 --> 01:03:11,505
YOU ALL RIGHT ?

1172
01:03:14,091 --> 01:03:15,092
OH,

1173
01:03:15,092 --> 01:03:17,594
YEAH, I GOTTA
CATCH MY BREATH.

1174
01:03:17,595 --> 01:03:19,096
( chuckling )
WHOO !

1175
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:23,433
LONG TIME NO SEE,
HUH, DOUGIE.

1176
01:03:23,768 --> 01:03:24,769
YEAH.

1177
01:03:24,769 --> 01:03:26,270
WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN ?

1178
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:28,105
YOU KNOW, JUST AROUND.

1179
01:03:28,522 --> 01:03:30,023
YEAH.

1180
01:03:30,524 --> 01:03:32,943
WELL, THE LEAST YOU
COULD'VE DONE WAS TOLD ME YOU WERE LEAVING.

1181
01:03:33,944 --> 01:03:35,946
WELL, I--I HAD
TO GET OUT. I--

1182
01:03:35,946 --> 01:03:38,648
YOU CAN'T GROW
IF YOU STAY IN YOUR HOMETOWN.

1183
01:03:38,649 --> 01:03:40,984
I STAYED, AND
I GREW PLENTY.

1184
01:03:43,954 --> 01:03:45,956
I JUST THOUGHT YOU
WERE GOING THROUGH,

1185
01:03:45,956 --> 01:03:47,457
YOU KNOW, ONE OF
YOUR LITTLE PHASES,

1186
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:49,960
AND I LET YOU BE.

1187
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,963
AND BY THE TIME THE NEWS
GOT BACK TO ME THAT YOU MOVED, I MEAN, THAT--

1188
01:03:52,963 --> 01:03:55,799
THAT WAS IT,
YOU WERE ALREADY A COLLEGE MAN.

1189
01:03:57,251 --> 01:03:59,253
I WAS TRYING
TO FIND MYSELF.

1190
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:02,255
DID YOU ?

1191
01:04:04,625 --> 01:04:05,509
YEAH...

1192
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:08,262
SO MUCH FOR
SOUL-SEARCHING, HUH ?

1193
01:04:11,982 --> 01:04:14,567
Y-YOU TOLD ME YOU
WERE GONNA MARRY ME.

1194
01:04:15,069 --> 01:04:17,321
L-LIKE AN IDIOT,
I BELIEVED YOU.

1195
01:04:18,606 --> 01:04:20,608
I MEAN,
IT WASN'T UNTIL LONG AFTER YOU MOVED AWAY

1196
01:04:20,608 --> 01:04:22,860
I FOUND OUT THAT
YOU'D BEEN USING ME ALL THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL.

1197
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,244
DARCE.
YOU KNOW,

1198
01:04:24,245 --> 01:04:26,196
YOU KNOW WHAT THE
CRAZIEST THING IS ?

1199
01:04:26,197 --> 01:04:30,034
TO THIS DAY, I MEAN,
YOU ARE STILL THE ONLY PERSON I HAVE EVER LOVED.

1200
01:04:32,002 --> 01:04:33,003
LISTEN...

1201
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:36,006
I WAS AN ASSHOLE, OK ?

1202
01:04:36,006 --> 01:04:37,791
BUT I CAN'T GO BACK
AND CHANGE THAT.

1203
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:40,294
<i>I wish I could,</i>
<i>but I can't.</i>

1204
01:04:40,961 --> 01:04:42,679
YOU HURT ME.

1205
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,014
YOU KNOW,

1206
01:04:44,014 --> 01:04:47,050
WHEN I THOUGHT
YOU BELIEVED IN ME, I BLOSSOMED.

1207
01:04:47,051 --> 01:04:51,855
AND ONE KISS FROM YOU,
I--I FELT I COULD FLY.

1208
01:04:51,856 --> 01:04:56,310
I TRIED. I MEAN, I--I ENTERED
A PERSONAL AD ONCE.

1209
01:04:56,310 --> 01:05:00,697
AND I ENDED UP GETTING
TO KNOW A REALLY NICE GUY OVER THE TELEPHONE.

1210
01:05:00,698 --> 01:05:02,700
HE CAME OVER.

1211
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:04,702
HE TOOK ONE
LOOK AT ME.

1212
01:05:04,702 --> 01:05:07,705
HE DIDN'T EVEN
TAKE OFF HIS COAT.

1213
01:05:07,705 --> 01:05:11,408
AND THE SAD PART IS
I WAS ONLY HALF THE WEIGHT I AM NOW.

1214
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:15,912
YOU KNOW, I CAN--
I CAN ALMOST UNDERSTAND WHAT HE DID.

1215
01:05:15,913 --> 01:05:17,414
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, HE
WAS JUST BEING HONEST,

1216
01:05:17,915 --> 01:05:19,416
AND I WAS THE ONE WHO
STRETCHED THE TRUTH

1217
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:21,418
WHEN I DESCRIBED
MYSELF OVER THE PHONE.

1218
01:05:22,386 --> 01:05:24,388
BUT YOU...

1219
01:05:24,388 --> 01:05:28,392
YOU HAD THE MOST
SOUGHT-AFTER PRIZE AT CASPER HIGH

1220
01:05:28,392 --> 01:05:30,894
WHO WANTED NO ONE
IN THAT SCHOOL BUT YOU.

1221
01:05:36,934 --> 01:05:37,935
I'M SORRY.

1222
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:42,272
CAN YOU FORGIVE ME ?

1223
01:05:49,747 --> 01:05:51,749
HOW ABOUT A KISS...

1224
01:05:51,749 --> 01:05:53,584
JUST FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE ?

1225
01:06:02,543 --> 01:06:03,460
( grunting )

1226
01:06:06,046 --> 01:06:07,547
( gasping )

1227
01:06:07,548 --> 01:06:09,016
FORGIVE YOU ?

1228
01:06:09,016 --> 01:06:10,300
I FUCKIN' HATE YOU.

1229
01:06:10,301 --> 01:06:12,386
WILLIE, GET HIM
OUT OF HERE !

1230
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:14,354
NOW WAIT A MINUTE--

1231
01:06:14,355 --> 01:06:16,023
NOW WAIT-- HEY,
NO. HEY, NO, NO.

1232
01:06:16,023 --> 01:06:18,725
WAIT. WAIT, 3 LITTLE WORDS.
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

1233
01:06:18,726 --> 01:06:20,227
GET HIM OUT OF HERE, NOW !

1234
01:06:24,398 --> 01:06:25,198
( groaning )

1235
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:26,450
STAY AWAY FROM MY SISTER !

1236
01:06:27,568 --> 01:06:29,036
YOU DON'T GET
IT, DO YOU ?

1237
01:06:29,036 --> 01:06:30,404
YOU RUINED
HER LIFE !

1238
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:32,238
WILLIE, I--

1239
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:33,623
HEY, BUDDY,
DO ME A FAVOR.

1240
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:35,959
QUIT STOMPING ON
PEOPLE'S HEARTS.

1241
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,796
THEY'RE NOT
ALL AS HARD AND AS EMPTY AS YOURS.

1242
01:06:38,796 --> 01:06:42,082
SO GET THE FUCK OFF
OF MY PROPERTY, BEFORE I CALL THE COPS !

1243
01:06:44,969 --> 01:06:46,253
( engine starting )

1244
01:06:47,972 --> 01:06:49,223
( tires screeching )

1245
01:06:49,223 --> 01:06:50,724
( glass shattering )

1246
01:07:35,185 --> 01:07:37,187
( Anna )
<i>I THINK YOU'RE THE</i> <i>MOST SEXIST, SHALLOW,</i>

1247
01:07:37,187 --> 01:07:40,690
<i>SELF-CENTERED MAN I'VE EVER</i>
<i>HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO MEET.</i>

1248
01:07:40,691 --> 01:07:43,694
( Darcy )
<i>FORGIVE YOU ?</i> <i>I FUCKIN' HATE YOU.</i>

1249
01:07:45,696 --> 01:07:47,698
( Doug )
<i>MY NAME IS DOUG MENFORD.</i> <i>I--I KNEW EMMA.</i>

1250
01:07:47,698 --> 01:07:49,199
( Mrs. Wickman )
<i>OH.</i>

1251
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:51,701
<i>I'M SORRY, WE'RE BUSY.</i>

1252
01:08:12,639 --> 01:08:14,140
( sighing )

1253
01:08:14,141 --> 01:08:16,143
I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE BACK.

1254
01:08:17,845 --> 01:08:21,849
EMMA TOLD ME ABOUT
YOU BEFORE SHE DIED.

1255
01:08:21,849 --> 01:08:24,852
SHE TOLD ME HOW
SHE'D FALLEN SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH YOU,

1256
01:08:25,352 --> 01:08:27,854
ADORED YOU, WOULD
DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.

1257
01:08:29,356 --> 01:08:32,359
AND THEN, UH,
WHEN SHE FOUND OUT SHE WAS PREGNANT,

1258
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:35,362
SHE TOOK ONE LONG
LOOK AT YOU.

1259
01:08:35,863 --> 01:08:37,865
AND SHE THOUGHT,
"THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF A MAN

1260
01:08:37,865 --> 01:08:40,367
THAT I WANT TO HAVE
RAISE MY CHILD."

1261
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,220
( sobbing )

1262
01:09:12,232 --> 01:09:13,233
HELLO ?

1263
01:09:16,954 --> 01:09:18,455
ARE YOU OK ?

1264
01:09:20,457 --> 01:09:22,242
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME.

1265
01:09:27,464 --> 01:09:28,465
AH...

1266
01:09:28,966 --> 01:09:31,468
WELL, IF I MIGHT
SAY SOMETHING,

1267
01:09:31,468 --> 01:09:33,837
I THINK THAT
DEEP DOWN INSIDE,

1268
01:09:33,837 --> 01:09:35,839
YOU NOW TRULY BELIEVE
THAT YOU ARE A DICK,

1269
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:39,259
AND THAT MAKES
YOU FEEL HORRIBLE ABOUT YOURSELF.

1270
01:09:39,259 --> 01:09:42,262
THAT STUFF YOU HAD
ME SAY TO CHRISTINE IS ACTUALLY TRUE.

1271
01:09:48,185 --> 01:09:49,186
( sighing )

1272
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:51,738
I KNOW THAT LITTLE
GIRL WAS MINE.

1273
01:09:51,738 --> 01:09:54,607
I WAS WITH HER MOTHER
THE WHOLE SUMMER OF '91.

1274
01:09:54,608 --> 01:09:56,610
SHE GOT PREGNANT.

1275
01:09:56,610 --> 01:10:00,113
SHE HAD OUR BABY
AND DECIDED NOT TO TELL ME ABOUT IT.

1276
01:10:01,615 --> 01:10:04,117
WHAT DOES THAT SAY ?
IT SAYS "LOSER."

1277
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:06,669
"DEADBEAT."

1278
01:10:09,673 --> 01:10:13,677
I'M GOING TO STEP
OUTSIDE MY LEGAL CAPACITY FOR A MOMENT, OK ?

1279
01:10:13,677 --> 01:10:16,179
YOUR GRANDMOTHER TRUSTED
ME TO EXECUTE HER ESTATE,

1280
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,515
SO I THINK SHE TRUSTS ME
TO MAKE A JUDGMENT CALL HERE.

1281
01:10:19,967 --> 01:10:22,970
YOU'VE HAD YOUR TEETH
KICKED IN ON THIS TRIP.

1282
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:25,472
BUT I THINK
YOU'VE LEARNED THE SORT OF LESSON

1283
01:10:25,472 --> 01:10:27,307
YOUR GRANDMOTHER
WANTED YOU TO LEARN.

1284
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:30,810
THE MILLION DOLLARS
IS YOURS.

1285
01:10:31,812 --> 01:10:32,813
REALLY ?

1286
01:10:32,813 --> 01:10:34,314
YEAH.

1287
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:37,367
YOU'VE EARNED IT.
IN FACT, I THINK YOU DESERVE IT.

1288
01:10:37,367 --> 01:10:39,869
THANK YOU.
THAT'S REALLY NICE OF YOU.

1289
01:10:40,871 --> 01:10:42,372
IT'S MY PLEASURE.

1290
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:11,984
WHAT ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND ?

1291
01:11:11,985 --> 01:11:15,488
I COULDN'T HELP
BUT NOTICE HE WAS MARKED DOWN TO $4.99

1292
01:11:15,489 --> 01:11:18,408
BACK AT THE DRUGSTORE.

1293
01:11:18,408 --> 01:11:22,028
I KEEP THAT PHOTO TO
SHIELD MYSELF FROM UNWANTED ADVANCES.

1294
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:24,364
LIKE THIS ONE ?

1295
01:11:24,364 --> 01:11:25,365
YES.

1296
01:12:44,528 --> 01:12:46,780

1297

( door clicking )

1298
01:12:55,622 --> 01:12:56,039
HI.

1299
01:12:57,124 --> 01:12:58,125
HI.

1300
01:12:58,125 --> 01:13:00,127
THOSE ARE FOR YOU.

1301
01:13:00,627 --> 01:13:02,045
THANK YOU. UM...

1302
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:04,547
TAKE A SEAT,
MR. MENFORD, PLEASE.

1303
01:13:04,548 --> 01:13:07,050
THAT'S A LITTLE
FORMAL, ISN'T IT ?

1304
01:13:08,051 --> 01:13:09,469
AHEM.

1305
01:13:13,473 --> 01:13:14,724
THERE IS NO MILLION DOLLARS.

1306
01:13:15,225 --> 01:13:16,226
WHAT ?

1307
01:13:16,226 --> 01:13:18,194
THERE'S NO INHERITANCE.
THERE NEVER WAS ONE.

1308
01:13:25,569 --> 01:13:26,820
DO YOU REMEMBER THIS ?

1309
01:13:27,821 --> 01:13:29,322
NO.

1310
01:13:29,322 --> 01:13:31,157
YOU BEFRIENDED ME FOR
AN ENTIRE SEMESTER,

1311
01:13:31,158 --> 01:13:33,076
AND MADE ME FALL
IN LOVE WITH YOU,

1312
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:36,579
JUST SO YOU COULD
GET INTO SOME DICK-FEST ORGANIZATION.

1313
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:38,081
MY FRIEND FOUND THIS

1314
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:42,135
ON THE SCORE  <i>DU JOUR</i>
<i>BULLETIN BOARD</i> <i>IN YOUR FRAT HOUSE.</i>

1315
01:13:42,135 --> 01:13:45,054
OK, THAT WAS-- THAT
WAS A LONG TIME AGO. I'VE--I'VE CHANGED.

1316
01:13:45,555 --> 01:13:48,558
IT'S WAY TOO LATE
FOR YOU TO BE SORRY.

1317
01:13:48,558 --> 01:13:51,060
I WAS A FRESHMAN.
I HAD NO FRIENDS.

1318
01:13:51,061 --> 01:13:53,179
AND YOU CAME ALONG, AND
YOU TURNED ON YOUR CHARM

1319
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:56,766
AND MADE ME FEEL
LIKE THE LUCKIEST GIRL ON CAMPUS.

1320
01:13:56,767 --> 01:14:00,821
LOOK. IT WAS A--
IT WAS A DIRTY TRICK, AND I'M TRULY, TRULY SORRY.

1321
01:14:00,821 --> 01:14:03,323
YOU RUINED MY 4
COLLEGE YEARS FOR ME,

1322
01:14:03,323 --> 01:14:05,825
AND I NEVER GOT OVER
THE HUMILIATION OF THAT.

1323
01:14:05,826 --> 01:14:08,695
I VOWED THAT ONE DAY
I WOULD FIND YOU

1324
01:14:08,695 --> 01:14:11,948
AND MAKE YOU FEEL AS BAD
AS YOU MADE ME FEEL.

1325
01:14:12,449 --> 01:14:15,585
WHAT ABOUT FRIDAY NIGHT ?
I MEAN, DOESN'T THAT MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU ?

1326
01:14:15,585 --> 01:14:17,086
OH, WELL...

1327
01:14:18,088 --> 01:14:20,090
I SHOULD THINK THAT
YOU, MORE THAN ANYONE,

1328
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:23,093
KNOWS THE MEANING
OF THE WORDS "ONE-NIGHT STAND."

1329

( sighing )

1330
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:32,768
YOU PLANNED THIS ?

1331
01:14:37,107 --> 01:14:38,608
THAT'S SAD.

1332
01:14:43,613 --> 01:14:46,115
LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING. AHEM.

1333
01:14:46,116 --> 01:14:49,702
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
FIND IT IN YOUR HEART TO FORGIVE ME ?

1334
01:14:49,703 --> 01:14:51,705
FOR WHAT YOU DID TO ME ?

1335
01:14:51,705 --> 01:14:52,706
NEVER.

1336
01:14:54,708 --> 01:14:56,710
WELL, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

1337
01:14:57,210 --> 01:14:58,711
I FORGIVE YOU.

1338
01:15:07,337 --> 01:15:08,838

1339
01:15:18,732 --> 01:15:20,984
( carousel music playing )

1340
01:15:28,575 --> 01:15:29,576
SO, DID YOU
LIKE YOUR HORSE ?

1341
01:15:30,076 --> 01:15:31,077
YEAH.

1342
01:15:31,077 --> 01:15:32,411

UH-HUH.

1343
01:15:32,412 --> 01:15:33,413
GOOD.

1344
01:15:33,413 --> 01:15:34,914
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FOR SUPPER ?

1345
01:15:34,915 --> 01:15:35,865
PIZZA.

1346
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:41,871
C-CAN YOU EXCUSE
ME FOR 2 SECS ?

1347
01:15:45,342 --> 01:15:46,343
HI.

1348
01:15:46,843 --> 01:15:47,844
HI.

1349
01:15:48,929 --> 01:15:50,931
I SEE YOU GOT HER.

1350
01:15:50,931 --> 01:15:53,717
OH, YEAH, MORE--
MORE LIKE SHE'S GOT ME, THANKS TO YOU.

1351
01:15:54,601 --> 01:15:55,602

1356
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:07,530
REALLY ? WHAT
DOES HE SAY ?

1357
01:16:07,531 --> 01:16:09,783
HE SAYS THAT
YOU'RE SMART,

1358
01:16:09,783 --> 01:16:11,067
AND SMART WOMEN
ALWAYS WIN.

1359
01:16:13,119 --> 01:16:14,620
I DIDN'T SAY
THAT THEY WIN.

1360
01:16:14,621 --> 01:16:16,990
I SAID THAT THEY USUALLY
GET WHAT THEY WANT.

1361
01:16:21,411 --> 01:16:23,413
YEAH, BUT SOMETIMES WHEN
THEY GET WHAT THEY WANT,

1362
01:16:23,413 --> 01:16:25,915
THEY REALIZE
THEY DON'T ACTUALLY WANT IT ANYMORE.

1363
01:16:29,753 --> 01:16:31,137
WE SHOULD GET GOING.

1364
01:16:31,137 --> 01:16:32,638
