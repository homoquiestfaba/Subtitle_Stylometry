00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:55,053
You don't seem too into it.
I know this is kind of a nerd shrine.

167
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,682
I should have taken these things down
a long time ago.

168
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:02,477
It's not that big of a deal. I mean, a lot
of people probably live with their parents

169
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:05,898
-and have swords.
-Well, I have to tell you...

170
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,444
-I've lived on my own since I was 13.
-Mm...

171
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,237
-I'm kind of a lone wolf. Yeah.
-Yeah.

172
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:15,616
-You were like a runaway or something?
-No, I skipped high school.

173
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,326
-Oh.
-Yeah.

174
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,578
True story. And I just got back.

175
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:23,165
OK. So this is like your room as a kid?

176
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,709
Yes. This is my 13-year-old version.

177
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:30,255
OK. And you're definitely not
into this stuff anymore, right?

178
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,673
-I hate all this stuff.
-OK.

179
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:35,844
If you want any of this stuff, you should
feel free to just walk out with it.

180
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:40,516
Yeah. How did you skip high school?

181
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,936
Well, I took a test. That was it.

182
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,854
-That's crazy.
-Yeah.

183
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:48,315
-So you're a genius?
-Yes.

184
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,319
No, I'm not a genius.
It took me eight years to graduate.

185
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,863
-But yes, I'm a genius.
-Oh.

186
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:59,159
What about you? Where are you from?
What's your favorite color?

187
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:02,287
What instruments do you play?
Do you like horses?

188
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,958
[knocking on door]

189
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:09,294
Meister, you wouldn't happen to have
anything to drink, would you?

190
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:12,297
No, I don't have anything to drink.
I have a friend here.

191
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:13,882
Oh, hello.

192
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:19,137
-This is a beautiful girl.
-I don't have anything to drink, alright?

193
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:21,974
-Come on.
-Frank, there's nothing in here.

194
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,059
A little sip. A little taste for Frankie?

195
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,811
[Cindy]
What the hell are you doing in here?

196
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:29,231
OK. I'm just--
Can we just step outside for a minute?

197
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,233
I'm sorry, I'll be right back.

198
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:34,736
[Frank] Nice to meet you.

199
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,031
[Cindy] You're bothering him
on the first fucking day, Frank!

200
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:41,034
-I didn't know he was...
-Oh, you heard them up there.

201
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:45,289
Will you guys please, please
not do this right now? Please?

202
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,333
Geej, it's all good. Just give me
the cashola, I'll go to the liquor store.

203
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,919
What?! Are you joking?!

204
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:53,589
I just want a little something.
A little sip.

205
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:57,050
Quit being a goddamn little kid.
"I want more alcohol."

206
00:11:57,134 --> 00:12:00,429
You've got a job interview tomorrow.
Get your ass to bed!

207
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,891
Do you care about your family? Do you?

208
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:06,560
Because if you did,
you'd be responsible and say,

209
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,938
"Honey, don't worry, honey.
Just go to bed."

210
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:12,983
"I'm going to bed. Let's all go to bed.
Let's have a good night."

211
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:17,196
But no, you want more alcohol
to make me worry all night.

212
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,281
You're gonna get up in the morning?

213
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,492
I'm sick of worrying because
you won't fucking do the right thing!

214
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,786
-I just want a little twist.
-A twist?!

215
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:31,376
Just let him do whatever he wants.
Screaming is not gonna help anything.

216
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,382
Look at that face.

217
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:42,638
Very good-looking boy.
No question about it.

218
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:09,957
[indistinct arguing]

219
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,292
-[Frank] I'm getting up!
-[Cindy] Then get up!

220
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:15,379
[Cindy] You're not getting up!
I don't see you getting up!

221
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,089
[Frank] If you leave me the fuck alone
maybe I'll get up.

222
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,174
[Cindy] I leave you the fuck alone,
you won't get up.

223
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:22,219
[clock] <i>It's 7:17am.</i>

224
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,097
Don't worry, this is normal.

225
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,307
[arguing continues]

226
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:30,811
[Cindy] He was so drunk
he could not stand up.

227
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:33,355
And he's saying to me,
"You're the captain of the ship."

228
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,692
I said, "If I ran the show
you wouldn't be doing this!"

229
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:39,152
"Bullshit. Is this what I rule?"

230
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:42,781
Oh! Pull over right here. Right--
No, no, no, no, no. Right there.

231
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:00,841
OK. That guy saw me go get it.

232
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:02,843
You're gonna get caught someday,
you know that?

233
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:07,389
Yeah. Anyway, listen,
I got it all worked out.

234
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:11,852
Since I have such a good resumé I'm
planning to get a job in show business.

235
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:13,312
As soon as I get my teeth fixed.

236
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:15,898
Then I'm gonna marry a Jewish producer.

237
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:19,902
You know, hook you up in
the film industry and leave Frank.

238
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:23,572
So you're gonna leave Frank
after you marry the producer or before?

239
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:26,450
Before or after, it doesn't matter.

240
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,827
Actually, I'm gonna get a job
at Art Center.

241
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:32,831
-At Art Center?
-Yes. Here's the kicker.

242
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:36,543
I found out that if I work there,
then you get free tuition.

243
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,962
-Really?
-Yes!

244
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:41,465
Isn't that great?

245
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:47,804
Yeah. I mean, I already have most of the
money, but that's a really nice gesture.

246
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:50,974
Well, now you're not gonna need your
evil grandmother's money anymore

247
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:53,018
because you're gonna go for free.

248
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:56,355
GJ, now that I'm sober,
I'm just hell bent on doing something

249
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:59,191
to help you for a change. You'll see.

250
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:03,820
Well, I have to say
I'm really happy that you quit drinking.

251
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:06,615
But I don't know how you're
gonna stay sober living with Frank.

252
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:12,287
Yeah, but honey, you don't understand.
I don't love Frank anymore.

253
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:14,039
He's history.

254
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,668
Yeah, I don't know how you
loved him in the first place.

255
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,091
[phones ringing]

256
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:27,719
[whispers] She's my boss.
She has the biggest ass I've ever seen.

257
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:32,766
Oh, my God.
Look, look, look, look, look, top trunk.

258
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,810
Hi, Rhonda.

259
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:39,106
This is the most boring job
I've ever had. Ever.

260
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,733
[phone rings]

261
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:44,152

Gilbert's been calling 24/7, huh?

274
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:23,066
-Yeah.
-Does it bum you out, Geej?

275
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:28,488
You know, he's not really your father.

276
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:32,534
You know that, right? Not according
to your mother and me anyway.

277
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:36,747
Well, you know, I can put up with you,
I can put up with him.

278
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,790
-Wanna have a man-to-man talk?
-No.

279
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:41,710
-Let's have a man-to-man talk.
-No, that's OK.

280
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,966
You got a lot of chicks
coming in and out of this house.

281
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,136
I had no idea you were such a stud, man.

282
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,514
Let's talk about chicks.
Want to talk about some chicks?

283
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,599
No. [chuckles]

284
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:59,436
-God, no.
-Let's make a movie.

285
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,397
You should make
a frickin' movie every day.

286
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:06,151
Art is like a muscle. Use or lose it.

287
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,570
What do you think I should film?

288
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:14,368
My equipment.
Let's videotape my new equipment.

289
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,828
I've been dying to show it to you.
Come on.

290
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:20,541
-I would like to see your new equipment.
-Yeah, come on.

291
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,878
Geej, the 24-track mixer.

292
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:26,630
-Top of the line.
-That's new.

293
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:29,758
New projector, new video system. Hey!

294
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:32,803
We should load up one of your movies.
Have a screening.

295
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:36,098
-That's another project.
-Yeah.

296
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:38,892
So how did you pay for all this stuff.
Did you steal it or...?

297
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:43,021
[scoffs] It was cheap. Know some people
who knew some people...

298
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:45,816
-[door opening]
-Hands were "made," deals were "shaken."

299
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:47,568
Yeah.

300
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,946
-What are you doing in here?
-Showing Geej the studio.

301
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,615
GJ doesn't care about your studio, Frank.

302
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,492
How did you pay for all this?

303
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:57,786
I got a settlement.

304
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,540
You got a settlement
and you didn't tell me?

305
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:06,962
Think of it as an investment.

306
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:12,634
OK, GJ. You have to promise
not to get stressed.

307
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:15,971
-What are you guys talking about?
-It was a year and a half ago.

308
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,974
And I was drinking and...

309
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:21,643
-my judgment was foggy and Frank...
-No, wait.

310
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:23,770
You couldn't have spent my savings.

311
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:26,315
No! I just haven't repaid it.

312
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:29,818
I was gonna get this loan
and then the car broke down.

313
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:32,070
What? What? No, no, OK.

314
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,199
How did you even get access to my account?

315
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:36,658
She did it.

316
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:40,454
GJ, it doesn't even matter
because I'm gonna get this job.

317
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:43,373
You were forwarding me bank statements
while I was in New York.

318
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,709
-What are you talking about?
-I, for one,

319
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,711
am very relieved
the cat is out of the bag.

320
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,506
You shut up! We had a plan, Frank.

321
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:54,510
You know how goddamn important this was.
No, he's not gonna--

322
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:56,678
Just shut up!

323
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:07,439
I'm leaving this house.
I'm leaving right now

324
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:12,277
and I'm never going to speak
to either of you ever again.

325
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,282

Um, OK, so why aren't you
wildly successful as a musician?

372

Because of my frustration
with the music business.

00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:05,264
[chokes] Excuse me?

491
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:08,308
-Why is that funny?
-No, I'm not gonna make out with you.

492
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:11,895
First of all, no way you could beat me.
Obviously.

493
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:15,190
And second of all, if somehow you did...

494
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:17,401
I still wouldn't make out with you.

495
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:20,404
OK. OK. Final offer.
Above the waist touching only.

496
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:28,829
I just actually got out of
a really long and shitty relationship.

497
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:31,582
And I have to lay low.

498
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:36,920
I didn't mean to lead you on or anything.

499
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:40,632
No, no, no. That's alright.
I understand. I can respect that.

500
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,218
-Men are pigs.
-Yeah.

501
00:30:43,302 --> 00:30:44,720
-I'm a pig.
-Yeah.

502
00:30:44,803 --> 00:30:46,555
-That's a good call.
-OK.

503
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:48,640
Besides, I got tons of other girls
anyways, so...

504
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:51,768
Oh, yeah, right. Like what, dork chasers?

505
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:56,857
Oh, ye of little faith.

506
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,903
[indie music plays]

507
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,365
[laughs]

508
00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:11,788
Um... I can't tell if this is amazing
or, like, really terrible.

509
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,498
What's wrong with you?
You show these to everyone?

510
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:16,251
You said that you only want to be friends
so I thought, fuck it.

511
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:19,630
This would cement our friendship.
And I knew after this,

512
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:21,715
you would never want to sleep with me.

513
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:27,596
[GJ] That guy in the middle
is taking it like a champ.

514
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,723
I love the gay porn.

515
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:33,602
Never have told that to a dude before.

516
00:31:34,353 --> 00:31:40,901
I think that the entire concept of love...
is a sham. I don't believe in it.

517
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:43,862
-Oh. Me neither.
-Really?

518
00:31:43,946 --> 00:31:45,781
-Yeah!
-I swear to God

519
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:47,866
you're the first girl
that's ever agreed with me.

520
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,410
Uh, I used to be really fat.

521
00:31:51,703 --> 00:31:55,958
And... I hate small dicks.

522
00:31:56,041 --> 00:32:00,003
My ex-boyfriend, his was like a dog penis.

523
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:03,298
Like, I think I know what you're talking
about, like pointy and curvy.

524
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:04,591
-Like a Smurfette.
-Yeah.

525
00:32:04,675 --> 00:32:06,635
That's disgusting.

526
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:09,221
Yeah, man. That was rough.

527
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:13,433
Alright. We gotta keep going. Um, uh...

528
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:16,562
OK. In the nature of being honest...

529
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:21,817
What if I told you
that I've cheated a lot?

530
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,572
I don't know. Have you?

531
00:32:26,655 --> 00:32:28,532
Have you?

532
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:31,243
[distant arguing / door closing]

533
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,456
-Well, it's officially morning.
-Yeah, I should go.

534
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,999
You aren't all of a sudden
freaked out, are you?

535
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:42,129
No, I'm not freaked out. I have
band practice in, like, a couple hours.

536
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:44,089
-Oh, how hip.
-Fuck you.

537
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:46,175
[he laughs]

538
00:32:46,258 --> 00:32:47,551
-OK.
-I really should get out of here.

539
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:51,305
Well, let's do an awkward ass
out hug and...

540
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:52,806
I'll walk you downstairs.

541
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,058
I don't know what an "awkward ass hug" is.

542
00:32:55,142 --> 00:32:56,768
-You don't?
-No.

543
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:59,563
Just stick your butt out.
We're like 7th grade dancing.

544
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:05,402
There we go.
You didn't stick your ass out.

545
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:09,865
Oh, I should film. It's a long story.

546
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:19,958
[beep]

547
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:23,378
[Gilbert] <i>You know, I'm sitting</i>
<i>out here watching my cat,</i>

548
00:33:23,462 --> 00:33:27,549
<i>and it's sad, because she's all I've got.</i>

549
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:30,677
<i>And you know</i>
<i>she's not gonna be here forever.</i>

550
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:35,557
<i>I feel like I'm sitting here</i>
<i>watching her die.</i>

551
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:39,728
<i>And I look at her and she says to me...</i>

552
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:44,525
<i>"No, Gilbert, I'm watching you die."</i>

553
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:48,445
<i>Would you please call me back</i>
<i>sometime? Please?</i>

554
00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:10,843
-Hi, honey.
-Hi.

555
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:14,805
I'm just getting this one--
Oh, no! Come on. I look ugly today.

556
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:17,391
How is everything going with
your master plan?

557
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:20,018
Well, I'm glad you asked.

558
00:34:20,102 --> 00:34:24,773
I have an appointment in a few weeks
to get my teeth fixed.

559
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:27,943
I still don't understand
what applying for jobs

560
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:29,695
has to do with going to the dentist.

561
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:33,031
GJ, you may not know this,
but I'm missing 17 teeth.

562
00:34:33,115 --> 00:34:34,658
-Show me.
-No!

563
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:36,326
-Come on.
-No!

564
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,662
Come on, we're documenting
all this, remember?

565
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:41,290
Put your money where your mouth is.

566
00:34:44,126 --> 00:34:46,253
OK. Now...

567
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:52,009
-Something weird happened.
-What?

568
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:55,220
Remember I said I wasn't
going to put any of this footage online?

569
00:34:55,304 --> 00:34:57,306
-Yeah?
-Well, I lied.

570
00:34:57,389 --> 00:35:01,101
I made a five-minute short
and I put it on a video website.

571
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:03,061
Oh.

572
00:35:03,145 --> 00:35:05,522
And a bunch of people saw it.

573
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:08,650
I think that this might be something.

574
00:35:08,734 --> 00:35:12,571
I think I could make, like, an
actual documentary out of this thing.

575
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:19,036
I think I'm gonna ramp up filming.
I'm gonna really dig deep.

576
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,663
We're gonna pull out
all the skeletons in the closet.

577
00:35:21,747 --> 00:35:23,957
Everything is gonna be seen
on this camera.

578
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:26,126
I may not be going to Art Center
thanks to you guys,

579
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:30,756
but at least we can make a documentary
about our messed-up lives.

580
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:33,592
Can I just put on some make-up?

581
00:35:33,675 --> 00:35:36,720
-Can you get Frank on board?
-Yes, he'll do it.

582
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:38,347
He'll do it or he's a dead man.

583
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:41,183
[Frank strums guitar]

584
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:43,560
-[GJ] Let me take this off.
-[Cindy chuckles]

585
00:35:47,231 --> 00:35:48,232
Oh, yeah.

586
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:51,026
[Cindy laughs]

587
00:35:52,903 --> 00:35:55,739
-OK, I'm ready.
-[Cindy] OK. OK.

588
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,243
You want me to hold this flag?

589
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:00,786
-[GJ] I think not.
-No?

590
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:04,081
So, Frank, we're gonna
talk about some stuff.

591
00:36:04,164 --> 00:36:07,751
GJ says that we're going for broke now
and I'm all for it.

592
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:11,713
So, this is gonna be good,
cos I've got some questions for you.

593
00:36:11,797 --> 00:36:16,426
So tell us about your music.
Tell me about that new song.

594
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,220
You know, the one
you were telling me about.

595
00:36:18,303 --> 00:36:20,347
I want to produce a band.

596
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:25,185
I think the world is in dire straits
for a new Beatle band.

597
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:29,106
And I would like to produce a group
that would sound like The Beatles.

598
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:31,859
You know, singing those sweet songs.

599
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:35,487
Those songs that portray the love
and the humanity.

600
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:39,157
I mean, not much to life...

601
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:41,952
except sex and food and...

602
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:45,873
...water.

603
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:50,043
So, do you want your stuff to play live?

604
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:53,922
No. I'm through performing and that.
Never gonna perform again.

605
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:59,178
[laughs] Can you imagine him
rocking out on stage?

606
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:01,180
What? I look good.

607
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:04,308
What happened to all that OXO money?

608
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:10,480
-I blew it.
-Like on what?

609
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:14,193
-Food, gas... dry cleaning.
-Cocaine.

610
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:17,946
You see, she puts this on record
and makes me look like a fucking criminal.

611
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,990
I'm doing all sorts of things, you know.

612
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:22,284
Do we have a picture of that girl in DATA?

613
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:25,245
She was the one that
you had your first affair with.

614
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:27,289
-[Cindy] What was the reason for that?
-[Frank] Honey...

615
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:33,086
People do what they do.
You know? It's... about the moment.

616
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:35,964
Can you predict the future? I don't know
what's gonna happen tomorrow.

617
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:37,925
-Do you know what's gonna happen tomorrow?
-Living for the moment.

618
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:41,845
That's selfish. You'd be having affairs
right now but you're too fat.

619
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:45,015
That's the truth.
You wouldn't even be nice to me

620
00:37:45,098 --> 00:37:46,808
if women were interested in you.

621
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:49,311
I could. I could have an affair
at the drop of a hat.

622
00:37:49,394 --> 00:37:51,063
With what?!

623
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:55,400
A lot of fat women out there
who love fat men.

624
00:37:55,484 --> 00:37:57,528
But why are we talking about
that stupid time?

625
00:37:57,611 --> 00:38:00,405
Let's talk about something else.
Let's play a song.

626
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:02,574
-You guys are solid gold.
-But the thing is...

627
00:38:02,658 --> 00:38:04,201
-What?
-Huh?

628
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:05,744
You guys are solid gold.

629
00:38:07,162 --> 00:38:09,540
[both] What's that supposed to mean?

00:38:09,623 --> 00:38:11,917

You wanna get the fuck out of here?

-Yeah? Let's go.

-Yeah, let's go.

Hey, sorry we had to get out of there.
It's like...

647
00:38:58,172 --> 00:39:00,966
It's my ex-boyfriend.
He's been calling me all the time

648
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:05,304
and then showing up to all of our shows.
It's driving me fucking crazy.

649
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:07,681
Has he been waving that little penis
around?

650
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:09,975
-No. Stop.
-You're not the only one with a stalker.

651
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:12,603
-I actually have a stalker, too.
-Oh, tell me.

652
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:14,438
He's my dad.

653
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:16,398
-Like your real dad?
-Yeah.

654
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:20,444
He's a crazy conspiracy theorist. Right?
He lives in this trailer

655
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:24,156
and he's had sex, allegedly,
with, like, 600 women.

656
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:26,325
And he's chronicled all in this book.
He's got entries like...

657
00:39:26,408 --> 00:39:28,785
"Alyssa. Blonde. Screamer."

658
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:31,288
-Oh, my God, you sound just like him.
-Yeah...

659
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:36,293
-Or he sounds just like you. I don't know.
-No. He's insane. Definitely.

660
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:37,711
I hope I don't sound like him.

661
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:40,589
-Fuck!
-Oh!

00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:44,468

<i>We're off to Party Island ♪</i>

663
00:39:46,512 --> 00:39:49,556
-So what have you been up to recently?
-Other than Party Island?

664
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:54,228
-Boning lots of girls, I bet.
-Tons. Yeah. Why? What do you care?

665
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:57,564
What do I care?
I'm just making conversation, bro.

666
00:39:57,648 --> 00:40:03,195
I haven't been screwing anybody because
I've been too busy filming my parents.

667
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:07,449
[chuckles] Are you doing that thing like,
"I just got out of film school

668
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:10,410
"and I, like, grabbed my camera
and I film my ma and pa

669
00:40:10,494 --> 00:40:14,289
"and interview them about their tough life
and I put myself as the lead of the movie

670
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:18,335
"and then I'm gonna cut it together
and send it to film festivals."

671
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:22,005
-Is that what everybody does?
-Yeah. Yeah.

672
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:26,218
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, so you really are doing that?

673
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:29,513
-So you're quitting drinking?
-Yeah.

674
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:31,682
Something's happening.
I'm going through a change.

675
00:40:31,765 --> 00:40:37,271
-Kind of like a menopause?
-Yeah, maybe. I don't know.

676
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:41,066
No particular trigger I can put my finger
on and say, "This is what did it."

677
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:44,903
It has nothing to do with your family
or getting a job or anything?

678
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:47,155
-I don't want to prompt you, mind you.
-No, no, no, no.

679
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:49,157
I've been concerned with my family
and a job for a long time.

680
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:51,910
It's just that it doesn't
really do anything for me,

681
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:56,790
except make me stupid and then
I regret it, and I'm tired of regretting.

682
00:40:56,874 --> 00:41:01,420
-You should have seen him last night.
-Yeah, well. GJ...

683
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:04,882
I am getting uncomfortable
with this camera thing.

684
00:41:04,965 --> 00:41:07,634
I really want to help you with
your project in any way I can,

685
00:41:07,718 --> 00:41:11,054
but I'm saying this, right now,
is an imposition for me.

686
00:41:11,138 --> 00:41:13,682
-Oh, he's above this.
-I wasn't saying I'm above it.

687
00:41:13,765 --> 00:41:15,475
Well, what do you got to hide?

688
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:17,769
You see, well, I'm growing up
and you're not.

689
00:41:17,853 --> 00:41:20,606
What? But-but-but what?

690
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:25,194
You're growing up because
you stopped drinking for six hours.

691
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:28,655
I have a job interview
and I have to get dressed. Going on.

692
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:33,327
He's quit drinking.

693
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,454
It won't last.

694
00:41:38,123 --> 00:41:40,125
Turn left at the stop sign.

695
00:41:40,209 --> 00:41:43,420
Wait a minute. Where are we going?

696
00:41:43,504 --> 00:41:47,633
Oh, I just wanted to go to
some places that we lived.

697
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:49,259
[knocking on door]

698
00:41:53,222 --> 00:41:58,060
Oh, hello. He is documenting
what a terrible mom I was.

699
00:41:58,143 --> 00:42:00,562
Can we have a look around?

700
00:42:02,564 --> 00:42:05,359
So we lived here
when you were five years old.

701
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:09,029
This is where we lived when your
grandmother came and took you away

702
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:12,366
-and then never brought you back.
-Why did she take me away?

703
00:42:13,492 --> 00:42:18,247
She said she was gonna sue me for custody.
I was a bad mom.

704
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:23,794
-Why did she think you were a bad mom?
-My sister told her things. Total lies.

705
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:26,505
-Like what?
-Oh, just, you know,

706
00:42:26,588 --> 00:42:30,759
that I was... that I was running around
with-with-with musicians.

707
00:42:30,843 --> 00:42:33,595
And that's around the time
you married Frank, right?

708
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,931
Yes.

709
00:42:36,515 --> 00:42:39,226
Shouldn't this walk down memory lane
be pleasant?

710
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:41,895
You sure I didn't die and go to hell?

711
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:47,192
I'm not joking. This is what I thought
hell would be. Going back over my life.

712
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:50,571
Well, this is the picture that's always
broken my heart right here.

713
00:42:50,654 --> 00:42:52,447
Look at your face.

714
00:42:52,531 --> 00:42:55,409
Happy Birthday, GJ, and I wasn't there.

715
00:43:00,372 --> 00:43:03,125
"Roses are red, violets are purple"?

716
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:05,919
"Get well soon. Come back to us soon."

717
00:43:06,003 --> 00:43:08,672
"Room 17." Where were you?

718
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:10,382
You don't remember?

719
00:43:13,677 --> 00:43:16,138
Was this the accident?

720
00:43:18,557 --> 00:43:21,894
What a horrific experience.
I was holding your head together.

721
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:25,147
Oh, my God, GJ. That was my fault.

722
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:26,732
What happened?

723
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:33,655
I was going through a yellow light
and a couple drunk teenagers hit us.

724
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:35,532
Were you drunk?

725
00:43:35,616 --> 00:43:39,369
I wouldn't have been drinking or
the police would have thrown me in jail.

726
00:43:39,453 --> 00:43:41,330
So then how was it your fault?

727
00:43:42,915 --> 00:43:48,045
It was my fault...
because there's more to the story.

728
00:43:51,924 --> 00:43:54,259
I was taking sedatives.

729
00:43:54,343 --> 00:43:56,678
But that had nothing to do
with the accident.

730
00:43:56,762 --> 00:44:00,432
It... It's just that I always wondered
if maybe I could have,

731
00:44:00,516 --> 00:44:04,520
you know, stopped sooner.
Better reflexes or...

732
00:44:05,771 --> 00:44:08,774
I couldn't sleep at night, you know?

733
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:14,446
I mean, I had... I had nowhere to go,
and living here and there,

734
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:17,658
a different place every week,
trying to get you back.

735
00:44:22,246 --> 00:44:26,041
You don't know how depressed
I feel about this whole thing.

736
00:44:26,124 --> 00:44:29,253
Quitting drinking
and then waking up to reality.

737
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:31,964
You find yourself, your kid has grown.

738
00:44:34,174 --> 00:44:38,136
And you can't be a mom anymore, and
that's all you want in the whole world.

739
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:41,932
Just go back and do it over.

740
00:44:43,392 --> 00:44:48,063
I'm sorry, GJ.
You don't know what that's like.

741
00:44:48,146 --> 00:44:51,900
I hope you never have
those kind of regrets ever.

742
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:55,445
I'll regret it till the day I die.
I know that.

743
00:44:55,529 --> 00:44:57,948
Of course I will.

744
00:44:58,031 --> 00:45:02,703
-But it worked out, OK? Didn't it?
-[laughs / sobs]

745
00:45:02,786 --> 00:45:04,288
Did it?

746
00:45:10,544 --> 00:45:12,379
So how was it?

747
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:16,800
I'm not cut out for this shit, you know?
I'm an artist.

748
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:19,469
I shouldn't have to work.
That's all there is to it.

749
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:21,847
-What'd you guys talk about?
-Music.

750
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:25,893
Nice guy. Perfectly nice guy.
But I don't know.

751
00:45:25,976 --> 00:45:30,606
Listen, I had this idea
I want to run by you.

752
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:35,444
I'm not gonna drink, OK?
Without your permission.

753
00:45:35,527 --> 00:45:39,072
So, I was just thinking, just for today.

754
00:45:39,156 --> 00:45:41,241
You know, for the interviews,
take the edge off.

755
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:43,869
Just maybe one little teensy twist.

756
00:45:43,952 --> 00:45:46,747
For today. Just, you know...

757
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:49,458
I'm not gonna give you
permission to drink.

758
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:51,251
I guess I won't get a job.

759

go ahead and do it. You know?

I gotta tell you, man. Sometimes I think
that you are playing a game

where you pretend to be transparent,
but actually,

that stuff you showed us? Those scenes?

Well, today... I remembered something
while we were filming.

813
00:48:58,355 --> 00:49:01,608
After my grandma took me...

814
00:49:01,692 --> 00:49:05,904
she told me that my mom
didn't want me anymore

815
00:49:05,988 --> 00:49:07,906
and that I was never gonna see her again.

816
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:12,286
I was five years old and I just remember
crying myself to sleep every single night.

817
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:15,914
And just hoping that my mom
was searching the world for me

818
00:49:15,998 --> 00:49:22,296
and she was gonna swoop in like Superman
and just save me and take me away.

819
00:49:23,046 --> 00:49:28,635
And I saw this photograph my grandma
showed me of Frank and Cindy's wedding

820
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:32,097
and I thought, that's it, you know?

821
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:34,683
I'm forgotten. You know?

822
00:49:35,934 --> 00:49:38,854
-I had a pretty fucked-up life.
-You know what, GJ?

823
00:49:38,937 --> 00:49:43,317
Everybody had it fucked up.
Everybody goes through horrible shit.

824
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,738
I went through terrible shit as a kid.
Life is tough.

825
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:52,367
You suck it up and you move on.

826
00:49:53,243 --> 00:49:59,833
I think, for the record, if you've been
through something traumatizing...

827
00:49:59,917 --> 00:50:03,337
you don't have to pretend
like it never happened.

828
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,589
I'm not saying that at all.

829
00:50:05,672 --> 00:50:08,717
I'm saying that you can't use it
as an excuse to do bad shit.

830
00:50:12,137 --> 00:50:14,056
-OK. Yeah.
-It's late. It's late. It's late.

831
00:50:14,139 --> 00:50:16,892
I don't know what I'm talking about
anymore. I've had too much of this.

832
00:50:16,975 --> 00:50:22,022
If you ever want to talk about
any of this stuff or whatever...

833
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:25,067
I know where you're coming from.

834
00:50:26,151 --> 00:50:29,279
And I just think you're just
a bad ass and I love it.

835
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:34,451
-So, I'm gonna go now, but I--
-Wait, maybe you shouldn't go now.

836
00:50:37,329 --> 00:50:40,999
I think maybe we should just
get this over with.

837
00:50:45,796 --> 00:50:48,131
Don't. Don't.

838
00:50:48,215 --> 00:50:51,718
[Sixties pop music]

839
00:51:09,152 --> 00:51:11,154
Oh, brother.

840
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:21,874
Well, before they could start
the construction in my mouth,

841
00:51:21,957 --> 00:51:26,170
I had to have one tooth extracted
and I had to have an oral surgeon do it.

842
00:51:26,253 --> 00:51:31,091
So it was time to go and he said,
"You're gonna have to walk."

843
00:51:31,175 --> 00:51:33,343
I said, "I can't walk."

844
00:51:33,427 --> 00:51:36,096
And then I saw that he had,
like, four bottles of wine.

845
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,431
What time was it?

846
00:51:39,016 --> 00:51:42,311
9:00 this morning.
And I'm not disappointed.

847
00:51:42,394 --> 00:51:45,981
I'm not really disappointed
because he's drinking again,

848
00:51:46,064 --> 00:51:48,734
because I didn't have much hope. Did you?

849
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:52,321
It's just that I couldn't get
to my appointment

850
00:51:52,404 --> 00:51:55,073
and I'm just sort of let down.

851
00:51:57,117 --> 00:52:00,787
Alright, so what happened this morning?
I thought she had surgery.

852
00:52:00,871 --> 00:52:05,042
She had surgery. I took her there,
she changed her mind last minute.

853
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:09,254
Ran barefoot. You know, it's embarrassing.
Everyone's looking.

854
00:52:09,338 --> 00:52:12,090
She looks like a whacko
from an institution.

855
00:52:12,174 --> 00:52:14,510
OK, I'm confused about the timeline here.

856
00:52:14,593 --> 00:52:18,722
OK, so you decided that you
weren't gonna go this morning, right?

857
00:52:18,805 --> 00:52:22,351
Well, I was, but then I knew
he was gonna get drunk

858
00:52:22,434 --> 00:52:24,186
and I knew he couldn't pick me up drunk.

859
00:52:24,269 --> 00:52:26,813
So when you decided
that you weren't gonna go,

860
00:52:26,897 --> 00:52:31,652
-you just assumed he was gonna drink?
-No. I... He was getting...

861
00:52:31,735 --> 00:52:34,780
When I really decided not to go,
he had already bought the alcohol.

862
00:52:34,863 --> 00:52:37,574
-You're busted.
-No, I'm not!

863
00:52:37,658 --> 00:52:39,368
I don't understand what's funny.

864
00:52:39,451 --> 00:52:43,830
Well, it's not exactly like I told you.

865
00:52:43,914 --> 00:52:47,793
-It's not how you told me at all.
-Well, it was close enough.

866
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:50,212
OK, so the alcohol had been
purchased at this point?

867
00:52:50,295 --> 00:52:51,421
-Yes.
-OK.

868
00:52:51,505 --> 00:52:53,340
So why did you purchase the alcohol?

869
00:52:53,423 --> 00:52:56,552
Because she was driving me crazy
all morning

870
00:52:56,635 --> 00:52:59,596
and I need something to calm me down
before I knock her block off.

871
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:00,639
I think that's well put.

872
00:53:00,722 --> 00:53:03,725
But didn't you just make
a large commitment to not drinking?

873
00:53:03,809 --> 00:53:09,481
Yes, I did. I made a commitment
and I'm sticking to that commitment.

874
00:53:09,565 --> 00:53:12,067
I just fell down for a minute.

875
00:53:14,027 --> 00:53:16,446
Frank, you have a very
important job interview today.

876
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:19,741
I know, honey.
Hey, Geej, you know that part

877
00:53:19,825 --> 00:53:22,953
where you filmed me scratching my balls,
can you cut that out?

878
00:53:23,036 --> 00:53:25,122
I don't know what you're talking about.

879
00:53:25,205 --> 00:53:28,876
It's the ball scratching part.
It's impolite, you know.

880
00:53:31,336 --> 00:53:36,383
Honey, don't look at me
with those... teeth.

881
00:53:41,638 --> 00:53:44,641
-Can I ask you something?
-Yes.

882
00:53:44,725 --> 00:53:46,643
What's changed around here?

883
00:53:46,727 --> 00:53:49,104
Well, you can't blame me
because he's drinking again.

884
00:53:49,188 --> 00:53:51,523
I could have taken you
to that appointment, though.

885
00:53:51,607 --> 00:53:54,234
-I didn't want to bug you, GJ.
-That's never stopped you before.

886
00:53:56,236 --> 00:53:59,072
I don't understand what's going on
with all this dentist stuff.

887
00:53:59,156 --> 00:54:01,909
GJ, it's just not a good time right now.

888
00:54:01,992 --> 00:54:04,411
I didn't want to tell you this,
but I've been written up at work.

889
00:54:04,494 --> 00:54:08,624
-And I can't be conked out from surgery.
-Well, then forget this job.

890
00:54:08,707 --> 00:54:12,669
I still don't understand why you can't
just go apply for new jobs.

891
00:54:12,753 --> 00:54:14,004
Why don't you apply at Art Center?

892
00:54:14,087 --> 00:54:19,510
Because I can't smile! I need confidence.
Does anybody understand that?

893
00:54:19,593 --> 00:54:22,346
You need confidence to go to
a goddamn job interview.

894
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:25,057
Do you know there's like 5,000 people
for every job?

895
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:31,063
-In show business, you gotta have an edge.
-So nothing's changed, right?

896
00:54:31,146 --> 00:54:33,649
Isn't that what I said was gonna happen?

897
00:54:34,858 --> 00:54:36,610
What's changed...

898
00:54:44,785 --> 00:54:46,912
I quit taking sedatives.

899
00:54:49,665 --> 00:54:52,709
I've been taking sedatives
the whole time you've been filming.

900
00:54:52,793 --> 00:54:56,505
Until last week,
so I'm probably different now.

901
00:54:56,588 --> 00:55:00,008
-Have you been drinking, too?
-No, of course not.

902
00:55:00,092 --> 00:55:02,803
After-- You're taking sedatives
after you told me

903
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:06,056
that you were taking sedatives whenever we
had the accident? What the hell?

904
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:08,642
I don't know how I thought that anything
could ever be different with you.

905
00:55:08,725 --> 00:55:11,228
-But it is, GJ!
-No, but nothing is different.

906
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:13,063
-Nothing's changed.
-Listen, but it has!

907
00:55:13,146 --> 00:55:15,941
-No, it hasn't!
-And you're not being fair with me, GJ!

908
00:55:16,024 --> 00:55:19,486
I don't want to hear your--
I've heard all this crap for years now.

909
00:55:22,322 --> 00:55:27,327
Well, apparently this entire time
Cindy has been taking pills.

910
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:30,414
OK, so?

911
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:33,250
So, that's a really big deal to me.

912
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:36,795
Really, I mean, what did you expect?

913
00:55:36,879 --> 00:55:41,717
What did I expect? What do you mean?
I expected her not to take pills.

914
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:47,306
You're the one who's always saying that
people just do the same shit forever.

915
00:55:47,389 --> 00:55:50,934
Bullshit! She stopped drinking.
Of course people change.

916
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:53,437
-Probably not, though.
-Yes, she did. What the fuck?

917
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,315
I don't understand. Is it really so bad to
have a little hope every once in a while

918
00:55:56,398 --> 00:55:57,900
or should I just write everybody off?

919
00:55:57,983 --> 00:56:01,195
<i>That sounds like a great idea.</i>
<i>What a great way to live.</i>

920
00:56:01,278 --> 00:56:03,197
Why are you freaking out?

921
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,742
Because I'm calling you about...
OK. I've changed.

922
00:56:06,825 --> 00:56:10,370
-OK.
-I'm not doing the stuff that I used to.

923
00:56:10,454 --> 00:56:11,955
I'm sure.

924
00:56:13,415 --> 00:56:17,294
OK. Yeah. I'm not.
I'm not seeing other girls.

925
00:56:17,377 --> 00:56:19,922
I'm not doing any of that stuff.
I don't get it.

926
00:56:20,005 --> 00:56:23,342
Why would you be doing this with me
if you think that I'm messing around?

927
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:26,178
I don't know. I don't know.

928
00:56:26,261 --> 00:56:29,056
Because I haven't thought it through.

929
00:56:29,139 --> 00:56:32,226
Because I don't-- Maybe I'm fucking up.

930
00:56:34,811 --> 00:56:37,814
OK, so you're fucking up.

931
00:56:37,898 --> 00:56:42,611
I like you, GJ, but I'll never trust you.
I'm not a moron.

932
00:56:42,694 --> 00:56:46,240
What do you mean you're not a moron?
Because I've been so honest with you?

933
00:56:46,323 --> 00:56:48,617
You know what, hey, you know what?
Do whatever you want.

934
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,661
Don't do anything you're gonna regret,
alright?

935
00:56:50,744 --> 00:56:53,705
I suck. Everybody sucks. The end.

936
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:01,755
[pounding on door]

937
00:57:04,424 --> 00:57:06,468
Open the door!

938
00:57:09,054 --> 00:57:11,390
-[girl] I can't do this.
-[Cindy] Oh!

939
00:57:11,473 --> 00:57:12,850
Go, go, go, go. Go.

940
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:20,399
[Cindy] Frank!

941
00:57:28,073 --> 00:57:30,158
Hey. What's up?

942
00:57:30,242 --> 00:57:34,496
Um, Kate, this is Melissa,
a friend of mine. Melissa, this is Kate.

943
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:35,998
Nice to meet you, Kate.

944
00:57:36,081 --> 00:57:39,084
-Well, I should be going to work.
-Right. Yeah.

945
00:57:39,168 --> 00:57:40,669
-Alright, bye.
-OK.

946
00:57:40,752 --> 00:57:42,921
-I'll see you soon?
-Alright.

947
00:57:47,509 --> 00:57:49,469
So, were you just in the neighborhood?

948
00:57:49,553 --> 00:57:54,600
No, actually, I felt bad
about what I said and...

949
00:57:55,601 --> 00:57:57,144
...I was gonna give you that CD.

950
00:57:57,895 --> 00:58:01,982
-Kate, she's just a friend of mine.
-I told you I'm not stupid, GJ.

951
00:58:02,065 --> 00:58:06,653
-Actually, I am. I'm a fucking idiot.
-I'm not lying, Kate.

952
00:58:13,827 --> 00:58:15,662
[Cindy] This movie is
a lot of stress on me.

953
00:58:15,746 --> 00:58:16,872
[Frank] Oh, so take your estrogen.

954
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:18,790
-[Cindy] I did.
-[Frank] Take some more.

955
00:58:18,874 --> 00:58:20,834
[Frank] I don't care.
I really don't care. It's not my problem.

956
00:58:20,918 --> 00:58:23,337
I didn't say it was your fucking problem,
shithead.

957
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,797
-I didn't ask you for shit.
-You're the star. OK?

958
00:58:25,881 --> 00:58:28,050
I don't want anything to do with this.
Alright?

959
00:58:28,133 --> 00:58:29,801
Get that thing out of my face.
I'm done filming.

960
00:58:29,885 --> 00:58:31,345
-[Cindy] You owe him.
-I'm done filming.

961
00:58:31,428 --> 00:58:33,847
-You owe him, mister.
-You shut up. Let me talk. OK?

962
00:58:33,931 --> 00:58:35,933
Sit down. Sit down.

963
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:42,231
What are you trying to accomplish here,
GJ?

964
00:58:43,732 --> 00:58:45,567
I'm making a biography.

965
00:58:45,651 --> 00:58:48,445
-Of what?
-[GJ] Of my life.

966
00:58:50,072 --> 00:58:51,406
Of our lives.

967
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:52,908
[Frank] Don't you think
you have enough footage?

968
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:54,159
Leave him alone.

969
00:58:54,243 --> 00:58:56,537
I don't like everyone knowing
our business. Originally...

970
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:59,248
Oh, who cares?
Who are these fucking people?

971
00:58:59,331 --> 00:59:00,332
Shut up!

972
00:59:02,668 --> 00:59:05,546
You're really pissing me off.
And there's no reason for that.

973
00:59:09,716 --> 00:59:11,635
What is it that is so great
about your life

974
00:59:11,718 --> 00:59:14,263
that you think you need to be filming
in the house all the time?

975
00:59:14,346 --> 00:59:16,139
[Cindy] What kind of question is that?

976
00:59:16,223 --> 00:59:19,101
You see, the movie is stressing your
mother out and she's taking it out on me.

977
00:59:19,184 --> 00:59:21,728
No, I'm not stressed out.
Let's go clean up the backyard.

978
00:59:21,812 --> 00:59:23,522
It's not some fucking picture show,
you know?

979
00:59:23,605 --> 00:59:25,607
What are you doing with your life, GJ?

980
00:59:26,775 --> 00:59:29,945
How are you making money? Aren't you a
little bit old to be living in the house?

981
00:59:30,028 --> 00:59:31,154
I thought you were a genius?

982
00:59:31,238 --> 00:59:34,658
I think you should be killed!
Talking to him like that.

983
00:59:34,741 --> 00:59:37,703
Isn't your whole goal
to make me look like an asshole?

984
00:59:37,786 --> 00:59:40,330
I fucking hate you, OK?

985
00:59:40,414 --> 00:59:42,958
I hate every fucking fat bone
in your body.

986
00:59:45,544 --> 00:59:47,004
Fuck it.

987
00:59:51,133 --> 00:59:54,094
[Frank] Don't you follow me.
Don't follow me.

988
00:59:54,178 --> 00:59:55,762
Don't you follow me.

989
00:59:55,846 --> 00:59:58,974
[Cindy] After you spent all his money
buying all this goddamn equipment.

990
00:59:59,057 --> 01:00:01,101
[Frank] The equipment is shit!
You get that thing out of my face.

991
01:00:01,185 --> 01:00:03,520
-[Cindy gasps / camera smashes]
-[GJ] What the fuck!

992
01:00:05,731 --> 01:00:07,399
[Cindy] It's OK, GJ.

993
01:00:20,245 --> 01:00:22,706
[emotional music]

994
01:01:14,716 --> 01:01:16,468
Ah!

995
01:01:17,261 --> 01:01:18,303
Hey, Dad.

996
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:24,935
GJ! Glad to see you finally came
to your senses, man.

997
01:01:26,019 --> 01:01:27,062
Yeah.

998
01:01:35,487 --> 01:01:38,782
Come on in, man.
Hurry up so the cats don't get out.

999
01:01:38,866 --> 01:01:41,869
OK. It smells like a tuna melt in here.

1000
01:01:41,952 --> 01:01:44,121
-What's that?
-Nothing.

1001
01:01:44,204 --> 01:01:46,790
Alright. This is it, man.

1002
01:01:47,416 --> 01:01:50,961
That's the guitars.
That's the video equipment.

1003
01:01:51,044 --> 01:01:52,838
-Nice.
-And that's that.

1004
01:01:52,921 --> 01:01:56,967
There's the cats around. Well, there's
Tiny. Right here under the table.

1005
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:59,761
Tiny is a little warrior, man.

1006
01:01:59,845 --> 01:02:02,306
Did you know that we have warrior blood
in our family? Did you know that?

1007
01:02:02,389 --> 01:02:04,808
I think, yeah, I remember
you telling me that last time.

1008
01:02:04,892 --> 01:02:07,102
This is... I don't know whose cat it is.

1009
01:02:07,186 --> 01:02:09,438
[plays guitar]

1010
01:02:12,191 --> 01:02:14,610
You know, you just might be
better than Frank.

1011
01:02:14,693 --> 01:02:16,153
I am definitely better than Frank.

1012
01:02:16,236 --> 01:02:19,948
-I'm better than Frank.
-Mm-hmm. That's right.

1013
01:02:20,032 --> 01:02:21,950
-Frank stanks.
-Yeah, he does.

1014
01:02:22,034 --> 01:02:24,620
[laughs] Frank stanks. Hey, what's up?

1015
01:02:26,496 --> 01:02:29,666
How's it going with the girls?

1016
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:33,879
Oh, that's a long story
filled with many sides.

1017
01:02:36,715 --> 01:02:40,886
I've actually...
I've hiked up all these hills.

1018
01:02:40,969 --> 01:02:45,015
I've hiked up all the hills in the
mountains of any significance around here.

1019
01:02:45,098 --> 01:02:47,434
Boom-block! Boom-block!

1020
01:02:47,518 --> 01:02:50,521
X-block. It's all about the X-block.

1021
01:02:50,604 --> 01:02:54,900
Gotta use the X-block, right?
You gotta run some distraction, too.

1022
01:02:54,983 --> 01:02:58,320
Hey, buddy. What are you talking about?
I don't want to fight.

1023
01:02:58,403 --> 01:03:01,740
What do you mean
what's up with my hands? What? Boom!

1024
01:03:03,325 --> 01:03:04,201
Fight's over.

1025
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:12,084
Come on.

1026
01:03:14,127 --> 01:03:16,255
-Is your foot OK?
-No.

1027
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:21,343
-Honey swirl penis.
-Nice.

1028
01:03:23,762 --> 01:03:25,681
Petrified mammalian tusk.

1029
01:03:27,224 --> 01:03:29,476
That's a baby dinobite.

1030
01:03:33,021 --> 01:03:35,607
How did you and my mom meet?

1031
01:03:36,441 --> 01:03:41,196
It was a trap.
We had a great time at first. Beautiful.

1032
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,533
I mean, we would party all the time,
play music.

1033
01:03:44,616 --> 01:03:48,495
-And she was a sex machine, man.
-Mm.

1034
01:03:48,579 --> 01:03:50,747
No, I'm serious. The best I ever had.

1035
01:03:50,831 --> 01:03:54,168
-Maybe leave that part out, I think.
-It's an important part.

1036
01:03:54,251 --> 01:03:56,461
-Well, I don't know.
-I mean, we would go for days. Days.

1037
01:03:56,545 --> 01:04:00,465
Bottom line, she just wanted my genes.
She had it all planned out.

1038
01:04:00,549 --> 01:04:03,760
As soon as you were born,
she was fucking out of there.

1039
01:04:03,844 --> 01:04:05,888
Wizard-head Decepticon.

1040
01:04:06,972 --> 01:04:12,352
But you cheated on her and...
were doing drugs and stuff, right?

1041
01:04:12,436 --> 01:04:14,730
I don't know. You don't have to believe
everything your mother says.

1042
01:04:14,813 --> 01:04:16,982
Yeah, but you probably did
a lot of it, right?

1043
01:04:17,065 --> 01:04:21,528
What about what I was putting up with?
Cindy is crazy. She would drink all day.

1044
01:04:21,612 --> 01:04:23,488
-But she actually stopped drinking.
-Oh, again?

1045
01:04:23,572 --> 01:04:25,407
Yeah, she really did.

1046
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:27,784
That's the only reason why I can live in
that house for more than five minutes.

1047
01:04:27,868 --> 01:04:30,204
And actually, since she stopped drinking,
I kinda...

1048
01:04:30,287 --> 01:04:34,833
I don't know, I kinda like
being around her a little bit.

1049
01:04:34,917 --> 01:04:37,961
-So why you up here?
-Because of Frank.

1050
01:04:38,045 --> 01:04:41,215
Frank's a good guy. He's alright.

1051
01:04:41,298 --> 01:04:43,717
What do you mean Frank is an alright guy?

1052
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,178
I mean like it's amazing
that he puts up with her.

1053
01:04:46,261 --> 01:04:48,055
-He's never had a job.
-OK.

1054
01:04:48,138 --> 01:04:49,681
Alright? He's had a bunch of affairs.

1055
01:04:49,765 --> 01:04:52,768
She's been with him the whole time
and taking care of him.

1056
01:04:52,851 --> 01:04:58,190
I mean, I hear ya. I hear ya. But I mean,
they've been together 20 years.

1057
01:04:58,273 --> 01:05:00,609
-They're miserable!
-They must be doing something right.

1058
01:05:00,692 --> 01:05:03,153
They're trapped. They're miserable.
They are co-dependent

1059
01:05:03,237 --> 01:05:05,030
and they're too weak to leave.
That's all it is.

1060
01:05:05,113 --> 01:05:10,035
Look, I don't know. I don't know
their life. I mean, I can't judge them.

1061
01:05:10,118 --> 01:05:12,704
I mean, you think
relationships are a trap?

1062
01:05:12,788 --> 01:05:16,166
Look at me. I thought
I could go it myself forever.

1063
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:21,255
And now I'm stuck in Needles, California,
the asshole of the earth.

1064
01:05:21,338 --> 01:05:24,883
I'm trying to make friends
at a fucking gas station.

1065
01:05:24,967 --> 01:05:26,844
You know what that's like?
"Hey, buddy, what's up?

1066
01:05:26,927 --> 01:05:30,264
"What kind of Slurpee you like? Really,
cherry? I kind of like the Coke one."

1067
01:05:30,347 --> 01:05:32,015
Shit.

1068
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:39,106
But that book you wrote.
And all the women and...

1069
01:05:39,189 --> 01:05:43,652
-You slept with all the...
-Yeah. I did. I slept with a lot of women.

1070
01:05:43,735 --> 01:05:46,113
-There you go. That's...
-It's not worth shit.

1071
01:05:46,196 --> 01:05:49,283
This is what I got now. You know?
This is what I got.

1072
01:05:49,366 --> 01:05:53,745
I got my cats. I got Tiny.
I got Trouble. I got Sasha.

1073
01:05:53,829 --> 01:05:56,081
And, honestly, I'm probably gonna
die in that trailer

1074
01:05:56,164 --> 01:05:59,543
and my cats are gonna end up
eating me. I don't know.

1075
01:06:02,713 --> 01:06:05,841
[cat meows]

1076
01:06:12,222 --> 01:06:14,516
[cat meows]

1077
01:06:25,652 --> 01:06:29,323
-Where you going? You leaving?
-I had a job interview...

1078
01:06:31,074 --> 01:06:33,160
...and they called me
and I think I have to get home.

1079
01:06:33,243 --> 01:06:36,830
I thought we were gonna tool around
and, you know, shoot some cans.

1080
01:06:36,914 --> 01:06:39,374
Yeah, I think next time
we're gonna have to do that.

1081
01:06:40,959 --> 01:06:42,377
I get it.

1082
01:06:43,128 --> 01:06:47,674
You know, I'll give you a ride if you
promise to pick up the phone sometimes.

1083
01:06:47,758 --> 01:06:52,763
Let me talk for about 30 minutes
each time...

1084
01:06:52,846 --> 01:06:55,641
about whatever I want to talk about.

1085
01:06:55,724 --> 01:06:57,309
-I'll do that, yeah.
-Really?

1086
01:06:57,392 --> 01:06:58,685
I really will.

1087
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:07,444
[dial tone]

1088
01:07:10,739 --> 01:07:13,200
[Kate] <i>Hey, it's Kate. Leave a message.</i>

1089
01:07:13,283 --> 01:07:14,785
[beep]

1090
01:07:17,663 --> 01:07:20,541
[electronic evil laughter]

1091
01:07:27,089 --> 01:07:31,009
[electronic evil laughter]

1092
01:07:39,852 --> 01:07:40,978
Hi, sweetheart.

1093
01:07:42,521 --> 01:07:44,982
Do you just sense whenever I'm here?

1094
01:07:45,065 --> 01:07:48,235
-Well, it's the dawn of a new era.
-You don't have to say all that.

1095
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:50,362
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
You gotta hear me out.

1096
01:07:50,445 --> 01:07:54,366
Just hear me out for a second.
I think that the old version of me

1097
01:07:54,449 --> 01:07:56,994
would expect that
something different would happen.

1098
01:07:57,077 --> 01:07:59,329
Especially after everything
that went down the other night.

1099
01:07:59,413 --> 01:08:02,916
But I think I know better now.

1100
01:08:02,999 --> 01:08:07,880
I don't know what it is that you and Frank
have. I think Frank is an ass...

1101
01:08:07,963 --> 01:08:10,674
but if it works for you
and it makes you happy...

1102
01:08:10,757 --> 01:08:12,050
No, it doesn't make me happy.

1103
01:08:12,134 --> 01:08:15,721
Then I think the best thing for me to do
is just stop getting involved.

1104
01:08:15,804 --> 01:08:18,807
[Frank] Honey, where'd you put
the trash bags?

1105
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:20,767
Aren't they in the downstairs cabinet?

1106
01:08:20,851 --> 01:08:23,478
No, I looked in the downstairs cabinet.
Are you filming up there?

1107
01:08:23,562 --> 01:08:28,317
-I asked him to do no more filming.
-No. He's not filming, fucking shithead!

1108
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,902
He's still mad?

1109
01:08:29,985 --> 01:08:32,404
He didn't even apologize
for breaking my camera.

1110
01:08:32,487 --> 01:08:34,531
No, no, no. He said he fixed it.
It's in there.

1111
01:08:35,365 --> 01:08:38,577
He still doesn't want to be filmed
and he's not speaking to me

1112
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:40,037
and wants a divorce, but...

1113
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,789
Anyway, listen, I've got a plan.

1114
01:08:42,873 --> 01:08:48,170
Three words. OXO. Reunion. Concert.

1115
01:08:49,129 --> 01:08:52,132
Here's the deal. You need a big ending.

1116
01:08:52,216 --> 01:08:55,135
You gotta finish this project
and it's just gotta be big.

1117
01:08:55,219 --> 01:08:57,346
-I'm not filming anymore.
-What?

1118
01:08:57,429 --> 01:09:00,682
Yeah, I just... I'm not.
I just decided-- I think that...

1119
01:09:00,766 --> 01:09:02,851
-No, no, no, no. Honey...
-It interferes too much.

1120
01:09:02,935 --> 01:09:04,186
It just provokes you guys and...

1121
01:09:04,269 --> 01:09:07,523
You were so happy, GJ. You were so happy.
You were coming in here all the time.

1122
01:09:07,606 --> 01:09:10,025
You were getting on the computer,
telling me how many hits you got.

1123
01:09:10,108 --> 01:09:13,362
You gotta finish this project.
And it's gotta be big.

1124
01:09:13,445 --> 01:09:16,365
And I've got the hook that's gonna make
everybody want to see your movie.

1125
01:09:16,448 --> 01:09:20,202
Cos it can't just be, you know,
two people bickering back and forth.

1126
01:09:20,285 --> 01:09:23,288
I mean, you gotta have, like,
lights and crowds

1127
01:09:23,372 --> 01:09:26,792
and-and-and people and explosions.

1128
01:09:27,626 --> 01:09:31,421
Listen, I've been in contact with Orlando.
Don't tell him that.

1129
01:09:31,505 --> 01:09:33,423
Cos I dated him too, you know.

1130
01:09:33,507 --> 01:09:36,844
He said that he's up for doing this.
Like a big show.

1131
01:09:36,927 --> 01:09:39,513
And all the money will be to pay you back.

1132
01:09:39,596 --> 01:09:42,391
-Everything.
-How are you even gonna do that?

1133
01:09:42,474 --> 01:09:45,143
You and Frank aren't
even talking right now.

1134
01:09:45,227 --> 01:09:49,815
[scoffs] That'll work out.
I mean, come on. Visualize it.

1135
01:09:49,898 --> 01:09:53,360
Frank up there rocking out
in all his fat glory.

1136
01:09:55,946 --> 01:09:59,032
-Yeah, that would be pretty good.
-Yes.

1137
01:09:59,116 --> 01:10:01,451
Can you get Frank on board?

[Kate] <i>Hey, it's Kate. Leave a message.</i>

1140
01:11:27,746 --> 01:11:31,166
[Cindy] Geej, look, just blame it on me.
I mean... [stammers]

1141
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:34,795
I'll say that she was a friend from work
and you didn't want her to stay there,

1142
01:11:34,878 --> 01:11:37,297
but she had so much to drink
that I insisted.

1143
01:11:37,381 --> 01:11:41,510
And that it just looked more than it was.
I mean, if you love this girl, then...

1144
01:11:41,593 --> 01:11:45,097
I mean, you don't love her, right?

1145
01:11:47,015 --> 01:11:50,853
I mean, yeah, I have the love chemicals.
I have that going on,

1146
01:11:50,936 --> 01:11:54,731
but that's over in 18 to 24 months, so...

1147
01:11:55,649 --> 01:11:59,444
-I'm gonna be just fine.
-Is that a joke?

1148
01:12:00,112 --> 01:12:03,699
I messed up, you know? Whatever.
I have to deal with that.

1149
01:12:04,575 --> 01:12:05,993
OK.

1150
01:12:16,712 --> 01:12:18,672
You're calling this a cancer benefit?

1151
01:12:18,755 --> 01:12:22,050
That's just to get people in the door.
Come on.

1152
01:12:23,051 --> 01:12:24,928
That's fucked up.

<i>It's not my problem.</i>

1158
01:12:39,568 --> 01:12:43,488
[Cindy] <i>Well, I didn't say it was your</i>

Alright, pie.

1167
01:13:45,217 --> 01:13:46,760
Gosh, thank you.

1168
01:13:46,844 --> 01:13:50,681
You're welcome. There you go.
Anything else for you guys?

1169
01:13:50,764 --> 01:13:53,183
No? No more? OK.

1170
01:13:53,267 --> 01:13:55,936
Sorry about the wait. I've been...

1171
01:14:00,107 --> 01:14:00,941
Hi.

1172
01:14:02,985 --> 01:14:05,904
-What's up?
-How you doing?

1173
01:14:07,656 --> 01:14:10,576
-Do you like my thyme boutonniere?
-You look like an idiot.

1174
01:14:10,659 --> 01:14:12,494
Thank you. I agree. You should put that--

1175
01:14:12,578 --> 01:14:18,667
You must feel, like, pretty shitty working
here after going to college at, like, ten.

1176
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:22,963
You know what? The truth of it is,
I'm getting used to it.

1177
01:14:23,046 --> 01:14:26,216
I love mayonnaise and I go home
every night smelling like mayonnaise

1178
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:28,427
so it's just an additional perk.

1179
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:30,429
What are you gonna do, you know?

1180
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:38,353
Well, I came here cos
I wanted to tell you that...

1181
01:14:38,437 --> 01:14:41,190
I like that video you made for <i>Manly Shit.</i>

1182
01:14:41,273 --> 01:14:44,484
-You did?
-Yeah, it was really cool.

1183
01:14:44,568 --> 01:14:48,780
That took me, like, a week and a half. I
was... Shit. My manager just looked at me.

1184
01:14:52,826 --> 01:14:55,204
So did you come here just to see me?

1185
01:14:56,121 --> 01:14:58,415
Your mom called me actually.

1186
01:14:58,498 --> 01:15:03,378
She wanted me to invite
all my friends to the cancer benefit.

1187
01:15:04,796 --> 01:15:07,508
Oh, my God. I'm really sorry.

1188
01:15:07,591 --> 01:15:09,927
We mostly talked about you.

1189
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:12,387
What'd she say?

1190
01:15:12,471 --> 01:15:16,934
She said that you were desperate...

1191
01:15:18,101 --> 01:15:19,394
...and lonely and...

1192
01:15:20,854 --> 01:15:23,690
She basically painted
this whole sob story.

1193
01:15:23,774 --> 01:15:27,277
Told me the only reason
she gave birth to you

1194
01:15:27,361 --> 01:15:33,408
is because she had to spend
the abortion money on the electric bill.

1195
01:15:34,993 --> 01:15:36,995
[laughs]

1196
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:44,795
-Oh, man. That's...
-It's shitty.

1197
01:15:48,215 --> 01:15:50,968
I haven't heard that one before.

1198
01:15:53,971 --> 01:15:55,514
So, friends?

1199
01:15:57,140 --> 01:16:00,727
-There's something I need you to do.
-What?

1200
01:16:03,689 --> 01:16:05,566
Tell me the truth about
what happened the other night.

1201
01:16:06,942 --> 01:16:09,862
-What are you talking about?
-You fucked another girl.

1202
01:16:11,071 --> 01:16:13,657
I need you to say that to my face.

1203
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:16,118
I don't understand why you're saying that.
You don't know what I--

1204
01:16:16,201 --> 01:16:18,787
You could have all this wrong. You really
have no idea what happened...

1205
01:16:18,871 --> 01:16:20,289
GJ.

1206
01:16:23,667 --> 01:16:26,670
-I don't know why you're doing this.
-Just fucking say it.

1207
01:16:27,212 --> 01:16:28,797
Alright.

1208
01:16:32,259 --> 01:16:33,760
Bye.

1209
01:16:37,472 --> 01:16:38,390
OK.

1210
01:16:41,602 --> 01:16:43,353
I fucked another girl.

1211
01:16:45,355 --> 01:16:46,565
[Kate] Fuck.

[sniffles]

1213
01:16:56,200 --> 01:17:01,121
OK. OK. I needed to hear that.

1214
01:17:02,414 --> 01:17:05,167
I'm not gonna make any excuses.

1215
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:07,461
That's what I would do right now
and I'm not gonna do that.

1216
01:17:07,544 --> 01:17:10,047
I'm just really, really,
really, really, really sorry.

1217
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:13,342
I've been pointing my fingers
at all these people,

1218
01:17:13,425 --> 01:17:16,970
and all along I've just been doing
the most despicable shit.

1219
01:17:21,266 --> 01:17:22,684
OK.

1220
01:17:26,104 --> 01:17:29,608
I really want to put my arms around you
right now but I know I don't deserve to.

1221
01:17:31,443 --> 01:17:36,114
No, you don't really, but... fuck it.

1222
01:17:40,536 --> 01:17:43,205
I'm really, really sorry.

1223
01:17:43,288 --> 01:17:46,291
I know you probably don't believe that,
but I...

1224
01:17:48,085 --> 01:17:49,294
I really am.

1225
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:53,340
I slept with my ex-boyfriend.

1226
01:17:57,553 --> 01:17:59,096
You're talking about dog penis?

1227
01:18:00,305 --> 01:18:01,473
Yeah.

1228
01:18:01,557 --> 01:18:05,644
-When did you do that?
-It doesn't matter.

1229
01:18:06,311 --> 01:18:07,729
But I guess we're even.

1230
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:11,233
We're really awesome people, aren't we?

1231
01:18:17,698 --> 01:18:22,202
So... friends or...?

1232
01:18:25,873 --> 01:18:27,541
We'll see.

1233
01:18:34,047 --> 01:18:34,965
Hi, honey.

1234
01:18:36,258 --> 01:18:37,134
Hi.

1235
01:18:39,303 --> 01:18:41,513
Oh, you look tired.

1236
01:18:42,472 --> 01:18:44,308
I'm alright.

1237
01:18:49,396 --> 01:18:50,272
What?

1238
01:18:54,151 --> 01:18:55,277
[sighs]

1239
01:18:56,069 --> 01:18:57,613
Come on.

1240
01:18:57,696 --> 01:18:59,406
[Eighties music plays]

1241
01:19:00,407 --> 01:19:01,950
[whispers] What's going on with Frank?

1242
01:19:02,034 --> 01:19:05,787
I smoked him out with a pizza last night.

1243
01:19:05,871 --> 01:19:09,499
He was incommunicado and once I said--
He goes, "What's in?"

1244
01:19:09,583 --> 01:19:12,419
Finally, I said, "Well, I think I'm
gonna..." "What's to eat?"

1245
01:19:12,503 --> 01:19:17,049
I said, "I think I'm getting a pizza." All
of a sudden he came right out of there.

1246
01:19:17,132 --> 01:19:20,135
So he's writing some tracks
for the big show,

1247
01:19:20,219 --> 01:19:23,889
and I think he might be amenable
to one last interview.

1248
01:19:23,972 --> 01:19:26,183
With a few more pizzas.

1249
01:19:26,266 --> 01:19:28,560
Did you force him into this somehow?

1250
01:19:28,644 --> 01:19:32,272
No. He wants to do it,
but I think he's nervous.

1251
01:19:32,356 --> 01:19:36,777
But he knows there's some element
of parody to this, doesn't he?

1252
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:41,240
Even if he suspects it,
he doesn't think it's gonna be that way.

1253
01:19:41,323 --> 01:19:43,492
I mean, he thinks he's gonna rock it.

1254
01:19:43,575 --> 01:19:46,620
-And I mean, rock it!
-I feel kind of bad now.

1255
01:19:46,703 --> 01:19:49,915
Honey, would you like some more cereal?

1256
01:19:49,998 --> 01:19:53,001
-[Frank] Not hungry.
-[Cindy] Jesus.

1257
01:19:54,294 --> 01:19:57,798
I have to be really nice to him. OK.

1258
01:19:58,966 --> 01:20:01,969
[GJ] So tomorrow's the big event.

1259
01:20:02,052 --> 01:20:07,182
[Frank] Yeah. First time I've played live
in 20 years. Fucking A!

1260
01:20:07,266 --> 01:20:09,643
So you're not gonna back out, are you?

1261
01:20:09,726 --> 01:20:13,480
No. No. Happy to play
for your friends, you know?

1262
01:20:13,564 --> 01:20:16,275
What? It's gonna be ten people
or something, right? It's just like a--

1263
01:20:16,358 --> 01:20:18,569
The motherfucking thing is bright, man.

1264
01:20:18,652 --> 01:20:21,113
How about that? Is that better?
Is that in your face less?

1265
01:20:21,196 --> 01:20:23,073
Is that good? A little lower?

1266
01:20:23,156 --> 01:20:25,033
Why are you catering to me so much, man?

1267
01:20:26,118 --> 01:20:30,664
Um... I don't know.
Because we have to do this interview.

1268
01:20:31,415 --> 01:20:36,336
I'm fat. My teeth are ugly. I'm old.

1269
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:40,632
But I'm happy, Geej. You know,
I'm happy in my misery. Right, Geej?

1270
01:20:40,716 --> 01:20:44,136
OK, so. If you could somehow

1271
01:20:44,219 --> 01:20:49,266
take advantage of this documentary
and give a message to the entire world,

1272
01:20:49,349 --> 01:20:50,684
what would it be?

1273
01:20:50,767 --> 01:20:54,521
Lead or follow...

1274
01:20:54,605 --> 01:20:56,565
or get the fuck out of the way.

1275
01:20:56,648 --> 01:20:57,983
That's my message.

1276
01:20:58,066 --> 01:21:01,403
Lead or follow...

1277
01:21:02,446 --> 01:21:04,281
...or get the fuck out of the way.

1278
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:07,868
Cool. Yeah.

1279
01:21:08,702 --> 01:21:12,247
Um, I wanted to ask you about something.

1280
01:21:12,331 --> 01:21:13,373
Uh...

1281
01:21:16,043 --> 01:21:18,795
Is my mom drinking again?

1282
01:21:20,839 --> 01:21:21,882
No.

1283
01:21:21,965 --> 01:21:24,593
Is that why you quit the documentary?

1284
01:21:24,676 --> 01:21:29,431
No, no, no, no. It's all me.
I'm the drunken asshole in the house.

1285
01:21:29,515 --> 01:21:34,144
OK. Well, I just-- I wanted to say that
if you quit the documentary

1286
01:21:34,228 --> 01:21:36,730
because she's drinking
and you took the heat for that,

1287
01:21:36,813 --> 01:21:40,317
I just wanted to say that I appreciate it.

1288
01:21:41,777 --> 01:21:44,905
GJ, I promise you, it's all under control.
There's nothing to worry about.

1289
01:21:44,988 --> 01:21:47,616
-OK? I got it.
-OK.

1290
01:21:49,076 --> 01:21:50,577
OK, moving on.

1291
01:21:54,206 --> 01:22:00,546
One thing that I think...
was a major event in my adolescence

1292
01:22:00,629 --> 01:22:02,297
was the whole...

1293
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:07,511
...the suicide attempt that was, um...

1294
01:22:09,346 --> 01:22:12,683
...you know. I just think we have yet
to discuss it. It was such a...

1295
01:22:12,766 --> 01:22:16,270
Then maybe we should talk about it.
I considered talking about it. Um...

1296
01:22:17,271 --> 01:22:19,648
Well, what happened was...

1297
01:22:25,028 --> 01:22:28,323
I took these drugs
that didn't agree with me, alright?

1298
01:22:28,407 --> 01:22:31,034
First of all, I can't take pills. OK?

1299
01:22:31,118 --> 01:22:35,581
The only pills I can take are
Black Beauty, Quaalude, Vicodin.

1300
01:22:35,664 --> 01:22:38,375
Man, that shit is good.

1301
01:22:38,458 --> 01:22:42,713
Speed is wonderful, you know?

1302
01:22:42,796 --> 01:22:45,007
Black Beauty... Whoo!

1303
01:22:45,966 --> 01:22:51,305
Oh, yeah. So my brother-in-law came over
and he's, "Let's play some pool."

1304
01:22:51,388 --> 01:22:53,849
You know, and he had some coke.

1305
01:22:53,932 --> 01:22:55,559
I was like, "Yeah, that'll wake me up."

1306
01:22:55,642 --> 01:22:58,228
And so I did that on top of the pills
I'd already taken.

1307
01:22:58,312 --> 01:23:03,150
You know, and then I came home
and I was not in a good mood.

1308
01:23:03,233 --> 01:23:06,737
And I was just so sad and depressed.

1309
01:23:07,654 --> 01:23:13,952
And I felt like I have been
the doom of my life.

1310
01:23:14,828 --> 01:23:17,539
Of myself, of my family...

1311
01:23:17,623 --> 01:23:20,250
of everything that I wanted to accomplish.

1312
01:23:20,918 --> 01:23:24,421
I am the key to fucking everything up.

1313
01:23:26,089 --> 01:23:28,842
And so I, um...

1314
01:23:28,926 --> 01:23:33,305
I kind of punished myself and, um...

1315
01:23:33,388 --> 01:23:38,018
...eventually, I, uh...
I trashed the apartment.

1316
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:41,271
You know? And if I remember correctly,

1317
01:23:41,355 --> 01:23:47,236
I, um... I picked up that sword
that you had.

1318
01:23:47,319 --> 01:23:50,239
The Indiana Jones sword
that you eventually sold,

1319
01:23:50,322 --> 01:23:54,993
and I asked you to kill me.

1320
01:23:56,161 --> 01:24:00,165
And I positioned it to my chest...

1321
01:24:00,249 --> 01:24:02,334
and I got down on my knees.

1322
01:24:05,796 --> 01:24:07,464
And I asked...

1323
01:24:11,176 --> 01:24:14,763
"Rid me of this fucking pain."

1324
01:24:16,098 --> 01:24:19,685
It was a... a selfish act...

1325
01:24:20,978 --> 01:24:22,896
...and a stupid thing to do.

1326
01:24:26,775 --> 01:24:30,320
I think it was hard for me
cos I was just...

1327
01:24:31,154 --> 01:24:33,866
I was 12 years old.

1328
01:24:33,949 --> 01:24:38,787
The only person I ever wanted to hurt
was myself. You know?

1329
01:24:38,871 --> 01:24:42,833
If you had to guess what I thought
about you, what would it be?

1330
01:24:45,085 --> 01:24:48,797
Well, I wouldn't want...
wouldn't want to know.

1331
01:24:48,881 --> 01:24:51,175
-Why not?
-It might not be a good thing.

I love you, GJ. I want the best for you.

1334
01:25:00,517 --> 01:25:03,353
The proudest moment of my life
was marrying your mother.

1335
01:25:06,690 --> 01:25:09,735

1452
01:33:01,123 --> 01:33:04,001
Well, at least that's not a ten.

1453
01:33:04,084 --> 01:33:07,546
No, I'd say six.

1454
01:33:07,629 --> 01:33:09,756
-Six.
-Eight.

1455
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:12,551
Seven. Seven seems right.

1456
01:33:14,136 --> 01:33:18,140
-Are you happier now?
-Sure.

1457
01:33:19,016 --> 01:33:22,561
-Are you really?
-Yeah.

1458
01:33:24,438 --> 01:33:27,107
-Whoo!
-Come on, GJ.

1459
01:33:27,191 --> 01:33:30,194
Yeah, I'm happier. I mean, I...

1460
01:33:30,277 --> 01:33:35,699
I'm still here, which is a shock to me.

1461
01:33:35,782 --> 01:33:38,035
That's something to be happy about.

1462
01:33:38,118 --> 01:33:42,539
Yeah. OK, well, so...

1463
01:33:42,623 --> 01:33:48,337
OK. Well, I can't find my actual question.
My papers are all messed up. Hold on.

1464
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:53,425
Um, something occurred to me
while I was filming. I, uh...

1465
01:33:55,260 --> 01:34:00,182
I realized that I never, as
far as I can ever remember,

1466
01:34:00,265 --> 01:34:02,726
um, told you that I love you.

1467
01:34:06,230 --> 01:34:09,358
-And...
-Oh, I know you do.

1468
01:34:11,527 --> 01:34:13,362
Yeah.

1469
01:34:14,071 --> 01:34:17,074
-So for the record, I love you.
-What's going on in here?

1470

1471
01:34:19,201 --> 01:34:22,204
-GJ loves me.
-Oh.

1472
01:34:22,287 --> 01:34:23,539
Do you love me?

1473
01:34:28,794 --> 01:34:34,258
Well, if I did, I would never be able
to say it to your face. So...

1474
01:34:35,467 --> 01:34:38,887
-That's pretty good.
-That's really good.

1475
01:34:38,971 --> 01:34:42,307
-That's good enough.
-It is.

1476
01:34:43,517 --> 01:34:48,605
Oh, Frank. We missed his entire childhood.

1477
01:34:48,689 --> 01:34:51,191
Now we can spend time with him.

1478
01:34:51,275 --> 01:34:54,653
Is it too late? What do you think?

1479
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:57,489
I don't think so.
