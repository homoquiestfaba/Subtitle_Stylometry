00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:03,712
(dramatic music)

00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,100
(tapping)

00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,522
- The tackler flash
coming through.

00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,108
- Radio, con, bring
the message to con.

00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,861
(buzzing)
(people chattering)

00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,904
- [Man] Go, go, go!

00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,155
Watch your back!
- Hurry.

00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:12,781
- I got it.
- Watch your back.

00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:13,740
Let's hurry.

00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,242
- [Man] Here we go, here we go.

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,829
- This is it, Stevie.

00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,999
World War III begins.

00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,836
And all our wives
are back home in bed

00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,713
with our best friends.

00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,840
- Chief, that ain't
good coming from you.

00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,050
You're married too.

00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,426
There's certain things
a man doesn't do

00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,385
and that's one of them.

00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:37,013
- Ah, speak for yourself kid.

00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,890
All's fair in love
and war, right?

00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,391
(chuckles)

00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,851
- Advance sequence, make comment

00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:42,894
and two's ready for firing.

00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:43,895
(chattering)

00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,355
- Quality control's activated.

00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,648
- Open number one hatch.

00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,234
- [Sailor] Open hatch, aye, sir.

00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,402
(whirring)

00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,615
- [Radio] Bravo niner,
you're cleared on runway two.

00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,368
(dramatic music)

00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,418
One minute 34, one minute 35,

00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,504
one minute 36, one minute 37.

00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,548
(tapping)

00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,558
- [Man] Faster
gentlemen, faster.

00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,442
- [Radio] 226, 227, 228.

00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,485
- Hatch four open, sir.

00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,570
- Very well.

00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,619
- Nestor, Captain.

00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,207
- [Radio] 241, 242, 243,

00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,209
244, 245, 246, 47, 48.

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,963
- System's ready in this test.

00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,298
Have your men stand down, Arie.

00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,757
- Aye aye, sir.

00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,050
- [Man] Secure from
battle stations.

00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:56,968
- [Man] Just a test, boys.

00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,344
- Nice going, chief.

00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,305
Broke three minutes
for the first time.

00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,681
- Anyone else still the
same place to get laid,

00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:02,473
right, skipper?

00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,893
(laughter)

00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,236
- [Girl] No, no!

00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,112
Hey, no.

00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,740
(laughter)

00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,951
- Hey, put me down!
- No, we're not going to.

00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,119
- [Girl] No way!

00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,495
- Put him down.

00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,664
Oh!

00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,127
Oh no, how many
times have I told you

00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,504
to stay away from your
daddy's car, you bad boy?

00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,006
Go on.

00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,299
Look at you, you're filthy.

00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,842
I'll have to wash
all this again.

00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,052
Look at him strut.

00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,094
Just like his father.

00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,512
(laughter)

00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,015
(hammering)

00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:51,856
Hey.

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,401
Can I get you something?

00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,527
- Um.

00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,615
I'm Linda Bellamy.

00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,116
- How you doing?

00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,369
- I'm Lee's wife.

00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,706
- How, how can I help you?

00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,750
- Well I guess,

00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,337
I guess I just needed
to talk to someone.

00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,589
I guess to you, um.

00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,591
Has Johnny written you?

00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:23,137
- Johnny never writes.

00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,515
- He doesn't write me either.

00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,561
- I see.

00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,609
How long has this been going on?

00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,902
- He loves me.

00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,364
And I love him.

00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,742
And I'm gonna marry him.

00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,537
- Want a drink?

00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,498
Hmm?

00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,457
- No.
- No.

00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,213
Got a job?

00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,299
Did you ever have a job?

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,216
How about high school?

00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,843
Did you finish high school?

00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,386
- I haven't had time
for all of that.

00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,346
- Well, you better start

00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,473
'cause I don't think your
husband's gonna be giving you

00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,767
a lot of money if you're
running out on him.

00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,103
And then there's the,
uh, housing allotment

00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,189
and child support
for our four kids.

00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,278
- Mom.

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,362
Mommy.

00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,238
Hey, mom.

00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,656
Noah's hogging the hose.

00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,825
She won's let me spray.

00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,410
- This is Michael, our son.

00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,037
Michael say hello to the lady.

00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:29,912
- Hi.

00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,541
(phone rings)

00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,335
(sighs)

00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,420
- That's, uh...

00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,296
That's probably Lee.

00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,507
I told him I was coming here.

00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,968
Look, I'm sorry, okay.

00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,012
I'm sorry I bothered you.

00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,597
Just, just, uh...

00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,683
Tell him I went shopping, okay?

00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,603
I went shopping at the exchange.

00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,191
- Control, this is sonar,
we have a live one.

00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:01,694
Sounds like an Ivan Victor
Class contact bearing 155,

00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,447
range 1,000 yards and closing.

00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,533
- How the hell's
he gotten so close?

00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,287
- New bearing, one niner zero,

00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,290
distance 800 yards,
still closing.

00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,833
- Break ship for ultra quiet.

00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,960
Officer of the deck, make
your new depth 800 feet.

00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,921
- New depth 800
feet, aye aye, sir.

00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,631
- [Radio] Break
ship, ultra quite.

00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,174
- Ultra quite.

00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,552
- Contact all bears, one
niner one, ring stat.

00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,054
- Sonar.

00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,306
Patch audio into
the control room.

00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,226
Let's all hear what
Ivan sounds like.

00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,477
- He's blowing his
full in tanks, captain.

00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,978
He's still closing.

00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,814
- [Radio] 550 yards and closing.

00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,524
- Son of a bitch
is gonna nail us.

00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,484
- Listen, Stevie.

00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,778
Do you want to hear the
captain wet his pants?

00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,446
- [Radio] 450 yards.

00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:48,908
400 yards.

00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,286
350 yards, still closing.

00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:56,582
- [Man] Sparks, get the attack
cyper ready to transmit.

00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,836
- All cued up, sir.

00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,712
- [Man] Looks like
we're cued up, captain.

00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,381
- [Radio] 200 yards.

00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,384
150 yards.

00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:09,637
100 yards.

00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,974
50 yards.

00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,149
(sinister music)

00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,318
- Okay, tape apes,
another victory at sea.

00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,863
- It's like Ivan never
even knew we were here.

00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,322
Almost rammed us 'cause
he couldn't hear us

00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,949
in his own noise.

00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,909
Sounds like the
freeway at rush hour.

00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,827
- Yeah, if it weren't the enemy,

00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,287
I'd almost feel sorry for him.

00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,663
- [Man] Unbelievable.

00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,415
- Let's take it
down to 1,000 feet.

00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,167
Get under the thermal climb.

00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,585
- Helm, all head 2/3.

00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,170
Let's take her
down to 1,000 feet.

00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,463
(buzzing)

00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,380
- [John] Let's have
the documents checked,

00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,174
the full security lockdown.

00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,600
- [Woman] So why
don't you leave him?

00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,394
- Why did I marry
him is the question.

00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,729
I knew I was getting into

00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,482
the first minute I
laid eyes on him.

00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,359
He's the only man
besides my grandfather

00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:08,779
who's as smart as
he thinks he is.

00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,282
Johnny's the first guy I...

00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,994
I met that made me
feel like I was...

00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:18,080
On the inside track
going somewhere.

00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,294
Now I don't think I'm
smart enough for him.

00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,588
- Oh come on,
don't give me that.

00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,131
He's running around.

00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,425
He's got an itch
he can't scratch.

00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,219
That's not smart, that's horny.

00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,553
(laughs)

00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,472
- He's always horny.

00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:40,561
I don't know what he's gonna
do, what he's thinkin',

00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,522
what he wants.

00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,399
I like it.

00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,902
It's exciting.

00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,571
I don't know, sometimes I think

00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,365
there's something
really wrong with me.

00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,658
- So what are you gonna do?

00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,450
- Kill him.

00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,535
(laughs)

00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,619
- Then what?

00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,834
- He wants me to wear those
red panties he gave me.

00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,003
(laughs)

00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,506
I'm gonna.

00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,342
- What's so funny, Mom?

00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,803
(laughs)

00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,304
- [Barbara] Nothin'.

00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,223
(upbeat band music)

00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,099
- Hey!

00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,397
- [Man] Sir!

00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,360
(laughter)

00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,446
(ship horn blaring)

00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,492
- Baby!

00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,415
Well that's a hell of
a way to treat a sailor

00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,417
just home from the wars.

00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,543
- Maybe.

00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,631
- Come on, give us a kiss.

00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,425
- I don't think so.

00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,559
- Well now that you've
proven yourself to the boys,

00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,186
let's talk about the girls.

00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,396
- Okay, let's.

00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,273
- Linda Bellamy ring a bell?

00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,941
- [John] Lee's wife.

00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,362
- Come on, Johnny, I think
you can do better than that.

00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,364
- I honestly don't know
what you're talking about.

00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,450
- Well there must be
something you remember.

00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,201
She certainly remembers you.

00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:19,994
- Are you crazy?

00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,162
She's a zero.

00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,915
- [Barbara] Well that's
never stopped you before.

00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,626
- Come on, Barbara, I
never went near her.

00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,252
Who told you this?

00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,128
- She did.

00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,008
- Well wait a minute,
wait a minute.

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,760
I know what she's doing.

00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,762
Lee told me she's been trying
to get him to quit the Navy.

00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,055
That's why she came to you.

00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,849
She's just trying
to make him jealous.

00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,560
Hey, come on, come on.

00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,981
You don't buy that
crap, are ya, huh?

00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,943
- You have a really
bad track record.

00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:53,611
- We've been apart too much.

00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,365
I'm gonna get shore duty
so we can be together more.

00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,616
- Really?

00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,411
- Yeah, I want to
see more of the kids,

00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,414
take those picnics
like we used to.

00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:10,461
Move up, get a commission,
maybe like Art, huh?

00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:17,885
- Damn you.

00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:22,264
(engine rumbling)

00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,851
- Hey look, you
guys, he's coming!

00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:26,936
Come on.

00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,355
- Hurry!
- I want to see Daddy.

00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,273
- Come on.

00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,526
- Look, hon, uh...

00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,944
Art's in town, he
sent me a message.

00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,862
I'm meeting him for a drink.

00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,197
- It's your first night home.

00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:38,906
- Look, Barb, I gotta meet Art.

00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,784
I gotta borrow some money,
try to keep this place going.

00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,285
Maybe he can bring
some guys from his ship

00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,121
over drinking some night.

00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:45,996
Hey.

00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,417
I'll be home early.

00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,585
We'll make a night of it.

00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:57,049
- You could at least
say hello to the kids.

00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,635
- I won't be long.

00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:05,891
- Bye.

00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,062
- He's coming, he's coming!

00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,816
(engine rumbling)

00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,029
(laughter)

00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,323
- Hey, babe.

00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,617
Bring us two more
doubles, will you?

00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,703
Scotch with my name on
it and keep 'em coming.

00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,164
Hey, put your money up, Art.

00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,374
Charleston's my port.

00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,877
The thirst is my game, right?

00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:33,294
Hey.

00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,132
Nice buns, don't you think, Art?

00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,427
Honey, with your body, you
know what'd look good on you?

00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,303
- What?

00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,388
- Me.

00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:46,348
- Thank you, Johnny.

00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,225
(laughs)

00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,728
- How's the bar doing?

00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,439
- Well, the bar's doing alright.

00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,399
You know, we need to expand.

00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,358
You need to put a
little more money in it,

00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,277
another thousand at least.

00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,321
- Rita's already complaining
about the first thousand.

00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,407
- Ah, forget the bitches, right?

00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,868
Here's to us, the Walker boys.

00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,457
Listen, Art.

00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,834
You gotta have a
vision of it, man.

00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:17,630
I mean, I'd like for
it to be a place that

00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,924
Dad would want to drop
into for a few beers

00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,134
and sit at the bar
and shoot the breeze

00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,637
with all the old geezers,
play the big radio announcer.

00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:28,974
You remember, uh, this is Johnny
Walker, the night stalker,

00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,018
WJZA Scranton PA.

00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,353
These are my two sons.

00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,271
This is Arthur and
Johnny Walker, Jr.

00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,232
(chuckles)

00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,399
After a few rounds,

00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,402
he'd start buying shots
for the whole bar.

00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,363
- Yeah, it sounds
like Dad, all right.

00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,198
Johnny, listen, um.

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,325
A thousand's a lot
for me right now.

00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,202
- Having fun?

00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,328
- She gets off at 11.

00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,413
She's got a girlfriend,
real nice too.

00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,250
Hey, Irene, why don't you ask
Bobbie for my brother here

00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,709
and we'll make an
evening of it, huh?

00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,461
- You two couldn't
afford us, sailor boy.

00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,422
- Whew! (chuckles)

00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,301
- All right, sailor.

00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,386
What'd you learn today?

00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,012
Tell me something new.

00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,764
Tell me something I don't know.

00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,391
- [Girl] I know
something, let me.

00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,017
- Come on, girls, bed time.

00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,561
- Aw, Mom, do we
have to go to bed?

00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:14,520
- No, no, yes, you have to.

00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,397
- I don't want to go to bed now.

00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,857
- I don't care.
- But I'm the oldest.

00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,441
- [Barbara] Doesn't matter.

00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,027
- [Art] What about Barbara,
can't she make it good?

00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:25,447
- Ah, Barbara's up
to her butt in kids.

00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,368
She don't know what
a good time is.

00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,706
All she wants to do is
go on family picnics.

00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,583
I mean, look.

00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:39,128
Place called a Bamboo Bar has
gotta have some juice smashes,

00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,463
gotta be the kinda place
people want to come to

00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:44,675
and hang out and get loose,
you know what I mean?

00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,469
Barbara is not
your party person.

00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,891
All I ever wanted was a little
money making opportunity

00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,685
and I got the only bar
in the whole country

00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,603
that's losing money.

00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,522
Now what the hell am I gonna do?

00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,775
- Hold on, hold on, you
got a little, Johnny.

00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:02,818
But you gotta get something else

00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,279
going on the side besides girls.

00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,323
Find something to generate
a little extra cash.

00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,949
Find something else on the side.

00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,284
- Yeah, well how about you?

00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,329
What's your scam,
selling your hair?

00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,624
- Listen, you know when I
was stationed up in Groton,

00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,376
we knew a guy who had
connections with the mob.

00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,503
He'd buy all the electrical
pumps I could order.

00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,422
I used to deliver a
pump end of every month

00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,050
just to make ends meet.

00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,386
- A pump at the end of
every month? (chuckles)

00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,679
That's about your speed.

00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,806
(laughs)

00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,435
These girls like a
little feed first

00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,271
and then they like to go
somewhere and work it off.

00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,564
Hey, Irene!

00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,442
- Later, Johnny,
have a good night.

00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,115
- [Man] President Lyndon
Johnson reviews comment

00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,992
on today's anti-war protest

00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:55,579
as police estimated the
crowd at no more than 23,000.

00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,497
While organizers--

00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,958
- You can sleep with Michael.

00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,003
(door slams)

00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,592
- Stat at attention, sailor.

00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,593
- Yes, sir.

00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,976
- Tell me what you
learned today, sailor.

00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,937
Tell me something new,
something I don't know.

00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,605
- I missed you, Dad.

00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,694
(sighs)

00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,988
- It's you and me, sailor.

00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,450
You and me against the bitches.

00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,493
You understand?

00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,453
(police siren blaring)

00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,579
You go back to sleep.

00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,580
- Yes, sir.

00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,463
- [John] Let me in, Barb.

00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,426
Open the damn door.

00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,347
(thuds)
(gasps)

00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,849
- You're a liar.

00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,394
You weren't out
with Art this late.

00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,271
I know where you were.

00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,733
I'm sick of this bar.

00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,693
I'm sick of being broke.

00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,487
I'm sick of you running
around with all our money.

00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:14,533
- Yeah, maybe there's a
message in there somewhere.

00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,453
- You know what?

00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,662
Beer man cut us off today.

00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,956
You know what he wanted to do?

00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:24,752
He wanted to take out his
bill in trade with me.

00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,045
- [John] For that kinda money,

00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,213
maybe you shoulda
slept with him.

00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,465
Hey!

00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,841
- Is that what
you want me to do?

00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,218
You want me to
whore for you, huh?

00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:33,886
Well if I'm gonna get a pimp,

00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,804
I'm gonna get someone
who'll bring a little money

00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,639
into this house.
- Damn it!

00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,183
- [Barbara] Go on, run away!

00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,560
(door slams)

00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,487
- Come here, Mike.

00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,748
(birds chirping)

00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,088
- [Woman] Registered
materials delivery.

00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,590
Who's the custodian officer?

00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:16,136
- I'll take care of this
one, you go on home.

00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,933
(sinister music)

00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,193
(keys clanging)

00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,792
(grunts)

00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,425
You're a dead man
anyway, Walker.

00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,388
You're just too damn
dumb to know it.

00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:47,269
(clacks tongue)

00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,914
Hey, drop me off here, will you?

00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,666
(birds chirping)

00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,382
(engine rumbling)

00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:22,012
(woman chattering)

00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,433
That was dumb.

00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,519
Keep it simple, stupid.

00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,464
- Yeah.

00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:12,271
- I need to talk to
somebody in security.

00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,484
Do you speak English?

00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,116
Take me to the
director of security.

00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,121
KGB.

00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,457
- Follow me.

00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,398
- Why did you come here?

00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,358
- I'm...

00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,278
An American naval officer.

00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,530
- And why did you come here?

00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,452
- I'm interested in selling

00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:12,497
classified United States
documents to the Soviet Union.

00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,298
I want to sell top secrets.

00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,009
Valuable military information.

00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,388
I brought along a sample.

00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,645
This is a current key
list of the KL-47.

00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:43,403
If you know anything,
you know what that is.

00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,322
- Wait here, please.

00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,729
- Why isn't this signed?

00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,648
All K lists must be signed.

00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,358
This is worthless.

00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,363
- It's just a routine slip.

00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,489
It doesn't mean anything.

00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,282
Half of them are never signed.

00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,700
We have too many
to sign them all.

00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,828
We only sign the top one.

00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,123
- I must know your name.

00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,582
- My name's James.

00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,920
James Harper like the whisky.

00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:45,382
- I must see some
official identification.

00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:49,010
- Why is this necessary?

00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,345
It's a straight business deal.

00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,972
You want it or not?

00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:55,308
- Please do not worry, we
will protect your identity.

00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,102
We desire this document
you have brought us.

00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,396
We want more such documents.

00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,690
We welcome you, dear friend.

00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:05,485
So please, let me have
your identification.

00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,377
Thank you, Mr. Harper.

00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,132
Please have a seat.

00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,342
Please, please, sit down.

00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,387
- Look, uh.

00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,306
Can't we hurry this up?

00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,474
I gotta get back to the base.

00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:36,766
- Please sit down.

00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,019
It is necessary that
we proceed slowly.

00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,812
- Like hell it is.

00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,564
I got the midnight watch.

00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:43,857
I can't be late without calling.

00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,484
I got a long drive
back to Norfolk.

00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,486
I want to talk about the
money right now or I walk.

00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:51,364
- That wouldn't be
wise, Mr. Harper.

00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,073
(speaks foreign language)

00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:55,452
- We are making arrangements
for your secure departure.

00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,953
I'm sorry it has taken so long,

00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,414
but there are many
precautions one must take.

00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,499
Please, sit.

00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,338
Now is your coming
here politically

00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,507
or financially motivated?

00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:13,720
- It's purely financial,
I need the money.

00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,597
- $1,000 in $50 bills.

00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,149
- Where are we going?

00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,025
- Shh.

00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,951
Your coat and your hat, please.

00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,729
- Hi, Miss Walker.

00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,108
- Oh my gosh, it's so big!

00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,985
- I know.
- So shiny.

00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,861
(children chattering)

00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:12,737
- Hi!

00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,157
- So what do you think?

00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,582
(sighs)

00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:26,835
You like it?

00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:27,919
- Oh my god.

00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,129
Oh my god.

00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,840
- Come on, it's great.
- Look at this.

00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,217
(giggling)

00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,431
- Nice, huh?

00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,480
- [Girl] Oh my god!

00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:49,065
- Oh, don't go out
there, it's not safe!

00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:52,694
- It's all right, it's
got a safety rail.

00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:56,281
Come on, let me show
you the kitchen.

00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,616
The rugrats can eat over here.

00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,534
(children chattering)

00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:00,785
- [Girl] Look at this room!

00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:01,786
- Our furniture's gonna
be terrible in here.

00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,330
It's so beat up looking.

00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:06,875
- Well we'll just get
all new stuff, huh?

00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,461
I'll wait on you to get here,
give you something to do.

00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,713
- This kitchen is huge!

00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,382
- Yeah, so now you can do all
that fancy Italian cooking

00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,259
you've been bragging about.

00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,219
Whatever it takes, uh,

00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,013
here's 1,000 to get you started.

00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,932
I want you to fix this place
up any way you want it.

00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,518
Get yourself and the kids
dressed up too, okay?

00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,647
It's not enough, you
just ask for more.

00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,815
- This is much more than
your moving allowance.

00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,609
How can we afford this?

00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,402
- Don't worry about it.

00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,864
I got a great deal
on this place and...

00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,115
I got a second job.

00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,201
I'm gonna be making
some extra cash,

00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,535
running cars from
here up to Washington

00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:43,745
for a rental agency.

00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,413
It's all under the
table, there's no taxes,

00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,499
so don't say
anything to anybody,

00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,417
not even the kids, okay?

00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,920
- Are you sure it's okay?

00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:55,465
- Barbara, don't start
raining on the picnic.

00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,591
Come on.

00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,972
(children giggling)

00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:06,101
You get these rugrats
under control.

00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,687
We got to start teaching
this kids some manners.

00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:11,314
- Let's ride the
elevator again, Daddy.

00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,400
- He's into it already,
aren't you, kid?

00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,528
Come on, let me show
you to your room.

00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,988
You're too old to be sleeping
with the bitches now.

00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,864
Come on.

00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,748
(chattering)

00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,633
- Hello, my dear friend.

00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,094
Do you enjoy the view?

00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,929
How was the trip from Norfolk?

00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,889
Was there much rain?

00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,599
- Nothing unusual.

00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,810
- Have you seen any
cars more than once?

00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,437
Think carefully.

00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:53,606
- No, I wasn't followed,
I doubled back five times.

00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,692
- Did you bring
a package for me?

00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,986
Did you follow
the shopping list?

00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:58,862
- Yes.

00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,489
It's in the shopping bag.

00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,366
- First give it to me.

00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,662
I have an envelope for you.

00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,208
We agreed to a monthly salary,

00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,294
$4,000 a month as
long as you continue

00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,755
to obtain the KL-47 key lists.

00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:22,010
In addition, you will be paid
extra for all specific items.

00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:24,304
You will never receive
less than $2,000 a month

00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:28,892
as long as you have access to
crypto material of any sort.

00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:29,768
- Okay.

00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,521
What do I have to do to earn
the extra above the 4,000?

00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,399
What specific items
you interested in?

00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,443
- Not too fast.

00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,780
Let's first talk a little
about security, my friend.

00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:46,409
I urge you to invest this
money wisely and quietly,

00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:50,622
not spend it lavishly on
expensive cars and clothes.

00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,832
An American family sedan
is an excellent car

00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,502
and quiet the nerves of the FBI.

00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,339
- I've got all the
car I need right now.

00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,382
Look, don't worry about me.

00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:02,425
I've got a little
business on the side.

00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,177
I can cover this money easy.

00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,512
- And your wife?

00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:08,056
Is she a reliable woman?

00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,850
It's quite possible she
may become suspicious.

00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,478
Is she a loyal partner
to you and your marriage?

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,232
- My wife does what
I tell her to do.

00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,316
Come on, let's get
down to business.

00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,859
I got a long drive
back to Norfolk.

00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,028
Let's go down your list.

00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,198
- We are very
interested in the KW-70

00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,285
absolute cryptographic system.

00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:33,331
We will pay bonuses
on any key lists

00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,543
and technical
manuals on this item.

00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,380
- What kind of bonuses?

00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,798
- $1,000 extra.

00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,593
If you can get a complete
month's set of key lists

00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:48,888
within two weeks
before the next drop.

00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,432
- Oh.

00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,477
That could be difficult.

00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,689
But I'll tell you.

00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:03,486
If I get 100%, I want
double, 8,000 a month.

00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,154
- Agreed, my friend.

00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,368
It's too dangerous to
meet again face to face.

00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,828
We will not meet
for a long time,

00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,039
but we will become
great friends.

00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:19,210
We will write each other
letters in the drop packages.

00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,504
This is a miniature Rota reader.

00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,507
Memorize the instructions,
then destroy them.

00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:28,553
It will enable you to read the
circuit boards in the KL-47.

00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,391
Let no one see this device.

00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,101
Anyone with crypto clearance

00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:39,063
will recognize this instantly
as decryption equipment.

00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,232
- Just don't worry about it.

00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,359
- If there's any emergency and
you want to see me at once,

00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:47,280
the instructions will tell
you how to arrange a meeting.

00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,407
- Wait, wait a minute.

00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:51,367
Uh...

00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,331
What about the pill?

00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,333
- A pill, what pill?

00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:01,628
- Well aren't you gonna give
me some kind of suicide pill

00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:05,256
or something in
case I get arrested?

00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,842
- We don't do such things.

00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,510
We want you to know
we're very concerned

00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,346
about your welfare.

00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:12,931
We know the
difficulties you face.

00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,891
So many people who come to us

00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:19,354
help us for a couple of
years and then retire.

00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,856
We hope you will be one of them.

00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,399
Goodbye, my friend.

00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,744
(chuckles)

00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,912
(squeals)

00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,372
- Mom, Daddy's coming!

00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,915
- All right, um, finish
setting the table.

00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,416
Cynthia, watch Michael.

00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,417
Laura, help me get the
appetizers out of the fridge.

00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,127
Come on, let's go.

00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,673
- I'm home.

00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:47,757
- [Barbara] Hi.

00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,134
- Well hello, darling.

00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,052
(giggling)

00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,387
- Laura, bring the appetizers.

00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:52,887
- Hey, kids, hello, buddy.

00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,890
- You can serve
your dad now, honey.

00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:56,975
- Thank you, darling.

00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:57,767
Just leave the tray.

00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,727
Go find the other kids.

00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,232
Here's to you, Barb.

00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:07,151
(glasses clink)

00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,486
Mm!

00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:12,365
You make a great martini,
I'll say that for you.

00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,616
Sit down.

00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,575
Let's talk.

00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,538
(giggles)

00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:23,751
You know, I really like what
you've done with the place.

00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,503
It looks great.
- Thanks.

00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:29,340
- Kids too, they're not
rugrats anymore. (laughs)

00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,509
They're 100% improved.

00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:33,636
I think we should celebrate.

00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,887
I think we oughta have a party.

00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:37,223
Get a jump on Easter
and have a big blowout.

00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,433
What do you say?
- No, I--

00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,351
- I'll get one of
those new hi-fi systems

00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:43,146
and we can invite
all the neighbors too

00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,024
and then we can turn that sucker
up as loud as we want, huh?

00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,525
- I don't think we should be
throwing our money around,

00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,028
Johnny, we just barely moved in.

00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,238
- I told you not to
worry about the money.

00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,323
Just relax and enjoy it.

00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,453
I don't understand you.

00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:59,871
At first you complain
about no money

00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:02,957
and then you don't
want to spend it.

00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,418
Give us a taste.

00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,473
I've been thinking about
getting a little boat,

00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,683
taking up sailing.

00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:25,354
Got my eye on this 24-footer
down at the marina.

00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,355
You know...

00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,025
You should have a hobby, Barb.

00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,111
Why don't you start taking
movies of Mike and the girls.

00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,446
Here, here's 500.

00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,117
That'll get you started.

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,495
Just tell me what you need.

00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:45,374
- What I really need is
to know what's going on.

00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:49,837
All those $50 bills can't
be just from running cars.

00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,422
(laughs)

00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,924
- Hey.

00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,927
The days of powdered milk
and resale shoes are over.

00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,054
That's all you need to know.

00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,305
Here.

00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,473
I'm finished.

00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,061
- It's not exactly an answer.

00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,022
- Look.

00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,650
These guys I'm working for are
local scuzzy mafia, alright?

00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:11,984
They're trying to go legit,

00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,986
so they're working under
the table a little bit.

00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,571
It's no big deal.

00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:19,325
So the less you
know, the better.

00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:23,079
Or maybe you don't want
the family together.

00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,165
Maybe you want us
out in the street.

00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,126
Here.

00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,801
- [Barbara] All right, Johnny.

00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,387
(gloomy music)

00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,812
(tapping)

00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,773
- I'm going now, John.

00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,024
The only thing hot is this pink

00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,693
on the recent
Arctic anti-sub ops.

00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,444
Get it out of
priority distribution.

00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,113
- Right, Captain, and one thing.

00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,322
I'd like to put in a request

00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,366
for some tech manuals
on the new KW-7.

00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,326
We're just not up to date
on all the modifications.

00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:05,288
- Okay, put it on my desk.

00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,539
I'm off.

00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,332
My wife will kill me
if I miss dinner again.

00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,167
It's PTA night.

00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,335
(laughs)

00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,631
- Hey, Sampson.

00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,634
Run this through the other
KL-47 for me, will you?

00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,970
Make photocopies of
all this raw data here

00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,222
so we calm ourselves.

00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,307
I think this one's
garbling again.

00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,474
Something's wrong with it.

00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,851
- [Sampson] Why me, chief?

00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,477
I got all these
pinks to get out.

00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,189
- Oh and I got my
eye on you, Sampson.

00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,523
You're the one of
these tape apes

00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,484
who can talk and scratch
himself at the same time.

00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,737
I'm gonna make a hot
runner out of you.

00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,238
You're gonna be
chief and thanking me

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,532
before you know it, buddy.

00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,286
- Skipper's a hot run, ain't he?

00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,830
Guy can transmit faster
than he can talk.

00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,498
That's somethin'.

00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,377
- Yeah, well let me know if
they ever decipher his bull.

00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,552
(sinister music)

00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,525
(beeping)

00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:08,888
- Trash bag.

00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:12,641
Documents drop.

00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,714
(whistling)

00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:27,174
- Barbara, come
in here a minute.

00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:29,927
Barbara!

00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,763
Where the hell are you?

00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,019
- That's a good question.

00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,607
Working late again?

00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:44,984
- Maybe.

00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,903
- It's a funny thing
about work, isn't it?

00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,405
What'd you say your work was?

00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,489
(chuckles)

00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,283
- You tell me.

00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,326
You've obviously
been checking it out.

00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,996
- Well a wife's supposed to
care about her husband's work.

00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,331
Isn't that what you always said?

00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,459
- Some things have changed.

00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,754
- Document drops?

00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,548
Emergency procedures?

00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:10,468
They sure have.

00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:12,928
- Look.

00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,681
I'm just selling some
routine information

00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,600
to some business contractors.

00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,185
It's no big deal.

00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:23,355
- Is that why they pay
you in stack of $50 bills?

00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,440
- What do you care?

00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,524
It's just business.

00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,234
Relax, will ya?

00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,653
You got your life, I got mine.

00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:30,863
- Is that it?

00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,949
My life is separate from yours?

00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,951
Is that the way it's gonna
be from now on, Johnny?

00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,244
- You tell me.

00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,748
- What about the kids?

00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,625
What about the family?

00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,961
What about me?

00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,963
What you're doing is dangerous.

00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,673
- What am I doing?

00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:53,093
- You're stealing secrets from
work and you're selling them.

00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,428
- Give me a break.

00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,763
- You're a liar!

00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,556
You're a traitor!
- Shut up.

00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,434
Somebody might hear you
and take you seriously.

00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,520
- You're a spy for the Russians!

00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,271
You're a spy!

00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,648
Traitor, Johnny Walker!

00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,942
(screams)

00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,363
(gloomy music)

00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,295
- Barbara.

00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,592
I'm sorry.

00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,474
We were snowed under with debts.

00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,976
We woulda lost everything.

00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,727
We put it in the bar.

00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:47,773
I just grabbed the first thing
that I could to bail us out.

00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,359
I could have left, I could
have just walked away from you.

00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:54,071
That would have been
easier, but I didn't.

00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,324
I stayed and I got it
together here for all of us

00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:01,370
because I want this
family to stay together.

00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,497
Are you listening to me?

00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,499
How can you say that
I don't care about you

00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,167
when I'm doing all of this

00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:10,379
so that you and I can have the
kind of life that we deserve?

00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,132
- They're gonna
send you to jail.

00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,302
- Look, I'm just doing it

00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:19,054
till we can get
back on our feet.

00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,307
We'll get us a little
house by the ocean,

00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,224
nice school for the kids.

00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,059
That's all we need, right?

00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,811
And that'll be the end of it.

00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,313
It's just paper.

00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,857
That's all it is.

00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,319
I mean, they call it a secret,

00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,155
but thousands of people see it.

00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,033
It's just a game.

00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,702
People buy it, people sell it,

00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:44,580
but it doesn't make a
damn bit of difference.

00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,582
All that matters is us.

00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,460
It's not easy for me.

00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,590
I'm scared.

00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:01,305
But I can't just stop.

00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,516
That's why I haven't
made love to you

00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:07,436
and that's why I
haven't been home.

00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,188
- Why didn't you tell me?

00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,357
- I didn't want to scare you.

00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:13,150
Sometimes at night

00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:16,070
I just watched you
while you were sleeping.

00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,656
It's the only thing that
kept me from going crazy.

00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:21,033
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not.

00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,911
I love you, I've
always loved you.

00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,836
But you gotta know that if uh...

00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:37,299
If they catch me,
I'm a dead man.

00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:39,802
If it happens, I...

00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,346
I'd just like for
you to take the kids

00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,264
and go up to Maine,
stay with your sister.

00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:47,518
- I couldn't stand
it if you got caught.

00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:53,482
- Honey, I gotta make one
more delivery and that's it.

00:44:57,194 --> 00:45:01,073
We're gonna transfer to the
West Coast or something,

00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,033
just put it all behind us.

00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:05,119
(moans)

00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:07,913
Don't leave me.

00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:18,924
Help me.

00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,099
- Depth steady at 60
feet, surface secure.

00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,309
ESM and UHF Mast deploy, sir.

00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:31,145
- All ready with a
Zulu flash, Davis.

00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:32,521
Cue to transmit, sir.

00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,814
- Transmit.
- Transmit.

00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,107
- Skipper, we have
a submerged contact

00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,402
on our port valve on
2,000 yards and closing.

00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:40,571
He sounds like an
Ivan Alpha Class.

00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:41,655
- Prepare to dive.

00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,782
Make your depth 1,000 feet.

00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,075
Right standard runner.

00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,118
- Prepare to dive.

00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,035
(buzzing)

00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,746
- ESM and UHF Mast lowered.

00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:51,498
All secured for dive, sir.

00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,374
- Dive.

00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,210
- [Man] 50 degrees angle
down on the planes.

00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,754
All ahead full dive.

00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,756
- Make your depth 1,000
feet and balanced out.

00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,382
- Skipper, he's
going down with us.

00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,675
- [Man] What?

00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:02,426
- [Man] He's sitting in
our right coordinates.

00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,927
He's almost ahead of us.

00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,596
- That's impossible.

00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,433
Definitely a
simulated attack, sir.

00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,351
I think he knew
exactly where and when

00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:14,521
our transmissions
were to take place.

00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:17,608
He was waiting for
us right on position

00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:21,987
and I think he knew our
standard evasive tactics.

00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:25,449
He followed us right down
through the front and behind.

00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,825
- What are the numbers, Harry?

00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,035
The raw data?

00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,747
- 56 encounters with
Russian submarines

00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,416
and 50 spotted in the
last survey period.

00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,460
318 in this survey period.

00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,087
That's an increase of uh--

00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,799
- That's a damn increase in
the size of our underwear

00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,468
if Ivan can get his subs
into our pants like this.

00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,053
Any Soviet technical advance

00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,305
would have to be extremely
complex to cover this.

00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,057
I don't think it's a
technical advantage.

00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:51,225
I think they're getting
their information

00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,935
from somewhere else.

00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,103
Anybody want to
argue this with me?

00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:55,979
- I do.

00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,024
There is one area where a
single technical advance

00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,400
could give the
Soviets an advantage

00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:02,528
in all areas all at once.

00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:04,363
That's codes and decryption.

00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,114
- If they've got the
advantage on us there,

00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:09,326
they won't tip their hand
unless we surprise them.

00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,411
We need a kind of
countermeasure we can undertake

00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,163
to prove Ivan's
reading our codes.

00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:16,083
(upbeat band music)

00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,042
- [Man] I gotta go.

00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,961
(chattering)

00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,922
(ship horn blares)

00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:24,591
- Smile, will ya?

00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,927
You look good when you smile.

00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,512
- Don't much feel like smiling.

00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,430
- Hey, listen to me.

00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,850
I got free of all that stuff.

00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:35,227
I told you I'm clean.

00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:38,981
I'm lily white, just another
sailor doing his job.

00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,316
- Why do I feel so nervous?

00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,194
- 'Cause you know you've got
to go fix up our new house.

00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,571
You gotta make it beautiful,
get kids to school

00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:48,448
and live the
California life, hmm?

00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,749
- [Barbara] Hey.

00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:07,718
- Keep the home
fires burning, baby.

00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:23,567
(ship horn blares)

00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:24,443
- Kay!

00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,699
Kay, honey.

00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,201
- How'd you find out?

00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:36,038
- I was just seeing
Johnny off, what happened?

00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,581
- Jimmy was killed in Vietnam.

00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:40,709
We're, we're taking
him home now.

00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,503
(solemn music)

00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,473
(rumbling)

00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:59,770
- As the death toll is
climbing near to it,

00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:03,440
90 kilometers west
of reaching 75

00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,025
for a total of 152.

00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,570
The offensive, which began as
a search and destroy mission

00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:12,574
of the 173rd airborne
division continues to battle.

00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,577
(birds chirping)

00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,552
(banging)

00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,556
(gloomy music)

00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:38,910
- Liar.

00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,414
Liar, Johnny.

00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:53,467
(sinister music)

00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:14,488
(fire crackling)

00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:31,421
(sighs)

00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:35,509
(sobs)

00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,140
(upbeat band music)

00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,768
- [Man] Liberty
uniform, rest white.

00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:49,356
- Get ready to open your bags.

00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:51,399
Get all that port out of
there, I'm not kidding.

00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,193
- Just the briefcase.

00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:57,405
- I have permission
to come ashore, sir.

00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:58,782
- Hi, Mr. Walker.

00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,996
- I didn't know you were
a smoker, Mr. Walker.

00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:06,957
- Well, I like one afterwards,

00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:09,167
if you know what I mean, sir.

00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,335
- Well you have a good one.

00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:13,338
- I certainly
intend to try, sir.

00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,374
Hello, babe.

00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:51,877
I'm home.

00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,463
What's that you got
in your hand, Barb?

00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,632
You gonna shoot somebody?

00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:02,596
Your husband maybe
just back from Vietnam.

00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:07,601
Don't let the booze
make you reckless.

00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:12,022
I see you had your day
with all the money.

00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,274
What in the hell
did you do with it?

00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,651
You couldn't have drank that
much, you'd be dead by now.

00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,320
- I want a divorce.

00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:21,364
- Well that's a
nice welcome home.

00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:23,158
How 'bout a kiss too?

00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,040
- I know you're still spying.

00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,418
I can't stand it anymore.

00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,672
I don't need you anymore.

00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,926
I got a job.

00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:41,801
- A job?

00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,598
You're just a piece of thirst.

00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,933
Who gave you a job?

00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:50,227
- I'm working as a
cashier in a restaurant.

00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:51,770
- Great.

00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:53,855
That's about your speed.

00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:58,485
How do you make it
through the day?

00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:00,070
I mean look at you.

00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:02,280
Your hand's shaking 'cause
you want a drink so bad.

00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:05,408
- You made me what
I am, you bastard.

00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,035
- All right then.

00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:09,120
Go ahead.

00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,456
Pull the trigger.

00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,292
Go ahead, shoot me.

00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:15,168
Shoot me!

00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:19,089
(gun fires)

00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:21,466
You want to learn how to shoot?

00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:22,259
I'll teach ya!

00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,220
(gun fires)

00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,390
- [Girl] Come on, run, hurry!

00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:28,932
- There won't be
anybody saying anything

00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:32,394
about spying to anyone,
will there, huh?

00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,937
Huh?
(gun fires)

00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:34,854
- No.

00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:35,772
- They're trying to kill us.

00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:38,275
We gotta get out of here.

00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:40,485
- I'm not going.

00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,278
I'm not going.

00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:42,988
(gun fires)

00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,948
(sobs)

00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:54,958
- I think you need a
drink, don't you, babe?

00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,335
(whimpers)

00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,343
You can hardly wait, can you?

00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:08,388
Just hear this.

00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,057
No divorce.

00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:17,063
It's not good for my
security clearance.

00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,732
Now let's go to bed.

00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:22,861
We'll have a little
homecoming party.

00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,070
Here's to it.

00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:32,412
(chuckles)

00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:36,291
I brought you a little
present from Hong Kong.

00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:55,352
(ship horn blares)

00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:58,355
Women in the Navy will never
serve on ships during combat.

00:55:58,396 --> 00:55:59,481
That's the bottom line.

00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:01,316
Go into advanced communications.

00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:05,570
You already got clearance now
to classified material, right?

00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,989
Afternoon, Admiral Murnett!

00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,242
You want to go
party tonight, huh?

00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:12,994
- Who was that clown, Admiral?

00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,788
- That's Johnny Walker.

00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:16,331
Thought the Navy would
have been smart enough

00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,793
to retire him by now
or court marshal him.

00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:23,505
He worked for me on the Jones.

00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,881
I tell you, on a 90-day
underwater cruise,

00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:27,300
you gotta have a
joker like Walker.

00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:28,676
He says all the things
behind your back

00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,887
that the men want to say.

00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:34,474
He's an ongoing
low-grade verbal mutiny.

00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:37,268
I used to call him
the great ventilator.

00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:40,313
- I'm not sure we need a
Navy full of jokers, sir.

00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,357
- By the book all the way.

00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,317
I think I hear an Aplas
talking there, Sam.

00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,611
- That's affirmative, sir.

00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,368
- We're calling it code
name Scorpion, Ben.

00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:56,454
- Scorpion, yeah, seems like
an appropriate name to me, sir.

00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:59,249
- If the Russians run when we
stage the nuclear accident,

00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,751
we'll know for sure
they've cracked our codes.

00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:03,128
- I hope we're wrong, sir.

00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:04,546
- So do I, Ben.

00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:09,300
- Sir.

00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:13,054
That personnel
file you requested

00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:13,805
is from Walker, John A. CW03.

00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:18,560
It doesn't register with the
records so I put a trace on it.

00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,853
- Something about this Walker

00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:22,814
always seems to
ring a little off.

00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:25,442
How about his, uh, clearance?

00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:29,571
- Here's the security
clearance update roster, sir.

00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:34,117
Mr. Walker's clearance
is due for renewal, sir.

00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,368
- Let's get the paperwork in

00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,537
for his background
security check.

00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,956
Send a copy over to staff
in Talleham's office.

00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:43,543
I'd like to know his
efficiency rating.

00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:46,504
- [Man] Reactor scram, reactor
scram, prepare to surface.

00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:47,046
- Nuclear accident report.

00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:51,050
Z Flash to Hannibal
for immediate aid.

00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:52,844
- Sir, the nuclear
accident report

00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,304
has been received
on the Hannibal.

00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:57,056
- Now we'll see how good
a fisherman Burnett is.

00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:58,308
- [Man] They have the reactors.

00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,100
Cut the engines.

00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,185
Z Flash SOS.

00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:04,314
(speaking foreign language)

00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:07,317
- In this there reports a
surge in roosky radio activity.

00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:11,321
(speaking in foreign language)

00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:14,991
- [Man] They're moving
some of the alphas down now

00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,326
to check out the
radiation levels.

00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:18,495
- Sir, the Sorbitral
has changed course

00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:20,788
to intersect with the Hannibal.

00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:24,167
- Well, boys, looks like
we've got our answer.

00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:26,461
Ivan isn't reading our minds.

00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,130
He's reading our mail.

00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,715
(bubbling)

00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,926
- The security in
this place stinks.

00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:34,260
I mean it doesn't even
come up to the quality

00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:37,430
of the security in
a convenience store.

00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,600
They throw these bags around

00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:44,103
so that half the seals on
the code packs are broken.

00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:45,355
There, patch these up with tape

00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:46,606
before you distribute
them, honey,

00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:50,443
otherwise Skipper's
gonna have a hemorrhage.

00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:07,585
So, Edith, who's the new
girl with all the tears?

00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:08,711
- She's the admiral's yeoman.

00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:11,005
She just left her husband.

00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,425
Forget it, John,
she's not your type.

00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:16,469
She thinks with her brain,
she doesn't sit on them.

00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:18,221
- Huh, well maybe we can
help her out with that.

00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:19,222
Why don't you fix me
up on a little date?

00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,598
- No way.

00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,933
Oh incidentally,

00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,560
somebody up above must
have caught your act.

00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:24,936
They flagged your file.

00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,105
You must be up for some
hot new assignment.

00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,314
I couldn't find your file.

00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:29,732
It's probably up in payroll.

00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:31,568
Oh, oh, I forgot to tell you.

00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:34,654
They want your
clearance up to date.

00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:37,532
- Hey, here she comes.

00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:39,075
Do your thing.

00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:41,035
How about tonight, huh?

00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:46,457
- Why don't you just
think of him as a loner?

00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:47,750
Just the right guy for awhile

00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:50,461
till you get your own
little red wagon fixed.

00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:52,297
Hey, Johnny, there you are.

00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:54,841
Take two and call
me in the morning.

00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:55,800
- Hi, ladies.

00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:56,676
- Hi.

00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,053
- Give me a double with
my name on it, Joe,

00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:00,346
and pour them again
for these ladies.

01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:02,223
- Oh no, not for me,
I've got to get home.

01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:02,890
- Home?

01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,393
That's where you go when
you got nothing else to do.

01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,769
- Or if you feel a
headache coming on.

01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:08,521
I will see you guys later.

01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:09,772
- Edith, don't do this to me.

01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:11,274
- It'll be fine.

01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:13,359
Bye.

01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,364
- Take care of that
headache, Edith.

01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:31,544
So.

01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:39,802
Edith tells me you've been
having a real rough time.

01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:41,304
- Yeah, I guess.

01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:51,147
(siren blaring)

01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:07,330
(guns firing)

01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:09,624
(yelling)

01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:59,340
- You're gonna get me my
file, aren't you, sweetheart?

01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,260
Welcome aboard the
USS Johnny Walker.

01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:05,012
(sinister music)

01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:59,525
(clicking)

01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:01,277
We're in business.

01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:01,861
Hey, Jerry.

01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:04,655
Our Navy cruises are
never like this, huh?

01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:05,990
(laughs)

01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:10,286
Hey, did you see that
movie, uh, Easy Rider?

01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:10,995
- Oh yeah.

01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:14,999
- That guy, uh, Jack Nicholson,
the straight lawyer guy.

01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:17,001
(laughs)

01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:20,797
- Do you remember when he gets
stoned for the first time?

01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:22,673
Man, that was the best
part of that movie.

01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:24,509
- No, no.

01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,677
The best part was they
cut a straight guy

01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:29,096
in on a crooked deal
and he jumped at it.

01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:30,306
That's the best
part, he goes for it.

01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:31,432
I mean think about it.

01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,309
Put yourself in his place.

01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:35,186
You hear the deal and you think

01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:38,439
hey, would I go for
something like that?

01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:42,777
I mean, that's the point
of the whole movie.

01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:45,780
Guys like us, would we go for it

01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,115
if they laid one on
us out of the blue?

01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:49,951
- One time score?

01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:52,370
Sure, I'd be up for
that in a minute

01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:54,539
and I know what to do with
the money too, believe me,

01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:58,209
not like those
dudes in the movie.

01:03:58,251 --> 01:03:59,377
- Yeah, well...

01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:03,506
I got a one shot deal for you.

01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:05,842
Listen close.

01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,470
I'm only gonna say this once

01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:12,098
and if you don't go for
it, you just say so.

01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:15,476
We won't ever talk
about it again ever.

01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:19,313
All good things are simple.

01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,899
Classified information is money.

01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:22,775
That's it.

01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:25,236
If you don't take
advantage of it,

01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:28,155
you're just throwing
all that money away.

01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:29,699
- Throwing it away?

01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,576
What do you mean?

01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:34,120
- Classified information is
valuable to one of our allies.

01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:34,871
It's like that guy
Nicholson in the movie.

01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:39,500
It's not exactly legal, but
doesn't damage our security any

01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,794
if this ally gets it.

01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,713
Makes it safer probably.

01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:47,341
Cuts out the chances
of the mistakes.

01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:48,676
- What ally?

01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:51,679
- Well I got this
contact in Europe.

01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,472
Buyer wants to know our
strategic intentions

01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:56,225
and sometimes it's
just not polite to ask

01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:58,728
even if you are one
of our best allies.

01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:02,398
But my contact tells
me Israel is the buyer.

01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:07,403
- Israel.

01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:11,407
I wouldn't even think of that.

01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:15,703
Listen, John, tell
me more about this.

01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,873
See, I'm working on all the
latest high-tech hardware,

01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:23,294
but I think the Israelis
can handle it, you know?

01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:26,464
(seagull cawing)

01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:29,383
(phone ringing)

01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:30,384
(knocking)

01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:31,177
- [Sam] Come in.

01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:32,428
- Sir.

01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:33,971
I got a call from
intelligence section, sir,

01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,681
that security investigation
you were looking into,

01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:37,350
Walker, John. A, Junior.

01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:38,351
- Thanks, Trudy.

01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:39,435
What'd they turn up?

01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:40,770
- They didn't, sir.

01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:42,355
They have no record
of any recent update

01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:44,065
in Mr. Walker's clearance.

01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,066
- Well according to
this his clearance

01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:47,026
was in April this year.

01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:50,029
Must be some mistake.

01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:52,281
This isn't the pink copy.

01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:54,492
They usually send the pink
copy from NIS, don't they?

01:05:54,533 --> 01:05:57,411
- I believe so, yes, sir.

01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:58,663
- Schedule Walker.

01:05:58,704 --> 01:06:01,332
I want to see him ASAP.

01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:03,042
(moans)

01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:04,460
- Yeah, that's it.

01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:06,879
Oh, you've got great hands.

01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,093
Oh, I'm all out.

01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:13,010
Go get me another one out
of the freezer, beautiful,

01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:15,513
and put another one in there.

01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:18,265
Double time!

01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:20,518
- It's my turn now.

01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:22,770
- Oh yeah, what did you
learn today, sailor?

01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,939
Tell me something new,
something I don't know.

01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,357
- I can sing.

01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,985
- Oh, what can you sing, huh?

01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:33,322
How about the Star
Spangled Banner?

01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:34,657
- That's corny.

01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:35,574
- What's the
matter, you too good

01:06:35,616 --> 01:06:37,326
to sing our national anthem?

01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:38,661
Come on, sing it.

01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:38,471
- Captain Lennox will
see you now, Mr. Walker.

01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:50,441
- Chief Warrant Officer
Johnny Walker, Jr.

01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,735
reporting as ordered, sir.

01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:01,994
Chief Warrant Officer
Walker, John A., Jr.

01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:04,789
reporting as ordered, sir.

01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:07,291
- Stand at ease, Mr. Walker.

01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:13,547
Seems to be some discrepancy
in your security clearance.

01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:15,382
There's no record of
your recent clearance

01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:17,259
in the intelligence section.

01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:19,970
Your file's just photocopied.

01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:23,474
We're trying to trace
the original with NIS.

01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:25,893
- You know the Navy, sir.

01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:27,269
It could be anywhere.

01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:27,853
I wouldn't worry about it.

01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:31,565
In fact, if I were you
I'd just ignore it.

01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:32,650
- Ignore it?

01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:38,030
You better start worrying
about it, mister,

01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:39,824
'cause I'm going to get
to the bottom of it.

01:08:39,865 --> 01:08:44,453
- Well, I doubt that it'll
make much difference, sir.

01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:48,457
See, this is my request
for 20-year retirement.

01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:51,502
It's all approved and in order.

01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:54,338
The medical clearance is
attached, as you can see.

01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,465
With my cumulated leave time,

01:08:56,507 --> 01:09:00,511
I'll be retiring from active
duty at the end of this month.

01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:09,895
- That'll be all, Mr. Walker.

01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:11,522
- Thank you, sir.

01:09:20,447 --> 01:09:21,866
You want a divorce?

01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:24,410
Okay, I'll give you a divorce.

01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:25,619
I'm not only divorcing you,

01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:28,122
I'm divorcing all
your damn brats too!

01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:29,915
(shattering)

01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:31,834
Just take them all,
go up to Maine,

01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:34,211
that's a good place for you!

01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:35,588
I don't want any
visitation rights.

01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:36,380
Take them out!

01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:38,382
Go to Maine!

01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:40,843
You like it up there, don't you?

01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:43,387
You want to do your
own thing, bitch?

01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:44,430
You do it!

01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:46,599
Just stay out of my life.

01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,059
Until you can get
yourself together enough

01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:52,021
to get out of here,
I'm moving out.

01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:55,316
I can't stand your face anymore.

01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:57,610
So you stay out of my way.

01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,613
(banging)

01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:20,507
Michael, front and center!

01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:23,594
(crickets chirping)

01:10:38,817 --> 01:10:39,652
Stop that.

01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:42,738
Tears are for bitches.

01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:48,160
- I don't want you to go.

01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:50,329
- I'm gonna tell
you a secret, okay?

01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:52,831
You gotta promise not to
tell the bitches, right?

01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:54,500
Right?
- Right, Dad.

01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,254
- I'm gonna give you my
private phone number.

01:10:58,295 --> 01:11:02,508
You call me any time you want
collect, whenever you want.

01:11:02,549 --> 01:11:04,093
Are you ready to receive?

01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:06,053
- I got nothing
to write it down.

01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:09,306
- Right hell, you
remember it, sailor.

01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:09,890
You're not gonna get in the Navy

01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:13,018
if you can't remember
a seven-digit number.

01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:14,311
It's 555-6423.

01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:17,982
- I'm not coming with you.

01:11:18,023 --> 01:11:19,441
I'm not going to Maine.

01:11:19,483 --> 01:11:20,985
I'll go live with Dad.

01:11:21,026 --> 01:11:22,278
- Just a minute, Laura.
- Leave me alone!

01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:25,906
- Don't you fight me!
- Stop it, stop it!

01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:28,575
- In case the phones are tapped,

01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:32,496
we better have code names.

01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:34,415
I'll be Tiger Breath.

01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:35,916
You be Wild Man.

01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:38,877
You got that, sailor?

01:11:38,919 --> 01:11:41,463
- Right, Dad, I
mean, Tiger Breath.

01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:43,799
- Take charge, Wild Man.

01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:45,384
I'll talk to you.

01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:53,434
Hey, don't let the
bitches get you down.

01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:54,226
What's that number?

01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:55,519
Repeat transmission.

01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:56,520
- 555-6423.

01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:01,817
- You got it, Wild Man.

01:12:05,946 --> 01:12:07,489
Talk to you soon.

01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:12,244
(engine rumbles)

01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:21,420
(gloomy music)

01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:02,419
(jack hammer rumbling)

01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:07,257
(phone ringing)

01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:08,133
Yes?

01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:12,054
What, I can't hear you.

01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:14,306
This is JH.

01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:15,474
- You're very disturbed,

01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:18,435
your sudden retirement
from the Navy.

01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:20,479
This is a serious change.

01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:22,272
What you have done
is very serious

01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:23,857
and very dangerous
for both of us.

01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,984
My superiors are very worried.

01:13:26,026 --> 01:13:27,653
You should have
consulted me in advance.

01:13:27,694 --> 01:13:29,655
- It wasn't time.

01:13:29,696 --> 01:13:31,990
Look, I've got some
great souvenirs for you.

01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:34,993
- You will be sent
a Vienna procedure.

01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:37,329
Follow the instructions exactly.

01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:39,206
Come immediately.

01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:40,416
We must talk.

01:13:44,461 --> 01:13:48,465
(birds chirping)
(gentle music)

01:13:57,057 --> 01:14:01,103
(speaking foreign language)

01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:01,895
(engine rumbling)

01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:04,481
(gloomy music)

01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:21,707
(people chattering)

01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:32,718
(sinister music)

01:14:47,399 --> 01:14:50,694
My dear friend, I
greet you at last.

01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:53,864
- Listen, uh, somebody
was following me.

01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:57,284
I checked out of the
hotel you booked me into.

01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:58,619
If you're looking for me,

01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:00,496
I'm at the Intercontinental
from now on.

01:15:00,537 --> 01:15:03,332
- Let's exchange cameras first.

01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:13,467
My superiors are not very
happy with what you have done.

01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,802
Leaving the Navy service
without consulting us first

01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:17,137
was a serious mistake.

01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:19,598
The access to key list
has been interrupted.

01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:21,099
- Oh, no.

01:15:21,141 --> 01:15:23,352
This guy I got is
mister key list.

01:15:23,393 --> 01:15:25,938
You're gonna love the stuff
he's gonna get for you.

01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:27,314
Jerry's a real asset.

01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:30,150
- Walker, we are
very serious people.

01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,444
We do not believe in suddenly
changing a known source

01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:35,405
for an unknown one
just like that.

01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:38,951
Do you understand the
difficulty you're in?

01:15:38,992 --> 01:15:41,411
I think your security
precautions were
not very successful.

01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:43,622
You had a three-year assignment.

01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:45,707
All Navy postings
are for three years.

01:15:45,749 --> 01:15:47,751
Why was this change?

01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:49,586
The FBI suspect your activities?

01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:51,004
- Oh, no way.

01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:53,131
- Then why did you
retire so suddenly?

01:15:53,173 --> 01:15:55,676
- Look, I was gonna have to
pull another tour at sea duty.

01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:56,760
I've been in there 20 years.

01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:58,303
I just wanted out.

01:15:58,345 --> 01:16:01,557
- Out is a very
dangerous place, John.

01:16:01,598 --> 01:16:04,351
People can get hurt walking
out without permission.

01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:07,145
You're not the only
one at risk here, John.

01:16:07,187 --> 01:16:09,982
The price could be very
painful for both of us.

01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:12,401
How do you know this Jerry's
a counter intelligence?

01:16:12,442 --> 01:16:13,610
- Jerry?

01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:15,612
You gotta be kidding.

01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:19,199
Jerry's not smart enough
for counter intelligence.

01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:21,243
Hey look, he's an old
time buddy of mine.

01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:22,703
I've invested a lot
of time in Jerry.

01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:23,579
I know what I'm doing.

01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:25,289
This is a perfect setup.

01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:28,208
- Recruiting is a
tricky proposition.

01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:28,792
The chance of exposure increases

01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:32,796
every time someone is
added to the circle.

01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:34,590
I want to meet this Jerry.

01:16:34,631 --> 01:16:35,882
You have to set us up.

01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:37,050
- No.

01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:38,385
No way.

01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:39,177
He'll never go for that.

01:16:39,219 --> 01:16:40,721
Now get that straight.

01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:43,015
Look, without me,
Jerry's a cockroach.

01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:44,558
He doesn't even know you exist.

01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,435
He'd disappear back
in the woodwork.

01:16:46,476 --> 01:16:48,270
- And what if anything
should happen?

01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:49,813
What if you should be
detained for whatever reason

01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:51,064
from the next meeting?

01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:52,482
Would you send
him in your place?

01:16:52,524 --> 01:16:55,027
- Look, I'm getting
sick and tired of you

01:16:55,068 --> 01:16:57,070
second guessing me
every damn time.

01:16:57,112 --> 01:16:58,822
Just get off my back!

01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:02,576
I am freezing my
butt off out here

01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:04,453
trying to bring you back
into the real world.

01:17:04,494 --> 01:17:05,912
I don't need this.

01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:10,000
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.

01:17:13,837 --> 01:17:16,298
Do you want a coffee or not?

01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:21,428
- A coffee would be agreeable.

01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:24,097
(horn blaring)

01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:26,475
- What do you say we go for
a thank-god-it's-Friday drink

01:17:26,516 --> 01:17:28,393
at the Blue Boar Inn?

01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:30,062
I'll buy the first round.

01:17:30,103 --> 01:17:31,772
Let your husband cook
dinner for a change.

01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:33,273
- My husband always
cooks dinner.

01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:34,941
I got him trained.

01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:35,734
I'll see you there.

01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:37,944
- Okay, great, bye.

01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:38,862
Hey guys, wait.

01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:39,863
Hey, how you doing?

01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:41,782
- He likes you.

01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:44,743
All he needs is a
little encouragement.

01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:45,952
Oh and married to Roger,

01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:48,455
I might go for a
little of that myself.

01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,666
He's a good boy, Ray.

01:17:50,707 --> 01:17:53,210
- It's been so long, I
don't even know the score.

01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:55,921
Besides I gotta sit Tommy, give
Cynthia a chance to get out.

01:17:55,962 --> 01:17:59,049
- We all gotta get
out a little, hon.

01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:01,176
- See you tomorrow.

01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:02,052
Bye.

01:18:05,555 --> 01:18:08,600
(crickets chirping)

01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:21,405
- It's okay, Ma.

01:18:21,446 --> 01:18:23,073
You're looking good.

01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:26,576
(camera clicks)

01:18:27,411 --> 01:18:29,371
- What are you doing?

01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:32,499
- Just getting your
picture with Tommy.

01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,334
A grandma with her kid.

01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:36,336
Cynthia'd like that.

01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:38,004
- Where'd you get that camera?

01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:40,382
- I borrowed it from
a kid at school.

01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:42,050
Dad said if I was any good,

01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:44,386
I could help him with his
detective work this summer.

01:18:44,428 --> 01:18:45,303
- What?

01:18:45,345 --> 01:18:46,471
- Getting evidence and stuff.

01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:49,224
- No, you can't, you can't.

01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:52,519
You, we, you have to help me
paint the house this summer.

01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:55,313
- God, Ma, it's so boring here.

01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:59,317
What do you expect me to
do, go surfing in the woods?

01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:01,945
- You'll have plenty
of years to go surfing.

01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:04,489
We'll have fun
painting the house.

01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:05,949
- But I already talked to Dad.

01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:08,410
- No, you can't, that's final.

01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:10,287
I don't want to hear
another word about it.

01:19:10,328 --> 01:19:12,164
- Geeze, have a
cow, why don't you?

01:19:12,205 --> 01:19:12,956
(baby crying)

01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:13,832
- Shh.

01:19:14,624 --> 01:19:16,585
Come here, it's okay.

01:19:18,712 --> 01:19:21,298
(door slams)

01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:27,804
- Watch your collar, get them
real tight up there, okay?

01:19:30,348 --> 01:19:31,349
Hi.

01:19:31,391 --> 01:19:31,975
- Hi.

01:19:31,975 --> 01:19:35,520
- We're gonna have a run
over on this invoice.

01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:38,356
You want a little
extra, you and Mary?

01:19:38,398 --> 01:19:38,982
- Sure.
- Okay.

01:19:38,982 --> 01:19:42,444
- You get a half hour
bump if you skip dinner.

01:19:42,486 --> 01:19:45,614
- Hey, Ray, you owe
us both dinner after.

01:19:45,655 --> 01:19:46,782
- You got it.

01:19:47,866 --> 01:19:48,700
Excuse me.

01:19:51,411 --> 01:19:53,079
- I told you.

01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:54,790
- I got too much on my mind.

01:19:54,831 --> 01:19:58,293
- Okay, but I'm gonna tell
Ray you're hot to trot.

01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:00,921
- Really, what's hot to trot?

01:20:22,442 --> 01:20:23,401
- Hey, buddy.

01:20:23,443 --> 01:20:24,319
- Hey, how are you?

01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:25,904
- All right.

01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:27,405
- Whoa, bag.

01:20:27,447 --> 01:20:28,406
- It's fine, you can
stay at my house.

01:20:28,448 --> 01:20:29,783
I got the whole house to myself.

01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:33,829
- John, I got some stuff
I want to talk about.

01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:35,413
- That's it?

01:20:35,455 --> 01:20:38,041
It's barely 100
exposures in six months.

01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:38,750
Jerry, the stuff you've
been getting is great.

01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:42,379
Uh, kudexes and auto-demi
systems are what they want.

01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:43,964
- It's tough now, Johnny.

01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:45,507
Alameda is a bitch.

01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:48,176
There's no secure place
to photograph anything.

01:20:48,218 --> 01:20:50,303
I got this
by-the-book commander.

01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:54,432
He's bucking for rank,
you know what that's like.

01:20:54,474 --> 01:20:56,977
It's just too difficult
to get anything, John.

01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:58,520
It's too dangerous.

01:21:02,148 --> 01:21:04,276
I put in for early retirement,

01:21:04,317 --> 01:21:06,403
I'm getting out of
the Navy for good.

01:21:06,444 --> 01:21:08,280
That's the last of it.

01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:10,574
I'm going to college.

01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:11,908
I'm gonna be a stock broker.

01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:13,827
(chuckles)

01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:16,454
- You won't finish
college, Jerry.

01:21:16,496 --> 01:21:19,040
They're gonna make it
look like an accident.

01:21:19,082 --> 01:21:21,668
The minute you quit, you're
more valuable to them dead.

01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:23,336
(chuckles)

01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:24,880
- Come on, John.

01:21:24,921 --> 01:21:26,548
You been reading
too many spy novels.

01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:27,757
- Yeah?

01:21:27,799 --> 01:21:29,551
Here, look at this.

01:21:30,677 --> 01:21:32,262
And this and this.

01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:34,472
Go on!

01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:39,728
Stabbed him with an umbrella
on the London Bridge,

01:21:39,769 --> 01:21:42,105
left a poison pellet in his
leg, he was dead in four hours.

01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:42,981
Damn KGB.

01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:50,155
- You mean the Russians
are getting this stuff?

01:21:50,196 --> 01:21:50,822
- Yeah.

01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:53,283
- John, why didn't you tell
me it was the Russians?

01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:55,535
- I just found out myself.

01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,412
- Oh yeah, yeah right.

01:21:57,454 --> 01:21:59,497
- They set me up, Jerry.

01:21:59,539 --> 01:22:03,168
How was I to know where
this stuff was really going?

01:22:03,209 --> 01:22:05,170
- Do they know my name?

01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:11,635
- I'm afraid they...

01:22:12,802 --> 01:22:15,555
Know everything
about both of us.

01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:18,600
Hey.

01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:23,063
The good news is
the sky's the limit.

01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:27,275
How about a raise
to 6,000 a month?

01:22:27,317 --> 01:22:29,527
You can get a van,
drive it on the base,

01:22:29,569 --> 01:22:32,238
have your own personal studio.

01:22:33,823 --> 01:22:36,409
- It doesn't bother you?

01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:39,496
I mean, Russians
getting this stuff.

01:22:42,248 --> 01:22:43,541
- Well, we've always
been eavesdropping

01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:45,418
on one another, right?

01:22:46,586 --> 01:22:49,297
I mean there've
always been spies.

01:22:51,341 --> 01:22:54,386
Maybe it's better
that the two countries

01:22:54,427 --> 01:22:56,388
don't have any secrets.

01:22:57,514 --> 01:22:58,848
Maybe it's safer.

01:23:01,017 --> 01:23:01,851
Here.

01:23:05,563 --> 01:23:08,858
(people chattering)

01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:10,902
- You get whatever
school you choose

01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:15,198
and that will be your selected
career path in the Army.

01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:18,785
- I want to sign up.

01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:24,582
(moaning)

01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:39,180
(phone ringing)

01:23:39,222 --> 01:23:40,640
- Baby, the phone.

01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:46,354
- Yeah?

01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:49,774
Yes, yes.

01:23:51,818 --> 01:23:52,569
Yeah, hello.

01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:54,404
(hushes)

01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:57,866
Well sure, I'm surprised
to hear from you.

01:24:00,326 --> 01:24:01,661
No kidding.

01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:03,079
(chuckles)

01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:04,497
Well that's great.

01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:05,373
Yeah.

01:24:06,082 --> 01:24:10,754
No, I'm just proud you're
doing something with your life.

01:24:10,795 --> 01:24:12,005
Of course, dear,
I mean, it's okay,

01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:13,381
it's the best
service for a woman.

01:24:13,423 --> 01:24:14,507
Uh huh.

01:24:15,925 --> 01:24:17,886
A radio officer?

01:24:17,927 --> 01:24:19,262
Honey, that's fantastic.

01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:22,515
- Yeah, but I'm still
short three credits

01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:25,310
and I got to take a
correspondents course

01:24:25,351 --> 01:24:27,353
or I don't graduate on time.

01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:29,564
It's kind of expensive.

01:24:30,857 --> 01:24:33,485
$100 and Mom doesn't have it.

01:24:33,526 --> 01:24:35,361
- Hey, don't worry about it.

01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:37,489
I'll put a money order in
the mail in the morning

01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:41,409
and listen, you're gonna
do this with bells on.

01:24:41,451 --> 01:24:45,246
I'm proud of you, honey,
and I'll put my money on it.

01:24:45,288 --> 01:24:47,332
Hey, I'll tell you what.

01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:49,751
Why don't I fly up and get you

01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:51,002
and you can come back
here and stay with me

01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:54,089
till you have to report,
how about that, huh?

01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:54,964
Why, sure.

01:24:56,549 --> 01:24:58,218
Okay, it's a deal.

01:24:59,552 --> 01:25:00,762
You just tell your Mom.

01:25:00,804 --> 01:25:02,305
- Don't worry, I will.

01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:03,848
Yeah.

01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:07,602
Okay and I'll let you
know when I get the money.

01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:08,478
Yeah.

01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:10,897
Thanks again.

01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:12,899
Goodnight, Dad.

01:25:12,899 --> 01:25:15,026
I'm looking forward
to seeing you.

01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:17,028
- Me too, babe.

01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:17,904
Bye.

01:25:19,864 --> 01:25:21,908
- Who was that?

01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:23,201
- My daughter.

01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:29,290
- You know, I never
see you this happy.

01:25:29,332 --> 01:25:30,917
- Oh yes, you have.

01:25:42,428 --> 01:25:43,763
- Here comes Dad.

01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:46,391
Yo!

01:25:46,432 --> 01:25:48,184
I'll carry your bags.

01:25:49,435 --> 01:25:51,563
(whirring)

01:25:59,529 --> 01:26:01,573
- Just throw that stuff
in the back, Wild Man.

01:26:01,614 --> 01:26:03,158
You better put a
bungee cord on it.

01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:04,617
We might run into
some turbulence.

01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:06,494
- Right, Tiger Breath.

01:26:10,915 --> 01:26:12,167
- Thanks, Mom.

01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:14,335
- For what?

01:26:15,503 --> 01:26:17,881
- For finally bringing me here.

01:26:17,922 --> 01:26:19,883
I'm sorry about all the yelling.

01:26:19,924 --> 01:26:20,758
- Me too.

01:26:23,553 --> 01:26:25,430
You're so beautiful.

01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:28,558
You got everything
in front of you.

01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,726
Listen to me.

01:26:30,768 --> 01:26:32,145
Don't trust him.

01:26:33,396 --> 01:26:37,358
No matter what he does, what
he says, don't trust him.

01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:40,069
Okay?

01:26:40,111 --> 01:26:40,945
- Yeah.

01:26:49,287 --> 01:26:50,038
I'll call you.

01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:51,206
- Okay.
- Bye.

01:26:54,334 --> 01:26:56,878
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Hi.

01:26:56,920 --> 01:27:00,882
- Congratulations on
your graduation, honey.

01:27:00,924 --> 01:27:02,550
- Thanks.
- Oh, you look beautiful.

01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:03,593
I'm so proud of you.
- Thanks.

01:27:03,635 --> 01:27:04,844
- Let's go, let's go.
- Okay.

01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:06,304
- Come on, Tiger Breath.

01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:07,430
Take me with you.

01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:09,140
Just for a couple of weeks.

01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:10,433
- Tell you what, you
go to summer school

01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:11,351
and get your grades
up, show me something,

01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:14,062
then we'll talk about it, huh?

01:27:16,356 --> 01:27:18,191
Hey, I'll talk to you.

01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:27,200
(engine rumbling)

01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:29,577
(whirring)

01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:42,465
(gentle patriotic music)

01:27:42,507 --> 01:27:44,842
(applause)

01:27:46,844 --> 01:27:49,681
- Private first
class Laura Walker.

01:27:49,722 --> 01:27:52,600
Distinguished honor
graduate class 179.

01:27:52,642 --> 01:27:55,019
(applause)

01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:59,983
Private first
class Russel Green.

01:28:00,858 --> 01:28:02,026
(crickets chirping)

01:28:02,068 --> 01:28:03,236
- Hello, Dad.

01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:04,362
Hi, it's Laura.

01:28:05,363 --> 01:28:07,615
Well, um, I have some problems

01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:09,951
that I really can't
talk to Mom about.

01:28:09,993 --> 01:28:12,412
(dog barking)

01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:18,376
(birds chirping)

01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:32,682
(knocking)

01:28:35,727 --> 01:28:36,561
Dad.

01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:39,856
- I knew you'd screw it up.

01:28:43,067 --> 01:28:44,861
- So long, babe, I gotta run.

01:28:44,902 --> 01:28:45,778
See you later, Johnny.

01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:47,488
It was nice to finally meet you.

01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:49,657
- All right, I'll see ya.

01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:58,124
Well, you're just a loser
like all the rest of the kids.

01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:00,835
I had such high hopes for you.

01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:02,879
But you're not gonna
amount to a damn thing now.

01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:06,424
- Dad, everybody gets
married and has babies.

01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:09,594
- Yeah, but you had such a
great career going for you

01:29:09,635 --> 01:29:12,847
in the military and
honey, it is a sure thing.

01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:16,142
You had it and you
just screwed it up.

01:29:17,894 --> 01:29:21,522
I mean, sometimes I just
can't believe this family.

01:29:21,564 --> 01:29:23,733
(sighs)

01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:27,320
But you're my daughter
and I'll help you.

01:29:29,322 --> 01:29:29,697
And I can.

01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:33,743
But you gotta stay in the Army.

01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:35,828
- But Dad, I'm pregnant.

01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:39,540
That, that's why
I'm getting out,

01:29:39,582 --> 01:29:41,376
because I want this baby.

01:29:41,417 --> 01:29:43,378
- I know, I know, honey.

01:29:43,419 --> 01:29:44,504
But you're just not
thinking straight.

01:29:44,545 --> 01:29:45,713
Getting out's a bad idea.

01:29:45,755 --> 01:29:48,299
I mean how are you
gonna support yourself?

01:29:48,341 --> 01:29:49,300
You think he's gonna help you?

01:29:49,342 --> 01:29:51,469
You're gonna be on your butt.

01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:54,055
Listen, you got to get smart.

01:29:57,683 --> 01:29:59,394
You got a lot of time.

01:29:59,435 --> 01:30:00,728
You can have more kids.

01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:04,190
But you need to get
rid of this one now.

01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:06,359
- Mm no, I can't.

01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:07,235
I can't.

01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:09,654
No, it's not even
up to me anyway

01:30:09,695 --> 01:30:11,614
because Josh wants the baby too.

01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:14,283
- Well, sure he does.

01:30:14,325 --> 01:30:18,454
It makes him look good,
makes him feel like a man.

01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:20,289
But you just gotta start
thinking realistically

01:30:20,331 --> 01:30:21,791
about life, kid.

01:30:22,834 --> 01:30:24,836
Now, the Army is your ticket.

01:30:24,877 --> 01:30:28,381
I could help you
make some real money.

01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:30,508
As long as you stay in the Army.

01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:31,634
- What, what do you mean?

01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:34,429
- Would you risk
two years in jail

01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:38,224
to hear what I'm about to say?

01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:40,685
- Maybe.

01:30:40,726 --> 01:30:43,604
- No, no, there's
no maybes here.

01:30:43,646 --> 01:30:46,941
I mean this is like,
uh, like a mafia family,

01:30:46,983 --> 01:30:47,900
like in The Godfather.

01:30:47,942 --> 01:30:50,236
It's the real thing.

01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:52,488
There are no maybes.

01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:55,575
You see, all good
things are simple.

01:30:58,995 --> 01:31:03,124
I got this friend in Europe
that buys anything classified,

01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:06,335
tech manuals, encoded radio
traffic, crypto anything,

01:31:06,377 --> 01:31:09,255
but especially codes, key cards.

01:31:11,215 --> 01:31:12,467
Now, that's the big ticket.

01:31:12,508 --> 01:31:13,676
You've already got
your clearances.

01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:15,636
You're handling
encrypted traffic, right?

01:31:15,678 --> 01:31:17,013
- Yeah.

01:31:17,054 --> 01:31:19,724
- All we gotta do is get
you somewhere out here,

01:31:19,765 --> 01:31:22,435
get you some
headquarters somewhere

01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:24,312
and you gotta get smart,
honey, and move up.

01:31:24,353 --> 01:31:28,024
Listen, the kinda money
I'm talking about,

01:31:29,233 --> 01:31:31,611
you can have lots and
lots of babies later on

01:31:31,652 --> 01:31:33,821
when you can afford them.

01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:37,533
You need to put this
one up for adoption now.

01:31:37,575 --> 01:31:39,535
Now, you don't worry
about the arrangements.

01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:42,330
I'll take care of that for you.

01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,500
What do you say?

01:31:47,543 --> 01:31:48,377
- Um.

01:31:55,259 --> 01:31:56,385
- This is, uh..

01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:01,599
Just the beginning.

01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:09,190
- [Man] Just take it easy now.

01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:10,525
Whew!

01:32:10,566 --> 01:32:12,527
All right, careful now.

01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:15,863
(tires squeal)

01:32:18,074 --> 01:32:20,201
(grunts)

01:32:21,285 --> 01:32:23,913
(clock ticking)

01:32:27,583 --> 01:32:29,043
- Night, Ma, see
you in the morning.

01:32:29,085 --> 01:32:30,628
- Just a minute.

01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:32,505
I want to talk
with you, Michael.

01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:34,340
- It's two o'clock, Ma,
I gotta hit the sack.

01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:37,760
- Just sit down and
talk with me, okay?

01:32:41,222 --> 01:32:43,891
We can't go on pretending
like this anymore, Michael.

01:32:43,933 --> 01:32:45,393
You're on probation.

01:32:45,434 --> 01:32:49,105
You're not supposed
to be out so late.

01:32:49,146 --> 01:32:51,899
I know you're fooling around
with that girl, aren't you?

01:32:51,941 --> 01:32:53,484
- Come on, Mom.

01:32:53,526 --> 01:32:56,362
I was just out with Jimmy
and Dave watching some TV.

01:32:56,404 --> 01:32:58,239
- Don't you lie to me.

01:32:59,365 --> 01:33:01,867
I know you're having intercourse
with that Skenley girl.

01:33:01,909 --> 01:33:03,411
She buys you beers.

01:33:03,452 --> 01:33:05,371
I've seen the police report.

01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:06,497
- Look.

01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:11,419
I'm going to Virginia with Dad.

01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:13,504
- Listen to me, Michael.

01:33:17,258 --> 01:33:17,675
I love you.

01:33:19,802 --> 01:33:21,178
I don't want you
to go to Virginia

01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:24,098
this summer with your dad.

01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:27,059
I want you to stay here with me.

01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:28,436
Please, just...

01:33:29,687 --> 01:33:32,148
Just do that for me, please.

01:33:32,189 --> 01:33:33,608
- Mom, I love you.

01:33:36,819 --> 01:33:39,822
But it's time for me to
break away from here.

01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:40,823
I have to leave.

01:33:40,865 --> 01:33:42,783
I want to live with Dad.

01:33:42,825 --> 01:33:43,784
Understand?

01:33:45,328 --> 01:33:48,581
- Your father fools
around with whores.

01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:50,458
Is that what you want?

01:33:50,499 --> 01:33:51,083
You want to go down there,

01:33:51,083 --> 01:33:53,711
you'll end up chasing
whores your whole life.

01:33:53,753 --> 01:33:55,588
- Mom, you're always
on Dad's case.

01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:56,714
Lay off.

01:33:56,756 --> 01:33:58,424
He's my father.

01:33:58,466 --> 01:33:59,717
I'm going to bed.

01:33:59,759 --> 01:34:02,470
- Your father isn't the
great American patriot

01:34:02,511 --> 01:34:03,387
you think he is.

01:34:03,429 --> 01:34:04,680
- And what are you?

01:34:04,722 --> 01:34:06,891
- I'm not a spy
like your father!

01:34:06,932 --> 01:34:10,478
Your father's a spy
for the Soviet Union!

01:34:11,354 --> 01:34:12,897
- All right, Mom.

01:34:12,938 --> 01:34:14,732
You're absolutely right.

01:34:14,774 --> 01:34:16,275
I'll catch you later.

01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:18,319
- [Barbara] You're gonna
get like Johnny Walker!

01:34:18,361 --> 01:34:20,363
- [Michael] You bet!

01:34:20,404 --> 01:34:21,489
- [Barbara] No.

01:34:23,449 --> 01:34:26,535
(engine rumbling)

01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:36,796
- Every fish got
his favorite worm.

01:34:36,837 --> 01:34:39,548
This guy is building
a new patio out back

01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:42,968
and his worm is
cement. (chuckles)

01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:46,597
See, this is the oldest
swindle in the world.

01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:50,226
Men got all the money and
women have got what men need

01:34:50,267 --> 01:34:54,522
and everything else
is just negotiations.

01:34:54,563 --> 01:34:58,567
This guy's ex-wife, trying
to get her point across.

01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:04,156
She figures she didn't
get enough in the
divorce settlement,

01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:06,617
so she's tipped the
insurance company

01:35:06,659 --> 01:35:10,121
that this guy's back
problem is a phony.

01:35:12,206 --> 01:35:14,625
And look, look, here he comes.

01:35:17,294 --> 01:35:18,337
Look at him.

01:35:19,797 --> 01:35:20,756
He sees it.

01:35:22,007 --> 01:35:22,842
Yeah.

01:35:23,676 --> 01:35:24,802
Cement, baby.

01:35:26,262 --> 01:35:29,432
All right, he sees it,
but he can't believe it.

01:35:29,473 --> 01:35:33,769
Two bags, man. (chuckles)

01:35:33,811 --> 01:35:34,895
Smile.

01:35:34,937 --> 01:35:37,565
(camera clicks)

01:35:40,151 --> 01:35:42,445
Disability, give me a break.

01:35:42,486 --> 01:35:44,739
See, what'd I tell you?

01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:46,031
Here he comes again.

01:35:46,073 --> 01:35:46,824
Come on.

01:35:46,866 --> 01:35:50,077
(camera clicks)

01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:51,036
He sees us.

01:35:54,957 --> 01:35:56,375
Here.

01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:57,418
Keep shooting.

01:35:58,836 --> 01:36:01,297
Keep shooting, Mike,
that's where the money is.

01:36:01,338 --> 01:36:04,216
(camera clicks)

01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:08,763
- You son of a bitch!

01:36:08,804 --> 01:36:10,514
I'll kick your head in!

01:36:10,556 --> 01:36:11,307
(banging)

01:36:11,348 --> 01:36:12,349
Open that up!

01:36:12,391 --> 01:36:13,893
I'll get you!

01:36:13,934 --> 01:36:15,060
I'll get you!

01:36:16,437 --> 01:36:18,814
(chuckles)

01:36:20,983 --> 01:36:22,401
(dance music plays)

01:36:22,443 --> 01:36:25,488
(people chattering)

01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:28,365
- Don't you do that, honey!

01:36:28,407 --> 01:36:29,408
(hollering)

01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:30,284
Yes, yes!

01:36:31,827 --> 01:36:33,662
Oh, man.
- Mix it up.

01:36:33,704 --> 01:36:35,873
(laughs)

01:36:38,834 --> 01:36:41,670
- See, it's like a
chess game, Mike.

01:36:41,712 --> 01:36:44,757
Every case is the same, but
every case is different.

01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:47,676
You got to think it
out, perfect setup.

01:36:47,718 --> 01:36:51,138
Then the other guy does
all the work, right?

01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:53,057
If you figured it
out just right,

01:36:53,098 --> 01:36:56,268
bingo, another sucker
bites the dust.

01:36:57,686 --> 01:37:01,440
Ah, but these are
just everyday turkeys.

01:37:01,482 --> 01:37:03,526
I just do this to keep my
hand in between the big stuff.

01:37:03,567 --> 01:37:04,401
- Yeah.

01:37:07,488 --> 01:37:09,323
What kind of big stuff?

01:37:09,365 --> 01:37:12,535
- Hey, you were good
the other day, Wild Man,

01:37:12,576 --> 01:37:14,078
but you're not old enough yet.

01:37:14,119 --> 01:37:15,412
- Hey!

01:37:15,454 --> 01:37:17,373
I can do anything you
can do, Tiger Breath.

01:37:17,414 --> 01:37:18,707
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

01:37:18,749 --> 01:37:20,209
Old enough for what?

01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:23,003
- Hey, when you're
ready, I'll let you know.

01:37:23,045 --> 01:37:24,922
Show me something
first, finish school.

01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:26,507
- Oh!

01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:30,427
- Hey, bring us another
round over here.

01:37:30,469 --> 01:37:31,512
So, uh...

01:37:33,222 --> 01:37:34,390
So what were you
thinking about doing

01:37:34,431 --> 01:37:36,392
when you graduate
from high school?

01:37:36,433 --> 01:37:38,894
- I'm gonna be a private
investigator like you.

01:37:38,936 --> 01:37:40,437
Team Walker, right?

01:37:43,399 --> 01:37:44,483
- Wrong.

01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,657
That's what I thought
you were thinking.

01:37:51,699 --> 01:37:56,328
Nah, this is a career for after
you retire from something.

01:37:56,370 --> 01:38:00,416
You know, I'd be thinking
military if I was you.

01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:03,002
Like see the world,

01:38:05,629 --> 01:38:10,384
learn a job skill on the
cutting edge of technology.

01:38:10,426 --> 01:38:12,469
Get it on in a foreign
language, right?

01:38:12,511 --> 01:38:13,596
- Yeah.

01:38:14,597 --> 01:38:16,098
Okay.

01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:20,352
I've been thinking about
joining the Navy like you did.

01:38:20,394 --> 01:38:22,229
- Well all right, son.

01:38:23,355 --> 01:38:25,524
You know, that'd
make me real proud.

01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:27,151
Here's to it.

01:38:27,192 --> 01:38:28,611
To us.

01:38:28,652 --> 01:38:31,989
Team Walker and the
United States Navy.

01:38:34,992 --> 01:38:37,828
(waves splashing)

01:38:44,627 --> 01:38:46,086
- What are you doing
reading that schematic

01:38:46,128 --> 01:38:47,755
out here, Whitworth?

01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:53,302
If anybody got ahold of this,
they could build a decoder.

01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:54,762
Understand?
- Yes, sir.

01:38:54,803 --> 01:38:56,472
- Now damn it, this
should only be looked at

01:38:56,513 --> 01:38:59,058
in a secure supervised area.

01:38:59,099 --> 01:39:00,893
That means the code
vault, Whitworth.

01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:02,186
- Yes, sir.

01:39:02,227 --> 01:39:05,064
- Now if I catch this
kind of violation again,

01:39:05,105 --> 01:39:07,066
I'll put you on report.

01:39:09,068 --> 01:39:12,529
♪ Happy birthday to you

01:39:13,948 --> 01:39:17,409
♪ Happy birthday to you

01:39:18,494 --> 01:39:22,206
♪ Happy birthday Admiral Art

01:39:24,541 --> 01:39:27,753
♪ Happy birthday to you

01:39:29,254 --> 01:39:31,090
- [Woman] Make a wish!

01:39:32,341 --> 01:39:33,175
- Yeah!

01:39:33,676 --> 01:39:35,761
Hey, I'm the
mastermind of this gig.

01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:37,054
How about my hug, huh?

01:39:37,096 --> 01:39:38,681
- No, you're not
the hugging kind.

01:39:38,722 --> 01:39:40,474
- Oh!

01:39:40,516 --> 01:39:43,352
You know, I got a
son about your age.

01:39:43,394 --> 01:39:43,894
I got an idea.

01:39:43,936 --> 01:39:45,646
We're gonna be out
on the boat tomorrow.

01:39:45,688 --> 01:39:46,939
Why don't you drop
by and meet him?

01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:48,107
I think you two kids
might hit it off.

01:39:48,148 --> 01:39:48,899
What do you say?

01:39:48,941 --> 01:39:51,318
- I'll think about it.

01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:54,154
- Look, it's in the
afternoon, don't worry.

01:39:54,196 --> 01:39:56,991
He's a real nice kid,
he's not like me.

01:39:57,032 --> 01:39:59,493
- Well, then how can I say no?

01:39:59,535 --> 01:40:00,285
- [John] All right.

01:40:00,327 --> 01:40:03,288
(birds chirping)

01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:20,264
- Oh man.

01:40:21,557 --> 01:40:25,978
If that old kook does
not have his girlfriend,

01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:28,439
I am definitely taking a hike.

01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:37,656
- [John] Hey,
you're looking good.

01:40:37,698 --> 01:40:39,074
- Hi, honey.

01:40:39,116 --> 01:40:39,950
- Hi.

01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:43,120
- Come on, glad
you could make it.

01:40:43,162 --> 01:40:44,246
Welcome aboard.

01:40:44,288 --> 01:40:45,664
- Thank you.

01:40:45,706 --> 01:40:46,957
- Mike's gonna be real happy.

01:40:46,999 --> 01:40:48,459
Mike, come here.

01:40:50,002 --> 01:40:51,211
This is the girl I
was telling you about.

01:40:51,253 --> 01:40:53,172
This is Rachel Allen, Mike.

01:40:53,213 --> 01:40:54,590
- [Michael] Pleased to meet you.

01:40:54,631 --> 01:40:55,841
- Hi.

01:40:55,883 --> 01:40:58,135
- Well come on,
let's cast off, huh?

01:40:58,177 --> 01:40:59,470
I'll get you a drink.

01:40:59,511 --> 01:41:03,432
Let's get this cruise up
to flag speed, sailor.

01:41:08,437 --> 01:41:09,563
- Well, uh...

01:41:10,355 --> 01:41:11,398
How about another drink?

01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:12,941
- No, thanks.

01:41:12,983 --> 01:41:14,443
One is my limit.

01:41:18,447 --> 01:41:19,531
Where do you go to school?

01:41:19,573 --> 01:41:20,949
- Oh, you wouldn't know it.

01:41:20,991 --> 01:41:22,367
- I might.

01:41:22,409 --> 01:41:23,744
- It's a private place.

01:41:23,786 --> 01:41:26,914
No big deal, it's just a
small place for the, uh,

01:41:26,955 --> 01:41:28,332
mentally deficient.

01:41:28,373 --> 01:41:30,209
- Try me, I mean I've lived
around here my whole life.

01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:31,502
I might've heard of it.

01:41:31,543 --> 01:41:33,337
- Sonnenbrille Academy.

01:41:33,378 --> 01:41:35,047
- You gotta be kidding.

01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:38,425
My stepsister goes
there, Connie Allen.

01:41:39,343 --> 01:41:41,470
- Right, right, she
goes out with, uh,

01:41:41,512 --> 01:41:42,930
oh what's his name,
what's his name?

01:41:42,971 --> 01:41:44,890
- Billy.
- Billy DeButte.

01:41:44,932 --> 01:41:46,767
Billy Butt we call him.

01:41:46,809 --> 01:41:48,185
(laughs)

01:41:48,227 --> 01:41:49,478
- No way.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,105
- Billy Butt?
- Yeah.

01:41:51,146 --> 01:41:52,523
- He is, he is.

01:41:54,399 --> 01:41:56,527
(laughter)

01:41:58,362 --> 01:41:59,863
- It's getting late.

01:41:59,905 --> 01:42:01,365
You know, if you're
not in bed by 10,

01:42:01,406 --> 01:42:03,283
you don't get any, Johnny.

01:42:03,325 --> 01:42:05,410
Goodnight, you two.

01:42:05,452 --> 01:42:07,788
- Well, nice to see you, Rachel.

01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:08,997
Glad you could
make it out today.

01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:13,836
Goodnight, goodnight. (chuckles)

01:42:13,877 --> 01:42:16,922
- They're quite a
pair, aren't they?

01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:20,384
But you don't have to go yet.

01:42:22,052 --> 01:42:25,055
- I really had a
good time today.

01:42:25,097 --> 01:42:27,474
Thanks for having me.

01:42:27,516 --> 01:42:28,350
- Me too.

01:42:30,185 --> 01:42:32,104
(hums)

01:42:50,330 --> 01:42:52,624
- Look, I'm acing biology,

01:42:53,917 --> 01:42:56,587
so I know that your
pituitary gland

01:42:56,628 --> 01:43:00,799
is sending some very
interesting signals right now

01:43:00,841 --> 01:43:02,551
and I don't want you
to have a problem

01:43:02,593 --> 01:43:03,635
going to sleep tonight.

01:43:03,677 --> 01:43:06,138
So I think I'll say goodbye.

01:43:07,347 --> 01:43:09,349
Don't worry, I can
get to my car okay

01:43:09,391 --> 01:43:12,352
and I really did
have a great time.

01:43:12,394 --> 01:43:13,478
See ya.

01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,314
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:43:15,355 --> 01:43:16,190
I had a...

01:43:17,399 --> 01:43:19,985
I had a good time too.

01:43:20,027 --> 01:43:23,071
Um, can I give you
a call sometime?

01:43:23,113 --> 01:43:24,448
- That would be great.

01:43:24,489 --> 01:43:25,741
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:43:27,576 --> 01:43:29,036
Well, goodnight.

01:43:31,163 --> 01:43:32,206
- Goodnight.

01:43:38,545 --> 01:43:40,505
- Jerry, old buddy,
this is just 1/3

01:43:40,547 --> 01:43:42,966
of the money as a down payment.

01:43:43,008 --> 01:43:45,093
But you gotta give them three
months worth of key lists.

01:43:45,135 --> 01:43:49,389
They want the complete 90 days,
no breaks guaranteed, huh?

01:43:51,391 --> 01:43:51,975
(sighs)

01:43:51,975 --> 01:43:54,978
- John, this money is
nothing, you know that?

01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:56,313
I mean what it would cost them

01:43:56,355 --> 01:43:58,315
to break the codes we're
giving them is millions.

01:43:58,357 --> 01:44:00,525
They're getting it cheap.

01:44:00,567 --> 01:44:01,985
- Hey, you know what.

01:44:02,027 --> 01:44:03,237
That's a good bargaining point.

01:44:03,278 --> 01:44:06,531
I'll bring that up
next time I see them.

01:44:11,078 --> 01:44:13,997
- Means I gotta put out
to active duty again

01:44:14,039 --> 01:44:15,415
in order to get access.

01:44:15,457 --> 01:44:17,626
You know I just got
married and my uh,

01:44:17,668 --> 01:44:20,379
my wife doesn't want me
going away so much anymore.

01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:23,715
- Ah, she'll do what
you tell her, right?

01:44:24,758 --> 01:44:25,759
Does she know?

01:44:25,801 --> 01:44:27,469
- No.

01:44:27,511 --> 01:44:28,804
I told her I was
working with you

01:44:28,845 --> 01:44:30,305
on some sort of secret
deal with the government.

01:44:30,347 --> 01:44:31,306
That's all she knows.

01:44:31,348 --> 01:44:32,474
(chuckles)

01:44:32,516 --> 01:44:36,186
She wants me to get
out of the Navy, John.

01:44:39,523 --> 01:44:41,316
You know, look,
you knew that this

01:44:41,358 --> 01:44:42,818
wasn't gonna last forever.

01:44:42,859 --> 01:44:45,362
It's time for me to get out.

01:44:45,404 --> 01:44:46,405
- Well, Jerry.

01:44:47,906 --> 01:44:49,866
You know, your retirement's
gonna cause me some problems.

01:44:49,908 --> 01:44:50,742
But uh...

01:44:52,077 --> 01:44:53,745
Man, it's really gonna
hurt you financially.

01:44:53,787 --> 01:44:54,663
I mean I thought you liked it

01:44:54,705 --> 01:44:57,124
in these big $100,000 bingos.

01:44:57,958 --> 01:44:59,209
Wait.

01:44:59,251 --> 01:45:01,378
What are you gonna
do when you get out?

01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:02,504
Huh?

01:45:03,088 --> 01:45:05,465
I mean, Navy pension
is kinda small potatoes

01:45:05,507 --> 01:45:06,466
for you now, isn't it?

01:45:06,508 --> 01:45:08,093
What is it, uh...

01:45:09,177 --> 01:45:12,389
12,000 a year and
change after taxes, hmm?

01:45:13,473 --> 01:45:14,433
Here's to it.

01:45:14,474 --> 01:45:16,393
- Well at least there's no risk.

01:45:16,435 --> 01:45:18,437
- Ah, what risk?

01:45:18,478 --> 01:45:21,857
You know, the FBI are too
busy dressing up like Arabs

01:45:21,898 --> 01:45:23,191
and catching congressmen.

01:45:23,233 --> 01:45:26,320
There's no risk and
there's no taxes.

01:45:26,361 --> 01:45:27,529
- What if we're caught, Johnny?

01:45:27,571 --> 01:45:29,448
What if we get arrested?

01:45:29,489 --> 01:45:31,950
- There's still no risk.

01:45:31,992 --> 01:45:34,286
We go to the CIA and
become double agents.

01:45:34,328 --> 01:45:35,287
It's standard procedure.

01:45:35,329 --> 01:45:36,913
- Don't joke about this, Johnny!

01:45:36,955 --> 01:45:37,831
- Hey!

01:45:37,873 --> 01:45:39,249
I'm not joking.

01:45:40,751 --> 01:45:43,587
- When the time
came, you retired.

01:45:44,963 --> 01:45:47,507
I put in my papers
for fleet reserve.

01:45:47,549 --> 01:45:50,844
Once they're approved, my
resignation becomes effective.

01:45:50,886 --> 01:45:53,055
One year, September next.

01:45:57,392 --> 01:45:58,477
- Okay.

01:46:00,228 --> 01:46:01,605
It's all right.

01:46:05,025 --> 01:46:05,859
Listen.

01:46:07,319 --> 01:46:08,737
September's down the road
and around the bend, right?

01:46:08,779 --> 01:46:13,033
Come on, let's enjoy what
we got going here now, huh?

01:46:14,534 --> 01:46:15,285
Come on.

01:46:15,327 --> 01:46:17,454
(chuckles)

01:46:19,498 --> 01:46:22,125
(glasses clink)

01:46:23,543 --> 01:46:25,462
Oh yeah, listen.

01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:27,631
The guy said they were having
trouble with the KWR-37,

01:46:27,672 --> 01:46:29,341
the one that made it
from the schematic.

01:46:29,383 --> 01:46:29,966
Said it's garbling.

01:46:29,966 --> 01:46:33,970
I said listen, my man
Jerry, he's the expert.

01:46:34,012 --> 01:46:36,390
- Yeah, well they're
probably just not reading

01:46:36,431 --> 01:46:37,808
the crossover logic right.

01:46:37,849 --> 01:46:39,935
That stuff's super complicated.

01:46:39,976 --> 01:46:40,769
- Yeah?

01:46:42,312 --> 01:46:43,146
Here.

01:46:46,441 --> 01:46:47,526
Mark it for me.

01:46:54,491 --> 01:46:57,244
(gloomy music)

01:46:59,996 --> 01:47:03,542
(booming and crackling)

01:47:03,583 --> 01:47:05,836
(yelling)

01:47:12,592 --> 01:47:15,387
- Maybe you could
go in the Navy.

01:47:15,429 --> 01:47:20,350
They got these deals where
you're stationed together.

01:47:20,392 --> 01:47:24,187
- Michael, you don't have to
go in the service, you know?

01:47:24,229 --> 01:47:26,857
You could get a
job with your dad.

01:47:26,898 --> 01:47:30,110
We could get an apartment,
go to school at UVR.

01:47:30,152 --> 01:47:31,903
Oh, wouldn't that be fun?

01:47:31,945 --> 01:47:33,822
- Yeah, but I gotta go.

01:47:33,864 --> 01:47:35,949
I already promised my dad.

01:47:35,991 --> 01:47:37,784
He's expecting me to.

01:47:37,826 --> 01:47:40,954
- You do everything
your dad expects?

01:47:41,997 --> 01:47:44,374
- Yeah, I guess I do.

01:47:44,416 --> 01:47:46,877
It was okay until I met you.

01:47:48,211 --> 01:47:51,631
Boy, he really messed
up there, didn't he?

01:47:54,801 --> 01:47:56,428
- What's the matter?

01:47:57,554 --> 01:47:58,930
- I don't know.

01:48:00,974 --> 01:48:02,017
Sometimes...

01:48:03,518 --> 01:48:06,855
I feel like I'm in
some kind of prison.

01:48:06,897 --> 01:48:08,064
- You're not.

01:48:10,233 --> 01:48:11,109
You're free.

01:48:11,151 --> 01:48:13,737
It's Independence Day, see?

01:48:13,778 --> 01:48:17,240
(crackling and booming)

01:48:18,992 --> 01:48:20,952
- So how do I tell him?

01:48:22,913 --> 01:48:27,459
- You walk up to him and
smile your cute little smile,

01:48:27,501 --> 01:48:31,046
definitely take
advantage of the smile,

01:48:31,087 --> 01:48:34,549
and say "Dad, it's a
free country, man."

01:48:37,552 --> 01:48:38,970
- Man?

01:48:39,012 --> 01:48:40,847
- Well, maybe not man.

01:48:46,478 --> 01:48:48,313
- Raise your right hand.

01:48:48,355 --> 01:48:52,359
Say I, state your full
name and repeat after me.

01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:54,402
- I, Michael Lance Walker.

01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:56,571
- Do solemnly swear.

01:48:56,613 --> 01:48:58,198
- [All] Do solemnly swear.

01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:59,574
- That I will support and defend

01:48:59,616 --> 01:49:02,369
the Constitution of the
United States of America.

01:49:02,410 --> 01:49:03,870
- [All] That I will
support and defend

01:49:03,912 --> 01:49:06,414
the Constitution of the
United States of America.

01:49:06,456 --> 01:49:08,542
- [Officer] Against all
enemies, foreign and domestic.

01:49:08,583 --> 01:49:12,837
- [All] Against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

01:49:18,718 --> 01:49:21,596
(siren blaring)

01:49:27,435 --> 01:49:30,522
(engine rumbling)

01:50:08,351 --> 01:50:11,396
(people chattering)

01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:25,410
(clock strikes)
(birds chirping)

01:50:25,452 --> 01:50:29,539
(horse hooves clicking)

01:50:29,581 --> 01:50:32,208
(people chattering)

01:50:32,250 --> 01:50:34,377
(sinister music)

01:50:34,419 --> 01:50:35,378
- Hello, John.

01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:36,755
- Hello.

01:50:36,796 --> 01:50:38,465
- John, this is your new friend.

01:50:38,506 --> 01:50:40,425
He will be meeting
you from now on.

01:50:40,467 --> 01:50:41,468
- Yeah, okay.

01:50:41,509 --> 01:50:42,719
How are ya?

01:50:42,761 --> 01:50:44,304
- So what have you
brought us this time?

01:50:44,346 --> 01:50:46,681
Was your trip
pleasantly uneventful?

01:50:46,723 --> 01:50:48,808
- No, somebody was
following me again.

01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:49,934
I had to shake them.

01:50:49,976 --> 01:50:51,353
Took the subway.

01:50:51,394 --> 01:50:54,856
- Give us your
camera case, please.

01:50:54,898 --> 01:50:57,359
- You must forgive our plan.

01:50:58,568 --> 01:51:01,029
The photographs at your last
drop were not very good,

01:51:01,071 --> 01:51:02,906
every one out of focus.

01:51:02,947 --> 01:51:05,367
- Everything from
the drop is useless.

01:51:05,408 --> 01:51:06,701
- Why didn't you
tell me this before?

01:51:06,743 --> 01:51:08,370
- We had our reasons.

01:51:08,411 --> 01:51:11,164
Your friend has never before
taken a bad photograph.

01:51:11,206 --> 01:51:15,085
Why now is every roll
overexposed, fault, useless?

01:51:15,126 --> 01:51:17,128
It is obvious this
is intentional.

01:51:17,170 --> 01:51:19,297
This is a signal that he
has changed allegiance.

01:51:19,339 --> 01:51:22,258
- No, no, no, look, he
just wants more money.

01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:24,260
He thinks what he's
giving us is worth more.

01:51:24,302 --> 01:51:24,886
He's talking about
a million dollars.

01:51:24,886 --> 01:51:27,347
He's just trying to put
a squeeze on us here.

01:51:27,389 --> 01:51:30,266
Look, he's got copies,
I guarantee it.

01:51:30,308 --> 01:51:31,768
He doesn't make mistakes.

01:51:31,810 --> 01:51:33,561
Now I know I can get
new copies from him.

01:51:33,603 --> 01:51:35,188
- You will get nothing.

01:51:35,230 --> 01:51:37,440
Until he gives us clear
photos for all documents,

01:51:37,482 --> 01:51:39,067
the operation is not secure.

01:51:39,109 --> 01:51:40,902
- No one has lost confidence
in you, my friend,

01:51:40,944 --> 01:51:42,237
but we have experience in this.

01:51:42,278 --> 01:51:42,946
There are many
signs that the man

01:51:42,946 --> 01:51:45,532
has begun to betray our trust
and this is one of them.

01:51:45,573 --> 01:51:48,201
This is very serious business.

01:51:48,243 --> 01:51:50,578
It's important that
Whitworth continue his work.

01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:52,539
- Look, everything is in
the camera case and more.

01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:53,832
Much more.

01:51:53,873 --> 01:51:57,043
It'll be in the next
drop, I guarantee it.

01:51:58,128 --> 01:51:59,921
(thuds)

01:51:59,963 --> 01:52:01,339
Look.

01:52:01,381 --> 01:52:02,882
I know this guy.

01:52:02,924 --> 01:52:05,635
I lived his life,
you understand?

01:52:05,677 --> 01:52:08,888
Half the things he knows
he learned from me.

01:52:08,930 --> 01:52:11,474
Money's what winds his toy.

01:52:11,516 --> 01:52:13,476
Just leave him to me.

01:52:14,811 --> 01:52:18,314
- This will be our last
meeting, my friend.

01:52:18,356 --> 01:52:21,943
I give you this
special ballpoint pen.

01:52:21,985 --> 01:52:24,738
It's in memory of
our friendship.

01:52:30,535 --> 01:52:32,328
- Yeah, well thanks.

01:52:33,496 --> 01:52:36,082
(suspenseful music)

01:52:36,124 --> 01:52:38,543
I don't have anything for you.

01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:44,299
Goodbye, my dear friend.

01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:45,592
- Get screwed.

01:52:56,728 --> 01:52:59,439
(engine rumbles)

01:53:05,528 --> 01:53:08,573
(people chattering)

01:53:31,471 --> 01:53:34,557
(brakes squeal)

01:53:34,599 --> 01:53:38,019
(dramatic music)

01:53:38,061 --> 01:53:40,313
(yelling)

01:53:56,538 --> 01:53:59,415
(brakes squeal)

01:54:38,288 --> 01:54:40,999
(ethereal music)

01:54:43,751 --> 01:54:48,006
(brakes squeal)
(birds chirping)

01:54:48,882 --> 01:54:51,551
(dog barking)

01:54:53,344 --> 01:54:55,597
(banging)

01:54:56,472 --> 01:54:57,515
- Hey, John.

01:55:03,479 --> 01:55:06,482
- All your photographs
were out of focus.

01:55:06,524 --> 01:55:08,192
- [Jerry] What are
you talking about?

01:55:08,234 --> 01:55:10,570
- You hung me out to dry, man!

01:55:10,612 --> 01:55:13,072
They almost killed
me because of you.

01:55:13,114 --> 01:55:14,115
If you wanted to
increase the price,

01:55:14,157 --> 01:55:16,159
you should have told me.

01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:17,035
Look.

01:55:18,077 --> 01:55:19,829
This is for you, read it.

01:55:19,871 --> 01:55:20,705
Read it!

01:55:34,302 --> 01:55:36,846
- That's not fair, John.

01:55:36,888 --> 01:55:38,473
That's not fair.

01:55:38,514 --> 01:55:40,558
It's not my fault the
pictures didn't come out.

01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:41,434
- No?

01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:44,479
Who the hell's
fault was it then?

01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:46,230
I mean, you take
thousands of photographs

01:55:46,272 --> 01:55:47,398
and all of the sudden, man,

01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:49,150
everything comes
up out of focus.

01:55:49,192 --> 01:55:53,529
- I don't think we're being
paid enough, all right?

01:55:53,571 --> 01:55:55,365
Now, I deserve to
be paid regular.

01:55:55,406 --> 01:55:56,449
Now you can go back
and tell them that

01:55:56,491 --> 01:55:57,825
or else I'm out of all this.

01:55:57,867 --> 01:55:58,868
They can get some cheaper labor.

01:55:58,910 --> 01:56:00,620
- Sit down, Jerry.

01:56:00,662 --> 01:56:02,372
Where you gonna go?

01:56:02,413 --> 01:56:02,997
Huh?

01:56:02,997 --> 01:56:05,291
Where you gonna spend
your hard earned money?

01:56:05,333 --> 01:56:07,335
You're a dead man.

01:56:07,377 --> 01:56:10,004
As of this minute,
you are a dead man

01:56:10,046 --> 01:56:13,132
and I'm the only person in
the world keeping you alive.

01:56:13,174 --> 01:56:14,425
- That's not true, John?

01:56:14,467 --> 01:56:15,635
- No?

01:56:15,677 --> 01:56:16,844
You don't think so?

01:56:16,886 --> 01:56:17,804
Okay, fine.

01:56:19,055 --> 01:56:20,098
I'll see ya.

01:56:21,683 --> 01:56:23,935
You just see what happens.

01:56:25,228 --> 01:56:27,271
- Johnny, wait a minute.

01:56:29,565 --> 01:56:32,485
- You know what we're gonna do?

01:56:32,527 --> 01:56:35,530
We're gonna take a little trip

01:56:35,571 --> 01:56:38,491
and we're gonna get the
copies of those photographs.

01:56:38,533 --> 01:56:40,785
I know you took plenty
of copies, didn't you?

01:56:40,827 --> 01:56:42,453
All in focus, right?

01:56:43,705 --> 01:56:45,039
Right.

01:56:45,081 --> 01:56:47,500
And we're gonna
take those copies

01:56:47,542 --> 01:56:50,253
and we're gonna send
them to our friends

01:56:50,294 --> 01:56:54,048
and you're gonna count
yourself damned lucky.

01:56:56,551 --> 01:56:57,510
- Look at the boat go up.

01:56:57,552 --> 01:56:59,178
Do you see the boat?

01:57:00,388 --> 01:57:02,348
So what made you look me
up after all this time?

01:57:02,390 --> 01:57:03,933
I thought you weren't
speaking to me.

01:57:03,975 --> 01:57:06,894
- Yes, atta boy, atta boy.

01:57:06,936 --> 01:57:08,521
- Huh?

01:57:08,563 --> 01:57:11,024
- Well, I don't know, I was
just out here on business

01:57:11,065 --> 01:57:13,568
and I wanted to see my grandson,

01:57:13,609 --> 01:57:14,694
wanted to see how
you were doing,

01:57:14,736 --> 01:57:16,112
so I decided I'd look you up.

01:57:16,154 --> 01:57:17,405
- How come you always
manage to look me up

01:57:17,447 --> 01:57:18,865
when I'm down and broke?

01:57:18,906 --> 01:57:19,866
(chuckles)

01:57:19,907 --> 01:57:22,869
- Well that's not too hard.

01:57:22,910 --> 01:57:25,204
I mean ask yourself
the real question.

01:57:25,246 --> 01:57:28,166
Do you want me to
help you or not?

01:57:28,207 --> 01:57:30,710
- I can't reenlist
because of Chris.

01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:33,796
- Well, don't worry about that.

01:57:33,838 --> 01:57:36,299
I talked to a recruiter for you.

01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:39,093
He says all you gotta
do is sign custody over

01:57:39,135 --> 01:57:41,220
to Barbara and me.

01:57:41,262 --> 01:57:43,556
I mean, Barb would
love to have Chris.

01:57:43,598 --> 01:57:45,683
Get that welfare check.

01:57:45,725 --> 01:57:46,893
What do you say?

01:57:46,934 --> 01:57:49,353
- I'm not letting go of Chris.

01:57:49,395 --> 01:57:51,355
- Listen to me, listen.

01:57:51,397 --> 01:57:54,358
One week max with
Barbara, that's all.

01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:56,486
You just fill out
the custody form,

01:57:56,527 --> 01:57:57,904
re-up in the Army,
get your posting,

01:57:57,945 --> 01:57:59,614
rent a decent apartment.

01:57:59,655 --> 01:58:02,450
I'll bring Chris back
to you the same day.

01:58:02,492 --> 01:58:04,660
I'll even get you a sitter.

01:58:04,702 --> 01:58:07,163
You know, you gotta start
thinking about Chris's future.

01:58:07,205 --> 01:58:10,500
I mean, my man in Europe's
getting worried about you.

01:58:10,541 --> 01:58:11,000
He's beginning to think

01:58:11,042 --> 01:58:14,045
you're gonna get
too old to reenlist.

01:58:14,087 --> 01:58:16,047
- You've talked to
somebody about me?

01:58:16,089 --> 01:58:19,383
- Yeah, it's just like
any other business.

01:58:19,425 --> 01:58:22,386
I discuss changes,
personnel moves,

01:58:23,429 --> 01:58:25,098
inventory with my client.

01:58:25,139 --> 01:58:26,516
- I don't believe it.

01:58:26,557 --> 01:58:28,434
- Ah, hey, come on.

01:58:28,476 --> 01:58:29,477
Look this way.

01:58:29,519 --> 01:58:31,604
One more with you and Chris.

01:58:31,646 --> 01:58:32,980
Smile, come on.

01:58:34,065 --> 01:58:38,319
(upbeat band music)
(cheering)

01:59:08,558 --> 01:59:11,477
- I want you to be my wife.

01:59:11,519 --> 01:59:13,187
Will you marry me?

01:59:14,188 --> 01:59:15,022
Huh?

01:59:17,608 --> 01:59:19,777
(laughs)

01:59:24,323 --> 01:59:26,576
- What's the matter?
- Nothin'.

01:59:26,617 --> 01:59:28,327
- What?
- Nothin'.

01:59:28,369 --> 01:59:29,370
- What?

01:59:29,412 --> 01:59:30,496
- Um.

01:59:32,498 --> 01:59:35,042
It's something, I guess.

01:59:35,084 --> 01:59:37,837
I've been meaning to tell you.

01:59:37,879 --> 01:59:39,213
It's difficult.

01:59:42,341 --> 01:59:44,218
- You don't have to
ship out again, do you?

01:59:44,260 --> 01:59:46,470
- No, no, no, that's not it.

01:59:49,182 --> 01:59:50,016
Look.

01:59:51,851 --> 01:59:56,105
I can see what you're thinking
when I look in your eyes.

01:59:57,481 --> 02:00:00,484
So tell me the truth, okay?

02:00:00,526 --> 02:00:01,777
- Okay.

02:00:01,819 --> 02:00:03,362
I will, what is it?

02:00:05,281 --> 02:00:07,909
- I don't want to have any kids.

02:00:10,286 --> 02:00:12,538
I want to get a vasectomy.

02:00:14,916 --> 02:00:17,293
- That's it?
- Yeah.

02:00:17,335 --> 02:00:20,296
(chuckles)

02:00:20,338 --> 02:00:21,589
- Oh, Michael.

02:00:22,506 --> 02:00:23,507
I was worried.

02:00:24,717 --> 02:00:26,802
I don't want to
have kids either.

02:00:26,844 --> 02:00:27,595
- No?

02:00:27,637 --> 02:00:28,679
- Ever, any.

02:00:32,183 --> 02:00:34,810
I just want it to be me and you.

02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:51,619
- It's too easy to mess up kids.

02:00:51,661 --> 02:00:52,411
- Mm hmm.

02:00:52,453 --> 02:00:55,206
(solemn music)

02:01:14,141 --> 02:01:16,519
(phone ringing)

02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:17,520
- [Johnny] Hello?

02:01:17,561 --> 02:01:18,312
- [Barbara] Hello.

02:01:18,354 --> 02:01:19,438
- [Johnny] Who is this?

02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:21,315
- It's me, Barbara.

02:01:21,357 --> 02:01:21,899
- [Johnny] I don't need this.

02:01:21,941 --> 02:01:24,443
- Wait, I have to talk
to you about Michael.

02:01:24,485 --> 02:01:25,236
- [Johnny] Barbara,
leave me alone.

02:01:25,278 --> 02:01:26,279
- Don't hang up!

02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:28,406
(clicking)

02:01:28,447 --> 02:01:31,534
(waves splashing)

02:01:36,497 --> 02:01:37,999
- I mean, I'd like
to see you make E3

02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:40,459
the first time up like I did.

02:01:40,501 --> 02:01:42,795
It ain't easy, you
gotta bone up on it.

02:01:42,837 --> 02:01:44,213
(chuckles)

02:01:44,255 --> 02:01:44,839
Ah, what am I saying?

02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:48,467
You'll be wearing my
chief's hat before too long.

02:01:48,509 --> 02:01:50,011
You know I've been
saving it for you?

02:01:50,052 --> 02:01:51,345
- That'll be hot.

02:01:51,387 --> 02:01:54,390
Chief Michael Walker
reporting for duty, sir.

02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:57,435
- Yeah, Wild Man! (chuckles)

02:01:57,476 --> 02:01:59,562
You got this Navy
stuff figured out.

02:01:59,603 --> 02:02:03,274
They're suckers for all
that enthusiastic gung-ho.

02:02:03,316 --> 02:02:05,067
You give them that attitude
and you can lay back behind it

02:02:05,109 --> 02:02:06,402
and have yourself a ball,

02:02:06,444 --> 02:02:09,238
get yourself some
Navy bras, right?

02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:11,324
Oh, but I forgot.

02:02:11,365 --> 02:02:12,783
You're a married man now.

02:02:12,825 --> 02:02:13,576
(laughs)

02:02:13,617 --> 02:02:14,869
- Not yet.

02:02:14,910 --> 02:02:16,495
But don't worry about me.

02:02:16,537 --> 02:02:18,080
I'm getting mine.

02:02:18,122 --> 02:02:19,206
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

02:02:19,248 --> 02:02:21,417
- Yeah? (laughs)

02:02:21,459 --> 02:02:24,503
Well, I guess you're
old enough now.

02:02:24,545 --> 02:02:27,089
Old enough for a lot of things.

02:02:27,131 --> 02:02:28,174
- Like what?

02:02:30,217 --> 02:02:33,471
- Like knowing how I make my
real money, serious stuff.

02:02:33,512 --> 02:02:34,555
- What do you mean?

02:02:34,597 --> 02:02:35,848
- I mean a couple
of hundred thousand,

02:02:35,890 --> 02:02:38,893
maybe a half a million
in a good year.

02:02:38,934 --> 02:02:40,311
It's getting better and better.

02:02:40,353 --> 02:02:41,395
- Come on, Dad.

02:02:41,437 --> 02:02:43,564
- Hey, you're a natural, kid.

02:02:43,606 --> 02:02:46,317
I spotted it in you
right from the start.

02:02:46,359 --> 02:02:49,528
I mean, you're a surfer, right?

02:02:49,570 --> 02:02:51,822
You like cutting it
close to the edge.

02:02:51,864 --> 02:02:55,701
See, when you're
operating out there alone,

02:02:55,743 --> 02:02:57,995
nobody knows the deal but you.

02:02:58,037 --> 02:03:00,873
It's like you're
in your own zone.

02:03:02,041 --> 02:03:05,419
It's like everybody is
sleeping, like zombies.

02:03:05,461 --> 02:03:08,297
I mean sometimes I can even
make them say what I want.

02:03:08,339 --> 02:03:10,716
It's like I'm a step
ahead of everybody.

02:03:10,758 --> 02:03:14,512
- Listen, anything you
can do, I can handle.

02:03:14,553 --> 02:03:15,971
- Can you?
- Sure.

02:03:20,059 --> 02:03:21,936
- It's like a mafia deal.

02:03:21,977 --> 02:03:25,022
It's totally secret,
totally, you got that?

02:03:25,064 --> 02:03:27,817
I mean, it's father son,
just between you and me.

02:03:27,858 --> 02:03:28,692
- Okay.

02:03:30,403 --> 02:03:34,990
- You know, President Kennedy's
father was a bootlegger.

02:03:35,032 --> 02:03:36,534
(laughs)

02:03:36,575 --> 02:03:38,494
You make enough money
and you automatically

02:03:38,536 --> 02:03:40,454
get respectable, right?

02:03:41,539 --> 02:03:44,041
You send your son
to the White House.

02:03:44,083 --> 02:03:45,668
- So what is it you do?

02:03:45,709 --> 02:03:46,877
Come on, Dad.

02:03:47,795 --> 02:03:48,629
- Well.

02:03:49,922 --> 02:03:53,384
Like all great ideas,
it is very simple.

02:03:54,510 --> 02:03:58,305
Continuous access to
classified information.

02:03:58,347 --> 02:03:59,181
That's it.

02:04:00,307 --> 02:04:02,935
I'll teach you
everything I know.

02:04:02,977 --> 02:04:04,854
You can take over the business.

02:04:04,895 --> 02:04:08,357
It's like I said,
you're a natural, kid.

02:04:09,775 --> 02:04:12,111
You can pass it on to your son.

02:04:12,153 --> 02:04:14,029
See I got these people in Europe
that'll pay a lot of money

02:04:14,071 --> 02:04:18,033
for various kinds of
classified information.

02:04:18,075 --> 02:04:20,369
After awhile, I'll
introduce you to them

02:04:20,411 --> 02:04:22,496
and you can run the whole show.

02:04:22,538 --> 02:04:24,123
- The whole show?

02:04:26,417 --> 02:04:27,668
How big is it?

02:04:29,462 --> 02:04:32,006
- As big as you want, Wild Man.

02:04:33,257 --> 02:04:36,510
I've been doing it
for almost 20 years.

02:04:36,552 --> 02:04:40,139
- You've been a spy
for almost 20 years?

02:04:40,181 --> 02:04:40,931
- Yep.

02:04:40,973 --> 02:04:43,476
(gloomy music)

02:05:07,333 --> 02:05:10,169
(waves splashing)

02:05:11,420 --> 02:05:13,589
- [Man] Do you both enter
the contract of marriage

02:05:13,631 --> 02:05:15,382
without any prior commitments

02:05:15,424 --> 02:05:18,093
or reservations of intent?

02:05:18,135 --> 02:05:18,928
Say I do.

02:05:18,969 --> 02:05:20,513
- I do.

02:05:20,554 --> 02:05:21,555
- I do.

02:05:21,597 --> 02:05:23,974
- Now, exchange your rings.

02:05:30,105 --> 02:05:32,316
Pursuant to the
powers invested in me

02:05:32,358 --> 02:05:34,568
by the laws of the
commonwealth of Virginia,

02:05:34,610 --> 02:05:37,279
I pronounce you man and wife.

02:05:37,321 --> 02:05:39,240
You may kiss the bride.

02:05:43,077 --> 02:05:46,205
(audience hollering)

02:05:51,877 --> 02:05:53,504
(yelling)

02:05:53,546 --> 02:05:55,714
(laughs)

02:05:58,551 --> 02:06:00,678
(applause)

02:06:02,304 --> 02:06:03,138
- Oh!

02:06:05,182 --> 02:06:06,058
Great!

02:06:06,100 --> 02:06:08,727
(laughter)

02:06:08,769 --> 02:06:11,522
(sinister music)

02:06:18,529 --> 02:06:18,904
Sailor!

02:06:20,739 --> 02:06:23,200
What are you doing in this room?

02:06:23,242 --> 02:06:25,494
You know it's off limits.

02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:26,370
What are you doing
with those documents?

02:06:26,412 --> 02:06:27,705
They're classified.

02:06:27,746 --> 02:06:28,998
- I was just looking
for that tech manual

02:06:29,039 --> 02:06:31,667
that chief wanted, sir, 11-507A.

02:06:34,753 --> 02:06:36,213
(chuckles)

02:06:36,255 --> 02:06:37,131
- You had eight minutes.

02:06:37,172 --> 02:06:38,507
How many exposures did you get?

02:06:38,549 --> 02:06:40,426
- Seven.
- Seven?

02:06:40,467 --> 02:06:43,304
Ah, you gotta do
better than that.

02:06:44,430 --> 02:06:46,307
I can get 12 in a minute.

02:06:46,348 --> 02:06:47,308
- I...

02:06:47,349 --> 02:06:50,477
I can't concentrate
on the camera.

02:06:50,519 --> 02:06:52,479
All I'm doing is
listening for you.

02:06:52,521 --> 02:06:55,983
- Oh, that's a good
place to start.

02:06:56,025 --> 02:06:57,026
Camera skills will get better.

02:06:57,067 --> 02:06:58,611
Come on, let's try it again.

02:06:58,652 --> 02:06:59,361
(dramatic music)

02:06:59,403 --> 02:07:02,448
(people chattering)

02:07:26,597 --> 02:07:28,849
(banging)

02:07:34,355 --> 02:07:36,482
- What's this door
doing locked, Walker?

02:07:36,523 --> 02:07:37,483
- Uh, sorry, chief.

02:07:37,524 --> 02:07:39,777
I must have locked
it by mistake.

02:07:39,818 --> 02:07:41,320
- [Chief] What the hell are
you doing in here this early?

02:07:41,362 --> 02:07:45,616
- I had to catch up on the
strike ops filing, sir.

02:07:47,534 --> 02:07:49,119
- Don't ever lock
that door again.

02:07:49,161 --> 02:07:51,121
That is a reportable
security violation.

02:07:51,163 --> 02:07:51,914
Do you copy?

02:07:51,955 --> 02:07:53,040
- Aye aye, sir.

02:07:53,082 --> 02:07:55,834
(birds chirping)

02:08:46,427 --> 02:08:47,678
- Would you come see
what that big spender

02:08:47,720 --> 02:08:50,597
gave us for a wedding present?

02:08:50,639 --> 02:08:52,599
Would you look at this?

02:08:53,434 --> 02:08:54,685
Well what does he think we do,

02:08:54,727 --> 02:08:56,520
sit in front of the
TV eating snacks,

02:08:56,562 --> 02:09:00,357
playing switch my
channel like him and Sue?

02:09:04,778 --> 02:09:06,572
Hey, this is, um...

02:09:07,448 --> 02:09:09,658
Security business for my dad.

02:09:09,700 --> 02:09:12,953
You shouldn't get
in my knapsack.

02:09:12,995 --> 02:09:16,331
- These things are all
marked secret, Michael.

02:09:16,373 --> 02:09:18,959
I know what these mean.

02:09:19,001 --> 02:09:23,589
Is this where you've been
getting your money, Michael?

02:09:23,630 --> 02:09:25,841
- Let's just forget it, Rach.

02:09:25,883 --> 02:09:27,342
You just shouldn't get in
my knapsack, that's all.

02:09:27,384 --> 02:09:29,636
- Oh stop it, Michael.

02:09:29,678 --> 02:09:31,930
Just tell me the truth.

02:09:31,972 --> 02:09:33,140
You could get in trouble.

02:09:33,182 --> 02:09:34,475
This is crazy.

02:09:34,516 --> 02:09:35,350
- Okay.

02:09:36,643 --> 02:09:38,729
I can get busted for it.

02:09:38,771 --> 02:09:40,355
It's illegal.

02:09:40,397 --> 02:09:41,356
I'm doing it for my dad.

02:09:41,398 --> 02:09:43,650
It's part of his security work.

02:09:43,692 --> 02:09:46,278
I'm careful, I know
what I'm doing.

02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:48,030
- What in the world is
your father thinking?

02:09:48,071 --> 02:09:49,865
What are you thinking?

02:09:49,907 --> 02:09:52,409
You know how dangerous this is.

02:09:54,036 --> 02:09:56,288
You could go to prison.

02:09:56,330 --> 02:09:57,706
Just promise me, okay?

02:09:57,748 --> 02:09:59,583
Just say that you'll stop.

02:09:59,625 --> 02:10:00,876
- You're wrong.

02:10:00,918 --> 02:10:01,460
- [Rachel] You don't
what you're doing.

02:10:01,502 --> 02:10:02,294
- You're wrong.

02:10:02,336 --> 02:10:03,003
- Just say it.

02:10:03,045 --> 02:10:03,796
- You're wrong.

02:10:03,837 --> 02:10:05,506
Understand, wrong.

02:10:06,381 --> 02:10:09,384
It's okay, it's under control.

02:10:09,426 --> 02:10:12,638
My dad knows how to
take care of things.

02:10:13,847 --> 02:10:15,432
Anyways, I'm finished
with it when I ship out.

02:10:15,474 --> 02:10:17,768
That's the end, period.

02:10:17,810 --> 02:10:20,479
I told Dad already,
so don't worry.

02:10:20,521 --> 02:10:22,022
- I am worried.

02:10:22,064 --> 02:10:22,898
- Rach.

02:10:25,192 --> 02:10:26,151
I love you.

02:10:28,821 --> 02:10:32,449
After this cruise, I'll
get out of the Navy.

02:10:35,285 --> 02:10:37,412
We'll move to California.

02:10:39,414 --> 02:10:41,166
We won't have to think
about this anymore.

02:10:41,208 --> 02:10:44,461
I'm gonna go to
college, get a degree.

02:10:47,256 --> 02:10:49,800
- You sound just like your dad.

02:11:06,275 --> 02:11:08,902
(phone ringing)

02:11:18,704 --> 02:11:19,538
- Hello?

02:11:19,580 --> 02:11:20,497
- [Michael] Mom?

02:11:20,539 --> 02:11:22,457
- Michael, what's the matter?

02:11:22,499 --> 02:11:23,250
What's wrong?

02:11:23,292 --> 02:11:25,085
- Listen, Mom.

02:11:25,127 --> 02:11:27,880
Rachel and I are gonna
buy you a ticket.

02:11:27,921 --> 02:11:31,508
I want you to come down
and visit us for a week.

02:11:31,550 --> 02:11:34,469
We haven't seen you
since we got married.

02:11:34,511 --> 02:11:36,471
- Is something wrong?

02:11:36,513 --> 02:11:37,848
- Nothing, Mom.

02:11:39,433 --> 02:11:41,351
I'm shipping out, that's all.

02:11:41,393 --> 02:11:45,439
The Shiloh's rotating
over the Mediterranean.

02:11:45,480 --> 02:11:49,401
I'm gonna be gone on a
cruise for a long time.

02:11:49,443 --> 02:11:50,277
And...

02:11:51,320 --> 02:11:53,280
I just want to see you.

02:11:54,573 --> 02:11:57,367
- Don't tell your
dad I'm coming, okay?

02:11:57,409 --> 02:11:59,912
- Don't worry, I won't.

02:11:59,953 --> 02:12:02,331
(rumbling)

02:12:03,498 --> 02:12:05,167
- [Woman] Flight
149 to St. Louis

02:12:05,208 --> 02:12:07,294
is now boarding at gate seven.

02:12:07,336 --> 02:12:09,463
Flight 149 to St.
Louis is now boarding--

02:12:09,504 --> 02:12:11,757
- Hi.
- Hi, you look great.

02:12:13,383 --> 02:12:14,384
- Before we go to the apartment,

02:12:14,426 --> 02:12:16,136
I want you to drive me downtown.

02:12:16,178 --> 02:12:17,429
- Where you want to go?

02:12:17,471 --> 02:12:19,473
- No, I don't want
you to get involved.

02:12:19,514 --> 02:12:21,850
I just want to go
downtown, take a cab back.

02:12:21,892 --> 02:12:23,435
- Here, here, here.

02:12:24,978 --> 02:12:28,273
Barbara, where do
you want to go?

02:12:28,315 --> 02:12:30,192
- I'm not gonna let
him hurt Michael.

02:12:30,233 --> 02:12:32,402
- What are you talking about?

02:12:32,444 --> 02:12:35,322
- I'm turning
Johnny into the FBI.

02:12:35,364 --> 02:12:35,739
- What?

02:12:38,075 --> 02:12:38,951
- He's doing something illegal.

02:12:38,992 --> 02:12:40,827
I can't talk about it.

02:12:41,662 --> 02:12:42,871
I gotta do it.

02:12:42,913 --> 02:12:45,040
- Barbara, wait a minute.

02:12:46,708 --> 02:12:48,043
- John's a spy.

02:12:49,586 --> 02:12:51,254
- Oh man.

02:12:51,296 --> 02:12:53,465
- He's been doing business
with the Russians for years,

02:12:53,507 --> 02:12:55,842
since Michael was a little boy.

02:12:55,884 --> 02:12:57,469
- This is crazy, Barbara.

02:12:57,511 --> 02:13:00,973
You don't know this, you don't
know this at all for sure.

02:13:01,014 --> 02:13:02,391
- Of course I do.

02:13:02,432 --> 02:13:04,059
I know everything.

02:13:04,101 --> 02:13:06,478
Why do you think he's been
punishing me for years?

02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:08,563
Why do you think he's
trying to destroy me?

02:13:08,605 --> 02:13:11,650
- Listen, you have to talk
to Michael first, okay?

02:13:11,692 --> 02:13:13,819
Just wait until you
talk to Michael?

02:13:13,860 --> 02:13:14,778
- Why?

02:13:14,820 --> 02:13:16,488
Why do I have to
talk to Michael?

02:13:16,530 --> 02:13:17,447
- You just should.

02:13:17,489 --> 02:13:18,365
- Why?

02:13:18,407 --> 02:13:19,658
Is Michael involved?

02:13:19,700 --> 02:13:20,534
- No.

02:13:21,451 --> 02:13:22,536
No.

02:13:23,620 --> 02:13:24,955
Of course he's not involved.

02:13:24,997 --> 02:13:27,624
I just think that all of this is

02:13:27,666 --> 02:13:30,293
a little too
emotional right now.

02:13:30,335 --> 02:13:34,589
Maybe you need to think it
through with Michael first.

02:13:42,472 --> 02:13:44,057
- [Michael] Hey, Mom, hold on.

02:13:44,099 --> 02:13:45,642
Mom, wait a second.

02:13:48,437 --> 02:13:50,230
- I want to speak
to Johnny Walker.

02:13:50,272 --> 02:13:52,065
- Let me see if he's free.

02:13:52,107 --> 02:13:53,066
Wait, you can't go in there!

02:13:53,108 --> 02:13:55,527
- Don't you touch me.
- Hey!

02:13:56,445 --> 02:13:59,322
- [Secretary] She
can't go in there.

02:14:04,369 --> 02:14:06,455
- You owe me alimony, $10,000.

02:14:06,496 --> 02:14:08,123
I want it right now.

02:14:08,165 --> 02:14:08,832
- Just tone it down,
will you, Barbara?

02:14:08,874 --> 02:14:14,129
- I'm sick of tired of you
nickel-and-diming me to death.

02:14:14,171 --> 02:14:17,758
You've got a lot to pay
for and I want you to pay.

02:14:17,799 --> 02:14:20,010
You don't give me
what you owe me,

02:14:20,052 --> 02:14:22,679
I'm gonna tell everything.

02:14:22,721 --> 02:14:24,306
Understand?

02:14:24,347 --> 02:14:25,515
Everything!

02:14:25,557 --> 02:14:26,892
- Keep it in the room, will you?

02:14:26,933 --> 02:14:28,268
- We've got nothing.

02:14:28,310 --> 02:14:31,229
- You can all take care
of yourselves just fine.

02:14:31,271 --> 02:14:33,648
I don't have that kinda money.

02:14:33,690 --> 02:14:36,109
It's not happening anymore,
Barbara, believe it.

02:14:36,151 --> 02:14:37,611
- You're a liar!

02:14:39,237 --> 02:14:41,239
I know what you're
doing to Laura

02:14:41,281 --> 02:14:43,450
and you are not gonna
do it to Michael.

02:14:43,492 --> 02:14:46,453
- Will you just
shut up and listen?

02:14:47,621 --> 02:14:50,290
You're in this and you know it.

02:14:50,332 --> 02:14:51,792
You want to end up in jail?

02:14:51,833 --> 02:14:53,460
- Jail would be a lot better
than the way I live now

02:14:53,502 --> 02:14:56,463
doing other people's
dirty laundry

02:14:56,505 --> 02:14:58,590
while your girlfriend gets
her nails done every week.

02:14:58,632 --> 02:15:01,718
- Hey, you could be getting
your nails done every week

02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:03,261
if you hadn't screwed it up.

02:15:03,303 --> 02:15:04,721
- I screwed it up?

02:15:06,431 --> 02:15:07,891
I screwed it up?

02:15:12,354 --> 02:15:15,607
If you don't stay away from
Michael, I'm gonna kill you.

02:15:15,649 --> 02:15:16,942
- You better think
about this children

02:15:16,983 --> 02:15:20,278
that you claim to
care so much about.

02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:23,865
You better have a long
talk with Michael.

02:15:23,907 --> 02:15:25,283
Hey!

02:15:25,325 --> 02:15:26,660
Here he is.

02:15:26,701 --> 02:15:28,286
Come talk to him.

02:15:32,541 --> 02:15:33,708
(door slams)

02:15:33,750 --> 02:15:35,961
Mike, she was totally
out of control.

02:15:36,002 --> 02:15:37,295
She was drunk as a skunk.

02:15:37,337 --> 02:15:38,672
Can't you keep her
away from the bottle?

02:15:38,713 --> 02:15:40,632
I mean we got a
real problem here.

02:15:40,674 --> 02:15:42,759
- No, we don't have
a problem, Dad.

02:15:42,801 --> 02:15:44,511
You have a problem.

02:15:44,553 --> 02:15:46,179
She wants a little
respect from you.

02:15:46,221 --> 02:15:47,472
She wants the money you owe her.

02:15:47,514 --> 02:15:48,515
Why don't you just pay her?

02:15:48,557 --> 02:15:50,308
- Paying the money's
not the point.

02:15:50,350 --> 02:15:51,935
You gotta tell her
you're involved with me.

02:15:51,977 --> 02:15:53,145
If she knows you're in it,

02:15:53,186 --> 02:15:54,437
she's not gonna go
shooting her mouth off.

02:15:54,479 --> 02:15:55,021
But you gotta tell her.

02:15:55,021 --> 02:15:57,107
She's not gonna believe
me if I tell her.

02:15:57,149 --> 02:15:58,108
- No way.

02:15:58,150 --> 02:15:59,401
No way, I can't, Dad.

02:15:59,442 --> 02:16:01,444
She'll kill herself
if I tell her

02:16:01,486 --> 02:16:03,780
and you can't tell her
either, promise me.

02:16:03,822 --> 02:16:05,365
- Your mother is not
gonna kill herself.

02:16:05,407 --> 02:16:07,325
There's too much left to drink.

02:16:07,367 --> 02:16:09,119
You gotta tell her
before you ship out.

02:16:09,161 --> 02:16:10,245
Just think of it
as family business

02:16:10,287 --> 02:16:12,539
and take care of it, Mike.

02:16:18,420 --> 02:16:19,504
Look.

02:16:22,340 --> 02:16:24,676
You'll go to prison
too if she talks.

02:16:24,718 --> 02:16:26,386
Believe it.

02:16:26,428 --> 02:16:29,764
They'll throw away
the key on both of us.

02:16:32,893 --> 02:16:35,145
It's got to come from you.

02:16:37,898 --> 02:16:40,442
Just tell her and we can relax.

02:16:41,443 --> 02:16:43,778
Make it your top priority, huh?

02:16:43,820 --> 02:16:46,865
(upbeat band music)

02:16:52,329 --> 02:16:53,747
- Hey, Jimmy!

02:16:53,788 --> 02:16:55,874
Jimmy, take a picture of us.

02:16:55,916 --> 02:16:57,459
Come on, Ma.

02:16:57,500 --> 02:16:58,418
Come on.

02:16:58,460 --> 02:17:00,837
Come on, let's take a pic.

02:17:00,879 --> 02:17:02,130
Thanks, carney.

02:17:02,172 --> 02:17:03,381
- Hey, let me get
one of you guys.

02:17:03,423 --> 02:17:05,425
- [Man] Now hear
this, now hear this.

02:17:05,467 --> 02:17:08,345
Make all preparations
for departing port.

02:17:08,386 --> 02:17:12,766
All visitors must depart
the ship in five minutes.

02:17:12,807 --> 02:17:13,642
- Mom.

02:17:15,393 --> 02:17:16,811
- Just...

02:17:16,853 --> 02:17:18,855
I just want you to be careful.

02:17:18,897 --> 02:17:21,149
- I'm always careful, Mom.

02:17:21,191 --> 02:17:25,070
I just want to get in
some surfing and uh,

02:17:25,111 --> 02:17:28,490
Rachel's saving to
come over this summer.

02:17:28,531 --> 02:17:30,367
It'll be great.

02:17:30,408 --> 02:17:32,202
- [Man] Now hear this, on deck,

02:17:32,244 --> 02:17:34,996
set to sea and anchor detail.

02:17:35,038 --> 02:17:36,081
- Look, Mom.

02:17:37,499 --> 02:17:41,419
You haven't talked to
anybody about Dad, have you?

02:17:41,461 --> 02:17:43,088
- Did he tell you to say that?

02:17:43,129 --> 02:17:43,964
- No, Mom.

02:17:44,756 --> 02:17:46,508
I can think for myself.

02:17:46,549 --> 02:17:48,718
- Michael, are you
working for him?

02:17:48,760 --> 02:17:50,011
- No way, Mom.

02:17:52,347 --> 02:17:53,848
No way.

02:17:53,890 --> 02:17:55,517
- Please don't lie to me.

02:17:55,558 --> 02:17:57,519
- I'm not lying, Mom.

02:17:59,729 --> 02:18:02,565
I wouldn't do that to you.

02:18:02,607 --> 02:18:05,986
Not after what you've
been put through.

02:18:06,861 --> 02:18:08,571
God, I love you, Mom.

02:18:10,532 --> 02:18:12,742
I love you more than anyone.

02:18:14,160 --> 02:18:15,078
- Love you.

02:18:18,456 --> 02:18:19,708
- Hey, sailor.

02:18:23,044 --> 02:18:25,505
You got one of those for me?

02:18:34,180 --> 02:18:37,434
You be good until Naples, okay?

02:18:37,475 --> 02:18:38,893
- Aye aye, doctor.

02:18:50,947 --> 02:18:53,450
(gloomy music)

02:19:06,171 --> 02:19:07,589
- Walker.
- Chief.

02:19:09,090 --> 02:19:11,343
(humming)

02:19:25,023 --> 02:19:26,483
- Little early for that, Walker?

02:19:26,524 --> 02:19:28,109
- Uh, no, chief.

02:19:28,151 --> 02:19:30,779
We're on a double burn schedule.

02:19:45,377 --> 02:19:47,796
- I need a runner on
this op order, chief.

02:19:47,837 --> 02:19:48,922
Where's Walker?

02:19:48,963 --> 02:19:50,465
- I think he's
processing a burn, sir.

02:19:50,507 --> 02:19:51,508
He'll be in the fan
room, want me to get him?

02:19:51,549 --> 02:19:52,926
- I'll get him.

02:19:54,844 --> 02:19:57,263
Walker, what the hell you doing?

02:19:57,305 --> 02:20:00,475
- I threw away a message
I should have filed, sir.

02:20:00,517 --> 02:20:01,893
I'm just looking for it.

02:20:01,935 --> 02:20:03,520
- Okay, uh, when
you're finished,

02:20:03,561 --> 02:20:05,897
I got an op order I want you
to run up the line for me.

02:20:05,939 --> 02:20:07,690
- [Michael] Yes, sir.

02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:16,032
- Hello, Wild Man,
this is Tiger Breath.

02:20:16,074 --> 02:20:19,411
It's Thursday, I just got
your first letter today.

02:20:19,452 --> 02:20:21,663
Things seem to be
going good for you.

02:20:21,704 --> 02:20:24,374
Can't wait to see those photos.

02:20:24,416 --> 02:20:28,002
Sounds like you've
got your act together.

02:20:29,212 --> 02:20:31,589
I called Rachel today.

02:20:31,631 --> 02:20:34,509
She's working her buns off
trying to make some extra cash

02:20:34,551 --> 02:20:36,594
for that trip to Europe.

02:20:37,512 --> 02:20:40,974
I have to visit you
in Naples in July.

02:20:41,015 --> 02:20:44,310
We can check out
the scene together.

02:20:44,352 --> 02:20:45,520
It'll be fun, huh?

02:20:45,562 --> 02:20:48,314
(solemn music)

02:21:14,090 --> 02:21:15,550
- Yes.

02:21:15,592 --> 02:21:17,635
I'd like the number of the FBI.

02:21:17,677 --> 02:21:19,971
(phone ringing)

02:21:20,013 --> 02:21:22,432
- FBI, Price speaking.

02:21:22,474 --> 02:21:25,018
- I want to report something.

02:21:26,436 --> 02:21:30,356
I want you to know my
ex-husband is a spy

02:21:30,398 --> 02:21:31,691
for the Russians.

02:21:33,902 --> 02:21:36,863
He's been a spy for 20 years.

02:21:36,905 --> 02:21:39,449
My husband hid his
photographs at the drop sites

02:21:39,491 --> 02:21:43,578
and, uh, they were
outside Washington, D.C.

02:21:43,620 --> 02:21:46,998
He took me with him on
several of those drops.

02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:48,708
- What happened?

02:21:48,750 --> 02:21:51,336
Describe the procedure for me.

02:21:51,377 --> 02:21:53,421
- Well, he had um,

02:21:53,463 --> 02:21:56,382
he had film cassettes that uh...

02:21:56,424 --> 02:21:56,925
That um...

02:21:59,344 --> 02:22:02,430
He would put in regular
plastic trash bags

02:22:02,472 --> 02:22:05,934
and he would take these
bags to the bushes and um,

02:22:05,975 --> 02:22:08,520
put them in his spot
and mark them with uh,

02:22:08,561 --> 02:22:10,021
soft drink cans.

02:22:12,649 --> 02:22:13,525
Would you excuse me?

02:22:13,566 --> 02:22:16,486
I uh, I have to get some ice.

02:22:16,528 --> 02:22:17,612
Thank you.

02:22:33,253 --> 02:22:36,548
About a half an hour
later he would um,

02:22:36,589 --> 02:22:39,133
drive to another spot and um,

02:22:40,385 --> 02:22:44,472
pick up another trash bag and
inside the trash was money.

02:22:45,515 --> 02:22:47,100
- How much money?

02:22:48,476 --> 02:22:52,397
- Maybe uh, one time I
remember it was over $50,000.

02:22:53,565 --> 02:22:55,108
That was just in the beginning.

02:22:55,149 --> 02:22:58,820
I mean, I'm sure that
there's a lot more later.

02:22:58,861 --> 02:23:00,530
- How long ago did this happen?

02:23:00,572 --> 02:23:04,033
- I figured it out,
I think it was 1967.

02:23:05,910 --> 02:23:07,287
- 17 years ago?

02:23:09,163 --> 02:23:12,375
When did you and
your husband divorce?

02:23:12,417 --> 02:23:14,460
- I don't see what
that has to do with it,

02:23:14,502 --> 02:23:18,381
but we were uh, we were
divorced eight years ago.

02:23:21,718 --> 02:23:25,096
- All this happened while you
were married for nine years?

02:23:25,138 --> 02:23:28,474
Do you have any evidence
of more recent activity?

02:23:28,516 --> 02:23:30,685
Other contacts in the Navy?

02:23:30,727 --> 02:23:33,479
- Well I thought that's what
you were supposed to find out.

02:23:33,521 --> 02:23:34,397
I mean, um...

02:23:36,149 --> 02:23:36,983
Uh...

02:23:37,942 --> 02:23:39,652
(sighs)

02:23:39,694 --> 02:23:40,987
Yeah.

02:23:41,029 --> 02:23:42,405
There was um...

02:23:43,531 --> 02:23:46,367
There was this guy named uh...

02:23:46,409 --> 02:23:47,243
Um...

02:23:48,536 --> 02:23:50,496
Jerry Whitman, Whitson.

02:23:51,331 --> 02:23:53,207
I don't know,
something like that.

02:23:53,249 --> 02:23:54,083
I...

02:23:55,001 --> 02:23:56,336
Uh...

02:23:56,377 --> 02:23:58,588
He's out in California.

02:23:59,547 --> 02:24:01,382
Johnny spent a lot
of time with him.

02:24:01,424 --> 02:24:03,468
- How long ago was that?

02:24:05,928 --> 02:24:06,763
- Look.

02:24:08,640 --> 02:24:10,391
What if I brought
somebody else in here

02:24:10,433 --> 02:24:12,352
to testify to all this?

02:24:13,561 --> 02:24:16,230
What if my daughter
Laura told you

02:24:16,272 --> 02:24:21,069
about the times that he tried
to recruit her as a spy?

02:24:21,110 --> 02:24:25,406
- Well, that would
corroborate your story.

02:24:25,448 --> 02:24:26,282
But...

02:24:28,493 --> 02:24:31,079
What does your husband do now?

02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:34,332
- He's living in our
old family house.

02:24:35,500 --> 02:24:39,379
He's a private investigator
in Norfolk, Virginia.

02:24:41,130 --> 02:24:43,591
- Okay, that's it for today.

02:24:44,509 --> 02:24:46,469
Not unless anybody's
got anything else.

02:24:46,511 --> 02:24:48,179
- We oughta run
through the crazy file

02:24:48,221 --> 02:24:50,181
just to keep
Rafferty off our ass.

02:24:50,223 --> 02:24:52,266
- [Man] Just read the
headings for me, Rafferty.

02:24:52,308 --> 02:24:53,309
Let's expedite.

02:24:53,351 --> 02:24:54,352
- All right.

02:24:54,394 --> 02:24:56,854
(phone ringing)

02:24:56,896 --> 02:24:57,730
Let's see.

02:25:02,402 --> 02:25:05,738
I got a 3/4 disability
Korean war vet

02:25:05,780 --> 02:25:07,949
who hears radio henoy
on his dentures.

02:25:07,990 --> 02:25:10,827
- I could use a pair that tune
in the golden oldies station.

02:25:10,868 --> 02:25:12,328
- Yeah, here's a good one.

02:25:12,370 --> 02:25:14,497
I got a film projectionist
out in Cambridge.

02:25:14,539 --> 02:25:17,041
He thinks the martians
are doctoring the popcorn.

02:25:17,083 --> 02:25:18,501
- Probably not the martians.

02:25:18,543 --> 02:25:22,338
- Here's a woman,
alcoholic, clothes washer.

02:25:22,380 --> 02:25:25,717
She thinks that her
ex-husband who's a private eye

02:25:25,758 --> 02:25:28,052
is the head of a major
Russian spy ring.

02:25:28,094 --> 02:25:29,178
- You're getting
better, Rafferty.

02:25:29,220 --> 02:25:31,139
Let's see that.

02:25:31,180 --> 02:25:35,435
Probably just renegotiating
her divorce settlement.

02:25:38,146 --> 02:25:40,189
She doesn't like her husband.

02:25:40,231 --> 02:25:42,650
But she's got lots of details.

02:25:43,609 --> 02:25:46,738
Details are the key, Rafferty.

02:25:46,779 --> 02:25:48,364
Now write up a summary of that

02:25:48,406 --> 02:25:50,283
and send it to counter
it, Washington.

02:25:50,324 --> 02:25:52,160
Put in all the detail.

02:25:52,201 --> 02:25:53,578
Cut down on the drinking part.

02:25:53,619 --> 02:25:56,581
(dramatic music)

02:25:56,622 --> 02:25:58,207
- I'm inquiring about
the investigation

02:25:58,249 --> 02:26:00,168
of Jonathan Walker, Jr.

02:26:01,252 --> 02:26:02,503
Walker.

02:26:02,545 --> 02:26:03,045
Yes, it's been two months now

02:26:03,045 --> 02:26:05,923
since my mother last
called your office

02:26:05,965 --> 02:26:08,468
and I don't understand why
it's taking you this long.

02:26:08,509 --> 02:26:10,094
- These activities
your mother described

02:26:10,136 --> 02:26:11,596
happened a long time ago.

02:26:11,637 --> 02:26:12,972
They aren't a top priority.

02:26:13,014 --> 02:26:13,890
- He's a spy.

02:26:13,931 --> 02:26:15,224
He's a traitor.

02:26:15,266 --> 02:26:17,393
He's tried to get
me into it a lot.

02:26:17,435 --> 02:26:20,104
I could call him on the phone
and he'd do it right now.

02:26:20,146 --> 02:26:22,982
(engine rumbling)

02:26:33,493 --> 02:26:34,911
- [Man] I see the
Bureau's oil pans

02:26:34,952 --> 02:26:36,454
are up to the usual standards.

02:26:36,496 --> 02:26:40,291
- Oh, I got an air tail
on this from Boston.

02:26:40,333 --> 02:26:41,626
We're going to have to
think this one through

02:26:41,667 --> 02:26:42,543
pretty carefully.

02:26:42,585 --> 02:26:44,045
It's got that feel for me.

02:26:44,086 --> 02:26:45,338
- Well let's locate him first

02:26:45,379 --> 02:26:48,257
and I'll work out a
surveillance plan.

02:26:49,258 --> 02:26:52,094
- You know, everything she says,

02:26:52,136 --> 02:26:55,306
it's custom KGB trade pat, Bob.

02:26:55,348 --> 02:26:58,434
Trash bags, soft
drink cans, $50 bills.

02:26:58,476 --> 02:27:00,186
- We need a name for this file.

02:27:00,228 --> 02:27:02,480
- How about Family Affair?

02:27:03,356 --> 02:27:06,901
No, that's a little
too close for security.

02:27:06,943 --> 02:27:08,528
I had a horse out
in Buey last week,

02:27:08,569 --> 02:27:11,197
I can't get the
name out of my head.

02:27:11,239 --> 02:27:12,198
Wind Flyer.

02:27:12,949 --> 02:27:13,741
- How'd he run?

02:27:13,783 --> 02:27:16,410
- In the money and big.

02:27:16,452 --> 02:27:19,288
- [Bob] Let's hope
you like colts.

02:27:20,498 --> 02:27:22,416
- Did your father ever
attempt to recruit you

02:27:22,458 --> 02:27:24,210
in his espionage operation?

02:27:24,252 --> 02:27:27,505
- Yes, he did, several times.

02:27:27,547 --> 02:27:30,550
- Did you subsequently deliver
any such documents to him?

02:27:30,591 --> 02:27:32,969
- [Laura] No, I did not.

02:27:33,010 --> 02:27:34,262
- To the best of your knowledge,

02:27:34,303 --> 02:27:36,305
is your father still
engaged in espionage?

02:27:36,347 --> 02:27:37,431
- Yes.

02:27:38,015 --> 02:27:42,186
With a man named Jerry
Wentworth in California.

02:27:42,228 --> 02:27:43,980
- Your daughter named an
associate of your husband

02:27:44,021 --> 02:27:45,398
named Jerry Wentworth.

02:27:45,439 --> 02:27:46,983
Do you recognize this name?

02:27:47,024 --> 02:27:48,776
- It's Whitworth.

02:27:48,818 --> 02:27:51,362
It's Jerry Whitworth.

02:27:51,404 --> 02:27:52,446
He's married now.

02:27:52,488 --> 02:27:54,532
They live in California.

02:27:55,449 --> 02:27:58,452
He used to be in the
Navy with Johnny.

02:27:58,494 --> 02:28:00,872
I think he's still in the Navy.

02:28:00,913 --> 02:28:02,290
- Do you have reason to
believe your brother-in-law

02:28:02,331 --> 02:28:05,710
Arthur Walker is
involved in espionage?

02:28:06,836 --> 02:28:07,962
- Arthur's...

02:28:09,046 --> 02:28:10,006
A weak man.

02:28:10,840 --> 02:28:12,508
And John controls him.

02:28:12,550 --> 02:28:14,468
- Do you have reason to
believe your son Michael Walker

02:28:14,510 --> 02:28:16,387
is involved in espionage?

02:28:16,429 --> 02:28:19,390
- No, I know he's
not a part of it.

02:28:21,392 --> 02:28:24,145
I warned him that
his dad was a spy

02:28:24,186 --> 02:28:26,856
when he went into the Navy.

02:28:26,898 --> 02:28:30,568
I asked him if he was
working for his dad.

02:28:31,527 --> 02:28:33,195
He said he wasn't.

02:28:36,198 --> 02:28:37,909
He doesn't lie to me.

02:28:40,578 --> 02:28:42,413
(phone ringing)

02:28:42,455 --> 02:28:43,289
- Yeah?

02:28:44,707 --> 02:28:47,376
Oh yeah, what do you got, Bob?

02:28:48,169 --> 02:28:49,462
Yeah.

02:28:49,503 --> 02:28:52,673
We better alert the Fresco
office about this guy.

02:28:52,715 --> 02:28:53,966
Spell it.

02:28:54,008 --> 02:28:57,720
- W-H-I-T-W-O-R-T-H,
Whitworth, Jerry.

02:28:57,762 --> 02:28:59,096
And listen to this.

02:28:59,138 --> 02:29:01,641
Michael, the son,
he's in the Navy.

02:29:01,682 --> 02:29:04,602
Active duty at sea, USS Shiloh.

02:29:04,644 --> 02:29:07,104
(whooshing)

02:29:11,275 --> 02:29:13,402
(clanging)

02:29:51,107 --> 02:29:53,943
(camera clicking)

02:29:58,364 --> 02:29:59,198
- Because!

02:30:04,328 --> 02:30:08,666
- Doesn't look as if he has
a care in the world, does he?

02:30:08,708 --> 02:30:11,961
- [John] Don't do
that, don't do that.

02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:15,172
(giggles)

02:30:19,885 --> 02:30:21,512
- [Man] Print out their
full service record,

02:30:21,554 --> 02:30:23,431
all possible intersects.

02:30:23,472 --> 02:30:25,975
- Keying in Walker's Navy
record and Whitworth's.

02:30:26,017 --> 02:30:27,476
Now I'll punch in the
correlation search mode

02:30:27,518 --> 02:30:28,436
and let's see what we've got.

02:30:28,477 --> 02:30:30,813
(beeping)

02:30:33,065 --> 02:30:34,316
- Looks like between
these two guys,

02:30:34,358 --> 02:30:36,986
the Russians bought the store.

02:30:37,028 --> 02:30:39,071
- Now punch in the
son, Michael L. Walker,

02:30:39,113 --> 02:30:41,532
United States Navy active duty.

02:30:41,574 --> 02:30:42,825
- Between the three of them,

02:30:42,867 --> 02:30:44,368
they've been on every
class of submarine,

02:30:44,410 --> 02:30:47,538
carrier and communications
command in the US Navy.

02:30:47,580 --> 02:30:49,957
- [Michael] I'm getting
so many souvenirs for you.

02:30:49,999 --> 02:30:52,460
At the rate I'm going,
I'll have over 100 pounds.

02:30:52,501 --> 02:30:53,794
Two big boxes.

02:30:53,836 --> 02:30:55,087
I'm running out of
space and looking

02:30:55,129 --> 02:30:56,547
for a little advice here.

02:30:56,589 --> 02:30:58,924
I feel like I'm
out in left field.

02:30:58,966 --> 02:31:00,926
What's the situation with Mom?

02:31:00,968 --> 02:31:02,470
Rachel wrote that she's
calling her again.

02:31:02,511 --> 02:31:04,221
She's mad about the money.

02:31:04,263 --> 02:31:08,517
I get the feeling that
something is going to happen.

02:31:18,069 --> 02:31:20,279
- What are you worried about?

02:31:20,321 --> 02:31:23,991
You told her you're
working for me, right?

02:31:28,412 --> 02:31:29,747
Next transmission,

02:31:29,789 --> 02:31:33,167
I want to know exactly
what you said to her.

02:31:35,336 --> 02:31:36,420
Exactly.

02:31:42,760 --> 02:31:45,012
I'm gonna call her
myself right now.

02:31:45,054 --> 02:31:46,305
Listen to this.

02:31:46,347 --> 02:31:48,891
I'll tell her myself in person.

02:31:51,685 --> 02:31:52,645
- [Barbara] Hello?

02:31:52,686 --> 02:31:55,481
- [John] Barbara, it's John.

02:31:55,523 --> 02:31:56,774
Listen, I've got to talk to you.

02:31:56,816 --> 02:31:58,526
I'm gonna send you
a plane ticket.

02:31:58,567 --> 02:32:00,152
You could fly down to
Norfolk for Easter,

02:32:00,194 --> 02:32:01,654
visit Rachel and Laura.

02:32:01,695 --> 02:32:04,156
- [Barbara] I don't know
if I can get off from work.

02:32:04,198 --> 02:32:05,491
- [John] You want $10,000?

02:32:05,533 --> 02:32:07,159
Make a little effort, right?

02:32:07,201 --> 02:32:09,161
We've got things to discuss.

02:32:09,203 --> 02:32:12,206
We can't do it on the phone.

02:32:12,248 --> 02:32:14,583
- Now we got a real
control problem here.

02:32:14,625 --> 02:32:16,377
Barbara is a heavy drinker.

02:32:16,418 --> 02:32:19,004
Walker is suspicious and
he's a trained investigator.

02:32:19,046 --> 02:32:20,381
He'll take her apart.

02:32:20,422 --> 02:32:21,674
He'll give her a couple
drinks, she'll get mad,

02:32:21,715 --> 02:32:23,259
tell him that the jig is up,

02:32:23,300 --> 02:32:25,302
he'll go get on an airplane,
fly down to the Bahamas.

02:32:25,344 --> 02:32:27,513
- Have her postpone
the meeting, stall him,

02:32:27,555 --> 02:32:28,222
tell him she can't make it now.

02:32:28,264 --> 02:32:30,850
- No way, she's been after
him for months on this money.

02:32:30,891 --> 02:32:32,351
If she backs off now,

02:32:32,393 --> 02:32:34,395
he'll know for sure
that she's reported him.

02:32:34,436 --> 02:32:35,563
She's gotta go through with it.

02:32:35,604 --> 02:32:36,480
- You spoke to her last.

02:32:36,522 --> 02:32:37,314
What did you think, Bev?

02:32:37,356 --> 02:32:38,899
- She's scared.

02:32:38,941 --> 02:32:40,651
She told me that if he gets
angry, he can hurt her.

02:32:40,693 --> 02:32:41,986
He's done it before.

02:32:42,027 --> 02:32:43,737
But she'll do it if
we can protect her.

02:32:43,779 --> 02:32:45,030
- This guy's security-conscious

02:32:45,072 --> 02:32:46,490
plus he doesn't
talk on the phone.

02:32:46,532 --> 02:32:48,033
We can't risk a
tracer on his van.

02:32:48,075 --> 02:32:49,618
He checks it out
before each trip.

02:32:49,660 --> 02:32:51,036
He uses counter
tailing procedures

02:32:51,078 --> 02:32:52,413
every time he leaves the house.

02:32:52,454 --> 02:32:54,206
We can't risk giving
her protection.

02:32:54,248 --> 02:32:55,374
She's gotta know that.

02:32:55,416 --> 02:32:58,210
(gloomy music)

02:33:14,685 --> 02:33:17,438
(gentle music)

02:33:18,772 --> 02:33:20,357
- You know something, Mom?

02:33:20,399 --> 02:33:21,650
The way you're fixing
up for this date,

02:33:21,692 --> 02:33:24,737
it's almost like
you still love Dad.

02:33:51,639 --> 02:33:54,391
(engine rumbles)

02:34:32,846 --> 02:34:36,267
(suspenseful music)

02:34:36,308 --> 02:34:38,602
(horn honks)

02:34:56,954 --> 02:34:59,999
(people chattering)

02:35:06,922 --> 02:35:09,341
- You bring all your girls
to this classy joint?

02:35:09,383 --> 02:35:10,801
(chuckles)

02:35:10,843 --> 02:35:13,679
- Everybody thinks I'm rich.

02:35:13,721 --> 02:35:16,473
I mean this whole family thinks
I just reach into my pockets

02:35:16,515 --> 02:35:19,476
and I'm gonna solve
all their problems.

02:35:19,518 --> 02:35:22,313
I'm not making that
kind of money anymore.

02:35:22,354 --> 02:35:23,480
I wish I was.

02:35:25,316 --> 02:35:28,319
- Since when did you
start talking cheap?

02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:28,861
Don't you want your new girl

02:35:28,861 --> 02:35:31,071
to find out how much
money you've got?

02:35:31,113 --> 02:35:32,906
- If I hadn't had to get out
of the Navy because of you,

02:35:32,948 --> 02:35:36,410
I'd have made a
million dollars by now.

02:35:36,452 --> 02:35:39,330
Now that's how much you cost me.

02:35:40,581 --> 02:35:42,166
- You didn't bring me
all the way down here

02:35:42,207 --> 02:35:46,462
for this big dinner just to
tell me how broke you are.

02:35:49,548 --> 02:35:52,384
- Maybe I just wanted
to see you again.

02:35:52,426 --> 02:35:53,260
- Right.

02:35:58,599 --> 02:35:59,516
- I guess you had a little talk

02:35:59,558 --> 02:36:02,227
with Mike before he left, huh?

02:36:02,269 --> 02:36:02,936
- I talked to Michael.

02:36:02,978 --> 02:36:05,314
- So now you're not gonna be
wanting to talk to the FBI.

02:36:05,356 --> 02:36:06,357
Are you?

02:36:06,398 --> 02:36:07,941
- What are you saying?

02:36:07,983 --> 02:36:09,777
Are you saying
Michael's involved?

02:36:09,818 --> 02:36:11,612
- Involved in what?

02:36:13,405 --> 02:36:15,074
I told you I'm not
doing that anymore.

02:36:15,115 --> 02:36:17,743
Look, all I'm saying is that uh,

02:36:19,203 --> 02:36:21,288
if you go talking about me
you're gonna ruin his chances

02:36:21,330 --> 02:36:22,998
for advanced clearance
and his promotion.

02:36:23,040 --> 02:36:24,500
You don't want to do
that to him, do you?

02:36:24,541 --> 02:36:27,586
- Is Michael working
for you or not?

02:36:32,383 --> 02:36:33,467
Yes or no?

02:36:35,511 --> 02:36:37,554
He'd never work for you.

02:36:38,430 --> 02:36:39,390
I know him.

02:36:40,766 --> 02:36:42,810
He'd never work for you.

02:36:51,485 --> 02:36:54,363
- You know, you're
looking beautiful tonight.

02:36:54,405 --> 02:36:56,156
What are you so uptight about?

02:36:56,198 --> 02:36:58,951
You're not afraid
of me, are you?

02:36:58,992 --> 02:36:59,827
- No.

02:37:09,002 --> 02:37:13,424
- You haven't flapped your
mouth about me, have you, Barb?

02:37:13,465 --> 02:37:14,550
- No.

02:37:15,342 --> 02:37:16,427
No.

02:37:17,511 --> 02:37:19,346
Of course not, I
couldn't do that.

02:37:19,388 --> 02:37:21,306
I don't have the nerve.

02:37:22,599 --> 02:37:24,476
You know me, Johnny.

02:37:27,187 --> 02:37:28,397
- You know, I...

02:37:29,773 --> 02:37:32,901
I'd really like for
us to be friends.

02:37:33,986 --> 02:37:35,028
After all...

02:37:37,489 --> 02:37:39,616
We'll never be separated.

02:37:40,868 --> 02:37:43,412
We have kids together, right?

02:38:12,232 --> 02:38:13,066
Oh.

02:38:16,987 --> 02:38:18,447
This is for you.

02:38:29,291 --> 02:38:30,334
- Thank you.

02:38:43,222 --> 02:38:45,974
(car door slams)

02:38:52,231 --> 02:38:54,983
(engine rumbles)

02:39:00,447 --> 02:39:02,241
(dramatic chord)

02:39:02,282 --> 02:39:03,742
(solemn music)

02:39:03,784 --> 02:39:05,744
(sobs)

02:39:34,773 --> 02:39:36,441
- Jerry's not gonna
make it on his own.

02:39:36,483 --> 02:39:37,609
I'll give him two years max.

02:39:37,651 --> 02:39:40,404
His wife ain't
gonna support him.

02:39:43,323 --> 02:39:46,827
(phone ringing)

02:39:46,868 --> 02:39:47,619
Hello?

02:39:47,661 --> 02:39:48,537
- [Art] Johnny?

02:39:48,579 --> 02:39:50,038
- [John] Hi, bubba, what's up?

02:39:50,080 --> 02:39:52,165
- [Art] Listen, I've
got some bad news.

02:39:52,207 --> 02:39:53,584
Aunt Amelia died.

02:39:53,625 --> 02:39:55,669
They're having the
funeral on Sunday.

02:39:55,711 --> 02:39:57,170
I know you're real close to her.

02:39:57,212 --> 02:39:57,754
She practically raised you.

02:39:57,796 --> 02:40:00,966
So Mom and I figured
you'd want to be there.

02:40:01,008 --> 02:40:02,509
(sighs)

02:40:02,551 --> 02:40:03,385
- Yeah.

02:40:04,595 --> 02:40:05,846
I really should come.

02:40:05,887 --> 02:40:08,765
She was my favorite, I just...

02:40:08,807 --> 02:40:09,182
I can't.

02:40:11,560 --> 02:40:12,477
I got this meeting out of town.

02:40:12,519 --> 02:40:13,604
It's...

02:40:15,480 --> 02:40:17,232
- [Art] Can't you change it?

02:40:17,274 --> 02:40:19,610
- No, no, it's locked in.

02:40:19,651 --> 02:40:22,946
It can't be changed on
this short of notice.

02:40:22,988 --> 02:40:26,700
Can't they change the date
till Monday or something?

02:40:26,742 --> 02:40:28,285
- [Art] Johnny, be serious.

02:40:28,327 --> 02:40:29,911
There's a lot of
relatives coming.

02:40:29,953 --> 02:40:31,663
Arrangements have been
made, stuff like that.

02:40:31,705 --> 02:40:33,373
- She was a great lady.

02:40:33,415 --> 02:40:35,083
- [Art] Nobody will
change that now.

02:40:35,125 --> 02:40:36,460
They can't.

02:40:36,501 --> 02:40:38,420
You gotta come, Johnny.

02:40:40,964 --> 02:40:42,382
- I, I just can't.

02:40:45,052 --> 02:40:47,346
- [Art] Can't you
send someone else?

02:40:47,387 --> 02:40:48,722
- No.

02:40:48,764 --> 02:40:50,015
Look, it's business.

02:40:50,057 --> 02:40:51,892
Nobody else can take
care of it but me.

02:40:51,933 --> 02:40:53,435
- [Art] Well, just postpone it.

02:40:53,477 --> 02:40:55,687
- No, it can't be postponed.

02:40:57,272 --> 02:41:00,859
- [Art] Listen,
Johnny, this is family.

02:41:00,901 --> 02:41:02,986
- Look, bubba, please.

02:41:03,028 --> 02:41:05,322
Any other day, you
know I would be there.

02:41:05,364 --> 02:41:07,366
Any other day but Sunday, I--

02:41:07,407 --> 02:41:11,453
- [Art] Mom's gonna be
real unhappy about this.

02:41:11,495 --> 02:41:13,372
- I'll send flowers.

02:41:13,413 --> 02:41:15,957
- [Art] All right, Johnny.

02:41:15,999 --> 02:41:17,501
- I'm sorry.

02:41:17,542 --> 02:41:20,295
(birds chirping)

02:41:21,546 --> 02:41:25,175
(speaking foreign language)

02:41:27,344 --> 02:41:30,138
(engine rumbling)

02:41:33,225 --> 02:41:35,769
(tires squeal)

02:41:38,563 --> 02:41:40,524
- [Man] Windflower one,
this is Windflower five.

02:41:40,565 --> 02:41:44,569
I have target vehicle heading
north on interstate 95, over.

02:41:46,279 --> 02:41:49,324
(gentle jazz music)

02:42:07,342 --> 02:42:09,553
- Windflower Net,
this is Windflower one

02:42:09,594 --> 02:42:12,222
proceeding to special
surveillance center.

02:42:12,264 --> 02:42:14,474
Maintain maximum
tracking distance.

02:42:14,516 --> 02:42:17,310
Aircraft will maintain contact.

02:42:21,732 --> 02:42:23,150
- [Man] This is Windflower five.

02:42:23,191 --> 02:42:26,027
Target vehicle has
taken exit 23, over.

02:42:26,069 --> 02:42:29,281
(birds chirping)

02:42:29,322 --> 02:42:32,284
- [Woman] He's heading north
on Prince and Orchard Row.

02:42:32,325 --> 02:42:33,326
- [Man] This may be a dry run.

02:42:33,368 --> 02:42:36,538
We don't want to
saturate the area.

02:42:39,666 --> 02:42:41,293
- Attention Windflower Net.

02:42:41,334 --> 02:42:45,046
Russian diplomat plate
DSX144 entering drop area.

02:42:45,088 --> 02:42:47,591
(gloomy music)

02:43:30,467 --> 02:43:33,470
(engine rumbling)

02:43:54,908 --> 02:43:57,536
(brakes squeal)

02:43:58,787 --> 02:44:01,039
(yelling)

02:44:01,873 --> 02:44:03,917
- Here it is, over here!

02:44:08,421 --> 02:44:09,923
I got it, I got it!

02:44:13,426 --> 02:44:14,678
- No film.

02:44:14,719 --> 02:44:15,971
- [Man] Clear out,
they're coming.

02:44:16,012 --> 02:44:16,721
- Okay, clear it
out, clear it out!

02:44:16,763 --> 02:44:18,598
Let's move it, quickly!

02:44:19,474 --> 02:44:20,934
- [Man] Come on!

02:44:34,239 --> 02:44:38,201
- Sedan DXX144 turning
onto Prince Orchard Row.

02:44:57,053 --> 02:44:59,180
- What the hell happened?

02:45:02,225 --> 02:45:04,477
- The reason that he didn't stop

02:45:04,519 --> 02:45:06,855
is they picked up his signal.

02:45:06,897 --> 02:45:09,399
That was a 7 Up can.

02:45:09,441 --> 02:45:13,445
The Russian thought that he
missed the drop and went on by.

02:45:15,780 --> 02:45:17,240
- Where's Walker right now?

02:45:17,282 --> 02:45:19,159
- He didn't find his
money, that's for sure.

02:45:19,200 --> 02:45:22,078
- And he didn't find his
own drop when he went back.

02:45:22,120 --> 02:45:24,039
He didn't find the
can, we picked it up.

02:45:24,080 --> 02:45:27,167
So now he's holed up in
a room at the Ramada Inn

02:45:27,208 --> 02:45:28,627
trying to figure it out.

02:45:28,668 --> 02:45:31,296
- Let's hope he thinks it's
the Russian who blew it.

02:45:31,338 --> 02:45:32,672
- [Man] I've got enough
for an arrest warrant.

02:45:32,714 --> 02:45:33,965
We got the classified documents

02:45:34,007 --> 02:45:35,300
from the Shiloh
and the drop-off.

02:45:35,342 --> 02:45:35,842
Let's pick him up.

02:45:35,842 --> 02:45:37,636
- Well you make sure
you get him alive

02:45:37,677 --> 02:45:39,304
or we got no case
against arrest.

02:45:39,346 --> 02:45:41,973
- Don't worry, I want to hear
what John Walker has to say.

02:45:42,015 --> 02:45:46,269
- Better send a coded
message to the Shiloh.

02:45:46,311 --> 02:45:48,438
Let their commander know
that he's got a problem.

02:45:48,480 --> 02:45:51,441
(cars whooshing)

02:46:01,368 --> 02:46:04,162
(gloomy music)

02:46:07,999 --> 02:46:10,752
(sinister music)

02:46:15,090 --> 02:46:17,384
(gun clicks)

02:46:36,945 --> 02:46:39,614
(phone rings)

02:46:46,621 --> 02:46:47,497
- Yeah?

02:46:47,539 --> 02:46:49,165
- [Man] Hello, Mr. Johnson.

02:46:49,207 --> 02:46:50,125
This is the front desk.

02:46:50,166 --> 02:46:52,210
I'm sorry to disturb you.

02:46:52,252 --> 02:46:54,337
Is your van the red Chevy
with Virginia plates?

02:46:54,379 --> 02:46:55,422
- Yeah, what's up?

02:46:55,463 --> 02:46:56,464
- [Man] There's
been an accident.

02:46:56,506 --> 02:46:58,008
Guy ran into you.

02:46:58,049 --> 02:46:58,717
He's at the front desk now.

02:46:58,717 --> 02:47:01,136
If you can come down with
your insurance information,

02:47:01,177 --> 02:47:04,389
we can clear the whole
thing up for you.

02:47:05,724 --> 02:47:07,308
- Okay, I'll be down.

02:47:07,350 --> 02:47:09,519
- [Man] Thank you, sir.

02:47:52,562 --> 02:47:55,356
(gloomy music)

02:48:34,813 --> 02:48:37,398
(bell dings)

02:48:38,233 --> 02:48:39,859
- Freeze, FBI!

02:48:39,901 --> 02:48:41,486
Drop the weapon!

02:48:41,528 --> 02:48:42,362
- Okay, okay.

02:48:42,403 --> 02:48:43,988
- Drop it now!
- Easy.

02:48:44,030 --> 02:48:44,781
(grunts)

02:48:44,823 --> 02:48:47,408
- [Man] Grab the gun!

02:48:47,450 --> 02:48:49,577
- You're under arrest for
violation of the espionage laws

02:48:49,619 --> 02:48:51,579
of the United States.

02:48:52,539 --> 02:48:54,415
- You think maybe you
should contact the CIA

02:48:54,457 --> 02:48:56,793
before you do
something you regret.

02:48:56,835 --> 02:49:00,463
They can use me. (chuckles)

02:49:05,343 --> 02:49:09,013
- Take him up to the
Mastered Arms Office.

02:49:11,808 --> 02:49:14,060
(yelling)

02:49:19,065 --> 02:49:21,109
(spits)

02:49:36,541 --> 02:49:37,876
- There he is, there he is!
- That's him!

02:49:37,917 --> 02:49:40,837
(yelling)

02:49:40,879 --> 02:49:41,713
- Mike!

02:49:43,298 --> 02:49:44,132
Michael!

02:49:48,428 --> 02:49:50,138
- Walker, I'm with the FBI.

02:49:50,180 --> 02:49:53,016
You're under arrest
for espionage.

02:49:57,520 --> 02:49:59,230
- [Woman] Mr. Walker!

02:50:00,565 --> 02:50:01,691
- [Man] Arrested for espionage

02:50:01,733 --> 02:50:03,651
are John A. Walker, Jr.,

02:50:03,693 --> 02:50:05,904
