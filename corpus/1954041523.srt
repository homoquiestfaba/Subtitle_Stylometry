1
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,800
<i>My name is John H. Groberg.</i>

2
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,700
<i>I was born during the Great Depression
in Idaho Falls, Idaho.</i>

3
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,200
<i>My middle name is Holbrook,
which is my mother's maiden name.</i>

4
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,600
<i>Mom and dad gave that
name to all seven boys...</i>

5
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,000
<i>...of which I am the oldest.</i>

6
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,200
<i>We were poor,
but we lived happily...</i>

7
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,000
<i>...on large doses of home made
bread and family music.</i>

8
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,000
<i>My dad was a
real estate appraiser...</i>

9
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,900
<i>...and a prominent Democrat...</i>

10
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,200
<i>...which is to say he was about
the only Democrat in Idaho Falls.</i>

11
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,100
<i>One year President Harry Truman
came to town...</i>

12
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,400
<i>...campaigning for the re-election...</i>

13
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,400
<i>...and my dad was selected
to greet him.</i>

14
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,100
<i>President Truman did very well
among the Groberg clan that year.</i>

15
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,600
<i>I went to school at a little place
called East Side Elementary.</i>

16
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,500
<i>One morning our principal,
Miss Bunker...</i>

17
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,900
<i>...gathered all us kids out front.</i>

18
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,300
<i>She told us something terrible
had just happened...</i>

19
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,900
<i>...at a place called
Hiroshima, Japan...</i>

20
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,100
<i>...and she asked us to observe
a moment of silence.</i>

21
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,000
<i>All I knew about the Japanese
was that we were at war with them.</i>

22
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,600
<i>And yet, standing there
in front of my school...</i>

23
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,200
<i>I felt something for them.</i>

24
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,600
<i>Later in my life...</i>

25
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,100
<i>I would come to feel even more
deeply about another people...</i>

26
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,600
<i>...in a land far away.</i>

27
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,900
- Hey!
- Hey!

28
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,100
- Excuse me!
- Come on, guys!

29
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,600
- What are you doing? It's me! C'mon!
- Sorry!

30
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,500
What are you doing?

31
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Come on!

32
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,100
Go, John!

33
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Come on!

34
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,900
I'll take that!

35
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,900
I can't believe you, John Groberg!

36
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,200
- What do you mean? He's my date!
- He was your date!

37
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,900
So, what? I suppose come to
the dance by myself just because...

38
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,000
...you're playing in the band? What?

39
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,400
You can come with whomever you
want. As long as you leave with me.

40
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,700
- Really?
- Really.

41
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,600
Come on, Jean!
I want to show you something.

42
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,700
Come on, follow me!

43
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,600
It's like heaven!

44
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,400
Do you like it?

45
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,300
It's all yours.

46
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,400
I had it made special.

47
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,000
The moon, too.

48
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,700
- Get in. I want to show you something.
- Alright.

49
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,300
Look in the water and
tell me what you see.

50
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,300
I see the moon.

51
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,700
Look again.

52
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I see...

53
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,200
...me in the moon.

54
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,800
Exactly.
You in the light of the moon.

55
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,600
Do you know how many miles that
light traveled to shine on you?

56
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,100
I guess I don't.

57
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,300
Ninety-two million,
three hundred thousand. Give or take.

58
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,900
- And you know what else?
- What?

59
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,100
I think you were worth the trip.

60
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,300
Do you know what I think?

61
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,500
What?

62
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,100
I think you think too much.

63
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,200
Maybe I do.

64
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:33,300
No matter where they send me,
we'll be underneath the same moon.

65
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,400
"You are hereby called
to serve as a missionary...

66
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,900
...to the people of the Kingdom of... "
- Tonga!

67
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,800
You're going to Tonga!

68
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,300
Tonga?

69
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,400
Wait a minute!

70
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,500
Where's Tonga?

71
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,300
John, over here!

72
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,700
- Speech!
- Yeah! Let's hear a speech, Delbert!

73
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,200
- Go ahead, dad.
- Well, I...

74
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,100
...hadn't really prepared for this.
Don't know how I could have.

75
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,100
All my life I've been taught that God
loved the world so much...

76
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,000
He gave the world His son.

77
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,700
I used to think I knew
what that meant...

78
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
I didn't.

79
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,400
I don't know anyone
in Tonga well enough...

80
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,000
...to love them and
send them my son.

81
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,500
But I guess God does.

82
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,400
Keep that in mind during
the hard times, son.

83
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,000
- How much God loves His children.
- Listen to you, going on...

84
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,200
...like you know something.
- All aboard!

85
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
I love you, dad.

86
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,900
I love you, too, son.

87
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,200
I love you, mom.

88
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,300
Don't come home, son.

89
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,100
Don't come home early.

90
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,200
Three cheers for John Groberg!

91
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,700
Goodbye! See you!
Goodbye, honey.

92
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,300
<i>"Dear Jean, it's okay you couldn't
make it to the big farewell.</i>

93
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,200
<i>I wouldn't have wanted you
crying and making a fuss.</i>

94
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,600
<i>And if you hadn't cried, well,
that would've been worse.</i>

95
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,300
<i>There were seven of us
missionaries on the boat.</i>

96
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,800
<i>But the others were all continuing
to Australia or New Zealand.</i>

97
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,600
<i>I was supposed to meet the president
of the Samoan mission at the dock...</i>

98
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,400
<i>...and he was going to put me
on another boat to Tonga.</i>

99
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,900
<i>I guess he didn't know I was coming
'cause he didn't show up.</i>

100
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,300
<i>After a couple weeks
I finally found him...</i>

101
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,100
<i>...he put me on a boat to Fiji...</i>

102
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,600
<i>...where he said I could
catch another boat to Tonga.</i>

103
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,000
<i>He also told me there
would be two missionaries...</i>

104
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,600
<i>...waiting for me at the dock. "</i>

105
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,600
Get off me boat, mate!
Your tickey ends here!

106
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,300
Stop right there!
You are not on our list!

107
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
Piss on your bleeding list!
The boy gets off!

108
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,900
- I will be arresting him!
- That's his problem!

109
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,000
- Crazy man!
- Step off the plank, mate...

110
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,800
...or I'll have to push you!

111
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,200
You are under arrest.

112
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,000
Elder Louie Armstrong?

113
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,000
<i>"The missionaries
in Fiji got me a job...</i>

114
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,400
<i>...on a freighter to Tonga.
I bunked with a guy named Swede...</i>

115
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,000
<i>...who promised me a girl in
every port if I left my mission...</i>

116
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,800
<i>...and stayed on the boat. I told
him one girl was enough for me.</i>

117
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,700
<i>You know, I think he lost a lot
of respect for me when I said that.</i>

118
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,500
<i>When I finally got to Tonga,
it was business as usual.</i>

119
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,800
<i>Nobody knew I was coming.</i>

120
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,000
<i>I guess word got around
that there was a kid from Idaho...</i>

121
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,400
<i>...sitting on the dock, because
suddenly, out of the clear blue... "</i>

122
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
- Groberg? Elder John Groberg?
- Yes, sir.

123
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,900
Where on earth have
you been, young man?

124
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,800
I've prayed long and hard
about your assignment.

125
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,800
I think I have just
the place for you.

126
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,300
- Niuatoputapu.
- New what?

127
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,800
It's a small island about
eight hundred miles from here.

128
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,100
There is no white people, and
no one speaks a lick of English.

129
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,400
Sounds great.

130
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,300
Well, you have two assignments:

131
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,400
Learn the language
and build a kingdom.

132
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,000
- Any questions?
- No. I mean, yes.

133
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,800
Who'll be my companion?

134
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,600
Feki!

135
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,500
Feki, I want you to meet your
new companion, elder Groberg.

136
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,400
Welcome, Kolipoki!
I have been praying for you.

137
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,900
<i>"By far the hardest
part of my trip...</i>

138
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,000
<i>...was the eight-day journey
to my assigned island.</i>

139
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,200
<i>The seas were rough
and the boat small.</i>

140
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:21,100
<i>I got seasick after the first hour and
wished I were dead the entire trip. "</i>

141
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,100
Kolipoki?

142
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:31,700
Kolipoki, the island is here!
Journey is over. Let's go!

143
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,300
Come on. Come on!

144
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,700
<i>"They call me 'Kolipoki' because...</i>

145
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,100
<i>...they can't pronounce
'Groberg' down here.</i>

146
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,800
<i>Someday I'll probably
find out it actually means...</i>

147
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,800
<i>'white guy with a weak stomach'."</i>

148
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,900
Do you think there'll be
someone there to greet us?

149
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,100
Elder John Groberg. Thank you
so much for coming to greet me.

150
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,700
What is it with them?

151
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,300
What are they saying?

152
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,800
They are saying you are white
and soft. I think they are right.

153
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,300
Come.

154
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,900
What about our greeting party?

155
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,600
The Branch President?

156
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,100
Okay, you wait here.
I'll go and find them.

157
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,900
That...

158
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,300
...is really good.

159
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,700
- My tongue! I can't feel my tongue!
- It's all right. It's okay.

160
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,200
Tonight we celebrate the arrival...

161
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,600
...of our white brother, Kolipoki...

162
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,900
...who comes as God's messenger
to our tiny island.

163
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
He wants to know if you
have any words for them.

164
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,900
I have to go to the bathroom!

165
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,500
He has to relieve his waters.

166
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,100
The palangi has to pee!

167
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,000
I guess they all have to go also.

168
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,800
I'd hate to see what happens
when I take a bath!

169
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,100
Feki?

170
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,800
Feki!

171
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,800
<i>"Dear Jean, I hope all is well with
you back in the United States.</i>

172
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,400
<i>Things are okay here in Tonga.
The island is beautiful...</i>

173
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,300
<i>...but quite small.</i>

174
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,700
<i>Everyone is related to each other,
and the few who might listen to us...</i>

175
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,600
<i>...already belong to another church.</i>

176
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,000
<i>Their minister has warned
them not to listen to me...</i>

177
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,100
<i>...which is kind of pathetic since
I can't speak their language anyway.</i>

178
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,900
<i>My mission president told
me to 'learn the language...</i>

179
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,000
<i>...and build up the church. '</i>

180
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,800
<i>So far I'm not doing
very well at either.</i>

181
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,600
<i>The mail boat comes
just once a month...</i>

182
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,600
<i>...and the only thing I'm looking
forward to more than your letters...</i>

183
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,800
<i>...is the mosquito net my mission
president promised to send.</i>

184
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,300
<i>They have a disease here the
mosquitoes spread, call elephantitis.</i>

185
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,400
<i>Would you still love
me if I came home...</i>

186
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,600
<i>...looking like an elephant?</i>

187
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,200
<i>Enough about poor old me.</i>

188
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,500
<i>Tell me about you.
What are you doing for Christmas?</i>

189
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,800
<i>How did your finals going?</i>

190
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,300
<i>Has Edward asked
you to marry him yet?</i>

191
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,200
<i>If so, please keep in mind
the Tongan missionary...</i>

192
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,000
<i>...who is trying hard to not come
home looking like an elephant.</i>

193
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,100
<i>I love you, you know.</i>

194
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,100
<i>Write to me.</i>

195
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,800
<i>John. "</i>

196
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,500
The Branch President wants you to
speak to the members this Tuesday.

197
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,100
How can I speak
if I don't know the language?

198
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:58,500
He says we will pray for you.
Very hard.

199
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,900
We will now hear...

200
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,500
...from our palangi brother, Kopoki.

201
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,000
"We will now hear from
elder Kolipoki. "

202
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,100
No matter what he says...

203
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,700
...nod your heads...

204
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,700
...and act interested.

205
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,300
"It will be a great talk. "

206
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,900
I...

207
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,200
I am very grateful...

208
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:55,400
...to stand before you today.

209
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,200
Ever since I was a little boy...

210
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,500
I have wanted to grow up and serve...

211
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,700
...as one of the Lord's...
one of the Lord's outhouses.

212
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,800
And I suppose...

213
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,100
...that's my message
to each of you today.

214
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,600
Why has the Lord chosen
to send an outhouse...

215
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,200
...all the way from America...

216
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:35,000
...when each and every one of you...

217
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,200
...is capable of being...

218
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,300
...your own outhouse?

219
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,200
What did I say?

220
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,100
Elder Outhouse!

221
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,600
Did I say that?

222
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,700
Quiet!

223
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,700
Be kind to the elder!
Be kind to the elder!

224
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,000
A boat is coming, Kolipoki.
There will be mail.

225
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,400
Kolipoki!

226
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,400
Mele, where's Kolipoki?

227
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,500
Kolipoki!

228
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,400
Kolipoki...

229
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,400
"In the beginning God created
the heaven and the earth. "

230
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,800
"And God said, 'Let there be light! '
And there was light!"

231
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,100
"And God saw the light
and it was good. "

232
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,500
"And God divided the light
from the darkness. "

233
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,900
<i>"Dear John...</i>

234
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,100
<i>...this is the fourth letter I've sent
without hearing once from you.</i>

235
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,000
<i>I hope I'll get a whole
batch someday soon.</i>

236
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:04,300
<i>I also hope and pray
all is well with you.</i>

237
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,300
<i>You remember Edward?</i>

238
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,700
<i>Well, he proposed to me last week.</i>

239
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,400
<i>I told him I'd have to think about it,
that you and I have a deal. "</i>

240
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,500
"When I consider Thy heavens,
the work of Thy fingers... "

241
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,400
<i>"Funny thing is, I don't know
what that deal is. "</i>

242
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,800
"The moon and the stars,
which Thou hast ordained... "

243
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:29,400
<i>"I went out to our swing to think
about it. The moon was shining...</i>

244
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,900
<i>...and I remembered you saying...</i>

245
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,600
<i>'no matter where we are,
it will shine down on both of us'."</i>

246
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,100
"What is man, that Thou
art mindful of him?"

247
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,300
<i>"I felt close to you
for just a moment...</i>

248
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:51,100
<i>...as if the heavens connected us.
I miss you, you know.</i>

249
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,900
<i>Across the sky, I miss you. "</i>

250
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,100
Kolipoki!

251
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,900
Kolipoki!
Wake up!

252
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,400
Hey, man!

253
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:25,000
Where have you been
the last four days?

254
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,900
Kolipoki! You scared me!

255
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:35,200
I'm hungry enough
to eat three pigs!

256
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,900
Roasted or boiled?

257
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,900
You kill it, I'll swill it.

258
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,500
Kolipoki, how well you speak!

259
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,500
Come. Let's go to work.

260
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,600
Let the good times roll!

261
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,400
<i>"Dear Jean, I've made
progress with the language...</i>

262
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,400
<i>...and the work is going much better.</i>

263
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,900
<i>We are teaching a young man
named Finau...</i>

264
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,600
<i>...who is very excited
about the Gospel.</i>

265
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,600
<i>He would already be baptized,
but his parents won't allow it.</i>

266
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,600
<i>He and several villagers
helped us build our own house.</i>

267
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,000
<i>It was a lot of work...</i>

268
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,400
<i>...but the hardest part was evicting
the previous occupants. "</i>

269
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,300
There you go! We got it!
How about that?

270
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,300
Home, sweet home.

271
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,800
It's the cry of death.

272
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,800
Someone has died. They mourn
his passing with their cries.

273
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,600
Of all God's creations,
His children are His greatest glory.

274
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,600
Fifita!
Get off!

275
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,100
Is the pudding ready?

276
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,300
- A professional mourner?
- Yes.

277
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,500
- How does she get paid?
- A place to stay. Food to eat.

278
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,300
You know, the best gift you can
bring to a Tongan funeral...

279
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,600
...is a sack of flour or a fat pig.

280
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,700
So, Feki, why are you so?

281
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,700
Why do you have such faith in me?

282
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,900
Why shouldn't I?

283
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,000
You traveled so far to teach us,
what you say must be true.

284
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:01,000
- Yeah, but what if I lied to you?
- You wouldn't lie, Kolipoki.

285
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,900
But what if I did?

286
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,900
Then you've come a long
way just to tell a lie.

287
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,700
When I was a boy,
my father was a drinking man.

288
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,900
He used to beat my mother.

289
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,200
I wasn't strong enough
to keep him off her.

290
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,800
But the missionaries, they came
and they showed him the truth.

291
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,200
Only the truth was strong enough.

292
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,200
One day I went to thank
them for their sacrifice.

293
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,800
And they just shook
their heads and told me...

294
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,700
...of other missionaries
who sacrificed much more.

295
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,900
They were sick
to death with the fever.

296
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,800
As they left their
families behind...

297
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,000
...and crossed the sea
to preach God's word.

298
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,900
They stood up in their wagons
and shouted: "Hurrah for Israel!"

299
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,700
Every time I see
my father after that...

300
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,800
...every time he wasn't drinking,
I think the same thing:

301
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,200
"Hurrah for Israel!"

302
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,600
I think the same thing every
time I hear you teaching.

303
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,600
- Hurrah?
- Hurrah!

304
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,300
- Hurrah for Israel!
- Hurrah for Israel!

305
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,400
- Hurrah!
- Hurrah!

306
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,500
Kolipoki!

307
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,600
Kolipoki!
Kolipoki!

308
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,900
He fell from a mango tree
and hit his head on the roots.

309
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,400
Take him.

310
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,600
Bless him.
Bring him back to me.

311
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,300
He's dead.

312
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,300
Whether he is dead
or not, I do not know.

313
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,700
What I know is
I want him well again.

314
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,300
And you have the power to do it.

315
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,300
Out goes the bad air,
in comes the good.

316
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,200
Out goes the bad air,
in comes the good.

317
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,500
Out goes the bad air,
in comes the good!

318
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,200
Out goes the bad air,
in comes the good.

319
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,300
Out goes the bad air,
in comes the good.

320
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,200
Out goes the bad air,
in comes the good.

321
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,700
Out goes the bad air,
in comes the good.

322
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,700
Out with the bad air,
in with the good.

323
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:36,100
Out with the bad air,
in with the good.

324
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:42,800
<i>The day is past and gone...</i>

325
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,000
<i>The shadows...</i>

326
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,400
<i>Of the evening fall...</i>

327
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:56,900
<i>The night is coming on...</i>

328
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:03,900
<i>Within my heart a welcome guest...</i>

329
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,500
<i>Within my home abide.</i>

330
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:17,400
<i>Savior, stay this night with me...</i>

331
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:23,100
<i>Behold, 'tis eventide...</i>

332
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,600
<i>Savior...</i>

333
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,100
<i>Stay this night with me...</i>

334
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:36,900
<i>Behold, 'tis eventide...</i>

335
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,300
Where am I?

336
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,200
Here is your son.
He is alright.

337
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,400
Thank you, Kolipoki!

338
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,300
- I knew you'd do it!
- I didn't do it.

339
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,500
Papa!

340
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,700
My son!

341
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,100
<i>"Dear Jean...</i>

342
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,800
<i>...much has happened
on our little island.</i>

343
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,100
<i>Feki and I helped
God heal a little boy...</i>

344
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,300
<i>...and the whole island
seems to be aware of it.</i>

345
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,800
<i>I have a feeling we are going
to be more accepted now.</i>

346
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,200
<i>We are teaching
a beautiful new family...</i>

347
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,100
<i>...and are still working with Finau.</i>

348
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,800
<i>Our last lesson was
on the meaning of faith. "</i>

349
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,600
Like the oyster. Things which
are not seen, but which are truth.

350
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,600
<i>"I give him a pearl
as part of the lesson. "</i>

351
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,100
I understand.

352
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,100
<i>"Besides the language,
you will be happy to know...</i>

353
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,600
<i>I am working very hard
on my burping.</i>

354
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,600
<i>It's good manners here to belch
after someone feeds you a meal.</i>

355
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,400
<i>To think that all those years
I thought I was being rude.</i>

356
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,900
<i>So, Edward proposed to you.
Surprise, surprise!</i>

357
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,200
<i>Thanks for telling him
we have a deal.</i>

358
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,300
<i>As far as I am concerned, that deal is
you will be madly in love with me...</i>

359
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,300
<i>...two and a half years from now
when I return from my mission...</i>

360
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,400
<i>...we will be married and
live happily ever after.</i>

361
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,800
<i>Seriously, Jean...</i>

362
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,300
<i>I think this island is the most
beautiful place on earth.</i>

363
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:00,500
<i>And the only thing that could make it
lovelier would be your presence here.</i>

364
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,600
<i>Someday I hope we can
walk these sands together.</i>

365
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,700
<i>Until then, I love you.
John. "</i>

366
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,200
- What is it?
- My feet.

367
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,200
Did you sleep
with your feet uncovered?

368
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,900
I don't remember. It was hot!

369
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,400
I told you never to sleep
with your feet uncovered!

370
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,500
The rats, they come and eat
the soles off your feet!

371
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,000
- What?
- Sit down.

372
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,300
Wait here!

373
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,600
Sure! I'll just wait right
here and bleed to death?

374
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,700
What?

375
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,400
Your feet will have to be seared.

376
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,800
We can use a
hot knife, or the sun.

377
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,900
Over here,
where the sun is strongest.

378
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:32,300
<i>"Dear John, I am glad
to hear all is well with you.</i>

379
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,900
<i>Thank you for sharing your
version of our deal with me.</i>

380
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,100
<i>As for my version of our deal...</i>

381
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:47,700
<i>...well, I'm not sure I see things
as clearly as you do.</i>

382
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,900
<i>But I did tell Edward no.</i>

383
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,300
<i>He was pretty upset.</i>

384
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,200
<i>And he came back a week
later and proposed to me again.</i>

385
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,400
<i>I told him I'd have
to think about it again.</i>

386
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,000
<i>It's hard to have so much faith
in us when you're so far away.</i>

387
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,900
<i>What if I catch elephantitis
when you're gone?</i>

388
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,800
<i>Or what if I say no to every
suitor that comes my way...</i>

389
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,200
<i>...and you come home in love
with a Tongan princess?</i>

390
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,300
<i>Anyway, you shouldn't be
thinking of me right now.</i>

391
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,800
<i>You should be thinking
of the people of Tonga.</i>

392
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,500
<i>You should be serving them
with all of your heart...</i>

393
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,300
<i>...and reserving only
the tiniest corner of it for me.</i>

394
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,300
<i>I think I love you.</i>

395
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,400
<i>I think I'll tell Edward 'no'.</i>

396
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,900
<i>If not, I'll definitely
invite you to the wedding.</i>

397
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,800
<i>Love, Jean. "</i>

398
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:52,100
- Asi?
- Yes, Kolipoki?

399
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,100
Your daughter, Mele...

400
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,600
...why is she so quiet?

401
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,700
She is not my daughter.

402
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,700
Her mother was a bad woman
that ran around with my husband...

403
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,700
...before he was baptized.

404
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,300
I have taken her as my
own and tried to love her.

405
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,500
But an island is a small
place to escape one's heritage.

406
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,400
She punishes herself
for the sins of her father.

407
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,500
Kolipoki, the minister
has told his people...

408
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,100
...your feet are God's punishment...

409
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:41,500
...for preaching the false doctrine.
You must show your faith now.

410
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,400
Pray for your feet.

411
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,900
In three days time,
we will prove them wrong.

412
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,800
<i>"Dear Jean...</i>

413
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,500
<i>I think I've finally found the way to
keep Edward from being so hot to trot.</i>

414
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,200
<i>Please send him on
the next boat to Tonga.</i>

415
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,700
<i>I've got just the
treatment for him. "</i>

416
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:42,500
Today we would like to teach you
about God's plan of happiness.

417
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,500
What?
What's wrong?

418
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,600
Our minister told us
to stop taking your lessons.

419
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,900
- I see.
- But it is okay...

420
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,900
...if we keep feeding you.

421
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,400
Shouldn't we bless it first?

422
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,900
Okay if I say it?

423
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:18,700
Dear Father in Heaven, we thank Thee
this day for this wonderful family.

424
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,400
We thank Thee for all our blessings.

425
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,600
Especially for...

426
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:29,100
Thy marvelous plan of
happiness for Thy children.

427
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,400
We thank thee for Thy son,
Jesus Christ...

428
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,500
...who lived and died that someday we
might return to live with Thee again.

429
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,400
We thank Thee for
the knowledge that...

430
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,800
...through Thy plan of happiness...

431
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,200
...our families can
live together forever.

432
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:47,200
We are grateful for Thy
wonderful plan of happiness...

433
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,600
...and for this wonderful family...

434
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,200
...that has prepared us
this wonderful meal.

435
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,500
In the name of Jesus Christ,
Amen.

436
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,300
- Amen.
- Amen.

437
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:03,300
- Please pass the octopus.
- That was a lovely prayer, Kolipoki.

438
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,600
Next time, I'll say it.

439
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,700
Thank you for dinner.

440
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,700
At least I know one
of you enjoyed it.

441
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:26,700
- Very good, Kolipoki!
- Better late than never, huh?

442
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,000
Leave the mormons to me!

443
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,000
Hey, Tomasi!

444
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,900
Why did you help us?

445
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:31,400
Many years ago,
I was an orphan on the big island.

446
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:36,300
Missionaries like you
took care of me...

447
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,900
...and put me in school.
They were kind to me.

448
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,500
Then I moved here,
there were no missionaries...

449
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:49,900
...so I forgot about the Church.

450
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,200
Until tonight.

451
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,700
When the minister asked
us to rough up the Mormons...

452
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I remembered something:
I am one.

453
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:05,900
To Tomasi, the Mormon.

454
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,700
- Ready?
- Set...

455
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,200
...go!

456
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,400
Come on, slowpoke!

457
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,500
Who wants to go on a picnic?

458
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,900
To the backside!

459
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,200
Noli!

460
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,000
Help me, Elder!

461
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,500
I hurt my ankle!

462
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,300
Oh, boy.
This would never happen in Idaho!

463
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,000
- Come with me!
- Lavania!

464
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,600
Lavania, we can't do this.

465
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:52,100
- But I thought you liked me.
- No, I do like you.

466
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,500
Then how can you reject me?

467
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,900
Am I not pretty enough?

468
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,000
You're plenty pretty.

469
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,900
Then come!
Let's make love!

470
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,700
Come with me to the beach
and we can talk of love.

471
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,400
A kind that never ends.

472
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:18,100
- We will talk of love?
- Yeah! True love.

473
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
- More than this.
- Wait! Wait for me!

474
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:32,300
<i>"Dear John, I went on a picnic
yesterday with Edward.</i>

475
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,800
<i>He tried to get all mushy.</i>

476
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,700
<i>You are so lucky you don't have
to worry about stuff like that!"</i>

477
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,500
Tomasi!

478
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,700
Tomasi, we're here
to take you to church.

479
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,500
The Mormons.

480
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,900
You come to baptize me?

481
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,000
Yeah, sort of.

482
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,300
The pudding is all gone.

483
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,100
- Yes. I noticed.
- Well, then?

484
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,900
What's wrong, Noli?
What's bothering you?

485
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,900
You say you love us and
are trying to help us.

486
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,300
But you think you're too
good for my daughter.

487
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,400
Isn't she pretty enough for you?

488
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,600
Your daughter is very beautiful.

489
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,700
My husband offers you
hundreds of acres of our best land!

490
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,600
We offer you our daughter.

491
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,400
And still you turn up
your nose at us.

492
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,900
What do you want anyway?

493
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,300
- Well, I guess...
- I'll make you a better offer.

494
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:57,200
You don't even have to marry our
daughter or live on our island.

495
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,400
Just give us half-white baby
and we will not say anymore.

496
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,100
Surely you cannot be so selfish
as to not do that for us!

497
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:13,200
- Well, it's not really a matter of...
- What is it then?

498
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,000
- Our brown skin?
- I love your brown skin!

499
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,600
Are you too rich to share your
seed with poor people like us?

500
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,100
My seed?

501
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:25,500
- It's not that simple...
- It's not that complicated either!

502
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:36,800
I cannot share my seed
until I am married...

503
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,400
...and I cannot be married until
I'm no longer a missionary.

504
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,800
Take a day off then!

505
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,300
There is not a man on this island
who would not sell all he owns...

506
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:50,700
...to spend one hour with my daughter!

507
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,500
Yes. Yes!

508
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,500
And for that precise reason...

509
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:00,200
...she should save herself, that
most beautiful part of herself...

510
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,800
...for that man who
will love her forever!

511
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,800
Here.
Look at this.

512
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:09,500
This is a picture of my true love.

513
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,800
We want to be married
for eternity when I return.

514
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,900
So we promised we will save that
part of ourselves for each other.

515
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,100
- See how beautiful she is?
- She is very beautiful.

516
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,100
She is keeping
her promise to me.

517
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,100
Do you think that I should
break my promise to her?

518
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:46,600
Kolipoki, you must
keep your promise.

519
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,900
Go now.
Thank you for telling me.

520
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,900
I will not bother you anymore.

521
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,300
Fish for breakfast!
Just like I promised you.

522
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:34,100
- Finau!
- We're coming!

523
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,400
Get your hands off him!

524
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,300
Come on! Come on!

525
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,800
- A beautiful, white boat!
- From New Zealand!

526
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,400
It's a boat!

527
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,400
We only got room for three.

528
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,900
Please, these men
have nothing you need!

529
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:44,300
Vanela, come back!
No, my child! No!

530
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,800
Please, no more!

531
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,200
These men take all and
give nothing in return.

532
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,600
Oh my God!
No! Please!

533
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,800
Dear God in Heaven!

534
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:07,000
Mele? Mele! Please,
don't do this thing, Mele!

535
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,300
I've been where you're going!
It's a place of darkness!

536
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,200
- Please!
- For God's sake, old man!

537
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:15,300
Mele, please forgive me my sins
and live a life better than me!

538
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,300
Mele!

539
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,200
Mele!

540
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,200
Lavania Sofili Nihau...

541
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,500
...having been commissioned
of Jesus Christ...

542
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,900
I baptize you,
in the name of the Father...

543
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:53,700
...and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost.

544
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,600
Amen.

545
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,400
Amen.

546
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:57,100
The missionaries, my son.
They are here. It is what you wanted.

547
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:08,400
He has a lockjaw.
We can give him a blessing.

548
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:12,000
There will be none of
your blessings in this house!

549
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,800
The boy is dying!
It could only help!

550
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:26,800
I... See a light!

551
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,000
A light? You see a light?

552
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,100
Go to it, Finau!
Greet the light!

553
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:42,400
It comes to me...

554
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,100
We must go now.

555
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:27,200
- We just got here.
- The air grows heavy.

556
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,200
- It's always heavy.
- Not like this.

557
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,800
- We must find a place to hide.
- Hide?

558
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,400
We must go now!

559
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,400
Feki!

560
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,700
Come!

561
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,500
Hold on!

562
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:55,900
My girl!
I gotta find my girl!

563
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:02,800
Lita! Lita!

564
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,000
Look out!

565
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,100
Lita! Lita!

566
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,000
Where are you?

567
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:17,900
Lita!

568
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,900
Where are you?

569
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:22,600
Lita!

570
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,000
Lita!

571
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,600
Lita!

572
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,700
Lita!

573
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,000
Lita!

574
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,200
There she is!

575
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,400
Lita, let's go!

576
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,600
- Come on, Lita!
- Let's go.

577
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,000
Hurry!

578
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:53,000
- Come on, Feki!
- Let's go!

579
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,900
- Hurry!
- Let's go!

580
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:57,100
- Hurry!
- Don't stop!

581
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:04,600
Look out!

582
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,000
C'mon, get in! Get in!

583
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,800
- Lita!
- Papa!

584
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:05,700
Mele.

585
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:16,800
We have been through this before
and we can make it again.

586
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:20,000
Harvest all the fruits
from the fallen trees...

587
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,400
...and get all the fruit crops
from out of the ground.

588
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,900
- What about the telegraph?
- Broken in the storm.

589
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,400
But a boat should
be along in two weeks.

590
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:32,200
If we ration our food for four,
we will be alright.

591
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,900
Minister, could you please
lead us in prayer?

592
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,700
Certainly.

593
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:53,100
Dear Father,
our Father in Heaven.

594
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:56,200
We come before You
on our little island...

595
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,100
...and pray that You
will show us mercy.

596
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:04,000
We are small but we
are strong, and we love You.

597
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:07,300
We are thankful so many
of us have survived...

598
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,400
...this great storm.

599
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:15,500
Father, we know that the
storm rages on elsewhere...

600
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:18,700
...and we pray for those in its path.

601
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:24,600
Particularly those who might
be tossed on the waves of the sea.

602
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:31,500
Please care for them as
You have cared for us.

603
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,700
Amen.

604
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,600
A body washed up!
You must come! Quickly!

605
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,700
Mele.

606
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,900
Dear God, Mele!

607
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:17,200
...in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.
- Amen.

608
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,700
I cut, you choose.

609
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,600
Come on,
you took the smaller half!

610
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,200
I am the smaller person.

611
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,400
- You want some?
- No, thanks.

612
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:50,300
You really think the boat
will be here in two weeks?

613
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:56,300
I don't know, Kolipoki.
I don't know.

614
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,700
Still no boat in sight.
And no fish either.

615
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:09,100
The water in the lagoon
is still bad.

616
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:13,900
- Ready for lunch?
- Sure.

617
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,200
It's better to have little
than to have none.

618
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:27,500
<i>"Dear John...</i>

619
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:31,300
<i>...it's been six weeks since
your last letter and...</i>

620
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,000
<i>...as much as I hate to admit it,
you've got me worried.</i>

621
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,900
<i>After all you've told
me about Feki, though...</i>

622
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:39,100
<i>I know you are in good hands.</i>

623
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:43,400
<i>I hope he's taking
good care of you. "</i>

624
01:12:57,100 --> 01:13:02,200
<i>"Dear Jean, I don't know if I will
be alive when you receive this letter.</i>

625
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,200
<i>My strength is all but gone
and I frequently find myself...</i>

626
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,500
<i>...in a setting other than
the one in which we live.</i>

627
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,000
<i>It's beautiful there...</i>

628
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:13,600
<i>...and my visits reassure me
that, whether I live or die...</i>

629
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,400
<i>...it doesn't matter much.</i>

630
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:21,100
<i>Funny as it may sound, my only regret
is not having you here with me.</i>

631
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:25,700
<i>I would die with your hand
in mind, clasped tightly...</i>

632
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:28,700
<i>...to make it clear:
We will not be separated!</i>

633
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:33,500
<i>Assuming, of course, you haven't
married Edward already.</i>

634
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:38,700
<i>Jean, I've learned things
in the last few weeks...</i>

635
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,300
<i>...that are difficult to express.</i>

636
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:45,800
<i>There is a connection
between heaven and earth.</i>

637
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:51,100
<i>Finding that connection makes
everything meaningful...</i>

638
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:53,300
<i>...including death.</i>

639
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:57,000
<i>Missing it makes
everything meaningless...</i>

640
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:00,100
<i>...including life.</i>

641
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:09,100
<i>Please do all you can
to comfort mom and dad.</i>

642
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:13,700
<i>I am only now beginning to understand
the love of a parent for a child. "</i>

643
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:17,800
<i>"Dear John...</i>

644
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,200
<i>...it's been three months since your
parents or I have heard from you.</i>

645
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:25,000
<i>Are you alright?"</i>

646
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:31,000
- What do you see?
- I see...

647
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,900
I see a light!

648
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:36,600
Go to it, John! Greet the light!

649
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,400
It comes to me.

650
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,800
Kolipoki?

651
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,300
I want you to have this.

652
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:55,300
I am old and must soon die.

653
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:58,700
This storm has hurt me.

654
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:03,400
But you are young and
can yet do much good.

655
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:09,800
Please, eat my jam and live.

656
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:15,100
And please forgive me
my trespasses against you.

657
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:17,800
I didn't know you.

658
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:19,800
I was afraid.

659
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:24,000
Of all God's creations...

660
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:28,900
His children are
His greatest glory...

661
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:32,900
...and you serve God's children...

662
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:36,800
...with all your heart.

663
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:08,300
Kolipoki, Kolipoki.

664
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:15,700
There is a boat. We are saved.
Let's go.

665
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:19,800
You go ahead.
I'll stay here.

666
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,200
I will go and bring you back food!

667
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:56,600
We have a new mission president!

668
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,100
- Yes?
- Yeah. He...

669
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:03,600
...wants me to be district president.

670
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:07,800
He wants to start a school and to
start preaching in the outer islands.

671
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,000
He wants me to call
two counselors...

672
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,300
...and for you...

673
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:25,800
To go back to construction?

674
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:52,900
Goodbye.

675
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:09,400
It is hard to leave a brother.

676
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:13,500
Yes. Very hard.

677
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,900
I have a gift for you.

678
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:25,300
Finau's pearl.

679
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,700
You must keep it
to remember him by.

680
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:29,400
You must keep it
to remember me!

681
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,500
No, it's enough that I remember
you offered it to me.

682
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,300
I must go now, Kolipoki.

683
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:59,900
I will build all your chapels.

684
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,900
You will fill them, Kolipoki.

685
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:39,000
Hurrah for Israel!

686
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,300
Hurrah for Israel!

687
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,200
For Israel!

688
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,200
Hurrah!

689
01:21:55,800 --> 01:22:00,200
So, why do I keep hearing
about stolen coconuts?

690
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:03,600
Girls? Immorality?

691
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:08,800
You are my counselors.
Counsel with me.

692
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,800
They are the privileges
of the upper class.

693
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,100
Privileges?
What privileges?

694
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:17,700
Your neighbor's coconuts...

695
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:21,200
- Neighbor's wife.
- Not within the Church!

696
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:24,600
It is the way things
are done here.

697
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,800
I am a copra farmer.

698
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,600
In order to feed my family,
I need my copra...

699
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:33,700
...to be given the highest prices.
To be sure this is so...

700
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:37,500
I take my daughter to visit
the governor once a week.

701
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,600
That is, before I met you
and repented.

702
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,700
Now he gives him
a bottle of fine liquor.

703
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:46,400
- You give him liquor?
- Every Friday. For the weekend.

704
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:49,100
Tomasi, you know
that is against our religion.

705
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:52,700
Drinking liquor
is against our religion.

706
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:56,600
Giving it... is an act of charity.

707
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,700
Yeah? Well, I forbid you
from doing it again.

708
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,600
- You what?
- I said...

709
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,900
I forbid you from giving alcohol again.

710
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:08,300
You are my counselor!
I need you to set a better example.

711
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:15,000
Tomasi, where are you going?
We have a trip tomorrow!

712
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:20,300
You just don't understand, Kolipoki.

713
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:49,500
I must set a better example.

714
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:56,100
Go! That's it!

715
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:52,900
I have been thinking...

716
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:56,600
...you prayed for a tailwind.

717
01:24:56,900 --> 01:25:01,900
Perhaps there are others at sea
praying for a headwind.

718
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,800
We should make it possible
for God to bless both...

719
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,900
...by praying only for a good wind.

720
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,700
We'll each say our own.

721
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,200
Get in.

722
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:56,400
To make it by sundown,
we must go now.

723
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,800
Make it where?

724
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:03,400
There is a family that
wants to hear the Gospel.

725
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:06,300
We have an errand from the Lord.
Get in.

726
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:19,500
Stay the night there.
We will have wind by the morning.

727
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:23,500
Take this with you.

728
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,500
Why are you doing this?

729
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:56,400
I didn't decide to serve the
Lord until I was old and tired.

730
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,500
Tired from all the sin.

731
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:06,300
You, you are young and
already gave your life to Him.

732
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:09,400
I cannot be young again...

733
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:14,800
...but today,
I can be the Lord's wind.

734
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:39,600
Mama! Mama!
They're here!

735
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:42,300
- They came!
- I saw them coming!

736
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:52,700
<i>"Dear John...</i>

737
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:55,700
<i>...the islands, the people
there sound wondrous.</i>

738
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:57,500
<i>You sound wondrous, too.</i>

739
01:27:57,700 --> 01:28:00,400
<i>I can almost feel you stretching.</i>

740
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,800
<i>It is hard to imagine
how I could possibly keep up. "</i>

741
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,600
<i>"You don't need to keep up.
You just need to be you. "</i>

742
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:15,200
<i>"I'm getting ready to graduate.</i>

743
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:17,500
<i>I'll probably end up
teaching school somewhere. "</i>

744
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:20,400
<i>"I wish you could
teach school here.</i>

745
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:25,200
<i>Can you hear them, Jean...</i>

746
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:28,100
<i>...can you hear the
children singing?"</i>

747
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:39,300
<i>"All my love to you. "</i>

748
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:49,700
Kolipoki! Elder!
Your president is here!

749
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:54,700
Hello!

750
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:57,400
You must be the new president.

751
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,700
- I didn't expect you.
- I'm on my way to Vava'u.

752
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:03,900
Our boat stops here for the night.

753
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:07,600
So, pleased to meet you.

754
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,900
- Will you be staying here?
- No, I have a room down in the village.

755
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:15,300
I haven't heard much from you.

756
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:19,000
I was hoping you could give me
a report on your activities.

757
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,800
Certainly, certainly...

758
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,400
Well, I believe we're doing
what you asked.

759
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:25,800
The school is growing...

760
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,900
...we're traveling to the outer islands,
preaching and baptizing.

761
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:30,900
Who have you baptized?

762
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:39,500
- Well, we baptized Vika, Hale, Pita...
- I have no records of them, nor do I...

763
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:42,100
...have any reports of your work here.
- There's been lots of work.

764
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:44,000
- I didn't know...
- When you baptize someone...

765
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:47,000
...you are supposed to fill out
a baptismal record.

766
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:50,800
You are also supposed to send weekly
reports telling me what you've done.

767
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:55,700
For all I know, you could have been
vacationing here for the last two years!

768
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:58,400
Well, no one ever asked
me about any reports...

769
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,000
...except the branch
president in Felemea...

770
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:01,900
We don't have a branch in Felemea!

771
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:05,200
Yes, we have a good, strong
branch of thirty-two members.

772
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,900
And a nice chapel, too.

773
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:10,600
Who authorized you to organize
a branch in Felemea?

774
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:13,700
Who authorized you
to build a chapel?

775
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:16,000
Well, it's just that we've been
baptizing so many people...

776
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:19,600
Where did you get the money?
Whose land is it built on?

777
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:24,800
I don't know whose property it's built
on, but everyone in Felemea knows...

778
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,200
Everyone in Felemea,
but no one in my office!

779
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:38,300
Elder Groberg, the house of
the Lord is a house of order.

780
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:42,900
- There are forms for these things.
- Forms?

781
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,000
Which one?

782
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:04,100
President!

783
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:07,200
President Stone!

784
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:12,200
These are the baptisms,
the priesthood ordinations...

785
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:17,100
...the branches we've organized
and the chapels we've built.

786
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:21,600
I'm really sorry that
I didn't know about the forms.

787
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,000
Elder Groberg...

788
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:26,700
I've been up all night worrying
about what I said...

789
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:30,900
...yesterday.
Looks like you have been, too.

790
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:37,100
I've never seen a happier bunch
of Saints anywhere on earth.

791
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:40,700
You just keep doing
what you're doing.

792
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:45,800
Another thing. I would like
to extend your mission six months.

793
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,100
Sounds great!

794
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:50,400
I'll be putting two new chapels
into your district.

795
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:53,300
Seeing as they're going
to be made of concrete...

796
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:55,600
...you probably should
purchase the land.

797
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:59,300
Okay!

798
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,400
Kuli, we have a visitor!

799
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:27,100
- It is wrong to stow away!
- Yes!

800
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,200
Now, swim home
and hurry up about it!

801
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:36,100
Okay.

802
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:45,400
You know, my parents left me
once at a gas station.

803
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:49,300
We're just driving
around the block, right?

804
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:51,400
How will he learn if I give in?

805
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:54,700
Kuli, what about sharks?
Leg cramps?

806
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:58,400
He is my son.
He will be alright.

807
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,500
Get the sail!
Get the sail now!

808
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:17,500
I got it!

809
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:20,700
Help me pull!
Help me pull it!

810
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:23,200
Stay there, Kolipoki!

811
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:32,400
- Kuli!
- Get the sail, Tomasi!

812
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:41,600
Kuli!

813
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:04,900
- Kolipoki!
- Hold on, Kolipoki!

814
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,400
Kuli!

815
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:32,800
Tomasi!

816
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:03,800
<i>"Dear John, I am thrilled to hear
about your new assignment...</i>

817
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,600
<i>...although I'm sure it is
sometimes overwhelming.</i>

818
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,200
<i>I felt that way
when I finished school...</i>

819
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,300
<i>...and took my first job
down here in Anaheim.</i>

820
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:15,500
<i>My friends are all back in Utah,
my family in North Hollywood.</i>

821
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:20,700
<i>Here I have only my students
and lots of time to think of you.</i>

822
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:26,500
<i>Are you well, John?
Are you safe?</i>

823
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:28,400
<i>Do you have time
to think of me...</i>

824
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:32,100
<i>...or are you completely
lost in the Lord's work?</i>

825
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:36,600
<i>The Scriptures say you find
your life by losing it...</i>

826
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:39,800
<i>...and as much as I miss you...</i>

827
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,700
<i>I encourage you on in that quest.</i>

828
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:48,300
<i>Lose yourself, John,
every last bit of yourself.</i>

829
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:50,800
<i>Then, when you come home...</i>

830
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:54,600
<i>I'll know I'm in love with the
version of you God intended. "</i>

831
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:04,300
He's over there!

832
01:36:04,700 --> 01:36:05,900
Hey, Kuli!

833
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:10,100
- Kolipoki, over here!
- Over here!

834
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:13,700
Swim, Kolipoki!

835
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:15,100
Kolipoki!

836
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:16,300
Kolipoki!

837
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:24,500
This is no place for resting.

838
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:37,600
Sometimes God calms the storm.
Sometimes He calms the sailor.

839
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:42,400
Sometimes, He just lets us swim.

840
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:28,800
I am so sorry, Kolipoki!

841
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:44,400
Something for me?

842
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:56,400
- You want to tell me what it says?
- I don't know.

843
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:59,500
It's confidential.

844
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:08,200
<i>"Dear Elder Groberg. Stop.</i>

845
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:12,400
<i>Request for extension
denied by Salt Lake. Stop.</i>

846
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:15,000
<i>Boat to New Zealand...</i>

847
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:20,100
<i>...airplane to Los Angeles,
next week. Stop.</i>

848
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:27,500
<i>Leave island as soon
as possible. Stop. "</i>

849
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:49,600
- Thank you for the school, Kolipoki.
- You're welcome.

850
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:52,700
- Thank you for behaving.
- Yes.

851
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:57,600
We have you a gift
for you, Kolipoki.

852
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:07,200
- Burial clothes?
- From Salt Lake.

853
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:11,200
They asked us to keep them with
you at all times but not tell you.

854
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:13,800
We are happy we did
not need to use them.

855
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,600
Thank you.
So am I.

856
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:23,800
We have another surprise
for you, Kolipoki.

857
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:16,200
<i>A firey horse with the speed of light.
A cloud of dust and a hearty.</i>

858
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:19,900
<i>Hi-o Silver!
The Lone Ranger!</i>

859
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:26,100
<i>Return to those thrilling days of
yesteryear. From out of the past...</i>

860
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:29,800
<i>"Dear John...</i>

861
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:36,700
<i>...I wish... "
- "... You could see what... "</i>

862
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:38,200
"... I see. "

863
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
- Tomasi.
- You took care of me.

864
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:06,400
<i>God be with you
till we meet again...</i>

865
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:13,600
<i>By His counsels guide
uphold you...</i>

866
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:15,600
<i>With His sheep...</i>

867
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:20,600
<i>Securely fold you...</i>

868
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:23,600
<i>- God be with you till we meet again
- Your body may leave us...</i>

869
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:26,900
...but your spirit will always
remain on our island.

870
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:39,800
Thanks.

871
01:42:56,900 --> 01:42:57,900
Aloha.

872
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:05,800
Goodbye, Kolipoki.

873
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:20,600
How beautiful upon the mountains
are the feet...

874
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:42,300
Remember: True love.

875
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:49,400
- Eternal love.
- That's right.

876
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:05,400
<i>God be with you till we meet again...</i>

877
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:12,600
<i>Keep love's banner
floating o'er you...</i>

878
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:19,700
<i>Smite death's threatening
wave before you...</i>

879
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:25,900
<i>God be with you
till we meet again...</i>

880
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:29,500
<i>Till we meet...</i>

881
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:33,300
<i>Till we meet...</i>

882
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:40,000
<i>Till we meet at Jesus' feet...</i>

883
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:44,400
<i>Till we meet...</i>

884
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:50,500
<i>Till we meet...</i>

885
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:57,600
<i>God be with you till we meet again...</i>

886
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:11,600
<i>"Dear Jean...</i>

887
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:15,000
<i>...it finally happened.
I am coming home. "</i>

888
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:17,300
- President Stone!
- Elder Groberg!

889
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:24,100
<i>"Funny, though...</i>

890
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:27,200
<i>It feels more like
I'm leaving home.</i>

891
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:40,200
<i>For the past three years
I've lived among...</i>

892
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:42,700
<i>...people who possess nothing...</i>

893
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:44,700
<i>...yet possess everything. "</i>

894
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,700
John!

895
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:55,400
<i>"In this life they sail the oceans.
In the next they will sail the skies.</i>

896
01:45:56,400 --> 01:46:01,000
<i>I wish to be more like them:
A boatman among the stars.</i>

897
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:06,700
<i>And I wish to have you with me,
your softness at my side.</i>

898
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:11,600
<i>Jean... Jean, Jean...</i>

899
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:15,700
<i>Will you love me across the sky?"</i>

900
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:24,800
Get back here!

901
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,500
I'm gonna catch you!

902
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:32,400
You gotta be faster than that!
