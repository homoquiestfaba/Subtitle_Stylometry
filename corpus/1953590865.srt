Measurements skill of 1 to 10, total
value to the board this rocket is 37!

4
00:01:23,523 --> 00:01:25,567
This is Terra Dino Park!

5
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,652
A comfortable place to stay.

6
00:01:27,736 --> 00:01:30,864
Especially for fans
dinosaurs, like me.

7
00:01:31,865 --> 00:01:37,120
You know, dinosaur fossils were found in the
us more than any other place on earth?

8
00:01:39,164 --> 00:01:43,293
If you visit, I will
be your tour guides were great.

9
00:01:51,718 --> 00:01:53,762
Sorry Mr. Hodges!

10
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:55,889
Ernie Fitzpatrick!

11
00:01:57,933 --> 00:01:58,975
How dare you!

12
00:02:00,903 --> 00:02:03,989
Hello, sister?
How to practice soccer balls?

13
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:07,075
Mother would be very upset with you!
Again!

14
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,786
You know, you're supposed to keep the store?

15
00:02:10,028 --> 00:02:12,823
This is for you, 25 cents. Contact
someone you loved.

16
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,617
If you can find a pay phone.

17
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:21,456
He will soon tell my mom.

18
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:24,042
His head will explode when he saw me!

19
00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:26,086
But I'm not Julia.

20
00:02:26,128 --> 00:02:30,298
Mom was busy to attend
awards show exemplary parents.

21
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:35,429
Important part of a person
parents are making the rules.

22
00:02:35,512 --> 00:02:37,514
Thank you for this award.

23
00:02:42,853 --> 00:02:44,818
Ernie, do you
on the way?

24
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:48,024
Yeah, I had to stop because
Julia wants to borrow my money.

25
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:53,155
Well, mom to go now. Maternal leave
sign waiting for 15 minutes in front of the door.

26
00:02:53,238 --> 00:02:56,283
-- You know what you must do, Ernie?
-- Leave a message.

27
00:02:56,366 --> 00:03:01,496
15 minutes means you will
arrived at exactly 2:53, okay?

28
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,581
Yes, I understand.

29
00:03:07,836 --> 00:03:10,922
I'm very familiar with my mother,
he's always watching me.

30
00:03:11,006 --> 00:03:14,050
I have never tasted freedom.

31,
00:03:16,178 --> 00:03:17,179
Hello?

32
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,348
-- Ernie if you have to store?
-- Soon to enter.

33
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:24,436
-- Okay, do the best you can do.
-- Back in 15 minutes.

34
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:26,521
Both Mom.
"Back in 150 minutes."

35
00:03:26,563 --> 00:03:29,733
You heard him, he said
as fast as I could.

36
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:38,049
Ah ...

37
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:41,161
National Museum of Terra Dino.

38
00:03:41,203 --> 00:03:44,289
The only places in the world.

39
00:03:45,415 --> 00:03:48,460
And that this is the Mystery Stone.

40
00:03:49,544 --> 00:03:54,716
You see the carvings?
've Been there since the time of the Cretaceous.

41
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:58,845
Very strange, because who
who will carve it?

42
00:03:58,887 --> 00:04:03,016
No man alive
at 145 million years ago!

43
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,143
Only dinosaurs.

44
00:04:05,227 --> 00:04:10,357
Is not it mysterious?
Well, that's what we know in there.

45
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,400
Restore.

46
00:04:12,442 --> 00:04:14,486
It is my best friend Max.

47
00:04:14,528 --> 00:04:16,613
He always had a way of
make something cool.

48
00:04:16,655 --> 00:04:18,698
Which makes it look cool ...

49
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:21,827
... But sometimes, other children
did not see it that way.

50
00:04:22,869 --> 00:04:24,996
Do you think Leonardo da Vinci
never painted his own son?

51
00:04:25,997 --> 00:04:26,998
What? Pal?

52
00:04:29,126 --> 00:04:30,168
See, there are gorgeous.

53
00:04:30,252 --> 00:04:32,295
What? Where?

54
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,820
Basic Suck!

55
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:37,045
Hahaha ...

56
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:42,139
-- Ernie, how to board the rocket?
assessment 1 to 10 ... -- 37, a friend.

57
00:04:42,722 --> 00:04:43,723
Buuyaa!!

58
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:47,894
You and your dad really
make this amazing thing.

59
00:04:47,936 --> 00:04:49,938
Hey, talk about my father ...

60
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,607
According to him, there are examples of new fossil
which has been excavated in 2329.

61
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:55,193
You'd better come on
opening ceremony tomorrow.

62
00:04:55,235 --> 00:04:59,406
Fabulous! I've recorded it?
I can not wait anymore.

63
00:05:00,407 --> 00:05:04,536
Wait ...
But the show has not been opened.

64
00:05:04,578 --> 00:05:06,706
Are not you supposed to keep the store your mother?

65
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:07,847
Friends ...

66
00:05:07,848 --> 00:05:11,435
You're like my mother who always
tell me what to do this and that!

67
00:05:11,618 --> 00:05:15,747
Do you know, breaking the rules is wrong
the best part of us as children.

68
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:21,219
The most important thing to be
parents are making the rules.

69
00:05:21,303 --> 00:05:23,346
Once the rules have been made ...

70
00:05:23,388 --> 00:05:28,560
... The key is to make them obedient.
Exactly as you wish.

71
00:05:30,645 --> 00:05:34,858
Doing all things as he wishes,
and not what I want to do.

72
00:05:35,859 --> 00:05:36,943
It is a compromise.

73
00:05:36,985 --> 00:05:38,945
There is no compromise!

74
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:44,242
This goal will be achieved if both
all family members to participate.

75
00:05:44,284 --> 00:05:48,371
Of course, that does not mean we
become abusive parents.

76
00:05:48,413 --> 00:05:52,501
Ready to begin. Mission
Arrest Large--Magnitude!

77
00:05:56,797 --> 00:05:59,800
The beauty of this is when the ancient objects ...

78
00:06:00,884 --> 00:06:05,013
It is Gallimimus. He could
run as far as 20 miles per hour.

79
00:06:05,097 --> 00:06:09,226
25 miles per hour. You have to
read more.!

80
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:15,524
And it is the super--duper--saurus opinion.

81
00:06:15,565 --> 00:06:17,609
Well, we continue
to another place.

82
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:24,908
Sometimes kids think they
knows better than in adults.

83
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:29,079
-- They do not know more than adults
"Just For The Stakeholder"

84
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,377
-- We should not.
-- But we have to.

85
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:37,337
Stay alert!

86
00:06:47,806 --> 00:06:48,849
It seems fairly complicated.

87
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:53,019
With the right algorithms and variable
possible key combination can be found.

88
00:06:53,103 --> 00:06:57,190
What about the possibility of
the door is not locked? Buuyaa!!

89
00:06:59,515 --> 00:07:01,115
Buuyaa ..

90
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:06,033
What if they follow us?

91
00:07:09,786 --> 00:07:14,916
Tyrannosaurus!
The most deadly predators.

92
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,001
Attacked without mercy

93
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:19,129
It's just a T--Rex statue, Max.
Let's go.

94
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,174
Always keep an eye on.

95
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,342
That's our baby.

96
00:07:25,343 --> 00:07:28,430
If we get complacent a little while!

97
00:07:28,513 --> 00:07:31,558
Who knows chaos
what will be done.

98
00:07:44,112 --> 00:07:47,240
<i> Hey, Max look.
He's definitely in there. </ I>

99
00:07:48,283 --> 00:07:50,327
<i> Yeah, but this thing covered. </ i>

100
00:07:50,452 --> 00:07:52,454
<i> pity.
Let's get out of here. </ I>

101
00:07:52,537 --> 00:07:55,582
I'm not here just to infiltrate
to see the giant cover!

102
00:07:55,665 --> 00:07:57,667
Let us remove the lid.

103
00:07:58,752 --> 00:08:01,880
-- I do not know Ernie ...
-- I pull this section, you pull in there.

104
00:08:03,965 --> 00:08:04,925
Be careful!

105
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:13,308
-- Hey, what are you doing?
-- Infrared motion detectors.

106
00:08:14,392 --> 00:08:15,393
Wait!

107
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:22,734
Watch this!

108
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:28,949
Can I get into?

109
00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:38,291
Ernie, I'd love to be
like before I was an adult!

110
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:41,420
Cool!

111
00:08:45,674 --> 00:08:49,845
Now it's time.
One, two, three!

112
00:09:02,315 --> 00:09:06,445
-- Very scary.
-- 900. No offense to board a rocket!

113
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:07,529
Not a problem.

114
00:09:09,614 --> 00:09:11,700
Sarcosuchus.

115
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:14,828
I'm sure you do not want
met him in the darkness.

116
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:18,957
With teeth like that? I
do not want to meet at any time.

117
00:09:19,082 --> 00:09:23,128
You can not lie
again to me, Ernie.

118
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:25,213
It's your 25 cents.

119
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:28,341
You'd better call a lawyer!

120
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:39,895
Secure location.

121
00:09:46,952 --> 00:09:47,995
Shut up the kids.

122
00:09:56,578 --> 00:09:59,623
I smell a spy
in the museum.

123
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:13,261
Let's go!

124
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:19,877
Goodbye forever!

125
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,061
Alright.

126
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,205
Ratings of 1 to 10?

127
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:28,460
Minus 50! You drive it without notice
and do not know where to go.

128
00:10:28,902 --> 00:10:32,030
Calm Max.
I've been very familiar with this place.

129
00:10:35,117 --> 00:10:36,159
I get it,
I get it.

130
00:10:45,627 --> 00:10:46,628
You think you can?

131
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:50,715
Do not believe you underestimate me, Max.
I'm a little hurt!

132
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,884
Exit on the left.

133
00:10:56,012 --> 00:10:57,055
I guess not.

134
00:11:12,354 --> 00:11:13,439
Thank you for this award.

135
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:15,624
You back ...

136
00:11:21,922 --> 00:11:28,095
Now I introduce the ...
"Boy--saurus is the problem."

137
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,309
Well ...

138
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:38,480
Could explain, technically
I did not violate orders.

139
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:39,565
Ernie ...

140
00:11:39,606 --> 00:11:42,693
You asked me to go to the store after school.
And I've been there.

141
00:11:42,776 --> 00:11:45,821
There is proof. I
leave a note.

142
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:47,906
"Back in 150 minutes."

143
00:11:47,948 --> 00:11:53,161
You see, I'm not breaking orders.
I just went to study at the museum.

144
00:11:53,203 --> 00:11:55,789
You know you've been violated.

145
00:11:55,831 --> 00:11:58,375
Plus, the damage at the museum. They
announcement of their new pair robbed.

146
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,504
I know Mom, I'm sorry.

147
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:06,758
Deeds cause harm to
others, you must learn to fix it.

148
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,929
I should have been able to count on,
another party and one day will be.

149
00:12:10,971 --> 00:12:14,016
I just wanted to see the skeleton.

150
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:19,271
They are just fossils millions of years,
they are not going to go anywhere.

151
00:12:19,313 --> 00:12:22,900
Okay, now I
punish three weeks.

152
00:12:22,941 --> 00:12:26,445
This peraturanku Ernie,
and there is no compromise!

153
00:12:26,486 --> 00:12:29,573
Go into your room, close the door
until I call you for dinner.

154
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:35,913
Hemh, Mother of the Year, Haa ..

155
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:38,957
No one
requesting choice.

156
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:46,340
Can not you make your life
interesting than just bugging me alone.

157
00:12:46,381 --> 00:12:49,468
Three weeks? It was a penalty
toughest you've ever received.

158
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,554
I would not be caught
if the alarm is not turned on.

159
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,640
And I know Max very thorough ...

160
00:12:54,665 --> 00:12:56,665
Tarraaa ...

161
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,896
-- You!
-- I'm what?

162
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,024
You will receive a reply.

163
00:13:07,194 --> 00:13:09,279
Enjoy your week sentenced to three.

164
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:16,578
This is not fair.

165
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:21,750
It never ends.

166
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:23,794
Ernie's time to go to the store.

167
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:25,879
Ernie's time to practice violin.

168
00:13:25,963 --> 00:13:27,965
Time to clean up your room, Ernie.

169
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:33,220
What about the time Ernie?
When can I have my own rules.

170
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:39,434
There is an open window beside me.

171
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,563
At other times I would think twice.

172
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:46,733
I can not.

173
00:13:48,902 --> 00:13:49,862
I do not want to.

174
00:13:50,988 --> 00:13:52,990
But I have to!

175
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:00,372
Ernie, can not be trusted!

176
00:14:17,014 --> 00:14:19,099
Max, open the door.

177
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:20,100
I came.

178
00:14:25,355 --> 00:14:28,483
There are still weaknesses in the
door opener equipment my father.

179
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:29,526
Think.

180
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:33,697
Not your mother ...

181
00:14:36,867 --> 00:14:38,869
Your mother does not punish you?

182
00:14:40,996 --> 00:14:42,039
Stop it, stop it!

183
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:47,294
Yeah, he's punishing me for three weeks.

184
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:50,339
But you're here.

185
00:14:51,465 --> 00:14:56,595
-- What about your father?
-- I had to help him after school a few months.

186
00:14:56,678 --> 00:14:57,721
Open up your mind.

187
00:14:58,722 --> 00:15:00,006
Friends, who else can.

188
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,978
No, not Mrs. Ernie
allow it to drink soda.

189
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,022
Ernie Her mother is not here.

190
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,500
Hehe ...

191
00:15:18,575 --> 00:15:21,620
Is getting bigger garage?

192
00:15:21,662 --> 00:15:24,748
True. We sell cars and
made a study room.

193
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:27,918
Father, Ernie is here.

194
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,919
Here!

195
00:15:34,174 --> 00:15:37,344
Hey Dr. Santiago, how
development of its Time Machine?

196
00:15:38,345 --> 00:15:40,430
Four years and still does not work.

197
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,643
So long, I think its key
not connected properly.

198
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:48,772
Now I think the problem
in the control panel.

199
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,900
Look.
Function relaynya functioning normally.

200
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:55,028
Transfer mode location, function.

201
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:57,072
I do not know.

202
00:15:58,156 --> 00:15:59,199
You must be the father.

203
00:16:00,242 --> 00:16:01,285
We certainly can.

204
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,454
You know the robot vacuum?

205
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:09,626
I'm sure, could probably use
as a time machine so that power can be.

206
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:14,840
Time in which I could
make my own rules?

207
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:17,926
Ratings of 1 to 10 ...

208
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,053
-- You can not do it.
-- No doubt.

209
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:26,310
Sneaking out and drinking soda.
Double trouble!

210
00:16:26,351 --> 00:16:27,352
Basic handyman stalker!

211
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:32,566
Three weeks is not much. I will promise
make in the law for three years.

212
00:16:32,608 --> 00:16:33,650
You guys be careful!

213
00:16:34,651 --> 00:16:37,779
These items belonged to my father,
stop fighting.

214
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:38,780
Give the phone.

215
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,506
I do not do it!

216
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,316
Sneaking out, drinking soda ...

217
00:17:15,317 --> 00:17:16,360
And damage the engine ... Dr. Santiago.

218
00:17:16,443 --> 00:17:19,446
Ernie, you got three problems!

219
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,616
So this is my fault? I think not!

220
00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:24,701
You came and suddenly the fun ...

221
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:26,828
... Stop.

222
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,213
Maybe there is construction work on the road.

223
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,299
What is it?

224
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:44,471
Max, do you have a dog that
you never tell me?

225
00:17:45,639 --> 00:17:47,641
This is so weird.

226
00:17:47,724 --> 00:17:51,770
Well, do not have the touch
I think the control panel is problematic.

227
00:18:31,435 --> 00:18:32,977
Julia, are you okay?

228
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,206
-- Is he still there?
-- Yes, but ...

229
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,733
Look ... he's not going to hurt us.

230
00:18:38,775 --> 00:18:42,863
She looks like ...
He smiles?

231
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:47,117
Good, now may we go home?

232
00:18:48,118 --> 00:18:52,247
It was a real T--Rex.
Cool!!

233
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,631
Ernie!

234
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:01,673
Look out!

235
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:04,801
Calm down, he did not look
being caught.

236
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:08,931
Possible. But you can not
make our heads ... ducking.

237
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:16,230
Just relax. Do not you
look how cool this.

238
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:19,399
Ernie, he can bite and we
could not get out of this place.

239
00:19:19,483 --> 00:19:20,484
I think ...

240
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:26,698
Museum has been doing the job ...
great to make this sculpture.

241
00:19:27,783 --> 00:19:29,785
Feels very alive.

242
00:19:35,082 --> 00:19:39,253
It's real ..
It's so real?

243
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:42,339
He licked it, like a newborn.

244
00:19:56,937 --> 00:19:57,980
It makes sense.

245
00:19:58,021 --> 00:20:02,150
This form of time machine
like a dinosaur egg.

246
00:20:02,192 --> 00:20:03,151
It makes sense.

247
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,320
Hello ... Are we like a baby dinosaur?

248
00:20:10,534 --> 00:20:13,579
He did not call all of them
for dinner, right?

249
00:20:15,306 --> 00:20:19,518
No, he called all of them to
look at that cute baby.

250
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,389
And it looks like they're talking.

251
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:37,060
We are happy you joined Tyra.

252
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:40,689
Yeah, it looks like your eggs do not
've got a hitch.

253
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:49,031
The way you treat us like
your son is so wonderful time.

254
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,700
And you're entitled to
have your own child.

255
00:20:51,742 --> 00:20:54,286
You're still keeping us?

256
00:20:54,328 --> 00:20:58,457
I mean, maybe Sarco settles
then takes us.

257
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:03,754
Come on Neo, do not worry.
I'm not going anywhere.

258
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,797
You all are my family.

259
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:08,842
I'll take care of Sarco brothers.

260
00:21:08,926 --> 00:21:12,012
And when my babies large
he will take care of you too.

261
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:20,395
-- What do we have here?
-- There is food? I'm very hungry.

262
00:21:21,438 --> 00:21:24,483
What's the matter with you, are you nuts?

263
00:21:24,525 --> 00:21:26,652
Do you want to get caught?
He can hurt you.

264
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,867
There's something happening here.

265
00:21:38,121 --> 00:21:39,122
What do you see?

266
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:43,252
That's not me. I never
lose anything! Really!

267
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:46,380
Stand up!

268
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:50,551
Then why are here to
stinks, tell me?

269
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,678
I think his voice will not be hard.

270
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,063
Will you shut up?

271
00:22:03,146 --> 00:22:06,233
Sarco brothers want to know
all about Tyra.

272
00:22:09,444 --> 00:22:11,405
I have a plan!

273
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,575
We must immediately inform him about this.

274
00:22:15,617 --> 00:22:16,660
Yeah, right.

275
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,959
Amateur basis!

276
00:22:25,002 --> 00:22:28,130
Do not make them a voice,
they do not sound like us.

277
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:33,343
They look very strange.

278
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:39,099
They are gorgeous. And they will grow
big and strong like his mother.

279
00:22:39,141 --> 00:22:43,854
Now everything is gone,
the baby should sleep. Go.

280
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:44,855
Alright.

281
00:22:45,856 --> 00:22:46,857
This is our chance.

282
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,027
July, come on, we live a little while.

283
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:55,282
We can set the time machine to go home and
mother would never realize if we go.

284
00:22:55,324 --> 00:22:57,326
We're not going to get in trouble.

285
00:22:57,367 --> 00:23:01,496
This is not about negotiations, Ernie, this
on our return home.

286
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,752
Max, do you know how to work this thing?

287
00:23:08,795 --> 00:23:09,796
Let me see.

288
00:23:10,964 --> 00:23:15,010
Should be in the process of initialization ...

289
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:20,224
And the counting process is not working
because no power locks.

290
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:26,521
You mean we can not come home on time.
It could be any where and anytime.

291
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,650
I'll give it to them later, okay?

292
00:23:30,692 --> 00:23:34,905
I mean, the mother dinosaurs must have been very
angry when the baby suddenly gone.

293
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:40,035
Do not worry on Jul ...

294
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:45,249
I'm sure it must exist in
about where we landed.

295
00:23:45,332 --> 00:23:48,418
We'll find it.
Soon ...

296
00:23:54,675 --> 00:23:57,761
Ernie, we're stuck here.

297
00:23:57,844 --> 00:23:59,388
Everything will be fine.

298
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:00,931
Look around our July

299
00:24:01,014 --> 00:24:06,103
This is Tyra Dino in the Cretaceous period.

300
00:24:06,186 --> 00:24:07,145
And?

301
00:24:07,187 --> 00:24:09,273
And everything is really great!

302
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,359
This is the story of our history.

303
00:24:12,442 --> 00:24:15,529
Millions of years before we were born.

304
00:24:15,571 --> 00:24:17,614
See, it was Stone Mystery.

305
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:22,870
And the nest is definitely his garage
Max, and we may be very close.

306
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:23,871
Home ...

307
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:29,042
Ernie? Dinner time.

308
00:24:33,255 --> 00:24:37,384
Ernie Come on, I know you're angry,
but at least open your door.

309
00:24:46,894 --> 00:24:48,937
Julia, did you see where your brother?

310
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,110
Go to catch Ernie.

311
00:24:52,135 --> 00:24:54,635
Well, about where he was going.

312
00:24:56,236 --> 00:24:58,280
He probably went to the usual place.

313
00:25:04,578 --> 00:25:06,580
<i> moment. </ i>

314
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,792
Hello Sue ...

315
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,922
Hello Dr. Santiago ...

316
00:25:14,963 --> 00:25:17,090
<i> Please, I hope he
called Diego ... </ i>

317
00:25:18,175 --> 00:25:20,177
Can you come down?

318
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:27,434
Yeah sorry, I'm trying
improve robotku

319
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,518
Sorry.

320
00:25:28,602 --> 00:25:33,732
-- Is Ernie here?.
-- Yeah, he's in the garage Max, I think Julia was there.

321
00:25:33,774 --> 00:25:34,775
They're looking at Time Machine.

322
00:25:35,817 --> 00:25:36,860
Time Machine?

323
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:49,373
When he was busy, let's explore.

324
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:51,500
To search for power key.

325
00:25:52,543 --> 00:25:56,713
Ernie, if you were there,
I'll say to the mother.

326
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,758
It's up to you.
I'm having fun.

327
00:26:05,013 --> 00:26:07,140
Hi, Mom .. Mother ...

328
00:26:08,141 --> 00:26:09,226
Can I go out? Not!

329
00:26:13,355 --> 00:26:15,482
Right, you should not go anywhere.

330
00:26:16,525 --> 00:26:20,654
There is always a way out, we
look lived alone.

331
00:26:22,739 --> 00:26:23,740
Oh yeaah.

332
00:26:26,994 --> 00:26:27,995
What is it?

333
00:26:37,421 --> 00:26:40,424
Yuuki ... Your brother brought gifts.

334
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:43,594
-- Let me see, where is it? Where are they?
-- Orphan.

335
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,637
Good for you Mom, let me see them.

336
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:48,206
Let me see them. Where are they?
They're what?.

337
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,851
They have different colors.

338
00:27:02,446 --> 00:27:06,533
Had a brother, I finally had a brother.
I know one day it will get it.

339
00:27:06,617 --> 00:27:09,703
Who will be sleeping next to mom ...

340
00:27:09,745 --> 00:27:10,704
And of course it was me.

341
00:27:10,787 --> 00:27:13,832
She will sing songs
The most I usually prefer.

342
00:27:13,874 --> 00:27:18,003
Mutual love among friends, good friends,
you know now or not at all.

343
00:27:18,045 --> 00:27:21,089
One question, why
they look ... weird?

344
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:23,175
What kind of dinosaur is that?

345
00:27:23,258 --> 00:27:26,386
Do not know, but it's not the T--Rex.

346
00:27:27,471 --> 00:27:29,473
Of course, safe place.

347
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:32,643
Keamanananya guard I painted recently.

348
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:35,771
Well it's not that I'm worried about.
What is it?

349
00:27:37,414 --> 00:27:39,458
The kids are not here, as did
with a time machine.

350
00:27:40,984 --> 00:27:43,028
So, this is what?

351
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:49,043
This dinosaur eggs.
If I'm not mistaken, this T--Rex.

352
00:27:49,326 --> 00:27:50,327
Mean?

353
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:54,498
No eggs in my garage
of Cretaceous age.

354
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:58,669
It means the transfer system ...
function correctly.

355
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:03,924
That means the kids succeed
create a functioning time machine.

356
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:06,969
Sorry?

357
00:28:07,094 --> 00:28:10,138
They go back to the future
millions of years ago.

358
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:13,225
Sorry???

359
00:28:13,267 --> 00:28:17,396
-- Do not panic Sue ...
-- What exactly are you saying?

360
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,077
-- I really hate this place.
-- Will you shut up!

361
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:36,248
Mr. Sarco, Mr. Sarco more!

362
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:40,419
We are back.
Your right hand is back.

363
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,548
Mr. Sarco, Mr. Sarco Others?

364
00:28:50,388 --> 00:28:53,474
Ah, finally you're here too.

365
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,445
Why are you guys so long?

366
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,616
They go out for a walk.

367
00:29:10,657 --> 00:29:14,828
Let's meet, before
we eat them.

368
00:29:15,829 --> 00:29:18,916
Do not eat me, I'm just fat.

369
00:29:20,042 --> 00:29:24,171
If we do not immediately move out of here,
we had no choice.

370
00:29:25,255 --> 00:29:31,511
Without the presence of the earthquake and Tyra.

371
00:29:31,553 --> 00:29:35,599
Immediately, and there will not be any
in this valley will survive.

372
00:29:35,682 --> 00:29:40,896
When we get Tyra, then the
will we get the other as well.

373
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,068
We need eggs,
That is what you've come.

374
00:29:46,109 --> 00:29:49,196
You'd better bring good news.

375
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,368
Or you would hope we take
you in just one bite.

376
00:29:57,538 --> 00:30:00,624
Boss we have some good news.

377
00:30:00,707 --> 00:30:02,150
The news that will make you happy.

378
00:30:02,251 --> 00:30:04,295
I saw the baby, it's all three.

379
00:30:04,296 --> 00:30:05,353
Yeahh ..

380
00:30:05,879 --> 00:30:10,008
They are really funny.
You'll want to squeeze his cheeks.

381
00:30:10,092 --> 00:30:11,393
Another adoption?

382
00:30:11,635 --> 00:30:14,421
Instead, he said they were his own son.

383
00:30:14,763 --> 00:30:17,307
And it seems there is still one more egg in there.

384
00:30:18,433 --> 00:30:20,477
Another egg?

385
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:24,648
If the egg is taken, he will look for it here.

386
00:30:24,731 --> 00:30:29,820
Then we will get rid of
him forever.

387
00:30:58,015 --> 00:31:00,142
The first night my babies.

388
00:31:01,143 --> 00:31:04,229
I can not wait to teach
I know nothing.

389
00:31:04,313 --> 00:31:10,483
And one day see them
saurus being his first defeat.

390
00:31:11,612 --> 00:31:16,742
Looks like they will be hard to do
it, but it may be?

391
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:19,953
-- All right, go to sleep.
-- No it does not.

392
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:39,806
Now it's time to go to
search for power key.

393
00:31:39,848 --> 00:31:40,766
No way!

394
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:45,979
You will not leave me alone,
millions of years ago and in the middle of the night.

395
00:31:46,063 --> 00:31:51,193
All right, but we left early.
Before the mother dino up.

396
00:31:55,364 --> 00:31:57,449
Sue, could you a little peace of mind!

397
00:31:57,491 --> 00:32:02,663
No, I would mengguncangmu
again, after I took a breath.

398
00:32:03,705 --> 00:32:03,747
Hear.

399
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:08,961
Time machine has a system for
re automatically in three hours.

400
00:32:09,002 --> 00:32:11,046
... To reduce unnecessary distractions.

401
00:32:11,088 --> 00:32:13,131
Thus, the time machine will
appeared in, five ...

402
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:19,304
... Four, three, two, one!

403
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:22,474
I think the clock is broken.

404
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:24,560
Okay, now we're into Plan B.

405
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:27,688
-- What is plan B?
-- Start thinking about a plan C.

406
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,413
Hear, as scientifically.

407
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:48,300
Is not the key to better search
performed three people than just the two?

408
00:32:49,626 --> 00:32:52,754
-- Did you see something?
-- There was nothing here.

409
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:56,925
Did you hear it?

410
00:32:56,967 --> 00:32:57,926
Hear what?

411
00:33:00,053 --> 00:33:01,054
It!

412
00:33:01,096 --> 00:33:04,182
I'm sure a strange dinosaur again.

413
00:33:04,224 --> 00:33:08,312
Her voice is very strange, they came!

414
00:33:11,481 --> 00:33:14,568
Maybe you're right.

415
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:18,780
Hey, wait for me!

416
00:33:24,036 --> 00:33:25,037
I caught you!

417
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:29,166
You can thank me later.

418
00:33:51,146 --> 00:33:53,148
Oh mother would be very upset.

419
00:33:54,274 --> 00:33:56,276
Ernie, what would we do?

420
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,403
Capture the tree!

421
00:34:08,872 --> 00:34:12,960
I do not want to lose my brother.
I've just met, wait for me!!

422
00:34:20,342 --> 00:34:21,385
What will we
do now?

423
00:34:22,386 --> 00:34:23,470
Enjoy the journey!

424
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,470
Look out!

425
00:35:26,033 --> 00:35:28,076
Great rock!

426
00:35:31,205 --> 00:35:33,248
Max, hold on to Julia.

427
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:36,418
What would you do?

428
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,503
I'll show you a new kind of sport.

429
00:35:52,643 --> 00:35:53,644
Gosh.

430
00:35:57,314 --> 00:35:59,358
Ernie!

431
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,401
Perfect!

432
00:36:17,084 --> 00:36:19,211
Well, once again I explained the plan.

433
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:23,340
I swear, if you do not get it.
You will feel the consequences.

434
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:26,426
Even though you do not understand, pretend.

435
00:36:26,468 --> 00:36:30,681
We will be sneaking into the nest,
when he went we took the eggs.

436
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:36,854
I'll settle for looking for something,
I was a good penyelinap.

437
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,982
Aw, something bit me.

438
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:43,193
Where the poor animals
who want to bite you?

439
00:36:44,194 --> 00:36:45,237
Help him to pull.

440
00:36:45,279 --> 00:36:49,449
I? Why should I do it?
And not you?

441
00:36:49,491 --> 00:36:52,578
Because I was the leader, understand!
Not you.

442
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:54,963
One day I'm gonna slap him.

443
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:58,792
Geli ... amused ..

444
00:36:59,835 --> 00:37:01,920
Be quiet, big feet.

445
00:37:01,962 --> 00:37:03,405
This thing involves
between your fingers.

446
00:37:04,006 --> 00:37:05,007
I think the gecko.

447
00:37:10,345 --> 00:37:12,691
Why did you not immediately
Interesting that thing!!??

448
00:37:12,816 --> 00:37:14,616
We have jobs.

449
00:37:17,061 --> 00:37:18,645
Yeah, we never fail.

450
00:37:34,244 --> 00:37:36,288
-- Skill?
-- 350!

451
00:37:36,371 --> 00:37:37,372
Buuyaa!

452
00:37:47,841 --> 00:37:50,928
Ernie? Is he being
joking with me?

453
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:51,970
Ernie, Ernie, Ernie?

454
00:37:53,096 --> 00:37:54,097
Wow, he can talk.

455
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:58,227
He repeats what we say.
Incredible!!

456
00:37:59,269 --> 00:38:02,439
Good work, helping us
from the rocky waters earlier.

457
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:05,526
I'll call you, Dodger!

458
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:10,697
Dodger? Dodger, Dodger!

459
00:38:29,591 --> 00:38:33,637
See it, Alamosaurus!

460
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,722
The creature was like to live forever.

461
00:38:36,507 --> 00:38:40,719
I told Tyra, do not eat when pregnant
red meat. Now, they are at blurred.

462
00:38:43,105 --> 00:38:46,733
Lambeosaurus, calm them vegetarian.

463
00:38:46,775 --> 00:38:50,320
Dude, now you're diligent exercise?

464
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:52,990
I will be able to survive.
Once completed.

465
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:55,534
Hey, Pterodactyl!

466
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:03,959
The creatures will protect
us from Sarco, I doubt it?

467
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,004
Enough to protect her, let's go.

468
00:39:10,257 --> 00:39:13,302
This incredible great!

469
00:39:13,343 --> 00:39:18,515
And you'll never see it,
if I do not break the rules mother.

470
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,685
Well, all of this really worth it.
Now we can go back home.

471
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:24,771
-- What? Back to the nest?
-- No, go back to ...

472
00:39:27,983 --> 00:39:29,943
-- Ha?
-- What is it?

473
00:39:30,428 --> 00:39:32,770
No, I think I'm ...

474
00:39:34,156 --> 00:39:36,200
Apparently, the mother managed to find us.

475
00:39:45,726 --> 00:39:47,853
We recommend that you regret
deeds, Orphan.

476
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:50,797
I thought I could trust
my babies to you

477
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:55,010
-- They can get stuck in the bottom of the valley, and if Sarco ...
-- Hey, I always notice them.

478
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,496
At least my eyes keep eye
other malicious ...

479
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,266
But Mom, the kids are testing you,
you're a good mother, so do I.

480
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:02,309
Then?

481
00:40:02,392 --> 00:40:05,437
If they begin to wonder
to play itself ...

482
00:40:05,521 --> 00:40:08,866
.. Time to teach them survive
without me, they are keepers.

483
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:13,737
Mom, they really liked me, and they
Dodger call me, I love it.

484
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:29,962
-- Ernie, Ernie, Ernie?
-- I'll be there Dodger, but I have to find ...

485
00:40:29,962 --> 00:40:33,549
-- I have to find its key.
-- Key to Power!

486
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:37,803
Do not misunderstand me, you and your mother both
once, and this place was incredible.

487
00:40:38,804 --> 00:40:40,931
It's about the other house.

488
00:40:41,974 --> 00:40:45,102
Home? Home, home ...

489
00:40:46,103 --> 00:40:50,274
Anyone who says that her babies
Tyra could scare ...

490
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:00,659
Yeah!

491
00:41:35,152 --> 00:41:36,153
Fabulous!

492
00:41:48,707 --> 00:41:49,708
Buuyaa!

493
00:42:33,544 --> 00:42:35,546
've Thought of something?

494
00:42:35,629 --> 00:42:39,800
I'm afraid Max stuck in
Among the many dinosaurs, and you?

495
00:42:40,801 --> 00:42:42,886
Did not you become scientists?

496
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:45,013
Yeah, I'm the scientist.

497
00:42:46,014 --> 00:42:50,143
And I had to think of a way to restore
children like my way of solving scientific problems.

498
00:42:53,313 --> 00:42:54,314
Alright.

499
00:42:54,398 --> 00:42:58,485
Time to move to the side of the machine
others in the same position.

500
00:43:02,698 --> 00:43:05,826
-- So that the kids get back to us.
-- Wait!

501
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:08,912
Why do they have to come back to us?

502
00:43:09,997 --> 00:43:11,039
Is that a trick question?

503
00:43:11,081 --> 00:43:14,167
Instead, we can
come to them.

504
00:43:14,209 --> 00:43:15,210
We do not have a time machine to another.

505
00:43:15,294 --> 00:43:17,254
But you managed to get it.

506
00:43:17,337 --> 00:43:20,382
Yeah, but it took four years of probation.

507
00:43:20,424 --> 00:43:24,636
That's because you do not have
an exemplary mother with you.

508
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,723
"Mother Rule"

509
00:44:53,267 --> 00:44:57,396
Please, give me half an hour
to find its key.

510
00:45:05,779 --> 00:45:10,208
I had to find its key, and
I do not want you to forbid it.

511
00:45:32,931 --> 00:45:35,934
-- Max, where Ernie?
-- Ernie?

512
00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:38,020
-- Ernie?
-- I do not know.

513
00:45:38,103 --> 00:45:39,346
I do not know!
I do not know!

514
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:45,903
Ernie, what happened to you?

515
00:45:45,944 --> 00:45:48,488
Him, punishing ...

516
00:45:53,744 --> 00:45:55,787
Ernie, Ernie, Ernie ...

517
00:45:57,873 --> 00:46:01,043
Ernie, Max, Max again, dino mom ...

518
00:46:01,084 --> 00:46:02,085
I ..., Dodger.

519
00:46:03,029 --> 00:46:04,872
Hey, look!

520
00:46:06,215 --> 00:46:08,258
Did you ever find
trail like this before?

521
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,969
-- Not.
-- They are all around the nest.

522
00:46:11,011 --> 00:46:13,555
There seems to be a
're stalking us.

523
00:46:13,597 --> 00:46:15,557
I know where they go.

524
00:46:25,025 --> 00:46:27,027
Julia, come here!

525
00:46:28,111 --> 00:46:31,198
The traces are from
river, let us follow.

526
00:46:36,495 --> 00:46:38,880
Hey Mom, are you going to let
we leave the nest?

527
00:46:39,581 --> 00:46:41,667
Well, I also want to see
where did this trail.

528
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:43,752
And, good enough for their practice.

529
00:46:44,795 --> 00:46:46,838
Exercise, nice bu.

530
00:46:46,964 --> 00:46:48,223
That's why you become a mother!

531
00:46:54,221 --> 00:46:56,223
The place is secure.

532
00:46:57,307 --> 00:46:59,351
Come down, fast fast!

533
00:47:03,564 --> 00:47:04,606
Fast, calm down.

534
00:47:05,649 --> 00:47:06,733
Be careful not to drop it.

535
00:47:06,775 --> 00:47:07,734
Try not to ...

536
00:47:12,948 --> 00:47:14,992
I caught it, take care of their eggs.

537
00:47:16,118 --> 00:47:19,162
If you mess it up, then
you're in trouble. Come quickly.

538
00:47:19,246 --> 00:47:21,290
Hold up, hard to manage them.

539
00:47:21,373 --> 00:47:23,375
Do not stop,
you should fast.

540
00:47:31,117 --> 00:47:33,160
Are there tracks, Julia?

541
00:47:33,202 --> 00:47:37,415
Yes, this trail is much longer, and
I think there are three different tracks here.

542
00:47:38,056 --> 00:47:40,017
And they walked together.

543
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,102
You're terrific.

544
00:47:42,144 --> 00:47:45,614
Almost everything I know,
I learned while spying on Ernie.

545
00:47:48,442 --> 00:47:52,571
Ernie what's up?
You are acting strange.

546
00:47:52,613 --> 00:47:56,700
-- Listen friend, I actually have ...
-- Hey, look at this!

547
00:47:56,783 --> 00:47:58,869
Friends, friends, friends ...

548
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:06,126
The trail comes
from down there.

549
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:08,253
Located on the valley floor.

550
00:48:08,295 --> 00:48:09,296
Let's check it.

551
00:48:12,182 --> 00:48:13,225
Apparently not.

552
00:48:13,508 --> 00:48:17,596
What's the problem? We can handle
whatever is down there.

553
00:48:21,367 --> 00:48:22,609
I guess he will not be
let us go.

554
00:48:22,851 --> 00:48:25,896
Is this what you feel when
mother said no, Ernie?

555
00:48:25,979 --> 00:48:30,067
He really knows the place
this, we should stick with it.

556
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:32,194
Does your head hit something?

557
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,322
If it is better than the nest.

558
00:48:37,407 --> 00:48:40,577
Listen, we have to keep
baby better.

559
00:48:41,578 --> 00:48:42,663
-- Once they get down to the valley floor.
-- Not!

560
00:48:43,664 --> 00:48:45,749
Not to the valley floor, Sarco
brothers there.

561
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:49,920
They have teeth, sharp teeth.
And claw for tearing apart!

562
00:48:49,962 --> 00:48:54,091
Then the earthquake, and the magma
boiling, and the temperature is very hot.

563
00:48:54,132 --> 00:48:55,533
We will find a way out.

564
00:49:07,688 --> 00:49:09,773
I can not believe my car?

565
00:49:10,774 --> 00:49:12,860
Yes, it looks good does not it?

566
00:49:13,902 --> 00:49:16,989
You know I never worked
this fast in my life.

567
00:49:17,114 --> 00:49:21,159
Besides, I never saved
my son at the time of the Cretaceous.

568
00:49:21,243 --> 00:49:23,328
Simply wonderful to see you work.

569
00:49:24,371 --> 00:49:26,656
You know, you make me do it.

570
00:49:27,499 --> 00:49:31,587
I've given up, before
you yell loudly at me.

571
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:32,671
Sorry.

572
00:49:33,714 --> 00:49:35,757
I can see where Ernie
gain energy.

573
00:49:35,841 --> 00:49:36,842
True.

574
00:49:37,968 --> 00:49:39,928
For team work?

575
00:49:40,012 --> 00:49:43,098
Oh, I do not ...
But why not?

576
00:49:48,312 --> 00:49:50,397
Maybe we should sneak
and go down there.

577
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,440
Julia!

578
00:49:51,481 --> 00:49:54,526
Max, they are dinosaurs.
They can not understand us.

579
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:56,612
We could be in trouble.

580
00:49:58,580 --> 00:49:59,623
The power key.

581
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:04,294
I thought it would never
get it again!

582
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:07,080
I mean ...

583
00:50:07,122 --> 00:50:10,250
Wait, you think you do not
will get it again?

584
00:50:10,292 --> 00:50:11,251
What do you mean?

585
00:50:12,336 --> 00:50:16,506
I saw and took it, then
keep it in my pants pocket.

586
00:50:16,531 --> 00:50:18,031
You what?

587
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:20,177
You're in a hurry to go home while
I still want to be here.

588
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:23,764
I'm not ready to go back to the mother,
regulations, and be punished.

589
00:50:24,806 --> 00:50:25,849
Can you trust me?

590
00:50:25,891 --> 00:50:29,019
So in other words, you
keep us here?

591
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,147
We could have been eaten by something.

592
00:50:33,148 --> 00:50:35,275
And almost wish we
stay here forever.

593
00:50:35,317 --> 00:50:37,319
It's like the mother says Ernie ...

594
00:50:37,361 --> 00:50:41,448
You do not care what happens to
others as long as you can have fun.

595
00:50:41,532 --> 00:50:45,661
Well, I found the key to power.
So let's go.

596
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,961
Time machine!

597
00:50:56,171 --> 00:50:58,173
Hey, I do not hide it.

598
00:50:58,257 --> 00:51:01,260
We'll never get home.

599
00:51:02,344 --> 00:51:03,387
Julia, we'll be fine.

600
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:06,515
It's all your fault.

601
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:11,687
I miss mom, and you
no, right Ernie?

602
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:12,813
Of course I miss him.

603
00:51:16,942 --> 00:51:21,071
-- My baby is unfortunate. -- What's the problem?
It's just an egg--shaped object.

604
00:51:27,712 --> 00:51:30,397
Tyra Why not come here?

605
00:51:30,581 --> 00:51:34,626
I think he's concerned with this thing.

606
00:51:35,752 --> 00:51:37,796
It could be because we do
good job.

607
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:40,924
Our team of experts, until he
do not know the eggs disappeared.

608
00:51:41,008 --> 00:51:42,509
Are not we great?

609
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:48,182
He did not come, because he
more concerned with her babies.

610
00:51:48,265 --> 00:51:53,395
They are really funny.
And so pink.

611
00:51:56,607 --> 00:51:59,693
Let me eat it.

612
00:51:59,776 --> 00:52:01,778
If they fail to
The next mission.

613
00:52:01,862 --> 00:52:06,992
Give our babies
Tyra, then he will come.

614
00:52:14,775 --> 00:52:16,861
Well, should we
not planning something?

615
00:52:17,702 --> 00:52:18,662
Like what?

616
00:52:19,204 --> 00:52:23,375
Wish we could live 100 years
again, so that we can meet the mother?

617
00:52:26,703 --> 00:52:27,704
Wait ...

618
00:52:27,888 --> 00:52:30,933
Ernie, you're a genius!

619
00:52:31,016 --> 00:52:33,018
What are you talking about?

620
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:37,272
Julia, the mother asked what we do
if we leave the house when she was not there?

621
00:52:38,357 --> 00:52:39,358
Leave a message?

622
00:52:40,442 --> 00:52:41,401
True!

623
00:52:42,344 --> 00:52:44,971
What if we carve
message to his father Max ...

624
00:52:45,572 --> 00:52:48,659
Shows ... what to do
that time machine works.

625
00:52:48,742 --> 00:52:49,743
Functioning ...

626
00:52:50,786 --> 00:52:51,787
That?

627
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:54,915
Splash of soda in the control panel.

628
00:52:54,998 --> 00:52:58,126
True, we'll carve
in a place easily seen.

629
00:52:59,127 --> 00:53:02,214
Prominent place, such as a building.

630
00:53:02,339 --> 00:53:05,384
Always place we see every day.

631
00:53:07,511 --> 00:53:08,554
Mystery rock!

632
00:53:09,555 --> 00:53:10,556
Exactly!

633
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:11,682
Alright.

634
00:53:12,766 --> 00:53:17,855
It is finished? Are you ready? It is finished? Can be tried?
I mean, this started to affect me soda.

635
00:53:21,024 --> 00:53:23,052
Now we just try it.

636
00:53:23,077 --> 00:53:24,093
Come on!

637
00:53:24,194 --> 00:53:25,195
Hopefully these things work.

638
00:53:36,748 --> 00:53:37,749
I do not understand.

639
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:40,235
I made the same
with the previous one.

640
00:53:40,836 --> 00:53:42,880
Which previously was
does not work, is not it?

641
00:53:42,921 --> 00:53:46,091
You're right, it means that the children do
something on his time machine.

642
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:30,610
Oow ...

643
00:54:34,657 --> 00:54:38,779
Wow, Dr. Santiago careful, we are in a hurry
but these houses are our neighbors.

644
00:54:38,805 --> 00:54:39,854
Call me Diego.

645
00:54:52,483 --> 00:54:56,053
Be careful Ernie, I hate you but
I do not want to see your legs broken.

646
00:54:56,654 --> 00:54:58,739
Julia, it certainly succeeded.
I'm sure.

647
00:55:02,752 --> 00:55:06,839
-- I want you to catch it.
-- Go, rock climbing it.

648
00:55:07,422 --> 00:55:09,424
I think it should
he did it.

649
00:55:16,807 --> 00:55:17,808
Ernie!

650
00:55:18,851 --> 00:55:19,852
Ernie.

651
00:55:23,021 --> 00:55:24,022
Thank you.

652
00:55:24,064 --> 00:55:25,148
Thank you.
Thank you.

653
00:55:38,662 --> 00:55:39,705
Julia!

654
00:55:40,747 --> 00:55:41,832
-- Hold this ...
-- It?

655
00:55:41,874 --> 00:55:42,833
Here you are.

656
00:55:49,172 --> 00:55:51,216
Hang in there, Julia!

657
00:55:52,301 --> 00:55:55,387
I never omit
key, then the time machine.

658
00:55:55,429 --> 00:55:58,432
But I'm not going to
to miss my brother!

659
00:56:08,901 --> 00:56:10,944
Ernie!

660
00:56:12,029 --> 00:56:15,157
Let's quickly run!
Before we catch something.

661
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,286
Restore my baby!

662
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:22,156
Restore my best friend's sister!

663
00:56:39,139 --> 00:56:40,140
Oh no!

664
00:56:49,508 --> 00:56:51,593
Follow the thief!

665
00:57:01,078 --> 00:57:02,120
Oh great!

666
00:58:30,709 --> 00:58:31,752
Sorry ...

667
00:58:31,793 --> 00:58:36,924
Have you ever seen a baby reptile times
pre--history with sharp little teeth?

668
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:40,052
Right over there.

669
00:58:42,638 --> 00:58:43,638
Oow ..

670
00:58:44,264 --> 00:58:46,308
Call for animal catcher!

671
00:58:46,891 --> 00:58:47,992
Hold on.

672
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,364
This way, right?

673
00:58:55,734 --> 00:58:58,820
My shop, my stuff!

674
00:59:03,033 --> 00:59:07,162
We should set him up with something.
Go to the "Drive Thru"!

675
00:59:10,875 --> 00:59:14,503
<i> -- Welcome to Burgersaurus. </ i>
-- I need 50 burger, do as fast as you can!

676
00:59:14,586 --> 00:59:19,716
-- Are you going to buy a promotional pack or regular.
-- You hear, 50 burgers!

677
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,803
And two large sodas.

678
00:59:33,313 --> 00:59:35,315
Thanks for the ride.

679
00:59:35,399 --> 00:59:37,484
Trail, I could follow it.

680
00:59:53,083 --> 00:59:55,127
No, it's a trap!

681
00:59:56,211 --> 00:59:58,839
Welcome to our home, Tyra.

682
00:59:58,881 --> 01:00:01,466
Note, you need
more than courage.

683
01:00:07,681 --> 01:00:08,682
Julia?

684
01:00:19,151 --> 01:00:20,152
Julia!

685
01:00:29,578 --> 01:00:33,707
Masamu in this valley is over, Tyra.

686
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:35,876
We will take over the place, now.

687
01:00:49,389 --> 01:00:50,432
The time machine.

688
01:00:50,817 --> 01:00:54,061
You've got two babies to be protected.

689
01:00:54,645 --> 01:00:57,731
It will make you hard
protect yourself.

690
01:01:03,987 --> 01:01:08,116
-- Sorry, Julia. I can not save you.
-- Where's Ernie?

691
01:01:08,242 --> 01:01:09,201
I do not know.

692
01:01:13,455 --> 01:01:16,458
Geez, I must be doing something.

693
01:01:24,883 --> 01:01:25,926
Come on Tyra.

694
01:01:26,969 --> 01:01:31,098
Give it up, and we'll make it easier.

695
01:01:31,181 --> 01:01:33,141
Not ever!

696
01:01:33,225 --> 01:01:35,269
If so, we would
doing it the hard way.

697
01:01:59,293 --> 01:02:01,336
Come on, get outta here!

698
01:02:05,591 --> 01:02:08,635
Find out where the noise was.

699
01:02:08,719 --> 01:02:11,162
Try not to eat.

700
01:02:11,847 --> 01:02:13,849
That's a great suggestion.

701
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,020
Come on!

702
01:02:21,148 --> 01:02:23,233
Let's take, little baby.

703
01:02:27,404 --> 01:02:28,488
Rightly so.

704
01:02:31,575 --> 01:02:34,845
Hemh, if you see me gathering,
they would cancel my appreciation.

705
01:02:35,746 --> 01:02:36,830
What are friends for?

706
01:02:38,874 --> 01:02:40,959
-- Come on, take it.
-- Almost there ...

707
01:02:42,085 --> 01:02:43,045
A few steps away.

708
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,600
Got you!

709
01:03:03,499 --> 01:03:04,500
Tyra baby!

710
01:03:18,539 --> 01:03:19,498
Oh no.

711
01:03:35,264 --> 01:03:39,393
-- Finally, I know we can ...
-- Handing on Sarco.

712
01:03:39,434 --> 01:03:42,437
I assure you it and of course.

713
01:03:50,521 --> 01:03:53,607
Tyra would jump in front of me?
Wait, Tyra will jump in front of me?

714
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:02,249
Buuyaa!

715
01:04:02,332 --> 01:04:05,419
-- Dodger!
-- Ernie!

716
01:04:06,461 --> 01:04:09,590
The final goal!
Let's find a mother dinosaur!

717
01:04:09,631 --> 01:04:12,718
I wish there was a female voice on the island.

718
01:04:14,887 --> 01:04:17,931
Perfect, should you
do in this situation?

719
01:04:19,057 --> 01:04:21,018
Does it smell?

720
01:04:22,144 --> 01:04:23,187
Yeah!

721
01:04:25,314 --> 01:04:27,274
It was brilliant!

722
01:04:27,357 --> 01:04:30,444
It's like the Max plan
he learned from Ernie.

723
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:34,615
He was a smart kid
and I let him down!

724
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:39,786
Alright, let's settle this problem.

725
01:04:39,912 --> 01:04:40,871
Let's go.

726
01:04:45,968 --> 01:04:47,928
We found a starting place it happened!

727
01:04:49,213 --> 01:04:50,214
Ernie!

728
01:04:50,297 --> 01:04:51,298
Hey friends!

729
01:04:53,383 --> 01:04:54,927
Friends ... friends.

730
01:04:54,968 --> 01:04:56,470
He continued to take care of you.

731
01:04:56,553 --> 01:04:58,555
He fights for us.

732
01:04:58,597 --> 01:05:02,226
Objects against which we
look at the museum, Sarcosuchus.

733
01:05:02,267 --> 01:05:05,854
I knew. And I would like
them in the form of fossils.

734
01:05:17,066 --> 01:05:18,067
Ernie!

735
01:05:32,047 --> 01:05:34,091
Earthquake began.

736
01:05:35,092 --> 01:05:36,093
Time machine!

737
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:39,263
But Mrs. Dino.

738
01:05:56,989 --> 01:05:59,032
Ernie, we do not have much time.

739
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,202
Let's go home.

740
01:06:07,457 --> 01:06:11,587
-- Wait, we can not leave it.
-- No Ernie, let's go!

741
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:13,630
You guys, come on!

742
01:06:13,755 --> 01:06:15,716
Ernie, give me the key!

743
01:06:28,312 --> 01:06:29,313
Dino mother.

744
01:06:31,481 --> 01:06:33,442
Are we sinking?

745
01:06:33,483 --> 01:06:35,611
-- Moderate earthquakes.
-- Let's get out of here!

746
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:53,295
-- Ernie, Ernie, Ernie!
-- Ernie, what is it?

747
01:06:54,421 --> 01:06:58,467
Friends! I know how
meaningful home for you ...

748
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:00,594
... But we can not just leave.

749
01:07:04,806 --> 01:07:09,937
You know Ernie, I will always
is right behind you.

750
01:07:31,517 --> 01:07:32,518
Hemh, watch this!

751
01:07:35,087 --> 01:07:37,130
Dino--Rex Hey, over here!

752
01:07:38,131 --> 01:07:39,132
Was not hit!

753
01:07:47,516 --> 01:07:48,559
Right here!

754
01:07:50,644 --> 01:07:51,728
Earthquake!!

755
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:10,497
You hurt my brothers basis ugly!

756
01:08:15,752 --> 01:08:16,712
Max!

757
01:08:20,924 --> 01:08:21,925
Not!!

758
01:08:36,565 --> 01:08:37,566
Dodger!

759
01:08:58,462 --> 01:09:00,464
Julia, his use of light!

760
01:09:10,974 --> 01:09:12,976
See you at the museum.

761
01:09:18,315 --> 01:09:20,275
Oh tidaak!

762
01:10:29,136 --> 01:10:31,263
Sorry Sue, this machine does not work.

763
01:10:33,348 --> 01:10:36,393
As usual, the failure
Another of Dr. Santiago.

764
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,847
Very difficult to control my son.

765
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:45,819
You know the dinner hour? And when I looked,
how often they were not in his room.

766
01:10:45,903 --> 01:10:51,033
And if Ernie's out, though only in
backyard ... I always make it ...

767
01:10:55,245 --> 01:10:57,247
Leave a message ...

768
01:11:03,587 --> 01:11:04,588
Sue?

769
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:05,589
Wait!

770
01:11:24,441 --> 01:11:25,442
Wait ...

771
01:11:32,741 --> 01:11:33,742
Wait!

772
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,041
Let's go!

773
01:11:50,509 --> 01:11:52,594
Ernie?
Dodger?

774
01:12:31,133 --> 01:12:32,176
Ernie!

775
01:12:32,217 --> 01:12:33,177
Julia!

776
01:12:33,218 --> 01:12:34,219
-- Max!
-- Dad!

777
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,304
Mother!

778
01:12:36,388 --> 01:12:39,474
-- Oh dear.
-- I thought I would never see you again.

779
01:12:40,559 --> 01:12:41,518
Look out!

780
01:12:45,772 --> 01:12:48,817
Everything is down!

781
01:13:04,499 --> 01:13:07,085
You're in trouble with the wrong family.

782
01:13:07,127 --> 01:13:09,713
And now you're gonna die!

783
01:14:19,375 --> 01:14:22,461
Let me know if magmanya too hot Sarco.

784
01:14:39,469 --> 01:14:41,471
Children, sheltering behind me!

785
01:14:41,555 --> 01:14:43,515
Mother, do not!

786
01:14:43,599 --> 01:14:45,642
Ernie, shut up in the back!

787
01:14:46,685 --> 01:14:47,769
You're not going to have my daughter.

788
01:14:50,856 --> 01:14:52,941
Mom, this is not what you think.

789
01:14:53,025 --> 01:14:54,985
Mom, stop!

790
01:14:55,027 --> 01:14:59,198
He found us, he treats
we like his own son.

791
01:14:59,239 --> 01:15:00,199
What?

792
01:15:01,283 --> 01:15:04,411
That's right, he even
to lick our faces.

793
01:15:07,539 --> 01:15:11,710
-- Like that.
-- Disgusting, but very unusual.

794
01:15:16,924 --> 01:15:21,094
You saw bu, wow,
he is their size version.

795
01:15:42,991 --> 01:15:45,118
-- Mom!
-- Dad! -- Max.

796
01:15:46,119 --> 01:15:49,206
Functioning time machine,
as you've said.

797
01:15:49,289 --> 01:15:53,460
And I get the idea
new, namely Sarcosuchus?

798
01:15:53,502 --> 01:15:56,505
-- Yeah.
-- Cool!

799
01:15:58,715 --> 01:16:01,718
He looks sad.

800
01:16:02,886 --> 01:16:04,888
This will make it back smiling.

801
01:16:33,125 --> 01:16:34,384
Let's get out of here!

802
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:38,148
Thank you for taking care of us.
And to not eat us, of course.

803
01:17:38,231 --> 01:17:40,275
Thank you, ma'am.

804
01:17:40,817 --> 01:17:42,903
You know, I'm going to miss this place.

805
01:17:43,987 --> 01:17:47,115
You kissed my plan, sounds of the forest ..

806
01:17:48,116 --> 01:17:49,201
Dinosaur ... battle.

807
01:17:51,245 --> 01:17:52,287
I'll miss you too.

808
01:17:54,373 --> 01:17:55,374
Come on, Ernie!

809
01:17:55,457 --> 01:17:57,501
Once again, thank you for everything.

810
01:17:59,628 --> 01:18:01,672
And beware the threat magmanya.

811
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:08,929
-- Good--bye! Adios!
-- We will miss you. Good--bye!

812
01:18:22,609 --> 01:18:27,781
How do you know that you must
soda splashed on the control panel?

813
01:18:27,823 --> 01:18:29,783
I see the engraving on the stone.

814
01:18:29,867 --> 01:18:33,996
I do not have time to carve!
Because I have to catch Julia, so ...

815
01:18:34,738 --> 01:18:35,739
Who carved it?

816
01:18:36,123 --> 01:18:38,208
Dodger, Dodger, Dodger.

817
01:18:38,233 --> 01:18:41,233
Oow ...
