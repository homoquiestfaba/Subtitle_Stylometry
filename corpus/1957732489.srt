383
00:23:03,407 --> 00:23:08,045
You didn't come out all this way
just to catch up, now, did you?

384
00:23:11,548 --> 00:23:13,450
Well, it's a locust.

385
00:23:13,483 --> 00:23:16,586
Mandibles, wings, thorax, but...

386
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,888
God, the size of it is massive.

387
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:20,424
-(cage clinks)
-(wings fluttering)

388
00:23:20,457 --> 00:23:23,493
It has genes that have been
extinct since the Cretaceous,

389
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,629
and swarms of them
are decimating crops

390
00:23:25,662 --> 00:23:27,397
from Iowa to Texas.

391
00:23:27,431 --> 00:23:29,433
Terrifying, right?

392
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,035
Started as a few hundred.

393
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:34,204
There could be millions
by the end of the summer.

394
00:23:34,237 --> 00:23:35,871
If they keep going,

395
00:23:35,905 --> 00:23:38,542
there will be no grain
to feed chickens, cattle.

396
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:40,610
The entire food chain
would collapse.

397
00:23:40,644 --> 00:23:45,248
Well, it's clearly designed,
but why would anyone do that?

398
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:50,220
None of the crops they're eating
are Biosyn seed.

399
00:23:50,253 --> 00:23:51,887
Biosyn.

400
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:53,423
You're saying Biosyn made this.

401
00:23:53,457 --> 00:23:55,258
I mean, it would not shock me

402
00:23:55,292 --> 00:23:57,893
that they want to control
the world's food supply.

403
00:23:57,928 --> 00:24:00,364
Not before a few million starve.

404
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,932
Yeah, what is that saying?

405
00:24:01,965 --> 00:24:04,468
Uh, we're three meals away
from anarchy?

406
00:24:04,501 --> 00:24:08,472
If we don't stop them, you can
pick your last three meals.

407
00:24:09,973 --> 00:24:12,008
So why are you
bringing it to me?

408
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:13,677
I need concrete evidence

409
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,946
Biosyn's responsible
for all this.

410
00:24:15,979 --> 00:24:17,581
I need to go to their sanctuary

411
00:24:17,614 --> 00:24:20,283
and get DNA
from another locust there.

412
00:24:21,551 --> 00:24:24,321
But I need a witness.

413
00:24:24,354 --> 00:24:25,489
Alan.

414
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,625

428
00:24:55,318 --> 00:24:56,653

you out of the blue, huh?

00:38:08,778 --> 00:38:10,880
um, later on if we, um...

722
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,915
Oh, we booked you a private pod

723
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,750
-for the trip out, so...
-Right.

724
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,986
It's beautiful. You'll love it.

725
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:17,487
Through the caverns
and everything.

726
00:38:17,521 --> 00:38:19,022
Uh, you better hurry.
Malcolm's on.

727
00:38:19,056 --> 00:38:21,325
He's a bit of a contrarian,
but I like him.

728
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:22,758
He keeps us on our toes.

729
00:38:22,792 --> 00:38:23,961
Anyway...

730
00:38:23,994 --> 00:38:26,129
Thank you for being here.
It's...

731
00:38:28,365 --> 00:38:31,001
Okay, um, follow me, please.

732
00:38:32,502 --> 00:38:34,104
What?

733
00:38:34,137 --> 00:38:39,509
Human beings have no more right
to safety or liberty

734
00:38:39,543 --> 00:38:42,980
than any other creature
on this planet.

735
00:38:44,414 --> 00:38:49,253
We not only lack dominion
over nature,

736
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:51,288
we're subordinate to it.

737
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:53,991
And now here we are

738
00:38:54,024 --> 00:38:57,294
with the opportunity to
rewrite life at our fingertips.

739
00:38:57,327 --> 00:39:00,397
And just like nuclear power,
nobody knew what to expect

740
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:04,201
with genetic engineering,
but they pressed the button

741
00:39:04,234 --> 00:39:07,070
and hoped for the best...

742
00:39:07,104 --> 00:39:10,007
just like you are doing now.

743
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:13,210
Yep. You.

744
00:39:14,344 --> 00:39:19,915
You control the future
of our survival on planet Earth.

745
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,885
According to you,
the solution is genetic power.

746
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:26,290
But that same power could
devastate the food supply,

747
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:28,558
create new diseases,

748
00:39:28,592 --> 00:39:30,926
alter the climate even further.

749
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:34,864
Unforeseen consequences occur.

750
00:39:34,897 --> 00:39:40,203
And every time,
every single time...

751
00:39:41,638 --> 00:39:43,906
...we all act surprised?

752
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,876
Because deep down,
I don't think that any of us

753
00:39:46,909 --> 00:39:50,080
actually believe
that these dangers are real.

754
00:39:50,113 --> 00:39:51,847
(door opens)

755
00:39:57,354 --> 00:40:01,058
In order to instigate
revolutionary change,

756
00:40:01,091 --> 00:40:07,197
we must transform
human consciousness.

757
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,299
(applause)

758
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:11,401
(cheering)

759
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:15,972
-Mayam?
-Mm-hmm.

760
00:40:16,006 --> 00:40:17,641
-OTHERS: Dr. Malcolm?
-Very good.

761
00:40:17,674 --> 00:40:19,276
There-there you go.

762
00:40:19,309 --> 00:40:21,311
Hey, I don't want to be rude
to my friends. Thank you.

763
00:40:21,345 --> 00:40:23,613
Catch me on my way out.
Thanks, everybody.

764
00:40:23,647 --> 00:40:25,082
Look at you,

765
00:40:25,115 --> 00:40:29,019
and look at me, and look at you.

766
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:30,886
Wow, this is so trippy.

767
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,989
You look like you're doing well.

768
00:40:33,023 --> 00:40:34,358
Well, I got five kids, you know,

769
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:36,493
whom I adore
more than life itself, so...

770
00:40:36,526 --> 00:40:38,061
uh, expenses add up.

771
00:40:38,095 --> 00:40:40,497
You, Alan? Are you... are you...

772
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,566
You have any family or...?

773
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:43,600
No.

774
00:40:43,633 --> 00:40:46,069
So, uh, I need to talk to you.

775
00:40:46,103 --> 00:40:47,637
Yeah, I need to talk
to you, too.

776
00:40:47,671 --> 00:40:50,140
-Privately.
-Do you two talk a lot?

777
00:40:50,173 --> 00:40:52,275
-Uh, he slid into my DMs.
-He did what?

778
00:40:52,309 --> 00:40:54,578
-It's urgent, Ian.
-What did you do?

779
00:40:54,611 --> 00:40:56,279
"Seven minutes to midnight"
stuff.

780
00:40:56,313 --> 00:40:58,682
Uh, the Doomsday Clock
might be about out of time,

781
00:40:58,715 --> 00:41:01,518
but as they say,
it's always darkest

782
00:41:01,551 --> 00:41:04,321
just before eternal nothingness.

783
00:41:04,354 --> 00:41:05,989
What?

784
00:41:07,524 --> 00:41:10,994
ELLIE: Locusts,
altered with Cretaceous-era DNA.

785
00:41:11,027 --> 00:41:12,329
IAN:
Yeah, that's not my field.

786
00:41:12,362 --> 00:41:14,364
Yeah, but if these things
continue to multiply,

787
00:41:14,398 --> 00:41:17,401
we're talking about cascading
system-wide effects, Ian.

788
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:19,035
Gosh, that's a drag.

789
00:41:19,069 --> 00:41:21,104
What is the matter with you?

790
00:41:21,138 --> 00:41:23,073
Why? Is there something special
you want me to do?

791
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:24,274
Yeah, how about give a damn?

792
00:41:24,307 --> 00:41:25,976
You know far too much
not to care.

793
00:41:26,009 --> 00:41:29,413
Hey, I-I gave my opinion
robustly for years.

794
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:31,415
As expected,
the sum of our human endeavors

795
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:34,684
has led to our annihilation,
and the only play now

796
00:41:34,718 --> 00:41:37,354
is to take the time
that we have left and, uh,

797
00:41:37,387 --> 00:41:39,689
you know, just like
we always do, squander it.

798
00:41:39,723 --> 00:41:42,959
Honestly, Ian, that's bullshit.

799
00:41:42,993 --> 00:41:45,128
Can I offer you guys some joe?

800
00:41:45,162 --> 00:41:49,032
Uh, Tyler, please,
two cappuccinos.

801
00:41:49,065 --> 00:41:50,534
I don't want a cappuccino.

802
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:52,335
Uh, well, I could do, like,
a cortado or, like, macchiato.

803
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:54,438
Trust me, it's real tough,
that jet lag.

804
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:55,572
It's gonna perk you right up.

805
00:41:55,605 --> 00:41:57,941
(milk steamer whirring loudly)

806
00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:01,745
(hushed): The locusts are part
of a larger project

807
00:42:01,778 --> 00:42:03,580
called Hexapod Allies.

808
00:42:03,613 --> 00:42:05,115
You're right about their intent.

809
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:07,384
I started hearing rumors
six weeks ago.

810
00:42:07,417 --> 00:42:09,719
I read your piece on decadence
and put two and two together.

811
00:42:09,753 --> 00:42:11,354
I was not raising my voice.

812
00:42:11,388 --> 00:42:13,056
You're beginning to.
It's crescendoing, isn't it?

813
00:42:13,089 --> 00:42:14,591
(hushed):
They're proliferating wildly.

814
00:42:14,624 --> 00:42:16,760
They're lasting three, four
times longer than they should.

815
00:42:16,793 --> 00:42:19,129
And all my models
are pointing toward a global

816
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:20,697
ecological collapse, Ian.

817
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,332
Downstairs, sublevel six.

818
00:42:22,365 --> 00:42:24,468
That's where they keep
the locusts.

819
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:26,369
Look for a lab marked L4.

820
00:42:26,403 --> 00:42:28,271
But wait, how are we ever
gonna get down there?

821
00:42:28,305 --> 00:42:30,073
-(whirring stops)
-Hey, this looks so silky.

822
00:42:30,106 --> 00:42:31,708
May I touch this blouse,
by any chance?

823
00:42:31,741 --> 00:42:33,343
-Sure.
-You know what it is?

824
00:42:33,376 --> 00:42:35,145
-Don't tell... Don't tell me.
-You won't know it.

825
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:37,180
This is sustainable bamboo.

826
00:42:37,214 --> 00:42:39,149
-It is sustainable bamboo.
-That's why I said it.

827
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,550
-How did you know that?
-I just know it.

828
00:42:40,584 --> 00:42:42,219
-Yeah, it's amazing.
-TYLER: I've got cumin.

829
00:42:42,252 --> 00:42:43,553
-It's very amazing.
-I've got cinnamon.

830
00:42:43,587 --> 00:42:45,255
I've got allspice,
which is not very popular.

831
00:42:45,288 --> 00:42:46,756
-I've got five-spice.
-Doctor.

832
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,091
TYLER: Um, if you're into
that kind of feel.

833
00:42:48,124 --> 00:42:51,027
-Um, and let's talk milks.
-Yeah.

834
00:42:51,061 --> 00:42:53,096
TYLER:
Okay. Soy milk, yes?

835
00:42:53,129 --> 00:42:54,397
(Ellie gasps)

836
00:42:54,431 --> 00:42:57,033
-TYLER: No.
-What just happened?

837
00:42:57,067 --> 00:42:59,002
We're in.

838
00:43:00,604 --> 00:43:03,006
♪ ♪

AUTOMATED VOICE:
Sublevel six. Restricted.

840
00:43:21,157 --> 00:43:23,760
HENRY: Lewis,
you're not listening to me.

841
00:43:23,793 --> 00:43:25,762
The locusts' prehistoric DNA
has made them

842
00:43:25,795 --> 00:43:27,531
stronger than they should be.

843
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:30,300
They're multiplying like crazy,
and they're not dying.

844
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:31,801
What part of this
don't you understand?

845
00:43:31,835 --> 00:43:33,203
Oh, I do understand.

846
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:35,105
This is gonna be
a global famine.

847
00:43:35,138 --> 00:43:36,806
Hey, hey, we can't
anticipate everything.

848
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,543
We need to eradicate
the ones we released.

849
00:43:39,576 --> 00:43:41,278
-What?
-All of them.

850
00:43:41,311 --> 00:43:43,580
-No. No. Henry.
-Like... like, yesterday.

851
00:43:43,613 --> 00:43:45,348
We don't want to cause a panic.

852
00:43:45,382 --> 00:43:46,816
We want control.

853
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:49,319
There is no such thing.

854
00:43:54,758 --> 00:43:57,193
(sighs)

855
00:44:01,364 --> 00:44:04,701
When we're afraid,
what do we do?

856
00:44:04,734 --> 00:44:06,670
What have we done before?

857
00:44:06,703 --> 00:44:09,573
We follow through.

858
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:11,508
That's what we do.

859
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:13,209
Right?

860
00:44:15,345 --> 00:44:16,680
Right.

861
00:44:19,482 --> 00:44:20,850
We found the girl.

862
00:44:20,884 --> 00:44:22,586
She's en route.

863
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:24,654
-Cost me a fortune.
-What?

864
00:44:24,688 --> 00:44:27,290
-Wait, you found her?
-Yeah, found them both.

865
00:44:27,324 --> 00:44:29,726
Her and the little raptor.

866
00:44:29,759 --> 00:44:32,295
Blue reproduced all on her own.

867
00:44:33,263 --> 00:44:35,432
Just like you said.
You're so smart, Henry.

868
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:37,601
(chuckles softly)

869
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:39,869
That's why this works.

870
00:44:39,903 --> 00:44:42,205
You understand the value
of these creatures.

871
00:44:42,238 --> 00:44:43,740
You always have. I do, too.

872
00:44:43,773 --> 00:44:46,176
And we don't stop
because a, what,

873
00:44:46,209 --> 00:44:48,111
little side project went south?

874
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:53,183
Hey. If they trace
the locusts back to us,

875
00:44:53,216 --> 00:44:54,718
they come for the dinosaurs.

876
00:44:54,751 --> 00:44:56,453
All your work gone.

877
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,457
Billions of dollars
in assets gone.

878
00:45:01,558 --> 00:45:04,561
Diamonds with no one
to mine them.

879
00:45:05,462 --> 00:45:07,697
You really think
she's the solution?

880
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:12,769
Okay.

881
00:45:13,803 --> 00:45:16,439
Everything involving the girl
goes through me, right?

882
00:45:18,308 --> 00:45:19,809
Is she all right?

883
00:45:19,843 --> 00:45:21,378
She better be.

884
00:45:21,979 --> 00:45:23,480
She's the most valuable

885
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:25,682
intellectual property
on the planet.

886
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:32,255
<i>(cell phone ringing)</i>

887
00:45:35,692 --> 00:45:37,260
I said I'd call you.

888
00:45:37,293 --> 00:45:38,528
LEWIS:
They land yet?

889
00:45:38,561 --> 00:45:40,263
(over phone):
Second plane is incoming.

890
00:45:40,296 --> 00:45:41,665
Who said anything
about a second plane?

891
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:42,967
We flew them separately.

892
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,434
I'm not taking any chances.

893
00:45:44,467 --> 00:45:46,836
And we'll need payment
before delivery.

894
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:48,939
I didn't like

to help us understand you.

1254
01:06:06,923 --> 01:06:08,925
MAISIE:
Hey, Beta.

1255
01:06:09,994 --> 01:06:11,761
You okay?

1256
01:06:11,794 --> 01:06:13,063
Did you say "Beta"?

1257
01:06:13,097 --> 01:06:14,764
Is that her name?

1258
01:06:15,765 --> 01:06:17,034
I gave it to her.

1259
01:06:17,067 --> 01:06:18,668
HENRY:
Beta's pretty special.

1260
01:06:18,701 --> 01:06:21,771
You know, when we made Blue,
we used monitor lizard DNA

1261
01:06:21,804 --> 01:06:24,607
to fill in the gaps
in her genome.

1262
01:06:24,641 --> 01:06:27,577
Monitor lizards can reproduce
without a mate,

1263
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:31,547
so Beta and Blue
are genetically identical,

1264
01:06:31,581 --> 01:06:33,650
and that's what they have
in common with you and...

1265
01:06:33,683 --> 01:06:35,551
Charlotte.

1266
01:06:37,687 --> 01:06:39,756
What do you know
about Charlotte?

1267
01:06:39,789 --> 01:06:41,524
She died.

1268
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:43,793
A long time ago.

1269
01:06:44,627 --> 01:06:46,696
It broke my grandpa's heart.

1270
01:06:48,198 --> 01:06:49,934
So he made me.

1271
01:06:51,501 --> 01:06:53,736
No, Maisie, actually, he didn't.

1272
01:06:56,073 --> 01:06:58,508
Charlotte made you.

1273
01:07:00,843 --> 01:07:03,713
I'm so excited for everyone to
see what we've been doing here.

1274
01:07:03,746 --> 01:07:07,051
There's new technology
being made, new science,

1275
01:07:07,084 --> 01:07:08,986
like, every day almost.

1276
01:07:09,019 --> 01:07:10,586
And it's great to be...

1277
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:12,156
it's great to be
in the center...

1278
01:07:12,189 --> 01:07:13,823
center of that.

1279
01:07:13,856 --> 01:07:18,228
HENRY: Charlotte lived
on Site B with all of us.

1280
01:07:18,262 --> 01:07:20,630
Till the storm.

1281
01:07:20,663 --> 01:07:21,966
She loved dinosaurs.

1282
01:07:21,999 --> 01:07:23,566
HENRY (on video):
Charlotte, be careful.

1283
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:24,901
Yeah, I will.

1284
01:07:24,935 --> 01:07:27,037
HENRY:
She grew up around scientists.

1285
01:07:28,005 --> 01:07:30,540
Then, eventually...

1286
01:07:31,175 --> 01:07:32,842
...she became one herself.

1287
01:07:32,875 --> 01:07:34,877
A butterfly flew into
my office this morning.

1288
01:07:34,911 --> 01:07:37,281
They say tiny things
have huge impacts,

1289
01:07:37,314 --> 01:07:39,283
and I agree wholeheartedly.

1290
01:07:39,316 --> 01:07:41,718
She was brilliant.

1291
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,022
In ways that I'll never be.

1292
01:07:45,055 --> 01:07:46,589
In the metaphysics of identity,

1293
01:07:46,622 --> 01:07:48,758
can a replica
truly be the original?

1294
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:52,762
And if it's possible,
what makes it so?

1295
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,669
I've lost my pen.

1296
01:08:02,905 --> 01:08:04,141
Is that me?

1297
01:08:04,174 --> 01:08:06,542
Yeah. (chuckles)

1298
01:08:06,576 --> 01:08:08,245
Just like Blue,
Charlotte was able

1299
01:08:08,278 --> 01:08:10,580
to have a child all by herself.

1300
01:08:11,281 --> 01:08:15,052
She created you
with her own DNA.

1301
01:08:16,053 --> 01:08:18,022
So I do have a mother.

1302
01:08:18,055 --> 01:08:21,557
Your grandfather didn't want
anyone to know the truth.

1303
01:08:21,591 --> 01:08:24,660
He was protecting her and you.

1304
01:08:25,295 --> 01:08:26,930
And we're the same?

1305
01:08:28,898 --> 01:08:29,766
You were.

1306
01:08:29,799 --> 01:08:32,202
When you were a baby,
Charlotte started

1307
01:08:32,236 --> 01:08:34,238
to show symptoms
of a genetic disorder.

1308
01:08:34,271 --> 01:08:36,873
That's how she died.

1309
01:08:36,906 --> 01:08:40,643
She didn't know she had it
until after you were born.

1310
01:08:40,676 --> 01:08:42,712
Do I have it, too?

1311
01:08:42,745 --> 01:08:43,780
No.

1312
01:08:43,813 --> 01:08:46,183
She changed your DNA.

1313
01:08:46,216 --> 01:08:49,053
She altered every cell
in your body

1314
01:08:49,086 --> 01:08:51,121
to eradicate this disease.

1315
01:08:51,155 --> 01:08:54,124
No one on earth has ever
known how to do that.

1316
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:56,093
She fixed me.

1317
01:08:56,126 --> 01:08:59,129
Charlotte's discovery
is a part of you now.

1318
01:09:01,098 --> 01:09:04,368
Your DNA could change the world.

1319
01:09:04,401 --> 01:09:06,702
And I have to know
how she did it,

1320
01:09:06,736 --> 01:09:09,073
but I just can't
replicate her work.

1321
01:09:09,106 --> 01:09:10,773
If I could just study you

1322
01:09:10,807 --> 01:09:14,178
and Beta, whose DNA
was never changed, I could...

1323
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:19,316
...fix a terrible mistake
that I've made.

1324
01:09:19,349 --> 01:09:21,651
