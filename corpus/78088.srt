1
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:20,646
<i>It's a beautiful morning, Chicago. And to</i>
<i>all you graduating Bulldogs, "Go get them!"</i>

2
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,331
Boys.

3
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,265
Hey.

4
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,139
Dude!

5
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,445
Dude.

6
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:03,946
How's it hanging, man?

7
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,852
Slightly to the left, bro.
Why? What's up?

8
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:10,989
Nothing. Just stopped by to check out
your decks. I thrashed mine.

9
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,820
- Check out my new "sponsor me" tape.
- Any different than the last three?

10
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:18,361
Totally. Remember that trick I was trying
on the vert? That flip trick?

11
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,398
This close to landing it.
I'll have it in a week.

12
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,734
- You're wasting your time.
- Thanks.

13
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,429
I'll tell you what.
If you land it, I'll sponsor you.

14
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:31,065
- All right.
- In the meantime, wanna buy something?

15
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,939
I wish I could, dude. I'm broke.

16
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:36,809
I'm broke. Just let me hang out.
I'm your best customer. I'm here every day.

17
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:41,646
But you never spend money. You gotta start
spending money. Money-spending is good.

18
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,882
Little man! I told you already.
Reach your hand in there with that T-shirt...

19
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:49,255
...you're pulling out a stump! Don't make
me go over and smack you!

20
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,919
Yo, Bam.

21
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,031
- What's up, man?
- Bro.

22
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,498
- I love you, bro.
- All right. Easy, Greg.

23
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,069
Freaking me out, man.
Let me get a skateboard.

24
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,141
- Which one do you want?
- I don't care. They're all the same shape.

25
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,300
I want my board, right there.
That one.

26
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:08,675
- Let me get all three of those.
- I can do that for you.

27
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,221
- Bam special. Bam!
- Bam.

28
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,584
- Hey, what's up?
- What's up, man?

29
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:23,388
Do you remember me? Probably not. We
skated SCRAP together a couple years ago.

30
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:26,964
- Oh, yeah. Dude, yeah. You were ripping.
- Thanks, bro.

31
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,862
- Keep an eye on this kid.
- Thanks.

32
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,765
Watch out for this guy's frontside 360.

33
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:35,732
- He's got the SSBSTS lurking.
- It's for the wall.

34
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:39,309
- You going to the demo later on?
- Hell, yeah. I wouldn't miss it.

35
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,414
- It's for the wall.
- You don't have to make excuses.

36
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:53,051
- Sorry.
- Bam was a loser before he got sponsored.

37
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,251
- Just like you, dude.
- Thanks.

38
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:58,192
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna make you a deal, Greg.

39
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,662
- You flow me one of these decks.
- For free?

40
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:04,997
Yeah, for free. Exactly.
And in exchange, I'll skate it.

41
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:08,470
I'll tell everybody where I got it.
You can sponsor me.

42
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,268
All right, dude.

43
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,170
Which one do you want?

44
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:13,807
For real?

45
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,306
All right.

46
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:20,143
How about we go with one
of those Elements, like Bam got?

47
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:24,915
Dude, for you, I can go that board $ 140.

48
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,690
Tax not included.

49
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,748
Nice hat.

50
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,891
We're late.

51
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,656
Let's go.

52
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,665
Shut up.

53
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:21,213
I still can't believe it. Bam just walks in and
Greg tosses him a handful of his decks.

54
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,778
- I can't wait to get my own deck.
- I did the math.

55
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:31,548
There's 53 guys who make a living skating
and about a million wannabes like us.

56
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,020
And?

57
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:36,787
And nothing. But until a sponsor backs
a tour bus into my driveway...

58
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,625
...I have to work all summer
to pay for school.

59
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,461
I don't believe you.
You're still gonna bail on me.

60
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:46,594
You know what? Matt listened to your crap,
and look where that got him.

61
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,673
The guy is a complete stain.

62
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,570
- Matt deceives you.
- I don't--

63
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:55,510
He does because he, in actuality,
really knows which end is up.

64
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,754
What's up, man?

65
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,197
So Dustin's bailing on us again.

66
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:19,327
Really? I'm gonna alert the press, man.
Dustin's always bailing.

67
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,075
I'll always skate.
I just won't be homeless with you.

68
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,609
You say that,
but I know you mean something else.

69
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:31,307
Before you know it, you'll be a fat,
middle-aged male with a nice beer gut...

70
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:35,112
...divorced about 20 times,
wishing you were skating again.

71
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,913
Dudes.

72
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,858
- Get the moron out of the pool.
- Matt.

73
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,726
When is the moron gonna
release his death grip on our premises?

74
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,298
Have you smelled it lately?
It's like an open sewer.

75
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,369
- Good to see you too, Pops.
- We need to talk about your future.

76
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:55,029
Yeah, you know, I'd love to,
but we're heading out to this...

77
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,569
- Sugarplum.
- I hate when he calls me that.

78
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,140
Listen, remember our deal.

79
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,148
- Dad, l--
- Don't "Dad" me. We had a deal.

80
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:10,288
You're either in school, or you're at Rivers
Hardware working next to your old man.

81
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:14,187
Sniffing a little of that lacquer
while you're mixing the paint. Come on!

82
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,693
Obvious perks there.
It's a good living. It's a good future.

83
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:21,123
It's a good life. I'll tell you that much.
Think about it.

84
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,359
Yeah. Let's go, honey.

85
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,567
Get in there, you little...

86
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,700
Dude, your stepmom is so hot.

87
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,144
See the way she was looking at me?

88
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,643
I was like...

89
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,560
- Hello?
- Good afternoon, Chili N Such.

90
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,392
- Can I scoop for you?
- <i>I'd like chili, Fire in the Hole...</i>

91
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,399
<i>... hotter than hell,</i>
<i>make it meat in the ass.</i>

92
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,001
Hey there.

93
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,401
Hi, I ordered a Tummy-Killer Ranchero...

94
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,702
...and I got a Double-Chunk Gut Bomb
with cheese by mistake.

95
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,845
- I'd like what I ordered.
- Sorry, sir.

96
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,875
- <i>Hello?</i>
- I didn't get that, sir. Could you--?

97
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,779
- <i>Could you repeat that?</i>
- Open your ears, jackass!

98
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:16,011
Yeah, I see that you already ate
the Gut Bomb, though.

99
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:20,955
Yeah, but I can't help it that I didn't
figure it out until I'd swallowed it all.

100
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:24,126
- You really think you need another?
- What?

101
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,924
Mr. Knight, let me handle this.

102
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:30,535
Sir, our policy clearly states every customer
will be served to his satisfaction.

103
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,968
Customer may receive a replacement--
Excuse me, I'll be right with you.

104
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,667
A replacement will be given as long
as he has a receipt. You have one?

105
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:41,244
All right, that's good.
Give him one of these. You're late, Eric.

106
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,211
You're just a little bit late.

107
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,612
And late is not great.

108
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,814
Do you wanna go to the restroom
before I reload you?

109
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:52,752
- You want me to call the grownup back?
- You're probably leaking beans.

110
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,656
One big scoop. That's two,
but two is enough. Two is plenty.

111
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,161
Now, let's go over here
and do the cheddar.

112
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:03,234
Two scoops of cheddar, one scoop
of onion. That's very good, son.

113
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:07,600
You know, Eric, you've got great potential.
Just go to it. You go to it, deputy.

114
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,638
Attaboy! Fire in the Hole!

115
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,633
One Fire in the Hole there.

116
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,075
No, sir, we don't have diet.

117
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:21,008
Two hours till the demo. Let's get
this place cleaned up and get out.

118
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,744
I can't. I need the overtime.

119
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:24,656
Oh, boy!

120
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:29,954
Boy! Someone really abused the men's
room. It's like a doody bomb exploded.

121
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,193
Was he a tall guy with glasses maybe?
Just a hunch.

122
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,525
- Think this is funny, Mr. Knight?
- No, I don't.

123
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:40,069
Show a little team spirit. Go in there
and make it sparkle. Here you go.

124
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,207
- It'll be my pleasure.
- Thank you, sir.

125
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,400
Hey, listen. Wear gloves, buddy.

126
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:49,310
Keep laughing, Eric, but I'm gonna be at
college in the fall, and you'll still be here.

127
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:53,779
And you, sir.
There's a birthday party at table 13.

128
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,918
Need you in the bean suit.

129
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,357
You're kidding me.
The bean suit again?

130
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,090
Bean suit right away.

131
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,088
Thank you, sir.

132
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,229
- Whose birthday is it?
- Ours.

133
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:13,428
I'm Sheriff Bean.

134
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:13,731
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands</i>
<i>together and scream...</i>

135
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,891
<i>... because it is on today, Chicago.</i>

136
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:21,472
<i>I don't know if you were praying last night,</i>
<i>but we got some great weather today.</i>

137
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,474
- I can't believe you quit.
- Shut up and pay attention.

138
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:29,310
This is insane. I've never seen anyone
do these lines at the park.

139
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,446
- Cold?
- <i>Jimmy Wilson!</i>

140
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,619
Give it up! That's right, Chicago.

141
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,088
Jimmy, over here!

142
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,728
Look at all those hot chicks lining up
to get a crack at him.

143
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:48,295
- There is no bruised fruit in that medley.
- No beasts.

144
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:52,667
You know what? It's more than that.
This guy is skating for a living.

145
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:18,687
- You guys wanna go check out the vert?
- Yeah.

146
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,938
Mommy!

147
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:31,104
Can you move, in case one
of those skaters looks over here?

148
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,440
- I'm a professional skater, baby.
- Yeah, right.

149
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:38,572
I'm telling you the truth. I'm not skating
today, because I thrashed my arm.

150
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:42,243
Here, smell this. You think it's more like
pepperoni or ass crack?

151
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,048
I got 5 bucks on pepperoni.

152
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,725
You're so gross, man.

153
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,652
You'll be back.

154
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,854
- Think he does his own laundry?
- Are you kidding me?

155
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:26,531
He gets sick of his shirt, he takes it off
and he gets a new one for free.

156
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,131
I want!

157
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,834
You need to earn your rank here.

158
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,837
Check it out.

159
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,239
Jimmy Wilson!

160
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,546
Yeah!

161
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,473
Can you imagine for five seconds
what it must be like to ride in that thing?

162
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,371
Hell, yeah.

163
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:14,034
Girls, money...

164
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,977
...signing autographs,
making the girls go--

165
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,276
Look at this. Look at this.

166
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:28,690
No way, man!

167
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,419
Pinch me.

168
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,529
Let's go.

169
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,564
Don't I know you from Chili N Such?

170
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,568
Breasts.

171
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:48,278
I like them two at a time and round.
Ladies!

172
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,777
I represent
the Release the Twins Foundation.

173
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,146
You guys wanna make a little donation?

174
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,880
- What are you talking about?
- About releasing those twins.

175
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,956
They look uncomfortable
in their little cages. Come out!

176
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,890
It's no wonder why you can't get a date.

177
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,259
It was working.

178
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:12,362
- I'm in a dry spell, man.
- To be in a dry spell...

179
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:15,871
...you've had to have been in a wet spell.
- I've had sex.

180
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,202
Yeah, with a human, though.

181
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,603
Who's making these rules, man?

182
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,346
Product toss.

183
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:36,554
I love it when these little freaks
tear each other's skin off for a sticker.

184
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,038
What is he doing?

185
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:59,847
I had to skin a 9-year-old
for that, man.

186
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:01,986
You needed a board.

187
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:03,849
It's yours.

188
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,652
Let's see if we can talk to Jimmy
before we jet.

189
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,829
Excuse me, sir,
we're here to see Jimmy.

190
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,797
- Oh, my freaking Lord!
- Oh, my God! Get it away.

191
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,029
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing, sir.

192
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:25,700
We are just here to see Jimmy. Is he in the
scar--? The car? The bus? That where he is?

193
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,779
- That's a big "no" on Jimmy.
- Good. Thank you.

194
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,245
- What are you looking at, pinhead?
- No.

195
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,311
What's up?

196
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:43,693
Actually, we're here to see Jimmy.
He told me to drop this tape by for him.

197
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,090
- I think he wants to sponsor us.
- That's cool.

198
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:50,429
- I'm stoked.
- That's great, guys. Hang on just a minute.

199
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:52,160
All right.

200
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,636
Let's see.

201
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,402
- Cool.
- There you go.

202
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,877
Yeah. This is just today's haul.

203
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:07,542
- Excuse me, that's all from today?
- Yeah.

204
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:12,315
- "Sponsor me." Two very popular words.
- How does he have time to watch all those?

205
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:16,392
Well, he's worked out this technique
where he doesn't watch any of them.

206
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,588
It's working out really well for him. Yeah.

207
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:28,597
- Should I bounce these nerds out of here?
- No, they're cool. You guys are cool, right?

208
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,469
- Yeah, we're straight.
- I'm cool.

209
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,076
- It's okay.
- All right.

210
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:39,273
So I'm here to help you.
I don't want you to get in trouble.

211
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:44,252
Because the truth is, Jimmy did want us
to come by and say what's up, you know?

212
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:47,324
And if you could just get us in
for two minutes...

213
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,959
- I can do that.
- You can do that.

214
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:54,395
But I'm not going to do that,
because I don't want to.

215
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:57,797
And I just can't seem to find my way
around that.

216
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:02,134
I'm sorry. I really wish you guys
all the best in the world, sincerely.

217
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:06,676
You know, but-- You know, hey.
Guys, just skate, you know?

218
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:09,939
And if you're really any good,
then someone will find you.

219
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:11,377
All right?

220
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,241
All right.

221
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,782
- Now would be a good time.
- Hey! Get out of here!

222
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,954
Nice kids. I like them.
Don't you like them?

223
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,253
I like them.

224
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:35,235
All right, so pack your shit.
We're going on tour.

225
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,568
- When do we leave?
- Did somebody see our tapes?

226
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:41,008
- Whose team are we on?
- Hold on. Hold on.

227
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,611
Live for your viewing pleasure.

228
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,815
We are Super Duper Skates.

229
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:52,514
Dear Lord, Eric!
I am never, ever going to wear that.

230
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:55,591
The whole thing sort of sounds sketchy.
I'm sorry.

231
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,661
I never heard of this Super Duper Skates.

232
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,826
Yeah, I know.
That's because I just made it up.

233
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,433
Wake up and smell the desperation.

234
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,065
We needed a company name
to give us credibility on tour.

235
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,333
- On tour?
- Right. We're hitting the road as a team.

236
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:14,070
- We skate better than half of those guys.
- Yeah, I can. It's weird.

237
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:18,182
There you go. Jimmy's a man, right? Once
we're on the road, we follow him around.

238
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,410
We get in front of him one time,
he'll see we're the real deal.

239
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,380
That does sound super-duper.

240
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,651
But I really don't-- I mean,
I'm just saying, if you think about it--

241
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:32,354
No, it's cool. It's cool. You two
can sit here and touch yourselves...

242
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:37,298
...for the rest of your lives, or you can try
getting off your asses and making it happen.

243
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,699
That's about a nine
on the Richter scale, man.

244
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:44,604
I think he's saying we got a nest egg
here, and we're extraordinarily comfortable.

245
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,881
Slug Bug!

246
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,078
Mr. Rivers!

247
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,385
Slug Bug!

248
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,116
Mr. Rivers.

249
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,187
Kids dig me.

250
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,154
- When's her lease up?
- Where's the money we're using...

251
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,265
...on this trip coming from?

252
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:17,536
- Stop looking at me.
- You can do this. You have no choice.

253
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,075
- I absolutely am not doing it. I can't.
- You can.

254
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:24,076
No. Don't even talk-- I'm not.
There's no way in hell I'm doing it.

255
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:25,811
What?

256
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:30,913
Now that the money issue is settled,
where are we gonna get some wheels?

257
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,023
We just got to find a van.

258
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,252
I got it!

259
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,808
That was my mom's.

260
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,140
This was actually my grandma's,
this little bellybutton ring.

261
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,475
- It's crazy.
- That's so sweet.

262
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,947
I like the way you guys smell.

263
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,683
- Sweet Lou.
- See you girls later.

264
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,515
- What's going on?
- What's up, fool?

265
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:07,351
- How are you guys doing?
- Doing good.

266
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,153
Matt Jensen.

267
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,657
- Good to see you guys.
- So, dude, listen, we're thinking...

268
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,061
...about joining the Jimmy Wilson Tour.
- Really?

269
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:19,294
Yeah. It's gonna be phat. We need a fourth
skater, so we were thinking about you.

270
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,570
Naturally, but...

271
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,235
Sweet Lou's got everything
he needs right here.

272
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:29,577
What? Okay. Dude, we're going
cross-country. You know what that means.

273
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,216
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you do.

274
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,614
No. What does that mean?

275
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:41,486
Dude, chicks in different area codes.
Uncharted territory.

276
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,959
<i>I got pros</i>
<i>I got pros</i>

277
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,030
You know what I'm saying?

278
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,963
It's tempting, but...

279
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,702
I don't know.

280
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,371
You know, school just let out and all.

281
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,633
Didn't you graduate six years ago?

282
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,635
Yeah.

283
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:01,438
But they didn't.

284
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,683
- Hi.
- Again, a good point.

285
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,978
Well...

286
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:13,254
Maybe it's none of my business
or anything...

287
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:16,451
...but don't you think maybe you should
move on? A little change?

288
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:21,031
It's just too easy, sitting here year after
year, watching the new crop roll in...

289
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,723
...and me just taking my pick.

290
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,967
Besides, my calendar
is already pretty booked.

291
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:28,332
You saw those two Betties
that were here before?

292
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,000
They're just my Tuesday.

293
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,803
You should see Friday.

294
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,609
Yeah, we should hang out.

295
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:39,217
You guys have fun on your little road trip,
but count me out.

296
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:43,180
All right, man, well I'm gonna miss you.

297
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:45,856
- Hey, Lou.
- Hey, Wednesday.

298
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,455
It's Sandy.

299
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:49,889
Right.

300
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,756
I've been trying you all day.

301
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,297
Sandy, chill.
I told you, I'd call you.

302
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,729
Wednesday.

303
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,699
Don't get so extended.

304
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,929
What's up, baby? Matt Jensen.

305
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:06,000
I'm okay with that and everything,
but my dad is crazed.

306
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,079
- You told your dad?
- Yeah. He says he's gonna kill you...

307
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:12,410
...and then dangle your balls
from his rear-view mirror.

308
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,811
Daddy!

309
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:26,063
- What's the first stop?
- Wait! You're in?

310
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:31,268
Daddy, don't hurt him! Please!

311
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,868
- Call me!
- Bye, Lou!

312
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,533
Call me on Wednesday, okay?

313
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,086
One more thing, dude.

314
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,505
Not bad.

315
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:18,681
Van Gogh.

316
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,814
- Let's roll.
- Cool.

317
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,884
Dustin was supposed to be here
a half-hour ago.

318
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,959
- What about my overtime?
- You don't need it.

319
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,695
- What about college?
- Consider this your full ride.

320
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,101
Then I need to go back
and get my special pillow.

321
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,935
Get inside!

322
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:47,403
Excuse me, Mr. Knight,
your shift is not over!

323
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,570
You have not punched out, Mr. Knight!

324
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,579
Mr. Knight!

325
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,147
Where are we going?

326
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:58,923
Jimmy Wilson's skating the Pro-Am contest
in Kansas. It's our first stop.

327
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:18,202
Damn, it smells like roses.

328
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,144
I done farted!

329
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:24,440
Why you always gotta base
in my face, fool?

330
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:25,878
Yo, yo, check it.

331
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:33,420
All right, Kansas,
are you ready to go big?

332
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:37,892
I knew you knew who I was!
You saw that front cover, baby.

333
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,792
Watch out, son.

334
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:43,090
Yo, I know you wannabes
are not here to skate!

335
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,202
What's up, white chocolate?

336
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:48,495
Don't be talking no head, fool.
Red Crip, tell them what's up.

337
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:52,609
- Yeah, I'm feeling to bust you in your grills.
- Yeah, in your grills, dog!

338
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,803
Our grills?
Is there some sort of barbecue later?

339
00:26:57,148 --> 00:27:00,015
The party is at Rolling Deuce tonight.
It should be pretty cool.

340
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:02,812
- Sounds cool.
- She's talking to Matt Ball, dude.

341
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:07,719
All right, no worries.
I got this under control.

342
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,595
- Hey, how are you?
- Good.

343
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,992
Eric Rivers,
with the Super Duper Skate team.

344
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:14,859
That's cute. Super Duper?

345
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,297
- That's great.
- Yeah, it's great.

346
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,394
Wait.

347
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:23,467
- You're not registered.
- I'm sure we're on there.

348
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,906
- We're sponsored, so...
- Okay.

349
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:30,870
I'm sorry. If you're not preregistered,
you can't skate this event. Next!

350
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:35,748
No, no. This is our first event as a team,
and we just drove all the way from Chicago.

351
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:40,186
And I basically kidnapped my best friend,
okay? And blew his only shot at college.

352
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:45,523
So if you could find some way to make
the list work, we'd be really thankful.

353
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:50,657
You know what? Tell your sob story
someplace else. We're all full up here.

354
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,462
Next.

355
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,565
Next!

356
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,071
Let me get in here.

357
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:01,975
I can't believe they've never heard of Super
Duper Skates. That's a freaking outrage.

358
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:05,580
All right, let's go skate the parking lot
and wait Jimmy out.

359
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,377
Don't be so harsh, mama.

360
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,143
Hook us up.

361
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,383
You know what?

362
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,418
Mama's already been hooked up.

363
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,726
Next.

364
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,693
Next.

365
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:22,195
Let's skate the lot.

366
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:29,038
Matt!

367
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:30,938
Matt!

368
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:16,950
- You all right?
- What happened?

369
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,587
- You all right, dude?
- What happened?

370
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:23,152
- I sprained my taint!
- Probably because you forgot to stretch.

371
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:26,957
- Listen, put some soda pop on it.
- Rub it clockwise, dude.

372
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,132
- What's that feel like?
- No, no, no, no.

373
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:34,264
You want a sip, man?

374
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,631
Can you roll off the ramp
so we can skate?

375
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:40,141
- Let me get it from behind.
- Where did my board go?

376
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,856
Ladies, nice balloons. Nice.

377
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:03,229
Come over here for a second. Don't be
like that. I got a little trick for you. Hey!

378
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,432
Girls, how are you tonight?

379
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:08,436
Do a little trick?
Who's your daddy? Who's your daddy?

380
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,534
All right. We got this.

381
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,206
Like we've done it a million times.

382
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,814
I stepped in dog poo.

383
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:20,242
All right, hold up.

384
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:27,751
- That burns! What's that for?
- Because you need it.

385
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,395
Look at this line.

386
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:55,642
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- I hate clowns.

387
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:59,583
Oh, I'm sure they'll let four guys in.

388
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,103
Check this out.

389
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,968
What's up?

390
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:22,472
Watch out, son.

391
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,515
Yo, muscles, check it, okay?

392
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,121
Check the list, girl.

393
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,314
Don't be scared.

394
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:38,120
Come on, now, you know who we are.
Don't you know who we are? Come on!

395
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,662
You know who we are, right?

396
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,527
- What up, girls?
- Word up.

397
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,691
Thank you very much, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

398
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:47,804
<i>All up in my business</i>
<i>All up in my business</i>

399
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:50,304
Break out the Cristal, fool!

400
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:53,035
We up in here!

401
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,811
Eric, you're the shizit.

402
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:03,286
Check it out. It's Brian Patch.

403
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,927
Hey, Bam!

404
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:30,908
Bob Burnquist!

405
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:34,381
What's up, man? Matt Jensen.

406
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,385
Maybe she'll clean the van, dude!

407
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:00,037
Come to papa.

408
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:02,970
Guys, come on, stay focused, all right?

409
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:07,550
Fan out, take advantage
of any opportunities, look for pros.

410
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,591
Oh, I'm sorry.

411
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,254
Brian Sumner!

412
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,866
What's up? How are you doing?

413
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,534
That's crazy.

414
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,144
So, what is your name?

415
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,044
What is it?

416
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:45,988
What's going on, baby?

417
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:47,920
What's up? You're cute.

418
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:49,719
- Yeah.
- Are you a pro skater?

419
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:52,556
I drove down from Springfield
to meet a pro skater.

420
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,255
- So did I.
- You're from Springfield?

421
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:58,925
No, I came here to meet
some skaters, man!

422
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:02,099
Why do I always end up talking
to the gay guy?

423
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,435
What?

424
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:06,165
No!

425
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,946
I can't even hear what you said.
What did you say?

426
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:13,209
I can hear you fine.

427
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,886
I'm just not listening.

428
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,715
Okay.

429
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:22,359
Let me just get you
another glass of bitch.

430
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:25,618
Let's go. Okay.

431
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:29,560
You're drunk.

432
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,502
Ladies.

433
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:44,007
What's up?

434
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,441
Not much.

435
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,324
You wanna make out?

436
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:56,323
Yeah.

437
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,429
Stacy, come here.

438
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:15,012
What's going on, man?
How's it going?

439
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:18,671
It's so cool that I saw you here
because I'm trying to get sponsored...

440
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,341
...and I was wondering--
- It's not a good time.

441
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:26,615
I know. Seriously, right? I can't get anyone
to check my tape out. It's, like, impossible.

442
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:29,860
- So how did you get started?
- I'm working on something here.

443
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:33,553
Since this is a party,
you could go work on some for yourself.

444
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,395
Right.

445
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:40,230
Right on. All right, no worries.

446
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:28,847
- I'm all out. You want another drink?
- Sure.

447
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:30,680
Okay.

448
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:35,721
- Hey.
- What's going on?

449
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:38,885
It's our song, dude! Come on!

450
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:42,789
Come on, bitch.

451
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,231
You too. Move.

452
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:49,137
- You're doing it. Yeah.
- I don't know.

453
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,904
I don't wanna do it.
I don't like this song.

454
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:53,634
I don't wanna.

455
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:56,473
You know what? Shut up.

456
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:06,984
All right, come on.

457
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:08,242
Come on.

458
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,283
I'm going.

459
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,748
Come on.

460
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,824
Trouble in the house!

461
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:22,464
Well, at least we got to hang
at the party.

462
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,124
Hell, yeah, man.

463
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,668
Dude, where's Sweet Lou?

464
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,649
What are you doing?

465
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:50,451
Why--?

466
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,255
Why would you do--? Get off me!

467
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,523
- This is vacation!
- Get off me! Get off!

468
00:38:54,699 --> 00:39:00,660
Why would you do that? I'm gonna vomit!
Do it again, and I'll castrate you like salami.

469
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,806
What are you gonna do?

470
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:05,032
- What are you gonna do?
- I swear to God!

471
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:08,838
Why would you throw out my book?
Because you can't read? It makes you mad?

472
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,004
Try it again! Try it again!

473
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,244
What now? What now?

474
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,351
Guys, look, it's those whigga dicks!

475
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:19,788
Nice bunny nostril!

476
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:22,892
- What? What?
- What, dog?

477
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,721
What are you doing here?

478
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:28,964
- Look out!
- Damn!

479
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,265
Fire!

480
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:34,063
- Get me something!
- What now?

481
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,938
Fire in the hole!

482
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,079
Put that away. What you gonna do?

483
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,680
Taste our pain, bitches!

484
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,284
Yeah, bomb them with it, dog!

485
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,215
Yeah!

486
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,287
Peace out!

487
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,795
It's got a pool.

488
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:29,486
And you boys said that we
wouldn't have any fun.

489
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,652
I'm catching hepatitis
just looking at it.

490
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,062
Oh, my little friend.

491
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,499
There's a lot of good meat on you.

492
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:51,075
I don't care how skinny you get.
I am still gonna eat you.

493
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:53,079
Excuse me.

494
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:57,345
Well, hello!

495
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,392
So how much for a room?

496
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:09,227
Well, it's $ 10 an hour,
and 40 for the whole night.

497
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,063
I guess that depends what you playboys
got in mind, huh?

498
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:14,932
Yeah, yeah.

499
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:21,006
You're crazy.

500
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:24,211
All right. You know what?

501
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:27,748
We'll clean your pool
if you let us crash here tonight.

502
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:31,388
Oh, yeah, my skimmer's been broken.

503
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:35,787
All right. You do the deed,
and Room 126 is yours.

504
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,520
And that, my friend,
is the honeymoon suite.

505
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,854
Pop the hood, man.

506
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,952
This is the honeymoon suite. Just--

507
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:24,694
There's only one bed,
and there's four guys.

508
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:33,807
I got it! I got it!

509
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:36,539
This is my side!

510
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,041
Get off me!

511
00:43:39,383 --> 00:43:41,374
Manties!

512
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:46,989
What the--? What?

513
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:50,058
You did not just find these in that bed.

514
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:57,363
Yo, D.

515
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,863
You still pissed at me?

516
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:08,136
No, man, forget about it.

517
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,640
Good times.

518
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:18,981
You really think we have a chance?

519
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:24,358
I don't know, dude.
This is what I want in life.

520
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:26,928
This is what I was meant to do.

521
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:30,830
If we focus...

522
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:34,698
...there's no reason
why we don't have a chance.

523
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:42,741
Greetings from the interior.

524
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:48,450
- Matt!
- I think I can taste that one.

525
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:54,724
Matt!

526
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:56,556
That wasn't me.

527
00:44:56,727 --> 00:45:01,630
Sorry. That was me.
Can I have my underwear back?

528
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:38,162
Slug Bug!

529
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,000
- Butt slap.
- I was playing by the rules.

530
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:48,110
- God!
- I am so sick of this butt rock music, man.

531
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:51,941
- Don't change it.
- No! I need some beats, dude.

532
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:54,717
I'll snap your neck like a glowstick!

533
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,288
Nice tits. Can I squeeze them?

534
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:08,161
What the hell is this?

535
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:10,766
Are you serious?

536
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:14,432
Just listen and learn, boys.

537
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:25,867
So glad to be skating this summer, boys,
instead of McJobbing it.

538
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:28,568
Two scoops cheddar, one scoop onion,
my friend.

539
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:31,270
- Sweet Lou needs fuel.
- Right on.

540
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:33,348
What do you say, Dust?
Spot us some cash.

541
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:36,611
Listen, I already put out for gas
and put out for food...

542
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,447
...and I put out for porn.

543
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,088
You're so stingy, you punk.

544
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:42,225
Damn it! Why?

545
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:45,919
- I didn't even know I was going!
- It's so-- I just got peed on.

546
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:49,862
All right, all right, all right.
I got a plan.

547
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:53,161
They got one of these in Colorado?

548
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:54,968
I hate Chili N Such.

549
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:57,402
All right, bro, you know the drill.

550
00:47:57,908 --> 00:47:59,933
Oh, yes, I do.

551
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,102
Wait, what are we doing?

552
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:03,907
We don't have any cash.

553
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:05,878
Chili, chili, chili, chili.

554
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,358
What are you doing?

555
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:18,291
I dropped something,
and I'm looking for it.

556
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:21,090
I had curly cheese fries,
lots of them, and a shake.

557
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:25,133
Okay. Didn't your mom ever tell you
not to talk to strangers?

558
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:30,267
I guess she didn't say anything about
puking on them, though. Thank you.

559
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:33,168
Chili, chili, chili, chili...

560
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:50,855
- Hello?
- <i>Welcome to Chili N Such.</i>

561
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:52,859
- <i>Can I scoop for you?</i>
- So listen...

562
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:56,363
...I was actually by here
about an hour ago.

563
00:48:56,533 --> 00:49:02,403
And we ordered 10 Gut Bomb
Chili Surprises and five shakes.

564
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:06,736
It's funny because when I got home,
there were actually only coffees...

565
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,470
- Chili.
...in the bag.

566
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:13,343
<i>I remember that order. Drive through,</i>
<i>and we'll replace it.</i>

567
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,696
"Animal Chin Skate Shop.

568
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:31,027
Internationally renowned skateboarder
Jimmy Wilson...

569
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:34,693
...discovered here, 1992."

570
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:38,705
Yeah, but where is Jimmy's bus?
Shouldn't there be a big crowd here?

571
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,309
I don't know, bro. Maybe we're early.

572
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,810
Let's go scope it out.

573
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:47,377
- What's up, yo?
- "What's up, yo?"

574
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:50,511
How's it going there?

575
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:53,053
- Jimmy Wilson?
- Jimmy Wilson. The demo.

576
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:54,918
Check this cut.

577
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,362
Excuse me!

578
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:07,696
We're here for Jimmy's demo.
Jimmy Wilson.

579
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:09,736
Do you know Jimmy?

580
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:11,567
Jimmy was gnarly.

581
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:13,607
Jimmy was...

582
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:17,008
Jimmy was Jimmy. Jimmy was...

583
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,373
...off the hook.

584
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,542
Off the hook.

585
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:23,583
You know?

586
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:24,754
Jimmy was...

587
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:26,547
Jimmy was:

588
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:34,086
- I'm sorry, did you say, "was"?
- Did you guys see--?

589
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:36,164
Today is...

590
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:41,067
Today is Saturday. Today is Sunday.
The demo was yesterday.

591
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:43,001
- Goddamn it.
- It happened already?

592
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:47,507
Did you guys see--?
Jimmy was, like:

593
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:55,310
Yeah, Saturday, man. Saturday.
Demo was Saturday.

594
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:59,785
- Today is Sunday. So Saturday plus a day...
- You said that.

595
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:02,424
...is Sunday.
- It happened already!

596
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:04,753
It already happened.

597
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:06,725
I think you guys missed a day.

598
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:07,921
We lost a day.

599
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:11,727
Jimmy was something. He was--
He was old school.

600
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:14,669
You know what I'm saying? He was like:

601
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:19,507
That was Jimmy right there.

602
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:26,344
All right, well, what do we do?
I mean, since we're already here...

603
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:29,508
...there's not much we can do now.

604
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,279
So at least we can skate the lot.

605
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,457
You guys know Jimmy?

606
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:38,992
No. Is it cool if we just--?

607
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:41,062
Jimmy was gnarly, bro.

608
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:43,062
He was awesome, dudes.

609
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:46,396
Do you mind if we at least set
some cones up out there?

610
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:48,128
Do a little demo of our own?

611
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:50,833
You wanna skate the park?

612
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:21,829
What's up?

613
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:23,905
You.

614
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:27,668
Nice.

615
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:34,179
Dude, you're pretty badass.

616
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:36,819
- Thanks, man.
- But I could totally take you.

617
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,454
Dude, what grade are you in?

618
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:41,386
Seventh. I'm 12, bitch.

619
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:44,056
And you got something to teach me?

620
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:47,788
All right, how about you talk to me
when you're out of diapers.

621
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:10,045
That kid is totally taking you.
What is he in, seventh grade?

622
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:12,181
I wonder if he's got a sister.

623
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:15,924
You wanna make out?

624
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:20,120
Yeah, sure.

625
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:31,969
- Where's the product toss?
- Where's the free stuff?

626
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:35,805
If you losers are really sponsored,
where's the free stuff?

627
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:46,019
What do you say you and me lose
this dead weight and hit the strip clubs?

628
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:50,119
I like your style, kid. Keep it up.

629
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:55,657
- Where's the stuff?
- Lil' Bow Wow, keep barking...

630
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:58,699
...and it's a one-way walk in the woods.
- You got jokes?

631
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:02,031
- I don't got jokes, I got threats.
- Man, give me your skateboard.

632
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:07,136
Man, give me a T-shirt!
Man, give me your shoes! Give me--

633
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:12,340
- In your face!
- Your team sucks!

634
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:15,507
Our team doesn't suck!
What is wrong with their eyes?

635
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:18,586
In the van! In the van! Product toss.
Look at that, free hat.

636
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:21,051
Shirt!

637
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:23,318
Let's get out of here!

638
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:25,891
Ride my fingerboard, bitches!

639
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:46,811
All right.

640
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:50,314
Yeah, you got good hands.

641
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:52,321
Can you go deeper?

642
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:54,649
Oh, yeah, that's deep.

643
00:54:56,893 --> 00:54:59,259
This is fantastic.

644
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:01,522
What about doing my glutes next?

645
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:02,960
With what, my face?

646
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,310
Shit.

647
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:31,227
Put some elbow into it, man.

648
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:34,022
I'll put some elbow into your face.

649
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:39,900
How we gonna get Jimmy Wilson to see us
if we can't even skate a contest?

650
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,334
How we gonna get girls to see us?

651
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:45,167
Have you been in a coma this entire time?

652
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,105
They're everywhere.

653
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:50,178
Sweet Lou is all over
this little pro chick right now.

654
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,872
Why does that bother you so much?

655
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,179
Because it's not happening to me.

656
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:59,515
If you would change your clothes,
even one time, there might-- I don't know.

657
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,826
What's wrong with you?

658
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,722
My college fund is gutted.

659
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,765
Well, that's what separates the men
from the boys.

660
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,692
Maybe I can get my job back.

661
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,202
You know what, Sweet Lou?

662
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,773
I got a rule, man.

663
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:22,036
No more of these freaky, spazzy chicks...

664
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,373
...coming across state lines
with us, man.

665
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:27,277
That's what's bringing
this team vibe down!

666
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:32,114
It's my van. It's my rules.

667
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:34,947
And I like her.

668
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:42,091
At least there's no way in hell
that this could get any worse.

669
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,936
In the name of all things holy.
Are you kidding me, man?

670
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:52,165
I'm sorry. Are you upset with the fact
that I've worked hard and saved money?

671
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:56,108
And with that money, I happened
to buy a little food for myself?

672
00:56:58,615 --> 00:56:59,639
It's bread.

673
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,318
No!

674
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:06,955
I said, no girls!

675
00:57:08,691 --> 00:57:10,659
No! God, stop!

676
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,922
Damn it!

677
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:32,440
At least she left our stuff.

678
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:36,182
Touché.

679
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:47,992
We're gonna die out here.
We have no food and no car.

680
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:50,496
Seriously, anyone,
what are we gonna do?

681
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:52,498
I thought she was a sweet girl.

682
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:56,264
That's her ass you're thinking about,
not her depraved criminal mind.

683
00:57:56,439 --> 00:57:59,567
Wham, bam, steal the van.

684
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:03,606
We just need something. Some kind
of sign to tell us to keep going.

685
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,010
Do we? I'm sure we're gonna get a sign.

686
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:10,141
Look, Jimmy Wilson is coming over the hill
right now to give us a big deal.

687
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,949
There he is. Look, there's his bus,
and he's got a scholarship for me.

688
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:17,593
Oh, no, wait. That's a mirage because
we're in the middle of the desert!

689
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,835
- Tucson, that's where we're headed?
- Yeah.

690
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,807
That's good.

691
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,777
No one's food here!

692
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,588
I just had the wildest dream, man.

693
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:22,190
What are you doing?

694
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,693
Save me!

695
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,163
Look! It's a lizard!

696
00:59:32,335 --> 00:59:35,964
I just got violated by a lizard, man.

697
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:46,915
Actually, that felt kind of good.

698
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:57,490
- Somebody's coming.
- All right, you guys hang back. All right?

699
00:59:57,694 --> 00:59:59,423
And hide Matt.

700
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:01,597
Come here, buddy.

701
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:05,256
- Did you just say, "buddy"?
- Shut up.

702
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:23,515
Nice ass!

703
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:30,853
Hey.

704
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:34,291
I'm on my way to Tucson. Climb in.

705
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:50,937
What's up?

706
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:53,605
Hi. How are you?

707
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:55,774
Real good.

708
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:58,280
Sweet Lou!

709
01:00:58,454 --> 01:01:00,445
Nice catch, man.

710
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:05,092
All right, I'll check you guys later.

711
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:54,837
- That ain't gonna happen.
- What?

712
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:59,004
Come on. Do you work out?
Can we sit down and talk about it?

713
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:00,547
- Bam! Bam!
- What's up?

714
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,685
What's going on? Remember me from...?

715
01:02:02,852 --> 01:02:04,945
- The skate shop, right?
- Skate shop. Exactly.

716
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:07,555
- He's with me.
- I'm with him.

717
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,291
So how's everything going?

718
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:12,154
Yeah, really good.

719
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:16,057
So this is crazy, huh?

720
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:17,664
Yeah, it is pretty insane.

721
01:02:18,634 --> 01:02:22,468
I know your schedule and everything
like that has gotta be pretty nuts...

722
01:02:22,638 --> 01:02:25,630
...but if you have five minutes,
could you just check this out?

723
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:28,641
It's a tape we put together.
Could you pass it on to Jimmy?

724
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:32,073
I got so much shit on my plate,
the last thing I need now...

725
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,944
...is looking at some random
"sponsor me" tape.

726
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:38,482
- Sorry about that.
- That's cool. I figured I'd give it a shot.

727
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:42,385
Give me the tape. Of course I'll watch it.
I'm not that big of a dick.

728
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:45,559
- Thanks. That's great.
- Cool.

729
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:48,359
You talking shit about me?

730
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:50,791
Jamie, do you really wanna
do this now?

731
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,025
Have the balls to say it to my face.

732
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:56,428
Okay, I'm saying it to your face.
I don't want you here.

733
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:59,040
Okay? The last thing
I need on this tour...

734
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:02,837
...is some haggard-ass
chick lurking around.

735
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:06,042
Just take it easy, man.

736
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:08,581
What? You serious?

737
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:12,983
Yeah, relax. I mean, she doesn't
need you insulting her.

738
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:19,056
If you wanted me to watch your tape,
you pretty much ruined that. So...

739
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,729
Thanks.

740
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:31,101
Hey, so, that was pretty harsh, huh?

741
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:33,970
I think I can take care of myself.

742
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:38,346
No, I figured that.
I mean, I can tell, but...

743
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:42,342
You know, everybody could use
a little backup once in a while.

744
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:50,458
Wanna get out of here?

745
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:54,958
You serious?

746
01:04:02,471 --> 01:04:04,632
I don't think anybody is home.

747
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:07,432
Let's just get in
and out real fast, okay?

748
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:10,136
Hello?

749
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:14,739
- Anybody home?
- Hey, Matt, don't touch anything, okay?

750
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:17,551
Mirrored ceilings.

751
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:20,085
We got this place to ourselves, man.

752
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:23,157
Oh, black leather.
That's just how Snoop would do it.

753
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:26,953
- Oh, come on.
- Good.

754
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:29,287
Hey, ladies...

755
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:34,631
...I'm Jimmy Wilson.
Tonight you're gonna be my love slaves.

756
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:38,564
There it is.

757
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:43,344
Stop it for five seconds. All right, Jimbo,
just gonna bust a little switcheroo.

758
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:46,242
You hit play, you're gonna enjoy
the Super Duper team demo.

759
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:49,350
I've been holding it for two days.
It's about to go downtown.

760
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:53,386
Good idea. Take a crap on his bus.
He would appreciate that.

761
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,303
I got it. Let's go.

762
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:18,806
All right, dude, let's go.
I did it. Let's go.

763
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:23,217
Dude.

764
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:29,780
I might not get a piece of Jimmy Wilson,
but he got a piece of me.

765
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:32,186
That smells like hermit craps.

766
01:05:33,896 --> 01:05:35,022
That was amazing, Jimmy!

767
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,665
I've been waiting two years
to pull that trick.

768
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:40,563
- We got it on footage, check it out.
- Let's see it.

769
01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:44,502
Oh, no. What the hell?

770
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:47,370
Tell me that's not
your only copy of the tape.

771
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,211
Somebody broke the tour rule.

772
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:56,544
I'll fix this. Let's get out of here.

773
01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:00,917
Who did number two on the bus, man?
How many times do I have to tell them?

774
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:04,721
No going number two on my bus!

775
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:09,654
So basically...

776
01:06:09,865 --> 01:06:14,029
...we've been following the Jimmy Wilson
Tour all over the country.

777
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:15,329
That's insane.

778
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:18,837
Yeah. It sucks.
I had this whole thing planned out.

779
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:22,272
All we had to do, get in front of him,
and it was so easy.

780
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:25,471
He just had to see us skate,
and he'd pick us up.

781
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:27,179
But...

782
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:31,309
...of course, we found a way
to screw everything up...

783
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:34,522
...and the whole thing
has turned into a disaster.

784
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:37,682
You can't argue with talent. So...

785
01:06:37,893 --> 01:06:42,626
...just keep skating,
and someone will find you.

786
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:45,726
- I know about these things.
- You must.

787
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:54,075
I guess, by the way things went down,
you guys have been hooking up for a while.

788
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:58,447
You think I'm into Bam
because he's on tour?

789
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:02,473
I don't know. I thought that's
how things went around here.

790
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:05,916
Everyone hung out with the pros
and did their thing.

791
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:09,854
- Tour slut at your service.
- No!

792
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:13,791
I didn't-- I really didn't
mean it like that. I...

793
01:07:15,631 --> 01:07:19,294
It's just, you know, you're super cute.

794
01:07:19,902 --> 01:07:24,236
I'd throw myself under
the wheels of Jimmy's bus...

795
01:07:24,407 --> 01:07:26,932
...to get a chance to be
with a girl like you.

796
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:30,044
You're sick! You're sick!
That's sick!

797
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:36,280
I know you.

798
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:39,649
We got on Jimmy Wilson's bus,
and Matt took a big crap on it.

799
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:43,451
I don't know if it was the stroganoff
or what, but I was like--

800
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:44,750
Stop. Wonderful.

801
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:49,329
These are my friends by default and not
by choice, and we're leaving right now.

802
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:51,532
All right. See you.

803
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:55,162
- Bye, friends.
- Sometimes Eric looks like He-Man.

804
01:07:57,606 --> 01:07:59,471
So, what's up?

805
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:02,542
Let's go.

806
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:08,115
Excuse me, sorry.

807
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:10,976
I got a code brown to
wrestle down to the ground.

808
01:08:11,687 --> 01:08:12,949
Oh, my God!

809
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,053
There she is, boys.

810
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:22,957
What do we do now, man?

811
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:25,030
I don't know, dude.

812
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,595
Look at this guy.
Is this guy gonna stop?

813
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:33,766
Shit!

814
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,274
God, jackass!

815
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,015
Man, those things are awesome.

816
01:08:46,188 --> 01:08:49,180
He's not playing piano anytime soon, man.

817
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:01,336
Guys, come on. Come on, come on!

818
01:09:12,515 --> 01:09:14,415
Go, go, go, go, go!

819
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:20,814
Come on!

820
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:23,656
Kick the thing! Come on!

821
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:07,396
Hey, you all right?

822
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:11,539
- They didn't see it.
- But I sure did.

823
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:17,671
I'm sick and tired of you punks thinking you
can skate wherever the hell you feel like.

824
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:20,805
Sir, we're at a skate demo.

825
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:27,050
Smart-ass.

826
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:30,653
You know, I could have
you guys arrested.

827
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:34,362
Come here.

828
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:40,435
But for once, I'm gonna have you skaters
take care of your own mess.

829
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:46,305
Sweet Lou cleans no man's poop.

830
01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:48,874
Have fun, girls.

831
01:10:57,553 --> 01:10:58,850
So to recap...

832
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:02,782
...we smell like turds, we have no car,
no Jimmy Wilson...

833
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:05,690
...and I'm broke. Call me stupid.

834
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:07,225
- Hey, stupid.
- What?

835
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:08,828
Don't worry about it, man.

836
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:11,967
This is the part where
Eric Rivers jumps up...

837
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:16,332
...and angels descend from heaven,
sustaining one long note...

838
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:20,036
...and he says, "Team meeting."
- Does he have a plan? I bet he does.

839
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:23,276
He has a plan, so we all run
over there, and he goes:

840
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:24,912
"This is our last shot."

841
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:33,085
It's over.

842
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:41,625
What? Wait, he's giving up?

843
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:45,928
What the hell else you want me to do?

844
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:50,699
I'm fricking one step away
from being somebody's stalker.

845
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:55,871
You guys should have just stayed home,
not listened to a word I said.

846
01:11:56,111 --> 01:11:57,305
My fault.

847
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:03,642
Let's get one thing straight here.
I followed you here because you got balls.

848
01:12:05,554 --> 01:12:08,785
And because Sandy's dad
was about to rip mine off, but...

849
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:11,653
Seriously. If it wasn't for you,
we'd still be at home.

850
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:14,090
- I'd still be on your couch.
- Don't push me!

851
01:12:14,363 --> 01:12:18,299
Hey, man, I'm trying to tell you
we're having fun, bro.

852
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:22,237
For real, man. We're on an adventure.

853
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:28,232
No. No, we're on a train wreck.
This is a revolving nightmare.

854
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:30,810
No, a revolving nightmare
is us still in Chicago...

855
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:33,470
...not trying to do anything
with our lives.

856
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:39,246
Let me tell you something. The $ 736.18
I've spent since I've been here...

857
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:41,048
...worth it.

858
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:45,454
- You have that down to an exact--?
- Yes, worth it. Every penny.

859
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:47,926
Look at us, man.

860
01:12:48,163 --> 01:12:50,631
We're not losers anymore, man.
We're a team.

861
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,900
We're Super Duper.

862
01:12:57,706 --> 01:12:59,674
Fucking assholes.

863
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:01,871
Come on, don't be sad.

864
01:13:04,947 --> 01:13:06,710
- Hey!
- Hey, what's going on?

865
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:10,648
You might want to stand
back about 40 feet.

866
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:13,919
Yeah, look, I'm a little ripe right now.

867
01:13:14,089 --> 01:13:17,354
So listen, are you guys going
up to Santa Monica?

868
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:19,891
No, we weren't going to.
What's going on there?

869
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:22,962
It's the Pro Jam. If you're pro
or sponsored, you can skate.

870
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:24,790
Really?

871
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,669
I could try to help you guys out.

872
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:31,539
Maybe go with you?

873
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:34,107
All right. That would be great.

874
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:37,110
Come here, team meeting. Excuse us.

875
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:39,580
What's up?

876
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:43,146
Give me five seconds. What?

877
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:48,187
In the name of all things holy, please.
You feel this vibe? You feel the pulse?

878
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:51,724
How we're all sharing one heartbeat,
like a herd of elk?

879
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:57,456
We finally accumulated something
of a team vibe over there. Do not ruin it.

880
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:00,133
You don't wanna bring a girl?

881
01:14:00,335 --> 01:14:03,793
No, man! Where's the van, dude?
They're all cute, and...

882
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:06,440
...the horns come out. No!
Rules are rules.

883
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:09,702
But where's the van? Where's our car?
Maybe she has a car.

884
01:14:09,878 --> 01:14:11,846
She's a good girl. Trust her.

885
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:15,211
- She's sexy.
- Guys. I'm right here. I can hear you.

886
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:16,809
Hi.

887
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:20,887
It's cool. I mean, whatever.
Just do your thing.

888
01:14:21,056 --> 01:14:24,651
Seriously, I don't want to interrupt
your team vibe.

889
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:27,226
But you're not. That's the thing.

890
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:31,059
No, I get it. I totally-- I get it.
It's no big deal.

891
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:33,201
I hope I see you guys at the beach.

892
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:35,225
See you.

893
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:37,235
Jamie, it's nothing personal.

894
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:39,938
- It's just rules.
- You are such a dumb-ass.

895
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:44,612
I'm so hungry, one of my ribs
is poking through the skin.

896
01:14:44,913 --> 01:14:48,280
I would literally kill
for a night in a real bed.

897
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:57,151
Look who's got a nice, comfy SUV?

898
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:59,691
A nice "suv."

899
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:02,492
What do we do now, Matt?

900
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:06,633
It's time to meet the clowns, man.

901
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:18,603
Guys, what are we doing
in a clown college?

902
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:32,891
Matty!

903
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:41,631
- Hey, Mom.
- We missed the hell out of you!

904
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:44,695
Those are Matt's parents?

905
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:47,238
They really are clowns.

906
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:49,910
You reek!

907
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:52,279
Hey, Dad.

908
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:55,940
Matt?

909
01:15:56,451 --> 01:15:59,352
- What's up?
- You smell funky.

910
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:03,423
Wait, don't tell me. Give me a second.
I'm really good at this.

911
01:16:03,592 --> 01:16:04,889
I'm covered in shit.

912
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:09,726
Now, why the sudden visit?

913
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:12,593
Why haven't you called?

914
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:16,431
I don't know.
I guess I'm still kind of bitter...

915
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:19,768
...from when you guys abandoned me
my senior year in high school...

916
01:16:19,942 --> 01:16:22,137
...and ran off to join a circus.

917
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:24,108
I see.

918
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:33,312
- I'm sorry.
- No, we're sorry, son.

919
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:38,451
We're sorry we tried to push
you through clown college.

920
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:41,026
Sorry about a lot of other things.

921
01:16:41,196 --> 01:16:45,360
There's more to life than a pie
in the face for you, and we accept that.

922
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:53,840
I've been so pissed off at you for running
off and getting into this whole clown thing.

923
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:58,043
But I think I get it now.

924
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:02,077
You guys are just trying
to make yourselves happy.

925
01:17:03,418 --> 01:17:07,616
There are things in life
that just aren't that easy.

926
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:11,281
But the important thing is,
you're out there trying.

927
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:13,484
You're a man now.

928
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:16,061
We're proud of you.

929
01:17:16,498 --> 01:17:18,466
I love you, Dad.

930
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:21,493
I got him!

931
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:28,736
What's up?

932
01:17:31,013 --> 01:17:32,571
Bang.

933
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:38,411
I can't believe you're Matt's sister.

934
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:41,484
Me either.

935
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:45,285
So you want to...?

936
01:17:49,364 --> 01:17:51,298
"You want to...?"

937
01:17:56,371 --> 01:18:00,307
Do you wanna learn how to throw a pie?

938
01:18:02,644 --> 01:18:05,442
Bet you never turn down pie.

939
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:42,083
Oh, no.

940
01:18:45,787 --> 01:18:47,414
Nice.

941
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:50,490
Matt, you look different.

942
01:18:50,692 --> 01:18:54,788
Looking good, stud. I see you've taken
a lesson from the Sweet Lou.

943
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:57,555
Thought I'd clean up a little bit.

944
01:18:57,766 --> 01:19:02,169
Welcome to the human race, my friend.
I think you'll like it here.

945
01:19:07,943 --> 01:19:12,039
Thank you, guys,
for letting us crash here...

946
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:14,478
...and eat your food...

947
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:17,709
...and the clothes
and letting us take a shower.

948
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,081
And thanks for the truck.

949
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:23,291
We're always here for you, son.

950
01:19:25,827 --> 01:19:28,125
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you too, son.

951
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:33,163
- Okay.
- I love you, Mom.

952
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:40,908
Matt!

953
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:56,980
Mom.

954
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:01,627
I'm not gonna be needing these.

955
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:05,128
You can't blame a mom for trying.

956
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:29,055
Bye!

957
01:21:30,285 --> 01:21:31,980
Great.

958
01:21:32,988 --> 01:21:34,819
Yo, check it out.

959
01:21:36,258 --> 01:21:38,158
- Oh, no you didn't.
- Hell, no.

960
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:41,329
Get out of my business
before we bust a cap in your ass, fool.

961
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:44,498
Yo, this is a professional
skateboarding event, dog.

962
01:21:44,866 --> 01:21:47,835
- It don't include you.
- You wanna step, bee-yatch?

963
01:21:48,303 --> 01:21:50,032
Let me tell you how we do it.

964
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:58,240
- Keep it rolling, crackers.
- Keep going.

965
01:21:58,413 --> 01:22:00,677
- Super Duper bitches!
- Keep walking!

966
01:22:26,641 --> 01:22:28,404
- All right, get me a kid.
- Okay.

967
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:32,237
- Wait, what?
- Just get me a kid.

968
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:40,886
Hey. Eric Rivers.

969
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:46,489
Yeah, and this is little Timmy
from Create-A-Wish Foundation.

970
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:50,526
He wants to see us skate
before his head explodes.

971
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:53,259
I'm not a little kid!

972
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:59,463
Come on, guys. You know you can't
skate unless you're preregistered.

973
01:22:59,841 --> 01:23:01,138
Which...

974
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:03,302
...you are.

975
01:23:06,014 --> 01:23:07,504
Here you go.

976
01:23:08,516 --> 01:23:10,040
It worked?

977
01:23:43,218 --> 01:23:44,480
Dude, that's her!

978
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:36,869
You go, girl!

979
01:24:39,007 --> 01:24:40,133
She's bad!

980
01:24:40,308 --> 01:24:43,709
<i>Let's hear it for the Dream Team!</i>
<i>Give it up!</i>

981
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:55,821
So I put you and your friends on the list.

982
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:57,890
Figured if you could get out here...

983
01:24:58,626 --> 01:25:01,026
...you shouldn't be stopped
by paperwork.

984
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:04,255
I think I love you.

985
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:09,660
You don't have a problem
with chick skaters?

986
01:25:09,838 --> 01:25:12,068
No. Why? Should I?

987
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:14,764
You shouldn't.

988
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:22,948
I'm sorry about everything. About...

989
01:25:23,718 --> 01:25:25,845
I was so caught up in my own trip...

990
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:30,480
...I totally didn't see you
for who you were.

991
01:25:33,495 --> 01:25:35,360
Who am I to you?

992
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,724
I don't know.

993
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:43,196
But...

994
01:25:45,073 --> 01:25:47,132
...I really want to find out.

995
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:52,074
Find out.

996
01:25:52,247 --> 01:25:53,680
Yeah?

997
01:26:17,038 --> 01:26:18,835
We're up next.

998
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:25,271
This is it.

999
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:29,714
No matter what happens,
I'm so glad that you guys stuck with me.

1000
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:33,682
- I'm glad we did this together.
- We've had a ride, all right.

1001
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:35,990
Bro, you got me out of your garage...

1002
01:26:36,157 --> 01:26:39,354
...talking to the clowns,
chicks are starting to look at me.

1003
01:26:39,561 --> 01:26:42,086
That's because you don't smell
like anus anymore.

1004
01:26:44,799 --> 01:26:48,257
I'm pissed that I'm broke,
but it was worth the money to be here.

1005
01:26:48,469 --> 01:26:50,960
Even if we choke out there.

1006
01:26:54,609 --> 01:26:56,133
I love you, Eric.

1007
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:00,242
Why did you do that?

1008
01:27:00,415 --> 01:27:02,747
I'm psyching you up, dude!

1009
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:06,011
Could you psych me up
a little softer next time?

1010
01:27:06,187 --> 01:27:10,954
Sweet Lou. My sister wanted
me to give you this. It's her nose.

1011
01:27:21,769 --> 01:27:23,361
All right, boys. Get on it.

1012
01:27:23,538 --> 01:27:26,598
<i>Santa Monica, it is time to get busy...</i>

1013
01:27:26,808 --> 01:27:30,539
...because next up, we have four cats
that you might not have heard of.

1014
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:35,911
They are Eric Rivers, Dustin Knight,
Matt Jensen and Sweet Lou Singer.

1015
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:40,453
If you haven't heard of these kids,
guess what. We are all in the same boat.

1016
01:27:40,622 --> 01:27:43,147
But they are here,
they're ready to get busy.

1017
01:27:43,324 --> 01:27:48,557
They're representing Super Duper
Skateboards. Let's take it to the street.

1018
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:26,388
Oh, God. What's up?

1019
01:29:26,594 --> 01:29:28,994
Just keeping an eye out
for something special.

1020
01:29:29,163 --> 01:29:31,427
- See something you like?
- Maybe.

1021
01:29:31,599 --> 01:29:33,863
Oh, my God!

1022
01:29:50,418 --> 01:29:52,852
What's up, dog?
Didn't I tell you to break out, fool?

1023
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:55,716
I just don't like you, fool. Bounce.

1024
01:29:57,725 --> 01:29:58,885
You know what?

1025
01:29:59,093 --> 01:30:00,651
- What?
- You and me.

1026
01:30:00,862 --> 01:30:02,989
- Oh, hells yeah!
- Get him, dog!

1027
01:30:03,197 --> 01:30:05,791
He's gonna hand you your ass, punk.

1028
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,025
You gonna take that side? All right.

1029
01:34:20,354 --> 01:34:22,845
- Eric!
- Go, Eric!

1030
01:35:52,713 --> 01:35:55,204
I've never seen anything like that.

1031
01:35:55,382 --> 01:35:58,681
Seriously, your batwing,
dude, that was...

1032
01:36:01,188 --> 01:36:05,249
Yo, dog, I always be up in your business,
but, you know...

1033
01:36:06,127 --> 01:36:08,618
That was tight, dude! You crazy, dog!

1034
01:36:10,030 --> 01:36:12,555
- Hey, sorry about what I said.
- That's all right.

1035
01:36:12,867 --> 01:36:14,664
Hey, 40s on me, everybody!

1036
01:36:14,835 --> 01:36:18,032
Yo, but we're still taking your girl.

1037
01:36:18,739 --> 01:36:22,197
- That's not gonna happen.
- Take her, dude.

1038
01:36:22,376 --> 01:36:25,004
All right, man. Hey, peace.

1039
01:36:25,479 --> 01:36:27,106
- Peace out.
- See you guys.

1040
01:36:28,182 --> 01:36:29,843
Seriously...

1041
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:32,711
...that was awesome!
- Thank you.

1042
01:36:32,887 --> 01:36:35,287
I've never seen skating like that. Hey!

1043
01:36:35,456 --> 01:36:37,947
- That counts for something.
- Hell, yeah, it does.

1044
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:41,151
By the way, guys,
I think I'm done playing the field.

1045
01:36:41,362 --> 01:36:44,388
- Yeah, right.
- No, Sweet Lou's in love.

1046
01:36:44,598 --> 01:36:47,032
It's crazy, I know. They're clowns.

1047
01:36:47,434 --> 01:36:50,870
You were so good! I didn't know
you could skateboard like that.

1048
01:36:51,038 --> 01:36:53,802
You're all really great.

1049
01:36:54,241 --> 01:36:56,573
Hey, I don't think Jimmy saw us.

1050
01:36:57,611 --> 01:36:59,238
Sorry, man.

1051
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:09,883
I gotta get back to my dad's shop
and mix some paint.

1052
01:37:10,391 --> 01:37:12,086
Have you talked to Jamie lately?

1053
01:37:12,293 --> 01:37:15,990
Yeah, I got ahold of her last weekend.
She was up in Toronto somewhere.

1054
01:37:16,197 --> 01:37:20,293
It's so freaking hard to track her down
when she's here, there and everywhere.

1055
01:37:22,203 --> 01:37:24,364
Dude, Sweet Lou called me yesterday.

1056
01:37:24,538 --> 01:37:26,802
No way! How is he liking the circus?

1057
01:37:26,974 --> 01:37:29,033
He's loving the circus.

1058
01:37:30,110 --> 01:37:32,772
I can't believe that dude's
in the circus with my sister.

1059
01:37:32,947 --> 01:37:35,939
He's pulling her finger as we speak.

1060
01:37:36,984 --> 01:37:39,748
Seriously, you can't say
this wasn't a good summer.

1061
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:43,549
Dude, I mean, we tried, and that's
more than most people can say.

1062
01:37:45,392 --> 01:37:47,417
No way!

1063
01:37:58,339 --> 01:38:01,035
Hey, guys. We've been looking
everywhere for you.

1064
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:03,608
I brought someone
who wants to meet you.

1065
01:38:03,811 --> 01:38:06,336
So I saw this tape on my bus...

1066
01:38:06,513 --> 01:38:08,743
...and Jamie sat me down
and made me watch it.

1067
01:38:08,916 --> 01:38:10,907
You pulled some sick stuff
in Santa Monica.

1068
01:38:11,418 --> 01:38:14,512
He found a tape on the bus.
What do you know?

1069
01:38:14,955 --> 01:38:16,855
Would you like to join me on tour?

1070
01:38:18,459 --> 01:38:19,983
What?

1071
01:38:20,494 --> 01:38:22,291
Yes, we will. Yeah.

1072
01:38:22,930 --> 01:38:25,797
- Let's go.
- Let's do it, man!

1073
01:38:27,001 --> 01:38:28,559
So...

1074
01:38:31,305 --> 01:38:34,468
- What's up?
- Find out.

1075
01:38:49,390 --> 01:38:53,622
Rivers, seriously, please,
while we're young.

1076
01:38:59,233 --> 01:39:02,999
I know your board is all cracked up,
but you've gotta start spending money.

1077
01:39:03,170 --> 01:39:04,637
Because money-spending is good.

1078
01:39:05,072 --> 01:39:07,802
- Eric!
- Good to see you, bro.

1079
01:39:07,975 --> 01:39:09,203
- Big love.
- You too.

1080
01:39:09,376 --> 01:39:11,503
I'm gonna need a bunch of my decks.

1081
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:13,508
- Yeah, I could do that.
- Cool.

1082
01:39:13,681 --> 01:39:16,172
Dude, it's Eric Rivers, here in person.

1083
01:39:20,721 --> 01:39:21,983
- "Rivers."
- Cool, dude.

1084
01:39:22,156 --> 01:39:24,852
I saw your demo down in Springfield.
You're awesome.

1085
01:39:25,059 --> 01:39:28,688
- Cool, thanks. You got a pen, real quick?
- Yeah.

1086
01:39:35,035 --> 01:39:36,161
Cool.

1087
01:39:36,337 --> 01:39:39,568
Your board is pretty thrashed.
There you go. Thanks, Greg.

1088
01:40:00,928 --> 01:40:02,520
We're the dopest shit in the movie.

1089
01:40:02,863 --> 01:40:04,125
Ladies.

1090
01:40:05,632 --> 01:40:08,362
I really...
All right, real quick.

1091
01:40:08,535 --> 01:40:09,866
See you in the bean suit.

1092
01:40:10,037 --> 01:40:12,028
Dude, I'm dropping pebbles.

1093
01:40:12,206 --> 01:40:15,403
<i>Here we go. And action!</i>

1094
01:40:21,081 --> 01:40:22,548
Cut!

1095
01:40:22,716 --> 01:40:24,343
- Can I make a suggestion?
- Yeah.

1096
01:40:24,518 --> 01:40:26,713
Why don't you direct your way
to the 40s.

1097
01:40:34,395 --> 01:40:35,589
We gotta redo that.

1098
01:40:51,545 --> 01:40:53,103
How's Mountain Gleebin
and Globin?

1099
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:57,683
<i>Casey La Scala</i>
<i>Just for a dollar</i>

1100
01:40:59,953 --> 01:41:01,443
How big you want me to go?

1101
01:41:02,089 --> 01:41:03,386
Cut.

1102
01:41:03,557 --> 01:41:07,721
I didn't recognize you in the bright lights.

1103
01:41:11,065 --> 01:41:12,327
Oh, crikey.

1104
01:41:22,009 --> 01:41:23,533
She sure was a slippery one.

1105
01:41:27,181 --> 01:41:28,705
Sweet Lou!

1106
01:42:46,126 --> 01:42:48,754
You think we're gonna have
a sequel, or what?

1107
01:42:48,962 --> 01:42:52,420
I heard you're not in it,
so I don't know, I can't talk about it.

1108
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:41,403
<i>Peace out!</i>
