00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:17,274
It's all about opportunity,

333
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:18,623
I guess so, man, I guess so.

335
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:24,586
Playin' with guns, man.

336
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:28,155
What am I gonna do, man,
I don't want these things.

337
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:29,547
Shit, I'll take one.

338
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:32,333
You'll take one.

339
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:33,464
I'll take two.

340
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:37,686
What are you gonna do, maybe,
except shoot
yourself in the foot.

341
00:13:37,729 --> 00:13:38,992
Come on.

342
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:40,428
Shoot you in the head,

343
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:43,213
Johnny, serious, man.

344
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:45,955
You know people want

345
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:47,565
Fuck yeah, man.

Hey Tommy, man,

00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:13,243

Fuckin' right I am,

00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,032
Ten bucks for this thing.

Ah, ten bucks, that's -

00:14:21,773 --> 00:14:23,558

358
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:28,911
I'll leave the big scores

359
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:31,740
Tommy, look at this radio,

360
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:33,002
Mega bass!

361
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:34,743
It's got left
and right volumes.

362
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,267
Things got
a tape in here, even.

363
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,052
Look, I give you
the tape for free, all right?

364
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:40,227
How about this?

365
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,445
What - what's that?

366
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:42,533
It's a lollipop,
what you think it is?

367
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:45,623
I didn't see ... what you got?

368
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:46,973
Hey, hey, hey, go ahead,

369
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:48,539
Oh I don't know, I don't know.
Want to buy it?

370
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,280
How much you want, man?

371
00:14:50,324 --> 00:14:51,238
How much you wanna pay?

372
00:14:52,543 --> 00:14:54,197
Shit,
I'll give you fifty dollars -

373
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:56,025
Fifty dollars, man, you got
another thing coming,
D'Artagnan.

374
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:57,374
Fifty fuckin' dollars.

375
00:14:57,418 --> 00:14:58,941
How much you think it's worth?

376
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:01,639
Yeah, I know how
much I'll get, man,
the thing shoots,

377
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,513
All right, seriously.

378
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:07,689
You know, how much, you know,
how much you think
we could get for this?

379
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,692
You probably could get
two hundred dollars for that.

380
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:14,130
Oh, is that all?

381
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:23,052
He's a greasy motherfucker,
Tommy, though.

382
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:24,097
He is.

383
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:26,099
There's no doubt about it.

384
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:28,579
I don't trust the guy -

385
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:31,321
Hey, what the fuck
are you doin', man?

386
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:32,453
What's the matter, I hurt you?

387
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:34,542
Yeah,
I'll fuckin' slap you, Sal

388
00:15:34,585 --> 00:15:37,371

I need a word with
your boy here, you mind?

393
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,030
With him?

394
00:15:44,073 --> 00:15:46,206
Yeah. I need to talk
to him for a minute.
Give us a minute?

395
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:47,990
-Tell him it's all right.
Jimmy, huh?
-All right, man, it's cool

396
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:49,252
Just a couple minutes?

No problem, all right.

672
00:27:55,891 --> 00:27:57,153
Johnny No Bones,
how you feeling, man?

673
00:27:57,197 --> 00:27:59,068
I'm very good, thank you.

674
00:27:59,112 --> 00:28:00,896
You mind if I give your
old lady a little kiss?
You don't mind, No Bones?

675
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,680
-How you doin', sweetheart?
-How you've been?

676
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:05,379
Man of the hour.

677
00:28:05,422 --> 00:28:07,381
Nice to see you,
Sal, good to see you.

678
00:28:07,424 --> 00:28:09,209
-You just get here?
-Yeah, man, pretty much.

679
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:10,297
-Florida, right?
-Yeah.

680
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,646
-Good suntan, eh?
-How you doin'?

681
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,387
-All right man, you look good.
-Yeah, you too.

682
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:16,520
See you inside, man.

683
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:20,568
I heard a lot of
shit about you man.

684
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:22,831
FRANKIE: About who? About me?

685
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,485
A lot of shit about this guy.

686
00:28:24,528 --> 00:28:25,486
FRANKIE: What kind of shit?

687
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:28,097
Hey, don't you know somebody
I know down there?

688
00:28:28,837 --> 00:28:30,665
Who is that?

689
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,928
Tryin' to remember...
you know this guy.

690
00:28:32,972 --> 00:28:33,886
-Don't hurt yourself.
-Shut up.

691
00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:37,106
Eddie.. Eddie Lumbaski.

692
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,281
-Oh,
from the old neighborhood.
-Yeah.

693
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:40,719
I know him.

694
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:41,502
Yous two got
busted together, right?

695
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:43,547
Not really.

696
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:48,727
Hey, you share
the same cell there?

697
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:52,208
Yeah, in fact, that guy's
the uncle of my sister-in-law.

698
00:28:53,122 --> 00:28:54,341
-Eddie Lumbaski.
-Eddie...

699
00:28:55,255 --> 00:28:56,517
He says you ratted him out.

700
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,561
What?

701
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:00,173
What? What kind of shit
is that to say, Sal, huh?

702
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:01,957
You serious?

703
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:04,481
I never ratted out on nobody
in my whole life,
and you know that.

704
00:29:04,525 --> 00:29:06,875
-And so does he.
-Oh I know that, do I, eh?

705
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:07,876
Yeah.
Well you should if you don't.

706
00:29:10,574 --> 00:29:12,098
-Maybe I'm mistaken.
-Maybe you are.

707
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:15,014
Maybe somebody's
lyin' to me, right?

708
00:29:15,057 --> 00:29:16,363
Maybe they are, Sal.

709
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:18,017
Could be,
happens all the time.

710
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,583
Yeah, man. I know.

711
00:29:19,627 --> 00:29:20,802
-I'll see ya.
-I'm gonna buy you a beer.

712
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:21,934
-Yeah, with my money, right?
-Yeah.

713
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:26,373
-Take care.
-Say hello to
your sister for me.

714
00:29:28,418 --> 00:29:29,419
What was that about?

715
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:30,769
Shut up.

716
00:29:32,596 --> 00:29:33,554
Frank, you all right with him?

717
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:36,383
I got no problems.

718
00:29:36,426 --> 00:29:38,211
Then what's that
shit he's talking about?

719
00:29:38,254 --> 00:29:39,342
You gotta ask him, Jimmy.

720
00:29:39,386 --> 00:29:42,606
No, no, Frankie.
I'm asking you, man.

721
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,391
Well I don't know
nothin' about it, all right?

722
00:29:45,218 --> 00:29:47,437
-Nothin, huh?
-No.

723
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:49,657
No. I know he's
outta line right there,
that's what I fuckin' know.

724
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,180
That's a serious
accusation right there.

725
00:29:51,224 --> 00:29:52,486
Motherfuckin' right it is.

726
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:54,357
He don't know what the fuck
he's talkin' about.

727
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:55,402
Thumbs broken
for shit like that.

728
00:29:57,665 --> 00:29:58,797
Okay, Frankie.

729
00:30:00,973 --> 00:30:02,626
You got a blanket,
not that you'll need it...

730
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:06,195
a clean towel...

731
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:10,025
and anything you
want out of the fridge,
help yourself, okay?

732
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:11,461
And do me a favor, man.

733
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:14,029
Don't wake me up
in the morning,
I like to sleep

734
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:15,596
All right.
Jimmy, thanks a lot, man.

735
00:30:16,989 --> 00:30:17,990
Listen, you got cable?

736
00:30:18,991 --> 00:30:20,819
Hey. This is Brooklyn.

737
00:30:22,124 --> 00:30:23,996
Oh. All right.

738
00:30:24,997 --> 00:30:25,998
No cable, huh?

739
00:30:32,178 --> 00:30:33,179
Hey.

740
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,182
Hey, Denise.

741
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,794
Where's Jimmy?

742
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:42,536
Uh, he's here.

743
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:43,667
He's takin'
a shower or somethin'.

744
00:30:46,453 --> 00:30:47,454
You spendin' the night here?

745
00:30:49,064 --> 00:30:50,849
Yeah. I was hopin' to.

746
00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:54,417
Jimmy didn't say nothin'
to you about it?

747
00:30:55,114 --> 00:30:56,115
Nope.

748
00:30:58,465 --> 00:30:59,640
If it's an inconvenience,

749
00:31:01,294 --> 00:31:02,295
I could go.

750
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:04,863
It's not
an inconvenience to me, no.

751
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,431
Thanks.

752
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:13,262
So, you guys had
a little bit of
fun tonight, huh?

753
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:16,657
Just hangin' out, you know.

754
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:22,054
Big bash you guys had, right?

755
00:31:22,097 --> 00:31:23,316
Not that big, nah.

756
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:33,761
Heard you was down in
Florida for a while.

757
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:36,895
Yeah.

758
00:31:37,678 --> 00:31:38,722
Yeah, I was down there.

759
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:40,115
Sounds nice.

760
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:40,899
Yeah, it was all right.

761
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:43,162
Nice. You look good.

762
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:44,772
Thanks, Frankie.

763
00:31:48,515 --> 00:31:50,038
-So what happened
to you down there?
-What?

764
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,127
What happened to
you down in Florida?

765
00:31:53,824 --> 00:31:55,957
What do you mean,
what happened?

766
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:57,263
I don't know, what did you,
get thrown in jail?

767
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:01,093
No.
Didn't get thrown in no jail.

768
00:32:03,617 --> 00:32:05,749
I mean, not for no
period of time or nothin',
if that's what you mean.

769
00:32:07,316 --> 00:32:09,101
I mean
the reason you left here
in the first place

770
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:10,537
is they were going to
throw you in jail, right?

771
00:32:12,626 --> 00:32:13,757
Nah, it was more like,

772
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:17,413
I was like I wanted a
change of pace, really.

773
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:20,895
'Cause they were gonna
throw you up in Rikers.

774
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:24,159
Yeah, that's right, Denise.

775
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:31,340
Got any plans now, Frankie?

776
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:34,778
Hm?

777
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:36,693
Got any plans now?

778
00:32:38,086 --> 00:32:39,087
Yeah, I got plans.

779
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,525
Concerning what?

780
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:44,310
You know, any plans.

781
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:47,966
Yeah.

782
00:32:49,315 --> 00:32:50,316
Yeah, I got plans.

783
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:53,754
Think you'll manage to
stay out of jail for a while?

784
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:57,584
Nobody plans on
going to jail, Denise.

785
00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:02,589
I don't know,
seems like you do.

786
00:33:02,632 --> 00:33:05,548
Right. Things happen
sometimes, you know?

787
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:07,637
Oh, I know, you're one
of those people, right,

788
00:33:07,681 --> 00:33:10,162
that things just sort
of happen to you, right.

789
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:12,599
It's not like these things are
your fault or anything, right?

790
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:17,952
I'm just trying to
live my life, you know...

791
00:33:20,868 --> 00:33:24,785
Sometimes I do things,
and I get in trouble for it.

792
00:33:27,483 --> 00:33:30,791
I'm just trying to
do what I like to do,
you know, I'm trying to live.

793
00:33:34,882 --> 00:33:35,622
You should try it some time.

794
00:33:39,626 --> 00:33:40,627
I do okay.

795
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:45,414
Well I see that...

796
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:49,027
I mean, you got a lotta -
lotta nice stuff around here.

797
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:50,637
This stuff is you.

798
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:53,857
Ah,
it's good - it's good enough
for some people.

799
00:33:55,642 --> 00:33:56,643
It's good enough for you.

800
00:33:58,471 --> 00:33:59,211
You're sittin' on it.

801
00:34:00,473 --> 00:34:01,474
You're watchin' it.

802
00:34:03,258 --> 00:34:04,042
You're drinkin' it.

803
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,783
Am I right?

804
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,050
I'm goin to bed, Frankie,
I've been workin all night.

805
00:34:16,663 --> 00:34:17,664
Good night, Denise.

806
00:34:42,645 --> 00:34:44,691
-What's up?
-Nothing.

807
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:46,084
-What's up with you?
-Nothing.

808
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:48,129
How was work?

809
00:34:48,173 --> 00:34:49,130
It was work.

810
00:34:49,957 --> 00:34:51,698
-Work was good.
-Yeah?

811
00:34:51,741 --> 00:34:52,873
Work was good again,
it's always good.

812
00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:56,920
Good.
Did you meet our houseguest?

813
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:00,272
Our houseguest? Yes.

814
00:35:00,315 --> 00:35:02,535
Yes, I met our houseguest.

815
00:35:02,578 --> 00:35:04,319
He'll be gone in the morning,
okay.

816
00:35:04,363 --> 00:35:05,494
Yeah, so will our TV .

817
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,149
It's not funny.

818
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:09,368
You got your
wallet in here, right?

819
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,718
Shh.

820
00:35:11,761 --> 00:35:13,154
-Shh what?
-Quiet. He's gonna hear.

821
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:14,547
I don't care if he hears me.

822
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,985
He's startin' fights
in my bar, what is this?

823
00:35:18,028 --> 00:35:20,118
Oh, I see, it's your bar now?

824
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:21,858
It's my bar, yeah.

825
00:35:21,902 --> 00:35:23,469
It's my fuckin' bar
when I work there.

826
00:35:24,383 --> 00:35:25,688
So you don't like my friends?

827
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:26,907
No, you have great friends.

828
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,213
Just don't bring it
to the bar with you.

829
00:35:29,214 --> 00:35:30,780
I don't need this.

830
00:35:30,824 --> 00:35:32,130
What should I do,
leave them in the car?

831
00:35:34,001 --> 00:35:36,743
Yes, you should
leave 'em in the car.

832
00:35:36,786 --> 00:35:38,832
You come inside and leave
all your great
friends in the car

833
00:35:39,876 --> 00:35:41,269
Should I leave
the windows cranked?

834
00:35:41,313 --> 00:35:42,966
Don't crank the windows, why?

835
00:35:48,755 --> 00:35:50,104
-So.
-So.

836
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:53,847
Frankie's watching the TV.

837
00:35:54,674 --> 00:35:55,979
Yeah.

838
00:35:56,023 --> 00:35:58,460
And there's no food
in the refrigerator.

839
00:35:58,504 --> 00:35:59,505
So what are you sayin'?

840
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,551
There's nothin' to read.

841
00:36:02,595 --> 00:36:04,162
I can't read anyway.

842
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:05,772
No?

843
00:36:05,815 --> 00:36:07,774
-What are you saying to me?
-Read my lips.

844
00:36:07,817 --> 00:36:08,818

-No,
you know what I was thinkin'?
-What?

1089
00:46:48,109 --> 00:46:49,981
I was thinkin'
that we should have
Mr. McGonegal come over

1090
00:46:50,024 --> 00:46:51,678
and take a look at
these things, right?

1091
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:53,941
You know,
he'll tell us more about -em
or something, right?

1092
00:46:53,985 --> 00:46:56,509
It's not like it's, you know,
violating your probation

in the fuckin' house, right?

Why don't we call
him on the phone
and we'll find out, you know.

1096

over for dinner -

00:47:04,865 --> 00:47:06,475
There you go. Right.

1098
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:08,390

I'll give you his number,

1101
00:47:13,439 --> 00:47:14,919
I'll put 'em away, all right?

00:47:14,962 --> 00:47:16,616

that's good, that's very good.

are worth a lot of money.

think maybe you should
go home and talk to her?

throw them under the bed,
all right?

1123
00:47:59,093 --> 00:48:01,226

ever gonna think
to look underneath the bed.

anything to me, you know.

DENISE:
Her name used to be Laurie.
CELIA: She's a little girl.

1825
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,827
She doesn't have a...
Her sister had a kid.

01:22:04,049 --> 01:22:06,443
I'm all right.
Last time I saw her
she had a skirt

1829
01:22:06,486 --> 01:22:08,184
DENISE: Holy shit.

1830
01:22:08,227 --> 01:22:09,968
I can't believe
that little baby,
she's too little for a kid.

1831
01:22:10,012 --> 01:22:11,970
DENISE:
She can't fuckin' have a kid,
she's like eleven years old.

1832
01:22:12,014 --> 01:22:13,972
FRANKIE: Check it out, Ceil.

01:22:20,848 --> 01:22:22,981
-Is my door open?
-Yeah. Is it open?

1837
01:22:23,025 --> 01:22:27,290
My door open?
You're pushing my

1838
01:22:27,333 --> 01:22:30,423
-Why do you want to know?
-I want to get
something outta there.

1839
01:22:30,467 --> 01:22:32,817
Well then tell me that,
I'll let you into my house.

1840
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:35,385
Okay. Excuse me, Denise,
I want to get

1841
01:22:35,428 --> 01:22:36,777
Can I get in the house?

1842
01:22:38,431 --> 01:22:40,346
It's Gloria's kid.
It's gotta be Gloria's kid.

1843
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:42,044
TERRY: I gotta go home.

1844
01:22:42,087 --> 01:22:43,784
CELIA:

1845
01:22:43,828 --> 01:22:45,177

01:22:45,221 --> 01:22:48,615
CELIA: Denise,

1847
01:22:48,659 --> 01:22:51,183
No,

01:22:51,227 --> 01:22:53,620

-I know, I am too.

1849
01:22:53,664 --> 01:22:55,753
I don't know why,
I 'don't know how come.

1850
01:22:55,796 --> 01:22:57,711
You know what I'm thinkin'.
It was that one Laurie.

1851
01:22:57,755 --> 01:22:59,670
Laurie that
used to work there.

1852
01:22:59,713 --> 01:23:02,020
That other girl, right?
Because the other one,

1853

like ten or somethin .

1854
01:23:03,152 --> 01:23:04,631
What's this?

1855
01:23:04,675 --> 01:23:06,198
No, she's fifteen,
the other one's
fifteen years old.

1856
01:23:06,242 --> 01:23:07,808
All right,
because the other one's
like nine or ten.

1857
01:23:07,852 --> 01:23:09,245
I seen her coming
down the street,
I thought it was her.

1858
01:23:09,288 --> 01:23:10,724
-Yeah.
-I thought it
was the same one.

1859
01:23:10,768 --> 01:23:12,639
CELIA: Yeah. You know, uh -

1860
01:23:12,683 --> 01:23:14,032
FRANKIE:
There's stuff missing out
of my bag here.

1861
01:23:14,076 --> 01:23:15,338
Terry looks good, right?

1862
01:23:15,381 --> 01:23:16,774
There's stuff missing
outta my bag.

1863
01:23:16,817 --> 01:23:18,167
DENISE: Terry looks great.
CELIA: She looks amazing.

1864
01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:19,342
DENISE: I don't know
anything about it, Frankie.

1865
01:23:19,385 --> 01:23:20,821
-No?
-Uh-uh.

1866
01:23:20,865 --> 01:23:22,214
And I was telling her,
I told her the same thing.

1867
01:23:22,258 --> 01:23:23,650
I told her too. I can't do it.

1868
01:23:23,694 --> 01:23:25,739
Even if you did,
even if you did
like strawberry.

1869
01:23:25,783 --> 01:23:27,176
I ca - the bottom of
this is still like -

1870
01:23:27,219 --> 01:23:28,742
From three years ago,
it was still like crispy.

1871
01:23:28,786 --> 01:23:30,048
Yeah but she no - she could do
it for you, it would work.

1872
01:23:30,092 --> 01:23:31,136
-Wh - where's Jimmy?
-Jimmy went out.

1873
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:32,616
Yeah, where'd he go?

1874
01:23:32,659 --> 01:23:34,096
Where did he go? I don't know,
I have no idea, Frankie.

1875
01:23:34,139 --> 01:23:35,793
CELIA: Right about there.

1876
01:23:35,836 --> 01:23:38,013
-Oh,
you don't know where he is.
-I don't know

1877
01:23:38,056 --> 01:23:39,710
CELIA: Bring out your eyes,
you have pretty eyes,
you know?

1878
01:23:39,753 --> 01:23:41,146
She told me she
would do it, I know.

1879
01:23:41,190 --> 01:23:43,105
I'd love to see it, you know,
off your face, too.

1880
01:23:43,148 --> 01:23:44,454
You know, there's -
there's some
very important stuff

1881
01:23:44,497 --> 01:23:45,716
missing outta my bag here.

01:23:45,759 --> 01:23:47,500
-What, your guns, Frankie?
-Yeah, my guns.

1883
01:23:47,544 --> 01:23:49,502
I don't know
nothin about your guns.

1884
01:23:49,546 --> 01:23:51,504
I could give a shit
about your stupid guns
sitting here in my apartment.

1885
01:23:51,548 --> 01:23:52,897
Your guns. You leave your guns
in people's houses?

1886
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:54,594
You could give a shit, huh.
Yeah?

1887
01:23:54,638 --> 01:23:56,292
You know I got 'em
but you don't know
anything about it, huh?

1888
01:23:56,335 --> 01:23:58,076
I know they were here, yeah,

where they are now.

1889
01:23:58,120 --> 01:23:59,904
-Yeah, who took 'em?
-Who took 'em,
I have no idea, Frankie.

1890
01:23:59,947 --> 01:24:01,253
-You got no idea.
-I have no idea,
how would I know.

1891
01:24:01,297 --> 01:24:02,689
CELIA: Frankie.

1892
01:24:02,733 --> 01:24:03,995
How would you know,
this is your house, right?

1893
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:05,649
You don't know nothin about
what comes and goes

1894
01:24:05,692 --> 01:24:07,216

fuckin' house, Denise?

1896
01:24:08,956 --> 01:24:11,220
Listen, don't - don't use
foul language in her house.

1897
01:24:11,263 --> 01:24:13,526
Look no one's talkin' to you,
all right, Celia?
So mind your business.

1898
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:15,398
And nobody's
talking to you, Frankie.

1899
01:24:15,441 --> 01:24:17,748
Listen, I'm sorry,
don't raise your voice.
This is my friend's house.

1900
01:24:17,791 --> 01:24:19,445

-Frankie, that's outta line.
Don't go -
-You're fuckin'

1934
01:26:32,056 --> 01:26:34,798
-You see Jimmy Lankin?
-MAN: Jimmy, I don't know.

I don't like your mom, okay?

1942
01:27:02,913 --> 01:27:04,828
No, you did, I told her
you liked her meat loaf.

1943
01:27:04,871 --> 01:27:06,438
What?

1944
01:27:06,482 --> 01:27:07,874
She made fuckin' forty pounds
of meat loaf for you, Jimmy.

1945
01:27:07,918 --> 01:27:09,485
Why did your mother
marry your father?

1946
01:27:09,528 --> 01:27:13,663
So don't... say nothin' mean,
she totally loves you.

01:27:13,706 --> 01:27:16,448
Why did your father
marry your mother?

01:27:16,492 --> 01:27:18,494
-JIMMI: Hey!

Nothing.

01:27:23,977 --> 01:27:25,718
Listen, I don't want you
to worry about anything,

1951
01:27:27,111 --> 01:27:29,635

Okay,

1960
01:27:50,743 --> 01:27:52,702
-Let you handle it.

-You're more diplomatic.
-Yeah.

1962
01:27:54,921 --> 01:27:57,663
-What does that mean?
-Just what I said.

1963
01:27:57,707 --> 01:27:59,491
No, I'm gonna take
care of this, all right.

1964
01:27:59,535 --> 01:28:01,188

01:28:10,546 --> 01:28:12,417
I'm fine, I'm relaxed,
I'm totally relaxed.

1971
01:28:12,461 --> 01:28:14,201
I'm gonna do what?

01:28:14,245 --> 01:28:17,292
-Go watch television,
read a book...
-Fine. Fine. Fine.

1973
01:28:17,335 --> 01:28:19,685
Read a fuckin magazine,
have a beer,
