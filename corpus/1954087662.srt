1
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:08,736
I'm late?

2
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,738
Hi. No!

3
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:13,282
Uh though. Five minutes
finally I did not count.

4
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,201
- But we came here for.
- Yeah.

5
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:17,620
- It is...
- Oh... Yeah.

6
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:21,290
- It's gone?
- Uh...

7
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,667
Listen, about that...

8
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,419
Brian.
Can tell you like me?

9
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,379
Yeah. Really.

10
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,465
And I like you too, attention,

11
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:33,427
but I do not see why we
refused to offer a guarantee.

12
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:37,348
Yeah.

13
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,225
Course.

14
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:40,851
More... Do you feel ready?

15
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:42,186
Brian!

16
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:43,979
- Okay.
- Super.

17
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:44,939
Yeah, great.

18
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,162
Oona! Hello.
This is another attempt?

19
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:04,166
Yes. Welcome back, Patty.
This is Brian.

20
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,128
Welcome, Brian. You're ready to take the plunge
?

21
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,421
Uh, Abso... absolutely.

22
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,510
This is gone, come with me.
I take care of you.

23
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,975
Say, Oona, how did you guys
returned to this place?

24
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,061
I had some disappointments in my life
.

25
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,771
You'll swear you're in the house.

26
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:29,275
Please.

27
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,278
- Thank you. I have...
- You lie.

28
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,573
Well are you ready?

29
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,616
I need an ID
and a credit card picture.

30
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:38,993
Of course, yes.

31
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:43,831
- Sorry.
- OK. This is good.

32
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,459
How long have you dating?

33
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:48,878
A little over a month.

34
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,214
Brian Thompson?
Man, thirty-three years!

35
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,425
How you survived without Timer?

36
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:56,427
- I lived in Oklahoma.
- I understood.

37
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,221
Caucasian. Straight.
I hope it lasts!

38
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:03,392
And your personality tests
are available on the net.

39
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,103

00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,700
What... What is

45
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:21,994
It's just uh...

00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:25,247
You will not be refunded
if you find you waiting

47
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:28,042
your great love
too long or not enough. Or, for example,

48
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:30,377
if you get on a roll.

49
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,881
You will, uh...
It is supposed to be guaranteed...

50
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:36,300
Fall on true love.
This is the principle?

51
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:39,637
No. This is not required.
Not at first.

52
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,765
I'll give you a brochure
on the path to true love.

53
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,392
So obviously, there is the
thunderbolt.

54
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,645
But he also
friendship that turns into love it.

55
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:51,106
Enemies who become lovers.
The intellectual attraction, etc..

56
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:54,568
The timer indicates the time when
great love into your life.

57
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,362
For the rest,
is up to you to manage.

58
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,532
We were already ahead of the game.
Huh?

59
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,497
This is true, it changes nothing.
Go.

60
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,500
Great! Super!

61
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:12,086
OK, Brian.
You're right or left handed?

62
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:12,962
Left.

63
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:19,551
It's what you do?
I want to say we're going to do now?

64
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,512
It seems to hurt.
Does it hurt?

65
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,138
It's like getting your ears pierced.

66
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,556
I have not pierced ears, I...

67
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,392
This is a bit painful, but
is very brief.

68
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,561
Listen. Just after implantation

69
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,355
if you are made for each other,

70
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:33,774
then your two Timers
blow at the same time.

71
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,070
And then deep love. Is it good?

72
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,990
Course. Super.
On... I'm ready!

73
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,538
Oona.

74
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:50,291
You know that it sounds
must look in the eyes.

75
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:57,715
The best part of my day.
Drum roll!

76
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,057
Sweet jesus.

77
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,069
Nine hundred and sixteen days.

78
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:30,622
I Filoche.

79
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,126
Oona, I'm sorry.

80
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:36,128
This is really great.

81
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,631
All is well. I...
'm Very happy for you both.

82
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,592
You see, that's why
I wanted to come here.

83
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,178
- This is the situation that I wanted...
- But it will not. Really.

84
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,055
I usually, you know.

85
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:48,265
This is great.

86
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,313
Nine hundred sixteen days
it's almost...

87
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,316
Two and a half years.

88
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:58,984
Two and a half years.

89
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:02,363
I have finished my studies, I am
doctor.

90
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:05,657
Fingers crossed.

91
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,410
[This is the perfect time, in fact.

92
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,539
It's still crazy
to say it is outside.

93
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,875
She wanders,
she built her life.

94
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,170
And his little clock that was not lit
years

95
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,339
finally started counting.

96
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:23,884
You know...

97
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,845
Two years is a long time. So maybe
that both could...

98
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:28,389
I understand.

99
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:30,808
This is a mined relationship.

100
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:31,934
Pathetic.

101
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:33,435
Undermined .
This is the word I used.

102
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:35,145
And I told shabby.

103
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,648
This is more appropriate.

104
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,858
Sorry. That's great, I...

105
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,611
I really... Congratulations!

106
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:46,532
This is great. Super.
I gotta get back to work.

107
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,284
- Listen, I was thinking...
- Yes, well then, we...

108
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:52,579
- It was great between us, really.
- It's true.

109
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:53,622
You're great. Really...

110
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,041
This is cute. Not. I'm going.

111
00:06:58,877 --> 00:06:59,711
Take care of yourself.

112
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,883
It's over. Everything you always wanted
is in this box.

113
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,678
See you soon, Oona!

114
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,930
This is one of our regular clients.

115
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,141
Good day, sir.
And keep good timing.

116
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:19,022
If a clock could tell you the exact moment

117
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,691
Where you meet your soul mate

118
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:21,984
would you know?

119
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:25,487
Here is the question that is asked by
a brand new device called

120
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:26,613
Timer.

121
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:29,825
Last technological revolution for meetings

122
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:32,411
Timer shows you the exact time
the person in your life...

123
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:35,747
We discovered that all human beings are
for a person.

124
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:40,294
Set just after puberty
and powered by body heat,

125
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:44,214
Timer allows you to calculate your rate
oxytocin, the hormone of love.

126
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,258
It falls to zero, the previous midnight.

127
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,927
And the next day it may sound
at any time

128
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,137
and there you meet your soul mate.

129
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,890
Tired of waiting for the love in your corner?

130
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,476
These long days are finally behind you.

131
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,978
Say goodbye to cockroach and disappointments.

132
00:07:58,187 --> 00:07:59,646
Time become your best ally.

133
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,732
And love will finally
to go.

134
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,609
With Timer

135
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:07,446
technology is at your service
to tell you who will be your soulmate

136
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:08,739
especially when you meet.

137
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,909
Timer.
Do not let random chance.

138
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:14,244
Take the cake, Monica.

139
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,205
More sugar!
My Timer will soon ring.

140
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,040
- This is when?
- Three years.

141
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,460
A computer planted in the arm?

142
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:22,628
No, no way.

143
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,921
I really know.

144
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,340
- It'll branch?
- It tries thee?

145
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,885
What? Not. I have one.

146
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,847
At first he was a virgin,
it made me a little nervous.

147
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:37,309
But she had one too.
Where it is.

148
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,645
Jane loves dogs. John also.

149
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,523
Stop calculate
is done for you.

150
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:46,026
All
our common interests are just the tip of the iceberg.

151
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,570
We
we speak of true love.

152
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,448
Shared values, needs
emotional, physical attraction.

153
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,952
As of 2005, it is estimated that half of
Americans

154
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,538
age of fourteen
or more will Timers.

155
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:00,416
A recent survey suggests a satisfaction rate of 99%

156
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,585
in people who already have a timer.

157
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,003
It's like a fairy tale.

158
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,172
I
seen from the other side of the room.

159
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:10,175
He ​​looked at me and I knew right away.

160
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,387
Everyone is returned
and people started clapping.

161
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:27,442
For the fifteenth anniversary of the invention of Timer

162
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,319
we met one of those couples.

163
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:32,281
Eric and Tammi had their account
countdown ends there five years.

164
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,283
I was very skeptical about the timer.

165
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,953
I really did not think it was possible that a watch to tell me

166
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,414
like that. But in fact, it is not
how it works.

167
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:43,333
What do you say to people who do not believe
it work?

168
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,253
It does not tell you who to love.

169
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:49,131
It just confirms what you know.

170
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:52,134
What you already feel but

171
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,679
when you're ready...

172
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:57,931
This is a bonus.

173
00:09:58,473 --> 00:09:59,474
It reassuring.

174
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:40,349
What?

175
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:41,642
Why are you whispering?

176
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:45,937
I whisper it.

177
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,689
<i> Where are you </i>

178
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:49,191
In a church.

179
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,402
Brian is not good.

180
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:53,904
<i> Shit! This is not true </i>

181
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,074
Call me when you've found your panties.

182
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:58,575
It works.

183
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:02,079
So?

184
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,413
Brian is not for me.

185
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,085
Hi Priscilla.

186
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,336
'On'our.

187
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,675
If I took off your rings
today is what it looks like to you?

188
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:15,967
'Of our' reason?

189
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,596
Uh... He still has a month
Dr. O'Leary.

190
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,306
It's just there for an adjustment.

191
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,891
Yes, but a month, it has more.

192
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,560
According to my sources, the school
again next week.

193
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,313
My little brother goes to school,
he is the spy.

194
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,192
It has everything to him that child.
It will be a misfortune to college.

195
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,738
Your rings live their last moments, small.

196
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,323
'Is' rop su'er!

197
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,427
You know that the single in the supermarket?

198
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,222
A little old, but funny.

199
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:04,224
Go, I'll do...

200
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,352
It brings its products to the fund

201
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,397
type four rolls of toilet paper,
frozen food, stuff like that.

202
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,400
The cashier looked purchases
and he asks:

203
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:14,901
"Well, you're alone?"

204
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:16,945
Then she blushed a little,

205
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:19,740
type
you decrypted me just seeing my shopping

206
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,658
and the guy said no, you're just ugly
.

207
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,085
I thought it would make you laugh a little.

208
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,129
Really?

209
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,841
In fact, I thought you'd understand
irony.

210
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,844
- This is missed.
- Well, I mean...

211
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,220
As you are super pretty...

212
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,058
Okay. It was fun.

213
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,227
Sincere It's great that I told you.

214
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,981
That you made $ 30.29.

215
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,657
Sorry.

216
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:05,535
Try again.

217
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,459
Give it to me. Thank you.

218
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,888
I see your timer is blank.

219
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:26,973
- So what?
- No, nothing.

220
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,309
You wait until it comes on, huh?

221
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:33,688
This is a pity. If you know how to do it,
this can be very exciting.

222
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,525
I will try to remember.

223
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,318
Mickey.

224
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:41,988
Good evening.

225
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:44,407
For soon.

226
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,159
- Goodbye.
- Take care of yourself.

227
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,999
<i> In the vast jungle of Bangladesh, </i>

228
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,001
<i> Sunni fighters, </i>
<i> called Mwali, </i>

229
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,212
<i> wear masks </i>
<i> the back of their head < / i></i>

230
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:01,299
<i> to scare the tigers of Bengal </i>
<i> attempt to surprise </i>

231
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,394
I note you did you
a half hour late!

232
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,437
Okay, relax.

233
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,147
Jesse whole life ahead of him.

234
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,817
This is not because we will
time it will take the lead.

235
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:19,651
Listening.

236
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,695
If you could put on yours, it would help me
.

237
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,364
Hey, do you not made
smiling,'s date this morning.

238
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,617
This is a process of elimination.

239
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,661
So every defeat
brings me closer to victory.

240
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,788
Here. It is perfect.

241
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,209
Oh, that's out of the question.
No. Put it.

242
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:40,797
Does it have a timer?

243
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,841
Yeah, of course.
I'm not stupid.

244
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:45,886
Guys What Timer not arise too
questions and it stresses me.

245
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:50,056
While those who have a
just want to have fun before the fateful day.

246
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,225
They want to regret anything at all.

247
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,768
They are using you.

248
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,604
And I am using them. All is well.

249
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,605
I do not know...

250
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,899
It is scientifically proven that

251
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:02,944
these guys will make you suffer
and yet you continue to hang out with.

252
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,196
It can not be
as great as you claim.

253
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:10,577
You're right. The bestial sex, furious orgasmic
and is super annoying.

254
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,247
I think you should get a cat.

255
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:14,956
Oona.

256
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:19,127
On a scale of 1 to 10,
it makes you what, shot Brian?

257
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:21,296
6.

258
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,424
6.5. But you know,

259
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,344
okay, it's not even for Brian.

260
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,095
I just want to find the right one.
Do you understand?

261
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,097
Even though I know I not know him before...

262
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,599
What? Your forty?

263
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,938
Yes, Mom. I'm sorry.
We start in the second, I promise.

264
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:46,404
Hi! Sorry for the delay.
We are here!

265
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:47,781
It's his fault!

266
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:49,199
Good evening.

267
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:50,659
Hola.

268
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,538
She has not changed a bit, your mother?

269
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,457
You are!

270
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,126
Hey!

271
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:01,962
- Oh, dear!
- Hi mom.

272
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,255
Hi, Steph.

273
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,341
Girls! This is my wife
household, Luz.

274
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,803
Luz, this is my daughter, Oona
and the daughter of Paul, Steph.

275
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,388
Mucho gusto.

276
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,098
Good evening, Luz!

277
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,475
Thank you for your excellent work.

278
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:16,726
Buenas noches.

279
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,480
Not a word of French.

280
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:23,817
This is so exciting!
Do not you?

281
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:25,068
Where is Brian?

282
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:26,987
It was not good.

283
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,698
Honey. I'm sorry.

284
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:32,867
Why did you bring today?
You have time.

285
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,538
Because you said that we would
a double celebration.

286
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:40,208
Brian was not made for you.
We already knew.

287
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,210
Well said, Marion. Amen!

288
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:45,255
Steph, honey.
Do not force me to interfere in your life.

289
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:47,090
I apologize.

290
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:51,261
Oona. Thank you to keep
head high, it is very nice.

291
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,889
We have to wait for the next
try, right?

292
00:16:57,267 --> 00:17:01,062
Now the programmer Ron
is in the living room for an hour!

293
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,522
- Jesse!
- Yeah?

294
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,733
Excellent.
Everyone in the room, quick!

295
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,818
Hi. So, are you excited?

296
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,738
- Oona, do not do your heavy.
- What? I'm happy for him.

297
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:19,956
Jesse Aaron Depaul, you
the legal age to use the timer.

298
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:23,752
This is to say, the first month of your entry
in high school, my boy.

299
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,422
Are you ready, my darling?

300
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,673
Fingers in the nose, Jess.

301
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,092
Do not worry. You might get more teeth
before

302
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,302
you find one that will beep.

303
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:33,261
Or that!

304
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,680
I'm not gay, Mom.
Are we could finish?

305
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:37,265
Jess.

306
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,809
I will create a set dentures,
if necessary.

307
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,895
But know that whatever happens,

308
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:45,523
'll Find someone out there who will love you
much as we love you.

309
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,195
Deep breath, dear.

310
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,260
Only three days?

311
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:15,970
What a bastard!

312
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,099
Excuse me.

313
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,477
Three days, Paul.

314
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:26,397
I admit that it is unusually fast
, but...

315
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,775
- It's better than nothing, right?
- Tell that to my sister.

316
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,110
Moron.

317
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,445
It finally has
chances of having grandchildren!

318
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,531
Less strong,
my ovaries hear you!

319
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,324
Upon entering high school!
That's my boy!

320
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:37,158
Oona.

321
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:40,286
You know what.
I'll go, I think.

322
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,832
Oona, you must find it
so unfair.

323
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,333
She told me to Brian.

324
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,585
That's nice, Paul. It's okay, Mom.

325
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:50,088
No! You emmèneras me nowhere.
You stay here.

326
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:52,006
I want to sleep tonight.

327
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:53,049
Congratulations.

328
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:54,884
Bye bye.

329
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,232
This is not true.

330
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:07,457
At what time you finish?

331
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:09,667
What?

332
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,169
You really want me to repeat?

333
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,504
Yeah, into the microphone,
if you do not mind.

334
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,466
Believe me when I say that
it'll be your only chance.

335
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:17,926
So answer me quickly.

336
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,469
Now. I just finished.

337
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,721
Nelson!
Be nice, take my place.

338
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:23,932
You're sucks, dude.

339
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:39,530
So, what are you doing?

340
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,491
Orthodontist.

341
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,409
This is a kind of dentist?

342
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,161
This is it.

343
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:47,705
I'm just orthodontist.

344
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:49,332
Sounds cool.

345
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:54,921
What's your name?

346
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,303
Uh... In fact, I have roommates.

347
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,098
How?

348
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,850
Four.
But they came out, normally.

349
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:19,988
Guys, and your manners?

350
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,990
Oona I present to you all.

351
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:25,493
And this is TJ Zuckerman, the weakling

352
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,496
on the chair,
is Greggy, and it is Wretch.

353
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,040
Uma like Uma Thurman?

354
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,587
That's right, yes.
Wretch, is not it?

355
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,177
We go to my room, it is
around the corner there. Just after.

356
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,847
I beg you. What?

357
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:49,017
Who is this chick?

358
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,324
Is that you could avoid
to tell me your age?

359
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:05,283
It would suit me.

360
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:06,701
OK.

361
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:08,202
How old are you, you?

362
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,039
I'll be thirty in January.

363
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:18,212
This might be a bad idea.

364
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:23,217
No! This is a great idea.
There is this kind of...

365
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,846
Uncontrolled attraction
raw desire,...

366
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,140
Everything that you want, it's really...

367
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,060
Really a great idea,
I swear.

368
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,120
You've got four months.

369
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,164
Yeah, but then you see...

370
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:57,418
This is four... many months.

371
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,092
Enjoy your time well.

372
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:05,343
What?

373
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,428
Yes, I'll just... Agree?

374
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,389
- No, no. Rest.
- No, I have...

375
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,391
- Really. Hello.
- No, but... Come back, please.

376
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:13,518
It is... Kiss sup...

377
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:35,748
Who are you?

378
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:36,999
I'm him.

379
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:42,296
You know what they say:
Everything comes to...

380
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:20,042
<i> All residents. The raffle... </i>

381
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:30,803
- I'm fine.
- I said nothing!

382
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,306
Margaret? It's you, Margaret?

383
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:34,849
Still missed, Sadie.

384
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:36,267
Oh, forgive me.

385
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:39,645
So? How do you feel?

386
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:41,189
I'm fine, I tell you.

387
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:43,900
Mom got me an appointment for tomorrow
evening.

388
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:45,359
The little son of someone.

389
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:46,777
Your mother is a real steamroller.

390
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:49,155
Margaret!
Answer your mother, Margaret.

391
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:50,823
I'm still your girl!
It returns?

392
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,200
- Forgive me.
- Okay.

393
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:53,910
I too undermined Jesse?

394
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,913
<i> No! Good old Ron </i>
<i> is responsible for you </i>

395
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:02,084
Romeo and Juliet were fourteen when they are loved.

396
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:04,337
You just remembered a guy
camp theater.

397
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:06,631
Margaret. It's you, Margaret?

398
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:08,382
Wait.

399
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:12,178
Yeah that's me, Mom.

400
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:13,638
And I have something to tell you.

401
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,056
I'm gay.

402
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,016
- You're...
- Gay!

403
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,018
Gay to your fingertips.

404
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:22,605
dyke to death.
In addition, my girlfriend...

405
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:24,440
This is a black.

406
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,527
It is not funny.

407
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:30,571
J'te recalls.

408
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,117
- Well... if it was funny.
- Miss Depaul.

409
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,495
You still think you have eternity before you
,

410
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,164
but it will soon be your turn to be in his place.

411
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:42,333
Come, dear lady.

412
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,420
Your room is there.

413
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:55,221
In the army, we had a nickname
for such individuals.

414
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:57,431
- You little asshole?
- Big pine oyster.

415
00:25:57,682 --> 00:25:59,433
Yours is better that going?

416
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,228
The severity lengthens.
Look rather in the air, honey.

417
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:07,483
Welcome, Mr. Evers.

418
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,111
First visit.

419
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:11,654
A little freshness.

420
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,365
Tell me, how did you find us
...

421
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:19,245
There are not many orthodontists who
your name.

422
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:23,749
You'll think to thank my father. Cindy
you can give us a moment?

423
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:25,418
In addition, Cindy.

424
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,796
I think I need rings.

425
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:31,173
But it's not me an expert, so take a look
.

426
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,093
This is... Look, I...

427
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:35,970
Come on, do not you think I'm cute in
bib?

428
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:38,848
You can not stay, OK?
That's my job here, you can not...

429
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:40,057
Look, I'm sorry.

430
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:42,268
I did not want to freak you, it was just...

431
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:44,020
I think you're really cool and...

432
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:45,980
We should go out together.

433
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:52,361
Mickey, I...

434
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,279
I'm just a cashier.

435
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:54,864
- No! That's not why.
- Good.

436
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,659
I am a musician.
And I really love my job.

437
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,828
The problem is my timer?

438
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,122
Yes, it is.

439
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,499
Do you think I'm wrong someone
I have ever met.

440
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:10,755
No, I just think that if your
countdown is launched

441
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:13,299
if you have the chance to wait for your real great...

442
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,260
Love. Say, I'm not mock.

443
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:20,097
This is it. You know it exists, then wait for the
.

444
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,768
This is what sucks with Timer

445
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,562
you have more than one way to go and you do not
turns.

446
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:28,272
But life is full of detours.

447
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,524
Do you hear what you're saying?
Looks like you sell shoes.

448
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,902
I expect great love.
And you're not the man.

449
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:38,032
Got it.

450
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:04,350
This is supposed to beep or flash.

451
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:06,602
Bipper and flash.

452
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,735
And why you've never installed
Timer?

453
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:19,115
Love has never been a priority for me
.

454
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:27,707
Are you sure it works?

455
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,486
It was as magical as in your dreams?

456
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,741
I guess there is not always
chemistry the first time.

457
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:04,285
Feelings can be installed later.

458
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,495
This is clear!
The passion that never lasts,

459
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,748
so much
find a guy who has nothing to say to you.

460
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:10,249
Thank you.

461
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:11,500
Swallow it. I'll be right there.

462
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,253
It is the Truckbeef.
Thank you for coming.

463
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,297
This is our last song.
It is called:

464
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:19,508
Mom, call me.
I do not know what to do with the body.

465
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:21,195
- Close the door.
- What?

466
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:22,822
- Close the door.
- Oh, yeah.

467
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,658
Do not worry, others are
the bar for a moment.

468
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:26,909
They flirt groupies.

469
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,582
I think it's cute that you play together.

470
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:37,378
When I was little,
the Bangles had separated.

471
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:40,214
I imagined in their loft

472
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:42,466
train ride their sleeping bags

473
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:44,176
store their makeup...

474
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,219
I like you too!

475
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:48,472
And leave their apartment where they have known

476
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:50,432
a fantastic time.

477
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:52,810
Who were these guys?

478
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:11,787
- I can be very wild.
- I love it.

479
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,582
No, no! It is silk.

480
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:16,000
I'll do it.

481
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:18,878
Too bad. Let's be crazy.

482
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:24,133
Go.

483
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:31,682
Hey, Mikey!

484
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,267
- Oh yes, Mikey, come on!
- I gotta go to the bathroom!

485
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:34,685
I hate my friends!

486
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:36,729
They can not live without me?

487
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,898
Wait. Well, uh...

488
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,233
Eat cereals,
I'll be right back.

489
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:43,569
This was our worst gig.

490
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:45,362
Frankly, it was lame.

491
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:46,780
You'll shut your mouths!

492
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:51,327
Listen. I am very serious.

493
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:53,537
This girl here...

494
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:56,707
It not play at all in my class
and I do not even know how

495
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:57,791
I brought here.

496
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,126
Petite chick.

497
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:02,588
If I'm a chick, so I'm going to
the lesbian relationship

498
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:04,256
most exciting of my life!

499
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,216
So I'm asking you to
not all fuck me in the air.

500
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:22,232
Hi.

501
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:24,818
Hi.

502
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,440
Samuel? It is you, Samuel?

503
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:05,734
Uh... Not.

504
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,779
Samuel
your children do not come to much.

505
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,572
And Margaret is impossible!

506
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,075
I think you take me for someone else
.

507
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:14,284
I miss you a lot.

508
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:18,080
I do not sleep
when you're not in our bed.

509
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:21,750
Uh... Neither do I.

510
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:25,796
Sadie, I'm willing to bet that it
is not Margaret.

511
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:29,758
Sorry,
our youth are a little unruly.

512
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,594
Can I help you?

513
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:35,180
Uh... I just see Dutch Solomon.

514
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:37,141
Oh, it must surely snooze.

515
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,518
So?
You have what region?

516
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:41,145
Rhodes Island.

517
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,063
I work at the university.

518
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:46,442
I love how you say it.
As if there was only one in town.

519
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:48,569
Vire your legs my little son.

520
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,738
You do not want me to get married, Grandpa?

521
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,282
He ​​came to support his grandfather,

522
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:54,950
not to dredge the maid.

523
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:56,535
He does what he wants his day.

524
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,663
- What's your first name?
- Uh, Dan.

525
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,416
Superdan . Me is Steph.

526
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:03,792
Enchanted, Steph.

527
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:08,922
No Timer. Damage.

528
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,009
My angel, had it been for you,
I would have told you.

529
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:13,635
I know your kind of man.

530
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,097
Come on, Daniel. This game of scrabble
will not be alone.

531
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:20,017
- I'm glad to have known her.
- The feeling is mutual.

532
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:45,417
Ah, you're awake.

533
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,252
Dirty junk.

534
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,880
So, you tell me
what you did last night?

535
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,597
Oh, my god!

536
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,433
Tell me what you did or
I piss you in your bed!

537
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:07,856
I met a guy.

538
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:09,942
Timer?

539
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,111
How long?

540
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:14,696
Three months. And wheelbarrows.

541
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:16,198
Too Sexy!

542
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:17,950
More D-Day approaches

543
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:20,160
and they want
to you like beasts.

544
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:23,288
It was great. It was more than that,

545
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,124
It was more than that, it was too
incredibly giant!

546
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:27,042
If you knew, as he kisses...

547
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:32,506
Uh... I do not know.
And he has great hands!

548
00:35:32,673 --> 00:35:34,258
I am very proud of you.

549
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:38,262
Seriously, Oona.
You're finally exploded for real.

550
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:40,639
I told you, the one-night,
there is never better.

551
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:45,477
I do not know if I'll put it away in the workbook
"no tomorrow."

552
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:49,148
You do not intend to review
this guy, right?

553
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:52,860
Oona?

554
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:56,530
Even if it does nothing dramatic
your Timers are not in phase,

555
00:35:56,697 --> 00:36:00,325
it has no intention of replaying this scene with you
. It will remind you more.

556
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:07,040
But! You took your foot.
Right?

557
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:10,085
Yes, it was really great.

558
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:14,631
Super... You want pancakes
shaped cat?

559
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:18,510
You've seen me refuse
pancakes shaped cat?

560
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:20,762
- Ten.
- Ten.

561
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:21,763
- Nine.
- Nine.

562
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:22,764
- Eight.
- Eight.

563
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:23,932
- Sept.
- Sept.

564
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,267
- Six.
- Six. Account with us, Jesse.

565
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:26,185
- Five.
- Five.

566
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:27,269
- Four.
- Four.

567
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:28,395
- Three.
- Three.

568
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:29,563
- Two.
- Two.

569
00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:30,689
-
One - One

570
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:31,857
Midnight!

571
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:37,029
The next time you hear the sound
is when you will meet

572
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:38,071
the look of your wife.

573
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,156
But it sound louder.

574
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:41,742
I, it had freaked me out.
So be ready.

575
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,994
- I can get into my room?
- Are you kidding?

576
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:46,121
How do you want to sleep?

577
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:48,415
It's more exciting than Christmas Eve!

578
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:51,501
At any time
in the next twenty-four hours

579
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:56,256
You will meet that girl
you will spend the rest of your entire life!

580
00:36:57,341 --> 00:36:58,091
Yeah.

581
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:28,288
<i> Tremble for you. Steph </i>

582
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:33,752
<i> With his large hands, heated </i>
<i> teacup Madeleine, </i>

583
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,754
<i> Mowgli clasped her hips. </i>

584
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,506
<i> His shyness vanished </i>

585
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:41,176
<i> "Mowgli, missionary work </i>
<i> is much harder than I imagined . "</i>

586
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:44,012
<i> She soon discovered </i>
<i> that was not it hard... </i>

587
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,764
Thanks! No crap.

588
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,934
Oona? How did you get Guy?

589
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:51,853
It's nice.

590
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,439
But that's about it.

591
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:57,109
You have to wait to do it install a timer.

592
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:59,611
Go to the end of things, darling.

593
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:00,654
Yes, Mom.

594
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,739
Girls,
you do not realize how lucky you.

595
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:06,660
Your generation will never know
carnage of divorce.

596
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:09,579
The sentences heart inconsolable.

597
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:12,332
The discomfort when
feelings are not reciprocated.

598
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:16,128
The humiliations. And I'm not talking about
possible venereal diseases

599
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:18,171
caused by occasional intimacies.

600
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:20,966
It was a living hell before.

601
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:22,301
A real butcher.

602
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:25,429
We had a crazy chance

603
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:28,890
despite the death of your mother, Steph,
and my disastrous marriage.

604
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:30,475
Paul and I found ourselves.

605
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,686
Now
we have a perfect family.

606
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:34,354
- Perfect.
- Perfecto.

607
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:37,107
And you are not thrilled to be
become sisters, both?

608
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:38,775
-
Si - Si

609
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:41,028
And we all need to Timer.

610
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:49,286
Jesse!

611
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,414
Jesse! That's it?

612
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:55,292
- I must go.
- Hi. See you tomorrow.

613
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:58,003
Super Marion.

614
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,505
Now, you're just removing him
chocolate on her cheek with your saliva.

615
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,343
This is not it.

616
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:07,637
So what?

617
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:10,223
Is it a paged?

618
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:12,642
No.

619
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:31,536
What does it hurt to invite girls
Sheila to eat pizza?

620
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,790
Cool, dinner
forced and arranged marriages.

621
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:37,417
This is not your role to act as matchmaker
.

622
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:38,835
Luz! You're leaving?

623
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:40,712
If Madame Marion, me voy.

624
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,589
Hey, Eduardo.

625
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,008
Oh, it's your daughter?

626
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:46,218
Si Es mi hija.

627
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:47,844
Soledad ! Por favor.

628
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:52,099
The Saluda.

629
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:55,102
Hello Ms. Depaul. I Soledad.
Nice to meet you.

630
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:57,437
What beautiful daughter, Luz.

631
00:39:57,604 --> 00:40:00,357
This is my daughter, Oona.
My daughter, Steph.

632
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:01,858
And here Jesse.

633
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:16,081
Slim, then!

634
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,918
Eduardo!

635
00:40:24,548 --> 00:40:26,508
This is just fantastic!

636
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,552
Is it not fantastic, Jesse?

637
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:29,928
Is!

638
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:31,763
Hi.

639
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,099
What paso?

640
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:35,475
Sono la cosa.

641
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:36,977
- Con el?
- Ya el sound Timer.

642
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:39,104
- Esta luz segura that...
- Y la luz parpadea.

643
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:41,064
Mom, why not invite them to join
a drink?

644
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:43,483
Great idea! Please.

645
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,736
Dice that tenemos una sanilla in the Mostar.

646
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:49,239
Sorry, Ms. Depaul
but we have a dinner.

647
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:50,740
But you dine with us!

648
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,785
. No, this is a
dinner in my honor.

649
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:56,371
With the neighborhood boys.

650
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:58,790
Well, it is no longer useful,
must say.

651
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,502
Sorry, but we have to go.
Thanks.

652
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,681
This is not what I call
of politeness.

653
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:16,850
That's family.

654
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:18,977
They are in shock.

655
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:22,397
And so are we, Mom.
You can not blame them.

656
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:26,318
My darling.
It looks really nice.

657
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:27,694
And super great.

658
00:41:31,573 --> 00:41:32,365
Marion.

659
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:34,326
Leave him a little.

660
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:37,787
This is a little hard for him,
mom, you know.

661
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:41,625
He has not a hair on his chin and
he was presented with the woman of his life.

662
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,211
He has no idea of ​​what
love.

663
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:45,712
You know, do you?

664
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:49,299
And here.

665
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:51,176
On some subjects,

666
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:53,428
best placed to talk about it.

667
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,139
I love when she leaves her little claws.

668
00:41:58,058 --> 00:42:00,810
Say, do not you think it odd that is never

669
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:02,687
fell in love?

670
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:04,606
No.

671
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:06,816
It happens once, then
is good.

672
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:11,363
Yes. But, do you think they thought
like this before?

673
00:42:11,655 --> 00:42:13,698
What it does happen once.
Finally, before the timer?

674
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:15,951
I think the expression

675
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:19,162
"true love"
necessarily imply that there is smaller.

676
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,666
Here you will not address
to the right person.

677
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,168
Thanks for the help.

678
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:35,136
- Good night, Cindy.
- Good night.

679
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:42,853
You bastard!

680
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:44,479
Wanna blow up my nose, or what?

681
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:47,274
Why are you here?
What are you doing here?

682
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,900
I just wanted to see you.

683
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:52,112
Why?

684
00:42:57,951 --> 00:42:59,160
You're a real denture adhesive.

685
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:08,712
Just give me a minute.

686
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:43,496
- She's out.
- Uh, who?

687
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:46,041
My sister Steph.
We live together.

688
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,375
And you not like?

689
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,419
Oh yes, yes. It is very girlfriends.

690
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:51,046
This is it?

691
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:54,841
Oh, you're twins?

692
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,344
No. In fact, it is my half-sister

693
00:43:57,636 --> 00:43:59,512
but still our birthday party together.

694
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:02,641
Every year, mom
organizes a surprise party.

695
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:05,769
This is a surprise for you
every year?

696
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:06,936
Oh, I like.

697
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:09,773
Nice.

698
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:14,194
Okay, I see. Say, uh...

699
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,988
How long will it last?

700
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:20,325
As long as you let me kiss you.

701
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:24,746
Look, I...

702
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:30,877
I have not used.
I slept with four men in my life

703
00:44:31,044 --> 00:44:33,296
and each time, I was afraid

704
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:36,216
to face the possibility of losing.

705
00:44:36,383 --> 00:44:39,969
And with you, it is
that is not even a possibility.

706
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:41,513
This is absolutely sure.

707
00:44:43,682 --> 00:44:45,016
So, you're a free spirit.

708
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,064
Wait a second. You say I'm your
"Mambo number five?"

709
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:53,858
You want to dance?

710
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:56,945
Yes...

711
00:44:58,738 --> 00:44:59,823
- Yes?
- Yes.

712
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:00,573
Yes?

713
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:03,118
- Yes!
- Yes?

714
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:05,203
Kiss me.

715
00:45:11,543 --> 00:45:13,128
- It's gone.
- OK.

716
00:45:58,298 --> 00:46:00,675
My mother had her own
when she was still married to my father.

717
00:46:01,593 --> 00:46:03,803
This became irrefutable proof
they were divorced.

718
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:05,638
You can still see your father?

719
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:08,224
Not since my childhood.

720
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:10,977
This is a music producer and good...

721
00:46:11,895 --> 00:46:14,439
Had not much in common.

722
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:17,025
Wait. You're kidding me?

723
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:20,820
Your father is Rick O'Leary?

724
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:22,614
Yes.

725
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:27,911
Is that okay?

726
00:46:28,745 --> 00:46:30,246
You're kidding! It is a legend!

727
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,748
This is what I was told.

728
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,003
I slept with the girl
Rick O'Leary.

729
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:41,007
I'm too cool as dude.

730
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:43,259
I could have sworn that you had that defect.

731
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:44,928
Vilaine!

732
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:47,722
Your parents are together?

733
00:46:48,223 --> 00:46:50,975
Yeah.
They met the old.

734
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:54,562
They had four beautiful boys with me
the youngest and most beautiful.

735
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:57,482
Your brothers have timers or not?

736
00:46:58,024 --> 00:46:59,192
Why do you want a date?

737
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,653
A girl, it should look, it can not just

738
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:05,949
bathing
and cry over the fate of the Timer.

739
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,451
You do not have to thy sister,
you're lucky.

740
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:10,537
Yes, you're right.

741
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,331
But, in a sense know

742
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:16,543
is always better than not knowing. Although

743
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:21,714
knowledge can be terribly confusing.
At least she lives her life.

744
00:47:22,257 --> 00:47:24,884
It can build its future.
Make big plans.

745
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:26,761
This is how she lives?

746
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:30,598
No.

747
00:47:33,268 --> 00:47:35,812
No. It takes a little mystery in life
.

748
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:40,233
Really?

749
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:43,611
If this is your philosophy,
why you have a timer?

750
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,198
This was to be like the others.

751
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:50,076
Why are you on the other side of the bed?

752
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:54,873
I do not know.

753
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:56,916
- I see why you do not know.
- You idiot.

754
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,501
- You're the idiot.
- You're an idiot.

755
00:47:58,668 --> 00:47:59,711
- No, it's you.
- Idiot.

756
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:00,837
- You, idiot.
- Shut up.

757
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:02,589
- You farm.
- Shut up.

758
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:12,974
Miss Depaul.
Where were you there an hour?

759
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:16,394
Right there. Faithful to the post.
A smile on my face.

760
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:20,148
Why
Ms. Kauffman fell on the answering machine three times?

761
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:23,401
You trust a nasty reporter?

762
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:25,111
You're not paid to walk
,

763
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:26,988
but to sit behind the counter.

764
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,742
Sorry to interrupt.
But it's my fault.

765
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:35,788
When I arrived this morning

766
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:37,790
I forgot where
room of my grandfather and was

767
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:39,375
I asked him to accompany me.

768
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:40,585
Really?

769
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,046
- Yes.
- Who is your grandfather?

770
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:44,255
Dutch Solomon.

771
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:48,384
<i> Doctor Rosen, contact the lab </i>.

772
00:48:48,885 --> 00:48:49,886
Apologize.

773
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:58,394
You did not have.

774
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:00,021
I apologize.

775
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:03,107
I wanted to avoid unnecessary remonstrances.

776
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,859
This was totally unnecessary.

777
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:07,612
I spent an hour sipping
frapuccino a local bar.

778
00:49:08,488 --> 00:49:10,239
OK, so I remember?

779
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:12,033
If you want, we told him the truth.
It will do me good.

780
00:49:14,494 --> 00:49:17,080
No, I do not want to have
a good influence on you.

781
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:21,501
Do you know
Pocket Watch?

782
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,097
You go to the bar tonight?

783
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,599
Uh... Why not.

784
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:38,518
I do not know, why?

785
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:40,895
Because it's been a while you're at
not go.

786
00:49:41,229 --> 00:49:44,023
And because I found you a new little toy
without timer.

787
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:46,901
White teeth.
Exceptionally naive.

788
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:49,487
No scars and no visible tattoos.

789
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:53,074
Uh...  Okay. Okay, okay, I...

790
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:54,492
I'll jump.

791
00:49:58,121 --> 00:49:58,871
What?

792
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:00,999
- Why are you weird?
- It is you who are weird!

793
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:28,735
Technical Jolie.

794
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:30,611
Yeah. Nice Suit, James Bond.

795
00:50:34,157 --> 00:50:35,158
Dutch insisted.

796
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:37,702
This is always a good idea

797
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:40,079
take fashion advice
an octogenarian.

798
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:41,664
What are you drinking?

799
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:44,375
I'm afraid to order now.

800
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:47,545
I promise not to laugh at you.

801
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:50,923
Bring me what you want.

802
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:55,845
My sister will go in a minute. Is it good?

803
00:50:58,097 --> 00:50:59,057
No problem.

804
00:51:03,144 --> 00:51:05,396
Oona.
You have perfect teeth.

805
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:07,398
- I know.
- You...

806
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:09,067
Femur very very white.

807
00:51:09,484 --> 00:51:13,071
And your tricomachin
is simply superb.

808
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:14,030
Should aspire.

809
00:51:14,197 --> 00:51:15,573
- Oh. Aspiration.
- Go ahead.

810
00:51:16,908 --> 00:51:19,243
OK, now...
Oops, sorry. I think

811
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,496
I sucked you a tonsil.
I am going to place.

812
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:26,876
No response.

813
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:29,837
She better be
crushed under a truck.

814
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:33,883
This was an appointment?

815
00:51:34,217 --> 00:51:35,843
Your sister has a blank timer.

816
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:38,012
Nothing can hide you, James.

817
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:40,473
In any case, that's nice. Thank you.

818
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,936
I'm sure your sister is nice,
but I'm not looking

819
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:46,896
of anything.

820
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:49,649
How can want nothing at all?

821
00:51:54,654 --> 00:51:56,030
I was married.

822
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:58,491
And my wife is dead. So...

823
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:00,701
Sorry.

824
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:04,580
No, no, wait. That's why I
tell anyone.

825
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:07,625
You're the girl most impertinent
I met.

826
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:10,753
And then you just be nice
and condescending with me.

827
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:16,092
In fact, You wanna forget.

828
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:17,260
What?

829
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:19,011
I'm sorry. I have not...

830
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:21,180
- It's okay, it's okay.
- No it would kill me there.

831
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:24,517
This is not... In your place,
I would not know what to say either.

832
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:30,064
So, it's been how long?

833
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,692
Three years already. In December.

834
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:35,528
How was it?

835
00:52:37,196 --> 00:52:38,489
She was very beautiful.

836
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,075
But quite disturbed.

837
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:45,288
It is as if waiting for something bad from happening
, permanently.

838
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:48,374
And he finally arrived.

839
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:51,586
This was your great love?

840
00:52:53,588 --> 00:52:54,547
Yes, she was.

841
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:58,426
- You knew without Timer?
- Obviously.

842
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:03,431
Yes, I see it.

843
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:06,893
Was even more!

844
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:08,895
Excellent evening.

845
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:14,525
I love this job.

846
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:16,402
You can see it, yes.

847
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:20,364
And there's something else
that interest you?

848
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:23,951
Apart serve and answer the phone?

849
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:25,578
Why do anything else?

850
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:28,831
Oh. But that's how it works
here, right? Waitresses

851
00:53:28,998 --> 00:53:32,627
are actresses.
The guys who are writers deliver you...

852
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:35,755
Good. The naked truth:

853
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:38,174
I work in a bar
order to meet guys

854
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:41,802
and I take care of the old
because they have no timer.

855
00:53:43,054 --> 00:53:44,597
I bet you do it
for something else.

856
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:47,683
- Yeah, I like to pass...
- No, listen,

857
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:50,186
do not answer,
if your answer is not sincere.

858
00:53:57,944 --> 00:53:58,986
Standing, wimp!

859
00:54:01,197 --> 00:54:02,281
Who raised you?

860
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:04,617
When we say we do
something, we do it!

861
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:07,161
What there was, Steph?
Damn!

862
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:08,537
This is not so dramatic.

863
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:11,374
Oh if it's a drama!
You just missed a rather attractive man,

864
00:54:11,499 --> 00:54:14,669
terribly nice, with a big heart
bleeding like that

865
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,420
and desperately seeking true love.

866
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:18,631
A bit like you, Tartouille!

867
00:54:21,217 --> 00:54:22,510
- You're naked?
- Me? No!

868
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:24,303
I have a robe.

869
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,305
But you're naked underneath.
You never sleep naked.

870
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:28,099
- Sometimes it happens.
- No! Never.

871
00:54:28,266 --> 00:54:29,850
You're too scared to try burglars.

872
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:31,602
- Who's there?
- No!

873
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:33,312
There is no one!

874
00:54:35,398 --> 00:54:36,899
Since when did you lie to me?

875
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,697
I'm Mikey. You is Steph?

876
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:45,574
You not tired. Uh...

877
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:48,744
This gentleman is three months
right?

878
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:55,126
Yes . One month and twelve days,
yes, it's him.

879
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:58,296
Oona. What are you doing?

880
00:55:00,006 --> 00:55:02,550
- You were together all this time?
- Yes! Indeed.

881
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,344
And everything goes well.
I control the situation.

882
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:06,804
- Thou controls?
- If I...

883
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:08,514
You thickets finger in the eye, my old
.

884
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:11,726
Why? Because I'm happy
spending quality time with him?

885
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:13,936
Because I'm not a real slave
Timer?

886
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:17,189
No! But because it will break your heart in the
billion pieces!

887
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:18,691
- I think...
- I know all about self-destruction

888
00:55:18,858 --> 00:55:19,859
- and it is!
- I think...

889
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:21,569
- Maybe we could...
- Spit your piece, Sparky!

890
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,571
- Mikey.
- What's the difference?

891
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,197
My Timer.

892
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:26,574
What did he?

893
00:55:28,284 --> 00:55:29,410
Oh my god!

894
00:55:29,577 --> 00:55:31,746
Girls, calm.
What's up, it's a fake.

895
00:55:32,455 --> 00:55:34,749
Look, it sticks.

896
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:39,628
This is a fake?

897
00:55:40,629 --> 00:55:42,965
You...  You have no countdown?

898
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:46,093
You got no timer at all?

899
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,595
No, I have not.

900
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:53,517
- Are you kidding me?
- No wait, I'll explain.

901
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:56,187
- I beg you. Explains.
- Yeah, okay, uh...

902
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:59,648
Wretch found it on the internet,
someday.

903
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:03,027
You program the date you want.
And everyone was obsessed with this stuff,

904
00:56:03,194 --> 00:56:06,364
so I bought here...
I had more pressure not have.

905
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:09,492
If I dig it, you use it as a false alliance
pick up girls.

906
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:11,786
This is smart enough, I admit. Sorry.

907
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:15,539
No. I mean yes,
they sell for.

908
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,876
But I just wanted a chance
whether the person like me

909
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:20,711
and if it is reciprocal.

910
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,297
It is you who have said.
You're different with guys without Timer.

911
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:25,466
But do not want you to know that
for real?

912
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:30,388
Yes, but now I know you're lying
me for months.

913
00:56:37,103 --> 00:56:38,479
I did not want to meet you like this.

914
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,149
You mean underpants?

915
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:44,360
With this timer.

916
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:47,530
Here. Thank you.

917
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:49,657
Nice knowing you.

918
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:51,075
You want to make another break?

919
00:56:51,242 --> 00:56:53,411
No.
I want you to leave my house.

920
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,497
Okay. Super.

921
00:56:57,498 --> 00:56:59,208
If you understand that you make a mistake,

922
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:02,753
the fact that I do not have
Timer is a good thing,

923
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:03,963
call me.

924
00:58:14,033 --> 00:58:14,617
Hi.

925
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:16,535
'Read.

926
00:58:18,204 --> 00:58:20,664
I have no reason to apologize, but
I apologize.

927
00:58:23,292 --> 00:58:24,627
This is an excuse just forced it.

928
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:27,087
This is true.

929
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:30,591
It is you who should apologize.

930
00:58:32,343 --> 00:58:33,135
I know.

931
00:58:33,928 --> 00:58:35,012
I should have told you.

932
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,224
You should have, indeed.

933
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:39,808
This is what I just said.

934
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:41,352
I know.

935
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:45,856
- You came to me to destroy the moral?
- No.

936
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:53,822
I thought maybe we could
out a little more.

937
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:58,327
From Monday, obviously.

938
00:59:00,913 --> 00:59:02,164
It depends, actually.

939
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:05,125
What?

940
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:08,212
What you got this weekend?

941
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:10,506
Thanksgiving.

942
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:13,008
Ah, that's true.

943
00:59:15,261 --> 00:59:16,595
You do not have a project?

944
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:20,808
Good. Then.

945
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:24,436
My mother is a little crazy.
But absolutely adorable.

946
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:27,022
My stepfather Paul himself is
much more sane.

947
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:28,232
This is it you speak.

948
00:59:28,649 --> 00:59:29,608
Got a tire-swing!

949
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:32,111
Oh! My brother Jesse.
A golden boy.

950
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:34,780
And his soul mate and his family will be there
.

951
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:36,699
It is very stressed,
therefore not angry.

952
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:39,910
And you already know Steph.
So you know if it shows teeth

953
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:41,662
hide yourself under the table. Ready?

954
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:46,250
Hi!

955
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:48,085
Do not move. Sorry.

956
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:51,839
J'te this mother.
Marion Depaul.

957
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:54,925
This is my stepfather, Paul.

958
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:57,720
You know my sister, Steph.

959
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:01,557
And here's Jesse, Soledad
and Mr. and Mrs. Morales.

960
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:04,560
Good evening. Mikey.

961
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:06,562
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

962
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:09,648
I present Michael Evers.

963
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:11,942
Well, we are delighted to welcome you
.

964
01:00:12,693 --> 01:00:15,154
Paul is to mix the guacamole.

965
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,205
- It looks delicious.
- Great.

966
01:00:25,372 --> 01:00:28,167
I think
qu'Oona had to announce the good news.

967
01:00:28,334 --> 01:00:29,710
Soledad will be part of the family.

968
01:00:29,877 --> 01:00:32,963
Oh yes, I learned it. Congratulations
. Felicidades.

969
01:00:33,714 --> 01:00:34,715
Gracias.

970
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:37,051
Uh... Margarita, Mikey?

971
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,928
Your identity card, Sparky.

972
01:00:40,429 --> 01:00:43,766
If you allow me, I'll stick to water, but
thank you sir.

973
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:45,517
What a joy to see you, Steph.

974
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:48,187
Me, I will. Thank you.

975
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:53,108
I propose a toast.

976
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:56,654
To our families who make more than one.

977
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:02,326
Health.

978
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:06,372
So Oona. You did not tell me much about Michael
.

979
01:01:06,664 --> 01:01:08,415
- How did you meet?
- Thank you.

980
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:12,795
Mikey musician.
I met him at a concert.

981
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:14,713
- You play what instrument?
- Is the drummer.

982
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:17,341
His band was a huge success.

983
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:21,595
What's his name your band again?

984
01:01:21,762 --> 01:01:22,471
Truckbeef.

985
01:01:23,097 --> 01:01:24,139
Large dung?

986
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:25,432
Truckbeef!

987
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:27,101
You know?

988
01:01:27,643 --> 01:01:29,520
I know that "love is a beautiful mess."

989
01:01:29,687 --> 01:01:31,021
This is your first single,
is not it?

990
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:33,982
Yeah. While there, you amaze me.

991
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:39,321
Tell me, Michael.
Where are you from?

992
01:01:39,488 --> 01:01:40,531
Excuse me.

993
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:42,533
Kalamazoo, Michigan. For real.

994
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:45,953
Is that why
you do not have a timer?

995
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:48,956
Indeed.
And also because I do not believe it.

996
01:01:58,549 --> 01:02:00,134
Quieres a burrito, Mikey?

997
01:02:00,801 --> 01:02:02,177
Oh, yes. Por supuesto.

998
01:02:12,438 --> 01:02:14,648
It went well.
It went well, eh?

999
01:02:15,107 --> 01:02:18,110
- I think it went well.
- It went well. Okay?

1000
01:02:19,153 --> 01:02:20,028
Sure, why?

1001
01:02:20,571 --> 01:02:22,364
You look a little tense air
that's all.

1002
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:23,741
All is well.

1003
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:08,619
This is supposed to beep or flash?

1004
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:09,536
Both.

1005
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:19,421
Does
you can remember why you've never had a timer?

1006
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:23,675
I do not know.
I have not had the opportunity.

1007
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:29,431
Really?

1008
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:35,979
At the time, I still lived in Michigan
. And ..

1009
01:03:37,064 --> 01:03:41,652
There are eight, when I was old enough to make me
install,

1010
01:03:42,194 --> 01:03:46,323
it was still scary. People were afraid.
Then all my high school had one.

1011
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,201
And I did not want to
as everyone.

1012
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:54,414
You're twenty-two years?

1013
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:58,460
Yeah. You thought I had more?

1014
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:01,797
Yes. More frankly, yes.

1015
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:08,637
Is it a paged?

1016
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:09,888
No.

1017
01:04:12,975 --> 01:04:14,184
This is a charming young man.

1018
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:16,562
Mom.

1019
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:18,856
What harm is there in that?

1020
01:04:19,273 --> 01:04:21,275
It is as if you had seen
a movie you hate,

1021
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:23,235
and thou know why

1022
01:04:23,402 --> 01:04:26,154
you've learned all the dialogues
worst scenes by heart.

1023
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:28,699
Why
do not tell me what you really think?

1024
01:04:28,866 --> 01:04:29,992
It is too young

1025
01:04:30,242 --> 01:04:32,953
there is no culture,
it is not good enough.

1026
01:04:33,662 --> 01:04:35,205
I feel that it is you who speak there.

1027
01:04:36,832 --> 01:04:40,043
The only thing that worries me
is that you're so attached to the boy.

1028
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42,212
It is you who say we go
to the bottom of things.

1029
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:45,257
I would be delighted if it had a timer.

1030
01:04:45,424 --> 01:04:48,760
If it was good,
I would love for you.

1031
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:51,680
But even if it had a timer,
I would still have doubts.

1032
01:04:52,431 --> 01:04:54,433
It reminds me of your father too.

1033
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:56,059
What it looks like him?

1034
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:57,978
This is a musician!

1035
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:03,275
This may be a bit redundant, but it
the same haunting charm a bit.

1036
01:05:03,442 --> 01:05:05,819
This species aside a little bohemian.

1037
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,448
I admit that it is very attractive.

1038
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:12,451
What kind of mother would I be if I
does not help you

1039
01:05:12,576 --> 01:05:14,494
to avoid the mistakes I made?

1040
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:17,706
If my father is a mistake, so can I. I am a
, is not it?

1041
01:05:17,873 --> 01:05:19,374
Oona. No prank.

1042
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:25,088
I know everything
you have done for me.

1043
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,466
But you can not say that Paul
is your soulmate

1044
01:05:27,633 --> 01:05:30,344
and I'm the girl of your dreams
in the same sentence.

1045
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:32,262
These are two different lives.

1046
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:36,266
I must go.

1047
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:39,937
- I thought you had dinner with us?
- No, Mikey and I are going out tonight.

1048
01:05:54,576 --> 01:05:55,494
Can I ask you something?

1049
01:05:56,912 --> 01:05:57,829
Can I say no?

1050
01:05:58,538 --> 01:05:59,206
No.

1051
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:04,294
Why there tits
that go into a spin?

1052
01:06:07,047 --> 01:06:08,131
I'm not sure I understand.

1053
01:06:09,758 --> 01:06:12,719
OK. Thy breasts to you,
they are straight, strong, sublime.

1054
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:16,723
But I'm talking about girls who have breasts
that deviate a little from the center.

1055
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:18,392
This is strange.

1056
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:21,687
As a guy who squints,
we do not know what eye look.

1057
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:27,776
Unless they are super far.
There, you think they are normal,

1058
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:29,653
but if you bifton a troubled,

1059
01:06:29,778 --> 01:06:32,531
they arrive in your eyes
and is like, "which I have to watch?"

1060
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:37,661
Sometimes I tell myself that it's girls
sleeping too much on the belly.

1061
01:06:37,828 --> 01:06:39,371
So, it departs.

1062
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:41,415
Or it may be genetic.

1063
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:43,709
The cow, if it is genetic,

1064
01:06:43,959 --> 01:06:46,420
Girls have their breasts
squarely in the back.

1065
01:06:49,965 --> 01:06:51,633
Eh. I have something for you.

1066
01:06:53,635 --> 01:06:55,137
These are our new songs.

1067
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:58,140
Y is one that is called.
"You m'fais cringe."

1068
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:00,642
- Original.
- Thank you.

1069
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:03,854
So when I see you again?

1070
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:08,108
Or to be precise, when I see him again
your pretty little firmer breasts?

1071
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,569
I do not know.
Maybe when you get matured.

1072
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:14,364
There is a problem?

1073
01:07:16,158 --> 01:07:17,325
Mikey.

1074
01:07:18,702 --> 01:07:20,662
I'll be thirty,
this weekend.

1075
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:24,833
This is your biological clock
running?

1076
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:28,879
This is what we do!
This is... I mean...

1077
01:07:29,296 --> 01:07:32,257
I do not have time for this kind of
relationship without a future.

1078
01:07:32,424 --> 01:07:35,302
Thank you for everything, making
pretend that the timer had not.

1079
01:07:35,469 --> 01:07:37,846
Really, it was great.
I have had a good time.

1080
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:40,724
But now
I know that your wrist is blank

1081
01:07:40,891 --> 01:07:42,726
I can not stop thinking about it.
It haunts me completely!

1082
01:07:43,018 --> 01:07:45,937
My virgin wrist? Damn, what are you talking about
? What is your problem?

1083
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,690
This is why I do not want a timer,
it fucks up.

1084
01:07:51,318 --> 01:07:54,738
I need to know.
I'm really tired of waiting.

1085
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:56,323
Okay. Okay.

1086
01:07:57,032 --> 01:07:58,200
If I had a timer,

1087
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:00,869
and that he would have to pass
paged our life together

1088
01:08:01,036 --> 01:08:02,204
it will suffice?

1089
01:08:03,497 --> 01:08:04,081
Yes.

1090
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:06,708
So, you're more confident
a plastic than what I'm saying?

1091
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:07,918
You say nothing, you
pissing me off!

1092
01:08:08,085 --> 01:08:09,377
If I say
I'm in love with you!

1093
01:08:14,508 --> 01:08:17,010
I do not know what it means.

1094
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:22,808
Listen, Oona.

1095
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:25,894
What are you waiting for?

1096
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:29,981
A warranty.

1097
01:08:33,652 --> 01:08:34,069
No.

1098
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:38,615
Your problem is not my warranty,
it's yours.

1099
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:48,959
Forget it.

1100
01:09:21,825 --> 01:09:22,993
I have something to do.

1101
01:09:24,161 --> 01:09:26,454
- Species of pretentious.
- I need to go see Rick.

1102
01:09:27,581 --> 01:09:28,623
Golly!

1103
01:09:28,874 --> 01:09:30,792
Uh... I ended up in twenty minutes.

1104
01:09:33,336 --> 01:09:34,462
And shit, it breaks. Come on.

1105
01:09:38,592 --> 01:09:40,844
Well, it changes the studio
where you've grown.

1106
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:42,554
That yes.

1107
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:45,515
I slept on an ironing board,
hanging from the ceiling.

1108
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,393
You think he'll recognize me?

1109
01:09:48,643 --> 01:09:50,395
Breasts were growing, we change
no brainer.

1110
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:00,697
It is the stroke of the bell,
to laugh?

1111
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:02,532
You took a bag with a turd?

1112
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:09,706
Hello!

1113
01:10:10,415 --> 01:10:11,541
Hello...

1114
01:10:11,917 --> 01:10:13,168
We came to see Rick.

1115
01:10:15,003 --> 01:10:15,795
This is for what?

1116
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:18,423
Oh, no, no.

1117
01:10:18,757 --> 01:10:20,759
No, it's not what you think.

1118
01:10:20,926 --> 01:10:23,220
No. I... Finally, I'm his daughter.

1119
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:30,310
Rick?

1120
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:33,521
These girls want to see you.

1121
01:10:38,485 --> 01:10:39,152
Hi.

1122
01:10:42,155 --> 01:10:43,240
Where is your bathroom?

1123
01:10:43,615 --> 01:10:45,325
Follow me. Forgiveness.

1124
01:10:52,207 --> 01:10:54,876
Sorry for not calling
before moving on.

1125
01:10:55,043 --> 01:10:58,004
This is not serious.
Uh, come on, sit down.

1126
01:11:01,299 --> 01:11:02,175
How are you?

1127
01:11:02,926 --> 01:11:03,677
Okay.

1128
01:11:06,554 --> 01:11:09,224
It is you seem very moved
but I have a friend...

1129
01:11:10,308 --> 01:11:13,019
I do not know if he has talent, but
play in a small group.

1130
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:15,647
And I say you could
perhaps listen to some demo's.

1131
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:16,773
Okay.

1132
01:11:17,232 --> 01:11:17,983
I will.

1133
01:11:24,572 --> 01:11:25,824
Well, you know what?

1134
01:11:26,408 --> 01:11:28,785
I do not want to waste your time

1135
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:30,787
I just wanted you to explain...

1136
01:11:31,496 --> 01:11:34,582
You
tell me why you never had Timer.

1137
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:38,295
I know it is not so much an artist
sensitive stuff

1138
01:11:38,461 --> 01:11:40,088
- and all that, but...
- I have one, Timer.

1139
01:11:42,299 --> 01:11:42,924
What?

1140
01:11:45,093 --> 01:11:46,344
When do
you did install?

1141
01:11:47,262 --> 01:11:48,972
Before you and your mother
leave home.

1142
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:55,603
- I thought you had refused.
- No.

1143
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:57,397
This was my idea.

1144
01:11:58,148 --> 01:12:01,443
I knew that there was no
future, even before you were born.

1145
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:06,239
But Marion did not want to know.

1146
01:12:07,449 --> 01:12:09,284
I told myself that if we had Timers,

1147
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:13,038
then it might open your eyes a little
.

1148
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:17,792
When did your count?

1149
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:19,085
It is white as snow.

1150
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:21,588
Can you imagine?

1151
01:12:23,757 --> 01:12:25,925
Apparently
life holds for me a surprise.

1152
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:31,389
Let's go.

1153
01:12:34,184 --> 01:12:36,186
Thank you.
Nice to meet you.

1154
01:12:41,232 --> 01:12:42,317
I did retire.

1155
01:12:42,776 --> 01:12:44,527
Your father is not my soul mate.

1156
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:46,071
But I love it.

1157
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:48,281
The devil. Who cares.

1158
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:57,499
Here we go! We could have done that
there for years!

1159
01:12:57,665 --> 01:12:58,958
This is more exciting than the day

1160
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:01,294
where
convinced Katie Meyers to shave his head.

1161
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:02,545
- Oh, yes.
- Oona?

1162
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:04,214
It was a sacred moment.

1163
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:06,841
You will definitely leave nothing to chance.

1164
01:13:07,342 --> 01:13:10,595
No. Not.
She is my sister, Steph.

1165
01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:13,556
- Nice to meet you.
- The feeling is mutual.

1166
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:15,642
We want to take our Timers.

1167
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:17,769
For real?

1168
01:13:18,645 --> 01:13:20,188
- Removed completely?
- Yes.

1169
01:13:20,772 --> 01:13:22,857
Oona, you drop?

1170
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:25,235
- No.
- She wants to take the lead.

1171
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:26,611
Finally, we want to.

1172
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:28,446
You transfer us these vampires,
yes or heck?

1173
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:31,157
I do not know.
I have never done that before.

1174
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:32,534
I'll call my boss.

1175
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:37,163
You're certain you want to make this mistake?

1176
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:39,916
- Absolutely.
- Downright!

1177
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:45,797
Note that removing the
Timer is much more painful than the establishment.

1178
01:13:45,964 --> 01:13:48,508
This is one reason why
we do not recommend it.

1179
01:13:49,676 --> 01:13:51,553
And you will have a visible scar.

1180
01:13:52,053 --> 01:13:53,972
Okay, that's cool.
We are warriors.

1181
01:13:58,309 --> 01:14:00,228
- This is a real antique, the Timer!
- The cow is a relic!

1182
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:01,438
He's too old!

1183
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:03,523
Remarks can be avoided?
Thanks.

1184
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:04,816
Sorry.

1185
01:14:08,278 --> 01:14:08,945
It's gone?

1186
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:10,655
It's been years that I expect it.

1187
01:14:11,281 --> 01:14:11,823
Let's go.

1188
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:13,366
I count to three.

1189
01:14:16,995 --> 01:14:17,579
One

1190
01:14:20,623 --> 01:14:21,249
Two.

1191
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,294
Pu... nese!

1192
01:14:27,589 --> 01:14:28,465
I swear, it's not bad.

1193
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:29,716
It shows.

1194
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:31,384
You're clueless the three?

1195
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:38,183
It's like losing ten pounds.

1196
01:14:39,184 --> 01:14:39,976
Good.

1197
01:14:40,602 --> 01:14:41,686
To you, champ.

1198
01:14:43,605 --> 01:14:45,356
Send your mother in hell!

1199
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:47,233
Good!

1200
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:49,736
Oona, do you realize

1201
01:14:49,903 --> 01:14:51,613
is irreversible when the device is removed.

1202
01:14:51,738 --> 01:14:54,157
Your sensory area is too damaged.

1203
01:14:56,034 --> 01:14:57,619
Why did they not tell me about it, me?

1204
01:14:59,287 --> 01:15:00,538
You can be more clear?

1205
01:15:00,788 --> 01:15:02,957
You can no longer do you implement
Timer.

1206
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:06,127
The other wrist does not work.
You are entitled to a chance.

1207
01:15:09,464 --> 01:15:11,049
Just... OK.

1208
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:14,219
Question.

1209
01:15:14,511 --> 01:15:16,262
You think my timer work?

1210
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:19,641
Or that it is a sort of family curse
?

1211
01:15:21,726 --> 01:15:24,896
The fate, you know...
This is a bit overrated in my opinion.

1212
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:29,692
Oona?

1213
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:34,197
We're together.

1214
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:37,575
Okay.

1215
01:15:38,117 --> 01:15:40,286
- Go. Go. We go.
- Are you sure?

1216
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:42,121
Super.

1217
01:15:43,206 --> 01:15:43,957
Three.

1218
01:15:47,835 --> 01:15:48,461
One

1219
01:15:50,505 --> 01:15:51,214
Two.

1220
01:15:56,803 --> 01:15:58,346
What... What is it?

1221
01:16:02,809 --> 01:16:04,060
What happens?

1222
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:09,065
This is crazy!

1223
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:10,817
Can know what's crazy?

1224
01:16:11,109 --> 01:16:15,738
Apparently, your soulmate
just bought a timer.

1225
01:16:17,615 --> 01:16:19,659
- The shit!
- You will meet him tomorrow!

1226
01:16:19,826 --> 01:16:23,204
No! No, no. You must have the
bypass your thing.

1227
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:24,414
This is bullshit!

1228
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:25,915
I mean, it's impossible!

1229
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:28,334
Even if this is true,
anyway, it changes nothing.

1230
01:16:29,544 --> 01:16:32,755
This is perhaps Mikey, and in this case,
you will see tomorrow, or else

1231
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:37,051
it will be someone else, but
in all cases, you will meet tomorrow.

1232
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:39,804
You'll still remove it, huh?

1233
01:16:42,056 --> 01:16:43,349
Oona? You gonna do it?

1234
01:16:46,269 --> 01:16:47,103
I do not know.

1235
01:16:48,688 --> 01:16:49,772
I know more.

1236
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:54,235
It finally happened!

1237
01:17:04,078 --> 01:17:05,246
I'll wait for you outside.

1238
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:15,214
You will not regret it.

1239
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:20,136
By cons, it is 79 dollars
for your sister.

1240
01:17:21,012 --> 01:17:22,472
This is the price manipulation '.

1241
01:18:29,372 --> 01:18:31,916
Jesse. In your post. Good evening.

1242
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:35,044
If you leave this chair, I promise

1243
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:37,296
I'll make you listen to classical music
until you die.

1244
01:18:39,841 --> 01:18:42,719
Mikey! Enter soon!
The girls arrive in a minute.

1245
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:45,430
- And thank you for coming.
- Thanks for inviting me, ma'am.

1246
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:52,019
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

1247
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:57,150
I do not move from this chair.

1248
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:02,697
- Hi.
- Good evening.

1249
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:09,245
- Dan.
- Mike.

1250
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:10,329
Nice, Mike.

1251
01:19:11,873 --> 01:19:13,166
You're family?

1252
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:15,042
Uh, no. Just a friend.

1253
01:19:16,002 --> 01:19:16,753
Me too.

1254
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,880
Mom, it's there.

1255
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:22,133
Come on, everybody! Shh!
They are there, they are there!

1256
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:24,427
Mikey! Hurry! Come on!

1257
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:26,512
The lights!

1258
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:41,736
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

1259
01:19:43,988 --> 01:19:44,947
Oona Where?

1260
01:19:47,325 --> 01:19:48,701
I do not know
it is not coming together.

1261
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:52,789
- Well, it does not matter.
- Happy birthday, darling.

1262
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:10,056
What?

1263
01:20:10,556 --> 01:20:12,141
You're... beautiful.

1264
01:20:13,976 --> 01:20:14,727
Cow!

1265
01:20:15,603 --> 01:20:17,688
This is not the reaction
I expected, but...

1266
01:20:19,232 --> 01:20:20,483
I want to crush them.

1267
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:24,070
I beg you.
It's your birthday, after all.

1268
01:20:44,298 --> 01:20:45,967
Mi hija. Puritan Meyos if?

1269
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:47,510
Lo tienes you well.

1270
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:57,019
Hi.

1271
01:21:13,536 --> 01:21:15,246
<i> I hope someday you'll leave me </i>

1272
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,624
<i> make you happy </i>

1273
01:21:25,006 --> 01:21:26,507
This is perfect, thank you.

1274
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:28,175
Excuse me, Ms. Depaul.

1275
01:21:29,427 --> 01:21:31,012
Luz wants me to translate.

1276
01:21:31,137 --> 01:21:32,221
Wonderful.

1277
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:36,434
No tenemos that ser amigas.

1278
01:21:36,601 --> 01:21:37,768
We are not friends.

1279
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:39,645
I'm sorry.

1280
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:42,523
No, that's not it, sorry.
I'm a little rusty.

1281
01:21:42,815 --> 01:21:46,360
In fact, she said that
you're not forced to be friends.

1282
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:47,653
Okay.

1283
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:51,240
Uberiasi lo mejor if
unos dos o tres años

1284
01:21:51,574 --> 01:21:55,870
Jesse y Soledad uviren
passado a mess in secreto.

1285
01:21:57,538 --> 01:21:58,998
It would have been easier

1286
01:21:59,290 --> 01:22:02,710
if
Jesse and Soledad had begun to see themselves in secret.

1287
01:22:03,044 --> 01:22:07,256
If lo  Y
viso ubiaramos descuvierto irritando llorano.

1288
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:11,719
And if we had discovered
and it would have enraged...

1289
01:22:11,886 --> 01:22:13,971
Andriamos Amory knew that acceptar

1290
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:16,807
nuestras familias despues of that is casaran.

1291
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:20,978
... and they have forced us to accept
their love and their families

1292
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:22,188
after their marriage.

1293
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:24,690
Oh, I would have preferred this version.

1294
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:29,320
Yo tambien lo preferia?

1295
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:32,740
Gracias.

1296
01:22:33,366 --> 01:22:36,994
Y por ahora, the Chinese yo Callara
y usted the dueña de la casa.

1297
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:40,164
In the meantime, I'm your wife and you
cleaning my boss.

1298
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:44,585
Good. Perfect. Excellent plan.
Do not you, Mikey?

1299
01:22:44,752 --> 01:22:46,087
Thank you, Luz.

1300
01:22:46,253 --> 01:22:49,006
Uh, are a good level.
Muy bien, Luz.

1301
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:50,216
Gracias.

1302
01:22:50,383 --> 01:22:51,384
Gracias.

1303
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:27,294
No, I think, look,
is more like it.

1304
01:23:28,295 --> 01:23:30,256
And uh, not that I know.

1305
01:23:34,552 --> 01:23:35,553
Oona!

1306
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:36,762
Good evening.

1307
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:39,015
Jesse! Steph! Paul!

1308
01:23:39,974 --> 01:23:41,142
J'voulais hear my name.

1309
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,354
Please!
The queen of the party!

1310
01:23:57,908 --> 01:23:59,326
Oona, your Timer.

1311
01:24:05,416 --> 01:24:06,459
What? You have a timer?

1312
01:24:07,418 --> 01:24:08,461
Uh, yes.

1313
01:24:08,836 --> 01:24:10,838
Since when you
a countdown, honey?

1314
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:13,424
Since yesterday evening.

1315
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:15,843
Steph!

1316
01:24:16,969 --> 01:24:20,097
I think I
aggravated the situation by inviting Mikey.

1317
01:24:28,522 --> 01:24:30,399
- I'm Marion.
- Enchanted, Dan.

1318
01:24:31,442 --> 01:24:33,069
- Paul.
- Good evening. Dan.

1319
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:35,780
Dan, what do you do?

1320
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:39,867
Mikey!

1321
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:41,660
Mikey!

1322
01:25:17,655 --> 01:25:19,949
Is it good?
Because it is more presentable.

1323
01:25:20,783 --> 01:25:21,992
Yes, but at the same time,

1324
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:24,411
Theme of the evening is a bit
misfires stuff.

1325
01:25:27,123 --> 01:25:27,915
Okay?

1326
01:25:28,999 --> 01:25:29,792
Are you kidding?

1327
01:25:32,419 --> 01:25:34,046
No. We could talk about.

1328
01:25:34,213 --> 01:25:35,714
No, I do not want to talk about.

1329
01:25:36,882 --> 01:25:39,552
I began to appreciate our relationship.

1330
01:25:39,718 --> 01:25:42,304
I found my feelings
young schoolgirl frightened.

1331
01:25:42,555 --> 01:25:44,723
I did not want you to look at another
me.

1332
01:25:51,147 --> 01:25:51,856
Hi.

1333
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:54,692
Good evening.

1334
01:25:57,528 --> 01:25:59,655
This is a fucking Greek tragedy here.

1335
01:26:00,698 --> 01:26:02,366
I'll go, it will be better.

1336
01:26:02,867 --> 01:26:03,659
No!

1337
01:26:04,118 --> 01:26:06,078
It is rather for me to leave.

1338
01:26:06,871 --> 01:26:09,039
You surely want to be a little lonely.

1339
01:26:09,206 --> 01:26:11,667
Steph, please. Talk to me.

1340
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:14,795
OK.

1341
01:26:17,423 --> 01:26:19,717
I'll never forgive
have screwed up

1342
01:26:19,884 --> 01:26:22,136
the only romantic relationship of my entire career.

1343
01:26:23,429 --> 01:26:25,890
Nothing is...  screwed up.

1344
01:26:26,015 --> 01:26:28,642
- You, I do not need your help.
- You do not talk to him like that.

1345
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:31,854
You'll yell at me and him thou engueuleras not?

1346
01:26:31,979 --> 01:26:33,981
It is he who has made a timer installed

1347
01:26:34,273 --> 01:26:36,567
at the worst time that can exist!

1348
01:26:36,734 --> 01:26:38,319
I had no idea
what would happen...

1349
01:26:38,485 --> 01:26:41,155
New. Given all the time
did you get started in my life

1350
01:26:41,322 --> 01:26:43,407
you could let me have
two minutes with my sister!

1351
01:26:43,574 --> 01:26:45,493
Will you stop being such a dirty slut?

1352
01:26:45,618 --> 01:26:47,036
Hey, you're
who are mean to me!

1353
01:26:47,203 --> 01:26:50,372
Because it makes me sick, OK!
And I have the right to be angry!

1354
01:26:50,497 --> 01:26:53,500
It seems a little unfair
that you have everything you want and I...

1355
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,796
Do you realize?
Everyone we know had a countdown.

1356
01:26:57,963 --> 01:27:00,174
But  us, we had Timers
complete rubbish!

1357
01:27:00,299 --> 01:27:02,009
It was us against the world.

1358
01:27:04,345 --> 01:27:05,638
I'm not the world.

1359
01:27:08,098 --> 01:27:09,308
Now you are.

1360
01:27:14,188 --> 01:27:16,315
- Can you give us a minute?
- With joy.

1361
01:27:22,446 --> 01:27:23,113
You know...

1362
01:27:23,781 --> 01:27:26,492
I took this Timer
thanks to you, Steph.

1363
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:29,411
Because I spent more time with you

1364
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:31,538
and less
I want to be alone.

1365
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,793
And there should be
a good side to all this,

1366
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:38,587
is that I know you'll
part of my life forever.

1367
01:27:48,097 --> 01:27:49,598
"If there is a bright side to all this"...

1368
01:27:50,557 --> 01:27:53,352
Looks like you did
a wonderful first impression.

1369
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:55,896
Who is it?

1370
01:27:56,814 --> 01:27:57,773
This is Dan.

1371
01:27:58,357 --> 01:27:59,108
Superdan.

1372
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:01,986
You have a man in your life,
and you did not tell me anything, Steph?

1373
01:28:02,152 --> 01:28:04,613
If you had been a little less selfish
lately...

1374
01:28:08,659 --> 01:28:09,285
Okay.

1375
01:28:12,997 --> 01:28:16,000
Well then... That's what we'll do.

1376
01:28:17,835 --> 01:28:18,669
I'll go.

1377
01:28:19,253 --> 01:28:22,172
And you remains angry here.

1378
01:28:22,756 --> 01:28:26,218
And if you want, you can stay angry
all weekend

1379
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:27,845
but Monday morning,
you come home.

1380
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:30,639
You're the person I love most in the world.

1381
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:33,225
You are my soul mate
from the beginning and you know it.

1382
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:34,435
Love...

1383
01:28:35,436 --> 01:28:37,313
It's not worth it,
if you're not near me.

1384
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:15,225
Hello.

1385
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:35,245
Where are the others?

1386
01:29:36,372 --> 01:29:38,332
They have a concert in San Francisco.

1387
01:29:40,584 --> 01:29:41,460
You're not with them?

1388
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:44,213
I had something planned for yesterday.

1389
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:51,053
Fuck Timer.

1390
01:29:52,554 --> 01:29:54,848
Really,
I have nothing more to do now.

1391
01:29:55,182 --> 01:29:57,226
Should I walk
at sunset with a stranger

1392
01:29:57,393 --> 01:29:59,853
but that is not what I want!

1393
01:30:00,187 --> 01:30:02,231
No, you freaking out because you got what you wanted
.

1394
01:30:02,398 --> 01:30:04,483
No, this is not what I wanted!

1395
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:06,318
Look!

1396
01:30:06,819 --> 01:30:09,113
I've taken!
It is clear, right?

1397
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:11,865
And I know very well what you think
.

1398
01:30:12,157 --> 01:30:13,242
Whether it is useless

1399
01:30:14,118 --> 01:30:15,786
because I've found

1400
01:30:15,953 --> 01:30:18,914
I know who is supposed to be my soul mate
,

1401
01:30:19,081 --> 01:30:19,957
it's too late

1402
01:30:20,124 --> 01:30:21,750
that I can not go back,

1403
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:24,044
I have done it for nothing.
Is that it?

1404
01:30:25,879 --> 01:30:28,257
This is what you think here?
Do not you?

1405
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:33,178
Your sentence is too long,
I forgot the beginning.

1406
01:30:36,098 --> 01:30:37,057
But it's too late.

1407
01:30:39,184 --> 01:30:42,312
How can it be too late?
You do not even believe in the Timer!

1408
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:44,773
I do not think its use,
but I think it works.

1409
01:30:45,691 --> 01:30:48,402
And even if it works, we do not know how long
he and I will...

1410
01:30:48,569 --> 01:30:49,987
In a year, we'll be together?

1411
01:30:59,413 --> 01:31:01,415
One year, it's been a while.

1412
01:31:01,582 --> 01:31:03,167
My answer is yes.

1413
01:31:05,085 --> 01:31:07,045
We'll be together,
I doubt it.

1414
01:31:09,590 --> 01:31:12,468
My answer is not
on the Timer.

1415
01:31:12,634 --> 01:31:13,177
I know.

1416
01:31:15,471 --> 01:31:16,763
This is because you're not in love with me
.

1417
01:31:21,685 --> 01:31:24,396
I was in love with you.

1418
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:31,904
I think I was.

1419
01:31:39,703 --> 01:31:41,914
I think I blew it.

1420
01:31:42,873 --> 01:31:43,624
You think not?

1421
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,543
Maybe.

1422
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:51,131
You're awfully stoic.

1423
01:31:52,716 --> 01:31:54,593
I never heard that word,

1424
01:31:55,969 --> 01:31:59,223
But you broke my heart
and I'm trying to save the appearance there.

1425
01:32:01,391 --> 01:32:03,310
So, if you could leave me alone!

1426
01:32:09,358 --> 01:32:09,983
Shit!

1427
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:23,413
Everything was so much simpler when you had your
false Timer.

1428
01:32:26,833 --> 01:32:28,752
Because you were not obliged to play
little couple?

1429
01:32:30,879 --> 01:32:34,174
No. Because I kept thinking
in the future, as you told me.

1430
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:39,763
I was just with you
and I loved it.

1431
01:32:43,684 --> 01:32:44,601
Yeah, good.

1432
01:32:45,561 --> 01:32:47,521
I appreciate you're done you remove this thing.

1433
01:32:54,194 --> 01:32:55,112
There will be a trace?

1434
01:32:58,365 --> 01:32:59,449
A scar, yes.

1435
01:33:01,535 --> 01:33:02,578
You touched me.

1436
01:33:06,415 --> 01:33:07,791
In a good way?

1437
01:33:09,585 --> 01:33:10,460
Very good, yes.

1438
01:33:22,723 --> 01:33:25,142
I'm glad you in
hast nothing to do Timer.

1439
01:33:29,438 --> 01:33:31,398
Way, you'll make
a good opinion of him.

1440
01:33:32,649 --> 01:33:33,525
Love him.

1441
01:34:07,142 --> 01:34:09,061
It is 8:37 in the morning.

1442
01:34:09,353 --> 01:34:10,729
I thought you were dead.

1443
01:34:12,022 --> 01:34:12,773
Hello.

1444
01:34:14,358 --> 01:34:15,108
Hi.

1445
01:34:47,849 --> 01:34:49,101
They are weird, huh?

1446
01:34:54,815 --> 01:34:56,566
This is my team relay race.

1447
01:34:57,234 --> 01:35:00,737
I put them these masks.
This is something hunters in Bangladesh.

1448
01:35:01,071 --> 01:35:04,991
- That way they avoid...
- Yes. I know, I saw the story.

1449
01:35:06,576 --> 01:35:09,830
I know they wear their masks
in the back to scare the tigers.

1450
01:35:09,996 --> 01:35:10,956
Exactly.

1451
01:35:11,123 --> 01:35:13,917
Us, it is used to terrify
those who think they can follow us.

1452
01:35:14,084 --> 01:35:15,627
I see. Fun.

1453
01:35:15,794 --> 01:35:16,795
- Fun, really?
- Yes!

1454
01:35:19,297 --> 01:35:20,799
And you, what are you doing on my trail
?

1455
01:35:21,216 --> 01:35:22,551
This is my hunting ground.

1456
01:35:22,718 --> 01:35:24,469
From 7:00 to 8:00
a quarter.

1457
01:35:24,803 --> 01:35:26,680
Yes.
I have had a overslept.

1458
01:35:31,059 --> 01:35:33,395
I apologize for being so mean.

1459
01:35:34,688 --> 01:35:36,189
Okay. I understand.

1460
01:35:45,449 --> 01:35:46,575
Do not take it personally.

1461
01:35:48,201 --> 01:35:49,911
This is nothing. All is well.

1462
01:35:50,454 --> 01:35:53,623
I'm glad you're okay.
When mine became virgin

1463
01:35:53,790 --> 01:35:55,333
I thought you were taking a bus you.

1464
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:00,881
I'm fine.

1465
01:36:02,632 --> 01:36:04,801
I'll go back to my team.

1466
01:36:06,136 --> 01:36:07,220
Yes. Okay.

1467
01:36:11,558 --> 01:36:12,934
Try to be late more often
.

1468
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:18,899
Ciao.
