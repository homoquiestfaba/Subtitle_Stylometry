1
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,709
-What's it guzzle?
-About twenty litres. Roughly.

2
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,557
Cheap to run. Good car.

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,037
Does it run on gas or diesel?

4
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,594
Depends on what
you teach it to use.

5
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,038
Not bad, eh?

6
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,032
I can give you a good price.
What's your offer?

7
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,553
We haven't got much.

8
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,908
How much?

9
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,628
Eight.

10
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,229
-Eight what?
-Thousand.

11
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,030
Eight thousand crowns?

12
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,878
Let's look there, then.

13
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,789
Take a good look at this one.
It's a Pontiac.

14
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,549
This is what the one over
there could look like.

15
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,152
When you put it together.

16
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,993
Eight thousand crowns. A '93
model, ABS, air conditioning.

17
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,074
-Where's the engine?
-In the shed.

18
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,670
But it's registered
and has number plates.

19
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,311
But we want to drive it tomorrow.

20
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,318
Well guys, you should have
put more away. Sorry.

21
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,271
We've fucked!

22
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,554
Is there anything here that
we could drive away?

23
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,549
This Kadet's not too bad.

24
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,393
They can all run. Back there we've
engines, wheels... no problem.

25
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,988
Just needs a simple fix-up.

26
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,951
-But we want to hit the road now.
-Let's take a look over there.

27
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,714
-But none of them are registered.
-Let me worry about the papers.

28
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,710
Plates too.
I like you guys, you go far.

29
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,479
I'm going to give you choice.
French plates.

30
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,435
Just say ''Bonjour''. Works a treat
to the cops if they stop you...

31
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,472
They're stupid.
They'll let you go.

32
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,196
German doesn't work anymore.
''Guten Tag'' they know...

33
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,880
-So, French plates are better.
-I won't be driving it...

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,913
Doesn't matter who's driving.
It's just a better cover.

35
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,555
-So how much?
-How much d'you have?

36
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,155
-Eight thousand.
-Eight?

37
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,953
You're kidding me. I should chuck
this in and do charity work.

38
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,269
So it's a deal?

39
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,320
THE RIDE

40
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,511
<i>We'll find a place</i>

41
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,794
<i>where the smoking's good.</i>

42
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,916
<i>Where the hot sun</i>

43
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,751
<i>doesn't sting the drinks.</i>

44
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:19,510
<i>Where the wind spreads</i>
<i>bits of bird shit</i>

45
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,791
<i>all around us and says</i>

46
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:41,069
<i>We've got to try</i>
<i>what tastes the best</i>

47
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:53,154
<i>and calmly wait</i>
<i>till someone comes.</i>

48
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:07,629
<i>Someone who knows</i>
<i>that we're sitting here,</i>

49
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,550
<i>and who will say ''hi, boys''.</i>

50
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,997
<i>I've got one long arm.</i>

51
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,432
<i>One long arm for you.</i>

52
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,235
<i>Come sit with us</i>

53
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,957
<i>we'll listen to you.</i>

54
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,350
<i>We'll think on what</i>

55
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:00,635
<i>we've got to do.</i>

56
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,391
<i>Give us your hand</i>

57
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:14,119
<i>and you'll relax...</i>

58
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:34,510
<i>on that spot</i>
<i>where one feels blue.</i>

59
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,915
Bonjourrr...

60
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,554
The main roads are
for cops and criminals.

61
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,309
The side roads are for us.

62
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,070
Haven't we been here before?

63
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,719
The Prague Health Dept.
issued a warning...

64
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,593
...about the poor quality
of water in swimming pools.

65
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,913
This is due
to people peeing in the water.

66
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:47,033
And, quote: ''Everyone's peeing'',
say City health officials.

67
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,389
It says that a shrew

68
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,080
is around one and a half times
the length of a credit card.

69
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,198
That's a progress.

70
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,513
We used to use match boxes

71
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,114
to compare the scale of things.

72
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,472
God for instance.

73
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,517
Let's check this scale.

74
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,070
-So what's the verdict?
-God is great!

75
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,151
Let's plug ourselves
into the world.

76
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,951
A Roumanian girl would be ideal.

77
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,476
-What for?
-We could share her both.

78
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,238
-They're good, eh?
-No, but if she didn't like it,

79
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,875
she couldn't complain,
nobody would understand her.

80
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,238
And we could say that we
thought she wanted to, right?

81
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,909
Or a Hungarian. For sure.

82
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,870
-Aren't they all ugly?
-We can't be too choosy.

83
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,757
Or we can pick up a real
beauty, have her in the woods...

84
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,077
But then we'd have to bury her.

85
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,234
We got a shovel.

86
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,910
A tropical heat wave has
paralyzed traffic in the capital.

87
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,637
Traffic on most major routes
is gridlocked and not moving.

88
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,399
Seems as if it never will.

89
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,635
Good afternoon.

90
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,588
-C'mon. We'll give you a ride.
-Oh no, boys, it's not worth it.

91
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,439
-I live here in this village.
-C'mon. Here.

92
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,312
But it's really not worth it.

93
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,197
-Your rake...
-See, with my rake.

94
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,312
Such a nice car.
I'll only scratch it up.

95
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,556
You'll sit up front...

96
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,276
-Here we go.
-Where are coming from?

97
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:33,555
Oh, the fields.
Working, you know. Raking hay.

98
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,153
-You still rake hay?
-Sure.

99
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,590
-And where do you come from?
-We're from Prague.

100
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,431
I hope you find some nice
ladies and enjoy your holiday.

101
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,269
-Stop right here, by this lady.
-Here?

102
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,995
I told you, it's not worth it...

103
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,914
Now can I have my rake.
Thank you.

104
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,034
Where were you...
...that you needed a lift.

105
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,713
They were just nice boys...
from Prague.

106
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,477
Even then we only gave
her a short lift.

107
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,159
It was still a good deed!

108
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,839
If we hadn't taken her,
we'd be three miles further.

109
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,639
But it's not true.
It's impossible.

110
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,079
So we're actually three miles
behind, you see...

111
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:45,318
So, whatever happens from now on
wasn't meant to be.

112
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,196
A magic moment.
What's up? Where you going?

113
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,078
The reward for our good deed.

114
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,638
Hi. Want a ride?

115
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,988
What are you doing here?
C'mon. Get in.

116
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,432
You'll die here.
Ants will eat you alive.

117
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,512
-What were you doing there?
-Nothing.

118
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,270
So what were you leaving behind?

119
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,234
Panties.

120
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,313
Where to?

121
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,514
Doesn't matter.
I'll get off somewhere.

122
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,189
-We can take you home...
-No.

123
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,197
Did something happen to you?

124
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,317
I'd like a drink.

125
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,838
Can be arranged.

126
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,233
What's he doing?

127
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,113
Arshole.

128
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,109
-Do you speak English?
-Czech.

129
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,954
You didn't see a redhead
somewhere around here?

130
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,077
-No.
-No, we haven't.

131
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,792
What do you want to drink, then?

132
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,399
Gin.

133
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,671
No ice. And tonic.

134
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,358
-There's no gin.
-Doesn't matter.

135
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,515
What?

136
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,798
She says it doesn't matter.

137
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,714
What?

138
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,479
-It doesn't matter.
-Fernet, then.

139
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,114
-So what does she want?
-Fernet.

140
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,318
What's this place called?

141
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,678
Where are you going?

142
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,113
South.

143
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,999
The sea?

144
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:21,595
The car hasn't any papers,
so it can't cross the border.

145
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,832
So what do you do
when you get to the border?

146
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,911
We'll go either east or west.

147
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,716
-Going through Pelhrimov?
-No.

148
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,916
But we can take you there
if you want.

149
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,234
What I really want is a drink.

150
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,711
Who was that in the car?

151
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,472
A guy.

152
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,232
Did he do something to you?

153
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,399
No.

154
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,279
What did she say?

155
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,633
Nothing.
I think she's a bit wacky.

156
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,237
Well then work on her.
She could...

157
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,912
Did you notice that she hasn't
put those panties on yet?

158
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,432
That means that under that skirt,
she's actually, you know...

159
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,275
I guess so. And probably
doesn't even know it.

160
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,233
You think she's, like,
nuts or something?

161
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,633
I don't know.

162
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,633
Well, no point in us
fighting over her.

163
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,713
Look, she's put them back.

164
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,151
So she's not totally nuts.

165
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,518
So we won't get to see
her little pussy after all.

166
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,073
Hey look. A mirage.

167
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,512
That's where I'd like to go.
Just disappear.

168
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,877
It's the heat.
We say the air is sweating.

169
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,830
-Have you got any money?
-Money?

170
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,070
Why do you want to know?
Do you?

171
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,795
I don't have any. So you'll
have to look after me now.

172
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,352
Aha...?

173
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,355
That's why I'd like to know
if you have any money.

174
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,357
Why? Do you want it or what?

175
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,072
-No...
-So I don't get it.

176
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,470
Well, if I want something...

177
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,277
And do you want anything?

178
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,959
I'd like an ice-cream. A Magnum.

179
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,196
D'you want to sit up front?

180
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,675
C'mon.

181
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,791
So will you tell me your name?

182
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,357
Why? Does it matter? I'll be
getting off soon anyway.

183
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,157
Where are you getting out?
In Nepomuk?

184
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,636
So why don't you come with us
to Susice at least, eh?

185
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,351
-What do you think you're doing?
-I should be asking you that.

186
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,473
Our contract states that this
fridge is property of Algida.

187
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,670
You can't put other stuff
in here. Pragolaktos, Scholler.

188
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,792
I'm surprised you don't keep
chicken and spinach in here too.

189
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,078
So it's Annie?

190
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,994
I'm Radek. Hi.

191
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,190
-Cute little knuckles.
-Don't say that.

192
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,351
Why not? I want to...

193
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,112
It's just talk. Isn't it?

194
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,475
I don't have another freezer.

195
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,672
Freezers should be provided by
those companies that supply you.

196
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,870
I am hereby disconnecting
and sealing ours.

197
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,029
So what should I say
to make you stay with us?

198
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,878
Am I going anywhere?

199
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,838
-Well, no. Not yet you aren't.
-So don't say anything yet.

200
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,752
Do I annoy you?

201
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,078
No. It's just...
I don't want to talk now.

202
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,637
Will you require
a receipt for these samples?

203
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,389
That way I could record how much
of the other stuff there was.

204
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,593
-Well then don't bother.
-Alright then. One more Magnum.

205
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,350
See you.

206
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,959
-It's freezing me!
-So put it on the floor.

207
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,278
No! It's mine. Mine!

208
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,439
Oh, shit!

209
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,518
<i>Come here, little mouse,</i>
<i>come to me</i>!!

210
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,438
N<i>o I won't, little cat,</i>
<i>you'd eat me.</i>

211
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:53,396
Y<i>es you will, yes you will,</i>
<i>you know it, too.</i>

212
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,398
D<i>og</i>!! K<i>ill the cat</i>!!
K<i>ill the cat</i>!!

213
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:09,198
<i>I want to look,</i>
<i>want to look at it.</i>

214
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,792
<i>I want to look as it</i>
<i>s</i>q<i>ueals under your paws.</i>

215
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,878
<i>And if it survives,</i>
<i>if it survives...</i>

216
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,039
<i>...I'll tie you up, and let</i>
<i>the cat scratch out your eyes.</i>

217
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,829
<i>And then I'll wrap myself up</i>
<i>in barbed wire and plug it...</i>

218
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,272
<i>...into a socket and</i>
<i>release the devil.</i>

219
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,598
I get the feeling he really
wants to see you again.

220
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,318
Poor guy.
He must be really mad.

221
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,831
Why are you running
away from him?

222
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,632
I don't like him anymore.
I don't want him.

223
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,592
So why are you going
with him, then?

224
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,432
He does whatever he wants...
...with me.

225
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,357
So we'll teach him
a lesson, right?

226
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,716
Do you have a gun?

227
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:06,308
No, we don't. Unless
there's one in the trunk.

228
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,398
Does he have one?

229
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,599
No. But he might have got one.

230
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,711
That would be just like him:
he's really aggressive.

231
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,432
He once kicked the shit out
of a guy...

232
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,028
...just because
he was talking to me.

233
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,712
Beat him to a pulp.

234
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,229
Is he really such a tough guy?

235
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,311
Are you that afraid of him?

236
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,392
I messed up my dress.

237
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,911
Totally.

238
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,956
That can be washed.

239
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:27,312
I don't have anything to change
into. It's all in his car.

240
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:08,511
-So what do you think?
-Why do you ask? You want her.

241
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,792
Well, if you want to know,
I am not having fun.

242
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,037
Since we picked her up we've
hardly spoken to each other.

243
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,512
We're wasting our time
running away from some arshole.

244
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,555
-At least something's happening.
-She's only got that one dress.

245
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,639
And I bet she's used
to a lot of money.

246
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,679
I bet she'd expect a hotel.

247
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,638
You think she's going to stay
with us overnight?

248
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,799
She'll smoke all of our grass and
then we'll never get rid of her.

249
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,715
-That wouldn't bother me at all.
-I don't mind either.

250
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,436
But for God's sake,
go screw her. Just look at you.

251
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:54,714
-Now? In broad daylight? No.
-I'll swimm the other way.

252
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,398
Hey, come on... don't.

253
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,317
-I'll turn around if you're shy.
-I'm not shy.

254
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,509
If I were a guy,
I couldn't bear it.

255
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,398
What?

256
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,516
The way it shrinks
like that in the water.

257
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,436
It must be awfully humiliating?

258
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,273
It's normal.
Happens to everyone.

259
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,196
-Let's go for a walk somewhere.
-Where's the other guy?

260
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,711
Over there, on the other side.
He wants to be alone.

261
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,228
So, what's the story
with the panties?

262
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,353
Well,
I was being a bit naughty.

263
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:42,593
Can you believe
I had to take them off...

264
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,159
...and throw them away just because
someone else gave them to me.

265
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,356
-Would that upset you too?
-Who'd you get them from?

266
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,276
-I don't know. My Mum, I guess.
-Oh, from your Mum!

267
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,989
Don't. Not here.

268
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,633
Why not?

269
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,351
-I can't make love.
-Why can't you?

270
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,516
Because I'm not turned on.

271
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,148
So tell me what to do
to turn you on.

272
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,231
But I don't want
to be turned on.

273
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,391
Well. That's different.

274
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:49,713
Maybe we'll make love.
But not here and not now.

275
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,833
We're free-wheeling.

276
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,796
-Can I take the keys out?
-No!

277
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,230
The steering wheel would lock.
And that curve would finish us.

278
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,554
Why do we have to follow
the road all the time?

279
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,398
Such a nice hill...
Why can't we just go straight?

280
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,594
We can do anything we want.
We can go straight.

281
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,397
OK. We're going straight.

282
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,751
Take off your glasses.

283
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,993
Well, kids: it's been great.
Good bye.

284
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,391
Bye. Ciao.

285
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,229
Too bad we didn't get to know
each other better.

286
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,556
-But I'm afraid.
-Too late.

287
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,071
It's locked now. Hang on.

288
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,348
We going to die?

289
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,473
Mummy!

290
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,628
I think I bit my tongue.

291
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,998
Oh, blood.

292
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,468
When I look up at the sky,

293
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,271
I see these two little
bubbles or more like spots.

294
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,758
Where?

295
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,989
Only I can see them.
They're in my eye somewhere.

296
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,829
And they just go sailing
through the sky...

297
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:17,719
When I don't look at them,

298
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,631
they go where I'm looking.

299
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,476
But when I try to look at them,

300
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,068
then they go off somewhere
on their own.

301
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:34,154
So I pretend not to look at them,
and then they come back to me.

302
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,159
And so I keep chasing them
through the sky.

303
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,992
With me, it's a little line.

304
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,716
I haven't seen it for a long
time, but it's still there.

305
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,434
Is there a moral in all this?

306
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,672
Don't know.

307
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,356
It's actually the first
video game in the world.

308
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,712
Can you hear that?

309
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,037
-In the air. Not on the ground.
-I know.

310
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,230
Smells nice, like those
air fresheners in washrooms.

311
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,952
I don't smell anything.

312
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,197
I can't smell anything.

313
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,518
They're in a hurry, eh?

314
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,798
A cable car. Take it down.

315
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,594
Hey Ferda!

316
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,354
Get Mary.
Wait, I'll get Mary.

317
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,513
I'm coming!
I've brought the broomsticks!

318
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,676
We're going
to clean it up here.

319
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,752
Get Betty; Betty will help you.

320
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,429
I'm the only female around.

321
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:13,993
And what are you going to do
if we all jump you?

322
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,071
You don't have what it takes.

323
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,350
Careful I don't bite you.

324
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,232
Mary.

325
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,629
I'll behave myself. So don't
make me do it with everyone.

326
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,391
We'll see about that.

327
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,757
Said Ferda.

328
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,628
Where is she?

329
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,273
Over there.

330
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,033
-Where's she going?
-I don't know.

331
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,510
-She's leaving!
-No she's not.

332
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,553
-She is! She's leaving us here.
-So let her go.

333
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,033
But she's got my t-shirt.

334
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,949
Wait, my t-shirt.

335
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,391
Hey mister! Don't take her!

336
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,348
Why did she do that?
She had a great time with us.

337
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,118
What a bitch!

338
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,472
-So you didn't get any?
-Of course not.

339
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,193
-She left her dress here.
-She doesn't care.

340
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,237
And we're up shit creek.

341
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,398
Guess what? It's cracked.

342
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,632
Great. So we're not fucking
going anywhere, are we?

343
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,158
-Nope. Not likely.
-Fuck...

344
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:18,998
-Hey Radek, you got a fetish?
-Bull. It's been washed.

345
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,597
Look, a tractor!

346
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,472
It's a work of art.

347
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,155
It's actually quite beautiful.

348
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,318
It's even signed. Armabeton.

349
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,875
Do you think
the pyramids are higher?

350
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,952
These have got to be higher.

351
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,917
Let's compare it to our matchbox.

352
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,075
Where's the steam?
Don't they work?

353
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,469
A work of art
isn't supposed to work.

354
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:00,637
It provokes
an emotional response.

355
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,753
They're telling us: ''Save,
energy, or we'll turn on.''

356
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:26,390
<i>An actress at the Comedie</i>
<i>told me</i>

357
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:33,317
<i>she'd take me away</i>
<i>to</i> N<i>owhereland.</i>

358
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:39,514
T<i>o</i> N<i>owhereland...</i>

359
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,991
Shit! It stinks.

360
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,155
I'm going to dry my dress.

361
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,596
T<i>he clouds fly</i>
<i>low above the ground.</i>

362
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,996
<i>Fly fast, my head is spinning.</i>

363
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:29,114
T<i>he clouds fly</i>
<i>low above the ground...</i>

364
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:34,917
<i>For the last time</i>
<i>I envy the clouds...</i>

365
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,589
<i>...the way that they can see</i>
<i>the world.</i>

366
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,316
T<i>he clouds fly</i>
<i>low above the ground...</i>

367
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:49,551
<i>One day she'll take me away...</i>

368
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,790
<i>far away...</i>

369
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,878
No one's in control!

370
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,199
What would you do,

371
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,232
what would you do if you had
only one year to live?

372
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,151
Depends on what you mean.

373
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:34,476
Well, would you drop everything
and just live it up...

374
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:40,192
Or would you try
to leave something behind?

375
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,271
What's the point of
leaving something behind?

376
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,035
One should leave
something behind.

377
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,548
Kids, at least.

378
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,393
So Frank, you can die in peace.

379
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,359
-You're a dad?
-Yeah.

380
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,550
-You're married?
-Yeah.

381
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,754
-And it's enough for you?
-Totally.

382
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,598
But in any event,
I don't want to die.

383
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,917
-And are you married?
-No way.

384
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,997
So you can do what you like...

385
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,000
-You could say that.
-So what do you do?

386
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,717
I've a girlfriend...

387
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,193
That's enough for you?

388
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,793
-Two hundred.
-Each?

389
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,718
-Per room.
-I'm sleeping in the car.

390
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,590
That's five Jim Beam's.
Hope she's worth it.

391
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,554
At least
she didn't steal anything.

392
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,716
Where did she go?

393
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,437
No money; nothing; at night.

394
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,472
She won't get lost.

395
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:41,311
She's gone.
I think she's really gone.

396
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,191
I should have gone with her
to the shower.

397
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,237
It was an invitation.
I should've gone up with her.

398
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,670
If only I didn't have that drink,
it would've been okay.

399
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:04,748
-I think it's fate or something.
-What?

400
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,998
That this particular girl
was on the road...

401
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,556
Jesus, if she's your fate,
then God help you.

402
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,838
What do I know?

403
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,673
-You really didn't like her?
-No.

404
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,071
Pretty girl.

405
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,390
Just forget her.

406
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,154
Such a cute smile.

407
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:44,312
Nice red hair. She had that
cute peachfuzz all over her...

408
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,718
Get some sleep.

409
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,759
All because of one drink...

410
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,875
One drink less,

411
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,878
and she'd still be here.

412
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,478
No need to wash.

413
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,828
No.

414
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,672
Then night.

415
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:24,556
-I brought breakfast.
-Hey, hi.

416
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,670
-What's this cat doing here?
-Sleeping.

417
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,639
Look what I did. Here.

418
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,476
-God, what happened?
-A wire with little thorns...

419
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,876
-It's called barbed wire.
-Where were you?

420
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:51,113
-Somewhere.
-All night?

421
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:56,960
And the wire was rusty. So now
I've got blood poisoning, right?

422
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,548
No you haven't.
You've been vaccinated.

423
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,598
''We're'' vaccinated

424
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:09,916
against tooth<i>/</i> mouth,
shedding and worms.

425
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:17,354
We've a dog. A German
Shepherd. He's really neurotic.

426
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:23,233
We always have to pay attention
to him, otherwise he bites.

427
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,873
Once I was playing with Johnny.

428
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,310
-The dog?
-No, the guy.

429
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,910
The one who's chasing us?

430
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:39,152
And I had him tied to the bed
by his hands and feet.

431
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,354
And we were playing around.

432
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:51,478
And when it grew hard,
I brought in the dog.

433
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:58,599
When the dog came up to him
he wanted to be petted.

434
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:04,831
He couldn't move or even shout
because that'd upset the dog.

435
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:10,518
He just lay there.
He couldn't do anything.

436
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:18,870
And I stood behind the door
and watched him sweat in fear.

437
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:28,910
''Throwing rocks into the river
and on the slopes is forbidden.''

438
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,759
''Irresponsible behaviour can lead
to serious injury to persons...''

439
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:40,956
''...in the afore-mentioned areas.''
The International City Council.

440
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,517
Why don't you have
the dog put down?

441
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,713
-But we love him. He's ours.
-So how did it turn out?

442
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,719
-Did he bite it off?
-No. He just sniffed it.

443
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,038
I sure wouldn't
let you tie me up.

444
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,997
But we haven't known each
other long enough.

445
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,549
Would they shoot at us
if he isn't armed?

446
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,195
It's true they only shoot
ones who're armed?

447
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,876
-How do you know he isn't?
-I didn't see a gun.

448
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,155
Smile. It's the cops.

449
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,518
They're coming back.

450
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,952
BANK

451
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,633
-OK?
-Not bad.

452
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,078
When I do something I shouldn't,

453
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,430
I feel like everyone's
watching me.

454
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,030
That's because they are.
We should get out of here.

455
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,957
I need to pee.

456
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,711
-Are you scared?
-You don't want to?

457
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,399
Not at the moment.

458
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,716
What's taking him so long?

459
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,152
Where are you heading?

460
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,638
-Where do you want to go?
-To Hell.

461
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,433
Hell? Marie, some Hell...?

462
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:30,237
-Don't they mean Devil's Rocks?
-Oh yeah. Go down here...

463
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,552
No, go right here, right, left,
turn after half a mile...

464
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,113
Let's go!

465
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,550
-Got it?
-Got it. -How much?

466
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,636
-I took a thousand.
-Great.

467
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,509
Guys, I've got to pee.

468
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:25,270
-Shouldn't they be chasing us?
-We're safe now...

469
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,476
-Only a thousand crowns?
-It was only a village bank.

470
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,792
Can I drive now?

471
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,199
Do you know how?

472
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,553
I can't do the pedals. But
I can do the steering wheel.

473
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,076
Let's do it together.
I can only work the gears.

474
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:51,034
-So you don't need me anymore.
-You're going to do the pedals.

475
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:56,070
<i>A farmer in the field</i>

476
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:00,712
<i>was looking for his cow...</i>

477
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:04,753
<i>For him villages or towns,</i>

478
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,078
<i>didn't matter now,</i>

479
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:17,119
<i>nothing but that cow,</i>
<i>hiding in the grass...</i>

480
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:25,193
<i>as high as the ocean's deep.</i>

481
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:32,990
<i>Black water, blind fish,</i>
<i>poisonous sea beasts,</i>

482
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:40,434
<i>in the farmer's head came</i>
<i>the snap of the thread.</i>

483
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,471
<i>His spool's not turning,</i>

484
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:56,714
<i>and there's no conductor</i>
<i>to say...</i>

485
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:06,235
<i>... while stroking his hair.:</i>

486
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:13,474
Y<i>ou're with me on my train</i>
<i>in my care.</i>

487
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:43,552
I am driving!

488
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:40,112
Don't go home,
the contest hasn't finished...

489
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:45,590
I'd like to thank
to the volunteer Fire Department.

490
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,431
Go away, kids! Get lost!

491
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:48,957
So what's the story? You left
him, or he threw you out?

492
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,352
No. We had a fight.

493
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,955
And how long
have you been together?

494
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:10,752
About four years.
But we've argued a lot,

495
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:15,032
so we haven't been together
the whole time.

496
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,197
It's really more like two years.

497
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,473
And why do you fight?

498
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,757
Don't know.
Spice up our lives I guess.

499
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,398
And what do you do
when you're not fighting?

500
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:41,233
We go away somewhere
and fight there too.

501
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:50,030
-Want a smoke?
-I can't. I'm working.

502
00:58:53,440 --> 00:59:00,710
With the sun shining through
your ears, you look like an alien.

503
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,754
My little girlfriend...

504
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:34,270
For the monks who built this place
it was like taming the Wild West.

505
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:39,349
There was nothing here.
Only forests...

506
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,796
...and more forests.

507
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,752
Bears.

508
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,318
Wolves.

509
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,559
-And huge ants.
-How huge?

510
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:55,908
Like this.

511
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:03,398
The monks came with their saws.

512
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,670
And chopped down the trees.

513
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:12,510
They pulled out the stumps
and started hauling boulders.

514
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:16,235
But first,
they killed the huge ants.

515
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:23,630
I always thought of monks
as impotent cripples.

516
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:27,237
They were regular guys.
Musclemen.

517
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,869
And they did this all
by themselves?

518
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:38,960
Yup. They built, painted,
wrote, and prayed to God.

519
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,229
And there weren't any women?

520
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:48,832
Women weren't allowed here.
For seven-hundred years.

521
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,792
Do you smell it?

522
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:03,359
It's in all monasteries.
It's the spirit of the place.

523
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:06,510
It smells like this
in the confessional booth.

524
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:11,589
I read somewhere that
when men live without women,

525
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,993
they begin to give off
a funny smell.

526
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:19,074
What d'you call it?

527
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:25,755
-What are you trying to say?
-Something like ingraining?

528
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:30,718
Absorbtion?

529
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:33,877
Yeah. Absorbtion.
Semen absorbtion.

530
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:48,959
For seven hundred years,
it's been evaporating here.

531
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,835
I want you to do it to me here.

532
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,913
Wimp.

533
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:06,035
<i>I'm dying,</i>

534
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,516
<i>my strength's leaving me,</i>

535
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:23,317
<i>I forgive what I should,</i>

536
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:39,359
<i>and then I leave my body...</i>

537
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:51,874
<i>... while I turn into dust.</i>

538
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:06,833
<i>I'm dying and my only wish...</i>

539
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:19,630
<i>...is that</i>
<i>you will dream of me.</i>

540
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,033
It musn't smell of cow shit.

541
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,270
And I need my own room.

542
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,953
And I need a stove.

543
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,832
That little cottage looks nice.

544
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:37,270
Or that tiny little one.

545
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,912
This is a nice little cottage.

546
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,439
I'm scared.

547
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:31,352
That's that guy...
The one they set fire to.

548
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:33,994
-That's Palach, right?
-That's Hus.

549
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:37,318
That's the Red Fox. Sigmund.

550
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:42,588
And he's saying, hey, buddy,
you there, Mister Jan Hus.

551
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:50,355
Hey, that's Dusek.
From my school.

552
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,113
A guitar.

553
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,319
It's for me.

554
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:59,476
Look at all the little records.

555
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:06,678
Matuska, Sodoma...

556
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:12,508
-Neckar... Korn!
-Kids, remember Korn?

557
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,393
-You know how to turn it on?
-It still works?

558
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,433
A record.

559
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,429
Look. His picture's on it.

560
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:57,153
Winnetou laughs
from the window...

561
01:08:57,280 --> 01:09:01,831
...and Shatterhand
is kissing Rybana's breasts.

562
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:07,070
Inchuchuna in the yard
started up his motorcar.

563
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:12,673
Motorcar is bust.
Inchuchuna's dust.

564
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:13,994
Blow it out!

565
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,878
An old newspaper
from the communist times.

566
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:27,713
In Sri Lanka due to conflicts
between the majority Singhalese,

567
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:31,992
and the minority Tamils,
May Day has been outlawed.

568
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,319
Simple solution.

569
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:40,429
The National Congress
of Pathologists:

570
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,189
The official program has been
enlivened with a social event:

571
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,515
An evening organ pipe concert...

572
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:53,196
Hang glider pilots
participated in the parade.

573
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:02,114
Driver Hlasek delivered the cargo
straight to the Tymakov facility.

574
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:05,312
There the grain will remain
over the weekend.

575
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:11,913
Then it will be transported to
the Processing Centre in Prestice.

576
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:16,833
-I don't get it.
-What are you reading?

577
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:26,155
What is it?
It's a speech by Comrade Husak.

578
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:31,272
Every paragraph here starts with
Comrades this and Comrades that.

579
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,190
The Robin Hood of the desert...

580
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:40,471
Saddam Hussein is
distributing Kuwaiti land...

581
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,112
That was that war in the Gulf?

582
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:51,114
That was January fifteenth,
Ninety-One.

583
01:10:56,120 --> 01:11:00,432
Two days before the war,

584
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:04,075
I lost my virginity with Johnny.

585
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:14,154
You were under age, weren't you?

586
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:22,473
-I was fourteen.
-So now he is paying for it.

587
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:35,955
See how happy this piece looks.
While all you guys do is argue.

588
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:41,709
I had my first hysterical fit
of laughter playing this game.

589
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:43,912
I was six.

590
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,432
What's that?

591
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:01,350
It's called a phone. An invention
over a hundred years old.

592
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,796
Why is it ringing?

593
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:15,514
Did you know that
the Americans won the WWII...

594
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:18,473
...because they knew
how to use the telephone?

595
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:28,150
Loser gets us
something to drink.

596
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,312
And some food.

597
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,436
-Five.
-That's silly.

598
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,474
Two.

599
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,632
Ha! One.

600
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,591
That's stupid.

601
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:01,112
But you're going to have to go
anyway. Radek can't drive.

602
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:12,349
How come she's doesn't have
anything there?

603
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:16,918
I wonder what they look like now.
How old they must be.

604
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,115
Maybe fifty. Or sixty.

605
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:34,078
What would you have done, if
you had stayed here with Frank?

606
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,558
He's a man.

607
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,638
What do you mean by that?

608
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,996
He'd take what he wants.

609
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,509
So you'd sleep with him?

610
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,274
Anne, would you?

611
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,754
I want to talk
about something else.

612
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,954
Yeah, but this interests me,
so tell me.

613
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:08,752
You want to know?

614
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:11,878
You really want to know?

615
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,833
Yes I do.

616
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,959
And can you handle it?
Can you take it?

617
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,799
Maybe we already have.

618
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:38,919
When did you have the time to?
I was always with you.

619
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,835
Promise me that
you won't say anything.

620
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,513
I would feel ashamed
and you would look silly.

621
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:55,111
Maybe in Susice. You slept
like a baby all night.

622
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:02,512
-Frank wouldn't do it to me.
-Yes he would.

623
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:12,352
What are you going to do?

624
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,394
What?

625
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:23,111
-I don't know.
-Are you a man, or what?

626
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:31,796
Go away, will you?

627
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,548
Get lost. I'm bored.

628
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,714
When did he call?

629
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,597
It's always the same thing.

630
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:50,152
I don't know.
Somewhere in Sumava. In Loucky.

631
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,916
Yeah. Whatever he says.
I don't care.

632
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:20,914
Hi Anne.

633
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:22,989
What is it?

634
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:31,438
I don't want to!

635
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:38,672
It hurts! You bastard.
I'm going to scream.

636
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,480
C'mon does it really
hurt that much?

637
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:24,676
I don't want to cause you pain.
But it has to be done.

638
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:30,918
Don't. I won't scream anymore.

639
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,759
-You have to be brave.
-I couldn't stand it.

640
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:36,838
-It won't last long.
-My hands hurt.

641
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,239
I'm sorry.

642
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:50,593
Where are you going?
Don't leave me here.

643
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:53,993
Untie me you bastard!

644
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:04,430
What's that? What's that for?
What are you going to do with that?

645
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,318
Radek!

646
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,509
Radek, talk to me.

647
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,868
For God's sake,
what are you doing with that?

648
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,675
That's petrol.

649
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,599
I love you.

650
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,352
Don't scream.

651
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,030
But there are candles everywhere.

652
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:46,593
I know.

653
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:52,950
I made all that up,
about Frank. Everything.

654
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,914
You know, I actually
believed you for a while.

655
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,197
So why are you doing this?

656
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:08,594
-Because I love you.
-I love you too.

657
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:12,397
But we're just not getting it
together, are we?

658
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:17,393
It would always be like that.
We want it at different times.

659
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,910
Now we can make love.
Then it will all be over.

660
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:29,151
I haven't even said good-bye
to my Mum yet.

661
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:32,393
She has no idea where I am.

662
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:41,672
I've got beer and sausages.
When you're thru, I'll be outside.

663
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:50,398
I can't do this.

664
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:57,991
Do it.
Untie my legs and do it.

665
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:10,112
I want it.
I really really want it.

666
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:17,200
I can't do this.

667
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,395
One chicken, seventy five.

668
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:08,317
-Do you have any soups?
-We do, we do.

669
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:16,114
Packed soups, ghoulash,
beef, leek. I'll show you...

670
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:23,634
French, pea, beef...

671
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:14,834
-We should go after them.
-I don't think so.

672
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,718
I don't have her address
or telephone number.

673
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,789
If she wanted you to have it,
she'd have given it to you.

674
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,399
Sometimes girls forget to...

675
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:24,718
No they don't.

676
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:34,238
You know, I wonder...

677
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:40,597
...if she called him before
or after she was with you.

678
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:43,073
Why?

679
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:50,869
Well if she called after, then
that doesn't say much about you.

680
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,437
Alright. I'll tell you.

681
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,472
I never slept with her.

682
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,718
You're an idiot.

683
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:18,119
I really didn't.

684
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,119
We're free-wheeling.

685
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:41,195
Tailor, Sailor, Soldier, Daddy.

686
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,117
-Don't call me daddy.
-We are facing a major decision:

687
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:49,239
East or west.

688
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,997
Because we're through
with the south.

689
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:00,593
Shit, the cops.

690
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,439
Keep cool,
it's just an accident.

691
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,998
Oh God.

692
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:55,719
<i>We'll find a place</i>

693
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:00,994
<i>where the smoking's good,</i>

694
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:07,479
<i>where the hot sun</i>

695
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:13,516
<i>doesn't sting the drinks,</i>

696
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:23,715
<i>where the wind spreads</i>
<i>bits of bird shit</i>

697
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:31,030
<i>all around us and says</i>

698
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:41,068
<i>We've got to try</i>
<i>what tastes the best</i>

699
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:51,512
<i>and calmly wait</i>
<i>till someone comes.</i>

700
01:26:54,840 --> 01:27:03,555
<i>Someone who knows</i>
<i>that we're sitting here,</i>

701
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:10,158
<i>and who will say ''hi, boys. ''</i>

702
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:15,470
<i>I've got one arm long.</i>

703
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:21,236
<i>One long arm for you.</i>

704
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:29,959
<i>Come sit with us,</i>

705
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:35,552
<i>we'll listen to you.</i>

706
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:45,630
<i>We'll think on</i>
<i>what we've got to do,</i>

707
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:56,756
<i>Give us your hand</i>
<i>and you'll relax...</i>

708
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:14,588
<i>on that spot</i>
<i>where one feels blue.</i>

709
01:28:53,240 --> 01:29:02,558
<i>I've got one long arm...</i>
