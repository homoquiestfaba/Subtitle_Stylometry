turn down my music!

178
00:09:14,947 --> 00:09:16,676
Miss Gladys, this is my song!

179
00:09:16,716 --> 00:09:18,013
Malcolm...

180
00:09:19,552 --> 00:09:22,043
Yeah, yeah

181
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:25,080
Uh-huh, yeah

182
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:28,054
Well, well

183
00:09:28,094 --> 00:09:31,359
I wanna flaunt it, yeah

184
00:09:31,397 --> 00:09:34,230
Mr. King, sir.
How are we feeling today, sir?

185
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:37,702
Rich. Hey, Andre,
Benz is a little dusty, man.

186
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:38,965
Wash it for me.

187
00:09:39,004 --> 00:09:41,336
Your car is
in perfectly good hands.

188
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,967
MaKe sure you don`t scratch it.

189
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:46,136
JacKass.

190
00:09:46,178 --> 00:09:49,306
- Hey, Mr. King.
- Yes, that`s me.

191
00:09:49,348 --> 00:09:51,407
King Enterprises Limited.
Please hold.

192
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,678
Mr. King...

193
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:54,515
Hey, Charles.
Give me a half hour, OK?

194
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:55,679
OK.

195
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,211
Good morning, Mr. King.

196
00:09:57,256 --> 00:09:59,816
Hey, how`s my poor little
rich girl today?

197
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:01,326
Tell me, how does it feel...

198
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,089

199
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:06,565
Mr. King, worKing here
isn`t liKe worKing at all!

200
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:08,123
Ladies.
Good morning, ladies.

201
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:09,464
JacKass.

202
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:11,868
I have some feedbacK
from the photo shoot today.

203
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:15,465
OK, one minute. One minute.
Two words... biKini wax.

204
00:10:15,508 --> 00:10:18,602
LooKed liKe you had a midget
holding a fistful of twigs.

205
00:10:18,644 --> 00:10:20,475
- He`s not talKing about me.
- Oh!

206
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,979
Morning, Miss Gladys.

207
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:24,607
Morning, Malcolm.

208
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,346
Mmm. ThanK you.

209
00:10:27,386 --> 00:10:29,251
Miss Gladys...

210
00:10:29,288 --> 00:10:33,088
I need you to transfer 135,000
to my personal account.

211
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,252
L`m taKing delivery
of that Ferrari today.

212
00:10:35,294 --> 00:10:37,922
What did I tell you, Malcolm?
No way.

213
00:10:37,963 --> 00:10:39,828
But it`s my money!

214
00:10:39,865 --> 00:10:41,332
And it`s because of me
Keeping my eye on it...

215
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:42,834
that you have any left.

216
00:10:42,868 --> 00:10:45,063
You`re just gonna have to drive
one of your other five cars.

217
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:47,038
Here are your messages.

218
00:10:47,072 --> 00:10:48,596
ThanK you.

219
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:59,274
Oh. Peaches,
who`s on line two?

220
00:10:59,318 --> 00:11:01,183
Peaches?

221
00:11:02,321 --> 00:11:05,688
Peaches, who is on line two?

222
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,619
- Pea...
- Ange, I forget.

223
00:11:11,664 --> 00:11:15,862
Oh! Great. They hung up.

224
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:19,837
So, nothing
from Andrew Ross, huh?

225
00:11:19,872 --> 00:11:21,339
Ahem. No.

226
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:22,704
Damn it.

227
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:24,709
LooK, if we don`t close
this deal now...

228
00:11:24,743 --> 00:11:27,007
l`m gonna have to wait
another six weeKs.

229
00:11:27,046 --> 00:11:29,014
He`s about to go on
this stupid hot-air balloon...

230
00:11:29,048 --> 00:11:30,310
around-the-world expedition.

231
00:11:30,349 --> 00:11:33,614
You Know, white folKs is crazy.
But their money is sane.

232
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,711
Whoo! Their money is sane.

233
00:11:35,754 --> 00:11:37,415
You are about to give
a big old party...

234
00:11:37,456 --> 00:11:39,981
celebrating the tenth
anniversary of your company.

235
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:42,755
Why would you want to sell it
off to some spoiled rich Kid...

236
00:11:42,795 --> 00:11:44,353
IooKing to cash in
on what you`ve built?

237
00:11:44,396 --> 00:11:46,091
Because
that spoiled rich Kid...

238
00:11:46,131 --> 00:11:49,191
is about to give me
25 million for my company...

239
00:11:49,235 --> 00:11:50,634
so you damn well better
start warming up to him.

240
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:51,897
``Damn well``?!

241
00:11:51,937 --> 00:11:54,667
What did I tell you
about your mouth, boy?

242
00:11:54,707 --> 00:11:56,368
You Know I don`t liKe
no cussin` up in here.

243
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:58,205
Cuss again,
l`ll hit you upside your head.

244
00:11:58,244 --> 00:12:01,270
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.

245
00:12:01,313 --> 00:12:04,339
Your wife`s lawyer agreed
to have the meeting...

246
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:08,183
in the conference room
here tomorrow.

247
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,714
So... you finally decided
to divorce the bitch, huh?

248
00:12:12,758 --> 00:12:15,192
The bitch... is history.

249
00:12:15,227 --> 00:12:17,252
Ow! What?!

250
00:12:17,296 --> 00:12:18,627
What did I tell you
about your mouth?

251
00:12:18,664 --> 00:12:20,894
But you just said
the same thing, Miss Gladys!

252
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:24,027
Well, if I jump off a bridge,
you gonna jump off one, too?

253
00:12:26,972 --> 00:12:29,304
Lt`s not going so good
with Peaches, huh?

254
00:12:29,341 --> 00:12:32,276
Ohh...

255
00:12:32,311 --> 00:12:36,714
If this were a strip club
or an airhead convention.

256
00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:39,980
The last time I checKed,
we were a marKeting firm.

257
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:41,884
This is a place of business.

258
00:12:43,088 --> 00:12:45,283
We got worK to do.

259
00:12:45,324 --> 00:12:47,451
Angela, all God`s children
deserve a chance.

260
00:12:47,493 --> 00:12:49,723
Her dumb ass deserves the boot!

261
00:12:49,762 --> 00:12:50,922
OK, that`s not nice.

262
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:53,329
``Not nice``? Get...

263
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:57,525
l`m gonna tell you
what`s not nice.

264
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:02,006
It`s Malcolm King forcing me
to hire another one...

265
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,271
of his incompetent little
hoochies as my assistant.

266
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,777
I Know.

267
00:13:05,811 --> 00:13:07,779
I can`t stand Malcolm King...

268
00:13:07,813 --> 00:13:09,576
and King Enterprises.

269
00:13:09,615 --> 00:13:11,310
But if I wasn`t a locK
for that V.P. Position...

270
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,647
I would be out of here so fast.

271
00:13:12,685 --> 00:13:15,153
- Oh, I Know.
- I deserve the promotion anyway.

272
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:17,678
L`ve been doing the damn job
for the past few months.

273
00:13:17,723 --> 00:13:18,951
L`ve got a master`s degree
from Yale.

274
00:13:18,991 --> 00:13:21,653
- Yale.
- And 10 years of experience.

275
00:13:21,694 --> 00:13:23,321
I just got
the car of my dreams...

276
00:13:23,362 --> 00:13:25,193
I closed escrow
on a pretty three-bedroom.

277
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,494
I mean, my apartment
is pacKed up already.

278
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:29,330
L`ve got to get that promotion.

279
00:13:29,368 --> 00:13:30,699
Do you want me
to say a prayer for you?

280
00:13:30,736 --> 00:13:32,829
Not now.

281
00:13:32,871 --> 00:13:35,339
I don`t want you to taKe this
the wrong way...

282
00:13:35,374 --> 00:13:36,432
Yeah?

283
00:13:36,475 --> 00:13:38,306
But ever since you got saved...

284
00:13:38,344 --> 00:13:41,973
you`ve been a little...
extra with the God stuff.

285
00:13:42,014 --> 00:13:43,140
Extra?

286
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,676
Extra.

287
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:47,686
- My Jesus piece?
- Yeah.

288
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,517
I just got it.
It`s great, right?

289
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:54,954
Why is this happening?

290
00:13:54,994 --> 00:13:57,656
My milKshaKe brings
all the boys to the yard

291
00:13:57,696 --> 00:14:00,028
Guys, scram!

292
00:14:00,065 --> 00:14:03,364
Peaches, don`t you have
some worK to do?

293
00:14:03,402 --> 00:14:06,235
I finished my coloring.

294
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:17,340
Marco, taKe my coat.

295
00:14:17,383 --> 00:14:19,908
TaKe my coat.

296
00:14:19,952 --> 00:14:22,250
Yeah, you did
a good job on this, man...

297
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:23,982
but I thinK
you need to get the bacK.

298
00:14:24,023 --> 00:14:25,149
- Ahem.
- Yeah.

299
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,283
That`s a nice ride
you got there.

300
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:29,351
What does the ``King`` stand for?

301
00:14:29,395 --> 00:14:31,192
That`s my last name.

302
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,027
Ah, really?
So, what`s your first name?

303
00:14:33,065 --> 00:14:34,760
Malcolm.

304
00:14:36,402 --> 00:14:37,733
Mmm.

305
00:14:38,404 --> 00:14:41,168
Corey, get up here!

306
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:43,538
Coming, Granny.

307
00:14:43,575 --> 00:14:46,237
$300, and you got
all those wonderful things.

308
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:48,143
And l`m going to show you...

309
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:53,516
MaKe yourself useful.
Go picK me up a pacK of smoKes.

310
00:14:53,552 --> 00:14:55,611
Hand me my massage pillow,
will you?

311
00:14:55,654 --> 00:14:57,053
Right now, tonight.

312
00:14:57,089 --> 00:14:58,647
But now we`ve got
to get two traders...

313
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,952
who will risK what
they`ve already won...

314
00:14:59,992 --> 00:15:03,553
Here you go. OK?

315
00:15:03,595 --> 00:15:05,119
...sofa and color TV
worth 2,190...

316
00:15:05,164 --> 00:15:06,597
and they`re ready to go.

317
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,438
Unh!

318
00:15:28,187 --> 00:15:30,348
What`s the matter, big brother?
Ain`t you glad to see me?

319
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:33,825
Yeah. No!
What are you doing, Raven?

320
00:15:33,859 --> 00:15:36,157
I thought you were still
in prison for armed robbery.

321
00:15:36,195 --> 00:15:38,663
Yeah, well, I was until
I broKe out this morning.

322
00:15:38,697 --> 00:15:40,756
- Ahh! Ahh! Hey!
- Listen.

323
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,232
I need you to get me money.

324
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:43,928
Enough to buy me
a Mexican vacation.

325
00:15:43,969 --> 00:15:45,596
I don`t have any money, Raven.

326
00:15:45,637 --> 00:15:47,104
I Know that, loser.

327
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:48,629
I got a plan,
and I need your help.

328
00:15:48,674 --> 00:15:50,574
Well, whatever your plan is,
I don`t want any part of it.

329
00:15:50,609 --> 00:15:53,942
Shut up. You`re gonna do
exactly what I tell you to do.

330
00:15:53,979 --> 00:15:56,675
You been hearing about this
little boy who got Kidnapped?

331
00:15:56,715 --> 00:15:58,273
- Yeah.
- Well, that`s the plan.

332
00:15:58,317 --> 00:15:59,750
You`re gonna help me
Kidnap some...

333
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:01,343
No, no,
l`m not Kidnapping anybody.

334
00:16:01,386 --> 00:16:05,447
Then you better figure out a way
to turn no dollars into $10,000.

335
00:16:05,491 --> 00:16:08,517
L... $10,000?
There`s no way I can do that.

336
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,961
LooK, if I get caught again,
you`re going down with me...

337
00:16:11,997 --> 00:16:14,966
and we both Know you won`t last
one second in prison.

338
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,490
Raven...

339
00:16:16,535 --> 00:16:19,265
Ten grand, Corey.

340
00:16:19,304 --> 00:16:20,828
L`ll be in touch.

341
00:16:34,353 --> 00:16:35,445
Give me Malcolm.

342
00:16:35,487 --> 00:16:37,614
Hold on.

343
00:16:37,656 --> 00:16:39,988
The bitch is on line one.

344
00:16:40,025 --> 00:16:42,220
Damn it! OK.

345
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:43,523
You want me to stop?

346
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:44,961
Oh, no, baby, Keep going.

347
00:16:44,997 --> 00:16:47,261
Uh, Renee, what`s up?

348
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:49,062
What do you want?

349
00:16:52,204 --> 00:16:53,569
Miss Gladys?

350
00:16:53,605 --> 00:16:56,631
Miss Gladys,
there is nobody on line one!

351
00:16:56,675 --> 00:17:00,202
I thinK I accidentally
hung up on her.

352
00:17:00,245 --> 00:17:02,406
Mmm! Oh, get bacK to worK, baby.

353
00:17:02,447 --> 00:17:04,881
Mmm! Hot damn! Whoo!

354
00:17:10,022 --> 00:17:11,717
Malcolm King`s office.

355
00:17:11,757 --> 00:17:13,918
You hung up on me,
you old witch.

356
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:16,291
Call me that again,
and I will snatch...

357
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:19,263
every bit of faKe hair
out of your nappy head.

358
00:17:19,298 --> 00:17:21,027
Just do your job
and get Malcolm.

359
00:17:21,066 --> 00:17:23,193
Gold-digger. Hold on!

360
00:17:23,235 --> 00:17:25,601
Oh!

361
00:17:25,637 --> 00:17:27,468
She`s on line one.

362
00:17:32,244 --> 00:17:33,939
What do you want, Renee?

363
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:35,503
Ah, there you are.

364
00:17:35,547 --> 00:17:38,448
Must you cancel
all of my credit cards?

365
00:17:38,483 --> 00:17:39,848
What am I supposed
to do for money?

366
00:17:39,885 --> 00:17:42,046
Hell if I care.
Ha ha ha ha ha!

367
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:44,351
That sounds embarrassing.

368
00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:45,913
Where were you
when they canceled...

369
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:49,189
all of your credit cards?
Ha ha ha ha ha!

370
00:17:49,228 --> 00:17:52,391
Ha ha ha.
Laugh all you want to now...

371
00:17:52,431 --> 00:17:55,127
but we`ll see who`s laughing
after the divorce...

372
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:59,126
because my lawyer assured me
that I will be getting...

373
00:17:59,171 --> 00:18:02,004
a very lucrative
divorce settlement...

374
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,304
very lucrative.

375
00:18:04,343 --> 00:18:06,470
At least half, maybe more.

376
00:18:06,511 --> 00:18:09,605
And just liKe sex with you
after two minutes...

377
00:18:09,648 --> 00:18:13,414
this conversation is over.

378
00:18:15,254 --> 00:18:17,222
Ah!

379
00:18:17,256 --> 00:18:19,247
Uh-oh.

380
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,952
I Know he`s gonna
try something slicK...

381
00:18:20,993 --> 00:18:22,984
to get out of paying me.

382
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:34,999
Don`t you have some worK to do?

383
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,270
L`m...

384
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:39,402
finished with the pool.

385
00:18:39,444 --> 00:18:42,413
I wasn`t talKing about...

386
00:18:42,447 --> 00:18:44,278
the pool.

387
00:19:00,198 --> 00:19:04,032
You must thinK that I have
very poor eyesight, Counselor.

388
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:06,663
Your list of marital assets
has several glaring omissions...

389
00:19:06,705 --> 00:19:09,697
most notably,
King Enterprises.

390
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:11,038
And its holdings.

391
00:19:11,076 --> 00:19:13,977
For the one hundredth time,
Anita...

392
00:19:14,012 --> 00:19:15,274
King Enterprises Limited...

393
00:19:15,314 --> 00:19:16,804
is the sole ownership
of Malcolm King...

394
00:19:16,848 --> 00:19:18,611
and I will not...
we will not stand by...

395
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,880
and watch it be broKen up
out of spite.

396
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:23,285
- Your food`s here.
- Oh, thanK you.

397
00:19:23,322 --> 00:19:25,347
Oh, let me guess...

398
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,790
Kung pao chicKen
without vegetables...

399
00:19:27,826 --> 00:19:29,623
not too spicy,
all white meat...

400
00:19:29,661 --> 00:19:31,390
with extra fortune cooKies.

401
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,990
He gets the same thing
all of the time.

402
00:19:34,032 --> 00:19:36,023
Bo... ring.

403
00:19:36,068 --> 00:19:38,696
Can we offer
you ladies anything?

404
00:19:38,737 --> 00:19:41,228
No, thanK you.
L`m not hungry.

405
00:19:41,273 --> 00:19:43,173
Oh, hell.

406
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,301
Why don`t I just taKe half
of Malcolm`s food anyway?

407
00:19:45,344 --> 00:19:46,504
Note that.

408
00:19:46,545 --> 00:19:49,105
LooK, Counselor,
Renee has been with Malcolm...

409
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:50,944
since the very beginning
of King Enterprises...

410
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:53,177
and deserves a half a share
of the company.

411
00:19:53,218 --> 00:19:55,345
- What?
- Hell, I deserve all of it.

412
00:19:55,387 --> 00:19:57,912
- You said so yourself.
- When?

413
00:19:57,956 --> 00:19:59,355
Find that little thing.

414
00:19:59,391 --> 00:20:01,325
Please.

415
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:03,792
Ah, here is it.

416
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:05,421
``My dearest Renee...

417
00:20:05,464 --> 00:20:08,831
``everything I have built,
I built for you.

418
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:10,630
``Love always, Malcolm. ``

419
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:12,330
Ooh. Poetry.

420
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:14,236
It`s a greeting card, man.

421
00:20:14,272 --> 00:20:15,796
I was drunK when I wrote it...

422
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,604
and she was butt-naKed
on the floor. What?

423
00:20:17,642 --> 00:20:20,338
We are seeKing
the primary residence...

424
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:21,744
as well as
one of the vacation homes.

425
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,772
L`ve already gone ahead and
had the laKe house appraised.

426
00:20:24,816 --> 00:20:26,181
The details are inside.

427
00:20:31,456 --> 00:20:33,822
Now, as far as
preliminary meetings go...

428
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,156
it wasn`t so bad.

429
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:36,353
I need that money, Anita.

430
00:20:36,395 --> 00:20:38,124
This hair does not grow
on trees.

431
00:20:38,163 --> 00:20:40,222
Hello?

432
00:20:40,265 --> 00:20:41,789
Hi. Hi, Mrs. King.

433
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,233
LooKs liKe we`re gonna have
to do this the hard way.

434
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:45,429
You Know, l`m just gonna
call you Renee.

435
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,596
No, you won`t.

436
00:20:46,638 --> 00:20:49,539
What?
Well, this is disastrous.

437
00:20:49,574 --> 00:20:51,041
What`s wrong?

438
00:20:51,076 --> 00:20:53,306
Another divorce case that l`ve
been worKing on for months...

439
00:20:53,345 --> 00:20:55,006
but my client
neglected to tell me...

440
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,536
that she has been having
an affair.

441
00:20:56,581 --> 00:20:57,775
Mm-hmm.

442
00:20:57,816 --> 00:21:00,046
And guess what?
The judge found out.

443
00:21:00,085 --> 00:21:02,144
I sure hope
the sex was worth it...

444
00:21:02,187 --> 00:21:05,714
because she just cost
herself millions.

445
00:21:05,757 --> 00:21:07,224
Ooh.

446
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:09,750
So, you just gonna let them
waltz outta here liKe that, huh?

447
00:21:09,795 --> 00:21:12,263
I can`t maKe them
taKe our offer, Malcolm.

448
00:21:12,297 --> 00:21:14,993
Listen... listen to me.
There is a very real chance...

449
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:17,763
Renee could walK out of this
with half of King Enterprises.

450
00:21:17,803 --> 00:21:19,498
That... that valentine
was brilliant, man.

451
00:21:19,538 --> 00:21:22,473
David. David!

452
00:21:22,507 --> 00:21:24,566
I will handle it myself.

453
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:26,804
Malcolm, I Know that looK.

454
00:21:26,845 --> 00:21:30,941
I Know that...
Do not do anything crazy.

455
00:21:30,982 --> 00:21:32,347
Do not.

456
00:21:32,384 --> 00:21:35,285
ThanKs for nothing, David.
See yourself out.

457
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,947
Malcolm.

458
00:21:36,988 --> 00:21:38,751
Malcolm.

459
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,758
Malcolm!

460
00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:45,762
OK, let me
rocK you steady, ma

461
00:21:45,797 --> 00:21:48,197
Dollars don`t fall, man,
it`s not confetti

462
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:50,531
This ain`t a punchline,
battle rhyme, lunch line

463
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:52,764
This is just to get you
twistin` up your body one time

464
00:21:52,804 --> 00:21:54,795
If not one time,
do it two

465
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:58,507
One, two, three, shoot.

466
00:21:58,543 --> 00:22:00,272
Sorry.

467
00:22:01,746 --> 00:22:03,441
- Oh.
- Oh, thanK you.

468
00:22:03,482 --> 00:22:05,814
- Andre, right?
- Yeah.

469
00:22:05,851 --> 00:22:08,649
Oh, good.
I need to asK you a favor.

470
00:22:08,687 --> 00:22:10,177
Whassup, whassup, whassup?

471
00:22:10,222 --> 00:22:12,315
Oh, well, oh...

472
00:22:12,357 --> 00:22:16,817
I was hoping you could wax this
real good for me...

473
00:22:16,862 --> 00:22:19,387
and try not
to leave any scratches.

474
00:22:19,431 --> 00:22:22,025
Hey, well, you Know,
whatever you`re into, baby.

475
00:22:22,067 --> 00:22:23,898
So, you`re gonna hooK me up?

476
00:22:23,935 --> 00:22:25,402
Hell, yes.

477
00:22:25,437 --> 00:22:28,634
Oh! Ha ha ha!
You`re so sweet.

478
00:22:28,673 --> 00:22:31,107
Um, l`ll call and set up
a time with you later.

479
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:32,541
And don`t worry.

480
00:22:32,577 --> 00:22:34,738
L`ll definitely
maKe it worth your while.

481
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:37,407
Oh. Mwah.

482
00:22:37,449 --> 00:22:39,940
ThanK you.
Hee hee hee hee!

483
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:41,953
Keys, Keys.

484
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:43,955
Oh!

485
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:45,650
I forgot.

486
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,660
Yo!

487
00:22:52,063 --> 00:22:54,759
- Oh, Andre?
- Yes.

488
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,892
Are my stripes crooKed?

489
00:22:56,935 --> 00:22:59,199
9:15.

490
00:22:59,237 --> 00:23:02,365
Oh! ThanK you.

491
00:23:02,407 --> 00:23:04,841
My rump shaKe`s
in demand

492
00:23:04,876 --> 00:23:06,400
I Know you liKe it,
watch your hand

493
00:23:06,444 --> 00:23:08,537
Whoo! Ha ha ha ha!

494
00:23:10,315 --> 00:23:11,441
Yes, I can

495
00:23:11,483 --> 00:23:13,280
Somebody parK the car.

496
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,757
Good morning, Miss Gladys.

497
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,692
Good morning.
Oh, you made the front page.

498
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:25,056
What?

499
00:23:25,096 --> 00:23:27,257
Mm-hmm.

500
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:31,028
That little punK.

501
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:33,128
He told me
this wasn`t supposed to run...

502
00:23:33,171 --> 00:23:34,695
until a weeK from Sunday.

503
00:23:34,739 --> 00:23:36,832
This is just gonna give
Renee more ammo...

504
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,604
and my blacK ass is the target.

505
00:23:43,982 --> 00:23:45,643
Malcolm King.

506
00:23:45,684 --> 00:23:51,782
Cha-ching, cha-ching,
cha-ching.

507
00:23:51,823 --> 00:23:53,848
Good-bye.

508
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,120
Heh heh heh heh.

509
00:23:57,195 --> 00:23:58,753
Ohh.

510
00:23:58,797 --> 00:24:00,958
Oh, my God. What`d she say?

511
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:03,263
Oh, my God!
Malcolm, Malcolm, stop that!

512
00:24:03,301 --> 00:24:04,666
Malcolm!

513
00:24:04,703 --> 00:24:06,432
Pull yourself together now.
Straighten up.

514
00:24:07,806 --> 00:24:10,798
L`ll be in my office.

515
00:24:17,782 --> 00:24:20,307
Be the burger.

516
00:24:24,723 --> 00:24:26,691
What`s up, bro?

517
00:24:30,362 --> 00:24:33,024
Get a real job!

518
00:24:36,134 --> 00:24:37,829
ThinK fast.

519
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:39,996
Corey, buddy.

520
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:41,903
Mind if I join you?

521
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,636
You Know, son,
they say with great power...

522
00:24:44,676 --> 00:24:46,541
comes great responsibility.

523
00:24:46,578 --> 00:24:50,309
Oh, sure, everyone thinKs being
shift manager is all glory.

524
00:24:50,348 --> 00:24:52,316
And it is.

525
00:24:53,418 --> 00:24:54,715
But there are also times...

526
00:24:54,753 --> 00:24:56,880
when l`m forced to maKe
the tough calls...

527
00:24:56,921 --> 00:25:00,049

And this just in.

644

Finally, a happy ending

645
00:30:46,404 --> 00:30:47,871
of little MarK Wilson.

646

He was safely returned
to his parents...

647
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,235
Oh, shut up.

648
00:30:51,275 --> 00:30:52,572
After they conceded
to the Kidnappers` demands...

649
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:55,044
and paid
a $5-million ransom.

650
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:56,808
Still, the Kidnappers
remain at large...

651
00:30:56,848 --> 00:30:59,646
and authorities have few leads.

652
00:30:59,684 --> 00:31:01,413
You Know, Bill,
that`s a lot of money.

653
00:31:01,452 --> 00:31:03,818
Huh. Damn right, it is.

654
00:31:09,961 --> 00:31:14,022
That`s it. That`s it.
I Know what we`re gonna do.

655
00:31:14,065 --> 00:31:16,033
I Know what we`re gonna do.

00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:26,174
That`s right.
I want you to Kidnap his ass.

660
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,678
But why would you
Kidnap yourself?

661
00:31:28,713 --> 00:31:31,181
To Keep Renee
from getting my money.

662
00:31:31,215 --> 00:31:33,410
Just in case
this divorce settlement...

663
00:31:33,451 --> 00:31:35,112
does not worK out in my favor...

664
00:31:35,153 --> 00:31:38,953
I want to maKe sure
that I get some money.

665
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,218
And you Know
what the best part is?

666
00:31:40,258 --> 00:31:42,886
- What?

00:31:42,927 --> 00:31:45,191
- You want to Know why?
- Why?

668
00:31:45,229 --> 00:31:48,289
Because l`m gonna hire
the man to Kidnap me myself.

669
00:31:48,332 --> 00:31:51,859
Oh. Ooh, Malcolm,
you`re a genius.

670
00:31:51,903 --> 00:31:53,928
Have you lost your mind?

671
00:31:53,971 --> 00:31:56,098
- No.
- Angela DraKe...

672
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,631
Someone has got to teach
Malcolm King a lesson.

673
00:31:58,676 --> 00:32:01,440
I mean, he can`t Keep
treating people liKe dirt.

674
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:05,245
In fact,

Damn.

00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:14,282
There`ll be witnesses there.

679
00:32:14,325 --> 00:32:15,724
But what if they see
everything?

680
00:32:18,262 --> 00:32:20,594
That way, it will looK real.

681
00:32:20,631 --> 00:32:24,499
Oh. I thinK I got it.

682
00:32:24,535 --> 00:32:27,003

Caught?
We`re not getting caught.

685
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:33,605

692
00:32:50,862 --> 00:32:52,830

693
00:32:52,864 --> 00:32:55,355

We`ll tie his hands,
we`ll tie his feet...

700
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,577
and we`ll jiggle him.

701
00:33:10,615 --> 00:33:12,674
We`ll just shaKe
all that blubber...

702
00:33:12,717 --> 00:33:15,015
and we`ll just maKe him beg.

703
00:33:15,052 --> 00:33:17,714
Tomorrow...

704
00:33:17,755 --> 00:33:20,121
Malcolm King...

705
00:33:21,392 --> 00:33:24,225
is getting Kidnapped.

706
00:33:24,262 --> 00:33:26,059
Capisce?

707
00:33:29,433 --> 00:33:32,163
L`ll see you tomorrow night,
Malcolm King.

708
00:33:32,203 --> 00:33:34,034
Ha ha ha! Fun.

709
00:33:34,071 --> 00:33:37,006
Oh! Aah!

710
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:43,375
Malcolm, baby, come to bed.

711
00:33:43,414 --> 00:33:46,542
Uh-uh. Not right now, baby.
L`m almost finished.

712
00:33:46,584 --> 00:33:49,849
L`m almost finished.

713
00:33:49,887 --> 00:33:53,015
Ah. Not for nothing, baby...

714
00:33:53,057 --> 00:33:56,185
this has got to be
the best Kidnapping plan ever.

715
00:33:56,227 --> 00:33:59,526
Hmm. LooK at this.

716
00:33:59,564 --> 00:34:02,260
L`ll be last seen
at around 11:00 P.M., right?

717
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,858
Mmm.

718
00:34:03,901 --> 00:34:06,529
OK, l`ll be bacK
in a minute. Ha ha ha!

719
00:34:06,571 --> 00:34:08,869
Oh, and then l`m grabbed
outside the benefit at 11:00.

720
00:34:08,906 --> 00:34:10,897
LooK, you see that? Boom, right?

721
00:34:10,942 --> 00:34:13,103
And then l`m taKen
to the secret location.

722
00:34:13,144 --> 00:34:15,044
Now, just to throw people off...

723
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:18,742
a ransom note will be sent
to my gold-digging wife...

724
00:34:18,783 --> 00:34:21,775
demanding $10 million
for my safe return.

725
00:34:21,819 --> 00:34:23,912
Uh-huh. And it`s gonna contain
all the usual stuff.

726
00:34:23,955 --> 00:34:25,582
You Know,
don`t contact the police...

727
00:34:25,623 --> 00:34:27,386
or the media...
blah, blah, blah...

728
00:34:27,425 --> 00:34:28,949
because if you do,
we`re gonna Kill him.

729
00:34:28,993 --> 00:34:31,427
Hmm. Yes. Now looK at Renee.

730
00:34:31,462 --> 00:34:32,759
When she hears this...

731
00:34:32,797 --> 00:34:34,094
she probably
gonna start celebrating.

732
00:34:34,131 --> 00:34:37,692
Then she`ll remember
that I cut her out of my will.

733
00:34:37,735 --> 00:34:38,827
Ooh!

734
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:40,962
And then it sinKs in.

735
00:34:41,005 --> 00:34:43,735
No Malcolm, no money.

736
00:34:43,774 --> 00:34:44,934
- Ha ha!
- Wow.

737
00:34:44,976 --> 00:34:47,308
So now she has
to call the only person...

738
00:34:47,345 --> 00:34:51,042
that has access to my money.
Bam! Miss Gladys.

739
00:34:51,082 --> 00:34:53,073
And you Know Miss Gladys
would never let...

740
00:34:53,117 --> 00:34:55,608
a hair on my pretty little
head be harmed. Ha ha!

741
00:34:55,653 --> 00:34:58,281
So, Miss Gladys maKes the drop.

742
00:34:58,322 --> 00:35:01,655
Ooh. Ooh. Hmm.
This is my favorite part, baby.

743
00:35:01,692 --> 00:35:04,661
Renee... how she lives afterwards.

744
00:35:04,695 --> 00:35:08,256
She slides into
a soul-deadening spiral...

745
00:35:08,299 --> 00:35:10,767
into the bottom of
the deep bowels of the earth.

746
00:35:10,801 --> 00:35:12,769
LooK, and then
she livin` in Tent City...

747
00:35:12,803 --> 00:35:15,203
by the freeway in L.A.
By the Staples Center.

748
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,831
That`s her living in a tent.
LooK at her.

749
00:35:16,874 --> 00:35:19,434
LooK at her, looK at her.
LooK at her.

750
00:35:19,477 --> 00:35:20,944
It`s flawless, baby.

751
00:35:20,978 --> 00:35:22,343
It`s... it`s amazing.

752
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,814
- Except...
- Except what?

753
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:26,373
Except...

754
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:30,376
I need somebody to actually
grab me outside of the benefit.

755
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:33,982
Somebody that the police
could never connect me to.

756
00:35:34,025 --> 00:35:35,287
Mmm.

757
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:40,663
A disposable dumb-ass
to taKe the dive.

758
00:35:40,698 --> 00:35:42,063
But who?

759
00:35:44,402 --> 00:35:46,097
What about my brother?

760
00:35:46,137 --> 00:35:48,264
Huh?

761
00:35:48,306 --> 00:35:51,605
L`m picKing him up tomorrow.
He could use the worK.

762
00:35:51,642 --> 00:35:53,940
He`s had trouble
holding down jobs in the past.

763
00:35:53,978 --> 00:35:56,276
Heh. Your brother.

764
00:35:56,314 --> 00:35:57,838
What`s he liKe?

765
00:35:57,882 --> 00:36:00,578
Oh, he`s... he`s super-smart.

766
00:36:00,618 --> 00:36:02,882
He`s a real sweetheart.
Everyone loves him.

767
00:36:04,055 --> 00:36:05,613
Nothin` can stop me now

768
00:36:05,656 --> 00:36:07,783
ClicK-clacK,
then all you hear is pow...

769
00:36:07,825 --> 00:36:09,520
Heh.

770
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,891
Ahh.

771
00:36:10,928 --> 00:36:13,362
Call me the riser
`cause I stay with the heat

772
00:36:13,397 --> 00:36:15,991
lmagine, if you will,
your worst nightmare

773
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:18,968
Mobbin` through your hood,
your life is in danger

774
00:36:19,003 --> 00:36:21,699
lmagine, if you will,
your worst nightmare

775
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:24,708
Bang on the catwalK,
slicK with the gun talK

776
00:36:29,046 --> 00:36:30,240
Oh! Guess what?

777
00:36:30,281 --> 00:36:31,839
I got a way
you can maKe some big money...

778
00:36:31,882 --> 00:36:33,440
but it`s a top-secret plan...

779
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:36,044
which means
you can`t tell anyone.

780
00:36:53,704 --> 00:36:56,571
So, it`s too bad
your Mercedes got stolen...

781
00:36:56,607 --> 00:36:58,438
and we had
to taKe a cab tonight.

782
00:36:58,476 --> 00:36:59,670
I Know, right?

783
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:02,178
ThanKs for paying for it.
Appreciate that.

784
00:37:02,213 --> 00:37:04,078
LooK, when
we`re in this party...

785
00:37:04,115 --> 00:37:06,242
a lot of people in there
gonna be calling me Andre...

786
00:37:06,283 --> 00:37:07,443
and that`s because, you Know...

787
00:37:07,485 --> 00:37:09,749
I tell my employees,
``Call me Andre. ``

788
00:37:09,787 --> 00:37:11,345
I don`t liKe my employees
calling me Malcolm.

789
00:37:11,389 --> 00:37:12,549
I understand.

790
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,751
You can`t let your employees
get too familiar.

791
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:17,488
- You are so smart.
- ThanK you very much.

792
00:37:17,528 --> 00:37:20,088

00:37:24,402 --> 00:37:25,562
Hell, yeah.

796
00:37:25,603 --> 00:37:28,538
Oh, good. Well, I Know
we already set up a time...

797
00:37:28,572 --> 00:37:33,373
but I was hoping we could do it
a little bit sooner.

798
00:37:33,411 --> 00:37:35,379
You just tell me when,
and l`ll be ready.

799
00:37:35,413 --> 00:37:37,244
Oh! I love him!

800
00:37:37,281 --> 00:37:38,976

00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,129
Ahem.

00:38:00,337 --> 00:38:01,565
Hello?

811
00:38:03,174 --> 00:38:04,436

Am I crazy? Huh?

819
00:38:20,524 --> 00:38:23,322
Am I some crazy lady
standing out here, crazy?

820
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,089
Seeing things
that didn`t really happen?

821
00:38:25,129 --> 00:38:26,721
Is that the problem?
You Know what?

822
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:28,197
Don`t even say anything.
You Know why?

823
00:38:28,232 --> 00:38:30,792

You can`t handle this anyway.

Oh, Malcolm... Malcolm King?

00:41:21,205 --> 00:41:22,536

Don`t screw this up, Byron.

Enjoy the party, ladies.

880
00:41:30,681 --> 00:41:33,309
All right.
Hey, brother, have fun, man.

881
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,841
Byron!
You better stop that limo.

882
00:41:35,886 --> 00:41:37,911
He called for a limo.
I am not playing with you.

883
00:41:37,955 --> 00:41:39,047
Mmm.

884
00:41:39,089 --> 00:41:40,522
Uhh!

885
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,987
Where the hell is the limo?

886
00:41:50,167 --> 00:41:51,998
Hey, you all right?

887
00:41:52,036 --> 00:41:54,095
You OK?

888
00:41:56,774 --> 00:41:59,299
D-d-d-d-don`t m-m-m-move.

889
00:42:07,651 --> 00:42:08,811
Ow!

890
00:42:08,852 --> 00:42:12,219
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!

891
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,419

00:42:20,464 --> 00:42:21,863

893
00:42:21,899 --> 00:42:23,890

OK, l`m ready.

00:42:25,269 --> 00:42:26,702
- OK. You all set?

896
00:42:26,737 --> 00:42:27,761
What is that?

897
00:42:27,805 --> 00:42:29,705
Oh, I brought this
because I thought...

898
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,230
we could maybe use it
for something.

899
00:42:31,275 --> 00:42:33,072
No. What in the hell
are you wearing?!

900
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:36,079
Angela, you told me
to wear all blacK.

901
00:42:36,113 --> 00:42:37,341
You did say that.

902
00:42:37,381 --> 00:42:39,906
No. Everybody Knows
she loves Jesus.

903
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:42,783
Put this on.
He`s gonna Know it`s you.

904
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,913
- There he is.
- Oh. There`s the limo.

00:42:50,461 --> 00:42:52,088

Enjoy the party, ladies.

00:43:04,641 --> 00:43:05,869

00:43:08,078 --> 00:43:09,568
Excuse me.

910
00:43:09,613 --> 00:43:10,875
Pardon me.

911
00:43:10,914 --> 00:43:12,575
Where the hell you been, man?

912
00:43:12,616 --> 00:43:14,811

913
00:43:14,852 --> 00:43:16,217

915
00:43:17,921 --> 00:43:19,980
Sh-shut up and g-g-get in.

916
00:43:20,023 --> 00:43:23,254
Oh. Oh, I see.
That`s a good touch, man.

917
00:43:23,293 --> 00:43:25,261
You want people
to see me get Kidnapped.

918
00:43:25,295 --> 00:43:26,819
OK, hold on, hold on, hold on.

919
00:43:28,332 --> 00:43:31,130
Help! Help!
L`m being Kidnapped!

920
00:43:31,168 --> 00:43:32,430
Open the door.

921
00:43:32,469 --> 00:43:34,596
Open the door, stupid.

00:43:36,106 --> 00:43:38,301

OK, they`re on the move.

927
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,349
They`re on the move, ladies.
This is it.

928
00:43:51,388 --> 00:43:53,413
Here we go, here we go,

929
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:10,406
Man, what happened
out there, huh?

930
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,771
You almost blew it.

931
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:14,778
And what happened
to the chloroform?!

932
00:44:14,812 --> 00:44:16,336
Mm...

933
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,177
But the gun...

934
00:44:18,215 --> 00:44:22,015
Ahh, the gun was a nice touch.
Ha ha ha ha ha!

935
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,681
Now taKe me to the hotel.
My blacK ass is tired.

936
00:44:26,723 --> 00:44:28,020

00:44:34,932 --> 00:44:36,024
JerK.

00:44:36,733 --> 00:44:38,132

00:44:52,182 --> 00:44:54,241
Ha ha ha ha ha!

947
00:44:54,284 --> 00:44:56,411
Ah ha ha ha ha!

948
00:44:56,453 --> 00:44:57,818
Whoo!

949
00:44:57,855 --> 00:45:01,382
I love it when
a plan comes together.

950
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,152
Ahh!

951
00:45:05,195 --> 00:45:07,925
That`s what
l`m talKin` about. Mmm!

952
00:45:07,965 --> 00:45:10,092
Best of both worlds,
let me Kiss on it, uh

953
00:45:10,133 --> 00:45:12,624
After that, l`m gonna
lay you down flat...

954
00:45:17,374 --> 00:45:19,501
That little tricK,
with your tongue ring

955
00:45:21,912 --> 00:45:23,174
What the...

956
00:45:25,215 --> 00:45:26,876
N-n-n-no!

957
00:45:31,321 --> 00:45:34,222
Hey, s-s-stutter box!

958
00:45:34,258 --> 00:45:36,590
What the hell
are we stopping here for, huh?

959
00:45:38,562 --> 00:45:41,690
Perfect. Everything`s
going according to plan.

960
00:45:41,732 --> 00:45:43,029
You did that?

961
00:45:43,066 --> 00:45:46,058
Yeah. I tinKered
with the engine a little bit.

962
00:45:46,103 --> 00:45:49,766
Hey! Hey! LooK, man,
I ain`t got all night...

963
00:45:49,806 --> 00:45:51,706
to be sittin` out here on
the side of the road with you!

964
00:45:51,742 --> 00:45:53,403
Get me to the Terrance Hotel!

965
00:45:53,443 --> 00:45:55,934
Didn`t want to do this...

966
00:46:03,854 --> 00:46:05,048
Huh?

967
00:46:06,623 --> 00:46:08,921
Stop what you`re doing.
Get in the trunK.

968
00:46:08,959 --> 00:46:10,483
Get in the trunK!

969
00:46:10,527 --> 00:46:11,892
But... but... but... but...

970
00:46:11,929 --> 00:46:14,659
No, no!

971
00:46:16,133 --> 00:46:18,124
Hey, what`s the holdup?

972
00:46:19,703 --> 00:46:21,796
Are you deaf?
What`s the holdup?

973
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:23,601
Get out of the car, jacKass!

974
00:46:25,242 --> 00:46:28,143
Ain`t gonna be too many more of
those jacKasses, all right?

975
00:46:28,178 --> 00:46:29,839
And what`s up with this masK
all of a sudden?

976
00:46:31,481 --> 00:46:32,914
Oh, I get it.

977
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:34,918
I see.
We`re switching vehicles...

978
00:46:34,952 --> 00:46:37,250
just in case
we were being followed.

979
00:46:37,287 --> 00:46:40,313
And the masK is
so nobody can identify you.

980
00:46:40,357 --> 00:46:42,917
Oh! Smart. That`s smart!

981
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,451
Damn, y`all planned
this out good!

982
00:46:46,663 --> 00:46:49,291
OK, who the hell are they, huh?

983
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:50,994
Let me maKe something clear,
all right?

984
00:46:51,034 --> 00:46:52,661
I don`t care
what y`all talKed about...

985
00:46:52,703 --> 00:46:54,170
but I ain`t payin` y`all
no more money.

986
00:46:54,204 --> 00:46:56,001
So whatever

987
00:46:56,039 --> 00:46:57,597
y`all just gonna have
to split three ways.

988
00:46:57,641 --> 00:46:59,006
Hey.

989
00:46:59,042 --> 00:47:00,805
Hey. Come on, give me this.

990
00:47:00,844 --> 00:47:02,334
Oh!

991
00:47:02,379 --> 00:47:03,903
Now, come on,
everybody get in the car.

992
00:47:03,947 --> 00:47:05,346
I got to go.

993
00:47:06,883 --> 00:47:09,511
Move your asses! I got to go!

994
00:47:12,723 --> 00:47:15,487
Help! He-help!

995
00:47:35,178 --> 00:47:37,703
Oh! Ooh!

996
00:47:41,852 --> 00:47:44,412
Aaaaaah!

997
00:47:44,454 --> 00:47:46,319
Aaah!

998
00:47:46,356 --> 00:47:47,516
Aaah!

999
00:47:54,798 --> 00:47:56,493
Ohh.

1000
00:47:56,533 --> 00:47:58,433
Ohh.

1001
00:48:08,912 --> 00:48:10,675
Oh! Ooh.

1002
00:48:10,714 --> 00:48:12,614
Are you all right, Mr. King?

1003
00:48:14,418 --> 00:48:15,908
Nighty-night.

1004
00:48:15,952 --> 00:48:17,419
Hey, what`s going on here?

1005
00:48:17,454 --> 00:48:20,446
One second. There you go. Ohh!

1006
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:22,924
What in God`s name
is going on here?

1007
00:48:22,959 --> 00:48:24,950
You`ve made a mistaKe, sir.
That`s our property.

1008
00:48:24,995 --> 00:48:26,053
LooK. All right?

1009
00:48:26,096 --> 00:48:28,257
- Aah!
- Oh! OK.

1010
00:48:28,298 --> 00:48:29,788
I don`t want
to hurt anybody, honest.

1011
00:48:29,833 --> 00:48:31,027
I just want him.

1012
00:48:31,068 --> 00:48:32,035
- Yeah.
- OK.

1013
00:48:32,069 --> 00:48:34,264
Go around, hop in.

1014
00:48:41,078 --> 00:48:43,706
Oh, we`re going to hell.

1015
00:48:43,747 --> 00:48:45,009
Ooh!

1016
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:54,650
Hello?

1017
00:48:54,691 --> 00:48:56,921
Condoleezza,
J-Jesse JacKson...

1018
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,360
Colin Powell
showed up and... and...

1019
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:01,523
I lost him.
L`m sorry, l`m sorry.

1020
00:49:01,565 --> 00:49:03,396
What do you mean,
you l-lost him?

1021
00:49:03,433 --> 00:49:06,163
- L... l...
- How did you l-lose him?

1022
00:49:06,203 --> 00:49:08,137
B-b-b-but l`m sorry,
l`m sorry, l`m sorry.

1023
00:49:08,171 --> 00:49:09,433
Where are you?

1024
00:49:09,473 --> 00:49:11,441
L-locKed in the limo trunK.

1025
00:49:11,475 --> 00:49:12,772
Where the hell is he?!

1026
00:49:22,686 --> 00:49:25,280
Come on. It`s OK.
It`s all right.

1027
00:49:25,322 --> 00:49:28,485
Watch your Knees. All right.

1028
00:49:28,525 --> 00:49:30,459
There you go. Come on. Whoa.

1029
00:49:30,494 --> 00:49:32,223
Careful. There you go.

1030
00:49:32,262 --> 00:49:35,561
Come on. OK. All right.

1031
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:36,930
Where am I, man, huh?

1032
00:49:36,967 --> 00:49:38,093
You`re at my house.

1033
00:49:38,135 --> 00:49:39,864
Hey, hey. Who... who are you?

1034
00:49:39,903 --> 00:49:42,235
Whew. Oh, what am I doing?

1035
00:49:42,272 --> 00:49:44,763
I don`t have the heart for this.
Man, l`m no Kidnapper.

1036
00:49:44,808 --> 00:49:46,139
Well, hell, man...

1037
00:49:46,176 --> 00:49:48,838
I don`t have experience
in Kidnapping, either.

1038
00:49:48,879 --> 00:49:51,473
And your sister never told me
you were so recKless.

1039
00:49:51,515 --> 00:49:53,779
Oh, wait a minute.
You Know my sister?

1040
00:49:56,086 --> 00:49:58,816
Wait, wait. Know her?

1041
00:49:58,855 --> 00:50:00,755
- L`m sleeping with her.
- Eww.

1042
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:02,018
She was the one
that helped me...

1043
00:50:02,058 --> 00:50:04,549
come up with this plan
for you to Kidnap me.

1044
00:50:07,998 --> 00:50:12,264
You`re the dude
with the jacKed-up shoes.

1045
00:50:12,302 --> 00:50:13,530
Ha ha ha ha!

1046
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:15,162
Ha ha.

1047
00:50:15,205 --> 00:50:16,570
Oh, my God.

1048
00:50:16,606 --> 00:50:18,733
You tooK my plan
to a whole `nother level, man.

1049
00:50:18,775 --> 00:50:20,265
- I did?
- Yeah.

1050
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:22,369
Hey, the way you came
to my job and cased it.

1051
00:50:22,412 --> 00:50:23,572
Right.

1052
00:50:23,613 --> 00:50:25,877
And the masKs.
And the... and the...

1053
00:50:25,916 --> 00:50:28,976
and the switching of the cars.

1054
00:50:30,287 --> 00:50:31,686
Ohh.

1055
00:50:31,721 --> 00:50:34,189
Oh, man!
And then bringing me...

1056
00:50:34,224 --> 00:50:36,249
to this hole-in-the-wall
cracKhouse.

1057
00:50:36,293 --> 00:50:38,193
Yeah, man. `cause
they would`ve recognized me...

1058
00:50:38,228 --> 00:50:39,695
down at the Terrance Hotel.

1059
00:50:39,729 --> 00:50:41,526
Man, this was smart
bringing me here.

1060
00:50:41,565 --> 00:50:43,692
`Cause, hell, nobody`s gonna
recognize me here.

1061
00:50:43,733 --> 00:50:44,825
Well...

1062
00:50:44,868 --> 00:50:47,063
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1063
00:50:47,103 --> 00:50:48,263
Heh heh.

1064
00:50:48,305 --> 00:50:51,103
Your sister was right, man.
You are smart.

1065
00:50:51,141 --> 00:50:54,167
My sister said that about me?

1066
00:50:54,211 --> 00:50:56,372
Wait, wait. Hold it.

1067
00:50:58,315 --> 00:51:00,476
- You`re white.
- Yeah.

1068
00:51:00,517 --> 00:51:02,747
- But your sister is...
- She`s adopted.

1069
00:51:02,786 --> 00:51:05,687
My grandmother adopted her
when I was two years old.

1070
00:51:05,722 --> 00:51:07,280
Oh.

1071
00:51:11,995 --> 00:51:14,623
Shh. That`s my grandma.

1072
00:51:14,664 --> 00:51:16,962
L`ll handle this.

1073
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,194
Stay there.

1074
00:51:25,942 --> 00:51:27,967
You`re gonna
burn this place down...

1075
00:51:28,011 --> 00:51:30,411
you deaf old hag.
She`s deaf.

1076
00:51:30,447 --> 00:51:33,439
I unplug this,
she doesn`t hear a thing.

1077
00:51:33,483 --> 00:51:37,249
Raaaaar!

1078
00:51:37,287 --> 00:51:39,346
Raaah! Ha ha ha!
Lt`s Kind of funny.

1079
00:51:39,389 --> 00:51:41,289
And sad.

1080
00:51:46,263 --> 00:51:48,458
L`ll show you my spot.

1081
00:52:00,944 --> 00:52:02,605
Ah.

1082
00:52:07,183 --> 00:52:09,310
You live down here?

1083
00:52:09,352 --> 00:52:10,614
Yeah.

1084
00:52:13,189 --> 00:52:15,623
Tch. Pathetic.

1085
00:52:15,659 --> 00:52:17,684
You`re a grown man...

1086
00:52:17,727 --> 00:52:20,890
and you live in
your grandmother`s basement?

1087
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:23,125
L`m saving up
for my own place, you Know?

1088
00:52:23,166 --> 00:52:24,929
What the hell is this?

1089
00:52:24,968 --> 00:52:26,902
Lt`s my birdhouse.

1090
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:29,496
- You made this yourself?
- Yes, I did.

1091
00:52:29,539 --> 00:52:31,268
- On purpose?
- Yeah.

1092
00:52:31,308 --> 00:52:34,436
What, you did it
drunK and blindfolded?

1093
00:52:34,477 --> 00:52:35,774
No.

1094
00:52:35,812 --> 00:52:39,077
Damn. Hey, you Know what?
Don`t even worry about that...

1095
00:52:39,115 --> 00:52:41,948
because with the money
l`m paying you for this...

1096
00:52:41,985 --> 00:52:44,476
you`ll be able to afford
your own place.

1097
00:52:44,521 --> 00:52:47,285
Your sister did tell you
you`re getting paid for this?

1098
00:52:47,324 --> 00:52:49,952
No, not exact...
Not exactly, you Know?

1099
00:52:49,993 --> 00:52:51,824
We didn`t... we didn`t
really discuss it.

1100
00:52:51,861 --> 00:52:53,123
Uh...

1101
00:52:53,163 --> 00:52:56,929
I have to be honest with you.
L`m really confused.

1102
00:52:56,966 --> 00:52:59,696
Heh. Yeah, I can see that.

1103
00:52:59,736 --> 00:53:01,931
L`m surprised
you even Know my sister.

1104
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:03,700
My sister came up
with this plan?

1105
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:06,038
How do you guys even Know
each other again?

1106
00:53:06,076 --> 00:53:09,512
LooK, I Know it`s hard
for you to believe, man...

1107
00:53:09,546 --> 00:53:14,040
especially considering
how dumb your sister really is.

1108
00:53:14,084 --> 00:53:15,244
- Yeah.
- Ha ha ha!

1109
00:53:15,285 --> 00:53:17,480
Hey, hey,
but every once in a while...

1110
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,886
she`ll say something
that`s not dipped in stupid.

1111
00:53:19,923 --> 00:53:21,083
Right.

1112
00:53:21,124 --> 00:53:22,716
And coming up
with this plan with me...

1113
00:53:22,759 --> 00:53:24,818
was one of those times.

1114
00:53:24,861 --> 00:53:26,453
This where I sleep?

1115
00:53:28,365 --> 00:53:30,094
Uhh.

1116
00:53:30,133 --> 00:53:31,794
Ooh.

1117
00:53:52,088 --> 00:53:54,147
Whassup?

1118
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:56,090
Whassup?

1119
00:53:59,129 --> 00:54:02,223
Uhh.

1120
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,060
Whassup?

1121
00:54:05,101 --> 00:54:06,363
Aaaaah!

1122
00:54:06,403 --> 00:54:07,802
- Hey, hey.
- Oh! No!

1123
00:54:07,837 --> 00:54:10,237
- Who are you, and what are you...
- Calm down.

1124
00:54:10,273 --> 00:54:12,036
Just tell me where I am!
No, no!

1125
00:54:12,075 --> 00:54:13,906
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, hey, hey!

1126
00:54:13,943 --> 00:54:15,570
Calm down.

1127
00:54:15,612 --> 00:54:16,909
L`m calm.

1128
00:54:16,946 --> 00:54:18,971
Now, you don`t want me
to get upset.

1129
00:54:23,086 --> 00:54:25,418
I must`ve used
too much chloroform.

1130
00:54:25,455 --> 00:54:28,424
You`re in the Terrance Hotel.

1131
00:54:29,759 --> 00:54:33,593
Behind you over there
is some lobster.

1132
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:36,497
Some fill-ett mig-non
over there...

1133
00:54:36,533 --> 00:54:39,161
some champagne.

1134
00:54:39,202 --> 00:54:42,069
Right here we got
some Cuban cigars rolled up...

1135
00:54:42,105 --> 00:54:44,665
just liKe
my sister Peaches told me.

1136
00:54:46,242 --> 00:54:50,679
Peaches with the round bottom
that`s liKe an apple?

1137
00:54:50,713 --> 00:54:52,738
You got the two... and...

1138
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:56,348
That`s my bad. L`m sorry.

1139
00:54:58,354 --> 00:55:00,083
Hmm.

1140
00:55:01,758 --> 00:55:03,248
Tss.

1141
00:55:05,528 --> 00:55:08,190
Say, man, you seen my pants?

1142
00:55:12,635 --> 00:55:14,227
Malcolm King`s office.

1143
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:15,737
Miss Gladys,
please don`t hang up.

1144
00:55:15,772 --> 00:55:17,137
It`s me, Renee.

1145
00:55:17,173 --> 00:55:18,504
I just need...
Hello? Are you there?

1146
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:19,838
What do you want, Renee?

1147
00:55:19,876 --> 00:55:22,674
Please listen very carefully.

1148
00:55:22,712 --> 00:55:24,475
Malcolm`s been what?

1149
00:55:27,383 --> 00:55:29,749
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1150
00:55:29,786 --> 00:55:31,185
I need to report a crime.

1151
00:55:31,221 --> 00:55:33,655
Fill out a report.
They`ll help you over there.

1152
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:35,658
I ain`t about to hear
about no paperworK.

1153
00:55:35,692 --> 00:55:37,455
Listen,
you need to listen to me.

1154
00:55:37,494 --> 00:55:39,052
Lady, the faster
you fill out the report...

1155
00:55:39,095 --> 00:55:40,687
the faster
somebody can help you.

1156
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:42,129
To hell with paperworK!

1157
00:55:42,165 --> 00:55:43,996
Malcolm King...

1158
00:55:44,033 --> 00:55:46,900
has been Kidnapped. Hmm.

1159
00:55:51,641 --> 00:55:53,336
I inch the dough
with no propane

1160
00:55:53,376 --> 00:55:56,004
I ain`t gotta show I.D.
Up in here, they don`t pay

1161
00:55:56,045 --> 00:55:58,639
So it`s straight to the bar
for drinKs with no chain

1162
00:55:58,681 --> 00:56:00,672
Your game up in my personal
space with no shame

1163
00:56:00,717 --> 00:56:02,947
Need a loss of feeling
for you liKe Novocain

1164
00:56:02,986 --> 00:56:04,112
And get you same day

1165

1166
00:56:05,522 --> 00:56:07,786
No name,

1167
00:56:07,824 --> 00:56:09,689
I might,
an apple to the right...

1168
00:56:09,726 --> 00:56:11,216
Water warm enough for you?

1169
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,194
What?

1170
00:56:18,234 --> 00:56:20,896
I said...

1171
00:56:20,937 --> 00:56:22,905
is the water
warm enough for you?

1172
00:56:22,939 --> 00:56:24,668
Yeah, man, the water`s fine.
LooK...

1173
00:56:26,042 --> 00:56:28,840
Wow. Herb...

1174
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,811
we`re gonna have
to talK about...

1175
00:56:31,848 --> 00:56:33,816
your invasion
of my personal space.

1176
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:37,342
See, where l`m from,
a grown man can`t sit in no tub

1177
00:56:37,387 --> 00:56:39,947
while another grown man
sit and watch him, OK?

1178
00:56:39,989 --> 00:56:41,081
What?!

1179
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:45,487
LooKie here, punK...

1180
00:56:45,528 --> 00:56:48,759
don`t go out mistaKing
my Kindness for weaKness.

1181
00:56:52,468 --> 00:56:54,959
See, up on ``D`` blocK,
where I come from...

1182
00:56:56,105 --> 00:56:58,801
``D`` blocK
didn`t have no bathtubs.

1183
00:56:58,841 --> 00:57:01,537
We only tooK showers...

1184
00:57:01,578 --> 00:57:02,977
once a weeK.

1185
00:57:05,248 --> 00:57:08,081
Now l`m sitting here
looKing at you...

1186
00:57:08,118 --> 00:57:10,211
with all them bubbles on you.

1187
00:57:12,055 --> 00:57:15,183
It only mean
you`re more slippery to me.

1188
00:57:18,795 --> 00:57:20,820
I tell you...

1189
00:57:22,332 --> 00:57:25,563
if you wasn`t
Peaches` boyfriend...

1190
00:57:28,271 --> 00:57:29,636
Ooh!

1191
00:57:39,149 --> 00:57:41,845
Enjoy the grapes.

1192
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:49,253
He`s on the down low.

1193
00:57:51,261 --> 00:57:53,593
Malcolm loves his money
more than life itself.

1194
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:56,599
Those Kidnappers
aren`t seeing a cent.

1195
00:57:59,002 --> 00:58:01,197
All right,
we got some leads here...

1196
00:58:01,237 --> 00:58:03,330
A 9-1-1 call
from Malcolm King...

1197
00:58:03,373 --> 00:58:05,933
came through our switchboard
at 11:14 last night...

1198
00:58:05,975 --> 00:58:09,843
and a limousine registered
to King Enterprises...

1199
00:58:09,879 --> 00:58:11,608
found abandoned on the highway.

1200
00:58:11,648 --> 00:58:13,411
LooK, hey,
we`re in good shape here.

1201
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:14,644
You leave this
in our hands, ma`am.

1202
00:58:14,684 --> 00:58:15,946
We pulled a partial footprint
from the scene.

1203
00:58:15,985 --> 00:58:17,543
It`s being analyzed
in forensics.

1204
00:58:17,587 --> 00:58:19,054
Those boys down at C.S. I...

1205
00:58:19,089 --> 00:58:20,556
l`m telling you,
they taKe one little thread...

1206
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:21,784
and they just scan...

1207
00:58:21,825 --> 00:58:23,588
I don`t Know why
you two are wasting time...

1208
00:58:23,626 --> 00:58:26,618
with all this Top Cop,
Inspector Gadget bullsh...

1209
00:58:26,663 --> 00:58:29,530
Whoa, whoa, whoa, lady.
A little respect.

1210
00:58:29,566 --> 00:58:31,727
This is our job.
We Know what we`re doing.

1211
00:58:31,768 --> 00:58:32,928
If you Knew
what you were doing...

1212
00:58:32,969 --> 00:58:34,766
you wouldn`t be sitting here
talKing to me.

1213
00:58:34,804 --> 00:58:39,070
You`d be out tracKing down
your primary suspects.

1214
00:58:39,109 --> 00:58:40,474
And who might that be?

1215
00:58:45,815 --> 00:58:47,578
Hello. May I help you?

1216
00:58:47,617 --> 00:58:49,141
Renee King?

1217
00:58:49,185 --> 00:58:50,584
Yes.

1218
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:51,985
Do you mind if we come in?

1219
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:55,257
Yes?

1220
00:58:55,291 --> 00:58:57,088
Angela DraKe, I presume?

1221
00:59:02,532 --> 00:59:04,466
Hey, hey, where the hell
have you been, huh?

1222
00:59:04,501 --> 00:59:06,628
Did you forget that you were
supposed to follow up...

1223
00:59:06,669 --> 00:59:08,261
with Renee about the ransom?

1224
00:59:08,304 --> 00:59:10,670
And you`ve got nothing
to eat down here but crap.

1225
00:59:10,707 --> 00:59:12,299
Where`s the real food?

1226
00:59:12,342 --> 00:59:14,003
You Know what, Mr. King?

1227
00:59:14,043 --> 00:59:16,307
I will maKe you a TV dinner.

1228
00:59:17,347 --> 00:59:18,780
For lunch?

1229
00:59:18,815 --> 00:59:21,443
That`s the dumbest thing
l`ve ever heard.

1230
00:59:21,484 --> 00:59:25,113
Hey... remember
when I said you were smart?

1231
00:59:25,155 --> 00:59:26,315
- Yeah.
- Heh heh!

1232
00:59:26,356 --> 00:59:28,153
I was lying, all right?

1233
00:59:28,191 --> 00:59:30,455
You`re just as dumb
as your dumb-ass sister.

1234
00:59:30,493 --> 00:59:32,723
Call Renee.

1235
00:59:38,334 --> 00:59:39,358
Hello?

1236
00:59:41,037 --> 00:59:42,698
Say something.

1237
00:59:42,739 --> 00:59:44,934
Hello? Who is this?
Let`s not play on my phone.

1238
00:59:44,974 --> 00:59:47,442
Hello. How are you today?

1239
00:59:47,477 --> 00:59:49,445
Lousy. L`ve got cramps.
Who is this?

1240
00:59:49,479 --> 00:59:50,878
She wants to Know who I am.

1241
00:59:50,914 --> 00:59:52,108
Tell her you got her husband...

1242
00:59:52,148 --> 00:59:54,048
and not to worry about
who the hell you are.

1243
00:59:54,083 --> 00:59:55,209
I got your husband.

1244
00:59:55,251 --> 00:59:57,185
Don`t worry about
who the hell I am.

1245
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:59,347
- And call her a bitch.
- What?

1246
00:59:59,389 --> 01:00:00,515
- Excuse me?
- No, not you.

1247
01:00:00,557 --> 01:00:02,218
You. What?

1248
01:00:04,394 --> 01:00:06,385
- Call her a bitch.
- Why?

1249
01:00:06,429 --> 01:00:08,522
LooK, I don`t have time
for games. What is this?

1250
01:00:08,565 --> 01:00:11,159
What?
Just call her a bitch.

1251
01:00:11,201 --> 01:00:12,463
Listen up, bitch!

1252
01:00:12,502 --> 01:00:14,493
- Yes!
- Yeah!

1253
01:00:14,537 --> 01:00:17,700
- What`d you just call me?
- No! No, not you, Granny.

1254
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:19,401
Excuse me. Is this a joKe,
or is this...

1255
01:00:19,442 --> 01:00:21,706
- Who is that?
- I don`t have time for this.

1256
01:00:21,744 --> 01:00:24,008
No one. Granny, please,
hang up the phone, OK?

1257
01:00:24,047 --> 01:00:25,514
You got a girl down there?

1258
01:00:25,548 --> 01:00:28,016
I don`t have a girl down here.
Yeah. I Know the rules.

1259
01:00:28,051 --> 01:00:30,849
- ChoKe her. L`ll choKe her.
- A boy down there?

1260
01:00:30,887 --> 01:00:32,718
I don`t have anyone down here!
Please hang up!

1261
01:00:32,755 --> 01:00:36,316
- So she`ll die quicKly.
- Don`t tell me what to do.

1262
01:00:36,359 --> 01:00:39,590
- Get bacK to the money.
- You are worKing my nerves.

1263
01:00:39,629 --> 01:00:41,722
What is this,
and what do you want?

1264
01:00:41,764 --> 01:00:42,924
Get bacK to the money.

1265
01:00:42,966 --> 01:00:44,433
- What do I want?
- Hey, hey!

1266
01:00:44,467 --> 01:00:46,162
- What do I want?
- Shh!

1267
01:00:46,202 --> 01:00:47,635
Demand the ransom.

1268
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:49,968
Demand the ransom.

1269
01:00:50,006 --> 01:00:52,236
I demand the ransom.

1270
01:00:52,275 --> 01:00:54,266
- The...
- Of...

1271
01:00:59,482 --> 01:01:02,280
Ten thousand dol...

1272
01:01:02,318 --> 01:01:03,376
$10,000?

1273
01:01:03,419 --> 01:01:04,716
What the hell is wrong with you?

1274
01:01:04,754 --> 01:01:06,415
- 10.
- $10,000?

1275
01:01:06,456 --> 01:01:08,686
- Yeah, yeah, 10.
- You Kidnapped Malcolm King...

1276
01:01:08,725 --> 01:01:12,286
not Bobby Brown. 10 million.

1277
01:01:12,328 --> 01:01:15,195
$10 million.

1278
01:01:15,231 --> 01:01:17,096
- You understand that?
- Really?

1279
01:01:17,133 --> 01:01:18,464
Yes, really.

1280
01:01:18,501 --> 01:01:20,560
- Do we have it?
- Yeah.

1281
01:01:20,603 --> 01:01:21,763
OK.

1282
01:01:24,173 --> 01:01:28,303
I demand a ransom
of $10 million.

1283
01:01:28,344 --> 01:01:29,368
Yeah.

1284
01:01:29,412 --> 01:01:31,312
Oh, now it`s 10 million?
For what?

1285
01:01:31,347 --> 01:01:37,411
Or you will never see your big,
fat, obnoxious husband alive...

1286
01:01:37,453 --> 01:01:41,446
sweating and ordering
people around ever again.

1287
01:01:41,491 --> 01:01:43,686
- Call her a bitch.
- Bitch!

1288
01:01:48,331 --> 01:01:49,958
- What?
- No, I...

1289
01:01:49,999 --> 01:01:51,728
These chips are good. Yeah.

1290
01:01:53,503 --> 01:01:54,902
Bears stinK!

1291
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,164
I got it.

1292
01:01:59,208 --> 01:02:01,142
Yeah, you get it.

1293
01:02:02,245 --> 01:02:03,439
Holla.

1294
01:02:03,479 --> 01:02:06,505
Baby? I just...

1295
01:02:06,549 --> 01:02:09,017
I wanted to let you Know
that I miss you.

1296
01:02:09,052 --> 01:02:11,350
Watch it! Oh, my God!

1297
01:02:11,387 --> 01:02:14,083
Sorry! I didn`t see you.

1298
01:02:14,123 --> 01:02:17,684
Anyway... l`ll see you,
and I love you.

1299
01:02:17,727 --> 01:02:19,957
- Hey!
- You`re so rude!

1300
01:02:19,996 --> 01:02:21,258
L`m maKing a call!

1301
01:02:21,297 --> 01:02:23,265
Get off of your phone!

1302
01:02:23,299 --> 01:02:25,028
I have to go, baby. I love you.

1303
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:30,703
L`m gonna worK it.

1304
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:32,605
Oh, l`m gonna worK it.

1305
01:02:32,642 --> 01:02:36,237
L`m gonna worK that!

1306
01:02:36,279 --> 01:02:40,773
Ha ha! L`m gonna worK that!
Ha ha ha!

1307
01:02:40,817 --> 01:02:43,980
Hey!
What`s goin` on bacK there?!

1308
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:46,545
Noth-noth-nothin`, man!

1309
01:02:50,326 --> 01:02:52,055
Straight up, man.

1310
01:02:53,563 --> 01:02:55,326
I wonder who did that ad.

1311
01:02:55,365 --> 01:02:58,061
Ooh! I did! Ha ha ha!

1312
01:02:58,101 --> 01:03:00,535
Straight up. ThanKs, man.

1313
01:03:04,107 --> 01:03:06,871
Oh, hey, I can`t get
to the phone right now...

1314
01:03:06,909 --> 01:03:08,706
because l`m busy building
my bird house.

1315
01:03:08,745 --> 01:03:10,337
Hey, hey, get up here!

1316
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:13,213
Jesus, Granny,
l`m doing something right now!

1317
01:03:13,249 --> 01:03:15,149
Hurry up...

1318
01:03:15,184 --> 01:03:18,278
You Know who it is
and you Know why l`m calling.

1319
01:03:18,321 --> 01:03:20,050
You better be getting me
that money soon...

1320
01:03:20,089 --> 01:03:21,886
or I might just have
to go tell the police...

1321
01:03:21,924 --> 01:03:23,721
how you masterminded
a recent outbreaK...

1322
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,558
of semi-violent
convenience store robberies.

1323
01:03:26,596 --> 01:03:28,860
You`re running out of time.

1324
01:03:29,699 --> 01:03:30,893
Damn.

1325
01:03:33,503 --> 01:03:36,995
All right.
I guess I got the right one.

1326
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,735
Billionaire Andrew Ross...

1327
01:03:38,775 --> 01:03:41,005
is in critical condition
after his hot-air balloon...

1328
01:03:41,044 --> 01:03:44,571
plummeted to the ground
in the jungles of Africa.

1329
01:03:44,614 --> 01:03:47,674
He was then attacKed
by a wild rhinoceros.

1330
01:03:47,717 --> 01:03:49,981
White folKs.

1331
01:03:52,288 --> 01:03:54,916
Hey, it tooK you
long enough, man.

1332
01:03:54,957 --> 01:03:58,120
L`m starving.
Where`s my change?

1333
01:04:01,798 --> 01:04:03,459
Ohh.

1334
01:04:03,499 --> 01:04:06,332
Oh, man,
they put mustard on this.

1335
01:04:06,369 --> 01:04:08,132
I told the guy no mustard.

1336
01:04:08,171 --> 01:04:09,661
Well, taKe it bacK, man.

1337
01:04:09,705 --> 01:04:11,605
Aw, it`s no big deal.

1338
01:04:11,641 --> 01:04:15,202
Come on, man, you let people
taKe advantage of you.

1339
01:04:15,244 --> 01:04:17,974
You paid for it.
You should get what you want.

1340
01:04:18,014 --> 01:04:20,847
It`s no biggie, really.

1341
01:04:20,883 --> 01:04:22,646
You Know what?

1342
01:04:22,685 --> 01:04:25,552
You ain`t got no balls.

1343
01:04:25,588 --> 01:04:28,580
You see me? I don`t taKe
nothin` from nobody.

1344
01:04:28,624 --> 01:04:31,525
You want to Know why?
`Cause I got big balls.

1345
01:04:31,561 --> 01:04:34,121
I got big manly balls.

1346
01:04:34,163 --> 01:04:38,156
Big manly, hairy,
sharK-infested swimmin`...

1347
01:04:38,201 --> 01:04:41,295
My balls are so... They hang
to the bacK of my Knee...

1348
01:04:41,337 --> 01:04:42,861
when I wear shorts.
And you Know what?

1349
01:04:42,905 --> 01:04:45,465
I ain`t afraid to let `em
hang for nobody.

1350
01:04:45,508 --> 01:04:47,533
It must be hard for you
to buy underpants.

1351
01:04:47,577 --> 01:04:51,240
Ha ha ha ha!
Shut up, stupid.

1352
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:54,340
You`ve got to stop letting
people taKe advantage of you.

1353
01:04:54,383 --> 01:04:55,975
LooK, it`s just a sandwich.

1354
01:04:58,454 --> 01:05:00,319
Let me show you what l`d do
if it was my sandwich.

1355
01:05:00,356 --> 01:05:02,984
Be the man at the counter.
L`m gonna be me.

1356
01:05:03,025 --> 01:05:05,186
- Yeah, get at the counter.
- OK.

1357
01:05:05,228 --> 01:05:06,661
- Greet me.
- What?

1358
01:05:06,696 --> 01:05:09,392
- Greet me.
- Uh, greetings.

1359
01:05:09,432 --> 01:05:10,990
Yes, looK at this, man!

1360
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:14,161
I asKed for no mustard!
What`s this looK liKe to you?

1361
01:05:14,203 --> 01:05:15,568
- Mustard.
- Yes!

1362
01:05:15,605 --> 01:05:18,369
And since you obviously do not
Know what ``no mustard`` means...

1363
01:05:18,407 --> 01:05:20,875
Here, hold that for me.
ThanK you.

1364
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:24,539
OK, that`s mustard. All right?
That`s mustard right there.

1365
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:27,378
Uh-huh, yeah. Now,
I guarantee if you do that...

1366
01:05:27,416 --> 01:05:30,010
they`ll never mess
your order up again.

1367
01:05:37,693 --> 01:05:39,183
You get any winners yet?

1368
01:05:39,228 --> 01:05:41,856
Do you hear me screaming?

1369
01:05:41,898 --> 01:05:44,924
You guys follow up
on the leads I gave you?

1370
01:05:44,967 --> 01:05:46,628
Yes, we did.

1371
01:05:46,669 --> 01:05:48,136
And?

1372
01:05:48,171 --> 01:05:50,298
And nothing.

1373
01:05:50,339 --> 01:05:53,137
LooK, lady,
l`ve just about had it with you.

1374
01:05:53,176 --> 01:05:54,768
Go home. When we have
something to tell you...

1375
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:56,903
we`ll let you Know.
This case is all about...

1376
01:05:56,946 --> 01:05:59,005
official police business.
We don`t need you...

1377
01:05:59,048 --> 01:06:00,982
I don`t give a damn
about official police business.

1378
01:06:01,017 --> 01:06:03,679
Malcolm King is my business.

1379
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:06,620
L`m gonna leave now,
not because you told me to...

1380
01:06:06,656 --> 01:06:07,987
but because
if I don`t leave now...

1381
01:06:08,024 --> 01:06:09,582
I won`t be able to get
my numbers in.

1382
01:06:09,625 --> 01:06:12,355
But l`ll be bacK.
And until you find him...

1383
01:06:12,395 --> 01:06:16,832
l`m gonna stay on y`all
liKe white girls on NBA players.

1384
01:06:39,956 --> 01:06:41,583
Who is it?

1385
01:06:41,624 --> 01:06:44,058
- It`s us... BrooKe and Kim.
- Hi!

1386
01:06:44,093 --> 01:06:45,617
Come in. The door`s open.

1387
01:06:48,998 --> 01:06:51,023
What tooK you guys so long?

1388
01:06:51,067 --> 01:06:52,932
Huh? The police were here.

1389
01:06:52,969 --> 01:06:54,960
They were asKing questions
about Mr. King.

1390
01:06:55,004 --> 01:06:57,268
You guys, I thinK
we should go to the police...

1391
01:06:57,306 --> 01:06:58,967
and tell them everything
that we Know.

1392
01:06:59,008 --> 01:07:01,374
I mean, it`s not liKe
we actually Kidnapped anybody.

1393
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:03,537
- Yes, we did.
- Well, mostly we didn`t.

1394
01:07:03,579 --> 01:07:06,013
That`s a great idea, Kim.

1395
01:07:06,048 --> 01:07:07,777
Unbelievable!

1396
01:07:07,817 --> 01:07:11,844
I believe the charge
is conspiracy to Kidnapping.

1397
01:07:11,887 --> 01:07:13,616
- OK?
- Yeah.

1398
01:07:13,656 --> 01:07:15,749
I learned a thing or two
about the criminal code...

1399
01:07:15,791 --> 01:07:17,156
when I was at Cornell.

1400
01:07:17,193 --> 01:07:18,558
- Cornell?
- Cornell?

1401
01:07:18,594 --> 01:07:21,529
I thought you said you went to...
Didn`t she go to Harvard?

1402
01:07:21,564 --> 01:07:23,555
- Right, but she did...
- No, it was...

1403
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:24,861
Undergrad at Yale.

1404
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,891
And then when she went
to Princeton, she was...

1405
01:07:26,936 --> 01:07:28,494
No, it was Harvard,
and then she went...

1406
01:07:28,537 --> 01:07:31,199
- Where`d she do her doctorate?
- I lied!

1407
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,537
What?

1408
01:07:34,176 --> 01:07:36,406
I went to DeVry Institute.

1409
01:07:36,445 --> 01:07:38,379
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

1410
01:07:38,414 --> 01:07:40,405
And I didn`t finish.

1411
01:07:40,449 --> 01:07:43,213
And for whatever reason,
the King Enterprises...

1412
01:07:43,252 --> 01:07:46,415
didn`t checK that pacK of lies
I called a rsum.

1413
01:07:46,455 --> 01:07:47,854
Oh, my God.

1414
01:07:47,890 --> 01:07:50,552
LooK, I got a G.E.D.

1415
01:07:50,593 --> 01:07:52,322
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

1416
01:07:52,361 --> 01:07:54,829
And an lvy League
mortgage payment.

1417
01:07:54,864 --> 01:07:58,561
So that maKes me
one desperate, dangerous woman.

1418
01:07:58,601 --> 01:08:01,263
So until this thing
blows over...

1419
01:08:01,304 --> 01:08:03,568
l`m not letting either
one of you aspiring snitches...

1420
01:08:03,606 --> 01:08:04,903
out of my sight.
Is that clear?

1421
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:07,534
- Yeah, but, liKe...
- Yeah, you Know...

1422
01:08:07,576 --> 01:08:10,841
I said... is that clear?

1423
01:08:11,914 --> 01:08:13,404
- Crystal.
- Crystal.

1424
01:08:21,057 --> 01:08:23,582
Dinner is served.

1425
01:08:23,626 --> 01:08:25,218
Ha ha.

1426
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:30,966
I wouldn`t feed
that garbage to a dog.

1427
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,467
You Know what?

1428
01:08:32,501 --> 01:08:36,597
I need you to go down
to PeKing Palace for me, man...

1429
01:08:36,639 --> 01:08:37,936
get me something to eat.

1430
01:08:37,973 --> 01:08:40,407
Get me
some Kung pao chicKen...

1431
01:08:40,443 --> 01:08:42,070
no vegetables, not too spicy...

1432
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:44,739
all white meat,
extra fortune cooKies.

1433
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:46,907
Hey! Hurry up, l`m starving.

1434
01:08:46,949 --> 01:08:48,576
That tooK me
six to eight minutes to maKe.

1435
01:08:48,617 --> 01:08:52,144
It should taKe you that long
to get it out of my face.

1436
01:08:52,188 --> 01:08:53,746
Well...

1437
01:08:53,789 --> 01:08:54,778
What`d you say?

1438
01:09:02,998 --> 01:09:04,625
I called in an order for Renee.

1439
01:09:04,667 --> 01:09:08,068
Oh, yes. Order for Renee.
It is almost ready.

1440
01:09:08,104 --> 01:09:09,366
It just be one second.

1441
01:09:09,405 --> 01:09:10,736
Why don`t you have a seat?

1442
01:09:10,773 --> 01:09:12,764
I will bring it
right for you. OK?

1443
01:09:12,808 --> 01:09:14,867
Maybe you will have
a seat right there...

1444
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:16,537
and you can maybe
sing some KaraoKe, OK?

1445
01:09:16,579 --> 01:09:17,773
You have some fun.

1446
01:09:17,813 --> 01:09:19,371
I don`t thinK so.

1447
01:09:19,415 --> 01:09:21,383
Yeah, yeah

1448
01:09:21,417 --> 01:09:24,181
It should be OK.
What is taKing so long?

1449
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:26,085
What the hell`s
going on down there?

1450
01:09:26,122 --> 01:09:27,555
If I gotta come bacK there
and KicK someone`s ass...

1451
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:29,114
Come on. Now get this one.

1452
01:09:30,493 --> 01:09:34,259
OK, for you, sir,
your order is now ready.

1453
01:09:34,296 --> 01:09:36,821
See? There is one order
of Kung pao chicKen...

1454
01:09:36,866 --> 01:09:40,165
no vegetable, not too spicy,
with all-white meat...

1455
01:09:40,202 --> 01:09:43,296
and extra fortune cooKie,
just liKe you asK, OK?

1456
01:09:43,339 --> 01:09:46,172
- Good. Good night.
- OK, you have a good night.

1457
01:09:46,208 --> 01:09:48,642
We see you again.
You come bacK, OK?

1458
01:09:48,677 --> 01:09:51,771
OK, you guys ready

1459
01:09:51,814 --> 01:09:53,645
Uh, lady. Lady.

1460
01:10:56,111 --> 01:10:59,274
Are you awaKe? Grandma.

1461
01:11:09,892 --> 01:11:11,587
Ooh. Hey.

1462
01:11:11,627 --> 01:11:13,094
Mm. Where`s my change?

1463
01:11:13,128 --> 01:11:16,097
All right.
``Tony`s Tool Shop. ``

1464
01:11:16,131 --> 01:11:20,033
This guy sat the tub in place,
then built a framing around it.

1465
01:11:20,069 --> 01:11:22,799
Damn it, they didn`t put
any silverware in the bag.

1466
01:11:22,838 --> 01:11:24,897
No, here.
I got you chopsticKs.

1467
01:11:26,575 --> 01:11:28,907
Do I looK
liKe JacKie Chan to you?

1468
01:11:28,944 --> 01:11:30,741
Huh? Huh?

1469
01:11:30,779 --> 01:11:34,215
L`m a blacK man.
I eat with a forK.

1470
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:38,914
OK. L`ll go upstairs
and l`ll get you a forK.

1471
01:11:38,954 --> 01:11:41,582
I swear, man,
adopted or not...

1472
01:11:41,624 --> 01:11:44,559
you and Peaches are the dumbest
brother and sister on earth.

1473
01:11:44,593 --> 01:11:46,060
Who`s Peaches?

1474
01:11:46,095 --> 01:11:48,825
Hey, let`s not play games
with me, all right, Herb?

1475
01:11:48,864 --> 01:11:51,162
Just hurry your ass upstairs
and get me a forK.

1476
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,963
Herb? Who`s Herb?

1477
01:11:53,002 --> 01:11:55,994
Ha ha, very funny.
Your name`s not Herb...

1478
01:11:56,038 --> 01:11:58,563
and your sister`s name
isn`t Peaches.

1479
01:11:58,607 --> 01:12:00,507
LooK, stop playing with me, man.

1480
01:12:00,543 --> 01:12:02,238
L`m not playing games.
My name`s not Herb.

1481
01:12:02,278 --> 01:12:04,143
It`s Corey, and my sister`s
name isn`t Peaches.

1482
01:12:04,179 --> 01:12:06,841
It`s Raven.
Watch, l`ll show you a picture.

1483
01:12:10,119 --> 01:12:12,815
LooK, that`s my sister.
That`s Raven.

1484
01:12:18,327 --> 01:12:21,626
If you`re not
Peaches` brother...

1485
01:12:27,603 --> 01:12:30,197
then l`ve been Kidnapped
for real.

1486
01:12:37,546 --> 01:12:39,013
Oh!

1487
01:12:40,082 --> 01:12:42,175
Ow!

1488
01:12:46,922 --> 01:12:48,014
- Whoa!
- Aha!

1489
01:12:48,057 --> 01:12:49,991
- The hell?
- Yes, I Knew it!

1490
01:12:50,025 --> 01:12:51,583
I Knew it!
Kung pao chicKen...

1491
01:12:51,627 --> 01:12:53,219
Renee, what the hell
are you doing here?

1492
01:12:53,262 --> 01:12:54,991
The better question is,
what are you doing here?

1493
01:12:55,030 --> 01:12:56,156
Whoa!

1494
01:12:56,198 --> 01:12:59,463
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

1495
01:13:06,375 --> 01:13:09,139
What is this?

1496
01:13:09,178 --> 01:13:12,170
Uhh! Uhh!

1497
01:13:12,214 --> 01:13:13,613
Damn it!

1498
01:13:13,649 --> 01:13:16,015
Untie us right now, man.
L`m not gonna say it again.

1499
01:13:16,051 --> 01:13:17,882
L`m sorry. I can`t do that.

1500
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,114
Why not?

1501
01:13:19,154 --> 01:13:21,554
`Cause I just need some time
to thinK things out, you guys.

1502
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:23,581
LooK, Mr. King, I didn`t
want to Kidnap you ever.

1503
01:13:23,626 --> 01:13:26,424
Really. I really didn`t.
I even tried to let you go.

1504
01:13:26,462 --> 01:13:29,454
You Know that, but you insisted
on going through...

1505
01:13:29,498 --> 01:13:31,489
with your plan
of having yourself Kidnapped...

1506
01:13:31,533 --> 01:13:33,592
so you wouldn`t have to give her
a divorce settlement.

1507
01:13:33,636 --> 01:13:34,933
Hold on.
His what to do what?

1508
01:13:34,970 --> 01:13:36,369
He was planning
to have himself Kidnapped...

1509
01:13:36,405 --> 01:13:38,134
so he wouldn`t have to pay you
a big divorce settlement.

1510
01:13:38,173 --> 01:13:39,299
Shut up!

1511
01:13:39,341 --> 01:13:43,038
Ooh. I Knew you were
gonna try something slicK...

1512
01:13:43,078 --> 01:13:46,536
to get out of paying me.
But Kidnapping yourself?!

1513
01:13:46,582 --> 01:13:49,676
Malcolm, this is really low,
even for you.

1514
01:13:49,718 --> 01:13:51,618
What about you?
You said yourself...

1515
01:13:51,654 --> 01:13:53,087
you wanted to have him
Kidnapped.

1516
01:13:53,122 --> 01:13:54,589
I did not.
What are you talKing about?

1517
01:13:54,623 --> 01:13:55,954
I don`t even Know you.

1518
01:13:55,991 --> 01:13:57,288
Right after
you fell down the stairs.

1519
01:13:57,326 --> 01:13:58,793
You were all delirious
and mumbling.

1520
01:13:58,827 --> 01:14:00,556
``I was gonna Kidnap you,
too, Malcolm. ``

1521
01:14:00,596 --> 01:14:02,564
l... Shut... Shut it up!

1522
01:14:02,598 --> 01:14:04,566
- Uhh!
- Ohh! Hey!

1523
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,501
What Kind of woman wants
to Kidnap her own husband?

1524
01:14:07,536 --> 01:14:10,630
The Kind that would marry a man
who`d faKe his own Kidnapping...

1525
01:14:10,673 --> 01:14:12,004
to get out of
a divorce settlement.

1526
01:14:12,041 --> 01:14:13,269
Just shut it, Renee!

1527
01:14:13,308 --> 01:14:14,275
- You shut it!
- Shut it up!

1528
01:14:14,309 --> 01:14:16,869
Be quiet, please.
My granny is sleeping.

1529
01:14:16,912 --> 01:14:18,880
To hell with your grandmother!

1530
01:14:18,914 --> 01:14:20,711
What`s wrong with you?
Don`t be...

1531
01:14:20,749 --> 01:14:21,909
First of all,
don`t be yelling at me.

1532
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:23,975
L`m the only friend
you got right now.

1533
01:14:24,019 --> 01:14:25,452
You Know,
for a married couple...

1534
01:14:25,487 --> 01:14:27,250
you guys sure don`t seem
to love each other.

1535
01:14:27,289 --> 01:14:28,517
- We don`t!
- We don`t!

1536
01:14:33,629 --> 01:14:35,221
Room service!

1537
01:14:38,534 --> 01:14:40,798
Peach... Peaches,
what you doing here?

1538
01:14:40,836 --> 01:14:43,737
I have to see Malcolm.
I miss him too much.

1539
01:14:43,772 --> 01:14:46,639
Hey, now, the plan was that
you wasn`t gonna see him...

1540
01:14:46,675 --> 01:14:48,267
until after we get finished.

1541
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:50,175
I Know, I Know,
and I won`t see him.

1542
01:14:50,212 --> 01:14:52,908
LooK, l`ll turn off the lights
and l`ll even wear this.

1543
01:14:52,948 --> 01:14:56,076
- Blindfold.
- See? We won`t see each other.

1544
01:14:56,118 --> 01:14:58,678
- Please, Herbie!
- Peaches.

1545
01:15:05,394 --> 01:15:08,329
Baby. Ohh.

1546
01:15:09,431 --> 01:15:10,625
Mmm.

1547
01:15:12,434 --> 01:15:14,459
Don`t be mad at me.

1548
01:15:14,503 --> 01:15:16,061
Please!

1549
01:15:16,105 --> 01:15:19,438
And don`t say anything.
I just missed you too much.

1550
01:15:19,475 --> 01:15:24,310
Aw, baby.
You lost so much weight.

1551
01:15:24,346 --> 01:15:27,315
Hey, where did that come from?

1552
01:15:27,349 --> 01:15:30,512
Oh ho ho! Wow!

1553
01:15:39,261 --> 01:15:41,456
Ohh. Ha ha!

1554
01:15:44,266 --> 01:15:48,327
Damn! Y`all was in there
for a long time.

1555
01:15:48,370 --> 01:15:51,703
Malcolm never did that before.

1556
01:15:53,909 --> 01:15:56,139
Bye, Herbie.

1557
01:15:56,178 --> 01:15:57,805
Aah! Ow!

1558
01:15:57,846 --> 01:16:00,974
Disgrace to the whole family.

1559
01:16:01,016 --> 01:16:02,916
...is all it taKes.

1560
01:16:02,951 --> 01:16:05,044
You start out
with the scissor crunch...

1561
01:16:05,087 --> 01:16:06,952
Whoo!

1562
01:16:09,758 --> 01:16:10,884

1564
01:16:12,795 --> 01:16:15,855
I Know if I can hit once,

1566

1568

Magic

1570
01:16:26,842 --> 01:16:27,968
Whew.

1571
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:30,945
I ain`t felt liKe this
in a long time, Herb.

1572
01:16:30,979 --> 01:16:34,107
Long time. Whoo!
I worKed it.

1573
01:16:34,149 --> 01:16:35,673
Had to worK it out
on your sister.

1574
01:16:35,717 --> 01:16:38,185
She a freaK.

1575
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:40,950
She worKed... Whoa, man!
Stop playin`! Sit down!

1576
01:16:41,623 --> 01:16:45,218
Corey, I said get up here!

1577
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:46,784
Yes, Granny?

1578
01:16:46,829 --> 01:16:48,626
Can`t find the remote.

1579
01:16:48,664 --> 01:16:50,894
Turn the channel for me.

1580
01:16:50,933 --> 01:16:52,662
You called me all the way
up here for that?

1581
01:16:52,701 --> 01:16:54,498
Yeah. Don`t give me no lip.

1582
01:16:54,536 --> 01:16:57,300
Just, uh, do what I say.

1583
01:16:57,339 --> 01:17:00,604
I can see the remote
from here, Granny.

1584
01:17:02,678 --> 01:17:04,509
You do it.

1585
01:17:04,546 --> 01:17:06,844
Uhh... OK?

1586
01:17:06,882 --> 01:17:09,248
No. No.

1587
01:17:12,855 --> 01:17:14,516
No!

1588
01:17:17,025 --> 01:17:18,117
After weeKs
of an intensive...

1589
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,060
Hey, what happened to Monty?

1590
01:17:20,095 --> 01:17:21,562
...captured
the men responsible...

1591
01:17:21,597 --> 01:17:23,588
for the Kidnapping
of little MarK Wilson.

1592
01:17:23,632 --> 01:17:25,691
If convicted of Kidnapping...

1593
01:17:25,734 --> 01:17:28,362
the men
face life imprisonment...

1594
01:17:28,403 --> 01:17:30,701
without the possibility
of parole.

1595
01:17:30,739 --> 01:17:34,197
Bad news. I can`t let you go.

1596
01:17:34,243 --> 01:17:37,906
OK, when you say ``you, ``
you mean her, right?

1597
01:17:37,946 --> 01:17:40,005
No, I mean the both of you.
I can`t let you go.

1598
01:17:40,048 --> 01:17:41,208
What do you mean,
you can`t let me go?

1599
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:42,410
Man, what are you
talKing about?

1600
01:17:42,451 --> 01:17:44,180
L`m talKing about
if you guys told on me...

1601
01:17:44,219 --> 01:17:45,914
I could go to jail
for the rest of my life!

1602
01:17:45,954 --> 01:17:47,945
Man, that`s not that long!
W-what?

1603
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:49,821
Hey, hey, hey,
we won`t tell. I swear.

1604
01:17:49,858 --> 01:17:51,120
We promise.

1605
01:17:51,159 --> 01:17:53,252
``You promise. `` People breaK
their promises all the time.

1606
01:17:53,295 --> 01:17:54,455
Not us.

1607
01:17:54,496 --> 01:17:55,986
You guys got married
and you promised...

1608
01:17:56,031 --> 01:17:58,727
that you would obey and cherish
and love each other.

1609
01:17:58,767 --> 01:18:01,497
Now you`re getting a divorce.
You broKe those promises!

1610
01:18:01,536 --> 01:18:03,060
That`s different.

1611
01:18:03,105 --> 01:18:04,163
How is it different?

1612
01:18:04,206 --> 01:18:05,867
LooK, I don`t Know how
it`s different.

1613
01:18:05,908 --> 01:18:07,466
It`s just different,
OK, stupid?

1614
01:18:07,509 --> 01:18:09,636
- Oh, hey, way to go.
- What?

1615
01:18:09,678 --> 01:18:11,202
You have such a way with people.

1616
01:18:11,246 --> 01:18:12,713
Why don`t you fuss at him
some more?

1617
01:18:12,748 --> 01:18:15,148
L`m sure he`ll let us
go now, dummy.

1618
01:18:15,183 --> 01:18:17,083
Did you just call me dummy?

1619
01:18:17,119 --> 01:18:18,609
I just called you dummy, dummy.

1620
01:18:18,654 --> 01:18:20,485
Oh, I got your dummy right here.

1621
01:18:20,522 --> 01:18:23,650
Shut up! By the way,
it`s time for a cigarette.

1622
01:18:23,692 --> 01:18:25,182
Can I get a smoKe?

1623
01:18:25,227 --> 01:18:26,854
No. No, she don`t need no smoKe.

1624
01:18:26,895 --> 01:18:28,419
Don`t tell me what I don`t need.

1625
01:18:29,998 --> 01:18:32,330
You Know what, Renee?
Shut up!

1626
01:18:32,367 --> 01:18:34,699
Just shut it up, Renee!
I will not taKe that!

1627
01:18:34,736 --> 01:18:37,136
You`re mad `cause
the truth finally came out!

1628
01:18:37,172 --> 01:18:41,268
- What truth?!
- We`re tied up because of you!

1629
01:18:41,310 --> 01:18:42,902
Turn to ``106 and ParK. ``

1630
01:18:42,945 --> 01:18:44,970
OK.

1631
01:18:47,382 --> 01:18:49,646
Actually, I don`t want
to watch ``106 and ParK. ``

1632
01:18:49,685 --> 01:18:51,380
I would liKe to watch
``Dr. Phil, `` please.

1633
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:54,719
You and big-head Dr. Phil
both can Kiss my blacK ass.

1634
01:18:54,756 --> 01:18:56,155
We`re watching ``106 and ParK. ``

1635
01:18:56,191 --> 01:18:58,921
We should watch something that
elevates our consciousness.

1636
01:18:58,961 --> 01:19:00,087
- We need to watch...
- Hey!

1637
01:19:00,128 --> 01:19:01,686
- What?
- Listen to me.

1638
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:05,359
Maybe when l`m done playing
my video game...

1639
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:09,268
maybe we can watch
the first half of ``106 and ParK``

1640
01:19:09,304 --> 01:19:11,534
and the second half
of ``Dr. Phil``...

1641
01:19:11,573 --> 01:19:13,598
if I feel liKe it.

1642
01:19:13,642 --> 01:19:16,577
Hey, hey, hey, what Kind
of nonsense is that, huh?

1643
01:19:16,611 --> 01:19:18,806
Who watches half a show?

1644
01:19:18,847 --> 01:19:21,907
Yeah, and everybody Knows
the best part of ``Dr. Phil``...

1645
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:23,178
is in the beginning.

1646
01:19:23,218 --> 01:19:24,378
Huh. If you watch him.

1647
01:19:24,419 --> 01:19:25,977
Well, I do.
That`s why I Know...

1648
01:19:26,021 --> 01:19:29,582
and you don`t Know what to say
sometimes, do you?

1649
01:19:29,624 --> 01:19:31,854
L`m just trying to help.

1650
01:19:31,893 --> 01:19:33,520
- Corey, hurry up!
- Ooh.

1651
01:19:33,562 --> 01:19:36,190
Well, I see why
you`re still a virgin.

1652
01:19:36,231 --> 01:19:39,132
Whoo! Ha ha ha ha!
That`s a good one.

1653
01:19:39,167 --> 01:19:43,297
Hey, hey!
L`m not a virgin, OK?

1654
01:19:43,338 --> 01:19:44,669
Not entirely.

1655
01:19:46,141 --> 01:19:48,473
You`re still a virgin.

1656
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:50,171
L`m not!

1657
01:19:50,212 --> 01:19:52,237
Hey, Renee,
did he say ``not entirely``?

1658
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:53,542
- Well...
- Ha ha!

1659
01:19:53,582 --> 01:19:56,642
Hey, looK here, player,
either you are, or you aren`t.

1660
01:19:56,685 --> 01:19:58,676
Which one is it?
Have you touched it yet?

1661
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:00,711
Aah!

1662
01:20:02,457 --> 01:20:05,551
Oh. Oh, no, he didn`t.

1663
01:20:05,594 --> 01:20:07,255
Man, what`s your problem?

1664
01:20:07,295 --> 01:20:10,355
You! You`re my problem.

1665
01:20:10,399 --> 01:20:13,163
And her and her
and Raven and Timmy...

1666
01:20:13,201 --> 01:20:15,328
and Miss Ho
and that stupid sandwich!

1667
01:20:15,370 --> 01:20:18,168
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1668
01:20:18,206 --> 01:20:19,673
You need to bring some of
that bass out of your voice...

1669
01:20:19,708 --> 01:20:21,039
when you`re talKing to me.

1670
01:20:21,076 --> 01:20:22,509
Shut up!

1671
01:20:22,544 --> 01:20:25,240
You don`t Know... Oh, come on!
You Know what?

1672
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,747
You`re not the boss of me.

1673
01:20:26,782 --> 01:20:28,750
- What?
- You Know what?

1674
01:20:28,784 --> 01:20:30,183
Because I could Kill you
right now.

1675
01:20:30,218 --> 01:20:33,654
I could bash your head in
liKe a melon if I felt liKe it!

1676
01:20:33,688 --> 01:20:36,816
And nobody would even care.
You want to Know why?

1677
01:20:36,858 --> 01:20:41,386
Because you are a jacKass!
A jacKass!

1678
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:44,888
You`re a jacKass,
and you`re a super-size jacKass.

1679
01:20:44,933 --> 01:20:47,800
No wonder everybody hates you!
L`ve Known you a day...

1680
01:20:47,836 --> 01:20:50,805
and I want to rip off my head
and throw it in the trash...

1681
01:20:50,839 --> 01:20:53,137
just so I don`t have to listen
to you anymore!

1682
01:20:53,175 --> 01:20:55,700
You two deserve each other.

1683
01:20:55,744 --> 01:20:58,542
Corey, I said get up here!

1684
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:00,912
Listen up.

1685
01:21:00,949 --> 01:21:05,648
L`m going upstairs to taKe
care of that deaf old bag...

1686
01:21:05,687 --> 01:21:07,882
and then l`m going for a drive.

1687
01:21:07,923 --> 01:21:09,322
And when I come bacK...

1688
01:21:09,357 --> 01:21:11,518
l`m gonna deal with you two.

1689
01:21:12,861 --> 01:21:17,662
And you can scream all you want
because no one can hear you.

1690
01:21:17,699 --> 01:21:21,533
Then you shaKe
your booty-ooty to the ground

1691
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:23,003
Can you shaKe it
to the four zone?

1692
01:21:23,038 --> 01:21:25,632
One, don`t wait now

1693
01:21:25,674 --> 01:21:27,073
Will you shaKe it
to the four zone?

1694
01:21:27,109 --> 01:21:30,272
Two, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow

1695
01:21:30,312 --> 01:21:31,506
Can you shaKe it
to the four zone?

1696
01:21:31,546 --> 01:21:32,570
Baby, let`s try
to get out of these ropes.

1697
01:21:33,248 --> 01:21:35,239
OK, exactly what part
of life in prison...

1698
01:21:35,283 --> 01:21:36,648
don`t you understand?

1699
01:21:36,685 --> 01:21:38,175
Angela, don`t worry.

1700
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:40,017
We`re good-looKing.
We`ll be fine.

1701
01:21:40,055 --> 01:21:42,580
Wait. No. Hey, hey. Listen.

1702
01:21:42,624 --> 01:21:45,650
Angela, Mr. King could be
in real danger right now.

1703
01:21:45,694 --> 01:21:48,094
We have no idea what
those maniacs are doing to him.

1704
01:21:48,130 --> 01:21:50,155
He`s not in any real danger.

1705
01:21:50,198 --> 01:21:52,689
Listen,
I Know you`re scared...

1706
01:21:52,734 --> 01:21:54,895
but we all have to have
a little faith.

1707
01:21:54,936 --> 01:21:56,961
We`re going to jail, man.

1708
01:21:57,005 --> 01:21:58,870
The Lord will protect us.

1709
01:22:02,844 --> 01:22:05,369
OK, OK. All right?

1710
01:22:07,482 --> 01:22:11,509
When we`re being passed
around the ``C`` blocK...

1711
01:22:11,553 --> 01:22:14,181
bought and sold for
a pacK of Newport King 100s...

1712
01:22:14,222 --> 01:22:16,918
remember...

1713
01:22:16,958 --> 01:22:18,391
it was the Lord
that put us there.

1714
01:22:18,426 --> 01:22:19,552
Ohh.

1715
01:22:19,594 --> 01:22:21,653
- OK?
- OK.

1716
01:22:21,696 --> 01:22:24,062
Can we maKe a quicK stop
before we turn ourselves in?

1717
01:22:24,099 --> 01:22:25,999
Just... lt`ll be really quicK.

1718
01:22:28,336 --> 01:22:31,396
Now, listen,
l`m going to jail, OK?

1719
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:32,963
And I need this money
to pay for protection.

1720
01:22:33,008 --> 01:22:34,805

01:22:44,519 --> 01:22:46,544
``He hears us whenever we asK... ``

1806
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:54,133
It`s OK.
We can worK it loose.

1807
01:25:54,175 --> 01:25:55,540
This is useless.

1808
01:25:55,577 --> 01:25:56,839

We`re getting out of here alive.

Just help me with the ropes,

1819
01:26:15,930 --> 01:26:17,625
Come on, Mama,

01:26:17,665 --> 01:26:20,498
OK, baby? Come on, I don`t

01:26:20,535 --> 01:26:21,695
Oh, wait, listen, listen.

1822
01:26:21,736 --> 01:26:23,829

1823
01:26:24,839 --> 01:26:26,067
It`s really good to see you

1824
01:26:26,107 --> 01:26:27,904
Oh, we`re going to die

1825
01:26:27,942 --> 01:26:30,536
Renee, Renee, Renee, Renee, hey.

Hey, hey, baby. Hey.

01:26:36,151 --> 01:26:37,675
Tch. You don`t remember.

1829

Hmm. Remember?

1830
01:26:39,854 --> 01:26:42,880
Hey, you gave me some
that night.

1831
01:26:44,125 --> 01:26:47,026
It always helps
to give you a little.

1832
01:26:47,061 --> 01:26:51,623
Hey, what happened to us, Renee?

1833
01:26:51,666 --> 01:26:55,602
We were happy once, right?

1834
01:26:57,539 --> 01:26:59,006
Don`t mind fools

1835
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,974
There`s no way
I am losing him now.

1836
01:27:02,343 --> 01:27:03,640
Right there!

1837
01:27:03,678 --> 01:27:05,976
Uh, uh, red light.

1838
01:27:06,014 --> 01:27:07,504
- Aah! Stop!
- Aah!

1839
01:27:13,855 --> 01:27:15,015
``Forgive us our trespasses... ``

1840
01:27:15,056 --> 01:27:16,614
``As we forgive those
that trespass against us``!

1841
01:27:16,658 --> 01:27:18,455
I thinK we`re all right.

1842
01:27:21,863 --> 01:27:23,091
No, we`re not all right.

1843
01:27:23,131 --> 01:27:26,191
...was my claim to fame

1844
01:27:26,234 --> 01:27:29,032
ThanK you, Renee.

1845
01:27:29,070 --> 01:27:30,731
Uh, yeah. For what?

1846
01:27:30,772 --> 01:27:32,865
For being a no-good,
gold-digging...

1847
01:27:32,907 --> 01:27:34,397
whatever you going

1848
01:27:34,442 --> 01:27:37,843
No, no, no, no, baby.
ThanK you.

1849
01:27:37,879 --> 01:27:40,439
You deserve it.

1850
01:27:40,482 --> 01:27:42,040
I was cold as ice

1851
01:27:42,083 --> 01:27:43,710
You Know, l`ve never
given you the credit...

1852
01:27:43,751 --> 01:27:47,312
for always having my bacK
and Keeping me focused.

1853
01:27:47,355 --> 01:27:51,223
You Know, I always thought
it was me...

1854
01:27:51,259 --> 01:27:54,285
but it was you who gave me
that strength.

1855
01:27:54,329 --> 01:27:55,660
Very nice, you Know

1856
01:27:55,697 --> 01:27:56,789
ThanK you.

1857
01:27:56,831 --> 01:27:57,957
Sugar, sugar, sugar

1858
01:27:57,999 --> 01:28:00,229
Oh, Malcolm.

1859
01:28:02,103 --> 01:28:03,593
Hey...

1860
01:28:03,638 --> 01:28:06,505
And you turned on

1861
01:28:06,541 --> 01:28:08,065
I have a confession.

1862
01:28:08,109 --> 01:28:10,475
If it`s about you sleeping
with some woman...

1863
01:28:10,512 --> 01:28:12,912
in your company,
I figured as much.

1864
01:28:12,947 --> 01:28:15,643
Baby

1865
01:28:15,683 --> 01:28:17,207
Can you forgive me?

1866
01:28:17,252 --> 01:28:19,152
If you burn me up

1867
01:28:19,187 --> 01:28:21,849
Yeah. It`s in the past.

1868
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:27,994
I have a confession
to maKe, too.

1869
01:28:28,029 --> 01:28:31,829
LooK, if it`s about
you having an affair...

1870
01:28:31,866 --> 01:28:33,231
I Know that, too.

1871
01:28:35,637 --> 01:28:36,763
How?

1872
01:28:36,804 --> 01:28:40,240
Come on, Renee.
We`re separated...

1873
01:28:40,275 --> 01:28:42,573
which means you haven`t been
getting any from me...

1874
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:44,908
and we both Know how
you liKe to get you some.

1875
01:28:44,946 --> 01:28:46,072
True, true.

1876
01:28:46,114 --> 01:28:48,480
You Know, I just figured...

1877
01:28:48,516 --> 01:28:50,381
you`d be getting it
from someplace else.

1878
01:28:52,420 --> 01:28:53,944
And I forgive you.

1879
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:00,753
I have another confession.

1880
01:29:01,863 --> 01:29:05,128
Damn. Another affair?

1881
01:29:06,367 --> 01:29:08,961
I pooted. Sorry.

1882
01:29:09,003 --> 01:29:11,471
L`m sorry. It was...

1883
01:29:13,107 --> 01:29:14,665
No, you`re not.

1884
01:29:14,709 --> 01:29:17,906
You can`t even smell it.
Shut up. Ha ha!

1885
01:29:20,114 --> 01:29:22,878
That`s the thing
about going inside...

1886
01:29:22,917 --> 01:29:24,509
rather than taKing
the drive-through.

1887
01:29:24,552 --> 01:29:26,486
I Know, I Know.
But just don`t touch the glazed.

1888
01:29:26,521 --> 01:29:27,681
Don`t touch the glazed.

1889
01:29:27,722 --> 01:29:29,417
We`ve only got two,
and I don`t thinK that...

1890
01:29:29,457 --> 01:29:31,425
What`s going on
with Malcolm`s case?

1891
01:29:31,459 --> 01:29:33,984
Holy Malloley.
I thought I told you to st...

1892
01:29:34,028 --> 01:29:35,120
Attention all units.

1893
01:29:35,163 --> 01:29:36,994
LooKing for a white male

You guys are disgusting.

1911
01:30:38,893 --> 01:30:40,622
What did you do?

1912
01:30:40,662 --> 01:30:43,961
I had to go

1913
01:30:43,998 --> 01:30:46,057
Oh... oh, my God!
Malcolm, save me!

1930
01:31:22,003 --> 01:31:24,130

you run for the steps.

1931
01:31:24,172 --> 01:31:25,799
- OK. I love you.

01:31:31,279 --> 01:31:34,442
Don`t drop the soap in jail.

All right.
Why didn`t you stop?

1943
01:31:57,305 --> 01:32:02,106
Because Malcolm King`s Kidnapper
is in that house.

1944
01:32:02,143 --> 01:32:03,542
What?

1945
01:32:06,748 --> 01:32:08,773
Oh! Oh!

01:32:11,285 --> 01:32:12,274
Aah!

1948
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,550

Everyone else, on me!

1949
01:32:14,589 --> 01:32:16,921
- Are you crazy?!
- That was cool.

1950
01:32:16,958 --> 01:32:18,653
Two months away
from my retirement...

1951
01:32:18,693 --> 01:32:21,560

Possible suspects inside.

1970
01:33:13,247 --> 01:33:14,373
Well, well, well.

1971
01:33:14,415 --> 01:33:17,441
The infamous Malcolm King
and the little woman.

1972
01:33:17,485 --> 01:33:20,318
Hey, Officer,
this psycho right here...

1973
01:33:20,354 --> 01:33:21,480
- Hey, hey!
- What?

1974
01:33:21,522 --> 01:33:23,456
Before you tell them anything,
let me remind you

1975
01:33:23,491 --> 01:33:25,152
that you tried
to Kidnap yourself...

1976
01:33:25,193 --> 01:33:26,854
and she tried to Kidnap you.
Both are federal offenses...

1977
01:33:26,894 --> 01:33:29,886
and you could go to jail
for the rest of your life.

1978
01:33:29,931 --> 01:33:32,024
- You were saying?
- I was...

1979
01:33:32,066 --> 01:33:33,328
Get up, Malcolm.

1980
01:33:33,367 --> 01:33:34,925
L`m saying this psycho

1981
01:33:34,969 --> 01:33:36,561
No! No!

1982
01:33:36,604 --> 01:33:39,971
This psycho here...
This psycho...

1983
01:33:40,007 --> 01:33:44,569
This psychotherapist
saved our marriage.

1984
01:33:44,612 --> 01:33:46,011
- What?

1985
01:33:46,047 --> 01:33:49,380
Ha ha!
Yeah, Detective Conley. Wow.

1986
01:33:49,417 --> 01:33:51,351
You Know, the next day,
after you left...

1987
01:33:51,385 --> 01:33:52,613
my husband called me...

1988
01:33:52,653 --> 01:33:55,588
to this unconventional
couples` therapy...

1989
01:33:55,623 --> 01:33:57,648
where he locKs the couples up
in the basement...

1990
01:33:57,692 --> 01:34:01,355
and doesn`t let them go
until they resolve their issues.

1991
01:34:01,395 --> 01:34:03,693
Yes, yes.
Uh, so we`ve been here...

01:34:07,201 --> 01:34:08,930
Resolving our marital issues.

01:34:08,970 --> 01:34:12,371
Uh, see?
So it`s... it`s all cool.

1996
01:34:12,406 --> 01:34:14,340
We`ve just been
trying to find the love.

01:34:14,375 --> 01:34:16,843

L`m retiring in two months.
I don`t need this.

2004
01:34:31,259 --> 01:34:34,524
And you... sunshine boy.

2005
01:34:34,562 --> 01:34:36,792
Guess what?
You`re going downtown.

For the assault

2009
01:34:43,704 --> 01:34:47,333
Or is that just another one of
your breaKthrough therapies?

Yeah. Yes, it is one of
my breaKthrough therapies.

01:34:49,977 --> 01:34:51,376
It`s a motivational therapy.

01:34:51,412 --> 01:34:52,936
We don`t Know nothin`
about that.

2013
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:54,242
We were just here

2014
01:34:54,282 --> 01:34:55,476

Mr. King!

2033
01:35:40,027 --> 01:35:42,655
Were you treated fairly,
Mr. King?

2034
01:35:42,697 --> 01:35:44,562
Did they sexually abuse you,
Mr. King?

2035
01:35:44,598 --> 01:35:47,761
Hey, hey, hey. What`s this?
What`s going on here?

2036
01:35:47,802 --> 01:35:50,168
Mr. King,

Condoleezza?

You Kidnapped me?

2042
01:36:05,453 --> 01:36:06,977
Well, I tried.

2043
01:36:08,956 --> 01:36:12,084
That`s exactly the cold-blooded,
no-mercy tactics...

2044
01:36:12,126 --> 01:36:14,219
that I need in a vice-president.

2045
01:36:14,261 --> 01:36:15,853
Hell, if you acted liKe this

2046
01:36:15,896 --> 01:36:18,660
we would`ve never had
any problems.

2047
01:36:18,699 --> 01:36:21,361
You Know what?
Don`t worry about this.

2048

You got it. Hey, hey, hey.

You be easy with her.

2055

Wow, you`re a vice-president.
That`s really cool.

2056
01:36:35,950 --> 01:36:37,417
Yeah, I don`t have
