00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,700
Before my mom died,

3
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:39,676
she told me I wasn't dumb.

4
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,033
I was just a slow learner.

5
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,466
She was a smart lady.

6
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,900
That's what my dad says.

7
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,909
I remember once she told me,
ever since the Civil War,

8
00:04:54,933 --> 00:04:58,566
people in the South
had this problem...

9
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:02,642
they felt inferior, real
sensitive about people

10
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:07,666
criticizing their lifestyles
or education or whatnot.

11
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:13,066
But there's no need to
feel inferior, she said.

12
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:20,266
Not everybody's meant to be a
doctor, an artist, whatever.

13
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,066
There's nothing wrong with
being an average kid.

14
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,633
Luke.

15
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:40,409
You don't want to
have to go back

16
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:42,700
and re-do another year.

17
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:44,700
No.

18
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:48,900
You'd rather it was
all over, right?

19
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:52,166
School, math problems...

20
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,233
- Yeah.

21
00:05:56,266 --> 00:05:58,409
I'm sorry, I'll bring it tomorrow.
I did it.

22
00:05:58,433 --> 00:06:00,166
I just forgot.

23
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,000
Besides being here...

24
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:14,400
- Normal.

25
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,400
Spending a lot of
time with Jonah.

26
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,000
Jonah?

27
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:23,333
- My boyfriend.

28
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,642
- Right.

29
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:25,776
Um...

30
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,609
Is he...

31
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:28,166
redhead, right?

32
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,600
- Yeah that's him.
- Cute guy.

33
00:06:32,366 --> 00:06:33,533
- Yep.

34
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:36,966
Lucky me.

35
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:39,476
I never had him.

36
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,176
- You wouldn't.

37
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,233
He's gifted.

38
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,733
- Oh.

39
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:53,500
- He leaves in August.

40
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,033
College?

41
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:57,800
- Yep.

42
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:07,300
- Um... forever.

43
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,376
We've known each other
since we were four.

44
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,733
- Wow.

45
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,966
Your families know?
- More or less.

46
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:23,976
- I just... Nobody
really talks about it.

47
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,242
It's not that big of a deal.
- Okay.

48
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:30,433
- Anyway, it doesn't matter.

49
00:07:31,966 --> 00:07:33,609
I'm not that upset about it.

50
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:36,233
Everybody knew he was
gonna leave, so...

51
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,466
it's not that big of a surprise.

52
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:44,342
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

53
00:07:44,366 --> 00:07:47,066
He's better than
all of this, so...

54
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,666
- Here.

55
00:07:53,866 --> 00:08:00,109
- I like it here.
- Different strokes.

56
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:02,966
- So... why do you
think he's better?

57
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:08,166
- Um... okay... so...

58
00:08:09,566 --> 00:08:13,966
He did this little
painting of a watermelon

59
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:16,633
when he was, like, four.

60
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:19,976
It was supposed to
be a watermelon.

61
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,209
Like, a slice of watermelon.

62
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:25,900
You really couldn't tell what it was.
I thought it was a ladybug.

63
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:31,700
But his teacher said it
reminded her of modern artists.

64
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:34,666
She gave his parents a
hundred bucks for it.

65
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:37,666
He was only four.

66
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,066
He's good at everything.

67
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:44,900
I'm sure he's not
good at everything.

68
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,066
- Fine.

69
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,442
He sucks at sports.

70
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:50,666
- Well...

71
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,266
- Lots of people.

72
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,709
- Anyway, he's better now.

73
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:00,066
A little.

74
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,133
I taught him a few things.

75
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:08,000
I taught him how to swim.

76
00:09:08,566 --> 00:09:10,242
- You were on the
swim team, right?

77
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:13,366
- Yeah, and baseball.

78
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:17,509
His parents signed
him up for baseball.

79
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:18,709
You can imagine how that went.

80
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:19,933
Um...

81
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,733
He pissed himself on
the way to practice.

82
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,142
- He was six.

83
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,333
It wasn't, like, recently.

84
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,833
He did my homework for me.

85
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,600
And I helped him.

86
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,366
We made a deal.

87
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:45,700
- And you've been
together ever since, huh?

88
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:47,609
- Yeah.

89
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:49,266
We like each other.

90
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,900
- That's nice.

91
00:09:54,866 --> 00:09:56,533
- It's like...

92
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,633
What's the word for when...

93
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:03,976
You know, those rhinoceroses
and the little birds

94
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,642
live on them and eat the
bugs off the skin...

95
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,109
- Symbiotic.

96
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:09,633
- Yeah, that.

97
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,966
I'm the rhino.

98
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,666
And the bird...

99
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:24,333
- I'm sorry.

100
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:30,276
So what about you.

101
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,442
What do you want to do?

102
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,576
Any ideas?

103
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,566
Anything you'd like to do?

104
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:39,500
- No.

105
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,100
I don't know.

106
00:10:44,366 --> 00:10:46,266
Haven't figured that out yet.

107
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,142
- Well that's okay.

108
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,909
Not really.

109
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:51,633
- It's normal.

110
00:10:58,566 --> 00:11:00,933
Do your homework, Luke.

111
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:06,700
Stop! You have to study!

112
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:21,242
I remember, when we
were in third grade,

113
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:23,866
we had to write autobiographies.

114
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:27,409
Jonah asked his parents
what he was like

115
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,433
when he was a baby.

116
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,809
They talked about it and decided

117
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:36,300
that it would be a good time
to tell him he was adopted.

118
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:38,976
They thought he'd be upset

119
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,033
or that he'd feel
unwanted or angry.

120
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,733
I think he was relieved.

121
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:53,833
He said his parents told
him he was special.

122
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,633
He was a gift from God.

123
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,566
I guess that's what most
parents tell their kids.

124
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:03,933
"You're special."

125
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:06,233
"You're a gift from God."

126
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,700
"You can do anything
you set your mind to."

127
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:18,933
Before that, he was lonely, would
sit by himself at lunches.

128
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:22,609
He asked people why
they didn't like him,

129
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:24,700
why he didn't fit in.

130
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:26,766
He wanted to.

131
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,133
Then all of the
sudden, he was fine.

132
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,166
He'd been lonely.

133
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:39,233
Now, he was just...

134
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,700
alone.

135
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:46,366
And he understood why.

136
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,866
He wasn't meant to be here.

137
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And he knew, one
day, he would leave.

138
00:19:23,233 --> 00:19:24,666
- Fine.

139
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:29,766
They said it'd be three thousand
dollars, parts and labor.

140
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:32,833
It's more than she's
worth, apparently.

141
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,309
Maybe you wanna trade her in.

142
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,833
Get something you
can actually drive.

143
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,833
- I'll fix her.

144
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,442
Seems like a lot to
pay for college.

145
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:03,842
Well, he wants to leave home,

146
00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:05,376
so I said fine, do whatever.

147
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,509
Get the loan. I don't care.

148
00:20:06,533 --> 00:20:08,042
I ain't paying for it.

149
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:10,842
You sure you want to go
all the way up north?

150
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:12,609
That's what he decided.

151
00:20:12,633 --> 00:20:14,009
It's cold up there.

152
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:15,442
Hey, Luke!

153
00:20:15,466 --> 00:20:19,342
Connecticut, New York,
wherever, Detroit.

154
00:20:19,366 --> 00:20:21,576
They're very cynical.

155
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,509
Think they're better
than everybody else.

156
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:25,176
- Well, he'll fit right in.

157
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,576
- That's what I think, anyway.

158
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,409
I don't know.

159
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:29,842
You know Suzi's son.

160
00:20:29,866 --> 00:20:31,109
He went off to college,

161
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:33,242
spent a whole lot of
money on a good school.

162
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,576
Where is he now?

163
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,509
Right here, right back
where he started from,

164
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:37,876
waiting tables.

165
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,409
Where'd all that money get him?

166
00:20:39,433 --> 00:20:40,442
Nowhere.

167
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:42,033
It's just a total waste.

168
00:20:43,466 --> 00:20:45,042
Casserole.

169
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:47,366
What you been doing
since school's out?

170
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,209
- Work.

171
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:50,609
Summer school.

172
00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:53,176
They made you take
summer school?

173
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,376
- Yeah.

174
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,642
Failed a couple things.

175
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,009
Well, that's all right.

176
00:20:57,033 --> 00:20:58,642
You tried your best.

177
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,576
- Not smart like
that son of yours.

178
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,642
- Well, now smart
isn't everything.

179
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:06,709
You know, I saw a bumper sticker
the other day, on a car.

180
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:10,076
It said, "my son's not
on the honor roll",

181
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,142
"but I'm proud of him anyway."

182
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:17,000
And I thought to myself,
yeah, that is so true.

183
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:24,600
- Hey, dad.

184
00:21:33,566 --> 00:21:35,376
Forget your mom.

185
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,333
She means well.

186
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:39,409
She just...

187
00:21:39,433 --> 00:21:42,300
doesn't think before
she talks some times.

188
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,409
She says I think too much.

189
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:45,709
She says you can't enjoy life

190
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:48,533
if you spend too much
time thinking about it.

191
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,100
- Maybe.

192
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:10,233
The truth is, I idolize him.

193
00:36:11,266 --> 00:36:13,766
I think he's perfect.

194
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:19,500
I think, I would give
up everything for Luke.

195
00:36:21,233 --> 00:36:24,009
We both have no idea
where we're headed,

196
00:36:24,033 --> 00:36:27,500
what we'll do,
what we'll become.

197
00:36:28,433 --> 00:36:32,866
But it tortures me,
and he moves forward.

198
00:36:35,133 --> 00:36:37,709
A few days ago, I was
talking to my dad,

199
00:36:37,733 --> 00:36:41,309
and I asked him, if
he could go anywhere,

200
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:42,866
where would it be?

201
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,200
And he said, "I'm
fine right here."

202
00:36:47,633 --> 00:36:53,376
I asked him, "Don't you want to see
other places, or other countries?"

203
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,966
And he said, "There's enough
to see right here in America."

204
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,809
It's funny.

205
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:03,676
Some people feel so
comfortable in one place,

206
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,200
and others feel trapped.

207
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:08,476
An old cliche:

208
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,766
"the grass is always greener
on the other side."

209
00:37:12,266 --> 00:37:14,009
But not for everyone.

210
00:37:14,033 --> 00:37:16,366
Not for some people.

211
00:37:16,866 --> 00:37:18,909
Some people, I've found,

212
00:37:18,933 --> 00:37:21,533
prefer the shade of
their own backyard.

213
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:27,200
To want something
different is, maybe,

214
00:37:27,733 --> 00:37:31,833
to want to be
frightened or unhappy.

215
00:37:32,566 --> 00:37:35,633
To know that you are not
a part of any order...

216
00:37:35,933 --> 00:37:40,376
no community, no home,
and to move forward,

217
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,566
never at peace, from
one thing to the next.

218
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:49,309
I think of the animals in
the yards and farms nearby,

219
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,833
horses, cows.

220
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:55,066
What a happy life.

221
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,742
Quiet.

222
00:37:56,766 --> 00:38:00,933
Resigned to the day-to-day,
in a single space.

223
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:04,742
Same grass, same sky.

224
00:38:04,766 --> 00:38:06,500
Oblivious.

225
00:38:06,866 --> 00:38:10,442
No thoughts of a higher
power, or tomorrow,

226
00:38:10,466 --> 00:38:14,266
or another place, or
of anything else.

227
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:21,233
I think: what a gift.

228
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,566
What peace.

229
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:33,800
- They're on me.

230
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,633
He likes you.

231
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,542
That boy.

232
00:39:14,566 --> 00:39:16,109
No, he doesn't.

233
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:17,833
Of course he does.

234
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:19,800
Why wouldn't he?

235
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,666
Trying to get rid of me?

236
00:39:25,566 --> 00:39:27,066
- No.

237
00:39:39,233 --> 00:39:41,666
- I don't want to be
with anybody else.

238
00:40:17,433 --> 00:40:18,509
No.

239
00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:20,509
Here.

240
00:40:20,533 --> 00:40:22,966
You can't do this, because...

241
00:40:24,433 --> 00:40:26,476
You can't factor four
out of the whole thing.

242
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,242
Only the top.

243
00:40:28,266 --> 00:40:33,266
So you do four, X,

244
00:40:33,366 --> 00:40:38,266
plus four over eight X.

245
00:40:41,766 --> 00:40:43,233
Get it?

246
00:40:51,266 --> 00:40:53,000
- A couple hours.

247
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,533
- I didn't know whether to
put him on the team or not.

248
00:43:23,733 --> 00:43:27,233
His father says he needs
physical activity.

249
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,466
I was just afraid he's
get his feelings hurt.

250
00:43:32,666 --> 00:43:35,533
He's so much smaller
than the other kids.

251
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,466
He seems to be having
a good enough time.

252
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:43,066
I guess that's what matters.

253
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,233
- Ahh!

254
00:43:52,533 --> 00:43:54,066
That's okay.

255
00:44:08,133 --> 00:44:09,933
Keep your eye on the ball.

256
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,833
You got it?

257
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,433
Ready?

258
00:44:25,533 --> 00:44:26,876
My dad said he would help me

259
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,200
with the down-payment on a car.

260
00:44:30,466 --> 00:44:35,133
He said I needed something
sturdy, Japanese...

261
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,766
He said America can't keep up.

262
00:44:40,766 --> 00:44:43,809
Something used with
a few miles on it,

263
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:46,133
but something that would drive.

264
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,876
And someone will take my old car

265
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,100
for a few thousand dollars,

266
00:44:54,533 --> 00:44:56,733
and I'll take someone else's.

267
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:06,133
And I started to
think about Jonah,

268
00:45:07,066 --> 00:45:12,066
and about his birth
mother, and his mom,

269
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:17,866
and passing him from one
person to the next,

270
00:45:18,533 --> 00:45:21,866
and wanting him to be mine.

271
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:29,766
So I bought a camera, and
I took pictures of him.

272
00:45:32,766 --> 00:45:36,276
Jonah said he heard a quote
somewhere that said,

273
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,666
"if it wasn't photographed,
it never existed."

274
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:43,400
I don't know who said it.

275
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,600
He's full of quotes.

276
00:45:48,166 --> 00:45:50,700
I call him a smarty-pants.

277
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:55,676
He said, "They're not my ideas."

278
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,700
"They're other people's."

279
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,266
"I'm just borrowing them."

280
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:11,409
The music you were
playing sounded nice.

281
00:48:11,433 --> 00:48:12,700
Thanks.

282
00:48:13,233 --> 00:48:15,042
That something you come up with?

283
00:48:15,066 --> 00:48:16,600
No.

284
00:48:16,966 --> 00:48:19,133
Thought you might've wrote it.

285
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,233
I need to dust your room.

286
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:23,900
Fine.

287
00:48:25,566 --> 00:48:27,876
You doing anything today?

288
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:31,766
Picking up Luke when
he's done with work.

289
00:48:32,766 --> 00:48:34,600
What y'all gonna do?

290
00:48:35,566 --> 00:48:36,409
- I don't know.

291
00:48:36,433 --> 00:48:38,342
What is there to do?

292
00:48:38,366 --> 00:48:39,742
I mean...

293
00:48:39,766 --> 00:48:42,509
You gonna have to
split up, or...?

294
00:48:42,533 --> 00:48:43,800
- Oh.

295
00:48:44,033 --> 00:48:45,333
No.

296
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,033
I'd hate to see that happen.

297
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,766
I don't want to talk about it.

298
00:48:51,266 --> 00:48:53,600
You don't have to get upset.

299
00:48:57,633 --> 00:48:58,809
It's okay.

300
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:00,776
You're gonna be okay.

301
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,842
Make new friends, keep the old.

302
00:49:02,866 --> 00:49:05,600
One's silver, the other's gold.

303
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,009
I don't know, Jonah.

304
00:49:11,033 --> 00:49:12,409
It's just a saying.

305
00:49:12,433 --> 00:49:13,742
- It's stupid.

306
00:49:13,766 --> 00:49:15,733
It doesn't mean anything.

307
00:49:20,233 --> 00:49:22,233
- I'm not stupid.

308
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,100
I never said...

309
00:49:25,633 --> 00:49:27,500
- I'm your mother.

310
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,466
- I made my mother cry.

311
00:51:01,666 --> 00:51:02,933
Eh...

312
00:51:03,533 --> 00:51:05,233
She cries easy.

313
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,633
- Yeah.

314
00:51:10,666 --> 00:51:12,633
I feel very...

315
00:51:13,533 --> 00:51:15,800
unrelated to them.

316
00:51:31,066 --> 00:51:33,766
She asked me if we
were staying together.

317
00:51:36,133 --> 00:51:37,966
- Fingers crossed.

318
00:51:39,433 --> 00:51:41,066
- I don't know.

319
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,542
I think she'd rather
us stay together

320
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:44,600
if it meant I'd stay.

321
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:47,900
- She just wants to torture
you for a couple more years.

322
00:51:49,433 --> 00:51:50,733
- Yeah.

323
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,242
There you go.

324
00:55:05,266 --> 00:55:06,966
Signed by the whole team.

325
00:57:47,966 --> 00:57:50,500
- I wish you'd ask me not to go.

326
00:57:52,266 --> 00:57:54,000
Too late now.

327
00:57:55,466 --> 00:57:57,176
- I could change my mind.

328
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,733
- Stop it.

329
00:58:01,933 --> 00:58:03,800
- It'd be simpler.

330
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,400
I'm scared.

331
00:58:14,966 --> 00:58:16,400
Don't be.

332
00:58:17,133 --> 00:58:18,900
You can always come back.

333
00:58:19,966 --> 00:58:22,333
This place isn't going anywhere.

334
00:58:32,433 --> 00:58:34,633
- I'm not going anywhere either.

335
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,166
- I don't know why I
have to be like this.

336
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,209
I don't know why I
can't just care

337
00:58:46,233 --> 00:58:48,909
about the things everyone
else cares about.

338
00:58:48,933 --> 00:58:50,400
Like what?

339
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,433
- I don't know.

340
00:58:52,766 --> 00:58:54,333
Barbecues?

341
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,866
- Yeah.

342
00:59:03,733 --> 00:59:05,833
- Please tell me not to go.

343
00:59:11,933 --> 00:59:13,200
- No.

344
00:59:28,166 --> 00:59:30,033
- I wish you would.

345
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,800
- Tough.

346
00:59:37,733 --> 00:59:39,300
Tough luck.

347
00:59:40,266 --> 00:59:41,966
Not gonna happen.

348
01:05:29,966 --> 01:05:31,609
Jonah read me a line from a book

349
01:05:31,633 --> 01:05:33,266
he was reading.

350
01:05:34,366 --> 01:05:37,333
It said, "Happiness
serves little purpose",

351
01:05:37,633 --> 01:05:40,766
"except that it makes
unhappiness possible."

352
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:46,142
I once asked my dad how you know

353
01:05:46,166 --> 01:05:48,800
you've found the right person,

354
01:05:49,533 --> 01:05:53,433
and he said, "You just know."

355
01:05:54,233 --> 01:05:57,533
"You find someone you
don't mind being around,"

356
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:02,800
"going places with, watching a
movie, sleeping next to..."

357
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,800
"Someone who isn't like you,"

358
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:12,233
"someone who makes you better,"

359
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:17,433
"who you forgive for
being different,"

360
01:06:18,133 --> 01:06:21,433
"for not seeing the world
the way you see it."

361
01:06:25,766 --> 01:06:27,766
We'll try,

362
01:06:28,766 --> 01:06:31,366
see if things can last.

363
01:06:34,933 --> 01:06:37,200
But things don't last.

364
01:06:38,933 --> 01:06:41,033
He'll meet other people,

365
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:44,033
much more interesting than me.

366
01:06:47,166 --> 01:06:48,866
And they'll love him.
