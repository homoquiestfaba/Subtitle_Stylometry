My drama department
was invaded by outsiders.

181
00:12:55,068 --> 00:12:58,057
Singers came from the
Chemistry lab and the locker room.

182
00:12:58,075 --> 00:13:00,009
Shockingly.
Sis.

183

That's insulting, I need more!

218
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:50,053
I need, I need,

219
00:15:51,038 --> 00:16:02,096

I like what I see, I like it a lot
Is this absolutely fabulous?

222
00:16:17,008 --> 00:16:18,068
Absolutely

223
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:26,027
NOT!

224
00:16:42,048 --> 00:16:44,074
I got you, i got you its ok

225
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:51,079
What are you doing here?
i am the new lifeguard.

226
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,031
Wait! are you a member here?

227
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:09,066
I told you to hire Troy Boltan
not the entire East High student body.

228
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:15,000
You told me to hire Troy Bolton
whatever it takes!

229
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:17,095
Well why didn't you warn me
that i have the rest of them?

230
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:22,020
I did discuss the matter with
the Lava Springs board, of course.

231
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:25,074
by the board, you mean our....

232
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:27,060
....MOTHER!

233
00:17:32,082 --> 00:17:36,055
Gabriella Montez and the Wildcats!
Mother, how could you?

234
00:17:36,073 --> 00:17:39,053
Think of your future kid,
these are your school chums....

235
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,000
.... not the fuddy duddy Lava Springs staff.

236
00:17:42,017 --> 00:17:47,094
These are not my chums.
They will steal my talent show.

237
00:17:48,011 --> 00:17:51,068
and what fresh talent you
will have for your summer show?

238
00:17:51,087 --> 00:17:55,003
Mother!
Did you hear what i just said?

239
00:17:57,077 --> 00:18:01,022
Ryan, Talk to Mother!
Hi Mom.

240
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:04,021
Ducky, how is my dashing boy?

241
00:18:10,003 --> 00:18:12,059
Tell pumpkin if she worries to much....

242
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,031
...she will get frown lines.

243
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:16,099
Doh Narnaste!

244
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,088
I want them out!
but your mother...

245
00:18:25,014 --> 00:18:28,011
Specifically said....
Don't mention that backstabbing yokley to me!

246
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:31,067
If you can fire them
make them want to quit.

247
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,083
I am hoping that chef Michael
is going to teach me....

248
00:18:40,003 --> 00:18:42,005
.... the art of Austrian flake pastry.

249
00:18:42,024 --> 00:18:45,003
and Sharpay is going to
be where i work everyday!

250
00:18:45,034 --> 00:18:48,035
How much better can
summer get right? right?

251
00:18:48,068 --> 00:18:50,098
Yeah sounds like a real dream come true
if you actually got to know her....

252
00:18:51,013 --> 00:18:53,037
....i mean Dude!
i didn't even know Sharpays parents....

253
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:56,091
.... owns this place
Mr Fulton just said you know ....

254
00:18:57,009 --> 00:18:59,050
.... there are Wild Cat fans at
Lava Springs and jobs are available.

255
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:02,071
So i said lets go for it!!
Inspiring, Mr Bolton.

256
00:19:02,085 --> 00:19:06,044
Truly inspiring, but
what we are looking for from all of you,

257
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:11,011
is not inspiration.
Its perspiration.

258
00:19:11,078 --> 00:19:17,066
Confirming assignments.
Bolton, Danforth will be waiters.

259
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:23,032
and when needed Caddies.
what?

260
00:19:23,064 --> 00:19:27,000
Miss McKessie, i am told
that you are efficient

261
00:19:27,087 --> 00:19:30,073
Prove it you will handle
member activities.

262
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:33,086
keep me advised at all times!
Kelsi ha!

263
00:19:34,004 --> 00:19:35,026
Piano.

264
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:40,034
Lunch time and cocktail hour
that means mood music.....

265
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,051
....not new music, got it?

266
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,063
Martha, chopping, cutting...

267
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:49,090
preparing plates.
Do complete the summer with the equal amount of digits....

268
00:19:50,008 --> 00:19:53,062
.... i assume that you currently possess
Zeke!

269
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:57,099
You will assist chef Michaels in the.....
(under breath) the promised land!

270
00:19:58,015 --> 00:20:01,024
You hold on to that!
Mr Fulton, your Excellency Sir.

271
00:20:01,045 --> 00:20:05,046
Would it be ok if we draw straws to see who wait on Sharpay?

272
00:20:05,065 --> 00:20:09,053
Please, none of you will
be waiting on Sharpay!....

273
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:13,004
You will be serving Miss Evans.
Who is that?

274
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:18,069
Always address our members
as Mr, Mrs or Miss!!! (Laughs)

275
00:20:18,085 --> 00:20:20,036
Right shall we?
(Whispers)I dont know.

276
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,094
Miss Evans, would you care for a lemonade?

277
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:27,036
Actually i am not miss Evans.
Im Jason.

278
00:20:30,054 --> 00:20:34,036
Oh it smells so good and
i am so hungry, what’s for lunch?

279
00:20:34,052 --> 00:20:40,014
Miss Montez, it would seem your lunch break
doesn't start for another 3.5 minutes.

280
00:20:40,034 --> 00:20:43,030
Did you hope no members
would drown in your absence?

281
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:49,053
Henceforth do remember to clock in
and out on time because 3 infractions of any kind,

282
00:20:49,077 --> 00:20:54,025
and your employment
is terminated, Got it?

283
00:20:59,012 --> 00:21:01,019
Ok that man officially scares me.

284
00:21:01,044 --> 00:21:04,034
Suddenly i am beginning to
miss detention with Miss Darbus.

285
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:08,018
How sick is that?
Come on we have a hoop out back,

286
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:12,000
2 to 3 meals a day and
we only have to wear these stupid outfits on duty.

287
00:21:12,015 --> 00:21:15,083
All for one and one for all?,
This is our summer.

288
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:19,095
What team? WILDCATS!
What team? WILDCATS!

289
00:21:20,017 --> 00:21:20,088
Now come on.

290
00:21:21,005 --> 00:21:24,074
How did we get from the top of the World
to the bottom of the heap?

291
00:21:24,095 --> 00:21:28,055
I don’t recall you mentioning
the boss is such a creep

292
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:32,049
We still have the ingredients to
make this summer sweet

293
00:21:32,072 --> 00:21:36,090
Well, i got rags instead of riches
And all these dirty dishes

294
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:42,019
Just wish i had three wishes
(Okay guys, break it up)

295
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:45,099
We've got to work, work, to work this out

296
00:21:46,016 --> 00:21:49,080
We'll make things right,
the sun will shine

297
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,081
If we work, work there'll be no doubt
We can still save the summer

298
00:21:57,002 --> 00:21:59,071
If we work this out!

299
00:21:59,086 --> 00:22:02,004
(Dude, what have you gotten us into?)

300
00:22:02,025 --> 00:22:05,008
(Come on, we can totally turn this thing around)

301
00:22:06,017 --> 00:22:09,074
I'd rather face a seven footer straight up in the post

302
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:14,029
That sure beats hangin' here, And burning someone’s toast.

303
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:18,013
I needed Benjamins, but this ain't worth the stress

304
00:22:18,034 --> 00:22:21,082
Maybe there's a better way to fix this greasy mess

305
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:25,064
We're a champion team,
a well-oiled machine,

306
00:22:25,086 --> 00:22:29,065
and we've faced tougher
problems than this.

307
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:33,070
I know it's a grind, but
I’m sure we can find

308
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:37,063
a way to have fun while
we get this job done.

309
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:41,019
We've got to work, work
to work this out

310
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,000
We'll make things right
the sun will shine

311
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:48,066
If we work, work
there'll be no doubt

312
00:22:48,091 --> 00:22:55,029
We can still save the summer
If we work this out!!

313
00:22:56,067 --> 00:22:57,084
(Let's work it!)

314
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:24,078
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need

315
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:27,002
A little bit of sugar
A little bit of butter

316
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,061
It's the perfect recipe!
Pay day!

317
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,063
It'll taste so sweet
Pay Day!

318
00:23:31,085 --> 00:23:34,095
Good enough to eat
Gonna make some motion pictures

319
00:23:35,016 --> 00:23:37,005
Hit the mall with all my sisters

320
00:23:37,024 --> 00:23:39,006
Get tickets to the Knicks and Sixers

321
00:23:39,027 --> 00:23:40,098
Kick it with the music mixers

322
00:23:41,015 --> 00:23:42,097
Buy a ride that suits my style

323
00:23:43,015 --> 00:23:46,080
Lounge around the pool and while
Make a date with my favorite girl

324
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,095
We've got it made!

325
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:53,072
We've got to work, work
to work this out

326
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:57,082
We'll make things right,
the sun will shine

327
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:04,073
If we work, work
there'll be no doubt
We can still save the summer

328
00:24:04,093 --> 00:24:11,006
If we work this out!
Work This!
Gotta Work This!

329
00:24:11,055 --> 00:24:12,073
We can work this out!

330
00:24:15,092 --> 00:24:17,050
Can we work this out?

331
00:24:18,067 --> 00:24:19,074
Yeah we can work it out!

332
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,094
Waiters all in.

333
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,031
Miss me?

334
00:24:41,034 --> 00:24:42,078
Of course she did.

335
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:46,095
Have you ever been on the golf course?
Some employees,

336
00:24:47,011 --> 00:24:49,032
Troy, not members.
and i don't play golf.

337
00:24:49,046 --> 00:24:51,037
Who said anything about golf?

338
00:24:56,057 --> 00:24:58,071
Are you sure its ok
for us to be out here?

339
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,014
Yeah unless the jack rabbits turn us in.

340
00:25:03,017 --> 00:25:04,099
So how is kitchen duty?

341
00:25:05,016 --> 00:25:08,012
Well you know the team that
washes dishes together, wins together.

342
00:25:11,067 --> 00:25:14,038
My mom says summer jobs
are good on college applications.

343
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:17,015
All part of the frightening
concept called our future.

344
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:19,013
Are you worried?

345
00:25:21,034 --> 00:25:23,049
Hey.... college costs a fortune.

346
00:25:23,097 --> 00:25:26,053
My parents are saving pennies
unlike the people at this place.

347
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:27,064
your certain for a scholarship

348
00:25:27,086 --> 00:25:31,006
Im only as good as what
happens next season.

349
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,068
I always liked the idea of
being in charge of my future.

350
00:25:34,084 --> 00:25:38,067
Until it actually started happening.
So just think about right now.

351
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:42,023
I have never been in one place
for an entire summer.

352
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:46,006
It means a lot to me.
especially being here with....

353
00:25:46,022 --> 00:25:49,090
an outstanding peanut butter
and jeally sandwich maker like me?

354
00:25:50,051 --> 00:25:52,052
I want to remember this summer, Troy.

355
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:55,054
Here, Catch.

356
00:25:55,077 --> 00:25:57,016
Awww i love this game.

357
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,022
Ready?
Go.

358
00:26:01,052 --> 00:26:03,003
beautiful.
YES!

359
00:26:04,051 --> 00:26:05,035
Your turn.

360
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:11,054
You didn't get a single one.
You....

361
00:26:11,085 --> 00:26:12,070
That was so bad.

362
00:26:15,064 --> 00:26:21,022
Fulton, when i was in the fourth fairway/N today it seemed bone dry.

363
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,057
No way!

364
00:26:24,054 --> 00:26:28,042
Can you tell maintenance to gibe it an extra splash?

365
00:26:43,017 --> 00:26:44,002
No way.

366
00:26:47,032 --> 00:26:50,022
May i have this dance?
why of course you may!

367
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:51,064
Lets go then.

368
00:26:54,091 --> 00:26:58,004
It's soooo WET!

369
00:27:07,004 --> 00:27:09,052
Keep an eye on them tomorrow
and keep me posted.

370
00:27:09,077 --> 00:27:12,063
Why are you smiling?
No worries, Ryan.

371
00:27:12,085 --> 00:27:16,006
This is out turf. remember?

372
00:27:16,023 --> 00:27:20,067
First a break time infraction
and now frolicking on the golf course.

373
00:27:20,087 --> 00:27:26,081
We are not off to a very good start are 
we Miss Montez?
Actually Mr Fulton this was my idea.

374
00:27:26,097 --> 00:27:30,012
How Gallant, but irrelevant.

375
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:33,015
We wont allow this to
happen again will we?

376
00:27:40,016 --> 00:27:43,072
Morning everybody.
That smells good!, that smells good!

377
00:27:56,031 --> 00:27:57,057
Come on its ready

378
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:04,018
You are the music in me.
Sounding good Kelsi.

379
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:08,009
Thanks, actually i gotta get
ready for the ladies luncheon.

380
00:28:08,025 --> 00:28:10,041
Wont exactly be rocking out but....

381
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,058
You know i am so excited
about the club talent show.

382
00:28:13,074 --> 00:28:15,056
Employees get to do a number,

383
00:28:15,074 --> 00:28:18,018
and i have ideas for everyone.
you guys can sing the lead,

384
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:21,042
Zeke and Chad can do backup.
and everyone can dance.

385
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:23,094
Big time out on that one,
my singing career began....

386
00:28:24,011 --> 00:28:26,016
.... and ended with the 
East High Winter Musical.

387
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:28,088
Im just here to make a cheque
and sneek into the pool after work.

388
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,070
Thats really it.

389
00:28:32,006 --> 00:28:35,072
What was that you were playing a minute ago?
Oh its nothing.... just nothing.

390
00:28:35,087 --> 00:28:40,000
Whats this?
I was thinking if you do the show.

391
00:28:40,021 --> 00:28:43,071
I wanted to be ready.
i wrote this for you guys.

392
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:46,050
Come on. Go.

393
00:28:54,044 --> 00:28:57,056
You are the music in me

394
00:28:58,095 --> 00:29:02,033
You know the words Once Upon A Time

395
00:29:02,052 --> 00:29:07,008
Make you listen. There's a reason.

396
00:29:08,055 --> 00:29:12,000
When you dream there's a chance you'll find

397
00:29:12,018 --> 00:29:17,023
A little laughter or a happy ever after

398
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:21,063
Your harmony to the melody

399
00:29:21,086 --> 00:29:26,013
It's echoing inside my head

400
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:34,013
A single voice (Single voice) 
Above the noise And like a common thread

401
00:29:34,088 --> 00:29:36,067
Hmm, you're pulling me

402
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:42,082
When I hear my favorite song, 
i know we belong

403
00:29:43,006 --> 00:29:48,079
Oh, you are the music in me, 
Yeah it's living in all of us

404
00:29:49,003 --> 00:29:55,064
And it's brought us here because 
you are the music in me

405
00:30:01,095 --> 00:30:04,086
you are the music in me

406
00:30:05,002 --> 00:30:08,018
It's like I knew you before we met
(Before we met)

407
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:11,088
Can't explain it (Ohh ohh) There's no name

408
00:30:12,006 --> 00:30:17,045
for it (No name for it) 
I'm saying words I never said

409
00:30:17,068 --> 00:30:20,049
And it was easy (So easy)

410
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:23,048
Because you see the real me (I see)

411
00:30:23,067 --> 00:30:32,033
As I am, you understand, 
and that's more than I've ever known

412
00:30:32,057 --> 00:30:40,055
To hear your voice (Hear your voice) Above the noise (Ohh ohh) And no, I'm not alone

413
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,062
And no, I'm not alone

414
00:30:42,097 --> 00:30:48,069
When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong (Yeah ohh)

You are the music in me
It's living in all of us

00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,084
And it's brought us here because
You are the music in me

417
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:06,060
Together we're gonna sing (Yeah)

418
00:31:08,017 --> 00:31:14,051
We got the power to sing what we feel 
(What we feel)

419
00:31:14,073 --> 00:31:19,036
Connected and real
Can't keep it all inside (Ohh)

420
00:31:26,072 --> 00:31:29,064
You are the music in me (In me)

421
00:31:36,004 --> 00:31:39,004
You are the music in me (In me)

422
00:31:39,054 --> 00:31:45,023
When I hear my favorite song 
(Favorite song) I know that we belong 
(We belong)

423
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:51,027
You are the music in me
Yeah it's living in all of us

424
00:31:51,047 --> 00:31:57,087
It's brought us here because (Here because)
You are the music in me

425
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:08,045
You are the music in me

426
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,057
I really love that song.
Great job Kelsi.

427
00:32:16,078 --> 00:32:19,016
I have got the talent show
sign up sheet right here.

428
00:32:19,032 --> 00:32:20,030
Are you in?

429
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:26,071
Maybe we can work this out, but only.....

430
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,010
....if we are all in this together.

431
00:32:30,051 --> 00:32:32,007
This is going to be fantastic.

432
00:32:32,022 --> 00:32:34,064
I will coordinate the rehearsals
coincide with all our schedules

433
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:37,041
Golden Throat,
This is Jazz square.

434
00:32:37,057 --> 00:32:39,021
We may have trouble.

435
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:42,087
Its an amazing song but
kelsi didnt write it for us.

436
00:32:43,007 --> 00:32:45,015
Hi mom
Seaweed scrub, darling?

437
00:32:45,032 --> 00:32:48,003
May be later.
Ryan, it might be wonderful.....

438
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:51,022
.... if Troy participates in our talent show.
WHAT?

439
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:55,047
If he sings with Gabriella then our
whole show will be the Troy and Gabriella show.

440
00:32:55,064 --> 00:32:57,052
Im not certain Gabriella
is ideally suited to help.....

441
00:32:57,071 --> 00:33:00,060
.....Troy realize his true potential
here at Lava Springs.

442
00:33:01,002 --> 00:33:04,015
Mommy, what time is daddy 
going to be here?
We tee off at noon.

443
00:33:04,055 --> 00:33:07,016
Join us?
Love too.

444
00:33:11,071 --> 00:33:15,025
How are we getting to the food today Chad?
I dont know perhaps skipping.

445
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,086
Well then.
Shall We?

446
00:33:21,002 --> 00:33:22,075
Danforth, Bolton.

447
00:33:22,097 --> 00:33:25,092
Your caddying today, 40 dollars a bag.

448
00:33:26,012 --> 00:33:27,025
You have been requested.
What?

449
00:33:27,042 --> 00:33:29,058
By who?
Dude! who cares for 40 bucks....

450
00:33:29,085 --> 00:33:33,089
.... I would caddy for Godzilla.
Close, very close.

451
00:33:36,018 --> 00:33:37,096
Thanks.
Thank you sir.

452
00:33:41,067 --> 00:33:43,004
Hey Boys.
Hey.

453
00:33:43,017 --> 00:33:46,014
Troy, i thought it was time for
you to meet my parents.

454
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:50,010
Ashanti
Awesome.

455
00:33:50,086 --> 00:33:51,094
Hi.

456
00:33:52,058 --> 00:33:53,073
where is your dad?

457
00:34:09,036 --> 00:34:10,023
Hi daddy.

458
00:34:12,007 --> 00:34:14,084
Where is the first tee?
and what is the course record?

459
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,049
Im just kidding i built the course
myself and hold the record

460
00:34:24,066 --> 00:34:27,023
Who is counting?
Princess.

461
00:34:28,001 --> 00:34:31,087
Son, you have been working out.
Yoga.

462
00:34:33,009 --> 00:34:36,003
Bring that around there you go,
quite a season you boys had?

463
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:40,081
Oh Troy played for the golf team to daddy.
Versatile.

464
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:43,008
How about you son?
Baseball, track or field.

465
00:34:43,025 --> 00:34:46,049
Outstanding.
Might come in handy the way i play golf.

466
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,003
Fair Warning.

467
00:34:57,022 --> 00:34:59,047
Brilliant darling, brilliant.

468
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:02,082
Chad, you will be caddying
for mother. Troy.....

469
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,077
....for Daddy.

470
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:07,044
Daddy.

471
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,020
Bravo.
Brilliant. Lets take a walk.

472
00:35:12,067 --> 00:35:15,039
Is that a new outfit?
Yes i got it just this morning and yours?

473
00:35:19,003 --> 00:35:20,022
Come on, Chad.

474
00:35:24,023 --> 00:35:25,021
You think?

475
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:28,081
Well it is 190 to the pin,
down hill lay. Elevated green.

476
00:35:29,009 --> 00:35:30,083
I would go with the full 5, Sir.

477
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:44,000
Nice call.

478
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:52,091
Princess. Grab your pitching
wedge, this ones yours.

479
00:35:53,065 --> 00:35:54,056
Thanks, Daddy.

480
00:35:59,035 --> 00:36:00,038
Line it up.

481
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:13,024
That’s my girl.
That girl needs to take up knitting.

482
00:36:13,043 --> 00:36:15,096
Or some sport where she
can only injure herself.

483
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,007
I’m in the sand.
Me too.

484
00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:26,067
Knees, hips, shoulders, hat.
Good, show me.

485
00:36:28,012 --> 00:36:29,003
Backboard.

486
00:36:31,071 --> 00:36:33,036
Thats my boy.

487
00:36:45,074 --> 00:36:47,048
Where?
We have no idea.

488
00:36:50,095 --> 00:36:53,038
Gabriella, dinner tonight?
Sneek a swim?

489
00:37:04,017 --> 00:37:06,021
Lovely darling, nice.
daddy.

490
00:37:06,036 --> 00:37:09,043
Why not let Troy try a shot?
of course, of course.

491
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:10,094
No i shouldn’t.
Come on.

492
00:37:11,017 --> 00:37:11,098
Are you sure?
YES!

493
00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:15,028
If its ok Mr Evans?
It sure is.

494
00:37:15,061 --> 00:37:17,063
A little to the right.
Thank you.

495
00:37:26,057 --> 00:37:29,006
That’s a beautiful swing.
Really is.

496
00:37:29,024 --> 00:37:32,004
That is a beautiful swing!

497
00:37:33,067 --> 00:37:35,017
That was a awesome.
Thanks, man.

498
00:37:35,048 --> 00:37:37,093
What?
I don't know.

499
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,045
Off we go.

500
00:37:42,064 --> 00:37:46,071
I’m saving up for a car.
I’m saving up for a car.

501
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:06,039
Tiger Woods would have been
proud to make that putt.

502
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:10,021
Its a shame Troy is only
Busing dishes all summer.

503
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,081
Given that he is a potential star.

504
00:38:12,098 --> 00:38:14,080
Ive seen Troy play basketball.

505
00:38:15,005 --> 00:38:18,015
The Red hawks would be
very interested in him.

506
00:38:18,034 --> 00:38:22,094
That’s inspired, daddy.
Troy is very concerned about college.

507
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,039
Really?
How is Coach Bolton these days?

508
00:38:25,054 --> 00:38:27,069
Fantastic.
Outstanding.

509
00:38:31,092 --> 00:38:32,078
What?

510
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:35,072
Next time i see pink cart princess.....

511
00:38:35,091 --> 00:38:38,039
...... I am going to launch her and
her pink cart into the lake.

512
00:38:38,056 --> 00:38:41,033
I will build the ramp, buddy
Danforth, this is a kitchen,

513
00:38:41,047 --> 00:38:43,055
Not a day spa.
you and Jason,

514
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:45,050
suit up for dinner duty
in the dinning room.

515
00:38:45,067 --> 00:38:48,099
Bolton, you have 5 mins to change
and come with me.

516
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,084
In case you’re not familiar
with this particular item,

517
00:38:52,002 --> 00:38:53,087
It goes around your neck.

518
00:38:54,022 --> 00:38:56,065
Like a err...... Dog Collar.

519
00:39:03,066 --> 00:39:06,058
She stepped on a.....
I did not!

520
00:39:06,075 --> 00:39:08,032
Yes, you did.

521
00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:13,086
Hey, here is our superstar.
Troy Bolton, this is Peter.

522
00:39:14,003 --> 00:39:14,079
Peter.
Good to meet you.

523
00:39:14,097 --> 00:39:17,009
This is Claire.... Hello
and you know the family.

524
00:39:18,043 --> 00:39:21,065
He is pretty handy on the fairways
as well as the basketball court.

525
00:39:21,084 --> 00:39:25,013
I bet you worked yourself up quite an appetite
lugging those bags all over the place, huh?

526
00:39:25,036 --> 00:39:27,072
Errr.... yeah just a little bit.
How about we get you some food......

527
00:39:27,089 --> 00:39:29,095
..... then we can talk about your future.
My future?

528
00:39:30,011 --> 00:39:31,079
Yes, sit down.

529
00:39:32,048 --> 00:39:35,085
Daddy is on the board of directors 
at the university of Albuquerque.

530
00:39:36,005 --> 00:39:37,008
So, Troy.

531
00:39:37,028 --> 00:39:40,014
I saw your championship game
and i mean WOW.

532
00:39:40,034 --> 00:39:43,027
That last second shot at the buzzer,
that was outstanding.

533
00:39:43,044 --> 00:39:45,012
Actually my team mates here.

534
00:39:45,026 --> 00:39:47,022
Stole the ball, otherwise
i wouldn’t have had a chance.

535
00:39:47,044 --> 00:39:52,034
Oh you’re much to modest, Troy.
You were voted MVP for the entire season.

536
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:57,089
This year positively screams for a winning season.

537
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,051
Thank you.
Let me get that for you.

538
00:40:05,089 --> 00:40:08,069
They have got a heck of a basketball
program over at the university.

539
00:40:08,086 --> 00:40:10,074
Its got an excellent scholarship
program as well.

540
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:12,054
Scholarship?

541
00:40:12,088 --> 00:40:18,027
Yeah, you know between the two of us here
we pull quite a bit of weight over at the school.

542
00:40:20,035 --> 00:40:24,000
Well time flies when
your are having fun.

543
00:40:24,038 --> 00:40:27,042
But Mr Fulton will probably want
me clocking out at the minute.

544
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,017
Oh come on don’t be silly,
you haven’t even had any dessert.

545
00:40:30,036 --> 00:40:33,007
We haven’t talked about golf yet?
Basketball and golf are just......

546
00:40:33,028 --> 00:40:37,017
..... the beginning of Troy, daddy.
Have you heard him sing?

547
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,070
ohhh a triple threat.

548
00:40:38,095 --> 00:40:42,006
Oh how wonderful, Troy can
participate in the talent show.

549
00:40:42,029 --> 00:40:44,053
Come on, Troy why dont you
give them a sample. Kelsi!

550
00:40:46,082 --> 00:40:51,040
Actually my voice is feeling a little
bit horse tonight. With all the talking but....

551
00:40:51,056 --> 00:40:56,033
...... Thank you very much for the
food and the golf and everything, 
it was amazing.

552
00:40:56,050 --> 00:41:01,073
You will sing some other time wont you,
with me?... promise?

553
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:10,044
Promise.
Perfect.

554
00:41:12,057 --> 00:41:13,042
Dessert?

555
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:37,023
Sorry i am late give
me 2 more minutes.

556
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,017
Nice tie.
Your shoes don’t match though.

557
00:41:40,035 --> 00:41:41,018
Kidding.

558
00:41:47,056 --> 00:41:52,009
Honey, 2 minutes is being late.
but hour? is approaching a felony.

559
00:41:52,026 --> 00:41:54,020
Just because Troy is a nice guy
doesn’t mean he is immune.....

560
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,000
to Boy Disease.
Boy Disease?

561
00:41:56,019 --> 00:41:57,084
Yeah, forgetting things he shouldnt forget.

562
00:41:58,002 --> 00:42:00,005
Now you’re a boy expert?
My older sister,

563
00:42:00,025 --> 00:42:02,015
Has ten rules about
boys behavior.

564
00:42:02,044 --> 00:42:05,037
and 9 of them involve boys forgetting
things they should never forget.

565
00:42:05,054 --> 00:42:09,009
like dinner dates.
Well it wasn’t an official date type of thing.

566
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:13,023
Rule number 3 :
ALL dates are official.

567
00:42:13,042 --> 00:42:15,010
whether the boy knows it or not.

568
00:42:35,008 --> 00:42:37,028
HEY..... Lifeguard!

569
00:42:40,084 --> 00:42:42,065
Your crazy, Wildcat.

570
00:42:43,051 --> 00:42:47,010
Im so late. but i have bought
food a couple of candles.....

571
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:49,072
.... im going to throw a pool side picnic.
what do you say?

572
00:42:49,089 --> 00:42:53,072
Zeke, even made us some desserts.
But first i dare you to jump in.

573
00:42:53,095 --> 00:42:57,063
You know we are not meant
to be in the pool.   ...Club rules!

574
00:43:00,085 --> 00:43:01,078
Cramp!

575
00:43:03,043 --> 00:43:07,002
I need a lifeguard.
Help! Rescue me!

576
00:43:07,073 --> 00:43:08,064
Save me!

577
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:11,045
Here i come!

578
00:43:26,004 --> 00:43:28,072
If your coming in. Follow me.

579
00:43:57,041 --> 00:43:58,021
Listen?

580
00:44:01,073 --> 00:44:02,060
you know.....

581
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,049
....here now with you....

582
00:44:07,015 --> 00:44:09,039
... its finally starting
to feel like summer.

583
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:12,012
Yeah, it is.

584
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:19,027
the water bugs are back!
Look Mr Fulton this was my idea.....

585
00:44:19,046 --> 00:44:22,006
.... she had nothing to do with it.
I generously over looked your....

586
00:44:22,025 --> 00:44:26,006
... Previous break violation, but then came the golf course trip.

587
00:44:26,024 --> 00:44:33,069
and now.... comes this, 2 strikes.
Don’t get a third!

588
00:44:33,095 --> 00:44:35,017
Out of the pool.

589
00:44:40,066 --> 00:44:42,099
Sharpays dad let me play a few holes,

590
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:45,015
and then invited me to dinner
with some of the university board.

591
00:44:45,031 --> 00:44:46,007
Really?

592
00:44:46,024 --> 00:44:47,094
They were talking about scholarships.

593
00:44:48,009 --> 00:44:50,074
While Jason and Chad
were like serving me.

594
00:44:51,062 --> 00:44:53,051
You’re getting paid for it.
its called a job.

595
00:44:53,067 --> 00:44:54,087
You were invited,
There is nothing wrong with that.

596
00:44:55,004 --> 00:44:57,028
I don’t know, it felt weird.

597
00:44:57,074 --> 00:45:00,031
I love that you have got
the team working together.

598
00:45:00,047 --> 00:45:03,022
But your not going to be a Wildcat forever.
The team is now.

599
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:06,081
and that is good but
everyone has there own future.

600
00:45:07,093 --> 00:45:09,035
Im not sure i know what you mean.

601
00:45:13,032 --> 00:45:15,097
Well, when you graduate lots
of people will be chasing....

602
00:45:16,015 --> 00:45:17,042
.... the same opportunities.

603
00:45:17,057 --> 00:45:19,087
There is nothing wrong with
keeping your eye on the prize.

604
00:45:20,007 --> 00:45:23,072
In fact if you don’t, you will get left behind.
Yeah i know, I’m just saying....

605
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:27,093
I didn’t get my friends jobs so they
could sit and watch me eat in the dining room.

606
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:31,066
Im just saying that you should never be ashamed
of attention as long as you have earned it.

607
00:45:31,087 --> 00:45:34,094
A scholarship is special.
That is why there are only a few of them around.

608
00:45:35,011 --> 00:45:36,090
I get it, Dad.

609
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:45,015
So how was the food at Lava Springs?
Insanely good.

610
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:49,052
Take it out for a spin.
No way?

611
00:45:49,069 --> 00:45:52,003
Well you didn’t think i was
going to drive this heap, did you?

612
00:45:56,026 --> 00:45:59,016
Ok, bring those knees up as high
as you can and circle those arms

613
00:45:59,033 --> 00:46:02,055
Hey Water bug.
Last night was so fun,

614
00:46:02,072 --> 00:46:04,050
.... i really didn’t mean to get you in trouble.
Same here.

615
00:46:04,068 --> 00:46:08,058
So maybe later we can have our....
TROY!

616
00:46:11,005 --> 00:46:13,001
So what time is your lunch break?

617
00:46:14,013 --> 00:46:15,085
TROY!

618
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:17,092
Half past 1
Half past 1, great.

619
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:19,068
Cheeseburgers are on me.

620
00:46:19,084 --> 00:46:21,093
Everyone it looks great
Awesome job.

621
00:46:22,008 --> 00:46:23,026
Jumping Jacks!

622
00:46:25,068 --> 00:46:27,062
What is she up too?

623
00:46:28,024 --> 00:46:31,058
Who knows?
Believe me, she does.

624
00:46:35,048 --> 00:46:38,025
I am sorry i am late Mr Fulton.
About the pool thing last night....

625
00:46:38,043 --> 00:46:41,007
...you cant blame Gabriella.
Im promoting you.

626
00:46:41,026 --> 00:46:43,023
Your what?
There is an opening as an assistant....

627
00:46:43,047 --> 00:46:46,062
to golf pros
Salary job, no clocking in,

628
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:50,065
at 500 dollars a week,  plus tips.

629
00:46:51,002 --> 00:46:56,046
What? per week?
Oh my.... That is off the hook.....

630
00:46:57,016 --> 00:46:58,087
... I think it sounds very natural.

631
00:46:59,046 --> 00:47:00,044
Shall we?

632
00:47:08,071 --> 00:47:12,019
Wait so you want me to teach golf?
To kids.

633
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,035
Oh the joy.

634
00:47:13,057 --> 00:47:16,016
Sir, i don’t think
i am qualified.

635
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:19,094
Worry not, just show the little angels
which end of the club to hold,

636
00:47:20,016 --> 00:47:23,079
Tee the ball up and then duck!
In addition,

637
00:47:24,002 --> 00:47:27,005
the board is extending
membership privileges to you.

638
00:47:27,025 --> 00:47:29,059
You have complete use of club facilities.

639
00:47:29,075 --> 00:47:35,014
But do so prudently.
Which means hello wildcats, NOT!

640
00:47:37,037 --> 00:47:38,032
Congratulations.

641
00:47:39,054 --> 00:47:41,097
You will find an appropriate
choice of clothing here.

642
00:47:42,018 --> 00:47:45,018
Do not mix checks with plaids or
blue with browns...

643
00:47:45,035 --> 00:47:47,071
...and above all wearing
white socks at all costs.

644
00:47:47,089 --> 00:47:49,058
Leave you shoes outside you locker.

645
00:47:49,076 --> 00:47:51,033
We will have them polished each evening.

646
00:47:55,035 --> 00:47:56,019
Man.

647
00:47:56,099 --> 00:47:59,085
Save it for the first tee.
To get there.

648
00:48:01,006 --> 00:48:05,083
This might come in handy,
that is the key to your golf cart.

649
00:48:06,005 --> 00:48:11,017
Number 14. The same number
that is on your basketball uniform.

650
00:48:11,036 --> 00:48:13,091
So i am told.
Questions?

651
00:48:14,011 --> 00:48:15,078
How did this happen?

652
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:18,092
It would seem that the evans family
Thinks you have...

653
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:21,014
... Untapped potential.

654
00:48:21,042 --> 00:48:26,055
Young man,
the future is full of uncharted waters.

655
00:48:26,075 --> 00:48:32,000
This family has real pull.
So i suggest you take the ride.

656
00:48:41,025 --> 00:48:42,003
Italian.

657
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:45,039
Awesome junior golfers,
you guys look amazing!

658
00:48:45,056 --> 00:48:50,067
Slow down champ, slow down.
Save some for the other kids.

659
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:53,043
There you go.
Cool shorts, buddy.

660
00:48:54,021 --> 00:48:55,006
Alright.

661
00:48:55,024 --> 00:49:00,009
Hey cutie. Try holding the club that way,
you will hit the ball way further.

662
00:49:02,097 --> 00:49:05,076
Nice back swing, nice back swing killer.

663
00:49:05,096 --> 00:49:07,040
Make the ball fear you.

664
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:10,080
You look good, great job everybody.
GREAT JOB GUYS.

665
00:49:10,099 --> 00:49:12,040
Bolton, Bolton.

666
00:49:12,057 --> 00:49:13,088
Your Half 11 is here
Thanks.

667
00:49:14,006 --> 00:49:14,077
Good luck buddy.

668
00:49:21,057 --> 00:49:22,022
Man!

669
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:25,097
Cool Balls!

670
00:49:26,013 --> 00:49:27,070
Thanks.
Your welcome.

671
00:49:27,088 --> 00:49:31,017
By the end of the summer,
you will have me playing like a pro.

672
00:49:33,018 --> 00:49:35,049
Yeah right, if i live that long.

673
00:49:38,082 --> 00:49:41,037
I am so excited about the show,

674
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:43,032
Dont worry, we will find something great to do.

675
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:48,084
Sharpay, i have already told you.
That singing isnt really my thing.

676
00:49:48,099 --> 00:49:52,005
Here is the best news,
all the Redhawks will be there.

677
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,034
Really?
Of course.

678
00:49:53,054 --> 00:49:55,071
We will lock up your
scholarship with a high C......

679
00:49:55,088 --> 00:49:57,054
....right from centre stage.

680
00:50:00,012 --> 00:50:03,059
We are all in this together, right?
Your parents have been really really nice, Sharpay.

681
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:06,051
Singing with you is not a part of my job.

682
00:50:06,071 --> 00:50:10,015
No. just something you promised to do.

683
00:50:10,044 --> 00:50:11,036
Remember?

684
00:50:14,041 --> 00:50:16,066
You look fabulous in your
new clothes by the way.

685
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:19,061
Do you like the shoes?
There Italian.

686
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:20,062
Nice.

687
00:50:24,025 --> 00:50:25,070
Let me show you
how this is done.

688
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:29,000
Its really easy.
Just line up your target.

689
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,071
Now easy back swing.

690
00:50:31,033 --> 00:50:32,049
Hey Gab!
Hey.

691
00:50:38,061 --> 00:50:41,083
That girl has more moves than an
octopus in a wrestling match.

692
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:45,063
Nah, he knows how to swim.
Yeah, Troy can handle himself.

693
00:50:46,037 --> 00:50:49,021
I did over hear him asking for
her opinion, on his new....

694
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,013
.... Italian golf shoes.
He didn’t ask me.

695
00:50:53,036 --> 00:50:56,030
So wake up sister. She is
basically offering him a college education.

696
00:50:56,051 --> 00:50:58,097
Just so he will sing with
her in the talent show.

697
00:50:59,042 --> 00:51:02,094
Troy would never do that.
You got eyes, use them.

698
00:51:03,017 --> 00:51:05,066
Lets go eat.
Yeah i gotta go.

699
00:51:06,055 --> 00:51:07,093
See you later?
Ok.

700
00:51:09,037 --> 00:51:13,029
You take it back, then through.
Troy, Fulton wants you in the lobby.

701
00:51:13,047 --> 00:51:15,005
Fantastic. Thank you. Cya.

702
00:51:26,056 --> 00:51:29,035
.... And she steps on the ball.....

703
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:33,072
Troy Bolton this is.....
Ive seen them all play for the university.

704
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:37,046
Alright, come scrimmage at our gym.
It will be good for your game.

705
00:51:37,092 --> 00:51:40,089
Play with you guys?
Yeah lets get down, bro.

706
00:51:42,007 --> 00:51:43,083
Awesome
Alright.

707
00:51:44,029 --> 00:51:45,068
Lets all get some awesome lunch.

708
00:51:46,084 --> 00:51:48,054
I knew it, Coral Blue.

709
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:51,091
It is perfect for your skin tone
And mine too.

710
00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:55,070
We are naturally skin tone compatible, Troy
I have no idea what that means.

711
00:51:55,088 --> 00:51:58,065
You don’t need too
I am here for you.

712
00:51:59,062 --> 00:52:01,046
Who’s hungry?
Lets eat!

713
00:52:01,064 --> 00:52:04,062
How can you hit the ball straight
if your club doesn’t trust you?

714
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:08,012
Thats the key. So its all in the grip,
you have to hold it just right.

715
00:52:08,034 --> 00:52:09,063
OOOOO That looks great!

716
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:13,065
I almost forget.
I order Swiss on my burger.

717
00:52:13,084 --> 00:52:15,016
Check it out man and try it.
Alright.

718
00:52:15,032 --> 00:52:18,033
There from the university.
Table 3 needs more ice tea.

719
00:52:19,023 --> 00:52:22,065
No, rotate your hands over the top. Put your
thumb on that side and there you go, man

720
00:52:22,084 --> 00:52:25,068
You good, I will see you on the course.
Yeah lets do it, man.

721
00:52:26,098 --> 00:52:29,065
Zeke, Yo Troy. One swiss.
Coming right up.

722
00:52:30,067 --> 00:52:33,014
I think you’re right, there is a guy out
there who looks just like Trou Bolton.

723
00:52:33,033 --> 00:52:35,036
But i have no idea who he really is.

724
00:52:45,075 --> 00:52:48,051
Kelsi has got some great new ideas
to spice up the talent show.....

725
00:52:48,076 --> 00:52:51,053
Eye on the results.
That new duet that Troy and Gabriella sing.

726
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:52,038
I need it.

727
00:52:52,058 --> 00:52:54,038
Actually its not available.

728
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,062
Repeat.

729
00:52:55,085 --> 00:52:59,010
Its something i wrote for Troy
and Gabriella, just in case they decided.....

730
00:52:59,028 --> 00:53:03,094
Your an employee
Not! a fairy god mother. Lets have it.

731
00:53:05,074 --> 00:53:09,011
Transpose it in to my key.
Troy and I will be doing it in the talent show.

732
00:53:10,023 --> 00:53:13,030
Oh and run up the tempo.
We will need to keep people awake.

733
00:53:13,052 --> 00:53:16,076
What about our song, what about Humuhumuh?
Change of plans.

734
00:53:17,025 --> 00:53:19,090
What am i meant to do with
my tikki warrior outfit?

735
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:22,053
Save it for Halloween,
Go to a luau, or sell it online.

736
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:26,090
Dont know. But in the meantime
keep an  eye on those Wildcats.

737
00:53:27,009 --> 00:53:28,077
If there planning on
being in the show.

738
00:53:28,096 --> 00:53:31,023
Which i doubt, once they
find out about Troy and me.

739
00:53:31,046 --> 00:53:34,058
I don’t want any surprises.
Oh and don’t worry.

740
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:39,011
I will find a song for you somewhere
in the show, or the next show.

741
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:40,037
Really?

742
00:53:42,036 --> 00:53:44,018
Dont strain yourself, Slick.

743
00:53:47,038 --> 00:53:49,067
Entertainers are so temperamental.

744
00:53:50,039 --> 00:53:51,076
Transpose!

745
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:04,007
Look at you!

746
00:54:05,031 --> 00:54:06,018
Go team!

747
00:54:07,032 --> 00:54:09,012
Its a gift from the guys.

748
00:54:09,085 --> 00:54:11,019
The guys?

749
00:54:11,088 --> 00:54:14,033
Oh, you know those tall people.

750
00:54:16,026 --> 00:54:18,011
Look, i have got
to go in a minute.

751
00:54:18,031 --> 00:54:21,015
I will be back within an hour and
i will pick you up in m y new truck.

752
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:23,034
We will go to a movie. I promise.

753
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:28,004
A promise is a really big word, Troy.

754
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:31,078
Yeah, i know.
We also have the staff Baseball game....

755
00:54:31,098 --> 00:54:34,076
.... to work. Remember
that you would play?

756
00:54:34,097 --> 00:54:38,031
Right, Right baseball.
I will absolutely meet you there.

757
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:41,068
You forgot didn’t you?
No, i just got the days mixed up.

758
00:54:41,088 --> 00:54:44,026
Sorry i couldn’t make lunch today.

759
00:54:44,082 --> 00:54:46,008
It’s just been completely wild.

760
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:49,032
You know? I can’t believe how
things are working out here.

761
00:54:49,064 --> 00:54:55,021
I see. Italian golf shoes,
new clothes. Golf carts.

762
00:54:55,043 --> 00:54:58,077
Its crazy stuff. Its hard to
keep track of it all i bet.

763
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:03,004
So what’s your point?  It just doesnt seem like new stuff.

764
00:55:03,084 --> 00:55:05,038
Its like a new Troy.

765
00:55:06,018 --> 00:55:09,069
Alright. Lets see if Tiger Woods
still has a jump shot?

766
00:55:09,087 --> 00:55:12,092
Hey Bolton, come on.
Hey.

767
00:55:13,011 --> 00:55:15,016
Tell them to come over here and mix it up?
We will show them some game.

768
00:55:15,033 --> 00:55:17,069
You know, i don’t think that is how they roll.

769
00:55:17,086 --> 00:55:20,011
How they roll?
No, No that is not what i meant.

770
00:55:20,028 --> 00:55:22,076
Its a closed practice, i am sorry.

771
00:55:23,079 --> 00:55:26,084
Maybe you can get us a video.
Bolton, come on.

772
00:55:27,001 --> 00:55:29,078
I thought we were going to play two on two
after work before the baseball game.

773
00:55:29,094 --> 00:55:32,066
I know, i know man.
I am sorry.

774
00:55:33,067 --> 00:55:37,022
Come on, Zeke that was from yesterday.
When we were all on a team!

775
00:55:38,064 --> 00:55:40,038
Hey, how is it going?

776
00:55:41,075 --> 00:55:43,006
Its my ball.

777
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:50,046
lets go guys.

778
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:54,099
Would you guys be mad at me, if i asked him to
get me one of those cool red jackets?

779
00:55:58,022 --> 00:55:59,077
Hey, come on.

780
00:56:05,089 --> 00:56:09,085
Im so excited about they game.
Hey Ryan!

781
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:11,034
No rehearsals?

782
00:56:11,078 --> 00:56:14,045
Nope, my sister is working
up something new.

783
00:56:14,063 --> 00:56:16,043
So are you coming to the baseball game?

784
00:56:17,029 --> 00:56:18,064
Im not staff.

785
00:56:19,011 --> 00:56:21,087
I wasn’t invited.
Hey, everyone is invited.

786
00:56:22,006 --> 00:56:23,067
Come on, hop in.

787
00:56:24,076 --> 00:56:25,080
Alright.

788
00:56:27,073 --> 00:56:28,063
Are you in.

789
00:56:35,003 --> 00:56:36,030
Hi Martha, Hi Kelsi.

790
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:49,003
What Fulton sent you
here to spy on us?

791
00:56:49,035 --> 00:56:52,056
No, my sister did. She thinks your going
to upstage her in the talent show.

792
00:56:52,074 --> 00:56:55,098
No worries. We were going to do
the show but Troy bailed on us.

793
00:56:56,019 --> 00:56:58,052
Whatever.
What do you mean whatever?

794
00:56:58,074 --> 00:57:00,013
Its our summer, remember?

795
00:57:00,034 --> 00:57:02,054
I thought we decided that
doing the show would be fun.

796
00:57:02,073 --> 00:57:03,084
Well i think so.
Me too.

797
00:57:04,002 --> 00:57:05,079
Who are we kidding?
I dont think so.

798
00:57:05,096 --> 00:57:09,054
We dont know how to put together a show.
But he does.

799
00:57:09,083 --> 00:57:13,041
If we have a real director putting it
together then it would be great.

800
00:57:15,012 --> 00:57:18,005
Have the employees ever won the dazzle award?

801
00:57:18,046 --> 00:57:20,028
No
I know what you can do, Ryan.

802
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:23,078
So why not do it for us?
Do you want to play ball.

803
00:57:24,002 --> 00:57:27,032
Then grab a mitt.
But i don’t dance.

804
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,082
I think that dancing takes some game.

805
00:57:34,009 --> 00:57:35,045
You got game?

806
00:57:35,087 --> 00:57:36,092
A little.

807
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:56,026
Hey pitcher.

808
00:57:59,054 --> 00:58:02,048
Come on, Wildcats.
Get your head in the game.

809
00:58:06,007 --> 00:58:07,003
Lets play ball.

810
00:58:11,042 --> 00:58:16,017
Hey, batter, batter, hey batter, batter swing.
I've go to just do my thing.

811
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:19,020
Hey, batter, batter, hey batter, batter swing.

812
00:58:21,003 --> 00:58:25,040
I'll show you that it's one and the same
Baseball, dancing, same game.

813
00:58:25,057 --> 00:58:30,017
It's easy
Step up to the plate, start swingin.

814
00:58:30,034 --> 00:58:32,070
I wanna play ball now, and that's all.

815
00:58:32,087 --> 00:58:36,052
It ain't no dance that you can show me.

816
00:58:38,031 --> 00:58:40,046
You'll never know it you never try.

817
00:58:40,063 --> 00:58:47,008
There's just one little thing that stops me every time YEAH.

818
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:50,006
Come on!
I don't dance.

819
00:58:50,025 --> 00:58:52,078
I know you can.
Not a chance.

820
00:58:52,096 --> 00:58:55,035
If I could do this, well,you could do that.

821
00:58:55,055 --> 00:58:58,052
But I don't dance.
Hit it out of the park!

822
00:58:58,055 --> 00:59:00,056
I don't dance.
I say you can.

823
00:59:00,077 --> 00:59:04,052
There's not a chance.
Slide home,you score, swingin on the dance floor.

824
00:59:04,071 --> 00:59:09,048
I don't dance,no.
Hey,batter,batter, hey batter,batter swing.

825
00:59:09,069 --> 00:59:14,007
I've go to just do my thing.
Hey,batter,batter, hey batter,batter swing.

826
00:59:16,045 --> 00:59:20,079
Two-steppin, now you're up to bat.
Bases loaded, do your dance.

827
00:59:20,096 --> 00:59:25,039
It's easy
Take your best shot, just hit it.

828
00:59:25,071 --> 00:59:27,072
I've got what it takes, playin my game

829
00:59:27,093 --> 00:59:33,082
so you better spin that pitch you're gonna throw me, YEAH.

830
00:59:34,002 --> 00:59:35,082
I'II show you how I swing.

831
00:59:36,002 --> 00:59:42,081
You'll never know if you never try.
There's just one little thing that stops me everytime.

832
00:59:43,087 --> 00:59:45,034
Come on!
I don't dance.

833
00:59:45,058 --> 00:59:48,008
I know you can.
Not a chance.

834
00:59:48,046 --> 00:59:50,079
If I could do this, well, you could do that.

835
00:59:50,096 --> 00:59:53,070
But I don' dance.
Hit it out of the park!

836
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:56,000
I don't dance.
I say you can.

837
00:59:56,019 --> 01:00:00,006
There's not a chance.
Slide home, you score, swingin on the dance floor.

838
01:00:00,024 --> 01:00:04,075
I don't dance, no.
Lean back, tuck it in, take a chance.

Only in the daylight.

01:03:50,053 --> 01:03:52,062
East side colors

898
01:03:56,002 --> 01:03:57,080
Everyone is excited
about doing the show.

899
01:03:58,003 --> 01:04:01,088
Hey, i know everyone
thinks i am Sharpays poodle.....

900
01:04:02,006 --> 01:04:05,075
If they were thinking that?
There not thinking that today.

901
01:04:07,044 --> 01:04:09,034
How do you do that swing
step you did last night?

902
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:10,034
Thats easy.

903
01:04:18,052 --> 01:04:22,073
I called last night.
I got caught up at the gym.

904
01:04:24,056 --> 01:04:27,028
Hey my dad says your doing great
with those college guys.

905
01:04:27,066 --> 01:04:31,059
Oh yeah, there awesome, playing
them is like ebing in another world.

906
01:04:31,077 --> 01:04:34,028
Well you missed out on a fun night.
It was a great game.

907
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:39,088
But the dessert afterwards
had to be the best part.

908
01:04:40,005 --> 01:04:44,007
Her mum makes the best brownies in the entire world....
Yeah i know, i have had them.

909
01:04:48,088 --> 01:04:50,028
Ill see you guys later.

910
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:10,028
Hey labron, how did it go with the Redhawks?
You know, there very tall.

911
01:05:10,053 --> 01:05:13,049
We got Vince from maintenance to play,
So it all worked out incase your wondering.

912
01:05:13,066 --> 01:05:16,063
Well maybe we can play later today?.
I dont know will have to check with Vince

913
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:20,076
Mr Evans setup the workout not me.
Did you even ask to include us?

914
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:23,090
Captain?
I didn’t go looking for the Redhawks.

915
01:05:24,008 --> 01:05:25,099
The Redhawks came to me.
Ok?

916
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:29,074
I didn’t signup for this golf job.
Fulton offered it and i said yes.

917
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:33,010
It was my decision but i show up
to work the same as you.

918
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:36,019
So chill.
You get a speck of dirt on your pants,
someone dry cleans them.

919
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,053
Don’t say you wouldn’t do the same thing.....
If i was as good as you?

920
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:39,068
No i didn’t say that.
You didn’t have too.

921
01:05:39,086 --> 01:05:42,006
Neither did you.
We didn’t vote you captain,

922
01:05:42,022 --> 01:05:43,076
Because of your jump shots.

923
01:05:43,094 --> 01:05:46,045
We did because you’re the guy
who usually knows what’s up.

924
01:05:46,063 --> 01:05:49,064
But i guess things change.
You think you got me all figured out?

925
01:05:49,081 --> 01:05:51,080
Well i don’t think so.
and i don’t answer to you.

926
01:05:51,098 --> 01:05:54,012
Until you start acting yourself.

927
01:05:55,028 --> 01:05:57,099
We have been like brothers
since pre-school.

928
01:05:58,022 --> 01:06:00,080
If i don’t know who you are
these days, then who does?

929
01:06:01,076 --> 01:06:04,032
Excuse me, but your
all being paid to work.

930
01:06:04,049 --> 01:06:06,033
Not play Doctor Phil.

931
01:06:12,071 --> 01:06:14,043
Table settings are nice.

932
01:06:14,067 --> 01:06:18,063
No, No, No, No, No.

933
01:06:19,014 --> 01:06:20,078
Now that is fabulous.

934
01:06:23,072 --> 01:06:26,067
Daddy will make sure the entire
Scholarship committee is right here.

935
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:29,034
Perfect view.
I have already spoken to your mother.

936
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:32,018
They are going to sitting on
a table right next to ours.

937
01:06:32,052 --> 01:06:33,092
Its going to be a fabulous evening.

938
01:06:34,015 --> 01:06:35,048
Come on
Great.

939
01:06:37,001 --> 01:06:40,014
Rehearsal everyone places, fabulous!

940
01:06:41,008 --> 01:06:43,060
Look, Sharpay. I know i promised that i would do this.

941
01:06:43,077 --> 01:06:47,049
Take it easy on me, i am kind
of new at the whole performing thing.

942
01:06:48,065 --> 01:06:50,066
5, 6, 7, 8...

943
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,052
You are the music in.

944
01:07:02,012 --> 01:07:05,078
You are the music in,
are the music in.

945
01:07:05,098 --> 01:07:08,065
You know the words
Once upon a time,

946
01:07:08,084 --> 01:07:12,053
Make you listen, there’s a reason.

947
01:07:12,074 --> 01:07:15,034
When you dream there
is a chance you will find,

948
01:07:15,053 --> 01:07:19,035
A little laughter or
a happy ever after.

949
01:07:19,055 --> 01:07:26,008
Yeah harmony to the melody
It's echoing inside my head

950
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:29,036
A single voice (Single voice)
Above the noise

951
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:33,033
And like a common thread
Hmm, you're pulling me

952
01:07:33,057 --> 01:07:37,053
When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong

953
01:07:37,076 --> 01:07:42,046
Oh, you are the music in me
Yeah it's living in all of us

954
01:07:42,066 --> 01:07:47,068
And it's brought us here because
Because you are the music in me

955
01:07:51,021 --> 01:07:53,023
You are the music in me.

956
01:07:57,098 --> 01:08:01,094
You are the music in,
you are the music in.

957
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:22,046
yeah harmony to the melody
It's echoing inside my head

958
01:08:29,032 --> 01:08:33,039
When I hear my favorite song

You are the music in me.

962
01:08:53,078 --> 01:08:59,051
You are the music in me.

963
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,097
Great job, just one second.

964
01:09:17,084 --> 01:09:20,035
Good rehearsal, Everybody break!

965
01:09:22,061 --> 01:09:26,012
You know, Troy
I have known you were special.

966
01:09:27,021 --> 01:09:30,006
And its pretty obvious
that i am special too.

967
01:09:30,082 --> 01:09:33,037
I think we are meant to sing together.
Dont you?

968
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,024
I need some air.

969
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:45,093
Dont be long!
We are going to run it again!

970
01:10:08,093 --> 01:10:10,021
Show me what you got!

971
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,028
Come on people.

972
01:10:27,058 --> 01:10:29,059
Now in the front, here we go.

973
01:10:30,032 --> 01:10:31,074
Give it your best.

974
01:10:34,048 --> 01:10:37,015
If you got it flaunt it, that’s it move it.

975
01:10:41,077 --> 01:10:42,088
Keep it going now.

976
01:10:43,006 --> 01:10:44,006
You got it now.

977
01:11:06,071 --> 01:11:07,086
Good Job.

978
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:09,078
That was great, cya!

979
01:11:09,095 --> 01:11:12,004
Thank you.
You’re welcome.

980
01:11:17,083 --> 01:11:19,007
I said keep an eye on them.

981
01:11:19,028 --> 01:11:21,042
Not turn them into
the cast of grease.

982
01:11:21,059 --> 01:11:22,069
Its pretty cool, huh?

983
01:11:23,085 --> 01:11:26,066
Do you want us to lose the star dazzle award....

984
01:11:26,084 --> 01:11:29,019
....to a bunch of dish washers?

985
01:11:30,011 --> 01:11:31,009
Us?

986
01:11:32,044 --> 01:11:34,045
I guess that is show business.

987
01:11:35,044 --> 01:11:37,023
When did you become....

988
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:39,094
.... one of those?

989
01:11:41,045 --> 01:11:43,054
You know i will take that as a compliment.

990
01:11:43,079 --> 01:11:46,047
But you and Troy
have a good show, sis.

991
01:11:49,016 --> 01:11:50,070
Oh we plan too.

992
01:12:00,092 --> 01:12:02,029
Give me a beat.

993
01:12:11,075 --> 01:12:13,079
The midsummer night talent show
means something to me....

994
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:14,095
....and to my family.

995
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:17,096
Those Wildcats will turn it into a farce.

996
01:12:18,013 --> 01:12:21,094
Your brother is one of
those Wildcats, so i am told.

997
01:12:22,011 --> 01:12:24,043
Oh don’t you mention that traitor to us.

998
01:12:24,086 --> 01:12:27,032
Employee involvement
in the show is a tradition here.

999
01:12:27,047 --> 01:12:31,016
Traditions change. My parents have
important guests coming.

1000
01:12:31,037 --> 01:12:33,035
We will need every employee
working the party.

1001
01:12:33,051 --> 01:12:34,086
and not on stage.

1002
01:12:35,002 --> 01:12:38,013
Pardon moi..... but we are not
just talking about employees....

1003
01:12:38,029 --> 01:12:40,035
....were talking about your class mates.

1004
01:12:40,053 --> 01:12:43,005
You might want to think this one out.

1005
01:12:43,034 --> 01:12:44,048
Alright.

1006
01:12:46,015 --> 01:12:47,031
Done.

1007
01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:48,097
Now do it!

1008
01:13:01,087 --> 01:13:06,021
Distribute these in the staff area
but not till the end of shift.

1009
01:13:06,041 --> 01:13:10,055
What? Wait Mr Fulton.
No discussion, Miss McKessie.

1010
01:13:10,076 --> 01:13:15,008
This is a business.
Welcome to the world of adult.

1011
01:13:15,024 --> 01:13:16,060
who wish to keep there jobs.

1012
01:13:16,077 --> 01:13:22,020
They have mortgages they wish to pay,
tuition bills, car payments etc etc etc.

1013
01:13:22,035 --> 01:13:25,069
So sometimes we have to perform tasks no matter how unpleasant.

1014
01:13:25,085 --> 01:13:28,052
That are necessary for that
all to important pay cheque.

1015
01:13:28,068 --> 01:13:31,052
Into our all to empty pockets.

1016
01:13:33,085 --> 01:13:36,001
May i get you a cup of tea, Mr Fulton?

1017
01:13:36,019 --> 01:13:38,085
Chamomile would be lovely.

1018
01:13:44,093 --> 01:13:46,089
Go Martha, Go Martha.

1019
01:13:49,022 --> 01:13:50,069
Could i have your attention please?

1020
01:13:50,085 --> 01:13:52,052
I need to make an announcement.

1021
01:13:53,016 --> 01:13:56,045
All junior staffers will be required
to work on show night.

1022
01:13:56,066 --> 01:13:57,095
What?
What?

1023
01:13:58,013 --> 01:14:00,096
Yes, No staff participation in
the show will be allowed.

1024
01:14:01,015 --> 01:14:02,083
No exceptions.
No show?

1025
01:14:03,003 --> 01:14:04,078
There is a show
we are just not in it.

1026
01:14:04,099 --> 01:14:06,045
This is great.
Sorry you guys.

1027
01:14:06,061 --> 01:14:09,013
There is nothing we can do about it.
Its Mr Fultons orders

1028
01:14:09,031 --> 01:14:11,027
There is no way,
this is Mr Fultons idea.

1029
01:14:11,043 --> 01:14:15,031
Not unless Mr Fulton suddenly has
blond hair and wears designer flipflops.

1030
01:14:16,019 --> 01:14:17,000
Excuse me.

1031
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:38,051
Forget about the rest of us.
How about the fact that your brother,

1032
01:14:38,072 --> 01:14:40,064
Has worked extremely hard on the show?

1033
01:14:40,081 --> 01:14:42,071
Oh Boo Hoo he will be in the show.

1034
01:14:42,093 --> 01:14:45,058
He will do his celebrity impersonations.

1035
01:14:45,075 --> 01:14:47,078
Don’t lecture me about Ryan.

1036
01:14:47,099 --> 01:14:50,010
Given the way you
have been interfering?

1037
01:14:50,028 --> 01:14:52,060
What?
You got him written....

1038
01:14:52,081 --> 01:14:56,004
... up by Fulton for sneaking on the golf course.
Swimming after hours.

1039
01:14:56,023 --> 01:14:59,056
I had to step in just
to save Troy’s job.

1040
01:14:59,073 --> 01:15:00,083
Im not interested in what you...

1041
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:04,016
...think your doing for Troy.
That is between you and him.

1042
01:15:04,031 --> 01:15:06,030
Your messing with my friends,
on my summer.

1043
01:15:06,046 --> 01:15:08,013
That is not ok with me.

1044
01:15:09,001 --> 01:15:12,023
You just don’t like the fact that i..... won.

1045
01:15:12,039 --> 01:15:16,028
What is the prize?
Troy? or the Star Dazzle award?

1046
01:15:16,044 --> 01:15:19,013
To go through all of this
just to get either one?

1047
01:15:19,028 --> 01:15:20,028
No, Thanks Sharpay.

1048
01:15:20,044 --> 01:15:23,034
Your very good at a game that
i dont want to play.

1049
01:15:23,047 --> 01:15:26,097
Im done here. But you better step away from the.....

1050
01:15:27,014 --> 01:15:28,048
.... Mirror long enough to check the damage.

1051
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:31,041
That will always be right behind you.

1052
01:15:36,065 --> 01:15:37,059
Girls!

1053
01:15:43,067 --> 01:15:44,099
Hey, what do you mean your done here?

1054
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,050
You cant quit.

1055
01:15:47,017 --> 01:15:49,036
Us working together sounded good, but....

1056
01:15:49,054 --> 01:15:52,032
....things change and people change.

1057
01:15:52,099 --> 01:15:57,045
The club talent show is a big deal for Sharpay
and evidently for your future.

1058
01:15:57,063 --> 01:16:01,007
Its cool, just make it happen.
Where your new Italian shoes.

1059
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:04,048
Im still me.
Blowing off your friends?

1060
01:16:04,063 --> 01:16:06,099
Missing dates.
If that is you then its good to know.

1061
01:16:07,014 --> 01:16:10,003
No, I am only doing that because
i am working on the scholarship thing.

1062
01:16:10,019 --> 01:16:11,027
You know that.

1063
01:16:11,043 --> 01:16:13,072
What if you along the way you act
like someone your not then pretty soon,

1064
01:16:13,089 --> 01:16:17,027
that is who you will become.
I meant what i said about movies,

1065
01:16:17,044 --> 01:16:20,093
.... and summer and just being together.
Im sure you did.

1066
01:16:21,007 --> 01:16:22,017
At the time.

1067
01:16:23,072 --> 01:16:28,035
I also meant what i said.
That i want to remember this summer.

1068
01:16:28,099 --> 01:16:30,073
Not like this, Troy.

1069
01:16:33,016 --> 01:16:37,097
I gotta say what’s on my mind

1070
01:16:38,023 --> 01:16:43,047
Something about us
doesn’t seem right these days

1071
01:16:43,068 --> 01:16:47,095
life keeps getting in the way

1072
01:16:48,042 --> 01:16:54,041
Whenever we try,
somehow the plan is always rearranged

1073
01:16:54,062 --> 01:16:59,074
Its so hard to say
But I’ve gotta do what's best for me.

1074
01:16:59,092 --> 01:17:03,096
You will be ok..
Ive go to move on,

1075
01:17:04,017 --> 01:17:07,005
and be who I am.

1076
01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:12,034
I just don’t belong here
I hope you understand

1077
01:17:12,057 --> 01:17:17,078
We might find our place in this
world someday

1078
01:17:18,003 --> 01:17:25,057
But at least for now,
I gotta go my own away

1079
01:17:30,005 --> 01:17:33,067
Don’t wanna leave it all behind

1080
01:17:34,067 --> 01:17:40,053
But I get my hopes up
and I watch them fall every time

1081
01:17:40,071 --> 01:17:45,000
Another color turns to grey

1082
01:17:45,018 --> 01:17:51,003
and its just too hard to watch it all
slowly fade away

1083
01:17:51,021 --> 01:17:56,036
I’m leaving today cause I’ve
gotta do what’s best for me

1084
01:17:56,056 --> 01:17:58,037
you will be ok..

1085
01:17:58,059 --> 01:18:03,066
I’ve got to move on
and be who I am

1086
01:18:03,085 --> 01:18:09,013
I just don’t belong here,
I hope you understand

1087
01:18:09,036 --> 01:18:14,052
We might find our place in this
world someday

1088
01:18:14,072 --> 01:18:21,031
But at least for now,
I gotta go my own away

1089
01:18:21,052 --> 01:18:26,091
What about us?
What about everything we have been through?

1090
01:18:27,011 --> 01:18:32,044
What about trust?
you know I never wanted to trust you

1091
01:18:32,062 --> 01:18:37,047
and what about me?
What am I supposed to do?

1092
01:18:37,065 --> 01:18:44,057
I gotta leave but I will miss you
I will miss you

1093
01:18:46,002 --> 01:18:51,015
so
Ive got to move on and be who I am

1094
01:18:51,035 --> 01:18:55,004
Why do you have to go?
I just don't belong here

1095
01:18:55,028 --> 01:18:58,035
I hope you understand
Im trying to understand

1096
01:18:58,058 --> 01:19:03,006
We might find our place in this
world someday

1097
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:07,052
but at least for now
I want you to stay

1098
01:19:07,072 --> 01:19:11,007
I wanna go my own way
I’ve got to move on...

1099
01:19:11,028 --> 01:19:13,093
....and be who I am
What about us?

1100
01:19:14,019 --> 01:19:18,021
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand

1101
01:19:18,039 --> 01:19:21,053
Im trying to understand
We might find our place

1102
01:19:21,073 --> 01:19:24,067
...in this world someday

1103
01:19:24,089 --> 01:19:32,007
but at least for now
I gotta go my own away

1104
01:19:34,011 --> 01:19:44,021
I gotta go my own away
I gotta go my own away

1105
01:20:00,031 --> 01:20:02,032
Usually your taking
these right off the grill.

1106
01:20:02,048 --> 01:20:04,009
Maybe i have been eating
to much at the club.

1107
01:20:04,024 --> 01:20:07,052
You haven’t been out of your room for the past couple of days,
lets call the guys and get a game going.

1108
01:20:07,085 --> 01:20:10,091
They wouldn’t come even if i called.
I find that hard to believe.

1109
01:20:12,082 --> 01:20:13,051
Dad.

1110
01:20:15,043 --> 01:20:17,079
Do i seem different to you this summer?

1111
01:20:17,095 --> 01:20:19,071
You dress a lot better, that’s for sure.

1112
01:20:21,045 --> 01:20:22,048
Im serious.

1113
01:20:23,027 --> 01:20:24,083
Maybe my friends are right,

1114
01:20:24,098 --> 01:20:26,091
Im turning into a jerk with new shoes.

1115
01:20:27,010 --> 01:20:29,074
New shoes, not a new kid.
where is this coming from?

1116
01:20:30,002 --> 01:20:32,068
I have been so focused on my future.

1117
01:20:33,042 --> 01:20:36,046
Gabriella quit.
Chad won’t talk to me.

1118
01:20:36,064 --> 01:20:38,048
I don’t see the Wildcats running around here.

1119
01:20:38,066 --> 01:20:40,030
Is this about going after what you want?

1120
01:20:40,046 --> 01:20:42,055
Yes, Dad. The scholarship is important, i get it

1121
01:20:45,085 --> 01:20:48,089
Look it is only a big deal
if it makes sense to you.

1122
01:20:49,003 --> 01:20:50,095
I don’t even know who i am anymore.

1123
01:20:55,005 --> 01:20:55,090
You know what?

1124
01:20:57,068 --> 01:21:01,009
I have known this kid for a long long time.

1125
01:21:01,078 --> 01:21:03,070
I have a lot of faith in him.

1126
01:21:05,008 --> 01:21:06,059
He looks alot like you.

1127
01:21:08,015 --> 01:21:12,015
I am absolutely sure that he is going to
figure out the right thing to do.

1128
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:32,002
Its ok Ryan can help.
I don’t know.

1129
01:21:32,052 --> 01:21:34,077
We will get it eventually.
Excuse me.

1130
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:08,099
Everybody's always talking at me

1131
01:22:09,021 --> 01:22:12,039
Everybody's trying to get in my head

1132
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:18,065
I wanna listen to my own heart talking
I need to count on myself instead

1133
01:22:18,084 --> 01:22:22,019
Did you ever?
Loose yourself to get what you want

1134
01:22:22,038 --> 01:22:25,072
Did you ever?
Get on a ride and wanna get off

1135
01:22:25,091 --> 01:22:29,017
Did you ever?
Push away the ones you should've held close

1136
01:22:29,034 --> 01:22:33,031
Did you ever let go?
Did you ever not know?

1137
01:22:33,053 --> 01:22:36,074
I'm not gonna stop, that's who I am

1138
01:22:36,095 --> 01:22:40,025
I'll give it all I got, that is my plan

1139
01:22:40,048 --> 01:22:43,063
Will I find what I lost?
You know you can

1140
01:22:43,081 --> 01:22:47,058
Bet on it, bet on it
(Bet on me)

1141
01:22:47,076 --> 01:22:50,083
I wanna make it right, that is the way

1142
01:22:51,002 --> 01:22:54,027
To turn my life around, today is the day

1143
01:22:54,051 --> 01:22:57,055
Am I the type of guy who means what I say?

1144
01:22:57,075 --> 01:23:01,027
Bet on it, bet on it

1145
01:23:01,048 --> 01:23:05,017
How will I know if there's a path worth taking?

1146
01:23:05,037 --> 01:23:08,052
Should I question every move I make?

1147
01:23:08,071 --> 01:23:12,000
With all I’ve lost my heart is breaking

1148
01:23:12,022 --> 01:23:14,077
I don't wanna make the same mistake

1149
01:23:14,098 --> 01:23:18,025
Did you ever?
Doubt your dream will ever come true

1150
01:23:18,046 --> 01:23:21,087
Did you ever?
Blame the world and never blame you

1151
01:23:22,005 --> 01:23:25,029
I will never
Try to live a lie again

1152
01:23:25,049 --> 01:23:29,045
I don't wanna win this game if I can't play it my way

1153
01:23:29,066 --> 01:23:32,093
I'm not gonna stop, that's who I am

1154
01:23:33,019 --> 01:23:36,055
I'll give it all I got, that is my plan

1155
01:23:36,076 --> 01:23:39,076
Will I find what I lost?
You know you can

1156
01:23:39,094 --> 01:23:43,049
Bet on it, bet on it,
Bet on it, bet on it

1157
01:23:43,068 --> 01:23:46,086
I wanna make it right, that is the way

1158
01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:50,047
To turn my life around, today is the day

1159
01:23:50,067 --> 01:23:53,065
Am I the type of guy who means what I say

1160
01:23:53,087 --> 01:23:57,057
Bet on it, bet on it

1161
01:23:58,077 --> 01:23:59,079
Oh, Hold up

1162
01:24:01,067 --> 01:24:02,098
Give me room to think

1163
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:04,088
Bring it on down

1164
01:24:07,089 --> 01:24:09,060
Gotta work on my swing

1165
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:11,043
Gotta do my own thing

1166
01:24:13,004 --> 01:24:14,004
Hold up

1167
01:24:19,035 --> 01:24:26,061
It's no good at all
To see yourself and not recognize your face

1168
01:24:26,078 --> 01:24:31,063
Out on my own, it's such a scary place

1169
01:24:33,031 --> 01:24:37,097
The answers are all inside of me

1170
01:24:38,069 --> 01:24:45,057
All I gotta do is believe

1171
01:24:46,067 --> 01:24:50,008
I'm not gonna stop
Not gonna stop 'til I get my shot

1172
01:24:50,026 --> 01:24:53,089
That's who I am, that is my plan
Will I end up on top?

1173
01:24:54,009 --> 01:24:56,094
You can bet on it, bet on it

1174
01:24:57,011 --> 01:25:00,056
You can bet on it, bet on it

1175
01:25:00,097 --> 01:25:04,009
I wanna make it right, that is the way

1176
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:07,063
To turn my life around, today is the day

1177
01:25:07,084 --> 01:25:10,090
Am I the type of guy who means what I say

1178
01:25:11,009 --> 01:25:15,089
Bet on it, bet on it, You can bet on me

1179
01:25:21,088 --> 01:25:22,072
This way.

1180
01:25:29,018 --> 01:25:30,075
What do you mean your not doing the show?

1181
01:25:30,091 --> 01:25:32,074
Exactly that.
We are singing a duet, Troy.

1182
01:25:32,094 --> 01:25:35,075
A duet means two people.
Well that means mostly me...

1183
01:25:35,091 --> 01:25:38,020
.... in this case, but still a duet.
I am an employee.

1184
01:25:38,038 --> 01:25:40,010
I am not allowed in the show.

1185
01:25:40,027 --> 01:25:43,049
No, No your an honorary member.
Not anymore.

1186
01:25:43,067 --> 01:25:45,081
I asked Mr Fulton for my kitchen job back.
What?

1187
01:25:47,013 --> 01:25:49,038
I dont like the way you have been treating my friends.

1188
01:25:49,054 --> 01:25:51,005
I dont like they way i have been treating them either.

1189
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:53,027
So, I am doing something about it.

1190
01:25:53,042 --> 01:25:57,030
An entire table of university sponsors
are coming to see you.

1191
01:25:57,045 --> 01:25:59,092
Thanks to me.
So i will be there waiter. They will be thrilled.

1192
01:26:00,011 --> 01:26:03,048
Troy, This could change your life.
I am more interested about....

1193
01:26:03,063 --> 01:26:07,021
.... what my friends think of me 
and what i think of myself.

1194
01:26:07,034 --> 01:26:10,026
Oh, we could all hold hands 
around the campfire some other time.

1195
01:26:10,042 --> 01:26:12,032
Right now we have a show to do.
No!

1196
01:26:13,032 --> 01:26:16,083
You have got a show to do.
I have a kitchen to clean.

1197
01:26:21,007 --> 01:26:21,093
It’s ok.

1198
01:26:26,020 --> 01:26:27,076
Kelsi, find Ryan.

1199
01:26:30,072 --> 01:26:32,087
This evening you will be seated at table 21.

1200
01:26:34,007 --> 01:26:35,011
Right this way.

1201
01:26:37,076 --> 01:26:42,058
Now, returning with an abridged version of.....

1202
01:26:42,075 --> 01:26:48,060
.... last years tap dancing epic.
Tina and here tipety tapety toes.

1203
01:27:00,015 --> 01:27:02,036
There you are, thank goodness
you came to your senses.

1204
01:27:02,053 --> 01:27:06,073
Plug in the volcano because humahuma is back on.
Enjoy your pineapple on your own sis.

1205
01:27:06,090 --> 01:27:08,096
Im not doing the show.
What?

1206
01:27:09,012 --> 01:27:11,084
Put some fresh batteries in your
tikki warrior costume and lets get going.

1207
01:27:11,099 --> 01:27:15,036
I took your advice, and sold it online.
You have always wanted the spotlight.

1208
01:27:15,057 --> 01:27:16,081
Now you have got it.

1209
01:27:17,003 --> 01:27:18,020
Break a leg.

1210
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:27,042
The curtain is up.
Its ShowTime.

1211
01:27:39,029 --> 01:27:42,032
Kelsi told us about what went down
between you and Sharpay.

1212
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:46,005
I am more interested in what went down
between me and you, man.

1213
01:27:46,072 --> 01:27:47,069
I was a jerk.

1214
01:27:48,093 --> 01:27:49,068
Yeah.

1215
01:27:50,032 --> 01:27:51,052
Brothers fight.

1216
01:27:52,046 --> 01:27:53,057
but there still brothers?

1217
01:27:59,006 --> 01:28:01,070
Guys, i messed up your show.

1218
01:28:01,094 --> 01:28:05,084
I am sorry.
Yeah because show business is 
our entire lives, right?

1219
01:28:08,011 --> 01:28:10,045
I hope you havent permanently filled my 
spot in the two on two game.

1220
01:28:10,069 --> 01:28:13,097
Ryan, i know how hard you
have worked on the show.

1221
01:28:14,012 --> 01:28:16,073
Making these Wildcats look good 
couldn’t have been easy.

1222
01:28:16,094 --> 01:28:18,058
So i apologies.

1223
01:28:19,059 --> 01:28:22,002
The truth is we have all had a lot of fun.

1224
01:28:22,022 --> 01:28:23,036
At least i have.

1225
01:28:23,065 --> 01:28:26,016
You guys should see him play baseball.

1226
01:28:27,061 --> 01:28:29,005
I'm looking forward to it.

1227
01:28:33,045 --> 01:28:35,088
Troy, listen. All those people out there,

1228
01:28:36,013 --> 01:28:39,021
i dont really want to see my sister crash and burn.

1229
01:28:39,038 --> 01:28:43,076
At least i think i don’t.
You should sing with her.

1230
01:28:48,008 --> 01:28:52,030
My life is over.
I have been a good girl.

1231
01:28:52,047 --> 01:28:55,039
I never lied.
Except when necessary.

1232
01:28:55,078 --> 01:28:58,013
I have always brought my parents expensive gifts.

1233
01:28:58,030 --> 01:29:00,005
It was with there credit card of course, but.

1234
01:29:00,021 --> 01:29:04,023
I dont deserve this humiliation.
You need to get out there.

1235
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:08,047
Miss Hoffenfeffer and her sock puppet are
stinking up the premises.

1236
01:29:10,002 --> 01:29:16,005
Now the only thing that would make this any lovelier
would be if i won that Star Dazzle award, Sharpay.

1237
01:29:16,025 --> 01:29:20,087
I am going to find you,
that award it tell you it is mine, mine.

1238
01:29:21,097 --> 01:29:24,050
Mirror, mirror on the wall, whos the....

1239
01:29:25,049 --> 01:29:26,054
Oh forget it.

1240
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:30,045
How is the show going?

1241
01:29:32,022 --> 01:29:33,048
hows it going?

1242
01:29:34,024 --> 01:29:37,071
This show makes the captain of the Titanic
look like he won the lottery.

1243
01:29:38,019 --> 01:29:41,059
I will sing with you, Sharpay.
What?

1244
01:29:41,076 --> 01:29:44,085
I promised.
And i keep my promises.

1245
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,034
But what was the first thing you said to me
when i first started working here?

1246
01:29:50,059 --> 01:29:52,030
Bring me more ice tea?

1247
01:29:52,062 --> 01:29:55,004
Think harder. we are....

1248
01:29:56,095 --> 01:29:59,097
all in this together.
Exactly.

1249
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,065
Well, we are.

1250
01:30:04,046 --> 01:30:08,060
Lets get out there and knock them 
dead Troy Bolton. I do the show,

1251
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,043
If the Wildcats do the show.

1252
01:30:15,008 --> 01:30:16,057
I would think fast.

1253
01:30:17,054 --> 01:30:20,004
I just sort of wish you were doing this for me.

1254
01:30:22,041 --> 01:30:24,041
Your a good guy, Troy.

1255
01:30:26,062 --> 01:30:30,069
Actually... right now i think i like 
you better than i like myself.

1256
01:30:31,063 --> 01:30:33,023
Did i just say that?

1257
01:30:38,045 --> 01:30:40,087
Girls! Places.

1258
01:31:00,097 --> 01:31:03,073
Ok, Everyone, Ryan the show is on.

1259
01:31:03,093 --> 01:31:05,043
Where is the music?
Where is Troy?

1260
01:31:05,056 --> 01:31:08,034
Talked to Sharpay, and everything is cool.
Speaking of my sister....

1261
01:31:08,051 --> 01:31:11,020
.... she wants you to learn a new song.

1262
01:31:11,062 --> 01:31:12,081
Everyday.

1263
01:31:13,028 --> 01:31:14,071
I cant learn a new song.

1264
01:31:14,086 --> 01:31:16,042
Kelsi will help you with it.
What?

1265
01:31:17,073 --> 01:31:18,087
Its Showtime!

1266
01:31:20,056 --> 01:31:24,049
What team?  WILCATS!
What team? WILDCATS!

1267
01:31:39,070 --> 01:31:44,072
Now it is time for our five time 
Star Dazzle Award winner.

1268
01:31:44,099 --> 01:31:49,030
Sharpay Evans, singing this year 
with our assistant golf pro,

1269
01:31:49,088 --> 01:31:51,066
Mr Troy Bolton.

1270
01:31:54,018 --> 01:31:55,012
Where is Troy?

1271
01:31:56,089 --> 01:32:00,016
Why did you switch songs?
Switch songs? What?

1272
01:32:00,033 --> 01:32:01,044
Ryan said....

1273
01:32:02,022 --> 01:32:04,042
Bolton.
But....

1274
01:32:04,057 --> 01:32:06,026
I didnt learn a new song.

1275
01:32:06,095 --> 01:32:07,093
Exactly.

1276
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:14,018
Girls!

1277
01:32:24,067 --> 01:32:32,064
Once in a lifetime
means there's no second chance

1278
01:32:32,088 --> 01:32:41,002
so I believe than you and me
should grab it while we can

1279
01:32:41,027 --> 01:32:49,045
Make it last forever
and never give it back

1280
01:32:49,068 --> 01:32:55,075
It’s our turn, and I’m lovin' where we’re at

1281
01:32:57,099 --> 01:33:05,007

01:33:48,023 --> 01:33:55,072
They say that you should follow
and chase down what you dream,

1290
01:33:55,097 --> 01:34:00,001
but if you get lost and lose yourself

1291
01:34:00,028 --> 01:34:04,030
what does is really mean?

1292
01:34:04,049 --> 01:34:08,078
No matter where we’re going,

1293
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,092
it starts from where we are.

1294
01:34:13,016 --> 01:34:20,047
There’s more to life when we listen to our hearts

1295

If you will all take your seats.

1324
01:37:12,004 --> 01:37:14,070
There is one last task that i have to 
perform this evening.

1325
01:37:15,036 --> 01:37:19,079
The Star Dazzle for this year 
goes to of course....

1326
01:37:19,097 --> 01:37:21,033
our one and only....

1327
01:37:22,001 --> 01:37:24,023
My brother, Ryan Evans.

1328
01:37:34,073 --> 01:37:35,059
That’s our boy.

1329
01:37:38,014 --> 01:37:39,015
Nice hat.

1330
01:37:50,071 --> 01:37:53,084
You are the music in me

1331
01:37:56,014 --> 01:37:59,051
You know the words
"Once Upon A Time"

1332
01:37:59,071 --> 01:38:04,090
Make you listen?
There's a reason

1333
01:38:05,049 --> 01:38:08,094
When you dream there's a 
chance you'll find

1334
01:38:09,019 --> 01:38:14,010
A little laughter or happy ever after

1335
01:38:14,034 --> 01:38:18,085
yeah harmony to the melody

1336
01:38:19,007 --> 01:38:23,033
It's echoing inside my head

1337
01:38:23,067 --> 01:38:26,058
Here is to the future!

1338
01:38:27,012 --> 01:38:27,091
No

1339
01:38:28,075 --> 01:38:30,028
This is to right now.

1340
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,046
pulling me

1341
01:38:33,098 --> 01:38:39,066
When I hear my favorite song
I know that we belong

1342
01:38:39,092 --> 01:38:45,086
Oh, you are the music in me
Yeah it's living in all of us

1343
01:38:46,011 --> 01:38:52,044
And it's brought us here because
