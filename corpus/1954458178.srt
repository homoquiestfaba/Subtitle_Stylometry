2
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:58,957
Yeah well this is what the
problem is right here.

3
00:01:02,895 --> 00:01:04,563
What are you doing here?

4
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:08,900
Yikes.

5
00:01:13,372 --> 00:01:14,739
Hello?

6
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:16,241
Hey girl.

7
00:01:18,043 --> 00:01:20,812
No I'm supposed to be on my way back.
I told you I had something else to do.

8
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:23,315
Yeah I'm out here dealing with
this pipe.

9
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,085
You're going to deal with the pipe.

10
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:29,721
Why don't you cook a little
something up and, uh, you know...

11
00:01:29,788 --> 00:01:31,456
I'll bring some champagne.

12
00:01:32,558 --> 00:01:33,492
Yeah.

13
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:34,659
Alright.

14
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:36,595
See you when I see ya.

15
00:01:39,665 --> 00:01:42,734
Yeah you're luck
she's in a good mood.

16
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:31,516
Good morning all you lovely Michiganders!
It's a great day to be Up North.

17
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:36,488
Highs in the upper 70s/low 80s today and
all week, and not a drop of rain in sight.

18
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,856
I can't think of a better way to
kick off the summer,

19
00:02:38,924 --> 00:02:42,661
and celebrate all of that ice
finally melting in Lake Michigan,

20
00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:46,665
than to grab your bathing suit and
your suntan lotion and hit the beach.

21
00:02:46,865 --> 00:02:50,468
You know, they say in Michigan you're
never more than six miles from a lake,

22
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:52,437
so no excuses on not getting out
there.

23
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:57,409
Winter is finally over, school's out, and
the trees have all of their leaves again.

24
00:02:57,476 --> 00:03:00,011
It's time to frolic the sun
while we still have it!

25
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,915
So break out the barbecue, air out
the cabin, and enjoy all that summer in

26
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:09,487
Michigan has to offer, because in six months
will all be up to our necks again in snow.

27
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:13,391
But for now, life is good in the
Great Lakes State!

28
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:51,129
Hey, where's everyone?

29
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:53,565
The gas isn't working yet.

30
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,734
I've been trying to make you
eggs for the last 10 minutes.

31
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:57,769
Should be working. I had hot
water.

32
00:03:57,836 --> 00:04:01,539
I'll call John from the rental office. In
the mean time, this is all you get. Sorry.

33
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,741
I'll take it.

34
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,576
So where are the kids?

35
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,746
Hold that thought.

36
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:10,848
This is Michael.

37
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:13,885
What's that?

38
00:04:15,187 --> 00:04:17,522
No no no, I can't hear you at
all.

39
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,923
- Nicole?
- Say it again?

40
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:21,559
- Yeah?
- Can you come here, please?

41
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:24,962
What?

42
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:26,598
Are you going somewhere?

43
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,533
I'm going to the beach with
Alex.

44
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:32,103
No no, slow down. I got all that. What I
didn't get was the part about the turbines?

45
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,672
What's happening?

46
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:35,139
What? Nicole wait!

47
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:36,040
What's going on with
them?

48
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:37,909
Is the water at the beach ok?

49
00:04:37,976 --> 00:04:38,976
Hold on a second Will...

50
00:04:39,044 --> 00:04:41,546
It's fine. Lampreys don't attack
people.

51
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:44,482
Unless you act like a fish.

52
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:46,851
I'm kidding.

53
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:49,487
Alright, cool story dad. Can I
go now?

54
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:54,158
Yes. Just uh, keep your phone on ok?
'Cause Kyle may be meeting with you later.

55
00:04:54,226 --> 00:04:55,993
- Alright bye!
- Alright.

56
00:04:56,061 --> 00:04:57,395
Yeah that's fine. Get your
office together. Meet me

57
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,432
by the turbines and we'll see
what's jamming it up.

58
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,767
10 minutes is perfect. Ok.

59
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,537
Turbines are down at the Dam.

60
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:07,972
So what does that have to do
with you?

61
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:09,874
Don't know yet.

62
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:12,544
Who's Alex?

63
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:15,714
Some boy that she met.

64
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:18,883
We're here a day, and she's
already met a boy?

65
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:22,954
That's what happens when you take
a teenager away from her friends.

66
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:25,523
So I've heard.

67
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:27,225
What ever happened to Joe?

68
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:31,896
She broke up with Joel 2 months
ago.

69
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:35,166
Dad! Dad! Look what I caught!

70
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:37,235
That's great buddy.

71
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:38,636
Hey!

72
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,039
Look, it's a big ole trout!

73
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:43,174
And check it out!

74
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,709
Michael!

75
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,944
It's got a Lamprey!

76
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:50,849
Son of a gun. Look at that.

77
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,158
See, look all those other
Lamprey marks.

78
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:03,628
Just like you said Dad. Isn't it
cool?

79
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,962
Yeah.

80
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,099
Yeah cool. Can you just
take it outside, please?

81
00:06:17,075 --> 00:06:19,176
Just not our lucky day.

82
00:06:20,178 --> 00:06:22,013
I know you're hungry boy.

83
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,649
I'm hungry too.

84
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,118
There ain't no fish in this
water.

85
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:09,293
Right now. You see how hard they
are to come off?

86
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:10,829
Right?

87
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:12,831
That's why you always want to
handle them, right back here.

88
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:14,031
Behind the head.

89
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:15,900
Just to be safe.

90
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:19,270
Dad, Can I come to work with
you?

91
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:21,639
I'll tell you what, how about
tomorrow?

92
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:22,273
Ok.

93
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,942
Alright, cool.

94
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:28,079
- Cool.
- Look at that, huh?

95
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:33,885
No.

96
00:07:36,054 --> 00:07:37,121
Hey.

97
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:38,055
You want to keep'em?

98
00:07:38,123 --> 00:07:39,223
Ok?

99
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,359
Alright, look, We gotta get him
in a tank.

100
00:07:41,426 --> 00:07:43,294
There's one in the back of my
truck.

101
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:46,063
Keep the lid on it at all times. Otherwise
it will climb up the side and get out.

102
00:07:47,132 --> 00:07:49,834
Nice pet Michael. It looks like
an anus with teeth.

103
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,369
Come on.

104
00:07:51,436 --> 00:07:52,971
Hey hey hey!

105
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:55,840
Hello.

106
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,376
Hi. Oh my god.

107
00:07:58,443 --> 00:07:59,210
Yeah.

108
00:07:59,277 --> 00:08:00,712
Those eels?

109
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:02,514
Oh actually they're not eels.
These are Lampreys. They're uh-

110
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:07,184
Oh what are you? Are you a Fish and
Wildlife service? Oh my, look at you.

111
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:09,120
So you know all about that
stuff.

112
00:08:09,187 --> 00:08:10,722
Little bit, yeah.

113
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:12,390
- Totally do.
- Yeah.

114
00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:16,327
I'm Ellen, I live just like
right there.

115
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:17,461
Right.

116
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,364
- Hi. Hi I'm Cate.
- Hi.

117
00:08:20,432 --> 00:08:21,666
Cookies.

118
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,335
Thanks and this is my
husband, Michael.

119
00:08:24,803 --> 00:08:27,405
- I just though I would just say hi and- 
- That's nice of you.

120
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:29,407
You know, welcome you guys to
the neighborhood.

121
00:08:29,474 --> 00:08:31,976
- That's very sweet of you. Thank you.
- So sweet.

122
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:35,479
So I also wanted to just tell
you to be very careful.

123
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:39,183
Because Ted Jorgensen went
missing last week.

124
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:41,819
And like no one can find him,
and everyone thinks is like a,

125
00:08:41,887 --> 00:08:44,255
like a wolf, like attacked
him or something.

126
00:08:44,322 --> 00:08:46,791
We will probably be fine, right
Michael?

127
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,426
Well, I mean you can never be
too careful.

128
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:50,394
Sure. That's right.
True. Yeah.

129
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:54,165
You know we are totally good.
We're just here for the summer.

130
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:57,368
You guys are welcome to enjoy my
pool.

131
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:01,105
Anytime, just feel free
to help yourself.

132
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,840
Thanks.

133
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:04,976
Oh my god yes! I have new
neighbors.

134
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,211
Yes, it is exciting. Thank you.

135
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,780
Enjoy the cookies.

136
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:11,783
Have a good day. Thanks for
stopping by. That was sweet of you.

137
00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:15,053
Can you believe that?

138
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,356
Yeah well I told you I was a, catch.

139
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:21,459
Right.

140
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:25,196
Uh ok yes. So, you're probably gonna have to
bring home dinner, cause the gas isn't working.

141
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:27,131
Will sushi do?

142
00:09:27,332 --> 00:09:28,800
No.

143
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,035
- I'll see you later.
- Alright. Bye.

144
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:50,822
There, here, and over here. The whole
structure is breaking down and, and it leaks.

145
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:54,191
Now the dam is good for 10
years. 20 maybe.

146
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:56,961
You know, the biggest issue is
with these turbines.

147
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:01,198
Not the Lamprey population. Once we
get these cleared out and moving again,

148
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:06,104
the Lampreys won't be able to slip through.
And then, I'm sorry to say Mr. Parker,

149
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:08,372
you'll have made this trip for
nothing.

150
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,507
Let's hope so.

151
00:10:09,574 --> 00:10:12,076
The turbines aren't the issue,
Marcy.

152
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:15,379
The Lamprey population in this
river is way above normal.

153
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:19,450
That's why I invited Mr. Parker
here, because he's an expert.

154
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:25,123
Well, I think you're making a big
deal about nothing. They're just fish.

155
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:28,793
Damn those things are ugly.

156
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:32,329
Yeah, you're right Rich. They do
kinda look like YOU!

157
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:36,300
No no no no.

158
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:37,601
Don't do that.

159
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,502
What?

160
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,038
I need to examine them first.

161
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:43,374
A dead Lamprey is a good
Lamprey. Where is he?

162
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:45,176
Guys!

163
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:48,412
Please. Just low a little respect
for Mr. Parker. He is the expert, huh.

164
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,347
Look, there shouldn't be this
many getting through.

165
00:10:50,415 --> 00:10:51,816
Are there barriers set up?

166
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,886
Yeah, the velocity barriers,
just like you guys told us.

167
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:56,287
And they're still getting in,
huh?

168
00:10:56,354 --> 00:10:58,990
Yeah. Well, I guess so.

169
00:10:59,624 --> 00:11:01,025
Well, that's an issue that we're
gonna have to address.

170
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,628
Excuse me, Mr. expert, dude
that knows more then us...

171
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,364
We're done for today, right?

172
00:11:07,432 --> 00:11:08,900
I'm sorry, Mitch, is it?

173
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:10,367
- No it's rich.
- It's Rich.

174
00:11:10,435 --> 00:11:13,470
Rich. Well if it's ok with you,
I'd still like to take a count,

175
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:17,374
And please, don't throw anymore
dead ones in the water, ok?

176
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:21,012
I say, dumb the whole TFM on
them, and be done with them.

177
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,246
Nuke the lake.

178
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:25,183
I like the smell of lampricide
in the morning.

179
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:29,284
<i>www.hounddawgs.org</i>

180
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:30,654
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,156
This guy for real?

182
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:33,825
Yes.

183
00:11:33,892 --> 00:11:36,493
The lampricide was good
enough when I used it last summer.

184
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:40,664
Rich. I'm sure you're joking and
all that, but just so you know

185
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,467
the lampricide doesn't work on
the adults.

186
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:44,702
Only on the eggs.

187
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,139
No no, it's worked. Its-Its
always worked.

188
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:52,476
Well, she's as clear as she's
gonna get.

189
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:56,447
Ok.

190
00:11:56,514 --> 00:11:59,083
Get out of the water. Throw the
switch.

191
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:01,352
See if it works.

192
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:15,032
Yes!

193
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,433
Good Job.

194
00:12:23,508 --> 00:12:25,209
There doesn't appear to be too
many so far.

195
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,945
But it doesn't hurt to be safe
just in case the lake gets infested.

196
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,648
Especially if the turbine
problems continue.

197
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:32,583
Do you think it'll work?

198
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:35,186
What the hell is that?

199
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,321
A stunboat.

200
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:42,193
Used in a large direct-current barrier to keep
the population under control and reduce it.

201
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,396
Zap'em. Like'em.
NOT!

202
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:47,965
Rich. Out.

203
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:06,050
We use the stunboat for the
initial culling, alright?

204
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,319
And then we'll keep future
generations away from the dam

205
00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:10,688
by building a barrier
directly in the stream bed.

206
00:13:10,755 --> 00:13:14,458
You'll only need it during mating season,
and it'll be low enough that it won't

207
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:17,394
affect the other species. But we can't
have anymore Lamprey's entering the dam.

208
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:20,131
Ok I'm not sure if a stunboat,
even a powerful one, is going to

209
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,034
be able to take out the entire
adult Lamprey populations.

210
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:26,570
- I hear yeah.
- We need to look for a wider reaching solution.

211
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:28,505
Sounds like job security.

212
00:13:29,674 --> 00:13:32,409
And that sounds like job
insecurity...

213
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:35,046
Morning, people!

214
00:13:36,614 --> 00:13:43,120
Nothing better in the world then
sunrise on Lake Charlevoix.

215
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:48,559
It's like an angel kissed this
little drip of water.

216
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:49,593
Good morning, Mayor.

217
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:51,329
Hey.

218
00:13:51,663 --> 00:13:55,266
You must be the guy they sent
from Fish and Wildlife.

219
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,433
I'm Michael Parker, sir.

220
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:59,136
- Ah, Bruce Akerman-
- Nice to met you.

221
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:02,340
...but just call me, Mayor.

222
00:14:02,407 --> 00:14:03,975
Ok.

223
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:07,745
- I only have 3 years more to hear that title.
- Ok.

224
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:11,715
So, get me up to speed.

225
00:14:11,783 --> 00:14:13,384
The turbines are working.

226
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:17,454
That's great Rich, but it doesn't
help with the fish problem.

227
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:19,423
Actually it does, Mayor.

228
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:23,127
Um, we need the turbines working to keep the
population of Lamprey's under control here,

229
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,364
and to the connecting waterways
to Lake Michigan.

230
00:14:26,431 --> 00:14:28,132
That ain't gonna happen.

231
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,669
This is the best fishing in the
world. Right here on Lake Charlevoix.

232
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:34,305
Ain't that right, Will?

233
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,073
Yes, sir. The best.

234
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:39,210
Happen you hear anything about Ted?

235
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,113
No...No.

236
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:43,714
So, what do you think?

237
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:46,150
Two days at the most?

238
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,652
Well, It's-It's hard to say
at this point...

239
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,092
Look. I know this is a big
government job...

240
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,228
But I have a town to run...

241
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:00,631
that loves its summers.

242
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,201
I can't afford any tourists.

243
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,804
This is a small town.

244
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:08,239
We need all the revenue we can
get.

245
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:11,309
I understand that Mayor.
All I am saying is that, 2 days -

246
00:15:11,376 --> 00:15:15,246
- might not be enough time to
cull the entire population.

247
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,448
I'll tell you what...

248
00:15:17,515 --> 00:15:20,584
You get this done, in 2 days...

249
00:15:20,652 --> 00:15:22,386
Scratch that...

250
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:29,860
One day, and I'll treat you and your
family to a fabulous steak dinner at Cobbs.

251
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:31,895
You'll love it!

252
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,265
Thick, Juicy...

253
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,269
You're not a vegetarian, are
you?

254
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,870
I don't want to offend your...

255
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:43,240
Western sensibilities...

256
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:46,277
No I'm not a vegetarian, But the
important issue here...

257
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:49,080
- I have a town to run!
- OK... great chatting with you.

258
00:15:50,882 --> 00:15:53,717
Do you really think the lampreys
can get into Lake Michigan?

259
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:57,188
It's possible if we don't get
this population under control.

260
00:15:57,255 --> 00:16:01,525
But that's 20,000 square miles!
That-That's insane, Will.

261
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:06,864
Yeah. Look, let's get back to base.
We'll talk about this after lunch.

262
00:16:06,931 --> 00:16:08,399
Let's go.

263
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:47,905
- Ready?
- Yeah.

264
00:16:47,972 --> 00:16:49,540
You're holding it wrong.

265
00:16:49,607 --> 00:16:51,509
I'm like the queen of selfies.

266
00:16:51,576 --> 00:16:53,810
Here you're majesty. Let me do
it.

267
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,815
That's cold. That's cold.

268
00:16:58,883 --> 00:17:02,153
- You're such a jerk!
- Hey hey! That's freezing.

269
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,221
Oh good. It turn out cute
though.

270
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,532
Nicole!

271
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,601
Hey Nicole!

272
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:21,439
Hey Nicole!

273
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:47,465
Are you lost, boy?
Or just hungry?

274
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:55,606
What's your name, boy?

275
00:17:57,775 --> 00:17:59,477
Look at you, scootin' your butt.

276
00:17:59,544 --> 00:18:01,712
I'm gonna call you, Scooter.

277
00:18:01,913 --> 00:18:03,414
Come on boy!

278
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:10,821
Hey Scooter!

279
00:18:19,397 --> 00:18:20,864
Is that your little brother?

280
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,267
Oh yeah.

281
00:18:24,035 --> 00:18:25,236
Scooter!

282
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:28,539
Scooter!

283
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:33,744
He looks happy.

284
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:34,978
Yeah...

285
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,880
He's kind of a weird kid.

286
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:39,683
- Really?
- Not like in a bad way or anything, but...

287
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:41,552
He's just always by himself.

288
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:46,490
He really looks up to my dad and stuff,
but my dad's like always gone. So...

289
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:48,759
Doesn't he have any friends?

290
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:51,629
- No?
- No.

291
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,730
We just moved here.

292
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,033
Scooter!

293
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,836
I'll be his friend.

294
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:00,837
Really?

295
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:02,339
Heck yeah.

296
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,974
I need a new fishing buddy.

297
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,576
That's really sweet of you.

298
00:19:11,015 --> 00:19:12,383
Scooter?

299
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,818
Scooter! Come here boy!

300
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,622
Scooter!

301
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,391
Kyle, you're ok?

302
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,793
I can't find my stupid glasses.

303
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,429
Hey don't worry little dude.
I'll find them.

304
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:29,667
The dog I was playing with,
Scooter. I can't find him. He's hurt.

305
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:30,801
Ok.

306
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:32,803
Come on. We'll find him.

307
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:34,371
You're hurt.

308
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,441
Oh my god!

309
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,742
You're all bloody!

310
00:19:38,943 --> 00:19:40,544
That is not my blood.

311
00:19:40,745 --> 00:19:42,746
Oh my god!

312
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,848
It's fish guts.

313
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:48,619
Alex!

314
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,920
Get out of the water!

315
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:04,801
- You found my glasses!
- Yeah!

316
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:05,802
What about Scooter?

317
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,538
No luck. Are you ok?

318
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:12,175
Yeah. Yeah it's just fish guts.

319
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,645
Barf. Barf. Ok Come on. Come on.

320
00:20:25,022 --> 00:20:26,189
Well,...

321
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,125
...my gut is that without any
natural enemies,

322
00:20:28,192 --> 00:20:31,629
the Lampreys can get out of control.
But, there is a dam that separates Lake

323
00:20:31,696 --> 00:20:35,466
Charlevoix from the rivers. I think
we can contain them pretty easily.

324
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:38,535
Well, that's a bit of good news.
But Lamprey's jump.

325
00:20:38,603 --> 00:20:40,170
Yeah, but not that high.

326
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:42,105
How high is the wall?

327
00:20:42,173 --> 00:20:45,142
You know, it's different in
different places.

328
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:49,179
Well, make sure that the water
levels are down by about 10 feet.

329
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:50,947
Lampreys can't jump that high.

330
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:55,519
Really? I have a hickey on the
back of my neck that says otherwise.

331
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,488
They attack people?

332
00:20:57,555 --> 00:21:00,758
Certain species can be very aggressive.
If they run out of food in their area,

333
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:04,060
they're going to look for blood
anyway they can.

334
00:21:04,562 --> 00:21:06,730
It's interesting. Ok?
Thanks.

335
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,065
Sure. Just don't let them get
any further.

336
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:11,702
Yeah will do. I'll talk to you
later.

337
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:24,682
Hi Nicki!

338
00:21:24,749 --> 00:21:27,150
Dad! The craziest thing
just happened at the beach!

339
00:21:27,218 --> 00:21:29,653
There was fish blood all over my
legs, Dad!

340
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:30,587
What's that?

341
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:32,289
It was so gross.

342
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:35,759
There were dead fish and
those Lamprey things in the water.

343
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,260
Alright, how many of them were
there?

344
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,563
I don't know. Like-like a lot.

345
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,765
Sweetie I'm sorry
you had to go through that.

346
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:45,001
Alright, we'll check
it out for you.

347
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:48,004
Dad, can you come home?

348
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:51,809
Awe, sweetheart I can't right
now.

349
00:21:51,876 --> 00:21:56,179
Look I know it was scary for
you, but they only go after fish, ok?

350
00:21:56,247 --> 00:21:59,249
They won't attack people unless
they're starving.

351
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:00,917
But, Dad...

352
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:04,921
Sweetie... I-I-I gotta go right
now. I'll be home later tonight.

353
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:06,122
Ok.

354
00:22:07,425 --> 00:22:10,627
No-no. You're gonna be fine.
Trust me, ok? Bye.

355
00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:13,964
Hello?

356
00:22:19,704 --> 00:22:21,104
Thank you, sir.

357
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:24,708
That was Mayor Akerman.

358
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,845
He said that people have been
reporting a school of fish-

359
00:22:27,912 --> 00:22:30,947
Washed up a shore dead. Yeah, my
daughter just told me.

360
00:22:31,148 --> 00:22:34,551
Covered in bloody lesions.
That's...gotta be the Lamprey's, right?

361
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:37,621
Well, I would assume so. But how
many Lampreys can be in the Lake?

362
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,322
I don't know. I figured it was
just a handful.

363
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:42,259
I thought our problem was with
the river infestation.

364
00:22:42,326 --> 00:22:44,628
Well either way, we're gonna have
to check out how they're slipping

365
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,130
through the barriers
and the turbines.

366
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:49,232
Rich will take care of it.

367
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:51,067
- Rich!
- On it!

368
00:22:51,736 --> 00:22:52,936
Hey baby.

369
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:55,305
Wanna go for a ride?

370
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:56,707
No.

371
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,208
Frigid.

372
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,144
I should probably go with him.

373
00:23:01,212 --> 00:23:02,345
I want to see if the Lamprey
numbers are increasing.

374
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:05,416
Don't worry about it. He'll
report back.

375
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:08,886
Alright, he'll handle that. You and I have
to see how they're slipping through. Come on.

376
00:23:08,953 --> 00:23:10,421
Ok.

377
00:23:10,488 --> 00:23:13,056
Do you need me to go with
you? I mean, go with you guys?

378
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:15,893
No we're good. Thank you, Marcy.

379
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,561
Ok.

380
00:23:18,362 --> 00:23:19,730
Frigid.

381
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:28,705
Mr. Expert, telling me what
to do. Making me sit on a boat.

382
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:38,715
Yep. They're getting through
alright.

383
00:23:38,783 --> 00:23:41,251
Operation rescue. Completed.

384
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,719
Check.

385
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:47,925
Operation cold one, is a go.

386
00:23:53,731 --> 00:23:55,632
Man!

387
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:23,994
Where all the fish?

388
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,363
The Lampreys must have gotten
them all.

389
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:31,167
Oh my god.

390
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,639
I've never seen that before.

391
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,842
There's nothing left for them to
eat.

392
00:24:39,143 --> 00:24:41,778
They destroyed the entire eco
system.

393
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,180
Or scared it away.

394
00:24:50,254 --> 00:24:51,788
They're coming right through.

395
00:24:51,856 --> 00:24:53,056
I don't get it.

396
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:55,826
They're using their mouths like
suction cups to move the rocks.

397
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:58,261
I've only ever seen them do that
when they build nests.

398
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:01,231
That is desperate for food.

399
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,003
A desperate Lamprey is a
dangerous Lamprey.

400
00:25:06,203 --> 00:25:08,972
I think they are doing the
exact same thing over there.

401
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:13,276
At this rate, they are going to
tear a hole in the dam.

402
00:25:13,344 --> 00:25:15,378
We're going to have to rethink
our plan.

403
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:19,983
That's Rich's boat.

404
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,786
Yeah, Where's Rich?

405
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:30,160
Hey...Hello? Hello? Got you.
Leave a message, this is Rich...

406
00:25:30,227 --> 00:25:32,262
Call's not going through.

407
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:38,835
My sister dates a guy that works at
sanitation. That disappeared about a week ago.

408
00:25:39,203 --> 00:25:41,872
Yeah I heard about this, uh...

409
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:44,041
Ted...something, right?

410
00:25:44,108 --> 00:25:47,477
Jorgenson. Yeah. At first everybody thought
he went to town to blow off some steam,

411
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:51,347
but my sister insisted something
bad happened to him.

412
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:52,816
Like what?

413
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,417
I don't know.

414
00:25:54,485 --> 00:25:56,519
...but they found his truck.

415
00:25:56,588 --> 00:26:00,123
And they didn't find him.

416
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:02,292
Alright, let get Rich's
boat.

417
00:26:09,533 --> 00:26:12,368
Is that blood?
Quick, grab the corner.

418
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,375
Don't grab it! Don't grab it!

419
00:26:23,247 --> 00:26:25,015
Don't pull! Don't pull!

420
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,317
Damn this thing is strong!

421
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:28,952
Hold on!

422
00:26:31,288 --> 00:26:33,056
Hold still. Hold still.

423
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:43,133
Son of a bitch!

424
00:26:45,202 --> 00:26:47,004
This is Will?

425
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:53,744
They found Rich.

426
00:26:54,545 --> 00:26:56,379
They found his body.

427
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,336
Oh Rich.

428
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:25,142
What did they do to your face?

429
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:15,625
Hello?

430
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:18,361
Yeah hi, is this the Coroner's
office?

431
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:20,430
Yes, this is Jim.

432
00:28:20,497 --> 00:28:24,935
Hi, this is Michael Parker from Fish and
Wildlife. You guys got a body in there earlier with

433
00:28:25,002 --> 00:28:29,206
marks all over it. I need you no to
do anything with it until we get there.

434
00:28:32,643 --> 00:28:33,576
Hello?

435
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:38,281
Hello?

436
00:28:51,295 --> 00:28:52,996
Hello?

437
00:29:00,704 --> 00:29:04,407
Yes, I have an emergency down at
the Coroner's office.

438
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:11,114
Rich, what a way to
go.

439
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,387
Poor guy.

440
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,424
Right this way, Mayor.
Michael's waiting inside with the body.

441
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,895
What the heck?

442
00:29:28,732 --> 00:29:31,101
Oh my god, Jim.

443
00:29:33,704 --> 00:29:36,239
What the hell is all over him?

444
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:37,640
Lesions.

445
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:38,675
From what?

446
00:29:38,742 --> 00:29:40,143
Lampreys.

447
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,012
That's impossible.

448
00:29:42,246 --> 00:29:45,248
There's too many of them.
They're all over his body.

449
00:29:45,716 --> 00:29:47,684
How did they get in here?

450
00:29:47,751 --> 00:29:49,619
Rich was dead when he came in.

451
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:53,990
So they were just feeding off of
him from the inside?

452
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,359
Yeah.

453
00:29:58,395 --> 00:30:00,063
Mayor, we have to close the
Lake, Now!

454
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,466
And that's just the start. We have
a much bigger issue at hand here.

455
00:30:03,534 --> 00:30:04,835
Bigger?

456
00:30:04,902 --> 00:30:07,670
I think the Lamprey that killed
him and the Coroner...

457
00:30:07,738 --> 00:30:10,040
crawled off and into the drain.

458
00:30:10,107 --> 00:30:11,341
Into the pipes!

459
00:30:11,408 --> 00:30:14,644
Yeah. You need to shut the water
system down, Now!

460
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:16,179
Shut down the...

461
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,580
What?!

462
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:22,018
No. Even the
residents will leave.

463
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:23,786
Look, I know I'm asking a lot
Mayor but-

464
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,756
You want to shut down the water
system?

465
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:30,793
because of a bunch of baby eels,
that will be dead in 2 hours?

466
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:38,168
Lampreys live for over 14 years. They lay
approximately 100,000 eggs at a time. Each.

467
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:42,305
You do not want these creatures in
your pipes! Not even one of them!

468
00:30:44,308 --> 00:30:49,212
Let's go to my office, where we
can discuss our options...

469
00:30:50,314 --> 00:30:52,349
...in friendlier confines.

470
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:57,120
Fine.

471
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,338
How did so many get out
anyway?

472
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:19,709
I though you said you could
contain this in just a day?

473
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:23,646
No no, YOU said a day. I said I
needed more time.

474
00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:26,516
Now I need to do an accurate count of
the Lamprey. Otherwise we won't be able

475
00:31:26,583 --> 00:31:29,819
to contain the problem. It's gonna
take a few days. May be a week.

476
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:31,587
I can't do a week.

477
00:31:31,655 --> 00:31:33,390
I need the time to do a survey
of the Lake.

478
00:31:33,457 --> 00:31:38,461
Look, Mr. Parker, I assure you that
safety is my number one priority.

479
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:44,434
But I can't afford to lose more tourist
revenue. You're just not working fast enough!

480
00:31:44,501 --> 00:31:49,105
Those bites are just hickies.

481
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:53,143
Does that look like a hickie to
you, Sir?

482
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,477
Alright. Alright.

483
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:57,680
Just listen to me just for a
second, Mayor, ok?

484
00:31:57,748 --> 00:32:02,185
These Lampreys are stronger and more
aggressive then any other that I've ever seen.

485
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,821
The rate at which they can drain
blood is staggering!

486
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,892
What? What is so funny?

487
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:13,729
Have you ever eaten, Lampreys?

488
00:32:15,499 --> 00:32:17,100
They're not so bad.

489
00:32:17,301 --> 00:32:20,236
Chewy, like scallops.

490
00:32:20,304 --> 00:32:22,005
They love'em in Europe.

491
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:27,743
Maybe that's a direction to explore.
Turn a negative into a positive.

492
00:32:27,811 --> 00:32:29,279
These Lampreys attached us-

493
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:33,350
Nah nah nah nah. That's not
acceptable.

494
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:38,088
Let's talk...solutions.

495
00:32:38,722 --> 00:32:40,357
Go.

496
00:32:40,824 --> 00:32:43,093
Alright.

497
00:32:47,898 --> 00:32:50,467
This is us, in
Charlevoix County, ok?

498
00:32:50,534 --> 00:32:52,802
Right? This is the dam on the
Jordan River.

499
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,406
Now, they must be getting into the
pipes at the reservoir by the dam.

500
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,242
If the continue to breach the dam,
they're gonna end up in Lake Charlevoix,

501
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:03,779
From there they will be able to easily jump
over the barriers at Round Lake and Pine River...

502
00:33:03,847 --> 00:33:06,282
And then they are gonna end up
in Lake Michigan,

503
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:09,352
Which it's gonna be next to
impossible to contain them.

504
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,855
And they're gonna head over into
the canals, and onto the Mississippi.

505
00:33:12,923 --> 00:33:14,857
And we can't allow it to get to
that point.

506
00:33:14,925 --> 00:33:18,194
We have to close the river, the
Lake, and all public access to

507
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:21,464
water until we can eradicate
this problem for good.

508
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:27,770
We'll close the beaches for the weekend and
maybe the water pipes for an hour or two.

509
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:32,675
Work overtime to fix the dam and
gather up the last Lampreys from

510
00:33:32,743 --> 00:33:35,545
the Lakes and the water pipes.

511
00:33:35,612 --> 00:33:37,514
Are you insane?

512
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:40,883
Rich and the Coroner are dead! And you're
gonna tell people to stay away from the waves

513
00:33:40,951 --> 00:33:44,954
for the weekend? And close the
pipes for an hour or two?

514
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:49,659
These Lamprey are fast, they're
strong, and they're out for human blood!

515
00:33:49,726 --> 00:33:53,896
Now you need to call a press conference
and tell people to stay away from the water!

516
00:33:53,964 --> 00:33:55,965
Why haven't you tried poison?

517
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:57,300
We did! It didn't work!

518
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,636
Michael, I'm practically doing
your job for you.

519
00:34:00,704 --> 00:34:02,738
Poison only works on the
eggs.

520
00:34:02,806 --> 00:34:05,508
Well use more!

521
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:08,445
Leave now.

522
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:13,550
I'm going to work on
my...Lamprey recipes.

523
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,318
Go go go.

524
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:24,994
The Mayor's a jackass. We'll go
to press ourselves.

525
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:26,729
I'm not endangering more lives.

526
00:34:26,797 --> 00:34:29,332
Fine. But um...

527
00:34:29,766 --> 00:34:31,968
I'm gonna be heading over to
Rich's house.

528
00:34:32,035 --> 00:34:34,036
So I can offer his family my
condolences.

529
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:35,371
Ok.

530
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,310
You outta call your own family.
Let them know you love them.

531
00:34:40,377 --> 00:34:41,877
Yeah, you're probably right.

532
00:34:41,945 --> 00:34:42,845
I'll see you later.

533
00:34:47,651 --> 00:34:49,519
Yeah hi, um...

534
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:53,523
I need the number
- actually actually could you just connect me to channel 6, please.

535
00:34:53,757 --> 00:34:55,558
Yeah, I'll hold.

536
00:34:57,294 --> 00:34:59,129
<i>Lamprey infestation has
escalated beyond our</i>

537
00:34:59,196 --> 00:35:04,334
<i>initial projections. We need to evacuate
the greater Lake Charlevoix area.</i>

538
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:08,704
<i>The Lampreys we're dealing with are bigger,
stronger, and more deadly the Lampreys we've</i>

539
00:35:08,772 --> 00:35:14,777

00:35:14,845 --> 00:35:19,015

and on land with minimal moister.</i>

541
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:22,652
<i>Even you home tap. They've
contaminated water lines-</i>

542
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:26,889
Hey Michael, I'm returning your
call and listening to you on TV.

543
00:35:27,924 --> 00:35:30,660
...and you're here.

544
00:35:30,727 --> 00:35:31,694
What happened?

545
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:34,997
Long story. Where's Kyle's
Lamprey?

546
00:35:35,065 --> 00:35:36,366
I don't know.

547
00:35:36,433 --> 00:35:39,636
We have to find it. Kyle! Can
you get in here please!

548
00:35:45,075 --> 00:35:46,809
What's going on?

549
00:36:00,924 --> 00:36:03,560
<i>And the Department of Fish and
Wildlife will be working around</i>

550
00:36:03,627 --> 00:36:08,698
<i>the clock to rid the waterways of
this threat. Um, in the meantime,</i>

551
00:36:08,765 --> 00:36:14,003
<i>Please be advice that you should avoid all
fresh water sources. Including your home tap.</i>

552
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:18,107
<i>Look, these-these Lampreys are
hungry, and they're dangerous.</i>

553
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:23,613
<i>And if that means that you need to-to vacation
somewhere else for the summer, and so be it.</i>

554
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,348
Dammit!

555
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:30,753
Good Afternoon. You've reached
the department of Fish and Wildlife.

556
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,522
Yes, I'd like to speak to Josh
Friedman.

557
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,592
Hello Mayor. I'm afraid
he's not in the office right now.

558
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:38,461
Have him call me once he gets
in, Thank you.

559
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:42,798
That's-That's all I have.

560
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,611
And that man Rich, he's still
missing?

561
00:36:54,678 --> 00:36:56,078
No, he's dead.

562
00:36:56,146 --> 00:36:58,514
Mom! Dad! Where's my
Lamprey?

563
00:36:58,582 --> 00:37:00,383
Hey buddy.

564
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:04,454
Listen, you understand the second that
we find it, we have to kill it, right?

565
00:37:04,521 --> 00:37:05,921
Dad, No! I like it!

566
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:07,890
I know you do, son...but we
don't have any other choice.

567
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:09,925
Go look for it, ok?

568
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:13,663
This is getting way to
dangerous.

569
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,899
I want you all out of here tonight.
I booked you tickets already.

570
00:37:16,967 --> 00:37:18,468
Wait a second, we haven't even
talked about this.

571
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:21,638
I know Cate, I'm getting a bad f
- Found it!

572
00:37:27,077 --> 00:37:28,844
Where's the Lamprey?

573
00:37:30,814 --> 00:37:32,582
I killed it in the garbage disposal.

574
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,651
Good. Good Job.

575
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,152
Isn't leaving a little extreme?

576
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:39,155
Cate, I've never seen anything
like this before.

577
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,463
Good job buddy.

578
00:37:53,236 --> 00:37:54,737
Nicole, pack your stu-

579
00:37:55,972 --> 00:37:56,972
What's going on here?

580
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,074
Hello Mr. parker...I'm
Alex.

581
00:37:59,142 --> 00:38:01,911
Well Alex, what the hell are you
doing in my daughter's bedroom?

582
00:38:01,978 --> 00:38:03,713
Dad, stop it.

583
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,816
I told her that he can come over but she
wasn't supposed to have the door closed.

584
00:38:06,883 --> 00:38:08,551
We're not even doing anything.

585
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,553
Not yet, you don't know how guys
think.

586
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,522
- You! out! Now!
- Yes, sir.

587
00:38:12,589 --> 00:38:13,889
Alex wait.

588
00:38:13,957 --> 00:38:15,191
No no no, there's no waiting.
There's just going.

589
00:38:15,258 --> 00:38:18,027
You took away all my friends for
the entire summer.

590
00:38:18,094 --> 00:38:20,563
Excuse me for wanting a social
life!

591
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,031
Just pack your stuff. You're
leaving.

592
00:38:22,098 --> 00:38:23,833
That's not fair!

593
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:28,270
Nicole, you wanted to be back with
your friends...you got your wish, ok?

594
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,171
Well Alex and I-

595
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:31,173
Just met!

596
00:38:32,976 --> 00:38:34,143
Now I don't have time to get into this
with you, just do as I say. Please!

597
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:37,012
- You're the worst Dad!
- Yeah yeah yeah I know.

598
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,549
I freakin' hate you!

599
00:38:41,117 --> 00:38:44,687
It would have been nice if you PRETENDED
to want my input on any of this.

600
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,188
Cate, you don't understand-

601
00:38:52,929 --> 00:38:55,097
It's Will, I have to take it.

602
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:56,866
Of course you do.

603
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:58,968
Cate, come...

604
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:02,238
Come here.

605
00:39:04,174 --> 00:39:05,708
Will, talk to me.

606
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:07,009
Michael.

607
00:39:07,077 --> 00:39:08,611
There's too many.

608
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,146
They're coming through the
turbines, right over the barriers.

609
00:39:11,214 --> 00:39:13,583
Straight into Lake Charlevoix.

610
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:18,187
Alright, uh...

611
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,822
I'll be right over.

612
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,858
Please hurry.

613
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,681
There you are! Now keep
quiet and don't move.

614
00:39:45,749 --> 00:39:48,117
My parent's think I put you in
the garbage disposal.

615
00:39:49,986 --> 00:39:54,891
I know. I know. I'm sorry baby.

616
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:57,894
I'm sorry. It's gonna be ok.

617
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,898
Cate?

618
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:08,070
Look, I gotta go.

619
00:40:09,372 --> 00:40:11,641
I'm...

620
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,979
...I'll fill you in the details
later.

621
00:40:27,891 --> 00:40:29,759
You need food.

622
00:40:48,044 --> 00:40:50,346
I can't believe my stupid dad.

623
00:40:50,413 --> 00:40:52,982
He's always just trying
to control my life.

624
00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:55,384
Yeah your dad is totally
just bugging out.

625
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:57,787
I mean, it's just a few
Lampreys.

626
00:40:58,021 --> 00:41:00,389
He is totally geeking out.

627
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:02,257
I know...

628
00:41:02,325 --> 00:41:04,961
I can't believe he's making you
leave.

629
00:41:05,028 --> 00:41:07,296
You know, I'm not going!
Alright?

630
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,700
This is my life, not his.

631
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,735
He can't tell me what to do!

632
00:41:14,938 --> 00:41:17,773
Oh hey hold on Nicole I gotta take this,
but I promise I'll call you right back.

633
00:41:17,841 --> 00:41:19,241
Mr. Pools Pool cleaning?

634
00:41:19,309 --> 00:41:22,177
Hi Alex it's Ellen, how are you?

635
00:41:22,245 --> 00:41:23,646
Hey Ms. Ellen what's up?

636
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:27,383
So there is a problem in my
pool. It's kind of an emergency

637
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:31,253
and I was hoping that you
could come over and fix it.

638
00:41:31,321 --> 00:41:33,055
Sure, I'm on my way.

639
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:38,260
Ok great! Also, I'm actually not gonna
be here but I might be back later.

640
00:41:38,328 --> 00:41:39,795
Yeah, that sounds great.

641
00:41:39,863 --> 00:41:42,331
Ok. Alright. Great.

642
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:44,233
I'll talk to you soon.

643
00:41:51,374 --> 00:41:52,508
Hey Nicole.

644
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:56,078
Hey listen. Why don't I come
pick you up?

645
00:41:56,146 --> 00:42:00,082
Ms. Ellen, this lady, I clean her pool,
she's gonna be stepping out for a bit...

646
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,985
So we can have the whole place
all to ourselves for a swim.

647
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:05,287
That sounds great. I'll
meet you there.

648
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:14,096
I hope you like Cabernet, Alex.

649
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:32,114
What the heck?

650
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:42,424
Ok, the flight is for this
evening. So we have to hurry.

651
00:42:42,492 --> 00:42:43,893
Can I stay with Dad?

652
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:45,061
Absolutely not.

653
00:42:45,128 --> 00:42:47,329
But Dad promised me I could stay
with him.

654
00:42:47,397 --> 00:42:50,032
Kyle, please stop.

655
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,534
I made friends with a dog
at the Lake today.

656
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:53,803
Can I go to the beach?

657
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:56,171
What? No! The water is filled
with Lampreys.

658
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:58,140
But Dad says they're harmless.

659
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:00,876
Yeah, well now Dad says
different.

660
00:43:00,944 --> 00:43:03,112
Are you calling Dad a liar?

661
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:04,580
Really?

662
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:08,183
Please, mom? The dog is my
only friend and he needs me.

663
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:10,853
Nobody likes me.

664
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:13,122
I'm just a kid that nobody
likes.

665
00:43:13,189 --> 00:43:14,356
Get use to it.

666
00:43:14,424 --> 00:43:15,992
Oh baby.

667
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:17,860
Everybody likes you.

668
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,162
I really like you.

669
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:24,033
I love you.

670
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,134
I love you too.

671
00:43:25,201 --> 00:43:28,871
I don't think I can hear
you.

672
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:29,839
What?

673
00:43:29,906 --> 00:43:30,640
I love you.

674
00:43:30,707 --> 00:43:31,473
What?

675
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:32,341
I love you.

676
00:43:32,408 --> 00:43:34,143
One more time.

677
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:35,344
I love you too.

678
00:43:35,411 --> 00:43:36,278
I love you.

679
00:43:36,346 --> 00:43:39,248
You're so amazing.

680
00:43:41,284 --> 00:43:44,386
Yeah she's cool with it.
I come over here all the time.

681
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,589
You know, we could have just
gone to the beach.

682
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:50,192
No way. I'm not swimming in fish
pee.

683
00:43:53,363 --> 00:43:55,264
Stop.

684
00:43:55,465 --> 00:43:56,799
Come on you woos.

685
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,768
She's not here. Trust me.

686
00:43:59,102 --> 00:44:00,936
She's just...old.

687
00:44:01,004 --> 00:44:02,772
She's literally like 30.

688
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:05,474
Hello?

689
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:07,076
Ms. Ellen?

690
00:44:08,311 --> 00:44:09,545
See.

691
00:44:09,612 --> 00:44:12,848
- Nobody's here. - Ok.
- Just to ourselves.

692
00:44:17,453 --> 00:44:19,188
Ha! Who's a sissy now?

693
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,290
It's on.

694
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:40,576
Nicole, are you packed yet?

695
00:44:40,643 --> 00:44:43,112
Nicole, are you packed?

696
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,047
Nicole?

697
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,289
Kyle, have you seen your sister?

698
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,805
Oh my god.

699
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,908
Hey, it's Nicole. Don't leave a
message, just text me.

700
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:15,344
Hey Nicole, it's me. Where are
you?

701
00:45:35,531 --> 00:45:37,133
Nicole?!

702
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:08,397
Get out of there!

703
00:46:11,334 --> 00:46:13,269
Call the police! Call the
police!

704
00:46:18,608 --> 00:46:20,009
Calm down! Calm down! Calm down!

705
00:46:22,345 --> 00:46:24,613
9-1-1, what's the emergency?

706
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,027
- They're all running away.
- Yeah.

707
00:46:38,094 --> 00:46:43,665
The theory is that, the smell of their own
dead repels them. Signals something's wrong.

708
00:46:44,534 --> 00:46:46,168
Now, let's get out of here.

709
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:55,010
Now, you two work on repairing
the holes.

710
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:59,048
I'll wrangle the Lampreys to a designated
area and we can shock them there.

711
00:46:59,115 --> 00:47:02,017
Oh! Is that the Mayor?

712
00:47:04,587 --> 00:47:06,388
You! Michael!

713
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,291
Out! Now!

714
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,525
Excuse me?

715
00:47:10,593 --> 00:47:12,061
You heard me!

716
00:47:12,128 --> 00:47:13,996
Fired!

717
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:19,634
Your press conference scared off
the whole town!

718
00:47:19,702 --> 00:47:23,372
Your plans are slow, and they
don't work!

719
00:47:23,439 --> 00:47:27,142
Well I'm sorry but you can't fire
me. I report to US Fish and Wildlife.

720
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:33,082
To Josh Friedman? Ha! He agrees
with me. You're out!

721
00:47:33,149 --> 00:47:36,085
Mayor, you're making a big mistake here.
You don't understand what's at stake.

722
00:47:36,152 --> 00:47:42,091
If you don't leave now, you'll be in
breach of several trespassing laws.

723
00:47:42,158 --> 00:47:46,428
All which carry hefty fines and
jail time.

724
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:47,462
Sir, seriously-

725
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:49,631
No no no. It's ok.

726
00:47:52,735 --> 00:47:54,436
That's fine then.

727
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:56,071
Suit yourself.

728
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:58,307
Good luck Mayor. You're gonna
need it.

729
00:47:58,608 --> 00:48:00,442
Michael...wait!

730
00:48:01,677 --> 00:48:02,945
Sir, Seriously-

731
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:07,416
Will, I trust everything will be
under control soon?

732
00:48:07,483 --> 00:48:11,086
- Yes, but we have so much-
- Mayor! - Sounds good!

733
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:22,197
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

734
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:31,273
Call Cate.

735
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:33,208
Hey, you've reached Cate Parker.
I can't get to the phone

736
00:48:33,276 --> 00:48:35,344
right now. So leave a message.

737
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,812
Cate...

738
00:48:36,879 --> 00:48:38,480
You're not gonna believe this.

739
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:40,782
That son of a bitch Mayor fired
me.

740
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:43,385
I'm taking the next flight out.

741
00:48:43,586 --> 00:48:46,688
I hope you all are on the flight
already. Um...

742
00:48:46,756 --> 00:48:50,426
Look, um um sorry about before.
Call me when you land.

743
00:48:50,493 --> 00:48:52,494
I love you...

744
00:48:56,866 --> 00:48:58,267
Cate?

745
00:48:58,335 --> 00:48:59,601
Michael, it's Will.

746
00:48:59,669 --> 00:49:01,803
The Lampreys have completely
broken through the dam.

747
00:49:01,871 --> 00:49:04,139
I need your help. Please.
Can you-

748
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:05,975
Will, you heard the Mayor. I
can't do anything.

749
00:49:06,042 --> 00:49:09,644
Michael, if Lake Charlevoix gets
infested, I'll pass over to Lake Michigan.

750
00:49:09,712 --> 00:49:11,746
Then it's gonna go through every
waterway in America.

751
00:49:11,814 --> 00:49:14,416
This is a problem we have to
stop, now!

752
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:16,185
Awe, screw it.

753
00:49:16,252 --> 00:49:18,320
Alright, I'm on my way.

754
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:30,165
- Call channel 6 News...
- Channel 6 Station News?

755
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,666
Hello, this is Michael parker.

756
00:49:31,734 --> 00:49:34,236
I want to call another press
conference.

757
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:49,818
Sick! Sick!

758
00:49:51,687 --> 00:49:54,356
Someone help!

759
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:58,227
Scooter!

760
00:50:00,563 --> 00:50:01,730
Scooter!

761
00:50:01,797 --> 00:50:03,565
Where you going?

762
00:50:20,716 --> 00:50:23,785
<i>Hello, Michael Parker
from Fish and Wildlife here again.</i>

763
00:50:23,853 --> 00:50:27,856
<i>The Lamprey infestation has escalated
beyond our initial projections.</i>

764
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:30,725
<i>We need to evacuate the greater
Lake Charlevoix area.</i>

765
00:50:30,793 --> 00:50:33,728
<i>The Lampreys were dealing with
are bigger, stronger, and more</i>

766
00:50:33,796 --> 00:50:36,598
<i>deadly than the Lampreys we've
known in the past.</i>

767
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:40,001
<i>We advise you to stay away from
all fresh water sources.</i>

768
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:44,940
<i>They can maneuver through shallow depths of
water and even on land with minimal moisture.</i>

769
00:50:45,007 --> 00:50:47,309
Even your home tap.

770
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,278
<i>They have contaminated
water lines throughout</i>

771
00:50:49,345 --> 00:50:53,282
<i>the county and a deadly threat
to all life.</i>

772
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:59,388
These Lampreys...they're hungry,
determined, and dangerous.

773
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,181
We gotta get out of here, now.

774
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:29,418
We'll figure out a new game plan
when we get to somewhere safer.

775
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:35,290
There's just too many of them.

776
00:53:18,894 --> 00:53:20,061
Marcy, go check the school

777
00:53:20,129 --> 00:53:22,897
playing fields and see what
the damage is.

778
00:53:22,965 --> 00:53:24,433
Will do.

779
00:53:32,942 --> 00:53:34,876
Call Cate.

780
00:53:34,944 --> 00:53:36,378
<i>Hey, you've reached Cate Parker.</i>

781
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:38,547
<i>I can't get to the phone right
now, so leave a message.</i>

782
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:40,081
Dammit.

783
00:53:40,149 --> 00:53:42,884
Call Nicole.

784
00:53:42,952 --> 00:53:46,020
Hey it's Nicole. Don't leave a
message, just text me.

785
00:53:46,088 --> 00:53:49,758
Hey Nicole it's Dad, are you
guys on the plane?

786
00:53:49,959 --> 00:53:51,126
Call me when you land.

787
00:53:51,193 --> 00:53:53,094
Everything ok?

788
00:53:53,162 --> 00:53:58,066
Yeah yeah. It should be fine. I just got a
funny feeling. It's the second time I call.

789
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:06,174
Masses of Lampreys have been
sighted heading north to the

790
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:10,679
lake Charlevoix school playing
fields. All units please be aware.

791
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,415
Call Marcy, make sure
she's hearing this.

792
00:54:31,133 --> 00:54:32,033
Yeah?

793
00:54:32,101 --> 00:54:33,067
Are you ok?

794
00:54:33,135 --> 00:54:34,803
No I'm fine, but...

795
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,506
Can you see the Lampreys?

796
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:40,809
Yeah, and there are
hundreds of them.

797
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:43,412
Marcy, you need to get out of
there.

798
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,051
Marcy! Hang in there.

799
00:54:52,588 --> 00:54:54,690
Get out!

800
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,961
Marcy!

801
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,742
Stop! Stop! Stop!

802
00:55:18,614 --> 00:55:19,748
Will!

803
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:22,818
Marcy! get out of the car!
- Will!

804
00:55:22,885 --> 00:55:24,653
Get out of the car now!

805
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:25,620
Get out!

806
00:55:30,192 --> 00:55:31,693
Get out of the car!

807
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,516
Will...

808
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:57,151
You would have been
killed.

809
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:02,190
I'm sorry.

810
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:05,627
I'm sorry.

811
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:10,064
Look, we need to get back into
town, get a map of the water system

812
00:56:10,132 --> 00:56:13,502
and see where these things are
fanning out to so we can stop'em.

813
00:56:15,204 --> 00:56:16,705
You'll be ok?

814
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,107
I'm sorry..

815
00:56:31,153 --> 00:56:32,854
We're arriving at the
house now.

816
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:41,496
Where's the body?

817
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:45,099
Right there. There's Lampreys in
the pool.

818
00:57:00,015 --> 00:57:01,883
What is going on?

819
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:05,554
They're leaving. Everybody's getting out
of here! Kyle's all by himself! Come on!

820
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:10,625
Kyle!

821
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:13,027
- Kyle!
- Nicole wait.

822
00:57:14,897 --> 00:57:18,667
You go. I have to make sure my
family's ok.

823
00:57:23,439 --> 00:57:25,173
Be safe.

824
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:33,648
Mom?

825
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:34,916
Nicole?

826
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:36,117
Kyle? I can hear you!

827
00:57:36,185 --> 00:57:37,352
- Mom!
- Are you in the bathroom?

828
00:57:37,419 --> 00:57:42,190
I'm up here! I'm in the attic!
I'm up here!

829
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:52,000
Kyle, where are you?

830
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,648
Mom?

831
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:10,785
I'm in the bathroom,
Nicole. Stay where you are!

832
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:15,089
Where's Kyle? Is he ok?

833
00:58:16,425 --> 00:58:17,926
Mom!

834
00:58:21,497 --> 00:58:22,797
Mom!

835
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:28,336
Run!

836
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:33,642
Go! Get out of here! Go
find your brother! Please.

837
00:58:38,247 --> 00:58:39,414
Oh god no!

838
00:58:39,481 --> 00:58:41,182
Get out of here!

839
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:41,783
No!

840
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:42,784
Nicole! Go!

841
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:46,721
- No way! - Go
Nicole! - No!

842
00:58:49,324 --> 00:58:51,359
Nicole just go!

843
00:58:53,362 --> 00:58:57,265
- There's too many of them!
- Listen to me, I need you to go find your brother! Please!

844
00:58:57,332 --> 00:58:59,668
Nicole! Go!
- No way!

845
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:04,238
Here!

846
00:59:23,292 --> 00:59:24,759
Come on!

847
00:59:30,566 --> 00:59:31,365
What about Kyle?

848
00:59:31,433 --> 00:59:33,401
He wasn't in there! Where is he?

849
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:41,175
- Nicole! Are you alright?
- I'm ok! I'm ok!

850
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:49,150
Mom?

851
00:59:49,885 --> 00:59:53,888
Mom! Help! Help! Help!

852
00:59:53,956 --> 00:59:57,358
Earlier he said that he
wanted to go to the beach.

853
00:59:57,426 --> 01:00:00,261
Scooter. Scooter! It's this dumb dog
he met down there. Let's go there!

854
01:00:00,329 --> 01:00:03,131
No! You're not going alright?
You cannot go. It's too dangerous.

855
01:00:03,198 --> 01:00:05,734
There's Lampreys everywhere.

856
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:08,870
You'll be safe here. There's no
sewer or water pipes.

857
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,138
Be careful.

858
01:00:10,205 --> 01:00:11,439
I love you.

859
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:12,741
I love you.

860
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,242
I can't loose you.

861
01:00:15,477 --> 01:00:16,310
Go!

862
01:01:03,258 --> 01:01:05,827
It looks like a ghost town.

863
01:01:06,028 --> 01:01:08,997
Yeah. I guess the press
conferences worked.

864
01:01:20,275 --> 01:01:22,911
So what are we doing here?

865
01:01:22,978 --> 01:01:24,179
Well...

866
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:28,049
We need to get the Lampreys all in one place.
So we can generate a powerful enough current.

867
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:32,220
But I need the city plans to find out
where. I'm assuming Akerman has them.

868
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:34,989
I'm sure he split town by now.

869
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,193
Crap.

870
01:01:39,461 --> 01:01:41,662
- Alright, well let's just go.
- No no no no.

871
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:45,033
I always keep something
on me for the occasions.

872
01:01:45,467 --> 01:01:47,368
- Viola.
- Really?

873
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:53,608
Kyle!

874
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,544
Kyle!

875
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:05,353
Kyle.

876
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:10,391
Kyle!

877
01:02:44,426 --> 01:02:47,061
What the hell's going on?
There's blood all over the place.

878
01:02:47,129 --> 01:02:48,296
- Grab the map.
- Right.

879
01:02:48,363 --> 01:02:51,332
It should be in his desk.

880
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:57,005
- It's coming from the bathroom.
- I've got it!

881
01:02:57,072 --> 01:03:00,141
- I've got the map.
- Akerman? Akerman?

882
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:06,147
Oh my god! Close the door!

883
01:03:06,748 --> 01:03:07,882
What's the noise?

884
01:03:10,585 --> 01:03:12,420
They're breaking
through the pipes.

885
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:17,091
Will! Will! Will!

886
01:03:34,476 --> 01:03:36,444
Come on! Let's get out of here!

887
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:41,549
Get it off!

888
01:03:49,391 --> 01:03:51,459
- You ok?
- Yeah yeah. I'm good. Thanks!

889
01:03:51,526 --> 01:03:53,328
Let's get out of here.

890
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:09,543
So...

891
01:04:09,611 --> 01:04:13,147
What's... What's the plan with
the...

892
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:16,617
maps that we almost died
getting? What are we...

893
01:04:16,685 --> 01:04:23,057
We got to get to public works. Shut the water
system down. Limit their access to the town.

894
01:04:23,692 --> 01:04:25,426
It's worth a shot.

895
01:04:49,551 --> 01:04:53,587
This is the middle of dry land,
the center of the town. It's insane.

896
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,644
Come on!

897
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,760
What is it?

898
01:05:33,628 --> 01:05:35,196
I'm just...

899
01:05:36,865 --> 01:05:38,799
I just hope my family's ok.

900
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:49,210
Mom!

901
01:06:21,643 --> 01:06:24,212
Help! Mom! Help!

902
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:29,583
Help!

903
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:32,353
Help! Mom!

904
01:06:37,692 --> 01:06:38,493
Hello?

905
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,194
Nicole, sweetie are you ok?

906
01:06:40,262 --> 01:06:43,398
I'm home alone in the yard. I
don't know where mom or Kyle are.

907
01:06:43,465 --> 01:06:46,234
Alright, I'm coming home to get
you. Can you hold off till I get there?

908
01:06:46,301 --> 01:06:49,670
Yep! Dad! Please please hurry!

909
01:06:53,942 --> 01:06:55,743
Nicole!

910
01:07:05,554 --> 01:07:07,655
Dad's on his way.

911
01:07:09,891 --> 01:07:10,691
Kyle?

912
01:07:10,759 --> 01:07:12,593
I don't know where he is.

913
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:32,213
Burn them all mom. Burn them
all.

914
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,786
Help!

915
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:43,491
Help!

916
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:50,565
It's working mom. They're
leaving.

917
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:04,345
Help!

918
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:06,914
Dad!

919
01:08:06,982 --> 01:08:08,516
- I'm so glad you're ok!
- You came.

920
01:08:10,752 --> 01:08:11,919
Where's Kyle?

921
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:18,392
I don't know. I found his
bloody jacket at the beach.

922
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:21,795
No! No! Oh my god! No!

923
01:08:23,765 --> 01:08:25,966
I should've listened to you.

924
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:41,516
Guys!

925
01:08:41,583 --> 01:08:42,950
Look!

926
01:08:45,053 --> 01:08:46,820
It's Kyle!
Kyle!

927
01:08:46,888 --> 01:08:48,922
I can hear you! Hurry!

928
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:51,759
- Kyle! Wait a second Cate!
- Kyle!

929
01:08:53,795 --> 01:08:54,795
Kyle!

930
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:56,597
Cate!

931
01:08:56,898 --> 01:08:58,633
Cate! No no no you can't go in!

932
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:00,901
Cate! Wait wait!

933
01:09:02,704 --> 01:09:03,771
Listen! Listen!

934
01:09:03,838 --> 01:09:05,640
- Don't worry we'll get to him.
- Kyle!

935
01:09:05,707 --> 01:09:07,941
- If he's in the attic he's in
the safest place. He can be, ok?

936
01:09:08,009 --> 01:09:09,943
We'll get to him. We'll get to
him.

937
01:09:10,912 --> 01:09:12,547
Kyle! We're coming!

938
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:14,882
Kyle, can you hear us?

939
01:09:14,949 --> 01:09:17,418
I can hear you! Hurry!

940
01:09:17,852 --> 01:09:20,454
Dammit!

941
01:09:20,522 --> 01:09:21,689
Kyle!

942
01:09:21,756 --> 01:09:23,357
- Is there a ladder in your truck?
- No.

943
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:24,792
What about the truck itself?

944
01:09:24,859 --> 01:09:26,026
It won't be tall enough.

945
01:09:26,094 --> 01:09:28,862
Nicole, did you see a ladder in
the tool shed?

946
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:32,933
Alex! He'll be here any second.
He's got a ladder in the back of his truck.

947
01:09:33,168 --> 01:09:34,669
Kyle?

948
01:09:39,774 --> 01:09:41,576
I can't turn off the water.

949
01:09:41,643 --> 01:09:42,677
The valve is stuck.

950
01:09:53,021 --> 01:09:54,054
Your family?

951
01:09:54,122 --> 01:09:55,456
They left town already.

952
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:56,890
Why didn't you go with them?

953
01:09:56,958 --> 01:09:58,426
Thanks for coming Allen, you
have a ladder in your car?

954
01:09:58,493 --> 01:10:01,295
- Yeah, it's in the back of the truck actually.
- Ok. Good.

955
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:04,532
Dad, it's Alex.
- Alec, Alex! Go help him shut off the water. We'll get Kyle.

956
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,434
Hey hey Will! You need a hand
with that?

957
01:10:06,501 --> 01:10:08,035
Yeah Alex, do you have any
pliers?

958
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:10,638
Pliers! pliers! I got some
actually. One sec.

959
01:10:14,943 --> 01:10:15,976
Let's see man.

960
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:18,078
- Right here.
- Wait wait wait.

961
01:10:21,983 --> 01:10:23,651
Alright. Let's go.

962
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:26,420
No, I'm going. I already lost him
once. I need you to watch Nicole.

963
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:27,855
- Here.
- Alright.

964
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:30,924
Be careful, Cate.

965
01:10:30,992 --> 01:10:32,627
Kyle, I'm coming!

966
01:10:38,533 --> 01:10:41,602
Michael. Nicole. Behind you.
Lampreys.

967
01:10:41,936 --> 01:10:43,003
Nico-

968
01:10:43,071 --> 01:10:45,439
- Mom! Mom Help!
- Hang on Kyle!

969
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:48,709
- Wait wait wait.
- Come on!

970
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:51,545
- Pull it back! Come on!

971
01:10:51,613 --> 01:10:52,880
It's stuck!

972
01:10:58,853 --> 01:11:00,488
I'm going to break the window.

973
01:11:00,555 --> 01:11:04,057
Mom! Mom!

974
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:21,074
Kyle baby! Take my hands.

975
01:11:22,744 --> 01:11:24,011
You did it!

976
01:11:24,078 --> 01:11:26,414
Yeah. You did it!

977
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:39,860
Oh god.

978
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:43,664
No! No! Don't pull. Dad showed
me how.

979
01:11:48,102 --> 01:11:49,169
Is he ok?

980
01:11:49,237 --> 01:11:50,971
Yeah, he's ok!

981
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:53,106
Alright You have to go down the
ladder. You ready? Ok.

982
01:11:55,944 --> 01:11:57,177
You're so brave.

983
01:12:00,982 --> 01:12:03,984
- Kyle!
- No Dad!

984
01:12:05,086 --> 01:12:06,887
Carefully. Careful.

985
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:11,158
Dad!

986
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:14,127
Kyle! I'm so glad you're ok.

987
01:12:15,129 --> 01:12:17,064
You scared us.

988
01:12:22,904 --> 01:12:24,938
Cate! Cate!

989
01:12:27,141 --> 01:12:28,876
It's my ribs.

990
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:31,979
I'll be fine.

991
01:12:32,046 --> 01:12:33,247
Good job buddy.

992
01:12:33,314 --> 01:12:34,715
We gotta go.

993
01:12:34,783 --> 01:12:36,016
Let's go.

994
01:12:36,385 --> 01:12:37,618
Guys.

995
01:12:43,658 --> 01:12:46,960
Ok so we get to the public works. We
turn off the water and then-and then what?

996
01:12:47,028 --> 01:12:48,796
Are we heading back to the dam?

997
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:51,164
I thought that at first. Now I'm thinking
we can use the water to our advantage.

998
01:12:51,232 --> 01:12:53,033
Cause we gotta get them all in
one place.

999
01:12:53,101 --> 01:12:54,602
Somewhere with a reservoir.

1000
01:12:54,669 --> 01:12:55,903
Are we going with you?

1001
01:12:55,970 --> 01:12:58,706
I need to see you all safe
before Will and I leave,

1002
01:12:58,774 --> 01:13:00,441
Dad! No!

1003
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:03,811
Son it's ok. We're going to take
you somewhere where you'll be safe.

1004
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:06,980
There.

1005
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:10,584
We'll be safe here.
There are no water pipes around

1006
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:12,286
and it's a high vantage point,

1007
01:13:12,353 --> 01:13:17,024
water runs downhill so you'll see
the Lampreys before they see you.

1008
01:13:28,703 --> 01:13:31,839
- Are you ok, sweetie?
- Yeah I'll be fine.

1009
01:13:42,851 --> 01:13:44,151
Watch out!

1010
01:13:48,389 --> 01:13:50,290
Stay back! It's live!

1011
01:13:57,398 --> 01:13:59,900
We gotta get to the power
station. I've got an idea.

1012
01:14:08,743 --> 01:14:10,043
In here.

1013
01:14:11,379 --> 01:14:12,379
So it's like your stunboat, only
on a massive scale.

1014
01:14:12,447 --> 01:14:13,948
Exactly.

1015
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:17,317
But how are we going to attract
all the Lampreys to one location?

1016
01:14:17,385 --> 01:14:18,919
Bio salts.

1017
01:14:18,987 --> 01:14:20,153
Bio salts?

1018
01:14:20,221 --> 01:14:23,357
They're secreted by the liver.
To tract a mate.

1019
01:14:23,424 --> 01:14:24,324
That could work.

1020
01:14:24,392 --> 01:14:25,826
Exactly.

1021
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:27,695
Alright everyone, look...

1022
01:14:27,762 --> 01:14:29,597
We're going to get the livers
from the dead Lampreys.

1023
01:14:29,664 --> 01:14:33,400
Will and I are going to use them to draw
the live Lampreys, through the reservoir...

1024
01:14:33,468 --> 01:14:36,003
into the power station, where
we're going to electrocute them.

1025
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:38,038
Alright. We're not separating
again.

1026
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:39,740
I want to help.

1027
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,675
Us, too.

1028
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:45,112
Of course, I couldn't do it
without you.

1029
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:47,014
Now let's get to work.

1030
01:14:51,052 --> 01:14:52,686
Here's what they look like
buddy.

1031
01:15:00,261 --> 01:15:05,933
Keep these on you. They'll keep the live ones
away. For a little while. Come on. Let's go.

1032
01:15:10,805 --> 01:15:12,706
Everyone get in the truck.

1033
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:28,088
The smell is attracting them.
It's working.

1034
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:37,164
Something's got me!

1035
01:15:40,301 --> 01:15:45,238
Get them off! Get them off!

1036
01:15:51,546 --> 01:15:53,280
Don't move!

1037
01:15:53,514 --> 01:15:55,248
Get them off! Get them off!

1038
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:03,523
Oh my god! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1039
01:16:03,592 --> 01:16:05,525
No! Stay here!

1040
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:10,931
- Oh my god. I'm sorry!
- It's ok. I'm ok.

1041
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:12,265
Are you ok?

1042
01:16:12,333 --> 01:16:13,801
We need to go. Just go!

1043
01:16:13,868 --> 01:16:15,002
Let's go! Come on!

1044
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:16,269
Let's go!

1045
01:16:36,290 --> 01:16:38,291
Here's the power plant.

1046
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:47,367
Alright.

1047
01:16:47,435 --> 01:16:49,503
This is the main reservoir
beneath the power station.

1048
01:16:49,570 --> 01:16:52,106
This is right where we want the
Lampreys.

1049
01:16:52,373 --> 01:16:54,141
You guys go off there.

1050
01:16:54,208 --> 01:16:55,509
Come with me.

1051
01:16:57,445 --> 01:17:01,314
You guys go find the switch. We'll
use the livers to attract the Lampreys.

1052
01:17:10,058 --> 01:17:11,525
It's so dark. How do we
know they're down there?

1053
01:17:11,592 --> 01:17:12,126
One second. Listen.

1054
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:15,362
They're down there. Dump'em in.

1055
01:17:16,297 --> 01:17:18,132
Back up, back up, back up!

1056
01:17:18,199 --> 01:17:19,399
Are you guys ok?

1057
01:17:19,467 --> 01:17:21,301
Yeah, there's just some
Lampreys.

1058
01:17:21,369 --> 01:17:22,970
Alex, get the weed
whacker!

1059
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:24,538
Throw them in.

1060
01:17:36,484 --> 01:17:39,086
You guys finish this. I got that.
- Ok.

1061
01:17:44,492 --> 01:17:46,026
Alright, stay back.

1062
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:48,028
- Alex!
- Back up! Back up!

1063
01:17:53,401 --> 01:17:54,634
It's not gonna be enough.

1064
01:17:54,703 --> 01:17:56,136
We need more Lampreys.

1065
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:02,609
Look, I can go down the ladder, kill some
Lampreys, harvest some livers and come out quick.

1066
01:18:02,677 --> 01:18:05,278
- It'll work.
- No no. It's too risky. We gotta find another way.

1067
01:18:05,346 --> 01:18:09,249
- We don't have enough time.
- It's too risky. Now come on!

1068
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:11,351
I'm gonna stay here. Stay and
watch.

1069
01:18:13,088 --> 01:18:18,358
- Go! Be with you family!
- Alright alright! I'll be back! I'm coming!

1070
01:18:20,261 --> 01:18:23,964
Nicole! Nicole!

1071
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:42,282
Alright look, gut'em. We need
more livers.

1072
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:44,017
Where's Will?

1073
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:47,254
Dammit!

1074
01:18:47,321 --> 01:18:49,289
Take the kids and find the main
switch!

1075
01:18:55,696 --> 01:18:57,631
Will, I'm on my way!

1076
01:19:02,637 --> 01:19:05,672
You don't have to do
this! Come on!

1077
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:07,007
Get out of here Michael!

1078
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:08,475
Go on to the power station!

1079
01:19:08,542 --> 01:19:10,244
I'm not leaving without
you.

1080
01:19:10,311 --> 01:19:14,948
I'm not young like them. I don't
have a family like you!

1081
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:16,650
I don't have anything!

1082
01:19:16,717 --> 01:19:17,951
Let me have this!

1083
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:19,253
I'm not leaving without you.

1084
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,054
Michael! Go!

1085
01:19:21,122 --> 01:19:22,389
No!

1086
01:19:22,456 --> 01:19:24,224
- Stubborn fool!
- Takes one to know one.

1087
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:29,596
What you said about not having
anyone, it's not true! You have me!

1088
01:19:36,504 --> 01:19:38,138
Help me!

1089
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:39,472
Come on! Come on!

1090
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:41,541
- Go Michael! Go!
- No! No!

1091
01:19:41,609 --> 01:19:43,610
I'll be right behind you!

1092
01:19:43,678 --> 01:19:46,013
- I'll be right behind you!
- Alright.

1093
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:50,184
Just hold them off for a second.

1094
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:00,694
Will!

1095
01:20:04,598 --> 01:20:06,566
Give me your hand. Give me your
hand.

1096
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:10,170
Michael!

1097
01:20:10,538 --> 01:20:11,805
I can't.

1098
01:20:11,873 --> 01:20:15,142
I can't get good
footing. I'm slipping.

1099
01:20:15,776 --> 01:20:17,244
Don't worry, I got you.

1100
01:20:27,188 --> 01:20:28,621
Kyle! No! Go away!

1101
01:20:28,689 --> 01:20:30,623
Stay away! Stay away
Kyle!

1102
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:35,162
Which one leads to the
reservoir?

1103
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:37,264
Kyle, check your map.

1104
01:20:37,732 --> 01:20:39,432
Kyle?

1105
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:42,135
Flip the switch now!

1106
01:20:42,536 --> 01:20:44,204
- I think this is it!
- Just try it!

1107
01:20:44,272 --> 01:20:45,638
Now!

1108
01:20:45,706 --> 01:20:46,706
Do it!

1109
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:56,283
Yeah!

1110
01:21:08,863 --> 01:21:11,431
Good job!...Alex.

1111
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:23,210
<i>The Lamprey infestation has been
eradicated at Lake Charlevoix.</i>

1112
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:25,245
<i>County officials have advise
that it is now safe for</i>

1113
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:29,516
<i>residents to return to their homes.
The clean up process is under way.</i>

1114
01:21:29,583 --> 01:21:33,320
<i>But may take some time before
everything is back to normal.</i>

1115
01:21:34,455 --> 01:21:37,291
Hey! Did you say goodbye to Alex
already?

1116
01:21:37,358 --> 01:21:39,026
Yeah.

1117
01:21:45,466 --> 01:21:47,234
Everything ok?

1118
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:49,069
Everything is great. The city has my
recommendations. Now it's up to them.

1119
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:52,539
- Can we get out of here?
- Yes we can. The sooner the better.

1120
01:21:52,606 --> 01:21:53,873
Perfect.

1121
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:55,475
Ok. Let's go!

1122
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:57,244
- Come on!
- Let's go guys!

1123
01:21:57,312 --> 01:22:01,481
Are we leaving it? Yeah somebody
else get's to do it for us. Let's go.

1124
01:22:28,409 --> 01:22:30,410
Get out of here.

1125
01:22:30,478 --> 01:22:32,112
Come idiot, get out of here!

1126
01:22:34,849 --> 01:22:36,216
Get out of here!

1127
01:22:40,355 --> 01:22:42,489
Get out of here, you stupid
mutt!

1128
01:22:42,957 --> 01:22:44,358
Stop the car! Stop the car!

1129
01:22:44,425 --> 01:22:45,792
It's Scooter!

1130
01:22:46,494 --> 01:22:48,328
Scooter!

1131
01:22:48,396 --> 01:22:51,231
Come on buddy! Come on in!

1132
01:22:51,699 --> 01:22:53,433
Watch his tail. Watch his tail.
Watch his tail.
