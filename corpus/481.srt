1
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:40,000
Dark Water

2
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,871
And tomorrow we can practice
singing, ok?

3
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:26,112
-Yeah! -OK, see you tomorrow!

4
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,220
-Bye! -See ya!

5
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,590
See ya!

6
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,657
B'bye.

7
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:02,888
Yoshimi... no one's come for you?

8
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,094
Yoshimi Matsubara

9
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,379
Well, your husband has no objections
on the division of property.

10
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,843
So it's...

11
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,286
our daughter?

12
00:03:09,325 --> 00:03:10,652
Yes.

13
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:14,682
He's absolutely insistent
on being the legal guardian.

14
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,696
Why is he saying this now?

15
00:03:18,017 --> 00:03:22,727
He has completely neglected her
from the beginning.

16
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:26,670
Perhaps it's just that
you've never noticed. He may...

17
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,764
No, that's not it at all.

18
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,709
He forgets her birthday every year.

19
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,710
Where are you living?

20
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:42,050
Presently I'm looking for a place
for my daughter and me.

21
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:46,758
But I'll be deciding this week.

22
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:51,753
-Just a small question.
-Sure.

23
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:56,335
Is it true you had once received
psychiatric treatment?

24
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,707
Did he tell you that?

25
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:04,834
Yes.

26
00:04:08,347 --> 00:04:12,416
That was before we were married.

27
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:16,053
Over 10 years ago now.

28
00:04:16,996 --> 00:04:22,795
I was working proofreading novels
at the time, and...

29
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:26,354
You mean correcting spelling mistakes,
that sort of thing?

30
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,456
Right.

31
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:31,731
And some of the novels
I was working on then...

32
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,329
were extremely graphic and sadistic.

33
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,869
So it was a distraction to your work?

34
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:40,408
No you see, the content was
just so horrible...

35
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,211
and I had to read them
over and over again.

36
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:48,186
So that's when
you started going for treatment?

37
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:49,448
Yes.

38
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:50,716
I see.

39
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,753
Is that going to... ?

40
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,727
No, that shouldn't present a problem.

41
00:04:56,863 --> 00:05:01,459
You know I...
haven't been at all since then.

42
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,365
Don't worry about it.

43
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:06,737
And unless something major occurs,

44
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:12,039
the mother usually has the advantage
when the child is under seven.

45
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,803
Right.

46
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:38,898
My being seen before...
that doesn't matter anymore.

47
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,333
Hey, a fact is a fact.

48
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,475
What's wrong with speaking the truth?

49
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,711
I don't think
it will get you very far now.

50
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,295
Go straight along the river.

51
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,342
Right here? Thank you very much.

52
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,782
Tired?

53
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:31,248
This will be the last one, ok?

54
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,519
Alright, I'm going on ahead...

55
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,162
Ikuko

56
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:54,736
What do you think this room's for?

57
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,939
That's where you eat.

58
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,079
How about this one?

59
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,281
Where you sleep?

60
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,587
How about this little room here?

61
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,860
That's my room!

62
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:12,864
Ok, I'm off to see Ikuko's room! Bye!

63
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:14,229
Hey!

64
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,272
How many floors?

65
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,470
Gee, I don't know...

66
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,172
Can you count them?

67
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:07,083
One, two, three, four, five...

68
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:11,850
So what do you think?
A real bargain, I'd say.

69
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:14,592
We'll think about it.

70
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,491
Thank you.

71
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,696
Ms. Matsubara? -Yes.

72
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,329
Come right in.

73
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,971
Please, come in.

74
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,948
The apartment manager lives here too.

75
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,178
So you can feel safe
coming home at night.

76
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,961
Disappointed?

77
00:08:49,018 --> 00:08:51,087
It is a little old.

78
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,597
But it's built solid, you know.

79
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,963
Please.

80
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,672
Mr. Kamiya,

81
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:10,011
I told you to wipe this up.

82
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:15,418
Sorry,
a bucket of water spilled earlier.

83
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,337
After you.

84
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,013
Which way?

85
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,040
Here we are.

86
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,851
Go right in.

87
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,430
How old are you, Ikuko?

88
00:10:35,531 --> 00:10:36,896
Tell him how old you are.

89
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,630
Almost six.

90
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,538
Oh, you're in kindergarten.

91
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:41,803
Yup!

92
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,074
Where's my room?

93
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:48,442
How about this one here?

94
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,547
Yay!

95
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:59,046
The kindergarten is really close.

96
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:06,727
And next week
we're having the wallpaper replaced.

97
00:11:07,198 --> 00:11:09,326
Then it will look as good as new.

98
00:11:15,882 --> 00:11:18,033
The humidity in here is unreal.

99
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,112
Well, with all the rain we've had...

100
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:26,140
Most people use this room as a bedroom.

101
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:46,829
Oh, right...
I haven't shown you the kitchen.

102
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,571
Please.

103
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:56,113
We're having the kitchen done over too.

104
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,509
You'll find it very easy to use.

105
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:04,219
You know the other family
also liked the room.

106
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,355
''The early bird catches the worm.''

107
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:06,819
I see.

108
00:12:07,086 --> 00:12:09,338
It's just the two of you, right?

109
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,286
Yes.

110
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,790
Oh, then there's plenty of room!
A real steal.

111
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,236
Ikuko?

112
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,503
Ikuko?

113
00:12:32,317 --> 00:12:34,277
Maybe she went outside?

114
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:39,453
I'm going to go check.

115
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,261
Ikuko?

116
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:03,344
Excuse me,
has my little girl been here?

117
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,219
We haven't seen her.

118
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:08,646
Really...

119
00:13:08,768 --> 00:13:11,379
Baron, have you seen her?

120
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:15,758
He says he hasn't either.

121
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,230
Ikuko!

122
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,770
That's...

123
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,398
my daughter!

124
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,847
What floor was that?

125
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,482
Can't tell. They all look the same.

126
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,363
Ikuko?

127
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:18,672
Ikuko!

128
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,877
Mommy!

129
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,216
What were you doing?

130
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,515
I was looking all over for you.

131
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:28,184
Where did you get this?

132
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,124
It was lying on the ground.

133
00:15:30,182 --> 00:15:31,690
Where?

134
00:15:31,724 --> 00:15:33,391
Over there.

135
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,972
There aren't any kids living here now.

136
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:47,972
Well maybe some kids came over to play.

137
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,778
Your lucky day.

138
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:54,884
No.

139
00:15:57,716 --> 00:15:59,954
She can't have these.

140
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:04,052
We don't know who they belong to.

141
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:23,882
Careful now, honey.

142
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,040
No problem!

143
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,924
''Lost and Found''

144
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,192
Mine!

145
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:41,493
Hey!

146
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,125
Come back here!

147
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,004
You silly!

148
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,110
The sound really carries, huh.

149
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,982
Yeah, it really carries.

150
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,030
Gotta be careful, huh.

151
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:05,815
Yeah, careful!

152
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:35,809
Count each tooth 10 times now.

153
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,819
Yup, I am!

154
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,891
Chee-ze! Chee-ze!

155
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,565
Everyone, I'd like to introduce...

156
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,128
our new friend, Ikuko Matsubara.

157
00:17:57,459 --> 00:18:00,301
Hi, I'm Ikuko Matsubara.

158
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,775
I think we can do better than that!

159
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:10,048
Alright! Pleased to meet you!

160
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:56,558
Nice job!

161
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:57,850
What floor, ma'am?

162
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,000
First floor, please.

163
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,823
Certainly.

164
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,428
What's...

165
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,053
Hello?

166
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,089
Excuse me.

167
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:35,429
There's water leaking from our ceiling.

168
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:41,937
I'm Yoshimi Matsubara,
just moved into Rm. 305.

169
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:46,671
There's a wet spot on my ceiling,
and water dripping down from it.

170
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,180
Well the building is very old, you see.

171
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:53,741
So it gets a little rickety.

172
00:20:55,752 --> 00:20:57,788
Ok, and so...?

173
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,749
I'll make a note of it in the log.

174
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:22,913
Ok, everyone!

175
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,805
Quiet and listen up now.

176
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:30,583
I want to introduce our newest friend
on her first day!

177
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:33,789
Can you tell us your name?

178
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,721
Hi, I'm Ikuko Matsubara!

179
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,229
Now let's all be good friends
with Ikuko, ok?

180
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,267
Ok!

181
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,897
Please. -Thank you.

182
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:55,742
We believe in giving children
the freedom to do what they desire.

183
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,883
This is our basic
educational philosophy.

184
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,366
All our kids are really outgoing.

185
00:22:00,816 --> 00:22:02,630
Ikuko will make friends in no time.

186
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:04,114
Thank you.

187
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,252
Not at all.

188
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,794
Oh, thank you.

189
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,820
Thank you. -Please.

190
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,063
Sir, Kobayashi's here.

191
00:22:24,175 --> 00:22:26,677
I hear you called
Ms. Tsushima ''stupid''?

192
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:30,605
Come on, you're almost in
first grade now.

193
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,147
You said it to Kusano and Uesugi,
right?

194
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:37,084
That Ms. Tsushima was stupid.

195
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,085
Why is she ''stupid''?

196
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,693
What was it you said...

197
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:47,025
''Ms. Tsushima's stupid
because she's fat.''

198
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,257
Right?

199
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,032
What's that all about?
Everyone overweight is ''stupid''?

200
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,897
Well?

201
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,073
What are you crying for?!

202
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,910
Kobayashi!

203
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,193
Yes, why?
You think it's our fault?

204
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,717
Well, it's nobody's but your own!

205
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,571
Hello?

206
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,973
Hello?

207
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:55,981
The place may be old,
but I really doubt that's the cause.

208
00:25:56,254 --> 00:26:02,357
I think it's a plumbing leak
from somewhere above us.

209
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:06,122
Maybe the room right above you...

210
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:09,495
That's what I thought,
so I went up and checked.

211
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,331
But no one answered...

212
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,700
All done.

213
00:26:15,605 --> 00:26:19,168
Ok, I'll tell the apartment manager
myself tomorrow.

214
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,235
No, you see...

215
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:24,241
he won't lift a finger,
that's why I called you.

216
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:28,350
But I'm not involved with management,
you see.

217
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,786
But water is...

218
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:34,120
dripping down from my ceiling.

219
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,833
Ok, see you tomorrow!

220
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:10,224
Sorry to keep you waiting,
I was a little tied up.

221
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,054
Where were we...

222
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,625
Oh yes, Yoshimi Matsubara.

223
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:19,830
You have previous experience, correct?

224
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:22,134
I worked up until six years ago.

225
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:23,731
Right, right...

226
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:27,143
At Sanyu Publishing...
quite a large company.

227
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:31,071
As you can tell, we're quite small.

228
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,876
Why did you leave Sanyu?

229
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,418
I got married and then had a child.

230
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,487
Oh-right, right.

231
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:45,822
Are you sure you'd be happy here?

232
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:48,500
The pay wouldn't be as high, you know.

233
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:52,064
Well, I'm in a situation right now
where...

234
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:55,099
I really want to start working soon.

235
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,435
Of course,

236
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,875
I don't mean taking a job
just anywhere...

237
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:02,674
That's alright. I understand.

238
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:05,439
Mr. Kono!

239
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,577
Coming!

240
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,441
Excuse me again.

241
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,817
Sorry about this.

242
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:10,585
What is it?

243
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:20,664
Bye, now. Thank you.

244
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,833
There's mommy.

245
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:52,354
Hello?

246
00:28:54,565 --> 00:28:59,562
Who's picking up Yoshimi?
She's been waiting all alone for...

247
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:03,732
What? You can't just...!

248
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:12,509
So who's coming to pick her up today?

249
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,710
I see.

250
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,661
Yoshimi

251
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:33,268
Today, daddy's coming to get you.
So just a little bit longer, ok?

252
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,740
What about mommy?

253
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:39,836
Mommy? Well, she...

254
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:09,269
Sir, what can I say?

255
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,602
Tomorrow is just too early for us to...

256
00:30:13,331 --> 00:30:14,673
Ms. Matsubara?

257
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:18,244
Oh yes, I worked at...

258
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,716
Sanyu until I had my daughter
six years ago.

259
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,443
My job was proofreading,
and I look forward...

260
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:24,920
to working with you.

261
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:26,618
Right...

262
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:29,387
Hey, wait a second...

263
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,688
Ms. Matsubara!

264
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:40,936
Ikuko

265
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,840
Ikuko...

266
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:21,542
Have you seen this child?

267
00:31:22,646 --> 00:31:27,915
Mitsuko Kawai (5), born 11/3/93,
4'5'', 45lbs., long black hair.

268
00:31:30,585 --> 00:31:34,918
Last seen 7/14/99,
wearing a hooded yellow raincoat.

269
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,912
Ikuko!

270
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:03,741
Mommy!

271
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:05,622
What are you doing?!

272
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,514
I had no choice!

273
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:08,620
You didn't pick her up!

274
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:10,383
Stay out of this.

275
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,093
Waiting there all alone...

276
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:15,097
Do you know how that feels?!

277
00:32:18,068 --> 00:32:19,129
Come on.

278
00:32:30,352 --> 00:32:31,509
Let's go.

279
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:58,535
-It's so pretty. -It is, isn't it!

280
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:01,939
Want to try?

281
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,620
Let's get some on the way home.

282
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,899
Where should we do them?

283
00:33:24,812 --> 00:33:28,015
We'd get in trouble
on the balcony, huh.

284
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:32,401
Mommy?

285
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:39,740
I don't need anyone but you.

286
00:33:43,968 --> 00:33:47,155
Did daddy say something to you?

287
00:33:56,204 --> 00:33:58,534
I'm sorry.

288
00:34:03,968 --> 00:34:05,705
You know what?

289
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:12,238
I can handle anything,
just as long as you're with me.

290
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:37,274
You have one new message.

291
00:34:39,576 --> 00:34:42,769
This is Mr. Kono
from Mitsuba Publishing.

292
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:46,478
I'm really sorry for all the commotion
today at your interview.

293
00:34:46,686 --> 00:34:50,014
Anyway I was thinking, if you'd like,

294
00:34:50,669 --> 00:34:53,521
we could have you start
proofreading tomorrow.

295
00:34:53,531 --> 00:34:54,715
No!

296
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:55,986
What?

297
00:34:56,782 --> 00:34:58,953
I just got a job!

298
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,791
Really? Alright!

299
00:35:02,923 --> 00:35:04,934
You did it!

300
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:16,143
Top floor, ma'am?

301
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:17,112
Please!

302
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,515
Fourth floor - toys.

303
00:35:58,559 --> 00:35:59,819
Going up!

304
00:36:00,055 --> 00:36:01,725
Ok!

305
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:31,248
Come on!

306
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,967
No!

307
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:46,395
Ikuko, don't

308
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:50,262
Ow! That hurts!

309
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:30,709
There! I win!

310
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,250
But that's not yours, Mitsuko.

311
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,344
No fair.

312
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,821
What?

313
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:45,326
I like this one, so I'll give you
this one here.

314
00:37:45,827 --> 00:37:46,762
You like it?

315
00:37:47,381 --> 00:37:49,862
Ikuko, turn off the water
and come on out.

316
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,804
But she loves the bath...
We've been in here so long.

317
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:59,844
Come on now, time to come out.

318
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:13,449
Ok, let's play hide and seek!

319
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:14,718
Yay!

320
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,153
Once, twice, three...

321
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,526
Rock, paper, scissors!

322
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,390
Ok, Mao's ''it''!

323
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:31,070
One...two...three...

324
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:34,035
four...

325
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,439
Hey, can I...

326
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:40,849
This is our spot. Hide over there.

327
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,000
I'm ready!

328
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,695
What happened?

329
00:40:21,726 --> 00:40:23,042
Well...

330
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:27,319
She ''threw up and collapsed''?
That's never happened before.

331
00:40:28,702 --> 00:40:31,061
You probably forced her
to do something.

332
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:32,028
Not at all...

333
00:40:32,206 --> 00:40:33,428
You two...

334
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:35,661
Just what have you done to my child!

335
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,260
We haven't done anything.

336
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:38,303
But...

337
00:40:38,382 --> 00:40:40,067
Try and calm down.

338
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:42,330
Come on, let's talk.

339
00:40:45,419 --> 00:40:50,076
It seems that lately,
Ikuko has been behaving oddly.

340
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:53,940
Apparently she talks to herself a lot.

341
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:58,556
I also hear you're divorced.

342
00:41:01,624 --> 00:41:03,253
That must be affecting her.

343
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:08,092
We see this a lot
with children of divorced parents.

344
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:54,734
''Come home soon, Mitsuko''

345
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,541
As a matter of fact,
she used to behave oddly too.

346
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,552
However in Mitsuko's case,

347
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:07,551
her mother had abandoned her.
Just got up and left one day.

348
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:09,960
You never heard of her?

349
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:13,897
The girl who disappeared two years ago.

350
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:18,632
Mitsuko Kawai.
She was one of our kids here.

351
00:42:33,207 --> 00:42:35,080
Is she...

352
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:37,347
still missing?

353
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:39,319
Yes.

354
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:44,651
I think she was kidnapped
by some perverted individual.

355
00:42:49,507 --> 00:42:50,795
Excuse me?

356
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:56,463
Apparently you're late picking up Ikuko
almost every day.

357
00:42:57,141 --> 00:43:00,770
''Almost every day''?
That's an exaggeration...

358
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:03,180
Oh?

359
00:43:04,518 --> 00:43:08,308
Well, sometimes...

360
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:11,711
I get there late because of work,
but really...

361
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,155
''Every day'' ...who told you that?

362
00:43:15,189 --> 00:43:19,161
And is it true you yanked her arm
and dislocated her shoulder?

363
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:20,594
Dislocated it?

364
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:24,657
Why no... of course not!

365
00:43:25,925 --> 00:43:29,440
And how about wandering around
aimlessly at night?

366
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:31,801
Do you deny this?

367
00:43:41,517 --> 00:43:43,350
I was a child then.

368
00:43:45,455 --> 00:43:47,754
My parents had divorced.

369
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:52,392
Apparently I did such things
without realizing it.

370
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:56,490
But it was only for a short period.

371
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:01,831
And I can assure you
that would never happen now.

372
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:07,541
If the mother can't show
she can raise the child...

373
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:09,745
Stop exaggerating everything!

374
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,237
What are you talking about?!

375
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,304
Don't deny it!

376
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:15,350
-Please, let's remain calm.
-Who is he!

377
00:44:15,759 --> 00:44:19,685
I'm Mr. Hamada's private lawyer
Masato Nishioka...

378
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,591
Using a guy like this...

379
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:23,456
as your personal spy!

380
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,295
Hey, I'm just worried about Ikuko.

381
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,464
Since when?

382
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:33,900
I don't care how you rationalize it...

383
00:44:34,472 --> 00:44:35,800
stop playing dirty!!

384
00:44:36,013 --> 00:44:37,633
Please, both of you.

385
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:39,333
We need to set the next date.

386
00:44:39,611 --> 00:44:40,773
Right. Sorry.

387
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,896
So it was you...

388
00:45:08,002 --> 00:45:10,099
And the bag... you put it there.

389
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,204
What?

390
00:45:11,215 --> 00:45:13,140
The red bag, on the roof!

391
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,373
-Why did you do that?!
-What are you talking about!

392
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,473
-Why?! -Ms. Matsubara!

393
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:22,348
Take it easy!

394
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,287
Let's go inside, Mr. Hamada.

395
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,737
Are you alright?

396
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:57,449
I take it... you're still
in the middle of mediations.

397
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:08,264
If you let them see you like this,

398
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:12,564
they'll think you're unstable,
which can only hurt you.

399
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:23,709
My secretary's off today,
so this may be a little strong.

400
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:32,652
Woops! Forgot the cream and sugar.

401
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:37,360
If they take her away from me...

402
00:46:38,289 --> 00:46:40,158
I...

403
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,239
Your husband seems pretty serious.

404
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,101
He could move against you anywhere,
anytime.

405
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,710
They say with children under seven,

406
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:03,878
the mother has the advantage.

407
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:09,457
But if you continue along this path,
growing weaker by the day,

408
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:13,292
it will be nearly impossible for you
to gain custody.

409
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,103
In any case,
now is the most critical time.

410
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:24,766
If you want to continue
living with your daughter,

411
00:47:26,942 --> 00:47:29,505
the first thing you need to do
is pull yourself together.

412
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:34,916
Right...

413
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:40,980
Come on, we can't get very far
like that now.

414
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:45,526
It'll be alright.
Let's fight this together.

415
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:50,832
Thank you.

416
00:48:10,994 --> 00:48:13,022
Did she eat her lunch?

417
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:14,416
Sure did.

418
00:48:15,282 --> 00:48:18,057
Girls are just the cutest things.

419
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:32,772
Auntie, leaving already?

420
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:35,903
Yup, have to stop off at the store.

421
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:38,413
You know how he leaves it all to me.

422
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,414
Sorry, I know it's far...

423
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:43,878
You're the only one I can ask.

424
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:45,451
That's ok.

425
00:48:45,929 --> 00:48:48,653
You've done well with Ikuko.

426
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,690
A far cry from the mother you had.

427
00:48:52,792 --> 00:48:56,794
She just couldn't think of anyone
but herself...

428
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:57,959
Ok, see ya.

429
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,502
Thanks.

430
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:09,004
Bye.

431
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,142
Thanks.

432
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:29,630
Ikuko...

433
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:31,874
Ikuko

434
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:47,682
Ikuko!

435
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,444
Ikuko...

436
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:40,742
Mommy!

437
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:27,656
Ikuko...

438
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,398
Ikuko

439
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:35,885
Ikuko?

440
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,886
Are you there?

441
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:59,243
It's me... Is Ikuko with you?

442
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:00,577
No.

443
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:01,842
Don't lie.

444
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:04,586
I wouldn't lie about that!

445
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:08,454
Why, what happened?

446
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:14,128
Yoshimi! What's going on?!

447
00:57:14,167 --> 00:57:15,596
Ikuko!

448
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,965
Iku... Ikuko!

449
00:57:37,393 --> 00:57:40,250
Hello! Open up!

450
00:57:41,137 --> 00:57:42,618
Hello!

451
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:44,560
Ikuko, are you in there?

452
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:46,293
Ikuko?

453
00:57:46,423 --> 00:57:48,121
Ikuko...

454
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:11,020
Ikuko?

455
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,487
Are you here?

456
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:29,161
Ikuko?

457
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:37,707
Ikuko!

458
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:24,058
Shoji and Mitsuko Kawai

459
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:29,428
Mitsuko Kawai...

460
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:06,094
May I come in?

461
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:08,736
Sure.

462
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:24,811
What are you doing?

463
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:26,451
We're moving out.

464
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:33,652
So Ikuko will...

465
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:36,221
have to change kindergarten again?

466
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:38,490
That's right.

467
01:00:38,912 --> 01:00:41,200
Why not wait a while?

468
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:45,105
I can't.

469
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:50,402
Ms. Matsubara,

470
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,677
... you know we're at a disadvantage
as it stands.

471
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:59,104
If you move again now, think of how
the committee will view this.

472
01:00:59,289 --> 01:01:01,482
I don't want to hear that now!

473
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:04,158
Mitsuko has returned
to the apartment upstairs,

474
01:01:04,227 --> 01:01:07,162
and she's trying to take Ikuko away!

475
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:14,626
So the room upstairs was open...

476
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,671
I realize you're busy,

477
01:01:19,742 --> 01:01:23,303
...but I'd like you to see this.

478
01:01:25,024 --> 01:01:26,514
What the... ?

479
01:01:26,733 --> 01:01:28,172
Mr. Kamiya!

480
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:31,152
But I locked it...

481
01:01:47,123 --> 01:01:50,095
Wow, you were right...

482
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:55,137
What in the name of...

483
01:01:57,947 --> 01:02:00,844
The family of that girl
who disappeared...

484
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:02,707
when did they move out?

485
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:06,152
Well, let's see...

486
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:09,191
the end of last year, wasn't it?

487
01:02:12,387 --> 01:02:16,496
The father lived here
for a while by himself.

488
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,933
Said his little girl would have
no place to come home to.

489
01:02:21,254 --> 01:02:22,364
Which means,

490
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:29,173
the water in here may have been running
for the past six months.

491
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:33,409
Mr. Kamiya

492
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:38,113
Ms. Matsubara complained to you
about this, didn't she?

493
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:41,318
Did you look into it?

494
01:02:44,247 --> 01:02:45,658
Mr. Kamiya

495
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:49,789
There are a lot of people
in line for your job.

496
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:52,560
A lot of people to replace you.

497
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,393
Mr. Ohta

498
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:57,329
I believe she also called you.

499
01:02:57,386 --> 01:02:59,465
We'll... I'm uh...

500
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:00,600
Well...

501
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:04,735
what about the footsteps I heard?

502
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:09,907
Well, we know Ikuko was in here.

503
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:13,212
So someone else
could have gotten in too.

504
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:21,662
The bag was lying right here.

505
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:31,034
Did you throw it away again?

506
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,268
Well, I threw it away once.

507
01:03:33,336 --> 01:03:35,310
But that's all I know.

508
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:39,040
So it's disappeared...

509
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:44,812
Maybe part of some superstition.

510
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:48,889
Either way, it must be the local kids.

511
01:03:56,305 --> 01:04:00,301
Look how dirty this thing is...

512
01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:01,768
Do you have it cleaned?

513
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,863
That's the cleaning company's job.

514
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,703
I can go now, right?

515
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:07,240
Woops...

516
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:09,744
Think he's upset?

517
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:14,374
And then right over there,

518
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:16,577
I saw someone.

519
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,317
Did you get a clear look?

520
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:23,149
It was just for an instant,
but I saw something.

521
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:27,861
But I'll bet no one was there
when you checked.

522
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,022
Well, yes...

523
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:36,094
See the highway over there?

524
01:04:37,939 --> 01:04:40,975
And the neon sign on that building.

525
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:45,637
This water tank is exposed to light
from all around.

526
01:04:46,505 --> 01:04:50,318
So if something passed
in front of the light,

527
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:53,316
it would cast a shadow on the tank.

528
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:59,428
Then it would be natural for your eyes
to play tricks on you.

529
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:02,961
Although,

530
01:05:03,632 --> 01:05:08,128
coming up here all alone at night
and seeing what you saw...

531
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:10,898
that would scare anyone.

532
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:38,332
Your husband's lawyer
has also looked this over,

533
01:05:39,082 --> 01:05:41,436
and has agreed to the terms.

534
01:05:42,165 --> 01:05:45,774
I don't think this will
compromise your position at all.

535
01:05:46,562 --> 01:05:48,203
Thank you.

536
01:05:49,908 --> 01:05:50,806
Just remember,

537
01:05:50,921 --> 01:05:56,045
this is simply a set of legal points
worked out by lawyers.

538
01:05:56,319 --> 01:06:03,228
So just continue with your daily
routine, and try to remain focused.

539
01:06:03,319 --> 01:06:03,896
I will.

540
01:06:04,104 --> 01:06:07,686
Hey, you're just about there.

541
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:12,994
Ikuko.

542
01:06:13,629 --> 01:06:15,269
Ready to go back to school?

543
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:16,727
Sure!

544
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:19,504
Well, you sure seem better!

545
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:21,600
I would...

546
01:06:21,677 --> 01:06:25,408
really like to thank you
for all you've done.

547
01:06:26,405 --> 01:06:29,014
By myself, I was so confused...

548
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:30,045
Not at all.

549
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:34,379
I can see Ikuko needs you.

550
01:06:34,624 --> 01:06:38,487
And that you need her. That's all.

551
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:50,831
I can see now
that I need to be stronger.

552
01:06:53,276 --> 01:06:56,704
But it's not over yet.

553
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:01,009
The final decision will probably
be made at the next session.

554
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:03,918
In any case,

555
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:07,478
even if something happens before then,

556
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:09,857
don't act alone.

557
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:13,054
Contact me immediately.

558
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:15,859
I will.

559
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:19,498
One, two, three!

560
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:44,153
All auntie makes is okayu rice.

561
01:07:45,197 --> 01:07:48,494
Hey come on, you were sick.

562
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:51,858
It's good though, isn't it?

563
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:53,999
I like this better.

564
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:02,620
She brought her own water
to make dinner.

565
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:03,812
She did?

566
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:07,047
Yeah, she said
the water here is no good.

567
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:10,518
Yeah...

568
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:15,214
the water here is
definitely not the cleanest.

569
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:18,356
Are you sure about school tomorrow?

570
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:20,689
I'm sure!

571
01:08:21,763 --> 01:08:24,632
Alright! Let's get your things ready.

572
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:28,001
Ok, I'll go look for your bag.

573
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:49,388
Ikuko... how did this get in here?

574
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:51,216
I don't know.

575
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:53,223
Did you go back to the roof?

576
01:08:53,626 --> 01:08:54,222
I swear, I don't know.

577
01:08:54,437 --> 01:08:57,189
I won't be mad,
so just tell me the truth.

578
01:08:57,834 --> 01:08:59,534
Did you go up there?

579
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:01,863
No!

580
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:10,678
Ok.

581
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:13,038
I'm sorry.

582
01:09:33,089 --> 01:09:36,095
Connecting to personal voicemail...

583
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:39,336
Hello, this is Kishida...

584
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:56,283
Hello, Kishida Law Offices.

585
01:09:56,459 --> 01:10:00,056
Hi, my name is Yoshimi Matsubara.

586
01:10:00,129 --> 01:10:01,628
Is Mr. Kishida there?

587
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:06,192
He's out at the moment, and
we don't expect him back today.

588
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:07,630
Is that so?

589
01:10:08,337 --> 01:10:11,001
Well, thank you very much.

590
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,447
No!

591
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:38,460

592
01:10:42,038 --> 01:10:43,027

01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:25,453
What happened?

601
01:19:27,796 --> 01:19:29,821
What the...

602
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:36,633
There we are.

603
01:19:36,838 --> 01:19:39,336
I'll never leave you alone again.

604
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:43,069
I'm always going to be with you.

605
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:46,576
It's going to be ok.

606
01:22:08,116 --> 01:22:09,890
Ikuko?

607

608
01:22:17,002 --> 01:22:18,226
Mommy?

609
01:22:35,952 --> 01:22:38,442
Mommy!

610
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:44,025
Mommy?

611
01:22:49,031 --> 01:22:49,859
Mommy!

612
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:51,466
No!

613
01:22:52,164 --> 01:22:53,941
Stay there!

614
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:02,408
Please... Stop...

615
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:04,537
I'm not your mother!

616
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:06,238
Mommy!

617
01:23:08,384 --> 01:23:10,952
No, Ikuko!

618
01:23:13,088 --> 01:23:14,087
Stop!

619
01:23:20,696 --> 01:23:22,154
Ikuko!

620
01:23:43,318 --> 01:23:44,608
I'm...

621
01:23:46,288 --> 01:23:48,479
your mother.

622
01:24:25,027 --> 01:24:26,289
Mommy!

623
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:23,075
Mommy!

624

10 years later

625
01:27:14,295 --> 01:27:15,395
-Let's give her a call. -Ok.

626
01:27:25,807 --> 01:27:27,900
Hello? We're here.

627
01:27:28,376 --> 01:27:31,243
Ok, we'll be waiting here... bye.

628
01:27:31,313 --> 01:27:32,105
Is she coming?

629
01:27:32,681 --> 01:27:34,347
Yeah, said she'd be right down.

630
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:03,600
-Let's get some ice cream.
-Alright!

631
01:28:03,678 --> 01:28:04,102
Come on.

632
01:28:06,248 --> 01:28:08,639
Ikuko, what about you?

633
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:12,015
What?... No, I'm all set.

634
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:23,822
I don't remember much from
when I was in kindergarten.

635
01:28:25,166 --> 01:28:28,030
Just that for a very brief period...

636
01:28:28,103 --> 01:28:32,731
I was living together with my mother.

637
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:40,838
-Mommy! -I'm sorry, honey.

638
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:44,314
See? There she is!

639
01:28:44,485 --> 01:28:47,079
-I'm so sorry. -Not at all.

640
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:48,850
Ok, see you tomorrow.

641
01:28:48,923 --> 01:28:49,821
Bye!

642
01:28:49,891 --> 01:28:51,085
B'bye.

Yoshimi and Ikuko Matsubara

644
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:44,788
Mom?

645
01:32:51,364 --> 01:32:52,225
Welcome home.

646
01:32:54,802 --> 01:32:57,098
You've gotten so big.

647
01:33:00,982 --> 01:33:02,304
Why... ?

648
01:33:04,045 --> 01:33:06,479
Nobody told me.

649
01:33:09,217 --> 01:33:11,753
Have you been living here
all this time?

650
01:33:20,628 --> 01:33:23,559
My friend's house is right near here.

651
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:26,257
I'm going over there today.

652
01:33:27,035 --> 01:33:29,201
It's next to my old kindergarten.

653
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:31,732
The Shimizus, do you know them?

654
01:33:34,475 --> 01:33:37,036
That's my kindergarten, isn't it...

655
01:33:38,321 --> 01:33:39,671
over at the bus stop.

656
01:33:45,353 --> 01:33:48,513
This used to be... my glass.

657
01:33:57,832 --> 01:34:01,763
So you're already in high school...

658
01:34:03,404 --> 01:34:05,100
How time flies!

659
01:34:09,677 --> 01:34:14,080
If only I had known, I would've
come to see you long before this.

660
01:34:14,848 --> 01:34:16,111
That's ok.

661
01:34:17,718 --> 01:34:20,043
You came to see me today.

662
01:34:25,525 --> 01:34:26,192
Mom?

663
01:34:29,063 --> 01:34:31,458
Remember when you said,

664
01:34:31,599 --> 01:34:35,196
that you could handle anything
just as long as I was with you?

665
01:34:37,138 --> 01:34:38,164
Of course.

666
01:34:39,607 --> 01:34:44,141
Do you... still feel that way?

667
01:34:47,148 --> 01:34:49,007
Yes, I do.

668
01:34:50,851 --> 01:34:52,182
Good.

669
01:34:54,221 --> 01:34:55,313
Mom...

670
01:34:56,424 --> 01:34:59,188
Could I live here together with you?

671
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:06,188
I'll tell dad myself, alright?

672
01:35:07,068 --> 01:35:09,062
I'm sure he'd be ok with it.

673
01:35:10,237 --> 01:35:14,731
He has a new wife now,
and more children.

674
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:19,245
I...

675
01:35:31,625 --> 01:35:33,286
Ikuko...

676
01:35:40,701 --> 01:35:42,361
I'm sorry, honey...

677
01:35:44,272 --> 01:35:46,305
that we can't be together.

678
01:36:18,132 --> 01:36:19,669
Mom?

679
01:36:24,745 --> 01:36:26,142
Mom!

680
01:37:37,728 --> 01:37:40,952
My mother was here all that time,

681
01:37:41,022 --> 01:37:43,351
