1
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,968
Okay.

2
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:51,468
We feeling better yet?

3
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,971
Well...

4
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,850
...you sure knowhow to make a guy happy.

5
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,651
This would be perfect if
Iwasn't afraid I was going to

6
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:08,068
lose an eye.

7
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:11,155
Sorry

8
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,658
My fondue wenton a.

9
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,243
Very dangerous.

10
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:17,285
I think I the last one I had
was when my 8th grade

11
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,997
girlfriend took mefor my birthday.

12
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,164
Yeah?

13
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:21,082
Mhm.

14
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:22,792
I thought you said
therewere no girls before me.

15
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:27,714
No, what I said was there
wereno great loves before you.

16
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:30,591
I wish I was your8th grade girlfriend.

17
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:33,594
I bet you were so adorable.

18
00:01:33,678 --> 00:01:35,972
But that might bebroken up by now.

19
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:39,475
I don't plan on everbreaking up with you.

20
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:42,437
I don't care whenwe would have met.

21
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,355
Whenever we laid eyes
oneach other we would have

22
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,525
fallen madly in love.

23
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,777
You're a hopeless romantic.

24
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:51,696
Admit it, it's true.

25
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,698
Right, whenever we laid
eyeson each other we would have

26
00:01:53,824 --> 00:01:56,868
fallen madly in love.

27
00:01:58,162 --> 00:02:00,663
Say it like you mean it!

28
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:05,752
Whenever we laid eyes
oneach other we would have

29
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:09,465
fallen hopelessly, completely in love.

30
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:10,673
Better.

31
00:02:16,012 --> 00:02:19,390
All right, so why did it takeyou
so long to find me, huh?

32
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:22,685
Perhaps because you
werebusy marrying someone else.

33
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:25,773
How could you let me
makesuch a stupid mistake?

34
00:02:25,898 --> 00:02:26,815
I didn't even know you.

35
00:02:26,899 --> 00:02:29,108
My point exactly.

36
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:30,235
You're right.

37
00:02:30,402 --> 00:02:32,445
I'm sorry; I shouldhave found you earlier.

38
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,280
You should have.

39
00:02:38,077 --> 00:02:40,788
Well maybe I can makeit
up to you right now.

40
00:02:40,913 --> 00:02:42,706
Oh yeah?

41
00:02:51,423 --> 00:02:54,009
Janie?

42
00:03:02,726 --> 00:03:04,269
What just happened in there?

43
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:06,563
Do you really think
aftereverything I went through in

44
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:09,525
my first marriage that I'dbe
prepared to do it again?

45
00:03:09,608 --> 00:03:11,485
Yeah, I hope so.

46
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,278
Doug was awful.

47
00:03:13,404 --> 00:03:14,780
It was a nightmare!

48
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:16,782
I'm not asking youto marry Doug baby,

49
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:18,283
I'm asking you to marry me.

50
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:20,953
It's all the same.

51
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,747
Sorry, I didn't meanit the way it sounded.

52
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:27,543
It's just... it'll end
withsomeone's heart being

53
00:03:27,626 --> 00:03:30,588
completely shattered and
Ican't sign up for that again.

54
00:03:30,672 --> 00:03:32,673
What are you saying?

55
00:03:32,798 --> 00:03:34,299
It's me, it's George.

56
00:03:34,383 --> 00:03:36,927
I want to spend the
restof my life with you.

57
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,305
I want us to bemarried, to be a family.

58
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:42,182
Well I want us justthe way we are.

59
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:45,644
Please, baby please;
We'vegot everything already.

60
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:47,479
I don't have a wife, youdon't
have a husband and we

61
00:03:47,563 --> 00:03:49,189
don't have marriedand forever.

62
00:03:49,314 --> 00:03:51,650
Did you know that foreverlasts
no longer than a year

63
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:53,527
and usually ends in divorce?

64
00:03:53,652 --> 00:03:54,611
Well not if you marrythe right person.

65
00:03:54,696 --> 00:03:57,323
Really, how canyou be so sure?

66
00:03:57,448 --> 00:04:01,995
I've never been so
sureof anything in my life.

67
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:06,833
I just... I don'thave that luxury.

68
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,501
I don't wantanybody but you.

69
00:04:08,626 --> 00:04:09,627
Nothing's going to change.

70
00:04:09,711 --> 00:04:11,296
I don't want anyonebut you either,

71
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:13,089
that's what I'mtrying to tell you.

72
00:04:13,173 --> 00:04:17,969
A romance like oursshould end in marriage.

73
00:04:18,052 --> 00:04:20,847
Well for an add man, that'sa great ;

74
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,433
Marriage where romance ends.

75
00:04:23,516 --> 00:04:25,642
I want to be your husband; I
want to spend my life making

76
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,020
you happy.

77
00:04:27,145 --> 00:04:29,647
I am happy. I am.

78
00:04:29,731 --> 00:04:32,942
I thought Dougloved me, you know.

79
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:36,404
But all he wanted was a
wifewho was smart enough to take

80
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:38,740
to business dinners and
dumbenough not to know he was

81
00:04:38,865 --> 00:04:41,201
messing aroundall over town.

82
00:04:41,285 --> 00:04:44,245
Do you love me Janie?

83
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,788
Completely.

84
00:04:45,872 --> 00:04:48,041
Do you want to be with me?

85
00:04:48,124 --> 00:04:51,920
All the time.

86
00:04:53,422 --> 00:04:55,925
Then stop thinking about
usas some other relationship

87
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,676
you once had.

88
00:04:59,052 --> 00:05:03,514
We're us; We'remeant to be together.

89
00:05:03,598 --> 00:05:08,312
We were meant to
betogether a long time ago.

90
00:05:14,776 --> 00:05:17,696
The ring is amazing.

91
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,663
Marry me?

92
00:06:06,078 --> 00:06:07,913

Oh dear Jane got a ton
ofmail today; It's all there.

Hey, stop reading my mail.

101
00:06:22,136 --> 00:06:24,513
They say dear Jane, not dear Freddy.

Great.

117
00:07:07,223 --> 00:07:08,516

Tucks pads?

119
00:07:10,727 --> 00:07:12,354
When did we becomethe hygiene kings?

120
00:07:12,437 --> 00:07:13,855
When that putz became VP.

121
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,358
There is one bit of businessl'd
like to clear up before

122
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:19,110
you all leave.

123
00:07:19,194 --> 00:07:24,324
You are no longer employedas
a Johnson Advertising.

124

Welcome to Johnsonand Harrington.

125
00:07:28,536 --> 00:07:29,788
Partner?

126
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:30,747
Partner?

127
00:07:30,872 --> 00:07:31,873
Partner!

128
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:35,794
I can't believethis is happening.

129
00:07:36,127 --> 00:07:37,879
Wake up and smell the
springfresh sneakers spray Harvey,

130
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:38,880
you just did.

131
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:40,841
And I'm out of here.

132
00:07:42,217 --> 00:07:44,677
You'd still be pushing
amail cart if it wasn't for me.

133
00:07:44,761 --> 00:07:45,720
I know he soldyour sketches,

134
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:48,098
presented the Mitsubishicampaign
without you and the

135
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,849
rest is history.

136
00:08:02,153 --> 00:08:03,905
What?

137
00:08:03,988 --> 00:08:06,408
When did you andGeorge break up?

138
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:09,202
What?

139
00:08:09,286 --> 00:08:13,248
Dear Jane, mymother-in-law's a very sweet

140
00:08:13,331 --> 00:08:15,125
woman and we'vealways gotten along.

141
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,585
In December she's havingsurgery
and my husband wants

142
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:20,089
her to stay with usfor the holidays.

143
00:08:20,172 --> 00:08:23,007
We usually stay with
myfamily at that time of the year

144
00:08:23,092 --> 00:08:25,761
and I'm not sure how
they'regoing to feel about this.

145
00:08:25,886 --> 00:08:28,305
How should I handle
thissituation without upsetting

146
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:29,557
my parents?

147
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,893
Signed, a little mixed up.

148
00:08:35,354 --> 00:08:39,441
Dear Mixed up: Divorceseems
the only alternative.

149
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:42,403
Your husband's inconsideraterequest
shows that he puts

150
00:08:42,486 --> 00:08:44,113
his mother before you.

151
00:08:44,196 --> 00:08:48,784
This is unacceptable, sincerely, Dear Jane.

152
00:08:48,909 --> 00:08:50,494
I can't print those.

153
00:08:50,619 --> 00:08:52,455
They're like those whackedout
answers you wrote when

154
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,249
you and Doug broke up.

155
00:08:55,332 --> 00:08:57,960
All right, here it is.

156
00:08:58,085 --> 00:08:59,545
George and I got engaged.

157
00:08:59,628 --> 00:09:02,673
It might have inspiredsome
of those responses.

158
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,966
You're engaged?

159
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:06,303
We got engaged.

160
00:09:06,427 --> 00:09:09,848
Oh, oh my goodness.

161
00:09:09,972 --> 00:09:11,265
Gorgeous.

162
00:09:11,348 --> 00:09:12,183
Gorgeous.

163
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:13,351
Yeah, I know, its mygrandmother's ring.

164
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:15,436
He had it reset with
thediamond. He knew I loved it.

165
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,563
I love that George.

166
00:09:16,646 --> 00:09:17,606
Yeah, me too.

167
00:09:17,897 --> 00:09:20,649
Oh and wasting no time,
this is the invite to the

168
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:25,572
engagement party my
ecstaticallyhappy mother is throwing.

169
00:09:27,157 --> 00:09:29,241
Oh congratulations.

170
00:09:34,122 --> 00:09:36,416
You okay?

171
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,544
Yeah, just... I did this already.

172
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:43,130
Yeah, I know, I was there.

173
00:09:43,214 --> 00:09:45,217
It was almost exactlyten years ago.

174
00:09:45,342 --> 00:09:49,012
Nov. 6th, 1999 a day
thatwill live in infamy.

175
00:09:49,095 --> 00:09:50,555
Well look at the bright side,

176
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,933
at least your mother
won'tbe sitting Shiva this time.

177
00:09:53,016 --> 00:09:54,433
Thank you, thanks for that.

178
00:09:57,978 --> 00:10:00,690
My mother thewedding coordinator.

179
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:02,817
So she cut out a fewpictures
of wedding gowns.

180
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:04,736
A few pictures?

181
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,905
She's had a Jane's

184
00:10:13,703 --> 00:10:16,206

185
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:18,124
She never liked him did she?

186
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,794
No, always thoughthe was a jerk.

187
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:23,171
You know I didn't even getit
when he showed up half an

188
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,423
hour late for ourwedding rehearsal.

189
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:27,300
Well how could you know
hewas in the honeymoon suite

190
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:29,929

191

Oh, I don't know.

192
00:10:32,138 --> 00:10:34,975
You know I swear I saw him
winkat her during the ceremony.

193
00:10:35,058 --> 00:10:36,060
I'm not kidding.

194
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:38,854
Well as long as your mom
isour wedding coordinator,

195
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:41,190
I can prettymuch guarantee history is

196
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:43,275
not going to repeat itself.

197
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,777
Very funny.

198
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,238

00:10:48,738 --> 00:10:49,907
I love you too baby.

201
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:52,702
Oh, yellow light, make a wish.

202
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:57,247
Make it through yourwish comes true.

203
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,501
Hey, you didn't make a wish.

204
00:11:00,585 --> 00:11:02,669
I didn't want to be greedy.

205
00:11:02,753 --> 00:11:04,964
Mine already came true.

206
00:11:05,088 --> 00:11:06,674
Ah.

207
00:11:06,756 --> 00:11:08,550
All right, you're right,
you're absolutely right.

208
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:09,760
This is going to be great.

209
00:11:09,885 --> 00:11:12,263
It's going to be thebest thing for me.

210
00:11:12,346 --> 00:11:14,307
Starting tonight I'm goingto
enjoy the fact that we're

211
00:11:14,432 --> 00:11:16,559
getting married.

212
00:11:17,768 --> 00:11:19,687
It's so nice to see you,
I'm glad you could make it.

213
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:25,443
You know, marriage is
notsomething you enter into

214
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:28,237
frivolously, youknow what I mean?

215
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,865
It involves avery sacred vow.

216
00:11:30,948 --> 00:11:32,867
The vows that I take with George,

217
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,662
I will honor allthe days of my life.

218
00:11:36,787 --> 00:11:39,540
My mommy says that
yourfirst marriage was a disaster

219
00:11:39,624 --> 00:11:43,628
and that $100 weddinggift
was a big waste of money.

220
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:45,713
And daddy says he's
notgetting into that monkey

221
00:11:45,796 --> 00:11:49,717
suit again foranybody, not even you.

222
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,469
There's a specialwedding rule;

223
00:11:51,594 --> 00:11:53,639
Mommy has a whole year
toget you a present and this

224
00:11:53,764 --> 00:11:56,724

make sure it sticks.

228
00:12:11,156 --> 00:12:13,407

229
00:12:13,492 --> 00:12:15,159
Look into that crystalball

230
00:12:15,285 --> 00:12:16,494

231
00:12:16,577 --> 00:12:19,330
Crystal ballsare for amateurs.

232
00:12:19,413 --> 00:12:29,424
I see a crowded room,
celebration of some sort...

233
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:32,761
we're goingto go find her.

234
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:35,846

235
00:12:36,848 --> 00:12:40,101
Put that bottle down rightnow
and get back to your party.

236

00:12:58,036 --> 00:12:58,954
You need to get back to the living room.

245
00:12:59,121 --> 00:13:00,122

259
00:13:34,824 --> 00:13:37,075
I just want tosay a few words.

Come here.

261
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:45,459
When I first met Jane I
knewfate had played its hand and

262
00:13:45,584 --> 00:13:48,044
I was ready.

263
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:51,340
I remember when I
calledher for our first date...

264
00:13:51,424 --> 00:13:53,425
She's a little old foranother go-around.

265
00:13:53,508 --> 00:13:56,637
I hope she's notplanning to wear white.

266
00:13:56,762 --> 00:13:58,097
I don't think she shouldhave
worn white to the first

267
00:13:58,222 --> 00:13:59,431
one, you know what I mean?

268
00:13:59,514 --> 00:14:00,558
Mhm.

269
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:02,602
Let's hope this one can
waituntil after the wedding to

270
00:14:02,685 --> 00:14:03,728
start cheating on her.

271
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,105
Or at least tillafter the rehearsal.

272
00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:09,734

forme and I just want to thank

This isn't working.

300
00:16:22,868 --> 00:16:26,079
I'm getting punchy.

301
00:16:26,163 --> 00:16:28,916
All I can think of when I
think of hemorrhoids is I

302
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:31,293
don't want to thinkabout hemorrhoids.

303
00:16:31,418 --> 00:16:37,175
Yeah, painful, itchingand swelling...

304
00:16:37,257 --> 00:16:40,178
Yeah, that's not helping.

305
00:16:40,886 --> 00:16:42,180
You know what we need to do?

306
00:16:45,974 --> 00:16:49,020
I'm too tired.

307
00:16:49,103 --> 00:16:51,856
It'll make us feel better.

308
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,441
All right.

309
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:02,909
And a 5, 6, 7, 8...

310
00:17:20,051 --> 00:17:23,471
Bet you Fred Astairenever had hemorrhoids.

311
00:17:23,554 --> 00:17:28,268
No, he wore a tux, he didn't use them.

312
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:30,895
Wait a minute; Classyguy, hitting the road.

313
00:17:30,979 --> 00:17:33,231
Tux jacket swungover his shoulder,

314
00:17:33,314 --> 00:17:36,485
nothing holding himback, he's suave,

315
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:37,652
he's debonair...

316
00:17:37,777 --> 00:17:38,778
Have tux, will travel.

317
00:17:38,862 --> 00:17:39,863

00:17:41,155 --> 00:17:43,908
Okay.

320
00:17:46,494 --> 00:17:47,579
What time is it?

321
00:17:47,663 --> 00:17:48,955
Late.

322
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:50,958
It's weird, I haven'theard from Jane.

323
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,625
She's probably asleep.

324
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,753
No, she said shewas going to call.

325
00:17:58,716 --> 00:18:02,344
Hi, you've reached George; I
can't take your call right now.

326
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:04,138
Hi baby, it's me.

327
00:18:04,221 --> 00:18:07,098
You're not here and I've
just been thinking about you

328
00:18:07,181 --> 00:18:09,143
and thinking about you.

329
00:18:09,226 --> 00:18:12,187
I can't stop thinking about you.

330
00:18:14,481 --> 00:18:18,526
I can't do this George.

331
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:19,695
It's just too hard.

332
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,073
I want to do it but I can't.

333
00:18:23,198 --> 00:18:24,950
I know it's not right to
leave this on your machine,

334
00:18:25,034 --> 00:18:28,662
but I couldn't bring
myself to say it in person.

335
00:18:28,746 --> 00:18:29,913
Oh my god.

336
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:31,415
I'm messed up baby.

337
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,959
You know it and I know it.

338
00:18:34,043 --> 00:18:41,467
If I can't marry you I'd have to be...

339
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:45,304
I'm going to go away for a little bit.

340
00:18:45,387 --> 00:18:48,140
I love you I really do.

341
00:18:51,602 --> 00:18:54,563
What?

342
00:18:54,688 --> 00:18:57,400
Jane's got cold feet.

343
00:18:57,525 --> 00:19:00,736
I'm going over there.

344
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:03,864
I'll be back, I'll be back.

345
00:19:04,615 --> 00:19:06,408
I'll be here.

346
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,796
Oh come on, come on.

347
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:33,228
I wish I met Janebefore she was married.

348
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:44,572

oneach other we were falling

529
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:25,641
madly in love.

530
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:28,310

very strong feeling when
Iwalked in that this is where

Jane I know we've only
knowneach other for a few hours

598
00:31:22,986 --> 00:31:24,321

599
00:31:24,404 --> 00:31:25,864
drop Doug and marry me.

600
00:31:26,574 --> 00:31:29,118
Sure, I'll give the guy I'vebeen
mad about since college

601
00:31:29,202 --> 00:31:32,996
to marry you, an
overgrowncirculation engineer.

602
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,706
Jane I'm not going tobeat around the bush.

603
00:31:34,832 --> 00:31:36,667
I've come from the
futurewhere we're in love so we

604
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:38,418
can fall in lovein the past.

605
00:31:38,502 --> 00:31:40,045
You must marry me.

606
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:43,842
That'll work.

607
00:31:45,134 --> 00:31:48,221
Jane, marry me before I have aheart attack.

608
00:31:48,346 --> 00:31:49,848
Yeah, I alwaysfound the sympathy

609
00:31:49,973 --> 00:31:51,265
approach works best too.

610
00:31:51,348 --> 00:31:52,517
Harvey, what are you doing here?

611
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,934

After what the big
guysaw of you this morning,

00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,566
he won't take nofor an answer.

615
00:31:59,691 --> 00:32:00,941
Harvey, that was a mistake.

616
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,068
I didn't mean to do that.

617
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,945
What are you talking
about? Your ideas were great.

618
00:32:04,028 --> 00:32:05,237
Well that's thething Harvey,

619
00:32:05,363 --> 00:32:06,489
they weren't my ideas.

620
00:32:06,573 --> 00:32:08,490
They were a whole bunchof other peoples'.

621
00:32:08,574 --> 00:32:10,201
I don't like it whenthe crazy talk starts.

622
00:32:10,284 --> 00:32:11,703
Harvey you shouldshow him your ideas;

623
00:32:11,786 --> 00:32:13,829
Your ideas are great.

624
00:32:13,912 --> 00:32:16,249
How would you know?

625
00:32:16,373 --> 00:32:20,128
Crazy people know things.

626
00:32:23,673 --> 00:32:31,514
Look, if you change
yourmind call me any time.

627
00:32:31,598 --> 00:32:34,683
Don't you ever move?

628
00:32:39,522 --> 00:32:41,608
I love writingmy own horoscope.

629
00:32:41,733 --> 00:32:46,988
All Pisces will be lucky in
loveand will make beautiful brides.

630
00:32:47,071 --> 00:32:49,490

now, let me do it.

631
00:32:49,574 --> 00:32:51,534
Listen to this one.

632
00:32:51,618 --> 00:32:56,290
Don't make any life
changingdecisions this month and if

633
00:32:56,415 --> 00:32:58,583

634
00:32:58,666 --> 00:32:59,835
It's all wrong for you.

635
00:32:59,918 --> 00:33:01,252
Look around the corner.

636
00:33:01,336 --> 00:33:04,631
Something wonderfulis about to come.

637
00:33:04,756 --> 00:33:07,258
Hey, I'm back.

638
00:33:07,342 --> 00:33:12,222

639
00:33:12,305 --> 00:33:14,390
Yeah, thosepapers are heavy.

640
00:33:14,475 --> 00:33:16,435
So George, sit down
andhave some pizza with us.

641
00:33:16,517 --> 00:33:18,519

Thanks.

645
00:33:22,649 --> 00:33:24,777
All right, so that's
itfor horoscopes, right?

646
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,612
On to predictions.

647
00:33:26,737 --> 00:33:28,905
Okay, I did one of those too and I'm done.

648
00:33:28,988 --> 00:33:29,949
Do you want to hear it? Mhm.

649
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:34,411
Okay, I predict and
myangel guide assures me,

650
00:33:34,495 --> 00:33:37,580
in the spirit of inclusionand
enlightenment that our

651
00:33:37,664 --> 00:33:44,380
next president willdefinitely be a woman.

652
00:33:44,462 --> 00:33:47,383
It's her 10% success rate
thatgives her such confidence.

653
00:33:47,466 --> 00:33:50,551
Pay no attention toher, I am very accurate.

654
00:33:50,635 --> 00:33:52,221
I've got one.

655
00:33:52,303 --> 00:33:54,974
Okay... I predict...

656
00:33:56,976 --> 00:33:58,435
Do you want to try one?

657
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:01,063
It's not like there
areany rules or anything.

658
00:34:01,146 --> 00:34:04,775
Uh, I don't think I'dbe any good at it.

659
00:34:04,858 --> 00:34:07,987
George, George, if you want
tobe in the newspaper business

660
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:10,906
you have to take
assignmentsthat are given to you.

661
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:13,075
Come on, try one.

662
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,994
Just make it up.

663
00:34:15,077 --> 00:34:22,752
Okay, how about Paris
Hiltondoes time in the big house.

664
00:34:22,835 --> 00:34:27,339
Sorry, how about Martha
Stewartdoes time in the big house.

665
00:34:27,464 --> 00:34:29,842
We're not theNational Enquirer,

666
00:34:29,925 --> 00:34:31,386
I have to beable to print it.

667
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,555
It's just... it has tobe
somewhat realistic.

668
00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:36,348
You want to try again?

669
00:34:36,433 --> 00:34:39,185
Okay, let's see.

Governor of CA.

671
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:46,192
He doesn't get it.

672
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:47,318
Yeah, it's allright. It's all right.

673
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:48,820
You know what; I
shouldreally get going anyway.

Half day tomorrowand then you're gone?

680
00:35:00,123 --> 00:35:03,792

685
00:35:15,305 --> 00:35:18,308
George, you just need to
gohome and soak in a hot tub.

686
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:20,226
You look exhausted.

687
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:23,229

No, I don't think so.

717
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,601
Your face isdefinitely an original.

718
00:36:42,685 --> 00:36:47,898
In fact I've never
seenanother quite like it.

719
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:53,195
Oh, hurry, there's
alight, you gotta make it.

720
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,530
Sorry.

721
00:36:54,655 --> 00:36:56,448
Two tickets last year.

722
00:36:56,532 --> 00:37:00,494
Oh George, before I forget,
I'll give you my spare key.

723
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:03,664
It's going to be upstairs,
#4 at the end of the hall.

724
00:37:03,747 --> 00:37:07,251
Are you going tocome up or...?

725
00:37:07,334 --> 00:37:08,544
Oh no, no, I can't.

726
00:37:08,669 --> 00:37:09,795
I've got to meet Doug.

727
00:37:10,172 --> 00:37:15,676
Oh, well thank you, you've
beenas kind as I thought you'd be.

728
00:37:15,759 --> 00:37:16,760
Oh no worries.

729
00:37:16,844 --> 00:37:18,345
Just make yourself at home.

730
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,306
Take a hot bath, get some sleep.

731
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:21,849
Oh and help yourself
toanything in the kitchen.

732
00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:24,811
Just check theexpiration dates.

733
00:37:24,895 --> 00:37:26,061
I know.

734
00:37:26,187 --> 00:37:27,355
What?

735
00:37:27,439 --> 00:37:30,817
I will.

736
00:38:09,814 --> 00:38:12,317
Not this time around.

737
00:38:16,696 --> 00:38:21,326
So, Doug sent me my very,
veryfavorite flowers in the world.

738
00:38:21,409 --> 00:38:23,536
Now what do you have
tosay for yourself huh?

739
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:28,875
I say they are beautiful and
I say they're not from Doug.

740
00:38:28,959 --> 00:38:30,794
Of course they are;
Whoelse would they be from?

741
00:38:30,919 --> 00:38:34,297
Morning Jane.

742
00:38:34,422 --> 00:38:36,549
Him?

743
00:38:36,633 --> 00:38:39,427
Wait, you bought me flowers?

744
00:38:39,553 --> 00:38:41,263
Oh, I just wanted to thank
you for letting me stay at

745
00:38:41,388 --> 00:38:43,391
your place last night.

746
00:38:43,474 --> 00:38:46,268
Did she tell you I love Calla lilies?

747
00:38:46,393 --> 00:38:48,019
Not guilty.

748
00:38:48,103 --> 00:38:49,688
I love them too. I couldn't resist.

749
00:38:49,771 --> 00:38:51,523
Aren't they themost beautiful?

750
00:38:51,606 --> 00:38:53,901
Thank you.

751
00:38:53,984 --> 00:38:55,735

752
00:38:55,819 --> 00:38:57,405
Oh yeah, what have you got?

753
00:38:57,487 --> 00:39:01,866
Oh my god, I love
thesechocolate twisty things!

754
00:39:05,705 --> 00:39:07,956
These happen to be one
of my favorite danishes too.

755
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:10,876
Coincidence.

756
00:39:13,004 --> 00:39:14,297
Hey, did Doug call?

757
00:39:14,422 --> 00:39:15,464
No.

758
00:39:15,548 --> 00:39:17,216
Not that I know of.

759
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,301
I have so much todo I'm freaking out.

760
00:39:19,384 --> 00:39:20,595
Like what?

761
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,846
Like I'm getting married
onSaturday and we haven't even

762
00:39:22,972 --> 00:39:24,598
got any gifts for the wedding party.

763
00:39:24,682 --> 00:39:26,851
It's just... as soon as
hecalls we're going to go

764
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,311

765
00:39:28,394 --> 00:39:30,645
Got you coffee too.

766
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,815
Oh you know what; I'm
reallypicky about my coffee, sorry.

767
00:39:32,898 --> 00:39:35,151
It's double espresso,
whole milk, three sugars?

768
00:39:35,234 --> 00:39:38,904
I hope that's okay?

769
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,039
Don't you people listento anything I say?

770
00:39:48,164 --> 00:39:50,291

hoursto come up with something

771
00:39:50,374 --> 00:39:51,917

772
00:39:52,001 --> 00:39:54,337
Anything that doesn'tbelong in a shredder!

773
00:39:54,462 --> 00:39:56,380

774
00:39:59,259 --> 00:40:00,343

00:40:00,426 --> 00:40:01,928
Well, where is he?

776
00:40:02,011 --> 00:40:04,180
Well Mr. Johnson, Itried, I really did.

777
00:40:04,305 --> 00:40:06,975
Can't anybody do anythingright around here?

778
00:40:07,059 --> 00:40:10,686
Actually I know this may
bea bit out of the ordinary, but

779
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:14,149
I was thinking I might havesome
sketches you might like.

780
00:40:14,231 --> 00:40:16,233
Looking to get out of the mailroom are we?

781
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:18,027

00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,036
out of the mailroompermanently.

785
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:28,496
Understand?

786
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,998
Then why are you still here?

787
00:40:32,376 --> 00:40:33,710
Hey, where are you going?

788
00:40:33,835 --> 00:40:34,878

789
00:40:35,086 --> 00:40:36,962
Aw, I'm on some
specialassignment for Johnson

790
00:40:37,046 --> 00:40:38,131
he's such a jerk.

791

Well you want me to
makeyour deliveries for you?

792
00:40:40,341 --> 00:40:41,217
You're kidding? Really?

793
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,135
Yeah, sure, it's no problem.

794
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,305
Don't worry about a thing.

795
00:41:06,993 --> 00:41:09,454
You Don't ThrowAway, can I help you?

796
00:41:09,579 --> 00:41:13,125
Yeah, let me talk to Jane, it's Doug.

797
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:16,211
Um, she's nothere right now.

798
00:41:16,294 --> 00:41:17,421
Can I take a message.

799
00:41:17,587 --> 00:41:20,841
Yeah, it's Doug, tell her
I'm ready to meet her.

800
00:41:20,924 --> 00:41:28,224
Bad... can't... can't... hear...

801
00:41:28,306 --> 00:41:30,685
What... hello?

802
00:41:30,768 --> 00:41:32,811
Hello?

803
00:41:38,735 --> 00:41:40,026
They're beautiful.

804
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,653
I know, aren't they?

805
00:41:41,778 --> 00:41:44,448
So sweet of himto bring them.

806
00:41:44,532 --> 00:41:47,659
That's why he's here,
tobring you flowers and Danish

807
00:41:47,784 --> 00:41:49,619
and the perfectcup of coffee.

808
00:41:49,704 --> 00:41:52,831
He's here because he's
abit of an eccentric and he

809
00:41:52,956 --> 00:41:56,376
doesn't seem to mindbeing
grossly underpaid.

810
00:42:02,466 --> 00:42:04,176
Don't Throw Away, can I help you?

811
00:42:04,301 --> 00:42:05,470
Yeah, you can... I want to speak...

812
00:42:05,595 --> 00:42:08,639
Hello... hello...

813
00:42:08,723 --> 00:42:10,433
I said tell Jane that...

814
00:42:10,516 --> 00:42:16,856
Can't hear you, call back.

815
00:42:16,981 --> 00:42:19,525
That was Doug, it was
areally bad connection but I

816
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,862
think he said that he
wascompletely unavailable and

817
00:42:22,987 --> 00:42:25,490
that you should go
onwithout him and then his

818
00:42:25,615 --> 00:42:26,740
phone completely died.

819
00:42:26,908 --> 00:42:30,119
Oh no, I've no idea what
I'mgoing to get for these

820
00:42:30,203 --> 00:42:32,580
usher gifts.

821
00:42:32,663 --> 00:42:34,332
I could help you; I'vebeen an usher before.

822
00:42:34,415 --> 00:42:35,958
I know what ushers like.

823
00:42:36,042 --> 00:42:40,631
Yeah, you can go and I
willstay here ad man the phone.

824
00:42:40,713 --> 00:42:41,756
Really, would you?

825
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,549
Oh you guys, thatwould be great.

826
00:42:43,674 --> 00:42:44,675
That would be so great.

827
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:47,513
I'm going to get an
advancefrom petty cash for you so

828
00:42:47,596 --> 00:42:50,057
that while you're
outshopping maybe you could

829
00:42:50,182 --> 00:42:52,600
stop at the men'sdepartment and...

830
00:42:52,684 --> 00:42:54,018
Buy something new.

831
00:42:54,143 --> 00:42:56,271

836
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,685

Oh, okay.

839
00:43:44,736 --> 00:43:48,407
It's perfect.

840
00:43:48,532 --> 00:43:50,617
I'll take three.

841
00:43:50,742 --> 00:43:51,743
Do you wrap them?

842
00:43:51,868 --> 00:43:52,703

He thinks he's gong to

894
00:45:30,176 --> 00:45:32,011
blaming it all on you.

895
00:45:32,136 --> 00:45:33,263
What? Yeah.

896
00:45:33,346 --> 00:45:34,847
Well what do I do?

897
00:45:34,973 --> 00:45:35,849
Get the heck out of here.

898
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,016
Don't show your faceagain until tomorrow.

899
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,270
Go, I'll cover for you.

900
00:45:45,566 --> 00:45:46,734
They were rightwhere I left them.

901
00:45:46,859 --> 00:45:47,777
You didn't tell anybodyl was here right?

902
00:45:47,986 --> 00:45:49,445
No, I did just what you told me to.

903
00:45:49,529 --> 00:45:52,282
Good.

904
00:45:56,035 --> 00:45:57,454
These are um...

905
00:45:57,538 --> 00:45:58,580
Awful.

906
00:45:58,705 --> 00:46:00,373
Really, I knowif you were...

907
00:46:00,498 --> 00:46:01,667
Oh my god!

908
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:05,712
No, these aren't mysketches... oh no, no,

909
00:46:05,795 --> 00:46:06,754
these aren't mine.

910
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,048
I would never draw these.

911
00:46:08,173 --> 00:46:11,050
Oh...

912
00:46:11,134 --> 00:46:13,887
That's why Jack was
soanxious to get rid of me.

913
00:46:14,013 --> 00:46:15,346
He switched them.

914
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:17,391
How did you know?

915
00:46:17,516 --> 00:46:19,810
Cause I know that creep
froma long time ago and he's

916
00:46:19,893 --> 00:46:21,895
finally about to get his.

917
00:46:46,462 --> 00:46:47,713
Oh, sorry.

918
00:46:47,796 --> 00:46:49,965
Sorry, what a klutz I am.

919
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:50,842
You okay?

920
00:46:50,966 --> 00:46:52,676
Oh yeah, thank you. You're welcome.

921
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,219
Thanks a lot.

922
00:46:54,304 --> 00:46:55,387
No problem.

923
00:47:06,732 --> 00:47:08,234
Is Harvey Blinten back?

924
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:09,443
No sir.

925
00:47:09,568 --> 00:47:10,737
Three martini lunch.

926
00:47:10,945 --> 00:47:12,821
Yeah, I hate to say it but I
think he may be in need of

927
00:47:12,946 --> 00:47:16,951
your very generousemployee rehab program.

928
00:47:17,619 --> 00:47:19,244
In that case I guessthis is your lucky day.

929
00:47:19,329 --> 00:47:21,372

930
00:47:33,634 --> 00:47:34,593

I insist.

933
00:47:37,055 --> 00:47:38,306
No, please.

934
00:48:02,163 --> 00:48:03,957
That was some firstrate work boys.

935
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,625

945
00:48:35,281 --> 00:48:38,658

Oh honey, don't scold
themfor the things they do right.

958
00:49:11,191 --> 00:49:13,067

You're welcome.

00:50:02,494 --> 00:50:04,536
Does this mean I'min the wedding now?

975
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,206
No.

976
00:50:06,288 --> 00:50:07,916
It was just when we foundthem
for the ushers you said

977
00:50:07,998 --> 00:50:11,461
you always wanted one, so...

978
00:50:12,796 --> 00:50:15,674
That's really sweet.

979
00:50:16,466 --> 00:50:17,758
Thanks.

980
00:50:17,841 --> 00:50:20,971
So George, you can't
reallyturn down that advertising

981
00:50:21,053 --> 00:50:22,305
job can you?

982
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:23,722
Yes.

983
00:50:23,806 --> 00:50:24,848
Seriously?

984
00:50:24,975 --> 00:50:26,226
To deliver papers?

985
00:50:26,308 --> 00:50:28,812
Well maybe I'llget a promotion.

986
00:50:28,936 --> 00:50:32,023
Maybe you'll becomethe next Dear Abby.

987
00:50:32,148 --> 00:50:33,817
Sounds good to me.

988
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,152
Although right now I wish I
was a little more Elizabeth

989
00:50:36,277 --> 00:50:38,612
Barrett Browning, but...

990
00:50:38,697 --> 00:50:40,239
Why is that?

991
00:50:40,322 --> 00:50:45,704
Well sort of trying to writeDoug
a poem for the ceremony

992
00:50:45,829 --> 00:50:48,415
and it's not going well.

993
00:50:48,498 --> 00:50:51,793
Turns out it's a lot
harderthan one would think.

994
00:50:51,876 --> 00:50:53,837
You know he's not going
tolike it if its too romantic

995
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,380
or mushy or...

996
00:50:55,505 --> 00:50:58,174
Well maybe I could help.

997
00:50:58,258 --> 00:50:59,467
Really?

998
00:50:59,551 --> 00:51:02,345
Okay, go ahead.

999
00:51:02,429 --> 00:51:05,516
Something not too mushyfor
an unromantic groom.

1000
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,891
Okay, I didn't say that.

1001
00:51:07,017 --> 00:51:11,229
Just you know, not too much...

1002
00:51:11,354 --> 00:51:15,191
Roses are red, violets are blue,

1003
00:51:15,275 --> 00:51:21,531
I hadn't met my soul
matewhen I said I'd marry you.

1004
00:51:21,656 --> 00:51:23,241
Maybe a littlemushier than that.

1005
00:51:23,366 --> 00:51:24,452
More mushy?

1006
00:51:24,535 --> 00:51:29,080
Yeah a little bit.

1007
00:51:29,205 --> 00:51:34,669
Well it may not beverse but here goes.

1008
00:51:34,753 --> 00:51:39,049
If I was marrying the womanof
my dreams on Saturday,

1009
00:51:39,175 --> 00:51:43,303
I would tell her that she
isthe only woman in the world

1010
00:51:43,386 --> 00:51:46,806
with whom I could spendthe rest of my life.

1011
00:51:46,891 --> 00:51:50,935
And that once I found
herewe'd really have no choice

1012
00:51:51,061 --> 00:51:55,941
but to be together no matterthe place...

1013
00:51:56,067 --> 00:51:59,904
no matter the time...

1014
00:51:59,987 --> 00:52:02,656
Lucky girl.

1015
00:52:03,574 --> 00:52:06,077
With Mary Anne boy,
shehad a lot to say huh?

1016
00:52:06,202 --> 00:52:08,788
She is a talker.

1017
00:52:08,913 --> 00:52:10,163
I can't find the light.

1018
00:52:10,247 --> 00:52:11,290
It's right here.

1019
00:52:11,415 --> 00:52:12,625
Oh, right there.

1020
00:52:12,749 --> 00:52:14,919
Doug, what are you doing here?

1021
00:52:15,044 --> 00:52:16,670
Waiting for you.

1022
00:52:16,754 --> 00:52:18,130
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1023
00:52:18,255 --> 00:52:19,757
Have you been here long?

1024
00:52:19,882 --> 00:52:21,342
Long enough.

1025
00:52:21,425 --> 00:52:25,429
Well don't be mad, we were
just... we found great gifts

1026
00:52:25,554 --> 00:52:26,598
for the wedding party.

1027
00:52:26,889 --> 00:52:29,600
We got these great
necklacesfor the bridesmaids and

1028
00:52:29,725 --> 00:52:32,812
these utility knivesfor the ushers...

1029
00:52:32,937 --> 00:52:33,979
We?

1030
00:52:34,105 --> 00:52:40,736
Yeah, I went with George,
George from the office.

1031
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:42,780
We should get going
anywayto your place, right babe.

1032
00:52:42,863 --> 00:52:47,034
I mean we have to finalizethe
seating chart and all that.

1033
00:52:47,118 --> 00:52:49,829
Let's get some dinnerfirst, I am starving.

1034
00:52:49,955 --> 00:52:51,122
Oh, me too.

1035
00:52:51,247 --> 00:52:52,957

1036
00:52:53,082 --> 00:52:55,626
Well thank you Georgefor all the help.

1037
00:52:55,751 --> 00:52:57,211
No problem.

1038
00:52:57,294 --> 00:53:03,135
And you know, don't
worryabout work; You'll be fine.

1039
00:53:03,259 --> 00:53:06,304
Thanks Jane, you'vebeen nothing but kind.

1040
00:53:06,429 --> 00:53:07,680
We should be going.

1041
00:53:07,805 --> 00:53:08,848
Yes, we should.

1042
00:53:08,974 --> 00:53:10,809
Good bye.

1043
00:53:10,892 --> 00:53:14,521
Bye Jane.

1044
00:53:20,485 --> 00:53:23,530
We've got our eyes on you.

1045
00:53:58,857 --> 00:54:00,150
George, are you in there?

1046
00:54:00,233 --> 00:54:01,193
Yeah.

1047
00:54:01,276 --> 00:54:02,235
It's me Jane.

1048
00:54:02,361 --> 00:54:04,571
Hold on.

1049
00:54:06,364 --> 00:54:07,617
What's going on? What happened?

1050
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,368
Sorry. Oh sorry.

1051
00:54:09,452 --> 00:54:11,204
I feel so stupidcoming here like this.

1052
00:54:11,328 --> 00:54:13,163
Don't be silly, its your apartment.

1053
00:54:13,246 --> 00:54:15,374
I just... I didn't know
whereto go and I was driving

1054
00:54:15,499 --> 00:54:18,460
around and it just made mefeel worse so

1055
00:54:18,543 --> 00:54:21,922
...Sit, sit, sit.

1056
00:54:22,881 --> 00:54:23,757
Thank you.

1057
00:54:23,882 --> 00:54:25,051
Want some water?

1058
00:54:25,134 --> 00:54:26,886
Wine please.

1059
00:54:26,968 --> 00:54:30,973
In one of the biggerglasses please.

1060
00:54:31,057 --> 00:54:35,311
I'm sorry, this isso embarrassing.

1061
00:54:35,394 --> 00:54:36,603
What's going on?

1062
00:54:36,728 --> 00:54:42,692
Um... just Doug and I
arefighting about everything.

1063
00:54:43,903 --> 00:54:46,072
Like what?

1064
00:54:46,154 --> 00:54:49,741
Um... like my lettingyou stay here.

1065
00:54:49,824 --> 00:54:53,119
He said you're trying
to take advantage of me.

1066
00:54:53,245 --> 00:54:54,413
What did you say?

1067
00:54:54,539 --> 00:54:55,581
Nothing.

1068
00:54:55,747 --> 00:54:58,709
I wanted to defend you
but I just... I just thought it

1069
00:54:58,793 --> 00:55:02,546
would be easier to letit
blow over, you know.

1070
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:06,509
To my assertive training...

1071
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:12,598
And then in the middle
ofeverything he got beeped and

1072
00:55:12,723 --> 00:55:15,059
had to go back to work.

1073
00:55:15,142 --> 00:55:19,146
Do you believe him?

1074
00:55:19,272 --> 00:55:20,815
Sort of, I don't now.

1075
00:55:20,941 --> 00:55:23,276
I mean... I want to believe him.

1076
00:55:23,401 --> 00:55:24,777
I'm just such anidiot, you know.

1077
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:29,533
I always end up
apologizinganyway after we fight.

1078
00:55:29,616 --> 00:55:31,492
Can I have somemore wine please?

1079
00:55:31,617 --> 00:55:34,955
Sure thing Janie.

1080
00:55:35,079 --> 00:55:40,127
Nobody calls meJanie anymore.

1081
00:55:40,209 --> 00:55:43,672
I like it.

1082
00:55:48,593 --> 00:55:50,387
There you go Janie.

1083
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:52,597
What is it with you?

1084
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,348
Where did you come from?

1085
00:55:54,473 --> 00:55:57,643
I've never metanyone like you.

1086
00:55:57,727 --> 00:55:58,728
It's just me.

1087
00:55:58,811 --> 00:56:00,479
Okay, see thatdoesn't mean anything.

1088
00:56:00,563 --> 00:56:03,149
I want to know whatyou're story is.

1089
00:56:03,275 --> 00:56:06,820
I mean, smart, funny,
greatlooking guy just waltzes

1090
00:56:06,945 --> 00:56:08,822
into town with theshirt on his back?

1091
00:56:08,905 --> 00:56:10,031
Where did you come from?

1092
00:56:10,198 --> 00:56:14,786
I'm a lost soul travelingthrough
time trying to pick

1093
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:17,122
up the pieces of my shattered life.

1094
00:56:17,205 --> 00:56:20,500
Oh god, please, noneof this New Age crap,

1095
00:56:20,625 --> 00:56:21,835
I get enough of that from Mary.

1096
00:56:22,002 --> 00:56:26,631
Please tell me in concrete,
earth bound terms ...what

1097
00:56:26,715 --> 00:56:27,716
are you doing here?

1098
00:56:27,841 --> 00:56:30,927
I got my heart brokeand I skipped town.

1099
00:56:31,011 --> 00:56:32,512
Really?

1100
00:56:32,638 --> 00:56:37,934
I lost the woman I wanted
tospend the rest of my life with.

1101
00:56:38,018 --> 00:56:43,357
What happened?

1102
00:56:43,482 --> 00:56:45,817
After her first marriage
toa guy that was completely

1103
00:56:45,901 --> 00:56:50,782
wrong for her, she wasscared
to death to do it again.

1104
00:56:50,864 --> 00:56:55,995
But I was so sure about
us Iconvinced her she had to

1105
00:56:56,078 --> 00:56:58,205
be my wife.

1106
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:00,375
But while I was
offcelebrating our engagement

1107
00:57:00,499 --> 00:57:06,422
she was sinking into a
holel didn't know existed.

1108
00:57:06,546 --> 00:57:09,341
Then one day she was gone.

1109
00:57:11,343 --> 00:57:14,931
What was she like?

1110
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:20,395
Beautiful, smart, funny, a little nutty.

1111
00:57:23,397 --> 00:57:26,401
No one every made mefeel the way she did.

1112
00:57:28,861 --> 00:57:30,780
That's so sad.

1113
00:57:34,992 --> 00:57:37,953
She broke my heart.

1114
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:45,461
You're too sweet tohave your heart broken.

1115
00:57:45,586 --> 00:57:49,173
Feeling a little better now.

1116
00:57:49,256 --> 00:57:52,260
Maybe you'll fallin love again.

1117
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,220
I think so.

1118
00:57:54,303 --> 00:57:56,764
Mm, you're a romantic.

1119
00:57:56,848 --> 00:58:01,185
I like that.

1120
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:03,521
Night George.

1121
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:20,288
Baby I just had themost vivid dream.

1122
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:24,542
Weird too.

1123
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,179
Oh... hello?

1124
00:58:35,304 --> 00:58:37,513

1125
00:58:37,638 --> 00:58:44,146
Oh, no, no, I just woke up.

1126
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,732
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

1127
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:51,444
I just... I had a few glassesof
wine last night and just

1128
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:55,157
fell asleep.

1129
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:59,202
Um, he went to a hotel.

1130
00:58:59,328 --> 00:59:01,038
You are?

1131
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:06,627
No, I'm just surprisedto hear you say that.

1132
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,669
Well I'm sorry too.

1133
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:10,130
I'm so sorry.

1134
00:59:10,214 --> 00:59:12,466
I really should have
juststayed there and waited for

1135
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,218

1136
00:59:14,343 --> 00:59:16,178
I overreacted.

1137
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,596
I think I havethe jitters too.

1138
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,806
I can't believeit's tomorrow.

1139
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:24,228
Okay, well I'll just see youat
the rehearsal at 4:00 then.

1140
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:28,232

He said he had to
worklate and ...I believe him.

1154
01:00:06,688 --> 01:00:08,105
Why do you believe him?

1155
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:09,106
Because.

1156
01:00:09,399 --> 01:00:12,026
Because we've been
togethera really long time.

1157
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:13,111
What does that matter?

1158
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,903
You weren't so willing
tobelieve everything last night.

1159
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,072
Forget about last night.

1160
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:19,158

01:00:31,963 --> 01:00:33,423
You're not in love with him.

1168
01:00:33,548 --> 01:00:37,385
George, I really gotta go.

1169
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:45,268
George?

1170
01:00:45,351 --> 01:00:47,437

1171
01:00:53,443 --> 01:00:58,489
The Don't ThrowAway, Mary speaking.

1172
01:00:58,615 --> 01:01:00,241
Hello?

1173
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:04,078

1174
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:11,794
Uh, George, whenthe phone rings,

1175
01:01:11,878 --> 01:01:16,049

1176
01:01:16,132 --> 01:01:17,884
I'm sorry, wasthe phone ringing?

1177
01:01:17,967 --> 01:01:22,305
Yeah, it was.

1178
01:01:22,388 --> 01:01:24,849
Are you okay?

1179
01:01:26,018 --> 01:01:32,815
Uh... I can't stopthinking about Jane.

1180
01:01:32,941 --> 01:01:35,985
Oh... I knew it!

1181
01:01:36,069 --> 01:01:37,153
Is it that obvious?

1182
01:01:37,446 --> 01:01:42,951
Well you see with my
psychicabilities I could tell from

1183
01:01:43,034 --> 01:01:45,787
the beginning that
youwere deeply connected.

1184
01:01:45,871 --> 01:01:48,165
In fact, I would say that
you probably loved each

1185
01:01:48,289 --> 01:01:51,210
other very muchin a past life.

1186
01:01:51,335 --> 01:01:53,754
Future.

1187
01:01:53,837 --> 01:01:55,756
Future?

1188
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,175
We love each otherin a future life.

1189
01:01:58,300 --> 01:01:59,509
Future lives?

1190
01:01:59,635 --> 01:02:00,511
Yeah.

1191
01:02:00,636 --> 01:02:02,596
Why don't I knowabout these?

1192
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,014
Sit down Mary, you'regoing to be the first

1193
01:02:04,098 --> 01:02:06,684
to hear all about it.

1194
01:02:07,643 --> 01:02:11,563
I knew that you
weredestined to be together...

1195
01:02:11,689 --> 01:02:15,484
in the past I had
doubtsabout my predictions,

1196
01:02:15,567 --> 01:02:16,860
but not any more.

1197
01:02:16,986 --> 01:02:18,028
This is proof.

1198
01:02:18,112 --> 01:02:19,531
I can tell the future.

1199
01:02:19,655 --> 01:02:21,532
Well you were rightabout Doug too.

1200
01:02:21,615 --> 01:02:23,367
Today when he's supposed
tobe at the wedding rehearsal

1201
01:02:23,492 --> 01:02:25,662
he's actually upstairs in the
honeymoon suite messing

1202
01:02:25,744 --> 01:02:27,579
around with thewedding coordinator.

1203
01:02:27,705 --> 01:02:31,375
Oh, I was rightabout him too?

1204
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,460
Oh, but that's awful.

1205
01:02:32,751 --> 01:02:34,254
You know Jane said
shewished somebody would have

1206
01:02:34,379 --> 01:02:38,215
taken her upstairs and
shownhere who Doug really was

1207
01:02:38,298 --> 01:02:40,218
before she got married.

1208
01:02:40,343 --> 01:02:41,219
Why don't you?

1209
01:02:41,344 --> 01:02:42,594
Well I don't want to break her heart.

1210
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,096
There's got tobe an easier way.

1211
01:02:44,221 --> 01:02:46,932
Well does she know howyou feel about her?

1212
01:02:47,057 --> 01:02:49,435
She couldn't miss it.

1213
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,688
Did you tell her?

1214
01:02:51,771 --> 01:02:55,233
I didn't tell herright out exactly.

1215
01:02:55,357 --> 01:03:00,571
She's do for a final fittingat
Westwood Bridal now.

1216
01:03:00,696 --> 01:03:03,074
All right, I'm going to tell
herexactly how I feel about her.

1217
01:03:03,198 --> 01:03:04,492
Yes.

1218
01:03:05,909 --> 01:03:07,745
You know what; If
thewedding's not cancelled by

1219
01:03:07,871 --> 01:03:10,081
4:00 this afternoon,
youcould be my date to the

1220
01:03:10,164 --> 01:03:11,541
rehearsal dinnertonight, okay.

1221
01:03:11,624 --> 01:03:14,711
And then together we
couldtake Jane up to the bridal

1222
01:03:14,794 --> 01:03:17,088
suite and show her thatDoug started the

1223
01:03:17,171 --> 01:03:18,757
honeymoon without her.

1224
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,550
I mean it'll sting, but it'snot
going to sting as much

1225
01:03:21,634 --> 01:03:23,553
as if she married that jerk.

1226
01:03:23,636 --> 01:03:24,596
Love will prevail.

1227
01:03:24,721 --> 01:03:25,597
It has to.

1228
01:03:25,888 --> 01:03:29,726
And if it doesn't,
thefuture is on your side.

1229
01:03:29,809 --> 01:03:31,644
Whew! The future!

1230
01:03:46,951 --> 01:03:48,661

1231
01:03:48,787 --> 01:03:51,164
May I come in?

1232
01:03:52,123 --> 01:03:54,125
Oh, sorry.

1233
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:56,419
Excuse us.

What are you doing here?

1235
01:04:00,633 --> 01:04:02,592
I really wanted to see you.

1236
01:04:02,675 --> 01:04:04,970
Mary told me you'd be here.

1237
01:04:05,054 --> 01:04:07,640
I'm glad you came.

1238
01:04:07,722 --> 01:04:08,598
I wanted to see you too.

1239
01:04:08,807 --> 01:04:11,184
I'm sorry I snappedat you this morning.

You look incredible.

1242
01:04:16,273 --> 01:04:17,649

Have you been practicingyour first dance?

1246
01:04:27,116 --> 01:04:29,995
Oh no, god no.

1247
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:33,457
Doug thinks its torture.

1248
01:04:33,541 --> 01:04:35,834
You could practice with me.

1249
01:04:35,918 --> 01:04:40,297
We don't have any music.

1250
01:04:56,188 --> 01:05:00,693

George... timingis everything.

It's crazy.

I don't even know you.

1268
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:09,095
You don't know me.

1269
01:06:09,221 --> 01:06:10,555
I could neverdo that to Doug.

1270
01:06:10,638 --> 01:06:11,640
Why not?

1271
01:06:11,765 --> 01:06:12,933
Why are you so loyal to him?

1272
01:06:13,016 --> 01:06:13,934
He's a liar and a cheat.

1273
01:06:14,059 --> 01:06:14,976
Okay, that's enough.

1274
01:06:15,268 --> 01:06:17,896
Please, please, youshouldn't even be here.

1275
01:06:17,979 --> 01:06:19,189
I'm sorry.

1276
01:06:19,272 --> 01:06:21,106
I didn't mean to upset you.

1277
01:06:21,232 --> 01:06:24,778
I'm just absolutely certainthat
you are making a very,

1278
01:06:24,861 --> 01:06:26,696
very bad decision.

1279
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:31,117
Look, Doug is going to be
myhusband and you are going to

1280
01:06:31,243 --> 01:06:36,456
be that really great guy I
metright before I got married.

1281
01:06:36,581 --> 01:06:39,335
Okay, so stop makingme miserable please.

1282
01:06:39,459 --> 01:06:40,669
You're miserable becauseyou know I'm right.

1283
01:06:40,877 --> 01:06:42,797
You're miserable becauseyou're
about to marry a guy who

1284
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,799
doesn't know you hate daisiesor
how you take your coffee.

1285
01:06:45,882 --> 01:06:48,010
You have to leave George.

1286
01:06:48,134 --> 01:06:49,845
This isn't the marriageyou dreamed of.

1287
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:50,845
We are.

1288
01:06:50,971 --> 01:06:51,888
George.

1289
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:52,931
I'm not going to sit by
andwatch you make a mistake.

1290
01:06:53,014 --> 01:06:53,975
You don't have to.

1291
01:06:54,058 --> 01:06:56,560
You're not invited.

1292
01:06:56,644 --> 01:06:59,188
Just go.

1293
01:07:00,189 --> 01:07:03,484
Please go.

1294
01:07:40,354 --> 01:07:43,357
I didn't realize my maid of
honor was bringing a date.

1295
01:07:43,482 --> 01:07:44,859
I'm sorry to do thisto you here, now,

1296
01:07:44,984 --> 01:07:47,403
but there's something youneed
to know about Doug and

1297
01:07:47,528 --> 01:07:49,905
it just... it can't wait.

1298
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:51,907
You just don'tgive up do you?

1299
01:07:52,033 --> 01:07:54,285
Do you even know where Doug is?

1300
01:07:54,369 --> 01:07:56,245
He's running late.

1301
01:07:56,370 --> 01:07:57,789
He'll be here any minute.

1302
01:07:57,873 --> 01:07:59,331
Jane, he's upstairs in the honeymoon suite

1303
01:07:59,415 --> 01:08:01,709
with another woman.

1304
01:08:01,792 --> 01:08:03,711
You brought him hereto tell me that?

1305
01:08:03,794 --> 01:08:07,506
Jane, Doug ischeating on you.

1306
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:08,674
I didn't want to have
totell you but you need to

1307
01:08:08,758 --> 01:08:10,551
know the truth beforeyou get married.

1308
01:08:10,676 --> 01:08:12,053
I do know the truth.

1309
01:08:12,136 --> 01:08:13,430
Prove us wrong then.

1310
01:08:13,555 --> 01:08:15,014
Let's go upstairs.

1311
01:08:15,098 --> 01:08:17,809
If you're so sure he's
notupstairs with another woman

1312
01:08:17,893 --> 01:08:19,018
then come with us.

1313
01:08:19,101 --> 01:08:21,062
I mean what could it hurt?

1314
01:08:21,188 --> 01:08:22,772
Fine. Fine.

1315
01:08:22,898 --> 01:08:27,444
You want me to go up
there, let's get it over with.

1316
01:08:31,238 --> 01:08:32,449
Now remember Janeyou're not alone.

1317
01:08:32,574 --> 01:08:34,575
We're right here with you.

1318
01:08:37,746 --> 01:08:38,871
Doug!

1319
01:08:38,954 --> 01:08:39,914
What are you doing here?

1320
01:08:40,039 --> 01:08:42,416
Honey, you'reruining the surprise.

1321
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,711
Surprise?

1322
01:08:44,795 --> 01:08:45,920
Your wedding present.

1323
01:08:46,003 --> 01:08:47,881
Oh my god, yougot me a present?

1324
01:08:47,964 --> 01:08:49,548
I didn't get you anything.

1325
01:08:49,633 --> 01:08:53,095
Oh... thank you.

1326
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:55,680
Oh look, your friendsfrom the office.

1327
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:56,973
Hey.

1328
01:08:57,099 --> 01:09:00,268
I think they were just leaving.

1329
01:09:00,352 --> 01:09:02,813
Honey, I'm so sorry
but I forgot to pick up the

1330
01:09:02,938 --> 01:09:04,773
wedding party giftsfrom your place.

1331
01:09:04,856 --> 01:09:06,149
Oh no, shoot.

1332
01:09:06,274 --> 01:09:07,734
We gotta passthose out tonight.

1333
01:09:07,818 --> 01:09:09,236
I know.

1334
01:09:09,319 --> 01:09:11,655
Oh, maybe George
herewouldn't mind running over

1335
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,281
there and gettingthem for us.

1336
01:09:13,407 --> 01:09:14,617
Me?

1337
01:09:14,699 --> 01:09:15,867
Yeah, you did pick them out.

1338
01:09:16,076 --> 01:09:17,411
I'm sure Jane would
reallyappreciate it if you could

1339
01:09:17,494 --> 01:09:19,579
do that for us.

1340
01:09:19,663 --> 01:09:21,123
Sure, whatever.

1341
01:09:21,206 --> 01:09:22,458
It's fine.

1342
01:09:22,541 --> 01:09:24,709
Thanks.

1343
01:09:31,258 --> 01:09:32,425
That was so embarrassing.

1344
01:09:32,592 --> 01:09:35,430
I don't understand whathappened
unless somehow Doug

1345
01:09:35,513 --> 01:09:37,223
knew we were coming.

1346
01:09:37,305 --> 01:09:39,516
Maybe he's from a
littlefurther into the future than

1347
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:42,018
you, huh George?

1348
01:09:44,521 --> 01:09:48,568
This is so sweet of you.

1349
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:52,822
Let's see what we got here.

1350
01:09:52,905 --> 01:09:55,324
What is this?

1351
01:09:55,408 --> 01:09:56,951
An IOU?

1352
01:09:57,034 --> 01:09:57,994
Exactly.

1353
01:09:58,119 --> 01:10:00,496
IOU the weddingpresent of your choice.

1354
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:04,041
This way you can go outand
get whatever you want.

1355
01:10:06,002 --> 01:10:07,462
Now don't worry, there'll
beplenty of time for you to

1356
01:10:07,545 --> 01:10:09,213
get me a gift too.

1357
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:10,505
Okay.

1358
01:10:10,589 --> 01:10:12,508
Well we should probablyget down there huh?

1359
01:10:12,633 --> 01:10:13,676
They're probablyready for us.

1360
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,843
Why don't you go first?

1361
01:10:15,136 --> 01:10:18,014
I should check in with
theoffice before we start, okay?

1362
01:10:18,139 --> 01:10:20,098
Okay, but don't betoo long, all right.

1363
01:10:20,182 --> 01:10:21,434
I won't.

1364
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:23,102
See you down there.

1365
01:10:35,615 --> 01:10:37,366
Yes hello, I'd liketo report a robbery.

1366
01:10:37,492 --> 01:10:39,203
My girlfriend's keys
wererecently stolen and her

1367
01:10:39,285 --> 01:10:41,370
neighbour just called
sayingsomeone suspicious was

1368
01:10:41,454 --> 01:10:42,455
trying to getinto the house.

1369
01:10:43,623 --> 01:10:45,583
Just a minute honey.

1370
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:49,462
Yes, 14083rdAve. Apartment #4.

1371
01:10:49,546 --> 01:10:50,506
Exactly.

1372
01:10:50,713 --> 01:10:53,216
Can you send a car over
there right away please?

1373
01:10:53,341 --> 01:10:55,218
Thank you.

1374
01:11:11,193 --> 01:11:12,568
How many honeymoons are youplanning to have

1375
01:11:12,652 --> 01:11:14,111
in here darling?

1376
01:11:14,237 --> 01:11:15,988
Just as many asl can get sugar.

1377
01:11:16,072 --> 01:11:17,366
We don't have time for this.

1378
01:11:17,449 --> 01:11:18,616
They're alldownstairs waiting.

1379
01:11:18,866 --> 01:11:21,077
You don't want an
uncoordinatedwedding now do you?

1380
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:25,207
I'll take my chances.

1381
01:11:39,596 --> 01:11:43,392
I know that George and
Ilook like idiots up there,

1382
01:11:43,475 --> 01:11:46,103
but I'm telling you,
Doug is up to something.

1383
01:11:46,228 --> 01:11:47,479
Where is George anyway?

1384
01:11:47,604 --> 01:11:49,273
He didn't even comeback with the gifts.

1385
01:11:49,356 --> 01:11:52,192
I know, it is kind of late.

1386
01:11:52,276 --> 01:11:54,278
Maybe he was just
tooembarrassed to come back.

1387
01:11:54,361 --> 01:11:55,696
Well he should be.

1388
01:11:55,779 --> 01:11:58,282
I mean how could you
believesomething as ridiculous as

1389
01:11:58,407 --> 01:12:00,450
Doug and the weddingcoordinator?

1390
01:12:00,575 --> 01:12:02,411
Because George told me.

1391
01:12:02,494 --> 01:12:04,454
He is very intuitive.

1392
01:12:04,579 --> 01:12:06,248
George knows things.

1393
01:12:06,331 --> 01:12:08,292
Well he certainly knows you.

1394
01:12:08,375 --> 01:12:11,295
Well he was wrongtonight wasn't he?

1395
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:13,298
Unfortunately.

1396
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:17,884
So my maid of honor
issorry that my fiancé is not

1397
01:12:17,968 --> 01:12:19,470
cheating on me.

1398
01:12:19,553 --> 01:12:20,554
You're fired.

1399
01:12:20,637 --> 01:12:21,513
Fired!

1400
01:12:21,638 --> 01:12:22,849
Oh, what a relief.

1401
01:12:22,973 --> 01:12:24,349
Now I don't haveto hold my tongue.

1402
01:12:24,475 --> 01:12:25,642
Hold your tongue?

1403
01:12:25,726 --> 01:12:27,477
Every other word out of
yourmouth is some wise crack

1404
01:12:27,561 --> 01:12:28,562
about Doug.

1405
01:12:28,896 --> 01:12:30,773
Yeah, but I never really
gotto say what I needed to say

1406
01:12:30,856 --> 01:12:34,318
because this whole maid
of honor thing tripped me up.

1407
01:12:34,401 --> 01:12:38,155
I mean but now Georgeis here and I'm fired.

1408
01:12:38,238 --> 01:12:40,449
So here goes.

1409
01:12:40,532 --> 01:12:42,994
I know what itslike to be alone.

1410
01:12:43,118 --> 01:12:47,957
I know what its like
towant someone in your life.

1411
01:12:48,041 --> 01:12:52,794
I know what its like to justtake
anyone because you just

1412
01:12:52,878 --> 01:12:55,632
can't believe that anythingbetter
is going to come along.

1413
01:12:55,715 --> 01:13:00,011
Mary, you will
findsomeone, I know you will.

1414
01:13:00,094 --> 01:13:02,013
We are not talking about me.

1415
01:13:02,096 --> 01:13:07,018
Don't settle for Doug,
especially now that you've

1416
01:13:07,101 --> 01:13:10,355
glimpsed a future in
whichthere is the kind of love

1417
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:14,776
most of us will onlydream about.

1418
01:13:19,864 --> 01:13:21,032
Doug!

1419
01:13:21,157 --> 01:13:22,033
Jane!

1420
01:13:22,282 --> 01:13:24,869
You two should be up
herepracticing for tomorrow.

1421
01:13:24,994 --> 01:13:28,373
Oh daddy, you knowDoug hates to dance, and

1422
01:13:28,456 --> 01:13:34,337
besides I already
practicedearlier at my fitting.

1423
01:13:34,421 --> 01:13:40,176
You and your dress
dancedtogether at the bridal shop?

1424
01:13:40,259 --> 01:13:45,724
No, George was there and
I was in my dress and the

1425
01:13:45,807 --> 01:13:50,770
moment just sortof took over.

01:24:01,762 --> 01:24:03,056
I think you must havereally
bumped your head

1605
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:04,306
when you fainted.

1606
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:05,642
No, I'm feeling great.

1607
01:24:05,726 --> 01:24:06,892
I'm just getting used to it.

1608
01:24:07,102 --> 01:24:11,356
I'm George Murray, we're at
the Stonehouse Inn and the

1609
01:24:11,481 --> 01:24:14,525
year is 2009...?

1610
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:16,570
Yeah.

1611
01:24:16,695 --> 01:24:17,863
Okay, all right.

1612
01:24:17,987 --> 01:24:19,531
No time like the present.

1613
01:24:21,283 --> 01:24:22,909
Jane, George...

1614
01:24:23,035 --> 01:24:23,952

1616
01:24:25,245 --> 01:24:27,330
No, I have something to say.

1617
01:24:29,499 --> 01:24:33,503
Before I met you I
didn'tthink a love like ours was

1618
01:24:33,587 --> 01:24:40,093
possible and thenthere you were.

1619
01:24:40,218 --> 01:24:43,305
You told me our love
wasreal and that it would last

1620
01:24:43,388 --> 01:24:46,975
and you were right.

1621
01:24:47,059 --> 01:24:50,270
I just want to say I havenever
loved anyone the way

1622
01:24:50,395 --> 01:24:52,314
I love you.

1623
01:24:52,397 --> 01:24:55,525
So the answer to yourquestion is, I do.

1624
01:24:55,609 --> 01:24:56,485
And now George.

1625
01:24:56,568 --> 01:24:58,695
I do... I absolutely do.

1626
01:24:58,780 --> 01:24:59,571
Does that meanwe're married now?

1627
01:24:59,822 --> 01:25:01,823
Of course you'remarried George.

1628
01:25:01,907 --> 01:25:05,535

a more beautiful way for

10thwedding anniversary than by
