1
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,996
Good morning, bay area!

2
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:32,598
It's a beautiful Monday.

3
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,832
Hope you'll get out there

4
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:36,001
and try to forget
about this past weekend,

5
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:37,803
especially you sports fans.

6
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:41,507
I've never seen so much bad luck
in three days of my life.

7
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:44,343
If anybody put money down
on our bay-area favorites,

8
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:46,178
you might want to think
about robbing a bank

9
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,746
and getting out of the country.

10
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:50,616
Or maybe you should just
go back to Vegas and stay there.

11
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:53,352
I don't what to stay
besides "music cures all."

12
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:54,620
Here's hoping this new track

13
00:00:54,622 --> 00:00:57,056
from "the illness" will do
just that.

14
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:02,895
- Yeah?
- Thomas!

15
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:07,433
Hey, it's Sam calling
for my dad, Carl.

16
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:08,834
You have had

17
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:11,503
some of the worst luck anyone
has ever had.

18
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:13,272
I can have your money
for you in a week.

19
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:14,673
A week? The last time

20
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,775
my dad waited a week,
I had to find the guy.

21
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,744
Had to track him down
and cut off his finger.

22
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,012
Had to bring it back to my dad.

23
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:21,513
Ended up being the wrong finger.

24
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,115
The point is I got trouble.
See, it's about image.

25
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:25,451
I can't go around cutting off
everybody's fingers.

26
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:27,186
There's only digits
on a guy's hands,

27
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:29,321
then I got to move to toes...
I'll get it, all right?

28
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:30,622
Look,
I'm on a new film right now.

29
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,091
I could just ask...
a new blockbuster

30
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:33,459
like your last couple?

31
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:35,294
What was that last one
you did with, uh...

32
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:36,962
With a plot?

33
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,831
Just give me some time.

34
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:39,798
I'll have it.

35
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,934
Well, I'm sure.
I'll see you soon.

36
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:48,107
Hey, pop?

37
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:50,008
This guy's not gonna
come up with 15 grand,

38
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,844
even if he had a week.

39
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:57,516
You wanna make a bet this
becomes an amazing action movie?

40
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,870
Tomas will be
out any second now.

41
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:19,404
Don't start the car
until we see him.

42
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,406
Hi, you've reached Sara.
I'm not available.

43
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,442
Give me a call,
but leave me a message.

44
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:36,321
Don't worry about the sign.

45
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,823
It's a low-budget gig.

46
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,458
I'm sure you're gonna get
some great action for your reel.

47
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,094
Okay.

48
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,916
Hey, guys. Sorry for the wait.
There was a huge order

49
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:05,350
put in before yours...
A little bit confusion.

50
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,685
Are you gonna put it down

51
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:07,953
or are you gonna
keep babbling like an idiot?

52
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:09,855
You mean to tell me
whose is which?

53
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,356
That's mine.

54
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,026
So put his there and give
me my plate!

55
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,994
Oh, here.

56
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:19,498
- What are you doing?
- You're fired!

57
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,533
I didn't...

58
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,512
hey, Sara.

59
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,014
- Hey, baby.
- I need to crash with you

60
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:10,616
for a couple of nights.
Is that all right?

61
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:12,818
Yeah, sure. Is everything okay?

62
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,986
It's too hard
to explain right now.

63
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:15,520
All right. I'll see you soon.

64
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,589
All right, thanks, bye.

65
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:04,102
So, you've known Nick
longer than I have?

66
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,804
Uh, yeah.

67
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,339
I've known Nick
since we were kids.

68
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:11,076
But you been working with him
for two years now, right?

69
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:13,045
Uh-huh. So, um,

70
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:16,381
Nick probably gave you
a good idea of what we do here.

71
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,318
Yeah, he said you guys
get paid pretty well

72
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,019
for just taking a few pictures

73
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,821
and, uh...

74
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:26,858
Every now and then, things get
a little physical, but...

75
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,994
It's not like you guys
are running around in the middle

76
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:33,598
of a gun fight or something,
right?

77
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,201
Right?

78
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:39,371
Is that what he said?

79
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:40,539
W-well, yeah.

80
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,007
Is that...
don't worry about that.

81
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,910
Listen, sometimes things
get a little physical,

82
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:46,712
but I'm assuming
since Nick sent you here

83
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:49,681
today to fill in for him
that you understand that.

84
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:53,151
Well... yeah.

85
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:56,588
But...

86
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,857
- Yo.
- Hey, is punk ass there?

87
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,926
Yeah, your guy's here.
You wanna stop by?

88
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:03,595
Listen, I just got a ticket
for parking...

89
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,098
yeah, okay.

90
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:12,604
Who was that?

91
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,639
You blind?

92
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,778
- This the guy?
- Yep.

93
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,046
That's him.

94
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,414
Was that... did you just call?

95
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,915
Don't matter. Stand up.

96
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,517
- Wait, is this... is this...
- Don't worry about it.

97
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,619
Get up.

98
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,259
What are you, like, 20?

99
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,328
- No...
- Doesn't matter.

100
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:55,847
Wait, wait!

101
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:58,150
How far is this supposed to go?

102
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,661
Hey...

103
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:14,065
Nice.

104
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:20,472
- What, are you guys nuts?
- Hey, hey.

105
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:24,509
I didn't know he was gonna
do all of that.

106
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,211
And who is he?

107
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,546
That's Stan.

108
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:29,014
He's an old buddy of Nick and I.

109
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,382
He's been a bounty hunter
for a couple of years now,

110
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:32,584
so, you know,
we help each other out on cases.

111
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:35,187
You work with this guy?

112
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:36,455
Sometimes.

113
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:37,722
You got the job, by the way.

114
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,291
- Uh...
- Grab that folder right there.

115
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,993
We're gonna make a run, drop off
some pictures to a client.

116
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:46,531
Then you and I get to start
on this new case together.

117
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:47,566
Wha... I...

118
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:51,002
What about... what about Stan?

119
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:54,005
But Josh handled himself like a
pro just like you said he would.

120
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:58,009
- Hey!
- All right, he's coming.

121
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,178
I'll call you back.

122
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,550
Oh, you seem very okay
with everything

123
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,586
that just happened in there.
Man, I'm not cool with that.

124
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:10,021
Listen, I'm not putting my life
in the hands of someone

125
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,290
who needs some warning
before something goes down.

126
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,860
I wanted to see what you got.
Stan was down to help.

127
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,595
Now, you handled yourself
like Nick said you could,

128
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:19,598
but I had to be sure.

129
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,032
If you want to fill in for Nick,

130
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,934
I got your back as long
as you agree to get mine.

131
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:25,804
It's the only way
this is gonna work.

132
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:28,106
I told Nick
I'd help fill in for him 'cause

133
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,774
him and his girl
are having a baby

134
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,243
and he'd do the same thing
for me.

135
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:32,177
Otherwise, what?

136
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,346
You'd go get another job? Yeah.

137
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:35,680
Oh, really?

138
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,283
'Cause Nick told me about
the last couple jobs you had.

139
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,585
I could make money
doing something else.

140
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,888
Not as much as you
would with me, but, you know,

141
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,124
it's up to you.

142
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:49,394
I'm down as long
as that is my last test.

143
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,396
I told you you got the job.
Why would I need to test you

144
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,298
again?

145
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,738
So?

146
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,575
All right. All right.

147
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:05,944
Come on.

148
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:08,413
So, I'm curious.
You ever use a gun?

149
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:10,015
Yeah, at a range.

150
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:11,416
- Okay, good.
- Wait, wait, wait.

151
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,952
Is getting shot
at a part of this job?

152
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:15,420
Thinking positive is good,

153
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,822
but being prepared
is even better.

154
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,391
Do you have a gun?

155
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,692
Did Nick have a gun?

156
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:21,760
No, Nick never carried a gun.

157
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:24,162
That's probably why he got shot.

158
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,964
I'm joking.

159
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,632
I think Nick would have told you
if he got shot.

160
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:30,101
Well, I don't know!
He didn't tell me about Stan!

161
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,336
That's not funny, man.

162
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:33,004
I just want you to know
I'm carrying.

163
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,139
And I've never had to use mine,

164
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:35,340
but I feel better
having it on me.

165
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,975
So, you know, whatever you want.
Come on.

166
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,543
Let's go. Let's go.

167
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,755
So, shouldn't I get
a bullet-proof vest?

168
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,390
Yeah,
that's probably a good idea.

169
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,626
Well, then
shouldn't you get one, too?

170
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:56,494
No, why? I already have one.

171
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,002
So, who's this client
we're gonna go see?

172
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:07,138
Check out that folder.

173
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,573
So, what, we just...

174
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,642
We go over there, drop off
the pictures, that's it?

175
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:13,845
Yeah, then we start looking
for the action stars.

176
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:16,948
They're in there. You'll see.

177
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,483
I don't recognize this guy
at all.

178
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:21,286
Tomas de la Cruz is actually
a popular action star

179
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:25,156
from a small town in Peru.
He made some cheesy action films

180
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,092
and now he's got
himself a little cult following.

181
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:30,061
What do you mean "cheesy"
action films?

182
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:16,808
Cut!

183
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,877
- What the hell?
- What's wrong?

184
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,913
Somebody got the boom
in the shot.

185
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,416
Somebody got in my shot.

186
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:25,617
Who?

187
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,352
Jesus Christ.

188
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,987
Well,
I'm not doing all that again,

189
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:32,123
so you guys better just cut
that up and take it from, uh,

190
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:37,228
this guy's fall.
Uh, he's, uh, not conscious.

191
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,830
What?

192
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:41,933
This is not the fake piece
of wood.

193
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:46,171
Why would there be any real
pieces of wood anywhere near me

194
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:48,873
during this part of the fight?
And what is the purpose,

195
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:52,210
if I may ask,
of all this powder?

196
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,880
I told you
there's too much powder.

197
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,415
- Told me?
- Yeah. Yeah, you.

198
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,117
Why is that my responsibility?

199
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,318
- Have him do it.
- Hey, hold up.

200
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,388
Hold up. What? I could do it.

201
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,256
Wow. All right, you know what?

202
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:08,293
He can do it, okay?
I'm gonna go take a break.

203
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:09,861
You guys figure it out.
Let me know when you need me.

204
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:12,030
And get this guy some medical
attention or something.

205
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:14,132
Jesus.

206
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:43,595
Tomas.

207
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,864
Manny, just tell Carl
that I'm getting paid

208
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:48,767
enough for this masterpiece
I'm working on now.

209
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,870
Yeah, okay.

210
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:53,505
Who's this?

211
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:54,873
What?

212
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,508
That's just...

213
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,944
That's just his fan that came up
to me and wanted an autograph.

214
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,880
Yeah.

215
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:06,217
Yeah, sure he is. Come on.

216
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:09,654
You know I'm here to bring back
something of value.

217
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:11,422
All right.
I got some cash in the car,

218
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,358
all right? Just hang on.

219
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,726
Yeah, let me come with you.

220
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:17,328
Make sure your fans
don't get too hostile.

221
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,747
Tomas's Beatdown
put Carl's right-hand-man

222
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:37,582
- in the hospital.
- Damn.

223
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:39,484
Carl's not a guy
you want to be making bets with.

224
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,653
I mean, he's closer to a mob
boss than he is to a bookie.

225
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,221
So, why is Tomas up here

226
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:45,423
if he's an action star
down in Peru?

227
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,225
He thought he could break
into the industry up here.

228
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,893
Since he couldn't catch
a good break,

229
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,562
he started betting on a few
things to make some money back,

230
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:52,564
but the losses started
racking up pretty quickly.

231
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:56,134
So, what, we... we find him,
tell Carl where he is?

232
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:57,802
That's usually
how it's supposed to go,

233
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:59,237
but if it was that easy,

234
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,872
I wouldn't need a partner
to back me up.

235
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,241
People don't like being followed
around, you know?

236
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,143
Yeah, well...

237
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,211
Maybe they
can choose their friends

238
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:08,780
a little better then, you know?

239
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:11,482
All right, who is this
and where is he allowed

240
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,351
to be in action movies, man?

241
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,620
Sameer Yousef...
Another popular action star

242
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:17,455
- from Sahab.
- Where's that?

243
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:20,124
A small city in Jordan.
Doesn't matter.

244
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:23,328
Sameer's actually been following
in Tomas's footsteps for years.

245
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,463
He claims he taught him
everything he knows.

246
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:29,100
So, Sameer owes Carl money, too?

247
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:30,435
I don't know.

248
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:32,303
But Sameer's been
seen with Tomas.

249
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,105
He's the only connection
we have right now.

250
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,507
So far, we don't know if Tomas
has any other friends up here,

251
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,976
and we still don't even know
where the guy lives.

252
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:40,178
So then how are we even
supposed to find these guys?

253
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,746
Well, Tomas is gonna be tough,

254
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:45,116
but Sameer is actually a lead
in an indie action film

255
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,018
that is now on hold 'cause
he walked off.

256
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,020
So we're just gonna have to keep
an eye out for that production

257
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,455
to get up and running again.

258
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:38,136
Okay, cut!

259
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,671
Did he just say "cut"?

260
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:41,973
I'm feeling a little hungry,
so why don't you go ahead

261
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:45,476
and bring my stunt double
for now while I take a rest?

262
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:46,377
Okay.

263
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,146
Yeah, right.

264
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:49,347
Okay. Uh, well, all right.

265
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:50,815
Let's get the stunt double out.

266
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:52,650
Okay, this guy's terrible, man.
What do you say

267
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:55,019
we shoot the last few moves
with the stunt double?

268
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,387
Sure. It's good to make sure.

269
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,022
Yeah? Okay, yeah.

270
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:01,225
Yeah, we're gonna take it back
a few shots, all right guys?

271
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:09,300
Hey.

272
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,768
You know,
I could do these moves,

273
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,037
but I wouldn't want
to stop the pace right now.

274
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,105
Yeah, okay.

275
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,074
All right.

276
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:17,976
Hey, do your thing, man.

277
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,646
Do they look alike?

278
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,214
He came highly recommended.

279
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,482
Yeah, that's fine.

280
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,850
But we still
have to shoot the shot.

281
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,585
Now, how do we do
that when they don't look alike?

282
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,821
If you shoot it
at the right angle.

283
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,693
Guys, sorry about the confusion
on that last take.

284
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:38,596
Let's just work on the set
of moves that we did earlier,

285
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:39,831
and you guys will be great.

286
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,332
All right, guys.
Let's lock it down.

287
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,834
Give me a slate.

288
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,803
Scene 19, take 85.

289
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,638
Roll camera.

290
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:51,576
And action!

291
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:02,854
Wow.

292
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:08,493
Cut. Wow.

293
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:11,029
That was incredible, man. Huh.

294
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,363
Man, if this guy
lost 100 pounds,

295
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,098
you could have him as the lead.

296
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,333
Uh, all right, guys.

297
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:16,834
That's dinner.
Food's out in the truck.

298
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,936
Let's go.

299
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,245
Hey, man.

300
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:30,681
I think me and you, we trained
at the same martial arts school.

301
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,016
All right. I'm gonna go take...

302
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,951
I detect a little disbelief.

303
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:37,789
You're probably thinking
because I took a break time

304
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,525
it's your time
to shine and make me look bad!

305
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:41,926
I'm just trying to do my job.

306
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:44,896
If you have a problem,
talk to the director.

307
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:45,963
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

308
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:48,399
I studied 10 styles
of martial arts

309
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,669
and I never needed
this spinning kicking stuff,

310
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:55,740
just the element of surprise.

311
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:59,277
Hey, what's that?

312
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,281
That was pretty good.

313
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:04,816
I'm glad you passed my test.

314
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:08,152
I only surround myself
with the best talent there is.

315
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:11,722
And you, my friend, are good
enough to be my stunt double.

316
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:15,460
- Find someone else, asshole.
- Okay.

317
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:16,828
Okay, that's fine.

318
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,896
But just to let you know
that you won't be nothing

319
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:21,666
in this industry.

320
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,134
Nothing!

321
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:24,802
Hey, what's going on, man?

322
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,704
Why am I seeing
Dave walk off like that?

323
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,806
If you can't hire
a professional stunt double...

324
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:31,576
hey, buddy.
That guy's obviously a pro.

325
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:33,978
He's been doing it for years!
Yeah?

326
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,582
Well, y-y-your pro just
attacked me.

327
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,186
I can't believe this guy
is an action anywhere.

328
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:43,955
I got to see his movies.

329
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,857
No, you don't.

330
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,795
All right, man.

331
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,830
Time to help
break someone's heart.

332
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,765
Grab that folder.

333
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:12,383
Are we just gonna give her
the photos and that's it?

334
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:13,751
Isn't that kind of cold?

335
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:15,620
We're not her psychiatrist.

336
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:17,989
What do you want to do?

337
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,124
I don't know.

338
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,770
- Who's this?
- I-I'm Josh.

339
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,772
Um, I'm... I'm sorry for...

340
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:37,408
Just come on inside.
I'll get your money.

341
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:56,561
All right,
let me see the pictures.

342
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,100
Sorry, Michelle.

343
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,823
Hey, um...

344
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:29,894
Michelle, you know,
sometimes people, you know,

345
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,463
they've...

346
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:35,032
son of a bitch is gonna pay.

347
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,805
Was that normal
for her to carry a switchblade

348
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,340
- in her apron?
- I don't know.

349
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:44,041
I'm hungry, though. You hungry?

350
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:06,163
- Oh, morning.
- Afternoon.

351
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:07,198
Really?

352
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,499
Yeah.

353
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,800
I made you some breakfast.

354
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,802
You might have
to heat it up a little.

355
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,773
Thanks.

356
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,742
Hey, you think I
could borrow your car again?

357
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:18,909
I-I-I got to get down to...

358
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,811
Tomas, I have to get to class

359
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,380
and I have to work later.

360
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:25,249
Right, right.

361
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:28,853
What is it?

362
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:30,388
I was thinking, you know,

363
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,590
you and I, we should... need
to take a trip, you know?

364
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:34,025
Like, let's get out of here,
you know?

365
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:35,559
Let's do something
to break the routine.

366
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:37,094
Just me and you, you know?

367
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:38,863
Uh, that would be nice,

368
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:42,133
but you know I have finals
next week.

369
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,267
But maybe after that.

370
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:45,036
Mm-hmm.

371
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:49,407
And besides, you have
to finish your movie, right?

372
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:50,608
Yeah, you're right.

373
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,944
- Yeah.
- Okay. I got to go.

374
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:12,697
- Yeah, who is it?
- It's Tomas.

375
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,786
If you're in debt,
why don't you just use this

376
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:37,455
to pay whoever you owe money to?

377
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:39,557
'Cause I think I need
a little bit more on the down

378
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:41,258
before I could start
making payments.

379
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,828
Huh. Okay. Same time tomorrow...

380
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,964
You got a passport and I.D.

381
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:51,068
Okay.

382
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:56,307
Dick.

383
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,346
Mmm.

384
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,818
What?

385
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,587
Want me... want me
to get something else?

386
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:11,122
You're... you're...

387
00:23:11,124 --> 00:23:13,090
You're not even worried
about what Michelle might do

388
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:16,293
- to her now-ex-boyfriend?
- Why?

389
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:18,295
Do you have some special place
in your heart for cheaters?

390
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:21,565
No, I... I'm just saying,
what if she actually goes

391
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,801
and nunchakus this guy up
or worse?

392
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:25,803
Yeah, well, she might do that.

393
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:27,705
She might have done
that to the last guy.

394
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:29,073
I guess we'll never know, right?

395
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:32,176
Unless she pays us
to follow her.

396
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:33,811
Okay, so...

397
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:36,781
You're saying
if you don't see anything, then.

398
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:40,117
Out of sight out of mind.

399
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,752
I suggest you get used to it,
all right?

400
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,187
Nick and I got paid
for delivering information

401
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:45,823
to people,
not for what they do with it.

402
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:49,527
Hang on. I got to take this.

403
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:51,095
Hello?

404
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:56,267
Welcome back to "celebrity
action rehab live!"

405
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,468
Did you move my stuff?

406
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,337
- What stuff?
- My makeup bag in the bathroom.

407
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:01,539
Did you move my stuff?

408
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:04,708
Why would I move... Oh, really?

409
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:12,516
What's this? Ladies, ladies.

410
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:14,318
Are we here to fight addictions

411
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,854
or are we here
to fight each other?

412
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,725
Hey, you down to make
a couple extra g's tonight?

413
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:23,694
Uh, yeah.
What... what's going on?

414
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:26,130
Uh, my buddy needs backup.

415
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:28,098
W-what does that mean, "backup"?

416
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,800
Uh, we're probably just gonna
make sure he doesn't,

417
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,102
uh... nothing goes crazy.
Whatever.

418
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:33,704
Hey, you ever see that show,

419
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,539
"celebrity action rehab"?

420
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,241
- No, what...
- It's stupid.

421
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:42,146
- But what are we gonna do?
- Prime time slot.

422
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:44,548
Let's go.
I'll tell you in the car.

423
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,717
W-wha...

424
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:49,253
you're real smart, bitch.

425
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:51,922
I... I just want to know
who we're backing up.

426
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,466
Hey!

427
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,641
Thanks man.

428
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:13,177
Why you always messing
with my car?

429
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:18,182
Who is this?

430
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:40,037
- So, what's up?
- Some guy stole a Van

431
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,172
full of missing artwork
on the way to the museum.

432
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:43,874
I've been telling him
for an hour now...

433
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,510
Three guys,
didn't really recognize them.

434
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:48,245
They're probably buyers.

435
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:49,947
Okay, so, who hired you?
The museum?

436
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:51,682
No, actually,
this is the delivery company.

437
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:53,684
They figure the missing Van
would be low priority

438
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:54,685
for the police.

439
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:56,887
So u-haul hires bounty hunters?

440
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,389
Was I talking to you?

441
00:25:58,391 --> 00:25:59,957
I'm just saying
it's kind of funny,

442
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:01,425
a delivery company's hiring...
if you want

443
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:03,227
a cut of this money,
you better watch your mouth.

444
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:06,063
I'm not even saying anything
about you, man.

445
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,666
Yeah, I didn't figure
you'd want this again.

446
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:10,034
Again?

447
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:11,969
You're memory's a little
altered there, buddy.

448
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:13,070
Hey, hey. Come on.

449
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,806
Look, we're here
to get your back,

450
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:18,142
okay? Relax.

451
00:26:18,144 --> 00:26:20,077
- Let's go.
- All right.

452
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,479
So, anyway, like I was saying...

453
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,223
All right, there's four guys.

454
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:35,392
They're unloading the artwork
right now.

455
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:43,300
These guys are low-level.

456
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:45,736
The leader looks like he's young
noir or something like that.

457
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:48,038
Three guys in there look
like they're going clubbing

458
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,074
- afterwards.
- Wait, wait.

459
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:51,842
How many guys
you trying to catch?

460
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:53,377
I don't know.

461
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:54,812
Why don't you get a calculator
and go figure it out?

462
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:57,114
- Hey, I'm just...
- So, what's the plan?

463
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,983
My client's paying me to get
the artwork back.

464
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:00,250
The Van they sold.

465
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:03,721
And whatever happens, happens.

466
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:06,390
Question... why wouldn't
any of these guys have guns

467
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:07,658
or something? They probably do.

468
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,094
But if they do, then so do we.

469
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:12,630
Yeah, well, I don't.

470
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:15,232
Oh, yeah.

471
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:18,969
What did you expect, you idiot?

472
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,437
Don't worry about it.
There's two of us.

473
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:21,438
We got your back.

474
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,473
If people start shooting,

475
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:24,074
just hang back.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

476
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:25,476
Hang back and see
if you get a cut of the money.

477
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:26,944
Don't worry.

478
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:30,280
Just do what you do.

479
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,282
Oh, what are they doing here?

480
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,952
- Who?
- Those three guys in black.

481
00:27:34,954 --> 00:27:36,920
Those are Carl's guys. Oh, good.

482
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:38,422
So we don't have
to worry about them?

483
00:27:38,424 --> 00:27:39,523
I don't know.

484
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:41,158
I'm not buddies
with them or anything.

485
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,961
I'm just saying
I know them and they know me.

486
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:45,529
So what now?

487
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:47,498
Well, I'm guessing they're here
to do some kind of deal,

488
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,199
and since we're trying to stop
that from happening...

489
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,035
all right, all right, all
right. Well, we'll see.

490
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:53,537
All right, hey,
I'm gonna go take those three.

491
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:56,440
Fine.
I got the guys on the left.

492
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:58,842
- W-what about the other guys?
- Okay.

493
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,011
On three?

494
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,988
Hey!
Everybody get on the ground!

495
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:14,892
Ken?

496
00:28:14,894 --> 00:28:16,126
Hey, man.

497
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:17,528
I'm just helping my buddy
with these guys.

498
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,730
We're not here for you.
Hey, get on the ground.

499
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:21,065
Stan, just one second.

500
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:22,933
Carl sent us here
to pick up some stuff.

501
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:24,468
Think you know what that means.

502
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,070
Yeah, well, my buddy's here
to get that stuff back,

503
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:27,604
so I'm sure you understand.

504
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:29,273
I'm sure Carl will, too.

505
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:30,774
I don't think Carl likes you
as much as you think he does.

506
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:32,743
Hey, man, I'm still
working for him just like you.

507
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:34,945
Come on, guys. Let's go.

508
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:41,819
Hey! Why isn't dick face

509
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:43,487
on the ground? What did you say?

510
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:46,724
I said, "why are you
on the ground, dick face?"

511
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:48,792
Stan, relax.

512
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:50,294
Guns are for pussies.

513
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:53,097
And you, my friend, are a pussy.

514
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:56,233
I would own you. Oh, would you?

515
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,136
Just calm down, Stan!

516
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:16,053
Oh.

517
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:18,222
Whoops.

518
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:27,698
Nick's substitute, right?

519
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:52,082
Thanks.

520
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:05,809
You didn't seem yourself
while you were training today.

521
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:07,077
What's the problem?

522
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:09,212
This last film
I worked on didn't go too well.

523
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:12,049
First the director
made a comment about my weight.

524
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:15,952
David, shape and size cannot
hide talent.

525
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:17,687
It adds character,

526
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:21,091
and your father
was the living proof of that.

527
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:24,061
Yeah, but he didn't try to make
it the entertainment industry.

528
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:27,364
I bet he could have
if that's what he wanted to do.

529
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:29,266
Before he passed away,

530
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:32,035
he did everything
he wanted to do in life.

531
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:35,005
He never let anyone tell him
he couldn't do anything,

532
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:37,474
like you when you first
started training with me.

533
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:39,276
That's training here with you.

534
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:40,811
Out there,
it's a different world.

535
00:34:40,813 --> 00:34:43,246
During break, the lead
tried to pick a fight with me.

536
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,681
Jealous of your talent, maybe?

537
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:46,583
He seemed pretty confident
to me.

538
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,452
People who pick fights

539
00:34:48,454 --> 00:34:50,520
usually don't have someone
to fight with them,

540
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:53,056
and people
who talk down to people

541
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:54,758
usually need someone to listen.

542
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,259
So what am I supposed to do?

543
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,495
Defend someone that wants
to fight me and lend my ear

544
00:34:58,497 --> 00:35:00,397
to someone that's insulted me?

545
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:02,599
Not challenging enough for you?

546
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:11,508
Hello?

547
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,376
- Hey, David. It's frank.
- Yeah.

548
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:15,679
Yeah,
about that Sameer thing, well,

549
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:18,582
here's the deal...
Nobody saw nothing,

550
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:21,184
so unfortunately, it's
Sameer's word against yours.

551
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:22,385
And what did he say?

552
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:23,753
Well, apparently he says

553
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:25,388
he was talking to you
about martial arts,

554
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:29,493
you somehow became offended
and attacked him.

555
00:35:29,495 --> 00:35:31,128
What an asshole.

556
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,463
Yeah, basically he's told
everyone on set that, you know,

557
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,365
he refuses to work
around a maniac.

558
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:37,100
So what does that mean for me?

559
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:39,870
Well, since he's the lead,

560
00:35:39,872 --> 00:35:42,706
they're just gonna go
with another stunt double.

561
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,676
But, hey,
d-don't worry about it.

562
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:48,445
You know,
I'll keep an eye out for you.

563
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:49,946
And besides,
think about it this way...

564
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:52,482
As long as people
keep eating all that fast food,

565
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,551
- you'll have work.
- Okay.

566
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:56,419
Hey, listen,
I had a breakfast burrito

567
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:57,721
and that thing's working its way
through me.

568
00:35:57,723 --> 00:36:00,056
I got to get to a toilet fast.

569
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:01,525
Yeah. Bye.

570
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:03,760
Yeah, talk to you soon, buddy.

571
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:21,845
- What's up?
- Oh, hey.

572
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:25,182
How's it going? Who's this guy?

573
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:28,218
Uh, it's... bill

574
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,620
no, I'm Tony.

575
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:36,860
Might want to make sure
it's actually bill.

576
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:38,195
I don't want to keep you...
You're busy...

577
00:36:38,197 --> 00:36:39,596
But is my dad here?

578
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:41,131
- Yeah, what's up?
- Rich, Vic,

579
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:44,167
and Ivan were supposed to
pick up some artwork for my dad,

580
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:46,002
but they screwed it up.

581
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:48,004
I can give them one more chance,
but then I have to kill

582
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:49,239
all three of them.

583
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:50,807
And then that's a bummer

584
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,242
because you got to take care
of the bodies... you know,

585
00:36:52,244 --> 00:36:54,344
digging all the ditches
and however you do it.

586
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:55,946
It's not my... you know what?

587
00:36:55,948 --> 00:36:57,747
I'll handle it.

588
00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:00,550
Well, see you around...

589
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,686
William. Um...

590
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:06,389
Well, actually, I probably
won't ever see you again.

591
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,592
But see you.

592
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:26,910
Isn't this fun? Huh?

593
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,814
Aren't we all having fun? Right?

594
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:35,018
Silence!

595
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:49,332
Rico, my old friend.

596
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:52,569
- Hyena.
- I thought you were dead.

597
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:56,106
Didn't take.

598
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:57,907
Ha ha ha.

599
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,949
Get out of my way.

600
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,089
You're just in time.

601
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:17,427
We're having a little party
for this bitch.

602
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:21,131
Well, you know what they say...

603
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:25,568
"It's not a bitch party
without a bitch."

604
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:28,038
Indeed.

605
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,639
One moment.

606
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:32,575
Hyena, there's just one problem.

607
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:33,843
Yes?

608
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:37,914
This bitch is my sister.

609
00:38:50,062 --> 00:38:51,961
My nuts!

610
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:56,299
Oh!

611
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:09,112
Drop the gun.

612
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:12,248
I'm British.

613
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,484
I thought you were German.

614
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:16,486
Well, people change.

615
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:18,288
Now turn around.

616
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,259
Ha!

617
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:27,630
What good is your code
of Peruvian Bushido now?

618
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:34,104
It's good for this.

619
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:39,876
Rico!

620
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:45,982
Easy. Nothing.

621
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,123
Oh, Rico, if you weren't
my brother...

622
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:56,426
I'm not. I'm your step-brother.

623
00:39:56,428 --> 00:40:00,630
Tomas de la Cruz!

624
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:23,286
Man, I know I can make it
like you did.

625
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:32,262
And I'll never forget
what you told me that day.

626
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:34,164
Respect.

627
00:40:49,181 --> 00:40:50,914
What the hell
are you doing, man?

628
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:55,452
Sorry, Mr. de la Cruz?
I'm a huge fan of yours.

629
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:57,086
I love your movies.

630
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:01,057
And "multiple impact"
is such an action classic!

631
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:03,426
- You... you've seen my films?
- Yes, sir.

632
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:04,928
All three.

633
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:07,864
And I started acting and
studying several martial arts

634
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:10,266
to be as great of an action star
as you.

635
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:12,001
R-really?
Now, see, that's funny,

636
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:14,804
'cause actually I don't even
take martial arts, man.

637
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,306
I just kind
of punch and kick people.

638
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:17,507
No way, man.

639
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:19,375
You must be a natural then,

640
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:23,279
because I studied 10 martial
arts to be as great as you, man.

641
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:28,551
- Dang, 10?
- And I read all 10 books twice.

642
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:29,819
Oh, I see.

643
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,855
So you read fighting books.

644
00:41:31,857 --> 00:41:33,923
- Yes, sir.
- Well, hey, you know what?

645
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:36,392
Whatever keeps you
motivated, you know, is...

646
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:37,827
Is good, I guess.

647
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,262
Thank you. Thank you.

648
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:40,497
Yeah, hey.

649
00:41:40,499 --> 00:41:42,465
Can I take an autograph?

650
00:41:42,467 --> 00:41:46,536
Uh... sure.

651
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:50,507
Can you make it out to, uh,
Sameer Yousef, please?

652
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:54,477
I can't believe
that I just met you now.

653
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:58,615
I was on my way to an audition
downtown and...

654
00:41:58,617 --> 00:42:01,084
This must be a sign.

655
00:42:01,086 --> 00:42:03,286
Unbelievable. There you go, man.

656
00:42:03,288 --> 00:42:05,622
Thank you, sir.

657
00:42:05,624 --> 00:42:08,458
Can I take one picture?
Just... just one picture?

658
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,692
Yeah, sure.

659
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:11,761
My friends won't believe this.

660
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:23,373
All right.

661
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,275
Yes!

662
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:29,012
- Hey, this is me.
- Yeah.

663
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:30,413
Oh, hey, man. You know what?

664
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:31,848
I got to go.
It was really great to meet you

665
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,750
and, uh,
take it easy, all right?

666
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:35,885
Is everything okay?

667
00:42:38,857 --> 00:42:41,658
- Aye!
- Hey, is something wrong?

668
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,893
Is... is it paparazzi?

669
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:48,264
I'll create a divergence!
What are you doing?

670
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:50,333
Isn't that your...
Get on the train!

671
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,171
Hey, Vic.
Let's get ready to move.

672
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:56,472
Looks like they're getting
on this bus.

673
00:42:56,474 --> 00:42:58,608
I swear,
if we lose these guys, you guys

674
00:42:58,610 --> 00:42:59,809
are all walking back to Carl's.

675
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:01,144
What? Why?

676
00:43:01,146 --> 00:43:03,179
'Cause you guys
keep asking me stupid questions.

677
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:05,048
Let's go.

678
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:14,157
I get it.

679
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:16,292
You keep pretending that people
are chasing after you

680
00:43:16,294 --> 00:43:18,795
so you keep your acting sharp.

681
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:20,630
- Wow.
- Yeah, no.

682
00:43:20,632 --> 00:43:21,898
It... it helps. It does.

683
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:22,966
It helps.

684
00:43:22,968 --> 00:43:24,767
Wow. That is fantastic.

685
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,003
Hey, can you
give me any other advice?

686
00:43:27,005 --> 00:43:28,304
I would really appreciate it.

687
00:43:28,306 --> 00:43:31,507
- Well, it's a tough business.
- Okay.

688
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:33,876
All right, there's always gonna
be some asshole trying to Jack

689
00:43:33,878 --> 00:43:35,712
you of your opportunities,
all right?

690
00:43:35,714 --> 00:43:37,380
- So don't trust anybody.
- Okay.

691
00:43:37,382 --> 00:43:39,182
- Okay?
- Thank you. Thank you.

692
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:40,750
Yeah, I hope you
make your audition, man.

693
00:43:40,752 --> 00:43:43,152
Thank you so much, sir.

694
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:44,420
Hey!

695
00:43:44,422 --> 00:43:46,456
Hey, it's an honor!

696
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:06,509
Whatever.

697
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:13,549
Man, that was a waste of time.

698
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:15,618
He didn't even have a gun.
Don't worry about it.

699
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,553
Look, we've got snacks now.

700
00:44:23,795 --> 00:44:25,495
Hey, man.
You got to try these chips.

701
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:28,264
Those look like not chips,
all right?

702
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:30,233
Why are we walking
through all these alleys?

703
00:44:30,235 --> 00:44:31,567
I don't like to pay
for the parking.

704
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:33,302
Chinatown sucks.

705
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:40,777
Man, I don't need one of those.
What I really need right now

706
00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:42,278
is... one of those?

707
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,281
Hey, shut up and give me
your wallets... both of you.

708
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:47,450
Man.

709
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:51,521
This is just...
what are you doing?

710
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:53,723
- I'm giving him my wallet.
- Just shut up.

711
00:44:53,725 --> 00:44:54,957
And you, do the same thing...

712
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:59,228
Wallet, now.
No, I don't want to.

713
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,863
- What?
- Are you crazy?

714
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:02,365
Yeah, man. What are you, crazy?

715
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:04,267
No.

716
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:08,971
Look, if I give you my wallet,
can I put

717
00:45:08,973 --> 00:45:10,473
these down on the ground?
Whatever.

718
00:45:10,475 --> 00:45:12,542
- Wallet, now.
- You know what?

719
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:14,610
I don't want to do that 'cause
it smells like someone

720
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:17,046
took a piss here and I
don't want to mess up my chips.

721
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:19,082
- So you hold this.
- Hold this?

722
00:45:19,084 --> 00:45:21,584
Hold this.

723
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:43,172
Look at that.

724
00:45:43,174 --> 00:45:45,575
Yeah, uh,
it's a gun with no... no clip.

725
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:46,709
There's no bullets.

726
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:48,644
Always complaining.

727
00:45:48,646 --> 00:45:50,613
Okay, come on, man.

728
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,720
So, this guy, Pete,
he makes fake I.D.S

729
00:45:57,722 --> 00:46:01,390
yeah, there's only a few guys
that are really pro.

730
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,207
Right there... white door.

731
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:19,942
So, what? We just wait?

732
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:22,044
- Yep.
- All right.

733
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,635
- Hello?
- I told you weren't out of it.

734
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:46,803
What's up?

735
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:48,404
New martial arts film casting

736
00:46:48,406 --> 00:46:50,573
for an overweight actor
who can throw a couple of kicks

737
00:46:50,575 --> 00:46:52,909
and they don't care
what you look like.

738
00:46:52,911 --> 00:46:56,512
Now who's the man?

739
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:02,852
- Live!
- What am I gonna do?

740
00:47:02,854 --> 00:47:04,787
Take drugs through my phone?
Is there an app for that?

741
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:07,356
What right do you have to take
my phone from me anyway?

742
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:09,458
It's part of the agreement
that all patients

743
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:10,893
make when they're receiving
treatment here.

744
00:47:10,895 --> 00:47:13,596
Attacking the nurse is not
the way to deal...

745
00:47:13,598 --> 00:47:15,965
- Attacking?
- You stomped on her foot.

746
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,466
I'm sorry, okay?

747
00:47:17,468 --> 00:47:19,669
After you apologize
to the right nurse.

748
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:22,271
Okay, fine!

749
00:47:22,273 --> 00:47:23,506
Okay, stop it right there.

750
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:25,908
Take it back a couple
of seconds.

751
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:28,344
Yeah, what am I gonna do?
Take drugs through my phone?

752
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:29,745
Is there an app for that?

753
00:47:29,747 --> 00:47:32,014
Okay, right when she
says "I hate this place,"

754
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:33,382
I want you to cut to her crying

755
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:34,784
while she's talking
about her dad's abuse.

756
00:47:34,786 --> 00:47:36,619
And then I want you to cut back
to her

757
00:47:36,621 --> 00:47:38,421
talking to Amy saying "I've
never had a friend like you,"

758
00:47:38,423 --> 00:47:41,357
and then I want you to cut to
her slapping Amy.

759
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,192
I think that's gonna
play out really nicely.

760
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,361
Yeah, no problem.

761
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:48,064
Hello?

762
00:47:48,066 --> 00:47:50,433
- Hi, Amera?
- Yeah.

763
00:47:50,435 --> 00:47:52,068
Shelley's not working well
with us.

764
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:54,003
She's getting increasingly
violent.

765
00:47:54,005 --> 00:47:57,807
Yeah, and you've been doing
such an amazing job with her.

766
00:47:57,809 --> 00:47:59,408
Take your bad shoes and go out!

767
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,043
I'm placing a request
to transfer to...

768
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:03,646
oh... oh, wait, wait, wait.
No, you can't do that.

769
00:48:03,648 --> 00:48:06,449
Our ratings have gone way up
since she joined the show.

770
00:48:06,451 --> 00:48:08,584
You know, my contract
says I have the right

771
00:48:08,586 --> 00:48:11,254
to treat these patients
as I see fit.

772
00:48:11,256 --> 00:48:15,725
Okay. No problem at all.
Thank you.

773
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:18,194
You are wasting my time.

774
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:20,396
Did you not hear me?
It's looking good.

775
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:23,466
What is wrong with you?
Out! Out!

776
00:48:23,468 --> 00:48:25,735
We really need to find somebody
to replace Shelley

777
00:48:25,737 --> 00:48:27,637
before she goes.

778
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:36,679
Are you insane?

779
00:48:36,681 --> 00:48:40,016
I was just showing him
how to do the moves properly.

780
00:48:40,018 --> 00:48:42,985
Proper... y-you hit the guy
in the back of the head

781
00:48:42,987 --> 00:48:44,654
with a wooden sword!

782
00:48:44,656 --> 00:48:46,656
How are you gonna hit him
in the back of the head

783
00:48:46,658 --> 00:48:48,357
if he's supposed
to be watching you?

784
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:50,226
Hey, I took it upon myself

785
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:52,428
to make sure
that he does his job right,

786
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,964
which you guys apparently
screwed it up again.

787
00:48:54,966 --> 00:48:57,700
Well, apparently I don't think
this went down the way

788
00:48:57,702 --> 00:48:58,734
you say it did,

789
00:48:58,736 --> 00:49:01,837
because you're obviously
a no-talent poser

790
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:04,373
who was suggested to me
by a casting director

791
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:05,641
that I'm never gonna use again.

792
00:49:05,643 --> 00:49:07,176
Huh? What was her name again?

793
00:49:07,178 --> 00:49:09,111
Was it your cousin? Huh?

794
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:11,948
Well, you can't fire me unless
you're gonna re-shoot everything

795
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:14,450
I just did, which is gonna
end up costing you.

796
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:16,118
I'll be just fine. Thanks, man.

797
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,888
But you can expect a lawsuit
from this guy when he wakes up.

798
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:23,225
Now get the hell off my set.

799
00:49:23,227 --> 00:49:24,794
All right, guys.

800
00:49:24,796 --> 00:49:27,196
I guess we'll finish these
scenes when this guy's okay.

801
00:49:27,198 --> 00:49:30,800
And we'll do the pickups when we
find a new actor, all right?

802
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:32,835
Now let's... let's start
setting up, guys.

803
00:49:32,837 --> 00:49:34,270
Okay, I'm gonna
give you one last...

804
00:49:34,272 --> 00:49:37,073
get the hell of my set,
you maniac!

805
00:49:37,075 --> 00:49:38,107
Okay, you know what?

806
00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:39,575
You're making a mistake.

807
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:42,211
You're firing
the next Tomas de la Cruz!

808
00:49:42,213 --> 00:49:43,412
Who?

809
00:49:43,414 --> 00:49:47,149
All right, somebody
call the police.

810
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:49,618
This is bullshit!

811
00:49:51,923 --> 00:49:54,690
Hey, w-when can I get bullets
for this thing?

812
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:56,025
I mean, what is the point...
wait, wait, wait, wait,

813
00:49:56,027 --> 00:49:58,394
wait, wait. There he is.

814
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:01,797
So what do we do?

815
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:03,399
Do we... do we call Carl
now or what?

816
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:04,867
No, no, no, no.

817
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:07,069
He's gonna be in an out
and on his way.

818
00:50:07,071 --> 00:50:08,637
So we'll just wait right here

819
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:10,639
and then follow him
to wherever he's staying.

820
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:19,582
Thanks.

821
00:50:25,923 --> 00:50:29,625
Oh. Here we go.

822
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:25,614
- Hello?
- Yeah, we found Tomas.

823
00:51:25,616 --> 00:51:28,717
He's at 2135 green street.

824
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:31,020
It's an apartment building.
Nice going, Kenny.

825
00:51:31,022 --> 00:51:32,988
Uh, we tailed him from a guy
who makes fake I.D.S,

826
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:35,391
so I'm guessing he's not
gonna be here for very long.

827
00:51:35,393 --> 00:51:36,926
I'll have some guys there soon.

828
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:38,828
All right.

829
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:48,037
Last chance,
then you're digging ditches.

830
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:50,306
Change first, but whatever.

831
00:51:50,308 --> 00:51:51,640
What happens now?

832
00:51:51,642 --> 00:51:53,109
Well,
he's sending some guys over,

833
00:51:53,111 --> 00:51:55,878
so all we got to do is make sure
Tomas doesn't leave.

834
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:14,296
See that dude in front there?

835
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:16,298
That's that prick
I was talking about.

836
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,766
Oh, rich?

837
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:23,672
That little guy in the middle?
Yeah?

838
00:52:23,674 --> 00:52:26,575
He's been wanting
to fight me since day one.

839
00:52:26,577 --> 00:52:29,245
I don't know
what his problem is.

840
00:52:29,247 --> 00:52:32,448
I almost feel bad
that we're helping these guys.

841
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:39,788
Listen, um...

842
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:42,958
I'm probably not gonna be
seeing you again anytime soon.

843
00:52:45,897 --> 00:52:47,796
What do you mean?

844
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:54,303
God, whatever, Tomas.
You know what?

845
00:52:54,305 --> 00:52:58,307
You're being just like any other
guy with your bullshit.

846
00:52:58,309 --> 00:52:59,742
- Will you just wait a second?
- No.

847
00:52:59,744 --> 00:53:01,110
I will not wait a second.

848
00:53:01,112 --> 00:53:03,779
And I will not wait
for your explanation.

849
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:07,983
I got to admit, though.

850
00:53:07,985 --> 00:53:11,220
I have never heard the "bookie's
after me for $15,000" excuse.

851
00:53:11,222 --> 00:53:12,688
Lame.

852
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,730
I really wish you'd just
listen to me for a second.

853
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:26,202
Yeah? Can I help you guys?

854
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:30,940
- No, but he can.
- Okay.

855
00:53:30,942 --> 00:53:32,508
All right, all right, all right.
You know what?

856
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,043
Just... can we take
this outside?

857
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:36,412
Why? Is that
where you keep your money?

858
00:53:36,414 --> 00:53:37,780
I don't have it right now,
all right?

859
00:53:37,782 --> 00:53:39,281
But I'm gonna get it.
Why don't you just

860
00:53:39,283 --> 00:53:40,849
call your buddy here
and have him bring it instead?

861
00:53:40,851 --> 00:53:42,685
- My buddy?
- We saw you guys last week

862
00:53:42,687 --> 00:53:44,753
by the piers.
You were giving him something.

863
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:47,056
That's not my buddy, all right.

864
00:53:47,058 --> 00:53:51,560
That's just some fan
who wanted an autograph.

865
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,696
Can we get your autograph, too?

866
00:53:53,698 --> 00:53:56,365
All right, this is crazy.
I'm gonna call the police.

867
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:58,567
Aw, now
why you got to go do that?

868
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,734
So, how long's it take
three punks to kick the crap

869
00:54:31,736 --> 00:54:33,669
out of one action star?

870
00:54:50,321 --> 00:54:53,555
What? Let's go.

871
00:55:04,001 --> 00:55:05,768
What do we do? What do we do?

872
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:07,670
What do we do?
Call an ambulance.

873
00:55:31,696 --> 00:55:34,330
Yeah, yeah...

874
00:55:47,712 --> 00:55:52,014
Hey! Who you calling? Huh?

875
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:54,950
You gonna come
kick this phone away from me?

876
00:55:54,952 --> 00:55:56,752
- What if I do?
- See what happens.

877
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:01,990
I'll get you later.

878
00:56:37,862 --> 00:56:42,698
Welcome back to "celebrity
action rehab live!"

879
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,833
Now we will meditate
to the music

880
00:56:44,835 --> 00:56:48,103
as our anger
and tension melt away.

881
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,708
- Guess who I saw yesterday.
- Who did you see?

882
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:55,043
- Sylvester wonton.
- No way.

883
00:56:55,045 --> 00:56:57,112
Oh, what was the name
of that last movie he did?

884
00:56:57,114 --> 00:56:59,081
- "Garbage man."
- Did anybody go see that?

885
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:01,316
Yeah, I did.
It was like being a tampon

886
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:03,986
in a heavy flow,
but you needed another one.

887
00:57:03,988 --> 00:57:05,721
I needed to call for backup.

888
00:57:05,723 --> 00:57:08,724
Well, Ivan's dead.

889
00:57:08,726 --> 00:57:10,793
I can't kill rich and Vic now.

890
00:57:10,795 --> 00:57:13,695
Not... "let's all three
of them," you know?

891
00:57:13,697 --> 00:57:16,165
It doesn't feel right.

892
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:20,769
They're like the three brothers,
the three amigos,

893
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:23,138
three compadres.

894
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:26,175
And when I started bugging him,
he got pissed at me 'cause

895
00:57:26,177 --> 00:57:27,443
his friend died.

896
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:29,511
And I'm like, "am I supposed
to care about that?"

897
00:57:29,513 --> 00:57:30,646
He'd be perfect for the show.

898
00:57:30,648 --> 00:57:32,748
I'll be right back.

899
00:57:47,865 --> 00:57:49,932
Are you just stupid?

900
00:57:49,934 --> 00:57:52,801
Is that what the problem is?

901
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:53,969
He put Manny in the hospital.

902
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:55,504
He just threw Ivan
out of a window.

903
00:57:55,506 --> 00:57:58,207
So you thought, "kill
this guy... an eye for an eye."

904
00:57:58,209 --> 00:57:59,641
Cover your tracks really well

905
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:00,876
"and everything
will be just fine?"

906
00:58:00,878 --> 00:58:04,346
Never mind the 15 grand,

907
00:58:04,348 --> 00:58:06,181
so long as you teach someone
a lesson?

908
00:58:06,183 --> 00:58:08,484
That's what the goal is here?
He just killed Ivan.

909
00:58:08,486 --> 00:58:11,420
Ivan was a prick
and he slept with your sister.

910
00:58:11,422 --> 00:58:12,855
Ask him.

911
00:58:14,058 --> 00:58:15,157
Why don't you speak English...

912
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:16,558
hey, why don't you shut up

913
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,094
or I'll kill you right here?
How about that?

914
00:58:19,096 --> 00:58:20,562
Look, let
me just explain to Carl, okay?

915
00:58:20,564 --> 00:58:24,199
I said shut up or I will drop
you in the street.

916
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:26,635
You're not explaining anything
to my dad.

917
00:58:26,637 --> 00:58:29,438
In fact, he doesn't want you
anywhere near his curb.

918
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,406
Here's what you two
are gonna do... you're gonna

919
00:58:31,408 --> 00:58:34,710
find Ken and his little buddy
and you're gonna follow them

920
00:58:34,712 --> 00:58:36,111
wherever they go.

921
00:58:36,113 --> 00:58:38,113
And you better hope
Ken finds Sameer,

922
00:58:38,115 --> 00:58:40,983
and you really better hope
Sameer has that money

923
00:58:40,985 --> 00:58:42,951
you're so sure he has.

924
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:44,353
What if Ken
doesn't find anything?

925
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:47,356
Did I not tell him to shut up
or I'll kill him?

926
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:52,094
Do not speak in my presence
any more.

927
00:58:52,096 --> 00:58:53,829
Find Ken.

928
00:58:53,831 --> 00:58:56,698
Then your life
depends on him finding Sameer.

929
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,968
And you,
call me when it's an order.

930
00:59:04,341 --> 00:59:05,541
Or a text.

931
00:59:05,543 --> 00:59:08,143
Shoot me a text.

932
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:10,279
Go.

933
00:59:34,838 --> 00:59:36,438
Aren't you tired?

934
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:40,842
I haven't pulled an all-nighter
in a long time, you know?

935
00:59:40,844 --> 00:59:42,511
If you want to take off
and get some rest,

936
00:59:42,513 --> 00:59:45,581
it's cool with me if you don't
mind walking or taking a bus.

937
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,986
All right.

938
00:59:57,561 --> 00:59:59,227
Hey, listen, man.

939
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:01,463
Um, I don't know what you're
planning on doing now, but I...

940
01:00:01,465 --> 01:00:06,468
I don't think I can help you
find that other guy for Carl.

941
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:09,972
I-I didn't expect this job
to be like this.

942
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:18,914
- Hello?
- Kenny, my man.

943
01:00:18,916 --> 01:00:20,349
Excellent work last night.

944
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:22,217
My pops sent over Doe
with the payment.

945
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:24,820
I hope Tomas's fan
won't be too hard to find.

946
01:00:24,822 --> 01:00:26,388
Yeah, shouldn't be a problem.

947
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:27,422
Great.

948
01:00:27,424 --> 01:00:28,624
Okay, thank you.

949
01:00:28,626 --> 01:00:32,561
No, thank you.

950
01:00:32,563 --> 01:00:36,064
Carl put double payment
in my drop box.

951
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:38,333
You won't have
to worry about rent for months.

952
01:00:41,205 --> 01:00:42,437
What?

953
01:00:42,439 --> 01:00:45,907
I just... I don't know
how I feel about that.

954
01:00:45,909 --> 01:00:48,710
What happened
to honorable judge Josh?

955
01:00:48,712 --> 01:00:51,113
Didn't Tomas deserve this?

956
01:00:51,115 --> 01:00:52,714
Doesn't Sameer deserve his, too?

957
01:00:52,716 --> 01:00:54,149
Because... yeah,

958
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:55,684
I said that people
should choose their friends

959
01:00:55,686 --> 01:00:57,552
better if their friends
get them into trouble,

960
01:00:57,554 --> 01:01:01,456
but I don't want somebody
to die just to prove my point.

961
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:05,260
I don't want
anybody dying for anything.

962
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:07,162
I mean, maybe to you, Stan,
and Nick,

963
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:08,864
this is like normal everyday...

964
01:01:08,866 --> 01:01:12,234
this isn't normal for me, okay?

965
01:01:12,236 --> 01:01:13,635
I've been doing this
for a few years now,

966
01:01:13,637 --> 01:01:16,138
and besides Carl's guys
roughing up a few people

967
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:17,606
here and there,
the worst I've ever seen

968
01:01:17,608 --> 01:01:19,975
is some property damage
or a few broken hearts.

969
01:01:19,977 --> 01:01:22,577
Everything else was for show.

970
01:01:22,579 --> 01:01:24,379
All the clients Nick
and I've had,

971
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:27,683
talking about getting back
at people,

972
01:01:27,685 --> 01:01:29,284
nothing has ever gone this far.

973
01:01:29,286 --> 01:01:32,254
Well, that's what I'm saying,
man, I just...

974
01:01:32,256 --> 01:01:34,856
I don't think I could continue
this case with you

975
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:39,027
if it's gonna go that far.

976
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:41,196
Well, me neither.

977
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:43,498
I get what you're saying.

978
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,834
I just feel like if I
don't get to Sameer first,

979
01:01:45,836 --> 01:01:47,936
somebody else will.

980
01:01:47,938 --> 01:01:51,740
So, if you want to help,

981
01:01:51,742 --> 01:01:53,442
I could use it.

982
01:01:53,444 --> 01:01:56,044
But if not, hey, I understand.

983
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:04,052
All right, wait, wait, wait.

984
01:02:22,539 --> 01:02:24,806
Hey, come see this.

985
01:02:24,808 --> 01:02:29,678
The death of Tomas de la Cruz.

986
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,379
In the life after death...

987
01:02:31,381 --> 01:02:33,315
Hey, guys. What's going on?

988
01:02:33,317 --> 01:02:35,183
Hey, I'm just showing her
this guy's web blogs.

989
01:02:35,185 --> 01:02:36,485
He's supposedly an action star

990
01:02:36,487 --> 01:02:38,053
from the middle east
or something.

991
01:02:38,055 --> 01:02:39,821
And he's all depressed
about his idol's murder.

992
01:02:39,823 --> 01:02:40,822
It's got to be a joke.

993
01:02:40,824 --> 01:02:42,090
My friend worked as a P.A.

994
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:43,725
On an indie film this guy
was a star of,

995
01:02:43,727 --> 01:02:46,228
and he supposedly fought on-set
with his own stunt double.

996
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,496
- Really?
- Yeah.

997
01:02:47,498 --> 01:02:48,730
Do you want to see
him talk about it?

998
01:02:48,732 --> 01:02:50,165
- It's hilarious.
- Yeah.

999
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:51,833
Actually, does he have
any contact information

1000
01:02:51,835 --> 01:02:53,835
on his channel?

1001
01:02:53,837 --> 01:02:56,671
They're gonna be my road hunt.

1002
01:02:59,376 --> 01:03:03,211
So, again, for the camera,
if you don't mind.

1003
01:03:03,213 --> 01:03:07,249
Okay, after doing a long set

1004
01:03:07,251 --> 01:03:09,651
of some fight choreography
that I did.

1005
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:11,052
So I walk off and...

1006
01:03:11,054 --> 01:03:13,588
And I'm going straight
to grab my water bottle,

1007
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:14,723
and here he comes...

1008
01:03:14,725 --> 01:03:17,759
David... walks straight up
with an attitude.

1009
01:03:17,761 --> 01:03:19,161
Walking, he looks at me

1010
01:03:19,163 --> 01:03:21,797
and he goes...

1011
01:03:28,272 --> 01:03:30,205
And he does these faces.

1012
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:33,575
And I'm wondering,
"why you want to do that, bro?

1013
01:03:33,577 --> 01:03:35,844
Come on,
this is professional work."

1014
01:03:35,846 --> 01:03:37,179
Anyhow, so I let it go

1015
01:03:37,181 --> 01:03:38,747
because I'm a bigger man
than that.

1016
01:03:38,749 --> 01:03:41,183
We have to find this guy David
and bring him in here.

1017
01:03:42,886 --> 01:03:44,319
Hey.

1018
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:46,421
And I just kind of pushed
him to congratulate him.

1019
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:48,623
Yeah, can you get me
some information on the stuntman

1020
01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:52,494
named David Palatnikov?
Yeah. Thanks.

1021
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:54,196
Drinking my water,
minding my own business,

1022
01:03:54,198 --> 01:03:57,098
and after the set is done,
he walks up, right?

1023
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:01,369
And... and he's walking towards
me still with an attitude.

1024
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:02,871
Are you out of your damn mind,
son?

1025
01:04:02,873 --> 01:04:05,140
You don't get your hands dirty.
Call him now!

1026
01:04:05,142 --> 01:04:07,042
All right, all right!

1027
01:04:07,044 --> 01:04:10,312
Just really creeps me out.

1028
01:04:10,314 --> 01:04:12,514
He wants me to call Kyle.

1029
01:04:12,516 --> 01:04:14,783
Yeah, I know.
Creeps me out, too.

1030
01:04:34,404 --> 01:04:37,906
Hey, Sam. How's your dad?

1031
01:04:37,908 --> 01:04:40,475
Hey, at least we tried, right?

1032
01:04:40,477 --> 01:04:43,511
We can't find Sameer,
maybe nobody else can.

1033
01:04:43,513 --> 01:04:46,081
Yeah, maybe he left town
or something.

1034
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:48,183
Yeah.

1035
01:04:53,257 --> 01:04:54,789
Got to take a piss.

1036
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:58,393
Welcome back to "celebrity
action rehab live!"

1037
01:04:58,395 --> 01:04:59,861
Good afternoon, everyone.

1038
01:04:59,863 --> 01:05:02,797
I'd like to welcome
Sameer Yousef to our group.

1039
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:07,669
It'd be great if we could all
begin with a brief introduction.

1040
01:05:07,671 --> 01:05:10,372
Yeah, I'm Jimmy,

1041
01:05:10,374 --> 01:05:14,009
and this is Moe Moe.

1042
01:05:14,011 --> 01:05:16,111
Sorry, I need the music
for my rage.

1043
01:05:16,113 --> 01:05:18,146
No problem. Nice to meet you.

1044
01:05:18,148 --> 01:05:20,148
So, what brought you here?

1045
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:21,950
Samantha,
can you just say "hello"

1046
01:05:21,952 --> 01:05:23,919
and tell him your name?

1047
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:25,387
Hello.

1048
01:05:25,389 --> 01:05:28,156
And, uh, he just said my name.

1049
01:05:28,158 --> 01:05:29,691
Hello.

1050
01:05:29,693 --> 01:05:33,128
Sameer, would you care
to share your story with us?

1051
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:36,231
Sure. Um...

1052
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:43,505
He actually got on that show.

1053
01:05:43,507 --> 01:05:45,740
It's not gonna take long
for Carl's guys to find him.

1054
01:05:45,742 --> 01:05:46,908
Okay.

1055
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:47,876
Can we stop at a bullet store
on the way?

1056
01:05:47,878 --> 01:05:49,744
Not now.

1057
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:56,184
Let me make a call real quick.

1058
01:05:56,186 --> 01:05:58,053
Hey, Stan.
Yeah, we found the guy.

1059
01:05:58,055 --> 01:05:59,888
Are you still down? Okay.

1060
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:01,389
Thanks, man.

1061
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:03,191
- What's up?
- I told him back in the diner

1062
01:06:03,193 --> 01:06:04,459
that we're gonna
go after Sameer.

1063
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:06,695
So, what,
he's gonna back us up now?

1064
01:06:06,697 --> 01:06:09,130
Sort of.

1065
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:12,934
Did you meditate today?

1066
01:06:12,936 --> 01:06:14,402
Yeah, it's good.

1067
01:06:14,404 --> 01:06:16,805
No one was around, so I, uh,
popped in my jet Li DVDs

1068
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:19,341
and just lathered up
with some oil

1069
01:06:19,343 --> 01:06:21,476
and just really relaxed.

1070
01:06:23,814 --> 01:06:25,113
Hello?

1071
01:06:25,115 --> 01:06:27,716
Hi, this is David Palatnikov.
I got your message.

1072
01:06:27,718 --> 01:06:29,551
I believe you have some work
for me.

1073
01:06:29,553 --> 01:06:30,986
David.

1074
01:06:30,988 --> 01:06:33,588
Is it possible for you to meet
us at the shooting location?

1075
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:35,190
I'll text you the address.

1076
01:06:35,192 --> 01:06:36,791
Okay, yeah. I'll head on over.

1077
01:06:36,793 --> 01:06:37,926
Thank you.

1078
01:06:37,928 --> 01:06:39,794
Great.

1079
01:06:58,415 --> 01:07:00,215
- Yep?
- Hey, Mike.

1080
01:07:00,217 --> 01:07:02,217
- Yep?
- I have a David Palatnikov

1081
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:04,019
coming over there right now.

1082
01:07:04,021 --> 01:07:07,288
I need you to get a camera
on him and on Sameer asap.

1083
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:09,457
- You got it.
- Okay.

1084
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:15,597
- Hey.
- So, good stuff so far today?

1085
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:19,334
I got some hilarious footage
of the new guy.

1086
01:07:19,336 --> 01:07:21,036
Awesome. Thank you.

1087
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:22,771
I'm gonna go welcome David
to the house.

1088
01:07:22,773 --> 01:07:25,473
He should be here any minute.
I'm ready for him.

1089
01:07:25,475 --> 01:07:26,541
I'll send him
in when he gets here.

1090
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:28,243
Okay, sounds good.

1091
01:07:28,245 --> 01:07:30,445
And make sure that Mike
has a new tape.

1092
01:07:30,447 --> 01:07:32,680
- I just did that.
- Is Dr. Derek around?

1093
01:07:32,682 --> 01:07:35,016
No, he just left. He probably
won't be back for a while.

1094
01:07:35,018 --> 01:07:36,251
Okay, good.

1095
01:07:36,253 --> 01:07:38,119
I need you to keep an eye out
for him.

1096
01:07:38,121 --> 01:07:39,754
And if he comes back any sooner,

1097
01:07:39,756 --> 01:07:41,256
we might need to stall him.
Okay.

1098
01:07:41,258 --> 01:07:42,791
I can do that.

1099
01:07:42,793 --> 01:07:43,725
Oh, hey, Marty.

1100
01:07:47,697 --> 01:07:52,267
I mean, you guys
have seen "fist of won," right?

1101
01:07:52,269 --> 01:07:55,403
It's Tomas de la Cruz's
best movie, man.

1102
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:56,471
Yeah, keep going, man.

1103
01:07:56,473 --> 01:07:57,939
I'm listening.

1104
01:07:57,941 --> 01:08:00,108
And I really don't know
why people keep giving me

1105
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:02,710
a hard time for loving the guy.

1106
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:04,412
I just want to carry on
his legacy.

1107
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:07,816
I mean, he made amazing
action movies...

1108
01:08:08,952 --> 01:08:12,654
So, I did meet the guy...
Which was crazy.

1109
01:08:12,656 --> 01:08:14,456
Next thing I know, he's dead.

1110
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:16,391
And the woman
who contacted me said she wants

1111
01:08:16,393 --> 01:08:18,493
me to be on this show
to pay tribute to him,

1112
01:08:18,495 --> 01:08:20,728
but I haven't had the chance
to do so yet.

1113
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:23,765
And I still don't know
why I'm here.

1114
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:27,402
But I do like that you guys
do listen to me.

1115
01:08:27,404 --> 01:08:29,237
Yeah, man.
It's what we're here for.

1116
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:33,174
Thank you, man.

1117
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:40,915
Because he always
forgets that, too.

1118
01:08:40,917 --> 01:08:42,717
And don't worry
about calling for Marty

1119
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,552
unless there's a real problem.

1120
01:08:44,554 --> 01:08:46,955
We need to let Mike
get enough footage of David

1121
01:08:46,957 --> 01:08:48,256
and Sameer's reunion.

1122
01:08:48,258 --> 01:08:50,558
I got to go. David's here.

1123
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:53,728
This is gonna be great.

1124
01:08:56,032 --> 01:08:57,365
Hi, I'm David.

1125
01:08:57,367 --> 01:08:59,367
Amera sent me here
to work on a project.

1126
01:08:59,369 --> 01:09:01,136
- Come on in.
- All right.

1127
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:07,775
We got to get in
before the gate closes.

1128
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:14,883
Just park
where you see the other cars

1129
01:09:14,885 --> 01:09:16,451
and take the path
up to the house.

1130
01:09:16,453 --> 01:09:20,155
Hey, uh...

1131
01:09:20,157 --> 01:09:22,924
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is private property.

1132
01:09:22,926 --> 01:09:23,892
You need to leave.

1133
01:09:23,894 --> 01:09:26,661
Yeah, we need to get in there.

1134
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:28,897
Um... Want to help me here, man?

1135
01:09:35,772 --> 01:09:37,605
There's a guy in your cast

1136
01:09:37,607 --> 01:09:39,174
or whatever you call it...
He's in there

1137
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:40,842
and he's in some big trouble
with some very bad people.

1138
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:42,410
We're just gonna go in and...

1139
01:09:42,412 --> 01:09:46,848
everyone here is probably
in trouble with bad people.

1140
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:55,790
Allow the music to soothe you.

1141
01:09:55,792 --> 01:10:00,361
He pretended he didn't
Tomas de la Cruz.

1142
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:02,730
I wanted to test my stunt double

1143
01:10:02,732 --> 01:10:06,267
to see if he's capable
of doing this difficult move.

1144
01:10:06,269 --> 01:10:08,736
You know how it is, right?

1145
01:10:25,355 --> 01:10:26,988
Why are we wasting time?

1146
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:28,389
Let's... look,
we're gonna go in.

1147
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:29,490
You can do
what ever you need to.

1148
01:10:29,492 --> 01:10:32,694
No. No, I don't think so.

1149
01:10:32,696 --> 01:10:36,030
Marty?
Can you come down here, please?

1150
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:46,474
Let's just jump this fence.

1151
01:11:07,897 --> 01:11:09,230
Hell no.

1152
01:11:09,232 --> 01:11:12,166
You ruined my career and now
you're here to rub it in?

1153
01:11:20,543 --> 01:11:23,678
Beginner moves.

1154
01:11:26,283 --> 01:11:27,749
Who are you guys?

1155
01:11:27,751 --> 01:11:29,684
- We're friends of Tomas.
- What?

1156
01:11:29,686 --> 01:11:33,021
Well, the last ones to hang out
with him, anyway.

1157
01:11:33,023 --> 01:11:35,156
He was a real asshole,
wasn't he?

1158
01:11:35,158 --> 01:11:38,693
Any enemy of Tomas
is an enemy of mine.

1159
01:11:41,898 --> 01:11:43,498
Sameer?

1160
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,600
Everything all right?

1161
01:11:49,706 --> 01:11:53,074
As rage becomes calm...

1162
01:11:53,076 --> 01:11:55,243
Get his legs.

1163
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:07,855
Hey, Sameer?

1164
01:12:11,628 --> 01:12:13,661
What is that? A stick?

1165
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:15,697
Yeah. That's gonna hurt.

1166
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,167
- You go first.
- Me?

1167
01:12:19,169 --> 01:12:20,968
You're the one
that wanted to come in.

1168
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:40,221
Gonna say something?

1169
01:12:40,223 --> 01:12:42,724
There's somebody in that house
who could be in a lot of trouble

1170
01:12:42,726 --> 01:12:44,559
very soon.

1171
01:12:44,561 --> 01:12:46,327
We just want to help him out.

1172
01:13:27,036 --> 01:13:30,805
Man, what is...
What's going on down here?

1173
01:13:39,549 --> 01:13:42,750
Hey, Marty? You might want to
come up here soon.

1174
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:45,253
- He's busy, Mike.
- Okay, whatever.

1175
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:49,857
Relax and...

1176
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:00,928
no!

1177
01:15:24,821 --> 01:15:28,322
Moe Moe! No!

1178
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:34,161
Let me go. Fight me one-on-one.

1179
01:15:43,673 --> 01:15:46,073
David! David! Help me out, man.

1180
01:15:46,075 --> 01:15:48,776
I'll handle these fools.

1181
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:26,414
I got him! Get the guns!
Get the guns!

1182
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:34,121
Hit him, don't shoot him!
Hit him! Hit him!

1183
01:16:38,328 --> 01:16:41,495
His head broke your...
Broke your gun.

1184
01:16:41,497 --> 01:16:44,065
What'd you use my gun for?

1185
01:16:44,067 --> 01:16:46,500
I don't know, how am I
supposed to know which gun...

1186
01:16:46,502 --> 01:16:47,802
you're the one...

1187
01:16:47,804 --> 01:16:49,236
can't I put your bullets
in my gun?

1188
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:51,138
No.

1189
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:56,010
You all right, man?

1190
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:03,117
Hey, man. Are you all right?

1191
01:17:04,487 --> 01:17:06,120
Wait, where'd he go?

1192
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:08,022
Oh, those two guys
you were fighting

1193
01:17:08,024 --> 01:17:10,157
just wrapped him up in a carpet
and took off.

1194
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:13,260
- When?
- Just now.

1195
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:22,536
What the...

1196
01:17:33,516 --> 01:17:34,949
Hey. Hey, man.

1197
01:17:34,951 --> 01:17:36,484
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1198
01:17:36,486 --> 01:17:38,653
Two guys in black.
They took someone.

1199
01:17:38,655 --> 01:17:40,554
Ah, let me guess who.

1200
01:17:40,556 --> 01:17:42,590
- Sameer?
- Yeah.

1201
01:17:42,592 --> 01:17:43,891
How'd you know?

1202
01:17:43,893 --> 01:17:45,159
Man, how'd he get by us?

1203
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:46,861
Is there like a back road
or something?

1204
01:17:46,863 --> 01:17:48,429
Well, let's go. Come on.

1205
01:17:48,431 --> 01:17:50,931
All right.

1206
01:17:50,933 --> 01:17:52,266
So, where we gonna go?

1207
01:17:52,268 --> 01:17:53,601
I mean, there's no car
to follow, so...

1208
01:17:53,603 --> 01:17:55,202
Carl usually takes people
to this factory,

1209
01:17:55,204 --> 01:17:57,438
so I think
we should try there first.

1210
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,674
Hey, man, you sure you want to
come with us?

1211
01:18:02,578 --> 01:18:04,445
All right.

1212
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:51,158
No, it's my dad.

1213
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:53,661
He's giving me a bunch
of crap about my jacket.

1214
01:19:00,169 --> 01:19:02,903
Yeah, the blue one.

1215
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:05,005
No, I know.
It's my favorite one.

1216
01:19:09,712 --> 01:19:12,580
Hey, I got to go. All right.

1217
01:19:12,582 --> 01:19:15,249
Bye.

1218
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:18,018
Hey, there, sunshine.

1219
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:20,521
Welcome back.

1220
01:19:20,523 --> 01:19:23,157
Why does everybody do that?
You're tied up.

1221
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:25,025
We're standing right in front
of you.

1222
01:19:25,027 --> 01:19:26,460
What's all the struggling about?

1223
01:19:26,462 --> 01:19:28,229
If you so much
as loosen anything or even try,

1224
01:19:28,231 --> 01:19:30,731
I'm just gonna have these guys
beat the crap out of you.

1225
01:19:33,669 --> 01:19:35,169
Whoa.

1226
01:19:35,171 --> 01:19:37,071
What are those?

1227
01:19:37,073 --> 01:19:38,606
Which one of those goes
into his eye?

1228
01:19:42,211 --> 01:19:43,944
Now, see, here's the thing...

1229
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:46,413
Your boy, Tomas,

1230
01:19:46,415 --> 01:19:48,783
he owed my dad a pretty penny.

1231
01:19:48,785 --> 01:19:54,155
But someone couldn't collect
before stabbing him.

1232
01:20:01,764 --> 01:20:03,497
He's talking with the tape
on his mouth.

1233
01:20:03,499 --> 01:20:07,067
You see what I mean?
This could be very frustrating.

1234
01:20:07,069 --> 01:20:10,671
Take it off.

1235
01:20:10,673 --> 01:20:14,575
Aah! Aah!

1236
01:20:14,577 --> 01:20:15,609
Aah!

1237
01:20:15,611 --> 01:20:17,178
Aah!

1238
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:19,246
You think that hurts?

1239
01:20:19,248 --> 01:20:21,081
Untie me now.

1240
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:23,150
Fight me like real men.

1241
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:24,285
Why are you trying...

1242
01:20:24,287 --> 01:20:26,787
Listen, my boys

1243
01:20:26,789 --> 01:20:29,023
saw Tomas give you something

1244
01:20:29,025 --> 01:20:31,025
and then you disappeared.

1245
01:20:31,027 --> 01:20:32,426
So now, unfortunately,

1246
01:20:32,428 --> 01:20:35,362
you're stuck
holding your friend's bill.

1247
01:20:35,364 --> 01:20:36,730
We're gonna start the collection

1248
01:20:36,732 --> 01:20:40,501
with whatever it is
Tomas gave you.

1249
01:20:40,503 --> 01:20:43,337
Tomas would have never
given out his autograph

1250
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:46,440
to anyone like you.

1251
01:20:46,442 --> 01:20:48,042
Wow.

1252
01:20:48,044 --> 01:20:50,110
This guy's a lunatic.

1253
01:20:50,112 --> 01:20:52,179
You know, put the tape back on.

1254
01:20:56,652 --> 01:20:58,219
Can you put something sharp
in his face?

1255
01:20:58,221 --> 01:21:00,187
Maybe speed this process
up a little bit?

1256
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:02,289
See what we have to put up with

1257
01:21:02,291 --> 01:21:04,325
because you
can't control yourself?

1258
01:21:04,327 --> 01:21:05,993
Now, this fools
out here all by himself,

1259
01:21:05,995 --> 01:21:08,729
too stupid to understand that...

1260
01:21:08,731 --> 01:21:10,865
Ken?

1261
01:21:10,867 --> 01:21:12,266
Come on, Sam.

1262
01:21:12,268 --> 01:21:13,734
He had nothing
to do with Tomas's debt.

1263
01:21:13,736 --> 01:21:15,402
He was just at the wrong place
at the wrong...

1264
01:21:15,404 --> 01:21:18,973
when did you start
caring so much?

1265
01:21:18,975 --> 01:21:22,743
Ah. Nick's substitute.

1266
01:21:22,745 --> 01:21:24,078
You know, Kenny?

1267
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,946
You better walk away right now
and live with the fact

1268
01:21:25,948 --> 01:21:28,616
that I'm gonna be giving you
some very negative reviews

1269
01:21:28,618 --> 01:21:30,517
online, pal.

1270
01:21:32,321 --> 01:21:35,723
Who the hell is this guy?

1271
01:21:35,725 --> 01:21:38,592
So you gonna let him go?

1272
01:21:38,594 --> 01:21:43,597
Private investigator turned
superhero... Ken Champaco.

1273
01:21:43,599 --> 01:21:46,000
No, you know what? Shoot him.

1274
01:21:46,002 --> 01:21:47,801
All of them.

1275
01:22:00,116 --> 01:22:01,348
Seriously?

1276
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:03,250
Neither of you guys
are carrying?

1277
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:04,818
'Cause you know I don't.

1278
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:08,489
This guy just brought a bucket
of tools, some plastic,

1279
01:22:08,491 --> 01:22:09,790
had enough room for a chair,

1280
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:11,425
but no gun?

1281
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:15,362
I see now why you guys have been
doing my dad's bitch work.

1282
01:22:15,364 --> 01:22:19,199
Now would be an excellent time
to redeem yourself.

1283
01:22:29,745 --> 01:22:32,379
Now hurry this up.
I'll just be a minute.

1284
01:24:54,323 --> 01:24:56,023
Not bad...

1285
01:24:56,025 --> 01:24:58,025
For a fat guy.

1286
01:26:10,566 --> 01:26:12,666
You're still fat.

1287
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:47,247
Come on. Hit me.

1288
01:30:32,661 --> 01:30:34,961
Ha!

1289
01:31:09,264 --> 01:31:12,699
Aah!

1290
01:31:17,105 --> 01:31:18,705
Where's the rest of them, man?

1291
01:31:18,707 --> 01:31:20,607
We got them. We got them.

1292
01:31:20,609 --> 01:31:23,009
Can you check on him?

1293
01:31:29,551 --> 01:31:31,985
Please? All right.

1294
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:51,271
So what do we do now?

1295
01:31:51,273 --> 01:31:53,540
Carl's obviously gonna come
after us,

1296
01:31:53,542 --> 01:31:56,176
and then him and then David.

1297
01:31:56,178 --> 01:31:57,744
I think we should wait
to hear from Stan.

1298
01:31:57,746 --> 01:32:00,113
Yeah, where is Stan?
What is he doing?

1299
01:32:00,115 --> 01:32:02,782
Aargh!

1300
01:32:04,586 --> 01:32:06,887
All right, so,
since I know every piece of shit

1301
01:32:06,889 --> 01:32:08,555
that you're gonna hire to go
after me and my buddies,

1302
01:32:08,557 --> 01:32:11,491
I think it's safe to assume
that we're done here, right?

1303
01:32:11,493 --> 01:32:13,326
Don't you know
what kind of movie this is?

1304
01:32:13,328 --> 01:32:16,363
First you finish him,
then we fight.

1305
01:32:16,365 --> 01:32:17,964
- Cheap shot.
- What did you say?

1306
01:32:17,966 --> 01:32:20,734
I said, "cheap shot."
I wasn't ready.

1307
01:32:20,736 --> 01:32:22,702
I was gonna kick you ass.
Oh, would you?

1308
01:32:22,704 --> 01:32:25,305
Yeah.

1309
01:32:25,307 --> 01:32:28,341
Let's go!

1310
01:32:28,343 --> 01:32:30,777
Argh!

1311
01:32:32,614 --> 01:32:35,048
Argh!

1312
01:32:38,153 --> 01:32:40,086
Argh!

1313
01:32:42,758 --> 01:32:44,991
Argh!

1314
01:32:48,597 --> 01:32:50,497
Aah!

1315
01:32:52,501 --> 01:32:54,134
Argh!

1316
01:32:57,339 --> 01:33:00,006
Argh!

1317
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:06,846
All right.

1318
01:33:06,848 --> 01:33:08,381
All right, and then push me.

1319
01:34:20,889 --> 01:34:23,123
Watch it.

1320
01:34:26,294 --> 01:34:30,764
Lucas is gonna
fall outside the window

1321
01:34:30,766 --> 01:34:34,067
into these boxes and mats.

1322
01:34:38,306 --> 01:34:41,007
What?

1323
01:34:41,009 --> 01:34:44,644
I'm just gonna kick his ass.

1324
01:35:16,545 --> 01:35:19,179
Action.

1325
01:35:19,181 --> 01:35:22,482
And one, two, three.

1326
01:35:32,627 --> 01:35:34,728
Cut!

1327
01:35:49,678 --> 01:35:51,745
Good shot, good shot.

1328
01:35:51,747 --> 01:35:53,413
Oh, man.

1329
01:36:11,466 --> 01:36:14,567
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Oh, shit! Sorry.

1330
01:36:20,108 --> 01:36:22,275
Now you gotta trip him.

1331
01:36:34,923 --> 01:36:36,489
Oh, shit.

1332
01:36:45,767 --> 01:36:48,034
Nice, man.

1333
01:36:57,579 --> 01:36:59,579
You all right?

1334
01:37:17,532 --> 01:37:19,599
Sorry.

1335
01:37:23,104 --> 01:37:24,504
Let's go, man.

1336
01:38:22,697 --> 01:38:24,230
Cut.

1337
01:38:27,302 --> 01:38:29,469
- Ready?
- Yeah, you?

1338
01:38:29,471 --> 01:38:31,237
Yeah.

1339
01:38:35,310 --> 01:38:37,777
Last time.

1340
01:38:40,148 --> 01:38:42,315
I'm gonna get a sandwich.

1341
01:38:43,318 --> 01:38:46,252
Oh, hit cut.

1342
01:38:47,689 --> 01:38:50,256
Hey, Nick, remember that thing
I was telling you about?

1343
01:38:50,258 --> 01:38:52,191
You know, like, back in '84?
Uh... No.

1344
01:38:52,193 --> 01:38:55,595
- Weren't you a baby?
- There it is.

1345
01:38:57,098 --> 01:38:58,932
I don't know man.

1346
01:38:58,934 --> 01:39:00,300
I still want to be a p.I.

1347
01:39:00,302 --> 01:39:02,201
You know, I got a kid now.

1348
01:39:02,203 --> 01:39:04,237
So, what,
you want to buy a taco truck?

1349
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:06,706
Who's gonna run it?
I can cook, man.

1350
01:39:06,708 --> 01:39:09,008
Okay. I can't.

1351
01:39:09,010 --> 01:39:11,110
Can you ride a skateboard?
