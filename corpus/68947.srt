00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:21,073
Hi. Checking out.
Fourteen, three, twenty-two.

2
00:03:23,701 --> 00:03:25,703
- Mr. Shaffer?
- That’s me.

3
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:30,124
- I have your bill right here.
- Thank you.

4
00:03:30,624 --> 00:03:34,753
- So, how was your luck last night?
- Oh, I don't... I didn't gamble.

5
00:03:34,962 --> 00:03:38,674
I was just here for a friend's
bachelor party. He's the gambler.

6
00:03:42,136 --> 00:03:47,558
- Excuse me, what’s these $ 110?
- Those are your in-room movies.

7
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:51,270
- No, I didn't watch any movies.
- Okay. Let’s see.

8
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:54,273
"Afro Whores".

9
00:03:54,481 --> 00:03:58,861
- "Afro Whores"?
- You watched it... 11 times.

10
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:05,868
- No, no, wait...
- "Afro Whores" 2:30, 4:00 and 5:30.

11
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:11,373
Watched "The Grinch" for 10 minutes
then switched back to "Afro Whores".

12
00:04:11,582 --> 00:04:15,628
I didn't watch it. It was a bachelor
party. There were 35 people there.

13
00:04:15,836 --> 00:04:18,631
You can ask any of them.
You have to take that off my record.

14
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,633
It 's not a record, sir.

15
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:22,676
- It 's a delete.
- Okay, fine.

16
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:27,097
- How many times did you watch it?
- None. I didn't watch it.

17
00:04:27,306 --> 00:04:33,646
Are you sure? "Sizzling backdoor
action with 2 sexy soul sisters."

18
00:04:33,854 --> 00:04:36,565
No! I don't need to know what
it 's about! I did not watch it!

19
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:40,319
I didn't!

20
00:04:57,711 --> 00:04:58,837
Miss?

21
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:01,840
Can I have another one
of these, please?

22
00:05:02,883 --> 00:05:05,803
Oh, sorry.
I thought you were a woman.

23
00:05:06,136 --> 00:05:08,222
I am a woman.

24
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:14,770
- You look kind of familiar.
- Yeah, you do.

25
00:05:16,313 --> 00:05:20,359
I get that all the time. I guess
I just have one of those faces.

26
00:05:20,568 --> 00:05:24,280
And now for our Loser Of The Week.
This week it's a no-brainer.

27
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,868
Templeton made the biggest bonehead
call in the history of football.

28
00:05:29,076 --> 00:05:32,913
It happened last Sunday at Dallas
with the score tied at 10.

29
00:05:33,122 --> 00:05:36,709
They were headed towards overtime.
They were about to toss the coin...

30
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:39,295
...to see who'd kick off.
- Dallas. Call it in the air.

31
00:05:39,503 --> 00:05:42,381
- Tails.
- That's heads!

32
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,301
- What? That's tails, man!
- No, no, no. It's...

33
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:48,637
- That was tails.
- No, it was... hang on. It's...

34
00:05:48,846 --> 00:05:51,599
- Now, what did I say?
- You said Heads.

35
00:05:51,807 --> 00:05:54,435
Heads! Yeah! Heads!

36
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:02,568
Okay, little brother,
just be cool.

37
00:06:02,776 --> 00:06:04,361
Just be cool.

38
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:20,794
Okay, this is it.
See the glass?

39
00:06:21,462 --> 00:06:25,132
Walk across the lobby, slip on
the glass, let gravity to the rest.

40
00:06:26,425 --> 00:06:28,093
I can break my neck.

41
00:06:28,636 --> 00:06:32,181
It 's true. You could break your neck.
It 's a risk I'm willing to take.

42
00:06:32,473 --> 00:06:34,642
Why don't you do it?

43
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:38,229
Because, Einstein, one of us
needs to be the victim and...

44
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:42,608
one of us needs to be the witness.
What kind of witness would you make?

45
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:46,904
I'm your brother. I don't know what
you're saying. How's your tongue?

46
00:06:50,658 --> 00:06:52,451
How does it look?

47
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,372
Looks good.
It looks much better.

48
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,794
Okay, here we go.
We're on candid camera so...

49
00:07:02,503 --> 00:07:04,255
make it look good.

50
00:07:15,724 --> 00:07:19,395
Excuse me. I'm a lawyer, Gloria
Allred. What the hell happened here?

51
00:07:19,603 --> 00:07:23,774
- She slipped on that glass.
- Those jerks will pay for this.

52
00:07:23,983 --> 00:07:28,153
They'll pay through the nose.
I've never seen such negligence.

53
00:07:28,362 --> 00:07:29,989
This is going to be huge.

54
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,452
- She's an angel.
- What a cute little face.

55
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:38,539
- She's absolutely beautiful.
- She has your eyes.

56
00:07:38,706 --> 00:07:42,501
It 's the only picture I have. It 's
worn out, I'm always looking at it.

57
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,505
- You haven't seen her for 27 years?
- No, not till today.

58
00:07:46,714 --> 00:07:49,717
- She called you out of the blue?
- No, I found her.

59
00:07:49,925 --> 00:07:54,179
I hired a detective, I spent all my
money and now we're going to meet.

60
00:07:54,388 --> 00:07:57,600
- You think she'll recognize me?
- Of course she will.

61
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:22,416
Vera Baker?

62
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,545
My baby.

63
00:08:29,882 --> 00:08:32,593
Excuse me.
I have to take this.

64
00:08:34,094 --> 00:08:35,888
This is Merrill.

65
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:41,185
That 's unacceptable! Tell Warren
that if we don't ship by Tuesday...

66
00:08:41,393 --> 00:08:44,230
we won't be in the stores by
Mother's Day. That 's unacceptable!

67
00:08:44,438 --> 00:08:46,357
So don't give me
any excuses and do it!

68
00:08:46,607 --> 00:08:49,860
Do it! Just shut up
and get it done!

69
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:55,324
Honey, you broke your phone.

70
00:08:55,824 --> 00:08:58,536
It 's okay.
I carry extras.

71
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:04,375
Why don't we sit down?

72
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:16,428
You probably have
a thousand questions for me.

73
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:21,976
I was young. I didn't tell
anybody I was pregnant.

74
00:09:22,142 --> 00:09:25,187
And I felt I could
handle it at the time.

75
00:09:25,396 --> 00:09:26,730
Hi.

76
00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:30,150
Could you just pull yourselves
together and bring us a drink?

77
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,321
- Sure.
- Sure, but what would you like?

78
00:09:34,738 --> 00:09:36,657
- Mimosa.
- Mimosa.

79
00:09:37,074 --> 00:09:40,160
They both want a Mimosa.

80
00:09:41,036 --> 00:09:42,663
So...

81
00:09:42,872 --> 00:09:46,792
...you sell cosmetics?
- Yeah, I have my own company.

82
00:09:47,626 --> 00:09:49,962
And we're going public.

83
00:09:51,463 --> 00:09:53,632
And you're not married?

84
00:09:54,675 --> 00:09:57,636
- Lucianne said you wouldn't.
- Who?

85
00:09:57,845 --> 00:10:01,432
She's my psychic. She's the one
who told me to come look for you.

86
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,893
She said you needed me.

87
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:06,854
- She did?
- She said you were lonely...

88
00:10:07,062 --> 00:10:11,275
that you were worried about money,
and that you had trouble sleeping.

89
00:10:15,946 --> 00:10:17,865
Who the hell isn't?

90
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:29,210
- See? We didn't need a bell man.
- Congratulations, Randy.

91
00:10:29,418 --> 00:10:33,005
- You avoided another tip. Thank you.
- Those nickels and dimes add up.

92
00:10:33,214 --> 00:10:36,383
- I call this bed!
- You got to pick last night!

93
00:10:36,592 --> 00:10:39,220
- Go to hell, Jason!
- Hey, language, please.

94
00:10:39,428 --> 00:10:43,098
Bev, his and her bathrobes!
Look at that view.

95
00:10:43,307 --> 00:10:46,227
- Yeah, nice view.
- Okay, honey.

96
00:10:46,393 --> 00:10:50,689
Why don't you unpack?
I'm just going to go look around.

97
00:10:51,273 --> 00:10:55,236
Wait. You're not going
to the casino?

98
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,072
No, of course not.

99
00:10:58,656 --> 00:11:02,201
You know I just drove from the
Grand Canyon. Gotta stretch my legs.

100
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:06,121
You swore on your mother's eyes.
We're here to see David Copperfield.

101
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,792
- No gambling.
- I'm just looking around.

102
00:11:10,918 --> 00:11:14,547
In fact, I'm going to go
to the gift shop.

103
00:11:15,422 --> 00:11:18,384
- I can jump farther than you!
- I'll see you guys later.

104
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:20,219
Watch!

105
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:25,182
That 's gotta hurt.
Honey, kids need you!

106
00:11:25,516 --> 00:11:27,685
Hey Nick! Nicky!

107
00:11:27,893 --> 00:11:30,062
- You're not leaving.
- I'm in court on Tuesday.

108
00:11:30,271 --> 00:11:33,607
- No, you're not.
- I work for people who are.

109
00:11:33,816 --> 00:11:36,318
You pussy. You can't leave, Nick.
It 's still going on out there.

110
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:40,489
- I have to. I got two hours sleep.
- Cunningham got another stripper.

111
00:11:40,698 --> 00:11:43,659
- You've gotta see this one!
- I can't. I gotta get back.

112
00:11:43,868 --> 00:11:47,079
No you don't, Nick.
I know you, man. You're scared.

113
00:11:47,955 --> 00:11:50,499
You're scared it 's gonna get
out of control and someday...

114
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:54,169
...it will come back to haunt you.
- I'm not having this conversation.

115
00:11:54,378 --> 00:11:58,299
You didn't even gamble. Not one
quarter. That 's no way to live.

116
00:11:58,465 --> 00:12:01,719
In fact, that 's ain't even living.
It 's hiding.

117
00:12:01,927 --> 00:12:04,096
I'm not hiding from anything.

118
00:12:04,305 --> 00:12:09,226
Okay, then prove it. Do something.
Anything. I mean break one rule.

119
00:12:09,435 --> 00:12:11,896
Like... here look, Nick.

120
00:12:12,146 --> 00:12:14,440
Paper.
Come on, take it.

121
00:12:14,815 --> 00:12:17,484
Take it.
Come on, Nick, take it.

122
00:12:22,406 --> 00:12:25,993
I have a plane to catch, okay?
See you in Chicago.

123
00:12:28,913 --> 00:12:32,958
I won! I won! Look at all
the money coming down!

124
00:12:33,334 --> 00:12:35,502
Look...

125
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:40,633
"You're a winner.
See Guest Services."

126
00:12:43,886 --> 00:12:45,429
A Dollar!

127
00:12:49,683 --> 00:12:51,810
Come on, baby, come on!

128
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:12,665
We won!

129
00:13:14,124 --> 00:13:16,502
- We won one.
- What 's this?

130
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:19,380
This isn't money.

131
00:13:37,856 --> 00:13:42,111
- That 's the prize? A free buffet?
- Actually, it 's not a buffet.

132
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:45,781
It 's a special reception at 10:00
in the Penthouse Conference Room.

133
00:13:46,574 --> 00:13:51,287
"Where a spectacular once in a
lifetime opportunity awaits you."

134
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:53,539
And that 's all I know.

135
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:56,292
- What do you think?
- I think it 's some kind of scam.

136
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,169
Oh, good, a scam! We'll do it.

137
00:13:59,378 --> 00:14:02,256
- I'll need to see some ID then.
- Okay.

138
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:17,354
There. I gambled.

139
00:14:23,986 --> 00:14:25,279
A family vacation, huh?

140
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:29,199
You got to savor these moments.
They'll never come around again.

141
00:14:29,408 --> 00:14:31,577
- Exactly.
- Excuse me.

142
00:14:31,785 --> 00:14:35,247
- Do you know what 's going on?
- Free grub, that 's what 's going on.

143
00:14:35,456 --> 00:14:38,626
- This room is fabulous!
- Excuse, me.

144
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:41,212
- Does anybody know why we're here?
- Beats me.

145
00:14:42,963 --> 00:14:46,091
Oh, my God!
You should sue somebody!

146
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:48,802
- I did it myself.
- What?

147
00:14:49,011 --> 00:14:51,388
He said he did it himself.
He sent away for a kit.

148
00:14:51,597 --> 00:14:56,435
I knew I recognized you.
You're the referee. The bonehead.

149
00:14:57,436 --> 00:15:00,481
Well, that 's just the media
blowing it out of proportion.

150
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:04,360
My hairdresser's husband lost
800 dollars because of you.

151
00:15:04,818 --> 00:15:07,446
- Everybody thinks we flip quarters.
- Can I have a picture with you?

152
00:15:07,655 --> 00:15:11,534
- It 's really a commemorative coin.
- Smile!

153
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:15,788
Am I too late?

154
00:15:15,996 --> 00:15:20,417
Look, I won a coin.
A gold coin.

155
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,798
Isn't this wonderful.
Look at this room.

156
00:15:26,006 --> 00:15:30,970
What a beautiful room.
Have you seen this room?

157
00:15:31,345 --> 00:15:33,973
Yes. We're in it.

158
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:41,188
I am Enrico Pollini. Now
I know what you are thinking.

159
00:15:41,397 --> 00:15:44,650
- Enrico is a girl's name.
- No, I wasn't.

160
00:15:44,858 --> 00:15:47,987
- No pun intended.
- What pun is that?

161
00:15:48,195 --> 00:15:51,490
Look, look at all this food.

162
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:54,910
What a beautiful party.

163
00:15:55,953 --> 00:15:58,998
- Little cockdoggies.
- They're called cocktail wienies.

164
00:15:59,415 --> 00:16:04,003
Wienies. I'm so sorry.
My English is not so good.

165
00:16:04,211 --> 00:16:05,838
But I'm learning.

166
00:16:06,797 --> 00:16:11,218
- That 's it. We're out of here.
- Where are we? I just... Bye, y'all!

167
00:16:11,385 --> 00:16:16,098
Excuse me! I'm Donald Sinclair.
I own this hotel.

168
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:21,645
We don't have much time. There's a
meteor the size of North Carolina...

169
00:16:21,854 --> 00:16:24,106
heading straight for earth.

170
00:16:24,773 --> 00:16:29,862
The impact is going to kill
everyone on this planet.

171
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:34,491
I built a bunker in the basement
that can withstand the blast.

172
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,162
There's room for eight people. I've
chosen the seven of you, plus me.

173
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:43,876
When this is over, it will be up
to us to repopulate the planet.

174
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,054
I couldn't resist!

175
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,932
I'm sorry!

176
00:17:00,768 --> 00:17:03,395
A joke. He made a joke.

177
00:17:03,604 --> 00:17:07,650
Sit down, please. Merrill, you and
your mother can sit down over here.

178
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:11,362
- How do you know she's my mother?
- Alas, there are no secrets anymore.

179
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:15,824
Actually, that 's not quite true.
There's one secret. One last secret.

180
00:17:16,617 --> 00:17:19,787
It involves all of you.

181
00:17:21,872 --> 00:17:23,958
I'm getting goose pimples.

182
00:17:26,794 --> 00:17:32,049
Mr. Shaffer. Curiosity got the better
of you. Come and sit down.

183
00:17:32,508 --> 00:17:35,719
- I'm fine, thanks.
- You haven't missed anything.

184
00:17:35,928 --> 00:17:39,807
We were just cutting to the chase.
"Cutting to the chase"!

185
00:17:44,812 --> 00:17:46,689
Well, you'll laugh later.

186
00:17:46,897 --> 00:17:50,568
As you know, the odds against
winning a jackpot downstairs...

187
00:17:50,776 --> 00:17:53,737
or hitting the state lottery are
astronomical. Millions to one.

188
00:17:53,946 --> 00:17:57,074
A serious person doesn't even
bother with it. But today...

189
00:17:57,491 --> 00:18:00,786
you have the chance
to play a game...

190
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:06,417
where the odds of winning
are one in six. One in six.

191
00:18:08,127 --> 00:18:10,212
It 's one throw...

192
00:18:12,256 --> 00:18:13,757
of the dice.

193
00:18:18,512 --> 00:18:21,974
This is my attorney, Mr. Grisham.
Tragically was born...

194
00:18:22,182 --> 00:18:27,980
without personality. He insists that
anyone who wishes participate...

195
00:18:28,188 --> 00:18:29,648
should sign this waiver...

196
00:18:29,857 --> 00:18:35,029
absolving the casino from any
responsibility or damages.

197
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:39,658
So, who do you like, Claude?

198
00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:43,787
The young woman in the black coat.
She looks desperate.

199
00:18:43,996 --> 00:18:48,083
But she has her mother with her.
That could slow her down.

200
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:50,002
- Perhaps.
- Now...

201
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:55,424
563 miles from here, is a little
town called Silver City...

202
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:58,219
...New Mexico.
- Gold Rush.

203
00:18:58,427 --> 00:19:01,263
Quite, right, Nick. Yes,
they struck gold there in 1860.

204
00:19:01,472 --> 00:19:04,141
It was the second largest
gold rush in American history.

205
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:08,896
Very good, Nick.
I think Nick should be our captain.

206
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:15,903
In the downtown Silver City,
there's a train station.

207
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:19,782
As you go into the front door,
there's some lockers on the right.

208
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,784
Do you have the keys?

209
00:19:21,992 --> 00:19:23,869
Six identical keys.

210
00:19:24,495 --> 00:19:26,872
They all open the same locker,
that 's locker...

211
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:32,419
001. Inside the locker,
is a red duffel bag.

212
00:19:32,628 --> 00:19:36,048
Inside the red duffel bag,
is two million dollars.

213
00:19:36,757 --> 00:19:40,803
In cash. Fifties and hundreds.
Makes a pile about... so big.

214
00:19:41,053 --> 00:19:44,014
First one there keeps it all.

215
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:51,855
I put transmitting devices in your
key rings to keep track of you.

216
00:19:52,064 --> 00:19:53,524
That 's it.

217
00:19:54,775 --> 00:19:56,402
Go!

218
00:19:58,487 --> 00:20:01,991
- You can't pick people at random.
- I can do anything I like, Owen.

219
00:20:02,241 --> 00:20:03,951
I'm eccentric.

220
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:08,414
- Go!
- Wait a minute, so it 's like a race?

221
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,919
A race. He said race.
I hope I win.

222
00:20:14,587 --> 00:20:18,007
- What are the rules?
- There's only one rule.

223
00:20:18,215 --> 00:20:20,259
Are you ready?
Here it is.

224
00:20:20,801 --> 00:20:24,221
There are no rules.

225
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,931
Go!

226
00:20:28,142 --> 00:20:31,562
- Go!
- When you say "go"...

227
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,857
you mean...
just "go!"?

228
00:20:35,065 --> 00:20:37,610
Begin. Commence.
Start moving.

229
00:20:37,818 --> 00:20:41,405
Theoretically, you have been racing
for about 40 seconds.

230
00:20:41,614 --> 00:20:44,241
And so far,
Mr. Shaffer is winning...

231
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,119
because he's nearest to the door.

232
00:20:55,002 --> 00:20:56,253
He's crazy!

233
00:20:57,171 --> 00:21:01,091
A race! A race!
You have to pace yourself.

234
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,970
Carbohydrate is important.
Pasta is good.

235
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:08,015
Breathing... is important

236
00:21:09,391 --> 00:21:11,018
Excuse me.

237
00:21:11,936 --> 00:21:13,646
One, two, three...

238
00:21:13,854 --> 00:21:16,315
It 's some sort of joke.
It has to be.

239
00:21:16,565 --> 00:21:19,610
What kind of jackass just
gives away two million dollars?

240
00:21:19,818 --> 00:21:22,321
Maybe it 's a publicity stunt.

241
00:21:22,863 --> 00:21:25,532
What kind of publicity?
He swore us all to secrecy.

242
00:21:25,741 --> 00:21:28,160
Maybe it 's a secret
publicity stunt.

243
00:21:28,452 --> 00:21:30,621
A secret publicity stunt?

244
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:36,043
I don't know what it is, but there's
always an angle. People like him...

245
00:21:36,418 --> 00:21:40,005
make millions of dollars everyday
playing people like us for chumps.

246
00:21:40,214 --> 00:21:42,508
- I'm nobody's chump.
- So, you don't believe he is...?

247
00:21:43,175 --> 00:21:46,345
Eleven-thirty, non-stop to Chicago.
I'm going to be on it.

248
00:21:47,221 --> 00:21:51,684
He's right. I'm not cutting short
my first family vacation...

249
00:21:51,892 --> 00:21:55,020
in three years because of some
half-assed wild goose chase.

250
00:21:55,229 --> 00:21:58,274
Okay, so...
you're not going for it?

251
00:22:00,568 --> 00:22:03,862
- I don't think so.
- Not me.

252
00:22:04,863 --> 00:22:07,283
- So, I guess that 's that.
- Right.

253
00:22:07,741 --> 00:22:11,871
It was nice meeting you. I'll take
the stairs. My room's 2 floors down.

254
00:22:12,746 --> 00:22:14,999
Nice meeting you.
Have a nice vacation.

255
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:25,509
You know it 's probably stuck.

256
00:22:26,135 --> 00:22:28,804
I think I'm going
to take the stairs too.

257
00:22:43,444 --> 00:22:44,820
Come on, Vera!

258
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,422
- Hold the door, please.
- Take your time. No rush.

259
00:23:04,173 --> 00:23:06,133
- Get up!
- Wait! Wait!

260
00:23:06,342 --> 00:23:10,846
This is crazy. If we're all going,
why don't we go together?

261
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,933
You know, split
the money fifty-fifty.

262
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:17,770
- Fifty-fifty?
- You know what I mean. Whatever.

263
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,774
- That 's a good plan.
- It 's a race. It 's a race.

264
00:23:22,983 --> 00:23:25,152
I'm winning!
I'm winning!

265
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,242
And they're off!

266
00:23:32,618 --> 00:23:34,912
No one, gentlemen, no one...

267
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,456
is offering you
action like this.

268
00:23:37,831 --> 00:23:41,627
A horse race with animals that
can think, and plan, and lie...

269
00:23:41,835 --> 00:23:44,755
and cheat, and play dirty!

270
00:23:46,006 --> 00:23:48,926
It 's the gambling experience
of a lifetime.

271
00:23:49,134 --> 00:23:50,886
It 's my way of saying:

272
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:53,973
"I understand men like you.

273
00:23:54,181 --> 00:23:57,893
I know what you want, I know what
you need. This casino, my casino...

274
00:23:58,227 --> 00:23:59,937
is where you belong."

275
00:24:03,607 --> 00:24:04,984
My cab!

276
00:24:05,192 --> 00:24:07,361
- To the airport.
- You got it.

277
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,155
We're out the door.
I don't see you. Where are you?

278
00:24:10,364 --> 00:24:14,535
- I forgot to tip the maid.
- Forget about the maid. There he is!

279
00:24:15,077 --> 00:24:17,037
- Come on.
- Okay.

280
00:24:18,205 --> 00:24:22,334
Bev, this is a real job.
I swear!

281
00:24:24,211 --> 00:24:25,880
What is it?

282
00:24:27,256 --> 00:24:29,341
The job. What 's the job?

283
00:24:31,552 --> 00:24:33,846
Ink... for fountain pens.

284
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:39,226
- And they're in New Mexico?
- Silver City, New Mexico.

285
00:24:39,435 --> 00:24:43,105
I love New Mexico.
Honey, we'll go with you.

286
00:24:43,522 --> 00:24:45,983
- No!
- Why not?

287
00:24:46,775 --> 00:24:51,155
Because we've already paid for the
room. Now who's wasting money?

288
00:24:51,363 --> 00:24:55,409
No! This was your idea. I don't
care about David Copperfield.

289
00:24:55,618 --> 00:24:57,036
This is our family vacation.
We'll go with you.

290
00:24:57,286 --> 00:25:00,372
- But you don't understand...
- We will go with you!

291
00:25:04,126 --> 00:25:06,295
Fine. Fine. Here.

292
00:25:06,503 --> 00:25:08,881
Call the bellman and
have him bring the van around.

293
00:25:10,424 --> 00:25:13,010
Excuse me, excuse me,
I'm in a race.

294
00:25:13,219 --> 00:25:14,762
Excuse me.

295
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,556
Excuse me.
It 's a race.

296
00:25:32,321 --> 00:25:35,407
- What is he doing?
- I think he's sleeping.

297
00:25:35,616 --> 00:25:39,286
- Sleeping?
- He must be narcoleptic.

298
00:25:39,495 --> 00:25:42,748
- But I bet on him!
- So did I. Two million dollars.

299
00:25:42,957 --> 00:25:45,793
I'm sorry gentlemen,
all the bets are locked in.

300
00:25:46,001 --> 00:25:47,419
Sleeping! Sleeping!

301
00:25:56,011 --> 00:25:57,972
- Look at that!
- Don't tell me how to drive!

302
00:25:58,222 --> 00:25:59,723
Ride it!

303
00:26:02,142 --> 00:26:05,271
- Where's my video game?
- Seatbelts everyone.

304
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:06,981
Honey, what is the rush?

305
00:26:07,189 --> 00:26:09,817
I don't want to be late. This is
an opportunity of a lifetime.

306
00:26:10,192 --> 00:26:13,070
You're not just a travel agent,
Roger, you're an angel.

307
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,365
There's one charter plane available
in Las Vegas. We just bagged it.

308
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:20,870
Get rid of it.
Get rid of it!

309
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,705
Throw the ball!

310
00:26:23,163 --> 00:26:27,793
That 's why you're not going to get
drafted! You'll play Arena Football!

311
00:26:29,003 --> 00:26:31,505
- You like football?
- Sure.

312
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:35,634
Did you happen to catch
that Dallas game last week?

313
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:40,681
You can't really call it a game.
It was a crime against football!

314
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,642
I lost twenty grand on that game,
and they would've won!

315
00:26:43,851 --> 00:26:47,146
Now I've got to work two
shifts because of that idiot.

316
00:26:47,354 --> 00:26:50,399
Stevie Wonder could have done
a better job calling that game.

317
00:26:53,694 --> 00:26:55,613
Where the hell is the airport?

318
00:26:57,364 --> 00:27:02,661
One flip of the coin and everything
goes down the crapper. $ 10,50.

319
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:06,832
- Keep the change.
- Thanks a lot! Have a nice flight!

320
00:27:08,542 --> 00:27:10,211
You know who that was?

321
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:14,381
That was the ref. The guy
from the game. The coin-toss.

322
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:17,760
Oh, my God! You're right!
That was him!

323
00:27:17,968 --> 00:27:19,678
I had him in the cab
and I let him go!

324
00:27:20,012 --> 00:27:23,849
- Wait for me?
- Go, go, go.

325
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,684
Chumps.

326
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:53,170
Excuse me. Hi.

327
00:27:54,129 --> 00:27:57,383
- I'm not a creep or anything.
- I don't have any quarters.

328
00:27:58,384 --> 00:28:02,596
I never do this, but I'm reading
the same book you are. Look.

329
00:28:03,764 --> 00:28:05,766
See? Lindbergh.

330
00:28:05,933 --> 00:28:08,394
It 's fantastic, isn't it?
What part are you on?

331
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:13,691
- He just had a sex change.
- Who did? Lindbergh?

332
00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:15,859
A sex change?

333
00:28:21,031 --> 00:28:23,158
- That 's funny.
- I though so.

334
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:28,205
But don't be too proud of yourself.
I'm the most gullible guy in Chicago.

335
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:34,879
- Can I buy you a drink?
- I can't. I'm flying.

336
00:28:35,421 --> 00:28:40,050
- So it will relax you.
- I mean I'm flying. I'm a pilot.

337
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,265
Pilot? Are there
a lot of female pilots?

338
00:28:47,516 --> 00:28:49,643
There's at least one.

339
00:28:52,688 --> 00:28:55,608
As soon as I walk away, I'll think
of something great to say to that.

340
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:58,235
Good. Mail it to me.

341
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:07,453
Flight 115 to Albuquerque.
Gate seventeen. You better hurry.

342
00:29:07,661 --> 00:29:11,498
4 tickets to Albuquerque, please.
Near the front of the plane.

343
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:13,500
Come on!

344
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:15,794
This is so exciting.

345
00:29:16,086 --> 00:29:19,798
I've never been on a private plane
before. It 's bigger than my condo.

346
00:29:20,007 --> 00:29:22,635
- Gentlemen, what 's our E.T.A.?
- One hour and ten minutes.

347
00:29:23,844 --> 00:29:25,846
If you can do it in less than
an hour, I'll buy you both dinner.

348
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,514
You're on.

349
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:31,227
- Watch it! Excuse me.
- Move, move!

350
00:29:31,435 --> 00:29:32,561
- Who was next?
- I was.

351
00:29:32,811 --> 00:29:34,021
- I was!
- I was!

352
00:29:34,313 --> 00:29:35,397
What?
You were not next!

353
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:40,027
- Are you calling me a liar?
- I am. We're in line for 20 minutes.

354
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,947
Hold on.
Is that the correct time?

355
00:29:43,989 --> 00:29:45,616
Yes, it is.

356
00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:49,620
- Who's next?
- They are.

357
00:29:49,828 --> 00:29:51,789
Two tickets to Albuquerque.

358
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,334
Sorry.
We're completely booked.

359
00:29:56,043 --> 00:29:59,672
There's nothing. There's a 4:30,
but you have to switch in Dallas.

360
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:03,175
I have had it.

361
00:30:04,426 --> 00:30:09,181
What do you mean that 's it? I'm not
giving up. And neither are you.

362
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:13,060
And neither am I!
I'll tell you something, brother:

363
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:17,022
If we're not flying out of here,
no one is flying out of here.

364
00:31:17,374 --> 00:31:19,543
That can't be good.

365
00:31:25,883 --> 00:31:27,051
Duane!

366
00:31:50,824 --> 00:31:52,660
Blaine! Blaine!

367
00:31:56,622 --> 00:31:58,541
Shit! Shit!

368
00:32:01,126 --> 00:32:02,920
Blaine!

369
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:08,467
Shit!

370
00:32:11,845 --> 00:32:14,473
- Stop the car!
- Help!

371
00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:20,145
- Duane! Stop! Stop!
- I can't!

372
00:32:22,481 --> 00:32:23,983
Duane, what are you doing?

373
00:32:24,733 --> 00:32:28,112
- What are you doing? Stop the car!
- Move!

374
00:32:28,362 --> 00:32:30,531
Duane, stop the car!

375
00:32:30,739 --> 00:32:32,533
Stop the car!

376
00:32:38,372 --> 00:32:40,124
Blaine!

377
00:33:01,061 --> 00:33:04,356
Freeze everything. Every flight.
Get me Central Operation.

378
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:10,988
Attention all passengers. Due to a
technical problem with our radar...

379
00:33:11,196 --> 00:33:13,657
all flights are postponed
until further notice.

380
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,493
We apologize
for any inconvenience.

381
00:33:18,412 --> 00:33:19,413
Come on, we gotta go.

382
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,582
- Hurry up! Let 's go!
- Wait! Dad!

383
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:22,791
Forget the bags!
Let 's go!

384
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,793
Out of the way!

385
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,589
- This is your license?
- Yes, it is.

386
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,052
- Where was it issued?
- In Guam.

387
00:33:36,513 --> 00:33:39,016
Just head East!
And I'm in a hurry!

388
00:33:39,975 --> 00:33:41,936
Hello again.

389
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,355
East it is.

390
00:33:45,981 --> 00:33:50,569
- We have a mid-size Caprice.
- What color is it?

391
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:54,406
We don't care. Just give us any car
that 's parked closest to the door.

392
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,659
Ask about insurance.

393
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:01,455
- Would you like liability insurance?
- How much is it?

394
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,750
It doesn't matter!
We'll take it. Just hurry.

395
00:34:08,754 --> 00:34:11,423
Hit "enter".
Now "shift".

396
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,593
"Shift" key.

397
00:34:18,847 --> 00:34:20,099
Hey, watch it!

398
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,064
Out, idiot!

399
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,401
Okay, I've got one.

400
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,529
- What?
- A great comeback.

401
00:34:35,155 --> 00:34:40,035
"Are there a lot of female pilots?"
You said: "There's at least one."

402
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,122
I should of said:
"Two, if you count Lindbergh."

403
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,376
Cause you said
he had a sex change.

404
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,295
It 's a work in progress.

405
00:34:49,503 --> 00:34:51,755
- I'm Nick Schaffler.
- Tracy Faucet.

406
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:55,801
- You can have that drink now.
- I told you I'm flying.

407
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,722
- To Roswell in 5 minutes.
- Everybody's grounded.

408
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,893
That 's only for fixed wings. I'm in
a chopper. It 's different system.

409
00:35:10,232 --> 00:35:12,109
Roswell, New Mexico?

410
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:16,322
You're flying to New Mexico?

411
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:20,492
We've been flying down all week.
They're repainting the whole fleet.

412
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:27,166
You can fly.
Nobody else can fly.

413
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:29,668
But you can fly.

414
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,297
And you're flying
to New Mexico.

415
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,675
And nobody else can fly.

416
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,678
Do you need a ride?

417
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,860
- Coconut.
- Coconut. Who had coconut?

418
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,654
I did.

419
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,198
Phil.

420
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:04,912
- That 's the kind of car I'm getting.
- Yeah? Don't count on it.

421
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:09,041
- Why not?
- The Beetle was used by the Nazis.

422
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:14,713
- I'd not be comfortable driving one.
- So, don't drive it. I will.

423
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:18,217
- Dad, I have to go.
- No, you don't.

424
00:36:18,592 --> 00:36:21,720
- Yes, I do. I really do.
- We just stopped.

425
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,723
I couldn't go.
The bathroom was too gross.

426
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:29,061
- Can't you hold it in?
- I can't. It 's an emergency.

427
00:36:29,728 --> 00:36:33,232
- Honey, there's a restaurant.
- That 's 3 miles off the road.

428
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,485
- We lose ten minutes.
- So what? Your daughter has to go.

429
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:40,489
- Please stop, Dad!
- Jason, look for an empty jar.

430
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:45,369
- A jar? Girls don't pee in jars.
- All right, sorry.

431
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,664
Jason, we're going to need
a jar and a funnel.

432
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:53,419
- I don't have to pee! It 's number 2!
- Sorry, I can't stop.

433
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,923
- Dad, I'm prairie dogging it.
- What the hell does that mean?

434
00:36:58,465 --> 00:37:01,719
Like when a prairie dog sticks
its head in and out of the ground.

435
00:37:06,765 --> 00:37:08,934
I do not wanna picture that.

436
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,898
Yes, sir.
Silver City it is, buddy.

437
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:18,193
It 's about 700 miles.
You don't mind, do you?

438
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:23,574
Oh, no. I don't mind.
A job's just another job for me.

439
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:28,996
- About how much that 's gonna cost?
- I wouldn't worry about it.

440
00:37:29,955 --> 00:37:35,252
Tell you what. You just pay me
whatever you think is fair.

441
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,713
Cause...

442
00:37:37,963 --> 00:37:40,090
I trust your judgment.

443
00:37:41,508 --> 00:37:45,054
- I hate you! I hate you!
- All right, nobody look.

444
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:47,431
I'm going to turn on the radio,
honey, so you nobody can hear you.

445
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,808
I'll never forgive you.
I hate you!

446
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:53,020
Nobody can hear you, honey.
Push away!

447
00:38:01,403 --> 00:38:04,865
I'll drop you off right there. In
the parking lot near the hospital.

448
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,825
Great. Great.

449
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,411
- So what 's wrong with her?
- Who?

450
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,372
Your sister.
You said it was serious.

451
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,587
- Shark bite.
- A shark bite?

452
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:26,095
- They took her to Silver City?
- There's a shark attack unit there.

453
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,980
How fast was I going?

454
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:47,616
- Where are we?
- It 's a shortcut I know.

455
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,787
- We should stick to the highway.
- There's a thought.

456
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:56,208
You say we should take highway.
I say we should take my shortcut.

457
00:38:56,667 --> 00:39:00,087
Why don't we just flip a coin?

458
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:03,883
- It 's not what you think!
- Come here, blind son-of-a-bitch!

459
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,635
- Where's that whistle?
- Wait!

460
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,846
- I'm gonna cram it up your ass!
- Wait! Come back here!

461
00:39:09,054 --> 00:39:10,389
Arrivederci!

462
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,482
I'll kill him!

463
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,503
- Squirrels?
- No. Thank you.

464
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:46,091
- We're looking for the Interstate.
- I get that a lot, it 's the detour.

465
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:52,723
Now they lost their way.
Now they can't go home.

466
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,852
- You sure you don't want one?
- We're sure. Thank you.

467
00:39:57,102 --> 00:40:00,648
They make crackerjack pets.
I taught this one to shake hands.

468
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:04,985
He's not for sale, though. Who wants
to go home with the nice ladies?

469
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:08,656
Pick me, pick me!
Don't be afraid, I don't bite.

470
00:40:08,822 --> 00:40:12,159
- What 's your name, pretty lady?
- Vera.

471
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:16,872
- Ma'am, we're not interested.
- I'm not talking to you, am I?

472
00:40:17,122 --> 00:40:19,917
I'm talking to Vera.
What about Buckey here?

473
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:22,628
He just loves to climb
the trees, eat the nuts...

474
00:40:22,836 --> 00:40:27,049
We do not want a squirrel! Now, do
you know where the Interstate is?

475
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,761
Of course I do, I'm not retarded.
Tell them about the short cut.

476
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,974
Thank you, Buckey.
I almost forgot.

477
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:39,228
There's a dandy shortcut. To
exit 14. It'll save you 30 miles.

478
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:45,943
Listen carefully. You go straight
down here, exactly 1.8 miles.

479
00:40:46,151 --> 00:40:50,197
- 1.8 miles.
- Make a left at Totem Pole Ranch.

480
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,075
Go 5.4 miles and
you're gonna go up a big hill...

481
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:56,829
and you'll see a big yellow sign
with graffiti on it.

482
00:40:57,037 --> 00:41:01,333
There's a dirt road, turn right,
it will take you to the interstate.

483
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,128
- Thank you very much.
- Wait a minute.

484
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,339
Take some nuts with you...

485
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,425
Just in case you see a squirrel.

486
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,343
- Okay?
- Okay.

487
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,556
Bye. You could've bought me.

488
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,351
Dammit, dammit.

489
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:26,942
Where am I?

490
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,532
A Barbie Museum!
Can we stop?

491
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:38,370
Sorry, Kimmy, we have a plan.
And we're gonna stick to the plan.

492
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,665
Please, Daddy.
Please, please.

493
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,628
It 's not fair. We never get to
stop at anywhere I want to.

494
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,964
I'm sure Jason doesn't want
to go the Barbie Museum.

495
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:52,593
Are you kidding? I'll stop anywhere.
I'm wigging out back here.

496
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:56,305
C'mon, you really need to pull over
and stop to give the kids a break.

497
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,974
- Maybe on the way back.
- Stop the car.

498
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,393
- I can't do that.
- We all need to stop the car.

499
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,145
- No can do!
- You need to stop the car!

500
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,731
- No!
- Could you please stop that car?

501
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:18,118
- Okay, fine. But ten minutes.
- Wow, the Barbie Museum!

502
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:23,707
Klaus Barbie. Sometimes known
as "The Butcher of Lyons".

503
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,753
Let the Jew revisionist
talk about the death camps...

504
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,756
and so called
"crimes against humanity".

505
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:36,345
This museum is lovingly dedicated to
the Klaus Barbie that nobody knows.

506
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:40,182
The husband, the devoted father,
the wine connoisseur...

507
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,185
and three-time
ballroom dancing champion.

508
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:53,070
Hey, there is the guy.

509
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:58,742
Barbie joined the SS in 1935...

510
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:02,788
where he soon became one of the
Führer's favorite young officers.

511
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:05,207
- Can we go?
- With greater responsibilities.

512
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:08,752
Here we see him standing by
Hitler's touring car.

513
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:12,673
The very same car which can be seen
on display outside in our courtyard.

514
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,134
You're leaving?

515
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:23,142
We have a16:30 book burning
and then, and then we have a...

516
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,602
- A Christening.
...a christening.

517
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,606
For one of our many white
Christian non-Jewish friend.

518
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,482
- Family.
- Restroom.

519
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:34,194
The Hemler Hessin
Van Sturichberg...

520
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:37,072
- Thank you so much.
- I love your do.

521
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,658
Thank you.
It 's beautiful.

522
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:45,372
- Wow! A gift shop.
- I know. Next time, I promise.

523
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:49,126
- Let 's go. Let 's go.
- Oh, my God!

524
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:52,338
- We've been caught!
- What do we do now?

525
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:57,218
- I say we take the interstate.
- No, take highway 12.

526
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,596
- Is a shortcut.
- But you don't know what it is.

527
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:06,227
- It could be a dirt road.
- Maybe we should separate.

528
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,146
- What?
- There's two of us.

529
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:12,399
Maybe we should separate.

530
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,486
You're right.
You're a genius.

531
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:19,406
If we separate, and you steal a car,
we can both go our own way.

532
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:23,661
- And double our chances.
- Alright, you take this...

533
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,372
We only have one key.

534
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:32,753
Look! There it its.
Totem Pole Ranch. Turn left.

535
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:37,424
1.8 miles exactly.
All right, Squirrel Lady.

536
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:46,225
I can't believe it, Dad. You just
stole Adolph Hitler's Mercedes Benz.

537
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:50,396
Hitler had it coming.
What goes around, comes around.

538
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,565
Dad, they're gonna be pissed.

539
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:57,236
They're always pissed, honey.
They're Nazis. It 's their job.

540
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:00,864
Honey, when we get
to Silver City...

541
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,617
we'll call them.
We'll work something out.

542
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:12,084
- North?
- A detour. It'll just take a minute.

543
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:14,712
I just wanted to say "hi"
to my boyfriend.

544
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,263
I can't believe it.

545
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:28,684
That son-of-a-bitch!
That 's Charlene's car!

546
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:32,479
- Charlene?
- His ex-girlfriend, or so I thought.

547
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,733
I'm sure there's a perfectly
innocent explanation.

548
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,486
She probably came by just to pick up
some clothes or something.

549
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,614
Nice and warm, huh?

550
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:58,297
Did I come at a bad time,
asshole?

551
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:05,179
I'm gonna ram this helicopter
right down your throat!

552
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:13,938
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry! My father's a pilot!

553
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:17,608
- I've been flying since I was 15!
- I'm worried about me!

554
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:21,820
Shawn, do you have a minute? I want
to talk about our relationship!

555
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,672
Suck on that, creep!

556
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,881
No!

557
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:45,219
Not the truck!

558
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:47,471
The hood! Oh, my God!

559
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,723
Come on, help me. Open it.

560
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:52,851
- Tracy, I'm not comfortable with...
- Open it!

561
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,402
She's going to kill me.

562
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,029
- We should get out of here.
- Not yet.

563
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:08,534
You two-timing,
back-stabbing snake!

564
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:10,911
You worm! You turd!

565
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,044
My God!
What was I thinking?

566
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,465
I'm getting the tattoo removed!

567
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:31,974
There you go, baby!
Wait for me!

568
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:56,916
- I think we just killed him.
- You can't. He's like a cockroach.

569
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:04,506
Fix the...

570
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,513
Should we be this low?

571
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:19,104
Come on, let 's keep going!
Come on!

572
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:25,945
We just violated
about 115 federal laws.

573
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:28,906
- We?
- I'm going. Are you coming?

574
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:32,284
I don't think I'm...

575
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:36,830
Nice meeting you.

576
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,253
Get out of the truck, Shawn!

577
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,423
That 's it, Tracy!
You and I are through!

578
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,803
Tracy! Wait!

579
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:03,983
- The first illegal thing I've done.
- How does it feel?

580
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:07,486
I'm shaking. But that could be
from the helicopter crash.

581
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:11,824
- Get out of my truck, Tracy!
- It 's my truck! I paid for it!

582
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,492
- And who is this?
- I'm nobody.

583
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:15,452
- Yeah, you are nobody.
- Yeah, nobody.

584
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:18,956
You stay away from her,
unless you're tired of living.

585
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:24,461
While you're here, do me a favor.
Charlene left a bra in the truck!

586
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,882
Can you make sure she gets it?
Thanks, honey.

587
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:20,059
- So where's the driver?
- He's in the powder room.

588
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:24,063
We're never going to get
to Santa Fe by three o'clock.

589
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,065
- This is ridiculous.
- Ridiculous.

590
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:29,360
- I really wish he'd hurry.
- It just seems very unprofessional.

591
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:41,288
You got to help me, my wife's
out back. She's having a baby!

592
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:43,499
- She's having a what?
- A baby!

593
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:47,419
- A baby?
- It 's half out! I can see the head!

594
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,881
- I need your jacket.
- Why?

595
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,635
For her amniotic sack!

596
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,887
Her amniotic fluid,
it 's all gushing out!

597
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:59,265
- Gushing?
- The jacket! The jacket!

598
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,476
Give me the jacket!
And your pants.

599
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:07,314
- My pants?
- Yeah, for her "Placentia"...

600
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:10,901
her labia...
cervical, and...

601
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:15,781
mucus. It 's gushing!
And it 's just a hole, and...

602
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:18,826
The pants!

603
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,620
- And the hat.
- My hat? Why my hat?

604
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,958
For her...

605
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,919
vagina!

606
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:35,134
- Let 's go, ladies. All aboard.
- What happened to Marty?

607
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:38,387
Family emergency.
His wife's having a baby.

608
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:41,932
- A baby?
- I'm Owen. I'm your new driver.

609
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,936
Quiet! Quiet everybody!
Simmer down!

610
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:50,649
We're going to be on our way
in just a minute. This is Owen.

611
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,444
He's our new driver.

612
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:56,113
Everyone say "hello".

613
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:59,325
Hello, Owen!

614
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:04,663
Our next stop is our third annual
"I Love Lucy" convention...

615
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:06,790
in Santa Fe, New Mexico!

616
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:10,544
- What 'd you say?
- Babaloo!

617
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:47,081
- Is he dead?
- Hey, mister, are you dead?

618
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:52,461
It 's a race! It 's a race!

619
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:57,091
Run. Run.
Like crystal lightning!

620
00:52:57,925 --> 00:53:00,052
Taxi! Taxi!

621
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:01,762
Taxi!

622
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,894
Not good. Not good.

623
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:19,196
Don't move! Stay there! I saw the
whole thing! I'll be right down!

624
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:22,157
Shit, Gloria Allred!

625
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:26,453
Hey, buddy, are you okay?
You okay?

626
00:53:26,996 --> 00:53:30,291
You're back! You look great. You
don't want to report this, do you?

627
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:32,918
- Taxi!
- You don't need a taxi! Come on.

628
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:36,672
- Where are you going?
- Silver City, New Mexico.

629
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:40,384
- I am in a race.
- Silver City? It 's your lucky day!

630
00:53:40,593 --> 00:53:44,722
I'm going to El Paso.
It 's right on the way. Come on.

631
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:50,019
I've got to be there by 7 tonight,
I'm going to be driving very fast.

632
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:51,520
Great.

633
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:56,775
Just want one copy? 'Cause
I got an extra one for half price.

634
00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:58,986
Just one. And hurry.

635
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:02,615
That 's the best idea you ever had.
We split up, we take two keys...

636
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:05,075
...we double our chances of winning.
- It can't fail.

637
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:08,579
- You remember where we're going?
- Silver City, New Mexico.

638
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:12,958
- Right. Train station locker, 001.
- 001.

639
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:16,128
Rule number one, Discretion.
Don't talk to anybody.

640
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:19,506
- I won't. I promise.
- I'm serious. It 's 2 million dollars.

641
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:20,841
In cash.

642
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,303
People would just kill us
to get their hands on that key.

643
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:26,972
I love you.

644
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:32,811
- Little brother, you steal a car.
- I'm gonna steal that Corvette.

645
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:37,149
I don't care. I'll meet you in
Silver City. Don't forget your key.

646
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:46,242
That motherfucking asshole!
I'm gonna kill him!

647
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:51,330
There he is!

648
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:54,667
Go! Go!

649
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:58,837
Okay, we're at 2.4 miles.

650
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:02,174
- There's the yellow sign, turn right.
- I see it.

651
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:03,467
- You see it?
- I see it.

652
00:55:03,676 --> 00:55:05,636
I just love this.
This is like a treasure hunt!

653
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:10,558
Slow down!

654
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:11,767
I can't!

655
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:51,891
I guess my favorite episode, if I
have to pick one, is number 34.

656
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:55,561
Ladies! Lucy, Lucy,
stay behind the line, please!

657
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,564
You remember that one when Ricky
thought he was going bald?

658
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:01,859
I don't remember that one.
It sounds like a masterpiece.

659
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:05,029
How about the one she
gets stuck in the fridge?

660
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:09,158
Ma'am! Lucy!
You have to put that out, please!

661
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:21,295
Lucy, your hair!

662
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:25,132
Thank you. I can't decide whether
to keep it up or try something new.

663
00:56:25,341 --> 00:56:27,259
It 's on fire!

664
00:56:35,768 --> 00:56:39,480
- Stop the bus!
- We're not stopping! Put it out!

665
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,066
- Put it out! We're not stopping!
- Stop!

666
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:46,278
The bathroom!
