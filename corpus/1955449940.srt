1
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:02,870
(music box playing)

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:05,581
- [Little Girl] Uncle
Henry, tell me a story.

3
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:06,748
- [Henry] No, it's late.

4
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:07,575
Go to bed.

5
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:08,750
Santa will be here soon.

6
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:10,487
- [Little Girl] No, I want a story.

7
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:11,516
Please.

8
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,256
- [Henry] All right, all right.

9
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,026
You want a happy story or
you want a scary story'?

10
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,352
- [Little Girl] I want
a happy scary story.

11
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,527
- [Henry] A happy scary story?

12
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:20,388
- [Little Girl] Yeah.

13
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:21,495
<i>'</i> [Henry] Fine.

14
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:24,325
Once upon a time there
lived a man by the name,

15
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,604
by the name of Jack Frost.

16
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,672
- [Little Girl] Jack Frost?

17
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:29,497
- [Henry] That's right.

18
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,071
Like in the song, Jack
Frost nipping at your nose.

19
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,104
(laughter)

20
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,242
Only this guy did it for real.

21
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:36,070
- [Little Girl] Uh.

22
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:37,780
- [Henry] You know how regular
folk get up in the morning,

23
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:39,607
eat something and then hurry off to do

24
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,611
whatever for the day.

25
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:41,442
- [Little Girl] Um, hm.

26
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:42,276
- [Henry] Well Jack would get up,

27
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,112
eat something, then hurry
off and kill someone.

28
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,857
'Cause that's what he
did; he killed people.

29
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,684
He'd stick knives in their
faces and cut out their tummies.

30
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:51,723
And stamp on their heads till their

31
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,053
brains got all runny.

32
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,458
- [Little Girl] Uncle Henry I
don't think this is such a--

33
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,360
- [Henry] You wanted a
story, you got a story.

34
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:00,638
- [Little Girl] Uh, okay.

35
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:02,065
But why did he hurt people?

36
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,067
- [Henry] How should I know'?

37
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,967
Maybe his mum and dad
never gave him enough hugs.

38
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,778
Maybe they gave him too many hugs.

39
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,306
Or maybe he just liked the color red

40
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:09,739
and things that went
squish when he stuck

41
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,810
sharp points in them.

42
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:11,639
- [Little Girl] Oh.

43
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:12,712
- [Henry] It doesn't matter.

44
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,041
The only thing that's important

45
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,115
is that no one could catch him.

46
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:17,751
Some say that Jack was a ghost,

47
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:18,920
that he was already dead and could

48
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,317
walk through walls or
vanish into thin air.

49
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:22,149
- [Little Girl] Oh.

50
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:23,961
- [Henry] Truth is he
never stayed in one place

51
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:25,820
long enough to be caught.

52
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:27,496
See Jack was smart.

53
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,630
He'd drift into a town, blend in,

54
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:31,664
puree a few of the locals then just

55
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:33,164
drift off to some place else that

56
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,666
needed a little social pruning.

57
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:37,498
Any towns that
had too many little girls

58
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,242
that looked just like you.

59
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:40,840
- [Little em] But they
did catch him didn't

60
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:41,771
they Uncle Henry?

61
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,604
- [Henry] Well, for five years through

62
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,111
11 states and 38 deaths.
Jack was nimble,

63
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,422
Jack was quick, Jack gouged
eyes with candlesticks.

64
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:52,280
Smashed in skulls with
sticks and stones.

65
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,490
Used iron bars to crush their bones.

66
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:56,761
So he could
hide his kills in tiny places

67
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:58,654
and he wouldn't have
to see their faces.

68
00:01:58,986 --> 00:01:59,964
- [Little Girl] Uncle Henry.

69
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,166
- [Henry] That is until the pies.

70
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,366
- [Little Girl] Pies?

71
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,262
- [Henry] Yeah, little bits
of people started turning

72
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:11,167
up in Mrs. Puddles pecan
pies all over the Midwest.

73
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,876
Fingertips, eyelids, ear lobes.

74
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:17,037
Mm-hm, some say
that Jack had got sloppy

75
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:20,352
or that deep down he
really wanted to be caught.

76
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,813
Others said that it made
the pies taste better.

77
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:23,644
- [Little em] Eww.

78
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,457
- [Henry] Bottom line; Jack
had made his first mistake.

79
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,487
Authorities knew where he worked.

80
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,556
Within a week they traced his car.

81
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:31,794
Then it was just a
matter of time before

82
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:35,293
he was caught, tried,
and sentenced to die.

83
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,293
- [Little Girl] Oh.

84
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:40,230
- [Henry] In fact, right this
very moment Jack is being

85
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,166
taken to his place of execution.

86
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,307
His story should end at midnight

87
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,546
but the fun's just about to begin.

88
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,841
So why don't you go to bed
and have sweet, sweet dreams.

89
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,920
(christmas music)

90
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,846
- Tell you something; that
murdering bastard Jack Frost

91
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:23,842
in here is one lucky son of a bitch.

92
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:24,740
- Lucky'?

93
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:26,449
He's being executed in 30 minutes.

94
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,411
- Yeah well, at least he
doesn't have to drive back

95
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,050
through this crap.

96
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,616
- Deep fried Jack sewed at midnight.

97
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:39,063
(laughter)

98
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,866
(ominous music)

99
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,141
- Say pal'?

100
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,416
How about a smoke?

101
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,447
(lighter striking)

102
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,883
- Say Frost, why don't
you shut the hell up?

103
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:12,157
(exhaling smoke)

104
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:16,464
- Filtered.

105
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:21,571
(christmas music)

106
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:25,843
- Hey, Jack we just crossed
the Snowmonton county line.

107
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,942
Ain't this where you screwed up'?

108
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,748
- Screwed up'?

109
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,608
- Yeah, for years the FBI was chasing

110
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,443
this overgrown piece of shit.

111
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,485
Crossed like half a dozen states.

112
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,258
Then this backwater sheriff plays hero

113
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,117
for five minutes and
takes all the glory.

114
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,327
(laughter)

115
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,326
Ain't how it happened Jack?

116
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,363
Almost got away with it didn't you?

117
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:55,302
<i>Haw'?</i>

118
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:58,271
<i>Haw'?</i>

119
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,104
Everything okay back there Harv?

120
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,971
- Oh we're doing fine, real fine.

121
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,816
(neck snapping)

122
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:22,133
(light piano music)

123
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,544
(ominous music)

124
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:53,025
(coffee sloshing into cap)

125
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,331
(ominous music)

126
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:55,064
- What--

127
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,025
- The...

128
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:56,834
- Fuck--

129
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,892
(brakes squealing)

130
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,536
(screaming)

131
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:02,499
- Oh yeah.

132
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:11,907
(screaming and vehicles crashing)

133
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,723
(wind blowing)

134
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:35,129
(fire roaring)

135
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,581
(thumping)

136
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,657
(creaking)

137
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:05,736
(heavy breathing and footsteps)

138
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:14,468
(handcuffs clinking)

139
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,610
(laughter)

140
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,645
- Looks like deep fried
Jack is off the menu

141
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,145
for tonight, huh'?

142
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,475
- Jesus Christ.

143
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,183
(creaking)

144
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,591
- Now, we can do this the easy way

145
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,125
Of we can--

146
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,365
(door bursting open)

147
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,600
This is gonna hurt.

148
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:38,834
(chemicals exploding from truck)

149
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,298
(screaming)

150
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,806
(ominous music)

151
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,716
(screaming)

152
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,884
(ominous music)

153
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,080
(screaming)

154
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:42,728
(gun shots)

155
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:46,668
(car engine)

156
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,616
(car radio playing)

157
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,713
- Honey, you're miles away.

158
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,922
- I'm all right.

159
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,124
- It's after midnight.

160
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,520
No more stays of execution.

161
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,292
It's over.

162
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:17,431
No more nightmares about Jack Frost.

163
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,398
(police radio)

164
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:26,199
(door opening and shutting)

165
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,610
(footsteps)

166
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:35,950
- Hi there.

167
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:39,988
Engine problems'?

168
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,621
- Bladder problem.

169
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:46,455
- I'm gonna need to see
your license please.

170
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,731
Stay away from the vehicle please.

171
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,773
- Make up your god damn mind.

172
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,507
You want to see my license
or do you want

173
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,105
me to stay here?

174
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,077
It's your move Sheriff.

175
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:07,651
- I want you to stay
away from the vehicle

176
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,284
and lie down on the ground.

177
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,954
(ominous music)

178
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,497
- This one you are gonna regret.

179
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,279
That's right Sheriff you take a good

180
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,482
long look at this face.

181
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:41,785
'Cause the next time
you see it it's gonna

182
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,849
tear your world apart.

183
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,713
I'll find a way.

184
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,718
I'll tear your town apart.

185
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,117
<i>I'll</i> kill your family.

186
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:49,984
I'll kill you.

187
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:50,794
You're dead.

188
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:51,618
You hear me'?

189
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:52,452
Dead.

190
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,890
- Honey, honey, honey'?

191
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:55,858
Slow down.

192
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,526
- What's going on'?

193
00:10:58,858 --> 00:10:59,495
Whoa.

194
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,172
Touch my finger, touch my knee.

195
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,202
Thank the Lord it was not me.

196
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:05,976
Wow, there's an ambulance.

197
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,141
Can we stop please'?

198
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:08,070
- Oh I don't think so.

199
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,402
Now you just settle down we'll be home

200
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,079
in about 20 minutes.

201
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,680
- There's two squad cars,
an ambulance.

202
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,315
- And a partridge in a pear tree.

203
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:16,416
- That's very nice Ryan.

204
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:19,223
- Sweetie put your seat belt on.

205
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,725
- What happened here officer?

206
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:24,551
I'm with the local--

207
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,090
- Keep it moving sir
this is a federal matter.

208
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,056
- Okay.

209
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,360
(police radio)

210
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:36,540
- Then it just ran off.

211
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,274
But he couldn't run.

212
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:41,602
It was, it was like
he was trying but he

213
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,511
didn't have legs.

214
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,545
Like he was part of the snow.

215
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:48,375
- What the--

216
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,585
- I'll take it from here.

217
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:55,285
You the man who
witnessed the incident?

218
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:02,431
Let's you and me take a
little midnight stroll.

219
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,227
(police radio)

220
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,936
(footsteps)

221
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:17,973
(christmas music and news broadcast)

222
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,784
(door creaking)

223
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,119
- The driveway is clear.

224
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,117
- It's all over the news.

225
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,757
- Yeah, I was listening
to it on the car radio.

226
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,393
(news broadcast)

227
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,494
- Dad, who's Jack Frost?

228
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,430
- Jack Frost was a very bad man honey

229
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,599
but now he's gone.

230
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:39,835
Poof.

231
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,069
- Like magic?

232
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,305
- Yeah that's right, just like magic.

233
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,836
- And is he coming back'?

234
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:45,938
- No.

235
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,769
So you don't have to worry about him.

236
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,343
- And you made him go
away, didn't you dad?

237
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,151
- Well I kind of helped I guess.

238
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,249
- My dad's a hero.

239
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:57,646
- No son, I just happened to be

240
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,014
in the right place at the wrong time.

241
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,256
I'm not a hero.

242
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:02,150
- You are to me.

243
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,358
- Me too.

244
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,356
- Oh come on now.

245
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:08,188
You're gonna get all mushy
and I got a job to go to.

246
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,364
- But I made you special.

247
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,135
(laughter)

248
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,132
- Oh yum Ryan, that looks great.

249
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,668
Uh look, I think I'm
gonna save this for lunch.

250
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:18,498
Okay?

251
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:19,366
I'll put it in a baggie--

252
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,007
- Coward.

253
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:22,176
- And I'll have it for lunch.

254
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:23,310
Okay?

255
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,774
- Take some more.

256
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:25,605
- Thanks.

257
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:26,939
Fill it up.

258
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:27,944
- <i>Sam'?</i>

259
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,150
- What?

260
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,853
It's okay, it's going to be okay.

261
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,179
Come on, fill it up.

262
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:36,824
- Dad, can I build a snowman
for the competition today?

263
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,357
- Oh sure, how else you
gonna win first prize.

264
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:40,357
But I want you all wrapped up.

265
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:41,461
Okay?

266
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:42,960
And the tree trimming
is at 5:00 sharp.

267
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,165
- How could we forget'?

268
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,628
- Yeah.

269
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,699
No, no, no, no.

270
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:48,801
(giggling)

271
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,165
- You're toast Mr. Snowman.

272
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:55,911
(christmas music and laughter)

273
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,680
(christmas music)

274
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,323
(car breaks squealing)

275
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,322
- Hey, hey no looking 'till Saturday.

276
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:12,391
You know the rules.

277
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:13,220
- Come on Dad.

278
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:14,327
- No, not until Saturday.

279
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:15,826
You're gonna jinx us.

280
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,533
- [Female] Look at this over here.

281
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,565
(car door shutting)

282
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,270
- [Female] Hey Sam!

283
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,404
Oh oh Alex come here for a second.

284
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:27,234
- [Alex] What do you want?

285
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:28,602
- Morning Jake.

286
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,045
I see you couldn't get to that porch

287
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,351
railing while we were away.

288
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:34,879
- No I didn't get to it.

289
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:35,709
I'll do it.

290
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:36,713
- Sure, by New Year's?

291
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:37,680
- Yeah I said I'll do it.

292
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:38,613
- Great.

293
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,053
<i>_</i> Hey hey hey.

294
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:42,883
- Hi Jill.

295
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,251
- Hi Mr. Tyler.

296
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,592
- I'm making angel wings.

297
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,796
- Oh that's beautiful Sally.

298
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:51,102
- Sally you want to help me with this?

299
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:52,960
- You know when I was a little girl

300
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,600
I always wanted to be the angel

301
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,134
on top of the Christmas tree.

302
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,274
- Good.

303
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:00,737
You want to help me tie this now'?

304
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:01,943
- Sure honey.

305
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:07,575
- How's it going there Billy?

306
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,284
- It's going.

307
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:10,417
- I see your dad's got his snowman

308
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,121
all covered up; big secret.

309
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,754
- I guess.

310
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:15,923
- Well he may win for the 5th year

311
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,250
in a row, right'?

312
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,460
That's a pretty big deal.

313
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:20,491
- Whatever.

314
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,463
- Well, nice talking to you Billy.

315
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,002
- Working hard Tommy'?

316
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,930
- Hey there Mr. T how you doing'?

317
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,833
Everybody, the law is back in town.

318
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,611
So Mr. T, what do you think?

319
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,743
It's a snow babe.

320
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:40,243
I'm gonna call her Cindy Snowflake.

321
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:41,074
(laughter)

322
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,283
- I think it's very cool Tommy.

323
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,416
- All right.

324
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,917
Hey wait a second.

325
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,453
What's the difference between snowmen

326
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,283
and snow-women'?

327
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,117
- Tommy.

328
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:51,952
- Now really, what's the difference?

329
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:52,990
- I'll see ya Tommy.

330
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,457
- It's snowballs.

331
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,857
Gel it Mr. T'?

332
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:56,826
Snowballs.

333
00:15:57,924 --> 00:15:59,096
(honking)

334
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,335
- Hey Bob.

335
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,867
(car engine)

336
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:09,940
Morning Paul.

337
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,373
I saw your Tommy.

338
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:12,341
- Keeping out of trouble I hope.

339
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:13,878
- As ever.

340
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,778
- I heard about, uh, Jack Frost.

341
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,053
End of an era.

342
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,158
- End of a nightmare.

343
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,223
- I'll find a way!

344
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:25,822
- Sam you okay'?

345
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:26,653
- Oh yeah yeah.

346
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:27,555
No I'm great.

347
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:28,831
I'm great Paul.

348
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,328
- So you, uh, dig out your
driveway this morning?

349
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,158
Huh'?

350
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:32,993
(laughter)

351
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,236
- Up at 6:00 AM.

352
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,402
- Okay all right,
you come in the store,

353
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,298
I'll give you 20% off because I think

354
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,574
you're about the best
law enforcement officer

355
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:39,638
we ever had around these parts.

356
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:40,467
All right'?

357
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,505
- Maybe next season Paul.

358
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,335
- Okay.

359
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,408
Hold on, you know what the difference

360
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:44,874
is between a snowman and a snow--

361
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:45,875
- I heard this one Paul.

362
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:46,910
- Oh, okay.

363
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:50,410
(footsteps)

364
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:51,380
Uh Tommy!

365
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,157
- Good morning Tommy.

366
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,356
- Oh hi Jill.

367
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,659
- Whatcha making Tommy?

368
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:57,586
- Oh this?

369
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:58,725
Um, nothing.

370
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:03,190
Just uh, I mean it's
not supposed to be you.

371
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,367
- So uh you want to meet up later?

372
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,227
- Later?

373
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,905
Um, actually you know kind of busy.

374
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,208
Busy stuff, doing a lot of things.

375
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,510
I don't know if I can make it over.

376
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,779
- We can go snowballing.

377
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:18,844
- Tommy we got salt, ice, you know.

378
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:20,910
Deliveries.

379
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,877
Come on.

380
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,788
(car engine)

381
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,864
(car door opening and closing)

382
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,296
(footsteps)

383
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,904
- But daddy I made those
oats special for you.

384
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,711
(footsteps)

385
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:06,123
(door opening and whistling)

386
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,456
- Morning Marla.

387
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:10,290
(blow dryer)

388
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,000
Where is everybody?

389
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,602
Well good morning to you too Sam.

390
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,930
And how are you on this fine morning'?

391
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,766
How was your weekend skiing?

392
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,409
Well Marla you know I
don't like to ski myself

393
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:26,945
but Ryan and Anne told me
they had a really gnarly time.

394
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,685
What's the matter, somebody die'?

395
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:41,821
(rocking chair creaking)

396
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:43,360
- Shit Sam, we ain't had a killing

397
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,828
in the county all our lives.

398
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,998
- I knew Old Man Harper ever since I

399
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,035
learned how to steal
apples from his orchard.

400
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,776
- We all did Chris, we all did.

401
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,205
So what do you got'?

402
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:58,173
- Nothing.

403
00:18:59,271 --> 00:18:59,874
- What do you mean nothing'?

404
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,685
You got to have something.

405
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,316
- Look about Sam.

406
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:04,519
We got no vehicle tracks.

407
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,517
- No footprints in the snow.

408
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:08,382
- I got no sign
of a struggle or attempt

409
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:09,624
to break into the house.

410
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,189
- No blood.

411
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,497
- Nothing.
Nothing.

412
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,059
- All right, I don't want
this thing spreading anymore

413
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:16,025
than it needs to.

414
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,699
The whole town will go crazy.

415
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,561
Why don't you get Doc Peters?

416
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,134
Take your foot off the chair.

417
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,237
Get Doc Peters on the phone,
tell him to come up here.

418
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:26,702
- Yeah.

419
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,068
- Why don't you go
down to Donna's motel,

420
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:30,039
the gas station, liquor store;

421
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,508
ask them if anybody
passed through last night.

422
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,318
Tell them a feed store
was robbed or something.

423
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,086
- Feed store, right.

424
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,583
Sam, what are you gonna be doing'?

425
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,053
- I got to make sure of something.

426
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,863
(footsteps)

427
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,360
(car door opening)

428
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,228
Marla put me through
to the FBI will ya'?

429
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,903
- Will you get me some apples?

430
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,265
(laughter)

431
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:03,012
- Show me two hours no
injuries, natural obstacles.

432
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,837
- [Female] I have a sheriff
from Snowmonton County

433
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,742
on the phone for you
asking about Jack Frost.

434
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:09,382
- Put him through.

435
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,686
This is Agent Manners;
who am I speaking to?

436
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,289
- Uh, Sam Tyler, Snowmonton
County Sheriff's Department.

437
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,059
I'd like to ask you a
couple of questions about

438
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,726
the Jack Frost accident.

439
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,189
- Well I'm afraid
that most information

440
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,362
concerning the incident
is confidential

441
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,565
but I'll help you if I can.

442
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,564
- Well we had a killing
down here last night

443
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,203
and I need to know that
Jack Frost is really dead.

444
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,975
- Oh yeah Sheriff, Jack
Frost did indeed die

445
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,108
in the accident;
that I can assure you.

446
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:36,879
Anything else I can help you with?

447
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,443
- No, thank you very much.

448
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:39,715
- Not a problem.

449
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,985
Good luck with your investigation.

450
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,116
- Thank you.

451
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,287
(signing)

452
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:47,920
It's over.

453
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,123
- It started.

454
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,789
- It wasn't meant to happen like this.

455
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:53,222
- So you keep saying.

456
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,725
- We hadn't even tested
the acid on an amoeba.

457
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:57,500
Let alone a human cell.

458
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,461
This is a disaster.

459
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:00,668
- Disaster?

460
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,132
You got to learn to look on
the bright side of things.

461
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,236
- The bright side?

462
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:05,132
- Sure.

463
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,501
At least you know it works.

464
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,173
It's just a shame that your guinea pig

465
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:14,474
had to be a homicidal
maniac like Jack Frost.

466
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:18,277
Who I now have to put
back in the test tube.

467
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:28,356
- Well, there are no lesions
in the muscles of the neck.

468
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:30,462
No tears.

469
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:36,030
Now, there is a fractured
cervical vertebrae one and two.

470
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:40,433
So I'm guessing that his
head was snapped back

471
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,713
with alarming force but just the once.

472
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:51,454
Also notice that there's
no bruising in the face.

473
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,814
So I would say something soft was held

474
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,649
in place to disperse the pressure.

475
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,462
Like, a mitten or a large glove.

476
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,655
- That's all we need around here;

477
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,729
the catcher mitt killer.

478
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:05,694
- Yeah.

479
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,203
You think he's gonna strike again?

480
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,501
- I don't know doc but I'll
be bolting my door tonight.

481
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:20,415
- I'll be tracking my
dresser in front of mine Sam.

482
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:24,551
(car pulling into the driveway)

483
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,656
(car door opening)

484
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:34,095
(bags rustling)

485
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,990
(car door closing)

486
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:38,427
(footsteps)

487
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:45,041
(ominous music and dog barking)

488
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:51,212
(creepy christmas music)

489
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:58,945
(door opening)

490
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:02,089
- Look, I made special.

491
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:06,258
- Honey I just cleaned up
after your special oats.

492
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,360
- But these are extra special.

493
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:13,432
- They're very, not as
special as that snowman

494
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,295
that you made outside.

495
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:16,732
- I didn't make a snowman.

496
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,268
- Oh, well someone built it.

497
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,270
But it's not finished.

498
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,579
Needs a face so I
thought that maybe you

499
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,439
could go outside
and finish that up for--

500
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,478
(running)

501
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,717
I'll just spray down the kitchen.

502
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:32,750
(panicked chatter)

503
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:35,648
- Sam what's going on'?

504
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:39,292
- What the hell are you
going to do about this?

505
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:40,926
- All right, hold it hold it hold it.

506
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,231
- I tried to calm them down, I tried.

507
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:43,624
- There's no need to panic.

508
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:44,627
- What the hell are
you talking about Sam?

509
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:45,902
Old Man Harper's dead.

510
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:47,898
- That's right, Old Man
Harper has been killed

511
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:49,069
and we don't have a lead.

512
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:50,237
But you guys running
around here like a

513
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:51,802
a bunch of vigilantes
isn't going to make

514
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:52,973
my job any easier.

515
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:53,800
- Right.

516
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:56,477
- Now I suggest you men
go home to your families.

517
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:58,645
- Jesus, you think this
psycho drifters gonna

518
00:23:58,971 --> 00:23:59,949
snub out some other
poor son of a bitch.

519
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:00,909
Don't ya?

520
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,150
- Did I say that?

521
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,010
Did I say that?

522
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:05,651
Look, Old Man Harper
lived way out here

523
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,423
five miles outside of town.

524
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:08,349
- What does that mean'?

525
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:09,659
We all live on the outskirts of town.

526
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:12,826
- Right, and so do we
and we're not scared.

527
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:14,597
Now whoever did this
is already a 100 miles

528
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,591
away from here.

529
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,423
- Yeah Sam, well that may
be but I'll tell ya what;

530
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,360
I'm going to keep
my store open all hours,

531
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:21,330
anybody wants to buy extra ammo, huh.

532
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,435
20% discount for an emergency.

533
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:24,934
Come on, come on.

534
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:27,642
(group chatter)

535
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,446
- It's gonna be a
gal dang turkey shoot.

536
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,975
- Of hell Sam it's
quicker than a jury.

537
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,148
(tires screeching)

538
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:37,947
- So you reckon you're about ready

539
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:40,689
to step out to lunch with me then?

540
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:42,356
- Do I look ready?

541
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:43,819
- Sure do to me.

542
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:47,286
(spraying aerosol spray)

543
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,621
- Ah, luckily for you Joe the power

544
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,366
to cloud men's minds
is a responsibility

545
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,397
I take very seriously.

546
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:56,673
(makeup mirror snapping shut)

547
00:24:56,996 --> 00:25:01,342
(trashcan banging against leg)

548
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,147
(ominous music)

549
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:12,649
(rustling)

550
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,922
(birds cawing)

551
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:23,699
(ominous music)

552
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:57,356
- Hey move it.

553
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:58,793
I said move it.

554
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,695
Or are you deaf as well as butt ugly'?

555
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:03,438
You're standing in the
middle of a black ice

556
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,639
sled run snot for brains.

557
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,779
- But this is my dad's front lawn.

558
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:09,875
- Look, are you gonna move
or am I gonna

559
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:11,306
have to kick your
stomach out the top of

560
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:12,911
your head again'?

561
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,576
(signing)

562
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,047
- I hope he breaks his face.

563
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:19,082
- What'd you say'?

564
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,082
- Nothing.

565
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,621
- Look, nobody says
nothing behind my back.

566
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,553
The killer snowman, is it yours?

567
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:26,487
- Yes.

568
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,394
No!

569
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,323
- Oh yes.

570
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:36,900
I think the black ice sled
run is officially open.

571
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,799
And all the kings horses
and all the kings men

572
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:41,805
couldn't give a rats ass
about Tyler's little snowman.

573
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:42,771
Huh.

574
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,179
(screaming)

575
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:51,777
- I didn't do it.

576
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,250
- Holy moly Ryan killed Billy!

577
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,615
- It wasn't me.

578
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:59,254
(ominous music)

579
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:05,965
- Billy just had a birthday.

580
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:11,032
(light christmas music
and soft crowd chatter)

581
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:31,189
(crying)

582
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:32,689
- Shh, it's okay.

583
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:36,192
- Will you please stop
telling me to calm down'?

584
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:37,159
Shut up!

585
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,897
I'm not nuts!

586
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:41,704
There's one god damn
psycho in this town

587
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,802
and it's your kid Sheriff.

588
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:44,630
- Jay, Jay-

589
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:45,464
- That kid is touched by the devil.

590
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:46,400
- Honey don't.

591
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:47,073
- Let's take this somewhere
else, come on.

592
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,901
- This is okay with me right here.

593
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,407
- Look, I am truly sorry
about what happened

594
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:53,978
but I have to believe my son.

595
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:57,549
- Your son says a snowman
pushed my son Billy.

596
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:58,980
Do you believe that'?

597
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,187
Do you believe that'?

598
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,217
- There couldn't have been a fight.

599
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:03,686
Billy is two feet taller than Ryan.

600
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:04,756
- [Female] Not anymore he ain't.

601
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:05,891
- You haven't heard the last of this.

602
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:07,094
- L, I believe that.

603
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:08,056
I believe that Jay.

604
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:09,058
- And you watch
the way you talk to me.

605
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:10,833
I'm not above punching
an officer of the law

606
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:11,691
if it calls for it.

607
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,002
- Why don't you go home and calm down?

608
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:15,703
We'll talk about this tomorrow.

609
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,530
- 'Cause I can't
talk about it tomorrow.

610
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:21,936
'Cause I got to look for a
place to bury my son tomorrow.

611
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:26,776
Jill, Sally, we're
going home, come on.

612
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,785
- He's usually not so short tempered.

613
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,019
- I know, I know.

614
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:32,845
- I'm sorry.

615
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:34,452
(horn honking)

616
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,919
(footsteps)

617
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:43,196
- All right, why don't we all
just go on home, all right?

618
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:45,968
Let's keep Billy in our prayers.

619
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,300
(footsteps)

620
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,447
- I didn't do it.

621
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,478
The snowman pushed him.

622
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:03,252
- That's all he keeps saying.

623
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,610
He must be terrified.

624
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:05,921
- I know Ryan.

625
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:09,058
I know.

626
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:11,827
(ominous music)

627
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:19,263
(gas stove lighting)

628
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,571
(humming)

629
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:30,469
(knife hitting cutting board)

630
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,282
(ominous music)

631
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,923
(chopping celery)

632
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:51,992
(stirring soup)

633
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,970
- You take a good
long look at this face

634
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:58,502
'cause the next time
you see it it's gonna

635
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,468
tear your world apart.

636
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,777
I'll find a way.

637
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:02,703
I'll find a way.

638
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:04,309
I'll kill you and your whole--

639
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,116
- I thought you destroyed those.

640
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,512
(signing)

641
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,980
- I wish it was that easy.

642
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:16,851
- Sam, he's gone
and he can't come back.

643
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,393
The only place he
exists now is in here.

644
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,296
I'm gonna destroy these.

645
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:26,534
(rustling papers)

646
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,064

(door opening)

652
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,825
<i>- Oh, Jesus Sam.</i>

653
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,893
- Well, gosh sakes
I could have shot you.

654
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:57,165
(laughter)

655
00:30:57,489 --> 00:30:58,729
- Well Sam hell, everybody knows

656
00:30:59,057 --> 00:30:59,728
you couldn't hit
the broadside of a barn

657
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:00,900
with a scatter gun.

658
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:02,034
(laughter)

659
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,533
Annie hi, evening.

660
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,363
- Hi Paul.

661
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,834
- Uh, where you want the salt?

662
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:06,767
Garage is all locked up.

663
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:08,544
- The salt?

664
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,403
Why don't you just put it right there.

665
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:11,874
- All right, didn't
mean to scare you Sam.

666
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,184
- That's all right were
just a little jumpy tonight.

667
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:15,007
All right'?

668
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,410
- Oh, okay all right.

669
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:17,243
- I'll see you in the morning.

670
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:18,077
- All right.

671
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:18,911
- Thanks for the salt.

672
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:19,949
- 20% off on the salt too.

673
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:21,018
- I'll see you in the morning.

674
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:22,051
- [Paul] And I'll give you
20% off of that garbage can.

675
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:22,882
- Paul, thank you.

676
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,421
- [Paul] Your snow shovel's
not looking very good either.

677
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,956
(door closing)

678
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:26,921
Okay.

679
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,396
(christmas music)

680
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,565

to put the tree lights on'?

681
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,538
(christmas music)

682
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:45,141
- Your son isn't cold five hours

683
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,949
you want festivities.

684
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:48,114
- I was only--

685
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,544
- Yeah, well don't.

686
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:52,219
(christmas music)

687
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:54,490
(footsteps)

688
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:55,450
- Hey!

689
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:57,618
And where in God's name
do you think you're

690
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:00,156
prowling off to like
some lady of the night?

691
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,055
Our grief isn't good enough for you?

692
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:03,388
You may not have cared
for your little brother--

693
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:05,395
- Jesus dad, I loved Billy.

694
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,135
- Do not be forsaking the Lord's name

695
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:09,837
in my house little girl!

696
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:13,109
- The Lord forsook
this house long ago.

697
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,579
I'm going to see Tommy.

698
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:18,848

(door opening)

701
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:22,283
- She's only talking back to you

702
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,984
because she's upset.

703
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,084
(christmas music)

704
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:30,154
- Sally, when I want
philosophy I'll turn on Oprah.

705
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:31,825
Finish my scarf.

706
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,187
I'm going to get more wood.

707
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,295

00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:47,538

(match striking)

714
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:19,904
- [Jack] Say pal, how about a smoke'?

715
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,470
(laughter)

716
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:26,248
(ominous music)

717
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,673
- Who's that?

718
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,152
What's that?

719
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,585
Sam?

720
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:37,555
Hey Sam.

721
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:40,495
Sam is that you?

722

(ominous music)

723
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:44,865
You come to make peace?

724
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,726
(laughter)

725
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,538
(ominous music)

726
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:58,576
- [Jack] Yeah, get it.

727
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:00,278
Put your back into it.

728
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,016
Come on, come on, you can do it.

729
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,011
That's my boy.

730
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,685
Get it, get it, oh very good.

731
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:08,116
(laughter)

732
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:10,926
(ominous music)

733
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,887
- All right, all right come on.

734
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:21,098
Come on you god damn psycho freak.

735
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,097
I'm ready for you.

736
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,909
(ominous music)

737
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,882
Come out here where I can see you

738
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,249
you Christ loathing dog.

739
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:46,062
(ominous music)

740
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:49,095
(footsteps)

741
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,162
I'm warning you.

742
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,969
(ominous music)

743
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,332
(gasping)

744
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,938
- [Jack] Gosh, I only
axed you for a smoke.

745
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,943
(laughter)

746
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,752
(ominous music)

747
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:18,654
- Oh Jake, if
I've asked you once I've--

748
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:21,590
(ominous music)

749
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:28,000
Oh.

750
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,465
(footsteps)

751
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,867
(humming)

752
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,477
(ominous music)

753
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,646
(humming)

754
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:50,183
(ominous music)

755
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,887
Oh Jake, that's so sweet of you.

756
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:59,025
(ominous music)

757
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,061
That's funny.

758
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:06,635
(ominous music)

759
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:09,738
(footsteps)

760
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:11,843
(ominous music)

761
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,708
(ornaments rattling on tree)

762
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:18,848
(ominous music)

763
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,178
Oh.

764
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,992
(ominous music)

765
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:40,603
(fast paced christmas music)

766
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:55,282
(ornaments breaking
and muffled screaming)

767
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:08,235
(fast paced christmas music)

768
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,938
(star buzzing)

769
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:15,773
(knocking)

770
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:17,739
- Oh, sorry folks.

771
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:18,706
Shed was all blocked.

772
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:20,948
I didn't know where
you wanted the salt.

773
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:22,649
- [Jack] Ho, ho, ho, and what's your

774
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:24,248
name little boy'?

775
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:25,213
(laughter)

776
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:26,613
- Oh my god.

777
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:28,390
(ominous music)

778
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:31,216
- [Jack] Always remember
to dress up warm.

779
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,324
(laughter)

780
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:36,291
(heavy breathing)

781
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:39,566
- I just came over here to tell them

782
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:41,393
all how sorry I was about Billy.

783
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:42,329
<i>Jesus Sam.</i>

784
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,161
- All right, Joe.

785
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:45,600
We're gonna do this thing calmly.

786
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:46,738
I want you to get the photographer--

787
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:48,806
- For Christ's sake, who
the hell would do this?

788
00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:49,976
Well someone's got to go tell Jill

789
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:51,746
her entire family's dead.

790
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,344
Jesus, she's only 18.

791
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:54,445
- Keep it down Joe.

792
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:55,751
The whole town's gonna go crazy.

793
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:57,644
I need for you to keep it together.

794
00:37:57,976 --> 00:37:58,477
We got a job to do.

795
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,084
We're gonna do it right.

796
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,118
First I want you
to find Jill and I want

797
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:05,451
you to get Doc Peters
and bring him up here.

798
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,320
Take a look at Sally.

799
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:09,924
- You don't reckon we
should leave her up

800
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:12,929
for the 12 days of Christmas then?

801
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:15,204
(gagging)

802
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,833
(horn honking)

803
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,305
(footsteps)

804
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:28,507
(wind howling)

805
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:32,951
(footsteps)

806
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:36,725
(door opening and shutting)

807
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:39,354
- Marla I want you to call around

808
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:41,994
see if you can
get a hold of Jill Metzner.

809
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,322
Oh, call the FBI in Denver too.

810
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,693
Some asshole named Manners.

811
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:49,971
Who are you'?

812
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:51,632
(footsteps)

813
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:53,067
- I'm the asshole.

814
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:54,877
I'll get back to you later.

815
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,476
Well, this is an auspicious
start we've gotten off to.

816
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,713
You must be Sheriff Tyler.

817
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:00,743
- Yeah, Tyler.

818
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:01,846
- I'm agent Manners.

819
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,151
- FBI?

820
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:04,976
- Sure, why not.

821
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,914
And this is Stone.

822
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:07,916
- [Sam] Agent Stone.

823
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:08,883
- Sheriff.

824
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,217
- Why are you here?

825
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,223
- We've got a line
on your Abraham Harper.

826
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:16,327
- Old Man Harper,
yeah, what about him?

827
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,031
- His death matches the MO of someone

828
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,029
we've been tracking for some time now.

829
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:20,927
- Yeah, well we've
got two more deaths.

830
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:23,000
I was just about to try
to get you on the phone.

831
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:23,829
- Good.

832
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:26,039
Have the MV's been moved'?

833
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,541
- Motor vehicles?

834
00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:32,677
- Have the murder
victims been moved yet'?

835
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:37,077
- No, uh, Jake and Sally
Metzner have not been moved yet.

836
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:41,615
- Fine, first take
me to the crime scene.

837
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:44,722
Excuse me, Jake and Sally's place.

838
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,628
If everything checks
out as I think it will

839
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:51,798
I'll have a task force
in here by midnight.

840
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:56,367
- This mean the case is
being taken out of my hands?

841
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:58,640
- It was never in them Sheriff.

842
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,738
(police radio)

843
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:03,444
(footsteps)

844
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:04,746
(door opening)

845
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,548
- You were right the first time Sam.

846
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:07,372
(door closing)

847
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:08,775
Asshole.

848
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:11,815
(fast paced music)

849
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:16,286
- I don't know why you're
so interested in this

850
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:17,115
dam footprint.

851
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:19,155
Whoever did this obviously
came through the backdoor.

852
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:20,622
- It was locked.

853
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:23,633
- They locked it behind them.

854
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:26,299
- You're obviously not a
man of science Sheriff.

855
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,501
The latest advanced in forensics

856
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:30,100
means that a
footprint can be as accurate

857
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,771
as a fingerprint.

858
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:34,802
(footsteps)

859
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:36,237
- I'm reading something.

860
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:37,671
- What?

861
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,107
- Oh sweet Jesus look at this.

862
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,746
This thing is able to latently alter

863
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:43,518
it's elemental molecular structure.

864
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:44,945
- English Stone, English.

865
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,483
- It can freeze and unfreeze at will.

866
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,520
It melted, came through the doggy door

867
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:52,759
and refroze on the inside.

868
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:54,825
- You mean Jack came
through the doggy door

869
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:56,530
and refroze on the inside.

870
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,698
What the hell have you
let loose in this town?

871
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,436
(ice cracking)

872
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,539
- Now there should be lacerations

873
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:08,810
to indicate where the handle of the ax

874
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,307
we twisted from side to
side to help it down.

875
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:15,174
But no, all the cuts
are near vertical.

876
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:18,350
It forced the handle straight down.

877
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,615
That's immensely powerful.

878
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:23,684
(Sigh)

879
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,392
- Did you say it Doc'?

880
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:26,218
- I beg your pardon.

881
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:28,326
- You said it instead of he or she.

882
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:31,862
- Well, that's just a
figure of speech Sam.

883
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,500
Whoever did this is an animal.

884
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,032
Metaphorically.

885
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:41,009
And, I found this backdoor key

886
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,739
inside Jake's pocket.

887
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:51,147
- How many backdoor
keys do you own Doc?

888
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:52,318
- Just the one.

889
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:53,519
- Me too.

890
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,655
- So, how did those footprints walk

891
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,858
into a locked backdoor'?

892
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,161
- Am I missing something?

893
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:01,896
- Oh no, nothing at all Agent Manners.

894
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,665
I'm just having some
small town gossip here

895
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:07,026
about some tractor pulls
and a barn raising.

896
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,359
- Right.

897
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,003
Well our equipment does in fact
support your theory Sheriff.

898
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:13,775
The killer locked the door
himself after entering.

899
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:14,735
- He--

900
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:17,610
- Sheriff I'm
gonna need you to arrange

901
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,573
a curfew for the rest of the night.

902
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,212
It'll be safer for everyone involved.

903
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,610
- Are you gonna tell
me what this is about?

904
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:26,251
- I'm afraid it's on a
need to know basis Sheriff.

905
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,454
I'll have a task force
in here by midnight.

906
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,283
You just keep your townsfolk
out of my line of fire

907
00:42:31,616 --> 00:42:33,789
and we'll get along real fine.

908
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:35,256
- Sure.

909
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:36,223
- Now don't pout Sheriff.

910
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,532
You should be grateful.

911
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,095
You've got a madman on
the loose in your town

912
00:42:39,424 --> 00:42:42,132
and I'm gonna take him out for you.

913
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:45,705
(car engine)

914
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,237
- Sam.

915
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,444
- What's this?

916
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:54,909
- Federally approved curfew
regulations and procedures.

917
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:55,740
Yeah.

918
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:56,575
- Evening Sam.

919
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,478
I'm afraid I haven't got round
to turning the furnace on.

920
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,084
It's a trifle chilly inside.

921
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,253
- Let's get it fired up Father.

922
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,148
Is everybody here?

923
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:02,981
- Pretty much yeah.

924
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:03,815
- Yeah.

925
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:04,649
You seen Jill'?

926
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:05,960
- Uh, no a few of the
kids are still missing.

927
00:43:06,284 --> 00:43:07,319
- Well let's round 'em up all right'?

928
00:43:07,652 --> 00:43:09,757
Come on Father I want to
keep a close flock tonight.

929
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,659
(footsteps)

930
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,061
(applause)

931
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:25,277
Okay, now Father Branagh
tells me the heating

932
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,605
will be turned on any minute now.

933
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,976
(applause)

934
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,148
Folks, folks, we have a situation.

935
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,618
- Way to go Sam!

936
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:40,820
- All right now, let's just
setting down all right?

937
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:43,860
(footsteps)

938
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:45,599
(clanking)

939
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:48,369
(valve squeaking)

940
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:51,139
- That ought to cheer everyone up.

941
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,634
(footsteps)

942
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,501
- Under the advisement of
the local federal officers

943
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:58,871
I am going to put the town
under a 24 hour curfew.

944
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:01,308
Listen, I'm not gonna arrest you.

945
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,845
If you're just walking down the street

946
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:04,312
I'm not gonna waste my time but this

947
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,851
is for your own safety so
I urge you to follow it.

948
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:10,523
(yelling from outside)

949
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:11,792
Now Father Branagh has told me that

950
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:13,823
he'll keep the church open.

951
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:17,190
You can sleep down here
community style if you want.

952
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:18,330
That might be a good thing.

953
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,499
I want you to stay
off the phones except

954
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,634
in case of an emergency.

955
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:23,531
All right'?

956
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:27,169
What the heck is going on out there?

957
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,203
- It's uh--

958
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:31,204
- Paul Davrow.

959
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:37,851
- Fucker's a snowman.

960
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:40,213
(scuffling)

961
00:44:40,545 --> 00:44:42,047
- Paul, what are you talking about?

962
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:42,881
- No you don't understand.

963
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:43,715
- Paul.

964
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:45,322
- No, she had wires coming out of her.

965
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:46,355
She had little lights--

966
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,185
- Paul.

967
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,428
- It was a seven foot tall--

968
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:49,254
- Paul.

969
00:44:49,587 --> 00:44:50,088
- Oh god.

970
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:52,867
(shocked gasp by crowd)

971
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:53,828
Okay.

972
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:56,594
- Well bravo Sheriff.

973
00:44:56,928 --> 00:44:57,702
- You didn't have to do that.

974
00:44:58,029 --> 00:44:59,531
- I hope this isn't a
taste of what I can expect

975
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:02,504
from this town under your direction.

976
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:03,709
- It's nothing, all right'?

977
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:04,672
We'll take care of him.

978
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:05,673
- Well you better.

979
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:07,004
The man's a danger to the public

980
00:45:07,338 --> 00:45:09,284
and a possible
hindrance to my operation.

981
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:10,881
- Your what?

982
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:12,950
- You better get your
act under control Sheriff

983
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:14,847
or I'll have you replaced.

984
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:15,953
I would appreciate
it if all you people

985
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,624
would get off the streets.

986
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:21,191
Go darn a quilt or something.

987
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:23,624
(footsteps)

988
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,596
- What the hell's eating him?

989
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:29,063
- I bet ya it ain't his girlfriend.

990
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,203
You should have punched him out sir.

991
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,201
(Sigh)

992
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:36,102
- Joe, come here.

993
00:45:36,434 --> 00:45:37,071
Get ahold of Paul.

994
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,039
Take him somewhere will ya?

995
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,646
Let him cool off for a
while down at the jail.

996
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:43,475
- Come on Mr. Davrow.

997
00:45:43,808 --> 00:45:44,445
Okay.

998
00:45:45,643 --> 00:45:46,280
- Big nose.

999
00:45:46,611 --> 00:45:47,112
- Okay.

1000
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:48,947
- Sharp teeth.

1001
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:49,781
- Chris.

1002
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:50,956
- Yeah.

1003
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:52,317
- I want you to go up to Paul's place.

1004
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:55,096
Maybe you can
find out what set him off.

1005
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,160
- Uh, maybe I should help out Joe.

1006
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:58,228
You know, with
Paul 'cause he's a big guy

1007
00:45:58,556 --> 00:45:59,398
and he might be a little nasty later.

1008
00:45:59,724 --> 00:46:00,828
- Chris.

1009
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:02,569
- Right, I'm on it.

1010
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:06,066
Nah, sure Sam I'll go check it out.

1011
00:46:06,397 --> 00:46:08,104
I'll see what freaked everybody out.

1012
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,137
No problem.

1013
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,573
It's a madman on the loose.

1014
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:15,975
Hey Deputy Chris
Pullman captures madman.

1015
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:20,821
Get the madman be a
hero, fa la la la la la.

1016
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:21,816
Whoa.

1017
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:24,854
(breaks squealing)

1018
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:33,927
(car door opening)

1019
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:36,704
(ominous music)

1020
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:39,797
(car door closing)

1021
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:42,270
(footsteps)

1022
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:48,441
(creepy christmas music)

1023
00:46:48,773 --> 00:46:50,878
(footsteps)

1024
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:56,322
(creepy christmas music)

1025
00:46:57,715 --> 00:47:00,025
(footsteps)

1026
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:00,988
Okay.

1027
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:06,901
I've heard of stuff
happening, thermal updrafts.

1028
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:11,139
(banging around in trunk)

1029
00:47:11,462 --> 00:47:14,033
(ominous music)

1030
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:21,043
(sirens blaring)

1031
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:28,915
- Hey kids.

1032
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:29,883
- Hi.

1033
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:34,057
- Ryan, where's your mom?

1034
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:35,921
- She went home to get
some more blankets.

1035
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:38,358
- Did somebody go with her?

1036
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:39,258
- I don't know.

1037
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:40,330
Is she all right?

1038
00:47:40,658 --> 00:47:41,261
- Hey Joe!

1039
00:47:43,094 --> 00:47:45,768
(sirens blaring)

1040
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:55,506
(knocking on window)

1041
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,682
- <i>Sam'?</i>

1042
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:58,077
(knocking on window)

1043
00:47:58,409 --> 00:47:59,046
Sam?

1044
00:48:01,412 --> 00:48:02,356
Is that you?

1045
00:48:04,415 --> 00:48:05,189
Deputy?

1046
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,522
(water flowing from cabinet)

1047
00:48:09,854 --> 00:48:12,300
(ominous music)

1048
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:17,199
(water flowing from cabinet)

1049
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:25,573
(steam hissing)

1050
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,314
(screaming)

1051
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:28,139
- I got it.

1052
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:29,143
I got it.

1053
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:31,953
(steam hissing)

1054
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:48,666
(valve squeaking)

1055
00:48:48,993 --> 00:48:50,131
(ominous music)

1056
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:52,065
(Sign)

1057
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:52,999
Ice burst.

1058
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:56,238
Lucky Sam sent me, huh?

1059
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,811
- Don't you ever creep
up on me like that again.

1060
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:01,980
- You ought to get these
pipes fixed Mrs. Tyler.

1061
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:06,277
- (Chuckle) We ought to fix you Joe.

1062
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:10,082
(water dripping from paper towel)

1063
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:13,258
- I think we're gonna
need a mop on this one.

1064
00:49:13,584 --> 00:49:16,360
- And the roadblocks at
4th and Lacy completely

1065
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:17,859
seal off main avenue.

1066
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:19,259
- You're forgetting the church.

1067
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:21,092
- No Sheriff, the
blockade is complete.

1068
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:23,701
- No, Father Branagh removed the fence

1069
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:25,530
here from the cemetery last week so this

1070
00:49:25,863 --> 00:49:27,501
is all open field now.

1071
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:32,975
- All right, thank you
very much Sheriff.

1072
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:35,306
Anything else you
care to share with me?

1073
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,379
- No, not at the moment.

1074
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:40,484
But if I think of something
you'll be the first to know.

1075
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,188
- After you get that done though

1076
00:49:42,513 --> 00:49:43,856
you want to get the fittings wrapped.

1077
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:44,989
You can do that yourself.

1078
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:46,693
Take some Teflon tape, no you can,

1079
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:48,826
you wrap the male fittings only.

1080
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:50,154
You don't wrap the female fittings.

1081
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:51,330
You've got to make sure you wrap them

1082
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,895
as you're looking down clockwise.

1083
00:49:53,224 --> 00:49:53,725
(car door opening)

1084
00:49:54,058 --> 00:49:54,559
You wrap them counterclockwise,

1085
00:49:54,892 --> 00:49:55,962
here you go Mrs. Tyler.

1086
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:57,897
Then all the tape shreds off.

1087
00:49:58,229 --> 00:49:59,640
Also I noticed that your linoleum's

1088
00:49:59,964 --> 00:50:00,908
starting to peel up there from all

1089
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:02,370
the water being on down there--

1090
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,906
(car door closing)

1091
00:50:04,235 --> 00:50:06,374
(footsteps)

1092
00:50:08,072 --> 00:50:08,709
(car door opening)

1093
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:11,645
Get some caulk and get that
back down there real easy.

1094
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:13,148
Silicon caulk is
probably better than--

1095
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:15,081
(car door closing)

1096
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:18,393
(car engine starting)

1097
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,924
(ominous music)

1098
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:32,173
- I don't think they saw us.

1099
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:34,271
- Jill, I don't know about this.

1100
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:35,838
I don't think it's such a good idea.

1101
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:39,170
- Come on, you want me
to have fun don't you'?

1102
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:41,915
Or do you want me to sit
around and get morbid'?

1103
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:44,549
- Jill, this is Sheriff Tyler's house.

1104
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:45,512
- Exactly.

1105
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:49,282
Are you gonna come or not?

1106
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:53,357
(footsteps)

1107
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:55,788
- Jill.

1108
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,191
(crashing)

1109
00:50:58,522 --> 00:50:59,967
(door opening)

1110
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:01,361
No, no, no, no.

1111
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,437
Don't turn on the lights.

1112
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:08,073
- I'll get all scared of the dark.

1113
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:09,139
(Sigh)

1114
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:13,471
And then I'll need a really
big boy to look after me.

1115
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:15,442
(nervous laughter)

1116
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:16,410
. Big boy?

1117
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:20,653
You're getting there.

1118
00:51:20,978 --> 00:51:23,618
(christmas music)

1119
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:29,461
(unzipping jacket)

1120
00:51:31,155 --> 00:51:35,262
(christmas music
and zippers unzipping)

1121
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,688
(christmas music)

1122
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:20,047
- If you want me
I want a roaring log fire

1123
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,612
and a bottle of wine.

1124
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:27,620
(heavy Sigh)

1125
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:30,516
Come and get me when you're ready.

1126
00:52:30,848 --> 00:52:32,953
(heavy Sigh)

1127
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:34,387
- Yes.

1128
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:37,699
If I wasn't anymore ready I'd explode.

1129
00:52:38,856 --> 00:52:42,702
(radio playing and blow dryer)

1130
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:54,344
(cork popping)

1131
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:55,980
Shit.

1132
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:57,376
(heavy Sigh)

1133
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,381
(radio playing and blow dryer)

1134
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:03,021
(pouring wine into glass)

1135
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:10,991
(spitting wine into sink)

1136
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:11,856
Need some ice.

1137
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:15,898
(glass bottle hitting counter)

1138
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:19,701
(fridge door opening)

1139
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,169
(footsteps)

1140
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:26,047
(digging in drawer)

1141
00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:31,342
(wind blowing)

1142
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,920
(chipping away at ice)

1143
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:54,598
(ice clinking in glass)

1144
00:53:54,932 --> 00:53:57,412
(ominous music)

1145
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:03,050
(snowball hitting window)

1146
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:05,444
(blow dryer)

1147
00:54:05,776 --> 00:54:08,256
(radio playing)

1148
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:16,822
(blow dryer)

1149
00:54:17,154 --> 00:54:18,132
Sheriff Tyler'?

1150
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:22,597
Sheriff, it's Tommy Davrow.

1151
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:25,903
Look, uh, I'm not a burglar.

1152
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,410
(ominous music)

1153
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:30,768
Sheriff?

1154
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,240
(ominous music)

1155
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:34,480
(pulling drawer open)

1156
00:54:34,805 --> 00:54:36,182
(ominous music)

1157
00:54:36,507 --> 00:54:39,317
(digging in drawer)

1158
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:48,756
(wind blowing)

1159
00:54:49,086 --> 00:54:51,327
(digging in drawer)

1160
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:54,135
(ominous music)

1161
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,662
(door slamming shut)

1162
00:54:57,995 --> 00:54:59,303
Who's out there?

1163
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,871
(ominous music)

1164
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:04,372
I said, who's out there?

1165
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:07,181
(ominous music)

1166
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:43,074
(door creaking open)

1167
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,088
Who's out there?

1168
00:55:48,412 --> 00:55:50,892
(ominous music)

1169
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:01,669
I said, who's out there?

1170
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:05,936
(heavy metal music)

1171
00:56:06,263 --> 00:56:08,174
- Well it ain't fucking Frosty.

1172
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:11,274
(heavy metal music)

1173
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:14,880
- You stay back man, all right?

1174
00:56:15,172 --> 00:56:17,550
I'm gonna use this thing, all right?

1175
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,377
Listen, just stay back.

1176
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:20,279
Just--

1177
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:22,750
(screaming)

1178
00:56:26,283 --> 00:56:27,057
- Ah.

1179
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:29,757
- What the hell are you?

1180
00:56:30,087 --> 00:56:32,897
- World's most pissed off snow cone.

1181
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:34,967
No, no!

1182
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:37,294
(heavy metal music)

1183
00:56:37,628 --> 00:56:38,402
(groaning)

1184
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:42,108
Well what do you know,
armed and dangerous.

1185
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,073
Bottom of the ninth, four dead,

1186
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,882
here's the windup and the pitch.

1187
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:49,807
(screaming)

1188
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,711
Woo hoo, it's a long drive.

1189
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:55,080
(laughter)

1190
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:04,591
(rock music and blow dryer)

1191
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:07,129
(rock music)

1192
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:23,578
- Thank you Tommy.

1193
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:26,114
(rock music)

1194
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:17,196
(ominous music and
water sloshing in tub)

1195
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:29,048
Tommy no.

1196
00:58:29,373 --> 00:58:30,716
Don't put cold water in.

1197
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:32,247
Oh it's freezing.

1198
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,851
(screaming)

1199
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:41,026
(fast paced christmas
music and screaming)

1200
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:55,935
(head banging into wall and screaming)

1201
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:10,250
(fast paced christmas music)

1202
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:14,551
(head banging into wall and screaming)

1203
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:20,729
(fast paced christmas music)

1204
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:29,775
- Looks like Christmas came
a little early this year.

1205
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:30,601
(laughter)

1206
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:33,813
Well, hope it was good for you honey.

1207
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:41,819
Oh I must remember to send flowers.

1208
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:43,947
(laughter)

1209
00:59:44,281 --> 00:59:46,761
(Paper tearing)

1210
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:55,566
(footsteps)

1211
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,973
- Hey, bad Manners, this is for you.

1212
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:01,901
Coffee?

1213
01:00:02,232 --> 01:00:02,733
- Yeah, please.

1214
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:03,976
Just to the brim.

1215
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:05,473
You heard from Chris yet?

1216
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:06,974
He was up at Paul Davrow's place.

1217
01:00:07,304 --> 01:00:08,339
- Not that I know of.

1218
01:00:08,672 --> 01:00:09,616
- Why don't you see if you can get him

1219
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:10,611
on the radio, okay?

1220
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:11,510
I'm worried about him.

1221
01:00:11,842 --> 01:00:12,479
- Okay.

1222
01:00:13,577 --> 01:00:16,023
- There's a storm
moving in over Denver.

1223
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:17,620
They can't get the
choppers off the ground.

1224
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:18,926
They'll be taking everyone in by road.

1225
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:21,286
(laughter)

1226
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:22,494
- No way, never happen.

1227
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:23,320
(laughter)

1228
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:24,791
- Might be a little late
but they'll be here.

1229
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:26,999
- Oh no, tell him Marla.

1230
01:00:27,324 --> 01:00:28,132
- No way.

1231
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,096
We're dead center
of the Snowmonton Bowl.

1232
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,772
It's 20 miles uphill in any direction.

1233
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:33,972
If it's anything like
last week you won't

1234
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:35,605
even be able to get a snowplow across

1235
01:00:35,932 --> 01:00:37,002
the highway in an hour from now.

1236
01:00:37,334 --> 01:00:40,042
- You telling me that there's
no way to get my men in here?

1237
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:41,713
- Duh.

1238
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:43,346
- [Stone] You can't let him escape.

1239
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:45,175
- Well don't you fret Agent Stone.

1240
01:00:45,509 --> 01:00:46,886
Nothing comes in, nothing gets out.

1241
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:48,883
Ain't that right Manners'?

1242
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:50,122
- Yeah right.

1243
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:54,354
Tell me Sheriff, what sort
of armory do you have here?

1244
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:55,321
- Armory?

1245
01:00:56,553 --> 01:00:59,830
- What kind of weapons
are available to us'?

1246
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:02,228
- We're just a small
town sheriff's office.

1247
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:04,004
- I told you conventional weapons will

1248
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,635
be useless against him.

1249
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:07,134
We need the company.

1250
01:01:07,464 --> 01:01:09,068
- Watch your mouth.

1251
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:10,173
- What are you two talking about?

1252
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,137
- Nothing Sheriff.

1253
01:01:11,468 --> 01:01:12,208
- I told you the company
should have been called

1254
01:01:12,536 --> 01:01:13,480
in to handle this whole thing.

1255
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:15,214
Not some bureau mercenary.

1256
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:16,813
- You want to let me in on this?

1257
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:19,051
- Sorry Sheriff, it's
on a need to know basis

1258
01:01:19,376 --> 01:01:19,979
and you don't.

1259
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:22,984
- Oh yeah, well I think
I might need to know.

1260
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:25,691
- Oh boys, Chris is back.

1261
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:28,018
I just heard his car pull up.

1262
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:30,092
- We're not finished.

1263
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,559
(footsteps)

1264
01:01:33,757 --> 01:01:36,704
(car engine idling)

1265
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:40,537
(footsteps)

1266
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:45,338
His car's here.

1267
01:01:47,504 --> 01:01:48,574
Where's Chris?

1268
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:54,450
Chris?

1269
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:10,564
Wherever he is he's soaking wet.

1270
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:13,465
- Hey Sam, isn't this
Jake Metznefls old scarf?

1271
01:02:13,797 --> 01:02:15,208
- Marla, Marla don't touch that.

1272
01:02:15,532 --> 01:02:16,636
- What's the problem Sam?

1273
01:02:16,967 --> 01:02:17,468
(laughter)

1274
01:02:17,801 --> 01:02:18,745
It's just a scarf.

1275
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:19,774
(laughter)

1276
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:21,138
(screaming)

1277
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:22,040
- Mother of god.

1278
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:23,612
- Nah, bitch couldn't make it.

1279
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,819
(gun shots)

1280
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:28,087
- I thought you said
conventional weapons

1281
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,719
couldn't touch that thing.

1282
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:32,117

- What was that?

1290
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,101
- What's this place made out of'?

1291
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,742
- Got quarter inch steel in the walls

1292
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:54,639
and the ceilings, half
inch plate in the windows.

1293
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:55,813
- That should hold us enough.

1294
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:57,243
- Enough for what?

1295
01:02:57,574 --> 01:02:58,177
Tell me.

1296
01:02:58,508 --> 01:02:59,350
- Sam, Sam all the
outside lines are down.

1297
01:02:59,676 --> 01:03:00,916
- We need something
to fig ht back with.

1298
01:03:01,244 --> 01:03:02,279
- What are we fighting?

1299
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,285
Look, I just saw something
that doesn't belong in this world

1300
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,025
and it's out there killing my friends.

1301
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:08,090
Now tell me what it is.

1302
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:10,086
- Jack Frost.

1303
01:03:11,588 --> 01:03:13,329
- No, Jack Frost died.

1304
01:03:14,424 --> 01:03:16,097
- Jack Frost changed.

1305
01:03:16,426 --> 01:03:16,927
- He changed'?

1306
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:17,795
Who are you people?

1307
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:19,334
And don't give me this FBI bull crap.

1308
01:03:19,663 --> 01:03:21,700
- Shut up, shut up, listen.

1309
01:03:23,033 --> 01:03:24,341
What is that?

1310
01:03:24,668 --> 01:03:25,669
(water flowing)

1311
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:28,175
- Sounds like water.

1312
01:03:28,505 --> 01:03:29,006
(water rushing under door)

1313
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:30,283

01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:38,224
Oh Lord, the footprint at
Jake and Sally's place.

1321
01:03:49,893 --> 01:03:51,167
Dammit it's not working.

1322
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,167
- He's only vulnerable
in his elemental state.

1323
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:54,474
- English Stone.

1324
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:55,833
- He can only be
hurt when he's frozen.

1325
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,236
- Well then he can stick himself right

1326
01:03:57,567 --> 01:03:59,205
back together again right?

- I can't authorize
this kind of action.

1354
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:50,520
- Nobody asked you to authorize it.

1355
01:04:50,854 --> 01:04:52,231
- Stop this now.

1356
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:53,465

01:09:45,081 --> 01:09:45,718
Oh my head.

1460
01:09:46,049 --> 01:09:47,221
- Your place or mine?

1461
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:48,051
- Yours.

1462
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:49,021
- Come on.

1463
01:09:49,986 --> 01:09:51,192
- [Male] What the hell was that Sam'?

1464
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:52,363
- It was a god damn snowman.

1465
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:53,360
- [Sam] Look, we're all gonna have to

1466
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:54,725
fight this thing together.

1467
01:09:55,058 --> 01:09:56,002
- [Male] Tell us what's out there'?

1468
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:57,668
- Look, I need everybody here to work

1469
01:09:57,994 --> 01:09:59,029
with me on this, all right.

1470
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:00,432
I need you to stay calm.

1471
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:02,106
I need you to trust these people.

1472
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:04,002
- Why in the hell should
we trust these guys?

1473
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:05,676
- Because we
mightjust be your only hope.

1474
01:10:06,002 --> 01:10:07,174
- That's right.

1475
01:10:08,271 --> 01:10:10,615
- [Paul] Sam, Sam wait, wait.

1476
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:13,215
(footsteps)

1477
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:14,715
- They're gonna send in
some kind of snowmobile

1478
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,114
two hours at most.

1479
01:10:16,446 --> 01:10:17,288
(phone slamming down)

1480
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:18,785
- [Sam] Too late, now cut the crap.

1481
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:20,185
I want to know who the hell you are.

1482
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:21,256
- Let's just say
we're in damage control.

1483
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:23,120
- You I don't care about.

1484
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:25,694
I want to know where you fit in.

1485
01:10:26,022 --> 01:10:27,126
Listen to me!

1486
01:10:27,457 --> 01:10:28,527
We're in this together.

1487
01:10:28,858 --> 01:10:31,395
That thing has got to be destroyed.

1488
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:33,799
What exactly are we up against?

1489
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:34,870
- Not even the Secretary
of Defense knows

1490
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:36,575
what I'm going.

1491
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:38,469
(gun shot)

1492
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:39,575
- Thank you.

1493
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:40,642
- No problem.

1494
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:41,914
- Do something.

1495
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:42,739
- Like what?

1496
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:45,382
Teach him how to shoot better?

1497
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:48,484
- Welcome to the team doc.

1498
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:49,881
Now talk to me.

1499
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,592
- Jack Frost was an accident.

1500
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:58,628
It was meant to be next
level genetic research.

1501
01:10:58,955 --> 01:11:00,434
To ensure the survival of our race

1502
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:02,236
through a global holocaust.

1503
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:04,060
I created an acid that would bond

1504
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:08,603
a human chromosome helix
with an inert material

1505
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:12,242
so that we could be
resurrected in the future.

1506
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:15,412
But something happened
in the accident.

1507
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:18,947
The snow didn't just
store Jack Frost's DNA.

1508
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,845
- It's taken on his personality.

1509
01:11:21,177 --> 01:11:21,951
- Exactly.

1510
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,484
You know what that means?

1511
01:11:23,813 --> 01:11:24,814
- It means he's killing my friends.

1512
01:11:25,148 --> 01:11:26,024
- No Sheriff.

1513
01:11:26,983 --> 01:11:29,862
It means that the soul exists.

1514
01:11:30,186 --> 01:11:32,166
And it's not just
some esoteric spiritual

1515
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:35,697
entity or even a
vague electrical force.

1516
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:37,834
The soul is a chemical.

1517
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:39,768
- You're insane.

1518
01:11:40,096 --> 01:11:40,767
This isn't what we could be talking

1519
01:11:41,097 --> 01:11:42,098
about right now.

1520
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:44,502
- Frost's manifestation is my proof.

1521
01:11:44,834 --> 01:11:46,177
It's invaluable, we cannot destroy it.

1522
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:47,879
- Don't you get it?

1523
01:11:48,204 --> 01:11:49,979
Jack Frost came
back here to get at me.

1524
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,307
And he's gonna kill anybody who gets

1525
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:53,018
in his path.

1526
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:55,151
If we don't destroy him he's gonna

1527
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:57,458
kill every last one of us.

1528
01:11:59,382 --> 01:12:01,988
- I have no idea how to stop it.

1529
01:12:07,223 --> 01:12:09,169
We have to contain it.

1530
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:10,129
- How?

1531
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:11,164
We have to put him
in an absolutely water

1532
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:13,633
tight container otherwise
he's gonna leak out.

1533
01:12:13,963 --> 01:12:14,464
We can't risk that.

1534
01:12:14,797 --> 01:12:15,332
- But to destroy it--

1535
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:16,643
- What do you want us to do Stone?

1536
01:12:16,966 --> 01:12:18,172
Wait till spring and see if he melts?

1537
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,208
- Wait, what about the
furnace down in the basement?

1538
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:22,140
Surely that's hot
enough to destroy him.

1539
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:23,313
- Well we tried blowing him up.

1540
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:25,050
It just pissed him off.

1541
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:28,548
- I suppose it's possible
that the sustained

1542
01:12:28,878 --> 01:12:30,380
heat could agitate the molecules

1543
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:32,590
sufficiently to destroy the helix.

1544
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:35,759
- Fine, fine, but how the hell
do we lure him down there?

1545
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:37,689
- We don't lure him.

1546
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:38,896
We force him.

1547
01:12:39,889 --> 01:12:42,836
(old western music)

1548
01:12:46,162 --> 01:12:47,334
- What if he doesn't show?

1549
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:50,439
- Jack was never one to miss a party.

1550
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:54,737
(old western music and footsteps)

1551
01:12:55,905 --> 01:12:57,009
You know I remember a night like this

1552
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:58,114
back in '79.

1553
01:12:59,175 --> 01:13:00,347
There were three of us holed up--

1554
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:01,677
- Shh, shh, shh.

1555
01:13:02,011 --> 01:13:02,785
- What?

1556
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:04,352
- You feel that?

1557
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,420
- [Manners] Feel what?

1558
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:07,125
I don't feel anyihing.

1559
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:08,622
- [Sam] You don't feel that?

1560
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:11,795
- A stampede of buffalo
coming over the hill?

1561
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:13,293
- What the hell is that?

1562
01:13:13,623 --> 01:13:16,433
(old western music)

1563
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:20,465
- I think Jack's about
to make an entrance.

1564
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:22,537
(screaming)

1565
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:26,642
(snowball crashing through doors)

1566
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:27,640
- Hey Jack!

1567
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:28,778
- What?

1568
01:13:29,105 --> 01:13:31,085
- You left a 7110 split.

1569
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,784
- Why you, oh shit.

1570
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:41,792
Can't we talk this over'?

1571
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:44,894
It's hot, it's hot,
oh great another one.

1572
01:13:45,221 --> 01:13:47,167
My hair is dry fellas.

1573
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:48,969
(valve opening)

1574
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:51,670
(fire roaring)

1575
01:13:51,994 --> 01:13:54,133
(screaming)

1576
01:14:00,403 --> 01:14:01,677
My face is melting.

1577
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:03,244
MY EYES, my nose.

1578
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:05,451
Oh that was--

1579
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:07,846
(screaming)

1580
01:14:10,346 --> 01:14:11,825
(furnace door closing)

1581
01:14:12,148 --> 01:14:12,853
No, no, no.

1582
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:16,324
(screaming)

1583
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,278
- We iced him.

1584
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,637
(cheering)

1585
01:14:41,877 --> 01:14:42,651
- Oh baby.

1586
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:45,352
- Is it finished?

1587
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:47,024
- Oh yeah, it's all gone honey.

1588
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:48,124
Poof like magic.

1589
01:14:48,451 --> 01:14:50,829
- I told you the snowman did it.

1590
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:52,496
- I need for you to get to a phone.

1591
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:53,857
We're gonna need some medical help.

1592
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:55,863
- I love you too.

1593
01:14:56,192 --> 01:14:56,829
- What about me'?

1594
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:58,832
- No, you're gonna
stick with dad, okay.

1595
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,539
Fastest blow dryer in the west.

1596
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:03,468
(laughter)

1597
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:07,747
(christmas music and steam hissing)

1598
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:22,822
- You know, at least you've still

1599
01:15:23,152 --> 01:15:24,893
got your records, right.

1600
01:15:25,221 --> 01:15:27,599
(christmas music)

1601
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:28,697
You know it's at a time like this

1602
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:32,939
when I think all we
can do is turn our eyes

1603
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:35,833
to the heaven's and say, oh shit.

1604
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:42,607
(ominous music)

1605
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:45,881
- Blow me.

1606
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:51,758
(moaning)

1607
01:15:52,081 --> 01:15:52,582
Frost bite.

1608
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:54,861
Next time we'll use mistletoe.

1609
01:15:55,184 --> 01:15:57,289
(screaming)

1610
01:15:58,387 --> 01:15:59,730
I need floss.

1611
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:02,229
- P-Please we know it's you Jack.

1612
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:03,969
- Bah humbug.

1613
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:05,203
- Wait, wait.

1614
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:07,732
I can help you.

1615
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:09,236
Maybe turn you back.

1616
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:10,873
- But I'm having so much fun just

1617
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,042
the way I am.

1618
01:16:12,368 --> 01:16:13,142
- Wait, wait, wait.

1619
01:16:13,469 --> 01:16:15,244
Then tell me what it's like to have

1620
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:18,814
breached death, a dream
of every man on earth.

1621
01:16:19,141 --> 01:16:20,484
You're immoral.

1622
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:21,618
How does that feel?

1623
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:23,321
- Oh it feels cold!

1624
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,427
(screaming)

1625
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:29,093
- Put it on your head.

1626
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:30,328
It's cold out here.

1627
01:16:30,653 --> 01:16:32,655
(footsteps)

1628
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:34,433
Listen I want you to wait
in here forjust a minute.

1629
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:36,896
I've got to talk to this guy.

1630
01:16:37,226 --> 01:16:38,466
Here.

1631
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:40,171
(car door closing)

1632
01:16:40,496 --> 01:16:42,635
(footsteps)

1633
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:46,770
(door creaking open)

1634
01:16:49,772 --> 01:16:52,150
(door closing)

1635
01:16:52,475 --> 01:16:54,614
(footsteps)

1636
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,948
(Creepy music)

1637
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:12,834
- Fuck it.

1638
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:16,635
