This isn't Cindy.

12
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,701
I think you have
a wrong number.

13
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:38,102
Uh, wait a minute.

14
00:00:38,202 --> 00:00:39,601
What number did I dial?

15
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:43,002
- Who is this?
- The Killer.

16
00:00:44,603 --> 00:00:48,703
- Is that yours or mine?
- Ignore it, I have voicemail.

17
00:00:48,703 --> 00:00:50,802
Do you like movies?

18
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:52,403
Yeah, sure.

19
00:00:52,403 --> 00:00:53,803
I rented some tonight.

20
00:00:53,903 --> 00:00:55,904
What kind of movies?

21
00:00:55,904 --> 00:00:59,204
The usual-- Vaseline Alley,
Two Guys and a Girl and a Horse,

22
00:00:59,304 --> 00:01:02,105
- A Big Black...
- I get it! I get it!

23
00:01:02,205 --> 00:01:04,605
Do you like
scary movies?

24
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:05,905
You mean like
Spike Lee movies?

25
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:08,905
Lay off the Spikester.
He's keeping it real.

26
00:01:08,905 --> 00:01:11,706
Let's play a game.
Do you like games?

27
00:01:11,706 --> 00:01:13,106
I guess...

28
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,606
Alright, a train leaves
Chicago doing 60 miles an hour...

29
00:01:15,706 --> 00:01:18,007
Math ! How am I supposed
to know that?

30
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:20,808
I'm a beautiful, popular, rich kid
with a promising future...

31
00:01:20,808 --> 00:01:22,607
...in a lightweight sorority
at a state college.

32
00:01:22,607 --> 00:01:24,508
I don't need to know that stuff,
I'm gonna get married.

33
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:25,808
Shut up!
Shut up, you nit wit.

34
00:01:25,908 --> 00:01:27,908
Do you think this
stalking thing is easy?

35
00:01:27,908 --> 00:01:29,509
- Whoa !

36
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:31,609
Are you in my pool?

37
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:47,811
Hello?

38
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:50,012
- Collect call from...
- The Killer.

39
00:01:50,112 --> 00:01:52,612
- Will you accept the charges?
- Whatever.

40
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,912
Go ahead.

41
00:01:53,912 --> 00:01:56,313
Killer: Thanks,
now where were we?

42
00:01:56,313 --> 00:01:59,013
- Now look, geek.
- No, you look.

43
00:01:59,013 --> 00:02:01,914
If you don't get this next question
right, you're dead meat.

44
00:02:02,014 --> 00:02:05,114
Who's buried in Grant's tomb?

45
00:02:05,114 --> 00:02:06,814
Ummm, Hugh Grant?

46
00:02:06,814 --> 00:02:08,915
I'm afraid not, genius.

47
00:02:08,915 --> 00:02:12,315
It was Amy Grant, wasn't it?
I was gonna say that!

48
00:02:12,315 --> 00:02:13,615
It doesn't matter.

49
00:02:13,715 --> 00:02:17,015
You didn't answer
in the form of a question !

50
00:02:17,015 --> 00:02:19,316
Hey, you're
not Marilyn Melons !

51
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,121
Hello.

52
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:54,321
Yeah, hold on a minute.
It's Stacey.

53
00:02:54,321 --> 00:02:55,521
H i.

54
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:56,722
Do you mind?

55
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:00,722
Nothing.
What are you doing?

56
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,923
Oh my God.

57
00:03:03,023 --> 00:03:05,823
What did she say?

58
00:03:05,823 --> 00:03:08,423
She is such a bitch !

59
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:10,800
I've got to go.

60
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,001
I'll call you back.

61
00:03:36,408 --> 00:03:37,609
Oooh. Oooh.

62
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,210
I'm melting.

63
00:04:44,128 --> 00:04:46,429
PA: Good morning,
students.

64
00:04:46,429 --> 00:04:49,930
Cheerleader try-outs
will be held after school today,

65
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,431
in the gym.

66
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:55,532
You must be 1 8 and comfortable
with partial nudity.

67
00:05:14,338 --> 00:05:16,238
- Did not.
- Did too.

68
00:05:16,238 --> 00:05:17,239
- Did not.
- Did too.

69
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:18,339
Did too.

70
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:19,339
Mom !

71
00:05:29,943 --> 00:05:32,443
Alright, Dawson.
If you'll just sign here,

72
00:05:32,443 --> 00:05:35,444
you'll be officially registered
at Bulemia Falls H igh School.

73
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:49,248
Hey, new kid !

74
00:05:51,248 --> 00:05:54,449
Slab, is that the way we introduce
ourselves to the new kid?

75
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:56,550
Sorry, Mrs. Peacock.

76
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,251
Ha !
Two for flinchin', New Kid.

77
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:06,053
H i, I'm Dawson.

78
00:06:06,653 --> 00:06:07,653
That's better.

79
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:12,155
Man: We have rules
at this school, Mister.

80
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:14,456
And "no" means "no."

81
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:18,357
I'm never gonna get laid.

82
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:23,458
Dawson, I'd like to introduce
you to Principal Interest.

83
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:27,660
Ahem.

84
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,060
Oh, I'm sorry.

85
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,461
"The Administrator Formerly
Known As Principal."

86
00:06:38,863 --> 00:06:39,763
Wannabe.

87
00:06:40,364 --> 00:06:41,864
Hey, New Kid !

88
00:06:43,265 --> 00:06:44,265
Oh God !

89
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:48,766
Looks like someone is gonna have
to show you the ropes.

90
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:51,867
Boner?

91
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:54,268
It's pronounced
Bah-ner, sir.

92
00:06:54,268 --> 00:06:56,068
The "O" is soft.

93
00:06:56,068 --> 00:06:57,769
Not according
to Resusci-Annie.

94
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:00,070
Just show him around.

95
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,171
And for God's sakes,
wash your hands first.

96
00:07:03,971 --> 00:07:05,872
Mary, you're next.

97
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:11,373
H i, I'm Boner.

98
00:07:11,373 --> 00:07:12,674
It's nice to meet you.

99
00:07:16,275 --> 00:07:18,475
Yeah? "Witch?"
Try "rhymes with..."

100
00:07:18,475 --> 00:07:20,876
Charmed my ass !
Call me.

101
00:07:20,876 --> 00:07:22,577
Goddamn Shannon Doherty.

102
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,578
Hey, New Kid !
I'm Barbara.

103
00:07:26,578 --> 00:07:29,879
- How'd you like a Hertz Donut?
- I'd love one. Thanks.

104
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:31,880
Ow!

105
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,080
H urts, don't it?

106
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:35,280
Hey, guys.

107
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,080
- H i Martina.
- H i, Mrs. Peacock.

108
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:40,581
Hey, New Kid.

109
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,191
Dawson: Wait a minute.

110
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,791
Is she...?

111
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:15,192
Did you hear the news?

112
00:08:15,192 --> 00:08:17,193
- Wrestling's fake?
- I'm not pregnant?

113
00:08:17,293 --> 00:08:18,993
He who smelt it,
dealt it?

114
00:08:21,594 --> 00:08:23,195
No, about Screw.

115
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,900
Slut. Whore.

116
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,000
Do you have her number?

117
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,301
Who?

118
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,901
Murdered. Gutted.

119
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:34,002
Flayed, sliced, diced,
fried and hung.

120
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:35,802
Jesus !

121
00:08:35,902 --> 00:08:37,903
I'm never gonna get laid.

122
00:08:38,003 --> 00:08:40,403
And it's all over
the TV and news.

123
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:43,804
Oh great!
Now everbody knows !

124
00:08:45,905 --> 00:08:47,305
Do they know who did it?

125
00:08:47,405 --> 00:08:49,105
Some guy in a ghost mask.

126
00:08:49,205 --> 00:08:50,405
That doesn't sound scary.

127
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,205
Store-bought?

128
00:08:51,305 --> 00:08:52,606
Ewwww!

129
00:08:58,607 --> 00:09:00,407
PA: Attention,
students:

130
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:03,008
The fight between the Bloods
and the Crips

131
00:09:03,108 --> 00:09:05,909
is postponed
until next Friday.

132
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:09,209
Refreshments and
a lovely dance will follow.

133
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:12,410
At least
I feel safe here.

134
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,610
Hi, Chuckie !

135
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,411
Wanna play?

136
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:17,110
We'll be okay
at school.

137
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,811
Nothing can happen
to us here.

138
00:09:31,414 --> 00:09:33,314
This is the kind of thing
you read about.

139
00:09:33,314 --> 00:09:34,415
Books are pretty.

140
00:09:34,415 --> 00:09:35,915
Oh my God, he's right.

141
00:09:36,015 --> 00:09:38,515
What's the big deal?
Kids get killed everyday.

142
00:09:38,615 --> 00:09:39,815
This is high s chool.

143
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:44,217
Slab: No, Dawson.
This kid was white.

144
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,217
So?

145
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,217
And, she was popular--
like me.

146
00:09:48,517 --> 00:09:49,817
Ohhh.

147
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:55,119
I hope that's
Barbara Walters.

148
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:56,419
What a rack.

149
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:59,620
H i, I'm Hagatha Utslay
from Empty-V News.

150
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,721
Kids, what do you
think about...

151
00:10:02,721 --> 00:10:04,921
Wait, is that Dawson?

152
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,521
Tape this.

153
00:10:06,521 --> 00:10:10,622
Chop, chop,
you fat rat bastard !

154
00:10:10,722 --> 00:10:13,223
I'm Hagatha U tsley live
from Bulemia Fall H igh...

155
00:10:13,323 --> 00:10:15,823
where we're surrounded here by
a group of "innocent" students,

156
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,723
most importantly,
Dawson Deery.

157
00:10:17,823 --> 00:10:19,024
Student, drum major...

158
00:10:19,024 --> 00:10:20,824
...and inspiration for
my best-selling book

159
00:10:20,824 --> 00:10:22,625
" Dawson Is A Murderer."

160
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:25,725
- That book sucked.
- Not according to Oprah.

161
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,225
It was her pick
of the month.

162
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:29,026
So was "Chicken Soup
for the Butt."

163
00:10:29,126 --> 00:10:30,826
That doesn't mean
I killed anyone.

164
00:10:30,826 --> 00:10:32,327
Stay away from me.

165
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:34,626
Isn't it true
that your whole entire family

166
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:36,827
was murdered under
mysterious circumstances

167
00:10:36,827 --> 00:10:39,528
while you were supposedly
at "camp"?

168
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:44,328
- H uh?
- H uh?

169
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,131
- Ooh !
- Bitch went down !

170
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:52,731
Just like home !

171
00:10:53,531 --> 00:10:56,231
Yeah that, and they didn't
have a boxing team.

172
00:10:56,731 --> 00:10:58,632
Guys, that is no way
to treat a lady.

173
00:10:58,732 --> 00:11:01,133
U nless she burns the toast.

174
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:03,133
That's no lady.

175
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:04,633
What are you doing
here anyway, Doughy?

176
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:05,833
You're not a real cop.

177
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:07,334
Shouldn't you be guarding
the Orange Julius.

178
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,434
NYPD Gap,

179
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,934
Sergeant Sears,

180
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:11,235
food court police.

181
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:12,835
How many times
have I told you guys,

182
00:11:12,935 --> 00:11:17,136
mall se curity is just as
important as real police.

183
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:18,636
It is !

184
00:11:18,736 --> 00:11:20,337
Loitering and stealing
pennies from the fountain

185
00:11:20,437 --> 00:11:21,737
are serious crimes that carry--

186
00:11:21,737 --> 00:11:23,237
Mom says you're a loser anyway.

187
00:11:23,237 --> 00:11:24,637
Well, Mom says you have
a fat ass.

188
00:11:24,737 --> 00:11:26,238
Dad left be cause he hated you.

189
00:11:26,238 --> 00:11:27,538
No, he left be cause
he hated you.

190
00:11:27,638 --> 00:11:29,338
He wasn't even your
real dad anyway.

191
00:11:29,338 --> 00:11:30,739
You know, I read your diary,

192
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:33,039
Miss "Boo hoo, my gym teacher
molested me."

193
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:34,239
- Dork.
- Dyke.

194
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:37,340
What?

195
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,341
Excuse me, I don't mean
to interrupt this family reunion,

196
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:44,541
but are you actually working
on this case, officer?

197
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:46,342
Primessuspekt.
Doughy Primessuspekt.

198
00:11:46,442 --> 00:11:47,742
And, yes I am.

199
00:11:47,742 --> 00:11:49,243
It te chnically, falls under
my jurisdiction be cause

200
00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:51,543
"The Killer's" costume was stolen
from the Spencers at my mall,

201
00:11:51,643 --> 00:11:55,144
that, and some whoopee
cushions and some fake dog shit.

202
00:11:55,244 --> 00:11:57,944
Pardon me, "canine" shit,

203
00:11:57,944 --> 00:11:59,445
who cares about that crap?

204
00:11:59,445 --> 00:12:00,645
I do.

205
00:12:00,745 --> 00:12:03,245
A cool kid was gutted
last night.

206
00:12:03,345 --> 00:12:05,646
Come on, it's probably some
harmless high s chool prank.

207
00:12:05,746 --> 00:12:07,846
Look, this is lame.

208
00:12:07,846 --> 00:12:08,947
Let's get out of here.

209
00:12:08,947 --> 00:12:10,147
Hey, you guys, I got an idea !

210
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:12,347
Let's all make a pact
to lose our virginities

211
00:12:12,347 --> 00:12:14,247
before graduation.

212
00:12:14,348 --> 00:12:15,748
I'm in.

213
00:12:15,748 --> 00:12:18,049
In unison:
We're not.

214
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:19,249
Yeah, me neither.

215
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,301
Yeah !

216
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:26,101
Little bastards.

217
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:27,602
I could just kill 'em.

218
00:12:27,702 --> 00:12:28,802
Yeah, but you didn't,
did you?

219
00:12:28,902 --> 00:12:30,002
I'm just kidding you.

220
00:12:30,002 --> 00:12:33,903
No really--
You didn't kill them, did you?

221
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,203
So, you're one of those
network reporters, huh?

222
00:12:36,203 --> 00:12:37,504
Actually cable.

223
00:12:37,604 --> 00:12:38,904
But that's just as important.

224
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:40,205
Oh, it's more important.

225
00:12:40,205 --> 00:12:42,204
Be cause on cable you can
see butts and boobies,

226
00:12:42,204 --> 00:12:43,705
and you can say bullshit
and bastard.

227
00:12:43,705 --> 00:12:46,405
So, do you actually have
any inside dirt?

228
00:12:46,405 --> 00:12:48,606
As a matter of fact, I do.

229
00:12:56,007 --> 00:12:57,508
Killer boots.

230
00:12:57,508 --> 00:13:00,308
Thanks, I like yours too.

231
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:01,708
Thanks.

232
00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:06,010
I guess I'll see you later.

233
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,609
I hope so.

234
00:13:07,609 --> 00:13:09,910
- Oh, sorry.
- That's okay.

235
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,910
Come on, lard-ass !

236
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:17,511
I'm gonna keep
my eye on her.

237
00:13:17,511 --> 00:13:19,212
She's got class.

238
00:13:46,017 --> 00:13:49,418
Attention students:
The band fundraiser

239
00:13:49,518 --> 00:13:52,718
will be held next Thursday
in the auditorium.

240
00:13:52,718 --> 00:13:55,819
Lick'er in the front,
poker in the rear.

241
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:17,623
I didn't do it!

242
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:18,823
We didn't say you did it.

243
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:20,524
Boner, you couldn't get laid
at Lilith Fair...

244
00:14:20,524 --> 00:14:22,124
much less kill somebody.

245
00:14:22,124 --> 00:14:22,925
I could too.

246
00:14:22,925 --> 00:14:25,724
Well, kill somebody I mean.

247
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:28,225
I could kill all of you.

248
00:14:32,427 --> 00:14:33,427
But I wouldn't.

249
00:14:33,427 --> 00:14:34,626
Oh.

250
00:14:34,626 --> 00:14:36,127
That's what I'm saying.
I didn't do it.

251
00:14:36,327 --> 00:14:37,327
Now Slab...

252
00:14:39,028 --> 00:14:40,428
he's a killer.

253
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:42,528
Just look at those earlobes.

254
00:14:44,428 --> 00:14:46,029
Way low.

255
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,030
Really?

256
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,531
H mmm. Skinny mirror.

257
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,034
That guy looks really familiar.

258
00:15:11,034 --> 00:15:13,234
That's Spacey, Dawson.

259
00:15:13,334 --> 00:15:15,035
He's banging the French teacher.

260
00:15:15,035 --> 00:15:16,235
Really?

261
00:15:16,335 --> 00:15:17,735
She's from France.

262
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:19,335
Paris, France.

263
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,336
Madame La Tourneau.

264
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:23,236
Yeah, he says
the sex is awesome.

265
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:25,537
Lucky dog.

266
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:28,037
Au revoir, Spacey.

267
00:15:28,037 --> 00:15:30,738
Call me later.

268
00:15:30,738 --> 00:15:32,838
Say bye-bye to Pa-pa.
Bye-bye.

269
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:38,439
- Hey, Martina.
- No, Boner.

270
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,440
Hey, Dawson, do you have
any lotion I can borrow?

271
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,641
It's for my rash.

272
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:50,242
I've got to go to class.

273
00:15:57,943 --> 00:16:00,643
Okay.
Okay, settle down, class.

274
00:16:00,943 --> 00:16:04,244
Settle down. Settle down.
That's it. That's it.

275
00:16:04,244 --> 00:16:06,445
I'm your substitute,
Mrs. Tingle.

276
00:16:08,746 --> 00:16:11,145
Today we're going
to be studying

277
00:16:11,145 --> 00:16:13,646
about the perse cution
of the Jewish people.

278
00:16:18,146 --> 00:16:20,747
Who can tell me what the verb
is in this sentence?

279
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:26,248
Sabrina? Moesha? Daria?

280
00:16:26,348 --> 00:16:29,249
Ooh? Eeh? Ooh ah ah?

281
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:48,753
Who can tell me if Frankenstein
was circumcised?

282
00:16:49,653 --> 00:16:52,753
Martina? Don't forget to give
Grandma her laxative.

283
00:16:52,753 --> 00:16:54,654
I won't.

284
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,658
Slab, I think you've had enough.

285
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,758
Why?

286
00:17:15,758 --> 00:17:17,958
Be cause you won't have
any room for beer.

287
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:24,260
Whew, that was close.

288
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,260
Man, if I wre cked,
my dad would kill me.

289
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,460
Hand me a beer.

290
00:17:29,761 --> 00:17:31,961
Guys, I think our senior year
is going to be the best ever.

291
00:17:31,961 --> 00:17:35,162
I'm the new Kielbasa queen.

292
00:17:35,162 --> 00:17:38,362
I just got accepted to
Harv ard Law School, baby.

293
00:17:38,362 --> 00:17:40,763
I just got a foreign exchange
student living in my house.

294
00:17:40,763 --> 00:17:42,264
She's Swedish !

295
00:17:42,364 --> 00:17:44,463
- And I just got a D in math !
- Yeah !

296
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:46,864
Slab! Look out!

297
00:17:54,165 --> 00:17:56,366
I think I hit something.

298
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:02,967
I think I'm going to be sick.

299
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:06,468
Yup, I've got a fever.

300
00:18:07,068 --> 00:18:09,968
Slab, you've got blood
all over you.

301
00:18:10,969 --> 00:18:13,269
Oh, that's no problem.

302
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:14,770
It comes out with
a little tequila.

303
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,871
Old s cout trick.

304
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:19,470
Slab, give me a hand.

305
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,971
Wasn't that trophy enough?

306
00:18:21,071 --> 00:18:23,271
Yes, but we have
to dump this deer.

307
00:18:23,271 --> 00:18:24,572
Alright, sweetie.

308
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:31,973
Can everybody keep a se cret?

309
00:18:47,676 --> 00:18:49,877
Mar-teeen-ahhhhhhhhhhh.

310
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,601
Yes.
This never happened.

311
00:19:07,302 --> 00:19:10,403
Who can tell me how
to conjugate the verb "expire"?

312
00:19:19,405 --> 00:19:20,505
" Doughy."

313
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:23,206
That's an interesting name.

314
00:19:23,206 --> 00:19:24,606
Thanks.
It's my dad's name.

315
00:19:24,606 --> 00:19:25,806
He's a baker.

316
00:19:27,406 --> 00:19:30,707
Hagatha.
Now that's a beautiful name.

317
00:19:31,108 --> 00:19:33,407
Thanks.
My friends calls me Hag.

318
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:35,608
Oh, do they?
That's so cute.

319
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:38,609
Dammit! She's flat!

320
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:44,810
Actually, they're C cups.

321
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,810
I guess I got to get
these things redone.

322
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,310
Doughy.

323
00:19:54,812 --> 00:19:57,312
Doughy...

324
00:19:57,312 --> 00:20:00,213
I was wondering, how did you get
into this line of work?

325
00:20:00,213 --> 00:20:02,713
Well, I got too fat
for the ballet,

326
00:20:02,813 --> 00:20:04,413
and I could never
get my bulge right,

327
00:20:04,513 --> 00:20:06,614
so I figured,
"What the hell?"

328
00:20:09,414 --> 00:20:10,715
Hagatha...

329
00:20:13,015 --> 00:20:14,515
Do you have a boyfriend?

330
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:17,016
Well, not yet.

331
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:18,616
Mail order, huh?

332
00:20:18,616 --> 00:20:20,417
I tried that a few times myself.

333
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:24,117
If it doesn't work out,
would you let me know?

334
00:20:25,117 --> 00:20:26,518
I sure will.

335
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:27,318
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

336
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:35,420
Okay, Tiffany, Amber,
into the chair.

337
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,620
Come on, shake it!

338
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,522
Ladies...

339
00:20:49,022 --> 00:20:50,522
Now, I need a volunteer.

340
00:20:50,522 --> 00:20:53,523
Boner, you look like a victim.
You're up.

341
00:20:53,523 --> 00:20:57,824
B-But, Mr. Hasselhof,
I-I can't swim...

342
00:20:57,824 --> 00:21:00,324
- Perfe ct.
- No!

343
00:21:03,324 --> 00:21:04,325
Parko!

344
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,926
I want to live.

345
00:21:11,026 --> 00:21:12,626
Oh yeah, I want to live...

346
00:21:14,527 --> 00:21:15,927
Yeah, right now, please !

347
00:21:22,828 --> 00:21:24,229
Yeah.

348
00:21:25,729 --> 00:21:27,629
Not so much tongue, Amber.

349
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:33,831
Now this is a textbook example
of mouth to mouth resus citation.

350
00:21:33,931 --> 00:21:36,030
Some of you may want
to practice this at home.

351
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,231
Or, if you'd like
to stay after class,

352
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:41,132
- I'd be more than happy to...
- Ewwwww!

353
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:42,832
Boner!

354
00:21:42,932 --> 00:21:44,632
It's Bah-ner, sir!

355
00:21:44,632 --> 00:21:45,332
Not at the moment...

356
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:19,639
You have to make sure
this gets to the governor

357
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:20,939
as soon as possible.

358
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,440
It's my last chance,
little brother.

359
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,040
Otherwise, I'll fry.

360
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,741
Don't worry, Jimmy.
You can count on me.

361
00:22:30,241 --> 00:22:31,342
Time's up, Boner!

362
00:22:31,342 --> 00:22:33,141
It's Bah-ner, ma'am.

363
00:22:33,141 --> 00:22:34,542
Not for long.

364
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:36,242
Dead Boner Walking.

365
00:22:48,944 --> 00:22:52,045
I hope you guys don't mind,
I may have to get home early.

366
00:22:52,145 --> 00:22:55,346
Me and Milli,
my Swedish exchange student,

367
00:22:55,346 --> 00:22:58,246
are about halfway
through the Kama Sutra.

368
00:22:58,346 --> 00:23:02,147
Awww, Boner.
I don't want to share you.

369
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:05,747
Yeah, what's she got
that we don't have?

370
00:23:05,847 --> 00:23:07,448
A twin sister.

371
00:23:09,248 --> 00:23:11,649
Slab!
Look out!

372
00:23:13,649 --> 00:23:15,750
Can everybody keep a se cret?

373
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:29,053
I'll fry.

374
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:36,754
Yes.
This never happened.

375
00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:45,256
I'm never going to get laid.

376
00:24:25,863 --> 00:24:27,563
Slab, I think you've had enough.

377
00:24:28,963 --> 00:24:30,464
Really, darling?

378
00:24:30,564 --> 00:24:33,665
Your concern is admirable,
but completely without merit.

379
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:35,364
I'm doing splendidly.

380
00:24:35,364 --> 00:24:38,665
Anyone read that article in the
Times Science se ction last week?

381
00:24:38,765 --> 00:24:41,866
Seems gene splicing
is all the rage.

382
00:24:41,966 --> 00:24:43,067
Slab! Look out!

383
00:24:45,366 --> 00:24:47,467
Can everybody keep a se cret?

384
00:24:52,668 --> 00:24:56,069
Slab, I'm looking
for your Uncle Lou's urn.

385
00:24:56,069 --> 00:25:01,670
We're s cattering his ashes
today. Have you seen it?

386
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,170
No.

387
00:25:10,471 --> 00:25:13,572
Yes.
This never happened.

388
00:25:20,473 --> 00:25:24,674
Shan... Shan... Shan... ah...
Shan... Shan... ah... kah.

389
00:25:26,774 --> 00:25:28,875
Shanakah. Chachi...

390
00:25:42,777 --> 00:25:46,679
Barbara, I'm afraid
it's worse than we feared.

391
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,378
- N urse Kevorkian, you mean...
- Yes, Barbara.

392
00:25:49,378 --> 00:25:52,179
You have chlamydia...

393
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:53,180
and gonorrhea...

394
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,380
and syphilis...

395
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,681
and crabs...

396
00:25:56,781 --> 00:25:59,180
Whew, I thought you were going
to say that I have herpes.

397
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,682
Oh yes, and herpes.

398
00:26:02,682 --> 00:26:05,082
Damn those Starbucks
toilet seats.

399
00:26:05,082 --> 00:26:08,782
Now young lady,
isn't there somebody spe cial

400
00:26:08,782 --> 00:26:11,283
you wish to make aware
of your condition?

401
00:26:11,383 --> 00:26:13,883
You mean a teacher?
Or, my dad?

402
00:26:13,983 --> 00:26:16,984
Well, I was thinking more
like a boyfriend...

403
00:26:16,984 --> 00:26:19,785
Oh.
Do you have a yearbook?

404
00:26:22,085 --> 00:26:25,586
Barbara, Barbara,
please take some advice

405
00:26:25,686 --> 00:26:28,787
from a women who's had some
experience in this area.

406
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,301
I wish to explain something
that we in the health profession

407
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:34,701
refer to as "hitting skins,"

408
00:26:38,202 --> 00:26:39,402
"knocking boots,"

409
00:26:41,303 --> 00:26:43,303
"doing the nasty,"

410
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:46,803
"bumping uglies..."

411
00:26:51,005 --> 00:26:52,705
I'm talking about sex, dear.

412
00:26:54,506 --> 00:26:57,706
Sex can be a beautiful,
sensuous experience

413
00:26:57,706 --> 00:27:00,907
between a man and a women
who truly love each other

414
00:27:00,907 --> 00:27:03,507
and want to share eternity

415
00:27:03,507 --> 00:27:05,907
laying in each other's
gentle embrace.

416
00:27:07,808 --> 00:27:11,409
Or it can be a dirty,
filthy spankfest

417
00:27:11,509 --> 00:27:15,410
in a bus station bathroom
shared by two anonymous

418
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,310
consenting adults
on a layover in Detroit,

419
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,010
and nobody ever need know.

420
00:27:21,211 --> 00:27:24,012
I think you got my point.

421
00:27:24,112 --> 00:27:26,513
Now, should we go and look
at your x-rays?

422
00:27:26,613 --> 00:27:28,712
X-rays with a pap smear?

423
00:27:28,812 --> 00:27:30,813
Oh, we're very thorough here.

424
00:27:31,713 --> 00:27:34,214
I just can't figure out
what this white spot is.

425
00:27:38,814 --> 00:27:41,915
You know, a pair of tube socks
works ever so much better.

426
00:27:41,915 --> 00:27:44,116
Why, when I was your age...

427
00:27:44,116 --> 00:27:47,417
I had this experience
I'll never forget.

428
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,017
There were three of us,

429
00:27:49,017 --> 00:27:51,417
three of us in one bed...

430
00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:57,319
Barbara, honey?

431
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:00,719
I'm expe cting Reverend Johnson
today, did he come yet?

432
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:02,420
Almost.

433
00:28:13,022 --> 00:28:16,023
Barbara, I could never
be as beautiful as you.

434
00:28:16,023 --> 00:28:18,324
Or swallow as much sausage.

435
00:28:18,324 --> 00:28:19,623
Can I have your autograph?

436
00:28:19,723 --> 00:28:20,724
Will you marry me?

437
00:28:20,724 --> 00:28:21,924
- No me !
- No me !

438
00:28:22,024 --> 00:28:24,625
Relax, there's plenty
of Barbara to go around.

439
00:28:24,725 --> 00:28:28,126
Today Ms. Kielbasa Queen,
tomorrow the world.

440
00:28:28,226 --> 00:28:30,726
Carmen Elektra,
watch your back!

441
00:28:31,026 --> 00:28:32,626
Slab! Look out!

442
00:28:33,727 --> 00:28:35,427
Can everybody keep a se cret?

443
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:47,430
Yes.
This never happened.

444
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:56,432
...and that's how I knew
I wasn't a lesbian.

445
00:28:56,432 --> 00:28:57,932
Now, Barbara...

446
00:28:58,032 --> 00:29:00,833
I think you need to take this
safe sex kit with you.

447
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:02,933
You never know when
you may need it.

448
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:04,233
I gotta go.

449
00:29:04,233 --> 00:29:06,734
Alright, but it may not
be here when you come back.

450
00:29:15,636 --> 00:29:16,736
H i, Doughy.

451
00:29:16,836 --> 00:29:18,136
- H i, baby.
- Chicken?

452
00:29:18,136 --> 00:29:19,637
A little, but it's my job.

453
00:29:22,338 --> 00:29:23,837
Do you have any
new suspe cts yet?

454
00:29:23,837 --> 00:29:26,038
Well, we're che cking out
everyone in town.

455
00:29:26,138 --> 00:29:27,138
Any new developments?

456
00:29:27,238 --> 00:29:28,839
Yeah, my v acation pictures.

457
00:29:31,139 --> 00:29:32,240
Who's that, your grandmother?

458
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,139
With the bong?
Yeah.

459
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:34,440
Glaucoma?

460
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,740
Spring break.
That's me.

461
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,441
Ooh, no tan lines.

462
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:41,042
- I feel like a hot dog.
- Footlong?

463
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:43,042
- At least.
- I'm buying.

464
00:29:48,943 --> 00:29:50,844
I've got a weird feeling,
Dawson.

465
00:29:50,944 --> 00:29:52,744
Wait till you eat
the tuna tacos.

466
00:29:52,744 --> 00:29:55,544
No, I mean Screw being killed.

467
00:29:55,644 --> 00:29:57,045
Oh, that.

468
00:29:59,445 --> 00:30:01,046
There's crazed a killer
on the loose, Dawson.

469
00:30:01,146 --> 00:30:03,647
That dead popular kid
could have been any one of us.

470
00:30:03,647 --> 00:30:05,246
But it wasn't.
So what do you care?

471
00:30:05,246 --> 00:30:07,347
What about next time he attacks?
And you know he will.

472
00:30:07,447 --> 00:30:08,847
Do you have a reserv ation sir?

473
00:30:08,847 --> 00:30:10,348
- Dawson?
- Party of five?

474
00:30:10,348 --> 00:30:12,148
- Wrong network.
- Yes, of course.

475
00:30:12,148 --> 00:30:14,049
Right this way, sir.

476
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:16,349
I wouldn't worry about
it so much if I were you.

477
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:17,049
Why?

478
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,349
Be cause you are with me.

479
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,050
Didn't your whole family
get chopped up

480
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,351
and fed to a fish farm?

481
00:30:24,351 --> 00:30:25,851
Allegedly.

482
00:30:27,751 --> 00:30:29,752
And what makes you think
you're so spe cial

483
00:30:29,852 --> 00:30:31,552
he'd want to kill you, anyway?

484
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:33,953
Well, be cause I got this.

485
00:30:35,353 --> 00:30:36,853
And how do you know it's a he?

486
00:30:38,053 --> 00:30:42,755
Be cause serial killers
and dentists are always men.

487
00:30:44,955 --> 00:30:47,055
I say rufies are bullshit.

488
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:49,756
I take them before every date
and I never get laid.

489
00:30:49,756 --> 00:30:51,757
Maybe you're not taking enough.

490
00:30:54,357 --> 00:30:55,958
You got one too?

491
00:30:56,058 --> 00:30:58,758
If that's what I think it is,
I got one.

492
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:00,858
A pres cription for
gyno-lotrimin?

493
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:03,259
Oh, wrong paper.

494
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,560
What does this mean?

495
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,460
I think I got one too.

496
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,560
What does yours say, Slab?

497
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:14,962
- Chanu...chanu...ah...kah...
- Give me that.

498
00:31:15,062 --> 00:31:16,862
That's it.
We're all targets.

499
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:19,662
Oh, God, I knew my beauty
would be a curse.

500
00:31:19,662 --> 00:31:23,864
The bottom line is, everybody
got a note. We're all in danger.

501
00:31:23,864 --> 00:31:25,364
Not everybody.

502
00:31:34,266 --> 00:31:36,667
Fine ! Happy now?

503
00:31:37,867 --> 00:31:40,067
You may already be a victim !

504
00:31:45,768 --> 00:31:49,370
Bad ! Bad Deer!
Bad, bad, bad !

505
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,801
No more salt lick.

506
00:31:54,901 --> 00:31:57,401
Deers don't talk!

507
00:32:18,806 --> 00:32:20,406
What's that?

508
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:21,907
Slab! Lookout!

509
00:32:26,007 --> 00:32:28,608
No!
I just ate.

510
00:32:30,308 --> 00:32:33,409
Yes, this never happened.

511
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:36,809
Wow! What did you win?

512
00:32:36,909 --> 00:32:38,310
Duh, Einstein.

513
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,610
It means Dawson's the first
one on the chopping block.

514
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,711
What a relief.

515
00:32:41,811 --> 00:32:43,811
Big deal.
Notes.

516
00:32:43,912 --> 00:32:46,311
It's probably just some
kid playing a joke?

517
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:49,712
I mean, after all,
it is Halloween.

518
00:32:49,812 --> 00:32:51,913
And Friday the 1 3 th.

519
00:32:52,913 --> 00:32:55,313
On the same day?
Impossible.

520
00:32:55,313 --> 00:32:56,613
Slab's dyslexic.

521
00:32:58,414 --> 00:33:00,215
Besides, a kid couldn't
write that.

522
00:33:00,315 --> 00:33:01,815
At least not a kid
in public s chool.

523
00:33:01,815 --> 00:33:03,415
U nless he was Japanese.

524
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:05,315
But they're not historically
serial killers.

525
00:33:05,315 --> 00:33:07,216
No, what about Godzilla?

526
00:33:07,216 --> 00:33:08,816
Not te chnically Japanese.

527
00:33:08,816 --> 00:33:10,617
He was born
in international waters.

528
00:33:10,617 --> 00:33:13,217
Ahhhh-so,
what are we gonna do?

529
00:33:13,217 --> 00:33:14,617
"We" nothing, dipshit.

530
00:33:14,717 --> 00:33:16,218
How do I know it's not
one of you guys?

531
00:33:16,318 --> 00:33:18,718
Well, we could all make
handwriting samples.

532
00:33:18,818 --> 00:33:20,019
Slab's out.

533
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:22,318
Woo-hoo! Not a killer.
Right here. Not a killer.

534
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:24,919
Wait a se cond,
just be cause he can't read

535
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,020
doesn't mean
he's not the killer.

536
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,521
- Yeah, look at the Clintons.
- What?

537
00:33:29,521 --> 00:33:32,121
No, this is stupid--
and you're stupid.

538
00:33:32,121 --> 00:33:34,121
Why would we want
to kill each other?

539
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,122
Yeah, so what if Slab
lost my term paper

540
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,022
after he copied it
and turned it in as his own

541
00:33:38,022 --> 00:33:40,023
and got an A?

542
00:33:40,023 --> 00:33:42,323
Yeah, and so what
if Barbara told everyone

543
00:33:42,323 --> 00:33:43,623
I got a small s chwantz?

544
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:47,124
Even though I don't.

545
00:33:47,124 --> 00:33:48,325
Exactly.

546
00:33:48,325 --> 00:33:50,425
So what if Boner's dad
was cheating with my mom

547
00:33:50,425 --> 00:33:52,925
leading to her downward
spiral into alcoholism?

548
00:33:54,526 --> 00:33:55,626
My dad is what?

549
00:33:56,426 --> 00:33:57,827
And you know what's
really strange?

550
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:00,526
Somehow The Killer always
knows where we are.

551
00:34:03,827 --> 00:34:05,228
You know what we've got to do?

552
00:34:05,328 --> 00:34:06,628
We've got to get out of here.

553
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:07,929
To some place safe.

554
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:09,329
Yeah, in the middle
of nowhere.

555
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:11,129
In the dark woods
and pouring rain...

556
00:34:11,129 --> 00:34:13,029
Without any adult
supervision...

557
00:34:13,029 --> 00:34:15,030
or police prote ction
anywhere in the near vicinity.

558
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,230
And I know just the place.

559
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,831
It's totally deserted
ever since

560
00:34:17,831 --> 00:34:19,730
those dorky kids
were dismembered.

561
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,531
Are you talking
about band camp?

562
00:34:21,531 --> 00:34:23,031
Wait a se cond--
This is stupid.

563
00:34:23,031 --> 00:34:24,932
Let's just all go
to one of your houses.

564
00:34:25,032 --> 00:34:27,533
Hey, that's cool.
My parents are out of town.

565
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:29,632
They won't bother us.

566
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:32,733
No, let's go to my house.

567
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:34,434
My parents are locked
in the basement.

568
00:34:34,434 --> 00:34:36,235
They'll totally
leave us alone.

569
00:34:38,334 --> 00:34:39,535
No, my house.

570
00:34:39,635 --> 00:34:41,635
My parents are divorced
and I spend the weekends

571
00:34:41,635 --> 00:34:43,336
with my dad, but he tries
to make up for lost time

572
00:34:43,436 --> 00:34:44,836
by letting me get
away with murder.

573
00:34:46,437 --> 00:34:47,936
Well, you know what I mean.

574
00:34:48,036 --> 00:34:49,937
Let's go to my house.
My parents are dead !

575
00:34:49,937 --> 00:34:51,437
Alright!

576
00:34:52,438 --> 00:34:54,738
Alright, so we'll stay there
the night, and we'll be safe.

577
00:34:57,938 --> 00:34:59,839
U ntil then, watch your backs.

578
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:10,841
Would the following
students please report

579
00:35:10,941 --> 00:35:12,242
to the principal's office:

580
00:35:15,243 --> 00:35:18,243
Lou Sur, and Heywood Jablome.

581
00:35:18,843 --> 00:35:21,344
Your reading s cores
are average, Jimmy,

582
00:35:21,444 --> 00:35:23,844
but, you're killing
on a 12th grade level !

583
00:35:23,944 --> 00:35:27,344
Congratulations, you're going
to do just fine at the seminary.

584
00:35:59,051 --> 00:36:00,252
How about that Michael Dunne?

585
00:36:00,252 --> 00:36:01,452
Now there's an ass
that won't quit.

586
00:36:02,052 --> 00:36:02,953
You're telling me.

587
00:36:03,053 --> 00:36:04,552
He's in my third period class.

588
00:36:04,552 --> 00:36:06,253
I'd like to jump his bones.

589
00:36:10,054 --> 00:36:12,254
Hey, did you finish grading
your term papers?

590
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:13,554
I was too hung over.

591
00:36:13,554 --> 00:36:14,654
Did you read any of yours?

592
00:36:14,754 --> 00:36:15,654
I never read them.

593
00:36:15,755 --> 00:36:17,055
Who does?

594
00:36:17,155 --> 00:36:19,356
Do you know where I could get
an unregistered handgun?

595
00:36:19,356 --> 00:36:21,256
You got 50 bucks?

596
00:36:21,256 --> 00:36:22,456
I can get it by Friday.

597
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:23,456
I'll see what I can do.

598
00:37:18,568 --> 00:37:20,668
## You'll have a fresh attitude ##

599
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,568
## When you're holding
your knife ##

600
00:37:22,568 --> 00:37:25,669
## With Mentals, fresh can be
your knight ##

601
00:37:25,769 --> 00:37:28,269
## Lady Luck will lift you up, ##

602
00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:30,470
## When you're sporting
fresh breath. ##

603
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,770
## Before you strike ##

604
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:35,471
## Death goes better
with Mentals freshness ##

605
00:37:35,571 --> 00:37:38,871
## Death goes better
with Mentals freshness ##

606
00:37:38,871 --> 00:37:40,372
## Death goes better ##

607
00:37:40,472 --> 00:37:42,873
## With you and
all you do with your knife ##

608
00:37:47,573 --> 00:37:50,574
Attention students:

Also, whoever put real meat

612
00:38:00,476 --> 00:38:01,877
please remove it.

613
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,501
Man, this car sucks.

614
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:08,501
What a pie ce of shit.

615
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:12,902
Hey, guys.
What are you talking about?

616
00:38:14,002 --> 00:38:15,303
Don't you see what I see?

617
00:38:15,303 --> 00:38:18,003
Why, this car's automatic !

618
00:38:19,903 --> 00:38:21,104
Systematic !

619
00:38:22,704 --> 00:38:24,505
It's hydromatic !

620
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:27,505
Why it's Greased Frightening !

621
00:38:28,805 --> 00:38:30,405
## I used to call you up

622
00:38:30,505 --> 00:38:32,106

## Yeah, keep on talkin'
Oh, just keep on talkin' ##

624
00:38:34,806 --> 00:38:36,606
## You know you bought
the farm but good ##

625
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,107
## When you're askin'

626
00:38:38,207 --> 00:38:40,408
## I want my mommy.
Oh, I want my mommy ##

627
00:38:40,408 --> 00:38:41,708
## With the four-speed

628
00:38:41,808 --> 00:38:43,307
## You're just waiting

629
00:38:46,308 --> 00:38:47,909
## ...Greased Frightening. ##

630
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:53,310
What a fag.

631
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,610
Let's go paint
it on his locker.

632
00:38:57,811 --> 00:39:00,311
Of course it's stupid
if no one else sings.

633
00:39:01,711 --> 00:39:02,812
Dicks.

634
00:39:33,418 --> 00:39:34,717
Mr. Andretti?

635
00:39:53,021 --> 00:39:54,722
No!

636
00:40:02,923 --> 00:40:04,724
No!

637
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:13,426
No!

638
00:40:22,327 --> 00:40:23,228
Great.

639
00:40:25,428 --> 00:40:27,028
What the s cratch?

640
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:32,830
Whew!

641
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,231
License and active warrants.

642
00:40:40,431 --> 00:40:41,631
There you go.

643
00:40:48,933 --> 00:40:50,733
May I have your
attention for the results

644
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:53,233

645
00:40:53,233 --> 00:40:55,734

Jonathan Weiner - negative.

648
00:41:05,136 --> 00:41:06,836
Did you know
that most serial killers

649
00:41:06,936 --> 00:41:08,137
have an extra chromosome?

650
00:41:08,137 --> 00:41:09,437
Really?

651
00:41:09,437 --> 00:41:11,437
Yeah, trust me.
I'm from Wis consin.

652
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:14,938
That's a really nice gun.

653
00:41:14,938 --> 00:41:17,138
Thanks, my mom bought it for me.

654
00:41:17,138 --> 00:41:18,839
I'm saving up for my bullets.

655
00:41:18,939 --> 00:41:21,739
- N ine millimeter?
- When it's cold.

656
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,039
You know a lot about this stuff.

657
00:41:23,139 --> 00:41:24,240
Well, I have to.

658
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,840
My demos show
that I'm most popular

659
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,140
with felons and bed wetters.

660
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,341
Perfe ct.
Then I'm your man.

661
00:41:31,441 --> 00:41:33,241
You do like to watch?

662
00:41:39,442 --> 00:41:40,843
Who doesn't?

663
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:55,945
"Sieg Heil ! Sieg Heil ! "

664
00:41:57,346 --> 00:42:00,847
Attention students:

668
00:42:08,048 --> 00:42:09,549
No parking.

669
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:15,049
Also, today's happy hour will
be held in the biology lab.

670
00:42:15,149 --> 00:42:19,151
Remember, wings are free
when you buy a pitcher.

671
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,861
And now we're
in the final turn...

672
00:43:11,861 --> 00:43:13,761
it's Martina and the Killer...

673
00:43:13,761 --> 00:43:15,561
the Killer making his move...

674
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:17,862
Now it's the Killer
and Martina.

675
00:43:19,963 --> 00:43:21,962
Martina now making her move...

676
00:43:22,062 --> 00:43:24,063
Now it's Martina
and the Killer.

677
00:44:18,074 --> 00:44:23,975
Attention students: There will
be a fire drill at 3:05 today.

678
00:44:23,975 --> 00:44:27,476
Please bring your own matches
and lighter fluid.

679
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,079
Ah-hh !

680
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,281
Oh.

681
00:44:56,282 --> 00:44:58,981
Two minutes to "show time."

682
00:44:58,981 --> 00:45:02,483
Or should I say "shower time"?

683
00:45:05,383 --> 00:45:06,883
Oh yeah !

684
00:45:07,683 --> 00:45:09,684
Come to papa.

685
00:45:13,185 --> 00:45:15,385
Slab?

686
00:45:15,385 --> 00:45:17,685
Dawson?

687
00:45:17,685 --> 00:45:19,786
Martina?

688
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,900
Eureka !

689
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,701
Alright!

690
00:45:44,703 --> 00:45:46,802
Wait a minute...

691
00:45:46,902 --> 00:45:48,303
What the--

692
00:46:05,906 --> 00:46:09,607
Okay, okay. Okay.

693
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:11,007
Faculty coming through.

694
00:46:11,107 --> 00:46:12,007
Hello!

695
00:46:12,107 --> 00:46:14,908
Aren't any of you
on the Internet?

696
00:46:14,908 --> 00:46:16,709
Put a leash on it, Tarzan.

697
00:46:20,209 --> 00:46:23,710
Hello, gang !
Welcome to Sex Education.

698
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:25,310
If you aren't registered
for this course,

699
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:28,610
or are a Southern Baptist,
you're in the wrong room.

700
00:46:34,312 --> 00:46:35,311
Ta ta.

701
00:46:36,312 --> 00:46:37,412
A churching we go.

702
00:46:37,812 --> 00:46:41,013
Okay, let's get started by
reviewing the basics, shall we?

703
00:46:41,013 --> 00:46:43,813
Who remembers my two friends

704
00:46:43,813 --> 00:46:47,114
Peter Longfellow
and Virginia Tulips?

705
00:46:48,215 --> 00:46:51,715
Hey, baby, you smell like beer.

706
00:46:51,715 --> 00:46:53,615
Oh Peter, please--

707
00:46:53,615 --> 00:46:55,916
I've always relied
on the kindness of strangers.

708
00:46:56,016 --> 00:46:57,616
Eat my stranger!

709
00:46:57,716 --> 00:47:00,916
Ooooh ! Ow! Daddy! Daddy!

710
00:47:09,018 --> 00:47:09,818
Yes?

711
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:13,419
Mr. Buchanan,
may I please be excused?

712
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:15,720
Couldn't wait till prom,
Ms. Delgado?

713
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,520
Go.
Go go go go.

714
00:47:22,821 --> 00:47:25,121
Alright, let's move on to
our film, shall we?

715
00:47:25,221 --> 00:47:28,822
I just need a volunteer to put
some fueler in the proje ctor.

716
00:47:31,023 --> 00:47:32,323
Anyone?...

717
00:47:32,423 --> 00:47:34,523
Fueler?...

718
00:47:34,523 --> 00:47:35,323
Fueler?...

719
00:47:37,824 --> 00:47:38,924
Yes.

720
00:47:38,924 --> 00:47:39,725
I'll do it.

721
00:47:39,825 --> 00:47:41,025
Sugar bugger.

722
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:43,125
There you go.
Knock yourself out.

723
00:47:43,225 --> 00:47:45,025
There you go, killer.

724
00:47:45,025 --> 00:47:47,626
You won't have any trouble
with those deltoids.

725
00:47:48,626 --> 00:47:51,126
Alright, where was I?

726
00:48:23,732 --> 00:48:26,633
The following motion picture
has been rated "X."

727
00:48:26,733 --> 00:48:30,334
It contains adult situations,
adult language and nudity,

728
00:48:30,434 --> 00:48:32,334
lots of nudity.

729
00:48:32,334 --> 00:48:35,235
Extensive pausing or rewinding
will damage film.

730
00:48:35,235 --> 00:48:37,336
Parental absence is suggested.

731
00:48:39,835 --> 00:48:42,736
And now for our feature
presentation...

732
00:48:42,736 --> 00:48:44,837
Hallmark Hall of Fame
proudly presents...

733
00:48:44,837 --> 00:48:48,337
Motley Screw:
The Pam and Tommy Story.

734
00:48:51,038 --> 00:48:53,439
Look, I'm driving the boat.

735
00:48:53,439 --> 00:48:55,739
Look, I'm measuring the couch !

736
00:48:55,739 --> 00:48:57,739
You look like a tripod.

737
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:01,840
Oh, would you look at that
choice of wallpaper!

738
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:05,040
Who is your de corator?
Mussolini?

739
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:09,241
Hey, no one is going
to see this, right baby?

740
00:49:36,147 --> 00:49:38,547
Do you mind practicing
somewhere else?

741
00:49:42,548 --> 00:49:46,148
Ow, this isn't going to help
my sore throat any, is it?

742
00:50:08,753 --> 00:50:11,453
Scissors cut paper.
You lose !

743
00:50:50,561 --> 00:50:52,462
Look, I'm polev aulting.

744
00:51:02,063 --> 00:51:04,863
Ah, that's why I don't
wear underwear.

745
00:51:06,964 --> 00:51:09,764
That was amazing
wasn't it, baby?

746
00:51:09,864 --> 00:51:12,165
I just love playing
naughty Killer

747
00:51:12,265 --> 00:51:15,166
and Prison Psy chiatrist
with you...

748
00:51:15,266 --> 00:51:16,966
but next time, don't pull
so tight...

749
00:51:16,966 --> 00:51:18,466
that's my good s carf.

750
00:51:21,067 --> 00:51:23,067
Let's see what
the kids is up to.

751
00:51:33,769 --> 00:51:35,569
That's what I'm talking about.

752
00:51:44,771 --> 00:51:46,471
Oh, I'm sorry, lover...

753
00:51:46,471 --> 00:51:48,472
Did I leave you hangin?

754
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:49,973
I know what we need.

755
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:52,672
Margaritas !

756
00:51:52,772 --> 00:51:54,673
That's what I'm talking about.

757
00:51:54,773 --> 00:51:56,700
See, it's me and you girl.

758
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:57,500
Alright!

759
00:52:00,301 --> 00:52:03,002
Hey, you kids,
knock off the grab ass.

760
00:52:04,602 --> 00:52:08,203
It's a good thing Principal
Winkler left that futon behind.

761
00:52:08,303 --> 00:52:11,604
Come on, I want to show
you a trick.

762
00:52:13,305 --> 00:52:15,506
Hey, what I just tell you?

763
00:52:17,206 --> 00:52:19,007
Let's go, man.

764
00:52:19,107 --> 00:52:21,107
I didn't see you come in.

765
00:52:21,107 --> 00:52:23,607
Well, what do we have here?

766
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:25,808
I was just boning up on my CPR,

767
00:52:25,808 --> 00:52:28,809
and I have a sore hip,
so we was in...

768
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:33,910
Hey, don't make me
come down there.

769
00:52:41,313 --> 00:52:45,514
Alright, that's it.

770
00:52:45,514 --> 00:52:47,114
Damn !

771
00:52:48,015 --> 00:52:49,015
Wannabe.

772
00:52:50,816 --> 00:52:52,716
Cherry v an, man.

773
00:52:52,816 --> 00:52:54,117
Thanks, I bought it from Jewel.

774
00:52:54,217 --> 00:52:56,117
It still smells
like peanut butter.

775
00:52:57,218 --> 00:52:59,218
Oh, my God !
We saw him !

776
00:52:59,318 --> 00:53:00,419
We all did.

777
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:02,619
Dawson's being interviewed
by the cops right now.

778
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:06,320
Yeah, but working
with William Kevinson

779
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,621
was a really great
experience for me.

780
00:53:07,721 --> 00:53:09,421
He's a brilliant guy.

781
00:53:10,722 --> 00:53:11,622
Got it?

782
00:53:16,123 --> 00:53:18,123
You're a very attractive man.

783
00:53:18,223 --> 00:53:20,024
Now s cram !

784
00:53:21,724 --> 00:53:24,125
I want to take that home.

785
00:53:30,527 --> 00:53:35,028
...two, one, and-- Welcome back
to Bulemia Falls H igh,

786
00:53:35,028 --> 00:53:37,829
home of Empty-V's
"Spring Break Massacre,"

787
00:53:37,829 --> 00:53:39,630
where we have live coverage
of the coolest murders

788
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:40,830
in the country...

789
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:43,031
and hot new videos
from the Backstreet Boys.

790
00:53:43,031 --> 00:53:44,931
- So, Doughy.
- Hey, baby.

791
00:53:44,931 --> 00:53:48,633
Officer Primessuspekt,
is it true that all

792
00:53:48,633 --> 00:53:51,033
the students got notes
from the Killer?

793
00:53:51,133 --> 00:53:52,334
U h-huh.

794
00:53:53,134 --> 00:53:55,235
Well, what does it mean?
Are they in danger?

795
00:53:55,235 --> 00:53:57,635
Well, I don't want
to s care anybody...

796
00:53:57,635 --> 00:53:59,436
but I'd say they are all
strong candidates

797
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:01,837
for a good old fashioned
ax in the head.

798
00:54:01,937 --> 00:54:03,437
Are we on live?

799
00:54:03,437 --> 00:54:05,238
Hey, dickhead,
get a shot of them.

800
00:54:11,739 --> 00:54:15,140
Officer Primessuspekt, are you
taking any extra pre cautions?

801
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:17,541
Don't touch me !

802
00:54:19,041 --> 00:54:21,542
And also we'll send a unit out
to whatever deserted location

803
00:54:21,642 --> 00:54:24,143
these kids are going to--
Where is that place, kids?

804
00:54:24,143 --> 00:54:26,543
Rock and roll !

805
00:54:52,952 --> 00:54:54,952
Hey, watch the ceiling fan.

806
00:55:01,554 --> 00:55:03,954
So, I grabbed the bastard
by his cheap costume

807
00:55:03,954 --> 00:55:06,555
and threw him up against
the wall and said to him,

808
00:55:06,555 --> 00:55:07,255
"You want the truth."

809
00:55:10,256 --> 00:55:13,057
"You can't handle the truth."

810
00:55:17,958 --> 00:55:19,859
So, do you want to go upstairs?

811
00:55:37,364 --> 00:55:39,465
H i, Doughy.

812
00:55:39,565 --> 00:55:40,565
Hey, baby.

813
00:55:40,665 --> 00:55:42,266
Are you all ready for tonight?

814
00:55:42,366 --> 00:55:44,567
Let's just say I've got
an itchy trigger finger.

815
00:55:44,667 --> 00:55:47,368
- Poison ivy?
- I showered at the Y.

816
00:55:47,468 --> 00:55:48,968
Bad soap?

817
00:55:48,968 --> 00:55:51,969
Yeah, I guess it's only
supposed to be used externally.

818
00:55:51,969 --> 00:55:54,770
So, how come you have
a rash on your finger then?

819
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:56,570
Well, I had to get it out.

820
00:55:58,170 --> 00:56:00,871
So, do think the killer's
going to show up?

821
00:56:00,871 --> 00:56:02,971
It's Halloween isn't it?

822
00:56:18,576 --> 00:56:21,977
Colle cting for the U nlucky
Fisherman's Association?

823
00:56:22,077 --> 00:56:24,578
Sorry, Dude.
I gave at the pier.

824
00:56:27,779 --> 00:56:29,480
Okay, so what do you guys
want to watch?

825
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:30,480
How about Teletubbies?

826
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:31,880
Nah, we don't have any pot.

827
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,381
Okay, we got Hot Shots,
The Naked Gun.

828
00:56:34,481 --> 00:56:35,882
Ooh, Airplane?

829
00:56:35,882 --> 00:56:37,682
I hear if you pause
it just right you can see

830
00:56:37,682 --> 00:56:39,183
Leslie N ielsen's penis.

831
00:56:39,183 --> 00:56:40,183
Ew!

832
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,000
Parodies are lame.

833
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,301
I'm gonna get some more beer.
I'll be back.

834
00:56:46,301 --> 00:56:47,301
What are you crazy?

835
00:56:47,301 --> 00:56:48,901
You can't talk like that.

836
00:56:48,901 --> 00:56:50,901
We are in a parody situation.

837
00:56:51,001 --> 00:56:52,202
What are you talking about?

838
00:56:52,202 --> 00:56:54,002
A parody.

839
00:56:54,002 --> 00:56:55,803
A killer in a The Killer costume

840
00:56:55,803 --> 00:56:58,002
slaughtering a bunch
of good looking, horny students

841
00:56:58,002 --> 00:57:00,803
at a ridiculously
named high s chool?

842
00:57:03,704 --> 00:57:05,405
Okay, had anybody seen "Scream"?

843
00:57:05,405 --> 00:57:07,105
Yeah, great flick!

844
00:57:07,105 --> 00:57:09,905
For Christ's sakes guys,
"EMPTY-V"?

845
00:57:09,905 --> 00:57:12,306
That's the worst pun
I ever heard.

846
00:57:12,306 --> 00:57:13,506
It's so easy.

847
00:57:13,506 --> 00:57:15,307
I mean, hello!
We all got notes--

848
00:57:15,407 --> 00:57:18,207
"I Know What You
Did Last Summer" !?

849
00:57:18,207 --> 00:57:19,707
That's not what mine said.

850
00:57:20,808 --> 00:57:24,509
- Chan...kah...Chan...
- Give me that!

851
00:57:24,509 --> 00:57:30,810
God, I haven't been so s cared
since I tried out for the WN BA.

852
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:32,910
Whatever. I'm not s cared.

853
00:57:35,611 --> 00:57:38,311
Oh, Cheap Shot!
There you are.

854
00:57:38,311 --> 00:57:41,312
Oooh, Cheap Shot.

855
00:57:41,312 --> 00:57:44,213
Now, I really need more beer.

856
00:57:44,213 --> 00:57:46,314
Come on guys,
look around you...

857
00:57:46,314 --> 00:57:49,213
Dawson !

858
00:57:49,213 --> 00:57:51,614
What? It's a family name.

859
00:57:51,614 --> 00:57:53,415
Are we gonna be tested on this?

860
00:57:59,416 --> 00:58:02,317
2 4 hour pizza--
If we're not here in 2 4 hours,

861
00:58:02,317 --> 00:58:03,217
we're not coming.

862
00:58:03,317 --> 00:58:04,617
Who ordered the large?

863
00:58:04,617 --> 00:58:05,718
I got it.

864
00:58:05,718 --> 00:58:07,717
No, no, no.
Hagatha, allow me.

865
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:08,918
No really, I got it.

866
00:58:08,918 --> 00:58:10,218
- No, I got it.
- No really, I got it.

867
00:58:10,218 --> 00:58:12,319
- Hagatha, allow me.
- I'll flip you for it...

868
00:58:12,419 --> 00:58:12,919
You're on !

869
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:19,220
Best two-out-of-three?

870
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,420
Okay.

871
00:58:24,021 --> 00:58:25,122
Alright listen.

872
00:58:25,122 --> 00:58:26,922
There are certain rules
you have to follow

873
00:58:27,022 --> 00:58:29,122
in a parody situation
if you want to survive.

874
00:58:29,122 --> 00:58:31,823
Okay, number one:
Exaggerate everything.

875
00:58:31,823 --> 00:58:33,623
N umber 88:

876
00:58:33,723 --> 00:58:35,424
Accept the ridiculous
as logical.

877
00:58:37,223 --> 00:58:41,425
Don't worry,
I know how to please a woman.

878
00:58:41,425 --> 00:58:44,426
Sexual sight gags--
always funny.

879
00:58:44,426 --> 00:58:45,426
We're almost there.

880
00:58:45,426 --> 00:58:47,926
Almost there.
Come on baby, yeah !

881
00:58:48,026 --> 00:58:49,026
Yes ! Yes !

882
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:53,928
Yes ! I got it!
Oh yeah ! Oh.

883
00:58:53,928 --> 00:58:56,328
And along with wacky
sound effe cts...

884
00:58:56,328 --> 00:59:02,129
Here's Boner.

885
00:59:02,129 --> 00:59:03,930
and unlimited absurdity...

886
00:59:34,636 --> 00:59:37,436
Remember, nothing is s cared.

887
00:59:37,436 --> 00:59:38,436
Damn it!

888
00:59:44,638 --> 00:59:46,938
Just perfe ct.

889
00:59:47,938 --> 00:59:50,639
You're forgetting
"Point out the obvious."

890
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:56,741
And finally, perpetuate
painful stereotypes.

891
00:59:56,741 --> 00:59:58,741
That's ridiculous !

892
01:00:02,342 --> 01:00:05,043
See, now that's Orion...

893
01:00:05,043 --> 01:00:07,142
and that's his penis.

894
01:00:07,142 --> 01:00:09,043
No, that's the Big Dipper.

895
01:00:09,143 --> 01:00:11,244
Really? I call mine
"Thor's Hammer."

896
01:00:14,045 --> 01:00:15,845
I can't see shit.

897
01:00:16,844 --> 01:00:19,345
Bottom line is,
parodies come from the truth.

898
01:00:19,345 --> 01:00:20,446
It's observ ation.

899
01:00:20,446 --> 01:00:23,146
So if something
looks familiar, heads up.

900
01:00:46,751 --> 01:00:48,751
Ha-ha, Boner.

901
01:00:51,952 --> 01:00:53,053
Boner?

902
01:01:01,554 --> 01:01:03,055
Stay back, asshole !

903
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,580
Damn these fake tits.

904
01:03:19,183 --> 01:03:21,984
This surveillance work
is really interesting.

905
01:03:22,084 --> 01:03:23,385
Yeah.

906
01:03:23,485 --> 01:03:26,384
It must be really hard trying to
be so inconspicuous and quiet.

907
01:03:26,384 --> 01:03:28,785
Right, well not everybody
is cut out for it, you know.

908
01:03:28,785 --> 01:03:30,786
Hey, have you ever heard
me play the drums?

909
01:04:33,899 --> 01:04:36,399
Damn !

910
01:04:49,102 --> 01:04:51,003
Hey, not bad.

911
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:54,001
Here it comes.

912
01:04:54,001 --> 01:04:55,901
"And don't call me Shirley! "

913
01:04:57,302 --> 01:04:58,702
Hey, hey guys.

914
01:04:58,702 --> 01:05:00,903
They just found the
Administrator Formerly

915
01:05:00,903 --> 01:05:03,704
Known as Principal,
bound and gagged, dead.

916
01:05:04,504 --> 01:05:06,105
Let's go down there before
the coroner does...

917
01:05:06,105 --> 01:05:07,805
and play "Weekend at Bernie's"
with him.

918
01:05:11,606 --> 01:05:13,507
And I never got
a chance to know him.

919
01:05:13,507 --> 01:05:16,208
I'll get it.
It could be my accountant.

920
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:25,911
So, here we are all alone.

921
01:05:27,211 --> 01:05:28,812
Right?

922
01:05:29,712 --> 01:05:31,512
I have something for you,
Dawson.

923
01:05:32,513 --> 01:05:33,513
Oh, yeah?

924
01:05:35,214 --> 01:05:37,314
I want you, Dawson.

925
01:05:38,115 --> 01:05:39,815
You want me to wear that?

926
01:05:39,815 --> 01:05:41,916
No, this is for me.

927
01:05:41,916 --> 01:05:45,118
But this is for you.

928
01:05:46,518 --> 01:05:49,819
Oh.

929
01:05:49,919 --> 01:05:51,320
Wait, wait.
Wait a se cond.

930
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,221
I thought you were a lesbian !

931
01:05:55,221 --> 01:05:58,522
A lesbian?
Why?

932
01:05:58,522 --> 01:06:00,022
Hello?

933
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,923
You play softball.
You watch Ally McBeal.

934
01:06:04,724 --> 01:06:06,424
The WN BA?

935
01:06:06,824 --> 01:06:10,626
No Dawson, I'm not gay.
Barbara's gay.

936
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:13,727
Barbara?

937
01:06:13,727 --> 01:06:15,927
Big Rosie fan.

938
01:06:18,228 --> 01:06:20,329
- But, you are a witch, right?
- Oh, yeah.

939
01:06:28,231 --> 01:06:31,032
Lame Gag !
You s cared the crap out of us.

940
01:06:31,132 --> 01:06:34,333
What is it, boy?

941
01:06:34,333 --> 01:06:37,234
I'm sorry.
What is it, girl?

942
01:06:38,734 --> 01:06:40,435
Slab's in trouble?

943
01:06:40,435 --> 01:06:43,436
Steroids?
In the bathroom?

944
01:06:43,436 --> 01:06:45,637
Burt Reynolds wears a rug?

945
01:06:45,637 --> 01:06:48,738
O.J. was framed?

946
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:50,438
Khaki's aren't cool?

947
01:06:50,438 --> 01:06:52,839
I have to disagree with you.
I think you're completely...

948
01:06:52,839 --> 01:06:54,339
Well, fuck you too!

949
01:06:54,339 --> 01:06:55,740
Come on, let's go.

950
01:07:00,441 --> 01:07:02,442
- Slab!
- Oh my gosh !

951
01:07:06,543 --> 01:07:08,444
I think I used too much.

952
01:07:34,853 --> 01:07:36,753
Oh, this is horrible.

953
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:41,155
I know.
Who is gonna clean this up?

954
01:07:45,356 --> 01:07:48,757
Dawson, no.

955
01:07:48,857 --> 01:07:50,858
There's no point
in beating Dead Horse.

956
01:08:00,861 --> 01:08:05,362
Okay, Dawson, I'm going to ...

957
01:08:05,462 --> 01:08:08,463
Dawson, Dawson !

958
01:08:08,463 --> 01:08:10,564
I was just che cking for clues.

959
01:08:10,664 --> 01:08:12,365
Would you?

960
01:08:21,868 --> 01:08:23,268
Mmmmm, beefy!

961
01:08:27,669 --> 01:08:29,670
You're too late.

962
01:10:57,218 --> 01:10:58,018
Alright.

963
01:11:01,419 --> 01:11:03,520
Alright, pepperoni boy,
let's see 'em.

964
01:11:13,923 --> 01:11:15,724
We made it!

965
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,501
Hold on,
I'll take care of this.

966
01:11:30,901 --> 01:11:34,202
You mean big bully!
You bad, bad, bad killer.

967
01:11:34,302 --> 01:11:36,704
I'm going to s cratch
your eyes out, big bully.

968
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:42,806
Whoa !

969
01:12:02,813 --> 01:12:05,614
Alright!
Yeah, kick his ass !

970
01:12:10,217 --> 01:12:13,018
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

971
01:12:18,819 --> 01:12:21,820
You sure you're not a lesbian?

972
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:23,721
Well, once, at camp.

973
01:12:23,721 --> 01:12:25,121
Cool.

974
01:12:25,822 --> 01:12:28,123
Let's find out
who this asshole is.

975
01:12:40,127 --> 01:12:41,627
Who is that?

976
01:12:41,627 --> 01:12:43,028
Abe Lincoln.

977
01:12:43,028 --> 01:12:44,129
Abe?

978
01:12:50,631 --> 01:12:51,932
Okay, come on now.
Take them off.

979
01:12:51,932 --> 01:12:54,332
But, they're company property.

980
01:13:03,436 --> 01:13:04,937
N ice.

981
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:17,141
Sh-hh.
Did you hear that?

982
01:13:17,242 --> 01:13:19,042
- Oh, excuse me.
- No, not that.

983
01:13:22,343 --> 01:13:23,343
Let's roll.

984
01:13:35,048 --> 01:13:38,149
Hey, wide load, you and pizza dork
gotta hoof it.

985
01:13:38,549 --> 01:13:39,549
Get off!

986
01:13:43,351 --> 01:13:44,151
We're going in !

987
01:13:46,352 --> 01:13:47,252
Come on.

988
01:13:58,456 --> 01:14:00,557
Hey, I think this
is the last one.

989
01:14:04,258 --> 01:14:05,359
You !

990
01:14:06,059 --> 01:14:07,960
Who were you expe cting,
Billy Loomis' mother?

991
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,361
Of course !
Rule N umber 1 0 1 :

992
01:14:10,461 --> 01:14:12,362
You can't have
a successful parody

993
01:14:12,462 --> 01:14:15,963
without mocking, contrived,
confusing endings.

994
01:14:15,963 --> 01:14:18,464
But why, Doughy?

995
01:14:18,464 --> 01:14:21,064
I'm not Doughy, dumbass.

996
01:14:21,064 --> 01:14:22,665
That's not even real.

997
01:14:22,665 --> 01:14:24,066
But it is dastardly.

998
01:14:24,066 --> 01:14:28,568
So if you're not Doughy,
that makes you...

999
01:14:28,568 --> 01:14:29,668
Yes !

1000
01:14:29,768 --> 01:14:32,269
Doughy's evil twin cousin,
Harding !

1001
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:35,970
Wow, good twist.

1002
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:39,171
So what's your motive?

1003
01:14:39,171 --> 01:14:42,173
In the Millennium--
motives are accidental.

1004
01:14:42,273 --> 01:14:43,874
Do you mean "incidental"?

1005
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,100
I should have killed you first.

1006
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,201
Hey. Hey! Now--

1007
01:14:48,301 --> 01:14:51,702
I suppose this is what you
used to disguise your voice.

1008
01:14:51,802 --> 01:14:53,603
Helloooo, Cindy!

1009
01:14:54,403 --> 01:14:56,203
No, I mean this !

1010
01:15:00,405 --> 01:15:02,405
Hello, Martina.

1011
01:15:02,405 --> 01:15:04,206
What's your favorite movie?

1012
01:15:04,306 --> 01:15:07,007
I am your father, Luke.

1013
01:15:07,907 --> 01:15:08,707
Freeze !

1014
01:15:09,507 --> 01:15:10,508
Don't shoot, I give up.

1015
01:15:12,607 --> 01:15:14,608
- Hardy!
- Yo, Dough !

1016
01:15:15,808 --> 01:15:18,009
Doughy, what's going on?

1017
01:15:18,009 --> 01:15:19,310
They're identical.

1018
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:21,810
Yeah, one good,
one evil.

1019
01:15:21,810 --> 01:15:24,411
Wow, just like the Olsons.

1020
01:15:25,011 --> 01:15:27,012
Except where as Harding
enjoys a minuet,

1021
01:15:27,012 --> 01:15:29,513
ballet russes
and crepe suzette...

1022
01:15:29,613 --> 01:15:31,013
Doughy likes to rock and roll,

1023
01:15:31,013 --> 01:15:32,414
a hot dog makes
him lose control.

1024
01:15:32,414 --> 01:15:33,714
What a wild duet.

1025
01:15:33,814 --> 01:15:35,214
Still, they're cousins.

1026
01:15:35,214 --> 01:15:36,315
Identical cousins.

1027
01:15:36,415 --> 01:15:37,115
They laugh alike.

1028
01:15:37,215 --> 01:15:38,115
They walk alike.

1029
01:15:38,215 --> 01:15:39,216
At times
they even talk alike.

1030
01:15:39,216 --> 01:15:40,216
And, you can lose your mind.

1031
01:15:40,316 --> 01:15:42,317
Shut up everybody!
For God's sakes,

1032
01:15:42,417 --> 01:15:45,118
how many times do you think
we've heard that in our lives?

1033
01:15:45,118 --> 01:15:46,018
A little respe ct!

1034
01:15:46,118 --> 01:15:47,418
Harding !

1035
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:50,219
You're a disgrace and an
embarrassment to our family!

1036
01:15:50,219 --> 01:15:52,720
Be cause of the stain
on grandma's dress?

1037
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,020
No...

1038
01:15:56,921 --> 01:15:59,222
Oh, that.
Yeah.

1039
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:03,123
Listen, I'm really sorry.

1040
01:16:03,123 --> 01:16:05,124
Is there any way I can
make it up to you, Doughy?

1041
01:16:05,124 --> 01:16:06,024
Well, first of all,

1042
01:16:06,024 --> 01:16:07,725
you can take that costume back

1043
01:16:07,725 --> 01:16:09,824
to its rightful owners
at the mall.

1044
01:16:09,924 --> 01:16:12,425
I don't have the re ceipt.

1045
01:16:12,525 --> 01:16:13,625
I'll make some calls.

1046
01:16:13,725 --> 01:16:15,826
But don't forget
about the fake dogshit.

1047
01:16:17,227 --> 01:16:18,927
I didn't take any dogshit.

1048
01:16:34,732 --> 01:16:36,433
Alright, you knucklehead,
give me a hug.

1049
01:16:39,934 --> 01:16:41,734
Ow.

1050
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,500
N ice shot!

1051
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:47,100
H uh?

1052
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:52,099
Oops.

1053
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:56,000
You guys all saw that--
I mean, that was an accident.

1054
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:57,700
Yeah, it happens.

1055
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,600
I really need
to get a new shade.

1056
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,000
Here, try mine.

1057
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:05,900
Perfe ct.

1058
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,700
Well, I've got my s coop.
See ya, Doughy.

1059
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:10,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.

1060
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:12,000
What about dinner
at the Wiener Puff?

1061
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:14,400
Or maybe a snack
at the Pretzel Shack?

1062
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,200
- Did you bring your bike?
- Uh-huh.

1063
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,700
What about us?

1064
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,799
Pizza guys get all the pussy.

1065
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,700
Don't worry, Doughy,

1066
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:36,200
we've got it all under control.

1067
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,300
Yeah, except for
all those dead people.

1068
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:41,900
Yeah. Well.

1069
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,100
Let's go, kids.

1070
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:49,000
Alright guys--

1071
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
bag 'em, tag 'em,
let's wrap this up.

1072
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:52,400
We'll take it from here.

1073
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,600
Wow, Doughy.
A twin cousin.

1074
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,700
Yeah, the resemblance
was remarkable.

1075
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:11,500
People say we look
like Tom Cruise.

1076
01:18:12,399 --> 01:18:13,200
Hey, catering.

1077
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,700
Martina.
Dawson.

1078
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:24,700
Boner, you're alive.

1079
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,700
God bless Viagra !

1080
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,599
It saved my life.

1081
01:18:28,599 --> 01:18:30,200
I ate a whole bottle...

1082
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:33,500
And when I had my heart attack,
the blood kept pumping anyway.

1083
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,800
I can take this from here.

1084
01:18:41,299 --> 01:18:42,200
Yes !

1085
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:52,100
We are so lucky
to have survived.

1086
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:54,600
Now we can be together forever.

1087
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:57,000
Well, at least until the sequel.

1088
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,700
The End... as if.

1089
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:02,200
Aren't you gay?

1090
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,200
Not on my watch, punk.

1091
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:26,700
Well, I guess
that about does it.

1092
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:28,000
I killed my cousin.

1093
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,300
My heart's broken
and my sister's dead.

1094
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,400
Dammit, I love this job.

1095
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:38,100
Well, now we're safe,
thank God.

1096
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:43,000
Hey, you want to go for a walk
in the dark, s cary woods?

1097
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,600
Sure.

1098
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:56,600
Hey, Dawson !

1099
01:19:56,700 --> 01:20:00,200
Everybody! I did it!
I'm not a virgin anymore !

1100
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,600
- Hello, Sydney.
- What?

1101
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:13,100
I'm sorry-- I'm losing you.

1102
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,200
I said-- hello, Sydney.

1103
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:17,800
You're breaking up--
hello?

1104
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:19,800
Who was it?

1105
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:22,200
I don't know,
but if it's important,

1106
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:23,900
they'll call back.

1107
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,100
Damned cell phones.
