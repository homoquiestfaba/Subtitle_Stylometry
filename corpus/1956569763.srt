1
00:00:01,017 --> 00:00:04,100
(film reel clicking)

2
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:09,586
(rock music)

3
00:02:05,782 --> 00:02:07,032
- [Clinton] Hi.

4
00:02:10,903 --> 00:02:12,129
- Hi.

5
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:13,705
- Can I, can I sit down?

6
00:02:13,705 --> 00:02:15,556
Or are you, are you waiting for someone?

7
00:02:15,556 --> 00:02:19,056
- No, yes, no, I'm not waiting for anyone.

8
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,492
Yeah, you can sit down.

9
00:02:36,996 --> 00:02:38,329
- Oh hey, sorry.

10
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,813
Clinton.

11
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,273
- I'm Casey.

12
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,623
I saw you staring at me.

13
00:02:51,737 --> 00:02:53,100
- Oh, yeah.

14
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,923
Uh, sorry, it's just um,

15
00:02:55,971 --> 00:03:00,971
you seem sort of out of
place here, you know?

16
00:03:02,368 --> 00:03:03,201
- Okay.

17
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:04,453
- No, I mean, I'm serious.

18
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,393
Why are you here by yourself?

19
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,400
- Just came here to have a drink.

20
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,993
- There are a million places
in the city to have a drink.

21
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,100
And no one even comes here,

22
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,650
I can't believe you even found it.

23
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,250
This would be my last choice if you know,

24
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,163
I was a pretty girl.

25
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,710
- Well what are you doing here?

26
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:34,477
(soft rock music)

27
00:03:36,151 --> 00:03:37,630
- Don't know.

28
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,480
- I like it here.

29
00:03:40,356 --> 00:03:41,967
I like the people.

30
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:43,033
- Are you serious?

31
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,190
There's got to be better people in any bar

32
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,620
in the entire world.

33
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,510
- Better?

34
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,343
- Well.

35
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,173
Classier.

36
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,340
- Trust me, I've been
to more than my share

37
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,533
of those places, okay?

38
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,810
When you go to those
places you aren't meeting

39
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,795
people at their truest state.

40
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:05,730
- Why would you wanna do that?

41
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,192
- They've got on their
favorite designer jeans and

42
00:04:10,192 --> 00:04:13,188
drench themselves in their
smelliest cologne and

43
00:04:13,188 --> 00:04:15,938
draw on their fakest smile and...

44
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:19,770
You can't even have a
conversation with those people

45
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:23,687
because as soon you're
looking in the mirror...

46
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,130
- I don't know if I buy it.

47
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,126
- Okay?

48
00:04:32,126 --> 00:04:32,959
Um...

49
00:04:37,085 --> 00:04:38,585
So what do you do?

50
00:04:42,868 --> 00:04:43,868
- I'm a spy.

51
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,929
- Okay, look.

52
00:04:47,929 --> 00:04:51,189
- Shh.

53
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:53,470
- You don't have to tell me, it's fine.

54
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,717
But, how am I supposed to get to know you?

55
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,583
- Why would you wanna do that?

56
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,953
- You seem interesting.

57
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
- All right, well, I was born in Hawaii

58
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,880
on a um, on a pineapple farm

59
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,600
where I spent most of my
earlier years you know,

60
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,673
running wild with the
natives in the rainforests.

61
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,070
I went off to college.

62
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,253
- So what'd you study?

63
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,300
- Uh, law.

64
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,937
And, uh, and medicine, so.

65
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,910
- So that way in case any
of your patients ever filed

66
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,328
a lawsuit, then you'd be covered because--

67
00:05:41,328 --> 00:05:42,161
- Yep.

68
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,510
- Right.

69
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,187
- So, uh, do you feel
like you know me now?

70
00:05:50,108 --> 00:05:51,210
- Yeah.

71
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,803
- Yeah, well, what were you
gonna do once you left here?

72
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,590
- I was probably uh, just gonna go home.

73
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,750
- Oh well, you know maybe
I could get your number

74
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,473
so I could call you.

75
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,840
- You know, I was just
gonna go watch a movie.

76
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,630
Maybe you'd like to come?

77
00:06:15,464 --> 00:06:17,850
- Oh, uh, I don't know.

78
00:06:19,993 --> 00:06:21,193
What movie is it?

79
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,333
- Why?

80
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,856
- Well because, you know,
I don't know if I wanna go

81
00:06:25,856 --> 00:06:28,583
if it's a movie I've seen already.

82
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,957
- We'll make sure it's
something new for both of us.

83
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,113
- Okay.

84
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:41,072
I think I can do that.

85
00:06:43,512 --> 00:06:44,595
- Okay, good.

86
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,017
(slow, strange music)

87
00:08:04,231 --> 00:08:05,064
Uh uh.

88
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,874
Take off your clothes.

89
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:12,454
(slow, strange music)

90
00:08:45,197 --> 00:08:48,197
(soft, eerie music)

91
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,971
(door closes)

92
00:09:49,971 --> 00:09:53,033
(door unlocks)

93
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:55,200
(exhales)

94
00:09:57,753 --> 00:10:00,253
(door closes)

95
00:10:41,356 --> 00:10:44,023
(phone ringing)

96
00:10:55,053 --> 00:10:56,471
- Wrong number.

97
00:10:56,471 --> 00:10:57,971
- [Casey] Clinton?

98
00:10:59,188 --> 00:11:00,686
- Who is this?

99
00:11:00,686 --> 00:11:01,704
- [Casey] It's me.

100
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:02,537
Casey.

101
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:03,370
We met last night.

102
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:07,019
Do you remember me?

103
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,213
- Uh yeah, of course.

104
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,370
How did you get my number?

105
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,150
- [Casey] Quit joking.

106
00:11:16,861 --> 00:11:18,167
Are you serious?

107
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:19,697
You wrote it on that piece
of paper that you left

108
00:11:19,697 --> 00:11:21,303
on top of my dresser.

109
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,400
Did I wake you up?

110
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,233
- Yeah.

111
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:28,980
- [Casey] I'm sorry.

112
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,243
I just wanted to say I'd really love

113
00:11:31,243 --> 00:11:33,071
to see you again tonight.

114
00:11:33,071 --> 00:11:34,774
- You what?

115
00:11:34,774 --> 00:11:37,505
- [Casey] I'd like to
see you again tonight.

116
00:11:37,505 --> 00:11:39,270
I mean, unless you're too busy spying.

117
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,103
- No.

118
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,230
- [Casey] Great.

119
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,040
Then I'll come by after work.

120
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,554
I don't know, maybe around seven?

121
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:46,511
- What, no?

122
00:11:46,511 --> 00:11:47,344
- [Casey] I'll be right there.

123
00:11:47,344 --> 00:11:48,440
Clinton, I'm so sorry, I've got to run.

124
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,890
But I'll see you tonight okay?

125
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,307
(call drops)

126
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,510
(slow, eerie music)

127
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,652
- What?

128
00:12:27,773 --> 00:12:30,523
(birds chirping)

129
00:12:36,195 --> 00:12:38,945
(chain rattling)

130
00:12:52,461 --> 00:12:55,378
(electronic music)

131
00:13:35,902 --> 00:13:37,370
(chuckles)

132
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,677
- Oh, you like her.

133
00:13:41,185 --> 00:13:42,485
Met her at the mall today.

134
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,340
She asked me if I knew
any good spots around

135
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,253
here to go party.

136
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,360
I told her, "Sweetheart.

137
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:52,680
"God must be looking out for you

138
00:13:54,478 --> 00:13:55,847
"'cause I know just the place."

139
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,677
(phone ringing)

140
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,560
- Hello?

141
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,460
- [Shane] Clint, you son of a bitch.

142
00:14:17,745 --> 00:14:18,930
- Shane.

143
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,873
- [Shane] Who else would
be calling you asshole?

144
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,000
- Hey, are you, are you out?

145
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,890
I mean, when did you get out?

146
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:26,920
- [Shane] This morning.

147
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,721
- Where are you staying?

148
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:30,824
- [Shane] Eh, you know, at my mom's house.

149
00:14:30,824 --> 00:14:32,040
You still at that same shithole?

150
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,813
- Uh yeah.

151
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,883
Yeah.

152
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,530
It's good to hear from you Shane.

153
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:40,500
- [Shane] A whole fucking year man.

154
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,333
- Yeah, fuck.

155
00:14:42,824 --> 00:14:45,497
- [Shane] So how come
you stopped visiting me?

156
00:14:45,497 --> 00:14:48,289
- Hey, I'm sorry, I
wanted to it's just, uh--

157
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:49,122
- [Shane] Yeah, yeah I understand, man.

158
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:50,510
You're a fuckin' asshole.

159
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,490
Listen, I gotta talk
to you about something.

160
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,290
I'm coming by tomorrow.

161
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,180
- What?

162
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,980
- [Shane] I'll talk to
you about it tomorrow.

163
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,688
- Yeah, just come by.

164
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,105
(call drops)

165
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:15,831
(knocking)

166
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,090
(knocking)

167
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:39,980
- Hi.

168
00:15:42,884 --> 00:15:44,640
(chuckles)

169
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,783
I like your place.

170
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,343
It's cute.

171
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,883
- Hey, uh, how did you get my address?

172
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,453
- How drunk were you last night?

173
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,873
You wrote it next to your phone number.

174
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,000
You left it by my dresser.

175
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,128
- I did?

176
00:16:07,128 --> 00:16:07,961
- Mhm.

177
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,810
You know, it was really
nice of you to do that.

178
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,390
Most guys would have
left without leaving me

179
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,023
any way to get in touch with them.

180
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,763
Sort of like a um, one night stand.

181
00:16:22,706 --> 00:16:23,539
You know?

182
00:16:26,114 --> 00:16:26,947
- Wait.

183
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:31,339
(slow, eerie music)

184
00:16:51,162 --> 00:16:53,245
(groans)

185
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:04,691
(birds chirping)

186
00:17:24,975 --> 00:17:27,308
(rummaging)

187
00:17:30,188 --> 00:17:31,021
Shit.

188
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:48,605
(rummaging)

189
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:01,534
(beeping)

190
00:18:04,796 --> 00:18:07,099
(dialing)

191
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:08,020
- [Casey] This is Casey Green.

192
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,590
- Yeah, it's Clinton.

193
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,520
- [Casey] Hey you.

194
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,034
Good morning.

195
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:12,950
Did you get any sleep?

196
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,116
- Hey, what'd you do to my apartment?

197
00:18:15,116 --> 00:18:16,540
- [Casey] What did I do to your apartment?

198
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,090
- Look, I don't care if
you cleaned up the place,

199
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,610
but you threw away things
that were important.

200
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,990
- [Casey] What things?

201
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,910
I don't understand.

202
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,976
- What, you don't understand?

203
00:18:24,976 --> 00:18:25,809
What don't you understand?

204
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:27,150
- [Casey] Hang on.

205
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,680
- [Man] Faster Fixer.

206
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,683
You don't need lots of
money to take legal action.

207
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,520
- [Casey] Hi, so uh, what were you saying?

208
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,780
- Look, don't throw away my shit.

209
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,190
- [Casey] Clinton, I am so sorry.

210
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,560
I'm really busy, but
listen, I didn't do anything

211
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,968
to your apartment.

212
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:44,068
(call drops)
- Hello?

213
00:18:57,542 --> 00:19:00,292
(static buzzing)

214
00:19:05,586 --> 00:19:07,836
(knocking)

215
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,608
(slaps)

216
00:19:18,608 --> 00:19:20,591
(chuckles)

217
00:19:20,591 --> 00:19:23,091
- What the hell happened here?

218
00:19:25,357 --> 00:19:26,190
At least you got something right.

219
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,450
I thought I wandered
into another dimension

220
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,150
where you weren't a fuckin' loser.

221
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,326
Give me a light.

222
00:19:31,326 --> 00:19:34,076
(lighter clicks)

223
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,350
Still cop from Bert?

224
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,183
- Yeah.

225
00:19:37,183 --> 00:19:38,503
- How is that fuckin' dumb ass?

226
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,423
- Still a fuckin' dumb ass.

227
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,220
- What is this shit?

228
00:19:45,243 --> 00:19:46,500
- It's shit.

229
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,943
- Yeah it is, I can't
believe Bert sells this shit.

230
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,315
- So how was it--

231
00:19:52,315 --> 00:19:53,450
- I could sit here all day,
asking you how you've been

232
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,820
and shit, but we both know
I don't give a fuck, so,

233
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,270
let me tell you why I'm here.

234
00:19:58,235 --> 00:19:59,640
All right, I aint got dick.

235
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,910
I'm sleeping on Morello's couch.

236
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,530
I got maybe 20 bucks to my name.

237
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,988
We both know I'm not the working type.

238
00:20:04,988 --> 00:20:05,821
You know the electronics store down on

239
00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:06,654
Third and Gardener?

240
00:20:06,654 --> 00:20:07,487
Goods?

241
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,020
- Yeah.

242
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,853
What about it?

243
00:20:10,853 --> 00:20:13,000
- You know that that Goods is one of 228

244
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,030
Goods Electronic stores
across the country?

245
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:15,863
- No.

246
00:20:15,863 --> 00:20:17,450
- Albert Good.

247
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,900
Albert Good owns them all.

248
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,200
He's richer than God.

249
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,510
He's got a house in Encino.

250
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,220
Now Jackson told me--
- Jackson?

251
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,053
- Let me finish.

252
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,463
Jackson's cousin works
for Goods, all right?

253
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,120
Anyway last year apparently
the main man himself

254
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,200
had a party, a big ass party.

255
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,590
The party's fucking
unreal from what I hear,

256
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:36,470
fuckin' chicks snorting coke
off each other's tits and shit.

257
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,650
More important than that, this house,

258
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,850
it's a fuckin' palace.

259
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,750
Jackson's brother said
that this place got like

260
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,330
five million dollars worth of shit in it.

261
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,430
Fuckin', fuckin' paintings, you know,

262
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,120
rare art pieces or some shit.

263
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,240
He also said, fucking get this,

264
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,620
there's a tree, right?

265
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,620
Right in the middle of the main hall,

266
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,620
stands over 20 feet tall, but the leaves.

267
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,570
They're not leaves.

268
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,243
Guess what they fuckin' are?

269
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,920
- I don't know.

270
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,630
- Fuckin' hundred dollar bills.

271
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,930
Fuckin' hundred dollar bills folded up

272
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,543
to look like leaves. (laughs)

273
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,690
- Wow, so, uh, why are
you telling me all this?

274
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,460
- 'Cause Jackson's been
doing a lot of research,

275
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,750
I think he sucked somebody off and he got

276
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,800
plans to the guy's house.

277
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,560
He got the guy's schedule
down, and he's been spending

278
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,210
a lot of time in the Valley
scoping this guy out.

279
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,043
- That's great.

280
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,890
- He wants to rob him, Clinton.

281
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,010
- That's great, Shane,
that's really great.

282
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,223
Hey, you know good for Jackson.

283
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,330
- No, not good for Jackson.

284
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,283
Good for us.

285
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,750
- What is that supposed to mean?

286
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,420
- I was locked up with one of
Jackson's friends, all right?

287
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,457
He told me about the plan he said,

288
00:21:39,457 --> 00:21:40,987
"When you get out, give Jackson a call,

289
00:21:40,987 --> 00:21:42,718
"maybe he'll let you in on it."

290
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,843
- Come on, don't tell
me you actually did it.

291
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,783
What are you man?

292
00:21:48,657 --> 00:21:49,490
I mean are you a criminal now?

293
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,000
Are you a thief?

294
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,950
Are you nuts, man?

295
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,190
I know you Shane, this aint you.

296
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,303
- You don't know shit.

297
00:21:57,866 --> 00:22:01,493
- What, so, you actually
talked to Jackson Stokes?

298
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,286
- I know. (laughs)

299
00:22:06,286 --> 00:22:07,160
You remember how we used to talk about him

300
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,993
when we were kids?

301
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,740
- Yeah, we used to talk
about how crazy he was.

302
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,100
- Maybe.

303
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,860
But from what I hear,
Jackson has a fool proof plan

304
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,693
to rob this guy.

305
00:22:14,693 --> 00:22:16,330
I mean the guy is going
to like Fiji or something

306
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,163
for a month.

307
00:22:17,163 --> 00:22:19,460
The point is, he wants to do it, Clint.

308
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,343
- You wanna get locked up again, man?

309
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,940
- Dude, we're not fucking
going in there guns blazing

310
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,749
or shit, I mean, it's like fuckin',

311
00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:28,582
you know what it's like?

312
00:22:28,582 --> 00:22:30,340
It's like that fuckin' time
we robbed Jimmy Latola's house

313
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,430
for an ounce.

314
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:35,440
- Uh, only when you steal
weed, no one calls the cops.

315
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,840
- Same fuckin' thing, Clint.

316
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:42,542
- So have you actually, you know, met him?

317
00:22:42,542 --> 00:22:43,375
- What, Jackson?

318
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:44,208
Yeah.

319
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,740
And you will too, this Saturday.

320
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,047
- No.

321
00:22:47,047 --> 00:22:47,880
Not me.

322
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,713
- [Shane] Wait.

323
00:22:48,713 --> 00:22:49,546
- Fuck that.

324
00:22:49,546 --> 00:22:50,379
- No, fuck you.

325
00:22:50,379 --> 00:22:51,800
Listen to me, you said
I have to bring somebody

326
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,793
or the deal's off.

327
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,070
Dude, you don't have to do anything

328
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,085
and I asked the guy what you had to do,

329
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:57,918
and you have to fucking
stand there and make sure

330
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,863
the rent-a-cop doesn't show up, that's it.

331
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,330
- I'm not doing it, man.

332
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:07,083
- All you have to do is
fuckin' stand there, asshole.

333
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,770
Dude, dude.

334
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:11,603
Dude.

335
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:14,420
The guy guaranteed us $10,000 apiece.

336
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,210
Now you cannot tell me
you don't need that.

337
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,320
- Yeah.

338
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,580
I do.

339
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,450
But this is nuts, that you
just got out of prison.

340
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,440
You wanna go right back?

341
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,680
- Dude, that was fuckin' bullshit

342
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,513
and you fuckin' know it.

343
00:23:25,513 --> 00:23:27,070
I had one less ounce, it's possession,

344
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,523
it's a fuckin' fluke, man.

345
00:23:29,926 --> 00:23:30,759
(Clinton sighs)

346
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:31,592
How about this?

347
00:23:31,592 --> 00:23:33,990
You're fuckin' doin' it,
and that's fuckin' final.

348
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,213
I'll pick you up this Saturday,
we're going to see him.

349
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,163
How long have we known each other man?

350
00:23:46,121 --> 00:23:46,954
- A long time.

351
00:23:46,954 --> 00:23:47,863
- A long fuckin' time.

352
00:23:49,674 --> 00:23:50,713
Now you remember that.

353
00:23:51,965 --> 00:23:54,548
You're like my fuckin' brother.

354
00:23:59,353 --> 00:24:01,353
(sighs)

355
00:24:09,456 --> 00:24:12,373

(groans)

376
00:26:51,745 --> 00:26:56,745
- Ah.
(phone ringing)

377
00:27:03,277 --> 00:27:04,441
Hello?

378
00:27:04,441 --> 00:27:06,853
- [Shane] Hey, Clint?

379
00:27:06,853 --> 00:27:08,240
- Yeah?

380
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,721
- [Shane] What the fuck man?

381
00:27:09,721 --> 00:27:11,028
- What?

382
00:27:11,028 --> 00:27:12,074
- [Shane] What do you mean what?

383
00:27:12,074 --> 00:27:14,151
You know he's in the fuckin' hospital?

384
00:27:14,151 --> 00:27:14,984
- Who?

385
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,090
- [Shane] Who do you think?

386
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:24,973
- So we get back there,
and she wants to party.

387
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:30,030
The only thing is this type of party

388
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,673
requires monetary expenditure.

389
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,813
Well the only problem is,
she aint got no money.

390
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,113
As it turns out,

391
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,963
that wasn't a problem at all.

392
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,293
She told me she was 23.

393
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,920
Ah.

394
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,170
But I checked her wallet.

395
00:28:04,171 --> 00:28:05,004
She's 16.

396
00:28:06,003 --> 00:28:09,420
(muted electronic music)

397
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,080
You like her don't you?

398
00:28:17,384 --> 00:28:21,301
You'd like to squeeze
into something like that.

399
00:28:23,073 --> 00:28:25,293
Feel them skinny little
legs wrapped around you.

400
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,553
I'm tellin' you, you aint
never had it like this.

401
00:28:32,914 --> 00:28:33,747
It was so nice.

402
00:28:37,077 --> 00:28:38,563
$20 and you can fuck her.

403
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,740
You can do anything you want.

404
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,766
You can put it wherever you want.

405
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:45,620
You can put it in her ear,

406
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,200
open her mouth up, and
shit down her throat.

407
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,170
She don't mind.

408
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,003
Hey.

409
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,933
Hey, bitch, wake the fuck up.

410
00:28:58,115 --> 00:29:01,030
(scoffs)

411
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,130
She don't give a shit.

412
00:29:03,678 --> 00:29:05,153
She can't feel a fuckin' thing.

413
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:10,363
(muted electronic music)

414
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:20,252
- No man, I don't know
any young chick, okay?

415
00:29:20,252 --> 00:29:21,852
Whoever she is, she's lying man.

416
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,534
- [Shane] Oh you're so full of shit, dude.

417
00:29:25,534 --> 00:29:29,162
You just told me yesterday
you're still coppin' from Bert.

418
00:29:29,162 --> 00:29:30,746
- Oh yeah.

419
00:29:30,746 --> 00:29:31,579
- [Shane] So what did you lie to me,

420
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:33,844
saying you weren't there last night?

421
00:29:33,844 --> 00:29:36,358
What, do you think you
can't trust me or somethin'?

422
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:37,360
- It wasn't me.

423
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,942
- [Shane] Whatever man.

424
00:29:38,942 --> 00:29:40,523
I'm down the street, I'm coming over.

425
00:29:46,498 --> 00:29:49,433
(water running)

426
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:50,266
- Ah.

427
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,833
(heavy breathing)

428
00:29:58,745 --> 00:30:01,745
(slow, eerie music)

429
00:30:16,343 --> 00:30:19,176
(heavy breathing)

430
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:50,220
(knocking)

431
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,050
- I can't believe you
did that shit to Bert.

432
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,680
He's a big fuckin' boy,
I thought you had to use

433
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,630
a bat or something.

434
00:30:57,038 --> 00:30:59,749
What, you're still not
gonna tell me what happened?

435
00:30:59,749 --> 00:31:01,233
- I don't know what happened, man.

436
00:31:02,566 --> 00:31:06,525
- God, you must've been so fuckin' high.

437
00:31:06,525 --> 00:31:08,608
(winces)

438
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,960
- What the hell are those?

439
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,800
- Those are guns, Clint.

440
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,316
- I already told you I wasn't
doing that shit with Jackson.

441
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:26,088
- And I told you you were.
(lighter clicks)

442
00:31:26,088 --> 00:31:28,630
- Well even if I decided I was,

443
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,700
why would I need a gun, huh?

444
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,990
Who am I gonna shoot?

445
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,980
- Nobody man, all right,
it's just in case.

446
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,280
Now which one do you want?

447
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:40,990
You get this one then.

448
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,780
Got anything for me to smoke?

449
00:31:56,827 --> 00:31:58,327
Dude, this fuckin' shit again?

450
00:32:00,411 --> 00:32:02,971
(lighter clicks)

451
00:32:02,971 --> 00:32:03,804
Mm.

452
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,080
Dude, what's going on with you?

453
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,130
- Look, I don't know.

454
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:15,174
- You know, to be honest
man, it doesn't seem like

455
00:32:15,174 --> 00:32:16,007
you know a hell of a lot.

456
00:32:16,007 --> 00:32:17,175
You don't know what
happened to Bert last night,

457
00:32:17,175 --> 00:32:18,008
you don't know what's going on with you,

458
00:32:18,008 --> 00:32:18,841
what the fuck is up?

459
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:24,930
Have you been laid lately?

460
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,280
- Look, I don't wanna talk about it.

461
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,280
- 'Cause she doesn't fuckin' exist, man.

462
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,300
Maybe you're losing your mind.

463
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,830
Maybe all these drugs got you fucked up.

464
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,850
Maybe you got some kind of memory loss.

465
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,310
You know, next week,
you're not gonna remember

466
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,706
what happened today.

467
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:38,539
Maybe in a month, you're
gonna have to start writing

468
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,773
shit on top of your cock to
make sure you don't forget it.

469
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,400
- Maybe.

470
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,700
- Well whatever the fuck's going on dude,

471
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,810
pull yourself together, all right?

472
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:48,610
It fuckin' pains me to see
you actin' like such a pussy.

473
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,050
And hide that fuckin' gun.

474
00:32:55,837 --> 00:33:00,754
(door opens)
(door closes)

475
00:33:04,856 --> 00:33:07,412
(winces)

476
00:33:07,412 --> 00:33:10,662
(slow, dramatic music)

477
00:34:02,848 --> 00:34:05,765
(slow, soft music)

478
00:34:43,474 --> 00:34:44,974
- Son of a bitch.

479
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,481
(groans)

480
00:35:12,496 --> 00:35:14,017
(dramatic music)

481
00:35:14,017 --> 00:35:14,850
Oh shit.

482
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:15,683
Shit.

483
00:35:16,759 --> 00:35:18,759
(gasps)

484
00:36:07,172 --> 00:36:09,255
(grunts)

485
00:36:10,605 --> 00:36:12,855
(knocking)

486
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,379
Who is it?

487
00:36:15,379 --> 00:36:16,212
- It's Casey.

488
00:36:26,845 --> 00:36:29,490
You know, you were supposed to call me.

489
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,590
- [Clinton] What?

490
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,640
- You didn't call me.

491
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,580
- Look, I don't, I don't
know what the hell you mean

492
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,873
but shit's been weird
with me lately anyway.

493
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,720
- How?

494
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,313
- I don't know, uh, I think
I might be losing my mind.

495
00:36:47,752 --> 00:36:48,863
- Okay.

496
00:36:51,469 --> 00:36:52,302
Do you wanna talk about it?

497
00:36:52,302 --> 00:36:53,135
- No.

498
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,893
- Why not?
- Look, I just don't.

499
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,867
- Well do you just not wanna
talk to me about it, because--

500
00:36:59,867 --> 00:37:00,840
- No, what?

501
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,120
- If you're not gonna talk to me about it,

502
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,250
who are you gonna--

503
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,840
Oh my god, what happened to your hands?

504
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,380
- Okay, stop.

505
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,213
Stop, all right?

506
00:37:07,213 --> 00:37:08,810
Don't worry about me.

507
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,720
- I am worried, okay?

508
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,320
I mean, you haven't even
called me and your hands--

509
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,620
- Hey, hey, hey, who the
fuck do you think I am?

510
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:19,380
You think I'm like some
sweet guy or something?

511
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,593
Coming by my place unannounced
like we're fucking dating?

512
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,113
Fuck, what the hell is your problem?

513
00:37:31,007 --> 00:37:32,160
- I don't get why you're being like this.

514
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,380
Um--
- Crazy.

515
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:35,670
- I've gotta get back to work.

516
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,570
I just stopped by to
say hi and you're right.

517
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,833
You're being really weird, um.

518
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,730
Look, I've got work off tomorrow so,

519
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,893
are you gonna be around?

520
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,410
(door closes)

521
00:37:59,037 --> 00:38:00,400
I don't get why being like
this, you're being really weird.

522
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,407
If you're not gonna talk to me about,

523
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:03,240
then who are you gonna--

524
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,067
Then I'll just leave you here.

525
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:07,817
(sirens blaring)

526
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,308
(laughs)

527
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:34,844
Ah.

528
00:38:36,695 --> 00:38:37,528
Ah, fuck.

529
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:39,691
Ow.

530
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:02,071
Fuck.

531
00:39:26,335 --> 00:39:29,002
(phone ringing)

532
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,600
Hello?

533
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,863
- [Shane] I'm down the street.

534
00:39:39,863 --> 00:39:42,280
(call drops)

535
00:39:43,388 --> 00:39:44,221
- Yeah.

536
00:39:51,703 --> 00:39:54,120
(tires skid)

537
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,700
- Now it's probably best you let me talk

538
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,533
at this thing, all right?

539
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,050
You've been fucking weird lately,

540
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,530
and I don't want Jackson
telling me to fuck off

541
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:08,000
on account of you, so
keep your mouth shut.

542
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,790
You understand?

543
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:11,623
- All right.

544
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,678
- Why are you being so quiet lately man?

545
00:40:18,678 --> 00:40:19,693
Are you hiding something from me?

546
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,103
- No.

547
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,770
- Oh.

548
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,150
Dude, I met that girl.

549
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:27,983
That girl that was over at Bert's place

550
00:40:27,983 --> 00:40:30,023
that you decided to try and kill him.

551
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,670
She was asking me all about you dude,

552
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,423
wanted to know where you lived and shit.

553
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,340
- Did you tell her?

554
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:38,753
- Nah.

555
00:40:38,753 --> 00:40:39,586
Nah, I think I should've
though, 'cause I mean

556
00:40:39,586 --> 00:40:41,655
she was like, and I asked
her why she wanted to know,

557
00:40:41,655 --> 00:40:44,305
and she said 'cause she
wanted to thank you. (laughs)

558
00:40:46,155 --> 00:40:47,270
Man I can't believe you
didn't try to fuck her.

559
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,537
She's a hot piece of ass.

560
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:53,049
- All right, I just want
you assholes to know

561
00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:54,840
this is no petty bullshit here.

562
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:59,150
It's a very large and very expensive house

563
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,803
with alarms and security.

564
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:06,940
So what I wanna know right
now is that each and every

565
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,083
one of you knows exactly what
you're gettin' into here.

566
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:13,036
Some of you I trust.

567
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,410
We've worked together before.

568
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,583
Some of you I'm still getting to know.

569
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,320
Maggot, I will tell you this,

570
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,010
there is no trial period here.

571
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,143
We are not dating.

572
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,710
You fuck this up and I
shoot you on the spot.

573
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,553
Now for those of you who
never learned how to count,

574
00:41:42,553 --> 00:41:44,780
there are five of us in this room.

575
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,083
Each of you will have
a very specific task,

576
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,830
therefor stupidity will
not be an acceptable excuse

577
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:52,663
for fuckin' up.

578
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,250
I will start with a very simple overview,

579
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:00,250
I realize I must proceed very simply.

580
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:04,363
Our operation will have three stages.

581
00:42:05,572 --> 00:42:09,072
(frenzied, strange music)

582
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:15,639
And there's good chance that
somebody is gonna get shot

583
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:17,430
and probably killed.

584
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:20,520
- You actually talked to Jackson Stokes?

585
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,050
I don't care if you cleaned up the place,

586
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:24,590
but you threw away things
that were important.

587
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:26,181
- [Casey] What are you talking about?

588
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:27,993
- Because she doesn't fucking exist, man.

589
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:30,690
Maybe you're losing your mind.

590
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:32,130
Maybe all these drugs got you fucked up.

591
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:34,205
Maybe you got some kind of memory loss.

592
00:42:34,205 --> 00:42:36,630
(knocking)

593
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,463
- Who is it?

594
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,033
- You got the stomach
for that, motherfucker?

595
00:42:42,364 --> 00:42:45,230
(slow, dramatic music)

596
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:48,480
- Why are you looking at me
like I'm the Anti-Christ?

597
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,300
What makes you any better than me?

598
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,180
You've heard about
things that I have done,

599
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,767
but am I any worse than you?

600
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,030
Who are you?

601
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:58,863
What?

602
00:42:58,863 --> 00:43:00,670
- What the fuck are you screaming about?

603
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,055
What's the matter with this guy?

604
00:43:02,055 --> 00:43:03,580
Is he hard of hearing or something?

605
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,630
- I mean no, he's not hard of, he's fine.

606
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,060
- I said, all you gotta
do is keep your eyes

607
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,160
open for a rent-a-cop.

608
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:18,563
That's it guys.

609
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,140
We got two weeks to prepare.

610
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:23,873
Oh and one more thing.

611
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,990
If I should hear even a whisper

612
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:28,960
that anything in this
room we talked about today

613
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,923
hits the street,

614
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,270
I will take it upon myself
to personally castrate

615
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,570
each and every one of you,

616
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,390
and hang your motherfuckerin' balls

617
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:39,927
from my rear view mirror.

618
00:43:43,095 --> 00:43:46,678
(dramatic synth pop music)

619
00:45:21,395 --> 00:45:23,478
(groans)

620
00:45:36,811 --> 00:45:37,728
- Oh, fuck.

621
00:45:54,428 --> 00:45:57,928
(muted electronic music)

622
00:46:00,571 --> 00:46:03,430
- I'm gonna go break you off a sack, man.

623
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,183
You just take your time, brother.

624
00:46:07,758 --> 00:46:11,175
(muted electronic music)

625
00:46:27,498 --> 00:46:30,831
(electronic rock music)

626
00:47:09,814 --> 00:47:12,064
(knocking)

627
00:47:22,535 --> 00:47:23,368
- Hi.

628
00:47:25,094 --> 00:47:28,094
(soft, eerie music)

629
00:47:37,269 --> 00:47:38,602
- You know, I...

630
00:47:40,735 --> 00:47:41,985
I think you should leave.

631
00:47:43,386 --> 00:47:44,772
- [Casey] Why?

632
00:47:44,772 --> 00:47:46,270
- Because I don't know why
you keep on coming here

633
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:47,683
in the first place.

634
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,220
- [Casey] 'Cause I want to.

635
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,870
- Why would a girl like
you keep coming to see

636
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,735
a guy like me?

637
00:47:55,735 --> 00:47:56,568
- [Casey] Because I like you.

638
00:47:56,568 --> 00:47:58,483
- Yeah, like flies like shit.

639
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:00,683
- [Casey] Stop beating yourself down.

640
00:48:00,683 --> 00:48:02,330
- Hey well that's what I am, all right?

641
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:04,013
I'm a piece of shit.

642
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:08,040
You know what, I thought I was
the one who was going crazy,

643
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,240
but in reality, you're
the actual one that's

644
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,623
going fucking nuts.

645
00:48:13,813 --> 00:48:15,352
- [Casey] I don't understand.

646
00:48:15,352 --> 00:48:16,185
- Oh you don't?

647
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:17,123
Uh, all right.

648
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,203
You know what I like most about you?

649
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:22,123
Your pussy.

650
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:24,790
That's all you are to me.

651
00:48:26,101 --> 00:48:27,990
You're not even a real person to me.

652
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:29,663
You're a fuckin' wet dream.

653
00:48:30,816 --> 00:48:33,280
You know what, I don't even
think you really exist.

654
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,530
When I fuck you, I'm fuckin' myself.

655
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:39,450
It's the best sex I've ever
had, and that proves to me

656
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:40,683
that I'm right.

657
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,690
But you think I'm something that I'm not

658
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:47,790
and it's annoying, so I'm
setting the record straight

659
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:48,623
right now.

660
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,670
I'm a disease.

661
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:53,320
I'm worse than fucking cancer.

662
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,970
At least cancer is honest.

663
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:57,707
It says, "Hey, here I am.

664
00:48:57,707 --> 00:48:59,537
"I'm gonna fuckin' kill you."

665
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:01,690
You know what I say?

666
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:03,230
I say nothing.

667
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:06,193
I just fuck you, and then I use you,

668
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:10,713
and then I slowly eat your fucking heart.

669
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:13,853
So if you wanna leave, then good.

670
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,473
Because I didn't want
you in the first place.

671
00:49:43,248 --> 00:49:45,748
(door closes)

672
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:00,912
(sighs)

673
00:50:07,172 --> 00:50:09,255
(scoffs)

674
00:50:22,727 --> 00:50:25,227
(door closes)

675
00:50:36,294 --> 00:50:38,961
(water running)

676
00:50:46,898 --> 00:50:49,565
(phone ringing)

677
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,500
Hello?

678
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,850
- [Rachel] Is this Clinton?

679
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:00,950
- Who is this?

680
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:02,540
- [Rachel] Rachel.

681
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:04,230
- Who the hell is Rachel?

682
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:06,083
- [Rachel] You don't remember me?

683
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:07,130
- No.

684
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:09,200
- [Rachel] I just wanted
to call and thank you.

685
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,804
- For what?

686
00:51:10,804 --> 00:51:12,260
- [Rachel] Your number wasn't
easy to track down, you know.

687
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,493
- Thank me for what, Rachel?

688
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,490
- [Rachel] For saving me from that place.

689
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:23,970
- I don't know what you're talking about.

690
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:25,600
- [Rachel] Yes, you do.

691
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,013
You rescued me from him.

692
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,420
He drugged me Clinton.

693
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,603
He drugged me and he raped me.

694
00:51:31,926 --> 00:51:33,173
- Who?

695
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,816
- [Rachel] Bert.

696
00:51:34,816 --> 00:51:36,502
- And why should I care?

697
00:51:36,502 --> 00:51:39,036
- [Rachel] Because you saved me.

698
00:51:39,036 --> 00:51:40,773
Who knows what else he
would have done to me.

699
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:44,563
He even stole my charm necklace
that I got from my mom.

700
00:51:46,959 --> 00:51:49,217
- I don't know what you're talking about.

701
00:51:49,217 --> 00:51:51,212
- [Rachel] Why are you saying this?

702
00:51:51,212 --> 00:51:53,400
You came in there, I heard a fight,

703
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,396
and then you picked me up and you carried

704
00:51:55,396 --> 00:51:57,740
me to the hospital.

705
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,640
You were talking to me the whole time.

706
00:52:01,072 --> 00:52:03,020
Don't you remember, Clinton?

707
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,698
- You got the wrong number.

708
00:52:04,698 --> 00:52:05,531
- [Rachel] No.

709
00:52:05,531 --> 00:52:06,364
No, I remember.

710
00:52:06,364 --> 00:52:07,740
- Listen, it wasn't me.

711
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:10,740
I don't know what's going
on, but don't call me again.

712
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,040
Okay, I don't know you and I don't know

713
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,010
how you got my number.

714
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:14,547
- [Rachel] Listen.

715
00:52:14,547 --> 00:52:15,728
I found your address.

716
00:52:15,728 --> 00:52:18,594
Maybe I could just come by
and thank you in person.

717
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:20,044
- Stay the fuck away from me!

718
00:52:28,168 --> 00:52:29,806
(door opens)
(phone rings)

719
00:52:29,806 --> 00:52:32,306
(door closes)

720
00:52:53,718 --> 00:52:55,718
(sighs)

721
00:53:42,917 --> 00:53:45,584
(phone ringing)

722
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:57,144
Hello?

723
00:53:57,144 --> 00:54:02,061
- [Man] Fact or fiction, you
need a reason to sue somebody?

724
00:55:00,091 --> 00:55:01,091
- Oh my god.

725
00:55:10,216 --> 00:55:11,049
Oh my god.

726
00:55:12,094 --> 00:55:14,844
(dramatic music)

727
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,440
(slow, eerie music)

728
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:24,263
(winces)

729
00:57:25,667 --> 00:57:28,417
(dramatic music)

730
00:57:30,667 --> 00:57:32,697
(groans)

731
00:57:32,697 --> 00:57:35,530
(heavy breathing)

732
00:57:40,765 --> 00:57:42,990
Fuck.

733
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:45,990
(slow, eerie music)

734
00:57:53,789 --> 00:57:55,872
(winces)

735
00:57:56,816 --> 00:57:59,816
(slow, eerie music)

736
00:58:02,215 --> 00:58:04,500
(phone ringing)

737
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,667
What the fuck?

738
00:58:23,276 --> 00:58:25,776
(door closes)

739
00:58:51,682 --> 00:58:53,765
(winces)

740
00:59:08,541 --> 00:59:10,624
(winces)

741
00:59:11,734 --> 00:59:13,984
(grunting)

742
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:25,476
(sirens blaring)

743
00:59:46,545 --> 00:59:48,214
(laughing)

744
00:59:48,214 --> 00:59:49,047
Yes.

745
00:59:50,817 --> 00:59:51,984
Yes, yes, yes.

746
01:00:03,294 --> 01:00:04,127
Oh shit.

747
01:00:05,175 --> 01:00:06,008
Come on.

748
01:00:07,485 --> 01:00:08,318
Fuck!

749
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:13,069
Fuck.

750
01:00:13,069 --> 01:00:15,902
(heavy breathing)

751
01:00:17,805 --> 01:00:18,976
Perfect.

752
01:00:18,976 --> 01:00:21,280
(knocking)

753
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,113
Who is it?

754
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:24,243
- [Casey] Casey.

755
01:00:24,243 --> 01:00:25,076
- Come in!

756
01:00:31,445 --> 01:00:32,395
(laughs)

757
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:34,620
It's not fuckin' funny, come here.

758
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:36,463
Come on, hurry up.
- Okay.

759
01:00:38,796 --> 01:00:42,140
What the hell are you doing? (laughs)

760
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,103
Mmm, I see.

761
01:00:44,186 --> 01:00:46,090
Were you just waiting for me?

762
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:48,260
- Fuckin' uncuff me and cut me lose before

763
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:49,800
I piss all over you, please.

764
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:50,950
The key's on the floor.

765
01:00:52,255 --> 01:00:54,513
- Oh no.

766
01:00:54,513 --> 01:00:56,448
- Will you fucking get the key?

767
01:00:56,448 --> 01:00:57,281
- Fine.

768
01:00:58,775 --> 01:01:01,608
(heavy breathing)

769
01:01:12,413 --> 01:01:14,746
(urinating)

770
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:36,070
(toilet flushes)

771
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:38,143
Hey Clinton?

772
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:41,887
What's on this tape?

773
01:01:43,982 --> 01:01:45,390
(buzzing)

774
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:47,363
So then you don't remember anything?

775
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:49,613
- [Clinton] No.

776
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:53,230
- [Casey] Not even flashes?

777
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:54,063
- [Clinton] No.

778
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:57,750
- [Casey] So you don't
remember what happened after

779
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,283
we went back to my place?

780
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:02,103
- No.

781
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:06,320
- I guess that's okay.

782
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:08,953
- Okay?

783
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,183
How is it okay?

784
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,543
I wasn't the one saying
those things, Casey.

785
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:17,920
Look at you.

786
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,120
Do you realize the only
reason you're here right now

787
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,130
in my apartment is because
of a bunch of things

788
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:23,450
I never even said?

789
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:24,480
- You said them.

790
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,503
- Don't you see?

791
01:02:26,511 --> 01:02:30,340
I have been doing things,
and I don't understand why.

792
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:33,543
Okay, I can't remember having
done them, for God sake.

793
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:37,080
Yeah, I have people calling me telling me

794
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,800
that I kicked the shit out of
some guy who was my friend.

795
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,180
I have cuts and scratches
on myself and I have

796
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:45,523
no idea where the fuck they came from.

797
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:49,363
You know, who knows what
the fuck I do at night.

798
01:02:49,363 --> 01:02:50,393
What if I killed someone?

799
01:02:51,509 --> 01:02:52,883
- I don't think you killed anyone.

800
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:57,973
- Casey, do you know what
happened the first night we met?

801
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:00,500
- Yes.

802
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,830
- I know you think you know what happened,

803
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:04,650
you know, your whole
story about me coming over

804
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:07,289
and whispering a bunch
of sweet bullshit to you

805
01:03:07,289 --> 01:03:08,830
while you slept.

806
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:11,303
I'm talking about what
really fucking happened.

807
01:03:13,174 --> 01:03:15,090
- Yes.
- I stole your fuckin' money.

808
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:16,610
Your jewelry.

809
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:19,410
Okay, I was gonna take it
and never see you again.

810
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:22,373
I was gonna sell your
shit so I could buy drugs.

811
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:25,993
I fucking robbed you.

812
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:30,323
- I know.

813
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:36,313
- What?

814
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:37,146
- I know.

815
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:39,713
You told me.

816
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:43,753
- What'd I say?

817
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:47,703
- You came into my room,

818
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:51,150
and you told me that you
tried to steal from me,

819
01:03:53,495 --> 01:03:54,533
and you told me that you were sorry.

820
01:03:58,553 --> 01:04:00,190
- No.

821
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:01,023
- Yes.

822
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:06,793
- Don't you see who I am?

823
01:04:08,847 --> 01:04:10,860
I mean, it's like you've got
some weird, twisted dream

824
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:12,790
version of me in your head.

825
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:13,760
- It's not a dream.

826
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:14,993
- That's not me.

827
01:04:16,497 --> 01:04:18,983
Your fuckin' dream man is not me.

828
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:21,590
I'm a loser, all right?

829
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:22,753
This is me.

830
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:26,520
Shit, if you think it's really me,

831
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,622
why don't you pinch me
next time or something?

832
01:04:28,622 --> 01:04:29,455
- Because.

833
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:34,063
You're beautiful when you come to see me.

834
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:42,763
You've been coming to see
me for the past two weeks.

835
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:49,176
- I have?

836
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:50,009
- Yeah.

837
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:54,630
- Bullshit.

838
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:55,767
How do I act?

839
01:04:56,817 --> 01:04:57,817
- Confident.

840
01:05:00,102 --> 01:05:01,243
And you're really loving.

841
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:06,087
And you smile.

842
01:05:08,763 --> 01:05:09,596
A lot.

843
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,187
- And you're falling in
love with me, aren't you?

844
01:05:25,394 --> 01:05:26,227
- Yeah.

845
01:05:29,991 --> 01:05:32,824
- You're falling in love with him.

846
01:05:38,623 --> 01:05:39,770
You know what?

847
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:41,663
I wish I did those things.

848
01:05:43,569 --> 01:05:45,270
You don't understand.

849
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:49,610
I would give anything to
know how to say those things.

850
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:51,300
How to act that way.

851
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:53,463
- But it is you, Clinton.

852
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:56,023
You know how.

853
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,583
You're trying to forget.

854
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:04,403
- How could I forget
when I've never known?

855
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,843
- I think you've always known.

856
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:16,387
(soft acoustic music)

857
01:06:24,557 --> 01:06:26,465
(door closes)

858
01:06:26,465 --> 01:06:28,715
(knocking)

859
01:06:46,496 --> 01:06:48,163
- Time to go, buddy.

860
01:06:53,496 --> 01:06:54,329
- 1574.

861
01:06:56,791 --> 01:06:57,624
Hm.

862
01:07:17,747 --> 01:07:18,580
Clinton?

863
01:07:20,649 --> 01:07:21,482
Clinton.

864
01:07:29,601 --> 01:07:31,601
(sighs)

865
01:07:58,050 --> 01:08:00,223
- I'm gonna go over this one more time for

866
01:08:00,223 --> 01:08:01,680
a motherfucker's ass.

867
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,200
It is simple.

868
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:08,060
We are to be in there no longer
than 15 minutes, that's it.

869
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:12,497
I aint got time to be be
holding no motherfuckin' chain.

870
01:08:13,821 --> 01:08:16,238
(soft music)

871
01:08:28,722 --> 01:08:30,853
You all know your jobs, you do your jobs.

872
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:35,433
- Hey.

873
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:38,080
You brought it, right?

874
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:39,943
- What?

875
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:43,843
- The gun, you fuckin' moron.

876
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,287
Jesus Christ.

877
01:09:20,814 --> 01:09:23,814
(slow, eerie music)

878
01:09:44,656 --> 01:09:47,906
(dramatic synth music)

879
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,663
- Don't nobody fuck this up.

880
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:08,950
(dramatic synth music)

881
01:10:28,984 --> 01:10:33,067
(dramatic industrial rock music)

882
01:10:58,914 --> 01:11:01,664
(dramatic music)

883
01:11:06,698 --> 01:11:09,186
- Clint.
(dramatic music)

884
01:11:09,186 --> 01:11:14,186
Clint!
(dramatic music)

885
01:11:16,179 --> 01:11:18,679
- [Clinton] How could I forget

886
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:22,143
when I've never known?

887
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:24,683
You know what happened the
night that you and I met?

888
01:11:28,085 --> 01:11:31,252
(soft acoustic music)

889
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:35,890
- [Casey] You've been coming to see me

890
01:11:39,335 --> 01:11:40,485
for the past two weeks.

891
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,893
- [Clinton] Who knows what
the fuck I do at night?

892
01:11:48,627 --> 01:11:50,673
You know what if I, you know
what if I killed someone?

893
01:11:52,872 --> 01:11:54,883
Forget when I've never known?

894
01:11:56,011 --> 01:11:57,123
You know what if I killed someone?

895
01:12:01,607 --> 01:12:06,590
Do you know what happened
the night that you and I met?

896
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:10,070
(dramatic, frenzied music)

897
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:11,558
You weren't mad?

898
01:12:11,558 --> 01:12:13,642
Don't you see the person that I am?

899
01:12:13,642 --> 01:12:14,584
- [Casey] Yeah.

900
01:12:14,584 --> 01:12:17,417
(heavy breathing)

901
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:25,139
- What am I doing?

902
01:12:29,456 --> 01:12:31,539
(grunts)

903
01:12:39,370 --> 01:12:42,037
(van starts up)

904
01:12:45,415 --> 01:12:48,582
(soft acoustic music)

905
01:13:08,511 --> 01:13:10,761
(knocking)

906
01:13:11,847 --> 01:13:15,014
(soft acoustic music)

907
01:13:27,076 --> 01:13:27,909
Hi.

908
01:13:29,386 --> 01:13:30,219
- Hey.

909
01:13:31,356 --> 01:13:34,523
(soft acoustic music)

910
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:45,723
- Yeah.

911
01:13:46,913 --> 01:13:48,073
I remember this now.

912
01:13:56,228 --> 01:13:57,680
Do you know what it
feels like to know that

913
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,113
it was me all along?

914
01:14:02,088 --> 01:14:03,171
- I told you.

915
01:14:08,755 --> 01:14:11,535
- I've done so many horrible things.

916
01:14:11,535 --> 01:14:12,400
- Listen to me.

917
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,023
You have so much time to make up for it.

918
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:18,880
You've already started to,
and you don't even know it.

919
01:14:21,992 --> 01:14:26,631
- When I think about all those
awful things I said to you...

920
01:14:26,631 --> 01:14:27,464
- Shh.

921
01:14:29,257 --> 01:14:33,792
I forgot about them the
second they left your mouth.

922
01:14:33,792 --> 01:14:35,792
I knew they weren't you.

923
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:40,250
- I remember all of this.

924
01:14:42,972 --> 01:14:43,972
All of this.

925
01:14:46,293 --> 01:14:47,460
- I'm so glad.

926
01:14:48,459 --> 01:14:51,626
(soft acoustic music)

927
01:14:58,832 --> 01:14:59,749
- Hey, hey.

928
01:15:02,758 --> 01:15:05,508
I have to leave town for a while.

929
01:15:08,302 --> 01:15:09,937
- Okay.

930
01:15:09,937 --> 01:15:10,770
Um...

931
01:15:13,026 --> 01:15:14,693
Can I come with you?

932
01:15:16,278 --> 01:15:19,445
(soft acoustic music)

933
01:15:25,997 --> 01:15:28,247
(laughing)

934
01:15:29,242 --> 01:15:32,409
(soft acoustic music)

935
01:15:42,378 --> 01:15:43,693
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

936
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,140
(dramatic music)

937
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:08,332
(hits)
(grunts)

938
01:16:08,332 --> 01:16:10,020
- You motherfucker.

939
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:11,627
- Don't shoot me, please, please.

940
01:16:11,627 --> 01:16:13,518
- Go ahead and beg me motherfucker.

941
01:16:13,518 --> 01:16:15,150
You thought you could fuck with me.

942
01:16:15,150 --> 01:16:17,010
You were lucky I was high.

943
01:16:17,010 --> 01:16:19,227
But that don't make a
difference now, does it?

944
01:16:19,227 --> 01:16:20,158
- I'm begging you man.

945
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:21,520
- You better talk real fast.

946
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,820
- You see I met this girl.

947
01:16:24,268 --> 01:16:26,647
And she's amazing.

948
01:16:26,647 --> 01:16:30,230
And she really cares about me.

949
01:16:30,230 --> 01:16:32,730
And I'm in love with her, man.

950
01:16:34,474 --> 01:16:36,641
(gunshot)

951
01:16:38,216 --> 01:16:41,216
(slow, eerie music)

952
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:01,238
Look, I know I'm a son of a bitch,

953
01:17:01,238 --> 01:17:03,794
Bert, and I don't deserve
to take another breath,

954
01:17:03,794 --> 01:17:05,582
but I want to.

955
01:17:05,582 --> 01:17:07,063
I want to live.

956
01:17:07,063 --> 01:17:12,063
I would give anything for
you not to pull that trigger.

957
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:15,022
You see, I met this girl.

958
01:17:15,022 --> 01:17:16,522
And she's amazing.

959
01:17:17,588 --> 01:17:20,822
And she really cares about me.

960
01:17:20,822 --> 01:17:23,740
And I'm in love with her man.

961
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:25,907
(gunshot)

962
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:44,007
(heavy breathing)

963
01:17:44,007 --> 01:17:44,840
Thank you.

964
01:17:50,517 --> 01:17:53,350
(heavy breathing)

965
01:17:56,807 --> 01:17:57,890
- Is he dead?

966
01:18:00,887 --> 01:18:01,720
- Yeah.

967
01:18:03,302 --> 01:18:05,885
(gun clatters)

968
01:18:08,739 --> 01:18:11,489
(dramatic music)

969
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:16,929
(sniffling)

970
01:18:16,929 --> 01:18:19,012
- Do you remember me yet?

971
01:18:21,266 --> 01:18:22,099
- Yeah.

972
01:18:22,985 --> 01:18:23,985
Your name is Rachel.

973
01:18:25,253 --> 01:18:26,086
- Yeah.

974
01:18:26,086 --> 01:18:26,919
- Yeah.

975
01:18:29,745 --> 01:18:30,943
(sniffling)

976
01:18:30,943 --> 01:18:32,093
Um, Rachel?

977
01:18:33,598 --> 01:18:35,430
I'm wondering if maybe you
shouldn't have done that.

978
01:18:38,636 --> 01:18:39,969
- [Rachel] What?

979
01:18:41,964 --> 01:18:46,431
- Just, I don't know if
I deserved it or not.

980
01:18:46,431 --> 01:18:48,181
- I don't understand.

981
01:18:56,570 --> 01:18:58,533
Wait, where are you going?

982
01:19:00,352 --> 01:19:03,352
(slow, eerie music)

983
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:11,703
You found it.

984
01:19:14,224 --> 01:19:15,057
Thank you.

985
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:19,143
- I wanna tell you how I got that.

986
01:19:24,779 --> 01:19:26,967
- Probably while you were
carrying me to the hospital.

987
01:19:30,225 --> 01:19:31,058
- No.

988
01:19:34,814 --> 01:19:37,814
(slow, eerie music)

989
01:19:46,557 --> 01:19:48,724
(sobbing)

990
01:19:56,616 --> 01:20:00,204
- You see why I don't know
if you should have done that?

991
01:20:00,204 --> 01:20:02,954
(Rachel sobbing)

992
01:20:10,562 --> 01:20:13,752
(dramatic music)

993
01:20:13,752 --> 01:20:16,752
(gunshot)
Oh, fuck!

994
01:20:18,485 --> 01:20:19,318
Oh, fuck.

995
01:20:21,892 --> 01:20:22,725
God.

996
01:20:23,602 --> 01:20:25,769
