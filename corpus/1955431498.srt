879
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:17,279
- The [CHINESE WORD]
is the reflection of the spirits

terrible unshakable terror,

the [CHINESE WORD] will use

00:55:33,264 --> 00:55:36,899
to disable its enemies.

886
00:55:36,934 --> 00:55:42,471
It can paralyze its targets,
make them sitting ducks

take its time.
