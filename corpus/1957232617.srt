1
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,494
[dark, brooding music playing]

2
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,671
[woman breathing heavily]

3
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,926
[woman breathing shakily]

4
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:54,596
[gasps]

5
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,764
[breathing rapidly]

6
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,392
[haunting music plays]

7
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,027
[children shouting playfully in distance]

8
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,652
[laptop buzzing softly]

9
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,505
[haunting music continues]

10
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,351
- [woman] <i>What are you eating?</i>
- [girl] <i>Guess.</i>

11
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,097
- [woman] <i>I can't guess.</i>
- [girl in sing-song] <i>Bet you can.</i>

12
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,325
- [woman] <i>How can I guess?</i>
- [girl] <i>What day is it today?</i>

13
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,809
[woman] <i>Uh, it's Monday.</i>

14
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,853
<i>Oh. Sunday night's pizza night.</i>

15
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,747
<i>- You're eating leftover pizza.</i>
- [girl giggles]

16
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:30,233
<i>Hey, make Dad go pick you out a pumpkin.
It's that time of year again.</i>

17
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,734
<i>- They're all over.</i>
- [buzzer rings]

18
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,194
- [girl] <i>Okay.</i>
- [woman] <i>All right.</i>

19
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,840
<i>- Let me talk to Daddy, sweetheart.</i>
- [boy over intercom] <i>Delivery.</i>

20
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,240
- [girl] <i>Daddy!</i>
- [buzzing]

21
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,117
<i>Daddy!</i>

22
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,000
[meowing]

23
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,421
- [man] <i>Hey, Slugger.</i>
- [woman] <i>Hey.</i>

24
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,733
[man] <i>Tell me something good.</i>
- [woman] <i>Something good.</i>

25
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,801
[both chuckle]

26
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,637
- [woman]<i> You were right about 101.</i>
- [man] <i>How's that?</i>

27
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,557
[woman] <i>The Russells are very white.</i>
[chuckles]

28
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,143
[man] <i>There goes the neighborhood.</i>
[chuckles]

29
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,854
[woman] <i>But who moves in</i>
<i>after a one-day paint job?</i>

30
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,148
[man] <i>Well, you said it was in good shape.</i>

31
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,194
[woman] <i>I wish you were here.</i>

32
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,864
- [man] <i>Who does that help, saying that?</i>
- [woman] <i>I can beat myself up if I want.</i>

33
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,742
[man] <i>Go for it.</i>
<i>It's just an audience of one.</i>

34
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:21,993
<i>I'm not playing.</i>

35
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,621
[woman] <i>Tell me to go outside.</i>

36
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:28,124
[man] <i>Why not make today</i>
<i>the day you go outside?</i>

37
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,877
So, what's the latest on the street?

38
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,088
What happened with the barking dog?

39
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,508
I thought we were going
to talk about medications.

40
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,843
We'll get there.

41
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,387
Would you like to take a seat?

42
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,848
Did it get squared away?

43
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:44,932
The dog?

44
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,101
Um…

45
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,104
I guess they started bringing him inside.

46
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,940
Did you end up calling 311?

47
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,150
[chuckles] Oh, David talked me out of it.

48
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,820
It's more of a bother for him anyway.
It's louder downstairs.

49
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,907
So, I… must have talked to somebody.

50
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,325
Peaceful resolution.

51
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,869
This is the second session
that you've done this.

52
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,454
Ask about the neighborhood?

53
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,832
Does that make you uncomfortable?

54
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,293
I just don't know what you're goin' for.

55
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,587
How's the prayer group?

56
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,799
[woman sighs] They're getting by.

57
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,343
[man]
Do you think they know you're watching?

58
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,512
Is this really what you wanna talk about?

59
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,057
What about 101?

60
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,143
Looks like they already moved in.

61
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,645
What'd they pay?

62
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,939
Five-five. They were asking for six.

63
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,148
Who are they?

64
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,275
The Russells.

65
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,736
Alistair and Jane.
The broker says they're from Boston.

66
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,988
Where's the money from?

67
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,948
She says he's a banker.

68
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,117
But there's practically
nothing about them online.

69
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,493
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

70
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,203
What the fuck, Karl?

71
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:51,291
Curiosity is evidence
of a decreased depression pattern.

72
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,712
People who snoop on their neighbors
don't kill themselves? [chuckles]

73
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,256
Let's try this.

74
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,342
People who attempt suicide
lose the right to joke about it.

75
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,889
I have a review with Dr. Kenner this week.

76
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,310
Seeing as I've been unable to get you
out the front door for the last 10 months,

77
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,437
she's gonna wonder about
the source of my optimism.

78
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,189
Let's talk about the Elevan.

79
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,525
Now that you've curtailed the drinking,

80
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,569
how are you feeling
about the side effects?

81
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,363
[sloshing]

82
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,032
[man] <i>I think you're reading into it.</i>

83
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:27,744
[woman] <i>I've been a shrink for 15 years.</i>
<i>I know a threat when I hear one.</i>

84
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,162
[man] <i>He's on your side, Slugger.</i>

85
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,997
<i>He's the reason you're still here.</i>

86
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,666
[woman] <i>It's not really therapy</i>
<i>if there's a knife at your back.</i>

87
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,003
[man] <i>He comes every week, rain or shine.</i>
<i>He's been there all the way through.</i>

88
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,589
[woman]
<i>No, he's getting off on controlling me.</i>

89
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,008
- [man] <i>Really?</i>
- [woman] <i>Yes. Did you read about Elevan?</i>

90
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,384
<i>Take a look at the side effects.</i>

91
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,428
[man]
<i>I know you're not supposed to drink on it.</i>

92
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,430
[woman chuckles] <i>They always say that.</i>

93
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,516
[insistent music playing]

94
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,075
[trumpet playing]

95
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,332
[sighs]

96
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,841
[woman breathing heavily]

97
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,305
- [buzzer rings]
- [gasps]

98
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,681
[glass shatters]

99
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,849
Shit.

100
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,267
[paper rustling]

101
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,607
[insistent music swelling]

102
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,942
[buzzer rings]

103
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,778
Yes?

104
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:46,572
[boy over speaker]
<i>I live, um, across the street there.</i>

105
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,990
And?

106
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,494
<i>My mom asked me to give you this.</i>

107
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,413
I'm sorry…

108
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,332
I'm not prepared for visitors.

109
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,084
[boy] <i>Oh, okay.</i>

110
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,962
<i>Do you have any ideas about
what I should do with this?</i>

111
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,589
You can just…

112
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,468
Push the door.

113
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,762
[buzzer sounds]

114
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,807
Hi. I'm Ethan.

115
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,890
Yes.

116
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,601
Hi. Anna.

117
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,771
I'm from… across the street.

118
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
[Anna] Yes.

119
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,443
Sorry, I know you're not having,
uh, visitors.

120
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,153
No, I'm… fine.

121
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,029
You just surprised me, that's all.

122
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,323
I'm not really a visitor so much.

123
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,034
I'm kind of, uh, more like a neighbor.

124
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,207
- I love lavender.
- Heh.

125
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,586
My mom asked me
to give it to you, like… days ago.

126
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,881
I think that I'm the one
supposed to be giving you a gift, eh…

127
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,382
Welcome to the neighborhood.

128
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,925
- [cat meows]
- [Ethan] Mm.

129
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,725
I like cats' tongues.

130
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,479
Sorry they're not fish fingers, buddy.
[chuckles]

131
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,730
He likes you.

132
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,689
No.

133
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,693
How do you like your new house?

134
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,278
I miss the old one.

135
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,031
But we had to leave Boston.

136
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,284
Are those your… people?

137
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,827
Family? Yes.

138
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:16,953
Are they home?

139
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,501
No, they don't live here. We're separated.

140
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,128
How old is she?

141
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,547
She's eight.

142
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,968
How old are you?

143
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,638
I'm gonna be 16 in six months.

144
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,722
Five months.

145
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:42,938
What do you do?

146
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,319
Oh, I'm a psychologist. I work with kids.

147
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,402
Really?

148
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:50,947
Really.

149
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,407
- That's interesting.
- Why is that interesting?

150
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:57,370
I mean, it's more interesting
than, like, working at Taco Bell.

151
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,497
- [chuckles]
- Why would kids need a psychologist?

152
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,850
You really don't know why
a kid would need a psychologist?

153
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,460
No, I mean, I'm sure they do,
but I mean, like, why?

154
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,463
Like, why do the kids who see you
need a psychologist?

155
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,675
- All sorts of reasons.
- School shootings or torturing someone?

156
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:14,720
No, it doesn't have to be that dramatic.
Some of them are depressed,

157
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,305
some suffer from anxiety…

158
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,142
Some of them are… just having
a hard time adjusting to a new place.

159
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,362
I can see your house from my room.

160
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:34,240
[elusive music plays]

161
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,866
I mean…

162
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,701
Normally.

163
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,956
Right now, I can see…

164
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,001
My dad from your house.

165
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,296
[Ethan sighs]

166
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,383
Are you okay?

167
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:55,635
[Ethan] Yeah.

168
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,680
Are you sure?

169
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,641
No, nothing, I just…

170
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,727
[softly] Hey.

171
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,103
[gasps softly]

172
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,566
You can talk to me.

173
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,736
I don't know anyone here.

174
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,820
You know me.

175
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,656
Not really.

176
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,284
Well, you could.

177
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:19,952
Really?

178
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,954
We-we can be friends?

179
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,082
Sure.

180
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,171
Wow. You have a lot of movies.

181
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,424
Too many. That's what my husband says.

182
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,052
I thought you said
you guys were separated.

183
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,638
He's still my husband, but you're right.

184
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,682
You're welcome to borrow anything.

185
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:45,144
Uh… My dad's kind of a tyrant with the TV.

186
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,479
Oh.

187
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,486
- Goodbye, Punch.
- [purrs]

188
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,696
I'm sorry I'm so allergic to you.

189
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,491
Why didn't you say something?

190
00:10:59,075 --> 00:10:59,992
Oh.

191
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,661
I don't wanna offend him.

192
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,954
He's not that sensitive.

193
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,538
Okay.

194
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,250
[Punch meows softly]

195
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,007
Okay, then.

196
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,759
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

197
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,014
See you around?

198
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,182
Yeah, see you around.

199
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,103
[elusive music turns warmer]

200
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:31,440
<i>…in some incredibly rustic community
where good manners are unknown…</i>

201
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,360
[man and Anna] …or you suffer
from the common feminine delusion

202
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,195
that the mere fact of being a woman

203
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,948
exempts you from the rules
of civilized conduct.

204
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,241
[Anna] Conduct.

205
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,044
- [man and Anna] Possibly both.
- [laughing]

206
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,704
[woman on TV] <i>Possibly.</i>
<i>But here's what I wanted to show you…</i>

207
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,080
[continues laughing]

208
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,041
[coughing]

209
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,630
[laughing]

210
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,675
[loud thud]

211
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,847
- [Anna shudders]
- [electrical ringing]

212
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:10,271
- [buzzer ringing]
- [kids chattering outside]

213
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,390
[man] I'm headed to Brooklyn.

214
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,277
- You need me to take care of anything?
- Right. Uh, no. Thanks, I'm good.

215
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,028
[man] Sure? Take out the garbage?

216
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,407
- Okay. As long as you're here.
- [man] Okay.

217
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,995
You know, David, you've been
my tenant for three months.

218
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,371
You don't have to be so formal.

219
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,665
You can just come in through
the basement stairs.

220
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,418
- No, I don't wanna startle ya.
- [bottles clinking]

221
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,503
It's dark in here.
Do the bulbs need changing?

222
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,298
- I like it dim.
- Okay.

223
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,301
Oh, Halloween tonight.

224
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,762
How do we do it without you going outside?

225
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,722
You want me to get some candy?

226
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,307
I'm not going to give out candy.

227
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,671
I'm going to turn the lights out
and pretend I'm not home.

228
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,733
We could just get a bowl of candy
and leave it on the porch, like…

229
00:12:56,567 --> 00:13:00,154
Any kid would take it within a minute
and then they'd take the bowl.

230
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:03,449
Why don't we get a bowl of apples?
'Cause kids won't take apples.

231
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,576
Then what's the point?

232
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,040
Yeah. Okay.

233
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,126
Have a nice time.

234
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,337
Sure. Happy Halloween.

235
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,339
[door closes]

236
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,133

- Hey!

258

Hey.

270
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,494
You're gonna have to convince me
I don't need to call an ambulance.

271
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,121
[Anna] No, don't do that.

272
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,790
Okay, you know who you are?
You know what day it is?

273
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,502
Yeah, I'm Anna. It's Halloween.

274
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,754
Okay, how many fingers?

275
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,588
Three.

276
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,051
Okay. You're all right.
You're gonna be all right. Just…

277
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,761
Breathing would be good.

278
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,639
I was headed across the street

279
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,599
when those little shits
started chucking eggs,

280
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,142
and, oof, you went down hard.

281
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,310
You're Jane Russell.

282
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,313
What makes you say that?

283
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,608
[Anna] Your… your son came by.

284
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:43,984
Ethan.

285
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,195
[Jane]
Sit up in case you got a concussion.

286
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,365
- [faucet runs]
- [Jane] Jesus, it's dark in here.

287
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,033
Do you faint a lot?

288
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,577
I didn't faint.

289
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,788
I mean, it's… like fainting.

290
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,666
- [Jane pours drink]
- I can't go outside.

291
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,418
Um… you didn't go outside.

292
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,421
- No, I get panic attacks.
- Who doesn't?

293
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,590
Here. Have some of this brandy, please.

294
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,717
Uh, I'm agoraphobic.

295
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,721
I can't go outside.

296
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,392
Oh! Oh. [chuckles]

297
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,144
You're stuck inside this shitty house.
Oh. [clicks tongue]

298
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,481
Oh, man. I'd hate to be stuck
inside a house this shitty.

299
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,274
[muffled thud]

300
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,068
Is that your husband coming home?

301
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,696
It's my tenant.

302
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,990
He lives in the basement.

303
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,619
So, um, what do you do all day?

304
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,037
I mean, do you work?

305
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,794
Oh, God, I'm so fucking nosy.

306
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:47,506
I… I should just go. Um...

307
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,466
- Do you want me to go?
- No.

308
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,218
Um…

309
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,553
No, it's…

310
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,346
It's all right. I'm fine.

311
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,598
I… counsel people.

312
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,058
You counsel people?

313
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,020
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, you're a shrink.

314
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,522
Oh! [chuckles] That's a twist.

315
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,191
You married?

316
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,361
- Separated.
- Ah.

317
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,196
And kids?

318
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,034
My daughter Olivia is with her father.

319
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,869
Oh, that's tough.

320
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,328
Yeah.

321
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,290
Yeah. Separated from your kid,
that's really tough.

322
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,959
I talk to them every day.

323
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,420
Yeah, it's just… It's...

324
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,965
It's not the same as them
being here, though, is it?

325
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,553
Take another drink, please.

326
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,521
- Do you wanna go outside?
- You know, I have a shrink of my own.

327
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,775
[laughing] Okay. Okay. I get it. I get it.

328
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,569
All right, sorry. That sounds very wise.

329
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,653
Yeah.

330
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,948
I get it. [chuckles]

331
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,408
Yeah.

332
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,826
Yeah.

333
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:02,498
We've been trying to get me
to go outside using an umbrella.

334
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,665
Uh-huh.

335
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,960
I haven't… been able to do it yet.

336
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,378
Oh. [smacks lips]

337
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,879
You will.

338
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:11,507
You will.

339
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,716
You'll figure it out.

340
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,010
- [pops cork]
- [Jane] Notice I'm not asking

341
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,179
- what made you this way.
- [Anna] What way?

342
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,388
Agoraphobic.

343
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,391
I have anxiety. I have…

344
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,811
An anxiety disorder.

345
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,230
- Punch. [clicking tongue] Punch.
- So, um…

346
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,273
- [camera clicks]
- Good boy.

347
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,109
That's what all these pills are for?

348
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,235
- [Anna] Mm-hmm.
- Huh.

349
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,779
So, what does… what does this one do?

350
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,072
This, uh, pink one.

351
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,573
Uh, that's Inderal.

352
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,617
Ah. Beta blocker.

353
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,785
How do you know that?

354
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,121
Um, 'cause it says so on the bottle.

355
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,456
[both chuckle]

356
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,793
Pretty sure you're not supposed to be…
taking these with alcohol.

357
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,378
[Anna] Mm.

358
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,548
[inhales deeply]

359
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,092
Thank you for the candle.

360
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,428
Ethan brought it by. Thanks.

361
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,722
Oh. Wow, okay, subject change.

362
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,141
[clicks tongue] Uh-uh.

363
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,725
I think I hurt my neck.

364
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,978
- [both chuckle]
- He's a nice boy.

365
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,025
- Look.
- Oh, what a cutie.

366
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,152
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

367
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,155
He's my guy. My little baby guy.

368
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:21,160
You know, when you have a kid,
you say, "He's my kid, my guy,"

369
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,495
Like he's yours, like he belongs to you.

370
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,248
- That's not really how it feels.
- You belong to them.

371
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,332
Right.

372
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,418
Right.

373
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,003
You belong to them.

374
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,088
And maybe you never belonged
to anybody before.

375
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,383
I mean, maybe, maybe you thought
you belonged to your parents.

376
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:39,094
You grew out of that. You certainly
didn't belong to your husband.

377
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,597
Then this kid comes along,
and he's just got you.

378
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,851
[laughs] I don't have to tell you that.

379
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,984
[Jane sips drink]

380
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,071
I like your earrings.

381
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,949
Oh. Oh, thanks, yeah. A gift.

382
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,619
They're a gift from an old boyfriend.

383
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,953
Does your husband mind?

384
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,455
I doubt he knows.

385
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:10,000
[both laugh]

386
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,501
He has trust issues.

387
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,628
Oh, why is that?

388
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,671
- Oh, I don't know.
- You don't know? Mmm.

389
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:18,300
No. Come on, no, no.
I don't know. I don't know.

390
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,177
- No, it's… [clears throat]
- Hmm.

391
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,223
[sucks teeth] Who knows
why he has them? Um…

392
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,184
He's a good guy, he's a good father.

393
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,310
He's just, you know…

394
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,938
- He's tight.
- [Anna] Mm.

395
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,397
Controlling, and like…

396
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:37,152
I have my own issues,
but I work through them and…

397
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,528
I can handle them.

398
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,073
Maybe sometimes I have to…

399
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,617
Get in between them and I...

400
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,536
I worry about Ethan, 'cause…

401
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,747
He's sensitive.

402
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,008
Family's…

403
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,803
Complicated.

404
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,304
[paper rustling]

405
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,139
[scratching on paper]

406
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,142
Why is your family complicated?

407
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,025
{\an8}- [Jane] Look.
- Oh, wow! That's amazing!

408
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,486
Yeah. Jane Russell original.

409
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,946
[Jane chuckles]

410
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,282
- See how I changed the subject on you?
- I did.

411
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,534
Yeah, you don't know
who you're fooling with.

412
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,662
[both laughing]

413
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:33,292
- [laughter]
- [indistinct conversation]

414
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,880
[uneasy music playing]

415
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,871
[intercom buzzer rings]

416
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,539
[Anna] Hello?

417
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,708
<i>Uh, it's Alistair Russell.</i>

418
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,961
<i>We-we-we we moved in
just across the street. 101.</i>

419
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,881
- [buzzer sounds]
- [Anna] Push the door.

420
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,350
I… I'm sorry to bother you.

421
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,894
I just wanted to know…

422
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:38,774
Well, I'm just curious if any of my family
has come around to see you this evening.

423
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,109
No.

424
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,198
Oh.

425
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,117
No, I... I've been alone.

426
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,121
[softly stomps]

427
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,539
Okay, thanks.

428
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,125
Sorry to bother you.

429
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,087
Thank your wife.

430
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,256
For the candle. Ethan brought it over.

431
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,174
Days ago.

432
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,137
Good.

433
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,475
- [creaking]
- [door slams]

434
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,338

435
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,229
[Anna gasps]

436
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:20,273
[suspenseful music playing]

437
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,884
- [breathing shakily]
- [phone line ringing]

438
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,975
[dispatcher] <i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

439
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,227
[Anna] I think there's somebody
in my house.

440
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,396
<i>What's your address, ma'am?</i>

441
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:03,483
It's 104, West 121st Street.

442
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,862
- [screams] I'm sorry.
- [man] Whoa!

443
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,840
- It's David.
- [dispatcher] <i>Ma'am, are you okay?</i>

444
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,949
Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

445
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,701
<i>- Ma'am?</i>
- Yeah, I know him.

446
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,661
It's a false alarm. I'm sorry.

447
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,746
I... I buzzed.
I did buzz half an hour ago.

448
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,249
[sighing heavily]

449
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,210
And I cleaned the eggs
off your front porch.

450
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,796
What are you looking for?

451
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,924
A guy across the street
asked me to help him open some boxes,

452
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,176
store some stuff.

453
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,720
I thought you might have a box cutter.

454
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:35,432
I didn't know you were a handyman.
I thought you were a singer-songwriter.

455
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:36,892
Which is why I am a handyman.

456
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,643
[chuckles]

457
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,485
You know you've got mold?

458
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,861
Yeah, I do.

459
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,741
[groans]

460
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,744
David, come back inside!

461
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,539
David?

462
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,001
- Boo!
- [gasps]

463
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,878
- Shit!
- [David laughing]

464
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,176
[David] You're gonna need a pro
to seal that roof. It's dangerous.

465
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,385
I'll call somebody.

466
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,137
You okay?

467
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,221
Yes.

468
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,016
Who were you working with
across the street?

469
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,850
Russell.

470
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,685
You know him?

471
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,439
How did he find you?

472
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,899
I put up some flyers.

473
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,778

texted to you.</i>

480
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:55,845

- [Ethan on phone] <i>Uh, hello?</i>
- [Anna] Ethan.

483
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,810
It's Anna, across the street.

484
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,271
[Ethan] <i>Hi.</i> [groans softly]

485
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:07,065
Is something going on over there?
I heard a scream.

486
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,401
<i>No, no. It's fine.</i>

487
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,529
I heard somebody scream. Was it you?

- A scream. A scream.
- [Alistair panting]

Uh, a minute ago.

<i>A scream?</i>

507
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,790
Yeah, from your house.

508
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,126
<i>Sorry, the only people here
are me and my boy.</i>

509
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,295

- across the street?
- No.

Now. Five minutes ago.

It doesn't matter.

703
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,834
The point is, Dr. Fox,
that nothing's happened.

704
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:52,830
- No.
- Hmm?

705
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,248
No! I know what I saw!

706
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,376
- Nothing's happened to anyone.
- No, I was zoomed in with the camera.

707
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,937
- Did you take a picture?
- I did not!

She's just admitted
she's spying on our house.

- Mr. Russell…
- Why didn't you take a picture?

710
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,634
The important thing is,
is that everybody's okay, yeah?

I'm Jane Russell.

718

She's not Jane.

719
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,038
I promise I am.

720
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:35,956
No, you're not Jane.

721
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,958
She's not Jane. I know Jane.

722
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,168
Jane's been in my house.

723
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,378

See you at the block party.

You made a 911 call yesterday
about an intruder in your house?

734
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:26,799
No.

735
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,343
I mean, yes. But that was a mistake.

736
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:32,012
It's a criminal offense
to make false police reports.

737
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,931
Thank you, Detective.

738
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,476
Am I okay to leave you alone, Dr. Fox?

739

Look, you need anything,
you, um, you call me.

You don't. You're just wrong.

You cannot slap that boy.

all of us have, but this…

<i>This</i> stops now.

945
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:02,179
Your relationship with Ethan,
it's inappropriate.

946
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:03,972
He's a young man! He's a…

947
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:06,683
He's a boy! He's 15-and-a-half

948
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,768
and you're a mature woman!

949
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:12,022
And of course, you're completely
out of your goddamn mind!

950

[nervously] I'll call the police!

Go. Go ahead.

952
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,527
Go ahead. I'm sure they'd love
hearing from you.

A... A drunken, shut-in,
pill-popping cat lady!

You…

955
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:28,705
You're fucking with the wrong family.

And there's her little nose.
And all the beautiful flowers.

Punch, what is it? Huh?

982
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:35,016
You don't have any idea
who could've sent you this?

983
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,311
No, the only person
who has a key is my tenant, David.

984
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:39,479
Yeah, where is he?

985
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:40,897
I don't know.

986
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,400
- Are you having problems with David?
- No. I mean, no. I…

987
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,944
- [Norelli] Nothing up here.
- You see, coast is clear.

988
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:48,113
- Can you track the email?
- Track it?

989
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:50,424
- Or trace it? Whatever.
- You can't track a Gmail account.

990
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:52,784
- You could've sent this to yourself.
- I'm sleeping.

991
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:55,954
- Or you wanted to look asleep.
- [Anna] I'm asleep. What the hell?

992
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:58,248
- [buzzer ringing]
- Dr. Fox, there is no sign…

993
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:00,792
That anyone has been here, okay?
Nothing is missing.

994
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:04,421
- [Norelli] Doors and windows look okay.
- Someone has been in my house.

995
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:06,131
- I have given you proof.
- [door opens]

996
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:08,425
[Alistair] She called my office in Boston!

997
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:11,678
- Did you know that? She's called my house!
- [Little] Damn it! Mr. Russell.

998
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:12,761
Why were you fired?

999
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:14,431
- She spies on our house!
- All right.

1000
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,683
She lured my son into her home!

1001
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:17,851
He is abusive.

1002
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,061
She is harassing my son.
She is harassing my...

1003
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,147
He hit his son. I saw him hit his son.

1004
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,314
She's delusional.

1005
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:25,692
Ethan told me, Jane told me,
I saw him do it.

1006
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:28,278
- Um…
- <i>She</i> is Jane!

1007
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,657
You are a drunk and a drug addict
and you made it all up!

1008
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,452
You almost had me believing that
and then I found this.

1009
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:37,745
What's this?

1010
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:40,623
This is a picture that
your wife drew and signed.

1011
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:44,043
And you call me delusional,
you motherfucker.

1012
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,045
- [Norelli] Hey, hey!
- It's you.

1013
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,214
She was here.

1014
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:51,468
- That proves it.
- [Alistair] That doesn't prove anything.

1015
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,970
That proves you're out of your mind.

1016
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:55,638
What's happening?

1017
00:57:58,266 --> 00:57:59,266
Door was open.

1018
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:02,353
- Who are you?
- [David] I live downstairs.

1019
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:05,315
It's my tenant. That's David.

1020
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:09,277
- [Norelli] Got a last name, David?
- No. Just David. Like Sting.

1021
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,363
It's Winters. His last name is Winters.

1022
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:15,033
It's just Winter, actually. Singular.

1023
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:16,993
Where were you last night, Mr. Winters?

1024
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:20,622
In Connecticut. On a job. Why?

1025
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,624
Somebody took a photo
of Dr. Fox in her sleep…

1026
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:25,043
Around 2:00 a.m.
and then e-mailed it to her.

1027
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:26,627
Someone broke in?

1028
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,755
How do we know it was last night?

1029
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,958
Can anyone confirm
you were in Connecticut last night?

1030
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:33,426
Yeah. The lady I was with.

1031
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,552
I'm gonna need her number.

1032
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,640
You can call her. Her name is Elizabeth.

1033
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:41,893
Dr. Fox says she saw a woman
assaulted in Mr. Russell's house.

1034
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,312
You know anything about that?

1035
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:46,648
- No.
- Have you ever met Mrs. Russell?

1036
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,441
No.

1037
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:53,112
Her earring is beside your bed
on your nightstand, that little rose.

1038
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,572
Jane Russell's earring.

1039
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,574
What were you doing
in your tenant's bedroom?

1040
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,412
She has some serious privacy issues.

1041
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,915
[oppressive music plays]

1042
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:05,959
Well… how do you do?

1043
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,129
That earring belongs to a woman I know.

1044
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,090
And who is that woman?

1045
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:13,633
Her name is Katherine.

1046
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:15,927
She spent the night here last week.

1047
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,889
You took a box cutter from me.

1048
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:21,599
You loaned it to me.

1049
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,893
Checks out. He was in Darien last night.

1050
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,899
He was in prison for assault.

1051
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,694
He was in prison.
He shouldn't be in New York.

1052
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:36,489
He's been in her house.
He must have met her.

1053
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:43,705
Her earring is beside his bed
and he borrowed a knife from me,

1054
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:45,331
and he's been in prison.

1055
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:51,004
And he was fired from his job.

1056
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,756
His assistant died.

1057
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,802
He threatened me.

1058
00:59:57,885 --> 00:59:59,345
In my home.

1059
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,015
He beats his child.

1060
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:03,891
I'm a child psychologist.

1061
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:07,604
I know how to identify
a child who's in danger,

1062
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:08,938
who's being abused.

1063
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:13,610
And I saw Alistair slap Ethan
in my home yesterday.

1064
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:16,988
Wait... W...

1065
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,824
Yes, yes. Yesterday.

1066
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:23,493
I see…

1067
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:27,123
I see the way
that you're all looking at me.

1068
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,752
I'm not crazy.

1069
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:34,756
I'm not hallucinating.
Do I seem unreasonable?

1070
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,467
I have evidence.

1071
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:42,430
There was that picture
that Jane drew and she signed,

1072
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:45,725
and there's a photograph
that somebody took of me

1073
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,060
while I was sleeping.

1074
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:51,481
Look, it doesn't matter
what you think about me,

1075
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:55,109
if you approve of me,
if you think that I'm reliable.

1076
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:59,113
There is a boy in danger in that house.

1077
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,782
Just help him, please.

1078
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:03,159
[delicate music plays faintly]

1079
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:04,242
You're a father.

1080
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,998
I would think that you would want
to help a child.

1081
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,335
If my husband were here…

1082
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:14,671
He would help.

1083
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,465
He would believe me.

1084
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:20,510
[Norelli] Dr. Fox, your family is dead.

1085
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:23,680
I don't know how
you can live with yourself

1086
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:27,684
if you let something happen to a child.

1087
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:33,481
[Norelli] I'm sorry,
but your family is dead.

[Anna] You're gonna ski in those tomorrow.

1094
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:52,500
That one looks like a horse.

1095
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:54,460
What would you name a horse if we got one?

1096
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:56,337
I'd call him Vixen.

1097
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,131
A vixen is a fox.

1098
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,634
It's a girl fox, sweetheart.

1099
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:04,971
[Olivia] What would you call
a horse, Mommy?

1100
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,556
"Of course, of course."

1101
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,439
It's an old TV show.

1102
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:20,403
I can't do it this way.

1103
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:21,987

This.

1107
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,792
This happy family vacation.

1108
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:39,046
You and I spoke in painful detail

1109
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:42,925
and I thought that we agreed
that we would not ruin Christmas.

1110
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:46,929
And I can't do it anymore. I can't.

1111
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:50,308
The acting is foolish.

1112
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:52,143
It doesn't dignify our daughter.

1113
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,813
You don't care if she gets upset?

1114
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:58,941
She should be upset. It's upsetting.

1115
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:04,952
Well, don't blame me
if she's scarred for life.

1116
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:07,825
I do blame you.

1117

You're to blame.

[Little]
I talked to your doctor, Dr. Landy.

1155
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:21,978
And you have had a hell of a time.

1156
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:26,440
And I think you actually believe
that you met this lady

1157
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:28,943
just like how you believe
you're talking to your family.

1158
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:34,240
Your doctor said that your meds
can cause hallucinations.

1159

Maybe that's okay by you.

1160

- Um…

And there's some mania, too.

1196
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:12,273
I just really needed to be
at the center of something.

this could've gone differently.

- No, no.

He's…

1205
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:47,266
Gonna come back this afternoon and…

01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:50,144
Pick up the last of his stuff.

There's gonna have to be somebody here.

to three sessions a week.

<i>Uh, today is, um…</i>

1219
01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:11,702
<i>Monday. November 6th.</i>

1220
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:14,872
<i>And I'm making this video…</i>

1221
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:16,540
[whispers] <i>Making…</i>

1222
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:18,334
[camera beeps]

1223
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:21,128
<i>I'm Anna Fox, and I'm at 104…</i>

1224
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:25,382
<i>West 121st Street in Manhattan, New York.</i>

1225
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,595
<i>And I am, uh, making this video…</i>

1226
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:32,514
<i>As my final will and testament.</i>

1227
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:37,353
Randy Turo, that's a lawyer.

1228
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:39,104
He has a written will…

1229
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:42,149
That Ed and I did together.

1230
01:12:43,817 --> 01:12:45,027
After, um…

1231
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:48,030
Olivia was born.

1232
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:51,283
And I'm not gonna be…

1233
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:54,286
Making any, like,
super-significant changes…

1234
01:12:54,828 --> 01:12:55,746
[laughs]

1235
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:57,706
Super… Super…

1236
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,416
- Fuck, really?
- [camera beeps]

1237
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:04,505
<i>The point of me doing this
is that there's no, um…</i>

1238
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:07,091
<i>Confusion…</i>

1239
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:09,593
<i>About, um,</i>

1240
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:11,553
my soundness of mind.

1241
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:17,643
My state of mind.

1242
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:20,896
<i>I... I...
I especially wanna make sure that, um…</i>

1243
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:23,649
<i>That you know that David Winters</i>

1244
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:26,944
<i>has absolutely
nothing to do with my death.</i>

1245
01:13:27,027 --> 01:13:28,904
<i>In fact, I'm waiting for him to come…</i>

1246
01:13:31,031 --> 01:13:32,991
<i>To come and to get his stuff…</i>

1247
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:35,202
<i>So that I can, um…</i>

1248
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:40,958
Go through with it.

1249
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:56,181
Go through with it… [scoffs]

1250
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:00,310
<i>I just wish I could be forgiven.</i>

1251
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:06,859
<i>I really…</i>

1252
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:10,237
<i>Wish I could just be forgiven.</i>

1253
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:16,243
<i>I want to go back.</i>

1254
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:20,581
<i>I want to do it over.</i>

1255
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:25,919
<i>I want to do it different.</i>

1256
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:33,009
<i>And I can't.</i>

1257
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:38,140
<i>And I can't.</i>

1258
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:41,810
[tense music slowly builds]

1259
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:45,731
[shouts] I can't!

1260
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:50,694
[suspenseful music playing]

1261
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:13,675

1269
01:15:43,747 --> 01:15:44,748
[whispering] Okay.

1270
01:15:46,124 --> 01:15:47,124
[muffled thud]

1271
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:49,086
Hello?

1272
01:15:49,169 --> 01:15:50,546
[rain pattering]

1273
01:15:59,763 --> 01:16:00,889
Hello?

1274
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:03,099
[David] Sorry.

1275
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:07,062
Tried to call. I just need to get
my umbrella and my gloves.

1276
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:08,480
[Anna] Can you come up?

1277
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,982
Uh, just for a moment.

1278
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:11,275
[David] I'm soaking wet.

1279
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:13,238
I had a long day
and it's not about to end soon.

1280
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:15,362
[Anna] Please. It'll just take a minute.

1281
01:16:15,445 --> 01:16:17,447
[footsteps walking up stairs]

1282
01:16:27,874 --> 01:16:28,874
[Anna gasps]

1283
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:31,211
Thank you.

1284
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:32,296
For what?

1285
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,214
[chuckles softly]

1286
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:38,552
I wanna show you…

1287
01:16:38,635 --> 01:16:39,635
A picture.

1288
01:16:44,808 --> 01:16:45,976
[David sighs]

1289
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:54,693
The face in the wine glass.

1290
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:57,779
Yeah, I see it.

1291
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:00,907
[chuckles softly]

1292
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:02,909
That is the woman that I saw murdered.

1293
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:05,078
She said that her name was Jane Russell!

1294
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:12,669
Her name is Katie.

1295
01:17:13,253 --> 01:17:14,630
[tense music plays]

1296
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:15,713
What?

1297
01:17:16,506 --> 01:17:18,008
Ethan, the son…

1298
01:17:18,925 --> 01:17:20,135
She is the birth mother.

1299
01:17:23,096 --> 01:17:24,556
You spent the night with her.

1300
01:17:25,098 --> 01:17:26,725
Wednesday. One night.

1301
01:17:27,267 --> 01:17:29,853
She was a total disaster.
Why do you think I bailed?

1302
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:33,106
I spent the night on a couch in Astoria
on Thursday night

1303
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:34,870
just so I don't have
to run into her again.

1304
01:17:35,525 --> 01:17:38,153
She ran away on him
when she was eight months pregnant.

1305
01:17:38,236 --> 01:17:40,822
Disappeared.
Alistair spent two years chasing her down…

1306
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,586
And found her in some Oregon meth commune.

1307
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,660
He took the boy, she went to prison.

1308
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:46,912
- See how I changed the subject on you?
- I did.

1309
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:49,456
You don't know who you're fooling with.
[laughing]

1310
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:53,627
They told you this?

1311
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:56,129
She did. She wouldn't shut up.

1312
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:59,675
They've been hiding from her for years.
She found out they were living in Boston.

1313
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:01,385
He's been paying her to stay away.

1314
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:04,471
Why did she tell me
her name is Jane Russell?

1315
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:05,597
You're Jane Russell.

1316
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:06,723
You're Jane Russell.

1317
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:08,892
What makes you say that?

1318
01:18:08,975 --> 01:18:11,478
[Anna] Your son came by. Ethan.

1319
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:14,898
<i>I saw her murdered.</i>

1320
01:18:16,274 --> 01:18:17,776
[thunder rumbles]

1321
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:19,611
Whatever you say, Anna.

1322
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:20,695
Yeah.

1323
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:24,616
I showed you… the picture.

1324
01:18:25,617 --> 01:18:28,036
Yeah, looking very much alive.

1325
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,329
She's real.

1326
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,834
And I need you
to go to the police with me.

1327
01:18:34,334 --> 01:18:35,627
[sighs]

1328
01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:39,297
No.

1329
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:40,590
No, no.

1330
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:41,674
David!

1331
01:18:42,342 --> 01:18:44,553
You can't just run away from this!

1332
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:46,430
[David] Watch me.

1333
01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:48,223
Oh, shit! Please, David!

1334
01:18:49,474 --> 01:18:50,892
- [glass shatters]
- Oh, shit!

1335
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:53,145
[gasps]

1336
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:56,314
- [objects clattering]
- [David grunts]

1337
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:58,400
[creaking]

1338
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:06,450
[breathing shakily]

1339
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:09,285
David?

1340
01:19:10,662 --> 01:19:11,788
[faint creaking]

1341
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:16,752
[breathing shakily]

1342
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:23,842
[rain pattering]

1343
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:30,223
[creaking]

1344
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:31,308
- [loud snap]
- [gasps]

1345
01:19:32,642 --> 01:19:34,519
- [loud sneeze]
- [Anna screams]

1346
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:35,645
Oh, my God!

1347
01:19:36,563 --> 01:19:38,398
You know what's so great about this?

1348
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:41,735
Everyone thinks
I'm in New Hampshire right now.

1349
01:19:41,818 --> 01:19:45,113
They call it a wilderness program
but it's really a prison.

1350
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:47,407
I was supposed to go last month

1351
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:49,993
but they had a fire or something.
[chuckles softly]

1352
01:19:52,662 --> 01:19:54,915
We never had a chance to say goodbye.

1353
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:56,666
David!

1354
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:59,961
The trick is to run away
before you get there.

1355
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:01,713
What did you do? [loudly] David!

1356
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:02,839
He's dead.

1357
01:20:03,673 --> 01:20:04,674
You killed him.

1358
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:06,927
- No. What?
- It's your knife.

1359
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:10,597
Your house. Just the two of you.

1360
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,849
What did you do?

1361
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:14,351
He deserved it.

1362
01:20:14,434 --> 01:20:17,229
He slept with my mom
and got her all pissed off.

1363
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:18,563
And then threw her out.

1364
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:20,023
[Anna whimpering]

1365
01:20:20,106 --> 01:20:22,901
She might have just gone away
if he'd left her alone.

1366
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:25,821
Then maybe none of this
would have happened.

1367
01:20:27,447 --> 01:20:29,324
- Don't scream, Anna.
- [gasps]

1368
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,993
That'll just be bad for everyone.

1369
01:20:32,702 --> 01:20:34,204
[shuddering]

1370
01:20:34,287 --> 01:20:36,289
[breathes deeply]

1371
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:37,373
Take a deep breath.

1372
01:20:37,415 --> 01:20:38,959
[gasping]

1373
01:20:39,042 --> 01:20:41,002
That's what they're always
telling me to do.

1374
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:43,046
Self-management coping skills.

1375
01:20:43,129 --> 01:20:44,881
[thunder rumbling]

1376
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:46,633
- [breathing shakily]
- [breathes deeply]

1377
01:20:46,716 --> 01:20:48,301
Good. We can breathe together.

1378
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:51,221
[breathes deeply]

1379
01:20:51,304 --> 01:20:52,764
[shuddering]

1380
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:57,185
- Why are you so freaked out?
- [shuddering]

1381
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:58,937
You're killing yourself anyway, right?

1382
01:21:00,897 --> 01:21:02,774
[tense music playing]

1383
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:04,317
No. No.

1384
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:09,030
I thought it was a really nice video.

1385
01:21:11,074 --> 01:21:13,034
How did you get into my house?

1386
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:17,122
'Cause you're so vigilant about your keys.

1387
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:19,332
And sober. Right.

1388
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:23,003
I've been in here all week.

1389
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:25,672
You killed your mother.

1390
01:21:32,178 --> 01:21:33,930
That bothers you, right?

1391
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:36,641
You feel for her?

1392
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:39,561
You and Katie…

1393
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:42,230
One job to do.

1394
01:21:43,523 --> 01:21:45,692
One fucking thing.

1395
01:21:48,236 --> 01:21:50,280
Take care of your family, right?

1396
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:52,616
Both of you.

1397
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:55,118
And what do you do?

1398
01:21:56,828 --> 01:21:59,831
The real estate lady
who sold my dad the house,

1399
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:03,209
she talked about you and what happened.

1400
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:05,921
And I couldn't stop thinking

1401
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:09,174
what a perfect next person
you were for me.

1402
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:12,844
I knew exactly what you would like.

1403
01:22:14,888 --> 01:22:17,098
Is that a talent or a skill…

1404
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:18,850
To know that…

1405
01:22:20,727 --> 01:22:22,562
In your professional opinion?

1406
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:28,318
Okay, see? Now you don't like me anymore.

1407
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:31,321
Is that what happened in Boston…

1408
01:22:32,405 --> 01:22:34,658
With you and Pam? She got sick of you?

1409
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:38,411
Pam liked everything I did.

1410
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:40,705
You don't seem very sure about it.

1411
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:42,791
She was just a place to start.

1412
01:22:43,708 --> 01:22:45,001
I'm still figuring things out.

1413
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:47,545
- What does that mean?
- I don't have a pattern yet.

1414
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:49,464
- Pattern of?
- Of this!

1415
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,217
I have so many choices, right?

1416
01:22:53,843 --> 01:22:56,137
What do I wanna be when I grow up?

1417
01:22:57,681 --> 01:23:00,642
I know I like being there
when it happens, feeling it.

1418
01:23:04,854 --> 01:23:07,857
Pam took about five minutes to die
after she hit the ground.

1419
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:12,404
If you hadn't found that picture of Katie,

1420
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:15,073
I was just gonna come in at the very end

1421
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:16,324
and say goodbye.

1422
01:23:17,867 --> 01:23:19,953
You could pretend that I'm not even here.

1423
01:23:22,288 --> 01:23:25,041
[breathes heavily]

1424
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:27,085
I just wanna watch you go.

1425
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:31,715
Okay.

1426
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:36,094
You know what, fuck it.

1427
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:38,471
You wanna watch?

1428
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:42,892
[tense music playing]

1429
01:23:48,314 --> 01:23:51,067
Because a world with you in it…

1430
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:54,154
Where you exist…

1431
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:56,948
Is a world of filth.

1432
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:03,538
No, I'm done.

1433
01:24:03,621 --> 01:24:07,250
[tense music rising]

1434
01:24:07,333 --> 01:24:09,169
[Ethan breathing heavily]

1435
01:24:14,507 --> 01:24:16,676
I don't wanna breathe that air.

1436
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:21,264
[Ethan screaming]

1437
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:23,183

[panting and wincing]

1461
01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:35,505
Anna!

1462
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:39,717
Stop fighting me!

1463
01:25:40,844 --> 01:25:42,137
[gasping]

[frantic, chilling music playing]

1474
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:32,562
- [gasps]
- You don't even wanna live anymore!

1475
01:26:32,645 --> 01:26:35,523
You haven't wanted to live
for a long time!

1476
01:26:36,107 --> 01:26:37,233
[gasping]

1477

1478
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:47,702
Here we go!

1479
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:50,537
[Anna] No!

1480
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:53,041

[morose music playing]

1489
01:28:12,203 --> 01:28:13,203
[Little] Hey.

1490
01:28:15,164 --> 01:28:17,083
Hey, I was just gonna leave a message.

1491
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:22,380
Were you here before?

1492
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:24,215
[Little] Yeah. And they, um…

1493
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:26,301
They told me not to wake you, so…

1494
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:28,969
Are you in pain?

1495
01:28:30,638 --> 01:28:31,806
I should be, right?

1496
01:28:31,889 --> 01:28:35,893
Hey, just don't stay on that shit too long
'cause it feels way too good.

1497
01:28:38,771 --> 01:28:40,106
David's dead?

1498
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:42,941
Yeah.

1499
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:45,820
I'm sorry.

1500
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:49,657
But, uh, we have the Russells in custody.

1501
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:54,329
He isn't sayin' a word, but Jane,
she won't stop talking, so… [scoffs]

1502
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:58,624
We have Katherine Melli's body.

1503
01:28:58,708 --> 01:29:00,626
We found it in Fort Lee.

1504
01:29:02,545 --> 01:29:04,422
Means you were right
about everything you saw.

1505
01:29:05,298 --> 01:29:08,426
And we messed up, and you're gonna get
a lot of apologies from a lot of people.

1506
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:11,304
And I just wanted
to be here to be the first.

1507
01:29:13,473 --> 01:29:14,473
I'm sorry.

1508
01:29:16,059 --> 01:29:17,059
Thank you.

1509
01:29:23,232 --> 01:29:24,567
I saw your video.

1510
01:29:32,742 --> 01:29:35,453
So, look, um, Detective Norelli,

1511
01:29:35,995 --> 01:29:38,414
I hope you don't mind,
she's got Punch at her house.

1512
01:29:38,498 --> 01:29:42,210
Whenever you're ready to get out of here,
she's happy to give her back...

1513
01:29:42,293 --> 01:29:44,128
So, everybody's seen the video?

1514
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:48,840
At this point…

1515
01:29:50,843 --> 01:29:51,843
No.

1516
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:55,223
No, no, no. Um…

1517
01:29:56,182 --> 01:29:59,394
We're actually having a little trouble
locating the phone.

1518
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:04,357
Yeah, I think that somehow
the phone ended up here with you,

1519
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:07,985
and when I come back
and ask you about it in an hour…

1520
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:11,406
You hand it over.

1521
01:30:14,033 --> 01:30:16,536
Get rid of anything on there
that you don't want out, okay?

1522
01:30:19,372 --> 01:30:20,372
Really?

1523
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:26,129
Look, I messed up this case
so bad already.

1524
01:30:26,212 --> 01:30:28,339
I don't think one more thing
is gonna hurt me, right?

1525
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:30,341
[Little chuckles softly]

1526
01:30:37,807 --> 01:30:39,308
Just be straight up with me.

1527
01:30:44,147 --> 01:30:46,232
I'm not gonna have
to worry about you, right?

1528
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:50,945
[soft, cordial music playing]

1529
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:55,282
Right.

[sighs]

1537
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:11,609
I miss you.

1538
01:32:52,066 --> 01:32:53,401
You ready?

1539
01:32:53,484 --> 01:32:55,486
Huh? Hmm?

1540
01:32:57,530 --> 01:32:59,198
- [meows]
- All right.

1541
01:33:00,157 --> 01:33:01,784
Okay, it won't be long.

1542
01:33:01,867 --> 01:33:05,538
- Come on, come on. Come.
- [purrs]

1543
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:08,456
