it won't happen again. Ever.

I hired you to put the drama in

What's the prob?

The problem
Barry is that I can't

have my guys on set doing drugs.

you this in film school.

00:28:56,806 --> 00:28:59,110
I know I went crazy
and if I were you

528
00:28:59,143 --> 00:29:01,382
I would have broken
up with me too.

529
00:29:02,884 --> 00:29:04,288
But I've changed.

530
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:09,197
Nice to see that you met orange
mocha frappuccino over there.

531
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,038
It's only gonna get worse trust
me.

532
00:29:13,906 --> 00:29:16,812
Well it's not so bad right now.

533
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:20,487
Maybe we could hangout later?

534
00:29:21,087 --> 00:29:23,258
I have some half moon we
could...

535
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:26,665
I gotta call my girlfriend,
we're living together now.

536
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:29,170
Look, good luck with all this.

537
00:29:29,972 --> 00:29:31,976
It was really good seeing you.

538
00:29:32,677 --> 00:29:34,314
I'll see you around ok?

539
00:29:36,051 --> 00:29:37,421
[light pop music]

540
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,739
See you later.

541
00:29:49,945 --> 00:29:51,582
[upbeat rhythmic music]

542
00:29:54,522 --> 00:29:56,459
Alright guys quiet down, settle,
settle, settle.

543
00:29:56,492 --> 00:29:58,295
We're gonna go for a take,
we are going

544
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,299
to go for a take.
Settle down please.

545
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:02,604
Quiet on set please, quiet on
set. Sam, you set?

546
00:30:03,873 --> 00:30:05,677
Welcoming dinner, take one.

547
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,213
And... Action!

548
00:30:08,215 --> 00:30:11,489
Ok, ladies.
Here's your vegan, vegetarian,

549
00:30:11,523 --> 00:30:15,463
paleo, peanut free,
gluten free, welcome dinner.

550
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,942
A toast to my beautiful women

551
00:30:21,976 --> 00:30:25,115
and the next
American Dream star.

552
00:30:25,551 --> 00:30:27,588
To our producer, thank you for

553
00:30:27,622 --> 00:30:29,626
making this
opportunity possible.

554
00:30:30,225 --> 00:30:32,731
[Barry and ladies]
Cheers, cheers, cheers, cheers.

555
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,778
Margaret.

556
00:30:51,503 --> 00:30:52,136
Wow.

557
00:30:53,004 --> 00:30:55,008
Alright, this tastes amazing.

558
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:59,985
My compliments to the chef.
You know nothing would ever beat

559
00:31:00,018 --> 00:31:03,291
my grandmother's home cooking
but this... it's a close second.

560
00:31:03,926 --> 00:31:04,761
[Sam]
Cut!

561
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:08,736
Crystal, honey.
You can't say that your

562
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:11,442
grandmother's cooking is
better than our master chef.

563
00:31:12,142 --> 00:31:15,584
Let's do it again and this time
take a taste and say...

564
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,255
nothing ever beat
my grandmother's

565
00:31:18,288 --> 00:31:20,025
cooking but yours just did.

566
00:31:21,027 --> 00:31:22,665
But that's not true.

567
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:26,772
My grandma just
died and my family

568
00:31:26,805 --> 00:31:29,444
will be watching this too,
I can't...

569
00:31:30,045 --> 00:31:31,683
Crystal, listen honey...

570
00:31:33,051 --> 00:31:37,192
no one gives a rat's ass about
your grandma. So just...

571
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:41,301
Quote the lines or you're off
the show.

572
00:31:42,102 --> 00:31:43,305
Settle please.

573
00:31:44,474 --> 00:31:46,478
Alright, rolling.

574
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:49,283
[man]
Alright guys let's go for

575
00:31:49,317 --> 00:31:50,285
another one.

576
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:52,457
Welcome dinner, pickup on
Crystal.

577
00:31:52,692 --> 00:31:53,694
[Sam]
Action.

578
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,649
Wow.

579
00:32:06,653 --> 00:32:08,254
This tastes amazing.

580
00:32:08,623 --> 00:32:10,460
My compliments to the chef.

581
00:32:13,466 --> 00:32:16,337
Nothing ever beat my grandma's
home cooking.

582
00:32:17,072 --> 00:32:17,708
But...

583
00:32:21,716 --> 00:32:24,387
I'm sorry, I can't, I can't lie.

584
00:32:25,021 --> 00:32:26,826
If I'm out then I'm out.

585
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,561
[Sam]
Cut!

586
00:32:27,595 --> 00:32:29,565
What the bloody hell was that!

587
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:30,601
I can't lie.

588
00:32:32,236 --> 00:32:33,271
You can't lie.

589
00:32:34,373 --> 00:32:35,511
You can't lie.

590
00:32:36,513 --> 00:32:38,517
This is a bloody reality show.

591
00:32:39,918 --> 00:32:41,120
You have to lie.

592
00:32:41,989 --> 00:32:43,727
It's called acting honey.

593
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,862
[ladies laugh]

594
00:32:46,766 --> 00:32:48,837
Well I call being
disrespectful to my family

595
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,874
and my grandma's
memory something else.

596
00:32:52,878 --> 00:32:55,617
So... if I'm out then I'm out.

597
00:32:56,753 --> 00:32:59,023
So much the better,
she certainly wouldn't have

598
00:32:59,056 --> 00:33:01,629
won the competition with
her lack of acting skills.

599
00:33:02,631 --> 00:33:04,569
Survival of the fittest baby.

600
00:33:05,268 --> 00:33:07,775
Crystal,
Sam didn't mean that, you're

601
00:33:07,808 --> 00:33:10,412
not out just...
don't do it again. Ok?

602
00:33:14,153 --> 00:33:15,222
[Sam]
Action.

603
00:33:16,626 --> 00:33:20,868
You know this is really
delicious. If I win this

604
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:25,777
competition I'm gonna have
you be my personal chef.

605
00:33:26,077 --> 00:33:28,281
Well that's already where you
lost.

606
00:33:29,283 --> 00:33:31,556
"If I win" is a
statement submitting

607
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:33,324
yourself to a higher power.

608
00:33:33,793 --> 00:33:36,766
I always say "when I win",
you know it opens the

609
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,972
universal energies and
manifests that vision of me.

610
00:33:41,173 --> 00:33:42,578
Owning my power.

611
00:33:43,244 --> 00:33:45,851
When I win instead of if I win?

612
00:33:46,586 --> 00:33:47,185
[Amy]
Yea.

613
00:33:47,888 --> 00:33:49,559
My life coach always taught me

614
00:33:49,592 --> 00:33:51,796
it's always about
positive energy.

615
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:54,400
Please!
So you're saying that anyone

616
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:57,072
with absolutely
no talent could win

617
00:33:57,105 --> 00:33:59,779
this competition
just from saying

618
00:33:59,812 --> 00:34:02,551
"when I win"
instead of "if I win".

619
00:34:02,585 --> 00:34:05,322
Yea but there's more to it than
just that.

620
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:07,661
[blonde]
Seriously, you guys are so

621
00:34:07,695 --> 00:34:09,196
caught up in yourselves.

622
00:34:09,865 --> 00:34:12,469
It's not about what
you think or what you

623
00:34:12,503 --> 00:34:15,375
say. It's about what you
do and who you know.

624
00:34:16,613 --> 00:34:18,817
You are very competitive women,
many

625
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:21,521
think a gain must
come at someone's loss.

626
00:34:21,956 --> 00:34:25,228
If this is the prism which
through you see the world you

627
00:34:25,261 --> 00:34:28,970
must be prepared to deal with
the stress of the competition.

628
00:34:29,605 --> 00:34:31,340
Or you'll choke.

629
00:34:32,476 --> 00:34:34,480
Fall victim of your own nerves.

630
00:34:36,986 --> 00:34:38,354
I hope you choke.

631
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,026
[eery sounds]

632
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:46,237
[ethereal whispering]

633
00:34:48,743 --> 00:34:50,112
[Mocha]
Hey! What do you

634
00:34:50,146 --> 00:34:51,148
think you're doing!

635
00:34:52,416 --> 00:34:54,253
Give me that camera! You're not
supposed to take picture of us.

636
00:34:55,221 --> 00:34:55,991
Why not?

637
00:34:57,126 --> 00:35:00,967
Close in on Mocha and come in
here close on Amy, ok?

638
00:35:01,001 --> 00:35:03,640
[Mocha]
Because I'm a professional model

639
00:35:03,673 --> 00:35:05,677
and my pictures are valuable.

640
00:35:06,243 --> 00:35:08,481
You're taking something
personal without

641
00:35:08,515 --> 00:35:11,353
our permission and
it's really rude of you.

642
00:35:11,387 --> 00:35:13,357
You shouldn't be allowed to do
so.

643
00:35:13,391 --> 00:35:15,228
Alright,
ladies you all signed releases

644
00:35:15,261 --> 00:35:17,432
saying that we can
photograph and film you.

645
00:35:18,068 --> 00:35:20,039
I will see to it
personally that all

646
00:35:20,072 --> 00:35:22,043
those photos are on the show,
alright?

647
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:23,913
So we don't have any
right to say no?

648
00:35:23,947 --> 00:35:25,851
Not after you sign the
contract girlfriend.

649
00:35:28,055 --> 00:35:30,126
[Sam]
Cut, cut, Chloe that was great

650
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,393
but why'd you stop?

651
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:34,399
I want you to go over to Byron,
yell at him and then

652
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:37,875
throw water in his face and
then start in on Amy again. Ok?

653
00:35:37,908 --> 00:35:40,881
You know this is not
a competition of skill

654
00:35:40,914 --> 00:35:44,554
this is about exploiting.
There's no honor here.

655
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:47,961
This is bullshit. You know I'm
leaving.

656
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:52,771
Hey young lady I've
worked all day preparing

657
00:35:52,805 --> 00:35:55,176
this meal for you and
now you've ruined it.

658
00:35:55,209 --> 00:35:56,310
Just shut up.

659
00:35:57,547 --> 00:36:02,023
You'll eat your words and don't
worry they're gluten free.

660
00:36:02,056 --> 00:36:05,029
Hey calm down, you're gonna have
a heart attack.

661
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:07,734
Amy, may I please have the
camera?

662
00:36:10,573 --> 00:36:11,241
Trust me.

663
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:15,216
- Just for my vision board.
- Cool.

664
00:36:16,251 --> 00:36:17,119
Meditation.

665
00:36:18,322 --> 00:36:20,827
[Barry]
Sam! This show's going to shit

666
00:36:21,328 --> 00:36:21,996
let's go.

667
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:25,336
[ladies chattering]

668
00:36:31,514 --> 00:36:32,751
[ominous music]

669
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:41,903
[disconcerting music]

670
00:37:20,012 --> 00:37:23,018
Prism in what you view the
world.

671
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,024
Blah, blah, blah.

672
00:37:26,524 --> 00:37:29,030
Better get ready for the
competition.

673
00:37:29,898 --> 00:37:33,538
I'll show those girls who's in
control of the competition.

674
00:37:36,077 --> 00:37:37,413
[dramatic, ominous music]

675
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:21,836
[unsettling sounds, ethereal
whispering]

676
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,617
Um hi.

677
00:38:46,384 --> 00:38:48,488
Amy, hi, I...

678
00:38:50,894 --> 00:38:52,864
I wanted to see if you're ok.

679
00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:56,004
Everyone ganged up on you and...

680
00:38:56,037 --> 00:38:59,243
Ok, look I'm in the middle of
something. Can this just wait?

681
00:38:59,611 --> 00:39:01,916
Yea, sure I just wanted to say.

682
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,793
I'm here if you need a friend.
Something doesn't feel right.

683
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,969
Like I was even praying in my
room earlier and...

684
00:39:12,002 --> 00:39:13,506
Oh ok, you're a...

685
00:39:14,508 --> 00:39:17,514
you're one of those people, yea
that's right.

686
00:39:17,914 --> 00:39:18,883
One of what?

687
00:39:18,916 --> 00:39:20,520
Hashtag Jesus freak.

688
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:23,858
We have an early day tomorrow.

689
00:39:23,893 --> 00:39:26,264
Amy, I'm just a normal person...

690
00:39:27,433 --> 00:39:29,870
who happens to be a big fan of
Jesus too.

691
00:39:29,905 --> 00:39:33,278
Yea, well I find religion too
confining. I need my freedom.

692
00:39:33,946 --> 00:39:35,048
Your locket.

693
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:36,784
[ethereal whispering]

694
00:39:37,152 --> 00:39:39,591
I've seen that crest somewhere
before.

695
00:39:40,158 --> 00:39:41,695
Yea, it was a gift.

696
00:39:43,331 --> 00:39:45,035
[disconcerting music]

697
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,913
Let's just quit,
I can call my boyfriend

698
00:39:50,947 --> 00:39:52,416
and he can meet
us on the street.

699
00:39:52,449 --> 00:39:53,418
- Quit, really?
- Yes.

700
00:39:53,451 --> 00:39:54,053
Wow.

701
00:39:56,925 --> 00:39:59,931
I've heard of people freaking

1577
01:30:01,532 --> 01:30:02,400
[Amy]
Come in I have

1578
01:30:02,433 --> 01:30:03,402
something to tell you.

1579
01:30:03,435 --> 01:30:04,470
[Crystal]
I have

1580
01:30:04,505 --> 01:30:06,174
something to tell you too.
Listen I almost left.

1581
01:30:06,207 --> 01:30:08,946
Crystal, please just shut up ok?
I have to show you something.

1582
01:30:09,548 --> 01:30:11,184
I think I'm the murderer.

1583
01:30:11,686 --> 01:30:14,525
The reason that Byron
wasn't here today is because

1584
01:30:14,558 --> 01:30:17,330
he was with me last night
and when we woke up...

1585
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:19,834
his heart was on this
pillow but he was gone but

1586
01:30:19,867 --> 01:30:21,806
his heart was there
and it was still beating.

1587
01:30:21,838 --> 01:30:23,175
Amy, Amy, there's nothing there.

1588
01:30:23,208 --> 01:30:25,045
You're not a the murderer,
I know you're not.

1589
01:30:25,079 --> 01:30:27,718
Really, really? Then how do you
explain this?

1590
01:30:28,085 --> 01:30:29,688
How do you explain this!

1591
01:30:29,722 --> 01:30:32,493
No, you just can't be the
murderer. You just can't!

1592
01:30:33,629 --> 01:30:36,969
But the murders have something
to do with this board.

1593
01:30:38,472 --> 01:30:41,579
This parts in Latin. I teach
Latin in my class.

1594
01:30:42,079 --> 01:30:43,348
[ominous music]

1595
01:30:44,217 --> 01:30:46,856
Amy, do you know what this
mantra says?

1596
01:30:47,858 --> 01:30:49,327
It says I offer
myself and these six

1597
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,498
sacrifices to you.
Have you been saying this?

1598
01:30:51,532 --> 01:30:52,701
I thought it was a
positive statement

1599
01:30:52,734 --> 01:30:54,070
just to put out
into the universe.

1600
01:30:54,103 --> 01:30:55,139
Oh yea well they're out there

1601
01:30:55,172 --> 01:30:56,207
alright,
you do realize that this is

1602
01:30:56,241 --> 01:30:58,378
witchcraft?
And offering sacrifices,

1603
01:30:58,412 --> 01:30:59,982
where did you get all this?

1604
01:31:00,015 --> 01:31:03,155
From my life coach Liz but she
just puts harmless forces out of

1605
01:31:03,188 --> 01:31:05,459
nature and just
positive energies

1606
01:31:05,492 --> 01:31:07,229
and that's it,
it's all harmless.

1607
01:31:07,597 --> 01:31:10,369
Yea well a lot of dead people.
Ok...

1608
01:31:11,004 --> 01:31:14,343
Liz what? What's her name? Does
she have like a website?

1609
01:31:14,377 --> 01:31:17,349
It's: I see for you
life coaching dot-com

1610
01:31:17,383 --> 01:31:19,020
Alright, let's look this up.

1611
01:31:26,434 --> 01:31:28,739
You have the same
locket and I looked up what

1612
01:31:28,773 --> 01:31:31,110
that symbol means,
did she give it to you?

1613
01:31:31,144 --> 01:31:32,747
[Amy]
Yea, it was a gift.

1614
01:31:32,781 --> 01:31:33,950
[Crystal]
It's a family crest

1615
01:31:33,982 --> 01:31:36,522
mixed with a satanic symbol.
It actually belonged to the

1616
01:31:36,555 --> 01:31:39,160
Williams family back in the
1600's. Here I'll show you.

1617
01:31:39,695 --> 01:31:41,030
[intrigue music]

1618
01:31:41,799 --> 01:31:43,870
In 1692 in Salem,
Abigail Williams

1619
01:31:43,903 --> 01:31:45,874
was the first
accused witch to be

1620
01:31:45,907 --> 01:31:47,677
burned at the stake for having

1621
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:49,882
sacrificed 6 young
women to the devil so

1622
01:31:49,915 --> 01:31:52,086
that she could possess
his demonic powers.

1623
01:31:52,453 --> 01:31:55,894
Her niece Bridget turned her in
to stop the murders.

1624
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:57,162
[people yelling]

1625
01:31:57,463 --> 01:31:58,633
[man]
Burn her!

1626
01:31:58,666 --> 01:31:59,935
[man]
You're gonna burn in hell!

1627
01:31:59,968 --> 01:32:02,139
[Abigail]
You're no family to me.

1628
01:32:02,172 --> 01:32:05,345
How could you be my accuser? How
could you betray me?

1629
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:09,855
I had to stop the killings. I
curse you and your descendents.

1630
01:32:10,422 --> 01:32:12,627
You were killing innocent
people.

1631
01:32:12,661 --> 01:32:14,798
I could have given
you everything,

1632
01:32:14,831 --> 01:32:16,735
we could have had everything.

1633
01:32:17,737 --> 01:32:19,407
[Crystal]
Her niece Bridget

1634
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:22,046
turned her in to stop the
murders. It is said that as she

1635
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:24,551
was burning at the stake,
before she died... Abigail tried

1636
01:32:24,585 --> 01:32:27,089
to cast a spell on her niece
and her sister's descendents

1637
01:32:27,122 --> 01:32:29,628
to carry her spirit and the
demon she had inside of her.

1638
01:32:29,962 --> 01:32:35,005
Burn her! Burn her! Burn that
witch! Burn her!

1639
01:32:35,339 --> 01:32:36,642
[people yelling]

1640
01:32:37,009 --> 01:32:39,480
[man]
Joseph, it's time.

1641
01:32:42,219 --> 01:32:43,121
[Bridget]
No.

1642
01:32:44,091 --> 01:32:45,994
Curse you and your bloodline.

1643
01:32:47,597 --> 01:32:50,103
I send my demon upon you.

1644
01:32:50,970 --> 01:32:54,111
He will live in you and your
children's children.

1645
01:32:54,645 --> 01:32:58,519
[Speaking Latin]

1646
01:33:01,224 --> 01:33:02,727
[Abigail screaming]

1647
01:33:03,863 --> 01:33:06,969
You and your family
keep your eyes on Jesus,

1648
01:33:07,002 --> 01:33:09,841
you will be safe.
And, your children's

1649
01:33:09,875 --> 01:33:12,881
children must to all
they can to resist the

1650
01:33:12,914 --> 01:33:16,555
temptations of the
demonic forces of witchcraft.

1651
01:33:16,855 --> 01:33:20,129
[screaming]

1652
01:33:21,131 --> 01:33:23,301
[man]
Burn in Hell you evil witch.

1653
01:33:34,658 --> 01:33:37,029
There was a priest there who
intervened, defended Bridget

1654
01:33:37,062 --> 01:33:39,433
and prayed for God to
protect her and her descendents.

1655
01:33:39,935 --> 01:33:41,270
[dramatic music]

1656
01:33:42,707 --> 01:33:45,245
That's the same priest I spoke
with last night.

1657
01:33:45,278 --> 01:33:47,650
What priest? When did you talk
to a priest?

1658
01:33:47,684 --> 01:33:49,821
All descendents in the
Williams family line are

1659
01:33:49,855 --> 01:33:52,292
said to still carry the
birthmark from the curse.

1660
01:33:54,931 --> 01:33:58,539
Amy, you're a descendent. You
have the birth mark.

1661
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:02,146
After Abigail died her ashes
were kept in a sacred vault

1662
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:05,018
by a coven of witches who became
Abigail's followers determined

1663
01:34:05,051 --> 01:34:07,791
to bring the demon back through
the William's family line.

1664
01:34:08,225 --> 01:34:10,395
It's said that they wore
Abigail's ashes inside

1665
01:34:10,428 --> 01:34:12,399
lockets.
The lockets have small shards of

1666
01:34:12,432 --> 01:34:14,571
mirror on them indicating
that Abigail's spirit

1667
01:34:14,604 --> 01:34:16,909
could be scried through
reflective surfaces.

1668
01:34:16,942 --> 01:34:18,311
[eery whispering]

1669
01:34:18,979 --> 01:34:20,917
Amy,
your life coach Liz is a part of

1670
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:22,352
that coven.

1671
01:34:22,386 --> 01:34:24,558
She's a follower of that
cult and she is the murderer

1672
01:34:24,591 --> 01:34:26,695
and has been using
witchcraft and demonic forces.

1673
01:34:26,962 --> 01:34:28,431
[eery tense music]

1674
01:34:29,568 --> 01:34:31,538
Those are not Crystal's in your

1675
01:34:31,572 --> 01:34:34,211
necklace,
those are ashes from the witch.

1676
01:34:34,811 --> 01:34:38,252
Amy, this isn't you. You have to
put that down.

1677
01:34:39,321 --> 01:34:39,955
Amy!

1678
01:34:41,457 --> 01:34:44,764
Amy, take of the necklace. That
thing is controlling you.

1679
01:34:46,835 --> 01:34:50,743
You're gonna have to wake up.
Put that down. Put it down!

1680
01:34:52,112 --> 01:34:53,349
[unsettling music]

1681
01:34:55,353 --> 01:34:56,622
Amy, are you ok?

1682
01:34:57,724 --> 01:34:58,325
Amy!

1683
01:34:58,826 --> 01:34:59,628
God, help.

1684
01:35:00,128 --> 01:35:00,830
You.

1685
01:35:01,899 --> 01:35:02,600
You.

1686
01:35:03,502 --> 01:35:05,339
Take off the damn necklace!

1687
01:35:06,909 --> 01:35:08,579
[demonic whispering voices]

1688
01:35:08,612 --> 01:35:09,281
Amy?

1689
01:35:09,781 --> 01:35:10,482
Amy?

1690
01:35:11,585 --> 01:35:13,622
C'mon, you have to destroy the
vision board. C'mon.

1691
01:35:16,628 --> 01:35:18,265
[eery music and voices]

1692
01:35:19,868 --> 01:35:21,838
This wasn't on here before.

1693
01:35:21,872 --> 01:35:23,174
Just destroy it!

1694
01:35:30,488 --> 01:35:32,159
Fuck positive thinking!

1695
01:35:34,431 --> 01:35:36,902
When you call on forces in
the universe and you leave God

1696
01:35:36,935 --> 01:35:39,374
out of that equation, who
do you think is gonna answer?

1697
01:35:39,941 --> 01:35:42,112
Spirits that are not from him!

1698
01:35:42,145 --> 01:35:44,651
And now Liz has been
using innocent people as

1699
01:35:44,684 --> 01:35:47,657
sacrifices and been
using you to let in a demon.

1700
01:35:47,690 --> 01:35:49,861
I didn't know!
We have one more blood sacrifice

1701
01:35:49,894 --> 01:35:51,932
and now Liz is
gonna be out to get us.

1702
01:35:51,965 --> 01:35:53,268
We have to call
the cops or she's

1703
01:35:53,302 --> 01:35:54,537
gonna come back into our house.

1704
01:35:54,571 --> 01:35:57,175
Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, my
purse.

1705
01:35:58,211 --> 01:35:59,714
[Amy]
Hold up, Max.

1706
01:36:00,081 --> 01:36:01,183

[low tense music]

1708
01:36:05,893 --> 01:36:06,962
She's in here.

1709
01:36:08,799 --> 01:36:10,035
C'mon, let's go.

1710
01:36:11,972 --> 01:36:13,675
- Oh my God, Chef Dominic!
- Oh my God.

1711
01:36:14,176 --> 01:36:16,180
- Ok, ok.
- Ok, just call for help.

1712
01:36:16,815 --> 01:36:19,320
- God I can't call for help!
- Go get help please, Crystal.

1713
01:36:19,354 --> 01:36:21,324
Just go get help, go get help.
I'm fine.

1714
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:24,330
[glass breaking, Crystal
exclaiming in pain]

1715
01:36:24,364 --> 01:36:25,231
What's wrong?

1716
01:36:25,265 --> 01:36:27,035
[Crystal]
I just cut my arm it's fine.

1717
01:36:27,069 --> 01:36:28,739
I'll be back with help.

1718
01:36:29,073 --> 01:36:30,443
[dramatic music]

1719
01:36:30,943 --> 01:36:33,348

1721
01:37:13,462 --> 01:37:14,096
Amy...

1722
01:37:19,239 --> 01:37:20,041
Crystal...

[intrigue music]

1724
01:37:47,128 --> 01:37:48,130
[Liz]
Nobody can stop

1725
01:37:48,164 --> 01:37:49,266
your destiny now.

1726
01:37:56,414 --> 01:37:58,653
You both can't run from me
forever.

1727
01:37:59,787 --> 01:38:02,460
Amy, I just wanna talk with you.

1728
01:38:27,810 --> 01:38:28,945
[door shutting]

1729
01:38:33,822 --> 01:38:35,325
You wanted freedom.

1730
01:38:37,128 --> 01:38:41,739
You wanted powers in the
universe to flow through you.

1731
01:39:03,247 --> 01:39:06,353
You didn't want to have to
follow religious dogma.

1732
01:39:07,490 --> 01:39:08,726
Or rules of God.

1733
01:39:11,732 --> 01:39:12,432
Grow up!

1734
01:39:14,236 --> 01:39:16,240
Nothing comes without a price.

1735

[tense music]

1736
01:39:25,224 --> 01:39:26,494
[dramatic music]

1737
01:39:45,767 --> 01:39:47,737
That is why we
had to get rid of your

1738
01:39:47,771 --> 01:39:49,808
mother,
she was gonna ruin everything.

1739
01:39:51,076 --> 01:39:52,781
We had to save
you from the baptism

1740
01:39:52,814 --> 01:39:54,651
and leave you
open to be a vessel.

1741
01:39:55,820 --> 01:39:59,795
Shelley helped me with that, she
gave me a key to get in here.

1742
01:40:01,932 --> 01:40:05,304
See, I was always with you.

1743
01:40:07,911 --> 01:40:09,581
You let Crystal is escape.

1744
01:40:12,452 --> 01:40:15,291
That was a big mistake.

1745
01:40:18,297 --> 01:40:20,101
We have to pay for it now.

a sixth sacrifice

1748
01:40:25,813 --> 01:40:27,684

physical reality could have
control or power over us.

1762
01:42:12,059 --> 01:42:14,362

positive thinking, we

1763
01:42:14,395 --> 01:42:16,668
were our own God and
goddesses and that...

1764

that we master our future and
visualize our destinies and...

1765

something out there...

1766

What do we do?

1802
01:44:13,468 --> 01:44:15,005
I don't know, just we just gotta

1803
01:44:15,038 --> 01:44:16,540
keep that evil from possessing.
Ok.

1804

When I was in trouble
I was talking to a priest

1805

gonna open the door to Christ.

never got to do for you.

the same symbol as on your

where the power's coming from.

with the holy spirit.

Do you renounce
Satan and all the empty

false glamors of sin?

Don't beat yourself up, ok?

1855

There's really nothing
wrong with vision

supposed to think positively.

1857
01:47:23,347 --> 01:47:24,851
It's called faith.

1858
01:47:27,222 --> 01:47:30,863
Just don't ever forget where
that power really comes from.
