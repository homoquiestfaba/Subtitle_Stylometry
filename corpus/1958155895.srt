1
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,689
So, what's Ocilla like?

2
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:58,258
Um, I mean, it's just...

3
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:02,062
It's a quiet, peaceful town.

4
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,265
People will tend to
their business and yours, too.

5
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:11,972
You know, small town,
population about 3,400.

6
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:15,542
Just, a lot of people
are attached to farms.

7
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,278
We... We take our football
pretty seriously.

8
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,249
We're passing the hospital
here on the left.

9
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,485
There's Irwin County Hospital.

10
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:29,256
We're just a nice place to live,
a nice place to be,

11
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,124
and try to keep things quiet.

12
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:32,793
And then every once in a while,
something happens

13
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:34,061
that gets national attention.

14
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:35,495
And unfortunately,
it's not for the nice,

15
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:38,765
laid-back quality of life
we have here.

16
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,400
Ocilla is a small,
unassuming town

17
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,768
in Southern Georgia

18
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,371
where a nightmare scandal
is unraveling.

19
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,574
A growing number of women say
guards from an ICE facility

20
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:50,644
brought them into
a local hospital, shackled,

21
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:53,380
and then a gynecologist
named Dr. Mahendra Amin

22
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,482
gave them unneeded surgery

23
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:59,886
without first telling them
or getting informed consent.

24
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,356
We've been investigating
these allegations for months.

25
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:04,524
After an initial whistleblower
complaint claimed

26
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,593
that Amin performed
mass hysterectomies,

27
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:10,797
Congress called on three
federal agencies to investigate.

28
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,833
To date, it's still ongoing,

29
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,502
and most of these women say
they still don't know

30
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:18,538
what procedures they underwent
and why.

31
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,607
This is Irwin County
Detention Center.

32
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,976
This is where many of the women
who have received

33
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,813
these controversial surgeries
are and were detained.

34
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,015
I don't see any women,

35
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:31,051
but I think
we should just go talk to them.

36
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:35,122
What's your sense
of what's going on?

37
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,166
The female detainee
told you that?

38
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,605
Oh, I see. How you doing?

39
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:55,776
Could you guys kind of
step back for me?

40
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,477
Lawyers filed
a class-action lawsuit

41
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,613
on behalf of 14 Amin patients

42
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:02,649
with sworn testimony
from more than 40 women.

43
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,618
It alleges
these gynecologic procedures

44
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:06,186
amount to sexual assault,

45
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:10,624
and the women who spoke out
faced brutal retaliation.

46
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,259
Immigration lawyer Amelia Wilson

47
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:15,262
is one of the lead attorneys
behind the lawsuit.

48
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:17,831
A lot of women didn't know
or understand

49
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,900
what had happened
to their bodies.

50
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,270
There were many women
who were having procedures done

51
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,740
that they did not need
and that were invasive,

52
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,776
meaning that there was
a surgery involved,

53
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,412
or they were placed
under anesthesia.

54
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,482
And many of the women
did not consent to it.

55
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:38,518
It's not that they were
saying no to the procedure.

56
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,855
It's that no one ever explained
to them what the procedure was.

57
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,924
- There was no informed consent.
- Exactly.

58
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:45,826
Those are the main allegations,

59
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:51,431
that they were victims of crimes
committed against them,

60
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,534
that they sought to come forward

61
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,369
to speak out about
what had happened to them,

62
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:59,272
and as a result,
they were retaliated against.

63
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,641
And the retaliation
took multiple forms.

64
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:05,479
A lot of women were threatened
with isolation, for example.

65
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,581
"If you're speaking out
to the media,

66
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,782
we're going to take away
your tablet

67
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,450
so you can't communicate
with your family."

68
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,487
But to sever their access to
their children or their families

69
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:17,357
was absolutely eviscerating
for them.

70
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,092
Soon after this lawsuit
was filed,

71
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,529
ICE temporarily released all of
the women who were named in it,

72
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,064
including a 37-year-old woman

73
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:27,167
who's now living
outside of Atlanta,

74
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,669
We've been in touch with a woman
named Mbeti Ndonga

75
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,805
for months now.
We started talking to her

76
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:34,808
when she was still inside
Irwin County Detention Center.

77
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,810
She's back home
at her parents' house,

78
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,279
and we're here
to check in on her.

79
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:46,553
These are just pictures
of my... my dad.

80
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:49,055
He coached soccer for us.

81
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:52,626
And we got acclimated
to the American society

82
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,828
very easily.

83
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:57,364
Mbeti came to the U.S.
from Kenya as a toddler.

84
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:59,466
She had a very
American childhood...

85
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,969
"Saved by the Bell," mac
and cheese, and soccer games.

86
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,039
Is there a part of you that
walked into the detention center

87
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,075
and just thought, "How am I
in ICE custody right now?"

88
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,511
I couldn't really believe it.

89
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:14,014
The very first time
I was locked up in ICE,

90
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,783
it was like a surreal dungeon.

91
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:21,321
Like you walked in, and...

92
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,890
there was l-loud noises,

93
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,427
the slamming of the doors,
the echoing in the halls.

94
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:28,895
Mbeti landed in ICE custody

95
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:32,132
after her life started to spiral
in her early 20s.

96
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:34,935
She wasn't being treated
for schizoaffective disorder.

97
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,537
Her green card expired.
She committed two felonies

98
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,673
and landed
at a detention center.

99
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,908
Two months later,
she was taken to see a doctor

100
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,777
for her heavy periods.

101
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:47,380
I thought
that I would be getting

102
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,050
a-a Depo shot,

103
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,152
because that's what...
That was my regimen.

104
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:55,355
That's what was prescribed
by a previous doctor.

105
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,457
So basically, it's...
it can act as contraception,

106
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:58,992
but it can also help
with symptoms

107
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:00,961
like heavy bleeding, for instance.

108
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,495
- Right.
- And had that worked for you

109
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,431
- in the past?
- Yeah, it worked for me.

110
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:08,268
And I don't know why
the doctor didn't re-suggest it.

111
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:09,703
In her records, Amin wrote

112
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,038
that Mbeti didn't respond
to a Depo shot,

113
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,808
but the records don't show
he ever tried it.

114
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,611
Instead, he's scheduled
a dilation and curettage,

115
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:18,979
or D&C,

116
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:22,682
a medical procedure that removes
tissue from the uterus.

117
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,919
The nurse, she asked me
if I was getting a hysterectomy.

118
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,989
I said, "No, ma'am,
I'm getting a D&C."

119
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,290
She asked again.

120
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,093
I remember being
really annoyed with her

121
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:35,428
that I had to, like,
explain to myself,

122
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,498
"I'm not... I'm not wanting
to take out my womb.

123
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,867
I don't know why you're asking
about a hysterectomy."

124
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,270
Moments before
I was supposed to go under,

125
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,539
she asked both... both me
and... and the other lady.

126
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,041
- Another detainee?
- Another... Yeah,

127
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,343
another detainee, if we were
having hysterectomies.

128
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,779
Did you turn to the other
detainee next to you

129
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,214
and... and say anything?

130
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:57,884
Yeah, I mean, I was like,
what did we get ourselves into?

131
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,786
And so, at what point
did you realize

132
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:03,223
you had actually had surgery,
not just a D&C... surgery?

133
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:06,359
I woke up, and they said,
"Be careful getting up."

134
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,961
And I was like...
I'm kind of like, "Why?"

135
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:10,764
And then I-I touched my body,

136
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,533
and I had three incisions,

137
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,968
one on my side,

138
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,637
one in my belly button,
and one on my other side.

139
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,974
The surgery and the procedure
isn't even half the story.

140
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:24,411
Later, I ended up
getting a staph infection

141
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:26,212
from that procedure,

142
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,248
and I never got a second
follow-up with doctors.

143
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,683
You never had another
follow-up appointment?

144
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:33,687
I never had a follow-up
appointment with Dr. Amin.

145
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:36,056
Records show that a follow-up
appointment was scheduled

146
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:37,590
for two weeks later,

147
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,961
but don't show whether
that visit ever took place.

148
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,034
Then, seven weeks later,

149
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:51,271
Mbeti tested positive
for a staph infection.

150
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,139
While Mbeti did sign
some consent forms

151
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,575
before her surgery
in August 2019,

152
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,078
she says she didn't understand
what she was signing.

153
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,880
Now, a year and a half later,
Mbeti still doesn't know

154
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,517
if she had a hysterectomy
or not.

155
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,886
It's just heartbreaking.
You know what I'm saying? To...

156
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,355
And that's something
she's always wanted,

157
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,090
just to have kids and, like,
you know, to have...

158
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,424
So the fact that
that might have been,

159
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,527
like, stripped away from her
is... It's heartbreaking,

160
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:15,829
and it's maddening.

161
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,799
And I hope that they didn't.
You know what I'm saying?

162
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,034
I really hope
that they went in there

163
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,502
and did the surgery
they were supposed to do,

164
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,771
that they said
they were going to do.

165
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:28,842
You know, to be honest,
I've brushed over the detail.

166
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:34,347
I remember running across an
article, it was earlier in 2020,

167
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,782
thinking, "Wow, that's horrible."

168
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:41,087
But then actually finding out
that my sister is involved,

169
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,756
I don't want to know the details,

170
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:46,860
because, as her little brother,
you feel...

171
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,763
You know, the more information
I learn about it,

172
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,498
the angrier I get.

173
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,703
What has been
your greatest fear?

174
00:08:56,703 --> 00:09:02,942
Not being able to do
what a normal mother does,

175
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,445
you know? Have children,

176
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:09,049
watch them grow, and...

177
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,584
I mean, that's a very sacred thing,

178
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:16,022
and I-I feel like it's been kind of

179
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:19,793
threatened, immensely.

180
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,712
After Mbeti and
countless other women

181
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:42,515
suffered what they consider
medical torture,

182
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,984
they felt the worst
had to be over,

183
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,487
until the week of the U.S.
presidential election,

184
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:50,223
when they suddenly
faced their worst fear.

185
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,591
While the world was transfixed

186
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,061
by the most heated political
contest in generations,

187
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:58,932
ICE began quietly scheduling
these women for deportation

188
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,301
before many of them
had testified,

189
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:05,672
something Congress specifically
told ICE not to do.

190
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,323
Yanira Oldaker
was brought to the U.S.

191
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,225
when she was just 3 years old.

192
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,593
She says when she saw Amin,

193
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,995
he gave her
a transvaginal ultrasound.

194
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,197
She says she was rough
and caused her pain

195
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,967
and that she bled
for days afterward.

196
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,908
After this call, Yanira became
one of the women

197
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,309
that was temporarily released

198
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,445
as part of
the class-action lawsuit.

199
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,147
She's the lead plaintiff.

200
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,650
You and your team
were working overnight.

201
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,552
I mean, racing against the clock,

202
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,721
while Yanira, meanwhile,
was put in a bus

203
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,056
and was on the way
to her deportation flight.

204
00:10:57,056 --> 00:11:00,793
That's exactly right.
The team worked without stop.

205
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,962
We were just like,
"We have to get something,

206
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,397
like a stay of removal,

207
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,432
temporary restraining order,
anything we can."

208
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,102
We got in touch
with her deportation officer,

209
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:12,171
and he said that her removal
had been stopped.

210
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,806
When ICE does something
like that, I mean,

211
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,575
how does it affect
a federal investigation

212
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,777
when these are potential
key witnesses?

213
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:21,514
ICE has a policy
to not remove people

214
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,217
who are part
of an investigation.

215
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:26,986
But we also know that
during the Trump years,

216
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,556
that policy was
not really followed.

217
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:32,825
I mean, we know even based
on our experience with Mbeti,

218
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:36,996
when I spoke to ICE
and said she is a victim, "A,"

219
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:41,401
"B," she is a witness, and, "C,"
she's a potential plaintiff.

220
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,969
Why are you removing her?

221
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:47,840
The response from ICE was,
"Our job is to remove people."

222
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,275
ICE denies any allegation

223
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,444
that they attempted
to impede the investigation

224
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,613
by deporting women.

225
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:56,583
The only thing protecting Mbeti
from immediate deportation

226
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,185
at this point
is the ongoing litigation.

227
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,386
And so far,

228
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,223
the Biden administration
hasn't intervened.

229
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,359
Are you concerned that
if her protections are lifted,

230
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,760
that she could be deported?

231
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,732
100%, because just before
this litigation really took off,

232
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,536
she was at imminent risk
of removal.

233
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,037
I just don't want her
to go away again.

234
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,405
I don't want her to be locked
in a cage.

235
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,608
I don't want her to be
alone in Kenya.

236
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:23,443
Feeling that Mbeti
was, like, isolated

237
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:26,012
and feeling like she was
going through this by herself,

238
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:28,381
that's the worst.

239
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,750
For me, it was... It was, uh...

240
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:36,155
It was pretty good
having both my kids here.

241
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,857
Mm-hmm.

242
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,900
She sang ABCs to my son for...

243
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,402
long time on the phone,

244
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:53,473
so to have that in person and my
daughter also be a part of that

245
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,041
was...

246
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:01,881
Ah, man. I'm sorry, guys.

247
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,449
My children
mean the world to me,

248
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,385
so it's good to see them happy

249
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:08,221
and experience something
with their aunt, you know?

250
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:11,758
And every day since
has been great.

251
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:14,093
We've spoken with women
in six different countries,

252
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,629
from Jamaica to
El Salvador to Canada,

253
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,699
who were deported
after seeing Amin.

254
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,668
Some of them still
haven't been contacted

255
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,436
by federal investigators,

256
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:27,106
begging the question,
just how many women are out there?

257
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,208
Why is it hard to know
exactly how many women

258
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,443
have been affected?

259
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:32,612
We're talking about
a deportation machine

260
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:34,013
or conveyor belt.

261
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:37,817
So all these women who came
through the detention center

262
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,654
and saw this doctor
is almost incalculable.

263
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:46,859
We tracked down
a woman named Yuridia

264
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,661
who was deported just three days
after she had surgery by Amin

265
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,129
in August 2020.

266
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,933
She's a single mom of six young
daughters and, like many others,

267
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:57,603
hasn't been contacted to testify
in the federal investigation.

268
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,113
Okay.

269
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,336
<i>Sí.</i>

270
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,039
Once Yuridia arrived in the U.S.,

271
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,775
she found work
and started a family.

272
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,378
But soon after, her partner
became abusive,

273
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,180
leading to a series
of domestic violence incidents.

274
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,050
In one altercation, Yuridia ran
to the neighbor's house.

275
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,985
They called the police.

276
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,254
When they arrived,
Yuridia was arrested.

277
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,490
Her partner was not.

278
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,516
Her daughters, all U.S. citizens,

279
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,485
were eventually picked up
by her sister

280
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:55,588
and brought to Mexico.

281
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,056
What was your first memory

282
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,559
of walking into
Irwin County Detention Center?

283
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:10,536
Why did you originally see
the doctor when you were there?

284
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,645
So you reported
that you had rib pain.

285
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,582
I guess, like, how did that
get you to the gynecologist?

286
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:45,805
Yuridia says
at her next appointment,

287
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:48,541
she was told she would
have to have surgery.

288
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:29,482
I have your... some of
your medical records here.

289
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:33,753
When you first went to see
Dr. Amin, did you have...

290
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,288
and I'm listing the symptoms

291
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,490
that are...
that are listed here...

292
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,159
Did you have chronic
pelvic pain?

293
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,195
The second diagnosis that he has
here is a medical term

294
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,198
that means basically
that you had a very heavy period

295
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,868
that lasted longer than normal.
Is that true?

296
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,742
The next one is that...
It's a medical term

297
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,445
for... for pain
during menstruation.

298
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:00,947
Like not more than usual

299
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,882
or not... nothing
out of the ordinary.

300
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:27,006
In the last six months,
Yuridia's attorneys have been

301
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:29,241
working to overturn
her immigration case,

302
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:32,044
which would allow her to return
to the U.S. with her daughters

303
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,714
and fight for a chance
at a green card.

304
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:37,316
While legal precedent shows
the chance of her making it back

305
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,619
is very slim,
her lawyer is confident

306
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,754
that she has a shot.

307
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,601
Aah!

308
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:36,442
This story became the target
of intense political debate,

309
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:39,445
with Democrats calling for ICE
to halt deportations

310
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:42,548
and Republicans calling
into question the allegations.

311
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:47,920
The AP's review did not find
evidence of mass hysterectomies.

312
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,256
A team of the country's
top OB-GYNs

313
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:52,291
determined that
while they did not find

314
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,794
that Amin performed
mass hysterectomies,

315
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:59,665
he did perform numerous
unneeded gynecologic procedures.

316
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,334
They reviewed more than
3,000 pages of medical records

317
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,470
for 19 women who saw him

318
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,573
and presented
their findings to Congress.

319
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:10,076
So, you were part of
the independent medical review team.

320
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:11,544
What did you find?

321
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,913
One of the first patterns
that we saw

322
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:17,917
was just basically
overly aggressive,

323
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:20,186
sometimes un-indicated care.

324
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:23,189
And sometimes,
that did involve procedures,

325
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,924
as well as surgical procedures,

326
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:28,928
so, in-office procedures
like transvaginal ultrasounds

327
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,097
that, you know,
weren't really indicated,

328
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,199
as well as even
surgical procedures

329
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:36,869
like laparoscopic procedures
that weren't always indicated.

330
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:39,638
You say it wasn't indicated.
Does that mean

331
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:42,641
there was no medical reason?
It wasn't medically necessary?

332
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,977
Correct.
So, not medically necessary.

333
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,079
Any time you take a woman
to the operating room

334
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,981
and perform a surgery,
there's risks.

335
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,950
You can have bleeding,
infections,

336
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,452
damage to nearby organs
like the bladder or the bowel,

337
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:57,690
damage to nerves,
surgical site infections, pain.

338
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,825
Another more disturbing thing
that we saw

339
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,895
was just lack of providing
informed consent.

340
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:04,930
We talk about
informed consent a lot,

341
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,999
and sometimes, it is diminished

342
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,535
to just signing a piece of paper.

343
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:13,639
But the actual consent process
involves an understanding

344
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:17,243
and a discussion between
the patient and the physician.

345
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:19,712
We didn't see evidence of that.

346
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:22,281
When you learned the Dr. Amin
wasn't board-certified

347
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,649
and was doing these surgeries

348
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,050
contracted by
the federal government,

349
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,719
did it surprise you?

350
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,354
It did.

351
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:30,222
And why is that?

352
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,491
For a vulnerable
population of women,

353
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,294
I would think
that our government

354
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:40,533
would be providing them
with appropriate care.

355
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:44,170
I am concerned when I hear

356
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,907
that this doctor
was not board-certified,

357
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:51,076
because I don't think that
that would be a premier doctor

358
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,279
for a woman to be seeing.

359
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,549
In a series of statements,
Amin denied all wrongdoing.

360
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:58,517
He and his lawyer
declined multiple requests

361
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:01,287
for an interview,
citing ongoing litigation.

362
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:02,521
One of the independent doctors

363
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:06,325
said it's possible
Amin saved a patient's life.

364
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,794
Dr. Amin's lawyer,
in a statement that he sent us,

365
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:11,463
he said that the records
that you all had access to

366
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:15,401
to do this review were severely
incomplete at best.

367
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:17,002
He said that because of that,

368
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,638
the review couldn't have been
conclusive or accurate.

369
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,006
What is your response to that?

370
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,708
Well, yeah, I would certainly

371
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,710
love to see more
medical records,

372
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,746
but from the medical records
that we did have,

373
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:30,482
we were able to come up
with the conclusion.

374
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:33,285
So I don't think any amount
of medical records

375
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,322
would corroborate
medical necessity

376
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:38,791
for many of these procedures
that were performed.

377
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:42,428
But I would welcome
seeing and reviewing

378
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:45,564
a complete medical record
for these women.

379
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,869
A group of independent doctors
has been reviewing

380
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,905
a lot of the medical records
of these female patients.

381
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:55,908
And they say the linchpin
of this investigation

382
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:57,876
are the pathology reports.

383
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:01,680
We've tracked down the
pathologist's courier,

384
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,451
who also happens to be
the pathologist's daughter.

385
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:08,220
She had a lot of insights on
how this whole operation works,

386
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,056
because she is the person
who picks up the specimens

387
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,658
from Dr. Amin's hospital

388
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:15,928
and transports them
to her father's lab.

389
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:19,265
We are going to Irwin County
Hospital in Ocilla, Georgia,

390
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:21,333
and that's where
I pick up specimens.

391
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:24,803
And I bring those back
to Crisp County Hospital

392
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:28,474
for Dr. Latham
to look at and diagnose.

393
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:29,975
And then we send those diagnoses

394
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,611
back to Irwin County
Hospital patients.

395
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,580
We reached out to a number
of medical professionals

396
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,982
who were in some way involved
with these surgeries

397
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,350
or specimens.

398
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,987
Arden Latham was the only one
who agreed to talk to us.

399
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,555
The specimens she transfers

400
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:47,126
are from general population
and detainee patients.

401
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,661
- You get to the hospital.
- Yes.

402
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:51,030
- And then what do you do?
- So, I'd walk over there

403
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,898
and go into the lab
at that point.

404
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:55,267
And they have all
the specimens out for me.

405
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,237
I just take the bags,
and as I put each jar,

406
00:23:58,237 --> 00:24:00,939
each bag in the bucket,
I, you know,

407
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,276
mark off a list and initial
that patient's paperwork.

408
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,511
Right, so you're just verifying,

409
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,012
- "Yes, I have this organ."
- Yes.

410
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,814
- "Yes, I have this cyst."
- Yes.

411
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:11,850
On an average week, and I know
it's different week to week,

412
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,419
what are you picking up?

413
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:16,922
Ovarian cysts,
ovaries, sometimes,

414
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,490
fallopian tubes,

415
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,960
any kind of tumor or cyst
that has to do with,

416
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,728
you know,
the female reproductive system.

417
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:25,597
Is that consistently
for the last couple years?

418
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,766
- Yeah, pretty much.
- But when looking at the names

419
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,968
and when checking off,
you know, each patient,

420
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,403
did you ever notice,
I don't know,

421
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,806
any kind of pattern
that seemed unusual?

422
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:38,177
There are a lot of Spanish names.

423
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:40,412
A lot of that, you know,
can come with the area,

424
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:43,682
but it does seem
a little bit disproportionate

425
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,618
for the entire population of Ocilla,

426
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,020
demographically speaking.

427
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,289
At what point did you start
to piece together

428
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:52,391
why you were seeing
so many Hispanic names?

429
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:54,193
Um, not until recently,

430
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:56,428
'cause I didn't...
I didn't really know

431
00:24:56,428 --> 00:25:01,133
that there was an ICE facility
until like a month ago or so.

432
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:03,936
- Wow.
- Yeah, it's total news to me.

433
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:06,238
So once I... once I heard
that there was an ICE facility,

434
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:09,041
I was like, "That's why there
are so many Hispanic names."

435
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:12,544
But before that,
I had never known why.

436
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,680
When Arden brings the specimens
to the lab,

437
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,349
her dad then decides whether
the tissues are cancerous

438
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,219
or otherwise need to be removed.

439
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:22,554
Was there a disconnect at times

440
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:25,624
between what Dr. Amin's
diagnosis was

441
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:29,361
and what your father was able
to discover or not discover?

442
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,730
I think definitely there was
sometimes a, you know,

443
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,366
"I'm not finding this."
And, um...

444
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:38,270
And... You know, and again,
there was a question of whether

445
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,173
a removal was needed or not.
So there was always a question

446
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:43,709
of whether he was overzealous
in that realm.

447
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,211
And those were conversations
that, I mean,

448
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,448
you guys were having before
this story became national news.

449
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:52,518
Oh, yes, absolutely.

450
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:54,553
When this story came up,

451
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:58,524
did you sort of feel the weight
of the types of specimens

452
00:25:58,524 --> 00:25:59,958
that you were transporting?

453
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,528
If you're used to the same thing

454
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:04,763
over and over and over again,
you don't think about it.

455
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,999
There's no, like,
depth of thought of...

456
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:10,436
I mean, like, I knew that I had
to drive safely and carefully

457
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:12,905
so that I don't, like, spill anything.

458
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:16,508
So that does change, you know,
when you think of,

459
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:19,845
what if the... What if this
person didn't want this done?

460
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:21,313
And what if this is something

461
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:23,782
that someone now
is traumatized over,

462
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,851
and I'm just driving it around?

463
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,920
Why are you doing
this interview now?

464
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,156
Um, I think it's
the right thing to do.

465
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:34,626
Ocilla being so heavily
Caucasian and so rural

466
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:37,796
and in the the Deep South,
essentially,

467
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:41,066
um, the political opinion
of immigrants

468
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:43,802
is very, very negative.

469
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:47,039
There's a tendency to forget
that people are human beings.

470
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:53,212
And I just want to do what I can
to help justice be served.

471
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,282
Was there anything
that you learned

472
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,685
from seeing
the pathology reports

473
00:26:59,685 --> 00:27:04,156
that allowed you to... to draw
certain conclusions or findings?

474
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:06,892
I mean, the pathology reports
just corroborated the fact

475
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:10,929
that procedures were being done
that were un-indicated...

476
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:15,501
so, for example, the description
of a simple ovarian cyst

477
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:19,238
at the time of
a laparoscopic procedure.

478
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:23,108
Really no alarm bells
that this could be a precancer.

479
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:25,377
And removing it and
sending it to pathology,

480
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,679
it's corroborated
that it's a follicular cyst.

481
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,948
So this is a normal portion
of someone's ovary

482
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:31,950
that did not need to be removed.

483
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,556
We reached out to Arden's
parents for an interview.

484
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:39,525
They refused to comment.
And Amin's lawyer

485
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:42,561
didn't respond to questions
about Arden's account.

486
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:45,531
But when we visited
the 3,000-person town of Ocilla,

487
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:48,600
people were anxious to defend
their hometown doctor.

488
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,004
The mayor of Ocilla, Matt Seale,
invited us to his local cafe

489
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:55,407
with the hopes of shining
a positive light on his town.

490
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,242
How did the community here react

491
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:00,212
when this became,
you know, a national story?

492
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:03,115
I mean, obviously,
it was very provocative.

493
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:06,652
So people were asking questions.

494
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:10,756
But the sense I got was that
folks were immediately skeptical

495
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:15,093
and just very unsure about, you
know, "What's all this about?

496
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,562
This doesn't sound right."

497
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:19,197
The way things
kind of get painted,

498
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,667
it was as if there's
some kind of dungeon

499
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,468
in the basement
of the detention center,

500
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,103
and we're just lining people up

501
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:27,539
and doing God-awful
things to them.

502
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,676
We have talked to many
other women who have said

503
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:32,811
they did have procedures done

504
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,513
that they felt
weren't consensual

505
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:37,416
and they felt were
not necessary.

506
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:38,650
And I would just say

507
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,452
if there's any kind of
allegation like that...

508
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:43,155
I mean, any kind of allegation
of that... of that kind

509
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:45,724
should be taken seriously,
should be investigated.

510
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:46,925
I mean, I wouldn't... Again,

511
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,994
and I don't think
there's any kind of,

512
00:28:48,994 --> 00:28:50,562
"Oh, well,
this may have happened.

513
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,797
Let's sweep it under the rug."

514
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:52,965
That's...
That's not the attitude

515
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:54,499
of anybody in this community.

516
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:58,337
But that's... that's a far cry
from mass hysterectomies

517
00:28:58,337 --> 00:28:59,871
and the claims
of things happening

518
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:01,773
actually at
the detention center.

519
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:05,978
But we as a community probably
know him a little better

520
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:08,080
than... than people
from the outside coming in,

521
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,514
no offense, with cameras

522
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,516
and asking, you know,
tough questions.

523
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:14,553
"Oh, these allegations, we need
to... We need to dig into this."

524
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:17,089
Well, the people
that supported him

525
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,357
were the people
that knew him best,

526
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:20,826
the people that
he delivered their babies.

527
00:29:22,828 --> 00:29:25,297
Someone directed us
to a Facebook page

528
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:27,532
called
"We Stand With Mahendra Amin,"

529
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,768
which is fascinating. Look at this.

530
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,937
There are two
pregnant women here.

531
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,905
They're wearing T-shirts
that say,

532
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:36,408
"We stand with
Dr. Mahendra Amin."

533
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:38,677
There are more than 1,500 people

534
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:41,446
who are following it,
who like this page.

535
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,349
There are only 10,000 people
in this county.

536
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:50,122
He delivered
two of my grandkids.

537
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,523
How did the community react

538
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:53,492
when... when he was accused
of... of all this?

539
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:56,795
Well, a lot of people,
they didn't believe it anyway.

540
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,131
They still go to him,
you know, like my daughter.

541
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:02,668
She had heard it,
and she didn't believe it,

542
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:04,569
'cause, you know,
she still went to him.

543
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:07,105
So he didn't really lose
any patients or...

544
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,441
No.

545
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:12,044
You guys have this sort
of national scandal

546
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:14,179
that just landed
in your small town.

547
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,782
What are your thoughts?
People that was accusing him

548
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:19,017
was of... of Latino,

549
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,852
which, there's nothing wrong
with that right there,

550
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,821
but I don't know
if they misunderstand him

551
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,456
communication-wise.

552
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:26,692
Far as I know, I've never

553
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:29,428
heard anybody say anything bad
about Dr. Amin.

554
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:30,996
He's a good baby doctor and...

555
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:33,031
Would you, you know,
be open to the idea

556
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:37,402
that maybe Dr. Amin has done
great things for families here

557
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:38,503
in delivering babies

558
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,038
and treating them well...
He has, he has.

559
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:44,710
...but then also has maybe done
some unethical things, as well?

560
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:48,213
If he has, I-I-I had never
heard of it, seen it,

561
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,749
or I-I...

562
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:52,918
I'd have to see it
to believe it.

563
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:59,091
Thank you.

564
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:01,393
Why do you not believe
the allegations?

565
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:04,262
You don't hear anybody else
that's not in the prison

566
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,031
saying anything. I think...

567
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,467
I don't...
would still believe that.

568
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:09,968
What would be,
like, the incentive

569
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:13,105
for somebody to say this
if it wasn't true?

570
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:15,240
To make money. To get money.

571
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,011
To get their 15 minutes of fame.

572
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:23,181
I just... I just think
it's all made-up.

573
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:25,050
Mayor Matt,
as the town calls him,

574
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:28,320
isn't surprised by the support.
He says Irwin County Hospital

575
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,023
was at risk of going under,
and Amin basically saved it.

576
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:36,228
He may quite literally
have kept our hospital open

577
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,563
when others around us
are closing,

578
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,832
mostly through delivering
babies, like I said.

579
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:44,035
So I think that's why you saw
the groundswell of support.

580
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:47,639
People who knew him
knew the truth.

581
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:48,807
But lawyers for the plaintiffs

582
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:50,776
say his motivation
is directly linked

583
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:53,512
to him bringing
"business to Irwin County,"

584
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:56,681
that he did these surgeries
to bring in more revenue.

585
00:31:56,681 --> 00:32:00,085
In 2015, Amin and the Hospital
Authority of Irwin County

586
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,953
settled a lawsuit that alleged

587
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:03,321
they billed
the federal government

588
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,657
for false Medicare
and Medicaid claims,

589
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:08,427
though there was
no determination of liability.

590
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:11,930
In 2018, he started seeing
ICE detainees.

591
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,932
Lawyers representing
Amin patients say

592
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,202
by increasing the number
and types of procedures,

593
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:20,138
he could bill the government
exponentially more.

594
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:23,675
I think Dr. Amin saw an
opportunity to... to make money.

595
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,443
So, first off, women,
nobody believes women

596
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,145
when they say anything.

597
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:30,115
They're immigrants.
They're in detention.

598
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:32,083
It was a great
opportunity for him.

599
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:35,053
And I'm afraid he's not
the only person out there

600
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:40,559
that opportunistically seizes on
detained people to make money.

601
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,060
As calls for the detention center

602
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,696
to be shut down intensify,
locals argue

603
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,531
it's the biggest
private employer,

604
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:49,534
and their county heavily
relies on its revenue.

605
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,169
How would the community
actually be affected

606
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:52,938
if that detention center
went away?

607
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:56,007
When you have
a multimillion-dollar facility

608
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,943
get... get knocked down
in assessed value,

609
00:32:57,943 --> 00:32:59,644
and of course,
that has the trickle effect

610
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,814
of less revenue
by a significant amount,

611
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,349
yeah, that just..
that just affects everything.

612
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,685
So, it's not even
just our ability

613
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:08,086
to provide the normal services.

614
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,488
It's, we want to advance.
We want to make things better.

615
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,691
We want to provide
new amenities.

616
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:15,827
And that just, you know, the...
the ripple effect there is...

617
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:19,798
I don't know
if it can be overstated.

618
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:21,999
I've been to so many detention
centers in the United States.

619
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:23,401
I know you have, too.

620
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:26,605
They're very often
in rural areas,

621
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:29,207
remote,

622
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,376
places without a lot of work.

623
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:35,847
But that is not a reason to keep
the detention center open...

624
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,649
that people rely on it for work.

625
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:40,352
<i>I </i>don't believe it is.
Mm.

626
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,388
I don't believe
that you can justify

627
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:47,492
keeping an institution open
that is evil

628
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:52,764
because it it quells
or minimizes another evil,

629
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:55,100
which is, like, poverty
and lack of education

630
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,402
and lack of opportunity.

631
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:00,305
On May 20th, the Biden
administration intervened.

632
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:02,307
They directed ICE
to end its contract

633
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:05,510
with Irwin County Detention
Center as soon as possible,

634
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:09,981
effectively guaranteeing that it
is shut down as an ICE facility.

635
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:13,451
All of the female detainees
have already been removed.

636
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,326
In addition to the women
who have already been deported,

637
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:23,295
we've also found
several other women

638
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:25,297
now released
and living in the U.S.

639
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:26,598
who saw Amin

640
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:30,502
and still haven't been contacted
by federal investigators.

641
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:32,003
Hey!

642
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:35,273
One of those women
is an Anne Alobwede.

643
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,108
I'm good.

644
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:39,577
How are you doing?

645
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:43,281
Yeah, I know.

646
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:46,284
I got out December 16th.

647
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:48,853
- Oh, wow, that's...
- Right before Christmas. Yeah.

648
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,693
Yes, ma'am, I did. That's...

649
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:57,162
Anne came to the U.S.
from Cameroon as a teenager.

650
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:58,797
She was the patient
lying next to Mbeti

651
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:01,166
on the day of their surgeries.
22 months.

652
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:04,936
This is the first time they've
spoken since being released.

653
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:08,306
Are you having complications,
if I may ask?

654
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,213
Really?

655
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:31,062
Really?

656
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,373
Yeah.

657
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:50,281
Yeah, something went wrong,
because I...

658
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:53,585
I was still having pain, and...

659
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:01,559
Yeah.

660
00:36:03,962 --> 00:36:05,864
Yeah. Me, too.

661
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:09,768
For the first time
since her surgery,

662
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:12,971
Mbeti has a doctor's appointment
to learn what happened to her.

663
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,242
I'm kind of nervous

664
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:20,211
and a little bit anxious,

665
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:24,115
so we'll see what kind
of information I can get.

666
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,520
This is a moment

667
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,789
that all of these women
have been waiting for,

668
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:33,625
you know,
just having an appointment

669
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,026
after they leave
the ICE facility

670
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,227
with an independent doctor

671
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,329
who can just tell them
what happened to them

672
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,165
and what their health status is.

673
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:43,301
And specifically for Mbeti,
she has one big question.

674
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,437
Will she be able to have kids?

675
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:16,801
According to Mbeti's records
and Dr. Mueller,

676
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:20,538
Mbeti was given
an unnecessary ultrasound, D&C,

677
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:24,209
scar tissue removal,
laparoscopy, and cystectomy,

678
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:26,711
the surgical removal
of a follicular cyst

679
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:29,013
that didn't need to be removed.

680
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:30,915
While Mbeti didn't get
a hysterectomy,

681
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,985
she could still have trouble
carrying a pregnancy.

682
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:37,388
It's important to remember
that surgical procedures,

683
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,824
even if they weren't
hysterectomy,

684
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:44,996
can have bearing on
a woman's future fertility.

685
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:48,399
I had a look at the ultrasound,

686
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:50,502
and if I were to get pregnant,

687
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:54,272
I would have
a complicated pregnancy.

688
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:58,076
And that's what I'm really
thinking in the back of my head.

689
00:37:58,076 --> 00:38:01,513
It was a relief to see
that I had my uterus.

690
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:06,818
I know that I still have
a long way to go.

691
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:14,893
I mean, being a mom is...
is almost every girl's dream.

692
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:20,298
Having that threatened is...
is really very scary.

693
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,667
While the class-action
litigation is still pending,

694
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:25,737
Mbeti's lawyers are working
to secure her a new visa

695
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:27,772
which protects victims
of criminal activity

696
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:30,141
who testify in that investigation.

697
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,709
If both are denied,

698
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:34,345
Mbeti could be immediately
deported to Kenya,

699
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:37,115
where she has
no support system.

700
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:42,921
After an intense legal process,

701
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:46,791
a U.S. judge agreed to reopen
Yuridia's immigration case,

702
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:50,261
an outcome so rare that
experienced lawyers only see it

703
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,797
a handful of times in their career.

704
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,632
This means that Yuridia
and her daughters

705
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:58,703
can now legally reenter the U.S.

706
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:01,973
We're back in Saltillo to visit
with Yuridia and her family.

707
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:04,809
Against all odds,
Yuridia and her six daughters

708
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,812
will be getting on
a flight tomorrow for the U.S.

709
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:11,382
to start the process
to get permanent status.

710
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,364
How are you feeling
about tomorrow?

711
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:44,582
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

712
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,551
♪ Happy birthday ♪

713
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:03,101
How do you imagine the moment

714
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:06,237
when you step foot
back in the U.S.?

715
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,360
So, we're just getting out
of customs and baggage claim,

716
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,296
and they haven't made it out yet.

717
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,597
We were told
to go one direction,

718
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,866
and the ICE officers
took them into another office.

719
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:12,737
So now really, it's just...
It's a waiting game.

720
00:41:12,737 --> 00:41:14,105
Yuridia's immigration attorneys

721
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:16,841
have been preparing
for this moment for months.

722
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,810
If Yuridia makes it
through immigration,

723
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,546
this will be the first time
they're meeting.

724
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:22,914
How you guys feeling?

725
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:24,716
Excited. Overwhelmed.

726
00:41:24,716 --> 00:41:26,684
We didn't expect it
to take as long as it did,

727
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:28,486
but we're just glad
that it's here.

728
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,022
I mean, we've thought about her
and the kids for so long,

729
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:32,323
and we've never met her.

730
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,959
So we're just beyond excited
to meet her in person.

731
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:37,362
Is there anything that's
concerning you right now?

732
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:40,164
Honestly, just her getting here
to be with us,

733
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:43,368
and then once... Like, it just
has felt really difficult,

734
00:41:43,368 --> 00:41:44,602
her being so far away

735
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,471
and, like, things being
so out of our control.

736
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:48,272
So it feels reassuring
to have her here

737
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:49,974
and feel like we'll have
a little bit more control

738
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:52,243
over how things go
and the flow of the case.

739
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:55,646
And going forward,
we'll see how everything goes.

740
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,584
She get through customs?

741
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:02,053
She said
so I'm asking her...

742
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:05,656
- Okay.
- ...what is next.

743
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,825
She's typing.

744
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:10,328
Okay.

745
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:13,664
What is it, 100 person?

746
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,466
Yeah. Oh, the office is asking?

747
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,869
Yes, I texted it
to her earlier.

748
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,539
She said they're almost done.

749
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,573
Oh, great. Okay.

750
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:24,375
We're going to burst.

751
00:42:27,612 --> 00:42:30,515
That's them. Is that Yuridia?

752
00:42:33,818 --> 00:42:36,154
Oh, you guys are so cute!

753
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:41,893
Nice to meet you!

754
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:13,891
Yuridia and her daughters
have started

755
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:15,893
to rebuild their life again
in the U.S.

756
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:18,429
while her immigration case
continues to unfold.

757
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,931
- Cheese!
- Cheese!
