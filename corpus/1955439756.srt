00:00:08,647 --> 00:00:11,083
[Chris]<i> It's a movie with Chloë Sevigny</i>
<i>and Vincent Gallo.</i>

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,787
<i>And in it, Chloë Sevigny goes down</i>
<i>on Vincent Gallo for like five minutes.</i>

5
00:00:14,854 --> 00:00:17,289
{\an8}-<i>And they use his real penis.</i>
-[Chester] <i>That's just pornography.</i>

6
00:00:18,057 --> 00:00:21,293
{\an8}No, it's not. It's called acting.
If you wrote in a script

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,963
that I suck your dick for five minutes,
I would do it.

8
00:00:24,263 --> 00:00:25,765
Why? Because you're paying me.

9
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:28,968
I wouldn't suck your dick for six minutes,
I wouldn't do it for four.

10
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:30,636
I would fucking full method it,

11
00:00:30,703 --> 00:00:34,040
and just Daniel Day-Lewis your penis
in my mouth for five minutes.

12
00:00:34,673 --> 00:00:35,908
Does that make me gay? No.

13
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:37,910
Just makes me, like, a really good actor.

14
00:00:37,977 --> 00:00:41,313
Okay, in this situation, why am I
the one paying you to suck my dick?

15
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,617
-Would you rather suck my dick?
-I don't wanna suck anyone's dick.

16
00:00:44,683 --> 00:00:46,786
You shouldn't have written it
in the script.

I'll get you your money. Don't worry.

00:00:53,292 --> 00:00:54,860

Fuck it, call the cops.
I don't give a shit anymore.

00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:04,637
It's all you. Goodbye.

00:01:05,037 --> 00:01:07,173
-What happened?
-I am so screwed.

25
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,908
"I'm so screwed. Feel bad for me."

{\an8}Yeah, and the trunk is super spacious.

33
00:01:30,362 --> 00:01:33,365
{\an8}It's really big, like a living room.
Could fit a love seat.

No.

00:01:36,669 --> 00:01:38,070
No, no, not really, no.

I'll see you there, Carlo. Thank you.

-[Chester] I'm learning Portuguese.
-I gotta change this.

All right? And when did you start smoking?

62
00:02:59,084 --> 00:03:02,688
What? I needed to change things up, okay?
It was either this or Scientology.

63
00:03:02,755 --> 00:03:05,858
And I can't wear maritime-style uniforms.
It makes my face look fat.

64
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:10,195
Well, I just sold this car,
so, let's take care of it, and no smoking.

00:03:10,262 --> 00:03:13,766
Can you cover my register for 30 minutes?
I need to meet this guy at 10:30.

What guy?

67
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:18,003
Carlo. The guy from Craigslist.
He called me this morning.

68
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,472
He wants to buy the car.
This guy has an amazing story.

69
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:22,107
He just moved to this country--

70
00:03:22,174 --> 00:03:25,778
-You sold your car without consulting me?
-Are you even listening to me?

71
00:03:25,844 --> 00:03:28,180
-That's pretty selfish.
-Can you cover my register?

72
00:03:28,247 --> 00:03:30,849
If you sell your car,
how do we get to Rock the Bells?

73
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,786
I can't go to a concert.
I just told you I'm gonna meet Carlo.

74
00:03:33,852 --> 00:03:35,354
Then I'll work a double. Go home.

75
00:03:35,421 --> 00:03:39,491
-Pack. That's my night. I'm booked up.
-You know what I did to get these tickets?

76
00:03:39,758 --> 00:03:42,361
I'm not going to a concert
with your brother's fake tickets.

77
00:03:42,428 --> 00:03:44,863
Sell 'em
and get your car out of the impound, man.

78
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,332
-Grow up. Get a life.
-Okay.

79
00:03:46,398 --> 00:03:48,367
And what are you packing for, huh?

80
00:03:48,434 --> 00:03:51,370
Brazil. I'm going to Brazil.
You remember Brazil, right?

81
00:03:51,437 --> 00:03:54,306
Doing that this early in the morning?
The Brazil conversation?

82
00:03:54,373 --> 00:03:56,408
-Not...
-All right. All right. I'll do it.

83
00:03:56,475 --> 00:03:58,143
Well, did you get your ticket yet?

84
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,212
I mean, not yet, but I will.

85
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:02,781
No. I didn't think so.
We're going to the concert.

86
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:04,817
No, no, no.
We're not going to the concert.

87
00:04:04,883 --> 00:04:08,153
Because as soon as I sell this car
I'm using that money to buy a ticket.

88
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,190
I'm serious this time.
You're not gonna talk me out of it, okay?

89
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,959
You're...?
You're still coming with me, right?

90
00:04:14,426 --> 00:04:17,296
Yeah, I'm coming with you, okay?
For the millionth time.

91
00:04:17,363 --> 00:04:18,230
Good.

92
00:04:18,297 --> 00:04:20,332
So,
then stop being such a downer about it.

93
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,867
-All right?
-I'm not a downer.

94
00:04:21,934 --> 00:04:25,271
It's just that you've talked about Brazil
every week for the last 4 years,

95
00:04:25,337 --> 00:04:28,807
so, it's like the boy who cried wolf,
then got gang-banged by the wolf

96
00:04:28,874 --> 00:04:31,910
-and all his friends.
-I don't wanna hear another word from you.

97
00:04:36,982 --> 00:04:40,219
Real quick, can we go over this
whole moving-to-another-continent idea?

98
00:04:40,286 --> 00:04:44,023
I mean, I'm down, I just wanna make sure
that we're not gonna regret it forever.

99
00:04:44,156 --> 00:04:45,057
That's a good idea.

100
00:04:45,124 --> 00:04:46,325
Yeah, okay.

101
00:04:47,826 --> 00:04:50,396
This is how I plan
to retire when we move to Brazil.

102
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,932
-Shit, you trying to smoke that?
-What? No.

103
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:55,501
-You wanna snort it?
-How would--?

104
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:59,104
-You're fucking crazy. I'm in, though.
-No, no, no. This is guayusa.

105
00:04:59,571 --> 00:05:01,907
-I don't get it.
-It's an Amazonian super leaf,

106
00:05:01,974 --> 00:05:04,176
packed with caffeine
and natural antioxidants.

107
00:05:04,243 --> 00:05:06,378
I've been researching this stuff
for months.

108
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:08,047
You wanna know how much it costs

109
00:05:08,113 --> 00:05:10,883
-to ship and produce this one bottle?
-Four seventy-nine?

110
00:05:11,183 --> 00:05:12,151
Seventy-five cents.

111
00:05:12,818 --> 00:05:14,953
And they sell it here for $4.79,
for people...

112
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,121
For people like that.

113
00:05:16,588 --> 00:05:19,458
That's a $3 profit margin
that these companies are making.

114
00:05:19,525 --> 00:05:22,061
That's what you're doing
in your spare time, Chester?

115
00:05:22,127 --> 00:05:23,329
Researching bottled drinks?

116
00:05:23,395 --> 00:05:25,464
-That's weird.
-Oh, shut up. That's not weird.

117
00:05:25,531 --> 00:05:26,532
Guayusa's the future.

118
00:05:26,598 --> 00:05:29,101
-Will you stop pronouncing it like that?
-Like what?

119
00:05:29,168 --> 00:05:30,869
-Guayusa.
-Guayusa.

120
00:05:31,103 --> 00:05:32,571
-Guayusa.
-Guayusa.

121
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:34,273
-Guayusa.
-I'm saying guayusa.

122
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:36,308
Okay. So, when we get to Brazil,

123
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:39,244
your plan is to start some natural
energy drink using guayusa,

124
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:41,513
and then sell it
to high-end markets in the U.S.?

125
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,614
I mean, genius, right?

126
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:47,352
I don't know how to explain this,
but your plan is fucking dumb as shit.

127
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:48,987
Does that make sense?

128
00:05:49,054 --> 00:05:50,289
Is that registering or--?

129
00:05:50,355 --> 00:05:52,925
Forget it. You're out.
Have fun making minimum wage.

130
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:55,461
Let me explain why it won't work.
When we get to Brazil,

131
00:05:55,527 --> 00:05:58,197
we don't have any job prospects,
so we can't make money.

132
00:05:58,263 --> 00:06:00,933
We don't know anyone,
so we won't have a social life.

133
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:04,870
We have to wear a condom when we have sex.
That means no pulling out on girls.

134
00:06:05,971 --> 00:06:06,972
Excuse me.

135
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,907
-I'm so sorry. Please.
-No problem.

136
00:06:08,974 --> 00:06:10,943
Is the morning-after pill
legal down there?

137
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:13,245
All right,
let's take it down a couple of notches.

138
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:15,614
-There's a--
-It's a Catholic country. Picture this.

139
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:18,350
I'm dicking some beautiful Brazilian,
getting confident,

140
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:20,452
I start long-stroking her, boom,
the condom breaks.

141
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:23,255
-There's a baby.
-Can I just go to the pharmacy and get it

142
00:06:23,322 --> 00:06:25,924
or do I have to drop her off
at some unlicensed doctor

143
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:28,894
-to handle it holistically?
-I gotta go. I don't know you. Bye.

144
00:06:28,961 --> 00:06:29,928
-I know you.
-No.

145
00:06:29,995 --> 00:06:32,431
I ask the tough questions,
Chester, and so should you.

146
00:06:32,498 --> 00:06:33,599
I don't know you.

147
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,635
You have a very bright future
ahead of you, Chris.

148
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:38,937
Thank you. I know I do.

149
00:06:45,277 --> 00:06:46,645
Ah. Chris. Dude.

150
00:06:46,912 --> 00:06:48,947
I heard, man.
Let me tell you something.

151
00:06:49,014 --> 00:06:51,416
This shoulder has your name
written all over it.

152
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:53,986
If you need a good cry, man,
let the tears flow--

153
00:06:54,052 --> 00:06:55,254
What are you talking about?

154
00:06:56,188 --> 00:06:59,291
Word got out. Everyone's talking about
how Brooke broke up with you.

155
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:00,559
Let me tell you something.

156
00:07:00,626 --> 00:07:02,661
I have no problem taking
your sloppy seconds.

157
00:07:02,928 --> 00:07:05,164
As a matter of fact,
I prefer your sloppy seconds.

158
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,299
It's like your stamp of approval
on the pussy.

159
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:10,135
This is how you come at me
this early in the morning, Greg?

160
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:12,271
Why don't you ask about
my grandma's dementia?

161

I don't mean for this to sound racist,

173
00:07:47,306 --> 00:07:51,510
Why? It's great. This is fantastic music.
Have you seen Brazilian women dance?

174
00:07:51,577 --> 00:07:54,179
Yeah. "Brazilian"
is my favorite porn search word

175
00:07:54,246 --> 00:07:55,614
before "drunk" and "amateur."

176
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:59,117
I don't know what it is about amateur.
I like it. It's more authentic.

from one of our trucks?

Trucks? I don't...
I don't know what you're talking about.

204

You didn't think I was gonna find out,
did you?

205
00:09:07,386 --> 00:09:09,154
You're carrying a lot of dead weight.

206

That fucking friend of yours, Chris?

207
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,293
He's a bum. Which makes you an idiot,
for being friends with him.

208
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:17,496

he sold it to Organix for--

00:09:17,563 --> 00:09:20,766
How much did he tell you he sold it for,
$3,000? What a great deal.

Wrong.

211
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:25,070
He sold it to Organix for 5 grand.

212

What do you want?

216
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:38,250
You owe $5,000 to the store
for food you stole.

217
00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:41,320
-I don't have that kind of money.
-Then you and Chris are fired.

I couldn't help but notice
your rich Central American accent.

326
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:12,624
It's just so beautiful,
the way it flows off your tongue.

327
00:14:12,691 --> 00:14:13,692
I mean, what is that?

328
00:14:13,758 --> 00:14:16,061
Belize? Nicaraguan? Salvadorean?

329
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:18,396
Let's go a little further down.

330
00:14:18,463 --> 00:14:19,531
We are almost there.

331
00:14:23,568 --> 00:14:25,003
[man whistles, then yells indistinctly]

332
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,671
[indistinct chattering]

333
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:28,073
Shit.

334
00:14:29,674 --> 00:14:31,076
-[cell phone ringing]
-Oh, my boss.

335
00:14:31,142 --> 00:14:33,078
-See? He's such a worrywart.
-Turn it off.

336
00:14:33,144 --> 00:14:36,047
He'll probably send out an amber alert
if I don't check in.

337
00:14:37,082 --> 00:14:39,684
I never know how
to mute these things, actually.

338
00:14:39,985 --> 00:14:41,486
[chuckling]

339
00:14:41,553 --> 00:14:42,654
Okay, yeah.

340
00:14:42,721 --> 00:14:44,022
-Okay, very funny.
-[whistling]

341
00:14:44,456 --> 00:14:46,591
Can we not do this while I drive? Please?

342
00:14:46,658 --> 00:14:49,461
I have a phobia about things
going near my eye. It's-- [gasps]

343
00:14:50,829 --> 00:14:53,698
Please, don't do this, okay?
You want the car, it's your car.

344
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:55,600
I won't tell the cops. Just let me go.

345
00:14:56,101 --> 00:14:57,068
[American accent]
I don't want the car.

346
00:14:57,135 --> 00:14:58,570
See that pink house?

347
00:14:58,637 --> 00:15:01,873
Wait, what happened to your accent?
Why would you fake an accent?

348
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,975
Because it made you feel more comfortable.

349
00:15:04,175 --> 00:15:07,078
That's really a social commentary
on why you're more empathetic

350
00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:11,917
to people who speak with accents.
Now I'm gonna ask you one more time.

351
00:15:12,517 --> 00:15:14,753
You're gonna slowly pull up
to that pink house,

352
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:17,856
and on my cue, you'll drive away fast.

353
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:19,491
Can you do that?

354
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:21,960
You mean the purple one?

355
00:15:22,494 --> 00:15:24,796
-It's pink.
-No, that's more of a mauve if anything.

356
00:15:24,863 --> 00:15:26,498
-It's fucking pink.
-To be honest,

357
00:15:26,564 --> 00:15:28,967
I'm not the best for this job.
I'm a great team leader.

358
00:15:29,034 --> 00:15:30,168
My résumé speaks to that.

359
00:15:30,435 --> 00:15:33,772
But being a getaway driver is not one
of my strong points-- Strong suits.

360
00:15:33,838 --> 00:15:34,773
Is that a yes?

361
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,143
Yes. I'm feeling very spontaneous today.
Let's do it. Yeah.

362
00:15:41,513 --> 00:15:44,549
[man 1] Can't wait for you to see what
I got my mom for Mother's Day, man.

363
00:15:44,616 --> 00:15:46,117
[man 2] I forgot that was coming, blood.

364
00:15:46,184 --> 00:15:47,185
-Damn.
-[man 1] What?

365
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:49,621
-You ain't got Mama something?
-[man 2] No.

366
00:15:50,021 --> 00:15:51,823
Out of all my favorite beaches,

367
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,758
I'm fucking with Hermosa the most, man.

368
00:15:54,225 --> 00:15:56,094
[man 2] Hell, no, nigga. That Caesar.

369
00:15:56,161 --> 00:15:57,662
[man 1] Not pizzas.

370
00:15:57,729 --> 00:16:00,699
-I said, out of all the beaches and shit.
-[man 2] Oh, you said beaches.

371
00:16:00,765 --> 00:16:02,133
[man 1] Yeah. [laughs]

372
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,702
-[man 2] What the hell?
-Blood, my--

373
00:16:03,768 --> 00:16:05,704
Oh. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

374
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:07,505
[man 1] What's cracking, coz?

375
00:16:08,606 --> 00:16:10,842
-What you looking at?
-I ain't never seen that car

376
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:12,077
on the street before.

377
00:16:12,143 --> 00:16:13,511
[Carlo] Now, on my cue,

378
00:16:13,979 --> 00:16:15,213
you pop the trunk.

379
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,848
-Got it?
-Got it.

380
00:16:18,616 --> 00:16:19,484
One.

381
00:16:22,153 --> 00:16:23,254
Two.

382
00:16:28,793 --> 00:16:29,661
Three. Now!

383
00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:37,002
Guatemalan boys say hello!

384
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:39,270
[Carlo laughing]

385
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:45,076
[laughing]

386
00:16:59,257 --> 00:17:00,558
Pull off! Pull off!

387
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:01,993
[tires squealing]

388
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,927
Take that!

389
00:17:04,562 --> 00:17:05,797
[Chester] Oh, God! Oh, God!

390
00:17:05,864 --> 00:17:06,798
Motherfucker!

391
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,669
-Can't this piece of shit go faster?!
-I fucking hate Craigslist!

392
00:17:11,736 --> 00:17:12,937
Go!

393
00:17:13,004 --> 00:17:13,872
[Chester screaming]

394
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,675
Don't slow down.
What the fuck are you doing?

395
00:17:17,742 --> 00:17:19,611
Sorry, Carlo. Just give me one second.

396
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:25,050
I'm sorry about that.

397
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:26,251
I'm sorry.

398
00:17:26,317 --> 00:17:27,218
Oh, God.

399
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:30,722
From now on, when I say "don't pull over,"

400
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:32,223
and you pull over,

401
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:35,226
I am going to consider that disobedience.

402
00:17:35,293 --> 00:17:38,763
And what do you do
when a dog disobeys you?

403
00:17:41,132 --> 00:17:44,302
You put that bitch down.

404
00:17:46,838 --> 00:17:48,073
Now...

405
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:51,676
you're gonna drop us off at our car.

406
00:17:51,743 --> 00:17:53,945
[Rico and Carlo speaking in Spanish]

407
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:58,116
-[in English] Okay.
-Let's go.

408
00:17:59,184 --> 00:18:01,086
[Carlo speaking in Spanish]

409
00:18:01,152 --> 00:18:03,021
[Rico laughing, then Carlo laughing]

410
00:18:04,889 --> 00:18:08,193
[Carlo speaking in Spanish]

411
00:18:10,228 --> 00:18:11,896
[in English]
Whoa. Where are you going?

412
00:18:11,963 --> 00:18:13,031
[Chester] A shortcut.

413
00:18:14,065 --> 00:18:17,068
The streets in L.A. are a death trap,
so, I'm taking the highway.

414
00:18:17,135 --> 00:18:18,870
Trust me, this is the fastest route.

415
00:18:19,337 --> 00:18:20,638
[Carlo] You better be right.

416
00:18:26,211 --> 00:18:29,013
[car horns honking]

417
00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:32,884
[Carlo sighs] Faster, huh?

418
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:35,286
How was I supposed
to know there's construction?

419
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:39,724
You know, they should invent an app
that tells you if a highway's

420
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,193
backed up due to construction,
and how to take detours.

421
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,262
-That's a smart idea. That's--
-That's Waze.

422
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:46,297
You just described
the most popular map app

423
00:18:46,364 --> 00:18:49,267
that was bought by Google
for 1.2 billion dollars.

424
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:52,704
[both speaking in Spanish]

425
00:18:52,937 --> 00:18:54,706
[in English]
One-point-three. <i>Gracias, </i>Rico.

426
00:18:54,772 --> 00:18:58,076
You guys are pretty current
with the, uh, Silicon Valley news.

427
00:18:58,143 --> 00:18:59,878
That's... That's impressive.

428
00:19:00,311 --> 00:19:02,981
We love reading about app mergers.

429
00:19:03,047 --> 00:19:04,282
Get off this exit.

430
00:19:05,283 --> 00:19:06,151
Okay.

431
00:19:07,886 --> 00:19:09,320
Oh, hey, come on, dude.

432
00:19:12,056 --> 00:19:14,259
See this? Typical L.A. driver, man.

433
00:19:14,325 --> 00:19:16,127
-Probably late to his audition.
-[car horn honks]

434
00:19:16,194 --> 00:19:19,364
-Hey, man, easy on the horn.
-[Chester] You're not gonna get the part.

435
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,431
-[car horn honking]
-Come on.

436
00:19:20,698 --> 00:19:22,033
[horn continues honking]

437
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,134
Easy on the horn!

438
00:19:23,201 --> 00:19:25,670
There's a million other actors like you.

439
00:19:25,737 --> 00:19:27,872
-It's not going for you.
-It's not going for me?

440
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:30,942
You know,
I'm driving a V-8 drop-top Bentley.

441
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:33,144
So, yeah, it's going for me pretty well.

442
00:19:33,211 --> 00:19:35,914
What's up with your car?
Is that real leather? Doubt it.

443
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,448
What, is that plastic? [chuckling]

444
00:19:37,715 --> 00:19:39,851
This is a 1997 vintage car.

445
00:19:39,918 --> 00:19:42,787
He thinks he's better than me
'cause he drives imported shit?

446
00:19:42,854 --> 00:19:44,255
When you talk shit about people,

447
00:19:44,322 --> 00:19:47,225
you should roll up your window.
Might have to do it manually.

448
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:48,426
You know, manually?

449
00:19:48,693 --> 00:19:49,394
You know that word?

450
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,929
When you talk shit to someone

451
00:19:50,995 --> 00:19:52,096
-on the freeway,
-Stop.

452
00:19:52,163 --> 00:19:54,732
make sure you're
not driving a $100,000 car!

453
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,000
-I dare you.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

454
00:19:56,968 --> 00:19:58,369
-[banging and glass breaking]
-Fuck!

455
00:19:58,436 --> 00:20:00,371
-You kidding me?
-See what you made me do?

456
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:02,440
-Shit!
-I made you do?

457
00:20:02,707 --> 00:20:04,809
-I'm crazy when I drive.
-Didn't see a car?

458
00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:06,978
-Don't talk shit to someone.
-Out of the car.

459
00:20:07,045 --> 00:20:10,014
-I take melatonin every night.
-Hey, hey, hey! Get in the car!

460
00:20:10,081 --> 00:20:12,784
-[Carlo yelling in Spanish]
-Hey!

461
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,018
What's happening?

[continues yelling in Spanish]

463
00:20:18,256 --> 00:20:19,390

00:20:22,026 --> 00:20:23,361
Fuck. Fuck.

466
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,464
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

467
00:20:27,332 --> 00:20:28,266
Come on.

[dispatcher]<i> 911, what's your emergency?</i>

473
00:21:13,511 --> 00:21:16,381
I was robbed at gunpoint
by two Guatemalans in a pickup truck.

474
00:21:16,447 --> 00:21:18,449
They stole my car
and are trying to kill me.

475
00:21:18,516 --> 00:21:21,419
-<i>Hold, sir. I'll transfer your call.</i>
-No. Don't put me on hold.

476
00:21:21,486 --> 00:21:24,455
-<i>Sir, it'll just be a second.</i>
-No. Don't put me-- [grunts]

477
00:21:24,522 --> 00:21:26,057
Fine. I'm dead.

-Ow!
-[Johnny chuckles]

484
00:21:47,011 --> 00:21:48,479
-You should see--
-What the fuck?

485
00:21:48,546 --> 00:21:50,248
-Piece of shit.
-[laughing]

-You trying to get up?
-Get off!

-You trying to get up? [whoops]
-Get out of my room!

495
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,944
-You look like a paraplegic. Doesn't he?
-Yeah, he does.

496
00:22:20,378 --> 00:22:21,379
You mean quadriplegic?

497
00:22:21,446 --> 00:22:23,481
Paraplegic has nothing to do
with the face.

498
00:22:23,548 --> 00:22:25,116
Oh. "You mean quadriplegic?

499
00:22:25,183 --> 00:22:27,418
Paraplegic has nothing
to do with the face."

500
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,353
[blowing raspberry]

501
00:22:30,455 --> 00:22:31,489
[Johnny] Holy shit.

502
00:22:32,156 --> 00:22:35,093
Are you seeing this spot-on impression
Patti's doing of you?

503
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:38,129
I'm seeing double over here.
Nicely done, Patti. Keep it coming.

504
00:22:38,563 --> 00:22:39,864
[chuckles] So...

505
00:22:40,331 --> 00:22:42,533
another glorious day at work
coming for you, huh?

506
00:22:43,868 --> 00:22:46,571
You psyched
to break down cardboard boxes,

507
00:22:46,637 --> 00:22:49,474
and stock the shelves with cans all day?

508
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,142
Get a high-protein breakfast in.

509
00:22:51,209 --> 00:22:53,211
Don't run out of steam,
all that hard labor.

510
00:22:53,277 --> 00:22:56,247
You learned sarcasm at the ripe age of 35.
Good for you, Johnny.

511
00:22:56,314 --> 00:22:58,983
Just move out and get a real job.
No one wants you here.

512
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,652
Why don't you get a real job?
I'll get one when you get one.

513
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,988
I'm a diabetic, asshole.

514
00:23:04,055 --> 00:23:07,525
-I have to live with Mom and Dad.
-How's the tallboy treating your diabetes?

515
00:23:07,592 --> 00:23:09,460
[beeper beeping]

516
00:23:09,527 --> 00:23:10,394
Hold that thought.

517
00:23:10,595 --> 00:23:12,597
[sniffles] Whoops.

518
00:23:12,997 --> 00:23:14,065
I just made 300 bucks.

519
00:23:14,132 --> 00:23:15,133
What are you scalping?

520
00:23:15,533 --> 00:23:18,970
-Strokes tickets at the Greek.
-Are they even real?

521
00:23:19,937 --> 00:23:22,540
Yeah, they're totally real.
They're Ticketmaster approved.

522
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:25,042
[mimics crying, then explosion]

523
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:26,544
-All over your face.
-Is that what

524
00:23:26,611 --> 00:23:29,013
-you sound like when you're coming?
-Yeah.

525
00:23:30,047 --> 00:23:32,950
[beeper beeping] Excuse me.
You wanna go to that Rock the Bells show?

526
00:23:33,017 --> 00:23:34,452
I got two tickets I gotta unload.

527
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:37,054
But it was sold out four months ago.
How much?

528
00:23:37,121 --> 00:23:37,989
For you?

529
00:23:38,055 --> 00:23:38,923
Brotherly price.

530
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,191
[clicking tongue]

531
00:23:40,258 --> 00:23:41,192
Three hundred bucks.

532
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:44,095
Come on. I can't afford that.
Just give 'em to me for free.

533
00:23:44,162 --> 00:23:46,397
Check Craigslist.
These are going for 800 minimum.

534
00:23:46,464 --> 00:23:49,267
-But your tickets are fake.
-The concert's gonna be so huge,

535
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,469
you just show up,
they'll glance at your ticket,

536
00:23:51,536 --> 00:23:52,537
and let you go in.

537
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,106
This is my area of expertise now.

538
00:23:55,173 --> 00:23:57,642
If I wanted to know the price
on some shitty meat

539
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:59,076
in the meat market,

540
00:23:59,477 --> 00:24:00,711
I'd probably ask you.

541
00:24:01,145 --> 00:24:02,280
[sniffles, then clears throat]

542
00:24:02,346 --> 00:24:05,983
-'Cause that's your profession, dipshit.
-I'll give you 100 for two.

543
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,385
Blow my dick with your mouth.

544
00:24:08,052 --> 00:24:09,053
You hear that, Patti?

545
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,556
-Johnny wants me to suck his dick.
-Chris. Language.

546
00:24:11,622 --> 00:24:15,226
Watch what you say in front of Patti,
you disrespectful cunt.

547
00:24:15,293 --> 00:24:16,661
-[music playing over speaker]
-[Johnny] Oh, shit.

548
00:24:16,727 --> 00:24:19,030
Oh, shit. We're nailing this.

549
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:21,098
Oh, my God. Yeah.

550
00:24:21,165 --> 00:24:22,099
We're in the pocket.

551
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:23,734
So snug.

552
00:24:24,001 --> 00:24:25,703
[safe beeping]

553
00:24:36,147 --> 00:24:38,182
[music continues playing]

554
00:24:38,983 --> 00:24:40,685
-Perfect. Perfect so far.
-[car horn honking]

555
00:24:40,751 --> 00:24:41,619
What is that?

556
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,354
Shut up!

557
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,358
Wait. Okay. All right.
Pause it, pause it, pause it.

558
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:50,761
Come on. What was that?
We were having a perfect game.

559
00:24:51,028 --> 00:24:54,065
Oh, the idiot.
Your drumming was incredible, by the way.

560
00:24:54,131 --> 00:24:56,567
Keep up that intensity when we unpause.
Hey, Chris!

561
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,338
Chris!

562
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:05,509
Your dyke friend's here
to pick you up in his dogshit car.

563
00:25:05,576 --> 00:25:07,445
Tell him to stop honking his whack horn.

564
00:25:07,511 --> 00:25:09,580
He's ruining our game. Wait.

565
00:25:16,454 --> 00:25:17,555
Were you in my room?

566
00:25:17,622 --> 00:25:19,323
No, you paranoid fuck.

567
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,026
-Stay out of my shit.
-Nobody's in your shit, Johnny.

568
00:25:22,093 --> 00:25:24,662
You're poking around in my shit.

569
00:25:25,296 --> 00:25:26,631
[whispering]
And I don't like it.

570
00:25:27,231 --> 00:25:30,568
You're sniffing around...
[sniffing] sniffing my shit.

571
00:25:30,635 --> 00:25:32,403
-Why are you whispering?
-Why are you?

572
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,238
-You are.
-You sniffing around my shit

573
00:25:34,305 --> 00:25:35,706
-makes me so mad.
-Don't worry.

574
00:25:35,773 --> 00:25:36,807
-Out of my shit.
-Stop.

575
00:25:37,074 --> 00:25:39,043
-Stay out of my shit.
-Stop whispering.

576
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,545
-I'm not whispering. You are.
-I'm not whispering.

577
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,048
You stay out of my shit.

578
00:25:44,115 --> 00:25:46,284
-Stop it.
-Stay out of my shit.

579
00:25:47,785 --> 00:25:48,653
Bye, Patti.

580
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,288
Fuck you.

581
00:25:50,354 --> 00:25:51,222
Come on.

582
00:25:52,823 --> 00:25:53,824
All right, Patti.

583
00:25:54,492 --> 00:25:55,760
Sack up, we're going back in.

584
00:25:57,361 --> 00:25:59,697
-Feels like the game's cheating, right?
-Yeah, it is.

585
00:25:59,764 --> 00:26:01,132
I'm gonna sue Xbox.

586
00:26:01,198 --> 00:26:02,466
[Chester speaking in Portuguese]

587
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:03,434
Let's go, let's go!

588
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:07,138
Cool. Hey, don't slam the door.

589
00:26:07,538 --> 00:26:10,174
-Don't slam the--
-What the fuck are you listening to?

590
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:12,576
I'm not going to a concert
with his fake tickets.

591
00:26:12,643 --> 00:26:14,679
Sell 'em
and get your car out of the impound.

592
00:26:14,745 --> 00:26:16,647
-Grow up.
-[woman] <i>You have a very bright future</i>

593
00:26:16,714 --> 00:26:18,182
ahead of you, Chris.

594
00:26:18,249 --> 00:26:20,818
This is how you come at me
this early in the morning, Greg?

595
00:26:21,085 --> 00:26:23,154
Why don't you ask about
my grandma's dementia?

596
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,257
Dude, that was rude of me.
Too early for that, you're right. My B.

597
00:26:26,324 --> 00:26:27,858
You wanna hear something messed up?

598
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:30,394
I got two tickets
to Rock the Bells going to waste.

599
00:26:30,461 --> 00:26:32,196
That's 500 bucks down the drain.

600
00:26:32,263 --> 00:26:34,231
Two? I've been looking all over for those.

601
00:26:34,298 --> 00:26:36,500
-I checked StubHub and everything. 500?
-Here.

602
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:38,402
That's way too much. I won't touch 'em

603
00:26:38,469 --> 00:26:41,739
-until you give me a better price.
-I mean, I can do it for you for 300.

604
00:26:41,806 --> 00:26:42,840
-Three hundred?
-Yeah.

605
00:26:43,107 --> 00:26:44,108
Oh, shit.

606
00:26:47,812 --> 00:26:50,181
-Yo, what--? Yo, what the fuck?
-What?

607
00:26:50,648 --> 00:26:52,516
Why you trying to sell me fake tickets?

608
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:54,118
-What?
-I thought we were cool.

609
00:26:54,185 --> 00:26:55,486
I just took you to Jamba Juice

610
00:26:55,553 --> 00:26:58,222
and bought you a ginger shot.
Ginger shots aren't cheap.

611
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:01,125
You think I'm the ginger fairy?
Like ginger grows on trees?

612
00:27:01,192 --> 00:27:03,527
Out of all people,
I know how much ginger shots cost.

613
00:27:03,594 --> 00:27:06,230
It's an expensive addition to a smoothie.
I get that.

614
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:09,367
I'm just trying to sell you great tickets
to an amazing event.

615
00:27:09,433 --> 00:27:11,135
I feel like Jesus over here.

616
00:27:11,202 --> 00:27:13,738
I'm trying to give you something
and I'm being persecuted.

617
00:27:13,804 --> 00:27:16,407
Really? Jesus was scalping tickets
for the Last Supper?

618
00:27:16,474 --> 00:27:18,743
If you don't want 'em, good.
Deal's off. Forget it.

619
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:22,546
Those are fake. I know they are.
The real ones have a security foil on 'em.

620
00:27:22,613 --> 00:27:23,714
Those aren't real.

621
00:27:23,781 --> 00:27:25,716
Real or fake, no one's gonna give a shit.

622
00:27:25,783 --> 00:27:28,853
There'll be so many people there,
security's just gonna let you in.

623
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:31,655
Do I look like a sucker-ass nigga?
Don't answer that.

624
00:27:31,722 --> 00:27:34,191
Two friends got caught
with fake tickets last year.

625
00:27:34,258 --> 00:27:35,292
Security did them in.

626
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:38,295
My first friend, broken leg.
He can't even walk right now.

627
00:27:38,362 --> 00:27:39,563
Second friend, dead.

628
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,533
I don't know your friends.
They might have weak immune systems.

629
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,467
I gotta go.

630
00:27:45,236 --> 00:27:46,570
-[Chester] Why?
-I think he's nervous

631
00:27:46,637 --> 00:27:48,539
about that divisional manager guy
stopping by.

632
00:27:49,473 --> 00:27:54,612
Check this out. Look. "Wuz really hood?
Two VIP tix, 3 hundo, far form the crowd."

633
00:27:54,678 --> 00:27:57,481
-I think he meant "from."
-[Chester] Go pack, get your passport.

634
00:27:57,548 --> 00:27:59,850
We'll fly standby if we have to,
but we leave today.

635
00:27:59,917 --> 00:28:02,386
-But I don't have a ride. Shit.
-Cover my register!

636
00:28:02,453 --> 00:28:04,688
[cell phone ringing]

637
00:28:05,322 --> 00:28:06,624
Maloney's my name. Talk to me.

638
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,693
-[man] <i>Yo, you called me about tickets?</i>
-Yeah, yeah. You still got 'em?

639
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,430
<i>Yeah, I got 'em.</i>
<i>Don't call me on that sexy voice shit.</i>

640
00:28:12,496 --> 00:28:15,566
<i>Three hundred for both of 'em</i>
<i>and don't come here on some bullshit.</i>

641
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:16,500
Where do you live?

642
00:28:16,567 --> 00:28:18,803
<i>Valley. 450 Vesper off Ventura.</i>
<i>Don't be late.</i>

643
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:20,805
-I'll see you in an hour.
-<i>Yeah. Hurry up.</i>

644
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:23,607
I'm so sorry.
Our card machine's actually not working.

645
00:28:23,674 --> 00:28:24,942
Do you have cash?

646
00:28:26,977 --> 00:28:28,612
[groans] Sorry.

647
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,815
Those eyes got me. [chuckles]

648
00:28:31,982 --> 00:28:33,284
Thank you so much.

649
00:28:36,821 --> 00:28:37,722
What are you doing?

650
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:40,925
Nothing. Yo, if Danny asks for me,
I'm going to get lunch.

651
00:28:41,726 --> 00:28:42,827
It's not even 9:30.

652
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,735
[Chris] Five,

653
00:28:50,801 --> 00:28:52,436
six,

654
00:28:52,503 --> 00:28:53,671
seven...

655
00:28:54,739 --> 00:28:55,606
Eight hundred.

656
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,425
[sighs] What's up, baby?

657
00:29:14,825 --> 00:29:16,694
What's up, baby? It's all good, brother.

658
00:29:16,761 --> 00:29:17,795
It's all good, baby.

659
00:29:17,862 --> 00:29:19,497
He's not Maloney. You're Maloney.

660
00:29:19,563 --> 00:29:20,965
Be fucking Maloney.

661
00:29:28,405 --> 00:29:30,274
Is that your black Range Rover outside?

662
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,577
That's Jay's.

663
00:29:34,712 --> 00:29:35,579
Cool.

664
00:29:37,581 --> 00:29:40,751
I'm just wondering, 'cause,
like, I'm in the market for one, so...

665
00:29:41,418 --> 00:29:44,688
Like, that or a Lambo.
Just something to fit my character.

666
00:29:52,062 --> 00:29:53,931
Just-- Just stop talking.

667
00:29:54,698 --> 00:29:56,400
-[moaning on computer]
-[Jay] One.

668
00:29:56,467 --> 00:29:57,601
Two.

669
00:29:57,668 --> 00:29:58,836
Three.

670
00:29:58,903 --> 00:30:00,070
Four.

671
00:30:00,337 --> 00:30:01,305
Five.

672
00:30:01,372 --> 00:30:02,473
Six.

673
00:30:02,973 --> 00:30:04,942
[grunting]

674
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:07,645
-[woman] Jay!
-Fuck you. [grunts]

675
00:30:07,711 --> 00:30:10,447
-Jay, get the fuck out here!
-Goddamn it.

676
00:30:11,782 --> 00:30:13,818
-[door slams]
-Hey, yo, what the fuck did I say?

677
00:30:13,884 --> 00:30:16,854
When that door's closed,
don't bother me, don't text me.

678
00:30:16,921 --> 00:30:19,323
-Nothing.
-[scoffs]

679
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,058
Hey, yo, hand me that robe real quick.

680
00:30:22,393 --> 00:30:23,494
Oh, yeah.

681
00:30:25,362 --> 00:30:27,665
-Put that on, ma'am.
-Do I look fucking cold to you?

682
00:30:29,567 --> 00:30:30,434
[scoffs]

683
00:30:30,601 --> 00:30:31,569
Whatever.

684
00:30:31,635 --> 00:30:33,003
What the fuck you looking at?

685
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:33,938
Nothing.

686
00:30:34,438 --> 00:30:37,708
-I'm just here for the tickets.
-Oh, you that silly motherfucker

687
00:30:37,775 --> 00:30:40,778
that called me with the sexy-ass voice.
Yo, last two I got, man.

688
00:30:41,378 --> 00:30:44,014
Don't fucking put
your sausage fingerprints all over them.

689
00:30:44,081 --> 00:30:45,883
All right? It depreciates the value.

690
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:49,386
Are these really VIP?
I mean, I know it says it on the tickets,

691
00:30:49,453 --> 00:30:51,755
but there's a lot of,
like, fake VIPs going around--

692
00:30:51,822 --> 00:30:52,690
Oh, okay.

693
00:30:53,591 --> 00:30:56,560
I bet you think all Asian people bootleg

694
00:30:56,627 --> 00:30:59,430
DVDs, Louis bags, concert tickets?

695
00:30:59,496 --> 00:31:02,099
Racist motherfucker.
Get out of here. Give my tickets back.

696
00:31:02,366 --> 00:31:03,934
I've never bought a fake Louis bag,

697
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:07,438
so, I wouldn't know what the ethnicity
of that person would be, really.

698
00:31:07,504 --> 00:31:08,405
I don't-- You know?

699
00:31:08,706 --> 00:31:10,741
I've heard it's a specific type.

700
00:31:11,141 --> 00:31:12,142
No, no. No, no.

701
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,978
I just, you know...

702
00:31:16,447 --> 00:31:18,482
-No.
-[chuckles]

703
00:31:19,817 --> 00:31:21,719
What the fuck are you laughing at?

704
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,755
Yo, what's your problem?

705
00:31:24,822 --> 00:31:26,423
You really want me to say it?

706
00:31:28,993 --> 00:31:32,096
Every time we say we're gonna...

707
00:31:34,565 --> 00:31:35,966
you have something going on.

708
00:31:36,567 --> 00:31:39,069
-What's the Wi-Fi here?
-I don't take care of that pussy?

709
00:31:39,136 --> 00:31:40,604
It's okay. I have LTE.

710
00:31:40,704 --> 00:31:41,872
[scoffs]

711
00:31:41,939 --> 00:31:44,608
Okay. Yeah, you start some shit,
but you can't finish it

712
00:31:44,675 --> 00:31:47,544
when shit gets real, right? You scared.

713
00:31:47,611 --> 00:31:48,579
You scared, right?

714
00:31:49,046 --> 00:31:50,915
Jay, I'm not the one that's scared.

715
00:31:50,981 --> 00:31:52,750
Now get the fuck out of my way.

716
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:55,052
You touch me again, we have a problem.

717
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:57,755
-Hey, hey, take it easy.
-Get the fuck off of me.

718
00:31:57,821 --> 00:31:59,657
-Asshole.
-Let's try Ujjayi breathing.

719
00:31:59,723 --> 00:32:02,026
Inhale through the nose,
exhale through the mouth,

720
00:32:02,092 --> 00:32:03,994
-like to fog up a window.
-[cell phone rings]

721
00:32:04,061 --> 00:32:06,530
-Can I use your bathroom?
-Yo, down the hall, man.

722
00:32:07,831 --> 00:32:09,166
What the fuck do you want?

723
00:32:15,005 --> 00:32:15,873
[lock clicks]

724
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:28,185
What's up, baby? What's up?

725
00:32:28,452 --> 00:32:31,088
-Ain't shit. Fuck him. Fuck him.
-[banging on door]

726
00:32:31,155 --> 00:32:33,490
-Yo, what's up, man?
-[Jay] Yo, what you doing in there?

727
00:32:33,557 --> 00:32:36,460
-I'm just finishing up.
-I gotta bounce, so, hurry the fuck up.

728
00:32:39,163 --> 00:32:42,466
Make sure he pays for the tickets.
I gotta drop this off real quick.

729
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,035
Hey, yo.
Make sure he pays for the tickets.

730
00:32:45,102 --> 00:32:46,036
I'm talking to you.

731
00:32:46,103 --> 00:32:47,972
I heard you the first time. Jesus.

732
00:32:48,038 --> 00:32:51,075
-What did I just say to do?
-I'll get him to pay for the tickets.

733
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:52,977
Great.

734
00:32:53,911 --> 00:32:56,213
Thank you for treating me
like a fucking adult. [grunts]

735
00:32:56,914 --> 00:32:57,815
[groans]

736
00:32:57,881 --> 00:32:58,849
[water runs, then stops]

737
00:33:13,998 --> 00:33:15,833
Oh, what the fuck?

738
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,901
Oh, shit.

739
00:33:33,751 --> 00:33:35,619
What the fuck?

740
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,064
Where's Jay?

741
00:33:47,131 --> 00:33:49,666
He had to step out.
You want these tickets?

742
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,037
Uh... Yeah,
I just actually got a call from work,

743
00:33:53,103 --> 00:33:55,205
-and I gotta work the double.
-That sucks.

744
00:33:56,807 --> 00:33:59,810
I was just kidding what I said before
about the Lambo thing.

745
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:02,146
What?

746
00:34:02,813 --> 00:34:03,947
Remember when I was like,

747
00:34:04,081 --> 00:34:07,818
"Oh, I wanna get a Range Rover or a Lambo
or something that'd fit my character."

748
00:34:07,885 --> 00:34:09,086
I was just kidding.

749
00:34:09,153 --> 00:34:10,988
I would never buy any of those cars.

750
00:34:11,055 --> 00:34:14,591
Not 'cause I think they're douchey,
just 'cause, like, I can't afford 'em.

751
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,294
Kind of a douche already.

752
00:34:20,798 --> 00:34:21,965
Did you laugh?

753
00:34:23,567 --> 00:34:24,835
Pretty sure that was a laugh.

754
00:34:24,935 --> 00:34:25,869
[chuckles]

755
00:34:25,936 --> 00:34:28,338
See, I'm not that bad
when you give me a chance, right?

756
00:34:30,074 --> 00:34:31,041
Um...

757
00:34:31,108 --> 00:34:33,277
So, are you gonna go
to the concert later or...?

758
00:34:33,977 --> 00:34:36,747
Uh... I don't know.
I might go with one of my girls.

759
00:34:37,714 --> 00:34:39,249
You should give me a call if you do.

760
00:34:42,086 --> 00:34:42,953
Um...

761
00:34:51,595 --> 00:34:52,796
I saw this in a movie once.

762
00:34:53,764 --> 00:34:56,867
-What happened after?
-He gets killed by her boyfriend.

763
00:34:57,334 --> 00:34:59,636
Fingers crossed
it works out better for you.

764
00:35:03,841 --> 00:35:05,843
[Danny] <i>Could've used a little more luck</i>
<i>last night.</i>

765
00:35:05,909 --> 00:35:08,145
-I'll say that much for sure.
-[man] <i>No fucking kidding.</i>

766
00:35:08,212 --> 00:35:11,248
Dodgers had to break their winning streak
the night I bet on them.

767
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:13,817
Fucking bullshit, but whatever.
Win some, lose some.

768
00:35:13,884 --> 00:35:16,386
<i>Yeah, you're shit out of luck.</i>
<i>I'll be there in an hour.</i>

769
00:35:16,653 --> 00:35:18,222
Oh, word, you're coming over, bro?

770
00:35:18,288 --> 00:35:20,257
-Can you bring me, like, a baggie?
-<i>Baggie?</i>

771
00:35:20,324 --> 00:35:21,792
<i>You got my three racks, fool?</i>

772
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:24,361
I got so many racks,
I ought to open a Home Depot.

773
00:35:24,628 --> 00:35:26,196
-Feel me?
-<i>Yeah, we'll see about that.</i>

774
00:35:27,764 --> 00:35:28,632
Shit.

775
00:35:32,903 --> 00:35:35,372
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

776
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:36,406
Shit.

777
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:40,978
[Danny]<i> Come on, man. Don't-- Shit.</i>

778
00:35:41,044 --> 00:35:42,279
<i>Jay, don't--</i>

779
00:35:42,346 --> 00:35:43,780
<i>Come on, don't do this, bro.</i>

780
00:36:11,808 --> 00:36:13,210
Fucking economy's bullshit.

781
00:36:13,277 --> 00:36:14,745
Jay, hey.

782
00:36:14,912 --> 00:36:16,747
I didn't know you were coming so soon.

783
00:36:16,813 --> 00:36:17,681
That's, uh...

784
00:36:17,814 --> 00:36:19,983
Anybody ever tell you
you're really prompt?

785
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,985
It's a great quality. It's a great, good.

786
00:36:22,052 --> 00:36:23,987
Means you're considerate and, like,

787
00:36:24,054 --> 00:36:26,390
that means that you must come from,
like, you know...

788
00:36:26,957 --> 00:36:30,327
You must've been raised
in a really nice family.

789
00:36:30,394 --> 00:36:33,163
You know? You gotta come from good stock.

790
00:36:37,868 --> 00:36:39,236
Let's do business now.

791
00:36:39,303 --> 00:36:41,271
So, that's all you. That's--

792
00:36:41,338 --> 00:36:42,739
That's you right there.

793
00:36:44,007 --> 00:36:45,142
What the fuck is that?

794
00:36:45,209 --> 00:36:46,443
I know, I know.

795
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:50,214
It's-- That's-- It's for the coke.
And I was gonna pay you the $3,000 later.

796
00:36:50,847 --> 00:36:53,917
So, let me get this straight,
'cause maybe I'm a little slow today.

797
00:36:54,184 --> 00:36:57,487
You expect me to drive all the way
back from the valley

798
00:36:57,754 --> 00:37:00,424
to get the rest of my money,
you delinquent fuck?

799
00:37:01,024 --> 00:37:03,794
You know what?
You're taking the 405, that's the problem.

800
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,895
If you take Coldwater--

801
00:37:04,962 --> 00:37:07,764
You're telling me my problem
is I'm using my Waze app wrong?

802
00:37:09,399 --> 00:37:11,868
You know what happens
when you don't have my money?

803
00:37:11,935 --> 00:37:14,972
Yes, I remember very clearly.
Looks like I have a C-section scar.

804
00:37:15,038 --> 00:37:16,240
Thanks for that.

805
00:37:16,306 --> 00:37:18,175
So, I'm gonna ask you one more time.

806
00:37:19,743 --> 00:37:22,312
Do you have all my motherfucking money?

807
00:37:22,379 --> 00:37:25,749
Yes, I do. Not now.
But I will have it later.

808
00:37:25,816 --> 00:37:27,751
I have a lot of things moving around now,

809
00:37:27,818 --> 00:37:31,488
and I will have it by 1:00 at the latest.

810
00:37:32,422 --> 00:37:33,757
Swear to God.

811
00:37:34,791 --> 00:37:35,459
Latest.

812
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,327
One o'clock.

813
00:37:41,932 --> 00:37:43,834
Did I say 1? I meant 12.

814
00:37:44,301 --> 00:37:46,203
At the latest, 11...

815
00:37:47,504 --> 00:37:48,538
thirty.

816
00:37:49,072 --> 00:37:50,307
Or now.

817
00:37:50,374 --> 00:37:52,943
Let me get--
I'm gonna get you some money right now.

818
00:37:54,077 --> 00:37:54,945
Yeah?

819
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,249
Want a Kombucha, or something?
Hook you up? You good?

820
00:38:01,785 --> 00:38:03,153
[Greg] Next customer in line, please.

821
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:06,390
-All right, you got your--
-This register is closed. Take this stuff.

822
00:38:06,456 --> 00:38:08,358
-Go, go. Go away.
-Hey, Danny. What's up?

823
00:38:08,425 --> 00:38:11,428
Aisle Three needs some extra fifties
and singles and shit.

824
00:38:11,495 --> 00:38:14,998
-Okay. Let me tally up this register.
-No, just give me whatever's there.

825
00:38:15,065 --> 00:38:17,034
Doesn't matter. I'll count in the office.

826
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,136
-Want the change?
-No, I don't need change.

827
00:38:19,202 --> 00:38:21,872
The only change I'd like is
in your damn attitude.

828
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,541
-Okay.
-[mouths] <i>What?</i>

829
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:28,545
[Danny] <i>Brooke, tally up the receipts,</i>
<i>except Greg's, I just took money out.</i>

830
00:38:28,812 --> 00:38:30,881
-Okay, calm down.
-You calm down. I'm calm.

831
00:38:30,947 --> 00:38:33,050
I'm calm as a motherfucking cucumber.

832
00:38:34,851 --> 00:38:35,519
Eight hundred.

833
00:38:37,054 --> 00:38:37,921
Nine hundred.

834
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,925
Thousand. I got a thousand dollars.

835
00:38:41,992 --> 00:38:44,227
That's a thousand dollars for you
right here.

836
00:38:45,095 --> 00:38:45,962
Stand up.

837
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,365
-Why? Come on.
-Stand the fuck up.

838
00:38:48,432 --> 00:38:52,002
-I got $1000 for you. Don't do this.
-Stand the fuck up. Get the fuck up.

839
00:38:52,069 --> 00:38:54,938
I took the old-school SATs.
You know the 1600 one?

840
00:38:55,005 --> 00:38:57,474
That's really good, man.
I didn't even take the SATs.

841
00:38:57,541 --> 00:39:01,378
I bet your ass thinks I got
a perfect 800 score in math, right?

842
00:39:01,445 --> 00:39:04,214
No, I don't-- I didn't think anything.
Man, I'm colorblind

843
00:39:04,281 --> 00:39:07,084
when it comes to stereotypes.
I thought you were Lithuanian.

844
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,218
Here's our options.

845
00:39:08,285 --> 00:39:11,521
A, maybe I'm not good at math,
and this is my fault.

846
00:39:11,588 --> 00:39:12,522
-Or, B,
-Ow.

847
00:39:12,589 --> 00:39:15,859
you're really good at math,
and you'll teach me something new today

848
00:39:15,926 --> 00:39:19,196
and give me a reason why I shouldn't
shoot one of your fucking nuts off.

849
00:39:19,262 --> 00:39:21,598
-Now, how much did I say you owe me?
-Three thousand.

850
00:39:21,865 --> 00:39:23,633
And how much do you have on you right now?

851
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,601
Well, a thousand.

852
00:39:25,268 --> 00:39:27,170
No. Don't do that, man. Give me an hour.

853
00:39:27,237 --> 00:39:29,906
You know I'm good for it.
You know I'm good for it, bro.

854
00:39:32,275 --> 00:39:33,143
An hour.

855
00:39:39,182 --> 00:39:41,351
[Danny] <i>Just give me three grand.</i>
<i>What's the big deal?</i>

856
00:39:41,418 --> 00:39:43,120
I know you need it. I need it more.

857
00:39:43,587 --> 00:39:46,323
I'm not--
No, I'm not gambling again, you idiot.

858
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:49,025
I'll pay you back.
All right, forget it. Fuck you, Ma.

859
00:39:49,092 --> 00:39:51,661
Hope you like retirement homes.
That's where I'll send you.

860
00:39:51,928 --> 00:39:54,598
What's up, Jay? You got a problem?
You got a problem with me?

861
00:39:55,098 --> 00:39:56,199
I don't got your cash.

862
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,468
So, what you gonna do? Yeah.

863
00:39:58,535 --> 00:40:01,004
That's what I thought, man.

864
00:40:01,071 --> 00:40:02,939
[grunting]

865
00:40:04,508 --> 00:40:07,344
[grunting]

866
00:40:07,511 --> 00:40:10,347
[man speaking indistinctly over TV]
[continues grunting]

867
00:40:12,682 --> 00:40:13,984
Fuck.

868
00:40:15,218 --> 00:40:18,288
-Oh! God. Are you serious?
-What's up, girl?

869
00:40:19,055 --> 00:40:22,692
Just getting a late morning workout in.
Sit down, make yourself comfortable.

870
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:26,530
I'm good. You told me to remind you that
Carey Winters is stopping by tomorrow.

871
00:40:26,596 --> 00:40:27,664
So, I'm reminding you.

872
00:40:27,931 --> 00:40:30,300
Fuck Carey Winters!
Cat thinks he can come around

873
00:40:30,367 --> 00:40:34,104
whenever he wants
to check up on me like I'm a little boy.

874
00:40:34,438 --> 00:40:35,972
This boy's all grown up!

875
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:38,408
-That's great. I'll see you later.
-Oh, Brooke.

876
00:40:39,976 --> 00:40:42,679
Do you have $3,000 I can borrow?

877
00:40:42,946 --> 00:40:44,981
I'm 19 and I work here.

878
00:40:45,048 --> 00:40:47,217
Do you know anybody who has it?

879
00:40:47,284 --> 00:40:49,986
-A bank.
-Fucking funny. Get the fuck out.

880
00:40:50,053 --> 00:40:51,421
-My pleasure.
-Hey, Brooke.

881
00:40:53,056 --> 00:40:55,025
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

882
00:40:55,425 --> 00:40:58,128
[inhales deeply, then exhales]
I'm under a lot of pressure.

883
00:40:59,129 --> 00:41:02,132
[woman]<i> I have a big family that loves</i>
<i>to eat. That's why we shop at Organix.</i>

884
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:04,668
{\an8}<i>They've got low prices</i>
<i>and weekly specials.</i>

885
00:41:06,002 --> 00:41:08,138
{\an8}<i>All of their food is sourced</i>
<i>from local farmers.</i>

886
00:41:09,673 --> 00:41:11,241
Brooke, could you be a princess

887
00:41:11,308 --> 00:41:14,110
and go tell Chester to come in here
and see me, please?

888
00:41:15,445 --> 00:41:16,680
<i>Organix.</i>

889
00:41:17,113 --> 00:41:19,282
<i>They're not just a name, they stand by it.</i>

890
00:41:20,183 --> 00:41:21,518
-Danny wants to see you.
-Why?

891
00:41:21,585 --> 00:41:22,752
I don't have that money.

892
00:41:23,019 --> 00:41:24,688
-Then you and Chris are fired.
-No.

893
00:41:24,754 --> 00:41:27,424
No, no, no.
I'm selling my car in half an hour.

894
00:41:27,491 --> 00:41:29,092
It's yours. That's all I've got.

895
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:31,495
All right. That'll do in the meantime.

896
00:41:38,201 --> 00:41:39,236
-Where you been?
-Chris.

897
00:41:40,237 --> 00:41:42,639
-I've been texting you for an hour.
-We need a-- Okay.

898
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:44,341
I just had my car stolen, man.

899
00:41:44,407 --> 00:41:48,011
-What? Who'd wanna steal that bucket?
-I don't know. He didn't give a reason

900
00:41:48,078 --> 00:41:50,413
before he forced me
to be an accessory in a drive-by.

901
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,782
We gotta get out before Danny sees me,
so, let's go.

902
00:41:53,049 --> 00:41:54,017
Before we do that,

903
00:41:54,084 --> 00:41:56,152
I got something
I know is gonna cheer you up.

904
00:41:56,786 --> 00:41:59,422
Con--?
I can't go to a concert right now, man.

905
00:41:59,489 --> 00:42:01,358
I just lost my car,

906
00:42:01,424 --> 00:42:03,226
all my-- All my stuff.

907
00:42:03,326 --> 00:42:06,029
-All my stuff.
-No, no. Listen. I bought us real tickets.

908
00:42:06,096 --> 00:42:06,763
And we're just...

909
00:42:07,464 --> 00:42:09,332
We're not gonna go to Brazil right now.

910
00:42:09,399 --> 00:42:11,234
How did you get money for the tickets?

911
00:42:11,301 --> 00:42:13,336
Don't worry about that.
These are paid for.

912
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,508
Yeah. Fine. Fuck it, let's go.

913
00:42:18,575 --> 00:42:19,709
-I love you.
-Whoa, okay.

914
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:21,444
Wow.

915
00:42:21,511 --> 00:42:22,546
Okay, we get the joke.

916
00:42:23,213 --> 00:42:24,381
Don't be homophobic.

917
00:42:32,355 --> 00:42:33,223
Huh.

918
00:42:34,591 --> 00:42:35,458
[knocking on door]

919
00:42:36,793 --> 00:42:38,361
I'm working. Go away.

920
00:42:39,362 --> 00:42:41,164
[knocking on door]

921
00:42:41,231 --> 00:42:42,098
Fuck.

922
00:42:45,769 --> 00:42:46,636
Danny.

923
00:42:46,703 --> 00:42:48,104
Long time. How are you?

924
00:42:48,171 --> 00:42:50,073
Ah. Mr. Winters.

925
00:42:51,575 --> 00:42:52,776
What, are you a germophobe?

926
00:42:52,842 --> 00:42:55,445
-A little. Little bit, yeah.
-[laughs] I like it, I like it.

927
00:42:55,512 --> 00:42:58,248
You never know who's
carrying around hepatitis, right?

928
00:42:58,315 --> 00:43:01,217
Yeah. Listen,
I'm sorry to drop in on you like this,

929
00:43:01,284 --> 00:43:03,587
but they changed my itinerary last-minute.

930
00:43:03,653 --> 00:43:05,455
I just got off a plane an hour ago,

931
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,725
-came straight here.
-I wasn't expecting you till tomorrow.

932
00:43:09,326 --> 00:43:10,594
It's a bad time?

933
00:43:11,261 --> 00:43:12,128
Yes.

934
00:43:13,129 --> 00:43:14,731
[both laughing]

935
00:43:14,798 --> 00:43:16,399
[Chris] Buy a shirt for the concert.

936
00:43:16,466 --> 00:43:18,368
-You look like shit.
-[Chester] I don't understand

937
00:43:18,435 --> 00:43:20,704
why we can't just go back
to your brother's place.

938
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:23,106
'Cause Johnny's gonna murder me
when he sees me.

939
00:43:23,173 --> 00:43:25,875
Luckily I've had this shirt
in my trunk for the last two years.

940
00:43:26,142 --> 00:43:27,444
-[Chester] Mm.
-Ooh, ooh.

941
00:43:30,146 --> 00:43:30,814
Oh, try this.

942
00:43:34,784 --> 00:43:36,586
Thrift stores smell like giving up.

943
00:43:36,653 --> 00:43:38,788
I imagine this is
how the set of <i>Girls </i>smells.

944
00:43:38,855 --> 00:43:41,558
-Smells like Johnny Depp.
-These kids will wear a T-shirt

945
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:44,527
about not doing drugs,
then do drugs while wearing that shirt.

946
00:43:44,594 --> 00:43:46,730
That shirt makes you look
like Jared Fogle.

947
00:43:47,163 --> 00:43:49,633
Thanks. I'm nowhere near
as good-looking as that guy.

948
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:50,734
-Take that off.
-Yeah.

949
00:43:52,769 --> 00:43:55,605
[Carey] Listen, I'm gonna be here
for the next two weeks.

950
00:43:55,672 --> 00:43:58,375
Make sure things run smooth
at our new Silver Lake store.

951
00:43:58,441 --> 00:44:01,144
But I'm thinking maybe I can steal
some secrets from you,

952
00:44:01,211 --> 00:44:03,813
teach them how to run a good business.
What do you say?

953
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,915
-Oh, by all means. Be my guest.
-[knocking on door]

954
00:44:06,182 --> 00:44:07,550
-Hey-- Uh...
-That would be...

955
00:44:07,617 --> 00:44:10,453
-Oh. Come in.
-I didn't mean to interrupt.

956
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,255
I have those tallies for you, Danny,

957
00:44:12,322 --> 00:44:15,892
-but I can come back later if you're--
-No, no, no. Brooke. Oh, no. Stay. Stay.

958
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:18,595
I'm sure Carey wants
to see how we do business.

959
00:44:18,662 --> 00:44:19,763
You are damn right I do.

960
00:44:20,196 --> 00:44:21,398
By the way, uh,

961
00:44:21,464 --> 00:44:25,301
Brooke just broke up with her boyfriend,
so, now she's single, cha-ching.

962
00:44:28,338 --> 00:44:29,539
Lay it on us, Brooke.

963
00:44:30,373 --> 00:44:32,676
Registers One and Two are even.

964
00:44:33,643 --> 00:44:36,212
Register Three is 50 cents over.

965
00:44:36,379 --> 00:44:42,185
Register Four is
820 dollars and seven cents under.

966
00:44:42,252 --> 00:44:44,554
-Register Five is even.
-What was that?

967
00:44:45,388 --> 00:44:46,589
Register Five is even?

968
00:44:46,656 --> 00:44:47,524
No.

969
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:49,592
Register Four.

970
00:44:49,659 --> 00:44:53,329
Chester's register is missing
820 dollars and seven cents.

971
00:44:54,431 --> 00:44:56,666
-I don't have a ride. Shit.
-[Chester] Cover my register!

972
00:44:56,733 --> 00:44:59,602
Hey, I'm so sorry.
Our card machine's actually not working.

973
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,307
Eight hundred.

974
00:45:04,774 --> 00:45:06,576
I'll take those tallies.

975
00:45:06,643 --> 00:45:07,577
Thank you, Brooke.

976
00:45:10,346 --> 00:45:12,582
-It was nice to meet you.
-Nice meeting you, dear.

977
00:45:14,484 --> 00:45:15,385
[Danny] Uh...

978
00:45:16,386 --> 00:45:18,321
You want a Kombucha or something?

979
00:45:18,388 --> 00:45:20,290
[Chester] <i>This is Chester.</i>
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

980
00:45:20,523 --> 00:45:23,726
When I said you owe me $5,000,
I didn't mean steal it

981
00:45:23,793 --> 00:45:27,497
from our store, you lazy fuck.
We're a high-end grocery store.

982
00:45:27,897 --> 00:45:30,834
I have cameras all over the place
to watch people like you.

983
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,268
Oh, shit.

984
00:45:41,478 --> 00:45:42,378
Come on!

985
00:45:43,313 --> 00:45:43,980
Come on.

986
00:45:45,615 --> 00:45:46,883
Erase, erase, erase.

987
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:50,253
Erase.
Where's the "erase" button on this thing?

988
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:55,959
[sighs]

989
00:45:56,359 --> 00:45:57,560
Fucking cunt.

990
00:45:57,627 --> 00:46:00,597
[Greg]<i> Danny. Pick up, pronto.</i>
<i>We need you at the front of the store.</i>

991
00:46:00,663 --> 00:46:03,533
Just give them a refund.
I don't have time for some geriatric

992
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,969
trying to return day-old bread.
Fucking losers!

993
00:46:06,035 --> 00:46:09,772
Man, uh... I should've probably told you.
You're on speakerphone.

994
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,775
Also... these guys aren't old.

995
00:46:12,842 --> 00:46:14,611
Hey, who--? Who are you guys?

996
00:46:14,677 --> 00:46:15,612
We're cops.

997
00:46:15,678 --> 00:46:18,414
[Greg]<i> Wait, hold on. I had my hand</i>
<i>on the button the whole time.</i>

998
00:46:18,481 --> 00:46:20,517
<i>Did you get that, Danny?</i>
<i>These guys are cops.</i>

999
00:46:20,583 --> 00:46:22,619
[woman] What's your relationship
to Jay Morrison?

1000
00:46:22,685 --> 00:46:24,020
[Danny] Speak up. It's loud in here.

1001
00:46:24,287 --> 00:46:25,889
What's your relationship to Jay Morrison?

1002
00:46:25,955 --> 00:46:27,290
I don't know who that is.

1003
00:46:27,357 --> 00:46:29,893
You know, a lot of people come in
and out of here all day.

1004
00:46:30,293 --> 00:46:33,997
If I started keeping track of him,
that would be considered racial profiling.

1005
00:46:34,063 --> 00:46:35,798
We didn't say what race he was.

1006
00:46:35,865 --> 00:46:37,901
Anybody can be racially profiled,
all right?

1007
00:46:37,967 --> 00:46:40,403
I'm starting
to feel a little victimized myself.

1008
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:42,705
I might call Al Sharpton if this keeps up.

1009
00:46:42,772 --> 00:46:45,775
-Million Man March your asses.
-So, you have no idea who this is?

1010
00:46:45,842 --> 00:46:48,545
-I don't know who it is.
-We know Jay's your coke dealer.

1011
00:46:48,611 --> 00:46:51,347
And I'm confident if we looked
at the surveillance drives

1012
00:46:51,414 --> 00:46:53,449
we could verify he was here this morning.

1013
00:46:53,516 --> 00:46:56,986
We don't care about you.
We need you to help turn Jay in.

1014
00:46:58,755 --> 00:46:59,989
I don't think I can do that.

1015
00:47:00,056 --> 00:47:02,025
All right. Would you rather we lock you up

1016
00:47:02,091 --> 00:47:04,694
for possession of narcotics
with intent to distribute?

1017
00:47:04,861 --> 00:47:07,697
Because I don't have a problem with that.

1018
00:47:08,865 --> 00:47:10,333
-Do you?
-Oh, not at all.

1019
00:47:10,466 --> 00:47:12,402
Also add on organized criminal gambling,

1020
00:47:12,468 --> 00:47:15,538
and you're looking
at 5 to 10 years in prison.

1021
00:47:15,605 --> 00:47:17,407
You have by 6:00 to decide.

1022
00:47:17,473 --> 00:47:18,775
You either help us lock up Jay

1023
00:47:18,841 --> 00:47:22,111
or two L.A.P.D. officers will pick you up
in a squad car.

1024
00:47:22,812 --> 00:47:23,813
Better lawyer up.

1025
00:47:24,447 --> 00:47:25,682
I always wanted to say that.

1026
00:47:48,972 --> 00:47:50,373
[door opens, then closes]

1027
00:47:53,042 --> 00:47:54,911
-Yo what's up?
-Hey.

1028
00:47:54,978 --> 00:47:56,746
Where's the money for the tickets?

1029
00:47:56,813 --> 00:47:59,482
-He didn't want 'em.
-He drove all the way here

1030
00:47:59,549 --> 00:48:02,151
-and didn't want them?
-He said he had to work or something.

1031
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:05,521
I mean, I can't force him
to buy the tickets, babe.

1032
00:48:05,888 --> 00:48:08,558
Okay, why you getting so defensive for?

1033
00:48:08,625 --> 00:48:11,527
You really wanted me
to make sure that he paid for the tickets,

1034
00:48:11,594 --> 00:48:14,130
and he didn't buy the tickets
because he didn't want them.

1035
00:48:14,397 --> 00:48:16,933
Okay, damn. Just asked you a question.

1036
00:48:17,834 --> 00:48:19,869
-You mad at me?
-No, I'm not mad at you.

1037
00:48:19,936 --> 00:48:22,038
-You mad at me.
-I'm not mad at you, babe.

1038
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:24,540
Let me make it up to you. Come on.

1039
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:28,077
-Wanna get chair massages or something?
-Yeah.

1040
00:48:28,144 --> 00:48:31,080
-Then get something to eat?
-Oh, my God. I'm so hungry.

1041
00:48:31,748 --> 00:48:34,050
All right. Pick a place. My treat.

1042
00:48:34,117 --> 00:48:35,952
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1043
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,756
What's this?

1044
00:48:40,723 --> 00:48:41,591
What?

1045
00:48:44,961 --> 00:48:46,429
These ain't my tickets.

1046
00:48:48,197 --> 00:48:49,732
You playing stupid right now?

1047
00:48:49,832 --> 00:48:50,700
Huh?

1048
00:48:51,134 --> 00:48:53,169
These ain't my fucking tickets.

1049
00:48:55,471 --> 00:48:57,140
Yeah, I'm gonna see you at the concert.

1050
00:48:58,741 --> 00:49:00,543
Calm down, baby. It's gonna be fine.

1051
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:02,545
-Don't lose your temper.
-Get the fuck...

1052
00:49:02,612 --> 00:49:05,148
Serious? You got his number
and let him steal my tickets?

1053
00:49:05,214 --> 00:49:06,649
You're a fucking thot.

1054
00:49:08,584 --> 00:49:10,953
[groans] Ow!

1055
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:13,156
-I'm tired of you disrespecting me.
-That hurt.

1056
00:49:13,923 --> 00:49:15,224
[sighs]
[groans]

1057
00:49:15,892 --> 00:49:17,860
-Come here.
-[groans]

1058
00:49:21,064 --> 00:49:23,566
Look, we've been together six years.

1059
00:49:24,467 --> 00:49:26,969
I'm just trying to get you
to be honest with yourself.

1060
00:49:27,036 --> 00:49:28,805
I'm honest with you every single day.

1061
00:49:28,871 --> 00:49:31,674
-What are you talking about?
-No, not with me. With you.

1062
00:49:32,909 --> 00:49:35,545
Why do you watch porn all the time
when I'm right here?

1063
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:38,648
Jay, what kind of porn are you watching?

1064
00:49:38,715 --> 00:49:40,850
Why the fuck would you ask me
that question?

1065
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:43,753
-What kind of porn are you watching?
-You know what?

1066
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,889
I'm just gonna come out and say it. Um...

1067
00:49:47,957 --> 00:49:50,893
Do you wanna fuck other girls,
or do you wanna sleep with men?

1068
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,229
Either one is okay, Jay.

1069
00:49:53,496 --> 00:49:56,966
I just need to know,
so I can stop lying to myself.

1070
00:49:57,033 --> 00:49:59,135
Please, just tell me.

1071
00:50:01,671 --> 00:50:04,874
When I get back,
I want all your shit out of here.

1072
00:50:10,012 --> 00:50:12,648
[door opens, then closes]

1073
00:50:12,715 --> 00:50:14,250
Oh, hey, Brooke. Hey, Brooke.

1074
00:50:16,853 --> 00:50:19,155
-Yep.
-Hey, Brooke. Would you do me a favor?

1075
00:50:19,222 --> 00:50:20,723
Would you go down to my office

1076
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:23,126
and just ask Mr. Winters
if he knows where I am?

1077
00:50:23,192 --> 00:50:26,229
-Do I tell him you're in here?
-Just ask if he knows where I am.

1078
00:50:26,295 --> 00:50:29,298
-But you're in here.
-Just do it! I am sorry, okay?

1079
00:50:29,565 --> 00:50:33,202
I'm sorry I yelled at you again.
Would you do me that favor, please?

1080
00:50:34,537 --> 00:50:36,005
-Yeah.
-Thank you, sweetheart.

1081
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:38,875
Please, don't call me sweetheart.

1082
00:50:38,941 --> 00:50:41,844
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sweetheart. I'm--
-What are you doing?

1083
00:50:41,911 --> 00:50:44,180
I was just gonna--
You have a little-- That's--

1084
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,115
Hey, thanks a lot.

1085
00:50:46,182 --> 00:50:47,850
I appreciate. Do me that favor.

1086
00:50:47,917 --> 00:50:48,985
You're the best.

1087
00:50:58,995 --> 00:51:01,864
[inaudible dialogue]

1088
00:51:04,767 --> 00:51:05,802
[cell phone ringing]

1089
00:51:05,868 --> 00:51:07,003
[cell phone ringing]

1090
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:11,674
Danny, I know what you'll say. It's okay.
I'll get your money. Don't worry.

1091
00:51:11,741 --> 00:51:15,812
Good, because the price just went up.
Now you owe me an additional $800.

1092
00:51:15,878 --> 00:51:18,614
-<i>What? Why 800?</i>
-Your register was short this morning.

1093
00:51:18,681 --> 00:51:21,851
You didn't think I was gonna find out,
you piece of shit?

1094
00:51:21,918 --> 00:51:24,220
Fuck it, call the cops.
I don't give a shit anymore.

1095
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:26,355
-Fuck you.
-It's all you. Goodbye.

1096
00:51:26,622 --> 00:51:27,290
Hello?!

1097
00:51:28,825 --> 00:51:30,193
Son of a bitch!

1098
00:51:32,728 --> 00:51:34,130
[Jay] "Maybe you wanna sleep with men.

1099
00:51:34,197 --> 00:51:36,599
Maybe that's your thing."
Man, fuck these labels.

1100
00:51:36,666 --> 00:51:38,734
No one puts me in a box,
I put you in a box.

1101
00:51:44,207 --> 00:51:46,075
Doing good. Money and pussy.

1102
00:51:46,142 --> 00:51:47,310
Come on, keep it together.

1103
00:51:47,376 --> 00:51:49,912
Keep it together,
keep it together, keep it together.

1104
00:51:51,214 --> 00:51:52,715
What the fuck?

1105
00:51:52,782 --> 00:51:53,816
Are you serious?

1106
00:51:55,318 --> 00:51:56,986
[cell phone ringing and buzzing]

1107
00:51:57,053 --> 00:51:58,354
[Jay] I see you, motherfucker.

1108
00:51:59,021 --> 00:52:01,190
[Chester] I don't know
what you're talking about, man.

1109
00:52:01,257 --> 00:52:02,325
You know what? Fuck it.

1110
00:52:02,391 --> 00:52:05,061
Gonna send me to voicemail,
you silly sexy motherfucker?

1111
00:52:05,127 --> 00:52:06,729
Okay. Here we go.

1112
00:52:07,163 --> 00:52:08,898
It's showtime, motherfucker.

1113
00:52:09,866 --> 00:52:12,168
-Oh, shit.
-It's Jay time, motherfucker.

1114
00:52:13,369 --> 00:52:14,303
Oh! Fuck that!

1115
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:16,739
How you like them apples?

-[Chris] Brake!

1118
00:52:22,979 --> 00:52:25,781
-Get the fuck off! I know how to drive!
-Oh, my God!

1119
00:52:25,848 --> 00:52:27,383
Jay in this bitch!
Jay in this bitch!

1120
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:29,418
Rest in peace, motherfuckers!

1121
00:52:41,864 --> 00:52:44,667
What the fuck happened, man?
You cut off that Range Rover?

1122
00:52:44,734 --> 00:52:46,802
No. No, you saw me driving.

1123
00:52:47,336 --> 00:52:48,671
[panting]

1124
00:52:49,405 --> 00:52:51,974
-Was it a black Range Rover?
-Yeah. Why?

1125
00:52:53,409 --> 00:52:55,311
-What the fuck did you do?
-Nothing.

1126
00:52:55,444 --> 00:52:58,681
Nothing, okay? I stole two tickets
and some moonrocks

1127
00:52:58,748 --> 00:53:01,751
from some guy on Craigslist.
It's fine. He's trying to scare us.

1128
00:53:01,817 --> 00:53:03,686
-I could've been killed.
-What about me?

1129
00:53:03,753 --> 00:53:06,322
-I could've been killed, too.
-You'd be Suge, I'd be Pac.

1130
00:53:06,389 --> 00:53:09,191
-You'd be Puff, I'd be Big.
-Why are you always the best rappers

1131
00:53:09,258 --> 00:53:10,960
in these hypotheticals?

1132
00:53:11,027 --> 00:53:13,462
No one forced you to come here.
You could've said no.

1133
00:53:13,729 --> 00:53:16,265
I would've been in Brazil
right now probably

1134
00:53:16,332 --> 00:53:19,101
-if I wasn't carrying your dead weight.
-All right.

1135
00:53:19,168 --> 00:53:21,871
-Wanna know why I always work the double?
-I don't know.

1136
00:53:21,938 --> 00:53:24,440
Because I'm making back the money
that you stole from me.

1137
00:53:25,074 --> 00:53:28,144
That I stole from you?
What did I steal from you, huh?

1138
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:29,345
Organix?

1139
00:53:29,412 --> 00:53:31,981
Remember?
You talked me into stealing it with you,

1140
00:53:32,048 --> 00:53:35,851
and then you sold that shit for $5,000
and told me you sold it for 3,000.

1141
00:53:35,918 --> 00:53:39,121
Whoever told you that's a liar,
knew your gullible ass believed 'em.

1142
00:53:39,188 --> 00:53:42,325
I didn't believe it until now,
but you have a tell when you lie.

1143
00:53:42,391 --> 00:53:45,394
You squint your fucking eyes
every time you're lying, man.

1144
00:53:45,461 --> 00:53:48,264
-That's how I know you're lying.
-No, that's my go-to look.

1145
00:53:49,365 --> 00:53:50,299
Where are you going?

1146
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:57,273
{\an8}[Chester] We've been walking
for two hours. We haven't seen a car yet.

1147
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:58,841
Sure this is the right way?

1148
00:53:58,908 --> 00:54:00,476
[Chris] How many times
will you ask me that?

1149
00:54:00,743 --> 00:54:02,445
But why are we walking
in the same direction

1150
00:54:02,511 --> 00:54:04,947
as the guy who tried to kill us
drove off in?

1151
00:54:05,414 --> 00:54:10,219
Look, the concert's the safest place.
All right, 15,000 people, metal detectors.

1152
00:54:10,286 --> 00:54:13,456
I got the tickets he was trying to sell.
All right? He can't get in.

1153
00:54:13,522 --> 00:54:16,926
What if he's thinking that
that's the one place we'll for sure be?

1154
00:54:17,526 --> 00:54:18,394
Right?

1155
00:54:18,461 --> 00:54:21,497
I thought you were gonna hitchhike home.
Why are you following me, huh?

1156
00:54:21,864 --> 00:54:24,266
There's a lot of desert here.
Fucking go another way.

1157
00:54:28,037 --> 00:54:28,971
What is that?

1158
00:54:29,372 --> 00:54:30,339
Seriously?

1159
00:54:32,108 --> 00:54:34,276
I'm not gonna follow you this time, Chris.

1160
00:54:35,244 --> 00:54:36,178
I'm done.

1161
00:54:47,189 --> 00:54:48,157
Wait up.

1162
00:54:53,095 --> 00:54:54,263
Chris, what are you doing?

1163
00:54:56,866 --> 00:54:57,533
What are you...?

1164
00:55:32,968 --> 00:55:34,570
Dude, Brazil is nothing like this.

1165
00:55:35,838 --> 00:55:37,106
There are beaches everywhere.

1166
00:55:37,873 --> 00:55:38,874
You're gonna love it.

1167
00:55:38,941 --> 00:55:41,310
[Chris] Yeah, it sounds great, dude.
I can't wait to go.

1168
00:55:42,578 --> 00:55:44,947
I don't think I can... I can't make it.

1169
00:55:45,014 --> 00:55:46,082
I'm so thirsty.

1170
00:55:46,148 --> 00:55:47,149
That's all right, man.

1171
00:55:47,216 --> 00:55:48,084
Come on.

1172
00:55:48,484 --> 00:55:50,486
-[pants]
-It's not far.

1173
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:53,189
Okay, okay.

1174
00:55:53,255 --> 00:55:54,390
[motor roaring]

1175
00:55:54,457 --> 00:55:56,192
Oh, yes, yes, yes...

1176
00:55:56,959 --> 00:55:59,962
-[Chester] Oh. Okay. Come on. Hey.
-[Chris] Yo, yo, yo! Yo! Please!

1177
00:56:00,062 --> 00:56:01,931
-[Chester] I can help.
-[Chris] I got it.

1178
00:56:01,997 --> 00:56:03,399
Please! Please! Please!

1179
00:56:08,938 --> 00:56:10,339
Hi. Hi.

1180
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,007
[woman] Look who it is.

1181
00:56:12,074 --> 00:56:14,610
Aren't you the douche
who stole my ex-boyfriend's tickets?

1182
00:56:19,648 --> 00:56:21,317
I feel sad.

1183
00:56:22,151 --> 00:56:24,386
And I feel angry.

1184
00:56:24,453 --> 00:56:25,321
Sure.

1185
00:56:25,955 --> 00:56:27,656
-I feel happy.
-Yeah.

1186
00:56:27,923 --> 00:56:30,326
And, like, I don't even know
what I'm doing here,

1187
00:56:30,392 --> 00:56:33,162
[chuckles] but lucky Carmen
had those two tickets.

1188
00:56:33,229 --> 00:56:36,365
She knows Jay's crazy.
He would never, ever give them to me.

1189
00:56:36,432 --> 00:56:37,533
Love is crazy.

1190
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,534
-You know?
-I guess.

1191
00:56:38,601 --> 00:56:41,504
I mean, I'm old-school.
You know, I wanna meet someone.

1192
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:42,905
I'm not into dating apps.

1193
00:56:42,972 --> 00:56:46,408
If we're meant to be,
you know, only God knows.

1194
00:56:47,076 --> 00:56:48,444
So, how do you know Sahara?

1195
00:56:48,511 --> 00:56:52,114
Oh. We used to work together back at TIYF
in high school.

1196
00:56:52,581 --> 00:56:56,018
Oh, TGIF? Um, Magic Johnson's place
on La Tijera, right?

1197
00:56:56,452 --> 00:56:58,387
No. TIYF. The strip club.

1198
00:56:58,454 --> 00:57:01,123
I'm gonna be honest,
and I'm sure it's the same for you.

1199
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:04,160
The physical side's easy for me.
I can get that whenever I want.

1200
00:57:04,226 --> 00:57:06,328
But I wanna come here. You know?

1201
00:57:06,595 --> 00:57:07,696
I wanna come here.

1202
00:57:08,664 --> 00:57:10,499
And I wanna make you come there.

1203
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,668
I wanna make you come in the heart.

1204
00:57:12,935 --> 00:57:15,171
Has that lame-ass line ever worked
on a girl?

1205
00:57:16,038 --> 00:57:18,941
Just trying to be a nice guy.
What are you talking about?

1206
00:57:19,008 --> 00:57:20,376
Do you still strip?

1207
00:57:20,443 --> 00:57:21,510
No. [scoffs]

1208
00:57:21,577 --> 00:57:23,279
-Yeah.
-I'm a paralegalist now.

1209
00:57:23,345 --> 00:57:25,281
-Oh, that's good. Yeah. Yeah.
-Please.

1210
00:57:27,716 --> 00:57:28,951
[Sahara] Here we go.

1211
00:57:30,619 --> 00:57:32,988
-We'll just park the car.
-We'll meet you in line.

1212
00:57:33,055 --> 00:57:34,190
[Carmen] Okay. Save us a spot.

1213
00:57:34,256 --> 00:57:35,691
[Chester] Here. Oh, no, here. I got it.

1214
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:36,625
Watch your head.

1215
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:38,294
-Thank you.
-Of course.

1216
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,229
-All right. Bye, guys.
-[Chester and Chris] Bye.

1217
00:57:41,096 --> 00:57:42,531
-Nice touch.
-Thank you.

1218
00:57:43,265 --> 00:57:45,134
-You know she's a stripper?
-Really?

1219
00:57:45,601 --> 00:57:46,602
Topless or all-nude?

1220
00:57:47,036 --> 00:57:49,338
-Uh... Full frontal, I think.
-Oh, great.

1221
00:57:49,405 --> 00:57:50,439
-Yeah.
-Where does she work?

1222
00:57:50,506 --> 00:57:51,373
Uh...

1223
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,410
-Titties in Your... Titties in Your Face?
-Vermont and Washington?

1224
00:57:54,477 --> 00:57:56,579
-Yeah. You been?
-Yeah. It's a new location.

1225
00:57:56,645 --> 00:57:59,081
[indistinct chattering]

1226
00:57:59,148 --> 00:58:00,683
[Chester] So,
how do you know Sahara again?

1227
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:03,486
I met her this morning.
When I got the tickets.

1228
00:58:04,253 --> 00:58:05,120
At the...?

1229
00:58:07,122 --> 00:58:11,193
You hit on the drug dealer's girlfriend,
stole his tickets,

1230
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:12,761
-and his moonrocks?
-No.

1231
00:58:13,429 --> 00:58:14,430
Okay, good.

1232
00:58:14,497 --> 00:58:17,333
I stole the moonrocks and tickets,
and then I hit on her.

1233
00:58:18,234 --> 00:58:20,769
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
I sort of stole 800 bucks

1234
00:58:21,036 --> 00:58:22,671
-from your register.
-What?

1235
00:58:22,738 --> 00:58:25,007
How else could I get my car out
of the garage?

1236
00:58:25,074 --> 00:58:28,511
-Don't worry, I'll make your money back.
-You're always saying "don't worry."

1237
00:58:28,577 --> 00:58:31,180
I got moonrocks.
Uncut moonrocks. Want moonrocks?

1238
00:58:31,247 --> 00:58:34,149
-[man] Designer. FDA-approved.
-You a cop? Just kidding. Want drugs?

1239
00:58:34,216 --> 00:58:36,552
Actually, it's 175 for two.
You wanna do two?

1240
00:58:36,619 --> 00:58:38,754
Hundred for a gram. Moonrocks. Moonrocks.

1241
00:58:39,021 --> 00:58:39,755
We're at capacity.

1242
00:58:40,422 --> 00:58:43,459
They'll refund your tickets at the window.
Go home.

1243
00:58:44,126 --> 00:58:45,427
-It's over.
-[man 1] You kidding me?

1244
00:58:45,494 --> 00:58:47,596
-I've been waiting for hours, man.
-[man 2] Come on!

1245
00:58:47,663 --> 00:58:49,532
-You don't even know.
-[man 3] Hey, back up.

1246
00:58:49,598 --> 00:58:51,767
-Back away from the gate.
-[Chester] What's going on?

1247
00:58:52,034 --> 00:58:54,370
They're shutting it down.
Gotta find another way in.

1248
00:58:55,404 --> 00:58:56,572
-[man 4] I need backup!
-[man 5] Come on.

1249
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,541
-[man 6] Let us in!
-[man 4] We're at capacity.

1250
00:59:00,409 --> 00:59:01,677
-[Chester] What?
-Come on.

1251
00:59:02,278 --> 00:59:04,446
[man 4] All tickets will be refunded
at the front desk.

1252
00:59:04,513 --> 00:59:05,681
Let's go.

1253
00:59:07,149 --> 00:59:10,185
[man 4] Back up. Back away, and stop...

1254
00:59:10,252 --> 00:59:13,522
[Chester] I got something I wanna tell
you. It's super important. Stay there.

1255
00:59:15,357 --> 00:59:16,325
[Chris] Yeah, what's up?

1256
00:59:16,392 --> 00:59:18,561
[both groaning]

1257
00:59:19,228 --> 00:59:20,596
-Ow.
-What the fuck?

1258
00:59:20,663 --> 00:59:24,733
You stole $800 from my register
and didn't tell me?

1259
00:59:25,634 --> 00:59:27,736
I did it for us, so we could come here.

1260
00:59:27,803 --> 00:59:29,672
I'm the one who gets in trouble for it.

1261
00:59:29,738 --> 00:59:32,508
You ever think of that?
What else haven't you told me, huh?

1262
00:59:32,575 --> 00:59:34,677
-Come clean now.
-What do you want me to say?

1263
00:59:34,743 --> 00:59:35,611
The truth.

1264
00:59:36,612 --> 00:59:39,248
-For once. Come on.
-What do you want me to do?

1265
00:59:39,315 --> 00:59:40,849
Recap every lie I've ever told

1266
00:59:41,116 --> 00:59:42,484
-in our relationship?
-Please.

1267
00:59:42,551 --> 00:59:44,587
Do you want me
to give a fucking Venn diagram

1268
00:59:44,653 --> 00:59:47,423
of all the mini-truths
and half-truths and somewhat-truths?

1269
00:59:47,489 --> 00:59:49,692
-Yeah.
-I don't know. I don't remember them all.

1270
00:59:49,758 --> 00:59:51,527
All right, let's start with Brazil.

1271
00:59:52,494 --> 00:59:53,829
-What about Brazil?
-Come on.

1272
00:59:54,096 --> 00:59:55,164
-Stop.
-Tell me.

1273
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:57,466
-If you don't stop touching me--
-Fucking tell me.

1274
00:59:57,533 --> 00:59:59,668
-Don't fucking touch me.
-Tell me about Brazil.

1275
00:59:59,735 --> 01:00:00,769
What do you wanna know?

1276
01:00:00,836 --> 01:00:02,271
Are you going or not?

1277
01:00:02,338 --> 01:00:03,305
I was never going.

1278
01:00:06,675 --> 01:00:08,510
I was never going, Chester. I'm sorry.

1279
01:00:12,314 --> 01:00:13,882
I just wanted to hear you say it.

1280
01:00:24,893 --> 01:00:26,161
[crowd cheering]

1281
01:00:29,865 --> 01:00:30,833
Can we just go?

1282
01:00:32,668 --> 01:00:34,169
Can we just go to the concert?

1283

["100 Roses" playing]

1322
01:02:07,996 --> 01:02:10,499
I could just pitch a tent
and, like, set up camp here.

I mean, did you see yourself out there?
Everybody was like,

1326
01:02:16,305 --> 01:02:18,607
"Who's that cool guy dancing the samba
to rap music,

1327

-Seriously?
-Yes.

1329
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:23,479
You should do more drugs.

1330

-Oh, my God. Give me more. Come on.
-No. Chill.

1331
01:02:25,914 --> 01:02:28,650
-Not now. I gotta sell the rest.
-Come on. I want some.

1332

You said you only had two tickets left.

1339

-I assumed you told the truth.
-I'm a businessman. That's what I do.

Makes sense to me.
Basic supply-and-demand economics.

1341
01:02:50,973 --> 01:02:53,375
-Well, I trusted you.
-You stole my tickets.

1342
01:02:53,442 --> 01:02:55,310
Yeah. But as far as you knew, you know,

1343

you lied before you knew
I stole your tickets.

1344
01:02:57,579 --> 01:03:00,048
So, technically, you know, you lied first.

Where's the rest?

1364

In the car.

1365

One last thing.
I just wanna know one last thing.

1383
01:04:30,505 --> 01:04:32,574
Does Medicare cover hip replacement?

1384
01:04:32,641 --> 01:04:34,610
-What?
-'Cause when I'm 50 like you,

1385

1478
01:09:46,087 --> 01:09:48,423
Sometimes I like men.
Sometimes I like women.

1479
01:09:48,690 --> 01:09:51,026
Sometimes I feel like a woman
who likes women, coz.

1480
01:09:51,092 --> 01:09:53,895
Just give me the fucking baggies,
get the fuck out of here.

1481
01:09:53,962 --> 01:09:55,730
I'm fucking tired of these labels.

1482
01:09:55,797 --> 01:09:57,766
I'm just trying to be honest with you,
man.

1483
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:03,238
[siren wailing]

1484
01:10:14,449 --> 01:10:17,919
What are you doing? What are you doing?
What are you doing, man?

1485
01:10:17,986 --> 01:10:19,721
-Don't do it.
-Oh, motherfucker.

1486
01:10:19,788 --> 01:10:22,057
Don't pull-- Don't do that.
No, no. Don't do it.

1487
01:10:22,123 --> 01:10:23,925
Hands up. Hands up. Drop the bag.

1488
01:10:23,992 --> 01:10:25,927
[sirens wailing]

1489
01:10:25,994 --> 01:10:27,495
[officer] Freeze! Hands in the air!

1490
01:10:30,098 --> 01:10:32,033
What took you guys so long?
What the hell?

1491
01:10:32,133 --> 01:10:35,437
The guy kissed me on the mouth.
You couldn't show up two seconds earlier?

1492
01:10:35,503 --> 01:10:39,140
-We all really enjoyed that, Danny.
-Just because I'm running a business here

1493
01:10:39,207 --> 01:10:42,077
you think I got some kind
of white-collar crime going on here.

1494
01:10:42,143 --> 01:10:43,345
It's fucking racist, man.

1495
01:10:43,411 --> 01:10:46,181
-Good day, Mr. Bryant.
-[Danny] Good day to you.

1496
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:11,339
[Greg]<i> Y'all see Mia Lee</i>
<i>from KCAL News outside?</i>

1497
01:11:11,406 --> 01:11:14,809
She was eyeing your boy mad hard.

1498
01:11:14,876 --> 01:11:18,446
Yo, it was like she was jerking me off
with her eyes.

1499
01:11:18,513 --> 01:11:21,016
The craziest part about it? I came, nigga.

1500
01:11:21,082 --> 01:11:24,219
Okay. Back to work, everybody.
Break's up.

1501
01:11:24,286 --> 01:11:27,088
Greg, your break was up five minutes ago.
Back on the floor.

1502
01:11:27,155 --> 01:11:29,557
I thought we were cool.
I just took you to Jamba Juice.

1503
01:11:29,824 --> 01:11:31,926
Got you one with wheatgrass.
What the fuck?

1504
01:11:32,427 --> 01:11:33,295
[knocking on door]

1505
01:11:33,461 --> 01:11:34,829
Come on in.

1506
01:11:34,896 --> 01:11:35,997
-Danny.
-What's up, girl?

1507
01:11:38,366 --> 01:11:40,869
[clears throat] So...
there's some people here to see you.

1508
01:11:41,903 --> 01:11:43,405
It's 8:00 in the morning.

1509
01:11:44,506 --> 01:11:46,441
I don't know, but they asked for you.

1510
01:11:46,508 --> 01:11:49,477
They asked for me? Who did? Who is?
Who are they, asking for me?

1511
01:11:49,544 --> 01:11:51,546
I guess I'm pretty popular these days.

1512
01:11:51,846 --> 01:11:52,881
[chuckles]

1513
01:11:54,149 --> 01:11:55,016
Hey, guys.

1514
01:11:55,083 --> 01:11:56,284
Did you forget something?

1515
01:11:56,351 --> 01:11:57,452
Kind of.

1516
01:11:57,519 --> 01:11:59,888
-We have a situation here.
-Well, I'm sorry

1517
01:11:59,954 --> 01:12:02,490
I don't have any more bookies
to turn over to you.

1518
01:12:02,557 --> 01:12:04,826
I'm clean as a virgin's pussy.

1519
01:12:04,893 --> 01:12:06,528
That is wildly inappropriate.

1520
01:12:06,594 --> 01:12:08,463
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1521
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:11,132
There was $1,800
unaccounted for yesterday,

1522
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:13,134
and Mr. Winters claims that you stole it.

1523
01:12:15,937 --> 01:12:17,605
Know what? I'm glad you guys are here.

1524
01:12:17,872 --> 01:12:19,140
Because one of my employees,

1525
01:12:19,207 --> 01:12:21,476
Chester Tamborghini,
has a lot of explaining to do.

1526
01:12:21,543 --> 01:12:24,145
He's the one who's responsible
for that missing money.

1527
01:12:24,346 --> 01:12:26,481
He'll be here any minute.
Get those cuffs ready.

1528
01:12:26,548 --> 01:12:29,984
Well, if that's the case,
how do you explain the security footage

1529
01:12:30,051 --> 01:12:32,620
of you taking money
from the registers yesterday morning?

1530
01:12:32,887 --> 01:12:34,255
That's considered felony theft.

1531
01:12:34,322 --> 01:12:37,392
I don't know
what footage you're referring to.

1532
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,595
Would you do me a favor?
Go down to my office,

1533
01:12:40,862 --> 01:12:42,630
<i>and ask Mr. Winters</i>
<i>if he knows where I am.</i>

1534
01:12:42,897 --> 01:12:44,999
Danny's hiding from you in the back room.

1535
01:12:45,066 --> 01:12:48,870
I don't have time for this shit.
You tell him if that money doesn't show up

1536
01:12:48,937 --> 01:12:50,905
by tomorrow morning,
the police will. Okay?

1537
01:12:51,373 --> 01:12:53,241
-Yep.
-Bitch!

1538
01:13:02,217 --> 01:13:05,286
[woman] <i>Mr. Winters didn't say</i>
<i>who specifically turned over the footage,</i>

1539
01:13:05,353 --> 01:13:08,022
<i>but needless to say,</i>
<i>it'll hold up in court.</i>

1540
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:13,228
That girl's a criminal.

1541
01:13:13,628 --> 01:13:16,364
She probably took that footage
to George Lucas

1542
01:13:16,431 --> 01:13:19,134
and had my face CGI'd onto Chester's body.

1543
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,068
Come on.

1544
01:13:20,135 --> 01:13:22,570
Pound it out, bro. You're under arrest.

1545
01:13:22,637 --> 01:13:25,507
I didn't take the money.
I didn't-- I'm not-- I swear to God.

1546
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:27,475
You have the right to remain silent.

1547
01:13:27,542 --> 01:13:30,311
Anything you say can be used against you
in a court of law.

1548
01:13:30,378 --> 01:13:33,148
You don't have to do this.
I got cash with your name on it.

1549
01:13:33,214 --> 01:13:35,183
No one has to know, not even your partner.

1550
01:13:35,683 --> 01:13:38,286
Hey, Danny. Meet your new cell mate.

1551
01:13:38,953 --> 01:13:40,455
Oh, fuck. Get the fuck out of here.

1552
01:13:40,522 --> 01:13:43,224
I can't get in-- I can't do this.
I'm not built for this.

1553
01:13:43,324 --> 01:13:45,093
-I'll give the money back.
-Come on.

1554
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:48,096
-I'll give it back. Please.
-There you go. Make friends.

1555
01:13:48,163 --> 01:13:49,097
Be nice.

1556
01:13:50,031 --> 01:13:51,299
What's good, Danny?

1557
01:13:54,035 --> 01:13:56,304
[Greg]<i> Hey, Chris.</i>
<i>Is Chester coming in to work today?</i>

1558
01:13:56,971 --> 01:14:00,208
You know, I worked the morning shift,
but I can't do a double tonight,

1559
01:14:00,275 --> 01:14:01,509
because I got a date.

1560
01:14:02,343 --> 01:14:04,179
Got a date? With who?

1561
01:14:04,245 --> 01:14:06,347
Nope.
I'm not even falling for this one again.

1562
01:14:06,414 --> 01:14:07,615
No. I know how this goes.

1563
01:14:07,682 --> 01:14:10,118
Remember what happened with my last girl?
Stacey?

1564
01:14:10,185 --> 01:14:13,354
-The girl I met in church?
-Church is ringing a bell, yeah.

1565
01:14:13,421 --> 01:14:15,423
You fucked her.
I was gonna marry that chick

1566
01:14:15,490 --> 01:14:17,559
and you stole her from me,
you son of a bitch.

1567
01:14:17,625 --> 01:14:19,594
I bought her tickets
to Harry Potter World.

1568
01:14:19,661 --> 01:14:22,564
We were going all the way.
I was gonna get her a quidditch set,

1569
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:24,699
buy her Butterbeer,
I was gonna get her a wand

1570
01:14:24,966 --> 01:14:27,101
-from Ollivanders--
-Just shut up for a second.

1571
01:14:27,735 --> 01:14:30,438
[Chester speaking in Portuguese]

1572
01:14:32,073 --> 01:14:35,543
English? Can you just speak English?
It's gonna be quicker that way.

1573
01:14:35,610 --> 01:14:38,046
Your Portuguese is kind of bad.
No offense.

1574
01:14:38,112 --> 01:14:39,514
One ticket to Sao Paulo, please.

1575
01:14:39,581 --> 01:14:40,548
-Brazil.
-Yes.

1576
01:14:40,615 --> 01:14:42,050
Wow. You must be really excited.

1577
01:14:42,717 --> 01:14:45,453
-I am. [chuckles]
-Okay. When are you returning?

1578
01:14:47,088 --> 01:14:48,389
Not really sure, actually.

1579
01:14:48,456 --> 01:14:51,092
Okay, the only flight
I have available today

1580
01:14:51,159 --> 01:14:53,127
is in coach, and it's $697.

1581
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:57,398
Wow, that's a lot of cash.

1582
01:14:59,601 --> 01:15:01,369
It was a gift from a friend.

1583
01:15:01,436 --> 01:15:02,637
[cell phone ringing]

1584
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:07,675
Okay. Aisle seat okay?

1585
01:15:08,309 --> 01:15:09,744
-Sorry?
-Aisle seat?

1586
01:15:12,614 --> 01:15:13,681
Aisle seat's great.

1587
01:15:13,748 --> 01:15:15,783
Is that Chester?
Tell him I said "what's up?"

1588
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:19,120
[Chester]<i> Hey, it's Chester. I'm out</i>
<i>of the country. Service might be spotty,</i>

1589
01:15:19,187 --> 01:15:21,456
<i>but I'll get back to you</i>
<i>when I get a chance, ciao.</i>

1590
01:15:24,526 --> 01:15:27,762
Gregory, you and I have the potential
to become very good friends,

1591
01:15:28,029 --> 01:15:29,697
but I need to know something important.

1592
01:15:30,198 --> 01:15:31,099
Yo, what's up, man?

1593
01:15:31,332 --> 01:15:33,401
Do you have a car? Or plan on buying one?

1594
01:15:33,701 --> 01:15:36,170
Because in my experience,
carpooling is essential

1595
01:15:36,237 --> 01:15:38,172
in building a very real friendship.

1596
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:40,475
You know what's crazy?
I actually don't own a car.

1597
01:15:40,542 --> 01:15:42,410
-I like riding my bike to work.
-Shit.

1598
01:15:42,477 --> 01:15:44,479
It's better for the environment
and cheaper.

1599
01:15:44,546 --> 01:15:46,414
-Right.
-Know what we could do, though?

1600
01:15:46,481 --> 01:15:50,151
Tandem bikes. Tandem bikes, bro.
We can ride 'em around ironically,

1601
01:15:50,218 --> 01:15:53,187
like those hipsters in Highland Park.
What do you say? Hey.

1602
01:15:54,122 --> 01:15:56,658
You gonna leave me hanging like that?
For real, fam?

1603
01:15:57,325 --> 01:16:00,328
I'm not putting my hand down
until you come back.

1604
01:16:00,395 --> 01:16:02,664
Put your hands on your head! Now!

1605
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:04,165
[man] What's the problem, officer?

1606
01:16:04,232 --> 01:16:06,367
The car you're in
has been reported stolen.

1607
01:16:06,501 --> 01:16:08,736
-Get out of the car nice and slow.
-Oh, shit.
