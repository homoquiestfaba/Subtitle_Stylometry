who retained
the presence of mind

1710

to prepare the prisoner
an <i>omelette a la policier,</i>

1711
01:38:09,951 --> 01:38:11,117
which he delivered warm,

1712
01:38:11,184 --> 01:38:13,550
wrapped in a day-old
search warrant.

1713
01:38:15,383 --> 01:38:17,517

1716
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:27,717
It was supposed to be an
article about a great chef.

01:38:27,784 --> 01:38:28,784
ROEBUCK: It is in part.

1718

For the Tastes
and Smells section...

1719
01:38:31,684 --> 01:38:33,017
ROEBUCK: I understand.
The assignment was perfectly clear.

1720
01:38:33,951 --> 01:38:36,817
Perhaps,
you fail to grasp

1721
01:38:36,884 --> 01:38:40,350
that I was shot at and
hand-grenaded against my will.

1722
01:38:40,884 --> 01:38:42,483
I only asked to be fed,

1723
01:38:42,550 --> 01:38:45,617
and was, marvelously,
as I described in some detail.

1724
01:38:45,684 --> 01:38:48,383
Nescaffier only gets
one line of dialogue.

1725
01:38:50,717 --> 01:38:55,584
Well, I did cut something he told me.
It made me too sad.

1726
01:38:55,650 --> 01:38:57,383
I could stick it
back in, if you like.

1727
01:38:58,884 --> 01:39:00,950
What did he say?

I beg your pardon?

The toxic salts
in the radishes...

1735
01:39:45,483 --> 01:39:46,917
they had a flavor.

1736
01:39:47,951 --> 01:39:51,450
Totally unfamiliar to me.

1737

I never tasted
that taste in my life.

1741
01:40:06,483 --> 01:40:08,450
Not entirely pleasant,

1742
01:40:08,917 --> 01:40:11,483
extremely poisonous,

1743
01:40:11,550 --> 01:40:13,917
but still, a new flavor.

01:40:14,951 --> 01:40:17,417
That's a rare thing
at my age.

1745
01:40:19,517 --> 01:40:21,951
I admire your bravery,
Lieutenant.

1746
01:40:22,617 --> 01:40:24,584
I'm not brave.

1747
01:40:25,084 --> 01:40:26,917
I just wasn't

1748
01:40:26,984 --> 01:40:28,884
in the mood to be

1749
01:40:28,951 --> 01:40:30,951

Maybe with good luck,
