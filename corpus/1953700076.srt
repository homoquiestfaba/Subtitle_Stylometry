How bad is he. / He may remember you,
but the memories come and go

30
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:12,525
Most of the time he was in his world

31
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:17,697
But his illness made him very
paranoid

32
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:21,497

00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,319
Oh no, there's nothing wrong?

344
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,251

Come on, hurry.

- l really miss you.
- You do not have anything.

720
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:41,476
Sit down.

01:19:46,381 --> 01:19:47,473
You look nervous.

722
01:19:48,316 --> 01:19:52,446
You must immediately leave me and my family
and never met with Frank again.

723
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:55,252
Do not you worry about them.

724
01:19:55,323 --> 01:19:56,415
You only need to worry about yourself.

725
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:01,285
Oh come on, please, hold your words.

726
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:03,331

lt was no use.

730
01:20:09,437 --> 01:20:10,404
You owe me.

731
01:20:11,506 --> 01:20:14,270
- What would you do, sir?
- That's not a problem.

732
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:16,434

736
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:27,388
- l do not care.
- Do not be stupid like that.

737
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:31,289
l was brought in to the hospital, and
they said he was crazy.

738
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:34,294
You have to trust me, he's not healthy.
