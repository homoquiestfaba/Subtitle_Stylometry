1
00:02:34,971 --> 00:02:36,939
Hello, stranger.

2
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,338
Sorry. Looking for a cigarette.

3
00:03:15,244 --> 00:03:16,575
I've given up.

4
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,647
Thank you.

5
00:03:22,986 --> 00:03:25,216
- Got to be somewhere?
- Work.

6
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:28,747
You didn't fancy my sandwiches?

7
00:03:28,858 --> 00:03:31,486
- Don't eat fish.
- Why not?

8
00:03:32,362 --> 00:03:34,057
Fish piss in the sea.

9
00:03:34,564 --> 00:03:37,397
- So do children.
- Don't eat children, either.

10
00:03:38,701 --> 00:03:40,191
What's your work?

11
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:42,430
I'm sort of a journalist.

12
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:45,605
- What sort?
- I write obituaries.

13
00:03:57,587 --> 00:03:59,748
Are we in for a long wait?

14
00:04:01,858 --> 00:04:03,985
She was 21 when she came in.

15
00:04:06,362 --> 00:04:07,852
Does it hurt?

16
00:04:08,564 --> 00:04:09,895
I'll live.

17
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,468
Do you want me to put your leg up?

18
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:15,094
Yes, please.

19
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,910
Who cut off your crusts?

20
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,344
Me.

21
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:36,358
Did your mother cut off your crusts
when you were a little boy?

22
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:39,793
- Yes, I believe she did.
- You should eat your crusts.

23
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:42,063
You should stop smoking.

24
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:45,089
How long was I out?

25
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:47,728
- About 10 seconds.
- Then what?

26
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:50,996
You came to. You focused on me.

27
00:04:51,074 --> 00:04:53,770
You said, "Hello, stranger."

28
00:04:53,843 --> 00:04:55,401
What a floozy.

29
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:59,312
The cabbie crossed himself, he went,
"Thank fuck. I thought I'd killed her."

30
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,748
I said, "Let's get her to a hospital."
He hesitated.

31
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:05,117
I think he thought there'd be paperwork
and he'd be held responsible.

32
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:08,646
So I said with a slight sneer,
"Please just drop us at the hospital."

33
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:10,316
Show me the sneer.

34
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,228
Very good, buster.

35
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:15,787
Thank you.

36
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,838
- I told you, I've given up.
- Try harder.

37
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,467
You live here?

38
00:05:28,878 --> 00:05:31,073
Just arrived from New York.

39
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:33,715
Taking a vacation?

40
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:35,683
I'm on an expedition.

41
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,116
Where's your baggage?

42
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,985
- Where are you staying?
- I'm a waif.

43
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:46,117
A red bus.

44
00:05:47,864 --> 00:05:52,198
Policeman or "bobby."
Observe the distinctive helmet.

45
00:05:53,836 --> 00:05:56,361
Saint Paul's Cathedral.
Please note the famous dome.

46
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,273
- This is a truly magnificent tour.
- It's the London tourists never get to see.

47
00:06:00,343 --> 00:06:03,176
- What's this?
- I've no idea.

48
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:27,699
They're all people
who died saving the lives of others.

49
00:06:29,372 --> 00:06:31,272
I've been here before.

50
00:06:40,883 --> 00:06:43,716
Twenty years ago, we came here.

51
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:48,947
My mother's dead. My father and I came here
the afternoon she died.

52
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:54,390
She was a smoker.
She died in the hospital, actually.

53
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,193
- Is your father still alive?
- Hanging on.

54
00:06:57,633 --> 00:06:58,930
He's in a home.

55
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:02,834
- You're late for work.
- You saying you want me to go?

56
00:07:02,905 --> 00:07:04,805
I'm saying you're late for work.

57
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,068
How did you end up writing obituaries?

58
00:07:08,377 --> 00:07:12,507
Well, I had dreams of being a writer,
but I had no voice.

59
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:15,515
What am I saying? I had no talent.

60
00:07:15,585 --> 00:07:19,851
So I ended up in obituaries,
which is the Siberia of journalism.

61
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:23,786
Tell me what you do.
I want to imagine you in Siberia.

62
00:07:23,859 --> 00:07:25,190
Really?

63
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:30,930
We call it "the obits page."

64
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:34,801
There's three of us: Me, Graham, and Harry.

65
00:07:35,404 --> 00:07:39,534
When I get to work, without fail...
Are you sure you want to know?

66
00:07:40,576 --> 00:07:44,672
Well, if someone important died,
we go to the "deep freeze"...

67
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,677
which is a computer file...

68
00:07:51,754 --> 00:07:55,019
with all the obituaries,
and we find the dead person's life.

69
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:57,753
People's obituaries are written
while they're still alive?

70
00:07:57,827 --> 00:07:59,419
Some people's.

71
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:03,056
Then Harry, he's the editor,
decides who we'll lead with.

72
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:05,327
Then we make calls, check facts.

73
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:09,963
At 6:00, we stand around the computer
and look at the next day's page...

74
00:08:10,773 --> 00:08:13,071
and make final changes.

75
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,207
Add a few euphemisms
for our own amusement.

76
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,610
Such as?

77
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:24,080
"He was a convivial fellow."
Meaning he was an alcoholic.

78
00:08:24,854 --> 00:08:28,255
"He valued his privacy." Gay.

79
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:31,488
"He enjoyed his privacy." Raging queen.

80
00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:34,754
What would my euphemism be?

81
00:08:35,731 --> 00:08:38,723
- "She was disarming."
- That's not a euphemism.

82
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,092
Yes, it is.

83
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:53,013
- What were you doing in New York?
- You know.

84
00:08:56,152 --> 00:09:00,555
Well, no, I don't. What, were you studying?

85
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:02,020
Stripping.

86
00:09:03,492 --> 00:09:05,722
Look at your little eyes.

87
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:08,694
I can't see my little eyes.

88
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,626
Why did you leave?

89
00:09:16,238 --> 00:09:18,229
Problems with a male.

90
00:09:18,507 --> 00:09:20,168
- Boyfriend?
- Kind of.

91
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:23,574
And you left him, just like that?

92
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:27,673
It's the only way to leave.
"I don't love you anymore. Goodbye."

93
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,947
- Supposing you do still love them?
- You don't leave.

94
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:34,950
- You've never left somebody you still love?
- No.

95
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:40,419
This is me.

96
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,497
Enjoy your stay.

97
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,002
Please remember
our traffic tends to come from the right.

98
00:09:54,777 --> 00:09:55,869
Bye.

99
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,591
Do you have a girlfriend?

100
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,291
Yeah. Ruth.

101
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,831
She's called Ruth. She's a linguist.

102
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:19,394
- What's your name?
- Alice.

103
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,970
My name is Alice Ayres.

104
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:31,139
Good.

105
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:34,410
I'm just gonna change the film.
Are you okay for time?

106
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,216
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Lf you must.

107
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,916
- I don't have to.
- Then don't.

108
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,734
I liked your book.

109
00:10:59,642 --> 00:11:00,802
Thanks.

110
00:11:02,711 --> 00:11:05,612
- When's it published?
- Next year. How come you've read it?

111
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:08,912
Your publisher sent me a manuscript.
I read it last night.

112
00:11:09,518 --> 00:11:11,452
You kept me up till 4:00.

113
00:11:12,488 --> 00:11:13,750
I'm flattered.

114
00:11:14,123 --> 00:11:16,591
Is your heroine
based on someone you know?

115
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:19,320
Yes. She's someone called Alice.

116
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:22,320
How does she feel
about you stealing her life?

117
00:11:22,398 --> 00:11:23,865
Borrowing her life.

118
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:26,593
I'm dedicating the book to her.
She's pleased.

119
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:36,876
Do you exhibit?

120
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,847
Sometimes. I have a thing next year.

121
00:11:45,855 --> 00:11:47,186
Portraits?

122
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:51,852
- Of who?
- Strangers.

123
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:58,322
How do your strangers feel
about you stealing their lives?

124
00:11:58,501 --> 00:11:59,900
Borrowing.

125
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,835
Am I a stranger?

126
00:12:03,772 --> 00:12:05,467
No. You're a job.

127
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:09,435
And you're a sloucher. Sit up.

128
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:17,552
You didn't find it obscene?

129
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,212
- What?
- The book.

130
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:22,683
I thought it was accurate.

131
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,792
About what?

132
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,392
About sex. About love.

133
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,163
In what way?

134
00:12:29,632 --> 00:12:32,829
- You wrote it.
- You read it till 4:00.

135
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:36,228
Don't raise your eyebrows.
It makes you look smug.

136
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:47,812
- But you did like it?
- Yes, but I could go off it.

137
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:55,587
Stand up.

138
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,695
Any criticisms?

139
00:13:05,301 --> 00:13:06,859
I'm not sure about the title.

140
00:13:06,936 --> 00:13:08,494
Got a better one?

141
00:13:09,438 --> 00:13:10,905
The Aquarium.

142
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:13,636
So you liked the filth.

143
00:13:13,976 --> 00:13:16,706
- You like aquariums.
- Fish are therapeutic.

144
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:19,145
- Hang out in aquariums, do you?
- When I can.

145
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:21,045
Good for picking up strangers?

146
00:13:21,116 --> 00:13:23,448
Photographing strangers.

147
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:34,426
Come here.

148
00:13:51,714 --> 00:13:53,375
You're beautiful.

149
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:03,388
I don't kiss strange men.

150
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:05,282
Neither do I.

151
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:19,294
Do you and this Alice live together?

152
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:25,437
Yes.

153
00:15:36,985 --> 00:15:38,384
Are you married?

154
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:39,785
Yes.

155
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,616
- No. Yes.
- Which?

156
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,619
Separated.

157
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,887
- Do you have any children?
- No.

158
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:49,954
- Would you like some?
- Yes, but not today.

159
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,031
Would Alice like children?

160
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:55,593
She's too young.

161
00:15:56,805 --> 00:16:00,297
She works in a café near here.
She's coming to meet me.

162
00:16:01,076 --> 00:16:02,475
Quite soon.

163
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:07,479
Why are you wasting her time?

164
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:11,450
- You're judgmental.
- You're devious.

165
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,217
I'm not wasting her time.
She's completely lovable.

166
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,121
And completely unleavable.

167
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:21,219
And you don't want someone else
getting their dirty hands on her.

168
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,355
- Men are crap.
- But all the same...

169
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:25,059
They're still crap.

170
00:16:26,835 --> 00:16:27,995
Your muse.

171
00:16:30,372 --> 00:16:33,364
- You've ruined my life.
- You'll get over it.

172
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,077
Dan.

173
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:46,685
Your shirt.

174
00:16:58,133 --> 00:16:59,828
You all done?

175
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:02,997
- How's the photographer?
- Good. Professional.

176
00:17:04,006 --> 00:17:06,372
Rigorous. Beady. One of your lot.

177
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:08,671
- What, female?
- Americano.

178
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:14,246
Come on.

179
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:25,054
Anna?

180
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,459
- Alice.
- Hi.

181
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:34,525
- Sorry to interrupt.
- No, we've just finished.

182
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,162
- Would you like some tea?
- No, thanks.

183
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:40,037
I've been serving it all day.
Can I use your loo?

184
00:17:40,108 --> 00:17:42,042
Sure. Just through there.

185
00:17:49,618 --> 00:17:50,915
She is beautiful.

186
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,045
- I've got to see you.
- No.

187
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:55,080
What's this? Patriotism?

188
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,988
- I don't want trouble.
- I'm not trouble.

189
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:58,458
You're taken.

190
00:18:00,596 --> 00:18:02,325
- I've got to see you.
- Tough.

191
00:18:02,397 --> 00:18:05,059
- You kissed me.
- What are you, 12?

192
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:10,735
I'm a block of ice.

193
00:18:14,076 --> 00:18:15,873
Will you take my photo?

194
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:18,640
I've never been photographed
by a professional before.

195
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:21,308
I'd really appreciate it. I can pay you.

196
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:23,112
No, I'd like to.

197
00:18:23,552 --> 00:18:25,383
Only if you don't mind.

198
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:27,182
Why should I?

199
00:18:27,256 --> 00:18:29,247
Because you'll have to go away.

200
00:18:29,324 --> 00:18:32,157
We don't want him here
while we're working, do we?

201
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:33,817
No, we don't.

202
00:18:36,832 --> 00:18:39,027
Right. I'll be in the pub on the corner.

203
00:18:39,101 --> 00:18:40,329
Have fun.

204
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:44,903
Thank you.

205
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,505
- Good luck with your exhibition.
- Good luck with your book.

206
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:06,221
So you've got an exhibition?

207
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:08,322
Yeah.

208
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:14,699
I read Dan's book.

209
00:19:15,804 --> 00:19:18,602
You've had quite a life.

210
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:21,373
Thanks.

211
00:19:27,449 --> 00:19:29,610
He said you work in a café?

212
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,582
I am a waitress.

213
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,649
That's a temporary thing?

214
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:35,612
No.

215
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:42,186
Why don't you come over here and sit?

216
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:02,516
- You live here?
- I do now.

217
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,581
Because you're single?

218
00:20:05,187 --> 00:20:07,451
Who was your last boyfriend?

219
00:20:08,023 --> 00:20:09,285
My husband.

220
00:20:09,358 --> 00:20:10,950
Was he English?

221
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,988
- Very.
- What happened to him?

222
00:20:15,564 --> 00:20:17,191
Someone younger.

223
00:20:19,534 --> 00:20:22,401
You've got a great face.

224
00:20:23,638 --> 00:20:25,299
Doesn't everyone?

225
00:20:26,675 --> 00:20:28,165
I suppose so.

226
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,601
I just...

227
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:32,613
From the book,
somehow I thought you'd be less...

228
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:34,241
What?

229
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:39,413
I don't know what, exactly.

230
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,929
How do you feel about him using your life?

231
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:59,073
It's really none of your business.

232
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,780
When he let me in downstairs...

233
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:09,343
he had this look.

234
00:21:11,753 --> 00:21:14,187
I just listened to your conversation.

235
00:21:18,927 --> 00:21:20,861
I don't know what to say.

236
00:21:24,699 --> 00:21:26,530
I'm not a thief, Alice.

237
00:21:33,575 --> 00:21:34,667
Do you want a drink?

238
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:37,234
I have some vodka in the fridge.
We could have a drink.

239
00:21:37,312 --> 00:21:39,143
Just take my picture.

240
00:22:00,302 --> 00:22:01,360
Good.

241
00:24:00,287 --> 00:24:01,379
Shit.

242
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:35,552
What's the histology?

243
00:24:41,462 --> 00:24:42,793
Progressive?

244
00:24:43,531 --> 00:24:45,658
No. Sounds like an atrophy.

245
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,561
Okay. Bye.

246
00:25:02,883 --> 00:25:04,214
Bollocks.

247
00:26:37,811 --> 00:26:39,142
Jesus.

248
00:29:19,206 --> 00:29:20,468
Anna?

249
00:29:24,645 --> 00:29:26,306
I got the coat.

250
00:29:27,081 --> 00:29:28,639
The white coat.

251
00:29:30,784 --> 00:29:32,115
So I see.

252
00:29:33,187 --> 00:29:35,519
I'm Larry. The doctor.

253
00:29:35,823 --> 00:29:37,120
Hello, Dr. Larry.

254
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:40,126
Feel free to call me "The Sultan."

255
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:48,935
I can't believe these things actually happen.

256
00:29:49,303 --> 00:29:51,771
I thought if you showed up,
you'd be an old trout.

257
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:54,740
But you are bloody gorgeous.

258
00:29:55,709 --> 00:29:57,301
Well, thank you.

259
00:29:59,446 --> 00:30:02,244
Fish. You gotta respect them.

260
00:30:03,584 --> 00:30:05,415
- Have you?
- Of course.

261
00:30:06,053 --> 00:30:08,613
We were fish. Long ago.

262
00:30:09,023 --> 00:30:10,923
Before we were apes.

263
00:30:14,628 --> 00:30:16,562
You mentioned a hotel.

264
00:30:17,064 --> 00:30:18,554
No rush.

265
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:23,666
Actually, there is.
I've got to be in surgery by 3:00.

266
00:30:24,371 --> 00:30:28,000
- Are you having an operation?
- No, I'm doing one.

267
00:30:28,842 --> 00:30:31,538
- Are you really a doctor?
- I said I was.

268
00:30:32,713 --> 00:30:34,374
You are Anna?

269
00:30:36,684 --> 00:30:40,142
I'm sorry. Did I photograph you?

270
00:30:40,487 --> 00:30:42,114
Did we meet somewhere?

271
00:30:42,189 --> 00:30:45,852
Come on. Don't play games,
you nymph of the Net.

272
00:30:46,293 --> 00:30:48,818
- Excuse me?
- You were up for it yesterday.

273
00:30:48,896 --> 00:30:52,195
- Was I?
- Yeah. "Wear my wet knickers.

274
00:30:53,167 --> 00:30:54,998
"Sit on my face.

275
00:30:56,036 --> 00:30:58,732
- "Cum-hungry bitch."
- Okay.

276
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:03,403
Why do I feel like a pervert?

277
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,806
I think you're the victim of a practical joke.

278
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:15,213
- I am so sorry.
- It's okay.

279
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,520
No.

280
00:31:21,962 --> 00:31:24,590
We spoke on the Net last night.
Now you've seen me...

281
00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:25,996
I wasn't on the Net last night.

282
00:31:26,066 --> 00:31:28,159
Where were you
between 6:45 and 7:00 p.m.?

283
00:31:28,235 --> 00:31:29,827
That's really none of your business.

284
00:31:29,903 --> 00:31:32,872
- Where were you?
- On the Net, talking to you.

285
00:31:33,674 --> 00:31:37,269
- Well, I was talking to someone.
- Someone pretending to be me.

286
00:31:40,814 --> 00:31:43,408
I think you were talking to Daniel Woolf.

287
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:46,544
- Who?
- This guy I know. It's him.

288
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,054
- No, I was talking to a woman.
- How do you know?

289
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:51,785
Believe me, she was a woman.
I got a huge...

290
00:31:51,859 --> 00:31:54,657
She was a... She wasn't, was she?

291
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:56,189
No.

292
00:31:56,563 --> 00:31:58,428
What a bastard.

293
00:32:03,871 --> 00:32:05,600
How do you know him?

294
00:32:05,672 --> 00:32:09,802
I don't really know him.
I took his photograph for a book he wrote.

295
00:32:09,877 --> 00:32:12,675
- I hope it sank without a trace.
- It's on its way.

296
00:32:12,746 --> 00:32:14,941
There is justice in the world.

297
00:32:15,482 --> 00:32:17,143
What's it called?

298
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,960
The Aquarium.

299
00:32:28,028 --> 00:32:31,361
What a prick! He's advertising.

300
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,960
But why would he pretend to be you?

301
00:32:36,904 --> 00:32:38,394
I think he likes me.

302
00:32:38,505 --> 00:32:41,133
Funny way of showing it.
Can't he send you flowers?

303
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:43,836
Extraordinary thing, the Internet.

304
00:32:44,044 --> 00:32:46,808
Possibility of genuine
global communication.

305
00:32:47,214 --> 00:32:49,341
The first great democratic medium.

306
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:52,112
Absolutely. It's the future.

307
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:54,851
Two guys wanking in cyberspace.

308
00:32:55,255 --> 00:32:57,018
He was the wanker.

309
00:32:58,459 --> 00:33:00,791
I'll say this for him, he can write.

310
00:33:02,396 --> 00:33:03,761
Is he in love with you?

311
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:06,061
I don't know. No.

312
00:33:06,633 --> 00:33:09,466
- Are you in love with him?
- I hardly know him.

313
00:33:09,536 --> 00:33:11,697
But you're sort of interested.

314
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:14,171
I think he's interesting.

315
00:33:14,475 --> 00:33:16,943
No, don't. I look like a criminal in photos.

316
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,910
Please. It's my birthday.

317
00:33:19,146 --> 00:33:20,272
Really?

318
00:33:21,081 --> 00:33:22,343
Really.

319
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,027
Happy birthday.

320
00:33:41,201 --> 00:33:42,259
Thank you.

321
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:45,768
This man comes into the café today
and he says:

322
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:48,933
"Hey, waitress, what are you waiting for?"

323
00:33:49,409 --> 00:33:50,740
Funny guy.

324
00:33:51,178 --> 00:33:54,670
So I go,
"I'm waiting for a man to come in here...

325
00:33:55,115 --> 00:33:58,642
"and fuck me sideways
with a beautiful line like that."

326
00:33:59,052 --> 00:34:00,542
What did he do?

327
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:03,181
Asked for a cup of tea with two sugars.

328
00:34:14,735 --> 00:34:17,169
- I'm waiting for you.
- To do what?

329
00:34:19,373 --> 00:34:20,704
Leave me.

330
00:34:21,675 --> 00:34:25,543
I'm not going to leave you.
I totally love you. Why is this?

331
00:34:26,613 --> 00:34:29,741
Please let me come.
I want to be there for you.

332
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:33,284
- Are you ashamed of me?
- Of course not. I told you...

333
00:34:33,353 --> 00:34:35,753
- I want to be alone.
- Why?

334
00:34:37,891 --> 00:34:39,415
To grieve.

335
00:34:40,194 --> 00:34:41,684
To think.

336
00:34:44,264 --> 00:34:47,427
- I love you. Why won't you let me?
- It's only a weekend.

337
00:34:47,701 --> 00:34:49,965
Why won't you let me love you?

338
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,871
Buster.

339
00:35:00,814 --> 00:35:02,679
Let's go to this thing...

340
00:35:02,883 --> 00:35:05,613
then I'll get my train. I'll be away one night.

341
00:35:05,953 --> 00:35:08,615
I'll be back before you know it, okay?

342
00:35:38,418 --> 00:35:40,648
Do these people pay you?
Or do you pay them?

343
00:36:06,947 --> 00:36:08,278
Like it?

344
00:36:11,051 --> 00:36:12,382
No.

345
00:36:14,488 --> 00:36:16,547
What were you so sad about?

346
00:36:17,491 --> 00:36:19,857
- Life.
- What's that, then?

347
00:36:23,163 --> 00:36:26,064
So what do you reckon, in general?

348
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:28,230
You want to talk about art?

349
00:36:28,302 --> 00:36:31,703
I know it's vulgar to discuss The Work
at an opening of The Work...

350
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,899
but someone's got to do it.

351
00:36:35,909 --> 00:36:38,377
I'm serious. What do you think?

352
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:41,069
It's a lie.

353
00:36:41,748 --> 00:36:45,377
It's a bunch of sad strangers
photographed beautifully...

354
00:36:45,852 --> 00:36:50,186
and all the glittering assholes
who appreciate art...

355
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:53,982
say it's beautiful
because that's what they want to see.

356
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:56,552
But the people in the photos are sad...

357
00:36:57,431 --> 00:36:58,796
and alone.

358
00:36:58,865 --> 00:37:02,528
But the pictures
make the world seem beautiful...

359
00:37:02,602 --> 00:37:07,005
so the exhibition's reassuring,
which makes it a lie.

360
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:10,203
And everyone loves a big, fat lie.

361
00:37:10,644 --> 00:37:14,205
- I'm the big, fat liar's boyfriend.
- Bastard.

362
00:37:14,281 --> 00:37:16,249
- Larry.
- Alice.

363
00:37:19,353 --> 00:37:21,014
So you're Anna's boyfriend.

364
00:37:21,088 --> 00:37:22,953
A princess can kiss a toad.

365
00:37:23,023 --> 00:37:24,115
- Frog.
- Toad.

366
00:37:24,191 --> 00:37:27,354
- Frog.
- Toad, frog, lobster. They're all the same.

367
00:37:28,729 --> 00:37:31,220
So how long have you been seeing her?

368
00:37:31,298 --> 00:37:34,028
Four months. We're in the first flush.

369
00:37:34,735 --> 00:37:38,398
It's paradise. All my nasty habits amuse her.

370
00:37:38,705 --> 00:37:40,935
- You shouldn't smoke.
- Fuck off.

371
00:37:41,007 --> 00:37:43,567
I'm a doctor.
I'm supposed to say things like that.

372
00:37:43,643 --> 00:37:45,543
- You want one?
- No.

373
00:37:46,346 --> 00:37:48,007
Yes. No.

374
00:37:48,382 --> 00:37:50,077
Fuck it, yes.

375
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,182
No.

376
00:37:53,687 --> 00:37:55,177
I've given up.

377
00:37:57,524 --> 00:38:00,425
Anna tells me your bloke wrote a book.

378
00:38:00,494 --> 00:38:03,190
- Any good?
- Of course.

379
00:38:03,797 --> 00:38:05,788
It's about you, isn't it?

380
00:38:06,299 --> 00:38:09,462
- Some of me.
- Oh? What did he leave out?

381
00:38:10,771 --> 00:38:12,432
The truth.

382
00:38:13,373 --> 00:38:15,068
Is he here, your bloke?

383
00:38:15,142 --> 00:38:18,236
Yeah, he's over there talking to your bird.

384
00:38:21,782 --> 00:38:23,682
My boyfriend's here.

385
00:38:24,684 --> 00:38:26,345
He's here? Where?

386
00:38:28,188 --> 00:38:29,348
There.

387
00:38:30,357 --> 00:38:31,688
With Alice?

388
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:34,320
I believe you're acquainted.

389
00:38:38,632 --> 00:38:41,430
- I've never seen him before.
- No.

390
00:38:42,602 --> 00:38:44,001
But you've spoken.

391
00:38:44,337 --> 00:38:46,328
Well, conversed.

392
00:38:47,207 --> 00:38:49,767
- Corresponded.
- I wrote to him?

393
00:38:50,544 --> 00:38:54,605
On the Net. You sent him to the aquarium.
I happened to be there.

394
00:38:55,348 --> 00:38:57,145
Nice work, Cupid.

395
00:39:01,021 --> 00:39:03,888
- We need to talk about this.
- No, we don't.

396
00:39:04,024 --> 00:39:05,582
He's very pretty.

397
00:39:06,626 --> 00:39:09,288
She is very tall.

398
00:39:14,334 --> 00:39:16,268
So you're a stripper?

399
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,230
Yeah.

400
00:39:18,972 --> 00:39:20,132
And?

401
00:39:43,029 --> 00:39:44,690
You take care, now.

402
00:39:45,065 --> 00:39:46,362
I will.

403
00:39:46,766 --> 00:39:48,199
You, too.

404
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:59,101
That's the way it should be.

405
00:40:02,749 --> 00:40:04,239
He's very funny.

406
00:40:09,322 --> 00:40:11,256
Excuse me. Nice to meet you.

407
00:40:18,331 --> 00:40:20,799
- Pleased with the success?
- Yes, absolutely.

408
00:40:21,635 --> 00:40:23,626
Yours was the best.

409
00:40:24,104 --> 00:40:26,129
You were the belle of the bullshit.

410
00:40:26,206 --> 00:40:27,901
Who were those awful people?

411
00:40:27,974 --> 00:40:31,068
- Where do they come from?
- Why should we care?

412
00:40:35,215 --> 00:40:38,651
- You get this one. You'll miss your train.
- I'll be fine.

413
00:40:39,185 --> 00:40:40,675
Come on, it's cold.

414
00:40:47,193 --> 00:40:49,024
I'll see you on Sunday.

415
00:40:54,367 --> 00:40:55,857
Where to, love?

416
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,200
Taxi!

417
00:41:12,352 --> 00:41:13,512
Sorry.

418
00:41:13,853 --> 00:41:16,515
Why don't you make up
your bleeding mind?

419
00:41:22,128 --> 00:41:24,961
Thank you so much.
I appreciate your coming.

420
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:27,295
I'll call you tomorrow. See you next week.

421
00:41:27,367 --> 00:41:29,301
- Thanks.
- Thanks very much.

422
00:41:32,706 --> 00:41:35,038
- I thought you'd gone.
- I forgot this.

423
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:41,146
So he's a dermatologist.
Can you get more boring than that?

424
00:41:41,214 --> 00:41:44,183
- Obituarist?
- Failed novelist, please.

425
00:41:45,018 --> 00:41:46,781
I was sorry about your book.

426
00:41:46,853 --> 00:41:49,014
Thanks. I blame the title.

427
00:41:49,322 --> 00:41:52,519
So we pull out our Christmas crackers
with those appalling jokes.

428
00:41:52,592 --> 00:41:55,288
My guy says,
"Hang on. These are second-rate jokes.

429
00:41:55,362 --> 00:41:58,854
"I've got a first-rate joke.
Sit back and take notice."

430
00:41:58,932 --> 00:42:01,730
So we go, "Okay, what's the joke?"
And he says:

431
00:42:02,002 --> 00:42:03,765
"It's based on A Christmas Carol...

432
00:42:03,837 --> 00:42:06,203
"which is why it seems
so relevant on Christmas Day."

433
00:42:06,272 --> 00:42:08,638
I haven't even seen you for a year.

434
00:42:08,708 --> 00:42:09,834
Yes, you have.

435
00:42:09,909 --> 00:42:12,309
Only because you stalk me
outside my studio.

436
00:42:12,379 --> 00:42:14,438
I don't stalk. I lurk.

437
00:42:14,514 --> 00:42:16,709
And when I'm not there you look for me.

438
00:42:16,783 --> 00:42:20,275
- How do you know if you're not there?
- Because I am there...

439
00:42:20,954 --> 00:42:22,649
lurking from a distance.

440
00:42:31,331 --> 00:42:32,662
Look at me.

441
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,561
Tell me you're not in love with me.

442
00:42:36,336 --> 00:42:38,497
I'm not in love with you.

443
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,802
You just lied.

444
00:42:49,182 --> 00:42:51,776
I'm your stranger. Jump.

445
00:43:20,146 --> 00:43:22,910
- Hello, stranger.
- Hello.

446
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:25,574
Intense conversation?

447
00:43:27,954 --> 00:43:29,785
His father died.

448
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:32,380
Were you spying?

449
00:43:32,459 --> 00:43:34,324
Lovingly observing...

450
00:43:34,594 --> 00:43:36,152
with a telescope.

451
00:43:38,465 --> 00:43:40,524
He's taller than in his photo.

452
00:43:41,134 --> 00:43:42,965
His photo's a headshot.

453
00:43:43,036 --> 00:43:44,628
Yeah, I know.

454
00:43:44,704 --> 00:43:48,640
But his head implied a short body,
when, in fact, his head is deceptive.

455
00:43:48,842 --> 00:43:49,866
Deceptive?

456
00:43:49,943 --> 00:43:53,344
He's actually got a long body.
He's a stringy fucker.

457
00:43:54,481 --> 00:43:56,039
I could have him.

458
00:43:57,016 --> 00:44:00,508
- What?
- Lf it came to it, in a scrap, I could have him.

459
00:44:01,955 --> 00:44:04,389
Did you tell him we call him Cupid?

460
00:44:05,091 --> 00:44:07,855
No, that's our joke.

461
00:44:09,796 --> 00:44:12,060
I had a chat with young Alice.

462
00:44:12,132 --> 00:44:13,861
- Fancy her?
- Of course.

463
00:44:13,967 --> 00:44:15,696
- Not as much as you.
- Why not?

464
00:44:15,769 --> 00:44:17,737
You're a woman. She's a girl.

465
00:44:17,804 --> 00:44:21,296
She has the moronic beauty of youth,
but she's sly.

466
00:44:21,541 --> 00:44:25,033
- She seems open to me.
- That's how she wants to seem.

467
00:44:25,111 --> 00:44:28,638
You forget you're dealing with
a clinical observer of the human carnival.

468
00:44:28,715 --> 00:44:30,546
- Am I, now?
- Yes.

469
00:44:30,617 --> 00:44:34,553
You seem more like the cat
that got the cream. Stop licking yourself.

470
00:44:40,193 --> 00:44:43,356
That's the nastiest thing
you've ever said to me.

471
00:44:46,866 --> 00:44:48,458
That's horrible.

472
00:44:48,701 --> 00:44:50,168
I'm sorry.

473
00:44:51,538 --> 00:44:53,199
I'm so sorry.

474
00:45:41,421 --> 00:45:44,288
- Where have you been?
- Work thing.

475
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:48,350
Had a drink with Harry.
You never have one drink with Harry.

476
00:45:48,428 --> 00:45:51,397
- You know he's in love with you.
- No, he's not.

477
00:45:52,398 --> 00:45:53,695
Is he?

478
00:45:55,568 --> 00:45:57,263
Did you eat?

479
00:45:57,537 --> 00:45:59,767
I'll make you something.

480
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,301
I'm not hungry.

481
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,422
What?

482
00:46:29,135 --> 00:46:30,625
This will hurt.

483
00:46:31,638 --> 00:46:33,367
I've been with Anna.

484
00:46:34,207 --> 00:46:35,902
I'm in love with her.

485
00:46:36,943 --> 00:46:39,571
We've been seeing each other for a year.

486
00:46:39,913 --> 00:46:41,881
It began at her opening.

487
00:46:58,031 --> 00:47:00,192
- Have a nice one.
- Cheers, guvnor.

488
00:47:22,922 --> 00:47:24,253
Don't move.

489
00:47:25,258 --> 00:47:27,317
I want to remember this moment forever.

490
00:47:27,393 --> 00:47:30,726
First time I walked through the door,
returning from a business trip...

491
00:47:30,797 --> 00:47:33,595
to be greeted by my wife.

492
00:47:34,067 --> 00:47:36,763
I have, in this moment, become an adult.

493
00:47:37,036 --> 00:47:39,596
Thanks for waiting up, you darling.

494
00:47:41,374 --> 00:47:43,035
You goddess.

495
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,872
I missed you.

496
00:47:49,282 --> 00:47:50,977
How about some tea?

497
00:47:51,351 --> 00:47:53,342
Jesus, I'm knackered!

498
00:47:53,419 --> 00:47:55,444
- Didn't you sleep on the plane?
- No...

499
00:47:55,521 --> 00:47:59,582
because the permed German next to me
was snoring like a Messerschmitt.

500
00:47:59,659 --> 00:48:02,059
- What's the time?
- About midnight.

501
00:48:02,195 --> 00:48:04,629
Time. What a tricky little fucker.

502
00:48:05,365 --> 00:48:08,698
My head's in two places.
My brain actually hurts.

503
00:48:08,768 --> 00:48:11,760
- Do you want some food?
- No, I need a bath.

504
00:48:12,205 --> 00:48:15,333
- I'll run it for you.
- No, I'll have a shower.

505
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:17,039
You okay?

506
00:48:17,777 --> 00:48:19,176
How was the thing?

507
00:48:19,245 --> 00:48:22,408
As dermatological conferences go,
it was a riot.

508
00:48:23,316 --> 00:48:24,908
How was the hotel?

509
00:48:25,251 --> 00:48:28,880
Someone told me that
the beautiful people of the Paranoid Hotel...

510
00:48:28,955 --> 00:48:32,891
the concierge, the bellboys and girls...
Did you know this?

511
00:48:33,192 --> 00:48:35,990
- They're all whores.
- Everybody knows that.

512
00:48:36,662 --> 00:48:37,822
I didn't.

513
00:48:40,433 --> 00:48:43,425
I don't suppose you'd fancy a friendly poke.

514
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:45,531
I just had a bath.

515
00:48:47,073 --> 00:48:48,404
Right.

516
00:48:49,042 --> 00:48:51,977
I'll see to myself, then,
in the Elle Decoration bathroom.

517
00:48:52,045 --> 00:48:55,572
- You chose that bathroom.
- And every time I wash in it I feel dirty.

518
00:48:55,648 --> 00:48:58,082
It's cleaner than I am. It's got attitude.

519
00:48:58,151 --> 00:49:00,119
The mirror says, "Who the fuck are you?"

520
00:49:00,186 --> 00:49:02,848
- You chose it.
- Doesn't mean I like it.

521
00:49:03,022 --> 00:49:04,887
We shouldn't have this.

522
00:49:04,957 --> 00:49:06,788
I hear middle-class guilt.

523
00:49:06,859 --> 00:49:10,795
Working-class guilt.
Why are you dressed if you just had a bath?

524
00:49:12,365 --> 00:49:14,060
We needed some milk.

525
00:49:15,168 --> 00:49:16,396
You okay?

526
00:49:17,437 --> 00:49:19,166
- You?
- Yeah.

527
00:49:23,409 --> 00:49:24,740
I'm going.

528
00:49:25,078 --> 00:49:27,410
- I'm sorry.
- Irrelevant.

529
00:49:28,614 --> 00:49:30,445
What are you sorry for?

530
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,240
Everything.

531
00:49:32,452 --> 00:49:35,444
- Why didn't you tell me before?
- Cowardice.

532
00:49:37,323 --> 00:49:39,120
Is it because she's successful?

533
00:49:39,192 --> 00:49:42,355
No, it's because she doesn't need me.

534
00:49:45,798 --> 00:49:47,459
Did you bring her here?

535
00:49:49,869 --> 00:49:50,858
Yes.

536
00:49:54,807 --> 00:49:57,901
- Didn't she get married?
- She stopped seeing me.

537
00:49:58,478 --> 00:50:00,571
Is that when we went to the country?

538
00:50:00,646 --> 00:50:03,308
To celebrate our third anniversary?

539
00:50:05,017 --> 00:50:08,145
Did you phone her? Beg her to come back?

540
00:50:08,721 --> 00:50:11,383
- When you went for your long, lonely walks?
- Yes.

541
00:50:11,457 --> 00:50:12,822
You're a piece of shit.

542
00:50:12,892 --> 00:50:15,918
Deception is brutal.
I'm not pretending otherwise.

543
00:50:15,995 --> 00:50:17,155
How?

544
00:50:17,463 --> 00:50:18,953
How does it work?

545
00:50:20,466 --> 00:50:22,627
How do you do this to someone?

546
00:50:24,403 --> 00:50:26,064
Not good enough.

547
00:50:27,373 --> 00:50:30,740
- I fell in love with her, Alice.
- As if you had no choice?

548
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:32,744
There's a moment. There's always a moment.

549
00:50:32,812 --> 00:50:35,975
"I can do this, I can give in to this,
or I can resist it."

550
00:50:36,048 --> 00:50:40,041
And I don't know when your moment was,
but I bet you there was one.

551
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:41,552
I'm going.

552
00:50:44,323 --> 00:50:46,757
- It's not safe out there.
- And it's safe in here?

553
00:50:46,826 --> 00:50:48,691
What about your things?

554
00:50:48,961 --> 00:50:51,691
- I don't need things.
- Where will you go?

555
00:50:51,964 --> 00:50:53,295
Disappear.

556
00:50:56,135 --> 00:50:58,968
The Sultan has returned bearing gifts.

557
00:51:01,974 --> 00:51:03,305
Thank you.

558
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,013
They're beautiful.

559
00:51:10,082 --> 00:51:12,983
Here's a thing. Alice was at the hotel.

560
00:51:13,753 --> 00:51:14,742
What?

561
00:51:14,887 --> 00:51:17,685
They sell these arty postcards in the lobby.

562
00:51:17,957 --> 00:51:20,391
I bought one to boost your sales.

563
00:51:22,628 --> 00:51:25,290
"Young Woman, London."

564
00:51:26,732 --> 00:51:31,533
And I checked for your book
in The Museum of Modern Art. It was there.

565
00:51:32,505 --> 00:51:34,200
Someone bought one.

566
00:51:34,407 --> 00:51:37,069
This guy with a ridiculous little beard.

567
00:51:37,143 --> 00:51:41,807
He was drooling over your photo on
the inside cover. He fancied you, the geek.

568
00:51:42,014 --> 00:51:45,177
I was so proud of you.
You've broken New York.

569
00:51:45,851 --> 00:51:47,341
You're wonderful.

570
00:51:48,487 --> 00:51:50,318
Don't ever forget it.

571
00:51:54,227 --> 00:51:56,058
Can I still see you?

572
00:52:00,566 --> 00:52:03,535
Dan, can I still see you? Answer me.

573
00:52:03,603 --> 00:52:06,333
I can't see you.
If I see you, I'll never leave you.

574
00:52:06,405 --> 00:52:09,806
- What will you do if I find someone else?
- Be jealous.

575
00:52:11,677 --> 00:52:13,668
You still fancy me?

576
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:15,911
Of course.

577
00:52:16,849 --> 00:52:18,146
You're lying.

578
00:52:19,418 --> 00:52:20,976
I've been you.

579
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:25,751
Will you hold me?

580
00:52:31,631 --> 00:52:35,158
- I amuse you, but I bore you.
- No.

581
00:52:36,569 --> 00:52:38,434
You did love me?

582
00:52:39,338 --> 00:52:42,000
I'll always love you. I hate hurting you.

583
00:52:42,208 --> 00:52:43,766
Then why are you?

584
00:52:45,011 --> 00:52:46,945
'Cause I'm selfish.

585
00:52:47,413 --> 00:52:50,644
- And I think I'll be happier with her.
- You won't.

586
00:52:51,317 --> 00:52:53,148
You'll miss me.

587
00:52:54,153 --> 00:52:56,917
No one will ever love you as much as I do.

588
00:52:58,224 --> 00:53:00,385
Why isn't love enough?

589
00:53:01,794 --> 00:53:05,457
I'm the one who leaves.
I'm supposed to leave you.

590
00:53:20,479 --> 00:53:22,538
Make some tea, buster.

591
00:54:13,566 --> 00:54:15,261
Why are you dressed?

592
00:54:18,704 --> 00:54:21,070
Because I think
you might be about to leave me...

593
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:24,200
and I didn't want to be wearing
a dressing gown.

594
00:54:27,113 --> 00:54:29,445
I slept with someone in New York.

595
00:54:30,683 --> 00:54:32,014
A whore.

596
00:54:33,352 --> 00:54:34,649
I'm sorry.

597
00:54:39,024 --> 00:54:40,855
Why did you tell me?

598
00:54:41,794 --> 00:54:44,592
- I couldn't lie to you.
- Why not?

599
00:54:45,931 --> 00:54:47,592
Because I love you.

600
00:55:03,349 --> 00:55:04,680
It's fine.

601
00:55:05,551 --> 00:55:07,542
Really? Why?

602
00:55:12,625 --> 00:55:14,320
Something's wrong.

603
00:55:18,764 --> 00:55:20,095
Tell me.

604
00:55:23,602 --> 00:55:25,433
Are you leaving me?

605
00:55:29,842 --> 00:55:31,503
Because of this?

606
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,340
Why?

607
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:38,781
Dan.

608
00:55:40,853 --> 00:55:42,150
Cupid?

609
00:55:43,989 --> 00:55:45,581
He's our joke.

610
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:47,890
I love him.

611
00:55:49,295 --> 00:55:51,229
You're seeing him now?

612
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,191
Since when?

613
00:56:00,739 --> 00:56:03,572
Since my opening last year.

614
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,502
I'm disgusting.

615
00:56:09,181 --> 00:56:10,773
You're phenomenal.

616
00:56:12,384 --> 00:56:14,045
You're so clever.

617
00:56:16,455 --> 00:56:18,218
Why did you marry me?

618
00:56:19,925 --> 00:56:22,416
I stopped seeing him. I wanted us to work.

619
00:56:22,495 --> 00:56:25,487
- Why did you tell me you wanted children?
- Because I did.

620
00:56:25,564 --> 00:56:28,397
- And now you want children with him?
- Yes.

621
00:56:30,536 --> 00:56:32,094
I don't know.

622
00:56:35,608 --> 00:56:37,132
But we're happy...

623
00:56:38,344 --> 00:56:39,675
aren't we?

624
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:47,612
- You're gonna go live with him?
- You stay here if you want.

625
00:56:47,686 --> 00:56:50,280
I don't give a fuck about the spoils.

626
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:55,387
You did this to me the day we met.
You let me hang myself for your amusement.

627
00:56:55,461 --> 00:56:57,952
Why didn't you just tell me
when I walked in the door?

628
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:01,193
- I was scared.
- You're a coward, you spoilt bitch.

629
00:57:03,335 --> 00:57:06,532
Are you dressed
because you thought I might hit you?

630
00:57:09,141 --> 00:57:10,733
What do you think I am?

631
00:57:10,809 --> 00:57:13,209
- I've been hit before.
- Not by me.

632
00:57:15,915 --> 00:57:17,644
Is he a good fuck?

633
00:57:19,151 --> 00:57:20,675
Don't do this.

634
00:57:21,153 --> 00:57:23,144
Just answer the question.

635
00:57:23,389 --> 00:57:25,050
Is he good?

636
00:57:25,391 --> 00:57:26,722
Yes.

637
00:57:29,228 --> 00:57:30,820
Better than me?

638
00:57:31,163 --> 00:57:33,222
- Different.
- Better?

639
00:57:35,935 --> 00:57:38,267
- Gentler.
- What does that mean?

640
00:57:39,138 --> 00:57:41,231
- You know what it means.
- Tell me.

641
00:57:41,307 --> 00:57:42,865
- No.
- I treat you like a whore?

642
00:57:42,942 --> 00:57:45,172
- Sometimes.
- Why would that be?

643
00:57:46,211 --> 00:57:48,611
- I'm sorry, you're...
- Don't say it.

644
00:57:48,847 --> 00:57:50,474
Don't you fucking say:

645
00:57:50,549 --> 00:57:53,347
"You're too good for me."
I am, but don't say it.

646
00:57:53,419 --> 00:57:56,081
You're making the mistake of your life.

647
00:57:57,890 --> 00:58:01,382
You're leaving me because you believe
that you don't deserve happiness...

648
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,052
but you do, Anna.

649
00:58:05,998 --> 00:58:09,024
Did you have a bath
because you had sex with him?

650
00:58:09,768 --> 00:58:11,895
So you wouldn't smell of him?

651
00:58:13,305 --> 00:58:15,466
So you'd feel less guilty?

652
00:58:16,642 --> 00:58:18,234
How do you feel?

653
00:58:18,911 --> 00:58:20,401
Guilty.

654
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,711
Did you ever love me?

655
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:25,743
Yes.

656
00:58:58,350 --> 00:59:00,181
Did you do it here?

657
00:59:02,488 --> 00:59:03,648
No.

658
00:59:04,089 --> 00:59:05,420
Why not?

659
00:59:07,893 --> 00:59:09,656
Do you wish we did?

660
00:59:09,728 --> 00:59:11,525
Just tell me the truth.

661
00:59:13,432 --> 00:59:15,263
Yes, we did it here.

662
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:19,430
Where?

663
00:59:24,476 --> 00:59:25,636
There.

664
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:29,511
On this?

665
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:36,017
We had our first fuck on this.

666
00:59:36,822 --> 00:59:38,517
Did you think of me?

667
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,691
When?

668
00:59:45,764 --> 00:59:47,664
When did you do it here?

669
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,525
- Answer the question!
- This evening.

670
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,773
Did you come?

671
00:59:58,977 --> 01:00:02,037
- Why are you doing this?
- 'Cause I want to know.

672
01:00:03,215 --> 01:00:05,445
- Yes, I came.
- How many times?

673
01:00:05,517 --> 01:00:07,382
- Twice.
- How?

674
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:11,515
- First he went down on me, then we fucked.
- Who was where?

675
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:14,525
I was on top,
then he fucked me from behind.

676
01:00:14,593 --> 01:00:17,460
- That's when you came the second time?
- God.

677
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:22,030
- Why is the sex so important?
- Because I'm a fucking caveman!

678
01:00:22,568 --> 01:00:24,661
Did you touch yourself
while he fucked you?

679
01:00:25,037 --> 01:00:26,561
- You wank for him?
- Sometimes.

680
01:00:26,638 --> 01:00:28,503
- And he does?
- We do everything...

681
01:00:28,574 --> 01:00:31,304
- that people who have sex do.
- You enjoy sucking him off?

682
01:00:31,376 --> 01:00:32,604
- You like his cock?
- I love it.

683
01:00:32,678 --> 01:00:34,202
- Like him coming in your face?
- Yes!

684
01:00:34,279 --> 01:00:36,747
- What does it taste like?
- Like you, but sweeter.

685
01:00:36,815 --> 01:00:40,273
That's the spirit. Thank you.
Thank you for your honesty.

686
01:00:40,352 --> 01:00:42,320
Now fuck off and die...

687
01:00:43,288 --> 01:00:45,153
you fucked-up slag.

688
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:10,132
I love you.

689
01:02:11,977 --> 01:02:13,467
Thank you.

690
01:02:15,814 --> 01:02:19,306
- What's this room called?
- The Paradise Suite.

691
01:02:19,585 --> 01:02:22,520
- How many Paradise Suites are there?
- Eight.

692
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:29,988
Do I have to pay you to talk to me?

693
01:02:30,062 --> 01:02:32,963
No. But if you want to tip me,
you're welcome.

694
01:02:38,136 --> 01:02:39,433
Thank you.

695
01:02:40,572 --> 01:02:44,235
I used to come here a million years ago.
It was a punk club.

696
01:02:44,443 --> 01:02:46,308
The stage was...

697
01:02:49,615 --> 01:02:52,277
Everything is a version of something else.

698
01:02:52,584 --> 01:02:54,211
Twenty years ago.

699
01:02:54,586 --> 01:02:55,951
How old were you?

700
01:02:56,054 --> 01:02:57,885
- Four.
- Christ.

701
01:02:58,090 --> 01:03:02,186
- When I was in flares, you were in nappies.
- My nappies were flared.

702
01:03:02,261 --> 01:03:04,855
- You have the face of an angel.
- Thank you.

703
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:07,160
What does your cunt taste like?

704
01:03:07,466 --> 01:03:08,797
Heaven.

705
01:03:12,905 --> 01:03:14,463
How long have you been doing this?

706
01:03:14,539 --> 01:03:17,235
- Three months.
- Straight after he left you?

707
01:03:17,776 --> 01:03:19,505
No one left me.

708
01:03:21,246 --> 01:03:23,544
- Nice wig.
- Thank you.

709
01:03:24,483 --> 01:03:26,542
Does all this turn you on?

710
01:03:26,652 --> 01:03:27,949
- Sometimes.
- Liar.

711
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:31,046
You're telling me that
'cause you think it's what I want to hear.

712
01:03:31,123 --> 01:03:33,023
You think I'm turned on
by it turning you on.

713
01:03:33,091 --> 01:03:37,391
The thought of me creaming myself when
I strip for strangers doesn't turn you on?

714
01:03:37,462 --> 01:03:39,453
Put like that, yes.

715
01:03:42,734 --> 01:03:45,362
- Are you flirting with me?
- Maybe.

716
01:03:46,371 --> 01:03:48,532
- Are you allowed to flirt with me?
- Sure.

717
01:03:48,607 --> 01:03:51,167
- Really?
- No, I'm not. I'm breaking all the rules.

718
01:03:51,243 --> 01:03:53,837
- You're mocking me.
- Yes, I'm allowed to flirt.

719
01:03:53,912 --> 01:03:55,209
To prize my money from me.

720
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,443
To prize your money from you,
I may do or say as I please.

721
01:03:58,517 --> 01:04:00,382
- Except touch.
- We're not allowed to touch.

722
01:04:00,452 --> 01:04:01,783
Open your legs.

723
01:04:02,554 --> 01:04:03,782
Wider.

724
01:04:14,199 --> 01:04:15,530
Show me.

725
01:04:20,872 --> 01:04:22,999
So what would happen
if I touched you now?

726
01:04:23,075 --> 01:04:25,236
- I'd call security.
- What would they do?

727
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:27,835
They would ask you to leave
and not to come back.

728
01:04:27,913 --> 01:04:30,381
- And if I refused to leave?
- They would remove you.

729
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:33,179
Those are security cameras in the ceiling.

730
01:04:36,488 --> 01:04:39,218
I think it's best I don't attempt to touch you.

731
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:42,689
I'd like to touch you. Later.

732
01:04:42,828 --> 01:04:45,228
- I'm not a whore.
- I wouldn't pay.

733
01:04:46,999 --> 01:04:49,263
Why the fuck did he leave you?

734
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:52,164
- What's your job?
- A question. You asked me a question.

735
01:04:52,237 --> 01:04:53,966
- So?
- It's a chink in your armor.

736
01:04:54,039 --> 01:04:56,473
- I'm not wearing armor.
- Yes, you are.

737
01:04:56,541 --> 01:04:59,374
- Why are you calling yourself Jane?
- Because it's my name.

738
01:04:59,444 --> 01:05:01,309
We both know it isn't.

739
01:05:02,614 --> 01:05:04,582
You're all protecting your identities.

740
01:05:04,649 --> 01:05:08,312
There's a girl out there who calls
herself Venus. What's her real name?

741
01:05:08,387 --> 01:05:10,855
- Pluto.
- You're cheeky.

742
01:05:10,956 --> 01:05:13,857
- Would you like me to stop being cheeky?
- No.

743
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,284
What's your name?

744
01:05:17,763 --> 01:05:18,889
Daniel.

745
01:05:20,198 --> 01:05:21,859
Daniel the dermatologist.

746
01:05:21,933 --> 01:05:24,265
- I never told you my job.
- I guessed.

747
01:05:24,603 --> 01:05:26,161
You're strong.

748
01:05:26,738 --> 01:05:30,333
There's another one out there.
Judging by the scars, a patient of Dr. Tit.

749
01:05:30,409 --> 01:05:33,105
Calls herself Cupid.
Who's gonna tell her he was a bloke?

750
01:05:33,178 --> 01:05:37,444
- He wasn't a bloke. He was a little boy.
- I want you to tell me your name.

751
01:05:42,754 --> 01:05:43,982
Please.

752
01:05:45,290 --> 01:05:48,088
Thank you. My name is Jane.

753
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:50,225
Your real name.

754
01:05:51,930 --> 01:05:53,261
Thank you.

755
01:05:53,932 --> 01:05:56,662
- My real name is Jane.
- Careful.

756
01:06:00,338 --> 01:06:03,000
Thank you. Still Jane.

757
01:06:03,208 --> 01:06:05,267
I've got about another £500 here.

758
01:06:05,343 --> 01:06:10,280
Why don't I just give you all this money
and you tell me what your real name is...

759
01:06:11,116 --> 01:06:12,310
Alice?

760
01:06:13,018 --> 01:06:14,485
I promise.

761
01:06:15,921 --> 01:06:17,252
Thank you.

762
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:20,082
My real name...

763
01:06:20,258 --> 01:06:22,954
is plain Jane Jones.

764
01:06:23,028 --> 01:06:24,825
I may be rich, but I'm not stupid.

765
01:06:24,896 --> 01:06:27,160
What a shame, Doc.
I love them rich and stupid.

766
01:06:27,232 --> 01:06:29,393
Don't you fuck around with me.

767
01:06:29,468 --> 01:06:32,028
- I apologize.
- Accepted.

768
01:06:32,604 --> 01:06:36,040
All the girls in this hellhole,
the pneumatic robots...

769
01:06:36,108 --> 01:06:38,599
the coked-up baby dolls,
and you're no different.

770
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:41,770
You all use stage names
to con yourselves you're someone else...

771
01:06:41,847 --> 01:06:45,305
so you don't feel ashamed showing
your cunts and assholes to strangers.

772
01:06:45,383 --> 01:06:46,850
I'm trying to have a conversation.

773
01:06:46,918 --> 01:06:48,783
- You're out of cash.
- I paid for this room.

774
01:06:48,854 --> 01:06:49,912
This is extra.

775
01:06:49,988 --> 01:06:51,546
- We met last year.
- Wrong girl.

776
01:06:51,623 --> 01:06:52,954
Talk to me!

777
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:56,152
- I am.
- Talk to me in real life.

778
01:06:56,328 --> 01:06:59,764
I didn't know you'd be here.
I know who you are.

779
01:07:01,032 --> 01:07:02,431
I love you.

780
01:07:03,935 --> 01:07:06,460
I love everything about you that hurts.

781
01:07:19,451 --> 01:07:21,419
She won't even see me.

782
01:07:22,754 --> 01:07:26,520
- You feel the same. I know it.
- You can't cry in here.

783
01:07:27,425 --> 01:07:30,861
- Hold me. Let me hold you.
- We're not allowed to touch.

784
01:07:31,963 --> 01:07:34,796
Come home with me. It's safe.
Let me look after you.

785
01:07:34,866 --> 01:07:37,596
- I don't need looking after.
- Everyone needs looking after.

786
01:07:37,669 --> 01:07:39,637
I'm not your revenge fuck.

787
01:07:40,672 --> 01:07:42,401
- I'll pay you.
- I don't need your money.

788
01:07:42,474 --> 01:07:43,736
- You have my money.
- Thank you.

789
01:07:43,808 --> 01:07:47,335
- "Thank you." Is that some kind of rule?
- Just being polite.

790
01:07:50,248 --> 01:07:53,081
Do you get a lot of grown men
crying their guts out here?

791
01:07:53,151 --> 01:07:55,119
Occupational hazard.

792
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:57,654
Have you ever desired a customer?

793
01:07:59,090 --> 01:08:00,352
Yes.

794
01:08:00,425 --> 01:08:02,620
Then put me out of my misery.
Do you desire me?

795
01:08:02,694 --> 01:08:05,288
Because I'm being pretty honest
about my feelings for you.

796
01:08:05,363 --> 01:08:07,593
- Your feelings?
- Whatever.

797
01:08:07,933 --> 01:08:09,833
No, I don't desire you.

798
01:08:11,102 --> 01:08:12,467
Thank you.

799
01:08:13,405 --> 01:08:16,169
Thank you sincerely for your honesty.

800
01:08:24,249 --> 01:08:26,809
You think you haven't give us
anything of yourselves?

801
01:08:26,885 --> 01:08:29,615
Do you think because you don't love us
or desire us...

802
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:32,282
or even like us, you think you've won?

803
01:08:32,357 --> 01:08:33,847
It's not a war.

804
01:08:40,098 --> 01:08:42,396
If I asked you to strip right now, would you?

805
01:08:42,467 --> 01:08:45,129
- Of course. Do you want me to?
- No.

806
01:08:46,771 --> 01:08:49,831
Alice, tell me something true.

807
01:08:50,775 --> 01:08:54,871
Lying is the most fun a girl can have
without taking her clothes off...

808
01:08:55,447 --> 01:08:57,608
but it's better if you do.

809
01:08:59,384 --> 01:09:00,783
You're cold.

810
01:09:01,419 --> 01:09:03,444
You're all cold at heart.

811
01:09:05,257 --> 01:09:08,317
What do you have to do
to get a bit of intimacy around here?

812
01:09:08,393 --> 01:09:11,453
Maybe next time
I'll have worked on my intimacy.

813
01:09:11,863 --> 01:09:16,027
No, I'll tell you what's gonna work.
You're gonna take your gear off right now.

814
01:09:16,101 --> 01:09:20,561
You're gonna turn around very slowly,
and you're gonna bend over...

815
01:09:21,139 --> 01:09:25,405
and you're gonna touch the fucking floor
for my viewing pleasure.

816
01:09:26,278 --> 01:09:28,212
Is that what you want?

817
01:09:29,614 --> 01:09:31,514
What else could I want?

818
01:10:38,583 --> 01:10:39,914
I'm sorry.

819
01:10:42,253 --> 01:10:44,244
- What happened?
- Traffic.

820
01:10:46,358 --> 01:10:49,725
- Do you want to go stand in the back?
- No, let's have a drink.

821
01:10:53,698 --> 01:10:55,495
You look flushed.

822
01:10:56,601 --> 01:10:58,569
You have no need to run.

823
01:10:58,636 --> 01:11:00,160
- Vodka tonic?
- Yes.

824
01:11:00,238 --> 01:11:03,435
- Vodka tonic and a Guinness, please.
- Sure.

825
01:11:04,676 --> 01:11:06,109
How was it?

826
01:11:07,312 --> 01:11:08,472
Fine.

827
01:11:09,047 --> 01:11:10,514
You had lunch?

828
01:11:11,216 --> 01:11:12,513
Then what?

829
01:11:14,285 --> 01:11:16,776
- And then we left.
- And?

830
01:11:17,655 --> 01:11:19,247
There's no "and."

831
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:25,457
You haven't seen him in four months.
There must be an "and."

832
01:11:25,764 --> 01:11:28,198
- How is he?
- Terrible.

833
01:11:36,941 --> 01:11:39,205
- Keep the change.
- Thank you, sir.

834
01:11:43,281 --> 01:11:45,272
How is his dermatology?

835
01:11:45,483 --> 01:11:49,249
- He's in private practice now.
- Is he?

836
01:11:51,823 --> 01:11:54,223
Was he weeping all over the place?

837
01:11:54,325 --> 01:11:57,556
- Some of the time.
- Poor bastard.

838
01:11:58,229 --> 01:12:00,789
Was he difficult?

839
01:12:03,334 --> 01:12:05,495
Are you angry that I saw him?

840
01:12:05,637 --> 01:12:07,298
No. It's just...

841
01:12:08,673 --> 01:12:10,265
I haven't seen Alice.

842
01:12:10,341 --> 01:12:12,969
You can't see Alice.
You don't know where she is.

843
01:12:13,044 --> 01:12:15,171
I haven't tried to find her.

844
01:12:16,581 --> 01:12:17,946
You know why I saw him.

845
01:12:18,016 --> 01:12:20,780
He's been begging me for months.
I saw him so he'd sign.

846
01:12:20,852 --> 01:12:23,082
- So has he signed?
- Yes.

847
01:12:27,525 --> 01:12:29,083
Congratulations.

848
01:12:29,961 --> 01:12:31,792
You're a divorcée.

849
01:12:33,298 --> 01:12:35,027
Double divorcée.

850
01:12:37,035 --> 01:12:38,332
Sorry.

851
01:12:39,370 --> 01:12:40,894
How do you feel?

852
01:12:42,106 --> 01:12:43,266
Tired.

853
01:12:47,445 --> 01:12:48,810
I love you.

854
01:12:49,547 --> 01:12:51,276
And I need a piss.

855
01:13:28,219 --> 01:13:29,743
I hate this place.

856
01:13:30,788 --> 01:13:32,187
At least it's central.

857
01:13:32,257 --> 01:13:35,317
I hate central.
Central London's a theme park.

858
01:13:36,294 --> 01:13:40,628
I hate retro. I hate the future.
Where does that leave me?

859
01:13:41,733 --> 01:13:43,030
Come back.

860
01:13:43,801 --> 01:13:46,634
- You promised you wouldn't.
- Come back.

861
01:13:50,975 --> 01:13:54,035
- How's work?
- Jesus. Work's shit, okay?

862
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:06,588
Do they have waiters here?
I love you. Please come back.

863
01:14:07,492 --> 01:14:09,221
I'm not coming back.

864
01:14:15,133 --> 01:14:16,225
Sign.

865
01:14:17,435 --> 01:14:18,697
No pen.

866
01:14:24,208 --> 01:14:25,266
Pen.

867
01:14:28,279 --> 01:14:30,076
Give me back my hand.

868
01:14:39,691 --> 01:14:40,783
Sign.

869
01:14:47,365 --> 01:14:49,458
I'll sign on one condition.

870
01:14:51,302 --> 01:14:54,533
We skip this.
We go to my sleek new surgery...

871
01:14:54,606 --> 01:14:57,769
and we christen the patients' bed
with our final fuck.

872
01:14:57,842 --> 01:14:59,742
I know you don't want to...

873
01:15:00,178 --> 01:15:04,205
and I know you think I'm sick for asking,
but that's what I'm asking.

874
01:15:04,282 --> 01:15:05,977
For old times' sake.

875
01:15:06,784 --> 01:15:08,911
Because I'm obsessed with you.

876
01:15:09,621 --> 01:15:12,317
Because I can't get over you unless...

877
01:15:13,124 --> 01:15:14,955
Because I think, on some small level...

878
01:15:15,026 --> 01:15:18,325
you owe me something
for deceiving me so exquisitely.

879
01:15:19,263 --> 01:15:23,632
For all these reasons,
I am begging you to give me your body.

880
01:15:25,536 --> 01:15:27,299
You'd be my whore.

881
01:15:27,839 --> 01:15:30,706
And in return,
I will pay you with your liberty.

882
01:15:32,644 --> 01:15:35,943
You do this,
I swear I will not contact you again.

883
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:42,950
I'm going to the bar.

884
01:15:43,588 --> 01:15:46,079
I assume you still drink vodka tonic?

885
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:10,674
You slept with him, didn't you?

886
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:39,973
- What do you expect me to do?
- Understand.

887
01:16:41,245 --> 01:16:42,712
Why didn't you lie to me?

888
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:45,374
Because we said
we'd always tell each other the truth.

889
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:47,042
What's so great about the truth?

890
01:16:47,118 --> 01:16:50,417
Try lying for a change.
It's the currency of the world.

891
01:16:52,623 --> 01:16:57,322
I did what he wanted,
and now he will leave us alone.

892
01:17:00,398 --> 01:17:01,763
I love you.

893
01:17:02,967 --> 01:17:05,834
- I didn't give him anything.
- Your body?

894
01:17:07,638 --> 01:17:11,130
If Alice came to you, desperate...

895
01:17:11,609 --> 01:17:13,702
with all that love still between you...

896
01:17:13,778 --> 01:17:15,837
and she said she needed you to want her...

897
01:17:15,913 --> 01:17:18,006
so she could get over you, you'd do it.

898
01:17:18,082 --> 01:17:21,074
I wouldn't like it either, but I'd forgive you.

899
01:17:21,385 --> 01:17:24,513
- It's kindness.
- No, cowardice.

900
01:17:24,722 --> 01:17:26,917
You haven't got the guts to let him hate you.

901
01:17:39,003 --> 01:17:42,734
I'm doing this because I feel guilty,
and because I pity you.

902
01:17:42,807 --> 01:17:45,708
- You know that, don't you?
- Yes.

903
01:17:46,544 --> 01:17:49,411
- Feel good about yourself?
- No.

904
01:17:59,791 --> 01:18:01,156
It's gone.

905
01:18:02,193 --> 01:18:06,323
- We're not innocent anymore.
- Don't stop loving me.

906
01:18:06,397 --> 01:18:09,889
I can see it draining out of you.
It's me, remember?

907
01:18:10,668 --> 01:18:13,762
It was a stupid thing to do,
and it meant nothing.

908
01:18:14,172 --> 01:18:16,436
If you love me enough, you'll forgive me.

909
01:18:16,507 --> 01:18:18,907
- Are you testing me?
- No.

910
01:18:19,510 --> 01:18:23,412
- I do understand.
- No. He understands.

911
01:18:25,683 --> 01:18:28,846
All I can see is him all over you.

912
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:32,921
He's clever, your ex-husband.

913
01:18:34,425 --> 01:18:35,949
I almost admire him.

914
01:18:39,897 --> 01:18:41,888
You going to tell him?

915
01:18:43,501 --> 01:18:44,991
I don't know.

916
01:18:57,248 --> 01:19:00,376
Better to be truthful about this kind of thing.

917
01:19:07,692 --> 01:19:08,886
Sign.

918
01:19:17,468 --> 01:19:18,958
I forgive you.

919
01:19:22,406 --> 01:19:23,737
Sign.

920
01:19:27,545 --> 01:19:29,445
I think you enjoyed it.

921
01:19:30,481 --> 01:19:34,008
He wheedles you into bed. The old jokes...

922
01:19:34,085 --> 01:19:38,044
the strange familiarity.
I think you had a whale of a time.

923
01:19:38,122 --> 01:19:40,454
And the truth is I'll never know
unless I ask him.

924
01:19:40,524 --> 01:19:42,048
Why don't you?

925
01:20:30,608 --> 01:20:31,700
Yes?

926
01:20:33,377 --> 01:20:35,174
You can go in now.

927
01:20:42,787 --> 01:20:45,688
- I want Anna back.
- She's made her choice.

928
01:20:45,756 --> 01:20:50,352
I owe you an apology. I fell in love with her.
My intention was not to make you suffer.

929
01:20:50,428 --> 01:20:53,488
So where's the apology? You cunt.

930
01:20:54,398 --> 01:20:57,424
I apologize.
If you love her, you'll let her go...

931
01:20:57,501 --> 01:20:59,128
so she can be happy.

932
01:20:59,203 --> 01:21:02,001
- She doesn't want to be happy.
- Everybody wants to be happy.

933
01:21:02,073 --> 01:21:05,474
Depressives don't. They want to be unhappy
to confirm they're depressed.

934
01:21:05,543 --> 01:21:07,738
If they were happy,
they couldn't be depressed.

935
01:21:07,812 --> 01:21:11,270
They'd have to go out into the world
and live, which can be depressing.

936
01:21:11,349 --> 01:21:13,817
- Anna's not a depressive.
- Isn't she?

937
01:21:13,884 --> 01:21:16,944
- I love her.
- Boo-hoo. So do I.

938
01:21:17,355 --> 01:21:20,153
She's gone back to you
because she can't bear your suffering.

939
01:21:20,224 --> 01:21:21,953
You don't know who she is.

940
01:21:22,026 --> 01:21:26,622
- You love her like a dog loves its owner.
- And the owner loves the dog for so doing.

941
01:21:26,697 --> 01:21:28,722
You'll hurt her. You'll never forgive her.

942
01:21:28,799 --> 01:21:30,892
Of course I forgive her. I have forgiven her.

943
01:21:30,968 --> 01:21:34,233
Without forgiveness we're savages.
You're drowning.

944
01:21:34,305 --> 01:21:37,399
- You only met her because of me.
- Yeah. Thanks.

945
01:21:37,475 --> 01:21:39,636
It's a joke. Your marriage is a joke.

946
01:21:39,710 --> 01:21:43,202
Here's a good one. She never sent
the divorce papers to her lawyer.

947
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:48,183
Now, to a towering romantic hero like you,
I don't doubt I am somewhat common.

948
01:21:48,252 --> 01:21:50,550
But I am, nevertheless,
what she has chosen...

949
01:21:50,621 --> 01:21:53,385
and we must respect what the woman wants.

950
01:21:54,492 --> 01:21:57,859
If you go near her again, I swear...

951
01:21:58,829 --> 01:22:00,558
I will kill you.

952
01:22:04,902 --> 01:22:08,030
Okay. I have patients to see.

953
01:22:08,105 --> 01:22:10,300
When she came here,
do you think she enjoyed it?

954
01:22:10,374 --> 01:22:13,002
I didn't do it to give her a nice time.

955
01:22:13,077 --> 01:22:15,238
I fucked her to fuck you up.

956
01:22:15,746 --> 01:22:19,341
A good fight is never clean.
And of course she enjoyed it.

957
01:22:19,417 --> 01:22:22,011
As you know, she loves a guilty fuck.

958
01:22:22,086 --> 01:22:24,748
- You're an animal.
- Yeah? What are you?

959
01:22:24,822 --> 01:22:27,916
You think love is simple.
You think the heart is like a diagram.

960
01:22:27,992 --> 01:22:31,621
Have you ever seen a human heart?
It looks like a fist wrapped in blood!

961
01:22:31,695 --> 01:22:34,721
Go fuck yourself. You writer!

962
01:22:35,132 --> 01:22:36,497
You liar!

963
01:22:36,567 --> 01:22:39,001
You go check a few facts
while I get my hands dirty.

964
01:22:39,070 --> 01:22:41,664
She hates your hands.
She hates your simplicity.

965
01:22:41,739 --> 01:22:44,105
I spent the whole of last week
talking about you.

966
01:22:44,175 --> 01:22:47,576
I know all your ways. Anna says
you fucked her with your eyes closed.

967
01:22:47,645 --> 01:22:51,877
She tells me you wake in the night
crying for your mother, you mommy's boy.

968
01:22:51,949 --> 01:22:53,473
I could go on.

969
01:22:55,619 --> 01:22:57,314
Shall we stop this?

970
01:23:02,993 --> 01:23:05,985
It's over. Accept it.

971
01:23:11,068 --> 01:23:14,037
You don't know the first thing about love...

972
01:23:14,472 --> 01:23:17,100
because you don't understand compromise.

973
01:23:25,816 --> 01:23:28,580
- Don't cry on me.
- I'm sorry.

974
01:23:31,422 --> 01:23:33,447
I don't know what to do.

975
01:23:34,125 --> 01:23:37,288
You want my advice? You go back to Alice.

976
01:23:40,331 --> 01:23:42,060
She'd never have me.

977
01:23:43,901 --> 01:23:46,495
- She's vanished.
- No, she hasn't.

978
01:23:46,770 --> 01:23:48,738
I found her, by accident.

979
01:23:49,206 --> 01:23:51,401
She's working in a club.

980
01:23:52,576 --> 01:23:54,908
Yes, I saw her naked.

981
01:23:55,746 --> 01:23:57,737
No, I did not fuck her.

982
01:23:58,716 --> 01:24:00,377
You spoke to her?

983
01:24:05,222 --> 01:24:07,452
Yes, I know. One minute.

984
01:24:08,926 --> 01:24:10,393
How is she?

985
01:24:10,895 --> 01:24:12,556
She loves you...

986
01:24:13,264 --> 01:24:15,289
beyond comprehension.

987
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,329
Your prescription.

988
01:24:19,503 --> 01:24:21,368
It's where she works.

989
01:24:23,908 --> 01:24:25,307
Go to her.

990
01:24:26,677 --> 01:24:28,008
Thank you.

991
01:24:31,782 --> 01:24:34,273
You still pissing about on the Net?

992
01:24:35,586 --> 01:24:37,053
Not recently.

993
01:24:37,488 --> 01:24:40,980
- I wanted to kill you.
- I thought you wanted to fuck me.

994
01:24:41,225 --> 01:24:42,817
Don't get lippy.

995
01:24:44,728 --> 01:24:46,958
I liked your book, by the way.

996
01:24:47,231 --> 01:24:50,325
Thanks. You stand alone.

997
01:24:50,534 --> 01:24:52,024
With Anna.

998
01:24:53,237 --> 01:24:58,004
- You still writing obituaries? Busy?
- I was made editor.

999
01:24:58,242 --> 01:25:01,177
- Yeah? How come?
- Previous editor died.

1000
01:25:04,815 --> 01:25:08,717
Alcohol poisoning.
I sat with him for a week in the hospital.

1001
01:25:11,021 --> 01:25:13,455
I really do have patients to see.

1002
01:25:15,526 --> 01:25:18,017
- Thank you.
- For what?

1003
01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:21,798
- Being kind.
- I am kind.

1004
01:25:22,266 --> 01:25:24,393
Your invoice is in the post.

1005
01:25:38,215 --> 01:25:39,682
I lied to you.

1006
01:25:41,085 --> 01:25:42,746
I did fuck Alice.

1007
01:25:45,422 --> 01:25:49,381
Sorry for telling you.
I'm just not big enough to forgive you.

1008
01:25:51,795 --> 01:25:53,126
Buster.

1009
01:26:24,161 --> 01:26:25,958
Show me the sneer.

1010
01:26:28,999 --> 01:26:30,626
Beautiful.

1011
01:26:30,701 --> 01:26:32,532
You'll wake up the hotel.

1012
01:26:39,209 --> 01:26:40,608
Fuck me.

1013
01:26:41,845 --> 01:26:44,143
Again? We have to get up at 6:00.

1014
01:26:44,214 --> 01:26:47,581
How can one man
be so endlessly disappointing?

1015
01:26:47,651 --> 01:26:49,118
That's my charm.

1016
01:26:50,321 --> 01:26:53,017
So where are we going?

1017
01:26:53,757 --> 01:26:55,190
- My treat.
- Where are we going?

1018
01:26:55,259 --> 01:26:57,853
My holiday surprise. My rules.

1019
01:26:58,062 --> 01:27:00,223
Where are we going?

1020
01:27:01,498 --> 01:27:03,898
New York.

1021
01:27:06,103 --> 01:27:07,661
You angel.

1022
01:27:09,373 --> 01:27:13,275
- You did remember to pack my passport?
- Of course. It's with my passport.

1023
01:27:13,344 --> 01:27:14,606
And where's that?

1024
01:27:14,678 --> 01:27:18,637
In a place where you can't look.
No one sees my passport picture.

1025
01:27:23,754 --> 01:27:27,554
When we get on the plane,
we'll have been together four years.

1026
01:27:28,325 --> 01:27:29,883
What about the gap?

1027
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:33,157
You mean trial separation? Didn't work out.

1028
01:27:33,497 --> 01:27:35,192
Happy anniversary.

1029
01:27:40,738 --> 01:27:42,899
I'm going to take my eyes out.

1030
01:27:45,743 --> 01:27:48,268
- What was in my sandwiches?
- Tuna.

1031
01:27:49,179 --> 01:27:52,114
- How many stitches did I get?
- Two.

1032
01:27:52,182 --> 01:27:54,275
But you should have had three.

1033
01:27:55,586 --> 01:27:58,350
- What was your euphemism?
- Disarming.

1034
01:27:58,822 --> 01:28:01,382
Too easy, buster. Next?

1035
01:28:01,825 --> 01:28:04,726
That park. Who'd I go there with?

1036
01:28:06,163 --> 01:28:07,687
Your father.

1037
01:28:08,899 --> 01:28:11,834
Were the chairs in the hospital gray or blue?

1038
01:28:12,469 --> 01:28:14,937
- No idea.
- Trick question. They were green.

1039
01:28:15,005 --> 01:28:17,303
You are a trick question.

1040
01:28:23,447 --> 01:28:25,915
How come we never took a vacation?

1041
01:28:26,683 --> 01:28:28,150
We went to the country.

1042
01:28:28,218 --> 01:28:32,177
Doesn't count. You were off
making sneaky phone calls...

1043
01:28:32,523 --> 01:28:34,821
to that witch we do not mention.

1044
01:28:39,963 --> 01:28:41,328
Come to bed.

1045
01:28:41,398 --> 01:28:42,922
I need a smoke.

1046
01:28:45,269 --> 01:28:48,568
- How'd you manage to give up?
- Deep inner strength.

1047
01:28:59,249 --> 01:29:00,580
Why me?

1048
01:29:02,152 --> 01:29:04,848
You could have chosen anyone. Why me?

1049
01:29:05,989 --> 01:29:08,184
Because you cut off your crusts.

1050
01:29:11,495 --> 01:29:12,757
And this.

1051
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:19,292
- When are you going to stop stripping?
- Soon.

1052
01:29:19,603 --> 01:29:22,333
- You're addicted to it.
- No, I'm not.

1053
01:29:22,406 --> 01:29:24,067
It paid for this.

1054
01:29:26,276 --> 01:29:28,073
Tell me what happened.

1055
01:29:29,713 --> 01:29:33,114
- Nothing happened.
- But he came to the club.

1056
01:29:33,684 --> 01:29:36,778
Lots of men come to the club.
You came to the club.

1057
01:29:50,534 --> 01:29:53,662
- The look on your face.
- The look on your face.

1058
01:29:55,405 --> 01:29:57,965
What a face. What a wig.

1059
01:30:03,714 --> 01:30:05,841
I saw this face...

1060
01:30:07,751 --> 01:30:10,083
this vision...

1061
01:30:10,988 --> 01:30:14,890
when you stepped into the road.
It was the moment of my life.

1062
01:30:16,326 --> 01:30:19,591
- This is the moment of your life.
- You were perfect.

1063
01:30:19,897 --> 01:30:21,387
I still am.

1064
01:30:22,599 --> 01:30:24,567
On the way to the hospital...

1065
01:30:24,902 --> 01:30:26,767
I kissed your forehead.

1066
01:30:27,337 --> 01:30:28,634
You brute.

1067
01:30:28,705 --> 01:30:31,765
The cabbie saw me kissing you.
He said, "Is she yours?"

1068
01:30:31,842 --> 01:30:33,833
I said, "Yes, she's mine."

1069
01:30:35,679 --> 01:30:37,169
She's mine.

1070
01:30:45,222 --> 01:30:50,125
So he came to the club, watched you strip,
you had a little chat, and that was it?

1071
01:30:52,429 --> 01:30:53,589
Yes.

1072
01:30:58,268 --> 01:31:00,133
You're not trusting me.

1073
01:31:00,971 --> 01:31:03,667
I'm in love with you. You're safe.

1074
01:31:04,541 --> 01:31:06,907
You had every right. I just want to know.

1075
01:31:06,977 --> 01:31:09,741
- Why?
- Because I want to know everything.

1076
01:31:11,248 --> 01:31:13,079
Because I'm a lunatic.

1077
01:31:14,651 --> 01:31:15,913
Tell me.

1078
01:31:18,055 --> 01:31:19,886
Nothing happened.

1079
01:31:21,358 --> 01:31:24,327
- You were living with someone else.
- What are you justifying?

1080
01:31:24,394 --> 01:31:26,225
I'm not justifying anything. Just saying.

1081
01:31:26,296 --> 01:31:28,423
- What are you saying?
- I'm not saying anything.

1082
01:31:28,498 --> 01:31:30,398
I just want the truth.

1083
01:31:31,768 --> 01:31:34,362
- Where are you going?
- Cigarettes.

1084
01:31:35,872 --> 01:31:37,237
Everywhere's closed.

1085
01:31:37,307 --> 01:31:39,969
I'll go to the terminal.

1086
01:31:40,777 --> 01:31:42,506
When I get back...

1087
01:31:42,713 --> 01:31:44,681
please tell me the truth.

1088
01:31:46,883 --> 01:31:49,818
- Why?
- Because I'm addicted to it.

1089
01:31:50,253 --> 01:31:53,916
Because without it we're animals.

1090
01:31:55,258 --> 01:31:56,623
Trust me.

1091
01:33:03,193 --> 01:33:05,218
I don't love you anymore.

1092
01:33:06,029 --> 01:33:07,326
Since when?

1093
01:33:07,397 --> 01:33:08,557
Now.

1094
01:33:09,366 --> 01:33:10,663
Just now.

1095
01:33:11,735 --> 01:33:13,635
I don't want to lie...

1096
01:33:14,304 --> 01:33:16,636
and I can't tell the truth...

1097
01:33:17,074 --> 01:33:18,507
so it's over.

1098
01:33:18,975 --> 01:33:20,636
It doesn't matter.

1099
01:33:20,877 --> 01:33:24,677
- I love you. None of it matters.
- Too late.

1100
01:33:27,150 --> 01:33:29,175
I don't love you anymore.

1101
01:33:30,754 --> 01:33:31,982
Goodbye.

1102
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:38,991
Here's the truth...

1103
01:33:39,863 --> 01:33:41,922
so now you can hate me.

1104
01:33:44,334 --> 01:33:46,666
Larry fucked me all night.

1105
01:33:48,171 --> 01:33:49,798
I enjoyed it.

1106
01:33:50,841 --> 01:33:52,138
I came.

1107
01:33:55,512 --> 01:33:57,002
I prefer you.

1108
01:33:59,516 --> 01:34:00,813
Now go.

1109
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:05,119
I knew that.

1110
01:34:06,056 --> 01:34:07,546
He told me.

1111
01:34:08,291 --> 01:34:11,283
- You knew?
- I needed to hear it from you.

1112
01:34:11,728 --> 01:34:14,526
- Why?
- Because he might have been lying.

1113
01:34:14,865 --> 01:34:16,264
I had to hear it from you.

1114
01:34:16,333 --> 01:34:19,496
I would never have told you,
because I know you'd never forgive me.

1115
01:34:19,569 --> 01:34:21,196
I would. I have.

1116
01:34:22,038 --> 01:34:24,529
- Why did he tell you?
- Because he's a bastard.

1117
01:34:24,608 --> 01:34:27,008
- How could he?
- Because he wanted this to happen.

1118
01:34:27,077 --> 01:34:29,739
- But why test me?
- Because I'm an idiot.

1119
01:34:29,813 --> 01:34:30,939
Yes.

1120
01:34:31,915 --> 01:34:33,906
I would have loved you...

1121
01:34:34,918 --> 01:34:36,317
forever.

1122
01:34:38,155 --> 01:34:40,783
- Now please go.
- Don't do this. Talk to me.

1123
01:34:40,857 --> 01:34:42,757
I am talking. Fuck off.

1124
01:34:42,826 --> 01:34:45,317
No, I'm sorry. You misunderstand.
I didn't mean to...

1125
01:34:45,395 --> 01:34:46,384
Yes, you did.

1126
01:34:46,463 --> 01:34:47,987
- I love you.
- Where?

1127
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:49,793
- What?
- Show me.

1128
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:52,195
Where is this love?

1129
01:34:53,003 --> 01:34:57,406
I can't see it. I can't touch it. I can't feel it.

1130
01:34:58,308 --> 01:35:01,402
I can hear it. I can hear some words...

1131
01:35:01,478 --> 01:35:04,470
but I can't do anything
with your easy words.

1132
01:35:04,981 --> 01:35:07,415
Whatever you say, it's too late.

1133
01:35:07,484 --> 01:35:10,544
- Please don't do this.
- It's done.

1134
01:35:11,388 --> 01:35:15,154
Now please go, or I'll call security.

1135
01:35:15,659 --> 01:35:18,389
You're not in a strip club.
There is no security.

1136
01:35:21,898 --> 01:35:23,661
- Why did you fuck him?
- I wanted to.

1137
01:35:23,733 --> 01:35:25,223
- Why?
- I desired him.

1138
01:35:25,302 --> 01:35:27,293
- Why?
- You weren't there.

1139
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:30,098
- Why him?
- He asked me nicely.

1140
01:35:30,173 --> 01:35:31,470
- You're a liar.
- So?

1141
01:35:31,541 --> 01:35:33,975
- Who are you?
- I'm no one.

1142
01:35:36,713 --> 01:35:40,046
Go on, hit me. That's what you want.
Hit me, fucker.

1143
01:37:01,264 --> 01:37:03,858
- Welcome back, Miss Jones.
- Thank you.
