00:19:03,136 --> 00:19:04,603
DAVID: She couldn't have died
at a worst time either, too.

363
00:19:04,637 --> 00:19:05,705
It's harvest.

364
00:19:08,007 --> 00:19:09,008
What?

365
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:11,443
Nothin'.

366
00:19:11,878 --> 00:19:12,945
Should we go find Em?

367
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,847
No, she can wait.

368
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,016
I wanna show you somethin'.

369
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:17,784
Come on.

370
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:19,618
Okay.

371
00:19:29,996 --> 00:19:30,997
[Sighing]

372
00:19:32,765 --> 00:19:34,566
This is my safe place.

373
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:37,770
What?

374
00:19:38,204 --> 00:19:40,873
It's just the 13th century
looks really good on you.

375
00:19:43,643 --> 00:19:48,848
So is this this year's um,
vintage?

376
00:19:48,881 --> 00:19:50,817
DAVID: No,
this year's is still on the vine.

377
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,787
And most of last year is
in a larger cellar

378
00:19:54,821 --> 00:19:56,555
by the winery.

379
00:19:56,588 --> 00:19:58,991
This is the family cellar.

380
00:19:59,025 --> 00:20:00,927
Hmm.

381
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,629
[Sighs]

382
00:20:03,663 --> 00:20:05,597
Tell me something
you've never told anybody.

383
00:20:05,631 --> 00:20:06,666
What? Why?

384
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:08,968
Because I'm about
to show you a secret

385
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:10,602
and I need assurances.

386
00:20:10,636 --> 00:20:12,672
Come on!
What are we, 10?

387
00:20:12,939 --> 00:20:14,106
Just tell me something.

388
00:20:14,774 --> 00:20:16,441
Oh, fine.

389
00:20:16,474 --> 00:20:17,844
Um...

390
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,013
[Sighing]

391
00:20:22,982 --> 00:20:24,116
I had an abortion.

392
00:20:25,617 --> 00:20:26,986
Oh.

393
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:28,654
I had an abortion.

394
00:20:28,688 --> 00:20:29,755
TOM:
Yeah, a few years ago.

395
00:20:32,091 --> 00:20:33,625
Well, don't look at me like
that.

396
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:34,827
It's not a big deal.

397
00:20:34,861 --> 00:20:36,829
No, I mean, I know.
I know it's not.

398
00:20:36,863 --> 00:20:38,931
It's... it's not
if it's not for you.

399
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:40,498
It's not.

400
00:20:42,802 --> 00:20:43,836
Okay.

401
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:47,572
Okay, so what's your secret?

402
00:20:47,606 --> 00:20:49,642
[Chuckles]

403
00:20:49,675 --> 00:20:50,743
Fine, okay.

404
00:20:53,578 --> 00:20:55,882
[Grunting]

405
00:21:11,463 --> 00:21:12,798
Wait, how is that a secret?

406
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,135
Well, it's electricity
on the vineyard.

407
00:21:17,003 --> 00:21:21,107
So I told you
that I had an abortion

408
00:21:21,974 --> 00:21:24,010
and you're showing me
a record player.

409
00:21:25,778 --> 00:21:26,779
Oh.

410
00:21:29,015 --> 00:21:30,016
I'm sorry.

411
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:31,851
No, I'm just fucking with you,
I don't care.

412
00:21:31,884 --> 00:21:34,619
Jesus Christ,
it's not funny, Tom.

413
00:21:34,654 --> 00:21:35,121
[Chuckling]

414
00:21:35,154 --> 00:21:36,689
It was funny.

415
00:21:36,722 --> 00:21:38,523
You did become Amish, though.

416
00:21:38,556 --> 00:21:41,559
Well, it just goes against
my entire branding.

417
00:21:41,794 --> 00:21:44,830
Completely organic,
totally vintage vintages.

418
00:21:44,864 --> 00:21:48,500
Yeah but, this is like
part of the house anyway.

419
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:49,501
Isn't it?

420
00:21:49,534 --> 00:21:51,871
Well, I think about it
as part of the vineyard.

421
00:21:51,904 --> 00:21:54,907
Has anyone ever told you you're
just a little bit uptight?

422
00:21:54,941 --> 00:21:56,075
Yeah, you told me that.

423
00:21:57,143 --> 00:21:59,477
I just... I don't know.

424
00:21:59,511 --> 00:22:01,714
When I commit to something
an idea or whatever,

425
00:22:01,747 --> 00:22:04,549
an idea or whatever

426
00:22:04,582 --> 00:22:07,519
I like to really
fully commit to it.

427
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:09,789
I don't know,
I guess that's weird.

428
00:22:09,822 --> 00:22:10,823
It's not weird.

429
00:22:12,524 --> 00:22:14,794
Well, anyway,
I hadn't shown anybody

430
00:22:15,261 --> 00:22:19,198
and the only thing
missing down here is music.

431
00:22:22,268 --> 00:22:23,501
Not a word.

432
00:22:24,704 --> 00:22:25,938
I told you it was stupid.

433
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:27,239
It's not stupid.

434
00:22:28,774 --> 00:22:30,508
I guess the only question
that matters now

435
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:33,545
is what music
are you risking this all for.

436
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:48,560
Jesus.

437
00:22:48,593 --> 00:22:49,662
[Chuckling]

438
00:22:49,695 --> 00:22:51,931
Is it too early
to start drinking?

439
00:22:51,964 --> 00:22:52,631
[Chuckling]

440
00:22:52,665 --> 00:22:53,799
This is France.

441
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,968
Oh, boy!

442
00:23:02,074 --> 00:23:02,975
Hmm.

443
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:04,509
That's the old man's
special collection.

444
00:23:05,778 --> 00:23:08,114
Oh, yeah?
What makes them so special?

445
00:23:08,414 --> 00:23:12,517
They're his best years.
So his life's work, I guess.

446
00:23:13,352 --> 00:23:15,620
DAVID: Most of those 12
bottles have been here

447
00:23:15,654 --> 00:23:16,856
over a quarter century.

448
00:23:17,923 --> 00:23:19,591
That one, one down.

449
00:23:19,624 --> 00:23:20,592
- This one?
- No.

450
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:22,228
- That one?
- That one.

451
00:23:22,261 --> 00:23:23,863
Was bottled the year I was born.

452
00:23:23,896 --> 00:23:25,597
Oh, is it still good?

453
00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:29,668
DAVID:
Should be till I'm 75.

454
00:23:29,869 --> 00:23:32,671
but you never know
till you open 'em.

455
00:23:32,938 --> 00:23:33,973
Wait, there's...

456
00:23:34,006 --> 00:23:36,108
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...

457
00:23:36,142 --> 00:23:38,110
Yeah, there's 13 here, not 12.

458
00:23:38,444 --> 00:23:42,248
DAVID: Oh, that one.
That one was... was me.

459
00:23:43,282 --> 00:23:44,683
Oh, cool!

460
00:23:44,717 --> 00:23:45,751
[David chuckles]

461
00:23:45,785 --> 00:23:46,852
Yeah.

462
00:23:46,886 --> 00:23:49,955
Yeah, David Pyne.

463
00:23:49,989 --> 00:23:50,956
[Chuckles]

464
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,158
Here.

465
00:23:54,193 --> 00:23:56,295
Would it be sacrilegious
to drink from the bottle,

466
00:23:56,328 --> 00:23:57,897
Mr. Vintage Vintage?

467
00:24:02,068 --> 00:24:03,636
[Chuckles]

468
00:24:12,678 --> 00:24:13,279
[Gulping]

469
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,815
Mm, what is this?

470
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:17,917
Mourvèdre.

471
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,251
Mourvèdre.

472
00:24:19,285 --> 00:24:20,286
Mourvèdre.

473
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:22,620
You have to say it like that.
Mourvèdre.

474
00:24:22,655 --> 00:24:24,090
You've actually had it before.

475
00:24:24,123 --> 00:24:24,924
TOM:
Have I?

476
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:28,761
Yeah, we drank that on Dorset,
the night of the fight.

477
00:24:28,794 --> 00:24:29,728
[Gulps]

478
00:24:29,762 --> 00:24:31,730
No, not the night of the fight.

479
00:24:31,764 --> 00:24:33,966
The night that you got your ass
handed to you

480
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:35,134
at Muddy's.

481
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:35,701
DAVID:
Okay.

482
00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:36,869
You thought I forgot.

483
00:24:36,902 --> 00:24:39,271
Okay, there was two of 'em.

484
00:24:39,305 --> 00:24:40,906
And they were a head
taller than me.

485
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,675
Nobody is a head
taller than you.

486
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:45,811
And wait,
I was defending your honor.

487
00:24:45,845 --> 00:24:47,847
Yeah, which I definitely
didn't asked you to do,

488
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,714
by the way.

489
00:24:48,747 --> 00:24:53,385
Alright.
Well, I connected a few times

490
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:54,887
for the record, but no,

491
00:24:55,254 --> 00:24:57,189
it didn't exactly go the way
I imagined.

492
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,425
Yeah, well, I guess pub-fighting

493
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:01,894
Did you think I went to
Princeton?

494
00:25:01,927 --> 00:25:03,762
You think I went to Princeton?

495
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:08,167
Yeah, some northwestern
prep school.

496
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,768
I don't know.

497
00:25:09,802 --> 00:25:11,871
Or northeastern?
Where are those schools?

498
00:25:11,904 --> 00:25:13,072
Doesn't matter.

499
00:25:13,105 --> 00:25:14,006
[Chuckling]

500
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,941
I don't have your memory,
I don't know!

501
00:25:16,442 --> 00:25:18,377
Give me that.

502
00:25:19,445 --> 00:25:20,880
[Gulps]

503
00:25:24,216 --> 00:25:25,284
Why are you here, Tom?

504
00:25:25,784 --> 00:25:27,853
I told you,
I saw you on Instagram.

505
00:25:27,887 --> 00:25:29,722
Yeah? You go visit everybody
you come across

506
00:25:29,755 --> 00:25:30,756
on social media?

507
00:25:33,192 --> 00:25:34,960
Mm, maybe I have good memories.

508
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:37,963
You missed me.

509
00:25:38,531 --> 00:25:40,966
Mm, don't get hard about it.

510
00:25:42,368 --> 00:25:43,402
What's next for you?

511
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:44,970
Oh, I don't know.

512
00:25:45,004 --> 00:25:47,273
I haven't thought that far
ahead.

513
00:25:47,306 --> 00:25:49,241
You know, you might have gotten
predictable.

514
00:25:51,911 --> 00:25:53,445
I was actually thinking
maybe I could um,

515
00:25:53,946 --> 00:25:55,447
help out around here for a bit.

516
00:25:55,481 --> 00:25:57,349
Oh, with your extensive
gardening résumé?

517
00:25:57,383 --> 00:25:59,418
TOM:
Yeah!

518
00:25:59,451 --> 00:26:01,086
Or I dunno, I could be
like your personal barista

519
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,221
or something.

520
00:26:05,224 --> 00:26:06,192
You wanna stay?

521
00:26:06,225 --> 00:26:07,226
[music ends]

522
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:08,727
Maybe.

523
00:26:10,129 --> 00:26:11,897
DAVID: I could only
give you room and board.

524
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:14,466
What else do I need?

525
00:26:23,275 --> 00:26:25,911
- I have to warn you.
- Oh, I know.

526
00:26:25,945 --> 00:26:28,847
that one day I'll just
wake up with a start,

527
00:26:29,048 --> 00:26:30,849
and there'll be
a cold espresso machine,

528
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:32,184
and an empty ash tray,

529
00:26:32,218 --> 00:26:34,019
and this all would've been
a drunken memory,

530
00:26:34,253 --> 00:26:37,089
and your voice will echo
in my ears from years ago.

531
00:26:37,122 --> 00:26:39,792
And you'll say,
"I'll see you soon."

532
00:26:39,825 --> 00:26:40,726
I was actually gonna say,

533
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:42,861
"I don't make
pumpkin spice lattes."

534
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:45,064
No? I can live with that.

535
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:48,500
That's a deal.

536
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:55,074
ROSE:
You should grab a beer.

537
00:26:58,877 --> 00:26:59,878
Whose is that?

538
00:27:00,813 --> 00:27:01,914
ROSE:
It's Tom's.

539
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:05,150
Who's Tom?

540
00:27:05,484 --> 00:27:06,852
It's mine.

541
00:27:07,386 --> 00:27:08,821
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,371
How old is your son?

721
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,572
- 7.
- 4.

722
00:34:40,873 --> 00:34:42,709
We... we have two,
7 and 4.

723
00:34:42,742 --> 00:34:43,542
You think they're okay?

724
00:34:43,575 --> 00:34:44,309
ROB:
They're fine, they're fine.

725
00:34:44,342 --> 00:34:45,178
EM:
We should really FaceTime.

726
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,278
EM:
Why... why didn't we bring them?

727
00:34:46,311 --> 00:34:48,346
- Because they're monsters.
- That's so mean, yeah.

728
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,816
They're fine, they're fine.

729
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:51,383
Speaking about which,

730
00:34:51,416 --> 00:34:53,452
the Hobart children
are something, aren't they?

731
00:34:53,485 --> 00:34:54,553
They're good kids.

732
00:34:54,586 --> 00:34:55,587
They're thieves,

733
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,623
which is the nicest thing
I can think to say.

734
00:34:58,658 --> 00:35:00,358
Eating a few apples
from your tree

735
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:01,493
doesn't make them thieves.

736
00:35:01,526 --> 00:35:02,662
It certainly does.

737
00:35:02,695 --> 00:35:03,896
It technically doesn't.

738
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,464
Well, seems a bit extreme.

739
00:35:05,497 --> 00:35:06,766
No, it's not.

740
00:35:06,999 --> 00:35:08,034
More wine?

741
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:09,568
Oh yes, please.

742
00:35:09,601 --> 00:35:10,469
Oops!

743
00:35:10,502 --> 00:35:11,369
Sorry for that.

744
00:35:11,403 --> 00:35:11,938
Oh.

745
00:35:11,971 --> 00:35:12,604
[Chuckling]

746
00:35:12,638 --> 00:35:13,271
Yo.

747
00:35:18,443 --> 00:35:19,946
Does Madame Gérard have kids?

748
00:35:20,947 --> 00:35:22,547
- What do you think?
- No.

749
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:24,951
No.

750
00:35:30,555 --> 00:35:32,024
I was just about to tell
Madame Gérard

751
00:35:32,058 --> 00:35:33,492
about that conversation we had.

752
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,460
You remember camping
outside Big Sur?

753
00:35:35,762 --> 00:35:36,796
Yeah, I do.

754
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:39,498
So the um, the girls had a
late-night hangout sesh

755
00:35:39,531 --> 00:35:39,999
by the fire-pit.

756
00:35:40,032 --> 00:35:40,666
You remember that?

757
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,433
Mmhmm.

758
00:35:41,968 --> 00:35:44,369
You know, Tom is like
this amazing traveler.

759
00:35:44,402 --> 00:35:44,971
It'... it's...

760
00:35:45,004 --> 00:35:45,838
Mmhmm.

761
00:35:45,872 --> 00:35:47,572
She's been everywhere.

762
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:49,709
And she's the ultimate
of this lost

763
00:35:49,742 --> 00:35:52,945
or I should say
wondering generation,

764
00:35:52,979 --> 00:35:54,847
'cause not all who wander
are lost, right?

765
00:35:55,648 --> 00:35:56,481
So anyway, we were there

766
00:35:56,515 --> 00:35:59,317
and I was feeling loose,
shall we say?

767
00:35:59,351 --> 00:36:01,586
And we were asking
each other questions,

768
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,422
and I asked her you know,
if she wanted kids

769
00:36:04,456 --> 00:36:05,290
to have a family.

770
00:36:05,323 --> 00:36:07,927
Sort of a normal question
for a girl

771
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,663
or I should say a woman,

772
00:36:10,696 --> 00:36:12,832
for my generation,
and certainly yours,

773
00:36:12,865 --> 00:36:14,566
the question
of the ticking clock.

774
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:18,603
And she says... you know,
I think about this all the time.

775
00:36:18,805 --> 00:36:20,039
Tom, I really do.

776
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:25,343
She says, "Yeah, I want five."
Five kids.

777
00:36:25,377 --> 00:36:26,511
[Em chuckles]

778
00:36:26,545 --> 00:36:28,915
EM: I didn't wanna offend her.
She's my brothers...

779
00:36:28,948 --> 00:36:30,750
You know,
I mean, they were really close,

780
00:36:30,783 --> 00:36:32,852
but I had to know

781
00:36:32,885 --> 00:36:36,055
and I didn't understand how
she was going to have five kids

782
00:36:36,088 --> 00:36:39,324
with no steady job,
no steady anything.

783
00:36:39,926 --> 00:36:43,863
And she says,
"I'm not on birth control.

784
00:36:45,832 --> 00:36:46,799
I'm not on birth control

785
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:48,868
and I'm sure I'll have
the baby accidentally

786
00:36:48,901 --> 00:36:49,802
by the time I'm 30."

787
00:36:49,836 --> 00:36:50,837
ROB:
Babe.

788
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,772
Oh, I'm tipsy, aren't I?

789
00:36:52,805 --> 00:36:54,707
- No, no, no, it's okay.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry..

790
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,742
No, I just... I thought
it was the greatest thing,

791
00:36:56,776 --> 00:37:01,047
because why should the word
"accidentally" in that context

792
00:37:02,014 --> 00:37:03,816
be such a bad thing, right?

793
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:04,784
I mean, the way she said it,

794
00:37:04,817 --> 00:37:06,719
and I don't know
if you still feel this way,

795
00:37:06,752 --> 00:37:08,054
but the way she said it
it was like

796
00:37:08,087 --> 00:37:09,856
the guy was an afterthought.

797
00:37:09,889 --> 00:37:10,923
And I mean

798
00:37:11,324 --> 00:37:14,760
why should what she wants
be dependent on a guy?

799
00:37:14,794 --> 00:37:15,795
Okay.

800
00:37:16,095 --> 00:37:17,630
Uh, I'm paying her a compliment.

801
00:37:17,663 --> 00:37:18,597
No, no, no, no.

802
00:37:18,631 --> 00:37:20,465
It was a... a really big
thought for me then.

803
00:37:20,498 --> 00:37:22,434
It... it still is.

804
00:37:23,002 --> 00:37:25,037
And you know,
I think in that moment

805
00:37:25,071 --> 00:37:28,808
I really understood
why my brother is...

806
00:37:28,841 --> 00:37:31,844
Was so in love with you.

807
00:37:32,377 --> 00:37:34,914
Okay, maybe we should...

808
00:37:34,947 --> 00:37:37,515
Let's clean up.

809
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:39,151
- Clean-up time.
- Did I say too much?

810
00:37:39,185 --> 00:37:41,386
[Chuckling]

811
00:38:01,473 --> 00:38:03,643
Just catchin'
the best show in town.

812
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,610
You mean the only show in town?

813
00:38:05,645 --> 00:38:06,712
TOM:
Yes, I think.

814
00:38:09,715 --> 00:38:11,050
Are you tired of it, yet?

815
00:38:13,185 --> 00:38:16,923
DAVID: No. No,
it's the only thing I'm not tired of.

816
00:38:20,226 --> 00:38:22,028
So we're going to
the stables tomorrow,

817
00:38:22,061 --> 00:38:23,062
is that the plan?

818
00:38:23,362 --> 00:38:24,764
Yeah, I guess.

819
00:38:25,031 --> 00:38:27,867
Well, your enthusiasm is
overwhelming.

820
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,467
[David chuckling]

821
00:38:29,501 --> 00:38:33,505
Uh, just weird about
replacing things, I guess.

822
00:38:33,538 --> 00:38:34,572
What? Do you think?

823
00:38:35,641 --> 00:38:37,043
What's that supposed to mean?

824
00:38:37,076 --> 00:38:39,645
That you are weird about
replacing things.

825
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:40,746
Okay.

826
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,480
Come on, you've got tw... 13!

827
00:38:42,514 --> 00:38:44,984
You've got 13 bottles of wine
that you won't touch, because...

828
00:38:45,017 --> 00:38:46,018
I'm saving 'em.

829
00:38:46,052 --> 00:38:47,887
For what? Your wedding?

830
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,489
Your Amish
bond-raising championship?

831
00:38:51,523 --> 00:38:53,025
- Okay.
- Your funeral, my funeral?

832
00:38:53,693 --> 00:38:55,094
For someday.

833
00:38:57,964 --> 00:38:59,665
Okay, I know
what you're thinkin'.

834
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:00,967
I didn't say anything!

835
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,236
Yeah, well, I hear you.
There's no such thing.

836
00:39:07,773 --> 00:39:10,142
The trouble with that though,
is that some people

837
00:39:10,876 --> 00:39:15,147
have these weird body parts
uh, called "hearts".

838
00:39:15,513 --> 00:39:17,049
If you're not careful,
what they'll do

839
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:19,952
is they'll develop these
really inconvenient feelings

840
00:39:20,186 --> 00:39:21,654
called "attachment".

841
00:39:21,854 --> 00:39:22,888
That's gross.

842
00:39:22,922 --> 00:39:25,825
Uh,
and nothing like my childhood.

843
00:39:25,858 --> 00:39:26,792
Oh.

844
00:39:26,826 --> 00:39:29,862
No, but having a single dad
in the military,

845
00:39:29,895 --> 00:39:33,265
No. But having a single dad
in the military

846
00:39:33,299 --> 00:39:35,201
you do have to transition
very quickly.

847
00:39:36,302 --> 00:39:37,770
It was like every other year.

848
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,572
"Come on, we're going to
this new country

849
00:39:40,605 --> 00:39:42,241
or this new school,
you've got new friends,

850
00:39:42,274 --> 00:39:43,976
there's a new bed, new food."

851
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:46,544
And the food, that was the...

852
00:39:46,578 --> 00:39:48,714
Yeah, that was what
really got to me, the food.

853
00:39:48,748 --> 00:39:50,816
My dad was really
health-conscious, so...

854
00:39:51,784 --> 00:39:55,054
...we were never allowed
to eat at like fast-food joints

855
00:39:55,254 --> 00:39:57,123
or have boxed cereal
or any of that kind of stuff,

856
00:39:57,156 --> 00:39:58,090
you know?

857
00:39:58,124 --> 00:40:00,592
It always had to be
healthy, local things,

858
00:40:02,128 --> 00:40:03,696
like things that you
couldn't get just everywhere.

859
00:40:03,896 --> 00:40:05,898
And I was like
a really picky kid.

860
00:40:06,165 --> 00:40:08,634
So it was exhausting
deciding which new foods

861
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,236
I hated every single time.

862
00:40:10,269 --> 00:40:10,803
[Chuckling]

863
00:40:10,836 --> 00:40:12,171
It was a full-time job.

864
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,842
There was one thing
that I was allowed, though,

865
00:40:16,876 --> 00:40:17,877
from the store on base.

866
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:18,978
Oh, was it poptarts?

867
00:40:19,011 --> 00:40:22,148
No, it wasn't poptarts.
I wish it had been poptarts.

868
00:40:22,181 --> 00:40:24,750
[Sighs]

869
00:40:24,784 --> 00:40:25,785
It was peanut butter.

870
00:40:26,786 --> 00:40:30,990
Peanut butter has been
my like most constant thing.

871
00:40:31,023 --> 00:40:33,192
It's funny, that's one thing
you can't get in France.

872
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:37,096
Fuck. Do you think I'll live?

873
00:40:38,998 --> 00:40:40,633
[Sighs]

874
00:40:41,767 --> 00:40:43,636
You gotta get a new horse, dude.

875
00:40:43,903 --> 00:40:45,137
Yeah, I know.

876
00:40:45,171 --> 00:40:48,274
The grapes
are gettin' drier every day,

877
00:40:48,307 --> 00:40:53,012
which means less of a yield and
also...

878
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:55,314
What? Mr. Social Media?

879
00:40:55,347 --> 00:40:56,649
Yeah.

880
00:40:56,882 --> 00:40:58,017
But to his credit though,

881
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:00,686
I mean
he's been busting his ass.

882
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:02,188
I guess I have to.

883
00:41:05,057 --> 00:41:06,926
Come on, let's go.

884
00:41:07,326 --> 00:41:09,762
Where? Hey.

885
00:41:14,033 --> 00:41:14,900
Uh, what are we doin'?

886
00:41:14,934 --> 00:41:16,202
We're gonna
say "goodbye" properly.

887
00:41:16,235 --> 00:41:17,269
It helps you to move on.

888
00:41:17,503 --> 00:41:18,704
Or at least, I've heard.

889
00:41:19,305 --> 00:41:21,740
Tom, I don't think we should.

890
00:41:21,774 --> 00:41:23,109
So wait, where is the tree?

891
00:41:23,342 --> 00:41:24,910
Listen, I'm serious.

892
00:41:24,944 --> 00:41:26,946
This isn't that important
and I got a pretty good

893
00:41:26,979 --> 00:41:28,948
long-standing relationship
with my neighbor right now.

894
00:41:28,981 --> 00:41:30,783
Look, if we get caught,
I'll take 100% of the blame,

895
00:41:30,816 --> 00:41:31,217
alright?

DANIEL:
What's your friend's name?

1781
01:19:10,442 --> 01:19:13,045
That? That's Captain Dave.

1782
01:19:13,579 --> 01:19:14,480
Captain Dave?

[Chuckles]

1784
01:19:15,314 --> 01:19:17,282
Captain Dave! Hey!

1785
01:19:17,616 --> 01:19:19,985
Dankeschön, Captain Dave.

1786
01:19:20,687 --> 01:19:22,521
Is it everything
you hoped it would be?

1787
01:19:23,122 --> 01:19:25,958
Yeah, I think my preteen-self
was onto somethin', yeah.

1788
01:19:27,393 --> 01:19:28,927
You ever have a day
where you look back,

1789
01:19:29,995 --> 01:19:32,498
you realize you wouldn't change
a single thing if you could?

1790
01:19:35,267 --> 01:19:37,202
DAVID: I don't remember the
last time I felt like that.

1791
01:19:41,006 --> 01:19:42,241
Don't look at me like that.

1792
01:19:42,642 --> 01:19:43,676
Like what?

1793
01:19:44,176 --> 01:19:46,311
I'm your pixie dream girl
or something.

1794
01:19:47,513 --> 01:19:48,981
DAVID:
Aren't you kinda, though?

1795
01:19:49,014 --> 01:19:50,949
I'm exactly zero
of those things.

1796
01:19:59,224 --> 01:20:01,226
Oh, shit, bad.

1797
01:20:04,463 --> 01:20:08,635
Well, there's gotta be
a not-too expensive hotel room

1798
01:20:08,668 --> 01:20:09,468
around here.

1799
01:20:09,501 --> 01:20:11,336
We only have enough
for the repair.

1800
01:20:12,438 --> 01:20:15,274
Okay. That's okay.

1801
01:20:20,279 --> 01:20:21,280
You comfortable?

1802
01:20:21,313 --> 01:20:22,347
I'm good. Are you good?

1803
01:20:22,381 --> 01:20:23,382
I'm good.

Hey!

1806
01:20:31,023 --> 01:20:32,224
The year you were born.

1807
01:20:32,257 --> 01:20:34,460
Oh, we're finally back
to the beginning.

1808
01:20:35,494 --> 01:20:37,730

1810
01:20:40,132 --> 01:20:41,433
Did you ever have that moment

1811
01:20:42,167 --> 01:20:44,102
where you realized
for like the first time

1812
01:20:44,136 --> 01:20:47,105
that you're not
a young person anymore?

1813
01:20:47,506 --> 01:20:48,540
Yeah.

1814
01:20:49,241 --> 01:20:52,010
I've been feelin' like that
a lot in the last few years.

1815
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:57,249
Why? What do you think about
when you feel that way?

1816
01:20:57,684 --> 01:21:00,352
I've been realizing that
like other people look at me

1817
01:21:00,385 --> 01:21:02,454
and they don't see me
as a kid anymore.

1818
01:21:04,223 --> 01:21:05,491
I'm 30.

1819
01:21:08,494 --> 01:21:10,262
I'm just... no, I'm older.

1820
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:13,432
I'm older than my dad was
when he had me.

1821
01:21:13,833 --> 01:21:15,467
Makes me think about how

1822
01:21:16,602 --> 01:21:19,404
societies have rituals to decide

1823
01:21:19,438 --> 01:21:22,374
when you're really young,
though.

1824
01:21:22,407 --> 01:21:23,408
Yeah.

1825
01:21:24,576 --> 01:21:26,044
What do you think
the closest thing

1826
01:21:26,078 --> 01:21:27,112
we have to that now is?

1827
01:21:27,145 --> 01:21:30,449
I don't know.
Gettin' married, havin' a kid.

1828
01:21:31,383 --> 01:21:33,686
God, what if you don't want
either of those things?

1829
01:21:34,386 --> 01:21:36,221
Makin' love on a beach
in France.

1830
01:21:36,255 --> 01:21:36,956
Blugh.

1831
01:21:36,990 --> 01:21:40,459

We're not doing this!

What do you mean
we're not doing it?

1837

'Cause we're old enough to know
that having sex on a beach

is a really dumb fucking idea.

- Uh, no, you're not old.
- I am.

whose was it?

I mean, I know it wasn't ours.
Right?

It wasn't yours.

it was a coincidence

that Gwen died.

really stupid, but...

she was supposed to come.

Oh, fuck, man.
Don't... don't do that.

1877

The fate?
It was divine intervention?

run off with her?

you should tell him that,

maybe come out
with him,

01:27:37,316 --> 01:27:39,752
"One makes wine
to appreciate it,

1954
01:27:39,785 --> 01:27:44,056
but one drinks wine
to appreciate everything else."

1955
01:27:44,589 --> 01:27:45,590
Oh.

1956
01:27:47,693 --> 01:27:48,961
Is this your father?

1957
01:27:49,527 --> 01:27:51,529
Does he look that old?

1958
01:27:52,031 --> 01:27:57,069
No, it's Fridriech.
He was my husband.

1959
01:27:57,103 --> 01:28:00,072
Oh! when did he pass?

1960
01:28:00,572 --> 01:28:03,943
Passed? He's still alive,
as far as I know.

1961
01:28:05,678 --> 01:28:06,679
Thank you.

1962
01:28:06,879 --> 01:28:09,649
He lived on a boat
in Chile now.

1963
01:28:10,182 --> 01:28:13,886
MADAME GÉRARD: He sails it every
year, back and forth, back and forth.

1964
01:28:15,655 --> 01:28:17,823
He was always quite romantic.

1965
01:28:37,509 --> 01:28:38,778
Oh..

1966
01:28:40,212 --> 01:28:41,180
That's my father.

1967
01:28:41,213 --> 01:28:42,682
Oh!

1968
01:28:46,752 --> 01:28:48,654
So is that what the property
used to look like?

1969
01:28:48,688 --> 01:28:50,555
The property?
No, it's not here.

1970
01:28:50,990 --> 01:28:52,725
I arrived here much later.

1971
01:28:53,092 --> 01:28:57,797
That must have been
the Austrian cottage, yes.

1972
01:28:58,631 --> 01:28:59,632
Where are you from?

1973
01:28:59,865 --> 01:29:02,600
All over. All over.

1974
01:29:03,601 --> 01:29:07,707
My father was a pilot you see,
so we moved around a lot.

1975
01:29:19,785 --> 01:29:22,554
So tell me
why did you come here?

1976
01:29:22,955 --> 01:29:24,924
Why does everybody
keep asking me that?

1977
01:29:25,191 --> 01:29:28,593
Oh, I was just curious.
I don't want to be a repetitive.

1978
01:29:28,928 --> 01:29:30,096
TOM:
No, it's fine.

1979
01:29:30,129 --> 01:29:31,596
It's... it's not um...

1980
01:29:33,565 --> 01:29:34,566
Mm.

1981
01:29:37,670 --> 01:29:41,207
I don't know.

1982
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:44,176
I went home for my dad's funeral
this year.

1983
01:29:45,277 --> 01:29:47,813
And it was the first time
I'd seen him in two years.

1984
01:29:53,185 --> 01:29:58,556
Everyone came, like the kids,
and in-laws and their kids.

1985
01:30:02,328 --> 01:30:05,231
I was standing
on the um, family plot

1986
01:30:06,098 --> 01:30:07,633
that we have and

1987
01:30:08,267 --> 01:30:11,837
just covered in cigarette butts,
and beer cans, and junk,

1988
01:30:12,738 --> 01:30:15,041
I realized
that if my dad hadn't had kids

1989
01:30:15,074 --> 01:30:16,208
no one would be there.

1990
01:30:18,944 --> 01:30:21,579
You know, except for
the mortuary chapel dude

1991
01:30:21,613 --> 01:30:24,050
and some of his insane cousins.

1992
01:30:25,151 --> 01:30:27,787
So I don't know, I guess that
has something to do with it.

1993
01:30:30,256 --> 01:30:34,060
MADAME GÉRARD: Did I mention he
called earlier, the young man?

1994
01:30:35,995 --> 01:30:37,897
He's never called
on the phone before.

1995
01:30:38,664 --> 01:30:39,665
No, you didn't.

1996
01:30:42,001 --> 01:30:47,306
Apparently, Tuesday will be
our last lunch together.

1997
01:30:53,045 --> 01:30:56,282
So are you gonna give me
advice or something?

1998
01:30:57,349 --> 01:30:58,851
Isn't that why
you invited me here?

1999
01:30:58,884 --> 01:31:02,221
No.
I just wanted to have the chance

2000
01:31:02,254 --> 01:31:03,956
to meet you properly.

2001
01:31:05,257 --> 01:31:07,126
After hearing so much,
you know?

2002
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:09,695
You never know what to expect.

2003
01:31:11,730 --> 01:31:15,600
You must have known that from
our very first lunch together.

2004
01:31:16,368 --> 01:31:19,138
He would talk about the girl
with the boy's name.

2005
01:31:19,472 --> 01:31:20,673
No. I didn't.

2006
01:31:22,942 --> 01:31:26,245
MADAME GÉRARD: I wish I have
some advice for you now.

2007
01:31:29,949 --> 01:31:31,050
Do you love him?

2008
01:31:32,818 --> 01:31:34,587
Yeah. I mean...

2009
01:31:38,324 --> 01:31:39,859
I definitely care
about him

2010
01:31:40,326 --> 01:31:42,294
more than I thought
I'd ever care about a guy.

2011
01:31:44,897 --> 01:31:47,199
And if someday
I wanted to have a family,

2012
01:31:47,233 --> 01:31:48,367
I guess he could be that.

2013
01:31:48,767 --> 01:31:51,737
If? Someday?

2014
01:31:52,104 --> 01:31:53,105
I know.

2015
01:31:53,873 --> 01:31:55,941
MADAME GÉRARD: What can I
tell you that you don't know?

2016
01:31:59,979 --> 01:32:03,182
Whatever you decide,
you will look on it

2017
01:32:03,482 --> 01:32:05,050
many years from now,

2018
01:32:05,651 --> 01:32:10,256
and you'll smile, and also
you'll feel a profound sadness.

2019
01:32:13,225 --> 01:32:16,362
Whatever you decide, it will be
very happy and very sad.

2020
01:32:19,298 --> 01:32:20,299
It's fucked.

2021
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:22,067
Yeah.

[Chuckling]

2023
01:32:23,302 --> 01:32:25,371
MADAME GÉRARD:
I like this expression.

2024
01:32:26,172 --> 01:32:27,173
It's fucked.

2025
01:32:29,141 --> 01:32:30,843
There's nothing quite like it.

2026
01:32:31,810 --> 01:32:32,978
What do they say after?

2027
01:32:33,279 --> 01:32:35,714
Oh, pardon my French.

2028
01:32:36,148 --> 01:32:37,283
Yeah. They do.

2029
01:32:41,921 --> 01:32:44,723
So what made you decide
to settle down?

2030
01:32:44,757 --> 01:32:47,293
I didn't settle down,
I just got married.

2031
01:32:47,326 --> 01:32:49,061
I don't know. It happened.

2032
01:32:51,230 --> 01:32:55,367
He took me sailing
across the Atlantic

2033
01:32:55,935 --> 01:32:59,271
on a boat we bought by selling
all of our possession.

2034
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:02,474
It was the size of this room.

2035
01:33:03,643 --> 01:33:06,045
MADAME GÉRARD: We made the same
route that they used to make

2036
01:33:06,078 --> 01:33:07,913
when they crossed
in the old day

2037
01:33:07,947 --> 01:33:10,015
for the New World,
as they called it.

2038
01:33:13,185 --> 01:33:14,820
That was very romantic.

2039
01:33:16,155 --> 01:33:19,425
There's a region along the way
in the subtropics

2040
01:33:19,458 --> 01:33:22,928
where the sea becomes
perfectly still.

2041
01:33:24,897 --> 01:33:27,800
It's because, you see, there's
two high-pressure winds

2042
01:33:27,833 --> 01:33:29,969
on either side,
and in the middle nothing.

2043
01:33:30,002 --> 01:33:34,440
So there's nothing you can do
and you're stuck there for days

2044
01:33:36,008 --> 01:33:39,278
until you find a little current
that you can hold onto

2045
01:33:39,578 --> 01:33:41,780
that pulls you out of it.

2046
01:33:44,550 --> 01:33:47,987
That was the best time
we ever spent together.

2047
01:33:50,356 --> 01:33:54,860
Nothing on the horizon,
nothing to do but drink.

2048
01:33:56,929 --> 01:34:01,967
Rum, I think it was.
Or gin.

2049
01:34:03,902 --> 01:34:05,771
No, a dark rum.

2050
01:34:06,872 --> 01:34:09,441
Oh, shit.
Why can't I remember?

2051
01:34:17,549 --> 01:34:19,318
Will you take
some fruit with you?

2052
01:34:20,886 --> 01:34:22,021
I have too many.

01:34:31,130 --> 01:34:32,831

pretty fucking good.

France or something?
