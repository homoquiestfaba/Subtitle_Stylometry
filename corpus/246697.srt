1
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,285
Come on, baby. Alright?

2
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:34,853
Hurry up.

3
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,149
So impatient.

4
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:41,692
I'll stop being impatient
when you stop being on the clock.

5
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:43,787
Well then,

6
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:47,788
what's your pleasure?

7
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,627
The works.

8
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,499
Honey...

9
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:02,961
How about dinner?

10
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:04,091
How about it?

11
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:05,829
Would you buy me dinner?

12
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:08,197
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

13
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,536
That's all I ever hear
out of your mouth.

14
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:11,541
Forget it.

15
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,644
Alright, I'll buy you dinner.

16
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,579
Leave that ass of yours in here
alright?

17
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:17,876
I gotta get out of here.

18
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,464
What's your pleasure, Miss?

19
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,904
Jack and Coke for starters.

20
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:52,482
You're new here.

21
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:53,974
Yeah.

22
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,521
Yeah, I know I'd remember you.

23
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,288
You got a good head
for remembering people?

24
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,657
You got to in my line of work.

25
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,922
I'm meeting someone here.

26
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,795
- Gordon Yeardly.
- Gordo?

27
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,165
He came in here about an hour ago.

28
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,169
You're meeting him, huh?

29
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,634
I didn't figure you
for a working girl.

30
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,505
Honey, I'm always working.

31
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,408
Well, you're kind of late.

32
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:24,346
He's already went to the VIP suite
with Dusty.

33
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,916
I'm afraid you missed out.

34
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,021
We'll see about that.

35
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,625
Thanks, honey.

36
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,561
Hey. Count on it. Thank you.

37
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,362
How are the cards running?

38
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,837
I don't know. I just... got here.

39
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:58,113
I'm really bad at counting.
Maybe you can help me.

40
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:04,254
I can help you all you want.

41
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,197
Gordon, Mr. Halston wanted me
to give you these winnings.

42
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,134
That's a pretty big wad.

43
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,233
Cashing out and taking a long trip.

44
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,973
Really? And we just met.

45
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:30,975
There's always time for a pit stop.

46
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,325
I'm ready.

47
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,628
Beat it.

48
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,087
You promised me dinner.

49
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,720
I said scram!

50
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,631
Who's this?

51
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,100
Never you mind.

52
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,095
I'll see you when I get back.

53
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,433
Don't bet on it.

54
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,702
Heck of a guy.

55
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,338
What can I say?

56
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,238
Ladies love me,

57
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,346
but you'll find that out soon enough.

58
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:10,919
Hit me.

59
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,681
No problem.

60
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,451
Gordon Yeardly,
you're under arrest.

61
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,822
What are you, a cop?

62
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,727
Worse, a bounty hunter.

63
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,026
Hey, what's going on?

64
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,691
I've got this.

65
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,366
Sorry Miss,
you'll have to take this outside.

66
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,406
You know what,
this can go nice or nasty.

67
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,702
You decide.

68
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:34,236
Let's take a walk.

69
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,316
So, what do you think?

70
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:14,553
Interesting.

71
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,289
Very interesting.

72
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,289
So, are you going to
post bond for him?

73
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,698
Well he's kind of risky,
wouldn't you say?

74
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,826
I mean, he has skipped out
on the last two tickets he's had.

75
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,736
Yes, but he's got really
good reasons for both of them.

76
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,435
Yeah, there always is.

77
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,873
Well, he's the only brother I've got

78
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:44,109
and I promised my parents
that I would look out for him.

79
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:47,881
Well, if you need my advice,

80
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,784
I would say...
you're not doing such a good job.

81
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,227
Listen...

82
00:09:58,731 --> 00:09:59,959
don't get upset.

83
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,270
You know, he's the only family
I've got left.

84
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:13,477
I'd hate to think of him
sitting in a jail.

85
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,780
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do.

86
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:25,084
I'll take a look at his rap sheet
and see what I come up with,

87
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,326
but I may have to call you
for further information.

88
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,161
That's alright.

89
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,095
I just want you to know something.

90
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,767
I'll do anything...

91
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,167
Anything at all.

92
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:43,599
Anything?

93
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,939
Anything to help my brother.

94
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,082
Knock, knock.

95
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:56,086
- Jesus Christ!
- I got a ticket to punch.

96
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,348
Can't it wait until tomorrow?

97
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,923
Spare me.

98
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:02,516
Look, I can see that you're busy.

99
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,823
Will you call me tonight?

100
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,228
I will definitely call you tonight.

101
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,492
Well, alright.

102
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,802
And don't you worry about a thing.

103
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,368
Laying it on a little thick
aren't you, Benny?

104
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,580
Hey, what goes on between
me and my potential clients

105
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,210
are none of your concern.

106
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,819
So they're potential clients, now?

107
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:30,887
Give me your ticket.

108
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:35,117
Gordon Yeardley,
a snatch that bedazzles.

109
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,528
Car pulled outside the city?

110
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,931
Trying to cash out and take off.

111
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,669
I knew it. I knew it.

112
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,367
Never doubt my instincts.

113
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,065
Speaking of instincts,

114
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,643
you ever think of
redecorating this place?

115
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,541
I mean it's a bit seventies.

116
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,480
You know I like things
just the way they are, J.C.

117
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,386
You up for another run?

118
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,119
Always.

119
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:10,853
That's what I like about you,

120
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,228
you're eager.

121
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,362
This is a special one.

122
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,060
Oh, let me guess.

123
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:21,472
Guy gets arrested, skips bail,
he takes off, I catch him.

124
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,165
What's the difference?

125
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,137
You ever hear of a guy named...

126
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,004
Franco Maretta?

127
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,341
Button man for the mob.

128
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,446
One and the same.
One and the same.

129
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,985
He got squeezed last week.

130
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,112
The D.A. Office got him.

131
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,554
He's going to testify
against the mob?

132
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,523
Smart guy.

133
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:46,996
Well, that was the plan,
but now, he's in the wind.

134
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,623
And you posted bail?

135
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,065
Stupid.

136
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:54,229
Hey. His money is just
as green as anybody elses.

137
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,506
You know,
I've never taken in a mob guy.

138
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,634
This could be pretty interesting.

139
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,707
Well, JC, I'm not taking any
chances with this guy.

140
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,578
Have I ever let you down?

141
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,946
No, but to cover my ass,
I'm bringing in help.

142
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,387
I work alone.

143
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,356
That's no fun.

144
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,392
Oh no. Not this jackass.

145
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,294
Now, is that any way to speak
of your coworker?

146
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,461
You totally screwed up
the Gonzalez case.

147
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:23,295
Try again.

148
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,528
It was you sneaking in through
the back that scared him off.

149
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,468
That was all mine.
I did all the legwork.

150
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,973
Hey. Knock it off, both of you.

151
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,407
Now, this guy needs to be brought in

152
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:38,176
and I want my best hunters
on this and that's you two.

153
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,410
Like or not, that's the deal.

154
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,383
I'm not working with him.

155
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,750
And I'm not crazy about
working with her.

156
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:47,347
Hey, I don't care how you do it.

157
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,358
Just bring him in.

158
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,591
Hey, I say it whole buddy.

159
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,669
The first person
who brings him in gets the loot.

160
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,102
- May the best man win.
- Screw you.

161
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:19,816
I'll be ready to go to court
in a week.

162
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:20,252
Listen, there's no deal.

163
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,486
Your client was found asleep

164
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,995
with the murder weapon
was under his pillow.

165
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,998
Tell me how that was circumstantial.

166
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:33,071
Fine. File a motion.
I'll see you in court.

167
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:35,733
Hello. J.C.

168
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,266
How's it going?

169
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,674
I sent the check. I mailed it today.

170
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,543
Did I say anything about a check?

171
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,172
It's been crazy here.
I mean...

172
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,911
I'm backed up with motions
two judges called in sick.

173
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,782
Don't take it out on me.

174
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:50,752
What do you want?

175
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,687
Christ, you're in a mood.

176
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:56,352
I'm sorry. How are you?
You look good.

177
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:59,259
Thanks, so do you.

178
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,262
You've been working out?

179
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,230
Whenever I can.

180
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,730
I haven't heard from you
in a couple of weeks.

181
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,168
How are you?

182
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,207
That's what happens
when you get divorced, Tom.

183
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:13,038
Now, who's in the mood?

184
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:13,507
That reminds me,

185
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,479
we were always quick
to get into a fight, weren't we?

186
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:19,311
Yeah. Makeup sex
was pretty damn good.

187
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,282
Yeah, it was.

188
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,619
I know I'm not supposed to
go there, but... I miss you.

189
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,455
I think you're lonely and desperate.

190
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,151
And you?

191
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,855
Never desperate.

192
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,056
Lonely?

193
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,723
Shut up and kiss me.

194
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,659
So Tom?

195
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,734
So JC?

196
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:47,464
I have to admit that there was
a reason I came here to see you

197
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,041
Besides screwing my brains
out on my desk?

198
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,440
That was a distraction.

199
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:54,444
What's up?

200
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:55,878
Franco Marreta.

201
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:56,981
Stay away.

202
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,241
Come on.

203
00:21:58,383 --> 00:21:59,315
I mean it, JC.

204
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,009
The Colores family isn't a crowd
that you want to mess with.

205
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,088
From what I hear, he's traveling solo.

206
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:06,452
All the more reason.
That makes him more dangerous.

207
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:07,752
Give me a break.

208
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,622
JC, you always do this.

209
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:11,956
You dive into these situations
without thinking about it.

210
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:15,658
I know exactly what I'm doing
and I'm damn good at it.

211
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:18,361
You can either help me or not.

212
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,629
You make the call.

213
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,164
You're so damn stubborn.

214
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:25,242
Yeah, so?

215
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,977
If I help you,
I want to be in on the arrest.

216
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,912
I'm not splitting my bounty
with the cops.

217
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,814
Listen, if you get to him first
I'll make sure you get the credit.

218
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,046
I just don't want you
bringing him in alone.

219
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,350
You help me. I'll help you.

220
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,495
This guy's probably dead already.
I mean... they hate rats.

221
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:45,722
A rat you made.

222
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,559
Oh, spare me.

223
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,499
Here's a list of his...

224
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,502
known whereabouts
and previous acquaintances.

225
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:54,562
Promise me.

226
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,230
Promise me
that you'll keep me informed.

227
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,343
Admit it, I'm better at this
than the cops.

228
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,374
- Promise.
- I promise.

229
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:07,084
Hmmm.
What?

230
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,416
Oh, just some names that I recognize.

231
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,120
See ya.

232
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,583
See ya.

233
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,589
Hey, we don't want anymore trouble.

234
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:49,785
Oh good. Neither do I.

235
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,923
Do you have a hostess here
by the name of Dusty?

236
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:56,124
I'm not at liberty
to discuss our employees.

237
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,600
I thought
you didn't want any more trouble.

238
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,964
She's in the V.I. P room.

239
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,700
Alone?

240
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:05,969
On a break.

241
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,806
See, that wasn't hard, was it?

242
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,850
Dusty, got a minute.

243
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:20,186
A minute's going to cost you.

244
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:21,952
I'm not here for action.

245
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,357
I just want some answers.

246
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,431
You're that bounty hunter
that grabbed up Gordon.

247
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:28,997
Yeah.

248
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:33,365
Good for you.
I didn't like him much anyway.

249
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:35,439
Is that who you wanted to talk about?

250
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,268
No, actually. Franco Marreta.

251
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,900
Don't know him.

252
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:41,410
Really?

253
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:44,208
The district attorney's office
said that you did.

254
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,283
Well, that's their problem.

255
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,318
Seems he was a regular here.

256
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:52,219
Spent a lot of time in the V.I. P room
and you've never heard of him?

257
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:53,756
No.

258
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:56,383
Never played hostess for him?

259
00:24:56,528 --> 00:25:00,328
Look, I'm with a lot of guys.
I can't keep track of them all.

260
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,626
I'm not here to hurt you.

261
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:06,967
I'm just here to find this
Franco guy and take him in.

262
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:11,235
I don't want any trouble
with him or his mob buddies.

263
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:13,640
Who said he was in the mob?

264
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:16,747
I might've heard things.

265
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,110
What things?

266
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,480
Nothing, ok?

267
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,015
Now, leave me alone,

268
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,711
prance your pretty little head
out of here,

269
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:27,313
because I don't have to answer
any of your questions.

270
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:29,450
Ok.

271
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:34,155
But if you hear nay more things
give me a call.

272
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,425
I'll make it worth your while.

273
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,769
I make this in ten minutes.

274
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,338
Good for you.

275
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:50,746
You're a smart girl, Dusty.

276
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:51,845
Maybe some day,

277
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:54,213
you'll be smart enough
to get out of this business.

278
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:34,953
Hello, Dusty.

279
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,757
Oh, a slumber party.

280
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,952
Oh, how tender.

281
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:52,393
Whoa.

282
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,447
Hello?

283
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:50,979
Whoa.

284
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,404
Move it and lose it.

285
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:19,371
Christ!

286
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,909
What the hell are you doing here.

287
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,137
The same thing you're doing here.

288
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,872
We're on the same assignment,
remember?

289
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,777
You're trying to follow me
to drop on Franco.

290
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,908
Hey, I don't share secrets
with my competition.

291
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,280
I should shoot you.

292
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,014
Meanwhile, you let me
grab your gun, sloppily.

293
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,021
Look, who's the one
with the prick up your nose?

294
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,093
I let you spin me.

295
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,024
Get your own lead.

296
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,322
No.

297
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:43,594
Have you ever worked
with your mouth wired shut?

298
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,463
Shit!

299
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,397
What happened?

300
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,942
Someone came in the back
and shot at us.

301
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,045
Call 911.

302
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:55,942
Come on.

303
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,480
Did you see who did it?

304
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,315
No, it happened too fast.

305
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,419
- I'm out of here.
- No one's going anywhere.

306
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,388
Cops and ambulance are on their way.

307
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:18,525
Ladies, put on a pot of cocoa.
It could be a long night.

308
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,707
What's going on?

309
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:24,830
A gunshot wound.

310
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:27,103
Victim was taken to first general.

311
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,713
Nothing serious. Just grazed her arm.

312
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:32,577
Meanwhile, we have two
hotshot bounty hunters

313
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:35,652
staking out the place.
A lot of good they did.

314
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,118
He didn't do anything.

315
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,719
What's with the get up costume?

316
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:41,882
Is the circus in town?

317
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:43,550
Actually, I was at dinner
with the mayor.

318
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,219
The last thing I want to do
is come here

319
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:46,660
and take care of this mess.

320
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,199
Well, maybe if your boys in blue
did their job a little better,

321
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:51,996
we wouldn't have to go running
all over town

322
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,398
chasing escaped felons.

323
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:54,505
You got a problem, pal?

324
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,231
You want to go? We can go.

325
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,501
Listen! Knock it off, alright.

326
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,804
Officer, may I speak with the witness?

327
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,105
Yes, sir.

328
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:05,448
Look, I'm not going to hang around
here all night while he plays cop.

329
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:06,948
I don't think we have a choice.

330
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:10,120
Listen, the longer we stay here
the longer Marreta has to get away.

331
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:17,820
Officer, can you take
this witness downtown

332
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:18,986
to make a statement?

333
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,130
I got to go to work.

334
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,860
After you make a statement.

335
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:29,699
You mind telling me what's going on?

336
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:30,739
What did she say?

337
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,206
I ask the questions here.

338
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,141
Look, earlier this evening,
I was talking to Dusty,

339
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,010
the working girl who got shot.

340
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,773
I thought that she knew
more than she was saying.

341
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:41,407
So, I thought I'd sit on her
and see what happened.

342
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:42,849
You didn't see the gunman?

343
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:45,251
I was distracted.

344
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:47,686
I see.

345
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:48,985
Don't get smug with me, Tom.

346
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,319
I thought you were going to
keep me informed.

347
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:51,291
Nothing happened.

348
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:52,418
You called that nothing?

349
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:55,691
That girl just identified
the shooter as Franco Marreti.

350
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,323
- He was here?
- That's right.

351
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,436
The guy half the police force
is looking for shows up

352
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,696
and tosses off a few rounds

353
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:02,772
a hundred feet
from where you're standing,

354
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:04,272
while you're watching.

355
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:05,376
Nice work, JC.

356
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,875
I can see
while you're the best at this.

357
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:08,171
Why didn't she say that before?

358
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:09,506
Why would she say anything to you two?

359
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:10,614
Do you have any more questions?

360
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:13,216
- I just might.
- Good, then put them down in writing.

361
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:26,191
Hey, don't let that stuffed
asshole back there get to you.

362
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:28,892
That stuffed asshole is my ex-husband

363
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,762
and he's got a good point.

364
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,201
If we were on the ball,
we could've gotten to Franco.

365
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:35,363
I hate to admit it.

366
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:39,306
So do I,
but I think we should team up.

367
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,938
- Pool our resources.
- Share the bounty.

368
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,110
- Deal.
- Deal.

369
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,244
I'll go convince Dusty
to stay away from him.

370
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,619
You take the front with Jasmine.

371
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:54,520
Good plan.

372
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,923
There's something about this story
that doesn't seem right to me.

373
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:58,585
Get going. I'm going to head off.

374
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,244
I don't know why I'm staying here.

375
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,973
I told you that it's not safe.

376
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,241
It's not fair, is what it is.

377
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,907
Look, I'm sorry about
what happened to you.

378
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,747
I want to help.

379
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:26,585
Jasmine told me that
it was Franco who shot at you.

380
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:33,530
Well, I didn't exactly see who it was.

381
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:37,100
So, if Jasmine said it was Franco,
then that's that.

382
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:40,432
You've been with Franco
at Dazzle's haven't you?

383
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,337
Yeah, a bunch of times.

384
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:46,035
I was his favorite girl.

385
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,078
Now, we're getting somewhere.

386
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:53,278
I don't know why he would
do this to me, though.

387
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:57,514
Maybe you know something that he
doesn't want anyone else to know.

388
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:00,454
That's it, isn't it?

389
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,953
Stupid mobsters.

390
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:08,163
They think they're so cool
with their stories.

391
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:14,296
My god, they pay us by the hour
we don't even care what they do.

392
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,397
He told you things?

393
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,309
I don't even know you.

394
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,647
Look Dusty, I'm the only one
sticking my neck out for you.

395
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:28,616
Tomorrow morning, the cops
will be here and all over you

396
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:31,051
offering protection and then
there's nothing that I can do.

397
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,089
I can't take protection from the cops.

398
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:36,193
I can't even tell them what I know.

399
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,761
I can help you. Trust me.

400
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,423
I'm tired.

401
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:43,966
I know.

402
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:46,535
Let's get some of your things
and go to my place.

403
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,637
How are we doing tonight, gentleman.

404
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:29,707
It's about time you showed up.

405
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:31,712
Just holler if you need anything.

406
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:35,413
What's your hurry, darlin'?

407
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,987
I told you. I don't know anything.

408
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:40,215
Let me ask first.

409
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:43,221
Is there a problem?

410
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,418
No. Actually, we were just
getting acquainted.

411
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:46,860
Isn't that right, darlin'?

412
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,932
Let's take this off the floor.

413
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,162
Lead the way.

414
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:00,767
Look, I told you that I told the cops
everything that I know.

415
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:03,404
Will you relax?

416
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:06,411
Pour me one of those.

417
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:13,950
This is some setup
you girls have going on here.

418
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:16,559
Private club, nobody bothers you.

419
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:20,425
What? I guess you kick back
30 or 40% to the house?

420
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,590
- Fifty.
- Fifty? Man,

421
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:25,929
you do all the work
and they make all the money.

422
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:30,002
It's not like we have a union
or anything.

423
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:33,133
Let's talk about Franco.

424
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:34,335
Let's not.

425
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,748
Look, if you want to talk and drink,

426
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,816
we can do that downstairs, at the bar.

427
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:43,044
Once you pass through those doors,
you're on the clock.

428
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,322
It's all business with you.

429
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:48,088
Fine...

430
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,463
now I'm paying for your time,
so we can talk all I want.

431
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,463
What if I don't feel like talking?

432
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:02,138
Then I guess we'll sit here
and stare at each other for an hour.

433
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:03,999
What do you want from me?

434
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,675
I want you to trust me.

435
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,511
I'm sure that's all you want from me.

436
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,477
Look, you are sexy

437
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,783
and I would love
to hit the sheets with you.

438
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,514
Happy? But I'm working here.

439
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:20,489
Really?

440
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:24,520
Besides, I know about you and Dusty.

441
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:29,962
Just because me and Dusty hook up
doesn't mean that I don't like boys.

442
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,966
Boys or men?

443
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:34,503
Men.

444
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:52,723
What about being on the job?

445
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:54,017
Off the record.

446
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:00,686
So, is this going to be
business or pleasure?

447
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:03,261
I don't know.

448
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,595
I'll tell you later.

449
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:06,996
Fair enough.

450
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,245
Oh, yeah...

451
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:59,085
You do like that, don't you?

452
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:12,066
I like it harder.

453
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,330
Oh, yeah...

454
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:20,368
Oh, yeah...

455
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:44,651
Yes... yes!

456
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,896
Think you can trust me now?

457
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,166
I can.

458
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:59,832
Let's get out of here
and go somewhere where we can talk.

459
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:01,766
I get off in two hours.

460
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:07,075
Hello?

461
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:08,940
Where in the hell is my witness?

462
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:10,376
Asleep in my bed.

463
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,675
Listen, I need to talk to
this Dusty character.

464
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,817
I don't think she's going to talk to
you or anyone else in authority.

465
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:19,416
Let me guess.
She's opened up to you.

466
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:20,420
She's starting to.

467
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:24,049
She definitely knows something
but if you push too hard, she'll run.

468
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:26,492
I can't wait for her
to get over her jitters.

469
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,997
I can't have my star witness running
around shooting innocent citizens.

470
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:31,431
So noble.

471
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:32,557
JC!

472
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:36,036
Look, let me spend some time with her.

473
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:39,802
I really think that
she could lead me to Franco.

474
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,105
I don't know why
I give you so much leeway.

475
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:45,340
Because, deep down,
you know I can do the job.

476
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:48,985
I promise that I'll keep you informed.

477
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:54,487
Look, about earlier,
about the things I said,

478
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:56,688
I don't rally blame you.

479
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,849
I'm sorry.

480
00:44:57,995 --> 00:44:58,859
It's ok.

481
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:00,861
You were right,

482
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:02,898
but I really appreciate your apology.

483
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,466
Ok, so then we're clear?

484
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:08,196
We're clear. You know something?

485
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:09,305
What?

486
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,566
This is the first conversation

487
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:14,144
we've had where we haven't ended up
in a fight or in bed.

488
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:16,712
Well, I got some time.

489
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,513
- Good night, Tom.
- Good night.

490
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:33,259
Dusty, oh my god. How are you?

491
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:35,098
What happened?

492
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:36,564
I'm ok.

493
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:37,999
Oh, my God!

494
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,495
What's the story?

495
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:43,003
They didn't want to talk
until they were both together.

496
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,505
Ok, so let's do it.

497
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,345
Ok, ladies, we've got to
sort this out.

498
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:53,540
How do we know that we'll be safe?

499
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:55,311
You're safer with us than the cops.

500
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:57,886
Bounty hunters have a lot of leeway.

501
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:00,353
Well, how is that going to stop
the mob from coming after us?

502
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:03,460
Don't worry, we'll stop them.

503
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:05,255
So, what's it going to be?

504
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:08,125
Are you going to tell us
what you know so we can help you?

505
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:10,556
We do know Franco.

506
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:12,669
In fact, we've been working for him.

507
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:14,600
How?

508
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:16,365
Well,

509
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:19,772
when the feds started tapping
the Gallarus family hangouts,

510
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:24,073
they still needed information
so they used us as a go-between

511
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:27,581
Frank would come into the club,
take us into the VIP room

512
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:31,620
for a couple of hours and later
when one of the bosses would come buy

513
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:34,622
we'd give him al the information
that he gave us.

514
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:37,556
I thought one of
the other families own Dazzles.

515
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:40,026
Why would they
let the Gallarus family use it.

516
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:43,656
Honor among thieves and a big payoff.

517
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,702
Plus everybody hates the feds.

518
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:48,966
So, what kind of things
did Franco tell you?

519
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:51,233
Names, numbers, that kid of stuff.

520
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:52,307
Boring.

521
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:55,741
Do you recognize
any of the names there?

522
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:01,015
I think one of those
is a Senator or something.

523
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,140
That's it.

524
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:05,483
He sometimes passed on information
about meetings between people.

525
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:07,613
Yeah, Franco had me do that
last month.

526
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:11,524
He had me meeting a guy
named Auriana?

527
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:12,754
Luis Auriana?

528
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:14,693
That's him.

529
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,663
Who's that?

530
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,165
They just fished Luis Auriana

531
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:20,270
out of the river
with a bullet in his eye.

532
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:24,200
That makes you two accessories
to murder.

533
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,832
Look, let's not get ahead
of ourselves, here.

534
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,773
Dusty, I'm not fooling around.

535
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:30,971
I need to find this Franco character.

536
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:32,105
Do you know where he's at?

537
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,980
He was going to tell us about
where all this money was

538
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:38,850
so we could bring it to him.

539
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,183
Why would he come your place
and try to kill you?

540
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:42,314
He probably thought we were
going to try to rip him off

541
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:43,426
and take his money.

542
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,994
We never even got a chance
to get the money.

543
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:47,688
That doesn't make sense.

544
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:48,798
You know how these guys are.

545
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:50,900
You look at them crosseyed
and they shoot you.

546
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,899
Why wouldn't get just
get his own money?

547
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,300
Because he hit it at Dazzles.

548
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:58,636
So, he wouldn't go there,
because they think he's a rat.

549
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,141
So did he tell you
where to take it?

550
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:04,543
He has a farm out in the country
I wrote down the address.

551
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,512
Does anyone else know where this is?

552
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:07,742
Just us.

553
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,910
You think he still might be in there?

554
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,486
It's worth taking a look.

555
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,222
I'll go.

556
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:18,692
No. Let me.

557
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,527
I want you to stay here
and keep an eye on these two.

558
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:25,026
This isn't you trying to pull
some kind of fast one, is it?

559
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:26,157
Give me a break.

560
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:29,431
I'm just going to go up there.
If I find him, I'll call you.

561
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,336
Meanwhile,
don't let them out of your sight.

562
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:34,103
There's something about their story
that doesn't sit well with me.

563
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,474
Let me guess. Women's intuition?

564
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:38,547
Too bad, you don't have it.

565
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:40,707
Don't worry.
They'll be safe with me.

566
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:41,818
We're hungry.

567
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:46,548
Then go get something to eat.
Don't bother me.

568
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:04,799
Yeah.

569
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,637
Hey Tom, it's me.

570
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:07,744
Did you find him?

571
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:10,847
No. But I've got a really strong lead.

572
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:12,471
Who'd you get it from?

573
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,379
Jasmine and Dusty.

574
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:16,748
I told you that they knew more
than what they were saying.

575
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,582
Where are you? I'll send backup.

576
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:20,713
I don't need backup.

577
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:23,690
JC, I'm not fooling around here
alright?

578
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:25,351
Neither am I.

579
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:27,486
I'll call you when I find them.

580
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,109
Yeah, it's me.

581
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:41,335
We've got a problem.

582
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:15,035
Ring, ring.

583
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:19,814
Yeah.

584
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,042
I'm here.

585
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,276
Did you find him?

586
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:23,579
No.

587
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,779
Just getting ready to scope out
the place.

588
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:26,820
How's our guests?

589
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:27,582
They're fine.

590
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:29,589
Just chattering away in the bedroom.

591
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:31,557
You've got to keep an eye on them.

592
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,925
What would you like me to do,
sit on them?

593
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:35,463
If you have to.

594
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,361
Fine.

595
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,297
Call me if you find anything.

596
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:39,299
Fine.

597
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:45,133
I'll watch them, dammed it.

598
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,543
Ladies.

599
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:53,348
Shit.

600
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:01,717
Hi.

601
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:03,984
What are you doing?

602
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:06,823
What does it look like we're doing?

603
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:09,431
Ok, as long as you're both safe.

604
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:11,558
Oh, our hero.

605
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:12,725
Right.

606
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:14,936
Hey Lance,

607
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,203
Jasmine told me about you two.

608
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:20,632
Really?

609
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:23,035
She says you're really good.

610
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:24,671
She's right.

611
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,746
And cocky, too.

612
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:30,213
Would you like to join us?

613
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:31,447
In there?

614
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,748
To start.

615
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:35,890
Doesn't look like there's room.

616
00:51:36,493 --> 00:51:37,858
We can make room.

617
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:42,657
Help us.

618
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,067
Look,

619
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:25,073
we can't tell JC about this, alright?

620
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:28,143
What is she,
your girlfriend or something?

621
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,770
No, but I don't think
she'd understand.

622
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:34,748
She doesn't know how to have fun

623
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:38,610
Speaking of which
I think we're ready for another round.

624
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:42,653
I think I need a little time.

625
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:47,322
Come on. Let's get kinky.

626
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:50,632
Ok, I like that. I'll play along.

627
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:53,225
Hey!

628
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:15,057
What are you doing?

629
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:21,163
Don't worry.
We're not going to tell anybody.

630
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:28,835
Yes, it's done. He's all yours.

631
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:31,065
Remember the deal.

632
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,041
Fine, we'll be at the club.

633
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:40,947
You're just going to leave me.

634
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:41,948
Sorry, baby.

635
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:43,985
You were good, but not that good.

636
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,087
It's time to go.

637
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:47,415
Bye.

638
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:48,955
Wait!

639
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:49,649
Come back.

640
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:51,990
You cant just leave me here.

641
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:52,685
Help.

642
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:55,389
Bounty hunter locked up
in his own handcuffs.

643
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,659
Not good. Come back.

644
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,030
Who sent you?

645
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:29,688
I ask the questions.

646
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:33,468
Frank Morita, I presume.

647
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,435
I'm taking you in.

648
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,563
Just you. Give me a break.

649
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,708
It looks like you're
the one in bracelets.

650
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:43,336
What are you, a cop?

651
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:44,810
Bounty hunter.

652
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:45,846
Terrific.

653
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:47,973
Hey, these things are kind of
pinching me a little bit.

654
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,750
What's so funny?

655
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:54,652
You're kind of whiny
for a ruthless hitman.

656
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:57,058
Don't believe everything you hear.

657
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,092
By the way, Dusty's fine.

658
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:01,287
That's good to hear.

659
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,729
I guess that we'll add attempted
murder to your rap sheet.

660
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:05,060
Come again.

661
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:08,102
Jasmine pointed you for tossing
shots at her and Dusty.

662
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:09,636
When?

663
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,467
Don't be cute.

664
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,041
Listen, I just spoke to
Jasmine an hour ago.

665
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:14,939
She didn't say anything
about any shots.

666
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:16,511
What?

667
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,176
You're not the only one
with a cell phone.

668
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:34,063
Oh., Gallarus' thugs.

669
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:35,221
You led them right to me.

670
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:36,696
I wasn't followed.

671
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:38,460
Tell them that.

672
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:39,659
Come on.

673
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:07,991
Well, if it isn't the little rat.

674
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:10,361
It took you long enough to find me.

675
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,627
You like all this fresh air?

676
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:17,534
Well, maybe you won't choke
when you dig your own grave.

677
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:20,234
No one's digging anything.
Drop your guns.

678
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:24,277
Next time, I don't miss.

679
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:26,245
Say hello to the bounty hunter
who caught me.

680
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:35,824
You want to keep playing?

681
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:37,826
I'd be more help
if you got me out of these.

682
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,018
You got it.

683
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,992
Franco,
you and your girlfriend are dead

684
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:45,600
Dead!

685
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:46,861
Shut up.

686
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:51,031
What are you doing?

687
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:53,472
Let's get out of here
before more goons show up.

688
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,199
What's that?

689
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:56,834
It's Dusty's address.

690
01:01:56,979 --> 01:01:58,970
These are probably the guys
who tried to knock them off.

691
01:01:59,115 --> 01:01:59,911
Come on.

692
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,207
I'm still taking you in.

693
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:04,979
Well, then I'm as good as dead.

694
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:07,749
I've got contacts at the D. A's office.

695
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,653
Tom Cooper promised
that you'd be safe.

696
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:10,258
Oh, Christ!

697
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:11,690
Tom Cooper's the guy I'm running from.

698
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:12,417
What?

699
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:13,995
The guy's been on the take for years.

700
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:15,427
That's a lie.

701
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:16,554
I have proof.

702
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:18,326
Why do you think there's never
been a major prosecution

703
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:20,231
of the Gallari family?

704
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:21,996
The D.A. Is in their back pocket.

705
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:23,935
Shut up and get in the car.

706
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:24,903
Hey, you don't want to believe me?

707
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:27,202
- I'm telling you the truth.
- I said shut up.

708
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:28,332
Fine. Fine.

709
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:45,620
Is this really necessary?

710
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,127
You tell me.

711
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,924
Believe me, I'm tired of running.

712
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:50,896
But you're so good at it.

713
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:53,299
Don't you want to know the proof
I have about Cooper?

714
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,336
I don't believe a word you're saying.

715
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:57,629
Then believe this.

716
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,904
The mob never likes
writing things down.

717
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:01,944
Me, I've got to keep records.

718
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:04,911
Take a look at that
and tell me what you think.

719
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:06,608
Why do you trust me?

720
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:07,807
Because you didn't take me in.

721
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:08,746
Yet.

722
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:11,078
Yet, you still didn't do it.

723
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:14,121
So maybe, just maybe,
you think I'm telling the truth.

724
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:18,126
I want to prove that to you.

725
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:24,829
And bring me back some food.

726
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:06,500
Yes, kiss my butt.

727
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,579
Come on, come on.

728
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:52,648
Benny?

729
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:54,172
If I've told you once,

730
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:56,717
I've told you a thousand times
to freaking knock.

731
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:58,615
Listen, I got to talk.

732
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:00,883
Did you ever hear of a phone?

733
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:02,752
I'm serious.

734
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,951
Listen.

735
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:09,091
It's ok. I know the routine.
Call me.

736
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:10,095
I will.

737
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:11,497
Before you say anything, don't.

738
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:14,097
I'm actually dating her.

739
01:06:14,236 --> 01:06:16,761
Is that what you're calling it?

740
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:22,242
I'm serious. She could be the one.

741
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:24,346
Did you ever think that
she might be playing you?

742
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:28,109
Oh, man.

743
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:30,242
Look, I don't have time to talk
about your love life.

744
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:31,648
I've got Franco.

745
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:33,311
Alright. Bring him in.

746
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:34,718
Not so fast.

747
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:36,984
What do you mean "not so fast"?

748
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:39,354
The D.A.'s office is on the take.

749
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:40,655
If he goes in,

750
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:43,822
they'll turn him over
to the Gallari family.

751
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:46,025
Now, who's being played?

752
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:48,898
They named Tom specifically.

753
01:06:49,705 --> 01:06:50,467
Oh, boy.

754
01:06:52,074 --> 01:06:53,268
What's this?

755
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:55,809
I'm Detective Simpson.
This is my partner, Detective Jensen.

756
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:56,639
Evening.

757
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:57,768
J.C. Lang?

758
01:06:57,913 --> 01:06:58,777
Yeah?

759
01:06:58,914 --> 01:07:00,939
We came by to ask Benny
how we could find you

760
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:02,414
this will make it easier.

761
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:03,381
What do you mean "easier"?

762
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:06,682
J.C. Lang, you're under arrest
for the Murder of Lance Hall.

763
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:07,413
- What?
- Let's go.

764
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:08,853
You have the right to remain silent.

765
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:09,389
Benny!

766
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,015
Anything you say
can and will be used against you

767
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:12,751
- in a court of law.
- I'm on it. I'm on it.

768
01:07:12,895 --> 01:07:13,827
You have a right to an attorney.

769
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:14,691
Get me out of this, Benny!

770
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:17,264
If you do not have an attorney,
one will be provided for you.

771
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:28,608
How are you doing?

772
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:29,608
Doing?

773
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:30,609
How am I doing?

774
01:07:30,746 --> 01:07:33,271
I'm in a jail cell on murder charges
I don't know anything about.

775
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:34,678
How do you think I'm doing?

776
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:35,715
Ok, let's calm down.

777
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:37,512
Oh, you come in here and calm down.

778
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:38,745
Hey, I'm trying to help you.

779
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,287
Then what the hell's going on?

780
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:41,583
A caller phoned in a tip,

781
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,316
said there were gunshots
at your house.

782
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:44,289
The police came over

783
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:46,657
and found Lance handcuffed
to your bed, dead.

784
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:49,356
The gun that was used was yours
and it was right next to his body.

785
01:07:49,498 --> 01:07:51,363
Do you honestly think
I'd be that sloppy?

786
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,330
I mean, what's my motive?

787
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:53,230
J.C., listen.

788
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:55,030
What about the working girls
that he was looking after?

789
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:55,828
Gone.

790
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:57,302
Great.

791
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:01,334
Did you find Franco on the farm?

792
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:03,206
No. No ones up there,

793
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:05,303
but I got some strong leads
and I'm working on them,

794
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:07,712
but I cant do anything in here.

795
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:09,977
Listen, I know that this is all

796
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:11,643
trumped up,
circumstantial evidence.

797
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:13,812
But you still managed
to get me arrested.

798
01:08:13,956 --> 01:08:16,516
I had to. I was just doing my job.

799
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:19,890
I didn't have anything to do
with Lance's murder.

800
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:20,893
J.C. Listen.

801
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:23,692
I'll do everything I can
to make this go away.

802
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:25,867
Alright. Alright.

803
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:26,797
Let her out.

804
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,233
What's this?

805
01:08:28,337 --> 01:08:29,827
It's called bail, Tom.

806
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:30,904
It's what I do.

807
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,702
Good. I'm glad. J.C., call me.

808
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:34,775
Sure.

809
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,241
How are you doing, J. C?

810
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:37,472
Get me out of here.

811
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:44,647
Did you look at this?

812
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:45,947
No way.

813
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:48,049
Come on. Let's go.

814
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:42,710
I thought you'd forgotten about me.

815
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:45,973
I was afraid that
I was going to chew my arm off.

816
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:49,017
What's the matter?

817
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:51,619
You found out that
I was telling the truth?

818
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:53,244
It's all a bunch of numbers
and initials.

819
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:55,619
It's hardly a smoking gun.

820
01:09:55,758 --> 01:09:57,225
Well, match these numbers
with the deposits that

821
01:09:57,359 --> 01:09:59,657
were made into these accounts.

822
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:01,558
How hard is that?

823
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,722
Things got a little complicated.

824
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:06,096
I was arrested for murder.

825
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:07,395
Who?

826
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:10,164
The guy that I was working with
to catch you.

827
01:10:10,306 --> 01:10:12,672
Did he know where
you were coming to look for me?

828
01:10:12,808 --> 01:10:14,366
Yeah.

829
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:16,239
And that's how they found us.

830
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:20,007
They got to him to look for me.

831
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:22,481
Lance would never talk.

832
01:10:22,618 --> 01:10:26,213
You'd be amazed at what someone would
say with a gun pointed to his head.

833
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:29,791
Tom knew. He asked about the farm.

834
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:31,389
Huh?

835
01:10:32,127 --> 01:10:34,857
Tom asked if I found you at the farm.

836
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:36,191
I called him on the way up,

837
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:39,301
but I never mentioned that
I was going to a farm.

838
01:10:39,435 --> 01:10:42,063
He must've tipped off
those two thugs to get to Lance

839
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:44,502
and then, eventually, get to us.

840
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:49,939
You get grabbed up on murder charges.

841
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,546
To slow me down.

842
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,580
That's what it sounds like.

843
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:56,879
He also got Jasmine to blame you
for the shootings,

844
01:10:57,019 --> 01:10:59,453
which means he didn't want
the thugs to get caught,

845
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:01,783
so they could finish
what they started.

846
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:04,917
He not only had deals
with Jasmine and Dusty,

847
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:05,958
but also with the Gallaris.

848
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:08,120
That son of a bitch.

849
01:11:09,865 --> 01:11:11,628
I don't know what to think anymore.

850
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:16,267
I'm sorry.

851
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,132
What I don't understand is
how you fit into the picture.

852
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,141
I mean you're supposed to be
this ruthless hitman

853
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,439
and that that's hardly what you are.

854
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:28,308
What's the matter? I don't scare you?

855
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:29,974
That's not it.

856
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:33,919
I know a murderer
and you're not a murderer.

857
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:37,753
I'm a lover. Sorry, bad joke.

858
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:43,598
What's your story?

859
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:48,094
Growing up in my neighborhood,
the mob guys were everywhere.

860
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:55,608
They had the best clothes,
the best cars, the best women.

861
01:11:56,945 --> 01:11:58,435
I wanted to be one of them,

862
01:12:01,016 --> 01:12:02,574
but I wasn't a wiseguy.

863
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:05,546
I did know about numbers.

864
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:07,978
Gambling?

865
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:11,820
No, accounting.

866
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:15,960
Hey, give me a break.
It's what I was good at.

867
01:12:17,566 --> 01:12:20,626
I was working for the Gallaris family,
doing their books.

868
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:25,633
As a joke, some of the guys
made up a joke that...

869
01:12:25,774 --> 01:12:27,503
I had been killing people.

870
01:12:29,244 --> 01:12:31,474
The next thing you knew,
the rumors started flying

871
01:12:32,147 --> 01:12:35,583
and people started looking at me
very differently.

872
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:39,783
There was actually a lot of fear
in their eyes.

873
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:41,515
And you liked that?

874
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:44,353
I have to admit that I did.

875
01:12:45,594 --> 01:12:47,687
And then things got way out of hand.

876
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:48,819
Drugs?

877
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:49,623
I was stupid.

878
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:53,098
I was carrying packages
back and forth.

879
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:58,495
The cops found out

880
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,507
and I was threatened
with some serious jail time.

881
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:03,908
So, why did Tom offer protection?

882
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:06,314
It was all a show.

883
01:13:08,283 --> 01:13:10,808
But if Tom was in on it,
why would it happen?

884
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,413
Because shit runs down hill.

885
01:13:14,089 --> 01:13:17,320
The new mayor puts pressure
on the Attorney General,

886
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:19,518
he puts pressure on the D.A.s.

887
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:23,894
The D.A.'s squeeze the A.D. A's
like Tom.

888
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:27,296
So Tom's supervisors
knew nothing about this?

889
01:13:27,436 --> 01:13:29,802
That's the beauty of the plan.

890
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,198
A guy like tom's job

891
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:35,935
is to make sure stuff doesn't go
any higher.

892
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:39,836
Do you mind?

893
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:53,591
What were you going to do on the run?

894
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:55,594
Well, I was the guy
who kept the books,

895
01:13:55,731 --> 01:13:58,757
I have a little stash set
aside for myself.

896
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:01,199
I hid it over at Dazzles.

897
01:14:02,037 --> 01:14:03,868
That's what Dusty told me.

898
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:07,806
Right. She and Jasmine called me
just before all this happened.

899
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:09,433
I told her where it was.

900
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:11,135
And you trusted them?

901
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,313
I just thought that,

902
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:19,319
because we had spent time together,
that there was a bond between us.

903
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,423
I thought I could trust them.

904
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:22,590
I was stupid.

905
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:24,749
There... you happy?

906
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:27,985
It looks like we both put
our trust in the wrong people.

907
01:14:35,204 --> 01:14:36,262
What are you thinking?

908
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:39,931
What my next move should be?

909
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:42,134
You can always testify.

910
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:46,144
I wouldn't live long enough
to finish one sentence.

911
01:14:50,686 --> 01:14:51,710
Let me ask you something.

912
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:54,179
Do you like your job?

913
01:14:55,357 --> 01:14:56,346
For now, it's working.

914
01:14:56,492 --> 01:15:00,155
It's what I identify with,
like you and the wiseguys.

915
01:15:01,129 --> 01:15:03,620
I notice that
you haven't taken me in yet.

916
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:05,963
Isn't that breaking some kind of law?

917
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:09,161
I'm not bound to the same laws
as the cops.

918
01:15:09,304 --> 01:15:12,501
You're just a reward to me.
I can take you in at any time.

919
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:14,141
So, is that it?

920
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:17,507
I'm just some guy
with a price tag on his head?

921
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,977
In the beginning, it was like that?

922
01:15:20,115 --> 01:15:21,639
And now?

923
01:15:21,783 --> 01:15:24,513
Now, things have gotten
a little complicated.

924
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:26,381
I got to you, didn't I?

925
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,149
Don't get so cocky?

926
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:30,315
What can I say, I got the goods.

927
01:15:30,459 --> 01:15:34,020
I'm not a working girl.
You don't need to impress me.

928
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:40,658
No. You're a girl on the run,
just like me.

929
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:44,367
Suddenly nothing makes sense
and you're scared.

930
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:47,465
Welcome to my world.

931
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:53,982
I'm a lot of things,
but scared isn't one of them.

932
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:01,685
I'm tired of running.

933
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:49,603
Dammit!

934
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:53,003
What's the rush?

935
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:55,082
I thought that
we'd have breakfast in bed.

936
01:20:55,217 --> 01:20:56,980
Of course, we'd have to
get a bed first.

937
01:20:59,254 --> 01:21:00,551
How are you doing?

938
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:01,986
Good, now.

939
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:04,720
Where am I going to go?

940
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,293
I need you to keep me safe.

941
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:12,632
Benny, hey.

942
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:17,630
Yeah, I know where Franco is.

943
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:22,634
Hey, I need a favor.

944
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:32,212
Got a minute?

945
01:21:32,787 --> 01:21:33,754
Always for you.

946
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:36,257
Did you find Franco?

947
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:37,790
I did.

948
01:21:37,926 --> 01:21:39,894
Well, where is he?
Let's get him locked up.

949
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:41,050
Hold on.

950
01:21:41,196 --> 01:21:42,857
He told me some things about you

951
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:45,931
that you've been taking bribes
from the Gallaris family.

952
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:49,866
He's a scumbag and a crook.
Don't believe anything he says.

953
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:51,333
I know all about this guy.

954
01:21:51,473 --> 01:21:53,498
I don't believe anything.

955
01:21:53,642 --> 01:21:55,872
Besides, I trust you.

956
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:57,635
That's good.

957
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:01,839
You look really nice tonight.

958
01:22:01,983 --> 01:22:03,450
Do you have a date or something?

959
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:05,576
This is it, baby?

960
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,153
Really?

961
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:12,954
Slow down.

962
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:14,823
You want to get it all over you, huh?

963
01:22:19,134 --> 01:22:20,658
What's wrong?

964
01:22:20,802 --> 01:22:22,793
Just checking to see
if you were wearing a wire?

965
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:25,770
A wire?

966
01:22:25,907 --> 01:22:26,896
Shut up.

967
01:22:30,545 --> 01:22:32,069
So, the rat told you everything?

968
01:22:33,515 --> 01:22:36,678
He just told me that
you've been taking bribes for years.

969
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,378
Did he tell you how much?

970
01:22:39,521 --> 01:22:40,419
No.

971
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:42,783
Because it's nothing.

972
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:45,521
I've been keeping those
scumbags out of jail for years

973
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:47,651
and how do they repay me?
Shit.

974
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:51,595
I cant believe this.

975
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:55,294
You think you've got it
all figured out, don't you?

976
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:57,405
I know where all the skeletons
are buried.

977
01:22:57,539 --> 01:22:59,097
I'm about to make a big play.

978
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:00,571
It's time for an early retirement

979
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:02,370
and the Gallaris family
is going to pay for it.

980
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:05,604
I cant believe that you've been lying
to me for all these years.

981
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:07,374
You're so pathetic.

982
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:10,712
JC Lang, the great bounty hunter.

983
01:23:10,852 --> 01:23:14,720
Is that how you get off,
chasing down guys?

984
01:23:14,856 --> 01:23:16,915
Always did have to be in charge
didn't you?

985
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:19,455
Times have changed.

986
01:23:22,464 --> 01:23:24,398
Who are you calling?

987
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:28,758
A special friend to take care of you.

988
01:23:28,903 --> 01:23:31,565
Just like they took care of
that Lance character.

989
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:34,535
So, you did tip off the hit men
to get to Lance.

990
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:37,941
They killed him and then
they came after me and Franco.

991
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:39,137
Yeah, I did.

992
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:40,945
They made a mess of it.

993
01:23:41,082 --> 01:23:43,312
Just like they made a mess of
those two hookers.

994
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:45,442
They figured they knew
where Franco was hiding

995
01:23:45,587 --> 01:23:47,612
and it turned out that
they were right.

996
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:49,417
I had to go in and clean it up.

997
01:23:49,557 --> 01:23:51,184
Here's the great thing,

998
01:23:51,326 --> 01:23:53,794
I cut a deal with Dusty and Jasmine.

999
01:23:53,928 --> 01:23:55,862
They get a
"Get out of jail free" card

1000
01:23:55,997 --> 01:23:58,056
and I get Franco's stash.

1001
01:23:58,199 --> 01:23:59,860
Perfect plan.

1002
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:03,164
Those girls are playing you
like they're playing me.

1003
01:24:03,271 --> 01:24:04,329
They led me to Franco,

1004
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:05,996
because they knew where his stash was.

1005
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:07,799
They were hoping I could catch him.

1006
01:24:07,942 --> 01:24:11,378
They've been wanting
to rip him off the whole time.

1007
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:13,947
And you trust that.

1008
01:24:14,082 --> 01:24:15,344
Those girls know that
if they cross me,

1009
01:24:15,483 --> 01:24:17,713
they'll end up just like Lance.

1010
01:24:17,852 --> 01:24:20,412
My god, what happened to you?

1011
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:23,486
Welcome to the real world.

1012
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:25,616
You grab what you can while you can.

1013
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,752
It's not that America's Most
wanted crap that you play

1014
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:33,357
The only problem is you're not good at
your games Tommy, but me...

1015
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:34,763
I'm very good.

1016
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:39,297
Can I help you gentlemen?

1017
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:39,805
Yes.

1018
01:24:39,941 --> 01:24:42,205
Tom Cooper, you're under arrest.

1019
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:43,743
What is this?

1020
01:24:44,712 --> 01:24:46,373
You think that just because
I don't have a wire

1021
01:24:46,514 --> 01:24:49,039
that I'm not being transmitted?

1022
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:52,848
Yeah, Benny.

1023
01:24:57,425 --> 01:24:59,017
- Take him in.
- Let's go, Cooper.

1024
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:01,060
It's a long way from over.

1025
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,408
I just wish that I could've seen
the look on his face.

1026
01:25:14,542 --> 01:25:16,134
Priceless.

1027
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:18,905
Now, you can testify and not worry.

1028
01:25:19,047 --> 01:25:20,480
I can't do that.

1029
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:21,707
Franco.

1030
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:23,613
J.C., just because the rats are
out of the D.A.'s office

1031
01:25:23,751 --> 01:25:25,412
doesn't mean I'm clear.

1032
01:25:25,553 --> 01:25:28,545
Gallaris will never let me live
to stand trial.

1033
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:31,250
Well, there's always
witness protection.

1034
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:33,590
That's not for me.

1035
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:35,924
What are you going to do?

1036
01:25:37,432 --> 01:25:41,493
I don't know.
I just wish I had my nest egg.

1037
01:25:43,638 --> 01:25:46,266
Well, maybe there's some way
that I can help with that.

1038
01:26:20,108 --> 01:26:22,440
That's pretty cool that
the D.A. Got arrested.

1039
01:26:22,577 --> 01:26:25,774
And we're the only ones
who know about the money.

1040
01:26:26,548 --> 01:26:28,743
- Here's to men.
- Here's to suckers.

1041
01:26:34,055 --> 01:26:34,749
Room service.

1042
01:26:34,889 --> 01:26:35,913
Come in.

1043
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:50,067
What do you think we should
give him for a tip?

1044
01:27:01,683 --> 01:27:02,581
You know, ladies.

1045
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:04,548
The next time you go on
a spending spree,

1046
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,347
you might want to be
a little more discreet.

1047
01:27:29,877 --> 01:27:31,606
Well, I guess this is it for a while.

1048
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:33,077
You never know.

1049
01:27:33,214 --> 01:27:36,650
Without Tom covering for them,
the Gallaris might go sown.

1050
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:39,378
If they do, maybe I'll come back.

1051
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,748
Where are you going?

1052
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:44,422
If I tell you,
it would cause more trouble.

1053
01:27:44,559 --> 01:27:47,551
You don't think I couldn't find you?

1054
01:27:47,695 --> 01:27:51,654
Actually I'd like to be hunted by you.

1055
01:27:51,799 --> 01:27:53,426
Count on it.

1056
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:30,034
The End.
