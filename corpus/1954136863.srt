1
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,064
Let's go.

2
00:00:56,066 --> 00:01:00,201
Wait, wait, wait.
Can we go, just the two of us?

3
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:03,805
Look, if this is gonna work,
you two need to get along.

4
00:01:03,807 --> 00:01:05,606
She doesn't like me.

5
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:08,376
Well, it takes effort
from both sides.

6
00:01:11,313 --> 00:01:15,683
She's had a hard time lately,
that's all I'm saying.

7
00:01:15,685 --> 00:01:18,453
Come on, you know I didn't
mean anything by it.

8
00:01:18,455 --> 00:01:20,521
Just come.

9
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,792
OK.

10
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:27,195
But you're gonna
make it up to me later.

11
00:01:27,197 --> 00:01:30,698
OK, I will.
I mean with dinner... out.

12
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:33,701
Yeah, OK.

13
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:44,445
Look at how many of you there are.
Oh, cool.

14
00:01:44,447 --> 00:01:46,747
You think all the you's are
thinking the same thing?

15
00:01:46,749 --> 00:01:49,217
Yeah, they're thinking,
"Get me out of this TV."

16
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:50,551
I can't believe you're
doing homework.

17
00:01:50,553 --> 00:01:54,589
AP classes.
Um, you girls better clean up.

18
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:57,658
Emmy, get ready.
We're leaving in a half.

19
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,728
Is she going?
Yes, she's going.

20
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,432
Can't I just stay here?
We're leaving in a half.

21
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:08,436
She's so fake.
She seems nice.

22
00:02:08,438 --> 00:02:10,304
Yeah, too nice.

23
00:02:10,306 --> 00:02:12,573
Yeah, well, at least
she leaves you alone.

24
00:02:12,575 --> 00:02:16,611
My step-mom always wants to hang out,
even bribes me with wine coolers.

25
00:02:16,613 --> 00:02:17,845
It's pitiful.

26
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,784
This is actually a really
good price for 70 acres.

27
00:02:23,786 --> 00:02:25,887
We foreclosed on this
house eight months ago.

28
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:29,657
It's only now just coming on the market.
That's sad.

29
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:32,927
It's not so sad.
It had to go to somebody.

30
00:02:32,929 --> 00:02:36,764
OK, peeps.
Lunch?

31
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:41,736
Lunch, for sure.
OK, I see how it is.

32
00:02:41,738 --> 00:02:44,172
Ah, well, at least we
agreed on something.

33
00:02:44,174 --> 00:02:47,175
Yes, we do... at last.

34
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,334
Well, what do we think?
Got anything else?

35
00:03:39,695 --> 00:03:42,330
Jesus, man, you shouldn't
sneak up on people.

36
00:03:42,332 --> 00:03:44,498
Sorry about that.

37
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,801
Not too keen on the
neighborhood, huh?

38
00:03:46,803 --> 00:03:48,002
Not really.

39
00:03:48,004 --> 00:03:52,573
Well, I don't blame you.
It's pre-fab crap around here.

40
00:03:52,575 --> 00:03:56,410
You live around here?
Me? No, no, no, no.

41
00:03:56,412 --> 00:04:00,281
Is that your son?
Yeah.

42
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:02,817
You know, you look like a
man who needs some space.

43
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:06,387
You know, a place you can
really stretch your legs.

44
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:09,657
What if I told you
I had just the place?

45
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,025
I should have figured you were
trying to sell something.

46
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:14,528
You a realtor?
No, no, this is my place.

47
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,633
The open house is today.
70 acres.

48
00:04:18,635 --> 00:04:23,304
It's a real escape from the world.
70 acres?

49
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:25,673
That's a deal for 70 acres.
What's the catch?

50
00:04:25,675 --> 00:04:28,042
Oh, there's no strings attached.

51
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:31,345
You just have to really want it.

52
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:36,050
I'll hope to see you there.
Come on, Ollie.

53
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,628
So, Em, want to go
shopping tomorrow?

54
00:04:49,598 --> 00:04:53,034
We could, um, go to a movie.

55
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:55,036
What else could we do?

56
00:04:56,738 --> 00:05:00,875
I guess we could, um...
Who's that guy?

57
00:05:00,877 --> 00:05:02,576
Who?

58
00:05:07,616 --> 00:05:10,484
Did you see that?
Careful! Sorry, sir.

59
00:05:10,486 --> 00:05:13,821
Did you see that man?
What man?

60
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:15,723
Him?

61
00:05:15,725 --> 00:05:18,025
His face!
Shh!

62
00:05:22,831 --> 00:05:24,632
Great tour.

63
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:27,668
Yeah, we could do this today.
We'll give you a call.

64
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,437
There has been a lot of
interest in the place.

65
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,873
We'll give you a call.
Thank you.

66
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:37,611
Thank you.
It was great.

67
00:05:37,613 --> 00:05:39,513
You should've gone inside,
and the price is perfect.

68
00:05:39,515 --> 00:05:41,382
It's not right.

69
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:43,784
What's wrong with it?
You didn't even give it a chance.

70
00:05:43,786 --> 00:05:46,020
It had a pool.

71
00:05:46,022 --> 00:05:48,789
How long exactly do you
plan on staying with us?

72
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:51,592
Jesus, Don.
I am sorry to burden you.

73
00:05:51,594 --> 00:05:53,594
It's your fault
you're in that thing.

74
00:05:53,596 --> 00:05:56,030
It's yuppy-ville around here,
drives me crazy.

75
00:05:56,032 --> 00:05:58,432
Come on, let's take a
look at this place.

76
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:02,103
Where did you get that?
I want to go home!

77
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:05,673
It won't take long.
I'm telling you what I saw!

78
00:06:05,675 --> 00:06:07,541
Oh, my God.
I saw him, too.

79
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:10,811
There was nothing wrong with
him, except for the tacky hat.

80
00:06:10,813 --> 00:06:12,546
Dad, why won't you
listen to me?

81
00:06:12,548 --> 00:06:17,017
Please, Emmy, I understand you don't
want to be here, OK, but really!

82
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:20,521
This has nothing to do with her!
Her?

83
00:06:20,523 --> 00:06:24,458
Is that how I'm referred to now?
I'll refer to you any way I like!

84
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,093
Both of you, stop it!

85
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:30,564
Now we're going to go see this house,
and then we're going to go home.

86
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:32,967
And I don't want to hear any more
about it from either of you.

87
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:34,468
I don't want to hear a word!

88
00:06:56,057 --> 00:06:58,492
That's him, that's the
guy from the restaurant.

89
00:06:58,494 --> 00:07:00,060
Emmy!

90
00:07:02,063 --> 00:07:05,466
Come on.
Look at this place!

91
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:06,901
Huh?

92
00:07:19,448 --> 00:07:21,682
Well, it looks like we
missed the open house.

93
00:07:21,684 --> 00:07:24,718
Technically
it's still an open house.

94
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:31,992
Hello?

95
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:36,063
Hello?

96
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,104
Welcome to lot number 6485.

97
00:07:44,106 --> 00:07:48,609
Feel free to take a look around.
Press the buttons on the speakers...

98
00:07:48,611 --> 00:07:52,646
you see around the house to
hear about this great place!

99
00:07:52,648 --> 00:07:56,250
I think you'll like what you see.
People are so lazy nowadays.

100
00:07:56,252 --> 00:07:58,586
Well, we can go in.

101
00:08:09,764 --> 00:08:11,565
Who's this?

102
00:08:18,673 --> 00:08:20,107
This is more like it.

103
00:08:20,109 --> 00:08:22,009
Hi.

104
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:24,945
I take it you're not the realtor?
No.

105
00:08:24,947 --> 00:08:28,983
We're the Hayses.
I'm Charlie Hays.

106
00:08:28,985 --> 00:08:30,718
Don.

107
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,089
The door was wide open,
we just peeked in.

108
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:39,193
The number's on the sign,
we'll just get it.

109
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,565
I'm cold.
I'm gonna go sit in the car.

110
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,536
Bye.

111
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,906
He seems friendly.

112
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:56,611
He sees us as competition,
and well he should.

113
00:08:56,913 --> 00:08:58,145
For what?

114
00:08:58,147 --> 00:09:01,048
Oh, come on, this is pristine!

115
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,118
70 acres in the middle of nowhere.

116
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,853
That's my point.

117
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,902
The service out here sucks.
Dad!

118
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:29,910
Is everybody OK?
Yeah.

119
00:09:29,912 --> 00:09:31,879
Emmy?
I'm fine.

120
00:09:31,881 --> 00:09:35,816
You didn't hit her, did you?
No, he didn't hit her.

121
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:38,285
You didn't, did you?
No.

122
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,220
I don't think so.

123
00:09:47,662 --> 00:09:50,164
Hello?

124
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:53,667
Oh, my God.
Hello?

125
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:55,069
Would you help me, please?

126
00:09:56,872 --> 00:09:58,105
What's the matter?
Is somebody after you?

127
00:09:58,107 --> 00:10:00,608
I think she bit her tongue.

128
00:10:02,177 --> 00:10:04,278
Just keep her down.

129
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:17,124
Did you hit her?

130
00:10:17,126 --> 00:10:19,760
No, she ran out of the woods
in front of the car, we swerved.

131
00:10:19,762 --> 00:10:22,029
What's wrong with her mouth?
She bit her tongue.

132
00:10:22,031 --> 00:10:23,731
Fucking gross.

133
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:25,399
She's in shock.
How do you know?

134
00:10:25,401 --> 00:10:29,370
I'm a nurse.
She was running from someone.

135
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,241
Do you think this is
why the house is empty?

136
00:10:34,243 --> 00:10:37,044
What...
well, what do you mean?

137
00:10:41,116 --> 00:10:45,686
Let's get out of here,
let's get her to the hospital.

138
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:48,155
One, two, three.

139
00:10:52,327 --> 00:10:54,361
Hey! Hey!

140
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:57,765
Don! What are you doing?

141
00:11:03,838 --> 00:11:05,406
Could you turn the heat up, please?

142
00:11:05,408 --> 00:11:08,342
She's freezing.
Who do you think she is?

143
00:11:08,344 --> 00:11:09,877
Maybe a runaway?

144
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,845
Who cares?
I just want her out of my car.

145
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:15,249
How can you say that?
Easy. There's something off.

146
00:11:15,251 --> 00:11:18,152
Or am I the only one to see that?
No, Don, for God's sakes.

147
00:11:18,154 --> 00:11:20,287
You're not the only one who
sees that something's off.

148
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:23,290
OK, I'm sure there's a
reasonable explanation for this.

149
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:24,692
Sure there is.

150
00:11:24,694 --> 00:11:26,126
Does any of this
seem reasonable to you?

151
00:11:26,128 --> 00:11:28,996
Hey!
Why the hell did you turn around?

152
00:11:28,998 --> 00:11:30,364
I didn't.

153
00:11:30,366 --> 00:11:31,398
We must have turned around, right?

154
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,234
I didn't turn around.

155
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:37,071
Keep her quiet!

156
00:11:37,073 --> 00:11:40,474
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

157
00:11:48,817 --> 00:11:50,451
Did you see that?
What the fuck?

158
00:11:50,453 --> 00:11:52,152
It's OK.

159
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,902
What do you think?
Welcome to lot number 6485.

160
00:12:08,904 --> 00:12:13,040
Feel free to take a look around.
Press the buttons on the speakers...

161
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:17,311
you see around the house to
hear about this great place!

162
00:12:17,313 --> 00:12:19,980
I think you'll like what you see.

163
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:36,463
Would you slow down!
Dad, relax!

164
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:39,299
Yeah, take it easy, will you?
Don't tell me to take it easy!

165
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:40,868
What...
Don't!

166
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,036
Get out.
What do you want?

167
00:12:43,038 --> 00:12:45,172
Get out, Jason.
Ow!

168
00:12:45,174 --> 00:12:46,974
Get off her!

169
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:49,042
Tell me what's going on!
Get off her!

170
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:56,950
Oh, my God!
Her tongue is gone!

171
00:12:56,952 --> 00:12:59,319
This is fucked up!

172
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,155
I'm sorry.

173
00:13:50,271 --> 00:13:53,841
What's going on?

174
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,611
We're out of gas.

175
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,582
I'm gonna take a walk
through the woods.

176
00:14:01,584 --> 00:14:05,252
No, no, Don, please don't.
There's somebody out there.

177
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,323
Someone's bound to show
up in the morning.

178
00:14:09,325 --> 00:14:11,158
What do you mean, stay here?

179
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,428
I saw a fireplace and
firewood inside.

180
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,263
No, uh-uh, no,
I don't want to do that.

181
00:14:16,265 --> 00:14:17,931
That's a bad idea.

182
00:14:22,637 --> 00:14:25,439
Flashlights?
Give me some flashlights.

183
00:14:27,609 --> 00:14:30,911
Here.
It's OK.

184
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,147
She doesn't want to come inside.

185
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:36,116
She's got to come inside,
it's freezing out here.

186
00:14:36,118 --> 00:14:39,319
It's all right, it's all right,
we're not gonna hurt you.

187
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:43,290
She doesn't want to go.
She does... come on, you guys.

188
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:46,660
She doesn't want to...
Dad, please don't.

189
00:14:46,662 --> 00:14:50,964
We all have to stay together.
She doesn't want to come inside!

190
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:53,667
We got to get her...
Stop it, stop it!

191
00:14:56,204 --> 00:14:59,139
What is the matter with you? Do you
want to spend the night in the car?

192
00:15:01,676 --> 00:15:03,677
Charlie!

193
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:17,190
No...

194
00:15:28,202 --> 00:15:32,706
Let's get her upstairs into one of
the beds in the upstairs bedrooms.

195
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,075
All right, let's go, come on.

196
00:15:35,077 --> 00:15:36,997
What's wrong with her?
What's she looking at?

197
00:15:39,348 --> 00:15:42,182
Try to put her on one of
the sofas in the den.

198
00:15:46,956 --> 00:15:50,958
All right, all right.

199
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,228
I'll get a... I'll get a blanket
from one of the bedrooms.

200
00:16:22,623 --> 00:16:25,058
Thinking about starting a family?

201
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,562
There's plenty of room for
your little bundle of joy here!

202
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,211
Leslie?
Thank you.

203
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:23,283
She has a fever.

204
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:32,459
We tried to leave 23 times.

205
00:17:32,461 --> 00:17:34,394
Was it that many?

206
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:42,069
Do you think she was trying
to leave and couldn't?

207
00:17:42,071 --> 00:17:44,204
I don't know.

208
00:17:44,206 --> 00:17:47,340
Would you please be quiet?

209
00:17:47,342 --> 00:17:50,243
I can say whatever I want.

210
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:55,482
I can't be stuck here!

211
00:17:55,484 --> 00:17:58,685
I don't think any of us
want to be stuck here.

212
00:17:58,687 --> 00:18:03,156
We need to be patient,
because someone is gonna come.

213
00:18:03,158 --> 00:18:06,226
Some of us have a life, OK?

214
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,198
We do!

215
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:15,335
Oh, Jesus.

216
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:42,662
I got to get some wood.

217
00:20:09,784 --> 00:20:11,918
Was that just sitting there?

218
00:20:13,788 --> 00:20:15,422
Yeah.

219
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,321
I was rude.

220
00:20:50,324 --> 00:20:52,993
It's just that...

221
00:20:52,995 --> 00:20:56,796
I start a new shift on Monday.

222
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:59,633
We can't be stuck here.
Right?

223
00:21:01,002 --> 00:21:03,270
I hope not.

224
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,408
What do you do?

225
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,712
I was a third grade teacher...
before kids.

226
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:18,885
Is he your only one?
He is now.

227
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:26,326
Someone was here today.

228
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:29,996
There's fresh shaving
cream upstairs.

229
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:32,499
Look at this.

230
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:35,402
Seven cans.
Just enough.

231
00:21:35,404 --> 00:21:39,673
Wow.
That's wonderfully creepy.

232
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,024
Gross.

233
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:13,340
Your mother's really scared.

234
00:22:13,342 --> 00:22:15,575
She's not my mom.

235
00:22:15,577 --> 00:22:17,844
You don't like her.
I can tell.

236
00:22:17,846 --> 00:22:19,813
Jason.
I'm sorry, hon.

237
00:22:19,815 --> 00:22:24,084
No, no, it's fine.
I don't like her.

238
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:35,528
So, uh, where's your mom?

239
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:44,738
Hello!
Shut up, Jason.

240
00:22:48,008 --> 00:22:52,579
So how'd you break your leg?
Car crash.

241
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:54,848
Yeah?
Yeah.

242
00:22:57,852 --> 00:23:01,054
Didn't get a ticket, though.

243
00:23:01,056 --> 00:23:04,424
I was able to drive home,
even with a broken leg.

244
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:06,559
Lucky you.

245
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:23,009
I'll take the first watch.
Wake you in a few hours.

246
00:23:23,011 --> 00:23:25,445
Want to sleep next to me?

247
00:23:27,515 --> 00:23:30,183
I was just messing around.

248
00:23:39,727 --> 00:23:42,662
Welcome to lot number 6485.

249
00:23:42,664 --> 00:23:46,766
Feel free to take a look around.
Press the buttons on the speakers...

250
00:23:46,768 --> 00:23:51,070
you see around the house to
hear about this great place!

251
00:23:51,072 --> 00:23:55,809
I think you'll like what you see!
Welcome to lot number 6485.

252
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:59,946
Feel free to take a look around.
Press the buttons on the speakers...

253
00:23:59,948 --> 00:24:02,816
Turn that shit off!

254
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:05,485
Feel free to take a look around.
I think you'll like what you see.

255
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:08,455
Press the buttons on the speakers
you see around the house...

256
00:24:08,457 --> 00:24:11,558
Where's the girl?
Welcome to lot number 6485.

257
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,527
I think you'll like what you see.
Feel free to take a look around.

258
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:21,601
If the girl goes outside, she could die.
Son of a bitch, that's him!

259
00:24:25,473 --> 00:24:26,940
Don't go out there!
What if he's chasing after her?

260
00:24:26,942 --> 00:24:30,477
Then we need to have a talk.
Don, stop it! Don't go out!

261
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:31,911
Stubborn!

262
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:43,790
Hey!

263
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:45,091
Stop!

264
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:51,231
Shit!
Where did they go?

265
00:24:51,233 --> 00:24:52,832
Dad!

266
00:24:52,834 --> 00:24:54,667
Get back to the house!
Get back to the house!

267
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:56,870
That's him, that's they
guy from the restaurant!

268
00:24:56,872 --> 00:25:00,073
I met that guy.
He told me about this place.

269
00:25:00,075 --> 00:25:01,774
Let's get back to the house.
Come on.

270
00:25:01,776 --> 00:25:04,644
I'm going to try and walk to the road.
But that thing is out there!

271
00:25:04,646 --> 00:25:08,214
Come on, come on, it'll be... it'll be OK.
Get back, get back to the house.

272
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:13,586
You bitch!
What are you doing?

273
00:25:13,588 --> 00:25:15,188
You have no idea what
the fuck she's doing!

274
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:18,091
Wait till you see what I found!

275
00:25:24,164 --> 00:25:25,765
Come with me.

276
00:25:33,607 --> 00:25:35,608
Check it out, it's still warm.

277
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:38,678
Oh, what?
You think she did this?

278
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,680
Wait, check this out, come on.

279
00:25:44,018 --> 00:25:47,320
Look.
She must have done it.

280
00:25:50,858 --> 00:25:52,091
Why do you say that?

281
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:56,229
She was the only one gone!

282
00:25:56,231 --> 00:25:58,665
She just had her tongue cut out.

283
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:02,201
I doubt that she's stacking
cans in the pantry.

284
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:07,206
I'm just saying.

285
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:09,309
I'm gonna go start a fire.

286
00:26:12,046 --> 00:26:14,781
<i>♪ She said, Charlie, my dear... ♪</i>

287
00:26:21,889 --> 00:26:26,359
Jason, find a station
and leave it there, OK?

288
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:28,161
What are you doing?

289
00:26:28,163 --> 00:26:31,030
I just figured
if we're gonna be here...

290
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,275
I think the phone service
must be cut at the pole.

291
00:26:42,277 --> 00:26:46,646
The water heater's busted.
I couldn't get the heater to work,

292
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:51,284
but we've got plenty of firewood,
so we won't freeze to death.

293
00:26:51,286 --> 00:26:52,619
Anything from the girl?

294
00:26:52,621 --> 00:26:54,220
No.

295
00:26:54,222 --> 00:26:55,922
Is she eating?

296
00:27:02,163 --> 00:27:06,265
Psst! Hey! Turn that thing off!
Turn it off!

297
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,682
Bring him in, he's frozen!

298
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,054
Sit down. Come by the fire.
Come on, come on.

299
00:27:28,056 --> 00:27:29,088
You OK?

300
00:27:30,792 --> 00:27:32,158
Get a blanket.

301
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:35,962
Did you find someone?

302
00:27:35,964 --> 00:27:40,700
I could hear cars going
by just over the hill.

303
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:42,335
So they're coming to get us?

304
00:27:42,337 --> 00:27:46,272
They were always just...
over the hill.

305
00:27:46,274 --> 00:27:47,774
What do you mean?

306
00:27:47,776 --> 00:27:52,579
I mean, every time
I went across the hill,

307
00:27:52,781 --> 00:27:57,150
they were just over the next fucking hill!
So you didn't even get to the road?

308
00:27:57,152 --> 00:28:01,020
Jason, what are you missing
in "just over the next hill?"

309
00:28:01,022 --> 00:28:02,889
I walked around for I don't
know how many hours,

310
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:07,293
and every time I looked around,
there was the house.

311
00:28:07,295 --> 00:28:08,728
This house!

312
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,999
I'm sorry.
I cannot get stuck here!

313
00:28:13,001 --> 00:28:16,169
Shut up.
Excuse me?

314
00:28:16,171 --> 00:28:19,739
Shut up.
The girl knows.

315
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:24,110
We all stay here
until someone comes.

316
00:28:24,112 --> 00:28:25,778
OK?

317
00:29:17,531 --> 00:29:20,366
Welcome to lot number 6485.

318
00:29:20,368 --> 00:29:24,470
Feel free to take a look around.
Press the buttons on the speakers

319
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:28,975
you see around the house to
hear about this great place!

320
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:31,277
I think you'll like what you see.

321
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,569
Do you want me to wash it?

322
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:04,143
No, it'll work...

323
00:30:04,145 --> 00:30:06,546
for one more day.

324
00:30:06,548 --> 00:30:09,348
Did you sleep last night?

325
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:12,118
No.

326
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,153
Not at all?

327
00:30:14,155 --> 00:30:15,488
Mm-mm.

328
00:30:21,094 --> 00:30:23,162
How was your night?

329
00:30:23,164 --> 00:30:24,497
Are you serious?

330
00:30:24,499 --> 00:30:27,166
Yes, I...

331
00:30:27,168 --> 00:30:29,836
Fine, thank you.

332
00:30:38,512 --> 00:30:42,148
Are you coming downstairs?
No.

333
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,483
Do you want me to stay here?

334
00:30:47,354 --> 00:30:49,388
What?

335
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:53,226
I just can't help thinking...

336
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:56,395
I wasn't even supposed to be here.

337
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:58,331
Why's that?

338
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:02,902
Charlie, I told you I didn't
want to go looking at houses.

339
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:04,871
With Emmy, you mean.

340
00:31:04,873 --> 00:31:08,341
No. No, I mean...

341
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,043
I want to get the kindling today.

342
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:55,448
You get to go outside.

343
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,149
I'll go with her.

344
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:01,320
Take this.

345
00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:08,160
Well, don't... don't go far.

346
00:33:18,338 --> 00:33:20,139
No one's coming.

347
00:33:23,643 --> 00:33:25,745
You want to go out there again?

348
00:33:28,482 --> 00:33:31,617
Don't know what else
we can do but try.

349
00:33:35,756 --> 00:33:38,124
At least that thing
hasn't been back.

350
00:33:38,126 --> 00:33:41,627
Only one lucky family will
call this house their home.

351
00:33:41,629 --> 00:33:44,630
Will it be your family?

352
00:33:44,632 --> 00:33:47,533
But it is watching.

353
00:33:47,535 --> 00:33:49,402
I get that much.

354
00:34:03,383 --> 00:34:07,520
You're almost walking normal.
I only need the brace for a week more.

355
00:34:19,332 --> 00:34:21,067
Can I kiss you?

356
00:34:24,171 --> 00:34:25,571
You remind me of my ex.

357
00:34:38,852 --> 00:34:40,619
More photographs.

358
00:34:42,189 --> 00:34:46,792
Your name is on these.
It's from the bank.

359
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:48,627
Foreclosure agreement.

360
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,565
Is that why we're here?

361
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:55,868
Because you foreclosed
on these people's house?

362
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:13,352
There's a boy in the window.
Mm-hmm.

363
00:35:13,354 --> 00:35:16,122
I'm serious!
Yeah, uh-huh.

364
00:35:20,794 --> 00:35:23,629
We must have evicted them.

365
00:35:24,865 --> 00:35:26,332
Oh.

366
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:29,869
What's wrong?
There's someone in the house.

367
00:35:29,871 --> 00:35:32,872
Who? Who?
I saw a little boy in that window.

368
00:35:35,408 --> 00:35:38,444
This is him, this is
the boy that I saw.

369
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:07,740
What is it?

370
00:36:11,344 --> 00:36:13,579
Not a sane one in this house.

371
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:20,653
He was standing right there.

372
00:36:20,655 --> 00:36:23,289
You sure you saw someone?

373
00:36:51,484 --> 00:36:52,952
Mommy?

374
00:36:54,955 --> 00:36:56,689
Mommy?

375
00:37:01,695 --> 00:37:03,362
Lizzy.

376
00:37:04,564 --> 00:37:07,499
Baby, what are you doing here?

377
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:10,269
I came to see you, Mommy.

378
00:37:12,572 --> 00:37:14,106
Baby.

379
00:37:14,508 --> 00:37:16,809
I miss you so much.

380
00:37:18,678 --> 00:37:20,946
Oh, look at that.

381
00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:24,717
We never could get that hair
to stay in place, could we?

382
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:28,254
Let's fix that. OK.
Let's put that up.

383
00:37:28,256 --> 00:37:31,323
Look at your sweet little face.

384
00:37:33,526 --> 00:37:34,893
There.

385
00:37:36,696 --> 00:37:41,300
There! Look at that!
I can't stay.

386
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:44,303
Oh, no, please don't go.
Don't go now.

387
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:46,805
Please don't leave Mommy.
Stay with me.

388
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:49,008
Please stay with Mommy.

389
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,454
What about everybody else?

390
00:38:04,391 --> 00:38:05,691
I can't.

391
00:38:06,726 --> 00:38:08,594
I can't.

392
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:12,898
I love you so much.

393
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,000
I love you, too, Mommy.

394
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,873
I'm gonna get sick if I eat
any more of this shit.

395
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:32,611
Honey, please don't ruin dinner.
But it's not dinner. It's crap.

396
00:39:32,613 --> 00:39:35,447
Don't talk to your mother that way.

397
00:39:35,449 --> 00:39:37,950
At least we have something.

398
00:39:40,387 --> 00:39:41,887
What?

399
00:39:47,127 --> 00:39:49,561
Do you like being here?

400
00:39:51,698 --> 00:39:56,034
It's just... it seems like it.

401
00:39:56,036 --> 00:40:00,806
You know, you're always cleaning
and straightening and...

402
00:40:00,808 --> 00:40:02,641
It's not making
a bit of difference.

403
00:40:02,643 --> 00:40:07,646
How is that any different than
out there in the real world?

404
00:40:07,648 --> 00:40:11,083
Oh, I think
it's very goddamn different.

405
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:18,891
Sorry.

406
00:40:18,893 --> 00:40:23,829
Let's just all take a breath, OK?

407
00:40:25,832 --> 00:40:27,499
No.

408
00:40:29,702 --> 00:40:31,870
You know something.

409
00:40:35,074 --> 00:40:39,511
It is not my fault that
you can't handle this.

410
00:40:41,714 --> 00:40:43,749
You know what I can't handle?

411
00:40:43,751 --> 00:40:47,686
I can't handle
your demure attitude.

412
00:40:47,688 --> 00:40:50,923
You know what that means?

413
00:40:50,925 --> 00:40:52,791
Or did you not teach that
to your third graders?

414
00:40:52,793 --> 00:40:55,994
Susan...
Please.

415
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:59,932
It's OK.
She can't help herself.

416
00:40:59,934 --> 00:41:00,999
Oh, please.

417
00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:07,706
Do you think you're the only
person who's ever lost someone?

418
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:09,775
Huh?

419
00:41:09,777 --> 00:41:12,544
The rest of us just
haven't given up!

420
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:31,763
You all just keep pushing.

421
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:48,113
I'm not the enemy.

422
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:56,788
We could have saved her.

423
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:59,725
We did everything we could.
Please...

424
00:41:59,727 --> 00:42:03,228
No, just get away from me.
Just get away from me.

425
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:07,032
Get away from me!

426
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,730
Baby.

427
00:42:45,672 --> 00:42:46,939
Yeah.

428
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:51,310
OK.
OK.

429
00:42:56,649 --> 00:43:01,720
On the speakers you see around the
house to hear about this great place!

430
00:43:01,722 --> 00:43:03,755
I think you'll like what you see.

431
00:43:03,757 --> 00:43:06,825
It takes a family to
make a house a home.

432
00:43:10,998 --> 00:43:15,100
<i>♪ I'm crazy about you</i>

433
00:43:15,102 --> 00:43:17,803
<i>♪ Without you</i>

434
00:43:17,805 --> 00:43:21,707
<i>♪ For you I'm strong</i>

435
00:43:21,709 --> 00:43:24,343
<i>♪ I can't do without you</i>

436
00:43:24,345 --> 00:43:26,979
<i>♪ Howcha magowcha</i>

437
00:43:26,981 --> 00:43:30,115
<i>♪ Don't stay too long</i>

438
00:44:06,819 --> 00:44:09,087
Charlie! Charlie!

439
00:44:11,958 --> 00:44:15,861
You would never do that.
Right?

440
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:22,868
Do what?
Would you?

441
00:45:08,848 --> 00:45:12,484
I went into a house,
and it wasn't a house.

442
00:45:12,486 --> 00:45:17,189
It has big steps
and a great, big hall.

443
00:45:17,191 --> 00:45:22,394
But it hasn't got a garden,
a garden, a garden.

444
00:45:22,396 --> 00:45:25,297
It isn't like a house at all.

445
00:45:30,303 --> 00:45:33,138
How do we get out of here?

446
00:45:41,981 --> 00:45:44,750
What did she say? Huh?

447
00:45:44,752 --> 00:45:48,353
What is that?
What do you know?

448
00:45:51,257 --> 00:45:53,225
How did you get here?

449
00:45:56,262 --> 00:45:59,498
Did you come to look at the house?

450
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:03,435
Yeah.
Did you come alone?

451
00:46:20,219 --> 00:46:22,087
What does it want?

452
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:26,391
The house?

453
00:46:28,027 --> 00:46:31,096
Then why the hell
did it give me the flyer?

454
00:46:31,098 --> 00:46:33,498
You want it, take it!
You hear me?

455
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,535
You want the whole place, take it!

456
00:46:39,305 --> 00:46:41,540
Where's your mother?
I don't know.

457
00:46:41,542 --> 00:46:44,509
I'll find her.
You get our cans of food.

458
00:46:44,511 --> 00:46:46,545
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
what are you doing?

459
00:46:46,547 --> 00:46:48,280
Remember what that thing said?

460
00:46:48,282 --> 00:46:51,149
Only one family can have
this house. We're leaving.

461
00:46:51,151 --> 00:46:53,585
Well, then we're going with you.
No, you're not.

462
00:46:53,587 --> 00:46:56,588
You're staying with her.
You're not leaving us here unarmed!

463
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:58,423
I saw the eviction notice!

464
00:46:58,425 --> 00:47:01,259
Whoever you kicked out
of here wants you!

465
00:47:01,261 --> 00:47:05,096
You're staying.
Leslie! Leslie!

466
00:47:05,098 --> 00:47:07,499
There are only six cans.

467
00:47:12,939 --> 00:47:15,574
Who took the can?
I don't know.

468
00:47:15,576 --> 00:47:18,944
Look, we stand a better chance
if we all stick together.

469
00:47:18,946 --> 00:47:21,179
Oh, yeah?
How do you know that?

470
00:47:21,181 --> 00:47:22,480
And why should I trust you?

471
00:47:22,482 --> 00:47:24,950
For all I know, you took the can!
You're being ridiculous.

472
00:47:24,952 --> 00:47:28,119
Leslie, come on!
We're going with you.

473
00:47:28,121 --> 00:47:33,291
No, you are not.
Come on, Mom! Let's go!

474
00:47:34,527 --> 00:47:36,228
Leslie?

475
00:47:45,972 --> 00:47:47,572
Mom?

476
00:48:05,892 --> 00:48:09,661
No! No! No!
No, no, no.

477
00:48:11,063 --> 00:48:13,999
Get a knife!
OK.

478
00:48:23,643 --> 00:48:26,411
No, baby, no.
No, no, no.

479
00:48:28,481 --> 00:48:31,249
Just let me check her,
just let me check her, please.

480
00:48:39,558 --> 00:48:43,094
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be all right.

481
00:48:45,197 --> 00:48:47,399
She did this hours ago.

482
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:52,470
You caused this.

483
00:48:52,472 --> 00:48:55,507
What?
Me?

484
00:48:55,509 --> 00:48:58,176
Yeah. You had to keep
pushing her, didn't you?

485
00:48:58,178 --> 00:49:00,712
Didn't you?
Stop it!

486
00:49:07,553 --> 00:49:10,355
Keep pushing me, Charlie,
I dare you.

487
00:49:10,357 --> 00:49:11,990
Huh?

488
00:49:17,263 --> 00:49:19,230
Oh, baby...

489
00:50:12,585 --> 00:50:15,220
I guess she couldn't handle it.

490
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:00,565
Dad?

491
00:51:04,703 --> 00:51:07,472
Your neck.
Huh?

492
00:51:12,545 --> 00:51:15,113
You hanging in there, kiddo?

493
00:51:15,115 --> 00:51:20,752
Yeah.
I was thinking about Mom.

494
00:51:24,156 --> 00:51:27,358
I was thinking about the
time we went to the beach.

495
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:31,729
I remember how much you
two were fighting.

496
00:51:31,731 --> 00:51:34,132
Married people fight.

497
00:51:34,734 --> 00:51:37,702
Were you guys
going to get a divorce?

498
00:51:40,372 --> 00:51:43,541
Is this about Susan?
No.

499
00:51:43,543 --> 00:51:48,379
Well, then why do you ask?
It just seemed that way.

500
00:51:48,381 --> 00:51:53,184
Why does it matter now?
I just want to know.

501
00:51:54,787 --> 00:51:58,223
She was seeing someone else.

502
00:51:58,225 --> 00:52:00,592
So she was going to leave us?

503
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:06,631
I guess so.
I don't understand.

504
00:52:06,633 --> 00:52:08,566
Why would she do
something like that?

505
00:52:08,568 --> 00:52:10,535
I don't know.

506
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:29,721
Welcome to lot number 6485.
Feel free to take a look around.

507
00:52:29,723 --> 00:52:33,625
Press the buttons on the speakers you
see around the house to hear about...

508
00:52:33,627 --> 00:52:37,529
Welcome to lot number 6485.
I think you'll like what you...

509
00:52:37,531 --> 00:52:40,832
feel free to take a look around.
Press the buttons on the speakers

510
00:52:40,834 --> 00:52:44,369
you see around the house
to hear about this...

511
00:52:45,738 --> 00:52:48,606
I'm sorry.

512
00:52:48,608 --> 00:52:52,577
It's for the best.
You can see her now.

513
00:52:57,283 --> 00:52:58,716
I'm sorry.

514
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,821
It's for the best.

515
00:53:07,826 --> 00:53:09,727
You can see her now.

516
00:53:11,931 --> 00:53:14,265
You can see her now.

517
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:39,924
You OK?

518
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,861
I saw him.

519
00:53:48,234 --> 00:53:52,637
Who?
The man with the white face.

520
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:57,642
He shot himself.
He shot the little boy.

521
00:53:59,645 --> 00:54:01,446
There's nothing in there.

522
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:06,284
Nothing in there is real.

523
00:54:06,286 --> 00:54:08,453
You're gonna be OK.

524
00:54:11,023 --> 00:54:14,559
Come on, I'd never let
anything happen to you, OK?

525
00:54:14,561 --> 00:54:17,362
Never let anything happen to you.

526
00:54:24,703 --> 00:54:28,439
Shit!
Shit!

527
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:21,512
Help me.

528
00:58:08,927 --> 00:58:12,196
I'm glad you're fucking dead!

529
00:58:12,198 --> 00:58:15,700
Show me what you want!
I don't care!

530
00:58:15,702 --> 00:58:19,237
I don't care!
I don't care what you show me!

531
00:58:19,239 --> 00:58:21,906
She deserved to die!

532
00:58:32,684 --> 00:58:34,118
Hey!

533
00:59:10,822 --> 00:59:14,826
I went to a house,
but it wasn't a house.

534
00:59:15,328 --> 00:59:19,464
It has big steps and
a great, big hall.

535
00:59:20,066 --> 00:59:25,169
But it has not a garden,
a garden, a garden.

536
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:03,341
Hello?

537
01:00:06,745 --> 01:00:09,213
What are you doing here?

538
01:00:09,215 --> 01:00:12,049
Same thing you're doing here.

539
01:00:14,186 --> 01:00:16,320
I know you're out.

540
01:00:21,994 --> 01:00:23,928
Take a load off.

541
01:00:34,373 --> 01:00:36,073
Miss her, huh?

542
01:00:37,743 --> 01:00:40,378
I didn't see it coming, you know?

543
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:43,147
She's always been so...
Stable?

544
01:00:43,149 --> 01:00:46,050
And sweet.

545
01:00:46,052 --> 01:00:49,353
The first time I shot a
deer and brought it home,

546
01:00:49,355 --> 01:00:51,656
she actually cried.

547
01:00:53,158 --> 01:00:55,660
She hated when I would hunt.

548
01:00:55,662 --> 01:00:59,030
She did like venison, though.

549
01:00:59,032 --> 01:01:01,165
She was a good cook.

550
01:01:04,236 --> 01:01:07,204
I can't remember the last
time I told her that.

551
01:01:07,206 --> 01:01:09,874
Hell of a situation you're in, huh?

552
01:01:09,876 --> 01:01:11,776
Don't you mean that we're in?

553
01:01:11,778 --> 01:01:15,312
You're on your own on this one.

554
01:01:15,314 --> 01:01:17,948
If it wasn't for that bitch.

555
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:21,052
How dare she bring up our daughter.

556
01:01:21,054 --> 01:01:24,455
I can tell you're not putting
two and two together.

557
01:01:24,457 --> 01:01:26,891
What do you mean?

558
01:01:26,893 --> 01:01:30,261
I think Susan knew
what she was doing.

559
01:01:30,263 --> 01:01:35,166
She just picked at her and
she couldn't take it, and...

560
01:01:35,168 --> 01:01:38,836
Why do you think she would do that?

561
01:01:38,838 --> 01:01:42,006
If I knew, you'd know.

562
01:01:42,008 --> 01:01:43,908
I've got a hunch, though.

563
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:47,044
You want to hear it?
Uh-huh.

564
01:01:47,046 --> 01:01:52,316
I think they know what they're doing.
What do you mean?

565
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:55,820
You heard what the house said...
us or them.

566
01:01:55,822 --> 01:01:59,890
And they're playing dirty.
It's just a hunch, though.

567
01:01:59,892 --> 01:02:02,226
So...

568
01:02:02,228 --> 01:02:04,795
They're in it to win it, huh?

569
01:02:07,866 --> 01:02:10,835
Hello?
How's it going?

570
01:02:10,837 --> 01:02:12,403
Man, I'll tell you,
it's been a little rough.

571
01:02:12,405 --> 01:02:14,839
The whole family's had the flu.

572
01:02:17,075 --> 01:02:19,143
Hello?!

573
01:02:24,983 --> 01:02:27,151
I just shaved.
Nice, huh?

574
01:02:29,521 --> 01:02:33,124
Did you hear anyone?
No.

575
01:02:33,126 --> 01:02:37,294
Look, I didn't mean to come
across so pushy before.

576
01:02:37,296 --> 01:02:39,396
I'm sure you have someone you miss.

577
01:02:39,398 --> 01:02:43,868
I heard cars and people talking.
Do you have a boyfriend?

578
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:46,871
Huh?
A boyfriend?

579
01:02:46,873 --> 01:02:50,107
Do you have one?
No.

580
01:02:51,943 --> 01:02:55,513
I know I'm a little older,
but what does that matter?

581
01:02:55,515 --> 01:02:58,282
I'm gonna go warm up.
I'll keep you warm.

582
01:02:58,284 --> 01:03:00,384
I want to go back to the house.

583
01:03:00,386 --> 01:03:02,353
You're not even giving it a chance!

584
01:03:02,355 --> 01:03:04,855
I'm going back to the house.

585
01:03:06,458 --> 01:03:08,526
Well, if you guys want to go...
Do you hear that?

586
01:03:08,528 --> 01:03:10,394
What?

587
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:20,871
All I wanted was a kiss!
One kiss!

588
01:03:20,873 --> 01:03:22,406
But you had to be such a prude!

589
01:03:23,942 --> 01:03:26,377
You never know what other
people are capable of.

590
01:03:26,379 --> 01:03:28,445
But, then again,

591
01:03:28,447 --> 01:03:31,482
you never quite know what
you're capable of, either.

592
01:03:33,084 --> 01:03:34,485
Hey.

593
01:03:39,925 --> 01:03:42,493
The more you struggle,
the longer this will take.

594
01:03:58,977 --> 01:04:02,513
What the fuck are you waiting for?
Go get some help!

595
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:26,537
Oh, my God. Jason, what the...
What the hell happened?

596
01:04:28,139 --> 01:04:32,343
That fucking mute bitch
hit me with a log!

597
01:04:32,345 --> 01:04:35,646
Why did she hit you?
I don't know, ow!

598
01:04:35,648 --> 01:04:40,517
It caught you good, man.
What were you doing out here?

599
01:04:40,519 --> 01:04:43,220
I was following the girl!
The mute girl?

600
01:04:43,222 --> 01:04:47,958
No! The girl! Emmy!
What was she doing out here?

601
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:51,061
Trying to leave, I think.
She was trying to leave?

602
01:04:51,063 --> 01:04:52,496
Maybe, fuck, who cares?
Get this out of me!

603
01:04:52,498 --> 01:04:54,398
All right, all right, all right.

604
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,942
Don.
Yeah?

605
01:05:04,944 --> 01:05:08,279
Why don't you let Susan
take a look at him?

606
01:05:08,281 --> 01:05:12,249
Should I let her
take a look at him, Chuck?

607
01:05:12,251 --> 01:05:16,053
So she can "take care of him," huh?

608
01:05:16,055 --> 01:05:21,458
We're just trying to help.
Like you helped Leslie?

609
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,560
What are you talking about?

610
01:05:25,497 --> 01:05:30,534
You're just gonna pick us off, one by
one, until you can leave, that the plan?

611
01:05:30,536 --> 01:05:33,304
Of course not.

612
01:05:33,306 --> 01:05:36,307
It's you or us.

613
01:05:37,009 --> 01:05:38,642
Isn't that right?

614
01:05:41,313 --> 01:05:44,148
So you're with them, too, huh?

615
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:46,417
She only hit him because
he tried to rape me.

616
01:05:46,419 --> 01:05:47,985
That's bullshit!

617
01:05:47,987 --> 01:05:50,187
Alright, don't.
Ow!

618
01:05:53,458 --> 01:05:55,192
I'm gonna get you off that thing.

619
01:05:55,194 --> 01:05:57,561
You can't just pull it out, Don,
he could bleed to death.

620
01:05:57,563 --> 01:06:01,565
Shut up.
Look at me in the eye.

621
01:06:01,567 --> 01:06:05,436
I'm gonna count to three.
Give me your hands.

622
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:08,672
One...

623
01:06:13,311 --> 01:06:14,378
Two...

624
01:06:25,724 --> 01:06:30,327
Put some wood on the fire.
OK, look at his wound.

625
01:06:30,329 --> 01:06:33,464
Let's just take it easy
with the orders, Don, OK?

626
01:06:33,466 --> 01:06:37,301
Or what, Chuck? Huh?

627
01:06:37,303 --> 01:06:39,003
There's some gauze
and alcohol upstairs.

628
01:06:39,005 --> 01:06:42,539
Someone get it, please.
I'll get it.

629
01:06:46,778 --> 01:06:50,180
You can see it, right?
What does it look like?

630
01:06:50,182 --> 01:06:53,484
It didn't hit any major organs.
It needs to be stitched,

631
01:06:53,486 --> 01:06:56,353
and he should be given antibiotics.
So where do we find those, huh?

632
01:06:56,355 --> 01:07:02,092
I know that. I'm just saying, OK?
But he's gonna be OK?

633
01:07:02,094 --> 01:07:05,596
It depends on how much blood he's
lost, and if it gets infected.

634
01:07:05,598 --> 01:07:08,098
I'm right fucking here!

635
01:07:09,367 --> 01:07:12,403
If he dies, you die.

636
01:07:22,247 --> 01:07:24,381
This is gonna hurt.

637
01:07:44,803 --> 01:07:47,271
House meeting in the den.

638
01:07:50,508 --> 01:07:51,842
Now.

639
01:07:53,478 --> 01:07:55,512
Come on, baby.

640
01:08:16,501 --> 01:08:20,370
As we can all agree, I think
this situation has really...

641
01:08:21,606 --> 01:08:25,375
gone off the rails.
I'm not the bad guy.

642
01:08:25,377 --> 01:08:29,146
I just want to get out of here
in one piece, that's all.

643
01:08:29,148 --> 01:08:33,283
So what can we do
to make that happen?

644
01:08:34,686 --> 01:08:37,588
Emmy, what were you
doing out in the woods?

645
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:41,692
First I want to know why your
son attacked my daughter.

646
01:08:41,694 --> 01:08:45,395
Look, Charlie, whatever
happened, it's done.

647
01:08:45,397 --> 01:08:48,499
I think we'll all agree that we need to
figure out a way to get out of here.

648
01:08:48,501 --> 01:08:51,702
Don't you say a word.
Fine, Chuck.

649
01:08:51,704 --> 01:08:55,539
Jason, why did you attack his daughter?
And don't lie to me.

650
01:08:56,875 --> 01:08:58,876
She was walking backwards.

651
01:09:00,345 --> 01:09:02,713
She kept falling.

652
01:09:02,715 --> 01:09:05,415
She fell and I caught her.

653
01:09:05,417 --> 01:09:10,187
She pushed me off, and then that
girl hit me with a fucking log.

654
01:09:12,257 --> 01:09:14,424
You were walking backwards?

655
01:09:15,727 --> 01:09:17,594
Yeah.

656
01:09:17,596 --> 01:09:19,429
And I must have made it
to the road,

657
01:09:19,431 --> 01:09:24,201
because two cars were stopped,
and I heard people talking.

658
01:09:24,203 --> 01:09:25,836
You heard people talking?
No one was talking.

659
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:28,872
Yes, there were, and after you
attacked me, they were gone.

660
01:09:28,874 --> 01:09:31,408
I didn't attack you!
Enough!

661
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:35,679
OK.

662
01:09:37,348 --> 01:09:39,683
Nobody goes back into
those woods except me.

663
01:09:39,685 --> 01:09:41,351
Oh, you're keeping us
hostage here now?

664
01:09:41,353 --> 01:09:44,621
We're all being kept hostage.
What about him?

665
01:09:47,525 --> 01:09:49,826
If this thing only wants
one of our families,

666
01:09:49,828 --> 01:09:53,697
then understand this,
it won't be us.

667
01:10:15,787 --> 01:10:17,521
Mom!

668
01:10:58,863 --> 01:11:01,431
If you help me up, I can go.

669
01:11:04,535 --> 01:11:06,737
I hate leaving you with them.

670
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,807
I don't trust 'em.

671
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:27,691
That should last.

672
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:33,897
What if something happens to
you when you're out there?

673
01:11:33,899 --> 01:11:36,533
What then?

674
01:11:36,535 --> 01:11:39,036
Nice try, Chuck.

675
01:11:39,038 --> 01:11:43,940
Your son's wounds need to be cleaned.
I know that he needs help,

676
01:11:43,942 --> 01:11:48,479
but I'm not going to have you running
around after what you did to him.

677
01:11:48,981 --> 01:11:50,614
Jason.

678
01:11:50,616 --> 01:11:53,483
I will be back for you.

679
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:25,816
Take it easy.

680
01:12:25,818 --> 01:12:29,519
Everybody, just take it easy,
we're gonna get out of this.

681
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:39,529
You know I'm getting
out of here, right?

682
01:12:39,531 --> 01:12:42,099
What makes you so sure any of us
are getting out of here, huh?

683
01:12:42,101 --> 01:12:47,404
Well, I don't know if we're getting
out of here, but I know you're not.

684
01:12:56,047 --> 01:13:00,016
It's a shame to leave a sweet
piece of ass like you here.

685
01:13:00,018 --> 01:13:01,985
You know why you're shivering?

686
01:13:01,987 --> 01:13:05,589
Because your body's lost so much blood
it can't keep itself warm, asshole.

687
01:13:05,591 --> 01:13:07,057
Shut up, bitch!

688
01:13:10,061 --> 01:13:12,396
You're in mild shock by now, too.

689
01:13:12,398 --> 01:13:13,964
I said shut up!

690
01:13:13,966 --> 01:13:17,667
What did you see out there, Jason?
I saw you in the field.

691
01:13:17,669 --> 01:13:20,971
You said she deserved to die.
Who deserved to die?

692
01:13:20,973 --> 01:13:22,773
Shut up!

693
01:13:32,083 --> 01:13:36,686
What's happening?
He's having a seizure.

694
01:13:43,495 --> 01:13:45,162
We have to get that!

695
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:49,733
Oh, you guys, we have to get it!

696
01:13:49,735 --> 01:13:51,668
Give me your hand.
Untie me.

697
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:58,475
Hurry.

698
01:14:13,192 --> 01:14:15,125
Hello?

699
01:14:15,127 --> 01:14:19,095
Only one lucky family will
call this house their home.

700
01:14:19,097 --> 01:14:20,997
Fuck you!

701
01:14:29,741 --> 01:14:31,107
Jason, Jason!

702
01:14:31,109 --> 01:14:32,843
Jason!

703
01:14:32,845 --> 01:14:34,244
There's nothing here,
there's nothing here.

704
01:14:34,246 --> 01:14:39,082
Are you all right? Huh?
Bitch was on me.

705
01:14:39,084 --> 01:14:42,986
Who was on you?
I don't know who she was.

706
01:14:42,988 --> 01:14:47,557
Have you seen her before?
Have you?

707
01:14:47,559 --> 01:14:50,994
Yes.
Where?

708
01:14:50,996 --> 01:14:54,164
When I hit that deer
a couple of months ago.

709
01:14:54,166 --> 01:14:55,732
Yeah?

710
01:14:57,902 --> 01:15:00,570
It wasn't a deer.

711
01:15:00,572 --> 01:15:04,908
You hit a person?
Yes!

712
01:15:06,911 --> 01:15:09,946
Some woman was jogging at night.

713
01:15:09,948 --> 01:15:12,883
It was like four miles from here.

714
01:15:15,019 --> 01:15:17,587
Fuck! She was running at night!

715
01:15:19,123 --> 01:15:23,727
What did you do?
I left.

716
01:15:30,902 --> 01:15:35,238
What happened in the woods?
She fucking hit me with a log!

717
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:39,776
With Emmy.
Did you attack her?

718
01:15:41,946 --> 01:15:46,316
Jesus, Dad, don't buy into their shit!
Shut up.

719
01:15:57,595 --> 01:16:01,798
You made it... to the road.

720
01:16:13,144 --> 01:16:15,178
Let's get out of here.

721
01:16:17,949 --> 01:16:19,282
No!

722
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:25,655
No!

723
01:16:25,657 --> 01:16:27,657
Dad!

724
01:16:34,999 --> 01:16:36,666
Dad, the gun!

725
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:45,909
Give me the fucking gun!
Give it to me!

726
01:16:45,911 --> 01:16:47,944
Give it to me!

727
01:16:56,087 --> 01:17:00,190
Don.
Don, how did you do it?

728
01:17:00,192 --> 01:17:04,761
How did you get to the road?
Don, how did you get to the road?

729
01:17:13,871 --> 01:17:18,308
He was going to kill us!
No, he wasn't.

730
01:17:20,745 --> 01:17:22,946
What do you mean?

731
01:17:27,985 --> 01:17:29,786
Don't leave.

732
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:37,661
Don't do this!

733
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:39,996
Charlie, don't do this!

734
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:53,410
6485.

735
01:17:53,412 --> 01:17:55,679
Feel free to take a look around.

736
01:17:57,983 --> 01:18:00,216
Feel free to take a look around.

737
01:18:06,090 --> 01:18:08,692
Do you think there are only five?

738
01:18:25,843 --> 01:18:27,410
What now?

739
01:18:31,015 --> 01:18:33,016
I don't know.

740
01:18:37,488 --> 01:18:39,389
Without food...

741
01:18:41,258 --> 01:18:44,994
I want to go home.
You are at home.

742
01:19:34,145 --> 01:19:36,513
This was their house.

743
01:19:57,067 --> 01:19:58,902
Hey.

744
01:20:03,174 --> 01:20:05,108
Is that the woman?

745
01:20:11,081 --> 01:20:12,582
Go to hell.

746
01:20:46,217 --> 01:20:51,288
Emmy thinks her mom left me,
that she met somebody else.

747
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:53,423
Just tell her.

748
01:20:53,425 --> 01:20:56,326
She'd never forgive me,
and she'd hate you even more.

749
01:20:56,328 --> 01:20:59,529
Charlie, got to hell.

750
01:20:59,531 --> 01:21:03,299
You made your decision, I'm not
gonna live with your guilt!

751
01:21:13,978 --> 01:21:18,114
Why don't you tell her?
Tell her.

752
01:21:18,116 --> 01:21:22,118
Shut up.
You brought it up.

753
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:48,278
You want...

754
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:50,680
Susan to look at your wound?

755
01:21:50,682 --> 01:21:54,150
Do you want Susan
to look at your wound?

756
01:21:58,389 --> 01:22:00,256
Don't touch him.

757
01:22:02,593 --> 01:22:05,395
Don't you dare touch him.

758
01:22:05,397 --> 01:22:07,530
No, stop.

759
01:23:39,490 --> 01:23:43,226
I'd rather starve to death than
eat any more of that stuff.

760
01:23:52,202 --> 01:23:54,804
I want you to take this,
hide it in your jacket,

761
01:23:54,806 --> 01:23:56,706
and don't go anywhere without it.

762
01:23:56,708 --> 01:23:58,341
Why?

763
01:24:00,344 --> 01:24:04,047
I'm going to try
to get to the road.

764
01:24:04,049 --> 01:24:06,516
It's not safe.

765
01:24:06,518 --> 01:24:10,319
Either I get to the road
or we all die here.

766
01:24:10,321 --> 01:24:13,156
It's as simple as that.

767
01:24:18,395 --> 01:24:20,797
But what if you don't come back?

768
01:24:23,834 --> 01:24:26,169
I'll make it back.

769
01:24:28,272 --> 01:24:29,705
I promise.

770
01:25:13,617 --> 01:25:15,585
You going out there?

771
01:25:17,855 --> 01:25:19,555
Yeah.

772
01:25:51,155 --> 01:25:52,922
Just wait a second.

773
01:25:54,725 --> 01:25:58,461
Whatever happens here,
I want you to know...

774
01:25:58,463 --> 01:26:02,865
no one thought your mother
was gonna kill herself, OK?

775
01:26:02,867 --> 01:26:04,700
What do you mean?

776
01:26:04,702 --> 01:26:09,673
I mean your father and I were seeing each
other for a year before your mother died.

777
01:26:10,275 --> 01:26:12,675
Why are you telling me this?

778
01:26:12,677 --> 01:26:15,178
I thought you should know.

779
01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:18,881
When your father told
your mother about us...

780
01:26:18,883 --> 01:26:22,185
he couldn't have known
what she was gonna do.

781
01:26:22,187 --> 01:26:23,786
Right?

782
01:26:31,328 --> 01:26:34,797
My dad says she met someone else.

783
01:26:34,799 --> 01:26:37,366
No.

784
01:26:37,368 --> 01:26:40,570
Your father was worried
about a messy divorce.

785
01:26:40,572 --> 01:26:43,472
Maybe she was, too.

786
01:26:43,474 --> 01:26:45,274
You little bitch!

787
01:26:46,843 --> 01:26:49,679
If I had known I was gonna
have to put up with you,

788
01:26:49,681 --> 01:26:53,449
I would have thought twice about
marrying your fucking father!

789
01:27:00,791 --> 01:27:03,359
I'll do it. I will!

790
01:27:04,928 --> 01:27:06,629
Do it.

791
01:27:08,365 --> 01:27:09,932
That's her!

792
01:27:25,482 --> 01:27:27,316
Hello?

793
01:27:28,852 --> 01:27:30,920
Hello?

794
01:27:35,525 --> 01:27:37,326
Is there somebody there?

795
01:27:41,999 --> 01:27:44,467
Well.

796
01:27:44,469 --> 01:27:47,903
Are you just gonna stand there?

797
01:27:49,606 --> 01:27:53,509
Have you...
been here...

798
01:27:53,511 --> 01:27:55,478
the whole time?

799
01:27:56,780 --> 01:27:58,914
I need to get us out of here.

800
01:27:58,916 --> 01:28:02,718
There are bigger issues to
deal with at the moment.

801
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:06,389
Really?
Oh, yeah.

802
01:28:06,391 --> 01:28:07,690
What?

803
01:28:07,692 --> 01:28:13,596
Susan is gonna tell
Emmy about Diane.

804
01:28:13,598 --> 01:28:17,566
She doesn't know.
Maybe she figured it out.

805
01:28:17,568 --> 01:28:20,569
I never told her.

806
01:28:20,571 --> 01:28:23,072
I never told anyone.

807
01:28:23,074 --> 01:28:27,410
It was an accident, right?
You wanted out.

808
01:28:27,412 --> 01:28:29,745
We wanted Susan.

809
01:28:29,747 --> 01:28:32,315
It looked like a suicide.

810
01:28:32,317 --> 01:28:35,318
We got a second chance.

811
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:39,722
And now Susan is going
to tell Emmy the truth,

812
01:28:39,724 --> 01:28:42,525
Emmy won't be able to take it.

813
01:28:42,527 --> 01:28:45,695
And then there's the girl.

814
01:28:45,697 --> 01:28:47,730
What about her?

815
01:28:47,732 --> 01:28:51,667
Well, she isn't part
of this family.

816
01:28:51,669 --> 01:28:55,037
There won't be any help

817
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:59,709
till all the problems in
that house are dealt with.

818
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:38,381
Emmy?

819
01:29:48,892 --> 01:29:50,659
What happened?

820
01:29:54,131 --> 01:29:56,766
You said Mom met someone.

821
01:29:59,669 --> 01:30:01,804
What really happened?

822
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:07,476
Did Susan do this?
What did she tell you?

823
01:30:08,979 --> 01:30:12,014
It was an accident.

824
01:30:12,016 --> 01:30:13,983
What was?

825
01:30:20,457 --> 01:30:24,693
I had nothing to do with it.
With what?

826
01:30:28,632 --> 01:30:31,567
It's all going to be OK.

827
01:30:33,537 --> 01:30:36,939
Once we clear all this up...

828
01:30:38,809 --> 01:30:40,743
we can leave.

829
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:52,455
Susan!

830
01:31:15,745 --> 01:31:18,914
What are you doing?
I'm getting out of here.

831
01:31:21,985 --> 01:31:24,820
How?
I'm going to walk.

832
01:31:28,492 --> 01:31:30,659
What did you tell Emmy?

833
01:31:34,564 --> 01:31:37,266
Let me go.
You bitch.

834
01:31:37,268 --> 01:31:41,704
You wanted this, Charlie.
You're gonna have to pay for it.

835
01:31:45,542 --> 01:31:47,142
You?

836
01:31:47,144 --> 01:31:48,844
I didn't put them there.

837
01:31:48,846 --> 01:31:50,647
Then how did they get there?
I don't know!

838
01:31:50,648 --> 01:31:52,915
You're taking food out of
my daughter's mouth...

839
01:31:52,917 --> 01:31:56,051
I said I did not put them there!

840
01:31:58,154 --> 01:32:01,624
I don't care about your
precious daughter.

841
01:32:01,626 --> 01:32:03,025
Get off of me!

842
01:32:45,869 --> 01:32:48,337
What did you do?

843
01:32:48,339 --> 01:32:50,606
You just got to understand.

844
01:32:52,976 --> 01:32:55,144
She was gonna destroy us.

845
01:32:57,614 --> 01:32:59,715
Did you kill her?

846
01:32:59,717 --> 01:33:05,388
We're this much closer
to being able to leave.

847
01:33:07,924 --> 01:33:11,093
There's only the girl now.

848
01:33:11,095 --> 01:33:12,995
Don't you trust me?

849
01:33:12,997 --> 01:33:16,632
When you said "an accident,"

850
01:33:16,634 --> 01:33:20,703
what did you mean?
Why, are you afraid?

851
01:33:20,705 --> 01:33:22,104
Please?

852
01:33:23,707 --> 01:33:26,709
It's you and me, kiddo.

853
01:33:26,711 --> 01:33:29,645
We've got to stick together.

854
01:33:29,647 --> 01:33:34,783
We don't even know
who this girl is.

855
01:33:34,785 --> 01:33:37,886
What did you mean
about an accident?

856
01:33:39,089 --> 01:33:43,993
Did you mean Mom?
Emmy.

857
01:33:45,895 --> 01:33:47,930
Come here.

858
01:33:49,633 --> 01:33:53,335
Leave the girl.
She cannot go with us.

859
01:33:53,337 --> 01:33:57,806
Please, Dad!
Get back.

860
01:33:59,909 --> 01:34:01,710
Emmy.

861
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:06,148
I'm your father.

862
01:34:06,150 --> 01:34:09,418
I know what's right.

863
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:12,187
She's part of this.

864
01:34:12,189 --> 01:34:14,923
You have to let me handle it.

865
01:34:19,362 --> 01:34:20,996
Emmy.

866
01:34:22,699 --> 01:34:26,301
Do not make me angry.

867
01:34:26,303 --> 01:34:27,836
Hmm?

868
01:34:27,838 --> 01:34:31,907
Do you know what
I just did for you?

869
01:34:31,909 --> 01:34:34,443
She was taking the food,

870
01:34:34,745 --> 01:34:38,280
taking the food out of
my daughter's mouth.

871
01:34:38,282 --> 01:34:40,115
I could not have that happen.

872
01:34:40,117 --> 01:34:43,352
I would never let anyone hurt you.

873
01:34:43,354 --> 01:34:45,721
Just stay right there!

874
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:49,391

01:34:55,832 --> 01:34:57,066
Hey.

877
01:35:42,278 --> 01:35:46,882
Emmy.
Emmy!

878
01:35:46,884 --> 01:35:49,284
You shouldn't be out here,
it's not safe.

879
01:35:51,488 --> 01:35:55,524
Emmy!
Emmy!

880
01:36:01,798 --> 01:36:02,931
Emmy.

881
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:06,068
Emmy.

882
01:36:08,404 --> 01:36:10,139
No, Dad!

883
01:36:10,141 --> 01:36:13,909
Don't worry, I'm gonna
take care of everything.

884
01:36:13,911 --> 01:36:17,045
No, don't!
Just do it.

885
01:36:17,047 --> 01:36:19,047
No!

886
01:36:46,476 --> 01:36:47,843
Look.

887
01:36:49,112 --> 01:36:52,581
Look.
I was right.

888
01:36:54,017 --> 01:36:56,151
I was right.

889
01:37:09,232 --> 01:37:11,400
Help me!

890
01:37:19,509 --> 01:37:21,577
Is she OK?
Are you all right?

891
01:37:21,579 --> 01:37:25,848
Are you OK?
Can you speak?

892
01:37:25,850 --> 01:37:27,282
Be careful.

893
01:37:27,284 --> 01:37:30,853
Watch her head.
Come on, come on, come on.

894
01:37:30,855 --> 01:37:32,221
Come on.

895
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:38,060
Sweetheart, sweetheart,
is there someone after you?

896
01:37:43,633 --> 01:37:45,100
We're all right now.

897
01:37:46,436 --> 01:37:49,972
Hey, hey, hey,
whoa, whoa, whoa, relax!

898
01:37:49,974 --> 01:37:51,640
Please!

899
01:37:51,642 --> 01:37:53,141
You're all right now,
you're all right now.

900
01:37:53,143 --> 01:37:55,544
Is there someone after you?
We found her on the road.

901
01:37:55,546 --> 01:37:58,247
Hey, who's that?
There's somebody.

902
01:37:58,249 --> 01:37:59,982
Hey, mister!

903
01:38:22,472 --> 01:38:24,907
She's back, Daddy.

904
01:38:26,342 --> 01:38:28,443
No!

01:38:28,445 --> 01:38:30,379
