1
00:00:45,914 --> 00:00:48,349
If someone had asked me
not long ago...

2
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:52,287
... why I thought men left women
and never came back...

3
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:54,355
...I would have said this:

4
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,824
New cow.

5
00:00:58,126 --> 00:01:01,262
The new cow theory was born
of a broken heart.

6
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:06,267
It came to me while reading about male
behavior in The New York Times...

7
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:09,504
... which chronicled
a fascinating study...

8
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:13,308
...on the mating preferences
of the male cow.

9
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:18,446
First, a bull was presented with...

10
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,049
...a cow.

11
00:01:21,783 --> 00:01:23,051
They mated.

12
00:01:26,788 --> 00:01:30,992
The next day, the bull
was presented with the same cow.

13
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:37,498
The bull wasn't interested.
He wanted new cow.

14
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:40,134
And this was old cow.

15
00:01:44,806 --> 00:01:49,878
To see if they could trick the bull,
scientists used an ingenious ploy.

16
00:01:51,913 --> 00:01:55,350
The old cow was smeared
with new cow scent.

17
00:01:57,552 --> 00:01:59,153
But he was no fool.

18
00:01:59,988 --> 00:02:04,425
This wasn't new cow.
This was just old cow incognito.

19
00:02:05,026 --> 00:02:10,265
Old cow in sheep's clothing.
Mutton dressed as lamb.

20
00:02:17,172 --> 00:02:19,340
I'm getting ahead of myself.

21
00:02:19,574 --> 00:02:23,244
To understand the theory
and how it took over my life...

22
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:26,047
...you need to hear
the whole story.

23
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:32,253
When I met Ray, I was booking talent
for The Diane Roberts Show...

24
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,357
...a New York talk show
that had just been syndicated.

25
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:41,129
We'd been given a small window
of opportunity to prove ourselves.

26
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:45,533
We're back with Mary Lou Corkle,
conservative activist...

27
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:49,704
...who's here to talk about her
new book, The Nest Crisis.

28
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:52,407
One of your central arguments...

29
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,811
...is to blame society's problems
on working mothers.

30
00:02:57,045 --> 00:02:59,714
Diane wanted to reach
her audience...

31
00:02:59,948 --> 00:03:03,251
...by appealing to both their
understimulated brains...

32
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:06,788
...and their overstimulated
appetite for tabloids.

33
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:10,792
Ambition's blinded these women
to familial duties.

34
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:16,164
So, doing what I do makes me
unfit for motherhood.

35
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:18,800
We make our own beds, don't we?

36
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:22,737
That is true.
Who makes your kids' beds...

37
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:27,642
...while you've been out selling
your book these past three months?

38
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:31,246
My job was to supply
a steady diet of raw meat...

39
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,982
...to sate Diane's
Emmy-clad ambitions.

40
00:03:34,182 --> 00:03:38,753
Hi, Donald, we've gone national.
We've started a new format.

41
00:03:38,987 --> 00:03:42,090
Major exposure.
It's perfect for Hillary.

42
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:46,094
She'd be among the first.
Trust me, everyone wants on.

43
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:52,534
My only colleague was writer,
producer and womanizer, Eddie Alden.

44
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,237
-How we doing?
-Publisher's having a coronary.

45
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:59,040
-That good?
-You book them, I cook them.

46
00:03:59,274 --> 00:04:01,176
Right on. Yeah.

47
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:04,612
Thank you, we're talking
to Mary Lou Corkle....

48
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:09,150
Any progress with Cuba?
Well, just keep trying.

49
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,555
This Castro thing's gonna kill me.
She won't let it go.

50
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:18,226
-Forget Castro. Get a creative angle.
-Such as?

51
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,462
-Elena de la Goya.
-Who?

52
00:04:21,663 --> 00:04:25,466
One of the women the CIA hired
to kill him in the '60s.

53
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:29,671
-This is a smoke-free building.
-Blow me.

54
00:04:29,871 --> 00:04:34,209
The CIA created a "scent of death"
oil that smelled like perfume.

55
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:37,178
She'd wear it, he'd kiss and lick--

56
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:41,316
-Don't editorialize.
-Sorry. He was supposed to croak....

57
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:45,420
Eddie could find the sex factor
in almost any subject.

58
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,856
He considered this a gift.

59
00:04:48,156 --> 00:04:52,093
-You forgot these earrings.
-You don't waste any time.

60
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,895
-Cynic.
-Slut.

61
00:04:54,162 --> 00:04:57,398
If Eddie was enough
to make me lose hope in men...

62
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:00,735
-Got a minute?
-...it only took one to bring it back.

63
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:04,539
-Hey, Ray.
-We haven't met yet. I'm Ray Brown.

64
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:10,778
-Our new executive producer.
-From Washington.

65
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:15,750
I saw your piece for Newsline.
That was brilliant.

66
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,021
Thank you. We just did a follow-up.
That's why I'm late.

67
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:23,758
I'd better scoot.
Jane, want me to turn up the AC?

68
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,094
You look a little flushed.

69
00:05:27,362 --> 00:05:28,630
Okay.

70
00:05:30,198 --> 00:05:32,233
-Jane Goodale.
-I know.

71
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:36,404
Interesting. People must
confuse you with the scientist.

72
00:05:36,638 --> 00:05:39,541
-They ask if I'm into chimps.
-Are you?

73
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:45,547
-Maybe Curious George when I was 5.
-He was a monkey, not a chimp.

74
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,217
-He knows his primates.
-I do. See you around.

75
00:05:49,551 --> 00:05:52,487
I heard Lynne Cheney's people
are difficult.

76
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:55,657
They fear it'll turn
into an abortion debate.

77
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,893
-Which is right.
-Of course.

78
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:04,299
Say Diane won't bring it up, and plant
someone to initiate it during Q and A.

79
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:07,468
You came to the right show, Ray Brown.

80
00:06:10,138 --> 00:06:12,507
-So he's cute?
-Very.

81
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,075
Care to elaborate?

82
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:19,013
Pale blue eyes, athletic,
sort of J. Crew, but not as preppy.

83
00:06:19,247 --> 00:06:22,650
-That guy again.
-You gonna buy anything or not?

84
00:06:22,951 --> 00:06:25,587
-Shush, I'm concentrating.
-Okay.

85
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:28,423
-Marital status?
-Girlfriend.

86
00:06:28,623 --> 00:06:32,560
-Why are we having this talk?
-Right. It's too much work.

87
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,998
Even if I were up for it,
he'd probably end up marrying her.

88
00:06:37,198 --> 00:06:40,935
Wow! There's the cynical bitch
I know and love.

89
00:06:41,302 --> 00:06:44,172
Case closed.
I'm leaving this one alone.

90
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,310
-Feeling carnivorous?
-Absolutely.

91
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:54,816
What else should I know about you?

92
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:57,952
Apart from your addiction
to processed foods...

93
00:06:58,152 --> 00:07:00,788
...much to the chagrin
of your girlfriend...?

94
00:07:01,456 --> 00:07:02,891
Dee.

95
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,194
Whom you've been dating now for...?

96
00:07:06,528 --> 00:07:09,163
-Three years.
-Three--

97
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:12,901
Excuse me.
Three years. Wow.

98
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:19,741
That's more serious than I would
have guessed, you know, off the cuff.

99
00:07:21,176 --> 00:07:27,315
I guess. Think you'll ever get to the
moment where you just know it's right?

100
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:33,154
That's it? That's the person
you're meant to be with forever?

101
00:07:36,691 --> 00:07:38,092
Probably.

102
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:42,063
God, he was cute.

103
00:07:43,932 --> 00:07:46,267
-It's me!
-We're in here.

104
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:49,671
-Just jab it in!
-Don't rush me!

105
00:07:49,871 --> 00:07:53,408
-What's going on?
-Your sister started on injections.

106
00:07:53,675 --> 00:07:57,378
-Of orange juice?
-Fertility drugs, Jane.

107
00:07:57,612 --> 00:07:59,781
The orange is for practice.

108
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:05,453
If you can't stick it into a Valencia,
what about my ass?

109
00:08:05,687 --> 00:08:09,123
If it's not done right,
we'll lose another month.

110
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:21,069
-That's supposed to be my job.
-See how easy it is?

111
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:25,940
This is an emotional time and you're
sucking the romance out of it.

112
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:32,413
We kissed romance goodbye when you
started jacking off into a cup weekly.

113
00:08:32,614 --> 00:08:35,049
Leave my sperm count out of it!

114
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:38,119
Chubby Hubby?

115
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:43,224
I'll look at the
dirty magazines with you.

116
00:08:49,998 --> 00:08:55,270
That's great, just great.
Very nice! Very grown up.

117
00:08:55,503 --> 00:08:57,639
At least one of us is.

118
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,240
Morning.

119
00:08:59,474 --> 00:09:02,777
Don't bother.
I already know you're an asshole.

120
00:09:03,444 --> 00:09:08,183
You always complain about your
small place. Move in with me.

121
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:10,585
-You can't be serious.
-Why not?

122
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:14,656
I only meet hip successful types.
I want someone like you.

123
00:09:14,856 --> 00:09:18,493
-Gee, thanks.
-This would be strictly financial.

124
00:09:18,693 --> 00:09:21,863
-I've no interest in you that way.
-What a relief.

125
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:24,332
-Is that a no?
-Actually, it's a:

126
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:28,002
"Thanks, but not if my life
depended on it."

127
00:09:47,622 --> 00:09:50,959
-Hello.
-You up for a walk?

128
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,418
-What?
-What?

129
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:21,189
I was just gonna--

130
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:25,560
I can't speak.
You say something.

131
00:10:25,827 --> 00:10:29,731
No, no, don't.
Do you think I'm insane?

132
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,701
Not at all.

133
00:10:37,906 --> 00:10:42,343
I was thinking how good
my place looks with you in it.

134
00:11:11,973 --> 00:11:14,042
-M Magazine.
-Let's start again.

135
00:11:14,242 --> 00:11:17,412
You ate Cocoa Puffs,
then a couple cartoons....

136
00:11:17,645 --> 00:11:20,615
-A Tweety and a Road Runner.
-Then more kissing.

137
00:11:20,882 --> 00:11:22,784
-Right.
-Okay, go on.

138
00:11:23,051 --> 00:11:27,589
We got ready for work.
I walked him to the door and--

139
00:11:28,823 --> 00:11:32,060
-Big finale-type kiss before leaving?
-Exactly.

140
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:36,731
-That's good. Very good, considering.
-Considering what?

141
00:11:36,965 --> 00:11:39,400
Considering he's picked out his wife!

142
00:11:39,634 --> 00:11:43,238
I told you, they're having problems.
They're not engaged.

143
00:11:43,438 --> 00:11:49,611
Yet. He sounds like a prospect,
so here's what you do.

144
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:53,815
Pretend she doesn't exist.
Never mention her name.

145
00:11:54,015 --> 00:11:57,819
If he mentions her, you nod politely.
Change the subject.

146
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:03,858
If you bring her up, he'll feel pushed.
This way it's like, "No pressure."

147
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,028
-It'll drive him nuts.
-Where do you get this?

148
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:10,932
Snag-men-dot-com.
It's very informative.

149
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:12,634
-God.
-Read the papers.

150
00:12:12,867 --> 00:12:16,804
Twenty-three-year-old women
are lying about their age.

151
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:20,775
Miss "I have a crush so I'm in denial,"
get on your game!

152
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:26,848
What do I do now when I see him
in my staff meeting in five minutes?

153
00:12:27,115 --> 00:12:30,051
That's easy.
Pretend he doesn't exist.

154
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:34,522
Good morning, Eddie.

155
00:12:40,695 --> 00:12:44,799
-What is on your neck?
-I bit myself shaving.

156
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:49,037
-Isn't that why God made turtlenecks?
-It's why God made Darlene.

157
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:50,872
You are so gross.

158
00:12:51,306 --> 00:12:53,408
-Hey, Eddie. Hi, Jane.
-Hey, Ray.

159
00:12:53,675 --> 00:12:55,310
Hey, Ray, good morning.

160
00:13:00,315 --> 00:13:02,784
You okay? You look a little tired.

161
00:13:03,885 --> 00:13:06,354
Evelyn. Straw.

162
00:13:07,155 --> 00:13:09,924
Okay. I'm late.
I know. I'm sorry.

163
00:13:10,158 --> 00:13:15,763
I locked myself out of the apartment.
Nightmare. The only reason I'm here...

164
00:13:16,064 --> 00:13:19,534
...is because of Habib.
Nicest cabdriver in this city.

165
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:24,939
-Who saw ABC's 4 a.m. newscast?
-I think a lot of us missed that.

166
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,845
It told how single media outlets aren't
working. Where are we on interactive?

167
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:36,251
-The web site should be up Monday.
-Not should be, will be!

168
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:42,690
We cannot sell this show on the budget
they gave. We need streaming 24/7.

169
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:46,794
And we need to make every show count.
Remember...

170
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:50,098
-...it is all about the get.
-The get.

171
00:13:51,032 --> 00:13:55,570
We cannot make a splash if we get
the gets everybody's already gotten.

172
00:13:55,803 --> 00:13:58,273
-I need the ungettable get.
-Got it.

173
00:13:58,606 --> 00:14:00,074
Good.

174
00:14:00,308 --> 00:14:02,577
Okay, where are we on Fidel?

175
00:14:04,245 --> 00:14:08,283
I spoke with Juanita,
his foreign press secretary...

176
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:11,486
...who assured me that the moment...

177
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:16,090
...el presidente was back
from his fantasy baseball camp...

178
00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:20,161
-...she would ask him about it.
-Did she imply interest?

179
00:14:21,963 --> 00:14:25,166
Did she discuss availability?
Do we have a shot?

180
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:28,169
-Jane!
-Sorry.

181
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:31,739
What do you think your chances
are of getting him?

182
00:14:33,141 --> 00:14:37,312
I think they're good, Diane.
I think they're very good.

183
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:15,116
Just a minute.

184
00:15:33,535 --> 00:15:39,073
Sorry. I thought
I'd just do a few sit-ups.

185
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:05,533
Joy: the emotion evoked by the
prospect of possessing one's desires.

186
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:13,508
Rapture: the experience of being
carried away by emotion or passion.

187
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:23,885
Ecstasy: a state of being
beyond reason and self-control.

188
00:16:27,055 --> 00:16:30,058
I cannot feel my legs.
Tell me what we're doing.

189
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,893
We're coming up for air.

190
00:16:32,193 --> 00:16:36,764
-Besides I owe you a shirt.
-Hey, that's a good idea.

191
00:16:37,465 --> 00:16:38,566
-Blue?
-Yeah.

192
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,238
This one's pretty.
With your eyes.

193
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:48,243
Could be risky, given your
impatience with buttons.

194
00:16:51,913 --> 00:16:55,350
-I love it.
-My treat.

195
00:16:55,717 --> 00:17:00,154
-Shut up. Let me buy you a shirt.
-Thank you.

196
00:17:00,955 --> 00:17:03,992
-Hey, guys.
-Eddie! Hey.

197
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:06,394
-What are you doing?
-I just....

198
00:17:06,594 --> 00:17:08,830
She's helping me pick a shirt.

199
00:17:09,097 --> 00:17:14,269
-Well, I didn't mean to intrude.
-Not at all, please.

200
00:17:15,904 --> 00:17:19,941
I gotta go to a thing.
Great running into you.

201
00:17:20,175 --> 00:17:22,610
-Both of you! My God.
-See you.

202
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,313
-All right.
-Okay.

203
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:30,151
What a coincidence. First I run
into Ray, and then you.

204
00:17:30,451 --> 00:17:34,956
I didn't even know he lived
around here and there he is!

205
00:17:37,258 --> 00:17:40,862
Okay, so I am sleeping with him.

206
00:17:41,095 --> 00:17:44,199
If you tell anyone at the office,
so help me God....

207
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,769
What are you thinking?

208
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,439
I'm thinking the same thing you are.

209
00:17:51,673 --> 00:17:56,444
Happily ever after with your
matching Volvos and chocolate Labs.

210
00:17:56,678 --> 00:18:00,682
-See you Monday.
-Did you have friends growing up?

211
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:03,551
I think he's waiting down the street.

212
00:19:23,198 --> 00:19:25,099
I love you, Jane.

213
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:33,942
I love you too.

214
00:19:41,816 --> 00:19:44,419
He just said it after only six weeks?

215
00:19:44,652 --> 00:19:48,456
Oh, my God. It takes most guys
a year to use the "L" word.

216
00:19:48,723 --> 00:19:53,428
When they do, they're usually
on top of you, so it doesn't count.

217
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:57,232
-What about Dee?
-He's telling her tomorrow.

218
00:19:57,465 --> 00:20:00,835
-Why didn't he already?
-It's complicated.

219
00:20:01,102 --> 00:20:05,840
If he had second thoughts, I don't
think he'd ask me to live with him.

220
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:10,044
He asked you to live with him?
My God. What did you say?

221
00:20:10,311 --> 00:20:15,416
Yes. He started calling realtors,
and I gave my landlord notice.

222
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:22,290
Wow! Mazel tov.
I can't believe this!

223
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:28,263
You're getting asked to play house,
and I'm on hell's blind-date circuit.

224
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,599
-I take it last night didn't go well.
-Awful.

225
00:20:31,866 --> 00:20:37,438
When Julian offers one of his straight
friends, shoot me before I say yes.

226
00:20:37,672 --> 00:20:39,774
I'm in a sad state.

227
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:44,946
And I'm telling you, it's just
screaming "potential." Hello?

228
00:20:45,146 --> 00:20:47,549
-I didn't mean to intrude.
-We're fine.

229
00:20:47,782 --> 00:20:49,817
Didn't you want to see the patio?

230
00:20:50,018 --> 00:20:55,356
Isn't it just wonderful? Wait till
you see the view, it's spectacular.

231
00:20:55,557 --> 00:20:58,126
Right down to the World Trade Center.

232
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:08,069
It's such a jewel box.

233
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:14,676
I guess I'll leave you two alone
to talk things over.

234
00:21:15,877 --> 00:21:18,813
-Oh, my God. It's unbelievable.
-I love it!

235
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:22,050
The light is so good.
I love you.

236
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,755
I don't know.

237
00:21:31,492 --> 00:21:35,730
I gotta go.
He looks like he's been hit by a bus.

238
00:21:36,064 --> 00:21:37,932
I'll call you back.

239
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:44,873
-I feel like I've been hit by a bus.
-You told her?

240
00:21:49,244 --> 00:21:52,914
-Was it bad?
-Not like I thought.

241
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:58,353
I mean, she didn't go hysterical
or anything like that.

242
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:04,626
She was just, you know, eerily calm
about the whole thing.

243
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:08,963
-Well, that's good, right?
-Yeah. I just meant--

244
00:22:09,197 --> 00:22:14,602
-It wasn't what I expected, is all.
-What did she say about us?

245
00:22:17,572 --> 00:22:21,543
I didn't tell her.
I just didn't think it was necessary.

246
00:22:21,776 --> 00:22:26,748
To hit her over the head with this
after three years, it just seemed...

247
00:22:27,048 --> 00:22:30,251
...so awful. I just told her
that it was over.

248
00:22:30,552 --> 00:22:33,388
And I think that's all
she needs to know.

249
00:22:33,588 --> 00:22:37,458
Sure. And she was okay with that?

250
00:22:37,725 --> 00:22:42,931
I guess. I don't know.
It was weird. She just kind of....

251
00:22:44,933 --> 00:22:47,902
You know,
she just kind of went cold on me.

252
00:22:48,136 --> 00:22:50,905
I mean, she's upset.

253
00:22:51,406 --> 00:22:54,876
She's upset, the poor thing.
She's gotta be upset.

254
00:22:55,109 --> 00:23:00,148
She didn't seem terribly upset so....

255
00:23:00,415 --> 00:23:03,251
Well, you're okay with it, right?

256
00:23:05,753 --> 00:23:09,290
-I mean, you're happy?
-Happy.

257
00:23:09,524 --> 00:23:13,194
I am so happy.
I mean, this is what I wanted.

258
00:23:13,461 --> 00:23:17,298
I mean, there's nothing
between us anymore.

259
00:23:17,532 --> 00:23:20,502
That's what I was looking for,
so I'm happy.

260
00:23:23,872 --> 00:23:26,975
How exactly did Ray disappear?

261
00:23:27,442 --> 00:23:31,179
Slowly and kind of subtly.

262
00:23:32,347 --> 00:23:35,717
-Single pane, double pane?
-Single pane, I believe.

263
00:23:35,984 --> 00:23:40,121
Singles, wow. A lot more sun
than I had recalled.

264
00:23:40,321 --> 00:23:44,826
This doesn't open?
Oh, well, gotta force it.

265
00:23:45,026 --> 00:23:47,695
Well, maybe it wasn't so subtle.

266
00:23:47,996 --> 00:23:53,902
It's me again. The realtor said
we have to sign the lease by Monday.

267
00:23:54,135 --> 00:23:58,106
I know you wanted your lawyer
to look at the contract...

268
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:02,143
...but my apartment's been rented.
I have to be out--

269
00:24:09,217 --> 00:24:12,187
He's not sleeping with somebody else.

270
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:15,890
Ray isn't like that.
The poor guy wouldn't have time.

271
00:24:16,157 --> 00:24:18,726
He's been working until 3 a.m.
every night.

272
00:24:18,993 --> 00:24:22,864
All guys have time to mess around.

273
00:24:23,064 --> 00:24:29,003
If he ain't sleeping with you,
he ain't sleeping alone. Right?

274
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:34,042
You gotta talk to him.
It's better than not knowing.

275
00:24:34,275 --> 00:24:38,213
-Oh, come on.
-Sorry, this patch is worth shit.

276
00:24:40,248 --> 00:24:46,855
Prey species have developed
a wide variety of escape behaviors.

277
00:24:47,088 --> 00:24:50,425
Freezing is a common response
to predator alarm.

278
00:24:50,692 --> 00:24:56,064
Sensing danger, many animals will
assume a rigid, statue-like position.

279
00:24:56,297 --> 00:24:59,400
Fleeing is another popular method.

280
00:24:59,634 --> 00:25:02,904
Some species will try
to outrun their captors...

281
00:25:03,104 --> 00:25:06,307
... while others take
an erratic zigzag course...

282
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:10,311
...in the hopes that direction
shifts will tire the predator...

283
00:25:10,545 --> 00:25:13,948
...causing her to give up the chase.

284
00:25:15,116 --> 00:25:18,086
Smell the bacon, Jane?

285
00:25:21,623 --> 00:25:26,594
What's happening here?
We haven't been alone in a week.

286
00:25:26,895 --> 00:25:32,133
We lost that apartment because
your lawyer supposedly messed up...

287
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:36,304
...which is okay, but as of Saturday
I don't have a home.

288
00:25:36,571 --> 00:25:39,340
Ray, what the hell's going on?

289
00:25:41,242 --> 00:25:43,278
I don't think I can do this.

290
00:25:44,846 --> 00:25:47,982
-Do what?
-This.

291
00:25:49,817 --> 00:25:52,954
-Us.
-What?

292
00:25:54,622 --> 00:25:56,491
Why?

293
00:25:56,991 --> 00:26:01,095
-I don't know?
-What do you mean, you don't know?

294
00:26:01,362 --> 00:26:06,100
-There has to be a reason. Tell me.
-Jane, I'm sorry.

295
00:26:06,301 --> 00:26:09,771
You deserve an answer,
and I don't think I can explain.

296
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:15,376
I thought we felt the same way:

297
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:21,482
Incredibly lucky to have
found the thing.

298
00:26:21,716 --> 00:26:25,887
-I do. I did.
-And here you go.

299
00:26:32,393 --> 00:26:36,698
I just think that we both
need to take a step back.

300
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:42,871
I mean we're talking about
a very serious move here.

301
00:26:43,638 --> 00:26:47,475
I just wanted--
I still....

302
00:26:50,245 --> 00:26:55,717
-I don't know what I'm trying to say.
-I feel like such a jerk.

303
00:26:56,584 --> 00:27:02,056
-Believing that this was--
-Listen to me, I love you.

304
00:27:03,091 --> 00:27:05,894
I want us to be important
to each other.

305
00:27:06,661 --> 00:27:09,063
Please don't do that.

306
00:27:17,505 --> 00:27:19,040
Please go.

307
00:27:46,134 --> 00:27:49,437
There are few things sadder
in this life...

308
00:27:49,704 --> 00:27:53,541
...than watching someone walk away
after they've left you.

309
00:27:53,775 --> 00:27:59,314
Watching the distance between your
bodies expand until there's nothing...

310
00:27:59,581 --> 00:28:03,918
...but empty space and silence.

311
00:28:09,757 --> 00:28:14,762
Remember, time wounds all heels.

312
00:28:32,514 --> 00:28:37,485
-Are you all right?
-Why, don't I look all right?

313
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,990
-You look like you hate my guts.
-I do.

314
00:28:42,257 --> 00:28:43,958
That's nice.

315
00:28:45,293 --> 00:28:49,664
I don't blame you.
This hasn't been easy for me either.

316
00:28:49,931 --> 00:28:53,134
Yeah, you look really destroyed.

317
00:28:54,802 --> 00:28:59,274
Eddie, did you by any chance
ever find a roommate?

318
00:28:59,607 --> 00:29:01,843
Well, no, actually.

319
00:29:02,043 --> 00:29:06,014
The place I was supposed to move into
suddenly fell apart.

320
00:29:06,281 --> 00:29:10,251
My apartment's been re-rented.
Is the offer still good?

321
00:29:11,286 --> 00:29:15,290
-You're moving in with Eddie?
-What's the apartment like?

322
00:29:15,557 --> 00:29:19,127
It's a two-bedroom. Kitchen.
Lots of windows. Living room.

323
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,863
That sounds amazing.
When can I see it?

324
00:29:22,163 --> 00:29:24,966
-You're moving in with Eddie?
-How about tonight?

325
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,637
Perfect.
Everything is just perfect.

326
00:29:36,544 --> 00:29:38,646
-You okay?
-Yeah.

327
00:29:45,753 --> 00:29:48,323
-Here it is.
-It's huge.

328
00:29:48,556 --> 00:29:54,229
Yep. Here's the kitchen,
living room, whatever.

329
00:29:54,429 --> 00:29:57,999
My bedroom, bathroom,
this'd be your room.

330
00:30:03,004 --> 00:30:05,173
What happened here?

331
00:30:05,406 --> 00:30:09,878
I got the urge to renovate.
I'd have it fixed before you moved in.

332
00:30:10,178 --> 00:30:13,581
-You want a drink?
-Sure, some water.

333
00:30:13,848 --> 00:30:17,852
-We don't share a bathroom, do we?
-I never use the bathroom.

334
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:22,190
So how'd you find this place?

335
00:30:22,423 --> 00:30:25,627
My ex-girlfriend worked
in an emergency room.

336
00:30:25,894 --> 00:30:30,598
When someone died she'd check their
address, see if it was rent control.

337
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:34,102
-You lived with somebody?
-Yeah.

338
00:30:34,402 --> 00:30:36,137
For how long?

339
00:30:36,371 --> 00:30:40,208
For a while.
So what do you think?

340
00:30:40,441 --> 00:30:43,244
I think I must be out of my mind.

341
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,739
Morphine for the pain.

342
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:41,062
It was right after she moved out.

343
00:32:47,202 --> 00:32:51,840
I just took an ax
and started hacking away at it.

344
00:32:52,073 --> 00:32:57,512
As if I thought opening up that wall
might make it easier to breathe.

345
00:32:58,179 --> 00:33:00,515
I don't smoke.

346
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,364
Whoa, girl.

347
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,268
You okay?

348
00:33:23,104 --> 00:33:24,873
Oh, yeah.

349
00:33:26,975 --> 00:33:28,910
What was her name?

350
00:33:35,316 --> 00:33:37,585
Rebecca.

351
00:33:40,121 --> 00:33:42,590
Put your shoes on,
we're going downstairs.

352
00:33:42,891 --> 00:33:45,894
-What's downstairs?
-You'll see.

353
00:33:49,731 --> 00:33:51,733
There are two realities:

354
00:33:51,966 --> 00:33:56,905
First, we're in love
and it's incredible, it's perfect.

355
00:33:57,138 --> 00:34:01,576
Then poof! "Sorry, Jane,
doesn't work for me anymore."

356
00:34:01,843 --> 00:34:05,780
-How's that possible?
-You were living a fantasy.

357
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:11,920
Romance, true love, soul mates.
It's all bullshit.

358
00:34:12,153 --> 00:34:16,824
None of it exists.
Trust me, I speak from experience.

359
00:34:18,426 --> 00:34:23,364
Man, she really did
a number on you, didn't she?

360
00:34:23,598 --> 00:34:25,967
Don't shit on my broken heart...

361
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:30,939
...because you've converted to
a warped brand of romantic atheism.

362
00:34:31,172 --> 00:34:35,577
Oh, man, whoo.
It's called self-preservation.

363
00:34:35,777 --> 00:34:40,215
In other words, you narcotize
yourself with casual sex.

364
00:34:40,448 --> 00:34:45,220
That implies I avoid reality
when, in fact, I embrace it.

365
00:34:47,021 --> 00:34:51,392
-Casual sex is very liberating.
-I'll bet.

366
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,137
-I almost feel sorry for her.
-What for?

367
00:35:04,005 --> 00:35:10,311
I make no pretenses. If she puts me up
on a white horse, it's her choice.

368
00:35:10,845 --> 00:35:13,515
We're all grownups here, Jane.

369
00:35:28,563 --> 00:35:32,600
I lay awake that night
wondering which was worse:

370
00:35:32,834 --> 00:35:37,272
Guys like Ray who blinded you
with charms and promises.

371
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:42,377
Or the Eddies who went
right for your pants.

372
00:35:43,178 --> 00:35:44,846
Oh, excuse me.

373
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:48,583
In the end, it didn't matter.
The truth was...

374
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:52,754
...they were all cast
from the same mold.

375
00:35:53,087 --> 00:35:55,223
But the question remained.

376
00:35:55,523 --> 00:35:57,058
Why?

377
00:35:57,859 --> 00:36:01,095
One day by the river,
I found my answer.

378
00:36:04,432 --> 00:36:06,301
Holy shit.

379
00:36:09,871 --> 00:36:15,109
I told them dumbasses it'd
never work. You can't fool a bull.

380
00:36:15,376 --> 00:36:18,680
He knows where he's been.
He won't go back.

381
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,285
Hell, I got 93 cows.
Only one of them got 'nads. Why?

382
00:36:24,552 --> 00:36:28,990
Because that son of a bitch
can knock up the whole herd.

383
00:36:29,224 --> 00:36:32,126
But once he's done, the party's over.

384
00:36:32,327 --> 00:36:36,998
I gotta go to Ed Hickey's place
and trade him for a new one.

385
00:36:37,232 --> 00:36:41,736
There ain't a chance
he'll touch any of them cows again.

386
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:46,674
-I figured it out. I'm the Old Cow.
-I don't get it.

387
00:36:46,908 --> 00:36:50,345
Remember laughing at the
graffiti on the subway?

388
00:36:50,578 --> 00:36:54,749
-"I love the toilet you sit on?"
-"I hate banging the same woman."

389
00:36:54,949 --> 00:37:01,089
-It was true, a window into their--
-Schizophrenic behavior.

390
00:37:01,322 --> 00:37:06,327
The New Cow Theory and "I hate banging
the same woman." Same thing.

391
00:37:06,594 --> 00:37:11,299
Men can't commit because,
eventually, we all become Old Cows.

392
00:37:11,499 --> 00:37:17,272
We're identified as already serviced,
so they seek less familiar females.

393
00:37:17,505 --> 00:37:21,476
-The whole novelty thing?
-Neophilia, to be precise.

394
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:27,115
-What do you think?
-I think it's always about you.

395
00:37:27,382 --> 00:37:31,486
You fall for a guy,
men are worthy of heroic worship.

396
00:37:31,686 --> 00:37:35,123
You're dumped,
they're commitment-phobic asses.

397
00:37:35,323 --> 00:37:40,528
The entire universe doesn't
revolve around your romantic status.

398
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,635
You're in love.

399
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:55,043
-I'm almost in love. Almost.
-Oh, honey, why didn't you tell me?

400
00:37:56,744 --> 00:38:00,782
You're in a spectacular mope.
I didn't want to ruin it.

401
00:38:01,015 --> 00:38:06,588
We met at a work party a couple
of weeks ago. It's just incredible.

402
00:38:06,821 --> 00:38:11,092
And he's so and--
And I'm so and--

403
00:38:11,326 --> 00:38:16,331
I appreciated Liz's intoxication
over her seeming good fortune...

404
00:38:16,564 --> 00:38:19,000
...but I refused to be derailed.

405
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,440
Now armed with my New Cow Theory,
I became voracious for information.

406
00:38:54,235 --> 00:38:57,672
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

407
00:38:58,406 --> 00:39:00,375
-Hey!
-What's this?

408
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:05,046
-"Amygdala, a.k.a. erotic nose-brain."
-Give it back!

409
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,717
"An organ in the nasal cavity
connecting smells to memories.

410
00:39:09,951 --> 00:39:15,056
Banana slugs,
actually hermaphrodites...

411
00:39:15,256 --> 00:39:20,395
...while mating, the males
chew each other's penises off."

412
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:29,170
I worry about you, I really do.

413
00:39:52,594 --> 00:39:58,366
Despite my conviction,
there was the occasional setback.

414
00:39:59,167 --> 00:40:03,104
-I want my erotic nose-brain removed.
-Pardon?

415
00:40:03,338 --> 00:40:08,243
My amygdala, the organ in the
nasal cavity that processes scent...

416
00:40:08,443 --> 00:40:11,980
...which connects to memory.
I'd like it extracted.

417
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,750
Why voluntarily
make yourself anosmatic?

418
00:40:15,984 --> 00:40:20,722
Let me see if I can explain this.
I had this boyfriend.

419
00:40:21,523 --> 00:40:26,394
And he smelled really, really good.
Like soap...

420
00:40:26,628 --> 00:40:29,631
...fresh laundry and vanilla.

421
00:40:30,632 --> 00:40:36,004
Every time I smell those smells,
I'm reminded of how happy we were...

422
00:40:36,237 --> 00:40:40,508
...before he dumped me for no reason.
And I get very sad.

423
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:43,611
Then I get angry,
and before I know it...

424
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:47,315
...I'm in the throes
of an emotional breakdown!

425
00:40:47,582 --> 00:40:53,021
So I was thinking, Doctor Kline,
if I could short-circuit my nose...

426
00:40:53,221 --> 00:40:57,725
...I'd have a chance to live
a seminormal life someday.

427
00:40:59,527 --> 00:41:00,895
Hey, wait!

428
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,309
-Couldn't sleep?
-No.

429
00:41:48,576 --> 00:41:49,944
Me neither.

430
00:41:51,713 --> 00:41:54,949
-This happen to you a lot?
-Yeah.

431
00:41:56,718 --> 00:41:57,986
Me too.

432
00:42:14,802 --> 00:42:17,672
-Just like eating worms.
-Yeah.

433
00:42:24,112 --> 00:42:26,848
Talent. These are good.

434
00:42:27,982 --> 00:42:29,317
Here.

435
00:42:31,753 --> 00:42:33,488
Head back.

436
00:42:41,763 --> 00:42:43,731
-Good.
-Good.

437
00:42:50,205 --> 00:42:52,507
Cold dumplings, my favorite.

438
00:42:53,975 --> 00:42:58,780
-Way to go, Tomcat. Two points.
-Tomcat?

439
00:43:00,114 --> 00:43:03,384
-Cheerleader.
-What?

440
00:43:03,952 --> 00:43:06,421
-I was a cheerleader.
-You were?

441
00:43:06,654 --> 00:43:11,025
Paul G. Blazer High.
Pride and joy of Cincinnati.

442
00:43:11,226 --> 00:43:15,663
-State champs, 1989. Go, Cats.
-Go, Cats.

443
00:43:15,897 --> 00:43:18,199
-Well, show me. Go on.
-No.

444
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:21,569
-Why not?
-I haven't done it in 10 years.

445
00:43:21,836 --> 00:43:25,173
-Show me.
-Do something that merits a cheer.

446
00:43:25,373 --> 00:43:30,912
Like...three dumplings.
Left-handed, in a row.

447
00:43:31,212 --> 00:43:36,117
-You can't do that.
-Deal? Deal.

448
00:43:36,351 --> 00:43:41,789
One. Two. Three. Like that?

449
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:46,661
Come on. Go on. Go on.

450
00:43:46,995 --> 00:43:51,032
-Do you promise not to laugh?
-No. Come on.

451
00:44:01,009 --> 00:44:03,378
-What are those?
-Pom-poms.

452
00:44:07,015 --> 00:44:10,485
-I hate you.
-It's okay.

453
00:44:16,257 --> 00:44:18,526
Ready? Okay.

454
00:44:18,726 --> 00:44:23,031
The Tomcats are here
to show--

455
00:44:31,539 --> 00:44:33,808
Ready? Okay.

456
00:44:34,075 --> 00:44:38,546
The Tomcats are here
to show who's top!

457
00:44:38,813 --> 00:44:43,351
You think you can beat us,
but we can't be stopped!

458
00:44:43,585 --> 00:44:46,087
Go, Tomcats!

459
00:44:47,288 --> 00:44:50,124
-First and ten--
-Eddie?

460
00:44:59,267 --> 00:45:02,070
I'm Jane. Roommate.

461
00:45:02,904 --> 00:45:05,740
-Isabel.
-Nice to meet you.

462
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:10,612
-You can clean up, it's your turn.
-Okay. Good night.

463
00:45:11,279 --> 00:45:13,248
We're a little noisy.

464
00:45:21,956 --> 00:45:24,158
Hi, George, it's Jane--

465
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:32,500
I sensed things were off
when he got back from L.A...

466
00:45:32,767 --> 00:45:38,039
...but I thought he was tired.
Then he says France isn't a good idea.

467
00:45:38,273 --> 00:45:42,277
He'll have to work the whole time.
Still, no big deal.

468
00:45:42,544 --> 00:45:47,081
So he gets on a plane and goes alone.
Right? Wrong.

469
00:45:47,382 --> 00:45:50,652
An hour ago, I call to say good night.

470
00:45:50,852 --> 00:45:54,155
Guess who answered,
1:00 a.m., Paris time?

471
00:45:54,522 --> 00:45:58,293
-Penelope Pope.
-Who's Penelope Pope?

472
00:45:58,526 --> 00:46:01,963
She's the answer to:
"Who the fuck is this?!"

473
00:46:02,163 --> 00:46:06,067
-Oh, God, Liz, I'm sorry.
-I don't get it!

474
00:46:06,301 --> 00:46:11,539
Why feed me all that romantic crap
if he's just gonna cheat?

475
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:14,909
-Two words: copulatory imperative.
-What?

476
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:18,246
The biological urge to spread seed.

477
00:46:19,581 --> 00:46:22,050
Less than 5% of male animals
are monogamous.

478
00:46:22,317 --> 00:46:26,988
-The other 95% are....
-Plugging Penelope Pope.

479
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:42,704
I stopped by H and H
and picked up...

480
00:46:42,904 --> 00:46:48,676
...a sesame seed bagel,
lightly toasted, just like you liked.

481
00:47:04,259 --> 00:47:10,932
I hope Ray's cold turns into pneumonia
and bed rest causes abs to atrophy.

482
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:21,276
Ben wants a women's column. It hit
him, 20% of our readers are female.

483
00:47:21,476 --> 00:47:24,012
The idea is for it to be about men.

484
00:47:24,245 --> 00:47:28,183
How they're paranoid
about going bald and what not.

485
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:30,185
-So?
-Forget baldness.

486
00:47:30,385 --> 00:47:34,489
The real issue is their behavior,
their copulatory impulse.

487
00:47:34,756 --> 00:47:40,395
-Imperative. More hot water, please.
-I think you should write it.

488
00:47:40,628 --> 00:47:43,097
-Are you crazy?
-Well, why not?

489
00:47:43,298 --> 00:47:48,636
-I'm not a writer or a psychologist.
-So? We need someone with experience.

490
00:47:48,837 --> 00:47:52,073
Liz, I don't know what
I'm talking about.

491
00:47:52,273 --> 00:47:55,977
I just have notebooks
filled with ridiculous facts.

492
00:47:56,177 --> 00:48:02,317
This is not a full-time job.
It's a sick, twisted, pathetic hobby.

493
00:48:02,584 --> 00:48:05,920
So get paid to write
about your obsession.

494
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:09,023
If you want,
we'll give you a pen name.

495
00:48:09,257 --> 00:48:16,130
It'd be cathartic for you. Do your
dear, sweet friend a huge favor.

496
00:48:18,867 --> 00:48:20,602
Pen name, huh?

497
00:48:26,708 --> 00:48:30,745
-I'm doing this once. One time.
-Fine. It'll be fun.

498
00:48:30,979 --> 00:48:35,383
I'm concocting the background
of a nonexistent scientist...

499
00:48:35,617 --> 00:48:40,355
...about to publish her delusional
theories in a men's magazine.

500
00:48:40,555 --> 00:48:43,024
You're right. This is fun.

501
00:48:43,525 --> 00:48:49,797
Okay, try this. Born in Sussex, 1937.

502
00:48:51,132 --> 00:48:57,405
Cofounder of the Institute of
Pathological Narcissism in Vienna.

503
00:49:09,817 --> 00:49:11,052
Who is she?

504
00:49:11,252 --> 00:49:15,557
The recently deceased Harriet Gould.
No surviving relatives.

505
00:49:15,757 --> 00:49:19,794
-She's perfect. She even has a bun.
-That's her.

506
00:49:20,562 --> 00:49:25,433
Dr. Marie Charles. Oh, my God.

507
00:49:58,933 --> 00:50:04,072
Every bull begins a relationship
with aces up his sleeve.

508
00:50:04,305 --> 00:50:08,643
Tools of seduction
by which he lures a New Cow.

509
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:13,648
One of the most notorious examples
is the Current Cow Sob Story.

510
00:50:13,882 --> 00:50:17,385
Allow me to deconstruct
the essential elements:

511
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:22,891
You're so easy to talk to.
Not like my Current Cow.

512
00:50:23,091 --> 00:50:25,460
The Myth of Male Shyness:

513
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:29,597
You think he's flattering you?
He's flattering himself.

514
00:50:29,797 --> 00:50:33,001
Showing how sensitive
and honest he is.

515
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:43,244
I just try so hard. I'm sure she
doesn't mean to be a Cold Cow.

516
00:50:43,444 --> 00:50:46,748
In case you think he's
a cold-hearted womanizer...

517
00:50:46,948 --> 00:50:51,286
...he'll say this to show he's
leaving his Cow for a reason...

518
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:54,956
...and he's tormented
by the thought of leaving her.

519
00:50:55,156 --> 00:50:58,526
What do they say about
the love of a good woman?

520
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:03,264
That, once offered, it'll
come back and bite her in the ass.

521
00:51:03,498 --> 00:51:05,133
Enter: case in point.

522
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:09,771
-You're not with what's-her-name?
-Didn't work out.

523
00:51:10,004 --> 00:51:15,944
Get a little saddle sore on your
white horse? So, what happened?

524
00:51:16,177 --> 00:51:22,050
-Lost interest.
-What do you mean? How exactly?

525
00:51:22,684 --> 00:51:26,120
Do we really have to have
another postmortem?

526
00:51:26,354 --> 00:51:32,360
I'm just curious is all. So you went
to a movie? Then back to her place?

527
00:51:33,328 --> 00:51:34,696
Then what?

528
00:51:35,697 --> 00:51:39,367
We're in the kitchen,
and she's looking for food.

529
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:43,738
We'd had dinner after the movie,
but she's still hungry.

530
00:51:43,972 --> 00:51:49,744
-She's always hungry, it seems.
-And that's bad? Women who eat?

531
00:51:53,348 --> 00:51:59,320
You're in the kitchen, she's hungry
again, inexplicably. Then what?

532
00:51:59,854 --> 00:52:02,991
So she takes out
a pint of Häagen-Dazs...

533
00:52:03,491 --> 00:52:07,896
...then starts eating it, standing
there, out of the container.

534
00:52:08,096 --> 00:52:12,901
-Something about it turned me off.
-Was the refrigerator door open?

535
00:52:13,101 --> 00:52:15,837
-Why?
-Answer the question.

536
00:52:16,037 --> 00:52:20,375
-It was open, I think.
-Would it matter if it were shut?

537
00:52:20,575 --> 00:52:25,380
Would that have made a nonfat woman
eating ice cream less revolting?

538
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:31,519
What if she were hungry before shoving
her face into a trough of Häagen-Dazs?

539
00:52:31,753 --> 00:52:34,122
Is using a dish less repulsive?

540
00:52:34,355 --> 00:52:38,526
-Good night, you psycho!
-Good night, you neophiliac!

541
00:52:43,464 --> 00:52:48,036
You sitting down?
Oprah read the article on her show.

542
00:52:48,303 --> 00:52:53,141
The audience loved it. She's begging
for Dr. Charles to be a guest!

543
00:52:53,374 --> 00:52:55,877
Everyone in PR has a different story.

544
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:59,380
She's in Hong Kong,
she's in Tangiers....

545
00:52:59,614 --> 00:53:02,684
-This is bad.
-No, this is all good.

546
00:53:02,951 --> 00:53:07,922
Trust me. I've got it under control.
This won't come anywhere near you.

547
00:53:08,156 --> 00:53:10,625
"While the male may seem shy...

548
00:53:10,959 --> 00:53:15,730
...with his Uriah Heep hand-wringing
and 'Aw, shucks' toe-kicking...

549
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:20,902
...he is actually a narcissist
because this apparent shyness...

550
00:53:21,135 --> 00:53:24,072
...belies the more
deeply rooted feelings...

551
00:53:24,272 --> 00:53:27,942
...of unworthiness
and fear of rejection.

552
00:53:28,142 --> 00:53:32,347
And this is what compels him
to constantly seek attention...

553
00:53:32,614 --> 00:53:38,119
...from New Cow after New Cow,
ad nauseam, ad infinitum."

554
00:53:38,419 --> 00:53:40,488
This is such great stuff.

555
00:53:40,755 --> 00:53:45,994
It destroys any sentimentality we have
about what noble creatures men are.

556
00:53:46,194 --> 00:53:50,532
Here's what we're looking for.
It's provocative, it's clever.

557
00:53:50,765 --> 00:53:52,800
It's got mass appeal.

558
00:53:53,034 --> 00:53:58,072
But nobody can find this woman.
The Today Show's tried, Oprah's tried.

559
00:53:58,506 --> 00:54:01,142
-And have you tried?
-Eddie?

560
00:54:01,376 --> 00:54:06,915
-Well, no.
-Do you know what we're talking about?

561
00:54:08,149 --> 00:54:12,587
-The "ungettable get."
-Yes! I don't care what it takes.

562
00:54:12,854 --> 00:54:17,992
You find that Dr. Marie Charles
and bring her to my studio.

563
00:54:18,193 --> 00:54:22,864
Your friend works at M, and she has
no idea where the doctor is?

564
00:54:23,131 --> 00:54:25,834
-That's what she said.
-I don't buy that.

565
00:54:26,034 --> 00:54:28,903
-Why are you holding out on me?
-I'm not.

566
00:54:29,204 --> 00:54:31,172
-Give me her number.
-No.

567
00:54:31,406 --> 00:54:35,310
Besides, you'd never reach her.
She's at Jivamukti.

568
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:37,212
-Yoga.
-Yoga what?

569
00:54:37,478 --> 00:54:39,447
Jivamukti.

570
00:54:42,851 --> 00:54:45,820
-Manhattan. Jivamukti.
-Eddie!

571
00:54:46,087 --> 00:54:51,159
-It's a yoga place.
-Eddie, don't be a jerk.

572
00:54:55,563 --> 00:54:59,767
Eddie, come on, this is so ridiculous.

573
00:55:00,001 --> 00:55:03,438
You have to leave your shoes in here.

574
00:55:06,574 --> 00:55:09,444
Liz? Excuse me, is--?

575
00:55:11,012 --> 00:55:15,917
Jerk, she's my best friend.
I'd know if there's anything going--

576
00:55:17,752 --> 00:55:19,320
Stay!

577
00:55:19,787 --> 00:55:23,024
Bring your leg up.
Sir, you have to leave.

578
00:55:23,224 --> 00:55:27,195
Sorry. I'm just looking
for a friend. Oh, God!

579
00:55:29,364 --> 00:55:31,533
-You okay?
-Eddie.

580
00:55:35,236 --> 00:55:37,238
How you doing, Becca?

581
00:55:38,573 --> 00:55:39,941
I'm good.

582
00:55:42,477 --> 00:55:44,579
What are you doing here?

583
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,785
I don't know.

584
00:55:51,319 --> 00:55:55,356
Forget about this disturbance.
It's okay.

585
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:59,527
Get back to your spaces
and prepare for lion pose.

586
00:55:59,894 --> 00:56:04,365
Inhale, exhale, open your mouths,
stick out your tongue.

587
00:56:04,632 --> 00:56:08,069
That was Rebecca?
Eddie, talk to me.

588
00:56:08,303 --> 00:56:11,639
There's nothing to talk about.
Hi, Liz.

589
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,808
You cannot believe.

590
00:56:14,509 --> 00:56:16,578
-Janie!
-Hi, guys.

591
00:56:16,845 --> 00:56:19,914
Eddie, this is Alice and Stephen.

592
00:56:20,148 --> 00:56:22,917
-You're Eddie?
-Yeah.

593
00:56:23,918 --> 00:56:28,623
-Are you taking yoga together?
-We were-- It's stupid.

594
00:56:28,823 --> 00:56:33,261
-We don't think it's stupid.
-We started a pregnancy class.

595
00:56:33,494 --> 00:56:36,197
-Congratulations.
-She's a great breather.

596
00:56:36,431 --> 00:56:40,602
-Listen, I gotta go.
-It was really nice to meet you.

597
00:57:19,407 --> 00:57:22,610
Eddie preferred
to leave things unsaid...

598
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:26,781
...and went back to grazing
in greener pastures.

599
00:57:31,653 --> 00:57:35,323
Merry Christmas, everyone.
Merry Christmas.

600
00:57:35,557 --> 00:57:38,560
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

601
00:57:41,229 --> 00:57:43,731
-Two champagnes, please.
-Yes, sir.

602
00:57:43,998 --> 00:57:48,269
Shouldn't that be a champagne
and a Shirley Temple? Sorry.

603
00:57:48,503 --> 00:57:52,373
-No, you're not.
-So where'd you meet her?

604
00:57:52,607 --> 00:57:58,413
-She's Emily's roommate.
-I made coffee for Emily last Sunday.

605
00:58:00,515 --> 00:58:06,020
-Isn't that complicated?
-It's never complicated, Jane.

606
00:58:06,354 --> 00:58:09,557
-Thank you.
-Blintzes, not Blitzen.

607
00:58:25,306 --> 00:58:29,711
-Good evening. What can I get you?
-Scotch, please.

608
00:58:31,279 --> 00:58:34,082
Hear Diane's joke
about the reindeer?

609
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:37,485
Funny!

610
00:58:42,056 --> 00:58:44,092
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

611
00:58:53,234 --> 00:58:55,136
I miss you, Jane.

612
00:59:02,644 --> 00:59:05,813
Am I supposed to walk away now?

613
00:59:13,421 --> 00:59:16,858
Can we get away from this?
Can we do something?

614
00:59:17,091 --> 00:59:20,828
Get together for lunch, dinner.
Friday night?

615
00:59:22,697 --> 00:59:28,703
-Friday is New Year's Eve.
-Oh. That's right. That's right.

616
00:59:28,937 --> 00:59:31,873
-You probably have plans.
-Don't you?

617
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:36,044
Yeah. Yes, I do.
Yes, I do. I--

618
00:59:44,118 --> 00:59:45,954
I have none.

619
00:59:47,989 --> 00:59:51,426
Could I call you?
Would that be okay?

620
00:59:59,868 --> 01:00:01,836
Merry Christmas, Jane.

621
01:00:08,376 --> 01:00:13,414
You can't stop now. You're syndicated
in over 300 newspapers.

622
01:00:13,648 --> 01:00:16,050
Talk radio's having a field day.

623
01:00:16,251 --> 01:00:20,688
-The world's one giant Used Cow lot.
-I want to think about it.

624
01:00:20,922 --> 01:00:25,393
Think? You don't want to be
a post feminist icon?

625
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:29,397
Let's get something great to wear
for Julian's party.

626
01:00:31,165 --> 01:00:35,503
I meant to tell you that
I kind of made other plans.

627
01:00:35,703 --> 01:00:40,375
-It's nothing major--
-What are you talking about?

628
01:00:41,209 --> 01:00:43,945
-Ray asked me out.
-Ray?

629
01:00:45,346 --> 01:00:49,817
As in Ray Brown?
As in devil incarnate?

630
01:00:50,118 --> 01:00:54,255
No! No, I forbid it!
I thought you were over this.

631
01:00:54,722 --> 01:00:57,192
I'm having second thoughts.

632
01:00:57,725 --> 01:01:02,330
Oh, so now Dr. Charles
is having them too.

633
01:01:12,907 --> 01:01:15,777
-Done yet?
-You got a hot date?

634
01:01:15,977 --> 01:01:18,880
-No, I just have to pee.
-Be my guest.

635
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:23,484
-What's this? Party Viagra?
-No. It's nicotine gum.

636
01:01:23,718 --> 01:01:27,689
-When did you quit?
-Daphne wants to marry a smoker.

637
01:01:27,922 --> 01:01:29,290
Here.

638
01:01:30,491 --> 01:01:31,793
Thank you.

639
01:01:32,627 --> 01:01:36,598
-Come out with me tonight.
-To trail after your harem?

640
01:01:36,931 --> 01:01:40,301
I'm flying solo
to keep my options open.

641
01:01:41,236 --> 01:01:43,438
Although that may be for me.

642
01:01:46,307 --> 01:01:48,910
-Hello.
-Have you come to your senses?

643
01:01:49,143 --> 01:01:51,946
No. Quit worrying about me.

644
01:01:52,146 --> 01:01:55,950
Have a good time.
I'll wear the lipstick you gave me.

645
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:57,952
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

646
01:02:04,626 --> 01:02:06,861
Why are you doing this?

647
01:02:08,329 --> 01:02:09,597
Doing what?

648
01:02:10,465 --> 01:02:14,202
-Ray.
-What are you talking about?

649
01:02:17,939 --> 01:02:20,642
If you change your mind,
I'll be here.

650
01:02:20,842 --> 01:02:25,013
Thanks. I think I'll just
jump into my P.J.s...

651
01:02:25,213 --> 01:02:29,150
...probably watch a little TV,
go to bed early.

652
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:31,786
-Happy New Year.
-Same to you.

653
01:02:52,507 --> 01:02:57,145
Back to our special New Year's Eve
coverage with Hugh Downs.

654
01:02:57,345 --> 01:03:00,849
It was less than 48 hours ago
that Ray Brown called...

655
01:03:01,082 --> 01:03:04,452
...to confirm plans
with Jane Goodale tonight...

656
01:03:04,652 --> 01:03:09,657
...a clear indication he regretted
terminating their involvement.

657
01:03:09,891 --> 01:03:13,828
So the question remains:
Why hasn't he shown up yet?

658
01:03:14,062 --> 01:03:19,767
It appears that Mr. Brown is sticking
firmly to his September sanctions.

659
01:04:21,129 --> 01:04:26,067
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

660
01:04:26,301 --> 01:04:31,940
...six, five, four, three, two, one!

661
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:33,842
Happy New Year!

662
01:05:14,115 --> 01:05:15,350
Jane!

663
01:05:38,473 --> 01:05:40,141
Sorry.

664
01:05:40,542 --> 01:05:42,810
-Jane?
-Don't even bother.

665
01:05:43,845 --> 01:05:46,014
I need to talk to you.

666
01:05:47,315 --> 01:05:52,253
-Why didn't you return my calls?
-After the one you didn't make?

667
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,356
-It's not true.
-It's so true.

668
01:06:02,063 --> 01:06:04,132
Stop for a moment.

669
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,403
-I know it's inexcusable.
-Good morning.

670
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:11,706
-There's a reason I didn't go.
-I'm sure.

671
01:06:12,006 --> 01:06:17,879
-I don't care, so forget about it.
-Will you hear me out?

672
01:06:18,112 --> 01:06:21,449
You know what, Ray?
The truth is-- Hi.

673
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:26,754
You did me a favor.
Any delusions I had are gone now.

674
01:06:26,955 --> 01:06:31,860
You released me. For the first
time in months, I feel great.

675
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:35,997
-Staff meeting in two minutes.
-Be right there.

676
01:06:39,234 --> 01:06:40,969
What's wrong?

677
01:06:43,137 --> 01:06:45,206
Diane's wearing your shirt.

678
01:06:46,241 --> 01:06:49,110
The one I bought you
on the sidewalk.

679
01:06:54,649 --> 01:07:00,922
-So, are the two of you...?
-We're seeing each other again, yes.

680
01:07:01,422 --> 01:07:04,125
-I'm trying to explain.
-Wait. Stop.

681
01:07:05,059 --> 01:07:08,062
Did you say "again"?

682
01:07:08,663 --> 01:07:12,800
I should've told you, but Diane
insisted on keeping it quiet.

683
01:07:13,001 --> 01:07:16,337
We got back together
and went away for a while.

684
01:07:16,604 --> 01:07:19,007
It's terrible that I didn't call--

685
01:07:19,274 --> 01:07:22,110
Ray, I got Tony Robbins
on line three.

686
01:07:23,144 --> 01:07:26,147
-Go on.
-I'm really sorry, Jane.

687
01:07:47,101 --> 01:07:49,170
Hey, what is it?

688
01:07:49,938 --> 01:07:52,774
-She's Dee.
-I'm not following.

689
01:07:53,041 --> 01:07:58,379
-Diane is Dee.
-Yes, "D" is for Diane, "E" for Eddie.

690
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:03,184
Ray's Dee. She's the one.
I mean, she was the one, she is....

691
01:08:03,885 --> 01:08:07,856
Whoa, whoa. Just breathe.
Breathe, Jane.

692
01:08:08,122 --> 01:08:11,693
-Ray and Diane are together?
-Back together, again.

693
01:08:12,026 --> 01:08:14,896
I get it. Let it go.
Ray and Diane?

694
01:08:15,196 --> 01:08:17,632
-Yeah!
-Okay, it doesn't matter.

695
01:08:17,866 --> 01:08:21,703
That chapter's over.
We gotta go, so pull it together.

696
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:24,405
Do you hear me?
Don't cry.

697
01:08:24,806 --> 01:08:27,275
-Please. You'll be fine.
-Okay.

698
01:08:27,542 --> 01:08:29,978
-We're going in. Good.
-Okay.

699
01:08:30,211 --> 01:08:32,013
You all right?

700
01:08:34,048 --> 01:08:37,018
Jane, where are we for next week?

701
01:08:37,719 --> 01:08:41,022
We're set with Gérard Depardieu.
Right, Jane?

702
01:08:41,322 --> 01:08:44,559
Oh, good. New movie?

703
01:08:45,059 --> 01:08:48,930
Amazing. I actually....
I saw it.

704
01:08:49,163 --> 01:08:54,669
It's about a man whose marriage
falls apart. It's brutal.

705
01:08:54,936 --> 01:09:00,742
You see the love story first.
This woman means everything to him.

706
01:09:01,009 --> 01:09:07,282
In fact, there's this scene where he
actually sits in just a dark--

707
01:09:08,116 --> 01:09:11,753
It's very touching.
He sits in a dark room and just--

708
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:17,392
You just start to see the tears
and stuff. The man is completely...

709
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:22,030
...broken and you really feel it.
It's devastating.

710
01:09:24,732 --> 01:09:26,401
Is this a joke?

711
01:09:29,070 --> 01:09:30,738
No, what do you mean?

712
01:09:33,641 --> 01:09:36,811
I mean, is this a joke?

713
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:40,448
No, I saw it two nights ago.

714
01:09:41,049 --> 01:09:45,753
-What's so funny, Jane?
-Can you believe this guy?

715
01:09:45,987 --> 01:09:47,956
So sensitive...

716
01:09:48,156 --> 01:09:52,060
...so devastated over
some chubby French guy.

717
01:09:52,293 --> 01:09:55,096
But stomp on somebody's real heart...

718
01:09:55,396 --> 01:09:57,899
...and where's his pity then?
Nowhere.

719
01:09:58,266 --> 01:10:00,001
Why? He doesn't get it!

720
01:10:00,735 --> 01:10:04,572
He never gets it!
Someone explain it to me.

721
01:10:04,939 --> 01:10:08,776
Because I don't know what
you are talking about!

722
01:10:17,252 --> 01:10:18,753
Evelyn, is she free?

723
01:10:18,987 --> 01:10:22,257
-Yeah, she is.
-Thanks.

724
01:10:31,432 --> 01:10:35,103
I'm sorry, Diane.
I don't know where that came from.

725
01:10:35,703 --> 01:10:38,606
I know exactly
where it came from.

726
01:10:39,641 --> 01:10:43,144
-You do?
-Some guy crushed you...

727
01:10:43,444 --> 01:10:48,950
...and you lashed out at poor Ray as
being representative of him.

728
01:10:49,184 --> 01:10:52,487
-I'm right, aren't I?
-More or less.

729
01:10:52,954 --> 01:10:57,425
-Despite the hurt, you can't do it.
-I know.

730
01:10:57,725 --> 01:11:00,795
No, you don't know.
Sit and listen to me.

731
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,902
I'm gonna let you
in on a secret.

732
01:11:09,571 --> 01:11:14,375
About six months ago,
my boyfriend tried to leave me.

733
01:11:15,043 --> 01:11:21,316
Well, he did, he left.
I was devastated. I was destroyed.

734
01:11:21,716 --> 01:11:23,351
Did you see it?

735
01:11:25,587 --> 01:11:29,490
-No, I didn't.
-Right.

736
01:11:29,724 --> 01:11:35,997
Know why? Because if I fall apart,
everything around me falls apart.

737
01:11:36,564 --> 01:11:41,069
Everything that I have worked
my entire life for.

738
01:11:41,402 --> 01:11:44,005
-Do you love him?
-Who?

739
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:45,740
Him. The guy.

740
01:11:47,542 --> 01:11:51,913
-I don't know.
-Yes, you do. Have you talked to him?

741
01:11:53,047 --> 01:11:55,884
Well, no, not exactly talked.

742
01:11:56,551 --> 01:11:59,854
Do it. Do it.
Talk to him.

743
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:06,961
I used to feel that if I
kept my heart to myself...

744
01:12:07,228 --> 01:12:10,265
...if I never expressed
how much I needed him...

745
01:12:10,565 --> 01:12:14,602
...he would never leave me.
Well, guess what? He did.

746
01:12:14,903 --> 01:12:19,507
And I lived in a private,
pathetic puddle.

747
01:12:19,874 --> 01:12:23,077
Until I couldn't stand it.
You know what I did?

748
01:12:23,311 --> 01:12:29,484
I went to him with two corned beef
sandwiches on rye, lightly toasted.

749
01:12:30,385 --> 01:12:33,721
And I told him that
I was lost without him.

750
01:12:34,422 --> 01:12:36,524
You said that?

751
01:12:37,091 --> 01:12:39,894
Pretty progressive, huh?
And I'm happy.

752
01:12:40,128 --> 01:12:41,996
Never thought I'd be happy.

753
01:12:47,669 --> 01:12:52,507
And you believe her? This is love?
What we should all be looking for?

754
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:55,210
That is so tragic.

755
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:59,981
Her boyfriend was screwing you
in order to get away from her...

756
01:13:00,315 --> 01:13:05,320
...and she's the authority on romance?
She has to believe that crap.

757
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:07,155
She's an Old Cow.

758
01:13:08,356 --> 01:13:11,326
All we need to do is
adjust our radar a bit.

759
01:13:11,593 --> 01:13:14,996
Learn to be attracted to
men who don't attract us.

760
01:13:15,196 --> 01:13:18,032
Hang on.
What are you talking about?

761
01:13:18,366 --> 01:13:20,935
Well, for example, normally...

762
01:13:21,703 --> 01:13:25,540
...I'd be attracted to you.
But thanks to Dr. Charles...

763
01:13:25,773 --> 01:13:30,445
...I've learned to control
my passion for testosterone.

764
01:13:30,678 --> 01:13:34,949
And now I'm proud to say
I don't find you attractive at all.

765
01:13:35,216 --> 01:13:37,018
Well, gee, that's swell.

766
01:13:38,553 --> 01:13:40,388
I need a drink.

767
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:46,661
-Does she know she's insane?
-No, she's right.

768
01:13:46,961 --> 01:13:51,833
-Ray cannot go back to an Old Cow.
-Okay, that's it.

769
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:56,638
Jane, these are people, not cows.

770
01:14:08,483 --> 01:14:09,984
Hello?

771
01:14:16,891 --> 01:14:20,461
-I knew you'd take his side.
-This isn't about sides.

772
01:14:20,728 --> 01:14:23,665
It's about reality.
You need to get a grip.

773
01:14:23,898 --> 01:14:28,736
That's rich, coming from an emotional
moron whoring through Manhattan...

774
01:14:29,003 --> 01:14:32,340
-...using women like ATM machines.
-Great.

775
01:14:32,574 --> 01:14:34,909
So I'm a moron for sleeping around.

776
01:14:35,176 --> 01:14:40,048
You, you get dumped and become the
disciple of some crone scientist...

777
01:14:40,281 --> 01:14:43,251
...who can't distinguish
humans from animals.

778
01:14:43,451 --> 01:14:47,722
-She is not a crone!
-Who gives a shit?!

779
01:14:48,389 --> 01:14:54,429
While you were buying these theories
about why guys don't come back...

780
01:14:54,729 --> 01:14:56,898
...you were hoping Ray would.

781
01:14:57,198 --> 01:15:00,835
Men are scum, but please, Ray,
make a liar out of me.

782
01:15:01,102 --> 01:15:07,475
Well, you got what you asked for.
He went back, but with the wrong girl.

783
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:11,412
It's over. Over.

784
01:15:13,147 --> 01:15:14,949
-Why not let go?
-Because.

785
01:15:15,216 --> 01:15:18,052
-Because why?
-Because I can't.

786
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:21,256
-Why?
-Because I was happy!

787
01:15:21,489 --> 01:15:26,060
Because if the theory is wrong,
men don't leave all women, Eddie...

788
01:15:26,327 --> 01:15:28,663
...they leave me.

789
01:15:35,303 --> 01:15:38,606
I know what it does to you.
I know.

790
01:15:39,073 --> 01:15:42,243
Maybe that's why
we hold on so hard.

791
01:15:43,178 --> 01:15:47,982
We can't believe that such a miracle
can happen twice.

792
01:15:51,853 --> 01:15:53,655
But it can.

793
01:15:56,925 --> 01:16:01,362
Someday you'll find it again.
I promise you.

794
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:06,768
-Look at me, I'm a mess.
-I'm looking at you.

795
01:16:10,038 --> 01:16:11,973
And you're beautiful.

796
01:16:14,475 --> 01:16:16,778
You are beautiful.

797
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,915
You're intelligent...

798
01:16:21,983 --> 01:16:24,686
...and real.

799
01:16:28,957 --> 01:16:32,727
And Ray's not the last man
you'll ever love.

800
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:44,672
I promise you he's not.

801
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:40,455
Listen....

802
01:18:44,125 --> 01:18:45,293
No, no, no.

803
01:18:47,629 --> 01:18:52,100
-You're not gonna analyze this one.
-I'm not?

804
01:18:52,767 --> 01:18:54,402
No, no.

805
01:18:55,470 --> 01:18:59,207
You want things to fit so much
that you miss the fun.

806
01:19:02,877 --> 01:19:08,716
You're rationalizing last night.
Worried about what might've happened.

807
01:19:08,983 --> 01:19:13,621
I get a kick out of spending
an entire night with you in my arms...

808
01:19:13,955 --> 01:19:16,858
...without copping a feel.

809
01:19:21,362 --> 01:19:25,200
Well...maybe one.

810
01:19:32,073 --> 01:19:36,978
-What?
-Well, I'm relieved.

811
01:19:39,013 --> 01:19:41,115
I mean, for a second l--

812
01:19:42,183 --> 01:19:45,553
I thought maybe you
thought last night was....

813
01:19:46,921 --> 01:19:48,690
Or that you would...

814
01:19:49,691 --> 01:19:51,192
...think....

815
01:19:52,994 --> 01:19:56,831
That would've blown Dr. Charles
out of the water, huh?

816
01:19:58,233 --> 01:20:02,604
Temporarily, maybe. But you'd
show your spots eventually.

817
01:20:03,438 --> 01:20:04,973
My spots?

818
01:20:05,607 --> 01:20:10,445
Come on, Eddie. Men never fail to do
what's in their nature to do.

819
01:20:14,849 --> 01:20:17,385
And what is that, Jane?

820
01:20:18,786 --> 01:20:21,589
Disappoint you?
Abandon you?

821
01:20:25,593 --> 01:20:28,263
What's really behind these theories?

822
01:20:30,198 --> 01:20:31,833
What are you hiding?

823
01:20:32,901 --> 01:20:34,502
Nothing.

824
01:20:37,972 --> 01:20:40,108
What you see is what you get.

825
01:20:41,709 --> 01:20:43,211
Is it?

826
01:20:46,648 --> 01:20:50,752
This is not about my nature.
This is about yours.

827
01:21:06,768 --> 01:21:08,303
-Hello.
-Janie?

828
01:21:08,636 --> 01:21:12,640
-Stephen, can I call you back?
-Your sister's in the hospital.

829
01:21:12,907 --> 01:21:15,376
We lost the baby, kiddo.

830
01:21:23,685 --> 01:21:26,020
Hey, Janie.

831
01:21:39,601 --> 01:21:41,469
Did you see Stephen?

832
01:21:42,604 --> 01:21:46,040
-I saw him in the hallway--
-Getting ice.

833
01:21:48,476 --> 01:21:49,978
God love him.

834
01:21:50,979 --> 01:21:53,848
They break so easily, don't they?

835
01:22:02,223 --> 01:22:08,062
Last weekend, he woke up in a panic.
He said he had to shop for the baby.

836
01:22:08,496 --> 01:22:12,333
You know how anal he is,
I thought he'd come back with...

837
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:16,371
...thermometers and baby blankets
and safety gates.

838
01:22:17,138 --> 01:22:21,576
But when he walked in the door,
all he had was a little tiny bag.

839
01:22:21,876 --> 01:22:23,811
Inside was this...

840
01:22:26,181 --> 01:22:29,017
...this perfect little baseball mitt.

841
01:22:38,426 --> 01:22:42,864
He got it in his head
that it was gonna be a boy.

842
01:22:43,097 --> 01:22:44,732
Jane.

843
01:22:54,108 --> 01:22:56,444
Okay, I've got ice.

844
01:22:56,711 --> 01:23:01,115
I've got blankets.
I've got magazines.

845
01:23:09,691 --> 01:23:11,426
Look at my wife.

846
01:23:15,563 --> 01:23:18,700
Have you ever seen anyone
more beautiful?

847
01:23:19,534 --> 01:23:21,769
You're nuts.

848
01:23:53,835 --> 01:23:55,937
Diane, it's Jane.

849
01:23:57,605 --> 01:23:59,941
I've found Dr. Charles.

850
01:24:05,847 --> 01:24:08,449
Everybody ready to have a good time?

851
01:24:09,984 --> 01:24:12,554
You'll have to do better than that.

852
01:24:14,289 --> 01:24:17,692
Let me explain how this show's
gonna work, okay?

853
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:21,129
Ray, do we have her on the line?

854
01:24:21,863 --> 01:24:24,966
Two minutes.
Magazine's putting her through.

855
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:26,901
Two minutes.

856
01:24:27,802 --> 01:24:29,938
Diane, two minutes.

857
01:24:30,271 --> 01:24:34,209
So Diane's gonna come out
for about a 15-minute segment.

858
01:24:34,475 --> 01:24:39,080
The first interview's by telephone.
Dr. Marie Charles.

859
01:24:50,792 --> 01:24:54,929
Again, are you absolutely,
100% sure you want to do this?

860
01:24:55,196 --> 01:24:56,965
I'm sure. I'm sorry.

861
01:24:57,198 --> 01:25:00,802
-I want to be sure you're not insane.
-Maybe I am.

862
01:25:01,536 --> 01:25:04,472
-Here she is, Ray.
-Dr. Charles.

863
01:25:11,145 --> 01:25:15,483
Welcome. I rarely have the honor
to host such a distinguished...

864
01:25:15,717 --> 01:25:17,519
...and extraordinary guest.

865
01:25:17,719 --> 01:25:22,056
Today, Doctor Marie Charles
speaks out for the first time...

866
01:25:22,357 --> 01:25:26,861
-...since the publication--
-Already 20,000 hits on the web site.

867
01:25:27,929 --> 01:25:31,966
-Holy cow.
-The reclusive doctor has agreed...

868
01:25:32,267 --> 01:25:34,502
...to an exclusive phone interview.

869
01:25:34,736 --> 01:25:39,240
And I consider it a rare gift
from someone whose work...

870
01:25:39,574 --> 01:25:43,945
...has meant a tremendous amount
in my life, as I'm sure yours.

871
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:47,348
Dr. Marie Charles.

872
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:51,719
Hello, Dr. Charles. Are you there?

873
01:25:52,086 --> 01:25:54,455
Hello, Dr. Charles, can you hear me?

874
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:57,559
I'm not getting anything.

875
01:25:59,761 --> 01:26:04,098
-Where the hell is she?
-We have a technical difficulty.

876
01:26:04,399 --> 01:26:06,734
We'll get it worked out.

877
01:26:09,604 --> 01:26:14,042
-Patch it through on another line.
-We only have one dedicated line.

878
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:24,152
-Take us to commercial.
-She's here. She wants to go on.

879
01:26:24,752 --> 01:26:27,422
Hold that, hold that.
She's here.

880
01:26:27,755 --> 01:26:33,561
It seems the reason we've been unable
to get through telephonically...

881
01:26:33,761 --> 01:26:39,367
...is because she's here, having
decided to do the interview in person.

882
01:26:39,634 --> 01:26:43,004
-Holy shit.
-Let's not waste any more time.

883
01:26:43,271 --> 01:26:45,139
Welcome Dr. Marie Charles!

884
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:52,380
-A little makeup. Just a little.
-Stop! Stop!

885
01:26:52,647 --> 01:26:54,749
Show yourself, Dr. Charles.

886
01:26:57,785 --> 01:26:59,387
Wake up!

887
01:27:06,594 --> 01:27:08,730
What? Where's Dr. Charles?

888
01:27:11,666 --> 01:27:15,603
There's no Dr. Charles.
There never was.

889
01:27:19,174 --> 01:27:21,609
I invented her, Diane.

890
01:27:26,181 --> 01:27:29,851
I invented her because
I had something to say.

891
01:27:31,886 --> 01:27:33,988
And somehow I thought...

892
01:27:34,856 --> 01:27:40,995
...if it were coming from a 65-year-
old Ph.D., you'd see it the way I had.

893
01:27:41,229 --> 01:27:46,634
As a truth, as a legitimate,
scientific truth.

894
01:27:47,635 --> 01:27:53,508
But it isn't.
It's completely ridiculous.

895
01:27:56,544 --> 01:28:00,548
I lied to you all, and I lied
to myself because...

896
01:28:01,482 --> 01:28:03,318
...the real truth is...

897
01:28:07,388 --> 01:28:10,725
...that I was heartbroken and lost.

898
01:28:11,559 --> 01:28:14,562
And I just wanted
to understand it somehow.

899
01:28:14,863 --> 01:28:19,234
I wanted it to be about them.

900
01:28:19,667 --> 01:28:23,705
So everything I thought I had figured
out was completely upside-down.

901
01:28:23,938 --> 01:28:28,176
I thought that this bull had gone to a
New Cow, but she was an Old Cow.

902
01:28:28,776 --> 01:28:34,182
What was I talking about?
I was comparing men to animals.

903
01:28:35,083 --> 01:28:38,419
Which, let's face it,
sometimes they are.

904
01:28:40,922 --> 01:28:43,091
But sometimes they are not.

905
01:28:43,958 --> 01:28:49,998
Sometimes you open the barn door,
or the hospital room door...

906
01:28:50,565 --> 01:28:52,534
...or the bedroom door...

907
01:28:55,303 --> 01:29:00,241
...and you find the real thing.
You find a guy who...

908
01:29:02,210 --> 01:29:06,648
...sits with you when you're at
your worst, knee-deep in Kleenex...

909
01:29:06,881 --> 01:29:12,320
...and your face looks like
a punching bag and you're a mess...

910
01:29:14,622 --> 01:29:17,759
...and he can still look at you
and tell you...

911
01:29:18,059 --> 01:29:22,897
...that Ray is not the last man
you're ever going to love.

912
01:29:38,313 --> 01:29:39,914
Eddie.

913
01:29:47,922 --> 01:29:50,291
Jane, you all right?

914
01:30:15,450 --> 01:30:16,951
Eddie!

915
01:30:18,553 --> 01:30:20,088
Eddie!

916
01:30:37,205 --> 01:30:41,276
Eddie! Eddie!
Stop! Stop!

917
01:30:54,822 --> 01:30:57,225
So, what you see is what you get?

918
01:30:59,561 --> 01:31:03,031
Minus a few gray hairs
and a Ph.D., yeah.

919
01:31:06,734 --> 01:31:09,404
I'm really sorry, Eddie.

920
01:31:12,106 --> 01:31:17,378
-You should have told me.
-I should've told you a lot of things.

921
01:31:18,379 --> 01:31:19,914
You were right.

922
01:31:21,516 --> 01:31:23,484
It was about my nature.

923
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:30,792
Of everything you said to me
that night, what scared me most...

924
01:31:32,927 --> 01:31:35,597
...is that I would find it again.

925
01:31:36,931 --> 01:31:38,600
Because I have.

926
01:31:45,106 --> 01:31:47,542
Would you please say something?

927
01:31:51,980 --> 01:31:53,515
No.

928
01:32:15,336 --> 01:32:17,739
So you're saying....

929
01:32:19,607 --> 01:32:21,743
What have we got to lose?

930
01:32:22,510 --> 01:32:27,081
-Everything?
-Exactly.
