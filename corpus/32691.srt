1
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:23,464
You murderers! It's easy
to gun us down! We only got rocks!

2
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,464
H A T E

3
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,618
This film is dedicated
to friends and f amily

4
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,940
who died
while it was in the making.

5
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,906
Heard about the guy
who fell off a skyscraper?

6
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,860
On his way down past each floor,

7
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,339
he kept saying
to reassure himself:

8
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,141
"So far so good...

9
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,701
"so far so good..."

10
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,026
How you fall doesn't matter.

11
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,109
It's how you land!

12
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,827
More rioting in the projects
outside the city.

13
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,901
Last night a mob of youths

14
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,141
attacked a police station

15
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,342
in the Muguet projects.

16
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,388
Pitched battles
left 14 officers injured.

17
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,268
33 arrests were made.

18
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,979
A mall and nearby buildings
were damaged by looters

19
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,381
who dispersed around 4 a.m.

20
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,338
Alleged police brutality
sparked the riots 2 days ago.

21
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,139
A local teen was severely beaten
under questioning.

22
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,823
The officer was suspended.

23
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:06,859
The victim, Abdel lchaha,
is in hospital

24
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,702
in critical condition.

25
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,100
Got a looter under arrest,
a minor.

26
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,343
SA YID: FUCK THE POLICE

27
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,188
Vinz! Where the fuck is he?

28
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,581
- What?
- Whadda ya mean "what"?

29
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,502
Can't fuckin' say hello?

30
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,501
Chill, Sayid. What's up?

31
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,501
Tell your bro to come out.

32
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,740
- What for?
- Tell him!

33
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,185
- What for?
- Just tell him!

34
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,703
What for?

35
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,863
Is this a TV game show?

36
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,498
Quit hollering!

37
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,106
You guys made enough noise
last night!

38
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,269
You see me last night?
I wasn't here.

39
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,499
Shut up!

40
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,228
Don't play dumb!

41
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,585
- You'll burn next, asshole!
- Idiot!

42
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,303
- You gonna get him?
- Don't asshole me, asshole!

43
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,665
You still there? Beat it!

44
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,063
If I wake him,
he'll get mad. You try!

45
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,619
I hope the cops tan your hide!

46
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,104
Vinz...

47
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,139
Shut up, Sayid.

48
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,223
Shut up? Be nice
or you're history, fuckface!

49
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,665
Go away. You stink!

50
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,710
You want to play
this early? One...

51
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,620
Two...

52
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,905
Three.

53
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,859
You lose.

54
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,463
Fuck your sister.

55
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,269
I told you not to talk about her!

56
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,500
She sucks Donald Duck. Get lost!

57
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,307
Jew boy!

58
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,746
You bogus kike, you're nowhere!

59
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,061
- I saw a cow.
- What?

60
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,106
A cow.

61
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,339
Got some smoke?

62
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,863
In the box.

63
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:08,022
Last night, during the riot,
I dashed behind a building:

64
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,704
Wham! I ran right into a cow.

65
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,905
Really?

66
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,420
Stop smoking,
your brain's fried!

67
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,899
Off my bed!
I'll say you're taking drugs!

68
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,425
I'll cut your throat, hang you up,

69
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,184
you'll drown in your blood!

70
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,260
Granma!

71
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,709
Get off the bed.

72
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,425
You get out.

73
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,739
Stay off my bed!

74
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,186
Get lost, you snitch!

75
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,181
Move it.

76
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,466
Watch your mouth with my sister!

77
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,905
- Got any salt?
- Respect your granma!

78
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,185
You my father?

79
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,544
What about Dad?

80
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,270
You my mother now?

81
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,264
Go to school!

82
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,182
It burned down.

83
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,181
Burned down! Savages!

84
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,706
Start that way and soon
you'll skip temple!

85
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,701
- Granma!
- What?

86
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,019
I didn't burn the school!

87
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,909
And you don't go to temple!

88
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,140
You win! I surrender!

89
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,665
If everyone ran from an argument,

90
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,821
there'd be a stampede, already!

91
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,629
But we'd all be going
the same way!

92
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,019
Mazeltov!

93
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,948
You talkin' to me?

94
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,984
You talkin' to me,
mothafucka!

95
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,624
...the guy says: "For cash,
I'd even murder!"

96
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:52,021
He tells his friend:
"I'd even waste you."

97
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,226
The friend freaks,
so the guy says:

98
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,858
"Don't worry, you're a buddy.

99
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,545
"I won't waste you for cash,
I'll do it for free!"

100
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,019
What a killer line! "For free!"

101
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,626
"I'll waste you for free!"
What a line, Vinz!

102
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,825
I got it the first time.

103
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,709
Tell your brother to come see me!

104
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,579
What a killer put-down!
"I'll waste you for free!"

105
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,820
Shut up and gimme the joint.

106
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,422
- A killer line!
- Killer.

107
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:27,505
"I'd waste you for free."
Can't do better than that!

108
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,946
Why you so uptight?

109
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,586
Mothafucka!

110
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,944
Bastards wrecked everything!

111
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,778
Check that!

112
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,906
I don't believe it!

113
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,666
How'd they get the car in?

114
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,947
The doorway's too narrow.

115
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,260
Chill, Sayid! There he is.

116
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,860
He must be pissed off.

117
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:12,864
Took him two years to get this gym!

118
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,066
Your dope's good, Vinz.

119
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,306
Not mine. It's Hubert's.

120
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,226
Don't bogart, Sayid.

121
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,982
Thought you quit smoking?

122
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,503
Me too.

123
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,501
What happened here?

124
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,944
Guess.

125
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,589
A fire?

126
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,105
You win the prize, Einstein!

127
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,703
Kiss mine, cousin!

128
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,225
I knew it'd go up
in smoke one day.

129
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,699
So why'd you bust ass to get it?

130
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,861
'Cause he wanted to, dickface!

131
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,224
You're the dick.

132
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,028
You know who did it?

133
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,902
I don't want to know.

134
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,662
How'd the car get in here?

135
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,420
The doorway's not big enough.

136
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,509
We dissed them, spit on them!

137
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,264
But the cops didn't move an inch.

138
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:31,389
Then the mothers stepped aside
to make a path...

139
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,861
Then these plainclothes pigs
came out with wooden clubs.

140
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,908
They hit a homeboy,
like real bad!

141
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,743
Kept clubbing him
till we tore into 'em.

142
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,186
I kicked a pig right in the head!

143
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,865
That's a Yamaha.

144
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,545
More like your Mom on a Harley!

145
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,349
It's Mohammed's bike.
He fixed the exhaust.

146
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,978
No, it's Vinz's Mom on a Yamaha!

147
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,503
Which Mohammed?

148
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,229
Farida's brother?

149
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,381
Farida with the driver's licence?

150
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,700
No, Farida from the supermarket.

151
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,261
Anyway, it was a scene.

152
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,389
You should've been there Hubert.
It was intense.

153
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,059
Tear gas, 2 nights in a cop shop,

154
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,902
all the fists you can eat,

155
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,742
getting hell at home:

156
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,346
sorry cousin, but I ain't buyin'!

157
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:44,019
Gimme a break! It was war
against the pigs, in living color!

158
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,262
I was trying to make some cash.

159
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,990
Your bogus riot fucked it up!

160
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,663
When a brother goes down,
I stand up!

161
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,062
What brother?
Do I know the guy?

162
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:01,900
I won't take hits for
a homeboy gangsta I don't know.

163
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,139
Let's go.

164
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,389
I mean it!

165
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,188
Abdel's no gangsta.

166
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,025
OK, but I'm not faster
than a speeding bullet!

167
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,379
Hey, hands off the hot dogs!

168
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,539
Gimme one.

169
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,904
And go broke?

170
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,469
Don't make us cry!

171
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,224
I'll make you cry, Sayid!

172
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,387
Everyone pays the same!

173
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,745
Except Hubert, it's his building.

174
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,865
A buck?

175
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,986
A buck for one, OK two!

176
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,983
You're a drag!

177
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,469
You should try one.

178
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,780
- Got a buck?
- Yeah, for me!

179
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:44,587
Here.

180
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,867
No way, I'll remember this!

181
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,702
- So remember.
- Never forget.

182
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,859
Don't be a jerk. I'll pay later.

183
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,904
How? With your sister?

184
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,300
Don't talk that way about her!

185
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,540
Chill out, you bogus Arab!

186
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,668
Sayid!
Come back with that!

187
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,818
Got any change?

188
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,140
We're broke!

189
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,547
- 2 bits.
- We're broke.

190
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,749
...The judge says I go to jail,

191
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,628
or do jobs for the City.

192
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,020
Community service? The pits!

193
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,023
Ever do it? Jail's bad enough!

194
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,942
You'd rather do time?

195
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,743
Your bro stole a dog!

196
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,140
- Liar!
- His mouth is full!

197
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,663
Put it on my tab.

198
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,627
Liar! Your nose is growing!

199
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,187
I'll bust your nose, Sayid!

200
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,138
Beat it!

201
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,142
A .45!

202
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,947
Like the gun in "Lethal Weapon."

203
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:03,989
We saw that movie together!
It was a 9mm. Glock!

204
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,381
- What?
- No, it wasn't!

205
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,586
That was a Desert Eagle.

206
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,462
He shot at the truck!

207
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,780
That wasn't "Lethal Weapon"!

208
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,063
What are you talking about?

209
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,188
A cop lost his handgun
during the riot.

210
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,908
That's a good one!

211
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:29,427
I don't know the pig
who lost his piece.

212
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,583
But I'd like to know
who found it!

213
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,305
No joke!

214
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,303
...l'll sleep, eat, lift weights.

215
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,938
Everyone's been inside, except me.

216
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,185
A month for theft
is pathetic!

217
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,819
Not in your league!

218
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,824
- What league? I was never inside!
- You got nabbed.

219
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:54,939
I quit in time!

220
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:56,940
Come look!

221
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,862
We got visitors.

222
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,066
Over here!

223
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,466
It's the mayor!

224
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,703
Up Your Honor, Mr. Mayor!
Mothafucka!

225
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,342
Cut the stereo!

226
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:16,219
Who's in charge here?
You, Nordeen?

227
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,101
What's going on here?

228
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,420
Think you're in Disneyland?

229
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,707
You're not allowed up here.
You gotta go down.

230
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,098
We're causing no trouble.

231
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:30,104
Still, you've got
to get off the roof.

232
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,828
We like it up here.

233
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,184
Off the roof.

234
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,300
You learn that shit at Notre Dame?

235
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,189
Cut it out! Quiet everyone!

236
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:48,541
- I'll handle this!
- Forget it!

237
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,581
You can't stay here!

238
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,461
So fold your little tents,
grab your chairs...

239
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,303
and let's all go downstairs
nice and easy.

240
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,267
OK!

241
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,500
Who's gonna make us leave?

242
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,662
Your goons or you,
in your little uniform?

243
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,025
Nordeen, we're doing our job.

244
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,783
Leave us alone!

245
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,108
Don't talk to me like that,
I don't know you.

246
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,225
Now get lost!

247
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,664
Sitting duck!

248
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,900
Your mother drinks Bud!

249
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,947
Anyone who wants to stay, stay!
Heat's off.

250
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,829
- I'm staying
- You're going.

251
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,867
Let me stay, Nordeen.

252
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,100
- What did I say?
- You said go.

253
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,147
- So what do you do?
- I go!

254
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,381
OK, I'm going!

255
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,427
Vinz, c'mon!

256
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,622
Don't play tough guy!

257
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,020
You always wimp out!

258
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,782
...You see 'em in porn stores.

259
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,303
What are they called?

260
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,585
G-strings.

261
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,388
- What?
- G-strings, moron.

262
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,984
She had one on, I swear it.

263
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,822
I fucked her like an animal.

264
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,981
We were in the room...

265
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,469
she kept screaming for more.

266
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,066
Guy next door pounded
the wall we were so noisy.

267
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,430
You dreamt you fucked her!

268
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,621
What?

269
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,464
- You know the bitch?
- I know her, she has AIDS.

270
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,190
Get outta here!

271
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,625
- Hi, we're from TV.
- What's this?

272
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,781
Were you in the riot last night?

273
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,463
Did you break things, burn cars?

274
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:51,066
- We look like looters, lady?
- I didn't say that.

275
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,346
- So what do we look like?
- Nothing special.

276
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,149
Get out the car! This ain't Thoiry.

277
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,943
We got work to do.

278
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,500
What kind of work?
Stirring up shit?

279
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,741
- For a juicy scoop!
- No camera!

280
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,947
Quit snooping in the 'hood,
fuckface! Stop taping!

281
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,388
Quit taping, dickhead!

282
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,704
This ain't Thoiry!

283
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,181
What's with all the assholes today?

284
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,023
That fuckin' broad...

285
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,619
What's Thoiry?

286
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,985
A drive-in safari park.

287
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,942
This ain't no zoo!

288
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,221
Open up, WaIMart!

289
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,265
You fuckin' jerks.

290
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,580
Talk nice, we're in France.

291
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,065
It's 1 p.m. and you're in bed?

292
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,986
What's with the hair net?

293
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,988
Lay off!

294
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,865
You a movie star, WaIMart?

295
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,625
What's this shitty TV?

296
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,462
Watch where you sit!

297
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,904
Just sweat pants!

298
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,664
Where's the new TV?

299
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,979
It's too big to move.

300
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,187
I came by for my cash.
Where were you?

301
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,262
I don't have it.

302
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,580
Don't you know what happened?

303
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,979
Go see what your pals did.

304
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,468
Foued's brother did that.

305
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,507
So what?

306
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,626
Give me his address.

307
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:31,021
Look what he did to my car!

308
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,942
Look what he did!

309
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,305
Just look!

310
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,381
Leave that alone.

311
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:41,623
I lost ten grand!
I can't work now.

312
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,623
WaIMart, it's just a car!

313
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,821
That's what you say!

314
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,742
You don't realize.

315
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,946
It's all I got.

316
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,987
Cut it out!

317
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,219
Leave that alone!

318
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,062
A homeboy's dying,
fuck your car!

319
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,620
"A homeboy!"
Big deal!

320
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,469
You disgust me!

321
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,702
That car's all I have.
It's my life!

322
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,863
- They're showing the riot!
- My car's more important!

323
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,258
Look, the riot.

324
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,068
- Some TV!
- Sure, bust it!

325
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:16,381
- Fix the antenna!
- I'm trying!

326
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,306
It's David!

327
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,189
How'd he get on TV?

328
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,989
I was over there,
they missed me!

329
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:25,825
- Fix it! I can't see a thing!
- This TV sucks!

330
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,224
How'd that fucker get on TV?

331
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,385
Hey, gimme my money!

332
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,461
I don't have it. Snoopy has it.

333
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,622
Gimme my coat
and get outta my face!

334
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,746
You guys must be happy.

335
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,378
A cop lost his gun in the riot.

336
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,741
I hope the guy who finds it

337
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,219
uses it uptown, not here for once!

338
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,027
Forget it,

339
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,748
we'll get even!

340
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,990
You know that show,
"Candid Camera"?

341
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:02,905
So this celebrity's sure
he's been set up.

342
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:07,343
His buddy's fixed it
with the camera guys.

343
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,819
The celebrity thinks
they're out to get him.

344
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,504
He always eats
in the same joint.

345
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:15,628
He's sure
they'll film him there.

346
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:19,305
The others convince him
there's a hidden camera.

347
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:22,940
He sees the TV truck,
a camera behind the mirror

348
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,420
and the guy with him
pretends to act weird.

349
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,901
The celebrity thinks
he'll fool 'em,

350
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:33,949
pretending he hasn't noticed.

351
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:37,420
He thinks all hell
will break loose.

352
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:42,106
But they just film him, jumpy,
waiting for shit to happen.

353
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,544
So you see this guy...

354
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,780
Cut it out, Sayid!

355
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,259
- Wasn't me!
- Then who?

356
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:52,582
The celebrity's sweating,
trying to act cool.

357
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,389
Each time the waiter passes

358
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,347
he thinks it'll happen.

359
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:01,185
Then a guy asks him
for his autograph.

360
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,341
The celeb thinks it's a trick

361
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,865
and starts ranting at the guy,

362
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:10,421
who doesn't know what's up,
so he gets mad.

363
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:13,388
They start fighting,

364
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,018
and the Candid Camera guys
have to break it up.

365
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,863
It was a killer punch out.

366
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,504
Then what?

367
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,262
That's all.

368
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,703
Who was the celebrity?

369
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:41,020
Dunno, but he was real famous.

370
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,704
I don't remember.

371
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:00,465
This looks like trouble.
See ya.

372
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,220
WE'RE THE FUTURE

373
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,909
What did they want?

374
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,098
"Don't get mad, get even."

375
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:39,024
It's Abdel's brother.
He's got a pump gun.

376
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,540
Party time!

377
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,665
We go visit Abdel
in the hospital?

378
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,747
I gotta show you something...

379
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:05,429
That's real steel!

380
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,184
- Get a load of it.
- What a mother!

381
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,619
What'll you do with it?

382
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,779
Stop it, Hubert.

383
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:20,905
What you gonna do with it?

384
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,867
Depends if Abdel dies.

385
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,941
You gonna kill a cop?

386
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,668
Best way to get respect!

387
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,344
Smoking a cop
will get you respect?

388
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,466
It'll even up the score.

389
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:34,667
- I coulda got you a piece.
- This one's special.

390
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,429
Think you're on a mission?

391
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,219
Well, I did find the gun.
Leave me alone!

392
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,462
- Will it help Abdel?
- It'll help us.

393
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,105
Stop fronting!

394
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,669
You pussy!

395
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,303
You're headed for big shit!

396
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,142
I'll do my thing, you do yours.

397
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,666
- I don't want to know.
- So don't ask!

398
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,222
One thing's sure...

399
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,548
with that piece
you're the big man.

400
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,187
Hey, wait for me!

401
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,583
Fuck it...

402
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,901
What the fuck ya doin'?

403
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,903
OK, don't have a shit fit!

404
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,068
Sorry, fellas, you can't go in.

405
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,868
Let us in. We came to see Abdel.

406
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,861
Sorry, I have my orders.

407
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:17,420
Just a couple of minutes.
Then we'll leave.

408
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,989
He's our friend.

409
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,867
The docs won't let you in.
He's in a coma.

410
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,588
We won't make trouble!

411
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,101
If I let you in,

412
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,340
- I'll lose my job.
- Sure, flunkey!

413
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,263
Tone it down.
His family's here.

414
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,466
They need peace and quiet!

415
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,861
We're not as good as reporters?

416
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,224
Get going!

417
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,428
Hands off, man!

418
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,266
You gonna make me leave?

419
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,500
Gonna shoot me?
Pull out your pop gun!

420
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,503
What's going on here?

421
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,149
Look at that fuckface!

422
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,584
We came to see our pal Abdel!

423
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,821
We won't leave till we see him.

424
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,901
Beat it, before I take you in.

425
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,139
Oh, yeah?

426
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,538
You shut up!

427
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,460
Move 'em out!

428
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:13,026
We can be nice or nasty.
It's up to you!

429
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,429
Calm down!

430
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:19,424
Lieut., these kids made trouble.

431
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,581
I got the ringleader.

432
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,548
- He did nothing.
- I arrested the leader.

433
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,507
- What leader?
- He means Sayid.

434
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,500
Sure, Uncle Tom!

435
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,706
Things aren't bad enough.

436
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,986
You had to go to the hospital?

437
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,698
They were only doing their job.

438
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,428
Doing their job?

439
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:47,150
Shut your yap, once and for all!

440
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,540
- You shut yours!
- Don't talk to me like that!

441
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:52,304
- Same to you!
- Shut up, will ya!

442
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,619
Shit!

443
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,303
You don't know a fucking thing!

444
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,505
What do you know?

445
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,422
Cut it out, asshole.

446
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,660
- Watch your tongue!
- If you watch yours!

447
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,423
The bastards who beat up Abdel
will go to jail!

448
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,467
You're dreaming.

449
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,428
The cops at the hospital

450
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,501
protect Abdel and his family.

451
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,829
You just fuck things up!

452
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:17,308
You idiot, you got it all wrong.

453
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,902
Those cops
are just protecting Abdel!

454
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:25,139
Most cops don't beat on you.
They protect you!

455
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,660
Who protects us from you?

456
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,228
Never do it again!

457
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,903
Who writes your jokes?

458
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,026
Watch your tongue!

459
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,942
Watch your mother!

460
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,541
You ever trash me again,

461
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,666
you go to central lock-up.

462
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,503
Your brother can bail you out.

463
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:03,184
- I didn't ask no favors.
- I did it for your brother.

464
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,580
He'd rip you apart!

465
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,548
You're the ripper.

466
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:17,579
About the boxing gym:
I can get you a City grant.

467
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,980
You'll get another gym.

468
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:24,386
Kids want to punch
more than bags now!

469
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:28,429
It's hopeless. Once I could talk
to the kids. No more.

470
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:33,345
And they know me!
A rookie cop wouldn't last a month.

471
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:36,024
An Arab in a police station
doesn't last an hour!

472
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:40,548
I have to go.
Try to keep cool.

473
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,224
Yeah, we'll try.

474
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,904
Outta my face, you fucker!

475
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,503
OK!

476
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:50,825
You shook his hand?

477
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:53,106
He's always been cool with me.

478
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,306
You don't shake a pig's hand!

479
00:32:55,470 --> 00:33:00,021
You shoot him, I shake his hand!
You're a fuckin'pain!

480
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,181
And you're out of it!
Look!

481
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,466
I knew it!

482
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,382
You acted so weird
at the hospital.

483
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,381
- Take it easy.
- Let me see.

484
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,219
You didn't tell us?

485
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,463
You didn't want to know!

486
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,461
Packing that!
You retard!

487
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:18,224
I'm a big boy.
Quit preaching!

488
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,268
I'll bust your chops!

489
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,665
Stop it!

490
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:26,379
You feel big with that gun!
I'll kick your ass!

491
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,585
Like how?

492
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,469
Cut it out.
Let's grab a sandwich.

493
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,702
You shut up!

494
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,185
I'm splittin'.

495
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,022
So split!

496
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,622
Stay with us.

497
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,383
Sayid, let him split!

498
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,706
Don't go!

499
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,098
Back off.

500
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,946
What's with him?

501
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,745
Jerk thinks too much.

502
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,186
- Where's Mom?
- Explain this to me.

503
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,227
I can't now.

504
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,104
Well?

505
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,299
What's the answer?

506
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,346
I don't know.

507
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,978
- You never know.
- OK, I never know.

508
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,669
Hi, Mom.

509
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,269
How's the kid brother?

510
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:34,749
He's fine.

511
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:38,221
But your brother
in jail isn't so good.

512
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:39,903
What's with Max?

513
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,186
He needs textbooks.

514
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,749
What for?

515
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:47,585
To get a high school diploma
while he's inside.

516
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,349
He never made grade school!

517
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,706
Hands off the pots!

518
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,778
I didn't do nothing!

519
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:00,345
I dunno how I'll buy his books.

520
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,659
By the way...

521
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,943
There's the money
for the power bill.

522
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,740
- And my machine?
- What machine?

523
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:16,220
My new sewing machine!

524
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:18,984
Shit, I forgot to ask WaIMart.

525
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,744
Mine's ready to croak.

526
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:24,140
Patou, go study in your room.

527
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,870
- Mom.
- Don't argue.

528
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,305
Who's WaIMart?
That fence in Tower B?

529
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,461
No, he's in Tower D.

530
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,188
I don't know him.

531
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,261
Could he get us textbooks?

532
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,102
That's not his line, Mom.

533
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,862
Officials now admit

534
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:43,659
that a policeman lost his gun
in the riot last night.

535
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,821
It is still missing.

536
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:49,903
We asked locals
if a loose gun is dangerous

537
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,186
in this explosive situation...

538
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,539
What a fuck up!

539
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,621
They burned down the gym.

540
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:02,099
I'm sick of the projects.
I want out. It's getting worse.

541
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:05,228
I'm sure Vinz helped
torch the gym.

542
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,739
He's going wild, like Max.

543
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,788
I have to get out.

544
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,343
I have to leave this place.

545
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,986
If you see a grocery,
buy me a lettuce.

546
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,345
No credit for you.

547
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,946
My granma's a regular here!
So I'm 2 bits short!

548
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,348
You're not your granma.

549
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,708
- Hands off!
- Just looking!

550
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,100
- Got two bits?
- How about one?

551
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,340
- One OK?
- One not OK.

552
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:37,342
Gimme a coin, you dinosaur!

553
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,023
No coins for you.

554
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,146
OK... Now what?

555
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:43,266
So what'll it be?

556
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,102
- I saw you!
- You saw what?

557
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,864
Gimme the red peppers.
They're cheaper.

558
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,058
My granma'll kill me!
She hates 'em.

559
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,620
So shoot the Chink,
grab the green peppers!

560
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,667
It'll make granma's day!

561
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,668
Fuck,
fuck the po-lice...

562
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,029
He's intense.

563
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,785
Killer!

564
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,428
A mother killer!

565
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:28,868
Sayid, check out the cow.

566
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,066
Fuck off with your cow!

567
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:33,949
- I swear!
- You said you'd cut my hair.

568
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:36,066
The same cow! I saw it!

569
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,504
You're the cow!

570
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:40,138
It was the same fuckin' cow!

571
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:41,902
You gotta believe me!

572
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,185
Shut up!

573
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:50,301
I'm Señor Duck...

574
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:57,228
I fucka you,
I fucka her, I fucka him...

575
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:00,666
OK Granma!
So they're red peppers!

576
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:04,058
You know this cow business.

577
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,902
It's a weird trip.

578
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:09,506
Don't wreck my hair!

579
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:12,184
I gotta get laid!
So watch it!

580
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,181
I can mow a lawn, I'll try.

581
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:14,987
A lawn?

582
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,106
Sit your ass down.

583
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,827
- It's hot, Vinz
- What?

584
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,742
A cop's piece is hot.

585
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:25,300
You said that already.
Sit still, loser!

586
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,389
I'll whack you.

587
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,308
Don't move.

588
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,541
If Abdel dies, you'll kill?

589
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:34,941
Wanna be the next Arab
iced by the pigs?

590
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:37,021
Well, me neither.

591
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,101
So now you're an Arab!

592
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,306
They think we're full of shit.

593
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:44,462
But I'm not bullshitting
about this, Sayid.

594
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,498
Watch it!

595
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,069
It's cool.

596
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:52,188
Is this gun legit for a cop?
...What'd you do?

597
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,147
Nothing, I swear it!

598
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,585
Why swear?

599
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:57,944
Because it's nothing.

600
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,338
I'm cold there!

601
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,865
It's cold in this room!

602
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:07,142
I'll even it out,
it'll be great!

603
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:09,699
I got a date! Lemme see!

604
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,542
No fuckin' trust!

605
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:13,339
I didn't see!

606
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,704
You didn't look!

607
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,579
Trust me, dammit!

608
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:19,863
It's a nice hole.

609
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,383
A nice what?

610
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:24,428
Trust me, or no haircut!

611
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,949
Look at me, Sayid!

612
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,702
Get outta here!

613
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:32,508
Don't get bummed out!

614
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:36,100
It's the style in New York.

615
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:39,023
The killer cut, so stop whining!

616
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,066
New York?

617
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:43,745
They got hair like this
in New York? I look punk!

618
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:44,706
Honest!

619
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:45,905
Don't laugh!

620
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,425
Give us a kiss, Sayid.

621
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:50,182
Outta my face!

622
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:53,103
No hard feelings, sucker!

623
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,578
Hey pooch,
your master's an asshole!

624
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:07,069
There's your sister.

625
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:15,180
- Why're you here?
- And you?

626
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:17,386
I'm asking the questions!

627
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:19,865
You should be in school.

628
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:22,345
Get outta here!

629
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,826
Get lost, you cows.

630
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:28,383
You still here?

631
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:32,224
Get lost!

632
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,228
You talk to my friends!

633
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:35,869
To Vincent.

634
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,739
The name's Vinz, not Vincent!
And don't talk to him!

635
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:42,788
- Get a move on!
- Don't push!

636
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:48,946
- Coming tonight?
- Where?

637
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:51,943
Jason's brother's in a prize fight.

638
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:54,305
- Got tickets?
- Freebies.

639
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:55,823
Killer!

640
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,188
Who cut your hair, Sayid?

641
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:02,461
Kids these days!

642
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:03,740
Check that!

643
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:07,822
Shit's happenin'!

644
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:21,060
Abdel's my brother, pig!

645
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:24,903
You're gonna pay!

646
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:27,500
Step on it!

647
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:29,259
It's stalled!

648
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:31,301
Outta the car, freeze!

649
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,980
Drop the gun!

650
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:49,669
Freeze!

651
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:10,985
Get back!

652
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:13,383
Get the fuck out!

653
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:15,666
Riot cops are coming!

654
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:17,821
Get back, scum!

655
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:30,467
Vinz, Hubert, this way!

656
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:35,469
This way!

657
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:38,865
Freeze!

658
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:44,021
You crazy?

659
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,579
Where were you?

660
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:51,106
We fucked your mother!

661
00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:00,066
I swear the pig was
right in my sights.

662
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:03,108
I had him like I have you now!

663
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:07,024
The sucker froze,
shit his pants.

664
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:09,340
Without Hubert,
I'd have smoked him!

665
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:11,341
Right in the mother!

666
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:14,741
Hubert slugged him so hard
he went into orbit!

667
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:15,581
No!

668
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:16,944
I swear it!

669
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:18,429
Slugged a pig?

670
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:21,267
You were great!

671
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:34,622
THE WORLD IS YOURS

672
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:13,141
Now what do we do?

673
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:19,621
I gotta call to get my bucks.

674
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:27,827
Got Snoopy's address?

675
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:30,904
I'll wait, but not forever!

676
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:37,388
This cost me a $3 chocolate milk!
I'd better collect!

677
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:40,430
You want some, Vinz?

678
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:41,785
- Want some?
- No.

679
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:43,019
You sure?

680
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:46,546
Want some, Cousin Hubie?

681
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:49,101
You're already chocolate!

682
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:57,024
Will you guys stop sulking?

683
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,507
Who's sulking? Not me!

684
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:03,308
- Unbelievable!
- Ask him!

685
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:04,983
A couple of kids!

686
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:08,984
- Who's the kid?
- 2 kids worrying over jackshit!

687
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:11,539
I'm 100%behind you!

688
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:14,505
Wanting to kill a cop is jackshit!

689
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:19,589
Tell your buddy to back off!
I never said I wanted to.

690
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:20,581
Yes, you did!

691
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:21,500
- Yes!
- No!

692
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:23,422
I didn't say that!

693
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:25,546
I said if Abdel died,

694
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:28,349
I'd smoke a cop.
Not for the hell of it!

695
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:30,661
Without my gun back there,

696
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:32,582
we'd have been history!

697
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:34,866
My name's not Rodney King!

698
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:36,702
Not the same thing!

699
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:40,067
Expect us to bring you
gifts in jail?

700
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:44,663
I expect nothing!
Not from a guy who kisses cop ass!

701
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:47,702
Go ahead, laugh!

702
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:49,622
Laugh!

703
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:52,782
I'm fuckin' sick
of the goddam system!

704
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:56,659
We live in rat holes,
you do fuck-all to change things!

705
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:58,821
Neither do you!

706
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:01,339
You're my homeys,
so I'll tell you:

707
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:03,341
If Abdel dies, I hit back.

708
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:05,307
I'll whack a pig!

709
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:10,661
So they know we don't turn
the other cheek now!

710
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:12,868
Wow, what a speech!

711
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:15,749
Half Moses, half Mickey Mouse.

712
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:19,380
Forget it, Vinz.
You're out of your league.

713
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:22,110
If Abdel dies, we lose a friend?

714
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:22,986
Right!

715
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:25,710
If a cop dies,
do all cops go away?

716
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:29,658
You're just one guy!
You can't blow 'em all away!

717
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:31,821
Who made you a preacher?

718
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:34,550
You know what's right and wrong?

719
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:37,463
Why do you side with the assholes?

720
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:39,666
Who's the asshole?

721
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:44,142
In school we learnt
that hate breeds hate!

722
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:47,302
I didn't go to school,
I'm from the street!

723
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:49,028
Know what it taught me?

724
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:52,705
Turn the other cheek,
you're dead mothafucka!

725
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:58,225
Bullshit! You pointed a gun
at a cop! We coulda been killed!

726
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:00,301
Nothing like a good shit!

727
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:05,423
You believe in God?
That's the wrong question.

728
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:07,785
Does God believe in us?

729
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:11,460
I once had a friend
called Grunwalski.

730
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:14,702
We were sent to Siberia together.

731
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:18,426
When you go to a Siberian work camp,

732
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:21,343
you travel in a cattle car.

733
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:25,423
You roll across icy steppes
for days,

734
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:27,785
without seeing a soul.

735
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:30,225
You huddle to keep warm.

736
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:34,981
But it's hard to relieve yourself,
to take a shit,

737
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:37,459
you can't do it on the train,

738
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:40,428
and the only time the train stops

739
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:44,105
is to take on water
for the locomotive.

740
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:47,182
But Grunwalski was shy.

741
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:49,545
Even when we bathed together,

742
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,305
he got upset.

743
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:54,780
I used to kid him about it.

744
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:59,820
So, the train stops and everyone
jumps out to shit

745
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,821
on the tracks.

746
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:05,221
I'd teased Grunwalski so much

747
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:08,462
that he went off on his own.

748
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:11,383
The train starts moving,

749
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:13,700
so everyone jumps on,

750
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:16,424
because it waits for nobody.

751
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:19,140
Grunwalski had a problem:

752
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:22,222
he'd gone behind a bush

753
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:24,267
and was still shitting.

754
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:28,749
So I see him come out
from behind the bush,

755
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:31,219
holding up his pants

756
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:33,347
with his hands.

757
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:36,064
He tries to catch up.

758
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:38,347
I hold out my hand,

759
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:41,229
but each time he reaches for it

760
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:43,062
he lets go of his pants

761
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:45,425
and they drop to his ankles.

762
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:47,462
He pulls them back up,

763
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:49,302
starts running again,

764
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:52,780
but they fall back down,

765
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:55,305
when he reaches out for me.

766
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:58,860
- Then what happened?
- Nothing.

767
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:00,669
Grunwalski...

768
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:03,542
froze to death.

769
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:06,426
Good day.

770
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:14,782
Why'd he tell us that?

771
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:25,105
I got the address. I'll call you.

772
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:30,262
Why'd he tell us that?

773
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:47,865
'Scuse me,
I'm just out of the hospital.

774
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:50,021
I haven't eaten for 2 days.

775
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:53,865
My child's hungry,
I need your spare change...

776
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:58,504
I wanna date with Mina!

777
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:00,501
I'll lasso her!

778
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:04,104
What d'you want?
My dad's in jail,

779
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:06,704
my mom's in jail,
my whole family is!

780
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,861
Get a job like everyone else!

781
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:11,584
What is this, Mardi Gras?

782
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:16,222
I want Mina!

783
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:22,867
I'm homeless,
my welfare ran out.

784
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:26,944
I got out of a halfway house...

785
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:29,499
It's a block away.

786
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:30,387
Thanks.

787
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:31,949
Have a nice day, sir.

788
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:33,145
Thanks.

789
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:39,825
The pigs are fuckin' polite
around here!

790
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:43,066
Even called me sir!

791
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:56,225
Maybe he won the lottery!

792
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:02,985
Damn, it's locked!

793
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:06,220
What's his real name?

794
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:09,063
I only know him as Snoopy.

795
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:18,703
- Yes?
- Sorry to bother you.

796
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:20,462
I'm looking for...

797
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:21,825
Snoopy.

798
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:24,546
- It sounds weird.
- Very funny!

799
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,501
The fucker hung up.

800
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:30,504
You try.

801
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:32,626
- Why me?
- Try!

802
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:35,101
Darkie and me
will get shot at!

803
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:39,183
- Hello.
- Yes?

804
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:41,147
Is Snoopy there?

805
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:43,941
No, but Charlie Brown is!

806
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:50,509
You fucked it up, you asshole!

807
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:51,739
Stop that!

808
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:53,628
Sorry to bother you.

809
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:57,942
Our pal Snoopy lives here,
we don't know his real name.

810
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:01,341
Stop ringing!
You thinka da world is yours?

811
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:03,341
Unreal!

812
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:08,747
No, we're staying!

813
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:14,181
So call the cops, you spic!

814
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:15,066
Sayid?

815
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:17,424
Snoopy?

816
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:20,146
- What floor?
- 5th.

817
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:21,459
We're coming!

818
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:25,622
Snoopy?
ls no name!

819
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:27,542
You always make-a trouble!

820
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:42,146
- Were you followed?
- No.

821
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:43,948
- No one?
- Nobody!

822
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:45,338
- You sure?
- Why?

823
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:46,704
Because...

824
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:50,987
You cool?

825
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:52,469
Great!

826
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:54,063
Check that kitchen.

827
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:55,943
Who's this dude?

828
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:00,429
Nice space!
You win the lottery?

829
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:04,105
A guy loaned it to me.
He ain't gettin' it back!

830
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:07,307
This is no apartment,
it's a palace!

831
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:08,619
I don't believe it.

832
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:11,065
Bitchin' apartment!

833
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:14,028
Snoopy, meet Vinz.

834
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:17,982
This is Cousin Hubert!

835
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:19,863
We've met before!

836
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:22,268
- Line of coke?
- No.

837
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:23,943
- You sure?
- No thanks.

838
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:26,749
A little line of coke?

839
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,424
No one for coke?

840
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:31,746
- How's your bro?
- OK.

841
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:33,582
Mean fuckin' dude!

842
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,945
- He still a maniac?
- And you?

843
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:38,021
Fuckin' A!
Watch!

844
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:40,143
So you got my cash?

845
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:41,659
My bread!

846
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:45,061
Make it snappy, Snoopy!

847
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:47,266
Cut the bullshit!

848
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:51,619
Come get it.

849
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:54,380
Comin' at you, Bruce Lee!

850
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,107
- Hands off!
- What?

851
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,625
Not for kids! It's my gun!

852
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:09,229
So what? I got a piece too.

853
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:12,145
Let's see!

854
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:14,309
Whip it out.

855
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:19,066
Fuck!

856
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:20,504
Don't, Vinz!

857
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:21,779
He knows guns.

858
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:25,147
A snub-nosed
Smith & Wesson Magnum 44.

859
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:26,979
Watch it!

860
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:28,185
It's loaded.

861
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:30,345
Mean piece.

862
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:32,709
You're a gangsta.

863
00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:35,508
It's for self-defense.

864
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:37,581
You into magic?

865
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:38,660
Watch.

866
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:40,139
One bullet.

867
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:45,225
I missed.

868
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:46,899
You're nuts!

869
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:49,948
- That's live ammo!
- It's an old trick!

870
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:51,739
Cool it.

871
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:55,141
We up the stakes: 2 bullets!

872
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:57,225
Snoopy!

873
00:58:57,390 --> 00:58:59,984
Wiggin' out, guys?

874
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:02,222
You're nuts.

875
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:03,459
Gimme!

876
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:06,385
Your turn.

877
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:08,381
Let's go, he's fried.

878
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:09,460
Gonna do it?

879
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:12,106
- Gimme.
- Do it!

880
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:15,103
I did it, you do it!

881
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:17,067
Man, you want trouble?

882
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:18,868
Do it!

883
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:20,978
Chill, guys!

884
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:24,503
Stop, Vinz!

885
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:25,944
You aiming at me?

886
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:27,862
You're off your head!

887
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:29,822
You bet I'm aiming at you!

888
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:32,026
No one fucks with me!

889
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:35,265
I'm not some ass-wipe!

890
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:37,903
Wanna see a gun?

891
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:39,628
A fuckin' gun?

892
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:45,186
Sayid, get him out!

893
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:48,508
We're outta here!

894
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:54,183
Up your mother's slash, sucker!

895
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:56,265
Look!

896
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:03,182
That's right, asshole!

897
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:04,739
He was bluffing!

898
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:08,983
Now I'll never get my cash!

899
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:12,142
Leave us out of your games, Vinz!

900
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:16,861
Games? We got a pal
in the hospital!

901
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,941
Don't take on the world!

902
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:21,180
You got the wrong build!

903
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:25,059
I'm not like you,
Mr. Black Hercules, right?

904
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:26,458
Go fuck yourself!

905
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:27,905
Fuck myself?

906
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:36,862
Alright, kids!

907
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:38,509
- Who're you?
- Easy!

908
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:40,740
You had your fun!

909
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:42,309
Easy!

910
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:46,948
Search them.

911
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:49,783
Fast work! ln my 'hood,
the cops come

912
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:52,066
a week after you're dead!

913
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:53,709
Hey, you!

914
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:57,623
- You together?
- I don't know them.

915
01:00:57,790 --> 01:00:59,189
Why you here?

916
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:01,227
I live with my aunt!

917
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:02,539
What's her name?

918
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:04,382
Mrs. Zyl...

919
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:09,789
- Got l.D.?
- I'm on the level...

920
01:01:16,950 --> 01:01:18,827
Easy!

921
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:20,901
Freeze!

922
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,589
Don't move, boy!

923
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:24,385
You know him?

924
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:25,949
- Who?
- Your pal.

925
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:27,623
I don't know him.

926
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:31,224
We'll see about that, wise guy!

927
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,221
- This is humiliating!
- Too bad.

928
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:37,429
What's this?

929
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:39,264
Good stuff!

930
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:41,979
I'm keeping it.

931
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:45,945
Afghan's the best.

932
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:48,346
Good buzz going up and down.

933
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:50,978
Same with Black Bombay.

934
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:53,260
Lebanese can really vary.

935
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:57,218
This is crap
but I'll keep it...Well?

936
01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:00,707
The little fucker outran me.
Take them in.

937
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:02,349
- Get in the back.
- Why me?

938
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:03,829
Get in!

939
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:19,098
Listen, scumbag.
You know what I think of you?

940
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:21,221
You're like poodle shit
on a sidewalk.

941
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:23,585
I can't take a step

942
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:27,948
without squashing
your ugly dog-turd f ace.

943
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:31,428
So watch where the dog dumps you!

944
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:26,664
You're all alone!

945
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:28,942
Far from the slums...

946
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:30,863
and your looter pals.

947
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:34,144
Pick it up with your feet.

948
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:36,746
Like your people do back home.

949
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:40,185
They're great with their feet.

950
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:43,666
This is the hard part.

951
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:50,747
OK, there's no big hurry.

952
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:53,026
In 2 hours, they may be free.

953
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:54,942
Make the most of it.

954
01:03:57,350 --> 01:04:00,945
How 'bout a bullet
in the back of your head?

955
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:03,182
A nice little bullet?

956
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:05,625
You gotta stop in time.

957
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:08,065
You need self-control.

958
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:09,788
Gotta be a pro.

959
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:12,510
This takes control.

960
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:16,066
Don't get mad! It won't last!

961
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:21,869
You got something to say?

962
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:25,542
Don't touch him!

963
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:28,259
You know this one?

964
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:30,227
The Shanghai Squeeze.

965
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:32,386
It's an oldie.

966
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:36,989
Wait, I think he's thirsty.

967
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:40,029
Fucker!

968
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:42,260
Don't hurt yourself!

969
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:44,660
Take it easy!

970
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,706
Don't get me aroused.

971
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:50,066
You look like a bitch from behind!

972
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:53,620
A nice bitch to suck me off!

973
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:56,669
Blow jobs!

974
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:58,702
Bitches to suck my dick!

975
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:01,989
That's the way.
Then you relax!

976
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:04,870
But it's hard to stop in time.

977
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:07,100
You gotta stay in control.

978
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:12,219
That's the trick.

979
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:13,789
I like his face.

980
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:14,939
He's cute.

981
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:17,267
What was the name?

982
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:22,420
- Are you cute?
- Yes! I'm cute!

983
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:25,350
I'm cute!

984
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:28,822
- Which one?
- He's Hubert.

985
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:30,389
That's no Hubert!

986
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:32,347
He's French, he's Sayid.

987
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:34,307
Sayid? That's pretty!

988
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:37,428
Is Sayid a French name?

989
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:39,865
Aren't they pretty?

990
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:43,019
Take a good look!

991
01:05:44,990 --> 01:05:46,981
The little guy's excited.

992
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:50,062
Leave him alone!

993
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:59,421
It's so easy to go too far!

994
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:02,548
But you mustn't!
Though you're dying to!

995
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:05,903
Right, you Arab sonofabitch?

996
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:10,222
OK, let's go.

997
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:33,188
Sir!

998
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:35,147
We'll miss the last train!

999
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:36,538
Forget it.

1000
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:37,779
Bastard!

1001
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:40,544
Did I talk to you?

1002
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:12,463
Yo, Vinz!

1003
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:15,542
Where's Sayid and Hubert?

1004
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:18,019
Dunno. They pissed me off tonight.

1005
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:20,579
You guys are always fussin'!

1006
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:51,103
Your sister's hot.

1007
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:54,020
Shut up, asshole.

1008
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:56,182
Sorry, but she's hot.

1009
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:58,147
You don't stand a chance.

1010
01:07:58,310 --> 01:08:00,266
Don't you try.

1011
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:03,660
Don't even look at her!

1012
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:05,388
Check the turn!

1013
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:08,223
I won't try 'cause she's pregnant.

1014
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:12,224
Don't diss my sis', butthead!

1015
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:25,461
Brothers,
I gotta make it

1016
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:27,860
by any means necessary

1017
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:30,339
'cos my mind's
playin' tricks on me.

1018
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:37,189
You won't let us in?

1019
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:39,068
Beat it!

1020
01:08:40,590 --> 01:08:44,708
That nigger bouncer
never lets us in!

1021
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:46,588
We know his bro for 10 years!

1022
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:49,822
And he still gives us shit!

1023
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:51,942
Drives me crazy!

1024
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:54,906
What's up with the flare gun?

1025
01:08:55,950 --> 01:08:57,588
Where you going?

1026
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:59,389
Don't be a hot dog!

1027
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:03,185
Stop!

1028
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:06,583
I told you I'd be back!

1029
01:09:08,150 --> 01:09:09,981
Not so big now, fuckface!

1030
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:13,301
You and your stinkin' club!

1031
01:09:13,630 --> 01:09:16,622
Fuck your club!

1032
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:19,065
Goddam nigger!

1033
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:38,462
That cop made us miss it.

1034
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:41,222
Dickless fuckin' Tracy!

1035
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:55,908
When's the next one?

1036
01:09:56,310 --> 01:09:57,663
Tomorrow morning.

1037
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:38,861
How much did Snoopy owe you?

1038
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:39,780
What?

1039
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:41,542
What'd he owe you?

1040
01:10:41,710 --> 01:10:42,904
One.

1041
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:45,220
- $1,000?
- No, $100.

1042
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:46,459
What?

1043
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:48,860
All this shit for a lousy $100!

1044
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:51,669
It's the principle that counts.

1045
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:55,308
Principle!

1046
01:10:57,470 --> 01:10:59,859
Coyote's a bad motherfucker.

1047
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:02,498
Roadrunner's a pussy.

1048
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:05,105
Pick between Tweetie and Sylvester.

1049
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:07,468
Fuck you and Tweetie!

1050
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:10,622
I don't take shit
from a guy who sees cows!

1051
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:14,021
I say Sylvester's the real gangsta.

1052
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:16,427
Bottom line! 'Nuff said!

1053
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:20,105
Can't talk with you guys
if you won't listen.

1054
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:21,828
'Cause you listen?

1055
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:24,424
You got it all wrong.

1056
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:28,549
I say Tweetie's the baddest.
He always wins.

1057
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:30,343
That's bullshit!

1058
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:33,349
Sylvester fucks Tweetie and you!

1059
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:35,224
Come again?

1060
01:11:35,950 --> 01:11:38,100
Who does he fuck? Me?

1061
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:40,101
Anyway,
Sylvester's a black brother.

1062
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:41,828
A black brother?

1063
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:43,345
Full of shit!

1064
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:46,305
Shall we, gentlemen?

1065
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:48,222
What can we lose?

1066
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:59,186
It's positively frightful!

1067
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:07,548
Is this guy famous?

1068
01:12:09,470 --> 01:12:12,064
He will be when he grows up!

1069
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:32,100
There's Champagne,
Cinzano, Bogardi...

1070
01:12:32,270 --> 01:12:33,988
- I don't drink.
- I mean Bacardi.

1071
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:35,139
Outta my way.

1072
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:37,943
I want peanuts.

1073
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:42,749
Cheers, Charles!

1074
01:12:43,310 --> 01:12:45,107
Hey, Charles!

1075
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:47,943
Behave, asshole!

1076
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:52,744
Let 'em through, Sayid!

1077
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:55,628
Check out the babes!

1078
01:12:55,790 --> 01:12:57,701
That's what I call women!

1079
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:00,427
The sister is hot.

1080
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:03,025
Do me a favor.

1081
01:13:03,190 --> 01:13:04,828
I'm not going!

1082
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:07,584
Who bought the tacos last week?

1083
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,786
You owe me one.

1084
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:11,224
Get me the sister.

1085
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:12,665
Awright.

1086
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:15,268
There's just two!

1087
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:16,863
- Who cares?
- Shut up!

1088
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:19,100
Get her for me, Hubert!

1089
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:27,379
Excuse me, my name's Hubert.

1090
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:31,789
My friend's a romantic,
he's really shy.

1091
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:34,259
He'd love to meet you.

1092
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:35,783
That's him.

1093
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:38,785
What d'ya say?

1094
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:41,145
Look what you did to me!

1095
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:43,582
He's really cool.

1096
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:46,947
- He's too nice.
- OK, then!

1097
01:13:47,110 --> 01:13:48,384
C'mon Sayid!

1098
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:50,539
Hold this.

1099
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:54,380
Haven't we met before?

1100
01:13:54,590 --> 01:13:55,909
Don't I wish!

1101
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:57,264
Hi, girls!

1102
01:13:57,430 --> 01:13:58,067
I'm Sayid.

1103
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:02,380
Please don't lean on the painting.

1104
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:03,585
You're the painting!

1105
01:14:05,390 --> 01:14:06,186
I'm good at what?

1106
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:07,499
Guess, babe!

1107
01:14:07,670 --> 01:14:09,422
We heard you were shy!

1108
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:12,866
Shy? That's my middle name!

1109
01:14:13,630 --> 01:14:16,098
What's your number?
We'll go out.

1110
01:14:16,270 --> 01:14:18,659
You're all alike!

1111
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:20,900
He said you wanted to talk.

1112
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:23,425
Talk? What about?

1113
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:27,423
Lighten up!
We were ready to talk,

1114
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:31,503
but with your attitude,
how can we respect you?

1115
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:34,901
Who are you?
The Wonderbra bitch?

1116
01:14:35,070 --> 01:14:37,459
- Who asked you?
- I'm asking you!

1117
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:39,188
He's nuts.

1118
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:41,820
What are you staring at?

1119
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:43,504
Got a screw loose?

1120
01:14:43,670 --> 01:14:45,581
You're the screw.

1121
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:50,108
- Stop!
- What's wrong with you?

1122
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:54,226
Leave us alone,
we didn't ask you over!

1123
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:56,028
Gentlemen, please!

1124
01:14:56,190 --> 01:14:58,146
It's cool, Pops!

1125
01:14:58,310 --> 01:15:02,019
Nobody's been hurt!
What's your beef?

1126
01:15:02,190 --> 01:15:04,909
- Keep your heads, please.
- Please what?

1127
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:07,065
Let's go!

1128
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:09,148
Pretty please!

1129
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:11,665
Let's all calm down!

1130
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:13,184
Stop that!

1131
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:14,669
Stop your friend.

1132
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:17,469
You're not my friend!
Fuck you!

1133
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:20,784
Know what?

1134
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:23,266
Go suck cocks in hell!

1135
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:26,661
- With your mothers!
- You're all ugly!

1136
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:29,298
I'm fuckin' sorry, sir!

1137
01:15:32,270 --> 01:15:34,420
Have fun, mothafuckas!

1138
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:38,903
Troubled youth!

1139
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:40,901
We shoulda swiped a bottle.

1140
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:43,948
I got the sucker's charge card!

1141
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:46,670
Hubert! Up to your old tricks!

1142
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:48,821
Like riding a bike:
you don't forget.

1143
01:15:48,990 --> 01:15:51,458
Mr. David Moe?

1144
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:55,068
He's not here?

1145
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:57,223
We keep it for him!

1146
01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:59,062
Give it to me.

1147
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:02,502
What's the score?

1148
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:03,819
Killer!

1149
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:05,908
Know what I'm saying?

1150
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:09,266
Your name's not David!

1151
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:11,307
And cabs don't take plastic.

1152
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:12,698
Just this once.

1153
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:14,906
Gimme a break!

1154
01:16:19,470 --> 01:16:20,619
You fart?

1155
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:22,343
It was you.
Who else?

1156
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:24,785
It stinks. Had to be you.

1157
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:25,985
That's not my stink.

1158
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:27,583
I know your farts.

1159
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:30,105
Mothafucka, we're locked out.

1160
01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:36,619
Who farted?

1161
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:38,064
- He did.
- He did.

1162
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:41,587
Can't you tell?

1163
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:44,429
It was him.

1164
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:46,740
Your ass reeks.

1165
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:51,106
Motherfucking
goddam steering wheel!

1166
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:53,306
Cut the poetry

1167
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:55,267
and pull the thing!

1168
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:58,706
Jean-Claude does this
in five seconds flat.

1169
01:16:58,870 --> 01:16:59,939
Which Jean-Claude?

1170
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:01,099
The mailman?

1171
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:04,706
No, that's Sylvie's boyfriend.

1172
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:07,259
This guy got 2 years
for car theft.

1173
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:09,546
Move it,
bust the fucker!

1174
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:12,827
Use your foot!

1175
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:34,864
Don't be a sissy.

1176
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:37,305
Who's a sissy?

1177
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:43,780
Relax, Max.

1178
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:56,541
"Night of the Living Car!"

1179
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:00,267
The wipers!

1180
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:06,667
Rip open that plastic box.

1181
01:18:06,830 --> 01:18:08,502
Open sesame!

1182
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:14,425
Connect the green wire
to the red one.

1183
01:18:14,590 --> 01:18:16,865
Nah, that's for the blinkers.

1184
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:19,305
How'd they do it in on TV?

1185
01:18:19,470 --> 01:18:21,620
Fuck TV!

1186
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:25,349
Start the mother!

1187
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:30,225
Who the fuck's he?

1188
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:34,108
Freaked me out!

1189
01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:36,742
Who the fuck are you?

1190
01:18:36,910 --> 01:18:38,502
- Huh?
- What you doin'?

1191
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:39,705
Nothing.

1192
01:18:39,910 --> 01:18:41,628
So go somewhere else.

1193
01:18:41,790 --> 01:18:43,701
Move, you'll get us nabbed.

1194
01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:45,019
It's my wife...

1195
01:18:45,190 --> 01:18:46,259
What about her?

1196
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:48,460
She left me.

1197
01:18:49,390 --> 01:18:51,460
Do we fuckin' care?

1198
01:18:53,350 --> 01:18:55,386
Don't wait for the law, start it.

1199
01:18:55,550 --> 01:18:57,268
Move!

1200
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:59,546
The red wire to the green wire.

1201
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:02,270
Lay off, that's for the horn!

1202
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:03,579
Try the blue, jerk!

1203
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:07,746
You do it! lf you're so smart.

1204
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:09,059
I'll kill you! !

1205
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:12,462
You're a drag.

1206
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:15,466
That wire's for the horn.

1207
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:17,060
No, that's the horn!

1208
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:20,862
Sayid's right.

1209
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:22,861
You see?

1210
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:25,828
Who was right?
We do it my way!

1211
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:27,548
Gimme some metal!

1212
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:29,109
Move it!

1213
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:32,261
You're a good guy.
What's your name?

1214
01:19:34,350 --> 01:19:35,908
You got a name?

1215
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:40,864
At least we put it to good use!

1216
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:44,659
Ready? Watch this.

1217
01:19:57,110 --> 01:19:58,862
Anyone know how to drive?

1218
01:19:59,270 --> 01:20:01,704
- Vinz does.
- Wait a second.

1219
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:04,430
I never learned,
I got no licence.

1220
01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:06,706
He does. He was in the Army.

1221
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:09,065
The Navy! I can't drive.

1222
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:10,858
I can!

1223
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:12,349
Shut up!

1224
01:20:14,150 --> 01:20:15,105
- Vinz?
- What?

1225
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:19,229
You took that bitch
around lsrael in a Mercedes.

1226
01:20:19,710 --> 01:20:22,463
Not the same thing!

1227
01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:24,700
That was different. It was... uh...

1228
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:27,259
It was an automatic...

1229
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:28,660
More like a dream!

1230
01:20:31,270 --> 01:20:33,181
You guys are so lame!

1231
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:37,548
Now what?

1232
01:20:39,230 --> 01:20:42,427
Sorry,
but a cop car's coming.

1233
01:20:42,590 --> 01:20:44,546
- Where?
- That's a cop car.

1234
01:20:44,710 --> 01:20:45,699
It's real close.

1235
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:50,619
On three, we're outta here, OK?

1236
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:51,861
Ready?

1237
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:52,507
Three!

1238
01:20:59,670 --> 01:21:01,103
Freeze!

1239
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:06,663
Out of the way!

1240
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:14,342
"You down with OCB?"

1241
01:21:14,510 --> 01:21:16,102
"Yeah, you know me..."

1242
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:17,783
"You're down with OCB?"

1243
01:21:17,950 --> 01:21:19,747
"Yeah, you know me..."

1244
01:21:19,990 --> 01:21:21,787
"Yeah, you know me..."

1245
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:25,590
Sometimes you feel
so fuckin' small...

1246
01:21:26,110 --> 01:21:28,021
Got any more bullshit wisdom?

1247
01:21:28,190 --> 01:21:30,988
"The early bird catches the worm."

1248
01:21:31,150 --> 01:21:33,539
"A stitch in time saves nine."

1249
01:21:33,710 --> 01:21:36,543
"Haste makes waste."

1250
01:21:36,710 --> 01:21:39,065
"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity."

1251
01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:42,267
I save that one
for special occasions.

1252
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:45,225
Holy fuck!

1253
01:21:45,790 --> 01:21:47,860
I'm wasted.

1254
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:50,146
Your shit is dope!

1255
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:53,105
Sayid, watch it!

1256
01:21:54,630 --> 01:21:55,540
He's a big boy!

1257
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:57,541
- Spray cans!
- You're the can!

1258
01:21:58,430 --> 01:22:01,786
What was that old guy
in the john trying to say?

1259
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:05,340
Talked about God and shitting.
What was the point?

1260
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:06,863
I see skinheads.

1261
01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:08,224
You're the skinhead.

1262
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:09,266
Fuck Nazis!

1263
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:11,819
The point is: God's inside you,

1264
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:13,469
so He helps you dump!

1265
01:22:13,630 --> 01:22:15,860
God loves your bowels.

1266
01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:17,065
Pass the joint.

1267
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:21,709
Check this shit out:

1268
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:26,629
"Pinhead is to skinhead,
as teeny is to weenie."

1269
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:28,906
Get my drift?

1270
01:22:29,190 --> 01:22:30,703
Out of the way.

1271
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:44,378
Know the one about the guy
falling off a skyscraper?

1272
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:47,542
On the way down he says to himself:

1273
01:22:47,710 --> 01:22:52,101
"So far so good...
so far so good..."

1274
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:56,740
I heard it with a rabbi.

1275
01:22:57,230 --> 01:23:01,382
Like us in the projects.
So far so good,

1276
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:03,309
but how will we land?

1277
01:23:03,870 --> 01:23:07,101
I feel like an ant
lost in intergalactic space.

1278
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:12,939
Watch, I'll switch off
the Eiffel Tower.

1279
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:20,940
That only works in movies.

1280
01:23:21,110 --> 01:23:22,429
Mothafucka!

1281
01:23:22,590 --> 01:23:23,818
You in a movie?

1282
01:23:23,990 --> 01:23:25,708
In a porn flick
with your mother!

1283
01:23:25,870 --> 01:23:27,542
Look who's talking!

1284
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:30,907
Yours sticks carrots up her ass!

1285
01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:34,906
You're the carrot!

1286
01:23:43,550 --> 01:23:45,620
THE WORLD IS YOURS

1287
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:59,788
THE WORLD IS OURS

1288
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:10,745
How did they get
the car in the gym?

1289
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:13,344
Search me...Ask God!

1290
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:14,227
Very funny.

1291
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:26,382
Look at those sheep in the system.

1292
01:24:26,550 --> 01:24:31,340
They look cute
in their fancy leather jackets.

1293
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:33,068
But they're scumbags.

1294
01:24:33,230 --> 01:24:36,620
They ride escalators,
carried by the system.

1295
01:24:37,190 --> 01:24:39,420
They vote far right,
but aren't racists.

1296
01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:42,627
They can't move without escalators.

1297
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:44,348
The worst!

1298
01:24:47,230 --> 01:24:48,549
Racist!

1299
01:25:26,190 --> 01:25:27,942
WAR IN BOSNIA

1300
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:37,986
ABDEL ICHAHA DIES

1301
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:02,383
Where's Vinz?

1302
01:26:10,030 --> 01:26:12,021
Mothafucka!

1303
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:31,620
What?

1304
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:34,904
Dumb fuck!

1305
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:37,868
What did I do?

1306
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:40,946
Why hit me?

1307
01:26:44,630 --> 01:26:46,109
What did I do?

1308
01:26:48,030 --> 01:26:49,702
What'd I do, asshole?

1309
01:26:49,870 --> 01:26:51,349
You suck big time!

1310
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:53,023
So what'd I do?

1311
01:26:53,190 --> 01:26:55,306
Help me, Sayid! Please.

1312
01:26:55,470 --> 01:26:58,109
Help you what?
What'd I do?

1313
01:26:58,270 --> 01:26:59,498
Abdel's dead now!

1314
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:01,388
He's sick of your shit!

1315
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:02,619
What shit?

1316
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:04,781
What the fuck I do?

1317
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:09,219
You wanna kill a pig,
go right ahead.

1318
01:27:10,630 --> 01:27:12,268
But you're on your own.

1319
01:27:12,510 --> 01:27:14,148
We're outta here.

1320
01:27:18,070 --> 01:27:19,503
Get lost.

1321
01:27:19,990 --> 01:27:21,548
Both of you!

1322
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:25,670
I don't need you!

1323
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:31,822
I know who I am
and where I come from!

1324
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:34,345
So go home and shut up!

1325
01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:36,819
Fuck your mother!

1326
01:27:53,150 --> 01:27:54,424
Don't bug me, Sayid.

1327
01:27:54,590 --> 01:27:56,148
Think we should've...

1328
01:27:59,630 --> 01:28:00,904
Just what we need!

1329
01:28:01,070 --> 01:28:02,185
A nigger!

1330
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:06,662
You're the fucker
who dissed us from the roof!

1331
01:28:06,830 --> 01:28:08,900
The gang banger from the roof?

1332
01:28:09,070 --> 01:28:11,630
Let's see you fight!

1333
01:28:15,230 --> 01:28:16,583
Hold him!

1334
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:23,698
Come back!

1335
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:25,508
You fuckin' asshole!

1336
01:28:25,670 --> 01:28:26,659
I done nothing!

1337
01:28:26,830 --> 01:28:28,422
Faster than a speeding bullet?

1338
01:28:28,590 --> 01:28:30,785
I done nothing!

1339
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:32,664
Check it out!

1340
01:28:34,190 --> 01:28:35,418
Whadda you say?

1341
01:28:43,870 --> 01:28:46,100
Get the fuck in there!

1342
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:57,149
Whatcha gonna do?

1343
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:01,102
You think I'm all talk?

1344
01:29:01,270 --> 01:29:03,181
I'm all talk?

1345
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:08,866
Watch!
Don't try and stop me!

1346
01:29:10,150 --> 01:29:12,380
- Vinz, don't do it!
- Let him!

1347
01:29:13,630 --> 01:29:15,188
Do your good deed!

1348
01:29:15,910 --> 01:29:16,899
Shut up!

1349
01:29:17,590 --> 01:29:18,989
There are good cops.

1350
01:29:19,150 --> 01:29:22,028
But the only good skinhead
is a dead one!

1351
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:23,943
Shoot him.

1352
01:29:24,110 --> 01:29:27,307
We took your shit all day.
Fuckin' shoot him!

1353
01:29:27,990 --> 01:29:29,184
You got the piece.

1354
01:29:33,030 --> 01:29:34,258
Shoot!

1355
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:37,341
Shoot!

1356
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:43,269
Fuck his mother!

1357
01:29:43,630 --> 01:29:44,665
Shoot!

1358
01:29:47,870 --> 01:29:50,987
Abdel's dead!
Get even, for fuck's sake!

1359
01:29:51,150 --> 01:29:52,868
Do it for Abdel!

1360
01:29:56,950 --> 01:29:57,905
Shoot!

1361
01:30:07,870 --> 01:30:09,781
Get outta here!

1362
01:30:37,550 --> 01:30:39,029
See ya tomorrow.

1363
01:30:51,710 --> 01:30:52,904
Take it.

1364
01:30:56,990 --> 01:30:58,582
Gonna sing a love song?

1365
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:00,069
Go home, loser.

1366
01:31:00,230 --> 01:31:03,142
Let's go, Vinz.

1367
01:31:03,350 --> 01:31:04,703
Later, Hubert.

1368
01:31:05,550 --> 01:31:07,381
Hear the one about the nun?

1369
01:31:07,550 --> 01:31:09,939
This drunk guy comes out of a bar,

1370
01:31:10,110 --> 01:31:13,466
and walks up to a nun
in this big black cape.

1371
01:31:13,630 --> 01:31:17,100
Wham! He slugs her
in her teeth. She goes down

1372
01:31:17,270 --> 01:31:19,830
and he keeps on pounding her.

1373
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:23,660
After about 5 minutes he stops,

1374
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:26,339
Iooks at her and says:

1375
01:31:26,510 --> 01:31:28,421
"You're not so tough, Batman!"

1376
01:31:28,590 --> 01:31:30,706
That's a killer!

1377
01:31:31,030 --> 01:31:32,986
He thought the nun was Batman!

1378
01:31:33,150 --> 01:31:35,300
I heard it with a rabbi.

1379
01:31:36,310 --> 01:31:37,265
Over here, you!

1380
01:31:37,670 --> 01:31:38,989
What's the matter?

1381
01:31:39,550 --> 01:31:40,778
I know you!

1382
01:31:43,390 --> 01:31:44,823
You were on the roof!

1383
01:31:56,070 --> 01:31:57,583
What're you doin'?

1384
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:01,107
Got a problem, you fuck?

1385
01:32:01,590 --> 01:32:03,501
Scared without your pals?

1386
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:05,823
Not so tough now!

1387
01:32:05,990 --> 01:32:08,185
Look at him!

1388
01:32:34,230 --> 01:32:36,380
It's about a society falling...

1389
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:40,589
On the way down
it keeps telling itself:

1390
01:32:40,870 --> 01:32:42,622
"So far so good...

1391
01:32:43,470 --> 01:32:45,188
"so far so good...

1392
01:32:46,110 --> 01:32:48,146
"so far so good..."

1393
01:32:49,590 --> 01:32:51,501
How you fall doesn't matter.

1394
01:32:53,030 --> 01:32:54,622
It's how you land!
