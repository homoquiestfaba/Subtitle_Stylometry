1
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,068
Woman:
You know how it is.

2
00:00:34,102 --> 00:00:36,104
You think your life
is normal.

3
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:41,642
You're happy.
You're a little kid.

4
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:43,077
Doesn't matter
where you are.

5
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:48,549
Where we were
was Brooklyn.

6
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:49,850
My dad was born there,

7
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,585
we were born there.

8
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,293
The main thing I remember
is running,

9
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:00,728
always running,

10
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:03,731
to things, from things.

11
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:06,234
Running with my sister,
who was always ahead.

12
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:09,270
My mom running
from the Nazis.

13
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:11,739
She was like
a real-life Anne Frank

14
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,408
hiding out during the war,
except she lived.

15
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:16,877
She was rescued
by American soldiers.

16
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,213
Dad was
the Jewish single one...

17
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:22,750
and they
ran away together.

18
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:23,684
Dad loved to get away,

19
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:26,220
so we were always
running somewhere,

20
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:28,856
going somewhere.

21
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,758
Dad liked to promise us
the world.

22
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,628
(Man whistling melody)

23
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,533
It's not like we wanted
to leave Brooklyn,

24
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:42,170
but all of a sudden,
we were.

25
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:45,173
For someone who was scared
of almost everything,

26
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:47,208
I was okay with that.

27
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:49,910
I was going to be
a famous writer,

28
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,280
so, it didn't matter
where I lived.

29
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:55,449
A lot of great writers
came from New York,

30
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:59,153
but a lot of great writers
came from the South too.

31
00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:01,189
A good writer
can write anywhere,

32
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:02,756
like Anne Frank.

33
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,159
She wrote behind a bookcase
in the attic.

34
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,028
And we brought
our dog buddy,

35
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:11,165
who was 14 and could barely
make it around the block.

36
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,304
Girl:
Antarctica.

37
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:18,239
Mmm.

38
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:19,773
Atlanta.

39
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,244
Uh...

40
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:25,413
I got one
for you, maddie.

41
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:27,948
Arkansas,
ends with an "s."

42
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,950
I know about
the "s." Um...

43
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,652
Come on.
"S" is a no-brainer.

44
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:34,388
I quit.

45
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:36,590
What do you mean,
you quit?

46
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:38,292
You can't quit
with an "s."

47
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:39,660
I just don't want
to play anymore.

48
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:44,665
Well, we got
500 more Miles to go.

49
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:45,966
Got something better
to do?

50
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,570
- What about Spain?
- I said I'm done, okay?

51
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,372
Father:
You're done. You're
done with an "s."

52
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:53,941
What about Seattle,
San Francisco,

53
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:55,443
Saudi Arabia?
Come on.

54
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:57,278
There's a whole world
of s's out there.

55
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:58,579
Narrator:
I wouldn't miss Brooklyn,

56
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:01,582
not really, but maddie,
my sister, she was 17.

57
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,884
She was furious.

58
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,619
She was popular
in high school,

59
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,955
popular enough to know
that nothing was worse

60
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,657
than being a new senior

61
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,792
in a new high school
in the South.

62
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,461
For all we knew,

63
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:15,729
we'd be the only Jewish
family in new Orleans.

64
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:18,699
I'd like a coke,
please.

65
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,734
That's
a nice accent.

66
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:23,604
I'm not the one
with the accent.

67
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,239
(Laughs)
Lenny.

68
00:03:25,273 --> 00:03:27,007
Lenny, please.
Come on.

69
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,809
Let's get the deal
papered first

70
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:30,878
because we start
talking ipos.

71
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,880
Come on, let's go.
It's getting late.

72
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:36,250
Daddy, this is
the ladies' room.

73
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:37,951
I want to get going
before dark.

74
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,491
What are you wasting time
with this yutz for?

75
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:44,592
Just talking.

76
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,327
Yeah, well, come on.
We're late.

77
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,264
Hey, what's a yutz?

78
00:03:50,298 --> 00:03:51,732
Look in
the mirror.

79
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,336
Narrator:
So I asked my dad,

80
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:58,272
"why are we moving
to Louisiana?"

81
00:03:58,306 --> 00:04:01,275
He'd been a new yorker
even as a dirt-poor kid.

82
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:04,278
He told me he needed to be
closer to his factory,

83
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:07,281
400 people making blouses
in the South.

84
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:08,816
Besides, the dollar
goes further there,

85
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,319
and we'd live like kings.

86
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:12,620
- (Tires screech)
- Oh, shit.

87
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:14,655
- (Horn honking)
- You bastard!

88
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,291
Where the hell did
you get your license?!

89
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,498
Narrator:
He always said
everything was fine.

90
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:26,467
I wanted to believe him.
I really did.

91
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,370
But we didn't always
know what to believe

92
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,071
when it came to dad.

93
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,940
(Bell rings)

94
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,377
Father:
Surprise, surprise.

95
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:45,886
(Sighs)

96
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,721
So what
do you think?

97
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:50,424
Oh, my God, Joe.
It's incredible.

98
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,427
(Laughs)
Oh-hh.

99
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:55,629
Only the best
for my beautiful wife.

100
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,064
This is
really it?

101
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,832
What's the matter?
Not enough house for you?

102
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,701
Girl:
Are you kidding?
It's a mansion.

103
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:03,337
Joe:
Four stories,
8,000 square feet.

104
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:05,339
And let's not forget
the olympic-size
swimming pool.

105
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:06,340
Mother:
No.

106
00:05:06,374 --> 00:05:07,274
(Whimpers)

107
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,076
I'm going to go back
to buddy in the car.

108
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,944
Maddie, come on.

109
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,414
Come on.
You're going to love it.
Come on. Come. Just come.

110
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,684
What happened
to the broker, Joe?

111
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:19,420
Ah, she couldn't make it,
but she didn't want
to lose the sale.

112
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:22,490
You know, she knows
a serious buyer
when she sees one.

113
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,126
- (Gasps)
- Oh, my God.

114
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,995
Girl:
I love this place.

115
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,065
This was
designed by a famous
Southern architect.

116
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:33,066
Wow.

117
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,568
Built like
a goddamn fortress.

118
00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:35,903
Maddie:
Or a prison.

119
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,538
Mother: Maybe we
could even have
your weddings here.

120
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,773
We'd be just like
the Kennedys.

121
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:41,409
How many bedrooms
are there?

122
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:42,910
More than you
could count, kid.

123
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,778
Vaulted ceilings.
Fireplace.

124
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:47,581
Come on.
We belong in a place
like this, right?

125
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:50,484
Until the guys with
the white hoods burn
a cross on our lawn.

126
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:53,020
You know, enough
with the snide remarks
maddie, okay?

127
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,155
I'm going
to choose a bedroom

128
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,558
in case
he closes the deal.

129
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,627
This is
amazing.

130
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,861
I hate
this place.

131
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:02,162
Sister:
Hey, maddie,
check this out!

132
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,897
- Listen, I...
- Joe.

133
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:05,999
Listen,
Happy Birthday.

134
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,501
- It's yours.
- It's mine?

135
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:09,002
That's right.
The house.

136
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,137
I bought it
for your birthday.

137
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,040
It's bought and paid for.
I even put it
in your name.

138
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:16,043
For putting up with me
all these years,
all right?

139
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,645
Joe. Oh.

140
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,146
Are you sure
we can afford this?

141
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,113
Of course
we can afford it.

142
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:22,950
Right now, I got one
of the biggest financiers

143
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,785
in the country
underwriting my company.

144
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:27,788
I'm building
an empire here, Stella.

145
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,723
An empire.

146
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:31,992
(Sighs)

147
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,699
(Chuckles)
What are you doing
in there?

148
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,634
There's a crawlspace
in this closet.

149
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:43,136
It's a perfect
secret hiding place.

150
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,006
Huh.

151
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,975
Stella:
Girls, come quickly!

152
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,009
Come on.

153
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:55,148
The house is ours.
Daddy already bought it.

154
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:57,184
(Sighs)
This can't be
happening.

155
00:06:57,217 --> 00:07:00,521
(Squeals)
When do we move in?

156
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:01,889
Well, that was
the big surprise.

157
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,957
Moving day
is today.

158
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:06,494
I had the movers
start packing us up

159
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:08,596
right after we left
on Thursday.

160
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,097
They're gonna be here
any minute.

161
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:10,931
(Girl laughs)

162
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,767
But you said we
were only looking.

163
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,803
How could you
do this to us?

164
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,505
Whoa, whoa.
It was a surprise.

165
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,507
It's okay. It's okay.
I'll take care of her.

166
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,508
Maddie?

167
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,842
Hey, come here.

168
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,878
(Birds chirping)

169
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,519
You have
to understand what
a step up this is.

170
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:34,187
You would never find
a house like this
in Brooklyn.

171
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,956
And besides,
your father's plant
is here.

172
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,125
He won't have
to fly down twice
a week anymore.

173
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,460
Don't you have
any say in anything?

174
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,566
You act like living
in this beautiful house

175
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,768
is some form
of punishment.

176
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,203
It's going
to be okay.

177
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:52,773
Hmm?

178
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,143
Okay.

179
00:08:00,548 --> 00:08:01,715
Look, it...

180
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:04,818
I really think
it can be different
this time, maddie.

181
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:07,254
I promise.

182
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:10,023
Your daddy's
finally happy here.

183
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:14,027
Come on. Can't you
just be happy, okay?

184
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:17,030
Be happy, okay?

185
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:20,167
Be happy. Yeah.

186
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,202
(Sighs)

187
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,272
(Movers talking
indistinctly)

188
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,812
Be careful
with my disco ball
there, all right?

189
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,581
- Absolutely.
- Take it easy.

190
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,082
Mover:
Take this.

191
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:38,085
We are planning to
buy new furniture,
right, daddy?

192
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:40,020
What's the matter?
I love that stuff.

193
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,856
All right,
that's it.

194
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,792
We are officially
moved in.

195
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:46,326
What do
you think?

196
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,629
It's a beaut,
right?

197
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,264
(Sighs)
Something's not
quite right.

198
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:52,800
Oh.

199
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,771
Now, it's perfect.

200
00:08:57,805 --> 00:08:59,339
- (Laughs)
- Come here.

201
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,341
- What's that?
- Joe: What's what?

202
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,677
That button.

203
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:04,912
Oh, that's
the panic button.

204
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,614
I installed them
everywhere.

205
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,115
You press
that button,

206
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,817
the precinct
is right down
the block.

207
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,852
The cops will
be here in less
than 30 seconds.

208
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,086
They told me
not to worry

209
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,287
about security,
you know,

210
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:15,789
but you don't tell
a guy from Brooklyn

211
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:17,124
not to worry
about security

212
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,592
when it comes
to his family.
Right, honey?

213
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,835
There's no way
we're going to fit in
at this school.

214
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,839
Maybe you won't,
but I will.

215
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:34,842
Joe, ask Natalie
to eat, please.

216
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:39,279
I'll give you
10 bucks if you finish
what's in your bowl.

217
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,682
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you
another 10 bucks

218
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:43,250
if you eat
two pieces of fruit.

219
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,885
- Don't bribe her.
- To you, it's a bribe.

220
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,386
To me,
it's a long-term
investment.

221
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,921
- (Horn honks)
- Okay? Come on.

222
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:51,659
The bus is here.

223
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:52,960
Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Come on.

224
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:55,195
Before you go,
come on.
Plant 'em.

225
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,001
- Ah.
- Pay up.

226
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:04,104
Come on. I give you
my iou, all right?

227
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:12,379
Have a good day.

228
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,648
Bye.

229
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,323
(Machinery clattering)

230
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,976
- Good morning, ladies.
- Morning.

231
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,678
Do my eyes deceive me,

232
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:46,880
or have I just walked
into a beauty pageant?

233
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:49,149
- (Laughter)
- Woman: Sweet talker.

234
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,418
What do you say to charm
like that, Mr. f, huh?

235
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:52,920
Do me a favor,
grace.

236
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,421
I want you
to call the bank

237
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,023
and confirm
the wire transfer
from crawley,

238
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,825
and get me Lenny
on the phone.

239
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:00,160
(School bell rings)

240
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,461
I'm Mr. Smith,

241
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,197
and this is
poetry seminar 111.

242
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,200
Before we begin
to tackle our curriculum

243
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:09,302
- for you budding poets...
- (Laughter)

244
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:10,938
I'd like to announce
that the sixth annual

245
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:13,473
Campbell soup
poetry competition

246
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,776
is now accepting
submissions.

247
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:18,746
This is an opportunity
for recognition,

248
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,047
prize money...

249
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,049
Perhaps a slice
of immortality.

250
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:23,216
(Laughter)

251
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,185
Here's everything
you need to know

252
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,219
about making
your submission.

253
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:28,155
Take one
and pass it along, please.

254
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,289
My advice,

255
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,892
stick with a topic
that's personal,

256
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,895
something that comes
from down deep in the soul.

257
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:37,197
Page 42
in your poetry books.

258
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,333
Let's tackle
a little eliot, shall we?

259
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:46,273
Natalie fine.

260
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:49,276
Why don't you start us off
reading "the waste land"?

261
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,278
Natalie:
I don't think anyone

262
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:52,880
should be asked
to read aloud

263
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,848
on their first day
in a new school.

264
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:56,349
Smith:
Miss fine?

265
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,385
And t.S. Eliot
was not my favorite.

266
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,087
Cat got your tongue,
miss fine?

267
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,421
(Laughter)

268
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,923
On the other hand,
let's face it.

269
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,424
I was a coward.

270
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,459
I hated reading
in front of people,

271
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:09,296
I hated speaking
in front of people,

272
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:10,998
and I never knew why.

273
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:13,166
I thought it might be
different here,

274
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,902
but it wasn't.

275
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,106
(School bell rings)

276
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,408
(Students talking
indistinctly)

277
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,781
- I don't know.
- Cindy's over here.

278
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:29,749
Hi.

279
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:35,222
Hey, if it isn't
the new girl in town.

280
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,124
I'm-I'm Louie.

281
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,926
- Maddie.
- Maddie.

282
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,794
I don't think
she likes what
she sees, Louie.

283
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:47,367
So, maddie,
you know, I hear...

284
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,137
I hear girls
from up north are
pretty friendly.

285
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,171
Is that true?

286
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,441
You got
something for me?

287
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:55,943
Oh, back off,
Louie.

288
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:57,477
Why you gotta be
such a jerk?

289
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,815
Can't you recognize
a lady when you see one?

290
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:03,851
Guess someone
down here's
a gentleman.

291
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:06,553
Sorry about that.
He's kind of an ass.

292
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,922
Hey, we're about
to go grab some
soft drinks downtown

293
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,290
if you want
to come with us.

294
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:11,591
I want
to go home.

295
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,561
Maybe next time.

296
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,096
All right.

297
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:18,465
Louie:
What was that?

298
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:20,901
What do you mean?
You can't just
go up to a stranger,

299
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,135
start touching 'em
on the leg.

300
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:23,570
- Dang, man.
- God, man. She's a Hebrew.

301
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:24,838
- Really?
- What does that mean?

302
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:35,916
(Seabirds calling)

303
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:45,592
(Stella laughing)

304
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,594
(Joe laughing)

305
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,629
Ah, it's just
a starter boat,

306
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,933
but I got my own
private slip to boot,
and I'll tell you what.

307
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,168
If you guys like it,
I got my eye
on a 40-footer.

308
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:57,170
But wait. Check out
the name over there.

309
00:13:57,204 --> 00:14:00,173
Oh! Joe.
Oh, Joe.

310
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:01,909
Oh, I hope you girls
have husbands

311
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,210
as wonderful
as your father.

312
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,378
(Parents laugh)

313
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:07,580
Maddie:
That water looks
very polluted.

314
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,082
It's not polluted.
It's muddy.

315
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:10,183
It's the
Mississippi river.

316
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:11,618
Come on.
Let's go for a ride.

317
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:12,419
- No? Really?
- Get in.

318
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:13,653
Well, no time
like the present.

319
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,022
- Joe, Joe...
- Get in, girls.

320
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:16,223
Are you sure you know
how to drive this?

321
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,125
Of course I know
how to drive.

322
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:19,559
It's a car
on water. What's
the difference?

323
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,994
It goes left.
It goes right.

324
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:21,995
It stops.
It goes.

325
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,296
I can do it.

326
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,998
Here.
How's that look?

327
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:28,001
Oh, doesn't your
father look dapper?

328
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,536
(Laughs)

329
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,038
Here we go.
All right.

330
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,006
Let's get ready.
Are you ready,
maddie?

331
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,174
- We're in.
- All right.

332
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,475
Good catch, honey.

333
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,410
You watch me
take control
of this boat.

334
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:39,446
I can't believe it.
A Brooklyn Jew
on the bayou.

335
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:40,948
Be careful, Joe.

336
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:43,083
Don't worry.
I was in the war,
don't forget.

337
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:45,652
Whoa. It's all right.
I'm okay.

338
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,687
All right, I got
my girls with me.

339
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,957
I'm all set to go.
Here we go.

340
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,691
Maddie, listen,
I'm going to get you

341
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,561
a pair of water skis,
all right, for the boat.

342
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,063
- Really?
- Yes.

343
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,931
- Water skis?
- Water skis.

344
00:14:57,965 --> 00:14:59,299
All right, here we go.

345
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,333
I got it.

346
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,469
Whoa.

347
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,371
All right. Okay.

348
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,239
- It's... I just...
- (Laughing)

349
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,675
Just take it easy.
I got it. I got it.

350
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,111
Just... all right.
You know what? I need
a little hand here.

351
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,346
All right, look,
you got your chuckle
out of the way.

352
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,182
Look, I need a hand
up in front, okay?

353
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:17,250
Okay, maddie, you're fore.
You're aft.

354
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:18,485
Come on. Come on.
No, no.

355
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:20,954
Come on. Don't you guys
know the difference?

356
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:23,090
I said
fore and aft.

357
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:25,325
- Really. Come on.
- We're so happy.

358
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:28,161
Thank you for
the boat and the house
and everything.

359
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,662
We appreciate it.

360
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:30,964
All right, honey,
sit down.

361
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:32,599
Let's get going.
I want you to sit down.

362
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:35,035
We got to get ready.
All right, here we go.

363
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:36,636
I got it. All right.

364
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,006
That's it. I got it.

365
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,713
Natalie:
Maybe everything
wasn't different,

366
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,983
but it felt like the start
of something good.

367
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:52,052
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

368
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,553
Joe:
You just watch
daddy do it.

369
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,055
Ah, look at that.

370
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:56,456
(Laughs)

371
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:57,991
Go ahead.
You can do it.

372
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:00,060
Ha! You made it.

373
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:02,062
Do it again.
You shoot again.
Go ahead.

374
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:03,063
- Again?
- That's right.

375
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:04,131
- No, no.
- I go again?

376
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:05,765
No, put
a little more chalk
on it. Try that.

377
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,634
- Okay.
- Yeah, put a little
more chalk.

378
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,736
Go ahead.
You can do it, then.

379
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:12,472
All right. Go ahead.

380
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:13,773
You're a pro.

381
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,208
You're going
to be a pro.

382
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:16,409
Let me tell you
something.

383
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,779
No, seriously,
it didn't go in,

384
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,481
but that was
a hell of a shot.

385
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:24,017
(Rock music playing)

386
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,054
Buddy,
what do you think?

387
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,657
Do I look Southern
to you, buddy?

388
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,192
(Laughs)

389
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,028
Good boy.

390
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:47,507
Lenny, what are you
doing down here?

391
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,808
Hey, how are you?

392
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,643
You weren't
supposed to be here
for another week.

393
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:51,711
Let me
tell you something.

394
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,713
You better
think about staying
down here for good,

395
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,415
because since
I came down here,

396
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,584
yeah, I got
to tell you, Lenny,

397
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,419
I am having
the time of my life.

398
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,189
What's the matter?

399
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,558
Joe, I got
some news.

400
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,094
What news?

401
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,064
Crawley backed out
of the deal.

402
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,234
What are you
talking about?

403
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:17,070
He just decided
it was taking
too big a risk

404
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:19,172
with the overseas
competition being
what it is.

405
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,210
Yeah, all right.
So just get him
on the phone.

406
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:24,611
I'll talk him
into it.

407
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,279
Ah, nah, nah.
He's on a plane
to London.

408
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:28,248
He's out
of the country,
out of the deal.

409
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,817
I'll sue
the bastard.

410
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,555
Business
is dying, Joe.

411
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:36,856
We did
nothing wrong.

412
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,326
We just got to accept
what's happening here.

413
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,327
No, no, no.

414
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,262
I did everything
you told me to do

415
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,464
before crawley ever
entered the equation.

416
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,566
Okay?
I cut distribution.

417
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,169
I moved my whole
goddamn plant down South.

418
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:51,704
I uprooted my family,
for Christ sakes.

419
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:54,507
You told me that's
all I needed to do
to keep us going.

420
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:58,111
Things deteriorated
faster than we could
have imagined.

421
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:03,483
30 years I've been
in this goddamn game,

422
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:06,219
and I gotta deal
with this crap?

423
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:09,589
You put the house
in Stella's name?

424
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,491
The insurance
I talked about?

425
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:14,194
We declare bankruptcy,
anything in your name
is at risk.

426
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:17,830
They go after you
personally, Joe.

427
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:21,168
It was
a good run, Joe.

428
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:23,703
I mean, they can't
take that away from us.

429
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:27,307
Well, excuse me
if I don't share
your sentimentality.

430
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,676
I already
called shuster.

431
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,711
I said it looked like
we'd be taking
their offer.

432
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,913
It's a decent
offer, Joe.

433
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,816
What? What, to buy us out
as a tax deduction?

434
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,785
Pennies
on the dollar?

435
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:41,388
We still got
kimball out in D.C.
lobbying for us.

436
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:43,690
He gets the Southern
tax incentive,

437
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,725
that's it.

438
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,560
We got it made, then.
Come on.

439
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,896
But we can't
count on that, Joe.

440
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,732
Besides, we got
a bird in the hand
with shuster.

441
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:54,234
Forget shuster.

442
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,736
We got to keep our eye
on the ball here, Lenny.

443
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:01,274
We step it up
with kimball.

444
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,476
We get the media
involved,

445
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,944
see if we get
a few more lobbyists

446
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,713
to jump
on the bandwagon.

447
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,915
Because once this thing
passes, Lenny,

448
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:10,883
we are the only game
in town.

449
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:14,554
You see how easy it is
to come up with
the negatives?

450
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,922
Huh?
You see that?

451
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,424
Solutions, my friend.

452
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,192
Yeah.

453
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:22,195
Come on now.
Solutions.

454
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:23,830
That's what I'm
looking for now, Lenny.

455
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,365
All right, pal.
All right.

456
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,874
(Telephone dial
clicking)

457
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:42,949
(Line rings)

458
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:45,952
- Man: Hello.
- Hey, Bobby.

459
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,754
Yeah,
it's Joe fine.

460
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,989
No, I'm good. Good.
How you doing?

461
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,692
Listen,
I need a favor.

462
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,761
TV reporter:
With the recession
in full force

463
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:57,964
and the jobless rate
continuing to escalate
along with inflation,

464
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,799
president Ford has turned
to his advisors for...

465
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,301
Maddie:
Daddy,

466
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:03,236
I could be starting
to like it here.

467
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,506
I made some
new friends
at school,

468
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,740
and I was
wondering...

469
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:08,975
Yeah, I'm just
trying to watch this.

470
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,410
Okay, but I just
was wondering

471
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:11,944
if maybe
this weekend...

472
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:13,846
I know. I just
can't hear this,
all right?

473
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,016
Can we please
take a few girls out
on the boat on Sunday?

474
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,951
Natalie:
How come we never
eat real vegetables,

475
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:20,353
only things from cans?

476
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:21,821
Joe:
You know what?
It's burnt.

477
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:23,756
Really, you know
I don't like when
it's burnt.

478
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,592
I'll get you
a can of tuna fish.

479
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,294
No, I don't want
no tuna fish.

480
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:28,595
Get me nothing.
I'm fine. I'm okay.

481
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:30,430
Even our fish
comes in cans.

482
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:33,032
Dad, I'm just really
trying to fit in here.

483
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,768
All right,
all right, just
what is it you want?

484
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:38,271
I told you. I want
to take a few girls out

485
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:39,972
on the boat Sunday
for a couple of hours.

486
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:41,841
Maybe it's not
such a bad idea.

487
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:45,578
Well, I'm playing
golf on Sunday,
okay, so forget it.

488
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,414
You guys both
want me to make
friends, right?

489
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,282
I don't understand.
We have this boat.

490
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:50,317
It's
the perfect way.

491
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,818
Enough with
the boat, okay?

492
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,553
Your father's
had a long day.

493
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,054
Mom, he's not even
listening to me.

494
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,590
(Snaps)
Enough with
the goddamn boat!

495
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:59,659
All right?

496
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:04,331
I ever talked
to my father like that,

497
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:05,765
he'd put a strap
to me.

498
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:08,034
You're ungrateful.

499
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:11,938
All of you.

500
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:16,743
(Door closes)

501
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,378
You said
it was over, mom.

502
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:28,087
Joe:
I don't know how much
more of this I can stand.

503
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,557
Stella:
Of what?

504
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,626
(Joe speaks
indistinctly)

505
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,828
I mean, it's your fault.
You raised them

506
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:39,098
as loudmouthed,
spoiled little brats.

507
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,901
Natalie:
Every family
has its secrets.

508
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:44,571
For us,
it was my father's rage.

509
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:47,407
It plagued us
our entire lives,

510
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,708
and what was worse,

511
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:51,444
my mom
would take his side.

512
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,580
It was almost like
if she said anything
against him,

513
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:55,081
she'd wake up
and find herself

514
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:56,683
back in her hiding place
in Europe.

515
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:00,119
Her big job
was keeping dad,

516
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,888
the monster,
in his cave.

517
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,056
(Joe yelling)

518
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:07,460
I used to dream that I
was the reincarnation
of Anne Frank.

519
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:10,096
I mean,
what Jewish girl didn't?

520
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:11,698
How'd she do it,
anyway?

521
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:13,700
In spite of everything
she lived through,

522
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:16,436
she still thought
people were "good at heart."

523
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:19,739
(Light clattering)

524
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,056
I'm glad
we're all together.

525
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:40,092
Your father has
something he wants
to say to you.

526
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:45,498
Joe?

527
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,967
I know my behavior hasn't
been that great lately,

528
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,802
and I just want
to say that I have...

529
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:51,504
I've had
some work issues,

530
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,172
and they've been
getting to me,

531
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,907
and I apologize.

532
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,111
Okay, daddy.
We get it.

533
00:23:01,448 --> 00:23:02,782
All right.
Ahem.

534
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:07,787
What is wrong
with you?

535
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,523
How can you just
forgive him like that?

536
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,492
Joe:
You know,
I've been thinking.

537
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:13,726
What do you say
we, like...

538
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,161
You know, we'll go
out to dinner tonight.

539
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:17,797
I'll take you all out
to dinner, like,
you know, a family,

540
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,466
like we used
to do.

541
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:21,167
I vote for Chinese.

542
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,135
I have plans.

543
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:25,404
Well, just cancel them.
That's easy enough, right?

544
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:39,652
Maddie, your father is
sorry for what he does.

545
00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:42,622
You have to think of it
like a sickness.

546
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,624
What if he had cancer?

547
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:46,125
Mom, he doesn't
have cancer.

548
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,193
He is the cancer.

549
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,762
Don't you
ever say anything
like that again.

550
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:51,998
No matter what he
does, he is still
your father.

551
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:53,500
He's a great man.

552
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:55,668
Are we even living
under the same roof?

553
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:57,203
He takes care of us.

554
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:58,938
He protects us.

555
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,944
Joe:
Girls!

556
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:08,014
So you know what?

557
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:09,782
Listen, forget
what I just said.

558
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:12,785
Let's have
a nice barbecue
at the house tonight.

559
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,687
That would be nice.

560
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:16,623
All right.

561
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:26,165
Radio:
* you are my candy girl

562
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:29,769
* and you got me
wanting you *

563
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:32,872
* I just can't believe...

564
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:34,674
Natalie:
Some things never change.

565
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:37,276
Maddie worked on her tan
by the pool

566
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,279
waiting for the stud
in shining armor
to come back.

567
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,583
* ...Believe the wonder
of this feeling too *

568
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:46,653
* I just can't
believe it's true *

569
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:48,020
* ah, sugar...

570
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:51,023
- Hey.
- Hey, what's going on?

571
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:52,592
Natalie:
I sat in the shade

572
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:55,061
working on my poem
for the soup contest.

573
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,532
Teacher said
make it personal.

574
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:02,535
Dangerous.
It was very tempting.

575
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:04,070
* ah, honey

576
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:07,540
* ah, sugar, sugar

577
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:09,942
would any guy
ever look at me like that?

578
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:11,578
* you are
my candy... *

579
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,622
my poem sucks.

580
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:24,657
Oh, I'm sure
it's beautiful.

581
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:27,627
If only I could have
been born poverty-stricken
or survived a war

582
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,630
or overcame
some dreaded disease
at birth.

583
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:32,665
Bite your tongue.

584
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:35,267
I haven't suffered
nearly enough to be
a really good poet.

585
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:37,003
Poets don't
have to suffer.

586
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,906
Mom, the best writers
are tortured alcoholics,

587
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:42,074
and it's not like
I drink or anything.

588
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:44,577
Ah, that's good to know.
(Chuckles)

589
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:46,345
And what about
your sister?

590
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,815
I worry about her.

591
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:52,284
Are you going to invite
the new boyfriend
to dinner?

592
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,955
Ah, I haven't
thought about that.

593
00:25:57,824 --> 00:25:59,926
Did you see
the jumbo cross?

594
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:02,829
Ah, well, we are
open-minded people.

595
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,132
- You are?
- Ah, yeah.

596
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:07,667
She's not going
to marry him.

597
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:12,171
Well, you'll be glad
to know that you're
still married

598
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:14,306
to a scratch golfer.

599
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,975
- Where's maddie?
- I don't know.

600
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:17,810
She's out at the pool
with her new boyfriend.

601
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:18,945
(Chuckles)

602
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:21,047
Wait. There's
a strange guy
in my pool?

603
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,382
(Laughs)
He's nice too.

604
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,752
- (Door opens)
- (Laughter)

605
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:28,120
Daddy.
You're home early.

606
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:30,189
So this is
the guy that was
in the pool?

607
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:31,758
His name's Earl.
He was just leaving.

608
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:32,759
How you
doing, sir?

609
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:34,193
Earl. Great.

610
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:35,828
- How you doing, sir?
- He was just leaving.

611
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:37,329
Hey, Earl.
How you doing?

612
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:39,365
- Very nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you too, Earl.

613
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:41,367
Yeah, it's nice.
Why don't you
sit down?

614
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,401
I want
to talk to you.

615
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,036
No, no, no.
It's okay, yeah?

616
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,171
- Sit down. Come on.
- Stella: Joseph.

617
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:46,806
It's a little game
I like to play.

618
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:47,840
Come on.
It's all right.

619
00:26:47,874 --> 00:26:49,642
Stay out of this,
Stella.

620
00:26:49,676 --> 00:26:51,210
Don't worry about it.
Here.

621
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,681
What's the matter?
You can't take an old man?

622
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:55,581
- Dad.
- Joseph.

623
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,950
It's all right.
Relax. Relax, maddie.

624
00:26:57,984 --> 00:27:01,654
Now, I warn you,
I do 100 push-ups
every day, you know.

625
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:02,554
He's just playing.

626
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:04,256
Mind your business now,
please, all right?

627
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,692
It's all right.
It's all right.

628
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:06,726
Now just look
in my eyes.

629
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:08,160
Look me in the eyes.
Ready?

630
00:27:08,194 --> 00:27:10,162
1, 2, 3.

631
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:17,670
Hey, you will
never disrespect
my daughter, right?

632
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:18,771
- Dad!
- Of course not.

633
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:20,039
You're never going
to offend me, right?

634
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:21,741
- No, sir.
- Say it.

635
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:22,975
- "I will never..."
- I will never...

636
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:23,976
"Disrespect..."

637
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,077
- Disrespect...
- Dad!

638
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:26,779
- Me.
- You.

639
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:32,184
All right.
That's not bad,

640
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:33,452
but I think
the guys in Brooklyn

641
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,154
would have put up
a better fight.

642
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:36,756
Are you
serious, sir?

643
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,725
I'm so sorry.
Come on.

644
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,061
I'm so sorry.

645
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,732
Joseph.

646
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:46,999
What?

647
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:49,401
Why would you do
a thing like that
to your own daughter?

648
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:51,704
Huh? She's finally
happy here,

649
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:53,706
and boyfriends are
gonna come and go.

650
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,742
Yeah, well, this one
better go fast.

651
00:27:55,775 --> 00:27:57,076
You see that earring
in his ear?

652
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,778
I mean, come on.

653
00:27:58,811 --> 00:28:00,913
And that cross
around his neck?
It's big as my fist.

654
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:04,751
Come on. I mean,

655
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:06,853
I'm protecting her,
okay?

656
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:08,788
I'm protecting her.

657
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:13,259
Is he always
like that?

658
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:15,694
You don't even
want to know.

659
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:25,872
So I'll see you
on Monday?

660
00:28:27,106 --> 00:28:28,808
You bet.

661
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:42,822
Natalie:
It was the weekend,

662
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:44,456
and I was still
stuck on my poem,

663
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,125
which I hated
more than ever.

664
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:49,128
Anyone who wanted to be
in the contest and win $500

665
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:51,764
had to submit
their first draft
the following week.

666
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:53,065
(Knock on door)

667
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,935
- Maddie.
- Hmm?

668
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:58,838
Hey, come on.
We're going
on a day trip.

669
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:00,006
- Oh, my God.
- Put on something nice.

670
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:02,842
You guys sleep
half the day away.
Let's go. Come on.

671
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,881
Natalie:
I was at war
with imperfection.

672
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:11,083
I hated everything
I wrote.

673
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:13,552
It was a war
with imperfection.

674
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,555
A tug of war
with imperfection.

675
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,257
You know what?
That's not bad.

676
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,492
Natalie, come on.
Let's go.

677
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:22,528
But I have to present
my poem Monday.

678
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:25,297
Natalie, come on.
All work and no play
is not good.

679
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:26,833
We got to go.

680
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,073
Where do you think
he's taking us?

681
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,508
Girls, let's
get moving.

682
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:38,510
Please tell us
what's going on.

683
00:29:38,544 --> 00:29:40,346
I'm not going to
tell you where
we're going,

684
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,548
but I'll show
you how we're
getting there.

685
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:44,783
Come here.

686
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:47,419
- (Laughs)
- Joe: Look at that.

687
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:48,520
Maddie:
I call shotgun.

688
00:29:48,554 --> 00:29:50,489
Joe:
Is that beautiful or what?
We are going in style.

689
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:51,924
Where did you get
the rolls, dad?

690
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:53,860
My own driver Sam
hooked me up.

691
00:29:53,893 --> 00:29:56,863
Just be ready.
Five minutes.
Come on, let's go.

692
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:03,936
Evening, Mr. fine.

693
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,172
Hey, thanks for
making this night
so special, Sam.

694
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:07,874
Oh, you're welcome, sir.

695
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:09,308
The girls will be
down in a minute.

696
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:10,843
Okay.

697
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:15,948
(Gasps)
It's so amazing.

698
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:17,917
This is
so exciting.

699
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:26,158
Ah. Ladies, meet Sam.

700
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:27,326
Evening, ladies.

701
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,528
- Hey.
- Where are we going?

702
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,130
Well, let's put it
this way.

703
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,631
The guy's
a musical legend.

704
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,633
When he sings,
the girls go crazy,

705
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,904
and he dances up
a storm.

706
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:39,138
(Girls gasp)

707
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,439
Natalie:
I can't believe it.

708
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:41,874
I've been waiting
forever to see him.

709
00:30:41,908 --> 00:30:42,875
Maddie:
Oh, my gosh.

710
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:44,276
Could you
contain yourself?

711
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,112
Maddie, I can't believe
we're going to see him.

712
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:48,514
- Woman: I'm so excited.
- I know. It's amazing.

713
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:52,018
Natalie:
I am so excited.

714
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:53,552
All right.

715
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:56,889
Sam, why don't
you come inside
to see the show?

716
00:30:56,923 --> 00:30:58,257
That's a pretty
exclusive club,
sir.

717
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,558
Listen,
you're a negro.
I'm a Jew.

718
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,895
It's not like they're
going to be happy to see
either one of us.

719
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:04,196
It's about time
us bottom-feeders

720
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,898
move up the food chain.
Come on.

721
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:07,934
This is
going to be a night
you'll never forget.

722
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:09,235
That's what
I'm afraid of.

723
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:10,937
(Both laugh)

724
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,438
Man:
What's taking them
so long?

725
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:14,473
(Laughter)

726
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:17,509
Look at the line.

727
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,946
Poor bastards
probably been
here all night.

728
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:21,480
Follow me.

729
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:27,453
Joe fine, party of four,
with a guest.

730
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:31,023
Oh, Mr. fine.
Pleasure to meet you.

731
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:32,324
You're
on our v.I.P. List.

732
00:31:32,358 --> 00:31:34,260
- Right this way, sir.
- V.I.P. List?

733
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:37,964
(Laughter)

734
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:40,166
I'm telling you
this is going
to be some show.

735
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:42,701
Look at this.
Is this place
something or what?

736
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,037
Sam:
This is something else.

737
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:48,240
Your private box,
Mr. fine.

738
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:50,009
All right.
Look at this.

739
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:51,510
Wow. Dad!

740
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:53,245
- Oh, my gosh.
- All right.

741
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,947
Whoa.

742
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:58,484
This is
the good life.

743
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:01,353
Joe:
Can't get better
seats than this.

744
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:04,056
They're never going
to forget this.

745
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:07,059
You know what, honey?
Why don't you order
a couple of Martinis

746
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:08,727
and get the girls
some Shirley temples?

747
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,429
And, Sam, you get
something too, okay?

748
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:11,663
Okay,
thank you, sir.

749
00:32:11,697 --> 00:32:13,165
- Where are you going?
- I got a meeting

750
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:15,234
to go to. I'll be back
before the main event.

751
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,602
- Don't worry.
- A meeting with who?

752
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:18,370
Sam, you take care
of the girls, all right?

753
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:20,106
Sure thing,
Mr. fine.

754
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:30,049
(Knocking on door)

755
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:37,023
I'm here
to see Bobby.

756
00:32:37,056 --> 00:32:38,657
Hey, is
this really
a body shop,

757
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,226
or is this just
your cover here?

758
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,129
I got a Cadillac,

759
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:45,697
you know, could use
a little tlc.

760
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:47,699
Maybe you guys could
look at it sometime.

761
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:52,138
Hey, hey, hey, Joe fine.
Glad you could make it.

762
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:53,739
Hey, Bob.
How are you?

763
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,307
Doesn't say much,
does he?

764
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:58,010
He's got
other qualities.
Follow me.

765
00:32:58,044 --> 00:32:59,311
Yeah. I bet.
(Chuckles)

766
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:02,314
(Audience murmuring)

767
00:33:02,348 --> 00:33:04,350
(Audience cheering)

768
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:07,086
Where's dad? The show
is about to start.

769
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,087
Something's
wrong.

770
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,388
Nothing is wrong,
damn it.

771
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:12,024
Why don't I go out
and take a look
around for him?

772
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:13,059
Oh, no,
no, just sit down.

773
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:14,326
Sit down.

774
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,096
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,

775
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:21,767
the roxy is proud
to present the king
of rock 'n' roll!

776
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,701
(Cheering)

777
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,603
- (Dice rattle)
- Let's go. Let's go.

778
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:27,406
You got them tickets
I sent you, right?

779
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:30,042
Yeah. You really
came through for me
big time, Bobby.

780
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:31,543
The kids
are in heaven.

781
00:33:31,577 --> 00:33:33,512
Well, that's a good thing,
right?

782
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:34,813
Okay, have a seat
right here, Joe.

783
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,283
I'm going to see
if the big guy
is ready for you.

784
00:33:38,284 --> 00:33:39,751
Take care
of my boy.

785
00:33:39,785 --> 00:33:41,420
You give him
anything he wants.
I'm buying.

786
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,157
Give me
a scotch, neat.

787
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:46,392
* oh, my God

788
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:47,826
* can you see

789
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,162
* that I've got a chick
that's into me? *

790
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:51,663
* she wanna do it

791
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,065
* yeah

792
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:55,067
* she wanna do it, uh-huh

793
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:57,269
* she wanna do it...

794
00:33:57,303 --> 00:34:01,140
(Overlapping
conversations)

795
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:03,075
Bobby:
Hey, Joe.

796
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,245
Battelli is ready
to see you now.

797
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:08,147
Thanks for making
the introduction,
Bobby.

798
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,581
I'm always here for you.
You know that.

799
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:11,117
All right.

800
00:34:18,857 --> 00:34:21,660
No sense in wasting
a good drink.

801
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:23,295
* she was
a real wild child *

802
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:25,131
* she wanted
to do it, yeah *

803
00:34:25,164 --> 00:34:28,100
* she wanted to do it,
oh, yeah *

804
00:34:28,134 --> 00:34:29,835
* she wanted to do it

805
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:31,703
* do it night and day.

806
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:37,443
Natalie:
My dad missed
the whole show.

807
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:39,745
Where the hell was he?

808
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:40,879
- Oh, thank God.
- Hey.

809
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,348
Natalie:
He took so long

810
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:43,849
that I finished my poem
and fell asleep.

811
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:45,351
Where are the kids?
They're up?

812
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:48,254
We were
worried sick.

813
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:49,755
You missed him,
daddy.

814
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:51,390
He was fatter
than I thought
he'd be.

815
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,125
(Laughs)
Listen, Sam,

816
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,161
thanks for
taking care of
the girls, all right?

817
00:34:55,194 --> 00:34:56,828
Why don't you go
get the car, pull it
out in front?

818
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:58,530
- Sure thing.
- All right.

819
00:34:58,564 --> 00:35:00,232
What were you
doing?

820
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:01,533
What was I doing?

821
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:04,136
This is what I was
doing, right here.

822
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,437
Where did you
get that?

823
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:07,473
Never mind where I got it.
The night is young.

824
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:09,175
Come on,
let's go party more.

825
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:11,210
Come on, let's go.
(Laughs)

826
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:13,279
All right,
come on, girls.
Here we go.

827
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:14,780
Natalie:
It wasn't until later

828
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:17,283
that I realized
we'd been bought off.

829
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:19,185
(Chuckles)

830
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:23,222
I haven't
seen you this happy
in such a long time.

831
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:26,192
Ah, what's there
not to be happy
about, right?

832
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:29,195
New home,

833
00:35:29,228 --> 00:35:32,198
new life.
It's great.

834
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:33,899
You know, I got
something for you.

835
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:36,635
Oh, no. What more
could you get me? No.

836
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:38,370
I got something
for you.

837
00:35:38,404 --> 00:35:41,340
I didn't get
a chance to buy you
an engagement ring

838
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:42,841
when we first
got married.

839
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,810
Mm, you got me one
a few years later.

840
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:46,712
But it... that was
not even a carat.

841
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:48,714
Come on, baby.
That was like a token.

842
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:53,385
- Here.
- Oh, no, Joseph.

843
00:35:53,419 --> 00:35:56,922
This is
an engagement ring.

844
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:58,457
Here. Give me...

845
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:04,796
Oh, my God.

846
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,298
It's huge.

847
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:07,933
(Both laugh)

848
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:09,635
Oh, God.

849
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,603
Are you sure
we can afford this?

850
00:36:11,637 --> 00:36:13,439
Of course
we can afford it.

851
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:16,208
I worked
my whole life
for this, okay?

852
00:36:16,242 --> 00:36:17,543
(Laughs)

853
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:21,447
You let me do this
for you, okay?

854
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,315
I love you,
Stella.

855
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:24,850
- I love you.
- You hear me?

856
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:26,385
I love you.

857
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:33,259
Hey.

858
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:34,593
Hey, hey,
get over here.

859
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:36,595
- Come here.
- How are you?

860
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:38,930
What's the news?
You fly me down here
on a Saturday,

861
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:40,432
it must be something
pretty big.

862
00:36:40,466 --> 00:36:42,000
Oh, this is big.

863
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,802
Something
to celebrate.

864
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:45,304
Cubans,
your favorite.

865
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:47,306
Go ahead.

866
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:50,309
Thanks. You going
to tell me what
we're celebrating?

867
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:52,744
Let's take
a walk.

868
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:55,747
What would you say
if I told you that we
have enough money

869
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:58,384
to keep us solvent
for the next
eight months?

870
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:00,852
I'd ask you
what bank you robbed.

871
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:02,321
I got a loan.

872
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:04,256
- A bank loan?
- "Bank loan." Come on.

873
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:06,458
Had a 10-year relationship
with Manny hanning.

874
00:37:06,492 --> 00:37:08,894
The first sign
of trouble, they stop
returning my calls.

875
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:10,396
(Scoffs)

876
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:12,931
So where'd you get
the loan, Joe?

877
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,233
I got it.

878
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,304
Who are
these guys?

879
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:21,373
Is it a mob loan?

880
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:22,274
(Chuckles)

881
00:37:22,308 --> 00:37:24,610
Ah, Jesus, Joe.

882
00:37:24,643 --> 00:37:27,379
We always steered clear
of those ganefs.

883
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:29,047
Besides, we got
a decent offer
from shuster.

884
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,749
The guy's chomping
at the bit.

885
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:32,618
Come on. Come on.
Don't embarrass me

886
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:34,320
with his lowball offer,
okay?

887
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:35,621
You're playing
with fire, Joe.

888
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:38,357
Look, plans are
coming together
down in D.C.

889
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:41,360
Come on. As soon
as the legislation votes
on the Southern tax trade,

890
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:42,694
we're home free.

891
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:44,396
And what if
it doesn't?

892
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,031
Come on. You think
I got where I have

893
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:47,666
without taking
some prudent risks?

894
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:51,303
Prudent?
We've both seen what
those people could do.

895
00:37:51,337 --> 00:37:54,373
You forgot
Bernie weinstein,
that poor bastard, huh?

896
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:56,842
They broke his legs
for a deuce.

897
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,777
The guy still
walks around
with a limp.

898
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,679
Weinstein was
a smug son of a bitch.

899
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:02,381
I don't know anybody
who wasn't happy

900
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:05,384
the day he got
his legs broke, okay?

901
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:08,053
Joe, listen to me.

902
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:10,622
30 years
you kept a roof over
my family's head,

903
00:38:10,656 --> 00:38:13,325
what we ate.
You educated
my people.

904
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,362
I tell you this
with all due respect.

905
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:20,966
I think you're
kidding yourself.

906
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:22,501
I'm kidding myself?

907
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:26,638
If I don't tell you,
who would?

908
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:28,574
You know what, Lenny?
You're right.

909
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:31,443
20 years, I been
carrying you on my back.

910
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:32,944
You always been
a taker

911
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,780
and, right now,
a little bit of a coward.

912
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:38,384
Ah...

913
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:41,353
Look, I know
you don't mean that.

914
00:38:41,387 --> 00:38:43,922
Look, we both got
a family, Joe.

915
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,557
Think of your girls.

916
00:38:45,591 --> 00:38:48,360
I'm doing it for my girls,
you horse's ass!

917
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:50,128
Joe, listen to me.

918
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,498
No, you listen
to me.

919
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:55,501
You know what?
Just get the fuck out.

920
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:57,736
Really.
Just get the fuck out

921
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:00,071
before I do something
I don't want to do.

922
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:18,890
Natalie:
When it rains,

923
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:22,027
it really pours
in Louisiana.

924
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:25,531
After buddy's back legs
gave out...

925
00:39:25,564 --> 00:39:27,466
Don't worry, buddy.

926
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:30,469
This is like
the best vet
in the whole South.

927
00:39:30,502 --> 00:39:32,938
I insisted my parents
take him to a specialist.

928
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:35,407
(Thunder rumbling)

929
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:39,445
All right, well...

930
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:40,746
How much time
do I got

931
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:42,448
before he can't
even walk again?

932
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:43,949
You know, give me
a ballpark figure.

933
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:46,618
There really is
no way to tell
for sure.

934
00:39:50,456 --> 00:39:52,924
Well, what are
the options?

935
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:56,428
Well,
he is suffering

936
00:39:56,462 --> 00:39:59,898
and in some pain.

937
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:03,034
We could
put him down now,

938
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:04,503
or you could
take him home

939
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:06,738
and I could
give him something.

940
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:10,476
But either way,
I suggest you
think about it.

941
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:16,448
(Buddy whimpers)

942
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:21,453
Well, I thought
about it.

943
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:23,755
I think we should
put him down.

944
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:26,024
Daddy, please!

945
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:28,460
You think he wants
to be remembered
like this, huh? Sick?

946
00:40:28,494 --> 00:40:31,530
No, you can't!

947
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:32,831
Mom?!

948
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:34,533
Let's just
think about it.

949
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:35,834
We don't have
to decide today.

950
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:37,769
Look, could you just
back me up sometimes

951
00:40:37,803 --> 00:40:40,639
so I don't have
to be the bad guy
all the time?

952
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:43,041
Just give us a minute
to say goodbye, doc,
all right?

953
00:40:45,844 --> 00:40:48,580
No. Please, daddy.
Please.

954
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:50,215
It's for
his own damn good.

955
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:51,249
And what about
maddie?

956
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,952
She won't even
get a chance
to say goodbye.

957
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:56,555
No, you can't.

958
00:40:56,588 --> 00:41:00,526
You can't do this.
I won't let you. No.

959
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:03,629
Stop the hysteria,
or I'm going to tell you
to wait in the fucking car.

960
00:41:03,662 --> 00:41:05,664
(Sobbing)

961
00:41:32,758 --> 00:41:34,793
You had to see him.

962
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:37,696
He would never
have been able
to bring buddy back.

963
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:39,197
We had
to do it then.

964
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,733
Bullshit.
He does what he wants.

965
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:43,935
He doesn't care
what anybody else thinks.

966
00:41:45,637 --> 00:41:47,606
Why are you lying
for him, Natalie?

967
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:49,808
Tell me the truth.
I'm your sister.

968
00:41:51,977 --> 00:41:54,580
I tried
to stop him,

969
00:41:54,613 --> 00:41:56,715
but you know
how nuts he gets,

970
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:59,217
and I'm not as brave
as you are.

971
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:11,630
Natalie:
When I finally had
to present my poem,

972
00:42:11,663 --> 00:42:13,765
I couldn't do it.

973
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:16,301
What had seemed
like genius to me

974
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:19,571
was now gibberish.

975
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:25,310
Natalie?

976
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:27,312
I hated myself.

977
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:29,347
I hated him.

978
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,018
I hated anyone
who ever dared to rhyme.

979
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,953
I can't.

980
00:42:53,772 --> 00:42:56,041
Natalie:
My mom would say,

981
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,810
"time heals all wounds."

982
00:42:58,844 --> 00:43:01,647
She taught us to believe
in any rosy cliche

983
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,948
where we could
fill in the blanks.

984
00:43:02,981 --> 00:43:04,616
In this case,

985
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:07,653
time meant
the two-week period

986
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:11,289
leading up
to maddie's birthday.

987
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:14,025
(Shutter clicks)

988
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:15,260
Happy Birthday!

989
00:43:15,293 --> 00:43:17,162
- Stella: Happy Birthday!
- All right.

990
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:18,664
Are you ready
for your present?

991
00:43:18,697 --> 00:43:19,698
Yeah.

992
00:43:23,702 --> 00:43:25,403
Happy Birthday.

993
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,138
No, it's yours.

994
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:32,077
(Squeals)
Oh, my gosh!

995
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,378
It's all
yours, honey.
You deserve it.

996
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:35,146
Daddy,
thank you so much.

997
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,648
Mama, thank you.

998
00:43:36,682 --> 00:43:38,149
Only the best
for my girl.

999
00:43:38,183 --> 00:43:40,786
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.

1000
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:47,225
Okay, all right,
here's the lights
right here.

1001
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:48,727
- Mm-hmm.
- All right. You watching?

1002
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,228
- I'm watching.
- Okay. All right.

1003
00:43:50,261 --> 00:43:51,730
All right.
Here's the air.

1004
00:43:51,763 --> 00:43:53,164
- Okay.
- You got to just move that.

1005
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:54,432
And here's
the eight-track,

1006
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,067
but, please, no music
while you're driving, okay?

1007
00:43:56,101 --> 00:43:57,235
- Okay, daddy.
- All right.

1008
00:43:57,268 --> 00:43:58,369
All right,
here we go.

1009
00:43:58,403 --> 00:43:59,871
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1010
00:43:59,905 --> 00:44:01,372
- (Engine grinds)
- Start it?

1011
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:02,974
- Yes. Go ahead.
- (Engine starts)

1012
00:44:07,713 --> 00:44:09,014
That's it.

1013
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:11,049
Good. Good.
Very good.

1014
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:13,351
Just go straight.
You like this car, huh?

1015
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:14,753
- I love it.
- All right.

1016
00:44:14,786 --> 00:44:16,054
Just keep
going straight.

1017
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:17,689
That's it.
Okay.

1018
00:44:17,723 --> 00:44:19,124
All right, easy,
easy, easy on the gas.

1019
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,391
Okay, daddy.

1020
00:44:20,425 --> 00:44:22,093
I passed
my driver's test,
you know.

1021
00:44:22,127 --> 00:44:24,362
Yes, I know.
That doesn't make you
a driver, bud, okay?

1022
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:26,197
All right, you got
to take it easy now.

1023
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:27,699
All right.
All right, slow...

1024
00:44:27,733 --> 00:44:29,234
All right,
we're going to... whoa.

1025
00:44:29,267 --> 00:44:30,702
Just... easy!

1026
00:44:30,736 --> 00:44:31,737
(Tires squeal)

1027
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,004
What are you doing?

1028
00:44:33,038 --> 00:44:34,239
I-I'm sorry.

1029
00:44:34,272 --> 00:44:35,473
I know, but what
are you doing?

1030
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,042
I'm sorry, dad.

1031
00:44:37,075 --> 00:44:38,143
- All right, you're sorry.
- Joe, please.

1032
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:39,144
Sorry's not
good enough.

1033
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:40,278
Can we just
go home?

1034
00:44:40,311 --> 00:44:41,312
You got to be
careful.

1035
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:42,814
People can
get hurt here.

1036
00:44:42,848 --> 00:44:44,783
- I know.
- All right.

1037
00:44:44,816 --> 00:44:46,785
- (Tires squeal)
- All right, listen to me.

1038
00:44:46,818 --> 00:44:48,186
What are you doing?

1039
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:49,721
What are you doing?!

1040
00:44:49,755 --> 00:44:50,956
- Stella: Joe. Joseph.
- Huh?!

1041
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:51,990
Dad, you know what?

1042
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:54,926
I don't even
want your car.

1043
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,362
Wait a minute!

1044
00:44:57,395 --> 00:44:58,864
Quitter.

1045
00:44:58,897 --> 00:45:00,165
What?

1046
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,734
You're a quitter
and an ingrate.

1047
00:45:02,768 --> 00:45:04,069
Asshole.

1048
00:45:04,102 --> 00:45:05,771
What'd you
just call me?

1049
00:45:05,804 --> 00:45:08,206
I called you
a fucking asshole.

1050
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,777
(Stella screams)

1051
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:14,145
Joseph!
(Screams)

1052
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,316
Stella:
My God.

1053
00:45:20,786 --> 00:45:22,087
Natalie:
Maddie!

1054
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,521
Maddie. Maddie,
are you okay?

1055
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,824
Stella:
Maddie. Maddie!

1056
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,959
(Sobbing)

1057
00:45:27,993 --> 00:45:30,061
I'm fine.

1058
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:37,903
Stop it.

1059
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:42,874
(Engine roars)

1060
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,301
(Door closes)

1061
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:07,325
(Door opens)

1062
00:47:17,936 --> 00:47:19,938
You need to see
someone.

1063
00:47:22,941 --> 00:47:24,209
I'm not talking
to no headshrinker.

1064
00:47:24,242 --> 00:47:25,911
Are you crazy?

1065
00:47:25,944 --> 00:47:29,614
There are people that
can help you with this.

1066
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:31,416
You know,
just the doctors.

1067
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:34,953
No, no doctors.
What am I going to say
to a doctor? Come on.

1068
00:47:34,986 --> 00:47:37,355
I want to talk
to someone,
I talk to you.

1069
00:47:37,388 --> 00:47:39,124
Talk to me.
Talk to me.

1070
00:47:39,157 --> 00:47:41,292
I talk to you.

1071
00:47:41,326 --> 00:47:43,161
Remember I told you
that I got this scar

1072
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,296
because I fell
and I hit a glass table?

1073
00:47:47,032 --> 00:47:49,200
Well, that was
like half the truth.

1074
00:47:49,234 --> 00:47:52,370
I was 15, Stella,
15 years old.

1075
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:54,605
I was a young man.

1076
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:57,042
I had a toothache,
you know.

1077
00:47:57,075 --> 00:47:58,543
It was really bad.

1078
00:47:58,576 --> 00:48:00,979
I kept telling
my father to take me
to the dentist,

1079
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:03,048
and he said,
"hey, tough it out.
Be a man."

1080
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:05,984
"It's good for you."

1081
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:08,553
So I tried,
you know.

1082
00:48:08,586 --> 00:48:12,223
One night,
I couldn't take
the pain anymore.

1083
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:17,428
So I guess I asked
him too many times
to take me.

1084
00:48:17,462 --> 00:48:19,264
He turned around.
He punched me
in the face,

1085
00:48:19,297 --> 00:48:21,366
knocked me out.

1086
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:23,969
I fell into
the glass table.

1087
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:27,138
40 stitches later,

1088
00:48:27,172 --> 00:48:29,674
I woke up
in the hospital,
you know.

1089
00:48:29,707 --> 00:48:31,943
I felt all right,
you know?

1090
00:48:31,977 --> 00:48:33,444
I got
my tooth fixed.

1091
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,048
That's how I got
this scar, Stella.

1092
00:48:37,082 --> 00:48:38,583
That's the truth.

1093
00:48:38,616 --> 00:48:40,551
It's a beautiful scar.

1094
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:42,553
(Laughs)
Yeah, it's beautiful.

1095
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:44,089
I don't mind it.

1096
00:48:46,224 --> 00:48:48,026
'Cause every time
I look in the mirror,

1097
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:49,961
it makes me
realize how much
I fucking hate him.

1098
00:48:53,064 --> 00:48:54,966
He got
his wish.

1099
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,068
He made me tough,
all right.

1100
00:48:59,404 --> 00:49:02,607
I'm going to make you
an appointment
with Dr. tessler.

1101
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:05,743
Baby, I don't know.

1102
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,478
Yes, he is
a good man.

1103
00:49:07,512 --> 00:49:10,081
You can talk to him.
He can help you, Joseph.

1104
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:11,349
I don't know.

1105
00:49:11,382 --> 00:49:13,484
Please. Please,
I'm begging you.

1106
00:49:13,518 --> 00:49:17,088
Do it for me.
I love you so much.

1107
00:49:17,122 --> 00:49:20,091
Please, Joseph.

1108
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:21,993
Please.

1109
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:25,963
All right.

1110
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:30,068
Thank you.

1111
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:32,670
Natalie:
So we took a trip
to Baton Rouge

1112
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:33,771
to see my dad's
old doctor,

1113
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:37,708
who had semiretired there
three years earlier.

1114
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:41,146
Finally dad was
going to get some help.

1115
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:43,314
This is the moment
we had been praying for.

1116
00:49:43,348 --> 00:49:46,317
Don't we get input
with Dr. tessler?

1117
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:48,353
We thought
we'd get to talk
to him a little.

1118
00:49:48,386 --> 00:49:51,589
I told you I talked
to the doctor.

1119
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:08,639
All right.

1120
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:10,641
Pressure
is normal.

1121
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:12,477
All right.

1122
00:50:14,112 --> 00:50:17,082
So Stella tells me
that you're under
quite a bit of stress.

1123
00:50:17,115 --> 00:50:19,117
She sounded
very concerned.

1124
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:22,120
Yeah, well,
Stella overreacts
about everything, doc.

1125
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:23,554
Oh, to me,

1126
00:50:23,588 --> 00:50:27,125
she sounded like
she was a concerned wife.

1127
00:50:27,158 --> 00:50:28,326
Well...

1128
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:30,728
You know,
there are medications
for this sort of a thing.

1129
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:33,164
No. Doc, I'm not
taking no medication.

1130
00:50:33,198 --> 00:50:35,400
I'm fine.
You know, I mean,

1131
00:50:35,433 --> 00:50:39,404
she's very, like,
anxious, nervous.
You know what I mean.

1132
00:50:39,437 --> 00:50:40,338
- I mean...
- Really?

1133
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:42,140
Yeah. One time,
I had heartburn,
you know.

1134
00:50:42,173 --> 00:50:43,774
She thought
I was having
a heart attack.

1135
00:50:43,808 --> 00:50:45,610
She called 911.

1136
00:50:45,643 --> 00:50:47,378
Really? I didn't know
she was that anxious.

1137
00:50:47,412 --> 00:50:49,847
Ah, that's my wife,
doc.

1138
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,817
So you think
that this...

1139
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:55,186
Fear she has
about your anger

1140
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:58,089
is just
an exaggeration?

1141
00:50:58,123 --> 00:50:59,524
Absolutely.

1142
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:02,660
I mean, look,
am I... I get
angry sometimes?

1143
00:51:02,693 --> 00:51:04,162
Do I got a temper?
Yeah,

1144
00:51:04,195 --> 00:51:05,663
but no different
than any other guy

1145
00:51:05,696 --> 00:51:07,665
who's got,
like, you know,
stress at work.

1146
00:51:07,698 --> 00:51:10,101
I mean,
she overreacts, doc.

1147
00:51:10,135 --> 00:51:12,570
I mean, you know
she was a holocaust
survivor, right?

1148
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:14,105
Yeah, I know that.

1149
00:51:14,139 --> 00:51:15,873
Yeah. Well, this woman
went through a lot.

1150
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,708
I'm telling you.
I mean, she...

1151
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:19,210
You know, Christian
friends of her family,

1152
00:51:19,244 --> 00:51:20,845
they hid her in a hole
in the ground

1153
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:23,114
during the day
for two years.

1154
00:51:23,148 --> 00:51:24,349
That's incredible.

1155
00:51:24,382 --> 00:51:27,118
You're telling me,
doc.

1156
00:51:27,152 --> 00:51:30,121
So do you think this is
what this is all about?

1157
00:51:30,155 --> 00:51:32,223
Oh, absolutely, doc.

1158
00:51:32,257 --> 00:51:34,592
I mean,
you don't understand.
I'm her whole world.

1159
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:37,895
When I met her,
she couldn't even speak
a word of English.

1160
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,631
She had nothing.
I mean, you know,

1161
00:51:40,665 --> 00:51:43,634
I gave her a life that's
like a fairytale land.

1162
00:51:43,668 --> 00:51:45,270
I'm fine,
doc, really.

1163
00:51:45,303 --> 00:51:47,338
Right?
I'm fine, right?
Come on.

1164
00:51:49,674 --> 00:51:51,376
(Both chuckle)

1165
00:51:52,477 --> 00:51:54,279
Dr. tessler:
Stella, girls,

1166
00:51:54,312 --> 00:51:55,880
you'll be happy
to hear that Joe

1167
00:51:55,913 --> 00:51:57,915
is as healthy
as a man half his age,

1168
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,518
fit as a fiddle,
no sign of depression

1169
00:52:00,551 --> 00:52:02,653
or anything else
that concerns me.

1170
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:04,822
That's wonderful.

1171
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:06,791
What'd I tell you?

1172
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:09,394
- Joe: Thanks, doc.
- You're welcome.

1173
00:52:11,229 --> 00:52:12,697
Joe:
You guys ready?

1174
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:15,300
- Natalie: Doctor was wrong.
- Let's go.

1175
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:16,801
Everything was not fine.

1176
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:20,371
My father had so many
plates spinning in the air

1177
00:52:20,405 --> 00:52:23,308
that one of them
was bound to crash.

1178
00:52:23,341 --> 00:52:25,310
It was the law
of gravity.

1179
00:52:25,343 --> 00:52:27,512
Right.
Oh, kimball.

1180
00:52:27,545 --> 00:52:29,814
Kimball,
listen to me,
all right?

1181
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:32,283
Are you telling me
there's not a chance

1182
00:52:32,317 --> 00:52:34,652
that this legislation's
going to pass now?

1183
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:36,521
What?

1184
00:52:36,554 --> 00:52:38,323
With all your
political muscle,

1185
00:52:38,356 --> 00:52:39,824
you can't get
a bill passed

1186
00:52:39,857 --> 00:52:42,393
that's
a fucking win-win
for this country?

1187
00:52:44,362 --> 00:52:46,231
Do they know
how many jobs

1188
00:52:46,264 --> 00:52:47,865
they're flushing
down the toilet here?

1189
00:52:49,767 --> 00:52:51,836
If all
the manufacturing
goes overseas,

1190
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:54,839
we're going to have
nothing left here.

1191
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:57,475
Forget it. Forget it.

1192
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,210
(Handset rings)

1193
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:05,650
Where are you
going?

1194
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:08,619
I got to take care
of something at work.

1195
00:53:08,653 --> 00:53:10,321
Don't wait up for me,
all right?

1196
00:53:15,893 --> 00:53:19,230
Joe:
I don't know
what I'm going to do.

1197
00:53:20,598 --> 00:53:23,301
That legislation was
going to save my ass.

1198
00:53:24,402 --> 00:53:25,703
I'm out of options.

1199
00:53:28,273 --> 00:53:30,341
You think
I want to burn
my factory down?

1200
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:32,743
You know
what we call that?

1201
00:53:32,777 --> 00:53:34,979
No offense... we call it
"Jewish lightning."

1202
00:53:35,012 --> 00:53:38,283
You know, excuse
the expression.

1203
00:53:38,316 --> 00:53:40,751
I got just the guy
for you.

1204
00:53:40,785 --> 00:53:41,986
I just don't want
anybody getting hurt.

1205
00:53:42,019 --> 00:53:43,988
Ah, nobody's
going to get hurt.

1206
00:53:44,021 --> 00:53:46,324
Boy's a pro,
tops in his field.

1207
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:50,261
(Balls clatter)

1208
00:53:51,028 --> 00:53:52,497
Do it.

1209
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,665
(Balls clatter)

1210
00:54:31,569 --> 00:54:33,037
Joe:
Hey, pumpkin.

1211
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,072
I was looking
through my files,

1212
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:38,075
and I found
these photos.

1213
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,311
You have
to see them.

1214
00:54:40,345 --> 00:54:42,913
Dad, I'm working
on my poem.

1215
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:44,415
Oh, come on.
You work too hard.

1216
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:46,451
Take a break, huh?

1217
00:54:46,484 --> 00:54:48,486
No, you have
to see this.
This is your mother,

1218
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:49,720
your mother
when we were dating.

1219
00:54:49,754 --> 00:54:51,422
Will you
look at this?

1220
00:54:51,456 --> 00:54:53,824
Come here.
Look at that.

1221
00:54:55,393 --> 00:54:57,495
Come here.

1222
00:54:57,528 --> 00:54:58,996
Sit down.

1223
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:00,765
That's your mom.

1224
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:03,934
Whoa. She looks
amazing.

1225
00:55:03,968 --> 00:55:05,670
Yeah, she does.

1226
00:55:05,703 --> 00:55:07,104
Most beautiful
woman I ever met.

1227
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,807
That's all right, huh?
Look at her.

1228
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,509
Look at this one.

1229
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:14,078
That's your
grandmother,
my mom.

1230
00:55:14,111 --> 00:55:15,813
You look
a little like her.

1231
00:55:17,515 --> 00:55:19,484
Do you have
any pictures of grandpa?

1232
00:55:19,517 --> 00:55:21,085
No. No, I had some.

1233
00:55:21,118 --> 00:55:22,787
I don't know
what happened to 'em.

1234
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,389
Hey, you know what?
I forgot

1235
00:55:24,422 --> 00:55:26,090
why I came in here
in the first place.

1236
00:55:26,123 --> 00:55:27,858
Here. Now I want you
to take this,

1237
00:55:27,892 --> 00:55:30,495
and I want you to put it
in a safe place,
all right?

1238
00:55:30,528 --> 00:55:32,597
What is it?

1239
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:34,899
It's information.

1240
00:55:34,932 --> 00:55:37,402
What kind
of information?

1241
00:55:37,435 --> 00:55:39,404
Well, you know,
if something ever
happens to me,

1242
00:55:39,437 --> 00:55:42,039
you know,
you and your sister got
to take care of your mom.

1243
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:43,808
You're both old enough now
to understand.

1244
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:47,678
There's, like,
vault combinations,
insurance policies,

1245
00:55:47,712 --> 00:55:49,380
where the money is.

1246
00:55:49,414 --> 00:55:52,149
Listen. Hey,
things happen
in life, okay?

1247
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,385
Just put it
in a safe spot,
all right?

1248
00:55:58,456 --> 00:56:00,024
This is too weird.

1249
00:56:00,057 --> 00:56:01,559
(Laughs)

1250
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,897
I'll put it in here.

1251
00:56:12,437 --> 00:56:13,904
Let me
tell you something,

1252
00:56:13,938 --> 00:56:16,441
and I'm
not telling you this
because I'm your father.

1253
00:56:16,474 --> 00:56:17,975
You are remarkable.

1254
00:56:20,911 --> 00:56:23,581
(Laughs)
Thanks, daddy.

1255
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:28,653
You know,
I think this is
the first time

1256
00:56:28,686 --> 00:56:30,154
that we've
ever talked
like this,

1257
00:56:30,187 --> 00:56:32,490
me and you.

1258
00:56:32,523 --> 00:56:34,659
You're kidding.

1259
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,662
Come here.

1260
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:52,743
Man:
Hello?

1261
00:56:52,777 --> 00:56:54,845
Lenny. Yeah, hi.
It's Joe.

1262
00:56:54,879 --> 00:56:56,747
Joe, it's been
on my mind...

1263
00:56:56,781 --> 00:56:59,750
Yeah. I know.
Hey, listen, we both
got crazy, right?

1264
00:56:59,784 --> 00:57:01,486
It's all right.
Forget it.

1265
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:04,489
Look, I was wondering
if you could still
do me a favor.

1266
00:57:04,522 --> 00:57:06,724
What do you
need, Joe?

1267
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:09,727
Yeah, well,
could you call shuster?

1268
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,696
And if it's
still available,

1269
00:57:11,729 --> 00:57:13,931
I'd like to take
his offer.

1270
00:57:13,964 --> 00:57:16,867
Tell him we
can make a deal here,
all right?

1271
00:57:16,901 --> 00:57:18,569
Well, sure.
Absolutely.
Joey, look...

1272
00:57:18,603 --> 00:57:20,204
Forget it. Come on.
We both got nuts. It's...

1273
00:57:20,237 --> 00:57:21,071
Come on. 30 years
we're together.

1274
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:23,474
What are we going to do,
throw it away?

1275
00:57:23,508 --> 00:57:26,577
- Ah, never us, Joe.
- All right. All right, thanks.

1276
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:36,654
Radio:
* hey, hey

1277
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:37,888
* all right

1278
00:57:37,922 --> 00:57:40,224
* get it

1279
00:57:40,257 --> 00:57:42,693
* all right

1280
00:57:42,727 --> 00:57:45,863
* I said
a-find it, find it *

1281
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:47,665
* darling, love it

1282
00:57:47,698 --> 00:57:49,700
* if you like it

1283
00:57:49,734 --> 00:57:51,636
* yeah

1284
00:57:51,669 --> 00:57:54,739
* hey, hey

1285
00:57:54,772 --> 00:57:56,240
* it's your business...

1286
00:57:56,273 --> 00:57:58,275
Come on, man. Let's get
this party started, huh?

1287
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,644
Whoo!

1288
00:57:59,677 --> 00:58:01,512
* get it together, baby

1289
00:58:01,546 --> 00:58:03,147
- * come and get your love...
- Whoo!

1290
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,516
- (Laughter)
- Whoo!

1291
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:07,852
- Yeah!
- Oh, my God.

1292
00:58:07,885 --> 00:58:10,755
Boy:
Louie! Louie!

1293
00:58:10,788 --> 00:58:13,257
- * come and get your love...
- Louie!

1294
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:15,225
Maddie:
Who invited them?

1295
00:58:15,259 --> 00:58:17,294
* come and get
your love... *

1296
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:20,064
excuse me.
(Laughs)

1297
00:58:20,097 --> 00:58:21,231
- (Whistling)
- Whoo-hoo!

1298
00:58:21,265 --> 00:58:22,767
Girl:
Go, guys.

1299
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,702
(Laughter, whistling)

1300
00:58:26,604 --> 00:58:28,639
Get out of my pool!

1301
00:58:28,673 --> 00:58:30,174
Come on.
We're just having fun.

1302
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:31,275
Get out of my pool.

1303
00:58:31,308 --> 00:58:33,778
- Welcome to the party.
- Get out of my pool now!

1304
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:35,079
Get out!

1305
00:58:35,112 --> 00:58:38,182
(Car approaches)

1306
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:40,217
(Car door closes)

1307
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,319
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey.

1308
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:45,122
Ah, I thought you were
working late.

1309
00:58:45,155 --> 00:58:46,824
You all right?

1310
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:48,926
Yeah, no, I had
one of those days,
you know?

1311
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:50,561
I just wanted
to come home to see

1312
00:58:50,595 --> 00:58:52,062
you and the kids,
you know?

1313
00:58:52,096 --> 00:58:53,564
Where are
the girls?

1314
00:58:53,598 --> 00:58:55,065
They're in back
at the pool.

1315
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:56,567
Maddie's got
some friends over.

1316
00:58:56,601 --> 00:58:58,068
- Really?
- Yeah.

1317
00:58:58,102 --> 00:58:59,103
How many friends?

1318
00:58:59,136 --> 00:59:00,605
Ah, just a few
nice kids.

1319
00:59:00,638 --> 00:59:03,774
- Mom!
- What's going on?

1320
00:59:03,808 --> 00:59:06,043
Oh, they're just
having fun.

1321
00:59:06,076 --> 00:59:09,279
Yeah. Except,
I think,

1322
00:59:09,313 --> 00:59:12,282
maybe one of them
forgot their bathing suit.

1323
00:59:12,316 --> 00:59:14,652
Somebody's
in my pool with
no clothes on?

1324
00:59:15,352 --> 00:59:16,721
Um...

1325
00:59:16,754 --> 00:59:18,055
Just wait there.
Just don't...

1326
00:59:18,088 --> 00:59:19,990
- Son of a bitch.
- Joe, they're just kids.

1327
00:59:20,024 --> 00:59:22,627
- Kids got no respect.
- Joseph, listen.

1328
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,762
- Natalie: Mom?
- What are you doing?

1329
00:59:24,795 --> 00:59:26,263
- Never mind.
- What is it?

1330
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:27,765
No, what are you
do...

1331
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:29,266
- Oh, my God. No, Joe.
- Dad!

1332
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:30,835
Listen, I'm only
going to scare them.

1333
00:59:30,868 --> 00:59:33,037
Just relax.
Everybody relax.

1334
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,939
He's not going
to shoot them,
is he?

1335
00:59:34,972 --> 00:59:36,974
- Just relax, okay!
- Mom?

1336
00:59:37,007 --> 00:59:39,076
Oh, my God.
No.

1337
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:41,278
* baby, hey, oh

1338
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:42,947
* hey, all right

1339
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:44,381
* get it
from the main vine... *

1340
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:47,652
all right! I'm going
to say this once
and only once!

1341
00:59:47,685 --> 00:59:49,987
Jesus Christ.
Your dad's fricking crazy!

1342
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,622
I want you to pick up
your things,

1343
00:59:51,656 --> 00:59:53,023
put on your clothes,

1344
00:59:53,057 --> 00:59:55,292
and get off
my property now,

1345
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:57,662
or I'm going
to start shooting!

1346
00:59:57,695 --> 00:59:59,930
- Daddy!
- One!

1347
00:59:59,964 --> 01:00:02,132
- Two!
- Jesus Christ.

1348
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:04,101
- Three!
- He's not gonna shoot anybody.

1349
01:00:04,134 --> 01:00:05,703
- Four!
- Get out of here, Louie!

1350
01:00:05,736 --> 01:00:06,771
- Five!
- Leave!

1351
01:00:06,804 --> 01:00:07,972
- Oh, shit.
- Six!

1352
01:00:08,005 --> 01:00:09,206
- Get out of here, Louie!
- Leave!

1353
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:11,141
- Seven!
- Just go!

1354
01:00:11,175 --> 01:00:12,643
- Eight!
- Get out!

1355
01:00:12,677 --> 01:00:13,811
- Nine!
- Earl: Holy jeez.

1356
01:00:13,844 --> 01:00:15,846
- You crazy kike!
- Get out!

1357
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:16,847
- 10!
- Louie!

1358
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:18,649
Earl:
Get out of here!

1359
01:00:18,683 --> 01:00:19,684
(Kids screaming)

1360
01:00:19,717 --> 01:00:20,584
- Move!
- (Gunshot)

1361
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:23,020
- He has a gun, maddie.
- Just go, please.

1362
01:00:23,053 --> 01:00:25,756
That's right!
Run!

1363
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:28,358
Run, you son
of a bitches!

1364
01:00:28,392 --> 01:00:29,794
- Dad!
- Maddie.

1365
01:00:31,996 --> 01:00:33,731
Boy:
I can't believe that.

1366
01:00:33,764 --> 01:00:36,133
Shoot me!

1367
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:39,670
Shoot me.
You've ruined
my life!

1368
01:00:39,704 --> 01:00:41,772
You might as well
shoot me!

1369
01:00:41,806 --> 01:00:44,141
What the hell are
you talking about?

1370
01:00:44,174 --> 01:00:46,443
You threatened
all of my new friends

1371
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,212
with a gun, dad!

1372
01:00:52,182 --> 01:00:54,451
You're sick.
(Sobs)

1373
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,787
You need help, dad.

1374
01:01:00,858 --> 01:01:03,360
(Maddie sobbing)

1375
01:01:12,837 --> 01:01:15,372
They just said
there's going to be
a storm tonight.

1376
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:17,374
Isn't it
hurricane season?

1377
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:20,945
Maybe you should just
hold off on all this
till tomorrow.

1378
01:01:20,978 --> 01:01:22,179
(Car radio
playing rock music)

1379
01:01:22,212 --> 01:01:24,114
* the sound
of your footsteps... *

1380
01:01:24,148 --> 01:01:27,351
it's too late for that.
He's here.

1381
01:01:27,384 --> 01:01:28,953
Come with me.

1382
01:01:28,986 --> 01:01:30,955
* your soft,
gentle motion, baby... *

1383
01:01:30,988 --> 01:01:33,958
- come with me.
- I can't.

1384
01:01:35,492 --> 01:01:39,730
* in my midnight
confession *

1385
01:01:39,764 --> 01:01:43,233
* when I tell all the world
that I love you *

1386
01:01:43,267 --> 01:01:46,170
* in my midnight
confession *

1387
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:52,076
* when I say all the things
that I want to... *

1388
01:01:52,109 --> 01:01:53,844
- hey.
- Hi.

1389
01:01:53,878 --> 01:01:55,946
Natalie:
Maddie had somewhere to go.

1390
01:01:57,514 --> 01:01:59,216
She was smarter
than I thought.

1391
01:02:01,151 --> 01:02:04,121
In fact, she was
a lot smarter than me,

1392
01:02:04,154 --> 01:02:05,890
'cause I didn't have
an escape plan.

1393
01:02:05,923 --> 01:02:07,892
I was stuck.

1394
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:18,903
(Line rings)

1395
01:02:18,936 --> 01:02:20,805
- Yeah?
- Bobby.

1396
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:22,372
- Yeah, it's Joe fine.
- Hey, Joe.

1397
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:24,408
Yeah, no.
I'm good. I'm good.
How you doing? Yeah.

1398
01:02:24,441 --> 01:02:26,376
Listen, that thing
we talked about...

1399
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:28,212
You know,
about hiring that kid?

1400
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:29,814
- Jewish lightning.
- Yeah, right. Yeah.

1401
01:02:29,847 --> 01:02:31,315
Yeah,
the Jewish lightning.

1402
01:02:31,348 --> 01:02:32,850
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah. Forget it.

1403
01:02:32,883 --> 01:02:34,551
Cancel the whole thing.

1404
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,386
What?
No, let's just say

1405
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,923
I had a moment of clarity,
all right? Yeah.

1406
01:02:38,956 --> 01:02:40,891
Yeah, well,
on my end,
battelli...

1407
01:02:40,925 --> 01:02:42,893
What about battelli?

1408
01:02:42,927 --> 01:02:45,362
Listen, you tell him
I'm a man of my word.

1409
01:02:45,395 --> 01:02:47,898
All right,
he's going to get paid.

1410
01:02:47,932 --> 01:02:49,800
Bobby, you think
that scares me?

1411
01:02:49,834 --> 01:02:51,401
You have no idea
right now.

1412
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:53,537
You think that
scares me, Bobby? Huh?

1413
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:55,572
You tell him to do
what he's got to do.

1414
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:58,108
I'll put him
in my goddamn will,
all right?!

1415
01:02:58,142 --> 01:03:01,946
(Handset slams)

1416
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,596
I was thinking
maybe this weekend

1417
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:22,332
we could picnic
over by the lake

1418
01:03:22,366 --> 01:03:24,101
or, you know,
out by...

1419
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:25,302
Sounds fun.

1420
01:03:25,335 --> 01:03:28,172
Hey, man.
What the hell
you doing?

1421
01:03:28,205 --> 01:03:29,573
Sorry, bro.
This your car?

1422
01:03:29,606 --> 01:03:31,608
Yes. What the hell
you doing sitting on it?

1423
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,477
Hey, look,
I wasn't sitting.
I was leaning.

1424
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:35,412
You was leaning?
Don't get smart
with me, boy.

1425
01:03:35,445 --> 01:03:37,547
- I don't want no trouble.
- He didn't do anything.

1426
01:03:37,581 --> 01:03:38,582
He was thinking
about stealing it,

1427
01:03:38,615 --> 01:03:39,950
wasn't you,
you fucking nigger?

1428
01:03:39,984 --> 01:03:41,485
Stop it!
He didn't do
anything.

1429
01:03:41,518 --> 01:03:42,953
- Maddie!
- Stop!

1430
01:03:42,987 --> 01:03:44,454
Maddie, look,
down here,

1431
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:46,190
women don't tell men
what to do, okay?

1432
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,327
Maddie. Maddie!

1433
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,862
Maddie,
where are you going?

1434
01:03:51,896 --> 01:03:53,163
Don't touch me.

1435
01:03:53,197 --> 01:03:54,865
Where are you
going?!

1436
01:04:12,282 --> 01:04:14,418
I want to help you.

1437
01:04:17,254 --> 01:04:19,523
But I'm scared
of you.

1438
01:04:19,556 --> 01:04:21,858
(Laughs)

1439
01:04:24,294 --> 01:04:26,030
You're not
scared of me.

1440
01:04:26,063 --> 01:04:27,464
You love me.

1441
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:28,966
Come on, Stella.

1442
01:04:28,999 --> 01:04:30,467
- Come here.
- No more. No.

1443
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,902
Natalie:
What's going on?

1444
01:04:31,936 --> 01:04:33,403
Just let me talk
to your father.

1445
01:04:33,437 --> 01:04:35,940
Tell her to go away,
all right?

1446
01:04:35,973 --> 01:04:38,042
Just tell her...
Let's go upstairs.

1447
01:04:38,075 --> 01:04:40,577
Let's go upstairs,
baby. Come on.

1448
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,146
I want to go
upstairs.

1449
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,284
Just listen to me.
Listen.

1450
01:04:47,317 --> 01:04:49,286
Now you go over there,
and you tell them

1451
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:50,921
to get the fuck
upstairs. You hear me?

1452
01:04:50,955 --> 01:04:52,556
- Get 'em out of here.
- Don't you see

1453
01:04:52,589 --> 01:04:53,690
what you're doing
to your children?

1454
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,926
Tell them to get
the fuck out of here!

1455
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,928
Don't you
touch her!

1456
01:04:57,962 --> 01:04:59,596
(Thunder rumbling)

1457
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:02,599
Do you know
what's going on here?

1458
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:04,969
Everything's
turning to shit!

1459
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:13,643
When are you going
to get it through
your thick skulls

1460
01:05:13,677 --> 01:05:15,946
that I hate
my fucking life?

1461
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:03,060
(Insects chirping)

1462
01:06:03,093 --> 01:06:04,594
(Gunshot pops)

1463
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:06,030
- (Women screaming)
- Daddy!

1464
01:06:06,063 --> 01:06:08,232
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

1465
01:06:08,265 --> 01:06:10,134
- Daddy!
- Dad!

1466
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:14,638
(Sobbing)

1467
01:06:31,055 --> 01:06:33,757
(Dog barking)

1468
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:45,569
Are you okay?

1469
01:06:47,571 --> 01:06:49,039
I hate you.

1470
01:06:49,073 --> 01:06:52,176
Why don't you
try to stop him?

1471
01:06:52,209 --> 01:06:56,046
Does someone
in this family

1472
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,647
(sobbing)
Have to kill themselves

1473
01:06:57,681 --> 01:07:01,351
before you can
finally see what's
been going on here?

1474
01:07:01,385 --> 01:07:06,256
Because the truth is,
I've thought about it,
mama.

1475
01:07:23,607 --> 01:07:25,642
(Alarm, sirens blaring)

1476
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:41,258
What's going on?

1477
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:42,759
Who turned on
the alarm?

1478
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:44,261
I did.

1479
01:07:44,294 --> 01:07:47,164
- By accident?
- No, not an accident.

1480
01:07:47,197 --> 01:07:49,199
We're in trouble.

1481
01:07:49,233 --> 01:07:50,734
What the hell
are you talking about?

1482
01:07:50,767 --> 01:07:51,935
- What's happening?
- What's going on?

1483
01:07:51,968 --> 01:07:54,204
What the hell
is the matter
with you, Stella?

1484
01:07:54,238 --> 01:07:56,840
You call the cops
right now, and you tell
them it was a mistake.

1485
01:07:56,873 --> 01:07:58,142
No, it's not
a mistake.

1486
01:07:58,175 --> 01:08:00,777
Everybody, get upstairs.
It's fine, okay?

1487
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,479
It's okay.

1488
01:08:02,512 --> 01:08:04,114
(Police siren wailing)

1489
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:09,253
(Radio dispatch
chatter)

1490
01:08:09,286 --> 01:08:11,155
What the hell
is wrong with you?

1491
01:08:11,188 --> 01:08:13,357
(Police
bang on door)

1492
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:17,594
Please, come in.

1493
01:08:17,627 --> 01:08:19,163
He's terrorizing us.

1494
01:08:19,196 --> 01:08:20,597
It's my husband.
He's got a gun.

1495
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:22,132
- He tried to kill himself.
- Sir. Sir.

1496
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:23,300
- No, no, no.
- Calm down.

1497
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:24,634
- It was a mistake.
- Calm down, sir.

1498
01:08:24,668 --> 01:08:25,902
- Officer, no, no.
- Just calm down.

1499
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,272
It was a mistake.
Are you listening
to what I'm saying?

1500
01:08:28,305 --> 01:08:29,506
- Calm down.
- It was a mistake.

1501
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:31,308
- What are you doing?
- Natalie: No.

1502
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:33,210
Don't cuff me,
not in front of my kids.

1503
01:08:33,243 --> 01:08:35,879
Stella, would you
tell them this
is my house?

1504
01:08:35,912 --> 01:08:37,381
Stella, tell 'em!

1505
01:08:37,414 --> 01:08:39,616
No, Joe.
It's my house.

1506
01:08:40,884 --> 01:08:42,686
(Siren continues)

1507
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:45,155
- (Sobbing)
- It's okay.

1508
01:08:45,189 --> 01:08:46,723
Okay.

1509
01:08:52,362 --> 01:08:55,232
(Siren, alarm fade)

1510
01:09:21,691 --> 01:09:24,194
Natalie:
My mother never spoke to us

1511
01:09:24,228 --> 01:09:25,529
about what she had done.

1512
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:32,836
But incredibly,

1513
01:09:32,869 --> 01:09:34,771
she had done it.

1514
01:09:38,308 --> 01:09:39,876
And our home was quiet.

1515
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,951
It was more than quiet.
It was peaceful.

1516
01:10:03,667 --> 01:10:05,669
Look what came
in the mail today.

1517
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:08,805
It's the poetry
contest people.

1518
01:10:08,838 --> 01:10:12,242
What? How is that
even possible?

1519
01:10:12,276 --> 01:10:13,643
I was disqualified.

1520
01:10:13,677 --> 01:10:15,612
You open it.

1521
01:10:23,019 --> 01:10:24,588
Oh, my God.

1522
01:10:24,621 --> 01:10:26,556
You're a finalist.

1523
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:28,258
What? Really?
I am?

1524
01:10:28,292 --> 01:10:29,559
(Laughs)

1525
01:10:29,593 --> 01:10:31,027
This is
unbelievable.

1526
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,829
I'm so proud
of you.

1527
01:10:44,608 --> 01:10:46,876
Natalie:
We were finally ready
to slow down...

1528
01:10:48,345 --> 01:10:50,414
stop running.

1529
01:10:52,316 --> 01:10:54,951
This is
so exciting.

1530
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:56,886
I'm betting
on Natalie to win.

1531
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,389
But you'll
still love me
even if I place?

1532
01:10:59,423 --> 01:11:01,625
Oh, even if you
show and throw up
on the judge...

1533
01:11:01,658 --> 01:11:04,361
Judge:
It gives me great pleasure

1534
01:11:04,394 --> 01:11:07,364
to announce
the first-place winner

1535
01:11:07,397 --> 01:11:10,367
of the sixth annual
Louisiana state.

1536
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:14,404
Campbell's soup
poetry competition,

1537
01:11:14,438 --> 01:11:17,941
Natalie Elizabeth fine.

1538
01:11:17,974 --> 01:11:19,743
(Applause, cheering)

1539
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:21,277
You can do it.

1540
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:35,024
Congratulations,
Natalie.

1541
01:11:35,058 --> 01:11:38,362
Here's the $500
prize money.

1542
01:11:42,666 --> 01:11:45,935
Natalie, would you
do us the honor

1543
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:48,772
of reading your poem,
"mighty fine"?

1544
01:11:52,376 --> 01:11:53,677
Go ahead.

1545
01:12:15,765 --> 01:12:18,368
"Little boy's devil..."

1546
01:12:19,769 --> 01:12:21,538
now devil's man.

1547
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:27,444
Still running
from where he ran.

1548
01:12:27,477 --> 01:12:30,380
Still hiding
when he can.

1549
01:12:32,482 --> 01:12:35,051
Though my parents once said

1550
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:38,121
that the monster
was dead,

1551
01:12:38,154 --> 01:12:42,025
there's been
a recent resurrection.

1552
01:12:42,058 --> 01:12:45,595
A blister on sanity's
bright complexion.

1553
01:12:48,131 --> 01:12:51,735
A tug of war
with imperfection

1554
01:12:51,768 --> 01:12:54,738
in this temple
of emotion,

1555
01:12:54,771 --> 01:12:57,874
where he stirred
so much commotion.

1556
01:13:01,144 --> 01:13:03,880
There's a monster
in dad,

1557
01:13:03,913 --> 01:13:06,483
and it makes him
wicked mad.

1558
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:19,395
Is there a cure
in dad's devotion...

1559
01:13:20,864 --> 01:13:23,433
or in a child's
whispered pleas?

1560
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:28,071
Tame the monster
in dad,

1561
01:13:28,104 --> 01:13:31,641
take his fits,
all that's bad...

1562
01:13:33,209 --> 01:13:38,515
"and save
one mighty fine family."

1563
01:13:41,985 --> 01:13:44,488
(Applause)

1564
01:13:50,794 --> 01:13:52,896
Natalie:
That's the way
I wish it had been.

1565
01:13:54,664 --> 01:13:57,767
My dad never made it
to the contest,

1566
01:13:57,801 --> 01:14:01,705
but he finally
got some help.

1567
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:06,843
And his hospital stay
saved all of our lives.

1568
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:10,814
As his anger faded,

1569
01:14:10,847 --> 01:14:13,016
my courage grew,

1570
01:14:13,049 --> 01:14:16,052
and we met up
somewhere in the middle.

1571
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:23,593
Okay, so I wasn't
Anne Frank.

1572
01:14:25,729 --> 01:14:28,698
But I was me,

1573
01:14:28,732 --> 01:14:31,701
and that was enough.

1574
01:14:31,735 --> 01:14:34,671
Eventually we found
each other again...

1575
01:14:38,041 --> 01:14:40,176
and that was enough.

1576
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,922
(Cajun music playing)

1577
01:15:01,097 --> 01:15:03,700
* goodbye, Joe,

1578
01:15:03,733 --> 01:15:05,835
* me, oh, my, oh

1579

1604

(Rock music playing)

1605
01:16:54,077 --> 01:16:56,312
* just one glance

1606
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:58,982

1607
01:16:59,015 --> 01:17:01,284
