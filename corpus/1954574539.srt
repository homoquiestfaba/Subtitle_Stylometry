1
00:00:20,285 --> 00:00:23,487
<i>This is a story that begins
on a warm spring night...</i>

2
00:00:23,488 --> 00:00:26,211
<i>at a meeting of the 20th
Century Motors employees.</i>

3
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:30,997
<i>It was a night
I'll never forget.</i>

4
00:00:32,597 --> 00:00:35,800
<i>When the owner of the company
died, his children took over...</i>

5
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:39,069
<i>and brought in a new plan
to run the factory.</i>

6
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,474
<i>The plan was that everybody would
work as hard as they could,</i>

7
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:47,778
<i>but share in their salaries
and the profit based on need...</i>

8
00:00:47,779 --> 00:00:50,648
<i>That is, those who claimed
they needed the money most...</i>

9
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:52,594
<i>were the ones
who got paid the most.</i>

10
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:01,492
This is a crucial moment
in the history of this company.

11
00:01:01,493 --> 00:01:05,662
Now remember, each of us
now belongs to the other...

12
00:01:05,663 --> 00:01:08,497
by the moral law we all voted
for and we all accept.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,040
I don't.

14
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,676
I don't accept it.

15
00:01:17,676 --> 00:01:20,511
<i>His words caused confusion,</i>

16
00:01:20,512 --> 00:01:24,948
<i>but he stood there like a man
who knew he was right.</i>

17
00:01:24,949 --> 00:01:29,724
And I'm going to put a stop
to this once and for all.

18
00:01:32,724 --> 00:01:34,663
How?

19
00:01:37,663 --> 00:01:39,799
I'll stop
the motor of the world.

20
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,267
Who is that guy?

21
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:48,375
<i>And with those words,
he was gone.</i>

22
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:53,845
<i>In the 12 years that followed, lights
went out in the great factories...</i>

23
00:01:54,045 --> 00:01:58,348
<i>which had stood as solid
as oak trees for generations.</i>

24
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:03,987
<i>Their gates closed as if some silent power
had turned them into lifeless shells.</i>

25
00:02:03,988 --> 00:02:07,000
<i>The world was quietly crumbling
with no end in sight.</i>

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,234
<i>The high seas
weren't safe anymore.</i>

27
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:20,402
<i>Cargo no longer reached
its destination.</i>

28
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,079
<i>Shortages grounded airlines and it
was too expensive for most to drive.</i>

29
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,020
<i>Regulations strangled the production
of coal, gas, oil and nuclear power.</i>

30
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:39,323
<i>Power outages were frequent because
no copper was available...</i>

31
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:41,859
<i>to maintain
the transmission lines.</i>

32
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,362
<i>Taggart Transcontinental, the
largest railroad in the country,</i>

33
00:02:45,363 --> 00:02:47,641
<i>was one of the few things
still operating.</i>

34
00:02:50,502 --> 00:02:54,204
<i>We began to wonder, we began to
talk about what he'd said...</i>

35
00:02:54,205 --> 00:02:56,639
<i>and thought maybe
he'd kept his word...</i>

36
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,418
<i>That perhaps he had stopped
the motor of the world.</i>

37
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,382
<i>Some even tried to look for him, but
he had vanished without a trace,</i>

38
00:03:06,383 --> 00:03:08,257
<i>and so had
a lot of other people.</i>

39
00:03:12,257 --> 00:03:16,173
<i>We wondered what sort of impossible
power he had to keep his promise.</i>

40
00:03:28,173 --> 00:03:33,553
<i>All the best and the brightest seemed
to be disappearing without explanation.</i>

41
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:43,787
<i>Perhaps people kept asking
the question...</i>

42
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:47,592
<i>because they knew something had
gone missing from the world.</i>

43
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:52,839
<i>Perhaps this is why
we began to say it.</i>

44
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,741
<i>We couldn't help but think
of the young lab engineer...</i>

45
00:04:04,742 --> 00:04:07,311
<i>who said he would stop
the motor of the world.</i>

46
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:08,646
<i>You see, his name was...</i>

47
00:04:09,014 --> 00:04:10,514
- Who is John Galt?
-<i> John Galt.</i>

48
00:04:58,428 --> 00:05:00,330
Don't... Don't move.

49
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:01,776
Miss Taggart, you're hurt.

50
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:06,502
- You know me.
- For many years.

51
00:05:06,637 --> 00:05:10,238
- Do I know you?
- I think you do.

52
00:05:11,142 --> 00:05:14,947
- What is your name?
- John Galt.

53
00:05:16,947 --> 00:05:19,282
Your name is John Galt?

54
00:05:19,283 --> 00:05:21,552
Why does that frighten you?

55
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:23,322
Because I believe you.

56
00:05:25,322 --> 00:05:26,890
Was it you I was following?

57
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:28,531
Yes.

58
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,734
Where's your plane?

59
00:05:37,735 --> 00:05:40,339
It's...
It's on the landing strip.

60
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:42,873
Landing strip?

61
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:45,508
On the other side of the valley.

62
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:47,109
There was no...
There was nothing.

63
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,645
Look. Closely.

64
00:05:48,646 --> 00:05:51,220
You see that refracted image?

65
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,904
It's to keep out the uninvited.

66
00:06:13,794 --> 00:06:16,239
I'll call Doc Hendricks.
See what you can do.

67
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,240
Right.

68
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:25,223
Hey, Doc.
Yeah, it's the plane.

69
00:06:33,223 --> 00:06:36,126
Dagny. Are you all right?

70
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:37,794
Is that Dr. Akston?

71
00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:39,830
Well, thank goodness for that.

72
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:41,931
I saved what I could
from the wreck.

73
00:06:41,932 --> 00:06:44,701
The last time I saw you, I told
you you would never find him...

74
00:06:44,702 --> 00:06:47,536
- and now here you are in his arms.
- In whose arms?

75
00:06:48,005 --> 00:06:50,950
The man you were looking for...
My philosophy student.

76
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,312
The man who invented the motor.

77
00:06:55,312 --> 00:06:57,119
You invented the motor?

78
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,790
You're lucky
you didn't break your neck.

79
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,391
- Is she all right?
- Appears to be.

80
00:07:08,392 --> 00:07:10,059
Well, we didn't plan for this.

81
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:13,634
She'll be my responsibility.

82
00:07:16,634 --> 00:07:18,669
Where are we?

83
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,237
Mulligan's Valley.

84
00:07:20,238 --> 00:07:22,408
Midas!

85
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:26,408
- That was quite a stunt, Dagny.
- What are you doing here?

86
00:07:26,444 --> 00:07:28,445
I saw your plane.

87
00:07:28,446 --> 00:07:30,147
I never imagined
it was being piloted...

88
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:33,951
by one of only two people
still missing from this valley.

89
00:07:33,952 --> 00:07:35,419
Who's the other?

90
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,021
Hank Rearden, of course.

91
00:07:40,591 --> 00:07:42,762
Glad you're in one piece.

92
00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:47,364
Doc Hendricks will meet you.

93
00:07:47,365 --> 00:07:49,698
If she's up for it, bring
her by my house tonight.

94
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:51,923
I'll arrange something.

95
00:08:45,923 --> 00:08:48,923
- Your house?
- Mine, yeah.

96
00:08:50,394 --> 00:08:52,032
All right.
Nice and easy.

97
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:56,298
Hi, Dagny.

98
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:58,835
I am Dr. Thomas Hendricks.

99
00:08:58,836 --> 00:09:01,454
- May I have a look at your injuries?
- The neurosurgeon?

100
00:09:01,455 --> 00:09:05,578
Yes. But here in the valley, I
practice other medicine as well.

101
00:09:08,578 --> 00:09:12,449
Okay. This will only take
a second.

102
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:17,120
It's a diagnostic device I
developed here in Atlantis.

103
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:20,990
Every doctor should have one.

104
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:23,991
It's amazing what can be
accomplished without red tape.

105
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:33,704
Okay. Good news.
Nothing serious.

106
00:09:33,705 --> 00:09:36,239
Sprained ankle,
some bruised ribs.

107
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,374
No sign of a concussion.

108
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:43,714
So, I would like you to stay off your
feet for a few days and get some rest.

109
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:45,815
Call me if you have
any questions.

110
00:09:45,816 --> 00:09:48,185
- Thank you, Doctor.
- You're welcome.

111
00:09:48,186 --> 00:09:49,786
Send me the bill.

112
00:09:49,787 --> 00:09:52,690
Absolutely not. No, I...
I will pay for this myself.

113
00:09:54,357 --> 00:10:00,065
- We'll discuss that later.
- Our first trespasser.

114
00:10:01,065 --> 00:10:03,403
- Thank you, Doctor.
- All right.

115
00:10:06,403 --> 00:10:08,772
So you invented the motor?

116
00:10:08,773 --> 00:10:10,482
Let's get you to your room.

117
00:10:19,482 --> 00:10:21,482
- I can walk.
- I know.

118
00:10:25,055 --> 00:10:26,159
Here we are.

119
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,000
- Am I a guest or a prisoner?
- Well, that choice is yours.

120
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,569
How can I make that choice when
I'm dealing with a stranger?

121
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,135
But you're not.

122
00:10:40,136 --> 00:10:42,272
Didn't you name the John
Galt line after me?

123
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:45,374
Yes, I did. But I named it
after my enemy.

124
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,845
Well, that's the contradiction you're
going to have to figure out...

125
00:10:47,846 --> 00:10:50,547
sooner or later.

126
00:10:50,548 --> 00:10:52,715
It was you, wasn't it?

127
00:10:52,716 --> 00:10:54,685
You destroyed my line.

128
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:57,806
- You're the destroyer.
- Get some rest.

129
00:10:58,056 --> 00:10:59,623
Midas invited us to dinner.

130
00:10:59,624 --> 00:11:03,013
There will be some people there
looking forward to seeing you.

131
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:06,037
Why should I trust you?

132
00:11:13,037 --> 00:11:15,739
<i>The world crisis was worsening.</i>

133
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,109
<i>And as the head of state announced
that he would address the nation,</i>

134
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,811
<i>word was spreading quickly
that another giant of industry,</i>

135
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:24,214
<i>Dagny Taggart, had gone missing.</i>

136
00:11:24,215 --> 00:11:27,151
<i>Meanwhile, the government
again increased its reward...</i>

137
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:30,941
<i>for the capture of pirate
Ragnar Danneskold.</i>

138
00:11:52,643 --> 00:11:57,114
Dagny. For a woman that just fell out
of the sky, you look pretty damn good.

139
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:58,401
Thank you, Midas.

140
00:11:58,402 --> 00:12:01,394
And you... you look just the same.
Come on in.

141
00:12:10,394 --> 00:12:13,931
Ladies and gentlemen,
Taggart Transcontinental.

142
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:19,740
Hear, hear!

143
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,709
Dagny, it's wonderful
to have you here.

144
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,844
Enjoy the evening.

145
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:29,512
Thank you, Rebecca.

146
00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:31,849
Everyone here has a story.

147
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,850
- Is that Kay Ludlow?
- Straight from Hollywood.

148
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:38,488
How did you get here, Midas?

149
00:12:38,489 --> 00:12:43,359
Me? I made my fortune lending people money
to buy houses and build businesses,

150
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,229
and I only loaned to those people
I was confident could repay me.

151
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,230
Sure.

152
00:12:47,232 --> 00:12:50,432
They called me heartless,
which I could live with.

153
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:55,638
But when they forced me to give loans
to people who could never pay me back,

154
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,407
I got the hell out.

155
00:12:57,408 --> 00:13:00,312
Come. You must be hungry.

156
00:13:03,312 --> 00:13:07,417
When the politicians started
making medical decisions for me,

157
00:13:07,418 --> 00:13:09,951
I decided I couldn't
be a party to it anymore.

158
00:13:09,952 --> 00:13:14,258
Here in this valley, I treat my patients
using my professional judgment,

159
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:16,725
not some political directive.

160
00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:20,095
Dagny, we are on strike.

161
00:13:20,096 --> 00:13:24,566
What happened to Midas,
what happened to Doc,

162
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:26,072
it happened to each of us.

163
00:13:28,072 --> 00:13:31,240
No man belongs
to another, Dagny.

164
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:34,741
But there are those in power who
would have you think otherwise.

165
00:13:35,011 --> 00:13:37,314
We honor charity
and benevolence,

166
00:13:37,315 --> 00:13:40,282
but it must be provided
on the giver's terms...

167
00:13:40,283 --> 00:13:42,053
Voluntarily, and not by force.

168
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:45,754
The powerful try to make us
feel guilty for our success.

169
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:48,992
And we are guilty... guilty
for sacrificing ourselves...

170
00:13:48,993 --> 00:13:51,062
and for working
under their terms.

171
00:13:52,062 --> 00:13:55,734
So we had to withdraw,
to go on strike.

172
00:13:56,734 --> 00:13:58,969
But what about
what you left behind?

173
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,970
We left nothing behind, Dagny.

174
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:05,074
What... We took with us
the only real thing of value.

175
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:08,714
Dagny, this is a strike
of our minds.

176
00:14:10,714 --> 00:14:12,816
So what are you demanding?

177
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:16,653
Nothing. We're not trying to impose our
values on the world that we left behind.

178
00:14:16,654 --> 00:14:19,355
They're free to continue to believe
as they want, whatever they want.

179
00:14:19,356 --> 00:14:21,557
But they're going to have
to do it without our help.

180
00:14:21,558 --> 00:14:23,496
Hear, hear.

181
00:14:26,496 --> 00:14:27,830
Dagny.

182
00:14:27,831 --> 00:14:29,402
Ellis Wyatt.

183
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:33,538
I can't believe it.

184
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:36,172
I felt abandoned.

185
00:14:36,173 --> 00:14:40,109
I finished the John Galt line to move
your oil, and you disappeared on me.

186
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,881
You quit when I needed you most.

187
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:46,548
All of you did.

188
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:48,484
Now you know why.

189
00:14:48,485 --> 00:14:53,489
Well, perhaps, but you made a very
difficult task nearly impossible.

190
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:58,695
Dagny, I couldn't keep supporting a
system that was determined to destroy me.

191
00:14:58,696 --> 00:15:02,264
Had I let 'em, they...
They'd have never stopped.

192
00:15:02,265 --> 00:15:04,102
Everyone here knows that.

193
00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:07,737
We know what it takes
to build something...

194
00:15:07,738 --> 00:15:11,474
and how little recognition
you get from the outside world.

195
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:13,542
You deserve more.

196
00:15:13,543 --> 00:15:17,279
You deserve to hear what each of
us heard when we arrived here...

197
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,020
Well done, Dagny.
Well done.

198
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,724
<i>While the government was busy passing
the Metal Unification Act...</i>

199
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:30,826
<i>to try and solve the steel shortage
through greater regulation,</i>

200
00:15:30,827 --> 00:15:34,630
<i>Ragnar Danneskold sunk several
more ships carrying copper,</i>

201
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:37,804
<i>resulting in more frequent
electrical outages.</i>

202
00:15:41,804 --> 00:15:44,105
<i>Dagny, I want you to stay
for one month...</i>

203
00:15:44,106 --> 00:15:49,646
just to see it all for yourself, and at
the end, you can choose to stay or go.

204
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:53,316
But while you're here,
you gotta follow our rules.

205
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:58,553
Our first rule is that no one provides
unearned sustenance for another person.

206
00:15:58,554 --> 00:16:00,190
I'll pay my own way.

207
00:16:00,191 --> 00:16:01,747
I doubt it.
You're penniless.

208
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:02,745
What?

209
00:16:02,746 --> 00:16:05,695
Well, your money
has no value here.

210
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:08,130
What do you mean?

211
00:16:08,131 --> 00:16:11,734
Well, here in the Gulch,
we deal in gold.

212
00:16:11,735 --> 00:16:13,304
I see.

213
00:16:14,304 --> 00:16:16,973
Then I'll earn my keep.

214
00:16:16,974 --> 00:16:20,076
- How?
- Hire me.

215
00:16:20,077 --> 00:16:23,979
I'll cook, clean, do laundry in
exchange for room and board...

216
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,484
and a little money for something
to wear other than this.

217
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:31,724
You... You really want
to do that?

218
00:16:33,724 --> 00:16:35,495
Yes.

219
00:16:38,495 --> 00:16:39,896
Then you're hired.

220
00:16:39,897 --> 00:16:41,000
Here.

221
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,767
An advance.

222
00:16:44,768 --> 00:16:46,268
Where did you get these?

223
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:48,182
The Mulligan bank.

224
00:17:32,182 --> 00:17:33,557
Whose house is that?

225
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:41,990
Francisco.

226
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:43,261
He was the first.

227
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:49,798
So he destroyed his reputation and the
family's copper mines for the strike?

228
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:52,501
That's not all he gave up.

229
00:17:52,502 --> 00:17:55,904
You know that he and I
were very close at one time.

230
00:17:55,905 --> 00:17:58,341
I do.

231
00:17:58,342 --> 00:18:00,110
What did he tell you?

232
00:18:00,111 --> 00:18:03,249
Nothing in particular,
but with his tone?

233
00:18:05,249 --> 00:18:07,121
Everything.

234
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:12,089
They'll be happy to see you.

235
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:48,591
Ragnar Danneskold?

236
00:18:48,592 --> 00:18:51,427
Dagny Taggart.
Have you joined us?

237
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:53,962
No, I haven't.
I'm, -

238
00:18:53,963 --> 00:18:56,332
A scab?

239
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,868
I crashed the gate.
Literally.

240
00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:01,336
So you are a scab.

241
00:19:01,337 --> 00:19:03,806
And you're a pirate.

242
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,408
Right?

243
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:10,113
I, have been accused
of making the seas unsafe.

244
00:19:10,114 --> 00:19:11,980
But only for those ships
carrying goods...

245
00:19:11,981 --> 00:19:14,650
taken by government force
from the rightful owners.

246
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:16,451
I'm just returning
what's been stolen.

247
00:19:16,452 --> 00:19:21,193
Now, if that makes me
a pirate... well, so be it.

248
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:27,040
See you around,
I'm sure.

249
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,277
- Hi, Miss Taggart.
- Oh. Hello.

250
00:19:41,278 --> 00:19:43,212
So they're not in school?

251
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:45,139
- Oh, no. I'm homeschooling them.
- Oh.

252
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,975
I joined the strike because I wouldn't
put them in an educational system...

253
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,751
that doesn't
teach them to think.

254
00:19:49,752 --> 00:19:52,220
I guess they have some great role
models around here, don't they?

255
00:19:52,221 --> 00:19:54,789
Oh, yeah. They do.
And they're very happy.

256
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,159
Oh.

257
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,660
- Have a great day.
- Thank you.

258
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,963
Thanks.

259
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:06,302
<i>As the 100th anniversary
of Taggart Bridge,</i>

260
00:20:06,303 --> 00:20:08,238
<i>America's most important
railroad overpass,</i>

261
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:10,507
<i>came and went
with little fanfare,</i>

262
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:13,543
<i>Jim Taggart continued to
intentionally mislead the public,</i>

263
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:15,143
<i>announcing that
the copper wire shortage...</i>

264
00:20:15,144 --> 00:20:19,714
<i>would not necessarily affect
transporting Minnesota's wheat.</i>

265
00:20:19,715 --> 00:20:21,983
<i>He also announced
that Dagny had died,</i>

266
00:20:21,984 --> 00:20:25,290
<i>and that her absence would not
affect railroad operations.</i>

267
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:30,028
Gentlemen, science belongs
to the people,

268
00:20:31,028 --> 00:20:33,862
not a single individual
just because he invented it.

269
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,078
Every man on the face
of the globe...

270
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:55,151
has the right to share in the advantages
created by technological progress.

271
00:20:55,152 --> 00:20:59,057
It is vitally important that we
maintain a positive public opinion.

272
00:21:00,057 --> 00:21:03,992
We can't allow criticism of
the project at this time.

273
00:21:03,993 --> 00:21:07,497
Gentlemen, we should all be very
proud to usher in this new era.

274
00:21:07,498 --> 00:21:11,968
These new instruments of peace will
protect us from any and all aggressors.

275
00:21:11,969 --> 00:21:15,970
Project F will allow us to keep order
in the streets and protect the public.

276
00:21:15,971 --> 00:21:17,373
Mr. Thompson...

277
00:21:17,374 --> 00:21:21,509
Jimmy. Sorry to hear about the
loss of your sister Dagny.

278
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,212
She'll be sorely missed.

279
00:21:23,213 --> 00:21:26,315
Thank you.
I just want you to know...

280
00:21:26,316 --> 00:21:30,854
that we really need the Railroad Unification
Act to save our transportation system.

281
00:21:31,054 --> 00:21:34,289
All for one, one for all.
I mean, that's the key here.

282
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,258
Getting things going.

283
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:40,563
In fact, we've appointed Cuffy
Meigs to direct the initiative.

284
00:21:40,564 --> 00:21:42,231
For the public good.

285
00:21:42,232 --> 00:21:44,769
Absolutely.

286
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:49,769
We need to make sure the
speech is on all the networks.

287
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:58,213
In a lot of ways,
this valley represents...

288
00:21:58,214 --> 00:22:00,716
what your great grandfather,
Nat, saw in our country...

289
00:22:00,717 --> 00:22:05,320
Unbridled opportunity, where
innovation is rewarded.

290
00:22:05,321 --> 00:22:08,324
You see, he built the Taggart
Bridge over the Mississippi...

291
00:22:08,325 --> 00:22:11,827
and connected
an entire nation by rail.

292
00:22:11,828 --> 00:22:15,698
When the courts tried to stop
him, he fought and he prevailed.

293
00:22:15,699 --> 00:22:17,499
That bridge
is still standing today.

294
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,701
True. True,
but as the country prospered,

295
00:22:19,702 --> 00:22:23,605
the people gave the government
more and more power.

296
00:22:23,606 --> 00:22:27,876
Those in charge saw successful businessmen
as a threat to their control,

297
00:22:27,877 --> 00:22:31,814
so they simply took what was created
in the name of the public good.

298
00:22:31,815 --> 00:22:34,249
So you convinced the others
to strike.

299
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,951
Each one was invited here.

300
00:22:35,952 --> 00:22:40,659
You... You're the first person to
come to this valley by accident.

301
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:44,126
If you choose to stay,

302
00:22:44,127 --> 00:22:47,429
you'll have to join us in what
we are trying to accomplish.

303
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,542
You have
an important decision to make.

304
00:22:52,035 --> 00:22:54,813
But I love the railroad
my great grandfather built.

305
00:22:58,241 --> 00:23:00,548
Good night.

306
00:23:04,502 --> 00:23:06,614
Was it as difficult
for all the others?

307
00:23:06,615 --> 00:23:08,317
The first night was.

308
00:23:08,318 --> 00:23:09,885
Is this the room
where they arrive?

309
00:23:09,886 --> 00:23:12,124
I never intended you
to occupy this room.

310
00:23:14,124 --> 00:23:15,952
Good night.

311
00:23:42,952 --> 00:23:45,554
<i>Francisco D'Anconia's
copper mines,</i>

312
00:23:45,555 --> 00:23:47,757
<i>the world's
largest remaining mines,</i>

313
00:23:47,758 --> 00:23:50,394
<i>were closed due to a series
of explosions.</i>

314
00:23:52,394 --> 00:23:56,443
<i>No workers were injured, but
no new copper was available.</i>

315
00:24:14,518 --> 00:24:16,419
Francisco.

316
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,387
You're two days late.
What happened?

317
00:24:18,388 --> 00:24:21,297
- Sorry I'm late, John.
- Come in, I'll get you a drink.

318
00:24:21,298 --> 00:24:24,727
But listen, I came to tell you
that I won't be long.

319
00:24:24,728 --> 00:24:26,728
- Francisco.
- I'm concerned...

320
00:24:27,832 --> 00:24:30,332
Dagny. It's like I can't
believe you're alive!

321
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,333
Oh.

322
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:34,571
And you're here.

323
00:24:35,571 --> 00:24:38,207
Now you know everything.

324
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:40,276
Now you understand why.

325
00:24:40,277 --> 00:24:44,444
Frisco, you should know... I'm here by
accident. I'm not part of the strike.

326
00:24:45,632 --> 00:24:47,048
How did you get here?

327
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:49,418
It's a long story.

328
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:51,487
The main thing
is that you are safe.

329
00:24:51,488 --> 00:24:52,887
He's right.

330
00:24:52,888 --> 00:24:54,888
- I'll come by later.
- All right then.

331
00:24:57,207 --> 00:24:59,194
And I want to spend
some time with you.

332
00:24:59,195 --> 00:25:00,465
Me too.

333
00:25:02,465 --> 00:25:04,300
- I'll stop by.
- Bye, John.

334
00:25:04,301 --> 00:25:05,601
Welcome back.

335
00:25:05,602 --> 00:25:09,207
I'm going to stop by the power
plant to check the output levels.

336
00:25:10,207 --> 00:25:11,973
Power plant?

337
00:25:11,974 --> 00:25:13,974
Yes.

338
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,189
Come on.

339
00:25:59,189 --> 00:26:02,223
The motor generates enough
power for the entire valley.

340
00:26:02,224 --> 00:26:05,395
In fact, it could power
the entire West Coast.

341
00:26:06,395 --> 00:26:08,463
How?

342
00:26:08,464 --> 00:26:11,600
It converts atmospheric
electricity into energy...

343
00:26:11,601 --> 00:26:13,651
at virtually no cost.

344
00:26:28,651 --> 00:26:30,651
- Is this it?
- Yes.

345
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:34,556
I can't believe this powers
the entire valley.

346
00:26:34,557 --> 00:26:38,294
No amount of force will grant
you access to that motor.

347
00:26:38,295 --> 00:26:40,163
Allow me.

348
00:26:41,163 --> 00:26:43,932
I swear by my life
and my love of it...

349
00:26:43,933 --> 00:26:46,567
that I will never live
for the sake of another man...

350
00:26:46,568 --> 00:26:48,872
nor ask another man
to live for mine.

351
00:26:58,714 --> 00:27:00,852
Not yet.

352
00:27:02,852 --> 00:27:06,555
Everyone has taken that oath
who lives in this valley.

353
00:27:06,556 --> 00:27:08,457
Everyone except you.

354
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:10,192
Well, that's what I do.

355
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:11,861
I live for myself,
not for others,

356
00:27:12,061 --> 00:27:15,364
just, unlike you, I don't believe
in abandoning the fight.

357
00:27:15,365 --> 00:27:20,602
Well, we're going to have to see
which one of us is wrong.

358
00:27:20,603 --> 00:27:23,971
Until then, I know you won't say
those words until you mean them...

359
00:27:23,972 --> 00:27:26,919
the way they're intended.

360
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:17,519
I still don't understand why
you don't use mules, Francisco.

361
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,221
Mules, John? These animals
are not so friendly.

362
00:29:20,222 --> 00:29:22,124
They're just as stubborn
as women.

363
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:24,692
Frisco, you are wasting an
unconscionable amount of time...

364
00:29:24,693 --> 00:29:26,295
bringing your copper ore
up this way.

365
00:29:26,296 --> 00:29:28,930
You ought to build a rail
line down to the smelter.

366
00:29:28,931 --> 00:29:31,066
I know, but it's
such a difficult job.

367
00:29:31,067 --> 00:29:33,803
Besides, the mine's output
doesn't justify the expense.

368
00:29:34,003 --> 00:29:35,872
That's nonsense. You see
that pass to the east?

369
00:29:35,873 --> 00:29:38,590
- Uh-huh.
- It's an easier grade with softer stone.

370
00:29:38,591 --> 00:29:40,241
It wouldn't take
a lot of curves.

371
00:29:40,242 --> 00:29:43,845
Maybe three miles of rail,
narrow gauge.

372
00:29:43,846 --> 00:29:45,381
- You have a pen and paper?
- Here.

373
00:29:45,382 --> 00:29:47,482
It'll pay for itself
in three years.

374
00:29:47,483 --> 00:29:51,287
Here. Look. I might have to blast a
tunnel here, a few hundred feet or less,

375
00:29:51,288 --> 00:29:55,624
and I'd need a steel trestle to
bring the track across this gorge.

376
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:57,460
We'd bring it down here.

377
00:29:57,461 --> 00:30:01,530
It's not that difficult, and it would cut
off that last mile of corkscrew turns.

378
00:30:01,531 --> 00:30:04,836
I could have the track laid
in three months.

379
00:30:06,836 --> 00:30:09,372
Oh, what for?

380
00:30:09,373 --> 00:30:11,839
Abandon an entire
transcontinental system...

381
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,976
to build
three miles of railroad.

382
00:30:13,977 --> 00:30:16,755
If you change your mind,
I'll hire you on the spot.

383
00:30:17,371 --> 00:30:20,149
Or Midas can give you a loan
if you want to own it.

384
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:22,918
No, I can't.
Not yet.

385
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:26,588
I wish I could just stay here and never know
what my brother is doing to the railroad.

386
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:29,029
Well, you would hear about it...
every wreck, every explosion,

387
00:30:29,058 --> 00:30:30,660
every broken line.

388
00:30:30,661 --> 00:30:33,863
And eventually, the collapse
of the Taggart Bridge.

389
00:30:33,864 --> 00:30:35,396
That's not going to happen.

390
00:30:35,397 --> 00:30:38,135
Dagny, nobody stays here
by faking reality.

391
00:30:40,135 --> 00:30:42,104
Well, I'll get back
to my job then.

392
00:30:42,105 --> 00:30:45,251
Enjoy your last week, Dagny.

393
00:30:55,251 --> 00:30:57,553
Here's a question for you...

394
00:30:57,554 --> 00:31:02,391
If Taggart Transcontinental
were your own company,

395
00:31:02,392 --> 00:31:04,526
would you hire your brother Jim?

396
00:31:04,527 --> 00:31:07,864
Good God, no. No, I wouldn't
hire him as a track worker.

397
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:09,831
I mean, he's... he's
completely incompetent.

398
00:31:09,832 --> 00:31:14,972
Then why do Jim and all of his
cronies have so much power?

399
00:31:16,972 --> 00:31:18,575
Why do they?

400
00:31:21,111 --> 00:31:25,514
Because they promote
the idea that it's okay...

401
00:31:25,515 --> 00:31:28,549
to take from one man,
give to another.

402
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:32,320
Dagny, all of your life,
you've heard people saying...

403
00:31:32,321 --> 00:31:36,191
that we have to help
the less fortunate,

404
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,727
that the measure of virtue is...

405
00:31:38,728 --> 00:31:42,581
Is not what you achieve,
but what you do for others.

406
00:31:43,832 --> 00:31:45,249
You... You've heard them say...

407
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:49,770
that people have a right to a
living just because they're human.

408
00:31:49,771 --> 00:31:53,075
And that's not the right to<i> earn</i> a
living, that is a right<i> to</i> a living,

409
00:31:53,076 --> 00:31:56,314
which you are required
to provide for them.

410
00:31:57,314 --> 00:32:01,216
Now, do you see
any common themes here?

411
00:32:01,217 --> 00:32:04,953
Need of others paramount,
your needs secondary?

412
00:32:04,954 --> 00:32:09,658
Their philosophy is based on how
much you sacrifice to other people,

413
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:12,329
not on what you achieve.

414
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:16,198
That philosophy can't work.

415
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:20,903
Unless you continue to work
and work and work and work...

416
00:32:20,904 --> 00:32:24,972
and try to overcome all the obstacles
which they have created for you.

417
00:32:24,973 --> 00:32:27,476
And no matter how much
they take from you,

418
00:32:27,477 --> 00:32:30,912
they still count on your
work ethic, your integrity,

419
00:32:30,913 --> 00:32:34,318
your desire to keep producing.

420
00:32:36,318 --> 00:32:38,120
But I... I love what I do.

421
00:32:38,121 --> 00:32:41,989
No, I know.
Yeah, so did John.

422
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:45,260
Yeah, but he refused
to accept their ideas.

423
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:50,132
He refused to put
his ability... his motor...

424
00:32:50,133 --> 00:32:52,400
At their disposal.

425
00:32:52,401 --> 00:32:54,536
As long as you continue
to accept it,

426
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:59,511
they will continue to exploit
your extraordinary abilities.

427
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:05,213
<i>While Thompson and his cronies
were holed up...</i>

428
00:33:05,214 --> 00:33:07,450
<i>in the Wayne-Falkland Hotel
in New York,</i>

429
00:33:07,451 --> 00:33:10,485
<i>preparing for his big speech
on November 23,</i>

430
00:33:10,486 --> 00:33:14,001
<i>Henry Rearden continued
his search for Dagny Taggart.</i>

431
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,210
John, that's Hank Rearden, one
man you have yet to bring here...

432
00:33:35,211 --> 00:33:37,481
One you wanted for some time.

433
00:33:39,481 --> 00:33:42,383
Maybe Francisco
can convince him.

434
00:33:42,384 --> 00:33:44,565
Maybe.

435
00:33:55,565 --> 00:33:58,200
So, how was the lecture tonight?

436
00:33:58,201 --> 00:33:59,272
Well...

437
00:34:03,272 --> 00:34:05,042
John, what is it?

438
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:09,278
You've got something
on your mind.

439
00:34:09,279 --> 00:34:11,150
I know you too well, my friend.

440
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,554
Of all of us here,

441
00:34:17,554 --> 00:34:20,797
I know that you're the one
who's given up the most.

442
00:34:27,797 --> 00:34:30,668
I'll be all right, John.

443
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:33,815
It's time to get Hank.

444
00:34:44,815 --> 00:34:46,585
We're out of chocolate cake.

445
00:34:48,585 --> 00:34:50,317
Oh, you scared me.

446
00:34:50,318 --> 00:34:52,553
What are you doing?

447
00:34:52,554 --> 00:34:55,790
Well, I told you.
I've been watching you.

448
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:57,259
I couldn't sleep.

449
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,529
My mind's racing. You?

450
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:02,541
Well, I have a stranger
in my house.

451
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:13,341
When's the first time
you saw me?

452
00:35:13,342 --> 00:35:15,347
I remember that well.

453
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:19,381
<i>You were standing on
the Taggart passenger platform.</i>

454
00:35:19,382 --> 00:35:21,383
<i>You were wearing
an evening gown and a shawl,</i>

455
00:35:21,384 --> 00:35:23,451
<i>and if your shawl
had slipped any further down,</i>

456
00:35:23,452 --> 00:35:26,721
you'd have been
standing there naked.

457
00:35:26,722 --> 00:35:28,290
And you belonged there.

458
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:33,194
Not in some silk-curtained
sitting room, but there.

459
00:35:33,195 --> 00:35:35,534
Among the rails.

460
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:41,870
Did you see that plane
circling the valley today?

461
00:35:41,871 --> 00:35:43,738
Yes.

462
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:45,043
That was Hank Rearden.

463
00:35:47,043 --> 00:35:49,289
He's a good man.

464
00:36:00,289 --> 00:36:03,512
<i>Anticipating greater unrest,
the State Science Institute...</i>

465
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:08,230
<i>began developing crude, but
lethal, crowd-control devices.</i>

466
00:36:08,231 --> 00:36:09,897
<i>As the Unification Board...</i>

467
00:36:09,898 --> 00:36:13,768
<i>remained incapable of clearing the
rockslide blocking the Taggart Tunnel,</i>

468
00:36:13,769 --> 00:36:16,576
<i>cross-country transportation
was now crippled.</i>

469
00:36:19,576 --> 00:36:21,114
So, Dagny...

470
00:36:24,114 --> 00:36:26,381
Have you made your decision?

471
00:36:26,382 --> 00:36:29,052
I think so.

472
00:36:30,052 --> 00:36:32,421
But I'm not sure.

473
00:36:32,422 --> 00:36:35,256
And it's too important
not to be completely certain.

474
00:36:35,979 --> 00:36:37,591
If any of your uncertainty...

475
00:36:37,592 --> 00:36:41,696
is a conflict between
your heart and your mind,

476
00:36:41,697 --> 00:36:43,363
follow your mind.

477
00:36:43,364 --> 00:36:45,476
That wasn't the advice
I was expecting.

478
00:36:47,268 --> 00:36:49,705
Let it go until it's time.

479
00:36:49,706 --> 00:36:51,540
We still have you
with us tonight.

480
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:57,111
Francisco, you'll be back
in a few months.

481
00:36:57,112 --> 00:36:58,712
November at the latest.

482
00:36:58,713 --> 00:37:01,817
And, John, you're not returning
to New York this time, are you?

483
00:37:01,818 --> 00:37:03,785
I haven't decided yet.

484
00:37:03,786 --> 00:37:06,288
You're not thinking about going
back to that hell, are you?

485
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:07,922
I am.

486
00:37:07,923 --> 00:37:09,624
But, John, why?

487
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:13,361
Well, I'll tell you
once I've decided.

488
00:37:13,362 --> 00:37:14,830
But everyone's here except Hank,

489
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,464
and he'll be here soon enough.

490
00:37:16,465 --> 00:37:18,299
And Dagny, if she chooses.

491
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,980
Your job is done. There's nothing
more for you to look for out there.

492
00:37:21,003 --> 00:37:22,904
I know.

493
00:37:22,905 --> 00:37:25,906
When the rails are nationalized,
everything will collapse.

494
00:37:25,907 --> 00:37:27,776
Why risk it?

495
00:37:27,777 --> 00:37:30,712
They are getting serious
about the disappearances.

496
00:37:30,713 --> 00:37:34,158
They suspect something. You, of
all people, shouldn't be there.

497
00:37:35,028 --> 00:37:36,917
The infrastructure's
falling apart.

498
00:37:36,918 --> 00:37:40,589
Just the physical risk of complex
machinery in the hands of blind fools...

499
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,890
You'll be taking a chance
every time you step on a train.

500
00:37:42,891 --> 00:37:44,892
There's been one collision
after another.

501
00:37:44,893 --> 00:37:48,129
Not to mention the weapons the SSI have
been testing to maintain the peace,

502
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,698
as they say.

503
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:52,336
If I go back,
it won't be for the strike.

504
00:37:54,336 --> 00:37:57,376
It'll be to get the only thing
I want for myself.

505
00:38:00,376 --> 00:38:01,821
There's going to be riots.

506
00:38:03,144 --> 00:38:04,879
Electricity's being rationed.

507
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,482
Food supply chains
are being severed.

508
00:38:07,483 --> 00:38:11,352
In no time at all, there'll be one train
a week, and then one train a month,

509
00:38:11,353 --> 00:38:12,854
and then the Taggart Bridge
will collapse.

510
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:14,063
No.

511
00:38:21,063 --> 00:38:23,599
No. That won't happen.

512
00:38:24,544 --> 00:38:26,267
Then you've made your decision.

513
00:38:26,268 --> 00:38:28,169
I have.

514
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:32,073
As long as I am alive, I will not
desert a battle that is mine to fight.

515
00:38:32,074 --> 00:38:34,709
You'll be back, Dagny.

516
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,947
And we'll be here
waiting for you.

517
00:38:37,547 --> 00:38:40,348
We need to discuss the
conditions of your departure.

518
00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:43,451
First, you have to give us your word that you
won't disclose anything about this valley.

519
00:38:43,452 --> 00:38:45,819
You can't reveal
our... our cause,

520
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,957
our existence, your whereabouts
for the past month,

521
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:50,347
to anyone for any reason.

522
00:38:51,293 --> 00:38:52,861
I give you my word.

523
00:38:52,862 --> 00:38:56,452
Second, you never attempt
to come back uninvited again.

524
00:39:16,452 --> 00:39:19,120
Have you decided?

525
00:39:19,121 --> 00:39:20,496
Are you going back?

526
00:39:29,864 --> 00:39:31,702
Yes.

527
00:39:32,469 --> 00:39:34,803
But Frisco said it's
too dangerous for you.

528
00:39:35,003 --> 00:39:36,638
I don't want you to go.

529
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:38,473
It's not up to you.

530
00:39:38,474 --> 00:39:40,875
You're going for my sake.

531
00:39:40,876 --> 00:39:42,045
No, for mine.

532
00:39:44,045 --> 00:39:45,981
Will we see each other?

533
00:39:46,981 --> 00:39:48,482
No.

534
00:39:48,483 --> 00:39:51,185
Will you be watching me?

535
00:39:51,186 --> 00:39:52,819
More so.

536
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,888
Why?

537
00:39:54,889 --> 00:39:57,759
To be there the day
you decide to join us.

538
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,596
What if I told you
I will never join you?

539
00:40:01,597 --> 00:40:04,533
- That would be a lie.
- John, the risk!

540
00:40:04,784 --> 00:40:07,964
I wouldn't do it if I had
no selfish end to gain.

541
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,827
What selfish end?

542
00:40:15,077 --> 00:40:16,376
I want you here.

543
00:40:56,251 --> 00:40:59,090
I need to make sure you
can't find your way back.

544
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:10,393
You'll find
a Taggart station in town.

545
00:42:11,393 --> 00:42:12,393
Don't look for me.

546
00:42:13,028 --> 00:42:17,155
When you need me, I'll be the
easiest man in the world to find.

547
00:43:14,155 --> 00:43:15,655
- Hank.
-<i> Dagny?</i>

548
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:17,392
I'm so sorry.

549
00:43:17,393 --> 00:43:19,426
<i>It's okay.
You don't need to apologize.</i>

550
00:43:19,427 --> 00:43:21,229
<i>There's something
I have to tell you.</i>

551
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:23,296
<i>I'm just happy
to hear your voice,</i>

552
00:43:23,297 --> 00:43:25,433
<i>to know you're all right.</i>

553
00:43:25,434 --> 00:43:28,102
<i>What we had together is a
memory I will always cherish.</i>

554
00:43:28,103 --> 00:43:30,103
<i>- I'm so sorry, Hank.
- I'm happy, Dagny.</i>

555
00:43:30,706 --> 00:43:33,441
<i>I've got to run.
Frisco is waiting.</i>

556
00:43:33,442 --> 00:43:35,709
<i>We'll see each other soon.</i>

557
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,315
<i>Who is John Galt?</i>

558
00:43:40,915 --> 00:43:42,995
<i>Jim Taggart scheduled
a press conference...</i>

559
00:43:43,018 --> 00:43:46,687
<i>announcing the sudden return of
his sister Dagny to New York.</i>

560
00:43:46,688 --> 00:43:49,758
<i>Meanwhile, several Rearden
steelworkers died defending a mill...</i>

561
00:43:49,759 --> 00:43:53,204
<i>against a violent takeover by
government-sponsored union thugs.</i>

562
00:43:54,919 --> 00:43:57,531
<i>At the same time,
the diverted Taggart trains...</i>

563
00:43:57,532 --> 00:44:01,255
<i>stopped transporting badly needed
Minnesota wheat to the East Coast.</i>

564
00:44:11,438 --> 00:44:15,716
I'm not accustomed to being dragged away
from the SSI without rhyme or reason.

565
00:44:15,717 --> 00:44:18,085
Dr. Stadler. Precisely.

566
00:44:18,086 --> 00:44:20,824
Which makes me appreciate you
all the more.

567
00:44:21,824 --> 00:44:23,625
Why am I here?

568
00:44:23,626 --> 00:44:27,465
Walk with me. I have another
meeting in five minutes.

569
00:44:30,065 --> 00:44:34,768
Dr. Stadler, more than ever, the government
needs to present a strong, unified front...

570
00:44:34,769 --> 00:44:37,372
to bolster the confidence
of the people.

571
00:44:37,373 --> 00:44:39,841
The head of state has
a grand vision for the future.

572
00:44:40,041 --> 00:44:43,810
And he expects the full support
of the State Science Institute,

573
00:44:43,811 --> 00:44:46,580
namely your full support
on our current project.

574
00:44:46,581 --> 00:44:49,484
My full support for what?

575
00:44:49,485 --> 00:44:51,151
You'll get the specifics later.

576
00:44:51,152 --> 00:44:53,721
Now listen carefully, Doctor.

577
00:44:53,722 --> 00:44:56,624
What I'm about to share with
you is highly confidential...

578
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:59,331
and crucial
to the nation's welfare.

579
00:45:02,331 --> 00:45:04,240
"Project F"?

580
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,812
Why, this looks like
an instrument of torture.

581
00:45:16,813 --> 00:45:18,879
Why wasn't I told about this?

582
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,484
How dare you use my research to
create this... this... this weapon?

583
00:45:23,485 --> 00:45:27,221
I didn't spend eight years to see
my research turned into this.

584
00:45:27,222 --> 00:45:29,445
I mean, I have...
Your signature, Doctor.

585
00:45:30,025 --> 00:45:31,725
The public needs to know...

586
00:45:31,726 --> 00:45:35,663
the tax money spent on SSI
research serves the public.

587
00:45:35,664 --> 00:45:40,968
I founded the SSI to expand
the frontiers of knowledge.

588
00:45:40,969 --> 00:45:44,372
This is not the time
for impractical idealism.

589
00:45:44,373 --> 00:45:49,176
The motive for Project F
is not up for discussion.

590
00:45:49,177 --> 00:45:52,680
Consider yourself informed,
Doctor.

591
00:45:52,681 --> 00:45:55,683
What if I don't want
to give my support?

592
00:45:55,684 --> 00:45:59,257
What if I don't agree with
this... this abomination?

593
00:46:01,257 --> 00:46:02,965
Well, then.

594
00:46:43,965 --> 00:46:45,500
<i>...all operations.</i>

595
00:46:45,501 --> 00:46:47,468
<i>In other news,
Head of State Thompson said...</i>

596
00:46:47,469 --> 00:46:50,705
<i>there is no national problem
with aviation safety...</i>

597
00:46:50,706 --> 00:46:56,743
<i>despite yesterday's Amalgamated Airlines
crash which killed 35 passengers.</i>

598
00:46:56,744 --> 00:46:58,717
Just do it, Eddie.

599
00:47:01,717 --> 00:47:05,293
You've been Dagny's right-hand man
for years, so take care of it.

600
00:47:11,293 --> 00:47:14,293
-<i> Dagny...</i>
- I'll be with you in a minute.

601
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:18,399
Just cancel the Comet for the
schedule for tomorrow and Tuesday.

602
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,512
Fire the engines to Arizona
for the grapefruit special...

603
00:47:22,036 --> 00:47:24,138
and send the orders out
immediately.

604
00:47:24,139 --> 00:47:25,806
You'll do nothing of the kind.

605
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:29,782
Minnesota needs that line
to move the harvest.

606
00:47:33,782 --> 00:47:35,621
Send the orders.

607
00:47:38,621 --> 00:47:40,931
Excuse me.

608
00:47:49,931 --> 00:47:52,600
Thank God.

609
00:47:52,601 --> 00:47:55,470
Dagny, I thought that... You're
not sending any orders.

610
00:47:55,471 --> 00:47:57,939
But Washington sent him here to
oversee the Railroad Unification Act.

611
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,607
Washington doesn't run
this railroad. I do.

612
00:48:00,608 --> 00:48:01,709
Dagny.

613
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,276
I, -
Jim.

614
00:48:03,277 --> 00:48:05,312
Heard the good news you're okay.

615
00:48:05,313 --> 00:48:06,980
I'm, -

616
00:48:06,981 --> 00:48:10,484
I'm glad you're back. Alive.

617
00:48:10,485 --> 00:48:13,288
There are some urgent... the
most urgent thing now is...

618
00:48:13,289 --> 00:48:16,191
for you to go to the press
and tell them you didn't quit.

619
00:48:16,192 --> 00:48:18,592
I'm not doing any press. No, you have to.
They've been all...

620
00:48:18,693 --> 00:48:22,428
I'm not going to reassure the public
about the state of our industry, Jim.

621
00:48:22,429 --> 00:48:24,864
What is this
Railroad Unification Act?

622
00:48:24,865 --> 00:48:30,904
Well, it's a new national setup that went
into effect about three weeks ago...

623
00:48:30,905 --> 00:48:33,707
which you will approve of and
appreciate and find extremely good...

624
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:35,375
for Taggart Transcontinental.

625
00:48:35,376 --> 00:48:36,810
What is it?

626
00:48:36,811 --> 00:48:40,814
You are aware we are in
an emergency situation, right?

627
00:48:40,815 --> 00:48:44,752
The country's top priority is to
preserve the transportation industry.

628
00:48:44,753 --> 00:48:46,221
The national
survival requires...

629
00:48:46,222 --> 00:48:48,689
What is the plan?
What does it do?

630
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:52,862
Every railroad in the country has
been unified into a single team.

631
00:48:53,862 --> 00:48:55,367
Pooling their resources.

632
00:48:59,367 --> 00:49:01,502
You've nationalized
the railroad.

633
00:49:01,503 --> 00:49:02,970
No skin off your back.

634
00:49:02,971 --> 00:49:04,839
Cuffy.
Cuffy, please.

635
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,374
Dagny, under the act,

636
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:09,643
all of the gross revenue
will be turned over...

637
00:49:09,644 --> 00:49:12,178
to the Railroad Pool Board
in Washington...

638
00:49:12,179 --> 00:49:15,818
where it will then be distributed on a
more modern principle of distribution...

639
00:49:16,018 --> 00:49:17,118
What principle?

640
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,319
You know...
You know, we're fine.

641
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,522
This is good for business.

642
00:49:21,523 --> 00:49:24,125
You know, we're doing...
We're doing great.

643
00:49:24,126 --> 00:49:26,070
We'll finish this later.

644
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:41,543
<i>Are you seein' what
I'm seein' up there, boss?</i>

645
00:49:42,543 --> 00:49:44,946
The electrical wire's
been compromised.

646
00:49:44,947 --> 00:49:46,947
-<i> Switches are out.</i>
- It's not my fault!

647
00:49:46,948 --> 00:49:49,255
Look, you're on your own.

648
00:50:01,463 --> 00:50:03,463
- Operations.
-<i> Is this Eddie Willers?</i>

649
00:50:03,864 --> 00:50:07,835
Hey, it's not my place to tell
you, but nobody else will.

650
00:50:07,836 --> 00:50:10,770
-<i> We're about to have a disaster on our hands.</i>
- Who is this?

651
00:50:10,771 --> 00:50:13,874
I'm a lineman in your California division.
Let's leave it at that.

652
00:50:13,875 --> 00:50:16,176
<i>They tell me it's orders
from the Unification Board...</i>

653
00:50:16,177 --> 00:50:17,678
<i>and to mind
my own damn business.</i>

654
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:19,719
-<i> What's your name?</i>
- It doesn't matter. I'm outta here.

655
00:50:19,847 --> 00:50:21,549
<i>Good luck.</i>

656
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:23,255
Wait!

657
00:50:28,255 --> 00:50:31,859
<i>Thompson's PR people were heavily
promoting his big speech,</i>

658
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:35,335
<i>predicting it would be the
most-watched broadcast in history.</i>

659
00:50:41,105 --> 00:50:45,439
You tell that little con artist I've
already got the rail offsets fast-tracked.

660
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,107
I just...

661
00:50:47,108 --> 00:50:49,509
It is a complete disaster, Jim.

662
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:51,444
What are you talking about?
What disaster?

663
00:50:51,445 --> 00:50:53,680
Your Railroad Unification Plan.

664
00:50:53,681 --> 00:50:55,716
- We're going over a cliff.
- What?

665
00:50:55,717 --> 00:50:57,685
The board has hijacked
all our rolling stock.

666
00:50:57,686 --> 00:50:59,754
The harvests are rotting
in Minnesota.

667
00:50:59,755 --> 00:51:02,723
And we don't have the copper wire
we need to keep the lines running.

668
00:51:02,724 --> 00:51:04,357
That's not true.

669
00:51:04,358 --> 00:51:06,827
They prioritize the projects
vital to public welfare.

670
00:51:07,027 --> 00:51:08,662
Some will just have to
wait their turn.

671
00:51:08,663 --> 00:51:11,397
Well, you tell that to the family
that's about to run out of food.

672
00:51:11,398 --> 00:51:13,067
No, no. Don't...
Don't be so dramatic.

673
00:51:13,068 --> 00:51:15,403
Dramatic?
What are you thinking?

674
00:51:15,404 --> 00:51:17,939
We are the last railroad
that can move the harvests.

675
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:21,174
If we don't get trains out there, the
East Coast will run out of food.

676
00:51:21,175 --> 00:51:24,111
So what do you wanna do about it?
You're the problem solver around here.

677
00:51:24,112 --> 00:51:25,814
Yeah, I am.

678
00:51:25,815 --> 00:51:28,649
And what if I woke up one day
and just said,

679
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:30,951
"I'm not gonna find
a way today"?

680
00:51:30,952 --> 00:51:32,419
What if I just left?

681
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:34,654
Hell, you've been gone for a
month doing who knows what.

682
00:51:34,655 --> 00:51:37,725
Who do you think has been taking
care of business around here?

683
00:51:37,726 --> 00:51:39,099
No one.

684
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:11,225
Yeah. I need you to check this
one again, Eddie. Will you?

685
00:52:11,226 --> 00:52:13,226
- I'm on it.
- Thank you.

686
00:52:13,426 --> 00:52:15,663
What is it? Did they
release the  rolling stock?

687
00:52:15,664 --> 00:52:18,399
There's a very important dinner
tomorrow night at the Wayne-Falkland.

688
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,100
I promised the boys
that you'd be there.

689
00:52:20,101 --> 00:52:22,669
Seriously, Jim. A dinner? Do you
have any idea what's going on here?

690
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:24,673
- Thompson's inner circle will be there.
- Why?

691
00:52:24,873 --> 00:52:26,941
We're gonna talk about
shipping the harvests.

692
00:52:26,942 --> 00:52:28,908
You want to be in on
that decision, don't you?

693
00:52:28,909 --> 00:52:31,312
They're gonna decide how to
save the harvest at a dinner?

694
00:52:31,313 --> 00:52:34,214
If you really want to help your
farmer friends, now's your chance.

695
00:52:34,215 --> 00:52:36,149
Friends?
They're our customers, Jim.

696
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:38,453
Listen, it's formal,
but don't overdo it.

697
00:52:38,454 --> 00:52:40,923
It would please them.
 
698
00:52:41,923 --> 00:52:43,701
Tell me you're joking.

699
00:52:52,701 --> 00:52:55,803
Nobody, not even Dagny Taggart,

700
00:52:55,804 --> 00:52:58,638
will deny that there are times
when it's necessary...

701
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:02,509
to sacrifice the parts
for the sake of the whole.

702
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:05,750
What parts are we talking about,
Mr. Meigs?

703
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:10,786
Well, the sickly parts,
of course.

704
00:53:11,786 --> 00:53:13,921
Like Minnesota.

705
00:53:13,922 --> 00:53:16,424
They have to be sacrificed
in order to save the whole...

706
00:53:16,425 --> 00:53:19,859
The entire system.

707
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,895
Sacrifice Minnesota?

708
00:53:21,896 --> 00:53:23,497
Well, yes.

709
00:53:23,498 --> 00:53:25,765
We have to keep cross-country
routing intact...

710
00:53:25,766 --> 00:53:28,067
in case we need to move
troops between states.

711
00:53:28,068 --> 00:53:31,238
You understand. Balance
peacekeeping with the recovery.

712
00:53:31,239 --> 00:53:33,009
To keep order.

713
00:53:35,009 --> 00:53:38,979
You cut off Minnesota,
you cut off the supply of wheat.

714
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:42,018
You might be able to
sacrifice an arm or a leg,

715
00:53:43,018 --> 00:53:47,921
but you cannot save a body by
sacrificing its heart or its brain.

716
00:53:47,922 --> 00:53:49,790
Well, we're depending upon...

717
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:54,294
the local farmers in the
Northeast to pick up the slack.

718
00:53:54,295 --> 00:53:57,131
We're counting on it.

719
00:53:57,132 --> 00:54:01,201
There aren't enough local farmers
to feed a population that size.

720
00:54:01,202 --> 00:54:03,337
You know, Miss Taggart,

721
00:54:03,338 --> 00:54:06,239
it's a great responsibility...

722
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,408
to hold the decision
of life or death...

723
00:54:09,409 --> 00:54:11,578
over millions of people...

724
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:14,251
Sacrifice thousands,
if necessary.

725
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:19,690
But we must have
the courage to do so.

726
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:25,628
We have to be practical,
scientific.

727
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:28,628
- Public welfare is one...
- Pipe down, Jimmy.

728
00:54:28,629 --> 00:54:30,196
Of our biggest...

729
00:54:30,197 --> 00:54:33,366
Cuffy, there's trouble
in California.

730
00:54:33,367 --> 00:54:36,370
There's talk of seceding
from the union.

731
00:54:36,371 --> 00:54:38,205
Oregon's overrun by gangs.

732
00:54:38,206 --> 00:54:40,206
They've murdered
two tax collectors.

733
00:54:41,643 --> 00:54:42,643
Excuse me.

734
00:54:48,115 --> 00:54:50,317
Cuffy's right.

735
00:54:50,318 --> 00:54:52,319
Let's move the rail stock
from Minnesota.

736
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,423
Eddie. What?

737
00:54:56,423 --> 00:54:58,094
How long ago?

738
00:55:00,094 --> 00:55:02,562
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

739
00:55:02,563 --> 00:55:04,131
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- Dagny?

740
00:55:04,132 --> 00:55:07,299
- Da... Dagny, where are you going?
- Sit down, Jimmy boy.

741
00:55:11,405 --> 00:55:14,344
We're droppin' Minnesota.

742
00:55:54,648 --> 00:55:56,183
- Jeff.
- Miss Taggart.

743
00:55:56,184 --> 00:55:58,620
- What's the matter?
- Switching signals are dead.

744
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:01,321
I got four inbound trains,
two outgoing, all frozen.

745
00:56:01,322 --> 00:56:03,424
I can't get 'em out
of the damn tunnels.

746
00:56:03,425 --> 00:56:05,359
We can't seem to find
the breach in the system.

747
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,663
I'm telling you, Miss Taggart, there's just
no guidelines for this kind of emergency.

748
00:56:08,664 --> 00:56:10,333
I'll take care of it.

749
00:56:12,333 --> 00:56:14,868
Eddie, where's
the systems engineer?

750
00:56:14,869 --> 00:56:16,404
<i>Can't find him.</i>

751
00:56:16,405 --> 00:56:18,171
Call Chicago Southern.

752
00:56:18,172 --> 00:56:21,207
Tell them to get their systems guy
out of bed and get him down here.

753
00:56:21,208 --> 00:56:24,511
- Tell them I'll pay whatever it costs.
-<i> I'm on it.</i>

754
00:56:24,512 --> 00:56:26,212
We'll make
our own guidelines, Jeff.

755
00:56:26,213 --> 00:56:29,750
Get all of our nonadministrative
people out here... all of 'em.

756
00:56:29,751 --> 00:56:32,352
Section hands, track walkers,
whoever's in the terminal...

757
00:56:32,353 --> 00:56:34,455
- I want them here now.
- Here?

758
00:56:34,456 --> 00:56:38,926
I'm responsible. Get every source light
and lantern you can lay your hands on.

759
00:56:38,927 --> 00:56:41,828
Then get some red and green
cellophane and tape.

760
00:56:41,829 --> 00:56:43,829
- Lanterns?
- Lanterns. Get going.

761
00:56:44,029 --> 00:56:46,366
- Yes, ma'am.
- What are we doing here, Miss Taggart?

762
00:56:46,367 --> 00:56:48,367
- We're going to move the trains.
- How?

763
00:56:48,802 --> 00:56:53,140
By hand. I want you to put a man
with a light at each switch.

764
00:56:53,141 --> 00:56:56,141
- That could take all night!
- And all day tomorrow, if that's what it takes.

765
00:56:56,142 --> 00:56:58,198
But these trains will move.
Excuse me.

766
00:57:01,115 --> 00:57:04,417
-<i> Bring it in!</i> - Hey, hey.
- Come on in, guys.

767
00:57:04,418 --> 00:57:06,418
- Hey, listen up, guys!
- Hey.

768
00:57:11,992 --> 00:57:13,426
I'm Dagny Taggart.

769
00:57:13,427 --> 00:57:16,964
The instructions you are about
to receive come from me.

770
00:57:16,965 --> 00:57:21,100
The men who issue them are
acting under my instructions.

771
00:57:21,101 --> 00:57:24,270
The tower director will assign
the switchmen to their posts.

772
00:57:24,271 --> 00:57:27,841
I count on each of you...

773
00:57:27,842 --> 00:57:30,384
to get the trains rolling
and to...

774
00:57:35,384 --> 00:57:37,820
Something wrong, Miss Taggart?

775
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:40,754
Go ahead.
Assign the posts.

776
00:57:40,755 --> 00:57:42,755
- Let's do this.
- Let's go!

777
00:59:35,635 --> 00:59:37,909
Hey, I can see the signal!

778
00:59:40,909 --> 00:59:44,643
It's workin'!
It's actually workin'!

779
00:59:44,644 --> 00:59:46,096
Son of a gun.

780
01:00:01,096 --> 01:00:03,231
Who's John Galt?

781
01:00:09,971 --> 01:00:12,305
<i>When the Rearden steel mills
fell silent...</i>

782
01:00:12,306 --> 01:00:13,741
<i>after Hank's disappearance,</i>

783
01:00:13,742 --> 01:00:16,812
<i>the Unification Board called him
a greedy, selfish capitalist,</i>

784
01:00:17,012 --> 01:00:20,948
<i>while Thompson promised to announce greater
reforms to get things back on track.</i>

785
01:00:20,949 --> 01:00:23,149
<i>At the same time,
Cherryl Taggart, Jim's wife,</i>

786
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:25,317
<i>learned she had married a fraud.</i>

787
01:00:25,318 --> 01:00:28,443
<i>Jim Taggart was not the man
she thought he was.</i>

788
01:00:52,346 --> 01:00:53,545
- Floyd?
-<i> Hey, Jimmy.</i>

789
01:00:53,546 --> 01:00:55,448
Yeah, I just read
the article about Cherryl.

790 
01:00:55,449 --> 01:00:58,449
-<i> Yeah, that's... No, that's not my fault.</i>
- Right. Right.

791
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:00,719
-<i> I had nothing to do with it.</i>
- Sure.

792
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:02,043
<i>It's tragic. I just...</i>

793
01:01:03,023 --> 01:01:06,727
Say, your sister's gonna
help Thompson, right?

794
01:01:06,728 --> 01:01:08,627
<i>Yeah. No, I'm gonna...
I mean, she is.</i>

795
01:01:08,628 --> 01:01:10,003
<i>I'm gonna get her to be on
stage with him.</i>

796
01:01:10,004 --> 01:01:12,754
All right... yeah.

797
01:01:16,892 --> 01:01:18,837
<i>It's gonna help
the underprivileged.</i>

798
01:01:18,838 --> 01:01:20,339
That's something
you should know about.

799
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:22,542
You're always so damn
anxious to hide the fact...

800
01:01:22,543 --> 01:01:24,210
that you come from the slums.

801
01:01:24,211 --> 01:01:27,446
I'm a genius! I'm gonna have more money
than you could possibly imagine.

802
01:01:27,447 --> 01:01:31,118
More than those grubby mechanics,
Rearden and my sister.

803
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:35,888
Whatever they do, I can undo
just like that. Just like that!

804
01:01:35,889 --> 01:01:37,457
Like snapping a spine.

805
01:01:37,458 --> 01:01:40,127
- Now you want to break spines?
- Oh, God, I never said that.

806
01:01:40,128 --> 01:01:42,095
You know I never said that.
That's not what I meant.

807
01:01:42,096 --> 01:01:43,596
What is... What's the
matter with you?

808
01:01:43,597 --> 01:01:46,597
<i>- What's the matter with me?
- What's the matter with you?</i>

809
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:56,910
I came to apologize. There's no
reason why you should forgive me.

810
01:01:56,911 --> 01:01:59,712
I just learned the truth
about you and Jim.

811
01:01:59,713 --> 01:02:01,881
I know it's you
who runs the railroad...

812
01:02:01,882 --> 01:02:03,582
and you who built
the John Galt Line.

813
01:02:03,583 --> 01:02:06,319
Can you forgive me?

814
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,922
Of course I forgive you.

815
01:02:08,922 --> 01:02:11,230
<i>Thank you, Dagny.</i>

816
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:19,233
You might want to dial it down
just a little bit.

817
01:02:28,476 --> 01:02:30,977
Mr. Thompson sits between
science and industry.

818
01:02:30,978 --> 01:02:32,215
Dr. Stadler, please.

819
01:02:34,204 --> 01:02:35,982
The chair
on Mr. Thompson's left.

820
01:02:35,983 --> 01:02:39,687
Miss Taggart, to the right.

821
01:02:40,188 --> 01:02:41,187
Showtime.

822
01:02:41,188 --> 01:02:43,032
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

823
01:02:51,032 --> 01:02:53,667
<i>Am I a guest or prisoner?</i>

824
01:02:53,668 --> 01:02:56,102
That choice is yours.

825
01:02:56,103 --> 01:02:57,337
<i>In 10...</i>

826
01:02:57,338 --> 01:02:59,272
<i>Didn't you name
the John Galt Line after me?</i>

827
01:02:59,273 --> 01:03:01,442
<i>But I named it after my enemy.</i>

828
01:03:01,443 --> 01:03:04,143
Well, that's the contradiction that
you're gonna have to figure out.

829
01:03:04,144 --> 01:03:05,946
<i>...four,</i>

830
01:03:05,947 --> 01:03:07,947
-<i> three...</i>
- I won't be a part of this.

831
01:03:07,948 --> 01:03:10,584
You won't?

832
01:03:10,585 --> 01:03:12,986
It's not just for the press, Miss Taggart.
It's for the audience also.

833
01:03:12,987 --> 01:03:15,455
- Dagny, for Christ's sake!
- Cherryl deserved better.

834
01:03:15,456 --> 01:03:18,459
Get her back here! Is anyone with
a brain left in this country?

835
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:22,129
- Dagny!
- Ladies and gentlemen, Head of State Thompson.

836
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:24,832
Good evening,
my fellow Americans.

837
01:03:24,833 --> 01:03:27,039
<i>Tonight, I can't...</i>

838
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:33,874
Ladies and gentlemen,

839
01:03:33,875 --> 01:03:36,377
Mr. Thompson will not
speak to you tonight.

840
01:03:36,378 --> 01:03:38,345
His time is up.

841
01:03:38,346 --> 01:03:41,482
For years, you've asked,
"Who is John Galt?"

842
01:03:41,483 --> 01:03:44,350
You've asked that question
in despair and resignation...

843
01:03:44,351 --> 01:03:47,741
as factories closed,
goods became scarce,

844
01:03:48,021 --> 01:03:50,290
jobs disappeared.

845
01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:52,625
Your lives are becoming
more difficult...

846
01:03:52,626 --> 01:03:56,430
as the life force of your world
is draining away.

847
01:03:56,431 --> 01:04:00,767
You have asked that question
without expecting an answer.

848
01:04:00,768 --> 01:04:02,535
I'm here to answer it.

849
01:04:02,536 --> 01:04:05,641
This is John Galt speaking.

850
01:04:07,241 --> 01:04:10,410
<i>Mr. Thompson won't tell you the truth
about the crisis in your world.</i>

851
01:04:10,411 --> 01:04:12,379
<i>I will.</i>

852
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:15,549
<i>Have you noticed that as everything
around you seems to decline,</i>

853
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:17,984
<i>one thing still grows?</i>

854
01:04:17,985 --> 01:04:20,419
<i>It is the power of your rulers.</i>

855
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:22,555
<i>None of their plans
and directives...</i>

856
01:04:22,556 --> 01:04:26,392
<i>have solved your problems
or made your life better.</i>

857
01:04:26,393 --> 01:04:29,296
<i>The only result has been their
increased control over you...</i>

858
01:04:29,297 --> 01:04:32,399
at the cost of your freedom.

859
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,899
Do you know why?

860
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:36,870
<i>You gave them the power.</i>

861
01:04:36,871 --> 01:04:39,339
<i>They called for your sacrifice,</i>

862
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:41,774
<i>and you thought it was noble.</i>

863
01:04:41,775 --> 01:04:45,346
<i>They said if you worked
for yourself and your family,</i>

864
01:04:45,347 --> 01:04:48,448
<i>that you were selfish
and uncaring.</i>

865
01:04:48,449 --> 01:04:50,951
And they made you feel ashamed.

866
01:04:50,952 --> 01:04:54,488
They denounced the leaders of
industry as greedy exploiters...

867
01:04:54,489 --> 01:04:56,934
The Ellis Wyatts,
the Hank Reardens.

868
01:04:57,057 --> 01:05:00,160
And again, you agreed.

869
01:05:00,161 --> 01:05:01,928
And then you ask,

870
01:05:01,929 --> 01:05:05,799
"Why did they and others
like them disappear?"

871
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,535
I took them from you.

872
01:05:08,536 --> 01:05:11,971
<i>Their achievements flowed
from their creative minds.</i>

873
01:05:11,972 --> 01:05:15,676
<i>Once they understood that the
attempt to control their work...</i>

874
01:05:15,677 --> 01:05:18,678
<i>was an attempt
to control their minds,</i>

875
01:05:18,679 --> 01:05:20,480
<i>they left.</i>

876
01:05:20,481 --> 01:05:23,515
<i>The people on strike
worked for themselves,</i>

877
01:05:23,516 --> 01:05:26,153
<i>for their own vision
of what was possible.</i>

878
01:05:26,154 --> 01:05:28,589
<i>When they recognized
the honor they deserved,</i>

879
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:33,158
<i>they rebelled against the guilt you
wanted them to feel for their success.</i>

880
01:05:33,159 --> 01:05:35,495
You counted on them
to keep producing,

881
01:05:35,496 --> 01:05:37,263
to keep thinking...

882
01:05:37,264 --> 01:05:40,332
Even as you denounced them
as selfish.

883
01:05:40,333 --> 01:05:45,205
<i>I showed them they were being
punished for their own virtues,</i>

884
01:05:45,206 --> 01:05:48,241
and I showed them
how evil that is.

885
01:05:48,242 --> 01:05:51,710
I made it my mission
to help these heroes say no.

886
01:05:51,711 --> 01:05:53,747
All evil needs to win...

887
01:05:53,748 --> 01:05:56,482
<i>is the consent of good people.</i>

888
01:05:56,483 --> 01:05:59,419
<i>They have joined me
to freely produce,</i>

889
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:02,087
<i>trade, cooperate
and compete in a place...</i>

890
01:06:02,088 --> 01:06:04,924
where the rights of all
are protected.

891
01:06:04,925 --> 01:06:07,227
Do not try to find us.

892
01:06:07,228 --> 01:06:10,629
Do not try to bargain
for our return.

893
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:12,333
Get out of our way.

894
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:15,904
<i>To everyone within
the range of my voice,</i>

895
01:06:16,904 --> 01:06:19,272
you now have a choice to make.

896
01:06:19,273 --> 01:06:23,776
<i>If you decide to support the notion
of sacrifice enforced by the State,</i>

897
01:06:23,777 --> 01:06:25,414
<i>your game is up.</i>

898
01:06:26,414 --> 01:06:28,515
<i>Your world
is in a downward spiral,</i>

899
01:06:28,516 --> 01:06:31,186
<i>and you will ride it down
to destruction.</i>

900
01:06:31,943 --> 01:06:34,221
But if you share
the values of our strike,

901
01:06:34,222 --> 01:06:37,659
if you believe that your life
is a sacred possession...

902
01:06:38,659 --> 01:06:40,928
<i>for you to make the most of,</i>

903
01:06:40,929 --> 01:06:44,129
<i>if you want to live by the
judgment of your own mind,</i>

904
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:46,799
not edicts from the State,

905
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,003
then follow our lead.

906
01:06:49,003 --> 01:06:51,337
Do not support
your own oppressors.

907
01:06:51,338 --> 01:06:54,741
Stop letting the system
exploit you.

908
01:06:54,742 --> 01:06:59,245
<i>Form your own communities on the
frontiers of your crumbling world.</i>

909
01:06:59,246 --> 01:07:01,948
<i>Your rulers hold you
by your endurance...</i>

910
01:07:01,949 --> 01:07:04,218
<i>to carry the burdens
they impose,</i>

911
01:07:04,219 --> 01:07:07,187
<i>by your generosity
when you hear cries of despair,</i>

912
01:07:07,188 --> 01:07:09,288
<i>and above all,
by your innocence,</i>

913
01:07:09,289 --> 01:07:13,292
<i>which cannot grasp
the depths of their evil.</i>

914
01:07:13,293 --> 01:07:15,830
<i>The world you are living in
is the world they wanted.</i>

915
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:17,730
<i>Leave them to it.</i>

916
01:07:17,731 --> 01:07:20,567
<i>Those who have left you are
eager to build a better world,</i>

917
01:07:20,568 --> 01:07:22,901
<i>a world of freedom
and opportunity,</i>

918
01:07:22,902 --> 01:07:25,238
a world based on mutual respect.

919
01:07:25,239 --> 01:07:27,374
In that world, you will
rise in the morning...

920
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:29,709
with the spirit
you knew in childhood...

921
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:32,212
The spirit of eagerness
and adventure...

922
01:07:32,213 --> 01:07:34,580
and the confidence that
the world is what it is...

923
01:07:34,581 --> 01:07:36,549
and is there
for you to discover.

924
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:39,919
In that world, you will
not receive alms, nor pity,

925
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,988
nor forgiveness of sins,

926
01:07:41,989 --> 01:07:45,259
but honor, respect and justice.

927
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:49,162
Don't let the fire go out,
spark by irreplaceable spark,

928
01:07:49,163 --> 01:07:51,732
in confusion and despair.

929
01:07:51,733 --> 01:07:53,566
Be sure of your path.

930
01:07:53,567 --> 01:07:56,169
The world you desire can be won.

931
01:07:56,170 --> 01:08:00,073
It exists. It is real.
It is possible.

932
01:08:00,074 --> 01:08:02,341
It is yours.

933
01:08:02,342 --> 01:08:04,710
Come on, let's go.

934
01:08:04,711 --> 01:08:08,749
Did that just happen?
Stop that damned buzzing noise!

935
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:11,350
Go to regular programming.

936
01:08:11,351 --> 01:08:14,587
<i>Finally, somebody has
the courage to tell the truth.</i>

937
01:08:14,588 --> 01:08:16,256
<i>"Be sure of your path."
Is that all you have?</i>

938
01:08:16,257 --> 01:08:19,526
<i>If that speech doesn't do Thompson
in, I don't know what will.</i>

939
01:08:19,527 --> 01:08:23,462
<i>It's not funny. The American
people need government.</i>

940
01:08:23,463 --> 01:08:26,399
<i>And I think that one of the rarest commodities
in this country right now is courage.</i>

941
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,966
<i>I think we saw
a lot of it tonight.</i>

942
01:08:27,967 --> 01:08:31,170
If we didn't cut it off, it'll look
like we authorized that speech.

943
01:08:31,171 --> 01:08:33,840
You damned fool! Would you rather
them think we didn't authorize it?

944
01:08:33,841 --> 01:08:37,176
- Muzzle those commentators!
- Look. Galt is one man.

945
01:08:37,177 --> 01:08:40,112
I don't know who the hell he thinks he is,
but he needs to be arrested, humiliated!

946
01:08:40,113 --> 01:08:41,850
- Oh, the public's not gonna believe that!
- No, no, no, no.

947
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:44,283
That speech was way over their heads.
You know what?

948
01:08:44,284 --> 01:08:46,952
Galt was right about one thing. The
public can't think for themselves.

949
01:08:46,953 --> 01:08:48,889
They have to be controlled.

950
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:50,556
What do you propose
we do, Floyd?

951
01:08:50,557 --> 01:08:53,626
He just gave you the answers.

952
01:08:53,627 --> 01:08:56,864
- What more do you need to know?
- Dagny, I'll make him a deal.

953
01:08:57,064 --> 01:08:59,534
Good night, gentlemen.

954
01:09:00,267 --> 01:09:02,434
Dagny, thank you
for speaking your mind.

955
01:09:02,435 --> 01:09:04,504
I just want you to know
that you can trust us.

956
01:09:04,505 --> 01:09:06,339
We're not your enemies.

957
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:08,442
We've made mistakes.
We're only human!

958
01:09:08,443 --> 01:09:10,376
Find him, and then
we'll make him a deal.

959
01:09:10,377 --> 01:09:12,379
I don't think he's someone
who's open to a deal.

960
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:14,147
You just be careful
with this, okay?

961
01:09:14,148 --> 01:09:15,549
Everyone's open
to cutting a deal.

962
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:17,950
She's one of them.

963
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:21,688
Just watch her. I think she
may be able to help us, huh?

964
01:09:21,689 --> 01:09:23,590
You got it.

965
01:09:23,591 --> 01:09:26,369
<i>Mr. Thompson stated,
"There is no cause for alarm."</i>

966
01:09:27,027 --> 01:09:30,264
<i>He urges the public not to draw
any uninformed conclusions,</i>

967
01:09:30,265 --> 01:09:33,399
<i>to preserve a sense of broad-minded
tolerance and discipline.</i>

968
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:37,737
<i>Says Thompson, "We must regard it as
one viewpoint in our forum of opinion.</i>

969
01:09:37,738 --> 01:09:41,734
<i>The truth has many facets.
We must remain impartial."</i>

970
01:09:42,009 --> 01:09:45,578
No. No.

971
01:09:45,579 --> 01:09:47,313
- We want Galt!
- Yeah!

972
01:09:47,314 --> 01:09:49,016
- We want Galt!
- We want Galt!

973
01:09:50,016 --> 01:10:01,094
We want Galt!
We want Galt!

974
01:10:01,095 --> 01:10:02,095
We want Galt!

975
01:10:03,029 --> 01:10:06,566
<i>We heard it on the streets.
We heard it online.</i>

976
01:10:06,567 --> 01:10:09,068
<i>We heard it everywhere.</i>

977
01:10:09,069 --> 01:10:11,470
<i>The people wanted Galt.</i>

978
01:10:11,471 --> 01:10:13,172
<i>Who's John Galt?</i>

979
01:10:13,173 --> 01:10:16,173
<i>I am John Galt.
I am John Galt.</i>

980
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:18,211
<i>I am John Galt!</i>

981
01:10:18,212 --> 01:10:21,247
<i>Oh, my.
Are Thompson's days numbered.</i>

982
01:10:21,248 --> 01:10:23,316
<i>Who is John Galt?</i>

983
01:10:23,317 --> 01:10:25,786
<i>I have to tell you,
as I'm watching this myself,</i>

984
01:10:25,787 --> 01:10:29,488
<i>I'm thinking,
"Scream it! Shout it!"</i>

985
01:10:29,489 --> 01:10:32,758
<i>But that would be the way I would
do it... in exactly the wrong way.</i>

986
01:10:32,759 --> 01:10:35,661
<i>Because nobody would hear it,
and he'd look like a mad man.</i>

987
01:10:35,662 --> 01:10:37,930
<i>Finally,
somebody says the truth...</i>

988
01:10:37,931 --> 01:10:40,968
<i>and says it the way
it was supposed to be said.</i>

989
01:10:40,969 --> 01:10:46,639
<i>Power comes from the vision,
not the volume.</i>

990
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,241
<i>We want Galt!</i>

991
01:10:48,242 --> 01:10:50,210
I want it stopped.

992
01:10:50,211 --> 01:10:52,578
<i>We want Galt!
We want Galt!</i>

993
01:10:52,579 --> 01:10:55,317
Bring me Dagny Taggart.

994
01:10:56,317 --> 01:10:58,622
<i>We want Galt!
We want Galt!</i>

995
01:11:02,622 --> 01:11:04,790
He doesn't need
to commit to anything.

996
01:11:04,791 --> 01:11:08,127
I just need him to know that
I'm ready to meet his terms,

997
01:11:08,128 --> 01:11:09,629
whatever they are.

998
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:12,264
I really can't help you.

999
01:11:12,265 --> 01:11:16,368
We have tried,
but we cannot find Mr. Galt.

1000
01:11:16,369 --> 01:11:17,970
Now, we've placed...

1001
01:11:17,971 --> 01:11:21,374
What Mr. Thompson means to
say is, we hope he's alive.

1002
01:11:21,375 --> 01:11:23,643
Miss Taggart,
I am a peaceful man.

1003
01:11:23,644 --> 01:11:25,812
I simply want to help him.

1004
01:11:25,813 --> 01:11:29,549
What if someone not as amiable as Mr.
Thompson...

1005
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:32,251
was to locate him before we did?

1006
01:11:32,252 --> 01:11:34,219
I'd just hate to think...

1007
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:37,389
Now, Floyd.

1008
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:40,264
We're also offering
a substantial reward.

1009
01:11:44,264 --> 01:11:46,335
I wouldn't know how to help you.

1010
01:11:53,407 --> 01:11:55,774
<i>Think she's lying?</i>

1011
01:11:55,775 --> 01:11:57,944
She knows where he is.

1012
01:12:00,614 --> 01:12:02,715
We want Galt!
We want Galt!

1013
01:12:02,716 --> 01:12:04,783
<i>John Galt represents today...</i>

1014
01:12:04,784 --> 01:12:06,818
<i>the sentiment of millions
and millions of people...</i>

1015
01:12:06,819 --> 01:12:09,354
<i>who are sick and tired
of the endless wars,</i>

1016
01:12:09,355 --> 01:12:11,358
<i>the attacks
on our civil liberties,</i>

1017
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:13,393
<i>the abuse of what's happening
in the economy,</i>

1018
01:12:13,394 --> 01:12:15,260
<i>the poverty that is coming.</i>

1019
01:12:15,261 --> 01:12:18,430
<i>And those are the people who are
speaking out, and they needed a voice.</i>

1020
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:20,645
<i>John Galt, in many ways,
is that voice.</i>

1021
01:13:15,721 --> 01:13:17,490
Hey!

1022
01:13:50,490 --> 01:13:52,379
I was so afraid.
I had to warn you.

1023
01:13:52,927 --> 01:13:55,594
You don't need to explain,
but you were followed.

1024
01:13:55,595 --> 01:13:57,362
I don't think so.
I made sure...

1025
01:13:57,363 --> 01:14:00,066
You know, one thing they're good at is
snooping. They'll be here any minute.

1026
01:14:00,067 --> 01:14:02,203
- Then let's get out of here right now.
- No. No.

1027
01:14:02,403 --> 01:14:06,171
From now on, you have to make them
think that you are on their side,

1028
01:14:06,172 --> 01:14:07,674
- that I'm your enemy.
- What?

1029
01:14:07,675 --> 01:14:10,175
If you do, I have
a chance to survive this.

1030
01:14:10,176 --> 01:14:14,145
They need me alive, but they wouldn't
think twice about hurting you or worse.

1031
01:14:14,146 --> 01:14:16,148
And I couldn't stand that.

1032
01:14:16,149 --> 01:14:19,751
If I hear of it, I will kill
myself and stop them right there.

1033
01:14:19,752 --> 01:14:23,089
Convince them that you hate me.

1034
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:26,090
You must. Do you understand?

1035
01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:27,491
I do.

1036
01:14:34,067 --> 01:14:37,571
So you lived here, all
these years, like this?

1037
01:14:37,572 --> 01:14:40,143
Well,

1038
01:14:42,143 --> 01:14:43,445
more like this.

1039
01:14:45,445 --> 01:14:48,081
The motor!

1040
01:14:48,082 --> 01:14:51,082
- We have to hide it.
- It's all right.

1041
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,653
Mr. Galt!
Open up, sir.

1042
01:14:54,654 --> 01:14:57,756
All right. Don't be afraid.
Okay?

1043
01:14:57,757 --> 01:14:59,064
It's okay.

1044
01:15:03,064 --> 01:15:04,064
Mr. Galt!

1045
01:15:07,857 --> 01:15:10,135
- That's him. That's John Galt.
- Get out!

1046
01:15:10,136 --> 01:15:13,306
Stay where you are, sir. Ma'am,
I need you to back up, please.

1047
01:15:13,506 --> 01:15:15,441
Right there.

1048
01:15:15,442 --> 01:15:17,165
We need to see some ID, please.

1049
01:15:18,045 --> 01:15:20,145
I'm Dagny Taggart.
He's the one.

1050
01:15:20,146 --> 01:15:22,146
- Both of you, please.
- He's the one we've been looking for.

1051
01:15:22,149 --> 01:15:24,416
Mr. Thompson is waiting
to speak with him in person.

1052
01:15:24,417 --> 01:15:27,855
Tell you what. I'll cooperate if
you get this woman away from me.

1053
01:15:28,055 --> 01:15:30,444
-<i> Is that room clear?</i>
- Miss Taggart, thank you.

1054
01:15:30,644 --> 01:15:32,791
You can step outside.
We'll handle things from here.

1055
01:15:32,792 --> 01:15:35,161
I'll be expecting my reward.

1056
01:15:35,162 --> 01:15:38,774
Miss Taggart, Mr. Thompson will be
very grateful for your efforts.

1057
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:44,470
Mr. Galt.

1058
01:15:46,206 --> 01:15:48,177
It's an honor, sir.

1059
01:15:51,177 --> 01:15:52,944
What are you looking for?

1060
01:15:52,945 --> 01:15:56,581
Just to be certain that you're out of
danger, sir. The men'll just be a moment.

1061
01:15:56,582 --> 01:15:58,451
- Am I under arrest?
- No, sir.

1062
01:15:58,452 --> 01:16:01,086
Our orders are to escort you
safely to Head of State Thompson,

1063
01:16:01,087 --> 01:16:03,092
where your presence is needed.

1064
01:16:06,092 --> 01:16:08,193
- It won't open.
- Mr. Galt, sir?

1065
01:16:08,194 --> 01:16:10,530
-<i> It's locked.</i> - Would you
 mind unlocking that door, please?

1066
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:14,134
- There's no key.
- Sir, I have orders to search the entire apartment.

1067
01:16:14,135 --> 01:16:16,580
- It would be helpful if...
- Go right ahead.

1068
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:31,216
No amount of force will grant
you access to that motor.

1069
01:16:31,217 --> 01:16:32,751
Allow me.

1070
01:16:32,752 --> 01:16:35,787
"I swear by my life
and my love of it...

1071
01:16:35,788 --> 01:16:37,822
that I will never live
for the sake of another man...

1072
01:16:37,823 --> 01:16:40,463
nor ask another man
to live for mine."

1073
01:16:43,463 --> 01:16:45,734
We got nothing.

1074
01:16:47,734 --> 01:16:49,743
We need to go.

1075
01:16:56,743 --> 01:17:07,186
We want Galt!
We want Galt!

1076
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:12,340
- Hello?
-<i> Well, well.</i>

1077
01:17:12,626 --> 01:17:15,626
- John? -<i> So you're the young
fella that started all this.</i>

1078
01:17: 15,729 --> 01:17:18,364
I'm tickled pink to meet ya.
Just tickled pink.

1079
01:17:18,365 --> 01:17:20,365
- I'm Thompson.
- How do you do?

1080
01:17:20,634 --> 01:17:24,039
Make yourself comfortable.
You're... You're an important man.

1081
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:30,845
Yeah, that was
some speech you made.

1082
01:17:31,845 --> 01:17:34,580
You've done something
to this country.

1083
01:17:34,581 --> 01:17:36,381
I don't know what or why.

1084
01:17:36,382 --> 01:17:40,055
But... people seem to want
what it is you sell.

1085
01:17:41,912 --> 01:17:44,357
Now, I may not agree
with everything you say,

1086
01:17:44,358 --> 01:17:47,292
but I'm always willing
to change my mind.

1087
01:17:47,293 --> 01:17:51,571
Now, you don't... you don't expect us to
agree with everything you say, do ya?

1088
01:17:52,097 --> 01:17:54,599
No. Yeah.
You want something to drink?

1089
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:57,469
Get him something to drink.

1090
01:17:57,470 --> 01:18:00,637
Well, the world's in a hell of
a mess, just like you said.

1091
01:18:01,007 --> 01:18:03,211
On that, I do agree with you.

1092
01:18:04,211 --> 01:18:05,934
Sit down there, Floyd.
Sit down.

1093
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:10,354
Thank you.

1094
01:18:14,354 --> 01:18:15,457
So...

1095
01:18:17,457 --> 01:18:19,625
what do you have to say?

1096
01:18:19,626 --> 01:18:21,229
Nothing.

1097
01:18:22,229 --> 01:18:23,229
Nothing?

1098
01:18:25,164 --> 01:18:27,599
I didn't ask to speak with you.

1099
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,702
Yeah, but we have
a lot to discuss.

1100
01:18:30,703 --> 01:18:33,605
<i>Now...</i>

1101
01:18:33,606 --> 01:18:35,375
<i>I'm offering you a deal.</i>

1102
01:18:35,376 --> 01:18:37,447
Ah, well...

1103
01:18:40,403 --> 01:18:42,297
I'm always open to a deal.

1104
01:18:42,298 --> 01:18:45,251
Haha, I knew it!
I knew it!

1105
01:18:45,252 --> 01:18:47,752
I told those theorizers of mine.

1106
01:18:47,753 --> 01:18:52,425
I'm always open to a deal with
anyone who has a value to offer me.

1107
01:18:52,426 --> 01:18:55,260
Well, then, hell,
write your own ticket.

1108
01:18:55,261 --> 01:18:56,861
- What are you offering?
- Anything you want.

1109
01:18:56,997 --> 01:18:59,997
- Such as?
- Well, your terms, of course.

1110
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,068
Lookit...
Listen, I am certain...

1111
01:19:03,069 --> 01:19:07,172
that you are a man
that can make things work?

1112
01:19:07,173 --> 01:19:11,911
I'm ready to give in. I'm... I
am willing to amend the system.

1113
01:19:11,912 --> 01:19:14,248
I told you what to do.

1114
01:19:15,248 --> 01:19:16,519
What?

1115
01:19:19,519 --> 01:19:22,330
Get out of the way.

1116
01:19:22,956 --> 01:19:24,256
Wait a second.

1117
01:19:24,257 --> 01:19:26,791
Now, now, now,
I said "amend."

1118
01:19:26,792 --> 01:19:28,570
I didn't say "abandon."

1119
01:19:31,053 --> 01:19:32,831
That's just out of the question.

1120
01:19:32,832 --> 01:19:35,438
You see,

1121
01:19:38,438 --> 01:19:41,907
I am offering you
Wesley Mouch's job.

1122
01:19:41,908 --> 01:19:43,675
Huh?

1123
01:19:43,676 --> 01:19:45,678
Now, there's nothing
bigger than that.

1124
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:47,513
You're free to do
anything at all.

1125
01:19:48,015 --> 01:19:50,549
You don't like regulations?
Well, repeal 'em.

1126
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:53,606
You... You want higher profits,
lower wages? Decree 'em.

1127
01:19:54,289 --> 01:19:56,456
You want special privileges?
Grant them.

1128
01:19:56,457 --> 01:19:59,191
You don't like the unions?
Dissolve 'em.

1129
01:19:59,192 --> 01:20:01,126
You play it any way you want,

1130
01:20:01,127 --> 01:20:03,362
but... just think about it.

1131
01:20:03,363 --> 01:20:07,800
<i>In Washington, everyone's gonna
want to be your best friend.</i>

1132
01:20:07,801 --> 01:20:09,137
Oh.

1133
01:20:11,137 --> 01:20:14,173
You're gonna have power!

1134
01:20:30,548 --> 01:20:34,160
Wait. Now, what? What? I'm offering
you the best job in the world.

1135
01:20:34,161 --> 01:20:35,961
What is...
What is wrong with that?

1136
01:20:35,962 --> 01:20:39,266
But that kind of job
shouldn't exist.

1137
01:20:41,421 --> 01:20:44,340
No one should have
that kind of power.

1138
01:20:54,715 --> 01:20:57,956
I can't figure you out.

1139
01:21:02,956 --> 01:21:04,456
Get him out of here.

1140
01:21:04,457 --> 01:21:07,559
And take that idiot
Taggart with you.

1141
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,400
<i>- SSI?
- Yes.</i>

1142
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,067
<i>We want Galt!
We want Galt!</i>

1143
01:21:47,067 --> 01:21:48,645
Get him out!

1144
01:21:58,645 --> 01:22:01,613
<i>Once standing as a monument
to American individualism,</i>

1145
01:22:01,614 --> 01:22:05,654
<i>the Taggart Bridge had finally
surrendered to regulation.</i>

1146
01:22:16,563 --> 01:22:19,398
Dagny! Oh.

1147
01:22:19,399 --> 01:22:22,634
Did you hear? The Taggart
Bridge collapsed.

1148
01:22:22,635 --> 01:22:25,938
Listen, Frisco, I'm ready.

1149
01:22:25,939 --> 01:22:28,139
"I swear by my life
and my love of it...

1150
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:30,908
that I will never live
for the sake of another man...

1151
01:22:30,909 --> 01:22:34,212
nor ask another man
to live for mine."

1152
01:22:34,213 --> 01:22:36,250
Let's go, slugger.

1153
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:39,757
Ragnar has his helicopter
standing by.

1154
01:22:44,757 --> 01:22:46,532
Secure him there.

1155
01:22:51,532 --> 01:22:54,966
Project F?

1156
01:22:54,967 --> 01:22:57,137
What the hell are we doing here?

1157
01:22:58,137 --> 01:22:59,693
This was never my intention.

1158
01:23:00,039 --> 01:23:02,744
John, this is not my fault!

1159
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:08,546
You might want to leave, Jimmy boy.
This is gonna get ugly.

1160
01:23:08,547 --> 01:23:12,184
No. I want to be here. I wanna... I
wanna see this. I wanna see him break.

1161
01:23:12,185 --> 01:23:14,997
Okay. Your choice.

1162
01:23:23,997 --> 01:23:27,975
Cuffy? Stand by
to initialize power.

1163
01:23:36,743 --> 01:23:40,813
Get this straight.
You are going to help us.

1164
01:23:40,814 --> 01:23:43,314
Agree, and all this goes away.

1165
01:23:43,315 --> 01:23:46,057
You understand?

1166
01:23:51,057 --> 01:23:52,724
Suit yourself, genius.

1167
01:23:52,725 --> 01:23:56,094
Of all people, not him!
I want no part of this.

1168
01:23:56,095 --> 01:23:58,865
Then get out of here before I
make you trade places with him.

1169
01:23:59,065 --> 01:24:01,078
Go on, go!

1170
01:24:35,569 --> 01:24:37,975
Again.

1171
01:24:42,975 --> 01:24:45,777
I'm here on behalf
of Mr. Thompson.

1172
01:24:45,778 --> 01:24:48,179
You wouldn't disobey an order
from Mr. Thompson, would you?

1173
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:50,681
No. You're...
You're Dagny Taggart.

1174
01:24:50,682 --> 01:24:53,218
Then on direct order
from Mr. Thompson,

1175
01:24:53,219 --> 01:24:54,952
you are to let me in
immediately.

1176
01:24:54,953 --> 01:24:57,857
No. Dr. Ferris said I wasn't
supposed to let just anyone in.

1177
01:24:57,858 --> 01:25:00,459
- Whoa, whoa!
- You need to make a decision.

1178
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:03,694
Listen to me very carefully.
This is about your life.

1179
01:25:03,695 --> 01:25:07,832
<i>If you die, you won't know
what you're dying for.</i>

1180
01:25:07,833 --> 01:25:10,435
<i>If I die, I will.</i>

1181
01:25:10,436 --> 01:25:14,639
Either you let me in,
or I shoot.

1182
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:17,108
- Now decide.
- I'm not supposed to decide.

1183
01:25:17,109 --> 01:25:18,578
- I'm just an average guy.
- One...

1184
01:25:18,778 --> 01:25:20,812
I'm not supposed to make
decisions about my life.

1185
01:25:20,813 --> 01:25:23,482
- Two...
- I haven't said I won't. I haven't said I will.

1186
01:25:23,483 --> 01:25:25,493
- Three!
- I'm only following orders!

1187
01:25:34,493 --> 01:25:36,063
Make sure it's okay in here.

1188
01:25:37,063 --> 01:25:39,063
All right.
Let's go. Let's go.

1189
01:25:41,001 --> 01:25:43,535
Had enough?

1190
01:25:43,536 --> 01:25:48,506
I understand you're some kind
of electrical engineer.

1191
01:25:48,507 --> 01:25:52,012
So tell me, Mr. Galt,
in your expert opinion,

1192
01:25:54,012 --> 01:25:55,784
how we doing?

1193
01:26:00,034 --> 01:26:00,817
Again.

1194
01:26:14,917 --> 01:26:15,648
Again.
 
1195
01:26:29,148 --> 01:26:31,750
I think Project F likes you.

1196
01:26:32,251 --> 01:26:33,251
Again.

1197
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:34,457
Okay.

1198
01:26:37,957 --> 01:26:38,959
Do it.

1199
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:41,493
Do it!

1200
01:26:42,494 --> 01:26:45,229
- What's the matter?
- What's the problem?

1201
01:26:45,230 --> 01:26:46,997
- What?
- How the hell would I know?

1202
01:26:46,998 --> 01:26:50,667
- Well, find someone who does!
- Hey, watch your tone.

1203
01:26:50,968 --> 01:26:51,904
<i>Come on.</i>

1204
01:26:52,405 --> 01:26:55,674
Replace the fuse,
and the machine will work.

1205
01:26:55,675 --> 01:26:59,413
This is ridiculous!
I won't have it!

1206
01:27:00,413 --> 01:27:02,413
I won't have it!

1207
01:27:02,414 --> 01:27:04,450
- Do it! Do it! - Hey, hey.
- Jimmy, calm down!

1208
01:27:04,650 --> 01:27:07,255
Jimmy...
Come on. Come on!

1209
01:27:09,255 --> 01:27:12,128
We'll be back,
you son of a bitch!

1210
01:27:32,679 --> 01:27:34,479
John! John!

1211
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:37,181
John! John.
Damn it! Damn it!

1212
01:27:37,182 --> 01:27:39,020
I swear by my life!

1213
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:42,121
John, come back to me!

1214
01:27:42,122 --> 01:27:43,122
Come back!

1215
01:27:45,024 --> 01:27:46,061
John!

1216
01:27:49,061 --> 01:27:50,629
Damn it!

1217
01:27:50,630 --> 01:27:53,502
Damn it.
You're... You're alive!

1218
01:27:55,502 --> 01:27:58,312
Thank goodness.

1219
01:27:58,438 --> 01:28:00,438
- You're here!
- I'm back. I'm back.

1220
01:28:00,672 --> 01:28:02,640
- I love you.
- I'm okay.

1221
01:28:02,641 --> 01:28:05,277
- John.
- Hold him, hold him, hold him.

1222
01:28:05,278 --> 01:28:08,246
Okay. I got him.
I got him.

1223
01:28:08,247 --> 01:28:11,619
Give me your arm. Give me your arm, John.
Go ahead. I got it.

1224
01:28:13,619 --> 01:28:16,371
We got ya. We got ya, John.
We got ya.

1225
01:28:16,372 --> 01:28:17,976
We got ya.

1226
01:28:36,976 --> 01:28:39,747
We're almost there.
We're almost there.

1227
01:28:40,747 --> 01:28:43,822
Come on.
We're almost there.

1228
01:28:48,822 --> 01:28:50,878
- Okay, careful. Careful.
- Hang in there.

1229
01:28:58,465 --> 01:29:01,465
- I got the door.
- Grab my hand.

1230
01:29:02,301 --> 01:29:03,935
Get in! Get in!

1231
01:29:03,936 --> 01:29:06,604
Midas is waiting on the other side
of the trees. Don't worry about it.

1232
01:29:06,605 --> 01:29:09,174
We've got one more man to pick up.
We'll see you soon.

1233
01:29:09,175 --> 01:29:11,175
- Eddie.
- Thank you.

1234
01:29:11,177 --> 01:29:13,372
Let's go.

1235
01:29:39,372 --> 01:29:42,072
<i>Chopper 2.
We are airborne.</i>

1236
01:29:42,073 --> 01:29:44,779
<i>You're cleared
to head back to Atlantis.</i>

1237
01:29:45,779 --> 01:29:47,711
<i>Dr. Hendricks
is standing by.</i>

1238
01:29:47,712 --> 01:29:49,715
<i>Tell John he's in good hands.</i>

1239
01:29:49,716 --> 01:29:51,582
Just lie still.
Lie still.

1240
01:29:51,583 --> 01:29:54,583
- Who's Ragnar talking to?
- Midas.

1241
01:29:54,654 --> 01:29:57,855
He's flying
the other helicopter.

1242
01:29:57,856 --> 01:30:00,658
We tried. We couldn't stop him
and the others from coming.

1243
01:30:00,659 --> 01:30:03,394
Don't worry, John.
We've got your back.

1244
01:30:03,395 --> 01:30:05,264
Good.

1245
01:30:06,265 --> 01:30:07,400
Yeah.

1246
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,135
Escaped?
What do you mean?

1247
01:30:11,136 --> 01:30:14,072
What?
Wh-Where's Ferris?

1248
01:30:14,073 --> 01:30:16,976
What do you mean, tied up?

1249
01:30:17,976 --> 01:30:19,779
Hello? Hello?!

1250
01:30:21,913 --> 01:30:24,320
What the hell is happening?!

1251
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:29,858
John.

1252
01:30:31,858 --> 01:30:35,131
I need you to know,
I never wanted to leave you.

1253
01:30:38,631 --> 01:30:40,215
You're my forever.

1254
01:30:56,715 --> 01:30:57,912
It's the end.

1255
01:31:01,787 --> 01:31:03,590
No.

1256
01:31:04,590 --> 01:31:06,152
It's the beginning.

1257
01:31:32,152 --> 01:31:34,752
<i>In the name
of the best within you,</i>

1258
01:31:34,753 --> 01:31:37,488
<i>do not sacrifice your sense
of life to an enemy...</i>

1259
01:31:37,489 --> 01:31:39,357
<i>that would claim
your precious mind.</i>

1260
01:31:39,358 --> 01:31:43,562
<i>Do not let your fire go out,
spark by irreplaceable spark.</i>

1261
01:31:43,563 --> 01:31:47,532
<i>Do not let the hero in your soul
perish in lonely frustration...</i>

1262
01:31:47,533 --> 01:31:52,336
<i>for the life you deserve, but
have never been able to reach.</i>

1263
01:31:52,337 --> 01:31:55,473
<i>The world you desire can be won.</i>

1264
01:31:55,474 --> 01:32:00,478
<i>It exists. It is real.
It is possible.</i>

1265
01:32:00,479 --> 01:32:02,615
<i>It is yours.</i>

1266
01:32:03,615 --> 01:32:05,608
<i>This is John Galt speaking.</i>
