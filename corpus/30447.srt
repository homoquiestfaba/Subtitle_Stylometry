1
00:00:35,115 --> 00:00:36,628
I don't really pray...

2
00:00:36,915 --> 00:00:39,713
...but if you could just
help me out here...

3
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:41,184
...I promise....

4
00:00:44,235 --> 00:00:45,748
105.

5
00:00:46,395 --> 00:00:47,669
105?

6
00:00:47,995 --> 00:00:49,030
Oh, my God!

7
00:00:50,035 --> 00:00:51,627
Run a bath, call the doctor.

8
00:00:51,915 --> 00:00:53,826
Get her into the bath.

9
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:56,385
Dr. Carter, 655-....

10
00:00:56,635 --> 00:00:57,704
He won't be there.

11
00:00:58,195 --> 00:00:59,708
What is a thermometer?
Mercury.

12
00:01:00,555 --> 00:01:03,308
How does it even work?
Maybe I can page him.

13
00:01:03,555 --> 00:01:05,466
Susan. Susie.

14
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,103
Mommy says get up now.

15
00:01:08,475 --> 00:01:10,033
-Cold.
-I know.

16
00:01:11,195 --> 00:01:12,105
Hang on.

17
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:15,351
Cold!

18
00:01:15,595 --> 00:01:18,109
It just feels cold because you're so hot.

19
00:01:18,915 --> 00:01:20,507
Susan, stay with me. Susan.

20
00:01:21,595 --> 00:01:22,584
Susan!

21
00:01:25,755 --> 00:01:27,473
Has she been disoriented?
Confused?

22
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:30,594
She said that she saw
a man in her bedroom.

23
00:01:34,555 --> 00:01:35,431
Are you cold?

24
00:01:38,675 --> 00:01:39,505
Okay, swing it.

25
00:01:40,635 --> 00:01:42,353
-Move it, people.
-Is room 2 clear?

26
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:43,784
Yes, it's clear.

27
00:01:44,315 --> 00:01:45,464
Get her pressure.

28
00:01:45,795 --> 00:01:47,672
Let's give her O2. Ten liters.

29
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:49,867
Tap her right away.

30
00:01:57,555 --> 00:01:58,908
How's her breathing?

31
00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:22,428
No pulse or rhythm.

32
00:02:23,715 --> 00:02:25,307
Are you God?

33
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:27,990
No.

34
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:29,714
My name is Seth.

35
00:02:30,195 --> 00:02:31,423
Where are we going?

36
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:32,670
Home.

37
00:02:34,315 --> 00:02:35,589
Can Mommy come?

38
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:37,230
No.

39
00:02:45,555 --> 00:02:47,466
She won't understand.

40
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:49,070
She will...

41
00:02:49,555 --> 00:02:50,829
...someday.

42
00:02:58,475 --> 00:03:00,431
Can I ask you something?

43
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,024
Yes.

44
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:04,466
What did you like best?

45
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,593
Pajamas.

46
00:03:32,635 --> 00:03:34,466
She definitely knew what she liked.

47
00:03:35,475 --> 00:03:38,547
-Pajamas?
-Flannel, with feet.

48
00:03:38,955 --> 00:03:40,183
Pajamas.

49
00:03:41,035 --> 00:03:43,344
Excellent choice. What else?

50
00:03:44,035 --> 00:03:46,390
In the elevator of
the Bradbury Building...

51
00:03:46,635 --> 00:03:49,866
...a man touched a woman's
bare skin by accident...

52
00:03:50,435 --> 00:03:53,313
...but it made her turn
and look at him in such a way....

53
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,314
And they...?

54
00:03:56,755 --> 00:03:57,949
Yes.

55
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:00,668
It was a good day.

56
00:04:01,235 --> 00:04:03,351
Do you ever wonder
what that would be like?

57
00:04:03,915 --> 00:04:04,825
Touch?

58
00:04:05,795 --> 00:04:06,750
No.

59
00:04:07,635 --> 00:04:08,750
Yes, you do.

60
00:04:11,195 --> 00:04:12,913
Occasionally. Yes.

61
00:04:14,435 --> 00:04:15,868
Touch.

62
00:04:33,395 --> 00:04:36,148
I'm not asking for it every night.
Just twice a week.

63
00:04:36,395 --> 00:04:38,989
Blue eyes.
He's never going to leave her.

64
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:42,830
20 minutes. 20 minutes. Everything
in this damn city is 20 minutes.

65
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:44,588
It's never 20 minutes.

66
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:09,104
My ass on a stool all day.
She always gets the good chair.

67
00:05:10,755 --> 00:05:14,748
Six pounds, four ounces.
My daughter has a daughter.

68
00:05:27,115 --> 00:05:29,151
$20,000 at 21 percent.

69
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,228
Pay it off with another card
at 14 percent.

70
00:05:32,595 --> 00:05:33,584
Ah, shit!

71
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:38,067
Federal 595 heavy, slow immediately
to match preceding aircraft. Over.

72
00:05:38,315 --> 00:05:40,192
Jesus, wake up! Wake up!

73
00:05:54,715 --> 00:05:57,229
The little girl asked me
if she could be an angel.

74
00:05:58,235 --> 00:05:59,714
They all want wings.

75
00:06:00,115 --> 00:06:01,787
I never know what to say.

76
00:06:02,315 --> 00:06:03,589
Tell them the truth.

77
00:06:04,355 --> 00:06:05,788
Angels aren't human.

78
00:06:06,315 --> 00:06:07,794
We were never human.

79
00:06:08,515 --> 00:06:11,951
What if I just make her
a little pair of wings out of paper?

80
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:13,788
Tell her the truth.

81
00:06:14,315 --> 00:06:15,714
I told her.

82
00:06:17,915 --> 00:06:19,143
How did she take it?

83
00:06:20,155 --> 00:06:24,114
She said, "What good would wings be
if you couldn't feel wind on your face?"

84
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,226
On the 101 through
downtown L.A., no delays....

85
00:06:53,595 --> 00:06:55,153
Shit! Jesus!

86
00:08:01,435 --> 00:08:02,504
What do we got?

87
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:06,914
50-year-old had a huge anterior wall MI
this morning. Collapsed while jogging.

88
00:08:07,595 --> 00:08:10,155
Paramedics resuscitated him,
but his EKG's pretty ugly.

89
00:08:10,555 --> 00:08:11,829
He's hypertensive.

90
00:08:12,035 --> 00:08:13,309
This diagonal looks tight.

91
00:08:14,275 --> 00:08:15,503
Who cathed him?

92
00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:17,343
Rosenberg.

93
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:20,831
-Be right in.
-The patient wants to meet you.

94
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,711
He's pretty out of it.

95
00:08:37,235 --> 00:08:38,554
The doctor's here.

96
00:09:01,435 --> 00:09:03,346
We're just going to cool to 32 today.

97
00:09:05,235 --> 00:09:06,065
Sucker.

98
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:10,384
Jimi.

99
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:26,825
Vein.

100
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,627
Kid started walking.

101
00:09:43,435 --> 00:09:45,471
Three unassisted steps.

102
00:09:46,035 --> 00:09:48,503
-Get it on video?
-I wasn't even there.

103
00:09:49,635 --> 00:09:52,024
You failed as a father already.
How does that feel?

104
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:56,951
Retrograde on.

105
00:10:01,155 --> 00:10:03,111
Come down to half flow,
give me a little volume.

106
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:04,993
Down to half flow,
here's your volume.

107
00:10:05,235 --> 00:10:06,588
-Ready to come off?
-Ready.

108
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:07,745
Let's come off.

109
00:10:08,115 --> 00:10:09,343
We're coming down.

110
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:12,632
We're clamped and off bypass.

111
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:36,830
Oh, shit.

112
00:10:38,355 --> 00:10:39,470
What are you missing?

113
00:10:39,715 --> 00:10:40,511
Sponge.

114
00:10:41,915 --> 00:10:42,904
Bummer.

115
00:10:48,795 --> 00:10:49,864
Got it!

116
00:10:55,715 --> 00:10:57,068
Thank you, everybody.

117
00:10:57,435 --> 00:10:59,153
Presbyterian's on line 2.

118
00:10:59,515 --> 00:11:00,834
His rhythm will be irritable.

119
00:11:04,475 --> 00:11:07,785
-She's getting good, huh?
-Yeah, she's getting that attitude too.

120
00:11:08,115 --> 00:11:09,707
Getting an attitude?

121
00:11:12,035 --> 00:11:13,354
Shit! V-tac!

122
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:14,989
Christ! Paddles!

123
00:11:15,395 --> 00:11:17,147
Kill the music. Get her back.

124
00:11:17,395 --> 00:11:19,386
-Charge to 2.
-Charging 200.

125
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:21,751
Dr. Rice.

126
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:29,271
Clear!

127
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:31,827
-No pressure.
-You give him lidocaine?

128
00:11:31,995 --> 00:11:32,791
100's gone in.

129
00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:34,314
Buzz him again at 300.

130
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:38,147
-Still nothing.
-Start compression.

131
00:11:38,315 --> 00:11:39,225
Kill the alarm!

132
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:45,468
Hold up. It's not working.

133
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:48,030
Got to open him.
How long to go back on?

134
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:49,674
It'll take me 10 minutes.

135
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:51,468
Come on! Nothing.

136
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:52,671
Knife.

137
00:12:00,795 --> 00:12:02,831
Internal paddles. Charge to 20.

138
00:12:03,555 --> 00:12:04,385
Ready.

139
00:12:04,915 --> 00:12:05,791
Hit it.

140
00:12:08,035 --> 00:12:09,309
Go to 30.

141
00:12:10,155 --> 00:12:10,985
Hit it.

142
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,504
No response.

143
00:12:13,235 --> 00:12:14,873
Tom, I got to get back on bypass here.

144
00:12:15,155 --> 00:12:16,793
Almost there.
Give me 7 more minutes.

145
00:12:17,115 --> 00:12:17,945
Come on.

146
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:21,910
Don't do this.

147
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:24,705
He's going.

148
00:12:25,395 --> 00:12:26,384
He's not going anywhere.

149
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:38,027
Come on, don't do this!

150
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,909
Damn it, come on!

151
00:12:43,955 --> 00:12:44,990
Tom!

152
00:12:46,675 --> 00:12:48,108
Come on!

153
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:11,429
Mrs. Balford?

154
00:13:12,635 --> 00:13:13,829
Where's the doctor?

155
00:13:15,355 --> 00:13:17,391
-I'm the doctor.
-I'm sorry.

156
00:13:19,355 --> 00:13:20,583
I operated on your husband.

157
00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:22,423
How is he?

158
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:25,864
He didn't survive.

159
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,105
What?

160
00:13:32,555 --> 00:13:34,989
We were able to restore
blood flow to the heart...

161
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:38,347
...but he developed a lethal arrhythmia
and we couldn't resuscitate him.

162
00:13:38,715 --> 00:13:42,185
Wait. I'm sorry, I don't understand.
A what?

163
00:13:45,715 --> 00:13:46,704
I'm sorry.

164
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,433
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

165
00:13:54,995 --> 00:13:56,633
What did you say?

166
00:13:59,475 --> 00:14:00,669
What?

167
00:14:01,995 --> 00:14:03,189
Oh, my God!

168
00:14:31,795 --> 00:14:34,389
On the table, on my table. I'm sorry.

169
00:14:34,675 --> 00:14:36,108
I'm sorry.

170
00:14:38,635 --> 00:14:40,751
I'm sorry. What happened?
What happened?

171
00:14:40,995 --> 00:14:43,031
A graft occlusion? What?

172
00:14:45,075 --> 00:14:47,509
It was textbook. It was textbook.

173
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:55,348
I'm so sorry.

174
00:14:58,035 --> 00:14:59,707
The room got so big.
I was so small.

175
00:14:59,955 --> 00:15:01,911
How did I get so small?

176
00:15:02,795 --> 00:15:03,944
I should've gone back on.

177
00:15:04,315 --> 00:15:06,545
I should've massaged longer.

178
00:15:06,835 --> 00:15:09,793
I should've gone back on.
Massaged longer. I lost it.

179
00:15:12,115 --> 00:15:13,594
I lost it.

180
00:15:31,595 --> 00:15:33,586
Have you ever been seen, Cassiel?

181
00:15:34,995 --> 00:15:35,871
You're looking at me.

182
00:15:36,515 --> 00:15:40,508
No, not by me, and not
by the dying or the delirious.

183
00:15:41,235 --> 00:15:42,827
Have you ever been seen...

184
00:15:43,795 --> 00:15:45,433
...like you were a man?

185
00:15:46,555 --> 00:15:50,707
In a diner once, a blind woman
turned to me all of a sudden...

186
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:52,832
...and asked me to pass her the mustard.

187
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,947
-But she was blind.
-But she knew I was there.

188
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,907
That doctor in the operating room...

189
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:04,472
...she looked right at me.

190
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,309
She didn't see you, Seth.
She can't see you.

191
00:16:07,595 --> 00:16:09,904
No one can see you
unless you want them to.

192
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:12,034
And if I want her to?

193
00:16:13,395 --> 00:16:14,510
Why do you want her to?

194
00:16:16,395 --> 00:16:17,623
To help her.

195
00:16:18,515 --> 00:16:19,470
Open it!

196
00:16:19,755 --> 00:16:21,074
Open it now!

197
00:16:21,675 --> 00:16:22,869
Everybody down!

198
00:16:24,955 --> 00:16:26,593
Do it! Do it!

199
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,593
Shit! Just give him the money.

200
00:16:28,915 --> 00:16:31,349
Did I leave the lights on?
I left the lights on.

201
00:16:31,675 --> 00:16:33,427
I should have gone to Ralphs.

202
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:36,350
-Do it!
-Relax. I'm doing it, okay?

203
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:39,387
I never saw the Grand Canyon.

204
00:16:39,675 --> 00:16:41,154
I'll never see my grandkids again.

205
00:16:42,955 --> 00:16:44,308
What am I doing?

206
00:16:45,235 --> 00:16:46,873
Just be cool. Be cool.

207
00:16:51,555 --> 00:16:52,385
Be cool, man.

208
00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:54,190
Be cool.

209
00:16:59,115 --> 00:17:00,343
Holy shit!

210
00:17:02,675 --> 00:17:04,154
They don't need to see us.

211
00:17:22,715 --> 00:17:24,148
You're early.

212
00:17:55,915 --> 00:17:56,984
What's going on?

213
00:17:57,315 --> 00:17:58,953
Ferris was looking for you.

214
00:18:10,795 --> 00:18:12,228
Don't I have a mitral valve to do?

215
00:18:12,435 --> 00:18:13,993
They canceled it.

216
00:18:14,755 --> 00:18:15,551
Who canceled it?

217
00:18:15,715 --> 00:18:16,591
Sheffield.

218
00:18:17,035 --> 00:18:18,229
Why are you telling me?

219
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,385
He was busy.

220
00:18:19,595 --> 00:18:20,869
He was chickenshit.

221
00:18:21,155 --> 00:18:22,952
-Maggie, you're sick.
-I'm not sick.

222
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,714
You're sick.
You can't operate.

223
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:27,509
They've rescheduled for Monday.
An elective valve, no big deal.

224
00:18:27,795 --> 00:18:30,946
It is unprofessional, and it
embarrasses me in front of my staff.

225
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:37,033
I saw the chart on Balford.

226
00:18:38,475 --> 00:18:40,227
I'm on the committee.
It's on review.

227
00:18:40,915 --> 00:18:42,792
-It wasn't your fault.
-I know.

228
00:18:43,035 --> 00:18:44,354
Then what's the problem?

229
00:18:48,435 --> 00:18:49,663
I don't know.

230
00:18:50,915 --> 00:18:52,746
You put up a terrific fight.

231
00:18:55,795 --> 00:18:57,592
We fight for people's lives, right?

232
00:19:00,315 --> 00:19:02,704
Don't you ever wonder who
it is we're fighting with?

233
00:19:07,075 --> 00:19:08,633
So I'm crazy and chemically imbalanced.

234
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,388
You're tired.

235
00:19:11,515 --> 00:19:12,948
You have moments.

236
00:19:14,835 --> 00:19:15,870
Why didn't you call me?

237
00:19:18,555 --> 00:19:20,466
Because I never sleep
when you stay over.

238
00:19:20,715 --> 00:19:22,592
You never sleep whether
I stay over or not.

239
00:19:24,755 --> 00:19:25,870
You're good.

240
00:19:26,195 --> 00:19:27,389
You know it.

241
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:29,871
Come back Monday
and get back on the horse.

242
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:32,385
Doctor?

243
00:19:38,675 --> 00:19:39,710
I'll see you.

244
00:20:03,355 --> 00:20:06,711
"As I walk along the stony shore
of the pond in my shirtsleeves.... "

245
00:20:06,995 --> 00:20:09,509
"...Amazon basin in the north,
once an island sea.... "

246
00:20:09,795 --> 00:20:12,309
"The highest truth on the
subject remains unsaid...

247
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:14,347
...probably cannot be said.

248
00:20:14,595 --> 00:20:18,554
For all that we say is the far-off
remembering of the intuition... "

249
00:20:18,995 --> 00:20:22,431
"...she begins to pull away from
the awareness she had once.... "

250
00:20:27,515 --> 00:20:28,914
"Commencing search. "
Searching my soul.

251
00:20:29,235 --> 00:20:31,954
What happened to the cards?
You could touch the cards.

252
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,351
She's been looking
at me for half an hour.

253
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:35,954
Maybe if I just hang here....

254
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:40,103
"This is a delicious evening,
when the whole body's one sense.... "

255
00:20:40,475 --> 00:20:43,865
What if I screamed?
What if I just screamed right now?

256
00:20:45,595 --> 00:20:47,984
"When a woman decides to sleep
with a man.... "

257
00:20:49,795 --> 00:20:52,434
"You knew there would always
be a spring...

258
00:20:52,715 --> 00:20:56,947
...as you knew the river
would flow again after it was frozen.

259
00:20:57,315 --> 00:21:00,785
When the cold rains kept on
and killed the spring...

260
00:21:01,155 --> 00:21:05,467
...it was as though a young person
had died for no reason. "

261
00:21:40,035 --> 00:21:42,754
All right, they have rescheduled
the operation for Monday.

262
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,104
What happened yesterday?

263
00:21:44,475 --> 00:21:45,988
They had a golf tournament.

264
00:21:46,275 --> 00:21:47,674
Who knows with these people?

265
00:21:47,955 --> 00:21:49,070
Good morning, Mr. Messinger.

266
00:21:49,435 --> 00:21:51,824
The "G" is soft, like "messenger".

267
00:21:54,315 --> 00:21:55,384
What's on your lip?

268
00:21:55,795 --> 00:21:58,025
What? Am I slobbering here?

269
00:22:02,995 --> 00:22:05,463
-Where did you get that?
-What am l, a prisoner?

270
00:22:05,755 --> 00:22:08,428
You want to get well, or
you want Ben & Jerry's?

271
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:10,148
This operation is a big deal.

272
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,228
Continue to eat like this...

273
00:22:13,155 --> 00:22:15,350
...and you might as well skip it.
Save the 30 grand.

274
00:22:15,595 --> 00:22:19,508
If you'd have performed the operation
yesterday like you were supposed to...

275
00:22:19,835 --> 00:22:23,066
...I'd be sucking carrots through
a straw in my arm. What happened?

276
00:22:23,795 --> 00:22:26,150
Circumstances were not optimal
for the procedure.

277
00:22:26,515 --> 00:22:30,554
I ain't "the procedure". My name is
Nathan Messinger and I'm right here.

278
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:54,230
Hello, hello, hello....

279
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,508
Floating, floating. Don't pop it.
Don't pop it!

280
00:24:01,995 --> 00:24:04,907
Do you know the Muffin Man,
the Muffin Man, the Muffin Man?

281
00:24:48,795 --> 00:24:49,591
Hi, Anne.

282
00:24:49,835 --> 00:24:51,234
What are you doing here?

283
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,433
I was on my way up to x-ray...

284
00:24:53,715 --> 00:24:55,785
...and I thought I'd stop in and just...

285
00:24:56,915 --> 00:24:57,870
...hide.

286
00:24:58,795 --> 00:24:59,830
From what?

287
00:25:01,955 --> 00:25:03,434
I should've gone into pediatrics.

288
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:04,671
Oh, no.

289
00:25:05,035 --> 00:25:07,549
Every guy you meet
is either married or a gyno.

290
00:25:07,795 --> 00:25:10,593
Never date a man who knows more
about your vagina than you do.

291
00:25:13,475 --> 00:25:15,227
Poor little guy.

292
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,187
He never stops crying.

293
00:25:21,435 --> 00:25:23,551
-What's wrong with him?
-No insurance.

294
00:25:25,195 --> 00:25:27,993
Found him in a dumpster
behind the House of Pies.

295
00:25:28,435 --> 00:25:30,153
We worked him up the wazoo
for everything...

296
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:33,228
...from drug exposure to diabetes.
We got nothing.

297
00:25:34,395 --> 00:25:35,464
May I?

298
00:25:47,955 --> 00:25:49,183
Did you do an ultrasound?

299
00:25:49,435 --> 00:25:51,187
-You hear a murmur?
-Worth a shot.

300
00:25:52,355 --> 00:25:54,107
Okay, baby.

301
00:25:57,195 --> 00:25:59,834
So what are you hiding from?

302
00:26:01,795 --> 00:26:03,513
My patient's wife.

303
00:26:04,475 --> 00:26:07,353
She wants me to tell her that her
husband is going to be okay...

304
00:26:07,675 --> 00:26:10,189
...and that I have every confidence...

305
00:26:10,995 --> 00:26:12,110
...and I don't.

306
00:26:12,475 --> 00:26:15,308
And after all this time,
and after all this work...

307
00:26:15,555 --> 00:26:17,864
...I suddenly have this feeling that...

308
00:26:19,315 --> 00:26:21,749
...none of this is in my hands.
Nothing.

309
00:26:22,995 --> 00:26:24,269
And if it isn't...

310
00:26:24,515 --> 00:26:26,073
...what do I do with that?

311
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:24,183
Excuse me.

312
00:27:31,835 --> 00:27:33,234
Are you a visitor?

313
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:35,830
Yes.

314
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:39,515
Visiting hours have been
over since 8:00.

315
00:27:40,235 --> 00:27:41,907
Why do they have that?

316
00:27:42,435 --> 00:27:43,265
What?

317
00:27:43,475 --> 00:27:44,590
Hours.

318
00:27:45,715 --> 00:27:48,104
Doesn't it help the patient
to be visited?

319
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,266
Who are you visiting?
Mr. Messinger?

320
00:27:52,515 --> 00:27:53,664
Right now?

321
00:27:57,755 --> 00:27:58,665
You.

322
00:28:02,755 --> 00:28:04,074
I don't need a visitor.

323
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:05,430
You're not ill?

324
00:28:05,675 --> 00:28:06,585
No.

325
00:28:08,515 --> 00:28:10,471
I'm one of the doctors here.

326
00:28:13,155 --> 00:28:14,634
Are you in despair?

327
00:28:19,075 --> 00:28:20,827
I lost a patient.

328
00:28:21,595 --> 00:28:23,426
You did everything you could?

329
00:28:24,795 --> 00:28:27,355
I was holding his heart
in my hand when he died.

330
00:28:28,515 --> 00:28:30,073
Then he wasn't alone.

331
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:31,624
Yes, he was.

332
00:28:31,915 --> 00:28:32,950
People die.

333
00:28:33,195 --> 00:28:34,230
Not on my table.

334
00:28:34,475 --> 00:28:36,864
People die when their bodies give out.

335
00:28:37,155 --> 00:28:40,511
It's my job to keep their bodies from
giving out. Or what am I doing here?

336
00:28:40,755 --> 00:28:42,552
It wasn't your fault, Maggie.

337
00:28:42,835 --> 00:28:44,268
I wanted him to live.

338
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:45,868
He is living.

339
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:48,346
Just not the way you think.

340
00:28:56,115 --> 00:28:57,673
I don't believe in that.

341
00:28:57,915 --> 00:29:00,907
Some things are true
whether you believe in them or not.

342
00:29:02,555 --> 00:29:04,068
How did you know my name?

343
00:29:08,195 --> 00:29:09,423
What's yours?

344
00:29:11,355 --> 00:29:12,504
Seth.

345
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:22,353
You better get out of here, Seth...

346
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:25,189
...or security's going to think
you're a psych patient.

347
00:30:34,595 --> 00:30:36,711
-Where are we?
-Down a liter.

348
00:30:38,315 --> 00:30:39,065
Suction.

349
00:30:39,995 --> 00:30:44,910
I am stuck on Band-Aid brand
'Cause Band-Aid's stuck on me

350
00:30:50,595 --> 00:30:54,952
No dying now, Mr. Messinger. Not until
you give me Seth's phone number.

351
00:30:56,315 --> 00:31:00,866
I am stuck on Band-Aid brand
'Cause Band-Aid's stuck on me

352
00:31:27,475 --> 00:31:29,067
Those eyes.

353
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:31,666
The way he looked...

354
00:31:32,155 --> 00:31:34,146
...right down into me.

355
00:31:36,115 --> 00:31:37,389
Seth.

356
00:31:38,795 --> 00:31:41,025
What kind of name is Seth?

357
00:33:37,795 --> 00:33:39,194
I thought you'd be here.

358
00:33:40,475 --> 00:33:41,544
Salty.

359
00:33:41,995 --> 00:33:44,384
My transplant tanked at 2 a.m.

360
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:47,069
You okay?

361
00:33:53,755 --> 00:33:55,552
You might want to return this.

362
00:33:59,515 --> 00:34:03,110
That part about the spring?
"You knew there'd always be a spring".

363
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,547
How did you know that...?

364
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,871
What? I didn't give you this book.

365
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:12,785
You didn't?

366
00:34:13,315 --> 00:34:14,464
Where'd you get it?

367
00:34:25,955 --> 00:34:29,072
Hi. I'm a physician, and I think
a patient left that in my office.

368
00:34:29,315 --> 00:34:32,193
-Can you tell me who checked it out?
-I can't tell you who.

369
00:34:32,435 --> 00:34:34,312
I can tell you when.

370
00:34:35,795 --> 00:34:37,353
All right, give me 5 minutes.

371
00:35:07,955 --> 00:35:09,354
Hello, Maggie.

372
00:35:11,675 --> 00:35:13,393
It's nice to see you again.

373
00:35:13,795 --> 00:35:15,433
It's weird to see you again.

374
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:17,434
Weird is nice.

375
00:35:21,155 --> 00:35:22,224
You like Hemingway?

376
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:25,433
Yeah, I'm starting to.

377
00:35:31,075 --> 00:35:31,951
May I?

378
00:35:34,595 --> 00:35:37,553
"As I ate the oysters with their
strong taste of the sea...

379
00:35:37,915 --> 00:35:39,951
...and their faint metallic taste...

380
00:35:40,475 --> 00:35:42,705
...as I drank their cold liquid
from each shell...

381
00:35:42,955 --> 00:35:45,708
...and washed it down
with the crisp taste of the wine...

382
00:35:46,035 --> 00:35:47,787
...I lost the empty feeling...

383
00:35:48,155 --> 00:35:50,032
...and began to be happy".

384
00:35:50,835 --> 00:35:53,224
He never forgets to describe
how things taste.

385
00:35:54,675 --> 00:35:55,949
I like that.

386
00:35:58,515 --> 00:36:00,392
Do you come here a lot?

387
00:36:01,035 --> 00:36:02,263
I live here.

388
00:36:03,755 --> 00:36:05,188
What do you do?

389
00:36:05,475 --> 00:36:06,385
Read.

390
00:36:06,635 --> 00:36:08,830
No, I mean, your work.

391
00:36:10,115 --> 00:36:11,434
I'm a messenger.

392
00:36:13,515 --> 00:36:15,506
What kind of messenger?
A bike messenger?

393
00:36:15,955 --> 00:36:18,264
No, I'm a messenger of God.

394
00:36:20,315 --> 00:36:21,464
Got a message for me?

395
00:36:22,515 --> 00:36:23,948
I already gave it to you.

396
00:36:24,195 --> 00:36:28,074
Did you use my pager? I usually don't
get my messages unless you beep me.

397
00:36:29,155 --> 00:36:32,306
You've definitely been beeped.

398
00:36:34,475 --> 00:36:36,511
-How is Messinger?
-He's good.

399
00:36:36,835 --> 00:36:38,553
The operation went really well.

400
00:36:39,075 --> 00:36:41,145
-It was a good day.
-It was.

401
00:36:41,395 --> 00:36:43,625
Yeah, I didn't kill anybody today.

402
00:36:44,195 --> 00:36:46,834
-You're an excellent doctor.
-How do you know?

403
00:36:47,715 --> 00:36:48,784
I have a feeling.

404
00:36:49,155 --> 00:36:51,225
That's pretty flimsy evidence.

405
00:36:52,115 --> 00:36:53,150
Close your eyes.

406
00:36:55,955 --> 00:36:57,354
It's just for a moment.

407
00:37:16,755 --> 00:37:18,188
What am I doing?

408
00:37:20,315 --> 00:37:22,465
You're touching me.

409
00:37:23,435 --> 00:37:24,788
Touch.

410
00:37:26,315 --> 00:37:27,543
How do you know?

411
00:37:29,035 --> 00:37:30,627
Because I feel it.

412
00:37:39,075 --> 00:37:40,633
You should trust that.

413
00:37:41,355 --> 00:37:43,073
You don't trust it enough.

414
00:37:55,235 --> 00:37:57,351
-Let's go somewhere.
-Where?

415
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:58,785
I don't care.

416
00:37:59,955 --> 00:38:01,183
What do you want to do?

417
00:38:01,955 --> 00:38:03,434
Anything.

418
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,633
What's that like?

419
00:38:51,315 --> 00:38:52,907
What's it taste like?

420
00:38:53,355 --> 00:38:54,947
Describe it. Like Hemingway.

421
00:38:57,075 --> 00:38:58,986
Well, it tastes like...

422
00:38:59,955 --> 00:39:01,149
...a pear.

423
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:03,945
You don't know what a pear tastes like?

424
00:39:04,635 --> 00:39:07,149
I don't know what a pear
tastes like to you.

425
00:39:13,155 --> 00:39:14,474
Sweet...

426
00:39:14,835 --> 00:39:16,109
...juicy.

427
00:39:17,635 --> 00:39:20,388
Soft on your tongue.
Grainy...

428
00:39:20,755 --> 00:39:23,508
...like sugary sand that
dissolves in your mouth.

429
00:39:27,155 --> 00:39:28,383
How's that?

430
00:39:31,515 --> 00:39:32,914
It's perfect.

431
00:39:49,635 --> 00:39:53,992
The first time I looked in a microscope,
I knew I wanted to be a doctor.

432
00:39:57,235 --> 00:39:59,066
Okay, let me have your hand.

433
00:39:59,675 --> 00:40:00,790
What for?

434
00:40:01,075 --> 00:40:02,747
We'll take a look at your blood.

435
00:40:03,755 --> 00:40:05,427
Not a possibility.

436
00:40:08,675 --> 00:40:09,790
Men.

437
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:12,265
I suppose you know a woman's
threshold of pain...

438
00:40:12,515 --> 00:40:14,346
...is 9 times higher than a man's.

439
00:40:24,995 --> 00:40:26,394
Take a look at that.

440
00:40:29,955 --> 00:40:31,946
That's bright.

441
00:40:36,915 --> 00:40:38,189
That's me.

442
00:40:39,155 --> 00:40:40,349
All those cells.

443
00:40:41,715 --> 00:40:43,387
That's all you are.

444
00:40:45,555 --> 00:40:47,785
That and all the space in between.

445
00:40:48,995 --> 00:40:50,986
If this is all you are...

446
00:40:51,235 --> 00:40:52,907
...these cells...

447
00:40:53,795 --> 00:40:55,945
...then when they die, that's the end.

448
00:40:57,195 --> 00:40:58,913
I don't know. I think so.

449
00:41:00,835 --> 00:41:02,507
How do you explain it?

450
00:41:02,755 --> 00:41:03,710
What?

451
00:41:05,355 --> 00:41:07,425
The enduring myth of Heaven.

452
00:41:12,315 --> 00:41:14,590
I used to think that I had it
all figured out.

453
00:41:14,835 --> 00:41:15,904
But you didn't?

454
00:41:16,315 --> 00:41:17,350
No.

455
00:41:22,555 --> 00:41:26,343
Because something happened
in my O.R. and I got...

456
00:41:26,835 --> 00:41:30,191
...this jolt. I got this feeling
that there's something...

457
00:41:30,635 --> 00:41:34,025
...bigger out there. Something bigger
than me, bigger than you, and it....

458
00:41:35,595 --> 00:41:37,233
Does that sound crazy?

459
00:41:37,955 --> 00:41:38,990
No.

460
00:41:40,315 --> 00:41:42,909
I couldn't fix him.
I did everything right...

461
00:41:43,155 --> 00:41:44,827
...and I couldn't fix him.

462
00:41:45,955 --> 00:41:47,673
That's not supposed to happen.

463
00:41:50,315 --> 00:41:51,668
And I...

464
00:41:52,195 --> 00:41:53,514
You cried.

465
00:41:56,635 --> 00:41:57,670
Yeah.

466
00:41:59,715 --> 00:42:02,673
-Why do people cry?
-What do you mean?

467
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:05,744
I mean, what happens physically?

468
00:42:09,395 --> 00:42:12,831
Tear ducts operate on a normal basis
to lubricate and protect the eye.

469
00:42:13,075 --> 00:42:16,226
When you have an emotion,
they overact and create tears.

470
00:42:16,475 --> 00:42:18,386
Why? Why do they overact?

471
00:42:21,075 --> 00:42:22,394
I don't know.

472
00:42:25,035 --> 00:42:26,946
Maybe emotion becomes so intense...

473
00:42:27,195 --> 00:42:28,992
...your body just can't contain it.

474
00:42:29,235 --> 00:42:32,750
Your mind and your feelings
become too powerful.

475
00:42:32,995 --> 00:42:34,667
Your body weeps.

476
00:42:40,635 --> 00:42:41,670
I have to go.

477
00:42:41,955 --> 00:42:43,866
I got to go. Stay right here.

478
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,623
Don't go anywhere.

479
00:42:46,115 --> 00:42:47,548
Stay right there.

480
00:43:07,755 --> 00:43:09,154
-Get the tube out.
-He can't breathe.

481
00:43:09,435 --> 00:43:11,187
It's because the tube is blocked.

482
00:43:22,835 --> 00:43:24,188
How you feeling?

483
00:43:24,515 --> 00:43:26,312
Ready to hit the waves.

484
00:43:26,555 --> 00:43:29,069
I'm afraid your bodysurfing
days are over.

485
00:43:31,555 --> 00:43:35,434
You got a mean tattoo going there.
What does your wife think of that?

486
00:43:36,595 --> 00:43:38,347
That is my wife.

487
00:43:47,075 --> 00:43:49,225
Check his vitals every 15.

488
00:44:05,715 --> 00:44:07,433
I can't see you,
but I know you're there.

489
00:44:14,995 --> 00:44:17,031
Go back and tell them
that I'm not going.

490
00:44:18,635 --> 00:44:20,034
Not yet.

491
00:44:47,835 --> 00:44:49,188
Where have you been?

492
00:44:49,755 --> 00:44:52,110
Oh, shit. I totally forgot dinner.

493
00:44:52,435 --> 00:44:53,663
Dinner?

494
00:44:54,115 --> 00:44:55,230
With who?

495
00:44:58,995 --> 00:45:01,748
A guy I met. I bumped into him
and we got something to eat.

496
00:45:01,995 --> 00:45:03,508
Did you pack my backpack?

497
00:45:04,355 --> 00:45:05,629
What else?

498
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:08,069
We talked...

499
00:45:08,315 --> 00:45:10,385
...and then I got beeped
and he disappeared.

500
00:45:10,635 --> 00:45:11,863
Why did you pack my backpack?

501
00:45:12,355 --> 00:45:13,993
Earl, what are you doing?

502
00:45:14,235 --> 00:45:16,795
I thought we'd fly up to Tahoe,
use your uncle's cabin...

503
00:45:17,075 --> 00:45:18,303
...maybe do a little hiking.

504
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:20,830
What?

505
00:45:23,635 --> 00:45:25,432
God. Is it...?

506
00:45:25,755 --> 00:45:26,904
Maggie, it's just a tick.

507
00:45:27,395 --> 00:45:30,148
-Get a match.
-We're not going to burn him, Jordan.

508
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:32,226
It'll have to back out.
Can't leave the head in.

509
00:45:32,475 --> 00:45:35,467
-We can't just be burning tick heads.
-Then get some alcohol.

510
00:45:35,715 --> 00:45:36,545
I don't have any.

511
00:45:36,795 --> 00:45:38,945
-You don't have any alcohol?
-I don't operate here.

512
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:40,628
How about some olive oil?

513
00:45:43,275 --> 00:45:44,788
Which kind? Jalapeno or rosemary?

514
00:45:45,635 --> 00:45:46,988
Rosemary.

515
00:45:48,195 --> 00:45:51,710
So what did you and your friend...
What did you say his name was?

516
00:45:53,395 --> 00:45:54,350
Seth.

517
00:45:54,595 --> 00:45:56,392
What did you two talk about?

518
00:45:58,035 --> 00:45:59,184
Dying.

519
00:46:01,555 --> 00:46:05,070
Come on, we deal with life and death
every day. Why can't we talk about it?

520
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:08,228
I hope you won't become a
surgeon who prays in the O.R.

521
00:46:16,555 --> 00:46:17,829
Can we talk for a minute?

522
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:19,349
We'll talk while camping.

523
00:46:19,595 --> 00:46:21,870
Jordan, I can't go camping now.

524
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:23,753
We need some time together.

525
00:46:24,795 --> 00:46:27,389
All right, let's see if we can
just spend 5 minutes.

526
00:46:27,635 --> 00:46:30,707
Let's see if we can just stand
still together for 5 minutes.

527
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:32,431
Doing what?

528
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:34,593
Just being here.

529
00:46:35,955 --> 00:46:37,593
I'll get the trail map.

530
00:46:38,115 --> 00:46:39,150
No, I mean it.

531
00:46:39,635 --> 00:46:40,863
Nothing but us.

532
00:46:44,195 --> 00:46:45,423
What do I do?

533
00:46:46,835 --> 00:46:48,154
Just look at me.

534
00:46:59,795 --> 00:47:00,830
You can't do it.

535
00:47:02,715 --> 00:47:04,307
You can't do it.

536
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:07,069
-You flinched. You lose!
-You cheat.

537
00:47:20,955 --> 00:47:23,947
That old black magic called...

538
00:47:24,195 --> 00:47:25,867
...love.

539
00:47:26,435 --> 00:47:27,993
Thank you very much.

540
00:47:28,235 --> 00:47:31,750
Welcome back. We've been talking
to mothers who are members of the KKK.

541
00:47:33,955 --> 00:47:35,547
You want to watch anything?

542
00:47:39,115 --> 00:47:40,434
Me neither.

543
00:47:48,555 --> 00:47:50,386
How do you know when I'm here?

544
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:57,103
I know.

545
00:47:59,235 --> 00:48:00,748
Jeez, you look good.

546
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:05,106
I forgot how good everybody looked.

547
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,626
30 years of silence.

548
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:13,470
You got guts, kid, showing yourself
like that. I appreciate that. I do.

549
00:48:13,715 --> 00:48:14,989
It'll make it easier.

550
00:48:16,355 --> 00:48:18,550
I got to tell you, I feel fine.

551
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:20,308
You might want to check your orders...

552
00:48:20,555 --> 00:48:22,511
...because I sure don't feel
like I'm dying.

553
00:48:22,755 --> 00:48:23,904
You're not dying.

554
00:48:24,155 --> 00:48:27,511
Right. Then how come you're
hanging around my room all the time?

555
00:48:27,755 --> 00:48:29,950
I'm the only one with his ass
hanging out of his dress.

556
00:48:31,395 --> 00:48:32,828
Unless....

557
00:48:36,195 --> 00:48:37,787
Could it be...

558
00:48:38,835 --> 00:48:39,984
...the doctor?

559
00:48:41,555 --> 00:48:42,874
Sure.

560
00:48:43,115 --> 00:48:44,594
The doctor.

561
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:47,073
She's pretty.

562
00:48:47,315 --> 00:48:48,828
A little flat-chested...

563
00:48:49,075 --> 00:48:50,747
...but all you need's a handful.

564
00:48:51,035 --> 00:48:53,026
-Who are you?
-This is good.

565
00:48:53,475 --> 00:48:55,511
This is what they call...

566
00:48:55,755 --> 00:48:57,825
..."serendipitous".

567
00:48:58,075 --> 00:49:01,306
Look that up in the dictionary,
you'll see a picture of you and me.

568
00:49:01,595 --> 00:49:02,744
Thank you.

569
00:49:09,475 --> 00:49:11,147
You ready to deal?

570
00:49:11,635 --> 00:49:14,308
Because I can answer all
your questions, friend.

571
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:24,910
How's the French toast?

572
00:49:25,635 --> 00:49:26,545
Fabulous.

573
00:49:26,795 --> 00:49:27,864
Set me up.

574
00:49:36,115 --> 00:49:38,026
Guess I should introduce myself.

575
00:49:38,755 --> 00:49:40,188
Come on, give me your hand.

576
00:49:41,915 --> 00:49:44,110
Put it in mine. There you go.

577
00:49:44,395 --> 00:49:46,306
A little tighter. Tighter.
There you go.

578
00:49:46,555 --> 00:49:47,908
No, that's too much.

579
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,305
There you go. Good grip.

580
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:52,708
Nathaniel Messinger.

581
00:49:52,955 --> 00:49:54,673
Glutton, hedonist...

582
00:49:54,915 --> 00:49:59,067
...former celestial body,
recent addition to the human race.

583
00:50:02,795 --> 00:50:04,387
I don't believe you.

584
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:05,863
You want proof?

585
00:50:06,355 --> 00:50:08,107
You hang out at a library.

586
00:50:08,355 --> 00:50:09,947
You can speak every language.

587
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:12,152
You travel with the speed of thought...

588
00:50:12,395 --> 00:50:14,226
...and you're reading
my mind right now.

589
00:50:14,715 --> 00:50:15,591
Stop that.

590
00:50:15,955 --> 00:50:17,024
You're doing it.

591
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:19,784
It's impossible.

592
00:50:20,155 --> 00:50:23,147
"Some things are true
whether you believe them or not".

593
00:50:25,595 --> 00:50:26,710
How?

594
00:50:27,395 --> 00:50:28,623
-You choose.
-Choose?

595
00:50:28,875 --> 00:50:30,433
To fall to Earth.

596
00:50:30,675 --> 00:50:33,508
You take the plunge,
the tumble, the dive.

597
00:50:33,755 --> 00:50:35,711
You jump off a bridge.
Leap out a window.

598
00:50:35,955 --> 00:50:38,674
You just make up your mind
to do it and you do it.

599
00:50:41,755 --> 00:50:44,713
You wake up all smelly,
and aching from head to toe...

600
00:50:44,955 --> 00:50:46,627
...and hungrier than you've
ever been...

601
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:50,265
...only you have no idea what hunger is
or any of that stuff...

602
00:50:50,515 --> 00:50:54,349
...so it's all real confusing
and painful, but very, very good.

603
00:50:56,955 --> 00:50:58,229
Human.

604
00:51:00,075 --> 00:51:01,190
Listen, kid:

605
00:51:02,595 --> 00:51:05,553
He gave these bozos
the greatest gift in the universe.

606
00:51:05,795 --> 00:51:07,831
You think He didn't give it to us too?

607
00:51:08,155 --> 00:51:08,985
Which gift?

608
00:51:09,675 --> 00:51:11,233
Free will, brother.

609
00:51:12,395 --> 00:51:13,874
Free will.

610
00:51:40,355 --> 00:51:41,868
Couldn't get a job.

611
00:51:42,395 --> 00:51:44,192
No past, no training.

612
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:45,868
No I.D.

613
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:49,865
Then one day, I was walking
past a building site.

614
00:51:50,115 --> 00:51:51,468
A skyscraper.

615
00:51:51,715 --> 00:51:54,229
And I thought, "I could do that".

616
00:51:54,475 --> 00:51:56,306
You see, these people down here...

617
00:51:56,555 --> 00:51:59,467
...a lot of them are afraid of heights,
you know what I'm saying?

618
00:51:59,715 --> 00:52:02,787
That makes me uniquely qualified.

619
00:52:03,355 --> 00:52:06,950
And besides, it feels like
a little bit of home up here.

620
00:52:07,195 --> 00:52:08,423
And I like what I do.

621
00:52:08,715 --> 00:52:09,784
I'm good at it.

622
00:52:12,315 --> 00:52:14,431
These things'll kill you.

623
00:52:16,155 --> 00:52:17,383
Are there others?

624
00:52:18,115 --> 00:52:19,628
Others like you?

625
00:52:19,995 --> 00:52:21,428
Yeah, they're out there.

626
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:25,629
You see them, but most of the time
you just walk on by.

627
00:52:26,035 --> 00:52:29,584
Nobody likes to think of the old life.
You know, what they gave up.

628
00:52:30,235 --> 00:52:31,748
Then why'd you do it?

629
00:52:40,835 --> 00:52:42,393
My daughter, Ruth...

630
00:52:42,635 --> 00:52:44,387
...her stupid husband, Frank...

631
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,394
...and my grandkids.

632
00:52:46,635 --> 00:52:48,944
Petie's 4, Hannah's 6.

633
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:54,703
And this is my wife, Teresa.

634
00:52:57,915 --> 00:52:59,189
Did you...

635
00:53:00,115 --> 00:53:01,673
...tell her who you were?

636
00:53:02,675 --> 00:53:05,143
I started to try once or twice.

637
00:53:05,555 --> 00:53:07,386
Then I thought, "Why do that to her?"

638
00:53:07,635 --> 00:53:08,863
Do what?

639
00:53:09,435 --> 00:53:11,153
It's too much for them.

640
00:53:12,395 --> 00:53:14,670
People don't believe in us anymore.

641
00:53:23,835 --> 00:53:25,985
Do they still gather together
at sunrise?

642
00:53:26,555 --> 00:53:28,352
And sunset, yes.

643
00:53:29,635 --> 00:53:31,068
Take me there?

644
00:53:42,035 --> 00:53:43,593
Can you hear it?

645
00:53:53,995 --> 00:53:54,984
No.

646
00:54:13,195 --> 00:54:14,708
I can't hear that!

647
00:54:14,955 --> 00:54:17,230
But you can't feel this!

648
00:54:17,715 --> 00:54:18,989
Nathan!

649
00:54:25,875 --> 00:54:27,103
You have to go back.

650
00:54:27,355 --> 00:54:29,391
Not until I catch the big wave.

651
00:54:33,555 --> 00:54:34,670
Wait.

652
00:54:35,315 --> 00:54:36,384
Wait.

653
00:54:36,635 --> 00:54:38,034
Wait for what?

654
00:54:39,155 --> 00:54:40,224
Swim!

655
00:55:14,555 --> 00:55:16,466
And then you just...

656
00:55:16,915 --> 00:55:17,984
...fall.

657
00:55:18,555 --> 00:55:20,034
-Fall?
-Dive.

658
00:55:21,035 --> 00:55:22,991
You make up your mind to do it...

659
00:55:23,955 --> 00:55:25,388
...and you do it.

660
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:28,070
And when you wake up, you're...?

661
00:55:28,715 --> 00:55:30,034
Yes.

662
00:55:32,235 --> 00:55:34,032
To smell the air.

663
00:55:34,555 --> 00:55:35,908
Taste water.

664
00:55:36,155 --> 00:55:37,190
Read a newspaper.

665
00:55:37,435 --> 00:55:38,151
To lie.

666
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:39,834
Through your teeth.

667
00:55:40,475 --> 00:55:41,385
To feed the dog.

668
00:55:44,235 --> 00:55:45,509
Touch her hair.

669
00:55:47,955 --> 00:55:49,434
What are you waiting for?

670
00:55:54,795 --> 00:55:57,229
There is so much beauty up here.

671
00:55:58,995 --> 00:56:00,223
Yes.

672
00:56:24,315 --> 00:56:25,464
Here you are again.

673
00:56:26,995 --> 00:56:28,747
We'll release your friend
Messinger tomorrow.

674
00:56:29,035 --> 00:56:30,150
That's good.

675
00:56:30,395 --> 00:56:33,626
His family's having a kind
of a welcome-home party.

676
00:56:36,635 --> 00:56:38,034
Will you be going?

677
00:56:38,555 --> 00:56:39,954
Will you be going?

678
00:56:42,675 --> 00:56:43,585
This is Earl.

679
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:45,103
He told me.

680
00:56:46,195 --> 00:56:47,344
What else does he tell you?

681
00:56:47,595 --> 00:56:51,383
He worries that you never sleep.
And he loves to see you smile.

682
00:56:52,115 --> 00:56:55,027
Sometimes I think Earl's the
only one who understands me.

683
00:56:55,275 --> 00:56:56,310
What about your boyfriend?

684
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:58,149
Do you love him?

685
00:57:01,035 --> 00:57:02,309
Love? I don't know.

686
00:57:02,555 --> 00:57:03,829
What does that mean?

687
00:57:04,715 --> 00:57:06,706
I was hoping you could tell me.

688
00:57:07,635 --> 00:57:09,671
It's a word...

689
00:57:09,915 --> 00:57:12,475
...that describes a chemical react...

690
00:57:13,995 --> 00:57:16,555
It's just crap. I'm full of crap.

691
00:57:18,395 --> 00:57:21,626
I wait all day, just hoping
for one more minute with you...

692
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:23,354
...and I don't even know you.

693
00:57:23,955 --> 00:57:25,547
What do you want to know?

694
00:57:27,475 --> 00:57:29,147
Why you wear the same
clothes all the time.

695
00:57:29,395 --> 00:57:31,545
Why won't you give me
your phone number?

696
00:57:32,595 --> 00:57:33,710
Are you married?

697
00:57:34,395 --> 00:57:35,384
No.

698
00:57:36,235 --> 00:57:37,190
Are you homeless?

699
00:57:38,715 --> 00:57:39,750
No.

700
00:57:40,835 --> 00:57:41,950
Are you a drummer?

701
00:57:46,675 --> 00:57:48,586
Why don't you ever touch me?

702
00:57:52,395 --> 00:57:54,033
I don't want to hurt you.

703
00:57:56,435 --> 00:57:57,868
You won't hurt me.

704
00:58:21,875 --> 00:58:23,194
Did you feel that?

705
00:58:36,115 --> 00:58:38,345
If I could make you understand....

706
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:42,868
I understand.

707
00:58:47,475 --> 00:58:49,033
I'll see you around.

708
00:59:51,315 --> 00:59:52,464
Hey, Doc!

709
00:59:55,155 --> 00:59:57,749
No, give me the whole package.
Come here.

710
00:59:58,635 --> 01:00:00,068
-Hi.
-Thanks for coming.

711
01:00:00,315 --> 01:00:01,589
You look great.

712
01:00:03,355 --> 01:00:04,231
Is this heaven?

713
01:00:04,635 --> 01:00:05,829
Look at this.

714
01:00:10,235 --> 01:00:11,953
Come on, let's meet some people.

715
01:00:12,355 --> 01:00:13,754
You got an appetite?

716
01:00:18,155 --> 01:00:19,508
Have a beer, Seth.

717
01:00:20,315 --> 01:00:21,270
Where you from?

718
01:00:22,635 --> 01:00:23,385
Up.

719
01:00:23,635 --> 01:00:25,705
North. Uh, Canada.

720
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:34,074
Listen. Can you hear?

721
01:00:34,995 --> 01:00:36,394
I'm growing.

722
01:00:37,075 --> 01:00:37,951
Smile, Hannah.

723
01:00:47,315 --> 01:00:48,634
How long have you known Seth?

724
01:00:50,555 --> 01:00:51,783
Not very long.

725
01:00:53,235 --> 01:00:55,430
But I feel like I've known him forever.

726
01:00:56,475 --> 01:00:58,386
Honey, that hurts.

727
01:01:00,435 --> 01:01:02,073
You're just like Grandpa.

728
01:01:04,075 --> 01:01:05,190
Come on.

729
01:01:05,835 --> 01:01:07,109
Let's see if the cookies are done.

730
01:01:07,595 --> 01:01:08,584
Come on, Seth.

731
01:01:08,835 --> 01:01:10,951
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, great.

732
01:01:16,115 --> 01:01:17,343
How did you two meet?

733
01:01:18,995 --> 01:01:21,668
He works with me over at the site.
Construction work.

734
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:23,789
I thought he was a messenger.

735
01:01:24,915 --> 01:01:26,871
Yeah, he's one of those...

736
01:01:27,115 --> 01:01:28,025
..."hyphenates".

737
01:01:28,915 --> 01:01:30,189
I'll be right back.

738
01:02:08,315 --> 01:02:09,828
Here, can you cut this up?

739
01:02:17,395 --> 01:02:19,784
So in what province in Canada
were you born?

740
01:02:20,755 --> 01:02:22,473
I wasn't born in Canada.

741
01:02:26,915 --> 01:02:28,143
What are your parents' names?

742
01:02:36,355 --> 01:02:37,629
No parents.

743
01:02:44,715 --> 01:02:47,468
You have very delicate hands
for a construction worker.

744
01:02:47,795 --> 01:02:49,148
I'm not a construction worker.

745
01:02:49,435 --> 01:02:51,551
Very pale hands. Let me see.

746
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:57,630
-Why did you do that?
-Let me see your hand.

747
01:02:57,915 --> 01:02:58,745
No.

748
01:03:00,795 --> 01:03:01,750
What's your last name?

749
01:03:02,035 --> 01:03:03,104
You know my last name.

750
01:03:03,395 --> 01:03:04,510
I don't.

751
01:03:06,715 --> 01:03:07,704
Plate.

752
01:03:08,515 --> 01:03:09,504
Seth Plate?

753
01:03:15,995 --> 01:03:17,474
I cut you.

754
01:03:19,355 --> 01:03:20,674
I cut you.

755
01:03:22,835 --> 01:03:26,623
I cut you with that knife.
I felt it go in. You felt it.

756
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:28,869
Not the way you do.

757
01:03:30,395 --> 01:03:31,874
The way I do?
What does that mean?

758
01:03:32,155 --> 01:03:35,591
You mean the way a doctor does?
The way a woman does? What?

759
01:03:35,875 --> 01:03:37,149
The way...

760
01:03:38,395 --> 01:03:39,305
...a human does.

761
01:03:41,755 --> 01:03:43,108
I have no sense of touch.

762
01:03:44,475 --> 01:03:45,225
You feel that?

763
01:03:45,755 --> 01:03:47,154
Don't be frightened.

764
01:03:47,515 --> 01:03:48,630
You freak!

765
01:03:48,915 --> 01:03:49,984
You liar!

766
01:03:50,555 --> 01:03:52,227
Who... What are you?

767
01:03:52,635 --> 01:03:54,068
I came to take Mr. Balford...

768
01:03:55,395 --> 01:03:56,874
...and I saw you.

769
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,985
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

770
01:04:01,795 --> 01:04:03,547
How you fought for him.

771
01:04:05,555 --> 01:04:07,386
And you looked right at me...

772
01:04:07,995 --> 01:04:09,633
...like I was a man.

773
01:04:10,195 --> 01:04:12,948
-"To take Mr. Balford"?
-I was there.

774
01:04:13,235 --> 01:04:16,989
-We're always there in every room.
-What are you talking about?

775
01:04:17,475 --> 01:04:18,908
I was there in the stairwell...

776
01:04:19,795 --> 01:04:21,751
...when you cried for your patient.

777
01:04:22,075 --> 01:04:24,350
And I touched you. Remember?

778
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:27,874
Why are you doing this?

779
01:04:29,235 --> 01:04:30,873
Because I'm in love with you.

780
01:04:38,595 --> 01:04:40,074
I don't believe you.

781
01:04:40,995 --> 01:04:42,348
Do you feel that?

782
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:46,514
You don't want to believe me.

783
01:04:47,155 --> 01:04:49,032
I cannot conceive of it!

784
01:04:50,995 --> 01:04:52,348
Just get out!

785
01:04:53,435 --> 01:04:54,754
Get out!

786
01:05:42,915 --> 01:05:43,904
Doctor?

787
01:05:46,835 --> 01:05:47,870
Doctor?

788
01:06:32,915 --> 01:06:33,984
Hello?

789
01:06:40,755 --> 01:06:41,744
Seth?

790
01:06:45,315 --> 01:06:46,509
Are you here?

791
01:07:41,075 --> 01:07:42,793
I want to see you.

792
01:07:45,315 --> 01:07:46,953
Let me see you.

793
01:08:15,435 --> 01:08:16,834
Just stay.

794
01:08:19,635 --> 01:08:21,751
Just stay until I fall asleep.

795
01:08:57,435 --> 01:08:59,107
Oh, yes!

796
01:09:01,915 --> 01:09:03,189
Thank you.

797
01:09:23,875 --> 01:09:25,593
The baby can't sleep.

798
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:27,953
Has anyone ever seen the baby sleep?

799
01:09:28,315 --> 01:09:30,510
I don't know. Let's check him out.

800
01:09:39,795 --> 01:09:40,910
Choanal atresia.

801
01:09:41,155 --> 01:09:43,385
There's hardly any air getting through.

802
01:09:44,115 --> 01:09:44,991
How did you know?

803
01:09:46,995 --> 01:09:48,348
I just...

804
01:09:50,075 --> 01:09:51,030
...knew!

805
01:10:15,955 --> 01:10:16,944
Maggie?

806
01:10:17,595 --> 01:10:18,550
Yeah.

807
01:10:18,835 --> 01:10:19,904
Are you alone?

808
01:10:20,755 --> 01:10:21,710
Yeah.

809
01:10:25,635 --> 01:10:27,910
Pretty intuitive call on the baby.

810
01:10:28,315 --> 01:10:29,464
Think so?

811
01:10:30,875 --> 01:10:31,944
I couldn't have done it better.

812
01:10:33,355 --> 01:10:34,788
Well, that's a compliment.

813
01:10:49,235 --> 01:10:50,714
What are you doing?

814
01:10:51,035 --> 01:10:52,434
I'm spending time with you.

815
01:10:55,195 --> 01:10:56,548
Will you marry me?

816
01:10:57,555 --> 01:10:59,352
We can finally get up to Tahoe.

817
01:10:59,675 --> 01:11:01,074
Get married on the Nevada side...

818
01:11:01,395 --> 01:11:03,351
...honeymoon and be back
before we miss a case.

819
01:11:05,515 --> 01:11:07,904
What do you want me to do?
Get down on my knees?

820
01:11:08,555 --> 01:11:09,749
What do you want me to say?

821
01:11:10,715 --> 01:11:12,307
We belong together.

822
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:14,467
We're the same species.

823
01:11:20,795 --> 01:11:24,105
I'm not very good at matters
of the heart. I mean...

824
01:11:24,715 --> 01:11:26,387
...the proverbial heart.

825
01:11:29,555 --> 01:11:30,988
Please be my wife.

826
01:11:35,355 --> 01:11:36,470
Just think about it.

827
01:11:51,555 --> 01:11:52,670
Breathe in.

828
01:11:56,475 --> 01:11:57,510
Breathe in.

829
01:12:10,515 --> 01:12:11,550
I'm good.

830
01:12:19,155 --> 01:12:23,626
I don't understand a God who would let
us meet, if we could never be together.

831
01:12:27,115 --> 01:12:28,104
He didn't tell you.

832
01:12:32,195 --> 01:12:33,105
Tell me what?

833
01:12:33,755 --> 01:12:34,983
Maybe you should ask him.

834
01:12:35,715 --> 01:12:37,353
No, I'm asking you.

835
01:12:48,395 --> 01:12:50,067
Seth knows no fear...

836
01:12:50,395 --> 01:12:51,589
...no pain...

837
01:12:51,875 --> 01:12:53,354
...no hunger.

838
01:12:54,475 --> 01:12:56,750
He hears music in the sunrise.

839
01:12:58,995 --> 01:13:00,713
But he'd give it all up.

840
01:13:00,995 --> 01:13:02,428
He loves you that much.

841
01:13:05,075 --> 01:13:06,713
I don't understand.

842
01:13:09,675 --> 01:13:11,108
He can fall.

843
01:13:11,755 --> 01:13:14,315
He can give up his existence
as he knows it.

844
01:13:14,595 --> 01:13:17,507
He can give up eternity and become...

845
01:13:17,795 --> 01:13:18,910
...one of us.

846
01:13:19,715 --> 01:13:20,989
It's up to you.

847
01:13:22,875 --> 01:13:24,388
How do you know this?

848
01:13:30,075 --> 01:13:31,588
Because I did it.

849
01:14:07,595 --> 01:14:09,426
Seth, I need to talk to you.

850
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:15,546
Seth, please.

851
01:14:18,515 --> 01:14:19,504
Please be here.

852
01:14:21,795 --> 01:14:23,626
God, help me through this.

853
01:14:34,555 --> 01:14:36,113
You are so beautiful.

854
01:14:38,755 --> 01:14:40,427
You'll always be that way.

855
01:14:43,835 --> 01:14:45,632
Jordan asked me to go away with him...

856
01:14:45,915 --> 01:14:47,234
...and get married.

857
01:14:49,995 --> 01:14:51,348
He knows me.

858
01:14:52,675 --> 01:14:54,586
He knows the demands of my work.

859
01:14:55,155 --> 01:14:56,827
You don't love him.

860
01:14:57,995 --> 01:14:59,508
He and I are the same.

861
01:15:02,035 --> 01:15:03,388
And I want that.

862
01:15:06,995 --> 01:15:10,670
And I want somebody who can
feel my hand when I touch him.

863
01:15:12,355 --> 01:15:13,913
But you can feel me.

864
01:15:14,195 --> 01:15:15,787
You felt me.

865
01:15:17,475 --> 01:15:19,113
I want to say goodbye.

866
01:15:21,315 --> 01:15:22,987
I don't want to see you again.

867
01:19:14,635 --> 01:19:15,954
Hey, buddy.

868
01:19:16,915 --> 01:19:18,314
You can't be in here.

869
01:19:19,155 --> 01:19:20,110
Do you see me?

870
01:19:21,955 --> 01:19:23,434
Do you see me?

871
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:25,194
Can you see me?

872
01:19:25,515 --> 01:19:26,584
We can see you.

873
01:19:28,475 --> 01:19:29,828
Is this blood?

874
01:19:30,115 --> 01:19:30,945
This is blood!

875
01:19:31,355 --> 01:19:32,470
Is it red?

876
01:19:32,995 --> 01:19:33,871
Red?

877
01:19:34,315 --> 01:19:35,464
Is it red?

878
01:19:36,835 --> 01:19:38,234
Color.

879
01:19:38,555 --> 01:19:40,511
What color were the drugs you took?

880
01:19:41,795 --> 01:19:43,069
Better get your butt out of here.

881
01:19:43,955 --> 01:19:45,024
You got somewhere to go?

882
01:19:48,835 --> 01:19:49,984
Maggie.

883
01:20:01,715 --> 01:20:04,434
Down and down and down I go

884
01:20:04,715 --> 01:20:06,831
Round and round and round I go

885
01:20:07,555 --> 01:20:09,113
Round and spin

886
01:20:09,395 --> 01:20:11,431
Loving the spin I'm in

887
01:20:11,755 --> 01:20:14,144
Loving that old black magic...

888
01:20:14,435 --> 01:20:16,312
...called love

889
01:20:17,755 --> 01:20:19,552
Love!

890
01:20:20,835 --> 01:20:21,950
Hi!

891
01:20:31,515 --> 01:20:34,712
I was wondering if you could tell me
how to get to the county hospital?

892
01:21:17,035 --> 01:21:18,150
Can I help you, sir?

893
01:21:18,395 --> 01:21:21,068
I'll just take a moment
to catch my breath.

894
01:21:22,075 --> 01:21:22,871
Breath!

895
01:21:26,235 --> 01:21:27,224
Maggie Rice.

896
01:21:28,915 --> 01:21:30,030
Are you a patient?

897
01:21:30,435 --> 01:21:31,948
No. I just need to find her, please.

898
01:21:32,355 --> 01:21:34,585
You'll have to call her office.
Someone there can help you.

899
01:21:35,235 --> 01:21:36,384
Do you know where she is?

900
01:21:37,155 --> 01:21:38,986
No, sir, I do not know where she is.

901
01:21:42,235 --> 01:21:43,793
You have this computer...

902
01:21:45,115 --> 01:21:47,071
...and all this technology.
Can't you look her up?

903
01:21:50,795 --> 01:21:51,944
Where's Maggie?

904
01:21:57,115 --> 01:21:58,707
So you're a friend of Maggie's?

905
01:22:00,795 --> 01:22:01,989
What happened to you?

906
01:22:02,315 --> 01:22:03,225
Sorry.

907
01:22:03,675 --> 01:22:04,744
It's okay.

908
01:22:07,755 --> 01:22:08,904
I fell.

909
01:22:09,395 --> 01:22:11,955
Evidently. Off a train?

910
01:22:12,875 --> 01:22:14,388
I fell in love.

911
01:22:21,475 --> 01:22:22,988
Please help me find her.

912
01:22:27,995 --> 01:22:31,192
She went to Lake Tahoe. Her uncle
has a cabin on the Nevada side.

913
01:22:31,515 --> 01:22:32,470
Wait!

914
01:23:02,795 --> 01:23:03,944
Cassiel.

915
01:23:04,875 --> 01:23:06,024
Are you there?

916
01:23:14,675 --> 01:23:15,551
Hello.

917
01:24:08,515 --> 01:24:09,709
Where you headed?

918
01:24:11,355 --> 01:24:12,185
Tahoe!

919
01:24:13,555 --> 01:24:14,704
Reno!

920
01:24:15,035 --> 01:24:16,070
Tahoe!

921
01:24:16,715 --> 01:24:17,989
I'm going to Reno.

922
01:24:18,355 --> 01:24:19,708
I'm going to Tahoe.

923
01:24:20,235 --> 01:24:22,544
Hop in. We'll figure it out
when we get there.

924
01:26:34,195 --> 01:26:35,674
Am I too late?

925
01:26:37,355 --> 01:26:38,310
Too late?

926
01:26:39,195 --> 01:26:40,264
Jordan?

927
01:26:44,515 --> 01:26:46,187
I couldn't marry Jordan.

928
01:26:49,395 --> 01:26:50,987
I'm in love with you.

929
01:26:58,835 --> 01:27:00,109
What happened?

930
01:27:03,435 --> 01:27:04,754
Free will.

931
01:27:19,315 --> 01:27:20,748
I feel you.

932
01:28:36,595 --> 01:28:37,994
Do you feel that?

933
01:28:38,355 --> 01:28:39,390
Yes.

934
01:28:41,315 --> 01:28:42,543
And that?

935
01:28:46,475 --> 01:28:49,148
How's it feel?
Tell me what it feels like.

936
01:28:50,155 --> 01:28:51,429
I can't.

937
01:28:53,395 --> 01:28:54,305
Try.

938
01:28:56,115 --> 01:28:57,230
Warm.

939
01:29:02,475 --> 01:29:03,703
Aching.

940
01:29:21,115 --> 01:29:22,309
It's okay.

941
01:29:25,035 --> 01:29:26,150
We fit together.

942
01:29:26,515 --> 01:29:27,470
I know.

943
01:29:28,235 --> 01:29:30,191
We were made to fit together.

944
01:29:50,875 --> 01:29:53,753
I always asked the dying what
they liked best about living.

945
01:29:56,355 --> 01:29:58,027
Wrote it down in my book.

946
01:30:00,475 --> 01:30:01,590
This is it.

947
01:30:03,155 --> 01:30:04,793
This is what I like best.

948
01:30:05,755 --> 01:30:07,791
You haven't even started yet.

949
01:30:08,555 --> 01:30:10,864
We have our whole lives together.

950
01:30:11,195 --> 01:30:12,344
You and me.

951
01:30:12,595 --> 01:30:14,472
Mr. and Mrs. Plate.

952
01:35:37,235 --> 01:35:39,112
-I'll get help.
-You're here.

953
01:35:39,795 --> 01:35:41,228
-Stay.
-I should get help.

954
01:35:41,475 --> 01:35:43,431
Don't go. The driver went.

955
01:35:43,675 --> 01:35:44,903
Please stay.

956
01:35:45,235 --> 01:35:47,032
Please stay with me.

957
01:35:47,795 --> 01:35:49,194
I'm scared.

958
01:35:53,715 --> 01:35:55,148
I screwed up.

959
01:35:56,515 --> 01:35:58,312
I wanted to show you everything.

960
01:35:58,755 --> 01:35:59,904
You will.

961
01:36:03,435 --> 01:36:06,029
You came all this way.

962
01:36:07,355 --> 01:36:08,788
I'm sorry.

963
01:36:09,835 --> 01:36:11,712
God, no, Maggie!

964
01:36:12,755 --> 01:36:14,029
To touch you...

965
01:36:14,275 --> 01:36:15,424
...and to feel you.

966
01:36:16,315 --> 01:36:19,193
To be able to hold your hand right now.

967
01:36:19,595 --> 01:36:20,710
You know what that means?

968
01:36:20,955 --> 01:36:23,515
Do you know how much I love you?

969
01:36:27,875 --> 01:36:29,866
Keep looking at me, okay?

970
01:36:31,435 --> 01:36:33,107
Look right in my eyes.

971
01:36:34,995 --> 01:36:36,633
Someone's out there.

972
01:36:38,555 --> 01:36:41,831
Don't look at them.
Please don't you look at them!

973
01:36:42,075 --> 01:36:43,554
Is this what happens?

974
01:36:50,395 --> 01:36:51,350
Yes.

975
01:36:57,595 --> 01:36:59,233
This is what happens.

976
01:37:03,515 --> 01:37:05,233
I'm not afraid.

977
01:37:09,155 --> 01:37:10,747
When they ask me...

978
01:37:12,755 --> 01:37:14,074
...what I liked the best...

979
01:37:16,315 --> 01:37:17,430
...I'll tell them...

980
01:37:17,755 --> 01:37:19,154
...it was you.

981
01:37:48,075 --> 01:37:49,110
God!

982
01:39:47,635 --> 01:39:50,024
I can't see you,
but I know you're there.

983
01:39:52,475 --> 01:39:53,590
I'm sorry.

984
01:39:57,235 --> 01:39:58,384
Get out.

985
01:40:00,915 --> 01:40:03,383
Was it you? Were you the one?
Were you there?

986
01:40:03,955 --> 01:40:04,831
No.

987
01:40:06,035 --> 01:40:07,184
Why did He do this?

988
01:40:07,475 --> 01:40:08,430
I don't know.

989
01:40:08,675 --> 01:40:09,790
Because her number was up?

990
01:40:10,955 --> 01:40:12,513
What do you want me to say?

991
01:40:19,955 --> 01:40:22,992
-Am I being punished?
-You know better than that.

992
01:40:24,595 --> 01:40:26,153
That's life.

993
01:40:27,875 --> 01:40:28,990
You're living now.

994
01:40:30,835 --> 01:40:31,790
And one day...

995
01:40:32,435 --> 01:40:33,709
...you'll be dying.

996
01:40:40,235 --> 01:40:41,224
What's it like?

997
01:40:42,515 --> 01:40:43,391
What?

998
01:40:44,475 --> 01:40:45,430
Warmth.

999
01:40:47,635 --> 01:40:48,954
It's wonderful.

1000
01:40:50,995 --> 01:40:53,065
If you'd known this was going to happen...

1001
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:55,943
...would you have done it?

1002
01:41:01,835 --> 01:41:03,712
I would rather have had...

1003
01:41:05,395 --> 01:41:07,192
...one breath of her hair...

1004
01:41:10,795 --> 01:41:12,513
...one kiss of her mouth...

1005
01:41:15,475 --> 01:41:17,431
...one touch of her hand...

1006
01:41:19,555 --> 01:41:21,625
...than an eternity without it.

1007
01:41:24,595 --> 01:41:25,584
One.
