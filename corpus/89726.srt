1
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,716
I gotta go to my car.

2
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,271
- You're kidding me, right?
- No... I'm sorry, man.

3
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,318
I'll be right back.

4
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,197
He's all right. Pencil pushers just
ain't used to getting their hands dirty.

5
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,713
Your boy's green.

6
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,589
He's a government lackey, but his
information's solid, man. The best.

7
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,751
In fact...

8
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,510
...I gotta go up on my finder's fee.

9
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,118
Your boy's gonna leave the scene, and
you're gonna hit me up for a bump?

10
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,112
It's only fair I get my cut.

11
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,154
Our business is done, for good.

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,190
Hey, don't fucking do that, man.

13
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,509
Don't ever fucking
lay your hands on me again!

14
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,235
Oh, shit.

15
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,991
Reyes!

16
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,719
Reyes.

17
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,392
Reyes.

18
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,071
B, pick up the fucking phone!

19
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,034
Hey, Jared, let me get a beer...

20
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,159
...and a Long Island Iced Tea.
- Gotcha.

21
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,994
Yeah!

22
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,952
Come on, baby.
Don't be mad at me.

23
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,874
Come on, it's just a game, partner.
It's just a game, dog.

24
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,271
But I'm gonna beat that ass one day.

25
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,874
I like that about you.
You did your best, dog.

26
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,270
You know, keep practicing. Go on.

27
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,271
- Hey, be good, baby.
- All right, now.

28
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,271
- Hey, hey, sexy woman, you in here?
- So did you win again?

29
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,318
Come on, now. I own that court.
You know I did my thing.

30
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,119
- Em, we're late.
- Okay, I'm gonna be right on you.

31
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,669
But I had to whup Ray's butt
one more time.

32
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,759
Yeah, I figured.
Your tux is in the closet, all right?

33
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,353
- I got an idea about that tuxedo thing.
- You do?

34
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,395
I think I'm gonna rock my baby-blue
Jordans with it. What you think?

35
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,630
You are not wearing Jordans
with a tux!

36
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,354
I promise you, it will be sexy, girl.
I promise.

37
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,638
He just loves to drive me crazy.

38
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,509
Emery Simms. Emery?

39
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,829
It is so easy to push
my baby's buttons.

40
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,953
- How easy?
- This easy.

41
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,279
You smell a little funky.

42
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,079
Please. You love my funky ass
and you know this.

43
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,915
Yeah, I do.
Now, could you please hurry?

44
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,636
Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight is an exciting evening.

45
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,557
I'm proud to add yet another restaurant
to Atlanta's A list of fine dining.

46
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,668
And I'm truly honoured that you chose
to join us tonight in celebration.

47
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,037
So from the bottom of my heart,
I thank you for coming.

48
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,714
Now, my mother taught me
that privilege...

49
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,438
...is a privilege.

50
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,354
So in homage to her, I declare
that for the life of this restaurant...

51
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,275
...five percent of our revenue will be
donated to the Youth Advocacy Centre.

52
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,515
Thank you. Thank you.

53
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,352
Thank you so much.

54
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,398
This project is nearest and dearest
to my wife's heart.

55
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,949
If I may, I'd like to introduce
my wife to you.

56
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,554
The very beautiful, the very sexy...

57
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,913
...my baby, Mrs. Constance Simms.

58
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,079
Come on, now.
Tell me I made you proud.

59
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,708
Okay, if I have to.

60
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,032
Listen, you snatched up
that Niskey Lake property just in time.

61
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,952
If I'd had my ear to the ground...

62
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,588
...maybe you and I both
would've made a killing.

63
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,752
- Or better yet, just me.
- Maybe next time.

64
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,312
Hey, sweetie. Enjoy, ladies.

65
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,516
How you doing tonight?

66
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,476
What's going on?

67
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,078
We have uninvited guests.

68
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,398
A lot of shit in here.

69
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,039
- What is this?
- I don't know.

70
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,471
Look at this sad plaque,
probably bought it for himself.

71
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,631
- Are we finding anything interesting?
- Mr. Simms.

72
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,354
That's me.

73
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,559
I'm Detective Pierce. This is Detective
Morgan. Atlanta Police Department.

74
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,280
- Nice office.
- Thank you. I find it comfortable.

75
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,398
Raymond Wallace, Mr. Simms'
attorney. What's this about?

76
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,869
We wanted to ask your client
some questions.

77
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,077
- Like if he knew a Kenneth Stroud.
- Stroud.

78
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,431
I'm sorry, doesn't ring a bell.

79
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,996
You know what? Don't worry about it.
Happens to me all the time.

80
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,118
I never remember names,
but I'm always good with faces.

81
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,670
What about that, huh? Look familiar?

82
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,153
- Wow.
- Yeah. He's dead.

83
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,476
Indeed he is.

84
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,071
Well, that look familiar to you?

85
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,236
No. Not really.

86
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,392
No or not really?

87
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,834
No, detective.

88
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,077
We found a phone
next to the dead guy.

89
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,829
And it had your number
in the recent call list.

90
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,473
Well, that's interesting.

91
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,758
But isn't it possible that he could've
just called the wrong number?

92
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,077
Incoming recent calls.

93
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,798
I'm sorry. Did I forget that?

94
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,355
Isn't it possible I called
the wrong number?

95
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,432
Is my client being charged
with a crime, detective?

96
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,108
No, we're just trying to get
questions answered.

97
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,034
- Trying to get some clarity here.
- I'm one who does appreciate clarity.

98
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,475
But I apologize,
I can't help you with this.

99
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,591
You can tell us where you were...

100
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,036
We apologize for interrupting
your lovely party.

101
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,919
- Thank you for your time, Mr. Simms.
- My pleasure.

102
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,112
I do need to attend to my guests.

103
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,239
If you could leave me my pen and take
these pictures, I'd appreciate that.

104
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,231
Yes, of course.

105
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,390
- Thanks.
- Mr. Wallace.

106
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,871
Hey. What was that all about?

107
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,399
We need to talk.

108
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,230
Emery, you're not even listening.

109
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,796
I am listening to you.
I'm just tired, so please don't start.

110
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,157
If your five-percent pledge
had really come from your heart...

111
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,594
...it'd be different.

112
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,638
What is the problem?
This could work out in your favour.

113
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,678
- Or it could backfire.
- Wait. Just listen to me.

114
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,991
The restaurant does well,
that's a donation for your cause.

115
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,596
So you use the youth centre
to cast yourself in a better light?

116
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,230
- Connie, you're panicking.
- Don't patronize me, Emery.

117
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,674
I know the police came
to visit you tonight.

118
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,434
You wanna tell me
what that's all about?

119
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,631
Yeah.

120
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,957
Good night.

121
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,118
Oh, Ray, you are stupid.

122
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,519
Excuse me, sweetheart.

123
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,632
- This might sound a little corny, but...
- Yeah, I know.

124
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,117
You know me from someplace.

125
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,590
- Other night, at your restaurant.
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.

126
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,756
That's right, at the opening.

127
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,310
Well, I don't think we ever got
formally introduced, now, did we?

128
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,951
- Allannah James.
- Emery Simms.

129
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,630
How is it we ended up running
into each other twice in one week?

130
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,914
I was interviewing for a position
at the tennis club.

131
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,676
As for the restaurant, well, you know,
ain't a party in Atlanta I can't get into.

132
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,957
- Oh, is that right?
- That's right. Trust me.

133
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,515
Okay. I think I like
your little style there.

134
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,195
- That's good.
- Yeah.

135
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,157
I think I like that a lot.

136
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,713
Well, here we are.

137
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,152
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Wait a minute.

138
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,831
Just in case you ever find yourself
in need again.

139
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,111
Thank you...

140
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,631
...again.

141
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,837
Come in.

142
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,278
Russell's on line two,
I rescheduled lunch with Aaron...

143
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,318
...and there's an urgent message
from the printer.

144
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,391
Thanks, Anna.

145
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,870
He has another function that evening.
No way he'll make both.

146
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,715
These are underprivileged kids who've
managed to refocus their anger...

147
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,632
...into something constructive.

148
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,713
Surely the mayor can take the time
to honour that kind of dedication.

149
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,235
It's a recital, Constance.

150
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,755
It's an exhibition.

151
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,908
- Say what you're not saying, Russ.
- It's election year, sweetheart.

152
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,634
And your husband's
business dealings...

153
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,559
...don't exactly bring pride
to your family name.

154
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,390
I am not my husband. And he
has nothing to do with the centre.

155
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,836
Right. Five-percent donations aside,
of course.

156
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,477
Thank you.

157
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,560
- Cell phone IDs are in.
- And?

158
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,156
And seems as though our Mr. Stroud
was a busy bee.

159
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,312
He's been in touch
with the big house and Capitol Hill.

160
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,717
Well, were the calls spread out
or made all over the same day?

161
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,356
Looks like all on the same day,
except for two.

162
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,640
Simms and a Mark Reyes,
a numbers guy for the congressman.

163
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,592
Let me see that.

164
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,158
This coffee is shitty.

165
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,279
Well, the duration of the call to Simms
was five minutes and some change.

166
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,831
- So much for it being a wrong number.
- Time for a field trip. Let's roll.

167
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,915
Morning.

168
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,991
- What the hell was that?
- Payback.

169
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,953
Letrice is not happy about
your late-night creeping.

170
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,112
Okay, first of all,
nobody is creeping.

171
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,439
She's already freaked out
over this living situation.

172
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,830
You gotta be more considerate.
This ain't...

173
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,713
Yeah, yeah, I know.
This ain't Greenville. Got it.

174
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,838
Help me with this necklace,
smart-ass.

175
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,229
I got more assets than my ass,
you know.

176
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,234
Well, then, use them to help you get
to the bus station. I'm running late.

177
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,595
- Pick up.
- Okay.

178
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,355
You know, two in a bed,
riding on the bus.

179
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,988
- Sure this ain't Greenville?
- You are so stupid.

180
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,397
- Package for you, Mr. Simms.
- Thank you, Jamie.

181
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,238
Oh, no, she didn't.

182
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,512
This is Allannah James.
How can I help you?

183
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,679
Help me understand how a little
paperweight can have a large impact.

184
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,070
- Did you like it?
- Oh, yeah.

185
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,835
- Yeah, I like it a lot. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

186
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,554
Emery?

187
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,839
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm here. I'm here.

188
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,836
Hey, listen.

189
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,670
I want you to have dinner
with me tonight.

190
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,110
Now, why would I want to do that?

191
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,998
And why wouldn't you do that?

192
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,516
I don't know.
Press says you a dangerous man.

193
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,792
You don't strike me as the type
of woman who scares easily.

194
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,519
- I don't?
- Baby, just have dinner with me.

195
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,518
Sheila's, downtown. It's on Ponce.
Parking's in the rear.

196
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,193
I'll make the reservation.

197
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,874
- What up, player?
- Hey.

198
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,591
Yo. I'm about to take a ride, so I don't
have to worry about anything, right?

199
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,752
I'm the manager, right?
Let me manage, you control freak.

200
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,912
Hey, hey. My bad. My bad.
I guess old habits die hard.

201
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,197
- Handle your business, player.
- Thank you, my brother.

202
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,028
- I'm with you tonight, all right?
- You're with me?

203
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,154
Got it.

204
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,880
- All right. Make that money, player.
- Come on, now.

205
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,393
You do look very nice tonight.

206
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,038
Thank you...

207
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,191
...again.

208
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,915
What was that?

209
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,514
Come on, now. Speak on.

210
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,359
You know, this could be
very, very wrong.

211
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,592
Meaning?

212
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,991
Meaning, my mama
didn't raise me like this.

213
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,833
Emery, you are very much
a married man...

214
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,357
...and I don't want you thinking of me
in that way.

215
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,516
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.
It's a little too late for that.

216
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,474
Besides, your mama can't be too mad.
We're just having dinner, right?

217
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,477
- Well, hey, baby.
- Hey.

218
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,437
I didn't think you'd still be up.

219
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,478
Just trying to get a jump-start
on tomorrow.

220
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,110
What about you? It's late.

221
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,918
Yeah, I know it is, baby.

222
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,072
We had a really good turnout
at the restaurant tonight.

223
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,515
Despite the bad press,
people still showed.

224
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,033
Good for you.

225
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,875
A lot of my heavy hitters have backed
out of attending the exhibition.

226
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,918
Without them, no funding.

227
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,078
Connie, I'm sorry.

228
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,596
I really thought they'd leave you
and the centre out of all this.

229
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,637
Yeah.

230
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,758
That's exactly what you thought.

231
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,715
What's up, Lannie?

232
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,956
- What are you doing here, Derrick?
- Looking for you.

233
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,759
You ain't made that too easy,
dipping out of state.

234
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,111
We don't have no more business
with each other, okay?

235
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,717
I don't have it.

236
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,950
Maybe you need to cash
in your scholarship.

237
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,635
I don't go here.
I'm just crashing with a friend.

238
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,279
Well...

239
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,876
...I'm willing to take a down payment,
as usual.

240
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,878
Those days are over.

241
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,591
You get me my money.

242
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,990
Or them days'll be back.

243
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,235
- To winning the case.
- To winning the case.

244
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,034
Look at them, man.

245
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,951
They think they're being funny.

246
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,475
Cops don't drink Hpnotiq.
I should sue them.

247
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,756
And give the press another story?

248
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,797
They've got nothing.

249
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,430
If Reyes was gonna talk,
he'd have talked.

250
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,639
And if Ren and Stimpy over there want
to play stakeout, what do you care?

251
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,793
- I don't like being mocked, Brandon.
- Ray said wait it out.

252
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,315
All right? So keep your cool.

253
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,074
Come on.

254
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,391
We've got some customers
to satisfy, all right?

255
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,195
- Yeah.
- He's sweating me.

256
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,914
Sure is.

257
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,196
She has got to go.

258
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,756
- And I will do it no longer.
- She's cool. All you have to do is...

259
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,759
I know it's late.

260
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,229
You know what, Allannah?
I'm in school.

261
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,073
And I have classes. Early ones.

262
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,028
I was not tripping about you staying
here. But you know what?

263
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,795
It was as long as we had our own
space, and you respected the fact...

264
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,110
...that folks have got to get
some sleep.

265
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,279
For the past couple of weeks,
you have been strolling in here...

266
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,472
...at 2 and 3:00 in the morning
consistently.

267
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,036
Okay, Letrice, whoa. I get it.

268
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,909
I'm not trying to be funny right now.
But you got it before tonight.

269
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,272
You know what? You don't need
to talk to me like I'm a 5-year-old.

270
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,749
I am a grown-ass woman.

271
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,189
You need to get your grown ass
and find someplace else to sleep.

272
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,115
Yeah, Emery Simms.

273
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,838
Okay, hey, hey, whoa.

274
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,996
Slow down, baby, slow down.
Slow down.

275
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,515
Just talk to me. What happened?

276
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,676
Okay. All right. Listen to me.

277
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,559
You tell me where you are,
and I will be right there.

278
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,037
Hey.

279
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,952
So this is where you live?

280
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,556
It's just temporary
till I get back on my feet.

281
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,277
- Look, I can't let you stay here.
- Emery, I'm fine.

282
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,714
- You're fine?
- Yeah.

283
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,876
Really. Then why'd you call me?

284
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,391
Listen.

285
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,075
I have a few vacant properties.
You can stay till things get better.

286
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,435
- All right?
- No.

287
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,153
- No?
- No.

288
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,756
I insist.

289
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,595
Hey. Look at me.

290
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,832
We'll just call it a loan.

291
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,117
No strings.

292
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,192
- No strings?
- No strings.

293
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,999
- Okay.
- Yeah?

294
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,037
Yeah?

295
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,395
That's my girl.

296
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,192
Yeah. Yeah.

297
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,275
You know, there ought to be a law
against somebody being this good.

298
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,274
I did my homework on that number
you found over at Stroud's place.

299
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,159
- What'd you come up with?
- It's an offshore account.

300
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,193
- Any money?
- How does half a million dollars sound?

301
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,952
- That's good.
- Thought so.

302
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,436
And the bulk of it was wired over
in stock transactions.

303
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,517
You run the stock transactions.

304
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,434
Find out which companies he invested
in for how much. Can you do that?

305
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,434
Okay. I think I see where you're going
with that.

306
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,313
Be right back. I'm getting on it.
Hey, Tamika.

307
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,754
Oh, shit.

308
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,596
So...

309
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,671
...what you think?

310
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,956
Allannah, you are kidding me.

311
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,958
- You like it?
- Hello.

312
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,515
Well, we're still
working some things out.

313
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,069
Like the security gate buzzer
keeps breaking...

314
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,959
...and we're still figuring out
our décor.

315
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,750
We? You sound like you're
setting up house with this man.

316
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,117
- Are you thirsty?
- What you got?

317
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,676
Orange juice, Coke or wine.

318
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,116
- Wine.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

319
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,397
- Gotta be old money, right?
- What do you mean?

320
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,030
Allannah, look at this place.
This can't just be restaurant money.

321
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,079
What difference does it make?
It's temporary.

322
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,071
Here.

323
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,514
Small hole in the condom,
and it doesn't have to be.

324
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,871
Gwennie, you were the one who said,
"This ain't Greenville anymore." Right?

325
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,633
Tell me you haven't thought about it.

326
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,315
Drink your drink. You're much more fun
when you're buzzed.

327
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,150
Hey, it's Reyes.
I'm getting out of town.

328
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,308
But I know where to get some cash
before I go.

329
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,832
B, let it go. I'll give you
another chance to lose again.

330
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,073
You know I let you win so you could
look good in front of your friends.

331
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,276
- Okay, whatever, player.
- Yeah, right.

332
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,152
Yo, what's that?

333
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,910
This is Reyes.

334
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,594
The motherfucker
wants some money.

335
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,276
I'm sorry, but you gotta give
the guy points for creativity.

336
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,712
A Swiss bank account number
on a Swiss Alps postcard, that's balls.

337
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,519
B, this shit right here
means he's gonna talk.

338
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,830
He talks, he loses everything.

339
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,515
Look, he was there that night,
all right?

340
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,194
How's he gonna explain that?

341
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,354
The only way he can get you...
The only way is if you let him.

342
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,909
No, man. You know what,
I'll just pay him off.

343
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,230
Give him money,
make it go away forever.

344
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,039
Sometimes I think
you got too much damn money.

345
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,476
If you want to just give it away,
shit, give me some.

346
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,030
- You don't think I should pay him off?
- Hell, no.

347
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,352
As a matter of fact,
give me the fucking postcard.

348
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,513
Go on. All right? Don't sweat it.

349
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,352
All right. All right, it's done.

350
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,629
- You're lying.
- Shut up. You always do this.

351
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,431
You always say this.
And he's like, "Shut up."

352
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,036
Hey, baby.

353
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,434
That's Em. This is Gwen.

354
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,239
- Say hi.
- Hi.

355
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,912
Nice to meet you, Gwen.

356
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,512
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
You want some wine?

357
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,079
I don't think there's any left,
Allannah.

358
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,998
Maybe I should go, because...

359
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,311
Yeah, maybe you should
wait outside.

360
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,517
- I'm gonna drink a bottle of wine.
- Okay.

361
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,109
- You having fun, Allannah?
- Yeah.

362
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,877
Do you really think it's smart
to parade people through here?

363
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,992
Emery, she's not "people."

364
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,390
She's my friend.

365
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,599
What, do I need to get permission
to have friends over now, huh?

366
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,788
What's wrong, baby?

367
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,478
Nothing. Nothing's wrong, Allannah.

368
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:25,036
- Baby, I'm trying to help.
- I don't really want your help, Allannah.

369
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,831
Then why are you here?

370
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,436
Yeah, Morgan.

371
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:10,239
Well, does anybody have any idea
on where he may have gone?

372
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,918
Okay. All right.
Well, keep me posted.

373
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,836
Well, looks like our friend
Mark Reyes is missing.

374
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,513
Nobody's seen him in days.

375
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,235
That's right around the time
that Stroud was murdered, right?

376
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,272
- Yeah.
- Look at these people.

377
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,156
Maybe we're chasing the wrong guy.

378
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,831
Maybe you're right.

379
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,429
- This came by messenger.
- Anything else come?

380
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,919
- No, that's it.
- Oh, okay.

381
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:54,392
Listen, I'm going over to the Alliance.
If Emery calls, tell him I'm running late.

382
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,313
Oh, he called
while you were on with Russell.

383
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,352
- What did he say?
- Excuse me?

384
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,476
I said, what did he say?

385
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,949
He said that he'll be late.

386
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,074
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. Thanks.

387
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,159
Hey, shorty,
where your fucking boss at?

388
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,718
Pushy-ass people up in here.
Hey, where the manager at?

389
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,952
- Who in charge here?
- How can I help you? I'm the manager.

390
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,351
You? Why don't you help yourself
to some breath mints.

391
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,033
And go get your fucking boss.

392
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,230
- Why don't you see if I can help you?
- I don't wanna talk to you.

393
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,470
- Get out of my face.
- What's the problem?

394
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,717
- I'm the owner. Can I help you?
- Pretty boy. You the owner.

395
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,751
Yeah, I'm the owner.

396
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,874
Get your hands up off me.
Get off me!

397
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,393
What you gonna...?

398
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,319
- Emery!
- Get him out of here!

399
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,391
I ain't feel that, pretty boy.

400
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,074
You just stay the fuck away
from Allannah!

401
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,755
What in the hell
are you doing here, Derrick?

402
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,956
This is a phat crib, Allannah.

403
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,429
They do a credit check on you?

404
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,229
- How did you get this address?
- You know what's funny?

405
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,672
Just the other day you crying broke...

406
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,030
...but today you can afford all this.

407
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,112
- It's a friend's.
- I had a talk with that friend.

408
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,476
What kind of talk?

409
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,789
Man-to-man talk.

410
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,749
You better not have hurt him.

411
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,318
- He got you thinking brand-new?
- Get your hands off me.

412
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,756
- I want in. I want in on the con.
- This is not about the money.

413
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,037
- It's always about the money.
- This is different.

414
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,832
Why?

415
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,230
Dude got you laced?

416
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,960
You're nothing but a piece of ass
for him up here.

417
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,509
You on-call booty. Okay, Allannah?

418
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,275
- Just more decoration for his condo.
- I love him.

419
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,870
I love him in a way
that I will never love you.

420
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,079
You're not my husband anymore.
We're not partners in life anymore.

421
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,832
Which means...

422
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,195
...I don't owe you shit.

423
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,872
You always did have
too much mouth.

424
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,152
You owe me money.
I'll get it out your ass or your pocket...

425
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,709
...but either way,
I'm gonna get my money.

426
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,959
And you're gonna pay me
for as long as I say you will.

427
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,718
- Here you go. I got you an ice pack.
- It's fine.

428
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,155
- Quit trying to be brave.
- I don't need it.

429
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,311
- It's gonna swell...
- Are you listening?

430
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,199
This is just a little cut, so let it go.

431
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,631
Connie.

432
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,274
- Baby, I can't do this tonight.
- Do what, Emery?

433
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,193
What? Some man attacks you
out of the clear blue...

434
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,432
...and I'm the only concerned one.
- He didn't attack me.

435
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,639
He just punched me. I walked up from
behind him so he would've hit anybody.

436
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,796
- What if he comes back?
- He won't.

437
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,349
- How do you know?
- Because he has no reason to.

438
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,193
You don't even know
why he came this time, Emery.

439
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,830
Connie, some punk came off the street
making a bunch of noise.

440
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,639
He could've been drunk,
he could've been high.

441
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,873
But the bottom line is I'm fine.
So let's just drop it.

442
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,871
You know what?

443
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:07,233
I'm sick and tired of being a wife to a
man who doesn't wanna be a husband.

444
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,119
- Connie, come on.
- Do you have to control everything?

445
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,636
Even the way I love you?
If it's not your way, then hell with it.

446
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,439
- Even with the damn ice pack.
- I said I was sorry.

447
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:21,515
Would you stop apologizing?
I'm getting so sick of your apologies.

448
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,717
After the 100th time,
they start to lose a little meaning.

449
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,948
- Woman, what do you want me to do?
- I want you to stop!

450
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,155
Just stop doing things that you're
gonna have to be sorry for later.

451
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,959
Just...

452
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,758
...stop.

453
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,552
Who is he?

454
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,032
Old drama.

455
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,549
How did old drama
become new drama, Allannah?

456
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,038
I don't know.

457
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,158
You sure about that?

458
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,152
You trying to say something?

459
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,834
I'm saying he knew
exactly where to find me.

460
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,389
- He came to my business.
- He found both of us.

461
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,233
- Well, how?
- I told you. I don't know.

462
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,829
Well, I need you to think
and think real hard.

463
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,116
I'm sorry, brother.

464
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,510
- Do you care about you or me?
- Jesus Christ!

465
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,793
Do you understand that I have
a hell of a lot to fucking lose?

466
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,914
Do you?

467
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,517
Shit.

468
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,153
What is this to you?

469
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,518
If I knew the answer to that, I'd be
the man I always dreamed of being.

470
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,909
That may be the first real thing
we have in common.

471
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,916
It's late, Allannah.

472
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,429
You don't have to go.

473
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,991
Look.

474
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,909
Stay. You stay as long
as you need to.

475
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,709
You just put the key in my corporate
office when you're ready to go.

476
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,473
Hey, baby, baby, baby.

477
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,676
Yeah, there she is.

478
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,956
Rise and shine.

479
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,754
- Good morning to you.
- Morning.

480
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,030
See, me?

481
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,194
I'm the type of man who believes
rainy days should be spent indoors.

482
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,076
Whoa, whoa.
Close your eyes, baby.

483
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,074
You don't see that. You don't see that.
That is all still a dream, baby.

484
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,671
Okay. Now you can open them.

485
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,913
I promise you it's raining out there,
all right? I want you to check this out.

486
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,390
Oh, yeah. You like that, don't you?
That's kind of nice, right?

487
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,876
What is this?

488
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,871
This...

489
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,119
...is just a little ambience
for my beautiful wife.

490
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,996
- I have work to do, Emery.
- Okay, okay. Hey, hey, hey.

491
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,154
- Just go in a little late today, that's all.
- I can't. L...

492
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,598
Baby...

493
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,716
...last night...

494
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,156
...I heard you.

495
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,551
Oh, hey, hey.
Look at me, look at me. Please.

496
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,031
Baby, I'm serious.

497
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,236
I heard you.

498
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,672
And I promise you,
from this moment forward...

499
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,910
...no more apologies.

500
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,392
Come here.

501
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,631
- Hey, there's my baby.
- Hey, you.

502
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,677
Hey, so listen.

503
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,231
How do you feel about your man
taking his wife to lunch today?

504
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,152
- What do you say?
- You better.

505
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,833
That's right.

506
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,558
- I've got to go, boy.
- You better be ready for me, girl.

507
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,439
Oh, no, Allannah. I can't do this.

508
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,915
Okay, now that's just rude.

509
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,479
Hi.

510
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,594
- Here I am.
- Have you lost your mind?

511
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,957
- This is my house.
- What did you think, Emery?

512
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,557
That if you stop answering your
cell phone, that I would just go away?

513
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,877
- Emery?
- Hey. Hey, baby. What happened?

514
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,396
- Did you forget something?
- This was wedged in my car door.

515
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,313
It's got your name on it,
but that's it.

516
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,756
No address. Not even postage.

517
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,152
Let me see.

518
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,519
You know we've been getting a lot of
strange things since that bad press.

519
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:41,713
- This is probably one of those things.
- But at our house? It's kind of scary.

520
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,191
Well, Connie, anybody on the Internet
can get an address.

521
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,191
Hey.

522
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,640
- All right?
- Okay. I'm gonna get to work.

523
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,268
- Lunch?
- Lunch.

524
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,238
- Lunch.
- I'm coming to get you.

525
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,314
You're really cute with the wifey.

526
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,993
You are.

527
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,357
- Why are you avoiding me?
- I'll tell you why I'm avoiding you.

528
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,717
- Because I'm working on my marriage.
- You said you needed me!

529
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,438
No, I didn't.

530
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,993
Did you feel that way
when you were inside me?

531
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,833
Don't touch me.
Okay, woman, don't make this ugly.

532
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,031
This has always been ugly.

533
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,831
Don't you care?

534
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,190
Don't you care, Emery,
that I love you?

535
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,153
- Get off me. Wait a minute. You what?
- I love you.

536
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,993
You love me? Grow up, Allannah.

537
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:48,391
Listen to me.
We don't have a life together.

538
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,951
We have sex together.
We fuck, Allannah. All right?

539
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:57,033
I never said I was leaving Connie. And
you never asked me to. You know why?

540
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,676
Because everything you ever wanted
out of this between us you got.

541
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,758
Girl, I handed it right to you.

542
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:08,793
We both took advantage of each other,
so don't start playing violins on me.

543
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,951
It's desperate.

544
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,919
I think you're a little more
creative than that.

545
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,028
- What do we got?
- Dead lawyer making millions...

546
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,715
...off of insider trading scams.
- He was probably very good at it.

547
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,793
But maybe he was trying to be better.
Get bigger companies, and for that...

548
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,793
...he would need a lot more cash.
- Yeah.

549
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,270
That is where Simms comes in.
Let me ask you a question.

550
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:54,353
What's one of the biggest corporations
in America? Don't say Microsoft.

551
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,550
- Federal government?
- Bingo.

552
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,309
So you have a corrupt numbers guy
working at a congressman's office.

553
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,596
How much information
could he give you?

554
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,870
Oh, so you're saying Reyes...

555
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:10,079
...was to supply Stroud
with information for Simms.

556
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,994
So he could buy into a subsidized
government company.

557
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:18,113
- Exactly. But something went wrong.
- Yeah. Dead wrong.

558
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,715
Can you pencil me in
for dinner tonight?

559
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,717
No restaurant business tonight?

560
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,878
No. I promise you
I'm all yours if you'll have me.

561
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:30,238
- Then I'll see you for dinner then.
- All right, baby. Bye.

562
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,677
Don't get all weird.
Nobody's stalking you.

563
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,436
I just need to talk to you.

564
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,238
So talk, Allannah.

565
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,510
I'm pregnant.

566
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,389
You can follow me to the bathroom
or we can do it right here.

567
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,670
I'm not lying.

568
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,717
You're pregnant?

569
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,958
Allannah, why didn't you tell me
this before?

570
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,519
I don't know, Emery.
Maybe I was too busy growing up.

571
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,076
Okay. What do you want from me?
Do you want money?

572
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,675
If you want me to kill it.

573
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:19,231
Do you want me to kill it?

574
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,874
This doesn't have
anything to do with me.

575
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,911
I know. You're right.

576
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,991
This is about us.

577
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,551
I'll get you the money.

578
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,959
"I know he's here, Russell.

579
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,709
Because as much as I adore you...

580
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,677
...you are not my only in.

581
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,229
And I do intend to see Mayor Bailey...

582
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,676
...today."

583
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,237
Ten minutes later, I was in his office.

584
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,878
That right there is how you make
it happen in this game.

585
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,589
- The mayor's coming to the exhibition?
- Ain't that what I just said?

586
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,991
Well, all right.
Congratulations, Connie.

587
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,470
- Welcome to the big leagues.
- Welcome to the big leagues?

588
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,517
Well, ain't that what I just said?

589
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,311
Is that it?

590
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:32,514
Woman, don't ever test me like that.
Get your fine self over here.

591
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,877
I know the great Emery Simms
can do much better than that.

592
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,996
Yes, I can.

593
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,589
- What's up?
- What's up.

594
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,510
- Busy?
- No, just cleaning up, man.

595
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:48,878
- Trying to get all this stuff moved in.
- This is how you spend your days off?

596
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:53,278
Nope. Normally I'm doing overtime
for my pain-in-the-ass boss.

597
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,869
You got jokes?
That ain't funny, bro.

598
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,119
- Here you go.
- What do you want me to do with that?

599
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,078
No spectators. Get to work.
You can start right there.

600
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,596
- Oh, you tripping. You know that, right?
- Yep.

601
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,671
What the hell is all this mess anyway?

602
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,555
Trash or treasure, my brother.
Today's mission is to figure out which.

603
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:26,431
Oh, hell, no. This isn't what I think it...
I thought you burned this a long time...

604
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,068
What are you doing
holding on to this, man?

605
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,470
Memories, baby.

606
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,438
Eighty-seven.

607
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,272
Oh, wait a minute.

608
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,192
Hey, bro.

609
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,551
You was one funny-Iooking cat
back in the day. Damn.

610
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,354
- They say we looked alike.
- Whatever. That is why...

611
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:48,718
...you stayed a virgin in school.
- That's all right. That's all right.

612
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,992
Look at that.

613
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,958
Oh, Connie.

614
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,954
It's all under control now, right?

615
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,634
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, everything's cool.

616
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,473
- Allannah's going to the clinic Monday.
- You going?

617
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,791
No. Hell, no.
She doesn't want me to go.

618
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,315
Oh, you don't wanna go
anyway, man.

619
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,955
Abortions don't always
solve the problem.

620
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,479
What?

621
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,436
Man, we all got one who got away.

622
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,991
- Who?
- Why you all up in my Kool-Aid for?

623
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,948
- I don't tell you everything.
- That's bullshit. I tell you my business.

624
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,315
You're sensitive.
You a punk sometimes.

625
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,596
Whatever with you.

626
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,637
Hey, B.

627
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,996
This shit's getting crazy, man.

628
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,515
I don't know, man. I'm looking
for peace, you know what I'm saying?

629
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,553
From Reyes, from Allannah.

630
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,393
I mean, I just need some damn peace.

631
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,913
Hey, if the guy's causing you
that much trouble...

632
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:01,949
...$250,000 for your peace of mind,
maybe you should just pay him off.

633
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,758
Yeah.

634
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,755
Yeah, maybe I should.

635
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,512
Hey, look...

636
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,598
...I'm gonna bounce.
- Where you going?

637
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,394
I'm gonna go home.

638
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:23,354
- You just gonna bail on me like that.
- Hell, yeah. Watch.

639
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,832
See. I knew you was
just about yourself. It's all right.

640
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,231
It's nice.

641
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,318
What's nice, baby?

642
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,995
Just making some final decisions
on pieces for the exhibition.

643
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,752
Yeah?

644
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,791
I have a piece.

645
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,757
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.

646
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,831
Roses are red

647
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,071
This is original.

648
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,511
Violets are blue

649
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:05,149
- And I'm a terrible poet.
- Oh, you got that right.

650
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,194
But in spite of everything, Connie...

651
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,910
...know that I love you.

652
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,397
Hey.

653
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,031
Hi.

654
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,710
I didn't do it.

655
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:17,874
Emery. I know. I know
that you're not only with me for sex.

656
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:22,233
I know that, and the baby
is proof of that.

657
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,353
And it's worth more than the cost
of an abortion.

658
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,353
I'm gonna say this to you one time.

659
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:37,828
You cannot roll with the big dogs, so
don't play this bullshit game with me.

660
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,478
Emery, I rolled around
with the biggest dog of them all.

661
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,352
You don't scare me.

662
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,916
You get your little trifling ass
out of my condo, you hear me?

663
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,834
As of right now, you are out of my life.
You never fucking existed.

664
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,631
Emery.

665
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,030
Emery, I'm sorry.

666
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,630
Goodbye, Allannah.

667
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,353
Emery!

668
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:10,799
Emery, baby, I'm sorry.
I don't know what I'm saying.

669
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,276
Emery!

670
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,389
I'm not a bad person.

671
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,398
I'm not even a mean person.

672
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:26,035
Because even with what you think
you know...

673
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:31,719
...about me,
you don't really "know me" know me.

674
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:36,115
You know, and no one says
that you have to trust me.

675
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,034
It would mak e things a lot easier
for both of us if you could.

676
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,194
Because I don't really
want to hurt anybody.

677
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,074
And I don't wanna be hurt either.

678
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,391
I'm gonna be a mother now.

679
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,071
I'm gonna be a mom.

680
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,639
And that affects...

681
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,599
...both of us. This child...

682
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:02,036
This child, it was conceived in love.

683
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:07,109
Now, you may not have
any love for it, but I do.

684
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:11,872
But that doesn't mean
that you get to walk away.

685
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:16,198
You have as much responsibility
in this as I do.

686
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,676
You really can make things
a lot easier for all of us.

687
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,759
Senator, gentlemen,
I apologize for being late.

688
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,150
Not a problem. Have a seat.

689
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,672
Constance.

690
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:36,196
I think it's time we were women
about this.

691
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,838
Baby, what are you doing?

692
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,797
Figure it out.

693
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,750
Connie, why are you packing?

694
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,389
I'm not going to ask what I did,
because this is so not about me.

695
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:34,235
This is about you and your
"God amongst mortals" mentality.

696
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,750
Thinking you can do whatever you want
and get away with it.

697
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,592
Well, you can't, Emery.

698
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,833
Okay, whoa, whoa. Slow down
for a minute.

699
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,592
Talk to me. What happened?

700
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,070
Why don't you ask your
little girlfriend? We really bonded.

701
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,748
Right after she lured me
to Piedmont Park.

702
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,229
To share your good news.

703
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:58,229
It's rather apropos that a bastard
should father one.

704
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,551
No, I don't wanna hear shit.

705
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,549
It wasn't enough for you to bang
some little gold-digging 'hood rat.

706
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,030
Do you know that she asked me
for money? And I gave it to her.

707
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,395
I gave her a check for 100 grand.

708
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,437
Do you want to know why I paid her?

709
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,353
Because she must have something
that I don't have...

710
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,875
...for you to get her pregnant.

711
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,997
The one thing that you never agreed
to do with me.

712
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,959
- Shit!
- Okay, all right. Let me help you.

713
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,076
No, don't!

714
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,597
- Baby, just listen to me.
- Why? So you can deny it?

715
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,399
Come on, Emery. Deny it.

716
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:38,709
Do some damage control.
Put a good spin on it.

717
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,033
She's not pregnant, Connie.

718
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,350
Fuck you.

719
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:03,073
- Where the fuck you going, huh?
- Derrick, stop it!

720
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,517
- I want my cut!
- Get away from me.

721
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,955
I don't give a shit! Now, where is it?

722
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,918
- I told you, I need more time.
- Well, you out of time.

723
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,117
- Get your ass in here.
- You're hurting me. Stop it.

724
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,117
I'm not playing. I want my money!

725
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,316
- What? What?
- Okay, stop it.

726
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,758
Okay?

727
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,198
Yeah, see, that pretty boy
don't know how you like it.

728
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:26,839
- But I do, right?
- Right.

729
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,275
- That's right.
- You're so good.

730
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,670
- Hell, yeah.
- I see this.

731
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:35,310
- That's the Allannah I know. Yeah.
- Remember that?

732
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:39,393
- That's what I'm talking about though.
- This is better than money, right?

733
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,352
- Say it.
- Okay.

734
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,556
It's better than money.

735
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,390
You dirty bitch.

736
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:57,551
You know why
I don't like gangsters?

737
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,596
Why?

738
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:05,908
Because they think they
can bullshit their way out of anything.

739
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,112
- Even murder.
- This ain't on me.

740
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,589
I ain't the dude
you need to be drilling.

741
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,751
What about those?

742
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,390
Get that out of here.
I don't wanna see that.

743
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,478
What's the matter?
You're not proud of your handiwork?

744
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,393
I'm telling you,
she was very much alive when I left.

745
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:28,070
And you certainly knew how alive
she could get, huh, Mr. Simms?

746
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,589
Try to display some tact, detective.

747
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:34,230
This is a homicide investigation,
not a beauty pageant.

748
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,994
Therefore the questions
are a bit more difficult.

749
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,474
Detective, she was alive.

750
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,312
- Before you left.
- When I left.

751
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,790
- What about before you left?
- We was talking.

752
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:47,589
- About what?
- About our relationship.

753
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:51,749
- Trying to patch things up.
- I was trying to break it off with her.

754
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:56,112
- Like her clothing. They were ripped.
- I don't know nothing about that.

755
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,556
- You didn't rip her clothes?
- No, that's not why it was ripped.

756
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,469
- You positive?
- Maybe she did it herself. I don't know.

757
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,073
How?

758
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,470
When I walked in,
they were having sex.

759
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,148
So you got jealous.
You got angry. Shit happens.

760
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:14,518
So what? I got angry. You're right.
But that doesn't mean I killed anybody.

761
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,750
Did you really think you could play me?

762
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,918
The two of you better
get the fuck out right now.

763
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,350
No, baby. It's not what you think.

764
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,956
It's not what I think?
I think he's trying to fuck you.

765
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:29,715
- It is what you think. I am fucking her.
- No, shut up!

766
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:35,993
I don't want any excuses. Give me my
keys, that check, and get the fuck out!

767
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,879
- Check? What check?
- Look here, little man.

768
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,508
You tried me once.
You want it to happen again?

769
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:44,029
- You motherfucker. What check?
- Do something.

770
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:46,350
You know what? Stop it, both of you.

771
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,272
Derrick, why don't we just leave?

772
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:51,637
You might wanna listen
to your girlfriend. But you know what?

773
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,870
You ain't going till
I get my money.

774
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,235
- Hey.
- No, hey, nothing.

775
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,119
That check, motherfucker.
Now say something.

776
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,276
You little backstabbing...

777
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:05,115
Yeah, see, I owed you that.
Now, raise up and get...

778
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,390
- She ran out on me.
- Did you catch her?

779
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,516
No, I didn't. She was long gone.

780
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:19,317
I'm telling you, I went home
and called my accountant...

781
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:22,392
...so I could stop payment
on that check. That is it!

782
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,111
Look, we was chilling, okay?
All right?

783
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,952
Just catching up on some things.

784
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,429
The next thing I know,
dude come rushing in.

785
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,911
- Simms?
- Yeah, Simms.

786
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,998
He gonna ask us to leave his spot.
Okay, I respect that.

787
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:38,038
It's yours. I'll dip out.
But then he gonna punch me?

788
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,479
You little backstabbing little bitch.

789
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,800
Yeah, see I owed you that one. Now...

790
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,474
Fuck you talking about?

791
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:52,074
- What happened to Allannah?
- I don't know.

792
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:54,510
Okay? Last I saw her,
she ran out the condo.

793
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,272
You murdered her in the condo.

794
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:00,194
Last time I saw her, she was alive
when she left the condo.

795
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:03,796
Sit down. Sit the fuck down!

796
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,030
Y'all are gonna swarm on me.

797
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:10,512
All right? Pull my car over and pull me
down here. That's what happened.

798
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:15,434
But you admit that you were trying
to con Simms out of the money.

799
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:19,120
It wasn't even about Simms.

800
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,555
What about the knife?

801
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,477
What about it?

802
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,429
It had your prints on it, Derrick.

803
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:45,475
- What's happening? Why is he leaving?
- We can't hold him, Miss Caplan.

804
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,240
- Why?
- Not enough evidence. Relax.

805
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,992
Yo, Simms!

806
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,720
Think I'm gonna burn for you?
You killed my wife.

807
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:57,112
You're a dead motherfucker, do you
hear me? A rich, dead motherfucker!

808
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,518
Emery, we should leave.

809
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,552
Yeah.

810
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,839
- Brandon.
- Connie.

811
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,356
- Why weren't you there for him?
- What could I have done?

812
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,511
- I'm trying.
- I'm here.

813
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,477
Connie.

814
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,517
You okay?

815
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,996
- Connie, I know a lot has happened.
- Why don't we skip this part?

816
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,431
I'm afraid if we do, you'll get
in the car and leave for good.

817
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:58,349
I haven't taken my bags out of the car,
and we have an event tonight.

818
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,831
An event?

819
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,879
The exhibition at the Youth Centre?

820
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,473
Yeah, I know. You forgot.

821
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:10,996
I'm the director of the centre.
I have to go. I'll get your tux.

822
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,957
Connie, I didn't do it.

823
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,038
I know.

824
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:17,316
I'm no saint, Emery.

825
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,758
It's just not your style to do this.

826
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,709
I just don't care anymore.

827
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,478
You try to be a good person,
a good wife.

828
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:30,916
Support your husband,
make him wanna come home.

829
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,272
Make him proud to have you
on his arm.

830
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,758
But some days it gets hard
to smile through the bullshit.

831
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,951
But you do.

832
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,509
You just do it.

833
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:48,556
For 11 years, you find ways
to make it work.

834
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,075
And then suddenly...

835
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,590
...it's just not enough.

836
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:58,630
And you start to lose control.

837
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:04,070
You start having these sick thoughts.

838
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:07,074
And sooner or later...

839
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,718
...you're the psycho in the scenario.

840
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,278
Emery...

841
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:21,319
...would you bring my bags in? Please?

842
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,070
Emery.

843
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,197
- Yeah. What's up, baby?
- What are you doing?

844
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:21,989
I thought I left one of your bags
in the car, so I went to go check.

845
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,230
You need to hurry.
I don't wanna be late.

846
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,753
Connie...

847
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,673
...why'd you come back so soon?

848
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:35,388
I put a lot of work into this marriage,
and this is my home.

849
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:39,872
I've earned my place. I wasn't gonna let
anyone take that away from me.

850
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:42,629
Look, baby.

851
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:46,998
I don't think I'm gonna go.

852
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:50,232
No one's coming after you.
The police are satisfied.

853
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,879
Why don't we just move on?

854
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:55,199
Baby, I just need you to give me
tonight, all right?

855
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:59,433
Look, I need a second to come down off
of all this, you know what I'm saying?

856
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,995
Fine.

857
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:54,316
What the fuck?

858
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:59,035
Oh, shit.

859
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,715
Fuck!

860
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,230
- What's up, B?
- Yo, yo, what's up?

861
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,670
What's the matter with you, man?

862
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:26,398
- You're gonna think I've lost my mind.
- Well, I thought that years ago.

863
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:32,029
All right, man. Go ahead. Speak on.

864
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:37,679
I think Connie may have
hurt Allannah, man.

865
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,635
- Want a beer?
- Did you hear what I just said?

866
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,877
What makes you think Connie
would be some kind of murderer?

867
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,749
- Don't even say it like that.
- It's a little late to get squeamish.

868
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,520
Listen, it's just the things
she's been saying.

869
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,319
I've never heard that woman
talk like that, ever.

870
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,876
Man, look, that's a heavy accusation
off of some words, man.

871
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,670
What are you thinking about doing?

872
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,798
I don't know. I don't know
what the fuck to do, man.

873
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:09,795
I don't know if she really did it,
but if she did, it would be my fault.

874
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:13,157
I couldn't blame her for it.
But how do I live with a woman...

875
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,073
...who would do
some crazy shit like that?

876
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:22,595
I'll need something heavier to drink
if we're gonna have this conversation.

877
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:25,957
Come on, B, you're my boy,
and I need you. Tell me something.

878
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:30,033
- Tell me I'm overreacting. Something.
- You are so fucking stupid.

879
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:33,240
Just look at you, man.
Everything you've done.

880
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,630
Everything you have,
somebody gave to you.

881
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,308
Your money. Inherited, not earned.
Your business...

882
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,040
...you don't even know
how to run, I do it.

883
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,919
Your wife. The best thing
that ever happened to you.

884
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:47,390
You can't even get that on your own!
You steal her from me.

885
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:52,031
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I'm glad you asked, motherfucker.

886
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,475
I'm about to get her back.

887
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:58,916
Now, you listen to me,
you sorry little motherfucker.

888
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:03,591
Your little plan has got a hole in it,
because Connie, she's my wife!

889
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:07,548
We are still together, and we are
gonna stay together. Believe that!

890
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:11,156
You walk around like you're
so much better than everyone else.

891
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:14,278
You are no saint, Emery.

892
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:18,994
You killed Stroud and you covered it.
And you killed Allannah.

893
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:22,357
Derrick's gonna take the fall for that
because you set it up.

894
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:25,912
If you come near me or my wife,
if I ever see you again...

895
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,230
...I swear before God,
you are a dead man.

896
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,349
Is that right? Why wait that long?

897
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,352
Wait!

898
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:50,910
You want to kill me? How many people
saw you come in here?

899
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:53,640
Two or three maybe?

900
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:58,191
You ever fuck with me again,
I will kill you. Believe that!

901
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:19,712
To our esteemed mayor
and other distinguished guests...

902
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:23,919
...I want to thank you so much
for sharing this extraordinary evening.

903
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:28,796
Ladies and gentlemen,
our next artist, M'Kai Marks.

904
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:39,593
I present you with my manhood
My man's hood

905
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:45,033
My cloak of detachment
That shows my faces I walk on

906
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:48,670
Mistak enly, thinking I could do it alone

907
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,919
It's only now that I see
That without you

908
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:57,278
I'm simply without
So about is the face I turn

909
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:01,076
Away from the madness
That I learned to accept is true

910
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:03,800
Dropping my hood
Revealing the man

911
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,788
Newly subdued
By renewed dev otion to you

912
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,514
Thank you.

913
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:23,830
- Emery's under arrest.
- You got nothing on me.

914
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,231
- Back off.
- I've cleared myself.

915
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:30,597
Wait! Wait! You can't do this to me.
I didn't kill anybody.

916
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:34,673
I cleared myself. Baby, this is a
mistake. I promise you. I promise you.

917
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:37,513
You know you got the wrong man.

918
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,991
Hey, boy, let me get some
of that brown sugar.

919
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,712
Look at this pretty motherfucker.

920
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,830
Baby...

921
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,833
No, baby, what the hell is this?

922
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,710
- You don't want a divorce, do you?
- There are ways to do this without you.

923
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:38,914
Listen to me. I told you, I did not kill
that woman. You have to believe that.

924
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:42,634
I need to move on, Emery.

925
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,519
Connie, no, don't do this to me.
Don't do this to us.

926
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:49,110
Sign the fucking papers, Emery.

927
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,430
Just sign them.

928
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,068
Baby, what are you doing?

929
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:15,192
Woman, you used to believe in me.

930
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:22,469
Belief is intangible. Don't pretend
you know anything about it.

931
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:25,598
I stopped believing
your conspiracy theories...

932
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:28,672
...right after they found the box cutter.

933
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:32,714
- What box cutter?
- Goodbye, Emery.

934
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,348
Connie, I don't know anything...
Pick up the phone.

935
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:39,957
Pick up the phone! Connie.
Connie, don't leave me like this!

936
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,116
Fuck!

937
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,715
Come on, Simms. This way.

938
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,236
Hey.

939
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:05,755
Come on, Simms.

940
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:56,518
Brandon. Brandon, this was you!
You did this to me!

941
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:59,399
You did this to me with the box cutter!
That was you!

942
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:03,075
Baby, it's him! I didn't do this!
I didn't kill nobody!

943
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:06,238
You better break me out of this,
motherfucker! Let me go!

944
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:11,349
Baby! Baby, I didn't kill nobody! Baby!

945
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:43,589
Fuck!

946
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:48,828
Hey, Jared, let me get a beer
and a Long Island Iced Tea.

947
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,790
Wear something tight.

948
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:01,557
- He's good-Iooking.
- Then it should be an easy fuck.

949
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,950
But don't get it twisted.
He's not the mark.

950
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:05,838
Who is?

951
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,472
His wife.

952
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:11,677
That'll never work.

953
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:16,029
You do this right, she'll pay you
just to get rid of you.

954
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,395
It's all his money anyway.

955
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,556
Trust me.

956
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,275
I know these people.

957
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:41,639
So word is your wife
has a new little boyfriend.

958
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:44,475
- Whose word is that?
- Mine.

959
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:47,638
- And who the fuck are you?
- Let's just say...

960
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:51,236
...I'm a little birdie with some names
you may be interested in.

961
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:54,910
All right, little birdie, sing.

962
