00:02:45,221 --> 00:02:46,987
This isn't funny, you guys!

3
00:03:03,906 --> 00:03:04,909
Stop it!

4
00:03:07,076 --> 00:03:08,278
Stop it!

5
00:03:34,237 --> 00:03:35,506
Jesus!

6
00:03:36,874 --> 00:03:37,938
God!

7
00:03:44,114 --> 00:03:45,880
Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!

8
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:47,350
Jesus! Jesus!

9
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:56,626
Guys?

10
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:01,464
Lydia?

11
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:05,769
Lydia!

12
00:05:14,004 --> 00:05:15,737
Trick playing, my friend.

13
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:18,105
Oh, I'm so scared.

14
00:05:18,107 --> 00:05:19,173
I'm so cared.

15
00:05:19,175 --> 00:05:20,240
But, the saddest part

16
00:05:20,242 --> 00:05:21,742
was how sad.

17
00:05:21,744 --> 00:05:24,312
Remember when they
ripped their hands apart?

18
00:05:24,314 --> 00:05:26,014
Did you see how close they were?

19
00:05:26,016 --> 00:05:28,052
I don't know. It's not
like they have the capacity

20
00:05:29,386 --> 00:05:31,789
Their whole world
is crashing around them.

21
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:38,996
Whoo!

22
00:05:40,297 --> 00:05:42,430
Hurry it up, Francis.

23
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:44,434
Come where I can see. Come on.

24
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:47,470
Hoick! Lateral! Lateral!

25
00:05:48,872 --> 00:05:50,038
Get him!

26
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,441
All right, all right, all right.

27
00:05:58,247 --> 00:06:00,615
You know I'm your supreme
confidant in all things?

28
00:06:00,617 --> 00:06:02,486
You know you can
tell me anything, right?

29
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:06,187
I'm so sick of Francis.

30
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:07,422
Is that why you haven't

31
00:06:07,424 --> 00:06:08,826
been talking much about
you guys, lately?

32
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:13,928
There's nothing to talk about.

33
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,598
I mean, we're together
every waking hour.

34
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,365
I just sort of run out of things

35
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,702
for us to talk about us.

36
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,672
That's all.

37
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:27,341
Well, you just really haven't
been saying that much, lately.

38
00:06:27,343 --> 00:06:28,545
You're not like you used.

39
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:31,915
You know you can tell me.

40
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:33,982
Tell you what?

41
00:06:33,984 --> 00:06:34,985
You know.

42
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,584
No.

43
00:06:37,586 --> 00:06:38,922
I mean, I don't know.

44
00:06:40,456 --> 00:06:41,588
What have you been hearing?

45
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,190
Girl, I don't need to hear.

46
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:44,293
I can tell,

47
00:06:44,295 --> 00:06:45,595
just by the way
you're sick of him.

48
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,396
Mo ho.

49
00:06:48,398 --> 00:06:49,600
Hoick.

50
00:06:52,201 --> 00:06:53,203
Get him!

51
00:06:57,706 --> 00:06:58,939
Never mind the false shit,
all right.

52
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:00,811
Game's not over by a long shot.

53
00:07:05,148 --> 00:07:07,184
Just stay positive.
We're gonna win this game.

54
00:07:12,922 --> 00:07:15,689
The whole object
is to get it to us, Jessie.

55
00:07:15,691 --> 00:07:17,994
- God, all right.
- Tony.

56
00:07:21,364 --> 00:07:22,697
Stand still.

57
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:24,165
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi,

58
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:27,435
three Mississippi, four
Mississippi, five Mississippi.

59
00:07:27,437 --> 00:07:28,638
Is that all you've got?

60
00:07:30,273 --> 00:07:31,809
Come on, let it out.

61
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:35,712
Annes?

62
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:37,245
Come on.

63
00:07:40,016 --> 00:07:41,851
You're runnin' on empty!

64
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:48,889
One more time.

65
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:51,028
Two more down till it's over.

66
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:53,063
Jessie!

67
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:18,154
How did you know?

68
00:08:19,122 --> 00:08:20,721
The girl's got her way.

69
00:08:20,723 --> 00:08:22,790
Just make sure
he uses the rubber,

70
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:25,896
no matter how much
piece of shit says not to.

71
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,130
"Wrap up the sausage",
my mama always said.

72
00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:33,100
You wouldn't want
to start aborting at our age.

73
00:08:33,102 --> 00:08:36,102
God, Lydia! Do you really
have to be so blunt?

74
00:08:36,104 --> 00:08:38,173
How else are you gonna
put something like that?

75
00:08:38,175 --> 00:08:41,143
Just remember the protection
and you wouldn't have to worry.

76
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,476
Unless, you're me and...

77
00:08:42,478 --> 00:08:45,081
...you're boyfriend doesn't
believe in pre-marital sex.

78
00:08:46,982 --> 00:08:48,352
He doesn't believe in sex.

79
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:50,688
Oh ho ho!

80
00:08:51,054 --> 00:08:52,052
Oh ho ho!

81
00:08:52,054 --> 00:08:54,589
But, blowjobs
are perfectly fine.

82
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:56,760
Any hour of the day or night.

83
00:08:57,727 --> 00:08:59,661
Thanks for sharing.

84
00:08:59,663 --> 00:09:01,528
Don't tell me you don't go down.

85
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,697
Just whatever.

86
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:04,934
Just promise me
you won't tell my mom.

87
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:06,603
Swear?

88
00:09:08,472 --> 00:09:10,038
Swear.

89
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,009
Cross my heart...

90
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:46,307
Looks like the game
is finally over.

91
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:47,908
And, they are arguing again.

92
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,679
Doesn't look like
Francis' magic works.

93
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:54,916
It's freezing, let's
go out of here.

94
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:55,984
Yeah.

95
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:58,222
Come on guys, let's go.
It's cold, let's go.

96
00:10:03,993 --> 00:10:05,396
Let's go Tony, it's cold.

97
00:10:07,497 --> 00:10:08,629
Relax!

98
00:10:08,631 --> 00:10:10,664
Take your time guys,
take your time.

99
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,067
Tony!

100
00:10:34,824 --> 00:10:36,957
What's that for, Barb?

101
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,793
Are you saying god couldn't
afford the rent,

102
00:10:38,795 --> 00:10:39,860
so they tossed him out?

103
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,000
Welcome to the 21st century.

104
00:10:45,668 --> 00:10:48,269
Guys, I used to go
to this church with my mom.

105
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:50,638
I was in my last year
of Sunday school,

106
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,139
until they closed it down.

107
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:54,207
I remember that. You even learned
all the prayers and stuff.

108
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:56,079
Oh, yeah, I was an angel, right?

109
00:10:57,247 --> 00:10:58,379
Come on, Barb.

110
00:10:58,381 --> 00:10:59,415
We don't need god anymore.

111
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,115
We didn't leave god today.

112
00:11:02,117 --> 00:11:03,886
- That's right.
- Screw ya.

113
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:22,802
Yo!

114
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:26,908
What you guys up to tonight?

115
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,809
Going down that basement?

116
00:11:28,811 --> 00:11:30,544
It's Friday night, man.
That's what we do.

117
00:11:30,546 --> 00:11:32,614
Hey, man, you coming
down, tonight or what?

118
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,015
We'll see, man.

119
00:11:35,017 --> 00:11:36,884
You guys gonna be
down there late?

120
00:11:36,886 --> 00:11:38,820
Be down there all night.

121
00:11:38,822 --> 00:11:40,422
It'll be a wild night.

122
00:11:40,424 --> 00:11:42,057
A wild night?

123
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:43,360
I think I've heard it all.

124
00:11:48,564 --> 00:11:50,364
Whoa!

125
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:52,269
Look at that.

126
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:56,106
Hey, look, you still get us
for better or worse.

127
00:11:57,173 --> 00:11:58,605
Looks like it's gonna rain.

128
00:11:58,607 --> 00:11:59,809
Let's get out of here.

129
00:12:27,035 --> 00:12:28,505
Can't get shit on the radio.

130
00:12:29,738 --> 00:12:30,940
Has to be the weather.

131
00:12:31,907 --> 00:12:33,476
It is, most definitely.

132
00:12:36,445 --> 00:12:37,580
I'm so bored.

133
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:40,818
Where's your mom?

134
00:12:41,918 --> 00:12:43,017
Out with her boyfriend.

135
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:45,852
Look at Tony. I hope he loses.

136
00:12:45,854 --> 00:12:48,255
Actually, no.
Then he'll be miserable.

137
00:12:48,257 --> 00:12:50,593
Francis seems to win
at everything.

138
00:12:52,596 --> 00:12:53,995
Francis sucks, lately, huh.

139
00:12:53,997 --> 00:12:56,629
Yeah, he does. He's, uh...

140
00:12:56,631 --> 00:12:58,666
...he has a really bad attitude.

141
00:12:58,668 --> 00:12:59,870
- Why?
- Every single day.

142
00:13:01,103 --> 00:13:02,671
I don't know.
Whenever I try to talk to him,

143
00:13:02,673 --> 00:13:04,738
he's always grumpy
about something.

144
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,173
He's like a miserable person.

145
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,707
Yeah.

146
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:09,610
And, I should be the grumpy one.

147
00:13:09,612 --> 00:13:10,881
We don't have that problem.

148
00:13:15,517 --> 00:13:16,717
He likes to do other stuff?

149
00:13:17,788 --> 00:13:18,989
Unfortunately.

150
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:23,692
I don't know.
My mum doesn't know

151
00:13:23,694 --> 00:13:25,625
- about any of this stuff. So...
- Yeah.

152
00:13:25,627 --> 00:13:27,727
- Here's your dollar.
- She'd kill you...

153
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:29,165
She'll freak out. Yeah.

154
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,201
Oh, my god.

155
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:35,503
- I'm so bored.
- I'm out.

156
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:36,870
- Got shit, right?
- No.

157
00:13:36,872 --> 00:13:38,107
I get a royal flush.

158
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,575
No shit I got shit.

159
00:13:40,577 --> 00:13:41,809
If I had some...

160
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,915
We should have
just gone home before.

161
00:13:46,482 --> 00:13:48,849
What's the matter
with you guys, tonight?

162
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:51,085
So what if it's raining out there?
It's not raining in here.

163
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:53,421
No, it's raining down here,
all right.

164
00:13:53,423 --> 00:13:54,925
It's raining boring.

165
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,023
Oh, boo-hoo!

166
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:59,226
Honey's already bored.

167
00:13:59,228 --> 00:14:01,428
You can always call cab
if you wanna go home.

168
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,431
You've got a couple of bucks,
right Barb?

169
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:05,833
- Yeah, couple.
- Cab drivers give me the creeps.

170
00:14:05,835 --> 00:14:07,201
They all look like
psychos to me.

171
00:14:07,203 --> 00:14:09,504
I know right. Either
too skinny or too fat

172
00:14:09,506 --> 00:14:12,072
- It's disgusting, right?
- Or the biggest geeks ever.

173
00:14:12,074 --> 00:14:13,477
Not a normal one
in the bunch, you know.

174
00:14:15,045 --> 00:14:17,043
Too bad my mother went out
with her boyfriend tonight.

175
00:14:17,045 --> 00:14:18,448
She wouldn't have mind
picking us up.

176
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:21,215
What's the matter
with you guys, tonight?

177
00:14:21,217 --> 00:14:23,150
Not getting enough attention
from the boys.

178
00:14:23,152 --> 00:14:25,354
It's not even eight and we are
staying late tonight.

179
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,722
I don't get it,
no fucking service down here.

180
00:14:29,724 --> 00:14:31,458
We never get service down here.

181
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,559
Shut up, Lydia.

182
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:35,361
This is boring. Every week
we get the same thing.

183
00:14:35,363 --> 00:14:37,163
This is always what
you guys want to do.

184
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:40,167
You guys don't even consider
what we want to do.

185
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:42,137
Is it time for that
when we're alone?

186
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:43,203
Ugh!

187
00:14:43,205 --> 00:14:46,005
This is not what
I'm talking about, believe me.

188
00:14:46,007 --> 00:14:47,073
I'm outta this one.

189
00:14:47,075 --> 00:14:48,775
You got chit right?

190
00:14:48,777 --> 00:14:51,979
Ladies and gentlemen, let me
introduce Christopher Columbus.

191
00:14:51,981 --> 00:14:54,048
World famous discoverer.

192
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,319
You stupid bastard.

193
00:14:58,688 --> 00:15:00,657
Well, I got three aces.

194
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:06,192
You guys are not even
listening to us.

195
00:15:06,194 --> 00:15:07,528
Jesus! All you ever wanna do

196
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,365
is play poker
or your fucking balls.

197
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,437
Can we do something
we all can enjoy, for once?

198
00:15:14,804 --> 00:15:17,006
I got it!
Let's play strip poker.

199
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:18,206
I'm in.

200
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,407
You guys will be
fucking cheating

201
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:21,775
and me and Barb will be naked
in half hour.

202
00:15:21,777 --> 00:15:22,911
Damn right.

203
00:15:22,913 --> 00:15:24,845
Yeah, baby! Strip poker.

204
00:15:24,847 --> 00:15:26,880
Poker! Poker!

205
00:15:26,882 --> 00:15:30,551
Get it? Hope you're upset
you're gonna play strip poker.

206
00:15:30,553 --> 00:15:31,852
Strip poker, your ass.

207
00:15:31,854 --> 00:15:33,321
Easy killer.

208
00:15:33,323 --> 00:15:35,089
We don't wanna play cards.

209
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:36,756
How about some truth or dare?

210
00:15:36,758 --> 00:15:38,893
That'll be fun guys, right?

211
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:40,697
We can all get into that.
That's fun.

212
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:42,764
That's lame.

213
00:15:42,766 --> 00:15:44,898
How are we gonna know
who's telling the truth?

214
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,167
Francis, the point
of 'truth and dare'

215
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:47,368
is to tell the truth.

216
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,403
To be as honest as possible.

217
00:15:49,405 --> 00:15:51,308
I know that's a bit difficult
for you.

218
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:53,273
How about the dare part?

219
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:55,045
Are you guys gonna do what...

220
00:15:56,245 --> 00:15:57,447
...what you're dared to do?

221
00:15:58,748 --> 00:16:00,715
You guys are such pigs,
I swear.

222
00:16:00,717 --> 00:16:02,482
Gross.

223
00:16:02,484 --> 00:16:05,154
Hey, didn't your parents
ever teach you not to swear?

224
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:06,721
You guys are lame.

225
00:16:06,723 --> 00:16:10,557
I'm with my man, Jessie,
on some strip... poker!

226
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,293
Yeah, baby!

227
00:16:12,295 --> 00:16:16,596
Poker! Poker! Poker!

228
00:16:16,598 --> 00:16:17,697
Sick albino bastard!

229
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:19,703
Put your shirt back on
before you catch something.

230
00:16:26,742 --> 00:16:28,509
Like sheep without a shepherd.

231
00:16:28,511 --> 00:16:29,512
So, whats up then?

232
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:31,846
I got it.

233
00:16:31,848 --> 00:16:33,913
Let me go upstairs
and get the game.

234
00:16:33,915 --> 00:16:35,218
A game?

235
00:16:36,118 --> 00:16:37,319
Not just a game.

236
00:16:37,886 --> 00:16:39,155
It's not.

237
00:16:40,022 --> 00:16:41,087
I'll be back.

238
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:42,458
He's so mysterious.

239
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,027
What the hell's he up to, now?

240
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:47,564
I hope he's getting some weed.

241
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,720
Some party. Better than
what we've got downstairs.

242
00:17:12,722 --> 00:17:14,355
Oh, Francis, come here.

243
00:17:14,357 --> 00:17:16,324
Hey everybody,
this is my son, Francis.

244
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,959
I want to introduce him to you.

245
00:17:17,961 --> 00:17:19,493
This kid over the summer,
shot up.

246
00:17:19,495 --> 00:17:21,528
Look at him.
Ten pounds a muscle

247
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,596
for each inch
shot in this kid.

248
00:17:23,598 --> 00:17:24,699
Come on, Francis.

249
00:17:24,701 --> 00:17:25,965
One time for everybody here,

250
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:28,169
- Make a muscle for everybody.
- Dad, please. Please, dad.

251
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:29,403
Come on, don't be embarrassed.

252
00:17:29,405 --> 00:17:30,773
Your father's proud of you.

253
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:35,377
Honey, that boy has nothing
to be embarrassed about.

254
00:17:35,877 --> 00:17:37,345
My god!

255
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,316
So freaking handsome.

256
00:17:40,282 --> 00:17:43,419
Yes, yes, my goodness.

257
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,219
Oh, he has grown

258
00:17:45,221 --> 00:17:46,787
since the last time
I saw him.

259
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:48,191
I have grown much bigger.

260
00:17:48,657 --> 00:17:50,159
Naughty boy.

261
00:17:51,694 --> 00:17:54,127
That kid's gonna
be all-pro some day.

262
00:17:54,129 --> 00:17:56,332
All-pro.
Ain't that right, son?

263
00:17:56,933 --> 00:17:58,199
You bet, dad.

264
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:00,437
Chip off the
old block, I tell you.

265
00:18:01,337 --> 00:18:03,503
Hey, you never made all-pro.

266
00:18:03,505 --> 00:18:05,574
I guess, it all depends
on who you ask.

267
00:18:18,087 --> 00:18:19,723
You're baby-sitter again, huh?

268
00:18:20,656 --> 00:18:22,692
That's right

269
00:18:24,827 --> 00:18:27,027
You're in the best place
in the whole world.

270
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:28,498
You just don't realize it, yet.

271
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,509
You don't belong upstairs.

272
00:18:40,242 --> 00:18:42,442
Your son is a grown up man.

273
00:18:42,444 --> 00:18:44,246
Join the party, Zora.

274
00:18:50,886 --> 00:18:52,355
Lighten up.

275
00:18:52,722 --> 00:18:53,757
Bitch!

276
00:18:56,024 --> 00:18:57,324
This one's a little...

277
00:18:57,326 --> 00:18:58,862
...young for you,
isn't he?

278
00:19:00,128 --> 00:19:01,996
If you're judging
by my late husband,

279
00:19:01,998 --> 00:19:03,767
even you would
be considered young.

280
00:19:07,636 --> 00:19:08,672
Interesting.

281
00:19:09,105 --> 00:19:10,307
Cheers.

282
00:19:20,282 --> 00:19:21,914
Hey, I'm watching that.

283
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:22,918
No, you're not.

284
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:25,720
I'm not?

285
00:19:25,722 --> 00:19:26,723
No.

286
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,625
It's watching you.

287
00:19:32,794 --> 00:19:34,194
Know what this is?

288
00:19:34,196 --> 00:19:36,029
Duh! Books.

289
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:37,365
Wise ass.

290
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:39,767
These books have
all the answers

291
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:42,271
that you're ever gonna
need to know your entire life.

292
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,171
How old are you?

293
00:19:44,173 --> 00:19:46,138
Nine. My birthday is next week.

294
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,476
So, you can read them, right?

295
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:50,810
Uh, yeah. For a long time.

296
00:19:50,812 --> 00:19:51,814
Good.

297
00:19:57,485 --> 00:19:59,289
This is a good place
for you to start then.

298
00:20:01,758 --> 00:20:03,289
The Holy Bible?

299
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,560
What kinda book is this?

300
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:06,794
The oldest one.

301
00:20:06,796 --> 00:20:08,665
It's about the beginning
of mankind.

302
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:11,132
Is this about sex?

303
00:20:11,134 --> 00:20:12,633
'Cause I know about sex.

304
00:20:12,635 --> 00:20:14,433
I know I became
in my mum's belly

305
00:20:14,435 --> 00:20:15,903
and came out of mum's cookie.

306
00:20:15,905 --> 00:20:17,273
I saw the video.

307
00:20:18,073 --> 00:20:19,306
This is about what you are

308
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:20,508
and what you can be.

309
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,643
It's also a great place
to start

310
00:20:22,645 --> 00:20:24,948
if you wanna know
everything there is to know.

311
00:20:35,057 --> 00:20:36,656
So, you read all these books?

312
00:20:36,658 --> 00:20:38,895
And, now you know everything?

313
00:20:40,296 --> 00:20:41,931
Yeah, I suppose I do.

314
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:47,503
Don't put that TV back on.

315
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:06,623
A VG board! That's wicked cool.

316
00:21:07,523 --> 00:21:08,588
Ouija?

317
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,190
That's the fucking game you got?

318
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:12,326
Yeah, Ouija. Never heard of it?

319
00:21:12,328 --> 00:21:14,897
This is cool but isn't this
a two player game?

320
00:21:16,132 --> 00:21:17,334
This is old.

321
00:21:18,134 --> 00:21:19,266
What's this do?

322
00:21:19,268 --> 00:21:21,567
It points out the answers
on the board.

323
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:22,869
Spells out the letters.

324
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:23,906
Whatever you ask.

325
00:21:24,874 --> 00:21:26,240
I got this from...

326
00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:27,874
...from the real deal.

327
00:21:27,876 --> 00:21:28,976
Your ass you did.

328
00:21:28,978 --> 00:21:31,345
Fuck you! Got this from a gypsy.

329
00:21:31,347 --> 00:21:32,412
That if she wasn't a witch,

330
00:21:32,414 --> 00:21:33,683
she had witches in her family.

331
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:35,249
Right.

332
00:21:35,251 --> 00:21:36,485
How much did it cost?

333
00:21:37,219 --> 00:21:38,852
Twenty five bucks.

334
00:21:38,854 --> 00:21:39,989
Twenty five bucks?

335
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,221
For a piece of wood?

336
00:21:42,223 --> 00:21:43,490
I think you got a deal.

337
00:21:43,492 --> 00:21:44,624
If it works I mean.

338
00:21:44,626 --> 00:21:46,626
That's a real spare board.

339
00:21:46,628 --> 00:21:47,930
She also said it's very active.

340
00:21:49,665 --> 00:21:52,801
She also said... it's a secret.

341
00:21:53,202 --> 00:21:54,404
Really?

342
00:21:55,672 --> 00:21:57,270
You said it yourself.
Think about it.

343
00:21:57,272 --> 00:21:58,574
"It's a two player game?"

344
00:21:59,008 --> 00:22:00,009
I said that.

345
00:22:00,742 --> 00:22:02,442
The more the better up to six.

346
00:22:02,444 --> 00:22:03,544
With more than six,

347
00:22:03,546 --> 00:22:06,480
things can get kinda messy,
you know.

348
00:22:06,482 --> 00:22:08,182
Think about it. With two,

349
00:22:08,184 --> 00:22:10,653
we could fiddle with the
spirit plane of existence.

350
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,719
But with six,

351
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:14,587
we could penetrate that realm

352
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:16,324
and bend it to our will.

353
00:22:16,326 --> 00:22:17,723
He said "penetrate"!

354
00:22:17,725 --> 00:22:20,095
Yes, my friend,
penetrate and control it.

355
00:22:21,597 --> 00:22:23,196
Ok

356
00:22:23,198 --> 00:22:24,932
We could do more than that.

357
00:22:24,934 --> 00:22:26,901
Anything we imagine.

358
00:22:26,903 --> 00:22:28,868
- Even more.
- You know why they sell this game to kids

359
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,604
and it passes
as a harmless game?

360
00:22:30,606 --> 00:22:32,573
'Cause for two kids
it is a harmless game.

361
00:22:32,575 --> 00:22:35,174
Not for six, it's not harmless.
It's far from it.

362
00:22:35,176 --> 00:22:36,544
You're fucking kidding, right?

363
00:22:36,546 --> 00:22:37,747
Play without me.

364
00:22:40,683 --> 00:22:42,717
Put the number up the beast.

365
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:46,319
We need six to match the
power of the beast!

366
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:47,756
Fuck you, Francis.

367
00:22:49,524 --> 00:22:50,590
Come on, Tony.

368
00:22:50,592 --> 00:22:51,825
Don't be such a party-pooper.

369
00:22:51,827 --> 00:22:53,760
It's a harmless game.
It'll be fun.

370
00:22:53,762 --> 00:22:54,827
Harmless?

371
00:22:54,829 --> 00:22:55,796
Push me?

372
00:22:55,798 --> 00:22:57,865
For two. If all sit
at it the same time,

373
00:22:57,867 --> 00:22:59,465
it becomes more than
just a game.

374
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:00,669
Way more.

375
00:23:02,204 --> 00:23:03,303
Count me out.

376
00:23:03,305 --> 00:23:04,571
You should know this, Francis.

377
00:23:04,573 --> 00:23:07,106
Don't be a wuss, man.
Everyone's into this.

378
00:23:07,108 --> 00:23:08,675
Why against me all the time?

379
00:23:08,677 --> 00:23:10,611
'Cause you fucking don't listen.

380
00:23:10,613 --> 00:23:13,313
All right? Fuck you
and your peer pressure.

381
00:23:13,315 --> 00:23:14,884
What's the big deal, Tony.

382
00:23:16,385 --> 00:23:17,784
Come on, man.

383
00:23:17,786 --> 00:23:19,752
We need six,
everyone's into this.

384
00:23:19,754 --> 00:23:20,956
Don't wuss out on us.

385
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,126
Man!

386
00:23:27,996 --> 00:23:29,429
Six is the magic number.

387
00:23:29,431 --> 00:23:31,597
With six we could tap into it,

388
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:34,201
the creative all-knowing force
of the universe

389
00:23:34,203 --> 00:23:35,637
and bend it to our wills.

390
00:23:36,271 --> 00:23:37,605
Ask and you will receive,

391
00:23:37,607 --> 00:23:40,007
knock and the door
will be opened.

392
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:42,245
We could even raise the dead
if we wanted to.

393
00:23:43,078 --> 00:23:44,481
You got no respect!

394
00:23:46,848 --> 00:23:49,650
You think you can do whatever
you want without consequences?

395
00:23:49,652 --> 00:23:51,488
You've no idea
what you're playing with.

396
00:23:52,387 --> 00:23:54,587
Jesus, Tony, it's just a game.

397
00:23:54,589 --> 00:23:57,357
Will you just play it
for crying out loud?

398
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:58,727
Not playing
with this devil shit.

399
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,202
Go ahead. Play.

400
00:24:07,403 --> 00:24:10,103
Fine. It's a five verse then.

401
00:24:10,105 --> 00:24:12,809
- Not what I had planned but...
- Less power then.

402
00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:17,444
Does one have power
to raise the dead?

403
00:24:17,446 --> 00:24:18,947
I guess there is only way
to find out.

404
00:24:20,415 --> 00:24:22,450
Let's raise a whole army
of the dead!

405
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,622
An ambitious apprentice.
I like that.

406
00:24:26,321 --> 00:24:27,688
Let's start small.

407
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,990
May be, just may be,

408
00:24:29,992 --> 00:24:32,194
we can raise one dead man
from his grave.

409
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,865
It's all fun and games
till someone gets hurt.

410
00:24:38,867 --> 00:24:41,233
You guys should learn some
respect for the old ways.

411
00:24:41,235 --> 00:24:42,502
Okay, okay, already.

412
00:24:42,504 --> 00:24:46,272
We heard the 'Sermon of the
Old Ways' yadi-yadi-yada.

413
00:24:46,274 --> 00:24:49,375
This is the 21st century,
brother.

414
00:24:49,377 --> 00:24:50,810
You better get used to it.

415
00:24:50,812 --> 00:24:53,512
Jeez already, let's just play
an ask us some questions.

416
00:24:53,514 --> 00:24:55,215
I'm dying to see
if this thing really works.

417
00:24:55,217 --> 00:24:56,717
I wanna play.

418
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:58,818
I have questions
and I need answers.

419
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,287
Come on guys, let's play.

420
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:02,890
So gay, he wants to play.

421
00:25:02,892 --> 00:25:04,124
All right, guys,
let's settle down.

422
00:25:04,126 --> 00:25:06,229
If we're gonna do this,
let's do it right.

423
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,098
Everyone's a little familiar?

424
00:25:14,103 --> 00:25:15,602
That's it.

425
00:25:15,604 --> 00:25:17,607
Lightly. Only just touch it.

426
00:25:18,072 --> 00:25:19,606
Good.

427
00:25:19,608 --> 00:25:21,109
Now, press your feet
against each other's.

428
00:25:22,511 --> 00:25:24,344
Form and feel connected.

429
00:25:24,346 --> 00:25:25,746
Let the aura float around you

430
00:25:25,748 --> 00:25:27,515
as I begin the prayer

431
00:25:27,517 --> 00:25:29,184
of protection
from malicious spirits.

432
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:32,618
Protect us, guide us

433
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,887
and fulfill our desire

434
00:25:33,889 --> 00:25:36,624
to know that which is
hidden in plain sight.

435
00:25:36,626 --> 00:25:38,692
Protect these for whom
you've given me to lead.

436
00:25:38,694 --> 00:25:40,693
You're gonna lead them,
all right.

437
00:25:40,695 --> 00:25:42,328
And, even Tony
though he don't believe.

438
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,430
Fuck you, Francis!

439
00:25:43,432 --> 00:25:44,565
Don't even mention my name.

440
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:45,664
That's it. It's done.

441
00:25:45,666 --> 00:25:46,900
We're all protected
and connected,

442
00:25:46,902 --> 00:25:50,136
like, a conductor plugged
into the main frame.

443
00:25:50,138 --> 00:25:51,907
We start by seeing
if anyone's here.

444
00:25:53,908 --> 00:25:55,777
Go ahead, Barbara. Ask.

445
00:25:57,113 --> 00:25:59,749
Is... is anyone there?

446
00:26:00,581 --> 00:26:01,883
Like that?

447
00:26:02,851 --> 00:26:04,585
It's moving.

448
00:26:04,587 --> 00:26:05,919
Someone's moving it.

449
00:26:05,921 --> 00:26:07,790
Nobody's moving it.
It has to, it has to.

450
00:26:08,491 --> 00:26:10,093
Me. Okay.

451
00:26:10,892 --> 00:26:12,726
I need to know about the girl

452
00:26:12,728 --> 00:26:14,428
with a bun in her hair.

453
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,965
The one in my English class.

454
00:26:19,768 --> 00:26:21,233
Does she have the hots for me?

455
00:26:23,705 --> 00:26:25,638
Ooo...

456
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,540
Looks like you're never
getting laid, man.

457
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:30,876
She wants me. You guys moved it.

458
00:26:30,878 --> 00:26:32,346
I know she wants some of this.

459
00:26:32,348 --> 00:26:33,513
Nobody moved it.

460
00:26:33,515 --> 00:26:35,615
Maybe, some day,
when you grow up

461
00:26:35,617 --> 00:26:36,817
if you keep dreaming,

462
00:26:36,819 --> 00:26:38,519
she'll let you get it in.

463
00:26:38,521 --> 00:26:41,321
Your wet dreams piss pop!

464
00:26:41,323 --> 00:26:42,690
You know what jerk,

465
00:26:42,692 --> 00:26:44,557
what if she did like Jessie?

466
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,159
She ain't no better than him.

467
00:26:46,161 --> 00:26:48,496
I've seen her date
worse looking guys.

468
00:26:48,498 --> 00:26:49,932
Ouch!

469
00:26:50,765 --> 00:26:52,668
That's a low blow, Barb.

470
00:26:53,301 --> 00:26:54,902
Jessie ain't that ugly.

471
00:26:57,572 --> 00:26:59,405
You suck, Barbara.

472
00:26:59,407 --> 00:27:01,608
Jessie, I didn't mean to say
you're an ugly guy.

473
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,143
It's not what I meant.

474
00:27:03,145 --> 00:27:06,014
What I meant was that she doesn't
date any better than you.

475
00:27:07,282 --> 00:27:08,981
I mean...

476
00:27:08,983 --> 00:27:10,886
You know what I'm
trying to tell you, right?

477
00:27:11,252 --> 00:27:12,553
Yeah.

478
00:27:12,555 --> 00:27:13,756
Know what you mean.

479
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,588
I don't have the slightest.

480
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,558
Could you clarify that, Barb?

481
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,359
You're such a dick.

482
00:27:20,361 --> 00:27:21,662
I'm your dick.

483
00:27:21,664 --> 00:27:22,962
What I meant to say Francis

484
00:27:22,964 --> 00:27:24,832
is that you're
a big fucking ass hole.

485
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:26,700
You're killing me, baby.

486
00:27:26,702 --> 00:27:28,136
My turn to ask the question.

487
00:27:29,405 --> 00:27:30,405
Roll.

488
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:33,710
Promise not to laugh.

489
00:27:40,715 --> 00:27:41,780
Ouija,

490
00:27:41,782 --> 00:27:43,185
can you tell me about my dog?

491
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:45,685
Boo Boo, my dog?

492
00:27:45,687 --> 00:27:47,122
I lost him when I was five.

493
00:27:47,956 --> 00:27:49,623
I never got over it.

494
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:50,824
What I'd like to know

495
00:27:50,826 --> 00:27:53,096
is if he's in a dog heaven,
somewhere.

496
00:27:54,529 --> 00:27:55,694
Is there a doggy-heaven?

497
00:27:57,866 --> 00:27:59,732
What a stupid question!

498
00:27:59,734 --> 00:28:02,135
You guys promised
you wouldn't laugh.

499
00:28:02,137 --> 00:28:04,005
Seriously, you're just
a bunch of jerks.

500
00:28:06,107 --> 00:28:09,276
Actually, I read somewhere
in an old spiritual book

501
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:10,576
that the souls of animals

502
00:28:10,578 --> 00:28:12,078
reincarnate back
as the same animal.

503
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,647
And, eventually do pass
from this existence into next.

504
00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:15,749
Really?

505
00:28:15,751 --> 00:28:17,518
So, you mean, I could go out

506
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,618
and get another dog

507
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,786
and it could be Boo Boo, again?

508
00:28:19,788 --> 00:28:21,520
What a crock!
Where did you get that from?

509
00:28:21,522 --> 00:28:23,288
From the Hindu belief system.

510
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,891
The atman

511
00:28:24,893 --> 00:28:26,727
or soul if you wanna call it

512
00:28:26,729 --> 00:28:28,394
travels from death to rebirth,

513
00:28:28,396 --> 00:28:29,729
until it reaches nirvana.

514
00:28:29,731 --> 00:28:30,896
Nirvana?

515
00:28:30,898 --> 00:28:32,932
That's the Buddhist doctrine,
not Hindu.

516
00:28:32,934 --> 00:28:35,903
As for souls or atman,
whatever, if you knew anything

517
00:28:35,905 --> 00:28:38,704
you would know that
even amoeba has a life force.

518
00:28:38,706 --> 00:28:41,208
May be, you can come back
as one of them.

519
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,309
All I'm saying is that
I read it from somewhere.

520
00:28:43,311 --> 00:28:45,545
You're not the only person
that reads, Francis.

521
00:28:45,547 --> 00:28:48,284
This is really interesting.
Come on, Tony, play with us.

522
00:28:49,017 --> 00:28:50,916
I already told you 'no'.

523
00:28:50,918 --> 00:28:52,818
What scares you so much?

524
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,621
You're really that scared

525
00:28:54,623 --> 00:28:55,990
of the unknown?

526
00:28:55,992 --> 00:28:58,325
Don't mistake respect
for the unknown as fear of it.

527
00:28:58,327 --> 00:28:59,559
You know about karma.

528
00:28:59,561 --> 00:29:01,761
The idea that
things come full circle,

529
00:29:01,763 --> 00:29:03,195
you especially should
know about karma.

530
00:29:03,197 --> 00:29:04,730
Karma?

531
00:29:04,732 --> 00:29:06,400
You know what I'm talking about.

532
00:29:06,402 --> 00:29:10,304
All right, you guys are reading
way too many books.

533
00:29:10,306 --> 00:29:12,373
Can we just play or what?

534
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,039
Bravo!

535
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:15,911
You have all the answers,
Francis.

536
00:29:16,878 --> 00:29:18,079
Never mind me.

537
00:29:18,946 --> 00:29:20,446
You need to get with it.

538
00:29:20,448 --> 00:29:21,515
This is a new century.

539
00:29:21,517 --> 00:29:23,115
Do as you will
is the new law.

540
00:29:23,117 --> 00:29:24,917
Man, Francis,
you're so full of shit.

541
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:26,653
Enough baloney,
let's get serious.

542
00:29:26,655 --> 00:29:27,857
Hands.

543
00:29:28,322 --> 00:29:30,258
Feet together.

544
00:29:33,395 --> 00:29:34,396
Good.

545
00:29:35,163 --> 00:29:36,462
You're moving it.

546
00:29:36,464 --> 00:29:37,565
Not moving it.

547
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,568
Yes, you are.

548
00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:49,045
It's got all the same letters.

549
00:29:50,811 --> 00:29:51,912
Is it stuck?

550
00:29:51,914 --> 00:29:53,281
How can it be stuck
if it's moving?

551
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:58,050
Try to figure out the letters.

552
00:29:58,052 --> 00:30:00,188
You figure them out,
you're the expert.

553
00:30:14,202 --> 00:30:15,238
Ok

554
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:17,874
Stay with us spirits.

555
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,873
Do not leave us in ignorance

556
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:21,577
but, help us to know
your hidden meaning.

557
00:30:22,344 --> 00:30:23,346
Amen.

558
00:30:23,945 --> 00:30:25,778
It's moving!

559
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,116
You have to concentrate.

560
00:30:28,082 --> 00:30:29,284
What is your name?

561
00:30:44,232 --> 00:30:46,066
That doesn't spell 'ouija'.

562
00:30:46,068 --> 00:30:47,401
Not even close.

563
00:30:47,403 --> 00:30:49,038
I thought you said
his name was 'Ouija'.

564
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:51,538
I got 'Hunge' or one of that.

565
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,972
That's the only name
I could think of.

566
00:30:52,974 --> 00:30:54,641
You guys were moving it.

567
00:30:54,643 --> 00:30:56,241
Is anybody moving it?

568
00:30:56,243 --> 00:30:57,577
What's the point of moving it?

569
00:30:57,579 --> 00:30:58,979
It wouldn't be any fun at all.

570
00:30:58,981 --> 00:31:01,684
I know a kid in school who
mentioned an uncle named 'Hanjo'.

571
00:31:02,684 --> 00:31:03,985
May be, it's an Indian name.

572
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:06,486
Sounds it.

573
00:31:06,488 --> 00:31:07,721
So 'Hanjo' it is.

574
00:31:07,723 --> 00:31:08,888
It's fucking backwards.

575
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,056
What's with freaking us out?

576
00:31:10,058 --> 00:31:11,392
You didn't know either.

577
00:31:11,394 --> 00:31:12,492
It's so obvious.

578
00:31:12,494 --> 00:31:13,861
Yeah, it really is.

579
00:31:13,863 --> 00:31:15,694
Yeah, now that I told you.

580
00:31:15,696 --> 00:31:17,530
That's what I meant, jerk.

581
00:31:17,532 --> 00:31:18,664
It was Jonah, guys.

582
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:20,133
The last letter was a 'J'.

583
00:31:20,135 --> 00:31:21,703
Sad seems 'Jonah'.

584
00:31:22,404 --> 00:31:23,536
I guess.

585
00:31:23,538 --> 00:31:24,941
Is that your name?

586
00:31:25,607 --> 00:31:27,209
Jonah, that is...

587
00:31:27,742 --> 00:31:29,876
It is!

588
00:31:29,878 --> 00:31:31,446
How long have you
been gone from our planet?

589
00:31:31,746 --> 00:31:32,945
Plane.

590
00:31:32,947 --> 00:31:34,847
We live on a planet,
not a plane.

591
00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:37,084
Forget it.

592
00:31:37,086 --> 00:31:40,056
How old were you in your passing
from this plane to the next?

593
00:31:44,992 --> 00:31:46,625
Sixty nine?

594
00:31:46,627 --> 00:31:47,728
Or is it backwards?

595
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,131
Sixty nine, is that correct?

596
00:31:51,031 --> 00:31:52,932
Yes, it's not backwards.

597
00:31:52,934 --> 00:31:54,567
How can we tell backwards in it?

598
00:31:54,569 --> 00:31:55,736
It's fully awake, now.

599
00:31:55,738 --> 00:31:57,306
Guys, I got the chills man.

600
00:31:58,741 --> 00:32:00,108
How did you die?

601
00:32:12,087 --> 00:32:13,289
'Poisnon'?

602
00:32:14,888 --> 00:32:16,288
Poisoned?

603
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:17,693
That's it, you were poisoned.

604
00:32:19,927 --> 00:32:21,129
He was murdered?

605
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,896
Murdered by who?

606
00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:25,031
Who murdered you, Jonah?

607
00:32:25,033 --> 00:32:26,532
Tell us who did it.

608
00:32:26,534 --> 00:32:28,703
I guarantee you'll
feel a lot better if you do.

609
00:32:37,044 --> 00:32:39,014
'Wif poson'?

610
00:32:39,982 --> 00:32:41,615
Wife.

611
00:32:41,617 --> 00:32:43,152
I bet it means his wife.

612
00:32:47,121 --> 00:32:48,556
I feel so bad for him.

613
00:32:49,524 --> 00:32:50,525
Sorry, Jonah.

614
00:32:53,194 --> 00:32:54,730
Why? Why did she do it?

615
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,701
M...

616
00:33:00,469 --> 00:33:01,470
O...

617
00:33:02,972 --> 00:33:04,037
Y...

618
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:05,104
Freaking money.

619
00:33:05,106 --> 00:33:06,342
Root of all evil.

620
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:08,275
My god, you guys,

621
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,777
this thing is telling us
he was murdered by his wife.

622
00:33:10,779 --> 00:33:13,281
And, she did it by
poisoning him for money.

623
00:33:13,915 --> 00:33:15,149
Wow, this is crazy.

624
00:33:15,151 --> 00:33:16,519
Is your wife dead with you?

625
00:33:20,088 --> 00:33:21,357
She's alive.

626
00:33:25,126 --> 00:33:26,828
Ahh!

627
00:33:28,262 --> 00:33:30,098
Lydia, are you okay?

628
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,235
That was freaking freaky.

629
00:33:34,836 --> 00:33:36,271
How did you do that?

630
00:33:38,072 --> 00:33:39,404
He spoke through me.

631
00:33:39,406 --> 00:33:40,807
Is this what
you were talking about

632
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:43,511
when you said you wanted to
do something you could get into?

633
00:33:45,113 --> 00:33:46,315
Wicked.

634
00:33:50,985 --> 00:33:52,554
Call him to join us, Lydia.

635
00:33:58,225 --> 00:33:59,427
Come to us, Jonah.

636
00:34:00,696 --> 00:34:01,697
Now, you say it.

637
00:34:02,564 --> 00:34:03,566
Come to us, Jonah.

638
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:07,836
Come to us, Jonah.

639
00:34:08,537 --> 00:34:09,638
Come to us, Jonah.

640
00:34:11,173 --> 00:34:12,904
Come to us, Jonah.

641
00:34:12,906 --> 00:34:14,309
Come to us, Jonah.

642
00:34:15,276 --> 00:34:17,810
Tony's waiting for you.

643
00:34:17,812 --> 00:34:19,513
Don't be a fucking jerk, Lydia.

644
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,515
Don't call me 'a fucking jerk',
you're 'fucking jerk'.

645
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:22,616
Don't say that

646
00:34:22,618 --> 00:34:24,216
I didn't call you anything.
I said "don't be",

647
00:34:24,218 --> 00:34:25,317
I didn't say you are.

648
00:34:25,319 --> 00:34:26,586
I know what you said.

649
00:34:26,588 --> 00:34:27,553
I'm not stupid.

650
00:34:27,555 --> 00:34:29,555
All I'm saying is
I'm not playing,

651
00:34:29,557 --> 00:34:31,524
so, leave me out
of this devil-shit.

652
00:34:31,526 --> 00:34:34,160
We must concentrate,
otherwise, this won't work.

653
00:34:34,162 --> 00:34:36,499
You need to believe,
we must believe!

654
00:34:39,568 --> 00:34:40,736
Come to us, Jonah.

655
00:34:41,303 --> 00:34:42,738
Come to us, Jonah.

656
00:34:43,338 --> 00:34:45,673
Jonah, come to us.

657
00:34:46,307 --> 00:34:47,807
That's the spirit.

658
00:34:47,809 --> 00:34:49,174
Come to us, Jonah.

659
00:34:49,176 --> 00:34:50,377
Come to us, Jonah.

660
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,412
- Come to us, Jonah.
- Stupid bastards.

661
00:34:52,414 --> 00:34:53,912
Come to us, Jonah.

662
00:34:53,914 --> 00:34:56,182
Jonah, come to us, Jonah.

663
00:34:56,184 --> 00:34:57,553
Come to us, Jonah.

664
00:34:58,185 --> 00:34:59,521
Come to us, Jonah.

665
00:35:00,856 --> 00:35:02,290
Come to us, Jonah.

666
00:35:03,658 --> 00:35:04,792
Come to us, Jonah.

667
00:35:07,062 --> 00:35:08,397
Come to us, Jonah.

668
00:35:09,997 --> 00:35:11,399
Come to us, Jonah.

669
00:35:13,267 --> 00:35:14,470
Come to us, Jonah.

670
00:35:15,903 --> 00:35:17,338
Come to us, Jonah.

671
00:35:18,573 --> 00:35:20,309
Come to us, Jonah.

672
00:35:21,676 --> 00:35:23,178
Come to us, Jonah.

673
00:35:24,845 --> 00:35:26,214
Come to us, Jonah.

674
00:35:27,716 --> 00:35:28,918
Come to us, Jonah.

675
00:35:30,185 --> 00:35:31,921
Come to us, Jonah.

676
00:35:33,155 --> 00:35:34,656
Come to us, Jonah.

677
00:35:36,725 --> 00:35:37,826
Come to us, Jonah.

678
00:35:39,861 --> 00:35:41,230
Come to us, Jonah.

679
00:35:42,296 --> 00:35:43,796
Come to us, Jonah.

680
00:35:43,798 --> 00:35:44,934
Come to us, Jonah!

681
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,834
Come to us, Jonah.

682
00:35:48,669 --> 00:35:50,102
Come to us, Jonah.

683
00:35:50,104 --> 00:35:51,404
Come to us, Jonah.

684
00:35:51,406 --> 00:35:53,073
Come to us, Jonah.

685
00:35:53,075 --> 00:35:54,643
Come to us, Jonah.

686
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,213
Come to us, Jonah.

687
00:35:58,647 --> 00:36:00,345
Come to us, Jonah.

688
00:36:00,347 --> 00:36:02,115
Come to us, Jonah.

689
00:36:02,117 --> 00:36:03,385
Come to us, Jonah.

690
00:36:04,118 --> 00:36:05,354
Come to us, Jonah.

691
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,787
Come to us, Jonah.

692
00:36:07,789 --> 00:36:09,290
Come to us, Jonah.

693
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,156
Come to us, Jonah.

694
00:36:11,158 --> 00:36:12,691
Come to us, Jonah.

695
00:36:12,693 --> 00:36:14,194
Come to us, Jonah.

696
00:36:14,196 --> 00:36:15,861
Come to us, Jonah.

697
00:36:15,863 --> 00:36:17,363
Come to us, Jonah.

698
00:36:17,365 --> 00:36:18,566
Come to us, Jonah.

699
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:20,734
Come to us, Jonah.

700
00:36:20,736 --> 00:36:22,134
Come to us, Jonah.

701
00:36:22,136 --> 00:36:23,736
Come to us, Jonah.

702
00:36:23,738 --> 00:36:24,970
Come to us, Jonah.

703
00:36:24,972 --> 00:36:26,241
Come to us, Jonah.

704
00:36:26,742 --> 00:36:28,073
Come to us, Jonah.

705
00:36:28,075 --> 00:36:29,676
Come to us, Jonah.

706
00:36:29,678 --> 00:36:30,746
Come to us, Jonah.

707
00:38:57,357 --> 00:38:58,524
I'm telling you, guys.

708
00:38:58,526 --> 00:38:59,792
You guys were possessed.

709
00:38:59,794 --> 00:39:01,497
'Possessed'? Yeah, sure.

710
00:39:01,995 --> 00:39:02,928
Tell us another one.

711
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:05,064
I don't kid, all right.
I'm serious.

712
00:39:05,066 --> 00:39:06,499
You all changed.

713
00:39:06,501 --> 00:39:09,067
- Changed how?
- Double voices came out of you guys.

714
00:39:09,069 --> 00:39:10,738
Can you stop it, please?

715
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,475
I wanna know this.

716
00:39:14,475 --> 00:39:16,375
What a freaking head ache.

717
00:39:16,377 --> 00:39:18,113
Then when I got up
to stop you guys...

718
00:39:19,781 --> 00:39:21,413
your eyes,

719
00:39:21,415 --> 00:39:23,549
big and white like gold balls.

720
00:39:23,551 --> 00:39:25,953
I ripped the right from
your hand and smashed it.

721
00:39:27,189 --> 00:39:29,024
You're telling me there
was something inside me?

722
00:39:30,191 --> 00:39:31,193
What did we do.

723
00:39:32,526 --> 00:39:34,195
We went into a reverie,
that's all.

724
00:39:35,396 --> 00:39:36,529
Reverie?

725
00:39:36,531 --> 00:39:39,564
Meaning, we went
into a trance like state

726
00:39:39,566 --> 00:39:41,433
affording a channel
into the spirit one.

727
00:39:41,435 --> 00:39:43,502
You say that like
it's fucking routine.

728
00:39:43,504 --> 00:39:44,837
Come on guys,

729
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:47,473
lets channel the spirits
of the dead. It'll we fun.

730
00:39:47,475 --> 00:39:49,075
You knew something
like this could happen

731
00:39:49,077 --> 00:39:50,709
and, you still let us play?

732
00:39:50,711 --> 00:39:52,979
Whoa ho, didn't you girls say
you needed stimulating?

733
00:39:52,981 --> 00:39:55,517
Not by letting spirits
inside of us.

734
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,118
Subjecting everyone to demons

735
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,588
is your idea of stimulation?

736
00:40:01,055 --> 00:40:01,921
Demons?

737
00:40:01,923 --> 00:40:03,625
Look, I know what I saw,
all right.

738
00:40:04,825 --> 00:40:06,528
You guys know I don't lie.

739
00:40:07,727 --> 00:40:09,597
I think, I'm gonna be sick.

740
00:40:18,439 --> 00:40:19,641
Seriously.

741
00:40:21,209 --> 00:40:22,441
Can we just forget it?

742
00:40:22,443 --> 00:40:23,911
Look how upset it's making her.

743
00:41:01,316 --> 00:41:02,951
God, deliver us from evil.

744
00:41:23,905 --> 00:41:25,470
Something just
doesn't feel right.

745
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:31,112
Hey, guys.

746
00:41:32,347 --> 00:41:33,845
Thanks for stealing my seat,
Tony.

747
00:41:33,847 --> 00:41:35,513
Just keeping it warm
for you, Barb.

748
00:41:35,515 --> 00:41:36,751
Yeah, yeah.

749
00:41:39,988 --> 00:41:41,187
feeling better?

750
00:41:41,189 --> 00:41:42,522
A bit, surely.

751
00:41:42,524 --> 00:41:44,122
Just thought you were
getting a little horny.

752
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,929
Always a dick.

753
00:41:48,095 --> 00:41:49,164
Anyone hear that?

754
00:41:50,365 --> 00:41:52,497
Ssh, listen.

755
00:41:52,499 --> 00:41:55,169
- Francis, please, I think something's wrong.
- Will you shut up!

756
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:56,968
Listen!

757
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,803
Francis, what are you doing?

758
00:41:58,805 --> 00:42:00,242
Will you shut and listen!

759
00:42:07,048 --> 00:42:08,980
Help! He's looking possessed.

760
00:42:08,982 --> 00:42:10,950
Look out

761
00:42:12,354 --> 00:42:13,886
Tony, do something.
Do something!

762
00:42:13,888 --> 00:42:15,955
This is the type of shit
I'm talking about.

763
00:42:15,957 --> 00:42:18,191
Johnny, help me pull him off.

764
00:42:19,394 --> 00:42:20,596
Help!

765
00:42:24,531 --> 00:42:26,064
Jesus!

766
00:42:26,066 --> 00:42:27,234
Deliver him!

767
00:42:34,008 --> 00:42:36,243
You get off me
before I shoot myself?

768
00:42:37,812 --> 00:42:39,848
Everything's a fucking joke
with you!

769
00:42:42,249 --> 00:42:43,982
Fuck you, Francis.

770
00:42:43,984 --> 00:42:46,651
It's all fun and games
till someone gets hurt.

771
00:42:46,653 --> 00:42:48,254
Somebody could have gotten hurt.

772
00:42:48,256 --> 00:42:50,756
Oh ho, smells like shit!

773
00:42:50,758 --> 00:42:53,125
I can't stand you anymore.

774
00:42:53,127 --> 00:42:55,396
Do you realize what
you're doing to a person?

775
00:42:56,531 --> 00:42:58,832
I got you best of all.
What did you say?

776
00:42:58,834 --> 00:43:00,566
"Deliver him, Jesus!"

777
00:43:00,568 --> 00:43:01,870
"Please Jesus!".

778
00:43:02,669 --> 00:43:04,370
What a fucking riot.

779
00:43:04,372 --> 00:43:05,805
You guys, you're too much.

780
00:43:05,807 --> 00:43:08,875
You guys are looking like
you've seen the devil himself.

781
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,846
Come on, I really didn't
get you with this one?

782
00:43:11,613 --> 00:43:12,946
Got to admit,

783
00:43:12,948 --> 00:43:14,216
it was a rush and a half.

784
00:43:15,517 --> 00:43:17,015
You guys are too much.

785
00:43:17,017 --> 00:43:18,785
I gotta take a piss,
I gotta take piss.

786
00:43:18,787 --> 00:43:20,321
Yes, take a crap too
while you're at it.

787
00:43:21,856 --> 00:43:24,924
Oh, guys, too fucking much.

788
00:43:24,926 --> 00:43:27,095
Lighten up, it's just a joke.

789
00:43:57,024 --> 00:44:00,796
Hello?

790
00:44:17,879 --> 00:44:19,915
So glad, you showed up again.

791
00:44:20,247 --> 00:44:21,113
Come on,

792
00:44:21,115 --> 00:44:24,149
aw, how can I forget you? Ah!

793
00:44:24,151 --> 00:44:25,153
Give me a hug.

794
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,930
I know you guys think
I'm an asshole

795
00:44:35,662 --> 00:44:37,696
and I am.

796
00:44:37,698 --> 00:44:39,334
But, I want you guys
to know, no matter what,

797
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,600
I really do love you.

798
00:44:41,602 --> 00:44:42,803
We love you too, man.

799
00:44:43,504 --> 00:44:44,939
Imagine, if it really happened.

800
00:44:45,705 --> 00:44:46,971
Imagine what?

801
00:44:46,973 --> 00:44:48,176
Raising the dead.

802
00:44:48,508 --> 00:44:49,707
Shit!

803
00:44:49,709 --> 00:44:51,642
I would have shit myself so bad!

804
00:44:51,644 --> 00:44:53,314
I would shit and piss myself.

805
00:44:54,716 --> 00:44:55,814
You're gonna shit, all right.

806
00:44:55,816 --> 00:44:57,218
Every single one of you.

807
00:44:58,952 --> 00:45:00,155
You wouldn't, hero?

808
00:45:15,937 --> 00:45:17,506
Really scary, guys.

809
00:45:18,705 --> 00:45:20,408
Really shaking in my shoes, now.

810
00:45:26,647 --> 00:45:28,048
Who's out there?

811
00:45:31,618 --> 00:45:32,887
Of course.

812
00:45:33,955 --> 00:45:35,190
Who else could it be.

813
00:45:37,158 --> 00:45:38,260
Jonah.

814
00:45:40,127 --> 00:45:41,997
Recently revived from the dead.

815
00:45:43,464 --> 00:45:44,466
After all,

816
00:45:45,566 --> 00:45:46,867
you did invite him.

817
00:45:50,171 --> 00:45:52,537
You go welcome our guests, then.

818
00:45:52,539 --> 00:45:54,375
I bet it's Joe,
messing with our heads.

819
00:45:55,609 --> 00:45:56,812
Bet it is.

820
00:45:57,912 --> 00:45:59,381
What do you think he's up to?

821
00:46:19,033 --> 00:46:20,234
Go get him, killer.

822
00:46:35,316 --> 00:46:36,318
Who is it, Tony?

823
00:46:37,218 --> 00:46:38,220
Can you see?

824
00:46:51,097 --> 00:46:52,399
Real funny, Joe.

825
00:47:13,053 --> 00:47:14,622
Wait for it, Joe.

826
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:30,505
Shit! Holy shit!

827
00:47:31,205 --> 00:47:32,207
No...

828
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,339
What the fuck, Joe!

829
00:47:34,341 --> 00:47:36,544
You fucking kidding me, man!
What the fuck!

830
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:40,712
No, no, no, no, no, Joe! No!

831
00:47:40,714 --> 00:47:42,113
Don't do it, Joe! Why?

832
00:47:42,115 --> 00:47:44,651
Why... don't do it, Joe! Joe!

833
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:45,951
Get away from...

834
00:47:52,892 --> 00:47:54,859
Holy god! Help me!

835
00:47:54,861 --> 00:47:56,662
Holy gosh! No, don't, Joe.

836
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,239
Tony!

837
00:48:13,046 --> 00:48:14,513
Fuck with Joe...

838
00:48:14,515 --> 00:48:16,048
It's not Joe!

839
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:17,986
He's on drugs, that stupid pork.

840
00:48:19,086 --> 00:48:20,486
What you up to now Joe?

841
00:48:20,488 --> 00:48:22,154
It's not Joe!

842
00:48:22,156 --> 00:48:24,159
Give me a chair,
give me a chair.

843
00:48:28,062 --> 00:48:29,794
What happened, Lydia?
What did you see?

844
00:48:29,796 --> 00:48:33,131
Tony's dea... he's dead!

845
00:48:33,133 --> 00:48:34,533
What do you mean he's dead?

846
00:48:34,535 --> 00:48:35,767
He removed his head.

847
00:48:35,769 --> 00:48:37,002
He turned back

848
00:48:37,004 --> 00:48:38,636
and whacked him
right in the head!

849
00:48:38,638 --> 00:48:39,974
Did you see who it was?

850
00:48:40,642 --> 00:48:42,077
He's dead!

851
00:48:49,417 --> 00:48:50,618
Tony!

852
00:48:53,486 --> 00:48:55,189
Tone!

853
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:58,057
He's dead!

854
00:48:58,059 --> 00:48:59,361
Tony's dead!

855
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,328
Is it Joe?

856
00:49:01,861 --> 00:49:03,227
Is it Jonah?

857
00:49:03,229 --> 00:49:05,363
- Did we do it?
- Are you insane?

858
00:49:05,365 --> 00:49:07,265
Joe's been taking
all kinds of drugs.

859
00:49:07,267 --> 00:49:09,567
He probably took some bad shit
and lost his mind.

860
00:49:09,569 --> 00:49:11,205
What if it's Jonah?

861
00:49:18,046 --> 00:49:19,611
What did you see?

862
00:49:19,613 --> 00:49:21,249
Stop it, Johny, stop it.

863
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:24,015
We're gonna get this burnout.

864
00:49:24,017 --> 00:49:25,753
What're you gonna
do against Jonah?

865
00:49:26,486 --> 00:49:28,055
It's Joe!

866
00:49:28,622 --> 00:49:29,656
Fucking druggie!

867
00:49:30,524 --> 00:49:31,526
I told you,

868
00:49:32,026 --> 00:49:33,493
it was Jonah.

869
00:49:33,495 --> 00:49:34,459
He killed him.

870
00:49:34,461 --> 00:49:36,294
All that blood,
Tony's blood, all over,

871
00:49:36,296 --> 00:49:37,629
and Jonah laughing at me.

872
00:49:37,631 --> 00:49:38,665
Wanting me to see it.

873
00:49:43,037 --> 00:49:44,472
What are we gonna
tell Tony's mom?

874
00:49:46,874 --> 00:49:48,406
It's just Joe out there.

875
00:49:48,408 --> 00:49:49,508
Just Joe.

876
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:50,712
No, it's not.

877
00:49:52,013 --> 00:49:53,310
We have to do something.

878
00:49:53,312 --> 00:49:54,779
The three of us will get him,

879
00:49:54,781 --> 00:49:55,783
get upstairs...

880
00:49:59,921 --> 00:50:02,256
Yeah, what if it's Jonah
and we can't get through?

881
00:50:03,423 --> 00:50:06,091
It's three of us against him.

882
00:50:06,093 --> 00:50:08,727
He;'s probably having
some fucking bad trip.

883
00:50:08,729 --> 00:50:10,497
One of us will make it upstairs.

884
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,468
I'm afraid, Francis.

885
00:50:24,044 --> 00:50:26,345
Honey, the first time
I married for love.

886
00:50:26,347 --> 00:50:28,848
Second time,
I married for money.

887
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:30,351
Freaking lots of it!

888
00:50:31,484 --> 00:50:33,586
So, what's it gonna be for,
this time?

889
00:50:33,588 --> 00:50:34,453
This time?

890
00:50:34,455 --> 00:50:37,092
Seriously, why would I
marry again?

891
00:50:39,093 --> 00:50:40,459
What about him?

892
00:50:40,461 --> 00:50:43,395
Him? Ah, he's just
to amuse myself.

893
00:50:43,397 --> 00:50:45,964
A man's only good for thing.

894
00:50:45,966 --> 00:50:47,866
Ha ha, get it? 'Thing'!

895
00:50:47,868 --> 00:50:50,435
Bigger the thing is, the better.

896
00:50:50,437 --> 00:50:53,004
There's only so much man
that you can handle.

897
00:50:53,006 --> 00:50:54,140
Believe me honey,

898
00:50:54,142 --> 00:50:56,310
you don't know
how much I can handle.

899
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:58,209
Neither do I.

900
00:51:07,055 --> 00:51:08,823
Oh, my god, Joe,
what did you do?

901
00:51:10,024 --> 00:51:11,226
Is that blood?

902
00:51:12,959 --> 00:51:14,026
Holy shit!

903
00:51:14,028 --> 00:51:15,493
There's blood everywhere.

904
00:51:15,495 --> 00:51:18,133
Joe, just keep your head cool,
we can get you some help.

905
00:51:22,002 --> 00:51:23,238
Oh, god!

906
00:51:33,946 --> 00:51:35,149
What the hell happened?

907
00:51:52,633 --> 00:51:53,667
Hey, get me out

908
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:58,606
- They're already big enough.
- Give me the ones you got.

909
00:52:00,341 --> 00:52:02,140
- What good are those?
- I got them all.

910
00:52:02,142 --> 00:52:03,207
They're no good!

911
00:52:03,209 --> 00:52:04,810
What the hell
did you do that for?

912
00:52:04,812 --> 00:52:07,182
Those aren't gonna keep
it out if he wants to get in!

913
00:52:20,727 --> 00:52:22,896
It's empty!

914
00:52:23,763 --> 00:52:24,832
Can't breathe.

915
00:52:32,906 --> 00:52:34,105
He's not breathing.

916
00:52:34,107 --> 00:52:35,174
Breathe, dammit!

917
00:52:35,176 --> 00:52:36,707
You don't die like this!
Breathe!

918
00:52:36,709 --> 00:52:37,711
Stop it!

919
00:52:38,379 --> 00:52:39,444
Can't breathe.

920
00:52:39,446 --> 00:52:40,781
He's not breathing.

921
00:52:46,921 --> 00:52:47,955
What to do?

922
00:52:53,993 --> 00:52:54,995
Breathe!

923
00:52:57,330 --> 00:52:59,163
What to do!

924
00:52:59,165 --> 00:53:00,732
You don't die like this!

925
00:53:00,734 --> 00:53:01,736
Breathe.

926
00:53:04,905 --> 00:53:05,906
Breathe.

927
00:53:12,646 --> 00:53:13,714
Please!

928
00:53:14,914 --> 00:53:15,949
Please!

929
00:53:17,584 --> 00:53:19,520
What you doing? Don't stop!

930
00:53:21,321 --> 00:53:22,522
That's it!

931
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:24,892
Stop it, Johnny.

932
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,727
Stop it!
You're breaking his ribs.

933
00:53:28,729 --> 00:53:29,731
Stop!

934
00:53:36,069 --> 00:53:37,805
Jessie was already dead,
Johnny.

935
00:53:38,805 --> 00:53:40,040
We did what we could.

936
00:53:40,774 --> 00:53:42,207
He gave up.

937
00:53:42,209 --> 00:53:43,611
I tried to save him.

938
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,415
What will we tell his mom?

939
00:53:51,452 --> 00:53:52,754
Jonah got you too, Jessie.

940
00:53:54,754 --> 00:53:56,087
Jessie got Jessie.

941
00:53:56,089 --> 00:53:57,522
He didn't fight.

942
00:53:57,524 --> 00:53:59,560
He should've fought,
not given up.

943
00:54:08,234 --> 00:54:09,636
Stop looking at him!

944
00:54:13,673 --> 00:54:15,075
How could this be happening?

945
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:19,078
I can't...

946
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,615
I don't wanna die!

947
00:54:27,354 --> 00:54:28,622
Come on, Barb.

948
00:54:37,832 --> 00:54:38,833
We're only just kids.

949
00:54:41,167 --> 00:54:42,334
God, please,

950
00:54:42,336 --> 00:54:44,772
we didn't mean
any of this to happen!

951
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:49,107
That doesn't matter, anymore.

952
00:54:49,109 --> 00:54:50,274
We're all dead.

953
00:54:50,276 --> 00:54:52,012
Would you just shut up, Lydia!

954
00:54:52,879 --> 00:54:54,078
It's all a joke.

955
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,584
Everything that we thought
mattered, just doesn't.

956
00:54:57,450 --> 00:55:00,051
One big, fat, meaningless joke.

957
00:55:00,053 --> 00:55:01,218
You're on my nerves like...

958
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,757
I can't even just
tell you to shut up!

959
00:55:15,068 --> 00:55:16,370
I propose a toast.

960
00:55:21,542 --> 00:55:23,609
Everyone, everyone,
I propose a toast.

961
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,847
To my dear departed husband.

962
00:55:26,479 --> 00:55:28,682
To my dear JJ Mathais.

963
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:34,852
To my dear JJ Mathais.

964
00:55:34,854 --> 00:55:37,788
Let it be known
in the company of friends

965
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:40,058
that I love you even more now

966
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,326
that you're dead

967
00:55:41,328 --> 00:55:42,794
than when you were alive.

968
00:55:42,796 --> 00:55:44,899
Cheers!

969
00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:10,892
I don't even have
my license yet.

970
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,162
I'm not ready!

971
00:56:15,162 --> 00:56:16,164
All the dreams I have.

972
00:56:57,305 --> 00:56:58,839
<i>It was a joke, Tony.</i>

973
00:56:59,906 --> 00:57:01,372
Ok

974
00:57:01,374 --> 00:57:02,809
I warned you.

975
00:57:04,377 --> 00:57:05,713
Too much to listen.

976
00:57:09,115 --> 00:57:10,884
It's too late for that.

977
00:57:11,986 --> 00:57:13,688
Over, it's gone.

978
00:57:14,988 --> 00:57:16,421
Fool's game.

979
00:57:16,423 --> 00:57:17,522
I didn't know.

980
00:57:17,524 --> 00:57:19,727
I warned you!

981
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:23,865
It's all your fault.

982
00:57:24,631 --> 00:57:27,001
Your fault that we all died.

983
00:57:30,069 --> 00:57:31,506
I'm so sorry.

984
00:57:35,609 --> 00:57:37,545
It's all your fault.

985
00:57:40,113 --> 00:57:41,716
It's all your fault.

986
00:57:44,718 --> 00:57:47,653
Our dreams are shattered,

987
00:57:47,655 --> 00:57:48,856
because of you.

988
00:57:51,325 --> 00:57:53,491
All your fault.

989
00:57:53,493 --> 00:57:55,296
It's all your fault.

990
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:59,599
It's all your fault.

991
00:58:00,434 --> 00:58:03,104
It's all your fault.

992
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:07,040
It's all your fault.

993
00:58:08,675 --> 00:58:11,477
It's all your fault.

994
00:58:11,479 --> 00:58:12,946
It's all my fault.

995
00:58:14,747 --> 00:58:15,814
It's all my fault.

996
00:58:15,816 --> 00:58:18,417
It's all your fault.

997
00:58:18,419 --> 00:58:19,484
It's all my fault.

998
00:58:19,486 --> 00:58:21,185
My, my, my, my...

999
00:58:21,187 --> 00:58:22,622
It's all my fault!

1000
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:27,028
Francis, please stay strong.

1001
00:58:27,693 --> 00:58:29,062
It's all my fault, Barbara.

1002
00:58:30,097 --> 00:58:32,800
No one's putting blame.
No one's blaming you.

1003
00:58:33,232 --> 00:58:34,234
Yes, they are.

1004
00:58:35,702 --> 00:58:36,904
They want me to do something.

1005
00:58:37,838 --> 00:58:39,874
Francis, no one's blaming you.

1006
00:58:40,341 --> 00:58:42,941
Yes, they are.

1007
00:58:42,943 --> 00:58:45,410
No, no one is.

1008
00:58:45,412 --> 00:58:47,615
Tony and Jessie want me to.

1009
00:58:57,289 --> 00:58:58,291
I know what I have to do.

1010
00:58:59,959 --> 00:59:02,228
No, you're insane.
We need you.

1011
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:12,272
Our baby needs you.

1012
00:59:19,213 --> 00:59:20,214
Are you really pregnant?

1013
00:59:31,425 --> 00:59:32,660
I gotta go help him.

1014
00:59:44,403 --> 00:59:45,872
Look behind you!

1015
00:59:50,077 --> 00:59:51,078
Run dude, run!

1016
01:00:32,486 --> 01:00:34,221
No, no, Francis!

1017
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:03,383
No. No!

1018
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:08,254
Three down,

1019
01:01:09,089 --> 01:01:10,124
three to go.

1020
01:01:11,792 --> 01:01:13,961
My god, what have we done!

1021
01:01:15,794 --> 01:01:17,030
There's no god.

1022
01:01:17,631 --> 01:01:18,866
Only death.

1023
01:01:22,202 --> 01:01:23,100
Stop it, Lydia.

1024
01:01:23,102 --> 01:01:24,437
You don't know
what you're saying.

1025
01:01:25,238 --> 01:01:26,370
It's a joke.

1026
01:01:26,372 --> 01:01:30,308
Life is one big, fat,
meaningless joke.

1027
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:32,609
This is what you want
for your baby?

1028
01:01:32,611 --> 01:01:34,611
Life and everything in it,

1029
01:01:34,613 --> 01:01:35,979
it's all a lie.

1030
01:01:35,981 --> 01:01:37,784
Everything that
we thought was true

1031
01:01:38,551 --> 01:01:39,754
is a such a hoax.

1032
01:01:40,586 --> 01:01:41,789
Don't lose hope.

1033
01:01:42,888 --> 01:01:45,526
Hope is for those
who can't face the truth.

1034
01:01:46,725 --> 01:01:47,928
Face the truth, Barbara.

1035
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:51,832
You just have to pull
yourself together, all right.

1036
01:01:52,932 --> 01:01:54,365
Me and Johnny need you.

1037
01:01:54,367 --> 01:01:56,533
- We need you.
- Accept it!

1038
01:01:56,535 --> 01:01:58,303
Stop lying to yourself.

1039
01:01:58,305 --> 01:02:00,406
It's a dream. You wake up
from it and forget it.

1040
01:02:01,341 --> 01:02:02,843
That's life and death

1041
01:02:03,943 --> 01:02:05,146
and we're already dead.

1042
01:02:07,013 --> 01:02:08,680
No, there has to be
a way outta this.

1043
01:02:08,682 --> 01:02:10,317
There has to be a way
to send it back.

1044
01:02:13,988 --> 01:02:16,087
With this. We got this
thing here, with this

1045
01:02:16,089 --> 01:02:18,092
and we'll send it back with it.

1046
01:02:19,426 --> 01:02:20,991
Lydia, it will work.

1047
01:02:20,993 --> 01:02:23,097
You just have to believe it.
We can do this.

1048
01:02:24,597 --> 01:02:25,800
It's not going to work.

1049
01:02:26,265 --> 01:02:27,665
Will work.

1050
01:02:27,667 --> 01:02:29,433
No, it won't.

1051
01:02:29,435 --> 01:02:32,502
It will, we have to believe
it will and it will work.

1052
01:02:34,475 --> 01:02:36,540
It's not gonna work, Barbara.

1053
01:02:36,542 --> 01:02:37,808
Johnny, it will work.

1054
01:02:37,810 --> 01:02:39,176
We just have to believe.

1055
01:02:39,178 --> 01:02:40,178
Please.

1056
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:42,113
It's not gonna work
no matter how hard we try.

1057
01:02:42,115 --> 01:02:43,381
We should try at least.

1058
01:02:43,383 --> 01:02:45,318
All good things come
to an end, Barbara.

1059
01:02:46,586 --> 01:02:47,588
We're all gonna die.

1060
01:02:48,588 --> 01:02:49,823
Me,

1061
01:02:50,089 --> 01:02:51,091
you,

1062
01:02:51,758 --> 01:02:53,357
Johnny

1063
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:54,461
and your fucking baby!

1064
01:03:00,801 --> 01:03:02,303
Fucking stupid baby.

1065
01:03:10,676 --> 01:03:12,046
You know why it won't work?

1066
01:03:12,278 --> 01:03:13,578
No.

1067
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:15,616
Because Tony broke it, remember?

1068
01:03:16,381 --> 01:03:17,781
Not you.

1069
01:03:17,783 --> 01:03:19,319
Not you, too.

1070
01:03:27,493 --> 01:03:28,993
We're all gonna die.

1071
01:03:28,995 --> 01:03:32,098
And, you just have to accept it.

1072
01:03:35,468 --> 01:03:36,734
It's broken, Barbara.

1073
01:03:36,736 --> 01:03:38,102
There are pieces everywhere.

1074
01:03:38,104 --> 01:03:40,537
Doesn't matter
about the broken pieces.

1075
01:03:40,539 --> 01:03:42,006
Somehow, it still has to work.

1076
01:03:42,008 --> 01:03:45,980
You're
wasting your fucking time!

1077
01:03:47,548 --> 01:03:48,712
Time?

1078
01:03:48,714 --> 01:03:50,147
I'm wasting my time?

1079
01:03:50,149 --> 01:03:51,816
You're wasting your time.

1080
01:03:51,818 --> 01:03:52,917
Even if it doesn't work

1081
01:03:52,919 --> 01:03:54,454
at least I did something
with my time.

1082
01:03:56,522 --> 01:03:57,955
Lydia, Barbara's right.

1083
01:03:57,957 --> 01:04:00,558
Yeah, I am right.

1084
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:03,530
We didn't follow any rules to get
this thing here. We believed.

1085
01:04:04,796 --> 01:04:06,399
If we believe what we did before

1086
01:04:07,533 --> 01:04:08,535
we can send Jonah back.

1087
01:04:12,839 --> 01:04:14,041
How do we start?

1088
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,243
So you know what to say?

1089
01:04:17,611 --> 01:04:18,612
No.

1090
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,383
We just have to believe that
we can send Jonah back.

1091
01:04:24,484 --> 01:04:26,084
Join hands and feet.

1092
01:04:26,086 --> 01:04:27,321
Like we did before.

1093
01:04:32,959 --> 01:04:34,892
I don't know what to say.

1094
01:04:34,894 --> 01:04:37,995
So, I'm just gonna say
what I'm feeling.

1095
01:04:37,997 --> 01:04:39,599
Can we do this like this?

1096
01:04:45,405 --> 01:04:48,542
Before today, I thought I knew
everything I need to know.

1097
01:04:50,109 --> 01:04:51,511
Now, I realize I know nothing.

1098
01:04:54,881 --> 01:04:56,083
Nothing at all.

1099
01:04:58,685 --> 01:04:59,687
What we did

1100
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:02,156
we did out of ignorance.

1101
01:05:03,522 --> 01:05:05,158
Tony knew somehow.

1102
01:05:05,792 --> 01:05:07,359
He tried.

1103
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:10,397
He warned us because he knew
and respected the power

1104
01:05:11,131 --> 01:05:13,763
and he was afraid.

1105
01:05:13,765 --> 01:05:17,403
He was afraid because he knew
we're ignorant of these things.

1106
01:05:19,171 --> 01:05:22,508
May be, we should try to apologize
for being disrespectful.

1107
01:05:26,178 --> 01:05:27,447
Please forgive us, Jonah.

1108
01:05:29,682 --> 01:05:31,684
We are really, really sorry.

1109
01:05:32,718 --> 01:05:34,185
Please forgive us, Jonah.

1110
01:05:34,187 --> 01:05:38,359
Truly, Tony, Jessie
and Francis are sorry.

1111
01:05:41,127 --> 01:05:44,164
Awe and respect
of the super-natural gained

1112
01:05:46,098 --> 01:05:48,102
at the fearful price
of our friends' lives.

1113
01:05:53,973 --> 01:05:55,038
Forgive us, Jonah.

1114
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,609
Go back and rest in peace.

1115
01:05:57,944 --> 01:05:59,580
Please forgive us, Jonah.

1116
01:06:01,214 --> 01:06:02,649
Go back and rest in peace.

1117
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:05,216
Forgive us, Jonah.

1118
01:06:05,218 --> 01:06:07,087
Go back and rest in peace.

1119
01:06:08,521 --> 01:06:10,020
Forgive us, Jonah.

1120
01:06:10,022 --> 01:06:11,691
Go back and rest in peace.

1121
01:06:12,758 --> 01:06:14,191
Forgive us, Jonah.

1122
01:06:14,193 --> 01:06:15,796
Go back and rest in peace.

1123
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:19,096
Forgive us, Jonah.

1124
01:06:19,098 --> 01:06:20,767
Go back and rest in peace.

1125
01:06:22,135 --> 01:06:23,602
Forgive us, Jonah.

1126
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:25,472
Go back and rest in peace.

1127
01:06:26,606 --> 01:06:28,138
Forgive us Jonah.

1128
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:29,709
Go back and rest in peace.

1129
01:06:31,044 --> 01:06:32,310
Forgive us, Jonah.

1130
01:06:32,312 --> 01:06:34,415
Go back and rest in peace.

1131
01:06:35,848 --> 01:06:37,113
Forgive us, Jonah.

1132
01:06:37,115 --> 01:06:39,118
Go back and rest in peace.

1133
01:06:40,153 --> 01:06:41,653
Forgive us, Jonah.

1134
01:06:41,655 --> 01:06:43,290
Go back and rest in peace.

1135
01:06:44,591 --> 01:06:45,991
Forgive us, Jonah.

1136
01:06:45,993 --> 01:06:47,761
Go back and rest in peace.

1137
01:06:49,062 --> 01:06:50,294
Forgive us, Jonah.

1138
01:06:50,296 --> 01:06:52,499
Go back and rest in peace.

1139
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,098
Forgive us, Jonah.

1140
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:56,569
Go back and rest in peace.

1141
01:06:58,071 --> 01:06:59,303
Forgive us, Jonah.

1142
01:06:59,305 --> 01:07:00,971
Go back and rest in peace.

1143
01:07:00,973 --> 01:07:02,073
Forgive us, Jonah.

1144
01:07:02,075 --> 01:07:04,144
Go back and rest in peace.

1145
01:07:07,814 --> 01:07:09,180
Forgive us, Jonah.

1146
01:07:09,182 --> 01:07:11,118
Go back and rest in peace.

1147
01:07:12,551 --> 01:07:13,951
Forgive us, Jonah.

1148
01:07:13,953 --> 01:07:15,586
Go back and rest in peace.

1149
01:07:15,588 --> 01:07:16,589
Mom.

1150
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:19,193
Mom.

1151
01:07:23,729 --> 01:07:24,764
Mom.

1152
01:07:27,401 --> 01:07:28,402
Mom.

1153
01:07:33,707 --> 01:07:35,240
What is it, hon?

1154
01:07:35,242 --> 01:07:37,176
Can you give me
a glass of water?

1155
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:38,679
Sure.

1156
01:07:47,821 --> 01:07:49,289
Here, drink up.

1157
01:07:57,062 --> 01:07:59,499
Mommy's downstairs, okay.

1158
01:08:11,843 --> 01:08:12,846
Do you think it worked?

1159
01:08:23,088 --> 01:08:24,290
Do you think we sent it back?

1160
01:08:25,158 --> 01:08:26,360
'Him'.

1161
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:27,992
What?

1162
01:08:27,994 --> 01:08:29,059
Jonah was a man.

1163
01:08:29,061 --> 01:08:30,564
'Him'. Not 'it'.

1164
01:08:30,997 --> 01:08:32,162
Him? It?

1165
01:08:32,164 --> 01:08:33,533
I don't give a shit.

1166
01:08:34,767 --> 01:08:36,133
Did we do it?

1167
01:08:36,135 --> 01:08:37,402
Did we send what ever
the hell it is

1168
01:08:37,404 --> 01:08:39,239
back to where ever
the hell it came from?

1169
01:08:39,705 --> 01:08:40,707
Easy, Johnny.

1170
01:08:41,607 --> 01:08:43,174
We sent him back.

1171
01:08:43,176 --> 01:08:45,242
Can't you feel it?

1172
01:08:45,244 --> 01:08:47,580
All that I feel is that
I'm starting to crack.

1173
01:08:49,382 --> 01:08:50,751
This is just so much to grasp.

1174
01:08:51,984 --> 01:08:53,387
How can you be so cool?

1175
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:57,054
Because some body has to.

1176
01:08:57,056 --> 01:08:58,121
That's it. I'm outta here.

1177
01:08:58,123 --> 01:08:59,659
If it's gone, so am I.

1178
01:09:09,002 --> 01:09:10,204
What are you doing?

1179
01:09:15,475 --> 01:09:16,476
I dunno.

1180
01:09:19,079 --> 01:09:20,280
Relax, Johnny.

1181
01:09:20,946 --> 01:09:21,949
Everything's okay.

1182
01:09:25,784 --> 01:09:27,151
How can you be so cool?

1183
01:09:27,153 --> 01:09:28,618
Because everything's okay.

1184
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:30,690
He's gone, can't you feel it?

1185
01:09:31,757 --> 01:09:33,557
I can feel it.

1186
01:09:33,559 --> 01:09:35,428
We sent him back,
we did it, Johnny.

1187
01:09:36,561 --> 01:09:37,961
Then let's the hell out of here!

1188
01:09:37,963 --> 01:09:39,330
What are we waiting for?

1189
01:09:39,332 --> 01:09:41,799
No, we stay in here.

1190
01:09:41,801 --> 01:09:43,904
We just have a few more
hours left until sunrise.

1191
01:09:45,071 --> 01:09:46,203
We'll leave then.

1192
01:09:46,205 --> 01:09:47,304
It's gone!

1193
01:09:47,306 --> 01:09:49,006
Jonah's gone!

1194
01:09:49,008 --> 01:09:50,243
Can't you feel it?

1195
01:09:51,043 --> 01:09:52,511
No, we stay in here.

1196
01:09:52,945 --> 01:09:53,978
If it's gone,

1197
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:56,514
It's gone. I need to get
out of here, now!

1198
01:09:56,516 --> 01:09:58,282
No, just a few more hours.

1199
01:09:58,284 --> 01:10:00,420
It's gone, Barbara.

1200
01:10:02,221 --> 01:10:03,422
Don't you trust me?

1201
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:08,861
Then let's get the fuck
out of here.

1202
01:10:09,829 --> 01:10:10,831
Johnny.

1203
01:10:44,698 --> 01:10:45,699
He's gone.

1204
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,802
Come on, guys. Don't be afraid.

1205
01:10:50,736 --> 01:10:51,738
Jonah's gone.

1206
01:10:52,538 --> 01:10:53,739
Can't you feel it?

1207
01:11:01,381 --> 01:11:02,582
Jonah's gone away.

1208
01:11:18,297 --> 01:11:19,498
Come on, Johnny.

1209
01:11:20,367 --> 01:11:21,601
We made it through.

1210
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:32,611
He's not here, anymore.

1211
01:12:01,975 --> 01:12:02,976
See.

1212
01:12:04,744 --> 01:12:05,745
He's gone.

1213
01:12:06,913 --> 01:12:07,914
No Jonah anymore.

1214
01:12:09,615 --> 01:12:10,816
Can't you feel it?

1215
01:12:14,186 --> 01:12:15,689
I'm surprised you can't feel it.

1216
01:12:17,457 --> 01:12:18,889
We made it.

1217
01:12:18,891 --> 01:12:20,057
We fucking made it.

1218
01:12:20,059 --> 01:12:21,061
Stop.

1219
01:12:21,994 --> 01:12:23,028
Let's go.

1220
01:12:26,231 --> 01:12:27,434
Don't.

1221
01:12:32,038 --> 01:12:33,073
Don't go.

1222
01:12:35,807 --> 01:12:36,810
Nope.

1223
01:12:37,744 --> 01:12:38,745
Nobody here.

1224
01:12:41,547 --> 01:12:42,748
What are you waiting for?

1225
01:12:44,984 --> 01:12:45,986
- Let's go.
- No.

1226
01:13:13,378 --> 01:13:15,681
Here's Jonah.

1227
01:13:25,056 --> 01:13:26,659
What are you doing!

1228
01:13:35,467 --> 01:13:36,769
Come and get them, Jonah.

1229
01:13:51,617 --> 01:13:54,085
Jesus, why's he still here?

1230
01:13:54,087 --> 01:13:55,752
Guys, come on, scream,
make so me noise.

1231
01:13:55,754 --> 01:13:57,086
Somebody's gonna hear us.

1232
01:13:57,088 --> 01:13:59,189
Help! Guys, come on!

1233
01:13:59,191 --> 01:14:00,323
Help!

1234
01:14:00,325 --> 01:14:02,026
Help!

1235
01:14:02,028 --> 01:14:03,126
Somebody help!

1236
01:14:03,128 --> 01:14:04,929
Somebody!

1237
01:14:04,931 --> 01:14:07,000
Help! Help! Help.

1238
01:14:09,668 --> 01:14:11,169
Can anybody hear us?

1239
01:14:11,171 --> 01:14:12,835
Help! Help! Come on!

1240
01:14:12,837 --> 01:14:14,471
Hail Mary full of grace.

1241
01:14:15,675 --> 01:14:17,308
Blessed is the tuitty fruit

1242
01:14:17,310 --> 01:14:18,709
of your womb.

1243
01:14:18,711 --> 01:14:20,113
Stop laughing at me!

1244
01:14:21,346 --> 01:14:23,182
If you wanna go die, go die!

1245
01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:27,050
Come on guys, don't stop,
keep screaming.

1246
01:14:27,052 --> 01:14:28,854
Help! Guys!

1247
01:14:30,623 --> 01:14:33,193
What are you guys doing?
Don't stop. Keep screaming.

1248
01:14:34,961 --> 01:14:35,962
My head hurts.

1249
01:14:37,262 --> 01:14:38,265
I'm not screaming.

1250
01:14:39,632 --> 01:14:41,197
Why doesn't anybody hear us?

1251
01:15:31,684 --> 01:15:32,886
One Mississippi.

1252
01:15:34,119 --> 01:15:35,120
Two Mississippi.

1253
01:15:35,387 --> 01:15:36,487
Help!

1254
01:15:36,489 --> 01:15:37,587
Three Mississippi.

1255
01:15:37,589 --> 01:15:38,723
Anyone!

1256
01:15:38,725 --> 01:15:40,160
Four Mississippi.

1257
01:15:41,193 --> 01:15:42,361
Five Mississippi.

1258
01:15:43,562 --> 01:15:44,797
Six Mississippi.

1259
01:15:45,597 --> 01:15:46,865
Seven Mississippi.

1260
01:15:51,302 --> 01:15:52,771
Lydia, what are you doing?

1261
01:15:54,173 --> 01:15:55,240
What are you doing? Don't!

1262
01:16:03,214 --> 01:16:04,351
Come, Jonah.

1263
01:16:20,165 --> 01:16:21,668
Take me away with you.

1264
01:17:12,551 --> 01:17:14,254
Don't look at him.

1265
01:19:32,458 --> 01:19:33,893
You piece of shit.

1266
01:19:35,927 --> 01:19:37,129
You really are nothing.

1267
01:19:42,802 --> 01:19:44,003
Back to hell.

1268
01:20:25,377 --> 01:20:26,379
No!

1269
01:21:50,329 --> 01:21:51,228
Oh, my god!

1270
01:25:27,812 --> 01:25:28,814
Oh!

1271
01:25:31,348 --> 01:25:33,782
Wha... what... oh, my god.

1272
01:25:33,784 --> 01:25:34,917
Oh, my god.

1273
01:25:34,919 --> 01:25:36,152
Oh, honey.

1274
01:25:36,154 --> 01:25:37,487
Honey, what happened?

1275
01:25:37,489 --> 01:25:38,988
Oh, easy.

1276
01:25:38,990 --> 01:25:40,322
Easy, I got you, honey.

1277
01:25:40,324 --> 01:25:42,358
