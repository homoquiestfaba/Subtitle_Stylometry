it was weird
that a mountain floats

535

when there's obviously

536
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,221
some invisible force
pulling us downward

537
00:20:22,223 --> 00:20:23,419

around us

538
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:25,953

But that's why
we haven't found one up here.

down there!

doesn't exist?

that it actually does?
