1
00:00:10,361 --> 00:00:12,154
<i>You know what it's like there, Patrick.</i>

2
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:15,407
<i>These girls, man, they come down from</i>
<i>the States when they're done with school.</i>

3
00:00:15,532 --> 00:00:18,243
<i>They're ready to cut loose, man,</i>
<i>ready to party.</i>

4
00:00:19,536 --> 00:00:24,416
<i>So, this girl, Natalee?</i>

5
00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:27,461
<i>She was just this girl</i>
<i>hanging out with her friends.</i>

6
00:00:27,586 --> 00:00:29,421
<i>I wasn't really into her that much,</i>

7
00:00:29,546 --> 00:00:31,715
<i>but she wanted a drink,</i>
<i>and I'm like, "Why not?" You know?</i>

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,841
<i>Yeah.</i>

9
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:36,053
<i>Then the place closed,</i>
<i>and she asked me for a ride.</i>

10
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:38,013
<i>So you gave her a ride.</i>

11
00:00:39,264 --> 00:00:41,642
<i>It was the gentleman thing to do.</i>

12
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:55,781
Okay, so far, we have 132 students
signed up for the trip

13
00:00:55,906 --> 00:00:58,450
and seven chaperones, including myself.

14
00:00:58,575 --> 00:01:00,786
Now, notice I didn't say "babysitters".

15
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:03,080
Now, we won't be doing head counts
or bed checks.

16
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:09,002
We're there for emergencies
and to do a little gambling in the casinos.

17
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:10,337
Which reminds me,

18
00:01:10,462 --> 00:01:14,174
if you don't want your child to lose
all of his or her college money,

19
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:17,803
don't send them
with a whole lot of cash or ATM cards.

20
00:01:18,137 --> 00:01:22,349
The legal gambling age is 18,
and so is the drinking age.

21
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:26,186
I was hoping your father
would chip in on this.

22
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:27,771
He says it's too extravagant.

23
00:01:27,896 --> 00:01:31,275
Honestly, Natalee, you did us both a favour
by getting that scholarship.

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,986
We don't have to put in a cent for tuition.

25
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:36,155
He could spare a dollar or two.

26
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,950
Mom, he's gonna give me $500
as a graduation present.

27
00:01:40,242 --> 00:01:42,244
So, Natalee's going, right?

28
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,747
Yeah, because I told her,
if it's a money thing,

29
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:48,459
maybe I could ask my dad
if he could, you know, help out.

30
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:52,296
If anyone deserves to go on this trip,
it's Natalee.

31
00:01:53,464 --> 00:01:54,965
She's going.

32
00:01:55,424 --> 00:01:58,218
If I have to move heaven and earth,
she's going.

33
00:01:58,343 --> 00:01:59,762
Aruba!

34
00:02:01,597 --> 00:02:03,599
- How's it fit?
- It fits.

35
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:07,186
- Well, come out and let me see it.
- Why are you in such a hurry?

36
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:09,938
I told you, I have a meeting
with one of my students' parents.

37
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:12,483
Aren't teachers supposed to have
Saturdays off?

38
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:17,029
Well, kids with special needs
usually have parents with special schedules.

39
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:21,367
What do you think of this
for the Kappa Delta tea?

40
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:24,453
You look like a dish of ice cream.

41
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,877
- For Aruba?
- You already have two bathing suits.

42
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:33,712
You're only gonna be there
three and a half days.

43
00:02:33,837 --> 00:02:36,215
But I'm gonna be swimming all the time.

44
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,092
You do not need that.

45
00:02:38,717 --> 00:02:39,718
Mom.

46
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:44,056
Imagine having to put on a wet bathing suit
full of sand.

47
00:02:44,181 --> 00:02:46,016
Imagine the chafing.

48
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:48,352
Go on, try it on.

49
00:02:49,228 --> 00:02:52,022
I don't know why you decided to be a doctor.

50
00:02:52,147 --> 00:02:54,608
Being a lawyer is obviously your calling.

51
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:05,035
Hey, honey. Did you grab the mail?

52
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,870
No, I did not.

53
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:10,165
Don't see any need to hurry
and count my bills.

54
00:03:10,499 --> 00:03:12,334
- Matt, can you grab the mail?
- Okay, Mom.

55
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,336
Hey, Jug, like my dress?

56
00:03:14,753 --> 00:03:17,798
She went shopping today. Thanks, honey.

57
00:03:17,923 --> 00:03:20,634
For rush week, sorority teas.

58
00:03:21,093 --> 00:03:24,513
You trying to impress the girls with
that dress or turn the heads of the boys?

59
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:27,641
The girls are much harder to impress,
believe me.

60
00:03:27,766 --> 00:03:30,561
I have to e-mail a picture of this dress
to Hayley.

61
00:03:30,686 --> 00:03:32,980
You know what her daddy would say
about a dress that short.

62
00:03:33,105 --> 00:03:35,315
Well, what he doesn't know won't hurt him.

63
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,234
Thanks, Jug.

64
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:40,529
Seems like the smaller the dress,
the bigger the price tag.

65
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:43,949
Well, if that's what it takes
to get into a good sorority,

66
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:46,118
then that's what it takes.

67
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:06,680
- You're way late.
- It's not my fault.

68
00:04:06,805 --> 00:04:09,683
My dad took me out to lunch
and sapped on me.

69
00:04:09,808 --> 00:04:14,646
"My little girl's going off to college.
I'm gonna be left all alone, poor me."

70
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,442
Did you tell him his little girl's going
to prom tonight with Daniel Slocum?

71
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:19,610
No.

72
00:04:19,735 --> 00:04:24,031
He would lock me in my room
and sit on the front porch with his shotgun.

73
00:04:24,156 --> 00:04:27,117
- Sounds like my dad.
- Your dad's a whole state over.

74
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:30,329
At least I don't tell him big fat lies
about who's taking me to prom.

75
00:04:30,454 --> 00:04:33,749
At least I don't let my mom set me up
with someone I don't even like.

76
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,834
I like Troy fine.

77
00:04:36,668 --> 00:04:38,087
He'll dance with me.

78
00:04:38,504 --> 00:04:41,131
Daniel won't dance. Might mess up his hair.

79
00:04:41,256 --> 00:04:45,761
He has got the most gorgeous curly hair.
It is like art.

80
00:04:46,345 --> 00:04:48,097
I'm so bummed he's not going to Aruba.

81
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:50,683
I'm sure there'll be plenty of guys there
with good hair.

82
00:04:50,808 --> 00:04:53,477
Like you'd notice, Little Miss Picky Pants.

83
00:04:53,602 --> 00:04:55,813
Hey, just 'cause I'm not a slut like you...

84
00:04:55,938 --> 00:04:59,149
I am not a slut. You are so...

85
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:02,194
- I know we've already had the boy talk.
- About five times.

86
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,489
- Well, let's just have it one more time.
- I don't need a boy talk for Troy.

87
00:05:05,614 --> 00:05:08,534
Honey, boys suddenly can look
very different on the dance floor,

88
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:10,577
especially after you've had a drink or two.

89
00:05:10,703 --> 00:05:13,080
- We're not gonna be drinking, Mom.
- Really?

90
00:05:13,205 --> 00:05:16,583
Well, things have really changed
since I went to prom.

91
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:18,085
We don't have to drink tonight.

92
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,504
We'll be in Aruba next week.
We can drink there.

93
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:22,673
Prom, Aruba, same thing.

94
00:05:22,798 --> 00:05:25,801
You have to be careful
around boys and alcohol.

95
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:27,678
They're liable to take advantage.

96
00:05:27,803 --> 00:05:30,347
I know, Mom. I know, okay?

97
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:34,685
And I promise you, I'm always careful.
Okay?

98
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:35,978
I know.

99
00:05:37,896 --> 00:05:42,860
Look at you. You look so beautiful.

100
00:05:43,485 --> 00:05:45,237
I wish I had a real date.

101
00:05:45,362 --> 00:05:47,281
I wish I could find
someone I actually liked.

102
00:05:47,406 --> 00:05:50,284
You have all the time in the world for that.

103
00:05:54,913 --> 00:05:56,707
- Hey, come on, guys.
- We're coming. We're coming.

104
00:05:56,832 --> 00:05:58,709
- Make way for the graduate.
- I got to go.

105
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:00,669
I'm taking your car.
Promise me you won't be late.

106
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,713
Just one picture. Come on, photo op.

107
00:06:02,838 --> 00:06:03,839
Get next to your sister, Matt.

108
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,466
All right, get a little closer. Come on.
Squeeze in.

109
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:07,051
Scoot over, Matt.

110
00:06:07,718 --> 00:06:09,678
- Matt, you just stepped on my foot.
- Sorry.

111
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:12,765
- Big smiles.
- One, two, three.

112
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:22,691
Mom! Why are you still asleep?
You said you'd get up at 4:00!

113
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,402
- I'm getting up right now.
- Come on, we're gonna be late.

114
00:06:25,527 --> 00:06:26,528
Honey, I promise you,

115
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,864
Hayley's mom won't leave for the airport
without you.

116
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,920
Did you remember to put your sunscreen
in a plastic bag

117
00:06:43,045 --> 00:06:44,588
so it doesn't spill all over your stuff?

118
00:06:44,713 --> 00:06:46,256
- It's not gonna spill.
- I hope not.

119
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:48,509
I'd hate to see all your nice new clothes
get ruined.

120
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:50,386
Mom, it's not gonna spill.

121
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:54,890
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- I hope you have the best, best time.

122
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:57,851
I will. And you have fun at the lake.

123
00:06:59,812 --> 00:07:02,523
- I love you, Mom.
- And I love you, baby.

124
00:07:20,082 --> 00:07:22,084
Hi, Nat. Come on in.

125
00:07:54,783 --> 00:07:57,286
- Oh, my gosh.
- I am loving Aruba already.

126
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:00,831
- Cheers?
- Cheers.

127
00:08:12,176 --> 00:08:14,470
This is my bed. Who's sleeping with me?

128
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:15,637
Me!

129
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,144
Look how close the pool is.

130
00:08:22,811 --> 00:08:23,854
I dare you.

131
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,984
They're crazy.

132
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,012
Body shot!

133
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:06,480
You so have to take a body shot off me.

134
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:14,863
Stop.

135
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:18,283
- Knock it off!
- Stuck-up bitch.

136
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:21,078
- Leave her alone.
- Hey, take it easy.

137
00:09:21,203 --> 00:09:23,038
- Okay, okay.
- Back off!

138
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,624
Oh, my God. We just started a bar fight.

139
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:34,216
Here's to good friends,

140
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:37,469
and here's to Maggie's mom
for letting us use the house.

141
00:09:37,594 --> 00:09:38,637
Yeah.

142
00:09:38,762 --> 00:09:41,306
This is the best vacation I've had
in a really long time.

143
00:09:41,432 --> 00:09:44,727
And here's to our kids getting old enough
to take their own vacation.

144
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:45,894
Amen.

145
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,651
No, I'm just really surprised,
because I thought for sure

146
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:55,446
that you were gonna be crawled up
in a big old ball of empty-nest syndrome

147
00:09:55,571 --> 00:09:56,572
when Natalee went off to college.

148
00:09:56,697 --> 00:10:00,659
I still have Matt,
and I love my little girl, but she is work.

149
00:10:00,784 --> 00:10:04,621
I am looking forward to a nice,
quiet nest for a while.

150
00:10:04,747 --> 00:10:06,874
You are so faking it.

151
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:09,460
You hush up and have some more wine.

152
00:10:10,502 --> 00:10:13,297
Well, I'm not faking it.
I got two out the door, three more to go.

153
00:10:13,422 --> 00:10:15,507
So here's to the empty nest.

154
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:23,265
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

155
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:25,934
I thought you were going snorkelling
again today.

156
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,896
Yeah, we tried,
but we had to get off the boat.

157
00:10:29,021 --> 00:10:30,439
She's got herself a hangover.

158
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:33,275
Isn't she cute?
Our little Natty's growing up.

159
00:10:34,193 --> 00:10:37,029
I'm never drinking again, ever.

160
00:10:37,154 --> 00:10:38,489
Are you kidding me?

161
00:10:38,614 --> 00:10:41,784
You're going to U of A. Huge party school.

162
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,494
- And you are drinking tonight.
- No, I'm not.

163
00:10:43,619 --> 00:10:45,621
Yes, you are. It's our last night.

164
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:49,291
Come on, the best cure for a hangover
is another drink.

165
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,918
It's not even noon yet.

166
00:10:51,335 --> 00:10:55,172
What's that saying,
"What happens in Aruba stays in Aruba"?

167
00:10:55,297 --> 00:10:57,049
It's Vegas, stupid.

168
00:10:57,174 --> 00:10:58,759
Well, it should be Aruba.

169
00:10:59,051 --> 00:11:01,095
Come on, Nat.

170
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,640
Last chance before you have to start
reading 30 pages a night

171
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:08,602
and dissecting goats and whatever else
you pre-med people have to do.

172
00:11:10,062 --> 00:11:11,772
- Come on.
- Yeah.

173
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,286
Cheers, Nat.

174
00:11:33,377 --> 00:11:35,337
Okay, come help me with this.

175
00:11:36,171 --> 00:11:39,675
Yes! I am not doomed!

176
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,635
Right. Let's go again.

177
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,138
What are you doing?
Aren't we going to Carlos'n Charlie's?

178
00:11:44,263 --> 00:11:45,472
Yeah, in a minute.

179
00:11:45,597 --> 00:11:48,684
This guy is just helping me win back
the money I lost last night.

180
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,019
What'd you say your name was again?

181
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:51,478
- Joran.
- Where you from?

182
00:11:51,603 --> 00:11:55,315
I'm a student at university in Holland,
but this is the place to be in the summer.

183
00:11:56,275 --> 00:11:57,317
I'll drink to that.

184
00:11:57,443 --> 00:12:00,320
- Should I hit?
- Definitely. Hit fast and hard.

185
00:12:02,281 --> 00:12:03,323
Twenty-one.

186
00:12:03,782 --> 00:12:06,660
Oh, my gosh. You're such good luck.

187
00:12:06,785 --> 00:12:09,079
You just got to let the cards know
who's boss.

188
00:12:09,204 --> 00:12:12,374
- So, are we going or not?
- Yeah, we're going.

189
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,168
You want to come to Carlos'n Charlie's
with us?

190
00:12:14,293 --> 00:12:15,294
Lt'll be fun.

191
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:17,337
I don't know.
It's not that great on Sundays.

192
00:12:17,463 --> 00:12:19,965
Thanks for the help.
Now maybe my dad won't kill me.

193
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,091
We're out of here.

194
00:12:21,216 --> 00:12:22,801
Come on, let's go party.

195
00:12:24,094 --> 00:12:26,764
It's our last night. You should come.

196
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:40,778
Hello? Joran, hey. What's up?

197
00:12:40,903 --> 00:12:44,615
I just won a couple hundred at blackjack.
We're going out tonight, bitch.

198
00:12:48,577 --> 00:12:49,578
Here you go.

199
00:12:50,245 --> 00:12:52,456
Body shot!

200
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,461
Hey. Look who showed, the casino guy.

201
00:12:58,837 --> 00:13:00,714
Hey, casino guy.

202
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:04,593
- You like him?
- He's got good hair.

203
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,638
Waiting in the shop all day.

204
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,932
Were you working all day?

205
00:13:10,349 --> 00:13:12,059
So, why don't you come dance with us?

206
00:13:12,184 --> 00:13:13,894
I had to get a drink.
The bar's gonna close soon.

207
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:15,437
Then I better get another drink, too.

208
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:16,897
What do you want? I'll buy.

209
00:13:17,022 --> 00:13:19,483
I don't know. What's good?

210
00:13:19,608 --> 00:13:22,069
I need two shots. Can you handle it?

211
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:48,095
- So, do I just down it all at once?
- Go for it. All in one go.

212
00:13:55,644 --> 00:13:58,188
- I told you you'd like it.
- I need a chaser.

213
00:13:58,313 --> 00:14:00,441
Last call. Last call.

214
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,404
- Last call.
- So there's hope for her after all.

215
00:14:10,242 --> 00:14:13,537
So, do you want to take a body shot off me?

216
00:15:14,098 --> 00:15:16,684
Where you been, dude?
This place is closing up.

217
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:18,602
Joran's bringing that chick with him.

218
00:15:19,228 --> 00:15:20,604
- Satish.
- What?

219
00:15:20,729 --> 00:15:22,856
Just tell him we're not giving no chicks
a ride home.

220
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:25,901
Hey! Bye.

221
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,236
We're getting a cab.

222
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:30,322
We're going to the hotel, Hayley.
Is it okay?

223
00:15:30,948 --> 00:15:32,991
Hey. Have you seen Natalee?

224
00:15:33,701 --> 00:15:37,246
I think I saw her over there, somewhere...

225
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:39,832
I think she is getting in a taxi
with Brent and Justine.

226
00:15:39,957 --> 00:15:41,083
Are you sure?

227
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,210
Okay.

228
00:15:44,086 --> 00:15:49,216
Natalee! Hey! Nat! What are you doing?
Get out of that car.

229
00:15:49,591 --> 00:15:51,677
I'm going back to the hotel.

230
00:15:55,097 --> 00:15:56,223
Aruba!

231
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:02,855
Hey, guys, it's time to go.

232
00:16:04,481 --> 00:16:06,525
The bus leaves in an hour.

233
00:16:08,444 --> 00:16:09,820
Where were you?

234
00:16:10,446 --> 00:16:13,407
Brent and I and a couple of people
sat by the pool all night, talking.

235
00:16:15,826 --> 00:16:17,411
I look horrible.

236
00:16:18,162 --> 00:16:20,414
I hope I can sleep on the plane.

237
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:22,958
- Was Natalee with you guys?
- No.

238
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,461
Maybe she crashed in Leann's room.

239
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,964
I'm gonna go check her room.

240
00:16:30,507 --> 00:16:32,509
Can you call Coach Winter?

241
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:53,072
That's the sound of your vacation ending.

242
00:16:54,656 --> 00:16:55,783
Hello?

243
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:57,743
This is she.

244
00:16:59,244 --> 00:17:02,998
Jerry? Sure, I remember you, from school.

245
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:09,588
I don't understand.
Can you please say that again?

246
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:11,965
All right, have a safe flight, guys.

247
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,552
Brent, have a good flight.

248
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:17,930
Okay, bye-bye.

249
00:17:18,055 --> 00:17:20,557
I'm not leaving, not without Natalee.

250
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:22,267
Me, neither.

251
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:25,729
Look, I know. I wouldn't want
to take off without my best bud, either.

252
00:17:25,854 --> 00:17:29,191
But I can't rebook 130 kids
just because one of them's late.

253
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:31,610
She's not late. Natalee's never late.

254
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:34,113
Well, fine, distracted, whatever.

255
00:17:34,238 --> 00:17:37,658
Now, I'm sure she'll be showing up
at the hotel at any minute.

256
00:17:37,783 --> 00:17:39,868
I will be there to help
her on another flight.

257
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:43,539
But in the meantime,
you girls are not gonna miss your plane.

258
00:17:43,664 --> 00:17:47,793
Now, is that Natalee's backpack?
Think you better leave it with me.

259
00:17:50,421 --> 00:17:53,674
Hayley, it's okay.
I'll make sure she gets it.

260
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:56,385
Come on. Come on.

261
00:17:57,052 --> 00:17:59,722
Now, don't miss your plane. Come on, guys.

262
00:18:00,389 --> 00:18:02,016
Have a safe trip.

263
00:18:05,227 --> 00:18:06,895
Natalee, honey, it's Mom.

264
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:08,647
Will you call me as soon as you get this?

265
00:18:08,772 --> 00:18:11,442
They're telling me you didn't show up
for your flight home,

266
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:14,319
and, well,
I would really love to hear your voice.

267
00:18:14,445 --> 00:18:16,613
So, I hope everything's okay.

268
00:18:18,282 --> 00:18:21,368
Call information. Get the number
for the FBI office in Birmingham.

269
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:24,830
Beth, honey,
you're going like 100 miles an hour.

270
00:18:24,955 --> 00:18:25,956
Just pull over, okay?

271
00:18:26,081 --> 00:18:27,541
I am not pulling over.

272
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,293
Give me the phone.

273
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:40,095
911? I'm on Highway 78,
and my daughter has just been kidnapped.

274
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,263
I need to get home.

275
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:42,806
So will you please tell the officer

276
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:45,225
who's trying to get me to pull over
to back the hell off?

277
00:18:45,351 --> 00:18:47,686
Beth, will you please pull over?
You're scaring me.

278
00:18:49,188 --> 00:18:50,230
Fine.

279
00:18:58,697 --> 00:19:00,032
No. Beth...

280
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:04,036
Stop right there. Let me see your hands.

281
00:19:05,204 --> 00:19:07,790
Please, her daughter's been kidnapped.
We need help.

282
00:19:07,915 --> 00:19:09,666
Please, just help us.

283
00:19:11,377 --> 00:19:13,170
I'm on the phone with the hotel manager.

284
00:19:13,295 --> 00:19:15,130
He doesn't think we should head down there
just yet.

285
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:16,715
He says this kind of thing
happens all the time.

286
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,883
Tourists wander off.

287
00:19:18,008 --> 00:19:20,302
Natalee didn't just wander off.

288
00:19:20,928 --> 00:19:22,554
I talked to Hayley.

289
00:19:23,347 --> 00:19:27,893
She said Natalee was driven off
by three guys in a grey car.

290
00:19:29,144 --> 00:19:32,064
Hayley told me she was on her way
back to the hotel.

291
00:19:32,189 --> 00:19:34,233
Did you hear that?

292
00:19:34,358 --> 00:19:36,443
No, no. Tonight. Right now.

293
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:38,904
No. No, thank you.

294
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:40,572
We have a friend that's gonna let us
use his plane.

295
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:47,037
Okay. Did you talk to your father?

296
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:51,333
Yeah. He said he's gonna go down
tomorrow unless you find her before.

297
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:54,586
All right, honey.
I'll call you when we get there.

298
00:19:54,712 --> 00:19:56,630
- I love you.
- I love you.

299
00:20:11,729 --> 00:20:12,896
Jerry.

300
00:20:14,064 --> 00:20:16,233
Did Natalee show up yet?
Have you found her?

301
00:20:16,358 --> 00:20:17,693
I'm sorry, no.

302
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:19,820
Now, I tried to file a
report with the police,

303
00:20:19,945 --> 00:20:23,699
but they won't consider her a missing
person until she's been gone 48 hours.

304
00:20:24,074 --> 00:20:26,952
Well, then,
we'll just have to find her ourselves.

305
00:20:29,705 --> 00:20:33,250
Excuse me. This is my daughter, Natalee.
She's missing.

306
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:37,713
- She was last seen with a young man who...
- What's going on? Ma'am?

307
00:20:37,963 --> 00:20:39,923
Yes, this is my daughter, Natalee.

308
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:44,428
She's missing and she was last seen with
a young man who might be a guest here.

309
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,599
His name is Jaren or Joran.

310
00:20:48,724 --> 00:20:52,269
He has dark hair. Maybe 6 feet tall.

311
00:20:52,394 --> 00:20:55,856
- You are talking about Joran van der Sloot.
- You know him?

312
00:20:55,981 --> 00:20:58,525
Well, he comes into the casino
couple of times a week,

313
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,319
but he's not a guest.

314
00:21:00,444 --> 00:21:02,988
He's a local. Lives not far from here.

315
00:21:11,246 --> 00:21:12,373
Thank you for coming.

316
00:21:12,498 --> 00:21:13,582
We can give you the name of the witness

317
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:16,960
who saw my daughter get into the car
with Joran van der Sloot.

318
00:21:17,086 --> 00:21:19,380
We're not investigators,
if you hear what I'm saying.

319
00:21:19,505 --> 00:21:22,007
We'll talk to him ourselves
if you can get us past that gate.

320
00:21:22,132 --> 00:21:23,509
No worries.

321
00:21:39,817 --> 00:21:43,362
- I want you to wait in the car.
- Why? I have the right to ask.

322
00:21:43,487 --> 00:21:46,573
We don't even know if he has a gun
or how this thing's gonna go down.

323
00:21:46,699 --> 00:21:47,908
Humour me.

324
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:54,707
Hate to be disturbing you, sir,

325
00:21:54,832 --> 00:21:58,210
but it seems that
we have a bit of a sticky situation.

326
00:22:02,423 --> 00:22:04,800
This is my stepdaughter. She's missing.

327
00:22:05,217 --> 00:22:07,511
She was last seen with your son.

328
00:22:08,387 --> 00:22:10,431
Hurry. They're all waiting.

329
00:22:13,225 --> 00:22:15,978
Joran says he's coming around the corner.

330
00:22:37,249 --> 00:22:38,751
Dad, what's going on?

331
00:22:38,876 --> 00:22:41,879
This girl, she's my stepdaughter.
Where is she?

332
00:22:42,004 --> 00:22:43,589
I don't understand.
Why would I know where she is?

333
00:22:43,714 --> 00:22:45,382
Her friend saw you with her

334
00:22:45,507 --> 00:22:48,927
getting into that car last night
at Carlos'n Charlie's.

335
00:22:51,722 --> 00:22:54,224
Yes, I know. That's the girl
I was drinking with at the bar.

336
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,976
And then she asked us
for a ride back to her hotel.

337
00:22:56,101 --> 00:22:58,228
You think this is funny, son?

338
00:23:03,525 --> 00:23:05,903
All right. Then you show us.

339
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:08,655
You get your ass in that car,
and you show us where.

340
00:23:08,781 --> 00:23:10,366
You don't have to do anything.

341
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:12,993
I am an attorney.

342
00:23:13,118 --> 00:23:15,788
- You have not one bit of jurisdiction here.
- Dad, it's cool.

343
00:23:15,913 --> 00:23:18,582
We have no problem helping them out.
Right, Deepak?

344
00:23:21,543 --> 00:23:23,587
This is where we dropped her.

345
00:23:23,712 --> 00:23:25,381
What do you think, Deepak, right here?

346
00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:27,257
It's true. We left her here.

347
00:23:27,383 --> 00:23:29,301
She was so drunk,
she could hardly get out the car.

348
00:23:38,477 --> 00:23:40,938
Hey, do you need help?

349
00:23:45,484 --> 00:23:48,362
- Are you okay, miss?
- No, no. I'm fine.

350
00:23:50,531 --> 00:23:52,825
So, you're saying she hit her head
and fell down,

351
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,411
and you didn't even get out of the car
and help her?

352
00:23:55,536 --> 00:23:57,913
The security guy, he helped her.

353
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:02,126
So where is she? I want her back.
I want my daughter back.

354
00:24:02,251 --> 00:24:06,171
What do you want me to do now?
We left her here.

355
00:24:06,296 --> 00:24:07,965
What do you want me to do?

356
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,969
You've answered their questions. It's late.
We're going home.

357
00:24:14,013 --> 00:24:17,349
You're just gonna let them go?
Why don't you search their car?

358
00:24:17,474 --> 00:24:19,977
Mr van der Sloot there
is in line to be a judge.

359
00:24:20,102 --> 00:24:22,104
I'm not in the mood to piss him off.

360
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:24,773
If you ask me,
your daughter is sleeping it off somewhere.

361
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:26,025
Give it a day or two.

362
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,695
She'll show up red in the face.
Then she'll be in some real trouble, huh?

363
00:24:52,301 --> 00:24:55,095
Thank you for letting us have her room.

364
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,057
She could come back here,
and I just want to make sure we're here

365
00:24:58,182 --> 00:25:00,017
in case she comes back.

366
00:25:03,062 --> 00:25:05,939
- The teacher asked us to hold it.
- Thank you.

367
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:14,782
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- I hope you have the best, best time.

368
00:25:14,907 --> 00:25:16,075
I will.

369
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,747
Her cell phone. She didn't have it with her.

370
00:25:21,872 --> 00:25:23,957
Why would she just leave it?

371
00:25:26,627 --> 00:25:28,712
It didn't work here, did it?

372
00:25:29,004 --> 00:25:32,007
Her phone didn't have international calling.
I never...

373
00:25:32,132 --> 00:25:36,595
I never... I should have... Oh, my God.

374
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:40,307
Oh, my God. She doesn't have a phone.

375
00:25:40,766 --> 00:25:46,355
She could be lying in an alley somewhere,
hurt, or locked up in a room by a maniac

376
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,483
- doing God knows what to her...
- Hey, listen to me. Listen to me. Hey!

377
00:25:50,317 --> 00:25:53,237
Natalee is the most strong-willed person
on the planet.

378
00:25:53,362 --> 00:25:55,739
She'll hold on until we find her,

379
00:25:55,864 --> 00:25:59,076
or she'll find us
and scold us for taking too long.

380
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:02,121
It's gonna be fine.

381
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,881
So, another tourist misses their flight.

382
00:26:14,466 --> 00:26:17,469
I can grab their statement
if you don't want to deal with it.

383
00:26:17,594 --> 00:26:21,390
Haven't you got the phone records
to get through for the Patel case?

384
00:26:22,474 --> 00:26:24,393
Thanks for reminding me.

385
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,562
Excuse me, Detective.

386
00:26:26,687 --> 00:26:28,564
We were wondering if the officers
who were with us last night

387
00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:29,982
filled you in on what happened.

388
00:26:30,107 --> 00:26:32,067
What the van der Sloot kid said.

389
00:26:32,192 --> 00:26:33,569
Yeah, yeah.

390
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:35,237
I'll be wanting your statements on that.

391
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:39,491
But first I'm gonna eat my Frosted Flakes,
and I need a shave.

392
00:26:56,884 --> 00:26:59,595
How much longer can they keep us waiting?

393
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,125
This is unbearable.

394
00:27:33,587 --> 00:27:34,880
Excuse me.

395
00:27:35,673 --> 00:27:38,550
I've been waiting two hours
for the detective to get back.

396
00:27:38,676 --> 00:27:40,260
I don't understand.

397
00:27:40,386 --> 00:27:43,681
Doesn't anyone in this building care
that my daughter is missing?

398
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:46,433
I can try him on his cell.

399
00:27:50,145 --> 00:27:51,397
Sneijder.

400
00:27:53,315 --> 00:27:56,110
Tell them we won't be needing them today.

401
00:27:59,655 --> 00:28:01,615
- Hey.
- What?

402
00:28:01,865 --> 00:28:03,534
I have to go take a leak.

403
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:06,745
You're gonna sit down
until Frank is finished with you.

404
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:12,793
There's something wrong with these people.

405
00:28:12,918 --> 00:28:15,838
We need to go to the American consulate
and get someone to light a fire under them.

406
00:28:15,963 --> 00:28:17,631
Excuse me.

407
00:28:17,756 --> 00:28:20,592
Diana Peterson,
Aruba 10 News in Oranjestad.

408
00:28:20,718 --> 00:28:21,885
If you want to find your daughter,

409
00:28:22,011 --> 00:28:24,096
I am the one who can help you
get the word out.

410
00:28:25,514 --> 00:28:29,309
I have a 16-year-old daughter.
Please, let me help you.

411
00:28:38,777 --> 00:28:40,988
What are you doing?
They said we had to be there by 2:00.

412
00:28:41,155 --> 00:28:42,656
Do you want us to get arrested?

413
00:28:42,823 --> 00:28:45,325
That's the girl's mother.
She's going on the news.

414
00:28:46,577 --> 00:28:48,746
This is turning into a freaking nightmare.

415
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:53,959
Dave.

416
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,337
Hi, Beth. Hi, Jug.

417
00:28:57,463 --> 00:28:58,839
- You just get in?
- Yeah, just got in.

418
00:28:58,964 --> 00:29:02,468
This is Brian and Mitch.
They're here to help. Any news?

419
00:29:02,593 --> 00:29:04,303
Not a damn thing.
We're getting nowhere with the cops.

420
00:29:04,428 --> 00:29:06,680
I guess we better get out there
and start looking.

421
00:29:06,972 --> 00:29:09,850
We just stopped by a copy store
to order some posters.

422
00:29:09,975 --> 00:29:11,226
Excuse me.

423
00:29:11,352 --> 00:29:14,688
This is Barbara Waxman,
with the US State Department.

424
00:29:14,813 --> 00:29:17,900
This is Beth and Jug Twitty,
Natalee's parents.

425
00:29:18,317 --> 00:29:21,028
Actually, Dave here is Natalee's father.

426
00:29:22,404 --> 00:29:23,530
Hello.

427
00:29:24,198 --> 00:29:26,825
I was so sorry to hear
about your daughter missing her plane.

428
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:29,203
Well, maybe you can tell us
why the police don't seem to be interested

429
00:29:29,328 --> 00:29:30,913
in helping us find our girl.

430
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:33,540
Well, it hasn't been 48 hours yet.

431
00:29:33,665 --> 00:29:36,043
I don't know how many times
tourists stretch out their vacation

432
00:29:36,168 --> 00:29:37,669
and forget to tell the folks at home.

433
00:29:37,795 --> 00:29:40,297
With all due respect,
you don't know who you're talking about.

434
00:29:40,422 --> 00:29:42,966
- My daughter is not like that.
- I don't know what she's like at home,

435
00:29:43,092 --> 00:29:47,096
but I do know that a lot of young people
end up in choller houses.

436
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,432
Crack houses,
they're completely legal and...

437
00:29:50,557 --> 00:29:53,143
No, no. My daughter is very anti-drugs.

438
00:29:53,268 --> 00:29:55,979
Not all tourists end up there voluntarily.

439
00:29:56,105 --> 00:29:58,565
Sometimes they're taken there, kept there

440
00:29:58,691 --> 00:30:01,735
until the addicts drain their accounts
with their ATM cards.

441
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,487
What the hell kind of place is this?

442
00:30:03,612 --> 00:30:06,073
I told her not to come. I told you.

443
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:08,909
I think I'm giving you
the wrong impression here.

444
00:30:09,034 --> 00:30:10,202
This isn't a bad place.

445
00:30:10,327 --> 00:30:14,873
I've been here nine years, and no tourist
has ever been seriously hurt or...

446
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:18,627
Look, I know you're scared.
So, don't wait for the police.

447
00:30:18,752 --> 00:30:21,255
This is a small island.
Everybody knows everybody.

448
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,882
If you just start asking around,
you're going to find your daughter.

449
00:30:24,383 --> 00:30:25,509
I promise you.

450
00:30:38,731 --> 00:30:39,732
Thank you.

451
00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:02,671
The club is closed,

452
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:09,595
then the girl gets in the backseat
with Joran, and then you drive off.

453
00:31:10,804 --> 00:31:13,682
And her friend was yelling at her
to get out of the car.

454
00:31:14,016 --> 00:31:17,519
Nat! What are you doing?
Get out of that car.

455
00:31:17,644 --> 00:31:20,397
I'm going back to the hotel.

456
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:23,317
Aruba!

457
00:31:26,987 --> 00:31:29,198
I can pull over if you want to go back
with your friends.

458
00:31:29,615 --> 00:31:31,617
Screw that, man. We can give her a ride.

459
00:31:31,742 --> 00:31:33,327
She's drunk. It's too much trouble.

460
00:31:33,452 --> 00:31:36,789
Shut up. She wants to go, so let's go.

461
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:42,878
I want to go see the sharks.

462
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:45,464
There's no sharks.
Come on, Deepak, just keep going.

463
00:31:45,589 --> 00:31:47,299
There are so sharks.

464
00:31:47,424 --> 00:31:49,510
At the lighthouse, someone told me.

465
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,138
Okay, so we'll take you to the lighthouse,
right, Satish?

466
00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:54,807
Right.

467
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:00,104
- I want to kiss you.
- So kiss me.

468
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,154
Excuse me. Have you seen this girl?
She's missing.

469
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,032
- No, sorry.
- She was here just a few nights ago.

470
00:32:13,075 --> 00:32:16,453
Excuse me. Have you seen this girl?
She's missing. She's my daughter.

471
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:21,083
Excuse me. Have you seen this girl?

472
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:23,877
She was here a few nights ago.
She's missing. She's my...

473
00:32:24,002 --> 00:32:27,214
Have you seen this girl?
She was here just a few nights ago.

474
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:32,344
Let's go back to the hotel.
I'm gonna get some food in you.

475
00:32:32,469 --> 00:32:34,972
No. Natalee may be someplace
where she can't eat,

476
00:32:35,097 --> 00:32:37,057
and if she can't eat, then I'm not eating.

477
00:32:37,182 --> 00:32:39,018
And if she's not sleeping, then I'm not...

478
00:32:39,143 --> 00:32:40,894
- Excuse me. Have you seen this girl?
- Beth? Beth?

479
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,564
- She's missing. She's my daughter.
- You're not gonna do her any good

480
00:32:43,689 --> 00:32:46,400
- if you run yourself ragged.
- Don't even bother.

481
00:32:49,236 --> 00:32:53,032
This is Beth. Yes, yes, I'm her mother.

482
00:32:53,741 --> 00:32:56,076
What? Where?

483
00:32:57,369 --> 00:32:58,787
There she is.

484
00:32:58,996 --> 00:33:01,457
By the anchor, just like they said.

485
00:33:04,293 --> 00:33:05,544
Natalee!

486
00:33:08,255 --> 00:33:11,050
Natalee! Natalee!

487
00:33:15,262 --> 00:33:16,555
I'm sorry.

488
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:18,891
Oh, baby.

489
00:33:47,461 --> 00:33:50,547
- What colour is your daughter's hair?
- She's blond.

490
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:54,343
- And what colour are her eyes?
- Blue.

491
00:33:57,054 --> 00:34:00,683
And does she have any history
of seizures or epilepsy?

492
00:34:00,808 --> 00:34:04,269
No. What... Why are you asking me this?

493
00:34:04,728 --> 00:34:07,356
I thought you wanted to ask me
about Joran van der Sloot.

494
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:09,108
He told some of the kids
on the trip with Natalee

495
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:12,736
he was a university student in Holland,
here on vacation. He lied.

496
00:34:13,153 --> 00:34:16,699
Local boys often pretend to be tourists.
It makes it easier for them.

497
00:34:16,824 --> 00:34:19,034
Easier for them to what?

498
00:34:20,536 --> 00:34:22,371
Meet some girls, have some fun.

499
00:34:22,496 --> 00:34:24,998
Is that what Joran and the Kalpoes told you?

500
00:34:25,124 --> 00:34:27,000
That they took my daughter
to have some fun?

501
00:34:27,126 --> 00:34:30,170
No, no, no, no. Their statements all agree.

502
00:34:30,295 --> 00:34:33,549
They drove around for a while, and then
they dropped her off back at the hotel.

503
00:34:33,674 --> 00:34:37,302
- And you believe them?
- There's no evidence to suggest otherwise.

504
00:34:37,428 --> 00:34:40,723
Look, we're tracking down
the security guards from the hotel.

505
00:34:40,848 --> 00:34:42,057
We'll find out which one talked to her,

506
00:34:42,182 --> 00:34:45,686
and maybe he saw her
get into another car or wander off.

507
00:34:46,186 --> 00:34:48,480
This island, it's very safe.

508
00:34:48,605 --> 00:34:52,526
Tourists get lost all the time, you know,
for a week. They always turn up.

509
00:34:52,651 --> 00:34:56,155
If someone tells me that one more time,
I am gonna lose my mind.

510
00:34:58,449 --> 00:35:00,784
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

511
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:02,870
Who's stupid?

512
00:35:03,328 --> 00:35:07,207
Joran told Terry the whole thing,
about the Natalee chick.

513
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:10,753
Terry just e-mailed me
asking if I got a piece of that.

514
00:35:10,878 --> 00:35:13,005
And what are you telling him?

515
00:35:13,505 --> 00:35:18,844
I'm saying, "Yeah, mofo. She put her hands
all the way down in my pants."

516
00:35:19,303 --> 00:35:20,304
Why are you telling him that?

517
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:39,573
You have a DVD player in your car?

518
00:35:40,908 --> 00:35:43,118
Are you guys rich?

519
00:35:43,243 --> 00:35:44,953
- Yeah, we're rich.
- Yeah, we're rich.

520
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:49,500
You're kidding. Kidding.

521
00:35:51,835 --> 00:35:54,505
She's going to think we're perverts.
Turn it off.

522
00:35:59,677 --> 00:36:01,470
Very handsome hair.

523
00:36:10,104 --> 00:36:12,481
On behalf of Natalee's family,

524
00:36:12,606 --> 00:36:17,653
I want to thank you all for being here today
and participating in the search for her.

525
00:36:18,529 --> 00:36:20,656
For those of you
who have time tomorrow morning,

526
00:36:20,781 --> 00:36:23,242
- I'd like you to be back here at 9:00 a. m.
- Beth. Hi, Jim.

527
00:36:23,367 --> 00:36:24,868
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Hey, sweetie.

528
00:36:24,993 --> 00:36:28,163
I'm glad you're here.
Thank you so much for coming, Carol.

529
00:36:28,706 --> 00:36:31,041
We've covered a lot of terrain.

530
00:36:31,166 --> 00:36:33,210
I know it's been difficult.

531
00:36:33,877 --> 00:36:38,048
Carol, Maggie. This is Diana.
She's been amazing,

532
00:36:38,173 --> 00:36:40,509
helping us with everything.

533
00:36:41,093 --> 00:36:42,511
I hope you two have better luck than me

534
00:36:42,636 --> 00:36:46,056
getting Beth to take a nap
or eat more than two bites.

535
00:36:46,348 --> 00:36:49,351
I just wanted to let you know
that we're going to re-air your statement

536
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:52,521
from this morning again tonight
and tomorrow.

537
00:36:52,646 --> 00:36:57,109
Anything until the police agree
to invite the FBI to help work on the case.

538
00:36:57,234 --> 00:36:58,819
- Thank you.
- Okay.

539
00:37:00,404 --> 00:37:03,407
Maggie, you can start by logging all the calls
we've been getting on the tip lines,

540
00:37:03,532 --> 00:37:06,368
and, Carol, you can help me coordinate
with the churches back home

541
00:37:06,493 --> 00:37:08,662
who are helping raise the reward money.

542
00:37:14,501 --> 00:37:19,256
There have been 23 sightings of Natalee
on the tip line, 23.

543
00:37:20,382 --> 00:37:24,470
She's here on this island somewhere, alive.

544
00:37:28,015 --> 00:37:31,101
<i>Today, the Aruba government</i>
<i>allowed all government employees</i>

545
00:37:31,226 --> 00:37:34,313
<i>to leave work a half-day early</i>
<i>and join in the search for Natalee.</i>

546
00:37:34,438 --> 00:37:35,606
What's today, Friday?

547
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:38,233
Four and a half days
since Natalee disappeared.

548
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:40,444
Yes, we have a medevac plane
sitting at the airport,

549
00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:42,071
ready to bring her home.

550
00:37:42,196 --> 00:37:44,490
The Dutch Marines, they got the sand dunes
with a fine-tooth comb.

551
00:37:44,615 --> 00:37:47,034
And pretty much from the lighthouse
to the hotel's been covered, as well.

552
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:49,745
That's how I knew that the FBI
was on its way down.

553
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,246
I heard it on the news this morning.

554
00:37:51,372 --> 00:37:53,582
CNN gets everything first.

555
00:37:53,707 --> 00:37:57,336
It's crazy how the media
has swooped down on us here.

556
00:37:57,461 --> 00:38:00,506
But if it helps us get our hands on...
Can I call you back?

557
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:04,968
I just found out that Natalee's being held
in a choller house in St Nicolaas,

558
00:38:05,469 --> 00:38:09,723
and they're saying they will release her
if you give them $4,000.

559
00:38:24,196 --> 00:38:25,614
Where is she?

560
00:38:27,408 --> 00:38:29,785
Hey. Who the hell are you?

561
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,044
You brought your camera crew?
Get out of here.

562
00:38:39,169 --> 00:38:41,755
I don't want you here. Make them go away.

563
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,300
I don't want them taking pictures of
my daughter after she's been held hostage,

564
00:38:45,426 --> 00:38:47,344
after who knows what she's been through.

565
00:38:47,469 --> 00:38:50,973
You don't understand.
The story is big. It's huge.

566
00:38:54,935 --> 00:38:56,437
She's not here.

567
00:38:57,146 --> 00:38:59,231
Liars! You lied to us!

568
00:39:03,444 --> 00:39:05,195
I believed them.

569
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,198
- I thought we were about to get her back.
- Come on, guys. Get back from the car.

570
00:39:08,323 --> 00:39:11,368
I thought I was about to hold her.

571
00:39:11,744 --> 00:39:13,829
- Give her a break. Leave her alone.
- Hey, come on. Come on.

572
00:39:13,954 --> 00:39:17,041
- We've got to try to have faith.
- Don't tell me that.

573
00:39:17,624 --> 00:39:19,501
You don't know how much I've prayed.

574
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:26,091
Oh, God. Why don't you answer my prayers?

575
00:39:39,688 --> 00:39:42,691
I'm the one that invited
that guy to the club.

576
00:39:44,777 --> 00:39:48,655
- If it wasn't for me...
- Stop. It's not your fault.

577
00:39:51,158 --> 00:39:53,285
<i>Tonight, as the search grows,</i>

578
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:56,580
<i>two men in custody in connection</i>
<i>with Natalee's disappearance.</i>

579
00:39:56,705 --> 00:40:00,834
<i>These two security guards</i>
<i>worked for the Allegro Hotel.</i>

580
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:03,879
<i>What led police to</i>
<i>these two security guys?</i>

581
00:40:04,004 --> 00:40:07,174
<i>I'm guessing the three guys</i>
<i>that picked her up from the bar.</i>

582
00:40:07,299 --> 00:40:10,552
<i>Today, a mattress was discovered</i>
<i>with blood on it.</i>

583
00:40:11,136 --> 00:40:14,515
Beth! Beth!
Do you think Natalee is still alive?

584
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:19,019
Beth! Beth! We heard you provided
the police with blood samples. Is that true?

585
00:40:19,144 --> 00:40:21,397
Hey, look, she's not gonna talk to you, okay?
Leave her alone.

586
00:40:21,522 --> 00:40:23,649
Do you think the security guards
murdered your daughter?

587
00:40:23,774 --> 00:40:25,484
Get her out of here.

588
00:40:27,945 --> 00:40:29,822
Look, please, just help us, all right?

589
00:40:29,947 --> 00:40:30,948
We would just appreciate it

590
00:40:31,073 --> 00:40:33,826
if you could get out the information
about the reward, all right?

591
00:40:33,951 --> 00:40:35,661
A lot of folks back home
have been pitching in,

592
00:40:35,786 --> 00:40:40,916
and we're offering $100,000
for Natalee's safe return,

593
00:40:42,042 --> 00:40:47,339
and we also have $50,000 for any
information leading up to us finding her.

594
00:40:48,465 --> 00:40:49,800
It's 1:30.

595
00:40:54,138 --> 00:40:55,472
It's 2:00 a. m.

596
00:40:57,474 --> 00:40:58,809
It's 2:30.

597
00:41:02,563 --> 00:41:04,356
- Stop.
- It's not Natalee.

598
00:41:04,481 --> 00:41:07,359
- Rewind. Rewind it.
- Beth, it's not her.

599
00:41:12,072 --> 00:41:13,532
That's Hayley.

600
00:41:16,702 --> 00:41:20,664
Keep going. Keep going.
Maybe they brought her back later.

601
00:41:33,135 --> 00:41:34,428
They lied.

602
00:41:36,013 --> 00:41:38,599
Those boys didn't bring her back here.

603
00:41:39,933 --> 00:41:41,185
They lied.

604
00:41:41,685 --> 00:41:44,188
Just tell me what happened, Joran.

605
00:41:44,313 --> 00:41:46,565
I never should have told Terry anything.

606
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,609
What the hell did he do?

607
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:53,572
He told his parents what I told him.
And they made him go talk to the police.

608
00:41:55,032 --> 00:41:56,950
Here. Let us out here.

609
00:42:06,335 --> 00:42:07,795
Holiday Inn is back there.

610
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,964
I'll walk her on the beach
the rest of the way.

611
00:42:15,052 --> 00:42:18,597
Come on. We're here, we're here. Let's go.

612
00:42:20,224 --> 00:42:21,892
Let's go. Okay.

613
00:42:30,567 --> 00:42:31,735
How are you gonna get home?

614
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,570
I'll walk, whatever.

615
00:42:37,825 --> 00:42:38,992
Watch out. Yeah.

616
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:54,925
We need to talk to Detective Sneijder.

617
00:42:55,551 --> 00:42:58,387
Is this about what the test said,
about the mattress they found?

618
00:42:58,512 --> 00:42:59,555
The results are back?

619
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,890
The blood on that mattress
didn't belong to...

620
00:43:02,016 --> 00:43:03,225
It was dog's blood.

621
00:43:03,434 --> 00:43:06,061
They're going to let the security guards go.

622
00:43:06,437 --> 00:43:08,188
Okay, then we really
need to talk to Sneijder.

623
00:43:08,313 --> 00:43:10,399
Well, he's in a meeting right now,
but if you want to wait...

624
00:43:10,524 --> 00:43:13,861
No, we've done enough waiting.
We'll find him ourselves.

625
00:43:32,463 --> 00:43:34,048
They're friends.

626
00:43:35,215 --> 00:43:39,011
Of course they're friends. That's why
they can haul in two security guards

627
00:43:39,136 --> 00:43:43,098
while the people last seen with Natalee
are free to cover their tracks.

628
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,642
They're protecting his son.

629
00:43:51,706 --> 00:43:54,917
Is there really nothing else
going on in the world?

630
00:43:59,005 --> 00:44:01,924
- Thank you very much.
- Hi, Mr Bekker. How nice of you...

631
00:44:02,049 --> 00:44:05,761
The Prime Minister wants to see you
and your captain in his office.

632
00:44:07,221 --> 00:44:09,265
- In one hour.
- Mr Bekker...

633
00:44:16,481 --> 00:44:17,940
Joran, get up.

634
00:44:18,483 --> 00:44:20,401
Joran van der Sloot, you are under arrest

635
00:44:20,526 --> 00:44:23,946
on charges relating to the disappearance
of Natalee Holloway.

636
00:44:31,579 --> 00:44:35,541
Why are you doing this, Frank?
You know we would have come down.

637
00:44:35,666 --> 00:44:39,170
But this makes us look much more ruthless.
The Prime Minister's complaining.

638
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:44,175
He says our image is suffering.
We're too soft. Complain to him.

639
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:54,352
It's right in there.
Here, honey, put that on.

640
00:44:55,061 --> 00:44:57,438
All right, listen.
You got Blake Hartley first.

641
00:44:57,563 --> 00:45:03,152
CNN's at 3:20. ABC's 3:30.
And Greta's at 3:45.

642
00:45:03,277 --> 00:45:06,114
Hey, sweetie, why don't you
put some lipstick on for the cameras?

643
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:08,825
- I don't care about any damn makeup.
- Mrs Twitty.

644
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:11,119
- Okay.
- Hello.

645
00:45:11,244 --> 00:45:12,954
- Hi.
- This way.

646
00:45:16,249 --> 00:45:18,376
We're ready. Quiet, please.

647
00:45:18,835 --> 00:45:21,963
So how's she doing today?
I've been worried about her,

648
00:45:22,088 --> 00:45:24,006
after the statement
the FBI showed her last night.

649
00:45:24,132 --> 00:45:25,133
We're rolling.

650
00:45:25,258 --> 00:45:28,094
A friend of Joran's told us
the boys lied to the police

651
00:45:28,219 --> 00:45:31,472
because Joran feared punishment
for sneaking out that night.

652
00:45:31,597 --> 00:45:33,641
The friend said,
"What difference does it make

653
00:45:33,766 --> 00:45:37,728
"if we left her at the hotel
or on the beach near the hotel?"

654
00:45:37,854 --> 00:45:39,355
I think it makes a huge difference

655
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,442
if the people who last saw Natalee
are telling lies about it.

656
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:45,528
You don't lie to the police
or to the mother of a missing child

657
00:45:45,653 --> 00:45:49,490
unless you've done something wrong.
In his statement, Joran

658
00:45:52,577 --> 00:45:56,497
describes Natalee's underwear
and other things.

659
00:45:56,622 --> 00:46:00,293
I believe that Joran,
and possibly Deepak and Satish Kalpoe,

660
00:46:00,418 --> 00:46:03,963
slipped Natalee the date-rape drug,
then sexually assaulted her,

661
00:46:04,088 --> 00:46:07,467
then whisked her away
somewhere so she wouldn't talk.

662
00:46:08,134 --> 00:46:11,345
I think I have the right to know
what the police are doing about it.

663
00:46:11,554 --> 00:46:14,974
<i>Earlier today Aruban authorities</i>
<i>arrested three suspects...</i>

664
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:18,186
It seems weird it took them
10 whole days to arrest them.

665
00:46:18,311 --> 00:46:22,064
I know. At home, they would've started
investigating those boys the first night.

666
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:26,319
So they'll have to talk now, right?
Tell everyone where they took Nat,

667
00:46:26,444 --> 00:46:28,863
- so you can bring her home?
- That's the plan.

668
00:46:28,988 --> 00:46:31,282
Do you think she's still okay?

669
00:46:31,532 --> 00:46:35,077
Of course she's okay.
She has to be okay, or...

670
00:46:36,913 --> 00:46:40,124
Honey, I need to know that you're okay, too.

671
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:43,377
How are you getting along?
You getting plenty to eat?

672
00:46:43,628 --> 00:46:47,006
- I kind of don't feel like eating.
<i>- Well, baby, you got to eat.</i>

673
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,968
Those guys are on TV. They look like jerks.

674
00:46:51,594 --> 00:46:53,930
Why would Natalee go anywhere with them?

675
00:46:55,348 --> 00:47:00,436
You're snivelling like an eight-year-old.
Stop being an idiot. Start using your head.

676
00:47:02,647 --> 00:47:04,065
Look at me.

677
00:47:05,066 --> 00:47:09,195
All kinds of people from the DA's office,
the FBI, are gonna be in here.

678
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,864
And they don't know you from nobody.

679
00:47:11,989 --> 00:47:15,284
They don't know what I know,
that you're a loyal kid,

680
00:47:15,785 --> 00:47:19,163
who'd be prepared to lie,
to protect his friends.

681
00:47:19,288 --> 00:47:23,793
But those friends of yours,
are they gonna be so loyal to you?

682
00:47:25,628 --> 00:47:28,089
Ain't gonna happen, Joran.

683
00:47:28,214 --> 00:47:33,344
So if you know what they did to that
little girl, it's time to open your mouth!

684
00:47:47,942 --> 00:47:50,278
This is where we were making out.

685
00:47:50,486 --> 00:47:55,658
- Did you have sex with her?
- No. We were going to, but...

686
00:48:03,541 --> 00:48:06,794
- Do you like me?
- I like you.

687
00:48:08,337 --> 00:48:14,760
I like the beach and the stars
and the world all spinny!

688
00:48:16,179 --> 00:48:17,847
Spinny.

689
00:48:19,182 --> 00:48:22,894
Do you want to do it? Do you?

690
00:48:23,978 --> 00:48:25,396
I don't know.

691
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,652
Do you have any protection?

692
00:48:35,281 --> 00:48:39,494
Sorry. I'm sorry. Don't get all mad.

693
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:44,999
You know I won't.
As long as you don't leave me like this.

694
00:48:49,837 --> 00:48:51,756
You're sure this is the spot
where you last saw her?

695
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:54,050
- Yes, I'm sure.
- So, what was she doing?

696
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:57,845
Natalee, hey. Don't fall asleep.
I have to take you back.

697
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:02,850
Stay with me. It's nice here. It's so nice.

698
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:05,937
I can't. I have school tomorrow.

699
00:49:09,982 --> 00:49:11,317
Natalee.

700
00:49:16,864 --> 00:49:21,869
Deepak, hey. It's me. I'm at the beach.
I need you to come pick me up.

701
00:49:24,247 --> 00:49:26,457
No, no. She's all passed out.

702
00:49:26,582 --> 00:49:30,086
You mustn't tell us that you called Deepak
if you didn't call him,

703
00:49:30,211 --> 00:49:31,712
'cause we can check the cell phone records.

704
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:34,048
- You'll see it's true.
- Then what happened?

705
00:49:44,976 --> 00:49:46,936
- Where's your shoes?
- I left them on the beach.

706
00:49:47,061 --> 00:49:49,313
- So go get them.
- No.

707
00:49:49,439 --> 00:49:52,150
She's gonna wake up and see me
and try to make me stay with her.

708
00:49:52,275 --> 00:49:53,276
Why don't you go get them?

709
00:49:53,401 --> 00:49:56,904
You didn't tell her you were leaving?
You just ditched her?

710
00:49:57,447 --> 00:50:00,783
- Let's go, man.
- Okay, I'll get them later.

711
00:50:00,908 --> 00:50:04,078
So, you're saying that Deepak stopped here
to get your shoes,

712
00:50:04,203 --> 00:50:06,205
and Natalee was still here?

713
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:12,462
He told Terry
that Natalee put her hands down his pants.

714
00:50:13,629 --> 00:50:16,132
Ask Terry.
He showed it to me on his computer.

715
00:50:16,257 --> 00:50:18,426
And what do you think happened?

716
00:50:25,475 --> 00:50:26,976
<i>I think Deepak dropped me off at home,</i>

717
00:50:27,101 --> 00:50:30,313
<i>came back here, found Natalee</i>
<i>and raped her.</i>

718
00:50:32,148 --> 00:50:34,108
Then he killed her. Buried her somewhere.

719
00:50:34,609 --> 00:50:38,404
- It's not what I'm saying.
- So then who is?

720
00:50:39,489 --> 00:50:42,283
- But you promised. I have to know.
- I'll talk to him and see what I can find out.

721
00:50:42,408 --> 00:50:43,659
But when?

722
00:50:58,257 --> 00:50:59,884
You want some gum?

723
00:51:09,852 --> 00:51:15,650
I want an interview. And in exchange,
I'll tell you what Joran is telling the police.

724
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:23,282
Joran! He did it! I didn't.
I never touched her! I never touched her!

725
00:51:23,407 --> 00:51:26,369
Joran's the one! Joran's the one!
He touched her!

726
00:51:26,494 --> 00:51:29,789
I never touched her! I never touched her!

727
00:51:29,914 --> 00:51:34,836
<i>Also tonight, a theory is growing that</i>
<i>18-year-old American girl Natalee Holloway</i>

728
00:51:34,961 --> 00:51:37,338
<i>could be wrapped up in the sex-slave...</i>

729
00:51:37,505 --> 00:51:42,009
This is Joran's statement
from the day after Natalee went missing?

730
00:51:43,469 --> 00:51:47,056
Okay. Okay,
I'd say that we don't wait for the police.

731
00:51:47,181 --> 00:51:49,767
I say that we go out,
and we find these guys,

732
00:51:49,892 --> 00:51:53,688
and we beat them until they
squeal like the pigs that they are.

733
00:51:58,443 --> 00:52:03,072
- If I don't go... I can't lose my job.
- I know.

734
00:52:03,197 --> 00:52:06,325
If I thought they were doing
all they could to find her...

735
00:52:07,076 --> 00:52:08,244
I know.

736
00:52:10,246 --> 00:52:14,208
I'm not coming back.
I'm never coming back here.

737
00:52:39,734 --> 00:52:42,320
Yes, the Prime Minister
has urged the police department

738
00:52:42,445 --> 00:52:45,573
and the District Attorney's office
to share all case documents with the FBI.

739
00:52:45,698 --> 00:52:50,453
Hey, Barbara. You see him?
He's with the Prime Minister's office.

740
00:52:50,578 --> 00:52:52,413
He just told whoever's interviewing him

741
00:52:52,538 --> 00:52:55,082
that he talks to me
at least once a day about the case.

742
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:56,959
I've never even met him.

743
00:52:58,294 --> 00:53:02,924
I just...
I don't know how I'm supposed to do this.

744
00:53:07,553 --> 00:53:09,972
I just talked with the FBI guy.

745
00:53:10,098 --> 00:53:14,769
They're saying the way those boys
are pointing the finger at each other,

746
00:53:15,853 --> 00:53:22,235
they're pretty sure that
Natalee is not alive.

747
00:53:26,823 --> 00:53:32,620
I'm sorry.
I hate that they're making me tell you this.

748
00:53:32,745 --> 00:53:35,373
Well, what about all the sightings of her
on the tip line?

749
00:53:35,498 --> 00:53:40,211
We've also been told that traces of blood
have been found in Deepak Kalpoe's car

750
00:53:40,336 --> 00:53:41,921
and that one of the boys have confessed

751
00:53:42,046 --> 00:53:44,590
and given details
of where Miss Holloway is buried.

752
00:53:44,715 --> 00:53:48,094
Are you ready, Beth?
We're about to go live in 30 seconds.

753
00:53:48,219 --> 00:53:50,638
We're ready. Quiet, please.

754
00:54:01,107 --> 00:54:05,278
Take me to a church, a chapel.
Somewhere I can talk to God.

755
00:54:14,537 --> 00:54:15,872
Pull over here.

756
00:54:28,593 --> 00:54:32,972
Please. Let me have her back.

757
00:54:35,141 --> 00:54:39,228
Give her back to me. She's a good person.

758
00:54:39,353 --> 00:54:42,815
She's gonna be a doctor.
She's gonna help people.

759
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,864
Just tell me what you want.
Tell me what I have to do!

760
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,994
My little girl is with God now.

761
00:55:40,832 --> 00:55:42,750
She's in God's hands.

762
00:55:52,677 --> 00:55:55,596
Joran and Natalee,
they got out of the car here.

763
00:56:01,561 --> 00:56:04,730
- How are you gonna get home?
- I'll walk, whatever.

764
00:56:06,357 --> 00:56:10,445
- What time was that?
- I already made a statement about that.

765
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:11,863
What does that mean?

766
00:56:11,988 --> 00:56:14,490
That you don't remember
what you told us last time?

767
00:56:14,615 --> 00:56:17,410
You keep asking me the same questions.
I'm getting sick of it.

768
00:56:17,535 --> 00:56:18,661
I know what you're trying to do.

769
00:56:18,786 --> 00:56:20,705
The only thing we're trying to do
is find out the truth.

770
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:22,206
I've told you the truth.

771
00:56:22,331 --> 00:56:26,627
But if I say anything a little different,
you'll make it seem as if I am lying,

772
00:56:26,752 --> 00:56:28,171
when I'm not.

773
00:56:28,588 --> 00:56:31,048
You can't make me answer
the same questions.

774
00:56:31,174 --> 00:56:34,927
- It is my right not to answer anything.
- Okay. Okay. All right.

775
00:56:35,052 --> 00:56:38,473
Just tell us what Joran said
when he called you that night.

776
00:56:38,598 --> 00:56:41,434
Hello? Hey. What are you doing?

777
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:43,227
<i>What do you think I'm doing?</i>
<i>I'm walking home.</i>

778
00:56:43,352 --> 00:56:47,106
Well, you could have got a ride from me,
but, no, you had to get laid.

779
00:56:47,565 --> 00:56:50,818
We didn't do it.
She gave me a happy ending, though.

780
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:52,403
<i>So, did you take her to her hotel?</i>

781
00:56:52,528 --> 00:56:54,989
No, I left her at the beach.
She's totally passed out.

782
00:56:55,448 --> 00:56:58,451
You left her on the beach?
What kind of ass are you?

783
00:56:58,951 --> 00:57:02,205
Shut up, man. She has to go home
in the morning. Her friends will find her.

784
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:04,499
Still, man, that's cold.

785
00:57:04,624 --> 00:57:08,878
<i>Deepak, I can't hear you.</i>
<i>I'll talk to you online when I get home.</i>

786
00:57:09,003 --> 00:57:10,296
Yeah, okay.

787
00:57:20,556 --> 00:57:24,644
You know what this is?
The logs from Deepak's computer.

788
00:57:24,977 --> 00:57:27,438
He was on the Internet the entire time,

789
00:57:27,563 --> 00:57:30,441
the whole time that you said
he was giving you a ride home.

790
00:57:30,566 --> 00:57:32,026
I never said that Deepak picked me up.

791
00:57:32,151 --> 00:57:35,571
I called Deepak,
but it was Satish who came to get me.

792
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,627
- Where's your shoes?
- I left them on the beach.

793
00:57:49,752 --> 00:57:51,629
- So go get them.
- No.

794
00:57:51,754 --> 00:57:53,798
She's gonna wake up and see me
and try and make me stay with her.

795
00:57:53,923 --> 00:57:56,134
- Why don't you go get them?
- You didn't tell her you were leaving?

796
00:57:56,259 --> 00:57:59,804
- You just ditched her?
- Let's go, man.

797
00:58:00,221 --> 00:58:02,807
I never meant that it was Deepak.
Satish is the one that showed up!

798
00:58:02,932 --> 00:58:05,184
Now no one's gonna believe him.

799
00:58:06,769 --> 00:58:10,189
<i>Let's just take a look</i>
<i>at some of the issues that have come up</i>

800
00:58:10,314 --> 00:58:12,984
<i>during the Natalee Holloway search.</i>

801
00:58:13,109 --> 00:58:16,654
<i>First of all, we heard</i>
<i>that blood had been found in the car.</i>

802
00:58:16,779 --> 00:58:20,783
<i>Then we found blood on a mattress.</i>
<i>It was dog's blood.</i>

803
00:58:21,033 --> 00:58:23,619
I know, I know, it's crazy.

804
00:58:23,744 --> 00:58:25,413
The police department
is run by the Arubans,

805
00:58:25,538 --> 00:58:29,625
but the government is run by the Dutch,
and they just... They don't cooperate.

806
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:33,838
Well, did Joran say he knew
where Natalee was buried or not?

807
00:58:33,963 --> 00:58:37,175
Did the FBI show you any statements?

808
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,010
Did you ask them
if they had seen any statements?

809
00:58:39,135 --> 00:58:40,595
- I doubt it.
- Well, why not?

810
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,096
They're working on the case, right?

811
00:58:42,221 --> 00:58:44,056
Yeah, well,
from what the FBI guy was saying,

812
00:58:44,182 --> 00:58:47,852
the police never really let the FBI in
on the investigation.

813
00:58:47,977 --> 00:58:49,395
Which is kind of what I expected,

814
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:54,734
but I thought, with all the media attention,
things would be more different.

815
00:58:56,903 --> 00:59:00,698
At least the Venezuelan government
is cooperating with them.

816
00:59:01,157 --> 00:59:02,742
With who? The FBI?

817
00:59:02,867 --> 00:59:06,120
Yeah, they're checking all the calls
on the tip line about,

818
00:59:06,245 --> 00:59:09,248
you know, the sex-slave thing.

819
00:59:09,791 --> 00:59:12,293
Well, you said I should ignore those calls.

820
00:59:12,418 --> 00:59:15,171
You should, but the FBI,
they've got to rule it out.

821
00:59:15,296 --> 00:59:18,007
Great. So now I get to sit here
and wonder what's worse,

822
00:59:18,132 --> 00:59:22,303
my daughter murdered
or a sex slave in Venezuela.

823
00:59:23,179 --> 00:59:27,558
Those three bastards.
They could end this torture.

824
00:59:28,142 --> 00:59:31,020
But they don't care.
They just don't give a damn.

825
00:59:33,981 --> 00:59:37,318
What's taking so long?
Why don't they let us out of here?

826
00:59:37,443 --> 00:59:40,905
I should hit you,
both of you lying pieces of crap.

827
00:59:41,322 --> 00:59:43,741
Who's the liar? Not us.

828
00:59:43,866 --> 00:59:47,703
You know what happened with that girl.
If you don't know it, then nothing happened.

829
00:59:47,829 --> 00:59:50,331
You're the one that has to tell the truth.

830
00:59:50,456 --> 00:59:52,583
I'm going to laugh
when they find that girl alive.

831
00:59:52,708 --> 00:59:55,795
- I hope they do find her.
- No, you don't. You're afraid of it,

832
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,506
because if you did something bad to her,
then everyone will know.

833
00:59:58,631 --> 01:00:02,385
- We are not afraid. You should be.
- I didn't do anything! I left her asleep!

834
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:05,638
I told you that night, Deepak!
You gonna deny it?

835
01:00:19,318 --> 01:00:22,447
The judge just signed
the order for your release.

836
01:00:23,573 --> 01:00:26,159
Your mother is here to take you home.

837
01:00:29,036 --> 01:00:30,621
Not you, Joran.

838
01:00:37,462 --> 01:00:40,089
Two suspects were released yesterday

839
01:00:40,214 --> 01:00:43,843
who were involved in a violent crime
against my daughter.

840
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:47,597
I am asking all nations to hear my plea.

841
01:00:48,431 --> 01:00:54,312
Do not allow the Kalpoe brothers to
enter your country until this case is solved.

842
01:00:55,354 --> 01:01:00,109
Do not allow these criminals
to walk among your citizens.

843
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:04,238
Do not allow them
to get away with this crime,

844
01:01:04,572 --> 01:01:08,951
in the name of my beautiful, intelligent,

845
01:01:10,369 --> 01:01:15,333
outstanding daughter,
whom I have not seen in 36 days

846
01:01:15,833 --> 01:01:20,505
and for whom I will continue to search
until I find her.

847
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:23,674
Thank you.

848
01:01:24,133 --> 01:01:28,012
I really wish you hadn't done that, called
the Kalpoes criminals. It's just not good.

849
01:01:28,137 --> 01:01:30,973
Not good?
You're the one who said there's a transcript

850
01:01:31,099 --> 01:01:34,435
of Deepak saying he had sexual contact
with Natalee.

851
01:01:34,644 --> 01:01:36,938
- I think that makes him a criminal.
- I'm not saying he's not.

852
01:01:37,063 --> 01:01:39,816
I'm just saying that the locals are gonna
not like it.

853
01:01:39,941 --> 01:01:42,944
I think the locals will understand
that it's the Kalpoes

854
01:01:43,069 --> 01:01:45,196
and Joran who are causing all this trouble.

855
01:01:45,321 --> 01:01:48,241
Excuse me, but you've been here,
what, five weeks? They're from here.

856
01:01:48,366 --> 01:01:50,743
Aren't you supposed to be on our side?

857
01:01:51,786 --> 01:01:53,704
Okay, this is the problem.

858
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:57,208
You think there's sides, and there's not.
It's just a big mess.

859
01:01:57,333 --> 01:01:59,544
You think they should do things here
the way they do things at home,

860
01:01:59,669 --> 01:02:02,713
- but they don't. It's not the same.
- That much, we've figured out.

861
01:02:02,839 --> 01:02:05,258
So why are you going on TV
every two minutes

862
01:02:05,383 --> 01:02:07,260
telling everyone
how screwed up the island is?

863
01:02:07,385 --> 01:02:09,720
I never say bad things about Aruba.

864
01:02:09,846 --> 01:02:12,723
And I do those interviews
because the media is all I've got.

865
01:02:12,849 --> 01:02:16,394
- They're the only ones who seem to care.
- You think I don't care?

866
01:02:23,734 --> 01:02:26,154
I am the one that's been defending Natalee.

867
01:02:26,279 --> 01:02:27,447
When the media were spreading rumours

868
01:02:27,572 --> 01:02:29,824
about her being drunk
the whole time she was here,

869
01:02:29,949 --> 01:02:34,162
or buying crack, I defended her.
And this is the thanks I get?

870
01:02:36,622 --> 01:02:38,416
- You want us to thank you?
- Jug.

871
01:02:38,541 --> 01:02:43,379
- As useless as you've been?
- Stop. It won't help anything. Stop.

872
01:02:44,338 --> 01:02:46,924
My husband,
he helped look for the missing girl.

873
01:02:47,049 --> 01:02:50,636
- And you? Did you help in the search?
- No, no. I have a friend, she works here.

874
01:02:50,762 --> 01:02:54,015
She said she saw Natalee
a bunch of times with a Dutch boy.

875
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:57,477
I don't understand these people.
Don't they have children of their own?

876
01:03:01,898 --> 01:03:04,108
My friend thinks they ran away together.

877
01:03:04,233 --> 01:03:09,071
She heard the mother was very strict,
and Natalee didn't want to go home.

878
01:03:09,655 --> 01:03:13,659
Go home! Go home! Go home! Go home!

879
01:03:13,785 --> 01:03:16,621
Go home! Go home! Go home!

880
01:03:55,868 --> 01:03:56,869
Thank you.

881
01:03:57,203 --> 01:04:00,289
I have a photo
I'd like to have copied, please.

882
01:04:05,461 --> 01:04:08,172
- Do you want a colour copy?
- Yes, I do.

883
01:04:09,257 --> 01:04:12,343
It's a picture I took of Natalee
on her graduation day.

884
01:04:12,677 --> 01:04:15,513
It's an amazing thing
to watch your child graduate.

885
01:04:15,638 --> 01:04:18,015
You think about how you rocked them
as a baby,

886
01:04:18,141 --> 01:04:22,812
how you helped her learn to walk,
to read, to ride her bike.

887
01:04:23,354 --> 01:04:27,483
You think about how you spent
every waking hour of the last 18 years

888
01:04:27,608 --> 01:04:31,821
making sure that she was safe and loved
and taken care of.

889
01:04:31,946 --> 01:04:35,658
And then there she is, beautiful and happy,

890
01:04:36,325 --> 01:04:38,744
with an amazing life ahead of her.

891
01:04:40,746 --> 01:04:43,541
Did you try to help Natalee, Deepak?

892
01:04:43,666 --> 01:04:47,462
Or did you just sit there and watch
while she fought for her life?

893
01:04:47,587 --> 01:04:50,506
No, I don't think you just watched.

894
01:04:50,631 --> 01:04:55,470
You said she put her hands in your pants.
I'll bet you anything she said no.

895
01:04:55,595 --> 01:04:57,889
And you didn't like that, did you?

896
01:04:58,431 --> 01:05:01,184
Did you have to hold her down
while Joran raped her?

897
01:05:01,309 --> 01:05:03,352
Or was she already unconscious?

898
01:05:05,146 --> 01:05:10,193
This is a prayer bracelet,
made by Natalee's friends back home,

899
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:14,197
friends who miss her desperately, like I do.

900
01:05:15,156 --> 01:05:20,536
I have a lot more photos, and I'll be here
every day until you do the right thing

901
01:05:20,661 --> 01:05:23,414
and tell me what happened to my daughter.

902
01:05:49,148 --> 01:05:50,900
- Hey.
- Hey.

903
01:05:51,651 --> 01:05:55,905
You should see this letter from
Deepak's attorney, saying I harassed him,

904
01:05:56,030 --> 01:05:59,992
and that they'll press charges
if I ever dare to talk to him again.

905
01:06:01,953 --> 01:06:06,541
What? What is it?

906
01:06:07,625 --> 01:06:11,045
The judge said there's not enough evidence
to hold him.

907
01:06:12,505 --> 01:06:15,258
- Joran.
- Does this mean you are innocent?

908
01:06:15,383 --> 01:06:18,428
Is it true you're moving back to Holland?

909
01:06:18,553 --> 01:06:20,430
Are you leaving Aruba?

910
01:06:29,897 --> 01:06:34,944
That's it. It's time to lay down our swords
and go home.

911
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:40,074
It doesn't matter what we do,
they just keep covering up the truth.

912
01:06:40,491 --> 01:06:44,287
Like it's none of my damn business
what happened to my own child!

913
01:07:00,887 --> 01:07:03,806
I don't know if I can leave without Natalee.

914
01:07:06,267 --> 01:07:08,019
I don't think I can.

915
01:07:27,038 --> 01:07:29,081
Thanks for letting us talk with Joran.

916
01:07:29,207 --> 01:07:31,667
I understand
the whole family's moving to Amsterdam.

917
01:07:31,793 --> 01:07:36,881
Yes. And people need to know that
Joran is a normal kid, like everyone else.

918
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:39,842
He will start college
in a few weeks in Holland.

919
01:07:39,967 --> 01:07:42,678
He's going to study the law, like I did.

920
01:07:43,387 --> 01:07:46,682
Great. Okay, before we turn the cameras on,

921
01:07:46,808 --> 01:07:49,060
we should go over
what we'll be talking about.

922
01:07:49,185 --> 01:07:52,063
Joran, I'll be asking you about
how you met Natalee and what happened

923
01:07:52,188 --> 01:07:55,441
once you two were dropped off at the beach.
Are you willing to talk about that?

924
01:07:55,566 --> 01:07:57,068
I'll tell you everything that happened there.

925
01:08:00,196 --> 01:08:04,784
I wish I'd met you earlier,
like the first day.

926
01:08:04,909 --> 01:08:08,704
- Yeah, we could've had a lot of fun.
- I had fun tonight!

927
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:15,711
You're the first guy I've ever kissed
that made my heart beat like crazy.

928
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:25,555
I should be getting home. Walk you back?

929
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:30,393
No, I don't want to go back yet.
It's my last night. Stay out here with me.

930
01:08:30,518 --> 01:08:35,481
I can't. I have to go to school tomorrow,
and I don't want to leave you here alone.

931
01:08:35,857 --> 01:08:40,319
- Let's just look at the stars.
- Fine.

932
01:08:43,531 --> 01:08:47,452
- I'll carry you back.
- Put me down! Put me down!

933
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,914
<i>- And did you stay with her?</i>
<i>- For a little while.</i>

934
01:08:52,039 --> 01:08:54,917
<i>We were lying on our backs,</i>
<i>looking at the stars, and then she fell asleep.</i>

935
01:08:55,042 --> 01:08:58,254
<i>So I called my friend Deepak</i>
<i>and told him to come pick me up.</i>

936
01:08:58,379 --> 01:08:59,881
<i>- And did he come?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

937
01:09:00,006 --> 01:09:02,592
<i>Well, I mean, I thought it would be Deepak,</i>

938
01:09:02,717 --> 01:09:04,927
<i>but when I got to the car,</i>
<i>it was Satish who was driving.</i>

939
01:09:05,052 --> 01:09:09,098
<i>So you just left Natalee there,</i>
<i>sleeping on the beach, alone?</i>

940
01:09:09,223 --> 01:09:10,683
<i>I didn't plan it,</i>

941
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:16,564
<i>but when I got to the car, Satish said,</i>
<i>"Let's go," so I just got in the car.</i>

942
01:09:16,689 --> 01:09:20,777
<i>I didn't go back and tell her I was leaving,</i>
<i>and that's not very nice,</i>

943
01:09:21,486 --> 01:09:23,154
<i>but it's the one thing I regret.</i>

944
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,698
<i>You've told several different stories</i>
<i>about what happened that night.</i>

945
01:09:25,823 --> 01:09:28,284
<i>- Why should anyone believe you now?</i>
<i>- I don't expect anyone to believe me.</i>

946
01:09:28,409 --> 01:09:31,537
<i>I wouldn't believe me, either,</i>
<i>but it's the truth.</i>

947
01:09:31,662 --> 01:09:32,830
<i>The investigation into the disappearance...</i>

948
01:09:32,955 --> 01:09:35,208
- That's it.
<i>...of Natalee Holloway is ongoing...</i>

949
01:09:35,333 --> 01:09:39,378
I'm gonna get a lawyer, and I'm gonna file
a wrongful-death suit against him.

950
01:09:39,504 --> 01:09:41,255
- Beth.
- Joran is going to college,

951
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:43,091
and where's Natalee?

952
01:09:43,549 --> 01:09:45,593
Somebody has to make him pay.

953
01:09:45,718 --> 01:09:49,639
And if an Aruban judge won't do it,
then maybe an American judge will.

954
01:09:50,139 --> 01:09:51,933
Slow down a minute.

955
01:09:54,143 --> 01:09:57,021
You know what Joran's lawyers
are gonna say.

956
01:09:57,730 --> 01:10:00,274
They're gonna say maybe Deepak went
back to the beach and found her,

957
01:10:00,399 --> 01:10:01,943
- or Satish.
- That's not what happened.

958
01:10:02,068 --> 01:10:04,612
Or maybe the boys tried to blame each other
'cause none of them are guilty.

959
01:10:04,737 --> 01:10:06,614
And someone else came along
and found her and carried her off.

960
01:10:06,739 --> 01:10:09,367
- That's not what happened!
- Or maybe she woke up on her own,

961
01:10:09,492 --> 01:10:11,160
and she decided to go for a swim
and drowned.

962
01:10:11,285 --> 01:10:13,037
- That's not what happened.
- How do you know?

963
01:10:13,162 --> 01:10:16,958
I don't! Okay? I don't know what happened!

964
01:10:17,083 --> 01:10:20,294
But I think that maybe
if I could just hold onto Joran

965
01:10:20,419 --> 01:10:23,172
and squeeze him hard enough,
maybe the truth will come out.

966
01:10:23,297 --> 01:10:25,883
A lawsuit's not gonna be much of a squeeze
if a judge dismisses it.

967
01:10:26,008 --> 01:10:28,678
In the meantime, you're just
keeping yourself here in this misery.

968
01:10:28,803 --> 01:10:31,848
This isn't about me! This is about Natalee.

969
01:10:31,973 --> 01:10:35,518
- And she is worth the effort.
- I'm not talking about Natalee's worth here.

970
01:10:35,643 --> 01:10:39,480
I don't want you talking about it at all.
This is my decision.

971
01:11:04,505 --> 01:11:06,299
Hello, murderer.

972
01:11:27,987 --> 01:11:30,198
Do you have something to say to me?

973
01:11:32,867 --> 01:11:35,787
If you're looking for a job, girl killer.

974
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:38,831
You said you couldn't go back to work

975
01:11:38,956 --> 01:11:40,750
because you couldn't be in a classroom
with a bunch of kids.

976
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:42,418
Now you're flying off
to be with a bunch of kids!

977
01:11:42,543 --> 01:11:44,253
This is important.

978
01:11:44,712 --> 01:11:48,216
If I can stop one kid
from ending up like Natalee, just one...

979
01:11:48,341 --> 01:11:50,384
Natalee will still be gone.

980
01:11:51,135 --> 01:11:56,057
What? I'm not supposed to say it?
She's gone. But we're still here.

981
01:11:57,016 --> 01:12:00,061
What? You want me to move on. Is that it?

982
01:12:00,186 --> 01:12:02,605
Because you're ready to move on? I can't.

983
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:04,482
I don't know what happened to my daughter.

984
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:07,151
And when I try to find out,
you try to talk me out of it.

985
01:12:07,276 --> 01:12:11,447
- That is not true.
- You have no idea what it feels like

986
01:12:11,572 --> 01:12:16,994
to have this horrible
fear trapped right here,

987
01:12:17,829 --> 01:12:22,125
a fear that she's suffered
even worse than I've imagined.

988
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:25,503
I can't move on
until I find out what happened.

989
01:12:25,628 --> 01:12:29,298
Maybe if she were your daughter,
you could understand that!

990
01:12:33,428 --> 01:12:37,014
- I miss her, too.
- I'm sorry.

991
01:12:41,144 --> 01:12:46,357
I know that doesn't sound very nice,
but it's how I feel.

992
01:12:55,491 --> 01:12:58,911
- Mom? Are you okay?
- Yeah.

993
01:13:03,291 --> 01:13:06,752
So, how was it?
Your first day of 11th grade.

994
01:13:07,795 --> 01:13:09,505
People stared at me.

995
01:13:16,012 --> 01:13:18,514
What are we waiting for?
Aren't we gonna go pick up the drugs?

996
01:13:18,639 --> 01:13:20,433
I think you should stay here.

997
01:13:20,558 --> 01:13:24,729
Your face has been all over the TV.
They're gonna recognise you, the girl killer.

998
01:13:24,854 --> 01:13:27,023
Screw you, man. Stop calling me that.

999
01:13:30,943 --> 01:13:32,111
You want me to tell you
what happened to her?

1000
01:13:32,236 --> 01:13:35,156
Hell, no. I don't want to hear about that.

1001
01:13:35,281 --> 01:13:37,700
Drug dealers are paranoid.
I don't want you setting them off.

1002
01:13:37,825 --> 01:13:39,035
You stay in the car.

1003
01:13:46,125 --> 01:13:49,670
- We're good.
- Watch your back.

1004
01:13:50,463 --> 01:13:51,589
Easy.

1005
01:13:56,969 --> 01:14:01,724
- This was in the box of bathroom stuff.
- Lord, I don't know how that got in there.

1006
01:14:01,849 --> 01:14:06,604
Not that this is a bad house or anything,
but I don't get why you're divorcing.

1007
01:14:07,021 --> 01:14:11,651
- You guys still love each other?
- Yes, we do, honey.

1008
01:14:12,443 --> 01:14:16,739
- That's why we're doing this, for each other.
- I just...

1009
01:14:16,864 --> 01:14:22,245
I don't think Natalee would have wanted
this to happen. She'd be really upset.

1010
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:26,624
Well, then, she shouldn't have got
in the car with Joran van der Sloot.

1011
01:14:27,959 --> 01:14:33,214
Matt, I'm sorry. I... Oh, Lord.

1012
01:14:34,507 --> 01:14:36,175
I didn't mean that.

1013
01:14:49,230 --> 01:14:51,816
What is it? What happened?

1014
01:14:54,068 --> 01:14:55,945
I did something stupid.

1015
01:14:56,821 --> 01:14:58,322
<i>Good dope, huh?</i>

1016
01:14:59,031 --> 01:15:03,161
<i>We get a kilo of that and move it,</i>
<i>I'm telling you, we'll make a load of cash.</i>

1017
01:15:03,286 --> 01:15:04,537
<i>Yeah.</i>

1018
01:15:05,163 --> 01:15:07,915
<i>All right, listen,</i>
<i>if we're gonna go into business together,</i>

1019
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,792
<i>I have to know if I can trust you.</i>

1020
01:15:09,917 --> 01:15:13,588
<i>You know you can trust me.</i>
<i>You know you can.</i>

1021
01:15:13,713 --> 01:15:16,799
<i>If I gotta trust you,</i>
<i>then you got to trust me.</i>

1022
01:15:17,508 --> 01:15:19,844
<i>You got to tell me everything that</i>
<i>happened with that girl in Aruba,</i>

1023
01:15:19,969 --> 01:15:24,098
<i>so I can be sure it's not gonna come back</i>
<i>and, you know, bite me in the ass.</i>

1024
01:15:24,223 --> 01:15:26,184
<i>So what the hell happened?</i>

1025
01:15:33,941 --> 01:15:36,652
- This is Beth.
- This is Peter de Vries.

1026
01:15:36,778 --> 01:15:40,823
I'm a crime reporter in Holland. I know
it's early there. I hope I didn't wake you.

1027
01:15:40,948 --> 01:15:42,742
No, no, no. I'm up.

1028
01:15:42,867 --> 01:15:46,621
I've been investigating Joran van der Sloot
for quite a few months now,

1029
01:15:46,746 --> 01:15:51,709
and I think you're going to want to get on
a plane for Holland as soon as possible.

1030
01:15:54,629 --> 01:15:59,592
So, you're saying Joran didn't know
that he was being taped by his friend?

1031
01:16:00,468 --> 01:16:02,929
I'm no friend of that piece of crap.
I can promise you that.

1032
01:16:03,054 --> 01:16:05,598
Patrick only pretended to be Joran's friend,

1033
01:16:05,723 --> 01:16:10,228
and they drove around in an SUV
that we provided to him, full of cameras.

1034
01:16:11,729 --> 01:16:16,901
If you're ready now to watch the footage,
but it's going to be very difficult for you.

1035
01:16:17,026 --> 01:16:18,111
Okay.

1036
01:16:18,903 --> 01:16:22,281
- All right. Stand by, everybody.
- Quiet, please.

1037
01:16:23,866 --> 01:16:26,994
We're on in five, four, three...

1038
01:16:28,746 --> 01:16:30,581
<i>You know what it's like there, Patrick.</i>

1039
01:16:30,706 --> 01:16:33,793
<i>These girls, man, they come down from</i>
<i>the States when they're done with school.</i>

1040
01:16:33,918 --> 01:16:36,462
<i>They're ready to cut loose, man,</i>
<i>ready to party.</i>

1041
01:16:36,587 --> 01:16:41,300
<i>So, this girl, Natalee?</i>

1042
01:16:42,385 --> 01:16:44,804
<i>She was just this girl</i>
<i>hanging out with her friends.</i>

1043
01:16:44,929 --> 01:16:47,140
<i>I wasn't really into her that much,</i>
<i>but she wanted a drink,</i>

1044
01:16:47,265 --> 01:16:48,433
<i>and I'm like, "Why not?" You know?</i>

1045
01:16:48,558 --> 01:16:51,644
<i>Then the place closed,</i>
<i>and she asked me for a ride.</i>

1046
01:16:51,769 --> 01:16:56,357
<i>- So you gave her a ride.</i>
<i>- It was the gentleman thing to do.</i>

1047
01:16:58,693 --> 01:17:01,446
<i>All right, listen,</i>
<i>if we're gonna go into business together,</i>

1048
01:17:01,571 --> 01:17:03,322
<i>I have to know if I can trust you.</i>

1049
01:17:03,448 --> 01:17:05,783
<i>You know you can trust me.</i>
<i>You know you can.</i>

1050
01:17:05,908 --> 01:17:08,161
<i>If I gotta trust you,</i>
<i>then you got to trust me.</i>

1051
01:17:08,286 --> 01:17:10,496
<i>You got to tell me everything that happened</i>
<i>with that girl in Aruba,</i>

1052
01:17:10,621 --> 01:17:14,250
<i>so I can be sure it's not gonna come back</i>
<i>and, you know, bite me in the ass.</i>

1053
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:17,253
<i>- Fine, I'll tell you.</i>
<i>- So what the hell happened?</i>

1054
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:21,340
<i>- Morta. She's dead, isn't she?</i>
<i>- You think I killed her?</i>

1055
01:17:26,929 --> 01:17:29,390
- Do you like me?
- Yes.

1056
01:17:29,515 --> 01:17:32,518
- Do it on the beach?
- Wait.

1057
01:17:34,312 --> 01:17:38,316
- No.
- I'm really turned on. Do you want to do it?

1058
01:17:43,196 --> 01:17:44,697
What the hell?

1059
01:17:45,823 --> 01:17:50,536
<i>I swear to God, Patrick, it was like</i>
<i>in a movie, all the things she was doing.</i>

1060
01:17:51,746 --> 01:17:53,206
<i>- What, shaking?</i>
<i>- A lot, man.</i>

1061
01:17:53,331 --> 01:17:56,876
<i>- So I'm like, "What the hell? What is this?"</i>
<i>- How long was she shaking for?</i>

1062
01:17:57,001 --> 01:17:59,879
<i>Do you even know what it is?</i>
<i>Is it an epileptic attack or something?</i>

1063
01:18:05,593 --> 01:18:11,390
Natalee? Are you all right? Natalee?

1064
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:14,102
<i>So, I'm talking to her, I'm talking to her.</i>

1065
01:18:14,227 --> 01:18:16,729
<i>She says nothing, she says nothing.</i>

1066
01:18:17,230 --> 01:18:20,108
<i>And she's not ticking any more.</i>
<i>I'm panicking, you know?</i>

1067
01:18:20,233 --> 01:18:23,277
<i>- Yeah, of course you were.</i>
<i>- I was almost ready to cry.</i>

1068
01:18:23,402 --> 01:18:28,407
<i>It's like, "Why does this stuff</i>
<i>have to happen to me?" So I grab her arms.</i>

1069
01:18:53,391 --> 01:18:56,644
<i>Hey, it's Joran. Can you meet me?</i>

1070
01:18:59,272 --> 01:19:02,316
Something's happened,
something really bad.

1071
01:19:04,068 --> 01:19:05,445
<i>Then what?</i>

1072
01:19:11,784 --> 01:19:15,246
<i>We're looking down at her,</i>
<i>and she looks sweet, you know?</i>

1073
01:19:15,872 --> 01:19:18,249
<i>What, she's just lying still?</i>

1074
01:19:18,374 --> 01:19:23,129
<i>Still, still. She's not doing anything,</i>
<i>and my friend is like, "Yeah, she's dead."</i>

1075
01:19:24,964 --> 01:19:27,592
<i>- So, who was this guy?</i>
<i>- A friend.</i>

1076
01:19:27,717 --> 01:19:30,928
<i>I'm not gonna tell you his name, because</i>
<i>all this time, he's never talked about it.</i>

1077
01:19:31,053 --> 01:19:33,598
<i>And I'm not gonna talk about it.</i>

1078
01:19:33,723 --> 01:19:36,517
<i>It wasn't my father or anything,</i>
<i>but a really good friend.</i>

1079
01:20:18,392 --> 01:20:22,146
He told me to go to school
and act like nothing happened.

1080
01:20:22,271 --> 01:20:24,023
So it was your father, wasn't it?

1081
01:20:24,148 --> 01:20:26,901
Only your father would care whether
you made it to school the next day or not.

1082
01:20:27,026 --> 01:20:31,030
- I'm telling you, man, it wasn't my father.
- So how far out did he take her?

1083
01:20:31,155 --> 01:20:35,034
Not even 2 kilometres, he said.
But the ocean is big, you know.

1084
01:20:35,159 --> 01:20:38,496
Yeah, the sea is big, man.
Did he weigh her down with anything?

1085
01:20:38,621 --> 01:20:42,667
No. That's why I'm lucky
she was never found.

1086
01:20:42,792 --> 01:20:46,045
If she turned up, I'd be in big trouble.

1087
01:20:46,671 --> 01:20:49,382
What about Deepak and Satish?
Do they know all this?

1088
01:20:49,507 --> 01:20:52,135
No, they didn't know anything, man.
They're stupid.

1089
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:53,469
They didn't even argue when I said

1090
01:20:53,594 --> 01:20:56,055
we should lie about dropping her off
at the hotel.

1091
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:59,058
It was the smartest thing I did.
It confused everybody.

1092
01:20:59,183 --> 01:21:03,896
- No one could figure anything out.
- Yeah, you sure played it smart, all right.

1093
01:21:04,272 --> 01:21:05,940
The only thing I didn't expect

1094
01:21:06,065 --> 01:21:09,235
was that her bitch of a mother
would be such a pain in the ass.

1095
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,571
<i>She turned the whole thing into a circus.</i>

1096
01:21:11,696 --> 01:21:15,283
<i>What I want to know is,</i>
<i>how can you be so sure the girl was dead?</i>

1097
01:21:15,408 --> 01:21:18,244
<i>- People go into comas.</i>
<i>- I wasn't sure about that.</i>

1098
01:21:18,369 --> 01:21:22,415
<i>- Did you check for a pulse?</i>
<i>- No. But it didn't look good.</i>

1099
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:25,126
<i>So it's possible that she was still alive?</i>

1100
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,594
<i>I guess it's possible.</i>

1101
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:37,263
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1102
01:21:37,889 --> 01:21:40,558
She could have been alive
when he threw her over!

1103
01:21:40,683 --> 01:21:43,978
That son of a bitch.
She could have been alive!

1104
01:22:02,663 --> 01:22:06,417
You got it all. You got every bit of it.

1105
01:22:06,542 --> 01:22:09,879
I don't think so.
I don't think he told us everything.

1106
01:22:10,004 --> 01:22:13,591
There's got to be a reason why he decided
to make Natalee disappear,

1107
01:22:13,716 --> 01:22:19,889
instead of calling for help.
Either he raped her or...

1108
01:22:20,681 --> 01:22:22,308
Or he drugged her.

1109
01:22:23,059 --> 01:22:25,853
Which would explain a seizure
in an otherwise healthy girl.

1110
01:22:25,978 --> 01:22:30,650
You should know that when I finally
told him that I was taking him for a ride,

1111
01:22:30,775 --> 01:22:34,779
he said he made it all up,
that he was trying to impress me.

1112
01:22:34,904 --> 01:22:38,991
No. I think, for once in his life,
Joran finally told the truth.

1113
01:22:40,368 --> 01:22:44,247
It's over. This is the end.

1114
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:52,296
This is what I prayed for. To know.

1115
01:22:56,676 --> 01:22:58,511
I just needed to know.

1116
01:22:59,971 --> 01:23:03,224
Do you remember how Lieutenant Sneijder
asked us on the second day

1117
01:23:03,349 --> 01:23:06,519
- if Natalee had a history of seizures?
- Yeah. Yeah. I remember.

1118
01:23:06,644 --> 01:23:09,021
I bet you anything
he already knew what happened.

1119
01:23:09,147 --> 01:23:11,399
<i>You got to tell me everything that happened</i>
<i>with that girl in Aruba,</i>

1120
01:23:11,524 --> 01:23:14,235
<i>so I can be sure it's not gonna come back</i>
<i>and, you know, bite me in the ass.</i>

1121
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:19,365
<i>I'll bet you Joran or his father told Sneijder</i>
<i>that first day, and he kept it a secret,</i>

1122
01:23:19,490 --> 01:23:23,411
<i>letting as much suspicion as possible</i>
<i>land on Deepak and Satish.</i>

1123
01:23:23,536 --> 01:23:25,955
<i>Deepak and Satish?</i>
<i>Do they know all this?</i>

1124
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,040
<i>They're stupid, man.</i>
<i>They didn't know anything.</i>

1125
01:23:28,166 --> 01:23:29,292
<i>They didn't even argue when I said</i>

1126
01:23:29,417 --> 01:23:30,918
<i>we should lie about dropping her off</i>
<i>at the hotel.</i>

1127
01:23:31,502 --> 01:23:32,754
Well, I wouldn't put it past him.

1128
01:23:35,673 --> 01:23:39,510
<i>- Did you tell Matt yet?</i>
<i>- I just called him a minute ago.</i>

1129
01:23:39,761 --> 01:23:43,556
<i>He said, "Mom, I can already hear</i>
<i>the peace in your voice."</i>

1130
01:23:43,681 --> 01:23:46,851
<i>You finally got your answers, Beth.</i>
<i>I'm happy for you.</i>

1131
01:23:46,976 --> 01:23:49,979
<i>I can't let all that loss be for nothing.</i>

1132
01:23:51,856 --> 01:23:54,692
This is Natalee on her graduation day.

1133
01:23:54,817 --> 01:23:59,280
She was so excited, I could barely get her
to stand still for this picture.

1134
01:23:59,781 --> 01:24:03,951
You can see she's wearing the cords
she earned for the National Honour Society,

1135
01:24:04,076 --> 01:24:07,538
the Math Honour Society,
and the Spanish Honour Society.

1136
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:11,417
She was so together, so smart.

1137
01:24:14,128 --> 01:24:16,756
This was her last night in Aruba.

1138
01:24:16,881 --> 01:24:20,176
She was there with over 100 classmates.

1139
01:24:20,301 --> 01:24:24,722
So, of course, she felt completely safe
when she went out that night.

1140
01:24:24,847 --> 01:24:26,766
And why wouldn't she feel safe?

1141
01:24:26,891 --> 01:24:30,520
She was doing exactly what everybody else
down there was doing,

1142
01:24:30,645 --> 01:24:36,109
celebrating with her friends, having fun.
She was a smart girl.

1143
01:24:36,984 --> 01:24:39,529
It never occurred to her or to me

1144
01:24:39,654 --> 01:24:43,241
that she wouldn't recognise danger
when it crossed her path.

1145
01:24:44,325 --> 01:24:47,703
<i>But when you're away from home,</i>
<i>in an unfamiliar place,</i>

1146
01:24:47,829 --> 01:24:50,706
<i>danger does not look like</i>
<i>what you expect.</i>

1147
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,960
<i>You can't let your guard down,</i>
<i>even for a moment.</i>

1148
01:24:54,085 --> 01:24:58,548
<i>You have to make sure you don't get into</i>
<i>a situation where you lose control</i>

1149
01:24:58,673 --> 01:25:00,842
<i>and you can't make your own decisions.</i>

1150
01:25:00,967 --> 01:25:03,886
<i>Plan how you will end your evening.</i>

1151
01:25:04,011 --> 01:25:07,682
<i>Plan how you'll get home,</i>
<i>even more than you plan the beginning.</i>

1152
01:25:07,807 --> 01:25:11,727
<i>And no matter what happens,</i>
<i>stick to your plan.</i>

1153
01:25:12,186 --> 01:25:17,608
<i>And most important of all,</i>
<i>never get into a car with a stranger,</i>

1154
01:25:18,109 --> 01:25:20,445
<i>no matter how safe you may feel.</i>

1155
01:25:21,696 --> 01:25:25,825
<i>Don't do it. Don't do it.</i>
<i>Please, don't do it.</i>

1156
01:25:31,414 --> 01:25:33,416
<i>We want you to come home.</i>

1157
01:25:36,377 --> 01:25:39,672
<i>We want all of you to come home.</i>
