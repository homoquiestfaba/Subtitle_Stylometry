00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Subbed by EhLaNa

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,600
Jeff Dunham, I'm talking to you my man.
This is your night and this is your time.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,400
You're gonna put the smackdown on that crowd like 50 Cent.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,500
You're gonna get it crunk like Usher.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,800
Like the Ushers?

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh man, I gotta think white, think white...

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,500
- You mean: going to do well like Toby Keith.
- Huh?

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,300
- I think I get it.
- You're my man Jeff.

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,400
Thanks Sweet Daddy.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Group hug?

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,100
What???

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,800
Uh...Ok Jeff.
You can put me down now...

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,700
We got a show to do.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,800
They're waiting for ya.

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,400
Ah...Shit

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,300
JEFF DUNHAM:
"Arguing with Myself"

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,600
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Jeff Dunham.

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,000
Thank you!

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,400
Thank you so much!

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,800
Alright!

21
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,900
Thank you

22
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,500
You are assuming way to much,
ladies and gentlemen

23
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,600
But thanks for coming out tonight.
I am happy to be in Orange County.

24
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,800
I'm happy to be in Santa Ana.

25
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,500
My mother-in-law had a dance studio.
She had this dance studio for 30 years.

26
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,400
She owned it and she ran it.

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,100
A few months ago, she was 4 days away
from closing the sail on the dance studio

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,400
She was gonna take the money, retire,
be independent and live out the rest of her life.

29
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:39,000
Then, the hurricanes came...
Guess where my mother-in-laws dance studio was?!

30
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,400
West Palm Beach,
Florida.

31
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,000
Guess who's living with me
and my family now in Los Angeles??!!

32
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,400
I'll say it again: I am happy to be in Santa Ana.

33
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,700
Where is Chris Rock,
when you need the man?

34
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,700
In one house, it's me,
my wife, three little girls

35
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,400
..3 female dogs, 2 female rats
, 1 female fish

36
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,300
Now my mother-in-law and
as a bonus, my sister-in-law.

37
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,300
I am growing a uterus as we speak.

38
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,100
The only other male in the household,
is my golden retriever: Bill.

39
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
And they had him neutered.

40
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,800
Oh, it's very sad. I came home
after being gone for about 5 days

41
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,300
I walked in the front door.
Bill is lying on the coach.

42
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
He looks up like:
"Dude...

43
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,000
You're not going to believe
what they did to me...

44
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,400
"Run!"

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Who is this?

46
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,900
Ladies, meet me in the green room!!

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,600
Well, our daughters are now 8, 10
and god forbid, 14 years of age.

48
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,500
Thanks for your sympathy.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
My wife and I recognize that we are
living on the verge of hell.

50
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,500
Because from what I understand,
when woman live in the same house,

51
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,800
apparently, God has a sense of humor.

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,700
Because eventually their biological time clocks synchronize

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,400
So I know when all my daughters get to be that age,

54
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,300
I'll be sitting on the phone with my agent
every 3 and a half weeks going:

55
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,800
"You gotta get me the hell out of here!!"

56
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,800
My office door will be locked and all I hear is:

57
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,400
"Daddy...

58
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,900
Let us in..."

59
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,900
Bill will be sitting next to me:
"Don't open the door!"

60
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,000
Well, I know that some of you know
what's going on this evening.

61
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,000
I have little people in boxes and ahh...

62
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,800
I gotta tell ya,
the way security is at the airports nowadays

63
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,400
when you try and check in
with a small person in your luggage...

64
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,500
They stop ya.

65
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,800
Most airports nowadays have the sophisticated
equipment for checking your luggage

66
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,400
They are like big MRIs,
they can check the contents, the materials...

67
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,700
but some of the smaller airports, don't.
We all know Burbank airport,
just north of here a few miles.

68
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,100
Don't have all the sophisticated stuff,
they still have to handcheck a lot of luggage.

69
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,300
I was in line, about 3 1/2 weeks ago,
early one morning, very crowded

70
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,400
And most people, when you get your
luggage handchecked, it's no big deal

71
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,200
They might pull out your underwear, like uhw..

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,700
But for me, they're pulling out dolls.

73
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,200
I told him not to
do that joke.

74
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,700
And I figured out the way they decide,
who's luggage they're gonna handcheck

75
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,500
It is a complete judgement call
on these guys parts.

76
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,700
They look at you and they decide and
apparently I look like a terrorist with a trunk.

77
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,500
Because as:"Sir, I gotta take a look at that trunk".
I'm like: "Uh crap, here we go!"

78
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,600
So he takes the big trunk and
he puts it on the top of the silver table

79
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,000
He opens it up and the first thing he pulls out
is one of my little guys: Peanut.

80
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,700
You'll see him in a little while,
you know my little Peanut.

81
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,500
But he pulls Peanut out and he's like: "He."
and people in line are like: "Hey!"

82
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,000
And I'm like "Ohh..."

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,300
Now, they have these swabs and
they swab whatever it is they're looking at

84
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,700
they then take the piece of material,
they put it in the analyzer

85
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,900
it then checks to see if your stuff has come
into contact with anything dangerous.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,700
Chemicals or whatever.

87
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,600
So the guy has Peanut in one hand,
swab in the other

88
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,500
This is all true, it's too stupid to make up.

89
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,900
He could have swabbed Peanut
on the head, on the foot...

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,500
No, in front of God and everybody,
he swabs his butt, just like that.

91
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,200
I know it's only a puppet...
But I work with the guy.

92
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,300
There's a relationship here!

93
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,500
And I'm sitting there watching this and
the first thing I find myself thinking is:

94
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
You sick bastard!

95
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,800
What the hell...?!

96
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,300
Why are you wiping my friends butt?

97
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,600
He then takes the swab,
puts it in the machine, shuts the door

98
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,000
I think we're finished.
We start to put things away....

99
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,001
Suddenly the little machine goes:

100
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,800
Three more guys come out,
they have me up against the wall.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,300
they're checking my ID,
they're doing a background check on the internet.

102
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,600
They're going through all my stuff,
takes 15 minutes.

103
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,900
Now we're finished
Everything is fine.

104
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,400
Then we start to put things back
and then I start to think...

105
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,300
What the hell...

106
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,600
was on Peanuts butt...

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,300
that labelled me the potential terrorist?

108
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,700
This is all true and I asked the guy
and he goes:

109
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,700
Well, it's all in code on the computer.
Let's see.

110
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,300
He goes: "Eh, that would be militairy grade
plastic explosives". And I go: "Hehehe.."

111
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,700
"What???"

112
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,500
And he goes: "Well, sometimes the machine confuses lotion for that..."

113
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,400
And I went: "Haha!
No, there is no lotion on the puppets ass!"

114
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,200
I've been building bombs in my garage.

115
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,900
You caught me skippy!

116
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,800
Thanks for
straightening me out!

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,900
I don't ever want to go
through the Burbank airport again.

118
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,700
There was only a small number of
these guys doing all the checking

119
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,400
I know the next time I'll go through,
they'll all be standing in a group
and one of them will point and go:

120
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,000
"There he is! There's the gay puppet bomber!"

121
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,600
"There's lotion on his puppets ass"

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,200
You two girls are twins right?

123
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Ladies and gentlemen, I have a few guys
to introduce to you tonight

124
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,100
The first guy I met years ago
when I was still in college

125
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,100
and he's a Vietnam war veteran

126
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,100
And he was a welder at the time.

127
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,100
He'd been married for many, many years

128
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,300
And he was just tired of being in the house
and wanted to get out

129
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,100
He saw what I did on weekends

130
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,300
He thought it would be fun just to
get up in front of people and just talk

131
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,900
give his point of views
on all kinds of subjects.

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,400
So we tried it a few times,
I thought he was great

133
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,000
We've been a team ever since.
Please help me welcome my old friend: Walter

134
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,500
Shut the hell up!

135
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,700
- Walter, you're happy to be here?
- Oh, overjoyed!

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,400
Last week, I was lying on a beach in Mali
and I couldn't decide

137
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Should I stay in Hawai or go to friggin Santa Ana?

138
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,000
My God, I can die happy now!

139
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,700
- Fine city
- I don't give a damn

140
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,500
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't know

141
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,100
It's hot as hell outside,
my skin is a drie and itchy,

142
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,400
You put me in a sweater

143
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Sure as hell, not gonna ask you for lotion.

144
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,400
- You know you don't have to do this
- Yeah, I can get a real job

145
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,600
- What would you do?
- I wanna be a greeter at Wal-Mart

146
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,000
What the hell is so funny?!

147
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,300
At Wal-Mart,
what would be your opening line?

148
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,900
Welcome to Wal-Mart,
get your shit and get out!

149
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,600
Have a nice day.

150
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,400
- Anything else wrong?
- I don't know

151
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,000
My wife and I couldn't find any place to park
anywhere near this stinkin joint

152
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,500
And some jerk pulled up in a brand new mercedes,
goes right in the handicap spot.

153
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,700
He gets out of the car and
there's nothing wrong with him.

154
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:15,101
Don't you hate that?

155
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,400
So I ran his ass over.

156
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,300
I made an honest man out of him.

157
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,000
And his mother got out the other side,
started swinging her crutches at me.

158
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,300
Took her out with the door.

159
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,800
- Don't you feel kinda bad?
- Oh hell, ain't carpool

160
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,800
- Do you think the police didn't see ya?
- I ain't afraid of the cops around Santa Ana

161
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,300
- You seen some of these guys?
- What?

162
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
Cops on bicycles.

163
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
- What's wrong with that?
- How intimidating is this:

164
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,200
"Sorry buddy, pull it over"

165
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,200
What do they do when they arrest somebody?
"Alright, in the basket"

166
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,800
Yes ladies...
I wrote that joke.

167
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah, you can tell the rookie cops.
They got playing cards in their spokes.

168
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:22,001
"Halt!"

169
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,400
- So your wife's in town?
- Oh, yeah!

170
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,000
- She's having a good time?
- She always has a good time

171
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,300
Pisses me off

172
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,500
- She's a lovely lady!
- She's gettin old

173
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,700
Well, women age like fine wine

174
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,300
She's aging like milk

175
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,700
- Did you guys get into another argument this morning?
- Yeah

176
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,900
- What happened?
- I don't know

177
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,900
She rolled out of bed,
jumped on her minstrel cycle

178
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
and ran my ass over.

179
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,600
Never heard it put quite that way before

180
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,000
Oh it even has a sound.
It goes:

181
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:18,600
<Nag, nag, bitch, bitch>

182
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,700
- How long have you been married?
- Uh, what is it now? 46 years

183
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
What was the happiest moment of your life?

184
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,800
47 years ago

185
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,600
- How long have you been married?
- 15 years

186
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,700
You'll see

187
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,700
- I'll see what?
- Remember when you said:

188
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,700
- "Till death do us part"?
- Yeah

189
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,800
Later, you'll realize
you're actually setting a goal.

190
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,800
- Walter, what exactly is marriage to you?
- It's like drinking a slurpy

191
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,900
First couple of sips are like:
"Boy, this is really good. I'm glad I did this"

192
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,500
Then you keep drinking it,
goes right to your head and you go..

193
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,900
"What the hell was I thinking?!"

194
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,400
"Someone kill me please!"

195
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,300
But eventually it stops hurting

196
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,100
Yeah, but then you're stupid enough
to take another friggin sip.

197
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,800
- Ain't the same anymore is it?
- What?

198
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,600
Being married all these years.
You can't look at other women now.

199
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,200
you can't talk to them,
you can't do nothing.

200
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,800
- What are you talking about?
- I'll show you what I'm talking about...

201
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,000
See this lovely young lady
sitting right here in the front row

202
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,700
This gorgeous young thing?

203
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,500
- Do you see her?
- Yeah...

204
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,200
Oh well...

205
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,700
Only thing you can do now
is run to the end of your chain and bark.

206
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,300
Getting married is kind of
like buying a new car

207
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,900
You know when you see that car in the
showroom floor just before you take it home...

208
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,100
- Yeah..
- That is as good as it's ever gonna look

209
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,900
Pretty soon, it will have dents and scratches.
Parts start to go bad.

210
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,500
Then the new models comes out
and then you're like:...

211
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:34,300
"Honey, can I just sit in it?"
No, remember?

212
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,100
- Walter, how's the love life?
- You mean sex?

213
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,200
- Yes
- I'm married, you morron!

214
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,700
- I'm too old too
- You're not too old

215
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,400
- How would you know?
- Well, I don't know, but I do know

216
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,300
I had grandparents who well into their eighties,
where still having fun.

217
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,200
Their eighties?
Good God...

218
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,400
What the hell kinda sex is that?

219
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,500
- "Was it good for you?"
- "I can't remember"

220
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,100
- "We just finished!"
- "Who are you?"

221
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,400
Are you trying to tell me there's nothing
sexually going on between you and your wife?

222
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,200
It's very difficult.
She gripes about everything.

223
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,700
Like what?

224
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,300
She said I don't make
the right noises during sex

225
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,200
- Sorry to hear that
- Wanna hear what I do?

226
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,300
No

227
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,300
- Alright, you talked me into it.
- Wait a minute...

228
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,100
Now be careful,
these are gonna be kind of pornographic

229
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,800
"Get off"

230
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,300
"I can't see the weather channel!"

231
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,800
"Get the hell off!"

232
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,000
Oh, now that's funny!
Wait, no it's not.

233
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:05,500
I know you know better than I do, but I mean
is there any kind of foreplay for you guys?

234
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,300
Foreplay?
At our age?

235
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,600
Yeah, it's come down to:
"Hey, wake up!"

236
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,200
- You know what oral sex for us is?
- What?

237
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,700
She screams: "Screw you!"
and I yell: "Bite me!"

238
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,500
Come on Walter, at your age,
how do you keep things fresh in the bedroom?

239
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,200
BRISE.

240
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,500
I don't know. My wife and I heard
that coffee's good for your sex life

241
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,000
Coffee?
Is it?

242
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,500
No, it kept me awake
through the whole damn thing.

243
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,900
I actually had to participate!

244
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,500
Doctor said it's bad for my heart too.

245
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,600
- Oh, the caffeine?
- No, seeing my wife naked

246
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,800
- That's awful!
- Oh, you seen her too?

247
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,700
So, is coffee good for the sex life or not?

248
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,000
I don't know, but they're never gonna
let us go back into that Starbucks again!

249
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
Well, we used the filter!

250
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,400
You know Walter -despite how you act-, I bet when
you were younger you were quite a ladiesman

251
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,900
I used to chase skirts all over the world.

252
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,900
- Really?
- Till I got to Scotland...

253
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
and boy, was I surprised!

254
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,000
- So you had women everywhere?
- I even dated a girl in India

255
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,200
-  Really?
- Lovely young lady. Weird ass country.

256
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,200
- What's wrong with India?
- I don't now

257
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,200
Most of the women got a red dot
in the middle of their forehead.

258
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,800
What the hell is that?
"You are here"

259
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Maybe it lights up
when the coffee is ready?

260
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,000
Sorry

261
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,400
- "Scratch it off, you friggin win something!!"
- Will you stop?!

262
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
How about this: "Hey looks like
she's videotaping me all the time!"

263
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,800
As everybody was coming in tonight, they were
given an opportunity or two to ask you a question

264
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,600
So before the show started, I grabbed a small handful.
I think you should answer them.

265
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,200
I don't give a damn

266
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,600
You pall here in the blue shirt, in the front row...
You filled one out?

267
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,900
Hello!

268
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,700
DID YOU FILL ONE OUT?

269
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,500
Where are you going?!
Sit the hell down!

270
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,000
You bastard, this is TV!

271
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,500
What the hell?

272
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Think he's gonna take a piss?

273
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:33,000
These are expensive tickets, extensive set-up,
lot of production

274
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,500
Divide it all up, if he's gone for 3 minutes,
he's taking a 600 dollar piss!

275
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,400
Dumbass.

276
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Is he coming back?

277
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,400
Ok

278
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,400
We'll wait.

279
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,900
- What's that guys first name?
- Mike!

280
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,800
Mike.
Dumbass.

281
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,000
- Are there speakers up in the bathroom?
- Yes

282
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,300
Oh Mike!!

283
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,900
Whe are waiting for you, Mike!!

284
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,600
Kinda of tough to go
with all this pressure isn't it, Mike?!

285
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,600
Mike!

286
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,700
Get out!!

287
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,100
Mike's taking a long time...

288
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Could be having trouble...

289
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,800
What does Mike do for a living?

290
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,400
Transportations

291
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,100
He does transportation?

292
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
What the hell does that mean?

293
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,500
Medical transportation

294
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,400
Medical transportation?!

295
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,300
What the fuck is that?!

296
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,300
Welcome back, dumbass!

297
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,600
Mike, could you hear us in there?

298
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,400
Mike!

299
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,200
Somebody pull his string.
He's not talking.

300
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,200
Mike, could you hear us in there?

301
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,100
I could't hear it.

302
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,400
Well, we could hear you.

303
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
And you didn't wash your hands!

304
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,100
I don't give a damn

305
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,300
Back to you, asswhole.

306
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,100
I'm sorry, just kiddin around.
What is your first name, here in the blue shirt?

307
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,300
Nick.

308
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,000
Nick, what do you do for a living?

309
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,400
- I work in construction
- What kind of construction?

310
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,400
- I work with a general contractor
- With a general contractor

311
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,100
You're not the general contractor?
You work WITH one.

312
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,600
- So what is your title, Nick?
- I guess you could consider it framing and drywalling.

313
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,500
framing and drywalling...

314
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,200
Got anything for that, dumbass?

315
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,900
You know Nick, we got jokes for doctors
and lawyers and even trash collectors.

316
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,500
But the framing and drywalling guy...

317
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,000
Not in our arsenal of snatty come-backs!

318
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,500
Now we're not gonna bother
going home and writing any

319
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,600
cos hey...
what are the fucking odds now ?

320
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,500
I'm sorry

321
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,600
- It was Nick right?
- Yeah

322
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,300
Nick and Mike.
Mike and Nick.

323
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,600
Dumbasses.

324
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,400
- Would you be nice to the crowd?
- I don't give a damn

325
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,200
- Some of the folks signed these and some of them didn't
- I don't give a damn

326
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:18,100
- Where is Valerie...? What is it?
- What is it... Ramney... Ramsey...

327
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,200
- Valerie, where are ya?
- Right there

328
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,300
"Dear Walter, how do you take
off ten years to look younger?"

329
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,900
Oh, me? That would be Thompson's WaterSeal.

330
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,900
This is from Milton: "Dear Walter,
my wife sits at home all day and won't work."

331
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,300
"How can I get her to get a job?"

332
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,800
Well Milton, you're going to have to die.

333
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500
That'll teach the bitch!

334
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,900
- Where is Nick Manos?
- Right here!

335
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Nick!

336
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,100
Nick says: "Dear Walter,
you're looking a little frustrated."

337
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,600
"When is the last time you got laid?"

338
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,400
Oh crap, I recognize him.
That's our gay stalker!

339
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,500
I need medical transportation!

340
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,600
This is from Steven: "Dear Walter,
could you please recommend a good proctologist?"

341
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,700
Tony Whittier.
Oh, Tony from Whittier, California.

342
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,200
- Pay attention, idiot
- I'm sorry

343
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,900
"Dear Walter, time and time again
I have filled out this sheet, 6 times."

344
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,700
"You never answer my question. What gives?"

345
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,900
- Let's skip that one
- Ok

346
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,500
This is from Chris,
it's a girl Chris

347
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,400
"Dear..."
You read this

348
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:35,100
"Dear Walter, after 9 1/2 years my boyfriend
still hasn't 'popped' the question"

349
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,900
That says 'poop' the question!!

350
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,800
Chris, you need to learn to spell I think

351
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,900
How the hell do you 'poop' the question?

352
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,800
I guess you should
listen from the other end...

353
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,800
"Dear Walter, why don't chicken
breasts have nipples?"

354
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,200
What?!

355
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,600
I guess cos if they got too cold,
they'd poke a whole in the package.

356
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:32,800
New from the Colonel:
"Chicken and Tits"

357
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,200
"Dear Walter, what is one of Jeffs
deepest darkest secrets?"

358
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,800
He has a sex blow up doll

359
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,800
- No I don't
- Yes you do

360
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,300
- No
- Yes and the sick part is...

361
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,900
he makes her talk...

362
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,400
- And boy, does she lie!
- Will you stop it!

363
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,700
"Dear Walter, what was your
favorite toy as a child?"

364
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,000
Dirt

365
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,700
And we were happy

366
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:13,100
Kids nowadays, they have too much.
They got the internet, videogames, computer crap.

367
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,600
Hell they're even passing out condoms
in highschools, did you know that?

368
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,600
- Yeah
- Good God

369
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:22,700
When I was that age, we had to
walk 5 miles to get a condom

370
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,000
Up hill.

371
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,000
In the snow.

372
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,000
- With a boner!
- Oh stop it!

373
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,500
I threw this one away, cos
I thought it was kinda over the line

374
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,900
but I think we crossed that
a couple of times

375
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,900
- You read it
- Why?

376
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,800
- I just can't. You read it.
- Ok, I don't care

377
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,700
"Dear Walter, why is it that I
gag when I brush my tongue,

378
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,100
but not when I give my boyfriend oral sex?"

379
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Well obviously, your toothbrush is bigger

380
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,300
That's Walter! There we go! Alright!

381
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,400
Thank you!

382
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,600
Thank you so much

383
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,700
And now ladies and gentlemen...

384
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,600
Folks, every once in a while, a fear in showbusiness

385
00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:37,501
you feel the need to reinvent yourself.
Redo things.

386
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,400
Make the creative juices keep flowing

387
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,000
I felt not long ago,
it was time for me to do that

388
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,700
so I fired my current manager
and hired a new one.

389
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,500
He's actually here this evening and before I go
any further, he wanted to come out and say a few words

390
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,800
We are getting to know eachother,
he's getting to know my audiences.

391
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:56,000
I think you're really going to enjoy him,
because he's a smart guy. I really respect him.

392
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,600
Please help me welcome
my new manager Sweet Daddy D.

393
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,500
Well, it's about time.
These folks were waiting to see me...

394
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:24,200
- How are you doing Sweet Daddy?
- Oh no, it's not Sweet Daddy, it's Sweet Daddy D.

395
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,100
Well, I'm happy to call
you my new manager

396
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,100
I'm what you call a player
in a management profession.

397
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
Right.

398
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,800
P.I.M.P.

399
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,500
- You're a pimp?
- That makes you the hoe!

400
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,200
- I'm not a whore
- What do you do for a living?

401
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,900
- Make people laugh
- Make them feel good?

402
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,900
- Right
- You're the hoe

403
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,200
- That's not right
- Why do you do what you do?

404
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,500
Why? Because I enjoy it and it's
the best way I know to make money

405
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,600
You're the hoe!

406
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,500
Wait a minute, what if I said
I only do it because of the money?

407
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,600
You're the dumb hoe.

408
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,400
So what ideas do
you have for my career?

409
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,800
The first thing I gotta
do is school you in street

410
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,100
- Street?
- Word

411
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,300
- What?
- Word

412
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,200
What word?

413
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,800
What?

414
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,700
- You said: "Word".
- Word

415
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,700
- What word?
- Oh snap, what the hell?

416
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,000
Dog, "word" is like:
"I heard that?"

417
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,100
- Heard what?
- Oh shit

418
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,800
Dog, you are not white.
You're neon white

419
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,000
You're so white,
you make Barry Manilow look like a brother.

420
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,000
- I like Barry Manilow.
- Are you gay?

421
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,100
No

422
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
I heard about the lotion.

423
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,800
- I'm not gay
- You're just white.

424
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,900
- Yeah
- It's all good

425
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
- Look, do you think this is gonna work between us?
- Let's make an analogy here...

426
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,800
If we were food...

427
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:16,300
I would be a fine summer wine
that would be divine anytime

428
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:25,200
- What about me?
- Every good wine needs a cracker!

429
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,600
That's funny shit right there!

430
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,000
You gotta laugh at that shit

431
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,600
We got a fine hoochy
momma right here

432
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,700
Hello??!!!

433
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,600
You're looking to go home
with some real wood?

434
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,000
You like it?!

435
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,100
I may be short, but it
ain't my feet holding me up

436
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,900
- Sweet Daddy, what are you doing?
- Trying to find me some hoes, dog!

437
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,000
Hoes?

438
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,500
Oh you mean women!
Oh I got it!

439
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,300
Word!!!

440
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,900
Don't you ever do that again!!

441
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,300
I don't know what the hell that was, but
you just embarrassed the hell out of everybody

442
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,500
Even the white folks are sitting there going:
"What the fuck was that?"

443
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,400
You know us black folks got a saying

444
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,600
- Stay black
- Right.

445
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,300
- I got some advice for you
- What?

446
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,100
Stay white

447
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,900
I know a lot of white people
emulate the Afro-American culture

448
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,700
- To make themselves seem cooler.
- Yeah, us black folks got a word for that...

449
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
- What?
- Irritating

450
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,200
So I'll say it again and it goes
for most everybody in this room

451
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,800
I'll stay black,
You stay white.

452
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,400
As for my Mexican
brothers and sisters...

453
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,000
You learn English mothafuckers,
how bout that?

454
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,500
That's funny shit right there!

455
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,600
Oh Lord, I'm glad
I'm going home in a suitcase

456
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,700
Look Sweet Daddy, who
are some of your other clients?

457
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,900
- I can't tell you that...
- Why?

458
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,200
- I gotta protect their anonymity
- Well...

459
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,100
Give us a hint then.
How bout some initials?

460
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,200
O.J.
Oh shit!

461
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,600
- So you have some athletes and former athletes?
- Oh, sure enough

462
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,100
- So you like sports?
- Oh yeah

463
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,900
I like sports,
lets talk about sports

464
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,500
What do you think about the
hockey strike we had not long ago?

465
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,100
The what...?

466
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,400
- You know, the hockey strike
- Oh yeah

467
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,300
Me and all the brothers were laying
around the hood everyday going:

468
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,400
"Oh Lord, what do we do with no hockey?!"

469
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,400
"Thank the Lord, we got NASCAR!"

470
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,200
NASCAR, that's another
dumbass crack of sport!

471
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,500
- NASCAR is very popular
- I know that, I just don't get it!

472
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,200
Lots of grown, white men going
500 miles, in a circle?!

473
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,300
What the hell?!

474
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,000
What kind of sleen half (?) is this:
"Look, they're making a left turn"

475
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,500
"Oh, they're making another left turn"

476
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,800
"Oh, they're making another left turn"

477
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,400
I wonder what's gonna happen next???

478
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,000
"Let's go to commercial, come back in 10 minutes,

479
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,600
you ain't gonna miss a fuckin thing!"

480
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,500
He is that the dude that Walter was talking to?

481
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,300
Right there

482
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,200
I was talking to him
outside before the show

483
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,300
He was dissin me
on my threads

484
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,200
- Oh, he didn't like your clothes
- That's right

485
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:05,600
And he asks: "How come your name is Sweet
Daddy?" You know what I said to him?

486
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,600
Ask your momma!!

487
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,000
Don't get all up in my grill dog,
you know it ain't just me up here...

488
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,300
And if I'm not funny,
it's not my fault

489
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,000
- See dog, I'm kinda like coffee
- Coffee?

490
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:29,800
Yeah, before you experience my brown goodness...
I gotta go through a big ass white filter.

491
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,900
That's funny shit right there!

492
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,300
- So Sweet Daddy, do you like the audience here?
- I love your crowd...

493
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,800
But I feel a little bit outnumber...

494
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,900
Is there one other brother
in the house tonight?

495
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,500
Yo dog!
Run!

496
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,100
Start up the car, I need you
out back after the show!

497
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,300
It's like we're at a Dwight Yokum concert,
or some shit like that

498
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,200
Look Sweet Daddy, before you go...
Why did you choose me as a client?

499
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,800
- Because you're safe.
- I'm what?

500
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,500
I gotta lot of clients ending up in jail and in trouble.
I don't see you putting your ass in jail anytime soon.

501
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:18,501
<nothing>

502
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,200
Unless of course,
they make lotion illegal...

503
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:30,100
- Will you please drop the lotion?
- Ok, but I ain't picking it up anywhere near your ass!

504
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,100
That's Sweet Daddy D!

505
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,500
Thank you!

506
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:45,500
And now ladies and gentlemen,
how do we describe this next guy?

507
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,900
Pretty much just white, trash trailer park.

508
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,200
Please help me welcome, Bubba J.

509
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,700
- How are you doing Bubba J?
- I'm doing pretty good!

510
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,700
- Well, I'm glad you're here
- Yeah, I was fixin' to coming here

511
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,200
And I went out the
front door to come here

512
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,200
And I came here,
and I got here

513
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,200
And here I am!

514
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,800
So Bubba J,
what does the J stand for?

515
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,600
My last name is Junior.

516
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,600
- It's a good thing they didn't name you Junior
- Yeah, that'll be dumb: Junior Junior.

517
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,000
That's my brothers name.

518
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,600
What have you been doing today?

519
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,700
I've been watching NASCAR
and drinking beer!

520
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,500
- That's your favorite sport
- Yeah, NASCAR is too!

521
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,400
NASCAR is very hot right now.

522
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,600
I know, everybody loves NASCAR!

523
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,300
Well, Sweet Daddy says it's just
a bunch of guys driving in a circle.

524
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,300
I know, that's my favorite part

525
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,600
"They're making a left turn!"

526
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,600
It's a sport that's easy
to follow when you're hammered.

527
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:21,400
- I understand you got a new tattoo
- Yeah, I got another somewhere else...

528
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,200
that'll grow...

529
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,800
- Did you get it?
- They got it!

530
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,500
I'm tired of hearing that most
NASCAR fans drink too much.

531
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,000
- Cos it's not true?
- Oh no, it's true...

532
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,600
I'm just tired of hearing it.

533
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,800
Makes me thirsty for another beer

534
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,900
- Besides beer, do you ever have wine at the track?
- Yeah, but we have boxed wine...

535
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,600
Yeah, it's wine that comes in a box

536
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,900
It's great, cos if you had too much to drink,
then you got something to throw up in.

537
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,300
Bubba J, don't you
worry about your health?

538
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,800
- Huh?
- Your health...

539
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,700
- Like what?
- Your liver...

540
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,900
No

541
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
My last abduction
with the aliens took it.

542
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,600
- You think you got abducted by aliens?
- I don't think, I know!!!

543
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:20,200
They took me and they
stuck something in my butt.

544
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:26,000
And not in the good way...

545
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,600
When you go to a NASCAR race
and you party a lot,

546
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,200
who is your designated driver?

547
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,800
What the fuck is that?

548
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
- Do you drive drunk?
- No officer!!

549
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,300
I'm practising

550
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,200
- Have you ever had an intervention?
- Yeah, and penicillin cleared her right of him

551
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,900
Stupid cousin

552
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,400
It was a second cousin!

553
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,600
That's a grey area

554
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,600
- Do you play any sports yourself?
- Does 'QUARTERS' count?

555
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,800
No

556
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:28,700
- Do you got a drinking problem?
- No, I pretty much got it figured out

557
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,200
- What's your favorite beer?
- An open one

558
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:44,000
- And how do you know when you had too much?
- I run out

559
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,500
Have you ever been to an
Alcoholics Anonymous meeting?

560
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,100
A.A. is for quiters

561
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,200
He, Mister Dunham, I was wondering...
What is it that you do for a living?

562
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,100
- I'm a comedian
- You are?

563
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,900
- You got one of them catch frases?
- Well you know I'm a ventriloquist

564
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,200
Oh, you don't eat meat?

565
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
What?

566
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
- Bubba J, are you married?
- Oh yeah

567
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,000
- Is your wife pretty?
- Yeah...

568
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,200
No

569
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,100
- What's the difference?
- The light.

570
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,000
- Where did you meet your wife?
- At the family reunion.

571
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,100
What?!

572
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,600
- Where was this family reunion?
- At the state fair.

573
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,200
Why don't you tell us about
the first time you saw your wife?

574
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,500
Alright

575
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,600
There she was...

576
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,400
- More?
- Yeah, more!

577
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,300
- Where was she?
- She was leaning against the ferris wheel..

578
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,000
Making it tilt...

579
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,400
Sunlight, glistening off her curlers...

580
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:16,800
Corndog in one hand,
a Budweiser in the other.

581
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,200
My tattoo is growing!!

582
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,400
I went up to her and I said:
"Young woman, you look more delicious

583
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:39,100
then mayonnaise oozing
out of a spam sandwich."

584
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,800
And then she smiled...

585
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,500
What a tooth!

586
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,400
- So I guess you dated her a little while?
- Yeah, a little bit

587
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,000
- Then you proposed?
- No her daddy did that for me

588
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,700
- How did that happen?
- I was supposed to come and pick her up about 7 o'clock

589
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,000
One night, I got there at 7.30h

590
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:04,500
And her daddy was on the front
porch with his shotgun. He said:

591
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,900
"He Bubba J, guess who else is late!"

592
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,400
I'm glad you're laughing,
somebody had to explain it to me.

593
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,500
I still don't get it

594
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,500
- So I guess you had the wedding at the church?
- Yeah

595
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,200
- Had the reception?
- At Wal-Mart

596
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,800
- Wal-Mart?
- Yeah

597
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,800
- Why?
- Easier to return the gifts

598
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,300
We walked in the front door, some old
conger standing there and he goes:

599
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,900
He, welcome to Wal-Mart,
get you shit and get out!

600
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,000
- Say goodnight Bubba J.
- Goodnight!

601
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,800
I met this next guy many years ago,
also when I was in college.

602
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:55,500
He is not from the United States.
He's from a small micronesian island in the South-Pacific.

603
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,900
And he hopped a cruise ship,
I actually met him down in Florida.

604
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,600
We met up, talked a little bit, I thought he was kinda funny.
We went on stage together a few times.

605
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:08,100
He's been in my act ever since.
Please help me welcome my buddy: Peanut.

606
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,400
- How are you doing Peanut?
- I'm doing pretty good. How are you?

607
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,000
- I'm fine
- That's good, that's goood, that's gooood!

608
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,500
- Well, looks like a pretty good crowd tonight
- You like it here?

609
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,600
Oh, I love coming here to uh, uh, uh....

610
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,800
This town right here!!

611
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:36,400
- Which town?
- This one

612
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,600
- Which is?
- The one we're in right now...

613
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,100
Peanut, where are we?

614
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,300
You don't know??

615
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,200
- I don't think you know
- I forgot

616
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,900
- You forgot?
- We go to see so damn many places, I forgot!

617
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,100
- Think about it for a second
- Alright, alright, alright...

618
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,500
Damn!!!

619
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,400
- The drive from the valley
- Was bad as hell...

620
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,800
- Traffic?
- Sucked like hell...

621
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,100
- Drivers?
- Angry as hell...

622
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,500
- And you?
- Were scared as hell...

623
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,800
- Parking here?
- Sucked more like hell...

624
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,100
- So?
- We're in hell!!

625
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,700
And these are our hellmates!

626
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:35,800
Think about it, next time somebody
tells you to go to hell: "Come right here!"

627
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,600
- Where are we?
- I don't know!

628
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,200
Help me out,
help me out!!

629
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,000
Sorry

630
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,600
- I wrote it down for you
- Oh good, you wrote it down!

631
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,100
Ah yes! I love coming to...

632
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,100
Sa.

633
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,000
Nata A.

634
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Na.

635
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,500
What the hell is that?!

636
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,900
Sa Nata A Na.

637
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:14,300
What is it a friggin Indian reservation?!
What the hell?!

638
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,700
Sa Nata A Na.

639
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:31,400
It's Santa Ana.
"Santa Ana".

640
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:38,200
Look I know I didn't finish school,
but that friggin says: "Sa Nata A Na".

641
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,500
Dumbass

642
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,100
I will never blink

643
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,800
- They pronounce it: "Santa Ana".
- Well, they're wrong!

644
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,200
Sa Nata A Na.

645
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,300
- It's Santa Ana!
- Are you sure?

646
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,900
- Yeah
- Ok!

647
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,200
- You're happy to be here?
- What?

648
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,000
- You're happy to be here?
- Ohh, yes I am...

649
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,400
Just last week, I was lying in bed
and I woke up sobbing.

650
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,600
I will never be happy untill we return to...

651
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,500
Sa Nata A Na!

652
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,800
And now, we're here!!

653
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,000
Thank you for bringing me!

654
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,400
- It's a fine city
- Ok!

655
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,200
- And we're in a very nice theater
- Ok!

656
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,300
This town is great

657
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,300
It's a fine city!

658
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,500
Have you looked around?!

659
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,200
Holy crap!

660
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,600
It sucks!

661
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:32,100
- A lot of history in this city.
- Translated: "Old as shit".

662
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,600
They've been rejuvenating, refurbishing...

663
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,200
Polish a turd,
it's still a turd

664
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,200
- It's a fine city
- Ok!

665
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,800
Sorry!

666
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,400
- But the drive down here did suck
- Yes it did

667
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,400
It was in the 4 or 5 then the 5, holy crap!

668
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:12,000
Thank goodness we turned on the radio
and listened to the traffic report

669
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:15,200
- How much good did that do us?
- None what so friggin ever!

670
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,700
I hate the traffic reports.
They are a waste of time.

671
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,200
Let me do the traffic reports,
I'll save everyone a lot of time and money.

672
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,700
"He Peanut, it's eight o'clock in the morning,
there's a lot of traffic out there. What's going on?"

673
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,800
"IT'S EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING!

674
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,800
Everyone left the house
at the same damn time

675
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,200
Back to you!

676
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,100
Call me back at 5.30,
I'll tell you the same thing

677
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,100
Only guess what?
THEY ARE GOING THE OTHER WAY!

678
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,700
You know what else pissed me off today?
Try using my cell phone

679
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,000
- Having trouble?
- Just like the stinkin commercials

680
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,600
"Can you hear me know? How bout now?
Or now? Now?"

681
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:17,000
You know what you don't hear in those commercials?
The other end of the conversation!

682
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,800
What a piece of shit!

683
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:32,500
You know what cellphone sex is?
"Can you feel me now? How bout now?"

684
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,400
Stop it!

685
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,900
This guy is not getting any of this. I've been
watching him the whole time and it's all going...

686
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,500
I'm just kidding buddy.
What's your name?

687
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,700
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

688
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,200
I'm fucking looking right at ya!

689
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,400
- Aren't I?
- I think so

690
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,500
Fix my eyes asswhole

691
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,300
It's hard to talk to somebody if
you're not looking right at them.

692
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,900
It's like trying to talk to somebody who has a lazy eye.
You don't know which eye to focus on.

693
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:27,000
You're sitting there talking to them thinking:
"Oh crap, should I be looking at that eye or that eye?"

694
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,800
Focus you morron!

695
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,600
What?!

696
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,300
- What if someone here has a lazy eye?
- I'll confuse them. Here I am. Here!

697
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,400
- You know what pesto is?
- Pesto is the stuff that goes on salades and pizza.

698
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,500
No, Pesto. It's a magician with a harelip.
Pesto!

699
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,300
- What if somebody here has a harelip?
- Sorry!

700
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,600
Oh stop it!

701
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:18,100
Boy, what if they had a harelip and a lazy eye. Their really gone be: "Fissed off"

702
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,300
Back to you dude

703
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,400
I'm kidding. You right here with
the blond hair and the glasses.

704
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,500
- What is your first name?
- Terry.

705
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,000
Terry!

706
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,900
What do you do for a living, Terry?

707
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:40,000
-  I'm a business analyst
- A business analyst

708
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,000
Fascinating

709
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:47,100
How the hell does that work?
Go to a business and go:

710
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,200
"You are in business"

711
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,000
- So where were we before this?
- Before this, we were in D.C.

712
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,900
Ah yes, Washington D.C.

713
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:09,200
Doing a show in a theater.
A lovely theater.

714
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,200
About 5 minutes in the show,
I happen to look down.

715
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,800
Back where you're sitting dude, there was a guy.
Sitting right there where you are,

716
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:16,400
but he was facing THAT way.

717
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,500
And everytime I said something,
the guy went:

718
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,100
And I go: "Hey buddy, what are you doing?"
and the guy goes:

719
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,900
It was a signer.
A SIG NER

720
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,100
Think about this for a second...
They brought a bunch of deaf people to see a ventriloquist!

721
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,800
WHAT?!

722
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:47,100
What's do you do next? Go take on the
blind folks to see David Copperfield.

723
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,300
"The elephant disappeared"

724
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,600
"It just fucking disappeared"

725
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:10,900
Oh my god, he's juggling now!
You should see...Oh, sorry!

726
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
What the hell were they thinking?

727
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:18,200
And as the show went on, this guy started to piss me off.
I've never actually seen myself talk before:

728
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:22,500
So now I thought: Ok I'm gonna get even with this guy
and suddenly in the middle of the show, I went:

729
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:27,100
"He, stopsign, thank you, turn around, doing doing,
horseshoe, turtle, ughadigadigadiga."

730
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:32,700
And this poor bastard
is just signing away

731
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,100
All the deaf folks are like:

732
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,500
"What the hell is going on?"

733
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,500
"Our guy sucks"

734
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:52,300
And then the really screwed thing...
The guy went:

735
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,600
Off course, now he's just sitting there

736
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,700
All deaf folks are like:

737
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,500
"Come on!

738
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,700
What are we missing?!"

739
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,900
Sad part is...
This is all completely true.

740
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,400
We're going to hell, aren't we!?

741
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:29,100
Hop, here we are!

742
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:43,100
Oh check it out!
Look, look, look, look

743
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,000
- Are you ready?
- Si seor

744
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,600
There's something the new folks don't know.
Tell them what you are...

745
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,200
I am the jalapeo on the stick

746
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,600
- That our jalapeo...on a stick
- S.

747
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,000
- Tell them your name
- My name Jos.

748
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:09,000
- Jos what?
- Jos Jalapeo.

749
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,300
On a stick

750
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:16,400
- And your Mexican?
- No seor. Mexicans are from Mexico

751
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,100
I am Cuban

752
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,200
I'm from Florida

753
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,600
- I understand you guys had a good day today?
- Yes, we had a great day

754
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,100
- No we did not
- Yes

755
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:27,700
- No.
- Yes.

756
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,200
No, we did not have a good day

757
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,700
Yes, we GGGAVE...

758
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:36,100

759
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,800
What?!

760
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:42,800
- Did you have a good day?
- Yeah

761
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,600
- No.
- Shut up.

762
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:46,100
- A good day?
- Yes

763
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,700
- No.
- Shut up.

764
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,500
- You're supposed to have taking him to the spa
- I took him to the spa

765
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,600
He put me in
the vegetable steamer

766
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,400
It's the same thing!

767
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,000
It's not the same thing!

768
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:10,400
It is too. It gets hot
and it gets steamy and then it goes:

769
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,700
Purple bastard!

770
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,300
Mexican condiment

771
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,200
- A condiment?
- I do not use them

772
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
- You don't?
- Neither did your mother

773
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,100
Oh, that is funny shit right there!
That is funny shit!

774
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,000
Wow! That was really good!

775
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,500
You gotta work on it a little though

776
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,000
- Why?
- Cos from here it sounded like

777
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:51,400
it came out of my ass

778
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:56,300
Now I have somewhere to put my stick

779
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,800
Oh yeah?!
Well your mother is a corndog!

780
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,100
On a stick!

781
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,700
- Look Jos, are you happy?
- S, seor. I am happy

782
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,800
What the hell is "GGGappy"?

783
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
- Are you always happy?
- I'm not happy on Halloween

784
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:21,600
What the GGGell is wrong
with GGGalloween?

785
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:28,700
There are no costumes on a stick

786
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,400
You could be a fudgesicle

787
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,000
- Did anything else happen today?
- No!

788
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,300
- Si
- Damn!

789
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,500
- What else happened?
- We were getting out of the car today

790
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,800
He slam my stick in the door

791
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,800
And now I have a sore stick

792
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,100
Peanut did you apologize?

793
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,000
- No.
- Why not?

794
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,600
Cos I couldn't breathe!

795
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:07,300
- Why couldn't you breathe?
- Because he was laughing too hard

796
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:16,600
Man, it was funny!
He looked like a hood ornament from taco bell!

797
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,200
- I think you just have to apologize.
- Alright, alright, alright

798
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,200
Jos, I'm sorry

799
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,800
It's ok

800
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:27,300
I hope you die

801
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,200
Look, you're just gonna
have to be nicer to him

802
01:00:29,201 --> 01:00:30,201
- Como estas usted?
- Muy bien

803
01:00:30,302 --> 01:00:32,702
- Quieres algo de beber
- Pues si, bueno

804
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,900
- What are you doing?
- I'm speaking to Jos in his native tongue

805
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,900
- Well, don't do that
- Why not?

806
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,500
Well... It makes me feel...
left out...

807
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,100
What?!

808
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,700
I don't speak Spanish

809
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,800
Picture if you will...

810
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:08,100
Look Jos, you're an unusual kinda guy,
what makes you happiest in life?

811
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,400
- My BMW.
- He has a BMW.

812
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:15,300
Yeah, Big Mexican Woman

813
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,900
On a stick!

814
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,800
- Jos, would you feel better in the box?
- It's most nicer in the box

815
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:25,500
Wow dude!
I thought you were gonna drop him...

816
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,100
That would have been funny as hell...

817
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,800
- Do not drop me seor
- I won't drop you, Jos

818
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:35,900
I would be Jos Jalapeo...
on the floor

819
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:40,100
Do a little tapdance
and we got salsa!

820
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:49,300
- That's terrible!
- Not with the right kind of chips it's not

821
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,600
- I'm sorry Jos.
- It's ok

822
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:53,700
I kick his ass later

823
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,100
- I'll turn your ass into guacamole.
- Stop it!

824
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,500
I'll stir you with your own stick!

825
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,400
This is the way we stir the guac...
Stir the guac...Stir the guac...

826
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,000
Ol!

827
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,700
- I'm sorry Jos.
-  It's ok

828
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,600
Don't close the door

829
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:14,200
- Why not?

845
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:56,500
You can't sing

862
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,500
No.

863
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,300

872
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000

874
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,300

I don't abuse drugs

877
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,300
Ok.

878
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,000
- Come on, you gotta at least smoke weed?
- No.

879
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,600
- I don't smoke pot.
- Ever?

880
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,200

You're a sick man!

884

885
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,600
- Jeff does not abuse drugs
- Thank you

886
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:35,700
He's an alcoholic

887
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,200
That would be funny as hell,
a drunk ventriloquist

888
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:43,500
"Look, I can talk without moving my lips!"

889
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:55,000
- You should get drunk and go to a strip joint
- Why?

890
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:59,400
You would be throwing your voice
in places it should neeever come from

891
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,600
Some girl comes dancing up to the table
and everybody hears:

892
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,900
"Let me out!

893
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,000
It's dark in here!

894
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,200
- No coins please!"
- Oh stop it!

895
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
- You don't think that's funny?
- No.

896
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:22,200
- You're gay.
- No.

897
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:25,000
Gay, gay, gay!
You are gay!

898
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:28,700
- I have a wife and 3 kids!
- Oh! Good cover

899
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,700
You know what the gay folks
need that they don't have?

900
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:35,100
- A superhero.
- A gay superhero?

901
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,700
Gayman!

902
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,700
"Hi!"

903
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:43,200
"Here I come to save the day!"

904
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,800
"And I look fabulous!"

905
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,900
And when he flies,
his butt whistles...

906
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,800
"Look it's Gayman!"

907
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:06,500
- "Don't turn your back on him!"
- Oh stop it!

908
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,200
Unless you have the lotion...

909
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:13,600
You guys, you've been a great audience!

One for you,

920
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:09,500
And then one for my lady friend and
then another one for my other lady right here.

921
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,500
