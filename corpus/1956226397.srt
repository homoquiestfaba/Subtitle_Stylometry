1
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,095
Aah!

2
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,197
It's love, isn't it?

3
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,781
Sometimes you walk into a house

4
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,784
and you take one look
around, and you know.

5
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,286
And you say, "This is for me."

6
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,288
Oh, I think it's perfect.

7
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,708
It's just what we've
been looking for.

8
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,293
There aren't enough plugs.

9
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:12,753
Hey, wait, Mr. Coleman, now.

10
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,880
That place I showed
you on Sycamore Street

11
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,299
was absolutely, positively
loaded with plugs.

12
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,301
That's right. There were plenty.

13
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,761
But the steps were too high.

14
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,304
When we get older,
we could trip.

15
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,682
Every house we look at you
find something to pick at.

16
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,392
I just know what I like.

17
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,895
Would you like a divorce?
'Cause I'll bring it.

18
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,606
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
No need for that.

19
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,900
I'm gonna find
this house for you.

20
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,402
I am committed to finding
the perfect house for you.

21
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,820
I don't care how long it takes.

22
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:40,697
Because at Evers & Evers,

23
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,701
we want you to be happy
forevers and evers.

24
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,704
Oh, excuse me one second.
Let me take this call.

25
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,289
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

26
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,135
Hello. Evers & Evers Real Estate.
Jim Evers.

27
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:55,087
Hey, honey. How's it going?
Do they like the house?

28
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,089
Yes, this house is
still available.

29
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,298
Oh, I knew it.

30
00:04:58,382 --> 00:04:59,800
I told you they
were lookie-lous.

31
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,718
It's another interested party.

32
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,304
Listen, I'm on my way home
to get ready for dinner.

33
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:05,806
I'm looking forward to tonight.

34
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,391
Well, are you preapproved?

35
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,394
Yeah, the reservation's
at 7:00, so don't be late.

36
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,271
Okay. Well, 7:00 is perfect.

37
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,315
Let's get together at 7:00,
and we'll go over your offer.

38
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,900
Okay, honey. I'll see you later.

39
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:17,901
See what you did?

40
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,195
We love the house.

41
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,990
We do. We love it.

42
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,241
Well, then, Mrs. Coleman.

43
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:26,285
Taking that into consideration,

44
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,287
there's only one
thing left to do.

45
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,081
Let's sign some papers.

46
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:34,418
- Hey.
- Hey.

47
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,711
Lorraine and Gary.

48
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,504
Just like I promised,
here's the offer.

49
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,298
Signed, sealed, and delivered.

50
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,592
Thank you. Thank you so much.

51
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:43,177
We are so grateful.

52
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,888
This is a cause for celebration.
Let us buy you a drink.

53
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,390
Oh, no, really, I can't.
My wife's waiting for me.

54
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,809
This is such a big deal for us.
We have to celebrate.

55
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:52,686
- I really can't. I'm late.
- We insist.

56
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,355
Please.

57
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,608
Okay. One quick drink.
Okay. One quick one.

58
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,693
Sir, can I have a ginger
ale over here, please?

59
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:01,486
Oh, no. That's not a drink.

60
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,946
Sammy, three Volcanoes.

61
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,490
- Oh, no. No volcanoes.
- They're incredibly smooth.

62
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,575
Oh, we love it here.

63
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,118
We've been coming
here for years.

64
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,620
- It's like Hawaii.
- Yes.

65
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,996
We spent our honeymoon there.

66
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,706
It was fantastic. Have you been?

67
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,630
- No, never been there.
- Promise me you'll go.

68
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:15,417
Promise.

69
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:18,295
I'll go if you sign. I will
go to Hawaii if you sign.

70
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,215
But I got to get going because
it's my anniversary tonight.

71
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,218
Your anniversary?
Happy anniversary!

72
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,887
Thank you. Sign that thing here.

Okay, Jim.

79
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,608
- Sorry about that.
- No.

80
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:43,612
It's been a pleasure doing
business with you. Aloha.

81
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,489
Okay. Bye-bye.

82
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,283
Oh, excuse me. Did I
hear you correctly?

83
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,701
Did you just sell their house?

84
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:50,911
I sure did.

85
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,205
'Cause we're looking to buy.

86
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:59,586
Honey, forgive me.

87
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,090
Well, I'm Jim Evers of
Evers & Evers Real Estate.

88
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,716
Tell me about your dream house.

89
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:08,679
Hi, Sara. My name's Teddy.

90
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:11,005
Your husband told me to tell
you he loves you very much,

91
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:13,183
but sometimes he loses
track of the time.

92
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,018
I'm sorry I'm late.

93
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,187
Happy anniversary.

94
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:18,814
Happy anniversary.

95
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,108
Yes.

96
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,194
Look at what he brought you.

97
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,071
Look at that. Isn't that pretty?

98
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,115
Oh, you know, you have
a wonderful husband

99
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,409
that thinks about you like
that on your anniversaries.

100
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,493
You're so fortunate!

101
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,495
It's beautiful.

102
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,082
It's actually Teddy's
fault that I'm late.

103
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,042
He had a little accident
in the backseat,

104
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,879
cotton all over the place,
but I cleaned it up.

105
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,590
It's okay. I forgive Teddy.

106
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,592
Hey, come on, Sara.
Don't be like that.

107
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:49,803
I'm on a roll here. We sold
seven houses this month.

108
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,346
What about the
three soccer games,

109
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,183
two birthday parties,
and barbecue you missed?

110
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,602
Did I miss that much
stuff this month?

111
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,813
Okay. We're gonna
take off this weekend.

112
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:00,647
What?

113
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,816
We're gonna take off
and go down to the lake

114
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,819
like we did last year with the
kids for the whole weekend.

115
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:08,113
- How's that sound?
- Can we really close on this?

116
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,990
Yes. How about this?
We can close on this.

117
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,617
How about this?

118
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:14,119
Close on that. Let
me go tell the kids.

119
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,954
All right? Okay. All right.

120
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,582
Megan and Michael,
big family adventure!

121
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,709
Hey! Michael Jordan Evers!

122
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,002
Aah! Aah!

123
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,712
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

124
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,215
- Dad! There's a...
- What is it?

125
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,178
- There's a spider in my room!
- There's a what?

126
00:08:28,202 --> 00:08:30,010
There's a spider in
my room on the window.

127
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:32,012
Why don't you kill it, man?

128
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,972
That's a big spider!

129
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,599
Come on. It's just
a spider, Michael.

130
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,601
How big could it be?
What is this?

131
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,770
Where's the spider at?

132
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,897
What? Man, you're
acting like it's Mothra.

133
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:42,981
It's just a spider.

134
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,484
You're making a big deal
out of nothing, Michael.

135
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:46,568
You're 10 years old.

136
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,987
It's time I teach you how to
kill a spider the right way.

137
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,657
The most efficient
way to crush a spider.

138
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,117
You got to get a good magazine.
Doesn't matter what you use.

139
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,996
Some people like to use
"Life" or "Time" or...

140
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,917
This is my "Sports
lllustrated" Swimsuit Edition.

141
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,919
What are you doing with it?

142
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,213
- I don't know.
- Yeah, right.

143
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:08,507
If you can look at this, you
should have enough courage

144
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,050
to kill a spider the right way.

145
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:12,636
So I'm gonna roll this up so
you get a good grip on it.

146
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:15,180
You get a bead on the spider.
You get a side swing.

147
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,466
That's where you can really
get some good action going.

148
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,893
You want to come across like
that so you really crush it.

149
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,813
You come across this way so
you get his whole escape route

150
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:23,939
in case he try to go...

151
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,607
You take it, and you whack it.

152
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,401
Go on. Whack the spider.

153
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,902
I don't want to whack it.

154
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:31,196
Come on, you got to whack
the spider, Mike. Whack it.

155
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,116
Dad, I'm afraid of spiders.
I can't whack it.

156
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,119
Let me explain something to you.

157
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:40,581
All your life you're gonna
be facing spiders, okay?

158
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:41,540
I am?

159
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:45,085
What I'm trying to say is
you should never be afraid.

160
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,879
People know, they
use that against you.

161
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,885
I'm not scared of anything.
I'm your dad, right?

162
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:50,799
You're my son. You
whack that spider.

163
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,259
I can't whack the spider, Dad.

164
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,845
Come on. Whack it. You can do it.
Whack the spider.

165
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:57,389
- I don't want to whack it.
- Yes, you can. Come on.

166
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,141
Kill the spider.
Kill the spider.

167
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:01,393
Dad, I can't crush it.
I can't whack it!

168
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:03,812
Hey.

169
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:05,189
There. Happy?

170
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:06,815
No, I'm not happy, Megan.

171
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,192
I was trying to make a point

172
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,903
about how it's important
to whack your own spiders!

173
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,905
Whatever.

174
00:10:13,257 --> 00:10:14,257
Mm-hmm.

175
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,783
Past the Old Miller Road.

176
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:17,910
Okay. Great.

177
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:20,704
It is an old home, Ms. Evers.

178
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:24,082
And my employer is
anxious to move on.

179
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,294
Would it be possible
for you to come alone

180
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,087
to discuss the situation?

181
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:30,964
But my husband and
I work as a team.

182
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:34,384
The master usually
does not take visitors.

183
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,512
However, from your photograph,

184
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:39,598
he thought you to have
a trustworthy face.

185
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:43,393
About your husband,
he felt differently.

186
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,687
Oh. You got our flyer.

187
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,107
The master had wished to
meet you tomorrow evening.

188
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:50,192
Oh, I'm so sorry.

189
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:53,278
But tomorrow I've got
plans that can't be broken.

190
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,404
Who is that?

191
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:55,889
- Excuse me a second.
- Who is that?

192
00:10:55,913 --> 00:10:58,116
Just someone calling
about repping a house.

193
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,410
What's the address? Where is it?

194
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,164
Sara, do you know
where this place is?

195
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:06,500
The places up here are big
multimillion-dollar mansions.

196
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,709
This could be big.

197
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:10,379
And what about our
big family adventure?

198
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,382
It's just a little detour.

199
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,175
How long is it gonna take?

200
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,219
No more than 20 minutes.
20 minutes tops.

201
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:18,846
You kids should be excited.

202
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,181
You're gonna see Mommy and
Daddy in real-estate action.

203
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:25,102
Somebody's calling me.
Who's calling me?

204
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,188
Hello. Jim Evers, Evers
& Evers Real Estate.

205
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,692
Stan, how you doing?
What's the latest?

206
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,695
Really? The Selmer property?

207
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,113
Tomorrow?

208
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,199
Wow. I'm kind of out
of town right now.

209
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:42,995
Hey. But, hey, listen. Maybe
I could come back early.

210
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,414
Oh, no. I can't come back early.

211
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:46,915
No, I can't come back early.

212
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:48,919
Maybe we should just take
care of this on Monday.

213
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,002
All right?

214
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,086
Monday?

215
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,713
Monday sounds fantastic.

216
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,506
Okay. I'll talk
to you on Monday.

217
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,383
We're gonna talk on Monday.

218
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,097
Are we still in America?

219
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:07,519
Here it is, right here.
Okay? All right?

220
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:21,200
Yeah, that's a
whole lot of gate.

221
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,994
They must have a big
possum problem down here.

222
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:25,704
That's some big possum.

223
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,075
Didn't they know we were coming?

224
00:12:35,099 --> 00:12:36,006
Of course they knew.

225
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,384
Maybe there's a call
box or something.

226
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,221
Hello?!

227
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:46,183
Hello! The Evers are here!

228
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,688
Yes, we're here now!

229
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,359
Nobody's answering.

230
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,695
Now I got to get out in the
dirt with my brand-new shoes on.

231
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:14,711
Wow.

232
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,590
How are we gonna get in?

233
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,219
What if you give me a boost,
and I'll go around the back?

234
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,943
They're probably old.
We'll surprise them.

235
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:25,097
You'll probably kill them.

236
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,516
Let's just go.
It's getting late.

237
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,977
You know, Sara, you
give up too easy.

238
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:33,397
You got to be more patient.
The Evers way is to be patient.

239
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:43,907
All right. We're in business.

240
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,909
Let's go, let's go.

241
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,786
Let's do this.

242
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,617
Wow.

243
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,204
Bob Vila would have a
field day with this place.

244
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,414
Hey, Megan, don't slam
the door like that.

245
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,208
It's very sensitive.

246
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,709
It's a car, Dad.

247
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,920
Ah! It's not just a car.

248
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,005
It's a very delicate
piece of machinery.

249
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,382
Shh. She didn't mean
what she just said.

250
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:44,051
She didn't mean that.

251
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,802
Come on. Let's see
what's around back.

252
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:47,596
I'm getting hungry.

253
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:48,638
Me too.

254
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,390
Don't worry. We'll
be 20 minutes tops.

255
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,059
Hey, Dad, when we
get to the lake,

256
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,811
can I go to that pizza shop
where I ate that whole pizza,

257
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,104
and when we got to the cabin,

258
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:59,107
I threw up and you still saw
the pepperoni chunks in it?

259
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:02,486
Yeah, we can go there if we
can avoid a repeat performance.

260
00:15:06,592 --> 00:15:07,592
Wow.

261
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,785
Now, that's something
you don't see every day.

262
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,497
Oh, my God.

263
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,706
Dead people?

264
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,208
Hey, honey.

265
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:20,087
You know they have, uh,
dead people in the backyard?

266
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:22,548
Well, some people have pools.

267
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,300
Some people have private cemeteries.
It happens.

268
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,886
You're gonna sell
a house with this?

269
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,889
This historical sprawling manor
with spacious grounds? Yes.

270
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,183
Hey, that's good. We'll
put that on the listing.

271
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,018
And leave out all
the dead people?

272
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,688
We'll just stick
to the bright side.

273
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:40,691
Oh, no. I got my good suit on.

274
00:15:46,257 --> 00:15:47,257
Oh.

275
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:48,448
You think it's gonna stop?

276
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,118
Oh, I hope it's not
raining at the lake.

277
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,787
When you're at work
with Mommy and Daddy,

278
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:55,998
you're always on your
best behavior, right?

279
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:57,875
Okay. Whoo!

280
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,793
Look at the size
of these knockers.

281
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,879
Ever see anything
like that before?

282
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:05,215
Hello?! Evers Real Estate!

283
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:10,220
Evers Real Estate!

284
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:24,193
Hello?

285
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,112
Is anybody home?

286
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,910
Hello?

287
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:36,705
We're the Evers from
Evers & Evers Real Estate.

288
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,000
Hi!

289
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,716
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

290
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:48,800
Never.

291
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:52,095
Sara, this puts us in
a whole new league.

292
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:55,015
Smells like Grandma's house.

293
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:57,100
Worse. Smells like Grandma.

294
00:16:57,174 --> 00:16:58,495
This place is just
a little dusty.

295
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,839
We'll get a cleaning crew to
come out here and shine it up.

296
00:17:00,863 --> 00:17:04,483
This place would be
sparkling from top to bottom.

297
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:07,903
Mom, this place has spiders.

298
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:31,009
Sara Evers.

299
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,886
Yes, I'm Sara.

300
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:36,515
My name is Ramsley.

301
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:41,520
Hello, Ramsley.

302
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:44,314
I'm Jim Evers of Evers
& Evers Real Estate

303
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:46,400
at your service.

304
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:51,280
We were not expecting... others.

305
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:54,616
Yes, we were on our
way out of town.

306
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,785
Yeah, then when we
realized the enormity

307
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,912
and complexity of
your unique estate,

308
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,706
we wanted to commit
the full resources

309
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,207
of Evers & Evers Real Estate.

310
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,210
At Evers & Evers, we want you
to be happy forevers and evers.

311
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:07,212
Please accept this
waterproof calendar

312
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,882
as a token of our appreciation.

313
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:14,720
Very well.

314
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:17,806
We shall have to
place other settings.

315
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:19,266
Who do you have
the settings for?

316
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:24,479
Master Gracey wishes to discuss
his affairs over dinner.

317
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:26,815
Oh, I'm afraid we have plans.

318
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:28,483
Honey, we can't stay for dinner.

319
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:30,210
Oh, yes. But we mustn't
be rude, darling.

320
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:31,904
What about our family adventure?

321
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:32,863
Yeah, Dad.

322
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:35,407
We'll just have some soup, and
then we'll get going, okay?

323
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:36,783
All right?

324
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,210
Wow.

325
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,890
Wow.

326
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:04,102
Nice. Very nice.

327
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:06,396
Good job. Good job.

328
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,483
Hey, Megan, how'd you like to
eat like this every day at home?

329
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:15,280
The master will be
with you shortly.

330
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,700
Carry on.

331
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:26,917
I said, "Carry
on." He walks off.

332
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,798
Have you ever seen a
fireplace this amazing?

333
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:35,008
Incredible.

334
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:38,595
Ah, we could have one heck of a
wienie roast in that thing, huh?

335
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,181
Seriously. Look at this detail.

336
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:42,808
I've never seen
anything like this.

337
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:46,311
- Haven't you?

338
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:50,607
My grandfather spared no expense
when he built this mansion.

339
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:53,986
Well, your grandfather had
really good taste in tchotchkes.

340
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,791
I'm Jim Evers of Evers
& Evers Real Estate.

341
00:19:55,815 --> 00:19:57,781
Charmed to make your
acquaintance, sir.

342
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,701
Edward. Edward Gracey.

343
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,042
Uh, this is my wife, Sara.

344
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:11,295
You want to come
meet Mr. Gracey?

345
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,505
Very nice to meet
you, Mr. Gracey.

346
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:17,217
And this is our daughter,
Megan, and our son, Michael.

347
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:25,017
You have very beautiful children, Ms.
Evers.

348
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,895
I kicked in some
chromosomes, too.

349
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:32,316
Children. Madam.

350
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,693
Oh. Nice.

351
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,486
Okay.

352
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:41,491
Thank you.

353
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:43,243
The master was very pleased

354
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:46,705
when he heard you could
come on such short notice.

355
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:50,501
Normally we would not have
called you here so abruptly.

356
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:52,503
But we had no other choice.

357
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:54,463
What do you got,
termites or something?

358
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:58,050
Big house like this must
have a lot of termites.

359
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:01,595
No. But lately there have been more...
disturbances.

360
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:05,182
What do you think of the house, Ms.
Evers?

361
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,392
Oh.

362
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:09,811
I think it's
absolutely incredible.

363
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:11,772
The Italian influence.

364
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,482
The Renaissance
style of the molding.

365
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:16,109
The attention to
detail is stunning.

366
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:19,488
You never see houses like this.
Or at least I don't.

367
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:23,992
Great care and love went into
the building of this mansion.

368
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:40,592
This house is my inheritance.

369
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,594
My birthright.

370
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:46,098
But lately it's become
too much to bear.

371
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:49,268
Tell me, Mr. Evers.

372
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,104
Do you believe in ghosts?

373
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,897
Ghosts?

374
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:56,650
Yeah. Sure. I believe in ghosts.
Yeah.

375
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:59,319
I don't think it's a good idea
to put that on the listing.

376
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:01,464
You should talk about how many
bathrooms are in the house.

377
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:02,406
People love bathrooms.

378
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:05,117
We should play up the toilet
angle and leave out ghosts.

379
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,785
I think that'd be best.

380
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:10,914
The storm has swollen the river.

381
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:11,790
How's that?

382
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:15,210
The storm has flooded the road.

383
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,215
I'm afraid there will be no
leaving the mansion tonight.

384
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:21,800
What?

385
00:22:21,884 --> 00:22:27,806
Of course you are all more than
welcome to spend the night here.

386
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:29,683
Oh, no. I really
don't think we should.

387
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:31,685
We've got plans.

388
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:35,606
I'm afraid there's no other way.

389
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:39,109
Ramsley will show
you to your rooms.

390
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:57,419
I believe the children will
be comfortable in this room.

391
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,089
Yeah. Real homey.

392
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:03,300
You'll be fine.

393
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:05,886
Wow. Hey, listen.

394
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:08,680
When you flush the toilet, check
and see how quickly it refills.

395
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:09,806
Good night, Dad.

396
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,391
Good night.

397
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:21,193
I hope you and the madame will
find this room to your liking.

398
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:22,402
Yeah. It's great.

399
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:24,613
It'll be like spending
the night in a fine hotel.

400
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:27,407
Will there be anything
else that you require, sir?

401
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:29,201
Are you gonna get
us some chocolates?

402
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:29,993
Pardon?

403
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:32,559
You know, the little chocolates
they put on the hotel pillows.

404
00:23:32,684 --> 00:23:34,478
Sometimes they have
chocolates on the pillow.

405
00:23:34,561 --> 00:23:36,708
They have little chocolates
on the pillows...

406
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:38,502
to have.

407
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,380
What's the problem?

408
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:46,677
In the first place,

409
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:48,303
we weren't even
supposed to be here.

410
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:49,888
We were supposed
to be at the lake.

411
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:52,307
What am I supposed to do,
control the weather now, Sara?

412
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:53,475
That's not the point.

413
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:55,811
You couldn't resist.
You just had to come.

414
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:58,814
Excuse me. This is a big
opportunity for all of us.

415
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:00,816
Not for us, for you.

416
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:03,610
The only thing you seem to
care about anymore is work.

417
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:05,612
Oh, but when I'm working
hard, it doesn't matter

418
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:08,282
as long as I'm bringing you
home expensive gifts, right?

419
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:12,953
Hey, what are you... Hey, Sara.

420
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:15,080
Hey, Sara, I didn't
mean to say that, okay?

421
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:16,456
Sara.

422
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:17,708
Come on. Stop it.

423
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,459
Sara. Sara.

424
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:23,088
I'm sorry about that, honey.
Can you open up, please?

425
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:29,386
Aah! Ooh.

426
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:30,512
You scared me.

427
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:33,307
- Pardon the intrusion, sir.
- Yes.

428
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,185
The master was wondering if
he might have a word with you

429
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:37,311
in the library.

430
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:39,605
A word? Okay. I'd love
to have a word with him.

431
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,398
Sure. Let's go talk some turkey.

432
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,609
Yes. Turkey.

433
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:45,194
- Very good, sir.
- Yeah.

434
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:47,905
If you will kindly follow me.

435
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:49,028
Yeah. Of course. Of course.

436
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:51,909
Hey, Sara, I'm gonna have
a word with Mr. Gracey.

437
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:53,911
I'll be back in a minute.

438
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:57,247
Ramsley, I was just wondering.

439
00:24:57,289 --> 00:24:58,916
Have you ever been
to a tanning salon?

440
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:00,920
I've got a friend who's
got a really great place.

441
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:02,503
You can get a really smooth tan.

442
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:05,589
Do something about
that ashy white look.

443
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:07,508
I'm sure the ladies
would love it.

444
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:10,594
Yes. Sounds wonderful.

445
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:16,183
Would you care for a drink,
sir, while you're waiting?

446
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:18,894
Yeah. Don't mind if I do.
Thank you, Ramsley.

447
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,979
Oh, wow!

448
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:23,607
Now, that's class.
That's what I need to do.

449
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,109
Get a big picture of myself to
put on the living room wall.

450
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:28,403
Adds a touch of
elegance to the room.

451
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:32,366
Yes, sir. Very elegant.

452
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:34,910
Thank you. Thank you
so much, Ramsley.

453
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:38,872
Mmm.

454
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:40,499
So, Ramsley, how long
you been a butler?

455
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:42,209
A long time.

456
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,002
What are the most
important qualifications

457
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:47,214
in case I might be
doing some interviewing?

458
00:25:47,256 --> 00:25:49,800
Attending to every detail.

459
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:52,177
Understanding priorities.

460
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:56,890
And above all,
knowing one's place.

461
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:59,518
What does your boss like to do?
What's he into?

462
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:02,020
You know, what floats his boat?

463
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:06,900
The master likes a
great many things.

464
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:11,613
Art, literature, beauty.

465
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:13,490
And all that stuff about ghosts.

466
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:16,410
Did he get, like, a bad clam
in his jambalaya one night?

467
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:19,413
You don't believe
in ghosts, sir?

468
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:21,874
Absolutely not. Let
me tell you something.

469
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:24,418
The way I see it, you only
go around the track once.

470
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:27,880
So you do it full-out
all the way around.

471
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:32,092
Mr. Evers, may I confide in you?

472
00:26:32,778 --> 00:26:33,778
Please do.

473
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:35,804
The master is not well.

474
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:38,307
He must leave this
house, Mr. Evers.

475
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:40,142
He must move on.

476
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:43,896
It is of the gravest
importance, I assure you.

477
00:26:44,021 --> 00:26:48,317
Or I fear the very worst.

478
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:52,196
I can't believe this.

479
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,989
Still no reception.

480
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:56,617
We had to take
that little detour.

481
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:58,744
20 minutes tops. Yeah, right.

482
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:01,371
Do you think it's gonna
stop raining soon?

483
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:03,999
How should I know? I'm
not the weatherman.

484
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,585
Hmm.

485
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:09,796
Stogies.

486
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:12,090
Not bad.

487
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:15,010
Not at all. Hold onto that.

488
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:19,806
Hmm. Hmm.

489
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,016
Wonderful.

490
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:24,811
Must be nice. Must
be really nice.

491
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:26,480
I tell ya.

492
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:28,315
Ahh.

493
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:31,401
Hmm.

494
00:27:34,613 --> 00:27:36,240
Hello there, good man.

495
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:37,741
Ramsley, fix the
gentleman a drink.

496
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:40,285
Nigel, I just recently
returned from the Continent,

497
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,995
where I found the
most interesting book.

498
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:44,414
Yes, it was called
"Raising the Dead."

499
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:46,416
Oh! Oh, cripes.

500
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,503
Oh. I hope that doesn't stain.

501
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:51,713
Oh.

502
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,517
Wow.

503
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:20,200
Interesting.

504
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,584
Wow.

505
00:28:36,008 --> 00:28:38,302
Wow. I wonder where
this leads to.

506
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:41,597
Hey!

507
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,682
Hey, open this back up!

508
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:46,101
Hey, open up!

509
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:47,185
Ramsley!

510
00:28:48,312 --> 00:28:50,105
Ramsley!

511
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:52,316
Push back the head!

512
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:55,694
Hey, will somebody
push the head back?

513
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:30,687
Megan!

514
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:38,612
What do you think it is?

515
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:44,618
It's a ghost ball.

516
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:03,095
I think it wants
us to follow it.

517
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:06,682
I think you're crazy.

518
00:30:13,397 --> 00:30:16,483
It does. It wants
us to follow it.

519
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,500
Hey, Megan, wait up!

520
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:43,010
Where's that scary
albino when you need him?

521
00:30:49,308 --> 00:30:51,393
Oh. Hello.

522
00:30:52,603 --> 00:30:55,189
Have you seen my husband?

523
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,320
Excuse me.

524
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:03,989
Wait!

525
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,491
Wait!

526
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:27,221
Oh, Ramsley. It's you.

527
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:28,597
May I help you?

528
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:29,681
Yes.

529
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:31,683
I was just looking
for my husband.

530
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:33,852
Ah, indeed.

531
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:36,605
I left him in the library.

532
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:39,191
Right through there.

533
00:31:41,318 --> 00:31:44,613
Honey, it's late. Let's
not fight anymore.

534
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:46,573
Come to bed?

535
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:48,492
Oh! I'm sorry.

536
00:31:48,617 --> 00:31:49,993
I thought you were my husband.

537
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:51,245
Can I help you with that?

538
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:53,914
Ramsley hates it when I
leave things lying about.

539
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:56,250
Yes. He seems a bit proper.

540
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:58,502
He strikes most people that way.

541
00:31:58,585 --> 00:32:01,296
Once you get to know him,
you'll find that's not the case.

542
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:03,715
But he's really...

543
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:07,719
He's really very sweet.

544
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:09,346
Thank you.

545
00:32:09,388 --> 00:32:11,306
He's been like a father to me.

546
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:15,185
Mr. Gracey, may I
ask you something?

547
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,188
Yes. Of course. Anything.

548
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:19,398
This house.

549
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:21,817
It's been in your
family for generations.

550
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:24,319
It's your home.

551
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:26,780
Why do you want to sell it?

552
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:32,995
These walls are filled
with so many memories.

553
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:37,291
Some of them painful.

554
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:44,214
I think for you to understand,
I really must show you.

555
00:32:45,716 --> 00:32:49,303
It's all right. There's
nothing to be afraid of.

556
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:54,099
Although it might be
a bit worn and faded

557
00:32:54,183 --> 00:32:55,893
from its original grandeur,

558
00:32:56,018 --> 00:32:59,104
this house was once filled
with so many things.

559
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:00,689
So much life.

560
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:06,612
With grand parties, dancing,
laughter, and, above all, hope.

561
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:09,406
Being a Gracey meant that
you were denied nothing.

562
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,200
The world was yours.

563
00:33:11,283 --> 00:33:14,203
What happened here, Mr. Gracey?

564
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:15,287
She did.

565
00:33:15,412 --> 00:33:17,414
Who?

566
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:19,249
Elizabeth.

567
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:23,212
Hers is the story that
haunts these walls.

568
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:49,988
Come on.

569
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:52,199
Megan, wait.

570
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:55,536
You don't know the last time
that thing's been inspected.

571
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:58,789
Would you just relax? Where's
your sense of adventure?

572
00:34:09,883 --> 00:34:12,094
This is against all
my better judgment.

573
00:34:45,586 --> 00:34:47,504
Hi!

574
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:54,011
Is anyone home?

575
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:16,491
Those must be termites.

576
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:20,579
Some big-ass termites.
That's all.

577
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:21,098
Hello?

578
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:38,407
- Oh!

579
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:39,616
Oh.

580
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:44,079
Aah! Aah!

581
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:16,904
Megan!

582
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:25,412
Mom.

583
00:37:25,495 --> 00:37:27,789
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here!

584
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:30,417
This is unspeakable! Unspeakable!
You have to leave!

585
00:37:30,501 --> 00:37:33,212
- Who is that?
- That's none of your business.

586
00:37:33,295 --> 00:37:35,589
Now, come on. Get out of here.
It's way past your bedtime.

587
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:36,882
Her name was Elizabeth.

588
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:39,218
Are you kids hungry? Does
anybody want a cookie?

589
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:40,594
Cookies?!

590
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:43,180
Don't offer them cookies!
They're trespassers!

591
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:45,390
Trespassers don't get cookies!

592
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:47,017
This is none of their concern.

593
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,894
It is their concern!
They're involved!

594
00:37:51,188 --> 00:37:53,190
Hide! Hide!

595
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:07,996
The children are
not in their room.

596
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,456
Have you seen them?

597
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:11,291
Children? What children?

598
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:13,919
What children?

599
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:21,385
Her children.

600
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:24,888
The children she wasn't
supposed to bring.

601
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:28,684
Along with that brainless
husband of hers.

602
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:31,019
Thank you.

603
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:40,612
If I had to listen
to another word

604
00:38:40,696 --> 00:38:44,199
from that insufferable fool,
I think I would have burst.

605
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:47,286
Of course, sir. What a fool!

606
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:49,538
Did I not tell
her to come alone?

607
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:52,708
Is it really too much to ask
for a little cooperation?

608
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:53,792
A little order?

609
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:56,086
Of course not, sir.

610
00:38:56,211 --> 00:39:00,299
If you find the children,
bring them to me.

611
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:01,800
- Certainly, sir.
- Yes, sir.

612
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:04,678
The final arrangements
have been made.

613
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,390
Nothing further will interfere
with the master's plan.

614
00:39:18,817 --> 00:39:22,196
Thank God I heard your voice.
I lost my way.

615
00:39:22,321 --> 00:39:23,722
I don't know how
to get out of here.

616
00:39:23,746 --> 00:39:25,490
I'm sorry if I sound
a little frazzled.

617
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:27,993
I just had myself a little
freak show back there.

618
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:29,870
It's time to respond.

619
00:39:29,912 --> 00:39:31,705
I was supposed to
meet with Mr. Gracey.

620
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:34,166
But I got stuck in the wall.

621
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:37,711
Goblins and ghoulies
from last Halloween,

622
00:39:37,753 --> 00:39:41,215
awaken the spirits
with your tambourine.

623
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:44,092
Okay, I hear you, but I don't see you.
Where are you?

624
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:50,390
I am Madame Leota, seer of
all, voice to the spirits.

625
00:39:50,516 --> 00:39:52,809
Whom do you seek?

626
00:39:55,187 --> 00:39:56,688
Hey! Hey!

627
00:39:56,813 --> 00:39:57,981
Hey, let me out of here!

628
00:39:58,106 --> 00:40:00,484
Silence! Whom do you seek?

629
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:02,402
I am seeking a way out of here.

630
00:40:02,486 --> 00:40:04,112
Then you must look within.

631
00:40:04,196 --> 00:40:06,236
I don't want to look within.
I want to look without.

632
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,699
There is great
evil in this house.

633
00:40:07,783 --> 00:40:09,993
A devil's curse. It
seeks to destroy you.

634
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:12,204
Why would something
seek to destroy me?

635
00:40:12,246 --> 00:40:13,539
I'm just here to sell the house.

636
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:17,000
Dark spirits from the
grave, come forth.

637
00:40:17,084 --> 00:40:20,420
Lift us from the
black and show us.

638
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:22,339
Show us the way back.

639
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:24,216
Dark spirits? Hey,
no dark spirits.

640
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:25,859
Don't you make no
dark spirits come out.

641
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:28,679
Lift us. Lift us
up to the light.

642
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:31,682
And lead us through
this stormy night.

643
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:34,017
Hey, hey, hey. Hey!

644
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:36,186
Hey, I'd really like
to stay on the ground.

645
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:38,511
I'd rather stay on the ground.
Can I stay on the ground?

646
00:40:38,535 --> 00:40:41,483
Evil and darkness have
fallen this night.

647
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:44,903
But now to survive, you
must gain new sight.

648
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:46,613
I must first gain new underwear.

649
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:49,116
Only the light
will lead the way.

650
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:51,493
Follow it and find
your way home.

651
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:54,997
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.

652
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,875
Go, Mr. Evers. Your
family is at stake.

653
00:40:57,916 --> 00:41:01,295
Your very life is at stake.
Break the curse.

654
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,298
There is no escape for you
unless you lift this spell.

655
00:41:04,381 --> 00:41:06,091
Go. Save yourself.

656
00:41:06,216 --> 00:41:07,843
Save your family.

657
00:41:07,885 --> 00:41:10,804
Release her. Release us all!

658
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:13,098
I'm getting so queasy.
I'm getting very queasy.

659
00:41:20,314 --> 00:41:22,191
Oh!

660
00:41:27,613 --> 00:41:31,408
Aah! Aah!

661
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,219
Aah! Aah!

662
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:53,805
Aah!

663
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:00,812
Oh!

664
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,820
- Dad!
- Dad!

665
00:42:08,904 --> 00:42:10,489
Hey! Michael and
Megan, you okay?

666
00:42:10,614 --> 00:42:11,740
We're fine, thanks.

667
00:42:11,782 --> 00:42:13,492
Get your things.
Let's get out of here.

668
00:42:13,617 --> 00:42:14,493
We have a problem.

669
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:16,578
Because of the rain? We're
gonna get a little wet.

670
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,705
Let's just find your
mom and get out of here.

671
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:21,291
I'm afraid that's not possible.
She can't leave.

672
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:22,417
And why not?

673
00:42:22,478 --> 00:42:23,478
Because she can't!

674
00:42:23,502 --> 00:42:27,005
If I could tell you, I would.
But I can't, so I won't, okay?

675
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:28,715
Hey, how'd you...

676
00:42:29,568 --> 00:42:30,568
Hey, look. Come on.

677
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:32,719
Daddy's having more hallucinations.
Let's go.

678
00:42:32,803 --> 00:42:34,596
- They're ghosts, Dad.
- They're not ghosts.

679
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,015
We're just having hallucinations
from that dinner we ate.

680
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:39,184
It was that chicken.
It didn't taste right.

681
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:40,561
- Oh!
- It's not the chicken!

682
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:43,105
All right. It's not the chicken.
But we're getting out of here.

683
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:44,398
But we have to help them.

684
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:47,484
You can't help the dead, honey.
They're beyond help.

685
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:48,861
The man's talking sense.

686
00:42:48,902 --> 00:42:51,405
Everyone should keep their
noses in their own business.

687
00:42:51,488 --> 00:42:53,282
But we have to help
them break the curse.

688
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:55,200
Why is everybody
talking about a curse?

689
00:42:55,284 --> 00:42:57,494
Have you been talking to
that crazy green gypsy

690
00:42:57,619 --> 00:42:58,704
in the giant paperweight?

691
00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:00,414
We've got to go back to see her.

692
00:43:00,497 --> 00:43:02,624
- No back. I'm not going back.
- But, Dad!

693
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:04,793
They had me floating
all around the room.

694
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:06,545
Hey, I was strapped to a chair,

695
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:08,827
floating around the room with
a marching band chasing me.

696
00:43:08,952 --> 00:43:10,792
I'm not going back anywhere!
Forget it, Casper!

697
00:43:10,816 --> 00:43:12,593
But Mom's in trouble.

698
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:14,303
What kind of trouble?

699
00:43:26,899 --> 00:43:31,695
She died here in this house.

700
00:43:31,737 --> 00:43:34,114
She was so very young.

701
00:43:34,198 --> 00:43:37,492
So very beautiful.

702
00:43:37,618 --> 00:43:41,496
She was in love with the
heir to this mansion.

703
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,290
Your grandfather.

704
00:43:43,415 --> 00:43:48,295
And he loved her more
than life itself.

705
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:54,885
But they were from different
worlds and couldn't be together.

706
00:43:57,387 --> 00:44:00,182
How did she die, Mr. Gracey?

707
00:44:00,307 --> 00:44:02,392
She took her own life.

708
00:44:02,518 --> 00:44:04,102
Poison.

709
00:44:04,186 --> 00:44:08,106
After that, his life
became unbearable.

710
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:13,111
And so, without
hope, without love,

711
00:44:13,195 --> 00:44:16,281
without Elizabeth,

712
00:44:16,406 --> 00:44:18,700
he hung himself.

713
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:26,792
His soul wanders these halls,
waiting for her to return.

714
00:44:29,503 --> 00:44:32,381
If you listen carefully,

715
00:44:32,506 --> 00:44:38,679
you can still hear the
beating of his broken heart.

716
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:49,273
Wait a minute. Hold it a second.

717
00:44:49,314 --> 00:44:50,816
You're telling me
this guy is dead

718
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:52,260
and the reason we
were brought here

719
00:44:52,317 --> 00:44:54,194
is he wants to try to
get jiggy with my wife?

720
00:44:54,236 --> 00:44:56,780
Pretty much. Are you upset?

721
00:44:56,905 --> 00:44:59,616
The guy is dead, and he's
trying to get with my wife!

722
00:44:59,658 --> 00:45:01,118
And the house isn't
really for sale!

723
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:03,161
Yes, I'm upset!

724
00:45:03,203 --> 00:45:06,290
Oh, Madame Leota, is it her?

725
00:45:06,415 --> 00:45:10,210
Is she truly our dear, departed
Elizabeth come back to us?

726
00:45:10,252 --> 00:45:13,213
It is true. She
walks these halls.

727
00:45:13,297 --> 00:45:15,299
You see? I told you it is her!

728
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,551
But do not be deceived.

729
00:45:17,593 --> 00:45:20,304
All things are not
as they appear.

730
00:45:20,512 --> 00:45:23,765
For the curse to be lifted,
the truth must be known.

731
00:45:23,807 --> 00:45:27,019
And for the truth to be
known, you must find the key.

732
00:45:27,102 --> 00:45:29,188
What are you talking about, ball lady?
What key?

733
00:45:29,229 --> 00:45:31,815
Enter the tomb under
the great dead oak

734
00:45:31,899 --> 00:45:34,401
and travel down deep
under the ground.

735
00:45:34,484 --> 00:45:37,779
And there you will find
the key that must be found.

736
00:45:37,905 --> 00:45:40,699
Find the black crypt
that bears no name,

737
00:45:40,782 --> 00:45:43,619
or soon your fate
will be the same.

738
00:45:43,702 --> 00:45:45,746
You're telling me all I
have to do is find this key,

739
00:45:45,787 --> 00:45:47,907
then I'm gonna walk out of
here with my wife and kids?

740
00:45:47,931 --> 00:45:50,751
The key is the answer to all.

741
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:52,711
Well, great. I'm in.
Let's get this key.

742
00:45:52,794 --> 00:45:54,588
There's only one problem.

743
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:56,298
How do we get out of here?

744
00:45:56,381 --> 00:45:58,300
Yeah, how do we get out of here?

745
00:45:58,383 --> 00:46:04,014
Well, there's
always, uh, my way.

746
00:46:10,521 --> 00:46:13,524
Hey! I thought you said
you could drive this thing!

747
00:46:13,607 --> 00:46:16,026
Don't you worry. I know
exactly what I'm doing.

748
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,695
- Aah!
- Aah!

749
00:46:21,406 --> 00:46:23,617
Well, you better just keep
your eyes on the road!

750
00:46:23,659 --> 00:46:25,285
- Move over!
- What are you doing?

751
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:27,412
If you keep driving,
you'll kill us all!

752
00:46:27,496 --> 00:46:28,622
That's where you're wrong.

753
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:30,499
Because some of us
are already dead!

754
00:46:36,213 --> 00:46:37,798
Dad, look.

755
00:46:55,232 --> 00:46:58,026
Ready? Fire!

756
00:47:14,186 --> 00:47:15,186
Dad?

757
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:15,961
Yes, son?

758
00:47:16,003 --> 00:47:18,505
I see dead people.

759
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,971
Excuse me.

760
00:47:26,013 --> 00:47:28,307
Why are all these ghosts
still hanging around here?

761
00:47:28,432 --> 00:47:30,726
When they died, they
couldn't find the light.

762
00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:32,269
And now...

763
00:47:32,311 --> 00:47:34,229
Now they're trapped.

764
00:47:34,313 --> 00:47:38,108
Doomed to wander the
Earth for all eternity.

765
00:47:41,904 --> 00:47:44,323
Nice. Nice job.

766
00:47:57,711 --> 00:47:59,421
Whoa!

767
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:02,090
Okay.

768
00:48:02,174 --> 00:48:03,425
Hey!

769
00:48:03,509 --> 00:48:05,302
Hey, what are you doing here?

770
00:48:05,427 --> 00:48:06,929
Can they see us?

771
00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:08,764
No. Of course not.

772
00:48:08,805 --> 00:48:11,725
Yes, I can. I'm looking at you
right now in your stupid hat.

773
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:14,228
Don't listen to him. He's lying.

774
00:48:15,729 --> 00:48:18,815
Whatever. Come on, kids.
Let's go. Come on.

775
00:48:19,608 --> 00:48:23,320
I could swear he was
looking right at me.

776
00:48:23,362 --> 00:48:25,531
He's psychic.

777
00:48:29,701 --> 00:48:32,704
This was to have been
her wedding dress.

778
00:48:32,746 --> 00:48:34,623
Oh, it's lovely.

779
00:48:34,706 --> 00:48:38,710
It would have been lovelier if
she'd had a chance to wear it.

780
00:48:38,794 --> 00:48:42,714
Now it serves only
as a dark reminder

781
00:48:42,798 --> 00:48:44,424
of what could have been.

782
00:48:44,508 --> 00:48:48,303
To love someone so much and
then lose them so suddenly.

783
00:48:48,345 --> 00:48:50,931
I can't imagine how
awful that must be.

784
00:48:51,014 --> 00:48:54,017
If you truly love someone,
they never leave you.

785
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:57,312
They remain in
your heart forever.

786
00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:01,817
Isn't that romantic?

787
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,403
He was willing to throw
everything away for love.

788
00:49:04,528 --> 00:49:07,322
Well, now he's broke, dead, and cursed.
Nice move.

789
00:49:07,406 --> 00:49:09,491
- Oh, crap!

790
00:49:09,533 --> 00:49:10,993
These are my new shoes.

791
00:49:11,076 --> 00:49:12,494
Hey, kids, watch your step.

792
00:49:12,536 --> 00:49:13,829
- Oh, crap!

793
00:49:13,912 --> 00:49:15,289
Hey, Michael, don't say "crap."

794
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:16,707
All right. Where is this place?

795
00:49:16,832 --> 00:49:17,916
Okay, where are we?

796
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,710
I think the gypsy
lady said something

797
00:49:19,835 --> 00:49:21,420
about making a left at an oak.

798
00:49:21,503 --> 00:49:24,798
Okay. Well, glad
she was so specific.

799
00:49:29,803 --> 00:49:32,431
What is that? Do you hear that?

800
00:49:32,514 --> 00:49:34,016

All right, kids. Stay close.

837
00:51:07,401 --> 00:51:08,527
Hey.

838
00:51:14,616 --> 00:51:16,702
Look.

839
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:17,995
It's a warning.

840
00:51:19,121 --> 00:51:20,622
Now, how do you know that?

841
00:51:20,706 --> 00:51:23,208
I studied Latin for
three years, Dad.

842
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:25,002
You thought it was
dumb, remember?

843
00:51:25,127 --> 00:51:26,920
You said it was a dead language.

844
00:51:27,004 --> 00:51:29,923
Oh, we see how wrong
I was about that.

845
00:51:29,965 --> 00:51:33,177
"Beware all who enter.

846
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:37,014
Here lies the
passage to the dead."

847
00:51:37,806 --> 00:51:40,100
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Where are you going?

848
00:51:40,225 --> 00:51:42,686
- I don't like Latin.
- Hey, wait. Michael.

849
00:51:42,728 --> 00:51:45,022
You're 10 years old now. You
got to start being a man.

850
00:51:45,105 --> 00:51:48,108
I just turned 10. I'm
still getting used to it.

851
00:51:51,612 --> 00:51:52,821
Okay. Here's what we do.

852
00:51:52,905 --> 00:51:54,615
Megan, stay here
with your brother.

853
00:51:54,656 --> 00:51:55,324
What?

854
00:51:55,407 --> 00:51:57,826
I'm not gonna leave him
out here by himself.

855
00:51:57,868 --> 00:51:59,203
You guys stay together.

856
00:51:59,328 --> 00:52:01,413
I'll go in here, and
I'll take care of this.

857
00:52:01,455 --> 00:52:03,207
Okay.

858
00:52:03,332 --> 00:52:05,125
All right.

859
00:52:08,712 --> 00:52:10,214
Okay.

860
00:52:17,596 --> 00:52:19,223
Oh.

861
00:52:20,098 --> 00:52:22,601
Wow.

862
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:27,773
Okay.

863
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:29,525
All right.

864
00:52:33,403 --> 00:52:35,989
Okay. I'll be right back.

865
00:52:36,073 --> 00:52:38,617
20 minutes tops, right?

866
00:52:38,659 --> 00:52:41,119
20 minutes tops.

867
00:53:22,494 --> 00:53:25,622
What was it that gypsy
told me to look for?

868
00:53:25,706 --> 00:53:28,709
Look for a crypt with...

869
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:31,003
Look for a crypt...

870
00:53:31,128 --> 00:53:33,130
- A crypt without a name.
- Aah!

871
00:53:33,213 --> 00:53:35,215
Oh! What's the matter with you?

872
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:37,718
You can't just be
popping out like that.

873
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:39,442
I thought I told you
to wait with Michael.

874
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,722
I was worried you
wouldn't find it.

875
00:53:41,805 --> 00:53:44,558
Besides, Michael's fine.

876
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,394
She said, "Find the black
crypt with no name",

877
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:49,521
or soon your fate
will be the same."

878
00:53:56,695 --> 00:53:58,322
That must be it.

879
00:53:58,405 --> 00:54:00,616
Good hunch, Dad.

880
00:54:03,911 --> 00:54:06,121
I'm officially starting
to get sick of this place.

881
00:54:06,205 --> 00:54:08,373
And we're here 'cause of who?

882
00:54:08,415 --> 00:54:11,502
Because I take seriously my
responsibility as breadwinner.

883
00:54:11,627 --> 00:54:13,921
I want you guys to have
everything I never had before.

884
00:54:14,004 --> 00:54:15,797
I didn't know you
had a bad childhood.

885
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:17,216
I didn't have a bad childhood.

886
00:54:17,299 --> 00:54:19,301
Then why do we have to
have what you didn't have?

887
00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:21,053
Because...

888
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:22,429
Hey, don't be tricking me,

889
00:54:22,513 --> 00:54:25,307
you little Latin-speaking
13-year-old.

890
00:54:25,432 --> 00:54:27,601
Let's just get this over with.
Hold this.

891
00:54:27,726 --> 00:54:30,020
Hold it with two hands, now.

892
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,703
Aah! Phew!

893
00:54:48,705 --> 00:54:51,333
Oh, man.

894
00:54:53,502 --> 00:54:55,295
Excuse me one second.

895
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,714
I'm sorry to bother you.

896
00:54:58,924 --> 00:55:00,926
Oh!

897
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:03,428
Aah. Ugh.

898
00:55:03,512 --> 00:55:05,931
Oh, no. Ew.

899
00:55:06,014 --> 00:55:09,226
Aah.

900
00:55:12,729 --> 00:55:14,356
Okay. All right.

901
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:17,025
Now, that wasn't hard, was it?

902
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:18,610
Let's get out of here.

903
00:55:21,405 --> 00:55:23,285
That gypsy had me thinking
it was gonna be hard.

904
00:55:23,323 --> 00:55:25,117
- That was easy.

905
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:30,706
Oh! Oh!

906
00:55:30,831 --> 00:55:32,207
Oh, no.

907
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:35,127
Oh! Oh, no!

908
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:39,798
Go get the key! I'll
take care of him!

909
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,428
Hey, man, go on back to bed.
Get back in your bed.

910
00:55:44,511 --> 00:55:45,721
Go back to bed.

911
00:55:45,804 --> 00:55:47,723
I'm Jim Evers of Evers
& Evers Real Estate.

912
00:55:47,764 --> 00:55:49,600
Hey, look, I don't
want no trouble, man.

913
00:55:49,725 --> 00:55:51,894
The gypsy told me it was all
right to get the key, so -

914
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:53,312
Oh!

915
00:55:54,521 --> 00:55:57,107
Just lighten up. Now, let
me tell you something.

916
00:55:57,232 --> 00:56:00,027
I got to get my wife.
I don't want no trouble.

917
00:56:00,068 --> 00:56:02,029
Seriously, back up!

918
00:56:05,532 --> 00:56:07,326
You asked for it.

919
00:56:11,205 --> 00:56:12,623
Next time you're
gonna think twice

920
00:56:12,706 --> 00:56:15,626
before coming back from
the dead, ain't you?

921
00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:18,212
- Did you get the key?
- I'm looking! I'm looking!

922
00:56:18,295 --> 00:56:20,923
Take your time. Relax. I have
everything under control.

923
00:56:21,006 --> 00:56:23,509
I have everything
completely under control.

924
00:56:28,514 --> 00:56:30,724
Megan, you better look faster!

925
00:56:30,766 --> 00:56:32,935
Oh, I don't want to do this.

926
00:56:41,693 --> 00:56:43,695
Jeez.

927
00:57:09,805 --> 00:57:11,098
Aah!

928
00:57:13,934 --> 00:57:15,394
- Aah!

929
00:57:28,115 --> 00:57:30,033
Give me your hand.

930
00:57:33,912 --> 00:57:36,206
Okay. Come on, come on, come on!

931
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,711
Come on, guys! Hurry up!

932
00:57:40,752 --> 00:57:41,628
Hold on!

933
00:57:41,712 --> 00:57:43,714
Come on, guys! Hurry up!

934
00:57:44,923 --> 00:57:46,717
Michael! Michael, open the door.

935
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,261
Michael, it's locked
from the outside!

936
00:57:49,303 --> 00:57:52,014
Michael, open the door. Open the door.
Michael!

937
00:57:52,097 --> 00:57:54,808
Dad, there's spiders everywhere,
and I don't have a magazine.

938
00:57:54,933 --> 00:57:56,727
- Hey, Michael, are you scared?
- Uh-huh.

939
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:59,813
Michael, it's okay to be scared.
Everybody gets scared sometimes.

940
00:57:59,897 --> 00:58:01,565
- Daddy's scared right now.
- You are?

941
00:58:01,607 --> 00:58:03,901
Yes, I'm very scared. Now,
please open the door, son!

942
00:58:04,026 --> 00:58:06,695
Michael, open the
door, or I'll kill you!

943
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:07,900
That's great. Keep him calm.

944
00:58:07,924 --> 00:58:09,907
Hey, Michael, listen,
it's okay to get scared.

945
00:58:09,948 --> 00:58:11,617
Everybody gets
scared now and then.

946
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:12,993
You just can't let it stop you.

947
00:58:13,035 --> 00:58:14,828
Michael, if you think
you're scared now,

948
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:16,205
wait till the zombies come out!

949
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:17,581
What zombies?

950
00:58:17,623 --> 00:58:19,041
Michael! Hey, Michael, look.

951
00:58:19,082 --> 00:58:20,417
Just open the door. Please, man.

952
00:58:20,501 --> 00:58:21,627
Open the door right now.

953
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:22,794
Dad, they're coming!

954
00:58:24,505 --> 00:58:26,006
Michael, open the
door right now!

955
00:58:26,131 --> 00:58:29,510
Open the door! Open the door!

956
00:58:29,635 --> 00:58:32,513
Open the door right now!
Open the door!

957
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:35,015
Oh!

958
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,021
Aah!

959
00:58:41,813 --> 00:58:44,107
Lock it! Lock it!

960
00:58:44,233 --> 00:58:46,318
Okay. Come on!

961
00:58:46,401 --> 00:58:47,486
All right.

962
00:58:47,528 --> 00:58:49,905
Okay. All right. Get 'em off!

963
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:52,032
Okay. Come on. Get 'em off.
Okay.

964
00:58:52,115 --> 00:58:54,409
All right. We got it. All right.
You okay?

965
00:58:54,535 --> 00:58:55,535
Okay.

966
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:57,621
My brave little man. All right.

967
00:58:57,704 --> 00:58:58,830
All right. You okay?

968
00:58:58,914 --> 00:59:00,916
Yeah. You got the key?

969
00:59:02,626 --> 00:59:04,503
Oh, no.

970
00:59:05,212 --> 00:59:06,713
Wait. Whoa. Yeah, I got it.
I got it.

971
00:59:06,797 --> 00:59:08,799
There it is. Okay.

972
00:59:08,924 --> 00:59:09,800
All right.

973
00:59:09,925 --> 00:59:12,219
Now, we went to hell and
back to get this thing.

974
00:59:12,302 --> 00:59:14,263
Where's the door out of here?

975
00:59:14,304 --> 00:59:16,223
First, you must find the trunk.

976
00:59:16,306 --> 00:59:17,099
Trunk?

977
00:59:17,224 --> 00:59:18,809
Yes, trunk.

978
00:59:18,934 --> 00:59:19,977
Not door?

979
00:59:20,018 --> 00:59:22,813
No. Not door. Trunk.

980
00:59:22,896 --> 00:59:26,233
All you said I had to do was find this key!
I got the key.

981
00:59:26,316 --> 00:59:28,157
Now you're telling me
this story about a trunk!

982
00:59:28,193 --> 00:59:29,778
The key is the answer
to all, remember?

983
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:32,823
Look, I don't make the rules.
I just work here.

984
00:59:32,906 --> 00:59:34,825
Okay. That's it.
That's the last straw.

985
00:59:34,908 --> 00:59:36,702
I've had enough
of this nonsense.

986
00:59:36,827 --> 00:59:39,121
Hey, what are you doing?!
Put me down!

987
00:59:39,204 --> 00:59:41,623
This is bad luck!
This is very bad luck!

988
00:59:41,707 --> 00:59:43,834
I'll show you bad luck. I'm
tired of playing around.

989
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:45,294
I'm getting nauseous!

990
00:59:45,419 --> 00:59:47,212
You'll get over it.

991
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:49,298
Please don't drop me.

992
00:59:49,423 --> 00:59:51,508
I'm fragile. I'm very fragile.

993
00:59:51,633 --> 00:59:53,074
Don't talk to me
about being fragile.

994
00:59:53,098 --> 00:59:55,475
I'm the one that's
feeling fragile right now.

995
00:59:58,993 --> 00:59:59,993
Is that it?

996
01:00:00,017 --> 01:00:01,727
- That's it.
- Hmm. All right.

997
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:03,812
Now we're in business.

998
01:00:04,897 --> 01:00:07,232
Hey, hold her for a second.

999
01:00:10,194 --> 01:00:12,821
All right. Okay.

1000
01:00:12,905 --> 01:00:14,698
Okay.

1001
01:00:28,504 --> 01:00:31,298
How do I know what to look for?
This thing is full of junk.

1002
01:00:31,423 --> 01:00:34,134
Find the thing that must be read

1003
01:00:34,218 --> 01:00:37,012
lest your heart be
filled with dread.

1004
01:00:37,095 --> 01:00:39,431
There's nothing in here red.

1005
01:00:42,518 --> 01:00:45,103
Hey, wait a minute.
There's a letter here.

1006
01:00:45,229 --> 01:00:47,022
It's a letter.

1007
01:00:49,233 --> 01:00:51,818
"Yes, my dear heart,
I will marry you."

1008
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:53,862
I will love you
for all eternity.

1009
01:00:53,904 --> 01:00:56,406
And tonight at last,
we will be together.

1010
01:00:56,448 --> 01:00:57,491
I do.

1011
01:00:57,533 --> 01:01:00,619
"Forever yours, Elizabeth."

1012
01:01:00,702 --> 01:01:02,204
She didn't kill herself.

1013
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:04,289
She wanted to be with him.

1014
01:01:04,331 --> 01:01:06,834
Yeah, and somebody gave
him the wrong letter.

1015
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:09,419
Yes. Well done, Mr. Evers.

1016
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:12,130
I must say I'm impressed.

1017
01:01:12,214 --> 01:01:16,134
You are more persistent than
I would have ever imagined.

1018
01:01:16,176 --> 01:01:19,304
The butler did it? You
got to be kidding me.

1019
01:01:19,429 --> 01:01:23,433
I will deal with you two later.

1020
01:01:25,018 --> 01:01:26,854
Why'd you kill her?

1021
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:29,898
Because the master would
not listen to reason.

1022
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:31,233
He had everything in the world.

1023
01:01:31,316 --> 01:01:35,195
And yet he was willing to
throw it all away for love.

1024
01:01:35,237 --> 01:01:38,824
I did tell him it
would end badly.

1025
01:01:38,907 --> 01:01:40,701
You're a real cold dude.

1026
01:01:40,826 --> 01:01:44,204
No, Mr. Evers.
I am a rational man.

1027
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:46,915
It was my responsibility
to the house.

1028
01:01:46,999 --> 01:01:49,001
My duty, sir, to see to it

1029
01:01:49,126 --> 01:01:53,213
that the boy did not make a
foolish error in judgment.

1030
01:01:53,297 --> 01:01:57,634
Running away with that girl
would have destroyed this house.

1031
01:01:57,676 --> 01:01:59,720
It would have
destroyed everything.

1032
01:01:59,803 --> 01:02:03,515
And I could not stand by and
watch it all fall to ruin.

1033
01:02:03,557 --> 01:02:05,017
Punch his face in, Dad.

1034
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,728
Yeah, but first I'm gonna tell
his master what really happened.

1035
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:09,521
The master must never know.

1036
01:02:09,605 --> 01:02:12,316
Edward and his love
will be reunited,

1037
01:02:12,399 --> 01:02:14,318
and this curse will be broken.

1038
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:15,861
That's not her. That's my wife.

1039
01:02:15,903 --> 01:02:18,530
And what she sees in
you I'll never know.

1040
01:02:18,614 --> 01:02:21,033
But that is of little
importance now.

1041
01:02:21,116 --> 01:02:25,412
The only thing that matters is
that the master's pain must end.

1042
01:02:25,454 --> 01:02:27,706
And it will end tonight.

1043
01:02:27,831 --> 01:02:32,211
The curse will be broken, and
we can all finally move on.

1044
01:02:32,294 --> 01:02:35,005
All right. That's it, man.
Where's my wife?

1045
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,132
Getting ready for her
wedding, of course.

1046
01:02:37,216 --> 01:02:38,509
What wedding? He
can't marry her.

1047
01:02:38,634 --> 01:02:39,927
He's dead, and she's not.

1048
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:41,386
True.

1049
01:02:41,428 --> 01:02:43,889
But that can be
easily corrected.

1050
01:02:43,931 --> 01:02:48,227
Life, I'm afraid, is
such a delicate state.

1051
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:51,730
If you put one finger on my
wife, I swear I'll kill you.

1052
01:02:54,733 --> 01:02:58,403
How wonderful. You're
going to kill a ghost.

1053
01:02:58,445 --> 01:03:00,614
- Leave him alone!
- Stop it!

1054
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:03,909
- Aah!
- Aah!

1055
01:03:04,034 --> 01:03:06,119
Let them go!

1056
01:03:09,706 --> 01:03:12,334
You're gonna let my kids out
of here, take me to my wife,

1057
01:03:12,417 --> 01:03:13,919
and let us out of
here right now!

1058
01:03:14,002 --> 01:03:17,798
You want out, fine.

1059
01:03:17,923 --> 01:03:20,801
Let me show you out.

1060
01:03:24,304 --> 01:03:29,434
Now, for the last time,
good night, Mr. Evers.

1061
01:03:31,103 --> 01:03:33,522
Aah!

1062
01:03:33,605 --> 01:03:35,315
Ugh!

1063
01:03:42,698 --> 01:03:44,700
Oh!

1064
01:04:05,721 --> 01:04:08,015
This house has waited so long

1065
01:04:08,098 --> 01:04:11,894
to have its shroud
of darkness lifted.

1066
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:18,734
And tonight, for the first
time in, oh, so many years,

1067
01:04:18,775 --> 01:04:20,527
I believe it may be possible

1068
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:25,115
that the story will
finally end differently.

1069
01:04:25,157 --> 01:04:26,825
Sara?

1070
01:04:26,909 --> 01:04:30,329
Do you believe that love
is about second chances?

1071
01:04:30,412 --> 01:04:32,831
About forgiveness?

1072
01:04:32,915 --> 01:04:35,626
Yes, I do.

1073
01:04:36,126 --> 01:04:38,128
Don't you remember?

1074
01:04:38,212 --> 01:04:39,671
Remember?

1075
01:04:39,713 --> 01:04:41,215
Mr. Gracey, are you all right?

1076
01:04:41,298 --> 01:04:43,133
Don't you recognize me at all?

1077
01:04:43,217 --> 01:04:44,635
Mr. Gracey.

1078
01:04:44,718 --> 01:04:47,012
I thought certainly bringing
you back to Gracey Manor

1079
01:04:47,095 --> 01:04:48,889
would help you remember.

1080
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:51,308
Remember what? Mr. Gracey,
you're scaring me.

1081
01:04:51,433 --> 01:04:53,227
Where it happened.

1082
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:55,354
Where we spent our
last moments together.

1083
01:04:55,395 --> 01:04:58,899
Where we danced together for
the last time before you...

1084
01:04:58,941 --> 01:05:00,817
Before you killed yourself!

1085
01:05:00,859 --> 01:05:02,694
But now you've returned to me.

1086
01:05:02,819 --> 01:05:05,531
And at long last,
we can be together.

1087
01:05:05,614 --> 01:05:07,115
Why do you not remember?

1088
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:09,159
You were my world, my life!

1089
01:05:09,201 --> 01:05:11,912
And I have loved you in
death as I did in life!

1090
01:05:11,995 --> 01:05:13,664
Let me go!

1091
01:05:13,705 --> 01:05:15,916
Why do you not remember?

1092
01:05:17,918 --> 01:05:19,920
You are her. You are Elizabeth.

1093
01:05:20,003 --> 01:05:21,129
You must be!

1094
01:05:21,213 --> 01:05:23,215
Can you not sense it?
Search your heart.

1095
01:05:23,257 --> 01:05:24,800
I am your one true love.

1096
01:05:24,925 --> 01:05:26,301
And now we can
finally be together.

1097
01:05:26,426 --> 01:05:27,594
Don't you understand?

1098
01:05:28,095 --> 01:05:29,721
Elizabeth, you
must listen to me.

1099
01:05:29,763 --> 01:05:31,181
I'm not Elizabeth!

1100
01:05:31,223 --> 01:05:33,183
Please! I implore you.

1101
01:05:33,225 --> 01:05:35,811
Leave me alone!
Get away from me!

1102
01:05:41,608 --> 01:05:44,528
She doesn't remember.

1103
01:05:44,611 --> 01:05:46,029
It can't be her.

1104
01:05:46,113 --> 01:05:48,365
It is her, sir.

1105
01:05:48,407 --> 01:05:51,702
The gypsy woman
prophesied her return.

1106
01:05:51,827 --> 01:05:54,705
And now the time has come.

1107
01:05:55,414 --> 01:05:56,915
You had best get ready.

1108
01:05:56,999 --> 01:05:58,917
But she doesn't remember.

1109
01:05:59,001 --> 01:06:01,628
In time she will, sir.

1110
01:06:01,712 --> 01:06:05,007
I assure you she will.

1111
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:13,807
Open up! Hey!

1112
01:06:13,932 --> 01:06:15,809
Let me in!

1113
01:06:28,822 --> 01:06:30,908
Aah!

1114
01:06:48,133 --> 01:06:50,511
Oh, Ramsley, you
have to help me.

1115
01:06:50,594 --> 01:06:53,430
There's something horribly wrong.
Mr. Gracey...

1116
01:06:53,472 --> 01:06:56,433
Yes. I know, my dear. I know.

1117
01:06:56,475 --> 01:06:58,018
He's expecting you.

1118
01:06:58,101 --> 01:07:01,813
He's always been expecting you.

1119
01:07:01,897 --> 01:07:04,816
And you haven't put
on your dress yet.

1120
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,402
We can't keep the
master waiting.

1121
01:07:07,528 --> 01:07:09,321
Waiting? For what?

1122
01:07:09,404 --> 01:07:12,699
Why, your wedding, of course.

1123
01:07:12,824 --> 01:07:13,909
My...

1124
01:07:14,535 --> 01:07:16,453
I'm not Elizabeth!

1125
01:07:16,495 --> 01:07:18,330
Of course you are, my dear.

1126
01:07:18,413 --> 01:07:19,915
You may not see it yet.

1127
01:07:19,998 --> 01:07:22,209
But in time you will.

1128
01:07:22,334 --> 01:07:25,420
You don't actually think I'm
going through with this madness?

1129
01:07:25,504 --> 01:07:28,924
Oh, yes. I very much do.

1130
01:07:29,007 --> 01:07:30,717
You see...

1131
01:07:30,801 --> 01:07:33,804
we wouldn't want anything
to happen to the children.

1132
01:07:33,929 --> 01:07:35,806
Now, would we?

1133
01:07:35,931 --> 01:07:37,724
Michael! Megan!

1134
01:07:37,766 --> 01:07:39,518
You wouldn't.

1135
01:07:39,601 --> 01:07:41,603
Of course not, my dear.

1136
01:07:41,728 --> 01:07:43,814
But that is entirely up to you.

1137
01:07:43,897 --> 01:07:50,404
If not, I really do
fear for the children.

1138
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:55,033
Have her ready.

1139
01:07:55,117 --> 01:07:58,704
And this time, any further
acts of insubordination

1140
01:07:58,829 --> 01:08:01,623
will be dealt with in the
harshest possible manner.

1141
01:08:01,707 --> 01:08:03,458
But, sir?

1142
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:06,795
There are worse things
than purgatory, madam.

1143
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,298
I can assure you.

1144
01:08:12,426 --> 01:08:14,595
Have her ready.

1145
01:08:57,221 --> 01:09:00,224
Tears of joy.

1146
01:09:24,206 --> 01:09:26,124
What are you doing?

1147
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:28,460
Hey, you leave me alone.

1148
01:09:28,502 --> 01:09:30,212
Just get out of here
and leave me alone.

1149
01:09:30,295 --> 01:09:30,963
Oh, I see.

1150
01:09:31,004 --> 01:09:34,007
You're just gonna sit there,
feeling sorry for yourself.

1151
01:09:34,132 --> 01:09:35,926
You tell me why not.

1152
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:38,512
This whole thing was my fault.

1153
01:09:38,595 --> 01:09:41,431
We should've never been
here in the first place.

1154
01:09:41,515 --> 01:09:43,183
Supposed to be at the lake.

1155
01:09:43,225 --> 01:09:47,020
We'd be sitting by a
warm fire right now.

1156
01:09:47,062 --> 01:09:49,523
And I made us come here.

1157
01:09:49,606 --> 01:09:52,401
And now it's too late.

1158
01:09:52,526 --> 01:09:55,320
No. It's never too late.

1159
01:09:55,404 --> 01:09:58,198
Hey, look, I tried to get in
there, and I can't, all right?

1160
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,950
I tried! I failed!

1161
01:09:59,992 --> 01:10:03,662
You try. You fail.

1162
01:10:03,704 --> 01:10:07,416
But the only true failure
is when you stop trying.

1163
01:10:07,499 --> 01:10:10,794
What do you want me to do? Huh?

1164
01:10:12,504 --> 01:10:14,715
Try again.

1165
01:10:21,013 --> 01:10:22,014
Hold on!

1166
01:10:22,097 --> 01:10:24,308
With what?

1167
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:32,733
- Aah!
- Aah!

1168
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,030
Elizabeth?

1169
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:44,328
Yes, my love.

1170
01:10:51,126 --> 01:10:52,211
I'll be right back.

1171
01:10:52,294 --> 01:10:55,130
Okay. I'll wait here.

1172
01:10:57,132 --> 01:10:58,592
Dearly beloved,

1173
01:10:58,634 --> 01:11:01,428
we are gathered together
here in the sight of God

1174
01:11:01,512 --> 01:11:04,932
to join this man and this woman
in the bonds of holy matrimony.

1175
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:07,809
Dad! Help us!

1176
01:11:09,895 --> 01:11:12,606
Michael! Megan!

1177
01:11:15,817 --> 01:11:18,320
Wilt thou, Edward Gracey,

1178
01:11:18,403 --> 01:11:20,906
have this woman to
be thy wedded wife,

1179
01:11:21,031 --> 01:11:23,534
to live together
after God's ordinance

1180
01:11:23,617 --> 01:11:25,827
in the holiest
state of matrimony?

1181
01:11:25,869 --> 01:11:27,120
I will.

1182
01:11:31,124 --> 01:11:34,711
And do you, Elizabeth Henshaw,

1183
01:11:34,795 --> 01:11:37,589
take this man to be
your lawful husband,

1184
01:11:37,631 --> 01:11:43,220
to love and cherish in
death as you did in life?

1185
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:44,303
I do.

1186
01:11:44,596 --> 01:11:46,014
Whoa!

1187
01:11:52,312 --> 01:11:54,606
Aah!

1188
01:11:55,023 --> 01:11:59,027
From this day forward, you
shall be joined together as one

1189
01:11:59,111 --> 01:12:03,323
for all eternity until
the very end of time.

1190
01:12:10,914 --> 01:12:16,295
What God has joined together
let no man cast asunder.

1191
01:12:19,923 --> 01:12:21,508
- Dad!
- Dad!

1192
01:12:23,802 --> 01:12:27,014
If anyone has any objections...

1193
01:12:29,016 --> 01:12:31,602
Yeah, I got a few objections!

1194
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:39,693
The next time I say
we're going to the lake,

1195
01:12:39,818 --> 01:12:42,112
- we're going to the lake.
- Let's go.

1196
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:45,115
Get away from her.

1197
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:46,700
I lost her once.

1198
01:12:46,825 --> 01:12:48,952
I don't intend to
let it happen again.

1199
01:12:48,994 --> 01:12:51,622
This is not Elizabeth. Ramsley,
you tell him the truth.

1200
01:12:51,705 --> 01:12:54,708
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1201
01:12:54,833 --> 01:12:55,918
Now you got amnesia, huh?

1202
01:12:56,001 --> 01:12:58,003
Elizabeth didn't kill herself.
He did it.

1203
01:12:58,128 --> 01:12:59,630
He's been lying
to you all along.

1204
01:12:59,713 --> 01:13:02,132
I'm warning you, sir.

1205
01:13:02,216 --> 01:13:03,258
Step away.

1206
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,941
Don't think 'cause you
pull out your sword

1207
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:06,290
I'm gonna let you marry my wife.

1208
01:13:06,314 --> 01:13:08,472
My patience is wearing thin.

1209
01:13:08,514 --> 01:13:10,724
Elizabeth, please, come along.

1210
01:13:10,766 --> 01:13:13,393
I'm not Elizabeth.

1211
01:13:13,519 --> 01:13:14,394
You must be.

1212
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,605
Her name is Sara.
She's from New Jersey.

1213
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:18,371
Ramsley wants you to
think she's Elizabeth

1214
01:13:18,398 --> 01:13:20,317
so this curse would be lifted.

1215
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,528
That is absurd.

1216
01:13:22,611 --> 01:13:24,154
Forgive me.

1217
01:13:24,196 --> 01:13:25,531
If you're gonna
kill me, kill me.

1218
01:13:25,614 --> 01:13:27,115
But on the other side,

1219
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:29,079
I'm gonna be whipping
your ass for all eternity.

1220
01:13:29,103 --> 01:13:31,620
So maybe you should read this
before you stab somebody.

1221
01:13:31,703 --> 01:13:33,830
- What is it?
- It's Elizabeth's letter.

1222
01:13:33,914 --> 01:13:35,415
Her real letter.
The one she wrote.

1223
01:13:35,499 --> 01:13:38,126
The one he stole.
You never saw it.

1224
01:13:46,134 --> 01:13:48,387
What's the meaning of this?

1225
01:13:48,428 --> 01:13:52,724
Must we continue to listen to
the ramblings of a lunatic?

1226
01:13:52,808 --> 01:13:54,518
But it is written in her hand.

1227
01:13:54,601 --> 01:13:57,020
Yeah, it's written in her hand.
Explain that, Ramsley.

1228
01:13:57,104 --> 01:13:58,897
Well?

1229
01:14:03,193 --> 01:14:06,154
Your union was unacceptable.

1230
01:14:06,196 --> 01:14:10,617
I tried to warn you,
but you wouldn't listen.

1231
01:14:10,659 --> 01:14:12,160
So you killed her.

1232
01:14:12,202 --> 01:14:16,206
I told you it would be a mistake
to run away with that girl.

1233
01:14:16,248 --> 01:14:19,626
But I loved her!
Was love my mistake?

1234
01:14:19,668 --> 01:14:21,295
Yes!

1235
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,881
I tried to protect you.

1236
01:14:23,922 --> 01:14:27,801
All these years I've
sacrificed for you.

1237
01:14:27,926 --> 01:14:32,514
But what would you understand
of sacrifice, duty, or honor?

1238
01:14:32,598 --> 01:14:34,516
You loved her.

1239
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,435
Well, damn you.

1240
01:14:36,518 --> 01:14:39,021
Damn you all to hell!

1241
01:14:44,401 --> 01:14:46,528
Aah!

1242
01:15:18,727 --> 01:15:20,729
Aah!

1243
01:15:23,375 --> 01:15:24,375
Aah!

1244
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:26,109
Jim!

1245
01:15:26,151 --> 01:15:27,819
Aah!

1246
01:15:29,821 --> 01:15:32,199
Aah!

1247
01:15:37,204 --> 01:15:39,122
Aah!

1248
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:02,020
- Mom!
- Mom!

1249
01:16:02,104 --> 01:16:03,105
Mom, what's wrong?

1250
01:16:03,230 --> 01:16:04,314
Are you all right?

1251
01:16:04,398 --> 01:16:05,816
- Mom.
- Hey!

1252
01:16:05,899 --> 01:16:08,193
Hey, Sara. Sara,
what's the matter?

1253
01:16:08,318 --> 01:16:10,362
Sara, what's wrong?

1254
01:16:10,404 --> 01:16:12,030
Hey, what's the matter?
What's wrong?

1255
01:16:12,114 --> 01:16:13,907
It's the poison!

1256
01:16:14,032 --> 01:16:15,117
Oh, no.

1257
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,327
No. Hey, Sara.

1258
01:16:17,411 --> 01:16:18,829
Come on. Please. Don't do this!

1259
01:16:18,912 --> 01:16:20,330
Sara, don't do this. Please.

1260
01:16:20,414 --> 01:16:22,124
Jim...

1261
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:25,586
Sara! Hey!

1262
01:16:25,627 --> 01:16:27,921
Sara. Sara, come on. Please.

1263
01:16:27,963 --> 01:16:29,423
Sara.

1264
01:16:29,506 --> 01:16:31,300
Sara, I love you.

1265
01:16:31,425 --> 01:16:34,303
Sara, please.
I love you so much.

1266
01:16:41,435 --> 01:16:43,312
Hey, get away from us!
Leave us alone!

1267
01:16:43,395 --> 01:16:44,521
No, Dad.

1268
01:16:44,605 --> 01:16:46,523
It won't hurt us.

1269
01:17:55,133 --> 01:17:57,594
Elizabeth, is that you?

1270
01:17:57,719 --> 01:18:00,097
Yes, my love.

1271
01:18:00,222 --> 01:18:03,100
The ghost ball was Elizabeth.

1272
01:18:03,225 --> 01:18:06,603
The truth had to be known
for me to be released.

1273
01:18:06,728 --> 01:18:09,231
He saved me.

1274
01:18:11,024 --> 01:18:13,569
It was nothing.

1275
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:15,988
Oh, Elizabeth.

1276
01:18:16,029 --> 01:18:18,323
Yes, my darling?

1277
01:18:19,324 --> 01:18:23,412
I have waited so
long for this moment.

1278
01:18:23,495 --> 01:18:26,623
And now only heaven awaits.

1279
01:18:37,718 --> 01:18:40,429
He's not really
kissing your mom.

1280
01:18:44,725 --> 01:18:46,226
Hey.

1281
01:18:47,519 --> 01:18:49,396
That's my wife.

1282
01:18:58,113 --> 01:18:59,531
Sara?

1283
01:19:06,496 --> 01:19:07,998
Jim?

1284
01:19:08,123 --> 01:19:09,917
I thought I lost you.

1285
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:11,502
Oh.

1286
01:19:12,294 --> 01:19:14,630
I thought I lost you, too.

1287
01:19:15,631 --> 01:19:17,508
I'm back, Sara.

1288
01:19:17,549 --> 01:19:19,301
I'm back.

1289
01:19:22,012 --> 01:19:23,472
Can you ever forgive me?

1290
01:19:23,514 --> 01:19:27,434
Oh, what's to forgive?
You loved her.

1291
01:19:27,518 --> 01:19:30,020
Here. Take this.

1292
01:19:30,998 --> 01:19:31,998
What is it?

1293
01:19:32,022 --> 01:19:34,900
The deed to the house.
It's yours.

1294
01:19:35,025 --> 01:19:36,818
Do with it what you will.

1295
01:19:36,902 --> 01:19:38,820
Sell it, keep it.

1296
01:19:38,904 --> 01:19:42,324
Do whatever makes you
and your family happy.

1297
01:19:48,205 --> 01:19:50,123
And thank you.

1298
01:19:51,333 --> 01:19:54,294
Thank you all so much.

1299
01:20:04,012 --> 01:20:05,931
Wait! Wait for us!

1300
01:20:06,014 --> 01:20:08,517
Hold on!

1301
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:09,810
What's all this?

1302
01:20:09,893 --> 01:20:11,395
Well, I don't know
what we'll need.

1303
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,605
What are you talking about?
We're going to heaven.

1304
01:20:13,730 --> 01:20:14,898
You can't take it with you.

1305
01:20:15,023 --> 01:20:16,692
The hell I can't.

1306
01:20:16,775 --> 01:20:18,402
- Oh.
- Goodbye.

1307
01:20:18,527 --> 01:20:19,903
- Bye-bye.
- Thank you all so much.

1308
01:20:19,945 --> 01:20:20,863
You're welcome.

1309
01:20:20,904 --> 01:20:23,198
- Thank you.
- So long, now.

1310
01:20:23,323 --> 01:20:25,534
Okay, little man. All right.
Hurry!

1311
01:20:25,617 --> 01:20:27,119
Let's go!

1312
01:20:27,202 --> 01:20:28,787
- Bye!
- Bye!

1313
01:20:28,871 --> 01:20:30,414
Okay. Here we go.

1314
01:20:31,999 --> 01:20:33,500
Whoo!

1315
01:20:35,794 --> 01:20:37,296
Bye-bye.

1316
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,403
Angels in heaven
together at last.

1317
01:21:01,528 --> 01:21:04,823
The tale is well ended
for those who have passed.

1318
01:21:04,907 --> 01:21:08,785
Love endures all,
no reason, no rhyme.

1319
01:21:08,869 --> 01:21:12,706
It lasts forever and
forever all time.

1320
01:21:12,748 --> 01:21:14,124
Mom, Leota won't shut up.

1321
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:16,335
- Are we there yet?
- I'm getting pretty hungry.

1322
01:21:16,418 --> 01:21:17,503
Can we get some pizza?

1323
01:21:17,628 --> 01:21:19,004
How long before we
get there, Sara?

1324
01:21:19,129 --> 01:21:20,464
20 minutes tops.

1325
01:21:20,506 --> 01:21:21,965
