...Frankie would have cut
Tommy loose right then.

- Tommy's in a little trouble.
- How little?

Oh. Why isn't he standing here
talking to me?

1696
01:27:17,524 --> 01:27:20,528
Because he can't sing "My Mother's Eyes"

This was not a walk in the park.
This was a sentence.

He takes no pride in his appearance.
In the simple amenities of life.

In a pile on the floor.

1849
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:24,477
That's it, then.

1850
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:27,355
Norm. Tommy.

1851
01:35:28,765 --> 01:35:30,017
Excuse us.

1852
01:35:38,608 --> 01:35:39,655
Hey, Frankie.

1853
01:35:40,902 --> 01:35:41,949
Frankie.

1854
01:35:43,404 --> 01:35:44,576
It's that bad, huh?

1855
01:35:50,662 --> 01:35:51,879
Frankie...

1856
01:35:52,497 --> 01:35:55,967
...you are digging a million-dollar hole
for yourself.

1857
01:35:57,835 --> 01:36:00,964
Tommy took me off the streets, Gyp.
What's that worth?

1858
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:03,558
You'll be on the road till you're 90.

1859
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:07,103
You want, I could arrange a loan.

1860
01:36:07,262 --> 01:36:12,109
Thanks, Mr. DeCarlo, but I don't want anybody
involved in our future besides me and Frankie.

1861
01:36:13,059 --> 01:36:14,936
Hey, I just realized something.

1862
01:36:15,103 --> 01:36:17,231
I don't wanna be in this group anymore.

1863
01:36:17,397 --> 01:36:19,820
FRANKIE: Not now, Nicky.
- No, forget that. I wanna go home.

1864
01:36:19,983 --> 01:36:21,485
What are you talking about?

1865
01:36:22,402 --> 01:36:23,528
I wanna go home.

1866
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:25,868
Good idea.
After the tour, we all take a break.

1867
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:27,282
No. Now.

1868
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:28,495
I quit.

1869
01:36:29,325 --> 01:36:30,827
You can't quit.

1870
01:36:30,994 --> 01:36:33,213
I got his attention. Hi, Bob.

1871
01:36:33,371 --> 01:36:35,749
Nicky, Nicky, we're in
the middle of a tour.

1872
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:38,134
Yeah. You know, I always hated the touring.

1873
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:41,137
Fucking hotels.
Those tiny little bars of soap.

1874
01:36:41,296 --> 01:36:43,719
You're supposed to wash with that?
Can't even see it.

1875
01:36:43,881 --> 01:36:46,475
You're talking crazy.
Calm down and we'll figure it out.

1876
01:36:46,634 --> 01:36:48,181
I already figured it out.

1877
01:36:48,928 --> 01:36:50,305
I'll make it easy for you.

1878
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:52,519
I don't want money.
I don't want side deals.

1879
01:36:52,682 --> 01:36:53,854
All I want is out.

1880
01:36:54,017 --> 01:36:55,394
You're right about the soap.

1881
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,437
Hey, Nicky. Nicky.

1882
01:36:58,438 --> 01:36:59,485
BOB:
Nicky!

1883
01:36:59,647 --> 01:37:02,491
We're in the middle of a damn tour!
Are you crazy?

1884
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:10,333
GYP:
Nicky, wait.

1885
01:37:10,825 --> 01:37:11,951
Wait up.

1886
01:37:13,536 --> 01:37:14,628
Let me understand.

1887
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:17,210
You put in all this time,
you have all these hits...

1888
01:37:17,373 --> 01:37:19,250
...and yet, you're gonna just
walk away?

1889
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:20,714
That is crazy.

1890
01:37:21,878 --> 01:37:25,428
Me and the wife had a little trouble
last year, so you know what I did?

1891
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:27,592
I put the kids with my parents.

1892
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:30,228
And then I told them, my own kids...

1893
01:37:30,386 --> 01:37:34,061
...I made up this thing where I told them
I was really their uncle. Uncle Nick.

1894
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:36,025
I don't understand.

1895
01:37:36,184 --> 01:37:38,562
So I could screw around, you know.
Do what I wanted.

1896
01:37:38,728 --> 01:37:43,074
I figured if I wasn't home to put them to
bed, they wouldn't feel deprived of a father.

1897
01:37:43,649 --> 01:37:45,367
I don't know what to say, Nick.

1898
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:48,238
All due respect, Mr. DeCarlo...

1899
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:51,787
...you sell a hundred million records,
see how you handle it.

1900
01:37:52,241 --> 01:37:54,960
Frankie and Bob,
they're gonna take this hard.

1901
01:37:55,661 --> 01:37:57,129
I'm not worried.

1902
01:37:57,288 --> 01:37:58,961
Those guys, with all their talent...

1903
01:37:59,123 --> 01:38:00,875
...they'll never even know I'm gone.

1904
01:38:13,721 --> 01:38:16,190
You want me to go out there by myself?
Are you nuts?

1905
01:38:16,349 --> 01:38:19,068
Look, there's a lot of great
backup guys out there, right?

1906
01:38:19,227 --> 01:38:21,730
There's Joe Long, Charlie Calello.

1907
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:24,069
We find two more and put you in front.

1908
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:27,443
Get a great drummer.
A horn section like we talked about.

1909
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:29,533
Like Basie and the Kenton band.

1910
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:31,175
- What do you do?
- Write and produce.

1911
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:32,281
I don't like it.

1912
01:38:32,448 --> 01:38:33,916
- Why?
- You're crapping out on me.

1913
01:38:34,075 --> 01:38:36,169
- I thought we had a handshake.
- We do.

1914
01:38:37,078 --> 01:38:39,922
I wake up in the middle of the night,
I don't know where I am.

1915
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:44,131
I think, "What the hell happened?
What's gonna happen? Everybody leaves."

1916
01:38:47,213 --> 01:38:48,806
Why does everybody leave?

1917
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:51,050

01:39:00,435 --> 01:39:01,857
How do you do that?

1920
01:39:02,019 --> 01:39:03,066
What?

1921
01:39:04,605 --> 01:39:06,699
Get me to agree to stuff.

first thing is you stop that.

You could be a great singer.

you got your mother's beauty.

Look, I know how hard it is.

1995
01:44:47,490 --> 01:44:51,120
You got something you wanna share
with the world and nobody gives a shit.

1996
01:44:51,786 --> 01:44:53,834
But then things turn around.

1997
01:44:53,996 --> 01:44:56,749
You have to have patience,
and you gotta keep working.

1998

2012
01:45:47,091 --> 01:45:50,846
...back in the day, we almost left Crewe
because he wouldn't record us a demo.

2013
01:45:51,011 --> 01:45:52,433
Four songs.

2014
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:54,774
And now he's doing it for Francine.

2015
01:45:57,017 --> 01:45:59,736

2017
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:05,034
And her mother,
you think it's about the kid? No.
