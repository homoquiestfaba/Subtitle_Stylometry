1
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,821
Running low, Frank.

2
00:00:53,922 --> 00:00:56,758
Enough to make it back?

3
00:00:56,858 --> 00:00:59,359
Yeah, just enough.

4
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,769
Doesn't look I'm
making this thing back.

5
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,610
There's only one
more plane to make--

6
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:19,647
Yeah, Mike.

7
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:20,982
I'm still up for more.

8
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,351
Thanks for reminding me again.

9
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,420
Hey, I'm just
doing my job, man.

10
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:31,025
All right.

11
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:31,726
Let's head back.

12
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:35,195
Roger that.

13
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,779
Easy.

14
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,854
Mike, there's a train down here.

15
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:00,888
I'm going to take a pass.

16
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,199
Roger that.

17
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,101
Make it fast.

18
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,837
I'm running low on fuel.

19
00:02:15,937 --> 00:02:16,604
And me.

20
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:20,273
Right.

21
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:22,175
That's why I said make it fast.

22
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,821
Man, I love when
those trains explode.

23
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:07,555
Woo!

24
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:11,659
Just in time.

25
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:20,835
Roger that.

26
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:46,426
Mike?

27
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:57,404
Mike!

28
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:12,620
No!

29
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,386
No.

30
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,438
Mayday, mayday.

31
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:34,976
This is Little Blue, over.

32
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:35,643
Mayday.

33
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:37,078
Code red.

34
00:04:57,098 --> 00:04:58,699
Come on, you piece of shit.

35
00:06:57,585 --> 00:07:00,487
How much further you reckon
these white soldiers are?

36
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:01,923
They should be just up ahead.

37
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:06,560
I haven't seen a
minefield all day.

38
00:07:06,661 --> 00:07:07,862
Well, that's the point, Salty.

39
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:10,064
You're not supposed
to see a mine.

40
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:13,433
That's why we find them
and disassemble them.

41
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:15,169
The Germans bury
them at night.

42
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,570
Well, them white
boys don't like that

43
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:19,607
finding them at night stuff.

44
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:21,275
Dammit, Salty, if
the mines don't kill,

45
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,543
us your driving will.

46
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,078
You just let me worry
about the driving.

47
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:25,478
Salty, that's exactly what
I'm worried about because you

48
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,081
can't drive worth a damn.

49
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:28,849
Ain't my fault these roads
are hard as hell on the tranny.

50
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,383
On the tranny.

51
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,450
Yeah, right.

52
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:32,420
Just keep it
straight and true.

53
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,055
I always do, Lieutenant.

54
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:42,630
We figure this is
the last minefield

55
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,832
we're going to have to clear
before we push in to Bellecour?

56
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:47,134
Well, the army don't
like losing tanks.

57
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,502
Yeah.

58
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,171
Best send in the
dark-skinned brothers.

59
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,572
They don't mind losing us.

60
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,874
Crackers in the
back of the bus this time.

61
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:55,710
Ain't no fare you want to ride.

62
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,278
It's what we're
trained to do, gentlemen.

63
00:07:57,378 --> 00:07:59,213
I'm just glad
we're in the fight.

64
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:00,314
Hell yeah?

65
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:01,515
Hell yeah.

66
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,417
And Lord, bless
this Jeep and get us

67
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:05,052
safely through this minefield.

68
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,121
Help us strike down our
enemy who strives to vanquish

69
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:09,390
our divine mission to
restore peace and prosperity

70
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,025
in your mighty Kingdom.

71
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:11,559
Amen.

72
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:17,064
And Lord, please provide
a safe passage and salvation

73
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,866
from Salty's driving, amen.

74
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:19,934
Amen.

75
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:21,435
I don't think that's
how the Lord works.

76
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:22,837
Well, he's supposed to
work in mysterious ways.

77
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:23,304
Yeah.

78
00:08:24,138 --> 00:08:24,839
Funny.

79
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:51,532
You guys wait here.

80
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,248
Hey, sir, can I help you?

81
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:09,383
Yes, Lieutenant.

82
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,585
You're late.

83
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:12,953
Sorry, sir.

84
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:16,891
This mine needs
to be disposed.

85
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:18,225
Yes, sir.

86
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:19,260
That's my job.

87
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,662
Oh, I know it is.

88
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:24,165
Do you think I know it?

89
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:26,133
Yes, sir.

90
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,537
We'll take care of it.

91
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:31,405
Have you swept and cleared
this area for any enemy?

92
00:09:31,506 --> 00:09:33,841
Of course we have, yup.

93
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:37,512
Don't you think we'd be
here if it wasn't clear?

94
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:38,846
I would hope so.

95
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,381
Just get this
cleared, Lieutenant,

96
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:42,283
and then we can get moving.

97
00:09:42,383 --> 00:09:43,217
You're holding us up.

98
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,388
Are we clear?

99
00:09:47,488 --> 00:09:49,090
Crystal, sir.

100
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,073
Help.

101
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:21,188
Faster.

102
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,156
We'll blitz them now.

103
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:22,957
You understand?

104
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:23,991
It's the only thing we have.

105
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,659
Go.

106
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:58,058
Yo, them white boys
don't be looking too happy.

107
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,495
When we around, white
folks ain't ever happy.

108
00:11:01,596 --> 00:11:03,063
That's true.

109
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:03,831
That's true.

110
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:12,373
Found it.

111
00:11:12,473 --> 00:11:13,542
It's a teller mine.

112
00:11:13,642 --> 00:11:14,609
Mark it and blow.

113
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,511
Oh, we're going to blow it.

114
00:11:16,611 --> 00:11:17,311
Salty.

115
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:18,679
Sir?

116
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:19,747
One pound of HG.

117
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:20,714
Sir.

118
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:26,220
Fire!

119
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:44,004
If they hit those
mines, then he's gone.

120
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,873
They hit that
mine, we all gone.

121
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:52,279
Hey, get him.

122
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,480
Don't be stupid.

123
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:02,456
And fire!

124
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:09,029
We've got to help him.

125
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:17,905
We're going to attack.

126
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:20,774
We're going to attack?

127
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:22,776
Thank god he knows
what he's doing.

128
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:26,581
Go, go.

129
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:29,744
We've got to help him.

130
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,179
Cover me.

131
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,148
Got it.

132
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:35,049
On me.

133
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:35,816
Yeah.

134
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:44,592
We will deploy.

135
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:46,493
You will cover us on the spot.

136
00:13:46,594 --> 00:13:47,494
Sir.

137
00:13:47,595 --> 00:13:49,664
There will be no surrender.

138
00:13:49,764 --> 00:13:50,898
You understand?

139
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:47,856
Everything OK, sir?

140
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:48,857
Yeah.

141
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:50,324
Hell yeah?

142
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:51,125
Hell yeah.

143
00:15:00,802 --> 00:15:02,302
What's that round?

144
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:03,605
Bazooka.

145
00:15:03,705 --> 00:15:05,807
Ellison.

146
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:07,040
Army men.

147
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:13,648
We're going to clear down the
trench in the firing line.

148
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:14,649
Understood?

149
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:15,449
Yes, sir.

150
00:15:19,854 --> 00:15:21,455
Ready?

151
00:15:21,556 --> 00:15:23,257
On my mark.

152
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:25,225
Hey, Ellie?

153
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:26,628
Don't miss.

154
00:15:26,728 --> 00:15:31,465
3, 2, now.

155
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:32,534
Over the top.

156
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:50,384
Dozer, I want you to keep
firing and don't let up.

157
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:51,519
Yes, sir.

158
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:52,687
This is your signal.

159
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:12,740
Fire!

160
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:45,573
Hands up!

161
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:51,078
I said, hands up!

162
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:53,347
Get up on them.

163
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:54,348
Both hands.

164
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:56,183
Let me see them, right now.

165
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:34,622
What is this?

166
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:36,156
This look like goose shit.

167
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,090
I can't eat this.

168
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,191
You don't even want this.

169
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:40,093
I ain't seen you eat all day.

170
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:40,962
You ain't nothing else?

171
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,195
You got something else.

172
00:17:42,296 --> 00:17:43,196
That's even worse.
Stop it.

173
00:17:43,297 --> 00:17:44,164
Stop.

174
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:44,933
Y'all shut up.

175
00:17:45,033 --> 00:17:45,934
Y'all shut up.

176
00:17:46,034 --> 00:17:48,503
You got to eat.

177
00:17:48,603 --> 00:17:49,837
Nasty anyway.

178
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:51,238
No worse than your mama makes.

179
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:40,120
Did what I could,
found some real eggs.

180
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:54,569
You did right.

181
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:02,309
But sometimes when you're
right, you're wrong.

182
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:04,177
And when they're
wrong, they're right.

183
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,284
We've got no control over it.

184
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:13,888
I figure the best
we could do is not

185
00:19:13,988 --> 00:19:16,924
fear it, keep moving forward.

186
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:22,830
The rest of the cards, they
have to fall where they fall.

187
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:28,870
You have a way to fight a war.

188
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:29,837
Hell of a way.

189
00:19:36,077 --> 00:19:38,178
Real eggs, huh?

190
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:39,379
Stole them myself.

191
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:02,469
These are real
eggs, all right.

192
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,004
Hell yeah.

193
00:20:11,012 --> 00:20:16,216
I put your name forward for
your battlefield commission.

194
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:18,119
Why is that?

195
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:21,089
Because the army needs
good Black officers.

196
00:20:21,189 --> 00:20:23,057
But me?

197
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:23,991
That's right, Red.

198
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:32,200
Does that mean I'd have to
leave the-- leave the men?

199
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:33,668
There is a probability.

200
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:39,507
Thank you.

201
00:20:39,607 --> 00:20:45,713
Look, you don't have to accept
it, but you do deserve it.

202
00:20:45,813 --> 00:20:46,848
Think about it.

203
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:53,855
In the army, we
salute officers.

204
00:20:58,526 --> 00:21:00,728
I don't believe you
heard the Lieutenant.

205
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,365
We don't salute Negroes.

206
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,568
We don't salute the
color of a man's skin.

207
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:12,039
You'll either
salute the Lieutenant

208
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,708
or pick your teeth
up off the ground.

209
00:21:34,028 --> 00:21:35,730
Now, was that so hard?

210
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:40,268
What are you all looking at?

211
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:43,271
Get back to work!

212
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:55,082
Lieutenant.

213
00:21:55,183 --> 00:21:55,983
Sergeant.

214
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:56,751
Sir.

215
00:22:00,655 --> 00:22:04,258
Well, I'm up to my elbows in
logistics for a push into Metz,

216
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:05,760
and all the division
seems to care

217
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,528
about is putting together
a damn search party

218
00:22:07,628 --> 00:22:09,362
for some crashed fighter pilot.

219
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:10,631
Can you believe that?

220
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:11,666
No, sir.

221
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:13,034
So I'm hoping you
have the scouting report

222
00:22:13,134 --> 00:22:13,968
on the blue sector.

223
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:16,304
Yes, sir.

224
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:18,773
Zone blue is clear.

225
00:22:18,873 --> 00:22:21,408
We double our push
from green into blue,

226
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:25,412
we can clear those mines
without any issue, sir.

227
00:22:27,782 --> 00:22:30,084
Protect Metz from the northeast?

228
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:31,886
It's the best route, sir.

229
00:22:31,986 --> 00:22:32,687
It's all here.

230
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,229
You're one of my
best, Lieutenant.

231
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:43,097
Thank you, sir.

232
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:46,067
So I heard
you had trouble up there.

233
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:48,169
The Germans sprung
an ambush on us.

234
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:49,737
Thick?

235
00:22:49,837 --> 00:22:53,207
Tanks, AT guns, machine guns,
and mortars, 50 to 60 men.

236
00:22:53,307 --> 00:22:54,876
We cleared the sector.

237
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,111
Good.

238
00:22:57,211 --> 00:22:58,613
Well, I meant to
address both of you

239
00:22:58,713 --> 00:22:59,981
up front about a few things.

240
00:23:03,818 --> 00:23:08,089
Well, I received the
paperwork for your battlefield

241
00:23:08,189 --> 00:23:09,422
commission.

242
00:23:09,523 --> 00:23:10,858
Congratulations, Sergeant.

243
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:11,993
Thank you, sir.

244
00:23:12,093 --> 00:23:13,794
Well, I don't know what
the army's going to say.

245
00:23:13,895 --> 00:23:17,098
It's not very common for them to
approve a commission like that.

246
00:23:17,198 --> 00:23:18,398
I understand, sir.

247
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:20,268
But I forwarded the
paperwork up to division

248
00:23:20,368 --> 00:23:22,503
with my recommendation.

249
00:23:22,603 --> 00:23:24,471
You certainly deserve it.

250
00:23:24,572 --> 00:23:26,040
Thank you, sir.

251
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,544
Now, I'm going to have to be
straight with you, Lieutenant.

252
00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:32,546
Division has
reassigned you pending

253
00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:34,447
an investigation
into your conduct

254
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:36,117
during yesterday's mission.

255
00:23:36,217 --> 00:23:37,450
Investigation?

256
00:23:37,551 --> 00:23:39,053
Well, someone's
trying to pin the blame

257
00:23:39,153 --> 00:23:41,355
for that German ambush on you.

258
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:45,326
But, sir, that ain't at all.

259
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:46,794
It was them crack--

260
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:49,196
it was them white soldiers
that didn't do their job.

261
00:23:49,297 --> 00:23:50,798
They didn't clear the sector.

262
00:23:50,898 --> 00:23:54,368
Major Anderson, with all due
respect, sir, I did my job.

263
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:56,037
Sir, this just ain't right.

264
00:23:56,137 --> 00:23:57,204
Look.

265
00:23:57,305 --> 00:23:59,373
I know we're snowed.

266
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:01,242
You give me three
or four days, I'll

267
00:24:01,342 --> 00:24:03,476
have these charges dismissed.

268
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:06,247
What about my men, sir?

269
00:24:06,347 --> 00:24:07,381
Well, Red here
will have a chance

270
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,284
to show an officer he can be.

271
00:24:10,384 --> 00:24:11,719
But--

272
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:15,589
I don't like it either,
but it's the best I can do.

273
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,091
Where do I report, sir?

274
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:19,660
Report to command post eight
on the other side of camp.

275
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,596
They'll take you back to
division for reassignment.

276
00:24:29,737 --> 00:24:32,073
Look, we'll fight
this, and we'll win.

277
00:24:32,173 --> 00:24:33,407
Keep your head up, Lieutenant.

278
00:24:33,507 --> 00:24:34,241
Yes, sir.

279
00:24:44,518 --> 00:24:47,254
I'm sorry about that, sir.

280
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:50,490
Hey, don't even
worry about it.

281
00:24:50,591 --> 00:24:52,492
I need you to take
care of the men.

282
00:24:52,593 --> 00:24:55,096
They're just as much
yours as they are mine.

283
00:24:56,597 --> 00:24:59,166
I'll fill you in
when I get back.

284
00:24:59,266 --> 00:25:00,034
All right?

285
00:25:00,134 --> 00:25:00,634
All right.

286
00:25:00,735 --> 00:25:01,702
All right.

287
00:25:01,802 --> 00:25:02,370
- Good luck.
- Take care.

288
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,137
Thanks.

289
00:25:32,501 --> 00:25:35,036
Nice to see you
again, Lieutenant.

290
00:25:37,438 --> 00:25:38,739
You just don't learn, do you?

291
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:42,777
What they hell do think
you're doing, Lieutenant.

292
00:25:42,877 --> 00:25:44,578
Sir, it's not
what it looks like.

293
00:25:44,678 --> 00:25:48,616
Do you understand
English, Lieutenant?

294
00:25:48,716 --> 00:25:50,951
Yes, I do, sir.

295
00:25:51,052 --> 00:25:52,119
That's better.

296
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,855
That's the one, Captain.

297
00:25:54,955 --> 00:25:56,791
This is the one
that's been giving

298
00:25:56,891 --> 00:25:58,392
you boys all this trouble?

299
00:25:58,492 --> 00:25:59,360
Sir, it is not--

300
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,663
Did I ask you, Lieutenant?

301
00:26:05,534 --> 00:26:06,834
Now, the army may have
given you that rank,

302
00:26:06,934 --> 00:26:10,771
but that don't mean
shit to me or my boys.

303
00:26:10,871 --> 00:26:14,442
So that's your
place, in the back.

304
00:26:14,543 --> 00:26:15,276
Enjoy it.

305
00:26:20,314 --> 00:26:22,049
Yes, sir.

306
00:26:38,933 --> 00:26:39,767
Mount up!

307
00:27:10,731 --> 00:27:14,935
Red, I've seen
that face before.

308
00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:18,507
Where the army
got us going next?

309
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:20,307
Everybody, listen up.

310
00:27:20,407 --> 00:27:21,208
Listen up.

311
00:27:27,047 --> 00:27:28,415
There's no right
way to say this,

312
00:27:28,517 --> 00:27:30,718
so I'm just going to say it.

313
00:27:30,818 --> 00:27:32,353
Lieutenant Hayes
has been temporarily

314
00:27:32,453 --> 00:27:33,888
reassigned to division.

315
00:27:33,988 --> 00:27:34,321
What?

316
00:27:34,421 --> 00:27:35,624
What?

317
00:27:35,723 --> 00:27:37,291
I said temporarily.

318
00:27:37,391 --> 00:27:39,360
For what?

319
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,597
Pending an investigation.

320
00:27:42,696 --> 00:27:44,265
Now, look.

321
00:27:44,365 --> 00:27:46,967
Now, Hayes can handle himself.

322
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:49,571
Before long, he'll--
he'll be back.

323
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:52,373
Until then, we're not going to
disappoint him when he returns,

324
00:27:52,473 --> 00:27:53,207
are we?

325
00:27:53,307 --> 00:27:54,208
No, Sergeant.

326
00:27:54,308 --> 00:27:55,409
All right.

327
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,178
Now, I want those field
radios cleaned and working

328
00:27:57,278 --> 00:27:57,745
by the end of the day.

329
00:27:57,845 --> 00:27:58,647
Understand?

330
00:27:58,746 --> 00:27:59,446
Yes, Sergeant.

331
00:27:59,548 --> 00:28:00,447
Make a hole.

332
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:04,451
You boys heard the sergeant.

333
00:28:04,553 --> 00:28:05,920
Let's get back to work.

334
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,556
Sit down.

335
00:28:07,656 --> 00:28:08,422
No, I'm serious.

336
00:28:29,343 --> 00:28:30,444
Damn it.

337
00:28:30,545 --> 00:28:32,581
How's it going?

338
00:28:32,681 --> 00:28:34,081
Something's not right.

339
00:28:34,181 --> 00:28:36,283
We should have hit
division a long time ago.

340
00:28:49,797 --> 00:28:51,566
Hey, gents.

341
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:54,034
Son of a bitch.

342
00:28:54,134 --> 00:28:56,303
I'm familiar with the area.

343
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:57,938
If you want, I can help.

344
00:28:58,038 --> 00:29:00,542
And get us all killed
like those other soldiers

345
00:29:00,642 --> 00:29:03,811
you tried to help?

346
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:05,246
Not on my watch.

347
00:29:09,584 --> 00:29:10,751
Get on the radio.

348
00:29:10,851 --> 00:29:12,353
Find out where the hell we are.

349
00:29:43,551 --> 00:29:45,486
This
is Mike Devine from UN.

350
00:29:45,587 --> 00:29:46,920
Here.

351
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:48,590
We believe
we are at sector 17B,

352
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,958
pushing our way to division.

353
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:52,426
Our current location
we believe to be

354
00:29:52,527 --> 00:29:58,332
52 degrees north latitude,
19 degrees east longitude.

355
00:29:58,432 --> 00:29:59,734
Americans.

356
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:02,269
- I
- repeat, 52 north, 19 east.

357
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,810
Americans, no--
the half tracks.

358
00:30:32,032 --> 00:30:33,200
What's going on?

359
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:33,901
Shut up!

360
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:35,069
We're working.

361
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:36,303
What?

362
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:38,305
I said, shut up--

363
00:30:38,405 --> 00:30:39,306
sorry, Sarge.

364
00:30:39,406 --> 00:30:40,274
I ain't know it was you.

365
00:30:40,374 --> 00:30:42,142
Look, I can't find
a frequency if you

366
00:30:42,242 --> 00:30:44,011
all keep flapping your lips.

367
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:45,647
What the hell is going on?

368
00:30:45,747 --> 00:30:47,716
Well, you said that Hayes
is being reassigned, right?

369
00:30:47,816 --> 00:30:49,249
Yeah.

370
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,851
Well, Salty got his hands
on some radio frequency codes.

371
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:53,020
It sounds like your boy is
in some sort of trouble.

372
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,923
They got lost
behind the lines.

373
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:56,857
Give me that.

374
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:41,870
God damn it.

375
00:31:41,969 --> 00:31:42,771
Get back to your vehicle.

376
00:31:42,871 --> 00:31:43,805
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

377
00:31:43,904 --> 00:31:45,774
You don't hear that?

378
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:08,897
Red one, red one.

379
00:32:08,996 --> 00:32:10,264
This is Charlie 49er.

380
00:32:10,364 --> 00:32:11,833
I repeat, this is Charlie 49er.

381
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:13,200
We're under attack.

382
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,569
We're going back into the woods.

383
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:16,437
I repeat, we are going
back into the woods.

384
00:32:16,538 --> 00:32:16,905
Stop.

385
00:32:17,004 --> 00:32:17,906
Stop.

386
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:18,773
You'll reveal the location.

387
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:23,010
Get him back, Salty.

388
00:33:10,023 --> 00:33:10,925
Fire!

389
00:33:18,933 --> 00:33:19,601
Major.

390
00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:24,572
Sergeant.

391
00:33:24,672 --> 00:33:25,573
Sir.

392
00:33:25,673 --> 00:33:26,641
You heard about the ambush.

393
00:33:26,741 --> 00:33:29,009
Sir, we got to go rescue them.

394
00:33:29,109 --> 00:33:31,044
We can't be sure anyone
made it out of that.

395
00:33:31,144 --> 00:33:33,915
But sir, if there's a
possibility he might be alive,

396
00:33:34,014 --> 00:33:35,082
we-- we got to go get him.

397
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:36,784
I don't have the
authority to send out

398
00:33:36,885 --> 00:33:37,986
a rescue party at this time.

399
00:33:38,085 --> 00:33:40,287
But sir, it would
just take-- just--

400
00:33:40,387 --> 00:33:43,658
We cannot go charging off
on some rescue operation.

401
00:33:43,758 --> 00:33:45,827
We've got a city to
take and a war to win.

402
00:33:45,927 --> 00:33:46,761
But, sir--

403
00:33:46,861 --> 00:33:47,929
There's nothing I can do.

404
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:49,429
Hayes is a smart man.

405
00:33:49,531 --> 00:33:52,065
If he's still alive, he'll
find a way to make it back.

406
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:54,067
But we have no way of--

407
00:33:56,771 --> 00:33:57,437
sir.

408
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,026
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

409
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:20,862
Easy, Lieutenant.

410
00:34:20,962 --> 00:34:22,462
Think about it.

411
00:34:22,564 --> 00:34:24,566
Get over here.

412
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:25,967
Come on.

413
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:00,868
Get down!

414
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:01,603
Shh.

415
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:08,408
Follow me.

416
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,593
I don't see any more Germans.

417
00:35:25,693 --> 00:35:28,128
Good.

418
00:35:28,228 --> 00:35:31,231
You're lucky I was around.

419
00:35:31,331 --> 00:35:33,935
I was doing just fine.

420
00:35:34,035 --> 00:35:36,104
You a pilot?

421
00:35:36,203 --> 00:35:37,471
Yeah.

422
00:35:37,572 --> 00:35:42,242
Well, I was until
I was shot down.

423
00:35:42,342 --> 00:35:45,278
Maybe I'm the one
that's rescuing you.

424
00:35:45,379 --> 00:35:47,214
Hey, I was doing
just fine until you

425
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:50,752
brought the whole damn German
army right on top of me.

426
00:35:50,852 --> 00:35:52,419
Welcome to the war.

427
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,921
Will you just
get on your radio

428
00:35:54,022 --> 00:35:55,455
and call in reinforcements?

429
00:35:57,859 --> 00:35:59,927
Are all you pilots this dumb?

430
00:36:00,028 --> 00:36:01,361
This is a ham radio.

431
00:36:01,461 --> 00:36:03,330
We don't have near enough
range to make contact.

432
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,767
And even if we did, we have
half the German army between us,

433
00:36:05,867 --> 00:36:06,534
remember?

434
00:36:11,706 --> 00:36:13,675
What are you doing?

435
00:36:13,775 --> 00:36:15,043
Hey.

436
00:36:15,143 --> 00:36:17,078
Stay down.

437
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:19,614
Ooh.

438
00:36:19,714 --> 00:36:22,083
Where are you going?

439
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:24,251
There still are
Germans out there.

440
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:27,889
Hey.

441
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:37,330
Listen up, listen up.

442
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:45,372
Now, the major told me there's
nothing we can do for Hayes.

443
00:36:46,908 --> 00:36:47,675
Come on, man.

444
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:48,475
Hell no.

445
00:36:54,816 --> 00:36:55,183
Listen.

446
00:36:55,282 --> 00:36:55,883
Hold on.

447
00:36:55,983 --> 00:36:57,085
Hold on.

448
00:36:57,185 --> 00:36:58,619
We can't leave him
out there, Sarge.

449
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,187
Right.

450
00:36:59,286 --> 00:37:00,287
Hayes is alive.

451
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:01,689
That's right.

452
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:03,891
We just don't have
the orders, they say.

453
00:37:06,326 --> 00:37:07,461
We've got to go.

454
00:37:07,562 --> 00:37:09,329
We can't leave him
stranded like that.

455
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:12,432
But you know what I say?

456
00:37:12,533 --> 00:37:15,235
I say, to hell with orders.

457
00:37:15,335 --> 00:37:17,672
Yeah.

458
00:37:17,772 --> 00:37:19,774
We're going to find
Hayes and bring him back.

459
00:37:25,813 --> 00:37:27,882
Shh, shh.

460
00:37:27,982 --> 00:37:30,752
Now, does anybody have
any ideas for a plan?

461
00:37:35,056 --> 00:37:35,990
Anybody else?

462
00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:44,165
Salty, why are we at the PX?

463
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:45,499
Trust me.

464
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,101
Old Thomas will help us.

465
00:37:47,201 --> 00:37:49,670
You mean the mail sergeant?

466
00:37:49,771 --> 00:37:50,772
Come on, man.

467
00:37:50,872 --> 00:37:53,040
Let's go.

468
00:37:53,141 --> 00:37:53,808
Thomas.

469
00:37:56,811 --> 00:37:57,612
You got my money?

470
00:38:00,615 --> 00:38:01,281
Me?

471
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:02,750
I owe you money?

472
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,719
Man, give me my money.

473
00:38:04,819 --> 00:38:07,487
You be your own
people, your own people.

474
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,827
Don't stop.

475
00:38:12,927 --> 00:38:13,628
That was it.

476
00:38:13,728 --> 00:38:14,394
Interest.

477
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:21,969
You take your little
$7, then you stupid--

478
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:23,104
All of it.

479
00:38:23,204 --> 00:38:24,572
You ain't gonna
leave me no money.

480
00:38:24,672 --> 00:38:26,541
You're lucky it's not more.

481
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:29,243
You-- you're just going
to count it in my face?

482
00:38:29,342 --> 00:38:31,913
So let me just
get a dollar back.

483
00:38:32,013 --> 00:38:35,049
Pleasure doing business.

484
00:38:35,149 --> 00:38:36,951
Salty, not him.

485
00:38:37,051 --> 00:38:37,885
Let's go.

486
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:39,020
We'll find another way.

487
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,123
I heard about Hayes.

488
00:38:42,223 --> 00:38:43,825
What a loss.

489
00:38:43,925 --> 00:38:45,026
He was a damn good man.

490
00:38:48,729 --> 00:38:49,997
What do you know about Hayes?

491
00:38:52,533 --> 00:38:54,434
Look around you, son.

492
00:38:54,535 --> 00:38:55,970
I own the news around here.

493
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,573
Well look, Thomas, look,
that's why we're here.

494
00:38:58,673 --> 00:38:59,941
We think Hayes is alive.

495
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:02,109
We want to go out and find
him and bring him back.

496
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,678
Now, can you help us out?

497
00:39:03,778 --> 00:39:05,246
Depends.

498
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:07,915
What constitutes help?

499
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:11,719
We need fuel, gear, and ammo,
enough for two or three days.

500
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:15,723
Gear and ammo
for two or three days?

501
00:39:15,823 --> 00:39:18,926
That's-- that's a lot of
supplies on short notice,

502
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:21,295
gentlemen, with no
acquisition orders?

503
00:39:21,394 --> 00:39:22,830
Salty, let's go.

504
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:23,664
Not this guy.

505
00:39:23,764 --> 00:39:24,832
Let's go.

506
00:39:24,932 --> 00:39:29,369
Sounds like you boys
can use some tank support.

507
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:30,872
Who is this?

508
00:39:30,972 --> 00:39:34,775
Sergeant Warren
Creasy, first squad.

509
00:39:34,876 --> 00:39:37,278
Yeah, I let him sleep off his
hangovers up there sometimes.

510
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:41,381
Pays me good.

511
00:39:41,481 --> 00:39:42,717
Now, why would you help us?

512
00:39:42,817 --> 00:39:44,619
You're trying to
kill crouch, right?

513
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:47,622
But we don't exactly have
orders for such a mission.

514
00:39:47,722 --> 00:39:51,359
I've never been too
fond of taking orders.

515
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:52,293
Clearly.

516
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:53,094
Hey, hey.

517
00:39:55,596 --> 00:39:58,498
I know what it looks
like, man, but--

518
00:39:58,599 --> 00:39:59,367
and we need that.

519
00:39:59,466 --> 00:40:00,400
We do.

520
00:40:03,304 --> 00:40:04,739
Suppose you show
us these tanks.

521
00:40:16,449 --> 00:40:17,852
Light tanks?

522
00:40:17,952 --> 00:40:21,989
I don't like the
size of them for you.

523
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:25,593
Girls can go pound
for pound, take out

524
00:40:25,693 --> 00:40:28,729
any front line in a firefight.

525
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:32,767
This is California
Love, Blood and Guts.

526
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:39,340
That's my baby
right there, Alamo.

527
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:40,875
Oh, I like her.

528
00:40:40,975 --> 00:40:44,645
These are real men out here,
real men that have put it

529
00:40:44,745 --> 00:40:47,114
all on the line, real killers.

530
00:40:47,214 --> 00:40:49,183
They look pretty green to me.

531
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:52,086
Two years in the
Georgia swamps,

532
00:40:52,186 --> 00:40:57,892
six months in the blistering hot
sun of Texas, training for war.

533
00:40:57,992 --> 00:41:01,595
Almost nine months
training for Germans.

534
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:03,698
Looks are deceiving.

535
00:41:03,798 --> 00:41:04,865
OK.

536
00:41:04,966 --> 00:41:05,666
Follow me.

537
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:19,947
500 gallons of gasoline?

538
00:41:20,047 --> 00:41:21,349
Who made that order?

539
00:41:21,449 --> 00:41:22,550
Yes, who?

540
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:26,821
Well, you hold on to
that order till I find

541
00:41:26,921 --> 00:41:28,956
out what the hell is going on.

542
00:41:29,056 --> 00:41:31,392
Right.

543
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:33,327
Yeah, we heard about
Lieutenant Hayes.

544
00:41:33,427 --> 00:41:34,795
Shame.

545
00:41:34,895 --> 00:41:35,763
I saw Red.

546
00:41:35,863 --> 00:41:37,198
He wasn't too happy
about it either.

547
00:41:37,298 --> 00:41:38,032
None of us are.

548
00:41:42,036 --> 00:41:42,970
Anything else?

549
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,839
Sir, you know about
that missing pilot

550
00:41:44,939 --> 00:41:47,074
that division's
been asking about?

551
00:41:49,643 --> 00:41:52,279
Well, they say he shot
down a German jet plane,

552
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,647
one of Germany's new weapons.

553
00:41:53,748 --> 00:41:55,983
They say that pilot
landed in the same sector

554
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:57,785
that Lieutenant Hayes
went missing in.

555
00:42:00,788 --> 00:42:04,058
Division would like
this pilot found.

556
00:42:04,158 --> 00:42:06,560
Put together a search
party, Hayes could be found.

557
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,496
Well, division
would be pleased, sir.

558
00:42:08,596 --> 00:42:10,231
But there's no way
division is going to improve

559
00:42:10,331 --> 00:42:13,434
redirecting our field
artillery when our-- our push

560
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:15,603
is 36 hours away.

561
00:42:19,073 --> 00:42:22,309
Oh, sir, I forgot
to tell you that um--

562
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:25,813
well, General Patton just
confirmed his arrival for troop

563
00:42:25,913 --> 00:42:28,482
review before pushing to Metz.

564
00:42:28,582 --> 00:42:30,451
Didn't you serve
with him in Africa?

565
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:31,819
I did.

566
00:42:31,919 --> 00:42:32,620
Huh.

567
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,288
Yeah, that's what I thought.

568
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:37,725
A damn fine man.

569
00:42:37,825 --> 00:42:40,194
Well, thank you, Sergeant.

570
00:42:40,294 --> 00:42:41,695
You've been very helpful.

571
00:42:41,796 --> 00:42:43,230
Sir, keep the pen.

572
00:42:46,767 --> 00:42:48,702
Smith?

573
00:42:48,803 --> 00:42:50,805
Give me a line to
the third army.

574
00:42:50,905 --> 00:42:53,007
I'm on it, sir.

575
00:42:53,107 --> 00:42:54,341
Someone get my Jeep.

576
00:42:58,479 --> 00:43:00,549
You're making noise.

577
00:43:00,648 --> 00:43:01,649
I'm not trying to.

578
00:43:01,749 --> 00:43:04,618
Just avoid
the thick stuff.

579
00:43:04,718 --> 00:43:06,821
You've never been
in the woods before?

580
00:43:06,921 --> 00:43:07,655
Sure.

581
00:43:07,755 --> 00:43:09,390
Central Park.

582
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:10,925
Central Park?

583
00:43:11,025 --> 00:43:12,193
In New York?

584
00:43:12,293 --> 00:43:13,461
Yeah.

585
00:43:13,562 --> 00:43:15,162
It's not the same
thing, city boy.

586
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:20,868
Where are we even going?

587
00:43:20,968 --> 00:43:24,338
Random mill, up the road.

588
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:25,439
Well, are we close yet?

589
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,841
No, we're not close.

590
00:43:26,941 --> 00:43:28,442
We're a long way from
the line, and we're

591
00:43:28,543 --> 00:43:31,445
a long way from New York.

592
00:43:31,546 --> 00:43:32,880
Are all you like that?

593
00:43:37,952 --> 00:43:38,319
Who?

594
00:43:38,419 --> 00:43:40,321
Blacks?

595
00:43:40,421 --> 00:43:41,689
No.

596
00:43:41,789 --> 00:43:43,724
I meant ground pounders,
leg boys like yourself.

597
00:43:47,728 --> 00:43:50,231
Goodbye, city
boy, and good luck.

598
00:43:50,331 --> 00:43:55,069
I'm leaving your dumb ass
before you get me killed.

599
00:43:55,169 --> 00:43:57,338
Hey, get back here.

600
00:43:57,438 --> 00:43:58,205
That's an order.

601
00:44:02,611 --> 00:44:03,310
An order?

602
00:44:05,913 --> 00:44:09,083
I follow orders to
ensure mission success.

603
00:44:09,183 --> 00:44:11,719
Hell, I'll follow
orders to save a life.

604
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:14,688
But what I won't do is
follow orders that will

605
00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:16,625
willfully getting me killed.

606
00:44:16,724 --> 00:44:18,959
I'm not trying
to get you killed.

607
00:44:21,729 --> 00:44:24,765
Goodbye, Lieutenant.

608
00:44:24,865 --> 00:44:27,001
And don't follow me.

609
00:44:40,281 --> 00:44:41,182
All right.

610
00:44:41,282 --> 00:44:42,584
Giddy up, god damn it.

611
00:44:42,683 --> 00:44:45,352
Major Anderson,
the 761st battalion.

612
00:44:45,452 --> 00:44:46,420
I need to speak to the general.

613
00:44:46,521 --> 00:44:47,821
Come on, men.

614
00:44:47,922 --> 00:44:50,791
Hitler's waiting for us.

615
00:44:50,891 --> 00:44:52,627
We've got all day.

616
00:44:52,726 --> 00:44:54,195
I'm going to need you
to stop right there, sir.

617
00:44:54,295 --> 00:44:57,765
I've seen old
whores move faster than that.

618
00:44:57,865 --> 00:45:01,302
General, sir.

619
00:45:01,402 --> 00:45:02,736
You lost, son?

620
00:45:02,836 --> 00:45:06,473
Major Anderson,
sir, 761st battalion.

621
00:45:06,575 --> 00:45:12,146
Ah, I expect a lot from
those Black tankers, Major.

622
00:45:12,246 --> 00:45:14,848
I served under
you, sir, Gershwin

623
00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:17,985
Pass, command B, first armored.

624
00:45:18,085 --> 00:45:21,855
My boys took on a
minefields, 15th Panzer, sir.

625
00:45:21,956 --> 00:45:23,490
Licked them good.

626
00:45:23,592 --> 00:45:26,260
Anderson.

627
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,795
Yeah.

628
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:30,831
Hell of a fine job you did
with those boys in Athens.

629
00:45:30,931 --> 00:45:32,299
Damn good job.

630
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:33,801
Fine work, fine work.

631
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:36,470
Those Black tankers are
damn proud to have you.

632
00:45:36,571 --> 00:45:37,371
Thank you, sir.

633
00:45:37,471 --> 00:45:38,707
I have a request, sir.

634
00:45:38,806 --> 00:45:40,741
I'd like to redirect the
division of artillery

635
00:45:40,841 --> 00:45:45,045
this evening, grid section 843.

636
00:45:45,145 --> 00:45:46,681
Sure, sure.

637
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,917
Anything for a regular
Stonewall Jackson.

638
00:45:50,017 --> 00:45:53,555
I am counting on you and your
boys to get us into Metz.

639
00:45:53,655 --> 00:45:54,989
Don't let me down.

640
00:45:55,089 --> 00:45:55,724
No, sir.

641
00:45:57,992 --> 00:46:01,028
Thank you, sir.

642
00:46:01,128 --> 00:46:01,730
All right.

643
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:02,597
Giddy up, god damn it.

644
00:46:02,697 --> 00:46:03,364
Let's go.

645
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,400
Load them up, boys.

646
00:46:06,501 --> 00:46:08,168
Let's move them out.

647
00:46:08,269 --> 00:46:08,936
Here we go.

648
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:13,541
Hayes' last known position.

649
00:46:13,642 --> 00:46:16,010
Now, I suggest we
take Fagan Roadway,

650
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:17,911
send your tanks
down this rail line

651
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:21,849
here, convene at this juncture.

652
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:25,553
That rail line
should be just fine.

653
00:46:25,654 --> 00:46:26,787
What about the Germans?

654
00:46:26,887 --> 00:46:28,188
We leave at night.

655
00:46:28,289 --> 00:46:30,190
Artillery might
help confuse them.

656
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:32,826
Those snatch-and-grab
stewards provide service

657
00:46:32,926 --> 00:46:35,462
to protect us from the Krauts.

658
00:46:35,563 --> 00:46:38,899
Tonight, zero 100 departure.

659
00:46:38,999 --> 00:46:41,435
Don't be late.

660
00:46:41,536 --> 00:46:43,037
Mail's always on time, son.

661
00:46:43,137 --> 00:46:45,873
So how much is this
favor going to cost us?

662
00:46:50,944 --> 00:46:52,547
I'll decide that if
you all make it back.

663
00:46:55,149 --> 00:46:58,285
Make sure you're there.

664
00:46:58,385 --> 00:47:00,888
You can count on it.

665
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:03,490
Gentlemen, don't fuck this up.

666
00:47:14,368 --> 00:47:17,505
Come on.

667
00:47:17,605 --> 00:47:18,305
Stupid flies.

668
00:47:21,408 --> 00:47:24,144
Stop!

669
00:47:24,244 --> 00:47:27,615
Don't move.

670
00:47:27,716 --> 00:47:29,818
You're in a minefield.

671
00:47:29,917 --> 00:47:30,918
Shit.

672
00:47:31,018 --> 00:47:32,152
What do I do?

673
00:47:32,252 --> 00:47:35,122
Put your foot back
into your last step.

674
00:47:35,222 --> 00:47:36,658
Breathe.

675
00:47:36,758 --> 00:47:39,360
Stay calm.

676
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,962
OK.

677
00:47:42,062 --> 00:47:43,464
What are you doing?

678
00:47:43,565 --> 00:47:47,134
I'm going to come out
and get you, clear a path,

679
00:47:47,234 --> 00:47:49,704
and bring you back to safety.

680
00:47:49,804 --> 00:47:51,872
But I can see them.

681
00:47:51,972 --> 00:47:54,875
Oh, that ain't all of them.

682
00:48:02,082 --> 00:48:04,084
I don't want to see
anyone here slacking.

683
00:48:04,184 --> 00:48:04,686
Come on.

684
00:48:04,786 --> 00:48:06,086
Move, gentlemen.

685
00:48:08,857 --> 00:48:10,491
Sergeant.

686
00:48:10,592 --> 00:48:12,326
Major.

687
00:48:12,426 --> 00:48:13,728
Mail drop off, sir?

688
00:48:13,828 --> 00:48:16,598
It's a little late, but I hope
it can still find its way out.

689
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:26,340
Make sure that's delivered
on time and on target.

690
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,241
Yes, sir.

691
00:48:35,884 --> 00:48:37,284
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

692
00:48:46,594 --> 00:48:49,196
How's it coming?

693
00:48:49,296 --> 00:48:51,198
Looks like old Thomas
made good on his promise.

694
00:48:55,369 --> 00:48:56,203
Oh, shit.

695
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:01,709
This don't look good.

696
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:10,417
This mission is unauthorized.

697
00:49:10,518 --> 00:49:12,119
I can't let you leave.

698
00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:13,922
I'm ordering you
all to stand down.

699
00:49:14,021 --> 00:49:15,989
I'm afraid we
can't do that, sir.

700
00:49:25,232 --> 00:49:28,469
Listen, Red, if
you do this, there's

701
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:30,971
no way in hell
divisions can improve

702
00:49:31,071 --> 00:49:32,306
your battlefield commission.

703
00:49:32,406 --> 00:49:35,643
If that's what it takes, sir.

704
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,044
Don't you want
to be an officer?

705
00:49:37,144 --> 00:49:39,213
Sir, I'll trade all the
commendations in this army

706
00:49:39,313 --> 00:49:40,347
for Lieutenant Hayes.

707
00:49:43,952 --> 00:49:45,052
That's what I thought.

708
00:49:47,755 --> 00:49:52,125
You got 24 hours, courtesy
of General George Patton.

709
00:49:52,226 --> 00:49:52,993
I'm sorry, sir.

710
00:49:53,093 --> 00:49:54,161
I don't understand.

711
00:49:54,261 --> 00:49:55,362
Find Hayes and bring him back.

712
00:49:55,462 --> 00:49:57,899
If you find an American
pilot out there,

713
00:49:57,998 --> 00:50:01,703
bring him back as well.

714
00:50:01,803 --> 00:50:03,671
Don't let me down, Sergeant.

715
00:50:03,771 --> 00:50:04,438
Good luck.

716
00:50:04,539 --> 00:50:05,339
Thank you, sir.

717
00:50:09,611 --> 00:50:10,812
Well, I'll be damned.

718
00:50:10,912 --> 00:50:12,412
Line up.

719
00:50:22,857 --> 00:50:27,261
It's best to keep your
mind from thinking about it.

720
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:29,797
OK.

721
00:50:29,898 --> 00:50:30,532
OK.

722
00:50:38,438 --> 00:50:41,108
We've got one more
thing there to my case.

723
00:50:46,014 --> 00:50:51,318
My wingman, I got him killed.

724
00:50:58,526 --> 00:51:01,128
I tried to take on this
new type of German plane.

725
00:51:03,731 --> 00:51:04,666
It was foolish, really.

726
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:13,775
Mike, I should have
listened to you.

727
00:51:17,311 --> 00:51:19,514
Should have headed
back to police.

728
00:51:19,614 --> 00:51:21,114
He intercepted
that German plane,

729
00:51:21,214 --> 00:51:28,155
and he got shot and died.

730
00:51:51,546 --> 00:51:55,883
A friend of mine once
told me the best thing you

731
00:51:55,984 --> 00:52:00,855
can do in a war is to not fear.

732
00:52:00,955 --> 00:52:02,890
You just got to let the
cards fall where they fall.

733
00:52:06,661 --> 00:52:17,505
What happened to Mike,
it wasn't your fault.

734
00:52:17,605 --> 00:52:21,609
Now, just make sure to stay
on the path that I just made.

735
00:52:26,413 --> 00:52:28,281
It's this way, watch out.

736
00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:47,869
Next mile and a half,
we'll find the man,

737
00:52:47,969 --> 00:52:49,737
whatever it takes to stop.

738
00:53:09,724 --> 00:53:12,026
Hold it.

739
00:53:12,126 --> 00:53:14,194
Listen up.

740
00:53:14,294 --> 00:53:18,966
On my command, we're going
to make a 90-degree turn

741
00:53:19,067 --> 00:53:20,902
in the next few miles.

742
00:53:21,002 --> 00:53:23,571
On my command, copy?

743
00:53:27,008 --> 00:53:27,709
Let's go.

744
00:53:42,757 --> 00:53:43,390
Thomas.

745
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:43,991
Hi.

746
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,462
I said I would have the money.

747
00:53:48,563 --> 00:53:49,463
I'm going to have the money.

748
00:53:49,564 --> 00:53:50,363
You just have to realize--

749
00:53:50,464 --> 00:53:51,766
Just-- just shut up, OK?

750
00:53:51,866 --> 00:53:54,836
I need an artillery barrage
on grid section 473.

751
00:53:54,936 --> 00:53:56,838
Sure, no problem.

752
00:53:56,938 --> 00:53:57,672
Do you have a--

753
00:53:57,772 --> 00:53:58,773
Authorization.

754
00:54:06,246 --> 00:54:10,084
This is-- this is
not from division.

755
00:54:10,184 --> 00:54:11,318
General Patton.

756
00:54:11,418 --> 00:54:12,887
You want to call
the general yourself?

757
00:54:18,626 --> 00:54:19,961
Everything seems
to be in order.

758
00:54:20,061 --> 00:54:20,862
Yeah, I know.

759
00:54:20,962 --> 00:54:21,763
Everything is in order.

760
00:54:21,863 --> 00:54:23,330
Oh, and one last thing.

761
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:33,306
I wonder how
that got in there.

762
00:54:33,406 --> 00:54:36,144
Yeah, I wonder too.

763
00:54:36,244 --> 00:54:38,913
Well, it's-- it's my money.

764
00:54:39,013 --> 00:54:40,848
Beautiful, beautiful.

765
00:54:40,948 --> 00:54:41,816
Ah, ah.

766
00:54:41,916 --> 00:54:43,651
You know what?

767
00:54:43,751 --> 00:54:44,451
Interest.

768
00:55:19,821 --> 00:55:22,023
Your lady?

769
00:55:22,123 --> 00:55:22,824
Yeah.

770
00:55:29,396 --> 00:55:30,698
Get to this war
and come back to me,

771
00:55:30,798 --> 00:55:33,267
was the last thing
she said to me.

772
00:55:33,366 --> 00:55:35,136
She's beautiful.

773
00:55:35,236 --> 00:55:35,903
Thanks, man.

774
00:55:38,906 --> 00:55:40,007
Lisa.

775
00:55:40,107 --> 00:55:43,511
She wanted to get married
before I shipped out.

776
00:55:43,611 --> 00:55:45,412
I wasn't sure if I'd
make it back home.

777
00:55:45,513 --> 00:55:48,149
You love her?

778
00:55:48,249 --> 00:55:50,718
Yeah, I do.

779
00:55:55,690 --> 00:56:02,630
I um should've never
left you back there.

780
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:04,431
I'm sorry.

781
00:56:04,532 --> 00:56:06,167
What made you
come back for me?

782
00:56:06,267 --> 00:56:07,702
I guess I was
following orders.

783
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:15,042
The name is Hayes, Robert Hayes.

784
00:56:15,142 --> 00:56:16,244
Frank Ross.

785
00:56:16,344 --> 00:56:18,145
Nice to meet you.

786
00:56:18,246 --> 00:56:20,781
Thanks for coming back.

787
00:56:33,261 --> 00:56:36,664
Looks like some sort of repair
station set up in the town

788
00:56:36,764 --> 00:56:37,732
below.

789
00:56:37,832 --> 00:56:40,601
They should be sitting ducks.

790
00:56:40,701 --> 00:56:43,804
We'll go in our
triangle formation, R,

791
00:56:43,905 --> 00:56:46,439
take Blood and go
down to the right.

792
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:48,643
Yucky, you move Alamo
down to the left.

793
00:56:48,743 --> 00:56:50,511
California Love will center.

794
00:57:03,024 --> 00:57:05,326
Looking good, boys.

795
00:57:05,425 --> 00:57:07,862
Keep your eyes wide open.

796
00:57:07,962 --> 00:57:12,066
Any fucking second, those
Krauts could hit us.

797
00:57:29,283 --> 00:57:31,185
Direct
orders from General Patton.

798
00:57:31,285 --> 00:57:35,523
The artillery attack
at Fort at 1900.

799
00:57:35,623 --> 00:57:37,858
Yes sir, yes, sir.

800
00:57:37,959 --> 00:57:42,863
Fire mission, November, golf,
18, 18, fire for a fact.

801
00:57:51,238 --> 00:57:52,406
Hard left.

802
00:57:58,946 --> 00:58:00,881
Fire.

803
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:03,884
Now!

804
00:58:08,389 --> 00:58:09,557
Hard right now.

805
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,294
Fire!

806
00:58:20,267 --> 00:58:20,935
Fire.

807
00:58:27,708 --> 00:58:29,510
Row, aim deeper.

808
00:58:34,415 --> 00:58:35,516
Hard right now.

809
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:39,220
Fire!

810
00:58:42,857 --> 00:58:43,290
Fire.

811
00:58:53,334 --> 00:58:54,902
That one was shot cold.

812
00:59:06,515 --> 00:59:06,847
Call up the shots.

813
00:59:20,928 --> 00:59:22,196
Hayes, we've got company.

814
00:59:27,868 --> 00:59:29,270
When did they get here?

815
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:30,638
Just now.

816
00:59:30,738 --> 00:59:32,306
I don't think they know
we're in here, though.

817
00:59:32,406 --> 00:59:33,107
Time to go.

818
00:59:47,621 --> 00:59:48,589
Over here.

819
00:59:54,628 --> 00:59:55,329
Hey.

820
00:59:55,429 --> 00:59:56,130
Wait here.

821
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:08,609
Sarge, the road's about
15 yards beyond that berg.

822
01:00:08,709 --> 01:00:12,046
I don't see it on the map.

823
01:00:12,146 --> 01:00:13,380
It's there.

824
01:00:13,481 --> 01:00:15,049
Trust me.

825
01:00:15,149 --> 01:00:16,117
You better be right.

826
01:00:19,954 --> 01:00:20,654
Hey.

827
01:00:29,897 --> 01:00:32,967
All commanders, spread out.

828
01:00:33,067 --> 01:00:35,703
Locate and destroy
the enemy tanks.

829
01:01:10,037 --> 01:01:11,238
Major Baker, can you hear me?

830
01:01:11,338 --> 01:01:13,575
Over.

831
01:01:13,674 --> 01:01:14,609
Creasy, can you hear me?

832
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:15,577
Over.

833
01:01:15,676 --> 01:01:17,478
Any luck?

834
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:18,345
Baker, Baker.

835
01:01:18,445 --> 01:01:19,346
No dice, Sarge.

836
01:01:19,446 --> 01:01:20,615
No sign of Creasy?

837
01:01:20,714 --> 01:01:22,216
Not yet.

838
01:01:22,316 --> 01:01:23,217
Hayes check in?

839
01:01:23,317 --> 01:01:25,686
No.

840
01:01:25,786 --> 01:01:27,421
You let me know the
second you hear anything.

841
01:01:27,522 --> 01:01:28,590
Right away, Sergeant.

842
01:01:28,689 --> 01:01:29,624
Baker, baker,
can you hear me?

843
01:01:29,723 --> 01:01:31,358
Over.

844
01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:32,561
Hayes, you out there?
Over.

845
01:01:32,661 --> 01:01:33,360
Hey, hey.

846
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:39,534
Traffic on 473.

847
01:01:39,634 --> 01:01:42,002
Hayes, are you out there?

848
01:01:42,102 --> 01:01:43,304
Red one, red one, come in.

849
01:01:43,404 --> 01:01:44,071
Over.

850
01:01:47,341 --> 01:01:48,375
Red one, red one.

851
01:01:48,475 --> 01:01:49,176
Anyone out there?

852
01:01:49,276 --> 01:01:50,444
Over.

853
01:01:50,545 --> 01:01:51,546
Lieutenant Hayes, is that you?

854
01:01:51,646 --> 01:01:52,880
Salty?

855
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,048
It's
good to hear your voice,

856
01:01:54,148 --> 01:01:55,449
sir, and know
you're still alive.

857
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:59,688
Salty, we're at the old
mill in grid section 4731.

858
01:01:59,787 --> 01:02:03,257
I got one friend with me.

859
01:02:03,357 --> 01:02:04,391
Do you copy?

860
01:02:04,491 --> 01:02:05,793
I repeat.

861
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:08,597
We're located at the old
mill in gird section 4731.

862
01:02:08,697 --> 01:02:11,131
Grid 473, now.

863
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:17,838
We've got to go.

864
01:02:31,252 --> 01:02:32,419
Here and here.

865
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,321
We work our way down this
line, we should locate them.

866
01:02:34,421 --> 01:02:36,190
Well, what about Creasy?

867
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:40,494
I want you to fortify our
position here and wait for him.

868
01:02:40,595 --> 01:02:41,596
Be ready for anything.

869
01:02:41,696 --> 01:02:42,429
You got it.

870
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:43,430
Let's move.

871
01:02:43,531 --> 01:02:44,198
You heard him.

872
01:02:52,707 --> 01:02:54,341
Let's hold here, boys.

873
01:02:54,441 --> 01:02:55,510
Keep your eyes out.

874
01:03:03,284 --> 01:03:04,051
Comb the surface.

875
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:17,532
Shit, shit!

876
01:03:17,632 --> 01:03:18,533
Reverse, reverse!

877
01:03:25,973 --> 01:03:27,041
I'm on the 50.

878
01:03:27,141 --> 01:03:28,242
Cover me.

879
01:03:45,593 --> 01:03:46,594
Son of a bitch.

880
01:04:01,509 --> 01:04:03,243
That doesn't sound good.

881
01:04:03,344 --> 01:04:04,546
No, it don't.

882
01:04:04,646 --> 01:04:06,681
You got the bazooka?

883
01:04:06,781 --> 01:04:08,817
Made sure Ali grabbed it.

884
01:04:08,916 --> 01:04:10,585
Let's get it ready.

885
01:04:10,685 --> 01:04:11,985
We're going to
have some company.

886
01:04:14,656 --> 01:04:15,889
Hey.

887
01:04:15,989 --> 01:04:16,758
Make sure you're going
to grab the bazooka, OK?

888
01:04:16,857 --> 01:04:17,559
Yeah, OK.

889
01:04:32,339 --> 01:04:33,608
Shit.

890
01:04:36,944 --> 01:04:37,478
Come on.

891
01:04:44,786 --> 01:04:45,520
What do you?

892
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:46,353
We can't stay here.

893
01:04:46,453 --> 01:04:47,054
I'll cover you.

894
01:04:47,154 --> 01:04:48,857
Go!

895
01:04:59,066 --> 01:05:01,335
You hear that?

896
01:05:01,435 --> 01:05:02,704
Double time.

897
01:05:02,804 --> 01:05:04,371
Double time, boys.

898
01:05:11,478 --> 01:05:13,548
I'll distract them long
enough for you to get away.

899
01:05:13,648 --> 01:05:14,616
No way.

900
01:05:14,716 --> 01:05:15,550
We're in this together.

901
01:05:17,985 --> 01:05:18,653
Right.

902
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:23,323
Here they come.

903
01:05:23,424 --> 01:05:24,158
Let's do this.

904
01:05:28,863 --> 01:05:30,732
I'm out.

905
01:05:30,832 --> 01:05:33,333
Me too.

906
01:05:33,434 --> 01:05:34,435
Here you go.

907
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:39,406
Shit!

908
01:05:48,115 --> 01:05:50,117
You see anything?

909
01:05:50,217 --> 01:05:51,753
The Germans are
coming down the road.

910
01:05:51,853 --> 01:05:52,486
All right.

911
01:05:52,587 --> 01:05:53,187
Let's get ready.

912
01:05:53,287 --> 01:05:54,321
Let's get ready, guys.

913
01:06:14,208 --> 01:06:15,910
Wait till they pass.

914
01:06:16,009 --> 01:06:17,077
Got it.

915
01:06:25,486 --> 01:06:26,153
Now.

916
01:07:09,531 --> 01:07:10,130
All right.

917
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:11,198
Wait for my signal.

918
01:07:17,037 --> 01:07:19,574
What do you think they're
going to do with us?

919
01:07:19,674 --> 01:07:20,642
I don't know.

920
01:07:33,588 --> 01:07:34,522
I said, get.

921
01:07:48,002 --> 01:07:48,703
Hey!

922
01:07:59,581 --> 01:08:01,983
Wait for it.

923
01:08:02,082 --> 01:08:02,750
Come on.

924
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,188
Come on.

925
01:08:16,898 --> 01:08:18,365
the fuck off of me.

926
01:08:18,465 --> 01:08:18,866
Hey!

927
01:08:18,967 --> 01:08:19,801
Hey!

928
01:08:19,901 --> 01:08:20,668
Please don't do this.

929
01:08:20,768 --> 01:08:21,636
Don't do this, please.

930
01:08:21,736 --> 01:08:22,336
Get off of him.

931
01:08:22,436 --> 01:08:23,136
Hey.

932
01:08:23,236 --> 01:08:24,672
Get the fuck off of me.

933
01:08:24,772 --> 01:08:25,740
Hey, you piece of shit.

934
01:08:34,381 --> 01:08:35,617
That's the best you got?

935
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:43,256
No, no, no, no, no.

936
01:08:43,357 --> 01:08:45,059
Get the fuck off me.

937
01:08:45,192 --> 01:08:46,027
No!

938
01:08:46,126 --> 01:08:48,362
You can't do that to him.

939
01:08:48,462 --> 01:08:50,497
No!

940
01:08:50,598 --> 01:08:52,533
Hands up.

941
01:08:52,634 --> 01:08:53,266
Do it now.

942
01:09:11,552 --> 01:09:11,919
Now!

943
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:12,954
Now!

944
01:09:16,024 --> 01:09:16,824
Now.

945
01:09:19,259 --> 01:09:19,894
Hands up.

946
01:09:23,631 --> 01:09:24,766
I said, hands up.

947
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:03,971
Tie them up.

948
01:10:14,916 --> 01:10:18,218
Thank you, brother.

949
01:10:18,318 --> 01:10:20,220
Thank you.

950
01:10:43,811 --> 01:10:44,812
How are we doing?

951
01:10:44,912 --> 01:10:47,515
It honestly sounds
like we're winning, sir.

952
01:10:47,615 --> 01:10:48,315
All right.

953
01:10:48,415 --> 01:10:49,349
Lieutenant, get me some coffee.

954
01:10:49,449 --> 01:10:51,719
This could take all day.

955
01:10:51,819 --> 01:10:53,386
I'm on it, sir.

956
01:10:53,487 --> 01:10:55,223
We're
holding back a German assault.

957
01:10:55,322 --> 01:10:57,290
I repeat, we're
at-- field and are

958
01:10:57,390 --> 01:11:02,230
holding back a German assault.

959
01:11:02,329 --> 01:11:03,296
Who's this?

960
01:11:03,396 --> 01:11:04,766
Lieutenant Frank Ross.

961
01:11:04,866 --> 01:11:07,201
You must be that pilot
everybody's been looking for.

962
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,604
I guess so.

963
01:11:09,704 --> 01:11:10,972
Here you go.

964
01:11:11,072 --> 01:11:12,240
Thanks.

965
01:11:12,339 --> 01:11:15,009
Let's go.

966
01:11:15,109 --> 01:11:15,710
All right, guys.

967
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:16,911
Listen up.

968
01:11:17,011 --> 01:11:18,813
We're going to take their
weapons and leave them.

969
01:11:18,913 --> 01:11:21,015
And are
holding back a Germany assault.

970
01:11:21,115 --> 01:11:22,183
Set up the mortars.

971
01:11:22,282 --> 01:11:23,618
Hit them with artillery.

972
01:11:23,718 --> 01:11:24,886
Holding
back a German assault.

973
01:11:24,986 --> 01:11:28,089
Sends third platoon
into Go!

974
01:11:28,189 --> 01:11:29,724
We're in-- field

975
01:11:29,824 --> 01:11:31,626
and are holding back
a German assault.

976
01:11:33,528 --> 01:11:35,428
Salty, we're
running out of ammo,

977
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:39,033
and we don't have no rockets.

978
01:11:51,512 --> 01:11:53,413
Sons of bitches.

979
01:11:53,514 --> 01:11:57,985
Creasy, smoke them!

980
01:11:58,085 --> 01:11:59,987
Fire!

981
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:10,565
On my count.

982
01:12:10,665 --> 01:12:11,833
3, 2, 1.

983
01:12:42,196 --> 01:12:43,064
Is that a fucking tank?

984
01:12:50,838 --> 01:12:51,772
Fire.

985
01:12:54,242 --> 01:12:55,776
Fire!

986
01:13:05,253 --> 01:13:06,754
Fire.

987
01:13:06,854 --> 01:13:09,090
Go.

988
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:09,857
Fire!

989
01:13:23,137 --> 01:13:23,838
Get out.

990
01:13:35,616 --> 01:13:36,483
I will finish them myself.

991
01:13:47,995 --> 01:13:48,996
Hell yeah.

992
01:13:49,096 --> 01:13:50,097
Private, look.

993
01:14:00,942 --> 01:14:03,945
Lieutenant,
can't keep this up.

994
01:14:04,045 --> 01:14:05,913
Right.

995
01:14:06,013 --> 01:14:06,814
That's our ride.

996
01:14:25,866 --> 01:14:27,868
It's Hayes!

997
01:14:27,969 --> 01:14:29,270
Hell yeah!

998
01:14:37,244 --> 01:14:39,547
I'll be damned.

999
01:14:39,647 --> 01:14:40,614
Hold your fire.

1000
01:14:46,053 --> 01:14:47,221
Guys, over here.

1001
01:14:49,256 --> 01:14:50,591
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1002
01:14:50,691 --> 01:14:52,193
Where the hell are they?

1003
01:15:00,034 --> 01:15:00,935
Get ready on three.

1004
01:15:05,873 --> 01:15:08,509
Shit.

1005
01:15:08,609 --> 01:15:12,446
We'll draw them out.

1006
01:15:12,546 --> 01:15:14,048
Fire!

1007
01:15:22,423 --> 01:15:23,391
Where is that coming from?

1008
01:15:23,491 --> 01:15:24,625
That was an 88.

1009
01:15:24,725 --> 01:15:26,927
It's hiding in those trees.

1010
01:15:28,729 --> 01:15:29,897
Son of a bitches.

1011
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,068
Fire!

1012
01:15:37,405 --> 01:15:38,706
Take us out of the trees.

1013
01:16:10,271 --> 01:16:12,907
Hell yeah?

1014
01:16:13,007 --> 01:16:13,808
Hell yeah.

1015
01:16:16,610 --> 01:16:17,978
Hell yeah!

1016
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:19,413
Hell yeah!

1017
01:16:19,514 --> 01:16:21,882
Defensive positions, move!

1018
01:16:21,982 --> 01:16:25,019
Go, go, go.

1019
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:25,753
Forward!

1020
01:16:36,263 --> 01:16:36,931
Fire!

1021
01:16:45,639 --> 01:16:46,541
Now!

1022
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:04,959
We'll finish this.

1023
01:17:05,059 --> 01:17:05,759
Forward!

1024
01:17:11,265 --> 01:17:14,503
Red one,
red one, we have visual.

1025
01:17:14,603 --> 01:17:15,803
We are engaging.

1026
01:17:35,389 --> 01:17:36,290
Yeah!

1027
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:37,592
Oh, yeah.

1028
01:17:37,691 --> 01:17:38,392
Woo!

1029
01:17:45,766 --> 01:17:47,502
That was the red tails.

1030
01:17:47,602 --> 01:17:48,637
Red tails?

1031
01:17:48,736 --> 01:17:50,204
Tuskegee airmen.

1032
01:17:50,304 --> 01:17:50,938
Negro pilots.

1033
01:18:18,365 --> 01:18:23,404
Men, you are the first
Negro tankers to ever

1034
01:18:23,505 --> 01:18:25,372
fight in the American army.

1035
01:18:25,472 --> 01:18:30,277
I never would have asked
for you if you weren't good.

1036
01:18:30,377 --> 01:18:35,282
I have nothing but
the best in my army.

1037
01:18:35,382 --> 01:18:40,555
I don't care what color you
are as long as you go up there

1038
01:18:40,655 --> 01:18:43,692
and kill those Kraut
sons of bitches.

1039
01:18:43,791 --> 01:18:48,462
Everyone has their eyes
on you and is expecting

1040
01:18:48,563 --> 01:18:51,198
great things from you.

1041
01:18:51,298 --> 01:18:53,501
Don't let them down.

1042
01:18:53,602 --> 01:18:56,370
And, damn you,
don't let me down.

1043
01:18:59,406 --> 01:19:04,445
They say it is patriotic
to die for your country.

1044
01:19:07,014 --> 01:19:10,719
Well, let's see
how many patriots

1045
01:19:10,818 --> 01:19:14,021
we can make out of those
Germans sons of bitches.

1046
01:19:15,956 --> 01:19:19,393
Detail 910, move.

1047
01:19:19,493 --> 01:19:21,295
At arms.

1048
01:19:29,770 --> 01:19:32,206
We're going, gentlemen.

1049
01:19:32,306 --> 01:19:32,973
Creasy.

1050
01:19:38,279 --> 01:19:39,179
This is him, sir.

1051
01:19:53,961 --> 01:19:57,965
Sergeant Creasy, I
understand from my men

1052
01:19:58,065 --> 01:20:00,901
that if it wasn't for
you, I wouldn't be here.

1053
01:20:07,174 --> 01:20:09,109
Thank you.

1054
01:20:09,209 --> 01:20:09,810
Sure.

1055
01:20:17,818 --> 01:20:18,553
Carry on.

1056
01:20:24,726 --> 01:20:25,359
Thank you.

1057
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:49,850
Everybody, back to work.

1058
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:51,151
Yes, sir.

1059
01:21:05,065 --> 01:21:06,634
Now you look like
a proper officer.

1060
01:21:09,771 --> 01:21:10,938
Looking good.

1061
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:18,847
And that's thanks
to you, Lieutenant.

1062
01:21:18,946 --> 01:21:20,715
They sending you
back to the Air Corps?

1063
01:21:20,815 --> 01:21:24,084
I still got one more
plane to make ace.

1064
01:21:24,184 --> 01:21:27,321
I have no doubt you'll do it.

1065
01:21:27,421 --> 01:21:28,188
I will never forget.

1066
01:21:36,731 --> 01:21:37,799
Take care, brother.

1067
01:21:37,898 --> 01:21:38,633
You too.
