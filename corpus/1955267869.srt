But see, it's 100% Mary-Kate and Ashley.

1026
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:53,115
Props, do you want
these glasses and rings?

1027
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:57,035
I mean, let's face it. They, produced it,
starred in it, they cast it.

1028
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:00,955
- They hired the director and the writers.
- Nice working with you, sweetie.

1029
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:04,920
And who got all the close-ups? Not me.
Who got all the great wardrobe?

1030
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,277
Not me. Who got all the juicy scenes?
Not me.

1031
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:11,876
I got a paper. I got a watch. I got glasses.
The paper's from last Friday.

1032
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:14,270
Who were asked for autographs
for hours a day...

1033
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:17,080
while people just completely ignored me?
Not me!

1034
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:18,514
'Bye, Chris.

1035
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:21,316
'Bye.

1036

- Hey, where's Cliff?
- He went straight to the airport.

1037
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:27,917
- He wanted to get back to his family.
- Seven come 11. Here we go.

1038
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,151
We only have a few minutes
to get to the airport.

1039
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:33,950
Would you relax? I'm making money here.
Here we go. Come on now, guys.

1040
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,271
Working with you guys is so much fun.

1041
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:39,194
I really hope we get to shoot
another picture together.

1042
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:40,999
- Great.
- Thank you.

1043
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:45,193
- We have to get rid of him.
- Why? He was so nice.

1044
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,476
I know, but the director
was furious with him.

1045
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,279
He missed at least a dozen shots.

1046
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:53,149
Big question now is,
where are we gonna shoot our next film?

1047
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,269
The map.

1048
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:03,758
London, Paris, Sydney, the Bahamas.
Now where can we go?

1049
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:08,355
Some place that we love.
Some place that the audience will love.

1050
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:12,038
Wait a minute.
You always get to pick the location.

1051
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:17,070
In fact, you always get to pick the
stories, the cast, and the crew, too.

1052
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:20,478
This time, I'm putting my foot down.
It's my turn.

1053
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:25,157
- Do not take this responsibility lightly.
- I will cherish this moment forever.

Don't tell me you're down for hanging
with Keegan, the bratty daughter...

1056
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:29,596
And Chad and Jill and
their bratty daughter Keegan...

Can we start over again?

1060
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:45,070
- I never liked you.
- So, when should I start my line?

1061
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,516
- I think, you can go ahead and start.
- Right now?

1062
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,478
- Yeah.
- What's my line?

1063
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:52,640
What is it?

1064
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:56,955
Good day. Sorry. Good day.

1065
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,552
So, what kind of fish is this?

1066
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:02,438
This is a spotted...

1067
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:07,074
- I'm on it.
- How late does that make them, Judy?

1068
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:08,389
Tight.

1069
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:12,398
If we were at home,
it would have been 45 minutes.
