That's why we came out here
in the first place.

Look, do not make me beg
because I will, al-- all right,

Why are you climbing this fence?

89
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:45,285
[panting]
Because this is the place
where we stored your stuff.

90
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:47,548
I'll send for it
when I get back.

91

What the hell do I want
with my stuff?

92

What, starving? Sleeping
on the street another night?

Could you imagine
how much edgier
your next script is gonna to be

98
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:10,048
if you-- if you stick
this out, if you draw
from this experience?

99
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:12,964

will be coming from hunger.

Don't do that, Max.

156
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:57,389
We came out here
a couple of months ago.

157
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:00,567
And things didn't quite work out
the way you hoped they would?

As you can see, I got
a lot of people living here.

165
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:26,506
If you guys intend to stay,

166
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:28,072
we're gonna have
to work out a deal.

167
00:08:29,683 --> 00:08:30,901
[panting] What kind of deal?

168
00:08:31,032 --> 00:08:33,513
Don't get hostile with me,
little man.

169
00:08:37,081 --> 00:08:39,388
All depends
on what I think you can afford.

170
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:43,740
I used to be
a janitor in Jersey,

171
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:45,394
before we came out here.

172
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:49,485
Well, then you know
what building maintenance
is all about.

173

We've got a simpatico.

174
00:08:56,318 --> 00:08:57,145
Name is Cliff.

175
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:58,102
Tiger.

176
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:02,150
-This is my partner, Max.
-Hey man, how you doing, man?

177
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,545
You got a funny way about you,
I'm not too sure about you yet.

178
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:07,459
[scoffs]
You ever look in the mirror?

179
00:09:09,026 --> 00:09:10,245
-[Cliff shouts]
-[Max screaming]

180
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,770
-[loud thud]
-[Cliff laughs]

181
00:09:17,905 --> 00:09:19,341
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

182
00:09:22,518 --> 00:09:23,954
Since it's Christmas, you know,

183
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:28,306
I'll let you stay
with your stuff till New Year's,

184
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,745
and then
I'll figure out the money.

185
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,705
-You got the paperwork?
-Lost it.

186
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:37,968
Some identifiable
piece of furniture?

187
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:39,709
A princess bed.

188
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,585
Yeah, I got a princess bed.

189
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,804
Kids.

190
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:54,942
You don't seem like
the princess bed type to me.

191
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,422
Bad marriage.

192
00:09:57,553 --> 00:09:59,163
She took our daughter.

193
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:00,338
[Cliff sighs]

194
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:05,605
Wives. They're bad.

195
00:10:09,304 --> 00:10:10,348
[soft clicks]

196
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,744
This is our largest bin.

197
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:20,097
I was supposed to move
you guys' stuff
to a smaller one,

198
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:24,058
but I never got around to it.

199
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:26,974
[soft dripping]

200
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,630
You guys must be lucky.

201
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:35,199
Well...

202
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,506
...sleep tight.

203
00:10:52,608 --> 00:10:53,565
[loud thud]

204
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:56,090
[loud thud]

205
00:11:22,594 --> 00:11:23,944
Merry Christmas, Tiger.

206
00:11:25,206 --> 00:11:27,817
[singing "O Mio Babbino Caro"]

207
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:39,046
Let's go.

208
00:11:43,572 --> 00:11:46,270
[man]
Hey, over here!

209
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:49,883
You believe this place
is shut down?

210
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:51,972
Only an elf works
on Christmas, right?

211
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:53,974
-[laughs]
-What are you gonna do?

212
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:55,715
-Hi, I'm Arnie Setzer.
-I'm Max.

213
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:57,151
This is Tiger.

214
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:59,022
Hey, listen, I'm glad
Frankie put us together.

215
00:11:59,153 --> 00:12:00,545
Oh, Frankie.

216
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:02,112
Come on, I'm right over here.

217
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:04,375
Hey, you boys hear
about this Costume Killer?

218
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:06,943
Yeah, he just nailed
his fourth victim.

219
00:12:07,074 --> 00:12:08,640
-Christmas Eve, no less.
-[grunts]

220
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:11,643
Uh, some USC co-ed
in her apartment.

221
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:14,255
Holidays and some sick bastard
is out killing people.

222
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:15,909
Uh, welcome to LA, right?

223
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:17,998
I should send him
to see my ex. [laughs]

224
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:20,348
-[laughs]
-So-- so what do you boys got?

225
00:12:20,478 --> 00:12:23,090
Well, we've got
a very hot idea for you.

226
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,482
Well, all it takes is one.

227
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:26,833
One very hot idea
to do the trick, uh?

228
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:29,139
-[high-pitched hiss]
-So go ahead, pitch me.

229
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:30,924
Okay. Um,

230
00:12:31,054 --> 00:12:33,230
-Arnie, it's, uh,
it's like this.
-Uh-huh.

231
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:36,451
Um, I lived under this bridge,

232
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:38,758
and it's called
the Hell Gate Bridge.

233
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:41,064
-[Arnie] Right.
-And it loomed over the lives

234
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:42,413
of all the guys
that lived under it.

235
00:12:42,544 --> 00:12:43,850
This is their story.

236
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,373
Uh-huh.

237
00:12:45,503 --> 00:12:48,028
We open, and one of the guys
is getting married,

238
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:50,073
-but he's got cold feet.
-Right.

239
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:51,988
The girl is a hairdresser
in the neighborhood,

240
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:54,077
and the guy thinks
that if he marries her,

241
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,123
he'll be stuck
in that world forever.

242
00:12:56,253 --> 00:12:58,429
And he's got dreams
of being-- of being a singer

243
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,302
that he's afraid won't come true
if he ties the knot.

244
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:04,784
So the friends, they help
the singer overcome his fears

245
00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:06,916
of-- of who they are,
where they're from,

246
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:08,875
they-- they-- they inspire him

247
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:11,921
-to climb
to the top of the bridge.
-[bird chirping]

248
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:16,578
-That's it?
-[Tiger] That's it.

249
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,710
-Very good.
-Yeah, it's-- it's universal,

250
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,843
-it re-- really is.
-Yeah.

251
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:23,237
I'm gonna level with you.

252
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:26,022
It's, uh, <i>Diner.</i>

253
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:30,331
Yes! Yes, that's it,
exactly! Terrific!

254
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:31,854
No, not "terrific." See, <i>Diner,</i>

255
00:13:31,985 --> 00:13:33,856
no way that movie
gets made today.

256
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:35,815
Yours, same thing,
no way it gets made.

257
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:37,120
And at this point in my career,

258
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:39,122
I-- I need to do things
that get made.

259
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:41,211
Yeah, but-- but <i>Diner</i>got made.

260
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,735
Yeah, but that was then.
See, I need now.

261
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,389
-I-- I need fresh.
-But wait,

262
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,609
when you hear the characters
more specifically,

263
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:49,132
like-- like,
there's this gay character--

264
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:51,134
Kid, kid, do you wanna
get the movie made?

265
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:53,136
Go to Redford,
he can do this kind of thing,

266
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:55,530
but me, I'm the guy
that needs fresh.

267
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,053
I mean, shit, let's face it.

268
00:13:57,184 --> 00:13:59,142
Every story in the world
is already taken.

269
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:01,405
But if you got a fresh thing,
a fresh thing, like,

270
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:04,582
like, uh, for example,
fresh pasta, right?

271
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:06,758
It's better
than not fresh pasta, right?

272
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,978
Fresh fish, fresh flowers,

273
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:11,372
fresh bread, it's--
it's all better than not fresh.

274
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:14,462
I'm telling you this
and I'm not blowing
smoke up your colon.

275
00:14:14,592 --> 00:14:17,334
You find me fresh,
I can get the De Niro,

276
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:20,120
I can do that. That's--
that's-- that's my guarantee.

277
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:22,383
Look, here's
how you can reach me.

278
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:24,559
I'm a hard worker
and I don't bullshit around.

279
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,257
You give me
the right ammunition,

280
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:30,304
-I'm your pit bull.
What do I need?
-Fresh!

281
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:31,479
-Fresh.
-[Arnie] Right.

282
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:33,002
And not too long, okay?

283
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:35,526
I mean, if you can get me
something by New Year's Eve,

284
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:36,788
I might be able
to get the money.

285
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:39,443
Look, I gotta brush.

286
00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:43,795
Fresh.

This is my last
illegal act, Max.

293
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,117
[Max]
Yeah, sure, great.

294
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:02,640
Hey, grab the newspaper,

295
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:04,816
it's a great place
to find story ideas.

-"Costume Killer
claims fifth victim."
-[groans]

297
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,435
It's that serial killer
Arnie was telling us about.

298
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:17,917
Christmas Eve
and Christmas night.

299
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:19,440
This time a man, put him in a...

...rich-looking velvet
smoking jacket

301

and a silk ascot, and filled him
with window cleaner?

Uh, guy's been busy
like we should be.

304

Come on, let's get back to work.

305
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:36,370
Come on.

306
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,938
[groans] Oh! [gasps]

307
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:41,505
-Horrible.
-Come on!

00:15:57,347 --> 00:15:58,131
Thanks for letting me read
your screenplay, man,

313
00:15:58,261 --> 00:15:59,045
it's wonderful.

314
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:01,569
Yeah, I guess. Thanks.

315
00:16:02,135 --> 00:16:03,136
Well, um,

316
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:07,488
I just wanted to let you know
that I appreciate what you do.

317
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,317
Being original, I mean.

318
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:13,842
I-- I know how hard
that can be, because...

319
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:16,540
...well, anyway, I--

320
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:19,021
I just-- I just know.

321

324
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,990
-Oh, you like that?
-Yeah.

a load of this, Pilgrim.

-You could tell?
-Of course I can tell.

God, you've got talent, Cliff.

329
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,043
Thanks, thanks.

330
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:43,480
I'll see you later.

331
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,265
You get back to work now.

[woman singing
"O Mio Babbino Caro"]

333
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:24,478
Man, Arnie gives us
a challenge and we fall apart.

334
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:28,090
How hard can it be to come up
with something fresh, anyway?

335
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:31,354
Obviously very hard.

336
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:32,964
What do you think
we've been doing?

337
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,402
I need a break, I need air.

338
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:38,187
Yeah, well, you know,
come up with a twist
to your heartfelt script

339
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:39,623
and you can have
all the air you want.

340
00:17:39,754 --> 00:17:40,972
What about you?
What do you think

all those stupid magazines

on what's hip in this town.

345
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:49,155
[sniffs] I'm doing research.

346
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:51,461
[grunts] All right, come on.

347
00:17:51,592 --> 00:17:54,377
Just throw one at me, pitch me.

348
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:56,205
What about the great bear hunt?

349
00:17:56,336 --> 00:17:58,425
A group of guys go
on a hunting trip

350
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,601
and turn on each other.

351
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:01,950
Why do they turn?

352
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,647
Because one guy finds out

353
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:06,128
that another guy on the trip
is sleeping with his wife.

354
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:09,914
And?

355
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:12,352
And he freaks out!

356
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:15,442
Instead of hunting bears,
they start hunting each other!

357
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,271
Man, this is tough.

358
00:18:18,401 --> 00:18:20,229
-[high-pitch buzz]
-[Tiger] What the--

359
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,101
-[Max] What happened?
-How am I supposed to work

360
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:23,972
in this place? It's a dungeon.
Now we got no light.

361
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,843
-[distant shouts]
-[Max] Come on, let's--
let's just go talk

362
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:27,541
to your janitor friend.
I can't believe

363
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:28,977
you let him read your script.

364
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,022
-[woman] <i>...back on!</i>
-[man] <i>Hey!</i>

365
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:33,286
[ominous music]

366
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:37,028
[panting]

367
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:39,944
[thuds]

368
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:41,032
[Tiger]
Cliff?

369
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:42,904
-[knocks on door]
-[soft rattling]

370
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:43,818
Cliff?

371
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:46,560
Cliff?

372
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:49,084
He's not home. [sighs]

373
00:18:50,955 --> 00:18:52,174
[deeply exhales]

374
00:18:52,783 --> 00:18:54,002
Maybe there's a switch.

375
00:18:54,655 --> 00:18:55,743
[Max]
A switch?

376
00:18:56,396 --> 00:18:58,398
[suspenseful music]

377
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:06,275
Oh, hey.

378
00:19:07,363 --> 00:19:08,538
here we go.

379
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:12,934
[Max]
What a load of crap.

380
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:14,370
[Tiger]
Up here.

381
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:18,418
There we go. Maybe
it's a fuse box or-- yeah.

382
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:21,160
[Max]
Fuse box, fuse-- uh...

383
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,727
That's weird.

384
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,080
Window cleaner...
[sighs] plenty of it.

385
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:31,170
[Tiger]
Yeah.

386
00:19:31,822 --> 00:19:33,259
-[Max] Oh.
-Over here.

387
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:34,695
Huh?

388
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:38,394
[Tiger]
Oh my God.

389
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:42,006
-It's him.
-[whisper] Cliff is
the Costume Killer?

390
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:43,399
Is it possible?

391
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,881
This is his... lair.

392
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,666
[Max]
That Hannibal Lecter guy.

393
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:53,017
Max, put that down. We're going.

394
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:56,064
Max, put that down, we're going!

395
00:19:56,673 --> 00:19:58,327
Max, put that down, we're going!

396
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,938
-[soft rattling]
-[footsteps receding]

397
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:02,026
[loud thud]

398
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:03,463
[soft rattling]

399
00:20:03,593 --> 00:20:05,552
[ominous music]

400
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,041
-Plastic bags, window cleaner?
-Yeah.

401
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:19,000
Unbelievable.
What else could go wrong?

402
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,220
-What else?
-W-- where are we going?

403
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:24,353
To the police, to let them know
who the serial killer is.

404
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:26,094
Wait, fresh!

405
00:20:26,964 --> 00:20:29,532
This is what Arnie was talking
about, this is fresh.

406
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:31,447
Serial killers are not fresh.

407
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:34,450
Besides, this isn't an idea,
Max, this is real.

408
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:35,886
You're not using your head.

409
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:37,888
You and the guy
have a simpatico.

410
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:41,240
He's a janitor,
you're a janitor.

411
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,545
It's obvious the guy likes you.

412
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:44,721
Great, I'll write to him
on death row.

413
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:46,854
Tiger, think, please.

414
00:20:46,984 --> 00:20:51,467
It's fresh because we will
actually have the guy.

415
00:20:51,598 --> 00:20:53,208
Have him? How will we have him?

416
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:56,298
We will have him to observe him,

417
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:02,217
to tap into his story with him
from his point of view.

418
00:21:02,913 --> 00:21:06,308
The POV from the other side
of the plastic bag.

419
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:07,875
That's fresh!

420
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:10,312
No, no, that's accessory!

421
00:21:13,576 --> 00:21:14,795
Tiger, wait.

422
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:16,623
Tiger, wait.

423
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:19,713
Do you think Shakespeare
didn't know who Hamlet was?

424
00:21:19,843 --> 00:21:22,281
Hamlet was a killer.
He-- he killed several.

425
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:25,109
And Shakespeare knew him.
He knew Hamlet.

426
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,764
He probably sat in a pub
and had beers with him,

427
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:29,200
learned from him,

428
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:31,246
knew his innermost thoughts
and his dreams,

429
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:33,248
and he set them down on paper.

430
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:36,164
I don't know what it is you're
thinking we should do with him.

431
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,080
We'll approach him,
tell him what we know,

432
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,952
and ask him to give us
the exclusive on his life story.

433
00:21:42,605 --> 00:21:45,042
How are we going to involve
a serial killer

434
00:21:45,173 --> 00:21:46,783
in the creative process?

435
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:49,090
[siren howling]

436
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:51,353
It's his story.

437
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:53,834
You're the writer.

438
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:56,706
He's gonna supply the story,

439
00:21:57,533 --> 00:22:00,188
and I'll get Arnie
to jump through hoops.
This will be the freshest thing

440
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,277
he's ever heard
in his entire life.

441
00:22:03,234 --> 00:22:05,019
But we gotta take this shot.

442
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:07,630
Why should we let this thing
go out into the cosmos

443
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:09,589
to be exploited
a million ways till Tuesday,

444
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:12,461
which it will,
and not be involved?

445
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:16,378
Why not control the quality?

446
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:18,554
[light dramatic music]

447
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:22,341
Why not let someone
with your heart tell this story?

448
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:25,909
[whispers] He'll love that.

449
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:30,697
-And if he doesn't?
-[sighs]

450
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:33,090
Then we'll turn him in.
See it's-- it's easy,

451
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:34,831
we're not gonna let
anything go wrong.

452
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:37,225
[siren howling in distance]

453
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,010
Look, I don't want this guy
out on the streets

454
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:42,273
killing any more than you do,

455
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:44,667
but we gotta grab
this opportunity now.

456
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:49,368
[whispering]
If we don't, we may regret
this for the rest of our lives.

457
00:22:50,107 --> 00:22:52,719
-[soft clack]
-[helicopter blades humming]

458
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:55,243
[soft thuds]

459
00:22:57,463 --> 00:23:00,291
Cliff, there's something
I need to tell you.

460
00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:03,251
Me and Max, we went up
to your place last night.

461
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,557
The lights went out, and--

462
00:23:05,688 --> 00:23:06,994
I have to be honest
with you, Cliff,

463
00:23:07,124 --> 00:23:08,822
because it's the only thing
I know how to do.

464
00:23:09,692 --> 00:23:11,607
I sensed that about you, Tiger.

465
00:23:11,738 --> 00:23:15,785
We saw the room where you keep
all those mementos.

466
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:17,657
[soft rattles]

467
00:23:20,311 --> 00:23:21,835
You went into my private room?

468
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:23,489
If I had seen the private sign,

469
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:25,534
I never would've entered,
I swear.

470
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:27,493
But you did.

471
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,366
So, what do you want from me?

472
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:34,369
Well, what I need--

473
00:23:36,023 --> 00:23:40,941
Are you or are you not
the Costume Killer?

474
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:43,378
What are you offering if I am?

475
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:45,424
To write, with your permission,

476
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:47,817
your life story as a movie.

477
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:52,126
Boy, the script you did,
living under the bridge,

478
00:23:52,605 --> 00:23:53,910
not feeling like you're enough,

479
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,087
-I related, man.
-Exactly my point.

480
00:23:57,218 --> 00:23:59,829
Cliff, someone's gonna wind up
telling your story.

481
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,006
Why not let it be me and Max
so you have some control?

482
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,315
What the hell
is he got to do with it?

483
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:09,622
-There are a lot
of decisions to make...
-[grunting]

484
00:24:09,752 --> 00:24:11,493
...what to keep in the script,
what to take out,

485
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:14,453
and you'll see,
Max will be very helpful.

486
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:19,327
[panting] Boy,
we're being very polite
about this, aren't we?

487
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,722
I mean, considering
the subject matter?

488
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:28,336
[grunts] This Costume Killer
does horrible, horrible things.

489
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,469
[panting]

490
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:32,514
Injects his victims
with window cleaner,

491
00:24:33,297 --> 00:24:35,865
then puts
weird costumes on them,

492
00:24:35,996 --> 00:24:37,693
and plastic bags
over their heads,

493
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:41,349
-then asphyxiates them.
-[Tiger] No, you're right,
there's--

494
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,133
there's nothing polite about it.

495
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,875
We'd like the right
to explore that behavior,

496
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:48,051
if you really are the guy.

497
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,143
[shouting] I'm really the guy,
you rug sucker!

498
00:24:54,057 --> 00:24:56,407
I'm your goddamn Costume Killer!

499
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,714
You can bet
your scrawny ass on that!

500
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:01,804
I came out here
for the same thing
everybody does.

501
00:25:02,762 --> 00:25:05,634
Till I find out that
they tore down that pharmacy.

502
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:09,116
What was the, uh--

503
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,206
[indistinct]

504
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:16,079
What was the name?

505
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:17,733
[shouts] God!

506
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,909
What was the name?

507
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,302
Tell me!

508
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:22,999
What was the name
of that goddamn--

509
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:27,874
Hey, tell you what.

510
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:29,745
You tell me the name
of this goddamn pharmacy,

511
00:25:29,876 --> 00:25:31,138
you've got yourselves a story.

512
00:25:31,268 --> 00:25:32,095
Uh, uh, shit.

513
00:25:32,226 --> 00:25:34,054
Uh, uh, Thrifty.

514
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:35,708
Uh, Woolworths.

515
00:25:35,838 --> 00:25:37,579
-CVS! Sav-On!
-Uh, Rite Aid!

516
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,146
-[grunts]
-Genovese?

517
00:25:39,276 --> 00:25:40,887
Here's a hint. Somebody famous

518
00:25:41,017 --> 00:25:42,236
was discovered there.

519
00:25:42,366 --> 00:25:45,761
Oh, oh! Uh, uh, uh,
James Dean, right?

520
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,546
No, stupid.

521
00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:49,373
You stupid fag!

522
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,724
Maybe I ought to kill you!

523
00:25:51,854 --> 00:25:53,943
Wait, Cliff, um, guy or girl?

524
00:25:54,074 --> 00:25:54,901
Girl.

525
00:25:55,945 --> 00:25:57,556
You're lucky he's your partner,

526
00:25:57,686 --> 00:25:59,558
otherwise you'd be
wearing a plastic bag.

527
00:25:59,688 --> 00:26:01,777
-Harlow. Dietrich.
-No. No.

528
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:05,302
I got it.
[shouts] Lana Turner, Swabs!

529
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:06,565
[shouts] Swabs, bingo!

530
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:07,696
Bingo.

531
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:11,004
[Cliff]
Lana Turner.

532
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:14,964
Yeah. Beautiful.

533
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:18,838
Lana Turner was
discovered at Swabs,

534
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:23,407
and nothing is the same since
they tore down that pharmacy.

535
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:26,628
Nobody like Lana Turner

536
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:28,761
could ever be discovered
there again.

537
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:33,592
This used to be a town,
now it's a parking lot.

538
00:26:33,722 --> 00:26:34,810
Valet everything.

539
00:26:35,376 --> 00:26:37,204
Park your car at the state line.

540
00:26:38,422 --> 00:26:41,730
Sure, I like Nicholson. Why not?

541
00:26:44,994 --> 00:26:46,561
This town used to have class.

542
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:50,173
Used to be room
in this town for a guy like me.

543
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,005
Oh, there still is, Cliff.

544
00:26:57,137 --> 00:26:59,052
There still is.

545
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:02,098
[upbeat jazz music]

546
00:27:02,229 --> 00:27:04,666
-[Max] Arnie, hey!
-Oh yeah, good, hi, hi, hi.

547
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:06,450
Come on.

548
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:10,541
[groans] Closed.

549
00:27:11,717 --> 00:27:14,458
Damn, these holidays,
I'm trying to make
a living here.

550
00:27:14,589 --> 00:27:16,286
All right, come on,
come here, come here.

551
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:19,594
Now look, uh,
I got your message.

552
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,945
Man, does anybody else
know about this?

553
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:24,077
No, of course not.

554
00:27:24,207 --> 00:27:24,991
And he is...

555
00:27:26,035 --> 00:27:27,863
-...he is who you say he is?
-W--

556
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:29,343
what are you offering if he is?

557
00:27:29,473 --> 00:27:32,041
Oh, you kids, you kids.

558
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:34,217
You brought me
a truck full of risks.

559
00:27:34,348 --> 00:27:37,786
Moral risks, legal risks,
dollar, fiscal, economic.

560
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:39,875
Help me, I'm stuck,
my Freudian skirt is showing.

561
00:27:40,006 --> 00:27:42,573
I mean, sure, sure,
I wanna make a buck,

562
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:44,663
but why art versus commerce?

563
00:27:44,793 --> 00:27:46,752
Why not make them friends?
Maybe they'll get along,

564
00:27:46,882 --> 00:27:49,493
-we'll win a prize, we'll have--
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

565
00:27:50,494 --> 00:27:51,931
Just tell us
what you're offering.

566
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,630
All right, come here.
Walk with me. Walk with me.

567
00:27:56,196 --> 00:27:59,373
It's the quality of this project
that attracts me,

568
00:27:59,503 --> 00:28:01,854
and quality comes with problems,
everybody knows it.

569
00:28:01,984 --> 00:28:04,247
That's why there's no quality
in this fucking town.

570
00:28:04,378 --> 00:28:06,119
You ever notice that?
That's why.

571
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:07,947
If there's a message,
there's risks.

572
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:11,124
And what else is art
but a series of risks.

573
00:28:11,254 --> 00:28:13,256
And the artist,
the guy willing to take them.

574
00:28:13,387 --> 00:28:15,128
Hey, just answer the question.

575
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:18,566
[deeply sighs]
All right, here's what I offer.

576
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:20,699
The money, okay? The money.

577
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:23,266
All of it, full finance,
one-stop shopping.

578
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:27,618
-How can you be so sure?
-Because this is
the hottest thing in town.

579
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:31,231
Based on a true story?
They bleed for this sort
of thing out here, they bleed.

580
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:33,407
-[Max] So when do we start?
-As soon as I get proof.

581
00:28:33,537 --> 00:28:34,625
[Tiger]
How are we gonna do that?

582
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:36,018
How the hell
am I supposed to know?

583
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:37,454
But do it, and we'll
move on to the money guy.

584
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:38,717
Yeah, I don't think
we can do that.

585
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:39,892
Oh, of course you can,
sure you can.

586
00:28:40,022 --> 00:28:41,894
And soon.
Time is of the essence.

587
00:28:44,853 --> 00:28:48,422
Where's he going?
What is the story with this guy?

588
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:50,816
-How are we supposed
to get proof?
-Man, he can't even buy us

589
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:52,774
a cup of coffee? Yeah, how come

590
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:54,863
every place we're supposed
to meet this guy is closed?

591
00:28:54,994 --> 00:28:57,692
-How do we get proof?
-Does he even own a car?

592
00:28:58,388 --> 00:29:00,739
[sighs] We're gonna have
to follow him.

593
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:01,783
Who, Arnie?

594
00:29:01,914 --> 00:29:03,306
No, Cliff.

595
00:29:03,437 --> 00:29:04,394
Follow Cliff?

596
00:29:04,525 --> 00:29:05,526
Yeah.

597
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:06,919
You think Arnie
and the money guy

598
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:09,225
are gonna take our word
for it as witnesses?

599
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:10,966
Never.

600
00:29:12,228 --> 00:29:13,926
Maybe we could tape record him.

601
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:16,189
Oh, I see.
We wait until he kills again

602
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:18,931
and then we tape record
the sounds of him killing?

603
00:29:19,061 --> 00:29:20,802
I don't think
that's a very-- wait.

604
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:22,891
Oh, I got it, I got it!

Hey, my video camera!

[sharp grunts]

612
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,410
He seems like such
a focused individual.

613
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:07,588
Which I imagine you got to be
in order to do what he does.

614
00:30:07,718 --> 00:30:10,330
Man, what I'd do to have
a handgun right now.

615
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,984
Come on, little fucker!

616
00:30:12,636 --> 00:30:14,377
[Max]
Why don't you take
the lead on this?

617
00:30:14,508 --> 00:30:16,292
The guy just
doesn't care for me.

618
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:19,730
No, that's true, he doesn't.

619
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:22,821
-[grunting]
-Why do we have
to be so disagreeable?

620
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:27,303
I'll stop now.
Just say the word, Max.

621
00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:29,175
Oh, no, no. I'm all right.

622
00:30:29,305 --> 00:30:30,567

-Fuck you!

ain't a horror flick,

-that's what we want
our audience to feel.

that great from here.

-[Tiger] I'm going in.
-Don't be a hero.

651
00:32:23,463 --> 00:32:25,247
I just need a good angle
and then we're done.

00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:28,424
[Tiger]
I thought I could handle this,
but now I know.

00:32:29,077 --> 00:32:31,514
-I think I'm gonna be sick.
-Oh no, you're gonna be fine,

yo-- you're gonna be fine,
all right?

655
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:35,997
Just hang in there.
Now give me a hand.

656
00:32:36,128 --> 00:32:38,565
I can't quite aim this.
Oh, I got it.

657
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:41,046
Got it.

He hasn't done anything yet.

00:34:01,865 --> 00:34:03,867
I'm a directing student at USC.

688
00:34:04,955 --> 00:34:06,131
[softly scoffs]

689
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:10,352
Hey, cheer up, guys!

690
00:34:10,483 --> 00:34:12,920
-You're heroes.
-That's right.

691
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,574
I mean, if Cliff
really was the killer,

692
00:34:14,704 --> 00:34:17,055
then you were willing
to risk your lives to save Ivan.

693
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:20,232
Who is Ivan?

694
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:23,496
Ivan, the actor
playing the victim.

695
00:34:23,626 --> 00:34:25,150
[Max]
Oh, yeah.

696
00:34:25,759 --> 00:34:26,803
Very convincing.

697
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:29,328
[Tiger]
And so are you, Cliff.

698
00:34:30,024 --> 00:34:32,592
And that doesn't just happen
by accident, you know.

699
00:34:32,722 --> 00:34:35,073
He worked very hard
at researching this role.

700
00:34:35,682 --> 00:34:38,554
That explains
the press clippings. [sighs]

701
00:34:40,034 --> 00:34:43,820
Hey, Nikki demands
reality, Tiger.

702
00:34:44,517 --> 00:34:46,345
But I gotta tell you,
man, this was better

703
00:34:46,475 --> 00:34:48,564
than any acting class
I could've ever taken

704
00:34:48,695 --> 00:34:52,351
because one minute
I'm doing research

705
00:34:52,481 --> 00:34:54,527
about a serial killer
and the next minute,

706
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:56,877
bam! I'm cast.

707
00:34:57,704 --> 00:35:00,098
I haven't felt this good
about my work in a long time.

708
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:02,622
[crickets softly chirping]

709
00:35:02,752 --> 00:35:05,581
What I wanna know is
why were you guys running around

710
00:35:05,712 --> 00:35:08,106
-filming the Costume Killer?
-[Cliff] Yeah.

711
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:13,111
We were getting proof that
Cliff was who he said he was.

712
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:15,330
-[soft clatter]
-I thought you believed me.

713
00:35:15,461 --> 00:35:16,723
[Max]
We believed you,

714
00:35:16,853 --> 00:35:19,726
it's just that the guy
we hooked up with,

715
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:22,424
who is interested
in financing the picture,

716
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:25,210
he just wanted some proof
from us that you were

717
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,603
-who you said you were.
-[sharp thud]

718
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:29,779
[chuckling]
Oh, and I thought I was brave.

719
00:35:30,824 --> 00:35:31,825
Jesus.

720
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:33,914
-And you're the writer?
-Yeah.

721
00:35:34,393 --> 00:35:36,917
I'm Tiger. Max is my partner.

722
00:35:37,047 --> 00:35:40,312
Yeah, Max is, uh,
the idea man. [snorts]

723
00:35:41,313 --> 00:35:43,489
[Nikki]
Tiger. That's a fun name.

724
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:47,406
-Thank you.
-So you guys
got money on the line?

725
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:49,059
Not now, we don't.

726
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:52,106
-Why not?
-What do you mean, why not?

727
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,283
Look, we needed to have
the real killer.

728
00:35:55,414 --> 00:35:57,764
You need real,
make real. Create it.

729
00:35:57,894 --> 00:35:58,982
[scoffs]

730
00:35:59,113 --> 00:36:00,288
Now that'd be brave.

731
00:36:00,419 --> 00:36:01,202
How?

732
00:36:02,682 --> 00:36:04,510
I'm sure what you've already got
on that camera of yours

733
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,687
is probably good enough to scare
the shit out of this producer,

734
00:36:07,817 --> 00:36:10,690
but if you need more, you could
piece something together.

735
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:12,866
Piece together what?

736
00:36:13,432 --> 00:36:14,389
The rest of the killing.

737
00:36:15,695 --> 00:36:17,914
You guys got up to what,
the syringe part, right?

738
00:36:18,524 --> 00:36:20,482
-Yeah, I got that.
-Perfect.

739
00:36:20,613 --> 00:36:22,267
Just set up the shot
that you need to cover

740
00:36:22,397 --> 00:36:24,051
what happened after you came in

741
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,184
and splice it together
with what you already have.

742
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:28,360
And then you can tell
this guy of yours

743
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,927
that you not only have
the Costume Killer,

744
00:36:31,058 --> 00:36:33,843
but you managed to keep him
from killing victim number six.

745
00:36:33,974 --> 00:36:36,106
-[chuckles]
-[Tiger] But we could
never do that.

746
00:36:36,803 --> 00:36:39,806
Well, I could.

747
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:43,113
I've got
all the editing equipment
you need to use at school.

748
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:44,463
Okay.

749
00:36:48,554 --> 00:36:51,296
That's a very sweet offer,
but what's in it for you?

750
00:36:52,297 --> 00:36:56,039
[chuckles] I don't know,
you figure it out,
you're the idea guy.

751
00:36:57,867 --> 00:36:59,217
Tiger is a writer.

752
00:36:59,826 --> 00:37:01,001
Cliff is an actor.

753
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:04,047
You already have a producer.

754
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,746
Sounds like
you're missing one thing.

755
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:09,227
A director.

756
00:37:10,924 --> 00:37:13,187
It'd be nice to have
that support from you guys.

757
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:16,973
[upbeat jazz music]

758
00:37:17,974 --> 00:37:19,237
Oh, I'll Mace you!

759
00:37:20,107 --> 00:37:22,370
You guys, you guys,
do you know where we are?

760
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:24,590
I mean, I know you're
from out of town, but please,

761
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,896
do not ask me to come east
of the tar pits, okay?

762
00:37:27,027 --> 00:37:29,072
-This place is Shitsville,
you know what I'm saying--
-I--

763
00:37:29,203 --> 00:37:31,074
I haven't heard a word
of gratitude from you

764
00:37:31,205 --> 00:37:32,337
regarding our video.

765
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:35,514
-Oh, your video? Ooh, yes.
-Yeah.

766
00:37:36,602 --> 00:37:38,908
-Your video was
some very fresh stuff.
-Yeah.

767
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:41,607
-I nearly passed out
from the freshness.
-Okay, so, are you ready?

768
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:44,174
-Hey, that's why I'm here.
I need to meet the guy.
-Okay.

769
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:46,307
-Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
-[Max] What does it look like?

770
00:37:46,438 --> 00:37:49,092
What are we doing?
You guys are some natural
born killers, or what?

771
00:37:49,223 --> 00:37:52,095
-Come on!
-We gonna play pin the tail
on the donkey, huh, huh?

772
00:37:52,226 --> 00:37:54,184
-Where's the pinata?
-Just be quiet.

773
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:55,925
What do I do,
spin around three times fast?

774
00:37:56,056 --> 00:37:57,449
No, no, you just relax,
all right?

775
00:37:58,450 --> 00:37:59,451
[whooshing]

776
00:38:09,983 --> 00:38:10,984
[deeply exhales]

777
00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:15,467
So, you kill.

778
00:38:17,512 --> 00:38:18,470
Yeah.

779
00:38:20,776 --> 00:38:21,864
I like your intensity.

780
00:38:21,995 --> 00:38:23,475
Thank you.

781
00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:24,693
You got a great--

782
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:27,261
a great quality.

783
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:29,481
You ever think about a career?

784
00:38:30,264 --> 00:38:32,048
-Oh, yeah.
-I could see that, you know,

785
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:33,746
I... [stutters] I could see.

786
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:37,358
So, I was thinking
maybe we should get
to know one another

787
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:42,145
since, uh, well,
I'm thinking of selling you.

788
00:38:43,408 --> 00:38:45,323
Know your product.

789
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,195
Exactly.

790
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:51,764
I'm just fundamentally
misunderstood.

791
00:38:51,894 --> 00:38:53,069
[Arnie]
Oh, I could see that.

792
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,941
Don't ask me why.

793
00:38:55,071 --> 00:38:57,900
-Well, that's what w--
-Maybe it's the way
I part my hair.

794
00:38:58,031 --> 00:39:00,338
-That's what we--
-Maybe it's the color
of my eyes.

795
00:39:00,468 --> 00:39:02,035
Well, that's
what we're here to discover.

796
00:39:02,165 --> 00:39:03,341
What?

797
00:39:03,471 --> 00:39:05,778
The source of the mystery.

798
00:39:05,908 --> 00:39:11,087
You know, uh, wha-- what makes
a mystery a mystery, as in, uh,

799
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:13,525
what's it all about?

800
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:15,918
Human nature.

801
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:18,268
Ah, now you see.

802
00:39:18,965 --> 00:39:21,141
-I got nature, man.
-Yeah, I can see that.

803
00:39:21,271 --> 00:39:22,185
-I'm not simple.
-No.

804
00:39:22,316 --> 00:39:24,013
I don't just kill for kicks.

805
00:39:24,623 --> 00:39:25,667
[loud rattling]

806
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,582
I'm not that type.

807
00:39:27,713 --> 00:39:28,888
I've known that type...

808
00:39:29,018 --> 00:39:31,238
-Right. No.
-...but I'm not that type.

809
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,849
I'm different. I'm special.

810
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,763
Right

811
00:39:34,894 --> 00:39:35,677
Huh?

812
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,899
What? Okay.

813
00:39:42,684 --> 00:39:44,033
Okay.

814
00:39:44,164 --> 00:39:45,339
No.

815
00:39:48,342 --> 00:39:49,474
I'm special.

816
00:39:49,604 --> 00:39:51,258
I like the way you think.

817
00:39:51,824 --> 00:39:54,392
I like your socks, man.
You got nice socks.

818
00:39:54,522 --> 00:39:56,045
Oh, yeah, thank you.

819
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:59,266
So, you're observant, too.

820
00:40:00,746 --> 00:40:01,660
[Cliff]
Oh, yeah.

821
00:40:04,445 --> 00:40:06,404
-Let's talk.
-We're talking.

822
00:40:07,143 --> 00:40:09,015
Right, but let's talk,

823
00:40:09,145 --> 00:40:11,539
talk-talk business,
to sell, how to sell.

824
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,802
Hav-- have you-- have you
ever thought about that?

825
00:40:15,282 --> 00:40:17,110
I told you I don't
just kill for kicks.

826
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,720
Oh, you're a sensitive guy.

827
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:19,721
I'm fucked up.

828
00:40:19,852 --> 00:40:21,419
Oh, but you're sensitive.

829
00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:22,768
I never got what I wanted.

830
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:26,641
I never got what I deserved.

831
00:40:26,772 --> 00:40:29,427
I was passed over.

832
00:40:29,557 --> 00:40:32,386
And, uh,
and that's why you kill?

833
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:34,823
That's why I came to Hollywood.

834
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:39,219
Middle of this country
fucked me up.

835
00:40:40,873 --> 00:40:42,396
Hollywood cured me.

836
00:40:42,962 --> 00:40:45,051
Now I kill.

837
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:48,141
Now I'm worth something.

838
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:51,144
-Aren't I?
-[Arnie] Huh?

839
00:40:53,668 --> 00:40:54,495
Worth something.

840
00:40:54,626 --> 00:40:56,149
-Absolutely.
-Good.

841
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,326
Glad we understand one another.

842
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,719
These boys,
they're working hard for you.

843
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:02,068
-I like them.
-Oh, they like you.

844
00:41:02,198 --> 00:41:03,896
I like them. You think?

845
00:41:04,026 --> 00:41:08,509
-Yeah, yeah.
-Because I'm always afraid
I turn people off.

846
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,425
-No way, Jose.
-"I guess I'm just insecure."

847
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:14,559
Oh, no, hey, hey,
who isn't, right?

848
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:16,778
I'm insecure. [panting]

849
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:18,432
You don't think I'm insecure?

850
00:41:22,088 --> 00:41:23,524
I like you, Arnold.

851
00:41:23,655 --> 00:41:26,005
Hey, hey, you know what?

852
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:28,616
[deeply exhale]

853
00:41:28,747 --> 00:41:30,488
This is nice.

854
00:41:31,271 --> 00:41:33,665
-You're really a nice guy.
-You think?

855
00:41:33,795 --> 00:41:36,145
A--- absolutely.
A-- and-- and hey,

856
00:41:36,276 --> 00:41:38,670
if you don't mind
my saying this,

857
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,501
this-- this costume stuff,
the-- don't do it anymore.

858
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:46,678
You know, when you're
in a deal and you're
working on things, uh,

859
00:41:47,287 --> 00:41:49,811
i-- you don't wanna--
it gets sloppy.

860
00:41:49,942 --> 00:41:52,858
You don't what I'm saying?
I mean, you did your job,
now let us do ours.

861
00:41:53,598 --> 00:41:55,730
Give yourself a rest.
You deserve a break.

862
00:41:56,818 --> 00:41:59,429
-You really mean that?
-Would I say it
if I didn't mean it?

863
00:42:02,171 --> 00:42:03,216
I love you, man.

864
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:06,611
[crying] Jesus, Arn!

865
00:42:08,177 --> 00:42:09,352
What?

866
00:42:12,007 --> 00:42:13,574
I love you, too, man.

867
00:42:13,705 --> 00:42:15,402
Oh, hey.

868
00:42:16,055 --> 00:42:16,882
No.

869
00:42:20,146 --> 00:42:21,060
[crying]

870
00:42:21,669 --> 00:42:23,018
Are we in agreement?

871
00:42:28,763 --> 00:42:30,025
Let's make a movie.

872
00:42:30,635 --> 00:42:33,246
I love this guy,
I'm telling you, boys.

873
00:42:33,376 --> 00:42:36,902
This-- this is, you know,
like a living, breathing
project, don't you think?

874
00:42:37,032 --> 00:42:38,556
[loud rattling]

875
00:42:38,686 --> 00:42:40,253
I got one question, though.

876
00:42:40,732 --> 00:42:41,733
What's with the broad?

877
00:42:41,863 --> 00:42:42,734
[loud buzzing]

878
00:42:42,864 --> 00:42:43,778
She's gonna be the director.

879
00:42:43,909 --> 00:42:45,432
Oh, an attachment.

880
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,825
No, I hate attachments. Just--

881
00:42:46,955 --> 00:42:48,740
how many people
are on this project?

882
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,742
-Just her.
-Yeah, her, you, and Max.

883
00:42:50,872 --> 00:42:52,657
And you, and that can change
very quickly--

884
00:42:52,787 --> 00:42:54,572
Hey, maxi pad,
who's the killer now, huh?

885
00:42:54,702 --> 00:42:55,877
Wait, wait, wait,
don't call me that.

886
00:42:56,008 --> 00:42:57,400
Then be my bitch,
that's prison talk.

887
00:42:57,531 --> 00:42:58,663
-You--
-[loud rattling]

888
00:42:58,793 --> 00:42:59,925
[shouting]
Hey! Hey, hey, take it easy,

889
00:43:00,055 --> 00:43:01,796
take it easy!

890
00:43:01,927 --> 00:43:04,146
-Both of you.
-You kn-- you know what?
He doesn't do anything.

891
00:43:04,277 --> 00:43:05,670
We take all the risk
and he is bitching

892
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,106
-about the cast list?
-Excuse me, hey, see this,

893
00:43:07,236 --> 00:43:08,716
the way we're fighting?
That's a good sign.

894
00:43:08,847 --> 00:43:10,370
Oh, you know what?
I don't think it's a good sign,

895
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,850
-okay?
-That's because
you never made a movie.

896
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,025
I'm telling you, when people

897
00:43:13,155 --> 00:43:14,287
go for the throat this early,

898
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:15,636
that means
there's money to be made.

899
00:43:15,767 --> 00:43:16,985
Now get me out of here.

900
00:43:17,116 --> 00:43:18,900
[loud rattling]

901
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,425
Look, about this girl.
Just let me meet with her.

902
00:43:22,904 --> 00:43:25,341
Maybe-- maybe see some
of her film footage
of something.

903
00:43:25,472 --> 00:43:26,995
I'm not gonna fight you
on this, I just--

904
00:43:27,126 --> 00:43:29,128
I wanna hear her take,
her vision.

905
00:43:29,258 --> 00:43:30,520
Well, that sounds fair.

906
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:32,479
But we have to talk
to Nikki first.

907
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,046
But in the meantime,
do we have a deal on that?

908
00:43:34,176 --> 00:43:35,525
No, not yet.

909
00:43:36,004 --> 00:43:37,571
Let us talk it over and, uh,

910
00:43:37,702 --> 00:43:39,442
then we'll come back in
and we'll make a deal.

911
00:43:39,573 --> 00:43:40,922
Until then, don't do a thing.

912
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:42,532
All right, I won't.

913
00:43:43,969 --> 00:43:45,144
But the money guy is having
a New Year's Eve party,

914
00:43:45,274 --> 00:43:46,972
and that's when
I wanna pitch this to him.

915
00:43:48,495 --> 00:43:50,323
I hope we're right
about this Nikki chick.

916
00:43:50,453 --> 00:43:51,629
[Nikki moans]

917
00:43:52,238 --> 00:43:54,153
You are so good as a killer.

918
00:43:56,242 --> 00:43:57,896
I had the best teacher.

919
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:00,376
She's perfect.

920
00:44:00,507 --> 00:44:01,943
She's gonna keep the integrity.

921
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,208
-[Nikki grunts]
-[thuds]

922
00:44:06,774 --> 00:44:07,645
Strip.

923
00:44:08,733 --> 00:44:09,647
Now.

924
00:44:10,822 --> 00:44:12,519
Take off your pants.

925
00:44:13,259 --> 00:44:14,782
I wanna have it right now.

926
00:44:15,435 --> 00:44:16,262
Here?

927
00:44:18,351 --> 00:44:19,178
Right here.

928
00:44:20,266 --> 00:44:22,311
[Nikki grunts and pants]

929
00:44:22,442 --> 00:44:24,139
Right on the king's bed.

930
00:44:25,227 --> 00:44:26,707
-Like a princess.
-[deeply exhales]

931
00:44:29,492 --> 00:44:31,190
[moans] I'm so turned on.

932
00:44:33,627 --> 00:44:35,629
[whispering] It's like
you're really this killer,

933
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,111
and if I don't do
exactly what you say,

934
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:41,374
you'll rip me to pieces. [gasps]

935
00:44:41,983 --> 00:44:43,942
[both moans]

936
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:47,902
[Nikki moans]

937
00:44:49,774 --> 00:44:52,690
[deeply inhales and exhales]

938
00:44:53,299 --> 00:44:55,867
-[door rattling]
-Shit.

939
00:44:57,825 --> 00:44:59,740
-Shit.
-[groans]

940
00:45:01,524 --> 00:45:04,832
-[indistinct chatter]
-[deeply sighs]

941
00:45:04,963 --> 00:45:06,138
[Max]
...just the other two.

942
00:45:06,268 --> 00:45:07,966
Hey, where's the team?

943
00:45:08,923 --> 00:45:11,709
-Nikki, we need to talk.
-Huh?

944
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:12,710
What is it?

945
00:45:13,798 --> 00:45:16,496
How do you feel
meeting with Arnie?

946
00:45:16,626 --> 00:45:19,325
-You know, maybe show him
some footage.
-Fine.

947
00:45:19,455 --> 00:45:21,196
Good, that's--
that's what we told him.

948
00:45:21,327 --> 00:45:24,722
In fact, I'll put
something special together.

949
00:45:27,028 --> 00:45:29,727
I'll start tonight,
I think all of us
should be involved.

950
00:45:29,857 --> 00:45:33,078
I little cinema verité.

951
00:45:34,557 --> 00:45:37,169
Get them in the mood
for the tone of this piece.

952
00:45:37,996 --> 00:45:40,085
Yeah. Yeah, I do write poetry.

953
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:43,741
[chuckles]
E. E. Cummings, Robert Frost.

954
00:45:45,525 --> 00:45:47,614
-I would love to see
your dorm room.
-[gasps]

955
00:45:48,571 --> 00:45:49,572
Are you rich?

956
00:45:50,008 --> 00:45:53,141
-I-- is this goose acrylic?
-Mm-hmm.

957
00:45:55,491 --> 00:45:56,536
Are you laughing?

958
00:46:01,323 --> 00:46:02,150
All right.

959
00:46:04,457 --> 00:46:05,675
How was I supposed to know?

960
00:46:06,981 --> 00:46:08,156
Locked in the attic,

961
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,159
tied to my grandmother,

962
00:46:12,552 --> 00:46:15,250
beaten-- beaten--

963
00:46:15,381 --> 00:46:17,600
[shouts]
beaten by my drunken father!

964
00:46:21,256 --> 00:46:22,562
Of course I'm kidding, kiddo.

965
00:46:24,564 --> 00:46:25,783
Can't you take a joke?

966
00:46:28,089 --> 00:46:29,787
Don't you know
when a guy's kidding?

967
00:46:31,876 --> 00:46:33,834
I'm playing with you,
Bright Teeth.

968
00:46:33,965 --> 00:46:36,750
[shouting]
Hey, hey, where you going?
Get away from that door!

969
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:40,798
Hey, Bright Teeth,
do me a favor.

970
00:46:41,668 --> 00:46:42,538
[sharp thud]

971
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,367
-Put this on your head.
-[moans]

972
00:46:46,281 --> 00:46:48,893
Oh, come on.

973
00:46:49,894 --> 00:46:52,766
Humor me, you stupid--
I didn't mean that.

974
00:46:52,897 --> 00:46:55,595
[whispers] Just relax.

975
00:46:59,555 --> 00:47:00,469
Oh...

976
00:47:02,123 --> 00:47:05,344
-...oh God, you look good
in that thing.
-[sharply exhales]

977
00:47:06,911 --> 00:47:08,695
How you doing in there,
Bright Teeth?

978
00:47:09,565 --> 00:47:10,523
Maxine?

979
00:47:12,003 --> 00:47:14,527
-[sharp buzz]
-I'm gonna call you
Ginger now.

980
00:47:16,268 --> 00:47:18,923
-You don't mind
I call you Ginger, do you, Max?
-[soft rattling]

981
00:47:23,753 --> 00:47:25,407
God, you look good in that.

982
00:47:26,234 --> 00:47:28,410
Oh, I wanna bite you so hard.

983
00:47:28,541 --> 00:47:31,544
-I wanna pop your plastic--
-[Max] Okay, okay!

984
00:47:31,674 --> 00:47:33,894
-Okay, we got enough.
-Hey, hey, hey,
don't breathe so hard,

985
00:47:34,025 --> 00:47:36,897
-you'll use up all your oxygen,
it's just a small bag.
-Okay! Hey, hey!

986
00:47:37,028 --> 00:47:39,900
-I said we got enough, Cliff.
Didn't you hear me? I said stop!
-A girl like you,

987
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:42,250
-so perfect, Ginger.
A girl like you!
-[grunting]

988
00:47:42,381 --> 00:47:44,383
Nikki, I wanna cut away now,
because I-- I just don't want

989
00:47:44,513 --> 00:47:46,646
-to do this anymore. Hey, freak!
-"Hello, little lady."

990
00:47:46,776 --> 00:47:48,256
Why don't you give it
a rest, all right?

991
00:47:48,387 --> 00:47:49,910
"...about the lambs, Clarice?"

992
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:51,129
I'm not feeling very well.

993
00:47:51,259 --> 00:47:52,043
Uncle!

994
00:47:53,479 --> 00:47:55,133
"What have I ever done
to deserve such disrespect?

995
00:47:55,263 --> 00:47:57,265
-Tell me. Huh? Huh?
-[panting]

996
00:47:57,396 --> 00:47:59,137
-Huh?"
-Uncle! Uncle!

997
00:47:59,267 --> 00:48:02,749
-"Ladies! Yuh-huh!"
-Please, I can't! God!

998
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,360
-"Hey, Jean!"
-[shouting] Cut!
[gasping] This is not--

999
00:48:05,491 --> 00:48:08,973
-"Oh, lady... [indistinct]"
-Cut! Cut!

1000
00:48:09,103 --> 00:48:11,018
[Max gasping]
Fuck!

1001
00:48:11,149 --> 00:48:12,280
Fuck, yeah!

1002
00:48:12,411 --> 00:48:13,934
[Tiger]
That was fantastic.

1003
00:48:14,065 --> 00:48:16,067
Arnie's gonna love this,
it's brilliant!

1004
00:48:17,155 --> 00:48:18,765
What's up
with the impersonations?

1005
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,549
Come on, Max, Cliff was great!

1006
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,943
[panting]

1007
00:48:27,252 --> 00:48:28,514
Gonna get some air.

1008
00:48:31,691 --> 00:48:32,692
[soft thud]

1009
00:48:35,434 --> 00:48:37,436
[ominous music]

1010
00:48:38,393 --> 00:48:40,395
[heavy breathing]

1011
00:48:52,016 --> 00:48:53,756
[heavy breathing continues]

1012
00:48:54,322 --> 00:48:55,628
[clattering]

1013
00:48:56,194 --> 00:48:57,499
[loud thud]

1014
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:00,850
[grunting]

1015
00:49:00,981 --> 00:49:03,549
-[Tiger] Hmm. You know,
you two gotta admit...
-[laughs]

1016
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:05,943
...this whole thing is starting
to get a little weird.

1017
00:49:06,073 --> 00:49:08,597
It's going perfectly,
I think Cliff is doing
a terrific job.

1018
00:49:08,728 --> 00:49:09,772
-[scoffs]
-I wake up in the morning,

1019
00:49:09,903 --> 00:49:11,731
I think that he's
really the killer!

1020
00:49:11,861 --> 00:49:13,820
Creatively, I'm on fire. I mean,

1021
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,387
isn't that what you wanted
out of this, Max?

1022
00:49:15,517 --> 00:49:16,562
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

1023
00:49:17,345 --> 00:49:18,694
but this whole acting thing,

1024
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:21,045
watching Cliff
doing these stupid voices,

1025
00:49:21,175 --> 00:49:23,134
it's not my cup of Joe.

1026
00:49:23,264 --> 00:49:24,918
-Can't stand the heat.
-[Max] Oh, listen to you.

00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:50,668
As a matter of fact, I was.
I think it's a good idea.

1190
00:56:50,798 --> 00:56:52,278
I don't know who you think
this money guy is,

1191
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,019
but don't you think
that's kind of risky?

1192
00:56:54,149 --> 00:56:56,282
No, the guy's an animal fucker,

1193
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,415
a sick, sexual pervert.

1194
00:56:58,545 --> 00:57:00,591
This guy loves snuff movies,
he thinks our movie

1195
00:57:00,721 --> 00:57:02,288
is the closest thing
to get his rocks off.

1196
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,333
In fact,
if this guy was still married,

1197
00:57:04,464 --> 00:57:06,161
he'd want Cliff
to swing with his wife.

1198
00:57:07,249 --> 00:57:09,513
Terrific. That's
who we're in business with.

1199
00:57:09,643 --> 00:57:10,862
An animal fornicator.

1200
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:12,864
You know, it takes
all kinds of patrons

1201
00:57:12,994 --> 00:57:15,083
to fund the arts, Tiger.
It's just a fact of life.

1202
00:57:15,214 --> 00:57:16,781
[stutters] Wa-- wait a minute.

1203
00:57:16,911 --> 00:57:19,218
Snuff films
and the animal thing--

1204
00:57:19,348 --> 00:57:21,525
th-- the important thing is
the script stays

1205
00:57:21,655 --> 00:57:23,309
exactly the way
that Tiger wrote it.

1206
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,398
That's right, Nikki.
That's what you need to be

1207
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:26,878
most concerned with.

1208
00:57:27,008 --> 00:57:28,619
I am concerned with that.

1209
00:57:28,749 --> 00:57:31,143
If this guy's into necrophilia,
that's his business.

1210
00:57:31,273 --> 00:57:34,102
Our business is getting
this fucking movie made. Period.

1211
00:57:34,668 --> 00:57:37,279
I'll fight him
just like I'll fight
any other executive.

1212
00:57:37,758 --> 00:57:40,326
-After I have his money.
-[Arnie] Listen to this girl.

1213
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,023
She's old beyond her years.

1214
00:57:43,547 --> 00:57:45,157
That chick is made of ice.

1215
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:47,986
I think that's what it takes
to be great director.

1216
00:57:48,116 --> 00:57:50,031
Yeah, I think that's what
it takes to chill a martini.

1217
00:57:50,162 --> 00:57:52,469
I'm not sure I like it
in human qualities.

1218
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:54,732
-She's got a lot of ambition.
-She's a chainsaw,

1219
00:57:54,862 --> 00:57:56,298
and I'm scared
we're gonna get sawed off

1220
00:57:56,429 --> 00:57:58,344
the same way
she just did to poor Cliff.

1221
00:57:59,127 --> 00:58:00,346
We won't let that happen.

1222
00:58:04,219 --> 00:58:05,394
I know you've been there.

1223
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:08,963
-What?
-Don't give me that "what" shit.

1224
00:58:09,834 --> 00:58:11,444
She gave it up and you took it.

1225
00:58:12,967 --> 00:58:15,492
Let me give you a little advice
about women like her.

1226
00:58:16,014 --> 00:58:19,365
The fucking you get ain't worth
the fucking you get, okay?

1227
00:58:20,148 --> 00:58:21,672
-What does that mean?
-B--

1228
00:58:22,673 --> 00:58:25,066
Why don't you ask
your buddy Cliff
what that means?

1229
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,602
[jazz music]

1230
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,824
I think we better
have a word with Cliff.

1231
00:58:46,131 --> 00:58:48,133
[loud squeaking]

1232
00:58:48,873 --> 00:58:51,658
He's gone. He's completely gone.

1233
00:58:51,789 --> 00:58:53,312
Well, of course he's gone.

1234
00:58:53,442 --> 00:58:57,011
He took what was left
of his pride and split.

1235
00:58:57,142 --> 00:59:00,406
What was he gonna do,
wait around for her to rip
his other testicle off?

1236
00:59:01,973 --> 00:59:04,584
-We've gotta find him.
-[scoffs] Why?

1237
00:59:04,715 --> 00:59:07,282
Because he might blow the deal.

1238
00:59:07,848 --> 00:59:09,720
You know,
you're as bad as the ice queen.

1239
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:13,375
Do you or do you not
want this deal to work out?

1240
00:59:13,506 --> 00:59:14,420
What do you think?

1241
00:59:18,293 --> 00:59:20,948
Okay then, let's find him.

1242
00:59:25,474 --> 00:59:27,476
[engines rumbling]

1243
00:59:31,437 --> 00:59:33,831
[alarm wailing]

1244
00:59:33,961 --> 00:59:35,920
[music continues]

1245
00:59:45,407 --> 00:59:46,234
[thuds]

1246
00:59:51,326 --> 00:59:52,719
Mm...

1247
00:59:58,507 --> 00:59:59,465
Oh...

1248
01:00:00,814 --> 01:00:02,599
...I was hoping you would come.

1249
01:00:07,429 --> 01:00:08,474
[softly moans]

1250
01:00:10,432 --> 01:00:12,609
Oh, don't be mad at me, baby.

1251
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:15,699
There was nothing I could do.

1252
01:00:15,829 --> 01:00:17,614
[whispers] Just wait
till they get me the money.

1253
01:00:19,224 --> 01:00:21,618
I wanna be the one
that discovers you, baby.

1254
01:00:23,184 --> 01:00:25,491
I wanna make you a big star.

1255
01:00:29,713 --> 01:00:32,585
Starring
in the Nikki Randall picture.

1256
01:00:33,673 --> 01:00:35,980
[music continues]

1257
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:42,595
I'll fire them...

1258
01:00:44,336 --> 01:00:46,077
[whispers] ...and I'll hire you.

1259
01:00:50,081 --> 01:00:52,170
God, this is turning me on.

1260
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:57,697
Is that
why you're shooting me, baby?

1261
01:01:02,006 --> 01:01:04,617
You wanna see what I look like
in front of the lens?

1262
01:01:09,927 --> 01:01:10,928
Mm?

1263
01:01:19,545 --> 01:01:21,199
[softly]
I wanna be your director.

1264
01:01:22,591 --> 01:01:24,115
I wanna fill the screen...

1265
01:01:25,159 --> 01:01:27,205
...with lots and lots...

1266
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:31,600
...of big, beautiful close ups.

1267
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:34,342
How's that sound?

1268
01:01:37,389 --> 01:01:38,912
[ominous music]

1269
01:01:39,783 --> 01:01:41,523
That's not funny, baby.

1270
01:01:46,572 --> 01:01:48,574
[suspenseful music]

1271
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:55,886
Oh God!

1272
01:01:56,669 --> 01:01:58,366
[Nikki whimpers]

1273
01:01:58,497 --> 01:01:59,977
-[sharp thuds]
-[rattling]

1274
01:02:00,107 --> 01:02:01,979
[indistinct chatter and laughs]

1275
01:02:02,109 --> 01:02:03,937
[glass tinkling]

1276
01:02:04,068 --> 01:02:06,026
[inspirational piano music]

1277
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:18,822
-Excuse me, would you care for--
-[man] Yeah.

1278
01:02:18,952 --> 01:02:21,172
[women laugh]

1279
01:02:25,219 --> 01:02:26,481
So, where is your girlfriend?

1280
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,528
Shut up with that.
Nikki is not my girlfriend.

1281
01:02:29,658 --> 01:02:31,617
No director, no killer.

1282
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,924
-[Arnie indistinct chatter]
-I don't wanna blow this.

1283
01:02:34,054 --> 01:02:35,969
Don't worry,
we're not gonna blow it.

1284
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:38,102
I think there's
a role in this for you.

1285
01:02:38,232 --> 01:02:40,757
-You know,
Keanu was at this party...
-Arnie. Arnie.

1286
01:02:40,887 --> 01:02:42,062
-...he gave me this--
-What's up with this guy?

1287
01:02:42,193 --> 01:02:44,064
-[both] Arnie!
-Excuse me, Mary Ann.

1288
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:46,893
Guys, guys, I'm trying
to fuck this mud wrestler,

1289
01:02:47,024 --> 01:02:48,503
all right? Give me a minute.

1290
01:02:48,634 --> 01:02:50,157
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1291
01:02:50,288 --> 01:02:52,377
Cliff split. He's gone.

1292
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:55,554
-What do you mean, he's gone?
-Disappeared without a trace.

1293
01:02:55,684 --> 01:02:57,556
I need him here. I need
him here to make this deal.

1294
01:02:57,686 --> 01:02:58,775
-Where's Nikki?
-Not here yet.

1295
01:02:58,905 --> 01:03:00,777
Je-- All right, look.

1296
01:03:00,907 --> 01:03:03,388
I gotta tell Wolfie, I gotta
tell him right now. Let's go.

1297
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:12,832
Are you an actress? Mm,

1298
01:03:12,963 --> 01:03:15,008
it's been a while
since I've been here.

1299
01:03:15,139 --> 01:03:16,880
Boy, this place goes on forever.

1300
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:18,838
[indistinct muttering]

1301
01:03:21,145 --> 01:03:22,146
Try this door.

1302
01:03:24,235 --> 01:03:25,453
Whoa, Wolf!

1303
01:03:26,672 --> 01:03:28,587
-Hey!
-Whoa, Arnie!

1304
01:03:30,894 --> 01:03:33,461
-Come in, come in,
come in, come in.
-Hey.

1305
01:03:33,592 --> 01:03:34,941
Say hello to, uh, Eugenia.

1306
01:03:35,072 --> 01:03:36,160
-Hi.
-Hello, hello.

1307
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:38,162
These men make movies.

1308
01:03:38,292 --> 01:03:41,426
-Eugenia's an actress.
-No kidding? That's--
that's terrific.

1309
01:03:41,556 --> 01:03:44,081
Thanks. Well, I'll let you
get back to work, sweetie.

1310
01:03:44,211 --> 01:03:45,778
Okay, honey. Mm.

1311
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:47,345
-Happy new year.
-Happy new year.

1312
01:03:47,475 --> 01:03:48,433
You too.

1313
01:03:51,784 --> 01:03:53,177
Are these Dorothy's slippers?

1314
01:03:53,873 --> 01:03:55,092
[Wolfie]
You bet they are.

1315
01:03:55,222 --> 01:03:56,876
[Tiger]
And Glinda's magic wand!

1316
01:03:57,007 --> 01:03:58,835
But, man, you have everything!

1317
01:03:58,965 --> 01:04:01,011
Everything
but the Tin Man's hat.

1318
01:04:01,968 --> 01:04:04,449
This stuff is, uh,
is very expensive, right?

1319
01:04:04,579 --> 01:04:06,277
Uh, money is the easy part,

1320
01:04:06,407 --> 01:04:07,844
it's not having the hat
that gets me.

1321
01:04:07,974 --> 01:04:09,976
-Mm.
-You know, I need it.

1322
01:04:10,107 --> 01:04:12,370
Just like I need
to make a great film.

1323
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,762
Uh, and let me
tell you something.

1324
01:04:13,893 --> 01:04:16,374
Your project
has a chance to be great.

1325
01:04:16,504 --> 01:04:17,723
-Thanks.
-Yeah, oh,

1326
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,507
-uh, Max Brodsky--
-Brodsky.

1327
01:04:19,638 --> 01:04:21,205
-Nice to meet you.
-And Tiger Macquarie,
screenplay.

1328
01:04:21,335 --> 01:04:23,207
To make a movie
about a real killer

1329
01:04:23,337 --> 01:04:24,382
that's still killing.

1330
01:04:25,296 --> 01:04:27,472
That's an event,
it's showmanship.

1331
01:04:28,168 --> 01:04:29,866
And that's
what movies are all about.

1332
01:04:30,649 --> 01:04:34,435
It has been the thrill
of my life to write so dark.

1333
01:04:34,566 --> 01:04:36,089
So, where is
the man of the hour?

1334
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:40,311
Well, um... [stutters] Wolf,
the guy is not what, um,

1335
01:04:40,964 --> 01:04:43,401
what you would call,
uh, collaborative.

1336
01:04:44,271 --> 01:04:46,752
Of course not,
he's a serial killer, Arn.

1337
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,493
[chuckles]

1338
01:04:48,623 --> 01:04:49,973
Now, where is he?

1339
01:04:50,712 --> 01:04:52,932
Yeah, well, you know,
i-- it's a party,

1340
01:04:53,063 --> 01:04:54,847
-he doesn't wanna hurt anyone.
-Right. No.

1341
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,719
Half the people here
I want dead anyway.

1342
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:00,809
It's about his identity.
He doesn't want to get caught.

1343
01:05:02,376 --> 01:05:04,291
Then why did you bother coming?

1344
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:08,165
To talk deal.

1345
01:05:09,557 --> 01:05:12,996
Deal? The pâté is by the pool.

1346
01:05:13,866 --> 01:05:15,041
Go on, beat it.

1347
01:05:16,434 --> 01:05:18,523
Look, Wolf. I came up here
to tell you the guy--

1348
01:05:18,653 --> 01:05:20,351
You expect me to give you
something for nothing?

1349
01:05:20,481 --> 01:05:22,614
No, of course not, but--
but listen, I would at least--

1350
01:05:22,744 --> 01:05:26,226
"But, but--" nothing.
Stop wasting my time.

1351
01:05:26,357 --> 01:05:28,750
Look, I can deliver this guy.

1352
01:05:28,881 --> 01:05:30,578
My partners,
they can deliver this guy.

1353
01:05:31,144 --> 01:05:33,451
-He's ours.
-We work very well with him.

1354
01:05:34,147 --> 01:05:34,974
Then where is he?

1355
01:05:36,149 --> 01:05:37,672
You know, frankly,
I'm a little--

1356
01:05:37,803 --> 01:05:39,196
I'm a little insulted by you.

1357
01:05:39,326 --> 01:05:41,546
You can't trust me
and talk deal?

1358
01:05:41,676 --> 01:05:43,243
I need to meet the guy!

1359
01:05:43,374 --> 01:05:45,942
-I have the guy!
-Then where is he?

1360
01:05:46,072 --> 01:05:47,639
"Sin, sin, sin.

1361
01:05:48,335 --> 01:05:51,077
You're all sinners.
Every last one of you."

1362
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:54,124
[chuckling] Oh! Arn,

1363
01:05:54,254 --> 01:05:56,517
you had me going,
you son of a bitch.

1364
01:05:56,648 --> 01:06:00,043
The team.
First meeting with the money.

1365
01:06:01,174 --> 01:06:04,351
These guys
happen to mention they live
in a self-storage container?

1366
01:06:04,482 --> 01:06:06,353
-What?
-[chuckles] He's-- he's kidding,

1367
01:06:06,484 --> 01:06:08,703
-He's a kidder.
-[Cliff laughs]

1368
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:12,055
Making a movie with a killer,
living in a bin.

1369
01:06:12,185 --> 01:06:14,883
It's-- it's high risk,

1370
01:06:15,014 --> 01:06:17,364
high art, low rent.

1371
01:06:17,495 --> 01:06:18,844
See?

1372
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,977
This is showmanship.

1373
01:06:21,107 --> 01:06:25,329
I came to tell you
that I want my role.

1374
01:06:25,459 --> 01:06:27,331
This might not be
the perfect time.

1375
01:06:27,461 --> 01:06:29,159
No, wait, wait, wait,
let him talk.

1376
01:06:29,289 --> 01:06:30,160
Go ahead.

1377
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:31,074
And...

1378
01:06:32,336 --> 01:06:33,990
...I would like
to audition for you.

1379
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,992
Well, Wolf, listen. We were...

1380
01:06:36,775 --> 01:06:38,516
...we were talking
name actors for the role,

1381
01:06:38,646 --> 01:06:40,953
and Cliff's a little upset.

1382
01:06:41,693 --> 01:06:43,521
I'm a good actor,
you little has-been.

1383
01:06:43,651 --> 01:06:45,653
-Yeah, but you're also
a very good killer.
-I'm a good actor.

1384
01:06:45,784 --> 01:06:47,307
-You're also a very good killer.
-I'm a good actor.

1385
01:06:47,438 --> 01:06:48,787
-I'm a good actor!
-You can't--

1386
01:06:48,917 --> 01:06:50,180
can't do both,
you can't do both!

1387
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:51,398
-Well, I have done both.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1388
01:06:51,529 --> 01:06:53,009
I have done both!
A killer and actor,

1389
01:06:53,139 --> 01:06:54,358
I have done both!

1390
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,274
"You expect me to talk?"

1391
01:06:57,404 --> 01:06:59,363
"No, Mr. Bond,
I expect you to die."

1392
01:06:59,493 --> 01:07:00,668
He's very good.

1393
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:02,757
"Mister, mister,
I'm talking to you, Mister.

1394
01:07:02,888 --> 01:07:03,758
Mister, mister."

1395
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,152
"Definitely--
definitely not my underwear.

1396
01:07:06,283 --> 01:07:08,328
-Definitely not my underwear."
-Ugh, come on!

1397
01:07:08,459 --> 01:07:10,287
"Frankly, my dear,
I don't give a damn."

1398
01:07:10,417 --> 01:07:12,376
"With the hey, and the lady,
and the flaigen,

1399
01:07:12,506 --> 01:07:14,552
and the ho, and the hi.

1400
01:07:14,682 --> 01:07:17,163
Humding with the flaigen,
and the ho, and the lady--"

1401
01:07:17,294 --> 01:07:19,339
-[Arnie] Hey! Hey!
-"And the High Dean,
with the-- I'll get you,

1403
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:24,301
-Hey, hey, will yo--
will you stop already?
-What?

1404
01:07:24,431 --> 01:07:26,520
Let's try to make a movie, okay?

1405
01:07:26,651 --> 01:07:28,479
Stop your killing, and then,

1406
01:07:28,609 --> 01:07:30,350
maybe we'll talk
about an acting career.

1407
01:07:31,917 --> 01:07:34,311
I already had an acting career
till you destroyed it.

1408
01:07:34,441 --> 01:07:37,836
Wh-- [stutters]
what? I destroyed what?

1409
01:07:37,966 --> 01:07:39,490
I'm the guy.

1410
01:07:40,926 --> 01:07:42,145
[shouts] What guy?

1411
01:07:43,581 --> 01:07:47,672
I'm the impersonator
that had the role of Gilligan.

1412
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:54,070
-[Max] What?
-And now I'm gonna kill you.

1413
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,159
-No. No.
-Yeah, I'm gonna kill you.

1414
01:07:56,289 --> 01:07:57,682
-Hey, hey, hey...
-I'm gonna kill you!

1415

-I'm gonna fucking kill you!
-[all shouting]

1416
01:07:59,162 --> 01:08:00,554
-Fucking kill you!
-[Wolfie] Hey! Hey!

1417
01:08:00,685 --> 01:08:02,513
-Hey!
-I'm gonna kill.

1418
01:08:02,643 --> 01:08:03,818
-I'm gonna kill.
-Hey!

1419
01:08:08,301 --> 01:08:09,128
You see this?

1420
01:08:10,564 --> 01:08:13,741
Every day I get guys
trying to sell me one of these.

1421
01:08:17,049 --> 01:08:19,965
Bunch of garage mechanics
with oil cans.

1422
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,010
Every one of them worthless.

1423
01:08:26,537 --> 01:08:27,886
[Arnie]
So, what's your point?

1424
01:08:28,843 --> 01:08:30,889
I want the Tin Man's hat.

1425
01:08:31,455 --> 01:08:33,587
Hell, I need the Tin Man's hat.

1426
01:08:33,718 --> 01:08:38,418
But, if I don't buy it,
then I don't buy it.

1427
01:08:39,637 --> 01:08:40,507
Don't buy what?

1428
01:08:41,856 --> 01:08:44,685
No way is this guy a killer.

1429
01:08:46,861 --> 01:08:48,820
How can you say that,
you son of a bitch?

1430
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:50,038
-Hey, hey, hey, hey!
-[Wolfie] Hello?

1431
01:08:50,169 --> 01:08:51,344
He's not--
[stutters] He's kidding,

1432
01:08:51,475 --> 01:08:52,911
-he's only kidding.
-Fuck you,

1433
01:08:53,041 --> 01:08:54,608
-"I'm kidding." I'm serious!
-Hey! Whoa, whoa!

1434
01:08:54,739 --> 01:08:56,175
He's got a foul mouth.
Will you watch it?

1435
01:08:56,306 --> 01:08:57,698
What do you want to do?
I'm trying to make a deal--

1436
01:08:57,829 --> 01:08:59,178
...down stars,
Arn, before I stick

1437
01:08:59,309 --> 01:09:01,049
-my fist down your throat!
-Oh, yeah? Yeah? Well...

1438
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:03,051
-[unintelligible] ...make
a deal with a killer...
-Hey, hey!

1439
01:09:03,182 --> 01:09:05,402
-Calm down!
Will you talk to your partner?
-Max, Max!

1440
01:09:05,532 --> 01:09:06,838
Can I say something here?

1441
01:09:08,361 --> 01:09:10,058
...with the killer!
And you think

1442
01:09:10,189 --> 01:09:11,234
-you can threaten me?
-Watch out.

1443
01:09:11,364 --> 01:09:12,887
-Okay, wait-- [stutters]
-Watch out!

1444
01:09:13,018 --> 01:09:14,976
-Let's chat about it, okay?
-Hey, hey, guys, guys,

1445
01:09:15,107 --> 01:09:16,456
-guys, come on.
-I'd just like to say one thing.

1446
01:09:16,587 --> 01:09:18,763
You have the script.
That's his life.

1447
01:09:18,893 --> 01:09:21,026
-Isn't that proof enough?
-I didn't read the script,

1448
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,506
-I don't need to.
-Too bad!

1449
01:09:22,636 --> 01:09:24,334
You've got yourselves
a counterfeit,

1450
01:09:24,464 --> 01:09:27,163
-and I'm not buying.
-[Arnie] How can you
even say that?

1451
01:09:27,293 --> 01:09:28,990
-This is the real McCoy!
-"O, what a rogue

1452
01:09:29,121 --> 01:09:31,079
and peasant slave am I.

1453
01:09:31,776 --> 01:09:35,693
Is it not monstrous
that this player,

1454
01:09:36,346 --> 01:09:39,653
but in a fiction,
in a dream of passion,

1455
01:09:41,046 --> 01:09:44,092
could force his soul
so to his own conceit."

-Hamlet. It's appropriate.
-Oh, come on. I give up.

-What the hell is he doing?
-Showing you he's a killer.

1460
01:09:58,106 --> 01:09:58,890
"...conceit?

1461
01:09:59,369 --> 01:10:02,285
And all for nothing!

For...

1464
01:10:06,637 --> 01:10:09,161
Hey actor, enough.
It's not gonna work.

1465
01:10:11,903 --> 01:10:14,819
You know, I don't care
how much money you have.

1466
01:10:14,949 --> 01:10:15,776
That was rude.

1467

You see, I'm the one

you're looking
to do business with.

Look, fella, I don't know how
you heard about this project,

that might change your mind.

be able to say or do

I know she was your girlfriend.

Sorry, but she was using my life
to make herself famous.

1508
01:12:13,285 --> 01:12:14,460
And that is
a kind of selfishness

1509

01:12:45,839 --> 01:12:47,319
Now that I have your attention,

1522
01:12:48,276 --> 01:12:51,018
you understand now
the world is a scary place?

1523
01:12:51,758 --> 01:12:54,805
You talk of horror,
and morality,

1524
01:12:55,458 --> 01:12:58,939
and let genocide occur in Bosnia
as if Hitler never happened.

1525
01:12:59,549 --> 01:13:00,898
Is Wolfie gonna die?

1526
01:13:02,813 --> 01:13:04,554
Damaged, not dying.

1527
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:06,860
Help me, please!

1528
01:13:08,775 --> 01:13:09,776
-[Max moans]
-[scoffs]

1529
01:13:11,212 --> 01:13:13,301
-Move your hand.
-No, no, no!

1530
01:13:14,172 --> 01:13:15,086
Okay.

1531
01:13:17,828 --> 01:13:20,047
-[moans]
-I want you to bleed.

1532
01:13:20,178 --> 01:13:23,399
Wasn't this your idea,
to serve the American public

1533
01:13:23,529 --> 01:13:25,923
yet another crappy
serial killer movie?

1534
01:13:27,141 --> 01:13:28,578
[groaning continues]

1535
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:34,061
This makes me very angry.

1536
01:13:35,498 --> 01:13:37,630
S-- so, um,
so you're angry. Um...

1537
01:13:38,892 --> 01:13:40,067
Let's talk.

1538
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:42,635
[gasping]

1539
01:13:43,288 --> 01:13:44,681
[chokingly]
Maybe we can work something out.

1540
01:13:44,811 --> 01:13:49,120
DaVinci, Einstein,
Mozart, titans.

1541
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:52,166
Never afraid
to tell the truth, as am I.

1542
01:13:52,732 --> 01:13:55,039
In an abstract city
full of greedy poseurs,

1543
01:13:55,169 --> 01:13:56,257
I am an original.

1544
01:13:57,345 --> 01:13:59,783
A titan in a silly red wig,
an artist!

1545
01:14:01,219 --> 01:14:03,917
And in my art,
there is no copyright,
I am the copyright.

1546
01:14:04,701 --> 01:14:05,919
[chokingly] Mister, please.

1547
01:14:07,617 --> 01:14:10,141
-You're not wrong
to be fascinated with me.
-[sharp thud]

1548
01:14:10,271 --> 01:14:12,273
[gasps] God!

1549
01:14:13,666 --> 01:14:15,799
I've been doing this
for 27 years,

1550
01:14:16,756 --> 01:14:19,411
in various forms
and in various cities,

1551
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:22,414
and no one
has ever come close to me.

1552
01:14:23,981 --> 01:14:26,940
And then, watching you...

1553
01:14:30,553 --> 01:14:32,163
...I saw my own reflection.

1554
01:14:33,686 --> 01:14:34,774
I saw the ending.

1555
01:14:36,689 --> 01:14:38,430
I know how this is gonna end.

1556
01:14:39,649 --> 01:14:42,869
I am not gonna stand by
and let this group of misfits

1557
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,699
steal my life, something
that you know nothing about.

1558
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:49,223
I am the one
with a story to tell, not you.

Maybe we can help you.

1561
01:14:55,186 --> 01:14:56,448
What can you do for me?

1562
01:14:57,144 --> 01:14:59,364
Find me an empty
bathroom stall to sleep in?

1563
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:01,975
A producer who sleeps
in a lavatory?

1564
01:15:02,585 --> 01:15:05,413
Pathetic rodents without
an original thought
between them?

1565
01:15:05,544 --> 01:15:07,154
And your newest best friend...

1566
01:15:07,851 --> 01:15:10,854
-[forcibly breathing]
-...a true sicko
with deep pockets!

1567
01:15:13,596 --> 01:15:14,814
I am the real thing.

1568
01:15:15,423 --> 01:15:17,425
You can't do anything for me.

1569
01:15:17,556 --> 01:15:19,427
'Nuff said. [panting]

1570
01:15:20,864 --> 01:15:22,039

[light dramatic music]

1572
01:15:27,784 --> 01:15:30,569

how to wear this, do you...

1573
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:33,572
-[breathing shakily]
-...Costume Killer?

1574
01:15:34,878 --> 01:15:36,401
It's ironic.

1575
01:15:41,145 --> 01:15:42,755
You don't get that at all,
do you?

1576
01:15:44,104 --> 01:15:45,671
[deeply breathing]

1577
01:15:45,802 --> 01:15:46,585
No.

1578
01:15:47,978 --> 01:15:50,241
[panting]

1579
01:15:58,336 --> 01:15:59,946
You, I like.

1580
01:16:03,123 --> 01:16:04,385
You do your homework.

1581
01:16:08,738 --> 01:16:11,915
You, I could work with.

1582
01:16:15,527 --> 01:16:17,921

Cliff?

1595
01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:12,105
Yeah?

1596
01:17:12,236 --> 01:17:13,280
Was that a growl?

1597
01:17:14,978 --> 01:17:16,501
I-- it just sort of came out.

1598
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:20,200
I thought the growl was great.

1599
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:22,333
Jake?

1600
01:17:22,463 --> 01:17:23,377
Over here, Cliff.

1601
01:17:24,030 --> 01:17:25,553
-Over here.
-Oh.

1602
01:17:27,077 --> 01:17:28,382
Can I talk to you a minute?

1603
01:17:29,732 --> 01:17:30,776
Yeah, sure.

1604
01:17:32,038 --> 01:17:33,736
-He can't get it.
-[Cliff] Oh, man,

1605
01:17:33,866 --> 01:17:35,868
-that was so good. I loved it.
-Sure it was.

1606
01:17:35,999 --> 01:17:38,871
-[chuckling] Thank you. Oh!
-Oh, God. Fantastic.

1607
01:17:39,524 --> 01:17:41,308
Uh, reset to one, go right away.

1608
01:17:41,439 --> 01:17:43,223

right away, people.

Over here. Get over here.

-They don't listen.
-I-- I know.

1612
01:17:51,057 --> 01:17:53,843
-You're having fun?
-Absolutely.

1613
01:17:53,973 --> 01:17:55,627
I hear you're running
all over town taking meetings,

1614
01:17:55,758 --> 01:17:57,063
you-- you're the idea man.

1615

-[Wolfie mumbling] Right.
-[sharply exhales]

1620
01:18:11,077 --> 01:18:13,863
I, uh, I understand
why you didn't want
Cliff to growl.

1621
01:18:14,559 --> 01:18:17,475
It's amazing, you're
a first-time director.
[chuckles]

-Here, Jake.
-Oh, I'm sorry,

let's talk later, okay.

[soft clinking]

1626
01:18:32,490 --> 01:18:35,754
Just give me 20 feet, will you?
All right, just 20 feet, okay?

1627
01:18:35,885 --> 01:18:37,234
I'm not going anywhere.

1628
01:18:38,452 --> 01:18:40,977
-Uh, Cliff.
-[clinking continues]

1629
01:18:42,065 --> 01:18:45,372
If you let me,
I could take you there.

1630
01:18:46,765 --> 01:18:50,290
But yo-- you,
you have to let me, Cliff.

1631
01:18:52,162 --> 01:18:53,250
You have to trust me.

1633
01:18:55,426 --> 01:18:57,080
Oh, I trust you,
Jake, I really do.

1634
01:18:57,820 --> 01:18:59,822
But you're just a little
scared of me, aren't you?

1635
01:19:00,953 --> 01:19:02,738
-No.
-It's-- it's all right,
it's all right.

1636
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:05,566
-I'm scared of me sometimes.
-[sharply exhales]

1637
01:19:06,611 --> 01:19:09,483
It's not about rage,
Cliff, it's about purpose.

1638
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:12,617
So, no growl?

1639
01:19:14,010 --> 01:19:17,056
-Right, right. No...
[stutters] no growl.
-Right.

1640

Tell the truth,
and you will win.

1641
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:23,367
Not-- not just as an actor,
as a person.

1642
01:19:24,672 --> 01:19:26,674
It's why I cashed in my chips.

1643
01:19:26,805 --> 01:19:29,590
So that I could sit
at the table and tell the truth.
