1
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:10,544
(loud alarm)

2
00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:13,147
(dogs barking)

3
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:20,788
Help me over!

4
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:23,191
Give me the stuff first.

5
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:25,426
Help me.

6
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:28,762
They're close, just
 pull yourself over!

7
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:30,664
(screaming)

8
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:31,532
Come on!

9
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:42,276
Babe--

10
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,378
Come on, they're close.

11
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:45,779
Here, take this.

12
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:47,215
I don't want it.

13
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:49,817
You're under 18, you
won't even do the time.

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,086
No, no, no, don't leave me.

15
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,587
Don't leave me!

16
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:57,458
You'll be all right, just
 keep your mouth shut!

17
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:59,493
Drop the gun, drop it!

18
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:02,196
Wait for me!

19
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,200
Out of the car!

20
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:06,800
Put your hands
 where I can see you!

21
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:07,801
Okay, okay, okay man.

22
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:09,437
Hands behind your head.

23
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,704
Hey man, I don't know her.

24
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:13,141
I don't know her, man!

25
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:15,876
- [Police Officer]
 Give me your hand.

26
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,711
- [Boyfriend] I don't know
 her man, what's going on?

27
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,880
I don't know her.

28
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,416
- [Judge] I hereby sentence
 you, Caroline Magavo,

29
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,819
to three years at
 the Educational and
 Reformatory Services

30
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:28,289
of the State Youth Authority.

31
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,563
Fight this fire aggressively,

32
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,632
but always with safety first.

33
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:41,169
Be aware of your surroundings.

34
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:44,872
Work with a sense of
 urgency, focus, and control.

35
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:50,744
(dramatic instrumental music)

36
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,497
Relax ladies, we blew a tire.

37
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:12,500
Hey DJ.

38
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:13,634
- [DJ] Tommy.

39
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,436
Yeah, yeah we blew a tire
 what do you want us to do?

40
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,671
Well I have the crew
 doing a control burn

41
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:18,906
off the service road.

42
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,608
Meet me there.

43
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,311
I got you, I'll take care of it.

44
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,288
Captain Kelly, the
 bus is on the way.

45
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:35,323
Got it DJ.

46
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:42,530
Control, focus.

47
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:56,644
Spot fire, move it!

48
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:57,645
- [Woman] Hey Keisha, come now.

49
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:01,849
- [Captain Kelly] Come
 on now, tighten it up!

50
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:05,219
Move it!

51
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:07,255
Let's go now, keep it up.

52
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,477
- [Woman] Oketa, I
 know you got my back.

53
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,878
Hey DJ.

54
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,913
The county firemen are
impressed by your girls.

55
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:36,016
I never expected anything
 less, you know that.

56
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,918
Way to hold the line ladies.

57
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,621
And I tell you, if I had
your line in college,

58
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:41,589
I would've made the NFL.

59
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:42,990
Yeah DJ, we know, we know.

60
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,958
You were a legend
 in your own time.

61
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:46,960
He was a legend in his own mind.

62
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:47,861
(laughing)

63
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,297
Watch that.

64
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,831
- [Officer] All right,
single file to the van.

65
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:51,865
What are they doing here?

66
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,000
- [Officer] Let's go ladies.

67
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:53,834
They're switching vehicles.

68
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,269
They got a flat and
 I gotta get them

69
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:56,804
through processing by dinner.

70
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:57,938
So you girls can kick
 back while the tire

71
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:58,972
is being changed.

72
00:03:59,006 --> 00:03:59,840
Oh...

73
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,009
That works.

74
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,678
(laughing)

75
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:05,913
Yo, let me get this water.

76
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:06,947
You want a water?

77
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,015
Yeah.

78
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,551
Come on ladies.

79
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,360
(screaming)

80
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:21,362
No, no, no, no, no,
get it off, get it off.

81
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:22,530
Get it off me!

82
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:24,598
I got it, I got it.
 Get it off me!

83
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:25,633
It's gone.

84
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:31,972
Whoa, did you see the
 size of that thing?

85
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,073
You almost died.

86
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,543
(laughing)

87
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:40,080
I don't know why you
 laughing, Keisha.

88
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,515
First time you saw a ladybug

89
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:43,317
you thought it was
 a flying cockroach.

90
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:44,485
(laughing)

91
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,320
- [Officer] Let's go ladies.

92
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:46,954
Let's keep it moving ladies.

93
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,689
Hey Butterfly...

94
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:53,026
When it lands on
 you, it's good luck.

95
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:57,898
(dramatic piano music)

96
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:27,395
- [Officer] Okay ladies,
 single file, off the bus.

97
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:29,029
- [Female Officer] All
 right ladies, come on.

98
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:29,963
Move it.

99
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,500
(dog barking)

100
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:33,967
Come on.

101
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,002
Come on now.

102
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:41,909
All your clothes in the bin.

103
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:55,789
Everything.

104
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:15,609
(buzzing)

105
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:25,686
There are the phones,
 that's the rec room.

106
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,055
CO is on the block 24/7.

107
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,890
Back there's your shower...

108
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:34,094
Your unit houses all the older
 girls, 17 to 25 years old.

109
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:37,998
Here we are.

110
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:42,936
Ms. Magavo, your cell's
there, number seven.

111
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:48,041
Ms. Catares, you're over
there, number eight.

112
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,111
Ms. Adams, number nine.

113
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:56,016
(somber piano music)

114
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:13,066
All right, okay,
 whatever you need.

115
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,070
(buzzing)

116
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,200
Amy...

117
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,970
Check out Butterfly over
there eating by herself.

118
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,204
She hasn't been here 24 hours

119
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:53,006
and you're already
 trying to save her.

120
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,041
Don't hate.

121
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,676
Ain't that what I did for you?

122
00:07:55,709 --> 00:08:00,180
Yeah you ever need a kidney,
 you know who to call.

123
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,817
Hey um, sorry about yesterday.

124
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,118
Yo check out that new girl.

125
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:09,222
We weren't laughing at
 you or nothing like that.

126
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:10,090
I'm Terry.

127
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:14,294
And you are...

128
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,829
I'm none of your business.

129
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:19,933
(chuckling) Well she told you.

130
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:23,236
What?

131
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:39,853
Watch who you chill with.

132
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:45,559
- [CO] All right,
 take it easy ladies.

133
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:51,064
So what clique you roll
with on the outside?

134
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:52,299
I'm not with a gang.

135
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:55,335
That's too bad, a
gang's like family Nana.

136
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,805
We take care of each other.

137
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,141
I'm cool, I take care of myself.

138
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:05,813
Yeah, you got runaway
 written all over you.

139
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:08,982
Like I told that other girl...

140
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:10,651
I'm none of your business.

141
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:13,086
Oh now see, that's
 where you're wrong.

142
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,890
Everything up in
 here is my business.

143
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:20,093
Whatever you want I
 could get for you.

144
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,297
Whatever?

145
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,265
Whatever.

146
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,937
I want to get a letter
 to my boyfriend.

147
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,304
- [Inmate In Blue]
 Where's he at?

148
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:32,139
Locked up.

149
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:35,142
They won't let me
 send him a letter.

150
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,176
It's done.

151
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:41,048
And if he writes me back?

152
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,050
Hey, I got you babygirl.

153
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,619
Caroline Magavo.

154
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,891
I'm Dwayne Johnson, DJ.

155
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,160
I'm the Senior Youth
 Counselor here.

156
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,062
Why don't you follow
 me into my office.

157
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,730
Do I have to?

158
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:58,065
(chuckling)

159
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,800
Ms. Magavo...

160
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,969
If you pick up on
 Pedra's bad attitude,

161
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:03,403
you might get detention.

162
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,905
If you pick up on
 her other vices,

163
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,174
you may never get outta here.

164
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:09,142
Follow me.

165
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,250
No contraband, weapons,
tobacco or drugs allowed, ever.

166
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:21,955
No making contact
 with younger inmates

167
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:24,858
outside of your
 housing unit, ever.

168
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:26,393
You get in a fight,
 spit on a CO,

169
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,395
or try to escape you get TD.

170
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,197
That's temporary detention.

171
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,199
Now you're free to move
about your housing unit

172
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,967
when you're not
 in school or work.

173
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:36,970
School is mandatory
until you get your GED.

174
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:39,372
Once you complete your GED...

175
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,374
Then you have the option
 of taking college courses

176
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,677
or getting a job.

177
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:45,278
What kind of job?

178
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:50,050
You can learn animal
 grooming, or landscaping...

179
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,084
There's a...

180
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:56,089
Culinary program if you
wanna become a chef.

181
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,961
What about those girls?

182
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,030
They're firefighters.

183
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:05,032
Like real firefighters?

184
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,067
They can do that
 when they get out?

185
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,401
That is correct.

186
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:14,141
There's a special program
 for inmates who qualify

187
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,776
called "Crew Nine".

188
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,812
If you're interested--

189
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:21,448
I don't want to
 be no firefighter.

190
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:22,883
Am I done?

191
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,318
Why do you think you're here?

192
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,028
That kind of attitude
 isn't gonna get you

193
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:37,097
very far in here, Caroline.

194
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:39,299
Sit down.

195
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:51,211
Now why don't you tell me why
 you really think you're here?

196
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,113
Cause the robbery.

197
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,515
Did the robbery just happen?

198
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,918
Or did you cause it to happen?

199
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,152
I'm doing my punishment okay?

200
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,821
So back off.

201
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:02,923
Voltaire says the
 punishment of the criminal

202
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,992
should serve a purpose.

203
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:07,360
Once a man is hanged,
 he is useless.

204
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:11,765
What do you think the
 purpose is of you being here?

205
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:16,503
Do you know what the
 word "redeemed" means?

206
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,338
Yeah, like...

207
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,407
If you pawn something,
 if you got the money,

208
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,375
then you can buy back.

209
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,111
That is correct.

210
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:29,382
You became a criminal the moment
you broke into that store.

211
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,517
But...

212
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,920
You can buy yourself back.

213
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,158
And it starts with turning
 every "it just happened"

214
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,227
into "I made it happen".

215
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,094
Hear me?

216
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,132
Good.

217
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,842
We all create our own reality
 by the choices we make.

218
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,353
You're home early.

219
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,187
- [Son] Hey dad.

220
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,421
Hey son, looking good.

221
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,123
Hi.

222
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:14,127
I needed to be reminded how
 things are supposed to be.

223
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:17,430
(chuckling)

224
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:25,572
What's the matter?

225
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:27,975
Hey!

226
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:30,177
Oh, that's what
 I'm talking about.

227
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,379
You want some of the old man?

228
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:33,847
Huh?

229
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:35,949
Oh, don't do it to
 me, don't do that!

230
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:36,950
Watch out!

231
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,585
He got an A on his
 science test, by the way.

232
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:39,419
Did he really?

233
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:40,353
- [Wife] He did, he did.

234
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:42,189
Oh okay, we'll play to 10

235
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:44,057
and then we'll take the
pretty lady to dinner.

236
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:45,258
- [Son] All right.

237
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:46,493
Let's go, let's see what
you're working with.

238
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:47,961
- [Wife] Okay, show
 him how it's done.

239
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:48,561
Don't do it to me,
 don't do it to me,

240
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:50,030
don't do it to me.

241
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:52,099
Very nice, watch your
 mother pass the ball.

242
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:53,166
Got it.

243
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,334
See that?

244
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,103
You passed it to him?

245
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,171
Double teamed here.

246
00:13:58,205 --> 00:13:59,139
I thought he was an accident.

247
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,408
(laughing)

248
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:05,612
I lived in Master Hugh's family

249
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,182
about seven years.

250
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:12,920
During this time I succeeded...

251
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:15,889
In...

252
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,059
Learning to read and write.

253
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:22,963
All right.

254
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,065
Caroline, next.

255
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,037
Like basically
 Frederick Douglass,

256
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,139
one is willing to read.

257
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:35,943
Very good, but can you
continue reading the paragraph?

258
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,577
I don't like reading out loud.

259
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,412
It is required in this class.

260
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:41,514
I don't think she can read.

261
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,150
Hey!

262
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:44,184
Tammy, turn around.

263
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,185
(bell ringing)

264
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,588
All right ladies, line
 up at the door please.

265
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:59,066
- [Pedra] Aight, go.

266
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,580
- [Inmate] You know what?

267
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:14,948
I'll probably be fine.

268
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:17,150
- [CO] Where does it hurt?

269
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:20,087
- [Inmate] Nah, nah, it's okay.

270
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,154
Thank you.

271
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,391
- [Caroline] Hey, hey,
 what are you doing?

272
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,325
It's mine!

273
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,594
- [Tammy] I need a notebook.

274
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:30,430
Hey, give me back my notebook.

275
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,165
Or what?

276
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:33,033
Hey.

277
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:37,604
Why don't you give the
girl back her notebook?

278
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:40,107
I got mad respect
 for you, Pedra.

279
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,143
This broad ain't down
 with you, are you?

280
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:44,244
Tell me cause...

281
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,180
If you are, I'll give it back.

282
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:49,682
Don't fall for the
 setup, just walk away.

283
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:53,120
I'll give the girl
 back her notebook...

284
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:58,725
Not your fight.

285
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:08,735
Baby...

286
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,537
I miss you so much...

287
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,741
I'm not mad at you for saying...

288
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:18,178
I don't care that you
 said it was my idea.

289
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:19,246
(laughing)

290
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,080
Just back away.

291
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,781
I'm so scared.

292
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,016
So scared...

293
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:31,091
Call the fight!

294
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,292
- [CO] DJ, DJ!

295
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,729
(loud commotion)

296
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:38,065
Hey, move it!

297
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:39,332
Get out the way, move!

298
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:40,167
Move, now!

299
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,734
Hey, that's enough!

300
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:42,669
Let her go.

301
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:43,636
That's it, hey!

302
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,737
Stop it!

303
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,706
That's enough, stop it!

304
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,208
DJ, she stole her notebook.

305
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,442
I don't care!

306
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,244
That's 24 hours detention for...

307
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:52,179
Hey, stop it!

308
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:53,146
- [Caroline] She started it!

309
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,547
Hey, hey, stop it!

310
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:57,184
That's it, 24 just became 72.

311
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,219
- [Caroline] It wasn't my fault!

312
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,553
Stop!

313
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:02,155
It never is.

314
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:03,723
It wasn't my fault!

315
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,459
It wasn't my fault!

316
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,729
It wasn't my fault!

317
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,268
(sobbing)

318
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,384
Who's there?

319
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:33,786
Terry.

320
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,289
How are you doing, Butterfly?

321
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:38,325
Why do you call me Butterfly?

322
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:42,129
- [Terry] Cause I don't
know your name yet.

323
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,300
Caroline.

324
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:49,202
Caroline.

325
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:50,937
Why is Terry talking to her?

326
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,106
She knows better than to
 break the lockdown rules.

327
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,474
Hey, hey, hey.

328
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,177
Leave her be.

329
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:01,548
I brought you a magazine
to kill the time.

330
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,165
Wait...

331
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:19,766
What's that book about?

332
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,134
A philosopher.

333
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:23,536
A who?

334
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:28,708
He's a Greek dude who
 asked a lot of questions.

335
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:32,379
I could fill up a book
 with a bunch of questions.

336
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:34,614
All right, Caroline.

337
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:35,715
Wait, um...

338
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,620
Isn't that book
 boring and stuff?

339
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,589
It has no stories?

340
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,424
Nah, there's stories in here.

341
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,526
Yeah, about Greek dude.

342
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:49,196
About everybody.

343
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,399
You see that shadow of
the window on your wall?

344
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,167
- [Caroline] What about it?

345
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:56,603
Socrates tells this one story

346
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,640
about these inmates
 down in this cave.

347
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:04,711
Now they've been
 chained together their
 entire lives, right?

348
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,213
No sunlight, nothing.

349
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:09,716
Just this fire behind
 them making the light.

350
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,787
Tell me something,
 is there a shadow

351
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:18,157
of the razor wire on
 the wall right now?

352
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,694
Yeah.

353
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,563
Look out the window.

354
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:34,874
Can you see the razor wire?

355
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:43,316
- [Caroline] Yeah.

356
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,952
See?

357
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:49,256
You're already better off than
 the prisoners in the cave.

358
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,323
I mean they've got these chains

359
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:52,692
around their necks and
 around their feet, right?

360
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:55,262
They can't even turn
 their heads around

361
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:57,330
and see what's behind them.

362
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:02,902
Their entire world is
 just the wall of the cell.

363
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,438
Isn't that crazy?

364
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:07,607
It's a metaphor.

365
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:11,210
Socrates was saying that...

366
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:16,916
Everybody's a prisoner until
 they start asking questions

367
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:20,820
and finding out the answers.

368
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:25,292
The prisoners of the story,
 they never ask questions.

369
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:28,328
The cave wall is
 their entire world.

370
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,899
Do they ever escape?

371
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:33,566
Psh...

372
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,937
These zombies come down, right?

373
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,373
And then there's
this crazy scene

374
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,775
where all these vampires
 come out, and mermaids...

375
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,577
It's crazy, Caroline.

376
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:45,945
Are you serious?

377
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,881
(chuckling) No,
 I'm not for real.

378
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:52,285
You're going to have
 to read the book.

379
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,389
All right Caroline,
 I'll see you later.

380
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,030
DJ.

381
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:06,032
We gotta talk.

382
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:06,999
Hey.

383
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:09,902
I've been going over
 the files some more...

384
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,339
And we've got two
 Crew Nine girls

385
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:13,906
coming up for parole soon,

386
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,542
so keep your fingers crossed.

387
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:16,709
Nothing helps the program

388
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:18,478
more than a success
 story or two.

389
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:20,980
Great, for the girls...

390
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,415
Not sure about the program,

391
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:23,783
this is gonna make our
 numbers even smaller

392
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:25,385
and my commander is
 already concerned

393
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:26,686
that with not enough
 girls out there

394
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:27,920
we could have safety issues.

395
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:28,821
Well you tell him the
 program was designed

396
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:31,624
to teach the girls
 how to build things,

397
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:32,992
how to save people's lives,

398
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,061
girls that have been
 abused and objectified

399
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:35,962
their entire life.

400
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:37,029
But if you can't provide
me with the bodies

401
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:38,698
to do the job...

402
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,900
We gotta kill the program.

403
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:45,938
(somber acoustic guitar music)

404
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:57,684
* Hey now

405
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:01,954
* All you children

406
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:05,091
* Leave your lights on

407
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:07,894
* Better leave your lights on

408
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:10,930
* There's an angel

409
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:14,567
* With her hand on my head

410
00:22:16,102 --> 00:22:20,106
* She say I got
 nothing to fear *

411
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,110
* There's a darkness

412
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:27,780
* Living deep in my soul

413
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:34,020
* It's still got a
 purpose to serve *

414
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:38,090
* So let your light shine

415
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:41,127
* Deep into my home

416
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:47,600
* God don't let
 me lose my nerve *

417
00:22:47,634 --> 00:22:49,068
* She say

418
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,137
* La ilaha

419
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,876
* Illa Allah

420
00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:00,146
* You all shine like stars

421
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,915
* And we fade away

422
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:04,016
* I don't know what
 you've been told *

423
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,919
* I don't what
 you've been told *

424
00:23:06,953 --> 00:23:09,456
* Crew Nine girls
 too hot to hold *

425
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:11,691
* Crew Nine girls
 too hot to hold *

426
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,060
* We fight fires
 with all the men *

427
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:16,763
* We fight fires
 with all the men *

428
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:19,466
* And do it while looking
 much better than them *

429
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:22,168
* And do it while looking
 much better than them *

430
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:24,637
* I don't know what
 you've been told *

431
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:28,841
* I don't know what
 you've been told *

432
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,147
Well look at you.

433
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,184
Ready to get out of here?

434
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:44,123
Do you know who
 Nelson Mandela is?

435
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:48,661
Being in here doesn't
 mean you're stupid.

436
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:50,129
When they asked
 him how he made it

437
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:53,065
through 27 years of prison...

438
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,434
He said "By being measured".

439
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:58,104
Acting like a hothead
 isn't gonna make the time

440
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:00,740
go any faster, Ms. Magavo.

441
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:01,574
Let's go.

442
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:10,683
Are those cigarette burns?

443
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:19,659
I don't want to
 be late for class.

444
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,130
(somber piano music)

445
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,721
You can't sleep?

446
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:59,766
Remember that new
 girl I told you about?

447
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:00,667
Mhm.

448
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:05,204
She had cigarette burns
up and down her arms.

449
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:09,008
But it's nothing you
 haven't seen before.

450
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:13,045
Still, you never get used to it.

451
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:16,716
These girls come in so broken.

452
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:24,156
Kelly threatened to
pull his program today.

453
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,792
Not enough girls.

454
00:25:27,827 --> 00:25:30,597
You've got other programs, baby.

455
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,066
Why are you fighting an
 upward battle with this one?

456
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,001
What am I supposed to do,

457
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,136
have them in therapy all day?

458
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,171
You don't understand it.

459
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:44,076
Maybe I don't.

460
00:26:05,632 --> 00:26:08,167
When I first transferred
from the men's facility

461
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,270
I remember this
 17 year old girl.

462
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,139
She got her diploma...

463
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:20,747
I patted her on her shoulder,
 you know, to congratulate her.

464
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:23,816
Boy, was that a mistake.

465
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:32,024
Shoulda seen the
 look on her face.

466
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:36,195
One of absolute repulsion.

467
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:43,636
Ah, that poor child must've
 experienced inner life.

468
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:51,310
I built Crew Nine to change
 the way they saw themselves.

469
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:56,215
So that those girls
 could feel strong.

470
00:26:56,248 --> 00:27:00,352
And in turn, see how other
people respected that strength.

471
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:02,621
That's all I ever wanted.

472
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:08,094
You can't get that
feeling being in a cage.

473
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:29,882
So...

474
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:32,284
The Pythagorean theorem says...

475
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,388
That in a right triangle,

476
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:40,226
the sum of the square of
 the two right angle sides

477
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:41,994
will always be the same

478
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:44,931
as the square of the hypotenuse.

479
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:47,199
That's the longest side of...

480
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:57,209
Let's say that in this
 equation that side A

481
00:27:57,243 --> 00:27:59,211
is just as long as...

482
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:03,315
(bell ringing)

483
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:06,052
(piano music)

484
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,989
(knocking)

485
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:13,092
Move these women before
I let these kids out.

486
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,360
- [CO] Hold on.

487
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:25,772
- [Caroline] So, you can get
 this letter to my boyfriend?

488
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:27,406
You should spread the
 word up in that school

489
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,075
that I can get them
 what they need.

490
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:30,342
Hey, I sling for you.

491
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:31,510
Knucklehead, you got suspended

492
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,180
how you gonna sling for me?

493
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,915
So what you think?

494
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,385
I'm not trying to
 get in no trouble.

495
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:40,853
What, you don't think
 I get in trouble

496
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:44,023
for smuggling that
 letter to your man?

497
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:47,126
I'm looking out for
 you, like family.

498
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:52,031
All right.

499
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:55,167
All this good stuff,
 here look at this.

500
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:57,804
Fresh from the vending machine.

501
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:02,241
Thank you.

502
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:04,143
Thank you, so good.

503
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:06,012
So when you go back?

504
00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:08,915
- [Terry's Mom] Monday.

505
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:10,216
Are you sure the
doctor said it was okay

506
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,150
for you to come?

507
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,786
Well I had to come and
 see about you baby.

508
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:17,223
Make sure you were
 doing all right.

509
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,959
- [Terry] Well what'd they say?

510
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:21,393
Well...

511
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:22,862
They wanna do some more tests,

512
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:27,066
so I've gotta go back in
the hospital next week.

513
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:27,934
It's okay.

514
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:29,501
It's okay!

515
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,105
What are you doing
 here on a Saturday?

516
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:35,207
Couldn't stay away?

517
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:36,408
Ah...

518
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:39,278
I'm here checking
 in on the new girl.

519
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:41,280
Amy's dad is back again.

520
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:45,284
I'll try to get her to see him.

521
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:46,118
Sir...

522
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:47,153
Hey.

523
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:48,487
Nice to see you.

524
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:56,328
Thanks.

525
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:01,067
I don't know, I---

526
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,369
How are you doing
 today, Mrs. Easle?

527
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:04,236
Oh...

528
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:07,206
I'm hanging in there, DJ.

529
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:10,009
Your daughter is
 doing fantastic work.

530
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:12,845
But don't tell her I said that.

531
00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:14,613
Just counting down the
 days when I can make a

532
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,116
nice home-cooked
 meal for my baby.

533
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,284
- [DJ] I'll be looking forward

534
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:20,987
to my invitation to that dinner.

535
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:24,123
[Woman On Intercom]
 Visiting days are moved to

536
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:28,060
Wednesday, Saturday,
 and Sunday next month.

537
00:30:28,094 --> 00:30:28,895
- [Kid] Hi.

538
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:30,162
Oh...

539
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:31,197
Hello.

540
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,131
- [Kid] This is for you.

541
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,633
(chuckling) This is for me?

542
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,102
It's crazy.

543
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:39,238
Pedra's baby playing
 with Amy's daddy.

544
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:41,140
I made it myself.

545
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,308
Poor man.

546
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:47,379
Can't believe that girl's still
not talking to her father.

547
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:49,081
I put some lemon in it.

548
00:30:49,115 --> 00:30:50,016
One more?

549
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,219
Have you seen Ms. Scott?

550
00:30:53,252 --> 00:30:54,620
Nope.

551
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:56,122
No visitors today, Ms. Daniels?

552
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:57,623
Nope.

553
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:59,258
I thought your mother was
 coming to visit this weekend.

554
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,527
One of her yearly visits.

555
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,931
She said something came up.

556
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:08,901
Hang in there, all right?

557
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:13,072
(knocking)

558
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:15,574
Ms. Scott, your father's here.

559
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:16,442
Again?

560
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:26,218
See, here's the thing...

561
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:30,289
You're gonna have to
 face him sooner or later.

562
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,158
Why not today?

563
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:38,430
It's called Solitaire.

564
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:41,233
Okay.

565
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:44,370
I'll tell him.

566
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:48,074
I mean I know it hasn't
been easy in here...

567
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:50,609
Just two years, you know
all you've accomplished,

568
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:53,179
the Crew, and school work...

569
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:59,285
Remember what you told me
 when I first came in here?

570
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:03,289
"Don't think about how you're
 gonna fill up the years...

571
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:06,725
Just think about filling up
 the minute that you're in."

572
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,528
One step at a time.
 At a time.

573
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:14,633
Oh hey.

574
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,435
I'm sorry, she's not coming.

575
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,270
I'm sorry.

576
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:19,138
Okay.

577
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:31,317
All right, everyone.

578
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,352
Visiting hours are over.

579
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,622
Okay, bye mom.

580
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,460
Can momma get a hug?

581
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:43,395
Bye baby, I love you.

582
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:44,596
Bye mama, bye.

583
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:48,600
How are you today, Ms. Magavo?

584
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:52,604
"I'm fine DJ, and how are you?"

585
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:57,609
If I don't say that
 I get detention?

586
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:59,311
If you don't practice
 social graces,

587
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:01,680
the world closes up for you.

588
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:05,417
I thought you might be a fan.

589
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:09,421
It's a movie about Plato's cave.

590
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:12,658
I didn't ask you for that.

591
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,326
"Oh thank you, DJ."

592
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,761
"Thank you so much,
 I promise I won't

593
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:17,729
lose it or scratch it."

594
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:21,667
If I do, I get detention?

595
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,536
If you do, you'll disappoint me.

596
00:33:26,105 --> 00:33:29,041
I'm lending it to you
 because you have my trust...

597
00:33:29,075 --> 00:33:33,079
And that my dear, is more
 precious than any DVD.

598
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:40,152
- [Terry] Here they've been
 from their childhood...

599
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:41,620
And had their legs
 and necks chained

600
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:45,757
so they cannot move, and
 can only see before them.

601
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:49,195
And now look again, and see
 what would naturally follow

602
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:52,331
if one of the
 prisoners is released.

603
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:56,302
He will be required to grow
accustomed to the natural world.

604
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:59,238
At first, he will
 the shadows best.

605
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:02,774
Next, the reflections of
 the objects in the water,

606
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:06,212
and then the objects themselves.

607
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:08,314
Then he will gaze
 upon the stars,

608
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:10,182
and the spangled heavens,

609
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:12,251
in the light of the moon.

610
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:14,253
Last of all...

611
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:16,355
He will be able to see the sun,

612
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:20,259
in its own proper place,
and not in another.

613
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:31,270
Caroline.

614
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:49,721
That's his writing.

615
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:51,290
Thank you.

616
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:53,259
That's how we do it.

617
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:56,395
We look out for
 each other in here.

618
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,535
(chuckling)

619
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,808
Ms. Magavo.

620
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:14,346
Hello?

621
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,717
You want your DVD back?

622
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,553
Whenever you finish
 with it is fine.

623
00:35:21,587 --> 00:35:24,223
Listen, I spoke to one
 of your teachers today...

624
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:25,791
I didn't do nothing, okay?

625
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,827
It's anything, I
 didn't do anything.

626
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,429
Anyway...

627
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:33,399
He said he was impressed
with your schoolwork.

628
00:35:33,432 --> 00:35:34,900
- [Caroline] I'm
doing all right.

629
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:37,703
Except for the whole
 reading out loud part.

630
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:39,471
We would accomplish
 many more things

631
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:42,241
if we didn't think of
 them as impossible.

632
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:44,410
Who said that, Socrates again?

633
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:45,677
Nope.

634
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:49,448
Football coach by the
name of Vince Lombardi.

635
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:52,851
Terry, Keisha.

636
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,721
I need you to come see
 me when you're done.

637
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:56,755
Okay.
 All right.

638
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:59,258
- [DJ] Thank you ladies.

639
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:00,826
Hey...

640
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:02,294
Can I ask you something?

641
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:03,161
Why not?

642
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:09,601
How come they get to leave
 even if there's no fire?

643
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:13,205
Fighting fires isn't
 all they do, they...

644
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:15,874
Clear out camp sites,
 hiking trails...

645
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:18,444
They help out with
 natural disasters.

646
00:36:18,477 --> 00:36:21,213
It's a privilege they've earned.

647
00:36:21,247 --> 00:36:23,382
Stay out of trouble, I might
 let you test for the crew

648
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:24,850
when you turn 18.

649
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:31,156
I don't know.

650
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:36,662
Ah, you've got 90 days
 to think about it.

651
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,597
I hope you consider it.

652
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:42,434
Challenge yourself, Ms. Magavo.

653
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:53,312
Come in ladies.

654
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,649
I just got the date for
 your next parole hearing.

655
00:36:57,683 --> 00:36:59,351
It's in two weeks.

656
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:01,253
Finally, two weeks!

657
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:02,354
Two weeks.

658
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:03,322
Both of us?

659
00:37:03,355 --> 00:37:06,325
That is correct, same day.

660
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:07,092
Same day!

661
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:09,328
Let's not get
 ahead of ourselves.

662
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:10,729
This is not a done
 deal by any means,

663
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:11,997
it's just a hearing.

664
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,332
We got you.

665
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:20,272
I'm gonna catch up
 with you in a minute.

666
00:37:20,306 --> 00:37:23,909
I just wanted to say thank
 you, for everything DJ...

667
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:25,344
You don't even understand,

668
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:27,746
my mom needs me
 so much right now.

669
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,515
Thank you.

670
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:30,549
Oh, hey...

671
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:34,286
Oh I know, I know,
 you're not a hugger.

672
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,355
You don't need to thank me.

673
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:38,924
You put in all the hard work.

674
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:43,329
Aight, I'm gonna go call
 my mom with the good news.

675
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,031
That's great, baby.

676
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:47,399
When's the hearing?

677
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:48,734
Two weeks, mom.

678
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:49,601
- [Mrs. Easle] I'm
 hanging in there.

679
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:52,304
(chuckling) Yup.

680
00:37:52,338 --> 00:37:53,572
Just two weeks.

681
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:58,009
- [Mrs. Easle]
 You're my baby girl.

682
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,814
- [Inmate] Oh, they're
 tossing your cell.

683
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:04,049
Better run.

684
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:06,685
Hey, what are you
 doing with my stuff?

685
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:08,654
Keep better company and
this doesn't happen.

686
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:09,488
- [CO] The room's clean.

687
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:11,390
(laughing)

688
00:38:11,423 --> 00:38:12,223
Look at this.

689
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:14,426
She looks like she's
 five years old,

690
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,995
she's having a tea party.

691
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:20,799
Looks like she was
 spying on you, P.

692
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:24,370
That's not true,
I wasn't spying.

693
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:25,904
This is my grandpa.

694
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:27,406
You got no right
 to be drawing this

695
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:28,807
with our people,
this is private.

696
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,376
I didn't do anything wrong.

697
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:31,443
- [Tammy] Then why you
 hiding pictures of us

698
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:32,478
in your bed?

699
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:35,013
You drew my dad?

700
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,882
Why would you do that?

701
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:42,320
You don't want me
 to draw your dad?

702
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:44,390
There.

703
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:45,391
Are you happy?

704
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:50,929
There.

705
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:52,330
Are you happy?

706
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:02,941
Don't tear that up, please!

707
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:04,443
I'm saying, that
 looks more like my mom

708
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:07,345
than any picture I've ever seen.

709
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,381
Aw...

710
00:39:09,415 --> 00:39:11,650
(laughing)

711
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:18,123
Make her pay for it.

712
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:19,891
Terry's got a mama
 who puts money

713
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:21,159
in her commissary every week.

714
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,495
Nobody does that for you.

715
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:24,896
All right everyone, break it up.

716
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,399
Go on, go on, get your
stuff back in the room.

717
00:39:27,433 --> 00:39:28,133
Go on, Pedra.

718
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:32,871
Hey...

719
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:34,673
What you want for it?

720
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:42,180
I want a butterfly.

721
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,415
(laughing)

722
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:45,183
A butterfly...

723
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,085
They let you out
 of here every day,

724
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:49,821
shouldn't be too hard for you.

725
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:54,960
(police sirens)

726
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,497
- [Inmate] Hold the line.

727
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,798
Watch the wind!

728
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:06,738
Stay with it, stay with it.

729
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:09,775
(coughing)

730
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:10,742
- [Keisha] Amy!

731
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:12,678
- [Amy] Keisha, get out!

732
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:14,746
Terry, Keisha's in trouble!

733
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,915
Terry, Terry come here.

734
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:18,216
- [Terry] What?

735
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,818
- [Amy] Hurry up!

736
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:21,119
- [Terry] All right
 ladies, ladies don't stop,

737
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:22,821
hold the line all right?

738
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:25,090
Keep pushing, keep pushing.

739
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,560
Keep that coming.

740
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:36,234
Stay low, I'm here,
 I'm here Keisha.

741
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,737
(coughing)

742
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:42,941
(dramatic piano music)

743
00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:53,552
- [Amy] Oh no...

744
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:00,158
(coughing)

745
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:01,927
You did it!

746
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,161
Yeah, you did it!

747
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:08,266
Do not do that to me again,

748
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,602
do not ever, you hear me?

749
00:41:10,636 --> 00:41:12,804
- [Inmate] Great job guys!

750
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:24,115
That's right.

751
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,484
Thanks Cap, good job.

752
00:41:36,795 --> 00:41:38,229
Close, huh?

753
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:39,097
Yeah.

754
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:44,803
Nobody ever jumped
 through fire for me.

755
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:45,904
We sisters.

756
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:49,307
They say when you
 get out of here

757
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,743
and go back to your
 regular life...

758
00:41:51,777 --> 00:41:53,879
You forget about everybody
 you called family

759
00:41:53,912 --> 00:41:55,080
on the inside.

760
00:41:58,216 --> 00:42:01,587
I don't ever want
 to forget Crew Nine.

761
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,327
Aight, aight, aight.

762
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,129
Let's stop looking
 like crybabies.

763
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:14,165
The firefighters are passing by.

764
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,201
Oh, I got that one.

765
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:18,303
(laughing)

766
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:22,674
How are the girls?

767
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:24,175
A little shaken up,
but they'll never tell.

768
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:25,343
Yeah.

769
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,678
Hey DJ!

770
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:28,714
Terry made a Hail Mary.

771
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:30,115
That's a pass.

772
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:32,718
What Terry made was
 a wild kick return.

773
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:33,585
Oh yeah!

774
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,822
All I know is, I
 was saying Hail Mary

775
00:42:36,855 --> 00:42:38,690
before she got me out of there.

776
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:39,324
(laughing)

777
00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:40,926
She's my hero!

778
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:42,594
I hear you on that one.

779
00:42:42,628 --> 00:42:44,029
Good to see you in once piece.

780
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:46,732
- [Inmate] For real
 Keisha, that looked rough.

781
00:42:46,765 --> 00:42:49,935
Captain Kelly told
 me what happened.

782
00:42:51,136 --> 00:42:53,104
That's a heroic thing
 you did there, Terry.

783
00:42:53,138 --> 00:42:55,140
We had to keep
 Keisha alive, right?

784
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:58,376
We gotta get her to
 parole next week.

785
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,945
Hey ladies...

786
00:42:59,978 --> 00:43:02,213
Let's get Terry her butterfly.

787
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:03,281
Come on!

788
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:06,785
(laughing)

789
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:10,055
* Yeah we up, up,
 up in the clouds *

790
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,190
* Yeah we up

791
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:14,259
* Yeah we up

792
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:16,327
* Yeah we up

793
00:43:16,361 --> 00:43:17,428
* Yeah we up

794
00:43:17,462 --> 00:43:21,867
DJ, take a picture, take
 a picture, take a picture.

795
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:31,142
* Find your way, find your way

796
00:43:34,713 --> 00:43:38,149
* You're gonna get
 yourself a land *

797
00:43:38,183 --> 00:43:40,285
* You'll get it free

798
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:42,788
* You'll get it free

799
00:43:42,821 --> 00:43:46,725
* It's the way now, way to see

800
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,165
What are they doing?

801
00:43:55,033 --> 00:43:56,101
Being kids.

802
00:43:59,004 --> 00:44:00,338
(laughing)

803
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:03,775
Hey, I might have a
 new recruit for ya.

804
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:05,043
Now that's what I want to hear.

805
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:05,711
Yes sir.

806
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,049
Does finding a dead one count?

807
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:13,084
We could just tell
 her it's asleep.

808
00:44:13,118 --> 00:44:15,921
She didn't say it
 had to be alive.

809
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:17,322
Yeah...

810
00:44:17,355 --> 00:44:18,690
Done and done.

811
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:22,227
It looks completely different

812
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,962
from the one I saw before.

813
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:25,764
It looks like a
 roach with wings.

814
00:44:25,797 --> 00:44:28,266
(laughing)

815
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:29,467
They're all different.

816
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,903
They got crazy bugs
 in the country.

817
00:44:31,937 --> 00:44:33,471
(laughing)

818
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,741
I never been to
 the country before.

819
00:44:35,774 --> 00:44:37,776
Maybe you should think
about joining Crew Nine.

820
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:38,409
- [Amy] Yeah, you should.

821
00:44:38,443 --> 00:44:39,344
Right?

822
00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:40,812
We leave this place every day.

823
00:44:40,846 --> 00:44:42,213
Every day.

824
00:44:42,247 --> 00:44:43,749
I don't think so.

825
00:44:43,782 --> 00:44:45,183
Why not?

826
00:44:45,216 --> 00:44:47,318
You could train to be a
 firefighter, help people out.

827
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:48,820
That ain't me.

828
00:44:48,854 --> 00:44:50,288
How do you know, Caroline?

829
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:51,356
How do you know that's not you

830
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:54,259
if you haven't even tried it?

831
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:57,328
- [Caroline] You got DJ
 making you the boss of things.

832
00:44:57,362 --> 00:44:59,765
He's willing to help you too.

833
00:44:59,798 --> 00:45:01,733
And you got your
 moms driving up here

834
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:03,201
every weekend to visit you.

835
00:45:03,234 --> 00:45:04,502
So?

836
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:05,871
You got people telling you

837
00:45:05,904 --> 00:45:09,274
you weren't made for this place.

838
00:45:09,307 --> 00:45:12,944
But all my life, they've
been telling me I was.

839
00:45:12,978 --> 00:45:16,247
What, you trying to buy
her artwork with a bug?

840
00:45:16,281 --> 00:45:18,349
(laughing)

841
00:45:24,122 --> 00:45:25,456
You don't speak for Caroline.

842
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:27,192
Yeah I do.

843
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:29,227
She's down with me.

844
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,863
We don't get paid with insects.

845
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:36,434
Then take your butterfly back.

846
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:40,471
Terry...

847
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,274
Nah.

848
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:45,276
Come on.

849
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:50,215
You're going to have
 a lot of peer pressure

850
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:53,484
on the outside to
 make wrong decisions.

851
00:45:55,854 --> 00:45:58,023
Coming back in here is a choice,

852
00:45:58,056 --> 00:46:01,259
and it won't happen unless
 you allow it to happen.

853
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:02,994
Just like that, huh?

854
00:46:03,028 --> 00:46:04,295
If that's what you think,

855
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:05,496
you have no idea what it's like

856
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:07,298
for some of us out there.

857
00:46:07,332 --> 00:46:09,801
Well let's talk about it.

858
00:46:10,936 --> 00:46:12,003
Forget it.

859
00:46:12,037 --> 00:46:13,238
Pedra...

860
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:15,340
You can't bring stuff up
and then just drop it.

861
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:18,509
It doesn't help you, it
doesn't help the group.

862
00:46:18,543 --> 00:46:21,379
You really want to
 know what it's like?

863
00:46:21,412 --> 00:46:22,247
Tell me.

864
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:25,783
Well...

865
00:46:28,954 --> 00:46:31,256
I know a girl in here...

866
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:35,360
Who had to steal food, just
 so she wouldn't starve.

867
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:36,561
Her parents were so strung out

868
00:46:36,594 --> 00:46:39,998
they forgot to feed
 her for a week.

869
00:46:40,031 --> 00:46:41,867
That's so messed up.

870
00:46:43,101 --> 00:46:46,938
That must've been a
tough situation for her.

871
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:49,941
That's why me and my girls

872
00:46:49,975 --> 00:46:51,843
got each other's backs.

873
00:46:51,877 --> 00:46:53,011
We look out for each other,

874
00:46:53,044 --> 00:46:55,113
I mean we got our own family.

875
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:57,082
And we get mad respect.

876
00:46:58,249 --> 00:47:00,385
Yeah, but not everybody
wants a gangsta life.

877
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:03,955
Amy, what do you even
 know about gangs?

878
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:05,556
Uh, I was just trying
 to make a point.

879
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:07,358
Talking about something you
 don't know nothing about.

880
00:47:07,392 --> 00:47:11,963
Maybe she don't, but I do
 know something about it Pedra.

881
00:47:11,997 --> 00:47:14,365
That for some of us...

882
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:16,601
Maybe not you, cause we
 all know how proud you are

883
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:18,236
to call yourself a gangsta,

884
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:20,205
but for some of us...

885
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:28,246
Joining a gang is more
about having protection,

886
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:30,481
especially in the hood.

887
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:34,219
Where somebody got
 killed every day.

888
00:47:34,252 --> 00:47:35,887
Hey, sit down.

889
00:47:35,921 --> 00:47:38,256
I'm just going to my cell.

890
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:41,326
Let's go.

891
00:47:45,964 --> 00:47:47,966
We're not done, Pedra.

892
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:49,935
I am.

893
00:47:52,437 --> 00:47:54,605
All right, come on.

894
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:56,641
Back to your cells, come on.

895
00:47:56,674 --> 00:47:59,477
Amy, how's your father?

896
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:02,613
Did you make contact with
 him like we discussed?

897
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:04,082
Not yet.

898
00:48:04,115 --> 00:48:07,518
Would it help if I
 facilitated a meeting?

899
00:48:09,454 --> 00:48:10,922
Can I think about it?

900
00:48:10,956 --> 00:48:11,589
Sure.

901
00:48:13,992 --> 00:48:16,194
How's your mom, Terry?

902
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:18,563
Back in the hospital.

903
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:19,998
So unlike some of ya'll,

904
00:48:20,031 --> 00:48:22,300
I can't wait to
 get up outta here.

905
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:23,134
(laughing)

906
00:48:23,168 --> 00:48:24,235
We ready.

907
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:25,603
I think she was talking to...

908
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:27,005
Me, right?

909
00:48:27,038 --> 00:48:27,672
I think...

910
00:48:27,705 --> 00:48:30,175
(laughing)

911
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:32,110
Just keeping it real.

912
00:48:34,112 --> 00:48:35,413
Caroline, right?

913
00:48:36,681 --> 00:48:37,949
Mhm.

914
00:48:37,983 --> 00:48:38,984
You gonna be
 finishing high school

915
00:48:39,017 --> 00:48:41,052
while you're in here.

916
00:48:41,086 --> 00:48:43,288
That's a really
 big accomplishment.

917
00:48:43,321 --> 00:48:47,058
Everybody sweats this
chick like she's smart,

918
00:48:47,092 --> 00:48:50,128
when she's just some
 dude's sidepiece.

919
00:48:50,161 --> 00:48:52,497
You shoulda heard the
letter he wrote to him.

920
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,232
"I don't care what
 you did to me..."

921
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:55,433
Stop it.

922
00:48:55,466 --> 00:48:56,634
We all come here
 to help each other,

923
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,269
how are you being helpful?

924
00:48:58,303 --> 00:49:00,405
By telling her she should
 read her schoolbooks

925
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:01,539
and educate herself

926
00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:03,141
instead of writing
 letters to a dude

927
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:04,976
that got her busted.

928
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:07,678
I didn't finish 8th
 grade and I know that.

929
00:49:07,712 --> 00:49:08,646
I read a lot.

930
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:11,416
The only thing you're reading...

931
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:15,320
Is homeboy's letters, like
 an ignorant sidepiece.

932
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:21,026
I read Plato's cave thing,
 so mind your business.

933
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,629
You read Plato's Republic?

934
00:49:26,364 --> 00:49:27,632
Yeah, that cave thing.

935
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:29,167
That's that big old fat book

936
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,269
Terry be carrying around.

937
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:32,437
You lying!

938
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,105
(laughing)

939
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:35,373
If you really read it,
 what's your favorite part?

940
00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:36,574
Cause Terry will
know the answer.

941
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:40,311
You don't have to
 answer that, Caroline.

942
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:46,251
My favorite part is
 when the prisoner

943
00:49:46,284 --> 00:49:48,719
goes back down into the cave

944
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:52,523
and tells everyone
about the world up top.

945
00:49:52,557 --> 00:49:55,526
All the other prisoners
think he's crazy

946
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,062
and laugh at him.

947
00:49:57,095 --> 00:50:00,331
What kind of stupid
 stuff is she saying?

948
00:50:00,365 --> 00:50:01,466
They say...

949
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:06,771
"Don't even think about
 looking up into the light,

950
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:10,641
if it's gonna make
 you like that."

951
00:50:12,377 --> 00:50:13,378
It's like...

952
00:50:14,545 --> 00:50:18,316
Everything you thought you
 ever knew was true, isn't...

953
00:50:28,493 --> 00:50:30,661
(bell ringing)

954
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:32,263
Same time next week, ladies.

955
00:50:32,297 --> 00:50:34,565
And please leave the
 attitudes in the cell,

956
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:37,768
so we can actually
 get some work done.

957
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,372
You can handle more
 than you think.

958
00:50:41,406 --> 00:50:44,075
Did Socrates say that too?

959
00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:44,742
My mom.

960
00:50:46,444 --> 00:50:48,479
When her pain get real bad.

961
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,816
- [Officer] Okay, let's go.

962
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:02,193
Just try to relax, read
from your statements,

963
00:51:02,227 --> 00:51:03,661
and be honest with
 the parole board

964
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:06,797
no matter what they
 ask you, hear me?

965
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:10,468
Now you're here because
you deserve to be here,

966
00:51:10,501 --> 00:51:13,504
so I need you to
 own responsibility.

967
00:51:15,306 --> 00:51:17,308
They're ready for you.

968
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:23,281
(soft instrumental music)

969
00:51:53,578 --> 00:51:54,412
Yes, no?

970
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:58,749
Yes!

971
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:01,252
(laughing)

972
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:04,655
You ready?

973
00:52:04,689 --> 00:52:05,523
Yeah.

974
00:52:08,293 --> 00:52:09,794
[Man On Parole Board]
 Ms. Easle, sit down.

975
00:52:09,827 --> 00:52:11,296
Good afternoon.

976
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:12,530
Good afternoon.

977
00:52:16,501 --> 00:52:18,336
Well it looks like all
 your paperwork is in order,

978
00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:20,571
anything you'd like to say?

979
00:52:20,605 --> 00:52:21,439
Yes sir.

980
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:29,914
Excuse me.

981
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:40,225
The night of March
12th, three years ago...

982
00:52:40,258 --> 00:52:42,660
Was the worst night of my life.

983
00:52:43,794 --> 00:52:48,233
And one that has haunted
me every day since.

984
00:52:48,266 --> 00:52:51,569
(drowned out radio music)

985
00:53:07,485 --> 00:53:09,620
(loud bump)

986
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:27,638
(crying and heavy breathing)

987
00:53:42,487 --> 00:53:45,923
It's okay, it's okay,
 it's okay, it's okay.

988
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:46,957
It's okay...

989
00:53:53,798 --> 00:53:57,502
I wish I could say I
 didn't know better...

990
00:54:00,438 --> 00:54:01,272
But I did.

991
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,375
I did know better.

992
00:54:04,409 --> 00:54:06,477
I should've stayed
 and not run away.

993
00:54:06,511 --> 00:54:07,712
- [Newscaster] And
 our news on the hour,

994
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,480
the woman in the
 hit and run accident

995
00:54:09,514 --> 00:54:11,682
which occurred on Magnolia
 Drive and Piedmont

996
00:54:11,716 --> 00:54:13,751
late last night has died.

997
00:54:13,784 --> 00:54:15,420
The investigation is ongoing,

998
00:54:15,453 --> 00:54:18,356
and investigators are following
several leads this morning.

999
00:54:18,389 --> 00:54:19,657
Including an apparent witness

1000
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:21,492
who had seen the vehicle
fleeing the scene.

1001
00:54:21,526 --> 00:54:23,794
(knocking)

1002
00:54:24,895 --> 00:54:26,497
- [Mrs. Easle] Terry,
 you okay in there?

1003
00:54:26,531 --> 00:54:28,699
I'll be out in a minute, mom.

1004
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:32,470
Well come on, you gonna
be late for school.

1005
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:37,508
I'm going to work.

1006
00:54:40,044 --> 00:54:43,714
(somber instrumental music)

1007
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:20,885
Hey...

1008
00:55:20,918 --> 00:55:22,086
That's my car.

1009
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:27,425
- [Officer] Let's go ma'am.

1010
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:49,547
- [Ms. Easle] No,
 it's a mistake.

1011
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,015
It's not my baby.

1012
00:56:07,765 --> 00:56:10,735
Look, I just want
 ya'll to know that

1013
00:56:10,768 --> 00:56:15,506
I've been trying to make
up for it every day.

1014
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:19,610
And I'll continue to do that
 for the rest of my life.

1015
00:56:19,644 --> 00:56:20,478
Thank you.

1016
00:56:22,447 --> 00:56:26,984
You've accomplished quite
 a bit in your time here.

1017
00:56:27,017 --> 00:56:29,420
You've completed
several college courses,

1018
00:56:29,454 --> 00:56:31,422
no alcohol or drug abuse,

1019
00:56:31,456 --> 00:56:33,458
and I see that recently
you were made the lead

1020
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:35,159
of Crew Nine.

1021
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:36,561
Yes sir.

1022
00:56:36,594 --> 00:56:38,128
Still, I don't see
 why we should give you

1023
00:56:38,162 --> 00:56:39,497
an early parole.

1024
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:42,933
So, I'm kinda on the fence here.

1025
00:56:42,967 --> 00:56:44,535
Where do you stand?

1026
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:49,173
I'm recommending parole.

1027
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:50,407
Thank you.

1028
00:56:53,511 --> 00:56:54,144
I am...

1029
00:56:55,513 --> 00:56:59,550
Impressed with your
accomplishments in here.

1030
00:56:59,584 --> 00:57:02,720
Out there, you left
 the scene of a crime.

1031
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:05,890
Yes sir, I made a
 terrible mistake.

1032
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:10,227
Let's see, you hit the
 victim, you stopped,

1033
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:13,498
and you drove away
 and left her to die.

1034
00:57:19,236 --> 00:57:21,772
I was young and
 scared and stupid.

1035
00:57:21,806 --> 00:57:24,842
We're well aware of what
teenagers are capable of

1036
00:57:24,875 --> 00:57:28,045
when they're scared,
 I have three of them.

1037
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:29,714
But this was way beyond that,

1038
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:32,550
way beyond being scared stupid.

1039
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,488
You were more concerned about

1040
00:57:37,522 --> 00:57:40,224
what would happen to you
 if you got caught driving

1041
00:57:40,257 --> 00:57:41,959
without a license

1042
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:43,794
than the woman who
 was bleeding to death

1043
00:57:43,828 --> 00:57:45,062
under your car.

1044
00:57:46,531 --> 00:57:49,199
You frighten me, Ms. Easle.

1045
00:57:49,233 --> 00:57:52,637
And no college courses
or firefighting training

1046
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:55,606
is enough to set
my mind at ease.

1047
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,576
I'm denying parole.

1048
00:58:01,912 --> 00:58:03,280
DJ, I don't like the wording

1049
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:06,083
in her psychological
 evaluation, it's ambiguous.

1050
00:58:06,116 --> 00:58:07,685
Nr. Lewis.

1051
00:58:07,718 --> 00:58:09,720
As you know, her state of
 mind has never been an issue

1052
00:58:09,754 --> 00:58:11,589
at any of her hearings.

1053
00:58:11,622 --> 00:58:13,858
Well it is an issue now.

1054
00:58:13,891 --> 00:58:15,593
I want specific
 language that states

1055
00:58:15,626 --> 00:58:19,263
that if Ms. Easle found
herself in a similar situation,

1056
00:58:19,296 --> 00:58:22,600
her counselor
 categorically is convinced

1057
00:58:22,633 --> 00:58:25,936
that she would not
make the same decision.

1058
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,275
I'm denying her parole.

1059
00:58:32,276 --> 00:58:33,210
If the paperwork is revised,

1060
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:37,281
she can come back again
in 90 days, thank you.

1061
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,584
DJ...

1062
00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:41,752
Wait, wait, wait.

1063
00:58:41,786 --> 00:58:43,554
No, wait, wait.

1064
00:58:43,588 --> 00:58:45,122
Please...

1065
00:58:45,155 --> 00:58:47,057
May I say something, please?

1066
00:58:47,091 --> 00:58:49,293
This girl's mother
 is in the hospital.

1067
00:58:49,326 --> 00:58:50,761
Now she's very sick.

1068
00:58:50,795 --> 00:58:53,297
I'm asking you as a
 personal favor to me,

1069
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:55,232
to please reconsider
 your decision.

1070
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:57,802
I've made my ruling.

1071
00:58:57,835 --> 00:59:01,138
She can come back
 again in 90 days.

1072
00:59:01,171 --> 00:59:02,740
Now good afternoon.

1073
00:59:04,108 --> 00:59:07,778
(somber instrumental music)

1074
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:41,178
Listen, I need a favor.

1075
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:43,313
I need to take these with you,

1076
00:59:43,347 --> 00:59:46,583
see what you can do
 with them at school.

1077
00:59:47,284 --> 00:59:49,319
I'm not doing that.

1078
00:59:49,353 --> 00:59:50,354
Your man needs the cash,

1079
00:59:50,387 --> 00:59:52,623
you don't want to let him down.

1080
00:59:52,657 --> 00:59:53,357
He let me down.

1081
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:56,260
Forget him, you keep the cash.

1082
00:59:58,963 --> 01:00:01,065
I'm not doing it, Pedra.

1083
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:03,300
The guards hardly ever go
 in the school bathroom,

1084
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:04,669
it's easy money.

1085
01:00:05,803 --> 01:00:06,671
You may not want
 to get out of here,

1086
01:00:06,704 --> 01:00:08,272
but I do.

1087
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:10,307
You think I don't want
 to get out of here?

1088
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,877
I got a family on the
 outside to support.

1089
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:14,611
They depend on me.

1090
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:16,313
So...

1091
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:20,284
I gotta do what I gotta do.

1092
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:31,261
And I gotta do what I gotta do.

1093
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:34,965
You walk away from me mama,

1094
01:00:34,999 --> 01:00:37,968
you better walk yourself
into protective custody.

1095
01:00:38,002 --> 01:00:39,870
I did you favors.

1096
01:00:39,904 --> 01:00:41,438
You owe me.

1097
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,374
You sling for me or
 you bleed for me.

1098
01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:51,281
My arms feel like
they're gonna fall off.

1099
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:53,117
Oketa, stop whining.

1100
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,852
Too bad it's not your mouth.

1101
01:00:54,885 --> 01:00:56,954
Really don't know why ya'll
 standing around here laughing

1102
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:59,156
when we got this bus to clean.

1103
01:00:59,189 --> 01:01:01,291
Terry, you've been
pushing us hard all day.

1104
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:04,094
It's not our fault
 you didn't get parole.

1105
01:01:04,128 --> 01:01:04,962
Amy...

1106
01:01:06,964 --> 01:01:08,398
You can chill inside, aight?

1107
01:01:08,432 --> 01:01:09,934
I'll do it myself.

1108
01:01:09,967 --> 01:01:12,302
Look, we all really
 wanted you to make it.

1109
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:14,071
You're not the only
 one working here.

1110
01:01:14,104 --> 01:01:15,773
Hit the showers ladies.

1111
01:01:15,806 --> 01:01:16,707
No, but--

1112
01:01:16,741 --> 01:01:19,777
Ms. Easle has it under control.

1113
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:21,311
You pushed them hard today.

1114
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:23,380
I'm crew leader, that's my job.

1115
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:25,049
A good crew leader knows when to

1116
01:01:25,082 --> 01:01:26,250
take care of her crew.

1117
01:01:26,283 --> 01:01:27,384
My moms is the only
 one who needs me

1118
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:29,286
to take care of her.

1119
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:31,388
Ms. Easle...

1120
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:33,257
I just want to do a good job,

1121
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:37,494
and get good evaluations so
 I can get back to her, okay?

1122
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,263
- [DJ] I'm not interested
 in evaluations.

1123
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:41,265
Parole board is.

1124
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:43,067
I'm interested in
 Terry the person.

1125
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:43,734
Well...

1126
01:01:45,803 --> 01:01:48,405
Terry's not such a good person.

1127
01:01:52,342 --> 01:01:54,278
You heard what I did.

1128
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:00,951
Can I just do my work?

1129
01:02:01,886 --> 01:02:02,719
Okay.

1130
01:02:53,403 --> 01:02:55,039
Where's Caroline?

1131
01:02:55,072 --> 01:02:58,042
She put herself in
 protective custody.

1132
01:02:58,075 --> 01:02:59,476
Left all her trash.

1133
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:08,385
You will do your
schoolwork in your cell.

1134
01:03:08,418 --> 01:03:10,387
You will have one
 hour of yard time

1135
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:12,222
when the yard will be
 clear of all prisoners

1136
01:03:12,256 --> 01:03:14,424
for your protection.

1137
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:18,195
Your meals will be served
 through this hatch.

1138
01:03:19,396 --> 01:03:22,432
Who's threatening you, Caroline?

1139
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:24,835
I'm cool.

1140
01:03:24,869 --> 01:03:26,470
You are not cool.

1141
01:03:38,048 --> 01:03:40,317
(laughing)

1142
01:03:42,953 --> 01:03:44,889
Get off those tables.

1143
01:03:55,032 --> 01:03:55,866
Sit down.

1144
01:04:07,411 --> 01:04:11,381
Whatever's going on with
Caroline is gonna stop.

1145
01:04:11,415 --> 01:04:12,249
Right now.

1146
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:16,253
If it doesn't, you
 are gonna be spending

1147
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:17,521
the rest of your time here...

1148
01:04:17,554 --> 01:04:18,488
Look at me!

1149
01:04:20,124 --> 01:04:21,959
You are gonna be spending
 the rest of your time

1150
01:04:21,992 --> 01:04:23,427
in a detention cell.

1151
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:25,362
Do I make myself clear?

1152
01:04:27,564 --> 01:04:28,398
Answer me!

1153
01:04:32,136 --> 01:04:32,970
Yes sir.

1154
01:04:41,511 --> 01:04:43,247
Dang, DJ...

1155
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,581
I'm scared of you.

1156
01:04:48,285 --> 01:04:50,120
How are you feeling?

1157
01:04:51,188 --> 01:04:53,157
I'm nervous.

1158
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:54,992
That's natural.

1159
01:04:55,025 --> 01:04:56,026
But you're ready.

1160
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:57,361
Just remember everything

1161
01:04:57,394 --> 01:04:59,196
that you learned with the Crew,

1162
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:02,632
and continue to stay
 focused on your goals.

1163
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:04,668
I can call you, right?

1164
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:07,637
You better.

1165
01:05:12,542 --> 01:05:13,543
Love, Amy.

1166
01:05:16,113 --> 01:05:17,381
You better write...

1167
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:19,083
Every week.

1168
01:05:19,116 --> 01:05:20,550
(laughing)

1169
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:21,952
You know it.

1170
01:05:27,992 --> 01:05:28,625
You came!

1171
01:05:34,131 --> 01:05:36,166
You know I wouldn't miss this.

1172
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,101
Wow...

1173
01:05:37,134 --> 01:05:39,403
Keisha, your ride is here.

1174
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:41,371
Group hug!

1175
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,375
- [Amy] One, two, three...

1176
01:05:45,409 --> 01:05:47,244
- [Group] Crew Nine!

1177
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:48,278
Crew Nine!

1178
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:51,681
I just want to say...

1179
01:05:51,715 --> 01:05:55,052
It should be you going home.

1180
01:05:55,085 --> 01:05:56,720
Keisha Daniels...

1181
01:05:56,753 --> 01:06:00,357
You deserve this
 as much as anybody.

1182
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:03,293
Thanks for always
 having my back.

1183
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,398
All right, all right.

1184
01:06:10,767 --> 01:06:12,969
We'll miss you Keisha.

1185
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:18,575
- [Inmate] Bye Keisha.

1186
01:06:18,608 --> 01:06:21,511
- [Other Inmate] Bye Keisha.

1187
01:06:21,545 --> 01:06:25,515
(acoustic guitar
 instrumental music)

1188
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,434
Bye!

1189
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:56,713
- [Captain Kelly] DJ...

1190
01:06:56,746 --> 01:06:58,615
You gonna get me
 some new recruits?

1191
01:06:58,648 --> 01:07:00,284
Well I'm...

1192
01:07:00,317 --> 01:07:02,519
You know, I'm going over
 the files of the new girls.

1193
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:04,188
A lot of young ladies
 coming in on meds

1194
01:07:04,221 --> 01:07:07,824
and dealing with psychological
 issues, violent offenses.

1195
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:10,127
I'm not seeing anybody stable
 enough for the program.

1196
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,261
Well it's getting
 thin out there,

1197
01:07:11,295 --> 01:07:13,430
we can't run the
program without bodies.

1198
01:07:13,463 --> 01:07:14,364
Ah, yes.

1199
01:07:14,398 --> 01:07:16,466
But it's the quality
 of the girls, Kelly,

1200
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,435
not the quantity.

1201
01:07:18,468 --> 01:07:20,437
DJ, I'm serious!

1202
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:23,407
What are you gonna
 do about it, DJ?

1203
01:07:27,577 --> 01:07:29,379
Hey.

1204
01:07:29,413 --> 01:07:31,148
Thanks for the picture.

1205
01:07:31,181 --> 01:07:33,517
My mom's gonna love
 those butterflies.

1206
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:34,851
Can't wait to show it to her.

1207
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:37,454
Sorry you didn't make parole.

1208
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:41,158
It's all good.

1209
01:07:42,326 --> 01:07:44,661
Did you really read
 Plato's Republic?

1210
01:07:44,694 --> 01:07:46,363
Saw the movie.

1211
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:49,533
(chuckling) I could
 lend you my copy.

1212
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:51,368
That book's too hard for me.

1213
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:52,802
You sell yourself short.

1214
01:07:52,836 --> 01:07:56,473
I'm gonna see if DJ will let
 me get it for you, all right?

1215
01:07:56,506 --> 01:07:59,509
Hang out here for a minute.

1216
01:07:59,543 --> 01:08:01,578
Where else am I gonna go?

1217
01:08:09,553 --> 01:08:10,420
Aight.

1218
01:08:10,454 --> 01:08:13,523
So first of all, it's
 not the cave thing.

1219
01:08:13,557 --> 01:08:15,225
This is a book about Socrates.

1220
01:08:15,259 --> 01:08:18,262
His ideas, his story, his life.

1221
01:08:18,295 --> 01:08:20,830
The cave, just one of
 the stories in there.

1222
01:08:20,864 --> 01:08:24,401
(uplifting piano music)

1223
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:35,412
Hustle ladies!

1224
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:37,581
How you doing with the book?

1225
01:08:40,184 --> 01:08:43,553
And all of what are
 now called realities.

1226
01:08:45,222 --> 01:08:48,558
I don't understand any of this.

1227
01:08:48,592 --> 01:08:51,495
Well, we're gonna keep
 reading over and over

1228
01:08:51,528 --> 01:08:52,562
'til you do.

1229
01:08:52,596 --> 01:08:54,764
Anyone tried to lose another,

1230
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:57,534
and lead him back
 into the light.

1231
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:01,171
I lost where I'm at.

1232
01:09:01,205 --> 01:09:02,672
Stop fidgeting, concentrate.

1233
01:09:02,706 --> 01:09:05,509
Socrates looked
 at him and said...

1234
01:09:05,542 --> 01:09:07,377
"How charming the man is..."

1235
01:09:07,411 --> 01:09:09,913
(laughing)

1236
01:09:09,946 --> 01:09:11,581
"Since I've been imprisoned,

1237
01:09:11,615 --> 01:09:14,518
he's always been
 coming to see me."

1238
01:09:17,221 --> 01:09:19,556
Let them only
 catch the offender,

1239
01:09:19,589 --> 01:09:21,225
and they will be put to death.

1240
01:09:21,258 --> 01:09:22,726
What does that mean?

1241
01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:24,694
That some people get
 mad at the people

1242
01:09:24,728 --> 01:09:26,696
who try to help them.

1243
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:27,797
See?

1244
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:28,732
You get it.

1245
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:32,502
I was mad at you and DJ.

1246
01:09:32,536 --> 01:09:34,504
(laughing)

1247
01:09:34,538 --> 01:09:36,540
We must do as he says, Crito.

1248
01:09:36,573 --> 01:09:39,409
And therefore, let
 the cup be brought.

1249
01:09:39,443 --> 01:09:41,878
If the poison is
 prepared, if not...

1250
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:44,481
Let the attendant prepare some.

1251
01:09:47,451 --> 01:09:50,554
He's gonna drink
the hemlock now.

1252
01:09:50,587 --> 01:09:51,621
Yup.

1253
01:09:51,655 --> 01:09:54,424
Couple more pages and
 Socrates' life will be over.

1254
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:56,860
Three more pages and...

1255
01:09:56,893 --> 01:10:01,565
We won't be sitting
here reading it anymore.

1256
01:10:01,598 --> 01:10:04,301
Excuse me for interrupting.

1257
01:10:04,334 --> 01:10:06,570
Happy birthday, Ms. Magavo.

1258
01:10:08,505 --> 01:10:10,507
My wife made it for you.

1259
01:10:13,577 --> 01:10:14,544
Thanks.

1260
01:10:14,578 --> 01:10:16,246
It's your birthday and
 you ain't tell nobody?

1261
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:17,747
Her 18th birthday.

1262
01:10:18,615 --> 01:10:19,816
Which means...

1263
01:10:19,849 --> 01:10:22,519
In a few weeks when
 she hits her 90 days,

1264
01:10:22,552 --> 01:10:25,255
she'll be old enough
 to test for the Crew.

1265
01:10:25,289 --> 01:10:26,756
Who said I'm testing for Crew?

1266
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:30,627
You have something
 better to do, Ms. Magavo?

1267
01:10:34,298 --> 01:10:36,333
I'm not leaving PC.

1268
01:10:36,366 --> 01:10:39,469
If you joined up, you wouldn't
 need protective custody.

1269
01:10:39,503 --> 01:10:41,805
Crew Nine will have your back.

1270
01:10:50,514 --> 01:10:53,317
I'm not going back out there.

1271
01:10:55,552 --> 01:10:56,653
Caroline...

1272
01:11:05,629 --> 01:11:08,031
- [Firefighter] Let's move out.

1273
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:13,036
(acoustic instrumental music)

1274
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,789
What a shame.

1275
01:11:32,822 --> 01:11:34,491
There's Terry.

1276
01:11:34,524 --> 01:11:35,559
Terry.

1277
01:11:38,562 --> 01:11:39,696
We need to talk.

1278
01:11:44,401 --> 01:11:46,670
(knocking)

1279
01:11:49,573 --> 01:11:50,540
How are you?

1280
01:11:55,912 --> 01:11:57,514
Hey, what happened?

1281
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:17,501
Your mom?

1282
01:12:22,506 --> 01:12:23,540
Did she...

1283
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:31,915
She's gone.

1284
01:12:34,584 --> 01:12:35,519
She died...

1285
01:12:36,653 --> 01:12:37,487
Alone.

1286
01:12:41,891 --> 01:12:43,593
Finish it, please.

1287
01:12:57,140 --> 01:13:00,043
Now I was at the first...

1288
01:13:00,076 --> 01:13:02,746
For Crito, when he found himself

1289
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:08,518
unable to restrain his tears.

1290
01:13:08,552 --> 01:13:11,521
I got up, and I followed...

1291
01:13:11,555 --> 01:13:13,590
And at that moment,

1292
01:13:13,623 --> 01:13:16,793
Apollodorus who had been
weeping all the time

1293
01:13:16,826 --> 01:13:19,996
broke out in a loud
 and passionate cry

1294
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:23,667
which made cowards of us all.

1295
01:13:39,683 --> 01:13:41,651
(buzzing)

1296
01:13:48,792 --> 01:13:51,795
Why is Terry not
 dressed for Crew?

1297
01:13:54,531 --> 01:13:55,665
Did she say something to you?

1298
01:13:55,699 --> 01:13:56,533
No.

1299
01:13:59,669 --> 01:14:01,538
(knocking)

1300
01:14:01,571 --> 01:14:02,205
Come in.

1301
01:14:04,207 --> 01:14:06,643
I wanted to talk to
 you about the Crew.

1302
01:14:06,676 --> 01:14:07,511
Okay.

1303
01:14:15,218 --> 01:14:17,086
I've done a lot of
thinking this past week,

1304
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,955
and I decided to quit.

1305
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:23,092
Okay...

1306
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:25,662
And you want to tell me why?

1307
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:32,736
I can't lead the
 Crew right now, DJ.

1308
01:14:32,769 --> 01:14:34,037
I understand.

1309
01:14:35,171 --> 01:14:38,241
You can come back
 whenever you're ready.

1310
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:42,612
My mom...

1311
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:49,619
She knew what I did.

1312
01:14:49,653 --> 01:14:52,656
She heard everything in court.

1313
01:14:52,689 --> 01:14:57,160
But she never saw me the
 way thar parole board did.

1314
01:14:57,193 --> 01:14:58,094
Listen...

1315
01:15:06,636 --> 01:15:07,704
Listen to me.

1316
01:15:08,705 --> 01:15:11,808
It doesn't matter what
 they parole board saw.

1317
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:14,844
You did Crew because
 of who you are.

1318
01:15:15,945 --> 01:15:19,248
You helped Keisha
because of who you are.

1319
01:15:19,282 --> 01:15:21,985
You've become apart
 of the solution,

1320
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:23,553
that's who I see.

1321
01:15:23,587 --> 01:15:24,220
Hear me?

1322
01:15:26,723 --> 01:15:29,793
We get up in the morning,
 we do what we gotta do.

1323
01:15:29,826 --> 01:15:31,060
Hear me?

1324
01:15:31,094 --> 01:15:31,928
The same.

1325
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:40,036
Except you get to go
 home to your family,

1326
01:15:40,069 --> 01:15:43,573
and I've got nothing
 left to go home to.

1327
01:15:45,241 --> 01:15:47,210
I just don't see
 the point anymore.

1328
01:15:47,243 --> 01:15:51,114
Then what's the point
 of me joining Crew?

1329
01:15:51,147 --> 01:15:55,084
You promised if I came
back out, you'd help me.

1330
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:03,993
* I'm coming home,
 I'm coming home *

1331
01:16:04,027 --> 01:16:07,797
* Tell the world
 I'm coming home *

1332
01:16:07,831 --> 01:16:11,668
* Let the rain wash away

1333
01:16:11,701 --> 01:16:14,871
* All the pain of yesterday

1334
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:18,708
* I know my kingdom awaits

1335
01:16:19,743 --> 01:16:20,810
You go Caroline!

1336
01:16:20,844 --> 01:16:24,080
I can't go any
 further with this bag.

1337
01:16:25,715 --> 01:16:26,916
I know.

1338
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:28,384
Let's go!

1339
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:29,653
Come on.

1340
01:16:32,656 --> 01:16:34,658
Keep those elbows
 out, elbows out.

1341
01:16:34,691 --> 01:16:36,325
You got it, you got it.

1342
01:16:36,359 --> 01:16:38,662
Come on, a little harder.

1343
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:46,703
(clapping and cheering)

1344
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:03,720
- [Inmate] Do it!

1345
01:17:03,753 --> 01:17:05,689
- [Inmate] You go girl.

1346
01:17:10,326 --> 01:17:14,097
(intense instrumental music)

1347
01:17:20,804 --> 01:17:23,206
Ya girl look like a zombie.

1348
01:17:32,348 --> 01:17:34,951
* Coming home, I'm coming home

1349
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:37,887
* Tell the world that
 I'm coming home *

1350
01:17:37,921 --> 01:17:40,724
* Let the rain wash away

1351
01:17:40,757 --> 01:17:43,693
* All the pain of yesterday

1352
01:17:43,727 --> 01:17:46,362
* I know my kingdom awaits

1353
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:48,998
* And they've
 forgiven my mistakes *

1354
01:17:49,032 --> 01:17:52,068
* I'm coming home,
 I'm coming home *

1355
01:17:52,101 --> 01:17:55,171
* Tell the world
 that I'm coming *

1356
01:17:55,204 --> 01:17:57,140
* Home

1357
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:00,710
You are officially a
 member of Crew Nine.

1358
01:18:00,744 --> 01:18:01,778
(cheering)

1359
01:18:01,811 --> 01:18:04,047
(laughing)

1360
01:18:09,152 --> 01:18:10,319
She did great!

1361
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:13,857
(laughing)

1362
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:18,227
Congratulations Ms. Magavo,

1363
01:18:18,261 --> 01:18:19,963
I hear you did
 exceptionally well.

1364
01:18:19,996 --> 01:18:21,697
I did all right.

1365
01:18:22,398 --> 01:18:23,900
- [Officer] Everyone
 exit the bus,

1366
01:18:23,933 --> 01:18:27,937
line up alongside of
 the bus single file.

1367
01:18:27,971 --> 01:18:29,906
Go, step lively please.

1368
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:41,184
(somber guitar music)

1369
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:43,286
I thought my peoples
 was looking out for me

1370
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:44,788
on the outside.

1371
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:48,491
The only one looking out
for Keisha is Keisha.

1372
01:18:48,524 --> 01:18:52,428
You and Terry always
 looked out for me.

1373
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:55,198
You gotta make the right
decisions for yourself,

1374
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:59,068
can't let other people
make decisions for you.

1375
01:19:05,308 --> 01:19:07,110
No price is too high to pay

1376
01:19:07,143 --> 01:19:10,146
for the privilege
 of owning oneself.

1377
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:22,892
- [Inmate] Come help
 me pick this up?

1378
01:19:22,926 --> 01:19:25,528
He looks just like my dog Lobo.

1379
01:19:25,561 --> 01:19:28,097
He must be so old by now...

1380
01:19:28,131 --> 01:19:30,299
I wish I knew if
 he was still alive.

1381
01:19:30,333 --> 01:19:31,567
You can't find out?

1382
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,469
Well he lives with my dad.

1383
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:36,272
Is he okay living with your dad?

1384
01:19:36,305 --> 01:19:38,541
Yeah, why wouldn't he be?

1385
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:41,577
I don't know...

1386
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:44,513
You don't talk to him,
so I thought you know...

1387
01:19:44,547 --> 01:19:46,149
Maybe he--

1388
01:19:46,182 --> 01:19:48,852
There's something
 wrong with my dad?

1389
01:19:48,885 --> 01:19:51,487
No, there's something
 wrong with me.

1390
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,489
You didn't hurt anybody.

1391
01:19:53,522 --> 01:19:54,557
That's what I thought, you know?

1392
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:56,893
I'm just printing fake checks,

1393
01:19:56,926 --> 01:19:59,028
big corporations would
 never even notice,

1394
01:19:59,062 --> 01:20:01,064
no one would get hurt...

1395
01:20:02,165 --> 01:20:05,201
If you're here,
 you've hurt somebody.

1396
01:20:06,502 --> 01:20:09,572
When they arrested me,
I saw the strongest man

1397
01:20:09,605 --> 01:20:11,507
that I ever knew crumble.

1398
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:16,079
My dad just crumbled.

1399
01:20:18,882 --> 01:20:22,919
So you're never gonna
 talk to him again?

1400
01:20:22,952 --> 01:20:25,488
He raised me right.

1401
01:20:25,521 --> 01:20:27,190
I threw it all away.

1402
01:20:28,291 --> 01:20:30,593
(dog barking)

1403
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:36,332
Yo, what's he barking at?

1404
01:20:48,244 --> 01:20:49,078
Hey buddy.

1405
01:20:57,453 --> 01:20:58,621
Get help, now!

1406
01:21:00,656 --> 01:21:02,992
We're on the upper
 part of Canyon Road,

1407
01:21:03,026 --> 01:21:04,427
the car appears unstable.

1408
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:06,029
We cannot wait!

1409
01:21:06,062 --> 01:21:07,463
Can you do this?

1410
01:21:07,496 --> 01:21:08,297
Yeah.

1411
01:21:08,331 --> 01:21:09,532
All right.

1412
01:21:09,565 --> 01:21:11,600
Do not exceed the limit.

1413
01:21:11,634 --> 01:21:13,602
These ropes only
hold 600 pounds,

1414
01:21:13,636 --> 01:21:16,072
we just want to secure
 the car until help comes.

1415
01:21:16,105 --> 01:21:16,906
Got it?

1416
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:17,640
Yup.

1417
01:21:17,673 --> 01:21:18,641
All right.

1418
01:21:18,674 --> 01:21:19,575
Let's go.

1419
01:21:28,484 --> 01:21:31,020
- [Man] I'm gonna fall.

1420
01:21:31,054 --> 01:21:33,522
Don't move, we're coming down!

1421
01:21:38,194 --> 01:21:40,096
- [Caroline] Give me some slack.

1422
01:21:40,129 --> 01:21:41,530
- [Inmate] Slack!

1423
01:21:48,337 --> 01:21:49,205
Pass me the rope.

1424
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:50,639
Tie it mid point.

1425
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:04,187
We're stabilizing the
 car, are you okay?

1426
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:05,321
Get me out.

1427
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:08,091
I'm gonna fall!

1428
01:22:08,124 --> 01:22:09,625
Okay, don't move.

1429
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:10,693
Don't move.

1430
01:22:10,726 --> 01:22:13,429
Talk to him, calm him down.

1431
01:22:13,462 --> 01:22:14,463
Okay...

1432
01:22:14,497 --> 01:22:17,533
I need you to stop looking
 down right now cause

1433
01:22:17,566 --> 01:22:19,535
I need you to think
 about something else.

1434
01:22:19,568 --> 01:22:21,537
Ah, I'm gonna fall.

1435
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:23,539
No, no, no.

1436
01:22:23,572 --> 01:22:25,074
You're not gonna fall, okay?

1437
01:22:25,108 --> 01:22:26,342
There's gonna be
 an ambulance here

1438
01:22:26,375 --> 01:22:28,411
in a couple minutes, okay?

1439
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:30,613
(yelling)

1440
01:22:30,646 --> 01:22:31,547
- [Man] I'm gonna fall!

1441
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:32,415
- [Captain Kelly] Caroline!

1442
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:33,449
Please don't leave
 me, don't leave me!

1443
01:22:33,482 --> 01:22:34,984
Get off the car!

1444
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:38,554
- [Inmate] Get off!

1445
01:22:38,587 --> 01:22:39,588
Don't leave me!

1446
01:22:39,622 --> 01:22:41,290
- [Inmate] Caroline!

1447
01:22:42,391 --> 01:22:43,426
- [Terry] What are you doing?

1448
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:44,527
- [Inmate] Get off the car!

1449
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:45,461
Caroline!

1450
01:22:45,494 --> 01:22:46,996
He's gonna fall outta the car!

1451
01:22:47,030 --> 01:22:48,497
Get back on line!

1452
01:22:48,531 --> 01:22:49,632
- [Inmate] Terry, get her off!

1453
01:22:49,665 --> 01:22:51,434
I'm not gonna leave you!

1454
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:53,236
- [Terry] Don't move, Caroline!

1455
01:22:53,269 --> 01:22:55,504
- [Inmate] Caroline, get off!

1456
01:22:55,538 --> 01:22:57,006
- [Captain Kelly] Caroline!

1457
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,342
- [Terry] Jump down!

1458
01:22:59,375 --> 01:23:01,110
Grab the rope!

1459
01:23:01,144 --> 01:23:02,378
Pull
 Pull!

1460
01:23:02,411 --> 01:23:03,579
Pull harder!

1461
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:06,215
Pull, Pull!

1462
01:23:08,784 --> 01:23:10,153
Pull the rope!

1463
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:19,362
Grab the line!

1464
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:22,165
Pull!

1465
01:23:23,099 --> 01:23:24,267
Pull the rope!

1466
01:23:38,781 --> 01:23:40,149
You're okay?

1467
01:23:50,193 --> 01:23:51,660
Butterfly, you good?

1468
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,099
They're good!

1469
01:23:56,132 --> 01:23:58,767
(happy screaming)

1470
01:24:07,143 --> 01:24:10,613
(upbeat instrumental music)

1471
01:24:22,725 --> 01:24:27,530
* I want to thank
 You, Heavenly Father *

1472
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:31,500
* For shining your light on me

1473
01:24:31,534 --> 01:24:36,439
* You sent me someone
 who really loves me *

1474
01:24:36,472 --> 01:24:38,374
* And not just my body

1475
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:40,576
Amy, how do you know
 this old school jam?

1476
01:24:40,609 --> 01:24:42,411
My babysitter.

1477
01:24:42,445 --> 01:24:45,148
* He keeps me happy, so
 very happy, he loves me *

1478
01:24:45,181 --> 01:24:48,717
* I don't know how to be

1479
01:24:48,751 --> 01:24:51,254
* It's been a long time

1480
01:24:51,287 --> 01:24:53,622
* Since I had someone
 who loves me *

1481
01:24:53,656 --> 01:24:58,127
* I owe my thanks to Thee

1482
01:24:58,161 --> 01:25:02,331
* I know it could not
 happen without your love *

1483
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:08,237
* Oh, without your love

1484
01:25:08,271 --> 01:25:11,374
Let me find out
 babygirl got lungs.

1485
01:25:19,415 --> 01:25:20,516
I'm here with Dwayne Johnson,

1486
01:25:20,549 --> 01:25:23,386
Senior Counselor for the
Rockwood Butte Detention Center.

1487
01:25:23,419 --> 01:25:25,621
Dwayne, you must be
very proud of Crew Nine.

1488
01:25:25,654 --> 01:25:27,623
Can you tell me a little more
 about the two young ladies

1489
01:25:27,656 --> 01:25:31,160
that orchestrated
 that amazing rescue?

1490
01:25:31,194 --> 01:25:33,496
They're amazing girls,
 I mean they work hard

1491
01:25:33,529 --> 01:25:35,431
and they're trying to
 get back to society

1492
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:37,600
and I couldn't be
 prouder of them.

1493
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:38,434
That's amazing.

1494
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:39,568
Oh, is that them?

1495
01:25:39,602 --> 01:25:40,603
I hear them.

1496
01:25:45,741 --> 01:25:47,876
* And he'll be there

1497
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:50,213
* Just do all right,
 don't do no wrong *

1498
01:25:50,246 --> 01:25:52,348
* And keep the faith

1499
01:25:52,381 --> 01:25:56,552
* The Lord will shine
 his light your way *

1500
01:26:00,689 --> 01:26:01,624
Excuse me.

1501
01:26:04,227 --> 01:26:07,596
* I did cause I believe

1502
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:11,434
* He makes me happy,
 so very happy *

1503
01:26:11,467 --> 01:26:12,535
You girls all right?

1504
01:26:12,568 --> 01:26:14,503
* I don't know how to be

1505
01:26:14,537 --> 01:26:16,372
DJ, DJ, you gotta hear her sing.

1506
01:26:16,405 --> 01:26:17,740
* It's been a long time

1507
01:26:17,773 --> 01:26:20,376
Come on Caroline, it's okay.

1508
01:26:20,409 --> 01:26:21,644
Let me hear it.

1509
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:24,580
* I owe my thanks to Thee

1510
01:26:24,613 --> 01:26:25,681
I can't hear you

1511
01:26:25,714 --> 01:26:29,718
* I know it couldn't have
 happened without You *

1512
01:26:31,454 --> 01:26:34,290
* Oh, without You

1513
01:26:45,968 --> 01:26:46,802
Go DJ!

1514
01:26:50,606 --> 01:26:51,740
Go DJ!

1515
01:26:51,774 --> 01:26:52,608
Oh yeah!

1516
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:54,643
Go DJ!

1517
01:26:54,677 --> 01:26:57,480
(laughing)

1518
01:26:57,513 --> 01:26:59,548
Dwayne, you must be
very proud of Crew Nine.

1519
01:26:59,582 --> 01:27:00,983
Can you tell me a
 little more about

1520
01:27:01,016 --> 01:27:02,585
the two young ladies
 that orchestrated

1521
01:27:02,618 --> 01:27:04,587
that amazing rescue?

1522
01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:05,621
They're amazing girls...

1523
01:27:05,654 --> 01:27:06,722
Yes we are!

1524
01:27:12,895 --> 01:27:13,696
Is that them?

1525
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:14,730
I hear them.

1526
01:27:15,598 --> 01:27:16,999
- [Inmate] Yes we are!

1527
01:27:17,032 --> 01:27:19,502
(laughing)

1528
01:27:23,772 --> 01:27:25,374
DJ, DJ, DJ.

1529
01:27:25,408 --> 01:27:28,411
Ms. Scott, right here please.

1530
01:27:28,444 --> 01:27:30,479
Look DJ, we're on TV!

1531
01:27:30,513 --> 01:27:31,380
- [Inmate] Bring it
 back, play it again,

1532
01:27:31,414 --> 01:27:32,581
you gotta play it again.

1533
01:27:32,615 --> 01:27:33,682
- [Inmate] No, we
 can't play it again...

1534
01:27:33,716 --> 01:27:35,484
Your father's here.

1535
01:27:36,619 --> 01:27:37,820
He is?

1536
01:27:37,853 --> 01:27:38,954
Apparently he saw
 you on the news

1537
01:27:38,987 --> 01:27:40,389
and he drove all the way up here

1538
01:27:40,423 --> 01:27:42,625
just to see if you were okay.

1539
01:27:43,659 --> 01:27:45,594
Amy, see your father.

1540
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:49,565
No, it's not visiting day.

1541
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:52,267
Obviously I made an exception.

1542
01:27:57,873 --> 01:27:59,575
Amy...

1543
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:01,544
Amy, can I talk to you?

1544
01:28:02,645 --> 01:28:04,680
You can tell me to
mind my own business...

1545
01:28:04,713 --> 01:28:05,848
I'm fine.

1546
01:28:05,881 --> 01:28:07,082
- [Caroline] But you're crying.

1547
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:08,717
I'm not crying.

1548
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:11,754
Okay.

1549
01:28:14,723 --> 01:28:16,792
But you know what?

1550
01:28:16,825 --> 01:28:18,661
That boy in the car...

1551
01:28:19,862 --> 01:28:23,399
Do you want to know
 what kept him alive?

1552
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,902
It was thinking about how much

1553
01:28:28,571 --> 01:28:29,938
somebody loved him.

1554
01:28:34,009 --> 01:28:35,844
And if you got that...

1555
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:39,014
And it's real...

1556
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:44,720
Why would you ever push it away?

1557
01:28:48,457 --> 01:28:51,727
Because I'm not his
 little girl anymore.

1558
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:52,761
I'm a thief.

1559
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:03,672
That was what you were.

1560
01:29:07,776 --> 01:29:09,478
But you know what?

1561
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,616
I figure you brought
 yourself back

1562
01:29:13,649 --> 01:29:17,052
with everything that
 you've done in here.

1563
01:29:18,521 --> 01:29:21,457
You found that kid in the car.

1564
01:29:21,490 --> 01:29:22,558
You did that.

1565
01:29:31,734 --> 01:29:32,901
You saved him.

1566
01:29:36,705 --> 01:29:37,540
You did.

1567
01:29:49,852 --> 01:29:50,786
Hi daddy.

1568
01:29:58,961 --> 01:29:59,795
Hey!

1569
01:30:03,999 --> 01:30:05,067
I miss you.

1570
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:08,170
Yeah...

1571
01:30:08,203 --> 01:30:09,672
I miss you too.

1572
01:30:13,709 --> 01:30:14,777
I love you.

1573
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:18,881
I love you too.

1574
01:30:22,217 --> 01:30:23,418
I'm sorry.

1575
01:30:24,787 --> 01:30:25,621
What?

1576
01:30:26,755 --> 01:30:28,557
I'm sorry.

1577
01:30:28,591 --> 01:30:29,424
Oh no...

1578
01:30:30,793 --> 01:30:31,627
It's okay.

1579
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:37,466
Will I see you next week?

1580
01:30:38,601 --> 01:30:40,503
It's a date.

1581
01:30:40,536 --> 01:30:43,506
(chuckling)

1582
01:30:43,539 --> 01:30:44,607
Bye babygirl.

1583
01:30:47,943 --> 01:30:49,778
I'm very proud of you!

1584
01:30:56,018 --> 01:30:59,622
We frighten people
 by the deeds we did.

1585
01:31:02,057 --> 01:31:04,793
We frighten ourselves...

1586
01:31:04,827 --> 01:31:06,862
But sometimes...

1587
01:31:06,895 --> 01:31:10,899
It just takes one
person who got a vision

1588
01:31:10,933 --> 01:31:12,701
of who we could be.

1589
01:31:20,943 --> 01:31:24,446
That woman died on the
 street cause of me.

1590
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:30,285
Now if the point
of me being here

1591
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:31,987
is to be punished...

1592
01:31:33,188 --> 01:31:36,592
Then there's not enough
years in my life to pay

1593
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:39,628
what I took from
 her and her family.

1594
01:31:41,564 --> 01:31:44,733
Then what do you
 think the point is?

1595
01:31:49,938 --> 01:31:53,041
To learn that it's
 not all about me.

1596
01:31:53,075 --> 01:31:54,977
No matter how scared...

1597
01:32:00,649 --> 01:32:01,516
Hurt...

1598
01:32:04,587 --> 01:32:05,721
Misunderstood...

1599
01:32:07,723 --> 01:32:08,757
Alone...

1600
01:32:13,762 --> 01:32:15,297
No matter how I feel,

1601
01:32:16,899 --> 01:32:20,669
I still gotta step up
and do the right thing.

1602
01:32:22,037 --> 01:32:24,607
Even if you deny me today,

1603
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:27,275
and you deny me in six months,

1604
01:32:27,309 --> 01:32:29,678
and you deny me next year.

1605
01:32:31,179 --> 01:32:32,014
Yeah...

1606
01:32:33,716 --> 01:32:37,252
I'm not doing anything
 to impress this board.

1607
01:32:41,189 --> 01:32:42,791
It's just who I am.

1608
01:32:54,369 --> 01:32:55,704
Now you tell your
 aunt she better take

1609
01:32:55,738 --> 01:32:57,172
real good care of you.

1610
01:32:57,205 --> 01:32:58,641
- [Terry] I will.

1611
01:32:58,674 --> 01:32:59,274
- [Officer] We're
 gonna miss you.

1612
01:32:59,307 --> 01:33:00,242
- [Terry] Thank you.

1613
01:33:00,275 --> 01:33:02,044
- [Officer] Just take care.

1614
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:12,087
Not fair...

1615
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:14,289
You've leaving before
 the girls get up.

1616
01:33:14,322 --> 01:33:16,358
You know I'm bad at goodbyes.

1617
01:33:16,391 --> 01:33:18,593
You'll tell them for me?

1618
01:33:24,099 --> 01:33:25,267
Thank you, DJ.

1619
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:27,703
For everything.

1620
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:34,109
Goodbye, Ms. Easle.

1621
01:33:41,083 --> 01:33:44,252
(somber violin music)

1622
01:34:25,393 --> 01:34:26,995
Got me, you got me.

1623
01:34:30,265 --> 01:34:31,066
Good morning.

1624
01:34:31,099 --> 01:34:32,034
Good morning.

1625
01:34:32,067 --> 01:34:33,468
