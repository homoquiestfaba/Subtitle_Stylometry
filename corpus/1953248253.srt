into Decepticon hands.

364
00:20:12,742 --> 00:20:16,811
If anyone would have
backed that play, it's Bulkhead.

365

It's simply too early to know
the extent of his condition.

366
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,952
Something as simple
as a familiar sight or smell,

367
00:20:23,954 --> 00:20:25,787
perhaps even a sound,

368
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:28,857
