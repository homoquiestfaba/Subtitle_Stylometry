1
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,919
Houston, this is Condor.

2
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:08,797
We are doing an E.V.A.
of the payload.

3
00:01:08,838 --> 00:01:12,756
We are about to present
the module with--

4
00:01:12,796 --> 00:01:14,755
What the--

5
00:01:14,795 --> 00:01:18,353
Oh, my gentle Jesus.

6
00:01:18,394 --> 00:01:21,192
Houston...we have a problem.

7
00:01:22,273 --> 00:01:25,111
Launch procedure commence.

8
00:01:43,785 --> 00:01:45,664
Oh, God!

9
00:01:46,903 --> 00:01:49,142
And I’m spent.

10
00:01:50,622 --> 00:01:52,101
Do you smoke after sex?

11
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:54,340
I don't know, baby.
I never looked.

12
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,899
Oh, Austin!

13
00:02:00,418 --> 00:02:02,177
What shall we do now?

14
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:04,617
Well, I’ve got an idea.
Why don’t we shag?

15
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,656
-Again?
-Sure, baby.

16
00:02:06,696 --> 00:02:08,975
We're only up to chapter eleven
in the "Kama Sutra."

17
00:02:09,015 --> 00:02:11,334
Don’t you want to try
the wheelbarrow...

18
00:02:11,374 --> 00:02:12,813
or the praying donkey...

19
00:02:12,854 --> 00:02:14,693
or the Chinese shag swing?

20
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:18,571
I’m going to get us
some more champagne, jungle boy.

21
00:02:18,612 --> 00:02:21,051
I’m going to get us
some more champagne, jungle boy.

22
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:27,168
Are you OK?

23
00:02:27,168 --> 00:02:29,886
I’ve never felt better, Austin.

24
00:02:29,927 --> 00:02:31,926
All right, then.

25
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:35,645
I’m just gonna go watch a movie.

26
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:41,723
"In Like Flint."
That's my favorite movie.

27
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,799
Vanessa.

28
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,359
What's going on?

29
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:56,357
I don't know what you mean,
Austin.

30
00:02:56,398 --> 00:02:57,957
I’m the same Vane--

31
00:02:59,956 --> 00:03:01,675
You must be--

32
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:04,434
Tu imaginacion
esta jugando con ti, querido.

33
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,634
Oh, my God!

34
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:13,071
You're a fembot!

35
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:14,830
No shit, Sherlock!

36
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,909
Machine gun jubblies?

37
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:22,227
How did I miss those, baby?

38
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:25,226
Perhaps next time
you should try foreplay.

39
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:27,306
Right. Oh, my God!

40
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,779
Here's your wedding present,
Mr. Powers.

41
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:49,218
A kamikaze bride from me--

42
00:03:49,258 --> 00:03:51,177
Dr. Evil.

43
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,452
Oh, thank God.

44
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,089
I can't believe Vanessa...

45
00:04:13,089 --> 00:04:15,088
my bride...

46
00:04:15,128 --> 00:04:17,846
my one true love...

47
00:04:17,887 --> 00:04:21,725
the woman who taught me
the beauty of monogamy...

48
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:25,004
was a fembot all along.

49
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:27,803
Wait a tick.

50
00:04:27,844 --> 00:04:29,843
That means I’m single again!

51
00:04:29,883 --> 00:04:31,362
Oh, behave!

52
00:04:32,802 --> 00:04:34,481
Yeah!

53
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:36,680
Yeah, baby, yeah!

54
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,319
Halt!

55
00:04:58,192 --> 00:04:59,791
Yeah, baby, yeah!

56
00:05:21,224 --> 00:05:22,143
Look!

57
00:05:26,422 --> 00:05:27,861
How are you?

58
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:29,300
Good to see you.

59
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:37,617
What's that?

60
00:05:37,658 --> 00:05:39,897
Yes. Yeah, that.
Good one, man.

61
00:05:39,937 --> 00:05:41,336
What's goin' on here?

62
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:42,775
Good to see you guys.

63
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:44,255
Good to see you.

64
00:05:47,254 --> 00:05:48,653
Rabbis, how are you?

65
00:05:48,694 --> 00:05:51,053
Nice meat.

66
00:05:51,573 --> 00:05:52,972
Photo op.

67
00:05:53,012 --> 00:05:54,171
L'chaim!

68
00:06:15,924 --> 00:06:17,323
Yeah, baby.

69
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:16,741
Keep a close eye
on that Kreplachistan situation.

70
00:07:16,781 --> 00:07:18,100
Yes, sir.

71
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:24,218
Jerry! Jerry!

72
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:25,657
Thank you.

73
00:07:25,698 --> 00:07:27,017
Thank you very much.

74
00:07:27,057 --> 00:07:28,936
If you just joined us,
today's topic is...

75
00:07:28,937 --> 00:07:32,055
”My father is evil, and he
wants to take over the world.”

76
00:07:33,255 --> 00:07:36,493
OK, let's meet Scott Evil.

77
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:44,331
Hi, Scott.
Nice to have you with us.

78
00:07:44,371 --> 00:07:46,050
Tell us about your father.

79
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,368
My dad is the head of
a worldwide evil organization...

80
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:52,368
with aspirations
of world domination.

81
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:56,326
Pretty serious stuff.
Where is he now?

82
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:59,084
He's, like,
cryogenically frozen...

83
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,644
orbiting the earth or something.

84
00:08:00,685 --> 00:08:02,004
That's what you think.

85
00:08:02,044 --> 00:08:04,443
We have a surprise for you.

86
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:07,201
Let's bring out
Scott's father Dr. Evil!

87
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,601
What?

88
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,399
General,
we've got a situation here.

89
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:19,837
What is it, Sergeant?

90
00:08:19,878 --> 00:08:21,077
Hello, Scott.

91
00:08:21,117 --> 00:08:23,196
Daddy's back.

92
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:27,194
How could you do this to me,
on national television?

93
00:08:27,235 --> 00:08:29,674
Well, throw me
a frickin' bone here, Scott.

94
00:08:29,714 --> 00:08:31,833
Why'd you run out on me?

95
00:08:32,993 --> 00:08:35,352
Because you're not quite
evil enough.

96
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:38,230
Well, it's true.

97
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:40,910
You're quasi-evil.

98
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,549
You're semi-evil.

99
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,428
You're the margarine of evil.

100
00:08:44,469 --> 00:08:47,627
You're the Diet Coke of evil.

101
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:50,066
Just one calorie.
Not evil enough.

102
00:08:50,107 --> 00:08:51,946
What are you,
some kind of freak?

103
00:08:51,946 --> 00:08:53,985
-Shut up, you--
-OK, come on.

104
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:56,224
I’ll kick your...punk.

105
00:08:56,264 --> 00:08:57,623
Bring it on, skanky--

106
00:08:57,664 --> 00:08:59,183
All right, come on.

107
00:08:59,223 --> 00:09:01,502
No one talks to my son
like that. It's OK, Scott.

108
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:02,821
You mother--

109
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:15,416
You were born in your mother's--

110
00:09:17,216 --> 00:09:19,615
I’m OK. All right.

111
00:09:19,656 --> 00:09:22,215
You were born in your mother's--

112
00:09:22,255 --> 00:09:23,374
I’ll kill you both!

113
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:25,973
There you go!

114
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:27,212
Great!

115
00:09:27,253 --> 00:09:28,692
I got your hood!

116
00:09:29,892 --> 00:09:31,291
Settle down.

117
00:09:31,331 --> 00:09:33,010
It’s OK.

118
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:35,130
It’s only a television show.
Calm down.

119
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,489
I’m all right. I’m easy.

120
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:37,608
-Everything OK?
-OK.

121
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:38,808
Get this jerk out of here.

122
00:09:38,848 --> 00:09:41,726
I’ll give you--piece of--

123
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,525
He's biting me!

124
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:49,284
The...is biting me!

125
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:56,682
The world is mine, you--

126
00:10:08,877 --> 00:10:10,396
You've got mail.

127
00:10:10,437 --> 00:10:11,796
Hello, Basil.

128
00:10:11,836 --> 00:10:13,995
Hello, Austin.
How was your honeymoon?

129
00:10:14,035 --> 00:10:17,193
It turns out
that Vanessa was a fembot.

130
00:10:17,234 --> 00:10:20,432
Yes. We knew all along, sadly.

131
00:10:20,473 --> 00:10:24,311
Anyway, I have
a new assignment for you.

132
00:10:24,352 --> 00:10:26,231
You're scheduled for
a photo shoot...

133
00:10:26,271 --> 00:10:29,069
and one of the models
works for Dr. Evil.

134
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,469
Groovy, baby!

135
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:32,948
Shaguar, ho!

136
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:42,664
Show me to the models, baby.

137
00:10:42,705 --> 00:10:45,024
Let the magic begin.

138
00:10:45,064 --> 00:10:47,263
Who have we got today?

139
00:10:47,303 --> 00:10:48,382
OK, great.

140
00:10:48,423 --> 00:10:50,342
Austin Powers,
I’ve heard a lot about you.

141
00:10:50,382 --> 00:10:51,741
I’m Rebecca Romijn.

142
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:53,220
I don't believe
I’ve had the pleasure.

143
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:55,180
Well, of course
you haven't had...

144
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,099
the pleasure, Rebecca.

145
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,298
We just met, baby. Yeah.

146
00:11:01,858 --> 00:11:04,896
Who are you, baby?

147
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,936
Ivana.

148
00:11:06,976 --> 00:11:09,015
Ivana Humpalot.

149
00:11:09,055 --> 00:11:10,574
Excuse me?

150
00:11:12,414 --> 00:11:14,613
And I vanna toilet
made out of solid gold...

151
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:16,572
but it's just not
in the cards, is it?

152
00:11:18,092 --> 00:11:19,971
You know...

153
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:21,650
OK, everyone, let's get started.

154
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,809
Yes, beautiful. Feeling it!

155
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,569
Let's get some smiles.
It’s all in here.

156
00:11:25,609 --> 00:11:27,168
That's it. Yes!

157
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,727
Let's let the inside out.

158
00:11:28,808 --> 00:11:30,087
OK, you're an animal!

159
00:11:30,127 --> 00:11:31,486
Yes, there we go.

160
00:11:31,487 --> 00:11:32,686
You're a tiger!

161
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:33,925
You're Tony the Tiger!

162
00:11:33,966 --> 00:11:35,565
You're grrreat!

163
00:11:35,605 --> 00:11:37,084
Very good. Loving it.

164
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,484
Now you're a lemur.

165
00:11:38,524 --> 00:11:40,403
Running as a pack.

166
00:11:40,443 --> 00:11:41,842
We go left.

167
00:11:41,883 --> 00:11:43,482
We go right.

168
00:11:43,522 --> 00:11:44,841
There's a predator
out of the jungle.

169
00:11:44,882 --> 00:11:46,201
What's going on?

170
00:11:46,241 --> 00:11:47,600
Burrow!

171
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:49,400
That's right, you’re a lemur.
That's all you've got.

172
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,639
You don't have sharp teeth
capable of biting.

173
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,998
Make an interconnected series
of tunnels like the Viet Cong.

174
00:11:54,038 --> 00:11:55,157
And look.

175
00:11:55,198 --> 00:11:57,197
I’m not even shooting you.
It’s crazy.

176
00:11:57,237 --> 00:11:59,276
And I’m spent.

177
00:11:59,316 --> 00:12:01,075
Right, that’s a wrap, everyone.

178
00:12:01,116 --> 00:12:02,755
Miss Humpalot.

179
00:12:02,795 --> 00:12:04,314
Da, darling?

180
00:12:04,354 --> 00:12:05,673
Shall we?

181
00:12:05,714 --> 00:12:08,153
Give me moment, hmm?

182
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:20,748
Dr. Evil, several years ago...

183
00:12:20,788 --> 00:12:24,026
we invested in a small
Seattle-based coffee company.

184
00:12:25,187 --> 00:12:29,185
Today Starbucks offers
premium quality coffee...

185
00:12:29,225 --> 00:12:31,184
at affordable prices.

186
00:12:31,225 --> 00:12:33,384
De-lish!

187
00:12:36,143 --> 00:12:38,022
If we shift our resources...

188
00:12:38,062 --> 00:12:42,060
away from evil empires
and towards Starbucks...

189
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,580
we can increase
our profits five-fold.

190
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,578
Number Two,
I make the decisions here, OK?

191
00:12:48,618 --> 00:12:50,297
I demand a little respect.

192
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:53,335
Dr. Evil,
you have a little of the...

193
00:12:53,376 --> 00:12:55,255
Silence!

194
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:58,494
I will not tolerate
your insolence!

195
00:12:58,534 --> 00:13:01,412
Frau Farbissina,
wie geht es ihnen?

196
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:03,332
Sehr gut, Herr Doktor.

197
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,732
How are things?

198
00:13:04,772 --> 00:13:08,570
I have come to embrace the love
that dare not speak its name.

199
00:13:08,611 --> 00:13:10,290
To my right is my lover.

200
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,449
We met at the LPGA Tour.

201
00:13:12,489 --> 00:13:15,008
Her name is Unibrau.

202
00:13:16,248 --> 00:13:17,407
Right on.

203
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:20,606
Welcome, Unibrau.

204
00:13:23,925 --> 00:13:25,004
What?

205
00:13:25,045 --> 00:13:27,763
A little milk...nose...mustache.

206
00:13:29,363 --> 00:13:31,842
I know.

207
00:13:31,882 --> 00:13:33,041
Meant to.

208
00:13:33,082 --> 00:13:35,521
That's how we drink it
in Belgium.

209
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:37,000
Called a Belgian dip.

210
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,319
While you were frozen...

211
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:43,237
we began a program to clone you.

212
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:44,717
Cool.

213
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,036
Send in the clone!

214
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,594
He is exactly like you
in every way.

215
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:56,712
Except one eighth your size.

216
00:13:57,752 --> 00:13:59,431
Breathtaking.

217
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:02,390
I shall call him...

218
00:14:02,431 --> 00:14:04,270
Mini-Me.

219
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,867
Your stock is rising,
Number Two.

220
00:14:14,026 --> 00:14:15,585
Come, Mr. Bigglesworth.

221
00:14:17,945 --> 00:14:20,304
Mini-Me, are you hungry?

222
00:14:20,344 --> 00:14:21,863
Something to eat?

223
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,022
Not even a Hot Pocket?

224
00:14:24,423 --> 00:14:25,782
An Eggo?

225
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:29,220
No,we don't gnaw on our kitty.

226
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:32,699
Leave Mini-Mr. Bigglesworth
alone.

227
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,778
Just love him and stroke him.

228
00:14:36,578 --> 00:14:38,017
As you know...

229
00:14:38,018 --> 00:14:40,856
every diabolical scheme
that I have hatched...

230
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:43,654
has been thwarted
by Austin Powers.

231
00:14:43,695 --> 00:14:45,654
And why is that,
ladies and gentlemen?

232
00:14:45,695 --> 00:14:47,534
'Cause you never kill him
when you get the chance to...

233
00:14:47,574 --> 00:14:48,973
and you're a big dope.

234
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:58,250
Down, Mini-Me.

235
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:03,768
Austin Powers always defeats me
because he has mojo.

236
00:15:03,808 --> 00:15:05,167
Mojo?

237
00:15:06,687 --> 00:15:08,926
The libido. The life force.

238
00:15:08,966 --> 00:15:11,045
The essence. The right stuff.

239
00:15:11,045 --> 00:15:13,564
What the French call
a certain...

240
00:15:13,604 --> 00:15:15,603
I don't know what.

241
00:15:15,644 --> 00:15:17,603
Ladies and gentlemen...

242
00:15:17,643 --> 00:15:20,082
I’ve developed a device
for traveling through time...

243
00:15:20,162 --> 00:15:23,360
which I call a “time machine.”

244
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:26,359
Using this “time machine...”

245
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,638
I’m going back to the Sixties
and steal Austin Powers' mojo.

246
00:15:30,678 --> 00:15:32,557
If you have a time machine...

247
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:34,476
why not just go back
and kill Austin Powers...

248
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,116
when he's sitting
on the crapper or something?

249
00:15:36,156 --> 00:15:39,234
How about no, Scott?

250
00:15:39,275 --> 00:15:40,394
OK?

251
00:15:40,434 --> 00:15:43,832
Why not use your knowledge
of the future...

252
00:15:43,873 --> 00:15:45,392
to play the stock market?

253
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:46,872
We could make trillions.

254
00:15:46,872 --> 00:15:50,830
Why make trillions
when we could make...

255
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,549
billions?

256
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:56,588
A trillion is more
than a billion, numnuts.

257
00:15:56,628 --> 00:15:58,347
All right, zip it.

258
00:15:58,388 --> 00:16:00,187
-You can't even--
-Zip it.

259
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:01,706
Zi-i-i-p.

260
00:16:01,746 --> 00:16:02,985
Look, all I’m--

261
00:16:03,026 --> 00:16:04,745
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, ex-zip-it “A.”

262
00:16:04,785 --> 00:16:06,384
Number Two,
would you please back me up?

263
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:09,223
-Look, I’m Zippi Longstocking.
-l can't--

264
00:16:09,264 --> 00:16:10,823
When a problem comes along

265
00:16:10,863 --> 00:16:12,382
You must zip it

266
00:16:12,422 --> 00:16:13,821
Zip it good.

267
00:16:13,862 --> 00:16:15,301
Frau, would you please--

268
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,259
Subtitle: “Zip it.”

269
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,499
-I’m just trying to--
-Zip.

270
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:23,938
Would you like to have
a suckle of my zipple?

271
00:16:23,978 --> 00:16:25,897
-l want you--Stop--
-Zip.

272
00:16:26,857 --> 00:16:29,416
Listen--All--You know--

273
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:31,175
You're like a child--

274
00:16:31,216 --> 00:16:34,294
Talk in--If you--
Just--One time--

275
00:16:34,334 --> 00:16:37,013
Zip it.
Unveil the time portal.

276
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,129
As you know...

277
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:52,887
Austin Powers
was frozen in 1967.

278
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,965
Therefore,
I will travel to 1969...

279
00:16:56,006 --> 00:16:58,565
two years after he was frozen.

280
00:16:58,605 --> 00:17:00,044
He'll be helpless.

281
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,444
Ladies and gentlemen...

282
00:17:01,484 --> 00:17:02,803
I’m about to travel
through time.

283
00:17:02,844 --> 00:17:04,443
I bid you adieu.

284
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,640
I’m OK.

285
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:16,598
Not turned on, I suppose.

286
00:17:17,518 --> 00:17:19,957
Do you think you could...

287
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,196
Yeah, thanks.

288
00:17:21,197 --> 00:17:23,196
Come, Mini-Me!

289
00:17:27,075 --> 00:17:29,394
Don't be scared, Mini-Me.

290
00:17:41,949 --> 00:17:44,228
Welcome to 1969.

291
00:17:44,268 --> 00:17:46,627
Thank you, Number Two.

292
00:17:46,628 --> 00:17:49,187
You look so healthy
and youthful.

293
00:17:49,227 --> 00:17:50,466
Well, thank you.

294
00:17:50,506 --> 00:17:51,625
Herr Doktor.

295
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,984
And Frau, you look so...

296
00:17:57,903 --> 00:18:00,661
Right.

297
00:18:00,702 --> 00:18:03,500
I received your memo
from the future.

298
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,620
Your new lair is up and running.

299
00:18:05,661 --> 00:18:08,419
Is it a hollowed-out volcano
like I asked for?

300
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:10,458
Of course.

301
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:13,417
Good.

302
00:18:13,418 --> 00:18:16,816
Then it's all going
perfectly to plan.

303
00:18:43,447 --> 00:18:45,846
Yeah, baby, yeah!

304
00:18:50,284 --> 00:18:52,923
When did you get the Clapper?

305
00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:54,962
November 1964.

306
00:18:55,002 --> 00:18:57,001
Dutch East Indies. Shore leave.

307
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,919
Do you know how we keep warm
in Russia?

308
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,039
I can guess, baby.

309
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,238
We play chess.

310
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:06,358
I guessed wrong.

311
00:19:06,398 --> 00:19:10,596
It takes a keen intellect
to play chess.

312
00:19:10,636 --> 00:19:13,634
I assume you know how to play.

313
00:19:16,594 --> 00:19:17,833
Of course, baby.

314
00:19:37,307 --> 00:19:40,025
What to do, what to do.

315
00:20:09,135 --> 00:20:11,574
Let me ask you a question.

316
00:20:11,614 --> 00:20:13,533
And be honest.

317
00:20:13,573 --> 00:20:15,772
Do I make you horny, baby?

318
00:20:15,812 --> 00:20:17,491
Do l?

319
00:20:17,532 --> 00:20:20,011
Do I make you randy?

320
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,969
No more games.

321
00:20:25,009 --> 00:20:27,368
Dr. Evil sent me here
to kill you...

322
00:20:27,408 --> 00:20:29,927
but I find you so...

323
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,766
sexy and...

324
00:20:33,246 --> 00:20:35,605
Just make love to me.

325
00:20:35,605 --> 00:20:37,564
Now, Austin Powerovich.

326
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:39,083
Hurry!

327
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:45,800
You're hairy like animal!

328
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:48,639
Grr, baby! Very grr!

329
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,159
Make love to me, monkey man.

330
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:54,678
Dr. Evil, I don't understand...

331
00:20:54,718 --> 00:20:57,676
how we can hope to steal
Austin Powers' mojo.

332
00:20:57,717 --> 00:20:59,316
We've tried this before.

333
00:21:00,596 --> 00:21:03,075
The security around Powers
is foolproof.

334
00:21:03,115 --> 00:21:05,274
But this time
we have an operative...

335
00:21:05,314 --> 00:21:07,673
inside the Ministry of Defense.

336
00:21:07,713 --> 00:21:08,872
Really?

337
00:21:08,913 --> 00:21:11,112
Yes, really.

338
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:16,949
He's stealing Austin Powers'
mojo even as we speak.

339
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,229
Really?

340
00:21:23,187 --> 00:21:25,066
He's a disgruntled
Scottish guard...

341
00:21:25,107 --> 00:21:28,385
known for his lethal temper
and his unusual eating habits.

342
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:30,224
He weighs a metric ton.

343
00:21:30,265 --> 00:21:33,143
His name...Fat Bastard.

344
00:21:35,623 --> 00:21:39,541
We've had reports there's a spy
in the Ministry of Defense.

345
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:42,260
The contents of this room
are vital to the country.

346
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,699
Be on special alert.

347
00:21:44,739 --> 00:21:46,018
Yes, sir.

348
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:49,937
And try to lose some weight,
for God's sake.

349
00:21:54,336 --> 00:21:57,454
Mr. English colonel
tellin' me to lose weight.

350
00:21:57,495 --> 00:22:00,733
I’m a hard case, he says.

351
00:22:00,773 --> 00:22:02,612
Well, listen up, sonny Jim...

352
00:22:02,653 --> 00:22:05,571
I ate a baby!

353
00:22:05,612 --> 00:22:09,530
Oh, aye, baby.
The other other white meat.

354
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,848
Baby: It’s what's for dinner.

355
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,558
I’ve got your mojo now,
sonny Jim.

356
00:22:41,758 --> 00:22:43,477
What's wrong?

357
00:22:43,517 --> 00:22:45,236
Crikey!

358
00:22:45,277 --> 00:22:47,716
I’ve lost my mojo.

359
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:53,713
Austin,
the test results confirm...

360
00:22:53,754 --> 00:22:55,633
that you've lost your mojo...

361
00:22:55,673 --> 00:22:57,992
and it couldn't come
at a worse time.

362
00:22:58,032 --> 00:23:01,950
We have evidence that Dr. Evil
has developed a time machine...

363
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:04,909
and has traveled back
to the year 1969.

364
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,109
Luckily, we, too...

365
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:07,988
have developed
a time travel device...

366
00:23:08,028 --> 00:23:10,507
to transport you
back to the Sixties.

367
00:23:11,587 --> 00:23:15,785
This is where you
input your destination.

368
00:23:15,786 --> 00:23:17,145
Wait a tick.

369
00:23:17,185 --> 00:23:21,063
Basil, if I travel back to 1969
and I was frozen in 1967...

370
00:23:21,104 --> 00:23:23,463
presumably, I could go visit
my frozen self.

371
00:23:23,463 --> 00:23:25,862
But if I’m still frozen
in 1967...

372
00:23:25,902 --> 00:23:27,301
how could I have been
unthawed...

373
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:28,740
in the Nineties
and traveled back--

374
00:23:28,781 --> 00:23:30,980
Oh, no, I’ve gone cross-eyed.

375
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,339
I suggest you don't worry
about this sort of thing...

376
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:34,898
and just enjoy yourself.

377
00:23:34,938 --> 00:23:37,097
That goes for you all, too.

378
00:23:38,937 --> 00:23:40,216
This is smashing, Basil.

379
00:23:40,256 --> 00:23:43,534
I go back to the Sixties,
recharge my mojo...

380
00:23:43,575 --> 00:23:46,733
defeat Dr. Evil,
and be back in time for tea.

381
00:23:46,774 --> 00:23:50,052
Swinging Sixties,
here I come, baby, yeah!

382
00:23:50,093 --> 00:23:51,612
Move! Move!

383
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,129
Sorry.

384
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,529
I bet that's expensive.

385
00:24:04,288 --> 00:24:05,407
Sorry.

386
00:24:05,447 --> 00:24:07,246
Easy!

387
00:24:07,286 --> 00:24:08,645
Stop it now, Austin!

388
00:24:08,686 --> 00:24:11,404
Here we go.

389
00:24:11,445 --> 00:24:13,804
Yeah, baby, yeah!

390
00:24:14,964 --> 00:24:17,123
Godspeed, Austin Powers.

391
00:24:34,996 --> 00:24:37,115
I’m home!

392
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:54,348
I’m back in the Sixties,
baby, yeah!

393
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:17,779
Get your hands
off my Heinie, baby.

394
00:25:36,773 --> 00:25:38,292
Who are you today, baby?

395
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:41,771
My name is Robin Swallows.

396
00:25:41,811 --> 00:25:44,529
Swallows.
That's an interesting name.

397
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:47,089
Maiden name's Spitz.

398
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,808
Which is it, baby,
Spitz or Swallows?

399
00:26:36,431 --> 00:26:38,070
Those are skintight.

400
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,549
How do you get
into those pants, baby?

401
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,749
You can start
by buying me a drink.

402
00:26:53,425 --> 00:26:55,704
I want! I want!

403
00:27:13,497 --> 00:27:16,895
Better play it cool.
Your friend works for Dr. Evil.

404
00:27:16,936 --> 00:27:20,974
And just who
do you work for, baby?

405
00:27:23,574 --> 00:27:25,933
Tell me, Mr. Powers...

406
00:27:25,973 --> 00:27:27,572
do you swing?

407
00:27:27,572 --> 00:27:29,051
Are you kidding, baby?

408
00:27:29,132 --> 00:27:31,970
I put the “Grr!” in “swinger,”
baby!

409
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,929
Then why don't you come right...

410
00:27:35,969 --> 00:27:38,927
over here.

411
00:27:38,968 --> 00:27:40,607
I can do that.

412
00:27:53,802 --> 00:27:56,241
Prepare to die, Powers!

413
00:27:57,881 --> 00:28:00,040
Use the machine gun!

414
00:28:08,597 --> 00:28:11,116
Say good-bye, Powers!

415
00:28:12,755 --> 00:28:15,473
Use the bazooka!

416
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,708
The fall will kill us both,
Powers!

417
00:28:38,946 --> 00:28:41,784
You can't win, Powers.

418
00:28:43,784 --> 00:28:46,143
Why won't you die?

419
00:28:51,141 --> 00:28:52,460
Care for a ride?

420
00:28:56,219 --> 00:28:58,578
Go!

421
00:29:03,497 --> 00:29:05,896
Austin Powers, I presume.

422
00:29:05,976 --> 00:29:09,454
Powers by name,
Powers by reputation.

423
00:29:10,654 --> 00:29:12,293
Felicity Shagwell, CIA.

424
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,772
Shagwell by name...

425
00:29:13,813 --> 00:29:16,611
shag-very-well by reputation.

426
00:29:16,652 --> 00:29:19,251
Oh, behave!

427
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:20,730
Not if I can help it.

428
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:36,004
You know what's remarkable
is how much England...

429
00:29:36,045 --> 00:29:39,443
looks in no way
like Southern California.

430
00:29:55,517 --> 00:29:56,676
Crikey!

431
00:29:56,717 --> 00:29:59,595
We've got company! Looks like
one of Dr. Evil's assassins.

432
00:30:21,068 --> 00:30:22,987
Steady now.

433
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,346
Hands up!

434
00:30:24,387 --> 00:30:28,665
Do you remember me,
Austin Powers?

435
00:30:28,705 --> 00:30:31,583
I don't recall your name
but your...

436
00:30:31,624 --> 00:30:34,063
fez is familiar.

437
00:30:37,822 --> 00:30:40,421
My name is Mustafa.

438
00:30:40,461 --> 00:30:43,259
And I’m the man
who will be killing you now.

439
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:47,538
Daktari!

440
00:30:55,815 --> 00:30:57,174
Who sent you?

441
00:30:57,214 --> 00:30:58,413
You'll have to kill me.

442
00:30:58,454 --> 00:30:59,853
Who sent you?

443
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:01,732
Kiss my ass, Powers.

444
00:31:01,733 --> 00:31:03,132
Who sent you?

445
00:31:03,172 --> 00:31:04,491
Dr. Evil.

446
00:31:06,411 --> 00:31:08,770
-That was easy.
-That was.

447
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,489
Why did you tell us?

448
00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:12,648
I can't stand to be asked
the same question three times.

449
00:31:12,689 --> 00:31:14,048
It just irritates me.

450
00:31:14,088 --> 00:31:16,447
Where is Dr. Evil hiding?

451
00:31:16,487 --> 00:31:17,646
Why would he tell me?

452
00:31:17,647 --> 00:31:19,406
I’m just one of his
low-level functionaries.

453
00:31:19,446 --> 00:31:21,205
Where is Dr. Evil hiding?

454
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:23,165
You'll have to torture me.
I’ll never tell you.

455
00:31:23,205 --> 00:31:26,083
-Where is Dr. Evil hiding?
-Damn! Three times.

456
00:31:26,124 --> 00:31:29,682
He's hiding
in the secret volcano lair.

457
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:32,800
Where's Dr. Evil's
secret volcano lair?

458
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:35,280
I spit at the question.

459
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,198
Do I really have to ask you
two more times?

460
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:39,758
Go to hell, Powers!

461
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:46,676
Fine. Where is Dr. Evil's
secret volcano lair?

462
00:31:46,716 --> 00:31:49,594
I will take it
to the grave with me.

463
00:31:49,635 --> 00:31:51,594
You have to answer.
He asked you three times.

464
00:31:53,594 --> 00:31:55,153
The second question was...

465
00:31:55,193 --> 00:31:57,432
”Do I really have to ask you
two more times?”

466
00:31:57,472 --> 00:32:00,790
That would be the first question
in a new line of questioning...

467
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:03,230
and wouldn't count in
the other line of questioning.

468
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,629
He's right.

469
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:06,628
However, I’m just trying to
get information from you, man.

470
00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:10,147
I don't need any consistency
in the questions, do l?

471
00:32:10,187 --> 00:32:12,226
No. You're preaching
to the converted--

472
00:32:13,186 --> 00:32:14,665
If I’m preaching
to the converted...

473
00:32:14,706 --> 00:32:16,025
then why are you
being so slavish...

474
00:32:16,025 --> 00:32:18,104
to the three-question form?

475
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,583
You're not even
looking at me, man.

476
00:32:19,624 --> 00:32:21,223
Now you're just being rude,
you know what I mean?

477
00:32:21,263 --> 00:32:22,502
You're not listening, man.

478
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:29,260
Oh, crikey!

479
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:35,897
Well, Austin, I think this time
you have finally met your match.

480
00:32:35,938 --> 00:32:37,337
Oh, no, baby.

481
00:32:37,377 --> 00:32:40,815
I’ve beaten Dr. Evil before,
and I’ll beat him again.

482
00:32:40,856 --> 00:32:42,855
I was talking about me.

483
00:32:50,372 --> 00:32:51,811
Hello up there!

484
00:32:51,852 --> 00:32:53,971
I seem to have fallen
down a cliff.

485
00:32:54,011 --> 00:32:56,690
I’m still alive,
but I’m very badly injured.

486
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:00,088
I think my legs are broken.
I’ll try to stand.

487
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:02,608
Yes, they are broken.

488
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,527
Perhaps you could
toss me a band-aid...

489
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:06,446
or some antibacterial cream.

490
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:10,284
I’m in an extraordinarily
large amount of pain.

491
00:33:10,325 --> 00:33:12,364
The bone has
gone through the skin.

492
00:33:12,404 --> 00:33:14,483
I fear it might be gangrenous.

493
00:33:14,524 --> 00:33:17,003
The wound is beginning to smell
a little like almonds...

494
00:33:17,043 --> 00:33:18,922
which is not good.

495
00:33:18,962 --> 00:33:20,521
Please?

496
00:33:20,561 --> 00:33:21,640
No one?

497
00:33:21,681 --> 00:33:22,760
Sorry.

498
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,239
I’ll try the other leg.

499
00:33:29,198 --> 00:33:31,437
Two of my assassins are dead.

500
00:33:31,477 --> 00:33:34,235
I will not tolerate failure.

501
00:33:34,276 --> 00:33:36,115
I’m the man who will
maintain the dignity...

502
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:38,035
of this evil organization.

503
00:33:38,035 --> 00:33:40,354
What the hell was that?

504
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:42,793
Volcanic eruption!

505
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:55,748
May I present to you my spy
in the Ministry of Defense...

506
00:33:55,788 --> 00:33:58,906
Fat Bastard.

507
00:33:58,907 --> 00:34:00,626
First things first!

508
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:02,545
Where's your shitter?

509
00:34:02,586 --> 00:34:05,584
I’ve got a turtle head
poking out.

510
00:34:06,984 --> 00:34:08,423
Charming.

511
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:10,263
I’m not kidding.

512
00:34:10,263 --> 00:34:13,781
I got a crap on deck
that could choke a donkey.

513
00:34:13,822 --> 00:34:16,660
It’s squidgey!

514
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:21,338
Christ, I’m getting
all emotional from it, you know?

515
00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:23,738
Right.

516
00:34:23,778 --> 00:34:27,496
Fat Bastard,
could I have my mojo, please?

517
00:34:27,536 --> 00:34:29,415
Where's my money?

518
00:34:29,456 --> 00:34:31,695
All right, give him his money.

519
00:34:33,894 --> 00:34:37,212
Jesus Christ, he's tiny!

520
00:34:37,253 --> 00:34:41,091
I’ve had bigger chunks of corn
in my crap.

521
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:44,570
Wait a minute.

522
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:47,568
He kinda looks like a baby.

523
00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:50,527
Come here! I’m gonna eat you!

524
00:34:50,568 --> 00:34:51,927
I’m bigger than you.

525
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:53,606
I’m higher on the food chain.

526
00:34:53,647 --> 00:34:55,766
Get in my belly!

527
00:34:55,806 --> 00:34:58,365
Come on!

528
00:34:58,405 --> 00:35:00,644
You're lucky, wee man!

529
00:35:01,604 --> 00:35:03,523
Can I have a hug?

530
00:35:06,082 --> 00:35:09,000
Let me make you a deal,
all right?

531
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:11,440
You get the mojo,
you keep your money...

532
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,679
and I’ll get your baby.

533
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,717
Right.

534
00:35:18,757 --> 00:35:20,156
I want my baby back, baby back

535
00:35:20,197 --> 00:35:21,956
Baby back, baby back,
baby back ribs

536
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:23,595
I want my baby back, baby back

537
00:35:23,636 --> 00:35:25,955
Baby back, baby back,
baby back ribs

538
00:35:25,995 --> 00:35:27,474
Excuse me.

539
00:35:27,514 --> 00:35:29,353
Chili

540
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:31,353
Baby back ribs

541
00:35:31,353 --> 00:35:34,711
Dr. Evil, what are we
going to do about Powers?

542
00:35:34,752 --> 00:35:38,230
Austin Powers
is no longer a threat to me.

543
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,549
I have his mojo.

544
00:36:15,976 --> 00:36:19,614
All right, everyone,
you're dismissed.

545
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:21,494
Private time.

546
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:55,801
Dr. Evil, I don't want this
to interfere with our work.

547
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:57,520
Don't worry, mama.

548
00:36:57,561 --> 00:37:00,439
Things won't get weird.

549
00:37:08,397 --> 00:37:09,916
One for me...

550
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,234
and one for my homies.

551
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:17,873
Herr Doktor.

552
00:37:47,422 --> 00:37:49,381
So what happened here?

553
00:37:49,462 --> 00:37:51,341
Apparently a rogue agent
named Fat Bastard...

554
00:37:51,381 --> 00:37:52,780
infiltrated the unit...

555
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,579
assigned to guard
your cryogenic chamber.

556
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,979
He used some sort of nerve gas.

557
00:37:56,019 --> 00:37:57,498
These men don't
remember a thing.

558
00:37:57,539 --> 00:37:58,978
Captain, why don't you...

559
00:37:59,018 --> 00:38:00,577
cross-check
Fat Bastard's profile...

560
00:38:00,617 --> 00:38:02,656
with the mainframe at Langley?

561
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:03,776
Yes, ma'am.

562
00:38:03,816 --> 00:38:05,655
Can I borrow that, please?
Thank you.

563
00:38:07,335 --> 00:38:10,533
Look at me.
I’m a sexy bitch, baby. Yeah!

564
00:38:10,574 --> 00:38:12,173
You're a Popsicle, yes.

565
00:38:14,332 --> 00:38:16,611
And I’m spent.

566
00:38:16,651 --> 00:38:18,970
Let's go, baby, yeah!

567
00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:24,688
Hey there. How are you?

568
00:38:36,964 --> 00:38:38,203
Come on, Felicity.

569
00:39:07,593 --> 00:39:09,032
Yeah, babe.

570
00:39:10,951 --> 00:39:12,350
Shall we sit down?

571
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,749
This is great.

572
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,029
Groovy!

573
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:20,987
So, Austin,
what's the future like?

574
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:23,866
Well,
everyone has a flying car...

575
00:39:23,907 --> 00:39:26,186
entire meals
come in pill form...

576
00:39:26,226 --> 00:39:30,144
and the Earth is ruled
by damned dirty apes!

577
00:39:30,184 --> 00:39:31,663
Oh, my God!

578
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:33,543
Had you for a second.

579
00:39:34,783 --> 00:39:37,262
You can have me for even longer,
if you want.

580
00:39:37,302 --> 00:39:42,060
You're one groovy baby...

581
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,659
baby.

582
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:46,698
Too many “babies.”

583
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:50,577
Don’t you dare move.

584
00:39:52,936 --> 00:39:55,455
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Burt Bacharach...

585
00:39:55,495 --> 00:39:58,213
and Mr. Elvis Costello.

586
00:40:02,092 --> 00:40:05,530
What do you get
when you fall in love?

587
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:08,409
A guy with a pin
to burst your bubble

588
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,729
Would you care to dance?

589
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,209
I'd love to.

590
00:40:11,249 --> 00:40:13,128
For all your trouble

591
00:40:13,168 --> 00:40:15,047
I’ll

592
00:40:15,088 --> 00:40:20,845
Never fall in love again

593
00:40:20,845 --> 00:40:25,603
I’ll never fall in love again

594
00:40:25,644 --> 00:40:30,202
Don't tell me
what it's all about

595
00:40:30,242 --> 00:40:34,080
'Cause I’ve been there
and I’m glad I’m out

596
00:40:34,121 --> 00:40:37,999
Out of the those chains,
those chains that bind you

597
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,877
That is why
I’m here to remind you

598
00:40:41,918 --> 00:40:44,836
What do you get
when you fall in love?

599
00:40:44,877 --> 00:40:49,075
You only get lies
and pain and sorrow

600
00:40:49,115 --> 00:40:52,673
So for at least until tomorrow

601
00:40:52,714 --> 00:40:54,753
I’ll

602
00:40:54,793 --> 00:40:59,271
Never fall in love again

603
00:40:59,311 --> 00:41:01,430
I’ll

604
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:04,388
Never fall in love

605
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:05,628
Again

606
00:41:05,669 --> 00:41:08,108
You're quite good on your feet.

607
00:41:08,148 --> 00:41:10,747
I’m even better off my feet.

608
00:41:23,102 --> 00:41:25,261
Oh, behave, baby.

609
00:41:31,819 --> 00:41:33,698
-Hi.
-Hi there.

610
00:41:35,698 --> 00:41:36,897
How are things?

611
00:41:36,937 --> 00:41:38,736
Good, Herr Doktor. And you?

612
00:41:38,777 --> 00:41:41,456
Great.

613
00:41:41,496 --> 00:41:44,254
Just taking a break?

614
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:47,612
Try the Hot Pockets.
They're breathtaking.

615
00:41:50,492 --> 00:41:51,931
It got weird, didn't it?

616
00:41:51,972 --> 00:41:54,850
-Ja.
-l knew it.

617
00:41:54,891 --> 00:41:56,450
You haven't called.

618
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:57,769
We talked about this.

619
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:00,767
We promised each other
it wouldn't get weird.

620
00:42:00,808 --> 00:42:02,447
I can't let my feelings
for you interfere...

621
00:42:02,488 --> 00:42:05,566
with my taking over the world,
you know that.

622
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:08,845
You know,
I will never love another man.

623
00:42:10,605 --> 00:42:12,124
Yes, that's true.

624
00:42:15,483 --> 00:42:17,922
Dr. Evil, I’m late.

625
00:42:17,962 --> 00:42:19,401
No, you got here right on time.

626
00:42:19,401 --> 00:42:24,639
No, I mean “I’m late.”

627
00:42:30,597 --> 00:42:31,796
Dad.

628
00:42:34,436 --> 00:42:36,955
Hey there, sport.

629
00:42:36,995 --> 00:42:38,314
What are you doing here?

630
00:42:38,354 --> 00:42:42,152
I was just thinking that maybe
we could work all this out.

631
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:44,911
After all, you are my father.

632
00:42:44,952 --> 00:42:48,910
Scott, you had your chance, OK?

633
00:42:48,911 --> 00:42:51,510
I already had someone
created in my image.

634
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,629
He's evil, he wants
to take over the world...

635
00:42:53,629 --> 00:42:56,947
and he fits easily
into most overhead storage bins.

636
00:42:57,028 --> 00:42:58,667
Him?

637
00:42:58,707 --> 00:43:00,066
Look at him, he's crazy.

638
00:43:00,106 --> 00:43:03,424
He's like a vicious
little Chihuahua thing.

639
00:43:04,825 --> 00:43:06,904
He'll kill me
the first chance he gets.

640
00:43:06,944 --> 00:43:08,303
Probably.

641
00:43:09,463 --> 00:43:10,662
I love you.

642
00:43:20,219 --> 00:43:23,897
I am a sexy bitch. Yes.

643
00:43:23,938 --> 00:43:27,496
Felicity,
make yourself at home, baby.

644
00:43:27,536 --> 00:43:29,615
What do you think of
my shag pad, darling?

645
00:43:29,655 --> 00:43:32,294
It’s amazing, Austin.

646
00:43:35,853 --> 00:43:37,732
Wait a tick.

647
00:43:42,891 --> 00:43:47,449
That's how my mojo was stolen.
Fat Bastard.

648
00:43:47,489 --> 00:43:49,728
She's a professional agent.

649
00:43:49,768 --> 00:43:52,726
She's not interested
in shagging!

650
00:43:52,767 --> 00:43:54,046
Please, God.

651
00:43:54,086 --> 00:43:56,045
Spectacles, testicles,
wallet, and watch.

652
00:43:56,086 --> 00:43:58,685
Austin, I’m waiting.

653
00:44:04,602 --> 00:44:07,960
How about one of
your world-famous massages?

654
00:44:08,041 --> 00:44:12,279
You mean a sensual massage?

655
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,719
Right, then.

656
00:44:14,759 --> 00:44:18,357
OK, here we go. Yes.

657
00:44:23,755 --> 00:44:26,673
Wait a minute,
something's itching me.

658
00:44:27,714 --> 00:44:29,193
That's better.

659
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:30,632
Crikey.

660
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:40,549
How does that feel, baby?

661
00:44:40,589 --> 00:44:42,308
Lower.

662
00:44:42,348 --> 00:44:45,306
How does that feel, baby?

663
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:47,186
What?

664
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:48,866
You don't have to be cute
with me.

665
00:44:48,906 --> 00:44:50,345
We're way past that.

666
00:44:50,385 --> 00:44:52,184
We are?

667
00:44:52,225 --> 00:44:54,864
What do you think?

668
00:44:54,904 --> 00:44:58,422
Listen, Felicity...

669
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:00,301
I’m sorry.

670
00:45:00,342 --> 00:45:02,741
I can't do this.

671
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,459
I have to go.

672
00:45:09,418 --> 00:45:10,577
Is it me?

673
00:45:10,618 --> 00:45:14,656
I can't explain.

674
00:45:25,413 --> 00:45:26,532
Hello, Agent Shagwell.

675
00:45:26,572 --> 00:45:28,131
Where's Austin?

676
00:45:28,171 --> 00:45:31,169
I must've said something wrong,
so he just left all of a sudden.

677
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:35,968
Listen, I don't want you
getting too close to Austin.

678
00:45:36,009 --> 00:45:38,328
It’s not meant to be.

679
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,047
I don't get too close
to anybody, Basil.

680
00:45:40,087 --> 00:45:42,046
My interest in this case
is purely professional.

681
00:45:42,086 --> 00:45:43,525
Good.

682
00:45:43,566 --> 00:45:46,324
Then you won't mind tracking
down Fat Bastard tonight.

683
00:45:46,365 --> 00:45:47,484
No problem.

684
00:45:47,524 --> 00:45:49,923
We need you to plant
this homing device on him...

685
00:45:49,963 --> 00:45:51,962
by any means necessary.

686
00:45:52,003 --> 00:45:53,242
No problem.

687
00:45:53,282 --> 00:45:55,241
Keep up the good work.

688
00:45:55,281 --> 00:45:58,159
Remember,
by any means necessary.

689
00:46:15,594 --> 00:46:17,233
Look at yourself.

690
00:46:17,273 --> 00:46:20,591
You used to be so virile.

691
00:46:20,632 --> 00:46:23,710
You were a swinger, man.

692
00:46:23,751 --> 00:46:27,509
And now you're nothing.

693
00:46:27,509 --> 00:46:31,347
But at least
it can't get any worse.

694
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:33,827
Well, surprise, surprise, huh!

695
00:46:33,867 --> 00:46:36,306
Look at that meal.

696
00:46:36,386 --> 00:46:40,824
I’m dead sexy.
Look at my sexy body.

697
00:46:41,984 --> 00:46:43,943
Oh, look, I’m like a singer.

698
00:46:43,983 --> 00:46:47,301
Oh, sexy man, sexy man

699
00:46:47,342 --> 00:46:50,340
Eating like a sexy man can

700
00:46:50,381 --> 00:46:53,020
By the way,
would you like some chicken?

701
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,099
I’ve got more.

702
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,219
No, thanks.

703
00:46:56,259 --> 00:46:57,778
What have we got here?

704
00:46:57,818 --> 00:47:02,096
Done with that.
All right, that's done.

705
00:47:09,614 --> 00:47:13,572
Remember,
by any means necessary.

706
00:47:17,691 --> 00:47:19,970
Frisky, are we?

707
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:21,329
Give it up!

708
00:47:22,329 --> 00:47:23,928
Ladies and gentlemen...

709
00:47:23,969 --> 00:47:27,407
we're about to begin phase two
of our evil project...

710
00:47:27,447 --> 00:47:30,245
or is it phase--
I don't know phases.

711
00:47:30,286 --> 00:47:31,925
Anyways, this is the phase...

712
00:47:31,966 --> 00:47:36,364
in which we put
a giant “laser” on the moon.

713
00:47:36,404 --> 00:47:40,082
As you know, the moon rotates
around the Earth, like so.

714
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,839
When the moon reaches...

715
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,519
its appropriate
lunar alignment...

716
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,038
it will destroy
Washington D.C.

717
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:55,397
You see, I’ve turned the moon...

718
00:47:55,397 --> 00:47:59,955
into what I like to call
a “Death Star.”

719
00:48:01,595 --> 00:48:04,353
-What?
-Nothing, Darth.

720
00:48:04,394 --> 00:48:05,633
What did you call me?

721
00:48:05,673 --> 00:48:07,872
Nothing. Rip-off!

722
00:48:09,192 --> 00:48:10,511
Bless you.

723
00:48:10,551 --> 00:48:13,429
Anyways, the key to this plan
is the giant laser.

724
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:17,308
It was invented by the noted
Cambridge physicist Dr. Parsons.

725
00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:21,907
Therefore, we shall call it
the Alan Parsons Project.

726
00:48:21,947 --> 00:48:24,586
Oh, my God.

727
00:48:24,626 --> 00:48:25,825
What now?

728
00:48:25,866 --> 00:48:29,704
The Alan Parsons Project is a
progressive rock band in 1982.

729
00:48:29,744 --> 00:48:33,462
Why don't you just call it
“Operation Wang Chung,” ass?

730
00:48:33,503 --> 00:48:34,982
What should we--

731
00:48:35,022 --> 00:48:37,541
I’m sure “Operation Bananarama”
will be huge.

732
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,500
What are you saying?

733
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:40,420
-If you wanted--
-Shh!

734
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,619
Trying to be hip--

735
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:44,299
”WWW.shh.com.org.”

736
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:46,258
-You're so--
-Shh!

737
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:49,576
If we could put aside
the family squabbling...

738
00:48:49,617 --> 00:48:52,935
I think we could get down
to some serious business here.

739
00:48:52,936 --> 00:48:54,535
-Really?
-Yeah.

740
00:48:54,575 --> 00:48:56,374
I don't like that insolent tone.

741
00:48:56,414 --> 00:48:59,532
-l meant nothing by it.
-You want to run things?

742
00:48:59,533 --> 00:49:00,612
No, not at all.

743
00:49:00,653 --> 00:49:02,852
You want to be Daddy,
is that it?

744
00:49:02,892 --> 00:49:05,531
Number Two, you want to wear
the Daddy pants?

745
00:49:05,571 --> 00:49:07,170
You gonna cry?

746
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:10,248
You gonna cry?

747
00:49:10,289 --> 00:49:11,608
What are you doing?

748
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:14,328
Are you gonna squirt some?
You gonna cry?

749
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:17,086
See, you were gonna cry.
You're a big man now, huh?

750
00:49:17,127 --> 00:49:18,726
Yeah, thought so.

751
00:49:42,517 --> 00:49:44,836
About what happened last night--

752
00:49:44,876 --> 00:49:46,435
You don't have to explain.

753
00:49:47,675 --> 00:49:49,674
You don't understand.
You see...

754
00:49:51,594 --> 00:49:53,913
I’ve lost my mojo.

755
00:49:53,953 --> 00:49:56,831
Oh, so that's why you--

756
00:49:59,911 --> 00:50:01,670
I thought you didn't like me.

757
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:04,428
Oh, no, baby.
You're very shagadelic.

758
00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:06,468
I just didn't want
to fall in love again...

759
00:50:06,508 --> 00:50:09,786
and I thought you'd never
love me without my mojo.

760
00:50:09,787 --> 00:50:11,026
It’s not you.

761
00:50:11,067 --> 00:50:16,504
You're fab, switched on,
a bit of all right. Yes!

762
00:50:16,545 --> 00:50:18,544
That is so great.

763
00:50:18,584 --> 00:50:20,383
There's something
I should tell you, too.

764
00:50:20,423 --> 00:50:23,341
Last night, I planted
a homing device on Fat Bastard.

765
00:50:23,382 --> 00:50:24,661
Smashing, baby.

766
00:50:24,702 --> 00:50:26,301
Then we can track down
Fat Bastard...

767
00:50:26,301 --> 00:50:27,900
get my mojo,
go back to my place...

768
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:31,378
hop on the good foot
and do the bad thing. Yes!

769
00:50:31,419 --> 00:50:32,498
But there's more.

770
00:50:32,539 --> 00:50:34,938
In order to get close
to Fat Bastard, I had to--

771
00:50:34,978 --> 00:50:37,457
Hello, hello.
The signal's coming through.

772
00:50:37,497 --> 00:50:38,896
He's at Paddington Station.

773
00:50:38,936 --> 00:50:40,375
Let's go!

774
00:50:43,015 --> 00:50:45,054
-We're close, baby.
-This way.

775
00:50:45,094 --> 00:50:47,373
Straight--no, no, left.
Through here.

776
00:50:50,372 --> 00:50:51,411
We've got him.

777
00:50:51,452 --> 00:50:53,011
Private, bring up the ram.

778
00:50:58,209 --> 00:50:59,568
Go, go, go!

779
00:50:59,569 --> 00:51:01,048
Where is he?

780
00:51:02,128 --> 00:51:04,007
Oh, my God!

781
00:51:04,007 --> 00:51:06,725
Fat Bastard left a floater!

782
00:51:06,766 --> 00:51:08,925
In the name
of all things sacred...

783
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:11,843
that is the most
foul-smelling thing ever!

784
00:51:11,884 --> 00:51:13,643
Somebody flush it down!

785
00:51:13,643 --> 00:51:14,882
No, nobody touch anything.

786
00:51:14,923 --> 00:51:17,681
We have to get the sample
to the lab to be analyzed.

787
00:51:19,361 --> 00:51:20,960
I’m gonna give.

788
00:51:29,238 --> 00:51:30,517
Austin, there you are.

789
00:51:30,557 --> 00:51:31,796
Has the sample been analyzed?

790
00:51:31,837 --> 00:51:35,155
Cor, baby.
You look very shagadelic!

791
00:51:37,195 --> 00:51:39,874
But do we really have
to be here, Felicity?

792
00:51:39,874 --> 00:51:42,273
I mean, it's so boring.

793
00:51:42,313 --> 00:51:43,912
I don't believe in science.

794
00:51:43,952 --> 00:51:49,030
When it comes to the spy game,
to me, it's all instinct.

795
00:51:53,509 --> 00:51:55,748
-Hello, everybody.
-Hello, Basil.

796
00:51:55,788 --> 00:51:57,627
The results are in.

797
00:51:57,667 --> 00:52:00,585
We've discovered trace elements
of a rare vegetable...

798
00:52:00,626 --> 00:52:04,384
found only on one island,
here, in the Caribbean.

799
00:52:05,904 --> 00:52:08,383
What does it all mean, Basil?

800
00:52:08,423 --> 00:52:12,701
It means that this is
the location of Dr. Evil's lair.

801
00:52:12,741 --> 00:52:15,300
Smashing, Basil.

802
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:19,539
Cor!
This coffee smells like shit.

803
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:24,137
It is shit, Austin.

804
00:52:24,177 --> 00:52:26,975
Oh, good, then it's not just me.

805
00:52:31,215 --> 00:52:33,294
It’s a bit nutty.

806
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:44,769
Excuse me, Dr. Evil.

807
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:47,768
I have to speak to you
about this Mini-Me.

808
00:52:47,768 --> 00:52:49,167
He's not fitting in?

809
00:52:49,168 --> 00:52:52,326
Is he giving off too much
of a creepy Oompa Loompa vibe?

810
00:52:52,367 --> 00:52:55,125
No, it's just that he bites.

811
00:52:57,765 --> 00:52:59,164
He's a biter.

812
00:53:02,283 --> 00:53:04,402
What's wrong, Mini-Me?

813
00:53:04,442 --> 00:53:06,241
Something you want to tell us?

814
00:53:07,841 --> 00:53:08,880
Teething.

815
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:14,278
Get me the president
of the United States of America!

816
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:16,158
Oh, he's on.

817
00:53:16,158 --> 00:53:18,517
What do you want, Dr. Evil?

818
00:53:18,557 --> 00:53:20,556
Mr. President,
in twelve hours...

819
00:53:20,596 --> 00:53:26,193
I will destroy Washington D.C.
with this giant “laser.”

820
00:53:26,234 --> 00:53:28,513
What the--?

821
00:53:28,513 --> 00:53:32,951
Mini-Me, stop humping the laser.

822
00:53:32,992 --> 00:53:34,711
OK, honest to God...

823
00:53:34,751 --> 00:53:39,629
why don't you and the giant
laser get a frickin' room?

824
00:53:39,629 --> 00:53:43,387
Mr. President, after
I destroy Washington D.C...

825
00:53:43,388 --> 00:53:47,026
I will destroy another major
city every hour on the hour.

826
00:53:47,066 --> 00:53:49,345
That is, unless, of course,
you pay me...

827
00:53:50,505 --> 00:53:54,503
one hundred billion dollars.

828
00:53:59,222 --> 00:54:01,661
Dr. Evil, this is 1969.

829
00:54:01,701 --> 00:54:04,140
That amount of money
doesn't even exist.

830
00:54:05,939 --> 00:54:09,377
That's like saying, “l want
a kajillion bajillion dollars.”

831
00:54:11,178 --> 00:54:15,416
Come on, Mr. President,
show me the money.

832
00:54:15,456 --> 00:54:16,695
Show you what money?

833
00:54:16,735 --> 00:54:19,493
Show me the money,
show me the money.

834
00:54:19,534 --> 00:54:22,732
You had me at hello.
Tear. Nothing? No?

835
00:54:22,773 --> 00:54:25,571
Psst! It’s 1969.

836
00:54:25,612 --> 00:54:29,050
”Jerry Maguire” won't come out
for another thirty years.

837
00:54:29,091 --> 00:54:31,889
Nobody knows what
you're talking about, ass.

838
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:35,528
Scott, Daddy's working, OK?

839
00:54:35,569 --> 00:54:37,168
And when you're
in the main chamber...

840
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:39,567
try and use
the big boy voice, OK?

841
00:54:39,607 --> 00:54:40,886
Thank you.

842
00:54:42,246 --> 00:54:44,885
Mr. President,
allow me to demonstrate...

843
00:54:44,925 --> 00:54:48,203
the awesome lethality
of the Alan Parsons Project.

844
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:50,163
Fire the laser!

845
00:54:55,681 --> 00:54:57,800
Damage report! Damage report!

846
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,878
It’s OK.
It’s all right. Come on.

847
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:04,997
Actually, that was footage
from “Independence Day...”

848
00:55:05,038 --> 00:55:07,037
but the real laser
would be a lot like that.

849
00:55:07,077 --> 00:55:09,156
Yeah, scary.

850
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:12,034
Now, Dr. Evil--

851
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:15,913
Talk to the hand, 'cause
the face don't want to hear it.

852
00:55:15,994 --> 00:55:18,073
What hand? Talk to your hand?

853
00:55:18,113 --> 00:55:20,991
You ain't all that
and a bag of potato chips.

854
00:55:21,032 --> 00:55:22,551
What are you talking about?

855
00:55:22,591 --> 00:55:25,429
Don't go there, girlfriend.

856
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:28,269
Whose girlfriend?

857
00:55:28,309 --> 00:55:30,388
Don't mess with me,
I’m one crazy mo-fo.

858
00:55:30,428 --> 00:55:31,827
I had to pop a cop...

859
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,307
'cause he wasn't giving me
my props in Oaktown.

860
00:55:34,347 --> 00:55:36,626
No? I heard that somewhere.

861
00:55:37,745 --> 00:55:39,664
You're an idiot.

862
00:55:39,745 --> 00:55:43,943
Mr. President, I think
we have an understanding.

863
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:49,501
Dr. Evil, what are our plans
regarding Austin Powers?

864
00:55:49,541 --> 00:55:53,099
Austin Powers?
He's the snake to my mongoose.

865
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:58,697
Or the mongoose to my snake.
Either way, it's bad.

866
00:55:58,738 --> 00:56:00,137
I don't know animals.

867
00:56:00,137 --> 00:56:02,656
But I do know this--

868
00:56:02,696 --> 00:56:05,375
This time it's personal.

869
00:56:05,415 --> 00:56:07,094
Kill him.

870
00:56:12,373 --> 00:56:14,852
There's Dr. Evil's island.

871
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,799
Let's set up camp.

872
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:50,158
Be careful with that bag!

873
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:52,238
There's explosives in it.

874
00:56:53,237 --> 00:56:55,516
This could be dangerous.

875
00:57:04,953 --> 00:57:08,511
What if God was one of us?

876
00:57:09,511 --> 00:57:13,229
Just a slob like one of us

877
00:57:26,225 --> 00:57:27,464
Well done, very good.

878
00:57:27,505 --> 00:57:30,583
Dr. Evil, that was fantastic.

879
00:57:30,624 --> 00:57:32,303
Thank you, Number Two.

880
00:57:32,343 --> 00:57:33,742
I wrote that, yeah.

881
00:57:33,782 --> 00:57:36,341
Dad, he put this in my bed.

882
00:57:36,381 --> 00:57:37,540
Who?

883
00:57:37,581 --> 00:57:39,500
Your stupid mini-you.

884
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,779
He put road kill in my sheets!

885
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:45,897
What--Mini-Me,
don't you ever do that again.

886
00:57:45,938 --> 00:57:49,416
You hear me,
don't you ever do that again!

887
00:57:49,457 --> 00:57:51,616
I can't stay mad at you.

888
00:57:51,656 --> 00:57:53,295
Look at that punum.

889
00:57:54,455 --> 00:57:58,773
Dr. Evil's headquarters
is right over that next ridge.

890
00:57:58,813 --> 00:57:59,892
Let me look.

891
00:58:00,972 --> 00:58:02,811
Damn it. How do we get in?

892
00:58:02,852 --> 00:58:05,850
Hello, Mummy.
Can I have some chocolates?

893
00:58:05,891 --> 00:58:08,330
I want some Mars Bars.

894
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:10,009
Don't smack my bottom, Mummy.

895
00:58:11,049 --> 00:58:12,768
Sorry, love.

896
00:58:12,808 --> 00:58:15,646
I got stuck
in your dirty pillows.

897
00:58:15,647 --> 00:58:17,046
Let's look at the map.

898
00:58:20,245 --> 00:58:21,764
Austin, what's our plan?

899
00:58:21,805 --> 00:58:23,164
According to this map...

900
00:58:23,164 --> 00:58:26,722
the entire island is crawling
with Dr. Evil's guards.

901
00:58:26,763 --> 00:58:29,042
I want to make sure
the explosives didn't get wet...

902
00:58:29,082 --> 00:58:30,121
but I can't find them.

903
00:58:30,162 --> 00:58:32,081
Look in the bottom.

904
00:58:32,121 --> 00:58:34,760
OK, I’ll dig a little deeper.

905
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,799
Wow, this bag is really full.

906
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:39,918
Just keep digging, darling.

907
00:58:39,958 --> 00:58:42,037
I’ll just feel around for them.

908
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:46,555
Good lord, Austin.

909
00:58:46,595 --> 00:58:48,434
What do you keep in here?

910
00:58:48,435 --> 00:58:51,953
Anything that catches
my fancy, you know.

911
00:58:51,993 --> 00:58:52,952
Give it a good tug.

912
00:58:54,433 --> 00:58:56,352
Do we really need this?

913
00:58:56,392 --> 00:58:59,190
I’ll ask you not to open that
inside, thank you very much.

914
00:58:59,231 --> 00:59:01,590
Oh, my God.

915
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:03,589
Oops, it went off.

916
00:59:03,629 --> 00:59:06,228
Yes, it does that
from time to time.

917
00:59:06,268 --> 00:59:07,947
Eww. Yuck.

918
00:59:07,987 --> 00:59:09,906
Yeah, that's nasty.

919
00:59:09,947 --> 00:59:11,586
Yeah, sorry about that.

920
00:59:12,546 --> 00:59:13,745
Smelly.

921
00:59:13,785 --> 00:59:16,184
These people make me sick.

922
00:59:16,264 --> 00:59:17,543
Can you snap me a beer?

923
00:59:22,102 --> 00:59:23,221
What is it?

924
00:59:23,262 --> 00:59:24,461
It’s a gerbil.

925
00:59:24,501 --> 00:59:25,940
How did that get in your bag?

926
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,819
I don't know.

927
00:59:32,338 --> 00:59:35,776
Dr. Evil, we have a problem.

928
00:59:35,817 --> 00:59:37,696
Austin Powers is on the island.

929
00:59:37,736 --> 00:59:41,374
Bring him to me...alive.

930
00:59:41,415 --> 00:59:43,574
You.

931
00:59:43,654 --> 00:59:45,133
Hit it!

932
00:59:45,174 --> 00:59:48,292
This is
a very sensitive subject.

933
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:59,208
Just the two of us

934
01:00:01,208 --> 01:00:03,767
Just the two of us

935
01:00:03,807 --> 01:00:06,206
From the moment I heard
Frau say I had a clone

936
01:00:06,206 --> 01:00:08,645
I knew that I'd be safe
'cause I'd never be alone

937
01:00:08,685 --> 01:00:11,204
An evil doctor shouldn't
speak aloud about his feelings

938
01:00:11,244 --> 01:00:13,523
My hurt and my pain
don't make me too appealin'

939
01:00:13,563 --> 01:00:15,962
I’d hoped Scott
would look up to me

940
01:00:16,002 --> 01:00:18,681
Run the business of the family

941
01:00:18,721 --> 01:00:20,840
Head an evil empire
just like his dear old dad

942
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,319
Give him my love
and the things I never had

943
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,519
Scott would think
I was a cool guy

944
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:28,158
Return the love I have,
make me want to cry

945
01:00:28,198 --> 01:00:30,677
Be evil,
but have my feelings, too

946
01:00:30,717 --> 01:00:32,956
Change my life with
Oprah and Maya Angelou

947
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:35,475
But Scott rejected me,
c'est la vie

948
01:00:35,515 --> 01:00:37,874
Life is cruel,
treats you unfairly

949
01:00:37,914 --> 01:00:40,433
Even so, a God there must be

950
01:00:40,473 --> 01:00:42,392
Mini-Me, you complete me

951
01:00:42,432 --> 01:00:44,791
Just the two of us

952
01:00:44,792 --> 01:00:47,231
We can make it if we try

953
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:50,189
Just the two of us

954
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,989
Just the two of us

955
01:00:52,029 --> 01:00:54,947
Just the two of us

956
01:00:54,988 --> 01:00:57,107
Building castles in the sky

957
01:00:57,147 --> 01:00:59,226
Just the two of us

958
01:00:59,266 --> 01:01:00,905
You and l

959
01:01:12,022 --> 01:01:14,661
You've got this packed
really tight.

960
01:01:14,701 --> 01:01:16,700
Are you OK?

961
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:19,179
Yeah, I just got a bit
of a back cramp, that's all.

962
01:01:20,378 --> 01:01:22,257
Just keep packing it in.

963
01:01:22,298 --> 01:01:23,937
God.

964
01:01:23,977 --> 01:01:25,456
I found the explosives.

965
01:01:25,497 --> 01:01:26,736
Help me check them.

966
01:01:26,776 --> 01:01:28,615
You're surrounded!
Drop your weapons!

967
01:01:29,255 --> 01:01:30,574
Hands up!

968
01:01:31,974 --> 01:01:33,173
Move out!

969
01:01:36,772 --> 01:01:39,091
Ladies and gentlemen,
in just a few moments...

970
01:01:39,131 --> 01:01:42,369
we're going to place
a giant “laser” on the moon.

971
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:44,049
From my “Death Star...”

972
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:47,288
I will destroy
every city on the planet.

973
01:01:47,288 --> 01:01:48,567
Get off of me.

974
01:01:48,608 --> 01:01:52,326
Ah, Mr. Powers, Ms. Shagwell...

975
01:01:52,367 --> 01:01:54,806
welcome to my
hollowed-out volcano.

976
01:01:54,846 --> 01:01:57,125
This is my associate
Fat Bastard.

977
01:01:57,165 --> 01:02:03,122
Felicity, I think you two
may have already “met.”

978
01:02:03,163 --> 01:02:04,482
Unfortunately.

979
01:02:04,522 --> 01:02:08,320
Is that all the thanks I get
for the night of hot sex?

980
01:02:08,361 --> 01:02:11,239
I’m dead sexy.

981
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,119
You were crap!

982
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:17,157
In your dreams.

983
01:02:21,876 --> 01:02:25,034
Felicity would never
sleep with you.

984
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,993
Right?

985
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:28,793
I did what I had to do.

986
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:30,552
I’m a secret agent.

987
01:02:30,592 --> 01:02:32,311
What?

988
01:02:38,429 --> 01:02:40,828
All right, that's enough,
Fat Bastard.

989
01:02:40,869 --> 01:02:43,188
As much as I like
seeing Powers in agony--

990
01:02:43,228 --> 01:02:44,627
and I do--

991
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:47,505
the thought of you naked
is just gross.

992
01:02:47,546 --> 01:02:50,344
You can't stop me now,
Mr. Powers.

993
01:02:50,345 --> 01:02:52,504
I have your mojo...

994
01:02:52,504 --> 01:02:55,183
and I’m taking it with me
to the moon.

995
01:02:55,223 --> 01:02:57,102
Put them in a jail cell.

996
01:02:58,342 --> 01:03:02,260
My mojo! I’ll get you, Dr. Evil!

997
01:03:02,301 --> 01:03:04,940
Look at me, I’m shaking
in my little space boots.

998
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,859
I want my mojo!

999
01:03:06,899 --> 01:03:08,858
Great plan, Einstein.

1000
01:03:10,218 --> 01:03:12,457
You're gonna put him in a cell
with one inept guard...

1001
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:13,576
and they'll escape!

1002
01:03:13,616 --> 01:03:16,215
God, you do this every time!

1003
01:03:16,255 --> 01:03:19,813
You know, Scott...

1004
01:03:19,854 --> 01:03:25,212
I’ve been a frickin' evil doctor
for thirty frickin' years, OK?

1005
01:03:25,252 --> 01:03:28,050
Cut me some frickin' slack.

1006
01:03:28,091 --> 01:03:32,049
You forget, Scott,
we're in a volcano.

1007
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:35,808
We're surrounded
by liquid hot magma.

1008
01:03:37,368 --> 01:03:39,007
What are you drawing?

1009
01:03:40,766 --> 01:03:43,125
It’s just a good-bye card,
that's all.

1010
01:03:44,805 --> 01:03:46,324
It’s sweet.

1011
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:55,680
Hey, get him. Get the baby!

1012
01:03:55,721 --> 01:03:56,800
Back off.

1013
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,239
Simmer down. Simmer down.

1014
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:02,038
He's my posse.

1015
01:04:03,598 --> 01:04:05,837
You take special care of him.

1016
01:04:05,877 --> 01:04:07,996
He's my special boy.

1017
01:04:08,036 --> 01:04:10,874
Attention, prepare for launch.

1018
01:04:12,395 --> 01:04:16,633
Repeat, all technicians
to launch position.

1019
01:04:17,473 --> 01:04:21,591
Gentlemen,
I’m about to go to the moon.

1020
01:04:21,631 --> 01:04:25,069
Initiate pre-launch sequence.

1021
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:27,709
Main rocket engines, ignition.

1022
01:04:27,749 --> 01:04:28,828
Frau...

1023
01:04:28,869 --> 01:04:30,788
begin the countdown.

1024
01:04:30,828 --> 01:04:32,667
Five...four...

1025
01:04:32,667 --> 01:04:33,786
three...two--

1026
01:04:33,827 --> 01:04:36,466
Frau!
Begin the countdown at thirty.

1027
01:04:38,225 --> 01:04:39,184
Thirty!

1028
01:04:39,225 --> 01:04:41,704
twenty-nine...twenty-eight...

1029
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:43,543
twenty-seven...

1030
01:04:43,583 --> 01:04:45,782
twenty-six...twenty-five...

1031
01:04:45,822 --> 01:04:49,340
twenty-four...twenty-three...

1032
01:04:49,381 --> 01:04:52,339
twenty-two...twenty-one...

1033
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,659
twenty...nineteen...

1034
01:04:54,659 --> 01:04:56,138
eighteen....

1035
01:04:56,218 --> 01:05:00,016
seventeen...sixteen...

1036
01:05:00,057 --> 01:05:02,736
fifteen...fourteen...thirteen--

1037
01:05:02,776 --> 01:05:05,335
You know what?
When the doors close...

1038
01:05:05,375 --> 01:05:07,814
just say “go.” Better.

1039
01:05:12,212 --> 01:05:13,211
Go!

1040
01:05:42,481 --> 01:05:44,600
Colonel, you better
take a look at this radar.

1041
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,239
What is it, son?

1042
01:05:47,279 --> 01:05:49,198
I don't know, sir.

1043
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:50,398
But it looks like
a giant--

1044
01:05:50,438 --> 01:05:52,037
-Dick!
-Yeah?

1045
01:05:52,078 --> 01:05:53,317
Take a look out of starboard.

1046
01:05:53,317 --> 01:05:56,555
Oh, my God,
it looks like a huge--

1047
01:05:56,596 --> 01:05:58,475
-Pecker!
-Oh, where?

1048
01:05:58,515 --> 01:06:00,114
Wait, that's not a woodpecker.

1049
01:06:00,155 --> 01:06:01,114
It looks like someone's--

1050
01:06:01,154 --> 01:06:02,273
Privates!

1051
01:06:02,314 --> 01:06:04,953
We have reports of
an unidentified flying object.

1052
01:06:04,993 --> 01:06:08,831
It is a long, smooth shaft,
complete with--

1053
01:06:08,871 --> 01:06:11,669
Two balls! What is that?

1054
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:13,309
That looks just
like an enormous--

1055
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:14,749
Wang! Pay attention.

1056
01:06:14,789 --> 01:06:17,787
I was distracted by
that enormous flying--

1057
01:06:17,828 --> 01:06:19,187
-Willie...
-Yeah?

1058
01:06:19,228 --> 01:06:20,787
What's that?

1059
01:06:20,827 --> 01:06:22,946
Well, it looks
like a giant--

1060
01:06:22,986 --> 01:06:24,425
-Johnson?!
-Yes, sir.

1061
01:06:24,466 --> 01:06:27,624
Call British Intelligence
and let them know about this.

1062
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:44,378
What do we do?

1063
01:06:44,418 --> 01:06:47,536
Why don't you just shag
Fat Bastard again?

1064
01:06:47,577 --> 01:06:49,496
This is no time to get jealous.

1065
01:06:49,536 --> 01:06:51,175
How could you do it?

1066
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:52,375
I was just doing my job.

1067
01:06:52,415 --> 01:06:54,454
No, I mean literally,
how could you do it?

1068
01:06:54,495 --> 01:06:55,694
The man's so fat...

1069
01:06:55,734 --> 01:06:57,613
the sheer mechanics of it
are mind-boggling.

1070
01:06:57,653 --> 01:07:01,251
Don't lay your hang-ups on me,
just 'cause you lost your mojo.

1071
01:07:01,292 --> 01:07:03,691
Ouch, baby.

1072
01:07:03,731 --> 01:07:06,050
Very ouch.

1073
01:07:06,050 --> 01:07:08,369
Look, Austin,
we're running out of time.

1074
01:07:08,369 --> 01:07:09,888
I’m sorry.

1075
01:07:11,288 --> 01:07:14,166
I just did what I thought you
would do in the same situation.

1076
01:07:15,367 --> 01:07:17,486
You're the reason
that I became a spy.

1077
01:07:18,845 --> 01:07:23,163
I thought I wanted to be you,
but then I realized that...

1078
01:07:24,204 --> 01:07:26,363
I want to be with you.

1079
01:07:26,403 --> 01:07:28,202
You do?

1080
01:07:30,201 --> 01:07:31,800
Hang on, baby.

1081
01:07:31,841 --> 01:07:33,640
Alleyoop!

1082
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,719
We should talk about this later.

1083
01:07:36,759 --> 01:07:38,518
First we need to get past
that one inept guard.

1084
01:07:38,558 --> 01:07:39,877
Right, here's the plan.

1085
01:07:39,918 --> 01:07:42,557
What if I pretend to be ill
with food poisoning?

1086
01:07:42,597 --> 01:07:45,595
The guard, drawn by my cries
of pain, comes to investigate.

1087
01:07:45,636 --> 01:07:47,275
Meanwhile, you dig a pit...

1088
01:07:47,315 --> 01:07:48,914
line it with makeshift
punji sticks...

1089
01:07:48,954 --> 01:07:50,313
made from sharpened
toothbrushes.

1090
01:07:50,354 --> 01:07:52,753
The guard falls in,
Bob's your uncle, we escape.

1091
01:07:52,793 --> 01:07:53,912
What do you think?

1092
01:07:53,952 --> 01:07:55,871
That might work,
but what about this?

1093
01:07:57,791 --> 01:07:59,470
What do you think of these?

1094
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:01,149
Mommy.

1095
01:08:07,068 --> 01:08:09,147
What a...burn?

1096
01:08:11,666 --> 01:08:15,464
That sort of thing
could get a man...fired.

1097
01:08:17,264 --> 01:08:18,583
I think he was...

1098
01:08:18,623 --> 01:08:22,061
hot...for...you.

1099
01:08:22,102 --> 01:08:23,981
-That's enough.
-Yeah.

1100
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:34,057
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to my moon base.

1101
01:08:34,098 --> 01:08:39,016
You've all been chosen to be
part of my elite moon unit.

1102
01:08:39,056 --> 01:08:41,335
Which is divided into
two divisions...

1103
01:08:41,375 --> 01:08:43,334
Moon Unit Alpha...

1104
01:08:43,374 --> 01:08:45,253
and Moon Unit Zappa.

1105
01:08:45,293 --> 01:08:47,812
In exactly six hours...

1106
01:08:47,852 --> 01:08:50,650
the moon will move
in its orbit around the earth...

1107
01:08:50,691 --> 01:08:54,649
bringing Washington D.C.
within range of my giant...

1108
01:08:54,690 --> 01:08:56,769
”laser.”

1109
01:08:56,809 --> 01:08:59,128
Begin “laser...”

1110
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:00,967
ignition sequence.

1111
01:09:01,008 --> 01:09:03,327
Begin laser ignition!

1112
01:09:04,486 --> 01:09:08,564
Attention, Moon Unit Zappa
to firing stations.

1113
01:09:08,605 --> 01:09:11,044
Initiation sequence in progress.

1114
01:09:11,084 --> 01:09:13,123
OK, all right.

1115
01:09:16,442 --> 01:09:20,120
All I asked for was a frickin'
rotating chair, OK?

1116
01:09:23,599 --> 01:09:25,398
Getting a little afraid.

1117
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:28,597
I need an old priest
and a young priest.

1118
01:09:28,637 --> 01:09:31,156
The power of Christ compels you.

1119
01:09:31,196 --> 01:09:34,434
The power of Christ compels you.

1120
01:09:37,554 --> 01:09:41,392
Sick as a dog now.

1121
01:09:44,671 --> 01:09:46,270
Gonna vomit.

1122
01:09:53,748 --> 01:09:57,306
We need to hitch a ride
to the moon, baby.

1123
01:09:57,347 --> 01:10:00,026
Apollo Eleven is good to go.

1124
01:10:00,066 --> 01:10:01,625
Crew to all stations.

1125
01:10:03,145 --> 01:10:06,983
We will have liftoff
in T minus five seconds...

1126
01:10:06,983 --> 01:10:09,622
four...three...two.

1127
01:10:11,102 --> 01:10:12,661
We have liftoff.

1128
01:10:12,701 --> 01:10:14,340
Apollo Eleven
has cleared the tower...

1129
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:16,819
and is heading
for a rendezvous with the moon.

1130
01:10:25,376 --> 01:10:28,694
Arm the “laser.”

1131
01:10:28,695 --> 01:10:30,454
Arming the laser!

1132
01:10:30,494 --> 01:10:33,292
Attention,
arming the Death Star.

1133
01:10:33,293 --> 01:10:34,372
Battle stations.

1134
01:10:34,413 --> 01:10:35,852
Laser on!

1135
01:10:35,892 --> 01:10:38,850
All crew at battle stations.

1136
01:10:38,891 --> 01:10:40,930
Get me the president.

1137
01:10:40,931 --> 01:10:43,610
You're gonna like this part,
Mini-Me.

1138
01:10:43,650 --> 01:10:46,528
This is the part where
we threaten the world leader.

1139
01:10:46,568 --> 01:10:49,286
I know we do it every time,
however it is important to--

1140
01:10:56,805 --> 01:10:58,164
Where are you?

1141
01:10:58,204 --> 01:11:01,162
Can someone put a frickin' bell
on him or something?

1142
01:11:03,522 --> 01:11:04,721
Great!

1143
01:11:04,762 --> 01:11:06,961
Somebody get the stick.

1144
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,879
Just grab on to the hook,
all right?

1145
01:11:10,919 --> 01:11:12,398
You complete me.

1146
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:14,038
I love you.

1147
01:11:14,998 --> 01:11:17,037
Hang in there, Mini-Me.

1148
01:11:17,077 --> 01:11:18,876
If anything
should happen to you...

1149
01:11:18,916 --> 01:11:20,835
I don't know what I would do.

1150
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:23,634
I’d probably move on,
get another replica.

1151
01:11:23,635 --> 01:11:25,514
But there'd be
a ten-minute period there...

1152
01:11:25,554 --> 01:11:28,233
when I would just be
inconsolable.

1153
01:11:28,273 --> 01:11:30,712
We have your money, Dr. Evil,
but it wasn't easy.

1154
01:11:30,752 --> 01:11:33,111
Papa has to do some work, OK?

1155
01:11:33,151 --> 01:11:36,309
Well, you have exactly
thirty minutes to get it to me.

1156
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:37,789
Ciao.

1157
01:11:40,309 --> 01:11:41,548
Jiminy jumpin' Jesus,

1158
01:11:41,588 --> 01:11:44,027
I can't believe
we're gonna pay that madman.

1159
01:11:44,067 --> 01:11:46,026
I got nukes up the ying-yang.

1160
01:11:46,026 --> 01:11:48,944
Just let me launch one,
for God's sake.

1161
01:11:48,985 --> 01:11:51,664
Are you suggesting
that we blow up the moon?

1162
01:11:51,704 --> 01:11:54,063
Would you miss it?

1163
01:11:54,103 --> 01:11:55,342
Would you miss it?

1164
01:11:59,022 --> 01:12:02,980
Mission control,
the swinger has landed.

1165
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:06,419
Airlock, open.

1166
01:12:10,977 --> 01:12:12,096
Re-pressurize.

1167
01:12:12,137 --> 01:12:13,616
Let's find Dr. Evil.

1168
01:12:13,656 --> 01:12:15,935
Enjoy your stay on the moon.

1169
01:12:19,334 --> 01:12:21,013
There he is.

1170
01:12:23,253 --> 01:12:24,492
I’ll cover your rear.

1171
01:12:24,532 --> 01:12:26,611
No, you go ahead.

1172
01:12:26,651 --> 01:12:29,330
This time it's personal.

1173
01:13:31,827 --> 01:13:34,625
No more.
I can't take it anymore.

1174
01:13:35,586 --> 01:13:37,945
Peace?

1175
01:13:37,985 --> 01:13:40,024
You brought my glasses.

1176
01:13:40,104 --> 01:13:42,023
Bless your little heart.

1177
01:13:43,103 --> 01:13:44,542
Well, that's not right.

1178
01:13:46,062 --> 01:13:48,501
Don't--That's just--
Now I’m pissed.

1179
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:51,219
Judo flip!

1180
01:13:58,777 --> 01:14:01,376
Poor little bugger.

1181
01:14:01,416 --> 01:14:03,055
He's so small.

1182
01:14:03,096 --> 01:14:05,175
He's like a dog or something.

1183
01:14:06,174 --> 01:14:07,933
Poor little bugger.

1184
01:14:14,371 --> 01:14:16,290
Get off!

1185
01:14:33,244 --> 01:14:34,603
Get out of my suit!

1186
01:14:35,803 --> 01:14:38,122
It tickles. It tickles.

1187
01:14:43,001 --> 01:14:44,120
Gotcha!

1188
01:15:10,751 --> 01:15:12,230
Poor little bugger.

1189
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:14,669
I salute you.

1190
01:15:24,026 --> 01:15:25,385
All right, slap-head.

1191
01:15:25,425 --> 01:15:27,064
Turn around.

1192
01:15:27,104 --> 01:15:29,822
Where's my mojo?

1193
01:15:29,863 --> 01:15:32,701
Well, it looks like you
have a choice, Mr. Powers--

1194
01:15:32,742 --> 01:15:34,701
save the world...

1195
01:15:34,742 --> 01:15:36,981
or save your girlfriend.

1196
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:41,539
Don't worry about me, Austin.

1197
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:43,098
You've got to save the world.

1198
01:15:44,338 --> 01:15:45,297
Kill him!

1199
01:15:48,337 --> 01:15:49,536
Fire the “laser.”

1200
01:15:49,576 --> 01:15:50,695
Target locking.

1201
01:15:51,655 --> 01:15:52,774
God!

1202
01:15:52,815 --> 01:15:55,454
Laser set to full vitality.

1203
01:15:55,934 --> 01:15:57,013
Judo kick!

1204
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:05,249
You may have won the battle,
Mr. Powers...

1205
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:06,649
but you lost the war.

1206
01:16:09,769 --> 01:16:12,887
Wake up, Felicity. Wake up!

1207
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:14,526
Escape pod ninety-five.

1208
01:16:18,485 --> 01:16:20,084
I love you, Felicity.

1209
01:16:20,125 --> 01:16:21,604
I love you.

1210
01:16:21,644 --> 01:16:24,762
Dr. Evil! I’ll kill him!

1211
01:16:29,241 --> 01:16:30,160
Gotcha!

1212
01:16:37,318 --> 01:16:39,917
You shot me, you a-hole.

1213
01:16:40,917 --> 01:16:43,995
And now I’m going to kill you.

1214
01:16:45,036 --> 01:16:46,595
Before you do that...

1215
01:16:48,714 --> 01:16:50,353
know this...

1216
01:16:58,511 --> 01:17:00,550
I am your father.

1217
01:17:02,749 --> 01:17:04,028
Really?

1218
01:17:05,868 --> 01:17:07,307
No, not really.

1219
01:17:07,307 --> 01:17:08,746
I can't back that up.

1220
01:17:08,787 --> 01:17:11,865
Right. Idiot. Yes.

1221
01:17:11,906 --> 01:17:14,545
But isn't it interesting,
Mr. Powers...

1222
01:17:14,585 --> 01:17:16,944
that you would rather kill me...

1223
01:17:16,944 --> 01:17:19,223
than save
your precious Felicity?

1224
01:17:19,263 --> 01:17:21,302
What do you mean?

1225
01:17:21,342 --> 01:17:25,620
Remember, there's a time portal
in the main chamber.

1226
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:28,498
You could go back and save her.

1227
01:17:28,499 --> 01:17:30,098
I’ll do that.

1228
01:17:44,733 --> 01:17:45,852
Good work!

1229
01:18:01,327 --> 01:18:03,846
Well, it looks like you
have a choice, Mr. Powers--

1230
01:18:03,886 --> 01:18:07,524
save the world
or save your girlfriend.

1231
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:11,363
Don't worry about me, Austin.

1232
01:18:11,364 --> 01:18:12,563
You gotta save the world.

1233
01:18:14,282 --> 01:18:16,481
I choose love, baby.

1234
01:18:16,522 --> 01:18:19,041
Wait a tick. Who are you?

1235
01:18:19,081 --> 01:18:21,360
I’m you, ten minutes from now.

1236
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,999
Damn it! You are handsome.

1237
01:18:25,038 --> 01:18:26,557
I was just thinking the same.

1238
01:18:28,197 --> 01:18:30,396
We are sexy.

1239
01:18:30,436 --> 01:18:33,234
We are sexy bitches. Yeah!

1240
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:35,993
All right.
This is ri-goddamn-diculous.

1241
01:18:36,034 --> 01:18:37,273
Kill them both!

1242
01:18:43,792 --> 01:18:45,351
Fire the “laser.”

1243
01:18:45,391 --> 01:18:47,230
Listen, past Austin...

1244
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:49,429
can you save the world
while I go get the girl?

1245
01:18:49,429 --> 01:18:51,868
Sure, Austin-from-
ten-minutes-from-now.

1246
01:18:51,909 --> 01:18:54,068
Lock in target.

1247
01:18:54,108 --> 01:18:57,666
Laser set to full vitality.

1248
01:19:02,625 --> 01:19:05,583
Come on. Are you all right?
Yeah, come on.

1249
01:19:06,663 --> 01:19:07,782
You all right?

1250
01:19:07,823 --> 01:19:09,022
You OK?

1251
01:19:10,981 --> 01:19:14,179
Say, what's the policy
on ménage a trois?

1252
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:17,739
You are adorable!

1253
01:19:19,618 --> 01:19:22,536
Looking for this, Mr. Powers?

1254
01:19:22,577 --> 01:19:24,376
My mojo.

1255
01:19:25,536 --> 01:19:28,334
Self-destruct in
two minutes and counting.

1256
01:19:38,571 --> 01:19:39,690
Watch out!

1257
01:19:49,567 --> 01:19:51,486
See you in hell, Powers.

1258
01:19:55,925 --> 01:19:57,684
Hey, Austin-from-
ten-minutes-from-now!

1259
01:19:57,724 --> 01:20:00,962
This place is gonna blow.
Let's go. Come on.

1260
01:20:06,121 --> 01:20:09,359
Thirty seconds and counting.
Twenty-nine...

1261
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:12,318
-Let's go.
-My mojo!

1262
01:20:12,359 --> 01:20:13,398
We have to go now.

1263
01:20:13,438 --> 01:20:15,597
My mojo. I’m useless without it.

1264
01:20:15,637 --> 01:20:17,316
You've had it all along.

1265
01:20:17,357 --> 01:20:18,476
What do you mean?

1266
01:20:18,516 --> 01:20:20,795
You defeated Dr. Evil,
you saved the world...

1267
01:20:20,836 --> 01:20:22,675
and believe me,
you're gonna get the girl.

1268
01:20:27,833 --> 01:20:28,792
All right then, maybe later.

1269
01:20:28,833 --> 01:20:29,792
Yeah, come on.

1270
01:20:32,871 --> 01:20:33,990
Go!

1271
01:20:35,390 --> 01:20:37,349
I’ll set the controls for 1967.

1272
01:20:38,189 --> 01:20:41,627
Felicity, why don't you come
with me to 1999?

1273
01:20:41,668 --> 01:20:43,827
I don't know.
The Sixties were so groovy.

1274
01:20:43,867 --> 01:20:46,466
I want to see what happens
in the Seventies and Eighties.

1275
01:20:46,506 --> 01:20:48,065
The Seventies and the Eighties?

1276
01:20:48,105 --> 01:20:50,744
You're not missing anything.
I looked into it.

1277
01:20:50,784 --> 01:20:53,822
There's a gas shortage
and a Flock of Seagulls.

1278
01:20:53,863 --> 01:20:55,822
That's about it.

1279
01:20:57,902 --> 01:20:59,581
Let's go.

1280
01:21:20,573 --> 01:21:22,332
I love you, Austin Powers.

1281
01:21:22,373 --> 01:21:25,012
And I love you,
Felicity Shagwell.

1282
01:21:25,052 --> 01:21:27,171
Wherever we go...

1283
01:21:27,171 --> 01:21:28,970
there we are.

1284
01:21:31,089 --> 01:21:33,448
Special delivery.

1285
01:21:36,048 --> 01:21:38,167
Surprise, surprise.

1286
01:21:39,446 --> 01:21:43,604
Listen, missy,
do you fancy another go?

1287
01:21:43,645 --> 01:21:48,083
'Cause once you've had fat,
you never go back.

1288
01:21:48,123 --> 01:21:50,802
You shut your mouth,
you bastard...

1289
01:21:52,322 --> 01:21:54,161
who is fat.

1290
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:55,240
Yeah, that's very good.

1291
01:21:55,281 --> 01:21:58,599
Before you kill us,
let me ask you one question.

1292
01:21:58,639 --> 01:21:59,958
Are you happy?

1293
01:21:59,999 --> 01:22:02,438
What kind of stupid ass
question is that?

1294
01:22:02,518 --> 01:22:05,756
I’m rich, and I’m dead sexy.

1295
01:22:13,514 --> 01:22:15,193
You didn't answer my question.

1296
01:22:15,233 --> 01:22:16,712
Are you happy?

1297
01:22:16,753 --> 01:22:18,552
Of course I’m not happy.

1298
01:22:18,592 --> 01:22:21,310
Look at me, I’m a big fat slob.

1299
01:22:21,351 --> 01:22:24,109
I’ve got bigger titties
than you do.

1300
01:22:24,150 --> 01:22:27,868
I’ve got more chins
than a Chinese phone book.

1301
01:22:27,908 --> 01:22:30,267
I’ve not seen my willie
in two years...

1302
01:22:30,268 --> 01:22:33,906
which is long enough
to declare it legally dead.

1303
01:22:36,065 --> 01:22:39,703
I can't stop eating.

1304
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:42,183
I eat because I’m unhappy.

1305
01:22:45,262 --> 01:22:48,340
I’m unhappy because I eat.

1306
01:22:48,381 --> 01:22:50,500
It’s a vicious cycle.

1307
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:52,899
If you'll excuse me...

1308
01:22:52,939 --> 01:22:56,297
there's someone I have to get
in touch with and forgive.

1309
01:22:57,457 --> 01:22:59,136
Myself.

1310
01:23:03,335 --> 01:23:05,374
Oh, God.

1311
01:23:05,415 --> 01:23:08,373
Sorry, I farted.

1312
01:23:10,053 --> 01:23:11,572
It’s a long road ahead.

1313
01:23:14,211 --> 01:23:16,010
Who am I kidding?

1314
01:23:16,011 --> 01:23:17,290
I’m going to kill you anyway.

1315
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:18,689
Judo chop!

1316
01:23:20,569 --> 01:23:24,087
Right in the mommy-daddy button!

1317
01:23:24,128 --> 01:23:26,607
That's for calling me crap,
you fatty.

1318
01:23:36,363 --> 01:23:38,962
Listen, baby, I don't care
if he is a Fat Bastard...

1319
01:23:38,962 --> 01:23:41,321
you don't give a man
a shot in the pills.

1320
01:23:41,361 --> 01:23:43,000
It’s just not cricket.

1321
01:23:43,041 --> 01:23:45,999
Do you think I’ll be happy
here in the Nineties?

1322
01:23:46,039 --> 01:23:48,757
Well, I know the Nineties
might sound boring...

1323
01:23:48,798 --> 01:23:51,317
but as far as I’m concerned...

1324
01:23:51,357 --> 01:23:55,955
I’ve brought the best part
of the Sixties back with me.

1325
01:23:55,996 --> 01:23:57,235
You.

1326
01:23:57,275 --> 01:23:58,874
Wait a minute.

1327
01:23:58,915 --> 01:24:00,354
Where are you going?

1328
01:24:44,978 --> 01:24:46,617
Did we get Dr. Evil?

1329
01:24:46,657 --> 01:24:49,455
No. He got away in that rocket
that looks like a huge...

1330
01:24:49,496 --> 01:24:50,535
Penis.

1331
01:24:50,576 --> 01:24:53,334
The male reproductive organ.

1332
01:24:53,374 --> 01:24:56,292
Also known as tally whacker,
schlong, or...

1333
01:24:56,293 --> 01:24:57,492
Wiener?

1334
01:24:57,533 --> 01:24:59,572
Any of you kids
want another wiener?

1335
01:24:59,612 --> 01:25:01,851
Dad, what's that?

1336
01:25:01,891 --> 01:25:04,530
I don't know, son,
but it's got great big...

1337
01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:07,009
Nuts! Hot, salty nuts!

1338
01:25:07,049 --> 01:25:09,608
Who wants some?
Lord almighty!

1339
01:25:09,648 --> 01:25:11,327
That looks just like
my husband's...

1340
01:25:11,368 --> 01:25:13,167
One-eyed monster.

1341
01:25:13,207 --> 01:25:15,726
Step right up and see
the one-eyed monster!

1342
01:25:17,685 --> 01:25:19,084
Hey, what's that?

1343
01:25:19,125 --> 01:25:20,804
It looks like a big...

1344
01:25:20,804 --> 01:25:22,963
Woody! Woody Harrelson?

1345
01:25:23,003 --> 01:25:24,602
Can I have your autograph?

1346
01:25:24,643 --> 01:25:25,842
Sure, no problem.

1347
01:25:25,882 --> 01:25:28,680
Oh, my Lord. Look at that thing.

1348
01:25:28,721 --> 01:25:29,880
It’s so big.

1349
01:25:29,921 --> 01:25:31,680
I’ve seen bigger. That's...

1350
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:33,599
Just a little prick.

1351
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,399
It’s a flu shot.

1352
01:25:35,439 --> 01:25:37,438
You've been
in the coldness of space.

1353
01:25:37,478 --> 01:25:39,477
I don't want you to get sick.

1354
01:25:39,517 --> 01:25:41,556
It’s one thing to attack me.

1355
01:25:41,597 --> 01:25:44,116
It’s quite another
to attack my Mini-Me.

1356
01:25:44,156 --> 01:25:47,034
I’m gonna get you,
Austin Powers.

1357
01:25:47,075 --> 01:25:48,994
I’m gonna get you.

1358
01:26:06,387 --> 01:26:09,265
Thank you. Welcome back.
Today we're doing a follow-up...

1359
01:26:09,306 --> 01:26:10,905
to a segment
we did several months ago...

1360
01:26:10,946 --> 01:26:13,465
on “Fathers who are trying
to take over the world.”

1361
01:26:13,505 --> 01:26:15,944
Let's begin with Scott Evil.

1362
01:26:18,983 --> 01:26:21,022
What's going on with your dad?

1363
01:26:21,062 --> 01:26:22,421
Well, my dad tried to take
over the world...

1364
01:26:22,461 --> 01:26:24,460
with a giant laser on the moon.

1365
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:26,699
I know.

1366
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:28,699
We have a surprise for you.

1367
01:26:28,739 --> 01:26:29,898
What, my dad?

1368
01:26:29,939 --> 01:26:32,298
No, it's not your father.
It’s your mother.

1369
01:26:32,338 --> 01:26:33,417
Come on out.

1370
01:26:40,175 --> 01:26:41,654
Mom?

1371
01:26:41,694 --> 01:26:46,252
Scott, you are my love child
with Dr. Evil.

1372
01:26:46,293 --> 01:26:48,532
I thought
I was a test-tube baby.

1373
01:26:48,572 --> 01:26:50,851
Lies. All lies!

1374
01:26:52,730 --> 01:26:54,169
I love you, Mom.

1375
01:26:55,409 --> 01:26:57,448
I love you, too, son.

1376
01:27:02,647 --> 01:27:04,086
Thank you.

1377
01:27:04,126 --> 01:27:07,004
You know,
what have we learned here today?

1378
01:27:07,045 --> 01:27:10,603
Perhaps it's that
no one can take your mojo.

1379
01:27:10,644 --> 01:27:12,843
You can look around
all you want...

1380
01:27:12,883 --> 01:27:16,281
but what you're really trying
to find is on the inside.

1381
01:27:16,321 --> 01:27:19,039
Take care of yourself
and each other.

1382
01:27:24,998 --> 01:27:27,956
I think I’m gonna like it
in the Nineties.

1383
01:27:27,997 --> 01:27:30,556
I never knew
it could be this way!

1384
01:27:30,596 --> 01:27:32,315
Oh, baby, baby, baby.

1385
01:27:36,834 --> 01:27:38,193
That's good.

1386
01:27:42,832 --> 01:27:43,991
How could you?

1387
01:27:44,031 --> 01:27:45,630
I thought that--

1388
01:27:45,671 --> 01:27:48,070
Past Austin?

1389
01:27:48,110 --> 01:27:51,388
Technically,
it's not cheating, baby.

1390
01:27:51,428 --> 01:27:54,306
Felicity, I can't blame you.

1391
01:27:54,347 --> 01:27:57,105
The man is handsome, baby!

1392
01:27:57,146 --> 01:27:59,225
We're just plain handsome, man.

1393
01:27:59,266 --> 01:28:02,544
Am I wrong,
but this makes me horny, baby.

1394
01:28:02,584 --> 01:28:03,903
Very randy!

1395
01:28:04,983 --> 01:28:06,862
Well, one thing's for sure--

1396
01:28:06,903 --> 01:28:09,382
I’ve got my mojo back.

1397
01:28:11,501 --> 01:28:13,100
It’s definitely back.

1398
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:14,819
Hello. You all right?

1399
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:17,978
Me spuds are boiling.

1400
01:28:20,778 --> 01:28:23,097
Come on, darling,
let's hop on the good foot...

1401
01:28:23,137 --> 01:28:24,576
and do the bad thing.

1402
01:28:24,616 --> 01:28:26,495
Paging Dr. Freud.

1403
01:30:42,845 --> 01:30:44,804
Hello up there.

1404
01:30:44,844 --> 01:30:46,523
Is the movie over?

1405
01:30:46,564 --> 01:30:48,003
I’m still down here...

1406
01:30:48,043 --> 01:30:49,882
and I’m still in
quite a lot of pain.

1407
01:30:49,922 --> 01:30:52,441
Maybe someone in the lobby
could call an ambulance.

1408
01:30:52,481 --> 01:30:54,840
Oh, the pain
is really quite severe.

1409
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:57,359
I've fashioned
a makeshift splint.

1410
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:58,759
Here goes nothing.
