JAPANESE HORROR ANTHOLOGY -
HORROR OF TRUTH -

3
00:00:27,774 --> 00:00:33,770
Is the world in front of you
presently a world of reality?

4
00:00:33,847 --> 00:00:38,216
If someone asks you such a
question, you may laugh.

5
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:44,882
But there may be ones who lost
their confidence for a moment.

6
00:00:45,892 --> 00:00:49,123
Yes, it is not you.

7
00:00:49,196 --> 00:00:52,029
The one beside you...

8
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:01,871
MORTUARY

9
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:24,163
Sorry... I was unable to help you.

10
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:28,691
You're still a medical student.
Take it easy.

11
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:33,035
It's unbelievable that
he wasn't killed instantly.

12
00:01:33,106 --> 00:01:37,440
Doctor! Please go to
operation room number two.

13
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:38,500
Sure.

14
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,378
Hey, trainee!

15
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:50,513
To the mortuary.

16
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,955
What? To the mortuary?

17
00:01:52,025 --> 00:01:54,459
- Wait until his family arrives.
- But, l...

18
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:55,517
Take this too.

19
00:01:56,897 --> 00:01:57,886
But...

20
00:03:27,554 --> 00:03:28,543
Get aside.

21
00:03:28,622 --> 00:03:31,090
The corpse spoke!

22
00:03:31,157 --> 00:03:33,682
That's sound of gas in his chest.

23
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,818
What? A gas?

24
00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:37,125
That happens. Now go back.

25
00:03:37,197 --> 00:03:38,721
We have a critical patient.

26
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:59,409
I sympathize with you
in your great grief indeed.

27
00:04:08,862 --> 00:04:12,127
Umm... please let me explain.

28
00:04:20,574 --> 00:04:23,304
Take a seat, if you will.

29
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:35,954
In this case,
at the time of collision,

30
00:04:36,022 --> 00:04:38,115
most of his organs were ruptured...

31
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:39,624
Doctor.

32
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:43,755
My son...

33
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,819
What is it?

34
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:48,126
My son is still alive.

35
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,859
What?

36
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:54,404
He is still alive.

37
00:04:57,744 --> 00:05:00,235
No... but...

38
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:07,181
Sorry. Perhaps there was
some kind of confusion.

39
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:12,181
Do you know the name
of the nurse who's in charge?

40
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:13,691
I guess not.

41
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:21,858
Will you tell me your name?

42
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:24,266
I'm Yamada.

43
00:05:24,337 --> 00:05:26,032
Thank you.

44
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:31,103
Please answer!

45
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:48,953
Where have you been, Makoto?
I have been looking for you.

46
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:59,200
Who are you talking to?

47
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:06,303
It was his birthday present.

48
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:11,715
You're going to become
a car racer, right?

49
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:17,483
We're going to the park
with his car tomorrow.

50
00:06:17,557 --> 00:06:19,354
Right, Makoto?

51
00:06:23,663 --> 00:06:26,632
Mrs. Yamada... are you alright?

52
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:31,233
Say hello to the doctor, Makoto.

53
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,787
Makoto, you should not
sleep in such a place.

54
00:06:49,856 --> 00:06:52,051
You give too much trouble.

55
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,225
Mrs. Yamada.

56
00:06:56,963 --> 00:07:01,559
Excuse me, doctor.
I will wake him up now.

57
00:07:01,634 --> 00:07:06,833
Makoto, Makoto.

58
00:07:06,906 --> 00:07:11,639
Makoto, wake up, Makoto.

59
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:14,373
Mrs. Yamada, that boy has...

60
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:16,643
Yes?

61
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:24,219
That boy has already... deceased.

62
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:27,625
A few moments ago,

63
00:07:28,828 --> 00:07:30,557
he has passed away.

64
00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:40,338
Doctor, he is just sleeping.

65
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:43,739
Makoto, Makoto, wake up.

66
00:07:50,517 --> 00:07:54,613
There's no pulse.

67
00:07:59,025 --> 00:08:00,925
Do not lose your mind.

68
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:10,760
Makoto, Makoto, wake up,
let's go back.

69
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:16,208
Makoto, Makoto, wake up.

70
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:33,817
Yes?

71
00:08:33,893 --> 00:08:36,384
Doctor?

72
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:38,123
Just a moment.

73
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:42,161
What's the matter with him?

74
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:45,967
What?

75
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:49,566
<i>The patient is deceased,</i>
<i>so take the body there...</i>

76
00:08:49,642 --> 00:08:52,406
What? The boy's body is here.

77
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:53,877
<i>They're mother and child.</i>

78
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:57,041
What? Mother and child?

79
00:08:57,116 --> 00:09:01,143
<i>She's dead. They were both</i>
<i>involved in an accident.</i>

80
00:09:01,221 --> 00:09:02,745
<i>She is his Mother.</i>

81
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:06,453
Mother?

82
00:09:08,361 --> 00:09:09,851
Doctor?

83
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,361
No... his Mother is here.

84
00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:16,595
<i>What are you saying!</i>

85
00:09:16,669 --> 00:09:20,298
Doctor! My boy...

86
00:09:20,373 --> 00:09:21,362
Mother?

87
00:09:23,943 --> 00:09:26,503
Please save my boy quickly.

88
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,444
Please save my boy.

89
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:32,815
Who are...

90
00:09:35,321 --> 00:09:37,789
What are you?

91
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:39,688
Quickly!

92
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:44,057
Quickly!

93
00:09:54,674 --> 00:09:57,234
You don't have to care about me.

94
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:00,408
Help...

95
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:08,016
my boy quickly.

96
00:10:14,227 --> 00:10:16,024
Help...

97
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:23,260
my boy quickly.

98
00:10:27,774 --> 00:10:30,675
Help...

99
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:41,918
Makoto quickly.

100
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,418
Quickly.

101
00:11:01,908 --> 00:11:06,845
Please don't run away, doctor.

102
00:11:08,648 --> 00:11:11,947
Help my boy quickly.

103
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:17,389
I was unable to do a thing.

104
00:11:17,457 --> 00:11:18,856
Nothing but to look.

105
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:21,358
Nothing but to look.

106
00:11:23,262 --> 00:11:25,492
Doctor.

107
00:11:25,565 --> 00:11:28,159
It was too late for treatment.

108
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:32,933
Don't come, don't... don't.

109
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:42,205
<i>Hey, trainee!</i>

110
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,414
Hey, trainee!

111
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:53,015
I called you.
Why didn't you come?

112
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:56,789
Now stand up!
We're going back again.

113
00:11:56,863 --> 00:12:01,493
If you're like that, you won't
be able to manage this job.

114
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:56,387
Mother.

115
00:13:13,473 --> 00:13:16,874
This multicolored world
we call our world.

116
00:13:16,943 --> 00:13:20,344
I'm staying here,
want to stay here,

117
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:22,210
and wanted to stay here.

118
00:13:23,216 --> 00:13:26,447
At the moment you accept
your inevitable destiny,

119
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:31,047
you'll just find the bright
white world spreading.

120
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:35,561
And eventually as you
regain your eyesight,

121
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:40,156
what will you see?
