00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:27,588

- Fucking dingleberry.

00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:30,424
You called him a what?

00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:31,902
- A dingleberry.
- Okay, calm-calm...

because he ain't worth shit.

43
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,237
Okay, calm... calm down, calm down.

44
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,614
Look, you'll be able...
we'll figure it out.

45
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:36,847
Come on, let's just go.

46
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:38,931
- It's not the end of the world. It's okay.
- Shit.

47
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,644
- SEAN: For you, it's not.
- KUNLE: We're okay.

48
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,688
Hi, class. Sorry I'm late.

49
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:46,899
(sighs) Whew, goodness.

50
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,776
Okay, so if you've done the reading...

51
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,778
Which you should have...

52
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,656
You'd have noticed that there's
a big old trigger warning

53
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,617
next to the syllabus on today's class.

54
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,994
And I know that we're
inches away from spring break,

55
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:01,831
but if you could just maintain
your focus and respectability

56
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,041
till the end of the day,
I'll be most appreciative.

57
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,043
Okay, so we good to go?

58
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,504
- I found some extra tickets to Blackout.
- Really?

59
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:10,023
PROFESSOR CLARKE:
So we've been talking about

60
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,882
the power of language,

61
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:15,553
and today we're going to be
talking about hate speech.

62
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,514
Now, before I go any further,

63
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,307
I just feel like I need to restate

64
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:21,934
the trigger warning, so are we good?

65
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:25,354
- (whispers): That's cute.
- Stop.

66
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:28,983
CLARKE: Yeah, okay, so let's
talk about the infamous...

67
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,485
...N-word.

68
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:40,411
The word "nigger" has had a
very long and terrible history.

69
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:46,292
It occupies a unique space in
the modern American vernacular.

70
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,169
The word's so taboo that it's
clearly making a lot of you

71
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,690
feel uncomfortable with me just
saying it right here right now

72
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:54,800
in a very isolated academic context.

73
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:57,678
Now, my question is to you lot:

74
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:02,266
What makes this word so powerful?

75
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,685
Anybody.

76
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,186
Yes.

77
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,273
I mean, because it's racist.

78
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:13,360
CLARKE: I think we could
all agree it is racist, yes.

79
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:15,154
But there are many racist,
offensive words.

80
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,655
What makes "nigger" different?

81
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,240
It originates from the Spanish...

82
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:20,451
Hey. Is that shit even allowed?

83
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,286
It's on the syllabus.

84
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,915
Um, there-there was a...
a trigger warning.

85
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,374
Trigger warning, these nuts.

86
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,436
- That shit is not right.
- CLARKE: And then, of course,

87
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,295
with an "A" at the end, we've got "nigga."

88
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,213
Bro, she keeps fucking saying it.

89
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,983
- KUNLE: Okay.
- SEAN: She just said "nigga" three times.

90
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,175
KUNLE:
But, uh, okay.

91
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,093
Well, what do you want me to do about it?

92
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:39,905
- Ask her. Inquire about it.
- I-m-I'm not asking her.

93
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:41,448
- Ask her, Kunle.
- I'm not gonna ask her.

94
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:42,657
You don't want to ask. Ask her.

95
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:43,742
She can't answer this question?

96
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:45,059
She's British.

97
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,727
May-Maybe she just doesn't know.

98
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,687
Give a fuck if she British, boy?

99
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:50,522
Ask her, why is she teaching a class

100
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,816
on some shit she don't know shit about?

101
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,152
I, um, don't want to put you two

102
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,238
on the spot or anything, but...

103
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,324
you must have something to say.

104
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:04,370
Please. This is a safe space.

105
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,873
What do you think it is that
keeps this word so powerful?

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,003
(bell chiming)

107
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,756
KUNLE:
Look, it was...

108
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,383
Sean, if it bothered you so much,

109
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,051
you could have said something.

110
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,303
You could have said anything.
You didn't say a word.

111
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:22,627
You just... you just sat there.

112
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,516
Yeah, in silent protest.

113
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,184
- Okay, silent protest.
- BIANCA: Kunle?

114
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,436
Oh, shit. Okay, okay, um... act cool.

115
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,289
- Do I have anything in my nose? I'm okay?
- BIANCA: Kunle.

116
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,524
- Hey. Guys.
- Just be cool. Be cool, Sean. Be cool.

117
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,484
- Hi.
- Hey.

118
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,486
That was... ooh.

119
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:38,654
W-Weird.

120
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,322
Fucked-up is what it was.

121
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:43,051
- BIANCA: She should not have put you guys on the spot like that.
- No.

122
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,327
I'm on the Student Senate,
if you guys want to, like,

123
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,329
start a movement or something.

124
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:49,540
- Uh...
- But it's totally up to you.

125
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,041
Like, no pressure.

126
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,335
Yeah, no, no, no. No, pressure. We, um...

127
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:56,338
- We will think about it.
- BIANCA: Cool.

128
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:58,340
- (Bianca laughs)
- (chuckling): Yeah, uh...

129
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:00,926
So, uh, you...

130
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,429
So, you going out tonight, B?

131
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,265
Uh, for once, I am.

132
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,975
- Mm.
- Yeah, got a pass to Underground.

133
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,977
- KUNLE: Nice. Nice.
- SEAN: Oh, shit.

134
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,353
Nice. That's really good.

135
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:13,230
BIANCA:
Yeah. Are-are you guys?

136
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,066
Yeah. Yeah, we're just gonna go
to a couple parties and...

137
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,359
BIANCA:
Cool.

138
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,361
Seven parties, actually.

139
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:21,405
Are you guys doing a Legendary Tour?

140
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,907
- Mm-hmm.
- BIANCA: Wow, wow, wow.

141
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,744
(laughs) It took me
three weeks of ass kissing

142
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,537
just to get into one.

143
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,681
- KUNLE: Oof.
- Lot of butt.

144
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:30,706
BIANCA:
So... lot of butt.

145
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:31,850
- Oh, God. (chuckles)
- Lot of butt.

146
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:33,059
Good thing you didn't get pink eye.

147
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,334
(Kunle laughs)

148
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,129
- (chuckles)
- From all the ass kissing.

149
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,008
Yeah, it's not really...
it's not really about

150
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,926
the, uh... the-the parties, though.

151
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,970
It's just this inside joke
that-that we've had

152
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:46,430
- since freshman year.
- Oh.

153
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,932
We actually are gonna be
the first Black men

154
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,643
to complete a Legendary Tour here
at Buchanan.

155
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,228
- Right.
- Is that...

156
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,522
like, something that people keep track of?

157
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,524
- Well, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

158
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,735
SEAN:
<i>See, the Black Student Union,</i>

159
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,945
<i>right, they got this thing
called the Hall of Firsts.</i>

160
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,906

161
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,575

162
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,058

163
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,471

164

SEAN: <i>First Black

165
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,916

that's not due to academics,</i>

166
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,460

167
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,003

168
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:19,647

00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,381
<i>We're gonna make history today,</i>

170
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,625
being the first Black men
to complete a Legendary Tour.

171
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,219
- Right.
- We're actually going to get

172
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,304
- our Blackout passes right now.
- KUNLE: Right.

173
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,865
- Cool. Text me.
- I'll te... I'll text you.

174
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,682
- Okay.
- Bye.

175
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:32,017
Bye.

176
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:34,269
(sighs)

177
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,689
She wants your dick, bro.

178
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:38,816
No, she's just being nice.

179
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,110
Yeah, she is being nice... to your dick.

180
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:44,488
("Act Up" by Terry Presume playing)

181
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:52,121
KUNLE:
Wait, okay, on-on the other hand,

182
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,039
it's a class about blasphemy and taboos.

183
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:56,043
Like, it's literally called
Blasphemy and Taboos.

184
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,543
- Mm-hmm.
- If we got her fired,

185
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,253
would that be censorship?

186
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,796
'Cause I'm against censorship.

187
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:01,981
That was some willy-nilly-ass shit.

188
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,233
Like, she didn't have to say it.

189
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,818
She just wanted to. She wanted a reaction.

190
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:05,968
Whoa, wait, wait, wait.

191
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,654
Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

192
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,013
But that was kind of the point, right?

193
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,765
To analyze us.

194
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,518
She wants to analyze
why we reacted that way.

195
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,186
Like, why is it so bad?

196
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,438
Think about this. So, there's a white man.

197
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,357
He's in the woods alone, all right?

198
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,025
He says the N-word. Is it bad?

199
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,735
Wait, your white man goes to the forest

200
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,588
- just to say the N-word?
- Well, no, no. He's never...

201
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,298
He... Okay, think about it.
He's never said it before.

202
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,842
- Uh-huh.
- He will never say it again.

203
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,826
And he doesn't hate us.
He's not, like, that type.

204
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,829
He just wants to just
whisper it quietly to himself.

205
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,831
You, just, you know...

206
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,291
(whispers):
"Nigger."

207
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,334
(laughs) It's fucked-up, dummy.

208
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,003
- What?
- What? That's fucked...

209
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,689
You're such an Oreo, trying to justify it.

210
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,256
I'm not... (groans) I'm not a...

211
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,984
- Okay, think about this...
- Look, look, look. Look, calm down.

212
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,277
You're thinking about it
too much, all right?

213
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,719
It's not that complicated.

214
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,346
We got one rule that we ask
for white people to respect.

215
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,190
- Mm-hmm.
- Thou shalt not say this one word.

216
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,474
- Right?
- Right.

217
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,560
But they don't like for us
to tell them what to do.

218
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,353
So they find loopholes.

219
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:01,398
So when your white man says
"nigger" in the forest,

220
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,609
he breaketh the covenant, all right?

221
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,903
It's not, like, evil-evil,

222
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,363
like, you know, "rawr,"

223
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,823
but it's disrespectful.

224
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,627
- Right.
- Anybody ever called you a nigger?

225
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,035
You call me "nigga" all the time.

226
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,329
- No, nigga, not like that. I mean, like...
- (laughing)

227
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,914
To your fucking face.

228
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,373
Yeah, I don't know, like, online,

229
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:19,625
people say the word, like...

230
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,084
No, not-not online.

231
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:24,296
Like, disrespectful,
right here to your face.

232
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,547
No.

233
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:27,382
Oh, well, fuck it.

234
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,719
♪ I'm already doing too much ♪

235
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:34,431
♪ Reach down in my pocket,
my wallet missing, boy, tighten up... ♪

236
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,768
KUNLE:
I just can't go too hard tonight.

237
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,811
I have to be back here
really early in the morning

238
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,021
to check my cultures.

239
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,273
You sound like a young mom, Le.

240
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,399
(Kunle laughs)

241
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,193
Them like your little fungus babies.

242
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:47,876
(Nigerian accent):
They are the bacteria.

243
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,780
And yes, they are my little babies.

244
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,114
(smacks lips) Mm-hmm.

245
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,950
Yeah, who's gonna get Daddy published?

246
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,743
(high-pitched voice):
Hmm? Who? We are.

247
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,370
Yes, you are.

248
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,623
(normal voice):
What?

249
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,793
You think maybe you should, I don't know,

250
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,920
work on your thesis this week?

251
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,130
'Cause your paper will not write itself.

252
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,608
- Hey, look, it's a break.
- I'm just saying.

253
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,259
- It's a break, Kunle.
- I'm just saying.

254
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:11,468
Spring break. "Break."

255
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,844
That's what it means, all right?

256
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,555
I got like three weeks
till it's due anyway, so...

257
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,641
I'm good.

258
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,143
KUNLE:
Okay, but...

259
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:23,021
Yeah, I'm doing it.
No, I'm saying it. Look.

260
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:24,690
Three weeks is nothing.

261
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,817
If we can't get into all seven parties,

262
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,443
it's not the end of the world,

263
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:29,837
but it will be the end of the world

264
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,196
if you do not graduate.

265
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,990
Okay, do not downplay what the fuck

266
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,533
we doing tonight, all right?

267
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,076
We are making history.

268
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,012
- Get your priorities straight, Kunle.
- (cell phone chimes) -My pri...

269
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,764
- Okay. All right, all right.
- Get your priorities straight.

270
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,456
All right.

271
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,293
What is this?

272
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,753
(groans)

273
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,422
Oh, Jesus.

274
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,549
- Wh-What is this?
- It's death punch.

275
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,135
We got to get a buzz, bitch.
We on a schedule, all right?

276
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,095
I'm gonna be back.
Hurry up with all this shit.

277
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,596
And finish that little bottle.

278
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,765
- "Little bottle"?
- Finish it!

279
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,310
There's, like, a whole lot in here.

280
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,689
I am not drinking that.

281
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,359
(muttering quietly)

282
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,111
LEO:
Here you are, bruh.

283
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,322
Yes, yes. Thank you.
I really fucking owe you one.

284
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:15,466
Yeah, yeah, of course you do.
You actually got lucky.

285
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,302
I was about to give those
to a cute freshman chick.

286
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:18,744
Oh, my bad.

287
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,805
Bruh, we were getting attached,
and then she want to say,

288
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,247
"Oh, look, I got a boyfriend."

289
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,874
And it's just, are you serious?

290
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,935
Like, I'm getting emotional.
I'm an emotional person.

291
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,519
But, I mean, I don't care at this point

292
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,629
because I can just do my own thing

293
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,274
until, you know, she's done with her man,

294
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,984
- SEAN: Mm-hmm. Word, word.
- LEO: but your future ex.

295
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,736
- All right, I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah, yeah, but...

296
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,362
- Yeah, so... Yeah. (stammers)
- Thank you again.

297
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,721
SEAN:
Hey, Asa. Asa, hey.

298
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,182
Wait, where you gonna be tonight?

299
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,434
- Equinox and Underground.
- Yeah?

300
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,102
Okay, well, me and Kunle, too.

301
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,563
We're finally gonna finish
our Legendary Tour, thanks.

302
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,357
- Mm, for real?
- Mm-hmm.

303
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,817
Sounds intense and possibly ill-advised.

304
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,111
Well, "intense and possibly ill-advised"

305
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:56,740
is the tag line for our night,
so that works for me.

306
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,160
Well, as your friend, I just
want to say for the record

307
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,204
maybe you should take it easy.

308
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,333
I can't, because
we're making history, but...

309
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,418
No, I'm serious, though.

310
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,229
(mutters, chuckles) You don't...
You didn't have to do all that.

311
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,933
Look, you're gonna do
what you're gonna do.

312
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,299
Just don't be dragging Kunle
into some bullshit.

313
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,301
That boy is Black excellence,

314
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,428
and there's still hope for him.

315
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,723
Bye, Sean.

316
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,396
MAMA:
<i>Your anti sent you a package.</i>

317
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,647
<i>Did you get it?</i>

318
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,358
KUNLE: Oh, oh, I, uh...
I-I haven't been home yet.

319
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,628
MAMA (over phone):
Remember to call her and say thank you.

320
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:36,154
I told her you got into Princeton

321
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,198
and you'll be doing your PhD there.

322
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,259
Now she is telling everyone
you're going to be a doctor.

323
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,994
(laughs)
I didn't have the heart to tell her

324
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:46,164
- it's not that kind of doctor.
- Ah. (chuckles)

325
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:50,001
Well, uh, technically,
I still will be a doctor,

326
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,711
just not of medicine.

327
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,713
It's not too late to go to med school.

328
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,900
- Mama. Mama.
- You would be a wonderful cardiologist.

329
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,110
- (door bangs open)
- SEAN: Boom, bitch!

330
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,886
(laughs loudly, grunts)

331
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,764
- You ready to fucking party?
- (door bangs shut)

332
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:03,765
- MAMA: Party?
- Oh.

333
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,308
Kunle, what party?

334
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,661
- Oh, shit.
- KUNLE: No, it's not a party.

335
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,603
No, it's not a party. It's just Sean and I

336
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:10,207
hanging out with some friends tonight.

337
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:11,815
MAMA:
Why are you going to a party?

00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,393
- So I'm gonna hide his weed...
- Sean. Sean.

509
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,019
What?

510
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,360
SEAN:
The fuck?

511
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,070
KUNLE:
Okay, um...

512
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,823
Okay.

513
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,242
Hello? Hello.

514
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:23,246
Hey, yo, wake up!

515
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,957
- Hey! Wake up!
- (clapping)

516
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,625
- KUNLE: Okay, okay.
- What the fuck?

517
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,294
Um...

518
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,421
(sighs)

519
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,047
No, hey! Don't touch her.

520
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:35,884
This could possibly be a crime scene.

521
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,594
Well, we need... Uh, w-w...

522
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,471
KUNLE:
Okay. Okay, she's-she's alive.

523
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:41,848
- She's breathing.
- (exhales)

524
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:45,518
Her-her pulse is fast,
but her breathing is slow.

525
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,606
- Okay, okay, okay.
- (Kunle exhales)

526
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:51,733
All right. Um...

527
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:52,901
Okay.

528
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,779
KUNLE: We should call...
we should call 911.

529
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,907
Carlos.

530
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,659
Kunle.

531
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,912
Kunle, I'm too high for this shit.

532
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,371
What if he's dead, bro?

533
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:08,458
- He's not dead. He's not dead.
- All right. Okay.

534
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,667
Go look.

535
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,377
Go see. Go check. Go do whatever.

536
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,837
- Okay. Come on.
- (pats arm)

537
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:14,881
Me and you, me and you,
me and you, me and you.

538
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,342
I'm-I'm right behind you.
Right behind you.

539
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:25,642
- You're right behind me?
- Motherfucker, just go!

540
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,518
Los?

541
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:39,197
(creaking)

542
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,826
(sighs):
Okay.

543
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,453
Hey.

544
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:46,788
Carlos?

545
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,706
(coughing)

546
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,084
- Hey. Hey, hey.
- (whoops, grunts)

547
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,585
(laughing):
Jesus.

548
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,003
- You got me.
- Right.

549
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,731
I'm-I'm presently at war with the Russians

550
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,007
and the Persian Empire,
so shit is about to get… -Okay.

551
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,218
Okay, but do you know the girl out here?

552
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,345
Hold on a second. Wait.

553
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,596
Look.

554
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,932
- Hey, hey.
- This is a single-player game.

555
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,767
- You can pause.
- Mess up my sensitivity.

556
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,519
Now, there's a girl on...

557
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,397
Ah, girl problems, huh?

558
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,357
What, is it Bianca? Is it someone I know?

559
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,150
What-what's going on?

560
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:17,944
Ew.

561
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,279
There is an unconscious
white girl in our living room.

562
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,950
(laughs, burps)

563
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,201
What?

564
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,924
- SEAN: Hey, hey, Kunle!
- (girl retching)

565
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:28,454
Kunle, Kunle, she's throwing up!

566
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:29,956
Oh, hey, hey, Kunle!

567
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,499
Kunle, she erupting.

568
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,251
She throwing, bro. She throwing up.

569
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,795
(all groaning)

570
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:36,963
Who-who is she?

571
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,007
KUNLE:
We-we don't know.

572
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,383
(slurring):
Where's Maddy?

573
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,760
Hey. Hey, hey. What'd you say?

574
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:44,804
What-what... what did you say?

575
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,407
Can you go tell her I feel really weird?

576
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:47,866
Ooh, no, no. Come on, come on, come on.

577
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,058
SEAN:
Hey, stop touching.

578
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,144
- Stop touching.
- No, I cannot stop touching.

579
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,812
Look, we have to keep her on her side.

580
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,189
All right? Or else she could
inhale vomit and die.

581
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:57,817
Look, just trust me.
I'm first aid certified.

582
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,402
That's... Okay.

583
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,696
Hey, what's your name?

584
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,322
What's your...

585
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,617
Okay. All right, um...

586
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,454
We should call 911, right?

587
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,205
- Yes...
- No, no. Hey, stop. -Yes.

588
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,124
- What? What?
- Stop. Are you fucking crazy?

589
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:14,625
Do you not know what they'll think

590
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:15,877
when they come and see this?

591
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,462
They're gonna shoot us and arrest us

592
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:18,856
for killing this little white girl.

593
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,840
Shoot us and arrest us?

594
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,383
- Yes.
- Come on, man.

595
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:24,611
- We didn't do anything wrong.
- Hey, hey, stop, stop, stop.

596
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,679
- (groaning)
- Okay, listen.

597
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:27,889
What the fuck are you...

598
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,932
We don't have to do nothing wrong, Kunle.

599
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,268
Just be in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

600
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,519
Which we are!

601
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:34,812
Down white girl.

602
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:36,522
House that reeks of weed.

603
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:40,026
Your fingerprints and DNA
are all over her, Touchy Tim.

604
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,962
And, Carlos, you were here
the whole fucking time.

605
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,321
What's your alibi, huh?

606
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,906
Uh...

607
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,867
Guys, we're just gonna tell 'em
we came home...

608
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,678
- Kunle. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- She was on the floor.

609
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,370
They not gonna listen, all right?

610
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,640
The cops don't know that you're
basically white on the inside.

611
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,142
- Don't start that right now...
- What? I'm being honest.

612
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,019
Bitch, that's honest information.
Don't get mad.

613
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,669
They're not gonna listen.

614
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,647
They're just gonna come in here
and see three Brown guys

615
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,757
hanging over this little white girl.

616
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,801
Do y'all not see how fucked that is?

617
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:10,306
♪ ♪

618
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,493
CARLOS:
Perhaps we could persuade a friend

619
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,870
to call 911 for us.

620
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:37,708
Someone a-a little less, um... you know.

621
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,293
What, Brown?

622
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:40,711
So a white person.

623
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:43,840
A female would be preferable.

624
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:47,677
Um, we could... we could call Bianca.

625
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,680
I mean, she cool,
but she don't know all of us that well.

626
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,014
Okay, who knows us?

627
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,975
Um... Asa.

628
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:57,979
I would rather not put my life
in the hands of my ex.

629
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,731
Plus, she a Black queen.
We need a white girl.

630
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:02,608
Um... (stammers, chuckles)

631
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,277
It's funny, I-I-I...

632
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,737
I don't know too many
of my white female peers.

633
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:08,281
It's troubling.

634
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:09,991
Um...

635
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,534
Oh, oh, we-we could call

636
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,703
- White Sean, the football player.
- Ooh...

637
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,472
Football players never get
in trouble, right?

638
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:18,040
White Sean, White Sean.
Ooh, come on, White Sean.

639
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,877
- (line ringing)
- Come on.

640
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,354
WHITE SEAN (over phone):
Oh, what's up, Sean?

641
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,921
Hey, hey, White Sean.

642
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:26,090
- Where are you?
- Uh, I'm actually on

643
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:28,509
a microbrewery tour with my mom.

644
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:30,887
- So you're not on campus?
- Nah.

645
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,031
- Fuck.
- You know, you know, man, I didn't think I'd like this...

646
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,808
Um, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, got to go.

647
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:38,769
Okay, who else can we call?
Come on, come on, come on.

648
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:40,563
Brian Phan?

649
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:41,856
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

650
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:43,819
Asians... they, like,
fucking neutral to police.

651
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,153
No. Brian is in Cabo for break.

652
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:49,006
SEAN: Oh, fuck, y'all,
we are one percent of the school.

653
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,324
How the fuck don't we know
any white people?

654
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,910
Maybe we just over thinking right now.

655
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,916
Hey. Hey, yo!

656
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,209
Yeah, there she go.

657
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:04,712
Hey. You got anybody
that you want us to call?

658
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:07,340
- Or, like, a-a friend or a phone or something?
- (moans softly)

659
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,258
KUNLE:
She cannot be on her back.

660
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:10,777
- Okay, okay, all right, all right.
- SEAN: The touching.

661
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,641
- It's the touching.
- KUNLE: Come on, come on.

662
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,072
Okay, so what do we know? What do we know?
What do we know?

663
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:17,433
This girl got drunk
and came here on accident.

664
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,935
Like Goldilocks.

665
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,853
And we're the three bears.

666
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,397
KUNLE:
Please don't. Please don't.

667
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:25,608
Let's... leave it alone. Leave it alone.

668
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,777
Don't-don't...

669
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,630
SEAN:
All right, and look at what she's wearing.

670
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:30,988
Anything but clothes.

671
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:32,907
She was at Omicron.

672
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,785
We could just take her ass back.

673
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,328
KUNLE:
And do what?

674
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,081
What, just-just walk in with her?

675
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:41,415
No, not walk in with her.

676
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:43,739
Lay her outside where somebody
can find her and help her.

677
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:46,837
Your plan is to dump the unconscious girl

678
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:49,257
outside of the frat party?

679
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,508
Yeah.

680
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:56,389
No, no. No, you right.

681
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,533
- Nah. It's not...
- Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

682
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,911
- Somebody... Yeah, somebody... People could see us.
- Yeah.

683
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:02,395
Draw conclusions, all that bad shit.

684
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:03,854
CARLOS:
Drunk people, lots of eyes.

685
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:06,148
- SEAN: Yeah.
- CARLOS: That's difficult.

686
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:09,944
Also, fellas, she's fucking unconscious.

687
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,445
We can't just leave her somewhere.

688
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:13,173
- Right? Right?
- SEAN: Okay. Okay. Okay. -CARLOS: Right.

689
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,877
KUNLE:
What the fuck is wrong with you two?

690
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,033
What, you got a better idea?

691
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:18,369
Yes. We call 911.

692
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,204
Or we could just let her sleep it off.

693
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,789
Okay? I've been this drunk before.

694
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,767
- Y'all know that shit.
- Yeah. He always wakes up.

695
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,686
SEAN: Come on,
you know I've been this drunk before.

696
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,295
We don't even know if she's drunk.

697
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:29,088
What if she's, like, roofied?

698
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,092
Why'd you have to come here, huh?

699
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,802
Why'd you have to come here?

700
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:36,679
CARLOS:
'Cause it was just right.

701

It's not hot, it's not too cold.

703
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,601
Sorry. I'm sorry.

704

I mean, this not our problem.

707
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:48,524
This is our problem.

708
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,109
She is already in our house.

709
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,170
- Yeah, because you don't know how to lock the door, Carlos.
- What?

710
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,506
- We've talked about this shit.
- Okay. All right, all right, look, look.

711
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,050
Why wouldn't you just let me call 911?

712

Now w-we've waited too long,

713
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,927
it's gonna look weird
that we haven't called.

714
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,013
Well, then it's a good thing
that we're not calling, Kunle.

715
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:02,330

You should've just left it there.

726
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,889

- SEAN: Kunle, Kunle, look.

728
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:23,744

- I'm calling 911.

- Sean, Sean.
- Do not... Shut up. Shut up.

730

- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

- Make me. Shut up.

- Get off of me.
- No.

733
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,402
- Put the phone down, Kunle.
- Los?

734
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:35,279
SEAN:
Lower the phone.

735
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:38,324
What if... what if...

736
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,409
we take her to the hospital?

737
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:44,538
All right? Just say that we found her.

738
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:45,790
It's the truth.

739
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,059
That's actually not a bad idea.

that we'll have enough time
to make it to Blackout.

- No, no. Maddy.

Or just around Sean, please.

1016
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,343
Wait, I mean, you mean you haven't
already told him?

1017
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:24,696
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- I mean,

1018
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,155
he-he thinks you're
living together next year.

1019
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:27,824
Okay, okay, well, maybe
he shouldn't just assume that.

1020
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:31,852
Yeah, yeah, but it's rather uncouth
to just let him go and keep assuming.

1021
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:37,107
KUNLE (muffled):
No, you're right, you're right.

1022
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,192
(conversation continues indistinctly)

1023
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,949
(dog barking in distance)

1024
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,831
(TV plays indistinctly)

1025
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:05,510
- (Emma whoops, laughs)
- KUNLE: Whoo. Yeah, you did it. Whoo, yes.

1026
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:08,638
- (whooping)
- Whoa. Whoo.

1027
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:10,522
- KUNLE: Come on.
- Can y'all please hurry up?

1028
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:12,768
- This fucking lady watching us.
- CARLOS: What lady?

1029
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:17,397
KUNLE:
Hmm-mm.

1030
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:18,607
Get up.

1031
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,150
- I'm driving.
- What?

1032
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:22,861
You're paranoid... because you're high.

1033
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,988
Which is exactly why
you shouldn't be driving.

1034
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:27,949
Okay. Whatever. Okay.

1035
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,719
SEAN:
I ain't gonna worry about anything, am I?

1036
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:31,369
SEAN (deep voice):
Yeah.

1037
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:33,330
(door alarm dinging)

1038
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:34,581
(door closes)

1039
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:37,125
Hey, um, the taillight's busted.

1040
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:38,710
SEAN:
What?

1041
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,963
(long exhale)

1042
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:44,174
- SEAN: We gonna die.
- KUNLE: No, we are...

1043
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:45,509
- No. What?
- We gonna die, bro.

1044
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,153
- Hey. No, no, no, no.
- Oh, we gonna die tonight.

1045
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:48,696
Don't do this. Don't do this.
Please don't do this right...

1046
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,822
We gonna die. We gonna die, Kunle.

1047
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:51,157
We get pulled over, we die, Kunle.

1048
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:53,058
- Look...
- We call the police, we die, Kunle.

1049
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,869
- Okay, look, Sean, Sean, Sean.
- We breathe the wrong way,

1050
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,204
- we die, Kunle.
- Okay, look, Sean.

1051
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:58,605
This isn't good,
but panicking does not help.

1052
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:01,358
Calm down. Look, hey, man,
look at me. Look at me.

1053
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,693
- Okay.
- Think about it statistically.

1054
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:05,821
How many people actually
get shot by the cops?

1055
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:08,657
It's, like, really,
really unlikely, right?

1056
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,575
- A lot, Kunle.
- No, no, no.

1057
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:12,637
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- No, no, no, no, no.

1058
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:14,204
No, it's really, really unlikely.

1059
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,516
I mean, do you know anyone
who's actually been shot by the police?

1060
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,542
- I don't know anybody. -CARLOS: No.
- SEAN: Yes.

1061
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:19,835
My cousin.

1062
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,628
Geez, man. I'm sorry.

1063
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,505
- Yeah, I'm sorry. I didn't...
- Is he...?

1064
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,566
He wasn't doing anything...
Just minding his business,

1065
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,509
hanging with a friend,
playing <i>Call of Duty.</i>

1066
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,428
And they just showed up
for-for... for no reason?

1067
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:33,306
Well, his friend was trapping
a little bit.

1068
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,076
- His friend was trapping a little bit.
- God.

1069
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,810
(stammers) The cops came in,

1070
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,562
kicked the gor... door down.

1071
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:42,357
I mean, they say he scared 'em,
and they shot him, all right?

1072
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,776
Shot him right in his ass, man.

1073
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,362
(chuckles)

1074
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,905
(Kunle and Carlos laughing)

1075
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,493
(laughter continues)

1076
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:55,954
SEAN: Oh, you motherfuckers
are some assholes.

1077
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,165
That's not funny.

1078
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:00,250
He got to wear a colostomy bag now.

1079
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:03,837
- Oh.
- You ever boo-boo in a bag?

1080
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,505
- (Kunle chuckles)
- No.

1081
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:07,275
He might've did some fucked-up shit,
but that don't mean

1082
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:08,693
that he deserved that.
Like, come on, y'all.

1083
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:10,093
-KUNLE: Okay, no, he didn't,
-Guys.

1084
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:12,137
- But what do you want to do?
- Guys.

1085
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,680
Incoming.

1086
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,682
MAN: Hey, we can see
what you're doing out here,

1087
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:17,368
and we don't tolerate that
in this neighborhood.

1088
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:18,560
We saw you.

1089
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,020
MAN:
You need to get out of here.

1090
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:21,873
WOMAN:
And you don't need to be selling drugs.

1091
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:24,041
- SEAN: We're leaving. -Get out.
- KUNLE: Look, look, look.

1092
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,585
- We're-we're not doing anything wrong.
- Please get your phone out of my face.

1093
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:27,378
- We just had some car issues.
- MAN: I said get out.

1094
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,842

1096
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,365

- MAN: Yeah, let 'em go.

1097
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,119

- MAN: Come on.

1098
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:38,663

- MAN: Yeah.

ALICE (voice-over):
<i>Her pin's moving again.</i>

1100
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:48,673
It looks like she's in that car.

1101
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:54,137
KUNLE: She seriously thought
we were drug dealers.

1102
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:56,056
What if she called the cops?

1103
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:58,299
What if we get pulled over?
What if we get pulled over?

1104
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,684
What if we get pulled over?

1105
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:01,937
Sean, what do we do?

1106
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,773
Look, Terence got an extra car
that we can use, okay?

1107
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:07,192
He live around the corner. It's not far.

1108
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,236
Are you sure there's just not just, like,

1109
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:10,904
one other, like... maybe your aunt.

1110
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,114
We can go to your aunt's house.

1111
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:15,200
Just make this left up here. Don't be...

1112
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,244
Don't be fucking nervous.

1113
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:21,957
He's the closest?

1114
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:33,551
(turns off engine)

1115
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:36,054
No, no, no. Hey, hey.
You stay here with her.

What are you doing here?

1128
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:11,881
I need to see my brother.

1129
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:14,467
- Uh, he's up in here somewhere.
- Yeah.

1130
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:16,671
- MALIK: Hey, who's your friend?

Hey, I'ma be back. Try to go find Terence.

1137
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:32,193
So, Baby Sean's friend from school?

1138
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:35,071
Yes, yes, we're, uh, we're roommates.

1139

Hell yeah.

00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:05,370
(unzips bag, rummages)

1180
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:07,330
- Want some granola?
- No.

1181
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:09,916
No? Okay, that's-that's fine.

1182
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:13,044
Um, uh, what's your major?

1183
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:16,673
I'm a mechanical aerospace engineer,

1184
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:20,051
aka, uh, um, a rocket scientist.

1185
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:21,553
You know, the-the...

1186
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,097
Serious. Hey.

1187
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,391
Hey, hey, hey.

1188
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:27,851
Stay awake.

1189
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:29,894
(both chuckle)

1190
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:32,188
You like, uh... you like outer space?

1191
00:45:32,272 --> 00:45:34,315
Rockets? (makes whooshing sound)

1192
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:37,318
Stuff like that? (chuckles)

1193
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:42,282
It's always been a-a dream of mine
to go to Mars someday.

1194
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:44,367
Would you like to go to Mars?

1195
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:48,913
Emma?

1196
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:52,125
Emma, um...

1197
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:54,669
what year are you?

1198
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,297
In school... what-what year are you?

1199
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:01,050
(slurs):
Twelfth-th...

1200
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:04,762
Tw-Twelfth.

1201
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,059
Twelfth?

1202
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:13,438
Wait, y-you... y-you mean like...

1203
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:16,441
like you're in high school?

1204
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:21,529
Uh-oh, shh.

1205
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:23,531
Shh.

1206
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:27,744
My sister, she told me not to say.

1207
00:46:30,205 --> 00:46:32,707
She hates me.

1208
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:35,502
- She…
- CARLOS: No, no, no.

1209
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:37,754
(sobbing): She doesn't want
to hang out with me.

1210
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:39,380
No, no, it's all right.

1211
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:43,760
- It's all right. Uh...
- She hates me.

1212
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:45,929
Hey, hey. No, no, no, no, no, no.

1213
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,222
She doesn't hate you.

1214
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:49,015
(chuckling):
She likes you.

1215
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:51,434
She told me.

1216
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:55,146
- Sh-She did?
- Yeah.

1217
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:57,315
Yeah, she told me. Isn't that...

1218
00:46:57,398 --> 00:47:00,109
(both laughing)

1219
00:47:00,193 --> 00:47:01,986
It's-it's all right, okay?

1220
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,905
It's all... it's all good.

1221
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:11,496
(slurring):
I mean, she doesn't really...

1222
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,957
take me anywhere, ever.

1223
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,751
But it's fine.

1224
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,920
We'll grow out of it,

1225
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:23,049
'cause, like, sisters are forever,
you know?

I'm sorry.

Man, was you, like,
hiding in the bathroom?

No.

No.

SEAN:
Yo, what are you doing out of the van?

1243
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:14,851
Get back outside.

- Oh.

SEAN:
Oh, shit, that is...

1246
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:21,608
- Death punch.
- CARLOS: Death punch?

1247

- Why is it called death punch?
- (muffled gagging)

Oh, uh, okay, so-so-so...

1255

we found this girl,
and we don't know who she is.

Actually, actually, her name's Emma,

1257

- MAN: Shit!

- That's shit right there.
- Come on.

1265
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,688
She not gonna get me hung.

1266

KUNLE:
Here. Oh, God. Okay.

1267
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:05,818
So y'all found a passed-out,

1268
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:09,864
possibly roofied white child
in your house,

1269
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,741
got her even drunker,

1270
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:14,619
and you thought it'd be a good idea
to bring her to my house?

1271
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:18,623
Sean, you know I'm on parole,
and you lied to me.

1272
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:22,085
Kunle, is your grandma even dying?

1273
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:27,048
SEAN:
I'm sorry. We just tried to help her.

1274
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,341
Give me my keys.

1275
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:30,843
Give 'em to me!

1276
00:49:30,927 --> 00:49:32,404
SEAN:
We got to actually go to the hospital.

1277
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:33,906
- Man, Kunle…
- TERENCE: Not in my car, you don't.

1278
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:35,473
- Here. Just take 'em.
- SEAN: Yo, ey.

1279
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:38,017
- What you doing?
- Look, we don't have time to argue, Sean.

1280
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:40,311
We got to go now. Come on, Carlos.

1281
00:49:40,395 --> 00:49:41,729
TERENCE:
You can't go with them.

1282
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:43,731
Have you lost your damn mind?

1283
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:46,317
If something happens to that girl,
they'll be fine.

1284
00:49:46,401 --> 00:49:48,903
Even if they get caught,
they'll be fine probably.

1285
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,863
You won't be.

1286
00:49:50,947 --> 00:49:52,073
Isn't Kunle rich?

1287

CARLOS:
On it.

1348
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:12,713
Yeah, I think that was
the license plate. I don't...

1349
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:14,477
911 DISPATCHER:
So your sister got in a car

1350
00:52:14,507 --> 00:52:16,827
with three Black or Latino men
that you didn't recognize...

1351
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:19,011
What do you... what do you mean?
What do you mean?

1352
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:22,139
You said one of them opened the door
and she climbed in the car.

1353
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:24,023
Do you have reason to believe
she was coerced?

1354
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:25,285
MADDY:
Are you fucking kidding me?

1355
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:27,770
Why... why would she get in a random car

1356
00:52:27,854 --> 00:52:30,064
with three fucking guys
that she doesn't even know?

1357
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:33,693
- She's 17.
- Ma'am, I'm just trying to understand your emergency.

1358
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:35,587
Oh, uh, actually,
it feels like you're trying to say

1359
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:37,655
that I'm racist or something,
and I'm really not,

1360
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:39,675
- so I don't really know what you're trying to do.
- Maddy...

1361
00:52:39,699 --> 00:52:41,033
My sister needs help.

1362
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:42,535
Are you intoxicated, ma'am?

1363
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:44,763
How does that... How does...
Wait, how does that matter?

1364
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:46,265
- How does that even matter?
- Okay, Maddy, give me the...

1365
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:48,624
- I saw what I saw!
- Maddy. Hi. I'm so sorry.

1366
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:50,894
-My-my friend is just a little bit upset
-Give me the phone. Give me it. (grunts)

1367
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,920
- Because it's her sister.
- DISPATCHER: Uh-huh.

1368
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:55,339
Is there any way we could do,
like, a welfare check?

1369
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,842
We're tracking her phone,
so we have her current location.

1370
00:52:57,925 --> 00:53:00,612
DISPATCHER: Sure. We'll send our
next available officer to check it out.

1371
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:02,356

This thing really isn't that hard to ride.

1441
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:23,315

- Why aren't they moving?

- Yeah.

You could, I don't know,

1451
00:56:39,772 --> 00:56:41,083
- be grateful.
- Rafael, it's all right.

- And you're cool.

- And you deserve better than this.

- I'm just saying.

You don't even fucking know me.

1460

you could just not be actively mean.

- I'm sorry! I'm having a hard night!
- We're here, all right?

1463
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:02,336
And we're here for you, Maddy.

1464
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,712
We're fucking here.

1465
00:57:03,796 --> 00:57:05,756
You brought a high schooler
to a fraternity party

1466
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,234
and then neglected her for two hours.

1467
00:57:07,258 --> 00:57:08,425
We're fucking here.

1468
00:57:08,509 --> 00:57:10,229
So get on the goddamn bike,
and we're going.

00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:15,242
RAFAEL:
I think you should get on the bike.

1477
00:57:33,284 --> 00:57:35,119
she backtracked.

1478
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:37,329
Or-or maybe...

1479
00:57:37,413 --> 00:57:39,415
No offense... you're in no way qualified

1480
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:40,875
to track people through the woods.

1481
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,334
- I'm an Eagle Scout.
- Okay.

1482
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:43,919
I was trained in tracking animals.

1483
00:57:44,003 --> 00:57:45,713
Okay, but this isn't Boy Scouts,
all right?

1484
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:48,549
- It's not...
- This isn't a video game. This is real life.

1485
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:52,887
And we... we can't just reload
if you're wrong, Carlos.

1486
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,364
And I'm sorry, but I don't see anything.

1487
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:55,639
Do you see anything?

1488
00:57:55,723 --> 00:57:57,892
Sean, you see anything?
Uh, no, there's nothing.

1489
00:57:57,975 --> 00:57:59,351
All right, I'm...

1490

- What if she dies out here?

1492
00:58:03,606 --> 00:58:05,649
Huh? Why did I listen to you?

1493
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:07,943
This is so fucking stupid.

1494
00:58:08,027 --> 00:58:09,570
This is so stupid.

1495
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:11,614
I told you we should just call 911,

1496
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:12,865
but you wouldn't let me.

1497
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:14,491
You just wouldn't let me call.

1498
00:58:14,575 --> 00:58:15,826
Now look at us.

1499
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:17,411
Wouldn't let you call?

1500
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,663
What the fuck am I,
your third-grade teacher?

1501
00:58:19,747 --> 00:58:21,248
You decided not to call.

1502
00:58:21,332 --> 00:58:23,500
We all decided to not call.

1503
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:27,213
He didn't force you not to call.

1504
00:58:27,296 --> 00:58:28,380
Seriously?

1505
00:58:28,464 --> 00:58:30,024
SEAN:
If you called, it would be on you,

1506
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,760
and you didn't want it to be on you
because you knew I was right.

1507
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:34,178
Also because you're a pussy.

1508
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:35,763
- What?
- KUNLE: I'm-I'm a pussy?

1509
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:38,015
- Yeah.
- I'm a pussy, but you've been afraid

1510
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:40,160
- of everything this whole night?
- CARLOS (clears throat): Guys, guys.

1511
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:41,953
- I'm a pussy?
- Can we not call each other pussies?

1512
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:43,646
It's kind of sexist.

1513
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:45,981
A vagina is strong enough
to give birth to a child.

1514
00:58:46,065 --> 00:58:48,359
I mean, I think the word
that you're looking for

1515
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:50,903
is-is "coward" or-or, ironically enough,

1516
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:52,529
- "wiener."
- KUNLE: Yeah.

1517
00:58:52,613 --> 00:58:56,116
Mm-hmm. Don't be such a sexist
coward wiener, Sean.

1518
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,868
SEAN:
I can't believe you just said that

1519
00:58:57,952 --> 00:59:00,013
- out your mouth, first of all.
- Yeah. Sexist coward wiener.

1520
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:02,265
- You, all of that.
- Okay, well, don't be such a little bitch, Kunle.

1521
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:03,332
- I'm a bitch?
- Yeah.

1522
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:04,768
- That's also arguably sexist.
- Okay. -Yeah.

1523
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:05,793
Calm down.

1524
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:07,229
- If you got something to say, just say it.
- Look, okay.

1525
00:59:07,253 --> 00:59:11,131
You were around real Black men
for like two fucking minutes tonight,

1526
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:12,651
and you went and hid in the bathroom.

1527
00:59:12,675 --> 00:59:14,677
- Who was hiding? I was hiding?
- You! It's okay.

1528
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,655
- I wasn't hiding. I wasn't hiding.
- I love you still.

1529
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:18,281
- SEAN: Oh, wow.
- Okay, all right, no, we can do this.

1530
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:19,741
What the fuck do you want me to say?

1531
00:59:19,765 --> 00:59:22,101
What, I'm so sorry
that my parents are doctors?

1532
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:24,270
Oh, shit, you know what?
I'm even more sorry

1533
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:26,272
- that my childhood was happy.
- (sneezes) Ow.

1534
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:27,898
You know what?

1535
00:59:27,982 --> 00:59:31,026
You don't have the authority
to revoke my Blackness, dickhead.

1536
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,587
Guys, can we... can we please just...

1537
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:34,113
No, no, no. Let him continue.

1538
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:35,796
- Kunle angry.
- (laughs): You know what?

1539
00:59:35,823 --> 00:59:39,660
I think it is hilarious
that you think that you are so wise.

1540
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:42,496
Like you got some kind of street smarts.
Why?

1541
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,915
Oh, why, Sean?
Because you know where to buy acid?

1542
00:59:44,999 --> 00:59:46,834
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, Carlos.

1543
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:48,752
Guess what.
This dude's tried drugs before.

1544
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:50,504
- I know.
- KUNLE: Whoo, yeah!

1545
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:51,867
Round of applause, motherfucker.

1546
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:53,173
You tried drugs.

1547
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:54,341
But you know what?

1548
00:59:54,425 --> 00:59:55,843
Who the fuck cares?

1549
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:57,678
You know what, Sean?

1550
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:59,930
The last time I checked,
getting fucked-up all the time

1551
01:00:00,014 --> 01:00:01,932
doesn't mean you know a goddamn thing.

1552
01:00:02,016 --> 01:00:03,642
It just makes you fucked-up.

1553
01:00:07,146 --> 01:00:08,897
SEAN (sputters, laughing):
Okay.

1554
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:14,411
- I like this Kunle.
- Yeah, I'm glad you do.

1555
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:15,946
This Kunle is nice.

1556
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:17,882
- That's good. You showing nuts now.
- Fuck this.

1557
01:00:17,906 --> 01:00:19,867
Look, I feel like it's the first time
he ever used

1558
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,303
his Black skin tone type of thing.

1559
01:00:21,327 --> 01:00:22,929
- This is great. I like this.
- KUNLE: You know what?

1560
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:24,389
SEAN:
Nah, I'm sorry, that was just really good.

1561
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:25,682
Look, just chill out, all right?
Chill out.

1562
01:00:25,706 --> 01:00:27,017
- No, I'm gonna... I'm call...
- Give me the fucking phone.

1563
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:28,625
KUNLE:
Carlos, give me your phone.

1564
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:31,003
- Give me your phone.
- Just chill out, Carlos.

1565
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:32,880
- Give it to me now!
- Come on.

1566
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:34,649
- Don't give him your phone.
- Give it to me, Carlos.

1567
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:35,799
Don't... Calm down.

1568
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:37,319
We don't got time for this, Kunle.
Chill out.

1569
01:00:37,343 --> 01:00:39,261
- No, we lost her!
- The girl, we... Ooh.

1570
01:00:39,345 --> 01:00:42,431
We lost this girl in the fucking forest
because of you!

1571
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:43,515
You!

1572
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,810
- Fuck!
- (quietly): Ouch. Nice.

1573
01:00:46,894 --> 01:00:48,788
- Give me this fucking...
- Hey, hey. -Get your ass...

1574
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:50,230
- (groans)
- SEAN: See?

1575
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:51,416
- KUNLE: Fuck! -SEAN: Kunle.
- Guys, guys.

1576
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:52,792
- Can we please stop fighting?
- Asshole!

1577
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:55,027
It doesn't accomplish anything.

1578
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:57,071
- Come on.
- SEAN: All right, look.

1579
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:59,090
Let's take it to a vote
since this dickhead right here

1580
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:01,617
- wants to go all at. Right?
- (sneezes) Ow.

1581
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:05,579
All in favor of calling the police,
raise your hand.

1582
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:08,791
KUNLE:
Yeah, how you feel?

1583
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:10,584
I feel so good.

1584
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,669
I feel really good, Kunle.

1585
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:22,888
Yeah, you're both cowards.

1586
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:25,516
SEAN (whispers):
We're both cowards.

1587
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,601
Get off of me, Carlos!

1588
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,395
SEAN:
Don't be mad at him.

1589
01:01:29,478 --> 01:01:32,022
(Emma coughing nearby)

1590
01:01:32,106 --> 01:01:34,108
(coughing continues)

1591
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:42,866
Found her.

1592
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:46,078
How the fuck she get in a tree?

1593
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:52,251
CARLOS: Someday this will all just be
a crazy story, you know?

1594
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:56,296
Remember when we tried
to sneak into Underground?

1595
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,132
Freshman year.

1596
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:00,843
(Carlos chuckles)

1597
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,404
SEAN:
Yeah, and you got stuck in the window

1598
01:02:02,428 --> 01:02:04,197
- like fucking Winnie-the-Pooh.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1599
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:05,806
That's what you said back then.

1600
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:08,308
And-and, um,
then we went back to your room,

1601
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:13,564
and we just watched 1970s Winnie-the-Pooh
compilation videos on YouTube.

1602
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:20,154
You know, I-I feel like that's the night
that we became friends.

1603
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:23,699
Like, this is kind of our friend-versary.

1604
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:25,701
We've come full circle.

1605
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:27,870
So, we all just get to go to Underground.

1606
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:29,371
Finally, right?

1607
01:02:29,455 --> 01:02:30,998
And-and just in time.

1608
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:33,083
Because this is our last chance.

1609
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,546
So you got to come, man.

1610
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:40,132
Don't be a party pooper. Come on.

1611
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:42,509
I'm tired.

1612
01:02:42,593 --> 01:02:44,761
But, y-you know, you should go.

1613
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:49,558
SEAN:
Fuck him. L-Let him be a party pooper.

1614
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:51,685
CARLOS:
Come on, Kunle.

1615
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,645
KUNLE:
I can't go.

1616
01:02:53,729 --> 01:02:55,105
If I go, you can't go.

1617
01:02:55,189 --> 01:02:57,065
Because Sean only got two passes.

1618
01:02:57,149 --> 01:03:00,486
Sean only got passes for himself plus one.

1619
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:03,780
So you should go.

1620
01:03:05,157 --> 01:03:07,159
Bitch-ass shit.

1621
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:10,162
Los, I just didn't think you'd want to go.

1622
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:11,580
That was it.

1623
01:03:11,663 --> 01:03:13,624
No, I-I, um...

1624
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:15,435
For real, I really did think
that you was just

1625
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:17,299
- gonna be playing games tonight, man.
- I was.

1626
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:22,466
I was. Yes, so it's... it's fine.

1627
01:03:23,509 --> 01:03:25,052
Los.

1628
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:27,971
- Los.
- CARLOS: That's...

1629
01:03:28,055 --> 01:03:29,598
That's fine. Yeah.

1630
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:31,433
(chuckles)

1631
01:03:31,517 --> 01:03:33,519
(crickets chirping)

1632
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,653
Whoa, whoa, guys, look.

1633
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:53,956
ALICE:
Come on.

1634
01:04:00,796 --> 01:04:02,339
ALICE (whispers):
Call 911 again.

1635
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:04,484
- RAFAEL: I think we should call 911.
- ALICE: Okay, I'll do it.

1636
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:07,386
DISPATCHER:
911. What is the nature of your emergency?

1637
01:04:07,469 --> 01:04:09,471
- ALICE: Yes, hi. It's us again.
- Oh.

1638
01:04:09,555 --> 01:04:11,306
We called about the girl in the van.

1639
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:14,351
Well, we're, like,
hiding and-and-and looking at them,

1640
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:16,412
and we're pretty sure
that something bad is going on now.

1641
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:18,772
They've brought her
into the middle of the woods.

1642
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,066
She looks unconscious.

1643
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:23,694
(Sean and Kunle speaking indistinctly)

1644
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:24,945
SEAN:
What's wrong with you?

1645
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:26,089
KUNLE:
Okay, don't ask me what's wrong with me.

1646
01:04:26,113 --> 01:04:27,155
What's wrong with you?

1647
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:29,050
- SEAN: I ain't fuck up nobody's moment.
- Okay, well, look, this whole...

("Kill Yourself (Part III) by

Partying should not be your priority.

School is almost over, and
you don't have anything to show for it.

Sean, you are way too smart
to not have a plan.

Where even are we?

Um, we're on, uh, Highland, Highland Road.

I don't feel like listening
to these lectures all the time, man.

Like, damn.
Like, maybe we don't need to live together

01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:13,785
next year, to be honest.

1666
01:05:13,869 --> 01:05:15,495
Hmm.

1667
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:18,957
You know what?

01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:22,294
I think this is a really good time
to tell you that, um,

1669
01:05:22,377 --> 01:05:24,504
I got into Princeton.

1670
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:29,885
So yeah, we're not gonna be
living together next year.

1671
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:34,931
Good job!

1672
01:05:35,015 --> 01:05:38,060
Princeton. Good, good, Kunle.

1673
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:39,478
You did it.

1674
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:41,313
You know what, fuck you and Princeton.

1675
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:42,814
How 'bout them apples?

1676
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:44,274
Yeah, that's really mature.

1677
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:46,193
Oh, your little culture thingies...

1678
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:47,996
- Them bitches might be dead.
- That's nice.

1679
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:49,547
- SEAN: Yeah.
- KUNLE: That's very mature.

1680
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:52,131
- SEAN: Yeah, fuck your kids.

1681
01:05:53,075 --> 01:05:54,326
KUNLE:
Hey. Oh, hey.

1682
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:55,845
- SEAN: Oh, she got a stick.
- KUNLE: Okay, wait.

1683
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:57,680
- Hey, look, I got this. I got this.
- We, look… we gonna... What? Kunle.

1684
01:05:57,704 --> 01:05:59,223
- Don't-don't...
- You're not a fucking leader.

1685
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:00,767
- All right, don't fucking do this. I got this.
- All right.

1686
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:02,167
- You got it.
- Hey.

1687
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,502
- Oh, shit!
- See?

1688
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:05,021
- Ow, ow, ow!
- You got it. See? See, hey...

1689
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:06,564
- ALICE: Oh. Um...
- (Sean and Kunle shouting)

1690
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:08,232
Yeah, they're fighting
with our friend now.

1691
01:06:08,256 --> 01:06:10,342
- What do we do?
- DISPATCHER: Do not engage.

1692
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:12,612
- (over earbuds): ♪ It's not fair ♪
- (Sean, Kunle and Maddy shouting)

1693
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:13,970
♪ I found love... ♪

1694
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:15,222
- Oh, shit.
- Aah! Stop!

1695
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:16,574
- Stop!
- What did you do to her?!

1696
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:18,016
BOTH:
Who?

1697
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,310
- Emma.
- BOTH: Who the fuck is Emma?

1698
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:21,913
- Oh, shit. Gold...
- Oh, oh, Emma, Emma.

1699
01:06:21,937 --> 01:06:23,271
The Gold... Goldilocks.

1700
01:06:23,355 --> 01:06:25,774
We didn't...
Okay, we are friends of-of Emma.

1701
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:27,460
- Like, we just met her, and we...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1702
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:28,628

- KUNLE: Oh, shit!

1703
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:29,837
- Fuck, stop! Stop!
- Stop fucking...

1704
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:30,922
Give-give me this motherfucking stick.

1705
01:06:30,946 --> 01:06:32,864
- (screams) -Give me the...
- KUNLE: Whoa, oh.

1706
01:06:32,948 --> 01:06:34,308
SEAN:
Strong-ass little white girl.

1707
01:06:34,366 --> 01:06:35,926
- SEAN: Are you okay?
- KUNLE: Oh, shit.

1708
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,136
- She's got spray.
- (both stammering)

1709
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,286
Fuck!

1710
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,250
- That's what your... See, karma, karma.
- Oh...

1711
01:06:40,288 --> 01:06:41,432
- KUNLE: Whoa, whoa.
- I know. See? Karma.

1712
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:43,041
- Ow! Shit!
- KUNLE: Whoa. Hey. -Hah!

1713
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:45,168
- Fuck! Ow!
- KUNLE: No, are you... are you okay?

1714
01:06:45,252 --> 01:06:46,795
Are you... Hey, are you okay?

1715
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:48,505
- We didn't do anything.
- Shit.

1716
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:50,608
And then we were trying to make sure
she was okay. That's it.

1717
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:53,343
Hey, hey, look, you need
to rinse your eyes, all right?

1718
01:06:53,427 --> 01:06:56,096
(groaning) -You really need
to rinse your eyes. Come on.

1719
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:57,407
- Hey, hey, hey.
- ALICE (deep voice): Step back!

1720
01:06:57,431 --> 01:06:59,057
- Oh, fuck.
- That's right!

1721
01:06:59,141 --> 01:07:01,059
Keep your hands up! Don't move!

1722
01:07:01,143 --> 01:07:02,853
We-we helping. We helping, uh, Officer.

1723
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:04,497
- Get on the ground! Don't move!
- Sir, this is just a big mistake.

1724
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:06,273
- We haven't done anything wrong.
- Shit.

1725
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,942
- SEAN: We actually didn't do shit.
- (groaning) Oh, no.

1726
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,420
We-we're just trying
to take her to the hospital.

1727
01:07:10,444 --> 01:07:11,671
- RAFAEL: You're under arrest.
- MADDY: Fuck. -Fucking police.

1728
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:12,863
ALICE:
You're under arrest.

1729
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:14,865
- MADDY: Oh, this burns.
- Don't move!

1730
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:16,217
- RAFAEL: Do not! Okay.
- MADDY: Why does it burn so much?

1731
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:17,492
(Maddy screams)

1732
01:07:17,576 --> 01:07:19,053
- SEAN: What? -KUNLE: Look at her shoes.
- (normal voice): Fuck.

1733
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:20,829
KUNLE:
Oh, my God, they're not cops.

1734
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:22,205
What the fuck? Shiny shit.

1735
01:07:22,289 --> 01:07:23,516
What are you doing?
What are you... Look it, look.

1736
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:24,851
KUNLE:
She's got, like, some shiny shoes on.

1737
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:26,602
- SEAN: What the fuck?
- Why are you impersonating a police officer?

1738
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:28,378
- That's so fucking illegal!
- What are...

1739
01:07:28,462 --> 01:07:30,213
Wait, Rafa?

1740
01:07:30,297 --> 01:07:32,567
- What are you doing here, dude?
- What are you doing here?

1741
01:07:32,591 --> 01:07:35,093
We-we just rolled into a ditch
and-and-and...

1742
01:07:35,177 --> 01:07:37,053
We've been looking for her sister, man.

1743
01:07:37,137 --> 01:07:38,346
ALICE:
Wait, you know them?

1744
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:39,431
Yeah, that's my cousin.

1745
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:41,057
Yeah, we're-we're related.

1746
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:42,893
What the fuck is going on right now?

1747
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:45,020
- Stay back!
- Bitch, if you spray us,

1748
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:46,831
- we gonna have an issue.
- Don't fuck with me!

1749
01:07:46,855 --> 01:07:49,041
- Stay back!
- KUNLE: Please don't call her a bitch right now.

1750
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,710
- All right, my bad, but chill.
- Okay, okay.

1751
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:53,069
Can y'all just tell her to chill
so we can calm down?

1752
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:54,237
Please chill.

1753
01:07:54,321 --> 01:07:56,031
Okay, but you guys aren't, like,

1754
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:57,866
- kidnapping that girl, right?
- SEAN: What?

1755
01:07:57,949 --> 01:07:59,802
- What the fuck, boy?
- No. Why would we kidnap a girl?

1756
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:01,262
- CARLOS: No, no, no, no, no. We don't even know her.
- I gotta make sure.

1757
01:08:01,286 --> 01:08:02,513
- There's a van and a girl, you know?
- Wait, wait, wait.

1758
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:04,137
Okay, I'm sorry, wait. He's your cousin?

1759
01:08:04,206 --> 01:08:05,665
- Yeah.
- CARLOS: Yeah.

1760
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:09,002
Uh, you don't look...

1761
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,629
Oh, yeah, um... (laughs)

1762
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:12,589
He-he looks, like, super white.

1763
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:14,108
- He gets that all the time.
- Yeah. I'm Mexican.

1764
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:15,359
Okay, but-but what are you guys
doing here?

1765
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:16,903
KUNLE:
We're trying to take her to the hospital.

1766
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:18,446
Yeah, -We-we found her, and
she was, she was in our house,

1767
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:19,906
- and she was unconscious.
- You found her?

1768
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:21,407
And she started, like,
throwing up everywhere.

1769
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:22,742
- MADDY: This is bullshit.
- It's not bullshit.

1770
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:23,993
- Hey, look, just...
- Why would I lie to you?

1771
01:08:24,017 --> 01:08:25,644
Just let him explain, all right?

1772
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,354
No! Let me talk to my sister!

1773
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:28,688
SEAN:
Go ahead.

1774
01:08:28,772 --> 01:08:31,525
- Got it? Go. Just... Emma?
- Oh, my God.

1775
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:34,945
We found your sister like this
passed out on our floor.

1776
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:36,988
MADDY:
Emma! Emma, did they hurt you?

1777
01:08:37,072 --> 01:08:38,323
- Did we hurt...
- See?

1778
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:39,533
- MADDY: Emma.
- See?

1779
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:41,093
White girl, Black dudes. What'd I say?

1780
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,953
Dude, how'd you guys even find us?

1781
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:44,204
Oh.

1782
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:46,915
Find My Fr...?

1783
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:49,960
Wait, but sh-she doesn't even
have a cell phone.

1784
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:54,339
(grunts)

1785
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:57,509
- Wow. -Mm.
- Oh, uh...

1786
01:08:57,592 --> 01:08:59,511
We didn't look there.

1787
01:08:59,594 --> 01:09:01,555
Guys, I can't hear anything.

1788
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,139
Okay, well, if she's still breathing,

1789
01:09:03,223 --> 01:09:05,475
then that means
that her heart is still beating.

1790
01:09:05,559 --> 01:09:07,370
- Okay, I'm just trying to help.
- You're just trying to help?

1791
01:09:07,394 --> 01:09:09,789
- Yes.
- Then why are we in the middle of a fucking forest right now?

1792
01:09:09,813 --> 01:09:11,916
And why did you guys stop
at some weird house on the way here?

1793
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,775
We were trying to avoid
getting pulled over.

1794
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:15,318
We have a taillight that's out.

1795
01:09:15,402 --> 01:09:17,505
And we were trying to get another car
from his brother...

1796
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:19,990
CARLOS:
We know that this sounds weird, bad...

1797
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:21,259
- RAFAEL: The taillight is out.
- Exactly.

1798
01:09:21,283 --> 01:09:22,635
- Thank you.
- MADDY: They're fucking lying.

1799
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:24,870
What the fuck is your problem?

1800
01:09:24,953 --> 01:09:26,353
He just said the taillight was out.

1801
01:09:26,413 --> 01:09:28,748
Why are you so damn bent
on making us the bad guy?

1802
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:30,560
And why the fuck was you so quick
to pepper-spray us?

1803
01:09:30,584 --> 01:09:32,586
Huh? What, 'cause we Black?

1804
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:34,296
- No! What?
- We scare you that much?

1805
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:36,131
Maddy, what if there's a chance
that this is

1806
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:37,966
just one big, weird misunderstanding?

1807
01:09:38,049 --> 01:09:39,676
I mean, it-it kind of tracks.

1808
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:40,945
Are you just gonna believe them?

1809
01:09:40,969 --> 01:09:42,154
What, are you a fucking idiot?

1810
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,763
No, Maddy, I'm not a fucking idiot.

1811
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:45,616
- He genuinely looks like he's trying to help.
- Okay, um… Okay, excuse me.

1812
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,725
- Don't touch her!
- Okay.

1813
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:47,994
- Oh, God.
- SEAN: He's certified to help.

1814
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:49,311
CARLOS:
He-he's certified.

1815
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:50,872
KUNLE:
How much has she drank tonight?

1816
01:09:50,896 --> 01:09:52,272
- I don't fucking know.
- Okay.

1817
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:54,858
Well, she seems to be getting drunker
and-and-and...

1818
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:56,818
I don't know, she threw up a lot earlier,

1819
01:09:56,902 --> 01:09:58,629
but I-I don't know
if that's gonna be enough.

1820
01:09:58,653 --> 01:10:00,047
She's gonna be okay, though, right?

1821
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:01,948
She's not gonna, like, die, right?

1822
01:10:02,032 --> 01:10:03,950
Hey, when did you call 911?

1823
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:05,452
Like ten minutes ago.

1824
01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:07,513
They're sort of having trouble
figuring out where we are.

1825
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:10,081
Guys, she's getting colder.

1826
01:10:10,165 --> 01:10:11,791
KUNLE:
Oh. Hey, we-we need...

1827
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:14,294
We need to get her

01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:11,578
I was so fucking scared, man.

2163
01:28:11,662 --> 01:28:13,455
No, I know.

2164
01:28:15,082 --> 01:28:17,543
- (exhales) All right...
- (Kunle sobbing)

2165
01:28:18,127 --> 01:28:19,628
I know.

2166
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:22,464
I was so scared.

2167
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:24,717
I don't know, man.

2168
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,301
I'm really sorry about all of this.

2169
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:28,387
I'm really sorry about the Legendary Tour.

2170
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:29,722
- And, um...
- (laughs)

2171
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:31,265
Fuck the tour.

2172
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:33,726
I almost lost my brother. (chuckles)

2173
01:28:33,809 --> 01:28:36,103
Give a fuck about a tour.

2174
01:28:36,186 --> 01:28:38,022
It was never about the parties, man.

2175
01:28:38,105 --> 01:28:40,024
(whispers):
The fucking parties.

2176
01:28:46,363 --> 01:28:49,742
(sniffs) When I found out
that you was going to Princeton,

2177
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:51,368
shit, I just got happy as shit.

2178
01:28:51,452 --> 01:28:52,995
Wh-wh-what?

2179
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:54,788
Wait, you knew I was going to Princeton?

2180
01:28:54,872 --> 01:28:56,248
(laughing):
Yeah.

2181
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:59,585
Man, I knew before you did.

2182
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:03,839
Saw that big-ass envelope in the mail.

2183
01:29:03,922 --> 01:29:05,632
I don't know, man, I just...

2184
01:29:05,716 --> 01:29:07,468
Look, everybody know
that you gonna be like

2185
01:29:07,551 --> 01:29:12,848
the Barack Obama
of fungus and bacteria and such,

2186
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:15,434
win a Nobel Prize and shit, man.

2187
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:18,062
You gonna have your own Wikipedia page,
you fucking nerd.

2188
01:29:18,145 --> 01:29:19,855
(both laugh)

2189
01:29:21,148 --> 01:29:23,650
You gonna change the world, bro.

2190
01:29:24,777 --> 01:29:28,363
Ten years from now, none of this shit
gonna mean nothing to you.

2191
01:29:31,992 --> 01:29:33,202
(sniffles)

2192
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:35,120
It just scared me, bro.

2193
01:29:35,204 --> 01:29:37,498
You wasn't gonna say nothing to me.

2194
01:29:37,581 --> 01:29:40,501
Just gonna leave and...
(shuddering exhale)

2195
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:43,879
Just tried to do something, you know?

2196
01:29:43,962 --> 01:29:46,882
The-the Legendary Tour
would've worked, you know?

2197
01:29:46,965 --> 01:29:49,968
We could've been
on the Wall of Firsts, and...

2198
01:29:50,052 --> 01:29:51,970
I don't know, man.

2199
01:29:55,224 --> 01:29:59,394
Something to prove that, you know, uh,
I guess we both went here together.

2200
01:30:00,646 --> 01:30:02,731
And we was friends, you know?

2201
01:30:05,818 --> 01:30:08,195
Come on, Sean...

2202
01:30:08,278 --> 01:30:12,616
we are still going to be friends
when we graduate.

2203
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:14,993
Yeah, yeah.

2204
01:30:15,077 --> 01:30:16,745
Yeah.

2205
01:30:17,788 --> 01:30:20,290
You're my best friend.

2206
01:30:21,834 --> 01:30:23,669
You're my best friend, too.

2207
01:30:29,383 --> 01:30:31,552
And I really was going to tell you
about Princeton.

2208
01:30:31,635 --> 01:30:35,889
It's just, um... I was. I just...
I'm not even sure if I want to go.

2209
01:30:35,973 --> 01:30:37,575
- All right. (chuckles)
- I'm serious. I'm not...

2210
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:39,410
Just because we're emotional
don't mean that we're stupid.

2211
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:40,936
I'm just not sure I...

2212
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:43,147
Look, it's Princeton.

2213
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:45,149
You got to fucking go to Princeton.

2214
01:30:45,232 --> 01:30:47,860
You earned it, and you deserve it, Le.

2215
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:52,781
Plus, I don't even got a job.
I could move closer to you.

2216
01:30:52,865 --> 01:30:54,616
Wait, where is... where is...

2217
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:57,035
Where is, uh, Princeton?

2218
01:30:58,245 --> 01:30:59,997
It's in New Jersey.

2219
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,166
- Oh, fuck. I-I...
- I know. I know.

2220
01:31:02,249 --> 01:31:03,489
I know, it's New Jersey, but...

2221
01:31:03,542 --> 01:31:04,978
- it's not that...
- Yeah, I-I should've thought first.

2222
01:31:05,002 --> 01:31:07,713
It's... Yeah, it's still Jersey.

2223
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:09,440
But it's an hour away from Philly
and New York,

2224
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:10,859
- so that's at least...
- (water running)

2225
01:31:10,883 --> 01:31:13,385
I would not drink that.

2226
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:14,970
It's just water, Kunle. I'm thirsty.

2227
01:31:15,053 --> 01:31:16,847
It... Okay.

2228
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:19,850
You know what, I think you can have
your own Wikipedia page, too.

2229
01:31:19,933 --> 01:31:21,602
- Mm.
- Yeah.

But finishing your thesis, graduating...

2231
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:24,747
- Oh, shit.
- These are baby steps.

2232
01:31:24,771 --> 01:31:26,457
Like, we don't have to have
it all planned out

2233
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:27,834
- if we can just take...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

2234
01:31:27,858 --> 01:31:31,403
- I can have... What?
- Hey, hey, hey, calm... calm.

2235
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:33,322
No more lectures, all right?

2236
01:31:35,282 --> 01:31:37,034
Deal. No more lectures.

01:31:39,995 --> 01:31:41,538
I love you, bro.

2240
01:31:43,457 --> 01:31:46,585
I love you, too, man.

2241
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:49,796
- Group hug!
- What? Oh, shit.

2242
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:51,232
- Group hug is coming!
- It's okay.

2243
01:31:51,256 --> 01:31:52,633
- (grunting)
- It's all right.

2244
01:31:52,716 --> 01:31:54,176
- Let me in. Let me in.
- Wait, wait.

2245
01:31:54,259 --> 01:31:56,178
You got to move your fanny pack
out the way.

2246
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:58,281
- Hey. Oh.
- So you can get in here without poking people.

2247
01:31:58,305 --> 01:31:59,598
Oh, tuck in.

2248
01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:01,201
- Oh, it feels good, right?
- It's good. -Yeah.

2249
01:32:01,225 --> 01:32:02,684
- There you go.
- It's great.

2250
01:32:02,768 --> 01:32:04,579
- No, don't, don't, don't go up and down.
- Oh, don't-don't go up and down.

2251
01:32:04,603 --> 01:32:06,039
- Don't go up and down.
- That's a little too much.

- That's where it ends.

you're having.

01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,915
Um... (chuckles)

2331
01:35:11,998 --> 01:35:14,251
For everything.

2332
01:35:14,334 --> 01:35:17,295
Getting me to the hospital and...

2333
01:35:17,379 --> 01:35:22,008
Sorry for apparently breaking in
and throwing up everywhere.

2334
01:35:22,092 --> 01:35:23,927
So embarrassing.

2335
01:35:24,010 --> 01:35:26,471
MADDY:
Yeah, I-I literally live two doors down,

2336
01:35:26,555 --> 01:35:29,641
so I think she thought this was my house.

2337
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:31,726
That's what we think I thought.

2338
01:35:31,810 --> 01:35:34,187
We don't really know
because I don't remember...

2339
01:35:34,271 --> 01:35:35,647
- anything.
- Right.

2340
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:37,357
(short chuckle)

2341
01:35:37,441 --> 01:35:39,192
MADDY:
But, uh, yeah, we can...

2342
01:35:39,276 --> 01:35:41,736
we can help pay for any rugs
that need to be cleaned or...

2343
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:43,238
KUNLE:
It's cool.

2344
01:35:43,321 --> 01:35:45,866
- It's hard... it's hardwood floors.
- MADDY: Or... Right.

2345
01:35:45,949 --> 01:35:47,492
Or the car.

2346
01:35:47,576 --> 01:35:49,178
- 'Cause I know that...
- It's fine. We're just happy

2347
01:35:49,202 --> 01:35:51,580
that you're, uh... that you're better.

2348
01:35:52,622 --> 01:35:54,809
MADDY: Uh, Emma, Emma,
why don't you go ahead and, uh...

2349
01:35:54,833 --> 01:35:56,751
I'ma talk to them for a second.

2350
01:35:56,835 --> 01:35:58,170
- Yeah.
- Cool.

2351
01:35:58,253 --> 01:36:00,255
Great.

2352
01:36:00,338 --> 01:36:02,966
I had, uh, something I wanted to say.

2353
01:36:03,049 --> 01:36:04,926
- (paper rustling)
- Just one second.

2354
01:36:05,010 --> 01:36:06,428
Uh...

2355
01:36:06,511 --> 01:36:08,096
Okay, um...

2356
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:12,309
Kunle, Carlos...

2357
01:36:14,352 --> 01:36:16,813
I want to extend my deepest apologies

2358
01:36:16,897 --> 01:36:19,065
for what transpired the other night.

2359
01:36:19,149 --> 01:36:22,527
I'm working on myself and what I put out
into the world, and...

2360
01:36:22,611 --> 01:36:24,613
Oh.

2361
01:36:24,696 --> 01:36:25,906
Um...

2362
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:28,992
