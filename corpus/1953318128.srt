00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:53,898
I took him to see
some of the folks
he's been helping.

A bunch of people
made homeless
by the hurricanes.

00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,805
He's super cute.

Well, I thought
she was with you.

00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:50,188
No, she was. But,

361
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,389
you know...

362
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:54,358
I gotta give her

the punch list is done
then you'll get the balance.

Please hurry, okay?

368
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:29,927
I need to lease

Okay, just hang on
one second, please.

you complete the punch list

why don't you just
leave out some

No. The toy's important.

If you have nothing,
no home, nothing,

then a toy
would mean a lot.

if it's cheap or expensive.

put some money
on the back rent.

give me to the end

to put some
money together?

I can do about that.

Okay.
Mmm-hmm.

the instructions?

Yes, ma'am, we did.

505
00:26:57,717 --> 00:27:01,352
And, um, they just served
to confuse us more,
if you know what I mean.

506
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:04,288
There's an 800
number helpline.
Did you call it?

507
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,390
Yes, ma'am,
we did call that helpline

508
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:08,392
and, uh,
there was quite a wait

509
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:12,262
and when we finally
did get a human being
on the line,

510
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:17,101
um, how shall I put it,
that human being seemed
just as confused as we were.

So...

512
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:20,638
I don't know
what to tell you then.

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,173
You want to establish
a tax-free exempt status,

514
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:25,275
you have to apply
like everyone else.

515
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:27,378
Well, ma'am,
what we were hoping

516
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,414
is that somebody
could just walk us
through the application.

517
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:32,883
What? There's no one here
who does that.

518
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:36,920
That's what
the 800 number is for.
And the instructions.

519
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:39,189
Right. The instructions.

520
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:45,229
Okay, well,
thank you for your help.

521
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,698
Wait.

522
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,200
Ma'am.

523
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,904
You know any kids?
Of course.

524
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:55,673
I have
three grandchildren.

525
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:58,042
Well, I'm trying
to help kids.

526
00:27:58,044 --> 00:27:59,309
Kids without homes.

527
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:01,812
You? You're trying
to help them?

528
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,180
Yep.

529
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:06,784
This 501(c)(3) thing
is for me.

530
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:08,085
You see, um,

531
00:28:08,087 --> 00:28:10,320
Zach here has been
collecting donations

532
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:12,890
for hurricane victim relief
for most of the year.

533
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:15,092
And now he wants to do
the same thing
for homeless kids.

534
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:18,262
But I need this
501(c)(3) thing...

535
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:20,297
Yeah. To make it all legal.

536
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,833
This 501(c)(3) thing.

537

(CHUCKLING)

538
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,937
What if one of your
grandchildren was homeless?

539
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:30,007
Oh, don't try and
soft soap me, mister.

540
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,813
How would you like
to go to lunch with me?

541
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,982
Hey, Mom.

542
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,021
Where were you?
I was worried.

543
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:47,758
Oh, um, I sold the rest
of my games and those DVDs.

544
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,892
I got over $40.

545
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:57,835
Oh, sweets.

546
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,049
Listen, I need you
to go and pack a bag.

547
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:14,785
Are we going on a trip?

548
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:16,253
We have to move. Tonight.

549
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,122
And we have to be
very quiet about it.

550
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:19,990
We can't let
Mr. Deason see us.

551
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,393
Why? Where are we going?

552
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:25,262
Are we going to a hotel?

553
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:27,197
We don't have enough
money for a hotel,

554
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:29,533
we're gonna have
to stay in the car.

555
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:32,136
In the car?

556
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:34,404
It's just for a little while.
Till I can figure out
some things.

557
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,840
Well, what about school?

558
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:38,976
You go to school
like you always do.

559
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,514
Now go pack.

560
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:45,282

561
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:55,559
What about all my stuff?

562
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:58,495
My computer,
my Gamebite, my stuff.

563
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:00,430
We're gonna have to leave
a lot of the stuff behind.

564
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:02,232
I'm leaving a note
for Mr. Deason,

565
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,034
telling him he can sell it
to make up for what we owe...

566
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:05,369
Sell my stuff. No!

567
00:30:05,371 --> 00:30:07,371
I am leaving a lot
of my stuff behind, too.

568
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:09,306

Now go on.

569
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:13,177

I already moved
and I lost all my...

570

No, it's not fair.

571
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:17,381
It's not fair.
I'm sorry.

572
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,954

and pack a bag.

even invited him
over for dinner

and tried to get
to know him? No!

to know him to know
that you're...

(SIGHS) Well,
to Washington D.C. then.

It'd be great publicity.

more about homeless kids.

how far that is?

raise money for food.

1002

Get donations
from restaurants, I bet.

1003
00:50:05,702 --> 00:50:09,005
And I called Kristy
from Lazydays

1004
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:11,107
to see if we can
borrow an RV

1005
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:13,576
so we wouldn't have
to go to hotels.

1006
00:50:13,578 --> 00:50:16,512
Their charity might
give us some money
for gas.

1007
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,215
Are you telling me

1008
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,117
that you called

1009

No!

1011
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:29,225
I was just doing research.

1012
00:50:29,227 --> 00:50:32,428
I asked her "if".
They said that they
"might" help.

1013
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:34,663
"Might", Zach.

1014
00:50:34,665 --> 00:50:36,799
That is a long way
from "yes".

00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:39,268
Okay.

1016
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,771
But, Mom,

1017
00:50:41,773 --> 00:50:45,608
if I get the RV
and raise enough money

1018
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:48,244
and figure out
the house thing,

1019
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,080
can I do it?

1020
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:57,319
Do you know
how long it would take
to walk that far?

1021
00:50:57,321 --> 00:50:59,055
Most of the summer,
probably.

1022
00:50:59,057 --> 00:51:02,224
And your sister and I
have plans.

1023
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:04,293
Kelley, you can help, too.

1024
00:51:04,295 --> 00:51:07,196
It'd be fun.
You could do
the publicity stuff.

1025
00:51:07,198 --> 00:51:08,764
You're really
good at that.

1026
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:11,434
Look, you can go on ahead,

1027
00:51:11,436 --> 00:51:14,437
but you're doing

1548
01:21:55,611 --> 01:21:57,311
They call 'em Zach Packs.

1549

and that one's yours to keep.

You're welcome.

follow me this way

1552

is you don't care about

about yourself.

manage by yourself

1710
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:34,134
I was young
and in love once.

1711
01:29:34,136 --> 01:29:36,636
I loved and then I lost.

1712
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:39,473
And I loved again,

1713
01:29:39,475 --> 01:29:41,575
and lost again.

1714
01:29:41,577 --> 01:29:45,045
And somewhere between
the hurt and the hollow...

1715
01:29:46,147 --> 01:29:48,448
Well,

1716
01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:51,418
I just figured
I wasn't much good at that.

1717
01:29:51,953 --> 01:29:54,054
So, I gave it up.

1718
01:29:54,056 --> 01:29:55,722
I put everything I have,

1719
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:58,558
my heart and my soul
into my children.

1720
01:30:00,695 --> 01:30:03,029
Family is everything to me.

1721
01:30:04,866 --> 01:30:06,666
You know that.

1722
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:10,404
I'm asking you
to come back.

1723
01:30:10,872 --> 01:30:12,873
Please.

1724
01:30:12,875 --> 01:30:15,108
I can't do that.

1725
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:16,543
Why?

1726
01:30:18,546 --> 01:30:21,114
You treat Zach
better than me.

1727
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:24,050
Admit it.

1728
01:30:30,792 --> 01:30:32,092
Yes, I do.

1729
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,060
See!

1730
01:30:34,062 --> 01:30:36,096
But do you know why?

1731
01:30:36,098 --> 01:30:38,632
Because you love him
more than me,
you always have.

1732
01:30:38,634 --> 01:30:41,034
That's where
you're wrong, Kel.

1733
01:30:41,036 --> 01:30:44,171
I treat him better
because I learned how.

1734
01:30:44,173 --> 01:30:46,139
And I learned it
messing up with you.

1735
01:30:46,141 --> 01:30:49,009
I admit it.
I messed up.

1736
01:30:49,011 --> 01:30:51,011
It was on the job training

1737
01:30:51,013 --> 01:30:53,213
and I didn't know
what I was doing
half the time.

1738
01:30:53,215 --> 01:30:55,649
I still mess up with Zach.

1739
01:30:55,651 --> 01:30:58,018
Sometimes I feel like
I'm just barely hanging on...

1740
01:30:58,020 --> 01:31:01,121
I don't know
what you want from me.

1741
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:05,091
I'm sorry.

1742
01:31:05,093 --> 01:31:08,462
I know that's not enough.

1743
01:31:08,464 --> 01:31:10,063
It breaks my heart
to see you in pain,

1744
01:31:10,065 --> 01:31:14,034
and knowing that
I am the cause of it
makes it even worse.

1745
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:17,604
Please, hear me.

1746
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:24,478
I'm sorry.

1747

(SOBBING) It's...

1748
01:31:29,016 --> 01:31:30,984
It's too late.

1749
01:31:33,054 --> 01:31:34,721
It is?

1750
01:31:44,632 --> 01:31:45,999
Um...

1751
01:31:47,902 --> 01:31:49,135
Well...

1752
01:31:49,137 --> 01:31:50,904
Then I guess you better
take the van.

1753
01:31:50,906 --> 01:31:52,639
I don't want
you hitching.

1754
01:31:52,641 --> 01:31:54,941
But what about
you and Zach?

1755
01:31:54,943 --> 01:31:57,110
Um, we have the RV.

1756
01:31:58,279 --> 01:32:00,113
And tomorrow?

1757
01:32:01,816 --> 01:32:03,817
Um, we'll manage.

1758

Mom.

1759
01:32:12,793 --> 01:32:17,531
Did you ever think
about doing something
just for yourself?

1760
01:32:17,533 --> 01:32:20,300
Cut me and Zach
a little bit of slack?

(SNIFFLES)

1762
01:32:25,606 --> 01:32:28,275
But I'm very happy
with you kids.

1763
01:32:30,578 --> 01:32:33,046
All I've ever wanted
was a family.

1764
01:32:56,137 --> 01:32:57,837
You be safe.

1765
01:33:57,965 --> 01:34:00,266
(SOFTLY) Zach, come here.

1766
01:34:02,036 --> 01:34:03,937
Come here, darling.

1767
01:34:15,116 --> 01:34:17,283
I never told you this.

1768
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:21,955
But when you were
just a baby and...

1769
01:34:23,224 --> 01:34:25,925
I was first a mom
with you kids...

1770
01:34:27,962 --> 01:34:29,663
We, uh...

1771
01:34:31,365 --> 01:34:33,667
We were in bad shape.

1772
01:34:34,735 --> 01:34:37,771
I was in bad shape.

1773
01:34:37,773 --> 01:34:41,408
We didn't wind up
homeless, but, um...

1774
01:34:41,410 --> 01:34:44,978
We came real, real close.

1775
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:48,748
I was as frightened
as I've ever been
in my life.

1776
01:34:49,817 --> 01:34:51,785
I was scared to death.

1777
01:34:53,187 --> 01:34:56,289
And I look at those moms
and their kids,

1778
01:34:57,191 --> 01:34:59,993
and I know that
could have been us.

1779
01:35:02,329 --> 01:35:04,798
What you're doing here,

1780
01:35:06,233 --> 01:35:09,335
it touches me, Zach.

1781
01:35:09,337 --> 01:35:12,338
In ways
I can't even explain.

1782
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:19,813
I am so proud of you.

1783
01:35:19,815 --> 01:35:23,016
And I'm so glad
I get to help you
with this.

1784
01:35:27,822 --> 01:35:30,857
So, let's you and me
finish this, okay?

1785
01:35:32,193 --> 01:35:33,727
Let's go help those kids

1786
01:35:33,729 --> 01:35:36,496
and then we'll go home,
we'll fix our own problems.

1787

accomplished here.
