1
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:01,520
It's been 500 years after the
Monkey King's havoc in heaven

2
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:04,399
The Mercy Goddess proclaims
the Buddha's decree

3
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,361
and appoints Xuanzang, a
little monk from Chang'an

4
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,112
to go to the West

5
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:14,575
and fetch the
Buddhist scriptures

6
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:49,402
Where is it over there?

7
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,361
I heard an old man say

8
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,323
it's called Double
Boundary Mountain

9
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,992
It's used to be called

10
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,329
Five Elements Mountain

11
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:04,667
Five Elements Mountain

12
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,081
Holy monk! Holy monk!

13
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:45,416
Get down now!

14
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,170
Hold on, hold on!

15
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:52,090
What shall we do with
the white horse?

16
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:53,341
So what do you think?

17
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:56,093
You're well-built. Why
don't you go save him?

18
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:58,721
- What? You take care then.
- What a nerd!

19
00:02:58,762 --> 00:02:59,930
We won't meet again!

20
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,813
Mr. Tiger

21
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:13,403
This horse has a touching story

22
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:17,656
He was an imperial horse

23
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:21,202
but he's now in this tough
and long journey with me

24
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:25,873
And he has family,
just like you do

25
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:27,082
So why not...

26
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,225
Hey there. I mean you!

27
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,934
Come closer! Closer!

28
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:46,810
Yeah, you see that?

29
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,062
Who are you?

30
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:50,940
Hey. Rip that rotten rag off!

31
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,526
Yeah. That's it!

32
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:56,445
But it's a charm

33
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:57,279
Rip it off!

34
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,405
I can't mess with a charm!

35
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,657
If you don't wanna
be the tiger's food

36
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,617
just do it!

37
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:22,281
Golden Cudgel!

38
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:34,877
Naughty boy!

39
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,974
How have you been doing?

40
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,221
So you're that guy, huh?

41
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:11,265
Well, I guess not

42
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:15,686
The Goddess asked me to go with
a monk for fetching scriptures

43
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,899
I'm afraid you're
mistaken, gentleman

44
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:24,027
I'm from the Great Tang
Dynasty in the East...

45
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,487
The Great Tang Dynasty
in the East...

46
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,531
Yes! You're that guy

47
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,658
Since the Goddess said so

48
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,577
I'm the one to escort
you to the West

49
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,953
Escort me?

50
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,165
I don't need it, I think

51
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,458
Speak louder!

52
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,335
No, thanks, gentleman!

53
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,923
You heard him, Goddess?

54
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,258
It's just he doesn't need me

55
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,343
It's not me shirking

56
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,472
Then I'm going off

57
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,592
Baldy!

58
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,302
What the heck is this?

59
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:32,012
Why can I not take it off?

60
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,432
The Goddess gave it to me

61
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:36,934
I've no idea, either

62
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,562
Baldy. Don't fool around

63
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:41,688
Take it off from me!

64
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,191
Stay still

65
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,860
There are words on it

66
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,324
Stop fidgeting

67
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,201
I can't see those words clear

68
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,372
Oh, it's Sanskrit

69
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,916
Seems I can't just read

70
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,251
- So?
- I have to chant

71
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,878
Come on sing it now! Thanks!

72
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,264
Sir!

73
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,682
Could you tough it out?

74
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,850
Probably it'll loosen if
you endure for a while

75
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,660
Stop chanting

76
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:44,751
Stay away!

77
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,169
I'll jump off if you
keep pushing me

78
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,504
Wanna die?

79
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,215
Won't be that easy

80
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:53,051
What on earth do you want?

81
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,429
Take this gold hoop off me now!

82
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,432
Or else I'm gonna
strangle you to...

83
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:04,563
I said many times I have no
idea how to loosen this hoop

84
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,658
Wukong. The young
monk here with you

85
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:20,162
was once a boy named Golden
Cicada, a Buddha's disciple

86
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:24,249
Today, he has become your master

87
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:28,962
You should protect
him and respect him

88
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:32,299
Only till the day you get the
scriptures from the Thunder Monastery

89
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,469
will your golden
hoop be loosened

90
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:40,015
There are no alternatives

91
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:43,060
I'm bringing those
stupid scriptures back

92
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:47,230
The Goddess hasn't finished yet

93
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,903
Somersault Cloud!

94
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,036
In a heartbeat

95
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,501
Where is that monastery?

96
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,005
Gentleman!

97
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:15,384
How could it be?

98
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,843
The Goddess asked me to tell you

99
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:21,807
There's no way to fly there
with one stroke like this

100
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,685
Every suffering on the
journey is predestined

101
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,520
Every step is a
spiritual practice

102
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:29,856
- No way!
- This is how wonderful life is

103
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,025
What did you say?
Every step for what?

104
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,068
Wonderful?

105
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,236
Yeah, full of wonder

106
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,863
I wonder

107
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,034
Hey Goddess, where are you?
Hello?

108
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,619
Gentleman

109
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,745
The Goddess can hear you

110
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,205
No need to be loud

111
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:46,498
Shut up!

112
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:00,595
Go away!

113
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,974
How dare you!

114
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,351
Give my horse back!

115
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,276
Enlarge!

116
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,694
Enlarge!

117
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,867
Isn't it wonderful?

118
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,749
If it's always so
wonderful all the way

119
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,711
we could share the
journey together

120
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:30,519
You've eaten our horse.
I have to get even

121
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,648
So you acquiesce?

122
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:53,667
Bro Monkey

123
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,460
Good boy

124
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,464
What's with you?
Just mount the horse

125
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,258
Don't expect I'll carry you

126
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:07,931
Gentleman, you may not
have to kill next time

127
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,850
shall we discuss
before you do that?

128
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,309
Not a chance

129
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,436
Why don't you ride the horse?

130
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,771
Flying is so tiring, isn't it?

131
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:15,939
How come you're so wordy!

132
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:17,732
Can't you just shut up?

133
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,914
It's very late now. White Bone
is coming out to snatch kids

134
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,750
Dad, it's not scary at all

135
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:37,919
It's true

136
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,506
Gentleman, you may not
have to kill next time

137
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,550
Let me check

138
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:45,760
Alright. Forget it. Let's close

139
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:46,887
Yes

140
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:13,747
Lady White... please don't!
No! Lady White!

141
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,916
Don't get my daughter!

142
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,876
Please! Please don't!

143
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,962
Lady White! No!

144
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,422
Sweetie

145
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:24,299
So late at night

146
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,384
sun up?

147
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,099
How dare you!

148
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,645
After so much evil is done

149
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,356
you can't just always
pass the buck to me

150
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,822
Everyone has mistaken me

151
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,660
Tell me. What am I
supposed to do?

152
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,501
Madam, please spare me

153
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:08,088
I swear I won't do it again

154
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:19,349
I swear as well, that
you won't do it again

155
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:23,978
We just can't go against
our king's decree

156
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,731
Oh really?

157
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,486
So you go against me

158
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:40,633
You fear?

159
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,179
Then why not just go home?

160
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,932
I must get the scriptures
just because I have fear

161
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:49,726
What's that stuff about?

162
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,394
The truth

163
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,522
The truth about the world

164
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,107
Monk

165
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,318
There's only one way

166
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,654
to know about the truth

167
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,284
That's my Fiery Eyes

168
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,456
Aren't they scary?

169
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:19,630
Pervert! Pervert!

170
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,052
Pervert!

171
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:04,884
Naughty boy!

172
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:11,849
My friend

173
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,976
I have to say your monkey

174
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,562
is a really good breed

175
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:20,108
But he just looks... too ugly

176
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,121
You are not a monkey master

177
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,872
You are the scripture fetcher

178
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,126
Yes, I am

179
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:41,254
Here you are, finally

180
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:56,269
Bro Sha!

181
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:00,273
Bajie!

182
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,614
How come I'm so handsome?

183
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,914
How dare you, pig demon!

184
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,832
Don't hold up my business!

185
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,335
Hey. again?

186
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,045
Hey no! Cut it out!

187
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,965
Stop! No!

188
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:11,052
Won't you stop?

189
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,136
Okay?

190
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,788
Do you envy me...

191
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:42,833
...looking better than you?

192
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,398
You ran into me!

193
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,525
Are you blind?

194
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,373
Oh my gosh

195
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,238
Wanna go?

196
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,208
Cut it out! Cut it out!

197
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,501
I'm quitting, really

198
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:12,965
I'm so cute. Am I wrong?

199
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,218
One by one, You first

200
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,053
Pig!

201
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,263
We are both waiting for
the scripture fetcher

202
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,057
under the guidance
of the Mercy Goddess

203
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:24,185
We need to protect him as
his disciples all the way

204
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,436
My name is Zhu Ganglie

205
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:28,147
I've sworn to the Goddess that
I'll abstain from eating meat

206
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:30,775
Bro Monkey, you can
also call me Bajie

207
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,152
My name is Sha Wujing

208
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:36,072
Do you know who I am?

209
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:40,576
The Handsome Monkey King from the
Mountain of Flowers and Fruit

210
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,413
Then why are you still lying?

211
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:46,749
Within 3 sentences

212
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,377
if you cannot justify
what you've said

213
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:51,462
I slaughter you!

214
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:54,548
No! Every word
we've said is true

215
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,466
- Yeah!
- It's the first one

216
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:57,301
Does it count?

217
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:58,594
This one counts, too

218
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:01,597
Mr. Scripture Fetcher!

219
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:02,932
No!

220
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,559
Wukong. Stop!

221
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:07,603
They are monsters

222
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,026
Are you not?

223
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:15,403
Out of my way

224
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,570
If you insist

225
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:19,115
just push me off here

226
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:23,077
Master...

227
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:34,380
Amitabha

228
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,549
I killed people

229
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,636
Someone is spying on us

230
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:52,732
Madam, that monk is almost here

231
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:55,526
Shall we celebrate?

232
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:57,153
What's it to you?

233
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:59,572
This monk is Madam's food

234
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,973
How many times have I told you?

235
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:29,226
I need the flower alive

236
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:33,981
You are really a
clumsy flatterer

237
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:38,360
Madam is a thousand years old,
filled with severe grudge

238
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:40,571
Any living thing in her hands

239
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:42,865
Suffers as if in hell

240
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,350
Have you lived long enough?

241
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:13,187
Madam, I'm wrong

242
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,526
What do you mean by
"as if in hell"?

243
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:21,946
I am the hell

244
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:29,453
In three days' time, it'll
be your reincarnation, Madam

245
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,581
If you can eat that monk by then

246
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:34,542
you don't need the cycle anymore

247
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:40,172
So you'll be a demon
forever, Madam

248
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:44,009
There are 3 days to go...

249
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,388
I'll snatch him back here

250
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,765
No hurry

251
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,727
Let me have some fun first

252
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:10,119
Wujing, it's quite late

253
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,162
Let's find us a place
to settle down

254
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,622
But it's noon now

255
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:29,555
It's foggy now

256
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:40,608
Master, where's the path?

257
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:45,779
Wujing, a scripture says that

258
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:49,116
being deluded, a
Buddha is everyone

259
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:50,826
while being awakened,
everyone is a Buddha

260
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:54,413
Even your eyes are
wide open, it's no use

261
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:55,956
You still can't see the path

262
00:31:56,624 --> 00:32:00,169
You have to make a
path step by step

263
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,796
You understand?

264
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:13,849
Look

265
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:17,519
This is how wonderful life is

266
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,732
Where's Bajie?

267
00:32:30,908 --> 00:32:33,285
Monk. It's so demonic here

268
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:34,787
You stay here

269
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,288
I'll check it out

270
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:41,085
I got it at last!

271
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,342
Anybody in?

272
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,536
Monster!

273
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,831
- Human?
- Monster! Monster!

274
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,082
Don't panic

275
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:03,333
Don't come over

276
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,502
Come on. Come on

277
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:06,920
Master

278
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,881
Bro Bajie is yelling

279
00:34:10,174 --> 00:34:11,383
Stop!

280
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:13,302
I'm different from
those kept as food

281
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:15,387
I'm a pet!

282
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:22,311
Please. We didn't
do anything evil

283
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:23,937
Don't hurt us

284
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:27,441
Please stand up

285
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:33,530
Stand up

286
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,492
Amitabha

287
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:38,243
I'm afraid you're mistaken

288
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:41,371
Though this disciple
looks a bit un...

289
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,207
unreasonable

290
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,918
But he's quite honest

291
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,920
The four of us are
just passers-by

292
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,089
We only want to
beg for some food

293
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:52,132
Thank you

294
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:55,427
The four of you...

295
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,555
And me, Sun Wukong

296
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:06,021
It's really demonic here

297
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:08,690
Why do you live here?

298
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,320
I'm used to it

299
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:24,248
It's getting windy

300
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:37,678
Are you hungry?

301
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:40,055
Let's get in

302
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:42,474
It's so windy. Let's get inside

303
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:43,851
Come on in...

304
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,270
- Come on - Yes, Master

305
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:51,775
Put down your knives...

306
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:54,903
Cook some vegetarian food

307
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:58,907
Sit down, please

308
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,255
Bro Sha, water

309
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:16,425
Big brother, water

310
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:22,764
I need it cool

311
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,226
Cool water?

312
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:28,812
Blow to cool it

313
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:31,190
Yeah. That's right

314
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:32,441
Blow it

315
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,323
Are those girls your daughters?

316
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:44,244
Your homestead just needs

317
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:46,330
a live-in son-in-law

318
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:48,498
Bajie

319
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,791
Master. I'm doing promotion

320
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,293
Be quiet

321
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:56,381
Reverend sir, please
leave us alone

322
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:57,674
Don't worry

323
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,219
I can give you a warranty
of lifelong happiness

324
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:03,555
Your pig face

325
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:05,390
will frighten them

326
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:08,310
No problem now?

327
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,279
Young boy

328
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:24,534
No problem

329
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,496
I'll be extremely filial to you

330
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:31,416
Sweeties. I'm coming

331
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:34,753
Wujing

332
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:37,381
keep a close watch on
him, eyes wide open

333
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:39,466
Eyes wide open?

334
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:40,092
Like this?

335
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,718
Yes, yes, go ahead

336
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:53,397
I notice you've been
rubbing your eyes

337
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,066
There's a creek over there

338
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:57,693
Go wash them there

339
00:37:58,068 --> 00:38:00,070
Yeah, Wukong

340
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:02,197
if your eyes aren't feeling well

341
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:03,657
wash them and you'll feel comfy

342
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:05,450
Just go wash them

343
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:10,247
Sit down

344
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:32,394
You can't step out of this
circle until I'm back

345
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,315
Wukong, this circle is too small

346
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,191
Large enough

347
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:41,778
Wukong. Not enough, indeed

348
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,703
Two sweeties

349
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,082
Come on out

350
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,210
Sweeties

351
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:03,300
Honey

352
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:07,262
No one else is here.
Don't be afraid

353
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,598
Come on out

354
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:12,059
Bro Bajie

355
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:15,854
Bro Bajie

356
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:59,523
I can tell the worry
in your face, Madam

357
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:03,110
Since the karma of weal
and woe is predestined

358
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:06,446
why worry yourself sick, Madam?

359
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,294
When I was sixteen

360
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:30,929
I was forced to marry
into the purple

361
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,267
A year later

362
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:40,439
a famine took place right there.
Many people died

363
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:46,653
There was a rumor

364
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,365
that I brought on the
disaster to their village

365
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:54,077
I was seen as a demon

366
00:40:56,705 --> 00:41:01,334
The villagers abandoned
me on a lone cliff

367
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:04,546
to let the vultures
share me as food

368
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,592
to honor the gods

369
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:14,848
But later I survived

370
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:24,065
So you can say

371
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:29,070
passing time is not
necessarily a good cure

372
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:34,618
pain comes from stubbornness

373
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:27,087
In fact pain is just like

374
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,798
this little circle

375
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:33,093
It looks hard to overcome

376
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:36,263
but, as long as you take
a bold step forward

377
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,058
your pain will vanish

378
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,519
Since I can do it myself

379
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:44,771
I'm sure you can do it as well

380
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:56,074
You can't bluff my eyes

381
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:57,242
with your disguise

382
00:42:57,951 --> 00:42:58,618
Master

383
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,744
Madam

384
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:02,914
Madam

385
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:05,041
You've freaked her out

386
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:06,960
Wanna go?

387
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:08,920
Wukong...!

388
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:40,345
Come on out

389
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,940
I'm sure I'll find you soon

390
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:12,043
Big brother killed her

391
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:14,462
Madam

392
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:17,549
Madam

393
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:23,054
Madam

394
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:25,473
Are you awake?

395
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:39,195
Big brother

396
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:41,614
He's flown away

397
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:46,411
She died

398
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:48,747
It's the fault of
my first disciple

399
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:52,584
It was too wrong.
He freaked you out

400
00:45:53,293 --> 00:45:55,170
I'll keep him under
properly for sure

401
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:34,125
Master, help me

402
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:41,508
Master, the monkey
killed two girls

403
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:42,884
Big brother

404
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:44,469
You two, shut up!

405
00:46:45,804 --> 00:46:48,848
Help me! Master

406
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,642
Stop!

407
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:14,707
Evil creature

408
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:19,379
It's three lives. Your sin
of killing is too much

409
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:21,130
They are demons

410
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:22,382
How dare you quibble?

411
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:25,385
You have the power to
destroy the universe

412
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:28,346
If I let you get away
with it like this

413
00:47:28,388 --> 00:47:30,348
it'll be a disaster
for the world

414
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:31,766
It's none of your business

415
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:15,286
That damned monkey
was too fierce

416
00:49:15,328 --> 00:49:20,333
Madam, that damned monkey
is quite a trouble

417
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:27,757
Trouble?

418
00:49:29,092 --> 00:49:33,054
I like trouble...

419
00:49:33,096 --> 00:49:34,514
...most

420
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:46,234
Wukong...

421
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:50,321
Wukong

422
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:30,194
Wukong, I was just left
with no choice to do that

423
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:34,615
Are you going to use this incantation
to keep me under control?

424
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:39,704
As long as you don't
kill the innocent

425
00:50:39,746 --> 00:50:41,414
I won't use it anymore

426
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:44,292
Why do you refuse to
believe they are monsters?

427
00:51:00,308 --> 00:51:02,226
You and me are really alike

428
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:06,856
We only believe what can
be seen in our eyes

429
00:51:10,193 --> 00:51:11,527
Now I understand why

430
00:51:12,153 --> 00:51:15,490
the Buddha made the two of
us together on this journey

431
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:20,870
Wukong, look at
these prayer beads

432
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:25,374
Every bead is from different
corners of the world

433
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:30,171
But they're strung
together by a string

434
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:35,426
Just like you, me,
Baijie and Wujing

435
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:38,346
What pulls us together is

436
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:41,849
this journey of 36,000
miles for the scriptures

437
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:46,270
You may not believe what I see

438
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:49,273
But I hope you believe that

439
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:52,568
every time I recite
the incantation

440
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:58,491
I feel the same pain you feel

441
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,210
That chubby white one

442
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:11,045
must be Bajie

443
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:52,503
Can someone take pity on us?

444
00:52:52,879 --> 00:52:54,797
Please help save my daughter

445
00:52:55,256 --> 00:52:57,592
My girl was snatched
by the monsters

446
00:52:57,633 --> 00:52:59,343
Can someone save her?

447
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:03,014
White Bone Spirit got my girl!

448
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:11,314
Your Majesty, the Tang Priest

449
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:12,940
and his men have
entered our country

450
00:53:13,608 --> 00:53:14,942
They're in the city now

451
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,324
Welcome them with a banquet

452
00:53:37,173 --> 00:53:37,924
Water is good

453
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:38,966
Nice!

454
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:02,949
Your Majesty, is that painting

455
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:05,493
just about the monster
rumored in the town?

456
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:08,079
Exactly

457
00:54:10,206 --> 00:54:11,582
Ages ago

458
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:14,585
The Kingdom of Cloud
was prosperous

459
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:19,048
Ever since this White
Bone Spirit moved in

460
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:22,677
she's done all kinds of evil and
has snatched countless kids

461
00:54:25,972 --> 00:54:27,640
She feeds on these young kids

462
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:32,812
With the nutrition from the nature,
she has improved her stamina

463
00:54:34,397 --> 00:54:35,523
She hangs the
children with cages

464
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:38,150
in her Moon Waters Cave

465
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:42,947
There are cries of the kids
echoing all year round

466
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:49,662
I can hear them whenever
I close my eyes

467
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:54,375
Amitabha

468
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:58,337
Don't worry, Your Majesty.
There must be a way

469
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:05,511
Holy monk

470
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:08,848
Your Majesty!

471
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:12,393
Would you rid my
people of the evil

472
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:14,603
and exorcise this
White Bone Spirit?

473
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:18,774
- Your Majesty...
- I only hope I can live long enough to

474
00:55:19,275 --> 00:55:22,903
be able to save all
these poor kids

475
00:55:24,572 --> 00:55:25,823
Please rise, Your Majesty

476
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:32,955
Amitabha. Please rise, everyone

477
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:52,350
Guard His Majesty!

478
00:56:08,616 --> 00:56:10,701
I really like you
telling stories

479
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:12,912
Repeat it

480
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:16,040
Go on with it

481
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:19,687
Are you going to help that
old gossip exorcise me?

482
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:23,941
I'm just going to urge
you to reform for good

483
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:28,028
Fine. You can do me a favor

484
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:31,157
by letting me eat you,
since I'm hungry now

485
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:32,700
Eat him now if you can

486
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:35,494
But I'm a vegetarian today

487
00:57:43,836 --> 00:57:45,463
I'm here for you

488
00:57:46,547 --> 00:57:48,132
Let's talk outside

489
00:57:48,174 --> 00:57:49,300
I have no time

490
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:51,177
Are you afraid?

491
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:55,014
QT you?

492
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:07,067
Master

493
00:58:08,277 --> 00:58:09,820
Don't be afraid, Master

494
00:58:09,862 --> 00:58:11,238
I will protect you

495
00:58:58,494 --> 00:58:59,870
What in hell do you want?

496
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:02,540
Don't hurry

497
00:59:10,673 --> 00:59:11,757
Out With it

498
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:15,010
We are both demons...

499
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:17,721
...of the same kind

500
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:23,018
That's why we should
help each other

501
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,812
What can you help me with?

502
00:59:26,647 --> 00:59:28,983
Your hoop looks nice on you

503
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:32,903
You can keep it if you like

504
00:59:33,988 --> 00:59:35,114
Why not?

505
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:38,617
But can you take it off?

506
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:45,040
Only I can help you
if you want freedom

507
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:48,294
How to?

508
00:59:49,128 --> 00:59:51,171
After I eat this monk

509
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:53,882
no one will incant to bother you

510
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:56,802
Do you believe I
can do you up now?

511
00:59:58,554 --> 00:59:59,930
Yes, do

512
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,017
Go ahead

513
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:24,913
Look at this monkey

514
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:29,126
He has to do whatever
is told by his master

515
01:00:29,585 --> 01:00:31,003
Punishment awaits him

516
01:00:31,045 --> 01:00:33,130
whenever he makes mistakes

517
01:00:33,881 --> 01:00:35,799
One cent, one somersault

518
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:38,844
Ten cents, it'll kowtow to you

519
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,360
White Bone Spirit

520
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:58,989
You don't have the
heart, do you?

521
01:01:00,491 --> 01:01:02,326
Let me be the bad guy

522
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:05,537
I love doing such things

523
01:01:06,664 --> 01:01:10,626
Ask him to meet me
tonight in person, alone

524
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:20,362
I've taken 49 doses of
this blood medicine

525
01:02:21,864 --> 01:02:23,657
but it can't dispel
my curse at all

526
01:02:24,158 --> 01:02:25,993
If I can't eat the
Tang Priest tonight

527
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:30,414
and I remain uncured,
I'll eat you instead

528
01:02:32,458 --> 01:02:33,751
Please calm down

529
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:35,753
Your Majesty

530
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:38,046
It's gone a bit different now.
Sun Wukong gets in the way

531
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,257
He's a trouble for
the Spirit too

532
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:44,428
So, as long as she
tackles that monkey

533
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:46,722
we're sure to have a chance

534
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:02,946
Wukong, are you alright?

535
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:05,991
It's been a while

536
01:03:06,033 --> 01:03:07,326
How was your talk?

537
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:09,787
Nothing special

538
01:03:10,329 --> 01:03:11,413
No way

539
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:14,082
It is impossible
she comes to you

540
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,001
without a reason

541
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:19,087
Do you really want to
enlighten this demon?

542
01:03:20,214 --> 01:03:21,215
Really

543
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:25,093
I can't leave a single life
unenlightened on this journey

544
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:27,471
I can never make myself assured

545
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:30,224
even though I can make it
through to the scripture

546
01:03:30,265 --> 01:03:31,683
I can never feel assured

547
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:35,854
Alright

548
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:38,190
This is your own choice

549
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:46,698
You really let him go alone?

550
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:49,827
I'm not sure

551
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:52,621
I'm gonna sleep if
you're still not sure

552
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,760
It's a style

553
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:38,292
Do you know what you're
supposed to do here tonight?

554
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:41,086
I'm here

555
01:04:41,837 --> 01:04:44,756
Expecting you to reform for good

556
01:04:46,216 --> 01:04:47,676
Again?

557
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:53,432
Wukong, why are you here?

558
01:04:54,683 --> 01:04:58,353
Wukong, enlightenment
is a solemn thing

559
01:04:58,395 --> 01:04:59,938
Don't fool around here

560
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:03,108
You're the one that
is fooling around

561
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:05,736
You're ridiculous

562
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:07,279
Am I ridiculous?

563
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:08,780
You are ridiculous

564
01:05:09,281 --> 01:05:12,868
Lady White, leave him alone.
Let's continue

565
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:14,661
A bunch of idiots

566
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:25,964
You really think I'm taken in?

567
01:05:38,894 --> 01:05:42,022
Bro Sha, is her face so
pale with fright now?

568
01:05:42,064 --> 01:05:43,315
Yeah

569
01:05:43,357 --> 01:05:46,068
Bro Bajie, I admire you so much

570
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:50,822
Lady White

571
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:52,699
if you have guts

572
01:05:52,741 --> 01:05:54,576
have a good fight with me

573
01:05:55,077 --> 01:05:56,495
If you defeat me

574
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:58,997
I'll marry you

575
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,457
If I lose

576
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:02,626
you'll marry me

577
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:04,586
Fair enough?

578
01:06:05,379 --> 01:06:07,506
If it's unfair to you

579
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:09,716
of course... we can
talk or think about

580
01:06:09,758 --> 01:06:11,343
...something else

581
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:16,431
Pig face. Stay away
from me, okay?

582
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:18,850
Are you scared?

583
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:20,560
OK. You left me no choice

584
01:06:20,602 --> 01:06:22,437
No one is allowed to interfere

585
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:23,522
Leave it to me!

586
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:28,485
Wukong. Can you let me finish?

587
01:06:28,527 --> 01:06:29,736
Step back

588
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:36,702
As long as you nod

589
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:39,997
I'll take this demon to nirvana

590
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:43,667
I hate being called
evil demon the most

591
01:06:45,002 --> 01:06:46,336
Evil demon

592
01:06:47,254 --> 01:06:49,965
If not, what else
should I call you?

593
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:52,259
Whatever

594
01:06:53,552 --> 01:06:55,053
Listen, I can give up everything

595
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:01,977
I'm even able to kill that monk

596
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:04,521
But! This isn't over

597
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:07,107
We'll see

598
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:23,331
Nobody move. Leave her to me

599
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:27,627
Bro Bajie!

600
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:32,883
- Bajie - Bro Sha,
stay close with Master

601
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:00,660
Someone help! I'm stuck

602
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:43,495
Master?

603
01:08:46,081 --> 01:08:46,957
Where's the monk?

604
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:47,833
I wonder where

605
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:49,042
Forget it

606
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:04,683
Where is he?

607
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:46,391
Do you know what
blood tastes like?

608
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:50,270
For years, in order
to dispel this curse

609
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:53,148
I've drunk a great amount
of blood of the kids

610
01:09:54,274 --> 01:09:55,859
Now it's your turn

611
01:09:56,776 --> 01:10:00,655
After I eat you, my
disease can be cured

612
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:08,163
This is your karmic reward

613
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:19,257
You drain others' blood
to maintain your life

614
01:10:19,299 --> 01:10:21,259
I don't see a difference
between you and the monsters

615
01:10:24,471 --> 01:10:28,433
I'll never be as venomous
as that White Bone Spirit

616
01:10:32,354 --> 01:10:36,733
Monk, the human world is
like hell since long ago

617
01:10:41,196 --> 01:10:45,242
Even the Buddha cannot
extinguish human's evil within

618
01:10:45,784 --> 01:10:47,285
Can you?

619
01:11:07,472 --> 01:11:08,473
Wukong!

620
01:11:15,647 --> 01:11:18,316
This sort of person is
more vicious than demons

621
01:11:18,817 --> 01:11:20,277
Can't I kill, either?

622
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:27,367
No, you can't

623
01:11:34,416 --> 01:11:36,293
If you keep doing evil

624
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:37,877
I'll finish you with this cudgel

625
01:11:42,132 --> 01:11:44,759
Kids. Go home now

626
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:01,067
Now. Come with me

627
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:11,202
ls the Buddha blind?

628
01:12:12,037 --> 01:12:13,621
Entrusting a wimp like you?

629
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:17,459
If it weren't for him, killing
all the way with his cudgel

630
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:19,711
you could go nowhere!

631
01:12:20,337 --> 01:12:22,589
What merits and retribution
are you looking to?

632
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:24,507
Every word you say is nonsense

633
01:12:24,549 --> 01:12:26,134
and every step you
take could kill

634
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:30,263
By what right do you
act like a sage?

635
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:34,768
By what right? Tell me!

636
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:41,399
Thanks, holy monk

637
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:43,360
Morn

638
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:46,446
The holy monk saved them all

639
01:12:51,785 --> 01:12:53,203
Let's hurry on

640
01:13:21,356 --> 01:13:22,774
Holy monk, please wait

641
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:24,609
The folks of our kingdom

642
01:13:24,651 --> 01:13:26,903
will be grateful for
your kindness forever

643
01:13:26,945 --> 01:13:28,571
Please accept our gifts

644
01:13:29,531 --> 01:13:31,699
You saved my daughter's life.
You're really our savior

645
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:33,910
Thanks for saving my life

646
01:13:33,952 --> 01:13:36,246
Feel free to accept it

647
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:48,591
I've said

648
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:50,135
I'm even able to

649
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:52,095
kill that monk

650
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:12,115
He attacked

651
01:14:12,157 --> 01:14:13,158
Wukong

652
01:14:13,825 --> 01:14:14,826
Why did you do this?

653
01:14:14,868 --> 01:14:15,910
She's a demon

654
01:14:16,411 --> 01:14:18,580
So is everyone in
your eyes a demon?

655
01:14:19,456 --> 01:14:21,332
Bad guy

656
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:22,625
Morn

657
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:24,252
Are you okay, sweetheart

658
01:14:24,294 --> 01:14:25,295
Are you alright?

659
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:27,130
Please quiet down! Easy!

660
01:14:27,172 --> 01:14:29,132
Calm down. Be quiet

661
01:14:29,174 --> 01:14:29,841
Baddie

662
01:14:29,883 --> 01:14:31,885
What's wrong with you?

663
01:14:33,303 --> 01:14:36,681
You hurt my daughter.
I won't forgive you

664
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:03,374
Bro Bajie

665
01:15:20,475 --> 01:15:23,937
Morn...

666
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:28,274
Holy monk, help

667
01:15:31,611 --> 01:15:34,864
Holy monk, help me

668
01:15:59,973 --> 01:16:01,558
Master, stop chanting

669
01:16:01,599 --> 01:16:03,560
Master, he knows
he's in the wrong

670
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:04,811
Yeah

671
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:17,699
Help me...

672
01:16:45,018 --> 01:16:47,854
Holy monk, help

673
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:37,445
Wukong

674
01:17:39,489 --> 01:17:40,698
Just leave

675
01:17:42,116 --> 01:17:45,244
Master, this girl
doesn't look ordinary

676
01:17:45,787 --> 01:17:47,372
You can't let him leave

677
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:51,167
Yes, Master. He
suddenly did that

678
01:17:51,668 --> 01:17:53,336
There must be a reason

679
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:56,130
Monk

680
01:17:56,172 --> 01:17:58,091
they have turned from monsters

681
01:17:59,509 --> 01:18:01,803
It's just that you
can't see them through

682
01:18:03,805 --> 01:18:06,849
My duty is to escort
you to the West

683
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:08,351
Escorting me

684
01:18:09,644 --> 01:18:13,106
is not the reason that
you can kill willfully

685
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:15,108
In order to escort me

686
01:18:16,526 --> 01:18:18,528
you don't even spare
a little girl

687
01:18:19,779 --> 01:18:21,489
Do you fear I would die

688
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,784
or I would not make
it to the West

689
01:18:24,826 --> 01:18:26,452
to remove this hoop for you?

690
01:18:32,542 --> 01:18:34,794
The problem is not with
the hoop on your head

691
01:18:36,087 --> 01:18:38,673
but the hoop in your heart

692
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:47,765
You can only rely on yourself

693
01:18:49,308 --> 01:18:50,935
There's nothing I could do

694
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:53,771
Thought it over?

695
01:18:57,567 --> 01:18:58,943
Just leave

696
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:01,154
Master

697
01:19:15,877 --> 01:19:20,006
Our karma ends here.
Don't kneel to me

698
01:19:34,896 --> 01:19:36,272
You...

699
01:19:49,911 --> 01:19:51,204
Leave!

700
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:10,389
Bajie

701
01:20:14,018 --> 01:20:15,144
Bro Sha

702
01:20:15,686 --> 01:20:16,854
Big brother

703
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:20,817
The road ahead is dangerous

704
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:23,694
Do your best to protect him

705
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:29,700
I'm leaving

706
01:20:31,577 --> 01:20:33,830
- Big brother - Big brother

707
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:37,750
Big brother!

708
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:34,932
- Master!
- Master!

709
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:50,072
Bro Bajie

710
01:21:50,114 --> 01:21:52,825
Master is kidnapped!

711
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,371
Thank you

712
01:21:57,413 --> 01:21:58,414
If you don't tell me

713
01:21:58,456 --> 01:22:00,666
I really have no idea
he's been kidnapped

714
01:22:02,335 --> 01:22:04,879
Now what shall we do?

715
01:22:04,921 --> 01:22:06,422
Bro Sha

716
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:08,341
Now things go really bad

717
01:22:08,382 --> 01:22:10,885
There are only three
options for us

718
01:22:10,927 --> 01:22:12,428
Option One

719
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:14,805
Go to big brother's home
mountain and bring him back

720
01:22:14,847 --> 01:22:16,265
Oh yeah!

721
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:19,143
Option Two

722
01:22:19,185 --> 01:22:23,147
Go to Moon Waters Cave and
harass them to buy time for us

723
01:22:23,189 --> 01:22:24,273
Excellent!

724
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:25,816
What about Three?

725
01:22:25,858 --> 01:22:28,986
Option Three is relatively complex.
Just try to figure it out

726
01:22:29,028 --> 01:22:33,032
That is, you go to the Cave
to buy time for yourself

727
01:22:33,074 --> 01:22:35,284
And it's still you to go
to big brother's place

728
01:22:37,745 --> 01:22:38,871
Are you going too?

729
01:22:38,913 --> 01:22:40,831
Don't ask anything nonsense

730
01:22:40,873 --> 01:22:42,833
We still have the last resort

731
01:22:44,377 --> 01:22:47,630
The burdens are yours.
The dragon horse is mine

732
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:50,549
Let's disband

733
01:22:57,598 --> 01:22:58,641
Yeah

734
01:23:00,017 --> 01:23:01,978
Why didn't it come to my mind?

735
01:23:03,521 --> 01:23:05,064
Because you're an idiot

736
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:13,990
Why didn't it come to my mind?

737
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:15,116
You are...

738
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:18,828
an unsympathetic,
unfaithful jerk!

739
01:23:22,456 --> 01:23:24,542
- I've long been putting up with you
- You!

740
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:30,589
It hurts?

741
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:31,716
Yes!

742
01:23:34,635 --> 01:23:37,722
Bro Sha, hit his face! His face!

743
01:24:19,138 --> 01:24:20,598
The horse is yours

744
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:34,070
Dragon Horse, let's
go to save Master

745
01:25:05,726 --> 01:25:09,230
What exactly are you
doing this for?

746
01:25:10,231 --> 01:25:11,857
Are you curious?

747
01:25:14,568 --> 01:25:19,782
Because if I eat you, I can
become an immortal demon

748
01:25:20,491 --> 01:25:24,495
I want no reincarnation.
I hate being a human

749
01:25:25,121 --> 01:25:26,664
In this case

750
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:30,584
what happened in
your previous life?

751
01:25:31,168 --> 01:25:33,337
Speaking of it...

752
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:46,016
the villagers said

753
01:25:46,851 --> 01:25:49,478
I brought on the disaster
to their village

754
01:25:51,438 --> 01:25:53,190
I was seen as a demon

755
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:57,903
That's just a story
about my previous life

756
01:25:59,029 --> 01:26:00,573
It's a true story

757
01:26:02,032 --> 01:26:05,995
Don't think you're different

758
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:11,333
from those who had left
me on the lone cliff

759
01:26:12,835 --> 01:26:17,006
You immortals are just merciless

760
01:26:18,591 --> 01:26:20,301
I hate you all

761
01:26:21,594 --> 01:26:22,845
Hatred

762
01:26:23,721 --> 01:26:25,389
can only give birth to hatred

763
01:26:29,393 --> 01:26:31,562
Why must you be so
hard on yourself?

764
01:26:31,604 --> 01:26:33,606
Stop enlightening me

765
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:37,651
Listen

766
01:26:38,444 --> 01:26:41,780
your enlightenment
is of no use at all

767
01:27:11,644 --> 01:27:16,565
Goddess. Why are you in my
way back to my mountain?

768
01:27:17,942 --> 01:27:21,654
Wukong. Even if you get
back to your place today

769
01:27:22,363 --> 01:27:25,199
that is not your
final destination

770
01:27:25,241 --> 01:27:26,784
Then can you tell me

771
01:27:27,785 --> 01:27:29,370
where else I can go?

772
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:33,874
Big brother, do you know that

773
01:27:33,916 --> 01:27:35,542
Master was snatched
by the monster

774
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:37,294
Big brother

775
01:27:39,213 --> 01:27:40,547
Don't be afraid, everyone

776
01:27:40,589 --> 01:27:42,299
I'm here for your lord

777
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:47,596
Only you can save
Master, Big brother

778
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:51,809
You don't know any better

779
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:53,686
Can't you just put
up a bit with him?

780
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:55,562
Look how young he is

781
01:27:55,604 --> 01:27:57,773
and how old you are, huh?

782
01:28:00,818 --> 01:28:02,528
Look, Big brother

783
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:11,704
A branch can be...

784
01:28:13,163 --> 01:28:14,665
easily snapped...

785
01:28:18,877 --> 01:28:21,213
snapped without effort

786
01:28:21,255 --> 01:28:24,508
while ten branches are
unbreakable together

787
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:28,178
If the four of us are
united and bound

788
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:29,930
we will reach the West and

789
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:32,308
fetch the scripture for sure

790
01:28:32,349 --> 01:28:34,018
He's not here

791
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:37,980
Why didn't you tell earlier?

792
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:41,984
What shall I do?

793
01:28:42,026 --> 01:28:44,445
You tell me!

794
01:30:48,026 --> 01:30:49,611
Big brother!

795
01:30:54,283 --> 01:30:55,451
Hey. look!

796
01:30:56,368 --> 01:30:57,870
Idiot!

797
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:05,961
I need Big brother's suit
of armor to give me courage

798
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:28,400
Wukong

799
01:31:28,942 --> 01:31:31,111
Golden Cicada has waited
for nine lifetimes

800
01:31:31,153 --> 01:31:34,823
before you're available to
be his disciple in this life

801
01:31:34,865 --> 01:31:36,950
and you'll be rectified
and led to Buddhism

802
01:31:37,826 --> 01:31:39,620
But the monk of this life

803
01:31:40,787 --> 01:31:42,372
has abandoned me

804
01:31:43,373 --> 01:31:45,083
Am I at fault?

805
01:31:45,125 --> 01:31:48,921
Wukong, in fact, you
abandoned your master

806
01:31:49,630 --> 01:31:52,007
500 years ago, you
trusted yourself,

807
01:31:52,049 --> 01:31:53,884
so you wreaked havoc in heaven

808
01:31:53,926 --> 01:31:56,845
But now, you haven't
changed in any way

809
01:31:58,096 --> 01:32:01,475
Why don't you trust others
rather than yourself?

810
01:32:02,226 --> 01:32:04,853
You have always been
judging others with

811
01:32:04,895 --> 01:32:07,105
your own standard
of right or wrong

812
01:32:07,981 --> 01:32:10,734
What your Fiery
Eyes see is truth

813
01:32:10,776 --> 01:32:13,904
but what your master
sees is heart

814
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:19,326
Wukong, your master's
life is at risk

815
01:32:19,743 --> 01:32:22,788
This is when he needs you most

816
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:28,544
Time is up

817
01:32:30,337 --> 01:32:34,007
How about you enlighten
me in your next lifetime?

818
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:36,885
I'll still be
waiting here, okay?

819
01:32:50,357 --> 01:32:52,109
I hope my death

820
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:57,406
can take away your stubbornness

821
01:33:57,299 --> 01:33:58,634
Who is it?

822
01:34:01,678 --> 01:34:05,265
What happened? Can
anyone tell me?

823
01:35:33,603 --> 01:35:35,063
Evil monkey!

824
01:37:11,451 --> 01:37:12,744
Master

825
01:37:13,453 --> 01:37:14,996
I'm back

826
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:18,250
Wukong

827
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:28,385
Move!

828
01:37:55,829 --> 01:37:57,205
Bro Sha, you go!

829
01:38:04,337 --> 01:38:06,089
Let me get even...

830
01:38:24,733 --> 01:38:25,817
Move!

831
01:39:49,484 --> 01:39:50,694
Master

832
01:39:55,115 --> 01:39:57,075
Since the Buddha entrusts
you with the scriptures

833
01:39:57,117 --> 01:39:58,493
I won't let you die

834
01:39:59,119 --> 01:40:00,370
Hold on

835
01:41:35,298 --> 01:41:36,216
Enlarge!

836
01:42:47,954 --> 01:42:49,372
White Bone Spirit

837
01:42:50,206 --> 01:42:52,625
this is your doom
of the millennium

838
01:42:52,667 --> 01:42:55,295
Now your spirit will vanish

839
01:42:55,795 --> 01:42:57,630
forever and ever

840
01:43:03,136 --> 01:43:04,512
Buddha

841
01:43:05,054 --> 01:43:08,016
I'm willing to help
her overcome her doom

842
01:43:08,850 --> 01:43:12,520
Please give her a chance

843
01:43:13,855 --> 01:43:17,317
Xuanzang, if you
want to save her

844
01:43:17,358 --> 01:43:20,528
the only way is to lead her to
her reincarnation into human

845
01:43:21,196 --> 01:43:23,156
But, as you're a mortal

846
01:43:23,198 --> 01:43:26,993
you have to give up
your life to do that

847
01:43:27,035 --> 01:43:28,870
Do you really want to?

848
01:43:30,872 --> 01:43:33,333
Yes, do

849
01:44:04,030 --> 01:44:07,909
Do you think you're saving me?

850
01:44:09,702 --> 01:44:11,579
As long as there
is a gleam of hope

851
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:15,166
I won't give up by any means

852
01:44:15,208 --> 01:44:18,962
Whatever the result is, I'm willing
to go on this trip with you

853
01:44:24,175 --> 01:44:26,135
It's been a thousand years

854
01:44:28,221 --> 01:44:30,098
I'm used to being a demon

855
01:44:46,948 --> 01:44:49,284
When I was 16

856
01:44:52,704 --> 01:44:54,038
they said

857
01:44:55,290 --> 01:44:57,083
I'm an evil demon

858
01:45:01,212 --> 01:45:03,339
No! Don't!

859
01:45:26,362 --> 01:45:27,780
You're not gonna make it

860
01:45:31,868 --> 01:45:33,244
Wukong

861
01:45:34,329 --> 01:45:35,913
Lady White

862
01:45:36,247 --> 01:45:38,624
wants to meet her
end within my body

863
01:45:39,334 --> 01:45:41,169
If I don't lead her
to her reincarnation

864
01:45:41,669 --> 01:45:43,504
she'll vanish completely

865
01:45:48,509 --> 01:45:50,553
Will you trust me?

866
01:45:51,429 --> 01:45:54,557
I only trust you alone

867
01:45:55,725 --> 01:45:57,268
from now on

868
01:46:00,104 --> 01:46:01,856
Kill me

869
01:46:04,067 --> 01:46:05,318
No

870
01:46:06,986 --> 01:46:08,237
No way!

871
01:46:09,113 --> 01:46:10,531
Wukong

872
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:14,160
At first I thought

873
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:17,455
To enlighten people

874
01:46:18,873 --> 01:46:21,042
is just to educate them by words

875
01:46:22,794 --> 01:46:24,545
Only now do I see

876
01:46:26,631 --> 01:46:28,383
if I don't get in hell

877
01:46:29,634 --> 01:46:32,303
even if I could reach
the Thunder Monastery

878
01:46:33,221 --> 01:46:34,931
I would not get the scriptures

879
01:46:40,603 --> 01:46:42,313
Now I've decided

880
01:46:45,066 --> 01:46:46,651
If she can't change her doom

881
01:46:47,402 --> 01:46:48,986
I'll help her
throughout this life

882
01:46:49,821 --> 01:46:51,656
If not so after ten lifetimes

883
01:46:52,824 --> 01:46:55,159
I'll be helping as
well, without fail

884
01:47:00,081 --> 01:47:01,290
Alright

885
01:47:07,672 --> 01:47:09,507
On the way of 36,000 miles

886
01:47:10,675 --> 01:47:14,429
I'm waiting for your return

887
01:47:16,264 --> 01:47:17,932
If you can't come
back for a lifetime

888
01:47:18,558 --> 01:47:20,601
I'll wait throughout this life

889
01:47:22,812 --> 01:47:24,689
If not so after ten lifetimes

890
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:27,984
I'll be waiting as
well, without fail

891
01:47:31,362 --> 01:47:32,738
Alright

892
01:47:49,547 --> 01:47:50,923
Come on

893
01:48:30,296 --> 01:48:31,589
Big brother

894
01:48:32,590 --> 01:48:34,258
You mustn't do this!

895
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:36,969
No, big brother. Don't do this!

896
01:48:39,555 --> 01:48:43,184
If I have this good fortune

897
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:45,853
next lifetime

898
01:48:48,356 --> 01:48:50,900
I still want to be your master

899
01:48:52,068 --> 01:48:53,819
Master

900
01:49:33,401 --> 01:49:36,529
This is where I
have to say goodbye

901
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:24,368
Master

902
01:50:26,412 --> 01:50:27,830
Master

903
01:50:44,722 --> 01:50:47,683
Big brother. It's
been seven days

904
01:50:47,725 --> 01:50:49,644
Why hasn't Master's
soul returned yet?

905
01:50:49,685 --> 01:50:51,729
At this rate, let's disband

906
01:50:54,065 --> 01:50:56,192
No more "disband". Got it?

907
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:59,487
Are we still going
or not, Big brother?

908
01:51:05,826 --> 01:51:07,536
As long as Master's
golden body is intact

909
01:51:07,953 --> 01:51:09,664
I'll carry his body

910
01:51:10,164 --> 01:51:11,832
to the Thunder Monastery

911
01:51:12,667 --> 01:51:14,251
to see the Buddha in person

912
01:51:42,029 --> 01:51:43,989
Master, let's go!

913
01:51:56,502 --> 01:51:59,588
Oh, my brother. I'm hungry.
What to do?

914
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:01,424
I can't stay hungry!

915
01:52:01,799 --> 01:52:03,342
You only know eating

916
01:52:04,051 --> 01:52:05,177
Yeah,yeah“.

917
01:52:05,219 --> 01:52:07,555
Let's eat hot pot!
