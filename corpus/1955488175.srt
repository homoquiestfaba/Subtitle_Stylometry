1
00:00:01,618 --> 00:00:05,538
Hey. -Hey. -Mike, guess
what I got behind my back.

2
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:09,742
Do I have to? -Oh,
yeah. -A cello? -No.

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:13,546
What do you know? Where'd
you find that? -In the back.

4
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:17,133
I've been looking for this thing ever
since I bought the place. -What is it?

5
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:19,636
It's my old lucky ball.
-It's his old fruity ball.

6
00:00:19,736 --> 00:00:21,321
I used to bowl with this
thing when I was a kid.

7
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,356
That's sweet. That is sweet.

8
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:26,343
It is very sweet. Very sweet
indeed that Ed Stevens used

9
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,529
to bowl with a woman's ball.
-It's not a woman's ball.

10
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:33,767
Why, just 'cause it's pink?
-The engraving on the ball says

11
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,137
"Fran Jesperson." Fran.
-We agreed long ago

12
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:40,540
that the name Fran was gender
ambiguous. (<i> applause</i> )

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,142
You're gender ambiguous.

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,066
Hey, Phil, what's going on?

15
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:54,204
Our young Lothario here has
vowed to ask his paramour

16
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:58,591
for her hand in marriage if and only
if he bowls a strike on this next ball.

17
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:01,695
Really? -That is so romantic.

18
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,447
Ed, you know what
you should do? -What?

19
00:01:04,547 --> 00:01:06,800
Lend him your ball. You
know, for a little Lady Luck.

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,639
Emphasis on "Lady." -Excuse
me. Wait. Excuse me. -Hi.

21
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,643
I'm Ed Stevens. I own Stuckey
Bowl. -Hi. I'm Ari. Nice lanes.

22
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:22,983
Appreciate that. Look,
this here's my lucky ball.

23
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:28,420
So if you'd like to
use it, it's all yours.

24
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,781
Okay, cool. Thanks.

25
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,368
(<i> laughs</i> )

26
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,247
Oh, my God, he's
really going to do it.

27
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,819
It's got to be some kind of joke.

You can't get married
because you bowl a strike.

48
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,913
Will you please agree with me?

49
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,273
I agree with you.

50
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,135
Okay, then.

51
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:41,588
WARREN: I'm going to tell
you a little something.

52
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,257
To please a woman, one
must employ a skillful blend

53
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,642
of tenderness and raw power.

54
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:47,227
Cheswick, it's been three weeks

55
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,978
since you were up on that mountain

56
00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:50,146
with Donna Totsie.

57
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:52,098
I'm getting sick
of hearing about it.

58
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,601
Ah, Mark, my fine, virginous friend.

59
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,769
Yeah, jealousy doesn't suit you.

60
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,772
My guess is, you didn't
lay a hand on her.

61
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,274
(<i> laughing</i> )

62
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,693
Well, unfortunately, I'm
too much the gentleman

63
00:04:03,793 --> 00:04:05,662
to convey the details
of my interlude

64
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:07,914
although I will let
on that I experimented

65
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,115
with certain maneuvers

66
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,284
heretofore attempted
only in the Orient.

67
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,619
Yeah, one-man maneuvers.

68
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,786
Once on HBO

69
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:17,723
I saw a woman who had
a 90-minute orgasm.

70
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:18,958
MARK: Oh, lookey, lookey.

71
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,476
Here's your little friend now.

72
00:04:20,576 --> 00:04:23,229
WARREN: Ah, I had a feeling
we might run into her here.

73
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,714
What, she didn't call you last night

74
00:04:24,814 --> 00:04:26,349
to tell you where
she was going to be?

75
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:28,268
No, it's not that kind
of relationship, okay?

76
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,853
Now you-you guys
just try to act cool

77
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:31,271
for once in your life, all right?

78
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,439
(<i> sighs</i> )

79
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,625
Hey, Donna.

00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:36,960
(<i> clicks tongue</i> ) Hi.

81
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,778
(<i> laughing</i> )

82
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,947
MARK: She's probably
still shuddering

83
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,916
from the tenderness of your touch.

84
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,083
Shut up.

85
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,443
(<i> chuckling</i> )

86
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,122
Mr. Stevens.

87
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,456
Yeah.

88
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,675
Could you put these
shoes in a safe place

89
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:53,693
till the wedding?

90
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,695
Yeah.

91
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,247
So, you guys are really thinking

92
00:04:57,347 --> 00:04:59,032
about going through with this, huh?

93
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,250
I bowled a strike.

94
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,417
Yeah.

95
00:05:01,517 --> 00:05:02,752
It's fate.

96
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:04,170
Can't turn your back on fate.

97
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,505
(<i> chuckling</i> )

98
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,640
Fate, well, I mean...
wh-wh-what if I...

99
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,976
what if I took this
coin, and I flipped it

100
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,778
and I said, "If it comes up heads

101
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,780
then you shouldn't get married"?

102
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,748
Okay, but you know what I mean.

103
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:16,950
How old are you guys?

104
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,368
We're 22.

105
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:20,403
ED: How long have
you known one another?

106
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:22,388
BARBARA: Six months.

107
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:26,758
Yeah... look, Ari, Barbara...
I-I'm just a guy, okay?

108
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,261
Just a guy named Ed.

109
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,597
I'm just a guy named Ed
who happens to be a lawyer.

110
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,899
I'm just a guy named Ed
who happens to be a lawyer

111
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,334
happens to run a bowling alley.

112
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,802
I'm just a guy named Ed... Ed.

113
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:36,970
What?

114
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,238
Right. Don't do this.

115
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,739
Don't get married

116
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,307
because you happened
to bowl a strike, okay?

117
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:43,860
Get married because you've spent
a lot of time with one another.

118
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,278
You've gotten to know one another.

119
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,080
Get married because
you're absolutely positive

120
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,449
that you're meant to spend
the rest of your life together.

121
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:53,586
You get married because the thought
of living without one another

122
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,922
is absolutely unbearable.
Get married for these reasons.

123
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,358
Okay, not because
you bowled a strike.

124
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:08,200
Do you understand
what I'm saying? -Yes.

125
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:11,337
Okay. ARI: But you're
forgetting something.

126
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:15,457
What's that? -I bowled a strike.

127
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,312
Excuse me.

128
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,162
Will you folks be
needing a<i> huppa?</i>

129
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,491
Okay, before we finish up today
we need a new literary quote

130

of the week for our board.

131
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,329
Anyone?

132
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,997
Come on.

133
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,383
Anything based on any of the reading

134
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,235
that we've done this year.

135
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:45,871
No?

136
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,207
Mr. Vanacore, how about you?

137
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:52,390
You have yet to grace us
with a quote of the week.

138
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,376
Mark?

139
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,722
"Just do it"?

140

(<i> laughter</i> )

141
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:07,193
Not exactly what I was
looking for, but not bad

142
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,553
under pressure.

143
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:18,054
Ms. Vesey, excellent
lesson plan today.

144
00:07:18,154 --> 00:07:19,672
It was organized, concise

145
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,892
and you're really starting
to come into your own.

146
00:07:22,992 --> 00:07:24,394
Thank you very much, Warren.

147
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:25,728
Yeah, so, listen

148
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:30,982
you know how, um, like,
I'm a great lover, right?

149
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,685
Pardon me?

150
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,806
I'm just saying that
you probably just assumed

151
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:38,891
based on the way I comport myself.

152
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,227
I'm going to agree
because I feel that

153
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:44,263
that will make this
conversation end more quickly.

154
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:48,550
Right. Uh... so,
there's this girl...

155
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:49,836
Donna Totsie.

156
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:50,970
Whoa.

157
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,605
How do you do that?

158
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,108
You're like Kreskin or something.

159
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,743
It's like I'm sitting here naked.

160
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:57,910
Warren, I'm not blind.

161
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,662
I heard about your little weekend

162
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:00,913
up on the mountain.

163
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,483
Yeah, well, I... I
think I blew it with her.

164
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,843
Why is that?

165
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,555
The window closed on me, Ms. Vesey.

166
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,741
The-the window?

167
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:12,725
Of opportunity.

168
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,210
The window of opportunity.

169
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,463
I was up on the mountain, and
it was open, and I<i> choked.</i>

170
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:18,731
I blew it.

171
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:19,916
You're going to have to give me

172
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:21,067
a little more to go on here.

173
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,286
Well, what I'm trying to say is...

174
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:25,221
nothing happened.

175
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:27,223
See, I...

176
00:08:27,323 --> 00:08:29,225
We didn't even kiss or anything.

177
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:31,244
It's, like, all we did was talk

178
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,412
and stuff.

179
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,713
What's wrong with talking?

180
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,398
No. Oh, you don't understand.

181
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:37,266
Nothing. Nothing's
wrong with talking.

182
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:40,803
Talking is great.

183
00:08:40,903 --> 00:08:42,755
I mean, but like... I mean,
after you talk you got to, like

184
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:48,628
start kissing and stuff, or else...
that's when the window closes, you see?

185
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,680
And once the window
closes, that's it!

186
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,517
I mean, it's never going
to open up again. -I see.

187
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,537
Yesterday, I ran into her,
and she just, like, dusted me.

188
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,372
She just, like, walked right by me.

189
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,756
I was, like, "What's up?"

190
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:02,008
Warren

191
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:05,244
did it ever occur to
you that she's worried

192
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:08,964
her window of opportunity
with<i> you</i> has closed?

193
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,202
Whoa.

194
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,562
(<i> gasps</i> )

195
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,558
(<i> knocking</i> )

196
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:19,725
Yeah.

197
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:20,893
Ed Stevens?

198
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,228
Yeah.

199
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,664
Jamie Masters.

200
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:26,599
Hey.

201
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,534
Uh, Twizzler?

202
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,336
Uh, no, thanks, I-I'm good.

203
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,337
Oh.

204
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:32,338
(<i> both chuckling</i> )

205
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:33,372
Can I help you

206
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:34,674
with something, Mr. Masters?

207
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,709
Oh, I-I need to get
a restraining order

208
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:37,810
against my brother.

209
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,779
Oh. Sure. Have a seat.

210
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,581
So, what seems to be the problem?

211
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,583
He's ruining my life.

212
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,084
How so?

213
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,420
Ed, I have a weight problem.

214
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,854
Oh, I-I mean, I don't...

215
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,491
Come on, I'm a fat guy.

216
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,825
Okay.

217
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,527
Now I've been on every
diet known to man.

218
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:58,164
Fiber bars, breakfast shakes,
liquid protein low carbs, high carbs.

219
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,734
I've tried it all.
Never any luck. -Well...

220
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:04,921
losing weight can be difficult. -So, a
couple of months ago, my doc tells me

221
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,974
I'm one burrito away from
exploding. -Really? He said that?

222
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:11,711
Ah, not exactly. I'm being colorful.
-I see. -But I get his point.

223
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,830
You know, if I don't turn it
around, it's bye-bye, Birdie.

224
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,449
Well, how does this
involve your brother?

225
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,952
Well, I'm upset, so I go to my brother
Steve and I give him carte blanche.

226
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:23,206
Carte blanche? -I told him
that until I lose 30 pounds

227
00:10:23,306 --> 00:10:26,976
he has carte blanche to do anything
he wants to stop me from eating badly.

228
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:30,463
What does that mean exactly?
-I told him even if I change my mind

229
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:34,684
even if I beg him to leave me alone,
don't stop. My life's at stake.

230
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:37,019
You know, he has to do
whatever he needs to do

231
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:41,040
to prevent me from eating badly.
-So, why the restraining order?

232
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,042
Well, the whole thing's
gotten out of hand.

233
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:47,330
It started with a polite
reminder, then... Oh, my God.

234
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,583
He followed me here. -Followed you
here to see if you'd eat a Twizzler?

235
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,551
He's got a baseball bat!

236
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,249
Quick for a big guy.

237
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,596
JAMIE: Wait!

238
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,399
Stop! That's my brand-new Taurus!

239
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,100
You like Twizzlers, Jamie, huh?

240
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:15,373
Go ahead, eat 'em up! JAMIE:
I-I'm throwing them out. Okay?

241
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,009
Too little, too late, tubby, huh?

242
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:23,665
I've got a very interesting job.

243
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:32,391
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Mr. Masters? Steve Masters?

244
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,645
You're the guy from the bowling
alley. -Yeah, Ed Stevens.

245
00:11:35,745 --> 00:11:39,231
I'm, uh, your brother,
Jamie's attorney, actually.

246
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:42,602
He got a lawyer? -Yeah. -Why?

247
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,604
Because you smashed up his
car, among other things.

248
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,238
Look, I know Jamie
asked you for help

249
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,207
losing weight, but you're
taking things too far.

250
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,609
You've got to stop doing this stuff.

251
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,327
I've got to stop doing this stuff?

252
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:53,913
Look, my brother's standing
at a fork in the road.

253
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,681
Either he loses weight or he dies.

254
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,017
And I'll tell you this,
he's not dying on my watch.

255
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,453
Okay, but do you think you
can come up with something

256
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,823
a little more productive than humiliating
him and destroying his property?

257
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,124
Hey, he asked me to do this.

258
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,126
He made me promise to do this

259
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,729
and I intend to live
up to my promise.

260
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,697
Look, no matter how good
your intentions may be

261
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,199
what you're doing is still illegal.

262
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,701
If you don't stop, I'm going
to have to take you to court.

263
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:19,905
Illegal? -Yeah. -I don't think
it's illegal. -Sure, it is.

264
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:23,643
I have a signed contract from
Jamie. -What? -That's right.

265
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:28,097
I'd be happy to send you a copy.
Spells it all out in black and white.

266
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:31,250
Jamie has given me the
legal right to do anything

267
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,153
and everything to stop
him from overeating.

268
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,455
It stipulates the
contract remains valid

269
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,816
even if he changes his mind.

270
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,822
Huh.

271
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,425
How can you say that Jim
Morrison was not a poet?

272
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,178
I didn't say that, Mark.
I didn't say that.

273
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,681
What I said was that
when I assign you

274
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,685
to memorize a classic American
poem you can't just walk in here

275
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,588
and recite "Riders on
the Storm." -Why not?

276
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,124
It's beautiful.
(<i> bell rings</i> )

277
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:15,161
Okay, Lizard King.
That's all for today.

278
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:18,530
Class dismissed.

279
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,468

280
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,937
Hey, Donna. -Yeah?

281
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:28,224
Hey, I was, I was, like, curious
about something. -What's that?

282
00:13:28,324 --> 00:13:30,142
Well, I just wanted
to ask you a question.

283
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,611
I just... bounce an
idea off you. -Okay.

284
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:36,414
Whenever you have
the time. -Go ahead.

285
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:42,505
'Cause I-I could-- we could-- set
something up or... Okay, uh... sorry.

286
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:45,224
Okay, um, I was just thinking
if you were interested in...

287
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,409
Hey, Warren.

288
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:47,827
Oh, hey, Jess!

289
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,862
Hey, wow, uh...

290
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:53,282
oh... Jess, this is, um...

291
00:13:53,382 --> 00:13:56,367
Donna.

292
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,704
Yeah, we know each other.

293
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,006
Oh...

294
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:02,608
Linda told me you really did spend

295
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,276
that weekend up on the precipice.

296
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:05,444
Yes. That's pretty cool.

297
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:06,762
Cool, yeah.

298
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:09,515
Uh, I suppose you
could say it was cool.

299
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,685
But, um, for me the
word that springs to mind

300
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:13,853
is "epiphanous."

301
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,321
What do you mean?

302
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:20,158
Jessica, as I stood
atop that mountain

303
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,395
with the majesty of
God's creation at my feet

304
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,064
life's biggest questions suddenly

305
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,766
made their answers known unto me.

306
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,501
Like, what questions?

307
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,736
Like, "Who are you?" I mean, I know

308
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,772
I know you're Jessica Martell

309
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,356
but, like, who are you?

310
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,542
I don't know.

311
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,477
Exactly. Exactly. That's it.

312
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:39,478
And I do know.

313
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:40,463
So, who are you?

314
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:41,580
Who am I?

315
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,598
Mm-hmm.

316
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:44,049
I'm Warren Cheswick.

317
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,101
But not just Warren Cheswick.

318
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:47,620
I'm<i> Warren Cheswick.</i>

319
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,737
You know?

320
00:14:48,837 --> 00:14:50,022
Well, that's, that's awesome.

321
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,290
It was awesome.

322
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,292
It was intense.

323
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,262
Well, I got to go to French class.

324
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,463
Okay.

325
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,547
I'll see you later.

326
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,049
Yeah, catch you later.

327
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,234
So, I...

328
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,525
The window...

329
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,910
it is closed.

330
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,950
Oh...

331
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:22,037
Now, Mr. Stevens, perhaps
your client ought to explain

332
00:15:22,137 --> 00:15:23,539
what his brother has done

333
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,875
to necessitate this
restraining order.

334
00:15:25,975 --> 00:15:27,560
Oh, of course. Go ahead, Jamie.

335
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,612
Thanks, Your Honor.

336
00:15:29,712 --> 00:15:32,114
(<i> clears throat</i> )

337
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:34,200
January 10, I ate a Pop Tart.

338
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,487
Steve flushes my best pair of
dress socks down the toilet.

339
00:15:38,587 --> 00:15:40,639
January 16...

340
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,241
I eat a slice of pizza.

341
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:45,294
Steve spray-paints the
words "Captain Tubby"

342
00:15:45,394 --> 00:15:46,512
on my front door.

343
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,963
January 21, I consume

344
00:15:48,063 --> 00:15:51,100
a few too many individual
servings of pudding

345
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,552
and Steve burns my entire collection

346
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,721
of Jack London first editions.

347
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,890
Good-bye,<i> Call</i>
<i> of the Wild.</i>

348
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,391
Adios,<i> White Fang.</i>

349
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,493
Please, lower your voice, huh?

350
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,212
I'm sorry.

351
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:06,215
February 3, I take one
bite out of a pound cake--

352
00:16:06,315 --> 00:16:08,517
one bite, so help
me God, Your Honor.

353
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:12,471
Steve calls the guy who works
in the cubicle next to me

354
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:16,474
imitates my voice and
asks him out on a date.

355
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,110
February 9...

356
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,880
Oh, that's enough. Thank
you, uh, Mr. Masters.

357
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,748
Have you exhausted
all non-legal methods

358
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,650
to stop your brother
from harassing you?

359
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,119
I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.

360
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,722
Yeah, all right.

361
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,758
Uh... I'm going to issue a restraining
order effective immediately.

362
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,510
Thanks, Your Honor.

363
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,870
Thank you.

364
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,499
Come on. Hug the fat guy.

365
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,143
How are the wedding plans going?

366
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,961
All according to schedule.

367
00:16:54,963 --> 00:16:57,366
When did you become the sworn enemy
of crazy, romantic spontaneity?

368
00:16:57,466 --> 00:16:58,984
I thought that was your, your deal.

369
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:01,120
It is, I just want the both
of them to wait, you know?

370
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,489
At least until they're sure
they were meant to be together.

371
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,457
I don't want them to make
the same mistake I did.

372
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:06,458
Marrying Liz?

373
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:07,660
Yeah.

374
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,244
How did you guys end
up together, anyway?

375
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:10,829
She was my dental hygienist.

376
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,414
We fell in love while
she was showing me

377
00:17:12,514 --> 00:17:13,632
the proper flossing technique.

378
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,384
Seriously? No.

379
00:17:15,484 --> 00:17:17,836
I just didn't want to deprive you
of the super cute meeting story.

380
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:20,806
No, she was, uh, she was friends with
Bruce Cawhill, my law school roommate

381
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:21,924
and he set us up.

382
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:23,392
The minute we laid
eyes on one another

383
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:25,260
it was, like... boom!

384
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,679
Really?

385
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,014
Yeah, we had one of those
first dates where you end up

386
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,417
staying up all night, staring
into one another's eyes.

387
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,518
Mmm.

388
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,236
Four months later, we were engaged.

389
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:35,270
Four months?

390
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,271
Yeah.

391
00:17:36,371 --> 00:17:37,489
Wow! Four--
I had no idea.

392
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:38,774
Yeah, it took another three years

393
00:17:38,874 --> 00:17:40,359
before we knew each
other well enough

394
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,244
to realize we didn't
belong together.

395
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:44,496
I don't want these kids to make
the same mistake, that's all.

396
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,965
Look, I can see
that you have a point

397
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,433
but what if you're wrong?

398
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,768
What if Barbara and Ari are
actually perfect for each other

399
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,603
and they're supposed to
live happily ever after?

400
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:54,006
If I'm wrong, they can wait a
couple years, then get married.

401
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,574
Yeah, but sometimes in relationships

402
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,376
there's this, this
window of opportunity.

403
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,944
And, and if you miss it...

404
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,413
Eddie! ED: Hey.

405
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,582
Jamie.

406
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,084
Jamie Masters, Carol Vessey.

407
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:06,552
Carol Vessey, Jamie Masters.

408
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,553
Hi.

409
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,404
Hi. Nice to meet you.

410
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,091
You gave me my life back.

411
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,425
See, there comes a point in time

412
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:16,228
when you've got to realize,
you are what you are.

413
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:17,563
I'm overweight. So what?

414
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,798
You know, there are
worse things to be.

415
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:23,168
STEVE (<i> over megaphone</i>
): Ladies and gentlemen

416
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,337
please direct your attention
to the giant fat guy

417
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,841
in the blue windbreaker.

418
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,010
My God

419
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,611
would you look at
that fat ------- eat?

420
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,346
Would you look at him?

421
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,714
Does this look like a guy

422
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,950
who needs to be
pounding down hot dogs?

423
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,319
Eat, you fat
-------, eat.

424
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:41,570
He can't do this.

425
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,906
He's violating the
restraining order.

426
00:18:44,006 --> 00:18:46,525
You're violating the
restraining order.

427
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,160
Screw the restraining order.

428
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,812
Forget the restraining order.

429
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:51,180
I'm taking him to court.

430
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,816
I want my car fixed. I
want emotional damages.

431
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,518
I want it all.

432
00:18:56,618 --> 00:18:57,436
I'm taking him to court.

433
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:58,737
I am taking him to court.

434
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:03,004
Okay, calm down, Jamie.
We'll, we'll work this out.

435
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,614
Next question

436
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,416
have you gotten your blood tests?

437
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,552
No, we were going to go to the clinic
tomorrow. -Not necessary, my friend.

438
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,822
I have an old summer camp buddy
who can take care of this for you.

439
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,758
What you're going to do is
go down to the filling station

440
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:22,428
at the corner of Forbes and Murray.

441
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:26,381
CAROL: Hey, guys. -Beep me.

442
00:19:26,481 --> 00:19:28,200
Hey. BARBARA: Hi.

443
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,402
So, guys, we have the most
perfect idea for our wedding.

444
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:34,840
What's that? -My best man's
going to be Colonel Sanders.

445
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,200
The chicken guy.

446
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:41,080
Isn't that an amazing
idea? -Wow, isn't he dead?

447
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,017
Yeah. -No, no, you're
thinking of Arthur Treacher.

448
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,252
BOTH: Oh.

449
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,687
Yeah...

450
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:51,047
Yeah, yeah. All right.

451
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,443
I don't think I can do this.
CAROL: Do what?

452
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:57,029
Participate in this
wedding. -Why not?

453
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:58,530
You hear those kids
out there? -Yeah.

454
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,583
They want Colonel Sanders to be their
best man. -Yeah. -Colonel Sanders?

455
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:04,887
So? -This is marriage
we're talking about.

456
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:06,972
They're not taking the
whole thing serious enough.

457
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,374
Marriage, the blessed union,
the sacrament, man and woman.

458
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:10,976
Do the words "Till
death do us part" ring

459
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:12,377
any bells with you?

460
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,046
Yeah, I'm so confused.

461
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,614
In marriage, you don't throw

462
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,416
a fanciful restaurant
mascot into the proceedings.

463
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:18,784
Ed? What?

464
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,919
This just doesn't sound like you.

465
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,554
Aw, I just don't want to sit idly by

466
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,640
and watch these two
kids gallop down the road

467
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,892
towards misery, that's all.

468
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,277
Colonel Stupid Sanders.

469
00:20:28,377 --> 00:20:30,629
I think that you're
missing the point here.

470
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,831
I'm missing the point?
I'm missing the point?

471
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:33,966
Yep, little bit. How?

472
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,334
What do you think the point is?

473
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,336
I think the point is,
it's not a bad thing

474
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,686
to want Colonel
Sanders at your wedding.

475
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,091
It's a bad thing if
only one of you wants

476
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:46,441
to have Colonel
Sanders at your wedding.

477
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,149
PHIL: Okay.

478
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,450
They got me.

479
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,652
I let down my guard,
and they got me.

480
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,622
I've decided to take care
of the catering F.O.C.

481
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,990
F.O.C.?

482
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,225
Free of charge.

483
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,528
And if you repeat
that, I will deny it.

484
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,947
There are reasons why
people in this town

485
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:09,964
need to think of Phil Stubbs
as a soulless merchant of fear.

486
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:13,037
Oh.

487
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,236
(<i> bell rings</i> )

488
00:21:20,963 --> 00:21:22,114
Donna, Donna.

489
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,198
Yeah?

490
00:21:23,298 --> 00:21:24,583
Hey.

491
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,619
Look, uh... what I was
going to ask you before was

492
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,979
um, will you...?

493
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,659
Here's the question.

494
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,360
Um...

495
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,195
Will I what?

496
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,166
Will you go out with
me Saturday night?

497
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,684
Okay.

498
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,820
Really?

499
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,488
Excellent.

500
00:21:46,588 --> 00:21:47,823
Oh, yes.

501
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:50,209
Okay, um... uh,
yeah. Saturday night.

502
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,210
Saturday night.

503
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,461
Okay.

504
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,962
Hey, she said...

505
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,664
Oh... hey, Donna.

506
00:21:55,764 --> 00:21:59,084
Um, just so we're clear on
this, um, when I say "go out"

507
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:02,170
I mean, like, on a date,
and not just as friends.

508
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,639
Yeah, I kind of figured.

509
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:09,728
Awesome. 'Cause, you see, my buddy,
Mark Vanacore he's got this theory

510
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,230
And he was, like, "Dude
your window's closed."

511
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,598
And I was, like, "Okay, son, look

512
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,600
I think you've been
watching a little too much

513
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,686
<i> Mars-Venus,</i>
you know. -What?

514
00:22:17,786 --> 00:22:20,606
<i> Mars-Venus,</i> it's the TV
show that dumped Cybill Shepherd.

515
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:21,773
Remember, in, like...

516
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:24,326
You're starting to lose me here.

517
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,578
8:00, Park Theater. -Okay.

518
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,613
Okay.

519
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:28,614
See you then.

520
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,215
Yeah.

521
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:45,230
Your Honor, my client Steve Masters

522
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,150
is charged with violating
a restraining order

523
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,485
that I believe should not be upheld.

524
00:22:50,585 --> 00:22:53,071
Why? Because his
so-called harassment

525
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:57,225
of his brother Jamie, comes
at Jamie's own request.

526
00:22:57,325 --> 00:23:00,644
Jamie asked Steve to sign a contract

527
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,048
promising to do whatever it took

528
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,233
to stop him from overeating.

529
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:08,654
And I quote, "no matter
how much I protest."

530
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:09,788
You see, Your Honor

531
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,890
Jamie knew there would come a time

532
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,492
when his will would weaken

533
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,460
and he would want Steve to stop.

534
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,728
So now Steve

535
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:19,747
follows his instructions not to stop

536
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,433
and Jamie sues him.

537
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,435
Doesn't make any sense.

538
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:26,370
Mr. Stevens.

539
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:29,341
Your Honor, it's not
the restraining order

540
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:30,676
that's invalid.

541
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,377
It's the so-called contract.

542
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,346
When Jamie asked Steve
to help him lose weight

543
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,882
he never imagined Steve would
take things as far as he did.

544
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,318
Destruction of valuable
personal property

545
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,819
public humiliation.

546
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,655
Surely the law cannot
protect this type of behavior.

547
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,991
JUDGE: Thank you, Mr. Stevens.

548
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,328
We'll begin with
witnesses tomorrow morning.

549
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,463
In the meantime, Mr. Masters

550
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:54,800
don't forget that there's still a
restraining order with your name on it.

551
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,468
Yes, Your Honor.

552
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:58,828
(<i> gavel pounds</i> )

553
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,291
Ah.

554
00:24:03,391 --> 00:24:05,627
Should I get the kind
for sensitive skin

555
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:07,846
or the kind for
super-sensitive skin?

556
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,265
Since when do you need to shave?

557
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:14,685
Kevin, you haven't
even hit puberty yet.

558
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,786
You look like a
newborn brine shrimp.

559
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:22,027
Hey, Warren, don't forget these.

560
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,779
Whoa, whoa.

561
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,448
Mark, I'm not going to need condoms.

562
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,817
We're just going to the movies.

563
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:30,485
Besides, my mom shops here

564
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:32,320
so can you get rid of those?

565
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,240
These are the kind
that Jeff Goldblum uses.

566
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,600
I read it in<i> Esquire.</i>

567
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:44,974
Hey.

568
00:24:45,934 --> 00:24:48,194
Big weekend.

569
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:57,896
(<i> over P.A.</i> ):
I need a price check

570
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,097
over here.

571
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:00,399
No!

572
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,567
How much is the Ultra Shave Gel?

573
00:25:07,856 --> 00:25:10,116
It's cheap.

574
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,530
Steve, Mr. Samuels.

575
00:25:16,631 --> 00:25:21,402
STEVKnock it off Hey,over there.

576
00:25:21,503 --> 00:25:23,305
i My client wishes
to settle this case.

577
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:24,606
No way, no how.

578
00:25:24,706 --> 00:25:26,658
Steve, you should listen
to what we have to say.

579
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,126
You're not going to win in court.

580
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:29,795
JAMIE: We're brothers.

581
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,047
We don't belong in a court of law.

582
00:25:32,147 --> 00:25:34,715
How crazy is this?

583
00:25:34,816 --> 00:25:37,586
Look, I'm willing to forget
about the money and the damages

584
00:25:37,686 --> 00:25:39,671
if you'll just agree
to stop harassing me.

585
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,373
ED: You can't win, Steve.

586
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,208
There's no way the judge

587
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,544
will uphold this contract.

588
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:48,463
Will you boys excuse
us for a moment?

589
00:25:48,563 --> 00:25:50,896
I need to talk to my brother.

590
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,072
He's right.

591
00:25:57,172 --> 00:25:59,291
I'm probably going to lose in court.

592
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,077
But lucky for me, we
ain't going back to court.

593
00:26:02,177 --> 00:26:03,578
What do you mean?

594
00:26:03,678 --> 00:26:06,548
I bought myself a
little insurance policy.

595
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,049
A 30-second commercial

596
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,085
on tomorrow night's local news.

597
00:26:10,185 --> 00:26:11,670
If you don't drop this case

598
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,972
and let me keep
helping you lose weight

599
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,808
the whole town's going to see this.

600
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,426
What is it?

601
00:26:18,526 --> 00:26:20,786
I'll see you later, Jamie.

602
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,903
So?

603
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,572
Do you have a VCR in your office?

604
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,932
Come on.

605
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,628
You sure you don't want
to watch this yourself?

606
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,046
No. You're my lawyer.

607
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:41,132
Plus, I don't have any
skeletons in the closet.

608
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:43,301
I've got Ring Dings in the pantry

609
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,901
but no skeletons in the closet.

610
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:53,527
That's my house.

611
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:58,250
That's me.

612
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,235
I... yeah.

613
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,043
He's going to run this on TV?

614
00:27:08,143 --> 00:27:10,811
If he does that, we'll sue him.

615
00:27:10,912 --> 00:27:12,013
We're already suing him.

616
00:27:12,113 --> 00:27:13,348
If he runs this on TV

617
00:27:13,448 --> 00:27:15,317
I'll be the laughingstock
of the community.

618
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:16,902
We got to drop the case.

619
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:17,936
We can't do that, Jamie.

620
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:18,987
This is blackmail.

621
00:27:19,087 --> 00:27:20,355
If you let him get away with this

622
00:27:20,455 --> 00:27:21,523
it'll just get worse.

623
00:27:21,623 --> 00:27:24,873
Trust me, we'll deal
with this in court.

624
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:30,348
Now we really need to start
focusing on party favors.

625
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:32,183
You know, little
keepsake, knickknack

626
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:33,652
for your guests to take home.

627
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,252
Oh, I don't think we need that.

628
00:27:37,372 --> 00:27:40,775
Now, my cousin Jeal can
engrave absolutely anything.

629
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:43,111
He once put a bride's initials
on a cocker spaniel's ---.

630
00:27:43,211 --> 00:27:44,746
The man's an artist

631
00:27:44,846 --> 00:27:47,165
and I will give him a holler.

632
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,251
CAROL: Hi, guys.

633
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:50,252
Hi.

634
00:27:50,352 --> 00:27:52,936
Hey, Barbara. Hey, Ari.

635
00:27:53,054 --> 00:27:55,290
Guys, we've got some bad news.

636
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,625
What's that?

637
00:27:56,725 --> 00:27:59,394
Colonel Sanders
can't be our best man.

638
00:27:59,494 --> 00:28:00,395
No.

639
00:28:00,495 --> 00:28:01,663
Really?

640
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,064
He died in 1980.

641
00:28:03,164 --> 00:28:04,733
Gosh. Hmm.

642
00:28:04,833 --> 00:28:06,067
They sent us a coupon

643
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:08,584
for free honey barbecue wings.

644
00:28:09,637 --> 00:28:10,605
Hey, look, you guys

645
00:28:10,705 --> 00:28:12,774
you know, I don't mean to sound like

646
00:28:12,874 --> 00:28:14,492
a broken record on the subject

647
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:15,944
but I'm just not certain

648
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:18,847
you're taking this whole
thing seriously enough.

649
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,215
Sure, Ed.

650
00:28:20,315 --> 00:28:22,017
We could hold off for awhile.

651
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,519
Maybe in a way that's
the wise thing to do.

652
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,688
But I feel like for whatever reason

653
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,890
we've been given this magic moment.

654
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,893
And I don't want to just
sit around being wise

655
00:28:31,993 --> 00:28:33,561
until that moment passes.

656
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:36,197
Yeah, but if the magic
were to pass that quick

657
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,466
maybe you shouldn't
be getting married.

658
00:28:38,566 --> 00:28:40,735
I think you're missing my point.

659
00:28:40,835 --> 00:28:41,970
Look, Ed

660
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,438
If you want us to have our wedding

661
00:28:43,538 --> 00:28:44,939
somewhere else just tell us.

662
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,275
Ari, it's not that I want you
to get married somewhere...

663
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:48,276
Don't be ridiculous.

664
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:49,511
Don't be ridiculous.

665
00:28:49,611 --> 00:28:51,896
Of course you're
getting married here

666
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:52,981
and you know what?

667
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:54,182
It's going to be

668
00:28:54,282 --> 00:28:56,284
the greatest bowling
alley wedding ever.

669
00:28:56,384 --> 00:28:58,819
Thanks, guys.

670
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,021
Thank you.

671
00:29:00,121 --> 00:29:01,189
There you go.

672
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:02,674
All right. Take it easy. Bye now.

673
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:03,692
What are you doing?

674
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:04,743
If they're going to marry

675
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,061
they may as well get married here.

676
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,829
What chance do you
really think this has

677
00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:08,963
of working out?

678
00:29:09,063 --> 00:29:11,249
About as good a
chance as any marriage.

679
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,468
Maybe better.

680
00:29:13,568 --> 00:29:15,828
Look at them.

681
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:18,572
Oh.

682
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:19,808
Yeah, I know.

683
00:29:19,908 --> 00:29:22,110
But I just think that they should...

684
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,878
Maybe it will work
out, maybe it won't.

685
00:29:23,978 --> 00:29:25,080
Who knows?

686
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,165
Things go wrong for
all kinds of reasons.

687
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,834
But who are we to stand
in the way of something

688
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,720
that is so obviously meant to be.

689
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,422
Well, I don't think
they should split up.

690
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:35,774
I just think they should wait.

691
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:39,110
Waiting has its own set of problems.

692
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,229
What if they start
thinking too much?

693
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:43,815
What if they start
second-guessing everything?

694
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,016
There's such a thing

695
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,949
as being too cautious, isn't there?

696
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:00,415
first came to you

697
00:30:00,515 --> 00:30:02,250
with this crazy "contract..."

698
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,885
Objection. We don't think it's crazy

699
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:07,222
and we think it's a
contract, not a "contract."

700
00:30:07,322 --> 00:30:08,390
Sustained.

701
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,308
What was your
brother's state of mind?

702
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:11,259
Upset, confused?

703
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:12,594
Yeah, he was upset.

704
00:30:12,694 --> 00:30:15,013
He'd tried every diet
known to mankind and failed.

705
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,766
He even tried that guy
Jared's thing from Subway

706
00:30:17,866 --> 00:30:19,134
but he didn't have any luck

707
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,769
so he came to me for help.

708
00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:22,921
And you proceeded to
spend the next few months

709
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,006
humiliating him and
destroying his property.

710
00:30:25,106 --> 00:30:26,641
That's what he asked me to do.

711
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,476
That's what he asked
you to do? Really?

712
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,029
So he asked you to smash
his car with a baseball bat?

713
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,647
He asked you to follow him around

714
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:33,748
with a loudspeaker?

715
00:30:33,848 --> 00:30:35,150
He asked you to videotape him eating

716
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,152
without a shirt on in
the privacy of his home

717
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,853
and threatened to
put it on the news?

718
00:30:38,953 --> 00:30:40,522
He asked you to do all these things?

719
00:30:40,622 --> 00:30:42,323
Well, not those
things exactly, but...

720
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:45,059
You and I both know that when
your brother came to you for help

721
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:47,395
he did not plan on any of
this happening, am I right?

722
00:30:47,495 --> 00:30:48,329
I don't know.

723
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,064
You don't know?

724
00:30:50,164 --> 00:30:52,424
Nothing further.

725
00:30:57,739 --> 00:31:00,842
Did you, in fact, do all
those things to your brother?

726
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,178
Yes.

727
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,679
Why?

728
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,781
His cholesterol is 450.

729
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:09,650
His triglycerides are over 300.

730
00:31:09,751 --> 00:31:11,986
He's a borderline diabetic.

731
00:31:12,086 --> 00:31:15,356
If he continues to
eat the way he's eating

732
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,716
my brother will die.

733
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,557
Steven Masters...

734
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:28,670
I believe that you care very
deeply about your brother.

735
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:29,971
And in some circles

736
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:32,524
your actions could
be considered noble.

737
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:35,777
But unfortunately, the law
is not one of those circles.

738
00:31:35,877 --> 00:31:38,696
As Mr. Stevens has argued

739
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:40,782
the agreement between the two of you

740
00:31:40,882 --> 00:31:44,184
does not constitute
a binding contract.

741
00:31:44,285 --> 00:31:45,653
Therefore this court rules

742
00:31:45,753 --> 00:31:48,857
that you must stop harassing
your brother immediately.

743
00:31:48,957 --> 00:31:50,959
However, because of
your good intentions

744
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:53,495
I'm dropping any claim
for damages against you.

745
00:31:53,595 --> 00:31:55,046
This time.

746
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:57,406
Dismissed.

747
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:17,068
Do...

748
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:18,786
(<i> clearing throat</i> )

749
00:32:18,886 --> 00:32:22,472
Do you... do you enjoy
going to the cinema?

750
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:25,743
Yes, Warren, I enjoy
going to the cinema.

751
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,161
Me, too.

752
00:32:27,261 --> 00:32:29,547
I also like going to the movies.

753
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:32,050
Oh, I...

754
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:37,088
To... touch... e

755
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:39,340
uh, touche.

756
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,273
Warren, you don't need
to be nervous around me.

757
00:32:43,611 --> 00:32:45,446
Okay.

758
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,632
Hello. Welcome to Park Theater.

759
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,234
What can I get for you today?

760
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:52,620
We'd like two medium sodas
and two small popcorns, please.

761
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,389
This is a small.

762
00:32:54,489 --> 00:32:57,859
That's a small?

763
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:59,561
Mm-hmm.

764
00:32:59,661 --> 00:33:02,764
Okay, we'll take two mediums then.

765
00:33:02,864 --> 00:33:06,733
For a dollar less...

766
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:08,169
you get the large.

767
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:11,139
All right, we'll
have the large popcorn

768
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,840
and two medium sodas.

769
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,009
You've got to make one
of the sodas a large

770
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:16,177
to get the combo.

771
00:33:16,277 --> 00:33:17,262
Okay, like...

772
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:18,880
we can't eat that much popcorn

773
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,382
and drink that much
soda, you understand that?

774
00:33:21,482 --> 00:33:23,301
For the love of God, no one can.

775
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:25,753
You see these two
containers right here?

776
00:33:25,853 --> 00:33:27,021
Yeah.

777
00:33:27,121 --> 00:33:29,691
These right here
represent your best value.

778
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:32,360
If you want to buy 32
of these little guys

779
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,778
be my guest, go ahead.

780
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:36,664
I'm just trying to
protect you from yourself.

781
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,750
Do you even want popcorn?

782
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:43,270
No, okay, we'll take
this... whatever.

783
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:44,756
Just take this.

784
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,208
Thanks.

785
00:33:47,308 --> 00:33:48,509
It's expensive.

786
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,869
All right, you go ahead.

787
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,817
I think Jessica Martell
likes you, you know?

788
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:56,818
What?

789
00:33:56,918 --> 00:33:58,069
No way.

790
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:59,520
I'm serious.

791
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,774
I saw the way she was looking
at you during group project.

792
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,275
No way. That's... Really?

793
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,743
No.

794
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,578
No, I'm telling you.

795
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:10,663
I'm not here with Jessica Martell.

796
00:34:10,765 --> 00:34:13,001
I'm here with Donna Totsie, so...

797
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:15,361
Thank you.

798
00:34:22,276 --> 00:34:23,261
You know, Donna

799
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,046
a woman is like a flower.

800
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,349
You have to feed her
and water her or else...

801
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:29,484
(<i> yells</i> )

802
00:34:29,584 --> 00:34:30,702
Oh, my God.

803
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:31,753
(<i> alarm blares</i> )

804
00:34:31,853 --> 00:34:33,004
Oh, man.

805
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:34,505
I'm fine, I'm fine.

806
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:36,190
It's cool, it's cool.

807
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,660
A sneaker caught in the escalator.

808
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,677
Oh, my God.

809
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,312
A foot caught in the escalator.

810
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,231
Excuse me. Excuse me, could you...?

811
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,699
Excuse me, could you stop?

812
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,251
Okay, okay, don't move, okay?

813
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:48,336
Don't go anywhere.

814
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:49,671
All right.

815
00:34:49,771 --> 00:34:52,006
Could you tell the
manager to turn off...

816
00:34:52,106 --> 00:34:53,424
the escalator has my...

817
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,009
It's going to eat my foot.

818
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:56,878
That's cool, though. It's cool.

819
00:34:56,978 --> 00:34:57,879
Walk on by.

820
00:34:57,979 --> 00:34:59,213
Hey, have a good night.

821
00:34:59,313 --> 00:35:09,923
I'm just caught in the escalator.

822
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,359
MAN: We come here today

823
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,362
to honor Barbara

824
00:35:14,462 --> 00:35:17,230
and Ari in this blessed event.

825
00:35:17,331 --> 00:35:19,591
Hold on! Hold on!

826
00:35:20,635 --> 00:35:35,916
Heck, you can't have a
wedding without a best man.

827
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,136
Thanks, Ed.

828
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:39,887
You guys screw this marriage up

829
00:35:39,987 --> 00:35:42,190
I'll have to hunt
you down and kill you.

830
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:44,292
We won't.

831
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,652
I know you won't.

832
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,709
I had a really great time tonight.

833
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:02,927
Really?

834
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:05,213
I mean, cool.

835
00:36:05,313 --> 00:36:06,681
Yeah, cool.

836
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:07,965
Me, too.

837
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:10,051
Any date that involves
the Jaws of Life

838
00:36:10,151 --> 00:36:12,411
can't be that bad, right?

839
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:14,756
Unless...

840
00:36:14,856 --> 00:36:17,824
you were in a car accident.

841
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,484
Warren, um, how...

842
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:28,486
how come you never kissed me

843
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:31,606
on top of Mt. Precipice.

844
00:36:31,706 --> 00:36:33,966
Oh, that's...

845
00:36:34,075 --> 00:36:35,443
that's a great question really.

846
00:36:35,543 --> 00:36:36,811
I... I...

847
00:36:36,911 --> 00:36:39,446
just... I don't know.

848
00:36:39,547 --> 00:36:41,232
I was looking for
a sign or something.

849
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:42,550
Like a signal.

850
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:45,286
Oh, I just figured you
weren't interested in me.

851
00:36:45,386 --> 00:36:46,621
What?!

852
00:36:46,721 --> 00:36:48,239
No, no, no, no.

853
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:50,491
That's crazy.

854
00:36:50,591 --> 00:36:51,959
I... I'm...

855
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:53,795
I'm very interested in you.

856
00:36:53,895 --> 00:36:56,863
I possess a great
level of interest...

857
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,065
in you.

858
00:36:58,165 --> 00:37:01,835
You just needed a signal?

859
00:37:01,936 --> 00:37:04,172
Yeah, you know, 'cause then like

860
00:37:04,272 --> 00:37:05,590
I thought...

861
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,392
I thought I missed my
window of opportunity

862
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,728
'cause you and I
never like, you know

863
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,513
kissed up there or anything.

864
00:37:12,613 --> 00:37:14,148
So I figured it was over

865
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:16,484
and we'd just be friends and stuff.

866
00:37:16,584 --> 00:37:17,768
Mm-hmm.

867
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:19,153
You just...

868
00:37:19,253 --> 00:37:21,755
needed a signal?

869
00:37:21,856 --> 00:37:23,291
Yeah.

870
00:37:23,391 --> 00:37:24,992
Like... just like

871
00:37:25,092 --> 00:37:27,494
a look or...

872
00:37:27,595 --> 00:37:29,297
a tap on the shoulder that said

873
00:37:29,397 --> 00:37:32,116
"hey, Warren, now is a
good time to kiss me here."

874
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:33,968
Like, like something like that.

875
00:37:34,068 --> 00:37:36,328
Warren, shh.

876
00:37:37,571 --> 00:37:39,307
Stop talking.

877
00:37:39,407 --> 00:37:41,609
Okay. All right, cool.

878
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:43,969
Cool.

879
00:37:54,488 --> 00:37:56,748
Good night.

880
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:04,289
Good night.

881
00:38:07,168 --> 00:38:09,428

00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:48,252
♪ Ooh, I'm irresponsibly mad ♪

892
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:59,362
♪ For you. ♪

893
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,882
You know, you really should consider

894
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:05,553
keeping Stuckey Bowl open
for weddings more often.

895
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,254
I don't know.

896
00:40:07,354 --> 00:40:08,756
One may be enough.

897
00:40:08,856 --> 00:40:11,175
Not many people want to get
married in a bowling alley.

898
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:12,727
You think?

899
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:13,844
It's sort of nice.

900
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:17,932
As a matter of fact, when I get married
I'm considering doing it right here

901
00:40:18,032 --> 00:40:20,601
at the old Stuckey
Bowl. -Hey, no problem.

902
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:23,654
You know, as long as
it's not league night.

903
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,272
I think those kids
are really in love.

904
00:40:25,372 --> 00:40:26,407
Yeah, so do I.

905
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,742
But then again, who knows?

906
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,194
'Cause it's all just one
big crap shoot anyway.

907
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:31,529
I guess you're right.

908
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:33,698
You can only be so sure,
you know what I mean?

909
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:37,118
You just got to take the plunge
let the chips fall where they may.

910
00:40:37,218 --> 00:40:39,954
I think I just used two cliches
in the same sentence.

911
00:40:40,054 --> 00:40:42,123
Does this mean you're
coming around on fate?

912
00:40:42,223 --> 00:40:44,507
Fate?

913
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:46,660
I'm a big believer in fate.

914
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,020
In fact...

915
00:40:51,398 --> 00:40:55,202
If I bowl a strike I'm
going to ask you to marry me.

916
00:40:55,302 --> 00:40:57,471
Is that so?

917
00:40:57,571 --> 00:40:59,831
Mm-hmm.

918
00:41:00,174 --> 00:41:05,426
What's that? -That's me
moving to the edge of my seat.

919
00:41:25,966 --> 00:41:28,452
It gives me a chance
to pick up the spare.

920
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:34,355
What that's going to get you?
-One night of unbridled lovemaking.

921
00:41:38,879 --> 00:41:43,184
Oh, dream on. Dream on.
-Come on, it's fate.

922
00:41:43,284 --> 00:41:44,685
(<i> laughing</i> )

923
00:41:44,785 --> 00:41:47,905
It's fate. I don't even
want to but it's fate.

924
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:51,859
There's nothing we can do. -You
don't even want to. -I don't want.

925
00:41:51,959 --> 00:41:55,030
You are messing with the pin gods
here and I will not be a party to it.

926
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:57,630
I'm serious. I'm serious, too.

927
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:06,000
