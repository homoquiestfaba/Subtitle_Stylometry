00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:15,749
Since The 1600's There have been numerous versions of Shakespeare's Hamlet adapted to portray vampires

2
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:21,150
This is one of them

00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:24,319
C Plus Pictures presents

4
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:01,176
In association with OffHollywood Pictures

5
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:10,601
Hey, I wasn't done yet!

6
00:01:13,858 --> 00:01:15,241
Hello?

7
00:01:16,362 --> 00:01:17,866
Cheap bastards!

8
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:22,344
a Jordan Galland Film

9
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,387
God, I wish I could yell at someone

10
00:01:29,844 --> 00:01:30,228
I am listening

11
00:01:32,804 --> 00:01:34,624
Who let the grim reaper in here?

12
00:01:34,816 --> 00:01:36,737
My dear, I own this entire theater

13
00:01:36,957 --> 00:01:38,797
Well, I've more fifteen minutes left

14
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:41,303
Fifteen more minutes of that insufferable rehearsal

15
00:01:41,574 --> 00:01:44,370
And I was likely to be strangled by the news of boredom

16
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:48,539
So, you didn't like it?

17
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:53,237
A dancer should dance the dance of her life

18
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:55,708
Toothfairy versus candyland is authobiographical

19
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:58,893
I had a lot of cavities as a kid

20
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:01,942
But you're not a kid anymore

21
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:04,189
You're a woman

22
00:02:05,237 --> 00:02:06,782
Very beautiful woman

23
00:02:08,454 --> 00:02:12,367
And you should be dancing the dance of a beautiful woman

24
00:02:13,423 --> 00:02:14,703
Really?

25
00:02:16,576 --> 00:02:18,145
Sometimes I don't really feel beautiful

26
00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:19,465
Oh

27
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:22,305
But you are beautiful

28
00:02:23,265 --> 00:02:25,321
Give it a moment to sink in

29
00:02:43,575 --> 00:02:48,351
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Undead

30
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,391
Ring ring

31
00:05:09,313 --> 00:05:10,185
Hello

32
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:11,913
Hey, did you just wake up?

33
00:05:12,393 --> 00:05:15,690
No, hi, no. I am ... I am just back from the gym

34
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:18,082
But you promised to pick up my dress this morning

35
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:21,628
Great, Why, why don't you just send your boyfriend's right hand to do that

36
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:23,804
Would you just bring it to Bobby's

37
00:05:24,444 --> 00:05:24,989
Please

38
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,070
I am going to casting and I don't have time

39
00:05:27,597 --> 00:05:29,093
Anna, I don't think that's such a good idea

40
00:05:29,373 --> 00:05:31,222
Mobsters don't generally like ex-boyfriends

41
00:05:31,614 --> 00:05:33,094
He doesn't know who I've used to date

42
00:05:33,664 --> 00:05:34,937
Please, Julsie

43
00:05:35,481 --> 00:05:37,089

You really need to grow up

46
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:42,185
Thank for reminding me

47
00:05:42,601 --> 00:05:44,697
Do you have some young hossie in bed with ya?

48
00:05:45,394 --> 00:05:47,466
No ... no, no

49
00:05:48,106 --> 00:05:49,394
Allright, I've got to go, I am here

50
00:05:49,907 --> 00:05:50,659
Wish me luck

51
00:05:50,931 --> 00:05:51,427
Yeah, ok, bye

52
00:05:55,827 --> 00:05:57,363
You're not gonna need the paper back, ok?

53
00:06:02,869 --> 00:06:04,677
So what do you think is wrong with me, doctor?

54
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:08,406
Well, this is a sample, and I think it will help with your strange symptoms

55
00:06:08,766 --> 00:06:09,606
It's vague

56
00:06:10,142 --> 00:06:11,221
You're gonna be fine, yeah

57
00:06:12,064 --> 00:06:13,288
Ahh, look, the cat just dragged in

58
00:06:13,604 --> 00:06:14,420
I am allergic to cats

59
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,974
Hey

60
00:06:16,534 --> 00:06:17,158
Uhm ...

61
00:06:17,535 --> 00:06:20,015
This is my dad

62
00:06:20,903 --> 00:06:22,872
And ehm, that's Hugo Pepper

63
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:25,600
Hugo, What's wrong with you today?

64
00:06:26,096 --> 00:06:30,176
Eeh, sunspots, dizziness, tremors

65
00:06:30,984 --> 00:06:31,728
He's always here

66
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:33,001
I thought you lived alone

67
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:36,105
I, I do live in there alone

68
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:38,970
and my dad works in here ... alone

69
00:06:39,258 --> 00:06:40,386
Can you come and talk to me, Julian?

70
00:06:40,658 --> 00:06:41,194
Yeah

71
00:06:41,594 --> 00:06:43,971
So, I will call you

72
00:06:44,243 --> 00:06:46,210
Hm, you don't have my number

73
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,291
I can find ya, ok?

74
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:48,579
eh

75
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:55,829
Aaaaa

76
00:06:57,013 --> 00:06:57,853
eee

77
00:06:58,581 --> 00:07:01,661
You know, it is really hard for me to see you like this, Julian

78
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,231
You look terrible

79
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:05,743
You've got all these girls who are coming and going

80
00:07:06,122 --> 00:07:08,616
you could've put a revolving door in there and make it easier for them

81
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,991
Dad, I am just fighting off some demons, that's all

82
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:12,759
I've got just a thing for that

83
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,264
A prescription for fighting demons?

84
00:07:14,488 --> 00:07:17,560
No, this is a prescription for getting a job

85
00:07:19,073 --> 00:07:24,810
Off Broadway production of Hamlet seeks young controllable human theater director

86
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:27,681
Sounds pretty stupid

87
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,162
Yeah, ok, the interview is in thirty minutes, get going!

88
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,506
No, no, no. I am not gonna get going, dad

89
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:34,219
I am not a theater director anymore

90
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:36,323
I've got used to it, I suggest you do the same

91
00:07:36,763 --> 00:07:39,884
Hey, it's either that or you move out of my office

92
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,452
That's fine with me

93
00:07:41,741 --> 00:07:43,285
Wait, like pa ... pay my own rent?

94
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,132
Yeah, well, most people of your age do

95
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:47,925
Zifromax?

96
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,278
Look, these symptoms are serious, ok?

97
00:07:50,605 --> 00:07:52,326
You're dizzy, you've got fatigue, you're achy

98
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:54,110
Dad, it's a hangover

99
00:07:58,351 --> 00:07:59,503
Was that blonde a model?

100
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:03,627
Job interview with a vampire

101
00:08:17,314 --> 00:08:18,258
Eh, Hi

102
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:22,299
E ... excuse me, hi

103
00:08:24,956 --> 00:08:26,132
My name is Julian Marsh

104
00:08:26,444 --> 00:08:28,628
I saw your ad, in the paper

105
00:08:31,188 --> 00:08:34,004
I requested an aryan body builder

106
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:38,446
Do you know, where ... where I'd go about the theater directing position?

107
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:40,174
Oooh

108
00:08:40,398 --> 00:08:41,518
That ad

109
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,702
Oh

110
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:43,662
Haha

111
00:08:44,431 --> 00:08:47,982
Excuse the dead flowers, the master loves them so

112
00:08:48,622 --> 00:08:49,502
Ok

113
00:08:49,726 --> 00:08:51,118
Come and meet the others

114
00:08:58,992 --> 00:09:01,959
This is Leyuba and Zadeska

115
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:04,664
They will be doing costumes and make up

116
00:09:05,096 --> 00:09:07,681
They will be also doing some acting

117
00:09:08,273 --> 00:09:11,289
and I will be taking a few rows myself

118
00:09:12,003 --> 00:09:13,883
He's yummy

119
00:09:14,242 --> 00:09:16,323
A real renaissance man and women

120
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:18,747
It's a real renaissance fair here

121
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,660
The renaissance was a flee market

122
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,348
compared to the glory of Ancient Rome

123
00:09:26,925 --> 00:09:29,197
This is Theo Horace, our writer

124
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,509
Tell me, what do you know about Rosencrantz and Guildenstern?

125
00:09:34,853 --> 00:09:37,518
Eh, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, they are two idiots

126
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,583
hired to spy on Hamlet. They ... ehm

127
00:09:40,135 --> 00:09:42,103
They died at the end

128
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:45,311
Very good, you know your stuff

129
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:49,436
This is the same theater, where the dancer Lauren Lamont

130
00:09:49,684 --> 00:09:51,164
she was murdered here, right?

131
00:09:51,348 --> 00:09:52,444
Please

132
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:54,517
Don't interrupt!

133
00:09:55,901 --> 00:09:58,598
We start rehearsals next week

134
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,350
Next week ... ok

135
00:10:00,702 --> 00:10:03,311
well I've the perfect actor in line for Hamlet

136
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:05,247
Really, really

137
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:06,395
Oh good, good, good, good

138
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,148
yes, good, yes, I know

139
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,653
Why don't we have him out for a drink, later

140
00:10:12,925 --> 00:10:13,918
I love them Lindlife

141
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:16,317
Theo never hires anyone he can't party with

142
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:18,566
It's this thing

143
00:10:19,246 --> 00:10:24,070
I demand an undying devotion to the play

144
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:25,454
Yeah, of course

145
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,750
One last question

146
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,271
Do you suffer from any blood vessel abnormality

147
00:10:31,488 --> 00:10:34,712
iron inefficiencies, vitamin B deficiencies

148
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,433
and or intravenous drug usage?

149
00:10:39,425 --> 00:10:40,193
No

150
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:41,882
Oh, you're too good to be true

151
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,586
Ah

152
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:50,554
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Undead

153
00:10:51,314 --> 00:10:55,619
Are we interested to see how Shakespeare and zombies go together?

154
00:10:55,844 --> 00:10:57,836
Not zombies!

155
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,604
Vampires!

156
00:10:59,884 --> 00:11:00,724
How?

157
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:03,565
Yeah, right. That makes way more sense

158
00:11:03,893 --> 00:11:05,457
Girls!

159
00:11:05,677 --> 00:11:07,645
Escort mister Marsh to the door

160
00:11:09,397 --> 00:11:11,405
Good day Julian. Nice to meet you

161
00:11:14,534 --> 00:11:16,182
Come with us

162
00:11:18,935 --> 00:11:19,991
He's perfect

163
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:22,392
He's young and controllable

164
00:11:22,728 --> 00:11:24,824
and he's human

165
00:11:29,137 --> 00:11:30,913
I am glad I am your friend. Be honest with me

166
00:11:31,481 --> 00:11:32,873
Don't get me wrong man. I love Anna

167
00:11:33,178 --> 00:11:34,818
I am a big Anna fan

168
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:36,450
I totally miss being your guy's third wheel

169
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,802
some of the best days of my life

170
00:11:38,075 --> 00:11:39,387
But, look, crown Jules ...

171
00:11:39,978 --> 00:11:43,371
you have gotta stop your girlfriend suck life out of you

172
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:45,827
yeah, you can pick up her dress and soho

173
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,099
you can cure cancer

174
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:50,748
you can rescue a burning orphanage full of kittens

175
00:11:50,948 --> 00:11:51,749
but trust me

176
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,133
one things girls never forget

177
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,685
is when you cheat on them with a stripper

178
00:11:56,397 --> 00:11:57,101
Really don't ...

179
00:11:57,325 --> 00:11:59,469
dont' do guys that mistake ...

180
00:11:59,717 --> 00:12:00,621
... in college?

181
00:12:00,837 --> 00:12:02,269
Yes, yes they do

182
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:03,670
absolutely

183
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:05,654
Your mistake was telling her the truth

184
00:12:06,198 --> 00:12:07,222
after lying to her

185
00:12:07,431 --> 00:12:09,367
and then thinking she will forgive you for it

186
00:12:11,015 --> 00:12:11,383
You're right

187
00:12:11,888 --> 00:12:12,616
that was ...

188
00:12:12,968 --> 00:12:13,952
... stupid

189
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:15,919
It smells so good in here

190
00:12:16,191 --> 00:12:17,872
It smells great, you know what that's called?

191
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,160
Extreme peace

192
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
It's extremely nice

193
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,881
Drives the ladies crazy

194
00:12:27,635 --> 00:12:28,219
Are you out of your mind?

195
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:29,739
Bobby Bianchi's house?

196
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,460
Do you know, who Bobby Bianchi is?

197
00:12:31,748 --> 00:12:32,764
No, no, no, no, no

198
00:12:32,956 --> 00:12:33,241
no, no, crazy!

199
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:34,578
You know karate, right?

200
00:12:34,793 --> 00:12:35,634
I know karate, yeah

201
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:36,930
I've got white belt in karate

202
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:37,336
Do you know what that means?

203
00:12:37,496 --> 00:12:37,944
I can like

204
00:12:38,152 --> 00:12:38,880
chudo cha

205
00:12:39,096 --> 00:12:40,256
And you know what, by the way

206
00:12:40,432 --> 00:12:42,601
I think this red is maybe the wrong colour for Anna's hair

207
00:12:42,825 --> 00:12:44,385
There's lot of dresses in this place ...

208
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:45,594
What you just said?

209
00:12:45,802 --> 00:12:47,442
I said, don't think this red ...

210
00:12:47,626 --> 00:12:48,922
No, no, it's not what you said

211
00:12:49,122 --> 00:12:49,802
but how you said

212
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:53,393
With your hand like, say it like that

213
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:55,946
Don't you think this red is a wrong colour

214
00:12:56,226 --> 00:12:57,722
I am a genious

215
00:12:58,474 --> 00:12:59,282
Why?

216
00:12:59,506 --> 00:13:01,179
Bobby can't forget on us if he thinks we're gay

217
00:13:02,493 --> 00:13:03,717
You see, this is why you're a director

218
00:13:03,965 --> 00:13:05,606
and this's why I am an actor, right?

219
00:13:05,822 --> 00:13:06,670
Cause I am doing this

220
00:13:06,878 --> 00:13:10,279
It's kind of like, you know: Scorcese and the Nero strike again, bitches!

221
00:13:11,195 --> 00:13:12,028
I am just saying, if it were me

222
00:13:12,226 --> 00:13:13,812
I'll be a shaking little baby

223
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:16,259
it's just kind of a scary thing, in a theater with a murdered girl

224
00:13:16,507 --> 00:13:17,868
You're not making me feel any better

225
00:13:18,036 --> 00:13:18,238
Can you hold this

226
00:13:18,421 --> 00:13:19,958
I can't have a pink shirt and hold a red dress

227
00:13:20,173 --> 00:13:23,838
Well, you see, in the night you feel the breath of the ghost on your neck

228
00:13:24,038 --> 00:13:25,077
and hear the: whaaa whuu

229
00:13:25,245 --> 00:13:26,701
Right, so I guess you don't want play Hamlet then

230
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,518
No, I didn't said, I am an actor

231
00:13:27,686 --> 00:13:29,134
Well, then stop trying to scare me

232
00:13:29,398 --> 00:13:30,350
Oh, my god

233
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,247
Can I have your autograph?

234
00:13:33,415 --> 00:13:34,063
Shit

235
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:34,999
Yeah

236
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:35,831
Shit

237
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:37,816
Don't be jealous, it's a fan

238
00:13:38,056 --> 00:13:39,864
You are really good as the bumblebee at the comercial

239
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,216
You have a picture of me?

240
00:13:41,392 --> 00:13:42,872
Make it up to Shelley Florence, that's me

241
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:43,864
That's flattering

242
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,688
I mean, that's weird, but it's flattering

243
00:13:44,864 --> 00:13:46,824
You keep that pen, if you're ever in the play

244
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:49,464
involing the Hamlet and the vampires

245
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,889
you call the number on that pen

246
00:13:56,105 --> 00:13:57,394
You are in danger

247
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,074
Ok

248
00:13:59,474 --> 00:14:00,683
Ble, bleh

249
00:14:01,346 --> 00:14:02,243
You're in danger

250
00:14:02,611 --> 00:14:05,571
You're loosing your goddamned mind, crazy bat

251
00:14:06,755 --> 00:14:07,587
Who's afraid of Bobby Bianchi?

252
00:14:07,787 --> 00:14:09,564
Are you sick of feeling like a janitor?

253
00:14:09,804 --> 00:14:10,820
Or a cleaning lady?

254
00:14:11,052 --> 00:14:13,852
Get ready to whack some germs

255
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,573
with my new Germ-o-whack

256
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:18,725
You guys are late

257
00:14:18,965 --> 00:14:19,558
Sorry

258
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,390
Oh my god, what happened to my dress?

259
00:14:21,638 --> 00:14:23,677
I am sorry, this homeless woman came out of nowhere

260
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:25,646
It's always something coming out of nowhere

261
00:14:25,878 --> 00:14:28,110
I mean shit from nowhere, and what happened to my dress

262
00:14:28,415 --> 00:14:31,983
With my new design, a man can clean his hands

263
00:14:32,183 --> 00:14:33,864
and still feel like a male

264
00:14:34,176 --> 00:14:35,232
not a female

265
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,048
Hey, is that the bumblebee guy from the serial comercial

266
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:43,208
I can't believe it, in my fucking house?

267
00:14:43,712 --> 00:14:44,376
Ehey!

268
00:14:44,681 --> 00:14:46,793
Hello, je m'appelle Vince, enchante

269
00:14:47,057 --> 00:14:49,810
Very wonderful to be in your domain

270
00:14:50,114 --> 00:14:52,210
When you were grownup, did you ever think

271
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:54,603
I wanna be all that I can be?

272
00:14:56,978 --> 00:14:57,634
Get it?

273
00:14:57,874 --> 00:15:00,547
Yes, it's very funny. He's very funny

274
00:15:00,803 --> 00:15:03,780
No, with all the honesty, I was always deadly serious about being a hesbian

275
00:15:03,995 --> 00:15:06,884
it's very common for someone who's as gay as I am

276
00:15:07,652 --> 00:15:08,460
Hesbian?

277
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,293
How about you

278
00:15:10,573 --> 00:15:11,981
Totally gay

279
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,925
That's good for you two guys

280
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:15,325
because I usually like it, when

281
00:15:15,573 --> 00:15:17,782
you know, the goodlooking guys are gay

282
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:19,254
Me too

283
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,559
Hm, not that I think you two are goodlooking or anything

284
00:15:25,575 --> 00:15:28,840
Hey, listen, have a drink, I gotta go back to my promo conference

285
00:15:29,152 --> 00:15:30,607
Excuse me, I am sorry

286
00:15:31,992 --> 00:15:32,904
Germ-o-whack!

287
00:15:33,656 --> 00:15:36,393
Clean your hands like a male man

288
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:40,466
What is this have to do with you working for the post office

289
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:46,338
No, no, it's like being a male but being a man

290
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:48,786
Isn't it basically just like a water gun

291
00:15:49,178 --> 00:15:50,859
Forget it, forget it, obviously, with rack like that

292
00:15:51,099 --> 00:15:52,627
you don't know what I am talking about, right

293
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:56,220
Hey, bumblebee, bumbee, help me out with the tagline

294
00:15:56,476 --> 00:15:57,516
need some quick, snap

295
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,388
Idea's are Julian's department

296
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:00,581
Ah

297
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:02,389
Allright, allright, give me some, some good

298
00:16:02,637 --> 00:16:03,612
It really sell itself

299
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:04,813
Come one, hook me up

300
00:16:05,021 --> 00:16:05,621
Germ-o-whack!

301
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:10,678
It' a mean clean whacking machine

302
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:13,974
I like that, I am gonna use that

303
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:15,623
Hey honey, come here, come here

304
00:16:15,927 --> 00:16:17,079
Look hot, baby

305
00:16:18,054 --> 00:16:20,117
Oh, man, I can't watch this

306
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:23,110
Makes me natious seeing them together

307
00:16:23,622 --> 00:16:25,230
I don't know what she sees in this guy

308
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:28,034
He gonna be as ... rich and attractive

309
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,956
Where does a girl get a drink in this place?

310
00:16:30,684 --> 00:16:32,028
Waiter, chardonay

311
00:16:32,348 --> 00:16:33,739
I am Vince

312
00:16:33,923 --> 00:16:34,611
Hi Cookie

313
00:16:34,835 --> 00:16:36,437
Hey, you know, I saw you

314
00:16:36,572 --> 00:16:39,509
and I thought - that's a girl who's not afraid to get controversial

315
00:16:39,844 --> 00:16:42,429
You know I really liked - forever people's engines

316
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:44,302
Absolutely, vrum

317
00:16:44,973 --> 00:16:48,614
Sorry to interrupt, you two love birds

318
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:53,294
They're taking pictures and her hair is just not quite working for me

319
00:16:53,414 --> 00:16:54,222
I could fix it

320
00:16:55,703 --> 00:16:57,295
Aye, sure kid, you can use my bedroom

321
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:59,055
as long you keep it nice and clean

322
00:16:59,575 --> 00:17:00,664
Let me see your hands

323
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:04,360
It's on me

324
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,865
Well, I mean, it's on you, but ...

325
00:17:06,073 --> 00:17:07,497
... it's on me

326
00:17:09,744 --> 00:17:11,521
Do you have to do this every time we get together?

327
00:17:15,554 --> 00:17:16,762
Ok, what the fuck is this?

328
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:20,786
Bobby is little quirky, he likes to get into mood

329
00:17:21,363 --> 00:17:22,835
Does the mood include puking?

330
00:17:23,163 --> 00:17:24,235
You hate me, don't you?

331
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:26,747
No, no I don't

332
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,347
I am the opposite of hate you

333
00:17:31,764 --> 00:17:32,604
I heart you

334
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:33,788
Eew!

335
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,164
You're my soulmate

336
00:17:35,452 --> 00:17:36,837
Double eew!

337
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:39,613
Did you googled cheesy things to say before you got here?

338
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:41,542
No, my internet's down

339
00:17:41,734 --> 00:17:44,829
you're, yours everything to me

340
00:17:44,974 --> 00:17:46,742
I, I care about you so much

341
00:17:47,102 --> 00:17:48,926
You still can't say "I love you"

342
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,903
I passion you, I adore you, you're

343
00:17:52,047 --> 00:17:55,191
You're a looser, you live in your dad's office and you have no job!

344
00:17:55,631 --> 00:17:58,728
Well, I do have a job actually, I am directing Hamlet

345
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,336
It's a weird adaptation

346
00:18:02,008 --> 00:18:03,592
Well,

347
00:18:05,064 --> 00:18:07,217
did you cast Ophelia yet?

348
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:09,785
We do have someone in mind for the role

349
00:18:10,129 --> 00:18:13,058
But, ehm, maybe one of the smaller parts get you audition

350
00:18:13,354 --> 00:18:14,562
Thanks

351
00:18:14,754 --> 00:18:15,546
Come on, let's go nancy boy

352
00:18:17,587 --> 00:18:18,418
Easy, thank you

353
00:18:18,874 --> 00:18:19,882
What's my sexy music doing on?

354
00:18:20,226 --> 00:18:21,515
It was an accident, baby

355
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:24,363
It was an accident I caught this guy feeling up Cookie Lambet's tits?

356
00:18:24,611 --> 00:18:25,788
I thought he was a queer

357
00:18:25,995 --> 00:18:27,628
Allright, she has breast implants

358
00:18:27,988 --> 00:18:30,532
and she asked me to examine them to see if they felt real

359
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,613
and I tell you what

360
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:33,613
not bad, really not bad at all, you'd be surprised

361
00:18:34,085 --> 00:18:36,413
Girls like gay men giving them advice

362
00:18:36,581 --> 00:18:38,157
because it's honest and it's not sexually motivated

363
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:40,838
That's actually true

364
00:18:41,582 --> 00:18:42,998
No, I don't buy it, you guys are out of here

365
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,974
No, you know what, (blabla) you're out of here

366
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,383
You're lucky there's no bullets in this Germ-o-whack, you understand me?

367
00:18:47,607 --> 00:18:50,431
I tell you what, that is one lucky man

368
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:53,335
one look and two more seconds I would have his ass, Jules

369
00:18:53,543 --> 00:18:54,375
I would have just

370
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:55,871
Oh, shit, dude, we gotta go back

371
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:56,776
I forgot my skateboard

372
00:18:56,968 --> 00:18:58,016
No, what, are you kidding me?

373
00:18:58,136 --> 00:18:59,624
That guy is fucking crazy, forget about it

374
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,417
I don't know why we went there at the first place

375
00:19:02,689 --> 00:19:06,650
Not so bad, in the end did get the feel of that girl's tits

376
00:19:06,818 --> 00:19:08,418
think I kinda like being gay

377
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,498
Hey, you gotta tell me about meet this guy by the way

378
00:19:15,338 --> 00:19:19,796
It's not the emotional demands of playing Hamlet that I am concerned about

379
00:19:20,003 --> 00:19:26,629
but there is a physical demand that requires very specific

380
00:19:28,324 --> 00:19:29,324
state of

381
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:33,973
fitness

382
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:35,373
Do you suffer from any ...

383
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,902
bone marrow problems?

384
00:19:41,535 --> 00:19:42,593
Ehm ...

385
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:45,024
No

386
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,008
Vince will do

387
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:56,897
What just happened, what he say?

388
00:19:57,257 --> 00:19:58,329
Vince will do

389
00:19:58,937 --> 00:19:59,753
So you got it?

390
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:01,545
Vince will do for Hamlet my friend

391
00:20:01,841 --> 00:20:02,873
Salut

392
00:20:03,337 --> 00:20:04,769
Oh, I got the job, but I am telling you

393
00:20:04,993 --> 00:20:06,737
can't change the name of the play to Hamlette

394
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:13,229
Enough business

395
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:15,006
Ladies, tell me the story

396
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:16,646
What do you do?

397
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,541
Whatever Theo tells us to do

398
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,830
We're his slaves

399
00:20:22,398 --> 00:20:23,838
We are slaves

400
00:20:24,247 --> 00:20:26,455
That's cool man, I can dig that

401
00:20:50,644 --> 00:20:52,404
Jules, did you see that?

402
00:20:52,805 --> 00:20:56,149
you seek the control that this man has over these women

403
00:20:56,405 --> 00:20:57,556
it's unbelievable!

404
00:20:57,996 --> 00:20:59,437
He's a fucking visionary or something

405
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,270
and he can dance

406
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,642
Fellows, I need that table

407
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:08,946
What's up?

408
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:10,755
Do me a favor, both of you get up

409
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:11,899
no no no no no

410
00:21:12,123 --> 00:21:12,795
We're here with Theo

411
00:21:12,995 --> 00:21:14,027
Theo who, I don't see Theo

412
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,404
No, he's here, he's right behing you, he's dancing

413
00:21:16,716 --> 00:21:17,540
You're talking back

414
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,500
I am not talking back ...

415
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,916
Now you're getting loud

416
00:21:21,212 --> 00:21:22,396
No, I am crying over the music

417
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,772
It's very loud in here

418
00:21:24,012 --> 00:21:26,629
Get the fuck up!

419
00:21:27,757 --> 00:21:31,374
I'll open the can, buddy, I will open the can, I will open the ... ah

420
00:21:31,862 --> 00:21:32,982
Ok, allright, ok, hey, you know

421
00:21:33,182 --> 00:21:35,463
I will take this guy outside, I will handle him outside

422
00:21:35,774 --> 00:21:37,686
Ok, hey, hey, ok, easy

423
00:21:40,015 --> 00:21:41,863
I'll tell you what, you're on thin ice, my friend

424
00:21:43,384 --> 00:21:44,712
Son of the bitch!

425
00:21:53,656 --> 00:21:55,809
What the fuck?

426
00:22:03,546 --> 00:22:04,739
Oh, shit!

427
00:22:04,939 --> 00:22:06,043
Hey, look, look , look

428
00:22:06,843 --> 00:22:07,755
What am I looking at?

429
00:22:09,235 --> 00:22:10,492
Oh my god, what the hell is going on?

430
00:22:10,611 --> 00:22:11,931
I feel like I am loosing my goddamned mind

431
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:13,147
I stood I saw

432
00:22:14,011 --> 00:22:15,948
Theo and those two girls from dance floor

433
00:22:16,548 --> 00:22:18,652
and then there was this other girl and they were like eating her or something

434
00:22:19,044 --> 00:22:20,909
Put this on, we should get your head checked out

435
00:22:21,117 --> 00:22:23,021
No, we should get out of here, that's what we should do

436
00:22:23,357 --> 00:22:24,253
You got hit?

437
00:22:24,405 --> 00:22:25,614
Of course I got hit, it was a fucking fight!

438
00:22:28,453 --> 00:22:30,254
Grave new world

439
00:22:30,726 --> 00:22:31,502
Harry, parry, thrust

440
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,535
Harry, parry, thrust

441
00:22:35,255 --> 00:22:38,543
Dude, I am so psyched about this play inside of play, bro

442
00:22:38,783 --> 00:22:42,256
man, dude, it's like ... we're gonna rock, dog

443
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,473
There is my Rosencrantz and my Guildenstern

444
00:22:44,921 --> 00:22:46,224
Wait, which one am I again?

445
00:22:46,361 --> 00:22:47,320
You're the one who can't read

446
00:22:47,672 --> 00:22:48,456
Put this around your waist

447
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:50,009
I can read dude, periodicals

448
00:22:50,137 --> 00:22:51,001
Put this on

449
00:22:51,089 --> 00:22:51,737
He means magazines

450
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:53,489
Great, I don't remember this from the script

451
00:22:53,713 --> 00:22:55,426
Maybe we signed up for the wrong game, bro!

452
00:22:55,736 --> 00:22:57,657
Any play for you would be the wrong game, Carlo

453
00:22:57,825 --> 00:23:02,362
You see guys, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern were touched to hip

454
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:07,474
metaphorically, so ... we're gonna, literally, tie you guys together

455
00:23:07,634 --> 00:23:09,587
and see if we can learn something about the characters

456
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:14,283
Ok, I get the literal metaphore, but don't you think it's little heavy handed?

457
00:23:14,579 --> 00:23:16,059
I mean I can act without rope

458
00:23:16,251 --> 00:23:16,948
I am trained

459
00:23:17,132 --> 00:23:18,260
I hope so, I have never ..

460
00:23:18,612 --> 00:23:20,980
... never found actors on the internet before

461
00:23:21,244 --> 00:23:22,828
There is a lot of great people on the internet

462
00:23:23,389 --> 00:23:27,405
I've been trained, classically in combat and improvisation

463
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:29,749
Ok, I'll take that into consideration

464
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:32,766
Perhaps we should use this to hang Carlo, and cast someone else

465
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,662
That's funny that you're joking around

466
00:23:34,878 --> 00:23:37,247
I hope that means, you guys are completely off book than

467
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:38,831
Without lines?

468
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:43,583
Ok, guys, I want everyone here to just close their eyes for one moment

469
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:45,367
I am serious, close

470
00:23:45,575 --> 00:23:47,264
No peeking mister Liden!

471
00:23:47,464 --> 00:23:50,287
If you're peeking you're only cheating yourself of the experience

472
00:23:50,575 --> 00:23:51,992
Now everyone close your eyes

473
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,432
I want you all to take a moment and think about your characters

474
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,505
How are you like them, how are you not like them

475
00:23:57,913 --> 00:23:59,657
And now I want you to imagine

476
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:01,425
you're sitting in a field

477
00:24:02,082 --> 00:24:04,050
leaning against an apple tree

478
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:07,202
and you're little hungry and in front of you is

479
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,242
the most delicious, juicy apple

480
00:24:10,202 --> 00:24:11,450
Ok, now, reach out for it

481
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:11,818
Say, Jully

482
00:24:12,194 --> 00:24:12,962
What Vince

483
00:24:13,098 --> 00:24:14,138
I got question for you

484
00:24:14,282 --> 00:24:15,274
Make it quick, what?

485
00:24:15,442 --> 00:24:17,114
Help a brother out with the color

486
00:24:17,258 --> 00:24:19,266
Are we talking about red apple, are we talking about green apple, what?

487
00:24:19,522 --> 00:24:20,250
Maybe a pear

488
00:24:21,635 --> 00:24:22,819
It makes no difference

489
00:24:22,915 --> 00:24:24,451
Of course it makes a difference!

490
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:26,067
Allright, mister Lidon

491
00:24:27,268 --> 00:24:28,332
Look at Theo guys!

492
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,092
Everyone look at Theo!

493
00:24:30,461 --> 00:24:31,981
This is what I am talking about

494
00:24:32,253 --> 00:24:33,205
This is acting!

495
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:34,836
There is no separation between him and his character

496
00:24:35,084 --> 00:24:36,300
He is his character

497
00:24:37,949 --> 00:24:39,053
Don't look at me!

498
00:24:39,165 --> 00:24:40,349
Ok, stop looking at Theo!

499
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:43,166
It's good work Theo, it's really good work

500
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,218
One should only eat what one hungers for

501
00:24:51,522 --> 00:24:52,322
That's my philosophy

502
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:56,947
There are more things in heaven and Earth that are dreamt of your philosophy, Horatio

503
00:24:58,099 --> 00:25:01,188
You should learn to enjoy the gift that I gave you, Hamlet

504
00:25:01,932 --> 00:25:04,420
What gift? I want a gift too

505
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,349
Rosencrantz is a simple mind, prince Hamlet

506
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,804
Forgive him

507
00:25:09,645 --> 00:25:11,877
Jules, is that work with two fingers like that?

508
00:25:12,605 --> 00:25:14,548
Do I need to get my thumb envolved somehow

509
00:25:15,228 --> 00:25:16,069
or prong him?

510
00:25:16,373 --> 00:25:17,493
I just want to devastate him!

511
00:25:18,229 --> 00:25:19,373
I don't really like any of it

512
00:25:19,565 --> 00:25:21,974
It's good that you have learned your lines, finally

513
00:25:22,406 --> 00:25:25,191
Maybe we ... we could try acting a little bit more

514
00:25:25,503 --> 00:25:28,240
Since we are talking about the play, right

515
00:25:28,511 --> 00:25:31,032
like, I was thinking, we could do this modernizations, bro

516
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:33,527
Instead of Rosencrantz and Guildensterns

517
00:25:33,855 --> 00:25:34,991
Do you think we can be like ...

518
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,480
Rosenbros and Guildendude

519
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:40,328
or what about like - Dudencrantz and Dogenstern?

520
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:42,665
Stupid idea

521
00:25:42,977 --> 00:25:44,193
Or like Rosenbros and Goldenhose

522
00:25:44,354 --> 00:25:45,353
Carl, stop!

523
00:25:45,522 --> 00:25:46,426
What do you talking about?

524
00:25:46,858 --> 00:25:47,658
Quick note

525
00:25:47,802 --> 00:25:50,498
There's still time to combine this into one character

526
00:25:57,819 --> 00:26:00,155
Agh, well aimed Horatio

527
00:26:00,323 --> 00:26:02,580
Your arrows have outrageous fortune

528
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:06,812
Meow

529
00:26:06,956 --> 00:26:10,165
You may be good with arrows and bows, myself I am good with ribbons and bows

530
00:26:10,405 --> 00:26:12,333
Who designed your clothing? That outfit just screams

531
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:14,613
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark!

532
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:15,909
Is that a Roman toga?

533
00:26:16,062 --> 00:26:17,718
It's got to go!

534
00:26:18,006 --> 00:26:20,126
To go? What? What is that? That's not on the script

535
00:26:20,422 --> 00:26:22,431
I like it!

536
00:26:23,221 --> 00:26:24,574
We're modernizing!

537
00:26:30,886 --> 00:26:31,662
Hello

538
00:26:32,438 --> 00:26:33,455
Let's continue

539
00:26:33,695 --> 00:26:36,624
Ah, just nothing, play. What do you doing?

540
00:26:38,904 --> 00:26:41,256
You go. All the bloodwork looks greats, so I don't see a problem there

541
00:26:42,152 --> 00:26:43,384
What was the deal with the grapes?

542
00:26:44,128 --> 00:26:45,912
Ate four pounds for dinner last night

543
00:26:47,008 --> 00:26:49,537
Ok, I think, maybe you want to cut back, Ok? Because that's ...

544
00:26:50,705 --> 00:26:52,081
Hey Hugo, you are still sick?

545
00:26:52,713 --> 00:26:54,930
I wouldn't be, if a certain doctor could help me

546
00:26:55,394 --> 00:26:56,266
Hi doctor Marsh

547
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:59,331
Hey, Anna, I would call him before you go in there

548
00:26:59,627 --> 00:27:01,138
Jesus

549
00:27:01,426 --> 00:27:03,595
Yeah, I wish you could keep him out of trouble

550
00:27:04,187 --> 00:27:05,451
That's not my job anymore

551
00:27:10,932 --> 00:27:11,644
Hello

552
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,821
Do you have some young hossie in bed with ya?

553
00:27:14,037 --> 00:27:15,693
No, no, ehm

554
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:20,008
I ... I am just getting back from the gym

555
00:27:20,576 --> 00:27:22,431
Just getting back from the gym

556
00:27:22,735 --> 00:27:23,848
Very unlikely

557
00:27:24,167 --> 00:27:27,864
Yeah, I was ... you know, mostly cardiovascular today

558
00:27:28,216 --> 00:27:29,607
You've been blowing me up for two weeks now

559
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,328
and amount such a bedroom with my headshot

560
00:27:32,321 --> 00:27:33,065
I am coming in

561
00:27:33,337 --> 00:27:34,602
Anna, don't, Anna, it's not a good time!

562
00:27:44,082 --> 00:27:45,123
I will, call you

563
00:27:45,323 --> 00:27:46,803
Asshole!

564
00:27:49,699 --> 00:27:52,196
I wasn't so growsed that I might feel little depressed

565
00:27:52,828 --> 00:27:54,596
Yeah, well, you know ... I am impressed

566
00:27:55,205 --> 00:27:57,076
You're going out with the sleaziest guy in the New York City

567
00:27:58,516 --> 00:28:01,341
With him the sleaziness is more like confidence

568
00:28:02,373 --> 00:28:03,805
And he buys me flowers

569
00:28:04,245 --> 00:28:05,862
That's such a predictable thing for you to say

570
00:28:07,782 --> 00:28:09,190
I have to go to the theater

571
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:13,519
Where I am directing Hamlet ... sort of

572
00:28:15,295 --> 00:28:16,631
I don't know what you're doing

573
00:28:17,311 --> 00:28:19,271
I am coming with you I gotta job of my headshot

574
00:28:21,088 --> 00:28:22,592
The theater is not a democracy

575
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,177
It's a dictatorship and I am the boss here

576
00:28:25,617 --> 00:28:27,969
Hey, Theo, what's up?

577
00:28:29,585 --> 00:28:30,874
She is my Ophelia!

578
00:28:31,905 --> 00:28:34,169
We ... We are already rehearsing with Daisy

579
00:28:34,705 --> 00:28:36,626
She even smells like the real Ophelia

580
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:37,946
How could you even know?

581
00:28:38,147 --> 00:28:41,523
You tell your miss Daisy she's clearly too old for the role

582
00:28:42,371 --> 00:28:43,332
Get her into wardrobe!

583
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,436
Well, that really worked out well

584
00:28:49,923 --> 00:28:50,964
He's creepy

585
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,404
I think I like him

586
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:57,221
A street car named Ophelia

587
00:28:58,325 --> 00:29:00,718
Tis now the very witching time of night

588
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:06,687
when churchyard's yawn hell itself breeds out contagion into this world

589
00:29:07,238 --> 00:29:09,294
Now I could drink hot blood

590
00:29:11,223 --> 00:29:15,503
Oh, with it's noble mind it's here overthrown

591
00:29:17,232 --> 00:29:20,929
Guys, stage left, or my left

592
00:29:21,425 --> 00:29:22,393
Left

593
00:29:22,593 --> 00:29:26,601
How did you know, that I was a vampire, fair Ophelia?

594
00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:29,873
Look at you. Hell is your shirt

595
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:33,426
Your knees knocking each other

596
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:37,211
You don't like the shirt? It's my new design. Sheep's feather

597
00:29:38,155 --> 00:29:40,676
I do not understand your hunger for blood

598
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,780
Why you turn those you love into the vampires

599
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:47,660
Oh but you will understand!

600
00:29:48,316 --> 00:29:51,349
I would ... rather ... die!

601
00:29:51,829 --> 00:29:52,909
Nooo!

602
00:29:53,101 --> 00:29:54,485
Ophelia! Nooo!

603
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:56,918
Ok, ehh

604
00:29:59,405 --> 00:30:02,206
Theo! We got it more dramatic and maybe we can just

605
00:30:02,694 --> 00:30:04,582
turn it down a little

606
00:30:05,614 --> 00:30:07,823
I know of a potion that will help you

607
00:30:08,055 --> 00:30:10,447
if drunk from the Holy Grail

608
00:30:11,008 --> 00:30:16,273
Your soul will be restored and the vampire's curse shall be lifted

609
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,001
I see what ... what you're trying to do there

610
00:30:20,424 --> 00:30:21,761
The only thing is ... I am not

611
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:24,569
I am not really sure vampire's gonna cry that much

612
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,338
All I am saying is this

613
00:30:26,554 --> 00:30:29,938
sometimes I feel like you care more about what Theo has to say

614
00:30:30,267 --> 00:30:33,291
than what Julian, the director, has to say

615
00:30:33,619 --> 00:30:37,219
You know, I know, actors think tears make great acting, but

616
00:30:38,243 --> 00:30:39,971
it kinda makes some look like a huge pussy

617
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,836
I think you have us mistaken for someone else

618
00:30:43,076 --> 00:30:45,348
We are not Rosencrantz and Guildenstern

619
00:30:45,524 --> 00:30:47,565
We are Rosencrutz ...

620
00:30:48,341 --> 00:30:49,797
and Goldenstone

621
00:30:50,373 --> 00:30:50,997
yes

622
00:30:51,357 --> 00:30:53,309
Fucking pantaloons

623
00:30:53,637 --> 00:30:58,438
If you let us go, we will share a great and powerful secret with you

624
00:30:58,854 --> 00:31:02,854
Actually what he refers to, is the location of the Holy Grail

625
00:31:03,646 --> 00:31:04,886
This play is really confusing

626
00:31:05,686 --> 00:31:07,319
Let's talk later

627
00:31:08,391 --> 00:31:11,880
Rosencrutz and Goldenstern are dead

628
00:31:12,512 --> 00:31:14,200
Ah, where are their skeletons?

629
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,432
They burst into flames and dissappeared

630
00:31:18,241 --> 00:31:19,312
Wait

631
00:31:19,681 --> 00:31:21,625
Do you know of any good playwrights?

632
00:31:21,977 --> 00:31:24,545
To be, or not to be ...

633
00:31:25,641 --> 00:31:28,554
That is the ...

634
00:31:30,826 --> 00:31:32,259
dilema?

635
00:31:32,763 --> 00:31:34,379
It's good guys, we'll get there

636
00:31:35,707 --> 00:31:36,618
eventually

637
00:31:37,075 --> 00:31:40,073
The Grail's hiding place is in this passage from scripture

638
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:46,377
Take Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to help you find it

639
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,242
Great guys, that was good

640
00:31:51,874 --> 00:31:53,243
So, that's where you kiss

641
00:31:54,515 --> 00:31:55,499
Why are you interrupting?

642
00:31:55,611 --> 00:31:56,379
Dude

643
00:31:56,811 --> 00:31:59,116
Great over here, Vince great

644
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:03,628
Theo, I don't think that's how vampire would really do it

645
00:32:04,036 --> 00:32:04,732
Hm?

646
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,988
You know on, on the day I remember, you're gonna have fangs

647
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:10,781
You know, like ... homework assigment

648
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:15,054
Go to a costume store , buy some cheap fangs, they'll be like couple bucks

649
00:32:15,262 --> 00:32:18,702
and just for whole day walk around with these things in your mouth

650
00:32:18,886 --> 00:32:19,950
like you're vampire

651
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,262
Argh

652
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:22,912
You're a killer. You know

653
00:32:29,257 --> 00:32:30,906
You're giving me chills, Theo

654
00:32:31,162 --> 00:32:33,242
You'll do it like that, you'll gonna knock them fucking dead

655
00:32:38,287 --> 00:32:39,159
Yeah, I ... I've believed it

656
00:32:38,096 --> 00:32:38,720
Dial S for Shakespiracy

657
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,840
Brrrraa, ma ma maa

658
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:43,617
Now I could drink hot blood

659
00:32:46,304 --> 00:32:47,793
Now I could drink hot ...

660
00:32:49,586 --> 00:32:50,802
... blood

661
00:32:55,411 --> 00:32:57,500
Now I could drink hot blood?

662
00:32:58,715 --> 00:32:59,475
Hot blood?

663
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:03,332
If you were ever in the play with the vampires and Hamlet

664
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:06,436
You call the number on the side of this pen

665
00:33:07,325 --> 00:33:09,133
You are in danger!

666
00:33:25,479 --> 00:33:27,576
Hello, Rosencrucians and Goldenstone, how may I help you

667
00:33:28,152 --> 00:33:28,912
Hi, yeah

668
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,697
I am in a play with Hamlet and vampires

669
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,169
Vampires and Hamlet, I'll patch you through

670
00:33:43,882 --> 00:33:45,858
An apple a day keeps the demons away

671
00:33:48,891 --> 00:33:49,755
Oh my god, it's you

672
00:33:49,923 --> 00:33:52,026
What, what is this, what's with this, I thought you were supposed to be a homeless

673
00:33:52,275 --> 00:33:54,923
That was a disguise, I work for a secret society

674
00:33:55,275 --> 00:33:56,475
Yes, yes, no, hey, look, that's great

675
00:33:56,763 --> 00:33:58,956
They could be watching me right now, so we don't have a lot of time

676
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:03,376
The story we're speaking, the vampire puts on the play to trap a large group of victims

677
00:34:03,592 --> 00:34:04,944
and feed on them

678
00:34:05,529 --> 00:34:07,177
Oh, fuck not, that's great

679
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,497
Are they gonna feed on me?

680
00:34:08,721 --> 00:34:11,458
No, every actor in the play will be turned into a vampire

681
00:34:11,818 --> 00:34:13,570
to save on the costs of special effects

682
00:34:13,898 --> 00:34:16,266
and a torso gives the play an authenticity

683
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:19,298
Charlotte, I can't die, this is terrible timing for me

684
00:34:19,506 --> 00:34:21,811
I am in the prime of my life, I am playing Hamlet right now

685
00:34:22,211 --> 00:34:23,171
Hamlet!

686
00:34:24,091 --> 00:34:27,180
On the lonely seas, you shall find prince Hamlet

687
00:34:27,332 --> 00:34:31,141
and bring him back to me

688
00:34:31,284 --> 00:34:34,228
Theo cannot know that you know, if he asks you questions,

689
00:34:34,396 --> 00:34:39,741
don't answer. Repeat what he says as if you don't understand, with a question mark

690
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:41,246
What with a question mark?

691
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:42,310
Oh, that's perfect

692
00:34:42,606 --> 00:34:44,895
A paper is not safe if I am captured

693
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:45,913
*Pirates threat*

694
00:34:46,049 --> 00:34:47,090
You two cowards, come here quickly

695
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,258
Closer, closer

696
00:34:52,309 --> 00:34:54,229
That's great, that's just great, I knew it

697
00:34:54,486 --> 00:34:55,445
I am gonna have to quit the play

698
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:57,085
I am gonna have to quit the play!

699
00:34:57,326 --> 00:34:58,261
It's too late for that

700
00:34:58,525 --> 00:35:00,214
You and your friends are as good as undead

701
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,118
I am feeling all tingly inside

702
00:35:02,406 --> 00:35:05,255
unless you follow my instructions exactly

703
00:35:06,287 --> 00:35:09,576
The vampires hate garlic, it's one of the many random rules

704
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:13,928
Aye, aye. I said to get some pizza ...

705
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,409
with some garlic

706
00:35:16,752 --> 00:35:19,289
Nextime you want to break for lunch, you ask first

707
00:35:19,505 --> 00:35:20,713
and then we'll all break at the same time

708
00:35:20,921 --> 00:35:22,209
I hope you bought enough for everyone

709
00:35:22,449 --> 00:35:23,145
Yeah, yeah

710
00:35:23,282 --> 00:35:25,210
Ok, so tell me this, genious, if Theo is a vampire

711
00:35:25,346 --> 00:35:26,890
how come the sunlight doesn't bother him?

712
00:35:27,082 --> 00:35:29,978
Many have mutated, garlic is one of the only things

713
00:35:30,538 --> 00:35:32,546
that still repels them

714
00:35:32,746 --> 00:35:34,699
Whooh. What's a pizza without garlic

715
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,107
You know, that's my mother used to say

716
00:35:36,299 --> 00:35:39,220
Put it in your food, you must always be eating garlic

717
00:35:40,212 --> 00:35:41,764
Hmm, hmm hm hmm

718
00:35:42,253 --> 00:35:44,093
That's good

719
00:35:44,261 --> 00:35:46,197
Why, why you're helping me?

720
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:49,917
I work for a secret society, that deals with your cult

721
00:35:50,413 --> 00:35:53,549
Demons, spares, everlasting life, et cetera

722
00:35:57,262 --> 00:36:01,095
Allright, if you want me, vile wenches of the depths

723
00:36:02,143 --> 00:36:03,231
then take me now

724
00:36:03,976 --> 00:36:05,847
Look how easily the prince gives up

725
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:08,239
How weird he's never been in a fight

726
00:36:08,504 --> 00:36:10,752
Me thinks he's never had his arms cut off

727
00:36:15,521 --> 00:36:17,913
Great, don't fix it, if it's not broken

728
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:20,474
I don't work with him, until he brushes his teeth or something

729
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:24,722
His breath is so disgusting he deserves to die

730
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,122
Hey, Zadeska, that's a little bit harsh, don't you think?

731
00:36:28,482 --> 00:36:29,154
Ok, come on

732
00:36:29,682 --> 00:36:30,938
Oh, Jesus man, you stink

733
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,098
I know, I know, can I talk to you for one second, please?

734
00:36:34,434 --> 00:36:36,234
Thank you, great. Fuck it

735
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,547
Ehm, I ... yeah, I know

736
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:42,863
I think that Theo, is a real Horatio

737
00:36:43,294 --> 00:36:45,215
I know, he's a really good actor, it's actually pretty inspiring

738
00:36:45,487 --> 00:36:46,350
No, no, no, no

739
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:47,166
You really stink

740
00:36:47,255 --> 00:36:48,255
I know I stink! I have to eat garlic

741
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:51,231
We had to quit the play

742
00:36:51,383 --> 00:36:51,943
What?

743
00:36:52,183 --> 00:36:52,944
We ...

744
00:36:53,984 --> 00:36:55,680
We have to quit ... the play!

745
00:36:55,944 --> 00:36:56,696
What do you talking about?

746
00:36:58,392 --> 00:36:59,425
We have to quit the play!

747
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:00,609
We have to quit the play!

748
00:37:00,873 --> 00:37:04,377
Hey, hey, get it together man. You gonna blow this for us

749
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:05,226
Jules

750
00:37:05,449 --> 00:37:07,945
Try to remember that the best acting is not acting

751
00:37:10,738 --> 00:37:11,698
Why, was I overacting?

752
00:37:13,323 --> 00:37:15,995
As I lay undying

753
00:37:16,555 --> 00:37:20,092
Oh, Horatio, you don't care about life

754
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,251
Naive you are, you just want to destroy the Grail,

755
00:37:23,395 --> 00:37:24,412
but I have hidden it

756
00:37:25,132 --> 00:37:29,085
I have hidden the paper that tells of its location with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern

757
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:30,725
whom you shall never find

758
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:32,894
Now, die!

759
00:37:34,246 --> 00:37:36,278
Wha, ha, silly prince!

760
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,254
one vampire cannot kill another

761
00:37:40,022 --> 00:37:44,022
since we are both cut from the same evil demon

762
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,975
Goddamned, you know who's gonna get cutted, paleface

763
00:37:48,495 --> 00:37:50,928
You! Cause I know Theo, I know what you are!

764
00:37:55,888 --> 00:37:56,824
No, no, no, Zadeska

765
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:58,880
Allright, Zadesca that's

766
00:37:59,088 --> 00:37:59,793
No, no, what are you doing?

767
00:37:59,921 --> 00:38:01,777
Horatio had turned Hamlet into vampire in earlier scene

768
00:38:02,097 --> 00:38:03,506
Zadeska, did you read this play?

769
00:38:04,258 --> 00:38:05,226
No, no, oh what?

770
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:07,354
I

771
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,522
said

772
00:38:08,994 --> 00:38:10,227
no!

773
00:38:11,643 --> 00:38:12,523
Are you ok?

774
00:38:14,146 --> 00:38:15,723
We don't treat actresses like that!

775
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:18,051
She was being disobidient

776
00:38:18,372 --> 00:38:19,740
I thought that was what you're wanted

777
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:22,212
I was only trying to protect you, master

778
00:38:22,684 --> 00:38:25,869
Hey, I think you might be getting a little bit into the character

779
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,093
He's not breathing!

780
00:38:28,429 --> 00:38:29,221
What?

781
00:38:31,285 --> 00:38:33,965
Come on, Vince, open your eyes. I know that you're there

782
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:37,815
If you were to been may deceased by this unfortunate mishap

783
00:38:37,975 --> 00:38:39,279
well well then oh well,

784
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:40,743
but I know that's not the case!

785
00:38:41,951 --> 00:38:43,352
I can feel you

786
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:45,392
I can feel you!

787
00:38:46,552 --> 00:38:47,584
Did I do good, master?

788
00:38:47,712 --> 00:38:49,064
No, you did not do good!

789
00:38:49,568 --> 00:38:51,448
It's taken too long, now everyone thinks he's dead

790
00:38:51,656 --> 00:38:52,688
he can't be in the play

791
00:38:53,336 --> 00:38:54,985
We've already have all these posters made

792
00:38:59,898 --> 00:39:01,970
Doctor said it was just a spider bite

793
00:39:02,714 --> 00:39:03,938
Seems so weird

794
00:39:04,187 --> 00:39:05,914
Well, that must have been a really big spider, dog

795
00:39:06,514 --> 00:39:07,250
Like what a?

796
00:39:07,594 --> 00:39:09,147
I don't think he was married bro

797
00:39:09,634 --> 00:39:11,987
Damn, dude, like, fuck, dog

798
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:14,084
He's still very upset about Vince

799
00:39:15,028 --> 00:39:16,716
Something else's been bothering me too

800
00:39:17,924 --> 00:39:19,409
Does my beard working for my character?

801
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:22,923
I mean I looked it up all night, it's very shakespearian

802
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:24,884
But, you know, I am not married to it

803
00:39:25,452 --> 00:39:26,276
What I am saying?

804
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,844
Can we talk about this later?

805
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:31,285
Yeah, let's table this till maybe after the funeral?

806
00:39:36,062 --> 00:39:41,582
Anna, I want you to know, that even in these darkest of times

807
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:46,922
Your heavenly presence could make even the dead feel alive

808
00:39:47,394 --> 00:39:48,266
Thank you Theo

809
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:49,970
Easy buddy, she's with me

810
00:39:50,506 --> 00:39:51,243
Of course

811
00:39:51,443 --> 00:39:53,586
That's just the way I act around the gorgeous woman

812
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,995
Yeah, well, act a little smaller, ok, powder face

813
00:39:57,619 --> 00:39:58,915
Unless you want to play part of the corpse

814
00:40:01,075 --> 00:40:04,988
And Anna, I hope that you won't let this unfortunate incident prevent you

815
00:40:05,252 --> 00:40:07,693
from fullfilling your role as Ophelia

816
00:40:08,349 --> 00:40:09,692
No, I won't quit

817
00:40:11,341 --> 00:40:12,517
You happy now, fancy pance

818
00:40:13,901 --> 00:40:14,789
My name is Charlotte Lawrence

819
00:40:15,965 --> 00:40:17,958
I am part of the secret society, that needs your help

820
00:40:18,478 --> 00:40:19,151
Hm?

821
00:40:19,406 --> 00:40:20,790
I know what happened to Vince

822
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,639
You're in the middle of the two thousand years old conspiracy

823
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:26,320
If you have any question, watch this DVD

824
00:40:27,503 --> 00:40:29,343
Meet me at the central, first thing tomorow morning

825
00:40:29,831 --> 00:40:32,745
If anyone asks where you're going, you must lie to them

826
00:40:33,312 --> 00:40:35,168
I am not very good liar

827
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,232
Just! Ok

828
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:38,537
Tell them you have dentist appoitment or something

829
00:40:39,113 --> 00:40:40,457
We don't have much time

830
00:40:42,434 --> 00:40:44,882
Rosencrucians and Goldenstone

831
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,066
What did the priest say?

832
00:40:47,242 --> 00:40:53,083
Oh, ah. Nothing really, you know she just said a few Hail Marys and Our Fathers kind of thing

833
00:40:53,395 --> 00:40:54,267
She?

834
00:40:54,795 --> 00:41:00,525
He! You know, she like the religious she

835
00:41:01,516 --> 00:41:04,460
Listen, Julian, there's no way to recast the play this late date

836
00:41:04,692 --> 00:41:06,660
unfortunately you'll have to play Hamlet now

837
00:41:10,149 --> 00:41:11,709
Thanks for the kind words, Theo

838
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:20,270
That Theo guy, he's pretty creepy, hm?

839
00:41:21,703 --> 00:41:24,215
I think he's probably a hesbian too. What do you think?

840
00:41:25,607 --> 00:41:27,656
You don't know what hesbian means, do you?

841
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,568
You're flirting with him

842
00:41:30,216 --> 00:41:31,505
You attracted to him?

843
00:41:32,801 --> 00:41:33,761
What do you want me to say?

844
00:41:34,073 --> 00:41:36,378
You suppose to say "I wasn't flirting with him, you idiot!"

845
00:41:37,241 --> 00:41:38,994
I wasn't flirting with him, you idiot!

846
00:41:39,161 --> 00:41:40,465
It does not work now!

847
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:42,762
Hey, honey, just thought, you know

848
00:41:42,938 --> 00:41:45,826
we could, unwine, what do you say baby, come on

849
00:41:47,163 --> 00:41:48,915
Not after Vince's funeral

850
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:50,811
Hey, I liked him too, but he was a liar

851
00:41:52,444 --> 00:41:53,901
I had to do a background check

852
00:41:54,268 --> 00:41:55,243
And you know what, I was right

853
00:41:55,507 --> 00:41:57,132
He wasn't even gay

854
00:41:57,516 --> 00:41:58,988
You did a background check on him?

855
00:41:59,492 --> 00:42:00,116
Hey

856
00:42:00,252 --> 00:42:01,164
That's demented

857
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,621
What, I did that with everybody

858
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:06,901
Vince, just think of the afterlife as an audition

859
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:10,230
You got the part, man. You gonna be great in the role

860
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,534
Hey, you know, you're not the only one around here with depressing news, you know that?!

861
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:20,071
I just found out, that my shipment of ten thousand Germ-o-Whacks has got returned, ok?

862
00:42:21,663 --> 00:42:22,688
That insult!

863
00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:24,744
Was a no brainer!

864
00:42:25,656 --> 00:42:26,584
What is that?

865
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,017
What, that, ai ey ... it's a, er, espresso machine

866
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:35,769
Have you've been filming us having sex?

867
00:42:37,281 --> 00:42:38,466
Come on. So what?

868
00:42:38,906 --> 00:42:41,162
So what? And you think Theo's a creep?

869
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:42,955
Honey

870
00:42:45,203 --> 00:42:46,451
Wait, ok. Honey, that is important

871
00:42:46,707 --> 00:42:47,827
Harvy, hold on, hold on

872
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:51,603
Listen, honey, let me talk. Hold on, hold on a second

873
00:42:51,851 --> 00:42:52,868
Let me talk to you

874
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,253
I don't wanna hold on any more

875
00:42:55,549 --> 00:42:56,925
I am leaving you

876
00:42:58,893 --> 00:43:00,791
Hey, if you're going out, could you bring back some soya milk?

877
00:43:01,501 --> 00:43:04,037
And a ... a. Just some soya milk

878
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:07,702
Harvy, I need you to do some research on this guy

879
00:43:08,023 --> 00:43:11,991
His name is Theo Horace. Some kind of vampire fanatic

880
00:43:39,859 --> 00:43:41,364
Please, don't turn the TV on. It hurts my eyes

881
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:42,772
Then don't watch it

882
00:43:43,188 --> 00:43:44,492
It's for my job, sorry

883
00:43:45,116 --> 00:43:52,541
Hello, you are being initiated into level one of Rosencrucianism and Goldenstoness

884
00:43:52,781 --> 00:43:53,757
What is this?

885
00:43:54,589 --> 00:43:55,358
Psh

886
00:43:56,702 --> 00:43:59,822
The first written evedence of our secret society

887
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:07,392
is the rosencrucian and goldenstonian manifesto published in 1615

888
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:14,176
The author claims that he was inspired by an encounter with two vampires

889
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,289
named Rosencrutz and Goldenstone

890
00:44:20,921 --> 00:44:26,365
They described a four hundred year old duel over the Holy Grail

891
00:44:26,701 --> 00:44:31,590
between a master Vampire named Horatio and his nemesis

892
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,454
the former vampire

893
00:44:33,726 --> 00:44:35,230
prince Hamlet

894
00:44:35,527 --> 00:44:41,159
Who drunk from the Holy Grail curing himself of the vampire curse

895
00:44:42,191 --> 00:44:46,328
then traveled around the world erasing much of Horatio's legacy

896
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:51,905
curing another vampires of their curse, turning them back into humans

897
00:44:52,457 --> 00:44:55,697
while still retaining his own everlasting life

898
00:44:57,769 --> 00:45:03,962
Today, a vampire Horatio is known as playwright, Theo Horace

899
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:09,307
Who always hires young, controllable human to direct his plays

900
00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:11,932
and turns every actress in his play

901
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,956
into a vampire bride

902
00:45:14,643 --> 00:45:20,240
We believe, that Hamlet resigned himself for giving Horatio one last chance

903
00:45:20,432 --> 00:45:25,008
to save his soul and that on opening night of Horatio's latest play

904
00:45:25,504 --> 00:45:29,609
Hamlet will confront Horatio and his crusade will end

905
00:45:30,354 --> 00:45:37,058
giving our society a chance at long last to gain possesion of the Holy Grail

906

908
00:45:52,063 --> 00:45:54,176
Thanks and have a nice day

909
00:46:03,952 --> 00:46:06,080
Is this some form of experimental treatment?

910
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,041
Hi, guys

911
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:13,505
Anna

912
00:46:15,353 --> 00:46:16,865
Hugo, please

913
00:46:26,371 --> 00:46:27,202
Hi

914
00:46:27,754 --> 00:46:28,714
Hey

915
00:46:29,811 --> 00:46:30,995
Hey

916
00:46:31,867 --> 00:46:33,123
I'm really sad

917
00:46:34,796 --> 00:46:36,180
You look really beautiful

918
00:46:38,709 --> 00:46:40,117
I think that's making me more sad

919
00:46:47,193 --> 00:46:50,106
What happened to Vince was ... made me think differently about everything

920
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:53,618
That is so weird

921
00:46:54,874 --> 00:46:56,331
I wish we could live forever

922
00:46:57,178 --> 00:46:58,522
together

923
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:02,083
but we can't

924
00:47:05,747 --> 00:47:07,012
All we have is this moment

925
00:47:51,487 --> 00:47:53,127
Hi, Vince

926
00:48:00,681 --> 00:48:02,529
Hi, Vince

927
00:48:24,811 --> 00:48:27,179
Vince's transformation took far too long

928
00:48:29,428 --> 00:48:33,392
I am going to send Liden with you tonight to kill him

929
00:48:35,928 --> 00:48:37,440
You must learn to do it more quickly

930
00:48:40,248 --> 00:48:43,529
Maybe one of us is going to be promoted to play Hamlet, dog?

931
00:48:43,881 --> 00:48:44,945
Well that is definitely me

932
00:48:45,105 --> 00:48:46,721
Eh, why is it definitely you?

933
00:48:47,025 --> 00:48:50,986
Because, I am pretty sure Hamlet wasn't some sort of spanish male whore

934
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:53,307
We're going to try a little ...

935
00:48:53,923 --> 00:48:54,851
... exercise

936
00:48:55,611 --> 00:49:00,883
Relax, close your eyes, lie down

937
00:49:04,196 --> 00:49:05,436
More practices, dog?

938
00:49:05,716 --> 00:49:06,516
Yes, dog

939
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,629
Theo, I was thinking, since we're doing an extra reherseal

940
00:49:08,797 --> 00:49:10,734
perhaps we could get an extra scale payment

941
00:49:11,253 --> 00:49:12,101
No!

942
00:49:12,398 --> 00:49:13,470
Ok

943
00:49:15,005 --> 00:49:18,470
But, you're going to enjoy this

944
00:49:20,414 --> 00:49:21,790
Straddle them

945
00:49:22,455 --> 00:49:23,751
This is like kind of kinky, dog

946
00:49:24,231 --> 00:49:27,223
Now, girls, it's imperative that you send to your thoughts

947
00:49:27,888 --> 00:49:30,768
and focus on your objective

948
00:49:31,216 --> 00:49:32,560
Dig in

949
00:49:33,088 --> 00:49:38,417
Now let your blood mingle, as you feel the beat

950
00:49:39,121 --> 00:49:41,257
two, three, four

951
00:49:41,689 --> 00:49:44,762
Let your blood mingle, three four

952
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:47,923
passion, not emotion, three four

953
00:49:48,315 --> 00:49:51,659
one, two, three, four

954
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:53,419
Crescendo!

955
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:55,643
Release!

956
00:50:01,492 --> 00:50:02,965
Good

957
00:50:03,725 --> 00:50:05,517
That was fast

958
00:50:10,933 --> 00:50:14,678
The importance of being honest

959
00:50:19,111 --> 00:50:21,319
This is a weird place for dentist office

960
00:50:21,911 --> 00:50:25,359
Yeah, it's the only place that takes my insurance

961
00:50:27,648 --> 00:50:30,129
What's a Rosicrucian and Goldenstone?

962
00:50:30,584 --> 00:50:35,033
Oh, eh, it's probably like old english for

963
00:50:35,417 --> 00:50:37,978
root canal and gold crown

964
00:50:38,586 --> 00:50:40,467
I'll be like ten minutes

965
00:50:40,882 --> 00:50:42,290
It takes ten minutes?

966
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:43,810
Yeah, everything's premade here

967
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:45,514
it's another cool thing about this place

968
00:50:53,228 --> 00:50:54,372
Thank you for coming, Julian

969
00:50:55,196 --> 00:50:56,476
I ain't come here for thank yous

970
00:50:57,861 --> 00:50:59,460
I wanna know why my best friend is dead

971
00:50:59,948 --> 00:51:04,397
I am sorry, but the truth is that everyone involved in a vampire's play dies

972
00:51:04,565 --> 00:51:06,198
or becomes a vampire themselves

973
00:51:07,158 --> 00:51:08,070
Except the director

974
00:51:08,502 --> 00:51:09,286
Tea?

975
00:51:09,478 --> 00:51:10,166
Me?

976
00:51:10,286 --> 00:51:11,446
We, yes, like could make more hot water

977
00:51:11,591 --> 00:51:13,135
No, I mean, me the director? Why?

978
00:51:13,647 --> 00:51:17,375
There are certain rules, that exists between heaven and hell that can't be broken

979
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:21,359
Just as a vampire cannot enter your home without being invited

980
00:51:21,736 --> 00:51:23,840
he cannot put on a vampire play

981
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:28,641
unless it is introduced by a human whose blood has not yet been tainted

982
00:51:28,921 --> 00:51:30,337
I know, we're making a vampire play

983
00:51:30,705 --> 00:51:32,938
Theo's play is authobiographical

984
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:34,281
Shit!

985
00:51:34,433 --> 00:51:36,089
Doesn't anyone make anything up anymore

986
00:51:36,313 --> 00:51:38,074
You need this wooden stake to protect yourself

987
00:51:38,258 --> 00:51:40,962
because after opening night they'll have no use for you

988
00:51:41,202 --> 00:51:43,251
Well, I take an offense there, I don't thinks that's true

989
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,851
We work very hard at the theater

990
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:47,132
Theo will make your exgirlfriend his bride

991
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,188
He's gonna propose to her?

992
00:51:48,332 --> 00:51:49,172
Fine, she'll say no

993
00:51:49,292 --> 00:51:51,565
She will be immortal like him, they will live forever

994
00:51:51,876 --> 00:51:54,508
Are you trying to make me jealous right now, because it's kind of working

995
00:51:54,652 --> 00:51:58,461
If jealousy motivates you, then let it fuel your fire

996
00:51:58,981 --> 00:52:00,445
You lied about the dentist

997
00:52:00,661 --> 00:52:02,638
Anna, just calm down, hey look, I'll buy you flowers

998
00:52:02,926 --> 00:52:04,342
You're not supposed to tell me first

999
00:52:04,606 --> 00:52:07,471
Hi Theo, wanna take a walk or grab a milkshake

1000
00:52:07,735 --> 00:52:11,307
That would be the best milksshake of my life

1001
00:52:11,659 --> 00:52:12,747
Wouldn't ... you're lactose intolerant

1002
00:52:13,515 --> 00:52:14,675
I almost forgot, this is for you

1003
00:52:14,883 --> 00:52:15,875
Oh, give me a break

1004
00:52:16,051 --> 00:52:16,771
Thank you

1005
00:52:17,028 --> 00:52:17,812
I love roses

1006
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:18,805
She loves roses, Julian

1007
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:19,495
Theo's a vampire

1008
00:52:19,615 --> 00:52:20,215
A vampire!

1009
00:52:22,327 --> 00:52:23,632
You mean Horatio, don't you?

1010
00:52:24,656 --> 00:52:26,528
He's been working too hard, boy, boy

1011
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,016
Leyuba

1012
00:52:30,072 --> 00:52:31,728
I have been working really hard

1013
00:52:38,194 --> 00:52:39,810
Why ... why'd you stop?

1014
00:52:51,963 --> 00:52:52,988
Julian

1015
00:52:53,596 --> 00:52:54,260
Hey

1016
00:52:54,492 --> 00:52:55,348
Get in the car

1017
00:52:55,476 --> 00:52:57,741
I ... yeah, that's cool. I think I just gonna walk

1018
00:52:57,997 --> 00:52:59,589
Get in the car ... now!

1019
00:53:00,629 --> 00:53:03,134
This feels a little, like I've seen from the Godfather

1020
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:06,850
No offense, I don't even know why I said that

1021
00:53:07,178 --> 00:53:08,946
Just relax, I am not gonna hurt you

1022
00:53:10,225 --> 00:53:11,690
I just need talk to you somewhere in private

1023
00:53:12,138 --> 00:53:13,450
There's no way I am getting in that car

1024
00:53:19,555 --> 00:53:21,027
Do you love Anna?

1025
00:53:21,292 --> 00:53:23,492
Ah, mister Bianchi, I am sure I don't know what that means

1026
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,628
Do you care for Anna enough to risk your life to save her?

1027
00:53:25,804 --> 00:53:26,981
that's what I'm asking ya

1028
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:28,732
Mister, mister Bianchi ... don Bianchi

1029
00:53:28,996 --> 00:53:30,948
ah ... I thought you said you weren't gonna hurt me

1030
00:53:31,236 --> 00:53:34,325
I am not gonna hurt you. I know you lied to me about being gay

1031
00:53:34,581 --> 00:53:36,798
but I am pass that, I know you were scared of me

1032
00:53:37,582 --> 00:53:39,284
Sometimes I speak and I don't think about it first

1033
00:53:39,533 --> 00:53:39,941
Whatever

1034
00:53:40,173 --> 00:53:40,741
I don't mean any disrespect

1035
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:42,260
I mean ...

1036
00:53:42,781 --> 00:53:44,935
Let's whack some fucking vampires!

1037
00:53:46,839 --> 00:53:48,463
Yes, let's. What do you talking about?

1038
00:53:48,895 --> 00:53:50,415
And I got holding water in it

1039
00:53:50,615 --> 00:53:51,680
Holy water

1040
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,464
And some other surprises ... do you ... do you know anything about how to kill these things?

1041
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,201
Eh ... from what I've been told, I think you can kill them with a stake

1042
00:53:58,561 --> 00:54:01,122
They can drink all that raw blood, but they can't handle a stake?

1043
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:03,490
No, no, no, not that kind of stake

1044
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:05,779
This kind of stake

1045
00:54:06,603 --> 00:54:08,947
Whoa, yes, yes, see that, that's sick

1046
00:54:09,195 --> 00:54:11,220
That is sick, man, that is nasty!

1047
00:54:13,204 --> 00:54:15,555
My new invention is gonna come in handy, finally

1048
00:54:15,827 --> 00:54:17,468
How is that gonna do anything, it's just a watergun

1049
00:54:18,284 --> 00:54:20,372
Fuck, I'll break your, fuck

1050
00:54:21,973 --> 00:54:23,469
Break your fucking head open!

1051
00:54:23,901 --> 00:54:27,270
I am sorry, it's clearly so much more than just a watergun

1052
00:54:27,919 --> 00:54:31,176
Long day's journey into fright

1053
00:54:40,183 --> 00:54:41,216
Steady now

1054
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:42,704
Weird, isn't it

1055
00:54:43,264 --> 00:54:45,311
Art imitates life

1056
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,400
In your case - death

1057
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:53,848
I always loved Alice in wonderland when I was young

1058
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,896
So weird that the most famous children story was written by a pedophile

1059
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:06,480
Tis true. The most best books are written by sinners

1060
00:55:06,968 --> 00:55:09,087
and the most romantic by men who

1061
00:55:10,249 --> 00:55:11,920
cannot actually love

1062
00:55:12,504 --> 00:55:15,743
This is so eerie. I forgot how much cemetaries creep me out

1063
00:55:16,016 --> 00:55:19,192
You're a vampire, Zadeska. Creepines is sort of part of the job

1064
00:55:19,485 --> 00:55:20,743
Would you let me focus?!

1065
00:55:21,511 --> 00:55:22,792
Somewhere over here?

1066
00:55:23,288 --> 00:55:24,777
What ... what happened to Vince's body?

1067
00:55:25,127 --> 00:55:26,768
My private detective said Vince got out

1068
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,886
What does it even mean, Vince got out?

1069
00:55:29,342 --> 00:55:30,421
You know what I mean

1070
00:55:30,591 --> 00:55:32,325
Vince is a freaking vampire, you dipshit

1071
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:35,028
Like, what you're saying, he just pushes his coffin out of the ground?

1072
00:55:35,264 --> 00:55:36,360
Where the hell's Harvy?

1073
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,584
He's being digested

1074
00:55:39,768 --> 00:55:41,319
Stay close, they can't hurt me

1075
00:55:41,512 --> 00:55:42,744
They can't hurt the director of play

1076
00:55:43,016 --> 00:55:44,911
Hey, I think you've got a delusions of grandier there, kiddo

1077
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:45,952
Get out your Germ-o-Whack!

1078
00:55:46,296 --> 00:55:48,902
I was in love once

1079
00:55:50,752 --> 00:55:52,871
... with Ophelia

1080
00:55:53,344 --> 00:55:55,911
I was in love with Charles and Charge, so ...

1081
00:55:56,351 --> 00:55:57,495
No, Anna

1082
00:55:58,311 --> 00:56:02,783
the real Ophelia, the one who died seven hundred years ago

1083
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:05,391
All this time, I've been searching for her

1084
00:56:05,832 --> 00:56:09,906
Anna. You are the key that could free me from this cage

1085
00:56:10,263 --> 00:56:11,656
But you're not in a cage

1086
00:56:12,015 --> 00:56:12,999
Without your love

1087
00:56:13,607 --> 00:56:16,176
All the world is a cage

1088
00:56:17,861 --> 00:56:18,837
Why is nothing happening?

1089
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:20,445
I thought you said there was holy water in it

1090
00:56:20,725 --> 00:56:21,980
I can't believe that priest lied to me

1091
00:56:23,056 --> 00:56:24,264
I'll kill him

1092
00:56:32,725 --> 00:56:34,501
Hm, you don't like crucifix, hey, crazy bitch

1093
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:35,860
Bobby, the stake!

1094
00:56:36,397 --> 00:56:37,172
Where is it?

1095
00:56:37,309 --> 00:56:38,149
It's on your left

1096
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,597
Shit, I got it!

1097
00:56:40,229 --> 00:56:41,677
You like to attack on my friend?

1098
00:56:42,613 --> 00:56:43,869
Right back at you!

1099
00:56:54,348 --> 00:56:55,741
We should go

1100
00:56:56,101 --> 00:56:57,373
Don't fight it

1101
00:56:58,045 --> 00:56:58,837
You're mine now

1102
00:56:59,988 --> 00:57:01,084
It is our fate

1103
00:57:11,077 --> 00:57:13,109
Holy shit, wow

1104
00:57:15,148 --> 00:57:16,541
I've never killed anybody before

1105
00:57:17,885 --> 00:57:20,693
But ... I guess she was dead already, right?

1106
00:57:22,053 --> 00:57:23,773
I thought ... I thought you were in the mafia

1107
00:57:25,013 --> 00:57:28,158
What? Just because I am Italian American wealthy, you think I am in Mafia?

1108
00:57:28,732 --> 00:57:30,494
It's always the same fucking stereotype

1109
00:57:30,709 --> 00:57:32,204
you people make me sick!

1110
00:57:32,757 --> 00:57:34,005
Where the fuck the other one go?

1111
00:57:34,854 --> 00:57:36,228
I am going home to get some rest

1112
00:57:41,205 --> 00:57:43,877
Hey, kitty. What? Neighbour throw you out?

1113
00:57:44,949 --> 00:57:46,933
Hey, you can keep me company at night?

1114
00:57:47,581 --> 00:57:49,046
Could use a little company

1115
00:57:49,822 --> 00:57:51,109
The cats like soya milk?

1116
00:57:54,397 --> 00:57:55,733
There you go

1117
00:58:05,517 --> 00:58:07,060
Somebody misses their girlfriend?

1118
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:08,381
Oh shit!

1119
00:58:08,605 --> 00:58:10,901
Vampires are not allowed in somebody's house unless they're invited

1120
00:58:11,181 --> 00:58:11,982
You've just invited me in

1121
00:58:12,415 --> 00:58:13,008
Fucking cat!

1122
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:18,015
Goddamn it!

1123
00:58:18,999 --> 00:58:20,287
How does it feel?

1124
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:44,446
Hello

1125
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:46,367
Hey, Anna, it's me, ok, please don't hang up

1126
00:58:46,831 --> 00:58:48,663
I am really sorry I lied to you yesterday

1127
00:58:49,167 --> 00:58:50,319
I wanna tell you the truth, ok?

1128
00:58:50,687 --> 00:58:53,511
No, no. It's me. I was being a bitch, I am so sorry

1129
00:58:54,294 --> 00:58:56,295
Something was really eating away at me

1130
00:58:56,679 --> 00:58:58,039
You were kind of being a bitch

1131
00:58:59,095 --> 00:59:01,607
Ehm, look. It doesn't matter. I totally forgive you

1132
00:59:01,919 --> 00:59:05,079
Just ... I need you to meet me at Vince's grave like as fast you can get there

1133
00:59:05,303 --> 00:59:06,423
Ok

1134
00:59:06,631 --> 00:59:08,694
Ok, wow. That was easy

1135
00:59:09,214 --> 00:59:10,879
Miss you, I'll talk to you later

1136
00:59:11,671 --> 00:59:12,767
Ok, bye

1137
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:35,687
Wake up!

1138
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,558
Wake up!

1139
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:38,831
Wake up!

1140
00:59:40,247 --> 00:59:41,047
What the hell?

1141
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:44,758
I tied you up and drugged you, but I don't wanna hurt you

1142
00:59:46,095 --> 00:59:47,920
I am standing outside Bobby Bianchi's home

1143
00:59:48,367 --> 00:59:49,287
with the forty old ...

1144
00:59:49,767 --> 00:59:50,663
I've been waiting for an hour and half

1145
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:52,662
this hat has to protect my brain from radiowaves

1146
00:59:54,087 --> 00:59:54,880
Bobby Bianchi?

1147
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:56,478
... inside sources reveal, that ...

1148
00:59:56,639 --> 00:59:57,799
Bobby Bianchi's dead?

1149
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,094
... wooden stake bears the fingerprints of this young man,

1150
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:01,616
Julian Marsh

1151
01:00:01,911 --> 01:00:03,319
Holy fucking shit!

1152
01:00:03,654 --> 01:00:04,672
It's you!

1153
01:00:04,944 --> 01:00:06,123
The motive appears to be, a love triangle

1154
01:00:07,251 --> 01:00:07,995
She killed him?

1155
01:00:08,331 --> 01:00:09,156
No

1156
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:10,476
I can't breathe

1157
01:00:10,643 --> 01:00:11,539
No, I didn't kill anybody

1158
01:00:11,683 --> 01:00:13,243
Shh, quiet, relax! Noone's gonna get hurt

1159
01:00:13,451 --> 01:00:14,347
Aye, mate

1160
01:00:14,491 --> 01:00:15,660
The police are outside

1161
01:00:15,805 --> 01:00:17,155
I need you to meet me in one hour at my headquaters

1162
01:00:18,051 --> 01:00:18,779
Don't shoot him

1163
01:00:19,035 --> 01:00:19,987
We're gonna time up

1164
01:00:22,275 --> 01:00:25,228
The policeman cometh

1165
01:00:25,612 --> 01:00:28,613
I am not saying I liked Bobby Bianchi, you know

1166
01:00:28,829 --> 01:00:31,253
He ... he was criminal

1167
01:00:31,677 --> 01:00:33,926
and ... ehm, you know, he was murdered

1168
01:00:34,206 --> 01:00:35,597
and now that's, my point really is

1169
01:00:35,893 --> 01:00:38,294
the man was murdered and murder is still illegal

1170
01:00:39,286 --> 01:00:42,102
Officers, I will be ... right with you

1171
01:00:42,246 --> 01:00:43,791
This patient is having seizures

1172
01:00:43,975 --> 01:00:45,855
and needs to be rushed to the hospital immediately

1173
01:00:45,967 --> 01:00:47,384
Like, could you please get the door, officer

1174
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:49,592
and I will meet you at the hospital

1175
01:00:56,016 --> 01:00:57,369
So we're looking for doctor Marsh

1176
01:00:57,657 --> 01:00:58,337
I am doctor Marsh

1177
01:00:58,673 --> 01:01:00,122
Ok, great, well

1178
01:01:00,697 --> 01:01:01,954
I am detective Wimbly

1179
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:04,042
We're here, we have a search warrant for the premises ...

1180
01:01:04,923 --> 01:01:06,867
revealing, voila

1181
01:01:07,259 --> 01:01:10,315
And we would like to ask you some questions about your son, Julian

1182
01:01:10,635 --> 01:01:12,763
Right, I will be ... right with you in a moment

1183
01:01:12,931 --> 01:01:15,035
but I need to attend to another seriously ill patient

1184
01:01:15,355 --> 01:01:16,540
Julian's room is over here

1185
01:01:17,132 --> 01:01:17,852
Ok

1186
01:01:18,412 --> 01:01:19,309
So anyway, what I was saying

1187
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:22,501
the real question just to wrap that, that little conversation up ...

1188
01:01:22,758 --> 01:01:24,973
is ... was Bobby Bianchi bad enough

1189
01:01:25,269 --> 01:01:27,502
so that it's good thing that he's dead or ...

1190
01:01:27,734 --> 01:01:30,870
was he good enough that it's bad that he's now dead?

1191
01:01:31,806 --> 01:01:32,926
Wait ... no

1192
01:01:35,494 --> 01:01:37,567
Ya, that's what I meant, so?

1193
01:01:39,391 --> 01:01:41,048
Do ... you know, I mean

1194
01:01:43,128 --> 01:01:45,953
You know what, just, could you go get us some evidence?

1195
01:01:46,201 --> 01:01:48,433
So I can put this sick fuck away

1196
01:02:12,881 --> 01:02:15,112
Gastro intestinal leakage

1197
01:02:20,393 --> 01:02:22,586
Holy shit, fuck man!

1198
01:02:24,234 --> 01:02:25,506
Are you a fucking ninja?!

1199
01:02:27,859 --> 01:02:30,465
Walking through walls now, it really scared me, man

1200
01:02:31,762 --> 01:02:33,906
Oh, look at this, good job

1201
01:02:34,434 --> 01:02:37,206
Wow, look at that, wow, he's a lunatic

1202
01:02:37,484 --> 01:02:38,156
Officers?

1203
01:02:39,044 --> 01:02:42,621
Hey, doc, you know what. Sorry, one minute

1204
01:02:43,195 --> 01:02:46,547
A side note here, what's the deal with this stomach leakage?

1205
01:02:47,003 --> 01:02:48,852
Is that, I didn't know there was possibility

1206
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:50,964
Is this like, something I should be worried

1207
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:54,340
Nah, I had him on warm milk for two weeks and it cleared up

1208
01:02:56,428 --> 01:02:57,180
Thanks

1209
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:59,869
Ok, so your son is crazy, as you probably know

1210
01:03:00,317 --> 01:03:03,238
and we have enough evidence here to plead insanity

1211
01:03:03,454 --> 01:03:04,622
if he turns himself in or

1212
01:03:04,758 --> 01:03:07,630
if you tell us where we can find him

1213
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:09,679
Unit two-three-four-one

1214
01:03:09,863 --> 01:03:13,903
Julian Marsh has been spotted on Malberry street headed towards the cemetary

1215
01:03:13,938 --> 01:03:16,618
Oops, too late. We'll be in touch

1216
01:03:26,715 --> 01:03:28,300
I need you to cooperate and come with me quietly

1217
01:03:29,308 --> 01:03:30,636
I know that your son is innocent

1218
01:03:30,852 --> 01:03:32,420
Aye, he certainly ain't innocent

1219
01:03:32,525 --> 01:03:33,893
but you sure as hell aren't

1220
01:03:34,213 --> 01:03:35,661
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear

1221
01:03:36,365 --> 01:03:38,006
Just because I don't want to hurt you

1222
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:40,358
doesn't mean that I won't

1223
01:03:52,047 --> 01:03:53,343
Ah, Anna, you scared me!

1224
01:03:53,623 --> 01:03:54,200
Hi baby

1225
01:03:54,424 --> 01:03:55,873
Listen, I am sorry I didn't tell you sooner, but

1226
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,072
this is crazy, but Vince is a vamp ...

1227
01:03:58,432 --> 01:03:59,552
Oh my god, what is she ...

1228
01:03:59,672 --> 01:04:00,856
what is she doing here?

1229
01:04:02,585 --> 01:04:03,504
Get the fuck away from me

1230
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:04,681
Guys!

1231
01:04:05,049 --> 01:04:05,849
Hold it right there!

1232
01:04:08,986 --> 01:04:10,731
You're under arrest for the murder of Bobby Bianchi

1233
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:12,122
I've been framed?

1234
01:04:12,434 --> 01:04:13,819
Yeah, ok, you've been framed

1235
01:04:13,955 --> 01:04:15,411
You're gonna tell me next, you've been framed for evident

1236
01:04:15,731 --> 01:04:17,483
freaky threesome in the graveyard, right?

1237
01:04:17,883 --> 01:04:19,259
Cause that's a little too intense

1238
01:04:19,427 --> 01:04:20,187
that's a thing that I was home you

1239
01:04:20,339 --> 01:04:20,502
about being a big city cop

1240
01:04:20,757 --> 01:04:23,438
you've gotta be able to pick up crazy immediately, you know

1241
01:04:24,372 --> 01:04:25,488
Whoa, ok, girls

1242
01:04:26,303 --> 01:04:27,015
Seriously!

1243
01:04:27,847 --> 01:04:29,615
We're policemen, ladies!

1244
01:04:44,457 --> 01:04:45,210
Two officers down

1245
01:04:46,034 --> 01:04:48,105
Call a medic immediately

1246
01:04:55,367 --> 01:04:58,399
So I told him, "Horses don't know what a crucifix is"

1247
01:04:59,543 --> 01:05:02,792
That's so hillarious. You have beautiful hair and teeth

1248
01:05:04,376 --> 01:05:05,431
Why is my dad tied up?

1249
01:05:07,224 --> 01:05:08,992
Guess, we just got to talking

1250
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,489
I am so tied up!

1251
01:05:12,057 --> 01:05:13,281
Why don't we untie him?

1252
01:05:13,585 --> 01:05:14,169
Oh right

1253
01:05:17,162 --> 01:05:18,090
You're son is insane

1254
01:05:18,794 --> 01:05:20,634
He took me to a cemetary. To meet some strippers

1255
01:05:21,018 --> 01:05:22,155
I think they were hookers

1256
01:05:22,818 --> 01:05:25,034
There was an orgy. And then they attacked the cops

1257
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:27,107
Wait a second

1258
01:05:27,955 --> 01:05:30,643
I can breath without a mask. I can see without the glasses

1259
01:05:31,492 --> 01:05:32,652
There's no more sunspots

1260
01:05:33,445 --> 01:05:34,356
It's a miracle

1261
01:05:35,092 --> 01:05:37,405
Thank you. I am cured

1262
01:05:37,661 --> 01:05:38,957
Yeah, that's no problem, Hugo

1263
01:05:40,116 --> 01:05:41,380
Can I get some bread?

1264
01:05:42,133 --> 01:05:44,061
I don't think I can get through this anymore

1265
01:05:44,621 --> 01:05:46,149
It does not matter if I introduce the play or not

1266
01:05:47,718 --> 01:05:49,294
The girl I love is vampire

1267
01:05:50,886 --> 01:05:54,127
With your help, Julian, we will hopefully recover the Grail

1268
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:57,975
and once we have it, you can cure Anna

1269
01:05:58,223 --> 01:05:59,735
It doesn't matter, it's over

1270
01:06:01,111 --> 01:06:02,320
Hugo, why are you tapping me?

1271
01:06:02,568 --> 01:06:05,168
Well, as someone who witnessed your healing powers today

1272
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:06,945
I think you're on a role

1273
01:06:07,177 --> 01:06:08,249
And as a girl

1274
01:06:08,713 --> 01:06:11,650
I can tell you that girls tend to get properly turned on

1275
01:06:12,186 --> 01:06:15,889
when a boy saves their soul from eternal damnation

1276
01:06:16,218 --> 01:06:18,690
Come on, Jules, what's the worst thing that can happen?

1277
01:06:19,026 --> 01:06:20,842
I don't know, dad. Maybe that I die

1278
01:06:21,187 --> 01:06:22,363
or become a vampire

1279
01:06:33,676 --> 01:06:35,212
Have you seen him? Have you seen Julian?

1280
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:37,773
Have you seen him? Is he here?

1281
01:06:38,357 --> 01:06:39,349
He's not here yet

1282
01:06:41,053 --> 01:06:43,878
If he doesn't show, I ... I ... could get some coffee already

1283
01:06:44,078 --> 01:06:44,958
Boss!

1284
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:46,287
Julian ...

1285
01:06:46,407 --> 01:06:49,183
Julian, yes, yes, I know, I am looking for Julian. He's not here

1286
01:06:49,407 --> 01:06:50,302
Julian

1287
01:06:51,439 --> 01:06:52,671
Spit it out!

1288
01:06:52,833 --> 01:06:53,257
He's here

1289
01:06:54,337 --> 01:06:55,161
He's here?

1290
01:06:55,265 --> 01:06:56,009
He's here

1291
01:06:56,129 --> 01:06:57,474
Hello ladies and gentlemen

1292
01:06:58,042 --> 01:06:59,409
Lidon, have a good show

1293
01:07:00,178 --> 01:07:02,850
My best friend Vince once told me

1294
01:07:03,693 --> 01:07:05,082
an actor goes where he's needed

1295
01:07:06,578 --> 01:07:09,363
Well, Vince was needed in the big theater in the sky

1296
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,641
so ... I'll be filling in form as Hamlet

1297
01:07:17,145 --> 01:07:18,714
There's something you all should know

1298
01:07:20,034 --> 01:07:22,530
All the vampires in this play are real

1299
01:07:24,115 --> 01:07:27,066
There's a good chance they're gonna try to feed on you

1300
01:07:27,362 --> 01:07:29,003
or maybe even make you a vampire too

1301
01:07:29,491 --> 01:07:32,803
as soon as the play ends, run for your life

1302
01:07:35,356 --> 01:07:37,740
Another thing that is real

1303
01:07:38,276 --> 01:07:40,557
is the love that Hamlet feels for Ophelia

1304
01:07:41,274 --> 01:07:42,482
Hamlet loves Ophelia

1305
01:07:45,274 --> 01:07:46,685
So if anyone has the Holy Grail

1306
01:07:47,816 --> 01:07:48,976
I could really use it right now

1307
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:53,010
Does anyone in the audience have the Holy Grail?

1308
01:07:55,553 --> 01:07:59,386
Raise your hand and I sure will come to get it from you

1309
01:08:01,834 --> 01:08:04,010
Ok, well. Enjoy the show and remember:

1310
01:08:04,584 --> 01:08:05,569
Run for your life

1311
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:08,884
Death of a pale man

1312
01:08:09,156 --> 01:08:09,948
Dilema, no?

1313
01:08:10,604 --> 01:08:12,301
Question. What do you think about question?

1314
01:08:13,117 --> 01:08:15,388
I don't care, mister Spakesheare

1315
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:19,029
I am not asking you to write The merchant of Venice part two

1316
01:08:19,309 --> 01:08:21,486
I only need you to get a clear message to Hamlet

1317
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:25,238
That those two idiotic vampires he thought might help him ...

1318
01:08:25,822 --> 01:08:27,311
... are dead

1319
01:08:27,847 --> 01:08:32,168
I have to hide this vampire nonsense under the dialog

1320
01:08:32,344 --> 01:08:34,727
because I don't feel like being burned at the stake this month

1321
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,376
and if the play is no good

1322
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,080
then the review will be horrible

1323
01:08:38,344 --> 01:08:39,584
and this Hamlet person, whoever he is

1324
01:08:40,144 --> 01:08:41,697
won't show up!

1325
01:08:42,657 --> 01:08:45,201
Don't! Yell! At me!

1326
01:08:46,338 --> 01:08:49,098
I only ask you to write these words:

1327
01:08:50,761 --> 01:08:53,338
Rosencrantz

1328
01:08:54,706 --> 01:08:57,163
and Guildenstern

1329
01:08:57,931 --> 01:09:00,323
are dead

1330
01:09:04,084 --> 01:09:06,036
You've said Hamlet really loves Ophelia

1331
01:09:06,533 --> 01:09:07,357
What is that mean?

1332
01:09:07,725 --> 01:09:09,676
I am gonna try to find the Grail, cure this curse

1333
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:14,317
Anna, you're on stage! In thirty seconds

1334
01:09:14,558 --> 01:09:15,221
Ok

1335
01:09:15,501 --> 01:09:16,694
But it's not a curse, it's a gift

1336
01:09:17,046 --> 01:09:19,046
And with it you never have to grow up

1337
01:09:19,926 --> 01:09:21,911
I thought you wanna me to grow up

1338
01:09:23,879 --> 01:09:25,176
Women ...

1339
01:09:28,807 --> 01:09:30,007
Rosencrantz

1340
01:09:30,423 --> 01:09:32,568
This meeting likes me much

1341
01:09:32,912 --> 01:09:35,712
We have not met since we were babies

1342
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:40,081
I have come in hopes that I may claim once more my baby love

1343
01:09:42,554 --> 01:09:44,665
Oh, what the hell is this?

1344
01:09:44,929 --> 01:09:46,049
Come on, come on!

1345
01:09:49,914 --> 01:09:50,866
What do you doing?

1346
01:09:51,115 --> 01:09:53,411
This play that's Horatio wrote with Shakespeare

1347
01:09:53,691 --> 01:09:54,931
makes us look like idiots!

1348
01:09:55,147 --> 01:09:58,068
So I found this guy, W. S. Gilbert

1349
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:00,659
to write the play where we are the heroes

1350
01:10:01,035 --> 01:10:02,044
This cool, no?

1351
01:10:02,236 --> 01:10:03,748
No, it's not cool

1352
01:10:03,932 --> 01:10:05,908
Horatio will still think we are alive

1353
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:07,973
We gotta find way out of this mess

1354
01:10:08,189 --> 01:10:09,813
Think, Guildenstern, think

1355
01:10:10,413 --> 01:10:12,798
We could write a newer play and call it

1356
01:10:13,078 --> 01:10:15,463
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead

1357
01:10:15,686 --> 01:10:16,431
or something

1358
01:10:16,599 --> 01:10:17,511
You idiot!

1359
01:10:17,662 --> 01:10:18,886
You imbecile!

1360
01:10:18,998 --> 01:10:19,750
You ...

1361
01:10:19,894 --> 01:10:21,223
... genious!

1362
01:10:21,519 --> 01:10:22,471
I think it will work

1363
01:10:23,015 --> 01:10:26,144
Now, can we get Tom Stoppard to write it?

1364
01:10:39,681 --> 01:10:41,898
I hope you don't mind if I just ...

1365
01:10:47,627 --> 01:10:48,667
At last

1366
01:10:50,059 --> 01:10:51,876
The Grail is mine

1367
01:10:52,612 --> 01:10:54,539
You're under arrest for the murder of Bobby Bianchi

1368
01:10:54,731 --> 01:10:55,619
Ok, I ... I give up

1369
01:10:55,867 --> 01:10:57,340
What, no. Not you kid

1370
01:10:57,972 --> 01:10:59,996
This girl, she ... this crazy ... she bit me

1371
01:11:01,172 --> 01:11:02,357
You know you're off the hook actually

1372
01:11:02,469 --> 01:11:04,637
We've found Bobby's collection of homemade porn

1373
01:11:04,781 --> 01:11:05,518
you got to see this stuff

1374
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:08,230
very ... well, it's not bad actually, very ...

1375
01:11:08,942 --> 01:11:09,670
... organic

1376
01:11:09,782 --> 01:11:12,542
Anyway, she can be seen, right there on the video

1377
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:15,103
sucking his blood, after she stabbed him

1378
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:16,367
really crazy!

1379
01:11:16,487 --> 01:11:17,695
She's obviously unbalanced, but

1380
01:11:17,871 --> 01:11:19,031
we cracked the case

1381
01:11:19,223 --> 01:11:20,560
didn't have to do

1382
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:21,952
Case closed

1383
01:11:33,401 --> 01:11:34,329
What the?

1384
01:11:36,178 --> 01:11:37,018
Whoa

1385
01:11:37,387 --> 01:11:38,658
What, what, did ...

1386
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:40,442
What did you ... What happened?

1387
01:11:45,331 --> 01:11:47,819
I think this is something that we don't file or report on

1388
01:11:48,188 --> 01:11:50,540
I think this is something that we forget about and we just pretend ...

1389
01:11:52,356 --> 01:11:53,972
just pretend this didn't happen if that's ...

1390
01:11:54,964 --> 01:11:55,885
you're OK with that

1391
01:11:56,525 --> 01:11:57,517
I am OK with that

1392
01:11:57,725 --> 01:11:58,501
OK

1393
01:11:59,629 --> 01:12:01,358
You'll clean up the ...

1394
01:12:04,954 --> 01:12:06,619
No, I am just gonna say this, cause this is right time

1395
01:12:07,083 --> 01:12:08,259
I need you to talk to me

1396
01:12:09,219 --> 01:12:12,364
Ok, though I feel like a real woman saying that, but I need your support

1397
01:12:12,916 --> 01:12:15,348
We're police officers and we've got partners for a reason

1398
01:12:16,141 --> 01:12:17,621
Ok, why don't I just ...

1399
01:12:17,909 --> 01:12:18,795
.. buy you a beer?

1400
01:12:21,484 --> 01:12:22,380
I like that

1401
01:12:24,405 --> 01:12:25,660
I like that

1402
01:12:31,262 --> 01:12:32,870
The Grail is mine

1403
01:12:36,772 --> 01:12:37,876
Be there! Be there! Be there! Be there!

1404
01:12:38,028 --> 01:12:39,876
Be there! Be there! Be there! Be there! Be there!

1405
01:12:41,076 --> 01:12:41,692
Be there!

1406
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:45,172
Grrr!

1407
01:12:47,045 --> 01:12:49,013
Of course it would be empty

1408
01:12:49,917 --> 01:12:52,326
Hamlet got here first!

1409
01:12:53,318 --> 01:12:55,975
Oh Hamlet!

1410
01:12:57,175 --> 01:12:59,894
Hamlet!

1411
01:13:10,024 --> 01:13:11,289
Ladies and gentleman

1412
01:13:11,705 --> 01:13:13,177
I knew that Hamlet

1413
01:13:14,041 --> 01:13:15,897
wouldn't miss it for the world

1414
01:13:16,529 --> 01:13:18,225
and I was right

1415
01:13:20,355 --> 01:13:22,050
It's Hamlet, the real Hamlet

1416
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:24,771
My play is turning out awesome

1417
01:13:24,987 --> 01:13:26,763
I suppose

1418
01:13:26,931 --> 01:13:28,371
that this is my entrance

1419
01:13:28,667 --> 01:13:29,748
I ... I don't know

1420
01:13:29,891 --> 01:13:31,356
I've actually never been on stage before

1421
01:13:33,587 --> 01:13:37,356
For every entrance there must be an exit somewhere

1422
01:13:37,612 --> 01:13:38,580
I just got here

1423
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:40,652
Next it from what, Horatio, I am confused

1424
01:13:41,133 --> 01:13:43,877
Oh, from life, perhaps

1425
01:13:45,878 --> 01:13:47,838
Not a day goes by, that I don't dispise you

1426
01:13:47,974 --> 01:13:49,516
for giving up a gift which I gave you

1427
01:13:49,755 --> 01:13:52,444
The only one you should dispise is whomever dresses you!

1428
01:13:52,844 --> 01:13:54,132
My god, Horatio, for reals

1429
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:55,837
Look at yourself, Hamlet

1430
01:13:56,045 --> 01:13:57,956
you've got the vitality and energy of a custard

1431
01:13:58,532 --> 01:14:00,709
Is that what you get from sipping on a Holy Grail?

1432
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:03,269
No! That's what you get when you have a great workout routine

1433
01:14:03,781 --> 01:14:04,894
and you stick to it!

1434
01:14:05,507 --> 01:14:07,411
Oh god. Oh, thanks for showing up

1435
01:14:07,611 --> 01:14:08,659
now that I thought I just got a vampire by myself

1436
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:09,643
I've got to secure the Grail

1437
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:11,419
You had to change outfits to secure the Grail?

1438
01:14:11,723 --> 01:14:12,643
Coming in, mister Liden

1439
01:14:13,043 --> 01:14:16,540
Charlotte, I have visual confirmation on Hamlet

1440
01:14:17,356 --> 01:14:18,612
Retrieve the Grail!

1441
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:19,764
Mister Lidon's with you guys?

1442
01:14:20,613 --> 01:14:22,021
Why doesn't anybody tell me anything?

1443
01:14:22,621 --> 01:14:25,414
I turned you into a vampire!

1444
01:14:26,086 --> 01:14:29,606
Also, by having Shakespeare write that epic tragedy

1445
01:14:30,125 --> 01:14:31,742
I turned you into a god

1446
01:14:33,054 --> 01:14:35,551
The only tragedy here is who in the hell

1447
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:38,199
is Rosencrantz's and Guildenstern's acting couch!

1448
01:14:38,383 --> 01:14:39,840
I mean, right, people, am I right?

1449
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:41,784
They're awful, just terrible!

1450
01:14:42,432 --> 01:14:45,359
Now is this a soliloquy or ... an asidethat I am doing?

1451
01:14:45,552 --> 01:14:47,360
Now you know, why I have to kill him

1452
01:14:48,872 --> 01:14:50,009
Kill him!

1453
01:14:50,368 --> 01:14:52,201
Must ... eat ... Hamlet

1454
01:14:52,817 --> 01:14:54,601
Eat or die, dog

1455
01:15:03,525 --> 01:15:04,820
Bony

1456
01:15:06,684 --> 01:15:09,709
In the Hamlet, you made me look like a lunatic

1457
01:15:11,141 --> 01:15:12,478
in this play ...

1458
01:15:13,838 --> 01:15:14,691
Well, it's actually quite close

1459
01:15:14,883 --> 01:15:15,723
Don't you think? I thought so

1460
01:15:15,891 --> 01:15:16,184
What do you, guys?

1461
01:15:16,383 --> 01:15:16,968
I thought so too

1462
01:15:17,104 --> 01:15:17,696
Me too

1463
01:15:17,856 --> 01:15:18,536
I love you

1464
01:15:18,656 --> 01:15:19,120
Bravo

1465
01:15:19,192 --> 01:15:19,784
Kiss me

1466
01:15:19,904 --> 01:15:20,664
But you're my sister

1467
01:15:21,657 --> 01:15:22,633
Listen to me, Hamlet

1468
01:15:23,521 --> 01:15:26,658
A vampire is the most graceful

1469
01:15:26,946 --> 01:15:29,113
majestic and powerful of creatures

1470
01:15:30,145 --> 01:15:31,585
You would throw that away?

1471
01:15:33,458 --> 01:15:34,626
God, your breath stinks

1472
01:15:34,890 --> 01:15:37,059
The smell of blood was once sweet to you, Hamlet!

1473
01:15:37,443 --> 01:15:38,955
Yes, and now it just tastes like ...

1474
01:15:39,123 --> 01:15:40,307
... blood

1475
01:15:40,627 --> 01:15:41,563
Horatio

1476
01:15:42,036 --> 01:15:43,140
You must choose

1477
01:15:43,452 --> 01:15:44,892
either death

1478
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:46,195
or

1479
01:15:46,804 --> 01:15:48,820
cleanse thyself by sipping

1480
01:15:49,244 --> 01:15:49,948
from the Holy ...

1481
01:15:50,157 --> 01:15:52,461
Grail! Repeat. Visual confirmation on the Grail!

1482
01:15:53,421 --> 01:15:54,485
You must choose

1483
01:15:55,165 --> 01:15:56,310
But choose wisely

1484
01:15:58,446 --> 01:15:59,830
You choose death then

1485
01:16:11,527 --> 01:16:13,288
You battled to the end there, Horatio

1486
01:16:17,761 --> 01:16:18,857
Thank you

1487
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:22,609
Charlotte!

1488
01:16:22,794 --> 01:16:24,137
I have the Grail, repeat, I have the Grail

1489
01:16:28,274 --> 01:16:30,042
Thank you, thank you

1490
01:16:34,179 --> 01:16:37,060
Yes, yes, give it to me

1491
01:16:37,228 --> 01:16:38,348
What do you doing, I need the Grail to cure Anna

1492
01:16:38,483 --> 01:16:39,523
There's no time

1493
01:16:40,019 --> 01:16:41,900
The only way to save Anna now is to kill her

1494
01:16:42,284 --> 01:16:43,876
Kill her? What do you talking about? Kill her?

1495
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:46,325
You just ... you lied to me then. You used me

1496
01:16:48,325 --> 01:16:48,949
Take a bow?

1497
01:16:49,101 --> 01:16:51,590
Yes, just like you used all this leading ladies

1498
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:53,950
Hey, that was absolutely wonderful

1499
01:16:54,142 --> 01:16:55,342
Great special effects

1500
01:16:55,566 --> 01:16:56,037
Thank you very much

1501
01:16:56,165 --> 01:17:00,806
Thank you. Bravo me, yes I know. Thank you, thank you

1502
01:17:01,246 --> 01:17:02,934
You know, I do a little bit of acting myself

1503
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:03,598
Really?

1504
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:04,759
Yes, there is my number

1505
01:17:04,887 --> 01:17:05,751
Thank you

1506
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:07,107
Yes, I know I was excellent. Thank you

1507
01:17:07,762 --> 01:17:08,466
I will give you a call

1508
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:08,762
Yes

1509
01:17:08,851 --> 01:17:09,643
Call me, ok?

1510
01:17:09,795 --> 01:17:10,563
Call me too

1511
01:17:11,819 --> 01:17:15,299
Oh, Julian, that was by far the best production I've seen in my life

1512
01:17:15,563 --> 01:17:18,235
since Missis Doubtfire, perhaps

1513
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:19,932
Thank you so much, prince Hamlet

1514
01:17:20,148 --> 01:17:22,636
Please, call me mister Hamlet, Julian

1515
01:17:23,285 --> 01:17:24,164
Julian ...

1516
01:17:24,805 --> 01:17:27,181
Julian, ha, three hundred years ago

1517
01:17:27,341 --> 01:17:29,702
I slept with a man, accidentaly, named Julian

1518
01:17:31,821 --> 01:17:33,349
Oh, Horatio

1519
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:37,662
How many years I've dreamt of holding your skull in my hands

1520
01:17:37,999 --> 01:17:39,464
Here, give this to your prop guy

1521
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:42,295
I am off to find that hot piece of ass from the second row

1522
01:17:47,432 --> 01:17:48,863
Charlotte?

1523
01:17:51,512 --> 01:17:52,840
Shit

1524
01:18:13,749 --> 01:18:14,614
Hey

1525
01:18:14,997 --> 01:18:15,726
Hi

1526
01:18:16,398 --> 01:18:17,766
I've talked to Charlotte Lawrence

1527
01:18:18,518 --> 01:18:19,830
and she said that the only way

1528
01:18:20,734 --> 01:18:22,951
that I can save your soul is to kill you

1529
01:18:23,671 --> 01:18:25,511
But this is your chance to win me back

1530
01:18:25,984 --> 01:18:27,887
But you're already un ...

1531
01:18:28,111 --> 01:18:29,943
unbelievably attracted to you

1532
01:18:33,168 --> 01:18:34,624
I was gonna say undead

1533
01:18:35,817 --> 01:18:36,978
Exactly

1534
01:18:37,737 --> 01:18:40,994
Which is why we can be together forever

1535
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:46,778
You want that, don't you, Julian?

1536
01:18:50,317 --> 01:18:51,245
Yeah

1537
01:18:52,117 --> 01:18:52,829
And?

1538
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:55,222
And?

1539
01:18:58,167 --> 01:18:59,647
I love you

1540
01:19:10,723 --> 01:19:13,780
Breakfast is Tiffany

1541
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:18,405
Hello

1542
01:19:18,532 --> 01:19:20,061
Did you just wake up?

1543
01:19:20,205 --> 01:19:24,172
Eehm, no, no. I am trying out a new workout

1544
01:19:24,925 --> 01:19:26,221
It's called lying down

1545
01:19:26,349 --> 01:19:28,990
Do you have some young hossie in bed with you?

1546
01:19:29,158 --> 01:19:30,886
Actually, yes

1547
01:19:31,006 --> 01:19:32,662
Aye ... we'll will be there in ten minutes

1548
01:19:33,094 --> 01:19:34,583
We? Who's ... who's we?

1549
01:19:37,559 --> 01:19:39,903
Who is this? I want to suck your balls

1550
01:19:40,551 --> 01:19:41,511
Vince!

1551
01:19:42,119 --> 01:19:43,311
Guess what I am doing right now

1552
01:19:43,455 --> 01:19:46,392
I am looking at review of a certain someone's little play

1553
01:19:46,848 --> 01:19:49,033
and I tell you what, it's so goddamn good

1554
01:19:49,393 --> 01:19:52,169
that I need a promise that I can be in a next one

1555
01:19:52,369 --> 01:19:53,265
That's all there is to it

1556
01:19:53,385 --> 01:19:54,929
Yeah, right, listen Vince

1557
01:19:55,065 --> 01:19:57,090
Crazy how life works

1558
01:19:57,322 --> 01:19:58,602
How ironic is it that I told you

1559
01:19:58,666 --> 01:20:00,690
your exgirlfriend was sucking life out of you

1560
01:20:00,826 --> 01:20:02,394
when as it turns out

1561
01:20:02,546 --> 01:20:04,874
lady's in honest to got vampire

1562
01:20:05,138 --> 01:20:07,811
Dude, I am so happy that you're ok, man

1563
01:20:07,939 --> 01:20:10,596
I would have given anything just to hear your voice one more time

1564
01:20:12,156 --> 01:20:13,116
Hey, man

1565
01:20:14,548 --> 01:20:15,797
Could you put Anna back on the phone?

1566
01:20:16,053 --> 01:20:16,669
Yeah

1567
01:20:18,332 --> 01:20:19,228
Jules

1568
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:21,109
Anna, hey, before I forget to tell you

1569
01:20:21,429 --> 01:20:23,525
I found Charlotte Lawrence again

1570
01:20:23,637 --> 01:20:25,117
I tracked her down and

1571
01:20:25,309 --> 01:20:27,230
so we can sip from the Grail

1572
01:20:27,334 --> 01:20:28,806
and not have our souls

1573
01:20:28,982 --> 01:20:29,871
be

1574
01:20:30,022 --> 01:20:31,423
forever damned or whatever

1575
01:20:31,783 --> 01:20:34,607
But a vampire doesn't need to save her soul when ...

1576
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:36,527
When, when what?

1577
01:20:37,663 --> 01:20:39,127
When she has a soulmate

1578
01:20:39,448 --> 01:20:41,304
Aaah, babe

1579
01:20:41,656 --> 01:20:43,488
You're my soulmate too

1580
01:20:44,376 --> 01:20:45,897
Allright, bye

1581
01:20:48,225 --> 01:20:49,609
Sorry, that was

1582
01:20:49,905 --> 01:20:52,434
that was my girlfriend

1583
01:21:02,106 --> 01:21:07,956
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are undead

1584
