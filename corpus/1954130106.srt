COME ON. HE AIN'T
HURTIN' NOBODY, RIGHT?

271
00:14:26,378 --> 00:14:28,581

275
00:14:40,427 --> 00:14:42,762
HE DON'T

277
00:14:44,463 --> 00:14:46,031
WITH THE GANG NO MORE

278
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:50,436
AND HE DON'T DO
THE WILD THINGS
THAT HE DID BEFORE

279
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:53,672
OOH OOH OOH...

280
00:14:53,672 --> 00:14:55,908
HE USED TO ACT BAD

281
00:14:55,908 --> 00:14:58,010
HE USED TO,
BUT HE QUIT

282
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,213
IT MAKES ME SO SAD

283
00:15:00,213 --> 00:15:03,917
'CAUSE I KNOW THAT
HE DID IT FOR ME

284
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:06,786
AND I CAN SEE...

285
00:15:08,054 --> 00:15:11,658
HIS HEART IS OUT
IN THE STREET...

286
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:39,703
LaMiranda: DON'T LOOK

00:15:47,594 --> 00:15:50,864
THEY CONFISCATED
MY DAMN MAKE-UP BAG.

291
00:15:50,864 --> 00:15:53,866
NOW THAT'S
BRUTALITY.

292
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:56,203
HOW CAN THEY
JUST DO THIS,

293
00:15:56,203 --> 00:15:59,306
LIKE WE DON'T HAVE
A FUCKING CONSTITUTION
OR NOTHING?

294
00:15:59,306 --> 00:16:02,209
WE DON'T. THEY DO.

295
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:04,244
WHO THE FUCK
IS "THEY?"

296
00:16:04,244 --> 00:16:07,647

00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:15,555
AT LEAST WE BELIEVE
IN FUCKING FREEDOM,

300
00:16:15,555 --> 00:16:16,489

301
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:20,894

00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,912
SOMEHOW,
I REALLY BELIEVED

308
00:16:38,912 --> 00:16:42,817

DON'T YOU EVER
GET THIS ANGRY?

315
00:17:05,106 --> 00:17:07,959

00:18:09,904 --> 00:18:13,943
YEAH, MAYBE EVEN
FELT
KINDA COOL  IN SOME FREAKY WAY.

334
00:18:13,943 --> 00:18:17,412
IT IS NOT COOL TO GIVE
THOSE MOTHERFUCKERS

335
00:18:17,412 --> 00:18:21,217
ANY KIND OF EXCUSE
TO PUT THEIR HANDS ON YOU.

336

00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:31,994
IF YOU GIVE THEM CAUSE

00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,483
NATURALLY.

346
00:18:53,483 --> 00:18:55,184
THEN YOU KNOW
IT AIN'T HIP

347
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:56,920
TO CALL A D.Q. "HE."

348
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,357
OH, DID I CALL
HIM "HIM?" OR "HE?"

349
00:19:00,357 --> 00:19:02,659
"SHE?"

350
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:08,331
IS YOUR FAMILY RICH?

351
00:19:08,331 --> 00:19:11,067
WHAT'S MY FAMILY
GOT TO DO WITH ME?

352
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,336
I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

353
00:19:12,336 --> 00:19:14,537
HOW SOMEBODY SO SMART
CAN BE SO STUPID?

354
00:19:14,537 --> 00:19:17,707
WELL, I AIN'T GOT
NO BUDDY IN A STRETCH LIMO.

355
00:19:17,707 --> 00:19:18,508
THAT AIN'T HERS.

356
00:19:18,508 --> 00:19:23,013
BOSTONIA'S GOT
SOME RICH JOHN
WHO TAKES CARE OF HER.

357
00:19:34,892 --> 00:19:36,927
SO, WHICH ARE YOU,
A HE OR A SHE?

358
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:40,380
DEPENDS ON
WHO'S PAYING, BABE.

359
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:49,589
Matty: THAT'S A DRAFT
NOTICE, RIGHT?

360
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:50,274
YEP.

361
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:54,177
UNFORTUNATE FOR THEM,
I HAVE FLAT FEET.

362
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,274
WELCOME TO
TEENY BOP HEAVEN.

363
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:09,626
I'LL MAKE YOU UP
A BED.

364
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:23,074
Matty:
MINE WAS THIS KID,

365
00:20:23,074 --> 00:20:24,175
WHEN I WAS A KID MYSELF.

366
00:20:24,175 --> 00:20:25,809
HE USED TO COME AROUND
WITH HIS DAD TO,

367
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,580
YOU KNOW,
PAINT THE FENCE,
AND STUFF.

368
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,650
I USED TO WATCH HIM
FROM MY WINDOW,

369
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,317
MOWING THE LAWN
WITH HIS SHIRT OFF.

370
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:35,053
DID YOU EVER TELL HIM
HOW YOU FELT?

371
00:20:35,053 --> 00:20:37,956
WELL, HE ALWAYS
USED TO COME OVER
WITH HIS POP.

372
00:20:37,956 --> 00:20:41,058
THEN ONE TIME
HE CAME ALONE,

373
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:43,995
AND WE CAME TOGETHER.

374
00:20:43,995 --> 00:20:47,198
BUT I NEVER
TOLD HIM, NO.

375
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,800
WHO WAS YOUR FIRST?

376
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,235
FIRST LAY?

377
00:20:50,235 --> 00:20:52,003
FIRST LOVE.

378
00:20:52,003 --> 00:20:53,505
I DON'T DO LOVE.

379
00:20:53,505 --> 00:20:55,640
AIN'T NO
PERCENTAGE IN IT.

380
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,744
LaMIRANDA,
WHAT DO YOUR FAMILY
THINK OF YOU?

381
00:21:01,546 --> 00:21:04,949
THEY DRINK
TO FORGET ME.
YOURS?

382
00:21:04,949 --> 00:21:08,520
WELL, WHEN I FIRST
TOLD THEM THAT I WAS
A HOMOSEXUAL--

383
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,954
WAIT. WHEN YOU
WHAT?

384
00:21:09,954 --> 00:21:11,323
THEY DIDN'T
BELIEVE ME.

385
00:21:11,323 --> 00:21:12,356
YOU DID NOT.

386
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:13,492
I DID.

387
00:21:13,492 --> 00:21:15,627
FUCK YOU.
YOU DID NOT!

388
00:21:15,627 --> 00:21:16,161
I WAS 15.

389
00:21:16,161 --> 00:21:19,731
GET OUT OF TOWN.
DIDN'T I SAY YOU WAS RICH?

390
00:21:19,731 --> 00:21:20,599
YOU DID, YEAH.

391
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:21,634
MARY,
PLEASE.

392
00:21:21,634 --> 00:21:25,370
YOU TELL POOR FOLKS,
"MOMMY, I'M A HOMOSEXUAL,"

393
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,940
AND THEY WILL DRAG YOUR ASS
OUT INTO THE DAMN YARD

394
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,744
AND WHIP YOU WITH
A CAR AERIAL, O.K.?

395
00:21:32,444 --> 00:21:34,379
IS THAT WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOU?

396
00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:37,082
WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT ME.

397
00:21:37,082 --> 00:21:38,651
YOU WANT SOME BREAKFAST?

398
00:21:38,651 --> 00:21:40,753
OH, CHRIST.
I SHOULD GET
OUT OF HERE

399
00:21:40,753 --> 00:21:42,021
AND LET YOU
GET SOME SLEEP.

400
00:21:42,021 --> 00:21:45,991
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I HAVE TO GO
TO A MEETING.

401
00:21:45,991 --> 00:21:47,226
A.A.?

402
00:21:47,226 --> 00:21:49,327
WELL, NO.

403
00:21:49,327 --> 00:21:50,896
UM...O.K.

404
00:21:50,896 --> 00:21:55,067
I'M GOING
TO A MEETING OF
THE HOMOPHILE SOCIETY,

405
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:58,738
A GROUP OF
HOMOSEXUAL MEN
WORKING FOR LIBERATION

406
00:21:58,738 --> 00:22:00,306
ACCEPTANCE,
AND INTEGRATION.

407
00:22:00,306 --> 00:22:02,442
YOU TRAVELED
ACROSS AMERICA

408
00:22:02,442 --> 00:22:03,642
TO HAND OUT FLYERS,

409
00:22:03,642 --> 00:22:07,280
THEN YOU TALK TO ME
LIKE I'M DUMB?

410
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,782
LET'S EAT.

411
00:22:12,284 --> 00:22:14,687
LISTEN, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO GO.

412
00:22:14,687 --> 00:22:17,890
YOU CAN STAY HERE
AS LONG AS YOU NEED TO.

413
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:20,961
I KNOW I NEVER
SAID THANK YOU.

414
00:22:20,961 --> 00:22:24,114
I'M LOUSY AT THIS SHIT.

415
00:22:38,344 --> 00:22:40,513
Man: A STEINWAY
IS LIKE A FERRARI.

416
00:22:40,513 --> 00:22:42,115
YOU JUST DON'T LET
ANY SCHMUCK

417
00:22:42,115 --> 00:22:43,717
IN THE DRIVING SEAT.

418
00:22:43,717 --> 00:22:46,185
WELL, YOU SHOULD
HAVE CALLED ME,
ARNIE.

419
00:22:46,185 --> 00:22:47,020
I'M NOT A PRIEST.

420
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,355
YOU CAN TALK TO ME
BEFORE
YOU SCREW UP.

421
00:22:49,355 --> 00:22:50,356
O.K. YEAH.
I'M CALM NOW.

422
00:22:50,356 --> 00:22:53,794
AFTER I HANG UP,
I'M GONNA GO CHANT
OR SOMETHING.

423
00:22:53,794 --> 00:22:54,595
HOW'S THAT?

424
00:22:54,595 --> 00:22:55,962
[HANGS UP
TELEPHONE]

425
00:22:55,962 --> 00:22:56,830
MOVING ON,
WE'RE HERE TODAY

426
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,632
TO CONFIRM DETAILS
WITH THE DAUGHTERS
OF BILITIS

427
00:22:58,632 --> 00:23:00,467
REPRESENTED TODAY
BY AGNES PUGIN

428
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:02,769
AS TO THE PRECISE
NATURE OF OUR MARCH

429
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:05,271
ON INDEPENDENCE HALL
IN PHILADELPHIA,

430
00:23:05,271 --> 00:23:08,309
AGREEMENT ON CODES
OF CONDUCT,
ETCETERA, ETCETERA.

431
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:09,443
WELL, NATURALLY
THE IDEA WOULD BE

432
00:23:09,443 --> 00:23:12,245
TO TAKE A CACHE
OF MORTAR SHELLS
AND LEVEL THE PLACE.

433
00:23:12,245 --> 00:23:16,517
HOWEVER, SINCE WE ARE
A PEACEFUL, POLITICAL
LOBBY GROUP

434
00:23:16,517 --> 00:23:18,051
AND NOT THE BLACK
PANTHERS,

435
00:23:18,051 --> 00:23:19,686
WE'LL FORGO
YOUR MORTAR SHELLS.

436
00:23:19,686 --> 00:23:21,823
THE PANTHERS
NEVER BOMBED
ANYONE, BURT,

437
00:23:21,823 --> 00:23:23,557
THOUGH GOD KNOWS
WHO'D BLAME THEM.

438
00:23:23,557 --> 00:23:25,826
Burt:
MOVING ON, O.K.

439
00:23:25,826 --> 00:23:26,627
DRESS SENSE.

440
00:23:26,627 --> 00:23:30,464
AGNES HAS CONFIRMED
THAT THE DAUGHTERS
OF BILITIS

441
00:23:30,464 --> 00:23:32,766
ARE IN COMPLETE ACCORD
WITH OUR DECISION

442
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:35,202
THAT EVERYONE SHOULD
DRESS AS SENSIBLY

443
00:23:35,202 --> 00:23:37,404
AND AS FORMALLY
AS POSSIBLE.

444
00:23:37,404 --> 00:23:39,239
TUXES, PROM DRESSES...

445
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:40,274
Burt: ETHAN!

446
00:23:40,274 --> 00:23:42,876
SUITS. TIES.

447
00:23:42,876 --> 00:23:43,610
NO PATTERNS, PLEASE.

448
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:47,715
DARK SOCKS, POLISHED SHOES,
NEAT HAIR CUTS,

449
00:23:48,282 --> 00:23:49,416
NO DENIM, NO CHINOS.

450
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:51,786
IF YOU'VE GOT GLASSES,
PLEASE WEAR THEM.

451
00:23:51,786 --> 00:23:52,987
EXCUSE ME. HAIRCUTS?

452
00:23:52,987 --> 00:23:56,357
YOU COULD WEAR A HAT
AND TUCK YOUR HAIR INTO IT,

453
00:23:56,357 --> 00:23:58,825
BUT NEAT HAIR
WOULD BE IDEAL,

454
00:23:58,825 --> 00:24:01,128
AND, I MIGHT ADD,
POSSIBLY QUITE BECOMING.

455
00:24:01,128 --> 00:24:01,962
Agnes: LISTEN, PEOPLE.

456
00:24:01,962 --> 00:24:04,965
THIS DRESS CODE THING,
IT'S REALLY A DRAG,
I KNOW.

457
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:07,102
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST
CIVIL ACTION OF ITS KIND

458
00:24:07,102 --> 00:24:10,270
AND IT'S VITAL THAT
WE MAKE A GOOD
IMPRESSION.

459
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,539
DO YOU SEE?

460
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:15,010
Burt: UH, MOVING ON.

461
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,411
FOR THE LADIES...

462
00:24:16,411 --> 00:24:18,913
THE WOMEN.

463
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,183
SKIRTS. BLOUSES...

464
00:24:29,692 --> 00:24:31,393
Bostonia: VITO!

465
00:24:31,393 --> 00:24:33,695
OH, NEW COLOGNE?

466
00:24:33,695 --> 00:24:35,796
Man: 400...

467
00:24:35,796 --> 00:24:36,464
500--

468
00:24:36,464 --> 00:24:39,034
STOP ME IF
I'M BORING YOU--

469
00:24:39,034 --> 00:24:41,236
700, 750,

470
00:24:41,236 --> 00:24:43,888
A COZY GRAND.

471
00:24:43,938 --> 00:24:45,774
STASH IT.
WE GOT COMPANY.

472
00:24:45,774 --> 00:24:47,142
A LADY
IN THE HOUSE.

473
00:24:47,142 --> 00:24:50,145
DON'T MIND ME, BOYS.

474
00:24:51,746 --> 00:24:52,781
SO WHAT YOU'RE
TELLING ME

475
00:24:52,781 --> 00:24:54,617
IS I PAY YOU
TO BUST ME LESS,

476
00:24:54,617 --> 00:24:55,250
YOU BUST ME MORE.

477
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,185
I PAY YOU FOR WARNINGS,
I GET JACK SHIT.

478
00:24:57,185 --> 00:24:58,753
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO MAKE
MONEY TO PAY YOU,

479
00:24:58,753 --> 00:25:01,189
BUILD A MINT IN MY ASS
AND SHIT DOLLAR BILLS?

480
00:25:01,189 --> 00:25:03,892
Man on phone:
THIS IS A ROUTINE
SHAKE-DOWN.

481
00:25:03,892 --> 00:25:05,193
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

482
00:25:05,193 --> 00:25:08,964
LISTEN, I GOT A COUSIN
WHO RUNS A FAG BAR
IN THE EAST VILLAGE.

483
00:25:08,964 --> 00:25:10,366
THE PRECINCT THERE
IS SO FRIGGIN' ORGANIZED,

484
00:25:10,366 --> 00:25:13,769
THEY GOT A BUST ROTA.
NOW THAT'S
BUSINESS.

485
00:25:13,769 --> 00:25:15,971
LAST NIGHT,
I GOT 2 NELLIES IN STIR

486
00:25:15,971 --> 00:25:18,073
AND AN EMPTY BAR
BY 1:30.

487
00:25:18,073 --> 00:25:19,040
THAT IS NOT BUSINESS.

488
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,842
I'LL TALK TO THE CHIEF.
HOW'S THAT?

489
00:25:20,842 --> 00:25:21,843
YEAH. YOU DO THAT,
AND YOU ASK HIM

490
00:25:21,843 --> 00:25:26,948
ARE WE IN BUSINESS
OR AM I PAYING THE WRONG
PRECINCT, ALL RIGHT?

491
00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:30,053
TAKE A PILL! JEEZ.

492
00:25:38,795 --> 00:25:40,362
WHAT?

493
00:25:40,362 --> 00:25:44,115
WHAT? WHAT KIND
OF FACE IS THAT,
HUH?

494
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:46,535
CRYPTICA?

495
00:25:46,535 --> 00:25:48,370
I'M WARNING YOU,
BOSTONIA.

496
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,173
YOU KEEP YOUR FOOT
OFF MY DICK.

497
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:50,973
I'M ON THE PHONE
CHEWING OUT

498
00:25:50,973 --> 00:25:52,909
THE DEPUTY CHIEF
OF FRIGGIN' POLICE,
FOR CHRISSAKES.

499
00:25:52,909 --> 00:25:55,845
BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS,
YOU GODDAMN LOSER.

500
00:25:55,845 --> 00:26:00,684
IF YOU'RE SO HOT,
WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO
THE FUCKING DEPUTY?

501
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,019
I DO NOT LIKE
TO SEE MY KIDS

502
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:06,088
BLEEDIN' ON THE FLOOR
OF NO PADDYWAGON, O.K.?

503
00:26:06,088 --> 00:26:06,888
COME ON, YOUR KIDS?

504
00:26:06,888 --> 00:26:10,393
THAT DAFFY LITTLE
HEIFER WAS ASKING
TO GET ROUGHED UP.

505
00:26:10,393 --> 00:26:13,196
SHE GETS OFF
ON MAKING WAVES.

506
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,931
YOU KNOW THAT.

507
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:18,234
AH, THE HELL
WITH THEM ALL.

508
00:26:21,304 --> 00:26:24,574
COULDN'T WE JUST
GET A-GODDAMN-WAY

509
00:26:24,574 --> 00:26:25,775
FROM THIS
TIRED TOWN?

510
00:26:25,775 --> 00:26:27,877
SOMEPLACE WHERE
NOBODY KNOWS US?

511
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,247
HONEY, NOBODY
KNOWS US HERE.

512
00:26:30,247 --> 00:26:32,649
COME ON.

513
00:26:34,684 --> 00:26:35,452
ALL RIGHT--YEAH.

514
00:26:35,452 --> 00:26:37,419
AND YOU KEEP IT
THAT WAY.

515
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:38,588
YOU GET OFF ME

516
00:26:38,588 --> 00:26:41,924
BEFORE SOME SUCKER
COMES IN HERE
AND SEES US.

517
00:26:41,924 --> 00:26:45,478
VINNIE, YOU ARE SUCH
A ROMANTIC.

518
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,454
YEAH! CATCH YA!

519
00:26:56,639 --> 00:26:58,991
ANGELO!

520
00:26:59,376 --> 00:27:00,043
BOSS?

521
00:27:00,043 --> 00:27:03,647
ANY OTHER SAD FREAK
WALKS PAST YOU
INTO MY OFFICE

522
00:27:03,647 --> 00:27:05,949
WITHOUT SO MUCH AS EVEN
A KNOCK ON MY DOOR,

523
00:27:05,949 --> 00:27:09,854
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR
FUCKIN' FEATHERS FOR YOU.

524
00:27:09,854 --> 00:27:12,356
ALL RIGHT?

525
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,191
YOU HAVE TO TRY
AND UNDERSTAND BURT.

526
00:27:14,191 --> 00:27:16,160
HE'S NOT THE HIPPEST
GUY ON THE BLOCK

527
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,462
BUT HE HAS A GREAT BRAIN,
GREAT CONNECTIONS,

528
00:27:18,462 --> 00:27:19,564
AND A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY,

529
00:27:19,564 --> 00:27:21,298
ALL OF WHICH
HE CONTRIBUTES
GENEROUSLY...

530
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:22,599
OH! IT'S CASH
THAT COUNTS, RIGHT?

531
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,967
HEY, YOU'RE ONLY HEARING
WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR.

532
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:26,737
BURT'S GIVEN A GREAT
DEAL OF HIMSELF
TO FURTHERING THIS CAUSE.

533
00:27:26,737 --> 00:27:29,073
HE'S JUST KIND OF
OUT OF ANOTHER TIME.

534
00:27:29,073 --> 00:27:31,742
IT'S JUST THAT
I DIDN'T COME
ACROSS AMERICA

535
00:27:31,742 --> 00:27:33,611
TO HAND OUT FLYERS
IN A SUIT, YOU KNOW?

536
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:35,613
WHAT
DID
YOU COME HERE FOR?

537
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:39,183
I KNOW. I CAME HERE
AS A FRESHMAN AT COLUMBIA,

538
00:27:39,183 --> 00:27:40,718
AND I WAS GONNA KICK
THE WORLD'S ASS.

539
00:27:40,718 --> 00:27:43,554
WHEN YOU'RE 19,
FINDING SOMETHING
TO FIGHT FOR

540
00:27:43,554 --> 00:27:44,589
CAN BE KIND OF A THRILL.

541
00:27:44,589 --> 00:27:47,125
I'M GLAD SOMEBODY'S
GETTING A KICK
OUT OF IT.

542
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,126
I'M NOT 19 ANYMORE.

543
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:50,928
I SPENT ALMOST 10 YEARS
TEACHING BROOKLYN KIDS

544
00:27:50,928 --> 00:27:52,129
ABOUT WALT WHITMAN
AND SHAKESPEARE,

545
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:54,633
NEVER MENTIONING
WHAT REALLY
MATTERED TO ME

546
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:55,967
OR I'M OUT OF THERE.

547
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:57,368
I'VE SEEN THEM
COME AND GO,

548
00:27:57,368 --> 00:27:59,404
AND THE ONES WHO SURVIVE
ARE THE ONES

549
00:27:59,404 --> 00:28:01,205
WHO LEARN HOW
TO WORK IT FROM INSIDE.

550
00:28:01,205 --> 00:28:03,909
SEE, I'M NOT IN THIS
FOR THE FIGHT ANYMORE.

551
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:06,861
I'M IN THIS TO WIN.

552
00:28:08,246 --> 00:28:10,081
LISTEN, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING RIGHT NOW?

553
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:11,082
OH, NOTHING.

554
00:28:11,082 --> 00:28:13,885
I'M GOTTA MEET
SOMEBODY LATER,
MUCH LATER,

555
00:28:13,885 --> 00:28:15,686
BUT I'M FREE
RIGHT NOW FOR NOW.

556
00:28:15,686 --> 00:28:19,591
YOU WANNA WALK?
I'LL SHOW YOU NEW YORK.

557
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:24,457
SO HOW LATE IS HE
NOW?

558
00:29:24,457 --> 00:29:27,159
ABOUT 30 SECONDS
LATER THAN THE LAST
TIME YOU ASKED ME.

559
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:28,995
DON'T PISS ME OFF,
GIRLFRIEND.

560
00:29:28,995 --> 00:29:31,531
OOH, BOY!
THIS STUD MUST
BE SOMETHING

561
00:29:31,531 --> 00:29:33,200
FOR MISS
LaMIRANDA THING

562
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,768
TO SIT WAITING
ON HER HIND LEGS
THIS WAY.

563
00:29:35,768 --> 00:29:38,504
THERE MUST BE
SOME SERIOUS
DISH HERE.

564
00:29:38,504 --> 00:29:40,707
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M SAYING?

565
00:29:40,707 --> 00:29:42,041
PARDONNEZ MOI?

566
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:43,108
DOES HE KISS?

567
00:29:43,108 --> 00:29:45,845
IS HE HUNG LIKE
AN OX OR A CHIPMUNK?

568
00:29:45,845 --> 00:29:49,216
IS HE A BULL-DAGGER
IN MAN DRAG? COME ON!

569
00:29:49,216 --> 00:29:51,417
I THINK MAYBE
HE'S A COMMUNIST.

570
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:52,384
MMM! AND SO CUTE?

571
00:29:52,384 --> 00:29:54,454
I DON'T KNOW.
HE'S KINDA FREAKY,
YOU KNOW?

572
00:29:54,454 --> 00:29:57,423
HE THINK MAYBE
HE DROPPED OUT OF
COLLEGE OR SOMETHING

573
00:29:57,423 --> 00:29:59,359
TO SLUM IT
WITH THE STREET TRASH.

574
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:02,162
BUT WE NEVER REALLY
DID NOTHING YET.

575
00:30:02,162 --> 00:30:05,015
GOD, YOU ARE SAD!

576
00:30:05,098 --> 00:30:07,267
WELL, WE ALMOST
KISSED THIS MORNING.

577
00:30:07,267 --> 00:30:10,203
AND HE WAS, YOU KNOW,
SCARY, BUT NICE.

578
00:30:10,203 --> 00:30:13,373
AND LAST NIGHT
WE JUST TALKED
ALL NIGHT,

579
00:30:13,373 --> 00:30:15,675
AND HE HELPED ME
COOK BREAKFAST.

580
00:30:15,675 --> 00:30:17,444
ALL NIGHT? NO SEX?

581
00:30:17,444 --> 00:30:20,280

00:45:18,292 --> 00:45:20,727
GONNA WALK
RIGHT UP TO HIM

875
00:45:20,727 --> 00:45:23,430
GIVE HIM
A GREAT BIG KISS, MUAH!

876
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:26,233
AND TELL HIM THAT I LOVE HIM,
TELL HIM THAT I CARE

877
00:45:26,233 --> 00:45:29,436
TELL HIM THAT I'LL
ALWAYS BE THERE

878
00:45:29,436 --> 00:45:30,604
IS HE
A GOOD DANCER?

879
00:45:30,604 --> 00:45:33,340
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
IS HE A GOOD DANCER?

880
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,642
WELL, HOW
DOES HE DANCE?

881
00:45:35,642 --> 00:45:36,877
CLOSE

882
00:45:36,877 --> 00:45:39,113
VERY, VERY CLOSE

883
00:45:39,113 --> 00:45:42,016
OOH, OOH, OOH, OOH

884
00:45:44,184 --> 00:45:46,621
LOOK AT MISS PIGLET
IN HER MUD BATH.

885
00:45:46,621 --> 00:45:49,223
WHEN WAS THE
LAST TIME YOU TOOK
A BATH, GIRL?

886
00:45:49,223 --> 00:45:51,325
HEY, I DON'T HAVE TO
ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

887
00:45:51,325 --> 00:45:53,294
OH, GIRL, BE STILL
AND STOP SWITCHING

888
00:45:53,294 --> 00:45:56,998
BEFORE I MISS THE LAST
FEW STRANDS OF HAIRS
YOU STILL GOT UP HERE.

889
00:45:56,998 --> 00:45:59,066
WELL, AT LEAST
SOME OF IT IS STILL
MY OWN DAMN HAIR.

890
00:45:59,066 --> 00:46:01,002
[STRUMMING GUITAR]
UH-OH. IS THIS
FUZZY FELT HERE

891
00:46:01,002 --> 00:46:03,938
SOME SOURCE OF PRIDE
TO THIS SICK, SEEDY,
MESSY QUEEN

892
00:46:03,938 --> 00:46:05,572
I'M DEALING WITH
OVER HERE?

893
00:46:05,572 --> 00:46:07,008
WOULD YOU SHUT
THE HELL UP?

894
00:46:07,008 --> 00:46:10,778
MY MAN IS TRYING TO
CALL UPON HIS MUSE,
DAMN IT!

895
00:46:10,778 --> 00:46:12,547
[GASPS]

896
00:46:12,547 --> 00:46:14,381
[SINGING]

897
00:46:14,381 --> 00:46:15,749
MMM!

898
00:46:15,749 --> 00:46:19,053
WHEN WE GROWS
WITH THE BLUE

899
00:46:20,187 --> 00:46:23,759
MINE EYES HAVE SEEN
THE COMIN' OF

900
00:46:23,759 --> 00:46:26,561
MMM-MM!
THE NEGROES AND THE JEWS

901
00:46:26,561 --> 00:46:28,930
I HAVE SEEN
THE COUNTRIES TRAMPLED

902
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:32,167
DID HE JUST SAY NEGROES?
WHERE THE LAWS OF MAN
ABUSE

903
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:34,902
UH-HUH!
BUT YOU CRUSH

905
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:37,372
GIRL,
COME GET HIM.

906
00:46:37,372 --> 00:46:40,776
LaMIRANDA,
PLEASE HAVE HIM STOP.

907
00:46:40,776 --> 00:46:41,609

YES, PLEASE.

908
00:46:41,609 --> 00:46:43,345
...GO MARCHIN' ON--

909
00:46:43,345 --> 00:46:44,312
NOW?

910
00:46:44,312 --> 00:46:45,646
UH, BABY?

911
00:46:45,646 --> 00:46:47,049
IT SUCKS, DON'T IT?

912
00:46:47,049 --> 00:46:47,816
Moxie: MM-HMM!
SUCKS? TCH!

913
00:46:47,816 --> 00:46:51,319
CHICKIE, HOW COULD
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU SUCK?

914
00:46:51,319 --> 00:46:52,687
Moxie: WELL...

915
00:46:52,687 --> 00:46:54,823
IT JUST SOUNDS
A LITTLE...

916
00:46:54,823 --> 00:46:55,858
LITERARY.

917
00:46:55,858 --> 00:46:56,524
LITERAL.

918
00:46:56,524 --> 00:46:57,692
LITERAL...ISTIC.
YOU DIG?

919
00:46:57,692 --> 00:46:59,327
YOU THINK IT'S
TOO LITERAL?

920
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,262
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I SAID, AIN'T IT?

921
00:47:01,262 --> 00:47:03,098
I DON'T KNOW.
WHATEVER.
IT'S TOO...

922
00:47:03,098 --> 00:47:05,166
IT'S TOO GOD DAMNED
PREACHY, YOU KNOW?

923
00:47:05,166 --> 00:47:06,601
IT'S A LITTLE
WHITE-BREAD, ALSO.

924
00:47:06,601 --> 00:47:08,669
WHITE BOY.
YEAH!
WHITE BOY.

925
00:47:08,669 --> 00:47:10,206
BUT IT'S FABULOUS
OTHERWISE.

00:47:10,206 --> 00:47:11,673
PERMISSION
TO PUKE, MA'AM.

927
00:47:11,673 --> 00:47:12,340
SHUT UP, BITCH.

928
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,175
I AIN'T THE ONE
THAT'S COMING ON

929
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,378
LIKE BOBBY DYLAN
IN A COMA, NOW AM I?

930
00:47:16,378 --> 00:47:17,646
THE FEMALES BY NATURE

931
00:47:17,646 --> 00:47:20,916
DO NOT HAVE THE SAME
SEXUAL DRIVES AS MALES.

932
00:47:20,916 --> 00:47:23,318
AND THEREFORE,
MEN WHO SUFFER

933
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:25,921
FROM AN ABNORMAL
SEXUAL COMPULSION

934
00:47:25,921 --> 00:47:28,256
ARE FORCED TO TURN
TO OTHERS

935
00:47:28,256 --> 00:47:30,325
WHO HAVE THE SAME
UNCONTROLLABLE NEED

936
00:47:30,325 --> 00:47:33,096
TO SATISFY THEIR
UNNATURAL DESIRES.

937
00:47:33,096 --> 00:47:35,697
THEY TURN TO OTHER MEN,
OTHER HOMOSEXUALS.

938
00:47:35,697 --> 00:47:40,136
AND NOW THIS, OF COURSE,
FINDS THE SEED FALLING
ON BARREN SOIL,

939
00:47:40,136 --> 00:47:43,839
WHICH LEADS TO
MORE FRUSTRATION AND
INCREASING COMPULSION

940
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,474
LIKE THE DOPE ADDICT.

941
00:47:45,474 --> 00:47:47,143
UNLIKE DRUG ADDICTION,
HOWEVER,

942
00:47:47,143 --> 00:47:50,146
NONE OF THIS CAN BE
BLAMED ON THE INDIVIDUAL.

943
00:47:50,146 --> 00:47:54,199
HOMOSEXUALITY IS AN ILLNESS,
A CONDITION--

944
00:47:55,652 --> 00:47:57,386
UH...SPARKED BY THE

945
00:47:57,386 --> 00:47:59,455
CHEMICAL IMBALANCE
IN THE BRAIN.

946
00:47:59,455 --> 00:48:01,156
ON THE FACE OF
THIS EVIDENCE,

947
00:48:01,156 --> 00:48:03,059
FAULTY FAMILY
CONFIGURATIONS

948
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:06,529
ARE NOT GROUNDS FOR
DENYING ANY AMERICAN CITIZEN

949
00:48:06,529 --> 00:48:09,999
THEIR BASIC
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.

950
00:48:09,999 --> 00:48:10,867
I...

951
00:48:10,867 --> 00:48:11,968
I THANK YOU.

952
00:48:11,968 --> 00:48:14,470
THANK YOU.

953
00:48:16,205 --> 00:48:18,908
ANY QUESTIONS?

954
00:48:19,509 --> 00:48:20,977
YOU'RE NOT TALKING, MATTY.

955
00:48:20,977 --> 00:48:22,145
OH, I WAS JUST
WONDERING.

956
00:48:22,145 --> 00:48:25,149
WHY ARE WE HEADING
INTO GREENWICH
VILLAGE

957
00:48:25,149 --> 00:48:26,015
TO MEET THE PRESS

958
00:48:26,015 --> 00:48:28,985
WHEN WE SHOULD BE
CHECKING INTO
THE PSYCHO WARD

959
00:48:28,985 --> 00:48:31,921
TO HAVE OUR EXCESS
OF SPERM DEPOSITS
SIPHONED OFF?

960
00:48:31,921 --> 00:48:33,123
IT'S JUST AN OPINION,
MATTY.

961
00:48:33,123 --> 00:48:35,592
HITLER AND THE BOYS
HAD AN OPINION,
BURT.

962
00:48:35,592 --> 00:48:38,728
NOW WAIT. THE FACT IS
THAT THE IDEA OF SICKNESS

963
00:48:38,728 --> 00:48:40,864
IS A CONCEPT
THAT AMERICA CAN DEAL WITH.

964
00:48:40,864 --> 00:48:42,765
AND AT THIS STAGE,
QUITE FRANKLY,

965
00:48:42,765 --> 00:48:45,234
SYMPATHY WOULD BE
A HUGE STEP FOR US.

966
00:48:45,234 --> 00:48:45,902
YOU MEAN PITY.

967
00:48:45,902 --> 00:48:49,739
ANY WORD THAT MEANS
NOT HATE IS A STEP,
DON'T YOU THINK?

968
00:48:49,739 --> 00:48:51,541
I CAN'T THINK.

969
00:48:51,541 --> 00:48:53,376
COULDN'T YOU TRY THINKING?

970
00:48:53,376 --> 00:48:55,629
UH...

971
00:48:58,815 --> 00:49:00,684
YOU DONE?

972
00:49:00,684 --> 00:49:02,837
NO.

973
00:49:03,253 --> 00:49:04,221
NOW I'M DONE.

974
00:49:04,221 --> 00:49:07,057
O.K. WE CAN FIGHT
ALL WE WANT BETWEEN US,

975
00:49:07,057 --> 00:49:09,927
BUT THIS MEETING IS WITH
OUR ONLY ALLY IN THE PRESS.

976
00:49:09,927 --> 00:49:13,130
WE NEED TO PRESENT
A UNITED FRONT.
ISN'T THAT REASONABLE?

977
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:17,284
BUT NATURALLY, BURT.
WE'RE ALWAYS
REASONABLE.

978
00:49:19,903 --> 00:49:21,872
YOU'LL TELL THEM
I'M HERE RIGHT?

979
00:49:21,872 --> 00:49:23,941
I'M GOING TO TELL
EVERYONE. RELAX.

980
00:49:23,941 --> 00:49:25,909
WE'LL HAVE
A COUPLE OF DRINKS?

981
00:49:25,909 --> 00:49:28,178
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A LOT OF DRINKS.

982
00:49:28,178 --> 00:49:29,714
HOWEVER, I CAN'T...

984
00:49:30,715 --> 00:49:32,216

PLEASE CALL ME

988
00:49:35,486 --> 00:49:38,623

OH, RAOUL.
LISTEN, I BROUGHT ALONG
A PHOTOGRAPHER WITH ME.

993
00:49:44,662 --> 00:49:49,017
WOULD YOU GUYS
BE WILLING TO POSE
FOR SOME SHOTS?

994
00:49:51,102 --> 00:49:53,871
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM
FOR US.

995
00:49:53,871 --> 00:49:54,772
RIGHT?

996
00:49:54,772 --> 00:49:56,107
OH. GOOD. GREAT.

997
00:49:56,107 --> 00:50:00,511
I'M GOING TO START
THE FIRST SHOT
RIGHT OVER HERE.

998
00:50:01,045 --> 00:50:02,847
STAY RIGHT THERE.

SMILING A LITTLE?

1002
00:50:10,789 --> 00:50:11,256
GOOD.

1003
00:50:11,256 --> 00:50:13,925
YEAH. KEEP THAT HAND
DOWN. THANKS.

1004
00:50:13,925 --> 00:50:16,094
A LITTLE TO
THE LEFT, PLEASE.

1005
00:50:16,094 --> 00:50:17,962
ALL RIGHT.
I LIKE IT.

1006
00:50:17,962 --> 00:50:18,830

A LITTLE STYLE.

1009
00:50:22,767 --> 00:50:25,421
THAT'S GREAT.

1010
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,676
SO THE PLAN HERE
IS WHAT?

1011
00:50:31,676 --> 00:50:33,812
UH, WE...SIT DOWN...

1012
00:50:33,812 --> 00:50:36,380
WE ANNOUNCE OURSELVES
AS HOMOSEXUALS,

1013
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:37,683
THEN WE ORDER DRINKS...

1014
00:50:37,683 --> 00:50:41,253
AT WHICH POINT
THEY ARE COMPELLED
TO REFUSE US.

1015
00:50:41,253 --> 00:50:42,221
AS DICTATED BY?

1016
00:50:42,221 --> 00:50:44,989
BY OUR FASCIST
AND UNAMERICAN
STATE LAWS.

1017
00:50:44,989 --> 00:50:47,692
THEN WE FLAMETHROW
THE PLACE.

1018
00:50:47,692 --> 00:50:49,428
HE'S A REAL KIDDER.

1019
00:50:49,428 --> 00:50:50,162
MATTY.

1020
00:50:50,162 --> 00:50:53,565
YOU KNOW
HOW IT IS, BURT.
CHEMICAL IMBALANCE.

1021
00:50:53,565 --> 00:50:55,968
WHAT CAN I GET YOU
GUYS?

1022
00:50:55,968 --> 00:50:57,736
WE ARE A GROUP
OF HOMOSEXUALS,

1023
00:50:57,736 --> 00:51:01,306
AND WE WOULD LIKE
TO ORDER A BEER
EACH.

1024
00:51:01,306 --> 00:51:02,708
IT'S TEQUILA
FOR ME, BURT.

1025
00:51:02,708 --> 00:51:04,376
O.K., SO THAT'S, UH,

HOMOSEXUALS.

1028
00:51:08,447 --> 00:51:09,414
YES.

1029
00:51:09,414 --> 00:51:11,117
RIGHT.

1030
00:51:11,117 --> 00:51:12,184
THANK YOU.

1031
00:51:12,184 --> 00:51:12,918

TEQUILA, PLEASE.
LIME. A LITTLE SALT.

1034
00:51:19,024 --> 00:51:21,626
O.K. THANKS.

1035
00:51:22,694 --> 00:51:26,031
THAT'S HOW MANY BEERS
AND HOW MANY HOMOSEXUALS?

1036
00:51:26,031 --> 00:51:30,285
WELL, IT'S 3 ACTUAL
AND 2 HONORARY
HOMOSEXUALS,

1037
00:51:30,402 --> 00:51:32,071
INCLUDING A QUITE
YOUNG HOMOSEXUAL,

1038
00:51:32,071 --> 00:51:35,174
AND WE'RE DRINKING
4 BEERS AND A TEQUILA.

1039
00:51:35,174 --> 00:51:36,609

00:51:36,609 --> 00:51:38,878
MAKE THAT 2 TEQUILAS.

1041

ACTUAL TEQUILA
OR HONORARY TEQUILA?

1042
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:45,084
MIGHT WE SEE
YOUR MANAGER?

1043
00:51:45,084 --> 00:51:46,252
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

1044
00:51:46,252 --> 00:51:47,653
[LAUGHS] HOMOSEXUALS?

1045
00:51:47,653 --> 00:51:49,455
HOW DO I KNOW
IF YOU'RE HOMOSEXUALS?

1046
00:51:49,455 --> 00:51:51,191
SEEM PRETTY
NORMAL TO ME.

1047
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,526
KINDA SUPERNORMAL,
AS A MATTER OF FACT.

1048
00:51:53,526 --> 00:51:55,227
THESE DAYS,
WHO CAN TELL?

1049
00:51:55,227 --> 00:51:58,631
EVEN I COULD BE A HOMO,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES.

1050
00:51:58,631 --> 00:52:00,433
AND FAG MONEY
IS STILL MONEY.

1051
00:52:00,433 --> 00:52:02,334
GET THESE BOYS
A DRINK.

1052
00:52:02,334 --> 00:52:03,871
ON THE HOUSE, FELLAS.

1053
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:04,805
DRINKS ARE ON ME,
FELLAS.

1054
00:52:04,805 --> 00:52:08,675
WELL, SEE IF YOU CAN TELL
IF THEY'RE HOMO DRINKS
OR HETERO DRINKS.

1055
00:52:08,675 --> 00:52:10,576
I CAN'T DO THIS
MUCH LONGER.

1056
00:52:10,576 --> 00:52:12,212
I JUST DON'T HAVE
THE CONSTITUTION.

1057
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,814
IN FRONT OF THE PRESS,
SUDDENLY EVERYBODY'S
A LIBERAL.

1058
00:52:14,814 --> 00:52:17,049
MAYBE YOU GUYS
ARE BEHIND THE TIMES.

1059
00:52:17,049 --> 00:52:18,351
NO. IT IS
A STATE LAW.

1060
00:52:18,351 --> 00:52:20,187
THERE'S ONE PLACE
WE CAN GUARANTEE

1061
00:52:20,187 --> 00:52:22,923
SELF-CONFESSED
FAGGOTS WILL NOT
BE SERVED.

1062
00:52:22,923 --> 00:52:25,558
A FAGGOT BAR.
FOLLOW ME, GUYS.

1063
00:52:25,558 --> 00:52:26,794
FAGGOT BAR?

1064
00:52:26,794 --> 00:52:28,328
I LIKE THAT.

1065
00:52:28,328 --> 00:52:30,831
HEY, VITO.

1066
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,432
WHAT'S UP?

1067
00:52:32,432 --> 00:52:33,266
HI.

1068
00:52:33,266 --> 00:52:34,167
GOOD EVENING.

1069
00:52:34,167 --> 00:52:35,602
HI. WE'RE A COUPLE.

1070
00:52:35,602 --> 00:52:38,554
[GIGGLING]
HI, VITO!

1071
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:42,676
MATTY, YOU LITTLE
SHOW-STOPPER.

1072
00:52:42,676 --> 00:52:44,044
MY PRETTY PATOOTIE.

1073
00:52:44,044 --> 00:52:45,713
HOW'S THE CLASSY
CHASSIS?

1074
00:52:45,713 --> 00:52:48,781
IN NEED OF
A LITTLE SERVICING,
TENDERBOX.

1075
00:52:48,781 --> 00:52:50,151
OH, YOU TEASE.

1076
00:52:50,151 --> 00:52:51,184
WHAT LANGUAGE IS THIS?

1077
00:52:51,184 --> 00:52:53,887
I FEEL LIKE A WETBACK
IN MY OWN NEIGHBORHOOD.

1078
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,288
YOU ARE.

1079
00:52:55,288 --> 00:52:56,289
BURT.

1080
00:52:56,289 --> 00:52:57,291
BURT?

1081
00:52:57,291 --> 00:52:58,326
YEAH.

1082
00:52:58,326 --> 00:52:59,327
OH.

1083
00:52:59,327 --> 00:53:01,462
HI.

1084
00:53:01,462 --> 00:53:06,133
WE'RE A HOMOSEXUAL GROUP
OF SELF-CONFESSED
HOMOSEXUALS--

1085
00:53:06,133 --> 00:53:07,000
HEY, VITO!

1086
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,069
GOD DAMN
TROUBLE-MAKERS.

1087
00:53:09,069 --> 00:53:10,437
VITO, GIRL,
WHERE ARE YOU?

1088
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,073
HEY, PRINCESS,
BE COOL.

1089
00:53:12,073 --> 00:53:13,474
YOU JUST HAVE TO
REFUSE.

1090
00:53:13,474 --> 00:53:16,610
I DONE THAT, SWEETIE.
NOW GET THESE LOSERS

1091
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:17,911

THROW THESE FOOLS

1093
00:53:20,014 --> 00:53:21,916
HEY, CHUMP,

1094
00:53:21,916 --> 00:53:22,816
HEY!

1095
00:53:22,816 --> 00:53:24,385
HEY, PUNK!

1096
00:53:24,385 --> 00:53:25,386

VITO!

1098
00:53:26,755 --> 00:53:29,457
COOL IT, BABY.

1099
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,562
NOW ISN'T THAT
NICER, PEOPLE?

1100
00:53:34,562 --> 00:53:37,614
YOU KIDS
WANT A DRINK?

1101
00:53:37,699 --> 00:53:39,833
ACTUALLY, UH...NO.

1102
00:53:39,833 --> 00:53:40,534
EXCUSE ME?

1103
00:53:40,534 --> 00:53:42,504
WE WANNA BE
REFUSED, BO.

1104
00:53:42,504 --> 00:53:44,539
IT'S A POLITICAL
STATEMENT.

1105
00:53:44,539 --> 00:53:45,907
WATCH YOUR
GODDAMN MOUTH!

1106
00:53:45,907 --> 00:53:48,809
NOW YOU KNOW VINNIE
DON'T ALLOW THAT SHIT
IN HERE, BO.

1107
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:51,913
CHILD, WHAT DID I
TELL YOU ABOUT MESSING
WITH THAT STUFF?

1108
00:53:51,913 --> 00:53:54,515
WE JUST WANT
AN OFFICIAL REFUSAL,

1109
00:53:54,515 --> 00:53:56,050
THEN WE'LL BE DONE,
O.K.?

1110
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:57,786
FOR CRYING
OUT LOUD.

1111
00:53:57,786 --> 00:53:58,220
PRINCESS.

1112
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:00,789
I DONE REFUSED
TWICE ALREADY,
GODDAMN IT.

1113
00:54:00,789 --> 00:54:02,223
REFUSE AGAIN.

1114
00:54:02,223 --> 00:54:03,457
OFFICIAL-LIKE.

1115
00:54:03,457 --> 00:54:04,526
THE STATE LIQUOR
AUTHORITY

1116
00:54:04,526 --> 00:54:07,529
PROHIBITS THE
SELLING OF LIQUOR
TO HOMOSEXUALS.

1117
00:54:07,529 --> 00:54:11,165
THEREFORE, I REGRET
WE MUST REFUSE
TO SERVE YOU.

1118
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:14,019
HAPPY, EVERYBODY?

1119
00:54:17,138 --> 00:54:19,340
YOU OWE ME A DANCE.

1120
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,042
OH, I...

1121
00:54:20,042 --> 00:54:22,011
IT'S ALLOWED HERE,
SWEETNESS.

1122
00:54:22,011 --> 00:54:24,112
Ernestine: IT'S ALLOWED
HERE, SWEETNESS!

1123
00:54:24,112 --> 00:54:25,314
I WOULD BE DELIGHTED.

1124
00:54:25,314 --> 00:54:29,018
DON'T STEP ON
HER BLUE SUEDE SHOES.

1125
00:54:29,084 --> 00:54:30,920
WELL, I THINK WE GOT
OUR STORY.

1126
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,373
LET'S GET THE HELL
OUTTA HERE.

1127
00:54:34,523 --> 00:54:38,160
IS THIS A
PRIVATE REVOLUTION,
OR CAN ANYONE JOIN?

1128
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,294
HI, BABY.

1129
00:54:39,294 --> 00:54:42,665
SO, HOW'S LIFE
ON THE FRONT LINE?

1130
00:54:42,665 --> 00:54:45,367
AW...YOU KNOW.

1131
00:54:45,367 --> 00:54:46,468
HA HA HA.

1132
00:54:46,468 --> 00:54:49,404
OH, LaMIRANDA,
THIS IS ETHAN.

1133
00:54:49,404 --> 00:54:51,239
LaMIRANDA.

1134
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:53,241
I NEVER KNEW
RADICALS CAME

1135
00:54:53,241 --> 00:54:55,010
WITH SUCH PRETTY
PACKAGES.

1136
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:57,447
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO CHECK OUT

1137
00:54:57,447 --> 00:54:59,348
ONE OF THESE
MEETINGS MYSELF.

1138
00:54:59,348 --> 00:55:00,716
YOU KNOW,
YOU REALLY SHOULD.

1139
00:55:00,716 --> 00:55:03,318
WE SHOULD TAKE YOU
DOWN TO PHILLY
WITH US.

1140
00:55:03,318 --> 00:55:05,388
THAT WOULD WAKE UP
MIDDLE AMERICA.

1141
00:55:05,388 --> 00:55:07,190
YOU GUYS GOING
TO PHILADELPHIA?

1142
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:10,225
ON A SIGHT-SEEING
TOUR TO THE LIBERTY
BELL, OR WHAT?

1143
00:55:10,225 --> 00:55:12,896
WE GOT A BIG DEAL
CIVIL RIGHTS MARCH
HAPPENING

1144
00:55:12,896 --> 00:55:14,430
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

1145
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:15,531
IT'S KIND OF A DRAG.

1146
00:55:15,531 --> 00:55:18,701
THEY WANT US ALL TO
WEAR DRESSES AND SUITS

1147
00:55:18,701 --> 00:55:22,472
LIKE JOHN AND JACKIE
KENNEDY-STYLE SQUARES.

1148
00:55:22,472 --> 00:55:25,475
WELL, I KNOW WHO
I'M GOIN' AS.

1149
00:55:25,475 --> 00:55:27,275
SOUNDS LIKE
MY KINDA DRAG.

1150
00:55:27,275 --> 00:55:30,713
SERIOUSLY,
I MAYBE MIGHT BE
INTERESTED

1151
00:55:30,713 --> 00:55:32,582
IN COMING ALONG.

1152
00:55:32,582 --> 00:55:35,018
MATTY'S BEEN
TELLING ME WHAT
YOU GUYS

1153
00:55:35,018 --> 00:55:35,952
ARE TRYING TO DO,

1154
00:55:35,952 --> 00:55:39,455
AND IT ALL SOUNDS
KIND OF UP ASSWARDS
TO ME,

1155
00:55:39,455 --> 00:55:43,159
BUT AT LEAST YOU'RE
GETTING SOMETHING
TOGETHER, RIGHT?

1156
00:55:43,159 --> 00:55:45,962
MATT, YOU BEEN DOING
A LITTLE OUTREACH
WORK?

1157
00:55:45,962 --> 00:55:49,031
OH, LaMIRANDA AND I
ARE ROOMMATES, ETHAN.

1158
00:55:49,031 --> 00:55:51,267
OH, DON'T OVERSELL
IT ON MY ACCOUNT,

1159
00:55:51,267 --> 00:55:52,268
MASSA MATTY DEAN,
SUH!

1160
00:55:52,268 --> 00:55:55,638
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TELL
LOVER BOY HERE

1161
00:55:55,638 --> 00:55:58,992
THAT I'M YOUR
FUCKING MAID?!

1162
00:56:01,244 --> 00:56:02,078
LaMIRANDA. BABY.

1163
00:56:02,078 --> 00:56:04,180
I'M TOO DRUNK TO RUN.

1164
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:06,049
WOULD YOU STOP?

1165
00:56:06,049 --> 00:56:07,984
WHEN YOU SEE THIS FACE,

1166
00:56:07,984 --> 00:56:10,520
YOU WILL SEE NO TEARS
HERE, O.K.?

1167
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,087
NO TEARS.

1168
00:56:11,087 --> 00:56:14,158
I DIDN'T TELL YOU
ABOUT THE PICKET
IN PHILADELPHIA

1169
00:56:14,158 --> 00:56:17,060
'CAUSE THEY GOT THESE
DUMB OLD DRESS CODES,

1170
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,995
AND I KNEW THAT WOULD
NEVER GO WITH YOU.

1171
00:56:18,995 --> 00:56:24,100
AND YOU NEVER TOLD THEM
ABOUT ME BECAUSE I DON'T
GO WITH YOU, RIGHT?

1172
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:24,601
TCH! MY HERO.

1173
00:56:24,601 --> 00:56:28,806
IS IT MY FAULT
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
TO BE A GUY?

1174
00:56:28,873 --> 00:56:30,740
WHAT?

1175
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:31,575
IS IT MY FAULT

1176
00:56:31,575 --> 00:56:34,645
THAT I WASN'T BORN
WITH A PROMINENT
SISSY GENE?

1177
00:56:34,645 --> 00:56:38,082
IS IT MY FAULT
THERE ARE MEN
WHO LOOK GOOD

1178
00:56:38,082 --> 00:56:39,550
WITHOUT 6 POUNDS
OF FACE PAINT?

1179
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:41,518
IS THAT MY FAULT?
IT AIN'T MY FUCKING
FAULT.

1180
00:56:41,518 --> 00:56:45,873
YEAH, WHOSE FAULT
IS IT THAT YOU'RE
SUCH A PRICK?

1181
00:56:58,436 --> 00:57:00,270
YOU WANNA LEAD
A LITTLE WHILE?

1182
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:04,174
MM-MM.
IT'S NICE TO FOLLOW
FOR A CHANGE.

1183
00:57:06,777 --> 00:57:08,680
ROUGH DAY?

1184
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,432
HA. TRY DECADE.

1185
00:57:14,352 --> 00:57:16,621
I NEVER DANCED
WITH A MAN BEFORE.

1186
00:57:16,621 --> 00:57:18,288
OH, GET OUTTA HERE.

1187
00:57:18,288 --> 00:57:19,190
I HAVEN'T.

1188
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:20,357
YOU'RE SERIOUS.

1189
00:57:20,357 --> 00:57:21,126
YEAH.

1190
00:57:21,126 --> 00:57:22,493
NOT EVEN IN PRIVATE?

1191
00:57:22,493 --> 00:57:25,663
I'VE BEEN SO BUSY
FIGHTING FOR
THE RIGHT TO DANCE,

1192
00:57:25,663 --> 00:57:29,567
I--I JUST NEVER
TOOK THE TIME
TO TRY IT.

1193
00:57:29,601 --> 00:57:32,970
WHEN WE FORMED
THE SOCIETY
OVER 15 YEARS AGO,

1194
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:34,606
YOU COULDN'T FIND
3 PEOPLE

1195
00:57:34,606 --> 00:57:38,076
WHO'D EVEN SAY
THE WORD HOMOSEXUAL
IN PUBLIC.

1196
00:57:38,076 --> 00:57:42,012
THEN THIS KID
COMES ALONG WITH
ALL THE ANSWERS,

1197
00:57:42,012 --> 00:57:43,782
LIKE IT'S SO DAMN
EASY.

1198
00:57:43,782 --> 00:57:46,684
YOU CAN'T TELL
THESE YOUNG'UNS NOTHING.

1199
00:57:46,684 --> 00:57:48,353
I WAS NEVER YOUNG.

1200
00:57:48,353 --> 00:57:51,189
WE DIDN'T HAVE
TEENAGERS BACK THEN.

1201
00:57:51,189 --> 00:57:53,925
NO, WE GOT OLD
THE MINUTE WE HIT
PUBERTY.

1202
00:57:53,925 --> 00:57:57,762
OH, I HEAR THAT.
YOU SHOULDA BEEN
A DRAG QUEEN, SWEETNESS.

1203
00:57:57,762 --> 00:57:58,964
NO, SERIOUSLY.

1204
00:57:58,964 --> 00:58:00,431
OUR MOTTO
IS DANCE, DAMN IT,

1205
00:58:00,431 --> 00:58:03,801
'CAUSE HONEY,
THEY MAY BE COMING
FOR YOU IN THE MORNING,

1206
00:58:03,801 --> 00:58:07,339
SO YOU MAY AS WELL DANCE
ALL NIGHT.

1207
00:58:07,339 --> 00:58:08,039
SORRY.

1208
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:11,809
I'M JUST YOUR
PLAIN OLD VANILLA-
FLAVORED HOMO.

1209
00:58:11,809 --> 00:58:14,480
NO KINKS. NO TWISTS.
NO ADDITIVES.

1210
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,081
PLENTY OF NUTS,
THOUGH.

1211
00:58:16,081 --> 00:58:19,184
AND BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

1212
00:58:19,184 --> 00:58:21,987

1386
01:08:14,955 --> 01:08:16,824
UNTIL WE SEE YA BEND

1387
01:08:16,824 --> 01:08:18,459
IF YOU DO NOT
GIVE THEM TO US

1388
01:08:18,459 --> 01:08:20,895
WE WILL TAKE THEM
IN THE END

1389
01:08:20,895 --> 01:08:23,898
AS WE GO MARCHING ON

1390
01:08:25,633 --> 01:08:28,786
GLORY, GLORY HALLELUJAH

1391
01:08:29,236 --> 01:08:32,389
GLORY, GLORY HALLELUJAH

01:08:37,745 --> 01:08:40,749
AS WE GO MARCHING ON

1394
01:08:46,988 --> 01:08:49,124
THANK GOD
THAT'S OVER,

1395
01:08:49,124 --> 01:08:50,591
THE BIG ONE.

1396
01:08:50,591 --> 01:08:51,159
HUH?

1397
01:08:51,159 --> 01:08:54,462
AT LEAST
NO ONE GOT KILLED.

1398
01:08:56,164 --> 01:08:57,933
YOU WANT COFFEE?

1399
01:08:57,933 --> 01:08:59,001
NO MILK,
PLENTY OF SUGAR.

1400
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:02,454
MAYBE IT WOULD'VE
BEEN BETTER.

1401
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:03,706
WHAT?

1402
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:06,408
IF WE'D ALL
BEEN KILLED.

1403
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:08,476
IF THE WHOLE MARCH
HAD BEEN WIPED OUT

1404
01:09:08,476 --> 01:09:10,245
BY A GRENADE
OR SOMETHING.

1405
01:09:10,245 --> 01:09:12,381
AT LEAST IT WOULD
HAVE MADE THE PAPERS.

1406
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:14,416
MAYBE THAT WOULD'VE
MOBILIZED PEOPLE.

1407
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:16,617
THERE'S GOTTA BE
MORE THAN 30 PEOPLE

1408
01:09:16,617 --> 01:09:18,421
WHO ACTUALLY
GIVE A SHIT.

1409
01:09:18,421 --> 01:09:20,589
WE NEED SOMETHING
TO GET 'EM OUT OF

1410
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:21,724
WHATEVER HOLE
THEY'RE IN.

1411
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:24,459
WELL, A LOT OF
THOSE PEOPLE ARE
JUST NOT ABLE

1412
01:09:24,459 --> 01:09:26,095
TO EVEN CONCEIVE OF
THESE ISSUES,

1413
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:27,129
LET ALONE
MARCH FOR THEM.

1414
01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:30,432
THAT DITZY QUEEN
WE WERE TALKING WITH
THE OTHER DAY?

1415
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:31,166
LaMIRANDA?

1416
01:09:31,166 --> 01:09:32,200
HIM.
HE'S GONNA MARCH?

1417
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,503
HE COULD BARELY
CROSS THE ROOM
IN THOSE HEELS.

1418
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:36,305
SHE PREFERS TO
BE CALLED HER.

1419
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:37,673
WELL,
THERE YOU HAVE IT.

1420
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:40,809
I ASKED HER WHY
THEY PREFER TO
BE CALLED "HER".

1421
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:43,112
SHE SAID
THE FEMININE
WAS THE HIGHEST

1422
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:45,013
ANY MALE
COULD ASPIRE TO.

1423
01:09:45,013 --> 01:09:46,181
I KNOW YOU'RE
PARAPHRASING,

1424
01:09:46,181 --> 01:09:50,086
'CAUSE NO WAY
IS THAT IN HIS
VOCABULARY.

1425
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:52,755
O.K.

1426
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:54,222
PACK YOUR BAGS.

1427
01:09:54,222 --> 01:09:55,524
WE NEED A HOLIDAY.

1428
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:57,159
I'M TAKING YOU
TO FIRE ISLAND

1429
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:58,494
FOR A COUPLE
OF DAYS.

1430
01:09:58,494 --> 01:10:00,063
BRING A SWIMSUIT,
SOME SHADES,

1431
01:10:00,063 --> 01:10:01,564
AND A FRIVOLOUS
ATTITUDE.

1432
01:10:01,564 --> 01:10:03,098
I HAVE TO
WORK TOMORROW.

1433
01:10:03,098 --> 01:10:04,067
WHO DOESN'T?

1434
01:10:04,067 --> 01:10:05,401
CALL IN SICK.

1435
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:05,935
COME ON, MATT.

1436
01:10:05,935 --> 01:10:07,803
YOU CAN ADVANCE
YOUR DISHWASHING
CAREER

1437
01:10:07,803 --> 01:10:09,638
AFTER
A LONG WEEKEND.

1438
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:10,639
WE NEED TO
SURROUND YOU

1439
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:14,243
WITH POSITIVE IMAGES
OF FAGGOTRY,

1440
01:10:14,477 --> 01:10:16,980
RIGHT NOW.

1441
01:10:22,819 --> 01:10:24,686
DO THIS WITH ME,
HUH?

1442
01:10:24,686 --> 01:10:28,040
I WANNA SEE
YOU SMILE AGAIN.

1443
01:10:28,258 --> 01:10:31,060
SOUNDS TERRIFIC.

1444
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,775
FORGIVE ME, FATHER,

1445
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:19,677
FOR I HAVE SINNED.

1446
01:11:19,677 --> 01:11:21,679
IT'S BEEN A LIFETIME
SINCE MY LAST
CONFESSION,

1447
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:23,113
AND UH--EVERY SIN,
FATHER,

1448
01:11:23,113 --> 01:11:24,481
I'VE COMMITTED
EVERY SIN,

1449
01:11:24,481 --> 01:11:27,485
LUST, GREED,
ANGER...

1450
01:11:27,885 --> 01:11:30,437
EVEN PRIDE.

1451
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:31,588
WHO AM I TO
FEEL PRIDE?

1452
01:11:31,588 --> 01:11:33,890
A MAN WHO HAS
EVERYTHING...

1453
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:35,693
IN FACT ACTUALLY
HAS NOTHING.

1454
01:11:35,693 --> 01:11:39,329
THE ONLY
THING I WANT
IS THE ONE THING

1455
01:11:39,329 --> 01:11:41,031
THAT I DO HAVE,

1456
01:11:41,031 --> 01:11:43,434
AND I AIN'T
ALLOWED TO WANT IT.

1457
01:11:43,434 --> 01:11:44,101
SO...

1458
01:11:44,101 --> 01:11:45,436
I DON'T REALLY
HAVE IT.

1459
01:11:45,436 --> 01:11:48,488
BUT THAT'S ME,
FATHER.

1460
01:11:49,339 --> 01:11:51,892
THIS IS ME.

1461
01:11:53,578 --> 01:11:56,580
FORGIVE ME,
FATHER...

1462
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:59,883
FOR I HAVE SINNED.

1463
01:12:02,152 --> 01:12:05,356
SEEMS LIKE THE OTHER DAY

1464
01:12:05,790 --> 01:12:08,642
MY BABY WENT AWAY

1465
01:12:09,127 --> 01:12:12,430
HE WENT AWAY
ACROSS THE SEA

1466
01:12:16,167 --> 01:12:18,903
IT'S BEEN 2 YEARS OR SO

1467
01:12:18,903 --> 01:12:21,957
SINCE I SAW
MY BABY GO

1468
01:12:22,908 --> 01:12:26,461
AND THEN THIS LETTER
CAME FOR ME

1469
01:12:29,715 --> 01:12:33,068
HE SAID THAT
WE WERE THROUGH

1470
01:12:33,418 --> 01:12:36,572
HE'D FOUND SOMEBODY NEW

1471
01:12:36,688 --> 01:12:38,990
OH, LET ME THINK,
LET ME THINK

1472
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:41,692
WHAT CAN I DO?

1473
01:12:43,862 --> 01:12:45,731
OH NO

1474
01:12:45,731 --> 01:12:47,265
OH NO

1475
01:12:47,265 --> 01:12:50,169
OH, NO NO NO NO NO

1476
01:12:50,869 --> 01:12:51,637
REMEMBER

1477
01:12:51,637 --> 01:12:54,338
WALKIN' IN THE SAND

1478
01:12:54,338 --> 01:12:55,073
REMEMBER

1479
01:12:55,073 --> 01:12:57,843
WALKIN' HAND IN HAND

1480
01:12:57,843 --> 01:12:58,543
REMEMBER

1481
01:12:58,543 --> 01:13:01,045
THE NIGHT
WAS SO EXCITING

1482
01:13:01,045 --> 01:13:01,747
REMEMBER

1483
01:13:01,747 --> 01:13:04,482
HIS SMILE
WAS SO INVITING

1484
01:13:04,482 --> 01:13:05,384
REMEMBER

1485
01:13:05,384 --> 01:13:07,586
WHEN HE TOUCHED
MY CHEEK

1486
01:13:07,586 --> 01:13:08,420
REMEMBER

1487
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:11,373
WITH HIS FINGERTIPS

1488
01:13:12,257 --> 01:13:13,625
SOFTLY

1489
01:13:13,625 --> 01:13:16,395
SOFTLY WE'D MEET

1490
01:13:16,395 --> 01:13:18,764
WITH OUR LIPS

1491
01:13:18,764 --> 01:13:21,768
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO

1492
01:13:22,301 --> 01:13:25,504
THE BOY
THAT I ONCE KNEW?

1493
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:28,974
THE BOY WHO SAID
HE'D BE TRUE

1494
01:13:33,212 --> 01:13:35,515
OH, WHAT WILL
HAPPEN TO...

1495

[INAUDIBLE CHATTERING]

OH, IT'S COLD!
OW!

1497
01:13:40,686 --> 01:13:42,488
NOW TELL ME,
AM I CONFUSED?

1498
01:13:42,488 --> 01:13:44,590
DID WE DIE AND JUST
GO TO HEAVEN?

1499
01:13:44,590 --> 01:13:46,158
THIS PLACE
HAS IT ALL.

1500
01:13:46,158 --> 01:13:46,959
REMEMBER

1501
01:13:46,959 --> 01:13:48,694
WAIT UNTIL LATER
AT THE DANCE.

1502
01:13:48,694 --> 01:13:51,031
YOU'LL SEE MORE
BEAUTIFUL MEN
IN ONE ROOM

1503
01:13:51,031 --> 01:13:54,233

DREAMED OF.

1504
01:14:00,473 --> 01:14:02,825
AAAHHH!

[LOUD WHISTLE]

1506
01:14:04,043 --> 01:14:06,446
PUT YOUR TOWEL ON,
MATTY.

1507
01:14:06,446 --> 01:14:07,280
WHAT?

1508
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,482
LOCAL ORDINANCE
FROM THE DARK AGES.

1509
01:14:09,482 --> 01:14:11,050
YOU CAN'T WEAR
SUGGESTIVE SWIMSUITS

ON THE BEACH.

1511
01:14:13,286 --> 01:14:14,454
YOU MEAN WE CAN'T.

1512

DON'T GIVE
THESE ASSHOLES
ANY EXCUSES,

O.K., MATTY?

1514
01:14:26,699 --> 01:14:30,303
DID WE JUST DIE
AND GO TO HEAVEN?

1515
01:14:31,437 --> 01:14:34,690
SOMEWHERE OVER
THE RAINBOW

1516
01:14:38,278 --> 01:14:40,830
WAY UP HIGH

1517
01:14:42,349 --> 01:14:45,803
THERE'S A LAND
THAT I HEARD OF

1518
01:14:47,821 --> 01:14:50,673

THE PUNISHING

NOT DEAL WITH

ONLY TO FIND
