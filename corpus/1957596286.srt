[intriguing music]

3
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,285
[Martin] Rivka, I like the
weather this time of year.

4
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:03,576
Do you like the
weather this time of year?

5
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,410
[Woman] So, what do you think?

6
00:01:05,434 --> 00:01:07,076
[Shirley]
You don't want to know.

7
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,618
Which one?

8
00:01:08,642 --> 00:01:11,243
Umm, the best we have.

9
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:12,952
Because you
never know.

10
00:01:12,976 --> 00:01:14,517
Right? Okay.

11
00:01:18,267 --> 00:01:20,267
Oh, you made cookies.

12
00:01:21,434 --> 00:01:23,952
Sweetheart, come here.

13
00:01:23,976 --> 00:01:25,868
[kissing]

14
00:01:25,892 --> 00:01:27,035
Look at you.

15
00:01:27,059 --> 00:01:29,910
The daughter of one of
your father's friends is here,

16
00:01:29,934 --> 00:01:32,618
and she just graduated
from Hofstra.

17
00:01:32,642 --> 00:01:34,242
You're making it a point
to tell me this?

18
00:01:34,266 --> 00:01:36,743
Oh shush, sweetie, it was
just a last minute thing.

19
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:38,910
Yeah, last minute thing
like arranged a month ago.

20
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:40,201
Oh, be nice.

21
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,285
[Celeste] I did.

22
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:44,285
Well, well, well. Look who
finally decided to show up?

23
00:01:44,309 --> 00:01:46,493
Oh, Martin, make
the introductions.

24
00:01:46,517 --> 00:01:48,618
Oh sure, this is
my son, Nelson,

25
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,684
- and this is...
- Celeste Levitz.

26
00:01:51,025 --> 00:01:53,576
- Hi.
- Whoa. Okay.

27
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,493
Nice to meet you,
Celeste Levitz.

28
00:01:55,517 --> 00:01:57,309
Oh, it's my pleasure entirely.

29
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,344
[grunting]

30
00:02:01,232 --> 00:02:02,910
Dinner is served.

31
00:02:02,934 --> 00:02:04,994
Shall we go in
the dining room?

32
00:02:05,018 --> 00:02:06,410
Let's go eat.

33
00:02:06,434 --> 00:02:07,892
Come, Martin.

34
00:02:08,392 --> 00:02:10,100
Oh, this is gonna be
the dinner from hell.

42
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:48,430
[Shirley] Honey, what do you
really know about this girl?

43
00:03:48,454 --> 00:03:50,985
Celeste? She lives in
great neck, nice parents,

44

belong to the
country club,

45

major contributors to the
synagogue, disgustingly rich.

46
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:57,276
Except for the
disgustingly rich part,

47
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,318
I don't think she's
for Nelson.

48
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:01,110
- Notice that, did ya?
- I did.

49
00:04:01,134 --> 00:04:02,735
So why did you invite her here?

50
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:05,401
What do you mean why did I invite
her here? You suggested it.

51
00:04:05,425 --> 00:04:07,985
All I said was Larry Levitz'
daughter was home from school.

52
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:09,409
You were ready to
call the caterers.

53
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:12,568
Dad, what is it with these
girls you're introducing me to?

54
00:04:12,592 --> 00:04:14,235
I... it's her.

55
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:16,239
I'm not worried about you.

56
00:04:16,263 --> 00:04:20,735
Well, you guys should know
that there's someone in my life.

57
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,938
There is?

58
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,902
Really?

59
00:04:24,926 --> 00:04:27,967
Mazel, mazel, mazel tov.

60
00:04:28,383 --> 00:04:29,526
Who is she?

61
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,985
I was gonna tell you.

62
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:33,268
Well, what are you
waiting for, the Messiah?

63
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:35,717
Is it serious?

64
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:38,943
Yeah. You could say that.

65
00:04:38,967 --> 00:04:40,068
Great.

66
00:04:40,092 --> 00:04:42,443

Nobody's calling the rabbi yet.

70
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,610
- Shhh.
- Dad's right.

71
00:04:51,634 --> 00:04:55,276
I, uh, I'll tell you
guys when I'm ready.

72
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,194
Okay, but I can be happy.

73
00:04:57,218 --> 00:04:58,818
I'm so happy.

[jazz music]

75
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:08,442
Angelo, Sybil,
I'm sorry I'm late.

76
00:05:08,466 --> 00:05:09,868
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

77
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,802
- Hey.
- How do I look?

78
00:05:12,826 --> 00:05:15,027
- Deliciously divine.
- And me?

79
00:05:15,051 --> 00:05:16,677
You two make a
beautiful couple.

80
00:05:16,701 --> 00:05:18,651
[laughing]

81
00:05:18,675 --> 00:05:20,218
- Tickets.
- Let's go.

82
00:05:21,383 --> 00:05:22,783
Shirley, you got
to leave him alone.

83
00:05:22,807 --> 00:05:24,651
He doesn't need
you to find women.

84
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:26,027
I'm just concerned.

85
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:28,693
I mean, how many more sons am
I gonna have in this life, huh?

86
00:05:28,717 --> 00:05:31,776
Um, with me? None.

87
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,568
[Shirley] I just want to
know who he's with.

88
00:05:33,592 --> 00:05:36,985
My son is out there all by himself.
He's all alone.

89
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:40,396
Your son is fine.
He's a healthy, confident young man.

90
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,971
But who is she?
We don't know anything about her.

91
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:46,443
I mean, for all we know,
she could be my age.

92
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:47,735
Don't be silly.

93
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,318
Yeah, well that's
what's in today.

94
00:05:49,342 --> 00:05:52,509
- Young boys with...
- Young boys with what?

95
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:54,209
[Shirley] Well, is she Jewish?

96
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:55,913
I mean, we don't even
know if she's Jewish.

97
00:05:55,937 --> 00:05:57,952
How could I have forgotten
to ask if she's Jewish?

98
00:05:57,976 --> 00:05:59,276
How could I do that?

99
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,318
I have no idea
if she's Jewish.

100
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:04,252
- Oy, oy, oy.
- What if she's black?

101
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:07,626
That's all I need is a schwarza
running around in my family.

102
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,273
I don't care if she's
blue, purple or green.

103
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:12,775
Polka dots might bother me.

Who are you?

108
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,543
I'm Angelo Ferraro, and
whom do I have the pleasure?

109
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:47,376
Well, I'm Mrs. Hirsch.
I'm Nelson's mother.

110
00:06:48,313 --> 00:06:49,835
What? You want
to see my ID?

111
00:06:49,859 --> 00:06:53,845
No, no, no. Sorry. Excuse me.
Please, come in.

112
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:55,173
Thank you.

113
00:06:58,316 --> 00:07:00,710
I thought that Nelson
would be home by now.

114
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:03,418
Oh, he just called.

115
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:04,918
Oh, thank you.

116
00:07:04,942 --> 00:07:07,755
Yeah, you can probably
still reach him at the office.

117
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,835
Have we met?

118
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,168
I'm Nelson's decorator.

119
00:07:13,192 --> 00:07:15,432
Yeah, just kind of making some
suggestions here and there

120
00:07:15,456 --> 00:07:17,168
and pray to the
almighty that he listens.

121

[laughs]

122
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,376
Well, I've never seen this
apartment looking so beautiful.

123
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,002
- Oh, you really think so?
- I do.

124
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,418
In fact, I wonder if you
would come out to my house

125
00:07:27,442 --> 00:07:28,960
and give me a little advice.

126
00:07:28,984 --> 00:07:31,002
Oh, I would be delighted.

127
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:32,732
I would love that.

So nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

133
00:07:47,109 --> 00:07:48,751
Likewise, I assure you.

134
00:07:48,775 --> 00:07:51,638
I live downstairs,
and your darling son

135

lets me use his
Jacuzzi all the time.

- Oh, really? Jacuzzi?
- Um-hmm.

137

- Sybil?
- Uh-huh.

138
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:00,976
May I have a word with
you, maybe privately?

139
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,864
Oh yeah. I, um, I actually was
going to go get some candles

140
00:08:04,888 --> 00:08:07,407
for the apartment.
All right. Bye.

141
00:08:10,084 --> 00:08:12,667
Sybil, I want to
talk to you.

142
00:08:24,376 --> 00:08:26,018
You know, I'm from California,

143
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:28,435
and these lips refuse to give
into the New York weather.

144
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:30,211
Yes, I know.

145
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:34,601
[gasping]

146
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,619
Is there something wrong?

147
00:08:36,643 --> 00:08:38,559
No, no, no, no, no. [chuckles]

148
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:43,297
I don't...
I mean, I'm fine, and you're fine,

149
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:45,310
and I thank you very
much for everything.

150
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:50,004
Oh, sure. I just thought
maybe you'd want to, you know?

151
00:08:50,334 --> 00:08:53,185
What? Not me.
I'm not like that.

152
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:55,810
You don't have to
worry about that with me.

153
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:57,917
Well, I'm not
worried about it.

154
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,143
Have I seen you
somewhere before?

155
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:06,143
Sure. Have you read
playpen this month, maybe?

156
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:09,060
Oh, playpen, oh. [chuckles]

157
00:09:09,084 --> 00:09:11,060
Why, do you have a problem
with that, Mrs. Hirsch?

158
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:14,394
Oh, no, no. It's just...
It's very interesting.

159
00:09:14,418 --> 00:09:15,951
[laughs]

160
00:09:15,975 --> 00:09:18,143
Would you like to join me?

161
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,856
I mean, there's
room in here for two.

162
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,976
- No, no, no.
- Nelson and I always fit.

163
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,310
I'm already very clean.

164
00:09:25,334 --> 00:09:26,352
Okay.

165
00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:28,518
But thank you.
You're so kind.

166
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:30,299
Thank you for inviting me.

167
00:09:30,323 --> 00:09:33,050
- [chuckles] Okay.
- Maybe some other time.

168
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:36,640
Nelson and you take
jacuzzis together?

169
00:09:36,664 --> 00:09:40,310
Oh, all the time.
We love it. [chuckles]

170
00:09:40,334 --> 00:09:42,779
Well, you know, we do more
than just Jacuzzi together.

171
00:09:42,803 --> 00:09:46,223
We go to the theater.
We go to dance clubs.

172
00:09:46,247 --> 00:09:48,410
We like to, you know,

173
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:49,743
- boogie.
- Boogie?

174
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:50,785
Yeah, boogie.

175
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:52,076
And he handles
my finances

176
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,395
because I don't know
anything about money.

177
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,243
Bubeleh, I am so happy that
you and Nelson are so close,

178
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:03,118
but, please, enjoy your
Jacuzzi. Carry on.

179
00:10:03,142 --> 00:10:05,243
[chuckles] I will.

180
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:07,434
[sighs]

181
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:11,743
- Sybil?
- Mrs. Hirsch?

182
00:10:11,767 --> 00:10:14,184
Oh, no, no.
Please, just call me Shirley.

183
00:10:15,646 --> 00:10:19,687
Sybil, I want to know how
you really feel about my son.

184
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:28,546
Nelson is a lovely, caring,
wonderful person,

185
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,319
so sweet. [chuckles] We
have so much fun together.

186
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:36,188
He's very, really,
you know, special.

187
00:10:36,718 --> 00:10:39,660
Beautiful.
Beautiful.

188
00:10:39,684 --> 00:10:44,184
Uh, by the way, what college
did you say you graduated from?

189
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,833
I didn't say, but if
it interests you,

190
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:50,618
it was a private institution.

191
00:10:50,642 --> 00:10:52,618
A private institution? Oh.

192
00:10:52,642 --> 00:10:56,243
Yes, very, very private.

193
00:10:56,871 --> 00:10:59,118
Very private?
Well good.

194
00:10:59,142 --> 00:11:01,600
- Yeah.
- Excellent. That is great.

195
00:11:01,624 --> 00:11:03,993
[chuckling]

196
00:11:06,057 --> 00:11:08,410
[to herself] Sybil?
Is that a Jewish name?

197
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,892
I don't think so.

198
00:11:10,821 --> 00:11:13,874
[bright music]

199
00:11:18,184 --> 00:11:19,683
Tateleh.

200
00:11:23,742 --> 00:11:26,201
Uh, Linda.

201
00:11:28,326 --> 00:11:31,510
- Linda, this is...
- Oh, hi, Mrs. Hirsch.

202
00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:33,385
This is, new. Okay?

203
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:35,801
Take care of that. Thanks.

204
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:37,718
Shirley?
What are you...?

205
00:11:37,742 --> 00:11:40,652
That my dear,
is Nelson's girlfriend.

206
00:11:41,798 --> 00:11:43,010
What?

207
00:11:43,034 --> 00:11:45,409
- Go in my office.
- Okay.

208
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:57,603
Wow. Are you kidding?

209
00:11:58,034 --> 00:12:01,176
Nelson is dating
a centerfold?

210
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,843
No. She is the centerfold
of the month,

211
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:08,718
and as I suspected,
I think she's a shiksha.

212
00:12:08,742 --> 00:12:10,051
[Martin] Who cares?

213
00:12:10,075 --> 00:12:11,326
Martin.

214
00:12:12,326 --> 00:12:13,759
How do you know
she's not Jewish?

215
00:12:13,783 --> 00:12:16,950
Because I just came from
his apartment. I met her.

216
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:19,676
- Martin?
- Huh?

217
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,620
You can put your tongue
back into your mouth now.

218
00:12:21,644 --> 00:12:23,996
What'd you do? You barged
into his house, right?

219
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,220
You shouldn't
do that, Shirley.

220
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,635
Don't be ridiculous.
Mother's barge, and I'm his mother,

221
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:29,176
so I have barging rights.

222
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,360
Nelson's 25 years old.
He's a grown man.

223
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:32,985
I am still his mother.

224
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:34,769
I don't think you have
a right to spy on 'em.

225
00:12:34,793 --> 00:12:36,942
Don't tell me
about my rights.

226
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:40,718
Look at her,
just look at her.

227
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:45,235
You could stop
looking at her now.

228
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:47,339
A centerfold fell for
my boy. I'm proud of 'em.

229
00:12:47,363 --> 00:12:49,652
- You are...
- Good morning, Shirley.

230
00:12:49,676 --> 00:12:51,652
Good morning,
uncle Moishe.

231
00:12:51,676 --> 00:12:54,235
- You going to the toilet?
- No.

232
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:56,610
Come on. It's my magazine,
uncle Moishe.

233
00:12:56,634 --> 00:12:57,818
- Yours?
- Yeah.

234
00:12:57,842 --> 00:13:00,402
Good.
Take it home with you.

235
00:13:00,426 --> 00:13:02,826
Don't leave it here if you want
your husband to get some work

236
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,402
done today so he can feed you
and the rest of the family.

237
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:08,771
I thought we were rich enough so
that Martin didn't have to work

238
00:13:08,795 --> 00:13:10,818
as hard anymore, he
could take it a little easy.

239
00:13:10,842 --> 00:13:13,443
We're not so rich that he
can waste his time reading

240
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:16,610
that cockamamie garbage
during working hours.

241
00:13:16,634 --> 00:13:18,318
Did you finish the
shipment to Japan?

242
00:13:18,342 --> 00:13:20,043
Here. If you go out.
You'll take a look.

243
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,001
You'll see it's almost
all done, all right?

244
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:23,942
You won't miss it.

245
00:13:25,067 --> 00:13:27,335
I have no idea why I
still work for that man.

246
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:28,627
Don't be a schmeggege.

247
00:13:28,651 --> 00:13:32,876
You're the only family he's got,
and he pays you a lot of money,

248
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,794
and one day you're gonna
inherit this entire business.

249
00:13:35,818 --> 00:13:38,637
One day? Yeah? You think so?
I don't think he's ever gonna die.

250
00:13:38,661 --> 00:13:40,001
Oh, everybody dies.

251
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:41,168
Not him.

252
00:13:41,192 --> 00:13:43,585
[Shirley] He's 80 years old.

253
00:13:43,609 --> 00:13:44,918
For him, that's middle-aged.

254
00:13:44,942 --> 00:13:47,418
[laughs]

255
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:50,644
- You know, I think I like her.
- Yeah?

256
00:13:50,668 --> 00:13:52,835
I mean, she seemed
like a nice girl.

257
00:13:52,859 --> 00:13:54,001
Great.

258
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:56,852
Except how do we
explain her to him?

259
00:13:56,876 --> 00:13:58,476
Who cares?
What does it matter?

260
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,685
If uncle Moishe
ever finds out

261
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:02,685
that your son
is marrying a shiksha

262
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:05,351
playpen centerfold
of the month,

263
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,976
he'll can your ass
on the spot.

264
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,018
He'll run to his lawyer,
and he'll change the will.

265
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:12,185
What do you expect me
to do about that, Shirley?

266
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:14,986
Oh, as usual,
do what you do best.

267
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:16,542
Do nothing.

268
00:14:18,143 --> 00:14:19,942
- Marty?
- Yeah?

269
00:14:19,966 --> 00:14:23,101
Why don't you come over
here with the real men?

270
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,172
I'm over here with
the real weights.

271
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:28,393
You got time for
some Texas hold 'em?

272
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:31,420
Uh, no. Shirley and I
are busy tonight.

273
00:14:32,751 --> 00:14:34,727
You gonna hump tonight?

274
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,727
I don't think that everybody
in the entire gym heard you.

275
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,226
Jesus, Max.

276
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,768
Not everything is about sex.

277
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:44,292
You are getting old.

278
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,894
You got nothing
to worry about.

279
00:14:49,918 --> 00:14:52,476
Your father lived
to be 103 years old,

280
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,268
schtooping
all the way.

281
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:57,018
Your obsessed
with this subject.

282
00:14:57,042 --> 00:14:59,268
Just like my uncle moishe.
He's 80.

283
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:00,976
Uncle moishe
still schtoops?

284
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,393
- You like that word, huh?
- Yeah.

285
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:05,435
Apparently, women like the
sound of crackling old bones

286
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:08,852
as long as it comes with the
sound of crackling old money.

287
00:15:08,876 --> 00:15:11,101
Money can buy
you anything.

288
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,602
Can't buy love, Max.

289
00:15:12,626 --> 00:15:14,518
You just won't spend enough.

290
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:16,476
I'm talking about
true love, Max.

291
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,727
Marty, it can and will
buy anything.

292
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:21,685
What are you saying,
that I bought your sister?

293
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:23,602
Are you kidding?
She was on special.

294
00:15:23,626 --> 00:15:25,013
[laughs]

295
00:15:26,876 --> 00:15:29,351
So how's that nephew,
the boychik, Nelson?

296
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,185
Is he still making a
killing in real estate?

297
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:33,207
Yes. He's doing well, thanks.

298
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:34,709
Schtooping?

299
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,518
Uh, yes. I guess he is.
I'm sure he is.

300
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:40,751
Like father, like son.

301
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:45,989
I've given this
a lot of thought and,

302
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:49,518
I think it's time that you know
what's going on in my life.

303
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:52,185
Yes, yes, honey.
I know all about her.

304
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:55,426
[on phone] What? No, no, no.
Mom, you're not listening.

305
00:15:56,294 --> 00:15:59,268
There is no she in my life.

306
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,685
Yes, dear. Martin, where is my

307
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:04,949
super moisturizing Mac day cream?

308
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:08,351
I don't believe your
father uses my creams.

309
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,685
He thinks they make
him look younger.

310
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:12,308
Old men are so stupid.

311
00:16:12,332 --> 00:16:14,986
You know they only work on women.
[chuckles]

312
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,976
Anyway, where the
hell were we, huh?

313
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,101
Oh yes, I am warning you

314
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,476
that I am going to start
a full fledged campaign

315
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,018
to get her out here
and introduce her

316
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:25,910
to the whole family.

317
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:27,994
Well, maybe not
the whole family.

318
00:16:28,018 --> 00:16:29,201
Oh, you know what?

319
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:31,385
You could invite her to your
cousin's wedding tomorrow.

320
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:34,194
- Mom, I...
- Oh, maybe not. I don't know.

321
00:16:34,218 --> 00:16:35,910
This is so hard for me to tell you,

322
00:16:35,934 --> 00:16:38,368
and you're not
making it any easier.

323
00:16:38,392 --> 00:16:40,183
Yes dear, yes, yes, yes.

324
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:42,743
I'm gay--

325
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:45,744
God, Andrea, where
is my hairbrush?

326
00:16:45,768 --> 00:16:47,201
Oh here it is.

327
00:16:47,225 --> 00:16:49,118
Andrea, have you
been using this brush?

328
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,326
This is not my
tangled hair in here.

329
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,035
- Ugh.
- No. Leave alone.

330
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:56,285
- Ugh.
- Mom, please listen to me.

331
00:16:56,309 --> 00:16:57,493
You have no idea

332
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,868
the IQ level I am dealing
with in this household.

333
00:17:00,892 --> 00:17:02,660
All right, go on. Go on.

334
00:17:02,684 --> 00:17:04,095
Mom, I'm...

335
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:07,035
- Gay.
- Oy vey iz mir.

336
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,159
Again, your
mother's being tortured.

337
00:17:09,183 --> 00:17:11,159
Where are my tweezers?

338
00:17:11,183 --> 00:17:13,952
You know, honey, I am so late.
I'm hysterical.

339
00:17:13,976 --> 00:17:16,159
Let's talk about
this tomorrow, okay?

340
00:17:16,183 --> 00:17:17,576
I'm sending you love.

341
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,530
I'm sending you hugs and kisses
and give tootsy face my love, okay?

342
00:17:22,554 --> 00:17:23,910
[kisses]

343
00:17:23,934 --> 00:17:27,100
I love you. I love you.
I love you. Bye bye.

344
00:17:28,217 --> 00:17:30,259
Oy yoy yoy.

345
00:17:30,642 --> 00:17:31,851
Not bad.

346
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,405
Hey.

347
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:43,684
Hi.

348
00:17:44,767 --> 00:17:45,977
What's the matter?

349
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:47,994
My mother's the matter.

350
00:17:48,018 --> 00:17:51,346
Like I've always said, if it's
not one thing, it's your mother.

351
00:17:53,684 --> 00:17:55,726
I tried to tell
her about us today.

352
00:17:56,805 --> 00:17:58,041
And?

353
00:17:58,434 --> 00:18:00,851
She's too wrapped up in
her own world to listen.

354
00:18:01,316 --> 00:18:03,566
Oh, well, it's not
the end of the world.

355
00:18:05,142 --> 00:18:07,201
When I finally tell her,
and she screams gevalt,

356
00:18:07,225 --> 00:18:08,208
it will be the end
of the world.

357
00:18:08,232 --> 00:18:11,357
Hey, like I said,
it's no biggie.

358
00:18:13,684 --> 00:18:15,070
There's more.

359
00:18:16,459 --> 00:18:19,952
She wants to introduce Sybil
to the entire Hirsch family.

360
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,434
Tomorrow at the wedding.

361
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,869
Wait.

362
00:18:27,616 --> 00:18:29,573
You're not taking
me to the wedding?

363
00:18:29,918 --> 00:18:30,935
I didn't say that.

364
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:33,910
Because we agreed to tell both
our families before my birthday.

365
00:18:33,934 --> 00:18:36,410
Yes, I know,
but you...

366
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,479
Maybe we should think about
this a little differently.

367
00:18:40,392 --> 00:18:42,076
Don't you think
that we should

368
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,920
tell our parents
first that we're gay

369
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,233
and let that sink in a little bit,

370
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:50,003
and then when they're
ready to accept it...

371
00:18:50,027 --> 00:18:53,651
Fully accept it... then we
can tell them about us.

372
00:18:55,641 --> 00:18:57,647
You know what?
I could be a bitch, too.

373
00:18:57,671 --> 00:18:59,005
Take Sybil.

374
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:02,289
[melancholic music]

375
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:07,076
It's too soon.

376
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,559
They're not ready yet.

377
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,868
You know, sometimes...

378
00:19:11,892 --> 00:19:14,350
Sometimes it feels like the
whole damn world isn't ready.

379
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:28,892
Hey, hey, hey.

380
00:19:29,704 --> 00:19:31,830
Fucking buckaroo you.

381
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,309
It's your birthday soon.

382
00:19:42,768 --> 00:19:44,385
What do you want to do?

383
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:48,027
You remembered.

384
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,480
You sneaky little
bushy fox.

385
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:59,760
I want to go Brennan's
for breakfast

386
00:19:59,784 --> 00:20:02,547
and then I want to go to
Antoine's for dinner

387
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,052
and then I want to
go to a club,

388
00:20:05,076 --> 00:20:09,315
and I want to dance with you
until the cows come home.

389
00:20:10,492 --> 00:20:14,455
Or, we could have it here.

390
00:20:16,034 --> 00:20:17,992
Nice, warm and intimate.

391
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:21,659
In the apartment?

392
00:20:22,867 --> 00:20:26,176
Oh, right, in the apartment,
where no one can see us.

393
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,575
That's great, Nelson.

394
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,118
It's not what I meant.

[door slams]

396
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,325
Come out, come out, oh Romeo.

397

You shall suffocate
thy fine self in there.

398
00:20:58,051 --> 00:20:59,985
Besides, as far as I'm
concerned, you're out,

399
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,776
and you could never go back in.

400
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,324
I won't let you.

401
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:06,688
[knocking]

402
00:21:11,134 --> 00:21:14,095
I'll huff and I'll puff,
and I'll blow the door down.

403
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:16,093
Angelo?

404
00:21:17,092 --> 00:21:19,110
This isn't funny anymore.

405
00:21:19,134 --> 00:21:21,208
Open this door immediately.

406
00:21:21,232 --> 00:21:22,600
Come on!

[door opens]

408
00:21:52,634 --> 00:21:54,273
Okay, okay.

409
00:21:55,342 --> 00:21:57,190
You can come with me,

410
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:00,496

Oh, you can't wear
that shirt, honey.

427
00:22:42,442 --> 00:22:45,754
You just wore it last week
to aunt Sandy's funeral.

428
00:22:47,593 --> 00:22:49,876
[sighs] Wedding, funeral,
what's the difference?

429
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,002
[Shirley] What was that?

430
00:22:51,026 --> 00:22:53,609
Huh? Yeah, um,
I'm changing the shirt.

431
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:57,622
What are you looking at?

432
00:22:58,026 --> 00:23:00,567
The last time you made a
decision was getting married.

wait until after the wedding?

Mom, I'm bringing someone
very special with me

436
00:23:08,313 --> 00:23:09,335

00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:11,127
[Shirley] That is so exciting.

438
00:23:11,151 --> 00:23:13,294
I know everybody's
gonna love to meet her.

439
00:23:13,318 --> 00:23:16,210
I wish you'd give her a
crash course in being Jewish.

440
00:23:16,234 --> 00:23:17,710
She'll come to a
Jewish wedding.

No, no.

which means he wants to
introduce her to the family,

458
00:24:02,251 --> 00:24:04,394
which means
he's serious about her,

459

and if he's serious about her,

460
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:08,915
we have to get serious
about her, too.

out in the open.

are we happy?

happy, we're happy.

How do you know that?

Doesn't sound
Jewish to me?

523
00:26:55,683 --> 00:26:57,202
Who's not Jewish?

524
00:26:57,226 --> 00:26:58,785
Oh, uncle Moishe.

525
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:00,576
Who is not Jewish?

526
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,500
The president.

527
00:27:02,524 --> 00:27:03,910
So, where's Nelson?
Is he here?

528
00:27:03,934 --> 00:27:05,839
No, he's not here yet.

529
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:07,695
What's your problem?

530
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:08,937
[grunts]

531
00:27:09,434 --> 00:27:12,010
Uncle Moishe, he can turn
any day into Yom Kippur.

532
00:27:12,034 --> 00:27:15,176
Yeah, and look at my darling
meshugganah sister-in-law.

533
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,648
She is telling the whole
congregation about Nelson already.

534
00:27:18,672 --> 00:27:21,190
Oh, here they are.

535
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:22,734
Who's that with him?

536
00:27:23,117 --> 00:27:26,552
Oh, that's his painter,
decorator guy.

537
00:27:26,576 --> 00:27:28,176
What's he doing here?

538
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,218
How the hell should I know?
I didn't invite him.

539
00:27:30,242 --> 00:27:31,850
Hey.

540
00:27:32,373 --> 00:27:33,386
Finally.

541
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,863
Hello.

542
00:27:35,492 --> 00:27:37,592
- Where's, uh...?
- Hi mom.

543
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:40,783
- Hello, Mrs. Hirsch.
- Hello.

544
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,051
Oh, dad, you haven't met Angelo.

545
00:27:45,075 --> 00:27:46,676
Mom just told me.
Decorator?

546
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,644
Yes.
So great to meet you.

547
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:50,759
- Yeah. You, too.
- Let me show you the yamulkes.

548
00:27:50,783 --> 00:27:52,510
This is Andrea,
Nelson's sister.

549
00:27:52,534 --> 00:27:53,854
He would've
figured that out, dad.

550
00:27:53,878 --> 00:27:54,801
Okay.

551
00:27:54,825 --> 00:27:55,939
- Hi.
- Hi.

552
00:27:55,963 --> 00:27:58,985
So, I thought you were
bringing the centerfold?

553
00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:02,385
No, I told you I was bringing
someone very special.

554
00:28:02,409 --> 00:28:06,543
Sybil's special,
but she's not very special.

555
00:28:07,401 --> 00:28:10,565
Well, is she coming?
I mean, we've been waiting for her.

556
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:12,918
- Who?
- Sybil.

557
00:28:15,668 --> 00:28:16,810
She couldn't make it.

558
00:28:16,834 --> 00:28:19,093
[Rabbi] Ladies and
gentlemen, Baruch hashem,

559
00:28:19,117 --> 00:28:21,260
wedding ceremony
is about to begin.

560
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:22,604
[Marty] We better go in, I guess.

561
00:28:22,628 --> 00:28:24,343
Well, I'm gonna miss
seeing her.

562
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:25,885
I don't know if you have one.

563
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:27,189
You have to put one of these on.

564
00:28:27,213 --> 00:28:29,759
Oh, you know what? I actually...
I brought one, so thank you.

565
00:28:29,783 --> 00:28:30,986
Well, where did
you get that?

566
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,010
I made it.

567
00:28:32,034 --> 00:28:33,594
Wow. Look at this.
You made this?

568
00:28:33,618 --> 00:28:34,676
Yeah. You like it?

569
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,343
Yeah. I've never
seen one like it.

570
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:37,676
Yeah. Thanks.

571
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,302
Yeah. Is it on right?

572
00:28:39,326 --> 00:28:41,759
Yes. As long as it's on
your head, it's perfect.

573
00:28:41,783 --> 00:28:43,263
You could make a
killing selling that.

574
00:28:43,287 --> 00:28:44,878
Well, we'll talk
about that later.

575
00:28:57,451 --> 00:29:02,783
[praying in Hebrew]

576
00:29:11,409 --> 00:29:12,867
[All] Amen.

577
00:29:17,992 --> 00:29:22,409
Okay, put it on
the right finger.

578
00:29:23,326 --> 00:29:25,374
Repeat after me.

579
00:29:25,398 --> 00:29:29,190
[repeating Hebrew blessing]

580
00:29:44,469 --> 00:29:48,719
[praying in Hebrew]

581
00:30:00,075 --> 00:30:01,783
Mom, I'm gay.

582
00:30:05,783 --> 00:30:07,010
Mother, I'm gay.

583
00:30:07,034 --> 00:30:08,659
Shhh.

584
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:11,134
I'm gay.

585
00:30:30,442 --> 00:30:32,085
- Martin.
- I'm sorry.

586
00:30:32,109 --> 00:30:34,627
Nelson has something
to say to you.

587
00:30:34,651 --> 00:30:35,854
What?

588
00:30:38,942 --> 00:30:40,251
Dad, I'm gay.

589
00:30:40,275 --> 00:30:42,470
All right. That's good.
That's nice.

590
00:30:42,494 --> 00:30:44,202
Okay.

591
00:30:46,567 --> 00:30:49,629
Your son is a homosexual.

592
00:30:49,942 --> 00:30:51,376
What did you just say?

593
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,627
He said he's gay, dad.

594
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:54,438
Shhh. Andrea, please.

595
00:30:54,462 --> 00:30:57,043
Shhh. The rabbi's gay?

596
00:30:57,067 --> 00:30:59,376
Well, yeah, and
the pope's Jewish.

597
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,627
The rabbi's gay?

598
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:02,267
Shoosh out there!

599
00:31:06,178 --> 00:31:07,585
- Marty?
- Uh-huh?

600
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:09,210
Nelson just said
he's gay.

601
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:12,130
- What?
- He's gay.

602
00:31:12,442 --> 00:31:13,543
Your son.

603
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:14,710
What are you
talking about?

604
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:16,814
What am I talking about?
He's a homosexual. He's gay.

605
00:31:16,838 --> 00:31:17,998
Shirley, we're in a synagogue

606
00:31:18,022 --> 00:31:20,043
- he said it first.
- Said what first?

607
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:23,942
Your son is trying to
tell you that he is gay.

608
00:31:24,776 --> 00:31:27,567
[praying]

609
00:31:46,602 --> 00:31:47,625
[glass breaks]

610
00:31:47,649 --> 00:31:49,485
[Congregation]
Mazel tov!

611
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,699
[applause]

612
00:32:06,129 --> 00:32:09,222
[fire crackling]

613
00:32:11,442 --> 00:32:13,311
Martin, you're drunk.

614
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:17,293
Well, not quite, but I'm getting
there as fast as I can.

615
00:32:17,317 --> 00:32:18,818
Pour me some.

616
00:32:24,032 --> 00:32:25,134
More.

617
00:32:30,242 --> 00:32:32,876
I don't know.
It's usually so obvious.

618
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,460
I know, isn't it?

619
00:32:34,484 --> 00:32:37,835
Like with that decorator guy,
Angelo, it's obvious,

620
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:39,627
but not with our boy,
not with Nelson.

621
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:42,644
Have you ever noticed anything?

622
00:32:42,668 --> 00:32:45,210
Well, he is so sensitive.

623
00:32:45,234 --> 00:32:47,675
He's a lot more
than that now.

624
00:32:49,297 --> 00:32:52,618
Well, you thought he was gonna marry
some bimbo from a sex magazine.

625
00:32:52,642 --> 00:32:55,493
You don't have to worry about
that anymore. You happy now?

626
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:57,660
Happy? What?
Do I look happy?

627
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,785
Do I sound happy?
Am I happy?

628
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:02,159
No, I'm not happy.

629
00:33:02,183 --> 00:33:03,612
[grunting]

630
00:33:03,636 --> 00:33:07,285
Oy vey my son is gay.

631
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:09,423
All right.
That's enough, enough, enough.

632
00:33:10,986 --> 00:33:13,118
All right.
I don't want to talk about it.

633
00:33:13,142 --> 00:33:14,605
What are you doing?

634
00:33:15,018 --> 00:33:16,178
I'm getting tired
of all this.

635
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,702
- Stop it!
- Shit!

636
00:33:17,726 --> 00:33:19,246
I don't want to
think about it anymore.

637
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,520
Let's watch football.

638
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:25,800
Ahh, my boys.

639
00:33:28,857 --> 00:33:30,333
You know you're crazy.

640
00:33:30,357 --> 00:33:31,771
I know.

641
00:33:34,539 --> 00:33:35,845
[sighs]

642
00:33:36,463 --> 00:33:37,950
Honey?

643
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,968
[sighs]

644
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:42,285
Football isn't making me happy.

645
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,172
[sighs]

646
00:33:47,227 --> 00:33:49,707
[TV announcer] According to
Fresno state university researcher,

647
00:33:49,731 --> 00:33:52,285
Melvin Reardon, 43% of
teens in this country

648
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:56,213
now tell pollsters they
are gay, lesbian, bisexual

649
00:33:56,237 --> 00:33:58,493
or questioning their
sexual orientation.

650
00:33:58,517 --> 00:34:00,159
Catholic bishops
throughout the nation

651
00:34:00,183 --> 00:34:01,618
are urging parents
of gay children

652
00:34:01,642 --> 00:34:03,952
to demonstrate love for
their sons and daughters

653
00:34:03,976 --> 00:34:07,329
and to recognize that generally
homosexual orientation

654
00:34:07,353 --> 00:34:09,451
is experienced
as given from birth

655
00:34:09,475 --> 00:34:11,035
not as something
freely chosen.

656
00:34:11,059 --> 00:34:12,451
Catholic bishops
are saying that?

657
00:34:12,475 --> 00:34:13,493
Oh shush, shush.

658
00:34:13,517 --> 00:34:16,462
There is widespread evidence
that homosexuality is a fad

659
00:34:16,486 --> 00:34:18,434
among young people
throughout the nation.

660
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:20,576
More from our
correspondent, Alice Gerble.

661
00:34:20,986 --> 00:34:23,707
[Alice] Here and on college
campuses around the nation,

662
00:34:23,731 --> 00:34:26,068
the term "gay until
graduation", is being used

663
00:34:26,092 --> 00:34:29,068
to describe those
experimenting with gay sex.

664
00:34:29,092 --> 00:34:31,776
Now, recently you changed
your name from John to Jan.

665
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,180
Can you tell us why?

666
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:34,499
I was living a lie.

667
00:34:34,523 --> 00:34:36,610
I've given in to who I am.

668
00:34:36,634 --> 00:34:38,283
Changing my name
from John to Jan

669
00:34:38,307 --> 00:34:40,526
was just my way of feeling
more complete.

670
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:44,068
Well, what about all the controversy
surrounding your decision?

671
00:34:44,092 --> 00:34:45,700
I haven't felt
any negativity.

672
00:34:45,724 --> 00:34:47,468
It's all about freedom.

673
00:34:47,492 --> 00:34:50,052
Freedom to make choices
that bring you happiness.

674
00:34:50,076 --> 00:34:51,301
Thanks so much, Jan.

675
00:34:51,325 --> 00:34:52,843
Well, there ya have it, folks.

676
00:34:52,867 --> 00:34:55,676
Gay isn't just becoming okay.
It's cool.

677
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,700
Reporting live,
I'm Alice Gerble.

678
00:35:00,617 --> 00:35:03,259
What the hell happened to the world
while we were at that wedding?

679
00:35:03,283 --> 00:35:05,052
The world didn't change
overnight, Marty.

680
00:35:05,076 --> 00:35:07,645
It's just we weren't
paying attention.

681
00:35:07,669 --> 00:35:09,102
I don't get it.

682
00:35:09,126 --> 00:35:10,802
How did he get this way?

683
00:35:10,826 --> 00:35:11,968
Huh?

684
00:35:11,992 --> 00:35:14,927
How, why did he...
Do you think it was me?

685
00:35:14,951 --> 00:35:16,751
- I don't think so.
- I don't think so either.

686
00:35:16,775 --> 00:35:19,415
I mean, when I was a kid, I wanted
to schtoop anything that walked.

687
00:35:19,439 --> 00:35:21,793
- Anything that moved.
- Anything in a skirt.

688
00:35:22,492 --> 00:35:24,135
What if it was in
his books, you know?

689
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:25,135
Books? What books?

690
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:27,718
The damn books you wanted me
to read standing on my head

691
00:35:27,742 --> 00:35:30,468
or if I was upside down,
the sumokutro?

692
00:35:30,492 --> 00:35:34,135
- Oh, the kamasutra!
- Kamasutra, 101 positions.

693
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,510
I think we tried them all.

694
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:38,218
What if one night we left
the door open by accident,

695
00:35:38,242 --> 00:35:40,102
and he came by the door.

696
00:35:40,126 --> 00:35:43,022
You think if he saw
us, it scared him?

697
00:35:43,367 --> 00:35:44,640
It scared me.

698
00:35:46,751 --> 00:35:48,010
What's happening
to our boy?

699
00:35:48,034 --> 00:35:49,191
I don't know either.

700
00:35:50,061 --> 00:35:51,510
Maybe it's you.

701
00:35:51,534 --> 00:35:53,010
- Me?
- You, yeah, you.

702
00:35:53,034 --> 00:35:55,802
- What are you talking about me?
- Your side of the family.

703
00:35:55,826 --> 00:35:59,301
My side of the family?
Oh, please. Don't be ridiculous.

704
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:01,218
My grandmother
had 11 children.

705
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,094
Somebody was
doing the schtooping.

706
00:36:03,118 --> 00:36:04,259
I know, but you got to admit

707
00:36:04,283 --> 00:36:06,843
that the men on your side of the
family are a little wishy washy.

708
00:36:06,867 --> 00:36:09,135
Wishy washy?
They're not wishy washy.

709
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:12,635
They're successful huge
businessmen with big families.

710
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:14,802
Oh really, and half the boys
in that family are bald,

711
00:36:14,826 --> 00:36:16,635
which is saying
something about them.

712
00:36:16,659 --> 00:36:19,010
I have no idea what, and the
other half are a little iffy.

713
00:36:19,034 --> 00:36:20,052
Iffy?

714
00:36:20,076 --> 00:36:22,843
- Yeah, like your brother, Max.
- Max? Don't you go there.

715
00:36:22,867 --> 00:36:24,885
You're crossing into
psychotic territory.

716
00:36:24,909 --> 00:36:25,927
Exactly.

717
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:27,551
My brother, Max,
is a wonderful man.

718
00:36:27,575 --> 00:36:29,094
Who is incapable
of having children.

719
00:36:29,118 --> 00:36:31,426
True, true.
But he's still a menchyman.

720
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:35,718
He's a menchyman who spends half
his life in a men's health club.

721
00:36:35,742 --> 00:36:37,010
And so do you.

722
00:36:37,034 --> 00:36:38,176
Not for that reason.

723
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,885
What about your
brother, Eddie?

724
00:36:39,909 --> 00:36:41,760
He is 47 years old,
and he's not married.

725
00:36:41,784 --> 00:36:43,426
My brother, Eddie,
is 45 years old.

726
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,218
- He is 47.
- All right.

727
00:36:45,242 --> 00:36:46,802
And what about your
cousin, Seymour?

728
00:36:46,826 --> 00:36:49,066
- Leave Seymour out of it.
- Oh, Seymour is 42 years old.

729
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,130
- So?
- Never been married.

730
00:36:50,154 --> 00:36:53,593
He lives in San Francisco,
and he is an actor.

731
00:36:53,617 --> 00:36:55,218
- Yeah.
- And that's your family.

732
00:36:55,242 --> 00:36:57,259
Don't you talk about
my family like that.

733
00:36:57,283 --> 00:37:00,218
My father was able
to lift 300 pounds.

734
00:37:00,242 --> 00:37:04,135
The most he ever listed was 300
pounds of his wife's tuchus.

735
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:05,635
At least it was
a female tukhus.

736
00:37:05,659 --> 00:37:07,468
Oh, please.
Just leave me alone.

737
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:08,551
[screaming]

738
00:37:08,575 --> 00:37:09,885
- I'll tell you...
- What!

739
00:37:09,909 --> 00:37:12,551
I will tell you about the men
on my side of the family.

740
00:37:12,575 --> 00:37:15,094
My father schtooped
himself to death.

741
00:37:15,118 --> 00:37:16,135
You forgot how he died?

742
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:18,468
How could I forget, with
his 20-year-old secretary.

743
00:37:18,492 --> 00:37:19,468
- Exactly!
- Yeah!

744
00:37:19,492 --> 00:37:21,892
You know that schmuck would've
been better off if he was gay.

745
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:25,052
And his brother, my uncle
Moishe, 80 years old,

746
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,916
still the biggest womanizer
in all of Brooklyn.

747
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,802
And I wish you were a little bit
more like your uncle moishe.

748
00:37:29,826 --> 00:37:31,676
What are you talking about?
What?

749
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,737
Well, I don't want to hurt
your feelings, Marty,

750
00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:40,460
but I mean in the last few
months, you know, nothing, zippo.

751
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:43,027
You think I lost it, huh?

752
00:37:43,051 --> 00:37:46,235
No, I don't think you lost it.
I think it's resting.

753
00:37:46,259 --> 00:37:47,985
It's in semi-retirement.

754
00:37:48,009 --> 00:37:50,068
Semi-retirement?
Hold this.

755
00:37:50,092 --> 00:37:51,334
- You hold it.
- What are you doing?

756
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:53,558
You want to know about the
men on my side of the family?

757
00:37:53,582 --> 00:37:55,801
I'll tell you about the men
on my side of the family.

758
00:37:55,825 --> 00:37:58,276
This is the men on
my side of the family.

759
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,735
What is this?
A threat?

760
00:37:59,759 --> 00:38:01,485
Take it however
you want it.

761
00:38:01,509 --> 00:38:03,610
Whatever will start
your motor, honey.

762
00:38:03,634 --> 00:38:06,235
Okay, this is my
side of the family.

763
00:38:06,259 --> 00:38:10,651
You, get your ass up here.
Get up here.

764
00:38:10,675 --> 00:38:11,943
Should I call 911?

765
00:38:11,967 --> 00:38:14,610
Call whoever you want.
It's not gonna help you.

766
00:38:14,634 --> 00:38:17,443
All right, all right, all right.

767
00:38:17,467 --> 00:38:21,117
[laughing]

768
00:38:22,423 --> 00:38:24,526
If I had known this
was gonna happen,

769
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:27,091
I wish we'd found out
about Nelson sooner.

770
00:38:27,914 --> 00:38:32,204
[upbeat dance music]

771
00:38:33,425 --> 00:38:37,401
[moans and groans]

772
00:38:37,425 --> 00:38:40,610
There's not one gay bone
in my body, right?

773
00:38:40,634 --> 00:38:42,693
No, no, no more.
I want more.

774
00:38:42,717 --> 00:38:44,943
- What?
- I want more.

775
00:38:44,967 --> 00:38:48,443
In order to form an
opinion, I need more.

776
00:38:48,467 --> 00:38:51,592
[laughing]

777
00:38:53,176 --> 00:38:54,359
No, it's not
gonna work.

778
00:38:54,383 --> 00:38:55,703
Yes, sure, it will.
Sure, it will.

779
00:38:55,727 --> 00:38:57,276
- My arm.
- Move your arm.

780
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,526
Come here. Come here.

781
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:03,863
Alright. You wanted more.
You're getting more.

782
00:39:03,887 --> 00:39:06,053
[moaning]

783
00:39:09,342 --> 00:39:12,300
[moans]

784
00:39:12,842 --> 00:39:14,342
Oh, god!

785
00:39:15,331 --> 00:39:17,179
[elevator bell]

786
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,074
[Nudleman] Good
afternoon, Mr. Hirsch.

787
00:39:24,098 --> 00:39:25,352
Good afternoon.

788
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,144
Very colorful.

789
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:41,143
Glad you like it.

790
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:43,649
I didn't say I liked it.
I said it was colorful.

791
00:39:44,459 --> 00:39:46,257
These clothes are
what's in today.

792
00:39:46,834 --> 00:39:48,008
Are they?

793
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:50,929
That's terrific.

794
00:39:55,554 --> 00:39:57,189
[elevator dings]

795
00:40:10,323 --> 00:40:14,809
[elevator door rustling]

796
00:40:20,036 --> 00:40:21,245
Sorry.

797
00:40:26,084 --> 00:40:27,323
Sorry.

798
00:40:28,265 --> 00:40:29,827
[elevator dings]

799
00:40:33,459 --> 00:40:34,604
[grunt]

800
00:40:37,449 --> 00:40:40,965
[elevator door opens]

801
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,893
[Marty] Why do I have
to do this?

802
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:45,352
Because you're homophobic.

803
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,335
Why because I didn't
like Nudleman's shirt?

804
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:49,851
Come on, honey.
Forget Nudleman.

805
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:51,679
You have to go in
and face your fears

806
00:40:51,703 --> 00:40:54,185
or else you're never gonna be
able to handle any of this.

807
00:40:54,209 --> 00:40:56,394
[whining]

808
00:40:56,418 --> 00:40:57,935
- Go on.
- [sobbing]

809
00:40:57,959 --> 00:40:59,486
I love you.

810
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,075
If I'm not out of there in
ten minutes, call the police.

811
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:03,726
I promise.

812
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,998
All right.

813
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:06,650
Behave.

814
00:41:07,292 --> 00:41:12,042
[dance music]

815
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:24,409
The gentleman on the end
said the drink's on him.

816
00:41:26,042 --> 00:41:28,287
I don't want to be on him.

817
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:40,518
I don't live far
from here.

818
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:42,476
- What? Sorry?
- [chuckling]

819
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,995
Like, if you're looking
for an engagement ring,

820
00:41:44,019 --> 00:41:45,279
- I'm not your guy.
- Oh, no.

821
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:47,783
But if you want to make the best
of what's left of the night...

822
00:41:47,807 --> 00:41:52,018
No, no. I'm... no offense
but I'm not like you.

823
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:57,060
That's all right. Opposites
attract, and I dig older men.

824
00:41:57,084 --> 00:41:58,685
I am not that old.

825
00:41:58,709 --> 00:42:00,352
Oh, little sensitive?

826
00:42:00,376 --> 00:42:03,643
No. I'm not here for...

827
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:07,851
I'm actually here just
to do a little research.

828
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:10,518
Oh, well, sorry professor.

829
00:42:10,542 --> 00:42:12,394
Let me know if you
need a specimen.

830
00:42:12,418 --> 00:42:14,626
I'll be back to
check in on you.

831
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:16,190
Can hardly wait.

832
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,726
Oh, Jesus Christ.
I'm sorry.

833
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,726
It was so much better
in the old days

834
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,018
when courtship
was in fashion.

835
00:42:30,042 --> 00:42:32,582
Now, it's strictly
fast food.

836
00:42:33,575 --> 00:42:35,250
My name's Skip.

837
00:42:35,645 --> 00:42:37,851
Now, don't ask me
where it comes from

838
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:42,514
and it's not short for
anything, and neither am I.

839
00:42:44,086 --> 00:42:46,352
- What's your name?
- Uh, I'm Martin.

840
00:42:46,376 --> 00:42:47,810
Do you mind if
I call you Marty?

841
00:42:47,834 --> 00:42:50,631
Call me whatever
you want, Skippy.

842
00:42:50,655 --> 00:42:51,748
I'm not really...

843
00:42:51,772 --> 00:42:55,280
I wouldn't mind being
your bicycle seat.

844
00:43:00,251 --> 00:43:03,060
Look, I got to be
far away from you.

845
00:43:03,084 --> 00:43:04,453
Sorry.

846
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:08,750
[dance music]

847
00:43:36,084 --> 00:43:38,418
[cheers]

848
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:13,209
Martin?

849
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:15,851
Oh, my god.

850
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:18,060
- Martin Hirsch?
- I don't know who you are.

851
00:44:18,084 --> 00:44:20,084
Oh honey, I don't care if
you know the girl or not.

852
00:44:20,108 --> 00:44:21,251
You got to stop
peeing on me.

853
00:44:21,275 --> 00:44:22,768
I'm sorry.

854
00:44:23,807 --> 00:44:26,213
It's me, Martin.

855
00:44:27,118 --> 00:44:28,476
Martin.

856
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,143
Martin Hirsch.

857
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,296
I know you're in there.

858
00:44:32,823 --> 00:44:34,990
Martin, it's me, Nudleman.

859
00:44:38,834 --> 00:44:40,723
Well, let's just leave 'em.

860
00:44:41,418 --> 00:44:43,185
Ooh.

861
00:44:43,209 --> 00:44:44,533
Careful.

862
00:44:51,917 --> 00:44:54,959
Oh, Jesus Christ.

863
00:44:56,875 --> 00:44:58,423
Shit.

864
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,910
[singing]
It's raining men, hallelujah...

865
00:45:05,934 --> 00:45:07,594
- Drive, fast.
- Honey?

866
00:45:07,618 --> 00:45:08,738
- Just go.
- What's going on?

867
00:45:08,762 --> 00:45:10,635
Don't even ask.
Just go, go.

868
00:45:10,659 --> 00:45:13,051
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- Okay, okay. Relax.

869
00:45:13,075 --> 00:45:14,435
Are you kidding me
with that music?

870
00:45:14,459 --> 00:45:15,968
Has the whole world gone gay?

871
00:45:15,992 --> 00:45:17,260
What happened in there?

872
00:45:17,284 --> 00:45:20,427
- Shirley, I saw Max in there.
- You saw Max in there?

873
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:22,510
- These two guys came onto me.
- Wait a sec. What?

874
00:45:22,534 --> 00:45:24,156
- Incredibly embarrassing.
- Just wait a second.

875
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,518
- Get back to the Max part.
- Well, I saw him in there.

876
00:45:26,542 --> 00:45:27,843
- He's there.
- Max? My brother?

877
00:45:27,867 --> 00:45:29,635
- Yeah.
- He's been married for 20 years.

878
00:45:29,659 --> 00:45:31,779
A lot of married guys go
into bars like that, Shirley.

879
00:45:31,803 --> 00:45:32,705
They call them ACDC.

880
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:34,510
Max ACDC.
Don't be ridiculous.

881
00:45:34,534 --> 00:45:36,854
Well, what can I tell ya.
He's in there and so is Nudleman.

882
00:45:36,878 --> 00:45:39,635
- Nudleman? From the office?
- Yes. In a dress.

883
00:45:39,659 --> 00:45:41,676
- Oh my god!
- And he saw me.

884
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,176
Everybody's in there?
What about Nelson?

885
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,260
And the decorator?

886
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,218
No, Nelson is nothing
like those guys.

887
00:45:47,242 --> 00:45:48,635
He's completely different.

888
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:51,568
Nelson's problem is just...
He doesn't understand women

889
00:45:51,592 --> 00:45:54,318
or maybe he's never found a
woman that understands him.

890
00:45:54,342 --> 00:45:56,943
Women just don't
understand men altogether.

891
00:45:56,967 --> 00:45:58,887
It's probably why this happens
to so many of 'em.

892
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:01,193
What? You are making
no sense to me at all.

893
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:03,684
Why are there so many gay guys? You
should've seen that place, Shirley.

894
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:06,093
It was completely packed,
and I think it's because...

895
00:46:06,117 --> 00:46:07,957
I don't know it's because
of the way treat men.

896
00:46:07,981 --> 00:46:09,040
- What?
- Yeah.

897
00:46:09,064 --> 00:46:12,519
That is the most insane thing
I've ever heard you say.

898
00:46:12,543 --> 00:46:15,427
You're making me very,
very upset and angry.

899
00:46:15,451 --> 00:46:17,331
Well, maybe I should've
had a drink with Skippy.

900
00:46:17,355 --> 00:46:18,468
Maybe you should have.

901
00:46:18,492 --> 00:46:19,901
Who's Skippy?

902
00:46:19,925 --> 00:46:21,318
Skippy's the guy
that came onto me.

903
00:46:21,342 --> 00:46:23,402
- What? Oh my god.
- You told me to go in there.

904
00:46:23,426 --> 00:46:24,901
- And face my fears, right?
- Yeah.

905
00:46:24,925 --> 00:46:26,245
So I did, and guess
what happened?

906
00:46:26,269 --> 00:46:28,360
- What happened?
- It was kind of exciting.

907
00:46:28,384 --> 00:46:29,943
- What?
- It was a little bit...

908
00:46:29,967 --> 00:46:31,818
You know, it's forbidden
and kind of enticing?

909
00:46:31,842 --> 00:46:33,694
Martin, Martin.
Stop it!

910
00:46:33,718 --> 00:46:35,402
Ow. It was uncomfortable and weird,

911
00:46:35,426 --> 00:46:36,527
but it was also erotic.

912
00:46:36,551 --> 00:46:37,694
- Erotic?
- Yeah.

913
00:46:37,718 --> 00:46:39,859
- Extreme.
- You're making me sick.

914
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:41,694
- No, no, no.
- Maybe I'm gay.

915
00:46:41,718 --> 00:46:43,235
- Maybe you are.
- Maybe I am.

916
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,443
- Maybe you are.
- The whole world is gay.

917
00:46:45,467 --> 00:46:47,151
Oh my, god is gay.

918
00:46:47,175 --> 00:46:50,883
[singing] I'm a gay man.
I'm a gay man. I'm gay until I die.

919
00:46:54,882 --> 00:46:59,652
[singing] I'm a gay man.
I'll be gay until I die.

920
00:46:59,676 --> 00:47:00,735
Marty.

921
00:47:00,759 --> 00:47:04,985
I am lost and gone forever
because I'm gay until I die.

922
00:47:05,009 --> 00:47:05,883
Marty.

923
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:08,735
- I'm a gay man. I'm a gay man.
- What are you doing?

924
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:10,527
What? Being gay.

925
00:47:10,551 --> 00:47:12,517
Marty, knock it off.
You're gonna make me puke.

926
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:14,710
God, help us.

927
00:47:14,734 --> 00:47:16,918
- You're a mashugana.
- What should we do?

928
00:47:16,942 --> 00:47:18,627
You know what?
I can't deal with this.

929
00:47:18,651 --> 00:47:21,168
- I'm going in the house.
- Give us a sign.

930
00:47:21,192 --> 00:47:22,460
Anything.

931
00:47:22,484 --> 00:47:23,918
[bird flying by]

932
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:27,350
Thank you, God.

933
00:47:27,374 --> 00:47:29,001
[laughs]

934
00:47:29,025 --> 00:47:32,001
Our son's life has
become one big joke to you.

935
00:47:32,025 --> 00:47:33,700
No, no, just...

936
00:47:35,942 --> 00:47:37,210
As far as you're
concerned,

937
00:47:37,234 --> 00:47:39,418
this is all happening
to somebody else,

938
00:47:39,442 --> 00:47:42,585
and the only way you can deal
with it is to make fun of it.

939
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:43,835
I'm not. I'm not.

940
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:46,192
You just can't face it.

941
00:47:46,983 --> 00:47:48,335
You know why it's
happening to us?

942
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:49,359
Why?

943
00:47:49,383 --> 00:47:51,647
In case you forgot, whatever
happens to your children

944
00:47:51,671 --> 00:47:53,085
happens to you.

945
00:47:53,109 --> 00:47:54,869
Now, listen. All right,
it's happening to me.

946
00:47:54,893 --> 00:47:55,896
It's happening to you,

947
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,913
and what do you think
we can do about it, huh?

948
00:47:58,651 --> 00:48:03,918
First, we can try and find out
who our son really is

949
00:48:03,942 --> 00:48:08,376
and how he lives his life
and who his friends are,

950
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,794
and we have to go
into his world.

951
00:48:10,818 --> 00:48:13,126
Marty, we have to go
into his world

952
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:16,876
and try and understand it so
we can become a family again.

953
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,959
Yeah, I went into
his world today,

954
00:48:18,983 --> 00:48:21,043
and I think I've had
enough for a lifetime.

955
00:48:21,067 --> 00:48:23,210
- Marty?
- What?

956
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:25,872
If our son is really gay,

957
00:48:26,442 --> 00:48:28,502
we have to learn
to live with it.

958
00:48:28,526 --> 00:48:29,752
I know.

959
00:48:29,776 --> 00:48:31,376
Because he is our son.

960
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,710
I know.

961
00:48:32,734 --> 00:48:34,128
I know.

962
00:48:34,775 --> 00:48:36,559
[melancholic music]

963
00:48:42,055 --> 00:48:43,722
[elevator bell]

964
00:48:44,293 --> 00:48:48,121
[elevator door rustling]

965
00:49:00,677 --> 00:49:02,236
I didn't know.

966
00:49:04,173 --> 00:49:05,362
What?

967
00:49:05,923 --> 00:49:08,555
You're so sneaky.
You little devil, you.

968
00:49:15,184 --> 00:49:16,267
[sighs]

969
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:19,660
Martin?

970
00:49:19,684 --> 00:49:21,318
Yeah? Hi.

971
00:49:21,342 --> 00:49:25,493
Um, Martin, I'd like you
to meet Emmitt Bernstein.

972
00:49:25,517 --> 00:49:28,076
He is the secretary for
an organization called

973
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,493
the national society
for gay people.

974
00:49:30,517 --> 00:49:31,635
The what?
The what society?

975
00:49:31,659 --> 00:49:34,326
The national society
for gay people.

976
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:36,383
- May I?
- Uh, yeah.

977
00:49:37,143 --> 00:49:40,243
It's a gay organization.
We fight for our rights.

978
00:49:40,267 --> 00:49:41,743
We print brochures.

979
00:49:41,767 --> 00:49:43,410
We even publish
our own newspaper.

980
00:49:43,434 --> 00:49:44,831
Uh-huh.

981
00:49:44,855 --> 00:49:45,971
Hello.

982
00:49:46,393 --> 00:49:47,452
We do this.

983
00:49:47,476 --> 00:49:48,737
There ya go.

984
00:49:49,225 --> 00:49:51,493
I'm Emmit's friend,
Lance Smith.

985
00:49:51,517 --> 00:49:54,082
I'm a member of the committee,
and chief editor of our paper,

986
00:49:54,106 --> 00:49:55,226
the gayzette.

987
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:58,118
- The what?
- The gayzette.

988
00:49:58,142 --> 00:49:59,827
- Gay... Gayzette.
- Gayzette.

989
00:49:59,851 --> 00:50:00,855
That's cute.

990
00:50:00,879 --> 00:50:05,702
Yeah, so nice to meet you.
I'm Martin Hirsch.

991
00:50:05,726 --> 00:50:08,326
The pleasure's all mine, Marty.
May I call you Marty?

992
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:10,493
No, can I call you Lancy?

993
00:50:10,517 --> 00:50:12,243
[whispering] Stop.

994
00:50:12,267 --> 00:50:15,118
This is Margaret who obviously
knew you were coming.

995
00:50:15,142 --> 00:50:16,326
Hi fellas.

996
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:17,509
Okay, okay.

997
00:50:17,533 --> 00:50:19,789
So, you two are...

998
00:50:22,434 --> 00:50:24,415
He's very young for an
editor wouldn't you say?

999
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:26,108
- And very handsome.
- Thank you.

1000
00:50:26,132 --> 00:50:28,285
- Thank you both very much.
- And such a cute face.

1001
00:50:28,309 --> 00:50:30,246
He's actually 32.

1002
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:31,660
He looks 18.

1003
00:50:31,684 --> 00:50:33,743
And we just celebrated
his birthday yesterday.

1004
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:35,035
Congratulations.

1005
00:50:35,059 --> 00:50:37,201
Because he looks
barely legal.

1006
00:50:37,225 --> 00:50:39,326
Like I said, just happy birthday.

1007
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:40,952
I like this man.
Thank you.

1008
00:50:40,976 --> 00:50:44,326
So these gentlemen have come
here to talk to us today

1009
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:50,576
- about what it's like to be...
- Okay, I see what you... fine.

1010
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,704
Why don't you tell us
what it's like to be...

1011
00:50:53,434 --> 00:50:55,368
Go ahead talk to us about
what it's like to be...

1012
00:50:55,392 --> 00:50:57,785
You can say it. Gay.

1013
00:50:57,809 --> 00:51:00,868
Yeah, that's the word I was
desperately searching for.

1014
00:51:00,892 --> 00:51:02,952
- They know about Nelson.
- Oh, I'm thrilled.

1015
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:05,243
So, you both know
that your son is gay?

1016
00:51:05,267 --> 00:51:06,243
Yeah.

1017
00:51:06,267 --> 00:51:07,667
And it comes as a
bit of a surprise.

1018
00:51:07,691 --> 00:51:08,743
A little bit.

1019
00:51:08,767 --> 00:51:10,087
It takes a little
getting used to.

1020
00:51:10,111 --> 00:51:10,827
Kind of.

1021
00:51:10,851 --> 00:51:12,371
I remember my parents
when I told them.

1022
00:51:12,395 --> 00:51:13,771
- They were sick.
- I can imagine.

1023
00:51:13,795 --> 00:51:16,243
I mean sick.
It was as if someone had died.

1024
00:51:16,267 --> 00:51:18,368
Died. I know
that feeling.

1025
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:22,994
Well, we thought it would
be a good idea to find out,

1026
00:51:23,018 --> 00:51:26,743
what we should expect, what
happens between, you know...?

1027
00:51:26,767 --> 00:51:28,785
[doorbell]

1028
00:51:28,809 --> 00:51:32,368
Margaret, tell
Andrea no kids tonight.

1029
00:51:32,392 --> 00:51:35,250
- We don't want to be disturbed.
- Don't want to be disturbed.

1030
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:37,410
Okay, so this is what
you wanted to do, fine.

1031
00:51:37,434 --> 00:51:38,725
You want to know how we feel?

1032
00:51:38,749 --> 00:51:40,118
We're just gonna lay
our cards on the table.

1033
00:51:40,142 --> 00:51:41,370
- We feel terrible.
- Marty.

1034
00:51:41,394 --> 00:51:43,274
- We feel shocked. Disappointed.
- No, we don't.

1035
00:51:43,298 --> 00:51:44,978
If she was gonna be
really honest with you,

1036
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:47,099
she would tell you deep
down inside she's horrified.

1037
00:51:47,123 --> 00:51:47,868
I'm not horrified.

1038
00:51:47,892 --> 00:51:49,282
This is a nightmare
for our family.

1039
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:50,905
It's a temporary nightmare.

1040
00:51:50,929 --> 00:51:54,410
I mean, we really don't even
know if Nelson is really...

1041
00:51:54,434 --> 00:51:55,910
- Gay, Mrs. Hirsch.
- Yes.

1042
00:51:55,934 --> 00:51:57,785
Excuse me.
You have a guest.

1043
00:51:58,107 --> 00:51:59,785
Who? Oh, my God.

1044
00:51:59,809 --> 00:52:02,576
Oh, my God!
It's God.

1045
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,159
[Moishe] I was in the neighborhood.
Am I interrupting?

1046
00:52:05,183 --> 00:52:06,952
No, it's perfect.

1047
00:52:06,976 --> 00:52:08,368
You couldn't have
come at a better time.

1048
00:52:08,392 --> 00:52:09,992
- No, I couldn't be happier.
- I'm tired.

1049
00:52:10,016 --> 00:52:11,536
Why? What's the matter?
Welcome him in.

1050
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,243
Uncle Moishe, come sit right
here between Emmitt and Lancy,

1051
00:52:14,267 --> 00:52:17,743
right here who are
Shirley's friends, by the way.

1052
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:19,035
She's the one
that invited them.

1053
00:52:19,059 --> 00:52:20,702
Not friends, they're associates.

1054
00:52:20,726 --> 00:52:22,785
This is my uncle
Moishe, he's my boss.

1055
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:24,076
I hope you're happy now.

1056
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,850
These two...
They belong to a gay club.

1057
00:52:28,985 --> 00:52:32,111
A gay club? See?
He has no idea.

1058
00:52:32,135 --> 00:52:34,255
They're married, uncle Moishe,
so you don't have to...

1059
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:36,576
Uh, Margaret, could you
bring me a vodka, please?

1060
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,727
Bring her a triple.

1061
00:52:37,751 --> 00:52:40,743
So, Mr. Hirsch, what do you
think about sex education

1062
00:52:40,767 --> 00:52:42,035
in the public schools.

1063
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:43,243
[laughing]

1064
00:52:43,267 --> 00:52:44,952
Sex education?

1065
00:52:44,976 --> 00:52:46,696
I've always wanted to
ask him that question.

1066
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,410
My feeling is that girls should
be encouraged to stay virgins

1067
00:52:50,434 --> 00:52:53,201
until they're married.
Like in the old days.

1068
00:52:53,225 --> 00:52:54,425
I couldn't agree
with you more.

1069
00:52:54,449 --> 00:52:55,791
But what about boys?

1070
00:52:55,815 --> 00:52:57,118
Do you encourage
masturbation?

1071
00:52:57,142 --> 00:53:00,796
No, no. There's other ways
to learn about sex.

1072
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,785
Boys should go
to whore houses.

1073
00:53:02,809 --> 00:53:04,731
Oh, my god.
Moishe.

1074
00:53:04,755 --> 00:53:06,827
What? You guys didn't do
it when you were young?

1075
00:53:06,851 --> 00:53:07,827
Not me.

1076
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,201
I don't think that
they did, uncle Moishe.

1077
00:53:09,225 --> 00:53:10,618
They didn't go to
a whore house.

1078
00:53:10,642 --> 00:53:11,982
Martin, do you have a problem?

1079
00:53:12,006 --> 00:53:15,307
Personally, I think
hookers are a bit disgusting.

1080
00:53:15,331 --> 00:53:18,105
There is nothing healthier
than a healthy hooker

1081
00:53:18,129 --> 00:53:20,429
for a healthy sex lifestyle.

1082
00:53:21,207 --> 00:53:22,813
Don't you think so, Martin?

1083
00:53:24,142 --> 00:53:26,780
I'm just doing my best to
pretend I'm on another planet.

1084
00:53:26,804 --> 00:53:28,785
I'm actually worried
about Nelson, okay?

1085
00:53:28,809 --> 00:53:32,657
Nelson. Now, there's
a healthy kid

1086
00:53:32,681 --> 00:53:35,118
and nothing wrong with
Nelson's sex education.

1087
00:53:35,142 --> 00:53:36,535
Right.

1088
00:53:37,556 --> 00:53:39,223
[doorbell]

1089
00:53:41,667 --> 00:53:43,785
[Angelo] Hello.

1090
00:53:43,809 --> 00:53:45,702
Please come in.

1091
00:53:46,279 --> 00:53:48,118
Thank you.

1092
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:49,201
For you.

1093
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:51,040
Thank you so much.
I love orchids.

1094
00:53:51,064 --> 00:53:52,118
I'm glad.

1095
00:53:52,142 --> 00:53:53,445
Almost as much
as I love Nelson.

1096
00:53:53,469 --> 00:53:55,339
You know what?
Let me take these from you.

1097
00:53:55,855 --> 00:53:57,394
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

1098
00:53:57,418 --> 00:54:00,189
Yes. There you go.
The apartment looks great.

1099
00:54:00,213 --> 00:54:02,735
Please come in.
Make yourselves at home.

1100
00:54:02,759 --> 00:54:05,842
Nelly, your parents are here.

1101
00:54:08,425 --> 00:54:12,443
Wow. Wow. My table
never looks this nice.

1102
00:54:12,467 --> 00:54:14,068
Yeah.

1103
00:54:14,092 --> 00:54:15,967
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

1104
00:54:19,218 --> 00:54:21,359
Oh, well make
yourselves comfortable.

1105
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:22,735
What are you drinking?

1106
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,068
Oh, I'll wait
'til dinner.

1107
00:54:24,092 --> 00:54:25,332
I'll have some wine
with dinner.

1108
00:54:25,356 --> 00:54:26,735
I'll have a double scotch, okay.

1109
00:54:26,759 --> 00:54:27,818
Marty?

1110
00:54:27,842 --> 00:54:30,110
Uh, wine with dinner.

1111
00:54:30,134 --> 00:54:31,651
I should warn you.

1112
00:54:31,675 --> 00:54:33,943
I tried to cook with as
little salt as possible.

1113
00:54:33,967 --> 00:54:36,443
That's very smart
of you, Angelo.

1114
00:54:36,467 --> 00:54:40,526
- Isn't it, Marty?
- What? It's brilliant.

1115
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:42,194
Do you use
a salt substitute?

1116
00:54:42,218 --> 00:54:43,359
No, I don't.

1117
00:54:43,383 --> 00:54:45,735
I kind of find it leaves a
weird aftertaste in my mouth.

1118
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,860
Yeah, I know.

1119
00:54:46,884 --> 00:54:49,235
- Would you like?
- I'll take one.

1120
00:54:49,259 --> 00:54:50,735
Go ahead, Marty.
Have a...

1121
00:54:50,759 --> 00:54:52,610
Yeah, I'm gonna have one
a little bit later.

1122
00:54:52,634 --> 00:54:54,884
- No, have one.
- I'll have one a little later.

1123
00:54:56,051 --> 00:54:58,985
Mmm. Delicious.

1124
00:54:59,009 --> 00:55:00,649
Well, I have to tell you
how long it takes

1125
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:02,068
to get these catape just right.

1126
00:55:02,092 --> 00:55:04,651
For me, literally it takes me
just as long to pick out

1127
00:55:04,675 --> 00:55:06,884
a cute little outfit
for the gym.

1128
00:55:08,134 --> 00:55:09,717
I hated it.

1129
00:55:10,926 --> 00:55:12,568
Did you hear that
thing about the gym?

1130
00:55:12,592 --> 00:55:13,860
Marty, yes I did.

1131
00:55:13,884 --> 00:55:15,985
Behave yourself,
would you, please?

1132
00:55:16,009 --> 00:55:17,943
I didn't put a
catape in my purse.

1133
00:55:17,967 --> 00:55:19,443
Oh, stop it.

1134
00:55:19,467 --> 00:55:22,194
[soft music]

1135
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:24,194
- More?
- Oh, no thank you.

1136
00:55:24,218 --> 00:55:25,538
- Dad?
- I wouldn't mind a refill.

1137
00:55:25,562 --> 00:55:27,401
He's gonna have a
cup of coffee.

1138
00:55:27,425 --> 00:55:28,926
Thank you.

1139
00:55:29,581 --> 00:55:30,956
[clears throat]

1140
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:37,805
Thanks.

1141
00:55:43,259 --> 00:55:44,860
Anyone like any
after dinner drinks?

1142
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:46,027
No, thank you.

1143
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,634
Okay.

1144
00:55:48,967 --> 00:55:50,943
Angelo, it was
a terrific meal.

1145
00:55:50,967 --> 00:55:52,806
Oh, thank you.

1146
00:55:53,759 --> 00:55:55,878
It was very good.
Thank you.

1147
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:57,936
[Angelo] Thank you.

1148
00:55:58,703 --> 00:55:59,850
Guys,

1149
00:56:02,218 --> 00:56:03,276
how can
I explain to you

1150
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,401
why I am the way I am any
better than you can explain

1151
00:56:06,425 --> 00:56:08,110
why you are
the way you are?

1152
00:56:08,134 --> 00:56:10,014
Oh, I think I can explain
why I am the way I am.

1153
00:56:10,038 --> 00:56:12,518
Marty, Marty.
Shoosh, please.

1154
00:56:12,542 --> 00:56:15,190
Look, what you need
to understand is

1155
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,660
that this doesn't have
anything to do with you.

1156
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,810
I am who I am.

1157
00:56:20,834 --> 00:56:22,601
I've been this way ever since
I can remember,

1158
00:56:22,625 --> 00:56:25,227
probably since I was born.

1159
00:56:25,251 --> 00:56:26,601
We understand.

1160
00:56:26,625 --> 00:56:27,976
I don't think
I understand.

1161
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,810
Marty, please, shush.
Not now.

1162
00:56:30,834 --> 00:56:33,143
What can I say to you that you
haven't already read about

1163
00:56:33,167 --> 00:56:36,042
or heard or seen?

1164
00:56:38,709 --> 00:56:40,149
I'm gay.

1165
00:56:40,917 --> 00:56:44,310
I don't steal.
I don't do drugs.

1166
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:47,060
I don't kill.
I'm just gay.

1167
00:56:47,084 --> 00:56:49,935
I don't think that I should have
to be dishonest to myself

1168
00:56:49,959 --> 00:56:52,542
just so that you two
can be comfortable.

1169
00:56:53,601 --> 00:56:59,810
I want to be true to myself just
like Angelo is true to himself.

1170
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:01,310
Can I say how I feel?

1171
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:02,893
Not now.
This is not the time.

1172
00:57:02,917 --> 00:57:05,143
No, mom.
This is the time.

1173
00:57:05,167 --> 00:57:06,768
Shush.

1174
00:57:06,792 --> 00:57:09,060
Mom, let him say
what he has to say.

1175
00:57:09,084 --> 00:57:11,518
Angelo, could I have a word
alone with my son, please?

1176
00:57:11,542 --> 00:57:14,042
No, no.
Sit down, Angelo.

1177
00:57:15,275 --> 00:57:19,268
Mom, I want you to accept
Angelo as part of the family.

1178
00:57:19,292 --> 00:57:21,418
That's how I feel about him.

1179
00:57:22,376 --> 00:57:24,564
Look, I have a suggestion.

1180
00:57:25,376 --> 00:57:28,994
Take it slow
because you never know.

1181
00:57:29,511 --> 00:57:34,726
[scoffs] Mom, I know.

1182
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,542
We know.

1183
00:57:38,042 --> 00:57:39,379
How do you know?

1184
00:57:39,403 --> 00:57:41,685
You've just begun to live.

1185
00:57:41,709 --> 00:57:43,976
I mean, how do
you know about we?

1186
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,435
How do you know
about you?

1187
00:57:46,459 --> 00:57:49,801
Honey, it's too soon.

1188
00:57:50,916 --> 00:57:52,869
Just think about it.

1189
00:57:52,893 --> 00:57:55,559
Do I have to spell
this out for you?

1190
00:57:55,583 --> 00:57:58,211
Angelo's not the first one.

1191
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:01,132
[Marty] There's been
more of them?

1192
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,237
Huh? Yeah.

1193
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,644
Marty?

1194
00:58:08,667 --> 00:58:10,269
Marty, are you
all right?

1195
00:58:11,418 --> 00:58:14,476
Listen, Nelson, why don't
you and me take a ride, okay?

1196
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,500
Just father and son.
Is that okay with you, Angelo?

1197
00:58:16,524 --> 00:58:18,060
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?

1198
00:58:18,084 --> 00:58:20,435
I'm just gonna talk alone to
my son. Is that okay with you?

1199
00:58:20,459 --> 00:58:22,435
No. It's not all right with me.

1200
00:58:22,459 --> 00:58:25,185
It's too bad because
I'm gonna do it anyway.

1201
00:58:25,209 --> 00:58:26,689
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

1202
00:58:26,713 --> 00:58:29,102
I'm just gonna go have a
man to man talk with my son.

1203
00:58:29,126 --> 00:58:31,334
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

1204
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,875
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

1205
00:58:38,209 --> 00:58:39,834
Do you have any vodka?

1206
00:58:41,418 --> 00:58:45,334
[baseball game on TV]

1207
00:58:52,834 --> 00:58:55,143
- Dad?
- Yeah.

1208
00:58:55,167 --> 00:58:57,352
I thought you wanted to have
a man to man conversation.

1209
00:58:57,376 --> 00:58:59,526
I can barely hear
myself think.

1210
00:59:00,376 --> 00:59:01,935
You love this place.
This is our place.

1211
00:59:01,959 --> 00:59:03,185
We always used
to come here.

1212
00:59:03,209 --> 00:59:05,726
It's the place you and me
were always on the same page.

1213
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:09,726
Well, yeah, we were on the same
page but of two different books.

1214
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,038
What?

1215
00:59:11,462 --> 00:59:14,669
You always liked the game,
and I always liked the players.

1216
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:17,132
[sighs]

1217
00:59:17,709 --> 00:59:19,167
Thanks.

1218
00:59:25,959 --> 00:59:28,018
You want your mom and I

1219
00:59:28,042 --> 00:59:30,851
to accept this
just like that, right?

1220
00:59:30,875 --> 00:59:33,102
Obviously, you didn't
accept it just like that

1221
00:59:33,126 --> 00:59:34,925
or you would've come
to us a lot earlier.

1222
00:59:38,907 --> 00:59:42,643
Nelson, maybe if you'd
come to me sooner

1223
00:59:42,667 --> 00:59:45,342
and together you and I
could've fixed this.

1224
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:49,726
Dad, that's exactly why I
didn't come to you earlier.

1225
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:52,156
There's nothing to fix.
I'm not broken.

1226
00:59:58,125 --> 01:00:00,501
You know some of
those guys are gay?

1227
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:04,709
Only thing that's broken about
them is they can't come out.

1228
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:09,060
[Announcer on TV] Here's the pass.
Nice catch. Can he spin? Yes he can.

1229
01:00:09,084 --> 01:00:10,935
He's loose, he may go.

1230
01:00:10,959 --> 01:00:14,084
[crowd reactions and applause]

1231
01:00:16,042 --> 01:00:18,667
Forty eight yard
touchdown pass...

1232
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,768
Marty, why do we
have to do this?

1233
01:00:21,792 --> 01:00:24,810
They said this guy is an expert.
He's the top of his field.

1234
01:00:24,834 --> 01:00:27,685
I think his wisdom
and his insight

1235
01:00:27,709 --> 01:00:30,502
will help us turn this
whole thing around.

1236
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:32,127
All right.

1237
01:00:32,151 --> 01:00:33,569
I'll give it a try.

1238
01:00:34,542 --> 01:00:36,810
[Doctor] A child is born.

1239
01:00:36,834 --> 01:00:39,796
The mother is caring, warm.

1240
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:44,102
She breastfeeds the baby
maybe four, five months.

1241
01:00:44,126 --> 01:00:47,060
She gives the child
love and serenity,

1242
01:00:47,084 --> 01:00:49,395
everything that
the child needs.

1243
01:00:49,419 --> 01:00:53,552
Suddenly, there's a change
in the baby's life.

1244
01:00:53,576 --> 01:00:57,926
The mother wants to live
again, become productive.

1245
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:02,594
She no longer has the time
that she used to for the boy.

1246
01:01:02,618 --> 01:01:04,343
The little boy is at a loss.

1247
01:01:04,367 --> 01:01:07,093
Gone is the total love
and security

1248
01:01:07,117 --> 01:01:08,968
that he's been accustomed to.

1249
01:01:08,992 --> 01:01:11,885
The mother is no longer
there like she was.

1250
01:01:11,909 --> 01:01:15,676
So, the boy turns to the father.

1251
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:18,801
With him, he finds
the love he lost.

1252
01:01:18,825 --> 01:01:23,385
The boy falls in love
with his father.

1253
01:01:23,409 --> 01:01:26,176
The boy grows up
and the boy remembers

1254
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:30,867
it was with another man where
he found this contentment.

1255
01:01:32,742 --> 01:01:34,235
I'm sorry.

1256
01:01:34,669 --> 01:01:36,093
[chuckles ironically]

1257
01:01:36,117 --> 01:01:38,718
Well doctor, if you ever
decide to go back to med school,

1258
01:01:38,742 --> 01:01:40,543
I'll pay for it.

1259
01:01:41,316 --> 01:01:44,510
Well, this is just one
theory we could apply.

1260
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:47,010
I see, but you really
don't know for sure.

1261
01:01:47,034 --> 01:01:48,552
Nobody does.

1262
01:01:48,576 --> 01:01:50,343
What about breastfeeding?

1263
01:01:50,367 --> 01:01:53,759
I breastfed my son
until he was about three.

1264
01:01:53,783 --> 01:01:56,326
- Three months?
- No three years.

1265
01:01:58,075 --> 01:01:59,075
What?

1266
01:01:59,867 --> 01:02:01,302
What?

1267
01:02:01,326 --> 01:02:04,801
Well, there is evidence that
says excessive breastfeeding

1268
01:02:04,825 --> 01:02:07,135
can bind a boy so completely

1269
01:02:07,159 --> 01:02:10,626
that he can't make a normal
relationship with another woman.

1270
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:13,010
Yeah, my mother did say you were
a little excessive with him

1271
01:02:13,034 --> 01:02:14,051
when he was young.

1272
01:02:14,075 --> 01:02:16,010
Your mother said that
because she is your mother.

1273
01:02:16,034 --> 01:02:17,093
Okay.

1274
01:02:17,117 --> 01:02:18,510
This is very
interesting, doctor.

1275
01:02:18,534 --> 01:02:20,510
Are you telling me
that there's a possibility

1276
01:02:20,534 --> 01:02:24,341
that I may be responsible
for turning my son gay?

1277
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:26,093
Well...

1278
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:27,302
What?

1279
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:29,260
Oh, Dr. Freud, who the hell
do you think you are,

1280
01:02:29,284 --> 01:02:30,926
you stupid little prick?

1281
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:34,427
- Okay, Shirley, Shirley.
- Oh no, Mr. Penis envy here.

1282
01:02:34,451 --> 01:02:36,302
How do you know what a
mother's love for her son is?

1283
01:02:36,326 --> 01:02:38,051
- Our time might be up.
- You have another ten minutes.

1284
01:02:38,075 --> 01:02:39,515
I ought to have
your license revoked.

1285
01:02:39,539 --> 01:02:40,343
Are you sure?

1286
01:02:40,367 --> 01:02:42,167
Because she's just
gonna keep going like this.

1287
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:43,385
You know what I gave my son?

1288
01:02:43,409 --> 01:02:44,926
I've given my son everything.

1289
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:47,190
- Just write him a check.
- I've loved him and loved him.

1290
01:02:47,214 --> 01:02:48,218
You know what?

1291
01:02:48,242 --> 01:02:50,343
I bet you never even
slept with a woman.

1292
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,968
You probably don't
even have a dick.

1293
01:02:51,992 --> 01:02:53,552
- There ya go.
- I'll send you the bill.

1294
01:02:53,576 --> 01:02:55,093
- Good idea. Sure.
- I'm out of here.

1295
01:02:55,117 --> 01:02:56,093
I'm coming.

1296
01:02:56,117 --> 01:02:57,260
Stupid piece of shit.

1297
01:02:57,284 --> 01:02:58,676
Nice talking to you.

1298
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:01,700
[soft music]

1299
01:03:03,618 --> 01:03:05,468
I'm here to see Martin Hirsch.

1300
01:03:05,492 --> 01:03:07,843
- Martin Hirsch?
- Yes.

1301
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:09,676
Second door
on your right.

1302
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,783
Okay. Thank you.

1303
01:03:23,618 --> 01:03:25,385
Oh, hi.
Come on in.

1304
01:03:25,409 --> 01:03:27,950
- Hi.
- Hi. Come on in.

1305
01:03:31,492 --> 01:03:35,051
Thank you, Sybil for coming.
Is it okay if I call ya Sybil?

1306
01:03:35,075 --> 01:03:37,176
- Of course.
- Call me Marty.

1307
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,718
Okay, Marty.

1308
01:03:38,742 --> 01:03:41,885
Do you want to take off... make
yourself, take something off.

1309
01:03:41,909 --> 01:03:44,759
Oh yeah. Sure.

1310
01:03:44,783 --> 01:03:47,427
Oh, by the way, your wife
is so sweet and lovely.

1311
01:03:47,451 --> 01:03:48,926
Thank you for saying so.

1312
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:51,718
And kind, yeah, and so
attractive and sexy.

1313
01:03:51,742 --> 01:03:53,676
Yeah, she's a force
of nature.

1314
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:54,926
Kind of like
a hurricane.

1315
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:56,135
[laughing]

1316
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:58,039
- Please sit down.
- Oh, sure, sure, sure, sure.

1317
01:03:58,063 --> 01:03:59,385
Can I get you anything?

1318
01:03:59,409 --> 01:04:01,718
- Oh, no thanks, I'm fine.
- You're fine?

1319
01:04:01,742 --> 01:04:06,010
So you must be wondering
why I asked you to come?

1320
01:04:06,034 --> 01:04:07,260
Yeah.

1321
01:04:07,284 --> 01:04:09,609
Um, I'm trying to figure
out exactly how to put this.

1322
01:04:09,633 --> 01:04:12,383
Maybe I should just
come out and say...

1323
01:04:14,409 --> 01:04:16,135
Just having a little
trouble figuring out

1324
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:19,618
exactly what
I'm gonna say.

1325
01:04:23,742 --> 01:04:25,742
Maybe I should just come
right out and just say it.

1326
01:04:25,766 --> 01:04:28,884
Yeah, just say it. [chuckles]

1327
01:04:28,908 --> 01:04:30,968
Would it be possible,
do you think,

1328
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:33,825
for you and my son,
Nelson, to...

1329
01:04:36,704 --> 01:04:42,219
It would be a really great thing
if you and my son could...

1330
01:04:43,284 --> 01:04:45,510
If you and he somehow...?

1331
01:04:45,534 --> 01:04:47,292
You want me
to screw Nelson?

1332
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:49,176
[laughs]
Yeah.

1333
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,464
I know how it sounds.

1334
01:04:50,488 --> 01:04:55,293
Um, it's just not
gonna happen.

1335
01:04:55,317 --> 01:04:56,959
- No?
- No.

1336
01:04:56,983 --> 01:04:58,959
He's a very good looking boy,
don't ya think?

1337
01:04:58,983 --> 01:05:03,752
Oh yeah, he's very
handsome and charming.

1338
01:05:03,776 --> 01:05:05,526
And...

1339
01:05:06,183 --> 01:05:09,161
[upbeat music]

1340
01:05:34,643 --> 01:05:36,226
[cork popping]

1341
01:05:53,734 --> 01:05:55,692
[Marty] And?

1342
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,251
Gay.

1343
01:05:58,275 --> 01:05:59,752
Yeah. There is that.

1344
01:05:59,776 --> 01:06:01,056
I mean, but you
knew that, right?

1345
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:04,210
I know that.
See, here's what I'm thinking.

1346
01:06:04,234 --> 01:06:08,710
Sybil, you are,
you are so beautiful.

1347
01:06:08,734 --> 01:06:12,085
You are such a sexy, if
you don't mind my saying so.

1348
01:06:12,109 --> 01:06:13,752
I'd like to see Nelson...

1349
01:06:13,776 --> 01:06:17,959
Well, I don't want to see but if
you and Nelson could somehow...

1350
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:21,390
Then after that,
a woman like you,

1351
01:06:21,414 --> 01:06:25,959
maybe my boy would veer
in a different direction.

1352
01:06:25,983 --> 01:06:30,085
No, I don't think
that's gonna happen.

1353
01:06:30,109 --> 01:06:31,876
I mean, we like each other,
but you know,

1354
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,627
in a friendship,
friendship kind of way.

1355
01:06:33,651 --> 01:06:35,331
Couldn't your friendship
go a little deeper

1356
01:06:35,355 --> 01:06:38,168
for 10 or 15 minutes?
He's my only son.

1357
01:06:38,192 --> 01:06:40,043
Could you imagine
how I feel?

1358
01:06:40,067 --> 01:06:42,660
I'm just thinking you're
the only woman

1359
01:06:42,684 --> 01:06:45,035
that's even close to
being in his life.

1360
01:06:45,059 --> 01:06:47,868
Maybe...
I'm begging ya, Sybil,

1361
01:06:47,892 --> 01:06:49,994
I'm begging, I'm down
on my knees. I'm begging.

1362
01:06:50,018 --> 01:06:51,827
If you, ow, okay.

1363
01:06:51,851 --> 01:06:53,535
Are you okay?

1364
01:06:53,559 --> 01:06:54,660
Come on.

1365
01:06:54,684 --> 01:06:55,868
Oh, sorry.

1366
01:06:55,892 --> 01:06:56,952
Oh, I'm sorry.

1367
01:06:56,976 --> 01:06:59,201
That's okay.

1368
01:06:59,225 --> 01:07:01,285
See, this is exactly
what I mean.

1369
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:04,660
If my boy would be as close
to you as I am right now,

1370
01:07:04,684 --> 01:07:07,618
if his body was up against yours
just like mine is right now,

1371
01:07:07,642 --> 01:07:10,201
if he touched you,
if he was this close,

1372
01:07:10,225 --> 01:07:13,451
if he could see your eyes,
your skin, your hair,

1373
01:07:13,475 --> 01:07:18,018
if he saw your lips, he
wouldn't be able to resist.

1374
01:07:19,225 --> 01:07:21,559
That's just
not gonna happen.

1375
01:07:22,934 --> 01:07:24,726
Okay.

1376
01:07:25,392 --> 01:07:27,660
- Are you okay? Yeah?
- Oh, I'm fine.

1377
01:07:27,684 --> 01:07:30,159
Thank you very much
though for considering him.

1378
01:07:30,183 --> 01:07:31,493
Thank you very much.

1379
01:07:31,517 --> 01:07:33,076
Thank you.

1380
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:34,702
I'm sorry if I took
things the wrong way.

1381
01:07:34,726 --> 01:07:36,201
It's okay.

1382
01:07:36,225 --> 01:07:38,350
- Bye.
- Bye bye.

1383
01:07:41,833 --> 01:07:43,151
[door closes]

1384
01:07:44,475 --> 01:07:45,767
That went well.

1385
01:07:48,976 --> 01:07:51,159
- Oh, excuse me.
- It's okay.

1386
01:07:51,183 --> 01:07:53,576
Wait a minute.
Don't I know you?

1387
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,326
I don't think so.

1388
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:59,743
Oh, I've seen you.
In the men's room.

1389
01:07:59,767 --> 01:08:02,243
No, I've never been in
your men's room before.

1390
01:08:02,267 --> 01:08:03,285
Trust me.

1391
01:08:03,309 --> 01:08:06,076
But your picture
doesn't do you justice.

1392
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:11,851
You are a vision of
God's gift to beauty.

1393
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:14,851
Come here.

1394
01:08:21,007 --> 01:08:22,632
Now, that's a real man.

1395
01:08:26,891 --> 01:08:28,077
Whew.

1396
01:08:32,292 --> 01:08:35,086
[birds chirping]

1397
01:08:35,726 --> 01:08:37,618
[Marty] Is there coffee yet?
Oh, okay.

1398
01:08:37,642 --> 01:08:39,671
Good morning, Martin.

1399
01:08:40,544 --> 01:08:42,526
I want to meet his parents.

1400
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:43,902
Who's parents?

1401
01:08:43,926 --> 01:08:45,068
Angelo's.

1402
01:08:45,092 --> 01:08:47,167
I don't think
I'm ready for that.

1403
01:08:47,191 --> 01:08:48,919
It's time, Martin.

1404
01:08:48,943 --> 01:08:50,593
It's time.

1405
01:08:50,617 --> 01:08:52,635
I want to get to know
his family,

1406
01:08:52,659 --> 01:08:54,779
and I'm sure he would like
to get to know us a little.

1407
01:08:54,803 --> 01:08:56,563
Why? So we can find out
which one's the bride

1408
01:08:56,587 --> 01:08:58,718
and we'll know who's paying
for the wedding?

1409
01:08:58,742 --> 01:09:02,301
Martin, it's obvious our son
has decided to settle down.

1410
01:09:02,325 --> 01:09:04,927
Yeah, well, I don't think it
was a match made in heaven.

1411
01:09:04,951 --> 01:09:06,676
Maybe it is.

1412
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:10,052
Maybe it is, and that's the
only answer that I can find

1413
01:09:10,076 --> 01:09:11,968
acceptable right now.

1414
01:09:11,992 --> 01:09:14,094
- I want to meet his parents.
- Oh, God.

1415
01:09:14,118 --> 01:09:17,385
I am Nelson's mother,
and I am entitled.

1416
01:09:17,409 --> 01:09:18,468
Maybe you can meet them

1417
01:09:18,492 --> 01:09:20,732
some time after I've had a
heart attack and dropped dead.

1418
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:22,556
- Martin, please.
- We're going. I'm thrilled.

1419
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:24,094
- It's important.
- Absolutely.

1420
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:25,259
Happiest day of my life.

1421
01:09:25,283 --> 01:09:27,259
I love you, Martin.

1422
01:09:27,283 --> 01:09:29,094
Kill me now.

1423
01:09:29,118 --> 01:09:31,976
Look, all I'm asking is
that you guys just meet them.

1424
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,426
No.

1425
01:09:33,450 --> 01:09:34,885
I'd like to meet
Nelson's mother.

1426
01:09:34,909 --> 01:09:36,052
Why?

1427
01:09:36,076 --> 01:09:37,510
So I can talk to her.

1428
01:09:37,534 --> 01:09:39,301
Maybe share some
feelings with her.

1429
01:09:39,325 --> 01:09:41,165
I think it was very nice
of her to even suggest

1430
01:09:41,189 --> 01:09:42,259
that we get together.

1431
01:09:42,283 --> 01:09:44,242
It tells me
where her heart is.

1432
01:09:46,159 --> 01:09:47,762
Come on, pop.

1433
01:09:48,672 --> 01:09:50,843
I don't like the way
they treated you

1434
01:09:50,867 --> 01:09:52,718
and the way they treat
their own son.

1435
01:09:52,742 --> 01:09:55,718
Come on. I can make a nice
dinner right here at the house.

1436
01:09:55,742 --> 01:09:58,052
What is this, an
engagement party?

1437
01:09:58,076 --> 01:09:59,356
If we're gonna meet
these people,

1438
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:00,648
it's not gonna be
in this house.

1439
01:10:00,672 --> 01:10:02,010
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1440
01:10:02,034 --> 01:10:06,010
Not in our house and nowhere
in our neighborhood either.

1441
01:10:06,034 --> 01:10:07,426
Well, where then?

1442
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:08,968
You want to meet them,

1443
01:10:08,992 --> 01:10:11,551
they're Italian, what about
an Italian restaurant?

1444
01:10:11,575 --> 01:10:13,259
[Carmine]
An Italian restaurant?

1445
01:10:13,283 --> 01:10:15,094
What do you want a
contract on my life?

1446
01:10:15,118 --> 01:10:16,259
What are you talking about?

1447
01:10:16,283 --> 01:10:18,218
Listen, honey,
we're Sicilian, right?

1448
01:10:18,242 --> 01:10:20,760
The boys find out back
home, I'm good as dead.

1449
01:10:20,784 --> 01:10:22,264
I'm gonna be
sleeping with the fishes.

1450
01:10:22,288 --> 01:10:23,635
Carmine, stop it.

1451
01:10:23,659 --> 01:10:24,676
You're blood pressure's
going up,

1452
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:26,551
and you're gonna give us
both a heart attack.

1453
01:10:26,575 --> 01:10:27,927
Now, we're gonna
meet them,

1454
01:10:27,951 --> 01:10:29,135
so where do you want
to do it?

1455
01:10:29,159 --> 01:10:30,301
They're Jewish, right?

1456
01:10:30,325 --> 01:10:31,593
Let's go for Chinese food.

1457
01:10:31,617 --> 01:10:34,052
Your father would never go
into a Chinese restaurant.

1458
01:10:34,076 --> 01:10:35,885
They're too many people
he could run into.

1459
01:10:35,909 --> 01:10:37,094
What about Sushi?

1460
01:10:37,118 --> 01:10:40,843
Oh, forget it. The Japanese
buy from us. They're out.

1461
01:10:40,867 --> 01:10:43,676
And besides that,
I hate anything raw.

1462
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:46,802
I say if it's still breathing
throw it in the ocean.

1463
01:10:46,826 --> 01:10:49,635
While you're at it, forget about
the Vietnamese, the Korean

1464
01:10:49,659 --> 01:10:52,301
and the Thais because
they're all Hirsch buyers

1465
01:10:52,325 --> 01:10:55,635
so anything Asian
is unacceptable,

1466
01:10:55,659 --> 01:10:58,259
and these days don't
even think French

1467
01:10:58,283 --> 01:11:02,076
and Italian is too heavy
and Mexican gives me gas.

1468
01:11:05,992 --> 01:11:07,968
- Take off your coat.
- We're not staying long.

1469
01:11:07,992 --> 01:11:08,968
Oh, yes we are.

1470
01:11:08,992 --> 01:11:11,968
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

1471
01:11:11,992 --> 01:11:13,752
[Shirley] I hope we haven't
kept you waiting.

1472
01:11:13,776 --> 01:11:15,094
Oh, no.
We just got here.

1473
01:11:15,118 --> 01:11:16,426
This is my husband,
Martin.

1474
01:11:16,450 --> 01:11:18,259
- Marty.
- Hi, I'm Teresa.

1475
01:11:18,283 --> 01:11:19,510
My friends call me Terry.

1476
01:11:19,534 --> 01:11:21,593
Well then, I'm
gonna call you Terry.

1477
01:11:21,617 --> 01:11:23,135
And this is my husband, Carmine.

1478
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:24,468
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do, Carmine?

1479
01:11:24,492 --> 01:11:25,676
My pleasure.
Nice to meet you.

1480
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:26,968
- I'm Marty.
- How are you?

1481
01:11:26,992 --> 01:11:28,343
This is our daughter, Andrea.

1482
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:31,259
She's lovely, and that's our
very handsome son, Anthony.

1483
01:11:31,283 --> 01:11:33,760
How do you do,
very handsome son.

1484
01:11:33,784 --> 01:11:35,593
How are you?
Nice to meet you.

1485
01:11:35,617 --> 01:11:37,135
[Shirley] Well, shall we sit?

1486
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:38,826
Yeah.

1487
01:11:44,118 --> 01:11:45,838
[Russian accent]
What is everybody drinking?

1488
01:11:45,862 --> 01:11:47,135
- Oh.
- Oh boy.

1489
01:11:47,159 --> 01:11:48,385
How you doing?

1490
01:11:48,409 --> 01:11:50,343
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

1491
01:11:50,367 --> 01:11:52,802
I'd like a glass of
white wine, please.

1492
01:11:52,826 --> 01:11:54,635
No wine.
Only vodka.

1493
01:11:54,659 --> 01:11:57,968
How about a strawberry daiquiri?

1494
01:11:57,992 --> 01:12:00,718
No, ma'am.
Only vodka.

1495
01:12:00,742 --> 01:12:03,718
I guess I'll have an only vodka
on the rocks, please.

1496
01:12:03,742 --> 01:12:05,176
I'll have an only vodka, too.

1497
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,551
I'd like my straight up
a little chilled

1498
01:12:07,575 --> 01:12:09,176
with two olives on the side.

1499
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,218
Okay, only vodka.

1500
01:12:11,242 --> 01:12:12,802
I don't think he
heard about the olives.

1501
01:12:12,826 --> 01:12:14,135
- You sir?
- Me?

1502
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:15,885
Let me have one of
those Russian beers.

1503
01:12:15,909 --> 01:12:17,259
I'll have a beer, too.

1504
01:12:17,283 --> 01:12:18,385
Only vodka.

1505
01:12:18,409 --> 01:12:20,094
[Both men]
Only vodka.

1506
01:12:20,118 --> 01:12:22,760
Sounds like a broken record.

1507
01:12:22,784 --> 01:12:23,885
I'll have vodka.

1508
01:12:23,909 --> 01:12:26,052
No, you're gonna have a coke.

1509
01:12:26,076 --> 01:12:27,176
I'll have a vodka.

1510
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,680
No, she's gonna
have what he's having.

1511
01:12:28,704 --> 01:12:29,718
No vodka.

1512
01:12:29,742 --> 01:12:30,802
You want to get a bottle?

1513
01:12:30,826 --> 01:12:32,176
Yeah. Let's get a bottle.

1514
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,593
Vodka, only vodka.

1515
01:12:33,617 --> 01:12:35,010
That brand.
What's that brand?

1516
01:12:35,034 --> 01:12:36,301
The only brand.

1517
01:12:36,325 --> 01:12:37,635
Only vodka.

1518
01:12:37,659 --> 01:12:39,700
I hope the food's good.

1519
01:12:40,492 --> 01:12:41,802
I want to thank you

1520
01:12:41,826 --> 01:12:43,626
for suggesting that we
get together like this.

1521
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:45,010
Oh, that's so sweet.

1522
01:12:45,034 --> 01:12:46,176
Did you hear that,
Martin?

1523
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,718
Yes, nice, yeah.

1524
01:12:47,742 --> 01:12:51,301
You know, I'm glad in a way that
Nelson and Angelo didn't come

1525
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:54,176
so we could talk more
openly about, you know,

1526
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,802
what we need to
talk openly about.

1527
01:12:55,826 --> 01:12:57,968
My sentiments as well.

1528
01:12:57,992 --> 01:13:02,052
I brought some photos of
Angelo when he was growing up.

1529
01:13:02,076 --> 01:13:03,176
I did, too.

1530
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,927
I brought pictures
of Nelson.

1531
01:13:04,951 --> 01:13:06,718
- Can we order?
- Yeah, let's...

1532
01:13:06,742 --> 01:13:08,182
You know, my
stomach's growling here.

1533
01:13:08,206 --> 01:13:09,885
What's the rush?
We've got all night.

1534
01:13:09,909 --> 01:13:12,635
- Let's order. What do you say?
- Martin, wait. Relax.

1535
01:13:12,659 --> 01:13:14,551
Here's Angelo when
he was a year old.

1536
01:13:14,575 --> 01:13:16,301
Oh, my God.

1537
01:13:16,325 --> 01:13:17,593
Is he gorgeous?

1538
01:13:17,617 --> 01:13:18,676
Thank you.

1539
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:20,218
Look, Marty,
is he gorgeous?

1540
01:13:20,242 --> 01:13:21,510
Yeah. He's naked.

1541
01:13:21,534 --> 01:13:23,534
How come he's on his belly
with his ass in the air?

1542
01:13:23,558 --> 01:13:24,052
Oh, stop.

1543
01:13:24,076 --> 01:13:26,927
That's how all one-year-old
babies are photographed.

1544
01:13:26,951 --> 01:13:29,343
This is Nelson at
his bar mitzvah.

1545
01:13:29,367 --> 01:13:31,885
Oh, he's very handsome.

1546
01:13:31,909 --> 01:13:33,343
Oh, Carmine, look.

1547
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:35,301
Oh, looks a little pale
in all that long hair.

1548
01:13:35,325 --> 01:13:36,468
Looks like a girl.

1549
01:13:36,492 --> 01:13:37,676
He's only 13.

1550
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:39,259
Boys don't even
shave when they're 13.

1551
01:13:39,283 --> 01:13:40,927
I started shaving
when I was eight.

1552
01:13:40,951 --> 01:13:43,510
Started shaving his back
when he was eight.

1553
01:13:43,534 --> 01:13:46,176
Here's one of Angelo
when he was confirmed.

1554
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,927
Oh, beautiful.

1555
01:13:47,951 --> 01:13:50,135
Oh, here's Nelson
in high school.

1556
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,135
Oh yes.
Isn't he handsome?

1557
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:53,343
Look.

1558
01:13:53,367 --> 01:13:55,218
[laughs]

1559
01:13:55,242 --> 01:13:56,442
You want to share
that thought?

1560
01:13:56,466 --> 01:13:57,843
No, I don't think so.

1561
01:13:57,867 --> 01:13:59,259
I don't think you want to
hear what I have to say.

1562
01:13:59,283 --> 01:14:01,176
- No, why don't you just say it.
- Say what?

1563
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,385
Say there's
something wrong with my kid.

1564
01:14:02,409 --> 01:14:04,593
I never said there was
anything wrong with your kid.

1565
01:14:04,617 --> 01:14:05,968
- You said something.
- Marty?

1566
01:14:05,992 --> 01:14:07,385
- With that little...
- I didn't say anything.

1567
01:14:07,409 --> 01:14:09,635
Marty, I would love to dance.
Let's dance. Come on.

1568
01:14:09,659 --> 01:14:11,301
I don't think you
can dance like this.

1569
01:14:11,325 --> 01:14:12,760
Want to see a picture
of my son?

1570
01:14:12,784 --> 01:14:16,385
This is Angelo,
golden gloves champ,

1571
01:14:16,409 --> 01:14:17,551
feather weight.

1572
01:14:17,575 --> 01:14:18,802
- Oh yeah.
- That's my boy.

1573
01:14:18,826 --> 01:14:20,468
That's when you land
on your feet, right?

1574
01:14:20,492 --> 01:14:21,843
Can I have the
vodka, please?

1575
01:14:21,867 --> 01:14:23,707
Sure. You want to see
my kid, he's a sportsman?

1576
01:14:23,731 --> 01:14:25,259
Look at him.
See him on skis?

1577
01:14:25,283 --> 01:14:26,593
- Yeah.
- He's almost Olympic.

1578
01:14:26,617 --> 01:14:27,635
Almost Olympic?

1579
01:14:27,659 --> 01:14:29,885
I didn't know they gave out
medals for almost Olympic.

1580
01:14:29,909 --> 01:14:32,385
Well, well, well.
What do we have here?

1581
01:14:32,409 --> 01:14:35,510
Your son was a cheerleader,
a freaking male cheerleader.

1582
01:14:35,534 --> 01:14:37,718
What about this one over
here with your kid in a skirt?

1583
01:14:37,742 --> 01:14:40,259
It wasn't a skirt.
He was acting in a play.

1584
01:14:40,283 --> 01:14:42,135
He played Julius Caesar
in high school.

1585
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:44,551
- He was a thespian.
- Oh, my condolences.

1586
01:14:44,575 --> 01:14:45,802
It started in high school.

1587
01:14:45,826 --> 01:14:46,843
I'm sorry about that.

1588
01:14:46,867 --> 01:14:48,718
What the hell is your problem?

1589
01:14:48,742 --> 01:14:51,259
My kid didn't even know what
gay was until he met your kid.

1590
01:14:51,283 --> 01:14:53,968
I think your son
kind of converted him.

1591
01:14:53,992 --> 01:14:58,052
Dad, you don't make people gay
like a Dr. Frankenstein thing.

1592
01:14:58,076 --> 01:15:00,176
People are either
born gay or they're not.

1593
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,800
Maybe you should
listen to your daughter.

1594
01:15:01,824 --> 01:15:03,094
Let me ask you something.

1595
01:15:03,118 --> 01:15:05,094
How do you know your son
wasn't a finocchio

1596
01:15:05,118 --> 01:15:06,593
before my son came along?

1597
01:15:06,617 --> 01:15:09,094
- I don't even know what a...
- Finocchio.

1598
01:15:09,118 --> 01:15:10,278
What the hell is a finocchio?

1599
01:15:10,302 --> 01:15:11,635
It's like a faygala.

1600
01:15:11,659 --> 01:15:13,176
It's not a very
nice thing to say.

1601
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,551
This would probably be perfect
for the Jerry Springer show.

1602
01:15:15,575 --> 01:15:17,895
I mean you might as well make
some money while we're at it.

1603
01:15:17,919 --> 01:15:19,551
This is better
than Springer.

1604
01:15:19,957 --> 01:15:21,421
Oh yeah.

1605
01:15:35,537 --> 01:15:36,662
[door closes]

1606
01:15:38,861 --> 01:15:40,921
Shirley,
what are you--

1607
01:15:40,945 --> 01:15:42,676
What?

1608
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:44,259
- Shirley.
- What do you want?

1609
01:15:44,283 --> 01:15:46,510
It's electric. If you want gas,
it's down there.

1610
01:15:46,534 --> 01:15:50,054
Oh. What? You want me down
on my knees?

1611
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:51,763
That's not a bad idea.

1612
01:15:51,787 --> 01:15:54,676
Listen, the least
you could do,

1613
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:56,301
if you want to
kill yourself,

1614
01:15:56,325 --> 01:15:57,965
you could at least
have taken me with you.

1615
01:15:57,989 --> 01:15:59,600
Oh, honey.

1616
01:15:59,624 --> 01:16:02,930
[dramatic music]

1617
01:16:03,666 --> 01:16:07,259
[Nelson] I wish we could just
get on a boat,

1618
01:16:07,283 --> 01:16:11,426
sail away, find an island,
just be free.

1619
01:16:12,959 --> 01:16:14,802
There are no islands
like that.

1620
01:16:14,826 --> 01:16:17,385
I mean, there are, they're
just like really expensive.

1621
01:16:17,409 --> 01:16:20,301
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah, I do.

1622
01:16:20,793 --> 01:16:25,335
Hey, and you are
a very sweet man.

1623
01:16:31,264 --> 01:16:33,847
Hey, where'd did you go?

1624
01:16:35,323 --> 01:16:37,202
What?

1625
01:16:37,226 --> 01:16:40,059
I need to know
where you stand.

1626
01:16:41,450 --> 01:16:45,635
I don't want to hear any more
crap about boats and islands.

1627
01:16:46,059 --> 01:16:50,410
We already live
on an island, right?

1628
01:16:50,434 --> 01:16:57,243
Our love is like
our very own island.

1629
01:16:57,267 --> 01:16:59,327
We already told
our parents.

1630
01:16:59,351 --> 01:17:01,494
- What more do you want?
- Uh-uh.

1631
01:17:01,518 --> 01:17:04,059
That's not enough,
hot dog.

1632
01:17:05,059 --> 01:17:09,535
I love you, and I want to
take the next step,

1633
01:17:09,559 --> 01:17:12,309
you know,
what we talked about?

1634
01:17:13,059 --> 01:17:17,267
[romantic music]

1635
01:17:35,434 --> 01:17:38,535
Sophie, what channel?
Marty, turn on the TV.

1636
01:17:38,559 --> 01:17:39,826
They're on TV.

1637
01:17:39,850 --> 01:17:41,618
- Who's on TV.?
- Who? Our boys.

1638
01:17:41,642 --> 01:17:44,184
- What?
- Channel five. Turn it on.

1639
01:17:45,226 --> 01:17:47,701
A gay couple living together
making a life together

1640
01:17:47,725 --> 01:17:50,535
has just succeeded in tackling
one of the most controversial issues

1641
01:17:50,559 --> 01:17:51,993
in recent years.

1642
01:17:52,017 --> 01:17:55,118
Nelson Hirsch and Angelo Ferraro
are getting the governor

1643
01:17:55,142 --> 01:17:56,782
and the director of
the welfare department

1644
01:17:56,806 --> 01:17:59,610
for the state of New York to
give them an adoption license.

1645
01:17:59,634 --> 01:18:01,776
These two young gay men
are adopting a child,

1646
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,193
which they will raise
together in their home.

1647
01:18:04,217 --> 01:18:06,943
How do you feel about the
opposition on your decision?

1648
01:18:06,967 --> 01:18:09,943
You know, we're just so
thankful to the lord almighty

1649
01:18:09,967 --> 01:18:12,866
that we live in this great
and courageous country

1650
01:18:12,890 --> 01:18:17,110
that allows us the freedom to
live by our individual truths.

1651
01:18:17,134 --> 01:18:19,485
We just want the same
rights as any other family.

1652
01:18:19,509 --> 01:18:20,859
Yeah, and that
means having kids.

1653
01:18:20,883 --> 01:18:22,603
I mean, the only thing
we haven't decided is

1654
01:18:22,627 --> 01:18:24,776
whether or not our son's
gonna be Jewish or Catholic.

1655
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,652
He has to be Jewish.

1656
01:18:26,676 --> 01:18:28,068
There you have it.

1657
01:18:28,092 --> 01:18:29,776
Nelson Hirsch
and Angelo Ferraro,

1658
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:31,859
a happy father
and a happy father.

1659
01:18:31,883 --> 01:18:33,676
Turn it off.

1660
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:41,509
Good morning,
Mr. Hirsch.

1661
01:18:52,551 --> 01:18:55,634
[indiscreet chatter]

1662
01:19:02,883 --> 01:19:03,985
Shirley.

1663
01:19:04,009 --> 01:19:05,026
Oh, hello, Sophie.

1664
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:06,694
How have you been?
You don't call.

1665
01:19:06,718 --> 01:19:07,943
You don't write.

1666
01:19:07,967 --> 01:19:10,694
We never get a chance to
see you and Marty anymore.

1667
01:19:10,718 --> 01:19:13,151
Well, there's a good
reason for that, Sophie.

1668
01:19:13,175 --> 01:19:14,985
So what's new?

1669
01:19:15,009 --> 01:19:16,360
What's new?

1670
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:18,985
Speaking of news, what
do you think of the news?

1671
01:19:19,009 --> 01:19:20,818
- The news.
- You never called me back.

1672
01:19:20,842 --> 01:19:22,443
Sophie, you know,
I don't watch the news.

1673
01:19:22,467 --> 01:19:23,787
I don't know what
was on the news.

1674
01:19:23,811 --> 01:19:25,735
Congratulations.

1675
01:19:25,759 --> 01:19:27,859
Finally,
you're a grandmother.

1676
01:19:27,883 --> 01:19:32,276
Nelson had a baby, and I didn't
even know he was seeing anyone.

1677
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:36,074
Sophie, do you know the
Yiddish word for fuck off?

1678
01:19:36,098 --> 01:19:38,110
Ge kaken af em yam?

1679
01:19:38,134 --> 01:19:41,318
That's it, but I like
fuck off much better.

1680
01:19:41,342 --> 01:19:43,592
- Up yours.
- Shirley!

1681
01:19:44,634 --> 01:19:47,068
Oh, Sophie,
just leave me alone.

1682
01:19:47,092 --> 01:19:49,276
Come on, Shirley.

1683
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:50,818
Come on.

1684
01:19:50,842 --> 01:19:53,985
Listen, everybody
knows about Nelson.

1685
01:19:54,009 --> 01:19:55,985
You have to be brave.

1686
01:19:56,009 --> 01:19:58,527
You have to face the
realities of life.

1687
01:19:58,551 --> 01:20:00,402
I don't know.

1688
01:20:00,426 --> 01:20:02,485
I don't know why.

1689
01:20:02,509 --> 01:20:06,694
Oh, Sophie, you don't understand
what I've been going through.

1690
01:20:06,718 --> 01:20:09,151
I mean, Martin doesn't
understand what's going on

1691
01:20:09,175 --> 01:20:12,610
and you don't know
the pain I've been in.

1692
01:20:12,634 --> 01:20:16,652
I know.
I've lived with it for 20 years.

1693
01:20:16,676 --> 01:20:18,652
I know.

1694
01:20:18,676 --> 01:20:20,735
You know about Max?

1695
01:20:20,759 --> 01:20:24,652
I do. I just found out,
and I'm so sorry.

1696
01:20:24,676 --> 01:20:25,776
I'm sorry.

1697
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,694
Well, it's not that bad.

1698
01:20:27,718 --> 01:20:28,818
No, stop.

1699
01:20:28,842 --> 01:20:32,235
Every now and then, ACDC.

1700
01:20:32,259 --> 01:20:34,110
You know what?
I can't believe it.

1701
01:20:34,134 --> 01:20:35,527
I just can't believe
it's true.

1702
01:20:35,551 --> 01:20:38,985
You learn to live with it,
and you move on.

1703
01:20:39,009 --> 01:20:42,985
Whatever makes people
happy is all that matters.

1704
01:20:43,532 --> 01:20:45,443
Oh.

1705
01:20:45,467 --> 01:20:46,943
I'm sorry.

1706
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:48,967
Every time the phone rings
I feel like I'm in court

1707
01:20:48,991 --> 01:20:51,443
giving testimony
in my son's defense.

1708
01:20:51,467 --> 01:20:53,735
Yeah. I don't answer
the phone anymore.

1709
01:20:53,759 --> 01:20:55,068
Even when it doesn't ring,

1710
01:20:55,092 --> 01:20:56,892
I know there are thousands
of people out there

1711
01:20:56,916 --> 01:20:58,610
dying to call me.

1712
01:20:58,634 --> 01:21:02,235
I'm going to avoid our family
for the rest of our lives.

1713
01:21:02,259 --> 01:21:03,276
Shirley.

1714
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:04,694
Oh, and I don't
want a telephone.

1715
01:21:04,718 --> 01:21:07,694
I want all the listed
numbers unlisted.

1716
01:21:07,718 --> 01:21:10,360
I can't handle this, Marty.
I'm not strong enough.

1717
01:21:10,384 --> 01:21:12,276
[phone ringing]

1718
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:14,050
Don't answer it.

1719
01:21:14,983 --> 01:21:16,710
Hello.

1720
01:21:16,734 --> 01:21:18,585
Oh, Sophie. [chuckles]

1721
01:21:18,609 --> 01:21:20,043
Yeah.

1722
01:21:20,067 --> 01:21:21,335
They're on?

1723
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:23,234
Marty, they're on.

1724
01:21:26,776 --> 01:21:28,418
[On TV]
Thank you, Jack.

1725
01:21:28,442 --> 01:21:31,752
This is Christine Anderson
reporting live from downtown,

1726
01:21:31,776 --> 01:21:35,418
and unfolding behind me is
what was, until 30 minutes ago,

1727
01:21:35,442 --> 01:21:39,251
a quiet, peaceful demonstration,
which escalated very rapidly

1728
01:21:39,275 --> 01:21:41,168
into something at the
other end of the spectrum.

1729
01:21:41,192 --> 01:21:43,710
Now, from what we understand,
there has been a police presence

1730
01:21:43,734 --> 01:21:46,502
on location all morning, and
there are reinforcements

1731
01:21:46,526 --> 01:21:49,376
on their way which are
quite needed at this point.

1732
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:52,752
At the heart of the controversy
is the adoption of a baby

1733
01:21:52,776 --> 01:21:55,918
by a gay couple, two young men,
Nelson Hirsch

1734
01:21:55,942 --> 01:21:57,918
and Angelo Ferraro.

1735
01:21:57,942 --> 01:21:59,710
Equal rights!

1736
01:21:59,734 --> 01:22:03,025
[crowd chanting]

1737
01:22:06,734 --> 01:22:09,109
You bunch of fruits.

1738
01:22:12,027 --> 01:22:14,668
You're just mad because no
one will have a baby with you.

1739
01:22:14,692 --> 01:22:17,918
Excuse me, please.
I got to find my son.

1740
01:22:17,942 --> 01:22:19,376
- Hey!
- Here you are.

1741
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,001
Hi, sweetheart.

1742
01:22:21,025 --> 01:22:22,959
- Hi.
- Nelson.

1743
01:22:22,983 --> 01:22:24,918
- Oh God, look.
- You started this, huh?

1744
01:22:24,942 --> 01:22:27,001
[Shirley] Here comes my
mashuganasister-in-law.

1745
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:29,794
I saw the boychik
on television.

1746
01:22:29,818 --> 01:22:31,752
I thought I could
maybe lend a hand.

1747
01:22:31,776 --> 01:22:33,752
Come on.
Come on in.

1748
01:22:33,776 --> 01:22:35,876
Oh, look at those people.

1749
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:39,400
[chanting]
God hates gays!

1750
01:22:40,359 --> 01:22:42,859
[chanting]
Equal rights!

1751
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:44,502
Excuse us.

1752
01:22:44,526 --> 01:22:46,460
[Shirley] Oh, hi, Terry.

1753
01:22:46,484 --> 01:22:48,627
- Are you okay?
- Dad, what are you doing here?

1754
01:22:48,651 --> 01:22:49,931
What do you think
I'm doing here?

1755
01:22:49,955 --> 01:22:52,001
- Come on, look at this.
- Got a little action here?

1756
01:22:52,025 --> 01:22:54,502
- Are you ready or what?
- To do what?

1757
01:22:54,526 --> 01:22:57,168
See that asshole over
there with the bald head?

1758
01:22:57,192 --> 01:22:58,752
The one that looks
like a cue ball?

1759
01:22:58,776 --> 01:23:00,585
- You gonna take him?
- No, he's for you.

1760
01:23:00,609 --> 01:23:02,210
- Oh.
- Bunch of mooks, huh?

1761
01:23:02,234 --> 01:23:03,502
Yeah, it's genetics.

1762
01:23:03,526 --> 01:23:05,359
You want a piece
of me?

1763
01:23:06,317 --> 01:23:08,710
[chanting]

1764
01:23:08,734 --> 01:23:10,214
You don't mean to deal
with me, right?

1765
01:23:10,238 --> 01:23:11,710
No, no, no.
We got Nicky here.

1766
01:23:11,734 --> 01:23:12,752
Nick, you ready?

1767
01:23:12,776 --> 01:23:14,293
The guys are starving
for this man. Let us go.

1768
01:23:14,317 --> 01:23:15,710
Come on Carmine.
Let's do it.

1769
01:23:15,734 --> 01:23:17,043
- You want us?
- Come on.

1770
01:23:17,067 --> 01:23:18,752
- You ready?
- Come on.

1771
01:23:18,776 --> 01:23:20,876
- Say semper fi.
- All right. Semper fi.

1772
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:22,317
Yeah.

1773
01:23:23,038 --> 01:23:26,522
[overlapping yelling]

1774
01:23:29,567 --> 01:23:31,502
[Carmine] Yeah, Nicky.
That's it. Hit him.

1775
01:23:31,526 --> 01:23:33,043
Get off me, you ape.

1776
01:23:33,067 --> 01:23:35,150
[Police] Break it up.

1777
01:23:36,234 --> 01:23:39,710
Let me tell you something,
melon head.

1778
01:23:39,734 --> 01:23:43,210
Stay out of my neighborhood and
keep your remarks to yourself.

1779
01:23:43,234 --> 01:23:44,942
[Martin] I thought you said
he was for me?

1780
01:23:47,317 --> 01:23:48,835
- You all right?
- No.

1781
01:23:48,859 --> 01:23:50,376
Let me reiterate.

1782
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,835
I see you again,
me and my buddy here

1783
01:23:52,859 --> 01:23:55,460
are gonna send you to Sicily
on two separate boats.

1784
01:23:55,484 --> 01:23:56,724
- Are you hurt?
- I'm all right.

1785
01:23:56,748 --> 01:23:58,835
- He's okay. He's a trooper.
- Okay. I'm all right.

1786
01:23:58,859 --> 01:24:00,835
[Reporter] Excuse me, ma'am.
Ma'am?

1787
01:24:00,859 --> 01:24:02,859
Are you willing to talk to
us for a moment, please?

1788
01:24:02,883 --> 01:24:04,959
Well, I... my husband's been
hurt, and I have to go.

1789
01:24:04,983 --> 01:24:07,415
Can you just tell us
why you're here today?

1790
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:12,134
Well, I...
Just for a minute, okay?

1791
01:24:13,182 --> 01:24:14,794
I belong here.

1792
01:24:14,818 --> 01:24:19,460
These people here are my
family, and I'm Shirley.

1793
01:24:19,484 --> 01:24:21,564
I'm Shirley Hirsch,

1794
01:24:21,588 --> 01:24:27,763
and I am the proud mother
of my son, Nelson.

1795
01:24:27,787 --> 01:24:31,794
And I'm the proud grandmother
of my grandchild,

1796
01:24:31,818 --> 01:24:34,959
the child of Nelson
and Angelo,

1797
01:24:34,983 --> 01:24:38,952
and I'm just very happy
to be here today,

1798
01:24:38,976 --> 01:24:41,243
very, very happy.

1799
01:24:41,267 --> 01:24:44,035
Is there anything else you'd
like our viewers to know today?

1800
01:24:44,059 --> 01:24:45,660
Yes.

1801
01:24:45,684 --> 01:24:50,201
I want them to know that
they have the right

1802
01:24:50,225 --> 01:24:53,827
to love anyone that
they so choose to,

1803
01:24:53,851 --> 01:24:58,493
that they can love anyone.
Thank you, bye.

1804
01:24:58,517 --> 01:25:00,660
Thank you for
talking to us.

1805
01:25:00,684 --> 01:25:01,994

Good.

1812
01:26:21,475 --> 01:26:24,576
Okay, I need both families
right here on the steps.

01:26:25,068 --> 01:26:27,243
Both families.

- Congratulations.
- He's beautiful.

1816

He's snoring.

Ferraro family over here.

1818
01:26:33,517 --> 01:26:37,451
Oh, let me see
that beautiful baby.

1819
01:26:37,475 --> 01:26:39,159
- Great.
- Are we proud or what?

1820
01:26:39,183 --> 01:26:41,076
- Smile.
- That's good.

1821
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:42,952
- Now, hold it.
- What are you doing here?

1822
01:26:42,976 --> 01:26:46,885
Stop everything.
Nobody move.

1823
01:26:46,909 --> 01:26:49,052
This boy will be circumcised.

1824
01:26:49,076 --> 01:26:50,510
Who is this lunatic?

1825
01:26:50,534 --> 01:26:52,010
This is my uncle Moishe.

1826
01:26:52,034 --> 01:26:53,434
Say hello to uncle
Moishe everybody.

[All]
Hi, Moishe.

This boy is a member
of my family.

1829
01:26:57,076 --> 01:26:58,510
He gets circumcised.

1830
01:26:58,534 --> 01:27:00,654
What are you gonna circumcise
him on the church steps?

1831
01:27:00,678 --> 01:27:01,927
Where else?
It's perfect.

1832
01:27:01,951 --> 01:27:03,343
Why do you want
to snip him?

1833
01:27:03,367 --> 01:27:04,635
The boy's gonna
need every inch.

1834
01:27:04,659 --> 01:27:05,676

01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:06,760

[both] He is.

1838
01:27:10,785 --> 01:27:12,201
And the mother?

1839
01:27:13,367 --> 01:27:15,551
Well, he is.

1840
01:27:15,575 --> 01:27:16,927
- What?
- Hey, come on Moishe.

Get in the picture here.

1842
01:27:18,242 --> 01:27:20,843
Moishe, let me
unburden your soul.

1843
01:27:20,867 --> 01:27:22,927
I have a unique
perspective.

1844
01:27:22,951 --> 01:27:24,176
Come on, everybody.

1845
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:26,259
