{\an8}Yeah.

- I could go for some breakfast.

something to eat?

{\an8}Mmm.

12
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,453
{\an8}I did. I hung out with
the crudites table all night,

{\an8}trying to work up
the courage
to talk to you

{\an8}because I knew you'd be back.

to the crudite table,

{\an8}trying to get you to notice me.

17
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,962

you walked in the door.

Google-stalk me?

what to put in my phone.

{\an8}Oh. I'm not giving you
my phone number.

{\an8}I forgot that I made plans
with my friends today.

I did, but now I'm not so sure.

We can't even agree
on a restaurant.

60

it was pretty tasty.

It was very salty.

They're Katt Williams' jokes.

his jokes from Katt Williams?

00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,773
you need to be on the same page.

166
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,123
{\an5}I feel like I'm on one page
of the book and you're,
like, reading a magazine.

167
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,375
Yeah. I would love to be
on the same page as you,

168
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,878
{\an5}but you're always
locked in your office
editing that movie.

169
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,129
It's not a movie.

170
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,466
{\an5}This is a documentary
about corruption
in the educational system.

171
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,360
How would I know?
You won't even show it to me.

172
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,112
{\an5}-I'll show it to you
whenever you want.
-Been working on it forever.

173
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,471
Okay, great.
How about tomorrow?

174
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,265
I can't do it tomorrow.
I'm rendering the animation.

175
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,686
Steph and George
are getting married?

176
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,271
Did you just like that?

177
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,231
Yeah.

178
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,236
{\an5}-What happened to
"marriage is bullshit"?
-It is.

179
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,489
Okay. Well, then
why did you like it?

180
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,009
{\an3}Because I didn't wanna be
the only one out of our friends

181
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,784
to not like it.
I'm not a hater.

182
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,995
Okay. Since the day
we've met,

183
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,623
{\an5}you've talked about
how you think marriage
is fucking lame.

184
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,708
I didn't say "lame."
I said "problematic."

185
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,961
{\an5}Right. Two people declaring
their eternal love
for each other.

186
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,338
How problematic.

187
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,715
{\an5}You know what I think?
I think you do want
all that stuff.

188
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,301
{\an5}Marriage and kids.
You just don't
want it with me.

189
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:33,221
And I think that you just want
someone with no expectations,

190
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,015
{\an5}so you can sit in that room
by yourself
for the rest of your life.

191
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,582
I think you just want
a relationship

192
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,036
that you can brag about
to your friends.

193
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,229
Yeah, I do!
And I'm not willing to settle.

194
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,539
I don't wanna settle, either.

195
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,358
{\an5}That's why I don't
wanna be with someone
who's so fucking shallow.

196
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,421
And I don't wanna
be with someone

197
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,697
who's so satisfied
with being a failure.

198
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,030
- I can't do this anymore.
- [Leilani] This isn't working.

199
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,629
[blinker clicking]

200
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,095
Are we done?

201
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,472
I think we've been done
for a while.

202
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,062
[tires screech]

203
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,064
- [Jibran] Oh, fuck!
- [Leilani] Shit!

204
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,359
- [Jibran] Oh, fuck. Uh...
- [Leilani] Shit.

205
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,863
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- [Jibran] Uh...

206
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,949
- Uh, are you okay?
- [Leilani] You okay?

207
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,535
Oh, there's blood.
Here, let me help you up.

208
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,221
[Leilani] No, no, you probably
shouldn't move him.

209
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,371
[Jibran] Oh, right. Yeah.

210
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,456
{\an8}-I'm gonna call 911, okay?
- No, no, no!

211
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,041
I'm fine. I gotta go.

212
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,227
You're bleeding,
you're not fine.

213
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,770
- [Jibran] Are you sure?
- I gotta go. I gotta go!

214
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,212
[Jibran gasps] Oh.

215
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,880
[cyclist whimpers]

216
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,550
[Jibran] Uh... I don't know
if that's a good idea, man.

217
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,719
- Thank you.
- I'll call 911.

218
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:57,471
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait! You forgot your phone!

219
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,890
[Jibran] Oh, my God.

220
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,481
[both scream]

221
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,484
- I need your car!
- What?

222
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,236
I'm a police officer
and he's a criminal!

223
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,904
Move the fuck over!
Get in the back!

224
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,281
Move, move, move!

225
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,073
Hold on.

226
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:21,996
- Where'd he go?
- Huh?

227
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,331
- Where'd he go?
- [mumbles]

228
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,666
- [stammers]
- He went that way!

229
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,960
East! East!
Uh, suspect headed eastbound.

230
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,801
What did he do? Was it drugs?

231
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,571
It was drugs, huh?
Are you undercover?

232
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,675
{\an5}You can't tell us
if you're undercover, huh?
I get it.

233
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,599
At least we didn't hit
a good guy, right?

234
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,268
{\an5}It's not good
that we hit someone,
but at least we hit a bad guy?

235
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,520
Yeah, who rides a bike
in this part of town?

236
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,165
Yeah, where do you think
you are, Europe?

237
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,482
[Jibran and Leilani laugh]

238
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,402
Sorry, we'll be serious.

239
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,529
Right there! There he goes!

240
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:56,697
[tires squealing]

241
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,700
[man]
Off the sidewalk, asshole!

242
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,166
[Jibran] Turn, turn, turn!

243
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,043
We got him. Yes!

244
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,880
- [Jibran] Shit!
- [car horn blaring]

245
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,425
Rats! Right?

246
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,362
Wait, if you make a left
up here, you can cut him off.

247
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,804
Oh, good idea. Oh!

248
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,390
- [Jibran] Yep!
- Whoo.

249
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,043
- There he is, over there!
- Oh! Oh!

250
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,103
[engine accelerating]

251
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,854
Oh.

252
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,357
[Jibran] Fucking jaywalkers.

253
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,440
[cyclist whimpers]

254
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,945
- [tires screech]
- [car horn blares]

255
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,489
Shit, he's going in circles!
What an idiot!

256
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,700
[panting]

257
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,704
- [Leilani] Turn! Turn!
- [Jibran] Turn! [grunts]

258
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,205
There, there, there!
Go, go, go!

259
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,289
He turned the corner!

260
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,083
Go down this alley,
it's a dead end!

261
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,086
Ho, ho, ho! Justice!

262
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,843
[engine accelerates]

263
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,720
Oh, my God!

264
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,055
[grunts]

265
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,563
[cyclist groaning]

266
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,232
[shifts gears]

267
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,111
- [cyclist whimpers]
- [thudding]

268
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,114
[Jibran] Um...

269
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,326
- [tires screech]
- Oh, oh...

270
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,370
- [thud]
- [tires squeal]

271
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,793
- [thudding]
- Oh, my God.

272
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,674
[car door closes]

273
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,517
I don't think he's a cop.

274
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,907
[police siren approaching]

275
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,209
[couple chattering and laughing]

276
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,170
[woman] Oh, my God.

277
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,005
[man] Hello?

278
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,409
[woman] I think
he's fucking dead.

279
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,384
Oh, shit!

280
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,179
- [man] What the fuck?
- Oh, my God.

281
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,060
Oh, my God, what did you do?

282
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,605
- Oh. Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, oh... No, no, no.

283
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:35,749
This isn't what it looks like.

284
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:36,833
[Jibran] We didn't kill him.

285
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,359
You hit him with your car, man.

286
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,069
No! I mean, yes, I did, but...

287
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,238
- No, that was... That's all.
- That was a while ago.

288
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,322
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

289
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,659
After I hit him,
he was alive and, like, great.

290
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,494
Not "great."
He wasn't having the best day,

291
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,017
but he has been breathing
since then.

292
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,247
He's fucking dead!

293
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,457
We know he's dead,
but we didn't kill him.

294
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,667
He just said he killed him.

295
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,961
No. I said I hit him
with my car.

296
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,814
{\an6}-Clearly it worked. You killed
a guy with your car, man!
-[Leilani] Okay, but, no, wait.

297
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,650
{\an5}-We hit him earlier and then
we were just drivin' to...
-[Jibran] I was driving,

298
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,443
{\an5}-and we broke up,
and I got distracted...
- Bobby and Reya's house.

299
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,301
[Jibran] ...and I ran through
a red light...

300
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,219
- But a moustache came in...
- [Leilani] But then this guy

301
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,696
with a weird moustache...
No, we hit him earlier.

302
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,305
I helped him a little bit
with my map,

303
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,866
which I admit
was definitely a mistake.

304
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,690
He took our car,
he ran over him like a dog...

305
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,953
{\an3}[man] We need to call the cops.

306
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,979
And then back and forth
ten times

307
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,665
[hysterically] and now I've
got a dead guy's blood on me

308
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,129
and my car's
a fucking murder weapon!

309
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,984
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling 911.

310
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,586
Please don't do that.
We would never hurt anyone.

311
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,279
I'd like to report
a murder or whatever.

312
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,697
We didn't murder anybody!

313
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,532
- Yeah, stop.
- [Leilani] You stop!

314
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,052
Oh, my God, the police
aren't gonna believe us.

315
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,661
Do you know how stupid we sound?

316
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,330
- This is a citizen's arrest.
- What is that?

317
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,599
It's an arrest from a citizen.

318
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,624
Can you do that?

319
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,960
- Can he do that?
- On the count of three. Okay?

320
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,104
On the count of three, what?

321
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,129
What is that face?

322
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,381
I can't read your face!
Just say it.

323
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,525
[under breath]
On the count of three.

324
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,175
- What? What?
- One, two, three, go!

325
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,594
[woman]
The guy just ran for it.

326
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,678
[Leilani] Jibran!

327
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,001
Okay, the guy's name is Jibran.

328
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,472
Run, Leilani!

329
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,950
And the girl's name
is actually Leilani.

330
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,267
Shit.

331
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,102
[woman] She's...
She's running too now.

332
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,104
She just happens to be
African-American

333
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,356
and he just happens to be
a person of color as well.

334
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,834
But I don't, like,
think they're murderers

335
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,711
because they're minorities.
I think they're murderers

336
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,337
[sobbing] because they
literally just killed a guy

337
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,946
- and he's laying here.
- Oh, fuck.

338
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,994
[music playing softly
on speakers]

339
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,459
[waitress] Hey.

340
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,295
Are you okay?

341
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,817
{\an5}-[Jibran] Nosebleeds.
-[Leilani] It's house painting
with red paint.

342
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,552
We were painting the kitchen
blood colors?

343
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,601
What can I get for you guys?

344
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,227
Do you have alcohol?

345
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,647
- Two, please.
- Two.

346
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,731
Two what?

347
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,150
Two alcohols, please.
Thank you so much.

348
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,945
We don't serve alcohol.

349
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,368
We have to go to the police.

350
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,078
Us?

351
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,538
You and me?

352
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,290
How do you think
that's gonna go?

353
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,334
It's the best bad idea.

354
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,128
No, it's not. They're gonna
arrest us in two seconds.

355
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,005
Maybe we just tell them
the truth.

356
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,524
Do you think the police
care about the truth?

357
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,609
Do you think
they're gonna give us

358
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,051
the benefit of the doubt?

359
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,761
- But what else?
- Jibran,

360
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,930
the truth sounds crazy.

361
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,254
What are you gonna say to them?

362
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,434
"Hello, Officer.

363
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,771
We are turning ourselves in
for now,

364
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,190
because we have
nothing to hide."

365
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,168
"Then why'd you run
from the scene of the crime?"

366
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,402
"Good question, Officer.

367
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,821
That's why
you're good at your job.

368
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,907
It's because we looked guilty.

369
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,160
Which was scary for us,
because we are not guilty.

370
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,746
So, in a way, us running
only proves that we are..."

371
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,082
"That's me covering up
my bodycam,

372
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,918
[whispers] so I can beat
your ass, you fucking liar."

373
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,671
- Okay. Okay. Done?
- Nope.

374
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,758
That was me
throwing the book at you.

375
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,720
You know there's no real
actual book, right?

376
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,781
[whispering] "So you left
a man dead in the street?"

377
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,349
- "We did not leave him dead."
- "And didn't call the police?"

378
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,476
"Because there was no time,
because we had to..."

379
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,770
"Brown man, you sound crazy."

380
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,748
{\an5}-"Don't say that."
-"You look like
a murderer to me."

381
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,750
- "Don't say that."
- "Look at your murderous beard

382
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,359
and your murderous brow."

383
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,819
You said you liked the beard.

384
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,113
Your beard looks like murder.

385
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,451
[cell phone vibrating]

386
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,163
- [Jibran] Don't.
- [Leilani] Hello?

387
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,789
Leilani, where the fuck
are you guys?

388
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,375
[Leilani] <i>I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>We bumped into an old friend.</i>

389
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,711
<i>- And...</i>
- Still at home.

390
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,088
We were going back and
forth with him several times.

391
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,232
Can you tell them
to grab some wine

392
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,608
We don't have any white
for Evonne.

393
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,552
Hey, can you pick up a bottle
of pinot? Grigio, not noir.

394
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,275
[Leilani] Sure,
we'll bring a bottle over.

395
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,847
Great. See you in a bit.

396
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:41,060
- What's going on?
- They're acting weird.

397
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,787
How you know
it's nice to meet me?

398
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,730
- What if I'm an asshole?
- [all laugh]

399
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,398
[Evonne] You're hilarious.

400
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,662
This silver milkshake container

401
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,581
is such a thing, you know?

402
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,225
They're always like,
"We made too much,

403
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,709
so here's the extra
and the container

404
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,794
that we made it in."

405
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,587
They can't just measure it out?

406
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,589
Huh? [chuckles]

407
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,966
They don't do that
with other stuff.

408
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,885
They're not like,
"Well, here's spaghetti

409
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,845
and here's some more
spaghetti on the side.

410
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,223
We made too much
for the spaghetti plate.

411
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:20,974
Here's soup.

412
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,851
We didn't wanna
measure it out early on,

413
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,269
and here we are."

414
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,146
[chuckling]
Like, what the fuck?

415
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,607
- It's crazy.
- It's so crazy.

416
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,944
Not the extra
milkshake container.

417
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,114
[cell phone vibrating]

418
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,372
[woman on phone]
<i>Is this Leilani Brooks?</i>

419
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,374
Who is this?

420
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,835
This is Detective Mary Martin
of the New Orleans PD.

421
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,253
Hi, Detective.

422
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,839
Ma'am, have you driven your
vehicle at any time today?

423
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,843
No, not-not today. Mmm-mmm.

424
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,237
Can I ask
where you are right now?

425
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,655
[whispers] She's asking
where I am right now.

426
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,013
- [whispers] Hang up.
- Home.

427
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,266
I'm home. Just chilling.

428
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,393
Are you saying that your
vehicle is at home as well?

429
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,769
- [whispers] Hang up.
- Yes!

430
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,356
If I just go to my window
right now, I should see...

431
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,483
Oh, my God.

432
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,861
Honey, wasn't our car
parked outside?

433
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:14,987
<i>This is crazy, Detective.</i>

434
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,698
I must have left the keys
in the ignition.

435
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,616
Can I get you two anything else?

436
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,344
[Detective Martin]
<i>Is that a waitress?</i>

437
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,287
{\an3}<i>Ma'am, where are you right now?</i>

438
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,455
We'll get the check.

439
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,543
We're so fucked!

440
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,961
[Leilani] No, we're not.

441
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,297
We just have to lay low

442
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,176
and keep a low profile
until this blows over.

443
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,594
I don't think...

444
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,471
Murders don't blow over, Lei.

445
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,556
Yes, they do.

446
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,225
If the police find the guy
that they're looking for.

447
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,019
You and me are the guy
they're looking for.

448
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,646
You know that song "Bad boys,
bad boys, whatcha gonna do"?

449
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,191
We're the bad boys.
What are we gonna do?

450
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,036
Yeah, I know that song
<i>Who Let the Dogs Out.</i>

451
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,045
And I'm always like,
who did let the dogs out?

452
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,989
Are we just talking
about songs that we remember?

453
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,031
You started it.

454
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,949
[cell phone chimes]

455
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,118
[gasps] Bicycle guy's phone
bing-bonged.

456
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,494
It just made a bing-bong sound.

457
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,747
Oh, don't touch it!
That's evidence!

458
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,498
I've been touching it
the whole time.

459
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,503
It's his calendar.
"Edie at Dragon's Den."

460
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,422
Wait. This Edie person

461
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,674
{\an3}obviously knows Bicycle, right?

462
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:21,845
{\an5}-What?
-So what if she knows
who wanted to kill Bicycle?

463
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,014
Oh. Okay, so you're suggesting

464
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,350
we actually go out there
and solve a...

465
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,310
Murder?
That's what you're suggesting?

466
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,270
Kinda.

467
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,730
Who the fuck do you think
we are?

468
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,897
Hobbs and Shaw?

469
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,149
We're not even a couple.

470
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,710
We couldn't figure out
our relationship.

471
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,237
You think that we're gonna
figure out who killed Bicycle?

472
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,200
We did break up, right?

473
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,328
Yeah.

474
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,621
Okay.

475
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,749
Jibran, all we need is a name.

476
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,334
We get Mustache's name,

477
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,962
we take it to the police,
and then we're in the clear.

478
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,130
We have ten minutes
to get there.

479
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,800
I don't think
this is a good idea at all.

480
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,678
I know you're scared, Ji,
and I'm scared, too.

481
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,012
But...

482
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,390
[both laughing]

483
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,016
What a sweet baby.

484
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,726
Woof-woof.

485
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:13,272
Can we try Edie?
See if she can help us?

486
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,149
Okay.

487
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,418
But if you're wrong and we spend

488
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,819
the rest of our lives
on death row,

489
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,102
I'm gonna be so pissed at you.

490
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,738
That's fair.

491
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,053
- [cell phone ringing]
- [whispering] Oh, my God.

492
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,495
It's the police.

493
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,039
- Don't answer it, ignore it.
- Right, right, right.

494
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,083
Right, right.

495
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,229
Why do they still have
the cigarette lighter?

496
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,338
Like, just make it
a power outlet

497
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,548
at this point, you know?

498
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,383
Like, who's like,
"I'm operating a vehicle,

499
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,986
I want to introduce fire
into this..."

500
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,554
Jibran, please.
No more milkshake monologues,

501
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,431
- okay?
- Right.

502
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,017
Excuse me, sir,
this isn't our destination.

503
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,936
[man chuckling]

504
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,939
- Are you Leon?
- [driver] Yes, sir.

505
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,567
- [man] Dope.
- [woman giggling]

506
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,029
[woman squeals]

507
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,488
You ordered a Lyft share.

508
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,241
I just have it set
on that option by default.

509
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,870
You're amazing.

510
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,788
[woman] Oh, you're amazing.

511
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,540
[man] But you're like
amazing-amazing.

512
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:14,767
[woman laughing] No, you are.

513
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,231
[man] I miss you
when we're together.

514
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,128
Like, right this second,

515
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,797
I am sitting next to you
and I miss you.

516
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,549
Aw, baby.

517
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,052
So, we're gonna go to this spot

518
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,303
and find this Edie person

519
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:29,181
- and then see what happens.
- [couple talking loudly]

520
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,975
How are we gonna know
who Edie is?

521
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,270
I don't know, we just go up
to her and ask if...

522
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:36,813
[couple continues yelling]

523
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,149
[man] I love you
more than I love my mom!

524
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,151
Shut the fuck up! Okay?

525
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,378
It's all kissy and huggy now,

526
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,529
but it all comes crashing down.

527
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,114
Okay?

528
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:53,663
[Jibran] All right, here we go
into the Dragon's Den.

529
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,415
[Leilani] It'll be fine.
We got this.

530
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,542
- [laughter and chatter]
- [hip-hop music playing]

531
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,837
It's not that bad.

532
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,798
We just gotta find her.

533
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,216
Okay. Yeah.

534
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,594
We just act super normal, okay?

535
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,346
Yeah.

536
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:12,349
We're normal.
Just normal people.

537
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,352
Coming to a bar.

538
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,818
We should not have come here.

539
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,737
You say that anytime
we go anywhere with people.

540
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,031
I was talking about
the sense of impending doom

541
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,283
that's growing in the pit
of my stomach right now!

542
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,744
I'm just saying.
If I never made plans,

543
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,037
we would never go anywhere.

544
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,706
Congratulations, you made
plans and this happened.

545
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,127
[cell phone chimes]

546
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,515
[Leilani] Okay, act normal.

547
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,201
- [Jibran] Love dancing.
- [Leilani] Whoo!

548
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,560
[Jibran] Normal-people shit.

549
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,445
[Leilani] That has to be her.

550
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,114
Okay, what do we do?

551
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,284
We should go over there, right?

552
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:29,759
Edie?

553
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,137
[softly] Edie.

554
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,930
- [both] Edie?
- [Edie shushes]

555
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,557
Stop talking.

556
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,392
Come with me.

557
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,356
Who are you? He sent you?

558
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,774
Yeah. Um...

559
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,194
Jibran, why don't you explain?

560
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:50,238
Um... There's sort of not
a good starting point.

561
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,574
He wants to be unprofessional
and send two strangers

562
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,784
instead of coming himself,
that's fine.

563
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,578
Let's just do this
and be done with it.

564
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,306
We just had a question,
and we wanted to know

565
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,390
if you know a guy
with a mustache?

566
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,474
[Jibran] We don't know
what's going on.

567
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:01,809
[Edie] Know a guy
with a mustache?

568
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,419
Okay, drop the act.
It's unbecoming.

569
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,463
There's a way to do this
that's respectable.

570
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,428
And this? This is not that.

571
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,305
[thud]

572
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,099
[both gasping]

573
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,232
Hand 'em over
and this can all end.

574
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,650
- What?
- Oh, no.

575
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,069
The pictures.
Give me the envelope.

576
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,762
- What pictures?
- [Jibran] Oh, no.

577
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,489
[Edie] You guys think
you're the only ones

578
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,366
who can dig up a little dirt?

579
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,661
I know who your boss is.

580
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,537
We don't have a boss.
We don't work together.

581
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,224
We don't know what pictures
you're talking about.

582
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,833
I'm a documentary filmmaker,
she works at an ad agency.

583
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,436
You remember that commercial
where the guy's a nerd

584
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,700
and then he uses this body wash

585
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,380
and all the girls, like,
wanna fuck him?

586
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,173
- That was her idea!
- That was my idea.

587
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,317
It was based on a true story.

588
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,860
This guy was really nerdy
at my college,

589
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,195
and he would smell good
and then I was like,

590
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,220
"I like him now."

591
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,948
She didn't like the way
a guy looked at college,

592
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,015
and then he smelled better
and then she fucked him!

593
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,101
But it's fine,
and we don't know anything!

594
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,602
Oh, yeah, right.

595
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,396
You showed up
at the designated time

596
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,605
and place of the exchange.

597
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,958
Yeah, because
of this guy's phone

598
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,042
and it bing-bonged your name!

599
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,502
We were just trying to go
to our friend's dinner party.

600
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,920
We have nothing
to do with anything.

601
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:14,281
We just answered
a bing-bong! [sobbing]

602
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,450
- Jibran. Mmm-mmm.
- Huh?

603
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,619
- She's not buying it.
- Oh, okay.

604
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,621
Let's take the guesswork
out here.

605
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,916
You said that
this gentleman's not your boss

606
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,560
- and you don't even know him?
- Uh-huh.

607
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:29,879
Oh. Why don't we just call him
and see what he has to say?

608
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,440
- Okay. Great.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, call him.

609
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,550
- [Edie] Mmm-hmm.
- [line ringing]

610
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,386
[cell phone ringing]

611
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,055
Oh, no.

612
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,141
It's not what you think.

613
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:43,435
Don't pee down my back
and tell me it's raining.

614
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,371
- Why would we do that?
- We would never do that.

615
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,647
If she pees down your back,
she's gonna say it's pee.

616
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,399
You think you can
fuck with a congressman

617
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,943
and get away with it?
You got another thing coming.

618
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,364
- Oh, no!
- Oh! What the fuck?

619
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,949
[Leilani gasping]

620
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,873
[man] Did you just tell them
I'm a congressman?

621
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,162
- [Edie] I...
- Come here. Real quick.

622
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,290
I'll be right back.

623
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,354
[Leilani whispering]
What's happening?

624
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,379
Can you get out?

625
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,048
[Jibran] This is fucking insane.

626
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,466
Take that damn mask off, Brett.

627
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,217
[Jibran] Are you okay?

628
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,738
[Brett] Well, it still doesn't
seem like a good idea.

629
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,013
My husband.

630
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,557
He was just about to get me
my pan. Right, hon?

631
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,516
[Brett] I thought we agreed

632
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,744
we weren't really
gonna do the pan.

633
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,187
You go get me my goddamn pan!

634
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,939
Hey, just to clarify, we're
not blackmailing anybody.

635
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,316
Excuse me, what is "the pan"?

636
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,861
[Edie] You tried to fuck us.
Now you're gonna get fucked.

637
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:36,505
[Jibran] Yeah, okay,
your premise is wrong

638
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:37,757
because we didn't
try to fuck you.

639
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,966
[Leilani] And we don't
wanna get fucked.

640
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,909
- [Jibran] No.
- [Edie] Mmm.

641
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,912
[clears throat]
I just love the smell

642
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,373
of sizzling bacon, don't you?

643
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,376
The only problem is the grease!

644
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,252
Y'all ever see
a bad grease burn?

645
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:55,048
It is remarkable the damage
a little hot oil can do.

646
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,842
I'm gonna give you both
a choice, okay?

647
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,304
All the grease in this pan,

648
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:04,349
or what's behind this door.

649
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,976
- What?
- [Edie] I said,

650
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,895
bacon grease

651
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,355
or door.

652
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,648
It's up to you.

653
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,275
And you're first,
Mr. Bing-Bong.

654
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,568
Take the grease.

655
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,613
Are you serious?
It's boiling hot grease.

656
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,296
And she could pour the grease
on my face!

657
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,075
Edie, may I ask a question?

658
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,285
Do I get to know
prior to making my decision

659
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,729
where you'll be pouring
the grease?

660
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,706
Um, yeah, it'll probably
most definitely be your face.

661
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,791
Thank you.

662
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,584
She said probably my face.

663
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,169
She's obviously
trying to scare you

664
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,921
into choosing something worse.

665
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,298
We're single now. I have to
go out into the dating world.

666
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,901
How do you think
I'm gonna do on Bumble?

667
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,135
Scars are super sexy.

668
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,344
Oh, you like burn scars?

669
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,596
After this, I'm gonna seek out
a guy with a burnt face.

670
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,848
You promise?

671
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,283
I'm gonna stalk
your Facebook so hard.

672
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,827
And if you're not
with a fucking burn victim,

673
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,519
I'm gonna be so very upset.

674
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,913
Well, thanks for reminding me
to block you.

675
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,257
I'm blocking you
right after this.

676
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,416
Let's make a decision here,
all right?

677
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,191
My husband and I
have plans tonight.

678
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,027
I'll go with not the grease.
I'll go with the door.

679
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,863
- Jibran!
- Door it is.

680
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,406
Tell him what they've won.

681
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,300
[Leilani] No, no, no, no!
Jibran, press your feet!

682
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,552
[Jibran] I am!
I'm planting my feet!

683
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,936
[Leilani] Stop it!
Leave him alone!

684
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:07,996
- [Edie] Open the door.
- [Brett] Yep.

685
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,755
Is it gonna shit on me?

686
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,339
- [clicks tongue]
- [horse neighs]

687
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:19,507
[Jibran screams]

688
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,593
- [grunts]
- [gasps]

689
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,303
[groans]

690
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,681
[stifled] Take the grease.

691
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,075
[Edie] It's your turn,
little missy.

692
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,739
The grease! The grease!
I take the grease!

693
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,770
A lady who knows what she wants.

694
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,355
[yelps] Ow!

695
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,108
No, no, no! No, no, no!

696
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,068
[panting]

697
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,654
No, no, no, no, no!

698
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,490
Okay, let's see...

699
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,633
- [Leilani shrieks]
- [screams]

700
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,201
[Brett screaming]

701
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,161
- [Jibran grunts]
- [Edie yelps]

702
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,505
[Leilani] Come on, help,
help, help me, help!

703
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,874
[Edie] Oh, God.
Honey, are you all right?

704
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,000
- [Brett] No!
- [grunts]

705
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,002
- [both scream]
- [Jibran grunting]

706
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,589
[yelling]

707
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,883
[both grunting]

708
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,889
Stay back! Stay back!
You stay back!

709
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,098
- You ready?
- Yeah.

710
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,017
One, two, three...

711
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,227
[Leilani screaming]

712
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,978
Where are you going?

713
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,357
- [screaming]
- [Brett] Whoa, honey!

714
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,151
[horse neighing]

715
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,736
[both panting]

716
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,434
[Leilani] What the fuck
just happened?

717
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,685
[Jibran] Dude, I said,
"One, two, three,"

718
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,461
and you, like, ran.

719
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,147
[Leilani] Yeah, 'cause that's
what you did in the alley.

720
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,211
You kinda set a precedent.

721
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,173
That's what I was going off of.

722
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,442
[Jibran] Yeah,
but I assumed you assumed

723
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:46,177
this time it would be like,
"One, two, three, attack."

724
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,720
[Leilani]
Why would I assume that?

725
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,098
[Jibran] Because we had
weapons? I don't know.

726
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,351
I never want to see
a horse again in my life.

727
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,937
[music playing faintly]

728
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,400
Thank you.

729
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,076
What, I look stupid?

730
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,078
Kinda like unicorn throw-up?

731
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,454
No, you look...

732
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,665
the opposite.

733
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:17,750
Unstupid.

734
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,549
Are you okay?

735
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:26,843
Yeah, I'm fine.

736
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,638
It just hurts a lot right
where the horse kicked me.

737
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,018
Uh... Come with me.

738
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,605
[Jibran] It looks okay? Ow.

739
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,689
- If you could...
- Sorry.

740
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,317
Stop tapping right where
the wound is.

741
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,860
I'm just trying to help.

742
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,069
Okay.

743
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,696
Come on, let's do this.

744
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,740
[whispering]
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

745
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,242
[groans]

746
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,536
I can't.

747
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,848
I'm just gonna wear this shirt
for the rest of my life.

748
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,749
[chuckles] No, you're not.
Stand up.

749
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,462
Uh, raise your arms.

750
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,423
[Jibran groans]

751
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,675
Okay. One, two, three.

752
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,270
Can I just say this is

753
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,855
the most batshit crazy
night ever?

754
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,440
You've never been
framed for murder

755
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:23,763
and tortured with bacon grease?

756
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,485
- [both chuckle]
- [groans]

757
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:26,694
[Leilani] Really?

758
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,987
- It just...
- Really?

759
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,990
- Just be so gentle. Just...
- Okay, I'm sorry.

760
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,455
- [groans and laughs]
- I didn't even touch you.

761
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,871
[scanner beeping]

762
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:48,925
[Jibran] I ordered us a Lyft.

763
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,719
[Leilani] I hope
you changed your settings.

764
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,316
You probably
don't remember this, but,

765
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,568
our first date,

766
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,404
that restaurant,

767
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,407
there was this couple
sitting next to us,

768
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,884
and they didn't talk the whole...

769
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,118
I remember them.

770
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:16,953
- You do?
- Yeah.

771
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,747
They didn't say anything
to each other the entire time.

772
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,041
You know, I think about them
all the time.

773
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,127
'Cause I was looking at them

774
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,920
like I never
want to be that couple,

775
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,047
you know, that runs
out of stuff to talk about.

776
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,775
But then the more
I think about them,

777
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,009
the more I'm like...

778
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,262
maybe they weren't miserable.

779
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,139
You know?
Maybe they were just

780
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,725
comfortable with each other.

781
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:48,276
So my theory about Edie
obviously didn't pan out.

782
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,278
Maybe you were right.

783
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,156
Maybe we should
just go to the cops.

784
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,117
I found something.

785
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,119
What?

786
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,248
The piece of paper that Edie
had with Bicycle's number?

787
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,958
It has an address on it, too.

788
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,418
What? When did you get this?

789
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,521
[Jibran] I was thinking,
maybe Mustache killed Bicycle

790
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,839
because of those pictures
that Edie was talking about.

791
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,799
So if we can
find those pictures,

792
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:12,884
figure out what they are,

793
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,260
maybe we can
exonerate ourselves.

794
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,554
Mustache was clearly
looking for something,

795
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,681
and Edie was very upset
about those pictures.

796
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,141
- It's a clue, right?
- Yeah!

797
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,309
I did a clue.

798
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,894
[both chuckle]

799
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,481
Should we go to that address?

800
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,942
You know this is
actually illegal, right?

801
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,028
Breaking into Bicycle's house?

802
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:33,863
Are you sure?

803
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,365
Are you?

804
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:37,450
Yeah.

805
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,994
- [car horn honks]
- [Jibran] Oh, that's our guy.

806
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:42,955
[grunts]

807
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,502
[Jibran] Oh, shit.

808
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:52,840
Shit.

809
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,527
[Leilani] He knows it's us,
he totally knows it's us.

810
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,011
[Jibran] Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

811
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,889
Shit, he's totally onto us.
He's onto us, he's onto us.

812
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,144
Oh, he's just a regular racist.

813
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,021
- Thank God.
- Let's go.

814
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,995
- [door rattles]
- [Leilani] Shit.

815
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:26,165
{\an3}-What?
- How are we gonna get up there?

816
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,750
- What? You just...
- [door rattles]

817
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,687
Did you think it was one
of those "Men Only" doors?

818
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:31,712
Sorry.

819
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,215
Maybe...

820
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:35,943
Maybe there's
one of those, like,

821
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,027
catwalk things around the side...

822
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,554
A "catwalk"? You mean
like for fashion shows?

823
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,180
Do you mean a fire escape?

824
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,473
[chuckling]

825
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,034
Why are you making jokes
right now? This is serious.

826
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,143
Okay. Okay.

827
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,646
Yeah. Break the glass. You go.

828
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,332
- Me go? I'm wearing heels.
- You're wearing heels.

829
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,191
Right. The icepick part
will stab the glass...

830
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,818
The "icepick part"?
Do you mean

831
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,278
the heel?

832
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,801
Yes, the pointy heel
part of the shoe

833
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,632
will break the glass.
It'll go right through it.

834
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:02,034
No, no. Use your shoulders.
Break the glass.

835
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,620
I just got kicked by a horse.

836
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:07,206
Can I take five minutes off
from, like, bashing myself?

837
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,833
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- Okay.

838
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,921
I'm just concerned the heel's
just gonna snap off.

839
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,566
No. Not if you do it
exactly perpendicular,

840
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,900
'cause it's a small
surface area. Pressure is...

841
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,676
Okay. How do you know that?

842
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,970
<i>MythBusters.</i>

843
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,723
So you do like reality shows.

844
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,100
Eh, it's more of a docuseries.

845
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,773
- Ow! Oops.
- [Jibran] Oh!

846
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:34,609
[Leilani] Ow!

847
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,819
[Jibran] I remember now.
That myth got busted.

848
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,803
[man on TV] <i>...reportedly</i>
<i>ran over the cyclist</i>

849
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:45,912
<i>multiple times.</i>

850
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,121
<i>Two witnesses at the scene</i>

851
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,248
<i>are currently being treated
for emotional distress.</i>

852
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,795
[Leilani whispering]
I think this is it.

853
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,554
What if there's someone
in there?

854
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,972
Looks empty.

855
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:06,950
Right, 'cause it's
probably empty

856
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,976
'cause it's Bicycle's
apartment and he's...

857
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,603
- Yeah.
- Dead.

858
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,313
Yeah, I was there, Jibran.

859
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,732
- Just try the window.
- Okay.

860
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,402
[grunts] It's locked.

861
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,571
Okay, your turn to kick it.

862
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,031
My shoes aren't made
for kicking.

863
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,866
Yeah, neither were mine.

864
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,410
In my defense,

865
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,055
the heel on the kicking shoe
didn't break off,

866
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,139
it was the heel
on the standing...

867
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,224
Jibran, I will throw you
down this catwalk.

868
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,416
I shouldn't have said that.
Sorry you broke your shoes.

869
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,460
Thank you,
they were my date shoes.

870
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:35,878
I didn't know
you had date shoes.

871
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,005
I got 'em for you.

872
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:44,637
Can you kick this in quietly,
please, since I'm barefoot?

873
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,681
Okay. Okay. Okay.

874
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,142
Okay, okay, here we go,
here we go.

875
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,395
[exhales sharply]

876
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,357
What? What are you doing?
Are you knocking?

877
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:59,235
No! I just wanna pull back
so I don't cut up my hand.

878
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,653
I make my living
with these hands.

879
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,751
- [Jibran shuddering]
- [gasps]

880
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,422
[Jibran] Shit.

881
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,595
[Leilani shushing]

882
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,475
[whispering] Help me,
help me, help me.

883
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:32,977
[shushing]

884
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,103
- [glass crunching]
- Ow.

885
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,397
- [objects thud]
- [shushing]

886
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,110
- You okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

887
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,070
- Okay.
- [shushing]

888
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,160
- [glass crunching]
- [both shushing]

889
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,411
[muffled music playing]

890
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,080
- Wait, you hear that?
- Hear what?

891
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,707
That.

892
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,752
There's, like, music happening.

893
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,922
- We should go in there.
- What? No.

894
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,716
What else are we gonna do?
Go back outside?

895
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:06,385
Okay, okay, okay.
We're just gonna take a peek.

896
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,221
[music continues]

897
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,016
[breathing deeply]

898
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,230
[music gets louder]

899
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:20,524
What is...

900
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,110
No, dude.
Shut the fuck up, okay?

901
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,504
I remember this shit
plain as day.

902
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,288
You were the one
that was fucking passed out.

903
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,948
Because I... No.

904
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,827
No, it was me,
it was Boyd Ashley. Ashley.

905
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,287
And I ate that day

906
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,914
'cause I was in a bulking phase.

907
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,583
[Leilani whispering] Who are
all these frat dudes?

908
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:40,002
[whispering] It's like
a roofie laboratory in there.

909
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,671
Those must be the photos
that Edie was talking about.

910
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,801
[Jibran] He left one of
the envelopes right there.

911
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,308
- We gotta go get it.
- Don't do it! [shushing]

912
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,806
All those fuckboys are in there.

913
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,325
I don't exactly know
what that means.

914
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,142
- Did I use it right?
- No, you didn't.

915
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,852
- What are fuckboys?
- I'm not having

916
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,813
this conversation right now
with you. Okay...

917
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,314
[shushing] No, no, no.

918
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,708
No, it's fine,
they can't hear us.

919
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,734
The music's too loud. Watch.

920
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,236
- [caws]
- [Jibran gasps]

921
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,821
[shushing]

922
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,949
We need to go in there,

923
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,325
grab one o' those envelopes,

924
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,469
and we figure out
what the fuck is goin' on.

925
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,912
But all the Abercrombie
& Fitch people will see us.

926
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,249
Okay, okay, okay,
we gotta, um...

927
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,300
We gotta come up
with a plan to distract them,

928
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,670
pull them out of there.

929
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,297
I got it! You stay here.

930
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,733
I'll gonna go out,
ring the doorbell.

931
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:27,818
I'm gonna say,
"Pizza delivery."

932
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,135
[door opens]

933
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,471
Oh, hey, wassup?

934
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,598
Hey, man, it's been a minute.

935
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,350
Who the fuck are you?

936
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,519
- It's her and me!
- Me and him!

937
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:39,728
[Jibran] Yes!

938
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:40,813
From, uh...

939
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,440
- [yelling]
- [boy screams]

940
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,193
- [cymbal crashing]
- [Leilani] Oh, no.

941
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,238
Get him, Jibran!
Fuck him up, Jibran!

942
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:52,616
- Fuck him up! Fuck him up!
- I'm trying! Stop saying that!

943
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,827
- [music continues]
- [boys chattering]

944
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,013
[Leilani] Tell me when
you want me to jump in.

945
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,998
- You want me to jump in?
- [choking]

946
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,459
This isn't Ultimate Fighting,
Jibran. You can't tap out.

947
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,963
[both grunting]

948
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,258
[Leilani] I got you!

949
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,470
- You're hitting me!
- You're in the way. Move!

950
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,054
[boy screams] Hey, help!

951
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:15,764
Take that!

952
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:18,976
Oh.

953
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,273
[panting]

954
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,858
[boy groaning]

955
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,610
[Leilani grunts]

956
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:28,777
[groans]

957
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,113
[boy] Fuck!

958
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,240
[continues groaning]

959
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,368
Who the fuck are you?

960
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,622
Who the fuck are we?

961
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,000
We're the people
who want some answers, bitch!

962
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,795
The bigger question is,
who the fuck are you?

963
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:49,298
What are you doing
in my fucking room?

964
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,675
Um... We're here...

965
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,721
Ow! Why would you do that?

966
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,309
Yeah... Why would we do that?

967
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,394
That's what you wanna know.

968
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,480
We're asking the questions.

969
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,482
And the answers to our questions

970
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,900
better be answers.

971
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,902
But the answers
to your questions

972
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,070
are gonna be my fists.

973
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:12,446
What?

974
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,365
- Ow!
- First of all, motherfucker,

975
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,283
- who do you work for?
- Yeah, motherfucker!

976
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,844
I don't know
what you're talking about.

977
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,638
Don't pee down my back
and tell me it's raining.

978
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:22,164
- Don't do it. Don't do it.
- We don't like it.

979
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,124
- Nope.
- 'Cause we know you're lying,

980
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,377
and then we have piss
on our backs.

981
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,045
I would never do that.

982
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,328
So tell us what we wanna know.

983
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,632
Yeah. Do you know Bicycle?

984
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,009
Do I know Bicycle?
What does that mean?

985
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,220
- Bicycle! Two wheels?
- Handlebars?

986
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:39,181
- Sometimes there's a basket.
- And sometimes there's spokes.

987
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:42,142
Yeah, ET rode one
and flew in it, bitch!

988
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:44,478
I know what a bicycle is.
Do you mean Tom?

989
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,564
I don't know.
Do we look like a bitch?

990
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,482
Fine. I work for Tom.

991
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,775
Uh, Tom rides a bicycle.

992
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,211
He's like a weird
environmentalist.

993
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:54,822
Is environmentalism weird
or is it absolutely necessary?

994
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,949
I recycle everything!

995
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:58,510
Yeah. Sometimes
she'll try and recycle

996
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,910
eggshells and banana peels,

997
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,912
and I'll be like,
"That's more compost."

998
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,498
Okay, focus back on me,
little Brett Kavanaugh.

999
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,041
What do you do for Tom?

1000
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,835
[boy] Uh... Uh...
I'm not supposed to say.

1001
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,753
Shut the fuck up and talk,
Chug-A-Lug Chuck!

1002
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,106
How am I supposed
to shut the fuck up

1003
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,090
and talk at the same time?
That's impossible!

1004
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:15,134
- Figure that shit out!
- [Jibran] Figure it out.

1005
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,803
Please, all we do is, we stuff
these envelopes. Okay?

1006
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:19,333
And then we have to deliver them

1007
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:21,348
- to these, like, rich people.
- What rich people?

1008
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,475
I don't... I don't know, okay?

1009
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,978
Uh, he works
at this, like, uh, club.

1010
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,229
And these people are...

1011
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,582
These people
are dangerous, okay?

1012
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,150
You don't want to fuck
with these people, okay?

1013
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,862
Ow! I have been
100% cooperating!

1014
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,780
I don't like your tone,
Date Rape McGee.

1015
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,157
[bottle clinks]

1016
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,075
- [panting]
- [music continues]

1017
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,413
So tell us where the fuck
this club is.

1018
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:46,290
I don't know.
Because they don't tell us.

1019
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:47,559
They said the less that we know,

1020
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,583
the better, okay?

1021
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,377
They only contact him
on his phone.

1022
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,217
Oh, fuck, Jesus!
Please help, help, please!

1023
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,219
Intruders, intruders! Help!

1024
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,929
- Oh!
- [Mustache] Hi, Steve.

1025
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:02,936
- [Steve] Please, don't...
- [silenced gunshot]

1026
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:04,993
[whispering]
We gotta get out of here.

1027
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,477
Come on, this way.

1028
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,854
[music continues]

1029
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,882
- [cell phone vibrating]
- Shit.

1030
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:41,970
- [cell phone beeps]
- Hello?

1031
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,974
Yeah. I took care
of the problem.

1032
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,439
Yeah, he's <i>quod mortem.</i>

1033
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:54,983
Mmm-hmm.

1034
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,237
I understand.

1035
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,073
Yeah.

1036
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,701
Yeah, I'll make sure
it goes smoothly tonight.

1037
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,496
You have nothing
to worry about, okay?

1038
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:08,914
Hang on a second.

1039
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,793
[music continues]

1040
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:16,046
[Leilani gasping]

1041
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,548
Go, go, go, go, go.

1042
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:23,470
[music stops]

1043
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,098
[Mustache] I can hear you
better now. Go ahead.

1044
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,353
[ladder creaking]

1045
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,617
[indistinct chatter]

1046
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,164
I just saw two people
get murdered.

1047
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:53,876
Until yesterday, I had seen
zero people get murdered.

1048
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,128
That could've easily been us.

1049
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,172
Oh, my God, there's blood
on my knuckles.

1050
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,466
I left my DNA
at the crime scene.

1051
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:03,218
Shit, I left my fingerprints
on Date Rape's face.

1052
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,888
And now I feel really bad
for calling him Date Rape.

1053
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:08,891
The police are gonna think
we killed him, too.

1054
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:11,018
They're gonna think
we're, like, serial killers.

1055
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,645
We gotta figure this shit out.

1056
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,648
Open it. Open it.

1057
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:24,656
[Jibran] What is this?

1058
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,745
What is this?

1059
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,415
"Dear Mrs. Burrows,
There are many.

1060
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:34,541
We know you are one."

1061
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,834
What else? What else?

1062
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,548
That-That's it.

1063
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,760
This is like <i>The Amazing Race,</i>
but with dead people.

1064
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:46,512
Wait.

1065
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,406
We have to get
into Bicycle's phone.

1066
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,890
He said this is how
they contact him.

1067
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,518
I'm gonna start guessing
passwords. Important dates.

1068
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,853
1-4-9-2. Nope.

1069
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,730
- 1-7-7-6. Nope.
- Ugh.

1070
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:57,814
What, are you gonna guess

1071
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,733
every impressive date
in history? Stop.

1072
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,527
Right. He was a bicycle fan.

1073
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,046
What was the year
that Lance Armstrong

1074
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,780
won his first Tour de France?

1075
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,115
- 1-9...
- Stop, stop, stop.

1076
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,718
Okay? You're gonna lock us
out of the phone

1077
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:10,662
and then we're literally
gonna have nothing else.

1078
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:11,954
Okay.

1079
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,958
I know who can get us
into the phone.

1080
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,460
- Who?
- Keith.

1081
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,588
- Keith?
- He's our IT guy, okay?

1082
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,091
{\an5}-Oh, really?
-And he's a genius
at this type of stuff.

1083
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,593
Oh, he's a genius? Wow!

1084
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,804
You guys are so lucky
to have a genius

1085
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,556
working at your office
as the IT guy.

1086
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,839
I'm not trying to hype him up.

1087
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,809
But if anybody can do it,
he can do it.

1088
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:36,478
Errol Morris is a genius.
JK Rowling is a genius.

1089
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,313
You could even say
Lil Wayne is a genius.

1090
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,982
But Keith? Fucking Keith?

1091
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,751
What is your deal with him?
Why are you so...

1092
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,360
I don't like the way
he looks at you.

1093
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,571
He doesn't look at me
like anything.

1094
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,073
Well, then...

1095
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,535
I don't like the way
you look at him.

1096
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:01,086
Look, do you wanna
get into this phone or not?

1097
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:03,130
'Cause this could be
our only chance.

1098
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,865
All right. We're gonna
go in for five minutes,

1099
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:14,600
get the phone unlocked,
and we are leaving.

1100
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:15,684
No, wait.

1101
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:16,852
We can't just go in there

1102
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,812
and ask Keith
to hack into a random phone.

1103
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:20,873
'Cause he's really ethical
about this kind of stuff.

1104
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:23,900
Oh, he's really ethical,
but he's okay stealing comedy?

1105
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,611
This guy's a real question mark.

1106
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:27,738
Help me come up
with something believable.

1107
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,492
- [music playing softly]
- [Bobby] Everyone!

1108
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,161
Look who finally showed up.

1109
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:37,414
- About fucking time! Hey.
- [all greeting]

1110
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:39,124
[Jibran] Sorry we're so late.

1111
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,835
- Oh, hey, Keith is here.
- Hi.

1112
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:44,880
Oh, my God,
this all looks so good.

1113
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:47,924
Oh, Reya, you have
outdone yourself!

1114
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,343
Oh, my God!

1115
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,345
Did you try this, guys?

1116
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:54,973
Oh, my God, that is to die for!

1117
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:57,225
These are some of the best...
Things we've had.

1118
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,477
Whoa, it's so fresh!

1119
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,038
[Jibran] So these are red,
there's green ones.

1120
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:01,563
What other pepper colors
do you got?

1121
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:02,564
There's also yellow.

1122
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:04,650
I wasn't asking you, Keith.
I was asking Reya.

1123
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,109
Are you guys okay?

1124
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,486
- Us?
- So good.

1125
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:09,213
- We're fucking great.
- A-OK. One hundred.

1126
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,864
And what the fuck
are you wearing?

1127
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:12,008
What the fuck am I wearing?

1128
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,450
What the fuck
are you wearing, dude?

1129
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:15,243
Turtleneck.

1130
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,371
Is that blood on your face?

1131
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,831
And it's a big disgrace.

1132
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,126
We actually do have some news.

1133
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,378
Um...

1134
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,421
- Jibran, tell them.
- We box now.

1135
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,299
[Reya] Boxing?

1136
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:32,302
We actually just took a class
before we came here.

1137
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:36,223
And Jibran boxed outside
of his weight class.

1138
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,058
It was incredible.

1139
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,894
I'm what they call a "bleeder"
in the boxing biz.

1140
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,730
They actually said I could
never be a professional boxer

1141
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,440
because of how much I bleed.

1142
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:49,111
So the reason you were late
was because you were boxing?

1143
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:50,654
[Leilani] Yeah! [chuckles]

1144
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,155
Uh...

1145
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,574
Oh, my God,
I have such a good idea!

1146
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,410
Do you guys wanna see

1147
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,453
a video of Jibran
getting knocked out?

1148
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,217
- [overlapping chatter]
- Yeah, definitely.

1149
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:02,290
[Leilani] Pull out
your phone, honey.

1150
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,461
[Jibran] Okay.

1151
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:08,964
What?

1152
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:12,884
I can't remember my passcode
to my phone.

1153
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,095
Oh, my God! Do you think that

1154
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,864
it's all of the hits
that you took to your head

1155
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:17,889
while boxing?

1156
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:21,393
Is it a new passcode?

1157
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:23,145
No, Keith,
it's not a new passcode!

1158
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:24,813
Good question, though.

1159
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:28,442
Oh, my God!
Do I have a brain... brain...

1160
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,402
brain injury?

1161
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:31,945
Call your doctor.

1162
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,531
Yeah, I'll call Doctor...

1163
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:36,116
[gasps] You don't
remember his name!

1164
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,343
[Jibran] His name
is in the phone,

1165
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,618
but I can't get into the phone,

1166
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,370
- so I can't even google it!
- How do...

1167
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:43,331
If only we could unlock
the phone. Oh, no...

1168
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,000
- It's okay.
- [both] Huh?

1169
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,543
I can get into your phone.

1170
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,961
Oh, you don't have to do that.

1171
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:50,053
- I wanna help.
- Okay, let's do it right now!

1172
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,763
[scoffs] This thing's a wreck.
You need a new phone, man.

1173
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,514
You need a new phone.

1174
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,099
- What?
- What?

1175
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:02,934
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

1176
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,019
Okay.

1177
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,997
I'm just running
the rainbow tables here,

1178
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,314
about halfway through.

1179
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,459
I was actually gonna run
a brute-force algorithm,

1180
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,609
but this'll be a lot faster.

1181
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:12,360
It'll be faster, yeah.
Good call.

1182
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:13,945

01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,676
[number caller] <i>Thirty-four.</i>

1354
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:40,928
Do we want
our names to be called?

1355
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:42,430
I don't know.
I don't think so.

1356
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:45,600
<i>And the final number is...</i>

1357
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:49,854
<i>Ninety-nine.</i>

1358
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:53,650
<i>Let the ceremony begin.</i>

1359
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,735
[upbeat new age music playing]

1360
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,447
- Oh, no, that's not the vibe.
- Mmm-hmm.

1361
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:05,036
[Leilani] What is happening?

1362
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,509
I think they're gonna, um...

1363
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:23,388
Yeah, that's what
I thought was gonna happen.

1364
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:27,725
No, they didn't.

1365
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:30,228
- Uh, yes, they did.
- Yes, they did.

1366
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,732
You know, I'm actually
not hating this.

1367
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:35,983
Yeah, you've made your, um,

1368
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:37,527
thoughts on orgies quite clear.

1369
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:39,370
Do you think they're gonna
call more numbers?

1370
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:44,659
- This is spontaneous.
- This is not spontaneous!

1371
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:46,702
I bet all these people had it
on their Google Cal.

1372
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:47,870
[man shushes]

1373
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,456
[music continues]

1374
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,336
[Red Robe Man
in normal voice] Stop!

1375
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:56,421
[music stops]

1376
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,464
Go away!

1377
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:01,843
[low murmuring]

1378
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,806
I love that they actually
respect the word "stop."

1379
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:15,064
There is a traitor

1380
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,774
amongst us.

1381
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:20,903
A worker has violated

1382
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,239
the most sacred code
of Sacrarium.

1383
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:27,452
And for this,
he has paid a hefty price.

1384
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:30,663
He is <i>quod mortem.</i>

1385
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,391
- [all murmuring]
- [Leilani] Jibran, my God.

1386
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,167
They hired Mustache
to kill Bicycle.

1387
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:36,711
Oh, shit.

1388
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:37,795
[Red Robe Man] Silence!

1389
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:38,755
[Jibran] We should
get out of here.

1390
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,799
I have just learned
that this man's barcode

1391
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:45,762
has been used
to enter Sacrarium tonight.

1392
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:47,555
[Jibran quietly] It's okay.

1393
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:51,309
We have imposters in our ranks.

1394
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:52,477
[all gasp]

1395
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:55,229
Oh, no, imposters. That sucks.

1396
01:02:55,646 --> 01:02:59,317
We must all reveal
our true faces,

1397
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,695
so that this imposter
may be rooted out

1398
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,489
and dealt with.

1399
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,116
On my count of three,

1400
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:09,786
unmask yourselves.

1401
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:11,245
One...

1402
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,140
- Okay, okay, fuck, fuck.
- Are we gonna do it?

1403
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:14,266
Everyone's gonna
take their mask off.

1404
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,291
[Red Robe Man] Two...

1405
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:17,084
[Jibran] Fuck, fuck,
we have to do it.

1406
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,377
If everybody else is doing it.

1407
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:19,462
Three!

1408
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:24,967
Oh, fuck.

1409
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,844
[Red Robe Man]
A true member knows,

1410
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:29,263
you never take off your mask.

1411
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:31,766
[Edie gasps] Oh, my God,
that's them.

1412
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:33,601
Go! Go get 'em!

1413
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:34,844
- Oh, God.
- [all] We are one.

1414
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:36,854
We are Sacrarium.

1415
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:39,023
[Red Robe Man]
Your burnt offerings

1416
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:41,234
shall be made to the gods,

1417
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,986
- and it shall replenish them.
- Oh! No! Stop! I'm a bleeder!

1418
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,446
[Jibran and Leilani screaming]

1419
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:46,531
[alarm blaring]

1420
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:47,907
[automated male voice]
<i>Evacuate.</i>

1421
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,076
<i>Evacuate.</i>

1422
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:51,869
[attendees clamoring]

1423
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:53,204
<i>Evacuate.</i>

1424
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:56,207
What the fuck?

1425
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:04,549
What the fuck?
All the fuck people left.

1426
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:06,217
Are we having the same dream?

1427
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,177
[alarm continues blaring]

1428
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:10,137
- Um...
- Let's go.

1429
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:12,115
- [officer 1] Police!
- [officer 2] Go, go, go, go!

1430
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:14,267
- [Leilani] Oh, my God.
- [officer 2] Go, go, go, go!

1431
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:17,311
- Freeze! Hands in the air!
- [Jibran] Whoa. Whoa.

1432
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:18,646
[officer 2] Higher!

1433
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:21,148
- Higher!
- This is as high as they go.

1434
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:25,420
[officer on radio]
<i>Dispatch, that's a 10-95.</i>

1435
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:27,084
<i>They're in custody.
We're on our way back.</i>

1436
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:28,990
[blinker clicking]

1437
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:46,340
Detective Martin
will be here shortly.

1438
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,932
It's over. We're done.

1439
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:58,019
I know.

1440
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,272
I need to tell you something.

1441
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:03,983
Yeah?

1442
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:07,737
You remember when you

1443
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:10,448
went out of town
for Ben's bachelor party?

1444
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:12,617
You ate all the peanut brittle.

1445
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:13,993
No.

1446
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:15,870
Yeah.

1447
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:18,789
I snuck into your office

1448
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:20,875
and I watched your documentary.

1449
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:23,669
- You did what?
- I know, I'm sorry.

1450
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,297
But can I just say that

1451
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:29,467
it was really good.

1452
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:34,631
Why didn't you say something?

1453
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:36,933
Jibran, honestly, sometimes...

1454
01:05:38,142 --> 01:05:40,311
I feel like you don't care
what I think.

1455
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:43,689
[chuckles lightly]

1456
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,483
I care so much
about what you think.

1457
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,127
That's why I didn't
wanna show it to you.

1458
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:48,903
I was afraid
you wouldn't like it.

1459
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,252
You know, you've had
your life figured out

1460
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,782
since the moment we met.

1461
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:56,702
I always felt like you could
do so much better than me.

1462
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:02,625
You know, honestly, I...

1463
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:05,544
I feel like I don't have
anything figured out.

1464
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,254
Like, zero.

1465
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:10,466
But I was so obsessed

1466
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:11,926
with what
everybody else thought,

1467
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:14,971
except the one person
that I care about the most.

1468
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:20,393
I just want you to be happy.

1469
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:24,605
I want you to be happy, too.

1470
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:32,613
We'll still be friends,
laying out at the trial.

1471
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,116
Oh, no, I took a deal.

1472
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:36,659
- What?
- Nobody told you?

1473
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:38,035
[both chuckle]

1474
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:39,846
Wait, but I thought
we'd have the same lawyer.

1475
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:41,622
I'm a rat all day.

1476
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:43,374
- It's done?
- [chuckles] Yeah, it's done.

1477
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:44,291
Ah, shit.

1478
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:47,211
I like them. I don't think
they should break up.

1479
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:49,755
Relationships are
a motherfucker.

1480
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:51,215
Yeah.

1481
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:15,573
We've been looking for you
all over this city.

1482
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:20,619
You guys are key witnesses
on a homicide,

1483
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,329
and the suspect
is still on the loose.

1484
01:07:24,665 --> 01:07:25,666
What?

1485
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,269
We've been trying
to track you down all night

1486
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:28,419
to make sure you were safe.

1487
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:30,188
We tried calling your phone
several times.

1488
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:31,252
[Leilani] Wait, I'm sorry.

1489
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:33,382
You don't think
we're the murderers?

1490
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:34,675
No.

1491
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:36,010
There were traffic cameras

1492
01:07:36,093 --> 01:07:37,154
that caught the entire pursuit.

1493
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:38,512
- Uh-huh.
- I can't believe this.

1494
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:39,865
We're trying to
ID the individual

1495
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,348
who carjacked your vehicle.

1496
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:44,143
We know that he's responsible
for this incident as well as

1497
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:46,854
multiple homicides
at the St. Charles Apartments.

1498
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:49,356
- A bunch of dead frat guys.
- Uh... Okay...

1499
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:51,984
Just to be clear,

1500
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:57,406
we are not suspects
in a murder/homicide.

1501
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,370
- You know we didn't do this.
- We didn't do it.

1502
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:01,053
- And you know it.
- Of course you didn't do it.

1503
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,578
Why would two civilians

1504
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:04,622
violently murder a man
they've never even met?

1505
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:07,291
- Like, why would we...
- [laughter]

1506
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:09,668
- It doesn't make sense.
- It doesn't make any sense.

1507
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:11,587
Oh, my God!

1508
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:12,838
[laughs] That's right.

1509
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,091
I promise I have
never killed anyone.

1510
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:17,635
And I promise to never
kill anyone, Scout's honor.

1511
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:19,428
- Never. Never kill anybody.
- Never kill.

1512
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:22,348
Have I thought about killing
people? Like Jibran?

1513
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:23,974
All the time.
But I would never...

1514
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,601
- But that's in a normal way!
- No...

1515
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:27,269
She would never act on it.

1516
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:28,393
In the way where I'm like,

1517
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:30,314
"I will kill you,
I will wring your neck!"

1518
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:31,649
But not in the real murder way.

1519
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:32,733
[Leilani] Not physically.

1520
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:34,318
I have rolled through stop signs

1521
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:35,736
almost every day of my life,

1522
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:38,072
but not in a dangerous way.
[laughing]

1523
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:41,367
I used to sell, uh,
my uncle's edibles.

1524
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,494
He was always like,
"It's legal in Amsterdam."

1525
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:45,055
He could not point
to Amsterdam on a map, but...

1526
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,872
She did not sell them
in Amsterdam.

1527
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,165
She did sell them here.

1528
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:50,918
But to help people get high.

1529
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:53,003
Just glaucoma
and things like that.

1530
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,588
[Jibran] Yes, mostly.
She did make

1531
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:56,924
some money at a time
when we did need some money.

1532
01:08:57,007 --> 01:08:59,260
We needed to pay some bills.
Wait, I'm sorry.

1533
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:03,264
So, did you guys catch
the... the cult people?

1534
01:09:03,347 --> 01:09:04,783
[Jibran] The cult in
the theater with the people

1535
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:06,934
with the masks
and everybody was... sex.

1536
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:08,185
The lucky people had sex.

1537
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:09,538
[Jibran] They would go
on the round bed...

1538
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:10,602
[Leilani] There was music.

1539
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:12,666
- Yeah, they were having sex.
- In a very public place.

1540
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:14,024
Some people
were putting in work.

1541
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:15,151
There was a big round bed.

1542
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:16,527
Some people got right to it.

1543
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:18,988
They were... I will agree
they were putting in work.

1544
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,656
[Leilani] Yeah,
we saw all of that.

1545
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:23,868
And let me tell you, sis,
it was a sight.

1546
01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:25,744
That's super helpful,

1547
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,872
but we know all about Sacrarium.

1548
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:29,141
We've been tracking them
for months,

1549
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,350
and the raid tonight
was supposed to

1550
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:31,458
shut them down for good,

1551
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:33,544
but somebody tipped them off
that we were coming.

1552
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,088
Look,

1553
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:39,008
you guys witnessed
some horrific things.

1554
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:41,319
Eventually, we're gonna
need your statements,

1555
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:43,345
but I really think that you two

1556
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:45,556
would benefit from some sleep.

1557
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,909
So why don't you come back
first thing in the morning

1558
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:49,852
and we'll get
your statements then.

1559
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:52,271
One of our guys out back
will take you home.

1560
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:53,665
And we'll keep an eye
on your place

1561
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:56,400
to make sure you're safe until
the suspect is apprehended.

1562
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:57,943
Thank you so much.

1563
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,296
This has been a good experience.

1564
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,672
- [Detective Martin] I hope so.
- Thank you for everything.

1565
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:02,382
Is there a comment card?
'Cause I'm doing five.

1566
01:10:02,406 --> 01:10:03,407
Fives down the line.

1567
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:05,250
[Leilani] Yeah, I would love
to just... Okay?

1568
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:17,546
So, that's it? [scoffs]

1569
01:10:17,796 --> 01:10:21,050
We just go back
to our normal lives?

1570
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:22,635
Like nothing happened?

1571
01:10:23,844 --> 01:10:25,221
I guess so.

1572
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:26,722
[chuckles]

1573
01:10:31,685 --> 01:10:32,686
Um...

1574
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:36,649
I could sleep
on the couch tonight.

1575
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:39,777
Oh, no, no, no. We can...
We can trade off.

1576
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:42,112
No, you should have the bed.

1577
01:10:49,828 --> 01:10:51,413
This is crazy.
I know we didn't, like,

1578
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:53,624
solve the crime or whatever,

1579
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:55,542
but we got really close.

1580
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,294
I'm proud of us.

1581
01:10:58,295 --> 01:11:00,339
Hey, not bad
for a couple rookies.

1582
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:03,968
You know, the one thing
I can't figure out is,

1583
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:06,387
who called the cops?

1584
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:07,888
[driver] I did.

1585
01:11:10,724 --> 01:11:12,059
Remember me?

1586
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:14,561
How did you get in this car?

1587
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:15,896
I told you I was a cop.

1588
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:18,524
I've been on the force
for about 13 years.

1589
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:20,776
I'm actually kind of
a big deal over there.

1590
01:11:21,485 --> 01:11:23,904
And you're a member
of the sex cult, too?

1591
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:25,257
[Mustache] Nah, they pay me

1592
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:26,561
to keep 'em safe
from the police.

1593
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:29,368
Wait, so you were protecting
the sex cult

1594
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:32,454
and also blackmailing
its members?

1595
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:34,164
As a matter of fact, I was.

1596
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:36,500
Do you know how much
this fucking city pays me?

1597
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:39,128
I put my life on the line
every single day

1598
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:41,255
and the government
tosses pennies at me.

1599
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:43,215
But you know what is fucked up?

1600
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:46,468
That guy on the bicycle?

1601
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,846
The one I ran over
several times with your car?

1602
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:50,073
- I remember. You remember?
- Mmm-hmm.

1603
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:51,181
Yeah, we remember.

1604
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:52,683
That was my friend.

1605
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:57,688
Me and him, we come up with
the blackmail-the-cult scheme.

1606
01:11:58,272 --> 01:12:01,692
But he got too greedy.
Stopped giving me my full cut.

1607
01:12:01,775 --> 01:12:03,211
And then, against
my better judgment,

1608
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:05,654
he brought those
ignorant frat boys onboard.

1609
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:08,574
Sir, if I may,
we don't know anything,

1610
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:10,409
and we have terrible memories.

1611
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:12,536
So please just let us go,
you can trust us.

1612
01:12:12,619 --> 01:12:14,830
Lady, I don't trust anyone.
Here's a little tip:

1613
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:17,750
The world is out to get you.

1614
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:20,627
The only one who's got your back

1615
01:12:20,794 --> 01:12:21,879
is you.

1616
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:24,840
- You're wrong.
- That's not true.

1617
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:28,510
I trusted someone. One person.

1618
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:31,138
Siobhan.

1619
01:12:31,555 --> 01:12:33,849
I will never trust anyone again.

1620
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:35,893
Never.

1621
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:38,437
You come into this world alone

1622
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,606
and you leave this world alone.

1623
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:42,691
Which is what you two
are about to find out.

1624
01:12:54,244 --> 01:12:55,662
[grunts] Look,

1625
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:57,599
I'm sorry
I have to kill you guys.

1626
01:12:57,623 --> 01:13:00,793
You seem like a nice, though
somewhat annoying couple.

1627
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:02,628
But if it makes you feel
any better,

1628
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,088
I will get over it.

1629
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:05,672
You don't have to do this, okay?

1630
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:07,549
You're not a killer,
you're a good person.

1631
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:10,219
- I can see it in your eyes.
- Your eyes are so kind.

1632
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:11,553
They're luminous.

1633
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:14,348
Do you know how many people
I have killed today?

1634
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:16,475
Uh... I would say
you've killed, like,

1635
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:18,352
exactly the right number
of people.

1636
01:13:18,435 --> 01:13:19,520
I wouldn't add to it,

1637
01:13:19,686 --> 01:13:21,355
'cause right now,
the number of people

1638
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:24,024
you've killed is impressive,
but not, like, worrying.

1639
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:25,418
Also, you killed a guy
on a bicycle

1640
01:13:25,442 --> 01:13:26,610
and a bunch of frat boys.

1641
01:13:26,693 --> 01:13:27,837
[nervously] Who's kidding who?

1642
01:13:27,861 --> 01:13:29,101
You're practically a folk hero.

1643
01:13:29,154 --> 01:13:30,739
That was a rhetorical question.

1644
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:33,075
Never too late to change.

1645
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:35,119
Maybe if you do,
you can find a new Siobhan.

1646
01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:37,996
Did I say that you could talk
about Siobhan?

1647
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,391
I thought you were sharing
and thought

1648
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:40,767
it was an open invitation,
but I wasn't...

1649
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:42,060
Listen,
Siobhan is clearly a tramp.

1650
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:43,127
You, too!

1651
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:45,421
Take her name out of your mouth!

1652
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:48,173
I will never say
the name Siobhaaa again.

1653
01:13:48,298 --> 01:13:49,526
She's dead to me.
I don't even...

1654
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:50,610
- [gags]
- [Jibran] She sucks.

1655
01:13:50,634 --> 01:13:51,635
[Mustache] Shut up.

1656
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:56,780
[whispers]
He clearly isn't over Siobhan.

1657
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:01,395
Turn around. Put your hands
behind your back.

1658
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:05,232
You lay a hand on her
and I'll kick your ass, dude.

1659
01:14:06,733 --> 01:14:08,485
- [Mustache] Turn around.
- Yes, sir.

1660
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:10,446
[winces]

1661
01:14:10,904 --> 01:14:12,739
They have traffic cam footage
of you, man.

1662
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:14,158
You're so fucked.

1663
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:15,409
Nah, I saw it.

1664
01:14:15,492 --> 01:14:16,660
It's very grainy.

1665
01:14:16,743 --> 01:14:19,037
It's like, uh, Bigfoot footage.

1666
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:23,726
Jibran, we can't just sit here
waiting to be killed, okay?

1667
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:24,978
- We need to do something.
- Okay.

1668
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:26,962
- Help me figure something out.
- Okay, okay.

1669
01:14:27,045 --> 01:14:29,923
Um... Here,
uh, loosen my ties.

1670
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:32,026
- Can you do it?
- I can barely reach it.

1671
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:34,094
[groans] Okay,
it's just getting tighter. Ow.

1672
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:35,471
I'm sorry. Okay, try me.

1673
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:37,181
- Is it working?
- No. Oh, fuck!

1674
01:14:37,347 --> 01:14:38,747
[Jibran] I'm gonna try
kicking this.

1675
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:40,767
[grunts]

1676
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:42,019
Oh, shit.

1677
01:14:42,102 --> 01:14:44,146
[grunts] I wish I was
wearing your date shoes.

1678
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:46,148
Jibran, the lighter!
The cigarette lighter!

1679
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:48,358
That's what's it there for!
Go, go.

1680
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:50,777
- [Leilani grunts]
- Yeah, you can do it.

1681
01:14:52,404 --> 01:14:53,989
[straining]

1682
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:56,617
Okay, that's kind of hot.

1683
01:14:58,702 --> 01:14:59,745
Does he see us?

1684
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:01,246
My God,
he's laying down plastic.

1685
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,331
Oh, shit, shit.

1686
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:03,916
- Has it popped out yet?
- No.

1687
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:06,210
- [Jibran] What about now?
- Okay. Okay.

1688
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:08,045
Come on. Hurry up.

1689
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,510
Get it, get it, get it.
Get it, get it, get it.

1690
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:12,549
- [Leilani] Close your eyes.
- Come on, come on.

1691
01:15:13,258 --> 01:15:15,385
[screams]
Get the plastic, not my hands!

1692
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:19,389
[Jibran screams]

1693
01:15:20,807 --> 01:15:22,434
Drop it, drop it.
Ow! Ahh!

1694
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,662
- I had it in my mouth, okay?
- Yeah, but you didn't have

1695
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:26,246
- the hot end in your mouth.
- Hurry up!

1696
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:28,541
Hold, up, hold up,
he's looking at us.

1697
01:15:28,565 --> 01:15:29,942
He's looking at us. Hold on.

1698
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:33,904
Okay, put it back.
Put it back. Put it back.

1699
01:15:36,156 --> 01:15:37,491
[Mustache] Out of the car.

1700
01:15:38,742 --> 01:15:41,537
They're gonna get you.
They know you drove us.

1701
01:15:41,828 --> 01:15:43,830
[Mustache] No, they're
not gonna suspect me.

1702
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:45,707
When I drove you guys
to your apartment,

1703
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:48,252
the real killer
jumped out of the bushes

1704
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:49,836
and hit me over the head!

1705
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:52,130
When I woke up, there I was,

1706
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:54,091
tied up in the back
of my own squad car

1707
01:15:54,174 --> 01:15:56,093
with you guys
here at the marina.

1708
01:15:58,053 --> 01:15:59,221
Watch your step.

1709
01:16:01,181 --> 01:16:04,017
And then the killer made us
get on the boat.

1710
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:06,478
That's right. All three of us.

1711
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:08,564
And you remember
what happened next.

1712
01:16:09,189 --> 01:16:11,441
He made us all kneel down.
Go ahead.

1713
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:15,362
I jumped up
and tried to save you guys.

1714
01:16:15,445 --> 01:16:17,656
And in the scuffle, I was shot.

1715
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:20,450
I wasn't mortally wounded,
but I had to watch in horror

1716
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:22,578
as the masked killer

1717
01:16:22,869 --> 01:16:25,038
executed you both with my gun.

1718
01:16:25,122 --> 01:16:26,498
Anyway,
let's get this over with.

1719
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:28,917
Eenie...

1720
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:30,335
No.

1721
01:16:30,627 --> 01:16:31,628
Eenie,

1722
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:34,089
meenie,

1723
01:16:34,798 --> 01:16:35,799
miney...

1724
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:37,467
[both grunting]

1725
01:16:45,809 --> 01:16:46,977
[Jibran] Hey, Mustache.

1726
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:50,814
[both grunting]

1727
01:16:56,486 --> 01:16:57,779
[Leilani] Okay, okay.

1728
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:01,783
[Jibran groans] Oh, fuck.

1729
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:04,244
- [Mustache] Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, shit.

1730
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:06,830
Go ahead. Shoot me.

1731
01:17:07,831 --> 01:17:09,458
Right here in the shoulder
would be good.

1732
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:11,585
That way I don't
have to shoot myself.

1733
01:17:11,835 --> 01:17:13,545
Drop the gun
or I'll break his neck.

1734
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:16,757
You can't break his neck.
It-It-It's too thick.

1735
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:20,010
I'll just twist until
something bad happens.

1736
01:17:20,093 --> 01:17:21,237
[stifled]
From where I'm sitting,

1737
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:22,261
he's super convincing.

1738
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:23,555
He can't hurt you.

1739
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:26,308
I bet he can do it quite easily.

1740
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,661
- [Mustache] Drop it.
- Leilani, listen to him.

1741
01:17:28,685 --> 01:17:29,686
Put the gun down.

1742
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:30,771
You don't have a shot.

1743
01:17:30,854 --> 01:17:32,206
- Just put it down.
- I do have a shot.

1744
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:34,232
Why are you arguing with me
about this?

1745
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:35,585
Because you think
you're always right,

1746
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:36,919
and you're wrong
about this, okay?

1747
01:17:36,943 --> 01:17:38,504
I'm supposed to listen
to someone who's never

1748
01:17:38,528 --> 01:17:40,238
held a gun before,
and I'm the know-it-all?

1749
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:41,674
- You refuse to take risks!
- [Mustache] Guys...

1750
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:42,616
This is a prime example.

1751
01:17:42,699 --> 01:17:43,926
- You're the reason we're here!
- Guys...

1752
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:45,327
- This is your fault!
- Guys!

1753
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:46,721
Do you really wanna do this
right now?

1754
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:48,538
Oh, my God.
I wanted to go to the police!

1755
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:49,956
You were driving the car!

1756
01:17:50,248 --> 01:17:51,708
I got kicked by a horse for you!

1757
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:52,977
- Oh, my God.
- [Leilani] You just ran from

1758
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:54,604
- a dead body and left me.
- You guys are so annoying.

1759
01:17:54,628 --> 01:17:56,088
I am alone in this relationship.

1760
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:57,756
You watched my movie
without asking me!

1761
01:17:57,964 --> 01:17:59,025
Nobody cares about your shit.

1762
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:00,193
Stop! You sound like
my parents!

1763
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:01,843
Understand what I'm doing
for once!

1764
01:18:01,968 --> 01:18:03,011
Be with me on something!

1765
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:04,096
- One, two, three!
- Go!

1766
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:05,931
[screams]

1767
01:18:06,723 --> 01:18:08,350
- [Jibran groans]
- shit.

1768
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:10,936
- Jibran, are you okay?
- Yeah.

1769
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:12,020
[Leilani] Oh, shit.

1770
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:13,730
[both gasping in relief]

1771
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:17,108
[Leilani] Oh, my God.

1772
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:18,902
- [Mustache yelling]
- [Leilani screaming]

1773
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:21,655
[Mustache groans]

1774
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,574
[both gasping]

1775
01:18:27,411 --> 01:18:29,287
[both panting]

{\an3}[siren wailing in the distance]

1777
01:18:49,349 --> 01:18:50,576
[Detective Martin]
Thanks to you guys,

1778
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:53,019
we have the suspect
in custody. You're safe now.

1779
01:18:56,022 --> 01:18:57,774
[indistinct radio chatter]

1780
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,112
Sure you're okay?

1781
01:19:02,195 --> 01:19:03,780
Yeah, I'm okay. Are you?

1782
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:05,115
Yeah.

1783
01:19:06,199 --> 01:19:07,343
You know, I knew
you were gonna do that

1784
01:19:07,367 --> 01:19:09,262
"one, two, three" thing,
even though it didn't work

1785
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:11,163
any other time. [chuckles]

1786
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:12,557
- You did everything.
- No, it was equal.

1787
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:13,582
- You did.
- It was equal!

1788
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:15,542
- You shot him!
- I know. Don't...

1789
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:17,586
- That was amazing.
- I would rather forget that.

1790
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:18,896
Don't ever shoot anyone
ever again.

1791
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,505
I will never shoot anyone
ever again.

1792
01:19:23,341 --> 01:19:25,177
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

1793
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,386
I know that face.

1794
01:19:27,137 --> 01:19:28,054
What face?

1795
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:29,598
It's the
"I wanna kiss you" face.

1796
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:31,391
- No, no. No, I don't...
- Yes, it is.

1797
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:32,809
- I don't wanna kiss you.
- Oh.

1798
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,937
I don't, so...
You're very arrogant. Gross.

1799
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:37,314
[laughs] Oh, gross?

1800
01:19:37,397 --> 01:19:39,691
Wow, you wanna kiss me so bad,

1801
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,568
like, with tongue
and everything. I can tell.

1802
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:42,778
You are projecting.

1803
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:44,529
- Oh, okay.
- I think you wanna kiss me.

1804
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,281
- I wanna kiss you?
- You wanna kiss me.

1805
01:19:46,364 --> 01:19:47,949
And you're, like,
doing this now.

1806
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:49,910
Doing what? What am I doing?

1807

[soft knocking]

1808

[paramedic]
Sorry to interrupt, lovebirds.

1809
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:04,650
I gotta take you
to the hospital,

1810
01:20:04,674 --> 01:20:06,760
have them check you out.
It's protocol.

1811
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:13,475
Back-of-the-ambulance sex
is pretty freaky, right?

1812
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:16,520
- I am so down.
- All right, let's go.

1813
01:20:17,437 --> 01:20:18,498
[Leilani] Are you gonna
try that move

1814
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:19,356
we saw in the orgy?

1815
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:21,191
[Jibran] Oh, I'm gonna
put in some work!

1816

[Leilani] Mmm-mmm,
you don't sound right.

- Run, run, run!
- Jibran, I'm running.

1823
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,604
Don't tell me to run
when I'm already running!

right there! We're so fucked!
