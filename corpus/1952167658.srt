1
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:30,743
Do you remember many years ago
Father took me aside

2
00:04:30,823 --> 00:04:34,103
and told me I was preoccupied
with the insignificant

3
00:04:34,743 --> 00:04:37,903
morbidly preoccupied,
in his opinion.

4
00:04:38,463 --> 00:04:42,423
Well, for years now, I've led a life
that even he must call normal.

5
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:48,623
Except for the fact that in my odd,
spare moments... I write.

6
00:04:49,943 --> 00:04:54,583
It may be a disappointment to him,
but I ask is it a crime?

7
00:05:01,543 --> 00:05:02,503
Kafka?

8
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:08,183
The Keeper of the Files needs
your summation of the Erlarger claim.

9
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,623
I gave it to him yesterday.

10
00:05:09,703 --> 00:05:11,943
- You didn't give it to me.
- I gave it to him.

11
00:05:14,383 --> 00:05:18,543
In an organization
as efficient as ours

12
00:05:20,143 --> 00:05:27,664
When a document, once in a great while,
gets lost it may never be found.

13
00:05:27,704 --> 00:05:29,904
It seemed easier,
as I was passing by.

14
00:05:29,984 --> 00:05:31,904
But I'm the messenger!

15
00:05:35,144 --> 00:05:38,184
An error like this
damages my credibility.

16
00:05:38,784 --> 00:05:42,824
Burgel, your credibility
is unparalleled.

17
00:05:44,864 --> 00:05:51,584
When I deliver a message, the act of delivering it,
you might say has an official stamp.

18
00:05:52,744 --> 00:05:54,224
I'll write that down.

19
00:05:56,504 --> 00:06:02,904
Your position in this firm
is not unassailable.

20
00:06:31,904 --> 00:06:33,464
Good morning, Miss Rossman.

21
00:06:34,504 --> 00:06:35,664
Or should I say, afternoon?

22
00:06:35,744 --> 00:06:38,784
- Say what you like. Nobody listens.
- Don't they?

23
00:06:39,344 --> 00:06:43,544
You underestimate my station
in this office and overrate yours.

24
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:45,064
Not now, Burgel.

25
00:06:45,144 --> 00:06:47,464
It is I who gives advice here,
not you.

26
00:06:47,544 --> 00:06:52,424
By telling the Chief Clerk
of your unpunctuality

27
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:56,184
it's not my position which is compromised,
if that's what you're implying.

28
00:06:56,264 --> 00:06:57,384
You're just doing your job.

29
00:06:58,464 --> 00:06:59,784
It's what I'm paid to do.

30
00:07:07,424 --> 00:07:08,264
Sweet?

31
00:07:09,384 --> 00:07:10,584
You're pathetic.

32
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:12,984
And you're late.

33
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:16,504
Write that down in your little book.

34
00:07:35,345 --> 00:07:37,865
I work in the section next to you.

35
00:07:37,945 --> 00:07:38,705
I know.

36
00:07:41,305 --> 00:07:43,265
I understand you're a friend of Eduard Raban.

37
00:07:44,185 --> 00:07:44,905
Am i?

38
00:07:48,505 --> 00:07:50,465
He mentioned that he knew you and

39
00:07:50,545 --> 00:07:52,265
One of you must be mistaken.

40
00:07:56,985 --> 00:08:00,425
I'm sorry, but I'm sure
that I saw you together

41
00:08:00,465 --> 00:08:01,665
There are people watching!

42
00:08:03,105 --> 00:08:04,825
Don't make me embarrass you.

43
00:08:07,105 --> 00:08:08,505
You have ink on your nose.

44
00:08:18,385 --> 00:08:20,105
I'll expect your written resignation

45
00:08:23,385 --> 00:08:24,345
immediately.

46
00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:32,505
Ah! Away from your section without cause.

47
00:08:35,065 --> 00:08:36,705
I knew it would happen one day.

48
00:08:42,585 --> 00:08:43,465
Kafka?

49
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:44,665
Yes, sir.

50
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:26,025
Then it's Kafka.

51
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:27,505
Oh, yes.

52
00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:02,626
I'm looking for Mr. Raban, from upstairs.

53
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:03,866
I can't hear you.

54
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:07,746
Mr. Raban
Do you know where he is?

55
00:10:09,346 --> 00:10:12,986
You didn't need to come out of bed.
I could have taken the key.

56
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:14,626
Yes, I'm sure you could.

57
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:45,226
Should you be looking at that?

58
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,546
It's my house, isn't it?

59
00:10:48,866 --> 00:10:51,026
- Well, yes, but
- Out

60
00:10:51,106 --> 00:10:53,266
He's not here, so out! Come on.

61
00:11:06,986 --> 00:11:08,466
Have you seen Eduard Raban?

62
00:11:09,186 --> 00:11:09,946
No.

63
00:11:14,786 --> 00:11:16,386
Has anyone here seen Eduard?

64
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:21,386
Have you seen Eduard tonight?
Eduard Raban?

65
00:11:22,386 --> 00:11:24,306
Last week he told
those jokes you loved

66
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:26,786
Oh? Doesn't sound like me.

67
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:28,386
Didn't he run away with those actors?

68
00:11:28,466 --> 00:11:32,747
- You coming to the cabaret?
- No, I have to work.

69
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:34,547
Don't you ever sleep?

70
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:36,507
Yes, that was him.

71
00:11:38,147 --> 00:11:40,947
- Leaving?
- I'm looking for Eduard. You seen him?

72
00:11:41,027 --> 00:11:42,107
- Who?
- Eduard

73
00:11:42,187 --> 00:11:46,467
Wait here. We're just picking up Julius.
You know Anna, don't you?

74
00:11:53,227 --> 00:11:54,427
How long have you been here?

75
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:55,467
I just got here.

76
00:11:57,027 --> 00:11:58,627
No, how long have you been here?

77
00:11:58,707 --> 00:12:00,667
A few days.
I went to your parents' house.

78
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,267
- You saw Father?
- I didn't go to see him.

79
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,027
But I wrote you I'd moved out.

80
00:12:06,107 --> 00:12:09,507
You wrote you wanted to moved out.
Repeatedly and at great length.

81
00:12:16,467 --> 00:12:20,427
I'm living in town now because of my work.
You can save on postage.

82
00:12:22,787 --> 00:12:24,347
Anyway, you know where to find me.

83
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:29,427
He's coming over.

84
00:12:31,587 --> 00:12:33,107
I went to Eduard's apartment.

85
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,827
- Eduard's apartment.
- He's not there.

86
00:12:35,907 --> 00:12:40,427
He hasn't been seen there.
I mean, not for a day or two.

87
00:12:50,347 --> 00:12:52,147
Not by the landlady, in any case.

88
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:55,747
Thank you.

89
00:12:57,507 --> 00:12:58,267
I'll try again then.

90
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:05,707
- How much have you told him?
- He knows only a clerk nothing.

91
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:09,187
- Eduard said he's a writer.
- That may be useful.

92
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:10,987
That may be dangerous.

93
00:13:14,747 --> 00:13:17,387
It's not your bike, Frederic!

94
00:13:18,107 --> 00:13:20,547
Kafka! Will we see you at the cabaret?

95
00:13:20,627 --> 00:13:21,867
You won't get in now.

96
00:13:21,947 --> 00:13:24,507
Another excuse to go, Homer

97
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:26,867
What are you working on?

98
00:13:26,947 --> 00:13:28,547
I think about a man

99
00:13:28,627 --> 00:13:30,748
who wakes up himself transformed

100
00:13:36,028 --> 00:13:36,988
Oh! Drinking

101
00:13:48,388 --> 00:13:51,228
The most thing is castle with majestic

102
00:13:51,668 --> 00:13:53,428
Only, as distance

103
00:13:55,548 --> 00:13:56,508
Oh! Have we met?

104
00:13:56,588 --> 00:13:58,788
Bizzlebek is the name

105
00:13:59,668 --> 00:14:01,948
- The gravedigger.
- Stonecutter, really.

106
00:14:02,028 --> 00:14:02,828
Sorry.

107
00:14:03,548 --> 00:14:06,948
Sculptor, if I had any freedom in the matter.

108
00:14:07,028 --> 00:14:09,588
But one should be called artist
only if he's paid for it.

109
00:14:09,668 --> 00:14:11,788
and perhaps not even then.

110
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:15,508
Yours is a noisy line of work.

111
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,468
Well, it's external noise.

112
00:14:19,628 --> 00:14:21,348
Whereas you

113
00:14:22,148 --> 00:14:25,148
the reverberations are inside.

114
00:14:25,748 --> 00:14:28,268
I've read your stories. They're quite fantastic.

115
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,708
I can't imagine what you read.

116
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:32,788
Just what you've published.

117
00:14:33,428 --> 00:14:35,148
In magazines nobody reads.

118
00:14:36,468 --> 00:14:39,308
They should be filed in the Castle
with all other useless paper.

119
00:14:40,428 --> 00:14:43,108
Nonetheless, some of us are
interested in your case.

120
00:14:44,388 --> 00:14:48,428
That one story, for instance,
about the penal colony.

121
00:14:50,508 --> 00:14:55,068
The needles inscribing the judgment
into the flesh of the condemned man.

122
00:14:56,908 --> 00:14:57,948
It's new.

123
00:14:58,748 --> 00:15:02,788
I need to find a clever device
to make my work more noticeable.

124
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:08,148
I'm off to the cabaret.
After a day at the Castle cemetery.

125
00:15:08,228 --> 00:15:12,028
I have a strong urge to see figures
in motion before going to bed.

126
00:15:14,228 --> 00:15:15,428
Good night, Kafka.

127
00:15:16,188 --> 00:15:17,348
Good night, Mr. Bizzlebek.

128
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:41,829
The terrible toil of the insurance
office continues as ever.

129
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:46,189
I am continually harassed
by petty tyrants.

130
00:15:46,869 --> 00:15:50,189
as I issue pointless reports.

131
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:53,069
My friend Eduard has disappeared.

132
00:15:54,869 --> 00:15:57,389
You never met him because
I never dared bring a friend home.

133
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:01,749
Not with Father lording over
us all from his armchair.

134
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:04,549
Now I gather Anna
has paid you a visit.

135
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:09,949
My relations with her have
been difficult, to say the least.

136
00:16:10,789 --> 00:16:14,149
I can only hope Father didn't
frighten her away any further.

137
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:19,549
Your son...
Your loving son

138
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,869
Your occasionally loving son

139
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:27,669
Your incapable-of-loving son

140
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:32,229
Your absolutely-bored-to-death-
with-any-sort-of-family-life son.

141
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,230
You know him?

142
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,870
Yes.

143
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,310
His name is Eduard Raban?

144
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,190
Yes.

145
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,630
Inspector Grubach.

146
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,030
Kafka.

147
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,710
Kafka, Kafka...
Is that your real name?

148
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,710
Yes.

149
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,670
Why Shouldn't it be?

150
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:00,270
When was the last time
you saw Mr. Raban?

151
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:01,830
Wednesday.

152
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,550
- At work?
- Yes.

153
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:07,150
Did you go anywhere afterward?
To have a drink, perhaps?

154
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,870
No, We said

155
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,030
good-bye outside the office,

156
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,910
and he went to his house.

157
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,110
- You work for workers.
- Accident Insurance.

158
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:22,310
- Where you've been employed seven years.
- Eight.

159
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,790
And seven months.

160
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,670
Would you describe your
relationship with Raban?

161
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,430
as close?

162
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,790
No.

163
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,990
No?

164
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,550
Yes.

165
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,270
Yes, no, yes, no
what?

166
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:49,310
I worked in the same office
with him for three years.

167
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,590
He was found in the river.
Could he swim?

168
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,070
Do you think?

169
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,310
You think he drowned himself?

170
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:07,430
Grown men don't normally
fall into the river, do they?

171
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:08,870
No.

172
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,630
He may have had a few drinks,
despite what you think.

173
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,630
Can I ask how you found me?

174
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:23,310
Of course. His landlady
told us you'd been there

175
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:28,510
and that you took a great interest
in looking through his things.

176
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,511
Well, uh, he was a very close f...

177
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:38,391
He didn't have any other fr...
He had no family.

178
00:19:39,671 --> 00:19:40,631
We know that.

179
00:19:46,071 --> 00:19:47,031
Is that all?

180
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,991
No. We know other
things, too. Kafka.

181
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:43,071
I don't usually get involved
with people in the Old Quarter

182
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:44,591
but the river runs its own course.

183
00:20:45,471 --> 00:20:48,831
I'd like you to know that in me
you have, not a friend, of course

184
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:53,591
because we are strangers
from incompatible social classes

185
00:20:54,431 --> 00:21:03,271
but to some extent, shall we
say an interested third party.

186
00:21:03,751 --> 00:21:05,751
I'll bear that in mind.

187
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:11,231
Yes, Should you happen upon
anything that might be relevant.

188
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:15,031
Yes.

189
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:21,191
Inspector GRUBACH

190
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:55,392
You asked to see me?

191
00:21:55,432 --> 00:21:57,232
Sit down, Kafka.

192
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,032
You've been here for nearly 9 years.

193
00:22:19,112 --> 00:22:22,992
You've done your work diligently.
There are no complaints on that score.

194
00:22:26,472 --> 00:22:28,912
But there's more to
the job than the work.

195
00:22:29,672 --> 00:22:32,032
There are other people to consider.

196
00:22:32,672 --> 00:22:34,992
And frankly, Kafka...

197
00:22:35,672 --> 00:22:39,112
We feel your social activities
leave a lot to be desired.

198
00:22:39,832 --> 00:22:42,392
My social activities?

199
00:22:42,472 --> 00:22:43,872
You're a lone wolf.

200
00:22:43,952 --> 00:22:48,312
You keep too much to yourself.
It makes me uneasy.

201
00:22:49,272 --> 00:22:52,752
and if it makes me uneasy, I can't
imagine the impression you make

202
00:22:53,712 --> 00:22:55,752
on lesser employees.

203
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:56,992
But in order to

204
00:22:57,032 --> 00:23:01,472
finish my work, I have little time

205
00:23:01,552 --> 00:23:03,032
You must make the time.

206
00:23:06,432 --> 00:23:08,192
Have you never wondered

207
00:23:08,272 --> 00:23:12,272
Why other clerks have advanced
to higher positions, while you

208
00:23:12,352 --> 00:23:14,672
who've been here longer, have not?

209
00:23:15,512 --> 00:23:16,232
No, sir.

210
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:19,112
It doesn't matter how well you do your work.

211
00:23:19,792 --> 00:23:22,432
You clearly view it as something to get through

212
00:23:22,512 --> 00:23:25,192
not something to take
an active interest in.

213
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:30,232
I know you were friendly with that poor fellow.
What was his name?

214
00:23:31,032 --> 00:23:32,272
Eduard Raban?

215
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,073
Yes, Raban.

216
00:23:34,153 --> 00:23:37,393
But he was too like you.
Even more like you perhaps

217
00:23:37,473 --> 00:23:40,193
than you are yourself.

218
00:23:40,273 --> 00:23:42,673
In any case, don't ask me why

219
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:47,513
word has come down you are to
receive the promotion intended for him.

220
00:23:49,233 --> 00:23:54,633
You will be given two assistants
and a commensurate rise in salary.

221
00:23:57,193 --> 00:23:58,113
That's all.

222
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:10,073
Thank you.

223
00:24:12,273 --> 00:24:17,913
I understand you fancy
yourself as a writer.

224
00:24:19,953 --> 00:24:21,113
In a small way.

225
00:24:22,153 --> 00:24:26,553
You should find a more athletic hobby.

226
00:24:27,553 --> 00:24:29,953
Put some color in your cheeks.

227
00:25:16,153 --> 00:25:17,433
My assistants, I presume.

228
00:25:20,713 --> 00:25:21,553
I'm Kafka.

229
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:22,473
Ludwig.

230
00:25:23,073 --> 00:25:23,793
Oscar.

231
00:25:33,553 --> 00:25:34,233
You're brothers?

232
00:25:34,313 --> 00:25:36,114
- Twins.
- Actually.

233
00:25:38,794 --> 00:25:40,434
- Have you worked here long?
- Why?

234
00:25:40,514 --> 00:25:41,634
- No.
- Yes.

235
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:43,714
- Actually.
- Long.

236
00:25:56,674 --> 00:25:58,114
Well, let's start moving in.

237
00:26:45,594 --> 00:26:46,754
Are you free for lunch?

238
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:51,114
Eduard. That's

239
00:26:52,434 --> 00:26:53,834
That's a very difficult subject.

240
00:26:54,514 --> 00:26:56,314
He wasn't capable of suicide.

241
00:26:56,394 --> 00:26:58,514
He was obsessed
by the idea of it.

242
00:27:02,314 --> 00:27:04,434
I was surprised by the

243
00:27:08,114 --> 00:27:11,714
Surprised by the timing,
but I wasn't surprised by the act.

244
00:27:13,234 --> 00:27:16,994
Perhaps he had two faces.
One for you and one for me.

245
00:27:17,074 --> 00:27:18,994
- He wasn't like that.
- Are you sure?

246
00:27:19,074 --> 00:27:20,354
I knew him very well.

247
00:27:21,554 --> 00:27:24,794
Then you knew we
were having an affair.

248
00:27:26,514 --> 00:27:27,274
Oh, yes.

249
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:32,394
Eduard and I led very different
lives outside the office.

250
00:27:32,474 --> 00:27:34,394
We knew there might be consequences.

251
00:27:35,635 --> 00:27:36,595
What sort of consequences?

252
00:27:38,475 --> 00:27:39,755
Look what happened.

253
00:27:40,515 --> 00:27:41,995
We don't know he wasn't robbed.

254
00:27:42,075 --> 00:27:44,955
The police identified
him by his wallet.

255
00:27:45,035 --> 00:27:46,955
And you believe everything so is tell you?

256
00:27:46,995 --> 00:27:48,235
When I have no reason to doubt.

257
00:27:49,155 --> 00:27:53,155
They're authorities. That's reason enough.
The police may have killed him.

258
00:27:59,995 --> 00:28:00,835
Why would they do that?

259
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:04,635
Will you meet me tonight?

260
00:28:08,515 --> 00:28:09,235
Tonight?

261
00:28:14,395 --> 00:28:15,195
Where?

262
00:28:15,275 --> 00:28:16,715
The Musil District.

263
00:28:18,515 --> 00:28:19,355
Right.

264
00:28:21,835 --> 00:28:22,915
Does that mean yes?

265
00:28:24,435 --> 00:28:26,635
Oh, yes. Tonight.

266
00:28:32,635 --> 00:28:34,395
Weren't you almost
married recently?

267
00:28:35,635 --> 00:28:36,795
Oh, yes. Uh...

268
00:28:38,915 --> 00:28:43,155
Last year I was engaged, twice...
to the same woman.

269
00:28:44,075 --> 00:28:47,395
I'm not really...

270
00:28:48,555 --> 00:28:49,955
I broke it off.

271
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,755
Eduard wanted to get married.

272
00:28:55,515 --> 00:28:56,315
And you?

273
00:28:59,515 --> 00:29:01,475
I'm suspicious of men
who want to marry.

274
00:29:12,555 --> 00:29:15,955
What time? Whereabouts
in the Musil District?

275
00:29:17,515 --> 00:29:21,835
Go to the Esplanade. Nine o'clock.
you'll find your way from there.

276
00:30:06,196 --> 00:30:07,156
Enjoy.

277
00:30:26,596 --> 00:30:28,076
It's another bombing!

278
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,277
I think it's dangerous...

279
00:31:45,997 --> 00:31:49,077
He might be able to help...

280
00:31:49,797 --> 00:31:53,677
It's too risky...

281
00:31:59,277 --> 00:32:00,397
Please sit down, Kafka.

282
00:32:16,597 --> 00:32:21,637
I doubt Eduard told you
about us and our... Activities.

283
00:32:23,397 --> 00:32:24,917
Why bring me into it?

284
00:32:24,997 --> 00:32:26,477
My question exactly.

285
00:32:27,037 --> 00:32:29,077
Have you seen any of
our literature?

286
00:32:34,837 --> 00:32:36,077
I can't say I have.

287
00:32:36,157 --> 00:32:39,237
Our present distribution
is not effective.

288
00:32:39,317 --> 00:32:41,957
The issue at hand is quality.

289
00:32:42,037 --> 00:32:44,077
We thought you might
be able to help us.

290
00:32:47,397 --> 00:32:49,357
I wright by myself...

291
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:52,717
for myself.

292
00:32:54,677 --> 00:32:55,477
You see?

293
00:32:57,557 --> 00:32:59,757
This work can change
the way things are.

294
00:33:00,357 --> 00:33:01,797
It's not work I can do...

295
00:33:02,917 --> 00:33:06,157
even if I were sympathetic
to your... cause.

296
00:33:07,037 --> 00:33:09,037
It's not work I can do for hire.

297
00:33:09,597 --> 00:33:11,637
They may start proceedings
against you.

298
00:33:13,837 --> 00:33:14,837
What kind of proceedings?

299
00:33:15,477 --> 00:33:18,957
- An investigation which is the trial.
- And the sentencing.

300
00:33:19,037 --> 00:33:21,197
Eduard found out what those are like.

301
00:33:21,277 --> 00:33:25,117
The day he died, Eduard was
called to the castle. Did you hnow that?

302
00:33:28,717 --> 00:33:29,557
What of it?

303
00:33:29,597 --> 00:33:32,957
He was summonded to correct...

304
00:33:33,037 --> 00:33:34,477
a discrepancy in Medical Records.

305
00:33:34,557 --> 00:33:36,597
And he was never seen alive again.

306
00:33:37,438 --> 00:33:40,278
What does that prove?
That he was murdered?

307
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:41,398
He was murdered!

308
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:45,798
A pass into the Castle was
an opportunity we couldn't ignore.

309
00:33:45,878 --> 00:33:50,238
He set off that evening, carrying
one of our custom-made "briefcases"

310
00:33:52,358 --> 00:33:54,958
With a message... for the Castle.

311
00:34:03,518 --> 00:34:05,758
The Thought of Eduard
delivering a bomb shocks you?

312
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:08,838
you needn't accept
everything as true.

313
00:34:09,638 --> 00:34:11,438
You need only accept
it as necessary.

314
00:34:11,998 --> 00:34:15,958
The bomb didn't go off, so he must
have been caught and executed.

315
00:34:16,038 --> 00:34:17,878
It has happened before.

316
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,518
Must have been?
Did any of you...

317
00:34:20,638 --> 00:34:23,398
Those file clerks at the
Castle will deny everything.

318
00:34:24,198 --> 00:34:27,358
No doubt he was handed
over to the police, discreetly.

319
00:34:27,438 --> 00:34:30,078
We've had no repercussions
as yet.

320
00:34:30,158 --> 00:34:33,358
Eduard must not have talked
You're the one they contacted.

321
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:39,918
So that's who the enemy is
policemen and file clerks.

322
00:34:40,558 --> 00:34:41,998
Law and order, you might say.

323
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,998
You think what we're
doing is wrong?

324
00:34:46,478 --> 00:34:48,198
What would you suggest then?

325
00:34:48,278 --> 00:34:50,438
Did any of you actually go up to
the Castle with Eduard? Did you?

326
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:57,198
You sit around twisting
the facts to suit your...

327
00:34:57,798 --> 00:34:59,518
inbred theories.

328
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:05,198
In my experience,
the truth is not that convenient.

329
00:35:07,518 --> 00:35:09,558
See? He thinks only of himself.

330
00:35:09,598 --> 00:35:11,238
It's why he came here tonight.

331
00:35:11,798 --> 00:35:12,758
That's true.

332
00:35:14,678 --> 00:35:15,838
It's also why I’m leaving.

333
00:36:17,279 --> 00:36:18,759
I can't swim!

334
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:55,439
Hi!

335
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:01,439
How was your evening?

336
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:02,879
- Fine.
- Terrible.

337
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:07,479
What happened?

338
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:11,919
- Whenever we go to a nightclub...
- I want to go to another one.

339
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:15,879
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

340
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:30,719
You look very tired.

341
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:33,799
Miss Rossman came to see you.

342
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:34,959
Gabriela.

343
00:37:36,479 --> 00:37:37,279
Do you know her?

344
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,120
Do you?

345
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,080
We saw her naked once.

346
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,680
All you think about is women!

347
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,600
She went to the roof
to sunbathe once

348
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,400
And we watched her change.

349
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,160
- We worked in Supplies carrying boxes
- Boxes of medicine

350
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,000
- We dropped them a lot.
- He dropped them.

351
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,840
It's not too bad working here, though.

352
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:02,480
You've never felt it was a horrible
double life from which there was
probably no escape but insanity?

353
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,240
- Yes
- No

354
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,400
I envy you

355
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,840
- You should be content, y'know
- You should!

356
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,040
You are looking for Gabriela Rossman?

357
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,000
Yes

358
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,040
Please

359
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,160
Who's been open

360
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,200
Shall I reseal it?

361
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,160
There's not a lot of point.

362
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,120
I got your note
Burgel gave it to me.

363
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,040
I didn't leave it with Burgel.

364
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,200
What are you doing?

365
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,320
Getting Eduard's things,
so no one else does.

366
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,001
Things of value or things
which connect you two?

367
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:43,041
Both.

368
00:39:43,121 --> 00:39:46,481
I thought you might like
to do the same. Yours?

369
00:39:51,161 --> 00:39:54,281
Probably not worth keeping.

370
00:39:56,841 --> 00:39:58,281
Some of those letters may be mine.

371
00:40:07,881 --> 00:40:08,601
Dame it!

372
00:40:09,601 --> 00:40:10,161
Are you all right?

373
00:40:16,521 --> 00:40:17,601
Why were you fired?

374
00:40:18,201 --> 00:40:22,281
They don't need reasons.
To fire me, to kill Eduard.

375
00:40:22,361 --> 00:40:23,841
They? Who is "they"?

376
00:40:23,881 --> 00:40:27,321
They! the authorities, the police!
The Castle, Burgel!

377
00:40:27,401 --> 00:40:31,601
Burgel? I don't see Burgel as a "they"

378
00:40:32,401 --> 00:40:33,401
He's more of an "it"

379
00:40:34,241 --> 00:40:38,921
It's the small ones you have to look
out for. The small men with small ideas.

380
00:40:40,001 --> 00:40:40,801
Don't open that.

381
00:40:41,721 --> 00:40:42,321
Why not?

382
00:40:44,081 --> 00:40:44,761
Why not?

383
00:40:44,841 --> 00:40:47,241
Opening and closing the
latch activates it.

384
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:58,641
You said Eduard was murdered
while he was carrying the bomb.

385
00:41:00,161 --> 00:41:01,321
If this the bomb...

386
00:41:03,321 --> 00:41:04,641
How many bombs are there?

387
00:41:04,721 --> 00:41:07,041
- You still think it was suicide.
- What?

388
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:10,841
Less trouble for the police.
Less disturbing for you.

389
00:41:10,921 --> 00:41:13,121
- I just want to know.
- Then open it!

390
00:41:16,681 --> 00:41:18,401
Don't think they're not watching.

391
00:41:19,481 --> 00:41:22,441
To them, we're all connected.
The group, Eduard, me, you.

392
00:41:24,001 --> 00:41:24,601
Gabriela.

393
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:27,641
if I waited for you to understand,
it'd be too late.

394
00:42:30,482 --> 00:42:32,242
I looked in the street
She wasn't there.

395
00:42:32,282 --> 00:42:37,082
She disappeared between leaving
the room and coming outside.

396
00:42:37,162 --> 00:42:39,282
- Did you go to her house?
- Did I what?

397
00:42:40,202 --> 00:42:42,802
Did you go to her house?

398
00:42:43,522 --> 00:42:44,842
No, I didn't go to her house.

399
00:42:46,642 --> 00:42:47,762
I see.

400
00:42:56,922 --> 00:42:59,282
Why would someone want to
kidnap this woman?

401
00:42:59,362 --> 00:43:02,242
Her name is, uh... Roseman?

402
00:43:02,322 --> 00:43:04,002
Rossman.

403
00:43:09,122 --> 00:43:09,962
Why?

404
00:43:11,402 --> 00:43:14,162
You asked me to tell you
if anything relevant came up.

405
00:43:15,162 --> 00:43:17,562
Miss Rossman is relevant.

406
00:43:19,162 --> 00:43:23,722
When we talked before, I didn't
know she was... friendly with Mr. Raban.

407
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:26,482
She was friendly with many people.

408
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,282
She was friendly with you.

409
00:43:28,362 --> 00:43:32,202
That has been noted.
But where does it lead us?

410
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:37,002
Unless you have
something more to add.

411
00:43:40,282 --> 00:43:41,203
She's missing!

412
00:43:42,483 --> 00:43:43,763
Isn't that enough for you?

413
00:43:43,843 --> 00:43:45,563
Yes, that's enough.

414
00:43:46,363 --> 00:43:47,363
She lost her job today.

415
00:43:48,123 --> 00:43:52,163
I'd probably go away and
brood a bit myself. Is that yours?

416
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:55,643
Yes.

417
00:44:08,003 --> 00:44:09,563
maybe she was right
in what she said.

418
00:44:10,763 --> 00:44:11,643
What did she say?

419
00:44:14,923 --> 00:44:16,283
That perhaps the police

420
00:44:17,043 --> 00:44:20,483
have allegiance to
something other than the truth.

421
00:44:23,323 --> 00:44:26,123
She never believed
Eduard's death was suicide.

422
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,483
And for the record,
neither do i.

423
00:44:41,883 --> 00:44:42,843
It doesn't rhyme.

424
00:44:42,883 --> 00:44:46,643
You can't use it in that context.
You must move through it.

425
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,043
Come sit with us.

426
00:44:49,123 --> 00:44:50,883
No, I'm looking for some people.

427
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:54,443
Insect people.

428
00:45:00,963 --> 00:45:02,723
You may be onto something.

429
00:45:04,043 --> 00:45:04,683
What?

430
00:45:06,123 --> 00:45:09,603
Meeting women.
You've discovered a way in and out.

431
00:45:09,683 --> 00:45:13,443
You enter dramatically, spilling
over with concern for a lost friend.

432
00:45:14,443 --> 00:45:16,003
That appeals to their
caring nature.

433
00:45:16,043 --> 00:45:18,243
If things go poorly,
you leave, citing the need

434
00:45:18,323 --> 00:45:22,923
to look elsewhere as
your motive. It's perfect.

435
00:45:24,483 --> 00:45:26,163
Yes, it would be perfect...

436
00:45:27,203 --> 00:45:29,123
if that were my intent.

437
00:45:34,563 --> 00:45:35,963
What other intent is there?

438
00:45:44,964 --> 00:45:46,884
- Gabriela disapperared.
- We know.

439
00:45:46,964 --> 00:45:48,444
Why did you call the police?

440
00:45:48,524 --> 00:45:52,364
- What did you tell them?
- That I was concerned for her safety.

441
00:45:52,444 --> 00:45:53,724
Be concerned for us.

442
00:45:53,804 --> 00:45:57,524
- What about her?
- Any of us might be next.

443
00:45:57,604 --> 00:45:59,764
- You might be next.
- Not me.

444
00:45:59,844 --> 00:46:02,044
- We intend to stay together.
- Very close.

445
00:46:02,124 --> 00:46:04,324
- They find you alone and strike
- Stay with us

446
00:46:04,404 --> 00:46:06,164
- Listen. We found the bomb.
- What?

447
00:46:06,244 --> 00:46:08,764
In Eduard's apartment.
Unopened.

448
00:46:08,844 --> 00:46:10,684
Obviously unopened!

449
00:46:10,764 --> 00:46:14,284
If it were opened,
it wouldn't last very long, right?

450
00:46:14,364 --> 00:46:17,204
- You gave it to the police.
- No, it's in my apartment.

451
00:46:17,284 --> 00:46:19,244
Where it does no one any good.

452
00:46:19,284 --> 00:46:21,204
Or any harm.

453
00:46:21,244 --> 00:46:22,484
Eduard, Gabriela, Kafka.

454
00:46:22,564 --> 00:46:23,644
All from the same office.

455
00:46:24,764 --> 00:46:26,124
It might be a cover-up.

456
00:46:26,204 --> 00:46:27,684
Of incredible proportions.

457
00:46:27,764 --> 00:46:29,644
It could be embezzlement.

458
00:46:29,684 --> 00:46:31,164
It's always about money.

459
00:46:31,244 --> 00:46:34,884
Clearly, there's no shortage of theories.
What's needed are facts.

460
00:46:36,964 --> 00:46:41,724
We need to know more about
why Eduard was summoned to the Castle.

461
00:46:43,164 --> 00:46:43,844
Excuse me.

462
00:46:46,644 --> 00:46:49,004
I understand you have
Eduard Raban's file.

463
00:46:49,044 --> 00:46:49,844
I do.

464
00:46:49,924 --> 00:46:53,564
Might I look at it for an
address for his family?

465
00:46:55,364 --> 00:46:56,324
I'd like to write to them.

466
00:47:04,484 --> 00:47:08,204
No entry for family.

467
00:47:11,204 --> 00:47:12,284
Was there something else?

468
00:47:13,804 --> 00:47:18,324
No. It's just that I feel
a sense of obligation.

469
00:47:19,204 --> 00:47:21,004
He was a very dear friend
If there's

470
00:47:21,084 --> 00:47:26,644
some way that I could help
in closing up his affairs.

471
00:47:27,884 --> 00:47:30,884
There's but one report to complete.
I will do that myself

472
00:47:30,964 --> 00:47:34,004
and submit it to the Castle tomorrow.

473
00:47:34,524 --> 00:47:36,604
I see.

474
00:47:37,844 --> 00:47:39,484
There's just the Erlanger claim.

475
00:47:39,564 --> 00:47:41,284
The Orlac chaim.

476
00:47:42,885 --> 00:47:46,085
Well, thank you, sir.

477
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:50,725
You're too sensitive.

478
00:47:51,485 --> 00:47:52,405
Yes, sir.

479
00:47:53,965 --> 00:47:56,725
Let the poor fellow rest in peace.

480
00:48:05,885 --> 00:48:08,925
If you wanted accounts,
why did you ask for employees?

481
00:48:09,005 --> 00:48:10,165
Orlac is an account?

482
00:48:10,245 --> 00:48:13,445
It's a factory in the northern mountains.
An excellent customer.

483
00:48:14,485 --> 00:48:18,045
Without a proper request,
I am not obliged to do this.

484
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:23,445
But I will make an exception
on this one occasion.

485
00:48:25,605 --> 00:48:29,285
At least the file is current,
even if the employee isn't.

486
00:48:36,245 --> 00:48:37,885
That place has so many accidents

487
00:48:37,885 --> 00:48:42,565
it's a good thing the peasants there
have no trouble with procreating.

488
00:48:46,325 --> 00:48:47,525
All these in the last year?

489
00:48:47,605 --> 00:48:49,845
Terrible accidents up there.

490
00:48:49,925 --> 00:48:54,965
Cave-ins primarily. They can't even
recover the bodies. Awful way to die.

491
00:48:55,045 --> 00:48:56,085
yes.

492
00:48:56,165 --> 00:48:59,925
That's bad enough,
but even the district medical Officer was killed.

493
00:49:00,565 --> 00:49:03,365
His picture is missing
I must make a note of that.

494
00:49:03,405 --> 00:49:06,125
- Was that Dr. Murnau?
- Yes.

495
00:49:07,925 --> 00:49:10,685
Dr. Murnau was a brave man
A true visionary.

496
00:49:10,765 --> 00:49:15,245
He spent his life in those backwaters,
unconcerned for personal gain.

497
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,485
A great loss.

498
00:49:17,525 --> 00:49:20,765
And this list is the clerks
who worked on Orlac claims?

499
00:49:20,845 --> 00:49:23,125
Yes. Is your friend's name there?

500
00:49:25,405 --> 00:49:26,165
No.

501
00:49:26,245 --> 00:49:28,485
Then he only worked on one case.

502
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:32,805
His name will appear when your Chief
sends me the final summation.

503
00:49:42,925 --> 00:49:45,766
When a file has been
sent to the Castle

504
00:49:45,846 --> 00:49:48,246
can it be recalled for review?

505
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:51,326
Of course not!
only by a Director of the firm.

506
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,846
Who would want to let in
riff-raff from the streets?

507
00:49:57,126 --> 00:50:00,086
But why keep records
if they can't be inspected?

508
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:03,766
We've had these laws for centuries.
How can you doubt them?

509
00:50:04,486 --> 00:50:06,366
Maybe I should apply
to our Directors.

510
00:50:07,286 --> 00:50:10,006
You do not summon them,
They summon you.

511
00:50:10,086 --> 00:50:13,206
And this hardly ever
happens, if at all.

512
00:50:13,286 --> 00:50:16,686
Where do the files go,
when they go to the Castle?

513
00:50:16,766 --> 00:50:20,446
We're a medical insurance firm.
They go to the Medical Records Division.

514
00:50:21,326 --> 00:50:23,726
Perhaps I should see
the head of Medical Records.

515
00:50:23,806 --> 00:50:27,286
It so happens,
my dear simple sir...

516
00:50:27,366 --> 00:50:32,366
The head of Medical Records at the Castle
is one of the Directors of this firm.

517
00:51:00,486 --> 00:51:01,686
Please!

518
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,646
- I'm trying to finish my work.
- You've actually started some?

519
00:51:05,406 --> 00:51:08,486
He's done nothing all day.
He's afraid I'll show him up.

520
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:09,686
Assistants!

521
00:51:10,766 --> 00:51:13,606
I may as well have two people
who fell from the sky.

522
00:51:13,686 --> 00:51:15,966
It's not our fault.
We're nervous.

523
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:19,286
And upset.

524
00:51:19,966 --> 00:51:20,966
What is it now?

525
00:51:21,046 --> 00:51:23,566
- Everything I say, he disagrees with.
- Everything.

526
00:51:23,646 --> 00:51:25,766
We've been together so long

527
00:51:25,846 --> 00:51:28,126
our personalities
overflow into one another.

528
00:51:28,206 --> 00:51:29,686
- And vice-versa.
- It's horrible.

529
00:51:29,726 --> 00:51:30,886
Imagine that happening to you.

530
00:51:30,966 --> 00:51:32,046
Horrible.

531
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:38,286
Why don't you both take your lunch?

532
00:51:40,006 --> 00:51:40,726
Go on!

533
00:54:08,928 --> 00:54:11,288
The Chief Clerk wants this tomorrow.

534
00:54:11,368 --> 00:54:15,008
He said it should only take you
an extra hour... or two.

535
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:31,770
Come on!
There's no one up there.

536
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:33,730
We're going now.

537
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:40,090
That's it. It's all right.

538
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:42,970
You've done very well.

539
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:00,250
Never mind them.
They'll be attended to.

540
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:08,410
Watch your step.

541
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:11,210
Excellent job.

542
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:14,330
This won't go unrecognized.

543
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:16,650
And I'm sure you'll be well rewarded.

544
00:59:53,091 --> 00:59:54,371
Almost there.

545
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:59,611
One final task.
You'll like this gentleman.

546
01:03:13,532 --> 01:03:15,492
Returning to your safe little burrow?

547
01:03:15,532 --> 01:03:17,372
No matter how deep you dig

548
01:03:17,452 --> 01:03:19,212
- you leave a trail
- we can follow.

549
01:03:19,292 --> 01:03:21,332
We're taking you to the Castle.

550
01:03:24,172 --> 01:03:24,852
So it was you.

551
01:03:26,852 --> 01:03:27,772
We thought it was Burgel.

552
01:03:27,812 --> 01:03:30,612
He wouldn't be let near the Castle.

553
01:03:30,692 --> 01:03:32,292
You should view this as a great favor.

554
01:03:33,412 --> 01:03:36,612
- We answer to the highest authority.
- Very high.

555
01:03:36,692 --> 01:03:38,852
We deal with the person in charge.

556
01:03:39,812 --> 01:03:40,532
Who is that?

557
01:03:40,612 --> 01:03:42,252
- We don't know.
- We're not allowed to say.

558
01:03:48,213 --> 01:03:50,493
Shall we?

559
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:06,493
For all your incompetence, I thought
you were loyal to me. You're good actors.

560
01:04:06,573 --> 01:04:07,613
- Yes!
- Thank you!

561
01:04:07,693 --> 01:04:10,053
- When we get to the Castle
don't make a fuss.

562
01:04:10,133 --> 01:04:12,653
It would spoil the favorable impression

563
01:04:12,733 --> 01:04:14,453
You dirty pig!

564
01:04:15,013 --> 01:04:17,053
You've created otherwise.

565
01:04:17,133 --> 01:04:20,133
Why did you bother
pursuing this at all?

566
01:04:20,213 --> 01:04:21,333
I thought it was pursuing me.

567
01:04:21,413 --> 01:04:23,693
It's always about you,
isn't it, Kafka?

568
01:04:31,173 --> 01:04:35,773
Every time I see
those two escorting someone

569
01:04:35,813 --> 01:04:37,693
the next time I see
that person is in my cemetary.

570
01:04:38,693 --> 01:04:40,573
Isn't that a coincidence?

571
01:04:42,053 --> 01:04:46,173
I'd like to go to the Castle, but
I think it's best to go alone.

572
01:04:47,493 --> 01:04:50,453
There are less conspicuous ways
to enter the Castle.

573
01:04:58,813 --> 01:05:01,773
Wouldn't you rather go
through official channels?

574
01:05:01,853 --> 01:05:05,253
They get me nowhere
They go around in circles.

575
01:05:06,093 --> 01:05:11,013
I'm flattered, of course,
to be taken into your confidence

576
01:05:11,053 --> 01:05:17,293
even without knowing all the details.
Even though I'm sure they're very interesting.

577
01:05:19,813 --> 01:05:24,053
To see such determination is
reward enough for me.

578
01:05:24,133 --> 01:05:25,493
Have you ever been inside the Castle?

579
01:05:26,733 --> 01:05:27,493
No.

580
01:05:35,213 --> 01:05:39,053
I was restoring some stones up here
the other day when I found this.

581
01:05:41,413 --> 01:05:41,933
Hold on.

582
01:05:51,094 --> 01:05:52,054
An empty tomb?

583
01:05:52,734 --> 01:05:56,854
The Castle gates were locked during
the Great Plague. It's an escape route.

584
01:06:06,374 --> 01:06:07,294
Don't get stuck.

585
01:06:16,054 --> 01:06:16,934
Good luck

586
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:42,174
- You said you admired my work.
- Yes.

587
01:06:42,254 --> 01:06:43,494
Would you do me a favor?

588
01:06:43,574 --> 01:06:45,334
Another one?

589
01:06:46,614 --> 01:06:47,894
If I don't...

590
01:06:48,854 --> 01:06:52,334
...see you later, would you go to
my house, find my notebooks...

591
01:06:52,414 --> 01:06:55,854
and destroy them?
All my manuscripts...

592
01:06:55,894 --> 01:06:59,854
none of them are finished.
Just burn them, all right?

593
01:07:04,934 --> 01:07:06,814
What an extraordinary request.

594
01:07:09,934 --> 01:07:11,334
A true friend would do it.

595
01:07:11,414 --> 01:07:13,054
Not necessarily!

596
01:07:20,774 --> 01:07:22,134
A wife would!

597
01:10:48,056 --> 01:10:48,976
Are you lost?

598
01:10:49,056 --> 01:10:51,296
I'm looking for Medical Records.

599
01:10:51,376 --> 01:10:53,176
That's the yellow floor.

600
01:10:53,256 --> 01:10:54,936
Of course.

601
01:10:55,016 --> 01:10:56,296
Have I seen you here before?

602
01:10:57,896 --> 01:10:58,496
No

603
01:11:00,016 --> 01:11:01,496
I'm new.

604
01:11:07,776 --> 01:11:08,616
Grab him!

605
01:11:18,296 --> 01:11:18,936
Get his papers.

606
01:11:20,416 --> 01:11:21,616
I'm talking to you!
His papers!

607
01:11:31,976 --> 01:11:33,256
How many more of these tonight?

608
01:11:33,336 --> 01:11:34,696
Three, I think.

609
01:11:37,776 --> 01:11:38,896
We've been waiting.

610
01:11:38,936 --> 01:11:40,616
Getting him here wasn't easy.

611
01:11:41,376 --> 01:11:42,576
Help us get him prepared.

612
01:12:08,537 --> 01:12:10,497
All a bit much, don't you think?

613
01:12:12,537 --> 01:12:13,457
Uh, yes.

614
01:12:14,217 --> 01:12:16,857
It's the noise that gets to me.

615
01:12:18,377 --> 01:12:19,497
And the smell.

616
01:12:19,577 --> 01:12:20,937
Yes. Quite.

617
01:12:24,537 --> 01:12:25,777
You don't belong here, do you?

618
01:12:27,817 --> 01:12:32,617
Actually, no. I was on my way
to the Medical Records Division.

619
01:12:33,777 --> 01:12:35,177
I was just going that way myself.

620
01:12:42,937 --> 01:12:44,617
You pig!
Let me go!

621
01:12:44,697 --> 01:12:47,137
Now, Miss Rossman,
I want to chat with you.

622
01:12:47,977 --> 01:12:48,657
Miss Rossman?

623
01:12:51,177 --> 01:12:51,937
Do something.

624
01:12:54,857 --> 01:12:56,017
How do you feel, Miss Rossman?

625
01:13:01,657 --> 01:13:03,417
- I know you.
- Better.

626
01:13:04,777 --> 01:13:09,217
When it all comes down
you'll be the first to die.

627
01:13:10,537 --> 01:13:11,817
And you.

628
01:13:11,897 --> 01:13:14,097
We aren't making much progress today.

629
01:13:15,497 --> 01:13:17,337
You'll hang by the guts of the police.

630
01:13:17,377 --> 01:13:19,137
- You're incompetent.
- Let me try this.

631
01:13:27,337 --> 01:13:28,817
- What are you doing?
- Something's wrong.

632
01:13:40,097 --> 01:13:40,857
What were they doing there?

633
01:13:42,017 --> 01:13:46,017
Just between you and me... I'm supervisor.
On salary like anyone else.

634
01:13:46,097 --> 01:13:49,417
They're trying to come up with,
shall I say

635
01:13:50,137 --> 01:13:51,858
a more efficient person.

636
01:13:51,938 --> 01:13:53,338
I don't follow.

637
01:13:54,338 --> 01:13:58,498
What makes someone more prone to
anger or happiness or certain colors?

638
01:13:58,578 --> 01:14:01,018
The chemical balance can be altered.

639
01:14:02,218 --> 01:14:04,578
But in what ways? In what measure?
It's an impure science.

640
01:14:04,618 --> 01:14:07,218
I've seen some of their impurities.

641
01:14:07,298 --> 01:14:10,338
Haven't we all?
They do what they're told.

642
01:14:10,418 --> 01:14:12,298
That makes them "efficient"?

643
01:14:12,378 --> 01:14:15,058
First physiology, then ideology.

644
01:14:17,338 --> 01:14:18,698
Are you sure this is the right way?

645
01:14:21,218 --> 01:14:23,138
I must see the head of Medical Records.

646
01:14:24,258 --> 01:14:26,538
- He did summon you then?
- Yes.

647
01:14:27,258 --> 01:14:31,378
Interesting. There was another clerk
from the claims office... a bit like you...

648
01:14:31,458 --> 01:14:33,818
summoned but never arrived.

649
01:14:34,498 --> 01:14:36,578
No? Why not?

650
01:14:37,418 --> 01:14:38,378
They killed him, actually.

651
01:14:41,818 --> 01:14:42,538
Why?

652
01:14:51,818 --> 01:14:55,418
From what I heard, it was bookkeeping.

653
01:14:57,018 --> 01:14:58,218
Bookkeeping?

654
01:15:05,018 --> 01:15:08,978
You see, he was accidentally sent
the wrong piece of paper

655
01:15:10,778 --> 01:15:11,658
Piece of paper?

656
01:15:13,298 --> 01:15:14,898
How could that matter?

657
01:15:16,858 --> 01:15:19,978
It authorized compensation for a death
that hadn't yet occurred.

658
01:15:24,938 --> 01:15:26,058
Orlac.

659
01:15:29,938 --> 01:15:30,898
Yes, Kafka.

660
01:15:35,978 --> 01:15:37,418
Workers have wives and children.

661
01:15:39,258 --> 01:15:41,978
Unfortunately, it's the only way
to ensure future workers.

662
01:15:45,858 --> 01:15:47,858
We find it best

663
01:15:47,898 --> 01:15:51,258
when an insurance company like yours
gives them a small cash payment

664
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:53,219
when they lose their husbands.

665
01:15:53,899 --> 01:15:56,699
People want industry, progress.
we give it to them.

666
01:15:57,859 --> 01:16:00,579
That's body-snatching,
not progress.

667
01:16:01,779 --> 01:16:04,659
I think they called it
the "resurrection" business.

668
01:16:06,139 --> 01:16:08,339
I even resurrected myself, didn't I?

669
01:16:09,339 --> 01:16:10,459
Dr. Murnau.

670
01:16:12,179 --> 01:16:14,139
The heroic martyr of Orlac.

671
01:16:14,219 --> 01:16:17,539
We had to move on from there,
find subjects elsewhere.

672
01:16:18,819 --> 01:16:20,899
People who are less likely to object.

673
01:16:21,579 --> 01:16:22,819
Like Gabriela Rossman?

674
01:16:27,259 --> 01:16:29,659
Or people who
are already guilty of something.

675
01:16:50,379 --> 01:16:53,219
Why do you involve yourself
with anarchists?

676
01:16:54,379 --> 01:16:57,019
I would have preferred to see
one of your manuscripts.

677
01:16:58,619 --> 01:16:59,619
I mean it.

678
01:17:00,299 --> 01:17:03,659
Your work has been an inspiration to me,
what I've seen of it.

679
01:17:03,699 --> 01:17:06,259
Why don't you publish more often.

680
01:17:06,339 --> 01:17:09,499
Is it a certain laziness
with regard to composition?

681
01:17:10,419 --> 01:17:15,059
Or are you just one of
those writers with, how shall I say

682
01:17:15,979 --> 01:17:17,419
No use for an audience?

683
01:17:24,019 --> 01:17:24,779
Thank you.

684
01:17:39,419 --> 01:17:40,939
You despise someone like me

685
01:17:42,179 --> 01:17:43,859
because you despise
the modern. But...

686
01:17:43,939 --> 01:17:49,859
you're at the forefront of what is modern.
You write about it. Document it.

687
01:17:51,379 --> 01:17:57,140
Unlike you, though I have
chosen to embrace it.

688
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:22,540
That's our biggest headache.

689
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:25,180
Understanding the human mind.

690
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:28,540
You must admit we have that in common.

691
01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:31,300
You and I have nothing in common.

692
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:40,060
I've tried to write
nightmares, and you've...

693
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:43,580
...built one.

694
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:53,980
You have your tools, I have mine.

695
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:58,580
But we are men of vision, you and I.

696
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:02,580
That's what sets us apart from
the great faceless mass.

697
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:07,900
Faceless? There's a face!

698
01:19:25,980 --> 01:19:29,820
What will you say when the
great faceless mass comes calling...

699
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:33,380
...on its own initiative?

700
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,780
What will you say to them?

701
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:41,540
A crowd is easier to control
than an individual.

702
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:48,300
A crowd has a common purpose.

703
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:59,221
The purpose of the individual
is always in question.

704
01:20:00,981 --> 01:20:02,901
That's what you're
trying to eliminate.

705
01:20:04,061 --> 01:20:07,381
That which makes one human being
different from another.

706
01:20:10,021 --> 01:20:11,821
But you'll never...

707
01:20:12,701 --> 01:20:16,341
...never reach a man's soul...

708
01:20:18,061 --> 01:20:19,821
...through a lens.

709
01:20:24,461 --> 01:20:26,981
That depends on which end of
the microscope you're on.

710
01:20:53,821 --> 01:20:55,181
Stop him! Stop him!

711
01:23:00,302 --> 01:23:00,942
Boys!

712
01:23:02,062 --> 01:23:03,462
Get my feet, quickly!

713
01:23:03,502 --> 01:23:06,182
Get my feet! Get my feet!

714
01:23:07,902 --> 01:23:09,062
My feet!

715
01:23:13,502 --> 01:23:14,622
You idiots!

716
01:23:14,702 --> 01:23:16,302
Get up and stop this!

717
01:24:16,103 --> 01:24:16,583
Where were you?

718
01:24:16,663 --> 01:24:19,063
- Behind you. Did you get him?
- No, but I will.

719
01:24:21,383 --> 01:24:22,063
He's gone.

720
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:13,984
You had told us
Miss Rossman had disappeared.

721
01:26:15,864 --> 01:26:19,264
- Well, she has been found.
- Yes.

722
01:26:19,344 --> 01:26:20,904
We are recommending

723
01:26:22,384 --> 01:26:27,144
for the report
a verdict of suicide.

724
01:26:28,664 --> 01:26:30,344
What would be your opinion?

725
01:26:52,384 --> 01:26:53,304
Suicide.

726
01:26:55,144 --> 01:26:56,304
I'd have to agree.

727
01:26:57,264 --> 01:27:01,664
She was perhaps despondent
over the loss of her beloved Mr. Raban.

728
01:27:04,304 --> 01:27:05,464
That...

729
01:27:07,904 --> 01:27:12,744
...would account for it.

730
01:27:14,464 --> 01:27:15,504
You are

731
01:27:18,064 --> 01:27:20,224
You're very helpful, Kafka.

732
01:27:42,304 --> 01:27:46,024
You're early, for once.
The Chief Clerk wants to see you in his office.

733
01:28:06,665 --> 01:28:07,545
You wanted to see me?

734
01:28:07,625 --> 01:28:10,745
You should know,
I received two communications.

735
01:28:10,825 --> 01:28:13,625
The first summoning
you to the Castle

736
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:15,665
the second
countermanding the first.

737
01:28:17,745 --> 01:28:18,745
Did they say why, sir?

738
01:28:19,345 --> 01:28:23,385
My superiors have no obligation
to explain their directives to me.

739
01:28:23,985 --> 01:28:25,545
And certainly not to you.

740
01:28:29,745 --> 01:28:31,385
I see, sir. I just thought

741
01:28:31,465 --> 01:28:36,625
today might be different.

742
01:28:36,665 --> 01:28:39,305
Why should today be different?

743
01:29:20,585 --> 01:29:23,185
Dearest Father.

744
01:29:30,825 --> 01:29:35,705
I had always believed
that it is better to know the truth

745
01:29:36,585 --> 01:29:38,865
than to live in ignorance.

746
01:29:39,945 --> 01:29:42,905
Now I shall find out if I was right.

747
01:29:44,745 --> 01:29:51,705
I can no longer deny
that I am part of the world around me.

748
01:30:19,826 --> 01:30:27,426
Nor can I deny
despite our differences

749
01:30:29,386 --> 01:30:33,026
that I remain your son.

750
01:30:33,986 --> 01:30:38,546
And so I hope only that these late

751
01:30:39,466 --> 01:30:41,666
perhaps insignificant

752
01:30:42,226 --> 01:30:44,146
realizations

753
01:30:44,986 --> 01:30:47,386
might reassure us both a little

754
01:30:47,426 --> 01:30:51,386
and make our living

755
01:30:53,666 --> 01:30:55,946
and our dying

756
01:30:57,786 --> 01:31:01,026
easier

757
01:31:02,027 --> 01:31:05,027
