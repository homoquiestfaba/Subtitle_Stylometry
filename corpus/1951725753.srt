1
00:00:03,953 --> 00:00:07,946
(drumroll)

2
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:11,027
(rousing orchestral
fanfare playing)

3
00:00:19,569 --> 00:00:21,867
(fanfare ends)

4
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:41,780
(children laughing and playing)

5
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,534
(people cheering)

6
00:01:02,612 --> 00:01:05,103
You're playing like
a bunch of little girls!

7
00:01:07,183 --> 00:01:08,912
You're playing like a little girl!

8
00:01:09,018 --> 00:01:10,417
Good, good hustle.

9
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,455
Good hustle!

10
00:01:13,556 --> 00:01:17,788
Hustle!

11
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:23,055
What? Okay, I'm coming!
Sorry! Sorry! I'm sorry.

12
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,895
Excuse me!

13
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:25,933
We got to go.

14
00:01:26,035 --> 00:01:26,933
Sorry.
We've got to go!

15
00:01:27,036 --> 00:01:29,903
It's an emergency!

16
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:34,041
Come on, come on, buddy.

17
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:37,046
Hey!

18
00:01:38,114 --> 00:01:41,106
Joshua, let's go!

19
00:01:41,217 --> 00:01:42,946
Let's go, buddy.

20
00:01:43,052 --> 00:01:44,212
Josh!

21
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,548
Oh...

22
00:01:45,655 --> 00:01:47,145
Ah...

23
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:50,760
(horn blaring)

24
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,050
(baby crying)

25
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:01,495
(babies fussing and crying)

26
00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:18,714
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

27
00:03:28,424 --> 00:03:31,951
Oh, my little worm.

28
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:34,996
Oh, God, I love her so much.

29
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:39,126
Hello, sweetie.

30
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:42,033
She looks like...

31
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,730
She...

32
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,138
(laughing)

33
00:03:46,242 --> 00:03:49,143
(laughter continues)

34
00:03:49,245 --> 00:03:50,507
Look at this little...

35
00:03:50,613 --> 00:03:52,911
(laughing)

36
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:54,108
Hey.

37
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:57,050
Did it hurt, Mommy?

38
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:02,318
Oh, yeah, it did, but not anymore.

39
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:05,622
(piano playing gentle melody)

40
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:14,396
(piano continues playing)

41
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,471
Oh,you did?

42
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:18,734
- (speaking gibberish)
- (barks)

43
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,240
Oh, not you, Buster.

44
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,469
Oh, Buster!

45
00:04:21,577 --> 00:04:24,171
Baby, I thought we were
keeping him locked up.

46
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,508
Okay, okay.

47
00:04:25,615 --> 00:04:29,016
You been listening to Bartok?

48
00:04:29,118 --> 00:04:31,552
(playing gentle melody)

49
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:33,144
I'll see your Bartok

50
00:04:33,256 --> 00:04:38,421
and raise you one
Rodgers and Hammerstein.

51
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,996
You hammer any
of these nails yourself?

52
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:43,327
Uh, no, Dad, we had a contractor.

53
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:45,401
I can't imagine what that cost you.

54
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:47,765
Shame, nothing like putting
your own sweat into a home.

55
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,704
Oh, there's sweat in here,
believe me.

56
00:04:53,776 --> 00:04:58,213
HAZEL: By the way it's not rare
to have a grandmother

57
00:04:58,314 --> 00:05:00,544
stay and help with the newborn.

58
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,641
- Oh, no...
- It would be my pleasure.

59
00:05:02,752 --> 00:05:04,049
- No, Hazel.
- (baby fussing)

60
00:05:04,153 --> 00:05:05,745
We're fine.

61
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:07,049
Are you sure, Abby?

62
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:08,714
Yes, Mom, we'll be fine.

63
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:12,283
- Because, you should have help.
- (fussing)

64
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,453
No.

65
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:17,226
HAZEL: At least have a nanny.

66
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,198
I mean, isn't that what
rich people do in New York?

67
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:21,031
- Mom, we're fine, really.
- We're also not crazy

68
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:24,937
about this idea of
a stranger living here.

69
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,601
Well, you would hardly notice me.

70
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,575
(playing stops)

71
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:33,308
These ten little Indians
are all out of arrows.

72
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:37,113
Well, I hope you won't
make me sing, Ned.

73
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,279
A glorious light
should shine, Hazel.

74
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:40,617
(Hazel laughing)

75
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:41,883
You flatterer.

76
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:42,923
NED:
You know, I don't know

77
00:05:43,026 --> 00:05:44,220
if you were interested
in seeing a show.

78
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:45,521
I can get you tickets.

79
00:05:45,628 --> 00:05:48,392
HAZEL: I only want to see
one of your shows, Ned.

80
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:50,898
Well, you're three years
too late on that one.

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,934
Aw, but what a success.

82
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:54,799
(begins playing classical piece)

83
00:05:54,904 --> 00:05:57,702
Mmm, I suppose.

84
00:05:57,807 --> 00:06:01,470
Oh, this is the piece that he's
playing for the school recital.

85
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:05,673
Uh-huh. Can he play, like,
"Jesus is my Savior" or...

86
00:06:06,983 --> 00:06:08,644
BRAD:
I don't think so, Mom.

87
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:09,945
Oh, that's a shame.

88
00:06:10,053 --> 00:06:12,886
(continues playing)

89
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:15,787
Abby, do you think

90
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:18,690
you could part with that
bundle of joy for just a second?

91
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,592
I need some cuddle time.

92
00:06:20,696 --> 00:06:23,460
Oh!

93
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:29,562
Oh, precious little lady.

94
00:06:29,672 --> 00:06:31,572
Look at you!

95
00:06:31,674 --> 00:06:35,610
Oh, well, she sure has that
solid-as-a-rock Cairn chin,

96
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:37,110
doesn't she?

97
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:38,441
JOE:
You can tell she's salt of the earth.

98
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:39,606
You can just tell.

99
00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:44,482
So, sis... how is everything?

100
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:46,487
Fine, how are you?

101
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:48,614
I'm fine, how are you feeling?

102
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:51,716
I'm feeling fine.
I'm good... I am.

103
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,261
Neddy, I'm good, I'm great even.

104
00:06:53,362 --> 00:06:55,057
No blues? No blahs?

105
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,461
Nope.

106
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:59,091
'Cause I have some exquisite
medication I can get you.

107
00:06:59,202 --> 00:07:01,932
(laughs):
No, it's nothing like last time.

108
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:03,369
Nothing.

109
00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:04,872
Good.

110
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:08,740
(playing grows louder)

111
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,472
ABBY:
Joshua.

112
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,605
Do you think we could have
a little intermission?

113
00:07:12,715 --> 00:07:14,239
Hmm?

114
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,716
I wonder how many rats
live in this building?

115
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:17,751
Joshua.

116
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,014
I'm guessing at least a hundred.

117
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:20,282
Joshua!

118
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:24,792
Do you think we can keep
it quiet for the baby?

119
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:26,521
(muffled hammering)

120
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:27,857
HAZEL:
What's that?

121
00:07:27,964 --> 00:07:30,558
Lunch break is probably over.

122
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,531
That's, uh...

123
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:34,000
that's gut renovation
on the penthouse.

124
00:07:34,103 --> 00:07:35,331
JOE:
How charming.

125
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:39,340
You baptizing this one?

126
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:41,808
Oh, well, you know, since we
didn't baptize Joshua, we're...

127
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:43,811
ABBY:
Yeah, I think it's time for Lily's nap.

128
00:07:43,913 --> 00:07:45,471
So that's a no to baptism?

129
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:48,015
BRAD:
Uh, I think, you know, we're going to let

130
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:50,381
our kids make up their
own minds about religion.

131
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:53,250
Hey, why don't we all
sing Lily a sleep tight song?

132
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:54,789
ABBY:
Good idea.

133
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,586
NED:
Come on, everybody.

134
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:59,320
- Come on.
- All right.

135
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:02,397
BRAD:
It's going to be okay.

136
00:08:02,498 --> 00:08:05,899
It's okay, Ma.

137
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:07,902
- (single note plays on piano)
- (baby fussing)

138
00:08:08,004 --> 00:08:12,373
- (playing piano)
- # Twinkle, twinkle, little star #

139
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:16,809
# How I wonder what you are #

140
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:21,509
# Up above the world so high #

141
00:08:21,617 --> 00:08:25,781
# Like a diamond in the sky #

142
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:27,549
# Twinkle, twinkle...#

143
00:08:27,657 --> 00:08:30,023
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my Lord.

144
00:08:30,126 --> 00:08:33,721
Sorry. I'm sorry.

145
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:36,798
(Joshua retching)

146
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,070
BRAD:
You feeling better?

147
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,703
What's going on over here?

148
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:48,140
Did you feed Nero today?

149
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:50,474
Yeah?

150
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,774
Dad?

151
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:52,870
Yeah.

152
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:54,847
I don't like soccer.

153
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,818
I-I thought I did,

154
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,048
and I wanted to...
but I don't.

155
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:03,921
Oh...

156
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:07,484
Well, you know, that's...

157
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:10,065
that's okay, you know?

158
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:15,964
I don't like baseball either.

159
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:17,437
Well, that's all right.

160
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,599
You ch... you do something else.

161
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:22,109
You can do whatever you want.

162
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:23,109
You know?

163
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:25,305
Do you ever feel weird, Dad?

164
00:09:25,414 --> 00:09:27,006
Weird?

165
00:09:27,116 --> 00:09:28,674
Yeah, yeah, sometimes.

166
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:31,275
Like if I don't exercise
for a while

167
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:33,116
or wake up in the middle
of a dream...

168
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:38,182
or have too much
coffee or something.

169
00:09:38,294 --> 00:09:40,626
Do you ever feel weird about me?

170
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,788
(laughs softly)

171
00:09:41,897 --> 00:09:44,866
Your weird son?

172
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:47,968
No.

173
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,062
No, no, no, no, not at all.

174
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,538
Not at all.

175
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:55,099
You know that magic trick

176
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:56,940
where the magician puts
the person in the box

177
00:09:57,046 --> 00:09:59,446
and spins the box
and makes the person disappear?

178
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:00,572
Yeah?

179
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,344
I know how that trick is done.

180
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:05,181
If you look carefully, you can tell.

181
00:10:05,288 --> 00:10:07,188
Well, you know, hey,
maybe magic is your thing.

182
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,780
We could take you to a magic store.

183
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:10,825
Get you some tricks.

184
00:10:10,926 --> 00:10:14,157
You know, you don't have to love me.

185
00:10:14,263 --> 00:10:16,197
That's not like a rule or something.

186
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:17,288
But I do love you.

187
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,594
You're my son. You're my boy.

188
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,067
I'll always love you,
no matter what.

189
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:26,403
Okay?

190
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:35,279
(static clicking softly)

191
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,692
(low breathy sound over monitor)

192
00:10:45,461 --> 00:10:46,655
Brad.

193
00:10:46,762 --> 00:10:48,229
BRAD:
Mm?

194
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:49,229
Brad.

195
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:50,629
Hmm?

196
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,859
Do you hear that?

197
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:53,264
Hmm? What?

198
00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:55,360
I think there's someone
in the baby's room.

199
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:56,699
(static clicking softly)

200
00:10:56,806 --> 00:10:58,797
No, that's static, sweetie.

201
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,603
No, there's someone in Lily's room.

202
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,905
Abby, wait a second.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

203
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:05,003
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

204
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:06,342
Sweetie?

205
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:08,781
Abby.

206
00:11:08,884 --> 00:11:11,910
Damn it.

207
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:20,287
She's breathing, right?

208
00:11:20,396 --> 00:11:21,556
She's fine, sweetie.

209
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:24,292
She's fine.

210
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,767
I thought she was choking
or something.

211
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,930
It's amazing how tiny they are.

212
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,338
ABBY:
It's almost heartbreaking.

213
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,746
(piano music begins playing
classical piece)

214
00:11:59,268 --> 00:12:02,237
(piano continues playing)

215
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:09,568
(baby cooing)

216
00:12:12,014 --> 00:12:13,914
Hey, did you walk the dog?

217
00:12:14,016 --> 00:12:15,984
Okay, let's roll, little man.

218
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,817
(mumbles)

219
00:12:19,922 --> 00:12:21,549
(baby fussing)

220
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,919
Oh.

221
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:25,186
Oh, don't cry.

222
00:12:25,294 --> 00:12:27,159
(piano continues playing)

223
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,891
Um, yeah, put it on the...
put it on the desk.

224
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,193
All right, thanks a lot.

225
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,665
Listen, hey, I'm running late.

226
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:35,032
I got to... Okay.

227
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:36,468
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?

228
00:12:36,572 --> 00:12:38,233
High five. Down low.

229
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,138
Two. Hey, hey, come on.

230
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:42,369
You all right?

231
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:43,843
Okay.

232
00:12:43,946 --> 00:12:45,914
I'll see you later.

233
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:48,481
Hey!

234
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:51,280
(continues playing
classical piece)

235
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:03,330
Did you solve them all already?

236
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:06,299
(piano continues playing)

237
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:09,929
And ten million's the minimum
for this particular fund.

238
00:13:11,307 --> 00:13:13,571
Of course... of course
we would love your support,

239
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:14,870
but ten is the number.

240
00:13:14,977 --> 00:13:16,569
It's not six.

241
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:17,873
(mumbles)

242
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,039
(whispers)

243
00:13:22,117 --> 00:13:23,482
Yeah.

244
00:13:23,586 --> 00:13:26,555
(piano continues playing)

245
00:13:28,023 --> 00:13:31,652
(slide projector clicks)

246
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,752
WOMAN:
Okay, now let's

247
00:13:34,864 --> 00:13:36,855
take a moment talking
about how and why

248
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:38,729
these ancient people
embalmed their dead.

249
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:39,892
BOY:
Mummies?

250
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:42,027
Yes, mummies.

251
00:13:58,821 --> 00:14:00,118
(laughs)

252
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:02,486
Oh, you're like a bird
trapped in a garage.

253
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,024
Yeah. That's...

254
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:05,684
Come on.
Serve.

255
00:14:05,794 --> 00:14:07,523
(whistle blows)

256
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,599
(piano continues playing)

257
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:24,475
(piano continues playing)

258
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,893
(door opening)

259
00:14:38,994 --> 00:14:40,586
(piano playing stops)

260
00:14:41,664 --> 00:14:44,258
(resumes playing,
finishes piece)

261
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:45,856
(keys clattering)

262
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:50,203
(Brad humming)

263
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,774
Hey.

264
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,069
Hey, I didn't see you there.

265
00:14:54,176 --> 00:14:55,541
ABBY:
Brad...

266
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,134
- BRAD: Sweetie, I'm...
- It ricochets.

267
00:14:57,246 --> 00:14:58,372
I'm cultured, I swear.

268
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,970
- (laughing)
- See?

269
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:01,549
(baby coos)

270
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,948
God.

271
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:05,714
You know,
someone died in this apartment.

272
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:06,879
BRAD:
Oh, yeah?

273
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,685
Really?

274
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:12,022
I-I-I... I'm pretty sure
that's not true.

275
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,152
If you think
about it,

276
00:15:14,263 --> 00:15:16,163
someone has died

277
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:18,927
on pretty much every inch
of this planet.

278
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:21,628
You know, dig down anywhere,
and you'll find bones.

279
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:22,931
(Abby laughs)

280
00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:25,131
ABBY:
I don't know. I thinkyou...

281
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,107
We'd probably know if
someone was killed here.

282
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,609
I didn't say killed.

283
00:15:29,712 --> 00:15:32,545
Why do you think killed?

284
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:34,548
Do you have that sense, too?

285
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,515
(Brad chewing loudly)

286
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:38,814
Nobody died here, man.

287
00:15:38,921 --> 00:15:40,013
Are you sure?

288
00:15:40,122 --> 00:15:41,350
ABBY (laughing):
I'm pretty sure.

289
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:42,651
Kind of sure.

290
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:43,816
(baby cooing)

291
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:45,120
What? Tell him about it.

292
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:46,319
(talking gibberish)

293
00:15:46,428 --> 00:15:49,056
Tell him about your shots.

294
00:15:49,164 --> 00:15:50,631
She had her shots today.

295
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:51,700
BRAD:
Oh,yeah?

296
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,198
Yeah. She was so good.

297
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:54,633
- I was a mess, however.
- Ah...

298
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:56,432
Oh, you poor thing.

299
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,733
What was I like as a baby?

300
00:15:58,841 --> 00:15:59,899
BRAD:
You were great.

301
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:00,976
You were... you were very, uh...

302
00:16:01,076 --> 00:16:03,203
You had a lot of... spirit.

303
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:05,109
- (clears throat)
- (laughs)

304
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,841
You certainly knew
what you wanted,

305
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:08,143
that's for sure.

306
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,444
What did I want?

307
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,018
Ah...

308
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,520
We could never tell.

309
00:16:13,622 --> 00:16:16,250
But I was all right?

310
00:16:16,358 --> 00:16:17,723
You...

311
00:16:17,826 --> 00:16:19,088
Yeah.

312
00:16:19,194 --> 00:16:20,388
ABBY (laughing):
You were fine.

313
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:21,986
BRAD:
You were great.

314
00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:23,257
You really were.

315
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:26,425
You were a good kid.

316
00:17:00,969 --> 00:17:02,994
(baby crying)

317
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:06,973
BRAD: Oh, yes, here we are
with Joshua, eight days old.

318
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:08,441
BRAD:
Mommy... and son.

319
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:10,944
ABBY:
Brad, what are you doing?

320
00:17:11,046 --> 00:17:14,379
BRAD (upper crust accent): I'm just trying
to get a slice of life here, you see.

321
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:15,541
Well, not now.

322
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:17,118
Please just get out of here.

323
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:18,777
(shushing baby)

324
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:21,856
BRAD: Mommy's very tired,
very tired, and she's trying to...

325
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,185
ABBY:
Brad, fuck off.

326
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,817
BRAD:
Just give a little... Okay. Okay.

327
00:17:25,928 --> 00:17:27,122
Just leave me alone right now.

328
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:28,423
BRAD:
Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay.

329
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,792
(baby crying)

330
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:31,627
BRAD (whispers):
I'll stop, I'll stop, I'll stop.

331
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:33,725
BRAD:
And here we are behind the scenes

332
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:36,168
- with Brad and Abby Cairn.
- (baby crying and screaming)

333
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:37,329
- Hello, Mommy!
- Brad...

334
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:38,872
BRAD:
Okay, okay, okay...

335
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,305
- (baby screams)
- BRAD: Ow!

336
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:41,842
ABBY:
Get out!

337
00:17:41,944 --> 00:17:44,208
(baby crying)

338
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,837
(Abby sniffles)

339
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:52,548
(baby crying)

340
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:53,780
(Abby inhales deeply)

341
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:56,153
ABBY:
I'm fine, I'm fine.

342
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:59,227
(crying):
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

343
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,386
I'm fine.

344
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,522
(exhales loudly)

345
00:18:03,632 --> 00:18:07,363
(whispers): I'm fine. I'm fine,
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine.

346
00:18:07,469 --> 00:18:09,164
(Abby sniffles, baby cries)

347
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,301
(baby crying)

348
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:16,707
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

349
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:18,837
(baby crying)

350
00:18:20,883 --> 00:18:23,784
(loud static)

351
00:18:23,886 --> 00:18:25,854
(volume increases)

352
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,020
(crowd murmuring)

353
00:18:31,126 --> 00:18:32,616
(laughing):
What's going on with you?

354
00:18:32,728 --> 00:18:35,356
MAN:
Hey, it's the new parents.

355
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:37,364
- BRAD: Hey, how you been?
- Brad!

356
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:39,331
BRAD:
Fred, Ruth, how you guys doing? Hey...

357
00:18:39,434 --> 00:18:41,129
- Hello, Abernathys.
- WOMAN: Hello.

358
00:18:41,236 --> 00:18:42,294
Where you guys been?

359
00:18:42,404 --> 00:18:43,632
- South Africa.
- BRAD: Oh, nice.

360
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:45,366
My mother finally died.

361
00:18:45,474 --> 00:18:46,532
Oh, sorry.

362
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:47,734
The weather was unbelievable.

363
00:18:47,843 --> 00:18:49,777
I caught the biggest
shark you've ever seen.

364
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,743
- Mm. Really...?
- WOMAN: So, how's the new girl?

365
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:52,905
It's Lily, right?

366
00:18:53,015 --> 00:18:54,209
ABBY:
Yeah. She's good.

367
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:55,874
You look fabulous.

368
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:57,144
- Yeah.
- BRAD: No kidding.

369
00:18:57,252 --> 00:18:58,947
- Thank you.
- BRAD: What do you use for...?

370
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,749
- Well, you finally had another. That's great.
- Yeah.

371
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:02,983
MAN: It took me three hours
to bring in that shark.

372
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:04,149
Hey, how's Tommy?

373
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:05,726
Well, we'll see. Uh...

374
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:07,193
The trumpet was a real mistake.

375
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:08,661
There is a reason

376
00:19:08,764 --> 00:19:10,732
- that nobody plays the trumpet.
- (laughter)

377
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,961
So, are we all prepared for
an hour of unspeakable music?

378
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,094
Speak for your own child.

379
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:19,538
I tell you, two kids really
changes everything, huh?

380
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:21,165
- (Abby clears throat)
- MAN: Try three.

381
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:22,334
(laughs)

382
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:23,968
All right, we'll see you out there.

383
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,307
- Okay.
- Break a leg.

384
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,382
- Okay.

385
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:28,540
(sighs)

386
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,947
I hate these people.

387
00:19:30,052 --> 00:19:32,213
(whispers)
Shh, shh, shh, shh. Hey, keep it down.

388
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:33,720
(sighs):
Are we these people?

389
00:19:33,822 --> 00:19:35,016
It's just a school, baby.

390
00:19:35,123 --> 00:19:36,181
Hey, bullshit.

391
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,758
It is not just a school.

392
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,418
- It's a way of life.
- Shh, shh.

393
00:19:39,528 --> 00:19:41,792
And we're smack dab
in the middle of it.

394
00:19:41,897 --> 00:19:43,728
- Hi.
- Hey.

395
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:46,960
(sighs)

396
00:19:47,069 --> 00:19:48,536
(whispers):
There he is.

397
00:19:48,637 --> 00:19:49,763
Sorry, I'm late, sis.

398
00:19:49,872 --> 00:19:50,998
Yeah, whatever.

399
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,505
You're right on time.

400

# Ave Maria #

403

Little Star" fluidly)

408
00:20:56,738 --> 00:20:59,172

What's he doing?

409
00:20:59,274 --> 00:21:00,366
(plays a wrong note)

410
00:21:00,475 --> 00:21:02,841
Uh, I don't know.

418
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:27,428
(plays fluidly)

419
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,595

discordant notes)

420
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,639
(plays more discordant notes)

421
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,571
(plays many atonal notes)

422
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,151
BRAD:
This is... This is...

423
00:21:44,252 --> 00:21:46,049
This is all...
This is all wrong.

424
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,653
No. Actually, I think he's...

425
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:52,352
he's hitting every note.

426
00:21:52,461 --> 00:21:54,861
(playing atonal music)

427
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,591

(plays atonal music
loudly and confidently)

430
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,313
(music crescendos)

431
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,134
ABBY:
Joshua? Oh,Joshua...

432
00:22:34,236 --> 00:22:35,703

panicked voices)

Excuse me!

BRAD:
You all right?

436
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:45,637
Hey, hey.

437
00:22:45,747 --> 00:22:46,805
- ABBY: You okay?
- You're okay.

438
00:22:46,915 --> 00:22:48,143
He's okay.
You okay, buddy?

439
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,444
Say something.

440
00:22:49,551 --> 00:22:51,246
- You okay?
- Come on, buddy, let's go.

441
00:22:51,353 --> 00:22:53,116
Bring him...Just let me bring him.

442
00:22:53,221 --> 00:22:55,985
MAN:
First I thought he was kidding around with...

443
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:59,652
(sighs heavily)

444
00:22:59,761 --> 00:23:01,490
What were you doing up there?

445
00:23:01,596 --> 00:23:03,359
You were probably just nervous, huh?

446
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,659
NED:
Hey,

447
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:07,530
I threw up the first time
I ever went on stage.

448
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,160

449
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:10,465

- Hey, hey, hey.

450
00:23:10,572 --> 00:23:11,834
Goddamn it.

451
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,602
Will you not drive like
a fucking idiot, please?!.

452
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:17,234
(sighs)

453
00:23:17,345 --> 00:23:19,176

Honey, honey, honey.

Honey, honey, honey, honey.

- What's wrong?
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

465
00:23:54,282 --> 00:23:55,772
Nothing. She just started crying.

466
00:23:55,884 --> 00:23:57,249
- What did you do?
- Shh, shh.

467
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,444
I didn't do anything. I...

468
00:23:58,553 --> 00:23:59,781
Well, she's fine.

469
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:01,879
- I fed her not too long ago.
- Shh, shh, shh.

470
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,582
- Here... No, no, no.

- She's fine.
- What's going on with her?

474
00:24:09,064 --> 00:24:10,895
Is it night terrors or something?
What's happening?

475
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:12,660
No. She's fine,
she's fine, she's fine.

476
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:13,825
She doesn't like it...

477
00:24:13,935 --> 00:24:15,493
She likes it when you
support her h...

478
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:16,935
She's fine, she's fine.
I'm fine, okay?!.

479
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,096
I can handle this.

480
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,106
Just go to bed!

481
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,506
(baby crying)

482
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,369
Okay. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,243
Come on, baby...

-Jesus.

486
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,358
Oh God, you scared the...

487
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,360
tar out of me.

488
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:42,089
Everything all right?

489
00:24:42,197 --> 00:24:45,325
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

490
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:46,491
How're you feeling?

491
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:48,501
You feel, you feel better?

492
00:24:48,603 --> 00:24:49,968
She's crying.

493
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,629
Yes, she is.

494
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,798
(chuckles)

495
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,399
Come on, buddy,
back to bed, let's go.

496
00:24:56,478 --> 00:24:58,378
(baby crying)

497
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,210
So how long has she been crying now?

498
00:25:01,316 --> 00:25:03,216
- Uh, five days.
- Hmm.

499
00:25:03,318 --> 00:25:05,718
Yeah, she has a slight diaper rash.

500
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,151
You think that, that's it?

501
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,813
- Could that be it?
- Well...

502
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,414
you know, um...

503
00:25:10,525 --> 00:25:13,016
some babies just like to cry.

504
00:25:13,128 --> 00:25:14,527
- (crying continues)
- Yeah.

505
00:25:14,629 --> 00:25:16,529
Here you go.

506
00:25:16,631 --> 00:25:18,531
(crying continues)

507
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:20,533
Not this, not again.

508
00:25:20,635 --> 00:25:22,535
Not, not this one.

509
00:25:22,637 --> 00:25:24,537
You know, she was,
she was perfect

510
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:26,539
until five days ago.

511
00:25:26,641 --> 00:25:28,541
Maybe she just has a lot to say.

512
00:25:28,643 --> 00:25:30,543
- (crying continues)
- Okay.

513
00:25:30,645 --> 00:25:32,636
Could you take her for a second?

514
00:25:32,747 --> 00:25:34,681
Yeah, sure.

515
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,751
(crying continues)

516
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,942

519
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:42,209
(rock on headphones)

520
00:26:54,663 --> 00:26:56,358
Where have you been?

521
00:26:57,632 --> 00:26:59,623
Hey, what's...

522
00:26:59,734 --> 00:27:01,725
(baby crying)

523
00:27:01,836 --> 00:27:03,861
What is that, is that the,
is that the baby

524
00:27:03,972 --> 00:27:05,200
- or the dog?
- Or me?

525
00:27:05,307 --> 00:27:06,535
- What?
- Take a deep breath, Brad.

526
00:27:06,641 --> 00:27:07,869
That's our life you're smelling.

527
00:27:07,976 --> 00:27:09,102
Give me the binky.

528
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,177
Wait.

529
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:12,872
Good God, ma...

530
00:27:12,981 --> 00:27:15,245
Mommy's upset, huh?

531
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,910
- (crying continues)
- Oh, no, little baby.

532
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:19,577
Look we have the binky.

533
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:21,246
The binky's here.

534
00:27:21,356 --> 00:27:22,584
There's the binky.

535
00:27:22,691 --> 00:27:23,680
Yeah.

536
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:25,760

Shh, shh, shh, shh,

538
00:27:37,972 --> 00:27:39,940
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

(softly cries)

540
00:27:45,647 --> 00:27:47,205
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

541
00:27:47,315 --> 00:27:49,215
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

542
00:27:49,317 --> 00:27:51,285
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

543
00:28:04,132 --> 00:28:06,100
(door creaking)

544
00:28:14,342 --> 00:28:16,242
Hey, pal.

545
00:28:16,344 --> 00:28:18,244
Hi.

546
00:28:18,346 --> 00:28:19,745
What's going on here?

547
00:28:19,848 --> 00:28:21,076
What areyou...

548
00:28:21,182 --> 00:28:23,082
what are you doing
with all your stuff?

549
00:28:23,184 --> 00:28:25,084
I'm giving it away,

550
00:28:25,186 --> 00:28:27,086
- to the poor.
- (chuckles)

551
00:28:27,188 --> 00:28:29,156
You're giving it away to the poor?

552
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:30,986
Every one of your toys?

553
00:28:31,092 --> 00:28:33,925
Josh...

554
00:28:34,028 --> 00:28:36,929
You know, these,
these toys aren't cheap.

555
00:28:37,031 --> 00:28:38,931
I'm starting over.

556
00:28:39,033 --> 00:28:40,022
Starting over?

557
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,159
From what?

558
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:42,327
Mom said I could.

559
00:28:42,437 --> 00:28:44,997
Mom said you could.

560
00:28:45,106 --> 00:28:47,370
Uh-huh.

561
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,909
Yeah, of course she did, well...

562
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:52,980
at least you're keeping Pandy.

563
00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:58,443
Dad, is Mommy all right?

564
00:28:58,553 --> 00:29:00,453
Yeah, yeah,

565
00:29:00,555 --> 00:29:02,455
she's just tired, pal.

566
00:29:02,557 --> 00:29:04,457
Why do you ask?

567
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,459
Nothing.

568
00:29:06,561 --> 00:29:08,256
Lily asleep?

569
00:29:08,363 --> 00:29:10,263
Yeah, I got her to fall asleep.

570
00:29:10,365 --> 00:29:11,423
Pretty good, huh?

571
00:29:11,533 --> 00:29:13,433
You're better at it than Mommy.

572
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:15,002
(laughs)

573
00:29:15,103 --> 00:29:16,536
I'm not sure about that.

574
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:18,128
You are. Really.

575
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:20,173
What's going on with your hair here?

576
00:29:20,275 --> 00:29:22,835
Huh, what is it, made of plastic?

577
00:29:22,944 --> 00:29:25,344
Hey, I know things have
been kind of stressful

578
00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:27,142
around here lately.

579
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:30,217
It can't be easy for you.

580
00:29:31,886 --> 00:29:33,786
You okay?

581
00:29:33,888 --> 00:29:35,788
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

582
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,790
What areyou...
what are you doing?

583
00:29:37,892 --> 00:29:38,950
In Egypt,

584
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,960
when they embalmed
people, like pharaohs,

585
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:42,962
they broke the nose
and removed the brain

586
00:29:43,064 --> 00:29:44,964
through the opening.

587
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:46,465
Ahh.

588
00:29:46,568 --> 00:29:48,468
(chuckling):
Josh, that's...

589
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,470
They drained the body
of all its fluid

590
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:52,836
on a special stone slab.

591
00:29:52,941 --> 00:29:54,408
Josh...

592
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:56,238
Josh,Josh,

593
00:29:56,344 --> 00:29:57,902
Josh, wh-wh-why are you doing that?

594
00:29:58,012 --> 00:29:59,570
Why... don't...

595
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:02,650
This guarantees him
a glorious afterlife.

596
00:30:05,987 --> 00:30:08,956
(humming)

597
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:12,759
They chanted
something, too,

598
00:30:12,861 --> 00:30:14,761
but I'm making that part up.

599
00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:16,897
(grunting)

600
00:30:16,998 --> 00:30:18,898
Filthy animal.

601
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,900
You filthy, filthy animal.

602
00:30:21,002 --> 00:30:23,061
Oh...

603
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:25,139
That's right.

604
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,367
You're a disgusting dog.

605
00:30:27,475 --> 00:30:28,703
(panting)

606
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,539
No, no, Brad!

607
00:30:30,645 --> 00:30:32,374
- Huh?
- Buster.

608
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,538
No!

609
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:34,706
What's wrong?

610
00:30:34,816 --> 00:30:36,306
- (barking)
- All right, come on, come on.

611
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,475
Come on, Buster.

612
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,553
Let's go, come on.

613
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,226
I mean can't your parents take him?

614
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:48,694
No.

615
00:30:48,796 --> 00:30:50,696
They can't take him.

616
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:52,026
(sobbing)

617
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:54,101
What's wrong, sweetie?

618
00:30:55,336 --> 00:30:57,395
Nice that everything is quiet.

619
00:30:57,505 --> 00:30:58,904
Ugh, are you kidding me?

620
00:30:59,007 --> 00:31:00,907
I still hear her echo.

621
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:03,409
Sweetie, what's, what's going on?

622
00:31:03,511 --> 00:31:05,035
You okay?

623
00:31:05,146 --> 00:31:07,046
I love you bunches.

624
00:31:07,148 --> 00:31:08,547
I love ya.

625
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,708
(sighs)

626
00:31:09,817 --> 00:31:11,444
Sweetie.

627
00:31:11,553 --> 00:31:13,453
Look at this, this is beautiful.

628
00:31:13,555 --> 00:31:16,319
All right, come on, that's my side.

629
00:31:16,424 --> 00:31:17,755
Let's go.

630
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:19,190
I'm gonna take a look at this.

631
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,057
Let me get, let me get
a little slice of this.

632
00:31:21,162 --> 00:31:22,595
(sighing):
Please.

633
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:23,755
Don't worry
about Lily,

634
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:25,264
I'm gonna feed her tonight, okay.

635
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:27,425
Okay, but you have
to warm the breast milk.

636
00:31:27,535 --> 00:31:29,503
No problem.

637
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:33,131
You look so good.

638
00:31:33,241 --> 00:31:34,640
Look at this, voluptuous.

639
00:31:34,742 --> 00:31:35,970
This is so nice.

640
00:31:36,077 --> 00:31:37,977
That's Latin for fat pig.

641
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:40,309
No, baby, this is
just good clean fun.

642
00:31:40,415 --> 00:31:41,643
This is beautiful.

643
00:31:41,749 --> 00:31:43,307
It's love.

644
00:31:43,418 --> 00:31:45,318
Come on, sweetie.

645
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,320
Not in the mood, huh?

646
00:31:47,422 --> 00:31:50,323
Oh, we can't have sex anyway.

647
00:31:50,425 --> 00:31:52,325
Well, we can do other things.

648
00:31:52,427 --> 00:31:54,327
You know, like...

649
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:55,987
- (skittering upstairs)
- stuff.

650
00:31:56,097 --> 00:31:57,325
You know...

651
00:31:57,432 --> 00:31:58,490
Do you hear that?

652
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,500
What?

653
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:02,661
I think someone's upstairs.

654
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,829
Yeah, well, maybe
it's the owners

655
00:32:04,939 --> 00:32:06,497
checking up on the progress.

656
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:08,337
At 10:30?

657
00:32:08,443 --> 00:32:10,206
You know I love the
smell of your pits.

658
00:32:10,311 --> 00:32:11,642
- Brad...
- Maybe it's rats, I don't know.

659
00:32:11,746 --> 00:32:13,077
Maybe, there's got
to be a hundred

660
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,341
in this building.

661
00:32:14,449 --> 00:32:15,848
- Don't worry about it.
- No, not now, okay.

662
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,248
May- Maybe soon but not now.

663
00:32:21,389 --> 00:32:23,289
Okay.

664
00:32:23,391 --> 00:32:25,359
- (sighs)
- (exhales)

665
00:32:34,402 --> 00:32:37,303
(distant phone rings)

666
00:32:37,405 --> 00:32:39,373
(exhales)

667
00:32:40,575 --> 00:32:42,543
Hey!

668
00:32:43,578 --> 00:32:45,569
Not good, huh?

669
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,409
No, no, it was...

670
00:32:47,515 --> 00:32:49,073
It was an aggressive position,

671
00:32:49,183 --> 00:32:50,343
but it'll work out.

672
00:32:50,451 --> 00:32:52,316
- I hope.
- Hey, I got to take off

673
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,478
- early.
- Yeah?

674
00:32:53,588 --> 00:32:54,646
Yeah.

675
00:32:54,756 --> 00:32:55,586
Reason?

676
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,248
Teacher-parent meeting.

677
00:32:57,358 --> 00:32:58,518
Send the nanny,

678
00:32:58,626 --> 00:32:59,524
that's what I do.

679
00:32:59,627 --> 00:33:00,889
(laughing):
That's funny.

680
00:33:00,995 --> 00:33:02,292
Not a joke.

681
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:05,730
It'll be up a point
by the time the market closes.

682
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:06,891
Now that is a joke.

683
00:33:07,001 --> 00:33:08,628
It's... I'll see you tomorrow.

684
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:09,862
(chuckles)

685
00:33:09,971 --> 00:33:12,940
Thanks, pal.

686
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:16,242
(baby crying)

687
00:33:16,344 --> 00:33:18,312
(Abby sighs)

688
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,717
(mumbling):
I don't know.

689
00:33:26,521 --> 00:33:28,421
- I don't know what it is.
- Mmm.

690
00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:30,923
You pick her up
and she cries,

691
00:33:31,025 --> 00:33:32,925
you put her down and she cries.

692
00:33:33,027 --> 00:33:34,927
I don't know.

693
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:36,997
I don't know why you just
don't hire a nanny.

694
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,123
Get Mary Poppins for Christ's sake.

695
00:33:39,233 --> 00:33:41,394
Did Brad put you up to this?

696
00:33:41,502 --> 00:33:43,231
No.

697
00:33:43,337 --> 00:33:44,736
I'm just saying you need a break.

698
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:47,273
Go... shopping, go out to dinner.

699
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:49,605
Go get a hotel room and take a nap.

700
00:33:49,711 --> 00:33:51,611
Just get out of here
for a little while.

701
00:33:51,713 --> 00:33:52,907
It'll do everybody some good.

702
00:33:53,014 --> 00:33:56,074
I could never leave her
with anybody else.

703
00:33:56,184 --> 00:33:58,618
Have you spoken to your shrink?

704
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,620
So sick of shrinks.

705
00:34:00,722 --> 00:34:03,691
I've given them 17 years,
what have they given me?

706
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:04,849
A migraine.

707
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,290
I'm just saying
you got to stay

708
00:34:06,394 --> 00:34:07,588
on top of these things.

709
00:34:07,695 --> 00:34:09,925
Speaking from personal experience.

710
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:13,091
I mean, I'm a little worried here.

711
00:34:13,201 --> 00:34:16,102
(distant baby crying)

712
00:34:16,204 --> 00:34:18,104
Look at this.

713
00:34:18,206 --> 00:34:20,436
Look at this, maybe I'm...

714
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:23,169
maybe I'm not providing for her.

715
00:34:23,277 --> 00:34:25,575
Well, that's quite a device.

716
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,148
It looks like you're giving
oxygen to your tit.

717
00:34:29,217 --> 00:34:31,276
Shut up.

718
00:34:31,385 --> 00:34:32,647
Oh, I was kidding.

719
00:34:32,754 --> 00:34:33,812
No, you shut up!

720
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:35,479
Oh, please.

721
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,490
- (crying)
- I was kidding.

722
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:40,993
Look, it's not all that bad.

723
00:34:41,095 --> 00:34:42,995
And it's... shh.

724
00:34:43,097 --> 00:34:44,655
It's gonna get better.

725
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:46,233
This is the slog.

726
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,767
This is the slog, right?

727
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:50,269
Soon enough our little
Lily's gonna be adorable

728
00:34:50,371 --> 00:34:53,272
and all of this is
gonna be forgotten.

729
00:34:53,374 --> 00:34:55,342
(crying stops)

730
00:34:58,946 --> 00:35:00,914
See.

731
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,918
ABBY:
Oh, God, please.

732
00:35:07,388 --> 00:35:09,288
Hi, honey.

733
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,948
Joshua, my boy.

734
00:35:11,058 --> 00:35:12,992
Can I go out for a bit, Mom?

735
00:35:13,094 --> 00:35:16,689
- Sure.
- Off to bury the evidence, huh?

736
00:35:16,798 --> 00:35:18,698
ABBY:
Where are you going?

737
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,563
I have some more toys for Goodwill.

738
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:24,627
Okay, but just come home
right afterwards, yeah?

739
00:35:28,476 --> 00:35:31,707
You let him walk the
streets by himself,

740
00:35:31,813 --> 00:35:32,871
at nine years old?

741
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,208
Oh, come on.

742
00:35:34,315 --> 00:35:36,545
I mean, does he seem like
your typical nine-year-old?

743
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:38,619
Yeah, I suppose not.

744
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:44,990
BRAD:
Mrs., uh...

745
00:35:45,092 --> 00:35:46,787
DANFORTH:
Ms. Danforth.

746
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:47,952
Ms. Danforth, hi..

747
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,188
- Yes, hi..
- Hi..

748
00:35:49,297 --> 00:35:50,355
Yeah, I'm sorry I'm late.

749
00:35:50,464 --> 00:35:51,931
Oh, no that's fine.

750
00:35:52,033 --> 00:35:53,091
I, uh...

751
00:35:53,201 --> 00:35:54,998
got tied up.

752
00:35:55,102 --> 00:35:56,501
Hey, which one's his desk?

753
00:35:56,604 --> 00:35:57,935
Oh, it's right here.

754
00:35:58,039 --> 00:35:59,438
Front and center.

755
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,337
Oh, well, that's good,
eager beaver, huh?

756
00:36:01,442 --> 00:36:02,670
(giggles)

757
00:36:02,777 --> 00:36:04,574
Um... yeah.

758
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:06,146
Oh, um,

759
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,714
can I ask a question, Ms. Danforth?

760
00:36:07,815 --> 00:36:09,043
Yes, Mr. Cairn.

761
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,050
- (giggles)
- (chuckles)

762
00:36:11,152 --> 00:36:13,052
Joshua, he's, uh...

763
00:36:13,154 --> 00:36:14,553
How smart is he?

764
00:36:14,655 --> 00:36:17,215
Well, this might be getting
ahead of ourselves,

765
00:36:17,325 --> 00:36:19,259
but we think Joshua
might benefit

766
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,418
by skipping a grade,

767
00:36:20,528 --> 00:36:22,257
maybe two.

768
00:36:22,363 --> 00:36:24,263
Hmm.

769
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:26,265
Yeah, we're so different.

770
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:28,267
Me and my son.

771
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:29,597
My son and I...

772
00:36:29,704 --> 00:36:32,229
I-I-I, uh...

773
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,308
You know, I'd probably
be the kid in the class

774
00:36:34,408 --> 00:36:36,740
who picked on him
'cause he was different.

775
00:36:38,813 --> 00:36:42,214
Hey, where are the
animals in the...?

776
00:36:42,316 --> 00:36:45,046
Oh, a couple of weeks
ago, they all died.

777
00:36:45,152 --> 00:36:48,053
It was a horrible day.

778
00:36:48,155 --> 00:36:50,089
Oh, that is horrible.
What happened?

779
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:54,150
We think maybe there was
a fungus in the food pellets.

780
00:36:54,262 --> 00:36:57,197
We've contacted the manufacturer.

781
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:00,927
In fact, we're using it as
an exercise in consumer rights.

782
00:37:02,436 --> 00:37:04,370
(baby crying)

783
00:37:05,406 --> 00:37:07,374
(crying continues)

784
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:13,847
(crying)

785
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:29,616
(glass breaking)

786
00:38:32,493 --> 00:38:35,223
Clumsy, Abby.

787
00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:38,628
Yeah, she's so clumsy
when she's tired.

788
00:38:55,182 --> 00:38:57,582
Mm-hmm.

789
00:38:57,685 --> 00:38:58,811
You were right.

790
00:39:00,888 --> 00:39:02,321
There are ghosts here.

791
00:39:05,893 --> 00:39:07,861
Everywhere there are ghosts.

792
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:13,724
Um...

793
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:16,701
Joshua, um,

794
00:39:16,804 --> 00:39:18,271
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

795
00:39:19,306 --> 00:39:20,398
I'm sorry.

796
00:39:20,508 --> 00:39:22,601
Come here.

797
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:25,372
(glass crunching, gasps)

798
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:29,279
Oh.

799
00:39:33,187 --> 00:39:37,248
Oh... oh, God.

800
00:39:38,325 --> 00:39:40,953
Poor, clumsy Abby.

801
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,661
(glass drops)

802
00:39:48,769 --> 00:39:50,896
Oh.

803
00:39:51,005 --> 00:39:52,495
Oh, I feel it.

804
00:39:52,606 --> 00:39:56,940
You know, and it
feels kind of prickly.

805
00:39:59,013 --> 00:40:01,413
Hmm.

806
00:40:01,515 --> 00:40:05,417
Oh... oh, yeah.

807
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:08,647
You know, I used to have
a pair of red boots.

808
00:40:10,191 --> 00:40:12,989
My God, they were so sexy.

809
00:40:37,218 --> 00:40:38,947
- (door closes)
- Hey.

810
00:40:39,053 --> 00:40:41,112
Hey. How are you, sis?

811
00:40:41,222 --> 00:40:42,951
I'm so glad you could come.

812
00:40:43,057 --> 00:40:45,025
15 stitches.

813
00:40:47,061 --> 00:40:49,029
She's a trooper.

814
00:40:51,065 --> 00:40:52,464
I can, I can stay.

815
00:40:52,566 --> 00:40:53,692
No, no, no, go home.

816
00:40:53,801 --> 00:40:55,291
Go home, we'll be fine.

817
00:40:55,402 --> 00:40:57,029
We're good, get some sleep.

818
00:40:58,072 --> 00:41:00,097
I'll see you later.

819
00:41:01,108 --> 00:41:03,941
(piano plays)

820
00:41:35,543 --> 00:41:37,272
(door opens)

821
00:41:37,378 --> 00:41:38,504
BRAD:
Hello?

822
00:41:38,612 --> 00:41:39,909
(door closes)

823
00:41:40,981 --> 00:41:43,711
(keys rattle)

824
00:41:43,817 --> 00:41:45,375
Hey, hey, buddy.

825
00:41:45,486 --> 00:41:48,785
What you doing?

826
00:41:48,889 --> 00:41:51,949
Huh?

827
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:53,959
Scoot over.

828
00:41:54,061 --> 00:41:55,460
Is Mommy going to get better?

829
00:41:55,563 --> 00:41:56,461
Yes, she will.

830
00:41:56,564 --> 00:41:59,294
Look what I got.
I got you a book.

831
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,834
Valley of the Kings.

832
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,631
Pretty cool, huh?

833
00:42:05,005 --> 00:42:06,233
You like that?

834
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,069
Thank you so much.

835
00:42:08,175 --> 00:42:10,405
You're welcome so much.

836
00:42:10,511 --> 00:42:12,479
You know, people
say the Met,

837
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,638
but the Brooklyn Museum's

838
00:42:13,747 --> 00:42:15,738
the place to go for Egyptian art.

839
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:17,942
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

840
00:42:18,052 --> 00:42:19,952
Your father's a wealth
of information.

841
00:42:20,054 --> 00:42:21,954
You didn't know that, did you?

842
00:42:22,056 --> 00:42:23,990
Maybe we'll go sometime.

843
00:42:26,527 --> 00:42:27,926
Hey, there she is.

844
00:42:28,028 --> 00:42:29,086
Hi, sweetie.

845
00:42:29,196 --> 00:42:30,754
- How are ya?
- How're you doing?

846
00:42:30,864 --> 00:42:32,092
I'm good.
You look tired.

847
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:33,427
- Oh.
- (mumbles gibberish)

848
00:42:33,534 --> 00:42:34,933
(laughs)

849
00:42:35,035 --> 00:42:36,593
How are they doing?

850
00:42:36,704 --> 00:42:38,171
Good and it's fine here.

851
00:42:38,272 --> 00:42:39,762
Everything is quiet.

852
00:42:39,873 --> 00:42:42,603
Lily settled down, Abby's in bed.

853
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,268
You should take a nap, too.

854
00:42:44,378 --> 00:42:46,005
- Yeah.
- It's the weekend, for heaven sakes.

855
00:42:46,113 --> 00:42:47,944
Go on and get some sleep.

856
00:42:48,048 --> 00:42:49,379
I appreciate you
coming all this way.

857
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,451
Please, will you go have a rest?

858
00:42:51,552 --> 00:42:53,179
Thanks, but I'm not tired.

859
00:42:53,287 --> 00:42:56,848
- Look, I'm here so you can relax.
- Okay.

860
00:42:58,926 --> 00:43:01,486
ABBY:
Hazel, I don't need another goddamn thing.

861
00:43:01,595 --> 00:43:03,119
Hey, hey, hey, ooh.

862
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:05,198
Slow down. It's me.

863
00:43:06,634 --> 00:43:08,693
How's your foot?

864
00:43:08,802 --> 00:43:11,862
It's fine.

865
00:43:11,972 --> 00:43:13,200
Are you pumping?

866
00:43:13,307 --> 00:43:14,535
Yeah, I'm pumping.

867
00:43:14,642 --> 00:43:16,200
You know,
if your saint of a mother's

868
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,210
going to be feeding
Lily at night,

869
00:43:18,312 --> 00:43:20,212
she's going to need some milk.

870
00:43:20,314 --> 00:43:22,339
Abby...

871
00:43:23,417 --> 00:43:24,816
Don't take Lily away from me.

872
00:43:24,918 --> 00:43:26,715
Of course not, of course
I'm not going to take her...

873
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:29,288
She needs me, not some
dried up old sponge.

874
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,290
Abby, Abby, Abby.

875
00:43:31,392 --> 00:43:33,383
Sweetie.

876
00:43:33,494 --> 00:43:35,655
Y-you...

877
00:43:35,763 --> 00:43:38,493
Let's all try to get along,
you know what I mean?

878
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:40,726
Come on.

879
00:43:40,834 --> 00:43:42,461
I know, I know.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

880
00:43:42,569 --> 00:43:43,900
She's here to help.

881
00:43:44,004 --> 00:43:45,733
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

882
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,807
I got your prescriptions.

883
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,410
This is for your foot,

884
00:43:55,516 --> 00:43:58,280
and this is going to makeyou...

885
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,012
feel better.

886
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,180
It'll help your, uh...

887
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:05,224
You know what I mean?

888
00:44:07,261 --> 00:44:10,230
Can I breast-feed?

889
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,099
No.

890
00:44:14,201 --> 00:44:16,863
No, sweetie,
but this is,

891
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:18,198
this is just a hurdle.

892
00:44:18,305 --> 00:44:20,239
Abby, you know, once you get
over this hurdle,

893
00:44:20,341 --> 00:44:22,332
you can ease off the medication.

894
00:44:22,443 --> 00:44:23,705
You can start breast-feeding again.

895
00:44:23,811 --> 00:44:26,041
It's just a few weeks,
maybe a month.

896
00:44:26,146 --> 00:44:28,114
That's all.

897
00:44:31,985 --> 00:44:34,078
I'm going to take care
of everything, you know?

898
00:44:34,188 --> 00:44:36,088
I'm going to take
care of the laundry.

899
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:37,521
I'm going to take care of Lily.

900
00:44:37,624 --> 00:44:39,353
Don't you worry.

901
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:42,554
Okay?

902
00:44:42,663 --> 00:44:43,857
Mommy, Daddy?

903
00:44:43,964 --> 00:44:46,057
Hey, sport.

904
00:44:46,166 --> 00:44:47,895
I'm going to go and walk the dog.

905
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:49,229
Okay, sport.

906
00:44:49,336 --> 00:44:50,997
Just around the block.

907
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,369
-JOSHUA: Mommy, Daddy?
- Yeah?

908
00:44:53,474 --> 00:44:55,442
I love you.

909
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:06,582
When did you start
calling him "sport"?

910
00:45:10,391 --> 00:45:12,359
(keyboard clacking)

911
00:45:40,087 --> 00:45:42,612
(clears throat):
Hey.

912
00:45:42,723 --> 00:45:44,691
- Tough week, huh?
- Yeah.

913
00:45:44,792 --> 00:45:45,759
(blows raspberry)

914
00:45:45,859 --> 00:45:46,951
I think it's getting better.

915
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:50,052
I mean, Lily's slowly
figuring life out.

916
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,495
And I think Abby's
starting to see

917
00:45:51,598 --> 00:45:52,963
the light at the end of the tunnel.

918
00:45:53,066 --> 00:45:54,055
I don't know.

919
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,362
Excuse me?

920
00:45:55,469 --> 00:45:58,666
I mean, all in all, I'm positive.

921
00:45:58,772 --> 00:46:00,672
Oh, well, I am so relieved.

922
00:46:00,774 --> 00:46:03,174
See I thought
we were losing money

923
00:46:03,277 --> 00:46:04,437
hand over fist.

924
00:46:04,545 --> 00:46:06,274
I thought we were
on the verge

925
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:09,349
of losing a year's gains
in the matter of a month.

926
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:10,849
I thought we were fucked.

927
00:46:10,951 --> 00:46:13,181
But as long
as everybody's happy

928
00:46:13,287 --> 00:46:15,812
at home, then I just-
I feel so much better.

929
00:46:15,923 --> 00:46:18,357
Okay, uh, I know it looks bad.

930
00:46:18,459 --> 00:46:19,619
It is bad!

931
00:46:19,726 --> 00:46:21,785
Our long is looking short!

932
00:46:21,895 --> 00:46:23,328
Okay, okay.
But we've got to sit tight.

933
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:24,692
It's just a little sell-off

934
00:46:24,798 --> 00:46:27,289
and then it'll be a big buyback.

935
00:46:27,401 --> 00:46:31,132
It's gonna work out, Chester.

936
00:46:31,238 --> 00:46:33,866
It's gonna get better.

937
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,846
Hazel, you don't have to do that.

938
00:46:41,949 --> 00:46:43,712
Oh, I enjoy it.

939
00:46:43,817 --> 00:46:47,218
I'm having a grand old time.

940
00:46:47,321 --> 00:46:49,789
And where is Lily?

941
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,358
- Napping.
- Oh.

942
00:47:00,934 --> 00:47:02,902
(muttering)

943
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,009
(distant pounding, whirring)

944
00:47:20,187 --> 00:47:21,620
(racquetball bouncing)

945
00:47:23,657 --> 00:47:26,649
(cell phone ringing)

946
00:47:29,329 --> 00:47:31,024
- Fuck!
- Sorry.

947
00:47:31,131 --> 00:47:33,361
Sorry.

948
00:47:33,467 --> 00:47:35,435
(phone continues ringing)

949
00:47:39,873 --> 00:47:41,841
Yeah?

950
00:48:11,905 --> 00:48:13,873
(door unlocks)

951
00:48:18,779 --> 00:48:20,178
Where, where is he?

952
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,748
He's in the kitchen, sweetie.

953
00:48:28,555 --> 00:48:29,852
(bag drops)

954
00:48:37,064 --> 00:48:41,125
(sobbing):
Oh, Buster.

955
00:48:43,103 --> 00:48:44,001
Hey, pal.

956
00:48:44,104 --> 00:48:47,767
(sniffling)

957
00:48:47,874 --> 00:48:51,742
Oh, no.

958
00:48:52,779 --> 00:48:55,907
(sobbing)

959
00:49:06,426 --> 00:49:09,452
(imitating Brad):
Oh, Buster.

960
00:49:09,563 --> 00:49:15,763
(sniffling):
Hey, pal.

961
00:49:17,771 --> 00:49:19,636
No!

962
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:23,676
(sobbing)

963
00:49:30,117 --> 00:49:32,415
Well, what should we do for food?

964
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:33,508
I-I don't know.

965
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:35,247
I'm not going into that kitchen.

966
00:49:35,355 --> 00:49:36,253
They'll be here soon.

967
00:49:36,356 --> 00:49:38,017
Did he eat anything in the park?

968
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:43,085
Joshua? Hey.

969
00:49:43,196 --> 00:49:45,721
Did-did he eat anything in the park?

970
00:49:45,832 --> 00:49:48,960
Anything peculiar at all?

971
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:50,627
No.

972
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:52,705
And then you took him right home?

973
00:49:54,608 --> 00:49:55,575
(snapping fingers):
Josh?

974
00:49:55,676 --> 00:49:57,576
- Did you take him right home?
- Yeah.

975
00:49:57,678 --> 00:49:59,578
(Lily begins crying)

976
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,080
Did you give him anything at all?

977
00:50:02,182 --> 00:50:03,649
Did you give him anything?

978
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,012
Brad, he was an old dog.

979
00:50:05,118 --> 00:50:11,387
Every dog has its day, and
Buster had a shitty fucking day.

980
00:50:11,491 --> 00:50:13,015
(doorbell buzzing)

981
00:50:13,126 --> 00:50:14,889
Join the club.

982
00:50:14,995 --> 00:50:17,054
(Lily crying)

983
00:50:17,164 --> 00:50:20,759
(doorbell buzzing)

984
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,008
Wait, wait, wait.

985
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,606
(unzipping)

986
00:50:37,718 --> 00:50:41,814
We should keep this.

987
00:50:41,988 --> 00:50:44,855
(Lily crying)

988
00:50:52,933 --> 00:50:57,165
(Lily crying over monitor)

989
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:02,006
(thumping and pounding overhead)

990
00:51:11,585 --> 00:51:13,951
Brad?

991
00:51:14,054 --> 00:51:15,351
Yeah, sweetie?

992
00:51:15,455 --> 00:51:17,616
You have to come home right now.

993
00:51:17,724 --> 00:51:19,885
They're coming through the ceiling.

994
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,893
(drilling and hammering)

995
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:24,020
Hmm?

996
00:51:24,131 --> 00:51:27,328
They're coming through the ceiling.

997
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:32,165
Hi!

998
00:51:33,406 --> 00:51:35,704
Hi, sweetie.

999
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:39,872
We have to hurry.

1000
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,140
Okay.

1001
00:51:46,586 --> 00:51:49,555
W-where is it?
Is it in the bathroom?

1002
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,621
I don't understand. Is it...

1003
00:51:55,729 --> 00:51:59,597
Uh... I'm sorry? Where?

1004
00:52:06,473 --> 00:52:08,941
Shit.

1005
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:11,943
Uh-huh.

1006
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,273
There's nothing?

1007
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,369
No, I mean, uh...

1008
00:52:16,449 --> 00:52:18,178
There's a crack up there,
but I mean,

1009
00:52:18,285 --> 00:52:19,582
that crack has been there forever.

1010
00:52:19,686 --> 00:52:20,710
Is everything okay?

1011
00:52:23,924 --> 00:52:24,982
Because I've got to...

1012
00:52:25,091 --> 00:52:28,925
I've got to be at Midtown...
for the...

1013
00:52:29,029 --> 00:52:30,587
- (sobbing)
- What's going on?

1014
00:52:30,697 --> 00:52:34,258
Look at me.

1015
00:52:34,367 --> 00:52:35,664
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1016
00:52:35,769 --> 00:52:39,102
It's okay, but now I've got to go.

1017
00:52:39,206 --> 00:52:41,106
(sighing)

1018
00:52:41,208 --> 00:52:43,574
Sweetie.

1019
00:52:43,677 --> 00:52:45,110
I'm so sorry.

1020
00:52:45,212 --> 00:52:46,304
I'm sorry.

1021
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,437
I love our kids.

1022
00:52:47,547 --> 00:52:49,845
I love our kids, too.

1023
00:53:08,802 --> 00:53:12,169
Reach to Him, the hand
that is always there!

1024
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,206
The hand of Jesus.

1025
00:53:14,307 --> 00:53:15,740
He is always there!

1026
00:53:15,842 --> 00:53:19,039
Reach to Him
and He will embrace you!

1027
00:53:19,145 --> 00:53:20,874
He will prepare you.

1028
00:53:20,981 --> 00:53:24,473
He will arm you
with the sword of righteousness

1029
00:53:24,584 --> 00:53:28,680
so you will not have
to fight this battle alone!

1030
00:53:32,592 --> 00:53:34,787
(sawing and hammering)

1031
00:53:39,165 --> 00:53:43,465
(sawing and hammering
grows louder)

1032
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:46,334
We have big news.

1033
00:53:46,439 --> 00:53:47,804
Good news.

1034
00:53:47,908 --> 00:53:48,806
What is it?

1035
00:53:48,909 --> 00:53:50,672
Joshua.

1036
00:53:50,777 --> 00:53:52,745
I want to get born again.

1037
00:53:52,846 --> 00:53:53,744
(laughing)

1038
00:53:53,847 --> 00:53:55,212
You what?

1039
00:53:55,315 --> 00:54:00,116
I took Joshua to
a prayer meeting today

1040
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,154
and he was touched by the spirit.

1041
00:54:02,255 --> 00:54:03,813
Weren't you, son?

1042
00:54:03,924 --> 00:54:06,415
And he wants to get
right with Christ.

1043
00:54:06,526 --> 00:54:08,687
Well, too bad his mom
is a big, fat Jew.

1044
00:54:08,795 --> 00:54:09,819
Mom.

1045
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:12,455
Well, his father is
a proud, strong Christian.

1046
00:54:12,565 --> 00:54:14,123
And Joshua made this
decision for himself.

1047
00:54:14,234 --> 00:54:15,667
Mom...

1048
00:54:15,769 --> 00:54:17,930
- I'm-I'm sorry, but that's not happening.
- No.

1049
00:54:18,038 --> 00:54:19,767
Well, you said it was his decision.

1050
00:54:19,873 --> 00:54:23,536
And he's old enough now
to make that decision.

1051
00:54:23,643 --> 00:54:25,110
Mom, I think we have some say.

1052
00:54:25,211 --> 00:54:27,372
Well, you said
that it was his decision.

1053
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,777
- ABBY: You fucking bitch.
- Mom.

1054
00:54:28,882 --> 00:54:30,440
- Abby, Abby, Abby.
- No, no, no, no.

1055
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:31,881
No! No!
No child of mine

1056
00:54:31,985 --> 00:54:34,112
is going to grow up to be
a goddamn Evangelical nutcase.

1057
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:35,118
Okay, okay.

1058
00:54:35,221 --> 00:54:36,449
Okay, Abby.

1059
00:54:36,556 --> 00:54:38,183
No! You've been whispering
poison into his ears.

1060
00:54:38,291 --> 00:54:40,156
You fucking narrow-minded
medieval scold.

1061
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:41,227
Abby! Abby!

1062
00:54:41,328 --> 00:54:43,796
You know, Abby,
I feel sorry for you.

1063
00:54:43,897 --> 00:54:45,387
That motherhood is such a chore.

1064
00:54:45,498 --> 00:54:46,396
You know what?

1065
00:54:46,499 --> 00:54:48,126
Get out of my house!

1066
00:54:48,234 --> 00:54:51,533
Okay, okay, let's-let's turn down
the volume a little bit here, okay?

1067
00:54:51,638 --> 00:54:52,832
You know, maybe
you should try Christ

1068
00:54:52,939 --> 00:54:54,065
instead of all those pills.

1069
00:54:54,174 --> 00:54:55,573
You know what? Get out!

1070
00:54:55,675 --> 00:54:57,404
Ow!

1071
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:01,879
Calm down, calm down.

1072
00:55:01,982 --> 00:55:03,074
(sobbing)

1073
00:55:03,183 --> 00:55:05,617
It's always a battle,Joshua.

1074
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:09,280
Just hold tight to your sword.

1075
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:12,324
BRAD:
Mom, I'm just saying he's young.

1076
00:55:12,425 --> 00:55:15,826
He doesn't know, he doesn't know
what he wants yet, okay?

1077
00:55:15,929 --> 00:55:17,863
And he's reading the...
the Bible!

1078
00:55:17,964 --> 00:55:19,955
And my-my-my wife,

1079
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:22,125
just as things are
starting to get good...

1080
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,862
now I've got to medicate her...

1081
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:26,404
because... because
you crossed the line.

1082
00:55:26,506 --> 00:55:27,871
Now is not the time, Mom.

1083
00:55:27,974 --> 00:55:29,134
I-I need you here.

1084
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:30,368
Wait a second.
Wait a sec.

1085
00:55:30,477 --> 00:55:32,377
Wait one second, little man.

1086
00:55:32,479 --> 00:55:35,004
Now I want you to listen.

1087
00:55:35,115 --> 00:55:38,175
I have been quiet and nice
the last few weeks.

1088
00:55:38,284 --> 00:55:41,082
But now I have something to say.

1089
00:55:41,187 --> 00:55:43,985
This is no place for a family.

1090
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,058
This is not a home.

1091
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:47,490
This is my home.

1092
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:49,084
No, this is a house.

1093
00:55:49,195 --> 00:55:52,494
It's an apartment.

1094
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,658
(sniffling):
It's not a home.

1095
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:55,860
Okay.

1096
00:55:55,969 --> 00:55:59,336
All this shouting
and this rage and anger,

1097
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:01,737
you know, that infects
a soul, Bradley.

1098
00:56:01,841 --> 00:56:04,139
You know that.

1099
00:56:04,244 --> 00:56:06,576
Regardless of God.

1100
00:56:06,679 --> 00:56:08,010
Okay, okay, okay.

1101
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,672
So stop acting
like a boy,

1102
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,546
and start acting like a man.

1103
00:56:11,651 --> 00:56:16,054
And take care of your family!

1104
00:56:16,156 --> 00:56:18,056
You leave New York.

1105
00:56:18,158 --> 00:56:19,591
You come home.

1106
00:56:19,692 --> 00:56:23,651
You've been playing
city long enough.

1107
00:56:23,763 --> 00:56:27,324
It's time to grow up, Bradley.

1108
00:56:27,434 --> 00:56:30,460
Once and for all.

1109
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:32,162
(footsteps approaching)

1110
00:56:36,776 --> 00:56:37,936
(sighs)

1111
00:56:38,044 --> 00:56:40,342
So, you love Jesus, huh?

1112
00:56:42,449 --> 00:56:44,781
Go to bed.

1113
00:56:44,951 --> 00:56:47,078
(indistinct crowd chatter,
birds chirping)

1114
00:56:50,256 --> 00:56:52,349
(distant chatter
of children)

1115
00:56:56,229 --> 00:56:59,096
(children screaming
and chattering)

1116
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:01,190
MAN:
Can you help me out, little man?

1117
00:57:01,301 --> 00:57:03,929
Just something.

1118
00:57:04,037 --> 00:57:07,336
Anything.

1119
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,374
I'm no chooser here.

1120
00:57:09,476 --> 00:57:11,535
(children shouting)

1121
00:57:15,381 --> 00:57:18,748
I'll give you five dollars
if I can throw a rock at you.

1122
00:57:22,489 --> 00:57:23,683
(door opening)

1123
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:24,882
NED:
Knock, knock.

1124
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,117
(gasps)

1125
00:57:26,226 --> 00:57:28,660
Hello, hello, hello!

1126
00:57:28,761 --> 00:57:29,819
(laughs)

1127
00:57:29,929 --> 00:57:31,226
Hazel, are
you ready

1128
00:57:31,331 --> 00:57:33,322
for your big night out on the town?

1129
00:57:33,433 --> 00:57:34,661
(laughs)

1130
00:57:34,767 --> 00:57:36,667
Dinner at Joe Allen's
followed

1131
00:57:36,769 --> 00:57:38,930
by the magic of...

1132
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,562
The Lion King.

1133
00:57:40,673 --> 00:57:42,300
(laughing):
Oh, Ned.

1134
00:57:42,408 --> 00:57:44,569
I can't wait. Uh...

1135
00:57:44,677 --> 00:57:48,704
Let me just, uh,
quickly fix my face.

1136
00:57:53,086 --> 00:57:54,280
(horn honks)

1137
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:56,184
BRAD:
Honey, I can't...

1138
00:57:56,289 --> 00:57:59,258
I can't get home right now, okay?

1139
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:01,589
I'm expecting a thing of beauty.

1140
00:58:01,694 --> 00:58:04,390
Sleep tight.

1141
00:58:04,497 --> 00:58:06,658
Hi. You know I...
You know I told you

1142
00:58:06,766 --> 00:58:08,461
I need to nail this tomorrow, right?

1143
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:11,036
You know, I told you this
a million times, right?

1144
00:58:11,137 --> 00:58:13,332
Joshua's fine, everyone's fine.

1145
00:58:13,439 --> 00:58:15,703
Okay, listen to me,
listen to me, listen, listen.

1146
00:58:15,808 --> 00:58:16,968
Shh, shh, shh, listen, listen.

1147
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:19,306
Just be the wonderful mother
that you are, okay?

1148
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:21,175
And everything's going
to be just fine.

1149
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:23,112
- I got to go, okay?
- (baby crying through phone)

1150
00:58:23,216 --> 00:58:25,946
Just... I got to go,
I got to go. I love you.

1151
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,485
Hey.

1152
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,318
(inhales and exhales deeply)

1153
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:33,483
(sniffles)

1154
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,188
- (gasps)
- Mommy?

1155
00:58:38,298 --> 00:58:40,664
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1156
00:58:48,374 --> 00:58:50,365
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1157
00:58:53,713 --> 00:58:55,772
(door squeaking)

1158
00:59:05,325 --> 00:59:06,917
(heavy sigh)

1159
00:59:07,026 --> 00:59:08,687
Ah, she finally fell asleep.

1160
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,854
(laughs)

1161
00:59:12,332 --> 00:59:15,495
(shallow breathing)

1162
00:59:15,602 --> 00:59:18,036
Are you okay, Mommy?

1163
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:20,128
Yeah,yeah.

1164
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,639
I just...
(sniffles)

1165
00:59:21,741 --> 00:59:23,072
Mommy's just being silly.

1166
00:59:23,176 --> 00:59:24,370
(laughs)

1167
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:25,739
You know, hormones.

1168
00:59:25,845 --> 00:59:26,903
What moans?

1169
00:59:27,013 --> 00:59:28,503
(laughs)

1170
00:59:28,615 --> 00:59:30,242
N-Never mind.

1171
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:31,408
(inhales shallow breath)

1172
00:59:32,619 --> 00:59:33,745
So...

1173
00:59:33,853 --> 00:59:36,981
Are we safe, Mommy?

1174
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:39,650
Well, what do you mean?

1175
00:59:39,759 --> 00:59:42,250
Does Daddy love me?

1176
00:59:42,362 --> 00:59:44,796
Of course he loves you.

1177
00:59:44,897 --> 00:59:46,956
Yes, he loves you very, very much.

1178
00:59:47,066 --> 00:59:48,966
Yeah.

1179
00:59:49,068 --> 00:59:50,399
But not like a mommy.

1180
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,769
(sighs heavily)

1181
01:00:09,622 --> 01:00:10,953
Can we play together?

1182
01:00:11,057 --> 01:00:12,422
(sniffles
loudly)

1183
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:14,891
Yeah. Yeah, let's play a game, huh?

1184
01:00:14,994 --> 01:00:17,053
What do you want to
play, backgammon?

1185
01:00:17,163 --> 01:00:18,528
Hide-and-seek.

1186
01:00:18,631 --> 01:00:20,155
Hide-and-seek?

1187
01:00:20,266 --> 01:00:23,394
Oh. Well, I...

1188
01:00:23,503 --> 01:00:25,630
Okay, fine.

1189
01:00:25,738 --> 01:00:27,569
Good. I'll hide, you seek.

1190
01:00:27,674 --> 01:00:29,539
Yeah, I figured as much.

1191
01:00:29,642 --> 01:00:32,406
You close your eyes and count to 50.

1192
01:00:32,512 --> 01:00:33,706
Okay.

1193
01:00:33,813 --> 01:00:35,405
And Mommy?

1194
01:00:35,515 --> 01:00:37,449
Yeah?

1195
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,882
No peeking.

1196
01:00:39,986 --> 01:00:41,453
Okay.

1197
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:42,612
(sniffles loudly)

1198
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:43,780
(sighs)

1199
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:46,688
One, two, three,

1200
01:00:46,793 --> 01:00:48,727
four, five,

1201
01:00:48,828 --> 01:00:51,194
six, seven,

1202
01:00:51,297 --> 01:00:54,164
eight, nine, ten,

1203
01:00:54,267 --> 01:00:56,292
11, 12,

1204
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:58,302
13,

1205
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:00,872
14, 15...

1206
01:01:08,681 --> 01:01:11,047
45, 46,

1207
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:14,142
47, 48,

1208
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:18,383
49...

1209
01:01:18,491 --> 01:01:20,516
50!

1210
01:01:20,626 --> 01:01:23,094
Ready or not, here I come.

1211
01:01:31,537 --> 01:01:33,698
I'm going to get you.

1212
01:01:36,642 --> 01:01:38,633
Are you here?

1213
01:01:45,084 --> 01:01:46,847
Where are you?

1214
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:55,325
(creaking)

1215
01:01:57,563 --> 01:02:00,828
(singsongy):
Where are you?!.

1216
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:06,736
Huh?

1217
01:02:12,211 --> 01:02:14,202
Where are you?

1218
01:02:29,629 --> 01:02:31,597
(sighs)

1219
01:02:39,138 --> 01:02:41,129
Joshua!

1220
01:02:46,112 --> 01:02:48,080
(sighs)

1221
01:02:51,551 --> 01:02:53,519
(door creaking)

1222
01:03:05,665 --> 01:03:09,032
You know how to get a-a
Polish guy out of a tree?

1223
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:11,730
(laughs)

1224
01:03:11,838 --> 01:03:13,669
A one-armed Polish
guy out of a tree.

1225
01:03:13,773 --> 01:03:14,967
I-I already messed it up.

1226
01:03:15,074 --> 01:03:16,166
(phone ringing)

1227
01:03:16,275 --> 01:03:17,902
(laughs):
You wave to him.

1228
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:19,272
That's a...
little ditty I...

1229
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:20,868
(laughs)

1230
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:22,811
- (phone beeps on)
- Hello. What's up?

1231
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:26,513
What?

1232
01:03:26,619 --> 01:03:28,314
Joshua!

1233
01:03:28,421 --> 01:03:30,412
Where are you?!.

1234
01:03:30,523 --> 01:03:32,650
(crying)

1235
01:03:32,758 --> 01:03:34,817
Oh.

1236
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,131
(sighs)

1237
01:04:10,663 --> 01:04:13,131
(door squeaks, Abby panting)

1238
01:04:13,232 --> 01:04:15,564
(groaning and gasping in pain)

1239
01:04:18,871 --> 01:04:21,465
(door closes)

1240
01:04:21,574 --> 01:04:23,633
(panting)

1241
01:04:53,539 --> 01:04:55,564
(panting)

1242
01:04:59,111 --> 01:05:01,170
(door creaking)

1243
01:05:03,616 --> 01:05:05,914
(panting)

1244
01:05:07,053 --> 01:05:09,180
(creaking)

1245
01:05:11,557 --> 01:05:13,821
Honey?

1246
01:05:15,094 --> 01:05:17,119
(boards creaking)

1247
01:05:18,598 --> 01:05:20,031
(sighs)

1248
01:05:20,132 --> 01:05:22,100
Lily?

1249
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,307
(boards creaking)

1250
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:32,003
Lily?!.

1251
01:05:37,383 --> 01:05:39,544
(heavy door slamming)

1252
01:05:43,889 --> 01:05:45,447
(door creaking)

1253
01:05:45,558 --> 01:05:48,322
Oh, Christ.

1254
01:05:48,427 --> 01:05:50,554
(door opening)

1255
01:05:52,131 --> 01:05:54,326
(panting)

1256
01:05:56,836 --> 01:05:59,430
(door creaking)

1257
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:02,869
Abby, you in here?

1258
01:06:02,975 --> 01:06:05,671
(Brad panting)

1259
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:10,079
Sweetie?

1260
01:06:11,784 --> 01:06:13,843
(panting)

1261
01:06:15,254 --> 01:06:17,222
Abby?

1262
01:06:19,925 --> 01:06:21,392
Sweetie?

1263
01:06:21,494 --> 01:06:22,984
(panting)

1264
01:06:23,095 --> 01:06:25,063
Oh, baby.

1265
01:06:26,666 --> 01:06:27,724
(boards creaking)

1266
01:06:27,833 --> 01:06:29,858
Oh, sweetie.

1267
01:06:29,969 --> 01:06:32,767
It's okay.

1268
01:06:32,872 --> 01:06:34,134
It's okay.

1269
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,901
Everything's fine.

1270
01:06:36,008 --> 01:06:38,772
You're going to be okay, sweetie.

1271
01:06:39,812 --> 01:06:41,871
You're going to be okay.

1272
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:45,277
Everything's going to be okay.

1273
01:06:45,384 --> 01:06:47,352
You're okay.

1274
01:06:49,221 --> 01:06:51,121
You're my angel.

1275
01:06:51,223 --> 01:06:54,317
You're my little angel.

1276
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:57,555
Hey, kiddo, you okay?

1277
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:59,893
- (moans)
- Shh!

1278
01:06:59,999 --> 01:07:01,830
It's okay, sweetie.

1279
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:03,401
It's okay.

1280
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:06,230
It's okay.

1281
01:07:06,338 --> 01:07:08,306
Did you get hurt?

1282
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:13,844
Are you hurt?

1283
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:16,414
Lily's fine.
See, look.

1284
01:07:16,515 --> 01:07:17,777
She's asleep in her crib.

1285
01:07:17,883 --> 01:07:20,317
She's fine. See?

1286
01:07:20,419 --> 01:07:23,183
- Okay?
- You!

1287
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,347
Sweetie, sweetie.

1288
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:26,015
You!

1289
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:28,252
Did you even look for me, Mommy?

1290
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,328
(Abby screams)

1291
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:36,100
- You!
- Abby! Abby! Abby!

1292
01:07:36,202 --> 01:07:37,533
- (Abby screams)
- Abby!

1293
01:07:39,572 --> 01:07:41,540
- (crying and screaming)
- Abby, come here.

1294
01:07:49,749 --> 01:07:52,047
BRAD:
Ah! You scratched me!

1295
01:08:11,937 --> 01:08:13,905
(plays notes)

1296
01:08:26,118 --> 01:08:27,745
NED:
Sorry I- (clears throat)

1297
01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:30,413
I didn't go inside.
It's the smell.

1298
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:33,014
- BRAD: Yeah.
- You know, it brings up...

1299
01:08:33,125 --> 01:08:35,218
unpleasant memories.

1300
01:08:35,327 --> 01:08:37,955
- You got a light?
- Yeah.

1301
01:08:38,063 --> 01:08:39,860
(lighter clicks)

1302
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:42,458
How is she?

1303
01:08:42,568 --> 01:08:44,832
She's pretty heavily medicated.

1304
01:08:44,937 --> 01:08:46,905
- Good.
- (chuckles)

1305
01:08:50,476 --> 01:08:52,239
The doctor said she hasn't
been taking her medication,

1306
01:08:52,344 --> 01:08:55,541
but I... I-I-I made sure every day.

1307
01:08:55,648 --> 01:08:57,673
- I mean, I thought I was on top of that.
- Yeah.

1308
01:08:57,783 --> 01:08:59,580
- You know?
- We Davidoffs are crafty.

1309
01:08:59,685 --> 01:09:03,143
She's probably cheeking the dose.

1310
01:09:03,255 --> 01:09:04,984
Why, why? Why would she do that?

1311
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:07,388
It's the eternal question.

1312
01:09:13,098 --> 01:09:14,656
I've been playing
spot the loony,

1313
01:09:14,767 --> 01:09:16,735
but it's hard to tell.

1314
01:09:19,271 --> 01:09:21,239
She was really...

1315
01:09:25,611 --> 01:09:27,010
Yeah, I'm sorry, man.

1316
01:09:27,112 --> 01:09:30,138
Oh, what are you sorry about?

1317
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:31,773
I feel like I let her down, dude.

1318
01:09:31,884 --> 01:09:34,785
Oh, come on, man.
This runs in the family.

1319
01:09:34,887 --> 01:09:37,947
She'll get better, she will.

1320
01:09:38,057 --> 01:09:39,456
It's-you've got to be optimistic.

1321
01:09:39,558 --> 01:09:42,356
They've made great
strides in psychotropics.

1322
01:09:47,233 --> 01:09:49,201
(groans)

1323
01:09:53,038 --> 01:09:54,972
You sure you want to do this?

1324
01:09:55,074 --> 01:09:58,475
Oh, Chester, I don't
think I have a choice.

1325
01:09:58,577 --> 01:10:00,568
You know, a lot of people
find comfort in work

1326
01:10:00,679 --> 01:10:02,306
when things are tough at home.

1327
01:10:02,414 --> 01:10:04,473
You give up on work,

1328
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:06,380
you might find yourself
with nothing, chief.

1329
01:10:06,485 --> 01:10:08,316
I'm just taking a vacation.

1330
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:10,479
Is that what you're calling it?

1331
01:10:10,589 --> 01:10:12,853
Yeah, two weeks vacation.

1332
01:10:12,958 --> 01:10:14,323
I've got personal days, too.

1333
01:10:14,426 --> 01:10:16,326
This is not the time for a vacation.

1334
01:10:16,428 --> 01:10:17,986
- I'll be checking in.
- Buddy.

1335
01:10:18,097 --> 01:10:19,928
Wait, are you my friend?

1336
01:10:20,032 --> 01:10:21,158
Are we really buddies?

1337
01:10:21,267 --> 01:10:23,258
Because if we are,
then you'll understand.

1338
01:10:23,369 --> 01:10:24,836
If we're not, that's fine.

1339
01:10:24,937 --> 01:10:26,336
But you're gonna have to fire me.

1340
01:10:26,438 --> 01:10:28,065
- Whoa, there.
- Hey, hey.

1341
01:10:28,173 --> 01:10:29,970
I can't- Do you love your kids?

1342
01:10:30,075 --> 01:10:31,975
Yeah, of course.

1343
01:10:32,077 --> 01:10:33,601
I-I have to be home right now.

1344
01:10:33,712 --> 01:10:38,149
Okay? Cover for me or don't.

1345
01:11:00,205 --> 01:11:02,765
Hello?

1346
01:11:02,875 --> 01:11:05,673
Mom? Joshua?

1347
01:11:06,812 --> 01:11:08,780
Anybody here?

1348
01:11:44,516 --> 01:11:46,746
What're you looking at?

1349
01:11:46,852 --> 01:11:49,184
Seth.

1350
01:11:49,288 --> 01:11:50,585
He's the god of chaos.

1351
01:11:50,689 --> 01:11:52,919
Seth?

1352
01:11:53,025 --> 01:11:54,925
That's the name of the god of chaos?

1353
01:11:55,027 --> 01:11:57,495
Pity those heathens.

1354
01:11:59,198 --> 01:12:01,928
Seth cut Osirus into 14 pieces.

1355
01:12:02,034 --> 01:12:03,729
Bad Seth.

1356
01:12:03,836 --> 01:12:06,430
But Seth is also good.

1357
01:12:06,538 --> 01:12:08,506
Without Seth, there is no order

1358
01:12:08,607 --> 01:12:09,801
because Seth is the only one

1359
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:12,001
who can battle
the evil serpent, Apep.

1360
01:12:12,111 --> 01:12:15,012
- Huh.
- Apep is all bad.

1361
01:12:15,114 --> 01:12:16,513
Pure darkness.

1362
01:12:16,615 --> 01:12:18,606
He eats his own screams.

1363
01:12:18,717 --> 01:12:21,277
That's his only nourishment.

1364
01:12:21,387 --> 01:12:23,287
Enough of this myth.

1365
01:12:23,389 --> 01:12:27,120
If Apep swallowed you,
you become nothing.

1366
01:12:27,226 --> 01:12:28,784
A non-being.

1367
01:12:28,894 --> 01:12:31,886
Till the end of existence,
you'd remain in Apep's guts,

1368
01:12:31,997 --> 01:12:34,830
slowly digested for all of eternity.

1369
01:12:34,933 --> 01:12:36,730
And nobody would care
'cause nobody would

1370
01:12:36,835 --> 01:12:38,462
realize you were missing.

1371
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:44,339
And then came Moses
to stop all this nonsense.

1372
01:12:54,686 --> 01:12:57,211
(piano playing)

1373
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:09,263
HAZEL:
Practice carrying...

1374
01:13:09,368 --> 01:13:12,303
You'll grow into it, honey,
we all do.

1375
01:13:18,777 --> 01:13:20,404
(chuckles)

1376
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,414
(footsteps)

1377
01:14:17,469 --> 01:14:20,529
(crying)

1378
01:14:37,923 --> 01:14:39,788
BRAD:
Nothing. She just started crying.

1379
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:41,086
ABBY:
What did you do?

1380
01:14:41,193 --> 01:14:42,592
BRAD:
I didn't do anything.

1381
01:14:52,204 --> 01:14:53,262
Hi.

1382
01:14:53,372 --> 01:14:54,896
How you doing?

1383
01:14:55,007 --> 01:14:56,941
Going to the Brooklyn Museum of Art.

1384
01:14:57,042 --> 01:14:58,907
Let's go, let's go.

1385
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:16,121
You know what, sweetie,

1386
01:15:16,228 --> 01:15:18,890
I really need to use
this little girls' room

1387
01:15:18,997 --> 01:15:21,261
right here for a sec, all right?

1388
01:15:21,366 --> 01:15:24,267
You stay right herewith the, uh...

1389
01:15:45,357 --> 01:15:47,552
Uh...

1390
01:15:52,864 --> 01:15:54,525
(man yelling)

1391
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:57,227
What the fuck...

1392
01:15:57,336 --> 01:15:59,770
(two men yelling)

1393
01:16:26,298 --> 01:16:27,560
HAZEL:
Joshua!

1394
01:16:30,168 --> 01:16:31,795
Joshua!

1395
01:16:42,748 --> 01:16:43,806
Joshua!

1396
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:47,042
(Lily crying)

1397
01:16:48,587 --> 01:16:49,952
What were you doing?!.

1398
01:16:50,055 --> 01:16:51,989
-Where were you?
-Where were you?!.

1399
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:53,921
(Lily crying)

1400
01:16:57,195 --> 01:16:59,857
(crying)

1401
01:16:59,965 --> 01:17:01,330
Brad.

1402
01:17:01,433 --> 01:17:03,424
(mumbles)

1403
01:17:03,535 --> 01:17:05,765
(crying continues)

1404
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:08,499
(crying):
So sorry. My God, Bradley.

1405
01:17:08,607 --> 01:17:09,699
Jesus Christ, Mom.

1406
01:17:09,808 --> 01:17:13,039
(crying):
I'm so sorry.

1407
01:17:13,145 --> 01:17:14,976
Bradley.

1408
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:17,139
I'm sorry.

1409
01:17:17,249 --> 01:17:19,444
I'm so sorry.

1410
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:21,143
(sniffles)

1411
01:17:21,253 --> 01:17:23,221
(mumbles)

1412
01:17:25,557 --> 01:17:26,683
(cries)

1413
01:17:26,792 --> 01:17:28,783
You gave me such a fright.

1414
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:31,556
(crying)

1415
01:17:31,663 --> 01:17:33,597
Shh, shh, shh.

1416
01:17:33,699 --> 01:17:35,860
HAZEL:
Don't! No! No! Oh! You...

1417
01:17:35,967 --> 01:17:37,628
(thudding, woman gasps)

1418
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:47,045
Nana!

1419
01:17:50,982 --> 01:17:53,007
No!

1420
01:17:53,118 --> 01:17:55,052
WOMAN:
Does somebody have a cell phone?

1421
01:17:55,153 --> 01:17:56,313
I don't know...

1422
01:17:56,421 --> 01:17:57,547
(Joshua whimpering)

1423
01:17:57,656 --> 01:18:00,454
(crowd chatter)

1424
01:18:00,625 --> 01:18:02,650
I'm just so sorry about your mother.

1425
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:04,524
I... those stairs.

1426
01:18:04,629 --> 01:18:06,563
They were just
an accident waiting to happen.

1427
01:18:06,665 --> 01:18:10,465
Yeah. I don't know
what happened, you know?

1428
01:18:10,569 --> 01:18:13,970
She was up there

1429
01:18:14,072 --> 01:18:15,562
with Josh...

1430
01:18:18,210 --> 01:18:19,507
Yeah.

1431
01:18:23,882 --> 01:18:26,510
You know, they say she slipped.

1432
01:18:29,087 --> 01:18:30,452
No doubt about it.

1433
01:18:30,555 --> 01:18:33,319
You have had one fucked-up month.

1434
01:18:33,425 --> 01:18:35,757
I think he pushed her.

1435
01:18:35,861 --> 01:18:36,953
Who?

1436
01:18:37,062 --> 01:18:38,791
Joshua.

1437
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:43,665
Come on. That's...

1438
01:18:46,705 --> 01:18:49,071
Come on. You're...

1439
01:18:49,174 --> 01:18:53,008
You're talking
about a nine-year-old boy.

1440
01:18:53,111 --> 01:18:55,204
I think all of this
has been his doing.

1441
01:18:55,313 --> 01:18:57,338
Do you hear me?
I thinkAbby...

1442
01:18:57,449 --> 01:19:00,350
I think the screaming-
Lily's screaming...

1443
01:19:00,452 --> 01:19:02,579
There must be something we can do.

1444
01:19:02,687 --> 01:19:03,949
You don't understand.
I'm trying...

1445
01:19:04,055 --> 01:19:09,459
Maybe you should think
about talking to someone.

1446
01:19:09,561 --> 01:19:11,153
What are you talking about?

1447
01:19:11,263 --> 01:19:13,060
You mean like a shrink or something?

1448
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:14,427
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1449
01:19:14,533 --> 01:19:16,831
I know ifyou...

1450
01:19:16,935 --> 01:19:19,426
This isn't about me.
I'm talking about...

1451
01:19:19,538 --> 01:19:21,938
Ah! Joshua, my boy.

1452
01:19:26,077 --> 01:19:30,036
(whispering)

1453
01:19:50,402 --> 01:19:52,563
Lily's sleeping with me from now on.

1454
01:19:52,671 --> 01:19:55,231
Daddy?

1455
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:56,864
Yes?

1456
01:19:56,975 --> 01:19:58,840
I'm scared.

1457
01:19:58,944 --> 01:20:01,640
Yeah? Well...

1458
01:20:03,248 --> 01:20:05,648
Daddy?

1459
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:07,513
Yeah?

1460
01:20:07,619 --> 01:20:09,109
I don't understand.

1461
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:10,518
Go to bed.

1462
01:20:15,026 --> 01:20:18,484
(footsteps)

1463
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:27,098
(footsteps)

1464
01:20:44,689 --> 01:20:47,214
Daddy?

1465
01:20:47,325 --> 01:20:49,088
Do you like my house?

1466
01:20:49,194 --> 01:20:51,059
I made it last night.

1467
01:21:03,909 --> 01:21:06,275
I know what you're doing,Josh.

1468
01:21:06,378 --> 01:21:08,869
I don't know why you're
doing it, but I'm on to you.

1469
01:21:11,016 --> 01:21:13,883
They're just blocks, Daddy.

1470
01:21:13,985 --> 01:21:18,319
You're not going
to hurt anybody else.

1471
01:21:20,058 --> 01:21:21,525
Are you mad at me?

1472
01:21:21,626 --> 01:21:25,756
Do you still love me, Daddy?

1473
01:21:29,701 --> 01:21:31,862
I think you're sick,Josh.

1474
01:21:38,343 --> 01:21:40,607
I don't feel sick.

1475
01:21:40,712 --> 01:21:42,475
Not at all.

1476
01:21:46,618 --> 01:21:50,145
Why are you doing this?

1477
01:21:50,255 --> 01:21:52,883
Huh?

1478
01:21:58,129 --> 01:22:00,927
You know what
the best part is, Daddy?

1479
01:22:13,278 --> 01:22:16,270
(Lily crying)

1480
01:22:19,851 --> 01:22:22,786
(crying continues)

1481
01:22:25,857 --> 01:22:29,054
(crying continues)

1482
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:35,664
(crying continues)

1483
01:22:38,403 --> 01:22:42,100
(crying continues)

1484
01:22:44,275 --> 01:22:47,142
(crying continues)

1485
01:23:16,041 --> 01:23:19,306
(ice in glass rattling)

1486
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:38,020
(ice rattling)

1487
01:23:39,831 --> 01:23:43,597
(ice rattling)

1488
01:23:43,702 --> 01:23:45,761
(doorbell rings)

1489
01:24:05,356 --> 01:24:06,789
Hi. How are you?

1490
01:24:06,891 --> 01:24:08,415
Good to see you.

1491
01:24:08,526 --> 01:24:09,993
Really good to see you.

1492
01:24:10,095 --> 01:24:11,995
(conversation continues
indistinctly)

1493
01:24:29,681 --> 01:24:34,618
Hey, buddy, this is Dr. Polsheck.

1494
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:36,380
She's here to talk to you.

1495
01:24:36,488 --> 01:24:37,819
Oh, no. Betsy, please.

1496
01:24:37,922 --> 01:24:40,686
Hello,Joshua.

1497
01:24:40,792 --> 01:24:43,920
Betsy's a child psychologist.

1498
01:24:44,028 --> 01:24:45,962
She's going to talk to you.

1499
01:24:46,064 --> 01:24:48,999
Yeah. Maybe you could
show me your room. I hear

1500
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:51,660
you have a guinea pig.
I love guinea pigs.

1501
01:24:51,770 --> 01:24:54,364
My guinea pig?

1502
01:24:54,472 --> 01:24:57,964
Okay.

1503
01:24:58,076 --> 01:24:59,907
Great.

1504
01:25:00,011 --> 01:25:02,536
Have fun, buddy.

1505
01:25:02,647 --> 01:25:04,342
Do you like to draw?

1506
01:25:04,449 --> 01:25:05,973
Oh, I love drawing.

1507
01:25:29,474 --> 01:25:33,342
Keep drawing.
That's good.

1508
01:25:43,988 --> 01:25:45,455
That's really something.

1509
01:25:53,832 --> 01:25:57,791
Joshua, come here for a second.

1510
01:25:57,902 --> 01:25:59,767
Why don't you do me a favor,

1511
01:25:59,871 --> 01:26:02,271
and go in your bedroom? All right?

1512
01:26:02,373 --> 01:26:03,806
Just for a second?

1513
01:26:08,513 --> 01:26:11,676
Listen, I should be alone
with the boy, okay?

1514
01:26:11,783 --> 01:26:14,013
Yeah. Sure.

1515
01:26:14,118 --> 01:26:16,609
Do you see...? This...

1516
01:26:16,721 --> 01:26:18,746
this is off.
Something is wrong here.

1517
01:26:18,857 --> 01:26:20,688
This has got to be the sign
of some kind of...

1518
01:26:20,792 --> 01:26:22,623
- You got that right.
- Sociopath?

1519
01:26:22,727 --> 01:26:24,957
No, no, no, Mr. Cairn.

1520
01:26:25,063 --> 01:26:26,325
That's...
that's not it.

1521
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:28,729
What is this?

1522
01:26:28,833 --> 01:26:32,530
This picture is
a textbook example of abuse.

1523
01:26:32,637 --> 01:26:35,071
Okay? That boy is being abused...

1524
01:26:35,173 --> 01:26:36,606
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1525
01:26:36,708 --> 01:26:38,505
to such a degree that I can't...

1526
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:39,872
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1527
01:26:39,978 --> 01:26:41,741
Let me tell you what
you're dealing with here.

1528
01:26:41,846 --> 01:26:42,778
- I don't care...
- He probably...

1529
01:26:42,881 --> 01:26:44,143
He probably researched it.

1530
01:26:44,249 --> 01:26:45,773
He probably looked it up
on the computer.

1531
01:26:45,884 --> 01:26:47,249
He probably knew exactly
what to draw.

1532
01:26:47,352 --> 01:26:49,479
This is abuse
I'm talking about right here.

1533
01:26:49,587 --> 01:26:51,054
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1534
01:26:51,155 --> 01:26:53,919
What areyou...?
Nobody's beating him.

1535
01:26:54,025 --> 01:26:55,253
I'm not... He probably...

1536
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:56,588
Why are you being so defensive?

1537
01:26:56,694 --> 01:26:58,423
- I'm not being...
- I'm just pointing out the fact

1538
01:26:58,529 --> 01:27:00,827
- that your son has been abused.
- Listen, you have to...

1539
01:27:00,932 --> 01:27:03,127
Back off!. Okay?

1540
01:27:19,284 --> 01:27:21,309
Talked to your headmaster.

1541
01:27:21,419 --> 01:27:22,579
- You did?
- Yeah.

1542
01:27:22,687 --> 01:27:24,587
We agreed you're not
being challenged enough,

1543
01:27:24,689 --> 01:27:28,125
so we're going to send you
somewhere else far away.

1544
01:27:28,226 --> 01:27:29,989
You're going to learn how to ski.

1545
01:27:30,094 --> 01:27:32,858
It's going to be great.

1546
01:27:32,964 --> 01:27:33,896
But how could...?

1547
01:27:33,998 --> 01:27:35,363
End of discussion, little man.

1548
01:27:35,466 --> 01:27:37,491
No buts, okay?

1549
01:27:37,602 --> 01:27:38,864
You're going away.

1550
01:27:38,970 --> 01:27:40,335
You understand?

1551
01:27:40,438 --> 01:27:41,735
Hey.

1552
01:27:41,839 --> 01:27:43,204
Josh...Joshua!

1553
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:48,679
What?

1554
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:50,645
What are you looking at?

1555
01:28:04,963 --> 01:28:06,794
Josh?

1556
01:28:08,633 --> 01:28:11,602
Josh, I want you to come here
right now, you hear me?

1557
01:28:14,138 --> 01:28:15,935
Josh.

1558
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,099
Hey, boy.

1559
01:28:21,412 --> 01:28:24,142
It's me. I want to talk to you.

1560
01:28:24,248 --> 01:28:26,307
We're going to talk about this.

1561
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:31,181
Josh?

1562
01:28:33,124 --> 01:28:34,853
Joshua?

1563
01:28:35,827 --> 01:28:37,761
Josh!

1564
01:28:37,862 --> 01:28:40,387
Everything's okay, buddy.
Come on out.

1565
01:28:40,498 --> 01:28:41,988
I know you're here.

1566
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:45,160
Listen, nothing's
set in stone, okay?

1567
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:48,035
(to himself):
All right, suit yourself.

1568
01:28:49,607 --> 01:28:50,972
Josh?

1569
01:28:51,075 --> 01:28:52,736
Josh!

1570
01:29:28,813 --> 01:29:31,304
(distant whining)

1571
01:29:35,987 --> 01:29:39,320
(whining grows louder)

1572
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:45,320
(whining continues)

1573
01:29:48,699 --> 01:29:50,189
(Lily coos)

1574
01:30:08,419 --> 01:30:11,252
(whimpering)

1575
01:30:16,227 --> 01:30:17,558
(crying)

1576
01:30:28,873 --> 01:30:30,568
(crying continues)

1577
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:37,106
(crying grows louder)

1578
01:30:37,215 --> 01:30:39,240
(whispers):
Joshua.

1579
01:30:40,318 --> 01:30:42,047
Joshua.
What are you doing?

1580
01:30:42,153 --> 01:30:43,347
Come out from under there.

1581
01:30:43,454 --> 01:30:44,819
I don't want to go.

1582
01:30:44,922 --> 01:30:45,911
Joshua, come on.

1583
01:30:46,023 --> 01:30:47,047
Come out from under there.

1584
01:30:47,158 --> 01:30:48,216
(sniffles)

1585
01:30:48,326 --> 01:30:50,419
- I want to stay here
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1586
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:53,122
- with you and Lily...
- Shh, shh, shh.

1587
01:30:53,231 --> 01:30:56,428
- and Mom when she gets better.
- Shh, shh.

1588
01:30:56,534 --> 01:30:57,660
- Come here.
- I want to stay.

1589
01:30:57,768 --> 01:30:59,065
- Come on.
- Ow!

1590
01:30:59,170 --> 01:31:00,899
Ow!

1591
01:31:01,906 --> 01:31:03,396
- Come here.
- (groans)

1592
01:31:03,508 --> 01:31:05,408
What's going on?

1593
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:06,977
Ah, oh.

1594
01:31:07,078 --> 01:31:09,444
My God,Joshua,
what happened to you?

1595
01:31:09,547 --> 01:31:11,071
- What happened?
- I slipped.

1596
01:31:11,182 --> 01:31:12,149
You what?

1597
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:14,013
I slipped.

1598
01:31:14,118 --> 01:31:16,143
- I-I...
-Joshua, please tell me what happened.

1599
01:31:16,254 --> 01:31:17,881
- I slipped, really.
- Who did this to you?

1600
01:31:17,989 --> 01:31:19,718
- I slipped, really.
- Who did this to you?!.

1601
01:31:19,824 --> 01:31:22,759
- I slipped.
- You tell me who did it to you.

1602
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:26,887
Look, it's just there, okay?
That's all.

1603
01:31:26,998 --> 01:31:29,296
It doesn't hurt much.

1604
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:32,335
Okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry.

1605
01:31:32,436 --> 01:31:34,563
(cries)

1606
01:31:34,672 --> 01:31:36,936
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, okay?

1607
01:31:52,957 --> 01:31:54,652
- Stay, stay with me.
- Shh, shh, shh.

1608
01:31:54,759 --> 01:31:56,659
- Stay.
-Josh.

1609
01:31:56,761 --> 01:31:58,353
- I got to go check...
- Stay.

1610
01:31:58,462 --> 01:31:59,793
I got to check on Lily.

1611
01:31:59,897 --> 01:32:01,797
- Stay with me.
- I got to go.

1612
01:32:01,899 --> 01:32:03,298
Stay like you used to.

1613
01:32:03,401 --> 01:32:04,959
You're gonna...

1614
01:32:05,069 --> 01:32:07,936
Stay with me like you used to.

1615
01:32:11,475 --> 01:32:14,239
Okay, okay, okay, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1616
01:32:14,345 --> 01:32:16,336
Just go to sleep.
Just go to sleep.

1617
01:32:19,984 --> 01:32:21,815
Just go to sleep, buddy.

1618
01:32:24,422 --> 01:32:26,754
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1619
01:32:52,049 --> 01:32:53,414
(gasps)

1620
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:58,247
Josh? Josh.

1621
01:33:05,529 --> 01:33:08,498
Shh. She's almost done.

1622
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:12,869
You were hungry this
morning, weren't you?

1623
01:33:16,407 --> 01:33:18,102
It's a beautiful day.

1624
01:33:18,209 --> 01:33:21,804
After this, how about
we go outside and play?

1625
01:33:31,555 --> 01:33:34,718
(children shouting playfully
in distance)

1626
01:33:48,172 --> 01:33:49,730
Joshua...

1627
01:33:52,209 --> 01:33:54,871
Beware of the Jabberwock.

1628
01:33:54,979 --> 01:33:57,709
What?

1629
01:33:57,815 --> 01:34:00,511
(cries)

1630
01:34:00,618 --> 01:34:02,483
Shh...

1631
01:34:02,586 --> 01:34:04,884
shh, shh, shh, shh.

1632
01:34:04,989 --> 01:34:07,958
(crying continues)

1633
01:34:10,027 --> 01:34:11,551
Did he just...

1634
01:34:11,662 --> 01:34:13,857
just take your fuckin' binky?!.

1635
01:34:13,964 --> 01:34:16,797
(crying continues)

1636
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:18,129
Joshua.

1637
01:34:18,235 --> 01:34:19,532
Joshua.

1638
01:34:19,637 --> 01:34:21,366
Joshua!

1639
01:34:21,472 --> 01:34:23,133
Where's Lily's binky?

1640
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:24,935
- (Lily crying)
-Joshua!

1641
01:34:25,042 --> 01:34:26,703
(crying continues)

1642
01:34:26,811 --> 01:34:29,075
Joshua, come down.

1643
01:34:31,482 --> 01:34:32,710
Josh.

1644
01:34:32,817 --> 01:34:33,806
Josh.

1645
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:37,615
(Lily crying)

1646
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:41,452
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1647
01:34:41,559 --> 01:34:43,083
It's okay, it's okay.

1648
01:34:43,194 --> 01:34:44,855
(crying continues)

1649
01:34:44,962 --> 01:34:45,951
Come on.

1650
01:34:46,063 --> 01:34:46,995
Let's go.

1651
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:48,395
Come on, let's go.

1652
01:34:48,499 --> 01:34:50,797
I'm talking to you.
You better come down here right now.

1653
01:34:50,901 --> 01:34:52,801
- You better come down here right now.
-Joshua.

1654
01:34:52,903 --> 01:34:55,133
(Lily crying)

1655
01:34:55,239 --> 01:34:57,104
-Joshua.
-Joshua.

1656
01:35:00,478 --> 01:35:02,343
-Joshua...
-Joshua.

1657
01:35:02,446 --> 01:35:04,209
I'm not fucking around
with you right now,

1658
01:35:04,315 --> 01:35:05,282
you understand me?

1659
01:35:09,587 --> 01:35:10,485
Come down right now.

1660
01:35:10,588 --> 01:35:11,680
Come down right now.

1661
01:35:11,789 --> 01:35:13,222
Goddamn it!

1662
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:16,183
- WOMAN: Bobby, get down from...
- Where is it?

1663
01:35:16,293 --> 01:35:17,555
- Where is it?
- Where is it?

1664
01:35:17,661 --> 01:35:18,992
- Where is it?
- Where is it?

1665
01:35:19,096 --> 01:35:20,063
Where's Lily's binky?

1666
01:35:20,164 --> 01:35:21,096
Where's Lily's binky?

1667
01:35:21,198 --> 01:35:22,324
- Where is it?
- Where is it?

1668
01:35:22,433 --> 01:35:23,525
You answer me.

1669
01:35:23,634 --> 01:35:25,158
- You answer your father.
- You answer your father.

1670
01:35:25,269 --> 01:35:26,258
Answer your father!

1671
01:35:26,370 --> 01:35:27,564
No, no, no, Daddy!

1672
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:30,467
(woman gasps in distance)

1673
01:35:30,574 --> 01:35:33,475
(onlookers murmuring)

1674
01:35:33,577 --> 01:35:35,272
Josh.

1675
01:35:35,379 --> 01:35:37,677
I'm sorry.

1676
01:35:42,853 --> 01:35:45,583
Nobody will ever love you.

1677
01:35:53,397 --> 01:35:55,865
(stifled moans)

1678
01:36:00,938 --> 01:36:02,838
(ominous music plays)

1679
01:36:41,946 --> 01:36:42,913
(door opens)

1680
01:36:43,981 --> 01:36:47,439
Oh, Chester, thank God.

1681
01:36:47,551 --> 01:36:48,984
- Hey, buddy.
- Sit down, sit down.

1682
01:36:49,086 --> 01:36:50,018
What's going on here?

1683
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:51,644
When am I getting bail?

1684
01:36:51,755 --> 01:36:53,188
Not till Monday.

1685
01:36:53,290 --> 01:36:54,450
Don't you know?

1686
01:36:54,558 --> 01:36:56,617
Never beat up your kid
in public on the weekend.

1687
01:36:56,727 --> 01:36:58,194
Chester, um, I-I appreciate
you coming.

1688
01:36:58,295 --> 01:36:59,660
- All right.
- I've had a long...

1689
01:36:59,763 --> 01:37:02,630
Whatever!
Whatever! I'm here!

1690
01:37:02,733 --> 01:37:04,860
You see the judge tomorrow.

1691
01:37:07,538 --> 01:37:10,507
I've been doing
a little snooping via a friend.

1692
01:37:10,608 --> 01:37:11,768
This is bad.

1693
01:37:11,876 --> 01:37:12,774
This is really bad.

1694
01:37:12,877 --> 01:37:14,003
Yeah, I know it's bad, okay?

1695
01:37:14,111 --> 01:37:15,203
It isn't the whole story, Chester.

1696
01:37:15,312 --> 01:37:16,210
We'll, let's see.

1697
01:37:16,313 --> 01:37:17,940
- It's not...
- Let's see.

1698
01:37:18,048 --> 01:37:20,016
Uh, over 30 eyewitnesses,

1699
01:37:20,117 --> 01:37:22,210
your boy tells the cops
he's been being abused

1700
01:37:22,319 --> 01:37:24,014
since his sister was born,

1701
01:37:24,121 --> 01:37:25,645
bruises all over his body,

1702
01:37:25,756 --> 01:37:27,656
a sheaf of Joshua's
drawings

1703
01:37:27,758 --> 01:37:29,123
that have the
authorities drooling...

1704
01:37:29,226 --> 01:37:33,356
Chester, goddamn it,
it isn't the whole story, okay?

1705
01:37:33,464 --> 01:37:34,692
- Look...
- I'm trying to tell...

1706
01:37:34,798 --> 01:37:36,459
I have to get out of here now.

1707
01:37:36,567 --> 01:37:41,470
They say you were tampering
with Abby's medication.

1708
01:37:41,572 --> 01:37:45,941
What? That's-that's insane.

1709
01:37:46,043 --> 01:37:49,012
(piano playing gentle melody)

1710
01:37:54,151 --> 01:37:56,016
No, look,
I don't care

1711
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:57,314
if she's from
the Philippines

1712
01:37:57,421 --> 01:37:58,752
or Philadelphia,
I just need

1713
01:37:58,856 --> 01:38:02,553
someone who knows how
to take care of a baby.

1714
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:04,719
Listen, if it looks like
it's for a kid,

1715
01:38:04,828 --> 01:38:06,728
pick it up and pack it,
okay? Thanks.

1716
01:38:06,830 --> 01:38:08,593
(playing "Twinkle, Twinkle,
Little Star")

1717
01:38:08,699 --> 01:38:11,668
Oh, for the love of God,
please, today.

1718
01:38:11,769 --> 01:38:14,863
Yes, yes.

1719
01:38:14,972 --> 01:38:16,564
Imelda sounds great.

1720
01:38:16,674 --> 01:38:17,868
Yes.

1721
01:38:17,975 --> 01:38:22,412
Great, send her over.
Thank you. Thank you, very much.

1722
01:38:22,513 --> 01:38:23,878
Bye.

1723
01:38:23,981 --> 01:38:26,176
(sighs)

1724
01:38:26,283 --> 01:38:28,183
Hey...

1725
01:38:28,285 --> 01:38:29,650
Imelda...

1726
01:38:29,753 --> 01:38:33,245
sounds like she is one
fabulous cook,

1727
01:38:33,357 --> 01:38:37,794
which makes you one
very, very lucky girl.

1728
01:38:37,895 --> 01:38:40,921
Want to suck on your hand instead?

1729
01:38:41,031 --> 01:38:45,798
Oh! Your sister's just about the
cutest thing in the whole world.

1730
01:38:46,971 --> 01:38:49,439
I love her more than anything.

1731
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:59,811
You know, siblings
are very important

1732
01:38:59,917 --> 01:39:02,852
in strange times.

1733
01:39:02,953 --> 01:39:05,615
Speaking from experience.

1734
01:39:05,723 --> 01:39:07,884
Like you and Mom?

1735
01:39:07,992 --> 01:39:10,688
Yeah.

1736
01:39:10,794 --> 01:39:11,692
(plays pretty melody)

1737
01:39:11,795 --> 01:39:13,387
- Ned?
- Mm-hmm?

1738
01:39:13,497 --> 01:39:16,261
I'm glad you're here.

1739
01:39:16,367 --> 01:39:18,164
I mean...

1740
01:39:18,268 --> 01:39:21,237
you, me, th...

1741
01:39:21,338 --> 01:39:23,704
this feels right, doesn't it?

1742
01:39:23,807 --> 01:39:25,672
The way it always should have been.

1743
01:39:25,776 --> 01:39:28,074
(notes trailing off)

1744
01:39:30,114 --> 01:39:33,572
We should compose
something together.

1745
01:39:33,684 --> 01:39:35,151
(clears throat)

1746
01:39:35,252 --> 01:39:36,742
(smacks lips)

1747
01:39:36,854 --> 01:39:40,984
(plays plaintive chords)

1748
01:39:41,091 --> 01:39:47,189
# Nobody ever
called me "Daddy" #

1749
01:39:47,297 --> 01:39:50,061
(a capella):
# Actually, that's not true. #

1750
01:39:50,167 --> 01:39:52,226
Ugh!

1751
01:39:52,403 --> 01:39:55,668
(playing soft arpeggios)

1752
01:40:01,578 --> 01:40:04,877
(plays sparse melody)

1753
01:40:04,982 --> 01:40:08,577
# You know they
didn't ever #

1754
01:40:08,686 --> 01:40:13,089
# Have to love me #

1755
01:40:13,190 --> 01:40:17,320
# No, no, no #

1756
01:40:17,428 --> 01:40:23,389
# And no one will ever
love them now #

1757
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:32,575
# But they always
wanted somehow #

1758
01:40:32,676 --> 01:40:35,907
- # To save me #
- (footsteps approaching)

1759
01:40:36,013 --> 01:40:39,813
# Why, oh, why? #

1760
01:40:39,917 --> 01:40:41,646
# For pity's sake #

1761
01:40:41,752 --> 01:40:46,121
# They should have
saved themselves #

1762
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:57,589
# But you, you always said
I never missed a note #

1763
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:09,404
# And nobody ever knew me
like you do #

1764
01:41:15,085 --> 01:41:20,921
# You always said
it was gonna be okay #

1765
01:41:26,630 --> 01:41:32,796
# I only ever really
wanted to be with you. #

1766
01:41:32,903 --> 01:41:34,598
(stops playing)

1767
01:41:49,686 --> 01:41:51,711
(acoustic guitar strums
folk-rock rhythm)

1768
01:41:51,822 --> 01:41:54,290
(man singing)

1769
01:45:41,118 --> 01:45:43,086
(music fades)
