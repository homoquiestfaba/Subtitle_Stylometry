1
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:59,527
<i>Hey, honey. It's your mom.</i>

2
00:00:59,661 --> 00:01:01,261
<i>I just wanted to call again.</i>

3
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:03,130
<i>I was hoping maybe you'd</i>
<i>answer.</i>

4
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:06,634
<i>We just haven't heard from you</i>
<i>in, like, six days.</i>

5
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:10,370
<i>We're all really,</i>
<i>really nervous.</i>

6
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:12,740
<i>Your friends don't know</i>
<i>where you are.</i>

7
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:16,678
<i>That new boy you're dating,</i>
<i>then you broke up two weeks</i>
<i>ago?</i>

8
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,949
<i>If anything happened to you,</i>
<i>I'd just die.</i>

9
00:01:21,716 --> 00:01:24,652
<i>I love you so much.</i>

10
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,086
<i>Please just call.</i>

11
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:28,690
<i>Love you.</i>

12
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:43,791
- This is Hera.
<i>- Hera, it's me.</i>

13
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,927
<i>Can you please</i>
<i>watch Corey tonight?</i>

14
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,695
I'm-- I'm at work.

15
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:49,030
<i>Can't talk to</i>
<i>your sister at work?</i>

16
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:53,467
<i>Can you please help?</i>
<i>She'll just be coloring.</i>

17
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,570
No, I have to work.

18
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,740
<i>Tonight?</i>
<i>Like, just from 8:00 to 9:00?</i>

19
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:01,341
Look, I have to go.

20
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:04,311
<i>Fine. See you Monday. Love you.</i>

21
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:11,384
Was that your sister?

22
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:13,353
Yeah.

23
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,590
Is she single?

24
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:18,159
Uh, yeah. She is, actually.

25
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:20,995
- Are you single?
- Uh...

26
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,631
kind of.

27
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:26,266
I have siblings too.

28
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,007
How many siblings do you have?

29
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:38,846
Two from my dad
and two from my stepmom.

30
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,016
That's awesome.

31
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:58,431
Oh. Did you guys have
the conference room booked?

32
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:01,169
No. It's fine, we're eating too.

33
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,237
Oh. Cool.

34
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:05,372
Have you ever been to Italy?

35
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:08,676
-No.
-Oh, my God!

36
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:11,179
You should totally go.
It's amazing.

37
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,948
-I would love to.
-My family and I go every year.

38
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:16,851
We go to Florence,
and then we go to Positano.

39
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,452
Oh, is that the place where they
have all the houses built into

40
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,189
-the side of the hill?
-Yes! And they have these

41
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,390
really special lemons.

42
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,895
Hera, have you been anywhere?

43
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:30,665
Oh, I don't travel much.

44
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:32,300
Neither do I.

45
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,102
The kids are too young,
and Mike would never let me

46
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:36,737
leave him alone with them.

47
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:41,441
Hera,
what are you doing tonight?

48
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:43,945
- I'm going on a date.
- With who?

49
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:46,147
A friend.

50
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:49,382
- Named... Zach?
- Really?

51
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,687
Well, if you don't say anything,
it never really happened, right?

52
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:56,691
So, have you guys
fucked in the office yet?

53
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:03,496
We got a big one, team!

54
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:07,168
$10 million account.

55
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:09,337
-Let's go!
-Yeah!

56
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,371
Sounds like
you owe us some champagne!

57
00:06:28,356 --> 00:06:31,792
So, I had an incredible night.

58
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,493
Me too.

59
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:35,162
Can I come in?

60
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:37,331
No!

61
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,367
What's wrong? I...

62
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,003
You like the gift, right?

63
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:43,470
I can buy my own plants.

64
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,873
Not if you're only making $100K.

65
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,009
What makes you think
I make $100K?

66
00:06:48,376 --> 00:06:50,443
Well, that's what I made
right out of college.

67
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,017
-I make way less than that.
-Hera, I'm not trying to brag.

68
00:06:57,051 --> 00:07:00,221
Just saying, you can
come to me if you need help.

69
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:02,089
With your tests, your accounts.

70
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:06,493
And you are...

71
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:08,461
so pretty.

72
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:11,899
It sucks.

73
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:14,368
There's a glass ceiling.

74
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:17,705
Without help, it'll crush you.

75
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:22,442
-I should probably get to bed.
-Hera.

76
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:25,713
Come on, just invite me inside.

77
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,349
I just moved,
so I have a lot of boxes.

78
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,650
But you-- you could come

79
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:31,085
-another time, maybe--
-Hera. Hey.

80
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,921
-Hera.
-Zach.

81
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,455
-Hera.
-Zach.

82
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,224
-Hera.
-Zach...

83
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:44,865
If-- if you didn't
want this to happen,

84
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:46,934
why'd you let me
ask you out again?

85
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,670
I mean, I live, like,
40 fucking minutes away.

86
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:53,741
So I was-- I was
taking your lead on things.

87
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,843
I thought you liked me.

88
00:07:55,977 --> 00:07:56,844
I do.

89
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:59,747
I just-- I don't wanna be
another win to you.

90
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:03,050
Well, you're making me look
like a fuckin' loser out here.

91
00:08:06,387 --> 00:08:07,888
Can we talk about this later?

92
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,560
You could have everything.

93
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:19,400
Come on.

94
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:21,869
-Let's have some fun.
-No.

95
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:24,538
-Let's just have some fun.
-Please stop.

96
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,175
-Ooh, I like when you beg.
-No...

97
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,745
No, please, stop. Please, stop.

98
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:35,816
Just invite me inside.

99
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,686
Just invite me inside.

100
00:08:40,054 --> 00:08:41,122
No.

101
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:42,590
I don't want to.

102
00:08:43,224 --> 00:08:45,192
Do you want me
to turn the handle for you?

103
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:49,563
Okay.

104
00:08:50,231 --> 00:08:51,298
Okay.

105
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:54,368
It's that easy. Come on.

106
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:28,069
Zach?

107
00:09:31,272 --> 00:09:32,339
Zach?

108
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,894
<i>You've reached</i>
<i>Zachary Osman,</i>

109
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:01,695
<i>financial team lead</i>
<i>at Paver Financial.</i>

110
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:03,931
<i>Please leave me a message,</i>
<i>and I or someone from the team</i>

111
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:05,499
<i>will reach out. Thanks.</i>

112
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,734
Hey.

113
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:10,804
Um, sorry I'm calling your work.

114
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:14,742
I-- I don't have
your personal cell.

115
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,411
Um, I just wanted to--

116
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:21,248
to call and say hi
and talk about last night.

117
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:23,350
Um...

118
00:11:24,318 --> 00:11:27,388
you left your jacket here,
and, um...

119
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:29,857
and I really like
the flower you got me.

120
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:35,296
Just call me back
when you get this.

121
00:11:36,397 --> 00:11:38,065
Okay.

122
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:39,266
Bye.

123
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:41,468
Bye.

124
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,803
Can't sleep?

125
00:14:12,587 --> 00:14:15,189
- Hey.
<i>- Hey. Sorry, it's late.</i>

126
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:16,558
<i>I'm sure you're asleep.</i>

127
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,093
<i>You want me to come</i>
<i>and get my jacket right now?</i>

128
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:22,162
Did you listen to my voicemail?

129
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,264
<i>How about I come over</i>

130
00:14:24,398 --> 00:14:27,167
<i>and you answer the door</i>
<i>wearing just my jacket?</i>

131
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,043
I don't have it.

132
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,512
<i>Is something wrong with you?</i>

133
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:40,080
<i>Jesus.</i>
<i>You know what, never mind.</i>

134
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:42,449
Zach?

135
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:44,485
Zach?

136
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:28,630
What do we think?

137
00:15:30,765 --> 00:15:32,065
For work.

138
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:34,435
For Zach.

139
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,231
- Any plans this week?
- Oh, yeah.

140
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:06,433
- What?
- Work.

141
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:08,570
My man. My man.

142
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:11,138
-Hi.
-Hey.

143
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:15,108
You, uh, have something else
on your desk. Got it for you.

144
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:20,515
Hey, good work on
those access to capital reviews.

145
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:23,283
- You saw my report?
- Mm-hmm.

146
00:16:23,618 --> 00:16:24,686
Thank you.

147
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:49,744
Coming in late on a Monday?

148
00:16:50,912 --> 00:16:52,747
Uh, it's before 9:00 a.m.

149
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:56,316
Junior analysts tend to be
in before their team lead, so.

150
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:59,052
Okay.
I'll be here earlier tomorrow.

151
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:01,656
You're very smart,
and you do good work.

152
00:17:01,823 --> 00:17:02,857
Thank you.

153
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:07,027
You just have some of
the non-tangibles to figure out.

154
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,063
School can't
teach you everything.

155
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:13,500
I just-- I wanna let you know
that this is my dream job.

156
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,971
This is not a college,
and I'm not a professor.

157
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:18,372
Okay?

158
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:24,211
Trying to match your new plant?

159
00:17:25,547 --> 00:17:27,715
Yeah. I don't know.

160
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:29,751
Okay, well.
You don't see clients,

161
00:17:29,884 --> 00:17:32,654
so you don't need to do...
all this.

162
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:35,322
Okay.

163
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:39,393
Uh, break down these financials
before end of day.

164
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:42,664
Uh, if you see any red flags,
make sure to note it.

165
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,064
Okay.

166
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,668
Okay.

167
00:17:49,871 --> 00:17:51,204
Hey, Lori?

168
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:04,384
-Hey.
-What's up?

169
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,353
What did Borey-Lori want?

170
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:08,756
She said I shouldn't
dress like this.

171
00:18:08,923 --> 00:18:09,991
What, hot?

172
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,859
You're stupid.

173
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:14,227
You dress like that for me?

174
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:17,197
Matched the flower you got me.

175
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:19,801
Oh.

176
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:21,536
Yeah, I get it.

177
00:18:25,873 --> 00:18:27,809
Uh...

178
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:29,242
what's with the, um...

179
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:31,646
I took the condom off.

180
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:34,414
What?

181
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:37,685
Wait, did you--

182
00:18:38,086 --> 00:18:39,654
-Inside?
-How did you not--

183
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:42,624
Wait, seriously?

184
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:48,096
Uh, do you wanna
get lunch today?

185
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:49,897
-Like, just me and you?
-You...

186
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,899
have to take the pill.

187
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,435
Can we talk during lunch?

188
00:18:57,805 --> 00:19:00,108
I was thinking...

189
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,175
you could suck my dick at lunch?

190
00:19:06,581 --> 00:19:08,248
What the fuck is wrong with you?

191
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:12,285
I just wanna
talk about Saturday.

192
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:16,189
Sir.

193
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:18,760
I-- I can't.
I'm actually with a client--

194
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:21,328
That is
the VP of Acquisitions.

195
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:24,666
Unprofessional bullshit.
I thought we liked each other.

196
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,933
I do.

197
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:31,706
This is what I fucking hate.
This is fucking bullshit.

198
00:21:29,924 --> 00:21:30,992
Hera?

199
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:34,829
Hera, is that you?

200
00:21:37,231 --> 00:21:38,498
Hera?

201
00:21:40,234 --> 00:21:41,502
Hera?

202
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:47,508
Why didn't you say anything?

203
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:53,147
Weirdo. Um, hey, uh,
so, got anything good?

204
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:56,784
I, um... ...I just
finished the last of mine.

205
00:21:56,918 --> 00:22:00,021
I stayed up late as fuck
last night, so...

206
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,524
Oh, you're crying.

207
00:22:04,058 --> 00:22:05,827
Um...

208
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:09,496
I was taking allergy medicine.

209
00:22:15,036 --> 00:22:17,839
Uh, anyways, so, you really
shouldn't cry at work.

210
00:22:18,606 --> 00:22:20,975
About work, or...

211
00:22:21,108 --> 00:22:23,410
boys, or whatever.

212
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:25,913
They'll eat you alive.

213
00:22:26,647 --> 00:22:27,949
Any one of them.

214
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,384
We're all carnivores here.

215
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:42,797
Bye.

216
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:09,223
Vicky?

217
00:23:09,357 --> 00:23:10,925
Vicky, I don't like this.

218
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:25,800
90 days.

219
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:28,035
You nervous?

220
00:24:29,103 --> 00:24:31,973
No. I was just
thinking about something.

221
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,708
An account?

222
00:24:34,408 --> 00:24:35,776
Yeah.

223
00:24:36,777 --> 00:24:38,446
You're nervous. It's okay.

224
00:24:38,612 --> 00:24:41,015
I'm the big dog, and I'm scary.

225
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:42,216
Except I'm not.

226
00:24:42,383 --> 00:24:44,652
-I hope I didn't offend you.
-Offend me?

227
00:24:44,785 --> 00:24:48,488
I have some pretty thick skin.

228
00:24:49,724 --> 00:24:51,058
You don't have to
be afraid of me.

229
00:24:51,392 --> 00:24:54,862
If you make money, I win.
Your success is my success.

230
00:24:54,996 --> 00:24:57,431
So, I just want us to be
on the same page, right?

231
00:24:57,598 --> 00:24:58,666
Right.

232
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:00,534
So, tell me, what's going on?

233
00:25:02,403 --> 00:25:03,671
With me?

234
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:09,176
I'm good. Yeah.

235
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,778
You think?

236
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:13,881
Yeah. I think I'm good.

237
00:25:17,385 --> 00:25:18,786
Crushing it.

238
00:25:19,887 --> 00:25:21,622
-Really?
-Absolutely.

239
00:25:21,756 --> 00:25:24,191
-So this is your first job ever?
-Yeah.

240
00:25:24,592 --> 00:25:29,263
I mean, I worked at a coffee
shop during college, but...

241
00:25:29,397 --> 00:25:31,699
I'd love for you
to make me a latte sometime.

242
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:36,237
Yeah, sure.

243
00:25:36,637 --> 00:25:37,905
I'm gonna be honest,

244
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,341
I don't actually know
what's in a latte.

245
00:25:40,941 --> 00:25:44,712
Uh, espresso and steamed milk.

246
00:25:45,146 --> 00:25:46,213
How much?

247
00:25:47,081 --> 00:25:48,049
Sorry?

248
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:49,250
How much espresso,

249
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:50,651
how much steamed milk?

250
00:25:51,485 --> 00:25:54,188
I'm not sure.

251
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:57,526
You must know an amount.
Even a ballpark. Any amount.

252
00:25:58,426 --> 00:26:02,763
Two espresso
and a cup of steamed milk.

253
00:26:02,897 --> 00:26:04,932
So, how much liquid
is in a shot,

254
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:07,668
and how much
does milk cost in bulk?

255
00:26:08,936 --> 00:26:10,204
I'm not sure.

256
00:26:12,373 --> 00:26:16,911
So much of what we do is
an imperfect exact science.

257
00:26:17,078 --> 00:26:18,879
In order to forecast
for our client,

258
00:26:19,013 --> 00:26:20,648
you need to know
what it is they do.

259
00:26:20,815 --> 00:26:22,750
For example, latte.

260
00:26:22,883 --> 00:26:26,487
Maintenance,
overhead, variable costs.

261
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:29,190
We need to know
what they're capable of.

262
00:26:29,323 --> 00:26:31,892
I just didn't know
the measurements of the coffee--

263
00:26:32,026 --> 00:26:34,529
It's okay.
I believe that you worked there.

264
00:26:34,862 --> 00:26:37,698
I trust you, because deep down,

265
00:26:37,865 --> 00:26:39,568
I know what you're capable of.

266
00:26:39,934 --> 00:26:44,405
Risk is the possibility
of something bad happening.

267
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:48,209
And if you know the outcome,
even if it's bad,

268
00:26:48,342 --> 00:26:49,844
then there is no risk.

269
00:26:49,977 --> 00:26:54,482
And trust alleviates
a ton of risk.

270
00:26:54,815 --> 00:26:56,117
And I trust you.

271
00:26:56,551 --> 00:26:57,552
Do you trust me?

272
00:26:57,718 --> 00:26:59,019
-Yeah.
-Don't just say it

273
00:26:59,186 --> 00:27:00,421
because I'm your boss's boss.

274
00:27:00,555 --> 00:27:01,922
-Do you trust me?
-Yes.

275
00:27:02,056 --> 00:27:03,657
-Yes?
-Yes.

276
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:06,694
-Yes? Yes? Yes?
-Yes. Yes. Yes!

277
00:27:06,861 --> 00:27:08,295
All right. You're free to go.

278
00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:11,899
What?

279
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:15,269
That was me approving
your 90-day onboarding.

280
00:27:15,402 --> 00:27:17,938
Congrats.
You're still on board, kid.

281
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,209
Thank you.

282
00:27:27,681 --> 00:27:29,083
- Hey!
- Hey, hey!

283
00:27:29,216 --> 00:27:31,352
- Corey! Hi!
- Aunt Hera, I missed you!

284
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:34,321
-Tell me "I missed you too."
-I missed you guys.

285
00:27:34,455 --> 00:27:37,458
-How's it going?
-Good. How are you?

286
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:40,529
Aww.
Are you excited for tonight?

287
00:27:40,694 --> 00:27:42,363
-Yes.
-Yeah, me too.

288
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:44,165
-Awesome.
-All right.

289
00:27:47,268 --> 00:27:49,970
You know, when you said you were
making lasagna, I thought...

290
00:27:50,938 --> 00:27:53,440
well, I just thought
you'd be making it.

291
00:27:53,608 --> 00:27:54,742
I don't have time to cook.

292
00:27:55,075 --> 00:27:57,077
Oh, yeah. I get you're busy.

293
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:01,382
You know, when I was 23,
I was pregnant.

294
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:05,587
Working, married, cleaned.

295
00:28:05,753 --> 00:28:07,488
I'm in a really
competitive field.

296
00:28:07,888 --> 00:28:09,823
Okay?
If I don't advance quickly,

297
00:28:09,957 --> 00:28:11,292
then I'll just get stuck.

298
00:28:12,493 --> 00:28:13,694
There's a glass ceiling.

299
00:28:14,094 --> 00:28:16,730
You're 23, relax. You're fine.

300
00:28:16,897 --> 00:28:18,432
I want to make C-suite.

301
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:21,101
I don't wanna just
have some nothing job.

302
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:27,841
When you come over next week,

303
00:28:27,975 --> 00:28:29,644
I'll show you
some of mom's old recipes.

304
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:33,615
I don't even remember
what they tasted like.

305
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:36,250
It doesn't matter.
You need to learn how to cook.

306
00:28:36,917 --> 00:28:38,986
And clean, for God's sake.

307
00:28:39,153 --> 00:28:40,955
You moved in here,
what, three months ago?

308
00:28:41,222 --> 00:28:43,924
Still looks like there's
spiderwebs from the last person.

309
00:28:44,058 --> 00:28:46,961
Corey... how was school?

310
00:28:47,928 --> 00:28:49,797
Did they like your pigtails?

311
00:28:50,764 --> 00:28:53,334
A boy pulled my hair, Aunt Hera.

312
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:54,501
That means he likes you.

313
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:57,371
Her dad used to pull her hair.

314
00:28:57,505 --> 00:28:59,006
Don't say shit like that.

315
00:29:01,676 --> 00:29:02,943
Are you drawing something?

316
00:29:04,845 --> 00:29:06,113
Can I see?

317
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:11,885
What is it?

318
00:29:13,053 --> 00:29:14,955
A plant pod for you.

319
00:29:17,057 --> 00:29:18,392
A plant pod?

320
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,127
Miss Deven.

321
00:29:21,128 --> 00:29:22,530
She died last week.

322
00:29:22,697 --> 00:29:24,798
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry, honey.

323
00:29:25,266 --> 00:29:28,503
My teacher says
they put her in a bag

324
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,971
so her body can become flowers.

325
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:33,541
Okay, that's enough.

326
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:35,876
God, what are they
telling these kids?

327
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,478
Why did you draw me?

328
00:29:40,114 --> 00:29:42,416
Because flowers grow.

329
00:29:50,491 --> 00:29:52,293
Actually,
this lasagna's real good.

330
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:03,437
Hera.

331
00:30:15,182 --> 00:30:16,584
Hey,
I should only be a few hours.

332
00:30:16,718 --> 00:30:19,486
-This guy seems like a dud.
-How do you know?

333
00:30:20,655 --> 00:30:22,022
You can tell by his pics.

334
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:25,025
He's cute, but he's,
like, hiking and kayaking.

335
00:30:25,392 --> 00:30:29,396
But he's got a good job
and no kids, so, just drinks.

336
00:30:29,531 --> 00:30:33,267
I won't feel pressure to...

337
00:30:33,434 --> 00:30:35,737
All right. Well, how do I look?

338
00:30:36,136 --> 00:30:38,839
You look great.

339
00:30:49,383 --> 00:30:50,150
Corey?

340
00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:55,155
Corey?

341
00:30:58,626 --> 00:30:59,893
Come out.

342
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,584
Corey, what are you doing?

343
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,923
Is this about
what your teacher taught you?

344
00:31:47,975 --> 00:31:50,545
Oh, my God. No...

345
00:32:01,422 --> 00:32:03,691
- Hey.
- Hey.

346
00:32:03,858 --> 00:32:05,593
How'd it go?

347
00:32:05,727 --> 00:32:08,061
Eh, you know...

348
00:32:09,963 --> 00:32:11,432
I thought he was a dud.

349
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:13,434
He was.

350
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:16,738
But he was really sweet
and kinda hot, so...

351
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:19,641
we did stuff in his car.

352
00:32:19,774 --> 00:32:21,008
Is that what you wanted?

353
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:24,344
Yeah. I-- I told him I didn't
think it was gonna work out,

354
00:32:24,478 --> 00:32:26,581
and he was just saying
he liked me.

355
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:28,115
I don't know, it was cute,

356
00:32:28,248 --> 00:32:29,950
so I told him
what I wanted to do.

357
00:32:30,384 --> 00:32:31,753
He was cool with that.

358
00:32:32,186 --> 00:32:34,988
Might happen again.

359
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:37,124
Corey? You ready?

360
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:42,429
I didn't do anything wrong.

361
00:32:43,598 --> 00:32:44,699
I know.

362
00:32:45,065 --> 00:32:47,234
I had fun. I'm allowed to.

363
00:32:49,771 --> 00:32:52,339
I meant to tell you
about the guy at work.

364
00:32:52,774 --> 00:32:55,877
-The higher-up.
-Oh, the higher-up? Second date?

365
00:32:56,009 --> 00:32:57,478
Corey?

366
00:32:57,978 --> 00:33:00,515
Well, we went out, um...

367
00:33:01,148 --> 00:33:03,217
and then he dropped me off.

368
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,085
I'm sorry, what are you saying?

369
00:33:09,657 --> 00:33:12,459
I'm just really sad
he doesn't like me anymore.

370
00:33:14,061 --> 00:33:16,029
Like, he won't even talk to me.

371
00:33:19,868 --> 00:33:21,836
Oh, Hera.

372
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,337
What a prick.

373
00:33:23,872 --> 00:33:25,439
They can all be such assholes.

374
00:33:27,407 --> 00:33:29,443
-You okay?
-Mm-hmm.

375
00:33:29,577 --> 00:33:30,678
Okay.

376
00:33:31,078 --> 00:33:32,279
Where the hell is Corey?

377
00:33:32,714 --> 00:33:35,382
She fell asleep next to me.

378
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:37,417
How long ago?

379
00:33:38,753 --> 00:33:41,523
-I fell asleep too.
-Oh, my--

380
00:33:42,489 --> 00:33:43,558
Corey.

381
00:33:44,993 --> 00:33:46,026
Corey!

382
00:33:51,699 --> 00:33:53,635
- Corey, you in here?
- Mom?

383
00:33:57,906 --> 00:33:59,239
I saw the tree man.

384
00:33:59,406 --> 00:34:02,577
Oh, baby, it's okay.
Time to go home.

385
00:34:04,946 --> 00:34:06,146
You saw a tree man?

386
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,315
Are you feeding
into this with her?

387
00:34:08,448 --> 00:34:10,317
No more of this tree man stuff!

388
00:34:10,718 --> 00:34:12,486
God, this is exactly
why I feel so alone.

389
00:34:12,654 --> 00:34:15,455
I have to do everything on
my own, and what are you doing?

390
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:19,326
Come on, Corey.

391
00:34:19,459 --> 00:34:21,663
- Love you.
- Love you.

392
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:18,853
She looks like a dock worker.

393
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:40,835
Frank, I got that email.

394
00:36:40,968 --> 00:36:43,571
Tea time at 8:00.
I'm gonna whoop your ass.

395
00:36:46,306 --> 00:36:47,575
Zach?

396
00:37:21,743 --> 00:37:22,810
Zach.

397
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,854
...over our projections
for this year,

398
00:37:32,987 --> 00:37:35,523
and I think as we move forward,
what we--

399
00:37:41,896 --> 00:37:42,964
Hera.

400
00:37:43,097 --> 00:37:45,398
Did you have
the conference room booked?

401
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:47,068
No.

402
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:50,104
I just--
I had a question for Zach.

403
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:52,707
- Sorry to interrupt you guys.
- Okay.

404
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,742
- Back to business, then.
- What?

405
00:37:58,311 --> 00:37:59,580
What did you wanna know?

406
00:38:01,816 --> 00:38:02,884
Uh...

407
00:38:04,018 --> 00:38:05,285
Come on.

408
00:38:06,419 --> 00:38:07,688
Center of the room.

409
00:38:09,157 --> 00:38:10,423
Go on.

410
00:38:11,926 --> 00:38:12,994
Ask.

411
00:38:13,393 --> 00:38:15,029
Can you help me with something?

412
00:38:16,097 --> 00:38:17,165
What?

413
00:38:17,598 --> 00:38:21,468
Uh, I'm working on
some models for Lori.

414
00:38:21,636 --> 00:38:23,638
Um, I just-- I need your help--

415
00:38:23,771 --> 00:38:25,740
Hera,
what exactly do you wanna know?

416
00:38:29,744 --> 00:38:33,247
Capital asset
expected return rate.

417
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,750
Couldn't look it up?

418
00:38:41,522 --> 00:38:43,858
Risk-free rate
plus market sensitivity

419
00:38:44,025 --> 00:38:46,527
times difference
between expected return

420
00:38:46,661 --> 00:38:47,862
and risk-free rate.

421
00:38:48,029 --> 00:38:50,565
Thank you.

422
00:38:52,733 --> 00:38:54,001
You can leave now.

423
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:56,804
Sorry.

424
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:06,113
All right, let's talk about Q3.

425
00:39:24,932 --> 00:39:26,366
Oh. Hey.

426
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:30,671
Don't feel bad.
It was just a joke.

427
00:39:31,471 --> 00:39:33,140
Didn't feel like a joke.

428
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:36,777
I knew this was gonna happen.

429
00:39:38,346 --> 00:39:42,415
I don't know why we hire women
who don't plan on becoming CFAs.

430
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,985
You know I want to.

431
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,922
Yeah, but what else do you want?

432
00:39:51,292 --> 00:39:53,361
I thought you were special.

433
00:39:53,493 --> 00:39:56,429
Boy, was I wrong.

434
00:39:59,901 --> 00:40:03,070
You ever-- ever
think about being a teacher?

435
00:40:04,505 --> 00:40:05,873
Maybe a nurse?

436
00:40:07,275 --> 00:40:10,111
You could--
Oh, you could marry a rich guy.

437
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:11,812
I mean, you're hot, so...

438
00:40:11,946 --> 00:40:13,014
Yeah.

439
00:40:13,514 --> 00:40:16,017
Be a nice little
stay-at-home-mom.

440
00:40:19,553 --> 00:40:22,256
Oh, shit.
Is that what this is about?

441
00:40:22,757 --> 00:40:27,128
-I want this.
-Yeah, you aren't good at this.

442
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:33,167
Zach...

443
00:40:35,036 --> 00:40:36,170
What?

444
00:40:36,804 --> 00:40:39,840
Did you--
did you still want, um...

445
00:40:41,575 --> 00:40:43,177
At lunch in y-- in your car?

446
00:40:52,687 --> 00:40:53,955
Did you take the pill?

447
00:40:55,756 --> 00:40:56,991
Yesterday.

448
00:41:03,496 --> 00:41:05,465
I think it'd be weird if we...

449
00:41:07,268 --> 00:41:08,803
I mean, we're coworkers, right?

450
00:41:09,603 --> 00:41:11,072
So, uh...

451
00:41:12,006 --> 00:41:13,708
Yeah,
and I got stuff to do today.

452
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,812
What, are you gonna cry?

453
00:41:28,456 --> 00:41:29,724
Bless you.

454
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,075
Fucking women, man.

455
00:42:25,146 --> 00:42:27,448
Hey, hey!

456
00:42:27,982 --> 00:42:30,117
Lori, I am so sorry!

457
00:42:30,451 --> 00:42:31,819
Can I help you?

458
00:42:31,952 --> 00:42:33,587
I thought you were
somebody else, I'm so sorry!

459
00:42:33,754 --> 00:42:36,323
Go to the breakout room. Now!

460
00:42:45,299 --> 00:42:46,567
I'm so--

461
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:51,472
Hera.

462
00:42:51,872 --> 00:42:54,942
-What is going on with you?
-I'm sorry.

463
00:42:55,109 --> 00:42:56,977
Yesterday the dress
and today this.

464
00:42:57,111 --> 00:42:58,513
And you didn't
give me a breakdown!

465
00:42:58,646 --> 00:43:00,448
Ah!

466
00:43:00,781 --> 00:43:02,083
-Hello?
-Um...

467
00:43:02,216 --> 00:43:04,819
I know. It was late.
I was trying to, um...

468
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,189
-I'm sorry.
-Do not say sorry again.

469
00:43:09,757 --> 00:43:12,159
Don't.

470
00:43:12,293 --> 00:43:15,129
I asked Zach for help with
one of the equations.

471
00:43:15,296 --> 00:43:17,932
-That's why it was late.
-Don't do that!

472
00:43:18,065 --> 00:43:19,333
Ask the guys for help?

473
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,902
You either do the work
or you're let go.

474
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:26,006
-We don't get to make mistakes.
-Okay. I'm sorry.

475
00:43:26,907 --> 00:43:28,309
That's the last time.

476
00:43:43,558 --> 00:43:44,892
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey.

477
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:46,427
<i>I thought you couldn't</i>
<i>talk at work?</i>

478
00:43:47,094 --> 00:43:49,163
- I walked away from my desk.
<i>- Cool.</i>

479
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:52,633
<i>Well, I'm at the hospital,</i>
<i>so I can't talk long.</i>

480
00:43:54,702 --> 00:43:56,070
<i>Hera?</i>

481
00:43:57,304 --> 00:43:58,405
<i>Hera?</i>

482
00:43:59,106 --> 00:44:01,510
I didn't know who else to call.

483
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:02,977
I-- I don't know what I'm doing.

484
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,378
Okay? This is so hard.

485
00:44:04,513 --> 00:44:06,380
This is so hard,
I don't know what I'm doing.

486
00:44:06,515 --> 00:44:08,782
<i>Just take a breath. It's okay.</i>

487
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:11,452
<i>No one's gonna die</i>
<i>if you mess up.</i>

488
00:44:11,586 --> 00:44:12,853
<i>It's okay.</i>

489
00:44:15,756 --> 00:44:18,627
-Yeah.
<i>-Bad stuff happens, but...</i>

490
00:44:19,426 --> 00:44:21,295
<i>we can't just stop</i>
<i>because of it.</i>

491
00:44:22,163 --> 00:44:25,833
<i>On to the next patient,</i>
<i>and on to the next, right?</i>

492
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:28,603
-On to the next.
<i>-Good.</i>

493
00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:30,572
<i>Okay, I really gotta run.</i>

494
00:44:31,071 --> 00:44:33,240
<i>-Love you.</i>
-Love you too, Demi.

495
00:44:33,974 --> 00:44:35,676
Thank you.

496
00:44:50,024 --> 00:44:51,725
Could you get the door for me?

497
00:44:54,228 --> 00:44:57,064
Cute plant.

498
00:44:57,198 --> 00:44:58,866
- Thanks.
- So cute.

499
00:44:59,033 --> 00:45:00,734
I think
I'm gonna call her Grace.

500
00:45:01,902 --> 00:45:03,170
Okay!

501
00:45:04,506 --> 00:45:05,940
It was a gift.

502
00:45:08,643 --> 00:45:09,977
Uh, I like your shoes.

503
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,413
Thank you!

504
00:45:19,688 --> 00:45:21,255
Can you get the door for me?

505
00:45:24,693 --> 00:45:26,460
Oh. You know what?

506
00:45:26,628 --> 00:45:29,730
I'm so sorry. I'm meeting Zach.

507
00:45:30,565 --> 00:45:31,832
Sorry.

508
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:30,157
I know.

509
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:34,529
I know.

510
00:46:43,571 --> 00:46:44,805
Lasagna.

511
00:47:09,731 --> 00:47:12,099
Do you want some?

512
00:48:49,531 --> 00:48:51,231
Did you get a new account?

513
00:48:51,365 --> 00:48:54,669
Holy shit, you've been here,
what, three months?

514
00:48:54,803 --> 00:48:55,770
Ring it!

515
00:48:55,936 --> 00:48:59,173
Hey, everyone! Ring it.

516
00:48:59,306 --> 00:49:01,108
- I can't.
- You--

517
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:03,177
You have to. They expect you to.
You--

518
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,913
We have to
go through with it now.

519
00:49:07,381 --> 00:49:11,084
So, what was the account?
How much was it for?

520
00:49:12,754 --> 00:49:13,822
I didn't.

521
00:49:14,488 --> 00:49:17,224
I just was looking at the bell.

522
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:19,226
Wha--

523
00:49:19,493 --> 00:49:21,395
Why didn't you say anything?

524
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,732
She's got nothing.

525
00:49:26,033 --> 00:49:27,769
God, you look like an idiot.

526
00:49:40,515 --> 00:49:41,583
Come in.

527
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:43,618
Hera.

528
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,388
-Good morning, Lori.
-Mmm.

529
00:49:51,992 --> 00:49:54,629
I heard you just got back
from a family trip.

530
00:49:55,362 --> 00:49:57,765
I have time for one trip a year.

531
00:49:58,398 --> 00:50:00,100
Too busy for family, though.

532
00:50:01,301 --> 00:50:02,971
-You doing okay?
-Yeah.

533
00:50:03,872 --> 00:50:06,608
Good, cool. So,
I wanted to talk to you about...

534
00:50:06,741 --> 00:50:09,109
-day and a half late, but--
-I know, I'm sorry, I--

535
00:50:09,243 --> 00:50:11,144
But-- Can I finish?

536
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:17,886
But you didn't
just do the report.

537
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:20,187
You did all of it.

538
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,756
The entire thing. Forecasting,

539
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:25,125
and your risk transfer
recommendations are spot-on.

540
00:50:25,259 --> 00:50:27,227
-Yeah?
-Yes.

541
00:50:28,262 --> 00:50:30,899
We need to find
a happy medium here.

542
00:50:31,398 --> 00:50:33,768
You went from
prom dress to trash can.

543
00:50:35,035 --> 00:50:36,671
And you look sick. Are you sick?

544
00:50:37,137 --> 00:50:38,540
-I'm not sick.
-If you're sick,

545
00:50:38,673 --> 00:50:40,207
you need to tell me.
I can't get sick right now.

546
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,609
I'm not sick.

547
00:50:43,878 --> 00:50:44,879
Okay.

548
00:50:45,013 --> 00:50:46,413
If you can keep doing this,

549
00:50:46,581 --> 00:50:48,315
fit in a bit better,
then in a few months,

550
00:50:48,482 --> 00:50:50,618
we can talk about
funding your CFA classes.

551
00:50:50,785 --> 00:50:51,953
I would love that.

552
00:50:52,085 --> 00:50:55,055
That's exactly what I need
to become a real analyst.

553
00:50:55,188 --> 00:50:57,324
Gabe recommended you
for CFA training.

554
00:50:57,457 --> 00:50:58,760
He said you've been
helping him out.

555
00:50:59,894 --> 00:51:00,929
Gabe did?

556
00:51:01,094 --> 00:51:02,429
Yes. Uh, go check your email.

557
00:51:02,597 --> 00:51:04,431
I sent you and Vicky
some things to review.

558
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:08,636
-Vicky?
-Yes. Your little plant buddy?

559
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:11,171
Are you having trouble hearing?
Do you not hear well?

560
00:51:11,305 --> 00:51:12,774
I can hear well.

561
00:51:13,273 --> 00:51:15,442
Okay. Uh,
it's not, like, a sinus thing?

562
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:18,078
Because your face
does look puffy.

563
00:51:19,013 --> 00:51:20,682
-I'm not sick.
-Okay.

564
00:51:20,815 --> 00:51:22,817
You must have hearing loss,
then.

565
00:51:23,216 --> 00:51:25,452
Because you rang
that fucking bell.

566
00:51:28,823 --> 00:51:30,157
You can shut that.

567
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,442
Oh, hey. Come on in.

568
00:51:49,376 --> 00:51:51,244
- Hey.
- Hey. Shut the door.

569
00:52:00,153 --> 00:52:03,490
So Lori told me that you
recommended me for CFA classes?

570
00:52:03,658 --> 00:52:05,727
Oh, absolutely.
You're crushing it.

571
00:52:05,893 --> 00:52:07,127
Thanks.

572
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,396
We haven't worked
together at all.

573
00:52:12,066 --> 00:52:13,568
Look, I'm gonna be honest.

574
00:52:15,235 --> 00:52:17,071
Zach and I tag-team accounts,

575
00:52:17,204 --> 00:52:19,641
so I've seen your work.

576
00:52:20,173 --> 00:52:22,076
He goes in and schmoozes,

577
00:52:22,209 --> 00:52:24,545
and I do
the actual heavy lifting.

578
00:52:25,046 --> 00:52:26,313
Then we both win.

579
00:52:27,882 --> 00:52:29,282
You're not Ivy League

580
00:52:29,449 --> 00:52:31,719
like Zach, Vicky,

581
00:52:32,252 --> 00:52:33,655
a bunch of people.

582
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:37,224
Ivy Leaguers play the game.

583
00:52:37,558 --> 00:52:39,426
They don't put in the hours.

584
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:41,562
And...

585
00:52:41,896 --> 00:52:45,033
Zach told me that things didn't
work out between you two.

586
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:48,936
Should I go to HR
about what happened?

587
00:52:49,103 --> 00:52:51,304
No. Don't go to HR.

588
00:52:52,073 --> 00:52:56,811
I mean, if my wife or daughter
were in your situation?

589
00:52:56,944 --> 00:52:58,311
Jesus.

590
00:52:58,478 --> 00:53:02,382
All right, HR's job is
to protect the company.

591
00:53:02,517 --> 00:53:03,851
You go to them and tell them

592
00:53:03,985 --> 00:53:05,987
that you had a fling
that went bad?

593
00:53:06,754 --> 00:53:08,455
Who do you think
they're gonna take care of--

594
00:53:08,623 --> 00:53:11,224
and I'm just being honest here--

595
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:12,527
a top earner,

596
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:16,229
or a female junior analyst?

597
00:53:23,771 --> 00:53:26,206
I just want you to
get the help that you deserve,

598
00:53:26,574 --> 00:53:29,476
because it's hard enough
being a woman in the workplace.

599
00:53:36,517 --> 00:53:39,319
That's really awesome of you,
Gabe.

600
00:53:39,921 --> 00:53:41,889
Us state-schoolers
gotta stick together.

601
00:53:45,093 --> 00:53:46,460
Thank you.

602
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:19,493
-Jesus!
-Don't touch my plant.

603
00:54:19,627 --> 00:54:21,495
Are you being serious right now?

604
00:54:24,565 --> 00:54:26,000
Why do you have
the same plant as me?

605
00:54:26,134 --> 00:54:30,671
Oh, well,
I went to the grocery store.

606
00:54:30,805 --> 00:54:34,809
Your little plant cost $12.

607
00:54:39,479 --> 00:54:40,982
I'm here now. What do you want?

608
00:54:41,481 --> 00:54:44,284
Oh. Do you wanna go to lunch?

609
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:46,386
Zach and I are going to lunch.

610
00:54:47,121 --> 00:54:48,556
Except...

611
00:54:49,123 --> 00:54:51,424
I'm actually hungry.

612
00:54:55,797 --> 00:54:57,330
Ow, Jesus!

613
00:54:59,499 --> 00:55:02,537
What the fuck is wrong with you?

614
00:55:07,575 --> 00:55:09,342
Hera just pulled my hair.

615
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:12,647
Hera just hit me,
and now my neck hurts!

616
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,849
Are you okay?

617
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:16,884
I don't know!

618
00:55:17,018 --> 00:55:18,786
I don't know
what is going on with you

619
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:22,290
or what kind of psychotic break
that you're having,

620
00:55:22,455 --> 00:55:25,226
but I-- I'm going to sue you,

621
00:55:25,693 --> 00:55:28,428
and you need to get help.

622
00:55:28,563 --> 00:55:30,198
God, my neck really hurts

623
00:55:30,363 --> 00:55:31,699
and I don't know--

624
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,676
What the fuck?

625
00:57:16,637 --> 00:57:18,739
I want this to fucking hurt.

626
00:57:23,511 --> 00:57:25,179
I fucking hate you!

627
00:57:33,754 --> 00:57:37,625
Yeah! Whoo!

628
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:43,397
Is everyone seeing this? Whoo!

629
00:58:06,554 --> 00:58:09,190
Stop.

630
00:58:10,358 --> 00:58:11,792
Stop!

631
00:58:12,526 --> 00:58:13,828
Stop!

632
00:58:14,028 --> 00:58:16,297
Stop, stop!

633
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:19,266
Stop, stop, stop. Stop--

634
00:58:25,573 --> 00:58:26,841
What's going on?

635
00:58:30,711 --> 00:58:31,979
I fell asleep.

636
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,548
You can't sleep here.

637
00:58:34,682 --> 00:58:36,417
And we talked about
how you're dressed.

638
00:58:37,184 --> 00:58:39,553
Do you have
a learning disability?

639
00:58:41,355 --> 00:58:43,357
It's okay if you do, but we
need to talk about options for--

640
00:58:43,524 --> 00:58:44,959
What the fuck is this?

641
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,895
Vicky, what's going on?

642
00:58:51,232 --> 00:58:52,299
Did you do this, Hera?

643
00:58:54,468 --> 00:58:56,904
Did you fucking do this, Hera?

644
00:58:59,206 --> 00:59:01,575
I come into my office,
my plant is dead,

645
00:59:01,709 --> 00:59:03,144
it's swimming in salt,

646
00:59:03,277 --> 00:59:06,414
and my trash bin
is full of salt packets.

647
00:59:06,747 --> 00:59:08,282
Wonder how that happened, Hera?

648
00:59:08,416 --> 00:59:09,717
Hera?

649
00:59:10,684 --> 00:59:13,654
-I-- I don't know.
-This is bullshit.

650
00:59:15,322 --> 00:59:16,991
I'm gonna rip yours apart.

651
00:59:18,592 --> 00:59:19,860
Don't.

652
00:59:28,369 --> 00:59:30,137
Oh, my God!

653
00:59:33,908 --> 00:59:36,243
What the fuck is wrong with you?

654
00:59:36,377 --> 00:59:37,478
Oh, my God.

655
00:59:43,717 --> 00:59:46,320
Oh, my God!

656
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:53,794
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

657
00:59:54,428 --> 00:59:56,897
What the fuck is wrong with you?

658
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:04,138
You okay?

659
01:00:05,473 --> 01:00:07,675
Is it cool if
I sit with you for a minute?

660
01:00:14,583 --> 01:00:15,916
Crazy morning.

661
01:00:18,352 --> 01:00:19,820
Vicky's kind of a bitch.

662
01:00:23,124 --> 01:00:26,093
I get why you're mad.
She's hooking up with Zach.

663
01:00:26,994 --> 01:00:28,329
It's just so shitty.

664
01:00:29,196 --> 01:00:30,264
It sucks.

665
01:00:35,436 --> 01:00:38,540
Plus, that stupid flower thing
he does with every girl?

666
01:00:39,106 --> 01:00:41,442
-It's not stupid.
-No, no.

667
01:00:41,876 --> 01:00:43,144
Yeah, I mean...

668
01:00:43,612 --> 01:00:44,879
yours is great.

669
01:00:48,315 --> 01:00:50,017
Do you wanna give Zach
his jacket back?

670
01:01:07,569 --> 01:01:08,669
You know, uh,

671
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:13,407
I can intro you
to some other firms.

672
01:01:13,542 --> 01:01:16,410
You're a talented analyst,
and they'd be down to meet.

673
01:01:17,878 --> 01:01:19,346
Thanks.

674
01:01:21,415 --> 01:01:25,319
You wanna get coffee and
we can talk about it some time?

675
01:01:27,121 --> 01:01:28,189
Dinner?

676
01:01:29,558 --> 01:01:30,824
Whatever.

677
01:01:32,661 --> 01:01:33,794
Do you need money?

678
01:01:34,128 --> 01:01:35,396
'Cause I can give you money.

679
01:01:36,797 --> 01:01:39,466
I can give you $1,000.

680
01:01:39,601 --> 01:01:42,002
It just has to be our secret.

681
01:01:49,143 --> 01:01:52,079
-Is that a yes?
-Don't touch me.

682
01:01:52,246 --> 01:01:54,081
-I was just--
-Leave me alone.

683
01:02:31,852 --> 01:02:33,420
Why?

684
01:02:35,222 --> 01:02:37,258
Why?

685
01:02:38,058 --> 01:02:42,196
What am I supposed to do now?

686
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,102
What am I supposed to do now?

687
01:02:53,774 --> 01:02:56,010
What am I gonna do now?

688
01:02:58,779 --> 01:03:01,849
What do you want?

689
01:03:03,652 --> 01:03:06,020
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

690
01:03:07,988 --> 01:03:10,725
Do you think that
this is some kind of joke?

691
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:18,132
I know a joke.

692
01:03:21,135 --> 01:03:23,137
Fuck!

693
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,690
Yes!

694
01:03:47,961 --> 01:03:49,631
I'll kill everything,

695
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:52,132
and I'll make you watch!

696
01:03:54,134 --> 01:03:56,236
I'm a carnivore too!

697
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:01,108
I hate you!

698
01:04:07,247 --> 01:04:11,018
Yeah!

699
01:07:23,745 --> 01:07:26,213
-All right, you stay in the car.
-But Mom--

700
01:07:36,558 --> 01:07:37,625
Hera?

701
01:07:38,993 --> 01:07:40,260
Hera!

702
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:47,702
Mom!

703
01:07:47,835 --> 01:07:49,704
Come on...

704
01:07:49,837 --> 01:07:51,940
Come on, Hera.

705
01:07:52,072 --> 01:07:53,741
Please don't be dead.

706
01:08:00,615 --> 01:08:02,917
Hera?

707
01:08:03,618 --> 01:08:05,152
Hera, I see you in there.

708
01:08:05,553 --> 01:08:07,354
Hera, let me the fuck in.

709
01:08:17,899 --> 01:08:19,601
What are you doing?

710
01:08:21,536 --> 01:08:23,103
I'm breathing.

711
01:08:24,204 --> 01:08:25,472
Ugh!

712
01:08:26,774 --> 01:08:28,241
God!

713
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,569
Do you wanna tell me
what's going on?

714
01:08:55,003 --> 01:08:57,137
Tell me, because this is crazy.

715
01:08:57,772 --> 01:08:59,107
You didn't come over
for Monday dinner.

716
01:08:59,239 --> 01:09:00,708
You haven't answered your phone.

717
01:09:00,842 --> 01:09:04,211
Work said you got let go
last week for stabbing someone?

718
01:09:04,344 --> 01:09:06,346
She attacked Grace.

719
01:09:06,514 --> 01:09:09,282
- What?
- She attacked Grace!

720
01:09:10,885 --> 01:09:12,352
My flower.

721
01:09:13,655 --> 01:09:14,722
Mine.

722
01:09:16,090 --> 01:09:17,157
Where is it?

723
01:09:17,692 --> 01:09:20,061
Or is it with the trees
you keep talking about?

724
01:09:20,795 --> 01:09:22,396
Do you know
how fucking hard it is

725
01:09:22,563 --> 01:09:24,565
to barely have time
to be a single mom,

726
01:09:24,699 --> 01:09:26,466
and work 60 hours a week,

727
01:09:26,601 --> 01:09:28,770
and take care of
an adult fucking woman?

728
01:09:34,909 --> 01:09:37,011
Crap.
I have to take Corey to therapy.

729
01:09:39,547 --> 01:09:42,750
-It's fine.
-Grace! Grace!

730
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:51,793
He told me to do it.

731
01:09:58,231 --> 01:09:59,332
Hera?

732
01:09:59,967 --> 01:10:03,303
Hera? Oh, my God.
You okay? You okay?

733
01:10:03,705 --> 01:10:06,007
What the fuck is wrong with you?

734
01:10:08,943 --> 01:10:10,678
Hera, what the fuck?

735
01:10:11,846 --> 01:10:13,114
Oh, my God.

736
01:10:13,915 --> 01:10:16,784
I'm taking your keys away.

737
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:23,591
Can you help her?

738
01:11:09,302 --> 01:11:11,906
Zach!

739
01:11:12,039 --> 01:11:15,877
Zach! Zach! Zach!

740
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:24,719
Zach?

741
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,288
Zach? Zach.

742
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:30,892
Vicky.

743
01:11:31,826 --> 01:11:33,261
Vicky, where's Zach?

744
01:11:33,426 --> 01:11:34,962
- I don't know.
- Where's Zach?

745
01:11:35,096 --> 01:11:36,631
I don't know,
he doesn't talk to me anymore!

746
01:11:36,764 --> 01:11:38,966
-Where is he?
-Hera, stop! What is going on?

747
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:41,702
Please, I need Zach.
I'll do whatever he wants,

748
01:11:41,836 --> 01:11:43,805
but Grace,
she's ours and she's dying!

749
01:11:43,938 --> 01:11:45,706
What the fuck
are you talking about?

750
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,407
You need to get out of here.

751
01:11:47,542 --> 01:11:49,610
It is a fucking plant!

752
01:11:50,878 --> 01:11:52,947
He made me take
the morning-after pill,

753
01:11:53,114 --> 01:11:54,549
but Grace, she's dying.

754
01:11:54,682 --> 01:11:57,384
I need someone to help her!

755
01:11:58,953 --> 01:11:59,821
Now, listen.

756
01:12:00,254 --> 01:12:01,989
I'll be good to you.
I'm gonna be good to you,

757
01:12:02,123 --> 01:12:03,858
but you need to leave
or I'm calling the cops

758
01:12:03,991 --> 01:12:06,861
and slapping a restraining order
on your ass. Do you hear me?

759
01:12:09,396 --> 01:12:12,934
Okay. Okay.

760
01:12:52,974 --> 01:12:54,809
Do you wanna tell me
what the hell's going on?

761
01:12:57,111 --> 01:12:58,846
Where are we going?

762
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:00,014
My house.

763
01:13:02,283 --> 01:13:03,483
I wanna go home.

764
01:13:03,618 --> 01:13:05,253
Why the fuck
would I take you there?

765
01:13:05,418 --> 01:13:07,722
So you can make me leave work
in the middle of the day again?

766
01:13:11,391 --> 01:13:12,660
The higher-up...

767
01:13:15,462 --> 01:13:17,131
I didn't wanna
have sex with him.

768
01:13:18,366 --> 01:13:19,967
What?

769
01:13:20,601 --> 01:13:22,770
And he made me take
the morning-after pill.

770
01:13:24,437 --> 01:13:26,807
Oh, Hera,
why didn't you tell me?

771
01:13:26,941 --> 01:13:28,743
I tried.

772
01:13:28,876 --> 01:13:29,944
Grace...

773
01:13:31,646 --> 01:13:32,914
The plant.

774
01:13:34,382 --> 01:13:35,983
I loved her so much.

775
01:13:37,151 --> 01:13:39,854
She made me feel like
nothing bad had ever happened.

776
01:13:42,957 --> 01:13:44,659
I didn't mean to hit Corey.

777
01:13:47,361 --> 01:13:50,031
She's been drawing you
flowers ever since it happened.

778
01:13:52,233 --> 01:13:53,567
She feels bad.

779
01:13:54,602 --> 01:13:55,736
She shouldn't feel bad.

780
01:13:56,370 --> 01:13:58,739
No one should ever hit her,
including me.

781
01:14:00,341 --> 01:14:01,642
I'm really sorry.

782
01:14:06,747 --> 01:14:08,649
I really just wanna go home,
though.

783
01:14:10,551 --> 01:14:14,487
I-- I need to clean up
and-- and sleep in my own bed.

784
01:14:16,557 --> 01:14:18,159
I won't do anything stupid.

785
01:14:19,026 --> 01:14:19,961
Okay.

786
01:14:20,361 --> 01:14:23,064
But I'll be over tomorrow
morning to check on you.

787
01:14:24,699 --> 01:14:26,499
You can apologize to Corey.

788
01:15:50,217 --> 01:15:51,285
Goodbye.

789
01:17:09,663 --> 01:17:11,665
I have to go to the bathroom.

790
01:18:28,309 --> 01:18:30,110
Coming.

791
01:18:43,724 --> 01:18:46,126
- Hey?
- You good?

792
01:18:47,962 --> 01:18:49,196
Are you drunk?

793
01:18:49,363 --> 01:18:51,865
Uh, a couple of us
went out after work.

794
01:18:53,934 --> 01:18:56,737
Figured I'd come...
check on my girl.

795
01:18:58,038 --> 01:18:59,840
You-- you okay? You wanna--

796
01:18:59,974 --> 01:19:02,876
-Hey, do you wanna talk about--
-No, not really.

797
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:04,778
I thought I was your mentor.

798
01:19:05,913 --> 01:19:07,181
You need to go.

799
01:19:07,515 --> 01:19:09,049
Gabe just dropped me off.

800
01:19:09,584 --> 01:19:12,152
You want me to get a ride?
That's gonna be, like, $50.

801
01:19:12,319 --> 01:19:16,023
-I could really use some coffee.
-I don't have any coffee.

802
01:19:16,924 --> 01:19:18,192
Okay.

803
01:19:18,627 --> 01:19:20,361
All right.

804
01:19:20,861 --> 01:19:23,030
But you gotta tell me
what's going on.

805
01:19:24,164 --> 01:19:26,767
What, you were crying for me
all day and now...

806
01:19:27,234 --> 01:19:29,203
now, what?
You-- you won't look at me?

807
01:19:32,973 --> 01:19:35,009
Have you started
applying for jobs yet?

808
01:19:35,677 --> 01:19:38,312
I mean, that must have
been really embarrassing.

809
01:19:41,015 --> 01:19:42,684
I could write you
a letter of recommendation,

810
01:19:42,816 --> 01:19:44,519
maybe make a couple phone calls.

811
01:19:45,452 --> 01:19:48,188
Hey, just-- just
as long as us hooking up

812
01:19:48,322 --> 01:19:50,324
doesn't get out, you know?

813
01:19:51,792 --> 01:19:53,093
Okay?

814
01:19:53,894 --> 01:19:54,895
What?

815
01:19:55,062 --> 01:19:56,564
I thought we had a good time--

816
01:19:58,132 --> 01:20:00,568
I thought we had a good time.

817
01:20:00,735 --> 01:20:03,003
What was good?

818
01:20:03,137 --> 01:20:05,205
-Well, you were great.
-At?

819
01:20:06,541 --> 01:20:08,809
-Getting fucked by me.
-Please let me go.

820
01:20:08,942 --> 01:20:10,978
-Oh, Hera.
-Please, let me go!

821
01:20:11,111 --> 01:20:13,480
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

822
01:20:22,189 --> 01:20:23,725
All right. What-- what is wrong?

823
01:20:23,857 --> 01:20:25,326
You did this to me.

824
01:20:25,794 --> 01:20:29,029
What are you talking about?
You just pushed me off of you.

825
01:20:29,897 --> 01:20:32,299
I didn't want to
and you forced me.

826
01:20:32,833 --> 01:20:34,602
I didn't force you
to do anything.

827
01:20:34,935 --> 01:20:37,504
You ruined everything for me!

828
01:20:37,672 --> 01:20:39,206
My career!

829
01:20:39,774 --> 01:20:41,008
Can you keep your voice down?

830
01:20:41,141 --> 01:20:42,544
You raped me.

831
01:20:44,078 --> 01:20:45,446
If you say that shit again--

832
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:48,015
-What, that you raped me?
-You need to back down.

833
01:20:49,551 --> 01:20:52,119
See, this is why
you couldn't handle the job,

834
01:20:52,587 --> 01:20:53,987
or a relationship.

835
01:20:54,922 --> 01:20:56,591
You are fucking crazy.

836
01:20:58,158 --> 01:20:59,828
And now you want people
to feel sorry for you?

837
01:21:00,027 --> 01:21:01,563
Is-- is this a cry for help?

838
01:21:04,131 --> 01:21:07,101
You are just another
dumb fucking slut

839
01:21:07,267 --> 01:21:10,871
trying to whore her way to
the top of the corporate ladder.

840
01:21:12,574 --> 01:21:14,609
Oh. Are you gonna cry?

841
01:21:15,376 --> 01:21:18,680
You gonna cry some more? Huh?

842
01:21:18,813 --> 01:21:22,349
You couldn't even take care
of a stupid fucking plant!

843
01:21:23,016 --> 01:21:24,686
You can't keep a plant alive?

844
01:21:24,853 --> 01:21:28,590
What the fuck?

845
01:21:34,161 --> 01:21:37,364
Stop, stop, stop! Stop...

846
01:21:48,075 --> 01:21:49,644
I-- I'm sorry.

847
01:21:50,944 --> 01:21:52,212
Please...

848
01:21:53,213 --> 01:21:54,481
let-- let me go.

849
01:21:58,419 --> 01:22:02,356
I'll get--
I'll get you... a better job.

850
01:22:08,996 --> 01:22:11,365
I am the glass ceiling.

851
01:23:29,443 --> 01:23:31,011
You drew all these for me?

852
01:23:31,746 --> 01:23:33,781
- I felt really bad about--
- It's okay.

853
01:23:34,582 --> 01:23:36,818
You saw something beautiful
and you wanted it.

854
01:23:37,619 --> 01:23:39,921
Next time we'll ask permission,
though, okay?

855
01:23:40,922 --> 01:23:44,091
But no one should ever
hit or touch you.

856
01:23:44,224 --> 01:23:46,026
Okay? And I'm really sorry.

857
01:23:46,961 --> 01:23:48,596
And if anyone does, you tell me.

858
01:23:49,463 --> 01:23:51,031
Okay?

859
01:23:51,164 --> 01:23:52,534
Okay, Aunt Hera.

860
01:23:55,803 --> 01:23:57,070
These are really good.

861
01:23:58,973 --> 01:24:00,307
You know, I used to draw.

862
01:24:00,975 --> 01:24:03,343
- I might start again.
- You should.

863
01:24:05,312 --> 01:24:07,114
Do you wanna see something nice?

864
01:24:14,288 --> 01:24:15,557
Look at that.

865
01:24:20,929 --> 01:24:22,296
It grew!

866
01:24:24,999 --> 01:24:26,266
Are we safe?
