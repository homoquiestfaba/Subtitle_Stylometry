1
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,606
See you monday.

2
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,612
Where are you going now?
I'm going home.

3
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:48,280
No.

4
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:49,581
Yeah.

5
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,668
What did it sMell like?

6
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,237
Animal. Meat.

7
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:48,440
My boss, he call over here.
Nothing.

8
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,542
Neighbor said,
"I can hear the sound...
this animal."

9
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,211
Handcuff.

10
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,380
Like, in jail?

11
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:57,616
They shackled him
to the radiator?

12
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,284
Look.

13
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:04,189
It's just a baby too.

14
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,525
Not full-grown.

15
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:08,527
Trying to get out.

16
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,533
It's not our fault, the tiger.

17
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:16,702
You write that, right?

18
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,171
Uh...

19
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,309
Sorry. I just...
I need some air.

20
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,600
This is no kind of thing.

21
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,569
I don't want to hide.

22
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,314
They're little.

23
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,350
They're buried stories,
I guess,

24
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,287
but... They're yours,

25
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:10,956
so you get attached.

26
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,758
It's not offbeat.

27
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,694
It's news,
and if you put it
in offbeat,

28
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,530
it makes it...
it makes it sound
like a joke.

29
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,699
This is a really
good story, Raj.

30
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,334
Look, relax, Leigh.

31
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,608
Hey! Thank you.

32
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,577
We're very happy.

33
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:33,979
She was very happy.

34
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:37,282
Well, about time
I manned up, right?

35
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,559
To the tiger.

36
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,494
May the road rise.

37
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,664
May the tiger...
don't say anything
about the tiger.

38
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,000
May the tiger run free
in tiger heaven...

39
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:57,436
Where the steaks
are plentiful...

40
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,405
And there's
a lot of tree stumps
for scratching.

Well, I...

here you go, moose.
Go on, bud.

70
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:09,668
Are you sure about the...
why did you bring your cat?

71
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,903
Because I couldn't leave him?

72
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:15,006
Well, couldn't you have
a friend look in on him or...

73
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,608
look in on him?
Uh-huh.

74
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,511
Mom. I'm calling peta.

75
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:22,814
Well, we don't have
a litter box, so...

76
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,525
mom?
Yeah?

77
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:36,061
What? No, no, no!
Don't move anything!

78
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,896
There's an order
to all of this.

79
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,998
Okay.
Okay.

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,666
Are you stripping?

81
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:43,068
No.
Are you sure?

82
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,037
It's belly dancing.
I started a new class.

83
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,441
I... I have four students.

84
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:53,678
And is this the name
that you chose?
"Dance mamas"?

85
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,014
- Really?
- yeah. Ha, ha, ha.

86
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,583
I happen to like the name.
Please, just don't
mess anything up.

87
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,453
- I'm trying to
start a business.
- oh. Can I keep this?

88
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:04,089
- Hi! Hi!
- there she is. Hi, baby.

89
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:08,860
Oh, give me a hug!
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

90
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,066
I wanna move back in
with you guys.

91
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,868
Honey, you're 30 years old.

92
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,004
I'm 29. I'm 29.

93
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,639
And 10 months.

94
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:26,578
I've never, you know,
asked for...

95
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:32,017
I just need some time out
of my life.

96
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:35,454
Well, we all do.

97
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,124
Are you all right, Leigh?

98
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,826
Yeah.

99
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:43,528
I just don't want to turn 30...

100
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,933
And still be
in that life anymore.

101
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:51,036
Well, what's wrong
with the life you have
in the city?

102
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:52,704
It's not...

103
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,575
it's not good.
I mean, I'm not...

104
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:58,710
I'm not happy.

105
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,479
You're depressed?

106
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:03,014
Is that it?
Are you depressed?

107
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:06,117
No. Not c... clinically.

108
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:12,257
My life hasn't turned out
like I pictured.

109
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:13,925
Well...

110
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:18,029
well. It's just nice
to have you here.

111
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,698
Okay?

112
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,872
If you're gonna stay here,

113
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:28,907
you have to contribute.

114
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,575
To what?

115
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,045
Okay.

116
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,882
Of course.

117
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:07,846
I would... I would say
you both have
a very keen eye...

118
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:10,148
Because this painting
represents...

119
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:14,553
A very small percentage
of what he produced.

120
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,555
And this is a happier piece...

121
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:23,128
um, this is one
of the happier pieces.

122
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:23,895
Um, but there's a...

123
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:33,872
if I'm gone for 30 minutes, nobody notices.
Nobody even cares.

124
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:35,740
This is your ideal job.

125
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:40,679
How long are you here for?
I think a while.

126
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:43,782
Like... A while.

127
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:48,253
Why?
I'm getting back
to basics.

128
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,324
What about your job?

129
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:54,326
Yeah.

130
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:56,027
No.

131
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,998
What about your boss?

132
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,833
He...

133
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:04,169
um, that guy's engaged.

134
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,772
Leigh-Leigh.

135
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,076
Why are you just standing here?

136
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:15,347
I need you
to cancel your plans
with anyone else ever.

137
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:17,682
Okay.
Have you seen Mel?

138
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,218
No. Why?
You should probably
see Mel.

139
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:24,356
I'm home!

140
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,927
No. You guys can talk.

141
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:31,963
Sorry. I'm gonna...
I'm here, but I'm...
I'll close...

142
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:37,869
<i>Get Back To The Island</i>

143
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:41,773

<i>Get Back To The Sun</i>
<i>So we can feel it again</i>

149
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,830
I saw Todd.

150
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,967
I know. I can't...

151
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,735
thirty, still in the closet.

152
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,837
Seriously?
It's like...

153
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,907
hey, do you still smoke?
I'm not supposed to.

154
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,676
What, are they bad for you?

155
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,445
Um... well...

156
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,684
No, we're trying
to get pregnant.

157
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,321
Like, with a human baby?
Mm-hmm.

158
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:34,292
But it's been
about six months,
and there's just...

159
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,329
Nothing happening.

160
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,766
It'll happen.

161
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:43,401
It'll happen.

162
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,942
So you don't... no.

163
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:52,410
Yes. Yes.

164
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,246
I will.
All right.

165
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,017
Don't tell John.

166
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,853
Okay.
Oh, shit. Can anyone
see me, do you think?

167
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,956
Mmm. Maybe.

168
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,126
Well, then we should go.
Wow.

169
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,729
Teen mom.

170
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:17,268

176
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,152
I have a plan.

177
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,421
- You have a plan?
- a good plan.

178
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,389
I'm gonna lifeguard.

179
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:40,225
What?

180
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,327
- She was a lifeguard
in high school.
- and college.

181
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:46,498
- Where?
- fox crest condo complex.
It's really good money.

182
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,032
It's good money?

183
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,401
How much?
Wait. Can I...
hold on.

184
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:53,772
I'm sorry.
Can I just say, what the hell
are you talking about?

185
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:53,772
It's like
nine-something an hour.

186
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:59,978
You realize that minimum wage
is 8.25 now, so that's...
that's not exactly...

187
00:12:59,980 --> 00:12:59,978
- you sure?
- You cannot be a lifeguard.

188
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:05,383
You're not going to have
your high school job. You have
a college degree, and you're 30.

189
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,886
I'm 29.

190
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:10,221
Todd, I'm 29.
That's a fact.
Hey, hey, hey.

191
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,490
Todd, can I have...
thank you.

192
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:15,293
Can you please not do that?
Come on.

193
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,462
It's one drag, John.
Fine. Okay?

194
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,431
I got a question
for you, Leigh.

195
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:23,067
You think these guys
are gigantic losers...

196
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:24,903
Because they've never
left ridgefield?

197
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:27,272
I mean, I don't think that.
I'm just asking, you know...

198
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:29,808
- that's a really judgmental question.
- yeah.

199
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,544
Well, Leigh's cosmopolitan
now, and she understands
this kind of thing.

200
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:35,180
- What do you think?
- definitely. Absolutely.

201
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:37,515
- See?
- honestly, I do.

202
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:39,984
It's a sweet job.

203
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,253
You do nothing.
<i>You </i>do nothing.

204
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:45,356
But in my field of expertise.

205
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,859
Do you remember that red
one-piece bathing suit
she used to wear?

206
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:50,295
- She looked like
a swiss army knife.
- you guys could come visit!

207
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,230
- Are you having a nervous breakdown, Leigh?
- John.

208
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:56,568
- What?
- what? I'm kidding.
Jesus.

209
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:08,913
Is this parking lot
passed down in the DN.A.
Of skaters?

210
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:11,549
Like a geese migratory path?

211
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:14,285
- Look at us.
- that's true. John.

212
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,421
Yes?
You don't know this,
but...

213
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,590
This parking lot,
this very place...

214
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:23,228
it was like the beating heart
of our high school social life.
This was it.

215
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,396
We used to come here
every night.

216
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,966
Then we'd try and think
of what we were gonna do
that night.

217
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:30,034
But really we would just
end up standing around
the parking lot.

218
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,503
Oh, yeah?
Like making out and stuff?

219
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:34,873
- More than that.
- - I'm sure.

220
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,408
I'm pretty sure
I opened the back hatch
of someone's...

221
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,344
No, no, no, no, no.
of someone's...

222
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:39,344
We're not talking about that.

223
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:43,548
I'm sorry that I brought it up.
Who was it in the back?

224
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,216
- Come on, please.
- stop it.

225
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,918
Can you not...
stop it.

226
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,887
Well, despite our elderliness,

227
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:52,457
some things remain
from our youth.

228
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:54,158
No.

229
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,361
I get up so early.
It's torture.
Me too.

230
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,496
I have to go.
I'm asleep right now.

231
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,166
Good night.

232
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:03,968
Just...

233
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,570
no, don't go.

234
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,487
Shit.

235
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:24,389
I'm coming.
I'm coming.

236
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,929
It's probably the same shit
as before.

237
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,064
I wasn't here in 2000,
so I don't know.

238
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:36,000
You've gotta log
the pressure in these tanks
every day.

239
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:38,636
They drop below 10
or above 30,
you gotta let me know.

240
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,939
I remember.
The ritual.

241
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:46,511
I usually cut the grass
about once a week,
every 10 days.

242
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:50,949
When it gets really high,
I try to keep it
out of the pool.

243
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:55,186
You got the hook over there.

244
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,561
Got new chairs.

245
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,032
All right then.

246
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:11,469
Here are the keys.
I'm usually around
unless I'm not.

247
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,638
Don't skimp on the cleaning.

248
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,406
I will not.

249
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,108
Okay.

250
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,078
Hello.

251
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,115
Hi.

252
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,778
Hey.

253
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,546
I'm Little Jason.

254
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,748
My dad's Big Jason,
head of maintenance.

255
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,517
Leigh.

256
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,585
New lifeguard.
Yep.

257
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,492
I... I live right there.

258
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:43,494
Apartment in the garage.

259
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,297
Oh.

260
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:49,067
Oh. Yeah.

261
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,722
See ya.

262
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,209


263
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,749
Hey.

264
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,418
Hi.

265
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,259
No running.

266
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,462
Hey!

267
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,131
No running!

268
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,475
What are you doing in here?

269
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,413
Stop! Oh, my god!
Stop it!

270
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,782
Fuck you, you fucking bitch!

271
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,851
Suck my dick.

272
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,686
Excuse me?

273
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:19,290
You need to
leave the pool, now.
Get out.

274
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:22,660
- No, bitch. Suck it.
- get out! Out! Out!

275
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,629
Right now! Get out!

276
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,234
No running!
Fuck you!

277
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:31,836
You're fucking ugly!

278
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,539
Get out, now!

279
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,821
Leigh.

280
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:53,191
Small Jason.
How you doin'?

281
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,659
Fine.

282
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,796
Can I have a cigarette?

283
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,650
Do you know the kids
who live here?

284
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,385
Some of 'em.

285
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,621
Do you know one
who's about 10...

286
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:27,358
But he looks like
a 1930s italian gangster...

287
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,493
Except shrunk into a miniature,

288
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:31,796
and he's really obnoxious
like he has no mother?

289
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,632
Aaron.

290
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,534
He has a mom.

291
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:41,739
She's fat... to, like,
the point of not moving.

292
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,709
Why?
He can't come to the pool
anymore. He's banned.

293
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,478
Why?

294
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,549
Because he wouldn't listen,

295
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:54,752
and he and his friends
swore at me,

296
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,754
and they wouldn't listen.

297
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,791
And I'm not...

298
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:03,327
I'm not invisible.

299
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:05,896
I'm the fuckin' lifeguard,
motherfucker.

300
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,805
And some cunt just sat
over there in her chair,

301
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:17,975
flipping through her magazine
like I didn't even
need her help.

302
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:19,944
Oh, shit.
Whoa.

303
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,547
Well, she was.

304
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,718
I'm not a babysitter.

305
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,854
I'm not here to be screamed at.

306
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:32,823
You gonna quit?

307
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:35,993
I don't want to.

308
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:37,995
I really don't, but...

309
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,305
thought you were supposed
to be healthy, lifeguard.

310
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:51,942
I'm just supposed to
make sure you don't die.

311
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,317
You're talking about
middle schoolers?

312
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,552
There were four of them.

313
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:05,323
Leigh, were they standing
on each other's shoulders,
or how did this...

314
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:08,592
I told Mel
we'd pick her up later.

315
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:11,329
Do we have reservations?
For what?

316
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:14,498
Let's just, you know,
do whatever.

317
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,934
You don't even have to come.

318
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:19,670
Really. It might not even
be fun for you.

319
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:23,007
If you don't want me to come,
just say so, okay?

320
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:28,012
Maybe stay home?
Is that okay?

321
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,514
I just want to
get it out of her...
you know, what she's doing.

322
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,417
And then I'll come home
and tell you everything.

323
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:36,120
Yeah.
I really don't care.

324
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:38,923
You don't... Care?

325
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,628
You can't drink though.

326
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:48,999
One glass of red wine
is... Fine.

327
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:51,869
Honestly. How else would
french women get pregnant?

328
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,839
Oh, okay. Yeah.

329
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:56,574
Whatever, Mel.

330
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:03,581
Asshole.

331
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:08,486
Hey.
Mmm. Jesus.

332
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:10,955
Hi. So...

333
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,825
lifeguard.

334
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:16,560
Yeah?

335
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,096
Can you buy us beer?

336
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:22,433
Please?
Yeah. Lumpy's brother
was supposed to,

337
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:26,003
but circumstances intervened.

338
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:28,072
No.
Why?

339
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:30,741
I mean, because
we have lives...

340
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:34,879
That don't need
to be interrupted
by the long arm of the law.

341
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:36,714
What would we get out of it?

342
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,150
I don't know.

343
00:23:39,152 --> 00:23:41,051
I think you do.

344
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:46,991
What is valuable
to someone looking
to broaden his mind?

345
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:50,161
Something you could
perhaps purchase.
It grows in nature.

346
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,565
Oh.

347
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,867
A moment, please,
while we conference.

348
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,438
What about Mel?

349
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,973
I don't know, lifeguard.
What about Mel?

350
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,544
No. No, no, no.
Excuse me.

351
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:10,047
You didn't say anything
about getting weed from
my 16-year-old students.

352
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,749
They look older.

353
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:14,018
Yeah. No.
We should go then.

354
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,753
Hey. No. No.

355
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:17,988
If you're so worried,
then don't do it.

356
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:22,726
Oh, that's so much fun.
I'm so glad that I left
my car at home.

357
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:25,095
Then do it.
They'll think
you're awesome.

358
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:29,700
Keep your voice down.
No. This is not...
I could get fired.

359
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:32,670
'Sup?
Vice principal
smith-lentz.

360
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:38,509
Hi, boys.
Um... all right.

361
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:41,011
Let's talk about this,
because this is potentially...

362
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:44,515
Very confusing, I think,
for everyone.

363
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:48,519
I came here with these people
not knowing what they
were intending to do...

364
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:51,689
Or with whom...

365
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:54,692
Or... What.

366
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:57,895
I don't care
if you smoke weed
with us...

367
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,632
Because I'm droppin' out.

368
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:03,968
Yeah, me too.
Yeah, I don't
give a shit.

369
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,870
Are you insane?

370
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:08,239
Do... do you actually
want to face this cold,
harsh world...

371
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:10,508
Without a high school diploma?

372
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,776
Why don't you
just blind yourself
while you're at it?

373
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:16,046
No.
I hate it here.

374
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:17,715
We're moving to Vermont.

375
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:19,984
Vermont?
yeah.

376
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:22,253
I definitely am.
My sister's up there.

377
00:25:22,255 --> 00:25:26,056
Yeah, my mom's there
with my stepdad,
like an hour away.

378
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,659
It's way better than here.

379
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:30,761
You heard what they said.

380
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:33,797
They're not
your students, so...

381
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,299
shall we?
Todd?

382
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:37,902
Great.
No. This is wrong.

383
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:39,937
To you, it is, Mel.

384
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:42,239
Not to the rest of us.

385
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:44,675
Oh, wow. This is...
now you see what
I have to put up with.

386
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,677
Mm-hmm. But...

387
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,979
I... hey. Hey.

388
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:52,249
No, I do not approve of this!

389
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:03,594
You went to RH.S. Too?

390
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:05,729
Yeah.

391
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:09,600
Um, Leigh was actually
valedictorian.

392
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,870
What were you?

393
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:15,306
Um, I...

394
00:26:15,308 --> 00:26:17,975
well...

395
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:22,313
leonard, it actually took me
until after high school...

396
00:26:22,315 --> 00:26:24,915
To really focus.

397
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,584
Really?

398
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,353
Oh, yeah.

399
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,328
Do not share this location
with anyone unworthy.

400
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:43,601
Does the old lady have,
like, a fuckin' shotgun
for trespassers?

401
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:45,703
She doesn't have a shotgun.

402
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:49,707
But if I find out any
of your friends came here...

403
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:52,776
And desecrated a tiger lily...

404
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,878
Or littered,
I <i>will </i> have a shotgun.

405
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:58,882
That's cool.

406
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,723
What?
Don't be an idiot.

407
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:07,825
Just...

408
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:10,361
I wish I could
impress that upon you.

409
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:15,899
Okay.

410
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:18,669
I know you think
this town is bad...

411
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:20,771
And, you know,
you need to leave,

412
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:24,675
but I don't think
you realize how privileged
this experience is.

413
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,314
How's it privileged?

414
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:38,789
Nature, for one.

415
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,726
Excellent public school
education,

416
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:45,162
for two.

417
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:50,367
It's safe.
You're sheltered... which
you never will be again.

418
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:54,004
Well, me and him
get arrested one more time,

419
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,707
we're tried as adults.

420
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:59,143
My classes suck, so...

421
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:01,178
well, stop doing
dumb shit, "a."

422
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,747
And "b,"
Your classes don't suck.

423
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,716
I'm in special ed.

424
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:10,354
I have AD.D., so...

425
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,094
what?

426
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:22,066
Having AD.D. Does not mean
you should be in special ed.

427
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,035
Thanks.

428
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,905
I know.

429
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,381
Orion's belt.

430
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,420
Big dipper.

431
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:49,326
Mmm... Seven sisters.

432
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,005
You're 16.
You have your whole life
ahead of you.

433
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,344
You have no idea
how lucky you are right now.

434
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,127
Thank you for driving.

435
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:26,497
That was...
Probably unfortunate.

436
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,505
Fuck you guys.

437
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:41,078
- What?
- I really needed
to have fun tonight.

438
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,880
And you didn't even care.

439
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:45,549
And you don't even...

440
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:48,952
you never ask
how I am or...

441
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:52,122
Mel, what's... what's wrong?

442
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:57,561
It's just really hard,
trying to get pregnant.

443
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,933
I... I think
that's normal, right?

444
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,304
Isn't your life perfect?

445
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,140
No!

446
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,809
Oh!

447
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:15,579
Hey. Hey.

448
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:29,193
I read somewhere
they did a study
of children in jamaica...

449
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:31,495
Whose mothers smoked weed
during utero,

450
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:35,532
and they were actually
happier and more creative
than other children.

451
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:37,534
I believe that.
Absolutely.

452
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:40,137
Absolutely.
Mm-hmm.

453
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:44,241
"Remember to not
be too nostalgic
for this time.

454
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:47,244
Our lives
are what lay ahead...

455
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:50,948
In this uncharted territory
of our dreams.

456
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,516
Aw.

457
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:55,552
Be brave and bold...

458
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,489
And do not look back,
classmates,

459
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:02,326
for the future
is meant to be seized...

460
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:04,862
With both hands."
Both hands.

461
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,964
Oh. So embarrassing.

462
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:11,935
Both hands.
Both hands.

463
00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:14,004
Really?
It's that funny?
Yeah.

464
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:17,875
Leigh London, valedictorian...

465
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:20,644
And virgin?

466
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:23,480
- Yes. See?
- What did I know?

467
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:26,516
Absolutely nothing.
Mm-hmm.

468
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:29,620
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

469
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:31,922
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

470
00:31:31,924 --> 00:31:33,991
Hi.

471
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,894
Right.

472
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:40,364
I don't want to drive.

473
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:42,366
Tell him
you're too tired.
I'm very tired.

474
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,503
I'm tired!

475
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:48,538
Because I've had a long week.

476
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,042
No. John, I'm just tired.

477
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:56,680
Okay.

478
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:59,049
All right.
See you tomorrow.

479
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:01,318
Hey. I love you.

480
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:11,328
I'm sleeping over.
Yes!

481
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,497
I will prepare us cereal.

482
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,475
I'm so jealous of you.

483
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,713
Me? Why?

484
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,483
Because you get to be lost.

485
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,572
It's okay.
Hey.

486
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,645
I thought you lived
in fox crest.

487
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,248
Yeah.

488
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,752
And you were too fucked up
to walk the 20 yards
back to your bed?

489
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,655
My mom kicked me out.

490
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,657
Because you were fucked up.

491
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,766
I'm gonna go puke.

492
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,992
Here.

493
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:48,525
Better be careful, man.
You pass out like that in
Vermont, you froze in the snow.

494
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,460
Ah, the myth of Vermont.

495
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:52,262
Myth?

496
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:54,297
Shee-at.
It's on the map.

497
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:00,037
Next week.
Well, that's just not
gonna happen, man.

498
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:02,172
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know. I know.

499
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:06,343
But that's why I'm trying
to have a conversation with you
about cap rates. Right.

500
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:09,713
Exactly. Yes.
Well, that's why
I hired you.

501
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:12,816
Don't be an asshole about it.
No, we don't trust bankers.

502
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,152
We do not trust bankers.
Okay?

503
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:26,830
We got this guy.
When he starts to push back,
that's what you do.

504
00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:29,299
It's sort of like...
right. Yeah.

505
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:32,302
This is a, uh...
this is a chuck e. Cheese
we're talking about.

506
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:34,571
Obviously,
don't use that language...

507
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,540
but you know what I mean.

508
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:41,411
<i>Let Me Take You</i>
<i>To the outside place</i>

509
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,814


510
00:34:43,816 --> 00:34:46,083
Whoo!

511
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:48,351
<i>Whoo! Whoo!</i>

512
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:50,821
<i>Let Me Take You</i>
<i>To the outside place</i>

513
00:34:50,823 --> 00:34:52,789
Oww!

514
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:57,260
<i>- Oh, Do You Wanna Go</i>
<i>- again! Again! Again!</i>

515
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,096
<i>To The Place Where you belong?</i>

516
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:03,200
- <i> Oh, Do You Wanna G</i>
<i>- oww!</i>

517
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:05,535
<i>To The Place Where you belong?</i>

518
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:08,605
<i>Do You Wanna Go?</i>

519
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:11,608
Most people
get better with age
with driving.

520
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,643
He's actually
gotten worse.
I don't think that's...

521
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:16,746
no, because you started out
as a fairly good driver.

522
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:20,183
It was intentional
bad driving.
Was it? It was intentional?

523
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:21,818
Yes.

524
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:30,160
Leigh?
Give me a m...

525
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:32,562
number one,
you got a nice

526
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:34,865
Number two,
you have no respect for...

527
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:36,666
hey.
Leigh London.

528
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:39,603
How you doin'?
Hi, rick.
How are ya?

529
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:44,341
Listen, I know these guys.
Can I help at all
in this situation?

530
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:46,576
No.
This is police business.

531
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:49,679
- They're skating.
- and someone complained?

532
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:52,916
Or... is there
an ordinance against it?
I didn't think there was.

533
00:35:52,918 --> 00:35:56,153
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to
ask you to go away now.

534
00:35:56,155 --> 00:36:00,323
Unless you have
a valid reason to be cornering
these underage youths,

535
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,792
what you're doing right now
is called harassment.

536
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:05,495
Maybe I should take you downtown
for impeding an arrest.

537
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,864
Am I impeding an arrest?

538
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:11,268
If you have a reason
to arrest them
and you can prove it,

539
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,436
then, I mean,
by all means take me down,

540
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:15,906
'cause I...
I will understand.

541
00:36:15,908 --> 00:36:17,674
No more skating.

542
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,376
But why, rick?

543
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:21,545
You're a real piece of work.

544
00:36:21,547 --> 00:36:23,713
You're kind of a bitch,
actually.

545
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:26,349
I'm sorry.
What was that, Officer?

546
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:29,686
You know I'm a reporter
for the associated press, right?

547
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:34,824
Fuckin' nuts.

548
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,232
So you're
just gonna take some
time off and then, uh...

549
00:36:42,234 --> 00:36:45,435
I mean, what,
are you thinking of
a career change, or, uh...

550
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:47,737
Uh, I don't know.

551
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:50,874
Okay, well, are you gonna
look for something else
around here?

552
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,443
Or were you gonna
go back to the city
once the pool closes?

553
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,845
- I have no idea.
- okay.

554
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:57,814
That's... Good.
Good.

555
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:01,918
Ah, no.
No, thanks.
I will pass on that.

556
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,987
Uh, Leigh, evidently, will not.

557
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:07,757
Can you just keep...
Drinking your beer?
Yeah.

558
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:10,527
Let's try and have fun.
I know that it's weird,
whatever.

559
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:12,729
But... Let's just try
and have a good time.

560
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:15,232
Okay.

561
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:17,867
I can't believe
it's not developed yet.

562
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:19,536
It's a park, John.

563
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:21,805
Nature.
It's "pra-served."

564
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:23,907
We used to come
when we were little.

565
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:26,810
Remember Leigh had
all these plans about getting
married under the arbor?

566
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:28,912
I'm thinking
it's water table issues.

567
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:31,714
Otherwise the city
would've developed the shit
out of this place by now.

568
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:35,518
What does this
remind me of, Mel?

569
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,654
It's like, uh,
<i>great expectations.</i>
<i>Right?</i>

570
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:42,425
Remember that?
It's all overgrown
and old and everything.

571
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,263
No way.

572
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:49,432
This is a piece
of chandelier.
This is a crystal.

573
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,268
It's original.
I just found it.
Bullshit.

574
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,404
That's probably a hypodermic
needle. Let me see it.
No!

575
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:58,275
'Cause better classes now
at, you know, a better college.

576
00:37:58,277 --> 00:38:00,343
I don't wanna go to college.

577
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:02,779
Okay.
What do you want?

578
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,715
I don't know.
Something cool.

579
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,984
Something...
Outside.

580
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,988
Wh-what does that mea...

581
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:15,558
You have to be specific.
You can't just drift.

582
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:22,432
What?

583
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:27,070
You seem really sad.

584
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:52,662
Well, it's just Leigh
never seemed like the kind
of person that would be lost.

585
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:54,431
You know?

586
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:55,965
Me, on the other hand...

587
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:59,336
yeah, well, you know,
real life can be
disappointing...

588
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:01,471
When your expectations
are so high.

589
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:06,476
I have high expectations.

590
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:09,913
You know what
I'm talking about.

591
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:11,748
Everybody does.

592
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:16,953
Well, whatever.

593
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:18,956
Excuse me.

594
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:26,963
I'm not gonna hang out
with those kids anymore. Okay?

595
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:28,665
Why not?

596
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:31,101
We didn't smoke weed.

597
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:33,036
Seriously, Mel?

598
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,971
I mean...

599
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:36,973
Leigh is being a fucking idiot.
Okay?

600
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:39,709
I mean, Todd wants to,
like, rape those kids.

601
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,511
Hey. Hey.

602
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:43,480
You can't say that.

603
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:49,619
Look, I just wanna
hang out with adults.
Okay?

604
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:51,421
Is that too much to ask?

605
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:53,890
Great.

606
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:56,393
"Great"?

607
00:39:56,395 --> 00:39:59,095
Fine!
Fine. It's fine.

608
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,557
What are you doing?

609
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,697
Slap my face...

610
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:36,566
With your dick.

611
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:51,815
Wh...
what's wrong with you?

612
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:59,222
Hey. Hey.

613
00:40:59,224 --> 00:41:01,724
Hey, hey, hey, baby.
Hey.

614
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:03,460
I love you.

615
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:05,595
Okay?
I love you.

616
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,064
Hey.

617
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:10,767
It's okay.

618
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,894
I did a story about a guy
who kept a tiger
in his apartment...

619
00:41:37,896 --> 00:41:40,230
In the city.

620
00:41:40,232 --> 00:41:42,632
The tiger got sick and died.

621
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:47,070
Well, that'd be cool. Right?

622
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:49,839
To have a tiger as a pet.

623
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,942
And fuckin' invite
everybody you hate
to the house.

624
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,648
What?

625
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,685
What?

626
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,687
It's not cool.

627
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:06,189
It's sad.

628
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:08,057
It's incredibly sad.

629
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,996
This creature was kept...

630
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:14,898
Against its will...

631
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,834
In a totally unnatural
environment for it.

632
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:21,304
And it was kept
in, like, a cell...

633
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:22,939
In someone's apartment...

634
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:24,607
For their amusement.

635
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,646
But it was cruel,
and it killed it.

636
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:33,950
Someone took
this amazing thing that...

637
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,287
that should have been
running free...

638
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:39,656
And kept it prisoner.

639
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:45,094
And it died.

640
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:49,332
And it was just...

641
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:53,636
it wasn't even full grown.

642
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:58,174
Well, maybe,

643
00:42:58,176 --> 00:43:00,743
'cause you wrote the article,

644
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:02,245
you know...

645
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:06,583
um, I-if somebody
had an animal...

646
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:10,787
And they weren't
treating it right,

647
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:14,324
they would read
your article and...
and... Change their minds.

648
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:20,063
Yeah.

649
00:43:20,065 --> 00:43:21,798
Maybe.

650
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:34,143
Oh.

651
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:36,079
Ohh!

652
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:51,394
Lifeguard?

653
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:53,896
Please don't ban me
from the pool.

654
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,370
You didn't listen.

655
00:44:00,372 --> 00:44:03,673
You were behaving
in a way that was dangerous
to everyone.

656
00:44:03,675 --> 00:44:05,408
Please!

657
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:08,144
I'm sorry!

658
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,980
You disobey
lifeguard's orders again,

659
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,383
and that's it...
you're out for good.

660
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,886
But you can come back.

661
00:44:16,888 --> 00:44:18,354
Yes.

662
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:22,091
Well, um, lifeguard?

663
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:24,894
Can you tell
Little Jason and those guys
to leave me alone?

664
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:26,929
'Cause I said sorry to you now.

665
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:32,902
Okay.

666
00:45:03,001 --> 00:45:04,801
What the fuck!

667
00:45:04,803 --> 00:45:07,070
You fucking scared me.

668
00:45:07,072 --> 00:45:08,838
It's raining.

669
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,908
So?

670
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:15,945
I recognized your car.

671
00:45:15,947 --> 00:45:17,947
I should lock my doors.

672
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:19,982
No.

673
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,503
Where are
your no-good friends?

674
00:45:40,505 --> 00:45:42,338
I don't know.

Um...

679
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,243
You didn't bring an umbrella?

680
00:46:20,245 --> 00:46:21,978
I didn't know
this would happen!
Hey.

681
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,888
Forgot your keys.
Thanks.

682
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:39,996
What's up?
What's goin' on,
man?

683
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:50,173
There we go.

<i>We're All The Same</i>

705
00:48:16,361 --> 00:48:18,895
Yes. Take it down.

<i>Well, Maybe I Should Chae</i>
<i>My point of view</i>

716
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:16,719
Leigh, what is wrong with you?

717
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:19,021
What?

718
00:49:19,023 --> 00:49:20,489
Nothing.

719
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:22,224
Just because
you're staying here...

720
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:28,331
Doesn't mean you can take
advantage of your father and I
and pretend this is a hotel.

721
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:30,366
You came in
at 3:00 in the morning.

722
00:49:30,368 --> 00:49:32,301
I was worried.
I didn't know where you were.

723
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,105
Sorry.
I lost track of time.

724
00:49:36,107 --> 00:49:39,241
Just do a couple of dishes
once in a while.
Pick up after yourself.

725
00:49:39,243 --> 00:49:41,043
Huh?

726
00:49:41,045 --> 00:49:44,313
Your father's out.
I need to get out of here too.

727
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:47,149
You need a ride to work,
you got to get going now.

728
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:50,987
I don't... I don't need a ride.
I'm not working
till the afternoon.

729
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,364
Good morning.

730
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:06,235
Hans, what are you doing here?

731
00:50:06,237 --> 00:50:10,172
Leigh's got the morning off,
so I thought we'd make
granola bars like the old days.

732
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:13,009
Yes!
Please tell me
this isn't happening.

733
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:15,411
You're supposed
to be in hartford.

734
00:50:15,413 --> 00:50:17,146
What?

735
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:20,182
Picking up my banners
for the trade show.

736
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:21,684
You told me
that you would do it...

737
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:24,520
Because today I have to do
the yoga workshop, Hans.

738
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:27,423
I'm so sorry, justine.
I forgot. Shoot.

739
00:50:27,425 --> 00:50:29,658
I saw Leigh's schedule
on the fridge,

740
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:32,294
so I thought this
would be a good morning
for us to do this.

741
00:50:32,296 --> 00:50:33,796
Oh, and you didn't happen
to see the directions...

742
00:50:33,798 --> 00:50:36,365
That are right there
to the printer?
No.

743
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,134
What kind of a trade show is it?

744
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:42,138
It's a health
and fitness trade show...

745
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:44,340
To get out the word
on dance mamas.

746
00:50:44,342 --> 00:50:46,042
Uh...

747
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:51,580
I'm sorry.
It's just the name, mom.
It's... it's just the name.

748
00:50:51,582 --> 00:50:54,183
Justine, I'm sorry.
I forgot, okay?

749
00:50:54,185 --> 00:50:56,385
Sweetie? Justine.

750
00:50:59,524 --> 00:51:01,424
- Shoot.
- yikes.

751
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,762
We got all morning.

752
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,700
Sorry. I...

753
00:52:17,702 --> 00:52:20,636
I'm s... sorry.

754
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:16,759
In the summers,
when I was really little,

755
00:53:16,761 --> 00:53:20,563
we'd go up
to my mom's friend's,
up in Vermont.

756
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,733
He had, like,
a... Cabin.

757
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:28,771
So small, on a lake.

758
00:53:28,773 --> 00:53:31,273
You'd have to shower
in the lake.

759
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:34,310
We'd catch sunfish.

760
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,880
And, you know,
they were just...

761
00:53:39,482 --> 00:53:42,318
people usually throw 'em back.

762
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,453
But we'd cook 'em on the fire.

763
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,224
They were the best.

764
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:10,779
You can bite.

765
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:15,618
Be careful.
We don't want you
getting hurt.

766
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:18,754
<i>I Was Out</i>
<i>Paying close attention</i>

767

<i>The Way Our chemicals collid</i>

773
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,688
Slower.

<i>I Was Out</i>
<i>Catching up to tomorrow</i>

775
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:01,597

00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:46,508
Think we're gonna move soon.

783
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:50,079
School's gonna start.

784
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:53,649
Gotta get a move on.

785
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:56,585
Soon when?

786
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,823
Few days.

787
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:05,027
Do you actually
have money saved?

788
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:10,799
I have, like, 400
from helping my dad
around here.

789
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:16,739
Jay, you need
at least a thousand.

790
00:56:16,741 --> 00:56:18,907
At least.

791
00:56:18,909 --> 00:56:21,910
You don't know
how long it's gonna take you
to get work up there.

792
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:30,552
Why don't you just take
a few more weeks...

793
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:33,489
And work hard with your dad...

794
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:35,657
And...

795
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:37,726
Just hang out?

796
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:51,673

That I can't know about.

807
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:07,749
What?
I would have to tell.

808
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,921
You're stoned.

809
00:58:12,923 --> 00:58:14,623

When are you leaving?
Okay.

814
00:58:26,804 --> 00:58:28,804
A week.

815
00:58:28,806 --> 00:58:31,940
Excuse me.

816
00:58:31,942 --> 00:58:34,776
They're leaving in a week?

817
00:58:34,778 --> 00:58:37,145
What?
It's time.

818
00:58:37,147 --> 00:58:40,549
If you want a change,

819
00:58:40,551 --> 00:58:43,218
then, uh, try
picking up a hobby.

820
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:46,021
Yeah. Guys, I... I really...
I wanna talk about this.

821
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:48,724
I think we can even
bring guidance in to...
no.

822
00:58:48,726 --> 00:58:51,293
No. No.

823
00:58:51,295 --> 00:58:55,097
I'm not staying
in this fucking town
with these asshole people.

824
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:57,065
Okay?

825
00:58:57,067 --> 00:59:00,669
There's, like,
a world out there
outside of this town.

826
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:02,671
The world is full of assholes.

827
00:59:02,673 --> 00:59:04,973
At least we're
the assholes
that you know.

828
00:59:04,975 --> 00:59:07,576
You need a drink?
Let's get you a drink.

829
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,178
I'll come.

830
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:15,217
Oh. Do you have
a lighter?

831
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:25,694
Thanks.

832
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,699
Are you okay?

833
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,970
No. I hate it here.

834
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:37,839
I hate my life.

835
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:41,777
I did too.

836
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,280
I did too.

837
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:50,352
But, like,
why don't you leave, man?

838
00:59:50,354 --> 00:59:53,655
I mean, like,
you actually could,
like, go to New York city.

839
00:59:55,858 --> 00:59:57,960
'Cause I can't.

840
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:04,299
And my parents are here,
you know.

841
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:06,702
Family, friends.

842
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:10,038
People know me.

843
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,808
Once I leave, everything...

844
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:15,811
Would be very, very different.

845
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:24,353
You know how my brother died?

846
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:28,357
Oh, yeah.

847
01:00:28,359 --> 01:00:30,225
Yeah, we were seniors.

848
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:33,095
I remember really well.

849
01:00:33,097 --> 01:00:34,763
Like...

850
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:38,266
he was a fuckup.

851
01:00:38,268 --> 01:00:42,938
I mean, he was such a fuckup.

852
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:44,640
But...

853
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:49,044
I don't know.

854
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:53,115
And, like,

855
01:00:53,117 --> 01:00:57,719
he died, and my mom
can't even stand
the sight of me.

856
01:00:57,721 --> 01:00:59,755
Like, for real.

857
01:00:59,757 --> 01:01:02,958
I see it on her face
every time I walk in the room.

858
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,028
So...

859
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:13,402
I'm sorry.

860
01:01:13,404 --> 01:01:15,704
That's terrible.

861
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:17,305
That's terrible.

862
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:26,314
What the fuck, dude?

863
01:01:26,316 --> 01:01:28,283
I'm not gay.

864
01:01:29,218 --> 01:01:31,420
No, but you're very cute.

865
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:36,158
What is wrong with you?

866
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,927
I was trying
to fucking talk to you.

867
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:44,933
Look, I was... I was...
we were talking.
I'm sorry.

868
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:47,302
I was talking to you.

869
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:50,238
Sorry.

870
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:55,143
What the fuck, Matt?
Let's go tomorrow.

871
01:01:55,145 --> 01:01:58,413
Why? I thought we said,
like, in a week or whatever.

872
01:01:58,415 --> 01:02:01,049
I need to get out of here.

873
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:03,885
I need to get the fuck
out of this town.

874
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:07,723
Are you coming or not?
Yeah. Yeah.

875
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:10,392
Okay.
But not, like, tomorrow.

876
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:13,028
I mean, dude,
I need some time
to get some money.

877
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:15,130
I don't wanna just go
up there with nothing.

878
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:18,200
How much time do you need?

879
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:23,271
I don't know.

880
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:26,007
But not now.

881
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:32,380
Okay.

882
01:02:52,034 --> 01:03:00,142
<i>I Have Seen You</i>
<i>In various stages of undress</i>

883
01:03:00,144 --> 01:03:06,148
<i>I Have Seen You Through</i>
<i>Various states of madnes</i>

884
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,886
<i>I Have Seen Your refractions</i>

885
01:03:10,888 --> 01:03:15,824
<i>And I Did Not Recognize you</i>

886
01:03:15,826 --> 01:03:22,063
<i>I Have Seen You</i>
<i>In various states of madness</i>

887
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:30,906
<i>How High</i>

888
01:03:30,908 --> 01:03:33,341
<i>Your Highest Of Heights?</i>

889
01:03:33,343 --> 01:03:35,544
<i>How Low Are Your Lows?</i>

890
01:03:35,546 --> 01:03:38,814
<i>How High</i>

891
01:03:38,816 --> 01:03:41,149
<i>Your Highest Of Heights?</i>

892
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:44,186
<i>How Low Are Your Lows?</i>

893
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:53,261
Um, 2003,
I think...

894
01:03:53,263 --> 01:03:54,930
I wanna say.

895
01:03:54,932 --> 01:03:57,165
So yeah, like nine years.

896
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:04,039
Shit, my dad could do this
in, like, two months.

897
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:06,875
They want to do it themselves.

898
01:04:06,877 --> 01:04:09,077
It's like a...

899
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:10,946
Midlife thing,

900
01:04:10,948 --> 01:04:15,951
like a... "Do something
with my hands" thing.

901
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:18,220
Yeah?

902
01:04:18,222 --> 01:04:21,323
Well, they didn't.
I know.

903
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:24,259
I know.

904
01:04:24,261 --> 01:04:25,927
It's so embarrassing.

905
01:04:25,929 --> 01:04:28,230
It's like...
how hard is it...

906
01:04:28,232 --> 01:04:31,600
To just move forward and...

907
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:42,444
Leigh.

908
01:04:42,446 --> 01:04:45,080
Just wanted to make sure
you weren't the raccoons.

909
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:09,471
Oh, no. Are you still up
because of me?

910
01:05:09,473 --> 01:05:13,608
We started that addition
when you went off to college.

911
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:16,211
You know, I made
your dad do it.

912
01:05:16,213 --> 01:05:19,247
I made him go to home depot.

913
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:22,017
I made him do
the plans with me...

914
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:24,319
So we would have...

915
01:05:26,188 --> 01:05:28,223
Something together.

916
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:32,193
You know how that worked out.

917
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:35,230
But it's not funny, Leigh.

918
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:38,466
And it's not yours...

919
01:05:38,468 --> 01:05:41,603
it's not yours
to be embarrassed about.

920
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:43,471
I...

921
01:05:43,473 --> 01:05:46,174
I need you to move out. Now.

922
01:05:46,176 --> 01:05:47,976
Are you serious?

923
01:05:47,978 --> 01:05:51,046
Mom, I'm sorry
that I was snarky
about the addition...

924
01:05:51,048 --> 01:05:53,214
has it ever occurred to you...

925
01:05:53,216 --> 01:05:55,650
That I might be working
on <i>my </i> life?

926
01:05:55,652 --> 01:05:57,419
Hmm?

927
01:05:57,421 --> 01:05:59,554
We both can't be doing that
at the same time?

928
01:05:59,556 --> 01:06:01,656
Oh, is that what you're doing?

929
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:06,161
Yes.

930
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:09,397
You know, I'm al...

931
01:06:09,399 --> 01:06:13,335
I'm allowed
to, um, be confused...

932
01:06:13,337 --> 01:06:16,171
And stumble once in a while.

933
01:06:16,173 --> 01:06:19,474
Okay? I've never done that
up until this point.
Okay? Never.

934
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:22,477
Let me tell you something.
I've always been 100%...

935
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,746
your father
would be so happy...

936
01:06:24,748 --> 01:06:29,117
To keep you as a baby forever.

937
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:31,252
But it's different
for the mother.

938
01:06:31,254 --> 01:06:36,024
Now, I know you don't know
what that means yet, but...

939
01:06:36,026 --> 01:06:40,195
you know that you were
the solar eclipse of my life?

940
01:06:40,197 --> 01:06:42,063
That's what I wanted.

941
01:06:42,065 --> 01:06:45,066
I hung on your every breath...

942
01:06:45,068 --> 01:06:47,369
Until...
well, until recently,

943
01:06:47,371 --> 01:06:50,138
and I... I just can't...
I'm not...

944
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:53,074
I can't go back
in time with you.

945
01:06:53,076 --> 01:06:55,477
I'm not asking you to.
You have to go.

946
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,256
No, no, no. No.

947
01:07:08,258 --> 01:07:10,592
Sweetheart, I'll talk to mom,
and we'll smooth this out. Okay?

948
01:07:10,594 --> 01:07:12,260
You can't, dad.

949
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:19,334
Leigh?
I'm leaving now.

950
01:07:20,236 --> 01:07:22,670
Moose! Moose!

951
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:39,054
Hi.

952
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:44,192
Can we come in?

953
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:48,389
Hey.

954
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:53,328
So, Matt went to Vermont.

955
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:54,863
Already?

956
01:08:54,865 --> 01:08:56,531
I think so.

957
01:08:58,334 --> 01:08:59,834
His car's gone.

958
01:08:59,836 --> 01:09:02,770
His mom said
he left yesterday
at breakfast time...

959
01:09:02,772 --> 01:09:04,672
And hasn't been back.

960
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:08,443
Why did he go without you?

961
01:09:11,714 --> 01:09:16,251
At the fields,
I told him I wanted
more time.

962
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,687
You know, so...
I don't know.

963
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,561
Maybe he's
feeling it out up there.

964
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:30,331
You know?
Getting the jobs
lined up.

965
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:32,600
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.

966
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:50,718
Jay.
Hmm?

967
01:10:09,873 --> 01:10:11,973
Oh, my god.
Sorry.

968
01:10:11,975 --> 01:10:14,309
Hello.

969
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:19,514
News FLASH: Time moves
in one direction.

970
01:10:19,516 --> 01:10:21,616
Okay?
John...

971
01:10:21,618 --> 01:10:23,918
you're-you're not
a kid anymore, Mel, okay?

972
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,789
You are 30 years old.
And we have a plan. Okay?

973
01:10:27,791 --> 01:10:30,491
So you need to stop
dicking around.
I'm not dicking around.

974
01:10:30,493 --> 01:10:32,627
Oh, yeah, right.
I'm just being free. I'm...

975
01:10:32,629 --> 01:10:34,896
what, um... what?
You're-you're being what?

976
01:10:34,898 --> 01:10:37,865
You're being free?
I'm sor...
I'm being... Carefree.

977
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:40,435
Oh, yeah.
And it's normal.

978
01:10:40,437 --> 01:10:42,503
It's normal, John...
people this age.

979
01:10:42,505 --> 01:10:44,572
You feel...
yeah.

980
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:48,009
Nostalgic, I guess,
and you have
a hard time making...

981
01:10:48,011 --> 01:10:49,844
come on. That's
fucking bullshit, okay?

982
01:10:49,846 --> 01:10:51,713
I don't. I'm not. Right?

983
01:10:51,715 --> 01:10:54,782
You know what
this fucking is?
This is Leigh. Okay?

984
01:10:54,784 --> 01:10:58,386
She is scared to death
of her life,
so she comes running home,

985
01:10:58,388 --> 01:11:00,388
and you guys
all start acting
like fucking teenagers.

986
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:02,991
This has nothing
to do with Leigh.
Yes, it does, damn it!

987
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,541
Do you love me?
Yes, of course I love you.

988
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:27,482
Okay, and do you wanna
make a family with me?

989
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:29,817
Yes.

990
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:34,922
Theoretically, I do.

991
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:40,495
Okay.

992
01:11:40,497 --> 01:11:42,497
All right.
Then let's do it.

993
01:11:42,499 --> 01:11:44,432
Right here, right now.

994
01:11:44,434 --> 01:11:47,568
No.

995
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:49,704
Yes.
I'm mad at you!
No!

996
01:11:49,706 --> 01:11:51,739
Listen to me, okay?

997
01:11:51,741 --> 01:11:55,510
I need you to promise me
you're gonna do this, okay?

998
01:11:55,512 --> 01:11:57,345
That the two of us
are gonna do this together,

999
01:11:57,347 --> 01:12:00,415
and-and-and-and you're
not gonna be, you know,
drinking...

1000
01:12:00,417 --> 01:12:02,483
And-and-and-and smoking.

1001
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:04,819
No more doing drugs.
We are gonna move forward...

1002
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:06,788
Like two people,
like two adult people do, okay?

1003
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:08,790
Right now, right here.

1004
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:10,825
I just need
a little bit more time.

1005
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:13,027
No, baby.
I...

1006
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:14,696
please.

1007
01:12:27,543 --> 01:12:29,010
I'm sorry.

1008
01:12:42,558 --> 01:12:44,125
Okay.

1009
01:12:59,976 --> 01:13:01,642
Mm-mmm.

1010
01:13:05,814 --> 01:13:08,049
Oh, shit.

1011
01:13:08,051 --> 01:13:10,485
What?
Leigh's cat...

1012
01:13:10,487 --> 01:13:14,455
Ran away from little jay's.

1013
01:13:14,457 --> 01:13:17,759
Well, obviously,
you can't bring a cat
to a stranger's house.

1014
01:13:17,761 --> 01:13:20,862
They're gonna
freak out.
Well, she's there with him.

1015
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:26,033
What do you mean,
she was there with it?

1016
01:13:26,035 --> 01:13:30,004
She wasn't there
when it happened.
She was probably at the pool.

1017
01:13:30,006 --> 01:13:34,175
She's not...
she's not staying
at Little Jason's.

1018
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:37,545
Todd?

1019
01:13:42,718 --> 01:13:44,852
Todd, don't look at me.
Oh, my god.

1020
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:49,690
You let this happen?

1021
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:52,026
What is wrong with you?

1022
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:58,099
I wish everyone
would stop saying that.

1023
01:13:58,101 --> 01:13:59,834
Oh, my god.

1024
01:13:59,836 --> 01:14:02,637
You've any idea how much
you just hurt me, Mel?

1025
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:05,072
I... I...
I can't even...

1026
01:14:05,074 --> 01:14:07,108
this has nothing to do with me.

1027
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:19,220
What's wrong?

1028
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:24,459
What the fuck?
What is wrong with you?

1029
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:26,794
Hey, no shoving
on the pool deck.

1030
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:28,830
Jason, where's your dad?
I need to speak to him.

1031
01:14:28,832 --> 01:14:31,599
Wait. Wait.
Mel, what... what is going on?
No, Leigh.

1032
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:36,504
Okay... okay, wait.
Just...

1033
01:14:36,506 --> 01:14:37,939
mm-mmm.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait!

1034
01:14:37,941 --> 01:14:40,241
No! You lied to me.
Stop, Mel.

1035
01:14:40,243 --> 01:14:42,743
- I didn't. No, I didn't. I...
- where's your dad?

1036
01:14:42,745 --> 01:14:45,546
Mel, stop.
No. Fuck you for putting me
in this position.

1037
01:14:45,548 --> 01:14:48,816
- Please.
- Leigh, he's a kid!

1038
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:52,119
Why did you have to come home?

1039
01:14:52,121 --> 01:14:54,655
Just come home
and fuck everything up.

1040
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:57,058
I didn't. Everything
was already fucked up.

1041
01:14:57,060 --> 01:14:59,494
And-and-and things
aren't fucked up.

1042
01:14:59,496 --> 01:15:03,264
I'll tell him you've
been hanging out with us
and drinking and stuff.

1043
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:07,134
Oh, my god.

1044
01:15:07,136 --> 01:15:08,769
Oh, my god.

1045
01:15:08,771 --> 01:15:10,872
Mel...
no.

1046
01:15:10,874 --> 01:15:13,975
You know what?
I think that you couldn't
let me have my shit together.

1047
01:15:13,977 --> 01:15:17,578
'Cause that was
always your thing,
and I was the fuckup, so...

1048
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:21,082
- what? That's not true.
That's not true.
- congratulations.
