1
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:48,671
^v^

2
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:07,991
but I believe we can ill afford
to lose men ofyour high character.

3
00:04:08,325 --> 00:04:10,458
And speaking
as a friend...

4
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,459
who's fought side by side
with you for 15 years...

5
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:16,126
I will sorely miss
the unshakable support...

6
00:04:16,492 --> 00:04:18,793
you've given
the Royal Hong Kong Police.

7
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,126
So, on behalf
of all Brits...

8
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:25,160
who have ever carried the shield
in Hong Kong we shall miss you.

9
00:04:25,493 --> 00:04:27,027
We wish you nothing
but happiness...

10
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,727
as you take up your new post
in the United States.

11
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,194
Ladies and gentlemen,
Consul Han.

12
00:04:34,194 --> 00:04:35,461
Thank you, Thomas.

13
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:43,362
You know Thomas is not going
to make this evening easy.

14
00:04:43,495 --> 00:04:44,828
Excuse me.

15
00:04:51,162 --> 00:04:52,729
Commander Griffin...

16
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:55,163
I am pleased to be able
to leave you and Hong Kong...

17
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,496
with a special gift tonight.

18
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,997
Earlier this evening,
Detective lnspector Lee...

19
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,697
and his special task force
have once and for all...

20
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,031
crushed the Juntao
criminal organization...

21
00:05:05,364 --> 00:05:09,698
and reclaimed artifacts from
5,000 years of China's heritage.

22
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:17,698
This is the kind of legacy
I dreamt about.

23
00:05:18,365 --> 00:05:22,366
-Hong Kong forever.
-To Hong Kong forever.

24
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:11,971
Stupid fool! Get out of my way!

25
00:06:12,637 --> 00:06:14,304
Man, are you crazy?

26
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:15,538
Shoot!

27
00:06:23,338 --> 00:06:26,339
-Clive, what's up, man?
-You're late.

28
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:30,272
-I'm late?
-Yeah, you're late.

29
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:33,006
I've been waiting in the back
for over an hour.

30
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:37,006
-I was in the diner.
-Think I would do this shit out front?

31
00:06:37,673 --> 00:06:40,673
-I'm gonna get busted.
-You weren't in the diner.

32
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:46,341
It don't even matter. Let's do this.
What's that, a gun?

33
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,374
Stop it, man.
Let's do it. Come on.

34
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:54,775
-Don't be late again.
-I ain't gonna be late. What we got?

35
00:06:56,108 --> 00:06:58,108
That's tight.
That's beautiful.

36
00:06:58,475 --> 00:07:01,375
-That's nice. What's that?
-That's C4.

37
00:07:03,776 --> 00:07:06,343
-Oh, shit.
-What's the problem?

38
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,276
No problem. I been looking
everything for this shit.

39
00:07:09,343 --> 00:07:11,343
How the hell you find some C4?

40
00:07:11,677 --> 00:07:16,010
The lraqis can't even get this shit.
Where'd you get this from?

41
00:07:16,677 --> 00:07:18,010
It's a hot ticket.

42
00:07:18,344 --> 00:07:20,277
You don't know
how happy you made me.

43
00:07:20,344 --> 00:07:22,344
You got what I want.
Let me get that money.

44
00:07:22,678 --> 00:07:25,611
-Step away from the car.
-Hey, officers.

45
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:28,612
Put your hands above your heads.
Just do it now.

46
00:07:28,712 --> 00:07:31,345
Ain't no problem here.
Why y'all messing with us for?

47
00:07:32,712 --> 00:07:34,945
All right, take it easy, buddy.
You don't wanna do that.

48
00:07:35,046 --> 00:07:38,312
-No, he don't. He's playing.
-No, I ain't playing.

49
00:07:38,446 --> 00:07:40,446
-Yes, he is, officer.
-I'm not playing!

50
00:07:41,446 --> 00:07:44,113
-Drop the gun!
-He's my cousin. We're just talking.

51
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,980
-Get in your car and leave.
-We can't do that.

52
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:49,447
I'Il blow his head
all over the parking lot.

53
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,014
-Go away and buy some doughnuts!
-You made him mad.

54
00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:54,714
Let me talk to him.
All right?

55
00:07:56,014 --> 00:07:59,348
-Don't move!
-Everything's cool now.

56
00:07:59,681 --> 00:08:02,648
He down. The gun's down.
Get back in the car and leave.

57
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,515
-Hands in your head!
-Everything's cool, officer.

58
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:07,315
Do it now!

59
00:08:27,051 --> 00:08:29,051
Didn't I tell you?

60
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,020
Stop it!
I got C4 in the trunk!

61
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:20,189
Clive, guess what, man.

62
00:09:20,856 --> 00:09:23,456
I forgot to tell you.
I'm LAPD.

63
00:09:23,556 --> 00:09:25,190
You under arrest.

64
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,691
Excuse me.

65
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:40,691
-What?
-Telephone. China.

66
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,859
Soo Yung, I love you.
Have a nice day.

67
00:09:46,992 --> 00:09:49,326
Will you be home after school?

68
00:09:51,326 --> 00:09:54,326
I am going to pick you up myself.

69
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,867
-Is there a problem, officer?
-No problem.

70
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,200
Just rush hour.

71
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,772
Security's in place?

72
00:12:05,373 --> 00:12:08,039
You're sure all ofthe exhibits
will be ready by this weekend?

73
00:12:08,373 --> 00:12:11,440
Yes, sir. Your opening remarks
are scheduled for 7:30.

74
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,440
Excuse me, Consul Han.

75
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:18,774
I'm Warren Russ with the FBl.
This is Agent Whitney.

76
00:12:19,774 --> 00:12:22,108
We need to speak with you
in private.

77
00:12:24,441 --> 00:12:25,775
Excuse me.

78
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:35,276
I know this is a difficult time
for you, Consul...

79
00:12:35,376 --> 00:12:37,942
but we'Il get
your daughter back.

80
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:39,776
But will you get her back alive?

81
00:12:40,109 --> 00:12:43,110
We have the best agents
in the world on those streets.

82
00:12:45,443 --> 00:12:47,677
I would like one
of my people to help.

83
00:12:47,777 --> 00:12:51,310
Let me assure you, the FBI
considers this a top priority.

84
00:12:51,444 --> 00:12:53,777
We have plenty of people
on the case.

85
00:12:54,377 --> 00:12:58,611
Mr. Russ, I am not an American.
My daughter is not an American.

86
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:01,311
-I understand that, sir...
-He's already on the plane.

87
00:13:02,312 --> 00:13:06,312
I trust you will treat him with the same
courtesy as you have shown me.

88
00:13:10,846 --> 00:13:12,379
Ten people
jumped out ofthe trunk.

89
00:13:12,513 --> 00:13:15,513
I started handling all ofthem.
Throwing them everywhere.

90
00:13:15,846 --> 00:13:17,380
Ten two stupid cops
came out of nowhere...

91
00:13:17,513 --> 00:13:20,180
messed everything up,
but then I regrouped.

92
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:23,480
It ain't in there.
Anyway, I saved their life.

93
00:13:23,547 --> 00:13:25,547
I start runnin',
trying to get the bomb...

94
00:13:25,881 --> 00:13:29,614
-I can't believe you went without me.
-I'Il talk to y'all later, all right?

95
00:13:29,948 --> 00:13:31,848
I'Il tell you the best part
after work.

96
00:13:31,948 --> 00:13:33,848
This is why nobody
will work with you...

97
00:13:33,948 --> 00:13:36,948
why you're the only cop in the
department without a partner.

98
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:40,182
Johnson, look, first of all,
ifyou want a date with me...

99
00:13:40,282 --> 00:13:42,849
you have to wait on the list
like every other woman, OK?

100
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:44,882
Second of all, I work alone.

101
00:13:45,183 --> 00:13:48,116
I don't need no partner
and ain't never gonna have one.

102
00:13:48,183 --> 00:13:50,116
-Did Kojak have a partner?
-Yeah. The fat guy.

103
00:13:50,216 --> 00:13:52,117
He wasn't never with him.
Did Columbo?

104
00:13:52,217 --> 00:13:53,883
Captain Diel ordered me
to go with you...

105
00:13:54,217 --> 00:13:58,451
you needed bomb squad backup, but once
again you screwed me and yourself.

106
00:13:58,551 --> 00:14:00,384
Look, Johnson,
it's dangerous out there.

107
00:14:00,484 --> 00:14:02,718
It's safer for you
to be behind the desk.

108
00:14:02,818 --> 00:14:05,385
We were supposed to be
on the same team.

109
00:14:05,485 --> 00:14:09,852
This is LAPD, the most hated cops
in the free world.

110
00:14:10,185 --> 00:14:12,852
My own mama ashamed of me.
She tell everybody l'm a drug dealer.

111
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,186
This is a pit stop for me.

112
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,186
I'm on the verge of leaving
you suckers behind.

113
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:20,853
Actually, you're on the verge
of being suspended. Have a nice day.

114
00:14:25,553 --> 00:14:29,220
Somebody told you
I was being suspended?

115
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:32,554
Quit playin', girl.

116
00:14:34,654 --> 00:14:35,954
I know you playin'.

117
00:14:37,621 --> 00:14:39,621
Somebody told you
I was being suspended?

118
00:14:42,155 --> 00:14:44,855
This is a problem. That's all I needed.
Some foreigner...

119
00:14:45,522 --> 00:14:48,189
getting his head blown off
and creating an international incident.

120
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:50,889
What can we do?
He's on the his way.

121
00:14:52,223 --> 00:14:54,489
Call the field office.
Have them send over a rookie.

122
00:14:54,556 --> 00:14:56,823
We'Il have him escort this guy
around a few days...

123
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:00,523
pretend to follow some leads,
keep him out of our way.

124
00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:03,124
You want to do that
to one ofthe men?

125
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,457
What do you suggest?

126
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,458
Well, as long as we're gonna
humiliate someone...

127
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,125
might as well be LAPD.

128
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:18,459
Even if I had an extra man who would
want such a bullshit assignment?

129
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:22,126
Well, it's a disgrace to me.
A disgrace to my department.

130
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:24,126
It's a disgrace to...

131
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:28,693
Dan, l'm sending someone
right over.

132
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,227
Captain, I know you read
the paper, but they lying.

133
00:15:35,327 --> 00:15:38,994
I wouldn't do anything like that.
Theyjust want a story.

134
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:41,994
Two officers were shot.
One man lost a pinkie.

135
00:15:42,328 --> 00:15:44,661
-But nobody died.
-You destroyed half a block.

136
00:15:44,994 --> 00:15:47,561
-That block was messed up.
-You lost lots of evidence.

137
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:49,228
We got a little left.

138
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:52,229
What you did was dangerous
and completely against policy.

139
00:15:52,362 --> 00:15:53,995
And not only that...

140
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:57,329
you did a good job.

141
00:15:58,029 --> 00:15:59,229
What?

142
00:15:59,363 --> 00:16:01,563
Everyone around here
is so image-conscious.

143
00:16:01,663 --> 00:16:03,896
So afraid oftheir own
goddamn shadow.

144
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:08,330
It's nice to meet a detective who's
willing to lay it on the line.

145
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:13,397
Captain,
that's the same way I feel.

146
00:16:13,497 --> 00:16:16,331
Every so often, we have to let
the general public know...

147
00:16:16,398 --> 00:16:20,798
-that we can still blow shit up.
-That's the only way I work.

148
00:16:21,832 --> 00:16:23,465
So that mean
I ain't getting suspended?

149
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:25,799
-Are you kidding?
-Don't know why I said that.

150
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:27,799
I just got a call from the FBl.

151
00:16:28,165 --> 00:16:29,699
The 10-year-old daughter
of a Chinese diplomat...

152
00:16:29,832 --> 00:16:33,033
was kidnapped this morning,
and they want you on the case.

153
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,166
-FBI want me?
-That's right.

154
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,833
-Stop lying.
-I don't lie.

155
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,167
-Tell the truth.
-I'm telling the truth.

156
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,500
Thank you, Captain.

157
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:46,034
Congratulations, Carter.
You are going to the show.

158
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:48,701
I'Il look out for you
when I reach the top.

159
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:51,168
-I'Il make you mayor.
-I'd rather you didn't.

160
00:16:53,835 --> 00:16:57,168
Hey, listen up!
lf anybody need me...

161
00:16:57,502 --> 00:17:00,835
I'm gonna be working
a big, big case for the FBl!

162
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,804
Yo. Take care ofthat for me.

163
00:17:34,472 --> 00:17:37,472
I need one ofthose earpieces
immediately, all right?

164
00:17:38,172 --> 00:17:39,473
Hey, how you doin'?

165
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,706
I want the consul's personnel
records cross-checked...

166
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,206
with that new list
we received from lnterpol.

167
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,873
See ifyou can make
any matches or connections.

168
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,207
OK, boys, what have we got?

169
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,540
Have you checked the consul
personnel records yet?

170
00:17:51,874 --> 00:17:53,774
I want to know
who's he been talking with.

171
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:57,141
OK, come on. Give me the story.
Any demands? Any fingerprints?

172
00:17:58,475 --> 00:18:00,708
Whitney, who's this?

173
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,708
Give me a copy ofthat.

174
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,042
James Carter, FBl.

175
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:08,376
Warren, he's here
for the special assignment.

176
00:18:11,776 --> 00:18:15,643
I'm Agent in charge Warren Russ.
It's good to have you aboard.

177
00:18:15,776 --> 00:18:17,443
I waited a long time for this.

178
00:18:17,776 --> 00:18:20,443
You guys sure take a long time
to process an application.

179
00:18:20,777 --> 00:18:26,344
Well, Carter, your particular assignment
is considered G-14 classified.

180
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:31,044
Why don't you and I take a walk
and l'Il fill you in?

181
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:41,779
G-14 classified.
That's good.

182
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:44,379
You don't understand.
This is my dream.

183
00:18:44,712 --> 00:18:46,613
I'm very excited about
working with the FBl.

184
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,346
I'm glad.
Listen, his name is Lee.

185
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,813
And the director considers
this a top priority.

186
00:18:52,147 --> 00:18:56,047
But he's gonna get in my way.
I'm not used to having a partner.

187
00:18:56,147 --> 00:18:58,814
If l'm handling the situation,
l'm gonna have to work alone.

188
00:18:59,714 --> 00:19:01,047
He is the situation.

189
00:19:02,448 --> 00:19:04,314
Must be a misunderstanding.

190
00:19:04,448 --> 00:19:07,381
I was sent down here for
the kidnapping. Little girl?

191
00:19:07,781 --> 00:19:10,115
Forget the little girl.
Your assignment is Lee.

192
00:19:11,815 --> 00:19:13,682
Who is Lee and what kind
of assignment is that?

193
00:19:13,815 --> 00:19:16,482
Lee is a foreign detective
and a friend ofthe consul's.

194
00:19:16,816 --> 00:19:19,816
It's yourjob to keep him out
of sight and away from danger.

195
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,683
You want me to baby-sit,
but I don't do that.

196
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,717
I came down here
for the big assignment.

197
00:19:27,117 --> 00:19:30,950
This is an FBI operation and I don't
need any help from LAPD...

198
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,717
or some Chun-King cop.
You got it?

199
00:19:35,318 --> 00:19:36,984
Whoa. Hold it.

200
00:19:37,318 --> 00:19:39,851
Why not use your men
for this top priority case?

201
00:19:39,985 --> 00:19:41,651
What am I supposed to do,
take him to the zoo?

202
00:19:41,985 --> 00:19:45,985
I don't give a damn. I don't want to
see him or you till this is resolved.

203
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,319
His plane arrives in one hour.
We want to make a good impression.

204
00:19:50,986 --> 00:19:53,353
It's his first trip to America.

205
00:19:55,386 --> 00:19:56,720
This is bullshit!

206
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,524
Please tell me
you speak English.

207
00:20:39,857 --> 00:20:43,858
I'm Detective Carter!
Do you speak any English?

208
00:20:47,191 --> 00:20:51,825
Do you understand the words
that are coming out of my mouth?

209
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:59,626
I cannot believe this shit!

210
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,960
First, I get a bullshit assignment,
now, Mr. Rice-a-Roni...

211
00:21:05,293 --> 00:21:07,293
don't even speak American.

212
00:21:08,327 --> 00:21:10,327
Come on. My ride's over here.

213
00:21:12,994 --> 00:21:14,627
Put your bag in the back.

214
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:22,328
Put your bag in the back!

215
00:21:23,662 --> 00:21:27,995
You put your own shit
in the back!

216
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:32,329
I am not a skycap.
I'm FBl, you understand?

217
00:21:35,663 --> 00:21:37,663
What the hell you think this is?

218
00:21:41,063 --> 00:21:42,664
Captain, I don't think
this is funny.

219
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,897
No, l'm serious, Captain.
Tell the FBI you made a mistake.

220
00:21:47,031 --> 00:21:48,664
I can't do that.

221
00:21:49,031 --> 00:21:52,365
I'm sure that you and Mr. Lee
will have a nice time together.

222
00:21:52,698 --> 00:21:56,232
You better call the FBI or
I drop his ass at Panda Express.

223
00:21:56,365 --> 00:21:59,632
Drop this case, you're suspended
for two months without pay.

224
00:22:00,632 --> 00:22:02,966
You can forget about
being mayor then.

225
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:04,532
Congratulations, Carter.

226
00:22:04,632 --> 00:22:07,233
Looks like you finally
got yourself a partner.

227
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:12,933
One little pinkie get blowed off
and everybody trippin'.

228
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:16,900
Chinese consul?

229
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,901
That's one place you can't go.

230
00:22:20,301 --> 00:22:22,268
I ain't getting fired.
You gonna pay my bills?

231
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,668
That's the little girl?

232
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:29,335
Say something.

233
00:22:31,002 --> 00:22:32,535
Y'all think this is real funny.

234
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:35,336
Give Carter
the big G-14 classified case.

235
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:38,002
Gonna show the FBI they don't
know who they are playing with.

236
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,003
I'Il solve this case myself.

237
00:22:41,003 --> 00:22:42,003
That's right.

238
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,304
But I wanna show you something
first. Look familiar?

239
00:22:55,638 --> 00:22:57,304
Just like home, ain't it?

240
00:22:57,638 --> 00:23:01,271
I ain't never been to China,
but it probably look like this.

241
00:23:01,938 --> 00:23:03,605
Get your star maps!

242
00:23:04,272 --> 00:23:05,939
Look, John Wayne.

243
00:23:06,939 --> 00:23:08,939
You know John Wayne?

244
00:23:09,939 --> 00:23:12,173
Yeah, man.
Hang out with the Duke.

245
00:23:12,273 --> 00:23:14,939
I'Il be right back. You might see
one ofyour cousins here.

246
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,607
Right here!
Star maps!

247
00:23:23,207 --> 00:23:25,541
You got the address
to Michael Jackson's house?

248
00:23:25,874 --> 00:23:28,774
You can't come around myjob.
That's harassment.

249
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,108
I'm just checking up on you.

250
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,475
I'm fully legit now.
I'm selling star maps.

251
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,141
Legit my ass.

252
00:23:34,275 --> 00:23:37,608
You and your Asian gang friends
know about a kidnapping?

253
00:23:37,942 --> 00:23:39,275
I don't know nothing.

254
00:23:39,942 --> 00:23:41,275
Give me one ofthem star maps...

255
00:23:41,976 --> 00:23:44,276
for $45, you understand
what l'm saying?

256
00:23:45,209 --> 00:23:47,209
Don't know nothin'
about no kidnapping...

257
00:23:47,543 --> 00:23:50,543
but this dude's buying firearms,
explosives, and people...

258
00:23:50,876 --> 00:23:52,877
-Iike he's gonna start a war.
-What's his name?

259
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:56,877
-For $45, I don't know his name.
-You better tell me something.

260
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,511
-I don't know nothing for $45.
-Stucky, you don't...

261
00:24:01,844 --> 00:24:03,511
I didn't tell you nothing!

262
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:48,816
Didn't I tell you
to wait for me?

263
00:24:49,149 --> 00:24:51,816
What the hell you doing
on this bus?

264
00:24:53,149 --> 00:24:55,150
Think l'm playing with you?

265
00:24:55,816 --> 00:24:58,183
I ain't playing with you.
Sit down.

266
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,184
All right.
It's OK.

267
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,850
It's all right. FBl.

268
00:25:06,184 --> 00:25:07,851
Take a picture.
Wait a minute.

269
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:18,519
What?

270
00:25:18,785 --> 00:25:20,452
Get out of my way!

271
00:25:27,353 --> 00:25:29,020
FBl. Stop this bus.

272
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,687
Hey, look.

273
00:25:41,054 --> 00:25:43,721
Hey, kids, get back in here.
Sit down.

274
00:25:51,722 --> 00:25:54,722
Stop! FBl!
I need this motorcycle.

275
00:25:55,122 --> 00:25:56,722
-No way, man.
-Get off!

276
00:26:22,025 --> 00:26:23,992
Get out ofthe car!
Get out ofthe car now!

277
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:28,292
Where you think you're going?
Didn't I say to stay by the Duke?

278
00:26:28,392 --> 00:26:32,059
-What do you think you're doing?
-Mind your own business.

279
00:26:32,626 --> 00:26:34,559
Hey. What you doing?

280
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:37,293
You thought
I was gonna shoot you?

281
00:26:37,626 --> 00:26:39,293
What's happening here?

282
00:26:41,293 --> 00:26:44,294
Put the gun down.
I ain't playing with you!

283
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,294
-Think l'm playing with you?
-Don't move!

284
00:26:49,294 --> 00:26:50,628
Drop your guns.

285
00:26:51,628 --> 00:26:55,962
-Look. FBl.
-I'm policeman.

286
00:26:56,962 --> 00:26:59,862
I'm just showing him
to take a gun from a suspect.

287
00:27:01,562 --> 00:27:03,529
All of a sudden
you speaking English?

288
00:27:03,896 --> 00:27:05,796
-A little.
-My ass. You lied to me.

289
00:27:06,163 --> 00:27:08,163
I didn't say I didn't.
You assumed so.

290
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:11,196
Assume I kick you little
Beijing ass right now.

291
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,197
I know you know
that tricky shit.

292
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,530
I'm not responsible
for your assumptions.

293
00:27:16,197 --> 00:27:18,197
You full of shit,
you understand that?

294
00:27:19,197 --> 00:27:21,864
Not being able to speak
is not the same as not speaking.

295
00:27:22,531 --> 00:27:24,064
You seem as ifyou like to talk.

296
00:27:24,198 --> 00:27:26,131
I let people talk
who like to talk.

297
00:27:26,198 --> 00:27:29,532
It makes easier to find out
how full of shit they are.

298
00:27:30,865 --> 00:27:33,899
What the hell did you just say?
I like people to talk...

299
00:27:35,899 --> 00:27:38,933
-So l'm the one full of shit?
-We both full of shit.

300
00:27:39,233 --> 00:27:40,599
You full of shit.

301
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:44,900
I'm gonna kick your ass.

302
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:47,933
Don't nobody do that but me.

303
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:50,234
You want me to kick your ass,
don't you?

304
00:27:55,434 --> 00:27:57,434
You must take me to see
Consul Han right away.

305
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,701
Just sit there and shut up.
This ain't no democracy.

306
00:28:02,035 --> 00:28:04,035
-Yes, it is.
-No, it ain't.

307
00:28:04,702 --> 00:28:07,369
This is the United States
of James Carter now.

308
00:28:07,702 --> 00:28:10,369
I'm the president,
l'm the emperor, l'm the king.

309
00:28:10,702 --> 00:28:14,369
I'm Michael Jackson, you Tito.
Your ass belong to me.

310
00:28:15,536 --> 00:28:17,536
Why would they not want my help?

311
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:21,470
'Cause they don't give a damn about you.
They don't like you. I don't like you.

312
00:28:21,537 --> 00:28:23,704
I don't care.
I'm here for the girl.

313
00:28:23,804 --> 00:28:26,471
The girl don't like you.
Nobody likes you.

314
00:28:26,837 --> 00:28:28,804
You came all the way
over here for nothing.

315
00:28:29,171 --> 00:28:30,504
You ain't gonna be...

316
00:28:31,171 --> 00:28:32,505
Beach Boys.

317
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:34,505
Oh, hell, no.

318
00:28:34,871 --> 00:28:36,872
You didn't just touch
my goddamn radio.

319
00:28:37,205 --> 00:28:39,105
The Beach Boys are
great American music.

320
00:28:39,205 --> 00:28:41,539
The Beach Boys will get you
a great ass-whoopin'.

321
00:28:41,872 --> 00:28:43,839
Don't ever touch
a black man's radio, boy.

322
00:28:44,172 --> 00:28:47,139
You can do that in China but you'Il get
your ass killed out here.

323
00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:50,173
Let me show you real music.

324
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:54,040
That's real music.
You hear that?

325
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:08,342
Now can you do that
to the Beach Boys? Hell no!

326
00:29:22,943 --> 00:29:25,477
I must get to the consulate.
What are we doing here?

327
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:28,544
It's called a shakedown.
Very serious police work.

328
00:29:28,944 --> 00:29:31,277
Just watch me handle my business
and patrol this place.

329
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:34,544
I want to help with
the investigation. This is my case.

330
00:29:36,844 --> 00:29:40,045
Your case?
Look, you can back me up.

331
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:43,845
When we get in here, follow
my lead and do what I do.

332
00:29:51,512 --> 00:29:53,179
What's up, my nigger?

333
00:29:56,513 --> 00:29:58,180
-Is this weed?
-What?

334
00:30:02,214 --> 00:30:04,547
You got a prescription for this?
Where is it?

335
00:30:05,547 --> 00:30:07,947
Where is it?
Where?

336
00:30:12,881 --> 00:30:14,881
-I should take your ass to jail.
-For what?

337
00:30:15,215 --> 00:30:17,882
-Look at this!
-That's nothing but a cigarette.

338
00:30:18,215 --> 00:30:20,215
-This ciga-weed!
-Well, it look like cigarette.

339
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:22,216
-You better have glaucoma.
-I do.

340
00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:29,483
What's up, my nigger?

341
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,850
Check that, baby.

342
00:30:41,184 --> 00:30:42,818
What's happening, Carter?

343
00:30:43,851 --> 00:30:46,218
Put the guns down.

344
00:30:46,551 --> 00:30:49,452
M.C.Hammer there,
put the goddamn gun down.

345
00:30:49,552 --> 00:30:52,119
I got some questions,
and I need some answers.

346
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:53,885
-Put'em down.
-Where the girl?

347
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:55,786
-What girl?
-The little girl.

348
00:30:55,886 --> 00:30:57,552
-What little girl?
-The Chinese girl.

349
00:30:57,886 --> 00:30:59,486
I don't know nothin'
about no Chinese girl.

350
00:30:59,819 --> 00:31:03,486
I'Il take your asses in
if I don't get answers.

351
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,387
-Carter, put the gun down.
-Don't act like you know me.

352
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:11,154
I see what's going on here.
You trying to play me like a fool.

353
00:31:11,854 --> 00:31:15,021
Lee, go outside real quick. It's gonna
get a little dangerous in here.

354
00:31:15,154 --> 00:31:19,121
-I may have quest...
-Lee, go and wait by the bar.

355
00:31:19,455 --> 00:31:22,455
-I'Il take care of everything.
-You sure?

356
00:31:22,822 --> 00:31:24,488
I'm sure.
Go on now.

357
00:31:26,822 --> 00:31:28,522
Think l'm playing?

358
00:31:28,856 --> 00:31:30,189
Hurry up!

359
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:39,857
Don't come in my business
scaring me like that.

360
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,157
I was just playing.
Man, give me a hug.

361
00:31:42,457 --> 00:31:44,690
Just schooling the rookie,
showing him the ropes.

362
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,691
Why you didn't come
to church Sunday?

363
00:31:46,791 --> 00:31:48,691
I had some things
to take care of.

364
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:50,791
But I made the night service.

365
00:31:51,124 --> 00:31:53,125
Come here,
I wanna holler at you.

366
00:31:53,825 --> 00:31:57,492
Who's this guy buying up
these explosives and weapons?

367
00:31:57,825 --> 00:31:59,325
I don't know
nothing about that.

368
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,659
Luke, I know what you do.

369
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,626
The only reason why
I ain't busted your ass...

370
00:32:03,726 --> 00:32:06,693
'cause you my cousin,
and it'd kill Aunt Bootsy.

371
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,293
-Why you put Aunt Bootsy in this?
-I ain't playing.

372
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,393
I know she got a bad heart,
but I will bust your ass.

373
00:32:14,727 --> 00:32:16,394
Tell me something.

374
00:32:19,061 --> 00:32:22,328
The word down in Chinatown is
there's this new dude in town.

375
00:32:22,394 --> 00:32:26,661
Bad-ass dude outta Hong Kong
buying up every goddamn thing.

376
00:32:26,728 --> 00:32:28,728
-What's his name?
-Don't know.

377
00:32:29,062 --> 00:32:31,395
-He ain't buying shit from me.
-You don't know his name?

378
00:32:32,129 --> 00:32:33,729
Don't nobody know his name.

379
00:32:41,696 --> 00:32:43,330
What's up, my nigger?

380
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,663
What did you just say?

381
00:32:48,364 --> 00:32:50,697
What's up, my nigger?

382
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:04,898
Come here!
You better watch your mouth!

383
00:33:06,232 --> 00:33:09,266
-What you say, boy?
-I don't want trouble.

384
00:33:58,537 --> 00:33:59,471
Please...

385
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,871
I said I don't want trouble.

386
00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:05,538
That's bad for you.

387
00:34:10,538 --> 00:34:12,539
-Where the little girl at?
-What little girl?

388
00:34:12,705 --> 00:34:14,672
You know what girl
l'm talking about.

389
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:17,706
Man, you better take
your goddamn hands off my suit.

390
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:21,039
Your mama bought me
this suit for Christmas.

391
00:34:22,106 --> 00:34:24,773
I'Il see you Thanksgiving.
Appreciate it.

392
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:27,307
Get your big
Happy-Meal ass over.

393
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,774
Get over in the corner!
l'm still the law around here!

394
00:34:30,107 --> 00:34:32,441
Next time I come here,
y'all better clean this up!

395
00:34:32,774 --> 00:34:34,374
And brush your teeth!
Let's go.

396
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:41,875
-What are we doing here?
-I'm getting something to eat.

397
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:44,542
You want anything,
like a Cup O'Noodles?

398
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:49,209
Stop wasting my time.
I made a promise to Soo Yung.

399
00:34:49,542 --> 00:34:51,809
You're right.
I have been wasting your time.

400
00:34:51,876 --> 00:34:55,210
I'm sorry. Just let me
go get something to eat.

401
00:34:55,543 --> 00:34:57,876
When I come back out, l'Il take
you wherever you want to go.

402
00:34:59,177 --> 00:35:00,510
Shake on it?

403
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,310
What are you doing?

404
00:35:04,444 --> 00:35:07,144
You ain't the only one
with quick hands, are you?

405
00:35:07,311 --> 00:35:08,978
I'Il be right back.

406
00:35:16,312 --> 00:35:18,278
I got you a beef-and-bean burrito.

407
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,214
We have a taxicab approaching.
A man stepping out. Asian.

408
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,881
We've got someone approaching the gate.
Dropped off by a cab.

409
00:35:44,214 --> 00:35:46,548
-Tell them to intercept.
-Intercept.

410
00:35:47,215 --> 00:35:49,282
We will intercept.

411
00:35:54,615 --> 00:35:57,282
-Can I help you?
-Yes. I must see the consul.

412
00:35:57,616 --> 00:36:00,549
-About what?
-Please, it's very important.

413
00:36:00,883 --> 00:36:03,550
Why don't you tell us why
you need to see the consul?

414
00:36:03,883 --> 00:36:05,850
We'Il tell you
whether it is important.

415
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,617
Do you have identification?

416
00:36:08,884 --> 00:36:11,817
-It's about his daughter Soo Yung.
-Hands above your head!

417
00:36:11,884 --> 00:36:14,851
-He asked about the consul's daughter.
-He asked about the daughter.

418
00:36:15,184 --> 00:36:16,818
You don't understand.
I was invited.

419
00:36:21,818 --> 00:36:24,485
Don't move! Throw your gun away.

420
00:36:25,152 --> 00:36:27,052
-He's gonna kill them.
-Is everything all right?

421
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:29,152
You'Il be safer
on the second floor.

422
00:36:30,552 --> 00:36:32,886
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about this.

423
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:55,788
He went over.

424
00:37:31,058 --> 00:37:33,359
Stay away from the window, please.
Right here.

425
00:37:39,526 --> 00:37:41,193
Get down! Now!

426
00:37:55,494 --> 00:37:57,161
Don't move!

427
00:38:08,562 --> 00:38:12,463
I think there has been
a misunderstanding.

428
00:38:12,563 --> 00:38:14,229
It's all right. It's OK.

429
00:38:14,896 --> 00:38:17,563
It's him. The guy from China.

430
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:20,897
-What?
-Come in, please.

431
00:38:25,497 --> 00:38:30,498
Mr. Russ, I would like you
to meet Detective lnspector Lee.

432
00:38:30,831 --> 00:38:32,831
Excuse me very much.

433
00:38:35,498 --> 00:38:37,165
Your gun.

434
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:43,166
Where the hell is Carter?

435
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,767
Then I gotta put up with this.

436
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:56,667
See a little Asian dude
about this height...

437
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,334
with a steering wheel
on his arm?

438
00:38:58,701 --> 00:39:00,334
Go screw yourself.

439
00:39:01,034 --> 00:39:03,368
-What you say?
-I said go screw yourself.

440
00:39:03,734 --> 00:39:06,101
You take your sensitive ass
up there and let me in!

441
00:39:06,768 --> 00:39:09,102
Don't make me get up
out ofthis truck!

442
00:39:09,435 --> 00:39:12,435
Man, when I get up in here,
l'm slapping somebody.

443
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:14,102
What happened, Carter?

444
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,769
I ain't supposed to be
jumping on buses!

445
00:39:17,102 --> 00:39:18,769
I do not do that.
I am not Carl Lewis.

446
00:39:19,769 --> 00:39:21,103
Who is this man?

447
00:39:21,936 --> 00:39:23,170
Sir, I can explain.

448
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:26,203
Agent Carter has been helping
with my investigation.

449
00:39:26,303 --> 00:39:28,970
He's upset that we have not
done ourjob.

450
00:39:29,304 --> 00:39:31,971
Me and Lee are taking care
ofthe situation.

451
00:39:32,304 --> 00:39:33,837
We have everything
under control.

452
00:39:33,937 --> 00:39:35,871
We'Il get your daughter back
safe and sound.

453
00:39:36,204 --> 00:39:38,805
He is very passionate
about finding your daughter.

454
00:39:38,871 --> 00:39:40,805
Well, I owe you my gratitude.

455
00:39:40,938 --> 00:39:44,138
We wanted Detective Lee to have
one of our best men by his side.

456
00:39:44,272 --> 00:39:48,606
Maybe this is a good time to tell him
the details of my assignment.

457
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:52,873
Can I speak to you
for a moment?

458
00:39:53,273 --> 00:39:55,606
You wanna speak to me?
For a moment? ln private?

459
00:39:57,606 --> 00:40:00,607
Oh, I see!
This must be G-14 classified.

460
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,807
FBl-type stuff.

461
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,474
Let me call my captain and
let him know what's going on.

462
00:40:05,607 --> 00:40:09,308
We'Il talk in a second.
When a G-14 comes around.

463
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:13,975
-Who's this? Hello?
-Am I speaking with FBl?

464
00:40:14,641 --> 00:40:16,975
-Give me the phone.
-Yeah, this is the FBl.

465
00:40:17,308 --> 00:40:19,975
-You are FBl?
-Yeah, this is the FBl.

466
00:40:20,475 --> 00:40:23,342
Ifyou want the gnrl back alnve,
lnsten and do not talk.

467
00:40:23,476 --> 00:40:25,109
OK, l'm listening.
Let me get a pen.

468
00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:27,443
All right. Cool.

469
00:40:27,776 --> 00:40:30,643
The drop will be made tonight.
11:00 p.m.

470
00:40:30,776 --> 00:40:33,443
The amount will be $50 million.

471
00:40:33,643 --> 00:40:37,510
Fifty million dollars? Who you think
you kidnapped, Chelsea Clinton?

472
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,844
Keep him talking.
-In used currency.

473
00:40:39,977 --> 00:40:41,644
Nothnng bngger than a 50.

474
00:40:41,978 --> 00:40:44,311
All right. Cool.
Fifty million. No problem.

475
00:40:44,978 --> 00:40:47,311
I want 20 million in 50s...

476
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,312
Twenty million in 50s.

477
00:40:49,645 --> 00:40:51,545
Twenty million in 20s...

478
00:40:51,645 --> 00:40:55,012
-Twenty million in 20s.
-And 10 mnllnon nn 10s.

479
00:40:55,346 --> 00:40:58,613
And 10 million in 10s.
You want any fries with that?

480
00:40:59,313 --> 00:41:00,513
What is your name?

481
00:41:00,646 --> 00:41:03,180
You called us.
Why you want to know my name?

482
00:41:03,313 --> 00:41:05,980
I just want to be able to tell
the consul who's responsible...

483
00:41:06,313 --> 00:41:08,647
for his daughter's death
because he talks too much.

484
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,847
All right, hold up. Calm down.

485
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,981
I'm trying to hook you up.
I'm on your side.

486
00:41:13,614 --> 00:41:15,448
You will receive instruction
for the drop...

487
00:41:15,548 --> 00:41:17,881
half an hour before
it is to be made.

488
00:41:18,214 --> 00:41:21,148
If it is successful,
the girl will live.

489
00:41:21,215 --> 00:41:23,215
I'm gonna make sure
you get the money...

490
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:25,482
and we can spend it together
when you do...

491
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:27,882
'cause I don't even
really work for them.

492
00:41:28,882 --> 00:41:31,549
We got it.
620 South Broadway. Downtown.

493
00:41:43,317 --> 00:41:46,651
Team one, proceed down
to 6th and Broadway.

494
00:41:47,684 --> 00:41:50,884
Team two, I want you around
the back on 4th and Main.

495
00:41:51,018 --> 00:41:52,351
Set up a perimeter.

496
00:41:52,685 --> 00:41:56,652
Take your team and cover the building
all the way to the top. Move.

497
00:42:06,186 --> 00:42:08,186
They must not go
into the building.

498
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,186
Yeah, you right.
Let's go tell them. Come on.

499
00:42:14,887 --> 00:42:17,520
Mr. Russ, you must pull
your men back.

500
00:42:17,887 --> 00:42:20,287
What the hell are you doing here?
Where's Carter?

501
00:42:24,288 --> 00:42:25,621
Please, listen to me.

502
00:42:26,288 --> 00:42:28,288
You may be very competent
but the mere fact...

503
00:42:28,622 --> 00:42:31,288
that you know this girl
compromises yourjudgment.

504
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:39,389
Sir, ifyou were asking
for $50 million...

505
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,056
would you be in a place
like that?

506
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:44,056
Get this clown away from me.

507
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:45,723
Take a hike!

508
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:58,558
-Why were you hiding?
-What you talking about?

509
00:42:58,891 --> 00:43:02,225
-You were hiding.
-I bent down to tie my shoe.

510
00:43:02,992 --> 00:43:04,625
Sir, the area is secured.

511
00:43:04,992 --> 00:43:07,325
-Room's empty.
-Damn it!

512
00:43:25,661 --> 00:43:28,561
-Everybody pull back!
-Goddamn!

513
00:43:28,661 --> 00:43:30,661
Get some paramedics
down here now!

514
00:43:31,328 --> 00:43:33,661
Evacuate the building right away!
Get fire crews here!

515
00:43:33,995 --> 00:43:36,662
We got an explosion
at 6th and Broadway.

516
00:44:40,368 --> 00:44:42,002
That ain't far enough, man!

517
00:44:42,368 --> 00:44:45,335
I ain't Kareen Abdul-Jabbar!
Push it down some more!

518
00:45:48,008 --> 00:45:50,008
Carter, don't come any... stop!

519
00:45:50,342 --> 00:45:51,675
What the hell...

520
00:46:14,777 --> 00:46:17,044
I think I done broke my shit.

521
00:46:17,378 --> 00:46:19,311
Who was that you was chasing?

522
00:46:19,378 --> 00:46:23,378
His name is Sang from Hong Kong.
Because ofyou he got away.

523
00:46:23,712 --> 00:46:25,379
Why you ain't tell me
about the bridge?

524
00:46:25,712 --> 00:46:27,045
-I did.
-No, you didn't.

525
00:46:27,379 --> 00:46:29,379
I said stop.

526
00:46:29,712 --> 00:46:31,312
I don't understand
what you be saying.

527
00:46:31,379 --> 00:46:32,646
What?

528
00:46:32,713 --> 00:46:34,713
You see what l'm saying?

529
00:46:35,046 --> 00:46:38,380
-What's this in your hand?
-He dropped it.

530
00:46:39,047 --> 00:46:41,447
Oh, shit.
Come on.

531
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,447
-Where are we going?
-I messed up my suit.

532
00:46:55,048 --> 00:46:56,682
Fifteen seconds.

533
00:47:02,649 --> 00:47:04,282
Make a decision.

534
00:47:11,283 --> 00:47:12,950
Oh, shit!

535
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:16,550
Did I come at a bad time?

536
00:47:16,884 --> 00:47:19,884
I got bad news for you, Johnson.
We're all dead.

537
00:47:20,284 --> 00:47:21,818
I was distracted, sir.

538
00:47:21,951 --> 00:47:23,951
Distractions can occur
in the field.

539
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:25,951
That's why we call
this practice.

540
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:28,652
Ifyou can't handle the pressure,
then quit.

541
00:47:29,518 --> 00:47:32,152
Man, give her a break.
Don't worry about him.

542
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:35,152
How you doing, girl?
Give me some love.

543
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:39,019
-Why are you tormenting me?
-That any way to treat an old friend?

544
00:47:39,386 --> 00:47:41,720
I came to see how you was doing,
and I need some help.

545
00:47:42,053 --> 00:47:43,020
Help?

546
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,687
I know that you have
strong feelings for me...

547
00:47:46,053 --> 00:47:49,387
but we gotta put that aside. It's
a little girl's life at stake here.

548
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,287
Since when do you care about
anybody but yourself?

549
00:47:52,387 --> 00:47:54,554
Please, just take a look at this.

550
00:47:54,687 --> 00:47:57,321
We found this on a kidnapper.
Tell me what this is.

551
00:47:57,554 --> 00:48:00,488
You want me to work with you?
I don't have time for this.

552
00:48:00,555 --> 00:48:02,955
I got my own shit to deal with.

553
00:48:04,955 --> 00:48:07,222
-Who are you?
-Sorry we got you in trouble.

554
00:48:07,355 --> 00:48:10,322
Yeah, he's sorry. Tell me
something about this I don't know.

555
00:48:10,689 --> 00:48:13,323
A remote. Could be nitro cap,
could be cross-delayed...

556
00:48:13,689 --> 00:48:15,556
definitely not homemade,
definitely not American.

557
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:18,357
I could open up a garage door,
or blow up some C4.

558
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:20,023
C4?

559
00:48:20,357 --> 00:48:21,690
Yeah, C4.

560
00:48:23,624 --> 00:48:25,957
This means so much to me.

561
00:48:28,291 --> 00:48:30,291
Hey, and l'm sorry about
spreading all those rumors...

562
00:48:30,624 --> 00:48:32,625
on Christmas about us
sleeping together.

563
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:35,958
-What?
-He's just joking.

564
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:44,026
Hey, Bobby, what's up, man?

565
00:48:45,693 --> 00:48:48,660
-I need to see Clive Cod.
-No way, Carter.

566
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:52,027
It's lights out.
You want me to lose myjob?

567
00:48:52,727 --> 00:48:55,694
I got you this damn job.
You better let me in here.

568
00:48:55,794 --> 00:48:57,127
Can't do it.

569
00:48:57,394 --> 00:49:00,327
Didn't I turn my back when
you bought that bag ofweed?

570
00:49:00,661 --> 00:49:02,228
I was splitting it with you.

571
00:49:02,328 --> 00:49:05,661
Didn't I give you the bigger half?
Do me this favor.

572
00:49:07,328 --> 00:49:09,995
Shit. You got five minutes.

573
00:49:10,662 --> 00:49:11,995
Hey, Cod.

574
00:49:12,362 --> 00:49:14,662
Your two brothers
are here to see you.

575
00:49:19,729 --> 00:49:22,696
Clive, how you doing, man?

576
00:49:23,396 --> 00:49:25,063
You got a lot of balls,
coming here.

577
00:49:25,397 --> 00:49:27,963
I was just around the way.
Figured you would be bored.

578
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:31,630
-I came to see how you was doing.
-What the hell do you want?

579
00:49:31,731 --> 00:49:33,231
I just came to bring you a gift.

580
00:49:33,364 --> 00:49:36,031
I know you got time to kill.
I brought you a toy.

581
00:49:36,698 --> 00:49:38,031
-I don't want that.
-You don't?

582
00:49:38,365 --> 00:49:40,298
Somebody told me
you like this stuff.

583
00:49:40,365 --> 00:49:42,965
I don't like stuff like that.
I don't even know what it is.

584
00:49:43,032 --> 00:49:44,698
You never sold this to nobody?

585
00:49:45,032 --> 00:49:47,032
How could l,
when I don't know what it is?

586
00:49:47,365 --> 00:49:49,366
-Hold it.
-I don't want to hold it.

587
00:49:49,699 --> 00:49:51,699
-Just touch it.
-I don't want to touch it.

588
00:49:52,033 --> 00:49:54,033
-You scared of it?
-You think l'm stupid?

589
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:57,366
-Stupid enough to get busted.
-You want my fingerprints, to frame me.

590
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,700
Why would I do something like that?
Think I would try tricking you again?

591
00:50:01,067 --> 00:50:04,700
I don't have to frame you. You'Il do
life for killing the little girl.

592
00:50:05,101 --> 00:50:07,034
I don't know anything
about a little girl.

593
00:50:07,434 --> 00:50:09,068
That ain't
what l'Il tell everybody.

594
00:50:09,434 --> 00:50:12,435
-I don't know anything.
-I got a big mouth, Clive.

595
00:50:12,768 --> 00:50:15,102
Let me tell you something.
I don't know anything about that...

596
00:50:15,435 --> 00:50:16,968
so you can kiss my fat ass.

597
00:50:17,135 --> 00:50:19,469
It'd take me all day
to kiss your fat ass.

598
00:50:19,802 --> 00:50:22,469
You want some ofthis?
l'Il give you all you want.

599
00:50:23,102 --> 00:50:26,036
-Give me a name.
-I ain't telling you shit.

600
00:50:28,703 --> 00:50:32,703
She's only 11 years old.
I don't want her to die.

601
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:35,037
Look at the picture.

602
00:50:35,437 --> 00:50:39,437
I don't care about him or you.
I care about the little girl.

603
00:50:40,104 --> 00:50:41,771
Give me the name.

604
00:50:52,139 --> 00:50:55,106
The guy's name is Juntao.
I never seen him.

605
00:50:55,806 --> 00:50:59,373
-Where can I find him?
-Foo Chow Restaurant. Chinatown.

606
00:51:00,373 --> 00:51:03,006
Get rid ofthis guy.
He'Il get you killed.

607
00:51:03,106 --> 00:51:06,007
Clive, thank you, man.
I'm gonna come back.

608
00:51:06,107 --> 00:51:08,107
I'm gonna bring your fat ass
some cookies.

609
00:51:26,175 --> 00:51:27,842
That's it right there.

610
00:51:32,176 --> 00:51:34,176
What are we waiting for?

611
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:38,510
We scoping the place out, man.
Ain't gonna run up in there.

612
00:51:42,844 --> 00:51:44,477
I'm falling asleep.

613
00:52:20,481 --> 00:52:23,814
-You don't know anything about no war.
-Everybody knows war.

614
00:52:33,182 --> 00:52:35,849
It ain't you all, it's y'all.

615
00:52:39,449 --> 00:52:41,449
Man, you sound like
a karate movie. Y'all!

616
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:44,816
Say it from right here
with some soul. Y'all.

617
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:50,150
Let me show your goofy ass
how to do this.

618
00:53:05,185 --> 00:53:06,519
Come on, come on.

619
00:53:19,953 --> 00:53:21,287
Do that again.

620
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:23,620
Do it again. Like this.

621
00:54:12,659 --> 00:54:15,192
One will be inserted into the suitcase.
The other will be on you.

622
00:54:15,492 --> 00:54:16,792
When you make the drop...

623
00:54:21,126 --> 00:54:23,793
-Do we have it?
-All right, pick it up.

624
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,160
-You have what I asked for?
-I do.

625
00:54:28,494 --> 00:54:31,160
I hope nowyou realnze
howsernous I am.

626
00:54:31,494 --> 00:54:35,394
Take the money to the alleybehnnd
the Foo Chow Restaurant.

627
00:54:36,061 --> 00:54:38,128
You have 29 minutes left.

628
00:54:52,196 --> 00:54:55,130
Damn, Chen,
this is some greasy shit.

629
00:54:55,196 --> 00:54:58,030
You ain't got no better food
like some chicken wings...

630
00:54:58,163 --> 00:55:02,164
-some fries or something?
-Chinese food, no soul food here.

631
00:55:02,497 --> 00:55:05,331
I didn't say soul food.
I said better food.

632
00:55:05,397 --> 00:55:08,064
How you gonna sell
a big box of grease?

633
00:55:08,398 --> 00:55:10,398
I'm chilly a what?

634
00:55:10,731 --> 00:55:12,065
Come on.

635
00:55:13,065 --> 00:55:15,332
-I'm no punk bitch.
-I ain't no punk bitch neither.

636
00:55:15,398 --> 00:55:17,732
-I'm no punk bitch.
-I'Il knock your hat off.

637
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,465
-Man, what you got me eating?
-That's eel.

638
00:55:22,132 --> 00:55:24,432
-Is it good?
-Very good.

639
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:27,366
-What you got?
-Camel's hump.

640
00:55:27,733 --> 00:55:31,066
-What?
-Camel's hump.

641
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,634
Kinda good.

642
00:55:39,767 --> 00:55:42,434
Need a little hot sauce,
but it's kinda good, though.

643
00:55:43,801 --> 00:55:45,801
We still waiting?

644
00:55:48,468 --> 00:55:50,368
How we gonna get Juntao?

645
00:55:50,468 --> 00:55:52,802
How we know he exists?
Ain't nobody seen him.

646
00:55:53,135 --> 00:55:55,136
I know. He killed my partner.

647
00:55:56,969 --> 00:55:58,803
I'm sorry about that, man.

648
00:55:58,936 --> 00:56:02,270
That's why I have no partner.
I learned that from my daddy.

649
00:56:03,603 --> 00:56:06,637
-Your daddy was a policeman?
-Fifteen years LAPD.

650
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:09,837
-My father was also a policeman.
-Your daddy was a cop?

651
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:13,271
Not a cop, an officer.
A legend all over Hong Kong.

652
00:56:13,604 --> 00:56:15,538
My daddy a legend, too.
All over America.

653
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:18,805
My daddy once arrested 15 people
in one night by himself.

654
00:56:18,871 --> 00:56:21,205
My daddy arrested 25 by himself.

655
00:56:21,872 --> 00:56:25,205
My daddy saved five crackheads from
a burning building by himself.

656
00:56:25,539 --> 00:56:28,205
My daddy once caught a bullet
with his bare hands.

657
00:56:28,872 --> 00:56:32,139
My daddy'Il kick your daddy's ass
all the way from here to China...

658
00:56:32,206 --> 00:56:34,873
or Japan or wherever you from.
All up that Great Wall, too.

659
00:56:35,206 --> 00:56:37,206
-Don't talk about my father.
-Don't talk about my daddy.

660
00:56:39,207 --> 00:56:42,540
-Hey, that your boy?
-Yes, let's go.

661
00:56:45,641 --> 00:56:48,007
I better go in first.
Ain't nobody gonna recognize me.

662
00:56:48,674 --> 00:56:50,008
I'Il wait five minutes.

663
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:52,608
Hey, you take my ID.

664
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:56,342
If anything go wrong,
you bust in like you're LAPD.

665
00:57:00,675 --> 00:57:02,342
This won't work.
I'm not 6'1.

666
00:57:02,642 --> 00:57:04,976
Yes, it will work.
It's all about attitude.

667
00:57:05,276 --> 00:57:08,610
Flip it open, flip it closed.
Do it fast. Open, close. Fast.

668
00:57:10,943 --> 00:57:13,610
You'Il get it. Look.
Take this.

669
00:57:18,444 --> 00:57:20,777
Hey, man, act like
you're from out oftown.

670
00:57:21,111 --> 00:57:24,778
-I am from out oftown.
-Don't act like a cop. Like a tourist.

671
00:57:25,111 --> 00:57:28,778
-Don't be so obvious. All right.
-OK, no problem.

672
00:57:31,979 --> 00:57:33,645
-How you doing?
-For one?

673
00:57:33,979 --> 00:57:36,646
No, for two. I'm here for a meeting
with Mr. Juntao.

674
00:57:37,312 --> 00:57:39,313
I'm sorry.
I don't know Mr. Juntao.

675
00:57:39,646 --> 00:57:42,546
Maybe you don't understand.
I'm Mr. Juntao's legal advisor.

676
00:57:42,646 --> 00:57:45,647
He got into some shit again.
I'm a very busy man.

677
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:47,880
I ain't got time
to be coming down here.

678
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:50,547
My wife wants me to come home,
baby's shitting all over.

679
00:57:50,647 --> 00:57:52,947
Would you please get Mr. Juntao?

680
00:57:53,281 --> 00:57:55,181
But I have already told you
I don't know...

681
00:57:55,281 --> 00:57:59,515
You think I came here for nothing?
You gonna give me gas money?

682
00:57:59,848 --> 00:58:03,182
Would you please go tell
Mr. Juntao to get his ass here?

683
00:58:04,182 --> 00:58:05,515
Thank you.

684
00:58:06,515 --> 00:58:09,182
Can I sit here?
Right here? Thank you.

685
00:58:13,183 --> 00:58:15,550
-Y'all got any eel?
-Sure.

686
00:58:16,616 --> 00:58:18,983
How's your camel hump?

687
00:58:19,983 --> 00:58:21,317
Excuse me?

688
00:58:22,317 --> 00:58:24,617
Where is Roscoe's
Chicken and Waffles?

689
00:58:25,284 --> 00:58:26,951
This way?

690
00:58:28,951 --> 00:58:30,951
I'm sorry.
I'm from out oftown.

691
00:58:31,618 --> 00:58:34,285
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

692
00:58:36,185 --> 00:58:37,518
What's that?

693
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:19,889
No, wait.

694
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:28,123
Get the girl out of here.

695
00:59:28,223 --> 00:59:30,890
Make sure those two don't leave.

696
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:27,963
-Juntao will see you.
-It's about time.

697
01:00:42,064 --> 01:00:43,398
Stop it!

698
01:00:43,731 --> 01:00:45,065
Let me go!

699
01:00:57,499 --> 01:01:01,166
This is tight.
Ain't nothing like downstairs.

700
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:05,833
What's up, man?
What y'all watching?

701
01:01:11,867 --> 01:01:13,834
Where Juntao at?

702
01:01:16,468 --> 01:01:18,468
Why y'all so quiet?

703
01:01:23,802 --> 01:01:27,135
That was childish, man.
That wasn't even called for!

704
01:01:27,502 --> 01:01:30,702
Now I came down here
to see Juntao...

705
01:01:30,836 --> 01:01:32,469
'cause he told me
to come down here...

706
01:01:32,836 --> 01:01:35,170
'cause l'm his half-brother
from Beijing.

707
01:01:35,503 --> 01:01:38,503
Me and him got the same mama.
I'm Blackinese.

708
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:41,170
We all the same. Whoa.
Wait a minute.

709
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:43,170
OK, you gonna kill me?

710
01:01:43,504 --> 01:01:45,771
OK, put the gun down,
fight like a man.

711
01:01:46,104 --> 01:01:48,438
Fight me like a man. Shit!

712
01:01:49,104 --> 01:01:52,138
Anybody can shoot somebody.
That's what l'm talking about.

713
01:01:52,471 --> 01:01:55,705
Back. Give me some room.
You don't know who you messing with.

714
01:01:55,805 --> 01:01:57,772
I'm gonna knock that yellow...

715
01:02:01,272 --> 01:02:03,539
-Which one ofy'all kicked me?
-Me.

716
01:02:06,539 --> 01:02:08,940
OK. All right.

717
01:02:20,474 --> 01:02:23,141
Hold on. Let's talk about this.
Let's talk about this, man.

718
01:02:24,508 --> 01:02:26,475
No, no. What that mean?

719
01:02:26,841 --> 01:02:29,808
This is a misunderstanding.
Come on, let's pray about this.

720
01:02:31,508 --> 01:02:34,475
-FBl, huh?
-No, I ain't FBl.

721
01:02:34,842 --> 01:02:36,676
I'm a security guard,
I work at the mall.

722
01:02:37,009 --> 01:02:38,676
Now wipe yourself off.

723
01:02:40,009 --> 01:02:41,343
You're bleeding.

724
01:02:50,344 --> 01:02:53,311
Oh, hell no. He just playing.
He ain't mean that.

725
01:02:53,977 --> 01:02:55,611
He meant cut me loose.
Let me go.

726
01:02:57,544 --> 01:02:58,511
LAPD.

727
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:55,184
Watch out!

728
01:03:58,017 --> 01:03:59,351
Behind you.

729
01:04:05,451 --> 01:04:06,451
Freeze!

730
01:04:08,118 --> 01:04:10,018
We kicked y'all ass.

731
01:04:10,118 --> 01:04:12,785
All y'all.
Y'all got your ass kicked.

732
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,454
I'm gonna kill your ass.

733
01:05:00,457 --> 01:05:02,790
Lee! Over here, man!

734
01:05:17,658 --> 01:05:18,992
Is that my gun?

735
01:05:21,325 --> 01:05:23,226
-It is my gun.
-Let's go.

736
01:05:26,893 --> 01:05:29,293
Why you gotta drop
the goddamn badge?

737
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,960
Then you threw the gun
out ofthe window.

738
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,294
Come on, this way.

739
01:05:43,628 --> 01:05:46,628
I got everything under control.
Don't worry about nothing.

740
01:05:46,961 --> 01:05:48,962
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

741
01:05:49,295 --> 01:05:50,528
It's cool.

742
01:05:50,628 --> 01:05:53,195
Why am I not surprised
to find you here, Carter?

743
01:05:53,295 --> 01:05:56,629
Dan, I want these two back
at the consulate immediately.

744
01:05:59,296 --> 01:06:00,629
Let's take a ride, gentlemen.

745
01:06:16,164 --> 01:06:19,165
You better get your hand off me.
Hey, man, he with me.

746
01:06:25,832 --> 01:06:28,366
Just let me explain.
I'Il start from the top.

747
01:06:28,499 --> 01:06:31,166
We were making the drop.
Han was about to get her back...

748
01:06:31,499 --> 01:06:33,066
and you two screwed it up.

749
01:06:33,166 --> 01:06:35,833
What you talking about?
Didn't you hear what Lee said?

750
01:06:36,166 --> 01:06:38,400
Mr. Lee is on his way
to Hong Kong.

751
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:39,767
Now get out of here...

752
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:42,500
before I file obstruction charges
against you.

753
01:06:42,834 --> 01:06:44,500
We was about to solve the case.
All we need to do...

754
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:47,167
You're no longer
on this assignment, Carter.

755
01:06:47,834 --> 01:06:49,168
Case closed.

756
01:07:06,169 --> 01:07:08,503
-Consul Han!
-Sorry, sir.

757
01:07:11,170 --> 01:07:12,837
It was all my fault.

758
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:15,870
Lee would never do anything to
jeopardize your daughter's life.

759
01:07:16,204 --> 01:07:17,870
He loves your daughter.

760
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:20,537
It's a little too late
for apologies.

761
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:24,204
Consul... you have a call.

762
01:07:25,538 --> 01:07:26,871
We're ready.

763
01:07:28,205 --> 01:07:29,538
Pick it up.

764
01:07:32,872 --> 01:07:36,806
The ransom is now 70 million.
I will call with instructions.

765
01:07:36,872 --> 01:07:39,839
You deliver the money or pick up
the body ofyour daughter.

766
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:42,606
Please. You must understand.
What happened tonight was not...

767
01:07:47,607 --> 01:07:50,607
Soo Yung, please tell them
I wnll do whatever...

768
01:08:16,143 --> 01:08:17,810
Sorry, man.

769
01:08:18,477 --> 01:08:20,810
Be sorry for Soo Yung.

770
01:08:45,813 --> 01:08:48,480
No hard leads.
None.

771
01:08:50,813 --> 01:08:54,380
Listen, we're doing
all we can here, all right?

772
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:57,314
Tracing everything that's coming
into this compound.

773
01:08:57,447 --> 01:08:59,447
Excuse me, Consul.
You have a guest.

774
01:09:00,114 --> 01:09:02,114
Jack, let me get back to you.

775
01:09:10,348 --> 01:09:12,015
I'm sorry, my friend.

776
01:09:12,349 --> 01:09:14,349
I couldn't stand by
and do nothing.

777
01:09:28,717 --> 01:09:30,684
Hey! What's up, baby?

778
01:09:31,184 --> 01:09:33,817
Man, you got guts calling me.
I'm gonna hang up.

779
01:09:34,151 --> 01:09:36,018
Hey, wait a minute.
Don't hang up.

780
01:09:36,118 --> 01:09:38,451
You know what? You was right
about me.

781
01:09:38,785 --> 01:09:40,451
I'm sorry.

782
01:09:40,785 --> 01:09:42,685
-Are you in drugs?
-You was rnght.

783
01:09:42,818 --> 01:09:45,119
I was egotistic.
I was inconsiderate.

784
01:09:45,485 --> 01:09:47,119
I was self-centered.

785
01:09:47,485 --> 01:09:49,452
I ain't used to working
with partners...

786
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:51,786
but it ain't about me.
It's about the little girl.

787
01:09:51,886 --> 01:09:55,553
She gonna die without our help.
You understand what l'm saynng?

788
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:57,786
Not yet,
but keep talking.

789
01:09:57,886 --> 01:10:01,220
I think something big going down
tonight, all right?

790
01:10:01,553 --> 01:10:03,487
I need to find out
where the consul's gonna be.

791
01:10:03,554 --> 01:10:05,554
You thnnkyou can help me?

792
01:10:06,221 --> 01:10:09,221
-I'Il see what I can do.
-No. I don't need you to see.

793
01:10:09,554 --> 01:10:11,554
I need you to do it.
Can you do it?

794
01:10:13,888 --> 01:10:15,155
OK, Carter.

795
01:10:15,222 --> 01:10:16,888
One other thing.

796
01:10:17,888 --> 01:10:19,555
What color panties you got on?

797
01:10:27,789 --> 01:10:31,690
Consul Han, I wantyou to go
to the Chnnese expo as you planned.

798
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:33,823
Have the money
nn the upstanrs control room.

799
01:10:34,157 --> 01:10:35,690
Be sure to make
no more mnstakes.

800
01:10:35,824 --> 01:10:38,157
I understand that, but I want
to speak with my daughter!

801
01:10:59,059 --> 01:11:01,393
Excuse me, miss.
Who's the captain on this plane?

802
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:04,393
Look, it don't even matter.
You need to go up there...

803
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:06,793
tell the captain we got
a problem on the left side.

804
01:11:07,127 --> 01:11:09,694
Something wrong with the engine.
You need a new alternator.

805
01:11:09,794 --> 01:11:12,394
My supervisor said, 'Willy, go on
down there and fix that plane.

806
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:15,294
Don't let it leave
till I come down there.'

807
01:11:15,361 --> 01:11:17,394
I suggest you tell
the proper authorities...

808
01:11:17,728 --> 01:11:21,061
not to move this plane before
the FAA come here... Go on!

809
01:11:29,462 --> 01:11:32,796
-What are you doing here?
-Get your ass up. We got work to do.

810
01:11:33,463 --> 01:11:37,663
-Go away. I've disgraced myself.
-Lee, what about the little girl?

811
01:11:37,796 --> 01:11:40,330
Leave me alone. A man like you
could never understand.

812
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:42,997
-A man like me?
-Devoted only to yourself.

813
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:47,031
You're ashamed of being an officer.
You dishonor your father's name.

814
01:11:47,364 --> 01:11:49,298
You don't know anything
about my father.

815
01:11:49,364 --> 01:11:52,031
-You say your father is a legend.
-My father was a legend.

816
01:11:52,365 --> 01:11:55,032
He was killed making a routine
traffic stop in daylight...

817
01:11:55,365 --> 01:11:57,332
by some punk
who didn't want no ticket...

818
01:11:57,665 --> 01:12:00,665
when his partner was to get out of
the car and back him up, he didn't.

819
01:12:01,032 --> 01:12:04,332
My father was as devoted as you,
and now he's dead.

820
01:12:04,666 --> 01:12:08,299
For a traffic ticker and some punk?
What's the honor in that?

821
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:12,833
You believe your father
wasted his life, died for nothing?

822
01:12:14,833 --> 01:12:15,800
Prove me wrong.

823
01:12:19,167 --> 01:12:22,068
For 15 years until China
resumed control of Hong Kong...

824
01:12:22,201 --> 01:12:25,868
Juntao was the most powerful
crime lord in Southeast Asia.

825
01:12:26,535 --> 01:12:30,535
The British tried to close down
his operation, but we failed.

826
01:12:31,869 --> 01:12:33,535
But why the consul's daughter?

827
01:12:33,869 --> 01:12:35,802
Detective lnspector Lee
help me raid...

828
01:12:35,869 --> 01:12:38,536
every known asset
of Juntao's operation.

829
01:12:38,869 --> 01:12:41,803
We confiscated millions
in weapons and cash...

830
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:45,937
and a collection of Chinese art
unsurpassed in the world.

831
01:12:46,603 --> 01:12:50,270
Then Juntao disappeared.
No witnesses.

832
01:12:51,604 --> 01:12:54,204
Do you really think
he'Il kill the girl?

833
01:12:56,471 --> 01:13:00,805
My advice to you is...
pay the money.

834
01:13:16,473 --> 01:13:19,807
Consul, l'm going upstairs
to make the drop.

835
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:22,340
I want you to remain calm
as if nothing's wrong...

836
01:13:22,474 --> 01:13:25,807
and don't leave Agent Whitney's
side even for a moment.

837
01:13:26,174 --> 01:13:27,841
I understand.

838
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:24,946
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm Consul Han.

839
01:14:25,613 --> 01:14:29,280
On behalf ofthe People's Republic
of China, thank you for coming.

840
01:14:34,214 --> 01:14:38,181
I am pleased to present 5.000 years
of Chinese history and heritage...

841
01:14:38,848 --> 01:14:42,848
a collection which, until recently,
was thought to be lost forever.

842
01:14:43,182 --> 01:14:45,182
This some nice shit.

843
01:14:45,515 --> 01:14:47,849
That Buddha'd go good
in my bathroom.

844
01:14:48,516 --> 01:14:51,182
This is the history
of my country...

845
01:14:51,849 --> 01:14:54,549
priceless pieces
of Chinese culture.

846
01:14:54,883 --> 01:14:56,616
If anything gets damaged...

847
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:59,283
Ain't nothing gonna happen
to none ofthis stuff.

848
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:04,284
And now we can pass them on
to our children.

849
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:15,218
Pardon me.

850
01:15:21,552 --> 01:15:24,119
I seen that guy
at the Chinese restaurant.

851
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:26,819
Consul Han has been fighting flu
for the past few days...

852
01:15:27,186 --> 01:15:29,820
so perhaps I should finish
what he started.

853
01:15:30,186 --> 01:15:32,153
The first thing we gotta do
is clear out this riffraff.

854
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,487
If anybody stay behind,
they got something to lose.

855
01:15:34,853 --> 01:15:36,187
I'Il be right back.

856
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:39,554
...future between
our two countries.

857
01:15:40,221 --> 01:15:42,221
The more we see
the differences...

858
01:15:44,221 --> 01:15:46,221
-Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.
-Goddamn it.

859
01:15:46,555 --> 01:15:49,222
-I'm Detective Carter from the LAPD.
-Russ, we got Carter down here.

860
01:15:51,222 --> 01:15:53,222
-What the hell's going on?
-We have just received...

861
01:15:53,555 --> 01:15:56,522
a threat on the building.
Please exit the building...

862
01:15:56,856 --> 01:15:59,489
as soon as possible,
and please do not panic.

863
01:16:01,523 --> 01:16:03,856
Didn't you hear what I said?
Get your shit and go out!

864
01:16:04,523 --> 01:16:06,057
There's a bomb in the building!

865
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:08,857
I don't believe this.
Agents, hold your positions!

866
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:11,190
Everybody take care,
but hold your positions.

867
01:16:11,824 --> 01:16:13,524
Get your old ass
out the building!

868
01:16:15,491 --> 01:16:18,825
Woman, the exit over there.
Gonna get your head blowed off!

869
01:16:21,525 --> 01:16:24,125
Titty, titty...
Get them titties outta here.

870
01:16:24,192 --> 01:16:25,859
Will somebody grab Carter?

871
01:16:40,693 --> 01:16:45,027
Consul Han, six blocks of C4 are wired
to your daughter in a car outside.

872
01:16:50,361 --> 01:16:52,695
Before the changeover,
most ofthis exhibition...

873
01:16:53,028 --> 01:16:55,695
was in the hands of a single
private collector.

874
01:16:57,295 --> 01:16:58,295
Me.

875
01:16:58,962 --> 01:17:01,896
I worked most of my life
to acquire and catalog...

876
01:17:02,296 --> 01:17:05,296
these priceless pieces
that you see before you.

877
01:17:06,963 --> 01:17:11,296
And then, in one fell swoop,
it was taken away from me.

878
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:16,297
But tonight,
I shall be paid in full.

879
01:17:16,964 --> 01:17:18,631
Don't move.

880
01:17:19,631 --> 01:17:21,964
She dies if I press this button.

881
01:17:24,631 --> 01:17:26,298
Just be patient.

882
01:17:26,631 --> 01:17:28,965
My transportation
will be here shortly.

883
01:17:32,599 --> 01:17:33,899
Stay calm.

884
01:17:45,567 --> 01:17:49,300
I was just gonna tell you
you was in a read zone.

885
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:55,268
You didn't know I could do that.
Put your hands up!

886
01:17:55,534 --> 01:17:58,501
I ain't gonna kill you this time.
I'm just gonna kick your ass!

887
01:18:03,502 --> 01:18:05,835
You tell your friends about me.

888
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:20,170
Hey, how you doing?

889
01:18:20,837 --> 01:18:23,504
We've been looking for you.
I'm Detective Carter, LAPD.

890
01:18:23,837 --> 01:18:26,437
Everything is OK now.
I'Il take you to your daddy.

891
01:18:26,771 --> 01:18:29,104
And first thing l'm gonna do
is take this vest offyou.

892
01:18:29,438 --> 01:18:32,138
-Don't touch it!
-It'Il be safer ifwe take it off.

893
01:18:32,471 --> 01:18:35,805
No. I heard them say
it will explode.

894
01:18:36,172 --> 01:18:39,805
I think it'Il be safer
ifwe leave it on. Don't move.

895
01:18:40,505 --> 01:18:41,472
Where are you?

896
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:50,340
-Don't move!
-Hold your positions, goddamn it!

897
01:18:50,473 --> 01:18:52,473
Do not draw your weapons.

898
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,707
Ladies and gentlemen...

899
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:00,041
I think we'Il call that
an evening.

900
01:19:00,374 --> 01:19:03,041
Thank you and good night.

901
01:19:28,877 --> 01:19:30,544
I got something for you!

902
01:19:31,844 --> 01:19:33,844
Got something you want.

903
01:19:39,145 --> 01:19:40,811
I got your bomb right here.

904
01:19:46,512 --> 01:19:48,479
Want to blow something up?

905
01:19:48,846 --> 01:19:50,512
Come on.

906
01:19:51,846 --> 01:19:53,846
Push the button. Come on.

907
01:19:55,513 --> 01:19:57,880
-Push the button.
-What are you doing?

908
01:19:58,213 --> 01:20:00,213
Just play along.
Come on, push the button.

909
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:03,280
Yeah, come on, push the button.

910
01:20:05,281 --> 01:20:07,947
-Blow everybody up.
-Yeah, blow everybody up!

911
01:20:08,281 --> 01:20:10,281
Push the goddamn button!

912
01:20:11,948 --> 01:20:13,948
You heard what she said.

913
01:20:15,282 --> 01:20:18,615
You got everybody excited about
something being blowed up...

914
01:20:18,949 --> 01:20:20,949
and look at your
little punk British ass.

915
01:20:21,549 --> 01:20:23,049
Push the button!

916
01:20:24,149 --> 01:20:26,116
-Deal with it, please.
-Where you going?

917
01:20:33,817 --> 01:20:35,817
Cover the consul!

918
01:20:37,517 --> 01:20:41,484
It's OK. She's a professional.
You must take the vest off.

919
01:20:41,551 --> 01:20:43,551
Just give me a second.

920
01:20:46,885 --> 01:20:51,218
There's a trigger on this vest.
It'Il blow if I take it off.

921
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,186
Haven't you done this before?

922
01:20:59,519 --> 01:21:01,720
It's a little different
in the practice room.

923
01:21:01,853 --> 01:21:05,187
-Everybody take cover.
-We need more men down here.

924
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:08,187
Say again. Dan, do you read...

925
01:21:21,455 --> 01:21:22,888
Need some help
down here, damn it!

926
01:21:29,689 --> 01:21:31,322
Roses are red...

927
01:21:32,689 --> 01:21:34,356
violets are blue.

928
01:21:36,356 --> 01:21:38,023
Sugar is sweet...

929
01:21:40,690 --> 01:21:42,024
and so are you.

930
01:21:50,624 --> 01:21:52,958
The remote can still set if off.

931
01:21:53,958 --> 01:21:55,625
Get rid of it.

932
01:22:01,859 --> 01:22:03,192
-She OK?
-Yes.

933
01:22:05,826 --> 01:22:07,859
I know that ain't the bomb.

934
01:22:08,193 --> 01:22:11,860
Take that bomb away from me!
Take the bomb outside.

935
01:22:15,527 --> 01:22:18,527
-Take it over to Juntao.
-Go that way, I go that way.

936
01:22:26,861 --> 01:22:28,195
Don't shoot!

937
01:23:55,704 --> 01:23:57,204
Where are you going?

938
01:24:17,772 --> 01:24:20,373
-Meet me on the roof.
-Roger.

939
01:24:43,275 --> 01:24:44,942
Don't move, man!

940
01:24:46,275 --> 01:24:49,842
I been looking for your
sweet-and-sour chicken ass.

941
01:24:49,942 --> 01:24:52,943
Your boys ain't here now.
You all alone.

942
01:24:53,609 --> 01:24:55,610
-I kill him.
-Go ahead.

943
01:24:56,210 --> 01:24:58,210
I don't even like him.

944
01:25:01,944 --> 01:25:05,211
Put your gun down.
Fight like a man.

945
01:25:07,177 --> 01:25:09,511
-What you say?
-Fight like a man.

946
01:25:11,211 --> 01:25:12,545
Fight like a man?

947
01:25:14,211 --> 01:25:16,812
All right,
l'm gonna kick your ass.

948
01:25:16,878 --> 01:25:18,879
Then l'm gonna
take your ass to jail.

949
01:25:19,212 --> 01:25:22,179
All right, come on,
put the gun down...

950
01:25:22,846 --> 01:25:24,512
same time.

951
01:25:48,482 --> 01:25:50,782
Wipe yourself off, man.
You're dead.

952
01:27:03,056 --> 01:27:04,389
Thank you, God.

953
01:27:30,058 --> 01:27:31,392
Oh, shit.

954
01:27:53,461 --> 01:27:54,827
You know he dead.

955
01:27:56,694 --> 01:27:59,028
Help! Do something!

956
01:27:59,695 --> 01:28:03,028
Hey, be cool, man!
Hang on!

957
01:28:08,462 --> 01:28:10,129
I can't hold on anymore!

958
01:28:10,462 --> 01:28:12,996
Hang on for about an hour.
I'm gonna get the ambulance.

959
01:28:13,129 --> 01:28:15,663
-What are you doing?
-I'Il be right back.

960
01:28:15,796 --> 01:28:18,130
-Carter!
-I was just playing.

961
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:25,064
Do something!

962
01:28:28,698 --> 01:28:30,698
I can't hold on anymore!

963
01:28:49,166 --> 01:28:50,500
Oh, shit!

964
01:28:55,167 --> 01:28:56,434
Thank you!

965
01:28:57,134 --> 01:29:00,801
-What the hell you doing?
-I was just being polite.

966
01:29:01,501 --> 01:29:03,701
Next time,
be polite to my nuts.

967
01:29:03,834 --> 01:29:05,168
I'm sorry.

968
01:29:05,835 --> 01:29:07,168
Thank you.

969
01:29:22,003 --> 01:29:24,003
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

970
01:29:25,003 --> 01:29:28,670
-I owe you everything.
-Only your friendship.

971
01:29:33,671 --> 01:29:34,971
Look who's here.

972
01:29:35,638 --> 01:29:37,604
What took you so long?

973
01:29:43,305 --> 01:29:45,305
I think this belongs to you.

974
01:29:56,540 --> 01:29:58,173
I think you should come with me.

975
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:00,873
Get on the plane when
you get offwork. You fly for free.

976
01:30:01,207 --> 01:30:05,274
I'm trying to expand my horizons.
Travel a little bit.

977
01:30:12,275 --> 01:30:15,175
I'm through with y'all, man.
I'm going on vacation.

978
01:30:15,275 --> 01:30:18,208
Now, hold on there.
We were just coming by...

979
01:30:18,308 --> 01:30:20,842
to tell you what a great job
you did yesterday.

980
01:30:20,942 --> 01:30:22,609
And when you come back...

981
01:30:22,942 --> 01:30:24,942
there's gonna be
an FBI badge waiting for you.

982
01:30:26,543 --> 01:30:27,876
You serious?

983
01:30:28,876 --> 01:30:30,543
Come on, don't be playing.

984
01:30:31,877 --> 01:30:34,877
I don't know what to say.
It's like a dream come true.

985
01:30:35,877 --> 01:30:37,210
I got an idea, though.

986
01:30:38,611 --> 01:30:41,211
Why don't y'all
take that badge...

987
01:30:42,944 --> 01:30:47,945
and shove it up your ass?
All up your ass. I'm LAPD.

988
01:30:51,979 --> 01:30:52,979
Bitch.

989
01:30:55,979 --> 01:30:57,646
First class. I like this.
This is tight.

990
01:30:58,312 --> 01:31:00,846
-Can I take yourjacket, sir?
-Myjacket? No.

991
01:31:00,979 --> 01:31:04,646
You can take this bag, though.
How you doing? What's up?

992
01:31:05,313 --> 01:31:07,647
What's up, man?
You ready to go?

993
01:31:08,313 --> 01:31:10,314
May I offer you some peanuts?

994
01:31:15,881 --> 01:31:17,881
You never told me
you spoke Chinese.

995
01:31:18,214 --> 01:31:20,881
I never told you I didn't.
You assumed I didn't.

996
01:31:21,548 --> 01:31:24,482
This is cool. Han letting me
go to Hong Kong with you.

997
01:31:24,548 --> 01:31:26,549
I ain't been on vacation
in five years.

998
01:31:26,949 --> 01:31:29,549
We can hang in my crib.
