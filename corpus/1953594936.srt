1
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:04,434
ah! detention. boring.

2
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,769
i can think of a few things
we can do

3
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,521
to kill some time.

4
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,189
brad, baby, you remember

5
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,566
this is what got us into
detention in the first place.

6
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:14,444
you only got me for three more
months till graduation.

7
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,447
and it's off to boot camp
before officer training.

8
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,242
i know, bradikins,
it's just...

9
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,577
i'm just saying,
that was the time

10
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:24,288
to show your suppport
for our troops.

11
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,331
you do...support...

12
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,791
our troops.

13
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,168
i do, it's...

14
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,484
hi, janet.

15
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,612
brad.

16
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,864
i didn't know
you'd be in detention.

17
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,241
what ev.

18
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,831
i saw you got a "d"
on the calc test.

19
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,584
yeah, well, mr. corbin
is a sexist.

20
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:16,381
i'm sure. anyway, i thought,
maybe, i don't know...

21
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,799
i could tutor you.

22
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,973
hey, ed, remember how i like
to hang out with you?

23
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:51,667
oops.

24
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:02,719
hell, yeah.

25
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:48,599
shit.

26
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,272
hey.

27
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:02,654
yo.

28
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,031
you got it?

29
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,575
doth the ashman ever fail you?

30
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,328
you're sure it won't pop
in a piss test?

31
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:12,414
100% untraceable.

32
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:15,501
dude, if marky mcg
had been popping these,

33
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,211
he could've run for congress

34
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,921
instead of lying
in front of them.

35
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:22,007
good. and you're sure
you can get more?

36
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,638
i've got the straight hook up.

37
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,973
wait. what's the m for?

38
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,476
um...

39
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:40,317
uh, midalithamethamine.

40
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,319
that's uh, its clinical name.

41
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,655
hey, i've heard of that.

42
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,824
smart guy.

43
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,683
uh, edster. did you come
to visit me in the big d?

44
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,981
uh, no, i got detention, too.

45
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,983
no way. you got detention?

46
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,693
now when your mom accuses me
of being a bad influence,

47
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:25,320
she actually has a leg
to stand on.

48
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,572
uh, yeah.

49
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:30,909
can the ashman interest you
in his other wears?

50
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,745
grade a. called blue sky.

51
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:37,124
and trust me,
it will get you soaring.

52
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,044
yeah.

53
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,713
no. no go, dude.

54
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,715
this body's a temple.

55
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,383
there's no way i'm polluting it
with that shit.

56
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,635
check it.

57
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,638
i tell you, edster, if i ever
meet george romero,

58
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,933
i'm gonna seduce him and bear
him little zombie babies.

59
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,143
but then they would
probably eat us

60
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,394
which would be kind of sad

61
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:00,355
because that means no more
living dead movies.

62
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,899
but it would be a great metaphor

63
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,025
for what kids end up doing
to their parents

64
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:05,652
when they turn into teenagers.
right, ed?

65
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,627
mrs. rumblethorp?

66
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:22,753
eddie.

67
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,838
i was wondering
if you decided yet

68
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,049
about telling principal mcmann.

69
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:31,887
marksamus! mi amigo.
how doth it hang?

70
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,932
oh, whoa, bro, you ok?

71
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:36,767
it's my hand.

72
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,852
some crazy bum bit me
out in the parking lot.

73
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:43,607
i'm sorry. i don't think
i can just ignore this.

74
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:46,151
what you did is serious.

75
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,111
it's illegal.
not to mention dangerous.

76
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,990
you can't tell him because
this is my chance.

77
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,033
it's harvard.

78
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,160
well, here, let dr. ash
take a look.

79
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,829
i got the cure
for what ails you. here.

80
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,878
oh, whoa, dude!

81
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,298
you got some legit
nurse visiting rights.

82
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,591
yo, mrs. rumbles!

83
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,135
ms. ro, i think you should
check mark man's hand.

84
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,804
no, i told you...

85
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,055
marksamus.

86
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,473
for serious, hit the nurse.

87
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,475
for one thing, she's like
10 times hotter than rumbles.

88
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,693
mrs. rumbles!

89
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:28,944
that dude's totally got rabies.

90
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,988
you don't go rabid
in a couple of hours.

91
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:33,657
ok, back up, everyone.

92
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,492
uh, mrs. rumblethorp...

93
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,831
help her!

94
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:43,500
he's strangling her!

95
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,169
on the count of 3.

96
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,503
he's not letting go.

97
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:47,838
1, 2, 3!

98
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,974
my uniform!

99
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,601
jesus christ, she's like
bleeding to death,

100
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,060
and you're worried
about your uniform?

101
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,689
it's blood. do you know
how hard blood is to get out?

102
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:06,815
guys!

103
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,193
i think marksamus is dead zone.

104
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:10,986
uh, i'm gonna get help.

105
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,738
willow, we need something
to stop the bleeding.

106
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,114
this is dry clean only.

107
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,868
- hey!
- problem solved.

108
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,046
uh...guys?

109
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,090
come here!

110
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:53,237
what are they doing?

111
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:54,905
what kind of rabies is this?

112
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,577
it's not rabies.

113
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:04,289
they're zombies.

114
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:13,298
holy fucklestein!

115
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,967
oh, my god!
what are we gonna do!

116
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:15,968
i say we get the hell
out of here.

117
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:17,094
damn straight.

118
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,595
i don't think
that's a good idea.

119
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:19,847
- what?
- no, look, look, look!

120
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:22,015
the guy who bit mark
must have bit other kids.

121
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,810
if they turn into zombies
and bite other students,

122
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,728
you've got what you call

123
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,106
infinitely expanding
growth potential.
huh?

124
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:31,608
one zombie
equals many more zombies.

125
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:32,776
oh.

126
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,363
so we can't go out there.

127
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,781
we don't know how many more
could be out there.

128
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:38,949
they could be everywhere.

129
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,909
what are you saying, we should
stay here and hide?

130
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,747
mrs. rumblethorp,
you shouldn't be standing.

131
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,832
she's trying
to say something.

132
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,211
<i>oh, hey, you really need
to stop doing that.</i>

133
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,963
<i>it's even grossing me out.</i>

134
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,135
brad, baby.
what?

135
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,469
kill it.

136
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,139
why me? jim, you kill it.
i'll get the next one.

137
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,807
you're the one joining
the rotc.
so.

138
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:05,976
so go get all hoo-rah
on his ass.

139
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,825
sorry, but i think staying
in there is a bad idea.

140
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:22,993
agreed.

141
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,678
how long before she,
you know...

142
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,013
i don't know,
but we can't leave her.

143
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:26,223
uh, to the back, come on.
come on!

144
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,706
this is the future
of our american military?

145
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:54,251
i know. pretty soon even
the french will conquer us.

146
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,506
chuck? yeah, man, hit that shit.

147
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:16,940
shit.

148
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:21,862
i'll check
if principal mcmann is here.

149
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,364
babykins, you won't let them
hurt me, will you?

150
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,116
janet, babe, i have years
of military experience.

151
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,076
alright, they won't
lay a finger on you.

152
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,329
you have years
of military experience?

153
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:33,916
yeah. i've been paintballing
with my dad since i was 6.

154
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,299
principal mcmann?

155
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,426
oh, damn it!
i got nothing.

156
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,473
uh, i got nothing here.

157
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:50,849
yeah. me neither.

158
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,059
nor i.

159
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,560
me, too.

160
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,270
maybe all these, uh,
corpsicles

161
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,565
are creating some kind
of undead zone.

162
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,363
hey, lilly and ashley
are out there.

163
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:06,240
they are? well, open the door.
let them in.

164
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,242
they're a little busy
right now.

165
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:09,493
doing what?

166
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,289
eating rick bliscan.

167
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,124
what are you laughing at?

168
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:20,504
uh, well, when uh,
ashley and lilly were alive,

169
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:21,922
they were always talking about

170
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,131
who would get a piece of
rick's ass first.

171
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,299
so?

172
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,010
lilly won.

173
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:32,015
- oh, fuck.

174
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,851
that's not funny.

175
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:35,018
well, it's a little funny.

176
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:37,145
kind of cool.

177
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:40,357
no, no, no.
this is not cool.

178
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,359
i know you all
are raging freakazoids and all,

179
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:45,445
but even ones as far removed
from cooldom as you

180
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,655
should still understand

181
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:49,658
how much further from coolness
this situation is.

182
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:50,951
yeah.

183
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:08,427
janet, you should
really lighten up.

184
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:12,055
lighten up? no, this is
no time to lighten up.

185
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,557
if anything, we should all
be getting heavier.

186
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,100
well, maybe you should
stop upchucking

187
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,185
after every meal then.

188
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:20,230
hey! janet's right.
this is serious.

189
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,525
and serious times call for...
serious minds.

190
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,485
thank god we have you then.

191
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:30,532
was principal mcmann in there?

192
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,245
partly.

193
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:40,918
i don't want to die here.

194
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:42,085
ok.

195
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,545
this zombie shit

196
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:46,089
is really starting
to harsh my mellow, ok?

197
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,050
all right, look.

198
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,927
come on, you too, willow.
get in here.

199
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,473
all right, this school

200
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:57,142
is crawling with god knows
how many zomb-heads.

201
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:58,644
we need to find somewhere
to hold up.

202
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:02,105
and we need to fortify.

203
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,482
well, yeah, but everywhere
we go,

204
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:04,691
there's going to be
deadheads already there.

205
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,944
yeah, we need somewhere
no one goes to.

206
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:10,948
the library.

207
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:12,282
why would we go there?

208
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:17,621
it's perfect. one major entrance
and plenty of shelves

209
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:18,705
to barricade the door.

210
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,750
sounds easily
defendable.

211
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,085
yeah, and it's
right down the hall.

212
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:25,170
good. 'cause all this
running and shit

213
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,964
is tuckering the ashman out.

214
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:28,507
yeah, i don't think
mrs. rumblethorpe

215
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:30,133
can take much more
moving around.

216
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:39,351
most important...

217
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:40,978
yeah?

218
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:43,522
not a single student
in this school

219
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:45,607
would be caught dead there.

220
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:50,737
don't you mean caught...
undead there?

221
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,344
what do we do about that,
brainiac?

222
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:17,514
from the little observations
that i've been able to make,

223
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:21,852
zombies seem to be
uni-attentional. ok.
what?

224
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:24,605
zombies only pay attention to
what's right in front of them.

225
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:25,689
oh.

226
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:29,693
so, so if we don't draw
their attention...

227
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,778
we should just be able
to walk right by.

228
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:36,116
you go first.

229
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:54,444
way to go, edster!

230
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,828
this way!

231
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:08,375
downstairs. go! go!

232
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:16,550
hey! hey! come here!

233
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,220
come and get me!
come and get me!

234
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:24,474
hey! go, go, go!

235
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:26,518
come and get me!

236
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:27,644
come and get me.

237
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:33,483
come here.

238
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:40,782
- in the library!
- get the door! get the door!

239
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,951
go! go!

240
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:47,164
yeah!

241
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:48,499
aha!

242
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,296
yeah! hell, yeah!

243
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:13,273
jesus, eddie.

244
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,733
i know, i didn't think
that would actually work.

245
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:44,596
ok, she's not looking too good.

246
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:47,641
i can't believe
this is happening.

247
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:50,727
i am student council
vice president.

248
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,897
junior prom queen,
and head cheerleader,

249
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:55,732
and i have a serious problem

250
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,150
with the direction this school
is taking.

251
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,652
well, i'd adjust quickly
if i were you,

252
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:00,445
or the next popularity contest
you'll be winning

253
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:03,574
is most likely to get eaten
by the student body.

254
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:05,784
aah! oh!

255
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:10,372
again?

256
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:11,540
damn it, janet. help me.

257
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,251
what should i do?

258
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:17,462
here. hold her neck.
keep pressure on it.

259
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,965
eddie's been studying medical
school since like infancy,

260
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,550
so maybe he knows.

261
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:26,430
ew!

262
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:29,683
hey, what is it?

263
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:32,978
oh, nothing big.
just the end of the world.

264
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,666
ah! ah!

265
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:24,863
mrs. rumblethorp?

266
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:31,495
oh, please don't be dead.

267
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:34,998
please?

268
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:42,464
ok...

269
00:23:57,855 --> 00:24:01,859
ok...ok.

270
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,044
come on. janet!

271
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:29,511
bradikins. you saved me.

272
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,728
guys, help me!

273
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:41,607
whoa.

274
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:45,402
aah!

275
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:46,570
did she bite you?

276
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,155
no! i bent my finger weird.

277
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:49,740
i can't hold her much longer.

278
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,949
- her brain. her brain!
- what?

279
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,951
eddie's right, the only way
to kill a zombie

280
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:54,077
is destroy its brain.

281
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:57,498
that cuntress has been riding me
since i was a freshman.

282
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:03,086
it's time for some payback.

283
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:08,091
bring her to me.

284
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:07,150
how you like me now,
rumbly thumbly? hmm?

285
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:18,787
it looks like rob zombie

286
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:19,830
raped the entire cast
of gossip girl

287
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,832
and this is their angry
love child.

288
00:26:21,832 --> 00:26:23,750
and who knows what it's
like everywhere else.

289
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,671
tried the land lines.
nothing.

290
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:31,175
so we're completely cutoff
from the rest of the world?

291
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:32,176
what about the internet?

292
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:34,511
none of our phones
can get a signal.

293
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:38,015
school computer?

294
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:40,559
really?

295
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,102
that thing's so ancient

296
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:43,645
it makes old tron
look cutting edge.

297
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:45,731
it's worth a try, ok?

298
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:47,608
you know, maybe we can
email for help.

299
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:51,195
or tweet. omg, zombies
attacking the school.

300
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:52,738
send help pronto.

301
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:09,046
here goes nothing.

302
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:27,022
this might take awhile.

303
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:28,273
well, if this isn't
a commentary

304
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:29,942
on the current state
of public education,

305
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:31,568
i don't know what is.

306
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:43,997
yeah, that helps.

307
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:18,198
everything will be ok.

308
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:22,619
look at you.
you are way too hot to die.

309
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,316
like the werewolves
are to vampires,

310
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:54,318
or are you
team switzerland?

311
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:57,070
oh, yeah, me too, yeah.

312
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:39,488
um, hey, guys,
i think we have a problem

313
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:41,240
of incalculable proportion.

314
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,324
huh?

315
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:44,117
big problem.

316
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:45,702
<i>oh.</i>

317
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:46,995
are they getting in?

318
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:49,206
no, no, not yet, janet.
but they will.

319
00:29:49,206 --> 00:29:50,958
there's no way they're gonna
make it through the barricade.

320
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:55,379
their numbers are growing,
jimmy. they're gonna get in.

321
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:56,463
well, then i say
we run for it.

322
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:57,714
no, no, that's--

323
00:29:57,714 --> 00:29:58,757
yeah, he's right.

324
00:29:58,757 --> 00:29:59,967
all right, we make a run.

325
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:01,885
maybe someone out there
has a cure or something.

326
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:03,136
yeah, and go back out there?

327
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:05,722
yeah.
with them?

328
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:06,849
bradikins, baby,

329
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:08,392
i can't do it. i can't.

330
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:09,768
ok, look.

331
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:11,478
i've seen about every zombie
movie there is,

332
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:12,938
and one internal truth
in all of them

333
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:14,439
is that going outside
equals bad.

334
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:16,024
- exactly.
- i say we run for it.

335
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:18,819
and outrun the high school
of the damned.

336
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:19,945
look, from what i've seen,

337
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:21,238
i don't need to outrun
one of them.

338
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:22,739
i need to outrun one of you.

339
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:24,908
and i'm pretty damned sure
i can beat asthma boy here.

340
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:28,120
i don't have asthma.
not all dorky kids have asthma.

341
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,082
yeah, look, we make a run.
right, some of us will make it.

342
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:33,250
look at her.

343
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,377
she's got big-ass boots on.
she can't run.

344
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:38,380
survival of the fittest.
hoo-rah.

345
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,424
i breathe just fine. thank you.

346
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:43,135
oh, bradikins, i can't
go out there and compete.

347
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:44,428
i play sports.

348
00:30:44,428 --> 00:30:46,430
i'm totally ok with the current
living situation.

349
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,764
i'm just saying.

350
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:49,558
i bowl. i'm a bowler.
i'm an excellent bowler.

351
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:52,102
eddie, focus, come on.
focus, please.

352
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:54,771
sorry. right, sorry. jimmy.

353
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:57,858
jimmy, your plan only works
if we all agree to go out there,

354
00:30:57,858 --> 00:31:00,277
and clearly there is a large
dissenting opinion

355
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:01,778
that plans just stay put.

356
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:02,946
like me.

357
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:04,781
and me. brad, babe...

358
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:06,742
you won't leave me here,
will you?

359
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:11,455
we stay.

360
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:12,789
come on!

361
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:17,961
oh, you guys seriously
need to chillax.

362
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:19,922
chillax?

363
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:22,049
yeah. look on the bright side.

364
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:25,511
bright side? the school
is overrun with zombies.

365
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:26,803
what's the bright side?

366
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:30,390
when else do you get to
decapitate your english teacher

367
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,477
and then continue to torment
her undead head?

368
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:36,104
right, mrs. rummy thumber?

369
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:42,361
oh! no biting! that's a bad
mrs. rumbly thumbly. huh?

370
00:31:42,361 --> 00:31:44,071
detention for you!

371
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:46,865
ash! stop taunting the undead.

372
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:49,201
all right.

373
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:51,995
all right, look. i got it.

374
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:53,997
if we're going to stay,

375
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:56,250
we need to treat this
like a siege situation.

376
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,918
our greatest danger is lying

377
00:31:57,918 --> 00:31:59,503
either a frontal breach
of our defenses,

378
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:01,463
or a small scale incursion

379
00:32:01,463 --> 00:32:04,049
via an as yet unrecognized
weak point.

380
00:32:07,511 --> 00:32:08,887
we do some recon.

381
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:27,281
eddie, you're
a book geek, right?

382
00:32:29,158 --> 00:32:30,367
you know how to look stuff up
and shit?

383
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:32,119
sure.

384
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:34,204
maybe there's something in here
that can help.

385
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:38,542
zombie stuff, like a how-to
survive a zombie attack.

386
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:40,210
or what to do if bitten.

387
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,629
this is a high school library,

388
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:44,214
so i'm not sure there's
a lot of reference material

389
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:45,382
on zombies.

390
00:32:45,382 --> 00:32:47,342
yeah, too bad this isn't
the library

391
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:48,635
from buffy the vampire slayer

392
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:50,387
cause they had a wicked
dark art selection.

393
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:55,392
what?

394
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:57,561
i liked the two gay witches.

395
00:32:57,561 --> 00:32:59,104
wicked chicks are hot.

396
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:04,234
ow.

397
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:29,218
damn it! there's gotta be
something, right?

398
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:31,345
sorry, but when it comes
to living dead,

399
00:33:31,345 --> 00:33:33,430
your best source of info
is right in front of you.

400
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:36,391
between eddie and i,
we've seen about every movie,

401
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:38,310
read every comic book
and played every video game

402
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,937
that has anything to do
with zombies.

403
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:41,313
yeah, that's right.

404
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:44,441
when it comes to zombie
survival, we're the bad asses.

405
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:48,445
fine. eddie, willow, you'll act
as our intelligence--

406
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:02,501
well, that's in no way
ominous or forboding.

407
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:03,627
baby?

408
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:05,504
janet, babe, don't worry, ok?

409
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:07,965
i'll kill anything that
comes through the door.

410
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:13,971
jimmy!

411
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:17,474
jimmy!

412
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:23,981
oh, man, no!

413
00:34:27,276 --> 00:34:31,989
jimmy...hey. hang in there.

414
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:33,240
i don't feel so good.

415
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,575
all right.
i'll give you some air.

416
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:43,417
hang in there.

417
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,505
this is not
getting us anywhere.

418
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:00,809
stay there!

419
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,198
ugh.

420
00:35:23,373 --> 00:35:24,541
whoa.

421
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:33,717
i mean we can't
just leave him there.

422
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:35,302
he's gonna turn.

423
00:35:36,762 --> 00:35:40,057
hey, we all saw what happened
to mrs. rumblethorp.

424
00:35:40,057 --> 00:35:43,310
so, what? you want to throw him
out the window?

425
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,728
it's jimmy for christ sakes.

426
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:47,272
not for long, bro.

427
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:53,403
brad, baby, they're right.
you know they're right.

428
00:35:56,073 --> 00:35:57,241
ah, fuck.

429
00:35:57,241 --> 00:35:58,408
brad.

430
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:03,580
jimmy.

431
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:09,253
hoo-rah.

432
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:23,642
no!

433
00:36:27,104 --> 00:36:29,523
hoo-rah...

434
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:55,632
we're all gonna die.

435
00:36:58,135 --> 00:37:01,346
we're all gonna die!

436
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:03,182
we're all gonna die.

437
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:10,522
janet, it's gonna be ok.
we're gonna be ok.

438
00:37:10,522 --> 00:37:14,485
we're gonna be ok.

439
00:37:14,485 --> 00:37:17,821
uh, um, group hug.

440
00:37:26,163 --> 00:37:27,372
thanks, guys.

441
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,751
i'm ok now.

442
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,525
wonder what caused all this.

443
00:37:56,193 --> 00:37:57,361
nuclear fallout?

444
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:02,991
military super soldier
experiments.

445
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:04,409
meteors.

446
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:07,204
biological weapons.

447
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:09,331
aliens.

448
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:10,707
diseased monkeys.

449
00:38:15,254 --> 00:38:16,547
you know what i don't get?

450
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:20,342
mark. when he turned all
aberzombie and fitch,

451
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:23,387
he was still pretty fast.

452
00:38:23,387 --> 00:38:29,393
but marion the zombrarian
was all slow and stumbly.

453
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:30,894
clearly each zombie retains

454
00:38:30,894 --> 00:38:32,396
some of their physical
attributes

455
00:38:32,396 --> 00:38:33,730
from when they were alive.

456
00:38:46,577 --> 00:38:48,787
all right. enough.

457
00:38:50,414 --> 00:38:51,540
enough.

458
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,834
we all seriously
need to chillax

459
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:55,544
before someone pops
a blood vessel.

460
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:57,921
chillax? what the fuck
is chillax?

461
00:38:57,921 --> 00:39:00,966
chill. and relax.

462
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:04,386
when the powers combine,
chillax.

463
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:06,638
whatever.

464
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:09,641
all i'm saying is i think
it's time

465
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:10,976
to intro a little...

466
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:13,937
mellow.

467
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:16,773
hmm? hmm? hmm?

468
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:18,609
to this pity party.

469
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:21,695
sweet. share the wealth.

470
00:39:22,821 --> 00:39:25,657
as the lady dark doth command.

471
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:28,076
wait, is that marijuana pot?

472
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:29,703
something like that.

473
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:32,039
i don't think this is the time
to be getting high.

474
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:34,708
i need something
to calm my nerves.

475
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:39,963
what say you, bradtasm?

476
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:44,051
yeah, fuck it.
for medicinal purposes.

477
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:49,765
secondhand smoke?

478
00:39:49,765 --> 00:39:51,642
won't the zombies
get the munchies?

479
00:39:51,642 --> 00:39:53,310
ed, they already have them.

480
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,478
fine.

481
00:39:54,478 --> 00:39:56,772
smoking weed equals death.

482
00:39:56,772 --> 00:39:57,814
what?

483
00:39:57,814 --> 00:39:59,066
in the movies,

484
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:02,569
smoking the weed equals death.

485
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:04,488
drinking equals death.

486
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:06,448
having sex equals death.

487
00:40:06,448 --> 00:40:10,994
basically having fun in any way
will get you killed.

488
00:40:10,994 --> 00:40:14,873
right. horror movies
are total

489
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:17,876
moral righty conservative
propaganda bullshit.

490
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:19,127
tell me about it.

491
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:21,755
i've never been so happy
to be a virgin.

492
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:24,466
what?

493
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:25,926
i'm waiting for the right girl.

494
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:27,845
uh, sure, if by the right girl

495
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:29,763
you mean someone lame enough
to sleep with your ass.

496
00:40:29,763 --> 00:40:31,890
no, no. i mean...

497
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:41,817
yeah, whatever.

498
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:44,528
high school sucks.

499
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,496
just do it.

500
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:02,171
oh...

501
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:12,472
what was that?
what is it?

502
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:32,409
oh...

503
00:41:34,411 --> 00:41:35,621
he was enjoying it, too.

504
00:41:44,755 --> 00:41:47,883
ugh!

505
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,430
uh, me and uh,
pale tits mistress

506
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,474

detention, but um,

508
00:42:00,604 --> 00:42:01,855
what the hell
are you three doing here?

509
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:03,982
nothing.

510
00:42:03,982 --> 00:42:05,776
oh, come on.

511
00:42:05,776 --> 00:42:10,113

dungeons and dragons geek

512
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:11,949

513
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:12,950
i'm a paladin.

514
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,451
what?

515
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:17,579
wizards are for spazzes
and losers.

516
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:18,664
right.right.

517
00:42:23,627 --> 00:42:25,629
so what about you,
sweet cheeks?

518
00:42:25,629 --> 00:42:26,964
oh.

00:42:26,964 --> 00:42:29,591
well, nothing. we were just
caught in the bathroom.

520
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:31,969
what were you guys doing
in the bathroom?

521
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:37,891
are you...in the bathroom?
that's gross.

522
00:42:40,686 --> 00:42:41,770

00:42:48,986 --> 00:42:50,195
oh, get off it, janet.

00:42:51,488 --> 00:42:53,073

529
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:54,158

00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:10,674

535
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:12,176
pretty much.

536
00:43:21,018 --> 00:43:22,060
you don't get it.

537
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,646
no one does.

538
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:25,689

539
00:43:25,689 --> 00:43:27,858
how hard it is to be me.

540
00:43:27,858 --> 00:43:29,693
oh, please.

541
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:31,904
there's so much pressure
that comes with being popular.

542
00:43:31,904 --> 00:43:37,534
everything i do,
everything i wear is judged.

543
00:43:37,534 --> 00:43:38,785
by everyone.

544
00:43:38,785 --> 00:43:40,662
oh, poor you.

545
00:43:40,704 --> 00:43:43,832
i always have to say
the right thing,

546
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:46,210
wear the newest clothes,
date the coolest guy.

547
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,214
and in the end,
you all still hate me.

548
00:43:50,214 --> 00:43:51,548
we don't hate you.

549
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:54,801
yes, you do.

550
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:56,678
you social rejects hate me
because i'm popular.

551
00:43:56,678 --> 00:43:59,806
and the popular kids hate me
because...

552
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:01,016
i'm more popular than them.

553
00:44:01,016 --> 00:44:03,936
well, if being popular
is so rough,

554
00:44:03,936 --> 00:44:06,146
then why don't you,

555
00:44:06,146 --> 00:44:09,358
i don't know, stop trying
to be the queen bee.

556
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:14,238
that's easy for you to say.
you've never been popular.

557
00:44:26,959 --> 00:44:28,252
you're not the only one

558
00:44:28,252 --> 00:44:32,130
whose felt uh, so trapped
by who they are.

559
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,926
that they did something stupid.

560
00:44:35,926 --> 00:44:37,803
really, really stupid.

561
00:44:41,932 --> 00:44:43,058
holy shit.

562
00:44:43,058 --> 00:44:44,268
where'd you get a gun?

563
00:44:44,268 --> 00:44:46,353
you were gonna columbine us?

564
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,065
i wasn't gonna columbine you.

565
00:44:51,608 --> 00:44:52,776
the gun is for me.

566
00:44:52,776 --> 00:44:54,194
you were gonna off yourself
in detention?

567
00:44:58,073 --> 00:44:59,992
is this because
i make fun of you?

568
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:01,285
no.

569
00:45:03,245 --> 00:45:05,747
is it because i didn't
go to prom with you?

570
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:09,293
what? no. i didn't even
ask you to prom.

571
00:45:12,629 --> 00:45:13,714
it's because of her.

572
00:45:18,802 --> 00:45:21,847
i thought you and the rumbles

573
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:23,932
were all apt pupilage
and whatnot.

574
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:27,811
yeah, we were, till she
found these.

575
00:45:32,149 --> 00:45:33,233
adderall?

576
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:36,153
i was just using adderall
to help me study.

577
00:45:36,153 --> 00:45:38,322
mrs. rumblethorp
just caught me.

578
00:45:38,322 --> 00:45:41,116
and they weren't
prescribed to me. per se.

579
00:45:41,116 --> 00:45:42,659
so you were riding
the adderall train

580
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:43,911
to ivy league town.

581
00:45:45,704 --> 00:45:48,332
yeah. i got into harvard.

582
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:54,922
i studied my butt off
to get out of this shit hole.

583
00:45:54,922 --> 00:45:58,342
to get into somewhere where i
wasn't put in a urinal

584
00:45:58,342 --> 00:46:00,093
for wanting to learn.

585
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:03,931
that's why i'm in detention.

586
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:08,268
and look, i want to live.

587
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:09,978
i want to live through this.

588
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,357
but to do that,
we'd need to work together.

589
00:46:13,357 --> 00:46:17,152
we'd need to put all our petty,
stupid self interests aside

590
00:46:17,152 --> 00:46:20,364
and work for the greater good.

591
00:46:20,364 --> 00:46:23,367
well, this is high school,
so fat chance.

592
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:25,953
damn it, ash,
this isn't a joke!

593
00:46:25,953 --> 00:46:28,121
two hours ago,
she's running detention

594
00:46:28,121 --> 00:46:30,332
and accusing you
of smoking out.

595
00:46:30,332 --> 00:46:32,751
i fail to see the difference,
eddie.

596
00:46:32,751 --> 00:46:34,419
guys?

597
00:46:34,419 --> 00:46:35,462
look, edstser,

598
00:46:35,462 --> 00:46:36,964
there's one thing i know

599
00:46:36,964 --> 00:46:40,008
and it's when push
comes getting eaten,

600
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:45,389
it's every man, cheerleader,
meathead, dork,

601
00:46:45,389 --> 00:46:48,517
and scary yet
strangely attractive goth chick

602
00:46:48,517 --> 00:46:49,852
- for themselves.
- hey, guys...

603
00:46:49,893 --> 00:46:51,854
that's the attitude
that's gonna get us killed!

604
00:46:51,854 --> 00:46:53,897
dude, we're all
dead meat anyways.

605
00:46:53,897 --> 00:46:56,316
might as well
enjoy the ride, edster.

606
00:46:56,316 --> 00:46:57,442
guys!

607
00:47:03,073 --> 00:47:05,159
what?
listen.

608
00:47:37,357 --> 00:47:37,608
hit it!

609
00:47:41,445 --> 00:47:44,114
get it out of here!
get it out of here!

610
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:46,033
get it, eddie! get it!

611
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:47,784
get it out of here!
get it out of here!

612
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,043
you saved me.

613
00:47:59,296 --> 00:48:00,464
oh, my head.

614
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,475
what?

615
00:48:31,161 --> 00:48:33,121
what do i do? what do i do?

616
00:48:33,121 --> 00:48:35,374
pry its fingers off.

617
00:48:37,251 --> 00:48:38,627
stay still!

618
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,421
ah, screw that!

619
00:48:41,421 --> 00:48:43,841
relax. i got this.

620
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:45,384
janet, help me!

621
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,971
shoot it fast. shoot it!

622
00:48:48,971 --> 00:48:51,098
no, no, no! don't shoot it.

623
00:49:10,242 --> 00:49:12,119
oh, my god.

624
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:14,872
oh, i got you, ed!

625
00:49:14,872 --> 00:49:16,623
i got you, ed.

626
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:20,961
ah...ah...ah...

627
00:49:36,226 --> 00:49:40,939
1...2...3...

628
00:50:00,918 --> 00:50:02,294
that was intense.

629
00:50:19,603 --> 00:50:21,188
what's the math say?

630
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:26,235
that the amount
of zombies out there,

631
00:50:26,276 --> 00:50:28,403
should they make
a concerted effort...

632
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:29,613
yeah?

633
00:50:29,613 --> 00:50:31,698
they'd break through
in about 35 seconds.

634
00:50:31,698 --> 00:50:34,993
so we're basically screwed.

635
00:50:34,993 --> 00:50:36,119
yeah.

636
00:50:48,131 --> 00:50:52,010
is that what you really want?

637
00:50:53,136 --> 00:50:54,096
yeah.

638
00:50:57,307 --> 00:50:58,475
what?

639
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:02,563
she's beautiful.

640
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:08,360
sexy. super popular.

641
00:51:11,155 --> 00:51:14,741
perky. not to mention perky.
i'm a big fan of perky.

642
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:21,165
you're just like
the rest of these idiots.

643
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:24,751
you were a bunch
of mindless

644
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:26,628
zombies
before any of this happened.

645
00:51:28,672 --> 00:51:31,675
trying so hard to fit into
their little clique.

646
00:51:31,675 --> 00:51:36,346
trying so hard to hide anything
that might make them stand out.

647
00:51:36,346 --> 00:51:37,556
i mean, god forbid

648
00:51:37,556 --> 00:51:39,349
we don't all fit into this
cookie cutter mold

649
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:41,185
that everyone puts us in.

650
00:51:44,021 --> 00:51:45,272
popular girl.

651
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:47,733
bully.

652
00:51:49,443 --> 00:51:50,652
stoner idiot.

653
00:51:52,529 --> 00:51:54,698
dorky loser.

654
00:51:54,698 --> 00:51:56,617
i'm not like them.

655
00:51:56,617 --> 00:51:58,160
sure you are.

656
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,372
you'd die for one night
with janet.

657
00:52:02,372 --> 00:52:05,584
not because you love her
or that you care for her.

658
00:52:05,584 --> 00:52:09,379
just because she's
what everybody tells you

659
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:10,589
you should strive for.

660
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:15,469
and you were going
to kill yourself last night.

661
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,722
why?

662
00:52:18,722 --> 00:52:20,307
because you weren't going to
get into harvard?

663
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:24,728
so what, eddie.

664
00:52:26,063 --> 00:52:28,357
does that mean your life
isn't worth living?

665
00:52:32,736 --> 00:52:34,071
you're right.

666
00:52:36,406 --> 00:52:38,367
maybe i need to...

667
00:52:41,078 --> 00:52:43,205
i don't know, grow up a bit.

668
00:52:43,247 --> 00:52:45,290
maybe we all do.

669
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:54,633
hey, if we live through this,
um...

670
00:52:56,093 --> 00:52:57,261
yeah?

671
00:52:57,261 --> 00:53:00,347
would you want to, you know...

672
00:53:05,853 --> 00:53:09,189
i mean, if you don't,
that's cool, i mean...

673
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:13,110
oh, no. i want, i, i uh...

674
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:14,236
i definitely want to.

675
00:53:19,908 --> 00:53:21,201
oh. cool.

676
00:53:22,452 --> 00:53:23,620
cool.

677
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:56,612
edster!

678
00:53:56,612 --> 00:53:57,738
uh...

679
00:53:57,738 --> 00:54:01,158
how long until the zombie horde
gets bored

680
00:54:01,158 --> 00:54:02,743
and scampers into the next
taco bell?

681
00:54:04,203 --> 00:54:06,830
i don't know. in the movies,
the horde never goes away.

682
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:08,165
it keeps getting bigger.

683
00:54:08,165 --> 00:54:10,876
and that's what makes it
a horde.

684
00:54:10,876 --> 00:54:14,463
well, we have a problem then.

685
00:54:14,505 --> 00:54:15,631
what?

686
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:16,882
le toilet.

687
00:54:16,882 --> 00:54:18,884
come on, man.
find a corner or something.

688
00:54:18,884 --> 00:54:21,428
oh, gross!

689
00:54:21,428 --> 00:54:22,554
oh, no go, man.

690
00:54:22,554 --> 00:54:24,598
i gotta take a deuce
from the caboose.

691
00:54:24,598 --> 00:54:26,391
i say we blow
this popsicle stand

692
00:54:26,391 --> 00:54:28,227
and make a pit stop
along the way.

693
00:54:28,227 --> 00:54:29,853
just hang your ass
out the window.

694
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:33,357
oh, no, so some zomb-head
can take a bite out of my ass?

695
00:54:33,357 --> 00:54:34,441
we're on the second floor.

696
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:35,609
zombies don't jump, idiot.

697
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:38,570
oh, screw that.
i watched shark week on tlc.

698
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:42,699
and if some great white can jump
20 feet out of the air

699
00:54:42,699 --> 00:54:45,410
to grab a tasty seagull
snackpack,

700
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:46,787
who's to say a zombie can't?

701
00:54:46,787 --> 00:54:49,331
well, there are major
logic flaws--

702
00:54:49,373 --> 00:54:50,499
no. ash is right.

703
00:54:50,499 --> 00:54:52,668
- he is?
- i am?

704
00:54:52,709 --> 00:54:56,630
yeah. no, not about
zombies jumping. that's stupid.

705
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:58,340
but we need to get
the hell out of here.

706
00:54:58,382 --> 00:54:59,424
we can't leave.

707
00:54:59,424 --> 00:55:01,969
the barricade's our only
protection.

708
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:03,220
i gotta go, man.

709
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:06,515
that means a trip
to the little boy's room.

710
00:55:06,557 --> 00:55:07,683
ed, you know,
maybe they're right.

711
00:55:07,724 --> 00:55:10,477
you said yourself
the barricade won't hold.

712
00:55:10,477 --> 00:55:11,937
maybe we should
make a run for it.

713
00:55:11,937 --> 00:55:14,565
i'm not going out there.

714
00:55:14,565 --> 00:55:18,569
brad, baby, you wouldn't
leave me, would you?

715
00:55:20,571 --> 00:55:23,031
i'm sorry, babe.

716
00:55:23,031 --> 00:55:24,700
come on, let's go.

717
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:25,868
no, you can't.
you can't go.

718
00:55:25,868 --> 00:55:26,994
if you start moving
things around,

719
00:55:26,994 --> 00:55:28,579
you're gonna draw them closer
to the door.

720
00:55:28,579 --> 00:55:29,788
hey, wait.

721
00:55:29,788 --> 00:55:31,039
what?

722
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:32,583
what if there's another way?

723
00:55:35,919 --> 00:55:37,671
what, are you gonna escape
through the vent shaft?

724
00:55:37,671 --> 00:55:40,340
no. i'm gonna send my little
sidekick ferret to go get help.

725
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,009
it'd be so cool
if that were true.

726
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:44,469
look at it this way,
this might be our only chance,

727
00:55:44,469 --> 00:55:46,889
and i for one would like to live
past this day.

728
00:55:46,889 --> 00:55:50,601
especially now that i have
something to look forward to.

729
00:55:50,601 --> 00:55:53,061
what if there's a zombie
in the shaft?

730
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:55,564
how's a zombie
gonna get in the shaft, eddie?

731
00:55:55,606 --> 00:55:57,065
i don't know. zombie rats?

732
00:55:57,065 --> 00:55:58,692
<i>like in house of the damned?</i>

733
00:55:58,692 --> 00:56:01,278
those fuckers
will eat your shit up.

734
00:56:01,278 --> 00:56:03,238
there's no fucking zombies
in the shaft, you guys.

735
00:56:03,238 --> 00:56:04,406
i'm going.

736
00:56:04,448 --> 00:56:07,868
me, too. ashbury needs
his porcelain throne.

737
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:11,955
ed, look, this might be
your only chance, ok?

738
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,416
well, i'm not going.

739
00:56:17,669 --> 00:56:19,922
isn't someone gonna stay here
with me?

740
00:56:22,299 --> 00:56:23,467
ed?

741
00:56:31,642 --> 00:56:33,393
i'm sorry, willow.

742
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:38,941
come on. let's get out of here.

743
00:56:38,941 --> 00:56:41,026
let's go.

744
00:56:41,026 --> 00:56:42,444
let's go.

745
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:25,028
um, do either of you
have any idea

746
00:57:25,028 --> 00:57:26,530
which direction
we should be going?

747
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:30,868
of course not.

748
00:58:15,746 --> 00:58:17,581
you're a really great guy,
you know that?

749
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,756
can i ask you something?

750
00:58:25,756 --> 00:58:26,924
sure.

751
00:58:28,634 --> 00:58:30,052
would you ever...

752
00:58:38,018 --> 00:58:40,020
go out with a guy like me?

753
00:58:41,438 --> 00:58:42,898
i don't think so.

754
00:58:58,455 --> 00:58:59,665
uh-oh.

755
00:58:59,665 --> 00:59:01,124
what? what is it?

756
00:59:05,128 --> 00:59:07,923
oh! fuck, dude!

757
00:59:07,923 --> 00:59:11,510
oh, god, ash.

758
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:13,136

759
00:59:13,136 --> 00:59:14,805
why?

760
00:59:16,098 --> 00:59:18,141
that's just the way it is.

761
00:59:18,141 --> 00:59:19,184
that's the way it is?

762
00:59:19,184 --> 00:59:21,478
you're a geek, right?

763
00:59:21,478 --> 00:59:24,022
um, yeah. i guess.

764
00:59:24,022 --> 00:59:26,233
well, i'm a hot cheerleader,
right?

765
00:59:26,233 --> 00:59:27,651
yeah.

766
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:30,237
geeks and cheerleaders
don't date.

767
00:59:30,237 --> 00:59:32,573
we're just different.

768
00:59:32,573 --> 00:59:36,827
well, why?
you just said i was a good guy.

769
00:59:36,827 --> 00:59:39,121
it's just not that simple.

770
00:59:39,121 --> 00:59:40,664
am i not goodlooking enough?

771
00:59:40,664 --> 00:59:41,832
yeah.

00:59:49,214 --> 00:59:50,632

779
01:00:30,214 --> 01:00:31,590

780
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:32,758
uh-oh.

781
01:00:33,884 --> 01:00:35,886
mother puss bucket.

782
01:00:40,974 --> 01:00:43,852
do you like being made fun of?

783
01:00:43,852 --> 01:00:44,937
or beat up?

784
01:00:44,937 --> 01:00:46,146
of course not.

785
01:00:46,146 --> 01:00:47,773
neither do i.

786
01:00:49,066 --> 01:00:52,110
that's exactly what would
happen if we dated.

787
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:54,655
my friends would
eat me alive.

788
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:59,868
did you ever think that maybe
they're not your friends?

789
01:01:13,924 --> 01:01:16,301
ash...ash...

790
01:01:16,301 --> 01:01:17,594

809
01:02:43,722 --> 01:02:48,352

810
01:02:48,352 --> 01:02:51,355
my mom.

811
01:02:51,355 --> 01:02:53,065

878
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:46,502
what?

879
01:08:46,543 --> 01:08:47,711
yeah. he's been telling
the whole school

880
01:08:47,711 --> 01:08:49,129
that he's been screwing you
for months.

881
01:08:49,129 --> 01:08:50,839
no, we were waiting for prom.

882
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:52,257
that's not what he told me.

883
01:08:52,257 --> 01:08:55,177
yeah, i don't even think
you'd make it to prom.

884
01:08:55,177 --> 01:08:57,095
because he's got like 6 girls
on the side.

885
01:08:57,095 --> 01:08:58,180
what?

886
01:08:58,222 --> 01:09:01,350

and sarah.

887
01:09:01,391 --> 01:09:02,726
whores!

888
01:09:02,726 --> 01:09:04,603
and you know what else,

889
01:09:04,603 --> 01:09:06,730
he told me you're not
a  natural blonde.

890
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:07,731
what?

891
01:09:07,731 --> 01:09:08,857

892
01:09:11,568 --> 01:09:13,195

893
01:09:14,404 --> 01:09:15,572
yeah! fuck him up!

894
01:09:17,366 --> 01:09:19,535
you fucking fucker!

895
01:09:19,535 --> 01:09:22,204
maybe if you reciprocated
once in awhile

896
01:09:22,204 --> 01:09:23,330
you'd know,

897
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:26,375
the carpet
does match the blinds!

898
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:27,376

899
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:29,253

902
01:09:43,725 --> 01:09:44,768
yeah!

903
01:10:00,576 --> 01:10:01,618
it's not gonna hold.

904
01:10:01,618 --> 01:10:02,786
we need to get out of here.

905
01:10:02,786 --> 01:10:04,246
well, maybe we should
spend more time

906
01:10:04,288 --> 01:10:05,455
building up the barricade
and less time

907
01:10:05,455 --> 01:10:06,748
making out in the back.

908
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:08,750
well, maybe if people knocked
instead of just barging in.

909
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:10,169
what does that have to do
with anything, janet?

910
01:10:10,169 --> 01:10:12,129
oh, my god!
stop it both of you!

911
01:10:12,129 --> 01:10:14,673
now we're getting out of here
alive,

912
01:10:14,673 --> 01:10:16,508
and to do that we need
to work together.

913
01:10:16,508 --> 01:10:17,634
how?

914
01:10:27,769 --> 01:10:29,271
i have a plan.

915
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,418
we reached the stairs.

916
01:11:33,418 --> 01:11:35,504
oh, god, we reached the stairs!

917
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:43,971
eddie! eddie! help! eddie!

918
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:48,225
eddie, help!

919
01:11:48,225 --> 01:11:50,561
jesus christ, we get it already.
you need help!

920
01:11:50,561 --> 01:11:51,812
take a number, get in line.

921
01:11:51,812 --> 01:11:55,524
and shut the fuck up,
would you, please!

922
01:11:55,941 --> 01:11:57,359
eddie!

923
01:11:58,777 --> 01:12:00,779
eddie, help!

924
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:01,864
eddie!

925
01:12:18,046 --> 01:12:20,507
goth chicks kick ass.

926
01:12:20,507 --> 01:12:22,509
eddie, help!

927
01:12:49,786 --> 01:12:51,580
- the gun.
- isn't that...

928
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:53,582
mr. yeardley
the guidance counselor?

929
01:13:04,593 --> 01:13:05,802
it's almost empty.

930
01:13:05,802 --> 01:13:07,304
not good.

931
01:13:07,304 --> 01:13:08,806
definitely not good.

932
01:13:08,806 --> 01:13:10,724
- what now?
- we run!

933
01:13:12,684 --> 01:13:15,312
run away!

934
01:13:28,659 --> 01:13:30,702
which way!

935
01:13:30,702 --> 01:13:32,788
the gym. we can get
to the roof from there.

936
01:13:41,797 --> 01:13:43,966
it's locked!

937
01:13:43,966 --> 01:13:45,175
i got this.

938
01:13:55,144 --> 01:13:56,895
i got it!

939
01:13:57,855 --> 01:13:59,022
eddie, come on!

940
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:06,363
go. go, get to the roof.
i'm gonna hold them.

941
01:14:08,866 --> 01:14:11,368
and willow,
about before with janet...

942
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:14,413
you're right.

943
01:14:15,706 --> 01:14:16,790
i'm an idiot.

944
01:14:21,044 --> 01:14:22,963
i know what i want now.

945
01:14:27,718 --> 01:14:30,012
good. because you still
owe me a date.

946
01:14:37,186 --> 01:14:40,022
it's time for this paladin
to cast a 21st level spell

947
01:14:40,022 --> 01:14:41,440
of zombie whoop-ass.

948
01:15:14,431 --> 01:15:15,599
where's eddie?

949
01:15:17,434 --> 01:15:18,811
holding off the horde.

950
01:15:20,437 --> 01:15:21,730
ok.

951
01:15:24,483 --> 01:15:25,651
but he missed a few.

952
01:17:02,331 --> 01:17:03,624
no.

953
01:17:12,049 --> 01:17:13,759
janet, hold still.

954
01:17:22,226 --> 01:17:23,602
come on!

955
01:17:40,327 --> 01:17:42,079
willow! janet!

956
01:17:53,257 --> 01:17:54,883
suck a duck.

957
01:18:11,275 --> 01:18:12,359
this sucks.

958
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:15,279
yeah.

959
01:18:15,279 --> 01:18:16,780
i'm gonna die.

960
01:18:20,617 --> 01:18:23,745
i don't wanna be a zombie.
this so sucks.

961
01:18:30,252 --> 01:18:31,378
don't leave.

962
01:18:47,311 --> 01:18:48,979
one bullet left.

963
01:18:56,445 --> 01:18:58,655
i don't want to die like this.

964
01:20:00,008 --> 01:20:01,218
eddie!

965
01:20:05,055 --> 01:20:06,849
- ok, we have a problem.
- what?

966
01:20:06,849 --> 01:20:08,851
zombies don't jump.
they climb.

967
01:20:40,757 --> 01:20:42,134
brad!

968
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:47,222
brad!

969
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:16,168
so i guess we'll never
get that date.

970
01:21:19,463 --> 01:21:21,548
no. it sucks.

971
01:21:23,467 --> 01:21:25,177
i was totally gonna take you
to applebees.

972
01:21:49,159 --> 01:21:50,869
attention, attention.

973
01:21:50,869 --> 01:21:52,955
the zombie threat
has been contained.

974
01:21:52,955 --> 01:21:55,874
all survivors make your way
to the front lawn.

975
01:21:58,293 --> 01:22:00,045
go! go! go!
i want to get a perimeter.

976
01:22:00,045 --> 01:22:01,380
set it up. move it, move it,
move it!

977
01:22:03,382 --> 01:22:05,300
the zombie threat
has been contained.

978
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:08,137
the zombie threat
has been eliminated.

979
01:22:08,137 --> 01:22:11,515
all survivors make your way
to the front lawn.

980
01:22:21,191 --> 01:22:23,527
so applebees, huh?

981
01:22:23,527 --> 01:22:26,196
bet your ass. i got a gift card.

982
01:22:26,196 --> 01:22:28,240
wow, you really know how
to spoil a girl.

983
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:31,285
yeah. but only the right girl.

984
01:23:33,931 --> 01:23:38,060
<i>attention, all shoppers.
attention, all shoppers.</i>

985
01:26:37,489 --> 01:26:38,699
you know what i'm thinking?

986
01:26:38,699 --> 01:26:40,701
maybe we got a good thing
going here.

987
01:26:40,701 --> 01:26:43,412
maybe we shouldn't be
in such a hurry to leave.
