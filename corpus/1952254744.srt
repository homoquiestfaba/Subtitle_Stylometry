1
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,561
Man #2:
Alpha team, Qual é a vossa situaçao?

2
00:01:03,632 --> 00:01:06,862
Man #1:
Regulator nominal. Stand by.

3
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:14,471
We're looking at another
30 to 45 minutes.

4
00:01:23,218 --> 00:01:27,441
Pressure levels holding steady
at seven-niner-zero, p.s.i.

5
00:01:27,506 --> 00:01:29,262
That's what I wanted to hear.

6
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,240
Okay, guys.
Conditions are green.

7
00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:33,835
We're go on regulator assembly.

8
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:38,162
Roger that, Topside. We'll snap her
together nice and quick.

9
00:01:38,227 --> 00:01:41,294
Commence additional stage hookup.

10
00:01:41,364 --> 00:01:43,186
Retention 20%.

11
00:01:43,251 --> 00:01:45,106
Ease her up gently, fellas.

12
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:47,081
Make sure the manifold seal
is nice and tight.

13
00:01:47,156 --> 00:01:49,709
Integrity looks solid.
Checking for stress points.

14
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,690
Increasing tension by 3.5.

15
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:02,732
- We're four hours behind!
- Don't worry.

16
00:02:02,805 --> 00:02:04,561
We'll make up
the lost time.

17
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:06,637
Isn't Boarder done
with that cable patch yet?

18
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,597
He's still
working on it.

19
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:10,637
Keep in mind,
it took six hours

20
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,947
just to compress him
for that depth.

21
00:02:13,014 --> 00:02:15,916
And another two
to get him on site.

22
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:18,380
See if we can't get him
to pick up the pace.

23
00:02:18,455 --> 00:02:20,430
What's his current
position?

24
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:22,958
1,540 feet down,

25
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:25,617
and 100 yards from the edge
of the trench.

26
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:27,598
That's a five-mile
drop-off.

27
00:02:27,672 --> 00:02:29,581
So remind him
not to do any sightseeing.

28
00:02:32,313 --> 00:02:34,735
Deep Calm,
this is Bountress, over.

29
00:02:36,312 --> 00:02:38,647
Deep Calm?

30
00:02:38,713 --> 00:02:40,371
Dave Porter,
are you down there?

31
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:42,035
Copy, Bountress.

32
00:02:42,106 --> 00:02:43,796
How's it going?

33
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:46,102
How do you think?
I'm freezing my nuts off.

34
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:48,112
The super wants me
to remind you

35
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:50,357
that you're not getting
paid by the hour.

36
00:02:50,426 --> 00:02:52,881
Tell him he's welcome to come
down and give me a hand.

37
00:02:52,954 --> 00:02:54,515
I'll let him know.

38
00:02:54,587 --> 00:02:57,075
Slap on that Band-Aid
as quick as you can.

39
00:02:57,147 --> 00:02:59,002
Bountress, over.

40
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,993
What the--?
I've got a contact.

41
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,777
Down that deep?

42
00:03:06,843 --> 00:03:08,567
Impossible.

43
00:03:09,596 --> 00:03:11,701
Shouldn't be anything
big enough to register.

44
00:03:11,772 --> 00:03:13,299
Something is there,

45
00:03:13,372 --> 00:03:17,235
200 yards southeast of Porter's
position and closing.

46
00:03:17,309 --> 00:03:19,283
- Get him back on the horn.
- Porter, this is Bountress.

47
00:03:19,357 --> 00:03:20,405
Come in.

48
00:03:21,565 --> 00:03:24,021
- Repeat, this is Bountress.
- 100 yards.

49
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,604
- 75!
- Porter, come in!

50
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:31,637
Porter,
where the hell are you?

51
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,881
- Go ahead, Bountress.
- You've got an unknown

52
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,246
- approaching from southeast.
- Bountress, you're breaking up.

53
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,198
Something's coming
right at you!

54
00:03:39,263 --> 00:03:41,402
- Say again.
- 30 yards!

55
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,326
- 20.
- Get him out of there!

56
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:45,780
Look, damn it!
He's right beside you!

57
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:49,686
( screaming )

58
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:57,085
Porter.

59
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,462
Porter.

60
00:03:58,528 --> 00:03:59,870
Porter!

61
00:03:59,936 --> 00:04:02,653
Porter.
Come in, Porter.

62
00:04:02,721 --> 00:04:05,372
This is Bountress.
Can you read us?

63
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,912
( grunting )

64
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:02,532
Woman:
Here, Ben Baby.

65
00:05:02,598 --> 00:05:05,828
- Your usual.
- Hasta mañana.

66
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:16,513
- Hey, qué pasa?
- Qué pasa, man?

67
00:05:18,504 --> 00:05:22,727
- Who's your latest victim?
- This one's from Frisco.

68
00:05:22,793 --> 00:05:24,735
- I want to treat her extra special.
- Hey.

69
00:05:24,809 --> 00:05:25,703
Here he goes!

70
00:05:28,073 --> 00:05:30,375
- Here comes El Guapo!
- Whew!

71
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,817
- Good morning, Hector.
- Buenos días, Ben.

72
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:43,396
- Brought me coffee?
- Café solo.

73
00:05:44,842 --> 00:05:47,941
Will you get that death-trap
flying anytime soon?

74
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:49,702
Ben: I'll leave you
guys alone.

75
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:52,488
- Try not to kill each other.
- El pendejo?

76
00:05:52,555 --> 00:05:53,603
Yeah.

77
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,526
Rise and shine!

78
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,079
Hey, you're the one
who's late.

79
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:10,215
If you didn't stop for every
chica, you'd be on time.

80
00:06:10,285 --> 00:06:11,878
Yeah.

81
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:14,022
- Your usual.
- And here's yours.

82
00:06:21,742 --> 00:06:23,847
Ben: Sy, is this
a great life or what?

83
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,879
- Sy: Mi vida loca, amigo.
- Luis pays us to patrol the beach.

84
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,406
Some guy at the harbor
told me about this dive spot

85
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,196
- that's crawling with lobsters.
- Sounds good.

86
00:06:33,263 --> 00:06:35,238
It's south of Banderas Point.

87
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,800
Oh no. That's way out
of our patrol zone.

88
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:39,595
You'll get us
in trouble, again.

89
00:06:39,664 --> 00:06:41,672
- Don't worry about it.
- Again.

90
00:06:41,744 --> 00:06:45,093
I said, don't worry about it.
We'll do it after our shift.

91
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:47,111
No one's going to find out.

92
00:06:47,185 --> 00:06:49,902
- Trust me.
- Trust you?

93
00:06:52,273 --> 00:06:55,121
Why do I let you talk me
into things like this?

94
00:06:55,185 --> 00:06:57,574
'Cause you're
my bitch.

95
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,406
- You wish.
- ( Ben laughs )

96
00:07:14,515 --> 00:07:17,330
Man: I got you!
Oh, I got you!

97
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,981
Man #2: Don't try to reel
him in all at once.

98
00:07:20,051 --> 00:07:22,539
Let him tire
himself out.

99
00:07:22,612 --> 00:07:24,401
( Man #1 straining )

100
00:07:24,468 --> 00:07:27,436
I got him!
I got him!

101
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:29,102
What's it
gonna take?

102
00:07:29,173 --> 00:07:31,726
Man #2: Depends.
Once I saw--

103
00:07:31,797 --> 00:07:33,739
a marlin fight--

104
00:07:33,813 --> 00:07:35,723
for five hours!

105
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:38,001
Five hours?
Oh!

106
00:07:40,534 --> 00:07:42,639
Come on,
you sucker!

107
00:08:02,872 --> 00:08:04,214
Oh, what happened?

108
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,549
The line must
have broken.

109
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:09,072
- Reel it in!
- Man #1: I got something.

110
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:11,794
Here it is, señor.

111
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:21,682
Man #1: 30 years!

112
00:08:25,177 --> 00:08:26,933
- Sy: Man--
- No one will know.

113
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:29,522
You just gotta learn
to trust me.

114
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:32,628
I know where the best
lobsters are.

115
00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:34,771
- Sy: What if--
- Stop nagging.

116
00:08:34,842 --> 00:08:37,876
- You're like an old woman.
- I have to stay here and work.

117
00:08:37,947 --> 00:08:39,354
I don't want
to get fired.

118
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,492
I don't think
it's a good idea.

119
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:44,182
- Just relax. I'll be back.
- Oh, man!

120
00:08:44,252 --> 00:08:47,994
10 minutes. And I'll bring
you up a five pounder.

121
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,948
Okay, you better.
You better.

122
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:52,565
- I will.
- C'mon, dive. Vámonos!

123
00:08:52,636 --> 00:08:54,327
Vámonos, amigo!

124
00:08:55,804 --> 00:08:57,714
Hasta luego!

125
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,238
Man: What were you
doing down there?

126
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:51,805
Getting some dinner.

127
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:54,335
That's a high-powered
communications cable!

128
00:10:54,408 --> 00:10:56,546
It's not something
to screw around with!

129
00:10:56,616 --> 00:10:59,103
I don't think it's me
you've got to worry about.

130
00:10:59,176 --> 00:11:01,064
Man:
What's that?

131
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:03,779
A shark's tooth. I pried it
from the underwater cable.

132
00:11:03,848 --> 00:11:05,409
We'll take it from here.

133
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:07,685
Just be more careful
in the future, okay?

134
00:11:07,753 --> 00:11:08,866
Okay.

135
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,082
No one's gonna know, huh?

136
00:11:14,153 --> 00:11:17,252
- We're gonna hear about this.
- Ruiz is not going to know.

137
00:11:17,322 --> 00:11:18,849
He won't find out.

138
00:11:19,882 --> 00:11:21,191
Cuñado.

139
00:11:21,258 --> 00:11:22,600
Oh, jeez.

140
00:12:51,923 --> 00:12:53,134
( screams )

141
00:12:53,203 --> 00:12:56,334
- Sorry, Ms. Stone.
- Good evening, Todd.

142
00:12:56,403 --> 00:12:59,884
- Working late again?
- As usual.

143
00:13:01,492 --> 00:13:04,907
You've been running around
non-stop, all day.

144
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,842
- Why don't you take a break?
- I have so much to do.

145
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,666
I got to catalog all this stuff
and get it down to the prep area.

146
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:15,476
Bonn has been waiting
65 million years.

147
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,672
I think she can wait
a half-hour

148
00:13:18,742 --> 00:13:21,611
while you grab a sandwich.

149
00:13:21,686 --> 00:13:24,686
No thanks.
You're always too kind.

150
00:13:24,758 --> 00:13:26,962
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Bye.

151
00:13:58,265 --> 00:13:59,859
Mystery shark?

152
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,559
Oh my God!

153
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:20,248
Man: Right, Mr. Ruiz.
Yes, make it happen.

154
00:14:20,315 --> 00:14:21,657
Morning, Mr. Ruiz.

155
00:14:21,723 --> 00:14:23,796
- You wanted to see me?
- Thanks for coming.

156
00:14:23,868 --> 00:14:27,894
This is Jeff Tolley,
CEO at Apex Communications.

157
00:14:27,964 --> 00:14:30,746
Ben here is one
of the resort's patrol guys.

158
00:14:30,813 --> 00:14:33,234
- Why don't you sit down?
- Sure. Thank you.

159
00:14:33,308 --> 00:14:35,959
Mr. Tolley has a lot
of guests staying here.

160
00:14:36,028 --> 00:14:36,922
Really?

161
00:14:36,988 --> 00:14:39,193
We're having a celebration
on the launch

162
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:42,457
- of our new trans-Pacific cable.
- I heard about that.

163
00:14:42,526 --> 00:14:44,947
The harbor-master says
you're bringing in a cruise liner.

164
00:14:45,021 --> 00:14:48,338
Tolley: Well, it's
not quite that big.

165
00:14:48,414 --> 00:14:51,545
Some of Señor Tolley's
people say

166
00:14:51,614 --> 00:14:54,200
that you were diving
near that cable yesterday?

167
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,764
Yeah, I was.

168
00:14:55,838 --> 00:14:58,294
But I wasn't messing with it,
if that's what you mean.

169
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,254
They said that...

170
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:03,287
it seems something bit
through the protective covering

171
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:05,050
and damaged some
of the fiber optics.

172
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,153
That's right. I found
a shark tooth in the cable.

173
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:10,558
I'm hoping this is
a random incident.

174
00:15:10,624 --> 00:15:14,236
Last month, we had to bury
50 miles of cable near Japan

175
00:15:14,304 --> 00:15:17,403
just because a cargo ship
snagged it with its anchor.

176
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:19,360
I'd hate to do that
again here.

177
00:15:19,425 --> 00:15:21,280
No, the shark was probably
just curious

178
00:15:21,345 --> 00:15:24,248
and bit the cable
just to see what it was.

179
00:15:24,322 --> 00:15:26,973
Sharks are always
biting things.

180
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:28,798
Ben: I wouldn't
worry about it.

181
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:31,484
- Thanks for the reassurance.
- No problem.

182
00:15:31,554 --> 00:15:33,278
- Ben, let me walk you out.
- Sure.

183
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:35,485
Nice to meet you.
Pleasure.

184
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,553
I hired you to keep the beaches
safe and protect the guests.

185
00:15:42,627 --> 00:15:46,718
So from now on you will keep
to your assigned patrol area.

186
00:15:46,787 --> 00:15:48,446
Am I clear?

187
00:15:50,372 --> 00:15:51,997
Yes, sir.

188
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:28,385
Woman: Uh-huh.

189
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:31,846
Come on.

190
00:16:38,216 --> 00:16:40,126
Man:
Andale, come on!

191
00:16:44,424 --> 00:16:46,628
Come on, mi amor.

192
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:52,864
Baby, don't go
so far out.

193
00:16:52,938 --> 00:16:56,615
- Por qué?
- You don't know what's out there.

194
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,432
Are you afraid that something
is going to swim up

195
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:01,025
and bite your culo?

196
00:17:32,397 --> 00:17:34,340
( woman screams )

197
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:52,782
It's just
a sand tiger shark.

198
00:17:52,847 --> 00:17:54,603
Pretty ugly,

199
00:17:54,671 --> 00:17:56,646
but harmless unless
you're a fish about that big.

200
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,443
I heard it scared
that girl so bad,

201
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:01,065
she ran all the way up
the street buck naked.

202
00:18:01,136 --> 00:18:02,892
Almost caused
an accident.

203
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,506
Ramirez will think twice
about bringing a girl to this spot.

204
00:18:06,577 --> 00:18:08,911
So, what do we do
with the shark?

205
00:18:08,977 --> 00:18:11,213
Get someone with a truck
to cart it back to the dock.

206
00:18:11,281 --> 00:18:13,769
I'm sure some of the fishermen
will chop it up and use it for bait.

207
00:18:13,841 --> 00:18:16,013
- You got it.
- Cool.

208
00:18:27,699 --> 00:18:30,088
Do you know where
I can find Ben Carpenter?

209
00:18:30,163 --> 00:18:32,749
- Yes, he's over there.
- Hey, thanks.

210
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:42,346
- I'm looking for Ben Carpenter.
- That would be me.

211
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,591
I stopped by your office
and they said

212
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,548
I might be able
to catch you down here.

213
00:18:46,612 --> 00:18:48,717
Well, you caught me.

214
00:18:48,788 --> 00:18:50,315
Hi, I'm Cat Stone.

215
00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:53,455
I'm a marine biologist
from the Sand Diego Aquarium.

216
00:18:53,525 --> 00:18:56,373
- I saw your message on the
internet. - Well, that was fast.

217
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:59,754
It must be something important
for you to come here for a tooth.

218
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:03,540
Oh, it's a quick flight and
I enjoy the change of scenery.

219
00:19:03,606 --> 00:19:06,290
Besides, if your tooth
is what I think it is,

220
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:09,261
- it'll be worth the trip.
- Then I won't keep you in suspense.

221
00:19:09,335 --> 00:19:11,342
Oh, great!

222
00:19:13,655 --> 00:19:15,510
So what's so special
about it?

223
00:19:15,575 --> 00:19:18,226
I checked online but couldn't find
a shark that'd match it.

224
00:19:18,295 --> 00:19:20,368
We think it's a subspecies
of the mako shark.

225
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,545
Very rare and
extremely nomadic.

226
00:19:22,616 --> 00:19:24,950
Where did you say
you found this?

227
00:19:25,016 --> 00:19:28,332
I pried it from an underwater cable
about five miles offshore.

228
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:31,156
Could I get
the exact location?

229
00:19:31,224 --> 00:19:34,356
- Sure.
- Great.

230
00:19:34,425 --> 00:19:37,011
You know, it's
a pretty big tooth.

231
00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:38,675
How dangerous
is this shark?

232
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:40,655
No more than
the regular mako.

233
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:42,551
I'm just concerned
about our beaches.

234
00:19:42,618 --> 00:19:45,335
If there's a threat,
I'd really like to know.

235
00:19:45,402 --> 00:19:48,566
These sharks always stay out
in the open ocean.

236
00:19:50,554 --> 00:19:54,133
I know our aquarium would love
to buy this tooth from you.

237
00:19:54,203 --> 00:19:55,185
Keep it.

238
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:57,299
Think of it as
my contribution to science.

239
00:19:57,371 --> 00:19:59,226
Thanks.
I appreciate that.

240
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,812
So, now that you have
your tooth,

241
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:03,771
is it right back up
to San Diego?

242
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,810
No, I'll hang out
for a couple of days

243
00:20:05,884 --> 00:20:07,892
and see if it might still
be in the area.

244
00:20:07,964 --> 00:20:11,030
- I'll let you know if I find anything.
- Okay.

245
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,621
No flirting over there.
We have work to do.

246
00:20:16,604 --> 00:20:18,361
Looks like you gotta go.

247
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:19,411
Yeah...

248
00:20:20,957 --> 00:20:22,812
I'll see you around.

249
00:20:22,877 --> 00:20:25,528
- It was nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

250
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,361
You know,
you're dead meat.

251
00:20:36,095 --> 00:20:38,517
- Anything else?
- No, thank you.

252
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:40,860
- Man on phone: Hello?
- Hey. It's Cat.

253
00:20:40,927 --> 00:20:43,448
- What's going on?
- I just saw this tooth. It's genuine.

254
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,822
- As in the real McCoy.
- No.

255
00:20:45,888 --> 00:20:48,571
Get those video guys
down here as fast as you can.

256
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:51,061
I want to document all of this
before I take it public.

257
00:20:51,136 --> 00:20:52,991
- Right.
- And keep it quiet.

258
00:20:53,056 --> 00:20:55,391
- I'll send somebody down.
- I owe you one.

259
00:20:55,457 --> 00:20:57,083
Okay. See ya.

260
00:21:03,777 --> 00:21:05,785
( Spanish rock music plays )

261
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,146
¿Adónde vas?

262
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,904
( speaking Spanish )

263
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:55,778
( speaking Spanish )

264
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,822
( man and woman scream )

265
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,765
Oh shit!

266
00:23:21,454 --> 00:23:23,756
( phone rings )

267
00:23:30,831 --> 00:23:33,679
- Do you want to answer it?
- Not really.

268
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,513
- What the hell's going on?
- It's the first power grid.

269
00:23:41,584 --> 00:23:43,821
I was running a tracer,

270
00:23:43,888 --> 00:23:45,863
checking
the line resistance

271
00:23:45,937 --> 00:23:47,693
- and we lost it.
- You overloaded the line?

272
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:50,412
No, sir. It was
well below capacity.

273
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:53,002
One minute it was fine,
and the next, we shorted out.

274
00:23:53,074 --> 00:23:55,889
Fuck! That's all I need.
Call Chuck Rampart.

275
00:23:55,954 --> 00:23:58,704
Tell him to go out
and check the cable.

276
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,712
In the meantime,
I want you code monkeys

277
00:24:00,786 --> 00:24:04,169
to figure out a way to make
the backup system work properly.

278
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,966
That's what
I pay you for.

279
00:24:07,378 --> 00:24:08,753
Fuck!

280
00:24:10,547 --> 00:24:12,402
Tolley isn't happy?

281
00:24:12,467 --> 00:24:14,955
Assholes are
never happy.

282
00:24:24,692 --> 00:24:26,547
Hey.

283
00:24:26,613 --> 00:24:28,751
Here there, amigo.

284
00:24:28,821 --> 00:24:30,959
You guys off
in search of Atlantis?

285
00:24:31,028 --> 00:24:32,654
I wish.

286
00:24:32,725 --> 00:24:35,092
I got another problem
with the fiber line.

287
00:24:35,158 --> 00:24:38,092
Trouble in a junction box
10 miles out, so...

288
00:24:38,165 --> 00:24:40,784
we'll take her out for a look,
report back what we find.

289
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,636
I saw a break in the cable
off the coast, two days ago.

290
00:24:43,702 --> 00:24:45,229
A shark bit through
the casing.

291
00:24:47,031 --> 00:24:48,624
Really?

292
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,451
Man, they never
tell me anything.

293
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:52,112
So, Chuck,

294
00:24:52,183 --> 00:24:54,420
when will you let
me pilot her?

295
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:56,658
You got to pass my test
on submersibles first.

296
00:24:56,727 --> 00:24:59,859
Don't you think I'm too old
for a driver's test?

297
00:24:59,928 --> 00:25:03,671
Maybe. But a Jeep doesn't
implode when you drive it wrong.

298
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:04,914
Right.

299
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,862
Take it easy,
guys. Okay?

300
00:25:07,928 --> 00:25:10,132
- Adiós.
- Adiós, amigos.

301
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,884
You'll actually let him
drive the sub?

302
00:25:12,953 --> 00:25:14,895
Kid's got
damn good instincts.

303
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:18,002
Make a hell of
a submariner someday.

304
00:25:18,073 --> 00:25:19,983
Only if he listens
to you, right?

305
00:25:20,057 --> 00:25:22,000
Of course.

306
00:25:26,203 --> 00:25:28,504
Man:
I love Mexico.

307
00:25:28,571 --> 00:25:30,327
Man #2: Great place
to be shooting.

308
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:32,468
Man #1: Not a bad way
to make a living.

309
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:34,611
Man #2:
I'm all for it.

310
00:25:34,683 --> 00:25:37,302
Look over there,
huh?

311
00:25:37,372 --> 00:25:40,274
- Man #1: Let's get shooting.
- All right. Let's do it.

312
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,641
Whoa!

313
00:25:45,596 --> 00:25:47,701
Get the cameras.
I'll check out the boat.

314
00:25:47,772 --> 00:25:49,431
Man #1:
Yes, ma'am.

315
00:25:53,373 --> 00:25:56,668
Don't think I don't know you're
checking out my ass, Friedman.

316
00:25:56,733 --> 00:26:01,010
- Who, me? Aw, come on.
- Ohh, I like her.

317
00:26:01,085 --> 00:26:04,184
Davis, you like anything
with a pair of tits.

318
00:26:04,254 --> 00:26:05,978
- That's true.
- It is.

319
00:26:06,046 --> 00:26:08,315
But you're the ass man.
Remember?

320
00:26:08,382 --> 00:26:10,422
And you'd do anything
for that ass.

321
00:26:10,494 --> 00:26:12,829
- Fuckin' A-right, man.
- Come on!

322
00:26:33,249 --> 00:26:36,184
- Nice.
- Cat: Playing with your toys?

323
00:26:36,257 --> 00:26:39,039
Toys are actually
what it's all about.

324
00:26:39,105 --> 00:26:41,691
You see, this here
happens to be

325
00:26:41,761 --> 00:26:44,827
an underwater
lipstick camera.

326
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:47,353
Looks pretty small
to me.

327
00:26:49,698 --> 00:26:52,698
Well, it's really
not the size that matters.

328
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,625
Right, buddy?

329
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,414
Should be one hell
of a POV shot

330
00:26:56,483 --> 00:26:58,785
if we get in close enough
and stick a shark.

331
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:00,640
You're going to get
close all right.

332
00:27:00,707 --> 00:27:02,878
Get as much footage
as you can get.

333
00:27:02,947 --> 00:27:05,282
We're pulling up
to the location

334
00:27:05,347 --> 00:27:07,616
where they found
that tooth.

335
00:27:07,683 --> 00:27:10,302
Guess what, boys?
You start chumming.

336
00:27:11,428 --> 00:27:15,073
Oh, man!
This really stinks.

337
00:27:17,413 --> 00:27:19,518
All right, sharky.
Come and get it.

338
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,103
What the hell?

339
00:28:32,171 --> 00:28:34,921
- Cat: Holy cow!
- Is that it?

340
00:28:34,988 --> 00:28:37,607
Looks about the right size.
Get the cameras!

341
00:28:43,149 --> 00:28:45,538
Freidman: All right, baby.
Come and get it!

342
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:01,099
Cat:
You getting it?

343
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:03,687
- I need to get lower.
- I'll get you there, man.

344
00:29:08,431 --> 00:29:09,708
All right, bro'.

345
00:29:09,775 --> 00:29:12,164
Come on. Here we go.
You're hooked, man.

346
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:13,614
Davis:
Yeah, all right.

347
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,429
Cat:
Watch out.

348
00:29:17,487 --> 00:29:19,310
Coming through.

349
00:29:30,225 --> 00:29:31,119
Here it comes!

350
00:29:42,674 --> 00:29:45,260
- Un-fucking-believable!
- Did you get it?

351
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,665
Yeah. Animal Planet,
eat your heart out.

352
00:29:47,731 --> 00:29:49,357
- Yes!
- Yes!

353
00:29:49,427 --> 00:29:50,953
Look out!

354
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:02,547
- Shit!
- What are you doing?

355
00:30:02,612 --> 00:30:03,856
Making sure.

356
00:30:10,261 --> 00:30:12,017
Yeah!

357
00:30:12,085 --> 00:30:15,282
That's our baby.
We gotta tag it.

358
00:31:01,946 --> 00:31:04,979
- You got it, Cat!
- You bet your balls.

359
00:31:07,162 --> 00:31:09,170
- Freidman: Come on, baby!
- The tag's working.

360
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:12,090
You guys,
take a look at this.

361
00:31:12,155 --> 00:31:14,260
Whew!
Man, she's going deep.

362
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,640
Cat: Just keep
it rolling.

363
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,490
Holy fucking shit.

364
00:31:18,556 --> 00:31:20,149
We got this baby.

365
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,995
- Yeah! We got it!
- She's happy!

366
00:31:30,365 --> 00:31:33,365
Good boy! Come on.

367
00:31:33,437 --> 00:31:36,088
Thattaboy.
Come on over here.

368
00:31:36,157 --> 00:31:37,466
Here we go!

369
00:31:40,413 --> 00:31:42,901
Thattaboy! Good catch!

370
00:31:42,973 --> 00:31:44,632
Come on,
bring it here.

371
00:31:45,662 --> 00:31:46,938
Good boy!

372
00:31:51,903 --> 00:31:53,212
Come on.

373
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,274
Oh, go get it,
Dirty!

374
00:31:58,719 --> 00:32:00,694
Come on! Go!

375
00:32:00,767 --> 00:32:02,109
Go!

376
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:07,260
Jeez! Stupid dog!

377
00:32:07,328 --> 00:32:09,051
I don't know
why I bring you.

378
00:32:20,129 --> 00:32:21,853
Well, here!
Catch it!

379
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,719
Get it, boy!
Get it!

380
00:32:59,973 --> 00:33:03,651
Wow, this is as surprise.

381
00:33:03,717 --> 00:33:06,848
- Late night social call?
- Resort security matter.

382
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:09,219
Sounds official.

383
00:33:09,286 --> 00:33:10,879
There's been
a shark attack.

384
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:13,508
Come in.

385
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,292
Excuse the mess.
I've been working.

386
00:33:19,367 --> 00:33:22,182
- I can see that.
- And...

387
00:33:22,247 --> 00:33:24,255
trying to quit smoking.

388
00:33:24,328 --> 00:33:26,717
- How's it going?
- Terrible.

389
00:33:27,816 --> 00:33:30,566
- So tell me what happened.
- It's serious.

390
00:33:30,632 --> 00:33:32,574
We found a guy's leg
near a beach

391
00:33:32,648 --> 00:33:34,142
where he was playing
Frisbee with his dog.

392
00:33:34,216 --> 00:33:35,777
Oh my God.

393
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,434
Cataline Stone.
Paleontologist?

394
00:33:42,505 --> 00:33:45,255
San Diego
Natural History Museum.

395
00:33:46,665 --> 00:33:49,982
So I guess this means
you're not a marine biologist.

396
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,898
- You lied to me?
- I had to.

397
00:33:53,962 --> 00:33:57,540
- Why?
- This shark isn't a rare species.

398
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,301
It's supposed
to be extinct.

399
00:34:00,459 --> 00:34:02,183
Megalodon--

400
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:04,673
ancestor to the great
white shark.

401
00:34:05,707 --> 00:34:07,977
It can grow in excess
of 75 feet long...

402
00:34:08,043 --> 00:34:09,734
Ben: Jesus!

403
00:34:09,804 --> 00:34:11,975
with a 10 foot
wide bite.

404
00:34:12,043 --> 00:34:14,826
One of these things
is swimming off my coast?

405
00:34:14,892 --> 00:34:18,984
No. You have a 15 feet long baby
swimming off your coast.

406
00:34:20,236 --> 00:34:22,757
But it's a damn dinosaur.
How did it get here?

407
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:24,771
That's what I'm trying
to find out.

408
00:34:24,845 --> 00:34:26,372
You should have
told me the truth.

409
00:34:26,445 --> 00:34:29,511
- Like you would have believed me.
- That's not the point!

410
00:34:29,581 --> 00:34:32,134
You knew what it was.
You had a responsibility.

411
00:34:32,205 --> 00:34:34,060
I didn't know the shark
would be a danger.

412
00:34:34,126 --> 00:34:36,493
Tell that to the family
of the man who's dead.

413
00:34:37,903 --> 00:34:40,391
This thing is obviously dangerous.
We've got to get rid of it.

414
00:34:40,463 --> 00:34:42,951
- You can't just kill it.
- Watch me.

415
00:34:43,022 --> 00:34:45,030
Do you know what
we can learn from this?

416
00:34:45,103 --> 00:34:48,365
It's like finding a Tyrannosaurus
rex in your backyard.

417
00:34:49,391 --> 00:34:52,653
Cat, I don't see that
as being a good thing.

418
00:34:55,087 --> 00:34:56,265
Ben, wait!

419
00:35:17,042 --> 00:35:21,003
I know what you're going to ask,
so don't even say it.

420
00:35:21,074 --> 00:35:23,463
- Fine. How will you find it?
- I'll find it.

421
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,710
You'll have a hard time
without this.

422
00:35:25,779 --> 00:35:27,666
- You tagged it?
- Yes, I did.

423
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,705
I can come within
10 meters of that shark.

424
00:35:29,779 --> 00:35:33,642
- Close enough to bite you.
- I could confiscate that thing.

425
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,057
You could try.

426
00:35:35,123 --> 00:35:37,098
Or you could come
work on my boat.

427
00:35:39,124 --> 00:35:42,158
- I don't like playing games.
- Neither do I.

428
00:35:42,229 --> 00:35:44,684
So what do you say
we both get what we want?

429
00:35:44,756 --> 00:35:47,309
I can study the shark and
you can protect your beaches.

430
00:35:48,949 --> 00:35:51,088
Beats cruising around
in circles all day.

431
00:35:52,182 --> 00:35:54,037
Lo siento.

432
00:35:57,942 --> 00:35:59,404
All right.

433
00:35:59,478 --> 00:36:02,675
But at the first sign of trouble,
I'm taking it out.

434
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,117
Fair enough.

435
00:36:13,847 --> 00:36:15,309
Smart-ass!

436
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:17,587
Sy:
Well, excuse me!

437
00:36:19,223 --> 00:36:21,941
How can this shark still
be alive after all this time?

438
00:36:22,008 --> 00:36:24,179
Some scientists believe
the Megalodon survived

439
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,518
the extinction of the dinosaurs
and the ice age

440
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:28,919
by living in
deep-water trenches.

441
00:36:28,984 --> 00:36:31,635
And no one's seen one
after all this time?

442
00:36:35,353 --> 00:36:38,004
Hey, guys,
check this out.

443
00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:40,245
I was going through
yesterday's footage.

444
00:36:40,314 --> 00:36:42,102
Take a look at this.

445
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,079
Wait, you put
a camera on the shark?

446
00:36:44,154 --> 00:36:46,042
You gotta love
the sharkcam, man.

447
00:36:46,106 --> 00:36:47,829
Is that the cable
where you found the tooth?

448
00:36:47,899 --> 00:36:49,492
Yeah, that's
the Apex cable.

449
00:36:53,595 --> 00:36:55,188
Hey, guys!

450
00:36:55,259 --> 00:36:57,877
We're getting a signal.
West-18.

451
00:36:57,947 --> 00:36:59,955
That's about a half-mile
due northeast.

452
00:37:00,028 --> 00:37:02,875
- Okay.
- Get the cameras ready, boys.

453
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,012
- You got it!
- Let's go.

454
00:37:10,685 --> 00:37:12,310
David: Uh, it's--

455
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,290
it's headed due east.

456
00:37:16,989 --> 00:37:19,193
Ben: East.
Due east.

457
00:37:20,894 --> 00:37:22,934
Jesus, it's headed
for the resort.

458
00:37:23,006 --> 00:37:24,467
Full throttle, now!

459
00:38:04,194 --> 00:38:05,568
There it is!

460
00:38:12,034 --> 00:38:13,889
Jimmy, this is Ben.

461
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,760
- What is it?
- A shark's heading for the shore.

462
00:38:17,827 --> 00:38:20,063
Get everyone
out of the water, now!

463
00:38:23,043 --> 00:38:24,538
Shark! Shark!

464
00:38:24,612 --> 00:38:26,717
Everybody
out of the water!

465
00:38:28,068 --> 00:38:31,614
Shark! Shark!
Everybody out of the water!

466
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:38,875
Out of the water,
everybody!

467
00:38:39,909 --> 00:38:41,567
Shark! Shark!

468
00:38:41,637 --> 00:38:44,125
Everybody
out of the water!

469
00:39:00,807 --> 00:39:02,269
Shark!

470
00:39:02,343 --> 00:39:03,969
Shark!

471
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:07,491
Everybody
out of the water!

472
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,309
Everybody...
out!

473
00:39:19,368 --> 00:39:21,256
Ben:
Faster! Go!

474
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:23,879
Faster!

475
00:39:49,227 --> 00:39:50,634
Put the gun down!

476
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:02,916
( screaming )

477
00:40:15,214 --> 00:40:17,451
What are you doing?
I had it in my sight.

478
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:20,454
You did it!
He's heading back out to sea.

479
00:40:22,927 --> 00:40:25,927
- Problem solved. No one got hurt.
- We were lucky!

480
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,876
We were very lucky.

481
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,573
It's fast.

482
00:40:36,336 --> 00:40:38,027
What's our speed?

483
00:40:39,056 --> 00:40:41,642
We're barely keeping pace
at 20 knots.

484
00:40:46,001 --> 00:40:47,495
Ben: Oh no!

485
00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:49,838
Faster. It's headed
for that boat.

486
00:40:59,474 --> 00:41:02,027
All right, bro'!
Muy bien!

487
00:41:04,978 --> 00:41:06,505
Yes, sir!

488
00:41:23,701 --> 00:41:25,010
Guys!

489
00:41:32,054 --> 00:41:33,909
Oh shit,
it's gonna ram them!

490
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,127
Shark!

491
00:41:43,511 --> 00:41:45,616
Pull in! Shark!

492
00:41:45,687 --> 00:41:48,021
Shark! Guys!

493
00:41:56,344 --> 00:41:57,904
Hey!

494
00:41:57,976 --> 00:42:01,042
Move! Move!

495
00:42:01,112 --> 00:42:04,407
Hola! Como estás?

496
00:42:05,976 --> 00:42:09,075
Hey! Move the boat!
Move!

497
00:42:09,145 --> 00:42:10,934
( speaking Spanish )

498
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:15,605
Oh, shit!

499
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:25,589
Go!

500
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,290
- We're not going to make it!
- Shit!

501
00:42:38,396 --> 00:42:39,738
Ayúdame!

502
00:42:58,429 --> 00:43:00,088
Pedro!

503
00:43:20,607 --> 00:43:23,924
No! The shark's dragging her
out to sea!

504
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,117
Ben: Pull over! This guy
needs medical attention!

505
00:43:31,713 --> 00:43:33,568
Gimme a hand here.
Wait!

506
00:43:33,633 --> 00:43:35,292
Help me get him in the boat.

507
00:43:35,361 --> 00:43:37,019
Man: Help me,
please!

508
00:43:38,305 --> 00:43:40,313
Cat: Hurry!
Come on, Ben!

509
00:43:41,921 --> 00:43:43,863
Hurry, Ben!
Hurry!

510
00:43:43,938 --> 00:43:45,694
Give me the wheel.
We have to save her.

511
00:43:46,754 --> 00:43:47,769
Hang on!

512
00:43:52,067 --> 00:43:54,587
Ben: Easy.
Watch your head.

513
00:43:54,658 --> 00:43:56,481
Woman: Help!

514
00:43:58,563 --> 00:44:00,057
Help me!

515
00:44:03,076 --> 00:44:05,312
No, no.
She's going down!

516
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,234
Oh my God!

517
00:44:23,238 --> 00:44:24,547
Oh my God!

518
00:44:35,271 --> 00:44:36,678
Hang on!

519
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:41,606
- Go down and help her!
- Help me!

520
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,574
Help me!

521
00:44:44,647 --> 00:44:47,331
Come here!
Hold on to my hand!

522
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,163
Hold on. Hold on.

523
00:44:48,232 --> 00:44:50,621
Hold on.

524
00:44:55,241 --> 00:44:57,762
- Hold on to me!
- Get her in!

525
00:45:31,244 --> 00:45:34,725
We're damn lucky. We're indemnified
against legal action.

526
00:45:34,796 --> 00:45:37,699
You're talking about legal action
when two people have been killed.

527
00:45:37,773 --> 00:45:40,522
You knew about this Jurassic
shark and didn't tell me.

528
00:45:40,589 --> 00:45:43,655
- I thought I could handle it!
- You thought wrong!

529
00:45:43,725 --> 00:45:46,442
I can kill the shark. But
we need to close the beaches.

530
00:45:46,509 --> 00:45:47,971
People pay a lot of money
to come down here

531
00:45:48,046 --> 00:45:50,250
and they expect to use everything
including the beaches!

532
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:52,074
You can not let people
swim in the water

533
00:45:52,141 --> 00:45:54,280
when there's a shark
out there!

534
00:45:58,447 --> 00:46:00,683
Okay, let me handle
the beaches.

535
00:46:00,751 --> 00:46:04,744
I'll come up with something. But
kill this thing quickly and quietly.

536
00:46:04,815 --> 00:46:06,539
Understood.

537
00:46:11,984 --> 00:46:13,413
Ben: Hey...

538
00:46:13,488 --> 00:46:15,310
it's okay.

539
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,545
No, it's not okay.

540
00:46:21,616 --> 00:46:24,650
I've studied fossils
my whole life.

541
00:46:24,721 --> 00:46:27,242
Nothing but theories
and guesses...

542
00:46:27,313 --> 00:46:30,444
This was my one chance
to prove that I was right.

543
00:46:31,665 --> 00:46:35,310
Look what happened.
All those people are dead.

544
00:46:35,378 --> 00:46:37,353
And it's all my fault.

545
00:46:37,426 --> 00:46:40,972
- Don't blame yourself.
- How could I be so blind?

546
00:46:41,043 --> 00:46:42,952
Did you see that girl?

547
00:46:43,026 --> 00:46:45,393
She was so scared.

548
00:46:45,459 --> 00:46:49,071
And I had seconds and
I could have saved her life.

549
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:52,434
Cat, what's done is done.
There's nothing we can do.

550
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:56,624
What we have to do now is stop
anyone else from getting hurt.

551
00:46:58,804 --> 00:47:02,099
I was looking at the video
of the shark hugging the cable.

552
00:47:02,165 --> 00:47:05,809
Do you have any idea
why it's attracted to it?

553
00:47:06,837 --> 00:47:10,994
It could be electromagnetic
or visual stimuli.

554
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:14,062
What's running
through that cable?

555
00:47:14,134 --> 00:47:16,305
It's fiber optics.

556
00:47:17,589 --> 00:47:20,011
I don't know
the specifics.

557
00:47:22,102 --> 00:47:25,299
But I do have a friend
who's working on the project.

558
00:47:28,502 --> 00:47:30,128
Chuck:
Prehistoric, huh?

559
00:47:30,199 --> 00:47:32,621
That's right.
Prehistoric.

560
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,407
Damndest thing
I ever heard.

561
00:47:36,472 --> 00:47:39,025
Could the fiber be
emitting something?

562
00:47:39,096 --> 00:47:45,141
Low-level electrical field.
Not enough to harm anything.

563
00:47:45,209 --> 00:47:47,827
But maybe enough
to attract something.

564
00:47:47,897 --> 00:47:51,214
In the '80s, AT&T
had problems with sharks

565
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:53,144
biting though
their fiber cables.

566
00:47:54,649 --> 00:47:57,071
Their cable installation
was too thin.

567
00:47:57,146 --> 00:47:59,699
Electricity bleeding
through the water.

568
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:01,592
The same could be
happening here.

569
00:48:02,618 --> 00:48:05,007
Let me show you something.

570
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:06,872
This section of cable
here in Mexico

571
00:48:06,939 --> 00:48:08,881
connects to North America,
South America,

572
00:48:08,955 --> 00:48:12,817
then 10 miles south, branches off
to Australia and Japan.

573
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,145
The whole system's set
to go online in...

574
00:48:16,219 --> 00:48:17,267
two days.

575
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:21,399
It looks like the cable goes
near several deep-water trenches.

576
00:48:21,468 --> 00:48:23,061
Yeah.

577
00:48:23,132 --> 00:48:25,750
I lost a good buddy
in an accident...

578
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,762
right about here.

579
00:48:27,836 --> 00:48:30,389
Near the Challenger
deep trench.

580
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,697
Yeah, I'm sorry
about that.

581
00:48:33,789 --> 00:48:36,571
We know the Meg's
attracted to the cable.

582
00:48:36,637 --> 00:48:38,743
And with it running
this close to the trenches,

583
00:48:38,814 --> 00:48:42,458
it could have drawn it out of
the deep blue sea and lead it here.

584
00:48:42,526 --> 00:48:44,730
That cable goes to full power,
there is no telling

585
00:48:44,798 --> 00:48:46,741
how many of these Megs
we'll have on our hands.

586
00:48:46,815 --> 00:48:48,637
We can't let
that system go online.

587
00:48:48,702 --> 00:48:50,077
Guys...

588
00:48:51,103 --> 00:48:53,078
you'll have a hard time
convincing Tolley

589
00:48:53,151 --> 00:48:55,540
to delay a billion-dollar
project over...

590
00:48:55,616 --> 00:48:57,307
what, some sharks
and a hunch?

591
00:48:57,376 --> 00:48:59,481
Yeah, he's right.

592
00:48:59,552 --> 00:49:02,007
We don't
have enough proof.

593
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,536
And we have to deal with the Meg
that's out there now.

594
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,038
All right.

595
00:49:06,112 --> 00:49:08,982
I'll check Apex's computer files,
see what I can find.

596
00:49:09,057 --> 00:49:10,650
Do you have access?

597
00:49:11,681 --> 00:49:13,208
I will when
I'm done hacking.

598
00:49:19,714 --> 00:49:21,786
Ben: You know what?

599
00:49:21,857 --> 00:49:24,727
We'll need
all the help we can get.

600
00:49:24,802 --> 00:49:26,329
Let's go.

601
00:49:50,148 --> 00:49:52,352
- Davis: Hey.
- Hey.

602
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:54,493
- You guys take that?
- Yeah.

603
00:49:58,213 --> 00:50:00,515
Yo, easy, easy, easy.

604
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:02,108
Now...

605
00:50:02,181 --> 00:50:04,734
are you sure
this will kill it?

606
00:50:04,805 --> 00:50:08,319
If you want, I can test it out
on Freidman first.

607
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:10,692
I heard that.

608
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:11,903
Smart-ass.

609
00:50:11,974 --> 00:50:13,949
- Is everything stowed?
- Everything's stowed.

610
00:50:14,023 --> 00:50:14,971
Cat: Let's roll.

611
00:50:40,841 --> 00:50:43,263
Come on, baby.
Come on.

612
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:51,048
Here's your password.

613
00:51:07,436 --> 00:51:09,323
"Power bleed-through."

614
00:51:12,972 --> 00:51:15,143
You knew it was leaking.

615
00:51:17,485 --> 00:51:19,852
What else are you hiding,
Tolley?

616
00:51:28,302 --> 00:51:31,117
Son of a bitch!

617
00:51:34,702 --> 00:51:37,866
The Pacific Horizon
is prepared for tomorrow.

618
00:51:37,934 --> 00:51:40,455
What's the final
head count?

619
00:51:40,527 --> 00:51:41,934
46 guests.

620
00:51:41,999 --> 00:51:44,039
46 investors!

621
00:51:44,111 --> 00:51:47,111
You don't throw $100,000
on a party cruise

622
00:51:47,183 --> 00:51:49,158
if they're just guests.

623
00:51:49,232 --> 00:51:51,174
Yes, sir. It'll be
first class all the way.

624
00:51:53,936 --> 00:51:56,042
You fucking knew!

625
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:59,179
Assistant:
Security, get in here!

626
00:51:59,248 --> 00:52:02,380
You knew,
and you didn't warn them?

627
00:52:02,449 --> 00:52:04,456
I don't know what
you're talking about.

628
00:52:04,529 --> 00:52:06,351
Bullshit!

629
00:52:06,418 --> 00:52:08,490
It's all right here.

630
00:52:08,561 --> 00:52:10,285
The diving accidents.

631
00:52:10,354 --> 00:52:12,077
Seven men dead!

632
00:52:12,145 --> 00:52:14,088
Including my friend.

633
00:52:14,162 --> 00:52:16,944
You knew it was dangerous
and you let them dive.

634
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:18,766
They knew it was risky.

635
00:52:18,834 --> 00:52:20,657
Some things weren't
accounted for.

636
00:52:20,723 --> 00:52:22,447
Bull-fucking-shit!

637
00:52:22,515 --> 00:52:24,370
You knew something
was happening!

638
00:52:24,435 --> 00:52:26,061
And you covered it up!

639
00:52:27,475 --> 00:52:29,264
You're finished, Tolley.

640
00:52:29,331 --> 00:52:31,219
When the press
gets a hold of you,

641
00:52:31,284 --> 00:52:33,008
they'll rip you
an new asshole.

642
00:52:33,076 --> 00:52:35,181
Go tell your story.
Who would believe you,

643
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:39,508
a disgruntled employee with
stolen confidential documents?

644
00:52:39,572 --> 00:52:41,645
My lawyers will have
a field day with you.

645
00:52:41,716 --> 00:52:45,492
- They are the real sharks.
- This isn't over yet, Tolley!

646
00:52:45,557 --> 00:52:48,372
- Not by a long shot!
- Get him out of here!

647
00:53:01,206 --> 00:53:03,956
Esai, this is Ben.
Are you there?

648
00:53:04,023 --> 00:53:05,681
Yeah,
go ahead, Ben.

649
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:08,500
Nothing on our end, so far.
Where are you at?

650
00:53:08,567 --> 00:53:11,251
I'm about five miles
south of Peridor.

651
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:14,102
I haven't seen a thing.
Maybe your shark skipped out.

652
00:53:14,168 --> 00:53:17,070
Ben: I doubt it.
Let me know if you see anything.

653
00:53:17,144 --> 00:53:18,038
Okay.

654
00:53:19,608 --> 00:53:20,852
Okay, okay.

655
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,473
West of our position
about one mile.

656
00:53:23,544 --> 00:53:27,123
- All right, I'm on it.
- Ben: Esai, we found it.

657
00:53:27,193 --> 00:53:30,488
We're two miles northwest
of the resort jetty.

658
00:53:30,554 --> 00:53:32,855
- I'm on my way.
- 10-4.

659
00:53:44,635 --> 00:53:46,423
Cat, take this.

660
00:53:50,715 --> 00:53:52,854
Let's get this going.

661
00:53:53,883 --> 00:53:55,923
Come on, you mother.

662
00:53:55,995 --> 00:53:57,556
Come to papa.

663
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:05,141
He's gone under.
Slow down.

664
00:54:09,533 --> 00:54:10,427
Jesus!

665
00:54:15,005 --> 00:54:17,177
Son of a bitch!

666
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,560
Hold on!

667
00:54:36,959 --> 00:54:38,617
- Yes!
- Got it.

668
00:54:43,712 --> 00:54:45,119
Son of a bitch!

669
00:54:52,737 --> 00:54:54,679
Davis, you okay?

670
00:54:54,753 --> 00:54:56,313
Davis?

671
00:54:56,385 --> 00:54:59,004
- I'll get my shotgun.
- Davis, come on.

672
00:54:59,074 --> 00:55:01,081
Come on, don't do this.

673
00:55:01,154 --> 00:55:03,358
- Davis!
- Come on, Davis!

674
00:55:03,426 --> 00:55:05,249
Davis, come on!

675
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,665
( Cat screams )

676
00:56:19,561 --> 00:56:21,122
Help! Help me!

677
00:56:26,538 --> 00:56:28,578
What--? Cat!

678
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:30,559
Cat! Cat!

679
00:56:39,083 --> 00:56:41,539
Don't move!
Stay where you are!

680
00:56:48,684 --> 00:56:51,270
Die, God damn it!
Die!

681
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:54,024
Die!
Son of a bitch!

682
00:56:55,853 --> 00:56:56,747
Die!

683
00:57:02,893 --> 00:57:04,420
Die!

684
00:57:52,209 --> 00:57:54,413
You're extinct,
fucker!

685
00:58:29,365 --> 00:58:31,154
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah.

686
00:58:31,221 --> 00:58:33,393
- Davis, you all right?
- Yeah.

687
00:58:33,462 --> 00:58:35,731
- Oh, shit!
- ( boat horn blows )

688
00:58:35,798 --> 00:58:37,140
Ben: Hey!

689
00:58:39,543 --> 00:58:41,452
Esai!

690
00:58:41,526 --> 00:58:44,014
Esai, we're taking
on water!

691
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:45,974
I'll be right there.

692
00:58:46,039 --> 00:58:47,926
- Esai!
- Over here!

693
00:58:47,992 --> 00:58:50,261
Hey, over here!

694
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:55,635
Sy: Help me!

695
00:58:56,664 --> 00:58:58,355
Holy fucking shit!

696
00:59:24,282 --> 00:59:27,282
Oh my God!
Shit!

697
00:59:37,788 --> 00:59:39,675
Ben:
Get up on top!

698
00:59:41,596 --> 00:59:43,026
Use your feet.

699
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:45,882
They're over there!

700
00:59:54,334 --> 00:59:56,090
- No!
- Oh my God!

701
00:59:58,654 --> 01:00:00,541
( helicopter approaching )

702
01:00:24,416 --> 01:00:25,910
Oh, shit!

703
01:00:47,139 --> 01:00:48,633
What was that?

704
01:00:58,819 --> 01:01:00,707
Look at that.
Look at the tooth.

705
01:01:00,772 --> 01:01:03,838
Look at the size of that.
This is our proof.

706
01:01:04,868 --> 01:01:07,487
I'll hold onto it.
Shit!

707
01:01:15,013 --> 01:01:16,290
Hey!

708
01:01:17,701 --> 01:01:20,003
Don't fall. Hey!

709
01:01:24,006 --> 01:01:25,315
Hurry!

710
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,534
Give me your hand.

711
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:44,607
Just take it easy.

712
01:01:51,528 --> 01:01:53,089
Ben: Hold on!

713
01:01:54,504 --> 01:01:56,097
Don't let go.

714
01:01:57,577 --> 01:01:59,333
Get us out of here!

715
01:02:02,441 --> 01:02:04,263
Ben: Don't let go!

716
01:02:14,187 --> 01:02:15,747
Come on!
Come on!

717
01:02:18,123 --> 01:02:19,432
You got it.

718
01:02:24,652 --> 01:02:25,961
Climb.

719
01:02:40,845 --> 01:02:44,140
- You okay, Ben?
- Yeah.

720
01:02:44,205 --> 01:02:47,981
- What the hell was that?
- You don't want to know.

721
01:03:00,591 --> 01:03:04,366
Esai is dead and
so are two other people!

722
01:03:04,432 --> 01:03:07,945
- What are you talking about?
- Another Megalodon killed them!

723
01:03:08,016 --> 01:03:09,903
Another one? You said
you'd take care of it.

724
01:03:09,968 --> 01:03:11,943
We killed it.
But its mother's huge!

725
01:03:12,016 --> 01:03:14,318
- How big?
- Larger than a Greyhound bus.

726
01:03:14,385 --> 01:03:16,207
- Bullshit!
- Look.

727
01:03:16,272 --> 01:03:19,917
That's what you're dealing with.
You can't keep this quiet.

728
01:03:19,985 --> 01:03:22,374
We have got a 60-foot shark
swimming off our coast

729
01:03:22,449 --> 01:03:25,646
that's not going to go away.
We have to tell the authorities!

730
01:03:25,713 --> 01:03:28,942
And tell the world we've got a
dinosaur swimming off our beaches?

731
01:03:30,002 --> 01:03:32,391
- You won't blow the whistle?
- No.

732
01:03:32,466 --> 01:03:35,532
Fine.
Then I will.

733
01:03:44,915 --> 01:03:46,344
Cat: What happened?

734
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:48,176
- I just quit.
- Are you serious?

735
01:03:48,244 --> 01:03:51,244
- Yeah, I'm serious.
- Hector gave me the news.

736
01:03:51,316 --> 01:03:53,520
- You guys all right?
- We're okay.

737
01:03:53,588 --> 01:03:56,338
Apex knew
about the Megalodons.

738
01:03:56,404 --> 01:03:59,187
Tolley turned a blind eye
and counted his money.

739
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:02,602
- We've got bigger problems.
- You got that right.

740
01:04:02,677 --> 01:04:04,303
I just went to the police but...

741
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:06,642
they don't have
the resources to help out.

742
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:09,327
- What about the Navy?
- I tried.

743
01:04:09,397 --> 01:04:11,951
But Navy won't violate
12-mile limit.

744
01:04:12,022 --> 01:04:14,510
I called the Coast Guard.
They can get a cutter down.

745
01:04:14,582 --> 01:04:16,687
- When?
- Not until the end of next week.

746
01:04:16,758 --> 01:04:18,645
That's not
quick enough.

747
01:04:18,711 --> 01:04:20,118
So what do we do?

748
01:04:22,903 --> 01:04:25,237
We handle it ourselves.

749
01:04:25,303 --> 01:04:27,692
I know where
we can get explosives.

750
01:04:27,767 --> 01:04:29,872
No questions asked.

751
01:04:29,943 --> 01:04:32,594
We'll use the minisub,
plant the charges,

752
01:04:32,664 --> 01:04:34,519
blow the cable
at the junction box.

753
01:04:34,584 --> 01:04:36,624
That'll prevent Apex
from turning on the system.

754
01:04:36,696 --> 01:04:38,802
But we still have to deal
with the Meg.

755
01:04:38,873 --> 01:04:40,913
We know it's attracted
to electricity.

756
01:04:40,985 --> 01:04:42,511
Let's use it
to our advantage.

757
01:04:42,584 --> 01:04:46,676
I could string together a series
of high-voltage batteries.

758
01:04:46,745 --> 01:04:48,600
That'll be enough
to bring him to us.

759
01:04:48,665 --> 01:04:51,961
- And how do we kill it?
- We don't want to wound it

760
01:04:52,025 --> 01:04:54,197
and have it
swim back out to sea.

761
01:04:54,266 --> 01:04:56,754
We want something
that will not miss it.

762
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,761
I got something
you ought to see.

763
01:05:03,675 --> 01:05:05,682
The Mark 44 torpedo.

764
01:05:05,755 --> 01:05:08,276
Taken out of service
15 years ago.

765
01:05:08,347 --> 01:05:11,576
Travels at 55 knots.
Has a range of 10 miles.

766
01:05:11,643 --> 01:05:13,236
Where did you get
that thing?

767
01:05:13,307 --> 01:05:15,795
The last sub I was on
was decommissioned.

768
01:05:15,868 --> 01:05:19,545
Lot of hardware. It's better here
than in a scrap heap.

769
01:05:20,892 --> 01:05:22,453
Does it work?

770
01:05:23,868 --> 01:05:28,211
It'll blow a hole clear through
the hull of a battleship.

771
01:05:28,285 --> 01:05:31,798
- What about a shark?
- Abso-fuckin-lutely.

772
01:05:44,767 --> 01:05:47,134
Okay, so the torpedo's
hooked up and armed.

773
01:05:47,199 --> 01:05:48,312
Are we ready?

774
01:05:48,383 --> 01:05:53,304
The Mark 44 torpedo launch system's
nominal, but-- there's a wrinkle.

775
01:05:53,375 --> 01:05:55,644
It wasn't designed
for a biological target.

776
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:58,046
It needs something
mechanical...

777
01:05:58,112 --> 01:06:00,284
or electrical.

778
01:06:00,352 --> 01:06:02,392
We need to tag
the Meg with this.

779
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:06,746
It'll send out a signal
to the torpedo.

780
01:06:07,872 --> 01:06:09,814
But somebody has
to get close to the shark.

781
01:06:14,145 --> 01:06:16,120
Not necessarily.

782
01:06:17,889 --> 01:06:20,224
Where'd you learn
to use a crossbow?

783
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:22,778
I did a little
deer hunting in my day.

784
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:24,705
All right, you two...

785
01:06:26,051 --> 01:06:27,993
get some sleep.

786
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:29,692
Yes, sir.

787
01:06:29,763 --> 01:06:32,578
We'll meet back here
at 8:00 a.m.

788
01:06:34,051 --> 01:06:35,906
Don't be late.

789
01:06:40,515 --> 01:06:43,811
- I'm exhausted.
- Yeah, me too.

790
01:06:43,876 --> 01:06:45,916
But I'm really wired.

791
01:06:45,988 --> 01:06:48,988
Shall I take you home
and eat your pussy?

792
01:07:59,531 --> 01:08:02,663
Okay. The sardines
are in the can.

793
01:08:02,731 --> 01:08:04,225
Copy that.

794
01:08:04,299 --> 01:08:06,503
We'll shadow you
from above.

795
01:08:06,571 --> 01:08:09,703
- You two be careful down there
- Yeah, we'll be fine.

796
01:08:10,828 --> 01:08:12,006
Okay.

797
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:15,083
Let's get
this circus underway.

798
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:43,079
( lounge music playing )

799
01:09:06,545 --> 01:09:07,974
All right,
talk to me.

800
01:09:08,050 --> 01:09:11,017
The harbor-master has barred
any boats from leaving the bay.

801
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:13,993
- The fine is $5,000.
- Fine, pay it.

802
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:16,718
You know how much
is riding on this today,

803
01:09:16,787 --> 01:09:19,983
how much money is standing
on that boat right now.

804
01:09:20,051 --> 01:09:22,025
That's my future
and yours.

805
01:09:22,099 --> 01:09:24,009
- It'll be fine.
- It better be.

806
01:09:24,083 --> 01:09:25,490
Don't worry.

807
01:09:25,555 --> 01:09:28,970
A friend of mine here has
brought us a little insurance.

808
01:09:30,228 --> 01:09:32,465
Just in case
that shark shows up.

809
01:09:33,972 --> 01:09:34,921
Good.

810
01:09:37,044 --> 01:09:38,124
Let's go.

811
01:09:41,909 --> 01:09:45,171
All right.
We're closing in.

812
01:09:51,125 --> 01:09:53,166
- Ben: Getting close.
- Copy that.

813
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:00,716
- What was that?
- Clear air turbulence.

814
01:10:00,791 --> 01:10:02,733
It happens
when you fly this low.

815
01:10:02,807 --> 01:10:05,043
- You'll get used to it.
- Not likely.

816
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:17,268
Okay, Ben.

817
01:10:18,393 --> 01:10:19,854
It's all yours.

818
01:10:45,627 --> 01:10:47,253
Okay, we're hooked on.

819
01:10:48,379 --> 01:10:49,459
Back away.

820
01:10:49,531 --> 01:10:52,019
Nice and easy.

821
01:11:21,918 --> 01:11:23,544
Piece of cake, right?

822
01:11:48,641 --> 01:11:51,260
Now the dot.coms
are all going under.

823
01:11:52,577 --> 01:11:55,033
Hey, how are you?
Nice to see you.

824
01:11:55,106 --> 01:11:57,594
Hey, how's it going?
I'll see you later.

825
01:11:57,666 --> 01:11:59,454
Hey, how's it going?

826
01:12:01,474 --> 01:12:03,362
Here's the cheers, honey.

827
01:12:09,955 --> 01:12:11,897
Ladies and gentlemen,

828
01:12:11,971 --> 01:12:15,354
if I could have
your attention for a moment?

829
01:12:15,428 --> 01:12:18,330
I would like to thank
all of you for coming on...

830
01:12:18,404 --> 01:12:23,969
what I'm sure will be a landmark
day for Apex Communications.

831
01:12:24,036 --> 01:12:25,924
Today...

832
01:12:25,989 --> 01:12:27,964
we begin official use...

833
01:12:28,036 --> 01:12:31,266
of a new generation
of communication technology.

834
01:12:37,189 --> 01:12:38,564
Okay.

835
01:12:38,629 --> 01:12:40,353
We're clear by now.

836
01:12:47,878 --> 01:12:49,853
You want the honors?

837
01:12:54,279 --> 01:12:56,287
Okay, Porter.

838
01:12:58,535 --> 01:13:00,029
This is for you.

839
01:13:07,336 --> 01:13:09,092
That cable is history.

840
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:11,877
Man: Dude, we just lost
the main junction box.

841
01:13:11,945 --> 01:13:14,334
Man #2: Well, switch
to the backup router.

842
01:13:15,913 --> 01:13:18,848
Man #1: I can't.
There's nothing there.

843
01:13:18,921 --> 01:13:23,112
The whole line's completely dead.
Should we call Tolley?

844
01:13:24,202 --> 01:13:26,406
Not unless you want
to make the call.

845
01:13:34,987 --> 01:13:36,361
Take a look at that.

846
01:13:42,796 --> 01:13:45,611
- We've got a problem.
- Go ahead.

847
01:13:45,676 --> 01:13:48,676
- There's a yacht out on the water.
- The harbor-master was supposed

848
01:13:48,748 --> 01:13:51,945
- to bar all traffic.
- Somebody didn't listen.

849
01:13:52,012 --> 01:13:54,249
Within the next two years,

850
01:13:54,317 --> 01:13:56,772
we plan to build an entire network

851
01:13:56,845 --> 01:13:59,431
of fiber optic cables...

852
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:01,574
spanning the globe

853
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:05,094
and bringing the world together
as never before.

854
01:14:05,166 --> 01:14:06,955
( guests clap )

855
01:14:12,847 --> 01:14:14,756
Ladies and gentlemen,

856
01:14:14,831 --> 01:14:16,522
I propose a toast:

857
01:14:16,591 --> 01:14:19,373
to the future of Apex.

858
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:21,326
Hear, hear!

859
01:14:22,735 --> 01:14:23,629
Cheers.

860
01:14:48,337 --> 01:14:50,476
- Where is your insurance?
- What?

861
01:14:50,546 --> 01:14:52,619
- The fucking grenade!
- It's upstairs.

862
01:14:59,123 --> 01:15:01,359
Mayday! Mayday!
This is the Pacific Horizon.

863
01:15:01,427 --> 01:15:04,394
We've been struck and
the controls are not responding.

864
01:15:04,467 --> 01:15:06,442
- Mayday!
- What's going on?

865
01:15:06,516 --> 01:15:08,174
The shark is attacking
the ship.

866
01:15:34,294 --> 01:15:35,821
Drop the box...

867
01:15:35,894 --> 01:15:38,065
and try to lure the shark away
so you can tag it.

868
01:15:38,134 --> 01:15:41,517
- We're getting there.
- Copy that. I'm dropping the box.

869
01:15:46,103 --> 01:15:47,794
( electric static )

870
01:15:54,937 --> 01:15:56,213
Let's go.

871
01:16:26,811 --> 01:16:29,714
Hold it steady.
Hold it steady.

872
01:16:36,988 --> 01:16:39,671
- Son of a bitch!
- I missed it.

873
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:42,588
Don't worry.
We'll figure something out.

874
01:16:42,652 --> 01:16:45,402
- Here, take the wheel.
- What?

875
01:16:45,468 --> 01:16:47,476
What are you doing?

876
01:16:47,549 --> 01:16:50,484
Always carry a spare.

877
01:16:50,558 --> 01:16:52,467
It's the Navy way.

878
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:56,281
Whoa, Jesus!

879
01:17:12,031 --> 01:17:13,177
Okay.

880
01:17:13,248 --> 01:17:15,255
Time to get wet.

881
01:17:16,064 --> 01:17:17,308
Take the sub.

882
01:17:29,345 --> 01:17:31,614
There it is!
Throw the grenade!

883
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:40,288
Jesus, what the hell
was that?

884
01:17:40,354 --> 01:17:41,783
Toss another one!

885
01:17:53,124 --> 01:17:55,066
God damn it!

886
01:17:57,123 --> 01:17:59,579
One, two, three!

887
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:01,821
Chew on that!

888
01:18:14,309 --> 01:18:15,716
Come on!

889
01:18:15,781 --> 01:18:18,749
Come on!
Come on to daddy!

890
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:22,367
Ben! Ben!

891
01:18:22,438 --> 01:18:24,412
Come in, Ben!
Ben!

892
01:18:30,151 --> 01:18:31,678
Pull up!

893
01:18:33,927 --> 01:18:35,553
Oh, yeah!

894
01:18:41,287 --> 01:18:44,451
I think you just passed
your driving test.

895
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:49,572
All right, kid.
You're on your own.

896
01:20:41,939 --> 01:20:43,794
What--?

897
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:45,583
What?

898
01:20:52,756 --> 01:20:53,739
No!

899
01:20:53,812 --> 01:20:55,667
Oh my God!

900
01:21:05,205 --> 01:21:07,180
Ben! Come in!

901
01:21:07,254 --> 01:21:09,840
- Come in, Ben!
- I will go around again.

902
01:21:37,848 --> 01:21:39,670
Chuck: I'm ready.

903
01:21:39,737 --> 01:21:41,013
Okay.

904
01:21:44,857 --> 01:21:46,003
Damn.

905
01:21:59,515 --> 01:22:01,271
Got him!
Let's get some distance.

906
01:22:07,003 --> 01:22:07,951
Oh shit!

907
01:22:16,924 --> 01:22:18,134
Can't turn!

908
01:22:20,573 --> 01:22:22,940
Up yours, smart-ass!

909
01:22:29,534 --> 01:22:31,989
- Get your ass topside!
- Way to go, Ben.

910
01:22:32,061 --> 01:22:34,483
- I've lost the transmitter.
- Forget about it.

911
01:22:34,558 --> 01:22:37,624
- Get out of there!
- There has to be another way.

912
01:22:37,694 --> 01:22:41,339
There is no other way.
The torpedo needs a signal.

913
01:22:41,407 --> 01:22:44,604
- Wait, I've got an idea.
- What?

914
01:22:44,671 --> 01:22:46,460
I can't explain.

915
01:22:47,871 --> 01:22:50,457
- Just wish me luck.
- All right. You got it.

916
01:23:14,465 --> 01:23:16,854
Boy, do I feel
underdressed.

917
01:23:24,707 --> 01:23:26,747
( alarm sounds )

918
01:23:32,099 --> 01:23:34,488
Come on, come on,
come on.

919
01:23:36,643 --> 01:23:38,334
Come on, baby.

920
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:10,656
Torpedoes away,
motherfucker!

921
01:24:31,401 --> 01:24:33,736
Come on! Come on!

922
01:24:35,689 --> 01:24:37,216
Open, God damn it!

923
01:25:20,941 --> 01:25:22,403
Cat: Ben!

924
01:25:23,662 --> 01:25:25,451
I will call for help.

925
01:25:42,575 --> 01:25:44,364
Ben? Ben?

926
01:25:51,568 --> 01:25:53,292
I got him.

927
01:25:56,849 --> 01:25:58,442
Cat: Got him?

928
01:26:07,346 --> 01:26:09,834
Cat: Move over.

929
01:26:09,906 --> 01:26:11,662
Ben? Ben?

930
01:26:11,730 --> 01:26:14,119
Are you okay?
Ben? Ben?

931
01:26:14,195 --> 01:26:16,584
Listen to me.
Are you okay?

932
01:26:20,403 --> 01:26:22,608
- C'mon, kid.
- Are you okay?

933
01:26:22,676 --> 01:26:24,912
Come on, you're okay.

934
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:26,954
Mega-la-who?

935
01:26:30,356 --> 01:26:32,429
Man!

936
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:35,217
Hey, where are
the cocktails?
