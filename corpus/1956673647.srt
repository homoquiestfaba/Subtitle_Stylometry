1
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,683
(Multicom Jingle)

2
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,820
(somber orchestral music)

3
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:59,876
(strained breaths)

4
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:12,189
(strained breaths)
(thunder rumbles)

5
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:16,079
(suspenseful music)

6
00:01:21,805 --> 00:01:24,722
(strained breaths)

7
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:36,662
(man gasps)
(tense music)

8
00:01:36,662 --> 00:01:38,891
(woman whines)

9
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:40,592
- Please, Papa, don't!

10
00:01:40,592 --> 00:01:42,009
Please, Papa, no!

11
00:01:44,931 --> 00:01:48,098
(man exhales sharply)

12
00:01:52,872 --> 00:01:54,955
(grunts)

13
00:02:03,763 --> 00:02:06,018
(sobs)

14
00:02:06,018 --> 00:02:08,685
(thunder claps)

15
00:02:19,044 --> 00:02:21,044
(pants)

16
00:02:22,904 --> 00:02:26,404
(somber orchestral music)

17
00:02:29,926 --> 00:02:34,926
(wheel creaks)
(hushed prayer)

18
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,620
(thunder claps)

19
00:03:08,226 --> 00:03:10,893
(thunder claps)

20
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,590
- A little closer to him, miss.

21
00:03:28,973 --> 00:03:32,390
Perhaps you could place your hand on his.

22
00:03:38,196 --> 00:03:40,863
(thunder claps)

23
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:46,795
(camera bangs)

24
00:03:46,795 --> 00:03:49,835
(baby cries)

25
00:03:49,835 --> 00:03:52,335
(eerie tones)

26
00:03:55,487 --> 00:03:59,320
(melancholy orchestral music)

27
00:04:08,326 --> 00:04:10,826
(water drips)

28
00:04:36,946 --> 00:04:37,779
- Alice?

29
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:41,311
Alice.

30
00:04:44,906 --> 00:04:47,067
It's time to go, Alice.

31
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:49,317
(chuckles)

32
00:04:56,678 --> 00:04:57,928
(clears throat) Good day.

33
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,603
I'm here for the position of governess.

34
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:15,565
(door creaks)

35
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,140
- The next one is here.

36
00:05:29,755 --> 00:05:32,255
(door creaks)

37
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,493
- Their parents were away onboard a ship,

38
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,683
and there was a terrible accident.

39
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,000
The ship sank with all hands,

40
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,750
and just like that, they were gone.

41
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,410
Both my brother and his
wife, four years ago.

42
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,443
And suddenly I found myself in
charge of two young orphans.

43
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,720
I do have great affection for them,

44
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,530
but I am, after all, a bachelor.

45
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,953
And to be honest with you?

46
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,420
These poor young things
weight heavily on my hands.

47
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,363
They need more than a distant uncle.

48
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,850
In fact, they need someone who
will devote herself to them,

49
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:24,683
heart and soul.

50
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,410
Until recently, they were raised
by an excellent governess,

51
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,700
Miss Jessel, but just as I had
everything running smoothly,

52
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,240
the woman took ill and died.

53
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,890
It was terrible for the children.

54
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,313
Do you like to travel?

55
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,900
- Oh, yes, indeed, sir.

56
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,430
I would be delighted to take the children

57
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,574
anywhere that you would suggest.

58
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,320
(man laughs)

59
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,460
- I'm afraid you don't understand.

60
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:54,463
You will have to travel to
them, they're on an island.

61
00:06:55,450 --> 00:07:00,030
At Raja, a family estate
acquired by my grandfather.

62
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,430
He was set on owning land
in a catholic country.

63
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,320
You are catholic?

64
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,260
- Yes, sir, I am.

65
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,033
- That would've mattered to my brother.

66
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,430
The notion of redemption
through suffering,

67
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,853
fascinates me.

68
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
Though, I myself haven't the conviction.

69
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,370
I do, however, admire
your strength of faith.

70
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,400
- Thank you, sir.

71
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:30,480
- Well, should I give you this position,

72
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,563
you would have to promise to
take complete responsibility.

73
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,380
Never to trouble me with any matters

74
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,200
concerning the children.

75
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,013
Whatever arises, you must handle it alone.

76
00:07:43,013 --> 00:07:45,995
(warm orchestral music)

77
00:07:45,995 --> 00:07:48,493
I know this position would be your first,

78
00:07:50,573 --> 00:07:52,273
and yet, when I look in your eyes,

79
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,693
I believe you would sacrifice
whatever is necessary,

80
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,553
for the good of my niece and nephew.

81
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,293
You can give them something I cannot.

82
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,073
Love.

83
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,313
- I want that more than anything, sir.

84
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,320
- Do I have your word?

85
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,280
- I shall keep the
children happy and well,

86
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,430
as I would my very own.

87
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,170
- The first sacrifice was not so hard.

88
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:30,770
I would like you to have this,
as a token of my gratitude,

89
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,187
and for my faith in you.

90
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:35,015
- Sir.

91
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,662
I do not know what to say.

92
00:08:38,662 --> 00:08:40,245
- Allow me, please.

93
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,653
St. Christopher, the
protector of the Christ child.

94
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,563
To save oneself by saving innocents.

95
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,423
How fitting.

96
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,357
I need you.

97
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:02,891
To help me.

98
00:09:05,752 --> 00:09:07,502
- I promise.

99
00:09:07,502 --> 00:09:10,669
I promise, I shall not disappoint you.

100
00:09:12,883 --> 00:09:16,550
(peaceful orchestral music)

101
00:09:28,512 --> 00:09:31,095
(gulls squawk)

102
00:09:56,123 --> 00:09:58,706
(horse neighs)

103
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,397
(horse neighs)

104
00:10:20,556 --> 00:10:22,570
- [Uncle] St. Christopher.

105
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,270
The protector of the Christ child.

106
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:27,063
To save oneself by saving innocents.

107
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,943
How fitting.

108
00:10:40,452 --> 00:10:41,285
- Stop!

109
00:10:41,285 --> 00:10:42,118
Stop!

110
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,797
I'd like to walk from here.

111
00:11:15,026 --> 00:11:17,609
(gate squeaks)

112
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,245
(gentle breeze blows)

113
00:11:46,426 --> 00:11:48,843
(wings flap)

114
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,260
You must be the housekeeper.

115
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,735
I am, uh--

116
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:17,402
(woman mumbles)

117
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,623
- We were expecting you days ago.

118
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,053
Welcome to Raja.

119
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,943
- Thank you.

120
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,640
I'm so sorry I'm late,
but rough seas delayed us.

121
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,900
I thought we'd never make it to port.

122
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,693
- I'm glad you arrived safely.

123
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,610
I'm the housekeeper, Mado Remei.

124
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,910
- I'm pleased to meet you.

125
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:47,890
- Please, come in.

126
00:12:58,126 --> 00:13:01,810
- It must keep you frightfully busy.

127
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:02,643
- Yes.

128
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,130
(bleak piano music)

129
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,030
(chuckles)

130
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,680
That belongs to my little confit.

131
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,553
Flora!

132
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,243
Your new governess is here!

133
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,803
- How do you do, Flora?

134
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,043
- Say hello.

135
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:39,803
- Hello.

136
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,613
- This must be yours.

137
00:13:52,062 --> 00:13:55,272
- [Remei] You must be
weary from your journey.

138
00:13:55,272 --> 00:13:58,331
- [Governess] I must admit, I am a little.

139
00:13:58,331 --> 00:14:00,748
- I'll take you to your room.

140
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,160
I had Flora choose it for you.

141
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,610
- I'm sure it will be lovely.

142
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:11,704
(owl hoots)

143
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,973
- I hope everything was to your liking.

144
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,043
- Yes, it's all far
grander than I'm used to.

145
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,283
The entire house I grew up in
could fit into this very room.

146
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,463
- This room is only for special occasions.

147
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,503
- But this is a special
occasion, my little confit.

148
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,861
- Not without him, it isn't.

149
00:14:45,861 --> 00:14:47,490
(clock chimes)

150
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,150
- You hear that, Flora?

151
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,650
That means it's time for
you to get ready for bed.

152
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:57,511
- Yes, Mado Remei.

153
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,230
- Your new governess will come
up very soon to tuck you in.

154
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:09,920
(clock chimes)

155
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,560
- Why don't you wait for me,

156
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,360
and we can say our prayers together?

157
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:18,332
(door creaks)

158
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,733
She's such an enchanting girl.

159
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,243
But she seems so sad.

160
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,160
- She's just missing her brother.

161
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:32,103
- Was she close to my
predecessor, the one who died?

162
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,023
- Very close.

163
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,936
- What was she like?

164
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,580
- Miss Jessel?

165
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,933
She was very young.

166
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,573
Some would say pretty.

167
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,623
He seems to prefer them that way.

168
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,620
This letter came for you.

169
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,113
From the Master.

170
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,510
- [Master] To the governess at Raja.

171
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,140
Please find enclosed a letter
from my nephew's headmaster.

172
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,500
Do not bother to consult me.

173
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,643
The children are under your care now.

174
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,894
(Governess sighs)

175
00:16:29,904 --> 00:16:33,530
- Young Miles has been
dismissed from school.

176
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,590
- Dismissed?

177
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,463
- Expelled.

178
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:38,078
(sighs)

179
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:38,911
- Well, what has he done?

180
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,770
- It doesn't say.

181
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:44,590
Only that it is impossible
to keep him any longer.

182
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:49,030
That the child is undesirable
and an injury to the others.

183
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,060
- How could they be so cruel as to

184
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,896
write something like that?

185
00:16:52,896 --> 00:16:54,833
- (sighs) It is hard to believe.

186
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,405
I suppose I should
write to the headmaster.

187
00:16:59,405 --> 00:17:01,010
- Nonsense, miss.

188
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,163
Wait till you meet him.

189
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,200
- But he must have done something.

190
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:09,437
Something to contaminate the others.

191
00:17:09,437 --> 00:17:10,960
- "Contaminate?"

192
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,803
- Corrupt.

193
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,560
- Miles?

194
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,923
He's only a child.

195
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:19,793
Are you afraid he might corrupt you, miss?

196
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:30,458
- If you'll excuse me,
I must see to Flora.

197
00:17:32,736 --> 00:17:33,736
- Goodnight.

198
00:17:35,415 --> 00:17:38,336
(door creaks)

199
00:17:38,336 --> 00:17:43,336
(bleak orchestral music)
(door creaks)

200
00:17:56,225 --> 00:17:57,058
- Flora.

201
00:18:03,804 --> 00:18:07,637
(music box chimes peacefully)

202
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,602
(door creaks)

203
00:19:01,736 --> 00:19:06,736
(faint moans)
(dark orchestral music)

204
00:19:18,037 --> 00:19:22,954
(strained breaths)
(moans)

205
00:19:26,678 --> 00:19:28,565
(father gasps)

206
00:19:28,565 --> 00:19:30,565
(pants)

207
00:19:36,437 --> 00:19:39,854
(Flora hums melodically)

208
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,323
- She's my new governess, but
she's not as pretty as you.

209
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,463
- Good morning, Flora.

210
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,397
I've just arrived here
in this big, big house,

211
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,143
and I keep getting lost.

212
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,330
Do you know anyone who
could help me find my way?

213
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,380
What about your friend?

214
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,063
- She can't hear you, she's dead.

215
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,833
- Oh, well, that's a pity.

216
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,113
You'll need somebody to take her place.

217
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,963
I've had her since I was your age,

218
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,030
but I think she wants to be yours.

219
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,887
- Thank you.

220
00:21:07,687 --> 00:21:09,440
What's that?

221
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,273
- Nothing.

222
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,330
Would you like to show me the house?

223
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,563
She's dying of curiosity.

224
00:21:19,815 --> 00:21:22,215
- There's so much to see,
where should we start?

225
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,060
- Well, why don't you start

226
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,462
by showing me your favorite place?

227
00:21:27,462 --> 00:21:28,450
- All right.

228
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,283
(Governess chuckles)

229
00:21:29,283 --> 00:21:30,931
Follow me.

230
00:21:30,931 --> 00:21:34,014
(Governess chuckles)

231
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,364
This is the music room.

232
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,947
(piano drones)

233
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,393
You can see the whole garden from here.

234
00:21:51,873 --> 00:21:53,770
Here is the desk, it could be your desk!

235
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,120
And that is the blackboard.

236
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,982
We used to have class here.

237
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:02,890
The wind makes it hum.

238
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,333
Miles calls it the Rajan
Nocturne in E-flat.

239
00:22:11,745 --> 00:22:16,745
(rudimentary piano music)
(hums melodically)

240
00:22:27,223 --> 00:22:29,943
(piano drones)

241
00:22:29,943 --> 00:22:32,443
(door creaks)

242
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,495
I wish Miles were here.

243
00:22:38,495 --> 00:22:42,328
(melancholy orchestral music)

244
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,263
This is my collection of shells.

245
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,330
- What is this room, Flora?

246
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,709
- It's Uncle's.

247
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:23,659
It's always locked.

248
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,517
But I know where Mado Remei keeps the key.

249
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,444
Do you like secrets?

250
00:23:35,257 --> 00:23:37,424
- Well, yes, I suppose so.

251
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,737
- Listen.

252
00:23:41,737 --> 00:23:43,949
(faint wind blows)

253
00:23:43,949 --> 00:23:47,032
(Governess chuckles)

254
00:23:48,937 --> 00:23:50,104
I'll show you.

255
00:23:54,018 --> 00:23:57,851
(melancholy orchestral music)

256
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:02,500
(Governess chuckles)

257
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,497
Come on, come on!

258
00:24:05,497 --> 00:24:06,789
(Governess chuckles)

259
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:11,629
Come on! (laughs)

260
00:24:11,629 --> 00:24:16,629
- Whoops! (chuckles)
(Flora laughs)

261
00:24:28,193 --> 00:24:30,860
(Flora giggles)

262
00:24:33,593 --> 00:24:36,176
(gulls squawk)

263
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,298
- Isn't it beautiful?

264
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:47,881
I come here to bury my secrets.

265
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:53,180
You're not going to leave, are you?

266
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,910
- What makes you ask that?

267
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,560
- You had a bad night, I
could hear you moving about.

268
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,867
I thought maybe you didn't like it here.

269
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:03,540
- No, I love it here.

270
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,270
It was nothing, just too much excitement

271
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,220
for one who's never been abroad before.

272
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,443
- Perhaps I should move
my bed into your room.

273
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,240
- Would you like that?

274
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,960
- That way, I could
watch over you at night,

275
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,310
and make sure you aren't frightened.

276
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,683
The house can be quite
scary when it creaks.

277
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,173
- I think that's a good idea.

278
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,510
- I know who gave you this.

279
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,053
- Do you?

280
00:25:33,978 --> 00:25:35,060
- Yes.

281
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,420
I can keep a secret, too.

282
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:41,253
(Governess and Flora chuckle)

283
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:45,852
(Flora laughs)

284
00:25:48,212 --> 00:25:51,612
- I win. (chuckles)

285
00:25:51,612 --> 00:25:52,445
To bed.

286
00:26:06,677 --> 00:26:08,263
- Look what's in my magic box.

287
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,920
- Does it have a name?

288
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,737
- Ophelia, Miles gave her to me.

289
00:26:19,737 --> 00:26:21,410
I can't wait for you to meet him.

290
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,340
You'll like Miles, he's clever.

291
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,850
- And as good as you are, I'm sure.

292
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,910
- I'm afraid we can be
a bit naughty at times.

293
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:32,410
Perhaps now that you're here
he won't have to go away again.

294
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,243
- I hope not.

295
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,910
- Please don't tell Mado Remei

296
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,070
I'm taking her to bed with me.

297
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,493
She doesn't allow it.

298
00:26:40,113 --> 00:26:42,937
- Well, maybe just for tonight.

299
00:26:42,937 --> 00:26:46,437
Now, Flora, it's time to say your prayers.

300
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,010
- Our Father, who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name.

301
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,940
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,

302
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,453
on earth, as it is in heaven.
(wings flap)

303
00:26:56,453 --> 00:26:58,526
Give us this day our daily bread,

304
00:26:58,526 --> 00:27:00,475
and forgive us our trespasses,
(dove squeaks)

305
00:27:00,475 --> 00:27:02,046
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

306
00:27:02,046 --> 00:27:02,879
- Flora.

307
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:07,897
Flora, what, what's wrong with her?

308
00:27:07,897 --> 00:27:11,537
- Miles broke her wing
so she would fly away.

309
00:27:11,537 --> 00:27:13,297
Give us this day our daily bread,

310
00:27:13,297 --> 00:27:14,817
and forgive us our trespasses,

311
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:16,407
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

312
00:27:16,407 --> 00:27:20,723
And lead us, not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

313
00:27:28,266 --> 00:27:29,756
Miles!

314
00:27:29,756 --> 00:27:30,589
Miles!

315
00:27:32,386 --> 00:27:34,553
(giggles)

316
00:27:35,807 --> 00:27:37,974
(giggles)

317
00:27:44,276 --> 00:27:46,526
(chuckles)

318
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,660
All week, I've had
butterflies in my stomach,

319
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,157
just waiting to see you.

320
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,460
Look, your trousers are too short!

321
00:27:59,807 --> 00:28:01,457
This is our new governess!

322
00:28:01,457 --> 00:28:02,583
- Hello, Miles.

323
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,820
- I'm very pleased to meet you.

324
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,970
- The pleasure is mine.

325
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:13,953
- You're even more lovely than I imagined.

326
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:20,944
Mado Remei!
(warm orchestral music)

327
00:28:46,154 --> 00:28:47,746
(Governess sniffs)

328
00:28:47,746 --> 00:28:50,930
One, two, three, four.
(Flora giggles)

329
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:55,500
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

330
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,346
11, 12.

331
00:28:57,346 --> 00:28:58,906
13, 14.

332
00:28:58,906 --> 00:28:59,739
15, 16.

333
00:29:00,714 --> 00:29:01,547
17, 18.

334
00:29:02,472 --> 00:29:05,506
19, and 20!
(Flora giggles)

335
00:29:05,506 --> 00:29:08,506
(muffled footsteps)

336
00:29:18,878 --> 00:29:21,628
(windows rattle)

337
00:29:36,366 --> 00:29:38,690
Am I disturbing you?

338
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:39,567
- No, not at all.

339
00:29:42,426 --> 00:29:43,259
Where's Flora?

340
00:29:44,348 --> 00:29:45,598
- Trying to hide from me.

341
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:48,580
- Well, don't keep the lady waiting.

342
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,530
- I'm not so fond of that game anymore.

343
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:59,270
- Did you have a good time at school?

344
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,920
- I'm happier to be back at Raja.

345
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,010
- Why? Were you not happy?

346
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,060
Did you like the other boys?

347
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,893
- Most of them.

348
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,960
But you can't like everybody, can you?

349
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,387
- No.

350
00:30:16,387 --> 00:30:17,437
Though, one must try.

351
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,280
And what about the masters?

352
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,463
- It must be nice out in the garden now.

353
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,560
- It's far too dark to be pleasant.

354
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,703
- I like it this way.

355
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:33,060
Are you afraid of the dark?

356
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,060
(brooding orchestral music)

357
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,063
- Sometimes.

358
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,693
- Why?

359
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,460
- [Governess] I suppose
there isn't anything

360
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,513
to be afraid of.

361
00:30:44,198 --> 00:30:45,753
- But you seem to be.

362
00:30:45,753 --> 00:30:50,453
Even though everything's the
same by night, as it is by day.

363
00:30:57,026 --> 00:30:57,943
You'll see.

364
00:31:02,289 --> 00:31:05,456
(Governess gasps)
Shh.

365
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,033
Trust me.

366
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,443
Outside, there is the garden.

367
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:23,403
With fountains along the
stairs guarded by stone lions.

368
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,253
The lake is beyond.

369
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,733
And the trees where all the
birds have gone to sleep.

370
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,763
And the crickets will soon be awake.

371
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,380
And past the woods, there is the sea.

372
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,913
And with your eyes still closed,

373
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,233
other things seem to be awakening.

374
00:31:57,678 --> 00:32:01,820
(Governess breaths deeply)

375
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,653
Don't they?

376
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:30,903
Then I light a lamp, and here we are.

377
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,823
Just as we were.

378
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,270
You see?

379
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,770
Your fears are all in what
you think might happen.

380
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,623
Most of the time, nothing does.

381
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,243
Simple as that.

382
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,120
- You have a remarkable
mind, for such a young man.

383
00:32:51,588 --> 00:32:52,421
- Do I?

384
00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:01,791
- Miles?

385
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:03,041
- Yes, my dear?

386
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,323
- Nothing.

387
00:33:07,991 --> 00:33:11,977
- [Flora] Come on, Miles,
I've been waiting forever!

388
00:33:11,977 --> 00:33:14,350
- Go on, play with your sister.

389
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:17,264
- Coming!

390
00:33:18,991 --> 00:33:23,391
I'm glad my uncle chose you.

391
00:33:23,391 --> 00:33:26,250
I'll catch you, you little monster!

392
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,393
- Miles, slow down!

393
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,963
They bring life into this house.

394
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,520
- He is the most astonishing
boy I've ever met.

395
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,920
I can see why the school
masters wouldn't understand him.

396
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,710
He's very special.

397
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,960
- What about that terrible
letter from school?

398
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,700
- It must have been a misunderstanding.

399
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,773
Anyway, I'll hear his side before I judge.

400
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,510
- What will you say to his uncle?

401
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,063
- Not a word.

402
00:34:01,063 --> 00:34:04,573
He expects me to deal with it,
and that is what I have done.

403
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,750
We shall see things out together.

404
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,420
- We shall see things out together.

405
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,910
(peaceful orchestral music)
♪ Ring-a-ring o' roses ♪

(water splashes)

411
00:34:50,117 --> 00:34:52,737
- [Governess] "It would be as
charming as a charming story,

412
00:34:52,737 --> 00:34:54,123
"suddenly to meet someone.

413
00:34:55,357 --> 00:34:57,967
"Someone would appear there
at the turn of a path,

414
00:34:57,967 --> 00:35:00,793
"and would stand before
me and smile and approve.

"I didn't ask more than that.

416
00:35:04,777 --> 00:35:06,863
"I only asked that he should know,

417
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:11,503
"and the only way to be sure
he knew, would be to see it,

418
00:35:11,503 --> 00:35:15,177
"and the kind of light of
it in his handsome face."

419
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:30,791
- Don't be afraid.

420
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,497
He likes you.

421
00:35:39,902 --> 00:35:42,158
(wings flap)

422
00:35:42,158 --> 00:35:43,491
Look over there!

423
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:46,283
- "I only ask that he should know,

424
00:35:47,628 --> 00:35:50,693
"and the only way be sure
he knew, would be to see it,

425
00:35:50,693 --> 00:35:54,150
"and the kind of light of
it in his handsome face."

426
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,250
- [Remei] There is a letter for you, miss.

427
00:35:58,730 --> 00:35:59,563
- Thank you.

428
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,450
The Master's coming to visit.

429
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:13,743
- Hm, when?

430
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,523
- The 27th.

431
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,370
Oh, my goodness, that's in two days.

432
00:36:19,284 --> 00:36:20,860
He says that he's looking
forward to spending some time

433
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:24,633
with the children, and seeing
how we're all getting on.

434
00:36:24,633 --> 00:36:27,053
- You do look very pleased, miss.

435
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,345
- I just hope that he'll
be satisfied with me.

436
00:36:31,345 --> 00:36:34,713
- I'm sure he will be, the
children have never been happier.

437
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:41,123
Well, I must have the
maids ready his room.

438
00:36:52,062 --> 00:36:53,700
(door creaks)

439
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,803
- You go and get the maids,
and I shall air the room.

440
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,240
- Yes, miss.

441
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:13,794
(brooding orchestral music)

442
00:38:32,316 --> 00:38:34,816

(Governess grunts)
(door rattles)

455
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,392
- [Governess] Where is he?

456
00:41:23,024 --> 00:41:25,524
(tense music)

457
00:41:31,657 --> 00:41:36,574

(moans)

460
00:41:47,554 --> 00:41:49,742
- [Man] You like him, don't you?

461
00:41:49,742 --> 00:41:52,083
Don't you?
- Please, I'm a dove!

462
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:53,874
(sobs)
(children giggle)

463
00:41:53,874 --> 00:41:55,976
I didn't do it, I didn't do it!

464
00:41:55,976 --> 00:41:57,642
(children laugh)

465
00:41:57,642 --> 00:41:59,725
(groans)

466
00:42:18,965 --> 00:42:20,146
- There he is!

467
00:42:20,146 --> 00:42:21,653
I see the carriage!

468
00:42:21,653 --> 00:42:24,186
He's coming, Uncle's coming!

469
00:42:24,186 --> 00:42:26,197
Yes, he's coming!

470
00:42:26,197 --> 00:42:28,114
- Yes.
- Uncle's coming!

471
00:42:29,314 --> 00:42:32,314
(door creaks)

472
00:42:32,314 --> 00:42:35,626
- He's coming, he's coming, he's coming!

473
00:42:35,626 --> 00:42:38,087
He's coming, he's coming!

474
00:42:38,087 --> 00:42:39,615
- [Miles] He's coming!

475
00:42:39,615 --> 00:42:40,865
Uncle's coming!

476
00:42:46,646 --> 00:42:48,103
(Remei chuckles)

477
00:42:48,103 --> 00:42:50,090
- Is everything ready?

478
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:51,290
- Yes, miss.

479
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:55,169
The tea is set in the drawing
room, for you and the Master.

480
00:42:55,169 --> 00:42:56,069
Just as you asked.

481
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:02,478
- Uncle!

482
00:43:02,478 --> 00:43:03,556
- Uncle!
- Uncle!

483
00:43:03,556 --> 00:43:04,807
Uncle!
- Uncle!

484
00:43:04,807 --> 00:43:09,807
- Uncle!
- Uncle!

485
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:25,982
(coachman speaks foreign language)

486
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,693
- What does this mean?

487
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,723
Where is he?

488
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:38,630
- Cameo says he is not coming.

489
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:41,357
There is only that which
you have in your hand.

490
00:43:41,357 --> 00:43:43,530
- I knew he wouldn't.

491
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:44,753
He's always too busy.

492
00:44:01,427 --> 00:44:03,837
- "Please find enclosed, a package,

493
00:44:03,837 --> 00:44:06,167
"left at my office to be forwarded to you.

494
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:08,667
"As for me, an unexpected trip to Morocco

495
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:10,903
"makes it impossible for me to visit.

496
00:44:12,177 --> 00:44:13,767
"Please give my love to the children,

497
00:44:13,767 --> 00:44:16,197
"and my regards to Mado Remei.

498
00:44:16,197 --> 00:44:19,507
"Tell them I shall do my best
to be there for Christmas."

499
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:23,303
Morocco?

500
00:44:26,673 --> 00:44:29,340
(fire crackles)

501
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:37,672
(footsteps approach)

502
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:55,103
- I don't suppose my uncle
cares much about Flora, or me.

503
00:44:58,252 --> 00:44:59,797
- You mustn't believe that.

504
00:45:01,092 --> 00:45:03,593
Your uncle has important responsibilities.

505
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,293
- More important than wasting time on us?

506
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:09,683
- No, Miles.

507
00:45:13,361 --> 00:45:16,020
- I understand.
(eerie music)

508
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:19,313
But it's sad, you know, when
people don't have time for you.

509
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:27,849
- I have time.

510
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:42,453
- I feel quite the master of the house,

511
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,003
being here like this, with you.

512
00:45:45,915 --> 00:45:47,994
(Governess chuckles)

513
00:45:47,994 --> 00:45:49,094
- And I, the mistress.

514
00:45:52,685 --> 00:45:54,185
- Would you like a cup of tea?

515
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:59,163
- Yes, that would be nice, but
I think this tea's cold now.

516
00:46:01,696 --> 00:46:04,496
- Then I'll get one of the
maids to make us a fresh pot.

517
00:46:09,985 --> 00:46:12,902
(footsteps recede)

518
00:46:14,686 --> 00:46:17,519
(windows clatter)

519
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:26,751
(ominous tones)

520
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:29,751
(Governess screams)

521
00:46:36,476 --> 00:46:38,809
(owl hoots)

522
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,340
- What happened, miss?

523
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,240
What's the matter?

524
00:46:50,442 --> 00:46:52,400
You're as white as a sheet.

525
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,670
- I have just seen a strange man,

526
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:58,173
staring at me through the window,
as if looking for someone.

527
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,650
- [Remei] What did he look like?

528
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:03,523
- He was tall, with long dark hair.

529
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,513
And cold, vicious eyes.

530
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:11,210
Yes.

531
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:13,530
I've seen him before,
there's a picture of him

532
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,911
with the Master in the Master's study.

533
00:47:15,911 --> 00:47:17,711
- [Remei] It cannot be.

534
00:47:17,711 --> 00:47:18,544
- You know him?

535
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,093
- Fosc.

536
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,023
- Who's Fosc?

537
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:29,650
- He was the Master's valet,
when the Master was here.

538
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:32,460
And a caretaker in
charge, when he was not.

539
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:33,960
- Yes.

540
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,110
Yes, then that was him.

541
00:47:36,122 --> 00:47:38,583
And I saw him the other
day, walking in the garden.

542
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:41,593
- You couldn't have, miss.

543
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,163
Fosc is dead.

544
00:47:45,482 --> 00:47:47,730
- Dead?
(somber orchestral music)

545
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:49,090
- Yes.

546
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:49,923
He is dead.

547
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,240
- [Flora] Oh, a picture.

548
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,770
May I see it?

549
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:32,373
- You're supposed to be asleep.

550
00:48:33,301 --> 00:48:34,621
- Who is that?

551
00:48:34,621 --> 00:48:36,700
- [Governess] My papa.

552
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:37,903
- Where is he now?

553
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,050
- He's dead, Flora.

554
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:45,693
- Don't feel sad.

555
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,730
Miles says the dead only truly die

556
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:50,440
when you forget about them.

557
00:48:58,399 --> 00:48:59,232
There.

558
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,347
To watch over your dreams.

559
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:09,109
(sullen orchestral music)

560
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:08,987
(strained breaths)

561
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,357
(strained breaths)

562
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:44,204
(thunder rumbles)

563
00:50:46,279 --> 00:50:48,946
(rain splashes)

564
00:50:59,316 --> 00:51:01,733
- What happens after you die?

565
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:05,323
- Now, Miles, you know the
answer to that question.

566
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:08,950
- I know that if I'm good, God
will take my soul to heaven,

567
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:12,113
and that if I'm bad, he'll send
me to hell to burn forever.

568
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:16,117
But what if he decides to resurrect me,

569
00:51:16,117 --> 00:51:19,560
and leave me here, to walk around?

570
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,510
Isn't that what happens to some people?

571
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,590
- What do you mean?

572
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,830
- I mean like Lazarus.

573
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:39,040
Why did God resurrect him
instead of taking him to heaven?

574
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,990
He was a good man, wasn't he?

575
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,480
- Was Lazarus a ghost?

576
00:51:44,429 --> 00:51:46,979
- There's no such thing as ghosts, Flora.

577
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:48,660
- Yes, there is.

578
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,960
- What makes you say that?

579
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,857
- Because I've see--
- It says so in the Bible.

580
00:51:52,857 --> 00:51:54,810
"Father, son and Holy Ghost."

581
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:58,369
- Yes, but in that case,
"ghost" means spirit.

582
00:51:58,369 --> 00:52:00,330
- Then why doesn't it say spirit?

583
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:02,713
- Because sometimes, things
have more than one meaning.

584
00:52:13,093 --> 00:52:13,926
"Ghost.

585
00:52:15,145 --> 00:52:17,228
"One, the spirit or soul.

586
00:52:18,097 --> 00:52:21,063
"Two, or haunting memory.

587
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:26,187
"And three, the supposed
spirit of a dead person,

588
00:52:26,187 --> 00:52:28,997
"appearing to the living
as a shadowy apparition."

589
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,945
- If ghosts don't exist, then
why are they in the lexicon?

590
00:52:33,945 --> 00:52:36,778
(thunder rumbles)

591
00:52:38,716 --> 00:52:41,564
- Hail Mary, full of grace.
- Hail Mary, full of grace.

592
00:52:41,564 --> 00:52:46,076
(Governess and Remei mumble)

593
00:52:46,076 --> 00:52:46,909
- Amen.

594
00:52:51,764 --> 00:52:54,597
(Governess sighs)

595
00:52:56,076 --> 00:52:59,409
(faint heartbeat thuds)

596
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,293
- I didn't imagine him.

597
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,333
- Miss?

598
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:21,970
- The man at the window.

599
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,723
I cannot put the sight
of him from my mind.

600
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,300
- You shouldn't do this to yourself, miss.

601
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:32,920
- What kind of a man was Fosc?

602
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:36,693
- He was a callous man.

603
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,253
A man of violence and vice.

604
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,450
I wasn't the only one who detested him.

605
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:46,023
The maids, coachmen.

606
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:48,473
Even the villagers.

607
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:53,057
- The children have never mentioned him.

608
00:53:53,057 --> 00:53:54,617
- Nor should you, miss.

609
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:58,223
It was Miles who found him dead,

610
00:54:00,758 --> 00:54:04,730
at the bottom of the garden
staircase, with a broken neck.

611
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,313
A drunken fall, I'm sure.

612
00:54:10,149 --> 00:54:13,543
Poor Miles was beside himself with grief.

613
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,680
He worshiped the man.
(somber orchestral music)

614
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,477
- My Miles, with that man?

615
00:54:19,717 --> 00:54:20,883
- Who could blame him?

616
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:25,243
A lonely boy with nothing
but a distant uncle.

617
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:29,917
Fosc took advantage.

618
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:35,153
Made me sick to see Miles
following after him like a shadow.

619
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:37,990
- Did you not say something?

620
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:42,873
- Have you never been afraid, miss?

621
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,017
Fosc was a powerful man.

622
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:49,970
- And what of Miss Jessel?

623
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:51,783
The children were under her care.

624
00:54:52,757 --> 00:54:54,313
Did she not do anything?

625
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:58,053
- Miss Jessel was just as bad as he was.

626
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:01,912
- What are you saying?

627
00:55:03,069 --> 00:55:07,429
- Fosc would come to her at night.

628
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:10,679
In the next room were the two children.

629
00:55:13,094 --> 00:55:14,927
In the very next room.

630
00:55:17,424 --> 00:55:21,290
There were many mornings
that I had to tend her.

631
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:23,500
The man brutalized her.

632
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,073
He will no longer prey on anyone.

633
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:27,323
God forgive me.

634
00:55:28,969 --> 00:55:31,052
And I am glad he is dead.

635
00:55:33,641 --> 00:55:38,641
(Flora screams wildly)
(tense music)

636
00:55:39,249 --> 00:55:42,041
- You killed her!
- It was an accident!

637
00:55:42,041 --> 00:55:45,369
(Flora screams wildly)

638
00:55:45,369 --> 00:55:48,408
- Miles, Miles!
(Flora screams)

639
00:55:48,408 --> 00:55:50,241
Don't you ever lay your hands on her!

640
00:55:50,241 --> 00:55:51,449
You do not hit your sister!

641
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:53,049
- She's a liar!

642
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:54,041
- Apologize!

643
00:55:54,041 --> 00:55:55,049
- I won't!

644
00:55:55,049 --> 00:55:57,382
- Then you'll go to
bed without any supper!

645
00:55:57,382 --> 00:56:00,029
- Maybe you just want me to be bad!

646
00:56:00,029 --> 00:56:05,029
(Flora sobs)
(sullen orchestral music)

647
00:56:22,097 --> 00:56:25,597

(wind blows)

655

(eerie tones)

656
00:57:41,764 --> 00:57:42,597
Flora.

657
00:57:44,025 --> 00:57:45,442
Come, my darling.

658
00:57:48,273 --> 00:57:49,690
Come, my darling.

659
00:57:51,432 --> 00:57:53,847
Come to me, come to me.

660
00:57:53,847 --> 00:57:55,233
- [Governess] Flora, stop!

661
00:57:58,380 --> 00:57:59,213
- She's gone.

662
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:01,173
- Who's gone?

663
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:03,800
- Ophelia.

664
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,672
- Didn't you see her?

665
00:58:05,672 --> 00:58:07,840
(sullen orchestral music)

666
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,673
The woman.

667
00:58:09,792 --> 00:58:10,875
- What woman?

668
00:58:15,254 --> 00:58:17,754
(clock ticks)

669
00:58:26,309 --> 00:58:29,392
(footsteps approach)

670
00:58:45,449 --> 00:58:47,209
- Goodness, miss.

671
00:58:47,209 --> 00:58:50,290
What are you doing here in the dark?

672
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:52,587
- I saw the other one.

673
00:58:52,587 --> 00:58:54,087
- "The other one?"

674
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:58,870
- A woman, dressed in
black, watching Flora.

675
00:58:58,870 --> 00:58:59,733
Miss Jessel.

676
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,380
- That's impossible, miss.

677
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:06,300
- I tell you, I saw her in broad daylight.

678
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,263
Luring Flora toward the water.

679
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:11,930
- Did Flora see her, too?

680
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:12,763
- Yes.

681
00:59:13,627 --> 00:59:15,183
But she pretended not to.

682
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,630
- Why would she lie to you, miss?

683
00:59:21,129 --> 00:59:24,973
- Because she keeps many
secrets with her old governess.

684
00:59:25,827 --> 00:59:27,127
- [Remei] "Keeps secrets?"

685
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:32,873
- You said the children were
close to Fosc and that woman.

686
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:36,360
What kind of a hold did they have on them?

687
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:41,773
- They are good children, miss.

688
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:48,350
- I must know what went on in this house.

689
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:50,003
What did the children see?

690
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:53,693
- I do not know what they saw.

691
00:59:55,810 --> 00:59:59,873
They were always closing doors
on me, whispering together.

692
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:07,310
One day, I saw the four
them go into that very room.

693
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:09,763
For hours.

694
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,703
And it was not the sounds
of the piano I heard.

695
01:00:17,918 --> 01:00:18,751
- And?

696
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:22,723
- After that, Miss Jessel held
the girl very close to her.

697
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:28,190
While the boy had gone
to the tower with Fosc.

698
01:00:29,057 --> 01:00:30,363
- And you let this go on?

699
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:32,913
- Did not go on for long.

700
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:35,773
Fosc was soon dead.

701
01:00:38,655 --> 01:00:40,405
- And what became of the governess?

702
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:45,973
- With him gone, she began to waste away.

703
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:49,940
You would've thought she would
be happy to be rid of him,

704
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:54,483
but she was consumed
with the blackest grief.

705
01:00:55,758 --> 01:00:58,193
She couldn't eat or sleep.

706
01:01:01,227 --> 01:01:02,613
When the fever got her...

707
01:01:05,907 --> 01:01:07,503
There was no help to be found.

708
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:13,313
The people on the island shun the sick.

709
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:15,603
Especially her kind.

710
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,123
- They are still here.

711
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:22,183
Both of them.

712
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,873
- The dead are dead, miss.

713
01:01:29,067 --> 01:01:32,843
There is nothing they can do
to harm the living anymore.

714
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:37,957
(sullen orchestral music)

715
01:01:42,909 --> 01:01:46,659
(Miles squawks and whooshes)

716
01:01:48,107 --> 01:01:50,580
(knocks)

717
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:51,633
- Yes, come in.

718
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:02,510
- Do you want to come out and play, Miles?

719
01:02:03,709 --> 01:02:05,359
- I thought I was being punished?

720
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,113
- Yes.

721
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:11,663
But your punishment has
gone on long enough.

722
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,833
- Sorry I didn't apologize to Flora.

723
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:20,103
Sometimes, I get so angry,

724
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:22,137
I don't know what to do with it all.

725
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,750
- It's a beautiful day, Miles.

726
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:32,079
Why don't you go and
play with your sister?

727
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:37,079
(children laugh)
(eerie orchestral music)

728
01:02:52,857 --> 01:02:55,607
(children laugh)

729
01:02:59,816 --> 01:03:01,038
- [Remei] Flora?

730
01:03:01,038 --> 01:03:02,175
Miles?

731
01:03:02,175 --> 01:03:03,656
Tea is ready!

732
01:03:03,656 --> 01:03:05,156
- Coming!
- Coming!

733
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,740
- [Remei] It was Miles who found him dead,

734
01:03:21,832 --> 01:03:25,510
at the bottom of the garden
stairs, with a broken neck.

735
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:40,620
- Do you remember your old governess?

736
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:45,820
What was she like?

737
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:47,280
- She was pretty.

738
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,800
She had beautiful blue
eyes and a funny smile.

739
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,053
She liked music.

740
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:56,033
She used to tell me the stories.

741
01:03:56,033 --> 01:03:58,180
- What kind of stories?

742
01:03:58,180 --> 01:04:00,560
- Her favorite was about
Flora Bella, a little girl who

743
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:03,440
suffered terribly, but
finally, a young prince came

744
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,240
and carried her off to live
in the land of the pink sky.

745
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:12,180
- When was the last time
you saw Miss Jessel?

746
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:16,910
Where was it, darling?

747
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:19,150
- At my secret place.

748
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:20,173
She was crying.

749
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:23,143
She promised she'd never leave me.

750
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:25,600
That she'd always protect me.

751
01:04:27,963 --> 01:04:29,713
Mado Remei didn't like her, though.

752
01:04:31,403 --> 01:04:32,703
- What makes you say that?

753
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,523
- I think she was jealous of her.

754
01:04:43,363 --> 01:04:46,432
Promise you won't ever leave.

755
01:04:46,432 --> 01:04:48,489
- Oh, I promise.

756
01:04:48,489 --> 01:04:49,322
I promise.

757
01:04:50,883 --> 01:04:51,883
Never, ever.

758
01:04:59,081 --> 01:05:01,664
(distant sobs)

759
01:05:20,561 --> 01:05:23,193
(distant sobs)

760
01:05:23,193 --> 01:05:25,693
(tense music)

761
01:05:30,494 --> 01:05:33,077
(distant sobs)

762
01:06:02,092 --> 01:06:04,509
(woman sobs)

763
01:06:22,732 --> 01:06:24,815
- You naughty, bad thing.

764
01:06:25,782 --> 01:06:27,652
You promised you wouldn't leave me.

765
01:06:27,652 --> 01:06:30,132
- Flora, what are you doing out of bed?

766
01:06:30,132 --> 01:06:32,090
- There's someone outside.

767
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:33,360
I think it's Miles.

768
01:06:34,252 --> 01:06:37,585
(dark orchestral music)

769
01:06:53,227 --> 01:06:54,060
- Miles!

770
01:07:15,996 --> 01:07:16,829
Miles!

771
01:07:20,597 --> 01:07:21,808
(screams)

772
01:07:21,808 --> 01:07:24,475
(Miles giggles)

773
01:07:27,739 --> 01:07:30,045
(Flora giggles)

774
01:07:30,045 --> 01:07:32,712
(Miles giggles)

775
01:07:38,787 --> 01:07:40,537
- Aren't you going to say anything?

776
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:45,070
- What do you expect me to say?

777
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:46,820
- I thought you would like my joke.

778
01:07:48,121 --> 01:07:49,421
I suppose it wasn't funny.

779
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,400
- No, it wasn't.

780
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,550
Whatever possessed you?

781
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:58,070
- [Miles] I don't know
if you'd understand.

782
01:07:58,070 --> 01:07:59,823
- Believe me, Miles, I am trying.

783
01:08:03,081 --> 01:08:06,377
- I did it to show you I can
be bad, if you want me to.

784
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:08,910
- Why would I want you to be bad?

785
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:14,100
- I thought you were bored with me.

786
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:16,780
Maybe you wanted me to be more grown up.

787
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:19,650
You know, do something really wicked.

788
01:08:19,650 --> 01:08:21,360
It was only a game.

789
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:23,210
Even Flora thought it would be funny.

790
01:08:28,377 --> 01:08:30,627
I never meant to upset you.

791
01:08:35,968 --> 01:08:37,363
Are you still angry with me?

792
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,073
- No, Miles.

793
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,610
But there's something
you're not telling me.

794
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:44,700
Something that makes you do these things.

795
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:45,873
- But I did tell you.

796
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:49,337
- Not everything.

797
01:08:49,337 --> 01:08:51,973
And I'm becoming terribly concerned.

798
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:54,193
- You needn't be.

799
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:57,467
Now, may I say something?

800
01:09:01,407 --> 01:09:05,463
I like your hair down.
(sullen orchestral music)

801
01:09:05,463 --> 01:09:07,463
You're far too pretty to be a governess.

802
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:12,103
Sometimes I wonder what you're
thinking when you look at me.

803
01:09:18,013 --> 01:09:19,596
- Go to bed, Miles.

804
01:09:31,202 --> 01:09:33,081
Look at them.

805
01:09:33,081 --> 01:09:35,164
Look how sweet they look.

806
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:38,773
I wonder what they're
saying to one another.

807
01:09:38,773 --> 01:09:41,690
(muffled chatter)

808
01:09:41,690 --> 01:09:44,293
- Just children's prattle, miss.

809
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:47,013
- Children's prattle, indeed.

810
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:51,500
I know it's difficult for you
to think ill of these children

811
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:54,820
but if you'd seen what they
put me through last night,

812
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:55,653
it was cruel.

813
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,653
All their charm and
their natural goodness,

814
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:04,650
is just a sick game to deceive us.

815
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:07,220
- Deceive us about what, miss?

816
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:09,943
- About Fosc and Miss Jessel
and the games they play.

817
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:14,760
The more I learn about what
has happened to those children,

818
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,880
the less certain I feel that
I am right person for them.

819
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:22,563
- Then perhaps you
should inform the Master?

820
01:10:24,827 --> 01:10:26,590
- And what would I say to him?

821
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:29,393
That his house is infested
with evil spirits?

822
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,773
I don't know what to think anymore.

823
01:10:36,705 --> 01:10:38,203
Please, God.
(children laugh)

824
01:10:38,203 --> 01:10:41,263
Help me find a way to
protect these children.

825
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:49,793
It is obvious, children,

826
01:10:50,690 --> 01:10:52,763
that this deceit can go on no longer.

827
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,973
We all know that you're
aware of their presence.

828
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:03,853
So, I want you to both stop pretending.

829
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:08,510
Your secrets are safe with me.

830
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:11,013
You know that.

831
01:11:12,969 --> 01:11:13,940
(ominous music)

832
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:15,950
So, I want you to tell me what you do

833
01:11:17,249 --> 01:11:18,757
when you're alone with them.

834
01:11:21,013 --> 01:11:22,363
What do they say to you?

835
01:11:36,979 --> 01:11:38,920
(taps)

836
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,703
What do they say to you?

837
01:11:42,426 --> 01:11:44,758
What do they say to you?

838
01:11:44,758 --> 01:11:47,425
(distant moans)

839
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:55,750
(sullen orchestral music)
(distant moans)

840
01:12:05,428 --> 01:12:10,428
(Flora hums melodically)
(distant moans)

841
01:12:27,398 --> 01:12:32,398
(woman moans)
(Flora hums melodically)

842
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:06,903
What do you think you're doing?

843
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:09,907
- [Flora] We're playing
dressing up, would you like to--

844
01:13:09,907 --> 01:13:12,265
- Out of here, now, both of you!

845
01:13:12,265 --> 01:13:13,897
- Ow, you're hurting me!

846
01:13:13,897 --> 01:13:14,730
- Let go of her!

847
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:16,927
Why are you always spoiling everything?

848
01:13:16,927 --> 01:13:18,363
- We were only playing!

849
01:13:18,363 --> 01:13:19,950
- This is not play!

850
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:22,636
- You're just afraid,
afraid of being judged!

851
01:13:22,636 --> 01:13:27,053
(slap)
(Flora gasps)

852
01:13:31,937 --> 01:13:33,604
- [Governess] Flora.

853
01:13:39,565 --> 01:13:42,065
(birds tweet)

854
01:13:58,036 --> 01:14:01,869
Come along now, it's
time to go to confession.

855
01:14:03,423 --> 01:14:05,857
- I really don't see the point of it.

856
01:14:05,857 --> 01:14:08,156
- Because it'll do you good.

857
01:14:08,156 --> 01:14:12,516
- Why don't you go and
just let me stay here?

858
01:14:12,516 --> 01:14:13,349
- Miles.

859
01:14:14,287 --> 01:14:16,425
I'm sorry I struck you.

860
01:14:16,425 --> 01:14:18,697
- I'm quite tired of it all.

861
01:14:18,697 --> 01:14:21,697
Can't you see that we don't want you here?

862
01:14:21,697 --> 01:14:23,657
None of us do.

863
01:14:23,657 --> 01:14:25,177
- Who do you mean?

864
01:14:25,177 --> 01:14:27,514
- Who do you think I mean?

865
01:14:27,514 --> 01:14:29,250
I intend to write to my
uncle and let him know

866
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:31,133
what a miserable failure you've been.

867
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:34,963
- Miles, I'm only trying to help you.

868
01:14:35,830 --> 01:14:36,663
Listen to me.

869
01:14:36,663 --> 01:14:38,520
- I don't need your help!

870
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:40,410
Everything was fine, until you came.

871
01:14:42,097 --> 01:14:44,197
- [Remei] We're going to be late for mass!

872
01:14:45,194 --> 01:14:47,194
- You don't belong here.

873
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:52,193
Let's go.

874
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:57,194
She's not coming.

875
01:14:57,194 --> 01:15:00,694
(sullen orchestral music)

876
01:15:14,928 --> 01:15:17,608
(whispering)
(tense music)

877
01:15:17,608 --> 01:15:19,760
- [Whispering Voice] She
mustn't know, it's a secret.

878
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,593
(children giggle)

879
01:15:23,712 --> 01:15:26,192
She knows, she knows about them!

880
01:15:26,192 --> 01:15:31,192
She saw them. (giggles)

881
01:15:33,108 --> 01:15:36,541
(children giggle)
She know about them!

882
01:15:36,541 --> 01:15:41,541
She saw them. (giggles)

883
01:15:45,682 --> 01:15:47,932
(creaking)

884
01:15:52,536 --> 01:15:57,536
(suspenseful music)
(creaking)

885
01:16:04,106 --> 01:16:06,356
(creaking)

886
01:16:18,215 --> 01:16:20,465
(creaking)

887
01:16:25,339 --> 01:16:28,653
- Get out of here, you miserable wretch!

888
01:16:28,653 --> 01:16:30,162
Do you hear me?

889
01:16:30,162 --> 01:16:31,495
I said, get out!

890
01:16:32,461 --> 01:16:33,661
They're mine!

891
01:16:33,661 --> 01:16:35,078
They're all mine!

892
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:42,253
Mine to keep.

893
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:44,950
Mine to reckon with.

894
01:17:03,888 --> 01:17:07,388
(rudimentary piano music)

895
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:13,920
- What happened to you?

896
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,653
Why didn't you come with us?

897
01:17:16,930 --> 01:17:19,330
- She hanged herself in
this room, didn't she?

898
01:17:19,330 --> 01:17:20,653
And you didn't tell me.

899
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:24,220
- It was not necessary for you to know.

900
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,240
- You have allowed vile things to go on

901
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:33,210
in this house for far too long.

902
01:17:34,593 --> 01:17:38,330
And I realize now that I have
been charged with a service

903
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:40,763
that is both admirable and difficult.

904
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:45,130
I am convinced that the
children are possessed

905
01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:49,115
by some evil spirit.
(tense music)

906
01:17:49,115 --> 01:17:51,043
And it is our duty to protect them.

907
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:55,510
We must never, ever let
them out of our sight.

908
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:56,503
Do you understand?

909
01:17:57,405 --> 01:17:59,280
- I do not.

910
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,793
- Then you'll do as I say!

911
01:18:03,714 --> 01:18:06,631
(footsteps recede)

912
01:18:12,115 --> 01:18:15,615
(rudimentary piano music)

913
01:18:19,718 --> 01:18:22,177
(cacophonous piano chords)

914
01:18:22,177 --> 01:18:23,010
Miles!

915
01:18:24,857 --> 01:18:26,518
- You're so jumpy, my dear.

916
01:18:26,518 --> 01:18:27,720
Are you ill?

917
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:30,253
- I'm merely tired, I
haven't slept well lately.

918
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:33,990
- Yes, I know.
(bright piano music)

919
01:18:33,990 --> 01:18:34,823
- [Governess] Do you?

920
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:39,460
- Flora says you toss about
and make noises in your sleep.

921
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:41,810
But, of course, you can't
always believe Flora.

922
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:44,123
She invents things.

923
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:48,540
I don't like being angry with you.

924
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:51,913
I'd rather we be happy
together, you and I.

925
01:18:55,690 --> 01:18:58,193
- Then why did you say
such hurtful things to me?

926
01:19:01,009 --> 01:19:02,659
- Because you were smothering me.

927
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:06,197
(tense music)

928
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:12,200
(descending piano melody)

929
01:19:32,592 --> 01:19:35,925
(warm orchestral music)

930
01:19:40,493 --> 01:19:45,493
(Flora giggles)
(ominous tones)

931
01:19:52,689 --> 01:19:54,570
(Flora giggles)

932
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:56,470
- I told you not to let
her out of your sight!

933
01:19:56,470 --> 01:19:58,070
- One second, then she was gone.

934
01:19:58,070 --> 01:19:59,883
- I know where she went, now, come on.

935
01:20:02,599 --> 01:20:05,599
(suspenseful music)

936
01:20:13,998 --> 01:20:16,415
(wind blows)

937
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:29,099
See?

938
01:20:29,099 --> 01:20:30,599
See, there she is.

939
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:39,206
(Flora hums melodically)

940
01:20:41,709 --> 01:20:42,542
Flora?

941
01:20:44,126 --> 01:20:46,019
What are you doing here?

942
01:20:46,019 --> 01:20:46,852
- I told you.

943
01:20:46,852 --> 01:20:49,323
I come here to bury my secrets.

944
01:20:49,323 --> 01:20:51,033
- No more secrets, Flora.

945
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:53,686
Tell me where she is.

946
01:20:53,686 --> 01:20:54,519
- Who is?

947
01:20:55,739 --> 01:20:57,239
- Tell me, my pet.

948
01:20:58,846 --> 01:21:00,160
Where's Miss Jessel?

949
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,827
- Miss Jessel?
- Yes.

950
01:21:03,248 --> 01:21:05,915
(ominous tones)

951
01:21:08,229 --> 01:21:09,527
See!

952
01:21:09,527 --> 01:21:11,646
See, there she is!

953
01:21:11,646 --> 01:21:13,063
Out on the water!

954
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:15,313
- I see nothing.

955
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:20,028
- Open your eyes, for god's sake, woman!

956
01:21:20,028 --> 01:21:21,229
Don't you see her?

957
01:21:21,229 --> 01:21:22,062
Come on!

958
01:21:22,062 --> 01:21:24,348
- Let go of me, I do not!

959
01:21:24,348 --> 01:21:25,277
- There's nobody there.

960
01:21:25,277 --> 01:21:26,533
- How dare you say that,

961
01:21:26,533 --> 01:21:28,680
when she's right there in front of you!

962
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:29,948
Look at her!
(Flora screams)

963
01:21:29,948 --> 01:21:32,640
She knows you're there
and you're lying to me!

964
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:34,748
You little--
(Flora screams)

965
01:21:34,748 --> 01:21:36,789
- Get her away from me, she's evil!

966
01:21:36,789 --> 01:21:38,349
Cruel and evil!

967
01:21:38,349 --> 01:21:40,981
(screams)

968
01:21:40,981 --> 01:21:44,307
You filthy slut, I never
want to see you again!

969
01:21:44,307 --> 01:21:46,051
Go away, I hate you!

970
01:21:46,051 --> 01:21:47,640
I hate you!

971
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:49,807
(screams)

972
01:21:56,889 --> 01:21:59,556
(ominous tones)

973
01:22:12,978 --> 01:22:16,311
(faint heartbeat thuds)

974
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:22,481
(heartbeat thuds)

975
01:22:22,481 --> 01:22:24,648
(screams)

976
01:22:35,322 --> 01:22:37,489
(screams)

977
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:47,900
- My uncle should do something.

978
01:22:49,143 --> 01:22:50,693
Perhaps you could write to him.

979
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:54,650
- What makes you believe he'd do anything?

980
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:57,283
Has he ever helped before?

981
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,170
- You must stop worrying and try to rest.

982
01:23:05,023 --> 01:23:06,580
I'm here.

983
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:07,837
I'll take care of you.

984
01:23:09,383 --> 01:23:13,133
(Governess hums melodically)

985
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:39,833
- Is she any better?

986
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:41,890
- Worse.

987
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:43,063
She has taken a fever.

988
01:23:43,970 --> 01:23:46,220
- And is she still angry with me?

989
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:48,563
- She never wants to see you again.

990
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:52,600
Never have I heard such obscenities

991
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,720
from the mouth of a child.

992
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:56,750
And all about you.

993
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:57,970
- And do you still believe

994
01:23:57,970 --> 01:24:00,360
that there was no one there at the rocks?

995
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:04,920
- I saw no one myself,
just you, screaming at her!

996
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:07,970
You, pushing her toward the water.

997
01:24:07,970 --> 01:24:09,630
She was a happy child,

998
01:24:09,630 --> 01:24:13,550
until you forced her
into facing these things.

999
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:15,300
- Face what?

1000
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:16,133
Say it!

1001
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,313
- That bad memory.

1002
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:29,070
It was a heartless thing to do to a child,

1003
01:24:29,070 --> 01:24:31,253
just to satisfy yourself.

1004
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:33,923
If there is evil here,

1005
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:37,520
it is not Flora!

1006
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,280
- I am only trying to help her!

1007
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:43,340
Now, if you'll excuse me, I must see her.

1008
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:45,690
- [Remei] She is in no
condition to see you.

1009
01:24:45,690 --> 01:24:48,373
- She has to admit what
is happening to her!

1010
01:24:50,050 --> 01:24:52,597
- You must not see her.

1011
01:24:52,597 --> 01:24:54,783
- Mado Remei, may I remind you,

1012
01:24:54,783 --> 01:24:57,690
that the Master put me in sole charge?

1013
01:24:57,690 --> 01:24:59,033
I am the governess!

1014
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:01,890
Give me the keys!

1015
01:25:03,786 --> 01:25:06,286
(keys jangle)

1016
01:25:17,147 --> 01:25:19,141
(suspenseful music)

1017
01:25:19,141 --> 01:25:24,141
(door creaks)
(Flora moans and pants)

1018
01:25:36,487 --> 01:25:38,178
(Flora screams)

1019
01:25:38,178 --> 01:25:43,178
- [Flora] Get out of here! (screams)

1020
01:25:55,038 --> 01:25:56,838
(screams)

1021
01:25:56,838 --> 01:25:57,671
Help me!

1022
01:25:58,697 --> 01:26:00,864
(screams)

1023
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:13,188
- We'll take Flora to
the doctor, immediately.

1024
01:26:13,188 --> 01:26:14,743
- And what about Miles?

1025
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:18,053
- Miles will stay with me.

1026
01:26:18,993 --> 01:26:21,473
He came to me last night for my help,

1027
01:26:22,438 --> 01:26:24,800
and I intend to give it to him.

1028
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,243
- I will not leave him.

1029
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:30,873
- You will take Flora,
or you will be dismissed.

1030
01:26:31,885 --> 01:26:32,730
(Flora screams)

1031
01:26:32,730 --> 01:26:34,280
- The Master will hear of this.

1032
01:26:35,777 --> 01:26:38,444
(Flora screams)

1033
01:26:43,359 --> 01:26:46,692
(dark orchestral music)

1034
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:53,893
- Mado Remei?

1035
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,937
Tell Flora I'll be waiting for her.

1036
01:27:12,352 --> 01:27:15,973
(whip cracks)
(horse neighs)

1037
01:27:15,973 --> 01:27:19,473
(somber orchestral music)

1038
01:27:32,434 --> 01:27:34,934
(door creaks)

1039
01:27:43,545 --> 01:27:46,212
(fire crackles)

1040
01:27:48,413 --> 01:27:51,141
Our Father, who art in heaven.

1041
01:27:51,141 --> 01:27:54,413
Hallowed be thy name.

1042
01:27:54,413 --> 01:27:56,619
Thy kingdom come.

1043
01:27:56,619 --> 01:28:00,247
Thy will be done, on
earth, as it is in heaven.

1044
01:28:01,970 --> 01:28:03,733
Give us this day our daily bread,

1045
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:07,223
and forgive us our trespasses,

1046
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:11,023
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

1047
01:28:15,850 --> 01:28:17,800
Lead us, not into temptation,

1048
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:22,243
but deliver us from evil.

1049
01:28:51,784 --> 01:28:54,367
(clock chimes)

1050
01:29:05,445 --> 01:29:07,945
(clock ticks)

1051
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:12,263
(footsteps approach)

1052
01:29:14,928 --> 01:29:17,428
(door creaks)

1053
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,383
- I got your invitation.

1054
01:29:26,650 --> 01:29:28,490
You look lovely, my dear.

1055
01:29:28,490 --> 01:29:29,643
- Thank you, Miles.

1056
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:34,950
- Mado Remei and Flora left so suddenly.

1057
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:36,543
I couldn't even say goodbye.

1058
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:39,143
Is my sister very ill?

1059
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:43,280
- She would be, if she'd stayed.

1060
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:44,113
She'll be fine.

1061
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:47,850
- Now we have the whole
house to ourselves.

1062
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:51,893
I feel very grown up.

1063
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:54,383
- Yes.

1064
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,263
Now we can talk together like adults.

1065
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:10,423
What are you thinking, Miles?

1066
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:14,820
- I'm wondering what it will be like

1067
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:16,340
with just the two of us here.

1068
01:30:18,530 --> 01:30:19,980
- There are still the others.

1069
01:30:21,613 --> 01:30:22,833
- What do you mean?

1070
01:30:23,770 --> 01:30:25,870
- Is there something troubling you, Miles?

1071
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:28,293
- No.

1072
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:31,673
But I think there's
something troubling you.

1073
01:30:33,236 --> 01:30:35,164
You're always so tense.

1074
01:30:35,164 --> 01:30:38,247
(sullen piano music)

1075
01:30:43,964 --> 01:30:46,797
(chair screeches)

1076
01:30:50,404 --> 01:30:52,654
- I know what you suffered.

1077
01:30:56,323 --> 01:30:58,123
I know how it feels.

1078
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:01,683
How painful it is.

1079
01:31:04,122 --> 01:31:06,022
And whatever you may have done, Miles,

1080
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:10,000
I know it isn't your fault.

1081
01:31:16,934 --> 01:31:18,851
If you'd only trust me,

1082
01:31:19,770 --> 01:31:20,713
I could help you.

1083
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:36,040
And Miles...

1084
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:40,460
If you'd allow yourself to speak of them,

1085
01:31:43,094 --> 01:31:45,767
they won't be able to harm you anymore.

1086
01:31:48,305 --> 01:31:49,888
And they'd go away.

1087
01:31:51,054 --> 01:31:52,585
(chair screeches)

1088
01:31:52,585 --> 01:31:54,077
- Why are you always trying
to worm things out of me?

1089
01:31:54,077 --> 01:31:56,470
I haven't done anything!

1090
01:31:56,470 --> 01:31:58,020
- Then why were you expelled from school?

1091
01:31:58,020 --> 01:31:59,087
Tell me!

1092
01:31:59,087 --> 01:32:00,602
- 'Cause the boys didn't like me!

1093
01:32:00,602 --> 01:32:01,435
- Why?

1094
01:32:01,435 --> 01:32:02,268
What did you do to them?

1095
01:32:02,268 --> 01:32:04,920
- [Miles] I didn't do
anything, they were only games!

1096
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:06,334
- What games?

1097
01:32:06,334 --> 01:32:07,374
- I don't remember!

1098
01:32:07,374 --> 01:32:09,620
- You do remember, who told
you those horrible things?

1099
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:11,321
Who did it to you?

1100
01:32:11,321 --> 01:32:13,110
- I don't remember, I don't remember!

1101
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:14,073
- Must I tell you?

1102
01:32:14,073 --> 01:32:15,197
Must I tell you who it was

1103
01:32:15,197 --> 01:32:17,745
who did those horrible
things to you, Miles?

1104
01:32:17,745 --> 01:32:19,515
Shall I say his name?
- Stop it!

1105
01:32:19,515 --> 01:32:22,076
- Miles, say his name!
(Miles screams)

1106
01:32:22,076 --> 01:32:23,745
- You don't fool me!

1107
01:32:23,745 --> 01:32:27,305
I've seen how you look at me
and follow me everywhere I go!

1108
01:32:27,305 --> 01:32:29,684
Never letting me alone!

1109
01:32:29,684 --> 01:32:32,534
I know why you frightened
Flora half to death!

1110
01:32:32,534 --> 01:32:35,020
Because you're dead afraid of
ending up like the other one!

1111
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:38,540
You're just like her, a sick-minded bitch!

1112
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:40,290
A dirty whore!

1113
01:32:40,290 --> 01:32:43,090
(slap)
(Governess groans)

1114
01:32:43,090 --> 01:32:45,567
(slap)

1115
01:32:45,567 --> 01:32:47,734
(screams)

1116
01:32:50,281 --> 01:32:55,281
(screams)
(dramatic music)

1117
01:32:55,442 --> 01:32:56,275
- Miles!

1118
01:32:57,584 --> 01:32:59,375
(Miles screams)

1119
01:32:59,375 --> 01:33:00,208
Miles!

1120
01:33:04,325 --> 01:33:06,992
(Miles screams)

1121
01:33:09,544 --> 01:33:10,377
Miles!

1122
01:33:11,408 --> 01:33:13,158
Miles, it's not safe!

1123
01:33:15,678 --> 01:33:18,595
He's there, Miles, don't go to him.

1124
01:33:22,536 --> 01:33:24,285
- [Miles] Please don't hurt me.

1125
01:33:24,285 --> 01:33:26,576
Please don't hurt me.

1126
01:33:26,576 --> 01:33:28,659
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

1127
01:33:30,765 --> 01:33:31,598
Shh.

1128
01:33:33,165 --> 01:33:35,748
I love you, more than anything.

1129
01:33:38,085 --> 01:33:39,168
- Forgive me.

1130
01:33:40,085 --> 01:33:41,002
Forgive me.

1131
01:33:42,597 --> 01:33:43,917
- Oh, hush.

1132
01:33:43,917 --> 01:33:45,334
Hush, my darling.

1133
01:33:48,056 --> 01:33:49,723
It isn't your fault.

1134
01:33:50,596 --> 01:33:53,746
Those words, they weren't yours.

1135
01:33:53,746 --> 01:33:56,226
They were his.
(somber music)

1136
01:33:56,226 --> 01:33:57,476
- [Fosc] Miles.

1137
01:33:58,677 --> 01:34:01,594
(breathes heavily)

1138
01:34:02,628 --> 01:34:06,628
- He's here.
(Fosc growls)

1139
01:34:06,628 --> 01:34:09,035
I know you can see him.

1140
01:34:09,035 --> 01:34:10,710
I know you can.

1141
01:34:10,710 --> 01:34:14,393
If you just say his name,
he'll go away, Miles.

1142
01:34:16,208 --> 01:34:19,797
If you say it, say his name, Miles,

1143
01:34:19,797 --> 01:34:22,018
then he won't be able to harm you.

1144
01:34:22,018 --> 01:34:23,618
- He's dead.

1145
01:34:23,618 --> 01:34:27,008
He's dead!
(ominous tones)

1146
01:34:27,008 --> 01:34:28,877
- [Governess] No, Miles,
he's come to get you!

1147
01:34:28,877 --> 01:34:30,127
- [Fosc] Miles.

1148
01:34:31,496 --> 01:34:33,346
- [Governess] Say his name.

1149
01:34:33,346 --> 01:34:35,927
(Fosc growls)
Say his name!

1150
01:34:35,927 --> 01:34:37,037
- [Miles] He's dead!

1151
01:34:37,037 --> 01:34:38,306
- No, Miles!
- He's dead!

1152
01:34:38,306 --> 01:34:39,786
- He's come for you!
- He's dead!

1153
01:34:39,786 --> 01:34:41,506
- Say his name!
(Fosc growls)

1154
01:34:41,506 --> 01:34:44,136
- He's dead, he's dead!

1155
01:34:44,136 --> 01:34:45,197
(Fosc growls)

1156
01:34:45,197 --> 01:34:46,317
(screams)

1157
01:34:46,317 --> 01:34:47,150
- No!

1158
01:34:48,186 --> 01:34:50,296
Say his name!
(heartbeat thuds)

1159
01:34:50,296 --> 01:34:55,296
- Fosc.

1160
01:34:58,288 --> 01:34:59,288
- He's gone.

1161
01:35:01,141 --> 01:35:02,558
He's gone, Miles.

1162
01:35:04,381 --> 01:35:05,214
I'm here.

1163
01:35:07,141 --> 01:35:12,141
I'm here, my baby.
(somber orchestral music)

1164
01:35:13,162 --> 01:35:13,995
Miles?

1165
01:35:17,322 --> 01:35:18,155
Miles?

1166
01:35:25,050 --> 01:35:25,883
No!

1167
01:35:28,522 --> 01:35:29,355
Wake up!

1168
01:35:31,408 --> 01:35:33,491
(whines)

1169
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:41,790
Don't leave me.

1170
01:35:48,349 --> 01:35:50,432
I'll be with you forever.

1171
01:35:51,399 --> 01:35:52,899
We'll be together.

1172
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:54,653
Forever.

1173
01:36:12,325 --> 01:36:14,242
(sobs)

1174
01:36:43,928 --> 01:36:46,261
(owl hoots)

1175
01:36:48,095 --> 01:36:50,178
I'll be with you forever.

1176
01:36:51,569 --> 01:36:56,569
(music box chimes)
(suspenseful music)

1177
01:37:27,145 --> 01:37:29,249
- [Miles] Once upon a time,

1178
01:37:29,249 --> 01:37:32,300
there was a little girl
who suffered terribly.

1179
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:36,470
But finally, a young prince
came and carried her off,

1180
01:37:36,470 --> 01:37:39,337
to live in the land of the pink sky.

1181
01:37:39,337 --> 01:37:44,337
(heartbeat thuds)
(whispering)

1182
01:38:01,021 --> 01:38:04,438
(eerie orchestral music)

1183
01:38:37,781 --> 01:38:41,281
(somber orchestral music)

1184
01:42:44,090 --> 01:42:46,923
(Multicom Jingle)
