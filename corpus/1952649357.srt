1
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:28,719
This being your second divorce,
Mr. Henderson,

2
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:30,721
I'm sure you're familiar
with the procedure,

3
00:00:30,777 --> 00:00:33,223
but your wife--
ex-wife--should know

4
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,727
it would be wise not to
leave the state for a few weeks

5
00:00:36,783 --> 00:00:38,057
until it's finalized.

6
00:00:38,118 --> 00:00:40,064
I'm not planning
to leave the state.

7
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,724
No, she just left me.

8
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:43,734
She had nothing
against the land.

9
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,235
I'll tell you something.

10
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:47,738
If you two could have
made all your decisions

11
00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:50,240
with as much cooperation
as you made this one,

12
00:00:50,297 --> 00:00:53,744
I think you probably would
have had a happy marriage.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,245
Go figure.

14
00:00:55,302 --> 00:00:58,249
So, uh... that's basically it.

15
00:00:58,305 --> 00:01:01,377
I hate to bring up business,
but who do I bill?

16
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:02,545
Him.

17
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:04,054
What do you mean "him"?

18
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,386
I thought we were
going to split this.

19
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:08,392
You said you were paying
for the divorce.

20
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:10,394
I just said that
to get it started.

21
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,396
I thought we'd
wind up splitting it.

22
00:01:12,452 --> 00:01:15,899
You offered. You said you
were going to pay for it.

23
00:01:15,956 --> 00:01:18,232
See? This is why
it didn't work.

24
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:19,861
I don't know.

25
00:01:19,926 --> 00:01:24,397
We were always good on the surface,
though, weren't we, honey?

26
00:01:24,464 --> 00:01:26,068
Are we through?

27
00:01:26,132 --> 00:01:27,406
Yes.

28
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:29,413
Thank you.

29
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:30,971
I'll talk to you.

30
00:01:35,842 --> 00:01:39,289
She came with a lot
of nice furniture.

31
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:53,416
Hello?

32
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:56,317
I need a designated driver.

33
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,362
I don't know what
I really feel.

34
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:08,365
I guess I'm not going to
feel it for days.

35
00:05:10,423 --> 00:05:12,869
Maybe I shouldn't
even say anything.

36
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:15,873
I mean, you probably
don't want to hear this,

37
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:18,432
but I thought she was nice.

38
00:05:18,498 --> 00:05:20,535
10 years ago,
that would have killed me,

39
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,874
but you're right.

40
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:23,209
She was nice.

41
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:24,873
She was a very nice woman.

42
00:05:24,938 --> 00:05:26,884
Who'll make some
nice man very happy,

43
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,385
but I'm not that man.

44
00:05:29,943 --> 00:05:31,388
Maybe you shouldn't
get married anymore.

45
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:32,718
I want kids.

46
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:33,883
Well, adopt.

47
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:36,723
I want to pass down my seed.

48
00:05:36,783 --> 00:05:38,387
Masturbate in the garden.

49
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,227
Thanks for coming
and talking to me.

50
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:43,892
Why don't you go
clown with him?

51
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:45,561
I'm listening.
Come on, I'm listening.

52
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,401
Can I have another
double here, please?

53
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:52,739
Listen, the thing is, you got
to know what you're looking for,

54
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:55,245
and you don't have a clue.

55
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:57,338
I guess I don't, do I?

56
00:05:57,403 --> 00:05:58,848
I mean...

57
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:00,851
Whoa, hey, cowboy.
That's plenty.

58
00:06:00,907 --> 00:06:04,855
Do you think that all the girls
you've ever gone out with,

59
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:06,356
including your wives,

60
00:06:06,412 --> 00:06:08,858
do you think they're
all the same woman?

61
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,857
Well, the 2 wives were the same,
that's for sure.

62
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,365
I'd say out of

63
00:06:15,421 --> 00:06:17,867
the 5 serious
relationships I've had,

64
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:19,870
3 were exactly the same,

65
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:22,873
One was different,
unlike anybody else,

66
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:24,931
One might have been a man.

67
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:28,878
Really?

68
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:30,346
Really?

69
00:06:30,403 --> 00:06:32,383
If you were a woman
and you said that,

70
00:06:32,438 --> 00:06:33,883
I'd never want to
talk to you again,

71
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,544
but I'm still going
to be your friend.

72
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:36,882
Why is that?

73
00:06:36,943 --> 00:06:38,388
Did you see that movie?

74
00:06:38,444 --> 00:06:39,548
What movie?

75
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:41,057
You know,
the one where a guy lives

76
00:06:41,114 --> 00:06:44,061
with a Chinese woman for 20 years,
and it turns out to be a man?

77
00:06:44,117 --> 00:06:45,061
M Butterfly.

78
00:06:45,118 --> 00:06:46,062
Yes.

79
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:47,894
Think something
like that's possible?

80
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:49,900
How can it be possible?

81
00:06:49,956 --> 00:06:52,402
I mean, let's say she
fools the husband.

82
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,904
Doesn't she have to go
for an insurance physical?

83
00:06:54,961 --> 00:06:56,838
Then doesn't the doctor
call the spouse?

84
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:58,341
"Hey, how's my wife doing?"

85
00:06:58,398 --> 00:06:59,843
"She's in very good health,

86
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:01,344
especially her balls."

87
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:07,350
OK, well, if all
the women are the same,

88
00:07:07,407 --> 00:07:09,853
what kind of woman is that?

89
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:11,855
Once you figure that out,

90
00:07:11,911 --> 00:07:14,482
you go for the opposite.

91
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:18,359
Let's see, the one thing
they all had in common...

92
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:20,364
They didn't really
believe in me.

93
00:07:21,754 --> 00:07:22,698
Really?

94
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:23,699
Yeah.

95
00:07:23,756 --> 00:07:25,167
Well, Jesus, that's weird.

96
00:07:25,225 --> 00:07:27,865
You like women who
don't believe in you?

97
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:29,531
Yeah, I guess I do.

98
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:30,870
God.

99
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,376
Woman doesn't support me,
I'm out of there.

100
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,881
Why do you think that is?

101
00:07:37,937 --> 00:07:40,383
Do you like men
who don't believe in you?

102
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,384
No.

103
00:07:41,441 --> 00:07:43,387
So what in God's name
would you like

104
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:45,389
a woman who doesn't
believe in you for?

105
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:46,753
I don't get it.

106
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:51,895
Are either of you
fellows married?

107
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:54,397
One of my sons
just got a divorce.

108
00:07:54,454 --> 00:07:57,060
They just can't seem
to stay married anymore.

109
00:07:57,123 --> 00:07:59,194
Heh heh heh.

110
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:03,901
All right, ma'am.

111
00:08:03,963 --> 00:08:05,965
All hooked up and ready to go.

112
00:08:06,032 --> 00:08:09,844
Well, gee, does that look
a little green to you?

113
00:08:09,903 --> 00:08:11,849
I don't think so.

114
00:08:11,905 --> 00:08:14,852
Gee, it looks
a little green to me.

115
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:16,512
No, ma'am. That's normal.

116
00:08:16,576 --> 00:08:17,748
Does that look green to you?

117
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:18,754
Yes, thank you.

118
00:08:27,587 --> 00:08:28,861
What's wrong with him?

119
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:31,402
He's mentally ill, ma'am.

120
00:08:31,457 --> 00:08:33,368
Ohh...

121
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:34,962
Oh, look, see.

122
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:36,701
There's something wrong with this.

123
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:38,208
There is nothing wrong, ma'am.

124
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:39,868
My friend did not
understand you.

125
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:41,537
But it doesn't look right.

126
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:43,376
Turn it to another channel.

127
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:45,882
Oh, my God,
that's too green.

128
00:08:45,939 --> 00:08:47,384
That's the grass, ma'am.

129
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,386
That's supposed to be green.

130
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:50,887
Ooh, I think there's
something wrong.

131
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:52,890
I'm not going to sign for this.

132
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:55,051
In the store,
the picture was perfect,

133
00:08:55,114 --> 00:08:56,491
The picture is fine, ma'am.

134
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:58,722
I tell you what.
You watch it.

135
00:08:58,785 --> 00:09:00,321
The House of Discounts
guarantees it.

136
00:09:00,386 --> 00:09:03,333
If you don't like it in a couple weeks,
I come and take it back.

137
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:05,835
Well, maybe I shouldn't
sign anything until then.

138
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:09,339
Ma'am, please, I cannot leave
this here unless you sign this.

139
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:10,840
This picture is perfect.

140
00:09:10,897 --> 00:09:12,843
In the beginning,
when you turn it on,

141
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,845
green is the color
that comes up the most,

142
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:17,279
but then, in a few minutes,
it goes away.

143
00:09:17,337 --> 00:09:20,341
But the television in the store
looked perfect.

144
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:22,352
That's because
the televisions in the stores

145
00:09:22,408 --> 00:09:25,355
are turned on a long time
before you get there.

146
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:26,856
I don't think so.

147
00:09:26,913 --> 00:09:28,859
I was there at 9:15,
right when they opened.

148
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:30,861
I know, ma'am,
but the televisions

149
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:33,864
are turned on in the middle
of the night automatically,

150
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,867
so the color is perfect
by the time people like you

151
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:38,402
get there at 9:15.

152
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,402
Really?

153
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:40,437
Yes.

154
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:41,870
Are you sure of that?

155
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:43,373
I am positive.

156
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:44,874
Hmm. All right.

157
00:09:44,931 --> 00:09:47,207
I'll watch for a few days,

158
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:49,143
and I'll let you know.

159
00:09:49,202 --> 00:09:53,275
Oh, boy. I'll be waiting
for that call, ma'am.

160
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:54,875
Thank you.

161
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:58,218
Don't bother seeing me out.
I will find the door.

162
00:09:58,277 --> 00:09:59,620
Hmm.

163
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,897
Oh, um. Make sure you
shut the door, please.

164
00:10:10,957 --> 00:10:12,061
Hello.

165
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,069
Mother?

166
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:14,298
Hello, Jeff.

167
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,306
Good guess.
Try the other one.

168
00:10:16,362 --> 00:10:17,898
Oh, hello, dear.

169
00:10:17,964 --> 00:10:21,002
I was just talking about you.

170
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:22,068
To who?

171
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:23,409
To these installers.

172
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:24,573
Installers?

173
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:26,913
Yes. We were just
talking about you.

174
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:28,418
What, about my book?

175
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:31,751
No, no, no, dear. I told them
you'd just gotten a divorce.

176
00:10:31,811 --> 00:10:32,915
You what?

177
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:35,084
I told them you got a divorce.

178
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:36,388
They know me?

179
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:38,759
Of course not.

180
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:41,765
Well, why did you
tell them that?

181
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:43,596
I don't know.
We were talking about marriage,

182
00:10:43,656 --> 00:10:45,431
and I asked them
if they were married,

183
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:46,936
and I mentioned you weren't.

184
00:10:46,993 --> 00:10:49,439
Great. Why don't you give me
their home number, Mom,

185
00:10:49,495 --> 00:10:51,441
and I'll call them later
and fill them in?

186
00:10:51,497 --> 00:10:53,534
So, how are you?
Are you OK?

187
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:55,408
Oh, fine. And you?

188
00:10:55,468 --> 00:10:58,415
I'm all right. I just called
to say hello. That's all.

189
00:10:58,471 --> 00:10:59,882
Is everything out of the house?

190
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:01,384
Everything that was hers, yeah.

191
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:03,387
Honey, you should go
and get new furniture tomorrow.

192
00:11:03,443 --> 00:11:05,889
I have stuff to do
before I get new furniture.

193
00:11:05,945 --> 00:11:07,390
Don't worry.

194
00:11:07,447 --> 00:11:10,394
I don't want you to sit in a big,
empty house. It's bad for you.

195
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,895
I'll take care of it.

196
00:11:11,951 --> 00:11:14,397
And also, buy yourself
some new clothes.

197
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:15,558
Why?

198
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:17,567
Well, because
the last time I saw you,

199
00:11:17,623 --> 00:11:19,398
I just thought
you could look better.

200
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:20,904
Look better than what?

201
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,405
Well, just look better.

202
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:23,907
You want to meet somebody.

203
00:11:23,963 --> 00:11:26,910
Well, I don't want to
trick anybody into liking me.

204
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:28,411
What do you mean?

205
00:11:28,468 --> 00:11:30,914
Why do you always think it
has to do with these things?

206
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,416
Don't you think I could meet somebody
wearing crappy shoes,

207
00:11:33,473 --> 00:11:34,645
and they'd still like me?

208
00:11:34,707 --> 00:11:36,414
Honey, wear whatever you want.

209
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:38,422
I just think if you
were wearing crappy shoes,

210
00:11:38,478 --> 00:11:40,424
they'd say, "Why are you
wearing crappy shoes?"

211
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,585
That's what I think,
but you do what you want.

212
00:11:42,648 --> 00:11:44,889
Maybe there's somebody out there
who wouldn't say that.

213
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:46,430
Whatever, dear.
You look for them.

214
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:49,433
Ooh. I have a call waiting.

215
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:50,934
Hello?

216
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,435
It's still me, Mother.

217
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:55,100
Hello.

218
00:11:55,161 --> 00:11:57,038
Still me, Mother.

219
00:11:58,264 --> 00:11:59,368
Hi?

220
00:11:59,432 --> 00:12:01,878
Why do you even
pay for this feature?

221
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:04,877
Well, they hung up anyway.

222
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:07,884
So...

223
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,578
How's the book?

224
00:12:09,642 --> 00:12:11,383
Well, a lot of people

225
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:13,390
think I should write a sequel.

226
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:14,550
To what?

227
00:12:16,282 --> 00:12:17,625
The last book.

228
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:20,027
The space thing?

229
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:21,224
Yeah.

230
00:12:29,795 --> 00:12:30,933
Hello?

231
00:12:30,997 --> 00:12:32,806
Oh, yes, honey, I'm still here.

232
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:34,401
You don't think so, huh?

233
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:37,414
Well, honey, I'm not smart
like the people you know,

234
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,915
but that's what they advise you?

235
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:40,917
I mean, that's what they say?

236
00:12:40,973 --> 00:12:42,782
Yes, many of them do.

237
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:45,914
Well, they know
a lot more than me.

238
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:47,548
I don't know.

239
00:12:47,613 --> 00:12:49,092
But you didn't like the book,
right?

240
00:12:49,148 --> 00:12:50,923
You don't think it
deserves a sequel?

241
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:51,984
Oh, no, honey,

242
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:53,928
I love the book,
but are you sure

243
00:12:53,986 --> 00:12:56,398
you want to bring back
all those characters?

244
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:02,873
I'll talk to you later.

245
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:04,875
Honey, I love you.

246
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:07,377
I know you think you do.

247
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:11,380
Oh, I have another call
coming through.

248
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:12,541
Hello?

249
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:15,449
This happens all day,
doesn't it?

250
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:20,723
He wrote this?

251
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,724
Yeah.

252
00:13:21,781 --> 00:13:23,055
How did you meet him?

253
00:13:23,115 --> 00:13:24,059
In the market.

254
00:13:24,116 --> 00:13:25,561
And he had his book with him?

255
00:13:25,618 --> 00:13:27,894
He had it in the trunk.

256
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:29,399
Did you read it?

257
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:31,628
No, but it's a real book.

258
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:33,068
Is he rich?

259
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,901
I don't know.
He just got a divorce.

260
00:13:35,962 --> 00:13:37,407
When?

261
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:38,908
2 weeks ago.

262
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:41,411
Gee, that's a little soon
to go out with somebody.

263
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:43,913
I'm just having dinner with him,
not having sex.

264
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,415
Does he know that?

265
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:47,417
Well, he will by dessert.

266
00:13:55,915 --> 00:13:57,360
Who is it?

267
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,861
John Henderson.

268
00:13:58,918 --> 00:14:00,363
Come on in.

269
00:14:01,787 --> 00:14:03,357
How do I look?

270
00:14:03,422 --> 00:14:04,696
Gorgeous.

271
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:06,361
Thanks.

272
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:12,875
Hi, John.

273
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:15,378
Hi. Wow, you look great.

274
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:17,072
OK.

275
00:14:17,136 --> 00:14:19,377
Um, this is my roommate Donna.

276
00:14:19,438 --> 00:14:20,382
Hi.

277
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:21,509
Hi.

278
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:25,386
So, you all ready?

279
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:27,890
Well, I'd have to
be all ready.

280
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:29,517
I came here to get you.

281
00:14:29,582 --> 00:14:32,222
What do you mean?

282
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:36,228
Nothing.

283
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:37,893
Oh. Go?

284
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:39,231
Sure.

285
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:41,900
See you later.

286
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:43,406
Bye.

287
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:50,413
How's the salad? Good?

288
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:51,914
Good. Yours?

289
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:53,416
Good.

290
00:14:53,472 --> 00:14:54,746
Oh.

291
00:14:56,742 --> 00:14:59,848
Have you always wanted
to be a writer?

292
00:14:59,912 --> 00:15:01,858
Yes, I think I have.

293
00:15:01,914 --> 00:15:04,861
Who are some of
your favorite authors?

294
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:08,365
Well, I like you.

295
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:10,367
You've read my books?

296
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:12,869
No, I mean, as a person.

297
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:14,370
Oh.

298
00:15:14,427 --> 00:15:16,873
Did you, uh... read my book?

299
00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:20,376
No, I couldn't.
I had a really busy week.

300
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:24,380
Did you read the flap?

301
00:15:24,437 --> 00:15:26,383
Um...no, actually,
I didn't.

302
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:28,885
Why, what was on the flap?

303
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:33,390
Well, you know, they summarize
the book and tell about me.

304
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:37,894
Did you look
at anything at all?

305
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,396
Um, I saw your picture
on the back.

306
00:15:40,453 --> 00:15:42,399
I thought it was cute.

307
00:15:42,455 --> 00:15:44,401
You read the picture, then.

308
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,403
So, then, besides me,

309
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,407
who are some of your
other favorite authors?

310
00:15:50,463 --> 00:15:51,908
Um...

311
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:55,343
Gee, I didn't know
I'd be taking a test.

312
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:57,347
Oh, it's not a test.

313
00:15:57,403 --> 00:15:59,679
I'm just making conversation.

314
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,345
Um, let me... let me see.

315
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:10,360
Oh, who wrote that book
about Hollywood?

316
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,861
Hollywood?

317
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:14,864
Like a coffee-table book?

318
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,024
No.

319
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:18,868
What book?

320
00:16:18,924 --> 00:16:20,369
You know, the...

321
00:16:20,426 --> 00:16:22,531
The one where they
took all those pills.

322
00:16:24,096 --> 00:16:25,370
Julia Philips.

323
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:27,877
No, no.
I know it's not that one.

324
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:29,378
No.

325
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:30,880
Um...let's see...

326
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:33,883
Jacqueline.

327
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:35,384
Um... Jacqueline...

328
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:36,886
Jacqueline Susann?

329
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:38,387
Yes. I love her.

330
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:39,889
You don't mean...

331
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:41,390
Yes.
Valley of the Dolls.

332
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:42,892
That's it. That was it.

333
00:16:42,948 --> 00:16:44,393
That's what you meant.

334
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,397
You know, that book was written,
like, 30 years ago.

335
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:51,902
So? What, you can't like somebody
who wrote a book a long time ago?

336
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:53,402
No, you're right.

337
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:55,234
Don't people like Charlie Chaplin?

338
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:58,298
You know, when did he write?

339
00:16:58,364 --> 00:17:02,471
Charlie Chaplin wasn't a writer.
He was a comedian.

340
00:17:02,535 --> 00:17:05,516
No, he wasn't.
He was a writer.

341
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:08,609
Tale of Two Cities,
um...

342
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,356
Hey, I have an idea.

343
00:17:13,412 --> 00:17:15,085
Let's get the check.

344
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:26,033
Help me!

345
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:35,276
Mmm, I'm thinking about branching out
and handling entertainers.

346
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:39,545
I wonder if that's
such a good idea.

347
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:41,551
Can't a sports agent
handle entertainers?

348
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:43,883
I mean, Mike Ovitz
used to handle athletes,

349
00:17:43,943 --> 00:17:45,388
so why not?

350
00:17:45,444 --> 00:17:47,754
Well, I guess you're right.

351
00:17:47,813 --> 00:17:49,759
Have you finished
your new book?

352
00:17:49,815 --> 00:17:52,386
Actually, I haven't
even started it.

353
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:55,193
I've, uh... got a block.

354
00:17:55,254 --> 00:17:56,494
What's a block?

355
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:58,592
Uh, it's when he can't write.

356
00:17:58,657 --> 00:18:00,830
Oh, don't tell her that.

357
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:02,065
I can write, honey.

358
00:18:02,127 --> 00:18:04,471
I just don't know what I'm
going to write about.

359
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,474
Uncle John?

360
00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:06,475
Yeah?

361
00:18:06,532 --> 00:18:08,443
Why don't you write
about a monster?

362
00:18:08,501 --> 00:18:10,174
Hey, he already did that, buddy.

363
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:12,182
I can't do it again?

364
00:18:12,238 --> 00:18:15,185
Doesn't Stephen King
write about the same thing

365
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:16,845
over and over and over?

366
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:18,354
But that's Stephen King.

367
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,855
What does that mean?

368
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:22,688
She just means, you know...

369
00:18:22,748 --> 00:18:25,820
I mean, he's a big seller.

370
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:28,195
I see. So that gives him
the right to repeat.

371
00:18:28,254 --> 00:18:29,665
I don't have that right.

372
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:32,032
Misery was cool.

373
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:33,536
Let's forget it.

374
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:36,539
Besides, you shouldn't
compare yourself to anyone,

375
00:18:36,595 --> 00:18:38,074
let alone Stephen King.

376
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,541
Thanks.

377
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,204
Want to see my latest?

378
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:44,373
Hmm.

379
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:46,875
Wow.

380
00:18:46,939 --> 00:18:48,043
Yeah, huh?

381
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:49,552
What is this?

382
00:18:49,608 --> 00:18:51,884
This is an autographed picture
of Babe Ruth.

383
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:53,389
It is, isn't it?

384
00:18:53,445 --> 00:18:54,549
Yeah.

385
00:18:54,613 --> 00:18:56,092
Jesus. Autographed to you?

386
00:18:56,148 --> 00:18:58,150
Of course not.
I wasn't even born then.

387
00:18:58,217 --> 00:19:00,458
No, I know when you were born.
just joking.

388
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:03,329
"To Harry, good luck.
The Babe."

389
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:05,335
Well, you know what
you have to do.

390
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:07,337
You have to have another kid
and name him Harry.

391
00:19:07,393 --> 00:19:08,997
Then this really becomes valuable.

392
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:10,506
Look at this.

393
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,831
Hmm.

394
00:19:12,898 --> 00:19:14,844
Know how much that's worth?

395
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,345
It's the original?

396
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:17,847
Yes, the original. Guess.

397
00:19:17,903 --> 00:19:20,349
I don't know. 2 grand?

398
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:22,352
$50,000.

399
00:19:22,408 --> 00:19:24,854
Who is going to give you
$50,000 for this?

400
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,355
The market is 11-year-olds.

401
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:28,016
You'd be lucky to get 10 bucks

402
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,525
for anything, wouldn't you?

403
00:19:29,582 --> 00:19:31,858
No. You've no idea
about this stuff.

404
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:33,362
I guess I don't.

405
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,160
Have a seat.

406
00:19:39,425 --> 00:19:40,870
So, what's wrong?

407
00:19:40,926 --> 00:19:43,372
Why does something
have to be wrong?

408
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:49,311
Well, hey, you're here.
Something's wrong.

409
00:19:49,368 --> 00:19:51,871
You don't come here
if something isn't wrong.

410
00:19:51,937 --> 00:19:53,610
All right.
Something's wrong.

411
00:19:53,672 --> 00:19:54,878
What's the problem?

412
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,851
How often do you talk to Mother?

413
00:19:56,909 --> 00:19:57,853
Every day.

414
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,856
Really? Every day?

415
00:19:59,912 --> 00:20:02,085
Yeah.
Hey, look what I sent her.

416
00:20:02,147 --> 00:20:03,649
What is that?

417
00:20:03,716 --> 00:20:05,491
That's a picture phone.

418
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:07,827
She's not going to
be able to work that.

419
00:20:07,886 --> 00:20:09,263
Why not?

420
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:11,392
No person over 60
can operate anything like this.

421
00:20:11,457 --> 00:20:13,903
Have you ever seen what she does
with call waiting?

422
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:15,905
This is simple.
You look in the camera.

423
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:17,406
She'll never take the lens cap off.

424
00:20:17,463 --> 00:20:18,908
You want one?

425
00:20:18,964 --> 00:20:20,409
See, I thought maybe
the whole family

426
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:22,412
could look at each other
when we talk.

427
00:20:22,468 --> 00:20:24,914
Well, I'm moving
out of my place,

428
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,179
so I don't really
know where I'd put it.

429
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,117
You're moving out
of your place?

430
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:32,553
Yes. I'm trying
to tell you something.

431
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:35,114
You just take the picture phone
and keep it in the box.

432
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,592
Don't unwrap it.
Then wherever you go, you plug it in.

433
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,924
OK, good.

434
00:20:40,486 --> 00:20:43,023
Do you feel
that Mother likes you?

435
00:20:43,088 --> 00:20:44,931
Yeah.
Of course she likes me.

436
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,435
She loves me.

437
00:20:46,492 --> 00:20:50,440
But are you having the life
that she thinks you should have?

438
00:20:50,496 --> 00:20:52,442
In other words,
did she ever think

439
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:54,102
that you shouldn't
become an agent

440
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,702
because you're
not a great one?

441
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:57,372
I'm not a great one?

442
00:20:57,436 --> 00:20:59,882
I was making $100,000
out of the gate.

443
00:20:59,938 --> 00:21:02,384
We were all blown away,
including her.

444
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:04,387
So if I sold 5 million books,

445
00:21:04,443 --> 00:21:05,888
you think she'd like me more?

446
00:21:05,944 --> 00:21:07,389
She likes you.

447
00:21:07,446 --> 00:21:10,393
But, still, do you think
she'd be proud of me?

448
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:13,896
Do you think she'd bond with me
the way she does with you?

449
00:21:16,955 --> 00:21:19,128
You're a complicated guy.

450
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:21,899
Oh, so that's it, then.

451
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,405
You're a simpleton?

452
00:21:23,462 --> 00:21:26,409
I'm in more of
a black-and-white business.

453
00:21:26,465 --> 00:21:28,411
everyone sees.

454
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:30,242
Your years are not
that visible.

455
00:21:31,804 --> 00:21:34,250
But you don't seek
her approval, huh?

456
00:21:34,306 --> 00:21:36,616
I mean, obviously,
she doesn't criticize you.

457
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:37,915
Everything is perfect.

458
00:21:37,976 --> 00:21:39,421
Of course not.

459
00:21:39,478 --> 00:21:41,424
She criticizes the way
I raise the kids.

460
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,925
I mean, she has opinions.

461
00:21:42,981 --> 00:21:44,551
It doesn't get to me.

462
00:21:44,616 --> 00:21:46,926
Why does it get to me?

463
00:21:46,985 --> 00:21:48,430
I don't know.

464
00:21:48,487 --> 00:21:49,932
I mean, we're different.

465
00:21:49,988 --> 00:21:53,094
Maybe the relationship with Dad
had something to do with this.

466
00:21:53,158 --> 00:21:56,139
Maybe Dad was different with me
than he was with you.

467
00:21:57,763 --> 00:21:59,436
Maybe he was.

468
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:01,205
Well, let me tell you something.

469
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:03,041
This is affecting my whole life.

470
00:22:03,102 --> 00:22:07,380
I feel estranged from my own mother,
and I don't like it.

471
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:10,249
It affects everything I do,
especially with women.

472
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:12,380
But you ought to
just forget about it.

473
00:22:12,444 --> 00:22:13,889
You're grown up.

474
00:22:13,946 --> 00:22:15,584
I mean,
there's nothing you can do.

475
00:22:15,647 --> 00:22:17,388
Ah. I don't think
that's true.

476
00:22:17,449 --> 00:22:19,429
I've been thinking
about this a lot.

477
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:25,901
I'm going to move
back in with Mother.

478
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,996
No, you're not.

479
00:22:30,062 --> 00:22:31,973
Yeah, I am.

480
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,408
That's the worst thing
I've ever heard.

481
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:35,740
That's stupid.

482
00:22:37,302 --> 00:22:39,407
You're grown up.
What are you going to do?

483
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:41,246
Why are you going to do that?

484
00:22:41,306 --> 00:22:43,149
You know what?
You sound a little jealous.

485
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,448
Yeah, right.

486
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,582
I'm jealous. That's what I want
is my old room back.

487
00:22:47,646 --> 00:22:48,920
Come on.

488
00:22:48,981 --> 00:22:51,359
Oh, man. Go see a doctor.

489
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:53,919
No, I don't need
to see a doctor.

490
00:22:53,986 --> 00:22:55,863
I wasn't raised by a doctor.

491
00:22:55,921 --> 00:22:57,867
I was raised by my mother.

492
00:22:57,923 --> 00:23:00,199
That's who I need to see.

493
00:24:16,568 --> 00:24:17,672
Where you heading?

494
00:24:17,736 --> 00:24:19,716
Heading up north.

495
00:24:19,771 --> 00:24:20,806
Big Sur?

496
00:24:20,873 --> 00:24:22,819
No. Big Mama.

497
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,082
Ha ha ha!

498
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:30,059
What the hell does that mean?

499
00:25:21,867 --> 00:25:23,540
Hi!

500
00:25:23,602 --> 00:25:26,378
Honey,
I'm on the picture phone.

501
00:25:26,438 --> 00:25:27,917
Just a minute.

502
00:25:30,943 --> 00:25:33,549
Drove 400 miles,
she won't come out.

503
00:25:36,648 --> 00:25:39,629
More to the left, Mom.
I can't see you.

504
00:25:39,685 --> 00:25:40,993
I can see you.

505
00:25:41,053 --> 00:25:44,660
That doesn't mean I can see you.
You had it right before.

506
00:25:44,723 --> 00:25:47,897
Honey, why don't they put
the camera right where you are,

507
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,237
and that way, I won't have
to move all over the place.

508
00:25:51,296 --> 00:25:53,173
Just move to the left!

509
00:25:53,231 --> 00:25:56,701
Honey, John is here.
I'll call you back.

510
00:25:56,768 --> 00:25:58,839
We didn't even get
a chance to talk.

511
00:25:58,904 --> 00:26:00,383
Move up so I can see you.

512
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:03,010
Let me call you back.
John's here now.

513
00:26:03,075 --> 00:26:04,918
Call me back soon.

514
00:26:04,977 --> 00:26:07,924
Oh, do you want to
say hi to John?

515
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,426
Do you want to try to see him?

516
00:26:10,482 --> 00:26:12,018
That's all right, Mother.

517
00:26:12,084 --> 00:26:14,360
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

518
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:15,955
Ooh. All right, dear.

519
00:26:16,021 --> 00:26:18,365
You'll explain how to work it
next time.

520
00:26:21,093 --> 00:26:23,869
Oh, honey,
how do I tum this thing off?

521
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:27,877
I told him I like this,
but it's driving me crazy.

522
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:29,412
Oh, honey, you look tired.

523
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,381
I just drove 400 miles.

524
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:35,384
Can't you start with a hello

525
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,420
and then move into a criticism?

526
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:41,219
Oh, you know
I'm happy to see you.

527
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,453
Now, why didn't you
want to stay in a hotel?

528
00:26:44,516 --> 00:26:46,462
I told you what's going on.

529
00:26:46,518 --> 00:26:48,725
You know, dear,
I really don't understand

530
00:26:48,787 --> 00:26:50,733
what you mean by
"the experiment"

531
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:53,668
but listen--the couch
will do for a few nights.

532
00:26:53,725 --> 00:26:55,500
I don't want to stay
on the couch.

533
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,506
I want to be here longer
than a few nights.

534
00:26:57,562 --> 00:26:59,838
I thought I could get
my old room back.

535
00:26:59,898 --> 00:27:02,003
No, dear.
That's a sewing room now.

536
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:03,011
You sew?

537
00:27:03,068 --> 00:27:05,844
No, but I have things in there,

538
00:27:05,904 --> 00:27:08,942
and I don't want to
start going through them.

539
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:11,180
But, Mother,
I want my room back.

540
00:27:11,243 --> 00:27:12,187
Why?

541
00:27:12,244 --> 00:27:14,190
Because it's part
of the experiment.

542
00:27:14,246 --> 00:27:17,352
I want to see what feelings
it would bring up to be in there.

543
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:19,020
Listen, I'll clear
everything out.

544
00:27:19,084 --> 00:27:20,688
When I leave,
I'll put it all back.

545
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:22,129
What's the big deal?

546
00:27:22,187 --> 00:27:24,360
You don't want to clear
anything out of that room.

547
00:27:24,423 --> 00:27:26,869
Sleep on it tonight,
and we'll talk about it tomorrow.

548
00:27:26,925 --> 00:27:28,871
All right,
but I know what I want.

549
00:27:28,927 --> 00:27:30,201
Want something to eat?

550
00:27:30,262 --> 00:27:31,366
Um...no.

551
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,876
I made some salad,
and I have some meat loaf.

552
00:27:33,932 --> 00:27:35,206
I don't eat meat.

553
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:37,372
Oh, that's right.
That's Jeff who loves it.

554
00:27:37,436 --> 00:27:38,710
I'll have some salad.

555
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,215
Don't have salad
just for my sake.

556
00:27:40,272 --> 00:27:41,546
No, no. I'll have it.

557
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:42,880
Are you sure you want salad?

558
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:44,215
Yes, I want salad.

559
00:27:44,276 --> 00:27:45,550
Not just for my sake?

560
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,556
Don't get into
this food stuff now, please.

561
00:27:47,612 --> 00:27:48,886
Just give me a little salad.

562
00:27:48,947 --> 00:27:50,221
I know what I could do.

563
00:27:50,282 --> 00:27:52,228
I could scrape the top
off the meat loaf.

564
00:27:52,284 --> 00:27:53,558
What would that do?

565
00:27:53,618 --> 00:27:55,222
It wouldn't be
as much meat then.

566
00:27:55,287 --> 00:27:56,493
But it's still meat.

567
00:27:56,555 --> 00:27:59,001
What difference does it make
how much you have?

568
00:27:59,057 --> 00:28:01,003
You really don't like meat, huh?

569
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:03,335
No, Mother.
I don't like eating cows.

570
00:28:03,395 --> 00:28:08,344
Oh, honey, everything
comes from a cow.

571
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,903
Everything

572
00:28:13,271 --> 00:28:15,842
Come on in, honey. Sit.

573
00:28:15,907 --> 00:28:18,854
Ah...there.

574
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,857
You know, if you'd come
2 hours earlier,

575
00:28:21,913 --> 00:28:24,018
we could have had
dinner together.

576
00:28:24,082 --> 00:28:26,028
I made great beef stew.

577
00:28:31,923 --> 00:28:33,368
Here you are.

578
00:28:33,425 --> 00:28:34,870
There.

579
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,875
Thanks.

580
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:42,207
What else can I get for you?

581
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:43,871
No, Mother, I'll tell you.

582
00:28:43,935 --> 00:28:45,881
I'm really not hungry at all.

583
00:28:45,937 --> 00:28:48,884
I ate in a truck stop,
so this is fine.

584
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,886
Well, I have some
cold spaghetti,

585
00:28:50,942 --> 00:28:53,445
but it has meat sauce in it.

586
00:28:53,512 --> 00:28:55,219
Can you eat lamb chops?

587
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,817
What the hell is a lamb?
It's meat!

588
00:28:57,883 --> 00:28:59,726
I told you, I don't eat it.

589
00:28:59,784 --> 00:29:01,320
Well, it's not a cow.

590
00:29:01,386 --> 00:29:04,526
I didn't know if it was the animal
you were siding with

591
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:05,829
or the whole thing.

592
00:29:05,891 --> 00:29:07,097
The whole thing.

593
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:08,263
Want some cheese?

594
00:29:08,326 --> 00:29:10,966
No. The salad is fine,
I promise.

595
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:15,341
I'm going to give you
some cheese.

596
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,748
That's a lot of cheese.

597
00:29:20,805 --> 00:29:22,341
Got it in hunks.

598
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:24,353
Mother...

599
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:26,082
Look at the date!

600
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,680
It's 3 years old!

601
00:29:27,746 --> 00:29:29,692
Well, it's been in the freezer.

602
00:29:29,748 --> 00:29:32,854
Yeah, but how cheap was it that you
wanted to buy this much of it?

603
00:29:32,918 --> 00:29:34,522
Honey, this is wonderful cheese.

604
00:29:34,586 --> 00:29:37,032
It comes from Switzerland.
Very hard to get.

605
00:29:37,088 --> 00:29:39,364
How could it be hard to get?
It's all here!

606
00:29:40,425 --> 00:29:41,699
I don't want the cheese.

607
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,761
Now, dear--

608
00:29:42,827 --> 00:29:45,273
Mother, stop!
I don't want any!

609
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,536
Wait a minute.

610
00:29:46,598 --> 00:29:47,872
It's like This Old House

611
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:49,879
Well, you haven't
even tried it.

612
00:29:49,935 --> 00:29:53,212
I can tell by the gross weight
I'm not going to like it.

613
00:29:53,271 --> 00:29:55,217
I like my cheeses
in the ounces.

614
00:29:55,273 --> 00:29:58,220
When they weigh as much as a Fiat,
I get worried.

615
00:29:58,276 --> 00:29:59,277
Whatever.

616
00:29:59,344 --> 00:30:00,721
Can you eat Saltines?

617
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:02,884
Yes, of course
I can eat Saltines.

618
00:30:02,948 --> 00:30:05,554
Can't anybody?
That's what they give sick people.

619
00:30:05,617 --> 00:30:08,894
I just didn't know if there
was some sort of meat in it.

620
00:30:08,954 --> 00:30:10,729
I didn't know what they use.

621
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:12,894
Put it away, Mother.
I don't want it.

622
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:15,234
Just clear a portion
out of the refrigerator,

623
00:30:15,293 --> 00:30:18,240
and tomorrow, I'll go shopping
and get stuff that I like.

624
00:30:18,296 --> 00:30:19,741
You don't have to do that.

625
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:21,004
No, I want to.

626
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:23,376
I'm going to be here.
I want to have food to eat.

627
00:30:23,435 --> 00:30:25,574
You think you'll
be here long enough

628
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:27,446
that you need to go shopping?

629
00:30:27,505 --> 00:30:30,918
Yes. I wish you'd understand
what I'm doing here and support it.

630
00:30:33,979 --> 00:30:35,925
Whoo!

631
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:37,858
Yuck!

632
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:40,556
What's wrong?
There can't be meat in that.

633
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:42,599
This lettuce is 100 years old!

634
00:30:42,654 --> 00:30:45,658
What, did you get this from
the Smithsonian commissary?

635
00:30:45,724 --> 00:30:47,431
Honey, lettuce doesn't get old.

636
00:30:47,492 --> 00:30:50,132
Lettuce doesn't get old?
Where do you read that?

637
00:30:50,195 --> 00:30:52,038
You never heard
of wilted lettuce?

638
00:30:52,097 --> 00:30:54,304
Honey, I just took it
out of the freezer.

639
00:30:54,366 --> 00:30:55,743
You're freezing everything.

640
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,644
It was a good invention,
but it wasn't meant for everything.

641
00:30:58,703 --> 00:31:00,705
That's why it's smaller
than the refrigerator.

642
00:31:00,772 --> 00:31:04,151
You're not supposed to put
everything in that little box.

643
00:31:04,209 --> 00:31:06,052
I make my salads on Monday,

644
00:31:06,111 --> 00:31:08,057
and I keep them frozen all week.

645
00:31:08,113 --> 00:31:10,184
I think I know what I'm doing.

646
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:12,558
I know, but it doesn't
taste good to me.

647
00:31:12,617 --> 00:31:14,221
You're just not used to it.

648
00:31:14,286 --> 00:31:16,061
I don't want to get used to it.

649
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:17,896
I want to go to the market.

650
00:31:17,956 --> 00:31:19,162
How about some sherbet?

651
00:31:19,224 --> 00:31:22,330
Uh-oh. What kind of sherbet?

652
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:25,068
Oh, what do you mean?

653
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,906
It's delicious! Mmm.

654
00:31:30,435 --> 00:31:32,437
"Sweet Tooth"?

655
00:31:32,504 --> 00:31:35,246
Where do you find Sweet Tooth?

656
00:31:35,307 --> 00:31:37,253
I never hear of these brands.

657
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:40,222
There's a Baskin-Robbins
half a block from here.

658
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:41,757
I wouldn't go down there.

659
00:31:41,813 --> 00:31:43,258
That's a waste of money.

660
00:31:43,315 --> 00:31:45,090
I'm not going to fall for that.

661
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,596
What are you falling for?
They have ice cream in there.

662
00:31:47,652 --> 00:31:48,756
There’s no difference.

663
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,595
Why should I pay
triple the amount

664
00:31:50,655 --> 00:31:54,034
when they probably go to the supermarket
and buy the very same kind?

665
00:31:54,092 --> 00:31:56,470
Mother,
the ice cream is colorless.

666
00:31:56,528 --> 00:31:59,600
Look under the protective ice.

667
00:31:59,664 --> 00:32:01,871
The protective ice?

668
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:06,143
You've actually named the clear,
hard crap that sits on the top?

669
00:32:06,204 --> 00:32:08,878
Well, if you don't want it,
don't eat it.

670
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,887
You know, when I'm down and you
give me these words of wisdom

671
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:14,890
and you say to me, "Honey,
you don't need to see a shrink.

672
00:32:14,946 --> 00:32:16,755
Just don't be hard on yourself."

673
00:32:16,815 --> 00:32:19,887
How can I possibly do that
when I come from you?

674
00:32:19,951 --> 00:32:21,828
You're running a food museum here!

675
00:32:21,886 --> 00:32:23,888
Why can't you just
go buy fresh ice cream?

676
00:32:23,955 --> 00:32:25,559
Honey, you haven't
even tried it.

677
00:32:25,623 --> 00:32:27,398
You're making fun
of the ice cream,

678
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:29,234
and you haven't even tasted it.

679
00:32:29,294 --> 00:32:30,398
It's wonderful sherbet.

680
00:32:30,462 --> 00:32:32,908
I don't want it.
I'm not going to taste it.

681
00:32:32,964 --> 00:32:33,942
No?

682
00:32:33,998 --> 00:32:35,409
I don't want it.

683
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:37,003
You tell me...

684
00:32:37,068 --> 00:32:38,911
Aargh...

685
00:32:40,972 --> 00:32:42,417
Bleah!

686
00:32:42,474 --> 00:32:44,977
Oh, God, this is horribly old!

687
00:32:45,043 --> 00:32:48,923
This tastes like an orange foot!

688
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,324
Oh, my God almighty!

689
00:32:51,383 --> 00:32:53,420
Phooey! Yuck!

690
00:32:53,485 --> 00:32:56,022
You're the first one
that didn't like it.

691
00:32:56,087 --> 00:32:57,532
Oh, I bet.

692
00:32:57,589 --> 00:32:59,296
Buy your own, then.

693
00:32:59,357 --> 00:33:00,700
I'm exhausted.

694
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:02,705
I'm going to go take a bath.

695
00:33:02,761 --> 00:33:04,707
Eat whatever you want to eat.

696
00:33:04,763 --> 00:33:06,868
Just put the dishes
in the sink,

697
00:33:06,931 --> 00:33:09,377
and I'll see you in the morning,

698
00:33:09,434 --> 00:33:11,880
and then we'll talk
about the couch.

699
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:15,713
Such a surprise to have you here.

700
00:33:15,774 --> 00:33:17,879
Sleep well, Mother.

701
00:33:51,476 --> 00:33:52,921
Honey?

702
00:33:52,977 --> 00:33:54,752
Oh. Scared me.

703
00:33:54,813 --> 00:33:56,417
What are you doing?

704
00:33:56,481 --> 00:34:00,361
I just want to see how maybe I could
clear out some of these things.

705
00:34:00,418 --> 00:34:02,694
Dear, we were going to talk
about that tomorrow.

706
00:34:02,754 --> 00:34:04,529
I don't think it's a good idea.

707
00:34:04,589 --> 00:34:07,035
Mother, I really do want to
stay in this room.

708
00:34:07,091 --> 00:34:08,570
It's important to me.

709
00:34:08,626 --> 00:34:10,663
What are you trying to do?
Remind me.

710
00:34:10,728 --> 00:34:12,708
I'm trying to
recapture a feeling.

711
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:15,210
You want to stay in here
to recapture something.

712
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:17,712
Yeah. I want to see what feelings
it would bring up.

713
00:34:17,769 --> 00:34:20,215
What am I going to do with all this?
just leave it.

714
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:21,875
We'll put it
in the garage temporarily.

715
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,884
We can't do that.

716
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:23,885
Why?

717
00:34:23,942 --> 00:34:25,216
The garage is full of stuff.

718
00:34:25,276 --> 00:34:26,880
It's full of
all my high-school stuff.

719
00:34:26,945 --> 00:34:28,219
You saved everything.

720
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:30,725
Let me move it in here,
and I'll move this back there.

721
00:34:30,782 --> 00:34:32,056
What difference does it make?

722
00:34:32,116 --> 00:34:34,062
What about the car?
You might damage it.

723
00:34:34,118 --> 00:34:35,392
I'll pull the car out.

724
00:34:35,453 --> 00:34:36,898
And you'll put it back?

725
00:34:36,955 --> 00:34:38,730
No, I will never
put it back.

726
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,736
It will become
an Oldsmobile exhibit.

727
00:34:40,792 --> 00:34:43,238
We'll buy a big turntable,
it will revolve slowly,

728
00:34:43,294 --> 00:34:45,740
we'll get a good-looking girl
with a mike.

729
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:48,573
I don't want to get
everything dusty.

730
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:49,907
Look at this room!

731
00:34:49,968 --> 00:34:52,414
You've got chairs
piled up to the ceiling.

732
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,916
What difference does it make
if they get dusty?

733
00:34:54,973 --> 00:34:56,350
I plan to use those chairs.

734
00:34:56,407 --> 00:34:58,353
In what--some sort
of a vaudeville act?

735
00:34:58,409 --> 00:35:01,356
The furniture's very heavy,
and you're not strong enough,

736
00:35:01,412 --> 00:35:02,857
and I can't help you.

737
00:35:02,914 --> 00:35:04,689
I'll get somebody
off the street.

738
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:07,355
I can go down to Sears
and get one of those kids.

739
00:35:07,418 --> 00:35:08,863
You know how to do that?

740
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,194
How to do what?

741
00:35:10,255 --> 00:35:12,201
How to choose those men
on the corner.

742
00:35:12,257 --> 00:35:13,702
It's not an art form.

743
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:16,204
You just point to them,
and they get in the car.

744
00:35:16,261 --> 00:35:17,865
Don't overpay them.
It's insulting.

745
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:19,704
I read where they
don't like that.

746
00:35:19,764 --> 00:35:21,368
I know.
I read the same thing.

747
00:35:21,432 --> 00:35:23,878
When they get their paycheck
and it's huge, they feel violated.

748
00:35:23,935 --> 00:35:25,710
Well, they're different than us.

749
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:29,217
No.
You're different than them.

750
00:35:29,274 --> 00:35:30,651
Good night.

751
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:32,710
Good night, dear.

752
00:37:32,597 --> 00:37:36,374
And...ta-da!

753
00:37:36,434 --> 00:37:38,880
Oh, this is something!

754
00:37:38,936 --> 00:37:43,214
It looks exactly like it looked
when you were in school.

755
00:37:44,942 --> 00:37:47,218
I hope you know
what you're doing.

756
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,986
Honey, I'm not sure
where the camera is.

757
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,428
It's the tiny hole
right above the screen.

758
00:37:54,485 --> 00:37:57,591
I don't think I have
the same one you do.

759
00:37:57,655 --> 00:38:00,329
Yes, of course you do.
It's the same phone.

760
00:38:00,391 --> 00:38:01,995
Just move to your right.

761
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,233
Hold...

762
00:38:04,295 --> 00:38:05,501
To your left!

763
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:07,338
Honey, I can't hear you!

764
00:38:07,398 --> 00:38:10,345
Mother! Ma!

765
00:38:10,401 --> 00:38:12,847
Stay there!
That's good! Hold it!

766
00:38:12,904 --> 00:38:15,680
Just stay right there.
That's fine. Don't move.

767
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,946
Good enough.

768
00:38:17,008 --> 00:38:19,852
Look, I think that
he just wants to see

769
00:38:19,911 --> 00:38:22,187
what he can do
about your relationship.

770
00:38:22,246 --> 00:38:24,419
Well, what's wrong
with our relationship?

771
00:38:24,482 --> 00:38:27,691
Maybe we don't see as much
of each other as you and I,

772
00:38:27,752 --> 00:38:28,924
but it's fine.

773
00:38:28,986 --> 00:38:30,863
Just go with it
for a little while.

774
00:38:30,922 --> 00:38:32,492
I'm sure he'll get sick of it.

775
00:38:32,557 --> 00:38:35,197
Isn't there something wrong
with a grown man

776
00:38:35,259 --> 00:38:38,103
who puts his high-school things
back on the shelf?

777
00:38:38,162 --> 00:38:41,143
Well, he's a writer.
Chalk it up to that.

778
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:44,373
Oh, I don't think that has
anything to do with writing.

779
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:47,439
He's not that famous a writer
that he can afford to go nuts.

780
00:38:47,505 --> 00:38:50,315
He might be famous one day, Mom.
You never know.

781
00:38:50,374 --> 00:38:54,379
Really? Do you really
think that's possible?

782
00:38:54,445 --> 00:38:56,220
Do your people think so?

783
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,987
My people? They're athletes.

784
00:38:58,049 --> 00:39:00,825
I don't think they
even know who he is.

785
00:39:00,885 --> 00:39:02,592
That's my point.

786
00:39:02,653 --> 00:39:05,327
Don't you worry. I'm sure
he'll get tired of it soon.

787
00:39:05,389 --> 00:39:07,164
I'll call you later.
Love you.

788
00:39:13,898 --> 00:39:15,343
Oh, my God!

789
00:39:48,766 --> 00:39:50,370
Yeah?

790
00:39:50,434 --> 00:39:51,936
Didn't see you.

791
00:39:52,003 --> 00:39:54,506
This is what you do
when you're blocked?

792
00:39:54,572 --> 00:39:55,710
Sometimes.

793
00:39:55,773 --> 00:39:57,878
I'm going to go to the market.

794
00:39:57,942 --> 00:39:59,683
Be back in about an hour.

795
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:01,781
Oh, I want to go with you.

796
00:40:01,846 --> 00:40:03,382
Really?

797
00:40:03,447 --> 00:40:06,053
Well, come on.

798
00:40:38,482 --> 00:40:41,088
There's a space
right up here, Mother.

799
00:40:41,152 --> 00:40:42,426
Where?

800
00:40:42,486 --> 00:40:43,590
Right here!

801
00:40:43,654 --> 00:40:44,758
What space?

802
00:40:44,822 --> 00:40:45,926
There! There!

803
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,936
I was looking the other way.

804
00:40:47,992 --> 00:40:50,268
I don't think it was a space.

805
00:40:50,328 --> 00:40:52,274
It has to be a space.

806
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,606
Well, it's where they
put the baskets.

807
00:40:54,665 --> 00:40:56,201
Honey, I've been here before.

808
00:40:56,267 --> 00:40:57,712
You're making me nervous.

809
00:40:57,768 --> 00:41:00,374
I don't want to lose it,
that's all.

810
00:41:00,438 --> 00:41:01,712
Well, it's not--

811
00:41:01,772 --> 00:41:04,719
You're going around again.
No, no. Here. Right here.

812
00:41:04,775 --> 00:41:07,051
What are you doing?
It's right there!

813
00:41:07,111 --> 00:41:08,886
Oh, goodness.

814
00:41:08,946 --> 00:41:10,892
They didn't mark it well.

815
00:41:10,948 --> 00:41:13,224
This is like a ride
at Disneyland.

816
00:41:13,284 --> 00:41:14,729
Here we go again.

817
00:41:14,785 --> 00:41:16,890
I saw one down here
on the left.

818
00:41:16,954 --> 00:41:19,400
What do you mean, the left?
Right here!

819
00:41:19,457 --> 00:41:22,131
No. We are not
doing this again. No!

820
00:41:22,193 --> 00:41:23,399
Honey, don't do that!

821
00:41:23,461 --> 00:41:25,407
If you want to drive, drive,

822
00:41:25,463 --> 00:41:27,067
but don't grab the wheel.

823
00:41:27,131 --> 00:41:28,735
I had to do something.

824
00:41:28,799 --> 00:41:31,905
Someone had to stop us
from going around.

825
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:34,449
This was the space?

826
00:41:35,973 --> 00:41:37,577
You want a separate basket?

827
00:41:37,642 --> 00:41:38,586
Why?

828
00:41:38,643 --> 00:41:40,589
If I have some meat
products in here--

829
00:41:40,645 --> 00:41:42,591
I don't care
if meat's in the basket.

830
00:41:42,647 --> 00:41:44,422
I just don't want to ingest it.

831
00:41:44,482 --> 00:41:46,428
I didn't know
how far you take this.

832
00:41:46,484 --> 00:41:48,430
No, we can use the same basket.

833
00:41:48,486 --> 00:41:49,931
I think it's appropriate.

834
00:41:49,987 --> 00:41:51,261
Oh. OK.

835
00:41:52,857 --> 00:41:54,928
You want some peanut butter?

836
00:41:54,992 --> 00:41:57,370
As a matter of fact, I do.

837
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,875
"New-Taste"?

838
00:42:00,932 --> 00:42:02,377
Mm-hmm.

839
00:42:02,433 --> 00:42:04,379
I'm going to get the organic.

840
00:42:04,435 --> 00:42:06,381
Oh, honey,
there’s no difference.

841
00:42:06,437 --> 00:42:08,383
Yeah, but I like the organic.

842
00:42:08,439 --> 00:42:10,385
But there's no reason
to pay extra.

843
00:42:10,441 --> 00:42:12,387
This all comes from
the same place.

844
00:42:12,443 --> 00:42:14,320
The man told me
it's just the label.

845
00:42:14,378 --> 00:42:16,221
I don't think that's
necessarily true,

846
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,726
but in any case, I'm buying
my own peanut butter.

847
00:42:18,783 --> 00:42:20,057
I want the organic.

848
00:42:20,117 --> 00:42:22,063
I don't know why you
want to waste the money.

849
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:24,065
Why do you want to
throw it all away?

850
00:42:24,121 --> 00:42:26,397
Because that's exactly
what I want to do.

851
00:42:26,457 --> 00:42:29,233
I want an experience where we
throw away 91 cents together.

852
00:42:29,293 --> 00:42:30,738
You throw it away.

853
00:42:30,795 --> 00:42:34,072
New-Taste is as good as any of this,
and I won't be fooled.

854
00:42:34,131 --> 00:42:35,075
Organic!

855
00:42:36,634 --> 00:42:37,908
I have an idea.

856
00:42:37,969 --> 00:42:40,916
Let's buy the most expensive
jelly in the market.

857
00:42:40,972 --> 00:42:42,417
Oh, honey, you're something.

858
00:42:42,473 --> 00:42:45,579
Come on. What do you think
the most expensive jelly is?

859
00:42:45,643 --> 00:42:47,919
I don't buy jelly.
I don't know.

860
00:42:47,979 --> 00:42:49,925
Oh, this looks very good.

861
00:42:49,981 --> 00:42:51,255
Oh, don't get that!

862
00:42:51,315 --> 00:42:52,589
Why?

863
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:55,529
Because it's too expensive.
That's a waste of money.

864
00:42:55,586 --> 00:42:58,362
Look, you can get
a whole jar here for $2.50.

865
00:42:58,422 --> 00:43:00,368
Why would you want
to spend $10.95?

866
00:43:00,424 --> 00:43:02,370
Because, thank God,
I can afford it,

867
00:43:02,426 --> 00:43:03,871
and it might be good.

868
00:43:03,928 --> 00:43:06,204
Come on, Mother.
Let's experience this together.

869
00:43:06,263 --> 00:43:07,867
I don't want this experience!

870
00:43:07,932 --> 00:43:10,378
You're fooled by these names,
all that fancy wrapping.

871
00:43:10,434 --> 00:43:12,038
I'm not fooled by anything.

872
00:43:12,103 --> 00:43:14,049
This isn't what
the experiment's about.

873
00:43:14,105 --> 00:43:15,709
It's not about being fooled.

874
00:43:15,773 --> 00:43:17,047
It's about splurging.

875
00:43:17,108 --> 00:43:18,712
You see, I realize something.

876
00:43:18,776 --> 00:43:21,052
I think you treat yourself
very cheaply,

877
00:43:21,112 --> 00:43:22,557
and I think therefore

878
00:43:22,613 --> 00:43:24,559
you have instilled
that into me.

879
00:43:24,615 --> 00:43:26,891
I don't treat myself
cheaply at all.

880
00:43:26,951 --> 00:43:29,727
I lived through The Depression.
You didn't.

881
00:43:29,787 --> 00:43:31,733
The Depression!
You were 2.

882
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:34,395
By the way, things
aren't so great right now.

883
00:43:34,458 --> 00:43:36,062
Well, it's not the thirties.

884
00:43:36,127 --> 00:43:39,404
You don't have to
wait in line to buy bread.

885
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,507
Yes. Sourdough, please.

886
00:43:48,005 --> 00:43:50,747
You know, I've heard
this Depression story a lot,

887
00:43:50,808 --> 00:43:52,754
but I don't know
what it has to do

888
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:54,414
with splurging for jam now.

889
00:43:54,478 --> 00:43:56,355
We're in the nineties, Mother.

890
00:43:56,414 --> 00:43:57,688
It's fancy-jam time.

891
00:43:57,748 --> 00:43:59,193
See, I realize something.

892
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,854
We don't like ourselves enough.

893
00:44:00,918 --> 00:44:02,522
You don't give yourself anything.

894
00:44:02,586 --> 00:44:04,190
I don't give myself anything.

895
00:44:04,255 --> 00:44:05,529
It's all so clear!

896
00:44:05,589 --> 00:44:09,036
Shh. Honey, I don't want
to have this discussion now.

897
00:44:09,093 --> 00:44:10,868
I like myself very much.

898
00:44:10,928 --> 00:44:14,535
Just because I don't want to
spend $10 for bullshit jam

899
00:44:14,598 --> 00:44:17,875
has nothing to do with
what I feel about myself!

900
00:44:17,935 --> 00:44:20,882
I never heard you use
the word bullshit before.

901
00:44:20,938 --> 00:44:23,544
You never heard me
use a lot of words.

902
00:44:23,607 --> 00:44:24,881
Oh! What a waste.

903
00:44:24,942 --> 00:44:26,888
For God's sakes,
looks like a toy!

904
00:44:26,944 --> 00:44:29,891
The checker's going to have
a good laugh over this.

905
00:44:29,947 --> 00:44:32,223
Mother, can't you just
forget about it?

906
00:44:32,283 --> 00:44:34,388
Can't you throw
caution to the wind?

907
00:44:34,452 --> 00:44:37,899
Caution I can throw all day.
jelly is another matter.

908
00:44:37,955 --> 00:44:39,730
My goodness, a brand.

909
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:41,394
What’s the matter?

910
00:44:41,459 --> 00:44:43,405
Don't they make New-Nuts?

911
00:44:43,461 --> 00:44:45,407
I enjoy my Grape-Nuts.

912
00:44:45,463 --> 00:44:46,908
I know you do.

913
00:44:50,935 --> 00:44:53,916
Hmm, I need some Sweet Tooth.

914
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:08,692
<i>Shoppers,
there's no waiting at check stand 5.</i>

915
00:45:08,752 --> 00:45:10,356
<i>No waiting, check stand 5.</i>

916
00:45:10,421 --> 00:45:13,368
If you tell me there's
a difference between salt,

917
00:45:13,424 --> 00:45:15,370
I'm really going to get upset.

918
00:45:15,426 --> 00:45:17,702
You do not know how to market.

919
00:45:17,761 --> 00:45:20,367
No, I know there's
no difference between salt.

920
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:22,377
I know salt's all the same.

921
00:45:22,433 --> 00:45:24,037
It's all all the same!

922
00:45:24,101 --> 00:45:26,103
It's not all all the same!

923
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:28,047
Beatrice! Hello!
This is my sister.

924
00:45:28,105 --> 00:45:30,051
Sis, this is
my neighbor Beatrice.

925
00:45:30,107 --> 00:45:31,415
How do you do?

926
00:45:31,475 --> 00:45:32,715
I forget your name.

927
00:45:32,776 --> 00:45:34,449
Alice.

928
00:45:34,512 --> 00:45:36,355
So nice to see you, Beatrice.

929
00:45:36,413 --> 00:45:38,893
Alice is going to
be here for a week,

930
00:45:38,949 --> 00:45:41,225
and then she's taking
a cruise to Mexico.

931
00:45:41,285 --> 00:45:42,730
Oh, my-- a cruise!

932
00:45:42,786 --> 00:45:44,060
Oh, my!

933
00:45:44,121 --> 00:45:45,566
I'm, uh, John.

934
00:45:45,623 --> 00:45:47,933
This is my son--
the other one.

935
00:45:47,992 --> 00:45:49,062
Oh.

936
00:45:49,126 --> 00:45:51,072
He's staying with me
for a while.

937
00:45:51,128 --> 00:45:52,402
He likes this jelly.

938
00:45:52,463 --> 00:45:53,771
Look at that!

939
00:45:53,831 --> 00:45:55,868
Oh, I've heard of that.
It's organic.

940
00:45:55,933 --> 00:45:57,344
You've heard of it?

941
00:45:57,401 --> 00:46:00,348
Oh, yes. They're very big
in the catalog business.

942
00:46:00,404 --> 00:46:01,849
Really!

943
00:46:01,906 --> 00:46:05,353
Yes. I hear their jelly is wonderful,
and you know what else?

944
00:46:05,409 --> 00:46:09,221
They have a peanut butter for $12
that's out of this world.

945
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,692
Well, just think of that.

946
00:46:11,749 --> 00:46:13,524
Leave it to my son.

947
00:46:13,584 --> 00:46:15,621
So, you're the writer?

948
00:46:15,686 --> 00:46:16,858
Yes.

949
00:46:16,921 --> 00:46:19,026
Well, he hasn't written
anything for a while,

950
00:46:19,089 --> 00:46:21,035
but he's working on a new book.

951
00:46:21,091 --> 00:46:22,661
Thanks for the intro, Mother.

952
00:46:22,726 --> 00:46:24,137
What are you writing?

953
00:46:24,195 --> 00:46:26,539
I'm working on
a science fiction novel.

954
00:46:26,597 --> 00:46:27,837
Like Stephen King.

955
00:46:27,898 --> 00:46:29,673
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

956
00:46:29,733 --> 00:46:32,714
Now, Stephen King
could afford this jelly.

957
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:34,716
My son, I'm not so sure.

958
00:46:35,973 --> 00:46:38,214
Let's go. We got
a lot of shopping to do.

959
00:46:38,275 --> 00:46:39,253
Excuse us.

960
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:41,051
I will speak to you, Beatrice.

961
00:46:41,111 --> 00:46:42,215
Nice to see you.

962
00:46:42,279 --> 00:46:43,883
Nice to see you, too, John.

963
00:46:43,948 --> 00:46:46,224
Nice to see you.
Have a nice trip to Mexico.

964
00:46:46,283 --> 00:46:47,227
Thank you.

965
00:46:47,284 --> 00:46:48,388
Don't drink the water.

966
00:46:48,452 --> 00:46:49,863
You see what you do?

967
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,729
All you do
is apologize for me!

968
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:53,393
I don't apologize
for you at all.

969
00:46:53,457 --> 00:46:56,165
Maybe I am a little embarrassed
about the jelly. So what?

970
00:46:56,227 --> 00:46:58,173
Why would you be embarrassed
about the jelly?

971
00:46:58,229 --> 00:46:59,503
Didn't her sister like it?

972
00:46:59,563 --> 00:47:01,008
Her sister doesn't know anything.

973
00:47:01,065 --> 00:47:02,840
You want to know
something about her?

974
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,174
No, I really don't.

975
00:47:04,235 --> 00:47:06,681
She was in some sort
of institution for a few years.

976
00:47:06,737 --> 00:47:08,341
Nobody knows what really happened.

977
00:47:08,405 --> 00:47:11,011
She went insane for spending
a few dollars more for her food.

978
00:47:12,409 --> 00:47:13,513
Oh, my goodness!

979
00:47:13,577 --> 00:47:14,715
Oh, my.

980
00:47:14,778 --> 00:47:16,018
What did we do?

981
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,356
We must have come around
the same way.

982
00:47:18,415 --> 00:47:19,689
I told you.

983
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:21,195
This market's so confusing.

984
00:47:21,252 --> 00:47:22,697
I thought this was
the freezer.

985
00:47:22,753 --> 00:47:24,198
They don't have a freezer.

986
00:47:24,255 --> 00:47:25,359
Of course they do.

987
00:47:25,422 --> 00:47:27,368
Where were you trying to go?

988
00:47:27,424 --> 00:47:28,869
To the freezer.

989
00:47:28,926 --> 00:47:31,372
And you came around
the same way?

990
00:47:31,428 --> 00:47:33,032
That's so funny!

991
00:47:33,097 --> 00:47:34,838
That is so funny!

992
00:47:34,898 --> 00:47:36,377
It's not that funny.

993
00:47:36,433 --> 00:47:37,810
Mother, let's go.

994
00:47:37,868 --> 00:47:39,245
We're right back
where we started.

995
00:47:39,303 --> 00:47:40,873
You know what they just did?

996
00:47:40,938 --> 00:47:42,212
Don't tell the clerk!

997
00:47:43,774 --> 00:47:46,550
We're going to turn into skeletons
with this conversation.

998
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:48,146
Can you believe this?

999
00:47:48,212 --> 00:47:50,886
Mother, I beg you, let's go.

1000
00:47:50,948 --> 00:47:52,723
Oh, he wants to go.

1001
00:47:52,783 --> 00:47:55,423
That's so funny!
I'll talk to you later.

1002
00:47:55,486 --> 00:47:58,330
Come on, honey.
Let's get your nonmeat things.

1003
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:01,335
That's very funny.

1004
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,354
Honey, look.

1005
00:48:24,415 --> 00:48:26,019
I cleared out the refrigerator.

1006
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:28,359
I'm going to give you
the right-hand side,

1007
00:48:28,419 --> 00:48:30,365
and I'll put your stuff there.

1008
00:48:30,421 --> 00:48:33,027
It's like It Happened One Night
for food.

1009
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:36,367
Oh, I love that movie.
Clark Gable was wonderful.

1010
00:48:36,427 --> 00:48:39,374
Do you really want to separate
the refrigerator?

1011
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:41,706
Oh, yes, dear.
It'll be much easier.

1012
00:48:41,765 --> 00:48:44,371
That way you won't
accidentally eat some meat.

1013
00:48:44,435 --> 00:48:47,041
It's good that you
know that about me.

1014
00:48:47,104 --> 00:48:49,380
I accidentally eat things
all day long.

1015
00:48:57,781 --> 00:48:59,556
What are you doing?

1016
00:48:59,616 --> 00:49:02,825
I can't get it to fit
completely on my side.

1017
00:49:02,886 --> 00:49:06,424
It's just going to have
to stick over a little.

1018
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:09,494
Mother, would you forget
the separation?

1019
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,335
Just leave the refrigerator alone.

1020
00:49:11,395 --> 00:49:13,671
I can get the stuff
that I like.

1021
00:49:13,731 --> 00:49:15,836
I just thought I'd
make it easier for you.

1022
00:49:15,899 --> 00:49:17,344
Then don't manage the food.

1023
00:49:17,401 --> 00:49:19,347
My eyes are connected
to my brain

1024
00:49:19,403 --> 00:49:20,848
like in a real person.

1025
00:49:20,904 --> 00:49:23,510
I know exactly what it is
that I want to eat.

1026
00:49:23,574 --> 00:49:26,680
Fine. If you'd rather not
divide it up, we don't divide it up.

1027
00:49:26,744 --> 00:49:28,849
Would you like
some of your food now?

1028
00:49:28,912 --> 00:49:30,516
Yes. I'm a little hungry.

1029
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:32,185
Let me make you something.

1030
00:49:32,249 --> 00:49:35,025
Why don't you set the table
and sit down?

1031
00:49:36,587 --> 00:49:39,693
Honey, tell me again,
because people will start asking--

1032
00:49:39,757 --> 00:49:41,828
You're here why?

1033
00:49:41,892 --> 00:49:43,200
Why?

1034
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:46,605
Well, it's complicated, Mother,
but you know why.

1035
00:49:46,663 --> 00:49:49,542
Well, you're having problems,
and you're blaming me.

1036
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,704
Is that it?

1037
00:49:50,768 --> 00:49:52,645
I'm not blaming anyone.

1038
00:49:52,703 --> 00:49:55,377
It's just that things
aren't working out so great

1039
00:49:55,439 --> 00:49:57,885
with the women
in my life right now,

1040
00:49:57,941 --> 00:50:01,388
and I feel that, until I
can figure this situation out,

1041
00:50:01,445 --> 00:50:04,892
I probably will never be able
to figure that situation out.

1042
00:50:04,948 --> 00:50:07,224
So, you know,
whatever I learn here,

1043
00:50:07,284 --> 00:50:10,891
I'll take into that part
of my life and apply it there.

1044
00:50:10,954 --> 00:50:13,696
Hey! That's a very
good way to say it.

1045
00:50:13,757 --> 00:50:15,566
Hmm?
Oh, I wasn't listening.

1046
00:50:15,626 --> 00:50:16,900
Tell them what?

1047
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,735
This is one of the problems.

1048
00:50:18,796 --> 00:50:20,400
Just don't tell them anything.

1049
00:50:20,464 --> 00:50:21,807
Forget it.

1050
00:50:21,865 --> 00:50:25,904
Yes. I could pretend you're here
for just a regular reason.

1051
00:50:25,969 --> 00:50:28,575
Yeah--like a visit.
I'm your son.

1052
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:31,745
Yes, of course. You could be here
for any kind of a reason.

1053
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:34,085
For example, you could
have injured yourself,

1054
00:50:34,144 --> 00:50:36,420
and you need me
to take care of you.

1055
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,756
I'm not going to limp
for you, Mother.

1056
00:50:38,816 --> 00:50:40,420
No, no.
Some internal injury.

1057
00:50:42,252 --> 00:50:45,597
So you're not making it work
with the women, dear?

1058
00:50:45,656 --> 00:50:48,603
No. Things aren't going
so great right now.

1059
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:50,605
Oh, Karen was lovely.

1060
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:52,607
What was the problem there again?

1061
00:50:52,663 --> 00:50:54,267
She didn't support me.

1062
00:50:54,331 --> 00:50:55,708
Did you support her?

1063
00:50:55,766 --> 00:50:57,268
Yeah, I supported her.

1064
00:50:57,334 --> 00:50:59,871
Did you, dear?
I remember when she want...

1065
00:50:59,937 --> 00:51:01,541
Oh, I forget which one.

1066
00:51:01,605 --> 00:51:04,051
What did she want to do
that you didn't want?

1067
00:51:04,107 --> 00:51:05,051
Leave me.

1068
00:51:05,108 --> 00:51:06,883
Oh. Why would you
support that?

1069
00:51:06,944 --> 00:51:09,891
The hell with her, dear.
She wasn't that cute anyway.

1070
00:51:09,947 --> 00:51:11,551
Mother, I'm fine with her.

1071
00:51:11,615 --> 00:51:13,720
We don't have to trash her looks.

1072
00:51:13,784 --> 00:51:15,092
What are you doing?

1073
00:51:15,152 --> 00:51:18,395
Stop! No more food!
It's like Fantasia!

1074
00:51:18,455 --> 00:51:20,059
You said you were hungry.

1075
00:51:20,123 --> 00:51:21,397
For my whole life,

1076
00:51:21,458 --> 00:51:24,234
I've never been able to deal
with these food questions.

1077
00:51:24,294 --> 00:51:25,739
You ask me if I'm hungry,

1078
00:51:25,796 --> 00:51:27,571
I tell you yes,
you bring me food.

1079
00:51:27,631 --> 00:51:29,076
You ask me if I'm hungry,

1080
00:51:29,132 --> 00:51:30,907
I tell you no,
you bring me food.

1081
00:51:30,968 --> 00:51:32,413
You ask me the questions,

1082
00:51:32,469 --> 00:51:33,914
but you don't listen
to the answers,

1083
00:51:33,971 --> 00:51:35,416
so I know I'm
going to get food

1084
00:51:35,472 --> 00:51:36,917
no matter what I tell you.

1085
00:51:36,974 --> 00:51:39,420
Therefore, I adjust how hungry
I tell you I am

1086
00:51:39,476 --> 00:51:41,752
to know how much food
I'm going to get.

1087
00:51:41,812 --> 00:51:44,122
From now on,
just bring what you want.

1088
00:51:44,181 --> 00:51:46,422
Really. I'll eat
what you bring me,

1089
00:51:46,483 --> 00:51:48,588
or I won't eat what
you bring me.

1090
00:51:48,652 --> 00:51:49,926
It doesn't matter.

1091
00:51:49,987 --> 00:51:52,934
Bring it anyway, and that's
the end of the food deal.

1092
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:56,733
Honey, I never knew it was
this much of a problem.

1093
00:51:56,793 --> 00:51:59,364
I will never ask you
about food anymore.

1094
00:51:59,429 --> 00:52:01,375
Oh, Mother, you can ask me,

1095
00:52:01,431 --> 00:52:03,377
but you know what I mean.

1096
00:52:03,433 --> 00:52:06,039
Oh, I just wish
your father were alive

1097
00:52:06,103 --> 00:52:09,050
so he could take
a little of this blame.

1098
00:52:09,106 --> 00:52:11,052
Is that a joke?

1099
00:52:11,108 --> 00:52:12,883
Yes, it is, honey.

1100
00:52:12,943 --> 00:52:15,890
Every time you say something funny,
I'm shocked.

1101
00:52:15,946 --> 00:52:17,050
I know.

1102
00:52:17,114 --> 00:52:20,391
You must think of me
as some sort of moron.

1103
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:22,054
No, no. Not a moron.

1104
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:24,395
Just someone
who thinks I'm a moron.

1105
00:52:24,454 --> 00:52:26,559
Well, it takes one
to know one,

1106
00:52:26,623 --> 00:52:27,897
doesn't it, dear?

1107
00:52:29,459 --> 00:52:31,405
So, let me ask you something.

1108
00:52:31,461 --> 00:52:34,067
The son does get more
from his mother,

1109
00:52:34,131 --> 00:52:35,735
for the most part, anyway,

1110
00:52:35,799 --> 00:52:37,403
than his father,
doesn't he?

1111
00:52:37,467 --> 00:52:40,073
YES, in your case,
but not all the time.

1112
00:52:40,137 --> 00:52:43,141
Well, who instilled
the cheapness and self-loathing?

1113
00:52:43,206 --> 00:52:44,913
You, right?

1114
00:52:44,975 --> 00:52:46,921
Dear, I'm tired.

1115
00:52:46,977 --> 00:52:49,389
We can berate me tomorrow.

1116
00:52:50,981 --> 00:52:52,255
I love you, Mother.

1117
00:52:52,316 --> 00:52:54,125
You know,
if you talk to the women

1118
00:52:54,184 --> 00:52:56,027
the way you talk to me
sometimes,

1119
00:52:56,086 --> 00:52:58,225
I can see why
they all leave you.

1120
00:52:58,288 --> 00:53:00,199
They didn't all leave me.

1121
00:53:00,257 --> 00:53:01,861
I left some of them.

1122
00:53:01,925 --> 00:53:03,871
Really!

1123
00:53:03,927 --> 00:53:05,873
I didn't know that.

1124
00:53:17,941 --> 00:53:20,421
It is morning
on this strange planet.

1125
00:53:20,477 --> 00:53:23,083
We do not know
where we are,

1126
00:53:23,146 --> 00:53:26,218
but we are safe,
at least for the moment.

1127
00:53:26,283 --> 00:53:29,992
What is outside,
no one will ever know.

1128
00:53:31,822 --> 00:53:34,359
What is outside, nobody..

1129
00:53:42,733 --> 00:53:44,610
It is morning
on this strange planet.

1130
00:53:44,668 --> 00:53:47,615
We do not know where we are, but we
are safe, at least for the moment.

1131
00:53:47,671 --> 00:53:50,083
What is outside,
nobody will ever know.

1132
00:53:52,943 --> 00:53:55,116
No one?

1133
00:53:55,178 --> 00:53:56,418
No one.

1134
00:53:59,349 --> 00:54:03,354
What is outside,
no one will ever know.

1135
00:54:05,188 --> 00:54:06,258
Honey?

1136
00:54:06,323 --> 00:54:07,893
Yeah?

1137
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:10,438
I'm going out,
and I'll be back later.

1138
00:54:10,494 --> 00:54:12,371
Are you all right?

1139
00:54:12,429 --> 00:54:14,067
Yeah. Where are you going?

1140
00:54:14,131 --> 00:54:17,078
I have some shopping
and things to do.

1141
00:54:17,134 --> 00:54:19,580
Oh, look at this!

1142
00:54:19,636 --> 00:54:22,082
This is beautiful.

1143
00:54:22,139 --> 00:54:24,176
Oh, you never saw one before?

1144
00:54:24,241 --> 00:54:26,915
Only in the store.
My goodness, look what they've done.

1145
00:54:26,977 --> 00:54:28,422
Did you ever use one?

1146
00:54:28,478 --> 00:54:29,513
No.

1147
00:54:29,579 --> 00:54:31,081
Do you know how to type?

1148
00:54:31,148 --> 00:54:32,593
Do I know how to type?

1149
00:54:32,649 --> 00:54:34,595
I was the fastest typist
in my class.

1150
00:54:34,651 --> 00:54:35,595
Number one.

1151
00:54:35,652 --> 00:54:36,790
But it was manual.

1152
00:54:36,853 --> 00:54:38,526
Then they didn't
do all those things.

1153
00:54:38,588 --> 00:54:40,124
Come on.
You got to try it.

1154
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:41,760
Oh, no, I couldn't do that.

1155
00:54:41,825 --> 00:54:43,270
No. Try it. It's easy.

1156
00:54:43,326 --> 00:54:44,862
It's the same as manual.

1157
00:54:44,928 --> 00:54:46,771
It just does it all for you.

1158
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:48,070
Let's see.

1159
00:54:54,671 --> 00:54:56,014
Mother!

1160
00:55:00,744 --> 00:55:02,485
You're amazing!

1161
00:55:02,546 --> 00:55:06,119
No mistakes, and you're fast.

1162
00:55:06,183 --> 00:55:08,493
I'm impressed.

1163
00:55:08,552 --> 00:55:11,192
I never knew this.

1164
00:55:11,254 --> 00:55:14,258
Your mother does a lot of things
you don't know.

1165
00:55:14,324 --> 00:55:15,860
Well, that's why I'm here.

1166
00:55:15,926 --> 00:55:17,564
Tell me everything.

1167
00:55:17,627 --> 00:55:19,732
You came here
to find out what I do?

1168
00:55:19,796 --> 00:55:21,332
I thought you came here because

1169
00:55:21,398 --> 00:55:22,968
of the problems with the women.

1170
00:55:23,033 --> 00:55:24,535
The problems with the women,

1171
00:55:24,601 --> 00:55:27,172
to find out what you do--
the whole thing. Come on.

1172
00:55:27,237 --> 00:55:28,841
Not now, dear. I have to go.

1173
00:55:28,905 --> 00:55:31,078
Oh, Mother?

1174
00:55:31,141 --> 00:55:34,350
I'm taking you out to dinner tonight,
so be ready at 8:00.

1175
00:55:34,411 --> 00:55:35,754
What?

1176
00:55:35,812 --> 00:55:36,813
We have a date.

1177
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,518
I want you to be ready
at 8:00 sharp.

1178
00:55:38,582 --> 00:55:39,890
I'll pick you up in your room.

1179
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:42,055
Honey, you don't have to do that.
I'll make something.

1180
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:43,757
No more house cheese.

1181
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:46,460
This is going to be
a very special evening.

1182
00:55:46,523 --> 00:55:47,467
Hmm!

1183
00:56:11,648 --> 00:56:13,787
To the experiment,
whatever it is.

1184
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:15,761
To the experiment.

1185
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,530
And you look good.

1186
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:28,409
But?

1187
00:56:28,465 --> 00:56:30,308
What, dear?

1188
00:56:30,367 --> 00:56:32,074
Just wondering
when the but's coming.

1189
00:56:32,135 --> 00:56:33,739
Is that what you think I do?

1190
00:56:33,804 --> 00:56:35,579
I don't think you do it.
That's what you do.

1191
00:56:35,639 --> 00:56:37,084
I don't mean anything by it.

1192
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,585
It's just something
a mother does.

1193
00:56:38,642 --> 00:56:40,417
I don't know that
every mother does that.

1194
00:56:40,477 --> 00:56:42,252
I don't think
every mother says,

1195
00:56:42,312 --> 00:56:44,883
"Honey, you look good,
but your hair is thinning."

1196
00:56:44,948 --> 00:56:47,394
Honey, I never told you
your hair was thinning.

1197
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:48,588
Yes, you did.

1198
00:56:48,652 --> 00:56:50,757
The last time
I was at the house,

1199
00:56:50,821 --> 00:56:52,858
on my way out
you called after me,

1200
00:56:52,923 --> 00:56:55,096
"Look out for your bald spot."
Remember?

1201
00:56:55,158 --> 00:56:57,764
Well, someone has to say that.

1202
00:56:57,828 --> 00:57:01,833
And by the way, whatever you did,
it looks wonderful.

1203
00:57:01,898 --> 00:57:03,104
You can barely tell.

1204
00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:04,770
I used that Minoxidil stuff.

1205
00:57:04,835 --> 00:57:06,178
I was one of the lucky ones.

1206
00:57:06,236 --> 00:57:09,046
But it doesn't work up here, hmm?

1207
00:57:09,105 --> 00:57:10,550
What are you-- What is--Why?

1208
00:57:10,607 --> 00:57:12,109
Why should it work up here?

1209
00:57:12,175 --> 00:57:14,587
I have hair here.
I didn't even put it here.

1210
00:57:14,644 --> 00:57:15,714
I see there's hair there.

1211
00:57:15,779 --> 00:57:17,053
No, no, dear. I was just--

1212
00:57:17,113 --> 00:57:18,615
It's for the back.

1213
00:57:18,682 --> 00:57:20,628
That's where I put it.
That's where it worked.

1214
00:57:20,684 --> 00:57:22,630
Oh, that's a miracle.

1215
00:57:22,686 --> 00:57:24,427
Just think.

1216
00:57:24,487 --> 00:57:25,989
It was a blood pressure medicine.

1217
00:57:26,056 --> 00:57:27,558
Isn't that funny?

1218
00:57:27,624 --> 00:57:30,070
They accidentally
found out it grew hair.

1219
00:57:30,126 --> 00:57:32,572
Isn't that the way
it always works?

1220
00:57:32,629 --> 00:57:36,076
They always accidentally
find something.

1221
00:57:36,132 --> 00:57:38,738
Do you know how the cane
was invented?

1222
00:57:38,802 --> 00:57:40,247
No.

1223
00:57:46,509 --> 00:57:47,544
How?

1224
00:57:47,611 --> 00:57:50,251
Oh, I don't know, dear.

1225
00:57:50,313 --> 00:57:53,522
I just can't imagine
that was its original purpose.

1226
00:57:58,488 --> 00:57:59,865
Thank you.

1227
00:57:59,923 --> 00:58:01,095
That looks delicious.

1228
00:58:01,157 --> 00:58:02,465
Looks lovely.

1229
00:58:02,525 --> 00:58:03,731
And you, sir.

1230
00:58:03,793 --> 00:58:05,397
Thank you very much.

1231
00:58:05,462 --> 00:58:07,533
Would you like another martini?

1232
00:58:07,597 --> 00:58:08,803
Oh, no.

1233
00:58:08,865 --> 00:58:11,141
Yes. 2 olives.

1234
00:58:14,271 --> 00:58:16,114
I'm fine. Thank you.

1235
00:58:20,277 --> 00:58:23,019
You don't speak to your brother
very much, do you, dear?

1236
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:25,059
No. No, I don't.

1237
00:58:25,115 --> 00:58:26,423
I wonder why.

1238
00:58:26,483 --> 00:58:28,258
Maybe it's the age difference.

1239
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:30,059
Well, age difference,
every difference.

1240
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,623
You know, we're just different.
That's all.

1241
00:58:32,689 --> 00:58:36,068
I just wish you could meet
a girl like Cheryl.

1242
00:58:36,126 --> 00:58:38,572
She's a wonderful girl,
don't you think?

1243
00:58:38,628 --> 00:58:40,733
I like her.
Yeah, she's very nice.

1244
00:58:40,797 --> 00:58:42,105
So what happened?

1245
00:58:42,165 --> 00:58:44,736
You just had some bad luck?

1246
00:58:44,801 --> 00:58:46,178
What do you mean?

1247
00:58:46,236 --> 00:58:48,716
I just mean, he seemed
to hit it off right away,

1248
00:58:48,772 --> 00:58:52,276
and they have children, and they're
happy, and you haven't found it.

1249
00:58:52,342 --> 00:58:54,117
Well, I can't help that, Mother.

1250
00:58:54,177 --> 00:58:56,623
I can't help who I am.
What am I supposed to do?

1251
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,626
Of course not, dear.
I know that.

1252
00:58:58,682 --> 00:59:01,424
I'm just saying it's interesting
how someone has good luck

1253
00:59:01,484 --> 00:59:03,225
and someone has bad luck.

1254
00:59:03,286 --> 00:59:07,098
Mother, I don't look at my life
as good luck and bad luck, you know?

1255
00:59:07,157 --> 00:59:09,865
I'm on a quest.
We're different people.

1256
00:59:09,926 --> 00:59:12,532
He's an agent.
I'm a writer.

1257
00:59:12,595 --> 00:59:15,007
There's a big difference there.

1258
00:59:15,065 --> 00:59:16,544
You know something?

1259
00:59:16,599 --> 00:59:19,045
Maybe you should write
about that.

1260
00:59:19,102 --> 00:59:20,547
What did you say?

1261
00:59:20,603 --> 00:59:22,605
I just think you
should think about

1262
00:59:22,672 --> 00:59:24,709
writing about real
things--you know,

1263
00:59:24,774 --> 00:59:27,550
people, instead of all that
science fiction all the time.

1264
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:29,453
Science fiction has people in it.

1265
00:59:29,512 --> 00:59:31,389
What kind of a comment is that?

1266
00:59:31,448 --> 00:59:33,121
It's not a bad comment, dear.

1267
00:59:33,183 --> 00:59:34,526
It's just my opinion.

1268
00:59:34,584 --> 00:59:36,723
I mean, I just think
it would be interesting

1269
00:59:36,786 --> 00:59:38,788
to write about
what's really right here

1270
00:59:38,855 --> 00:59:40,892
instead of all
that made-up stuff--

1271
00:59:40,957 --> 00:59:42,561
you know,
with the large heads.

1272
00:59:42,625 --> 00:59:46,163
And what was that one character
you had with just a big hand?

1273
00:59:46,229 --> 00:59:48,231
Even if I wrote
about "right here,"

1274
00:59:48,298 --> 00:59:50,539
I'd have to make it up,
wouldn't I?

1275
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:54,241
Isn't it more visionary to make up
a world that doesn't even exist?

1276
00:59:54,304 --> 00:59:55,282
Maybe.

1277
00:59:55,338 --> 00:59:57,784
Well, maybe you're right.
You're right.

1278
00:59:57,841 --> 01:00:00,082
Mother, you don't have to
like science fiction.

1279
01:00:00,143 --> 01:00:02,749
I'm not going to bully you
into liking the genre.

1280
01:00:02,812 --> 01:00:04,519
No, dear,
I love science fiction.

1281
01:00:04,581 --> 01:00:06,083
No, you don't.

1282
01:00:06,149 --> 01:00:08,857
Oh, yes, I do.
I think it's very creative.

1283
01:00:08,918 --> 01:00:12,764
But not as creative as, what--
a story about brothers?

1284
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:17,338
You know, dear,
you misunderstand me.

1285
01:00:17,394 --> 01:00:20,000
I know. Vice versa.

1286
01:00:25,201 --> 01:00:26,874
Well, let's change the subject.

1287
01:00:26,936 --> 01:00:28,506
To a new subject.

1288
01:00:28,571 --> 01:00:29,743
New subject.

1289
01:00:35,145 --> 01:00:37,386
Maybe when you
stopped eating meat,

1290
01:00:37,447 --> 01:00:39,586
your writing became
a little thinner.

1291
01:00:46,289 --> 01:00:47,563
Oh, dear, the phone.

1292
01:00:47,624 --> 01:00:49,570
Why don't you get
an answering machine?

1293
01:00:49,626 --> 01:00:52,232
I had one, but it broke.
I never got it fixed.

1294
01:00:52,295 --> 01:00:54,366
You don't get them fixed.
You throw them away.

1295
01:00:54,431 --> 01:00:55,409
Hello?

1296
01:00:55,465 --> 01:00:56,443
Hi, Mom.

1297
01:00:56,499 --> 01:00:57,603
Oh, hi, honey.

1298
01:00:57,667 --> 01:00:59,340
Sit down in front
of the camera.

1299
01:00:59,402 --> 01:01:02,076
Honey, I just walked in.
I'm exhausted.

1300
01:01:02,138 --> 01:01:04,618
Let me use this phone.

1301
01:01:04,674 --> 01:01:06,745
Where were you?

1302
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:08,949
We went to
the most beautiful restaurant.

1303
01:01:09,012 --> 01:01:11,720
Listen, I closed
a giant deal today.

1304
01:01:11,781 --> 01:01:13,260
Big deal.

1305
01:01:13,316 --> 01:01:15,023
Oh, really, dear?

1306
01:01:15,085 --> 01:01:18,032
It was fabulous.
It was fabulous!

1307
01:01:18,088 --> 01:01:20,864
I'll call you later, and you
can tell me all about it.

1308
01:01:20,924 --> 01:01:23,268
Let me tell you about it now.
You can't talk now?

1309
01:01:23,326 --> 01:01:24,771
Honey, I just walked in,

1310
01:01:24,828 --> 01:01:27,866
and I just--well, I'd like
to be able to concentrate.

1311
01:01:27,931 --> 01:01:30,036
OK. Forget it.
I'll tell you about it later.

1312
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,545
All right, dear.
Sleep well.

1313
01:01:31,601 --> 01:01:33,046
Good. Say hi to John.

1314
01:01:33,103 --> 01:01:34,548
All right.

1315
01:01:34,604 --> 01:01:35,674
OK. Bye.

1316
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:39,381
Your brother says hi.

1317
01:01:39,442 --> 01:01:40,716
Hi.

1318
01:01:40,777 --> 01:01:42,916
Want something to eat?

1319
01:01:42,979 --> 01:01:44,549
You got to be kidding.

1320
01:01:44,614 --> 01:01:46,059
You're not full?

1321
01:01:46,116 --> 01:01:49,461
What a wonderful time we had
this evening. Thank you, honey.

1322
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:51,055
It was fun.

1323
01:01:51,121 --> 01:01:54,568
As much as I don't want to,
I guess I'll go in my room

1324
01:01:54,624 --> 01:01:57,400
and see if I can work
a little bit.

1325
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:59,565
You don't feel silly
in that room, huh, dear?

1326
01:01:59,629 --> 01:02:01,267
I do a little bit, yeah.

1327
01:02:01,331 --> 01:02:03,538
And yet you still want
to be in there.

1328
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,544
Yeah.

1329
01:02:04,601 --> 01:02:06,410
I guess you know
what you're doing.

1330
01:02:06,469 --> 01:02:09,006
So, tomorrow I figure we'll
go shopping and have a nice lunch.

1331
01:02:09,072 --> 01:02:10,710
Oh, I can't do anything tomorrow.

1332
01:02:10,773 --> 01:02:11,717
Why not?

1333
01:02:11,774 --> 01:02:13,276
I have to take the car in.

1334
01:02:13,343 --> 01:02:14,651
What time is that?

1335
01:02:14,711 --> 01:02:15,849
9:00.

1336
01:02:15,912 --> 01:02:18,119
So how does that ruin
the whole day?

1337
01:02:18,181 --> 01:02:19,854
Oh, well, if there's
something wrong,

1338
01:02:19,916 --> 01:02:22,362
you know, they might
want me to leave it.

1339
01:02:22,418 --> 01:02:24,261
You never know what
they're going to say.

1340
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,357
What is wrong with the car?

1341
01:02:26,422 --> 01:02:28,629
It's some sort of a rattle.

1342
01:02:28,691 --> 01:02:30,193
I'll take a look at it.

1343
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:31,830
No, dear, I can't do that.

1344
01:02:31,895 --> 01:02:32,839
Why not?

1345
01:02:32,896 --> 01:02:34,842
You could void the warranty.

1346
01:02:34,898 --> 01:02:36,002
I could what?

1347
01:02:36,065 --> 01:02:39,046
They told me if I took it
to some other place

1348
01:02:39,102 --> 01:02:41,309
other than the dealer,
it would void the warranty.

1349
01:02:41,371 --> 01:02:42,941
Mother, I'm not another place.
I'm your child.

1350
01:02:43,006 --> 01:02:45,850
I don't have a waiting room
with magazines and a service adviser

1351
01:02:45,909 --> 01:02:48,355
who's going to tap you
on the shoulder and talk to you.

1352
01:02:48,411 --> 01:02:49,515
I'm your kid.

1353
01:02:49,579 --> 01:02:52,958
Honey, forget about it.
You could make it worse.

1354
01:02:59,756 --> 01:03:02,566
I can't get over how much
you know about cars.

1355
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:04,627
I just tightened the bolt
on the air cleaner.

1356
01:03:04,694 --> 01:03:06,867
I don't really know
anything about cars.

1357
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:08,068
It's wonderful, dear.

1358
01:03:08,131 --> 01:03:10,077
I'm sure they would
have found something

1359
01:03:10,133 --> 01:03:11,771
to charge me a fortune for.

1360
01:03:11,834 --> 01:03:14,337
It's so nice to have a man
around the house.

1361
01:03:14,404 --> 01:03:16,247
Dad used to fix stuff?

1362
01:03:16,306 --> 01:03:17,512
Oh, God, no.

1363
01:03:17,574 --> 01:03:20,521
I just always liked
that expression.

1364
01:03:31,854 --> 01:03:33,697
<i>Please take the ticket.</i>

1365
01:03:36,859 --> 01:03:38,133
Take that ticket.

1366
01:03:40,163 --> 01:03:41,642
Honey, I wonder--

1367
01:03:41,698 --> 01:03:44,611
Maybe--I don't know,
but we could park the car--

1368
01:03:44,667 --> 01:03:47,375
It's free. You don't even
have to have it validated.

1369
01:03:47,437 --> 01:03:48,780
Just take the ticket.

1370
01:03:48,838 --> 01:03:50,681
You don't have to
have it validated?

1371
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:54,449
Take the ticket!

1372
01:04:04,621 --> 01:04:07,534
My goodness, look what
they do at these places!

1373
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:09,069
You've never been here before?

1374
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:11,071
You know,
it's far from the house.

1375
01:04:11,127 --> 01:04:14,370
What am I going to do?
I'm not going to come here.

1376
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:16,068
It's 10 minutes from the house.

1377
01:04:16,132 --> 01:04:18,738
Oh. Well, it felt far.

1378
01:04:18,801 --> 01:04:20,371
There's a Gap up there.

1379
01:04:20,436 --> 01:04:22,643
Come on.
I need some underwear.

1380
01:04:29,812 --> 01:04:31,314
Yes, may I help you?

1381
01:04:31,381 --> 01:04:33,418
Yeah, I need to get
some underwear.

1382
01:04:33,483 --> 01:04:34,689
OK.

1383
01:04:34,751 --> 01:04:36,025
That's my son.

1384
01:04:36,085 --> 01:04:38,565
I didn't come here
to pick out underwear for him.

1385
01:04:38,621 --> 01:04:40,760
He's just staying with me
for a while.

1386
01:04:40,823 --> 01:04:42,825
Mother, I understand
when you tell your friends,

1387
01:04:42,892 --> 01:04:45,099
but this is a kid we don't
have to tell this to.

1388
01:04:45,161 --> 01:04:46,435
What is your name?

1389
01:04:46,496 --> 01:04:47,998
Steve.

1390
01:04:48,064 --> 01:04:49,634
Steve,
other than selling us things,

1391
01:04:49,699 --> 01:04:51,906
you don't give a shit
about us, do you?

1392
01:04:53,836 --> 01:04:55,509
No, not really.

1393
01:04:55,571 --> 01:04:57,278
See?

1394
01:04:58,675 --> 01:05:00,120
You tell everyone.

1395
01:05:00,176 --> 01:05:01,484
I don't tell everyone.

1396
01:05:01,544 --> 01:05:03,615
You do.
You don't even realize it.

1397
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,921
You're just trying to justify
everything to strangers.

1398
01:05:05,982 --> 01:05:07,791
That's not it at all, dear.

1399
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:10,888
People are just curious
why a grown man and his mother

1400
01:05:10,953 --> 01:05:12,557
would be in an underwear store.

1401
01:05:12,622 --> 01:05:14,033
Who cares if they're curious?

1402
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:15,592
What difference does it make?

1403
01:05:15,658 --> 01:05:17,103
You see what's going on?

1404
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,140
You want their approval,
I want your approval.

1405
01:05:19,195 --> 01:05:20,503
It's all about approval.

1406
01:05:20,563 --> 01:05:22,736
We have an approval problem
in this family.

1407
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:24,574
We don't have any problem
in this family,

1408
01:05:24,634 --> 01:05:25,977
and lower your voice.

1409
01:05:26,035 --> 01:05:28,072
You're making this
much too serious.

1410
01:05:28,137 --> 01:05:30,549
Now, where do you
want to go next?

1411
01:05:30,606 --> 01:05:32,176
Well, there's a little store

1412
01:05:32,241 --> 01:05:33,948
down there called
"Tell It All."

1413
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:37,389
You go in and tell them
your most personal secrets.

1414
01:05:37,447 --> 01:05:38,687
You're joking?

1415
01:05:38,748 --> 01:05:40,421
Yeah.

1416
01:05:40,483 --> 01:05:43,089
If only your writing
were that real.

1417
01:05:46,456 --> 01:05:48,766
Oh, look at this.

1418
01:05:48,825 --> 01:05:50,600
Oh!

1419
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:52,298
Hi!

1420
01:05:52,362 --> 01:05:53,864
Hi, cutie.

1421
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:55,603
Hi, cutie.

1422
01:05:55,665 --> 01:05:56,905
Yeah.

1423
01:05:56,966 --> 01:05:58,104
Honey, put that down.

1424
01:05:58,167 --> 01:05:59,510
Don't play with that.

1425
01:05:59,569 --> 01:06:01,742
Do you know
how much this dog is?

1426
01:06:01,804 --> 01:06:03,181
Mother, I'm just petting it.

1427
01:06:03,239 --> 01:06:05,276
I'm not Lennie
in Of Mice and Men.

1428
01:06:05,341 --> 01:06:07,116
What am I going to do,
kill it?

1429
01:06:07,176 --> 01:06:09,053
But, honey, look, it's over $3,000.
You don't want to--

1430
01:06:09,112 --> 01:06:10,523
Don't want to what?

1431
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:11,820
All right.

1432
01:06:11,881 --> 01:06:13,292
Do what you want.

1433
01:06:13,349 --> 01:06:15,295
Hello, cutie.

1434
01:06:16,486 --> 01:06:18,193
Hi, cutie.

1435
01:06:18,254 --> 01:06:21,167
Aw, yes, honey.

1436
01:06:21,224 --> 01:06:22,897
My son's in town
just for a while.

1437
01:06:22,959 --> 01:06:24,438
That's why we're shopping today.

1438
01:06:27,563 --> 01:06:30,407
Normally he doesn't live with me.

1439
01:06:30,466 --> 01:06:32,571
He's divorced.

1440
01:06:32,635 --> 01:06:36,549
Actually, it's his second divorce.

1441
01:06:38,074 --> 01:06:42,079
They just can't seem
to stay married anymore.

1442
01:06:42,145 --> 01:06:44,147
I don't know.

1443
01:06:45,448 --> 01:06:47,928
I can't believe that you
told him I was divorced.

1444
01:06:47,984 --> 01:06:49,292
Honey, he asked.

1445
01:06:49,352 --> 01:06:52,094
Oh, I'm sure he did.
That's what they do in these stores.

1446
01:06:52,155 --> 01:06:53,930
Before they can sell you a bird,

1447
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:55,594
they need to know
your marital status.

1448
01:06:55,658 --> 01:06:56,898
What difference does it make?

1449
01:06:56,959 --> 01:06:59,098
What if we were man and wife?

1450
01:06:59,162 --> 01:07:00,732
Shh! Honey, please!

1451
01:07:00,797 --> 01:07:03,607
Oh, Mother, I got to run
in here for one second.

1452
01:07:03,666 --> 01:07:06,670
I got to get a woman
something very quickly.

1453
01:07:06,736 --> 01:07:08,044
What, what?

1454
01:07:08,104 --> 01:07:10,380
You're going to get a woman
something in here?

1455
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,384
Yeah.

1456
01:07:11,441 --> 01:07:12,715
Who?

1457
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:25,722
Excuse me?

1458
01:07:25,788 --> 01:07:27,768
Welcome to Victoria's Secret.
May I help you?

1459
01:07:27,824 --> 01:07:30,202
Yes, I'm buying my mother
a pair of crotchless panties.

1460
01:07:30,259 --> 01:07:31,431
You're what?

1461
01:07:31,494 --> 01:07:33,770
Wonderful. Do you know
what size you are, ma'am?

1462
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:34,968
What size are you?

1463
01:07:35,031 --> 01:07:37,807
Uh, n-n-n-I'm--
No size. No--

1464
01:07:37,867 --> 01:07:40,177
He's just joking.
He's a writer.

1465
01:07:40,236 --> 01:07:41,772
It's all made up.
We're not getting anything.

1466
01:07:41,838 --> 01:07:44,079
We're getting out of here.
Thank you.

1467
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:45,585
She's shy. Sexy, but shy.

1468
01:07:45,641 --> 01:07:47,245
It's an experiment, you see?

1469
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:50,120
I'm part of an experiment...

1470
01:07:50,179 --> 01:07:52,853
Where we're things
that we're not.

1471
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:03,297
Remind me to call Jeff
when I get home.

1472
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:05,430
That's now the 30th time
you told me that.

1473
01:08:05,495 --> 01:08:06,872
I don't want to forget.

1474
01:08:06,929 --> 01:08:09,375
What are you so worried about?
What if you forgot?

1475
01:08:09,432 --> 01:08:11,036
That has nothing
to do with it.

1476
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:13,011
You know they want me
to come down there,

1477
01:08:13,069 --> 01:08:14,810
and they need to know
about the room.

1478
01:08:14,871 --> 01:08:16,214
Come down there? When?

1479
01:08:16,272 --> 01:08:17,945
I was going to go this weekend.

1480
01:08:18,007 --> 01:08:19,042
But I'm here.

1481
01:08:19,108 --> 01:08:20,678
You want to come with me?

1482
01:08:20,743 --> 01:08:22,484
No. I just came from there.

1483
01:08:22,545 --> 01:08:24,684
Mother, we need time alone.

1484
01:08:24,747 --> 01:08:26,055
We do?

1485
01:08:26,115 --> 01:08:28,220
Look, I don't want
to upset your life.

1486
01:08:28,284 --> 01:08:30,059
You do what you want to do.

1487
01:08:30,119 --> 01:08:31,894
You don't want to upset my life?

1488
01:08:31,954 --> 01:08:33,627
I thought that was part
of the experiment.

1489
01:08:33,689 --> 01:08:36,067
No, it's not part
of the experiment.

1490
01:08:36,125 --> 01:08:37,570
Go visit Jeff.

1491
01:08:37,627 --> 01:08:39,573
No. I'll stay with you.

1492
01:08:39,629 --> 01:08:42,542
Are you sure that's
what you want to do?

1493
01:08:42,598 --> 01:08:46,239
No, dear, I'm not,
but I'll stay.

1494
01:08:48,304 --> 01:08:51,148
Well, Christ, Mom,
we're all expecting you.

1495
01:08:51,207 --> 01:08:52,914
You can't just do that.

1496
01:08:52,975 --> 01:08:54,977
Well, it's just that John is here.

1497
01:08:55,044 --> 01:08:56,751
And let me get through with him,

1498
01:08:56,812 --> 01:08:58,314
and then I'll come down there.

1499
01:08:58,381 --> 01:09:00,088
But how long will that be?

1500
01:09:00,149 --> 01:09:01,594
I don't know, honey.

1501
01:09:01,651 --> 01:09:03,096
He doesn't tell me.

1502
01:09:03,152 --> 01:09:04,995
What's going on?

1503
01:09:05,054 --> 01:09:06,397
That's great.

1504
01:09:06,455 --> 01:09:08,731
You know, somebody could have
told us before, Mother.

1505
01:09:08,791 --> 01:09:09,735
We had plans.

1506
01:09:09,792 --> 01:09:12,033
What's the problem?

1507
01:09:12,094 --> 01:09:14,074
I should be asking you that.

1508
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:16,201
We are planned.
Now she's not coming.

1509
01:09:16,265 --> 01:09:17,437
You know what?

1510
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,502
You talk to her
every goddamned day of your life.

1511
01:09:19,569 --> 01:09:21,071
Can I have this
little bit of time?

1512
01:09:21,137 --> 01:09:23,879
I don't talk to her every
goddamned day of anybody's life,

1513
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:26,045
and you can do whatever you want.

1514
01:09:26,108 --> 01:09:28,384
Get some help, buddy!

1515
01:09:29,645 --> 01:09:31,215
Hey!

1516
01:09:46,462 --> 01:09:48,601
Watch it, will you?

1517
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:51,574
What's the matter with you?

1518
01:09:51,634 --> 01:09:53,636
My mother's not coming here
this weekend.

1519
01:09:53,703 --> 01:09:54,909
Where's she going?

1520
01:09:54,971 --> 01:09:56,746
She's staying
up there with John.

1521
01:09:56,806 --> 01:09:58,410
So that's OK, isn't it?

1522
01:09:58,474 --> 01:10:00,283
We had a plan, didn't we?

1523
01:10:00,343 --> 01:10:02,186
She was going to come down here.

1524
01:10:02,244 --> 01:10:04,246
We were going to do something
with the kids. Yes?

1525
01:10:04,313 --> 01:10:06,919
Yes. We can't do something
with the kids?

1526
01:10:06,983 --> 01:10:08,394
That's not the point.

1527
01:10:08,451 --> 01:10:10,192
No, that is the point.

1528
01:10:10,252 --> 01:10:12,254
It's almost like
you're not going to live

1529
01:10:12,321 --> 01:10:13,629
unless your mother comes here.

1530
01:10:13,689 --> 01:10:15,430
I like to be with my mother.

1531
01:10:15,491 --> 01:10:17,198
Is there something wrong
with that?

1532
01:10:17,259 --> 01:10:19,034
I mean, just because
I get along with mine.

1533
01:10:19,095 --> 01:10:20,438
Oh, go to hell.

1534
01:10:20,496 --> 01:10:22,806
I'm tired of this,
and there's a big difference

1535
01:10:22,865 --> 01:10:25,539
between getting along with
and not being able to live without.

1536
01:10:25,601 --> 01:10:26,875
What does that mean?

1537
01:10:26,936 --> 01:10:28,711
It means you're a mama's boy.

1538
01:10:28,771 --> 01:10:30,250
Screw you!

1539
01:10:32,141 --> 01:10:33,848
I'm not a mama's boy.

1540
01:10:33,909 --> 01:10:35,547
I love my mother.

1541
01:10:35,611 --> 01:10:37,557
What's wrong with that?

1542
01:10:37,613 --> 01:10:40,184
How do you think
that makes me feel?

1543
01:10:40,249 --> 01:10:42,559
You find out that your mother's
not coming here,

1544
01:10:42,618 --> 01:10:44,063
and your world ends.

1545
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:46,566
I don't mean anything,
the kids don't mean anything.

1546
01:10:46,622 --> 01:10:49,228
Don't you think that's
a little odd at your age?

1547
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:50,998
What are you afraid of?

1548
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:53,734
I am not afraid of anything.

1549
01:10:53,796 --> 01:10:56,436
What does that mean?

1550
01:10:56,499 --> 01:10:58,035
Your brother went up there

1551
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:00,307
to figure out his relationship
with his mother.

1552
01:11:00,369 --> 01:11:02,576
I think you'd better
do the same thing.

1553
01:11:02,638 --> 01:11:05,585
My relationship with my mother
is perfect. I don't have his problem.

1554
01:11:05,641 --> 01:11:07,086
Don't be too sure.

1555
01:11:07,143 --> 01:11:09,953
I don't think you know your mother
any better than he does.

1556
01:11:10,012 --> 01:11:11,423
You just cling more.

1557
01:11:21,357 --> 01:11:25,271
They say that these animals
have better memory than even us.

1558
01:11:25,327 --> 01:11:27,364
We don't have
that good of a memory.

1559
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:29,535
I don't think animals
get Alzheimer's.

1560
01:11:29,598 --> 01:11:30,941
Hmm.

1561
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,640
You know,
I once read about that.

1562
01:11:33,703 --> 01:11:35,546
What did I read?

1563
01:11:35,604 --> 01:11:37,345
It was-- I'm thinking.

1564
01:11:37,406 --> 01:11:40,216
I think you've just
proved the point.

1565
01:11:40,276 --> 01:11:42,756
Now, let's see
if this animal remembers me.

1566
01:11:42,812 --> 01:11:45,349
That's the same elephant
as when I was a kid.

1567
01:11:45,414 --> 01:11:46,654
How do you know?

1568
01:11:46,716 --> 01:11:47,922
Look at his rear.

1569
01:11:47,983 --> 01:11:49,189
The white diamond.

1570
01:11:49,251 --> 01:11:50,195
Remember?

1571
01:11:50,252 --> 01:11:51,560
That's the same animal.

1572
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:53,293
Now, we came here a lot, right?

1573
01:11:53,355 --> 01:11:55,699
We came here dozens of times.
Call him.

1574
01:11:55,758 --> 01:11:57,704
Hey?

1575
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,001
Fatty!

1576
01:12:01,097 --> 01:12:03,737
It's John and his mother.

1577
01:12:03,799 --> 01:12:07,440
Remember we fed you a lot?

1578
01:12:07,503 --> 01:12:08,846
Remember?

1579
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,519
No, he's walking away.

1580
01:12:12,575 --> 01:12:14,384
I guess he doesn't
remember me, huh?

1581
01:12:14,443 --> 01:12:17,822
He might remember you.
He might not like you.

1582
01:12:20,583 --> 01:12:22,654
Honey, I don't need this.

1583
01:12:22,718 --> 01:12:25,358
Mother, nobody needs a T-shirt
with their name on it.

1584
01:12:25,421 --> 01:12:27,367
We're getting it just for fun.

1585
01:12:27,423 --> 01:12:28,731
These people--

1586
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:29,895
Uh-uh-uh.

1587
01:12:29,959 --> 01:12:31,302
You're right.

1588
01:12:33,195 --> 01:12:35,937
That looks perfect. Thanks.

1589
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:39,142
Look at this.

1590
01:12:39,201 --> 01:12:41,306
I am very proud of you.

1591
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:42,508
Why?

1592
01:12:42,571 --> 01:12:45,051
You know why.
This was a big step.

1593
01:12:45,107 --> 01:12:47,212
You didn't make any explanation,
no apologies.

1594
01:12:47,276 --> 01:12:49,051
Now I think we should graduate

1595
01:12:49,111 --> 01:12:51,455
and go on to something
far more embarrassing.

1596
01:12:51,514 --> 01:12:55,121
There's a nude beach nearby,
but it's not very nice out.

1597
01:12:55,184 --> 01:12:56,925
That's...a joke?

1598
01:12:56,986 --> 01:12:59,398
You think I'd go
to a nude beach?

1599
01:12:59,455 --> 01:13:01,492
Very good, Mother.

1600
01:13:01,557 --> 01:13:03,833
Mother, stop sign
coming up right here.

1601
01:13:03,893 --> 01:13:05,167
Stop sign.

1602
01:13:05,227 --> 01:13:06,831
Stop sign!
What are you doing?

1603
01:13:06,896 --> 01:13:08,068
Where?

1604
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:09,700
Where?!
All right, that's it.

1605
01:13:09,765 --> 01:13:11,369
Hold the penguin.
I'm driving.

1606
01:13:18,374 --> 01:13:20,081
Well, look who's here.

1607
01:13:20,142 --> 01:13:21,917
Jeff, honey!

1608
01:13:21,977 --> 01:13:23,581
What you got there?

1609
01:13:23,646 --> 01:13:26,092
Well, we just came home from the zoo.
Anything wrong?

1610
01:13:26,148 --> 01:13:27,593
No, no. Nothing at all.

1611
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:29,425
I was just up here on business.

1612
01:13:29,485 --> 01:13:31,260
I thought I'd drop by
and say hello.

1613
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:32,264
Come on in.

1614
01:13:32,321 --> 01:13:33,265
Hey.

1615
01:13:34,924 --> 01:13:36,665
Honey, I like your suit.

1616
01:13:36,725 --> 01:13:38,762
You don't think
it's too long, do you?

1617
01:13:38,828 --> 01:13:39,772
Oh, no.

1618
01:13:39,829 --> 01:13:41,502
No, look at it.

1619
01:13:41,564 --> 01:13:43,407
Business, huh?
Came up here on business?

1620
01:13:43,465 --> 01:13:44,569
Who's up here?

1621
01:13:44,633 --> 01:13:45,941
What does that mean?

1622
01:13:46,001 --> 01:13:48,811
I mean, who do you represent
that lives in the Bay Area?

1623
01:13:48,871 --> 01:13:51,044
If you knew anything about sports,
there's about 6 teams up here,

1624
01:13:51,106 --> 01:13:53,086
so I don't want
to talk about it, OK?

1625
01:13:53,142 --> 01:13:54,644
What should I make to eat?

1626
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:56,053
You still have that sherbet?

1627
01:13:56,111 --> 01:13:58,113
Absolutely.

1628
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:01,024
OK. Just a bowl of that and some of
that cheese if you have that, too.

1629
01:14:01,083 --> 01:14:02,153
Good, good.

1630
01:14:02,218 --> 01:14:03,822
You like her food?

1631
01:14:03,886 --> 01:14:05,524
Huh?

1632
01:14:05,588 --> 01:14:07,124
Nothing.

1633
01:14:07,189 --> 01:14:09,965
So, Jeff, everything
all right with you?

1634
01:14:10,025 --> 01:14:11,402
Yeah, everything's all right.

1635
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:13,963
Look, could I speak to John
alone for a second?

1636
01:14:14,029 --> 01:14:17,067
Of course, honey.
John, show him your room.

1637
01:14:17,132 --> 01:14:18,509
Ha ha!

1638
01:14:18,567 --> 01:14:20,979
Yeah, show me your room.

1639
01:14:21,036 --> 01:14:23,573
Let's see that room
of yours, John.

1640
01:14:23,639 --> 01:14:25,243
No cheese for me.

1641
01:14:30,412 --> 01:14:31,447
Oh!

1642
01:14:33,415 --> 01:14:35,088
Pretty cool, huh?

1643
01:14:35,150 --> 01:14:37,562
Oh, boy!

1644
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:40,100
Look...

1645
01:14:40,155 --> 01:14:42,761
Don't take this the wrong way,

1646
01:14:42,825 --> 01:14:45,271
but I think this is tragic.

1647
01:14:45,327 --> 01:14:47,603
Oh, man, who asked you?

1648
01:14:47,663 --> 01:14:51,201
I--I--I don't think Mother
has anything to do with your problem.

1649
01:14:51,267 --> 01:14:52,507
Look who's talking.

1650
01:14:52,568 --> 01:14:54,479
Look who immediately
got on an airplane

1651
01:14:54,536 --> 01:14:56,607
because Mommy couldn't listen
to the good news.

1652
01:14:56,672 --> 01:14:58,117
What the hell are you doing here?

1653
01:14:58,173 --> 01:15:01,279
I'm here on business. I told you
I'm on the way to the airport.

1654
01:15:01,343 --> 01:15:02,617
Stop bullshitting yourself.

1655
01:15:02,678 --> 01:15:04,783
You don't have any business here.
You missed Mommy.

1656
01:15:04,847 --> 01:15:07,453
Listen, I don't make a living
in a room all day like you, OK?

1657
01:15:07,516 --> 01:15:08,824
I travel all the time.

1658
01:15:08,884 --> 01:15:11,455
Please do not tell me
what my business consists of.

1659
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,897
I think you're kidding yourself,

1660
01:15:12,955 --> 01:15:14,491
and I think you ought to
examine this.

1661
01:15:14,556 --> 01:15:16,627
Don't tell me what to examine.
I have a very nice family.

1662
01:15:16,692 --> 01:15:18,569
I think
I'm pretty well adjusted.

1663
01:15:18,627 --> 01:15:20,629
Whatever.

1664
01:15:20,696 --> 01:15:25,577
Anyway, I'd like Mom to come down
this weekend and see the kids.

1665
01:15:25,634 --> 01:15:27,443
So it's no big deal,
really, is it?

1666
01:15:27,503 --> 01:15:29,005
Yeah, it's a big deal.

1667
01:15:29,071 --> 01:15:31,449
She already told you
she's staying here with me.

1668
01:15:31,507 --> 01:15:32,850
Why can't you understand that?

1669
01:15:32,908 --> 01:15:34,751
And whose idea was that,
yours or hers?

1670
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:36,915
Oh, I'm telling her
what to say now?

1671
01:15:36,979 --> 01:15:39,425
I have children. Do you understand?
They'll be disappointed.

1672
01:15:39,481 --> 01:15:41,085
They want to see
their grandmother.

1673
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:44,427
Whatever it is that you're doing here,
and God only knows--

1674
01:15:44,486 --> 01:15:48,024
I mean, can't it hold for 2 days?
She'll be back.

1675
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:50,092
Robot to earthling.

1676
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:52,002
Mommy not coming with you.

1677
01:15:52,061 --> 01:15:53,438
Mommy staying here,

1678
01:15:53,495 --> 01:15:54,473
Robot to earthling.

1679
01:15:54,530 --> 01:15:55,508
Ow!

1680
01:15:55,564 --> 01:15:58,875
All right,
let's see whose idea it was.

1681
01:15:58,934 --> 01:15:59,935
Ow!

1682
01:16:02,438 --> 01:16:04,941
Mom, if you can
get away for 3 days--

1683
01:16:05,007 --> 01:16:07,954
I mean, the kids, you know,
they would love to see you.

1684
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:09,546
Mother, you've already
made this decision.

1685
01:16:09,611 --> 01:16:11,420
You don't have
to make it again.

1686
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,084
Now, don't let him
intimidate you.

1687
01:16:13,148 --> 01:16:14,559
Honey,
nobody intimidates me.

1688
01:16:14,616 --> 01:16:17,062
Dear, I'm going to stay up here
for a little while,

1689
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:19,497
and when I'm through I'll
come down and see everybody.

1690
01:16:19,555 --> 01:16:21,501
Fine. I'll just tell the kids
you're not coming.

1691
01:16:21,557 --> 01:16:23,468
Oh, I forgot about the kids.

1692
01:16:23,525 --> 01:16:24,902
Look what he's doing.

1693
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,065
What makes you think the kids
want to see you, anyway?

1694
01:16:27,129 --> 01:16:28,665
Don't you think they'd rather
be outside playing?

1695
01:16:28,731 --> 01:16:30,404
You know,
I always thought that.

1696
01:16:30,466 --> 01:16:32,707
I always thought
they stayed indoors for me.

1697
01:16:32,768 --> 01:16:34,076
Is that right, Jeff?

1698
01:16:34,136 --> 01:16:36,241
Mother, don't be silly.
Don't listen to him.

1699
01:16:36,305 --> 01:16:38,717
That's right. That's what
I liked to do when I was a kid.

1700
01:16:38,774 --> 01:16:40,913
Stay inside in a darkened room
with my grandmother.

1701
01:16:40,976 --> 01:16:42,580
I don't need
this sarcastic shit.

1702
01:16:42,644 --> 01:16:45,147
You don't want to come,
don't come. It's OK. Fine.

1703
01:16:45,214 --> 01:16:46,192
Bye-bye.

1704
01:16:46,248 --> 01:16:47,192
Bye.

1705
01:16:47,249 --> 01:16:48,660
Oh, I feel terrible.

1706
01:16:48,717 --> 01:16:49,855
He succeeded now.

1707
01:16:49,918 --> 01:16:51,659
See what he's doing to you?

1708
01:16:54,223 --> 01:16:55,759
Honey, don't leave like this.

1709
01:16:55,824 --> 01:16:57,770
Really. It's nothing.

1710
01:16:57,826 --> 01:16:59,169
Then come with me.

1711
01:16:59,228 --> 01:17:01,731
"Then come with me." My God,
it sounds like you're lovers.

1712
01:17:01,797 --> 01:17:03,071
We're lovers?!

1713
01:17:03,132 --> 01:17:04,611
You're the one
that's living with her!

1714
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:06,304
Well,
I have some news for you.

1715
01:17:06,368 --> 01:17:07,972
We are lovers.

1716
01:17:10,806 --> 01:17:12,046
That's a joke?

1717
01:17:12,107 --> 01:17:13,552
No, it isn't a joke.

1718
01:17:13,609 --> 01:17:15,850
I didn't want to tell you earlier.
I thought it would upset you.

1719
01:17:15,911 --> 01:17:16,912
No. God! Um--

1720
01:17:16,979 --> 01:17:18,458
Why are you talking like this?

1721
01:17:18,514 --> 01:17:21,051
Why would you even say something
like that? It's disgusting.

1722
01:17:21,116 --> 01:17:23,027
Why is it disgusting?
Don't you read history?

1723
01:17:23,085 --> 01:17:24,393
It didn't start with me.

1724
01:17:24,453 --> 01:17:26,433
I love my mother,
and I love having sex with her.

1725
01:17:26,488 --> 01:17:27,489
Oh, my God!

1726
01:17:28,657 --> 01:17:30,398
You ought to examine yourself
that you could

1727
01:17:30,459 --> 01:17:31,938
even make a joke like that.

1728
01:17:31,994 --> 01:17:34,736
Well, you ought to examine yourself
that you take it so seriously.

1729
01:17:34,797 --> 01:17:36,071
Shh!

1730
01:17:36,131 --> 01:17:38,577
By the way, you make so much fun
of the picture phones,

1731
01:17:38,634 --> 01:17:40,614
why don't you send the one
I gave you back, OK?

1732
01:17:40,669 --> 01:17:43,343
It's still in the box. Take it.
I don't give a crap.

1733
01:17:43,405 --> 01:17:45,783
Keep it.
I get them for free, anyway.

1734
01:17:47,476 --> 01:17:49,717
Free?

1735
01:17:49,778 --> 01:17:52,520
I told you. Some gift, huh?

1736
01:18:04,927 --> 01:18:08,500
But nothing happened
out of the ordinary?

1737
01:18:09,631 --> 01:18:10,666
Uh-huh.

1738
01:18:10,732 --> 01:18:12,541
No, no.
He just seemed so upset.

1739
01:18:12,601 --> 01:18:14,547
They were having this argument,

1740
01:18:14,603 --> 01:18:16,879
and he stormed out of the house.

1741
01:18:16,939 --> 01:18:18,350
I mean, really, it was--

1742
01:18:18,407 --> 01:18:20,045
Hmm?

1743
01:18:20,109 --> 01:18:21,486
Oh, now, dear.

1744
01:18:21,543 --> 01:18:24,046
Don't be upset about it, dear.

1745
01:18:24,113 --> 01:18:26,059
No. It happens to everybody.

1746
01:18:26,115 --> 01:18:27,890
If you want to,
you can call me later.

1747
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:29,054
Yeah.

1748
01:18:29,118 --> 01:18:30,563
All right, honey.

1749
01:18:30,619 --> 01:18:32,223
Good-bye, honey.

1750
01:18:32,287 --> 01:18:33,732
Who was that?

1751
01:18:33,789 --> 01:18:34,893
Cheryl.

1752
01:18:34,957 --> 01:18:36,561
I have a theory
about this whole thing.

1753
01:18:36,625 --> 01:18:38,229
Do you want to hear it?

1754
01:18:38,293 --> 01:18:39,601
What is it?

1755
01:18:39,661 --> 01:18:42,904
Well, the so-called adjusted one
is actually the sickle,

1756
01:18:42,965 --> 01:18:46,071
and the one who
everyone thinks is sick

1757
01:18:46,135 --> 01:18:49,514
is pretty dam healthy
to begin with.

1758
01:18:49,571 --> 01:18:51,573
Which one are you?

1759
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:54,120
Hey, tomorrow at 11:00--

1760
01:18:54,176 --> 01:18:56,622
Oh, honey, I can't do anything
with you tomorrow.

1761
01:18:56,678 --> 01:18:57,918
Why?

1762
01:18:57,980 --> 01:18:59,584
Don't ask me any questions.

1763
01:18:59,648 --> 01:19:01,252
I have something to do.

1764
01:19:01,316 --> 01:19:03,091
Do you work for the C.I.A.?

1765
01:19:03,152 --> 01:19:04,426
What are you doing?

1766
01:19:04,486 --> 01:19:07,092
I hate to talk about
every single thing.

1767
01:19:07,156 --> 01:19:10,035
You're secretly going down
to Jeff's, aren't you?

1768
01:19:10,092 --> 01:19:13,539
I have a friend who I see
every 3 or 4 weeks

1769
01:19:13,595 --> 01:19:15,541
when he comes
through San Francisco,

1770
01:19:15,597 --> 01:19:16,701
and he's coming.

1771
01:19:16,765 --> 01:19:19,371
Normally, we spend
a couple of days together,

1772
01:19:19,434 --> 01:19:22,438
but I told him, because you
were here, just one day.

1773
01:19:22,504 --> 01:19:26,042
Well, first of all,
I'm really upset because I told you

1774
01:19:26,108 --> 01:19:28,884
not to alter your life
because of me.

1775
01:19:28,944 --> 01:19:31,652
I'm not having somebody stay
in the house when you're here.

1776
01:19:31,713 --> 01:19:33,886
He stays over?

1777
01:19:35,450 --> 01:19:38,488
Well, not really.

1778
01:19:38,554 --> 01:19:39,828
Not really?

1779
01:19:42,457 --> 01:19:44,733
Well, do you want me
to go to a hotel?

1780
01:19:44,793 --> 01:19:46,397
That's a waste of money.

1781
01:19:46,461 --> 01:19:47,906
Which hotel?

1782
01:19:47,963 --> 01:19:49,738
I don't want to go to a hotel.

1783
01:19:49,798 --> 01:19:51,573
I want to stay in my room.

1784
01:19:51,633 --> 01:19:52,907
I know, honey.

1785
01:19:52,968 --> 01:19:54,914
That's why he's not
staying over this time.

1786
01:19:54,970 --> 01:19:56,415
But I do have to see him.

1787
01:19:56,471 --> 01:19:57,677
What's his name?

1788
01:19:57,739 --> 01:19:59,719
Charles.

1789
01:19:59,775 --> 01:20:03,484
I'm curious-- why have I never
heard of this man before?

1790
01:20:03,545 --> 01:20:05,081
I don't tell you everything.

1791
01:20:05,147 --> 01:20:06,421
It's not that important.

1792
01:20:06,481 --> 01:20:07,687
Not that important?

1793
01:20:07,749 --> 01:20:09,023
Gee, Mother, I would think

1794
01:20:09,084 --> 01:20:12,122
a man that you're intimate with
is pretty important.

1795
01:20:12,187 --> 01:20:14,861
Dear, we're not intimate.

1796
01:20:14,923 --> 01:20:17,665
We just have sex occasionally.

1797
01:20:17,726 --> 01:20:19,205
Oh...

1798
01:20:19,261 --> 01:20:20,865
I mean, oh.

1799
01:20:25,901 --> 01:20:28,177
Oh, hello.

1800
01:20:28,237 --> 01:20:29,875
You must be Charles.

1801
01:20:29,938 --> 01:20:31,884
You must be the other son.

1802
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:33,544
Are you still blocked?

1803
01:20:33,609 --> 01:20:34,713
Still blocked?

1804
01:20:34,776 --> 01:20:36,380
Yeah.
Word travels, doesn't it?

1805
01:20:36,445 --> 01:20:38,083
I've heard an awful lot
about you.

1806
01:20:38,146 --> 01:20:39,887
Your mother's very proud of you.

1807
01:20:39,948 --> 01:20:41,894
I thought you had
the wrong address.

1808
01:20:41,950 --> 01:20:43,224
Now I'm positive.

1809
01:20:43,285 --> 01:20:45,060
You should hear her
talk about you.

1810
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,565
I have.
That's why I'm here.

1811
01:20:46,622 --> 01:20:48,568
When you're not here,
she brags her head off.

1812
01:20:48,624 --> 01:20:49,932
What does she do?

1813
01:20:49,992 --> 01:20:53,064
Marvel that I can get all
of my fat under my clothes?

1814
01:20:53,128 --> 01:20:55,130
No, I haven't heard that one.
How do you do that?

1815
01:20:55,197 --> 01:20:56,574
Oh, there she is.

1816
01:20:56,632 --> 01:20:57,906
I see you've met.

1817
01:20:57,966 --> 01:20:59,912
What are you two talking about?

1818
01:20:59,968 --> 01:21:02,244
Just the whole damn thing,
that's all.

1819
01:21:02,304 --> 01:21:04,580
Honey, don't
bother him with the experiment.

1820
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:05,584
He'll never understand.

1821
01:21:05,641 --> 01:21:07,143
I didn't say anything.

1822
01:21:07,209 --> 01:21:08,688
He's not like us.

1823
01:21:08,744 --> 01:21:10,246
I didn't tell anything.

1824
01:21:10,312 --> 01:21:13,054
All right, I'm ready to go.

1825
01:21:13,115 --> 01:21:15,288
Honey, there's some food
in the refrigerator.

1826
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:17,352
Mother, you promised.
No more food talk.

1827
01:21:17,419 --> 01:21:19,524
All right, dear.

1828
01:21:21,089 --> 01:21:24,366
Be asleep when we get home.

1829
01:21:25,927 --> 01:21:28,533
You have that food problem, too?

1830
01:21:40,609 --> 01:21:43,556
So he didn't want to
stay in a hotel.

1831
01:21:43,612 --> 01:21:45,888
Let's not let that
ruin our evening.

1832
01:21:45,947 --> 01:21:47,551
Oh, it's not ruining anything.

1833
01:21:47,616 --> 01:21:51,063
By the way,
for later on, I, uh...

1834
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:53,065
I rented that movie.

1835
01:21:53,121 --> 01:21:55,567
Oh, we're not watching any movies.
No, no, no.

1836
01:21:55,624 --> 01:21:57,228
You'll just drop me off.

1837
01:21:57,292 --> 01:21:58,566
What?

1838
01:21:58,627 --> 01:22:00,573
This is not the time for that.

1839
01:22:00,629 --> 01:22:03,075
When he goes back to Los Angeles,
you'll show me.

1840
01:22:03,131 --> 01:22:05,236
I don't want to wait that long.

1841
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:06,574
When is he going back?

1842
01:22:06,635 --> 01:22:08,342
I don't know, but no movies--
not tonight.

1843
01:22:08,403 --> 01:22:09,507
Now, please.

1844
01:22:09,571 --> 01:22:11,517
Beatrice, I'm sorry,
but I don't understand.

1845
01:22:11,573 --> 01:22:12,847
Well, think about it.

1846
01:22:12,908 --> 01:22:16,014
I have a 40-year-old man
20 feet away,

1847
01:22:16,078 --> 01:22:18,684
and I don't feel very private.

1848
01:22:18,747 --> 01:22:21,523
Wasn't that
one of your fantasies?

1849
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:26,191
A 40-year-old man...
20 feet away...

1850
01:22:26,254 --> 01:22:29,531
No. That was a 60-year-old man
6 feet under.

1851
01:22:29,591 --> 01:22:31,696
Now I'm warning you,
he's my son,

1852
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,206
and I don't want
to talk about it.

1853
01:22:34,262 --> 01:22:35,366
All right.

1854
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:37,376
Let's just have a nice dinner,

1855
01:22:37,432 --> 01:22:39,207
and then maybe later
you'll change your mind.

1856
01:22:39,267 --> 01:22:40,712
I'm not going to change my mind.

1857
01:22:40,769 --> 01:22:43,215
No movies, no nothing,
until he goes home.

1858
01:22:43,271 --> 01:22:46,047
Well, we can talk about it
in the car, can't we?

1859
01:22:46,108 --> 01:22:48,054
That's a silly place
to talk about it.

1860
01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:51,387
God forbid,
what if we got pulled over?

1861
01:22:51,446 --> 01:22:54,893
I think you're thinking
of dirty underwear.

1862
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:57,226
They don't know what
you're talking about.

1863
01:22:57,285 --> 01:22:59,561
Oh, don't be too sure.

1864
01:22:59,621 --> 01:23:01,897
When they point
those things at you,

1865
01:23:01,957 --> 01:23:04,403
I just wonder
what they really know.

1866
01:23:15,504 --> 01:23:17,074
<i>...beef jerky,</i>

1867
01:23:17,139 --> 01:23:20,086
<i>just marinate in a combination
of soy sauce and brown sugar.</i>

1868
01:23:20,142 --> 01:23:22,918
<i>Place the meat on the trays,
you plug it in,</i>

1869
01:23:22,978 --> 01:23:26,892
<i>and that's all there is
to making beef jerky.</i>

1870
01:23:26,948 --> 01:23:28,928
<i>I learned technique.</i>

1871
01:23:28,984 --> 01:23:31,260
<i>That's why I wrote
the Warner book, Technique.</i>

1872
01:23:31,319 --> 01:23:33,265
<i>Take a look at Paul Avaloni.</i>

1873
01:23:33,321 --> 01:23:35,267
<i>Look at him-- 60-inch waist.</i>

1874
01:23:35,323 --> 01:23:38,099
<i>Look at this.
That's what we're talking about.</i>

1875
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:39,798
<i>Right?</i>

1876
01:23:39,861 --> 01:23:42,603
<i>Look at this. Really fine.</i>

1877
01:23:42,664 --> 01:23:44,575
<i>This is perfect.</i>

1878
01:23:44,633 --> 01:23:46,112
<i>So many recipes
call for chopped onion.</i>

1879
01:23:46,168 --> 01:23:47,613
<i>That's right,
and Mexican food--</i>

1880
01:23:47,669 --> 01:23:49,148
<i>Oh, I love Mexican food.</i>

1881
01:23:49,204 --> 01:23:51,946
<i>But watch how it works, ladies.</i>

1882
01:23:52,007 --> 01:23:53,611
<i>We're ready. This is great.</i>

1883
01:23:53,675 --> 01:23:55,586
<i>We've seen this once.</i>

1884
01:23:55,644 --> 01:23:57,624
<i>Look at the smile on Ari's face.</i>

1885
01:23:57,679 --> 01:23:59,625
<i>Now, Ron, you're about
3 inches from his scalp--</i>

1886
01:23:59,681 --> 01:24:01,126
<i>That's all you do.</i>

1887
01:24:01,183 --> 01:24:02,457
<i>And you're just spraying it,</i>

1888
01:24:02,517 --> 01:24:04,463
<i>like you would
a bottle of hairspray.</i>

1889
01:24:04,519 --> 01:24:05,827
<i>It's as simple as that.</i>

1890
01:25:24,799 --> 01:25:27,803
"Jeanette's Secret Locket"

1891
01:25:44,653 --> 01:25:47,099
"As I turned the corner
on main street,

1892
01:25:47,155 --> 01:25:50,432
the sun was shining
right behind me."

1893
01:25:54,162 --> 01:25:56,506
"Princess Anna"

1894
01:26:05,006 --> 01:26:07,885
"Irene Takes a Lover"

1895
01:26:14,282 --> 01:26:16,888
"The room was dark
except for the slash of light

1896
01:26:16,952 --> 01:26:18,454
that peeked through the curtains.

1897
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:22,058
Irene dreaded going home.

1898
01:26:22,123 --> 01:26:23,727
The darkness of the house

1899
01:26:23,792 --> 01:26:25,794
equaled the darkness
of her marriage."

1900
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:28,067
This looks good.

1901
01:26:28,129 --> 01:26:30,575
Unbelievable.

1902
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:41,416
Ha ha ha!

1903
01:27:08,103 --> 01:27:09,207
Please?

1904
01:27:09,270 --> 01:27:10,374
Shh.

1905
01:27:10,438 --> 01:27:12,042
No, I'm just saying please.

1906
01:27:12,107 --> 01:27:13,381
Don't beg-- not here.

1907
01:27:13,441 --> 01:27:14,715
What if he's asleep already?

1908
01:27:14,776 --> 01:27:16,221
You said he's
a very sound sleeper.

1909
01:27:16,277 --> 01:27:18,382
That's Jeff. I don't think
this one ever sleeps.

1910
01:27:18,446 --> 01:27:20,221
Why don't we just
go in and see,

1911
01:27:20,281 --> 01:27:22,056
and then if he's up,
I'll leave.

1912
01:27:22,117 --> 01:27:23,721
Well, all right.

1913
01:27:36,564 --> 01:27:37,565
John?

1914
01:27:37,632 --> 01:27:39,077
Oh, hi.

1915
01:27:39,134 --> 01:27:40,579
What are you doing?

1916
01:27:40,635 --> 01:27:42,080
What do you mean?

1917
01:27:42,137 --> 01:27:44,083
Why do you have
all this stuff out?

1918
01:27:44,139 --> 01:27:46,449
Well, I'm just looking at it.

1919
01:27:46,508 --> 01:27:48,579
Well, who told you
you could do that?

1920
01:27:48,643 --> 01:27:49,917
That's mine.

1921
01:27:49,978 --> 01:27:51,582
Who told you to do that?

1922
01:27:51,646 --> 01:27:54,092
What right have you got
to touch my stuff?

1923
01:27:54,149 --> 01:27:55,423
Mother, take it easy.

1924
01:27:55,483 --> 01:27:57,588
I just saw the boxes
in the closet.

1925
01:27:57,652 --> 01:27:59,757
Mother?

1926
01:28:01,656 --> 01:28:04,603
I'll call you later.
I need to talk to John.

1927
01:28:04,659 --> 01:28:06,605
Are you sure?
I thought maybe--

1928
01:28:06,661 --> 01:28:07,696
That's it.

1929
01:28:09,597 --> 01:28:10,701
Good night.

1930
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:13,704
Good night.

1931
01:28:13,768 --> 01:28:14,872
Good night.

1932
01:28:21,109 --> 01:28:23,055
I am very upset with you,
really.

1933
01:28:23,111 --> 01:28:25,057
I don't rummage
through your stuff.

1934
01:28:25,113 --> 01:28:27,218
I didn't do anything.
What's the big deal?

1935
01:28:27,282 --> 01:28:29,057
What have you got to hide?

1936
01:28:29,117 --> 01:28:30,562
I have nothing to hide.

1937
01:28:30,618 --> 01:28:32,564
These boxes are put away
for a reason.

1938
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:33,724
What reason?

1939
01:28:33,788 --> 01:28:35,062
My reason.

1940
01:28:35,123 --> 01:28:37,569
All right,
I'm putting it all away.

1941
01:28:39,794 --> 01:28:41,034
Mother...

1942
01:28:42,630 --> 01:28:43,734
Mother?

1943
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:53,915
Did you write all that stuff?

1944
01:28:53,975 --> 01:28:55,750
No. A little elf wrote it.

1945
01:28:55,810 --> 01:28:57,414
Of course I wrote it.

1946
01:28:57,479 --> 01:28:59,425
You know, the children's story
was beautiful.

1947
01:28:59,481 --> 01:29:01,427
I'm not sure what
you're talking about.

1948
01:29:01,483 --> 01:29:03,087
I've written many of those,

1949
01:29:03,151 --> 01:29:04,755
and that was a long time ago.

1950
01:29:04,819 --> 01:29:06,264
And I'll tell you something--

1951
01:29:06,321 --> 01:29:08,858
If I thought people would
be rummaging through this,

1952
01:29:08,923 --> 01:29:10,698
I don't think
I would have saved anything.

1953
01:29:10,759 --> 01:29:13,706
What are you talking about, people?
I'm your goddamn son.

1954
01:29:13,762 --> 01:29:15,036
Please.

1955
01:29:15,096 --> 01:29:18,043
Oh, Mother, we're 7 walls away
from another ear.

1956
01:29:19,934 --> 01:29:21,880
What else did you look at?

1957
01:29:21,936 --> 01:29:24,212
I was just looking
through the boxes

1958
01:29:24,272 --> 01:29:26,411
and just seeing what was in them,
that's all.

1959
01:29:26,474 --> 01:29:29,045
That was another part of me.
That's the past.

1960
01:29:29,110 --> 01:29:30,555
You know I don't like
to look back.

1961
01:29:30,612 --> 01:29:31,886
Your father always said,

1962
01:29:31,946 --> 01:29:33,926
"Never look back.
They might be gaining on you."

1963
01:29:33,982 --> 01:29:36,087
I think it was Satchel Paige
who said that.

1964
01:29:37,786 --> 01:29:40,926
So when did you do all this stuff?

1965
01:29:40,989 --> 01:29:42,900
It was a long time ago.

1966
01:29:42,957 --> 01:29:44,561
You weren't even born then.

1967
01:29:44,626 --> 01:29:47,903
What are you doing?
You smoke?

1968
01:29:47,962 --> 01:29:50,067
I'll have one once a year

1969
01:29:50,131 --> 01:29:52,077
when I'm feeling this way.

1970
01:29:52,133 --> 01:29:54,909
Boy, you really must be upset.

1971
01:29:54,969 --> 01:29:57,575
Look, we're actually
using the living room.

1972
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:01,086
I'm going to take
all those boxes out of there.

1973
01:30:01,142 --> 01:30:02,917
You can have the entire closet.

1974
01:30:02,977 --> 01:30:04,581
We'll do it in the morning.

1975
01:30:04,646 --> 01:30:06,592
You don't have to
take the boxes out.

1976
01:30:06,648 --> 01:30:08,685
If you ask me not to look at it,
I won't look at it.

1977
01:30:08,750 --> 01:30:10,354
I think it'll be safer.

1978
01:30:10,418 --> 01:30:13,524
Oh, safer, whatever.
Take them all out. I don't care.

1979
01:30:13,588 --> 01:30:15,192
Honey, do you remember once

1980
01:30:15,256 --> 01:30:17,202
when I looked at
your high-school yearbook

1981
01:30:17,258 --> 01:30:19,829
and how upset you were because
of the pictures you didn't like?

1982
01:30:19,894 --> 01:30:22,204
You weren't looking
at my high-school yearbook.

1983
01:30:22,263 --> 01:30:24,209
You were showing it to everyone.

1984
01:30:24,265 --> 01:30:26,040
That's what I remember.

1985
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:28,376
"Look, everybody.
Doesn't his head look a little big?"

1986
01:30:28,436 --> 01:30:29,608
Remember?

1987
01:30:29,671 --> 01:30:32,151
Wait a second.

1988
01:30:32,207 --> 01:30:35,814
It just occurred to me.
This is why I write about big heads.

1989
01:30:35,877 --> 01:30:39,154
Oh, blame something else on me.

1990
01:30:39,214 --> 01:30:41,057
I'm not blaming anything on you.

1991
01:30:41,115 --> 01:30:42,890
I think that's
a very good character.

1992
01:30:42,951 --> 01:30:44,396
He's not a good character.

1993
01:30:44,452 --> 01:30:46,056
You want to know why?

1994
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:47,224
Yes.

1995
01:30:47,288 --> 01:30:49,393
You make someone
with a head that big,

1996
01:30:49,457 --> 01:30:51,403
but he's stupider
than everyone else.

1997
01:30:51,459 --> 01:30:53,063
I was just trying
to be different.

1998
01:30:53,127 --> 01:30:55,505
Why can't a guy have a big head
and still be stupid?

1999
01:30:55,563 --> 01:30:57,406
Why is his head that big, then?

2000
01:30:57,465 --> 01:30:59,911
Well, part of it's empty.

2001
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:01,914
Honey,
no God's going to create

2002
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:04,576
a head that big
with nothing in it.

2003
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:06,175
What about the dinosaurs?

2004
01:31:06,241 --> 01:31:07,413
Their heads were full.

2005
01:31:07,475 --> 01:31:09,011
They just had small heads.

2006
01:31:09,077 --> 01:31:12,684
You never saw a dinosaur
with a huge head and a little brain.

2007
01:31:12,747 --> 01:31:14,749
Their brain was the size
of their head.

2008
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:17,194
I don't know how the hell
we got on this subject,

2009
01:31:17,252 --> 01:31:20,028
but you should see yourself
when you talk to me about this.

2010
01:31:20,088 --> 01:31:21,692
You just light up.

2011
01:31:21,756 --> 01:31:23,702
Boy, Mother, you must have stuffed

2012
01:31:23,758 --> 01:31:27,103
the creative part of you
way down there somewhere.

2013
01:31:27,161 --> 01:31:30,540
Oh, no. You're not going
to analyze me at midnight.

2014
01:31:56,958 --> 01:32:00,064
Which children's story
did you read?

2015
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:03,473
The one about the flight
around the world.

2016
01:32:03,531 --> 01:32:06,239
That was about Amelia Earhart.

2017
01:32:06,301 --> 01:32:08,303
Do you remember her?

2018
01:32:08,369 --> 01:32:10,007
Yes, of course I do.

2019
01:32:10,071 --> 01:32:11,846
That was very clever,
what you did.

2020
01:32:11,906 --> 01:32:14,512
You took a real character,
but you turned it into fiction.

2021
01:32:14,575 --> 01:32:16,521
You know, that was
way ahead of your time.

2022
01:32:16,577 --> 01:32:18,147
Woodward and Bernstein did that.

2023
01:32:18,212 --> 01:32:20,749
I'm trying to think
of who that is.

2024
01:32:20,815 --> 01:32:22,658
It doesn't matter.
It's a compliment.

2025
01:32:22,717 --> 01:32:26,358
So tell me something-- where
did you learn all about this stuff?

2026
01:32:26,421 --> 01:32:28,697
Did you think
I was born yesterday?

2027
01:32:28,756 --> 01:32:31,032
You know, every child
thinks their mother

2028
01:32:31,092 --> 01:32:33,868
just came to life
when they were born.

2029
01:32:33,928 --> 01:32:36,670
I was around
a long time before you.

2030
01:32:36,731 --> 01:32:38,540
Well, that's the part
I'm trying to find out.

2031
01:32:38,599 --> 01:32:41,239
Every time I ask a question, you
don't seem to want to talk about it.

2032
01:32:41,302 --> 01:32:42,406
Well, it's in the past.

2033
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:45,713
Stop saying that, Mother.
It's not in the past.

2034
01:32:45,773 --> 01:32:48,811
That past is plopped
all over our lives.

2035
01:32:48,876 --> 01:32:50,549
How much have you written?

2036
01:32:50,611 --> 01:32:52,557
Did you ever get
anything published?

2037
01:32:52,613 --> 01:32:54,058
No, I never published.

2038
01:32:54,115 --> 01:32:56,117
Your father talked me out of it.

2039
01:32:56,184 --> 01:32:57,993
Why would he do that?

2040
01:32:58,052 --> 01:33:01,966
Well, you know, dear, in those days
a woman didn't have a career.

2041
01:33:02,023 --> 01:33:04,060
You know, she just...

2042
01:33:04,125 --> 01:33:07,572
Raised children who she hated
for ruining her life

2043
01:33:07,628 --> 01:33:11,735
and killing her chances at doing
the one thing she loved.

2044
01:33:14,802 --> 01:33:16,247
Well, my goodness.

2045
01:33:16,304 --> 01:33:20,081
I never heard it put
exactly like that,

2046
01:33:20,141 --> 01:33:22,087
but...yes...

2047
01:33:22,143 --> 01:33:25,090
I'm afraid that's true.

2048
01:33:25,146 --> 01:33:27,251
We did it.

2049
01:33:27,315 --> 01:33:29,727
We figured it out, Mother.

2050
01:33:29,784 --> 01:33:31,923
Look what just happened.

2051
01:33:31,986 --> 01:33:34,364
We know why you hate me.

2052
01:33:34,422 --> 01:33:36,868
We know why she hates me!

2053
01:33:36,924 --> 01:33:39,666
We know why she hates me...

2054
01:33:39,705 --> 01:33:41,905
We know why she hates me...

2055
01:33:42,063 --> 01:33:44,100
I don't hate you.
Stop it!

2056
01:33:44,165 --> 01:33:45,701
Sit down!

2057
01:33:45,767 --> 01:33:47,940
Mother, this is so exciting!

2058
01:33:48,002 --> 01:33:49,379
I want to hear everything.

2059
01:33:49,437 --> 01:33:51,610
Tell me exactly,
when did you start to write?

2060
01:33:51,672 --> 01:33:53,276
I started in high school,

2061
01:33:53,341 --> 01:33:55,446
and then I got
a scholarship to college.

2062
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:56,784
Because of the writing?

2063
01:33:56,844 --> 01:33:58,448
Yes. That's where I met
your father, in college.

2064
01:33:58,513 --> 01:33:59,651
You know that.

2065
01:33:59,714 --> 01:34:01,625
Yeah, but I never knew
how you got there.

2066
01:34:01,682 --> 01:34:03,662
No kid knows what
his parents majored in.

2067
01:34:03,718 --> 01:34:05,197
I never told you, huh?

2068
01:34:05,253 --> 01:34:07,563
So no wonder
you like Jeff better.

2069
01:34:07,622 --> 01:34:08,896
There's no threat there.

2070
01:34:08,956 --> 01:34:11,095
I just have to be
a huge threat to you.

2071
01:34:11,159 --> 01:34:13,070
I don't like Jeff better.

2072
01:34:13,127 --> 01:34:15,403
But still, he doesn't
represent the writer.

2073
01:34:15,463 --> 01:34:18,410
I represent
what you had to stop.

2074
01:34:20,134 --> 01:34:21,909
Maybe you're right.

2075
01:34:21,969 --> 01:34:23,949
How do you like that?

2076
01:34:24,005 --> 01:34:25,746
Listen to me.

2077
01:34:25,807 --> 01:34:27,582
I'm sorry, Mother.

2078
01:34:27,642 --> 01:34:30,748
I wish I could have done something
to change all of this--

2079
01:34:30,812 --> 01:34:31,916
you know that--

2080
01:34:31,979 --> 01:34:33,925
but I had nothing
to do with it.

2081
01:34:33,981 --> 01:34:37,588
But for the very first time,
for the first time,

2082
01:34:37,652 --> 01:34:41,122
I don't see you as my mother.

2083
01:34:41,189 --> 01:34:44,602
I see you as a failure...

2084
01:34:44,659 --> 01:34:46,969
And it's wonderful.

2085
01:34:47,028 --> 01:34:50,271
I'm a failure,
and that's wonderful?

2086
01:34:52,333 --> 01:34:54,108
All right, honey...

2087
01:34:54,168 --> 01:34:56,774
If that's what you need.

2088
01:35:12,787 --> 01:35:15,734
Mother, I'm going into town
for a little bit.

2089
01:35:15,790 --> 01:35:17,064
I'll be back later.

2090
01:35:17,125 --> 01:35:19,571
Oh, honey, listen.
I was thinking this morning.

2091
01:35:19,627 --> 01:35:22,073
As long as you have
your computer in there,

2092
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:24,576
I don't think one phone line
is enough.

2093
01:35:24,632 --> 01:35:27,078
So go ahead and get
the other phone line

2094
01:35:27,135 --> 01:35:29,081
that you wanted
just for the computer.

2095
01:35:29,137 --> 01:35:31,083
Thanks, but I don't need it.

2096
01:35:31,139 --> 01:35:32,243
Why?

2097
01:35:32,306 --> 01:35:34,411
Because we're through.

2098
01:35:34,475 --> 01:35:35,579
We did it.

2099
01:35:35,643 --> 01:35:36,917
We did?

2100
01:35:36,978 --> 01:35:39,083
Mother, I came here
not understanding anything,

2101
01:35:39,147 --> 01:35:41,423
and now I understand all of it.

2102
01:35:41,482 --> 01:35:43,758
So just live your life, OK?

2103
01:35:43,818 --> 01:35:47,095
Live your life,
and I'll do the best I can.

2104
01:35:47,155 --> 01:35:49,431
I don't blame you
for anything anymore.

2105
01:35:49,490 --> 01:35:50,764
It's not your fault.

2106
01:35:50,825 --> 01:35:52,805
I see you as a real person.

2107
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:54,100
You do?

2108
01:35:54,162 --> 01:35:56,267
Yes, and it's fine.

2109
01:35:56,330 --> 01:35:59,106
My goodness. I didn't get
that moment that you did.

2110
01:35:59,167 --> 01:36:00,612
You will. Don't worry.

2111
01:36:00,668 --> 01:36:02,944
So you don't need to stay, then?

2112
01:36:03,004 --> 01:36:04,312
No. I'm fine.

2113
01:36:04,372 --> 01:36:06,613
Go down to LA.
Stay with Jeff.

2114
01:36:06,674 --> 01:36:08,881
Sleep with Charles.
Do whatever you want.

2115
01:36:08,943 --> 01:36:10,286
Oh...

2116
01:36:10,344 --> 01:36:11,721
But, Mother, just think.

2117
01:36:11,779 --> 01:36:13,554
From now on,
when we talk on the phone,

2118
01:36:13,614 --> 01:36:15,890
we don't talk
as mother and son.

2119
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:17,554
We talk like 2 writers.

2120
01:36:17,618 --> 01:36:19,564
One blocked and insecure,

2121
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:21,531
One stifled and angry.

2122
01:36:21,589 --> 01:36:25,127
Which one am I, dear?
I forget.

2123
01:36:28,129 --> 01:36:31,008
So, are you going to
go back to work now?

2124
01:36:31,065 --> 01:36:33,909
No. I think I'm going to
take a couple of weeks off

2125
01:36:33,968 --> 01:36:35,572
and just enjoy this realization.

2126
01:36:35,636 --> 01:36:37,479
Maybe I'll even buy myself
some new clothes.

2127
01:36:37,538 --> 01:36:39,575
That's what I like to hear.

2128
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:42,018
Do buy yourself some new clothes.

2129
01:36:42,076 --> 01:36:44,249
All right,
I'll make you a deal.

2130
01:36:44,312 --> 01:36:46,588
For every new piece
of clothing I buy,

2131
01:36:46,647 --> 01:36:48,593
you buy one brand-new ounce

2132
01:36:48,649 --> 01:36:50,253
of very expensive cheese.

2133
01:36:51,819 --> 01:36:53,560
Does Kraft count?

2134
01:36:53,621 --> 01:36:58,092
Oh, Mother, that's so sweet.

2135
01:36:58,159 --> 01:37:01,766
Yes. Yes, Kraft counts.

2136
01:37:04,732 --> 01:37:06,109
I'll miss you.

2137
01:37:06,167 --> 01:37:07,942
I'll miss you, too, Mother.

2138
01:37:08,002 --> 01:37:10,039
Bye. Love you.

2139
01:37:10,104 --> 01:37:12,550
If it gets cold,
put the top up.

2140
01:37:44,305 --> 01:37:45,784
Oh, my God.

2141
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:48,411
John Henderson?

2142
01:37:50,645 --> 01:37:52,386
Yes?

2143
01:37:52,446 --> 01:37:57,259
Planet 7 was the best book
I've ever read.

2144
01:37:57,318 --> 01:37:59,594
What did you say?

2145
01:37:59,654 --> 01:38:02,601
Planet 7 was the best book
I've ever read.

2146
01:38:02,657 --> 01:38:04,432
You're kidding me.

2147
01:38:04,492 --> 01:38:07,268
Why would I kid you?
My God, what about Planet 8?

2148
01:38:07,328 --> 01:38:08,773
I loved that one, too.

2149
01:38:08,829 --> 01:38:10,831
You read Planet 8?

2150
01:38:10,898 --> 01:38:13,435
Yeah, and I read
The Day There Was No Earth twice.

2151
01:38:13,501 --> 01:38:14,707
Twice?

2152
01:38:14,769 --> 01:38:15,873
Mm-hmm.

2153
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:18,883
Did you like the character
with the big hand?

2154
01:38:18,939 --> 01:38:20,543
I loved that character.

2155
01:38:20,608 --> 01:38:22,246
Are you married?

2156
01:38:24,278 --> 01:38:26,224
No, I'm not married.

2157
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:27,884
So, where do you live?

2158
01:38:27,948 --> 01:38:29,018
In Los Angeles.

2159
01:38:29,083 --> 01:38:30,562
Well, me, too.

2160
01:38:30,618 --> 01:38:32,222
Why don't you follow me,

2161
01:38:32,286 --> 01:38:34,061
and we'll stop along the way

2162
01:38:34,121 --> 01:38:36,727
and talk and eat
and get to know each other.

2163
01:38:36,791 --> 01:38:38,566
By the time we get there,

2164
01:38:38,626 --> 01:38:40,196
it'll be like 5 dates.

2165
01:38:41,629 --> 01:38:44,075
God, that's so creative.

2166
01:38:44,131 --> 01:38:45,576
Um...

2167
01:38:45,633 --> 01:38:48,546
Well, yeah,
that sounds wonderful.

2168
01:38:48,602 --> 01:38:50,548
That's a yes?

2169
01:38:50,604 --> 01:38:53,016
That's a yes.

2170
01:38:53,074 --> 01:38:54,246
Great.

2171
01:38:54,308 --> 01:38:56,584
This isn't a practical joke,
is it?

2172
01:38:56,644 --> 01:39:00,751
Nobody sent you here,
like my brother or somebody.

2173
01:39:00,815 --> 01:39:02,658
What are you talking about?

2174
01:39:02,717 --> 01:39:04,754
Nothing. It's just
this liking me stuff

2175
01:39:04,819 --> 01:39:06,594
is all virgin territory,
that's all.

2176
01:39:06,654 --> 01:39:08,065
I'm not used to it.

2177
01:39:08,122 --> 01:39:10,295
I'll get used to it.

2178
01:39:10,358 --> 01:39:12,031
You'll help me.

2179
01:39:12,093 --> 01:39:14,539
You read the whole book...

2180
01:39:16,097 --> 01:39:17,542
OK, so follow me.

2181
01:39:17,598 --> 01:39:19,043
Follow you.

2182
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:08,692
Hello?

2183
01:40:08,749 --> 01:40:11,855
Oh, honey, I'm working.
May I call you back?

2184
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:13,695
Bye.
