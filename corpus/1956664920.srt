( Laughter )

37
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:12,422
Okay, that's enough of that.

38
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,092
You're very welcome.
Anytime.

( Sighs )

40
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:21,598
Okay, now...

41
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:26,144
I have to start by telling you

42
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:29,273
that my entire life

43
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,568
could be summed up
in one phrase,

44
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,112
and that is:

45
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,073
If my life wasn't funny

46
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:40,367
it would just be true,

47
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:44,121
and that is completely
unacceptable.

48
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,999
Now what that means is,

49
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:50,294
other than what it sounds like,

50
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,880
let's say something
happens, right?

51
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:57,134
And from a certain slant
maybe it's tragic,

52
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,012
even a little bit shocking.

53
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:03,932
And then time passes

54
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:06,226
and you go to the funny slant.

55
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,479
And now that very same thing

56
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:13,400
can no longer do you any harm.

57
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:17,863
So what we're really
talking about then

58
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:22,743
is location location location.

59
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:27,456
Now an example of
the tragic and shocking

60
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,459
might be:

61
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:33,962
About five years ago,

62
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:38,300
four months and nine days,

63
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:42,012
a friend of mine
died at my house.

64
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:45,140
But not content

65
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,351
to simply die at my house,

66
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:51,104
this guy also died in my bed.

67
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,481
Yeah.

68
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:56,109
So he didn't just
die in his sleep,

69
00:03:56,153 --> 00:04:00,322
he died in mine.

70
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:03,951
If you entertain like I do,

71
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,912
really try to alert your guests

72
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:10,582
not to do this, okay?

73
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,960
For two reasons really:

74
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,462
A... it's kind of bad manners

75
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:17,756
if you think about it, you know?

76
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,841
And two...

77
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,594
It tends to throw the host,

78
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:25,263
or hostess,

79
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,350
off their game
a little bit, you know,

80
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:30,519
like, for a year

81
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:33,188
or five.

82
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:36,316
Greg was one of my best friends.

83
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,945
He was not my boyfriend
or anything, you know.

84
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:43,156
I mean, he didn't die
in the saddle,

85
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,618
which would've made me
the saddle.

86
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:50,330
Now if you have, seriously,

87
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:52,374
any questions at all

88
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:55,252
about what it's like
to wake up next to a corpse

89
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,797
who was very recently
a beloved friend,

90
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:02,384
you could just shout out
whatever question you had

91
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:06,555
and I would do my very best
to field it.

92
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:12,269
So you've all woken up
with dead bodies?

93
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,813
Man:
What were you wearing?

94
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:18,316
What was I wearing?

95
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,777
You mean, if it was,
like, a wrong outfit

96
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,488
that might have killed him?

97
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:26,033
Now actually one of my
favorite questions

98
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,119
that I've been asked is
was I naked.

99
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,538
I haven't been naked

100
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:34,458
in 15 years.

101
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:38,336
And I haven't been
sleeveless in 20.

102
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,757
Some of you ladies know
what I'm talking about.

103
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,550
I should tell you at this point

104
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,302
just to get you going here,

105
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,387
Greg was a republican,

106
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,806
which I do believe
contributed in part

107
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,350
to his death.

108
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:55,520
( Applause )

109
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,230
Well, but no, he did...

110
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,441
He had a very very serious case.

111
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:01,526
He was a lobbyist,

112
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,197
which is obviously fatal
in some instances.

113
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,324
Woman:
What was he wearing?

114
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,451
What was he wearing?

115
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:13,246
What the fuck does it matter?

116
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,957
He was dead.

117
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,543
The dead, contrary to rumor,

118
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:21,463
don't give a shit about
what they're wearing.

119
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:24,633
Woman #2: Who was the
first person you called?

120
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,927
Who would you call
in that situation?

121
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,471
- Woman #2: I'm not sure.
- Woman #3: Your mother.

122
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:31,431
Well yes, that's true.

123
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,683
Well, now if you knew
my mother, maybe not.

124
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,645
911, okay?

125
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,022
And the police did come,
as they often do

126
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,025
when there are dead bodies
strewn about.

127
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,361
So I'm actually... I'm standing

128
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,738
in the living room
with this policeman.

129
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:50,617
He turns to me and he says,

130
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,869
"I really like
your house."

131
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:01,753
My friend Dave said to me
at the time,

132
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:04,881
"you know, honey,
I know this is all

133
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,968
just a gigantic
pain in the ass."

134
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,011
And I said,

135
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,264
"if I could isolate the pain

136
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,724
just to my ass,

137
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,811
it would be
fantastic."

138
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,855
And he said, "well,

139
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:24,025
that's the meditation
then."

140
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,154
Anyway, enough
about death, okay?

141
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,197
I just... I wanted to get

142
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,491
that bummer story out of the way

143
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,702
at the top of the show.

144
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:37,247
Now I was born
in Burbank, California,

145
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:42,002
to simple folk,

146
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,629
people of the land.

147
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,715
No, actually.

148
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,800
My father was a famous singer.

149
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:50,719
♪ Tweedle Dee, tweedle Dee ♪

150
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,847

151
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,308
<i>♪ I'm as happy
as can be... ♪</i>

152
00:07:56,351 --> 00:08:00,520
and my mom... you want to
hear something really cool?

153
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:03,190
My mother's a movie star.

154
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,026
- ( Fans cheering )
- Woman:<i> Debbie, we love you!</i>

155
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,533
She is literally,
like, an icon...

156
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,286
A gay icon,

157
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,664
but you take your iconic stature

158
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,584
where you can get it.

159
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,586
My father...

160
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,047
He had a lot of hit songs.

161
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,841
But I think the one
he's best remembered for

162
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:32,469
is the song
"oh! My papa"...

163
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:36,973
<i>♪ Oh! My papa... ♪</i>

164
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,975
which I like to call

165
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,228
"oh my faux pas."

166
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,730
And my mother, she had...

167
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,774
She did tons of films, you know,

168
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,985
but probably the one
she's best remembered for

169
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,738
is the classic film
"singing in the rain."

170
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,952
<i>She was also nominated for
an Oscar for best actress</i>

171
00:08:56,995 --> 00:09:00,580
<i>for her work in
"the unsinkable Molly brown."</i>

172
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,959
But she lost to Julie Andrews

173
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,461
for her stunning, layered

174
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,880
and moving portrait

175
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:12,008
of Mary poppins.

176
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:16,304
I think it was
ibsen's "Mary poppins."

177
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,056
And my mother...

178
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,392
She also made another film
called "Tammy,"

179
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,978
which was a hit song as well,

180
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,021
which really pissed off my dad

181
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,982
'cause that was
his area, you know?

182
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:30,860
♪ Tammy, Tammy ♪

183
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,656
♪ can't let him go... ♪

184
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,783
<i>she was... actually
she was pregnant with me</i>

185
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,285
when she filmed
"Tammy."

186
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,287
She was also pregnant with me

187
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,330
in yet another film.

188
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:45,208
And this one was called
"a bundle of joy,"

189
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:49,087
costarring that
marvelous method actor

190
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:51,339
Eddie Fisher.

191
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,300
<i>( Swing music playing )</i>

192
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,511
Pregnant, okay?

193
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:58,513
Oh, now you're gonna see

194
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,849
lamaze in the '50s coming up.

195
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:05,854
There it is.
Oh yeah.

196
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:09,941
I think that explains
a lot, don't you?

197
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:13,528
( Applause )

198
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:16,031
Yeah.

199
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,866
When I was born

200
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,076
my mom was given anesthesia.

201
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,370
They didn't have epidurals
in those days, right?

202
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:25,498
So my mother was unconscious.

203
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,792
Now my mother

204
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,420
is a beautiful woman.

205
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,590
I mean, seriously,
she's beautiful today at 78.

206
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,384
At 24

207
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:39,721
she looked like
a Christmas morning.

208
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:43,058
So all the doctors... they're
buzzing around her head going,

209
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,185
"oh look, there's
Debbie Reynolds asleep.

210
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,728
How pretty."

211
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:50,065
Then my father, upon seeing me,

212
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,192
you know,
start to come through...

213
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:56,237
Crown, with all the placenta
and the... ugh...

214
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,532
My father faints dead away.

215
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,910
So now all the nurses go,

216
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,120
"oh look, there's
Eddie Fisher the crooner

217
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,207
on the ground.
Let's go look at him."

218
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,001
So when I arrived

219
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:13,338
I was virtually unattended.

220
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:16,174
And I've been trying

221
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:21,137
to make up for that fact
ever since.

222
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,181
Even this show tonight

223
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:26,142
is a pathetic bid
for the attention

224
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,353
that I lacked as a newborn.

225
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:30,146
- <i>( Applause )</i>
- Oh, thank you.

226
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,023
That helps so much.

227
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,608
Yeah.

228
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:36,194
My dad... he was best friends

229
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:39,364
with this very very
charismatic producer

230
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,991
whose name was Mike Todd.

231
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,993
He produced a film called

232
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,787
"around the world in 80 days,"

233
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:48,331
which won an Oscar
for best picture.

234
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,543
So my father, my mother,

235
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:53,962
Mike Todd and his fiancee,

236
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:57,132
who happened to be
Elizabeth Taylor...

237
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:00,552
Well, you know,
they went everywhere together, right?

238
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,555
<i>I mean, they went to nightclubs.
They went on cruises.</i>

239
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:06,224
<i>They literally traveled
the world.</i>

240
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:09,310
<i>So when Mike and Elizabeth
got married,</i>

241
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:12,355
<i>my father was
Mike Todd's best man</i>

242
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,524
<i>and my mother was</i>

243
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:17,277
Elizabeth's matron of honor.

244
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,362
Yeah.

245
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:23,366
She even washed her hair
on her wedding day.

246
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,411
Now later I did hear her mumble

247
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:30,540
that she wished
she'd washed it with nair.

248
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,835
But she's not a bitter
woman really, you know.

249
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:37,881
Anyway, I was about
one and a half or two

250
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,507
when my brother was born.

251
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,343
And my father... he so adored

252
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,429
this man Mike Todd

253
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:47,640
that my brother Todd
was named for him.

254
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:50,643
But, you know,
in the Jewish faith

255
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,313
it is considered back luck

256
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,398
to name a newborn

257
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:58,193
after someone
who's still living...

258
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:01,988
A silly superstition...

259
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,578
Or so they thought.

260
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,580
'Cause about a year later

261
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,041
Mike Todd took off

262
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,793
in a private plane
in a rainstorm.

263
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,879
Newscaster: <i>Miss Taylor
was in a state of collapse</i>

264
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:21,174
<i>following the death of her
husband in a plane crash.</i>

265
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,176
And the following morning

266
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,386
Elizabeth was a widow.

267
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,263
Well, you know,

268
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,850
naturally my father flew

269
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:33,353
<i>to Elizabeth's side,</i>

270
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,355
gradually making his way

271
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,566
slowly to her front.

272
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,487
( Laughter )

273
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:47,158
He dried her eyes
with his handkerchief.

274
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:49,410
<i>He consoled her with flowers.</i>

275
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,371
And ultimately he consoled her

276
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:55,124
with his penis.

277
00:13:55,168 --> 00:14:00,630
This made marriage
to my mother awkward.

278
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:04,259
And so he was gone
within the week.

279
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,302
Newscaster: <i>Debbie
Reynolds went into court</i>

280
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,407
<i>and in five minutes had
a divorce from Eddie Fisher.</i>

281
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:11,015
<i>Showing no emotion,
the 26-year-old testified</i>

282
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:14,185
<i>her husband had become
interested in another woman.</i>

283
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:16,938
<i>It wasn't long afterward
that the singer was married</i>

284
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:19,440
<i>to the widow of his
good friend Mike Todd.</i>

285
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:22,443
Recently my daughter Billie...

286
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,321
She's actually
about to turn 18...

287
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,949
She had a flirtation

288
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:31,035
with Mike Todd
and Elizabeth's grandson.

289
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,373
And when they first met,
you know,

290
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,375
they were trying to work out

291
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,836
how it all fit together, right,

292
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,464
and if they were
related in any way.

293
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:47,218
So I thought about it.

294
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,262
Now when I think,

295
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,973
I need an enormous blackboard.

296
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,851
Also it is helpful

297
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,811
if I can have a stick.

298
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,938
That way I could point

299
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:02,567
to the various people
on the blackboard and...

300
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:05,403
When you pray.

301
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,572
This is garret...

302
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:11,117
My spiritual advisor
and gynecologist.

303
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:13,786
Thank you.

304
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,081
Well, you never know.

305
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:21,586
So welcome, class,
to Hollywood 101.

306
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,964
All right, so over here

307
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,175
we have Debbie and Eddie.

308
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:30,219
Now in the '50s they were known

309
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,889
as America's sweethearts.

310
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,058
For those of you
that are younger,

311
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:38,227
try to think of it this way:

312
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:41,147
Think of Eddie as Brad Pitt,

313
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:43,191
Debbie as Jennifer Aniston

314
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:47,111
and Elizabeth as Angelina Jolie.

315
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,864
Does that help?

316
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:53,117
That should help, right?

317
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,161
All right, so...

318
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:58,247
Eddie consoles Elizabeth
with his penis.

319
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,708
Elizabeth takes
a movie in Rome...

320
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:03,127
A big-budget film
"Cleopatra."

321
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,883
<i>She meets her costar
Richard Burton.</i>

322
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:13,012
Well, goodbye Eddie,
hello Richard.

323
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,264
The two of them...
They hit it off

324
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,517
like gangbusters, you know?

325
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,977
And they met and they married

326
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:24,107
and they had a wild,
tempestuous relationship

327
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,485
of Violet eyes and Welsh accents

328
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,487
and drinking and dancing

329
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,447
and lust and joy and fun.

330
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:35,284
But it was a tempestuous
relationship.

331
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,704
So after a while

332
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,957
the storm clouds came,
and what happened?

333
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,586
No cheating.
What?

334
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,924
Storm clouds are a negative.

335
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,551
Woman:
Divorce.

336
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,761
- Divorce, okay. What's your name?
- Nicole.

337
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,388
- What?
- Nicole.

338
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:57,432
Nicole.
Okay, Nicole,

339
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,851
what we do with our
better students

340
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,270
here at Hollywood 101...

341
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:06,065
We provide them with a medal.

342
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,609
Think of it as a metaphor

343
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,820
- for getting a medal.
- Okay.

344
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:14,115
- Look, it's kind of like being in "the
wizard of oz." -<i> Should I come and get it?</i>

345
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:17,410
♪ You're out of the woods, you're out
of the dark, you're out of the... ♪

346
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:20,455
- now look, you have to undo
it because... - oh, thank you.

347
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,999
There we go.
Now, Nicole, you still...

348
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,501
- The medal fell off.
- Oh Jesus.

349
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,921
Well, let me just put it
in your cleavage then.

350
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,923
( Audience laughter )

351
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,050
- Which is ample.
- That's good.

352
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,052
- Okay.
- Thank you.

353
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,263
Now, Nicole,

354
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,223
you're gonna have to
still earn this, okay?

355
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,203
- Okay, I got it.
- All right, you can sit back down.

356
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:44,979
- All right, so...
- ( Applause )

357
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,899
As Nicole said,

358
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,443
they did get a divorce.

359
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,904
But they had

360
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,656
good memories of each other,

361
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,784
so, Nicole, what'd they do then?

362
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:01,204
- They got married again.
- They remarried. Exactly.

363
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,164
All right, now keep that in mind

364
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,500
'cause it might come up again.

365
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,710
Let's go to Debbie, okay?

366
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,129
Debbie does not want

367
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:12,924
another man who'll just run off.

368
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,759
So she marries

369
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:18,513
someone very very old,
who can't run.

370
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:22,433
<i>Now he just sits in a chair,</i>

371
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,310
he smokes and he drinks.

372
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:27,271
<i>And after about 13 years</i>

373
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,690
he loses all his money

374
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,485
and then he takes all hers...

375
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,861
Fun.

376
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:36,322
And they got divorced.

377
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,741
And she was alone for a while.

378
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,994
But then fate intervened

379
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:46,082
and brought her this sociopath.

380
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,501
Yeah, that's Richard hamlett.

381
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:51,671
He had money issues too...
Her money.

382
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,923
But now before we get
too far past

383
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,800
this first stepfather
right here,

384
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,886
this man is named Harry Karl.

385
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,681
Harry was a shoe tycoon.

386
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,724
Doesn't sound like those words

387
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:06,477
should fit together, does it?
In this case they do.

388
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:09,647
All right,
so prior to being married to my mom,

389
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,983
Harry was married
to this woman right here.

390
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:15,278
This is Marie McDonald...

391
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,906
<i>Marie "the body" McDonald,</i>

392
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,658
<i>as she was known.</i>

393
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:24,078
Marie was an actress... ish.

394
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:28,916
And so they met
and they married,

395
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,004
and they had a wild,
tempestuous relationship.

396
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,755
They had a child.

397
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,716
And that went so well,

398
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,093
they adopted two more.

399
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,512
Now Marie McDonald

400
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:45,933
was a very optimistic,
romantic woman.

401
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:49,228
And I say this
because she married

402
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:52,273
a grand total of nine times.

403
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:54,150
Yeah.

404
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:58,487
Now that is a record
for the board.

405
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,531
And that is saying something,

406
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:02,825
because this is
a marrying board.

407
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,536
If you marry that many times,

408
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,830
you're bound to get
a headache, no?

409
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,291
Twice gave me a whopper.

410
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:13,252
Anyway, I think it did,
you know,

411
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,338
give poor Marie a headache

412
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,507
because she wound up
addicted to painkillers.

413
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,593
Now you want to hear
something really wild?

414
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,929
I just found this out.

415
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:26,474
If you get addicted
to painkillers,

416
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:31,145
it can turn out to go
very wrong for you.

417
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:34,148
Who knew that?

418
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:36,609
It did go wrong for Marie,

419
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:40,237
because she ended up
overdosing and passing on.

420
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:43,366
And that last husband of hers

421
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,118
shot himself.

422
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:49,080
Well, they loved each other
to death.

423
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:53,459
So now there are
these three children left.

424
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:54,877
What should we do with them?

425
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,462
Oh, I know.

426
00:20:56,506 --> 00:21:00,466
Let's send them
to Harry and Debbie.

427
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,510
They are told

428
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:05,137
that one of these three children

429
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:08,015
should be institutionalized.

430
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:11,060
But my mother is a good person,

431
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:15,564
much like Sarah Palin,
only smarter.

432
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:19,485
And she said, "absolutely not.

433
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:21,529
We will put her

434
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:24,782
in Carrie's room!"

435
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:28,703
It's funny now.

436
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:32,581
Now let's go to Eddie, shall we?

437
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,334
How do you follow an act
like Elizabeth Taylor, right?

438
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,211
So he... he thinks of
something though.

439
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:39,255
He does pull something together.

440
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,008
He meets this woman right here.

441
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:45,094
Now this is a blonde, cute,

442
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,596
<i>perky little actress.</i>

443
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,474
<i>Sounds familiar, doesn't it?</i>

444
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,810
<i>No, it's not Debbie again.</i>

445
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:55,146
It's a tribute to Debbie.

446
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,815
It's Connie Stevens!

447
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:59,859
So they met and they had

448
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:02,611
joely Fisher and tricia Fisher.

449
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,823
Oh wait.
Hang on a second.

450
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:08,117
Did they forget to get married?

451
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,828
They did.
They forgot.

452
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:14,165
Well, but now they remember
and they marry.

453
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,877
But as all of you know,

454
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,964
legal sex is just shite.

455
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:26,052
They have the dreadful
legal sex.

456
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:29,430
The storm clouds come.
Nicole, what happened?

457
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:31,682
- They get divorced.
- They got a divorce.

458
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:35,519
But don't worry.
My father's not alone for long.

459
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:39,023
Because now he meets and marries

460
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:41,609
this girl...

461
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,945
Miss Louisiana!

462
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:48,741
<i>Yes, she's three years
older than I am</i>

463
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,951
<i>and she calls me
"dear."</i>

464
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:54,163
She's in her early 20s.
He's in his late 50s.

465
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:58,042
She had so many years
to devote to him.

466
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:00,252
But weirdly,

467
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,713
after a very short time,

468
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:04,590
Nicole, what happened?

469
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,675
They divorced.

470
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:10,638
They divorced.
I was stunned.

471
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,640
But don't worry.

472
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:15,643
My father is not alone for long.

473
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:18,854
Because now he meets and marries

474
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,606
this woman right here.

475
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,775
<i>This is Betty lin.
Betty's from Shanghai.</i>

476
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:24,777
<i>And she takes great care
of my dad,</i>

477
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,695
<i>which, you know, he needs.</i>

478
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,948
Also, Betty is rich,

479
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,283
which is handy, 'cause my father

480
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:34,286
has gone bankrupt
four times by now.

481
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,497
Anyway, they're together

482
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:39,166
15 glorious years.

483
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,086
But then, Nicole, what happened?

484
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,130
- They got a divorce?
- No.

485
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:46,257
- No?
- This is a trick question.

486
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,468
She did... she passed away.

487
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:51,846
I know.
It was really sad.

488
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:54,265
But don't worry.

489
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:57,518
My dad is not alone for long.

490
00:23:57,562 --> 00:24:01,939
Because now my father dates

491
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:05,025
<i>all of Chinatown!</i>

492
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,986
<i>Well, now hang on a second now.</i>

493
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:10,698
My father has had
so many facelifts

494
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:13,200
that he looks Asian himself.

495
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:16,036
It makes it more right.

496
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,581
You know what I'm talking about.

497
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:22,501
So let's recap, shall we?

498
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:25,671
Okay, Eddie and Debbie
have the good sex.

499
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:28,799
They celebrate.
They have Todd and myself.

500
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:30,718
I grow up... ( Chuckles )

501
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,595
A matter of opinion.

502
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:35,556
And I meet and marry
this man right here.

503
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,058
<i>This is Paul Simon.</i>

504
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:41,937
Paul Simon is a short
Jewish singer.

505
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,774
( Laughter )

506
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:50,905
A short Jewish singer.

507
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:53,115
Any questions?

508
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,743
My mother makes a blueprint

509
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:58,120
and I follow it to the letter.

510
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:01,040
All right, so Paul and i...
Great marriage,

511
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:04,460
words words, so many words,

512
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,795
big words, clever words.

513
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:10,090
Uh-oh, the words get mean, Nicole.
What happened?

514
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,218
- You divorced.
- We divorced.

515
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,970
But don't worry.
I am not alone for long,

516
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:19,433
because now I meet
this goy... guy.

517
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:21,268
This guy.

518
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:24,104
This is Bryan lourd.
Bryan's a talent agent...

519
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:27,066
Less words, good sex.
We celebrate.

520
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:30,110
We have Billie lourd, okay?

521
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:32,071
Elizabeth Taylor and Mike Todd...

522
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,114
They have Liza Todd.

523
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,116
And when Mike passes away,

524
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,535
my father adopts her.

525
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:42,331
Also, Liza is
a wonderful sculptress.

526
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:45,709
And she meets and marries
her art professor...

527
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:48,379
Professor hap tivey.

528
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:52,758
Hap is short for happy,
so he's not Jewish.

529
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:57,429
Anyway, they meet
and they celebrate.

530
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:01,976
They have Quinn tivey
and Rhys tivey.

531
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:04,728
So Quinn tivey

532
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:07,856
and Billie lourd...

533
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,110
Are they related?

534
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,487
Man:<i> No.</i>

535
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,613
Are they?

536
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:16,407
Audience:
No.

537
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,618
<i>Yes, they are.</i>

538
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:21,495
I told them,

539
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:24,331
"you are related
by scandal."

540
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:28,210
I just... I hope
the two of them marry

541
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:31,547
so all this
will have been worthwhile.

542
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,467
And that is
Hollywood inbreeding,

543
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,095
ladies and gentlemen.

544
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:42,558
( Grunts )

545
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,476
Hollywood inbreeding...

546
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,438
It's a little bit like royal
inbreeding, you know.

547
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,523
And celebrity...

548
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:53,110
It's kind of like
America's royalty, right?

549
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:55,154
I actually...

550
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:58,324
I like to think of celebrity

551
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:02,703
as just obscurity
biding its time.

552
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:04,663
So...

553
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:08,083
<i>( Laughter )</i>

554
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:12,463
So my brother and I

555
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:15,257
grew up watching our parents'

556
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:20,095
once white hot,
bright star of celebrity

557
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:24,183
slowly dim, cool and fade.

558
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,268
We watched this

559
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,729
from a house that I call
the embassy.

560
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:31,774
'Cause really it looked
much more like a place

561
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:34,943
where you'd get your passport
stamped, you know,

562
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,112
well, than a house.

563
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:40,157
I mean, where would you put a
Christmas wreath on a thing like this?

564
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:42,785
It looks like an air
conditioner, doesn't it?

565
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:46,163
So obviously
it is a modern house,

566
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:48,165
a warm house.

567
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:50,209
And it had things

568
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:53,337
that most normal houses
don't have.

569
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:55,381
For example, we had

570
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:58,509
eight little pink refrigerators

571
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:03,639
in case snow white and the
seven dwarves showed up.

572
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,724
And we had a lanai.

573
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:08,602
Oh, we had three pools,

574
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:11,647
<i>in case two broke.</i>

575
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,610
<i>My stepfather Harry Karl...</i>

576
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:18,612
I don't know if you
noticed or not...

577
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:21,990
He wasn't really a handsome man.

578
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,535
<i>But because he was wealthy</i>

579
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,578
<i>and well-groomed,</i>

580
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,872
<i>he was said to be
distinguished-looking.</i>

581
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:32,751
That's ugly with money.

582
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:35,379
( Chuckles )

583
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:38,465
Actually they made a movie

584
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:41,385
about Harry Karl
and Marie McDonald

585
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:43,429
and the multiple marriages,

586
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,806
and it was called
"the marrying man."

587
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:50,394
And Alec Baldwin
played Harry Karl.

588
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:52,604
And I think the resemblance

589
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:55,607
is astonishing.
I really do.

590
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:58,193
Oh, and the barber
that came every day

591
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,195
to keep him
distinguished-looking,

592
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,906
we found out later

593
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,994
that that barber
was actually a pimp

594
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:10,122
with a talent for hair.

595
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,583
And for those of you with pimps,

596
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:16,003
Nicole, you know, they usually...

597
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:19,423
They can't do hair for shit.

598
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:22,926
So, you know, this made
marriage to my mother awkward,

599
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,762
so what she did though was...
She's crafty...

600
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:28,515
She got... she took this
musical in New York

601
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,851
to get out of the marriage,

602
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:32,853
which in Hollywood is actually

603
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:35,355
a legal way to dissolve a union

604
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,900
without involving lawyers.

605
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,068
And she took me
out of high school

606
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:43,322
and put me in the chorus
of this musical.

607
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:46,325
<i>And I don't care
what you've heard,</i>

608
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,661
chorus work is far more valuable

609
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:54,124
than an education would ever be,

610
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:56,376
clearly.

611
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,879
I grew up...

612
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:00,923
I grew up knowing

613
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,883
that I had the prettiest mother

614
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:05,010
of anyone in my class.

615
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:07,429
But, you know, my mom...

616
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,848
She's also... she's a
little bit eccentric.

617
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:13,143
I mean, she does... she
has a lot of unique ideas.

618
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:16,104
For example, she thought

619
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,524
that I should have a child

620
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,943
with her last husband Richard

621
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:24,071
because it would have nice eyes.

622
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:27,199
I should probably
explain this to you

623
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:29,034
before you think it's weird.

624
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:31,995
Uh, see, the thing is,

625
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,706
my mother... she'd gone
through the change, you know?

626
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,292
So she didn't... she couldn't
have children anymore.

627
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:40,128
And Richard didn't have any
children of his own yet.

628
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,172
And he had nice eyes.

629
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:44,967
And my womb was free.

630
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,178
And we're related.

631
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:50,180
My mother wants me
to explain to you

632
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:53,517
that she thought that you
could inseminate someone

633
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:56,979
by giving them
an injection in your arm,

634
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,273
putting the semen right here.

635
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,733
If she ever thought

636
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,902
that it involved
something southerly,

637
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:07,322
she never would've
suggested it, okay?

638
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:11,159
Now my mother did not just
bring this up once or twice

639
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,537
like a normal mother would,

640
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:15,622
like you would.

641
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:19,459
No, she brought it up
many many times

642
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:23,422
and mostly while I was driving.

643
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:28,135
And when I finally
suggested to her

644
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:30,762
that, you know, might be
an odd idea,

645
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:34,182
she said, "oh darling,

646
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:37,853
have you read
'the enquirer' lately?

647
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:41,773
We live in a very
strange world."

648
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:48,739
Well, when "the enquirer"

649
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:51,742
becomes your standard
for living,

650
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:55,078
you're in a lot of trouble.

651
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:57,080
When I told my grandmother

652
00:31:57,124 --> 00:31:59,082
about my mom's idea,

653
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,126
she said,

654
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,587
"well, that's not
right."

655
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:06,757
The voice of reason, right?

656
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,717
My grandma Maxine...

657
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:10,844
<i>She was from El Paso, Texas.</i>

658
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:12,888
<i>My mother's whole clan</i>

659
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,057
<i>was from Texas
and all around there.</i>

660
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,601
And my father's people
were from south Philly,

661
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:19,186
in that area.

662
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:22,773
So basically we're white trash.

663
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:25,400
Well, because of
the celebrity factor though,

664
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:29,321
I like to think of us as
blue-blooded white trash, you know.

665
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:32,115
Anyway, I bring up
my grandmother

666
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,119
because when my mother
was about seven,

667
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:39,247
my grandmother locked her
in the closet.

668
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,833
So after my mom

669
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:44,878
had been in the closet
about an hour,

670
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:48,006
she asked my grandmother
for a glass of water.

671
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:51,385
And my grandmother
naturally said, "why?"

672
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,679
And my mother said,

673
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:57,474
"because I've spit
all over your dresses

674
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:59,518
and now I've run out of spit

675
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:04,523
and I want to spit
all over your shoes."

676
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:08,944
These are the people
I hail from, okay?

677
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,530
My mother and i...

678
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,573
Ultimately we didn't go forward

679
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,784
with the plan for me
to have Richard's baby.

680
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:18,578
Yeah, and I know it's
probably best we didn't.

681
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:20,997
Well, I mean,
aside from the obvious...

682
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,417
My sister, my daughter,

683
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,837
my sister, my daughter...

684
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:29,131
Ow...

685
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:33,468
My mother ended up
hating Richard.

686
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:36,263
And she had a really
really good reason.

687
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:38,348
This man...

688
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:40,350
He broke her pension plan.

689
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:43,145
Ow.
That's hard to do.

690
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:46,148
And he took
all the money she'd made

691
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:49,317
since Harry took
the first batch.

692
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,611
So she says to me at this point,

693
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,739
"you know, dear,

694
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:57,826
Eddie's starting to look
like the good husband."

695
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:02,414
"Eddie the good husband"

696
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,875
by Anton Chekhov.

697
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:08,962
What can you really say

698
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:12,007
about my father?

699
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,217
I'm asking you.

700
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,720
All right, well,
I don't know what you can say,

701
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:18,847
but here's what I can say.

702
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:21,725
My father...

703
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:24,519
He is unbelievably charming.

704
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:26,480
I mean, seriously,
you would love him.

705
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:28,273
He's adorable.

706
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:31,318
I mean, there is a reason
that he was able to score

707
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:33,779
all that unbelievable pussy...

708
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:36,490
Well, you know, I mean,

709
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:39,534
and get all those fantastic
women to marry him.

710
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:45,749
Eddie Fisher:
<i>♪ if I loved you ♪</i>

711
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:48,251
<i>♪ time and again... ♪</i>

712
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:49,961
<i>my father is 81</i>

713
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:53,131
and he smokes five joints a day,

714
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:55,926
for medicinal
purposes, of course.

715
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:58,929
So we call him puff daddy.

716
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:00,847
Um...

717
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:02,891
<i>( Applause )</i>

718
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:05,852
No, the great thing
about that is...

719
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:08,355
We did this show near to
where my dad lives.

720
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:10,357
So he came to the opening night

721
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,943
and he brought his dealer.

722
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:15,028
Which was fantastic, you know,

723
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,489
'cause you really want
the dealer's point of view

724
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:19,533
on any work you do.

725
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,493
Right?

726
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:24,788
You know what I'm talking about.

727
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:28,500
Actually a few months back

728
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:32,754
I sent my father a couple a
strippers, as one does.

729
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:37,634
And he was
unbelievably grateful.

730
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:39,886
He called me and he said,

731
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:43,223
"baby, I will do
anything you say.

732
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:45,225
I mean, you say, 'run, '

733
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:49,062
and I say,
'how high?'"

734
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:52,148
now...

735
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,110
Anyway, a few years back

736
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,529
Billie and I went
to San Francisco

737
00:35:57,573 --> 00:35:59,614
to visit my... where he lives,

738
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:04,077
'cause there is a really
big Chinatown there.

739
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:06,329
There is.

740
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:09,124
And the day before, my father...

741
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,084
He'd gotten these
little hearing aids.

742
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:12,794
You know those teeny tiny ones?

743
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,964
They fit right in your ears, right?
They're super expensive.

744
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,632
Well, my dad...

745
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,676
He'd gotten them
the day before, right?

746
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,470
So the night before he
didn't want to lose them

747
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:23,722
or forget where they were,

748
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:27,058
so he put them in his pillbox

749
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:29,686
next to his bed
so that he would reme...

750
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:32,480
<i>( laughter )</i>

751
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:36,526
Yes, in the morning he ate them.

752
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:40,030
So whenever he couldn't
hear Billie or myself,

753
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:44,701
we'd yell into his stomach
or his ass.

754
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:47,245
I wish I was kidding.

755
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:51,333
Subsequently he got
the hearing aids again

756
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:54,711
and I did have the
opportunity to see them.

757
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:57,088
They are size of a Lima bean...

758
00:36:57,132 --> 00:37:01,760
A rubber Lima bean
with an antenna.

759
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:04,804
Now look, I adore pills.

760
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:07,223
I mean, seriously, huge fan.

761
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:09,768
But these were truly

762
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:13,563
like none I had ever seen.

763
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:16,942
I don't know what you're
like in the morning.

764
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:20,320
Well, I know
what you're like, but...

765
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:22,364
I am not that sharp,

766
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,324
but I think I would know

767
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:26,368
if I were eating

768
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,204
a rubber Lima bean
with an antenna

769
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:33,124
twice.

770
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:37,963
Well, if you have
a life like mine...

771
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:40,340
And I know some of you do,

772
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:43,802
'cause I recognize you
from my group,

773
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,137
yes...

774
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:49,891
Then these things...
They gradually accumulate

775
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:52,978
until you become known
as a survivor.

776
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,854
It's a term I really don't...

777
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,731
I don't like it,
you know, really.

778
00:37:56,775 --> 00:38:00,110
But the thing is,
when you are a survivor...

779
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:01,903
Which, okay, whatever.

780
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:04,614
I, you know,
reluctantly agree that I am,

781
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:07,784
and who here over 40 isn't?

782
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:10,537
But when you are a survivor,

783
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,456
in order to be
a really good one,

784
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,251
you have to keep
getting in trouble

785
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,254
to show off your gift.

786
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,673
Now my mother says,

787
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:24,592
"well, dear,
what are the choices?

788
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,886
Not surviving?"

789
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,347
My mother,

790
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:32,142
who incidentally lives
next door to me...

791
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:35,770
That's not funny...

792
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:39,649
She calls me to this day
and says,

793
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:41,651
"hello, dear.

794
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:43,862
This is your mother
Debbie."

795
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,950
Hey, it could be
my mother Vladimir.

796
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:51,411
You never ever know.

797
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:54,664
I had been singing
in my mother's nightclub act

798
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,374
since I was about 13,

799
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:58,626
you know, like most teenagers.

800
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:02,630
And I continued to perform
with her till I was 17.

801
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,800
Don't be nervous.
It's just all show business. That's all.

802
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,011
Would you sing my favorite
for me for Julie and Jerry?

803
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:11,389
Don't say no.
Just sing right out.

804
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:14,350
And the last place
that we played together

805
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:16,644
was the London palladium.

806
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:20,482
And I got pretty good reviews.

807
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:24,235
So this choreographer guy
Ron something...

808
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:27,238
Anyway, he calls me
and he asks me

809
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,199
if I want to do
my own nightclub act.

810
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:31,451
My mother... my mother thought

811
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:34,079
this was truly a lousy idea.

812
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:36,122
She thought instead

813
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:39,250
that I should go to
drama college in england

814
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:42,921
because it would bring
respectability to the family.

815
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:46,216
Like we were a bunch
of hookers, you know,

816
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:48,259
and drama college in england

817
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:51,554
is the only way to
eradicate a taint like that.

818
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:54,933
Anyway, so now it's 1973

819
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,935
and I'm 17

820
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:59,020
and I'm enrolled

821
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:03,191
in the central school of
speech and drama in London.

822
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:05,235
<i>And, you know, like I said,</i>

823
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:08,947
<i>at first I just... I
really did not want to go.</i>

824
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:13,118
<i>But once I got there,
it was truly</i>

825
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,120
<i>some of the best times
of my life.</i>

826
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:19,332
<i>I mean, it was the only
unexamined part of my life</i>

827
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:22,460
where I was just a student
among students,

828
00:40:22,504 --> 00:40:24,921
going to voice
and movement class

829
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:26,965
and learning

830
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:30,468
weird little
tongue twisters like...

831
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:32,554
"all I want is a proper
cup of coffee

832
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,700
made in a proper copper coffee pot.
You can believe it or not,

833
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:36,536
but I want a cup of coffee
in a proper coffee pot.

834
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,185
Tin coffee pots and iron coffee
pots... they're no use to me.

835
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:41,666
If I can't have a proper cup of
coffee in a proper copper coffee pot,

836
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,690
- I'll have a cup of tea."
- <i>( Applause )</i>

837
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:46,317
Now... oh, thank you so much.

838
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,361
If you enjoyed

839
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:51,156
my performance
as Princess Leia...

840
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,199
And who could resist

841
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:56,494
my stunning, layered, moving,

842
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:59,664
not-unlike-Mary-poppins
performance?

843
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:03,960
Then it is thanks to
tongue twisters like that.

844
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:06,171
Consider:

845
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:09,090
"You'll never get that bucket
of bolts past that blockade,

846
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:11,467
proper copper
coffee pot."

847
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:13,553
Or:

848
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:17,682
"Why, you stuck-up, half-witted,

849
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:20,059
scruffy-looking nerf herder.

850
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:23,229
Proper copper coffee pot,
I'd like a cup of tea."

851
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:27,275
It's dialogue from
the "star wars" film.

852
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:32,655
And don't forget,

853
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:37,160
I had that weird little
English accent

854
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:40,163
that came and went

855
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:42,957
like weather or bloat

856
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,668
all through the movie.

857
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,712
Governor tarkin,

858
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:50,215
I should've expected to find
you holding vader's leash.

859
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:53,718
I recognized your foul stench
when I was brought onboard.

860
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:56,596
( Laughter )

861
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,934
<i>( Applause )</i>

862
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:04,854
And all my friends
made fun of me

863
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:08,066
because they said that
the title of the film

864
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,068
sounded like a fight

865
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,320
between my original parents...

866
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:15,907
"star wars."

869
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:29,462
Well, i... you know.

870
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:31,381
Well, but here's the thing...

871
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:34,259
As you age, it's about dignity.

872
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:36,427
You know what I mean?

873
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:39,555
This is what you have
to look forward to.

874
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,934
It's really unavoidable.

875
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:44,978
( Chuckles )

876
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,480
George Lucas ruined my life.

877
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:51,901
I mean that in the nicest
possible way.

878
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:55,863
And now people are
still asking me

879
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,032
if I knew "star wars"
was gonna be

880
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:00,451
that big of a hit.

881
00:43:00,537 --> 00:43:02,370
Yes.

882
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:04,163
I knew.

883
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,541
We all knew.

884
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,501
The only one who didn't know

885
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:10,545
was George Lucas.

886
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,755
We kept it from him

887
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:14,757
'cause we wanted to see

888
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,759
what his face looked like

889
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:19,053
when it changed expression.

890
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:22,557
And the man fooled us even then.

891
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,642
He got I.L.M.

892
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:28,021
To change his facial
expressions for him

893
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:31,024
and t.H.X. Sound

894
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:33,067
to make the noise

895
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,903
of a face changing expressions.

896
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:41,909
Now not only was this man

897
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:44,746
virtually expressionless
in those days,

898
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:48,166
but he also...
He hardly talked at all.

899
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:50,752
When I got this job,

900
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:53,546
they told me that I had
to lose 10 lbs.

901
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:58,009
Well, I weighed about
105 at the time.

902
00:43:58,053 --> 00:44:00,094
Well, no, but to be fair now,

903
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:03,097
I carried about
50 of those pounds

904
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,641
in my face.

905
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:08,936
So you know what a good
idea would be though?

906
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,397
Give me a hairstyle

907
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:13,566
that further widens

908
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:16,361
my already wide face.

909
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:22,367
But George Lucas...

910
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,035
You know, I mean, the ma...

911
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,162
He is a visionary, right?

912
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:28,164
I mean, he has transported

913
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:30,541
audiences the world over

914
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:32,460
and he's provided

915
00:44:32,504 --> 00:44:34,379
Mark and Harrison and myself

916
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:36,464
<i>with enough fan mail</i>

917
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:41,427
and even a small,
merry band of stalkers,

918
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:43,471
keeping us entertained

919
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:47,141
for the rest of our
unnatural lives.

920
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,519
No, my favorite fan story

921
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,562
actually happened last year.

922
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,606
We were doing
the show in Santa fe.

923
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:56,067
And so I go into this
rock shop one day,

924
00:44:56,111 --> 00:44:57,944
as one does,

925
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:59,946
and the guy
behind the counter goes,

926
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:02,407
"aren't you...?"
And i'm... "yeah."

927
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,868
He said, "I thought about you

928
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:08,121
every day

929
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:11,999
from when I was 12
to when I was 22."

930
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:16,045
And I said,
"every day?"

931
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:20,508
And he said,
"well, four times a day."

932
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:23,970
( Audience exclaiming,
laughing )

933
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:28,850
What am I supposed to say?
"Thank you."

934
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:31,894
But now don't forget,
George Lucas...

935
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:35,815
He was the man who made me
into a little doll...

936
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:38,651
A little doll
that my first husband

937
00:45:38,695 --> 00:45:40,987
could stick pins into

938
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:43,406
when he was annoyed with me.

939
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:46,534
Then I was a shampoo

940
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:50,288
where you could
twist off my head

941
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:53,040
and pour liquid out of my neck.

942
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:56,085
And I was a soap...

943
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:58,171
A soap which read:

944
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:00,465
"Lather up with Leia

945
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:04,260
and you'll feel like
a Princess yourself,

946
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:06,637
boys."

947
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:09,765
And, oh, I'm a stamp.

948
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:11,726
<i>Now that's really cool...</i>

949
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,769
I mean, well,
aside from the licking.

950
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:15,897
But, oh wait, do you know the...

951
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:19,734
You know those Mr. Potato
head things, right?

952
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,777
Well, they actually... they made

953
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:24,489
a star wars
Mr. Potato head line,

954
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:27,033
so you might recognize me

955
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:29,869
as Princess tater

956
00:46:29,913 --> 00:46:32,538
and my husband dick

957
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:35,291
and our daughter rehabila tater.

958
00:46:35,335 --> 00:46:37,627
But the main thing...

959
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:41,047
The main main thing
that I've been made into,

960
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:44,175
which has just...
It's enhanced my life

961
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:48,930
just enormously...

962
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:52,225
I'm a pez dispenser.

963
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:54,143
No, I am.

964
00:46:54,229 --> 00:46:55,645
<i>I am.</i>

965
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:57,980
Seriously.
No.

966
00:46:58,024 --> 00:47:00,816
And if someone offers

967
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,611
to make you
into a pez dispenser,

968
00:47:03,696 --> 00:47:05,947
do it!

969
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,657
Because it just...

970
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,742
It makes your whole life better.

971
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:12,870
I mean, really,
if you haven't been merchandised

972
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:15,248
for the last 30-plus years,

973
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:17,583
you haven't lived.

974
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:19,919
If only it were aerobic.

975
00:47:19,963 --> 00:47:24,257
Now among George's
many possessions,

976
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:27,593
the man owns my likeness.

977
00:47:27,637 --> 00:47:30,888
So every time I look in a mirror

978
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:34,350
I have to send him
a couple of bucks.

979
00:47:34,394 --> 00:47:35,977
You know, they...

980
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,896
I saw this other
Leia figurine recently

981
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,898
at, you know, one of those

982
00:47:40,942 --> 00:47:43,609
comic book conventions, right?

983
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:47,780
Which, yes, I go to
when I'm lonely.

984
00:47:47,824 --> 00:47:50,491
Anyway, so this
particular figurine...

985
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:52,410
It's on a turnstile, right?

986
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:55,121
So when it gets
to a particular...

987
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:58,624
Oh, visual aids.

988
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:02,003
When it gets to a particular
place on a turnstile,

989
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:05,047
you can actually see up my dress

990
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:08,259
to my anatomically correct,

991
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:11,095
though shaved,

992
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:15,391
galaxy snatch.

993
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:18,811
I was a little taken aback
by this, you know?

994
00:48:18,855 --> 00:48:20,771
So I called George and I said,

995
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:22,732
"you know, owning my likeness

996
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:24,775
does not include

997
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,862
owning my
lagoon of mystery."

998
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,281
Oh, and do you remember
that white dress I wore

999
00:48:30,325 --> 00:48:32,700
all through the first film?

1000
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:34,660
I mean, unless you didn't
see "star wars,"

1001
00:48:34,704 --> 00:48:38,873
in which case, why are you here?

1002
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,792
So they put the dress
on me the first day.

1003
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:43,878
They bring me to George.

1004
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,921
Takes one look at me
and he says,

1005
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:48,633
"you can't wear a bra
underneath that dress."

1006
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:51,385
So I say, "why?"

1007
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,554
He says, "because

1008
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:57,099
there's no underwear
in space."

1009
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:59,143
I swear to god,

1010
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:02,563
I promise you that he said this.

1011
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:04,607
And the man said it

1012
00:49:04,651 --> 00:49:07,068
with such conviction too,
you know,

1013
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:09,445
like he'd actually
been to space,

1014
00:49:09,489 --> 00:49:11,530
looked arou...

1015
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:15,159
Didn't see any bras
or panties or briefs.

1016
00:49:15,203 --> 00:49:18,079
But, you know, clearly now...

1017
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:21,082
Clearly they have gone
as far as they can go

1018
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,250
with this whole
doll thing, right?

1019
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,586
I mean, what are they
gonna do now, you know,

1020
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,089
come up with, like,
a life-size Leia, you know,

1021
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:32,009
Stepford Leia
to render me obsolete?

1022
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:33,928
You'd go to her show.

1023
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,597
So, I mean,
at least they have not done that yet.

1024
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:38,182
And thank god.

1025
00:49:38,226 --> 00:49:40,726
Thank god they have not come up

1026
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:43,312
with a Leia sex doll, you know?

1027
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:45,815
'Cause that would be
really humiliating.

1028
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:48,859
I mean, thank god
they have not come up

1029
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:52,571
with a life-size Leia sex doll

1030
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:55,950
that they charge $800 for

1031
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,910
that you could put
in your cornfield

1032
00:49:57,954 --> 00:50:00,204
to chase away crows.

1033
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:01,831
Oh.

1034
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:04,917
Oh look.
They have.

1035
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:06,961
All right, now, you know,

1036
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,213
obviously I did know about this.

1037
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:11,590
And it actually...
You know, it has its uses.

1038
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:15,219
Because if ever anyone

1039
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:17,722
from the audience screams out,

1040
00:50:17,765 --> 00:50:21,434
"go fuck yourself, Carrie"...

1041
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:26,522
I can give it a whirl.

1042
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:30,568
Somebody has to save our skins.

1043
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:32,903
Younger Carrie:
<i>I was the prize Princess.</i>

1044
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:35,531
<i>I swear, by the time I'm 30</i>

1045
00:50:35,575 --> 00:50:37,616
I'll get those braids
off my head somehow.

1046
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:40,703
Man:
<i>T-minus five,</i>

1047
00:50:40,747 --> 00:50:42,997
<i>four, three,</i>

1048
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,874
<i>two, one.</i>

1049
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:46,375
Photographers:
<i>Carrie! Carrie!</i>

1050
00:50:46,419 --> 00:50:48,502
Carrie:
<i>I want it to stop.</i>

1051
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:52,715
Recently I googled myself

1052
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:54,967
without a lubricant.

1053
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:57,762
And...

1054
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:01,015
Which I do not recommend, okay?

1055
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:05,519
And I came across this posting

1056
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:08,314
that somebody made about me.

1057
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:10,316
And it said,

1058
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:13,068
"whatever hap...?"

1059
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:14,779
Well,

1060
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:19,450
"w-t-f happened
to Carrie Fisher?

1061
00:51:19,494 --> 00:51:22,703
She used to be so hot.

1062
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:26,999
Now she looks
like Elton John."

1063
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:31,629
Well, you know,

1064
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:35,466
this hurt all seven
of my feelings,

1065
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:38,636
partly because I knew
what he meant.

1066
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:41,055
But, you know, the thing is

1067
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,140
I was hot

1068
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:46,143
when most people
are hot, you know...

1069
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:48,896
Like in their 20s and 30s.

1070
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:53,067
I did not realize

1071
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,946
that when I donned that
fricking metal bikini

1072
00:51:56,989 --> 00:52:00,366
back when I was 23,

1073
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:03,160
<i>that I had made
an invisible contract</i>

1074
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:07,414
<i>to stay looking
the exact same way</i>

1075
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:13,295
<i>for the next 30 to 40 years.</i>

1076
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:16,340
Well, obviously
I've betrayed the contract.

1077
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:20,219
Over the past
couple years actually

1078
00:52:20,263 --> 00:52:22,263
I have been having

1079
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:25,599
a series
of e.C.T. Treatments.

1080
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:27,518
Does anyone know what that is?

1081
00:52:27,562 --> 00:52:29,144
'Cause they wouldn't tell me.

1082
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:31,272
What is it?

1083
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:32,857
What?

1084
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,942
Man:
<i>Electroshock therapy.</i>

1085
00:52:34,986 --> 00:52:36,944
( Laughs )
Electroshock th...

1086
00:52:36,988 --> 00:52:38,988
Why would they give that to me?

1087
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:42,408
That's just... well, all right.

1088
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:45,077
Did you see "one flew
over the cuckoo's nest"?

1089
00:52:45,121 --> 00:52:49,206
Wasn't I fantastic?

1090
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:52,918
No, it is not like that anymore.

1091
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:57,256
It isn't, really.
I mean, now it's really fun.

1092
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,383
And I totally recommend it.

1093
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:02,094
You know, if there's,
like, an overcast day,

1094
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:04,346
no new movies out,

1095
00:53:04,432 --> 00:53:06,640
do it!

1096
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:09,018
Seriously, I mean, it takes away

1097
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:11,437
every vestige of depression.

1098
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,272
It gets you totally
off your back.

1099
00:53:13,316 --> 00:53:15,274
Here's... the other thing is

1100
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:17,026
there's no convulsions anymore.

1101
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:18,694
They give you this medication.

1102
00:53:18,738 --> 00:53:22,781
Probably they could
call it e.T.

1103
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:25,075
But that would be
really silly, wouldn't it?

1104
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,328
Because then if I said

1105
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:30,039
I had e.T.
Earlier in the week,

1106
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:34,001
you'd think I fucked
an extraterrestrial...

1107
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:36,045
Especially me.

1108
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:38,672
Uh, no, but...

1109
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:40,799
The thing is though,
like I said,

1110
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:43,844
it is... really, it is fantastic.

1111
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:48,515
However, there is a tiny
tiny little downside.

1112
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,435
Along with the depression,

1113
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:54,813
it takes a teeny doggy bag

1114
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:58,025
of about four months of memory.

1115
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:01,946
Worth it!

1116
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:04,114
What is gonna happen to me

1117
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:06,700
in one four months at my age

1118
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:09,411
that can't happen
in another four?

1119
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:12,873
Now I tell you this because

1120
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:16,585
if at any point during
the upcoming festivities

1121
00:54:16,629 --> 00:54:19,421
I draw a blank...

1122
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:22,299
Which is a contradiction
in terms, by the way,

1123
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:23,717
if you think about it...

1124
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:26,428
Then, you know, forgive me

1125
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:28,597
or don't forgive me.

1126
00:54:28,641 --> 00:54:31,016
But at least you'll
understand what's happening.

1127
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:34,561
Which is more than
I can frequently say.

1128
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:37,189
Okay, we've gotten
through all that.

1129
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:40,985
All right, so now

1130
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:43,028
every so often

1131
00:54:43,072 --> 00:54:46,532
you meet a magic person.

1132
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:49,910
And that's really... that is
how I felt when I met Paul.

1133
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:53,122
♪ I'm sitting
in the railway station ♪

1134
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:56,458
♪ got a ticket
for my destination... ♪

1135
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:59,336
<i>we had the secret handshake</i>

1136
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:02,589
<i>of shared sensibility.
You know what I mean?</i>

1137
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:05,384
<i>I mean, we understood
each other perfectly.</i>

1138
00:55:05,428 --> 00:55:07,428
You know, Paul and i...

1139
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,847
We were actually
together over 12 years...

1140
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:12,057
Well, off and on.

1141
00:55:12,101 --> 00:55:15,602
And so, you know,
we traveled a lot together,

1142
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:18,647
and he did his Simon and
garfunkeling and stuff.

1143
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:20,691
And Paul... he wrote an album

1144
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:23,235
based on south American music.

1145
00:55:23,279 --> 00:55:26,488
And that album was called
"the rhythm of the saints."

1146
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:29,241
And on it was the last song

1147
00:55:29,285 --> 00:55:31,785
that Paul ever wrote about me.

1148
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:35,664
Now if you can get Paul

1149
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:38,000
to write a song about you,

1150
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:41,128
do it!

1151
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:45,090
Because he is so so good at it.

1152
00:55:45,134 --> 00:55:49,094
But this song was called
"she moves on"...

1153
00:55:49,138 --> 00:55:51,513
Ironic title.

1154
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:54,141
And so there's this lyric in it

1155
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:56,310
that I wanted to share with you,

1156
00:55:56,353 --> 00:56:00,981
'cause I'm feeling kind of
a closeness now, you know?

1157
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:03,776
And that lyric is...

1158
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:06,111
"I'm afraid that I'll be taken,

1159
00:56:06,155 --> 00:56:09,490
abandoned and forsaken

1160
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:12,034
in her cold

1161
00:56:12,078 --> 00:56:16,288
coffee eyes."

1162
00:56:18,918 --> 00:56:21,543
Yeah.

1163
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:23,796
I'm a bitch.

1164
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:27,424
No, but no, wait.

1165
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:29,802
He wrote another song about me.

1166
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:33,263
And this one was called
"allergies."

1167
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:37,810
And the lyric in that was...

1168
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:41,855
"my heart is allergic
to the woman I love,

1169
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:46,318
and it's changing
the shape of my face."

1170
00:56:46,362 --> 00:56:50,823
Is that flattering?

1171
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:53,784
No, I don't think it is either.

1172
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:56,620
But my favorite album
of his though

1173
00:56:56,664 --> 00:56:58,997
is this album that's called

1174
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:01,250
"hearts and bones."

1175
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:02,626
And the title song...

1176
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:05,587
<i>( "hearts and bones" playing )</i>

1177
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:08,549
Well, it act...
It sounds a lot like this,

1178
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:10,634
but this couldn't be it,

1179
00:57:10,678 --> 00:57:13,178
'cause we didn't get
permission to use it.

1180
00:57:13,222 --> 00:57:16,723
So that would be bad,
wouldn't it?

1181
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:19,351
Oh, it would not be bad

1182
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:22,729
because, you know,
I never took any alimony from Paul.

1183
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,773
So think of it this way...

1184
00:57:24,817 --> 00:57:27,317
You're listening to my alimony.

1185
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:30,028
And lovely alimony it is.

1186
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:31,822
Oh, we got permission.
Anyway, the lyric is,

1187
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:33,949
"one and one half
wandering Jews..."

1188
00:57:33,993 --> 00:57:37,077
- <i>♪ one and one-half wandering Jews... ♪</i>
- I'm the half, from Eddie.

1189
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:40,914
- <i>♪ Returned to their natural
coasts ♪</i> - west is my natural...

1190
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:45,460
<i>♪ To resume old acquaintances
and step out occasionally ♪</i>

1191
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:49,715
<i>♪ and speculate who had been
damaged the most... ♪</i>

1192
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:52,926
who had been damaged the most.

1193
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:56,013
Guess who won that contest!

1194
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:00,392
Now I married Paul

1195
00:58:00,436 --> 00:58:02,519
when I was 26.

1196
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:06,398
And we got divorced
when I was 28.

1197
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:08,775
And at 29

1198
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:11,278
I went into rehab.

1199
00:58:11,322 --> 00:58:14,823
Now obviously not
because I needed it

1200
00:58:14,867 --> 00:58:16,909
but because...

1201
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:19,995
Well, I was doing
research for my novel

1202
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:21,788
"postcards from the edge"

1203
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:24,124
and I needed to meet
some real addicts

1204
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:26,001
and alcoholics, you know,

1205
00:58:26,045 --> 00:58:29,171
for, like, the veracity
of the novel.

1206
00:58:29,215 --> 00:58:31,089
Okay, fine.

1207
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:33,967
Yes, I am an addict.

1208
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:38,555
You know how they say religion
is the opiate of the masses?

1209
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:42,267
Well, I took masses
of opiates religiously.

1210
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:45,979
Now I wanted to write a book.

1211
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:50,150
And I knew what the first
line would be:

1212
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:52,152
"Maybe I shouldn't have given

1213
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:54,112
the guy who pumped my stomach

1214
00:58:54,156 --> 00:58:56,281
my phone number,

1215
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:59,159
but he'll probably
never call me anyway."

1216
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:02,913
And this actually was
based on a true thing.

1217
00:59:02,957 --> 00:59:05,332
Suzanne, we're gonna have
to pump your stomach!

1218
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:08,126
( Moans )

1219
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:10,671
<i>'Cause, see, the doctor
that pumped my stomach</i>

1220
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,756
<i>sent me flowers</i>

1221
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,300
with a note which read:

1222
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:18,595
<i>"I can tell that you're
a very warm</i>

1223
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:21,515
<i>and sensitive person."</i>

1224
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:24,726
They're from the guy
who pumped my stomach.

1225
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:28,563
I wrote "postcards from the
edge," the book, the novel,

1226
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:31,817
when I was, like,
28 or 29 in Los Angeles.

1227
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:34,861
Then I got back together
with Paul again.

1228
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:39,700
So I wrote the screenplay
of "postcards" in New York.

1229
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:42,661
Then they start filming
the movie in L.A.

1230
00:59:42,705 --> 00:59:45,080
With Meryl Streep
and Shirley MacLaine.

1231
00:59:45,124 --> 00:59:47,499
I want to be on that set, right?

1232
00:59:47,543 --> 00:59:50,335
So I start traveling
out to L.A.

1233
00:59:50,379 --> 00:59:53,171
From New York a lot.

1234
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:56,925
And this was really bad

1235
00:59:56,969 --> 00:59:59,720
for my relationship with Paul.

1236
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:02,431
I mean, things were
getting worse

1237
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:05,726
faster than we could
lower our standards.

1238
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:08,603
I...

1239
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:11,565
Pretty soon we did know
that it was over.

1240
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,192
Mike Nichols actually
used to say about us

1241
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:18,822
that we were two flowers,
no gardener.

1242
01:00:18,866 --> 01:00:21,742
No one was minding
the relationship.

1243
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:24,161
So one of the last times

1244
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:26,997
I was flying back out
to L.A. again, right?

1245
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:30,042
And so Paul and I had
been fighting all morning.

1246
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:32,502
He drives me to the airport

1247
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:34,588
to get rid of me faster.

1248
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,965
And I'm about to get
on the plane, right?

1249
01:00:37,009 --> 01:00:39,509
So I turn to him and I say,

1250
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:43,680
"you'll feel bad
if I crash."

1251
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:46,058
And he said,
"maybe not."

1252
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:50,687
( Laughs )

1253
01:00:50,773 --> 01:00:52,814
So...

1254
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:56,068
Paul and I went
our respective ways.

1255
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:58,945
And he went on to marry
someone younger than himself...

1256
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:00,697
Edie brickell from the south.

1257
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:03,867
So, not to be outdone,

1258
01:01:03,911 --> 01:01:06,787
I married someone
younger than myself...

1259
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:10,165
Bryan lourd,
also from the south.

1260
01:01:10,209 --> 01:01:12,000
Now...

1261
01:01:12,044 --> 01:01:15,379
The difference
between our choices...

1262
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:17,381
My choice forgot to tell me

1263
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:19,841
that he was gay.

1264
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:23,136
Well, he forgot to tell me

1265
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,263
and I forgot to notice.

1266
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:27,265
Really, though later on Bryan...

1267
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:29,559
He did... he explained to me

1268
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:35,440
that I had turned him gay

1269
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:38,235
by taking codeine again.

1270
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:40,237
And I said, "you know,

1271
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,322
I never read that warning

1272
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:44,574
on the label.

1273
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:47,661
I thought it said
'heavy machinery, '

1274
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,622
not 'homosexuality.'

1275
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:52,624
I could have been driving

1276
01:01:52,668 --> 01:01:56,169
those tractors
all along."

1277
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:58,964
Turning people gay though...

1278
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:02,884
It is kind of
a superpower of mine.

1279
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:07,139
Admittedly no, it is not
called upon a lot.

1280
01:02:07,182 --> 01:02:09,975
But when it is,

1281
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:12,519
I pick up my pink phone,

1282
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:15,355
I put on my
rainbow-colored cape,

1283
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:18,775
and I'm there like a shot.

1284
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:20,652
Now, you know,

1285
01:02:20,696 --> 01:02:23,822
I was probably rebounding
from Paul a little bit

1286
01:02:23,866 --> 01:02:27,242
when I met Bryan a week later.

1287
01:02:27,286 --> 01:02:30,203
But Bryan though...

1288
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:33,039
Bryan, he was really
really handsome.

1289
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:36,001
Well, he still is.
He is.

1290
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:38,712
Look, that's what
he looks like now.

1291
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:42,048
When I met him he had hair.

1292
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:45,051
I do that too.

1293
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:47,929
I make them bald,
I turn them gay...

1294
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:50,390
My work is done.

1295
01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:52,893
But, you know,

1296
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:55,395
when I first met Bryan,

1297
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:58,315
he took really good care of me.

1298
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:01,193
He took such good care
of me that I thought,

1299
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:05,113
"you know,
this guy will make a good father."

1300
01:03:05,157 --> 01:03:07,115
And he did.

1301
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:09,326
So, you know,

1302
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:13,371
fearing now that everything
would be all right,

1303
01:03:13,415 --> 01:03:17,876
nine months later my daughter
was dragged from my body

1304
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,878
as though it were
a burning building.

1305
01:03:19,922 --> 01:03:24,549
And once this well-fed,
round creature

1306
01:03:24,593 --> 01:03:27,552
was rescued from
the rubble of me,

1307
01:03:27,596 --> 01:03:30,222
I sent out birth announcements

1308
01:03:30,265 --> 01:03:32,474
which read:

1309
01:03:32,518 --> 01:03:35,101
"Someone summered in my stomach,

1310
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:37,354
someone's fallen
through my legs.

1311
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:39,523
To make an infant omelet,

1312
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:42,817
simply scramble
sperm and eggs."

1313
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:45,487
Thank you.

1314
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:52,410
We named our adorable
little omelet Billie...

1315
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:54,663
Billie Catherine.

1316
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:56,915
So, you know,

1317
01:03:56,959 --> 01:03:59,417
a year later, when Bryan left me

1318
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:01,836
for Scott,

1319
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:06,091
who became the man that
got the man that got away,

1320
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:10,679
all of my friends talked to me

1321
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:13,348
like their hair was
heavier on one side.

1322
01:04:13,392 --> 01:04:15,016
You know what I mean?

1323
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,727
How are you doing?

1324
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:21,982
Are you okay?

1325
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:24,985
But my mother though...

1326
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:27,070
My mother was...

1327
01:04:27,114 --> 01:04:29,322
She was awesome to me
during this time.

1328
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:32,033
She really was.
I mean, my mother...

1329
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:35,829
Well, obviously she's
like a mother to me.

1330
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:39,249
But... no, but she said
this fantastic thing.

1331
01:04:39,293 --> 01:04:41,543
She said, "you know, dear,

1332
01:04:41,587 --> 01:04:45,547
we've had all sorts of men
in our family.

1333
01:04:45,591 --> 01:04:47,591
We've had horse thieves

1334
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:51,595
and one-man bands
and alcoholics.

1335
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:56,308
But this is
our first homosexual."

1336
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,604
Now, you know,

1337
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:04,316
having really absolutely
nothing at all whatsoever

1338
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:06,860
to do with Bryan,

1339
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,903
about...

1340
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:12,240
About a year after this

1341
01:05:12,284 --> 01:05:14,743
I was invited

1342
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:17,203
to go to a mental hospital.

1343
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:21,207
And...

1344
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:25,253
Well, you don't want
to be rude, right?

1345
01:05:25,297 --> 01:05:27,714
So you go.

1346
01:05:27,758 --> 01:05:30,717
Well, wait a...
Wait a second now.

1347
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:35,221
It's a really really
exclusive invitation.

1348
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:37,432
I mean, how many of you

1349
01:05:37,476 --> 01:05:42,354
have been invited
to a mental hospital?

1350
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:45,815
I'm asking you for real.

1351
01:05:47,319 --> 01:05:49,319
One human.

1352
01:05:49,363 --> 01:05:51,988
What's your name?

1353
01:05:52,032 --> 01:05:54,574
- Jimmy.
- Jimmy.

1354
01:05:54,618 --> 01:05:57,786
I told you though,
it's very exclusive...

1355
01:05:57,829 --> 01:06:01,581
Just Jimmy and myself.

1356
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:03,667
Oh.

1357
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:06,044
My mother wants you all to know

1358
01:06:06,088 --> 01:06:08,630
this comes from my father's side

1359
01:06:08,674 --> 01:06:11,675
of the family.

1360
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:14,010
She is as normal

1361
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:16,805
as the day is long.

1362
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:19,307
Now my diagnosis...

1363
01:06:19,351 --> 01:06:21,351
I know this will stun you...

1364
01:06:21,395 --> 01:06:23,395
Was manic depression.

1365
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:25,772
I think now they call it
bipolar, right?

1366
01:06:25,816 --> 01:06:28,900
So you might say
I swing both ways.

1367
01:06:28,944 --> 01:06:31,277
Oh, wait wait.

1368
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:33,238
Now this is really
gonna impress you:

1369
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:35,907
I am actually

1370
01:06:35,951 --> 01:06:40,704
in the abnormal
psychology textbook.

1371
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:43,206
- Come on, how cool is that?
- <i>( Applause )</i>

1372
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:45,792
No, wait wait wait
wait wait wait wait.

1373
01:06:45,836 --> 01:06:48,044
Keep in mind,

1374
01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:51,047
I am a pez dispenser

1375
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:56,678
and I'm in the abnormal
psychology textbook!

1376
01:06:56,722 --> 01:06:58,722
( Applause )

1377
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:02,851
Who says you can't have it all?

1378
01:07:02,894 --> 01:07:06,479
Now, you know, obviously
my family's so proud,

1379
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:08,523
but the thing is

1380
01:07:08,567 --> 01:07:11,151
I heard that I was
in this textbook

1381
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:14,028
and I heard I was
in there with a picture.

1382
01:07:14,072 --> 01:07:17,866
And I thought,
"what picture?"

1383
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:20,869
You know, it's not like anyone
ever phoned me and said,

1384
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:23,329
"have you got a little
snapshot of yourself

1385
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:25,290
looking depressed

1386
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:27,375
or manic?"

1387
01:07:27,419 --> 01:07:29,335
You know, like from this show.

1388
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:32,589
And, you know,
rather than describe it to you,

1389
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:36,426
I so badly want
to show it to you.

1390
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:38,970
<i>( Laughter )</i>

1391
01:07:39,014 --> 01:07:43,266
No, it's true.

1392
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:45,143
It's real.

1393
01:07:45,187 --> 01:07:47,145
So I'm not crazy.

1394
01:07:47,189 --> 01:07:50,857
That bitch is.

1395
01:07:50,901 --> 01:07:52,901
Anyone that would wear

1396
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:55,945
a stupid hairstyle like that

1397
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:57,989
has to be nuts.

1398
01:07:58,033 --> 01:08:00,325
Now I have two moods

1399
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:03,620
that I've named Roy and Pam.

1400
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:07,373
Now Roy is rollicking Roy,

1401
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:09,709
the wild ride of a mood.

1402
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:11,753
And Pam...

1403
01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:14,339
Pam is sediment Pam

1404
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:18,635
who stands on the shore
and sobs.

1405
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:21,221
One mood is the meal,

1406
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:24,557
the next mood... the check.

1407
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:28,937
Ever since my
fateful announcement

1408
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:31,564
on "Diane Sawyer"
that I was mentally ill...

1409
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:34,984
I went into this other place.

1410
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:37,111
And I was hallucinating.

1411
01:08:37,155 --> 01:08:40,156
Like anyone needed
to know that, right?

1412
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,909
I could see cities of the...

1413
01:08:42,953 --> 01:08:45,286
Futuristic cities
out the window.

1414
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:48,206
I mean, don't you hate it

1415
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:52,794
when celebrities just...
Blah blah blah...

1416
01:08:52,838 --> 01:08:55,588
Talk about themselves,
you know...

1417
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:59,092
It was as though
you could feel the back

1418
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:02,971
of the cool of the mood
with your hand.

1419
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:05,765
Tell you everything?

1420
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:08,101
I mean, who asked, right?

1421
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:12,480
I just... I find it all
so wearying.

1422
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:19,737
Actually, that is
my point of view.

1423
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:23,074
That's why what you're
watching right now

1424
01:09:23,118 --> 01:09:26,578
is me talk about myself
behind my back.

1425
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:29,289
Now if Carrie...

1426
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:32,000
If Carrie ever found out

1427
01:09:32,043 --> 01:09:35,670
that Carrie Fisher is doing

1428
01:09:35,714 --> 01:09:41,050
a solipsistic,
people-pleasing show like this,

1429
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:45,346
she would be so humiliated.

1430
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:47,348
So, please, if you run into her,

1431
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:51,185
( whispers )
Don't say anything.

1432
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:54,939
Anyway, having waited
my entire life

1433
01:09:54,983 --> 01:09:56,941
to get an award for something...

1434
01:09:56,985 --> 01:09:58,693
You know, anything.
I don't care.

1435
01:09:58,737 --> 01:10:00,904
Okay fine, not acting.

1436
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:03,823
What about a teeny one
for writing?

1437
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:09,245
I now get awards all the time

1438
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:11,831
for being mentally ill.

1439
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:13,207
No, really.

1440
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:15,668
I am apparently
very very good at it

1441
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:18,588
and I get honored
for it regularly.

1442
01:10:18,632 --> 01:10:21,591
My daughter... she tells me
when she grows up

1443
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:24,552
she wants to either be
a singer or a comic.

1444
01:10:24,596 --> 01:10:27,805
I said, "well, baby,
if you want to be a comic,

1445
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:29,807
you gotta be a writer.

1446
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:31,851
But don't worry.

1447
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:34,979
You have got tons of material.

1448
01:10:35,023 --> 01:10:38,274
Your mother is a
manic-depressive drug addict,

1449
01:10:38,318 --> 01:10:39,817
your father is gay,

1450
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:41,903
your grandmother tap dances

1451
01:10:41,947 --> 01:10:46,491
and your grandfather
eats hearing aids."

1452
01:10:46,534 --> 01:10:48,952
And my daughter

1453
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:53,331
laughs and laughs and laughs.

1454
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:55,667
And I said, "baby,

1455
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:58,878
the fact that you know
that's funny

1456
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:02,507
is gonna save
your whole life."

1457
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:03,800
Yeah.

1458
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:08,221
Location location location.

1459
01:11:10,225 --> 01:11:14,602
Now I heard someone say recently

1460
01:11:14,646 --> 01:11:17,438
that many of us

1461
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:20,817
only seem able to find heaven

1462
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:23,820
by backing away from hell.

1463
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:25,947
And, you know,

1464
01:11:25,991 --> 01:11:28,783
while the place I've
arrived at in my life

1465
01:11:28,827 --> 01:11:33,579
isn't precisely everyone's
idea of heavenly,

1466
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:36,666
I could swear sometimes,

1467
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:39,168
if I'm quiet enough...

1468
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:45,508
I can hear the angels sing.

1469
01:11:47,137 --> 01:11:50,304
Either that or I fucked
up my medication.

1470
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:52,140
But...

1471
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:54,434
<i>( siren wailing )</i>

1472
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:57,145
Shit, there's my ride.

1473
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:59,897
Before I go though

1474
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:02,400
I wanted to share with you
some of the wisdoms

1475
01:12:02,444 --> 01:12:04,402
that I have acquired, you know,

1476
01:12:04,446 --> 01:12:07,488
from going through
all this shit, okay?

1477
01:12:07,532 --> 01:12:09,699
First one...

1478
01:12:09,743 --> 01:12:13,828
Resentment is like
drinking a poison

1479
01:12:13,872 --> 01:12:18,166
and waiting for the other
person to die.

1480
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:21,252
Now some of the wisdoms
that I have

1481
01:12:21,296 --> 01:12:22,962
I got from my grandmother...

1482
01:12:23,006 --> 01:12:25,298
My mother's mother,
the closet locker...

1483
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:28,009
Who taught me

1484
01:12:28,053 --> 01:12:30,970
a fly is as likely

1485
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:33,431
to land on shit

1486
01:12:33,475 --> 01:12:35,933
as it is on pie.

1487
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:39,979
That's true.

1488
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:43,483
( Laughs )

1489
01:12:45,737 --> 01:12:48,279
She also said,

1490
01:12:48,323 --> 01:12:50,281
"cry all you want.

1491
01:12:50,325 --> 01:12:52,158
You'll pee less."
