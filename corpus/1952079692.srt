1
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,983
<i>Was in Tora Bora 2001,</i>

2
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,380
<i>... military missed him.</i>

3
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:58,422
<i>Plans of clearing up this war in Iraq are-</i>

4
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:01,261
<i>Anything other than war is hell.</i>

5
00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:03,817
<i>I'd say, "Yes, Bill,
It does mean something</i>

6
00:01:03,818 --> 00:01:06,318
<i>to the soldiers injured
and killed and their familles.</i>

7
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,829
<i>... and they're parading things in</i>

8
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,508
<i>to try to get public opinion
to shift against it.</i>

9
00:01:16,836 --> 00:01:19,336
<i>The point is Iraq started before Halliburton.</i>

10
00:01:19,502 --> 00:01:21,303
<i>This goes back
to the Kissinger era,</i>

11
00:01:21,304 --> 00:01:23,804
<i>and is just now bearing
fruit for a lot of these guys.</i>

12
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:26,142
<i>It's not just
U. S. military over there.</i>

13
00:01:26,143 --> 00:01:28,376
<i>It's Black Water,
Triple Canopy,</i>

14
00:01:28,377 --> 00:01:31,759
<i>in what thousands of special ops
we're never going to know.</i>

15
00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:35,360
<i>Redesign of the conduct of the war.</i>

16
00:01:35,687 --> 00:01:38,793
<i>This has been confirmed.
It is expected that-</i>

17
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,093
<i>We are convinced</i>

18
00:01:44,094 --> 00:01:46,594
<i>that it was necessary
and righteous-</i>

19
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,425
<i>I'd like to begin
with an apology.</i>

20
00:02:03,753 --> 00:02:08,093
<i>Obviously, we all have better
ways of bringing in the new year.</i>

21
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,956
Well, everyone-
except you, Denise.

22
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,571
<i>This time last week,</i>

23
00:02:20,664 --> 00:02:22,897
<i>on Christmas Eve,</i>

24
00:02:22,898 --> 00:02:25,099
<i>our Department received
intelligence reports</i>

25
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,382
<i>Indicating the whereabouts
of the Ace of Spades.</i>

26
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,788
Three brave
American soldiers

27
00:02:34,115 --> 00:02:36,615
acted on that
intelligence and killed him.

28
00:02:36,913 --> 00:02:39,413
Excuse me.

29
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,832
However, it is with great
sadness that I report to you

30
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,436
that the soldiers involved
in that operation

31
00:02:51,763 --> 00:02:53,796
all lost their
lives in it.

32
00:02:53,797 --> 00:02:57,678
Now I'm not at liberty
to release their names at this time,

33
00:02:58,005 --> 00:03:00,615
but I ask every
American to please

34
00:03:00,942 --> 00:03:03,483
keep these three heroes
in their prayers this evening.

35
00:03:03,811 --> 00:03:08,687
Now this, this is not an end to
the war on terror.

36
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:11,515
We fear it may
merely be a new beginning.

37
00:03:11,797 --> 00:03:15,931
As a result, we have raised the
threat level effective immediately.

38
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:20,599
Now the President and Vice President
will return from holiday on Tuesday.

39
00:03:20,926 --> 00:03:25,203
They've asked your networks
for one hour on Thursday to brief the nation.

40
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,075
Any questions you have
will be answered at that time.

41
00:03:28,402 --> 00:03:33,380
Now, as we-as we
enter the New Year,

42
00:03:33,707 --> 00:03:37,015
let us pray
that this will be the year

43
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:39,988
that sees an end
to global tyranny,

44
00:03:40,316 --> 00:03:42,643
and delivers world peace.

45
00:03:42,644 --> 00:03:45,144
I bid you all a good night,

46
00:03:45,148 --> 00:03:46,915
a Happy New Year,

47
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,416
and God bless the
United States of America.

48
00:03:49,725 --> 00:03:51,288
Thank you.

49
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:53,789
Mr. Secretary!

50
00:03:54,062 --> 00:03:56,322
As was stated,

51
00:03:56,323 --> 00:03:58,391
<i>the President gets
back on Tuesday,</i>

52
00:03:58,392 --> 00:04:00,527
and will address
the nation on Thursday.

53
00:04:00,528 --> 00:04:03,028
Sir.
Sir!

54
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,209
He popped up.

55
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,773
Excuse me?

56
00:04:13,774 --> 00:04:15,144
He popped up.

57
00:04:15,145 --> 00:04:16,208
When?

58
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,411
About an hour ago.

59
00:04:17,412 --> 00:04:19,113
Oh, Christ.

60
00:04:19,114 --> 00:04:23,030
It came from Texas.
We thought it would affect your statement.

61
00:04:23,358 --> 00:04:25,523
And?

62
00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:27,789
They've washed their hands, sir.

63
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,502
They've said it's
time for you to clean it.

64
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:32,895
Now why do you
look so pleased?

65
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:34,629
Where?

66
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,477
On a bus.
From New York to Washington.

67
00:04:37,805 --> 00:04:40,305
Hm.

68
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,339
You believe
in him, don't you?

69
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,020
No, the luxury
of believing in any one man

70
00:04:49,348 --> 00:04:52,528
has a price tag
someone like me cannot afford.

71
00:04:52,855 --> 00:04:54,614
But-

72
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:57,897
I believe that we trained
a man without moral conviction,

73
00:04:58,224 --> 00:05:00,689
devoid of reason.

74
00:05:00,724 --> 00:05:03,059
Given that, it makes
it far more serious.

75
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,706
Question: What becomes
of a highly trained, motivated murderer

76
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:11,477
who sprouts a conscience?

77
00:05:11,805 --> 00:05:13,201
Infamy?

78
00:05:13,202 --> 00:05:16,049
Mm, to some, perhaps.

79
00:05:16,377 --> 00:05:18,877
But perhaps
he becomes something else

80
00:05:19,074 --> 00:05:23,423
to those in
Texas, to me, to his country,

81
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:26,861
with what he's seen,
what he's heard, what he thinks he knows,

82
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:29,689
he becomes
something far worse.

83
00:05:29,885 --> 00:05:31,956
Which is?

84
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,457
A fire, if you will,

85
00:05:34,763 --> 00:05:37,704
that neither
you nor I can extinguish.

86
00:05:38,031 --> 00:05:41,101
He becomes a legend.

87
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,667
Who's on the bus?

88
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:49,538
Seven and Eleven.

89
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:52,039
Oh, isn't that cute.

90
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:54,854
Irony, sir.
It's what gets me through the day.

91
00:05:55,181 --> 00:06:00,362
Phone Seven.
Tell him to tag him.

92
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,184
Sir?

93
00:06:02,185 --> 00:06:04,053
If he kills him, then what?

94
00:06:04,054 --> 00:06:06,554
Right now, he's just
a whisper in the wind.

95
00:06:06,795 --> 00:06:10,871
They die, his voice
can only get louder.

96
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,743
We have the luxury
of position and time.

97
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,570
He does not.

98
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:42,468
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention please.

99
00:06:42,796 --> 00:06:45,296
Special Agent Robinson.

100
00:06:45,544 --> 00:06:48,976
I don't mean to disturb
you but I'm conducting a test, a drill,

101
00:06:49,303 --> 00:06:51,665
for the Department
of Homeland Security.

102
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,166
Now nothing is wrong.
This is simply a drill.

103
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:58,215
Now that we've arrived
in Washington D.C.,

104
00:06:58,445 --> 00:07:01,956
I need to see how quickly
you can exit the bus.

105
00:07:02,284 --> 00:07:04,784
The cost of your tickets
will be refunded.

106
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:07,828
My goal is to find
out if this was a real emergency,

107
00:07:08,155 --> 00:07:10,655
how long it would take.

108
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,669
It starts...

109
00:07:17,996 --> 00:07:19,528
now.

110
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:20,626
<i>Let's go, folks.</i>

111
00:07:20,627 --> 00:07:23,127
<i>Sit.</i>

112
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,305
<i>... missed him.
In clearing up this war in Iraq-</i>

113
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:54,562
Ace of Spades.

114
00:07:54,563 --> 00:07:56,899
What'd you just say?

115
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,400
<i>Ace of Spades.</i>

116
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,046
Seeing is believing, my friend.

117
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:04,704
Why is it always him?

118
00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:07,205
It's in English, Sanchez.

119
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,520
<i>Rastrero.</i>

120
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:14,261
Northern Pakistan.

121
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:16,917
It's too obvious.
I don't like it.

122
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:18,720
Well, you don't like anything.

123
00:08:18,721 --> 00:08:19,988
Just give me the odds.

124
00:08:19,989 --> 00:08:24,169
Two to four.

125
00:08:24,496 --> 00:08:26,996
Keep reading.

126
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:32,111
So Junior says
fifty fifty, my hombre.

127
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:34,939
You know,
a wise man once said,

128
00:08:35,122 --> 00:08:37,622
"Knowing oneself and
knowing the enemy,

129
00:08:37,912 --> 00:08:40,650
"in every battle,
certain victory.

130
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:44,457
"Knowing oneself,
not knowing the enemy,

131
00:08:44,784 --> 00:08:47,496
"one victory for one loss.

132
00:08:47,823 --> 00:08:50,323
"But not knowing oneself,

133
00:08:50,505 --> 00:08:52,956
"and not knowing the enemy,

134
00:08:52,957 --> 00:08:56,870
in every battle,
certain defeat. "

135
00:08:57,198 --> 00:08:59,160
Who was it?

136
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:01,999
<i>Sun Tzu, The Art of War.</i>

137
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,911
These days I say fifty fifty.

138
00:09:08,222 --> 00:09:10,340
An eye for an eye.

139
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,841
<i>It's about
as good as it's gonna get.</i>

140
00:09:13,013 --> 00:09:15,615
The call came out
for heroes, boys.

141
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,424
The three wise men on high,

142
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,170
smelled, touched, saw,

143
00:09:23,457 --> 00:09:26,134
and came to the conclusion
of whom they should call.

144
00:09:26,462 --> 00:09:28,389
<i>I say we send
out a message telling</i>

145
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,158
the children to
cover their eyes,

146
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,696
the women to
shut their legs,

147
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:33,428
and the men to put
up their fists,

148
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:35,929
because a war
machine is coming.

149
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,610
<i>We roll in 55
minutes, gentlemen.</i>

150
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,917
Let's burn
this shit hole down.

151
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,482
Merry fucking Christmas.

152
00:09:51,483 --> 00:09:56,329
<i>Plans for carrying out this war in Iraq-</i>

153
00:09:56,657 --> 00:10:00,090
Look, we're
just doing our job, alright?

154
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:05,001
<i>I don't know
what you did, I don't care.</i>

155
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:11,874
<i>No, not yet.</i>

156
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,590
Now if you want
to live, then stay off the grid.

157
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,692
Where's my cash?

158
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:31,795
Just give me the location of
my box and then I go away.

159
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,067
Choice one:
what's done is done.

160
00:10:37,378 --> 00:10:39,395
If I were you,
I'd make like a tree.

161
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:43,243
<i>If not, go through door
number two and open the envelope.</i>

162
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,902
<i>Either road you choose,
I'd find a way to stay lost.</i>

163
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,850
Hey.

164
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:38,351
<i>Good evening.</i>

165
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,549
Hey, Samir,
a little heat back here?

166
00:11:59,796 --> 00:12:04,623
It depends. Good tip?

167
00:12:04,951 --> 00:12:07,151
Where to?

168
00:12:07,152 --> 00:12:09,996
Two stops.
First, the Mayflower.

169
00:12:10,324 --> 00:12:13,563
Hey, I'm hip.

170
00:12:13,891 --> 00:12:16,358
Have fun.
Take your time.

171
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:18,159
They have the
best girls in town.

172
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,660
I say nothing.

173
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,812
<i>Take the access road
and park in the alley.</i>

174
00:12:38,813 --> 00:12:41,313
<i>Keep it running.</i>

175
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:58,277
Don't kill the lights.
In 10 minutes, pull the car around front.

176
00:12:58,605 --> 00:13:01,446
Please don't
take another fare.

177
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,882
Just a quickie?

178
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,765
Club soda.
Dry.

179
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:15,321
<i>But the point is
Iraq started before Halliburton.</i>

180
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:17,578
<i>This goes back to
the Kissinger era,</i>

181
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:20,079
<i>and is just now bearing fruit
for a lot of these guys.</i>

182
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,518
<i>It's not just
U. S. military over there.</i>

183
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:24,820
<i>It's Black Water,
Triple Canopy,</i>

184
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:27,988
<i>in what thousands
of special ops.</i>

185
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,721
What can I get you?

186
00:15:02,722 --> 00:15:05,222
I'll have a club soda. Dry.

187
00:15:05,432 --> 00:15:10,173
<i>A Club Soda, no-no vodka, or-</i>

188
00:15:10,501 --> 00:15:12,968
I can't help you with that.

189
00:15:12,969 --> 00:15:17,047
Those are the rules, cowboy. If you have
a problem with it, you can talk to him.

190
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,415
I'll have
a bourbon on the rocks.

191
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,916
That I can do.

192
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,562
Weird, don't you think?

193
00:16:13,563 --> 00:16:16,606
He sat there
the whole night watching you,

194
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:19,580
doesn't order anything.
And then at closing time he comes up,

195
00:16:19,908 --> 00:16:22,550
orders one drink and leaves.

196
00:16:22,877 --> 00:16:25,377
Looks like you may
have your first male crush.

197
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,843
I don't get you.

198
00:16:55,844 --> 00:16:57,536
How come?

199
00:16:57,537 --> 00:17:02,388
Well, you sat there
all night with some creepy gay guy

200
00:17:02,716 --> 00:17:05,216
clearly watching you,
you don't say a word,

201
00:17:05,514 --> 00:17:07,246
you don't look at the stage,

202
00:17:07,247 --> 00:17:09,747
and worst of all,
you haven't even looked at me.

203
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:12,251
I'm looking at you now.

204
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,759
Buy me another?

205
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,260
Of course.

206
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,985
Last call!

207
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:52,629
I'm a-goin' down to the cellar.
You want the box on?

208
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,885
Now you be good.

209
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:19,886
What's in the cellar?

210
00:18:19,887 --> 00:18:22,726
You don't wanna know.

211
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:28,263
Hey, Crush, it's time to go home.

212
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:02,905
Thank you.

213
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,613
Ooh.

214
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,050
So.

215
00:19:14,313 --> 00:19:16,813
What's your story, cowboy?

216
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,126
You don't wanna know.

217
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:31,193
Don't move.

218
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,913
For the next 15 minutes,
I'm gonna call you lollipop.

219
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,740
Any issues?

220
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:53,752
Okay, lollipop,
I have a very simple question.

221
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:56,375
I'm pretty sure
you know what it is.

222
00:20:56,376 --> 00:20:58,876
Where is my cash?

223
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,830
That's it, that's it,
scream all you want.

224
00:21:06,157 --> 00:21:08,657
You and I both know
no one can hear you in this room.

225
00:21:08,956 --> 00:21:12,269
And from the looks of things,

226
00:21:12,597 --> 00:21:15,473
I'm sure all I have
left in life is time

227
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,063
and the pleasure of your voice.

228
00:21:18,064 --> 00:21:20,615
Oh, come on!
I got two kids, man.

229
00:21:20,942 --> 00:21:22,734
I'll never have any.

230
00:21:22,735 --> 00:21:25,235
Now where did they hide my box?

231
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:33,055
They were wrong.

232
00:21:33,182 --> 00:21:35,584
Now ask me how come.

233
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:38,566
How come.

234
00:21:38,893 --> 00:21:40,788
It's doesn't take three licks

235
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:43,289
to get to
the center of a Tootsie Pop.

236
00:21:43,323 --> 00:21:47,003
Now please,
tell me where my cash is.

237
00:21:47,331 --> 00:21:50,843
Six-66 Benning Road, man.

238
00:21:51,171 --> 00:21:53,671
They said you'd know where.

239
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,977
Look me in the eye
and say that again.

240
00:22:03,978 --> 00:22:07,557
Sixty-six Benning Road.
That's all they told me.

241
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,135
Bring your mouth to the hole.

242
00:22:19,348 --> 00:22:20,694
Bring your mouth to the hole!!

243
00:22:20,695 --> 00:22:22,597
I can't. It'll kill me!!

244
00:22:22,598 --> 00:22:24,966
Soda water doesn't kill people.

245
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:26,469
I kill people.

246
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,168
Why?

247
00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:30,669
I had a friend once.

248
00:22:30,689 --> 00:22:33,189
She used to call me Lobo.

249
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,445
<i>How was she?</i>

250
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:06,749
Sixty-six Benning Road.

251
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,584
<i>My friend, I'm from Libya.</i>

252
00:23:14,585 --> 00:23:17,085
We play football with our feet.

253
00:23:17,185 --> 00:23:20,931
<i>I coach team.
Win six games.</i>

254
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,833
<i>How many quarterback do you need?</i>

255
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,996
<i>You're not from here.</i>

256
00:23:30,997 --> 00:23:34,279
<i>Everyone from
here, even gay, love Redskins.</i>

257
00:23:34,606 --> 00:23:37,717
<i>Oh. You're a cowboy.</i>

258
00:23:38,045 --> 00:23:40,545
<i>Hey, fuck you, 3.95, you walk.</i>

259
00:23:40,758 --> 00:23:42,813
<i>You're like me with my wife.</i>

260
00:23:42,814 --> 00:23:45,314
That's why I talk
so much at work.

261
00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:47,214
Crazy bitch.

262
00:23:47,215 --> 00:23:49,483
<i>Nobody can
get a word in edgewise.</i>

263
00:23:49,484 --> 00:23:50,953
<i>Hey, man,
I go to the movies.</i>

264
00:23:50,954 --> 00:23:53,454
I'm hip, I'm cool, I'm down.

265
00:23:53,605 --> 00:23:56,105
<i>I'll be your homeboy tonight.</i>

266
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:03,874
Let me guess. You're
a drug dealer from New York.

267
00:24:04,202 --> 00:24:06,702
<i>And that
duffel bag is full of rock.</i>

268
00:24:06,885 --> 00:24:09,613
You're going to sell
to M13. It's cool.

269
00:24:09,941 --> 00:24:12,041
Who?

270
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:14,542
Ah! He speaks.

271
00:24:14,626 --> 00:24:18,355
You know, M13.
The, how you say, gang.

272
00:24:18,682 --> 00:24:21,182
<i>The thugs.</i>

273
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:28,564
It's beautiful tonight.

274
00:24:28,691 --> 00:24:31,191
World War II memorial.

275
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:37,674
They haven't finished it.

276
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:41,581
<i>There's only one way
for a war memorial to truly be finished.</i>

277
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:44,409
Everyone dies.

278
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,711
<i>When they were planning to build,</i>

279
00:24:48,712 --> 00:24:51,658
<i>the people, they fight constantly.</i>

280
00:24:51,986 --> 00:24:54,926
"It's gonna destroy them all."

281
00:24:55,254 --> 00:25:00,699
"Put it next
to Vietnam or over by RFK."

282
00:25:01,026 --> 00:25:04,970
<i>How soon we forget
to honor the good and punish the wrong.</i>

283
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:07,728
Don't you think?

284
00:25:07,729 --> 00:25:10,745
Pull over here on the bridge.

285
00:25:11,072 --> 00:25:13,572
Right here.

286
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,999
<i>For some, it's hard to believe.</i>

287
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:45,157
What's that?

288
00:26:45,158 --> 00:26:47,658
<i>That the people back there,
they have too much.</i>

289
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:50,742
And the people,
right here, one mile away,

290
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:54,309
they have not enough.

291
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:00,249
Pull over
right here on the bridge.

292
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,628
I promised you a good tip.

293
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,136
You better go.

294
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,340
Padre Nuestro,
que estas en el cielo-

295
00:27:58,536 --> 00:28:01,036
santificado sea Tu nombre-

296
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:03,669
I think we're
all prayed out, Sanchez.

297
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:18,894
Hey!

298
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:32,174
It'd be sweet without the sour.

299
00:28:32,469 --> 00:28:36,747
<i>Nah. It wouldn't
be sour without the sweet.</i>

300
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,307
You still ain't
figured it out yet, kid.

301
00:28:41,308 --> 00:28:43,211
What's that?

302
00:28:43,212 --> 00:28:47,593
You're still young.
You got time.

303
00:28:47,921 --> 00:28:50,693
More fun
figuring it out on your own.

304
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,520
Yes and no.

305
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,442
Here we are,

306
00:29:15,443 --> 00:29:18,520
in the middle of the biggest gang
war in the history of the world.

307
00:29:18,848 --> 00:29:23,862
So I guess it wasn't
about defending Lady Liberty?

308
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,220
In the beginning.

309
00:29:26,221 --> 00:29:28,421
You and I both know, sir,

310
00:29:28,422 --> 00:29:31,466
we gave up defending
Lady Liberty a long time ago.

311
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:36,904
You know, when we
pull this off, you guys have an out.

312
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,956
Why do you think I was so smiley
when we played shoot 'n tell earlier?

313
00:29:54,275 --> 00:29:57,098
Right, then what?

314
00:29:57,425 --> 00:29:59,819
Then back to the D.C.

315
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,357
To the devil I know.

316
00:30:01,358 --> 00:30:03,858
<i>At least there,
on those streets,</i>

317
00:30:03,975 --> 00:30:06,475
I think I know
who the bad guys are.

318
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,208
What about you?

319
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,645
I don't know.

320
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:52,047
No!

321
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:36,617
<i>May I help you?</i>

322
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:41,322
Have you seen those men before?

323
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:47,396
Is that your daughter?

324
00:32:47,644 --> 00:32:50,370
What can I do for you?

325
00:32:50,698 --> 00:32:53,198
I need you to get
under the counter.

326
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,279
So,

327
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:41,407
a great general is killed
after a long battle, by his enemy's sword,

328
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,654
he gets to the gates of heaven,

329
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:50,493
he looks through and he
sees former presidents, kings and queens,

330
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,529
his parents,
seated at this long table.

331
00:33:54,857 --> 00:33:58,370
Saint Peter approaches,
introduces himself,

332
00:33:58,697 --> 00:34:00,795
the general asks
him, " How do I get in?

333
00:34:00,796 --> 00:34:03,296
How do I
walk through those gates?"

334
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:06,177
Saint Peter says,
"Well, you have to spell a word. "

335
00:34:06,505 --> 00:34:09,005
The general asks,
"What is the word?"

336
00:34:09,071 --> 00:34:11,473
St. Peter says,
"The word is 'love."'

337
00:34:11,474 --> 00:34:15,618
<i>The general spells
it and St. Peter welcomes him in.</i>

338
00:34:15,946 --> 00:34:19,458
About a year later, St. Peter
comes up to the general and says,

339
00:34:19,785 --> 00:34:22,862
"I need you to
watch the gates for me today."

340
00:34:23,189 --> 00:34:26,631
A little while later, sure enough,
he sees a man approaching,

341
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:30,137
he walks toward
the gate, so he recognizes his enemy,

342
00:34:30,464 --> 00:34:33,235
the man who killed him.

343
00:34:33,563 --> 00:34:36,805
They talk for a minute,
his enemy apologizes,

344
00:34:37,133 --> 00:34:39,678
and then he asks,
"How do I get in?"

345
00:34:40,005 --> 00:34:43,014
The general thinks
for just a second, he says,

346
00:34:43,342 --> 00:34:45,842
"You have to spell a word. "

347
00:34:45,942 --> 00:34:48,174
So the enemy asks,
"What is the word?"

348
00:34:48,175 --> 00:34:50,675
The general says
'Czechoslovakia."'

349
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:57,793
Let's go.

350
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,833
I thought you'd be bigger.

351
00:35:15,834 --> 00:35:18,239
<i>But I guess that's
the way it is with legends.</i>

352
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,243
Reality's always less.

353
00:35:20,244 --> 00:35:22,245
Who did it?

354
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:24,758
What difference does it make?

355
00:35:25,086 --> 00:35:26,912
Who did it?

356
00:35:26,913 --> 00:35:29,429
The United States
government owes me that much.

357
00:35:29,757 --> 00:35:32,425
We're soldiers.
We follow orders.

358
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:04,648
Hey.

359
00:36:04,649 --> 00:36:07,149
Stay.

360
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,970
What are you doing?

361
00:36:09,971 --> 00:36:12,298
Stay!!

362
00:36:12,299 --> 00:36:14,261
What do you think I'm doing?

363
00:36:14,262 --> 00:36:17,463
Trying to find a short-term
answer to a long-term problem.

364
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,632
You make that call, you're dead.

365
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:24,184
<i>Everybody you've ever
known, loved or talked to is dead.</i>

366
00:36:24,512 --> 00:36:26,676
I just saved your life!

367
00:36:26,677 --> 00:36:29,177
Yes, but you just ended yours.

368
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:34,656
Those two men
you just shot are Feds.

369
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:44,764
I need bolt cutters.
Do you have bolt cutters?

370
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:49,671
And something flammable.

371
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:06,254
I need your help.

372
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,100
Alright, douse them.

373
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:24,341
Hey, these guys,
they shoot first and ask questions later.

374
00:37:24,669 --> 00:37:27,477
<i>In 10 minutes, we're
gonna look just like that.</i>

375
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:38,453
Give it here.

376
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,902
Okay.
Okay.

377
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,644
C-

378
00:40:15,669 --> 00:40:17,639
Z-

379
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,906
<i>E-</i>

380
00:40:19,907 --> 00:40:22,407
<i>C-</i>

381
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:26,554
H-

382
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,588
<i>O-</i>

383
00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:39,702
S-L-O-

384
00:40:40,029 --> 00:40:44,603
V-A-K-I-A.

385
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,718
Bodies?

386
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:43,219
Burning.

387
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:47,202
Well, I guess that ends that.

388
00:41:47,295 --> 00:41:50,906
For your sake,
I hope that's true.

389
00:41:51,233 --> 00:41:53,064
I'm going to make a call now.

390
00:41:53,065 --> 00:41:55,469
Make him wait.

391
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:58,148
It's not my life
we're playing with.

392
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,183
He's asleep.

393
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:04,930
You wanna be
the one that wakes him up?

394
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:10,593
And by the
way-Johnny!-

395
00:42:10,921 --> 00:42:13,318
you still answer to me as well.

396
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:15,819
<i>Taking in a fight this evening, sir?</i>

397
00:42:15,904 --> 00:42:17,621
Why not?

398
00:42:17,622 --> 00:42:20,122
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

399
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,710
I need to get out up there.

400
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,947
<i>It's New Year's Eve.</i>

401
00:42:33,074 --> 00:42:35,574
Some of us have people
we wanted to see at midnight.

402
00:42:35,726 --> 00:42:39,283
We could, uh,
we could give you a lift.

403
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,421
Maybe in another life. Sir.

404
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:10,552
Let's go, Johnny.

405
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:46,547
It's not too deep.

406
00:43:46,548 --> 00:43:52,485
I'm gonna need you
to take this thing out.

407
00:43:53,793 --> 00:43:55,457
If I do this-

408
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:57,958
I'll do everything in
my power to wash your hands.

409
00:43:58,197 --> 00:44:01,306
<i>Okay now, clear that table.</i>

410
00:44:01,634 --> 00:44:04,134
Clear that table!

411
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:14,015
Oh!

412
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,487
Lay down.

413
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,832
Hey, hey wait, wait, wait.

414
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,660
Once you
get it out, it's easy,

415
00:44:30,826 --> 00:44:33,326
it's just like
sewing a patch on a pair of pants.

416
00:44:33,478 --> 00:44:35,192
Yeah, right.

417
00:44:35,193 --> 00:44:38,397
<i>Hey! Hey! Hey.</i>

418
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:43,778
Hey, oh, hey!
Whoa, what is that?

419
00:44:43,974 --> 00:44:47,487
What is this?
Barrington's.

420
00:44:47,814 --> 00:44:49,444
How old is this?

421
00:44:49,445 --> 00:44:52,087
I think 15 years.

422
00:44:52,415 --> 00:44:55,224
<i>Yeah, 15 years.</i>

423
00:44:55,551 --> 00:44:58,953
January 15, 1991.

424
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,994
Last time the Skins
won the Superbowl.

425
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:11,807
Hey, you better take
a swig to ease your nerves.

426
00:45:12,135 --> 00:45:17,148
I haven't steadied
my nerves since 1991.

427
00:45:17,475 --> 00:45:19,975
What color?

428
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:24,419
Gold.

429
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:32,198
I just realized,
I never got your name.

430
00:45:32,526 --> 00:45:36,924
Sometimes they
call me Mac. What's yours?

431
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,608
Nice to meet you.

432
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:28,383
There.

433
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:31,719
Yeah.

434
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:35,556
Happy New Year.

435
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,143
I love you.

436
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:59,406
I love you.

437
00:46:59,407 --> 00:47:01,907
Keep me close in your heart.

438
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:15,119
You are leaving.

439
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,620
Listen to me.

440
00:47:17,931 --> 00:47:21,371
The worst part
of my day is right now.

441
00:47:21,699 --> 00:47:24,199
When I have to leave you.

442
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:27,277
Then don't!

443
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:43,785
When will you come back?

444
00:47:43,786 --> 00:47:46,286
After the holidays.

445
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:58,808
<i>Me vas a dejar
por las navidades, hijo de puta!</i>

446
00:47:59,136 --> 00:48:01,373
Excuse me.

447
00:48:01,374 --> 00:48:02,801
<i>Vete.</i>

448
00:48:02,802 --> 00:48:05,514
<i>Vete! Dejame!
Leave me!</i>

449
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:08,342
Whoa, whoa!

450
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,350
I will.

451
00:48:17,351 --> 00:48:19,851
I didn't ask you anything.

452
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,090
I haven't asked
you anything yet.

453
00:48:27,091 --> 00:48:29,591
Sorry.

454
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:35,209
Can I be your husband?

455
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:40,071
Huh?

456
00:48:40,072 --> 00:48:42,572
And I'll be your wife.

457
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:49,223
That's good.

458
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,454
"Don't you want to know,

459
00:49:30,455 --> 00:49:33,500
who was on the other
end of the phone?"

460
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:49,717
"Carpe diem. "

461
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:54,151
"Carpe diem. "

462
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:50,946
<i>Who is the greatest quarterback of all time?</i>

463
00:50:51,274 --> 00:50:53,571
<i>Sonny Jurgensen.</i>

464
00:50:53,572 --> 00:50:57,855
<i>And why was he the
greatest quarterback of all time?</i>

465
00:50:58,182 --> 00:51:01,192
<i>Because he could
make something out of nothing.</i>

466
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:05,861
<i>And who was the moron coach
who didn't want him to play?</i>

467
00:51:06,189 --> 00:51:08,689
<i>George Allen.</i>

468
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:17,472
<i>And who was the coach
that saved the Redskins?</i>

469
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,630
<i>Joe Gibbs.</i>

470
00:51:19,631 --> 00:51:22,710
<i>And when you grow
up, what are you gonna do?</i>

471
00:51:23,037 --> 00:51:27,118
<i>Announce the games with
Sonny, Sam and Frank on the radio.</i>

472
00:51:27,446 --> 00:51:29,953
<i>And why do we know all of this?</i>

473
00:51:30,281 --> 00:51:32,781
<i>Because we love each other.</i>

474
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:39,565
<i># Hail to the Redskins
Hail Vic-tor-y #</i>

475
00:51:39,893 --> 00:51:43,927
<i># Braves on the Warpath
Fight for old D.C. ##</i>

476
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:41,022
That's for both of us.

477
00:52:41,333 --> 00:52:43,833
<i>Happy New Year.</i>

478
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,938
Let me guess.

479
00:53:07,939 --> 00:53:11,153
You're about
to tell me that my-problem-

480
00:53:11,481 --> 00:53:13,981
has taken a
turn for the worse.

481
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:19,816
You found this,

482
00:53:19,817 --> 00:53:22,317
in a wall at the Mayflower.

483
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,256
They think he's still alive.

484
00:53:26,257 --> 00:53:29,140
How about you?

485
00:53:29,467 --> 00:53:32,307
I'm not paid to think, sir.

486
00:53:32,635 --> 00:53:35,145
<i>Why would they think that?</i>

487
00:53:35,473 --> 00:53:39,050
He's an extraordinarily dangerous,

488
00:53:39,378 --> 00:53:41,739
and confused man
with an ax to grind.

489
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:44,511
You said it yourself,
those are the hardest to put down.

490
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,947
Carpe diem.

491
00:53:48,948 --> 00:53:50,316
Excuse me?

492
00:53:50,317 --> 00:53:51,819
Seize the day.

493
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:54,861
I know what it
means, sir, I just-

494
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:04,772
After Vietnam, the City
developed this program for lost veterans.

495
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:08,680
Putting them to work, rebuilding
the rail yards around Union station.

496
00:54:09,007 --> 00:54:15,107
And on every rail spike,
they inscribed the words "Carpe diem. "

497
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:21,522
Seize the day.

498
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:29,034
Honor is just-gone.

499
00:54:29,362 --> 00:54:33,736
I can't remember anything
anymore, anyway, someone once said,

500
00:54:34,063 --> 00:54:39,442
"He who has 100 victories
in 100 battles, is not the most skillful,

501
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:42,270
<i>"but rather he
who subdues the other's military</i>

502
00:54:42,535 --> 00:54:45,212
<i>without battle is
the most skillful. "</i>

503
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:48,040
Sun Tzu.

504
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:54,392
People look at
these men or soldiers,

505
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:57,219
and they think to themselves,

506
00:54:57,534 --> 00:55:00,019
<i>They must love to fight.</i>

507
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,534
But they've got it, they've got it
slightly twisted.

508
00:55:02,862 --> 00:55:06,100
You see, the good ones love to win.

509
00:55:06,427 --> 00:55:09,507
But they respect
the dangers of the fight.

510
00:55:09,835 --> 00:55:13,878
But nine times out
of ten, a fight, a war, a battle,

511
00:55:14,205 --> 00:55:17,079
is won without
the first punch being thrown,

512
00:55:17,406 --> 00:55:20,018
<i>the first shot
being fired, the palace captured,</i>

513
00:55:20,345 --> 00:55:23,218
<i>and that,
that is when you have honor!</i>

514
00:55:23,546 --> 00:55:26,889
When you
can capture a man's mind!

515
00:55:27,216 --> 00:55:32,426
Then his heart,
his fists, they're sure to follow.

516
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:42,405
Didn't you have
another life to be lived this evening?

517
00:55:42,733 --> 00:55:45,233
How did you do it, sir?

518
00:55:45,299 --> 00:55:47,799
Balance the two, live both lives?

519
00:55:47,819 --> 00:55:51,514
What's the question?
What is the same question,

520
00:55:51,841 --> 00:55:55,021
that you ask
yourself every day?

521
00:55:55,348 --> 00:56:00,189
What price do I pay
to make America a safer place today?

522
00:56:00,516 --> 00:56:04,061
A "safer place?"

523
00:56:04,389 --> 00:56:06,284
See, I think it's more like,

524
00:56:06,285 --> 00:56:11,702
"What price did I pay
today to defend the tenets of democracy?"

525
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:17,430
You, of all people, should
know the difference.

526
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:35,926
Is his-

527
00:56:36,253 --> 00:56:38,753
cash missing?

528
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,502
I know I shouldn't
ask this, but, um,

529
00:56:46,829 --> 00:56:49,329
where did you hide it?

530
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:59,883
Well, did he pick it
up before or after we got the tag?

531
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:02,710
Not sure.

532
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:20,836
Do you know why we
started using those cash boxes?

533
00:57:21,164 --> 00:57:22,864
Leverage.

534
00:57:22,865 --> 00:57:25,473
No, no. Balance.

535
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:31,714
So you wouldn't
forget who you were.

536
00:57:32,041 --> 00:57:36,181
And for the lucky ones,
so you could forget what you've become.

537
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,415
You do whatever
you need to do there, sport.

538
00:57:44,416 --> 00:57:46,916
It's not up to me anymore.

539
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:01,672
Looks like he came
back from the dead.

540
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:06,549
I would say you've
got 24 hours, sir.

541
00:58:06,876 --> 00:58:11,049
But I guess that's irrelevant now.

542
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:24,856
How long have I been out?

543
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:28,495
How long have I been out!

544
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:34,629
It's 11 o'clock.
About 23 hours.

545
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:44,945
You did a good job.

546
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:51,978
How do you take your coffee?

547
00:59:51,979 --> 00:59:55,681
Not at all,
thank you very much.

548
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,362
What'd I miss?

549
01:00:08,363 --> 01:00:13,041
Nothing, really.
They caught the Ace of Spades.

550
01:00:13,369 --> 01:00:15,869
What?

551
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,639
They caught the Ace of Spades.

552
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:20,872
When?

553
01:00:20,873 --> 01:00:23,373
About a week ago.

554
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:28,388
It doesn't say who caught him.

555
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:34,933
I know you're not a criminal,

556
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:37,929
I don't know what's
going on, and I don't wanna know.

557
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,636
I just wanna
know how I get out.

558
01:00:42,947 --> 01:00:45,397
I want this over.

559
01:00:45,398 --> 01:00:49,772
You don't want to
know how these guys are, Mac.

560
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:56,083
I don't know your name,
and I'm not gonna ask.

561
01:00:56,410 --> 01:00:59,152
But please, tell me.

562
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:03,655
Workin' on it, Mac.

563
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,840
Do you know where he is?

564
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:24,235
You can handle yourself, right?

565
01:01:24,236 --> 01:01:26,302
I do okay.

566
01:01:26,303 --> 01:01:28,803
But can you fight with that wound?

567
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,946
How much time do we have?

568
01:01:31,947 --> 01:01:34,178
About a day
before they find us.

569
01:01:34,179 --> 01:01:36,679
Follow me.

570
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:41,255
Where you goin', Mac?

571
01:01:41,256 --> 01:01:44,364
This is the smallest
big city in the world.

572
01:01:50,173 --> 01:01:52,673
Kill the lights.

573
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,723
You drive a hearse?

574
01:02:15,724 --> 01:02:18,224
Get in!

575
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:22,169
He drives a hearse.

576
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:39,655
Where we goin'?

577
01:02:39,982 --> 01:02:41,548
Where we going?

578
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:45,159
Have you ever
been to the Underground before?

579
01:02:45,486 --> 01:02:49,432
Yeah, once or twice.

580
01:02:49,759 --> 01:02:52,259
After my acc-

581
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,480
I am Sophia.

582
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,532
<i>My doctor used to talk to me</i>

583
01:04:06,533 --> 01:04:09,033
a lot about vision.

584
01:04:09,067 --> 01:04:13,383
He said some people
think that vision is that which is there.

585
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:18,953
But to him, vision
is seeing that which could be.

586
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:42,642
When we get inside,
you stay close to me.

587
01:04:42,970 --> 01:04:46,882
Don't speak. When
the bluesman comes to the table,

588
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:51,816
I'll set you up.
After that, it's up to you.

589
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:56,748
I don't need a weapon.

590
01:04:56,749 --> 01:05:00,395
That's good.
'Cause it's not for you.

591
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:06,792
When the bluesman is done,

592
01:05:06,793 --> 01:05:09,293
I need to talk to him.

593
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:20,914
When the old man finishes his set,

594
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:24,686
he's gonna
come over and sit down.

595
01:05:25,013 --> 01:05:27,513
Now you follow my lead.

596
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:41,568
In the car you
said you were in an accident,

597
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:44,396
what happened?

598
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:52,337
'91.

599
01:05:52,338 --> 01:05:55,176
The Skins had beat
the Bulls in the Superbowl.

600
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:02,157
I was going to a friend's
house to pick up my daughter.

601
01:06:04,026 --> 01:06:06,893
I'd had too much to drink.

602
01:06:07,221 --> 01:06:11,903
But in my mind, it wasn't enough.

603
01:06:12,231 --> 01:06:14,731
So I stopped,

604
01:06:14,896 --> 01:06:18,409
picked up a couple of bottles
of Barrington's vodka.

605
01:06:18,737 --> 01:06:21,474
At that store where we met.

606
01:06:21,802 --> 01:06:27,514
I had finished
about a half of one,

607
01:06:27,841 --> 01:06:31,720
on the way to Katie's.

608
01:06:32,048 --> 01:06:37,018
I was so drunk
I didn't even go to the door.

609
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:45,537
For some reason,
I made her sit in the back.

610
01:06:45,865 --> 01:06:50,874
Only the devil can
answer that for me now.

611
01:06:51,201 --> 01:06:54,109
The last thing I remember,

612
01:06:54,437 --> 01:06:56,935
is waking up
two days later in the hospital,

613
01:06:56,936 --> 01:07:00,046
handcuffed to a bed with
a ruptured spleen and a dead daughter.

614
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:08,085
Yeah. I've been in an accident.

615
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:18,231
Not yet.

616
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:24,604
Tell me about the police.

617
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:18,191
Long time. Mac.

618
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:20,250
Too long.

619
01:08:20,251 --> 01:08:22,053
Meat Truck come to the stage,

620
01:08:22,054 --> 01:08:24,554
telling me you in
here claiming you got a fighter.

621
01:08:24,863 --> 01:08:27,572
Something like that.

622
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,400
This him?

623
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,441
Let me get a look at you.

624
01:08:36,378 --> 01:08:42,374
I never forget
a face. I know you, yes?

625
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:46,586
I want for you
to get him in the cellar.

626
01:08:46,864 --> 01:08:48,415
See if he really wants it.

627
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:52,459
What are you saying?

628
01:08:52,786 --> 01:08:55,084
You want him to watch?

629
01:08:55,085 --> 01:08:57,585
Something like that.

630
01:08:57,794 --> 01:09:01,737
There's only
one way into that room.

631
01:09:02,064 --> 01:09:05,473
Give me a fight.
I'll do it for free.

632
01:09:05,801 --> 01:09:09,312
It doesn't really
matter who, just give me one tonight.

633
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:14,117
How much you
weigh... cowboy?

634
01:09:14,444 --> 01:09:16,944
A buck 85, give or take.

635
01:09:17,158 --> 01:09:21,288
Sorry, champ,
no middleweights are fightin' tonight.

636
01:09:21,615 --> 01:09:24,329
Only the big boys
are gonna bang.

637
01:09:24,657 --> 01:09:26,950
The bigger, the better.

638
01:09:26,951 --> 01:09:29,722
We got a deal?

639
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:40,410
<i>See that guy
over there? That's Meat Truck.</i>

640
01:09:40,737 --> 01:09:45,546
<i>He's new. But he'll come get you
in about an hour or so for your fight.</i>

641
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:55,257
One last thing.

642
01:09:55,585 --> 01:09:58,085
How shall I introduce you?

643
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:13,740
Go into that cellar
and tell the children to close their eyes.

644
01:10:14,067 --> 01:10:16,613
Tell the
women to shut their legs,

645
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:18,836
and the
men to put up their fists

646
01:10:18,837 --> 01:10:21,337
'cause there's a
war machine comin'.

647
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:41,301
Bet it's alright, man.

648
01:10:41,497 --> 01:10:43,429
Maybe not.

649
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:45,977
But the three wise
men don't like to be made wrong.

650
01:10:46,305 --> 01:10:49,144
Ready? One, two, three!

651
01:10:58,654 --> 01:11:00,543
What the hell is this?

652
01:11:00,544 --> 01:11:03,054
I don't know.
Nor do I want to.

653
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:13,427
Hey, what is that?

654
01:11:13,428 --> 01:11:16,901
You don't wanna
know, kid. Let's go.

655
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:26,885
Capturing the Ace
isn't our objective, is it?

656
01:11:27,212 --> 01:11:32,519
Hey!! Capturing the Ace
isn't our primary objective, is it?

657
01:11:32,847 --> 01:11:35,347
<i>Is it!!?</i>

658
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:44,197
No.

659
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:48,234
What the fuck is going on?

660
01:12:07,623 --> 01:12:10,123
Told you I didn't like this mission.

661
01:12:10,283 --> 01:12:14,793
You were always right.

662
01:12:18,967 --> 01:12:24,098
When I'm gone, finish it.

663
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:46,759
They're ready for yah.

664
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:55,764
This is anything goes.
You know that, dontcha?

665
01:12:59,308 --> 01:13:01,808
I bet that hurt.

666
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,840
<i>And in this corner,</i>

667
01:13:33,899 --> 01:13:38,180
<i>weighing in at 185 pounds,</i>

668
01:13:38,508 --> 01:13:41,213
the War Machine!
Yeah, you're right.

669
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:13,306
It was you, wasn't it?

670
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:17,343
The voice on the
other end of the phone.

671
01:15:17,671 --> 01:15:21,209
I have no idea
what you're talkin' about.

672
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:33,526
It's not my blood
you want on your hands.

673
01:15:33,853 --> 01:15:36,353
But you had to be
sure, didn't you?

674
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,900
Loyal to the end, that's my David.

675
01:15:41,130 --> 01:15:44,675
I'm not him anymore.

676
01:15:45,003 --> 01:15:47,099
You took that away from me.

677
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:49,600
Nothing you
weren't willing to give.

678
01:15:56,685 --> 01:15:59,175
I wasn't willing
to give up Sophia.

679
01:15:59,176 --> 01:16:03,560
Look, you should
know, David, that tonight,

680
01:16:03,887 --> 01:16:06,387
I traded-

681
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,055
<i>my life for yours.</i>

682
01:16:08,056 --> 01:16:11,434
<i>So that you
could continue to live,</i>

683
01:16:11,762 --> 01:16:13,488
<i>and do
what needs to be done.</i>

684
01:16:13,489 --> 01:16:17,036
Right the wrong.

685
01:16:17,363 --> 01:16:21,938
Maybe in another life.

686
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:27,246
Oh, God!

687
01:16:30,185 --> 01:16:33,322
I could be bound in a nutshell,

688
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:38,925
and count myself a king of infinite
space, if it had not bad dreams.

689
01:16:39,253 --> 01:16:45,353
But you, you never struck
me as the nutshell type, David.

690
01:16:47,029 --> 01:16:50,929
In a few moments,
I'm gonna walk out that door,

691
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:55,464
A gray Sedan,

692
01:16:55,465 --> 01:16:59,984
that's been circling
the block for the last four hours

693
01:17:00,312 --> 01:17:03,353
will just happen to
be passing by the club.

694
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:07,825
<i>And as luck would
have it, a young Hispanic male,</i>

695
01:17:08,153 --> 01:17:13,859
will fire two shots,
both in my direction.

696
01:17:14,187 --> 01:17:18,133
And I will die
a coward's death.

697
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:21,504
Alone, on a cold
and empty street,

698
01:17:21,831 --> 01:17:26,072
so that you can
become what you were born to be.

699
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:28,899
And already are.

700
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:38,985
A hero, David!

701
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:44,323
<i>A hero.</i>

702
01:19:51,019 --> 01:19:55,191
<i>When you saved
my life, you asked for no explanation.</i>

703
01:19:55,518 --> 01:19:58,628
<i>Given what you will soon
or already have read,</i>

704
01:19:58,956 --> 01:20:01,565
<i>I feel I owe
you that much.</i>

705
01:20:01,892 --> 01:20:04,392
<i>Ten days ago,</i>

706
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:38,791
Who is this?

707
01:21:51,606 --> 01:21:55,098
Why were we asked
to bring this to you?

708
01:21:56,678 --> 01:21:59,178
I assume you're not Mitchell.

709
01:21:59,439 --> 01:22:01,541
He's dead.

710
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:04,616
So many people think this war

711
01:22:04,944 --> 01:22:08,118
is about countries, about land.

712
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:14,561
Your friends probably
believe they died for liberty,

713
01:22:14,888 --> 01:22:18,834
for truth, for justice.

714
01:22:19,161 --> 01:22:23,733
And in a way, they
would be right, wouldn't they?

715
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:31,566
By the look on your face,

716
01:22:31,567 --> 01:22:34,484
and what you just heard,

717
01:22:34,811 --> 01:22:40,891
<i>you might be thinking
they died for money, for greed.</i>

718
01:22:41,218 --> 01:22:45,423
And in away,
you may be correct.

719
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:56,698
Why is it we become
those we fight so hard to exterminate?

720
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:04,579
My advice?
Keep running.

721
01:23:04,907 --> 01:23:09,316
<i>And pray the sins
of these old men</i>

722
01:23:09,644 --> 01:23:12,144
never catch up with you.

723
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:21,494
When I was a boy,

724
01:23:21,673 --> 01:23:24,600
a very powerful
American and his son

725
01:23:24,928 --> 01:23:27,734
came to visit my country.

726
01:23:28,061 --> 01:23:32,907
<i>When I was running
into the house,</i>

727
01:23:33,234 --> 01:23:38,883
<i>I heard the American
ask my father a strange question,</i>

728
01:23:39,210 --> 01:23:42,482
that I now ask of you.

729
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:48,623
Without villains, can there be heroes?

730
01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:54,365
<i>You must ask yourself,</i>

731
01:23:54,692 --> 01:23:57,733
why your country birthed a villain,

732
01:23:58,060 --> 01:24:02,368
in a land of sand and stone.

733
01:24:02,696 --> 01:24:06,005
Why they wouldn't
need so badly to have the power

734
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:10,779
<i>that only
a hero can possess.</i>

735
01:24:11,106 --> 01:24:17,206
And you'll, you'll
understand the Tao,

736
01:24:18,049 --> 01:24:23,790
the truth, or as
you people in the West call it,

737
01:24:24,117 --> 01:24:26,984
the Way of War.

738
01:24:55,957 --> 01:25:00,326
<i>That is my truth. That is my way.</i>

739
01:25:00,653 --> 01:25:04,430
<i>Ten days ago my name
was David Wolfe.</i>

740
01:25:04,757 --> 01:25:08,967
<i>I was a son to father,
a soldier to country,</i>

741
01:25:09,295 --> 01:25:11,840
<i>a lover to woman.</i>

742
01:25:12,168 --> 01:25:15,711
<i>I lived two lives,
I carried two names.</i>

743
01:25:16,039 --> 01:25:18,715
<i>Ten days later, I
have a single mission,</i>

744
01:25:19,043 --> 01:25:24,317
<i>a single hunt,
a single life, a single name.</i>

745
01:25:24,644 --> 01:25:27,144
<i>I am the Wolf.</i>

746
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:37,963
What have I done?

747
01:25:41,102 --> 01:25:43,602
<i>Were you able
to see the paper this morning, sir?</i>

748
01:25:43,913 --> 01:25:47,043
<i>It's horrible. It's tragic.</i>

749
01:25:47,371 --> 01:25:50,278
We will honor
him with a moment of silence,

750
01:25:50,605 --> 01:25:55,347
<i>before I address
the nation on that other matter.</i>

751
01:25:55,675 --> 01:25:58,952
<i>By the way,
how do we stand on that?</i>

752
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:01,577
I have it contained.

753
01:26:01,578 --> 01:26:03,616
Good.

754
01:26:03,617 --> 01:26:05,781
Oh, I want to thank
you for the present

755
01:26:05,782 --> 01:26:08,282
you left on my desk
this morning with the paper.

756
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:11,665
<i>You should know I plan
on incorporating its message into my address.</i>

757
01:26:11,992 --> 01:26:13,693
But l-

758
01:26:13,694 --> 01:26:16,268
<i>Ah, don't be silly.
It's an important concept,</i>

759
01:26:16,596 --> 01:26:20,778
in the wake of a grave tragedy.

760
01:26:21,105 --> 01:26:26,514
Carpe diem.
Seize the day.

761
01:26:26,841 --> 01:26:29,341
Must always look forward
in times like these.

762
01:26:29,589 --> 01:26:33,989
<i>Never backwards.</i>

763
01:26:34,317 --> 01:26:36,817
I didn't put that
on your desk, sir.

764
01:26:40,094 --> 01:26:42,756
Then who did?
