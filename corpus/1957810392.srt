[♪]

3
00:01:00,562 --> 00:01:02,730
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you for selecting me.

4
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,534
I know it must have been
a difficult decision.

5
00:01:06,568 --> 00:01:07,802
It was.

6
00:01:08,937 --> 00:01:11,204
This is the girl.
Her name is Amber.

7
00:01:12,941 --> 00:01:15,043
Address on the back.

8
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,611
I think your mission is clear.

9
00:01:17,779 --> 00:01:19,279
Not a problem, Mr. Fanst.

10
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:23,651
Consider it done.

11
00:01:23,685 --> 00:01:25,019
Before you take her out,

12
00:01:25,053 --> 00:01:26,921
you must ensure that
she successfully completes

13
00:01:26,955 --> 00:01:28,923
this series of tasks
laid out before her.

14
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,026
It is only after these tasks
are completed

15
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,062
that you can move forward
with taking her out.

16
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:37,665
- Is that clear?
- Absolutely.

17
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,502
Yes, sir.

18
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:43,738
As always,
secrecy is imperative.

19
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:47,107
It must be done quietly
by you by 8:00.

20
00:01:48,977 --> 00:01:51,946
If you haven't taken her out
by then, the deal is off.

21
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,749
Remember, this is your final job
before full induction.

22
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,784
Succeed,
and you will be accepted.

23
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,589
Failure, as you know,

24
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:03,791
leads to termination.

25
00:02:03,825 --> 00:02:05,325
Understood.

26
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,262
Not a problem.

27
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,666
I like you.
You know that, right?

28
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,368
Yes.

29
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:18,539
Yes.

30
00:02:19,574 --> 00:02:20,875
I want you to know

31
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:23,611
you are the only person
I selected for this job.

32
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:27,548
I trust you will be
able to do it...

33
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:29,617
alone.

34
00:02:30,785 --> 00:02:31,986
Of course.

35
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,223
Of course.

36
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,994
Good.

[♪]

40
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:55,295
[Amber] Yeah. I don't know,
he's just lying on the couch.

41
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:58,166
Because he's unconscious.

42
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:02,103
What was I supposed to do,
call an ambulance

43
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:04,572
and wait around
and answer questions all day?

44
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:06,040
Yeah, exactly.

45
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:10,377
It's not my fault
this keeps happening to me.

46
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,312
That time was
completely different.

47
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:17,952
I don't know,
shaggy hair, scruffy face.

48
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,521
He's not completely hideous
if that's what you're asking.

49
00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:24,892
I don't know.
Why would I peek at his dick?

50
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:29,496
Yeah, well, clearly you don't know
me as well as you think you do.

51
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:33,167
Okay, fine,
I looked at his dick.

52
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:36,037
Meh!

53
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:39,974
Yeah. Okay.

54
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,943
Look, I got to go.

55
00:05:41,976 --> 00:05:43,611
Lots to do today.

56
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:45,980
All right.
See you soon.

57
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,181
Bye.

58
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,951
Hi.

59
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:26,354
Hey.

60
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,757
Can you hear me?

61
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:38,566
Wow! What the fuck?
What the fuck?

62
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,269
Hey! Are you okay?

63
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,704
I don't know.

64
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:46,807
Where am I?

65
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:48,643
You're in my living room.

66
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:51,646
What happened?

67
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,547
- A door hit you.
- What?

68
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:54,916
- In the face.
- What?

69
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:57,518
I hit you with a door
in the face.

70
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,520
Look, the details
really aren't important.

71
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:00,922
How are you feeling?

72
00:07:03,024 --> 00:07:05,927
Like a truck just ran me over.

73
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,562
Oh, you poor thing.

74
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:10,497
If you follow me
into the kitchen,

75
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:13,167
I can get some ice
for your vagina.

76
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,670
What? You hit me in the face.

77
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:18,406
- Barely.
- You knocked me unconscious.

78
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,107
- With a door.
- Wh...

79
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:24,412
Well, I guess that
makes me "a-door-able."

80
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:29,317
Oh, or maybe that makes you
a total pussy.

81
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:32,820
Come on.

82
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:44,365
- This is a nice place.
- Oh, thanks.

83
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:48,202
I just rent out the guest room, but the
owners of the place are always traveling,

84
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:50,470
so I kind of have
the full run of the place.

85
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:51,872
Right now, they're in Belize.

86
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:55,109
Really? For how long?

87
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,445
About a month.
It's cool, right?

88
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,879
That's super cool.

89
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:02,383
- I'm Whalen, by the way.
- Amber.

90
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,651
Nice to meet you.

91
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,619
Except for the whole
door-to-the-face thing.

92
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:09,557
Right!
An ice pack for your vag.

93
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,958
I almost forgot.

94
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:24,538
Your vagina is down there.

95
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:27,008
- Thanks, but...
- Ice your vagina.

96
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:31,879
- But I don't...
- Ice your vagina.

97
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,852
There. Is that better?

98
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,154
My dick is cold.

99
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,989
But how's your vagina?

100
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,026
It's cool too.

102
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,999
- Is that cake?
- Yeah, I made it.

103
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,834
- Do you want a piece?
- Sure.

104
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:55,102
It's red velvet.

105
00:08:55,136 --> 00:08:57,638
Oh. Then never mind.

106
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,340
You don't like red velvet cake?

107
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,376
Don't even get me started
on red velvet cake.

108
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,445
What's wrong
with red velvet cake?

109
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:08,315
Red velvet cake is just a bland,
semi-chocolate-adjacent confection

110
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:10,785
that people have only convinced
themselves they like

111
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:12,521
simply because
it's a pretty color.

112
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,221
Red velvet cake is awesome!

113
00:09:14,255 --> 00:09:17,458
Really? Because if it wasn't
red, nobody would eat it.

114
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:19,393
If it was brown,
it would just be

115
00:09:19,427 --> 00:09:22,696
pretty shitty chocolate cake,
and nobody would care.

116
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:27,568
Great. Now you've ruined
my favorite dessert.

117
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,070
Thank you for that.

118
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:30,505
You are welcome.

119
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:32,239
Can I take this ice
off my dick now?

[sighs]

121
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:36,644
[Amber] In all seriousness,

122
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:39,046
I do feel bad about hitting you
with that door.

123
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,348
- In the face.
- In the face.

124
00:09:41,382 --> 00:09:44,018
Listen, I'm gearing up
for a pretty big day,

125
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:47,154
but feel free to stay and rest
as long as you need.

126
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:49,524
I'm not going anywhere
anytime soon.

127
00:09:49,558 --> 00:09:51,692
Thanks, I will.

00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,127
Come on.

I should probably get that.

00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,321
Probably.

135
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,242
- Hi!
- Hi!

136
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:43,477
- Melissa?
- No.

137
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:44,712
Is Melissa here?

138
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:46,981
No, no Melissas here.

Nobody named Melissa lives here?

Really?

141
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:53,821
I see.

142
00:10:54,623 --> 00:10:57,758
I knew it! I knew
this would happen again!

143
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,761
This always happens!
I shouldn't even be surprised.

144
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:02,930
- What?
- Nothing.

145
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,599
[Amber] What happened?

146
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:06,000
Nothing!

147
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:08,135
I shouldn't have even
expected her to show up.

148
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:11,972
They never show up.
I hate blind dates.

149
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:13,974
Someone told you
Melissa lived here?

150

00:11:16,611 --> 00:11:18,812
- And you brought flowers.

No!

Oh, can I ask you a question and
you promise me you'll be honest?

155
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:31,992
Of course.

156
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,029
Is that red velvet cake?

157
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:38,098
- Yes.
- I love red velvet cake.

158
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:41,168
I know! So good, right?

159
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:42,836
So good.

160

wouldn't like red velvet cake.

Amen, brother!
Would you like a piece?

162

I don't know if I should.

A lifetime on the hips,
you know what I mean?

164
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:56,817
I do.
But you know what?

165
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,787
Sometimes you just have
to say "fuck it."

166
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,856
- Fuck it!
- Exactly!

167
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,693
Because you deserve cake.

168
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,293
I do deserve cake, don't I?

169
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:08,162
You deserve red velvet cake!

170
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,496
The best cake.

171
00:12:09,531 --> 00:12:13,234
The best cake for the best boy!

172
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:16,170
- Thank you.
- [Amber] Of course.

173

This has been a crazy day...
for a lot of people.

174
00:12:20,675 --> 00:12:23,043
Why don't you sit down
and get a bit of rest first?

175
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:24,646
Okay.

176
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,746
Come on.

177
00:12:34,355 --> 00:12:35,889
There we go.

178
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,926
Do you want to talk about it?

179
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,629
What's wrong with me?

180
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:45,332
- Whalen?
- Davis.

Do you two know each other?

182
00:12:47,736 --> 00:12:49,270
How do you two know each other?

183
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,707
We share common interests.

184
00:12:52,741 --> 00:12:55,543
Really? That's nice!

185
00:12:55,577 --> 00:12:58,245
Yes, it's very nice.

186
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:00,848
- It's the best thing ever.
- [phone buzzing]

187
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:03,518
Oh, will you guys excuse me
for just a minute?

188
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:05,386
Of course.

189
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:07,288
- Not a problem.
- [door closes]

190
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:09,232
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing. What are you doing here?

191
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:11,058
- Nothing.
- Yeah, me too.

192
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:13,561
Mr. Fanst didn't by chance call
you in for a meeting recently?

193
00:13:13,595 --> 00:13:15,296
- Maybe. You?
- Maybe.

194
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:20,401
- So we're here for the same thing, aren't we?
- Certainly, seems that way.

195
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:22,412
- Any chance we can both do this?
- I don't think so.

196
00:13:22,436 --> 00:13:24,572
Evidently, one of us
is supposed to fail.

197
00:13:24,606 --> 00:13:27,241
- I'm afraid I can't afford to do that.
- Well, neither can I.

198
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:30,044
Well, then, I'd say we have
a problem on our hands.

199
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:31,780
I'd say you do.

200

[footsteps]

201
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:35,983
Sorry about that.
What were we talking about?

202
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:39,486
Davis was just explaining
how he got rid of his latest...

203
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:41,355
rash.

204
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:44,058
What was the name
of that ointment again?

205
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:45,459
I'll be sure to write it down

206
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,662
so the pharmacist gets it
just right for you.

207
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:49,564
[whispers]
His is a scorcher.

208
00:13:49,597 --> 00:13:51,465
That's what we were
talking about?

209
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,100
Yeah.
You don't remember?

210
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:55,469
That's all this guy ever
talks about it, his "region."

211
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:58,138
- I don't talk about my region that much.
- It's pretty constant.

212
00:13:58,172 --> 00:13:59,849
I don't talk about my region
in great frequency.

213
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:02,076
I actually don't even
refer to it as my "region."

214
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:04,854
- He calls it his region all the time.
- I don't talk about my region!

215
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:06,447
See? He's still doing it.

216
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,149
I'm pretty sure that's not
what we were talking about.

217
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:12,920
Are you okay?

218
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:14,756
Yeah. What's wrong with you?

219
00:14:14,789 --> 00:14:16,299
There's something
really wrong with him.

220
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:18,292
I"m glad you noticed too.
What's wrong with you?

221
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:20,127
All this region talk.
Honestly!

222
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,863
I'd say it's beneath you, but
now I'm not so certain that it is.

223
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:25,800
Why don't you go peddle your
pornography elsewhere, you smutmonger.

224
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:29,370
It's disgusting, and I will not
allow it underneath my roof.

225
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:32,106
Why don't you just show us on
the doll where he touched you?

226
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:35,309
You've offended our host
and the damage is beyond repair.

227
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:38,580
I suggest you leave immediately.
Good day, sir!

228
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,249
Well, that's not exactly
what I meant.

229
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,885
Yeah, Whalen,
don't be so judgmental.

230
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:47,555
He's so judgmental.
Intolerant, really.

231
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:49,500
That's probably a better word
for it, intolerant.

232
00:14:49,524 --> 00:14:52,059
It's sad.
Disgusting, even.

233
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:55,062
"Disgusting" might be
how most people describe it.

234
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:58,499
[gasps] Is this because
I'm 1/64 Cherokee?

235
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:03,538
So racist, Whalen, so racist!
You should leave.

236
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:07,509
Go until you can get some proper
counseling and some real perspective.

237
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:11,646
Go. Heal your mind,
heal your heart, heal your soul.

238
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:14,181
Take some much needed
Whalen time.

239
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:17,151
It's okay. Nobody here
is going to judge you.

240
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,589
Anyway, so sorry
you have to leave so soon.

241
00:15:21,623 --> 00:15:23,223
We're really going
to miss you, pal.

242
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:25,392
Oh, such a bummer
you have to be leaving.

243
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:28,530
Hey, write, keep in touch.
And, hey, don't be a stranger.

244
00:15:28,563 --> 00:15:29,597
Are you both leaving?

245
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:30,598
- No.
- No.

246
00:15:30,632 --> 00:15:31,733
So, you're both staying.

247
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:32,901
- No.
- No.

248
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,903

what's going on here.

You do?

250
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:38,071
It's pretty obvious.

251
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:39,674
It is?

252
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:43,545
You both have had
a really rough day,

253
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:46,113
and you both need some rest.

254
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:49,584
Nobody's going anywhere
until I'm good and ready.

255
00:15:49,617 --> 00:15:52,419
And I won't take no
for an answer.

256
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:54,455
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

257
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:56,758
Good. Follow me.

258
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,201
Relax and make yourselves
right at home.

259
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:09,369
I'll be back to check
on you boys in a bit.

260
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,476
- [door closes]
- What is your problem?

261
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,712
How dare you imply
that I'm 1/64 racist?

262
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:20,214
You know I'm sensitive to
the plight of the Native peoples.

263
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:23,217
- What are you talking about?
- Why do you always have to cause problems?

264
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,385
Me?
What are you talking about?

265
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:26,955
A rash on my region!

266
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:28,989
Where the hell
did that come from?

267
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:32,392
- That was funny.
- Yeah, funny like a fox.

268
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:33,460
Mm...

269
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:37,632
Just don't let the door hit you
in the ass on the way out.

270
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:39,399
Oh, okay.
I'm a little confused.

271
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:42,102
- Are you walking or should I call you a cab?
- [sighs]

272
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:45,239
Look, she's gonna come out of
that room in less than one minute.

273
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:48,442
And when she does, one
of us had better not be here.

274
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,578
Like, I don't know,
you, for example.

275
00:16:50,612 --> 00:16:53,480
I'll tell you what.
Why don't we put it to a vote?

Whalen should stay?

Wow! No one.

279
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:03,725
Nobody likes you.
It's unanimous. Leave.

280
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:07,595
- Don't touch me.
- I'm sorry.

281
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:10,297
Why don't you leave
and we'll call it even?

Okay, that sounds fair.

353
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,562
You're so dead...

354
00:21:34,595 --> 00:21:36,531
as soon as I find
an oxygen tank.

355
00:21:36,564 --> 00:21:39,634
Just... just another minute.

356
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:41,702
Just a little more.

357
00:21:41,736 --> 00:21:44,105
- Rest is good.
- [exhales]

358
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,741
[blows nose]

359
00:21:46,774 --> 00:21:48,676
[♪]

360
00:21:49,644 --> 00:21:51,478
- [yawns] Okay.
- I'm ready...

361
00:21:51,512 --> 00:21:53,047
whenever you are.

362
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,481
I'm ready.

363
00:21:54,515 --> 00:21:56,217
Okay, I'm ready.

364
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,554
No. No.
Not yet, not yet.

365
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:03,624
- Oh, I think I'm dying.
- Oh, thank God.

366
00:22:04,292 --> 00:22:06,326
[♪]

367
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:16,671
[♪]

368
00:22:16,704 --> 00:22:18,840
[both choking]

369
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,676
[♪]

370
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,378
[choking continues]

371
00:22:26,514 --> 00:22:28,850
[♪]

372
00:22:28,883 --> 00:22:31,018
[growling]

373
00:22:31,052 --> 00:22:33,087
[♪]

374
00:22:34,622 --> 00:22:37,390
[both growling]

375
00:22:39,694 --> 00:22:43,064
[sniffing]

376
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:47,001
[both growling]

377
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:50,238
[phone buzzing]

378
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:54,942
Hi.

379
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,711
[growling continues]

380
00:22:58,145 --> 00:22:59,547
- [both whimper]
- [door closes]

381
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:02,984
- You okay?
- What's wrong?

382
00:23:03,017 --> 00:23:06,120
[sighs] My help for today
just totally bailed on me.

383
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:09,557
I'm so screwed.
I have so much to do today.

384
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,993
Now I'm never
gonna get it all done.

385
00:23:12,026 --> 00:23:14,729
- I'll help you.
- I will too.

386
00:23:14,762 --> 00:23:17,164
Really?
You guys would do that?

387
00:23:17,198 --> 00:23:19,499
I won't leave until everything
on your list is done.

388
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:20,968
Me either.

389
00:23:21,002 --> 00:23:23,905
Oh, my God!
You guys are lifesavers.

390
00:23:23,938 --> 00:23:26,374
I can't believe you guys
would do this for me.

391
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,242
Well, I'm full of surprises.

392
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:30,311
You're full of something.

393
00:23:47,695 --> 00:23:50,998
- [Davis] Holy shit!
- I know, right?

394
00:23:51,032 --> 00:23:54,735
The owners of this house asked me to
help them clean out some of this stuff.

395
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:57,238
I could really use your help
with a bit of the lifting.

396
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:03,077
- Of course.
- That's what we're here for.

397
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:07,214
So, which of the stuff
do you need help moving?

398
00:24:07,248 --> 00:24:09,016
- All of it.
- All of it?

399
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,852
W-Where are we supposed
to put it all?

400
00:24:11,886 --> 00:24:12,920
In there.

401
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,725
But all this stuff
won't fit in there.

402
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:20,027
Thank you.
Let me know when you're done.

403
00:24:24,932 --> 00:24:27,068
What the fuck?

404
00:24:27,101 --> 00:24:29,370
Whatever, wussy.
Start lifting.

405
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,587
[Davis] I'm not a wuss.
You're a wuss.

406
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:39,411
[Whalen] You are a wuss,
that's why I said it.

407
00:24:40,781 --> 00:24:43,117
So, the recipe
I developed for my class

408
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,586
is an original
organic vegan spin

409
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:48,055
on classic Scandinavian
comfort food.

410
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,459
Look, we don't have
that much time.

411
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,094
I don't care
what it tastes like,

412
00:24:53,127 --> 00:24:54,905
we tell her it's fantastic
and move on, got it?

413
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:56,197
Got it.

414
00:24:57,832 --> 00:24:59,200
Here it is.

415
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:04,739
That looks amazing.

416
00:25:04,772 --> 00:25:08,509
Yes, very... inventive.

417
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:10,077
Wait till you taste it.

418
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,982
- What is it?
- It's chicken.

419
00:25:15,016 --> 00:25:16,117
Chicken?

420
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,618
I thought you said it was vegan.

421
00:25:17,651 --> 00:25:18,686
It is.

422
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:22,123
It's "chicken" with a "K."

423
00:25:22,156 --> 00:25:23,624
Chicken's always spelled
with a "K."

424
00:25:23,657 --> 00:25:24,992
What the fuck is going on?

425
00:25:25,026 --> 00:25:26,761
You guys wanna know
what's really weird?

426
00:25:26,794 --> 00:25:29,163
We call cows beef, pig pork,

427
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:32,033
sheep mutton, and deer venison,

428
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:33,501
but chicken...

429
00:25:34,468 --> 00:25:36,103
We just call it chicken.

430
00:25:37,872 --> 00:25:39,106
Isn't that weird?

431
00:25:42,043 --> 00:25:44,011
What the fuck
are you talking about?

432
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:46,180
[Amber] Try it!

433
00:25:51,185 --> 00:25:54,021
[birds chirping]

434
00:25:54,055 --> 00:25:56,791
[♪]

435
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:01,838
[whispering]
You seem really uncomfortable.

436
00:26:01,862 --> 00:26:04,231
Dude, just, honestly,
don't get so close.

437
00:26:04,265 --> 00:26:05,900
Why are you so uncomfortable
with this?

438
00:26:05,933 --> 00:26:07,802
Why are you not
uncomfortable with this?

439
00:26:07,835 --> 00:26:09,737
- Stop moving, please.
- [both] Sorry.

440
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,082
[whispering] I'm just really
comfortable with my masculinity.

441
00:26:12,106 --> 00:26:14,308
This kind of stuff
doesn't really bother me.

442
00:26:14,341 --> 00:26:17,812
- My inner thigh is touching your dick.
- Is it?

443
00:26:17,845 --> 00:26:20,381
I hadn't really noticed Little G
sort of has a mind of his own.

444
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:22,683
Little G?
Your dick's a rapper now?

445
00:26:22,716 --> 00:26:24,985
My dick's musical stylings
are not confined to one genre

446
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:26,921
and defy labeling,
thank you very much.

447
00:26:26,954 --> 00:26:29,090
And I'm pretty sure my dick
is touching your thigh.

448
00:26:29,123 --> 00:26:31,258
- That's what I just said.
- No.

449
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:33,870
You said that your thigh was touching my
dick, but my dick is touching your thigh.

450
00:26:33,894 --> 00:26:35,496
Little G is the aggressor.

451
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,407
- I just wanted to make sure you knew that.
- [grimaces]

452
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,667
- Stop moving.
- [both] Sorry.

453
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,936
She's right, though, you
probably should stop moving.

454
00:26:41,969 --> 00:26:44,171
- Especially your inner thigh.
- Oh, my God!

455
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:47,174
On second thought,
keep doing it.

456
00:26:48,042 --> 00:26:49,578
Stop it.

457
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,278
[Davis]
Okay, jiggle, do it.

458
00:26:51,312 --> 00:26:53,414
- Oh, yeah.
- Stop it.

459
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:56,417
Oh, jiggle for me.
Jiggle.

460
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,686
Yeah.

461
00:26:58,719 --> 00:27:00,754
Don't move!

462
00:27:00,788 --> 00:27:03,491
- Don't move.
- Stop it.

463
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:06,727
Oh!

464
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,130
- Please tell me you're faking.
- Stop climaxing.

465
00:27:09,163 --> 00:27:10,631
[both]
Sorry.

466
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:17,606
I'm telling you, this one
girl's room smelled like shit.

467
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:20,040
I know that we say that
spoiled milk and dirty sneakers

468
00:27:20,074 --> 00:27:22,109
smell like shit, but they don't.

469
00:27:22,143 --> 00:27:26,780
They smell bad;
her room smelled like shit.

470
00:27:26,814 --> 00:27:28,983
Like a pile of shit.

471
00:27:29,016 --> 00:27:31,719
Like somebody just went
in there, took a dump,

472
00:27:31,752 --> 00:27:35,122
and then left it there
for like a very long time.

473
00:27:35,156 --> 00:27:37,124
And then she just went on
living her life

474
00:27:37,158 --> 00:27:41,395
as if the pile
and the stink weren't there.

475
00:27:43,964 --> 00:27:45,499
So, what did you do?

476
00:27:45,534 --> 00:27:47,301
She broke up with me.

477
00:27:53,707 --> 00:27:55,809
Can't you like
just try to sympathize?

478
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:57,044
[Whalen] Shut up.

479
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:11,725
Oh.

480
00:28:18,332 --> 00:28:19,568
What do you think?

481
00:28:21,902 --> 00:28:26,273
Davis, you have to try it too.

482
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:42,723
Mm!

483
00:28:42,756 --> 00:28:45,960
That's... something.

484
00:28:45,993 --> 00:28:48,162
- Right?
- [Davis] Mm-hmm.

485
00:28:48,195 --> 00:28:50,331
- Mm-hmm.
- Right.

486
00:28:50,364 --> 00:28:53,500
The secret ingredient is love.

487
00:28:53,535 --> 00:28:56,170
- Hmm.
- I'm just kidding.

488
00:28:56,203 --> 00:28:58,739
The secret ingredient
is Helsinki yak juice.

489
00:28:58,772 --> 00:29:00,642
- Ugh!
- [gags]

490
00:29:00,675 --> 00:29:02,009
[Whalen gags]

491
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:04,713
Yak... juice?

492
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:06,347
Yeah!

493
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,249
I don't even wanna ask
what that means.

494
00:29:08,282 --> 00:29:10,685
Not that it's super important
right now,

495
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:14,689
but anything coming
from a yak is not vegan.

496
00:29:14,723 --> 00:29:15,990
Sure, it is.

497
00:29:17,024 --> 00:29:18,492
This is from a yak.

498
00:29:20,394 --> 00:29:23,330
- With a "K."
- Yak was always spelled with a K.

499
00:29:23,364 --> 00:29:26,000
You know what?
Never mind.

500
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:27,134
Do you like it?

501
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:32,840
Yeah, it's...
Yeah, it's pretty good.

502
00:29:32,873 --> 00:29:34,676
- Yeah?
- [meekly] Mm-hmm.

503
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:36,277
Good!

504
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,746
Keep eating!

505
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:44,118
This is gonna go really bad
in like 20, 25 minutes.

506
00:29:44,151 --> 00:29:47,488
All right,
only two more courses to go.

507
00:29:51,992 --> 00:29:55,029
[both gagging]

508
00:29:58,932 --> 00:30:01,536
- Ow! Hurry up!
- I'm trying!

509
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:03,404
How many cats
could she possibly have?

510
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:06,473
[sputters] - This is clearly
the work of a mountain lion.

511
00:30:06,508 --> 00:30:08,777
Oh, God, I got it in my eye!

512
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:11,111
I'm blind!
Cat piss made me blind!

513
00:30:11,145 --> 00:30:12,946
- [grunts]
- [wailing]

514
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,783
Her cats need a healthier diet.

515
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:16,383
Get a dog, woman!

516
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:19,721
- Help me!
- I can't see!

517
00:30:19,754 --> 00:30:22,122
- Lift the bag!
- [crying] I can't!

518
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:23,824
I don't wanna do this anymore.

519
00:30:23,857 --> 00:30:25,826
- [sputtering]
- [whimpering]

520
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:28,730
So, what I'm saying is,
you know how some gay guys

521
00:30:28,763 --> 00:30:30,931
talk in stereotypical gay voice?

522
00:30:30,964 --> 00:30:32,933
I don't think we should
be talking about this.

523
00:30:32,966 --> 00:30:36,303
Well, what if everyone had
their own stereotypical voice?

524
00:30:36,337 --> 00:30:39,139
Like you go into a bar
and every woman you meet,

525
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:40,841
you know instantly
what she's into

526
00:30:40,874 --> 00:30:43,177
just by the sound of her voice,
right off the bat.

527
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,614
Just by her accent, you
know that this girl's into S&M,

528
00:30:46,648 --> 00:30:49,249
and then you don't have to find
out the hard way two hours later

529
00:30:49,283 --> 00:30:53,153
when she's melting cinnamon-scented
candle wax all over your junk.

530
00:30:53,187 --> 00:30:54,988
That's oddly specific.

531
00:30:55,824 --> 00:30:57,625
No, it isn't.

532
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:00,361
Instead, right away, you know
from the moment they say hello,

533
00:31:00,394 --> 00:31:02,930
you would know that this girl
does anal on the first date.

534
00:31:02,963 --> 00:31:04,498
And this guy,
he definitely goes down

535
00:31:04,532 --> 00:31:07,301
on his woman
for like a very long time.

536
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:10,170
It'd be a hell of a system and
it would really, really streamline

537
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:11,806
the whole dating process.

538
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,974
[exhales]
You're weird guy.

539
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:15,643
I know.

540
00:31:15,677 --> 00:31:17,344
Doesn't mean I'm wrong, though.

541
00:31:23,984 --> 00:31:26,286
So, the second course
is just pickles?

542
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:29,524
Don't even get me started
on pickles.

543
00:31:29,557 --> 00:31:30,725
What's wrong with pickles?

544
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:32,827
Why would anyone do that
to a cucumber?

545
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:34,928
I mean, brine? Really?

546
00:31:36,531 --> 00:31:38,700
You have really strong opinions
about food.

547
00:31:38,733 --> 00:31:41,368
Look, I get it if you're
sailing across the ocean

548
00:31:41,402 --> 00:31:43,137
and it's the only way
to preserve food

549
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,739
because it's the 1600s
or whatever,

550
00:31:44,773 --> 00:31:47,074
but nowadays,
people have refrigerators.

551
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:49,076
So we no longer need
to soak our food

552
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:51,513
in piss and vinegar
or whatever it is.

553
00:31:51,546 --> 00:31:55,315
I'm pretty sure the first
ingredient in brine is not piss.

554
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,385
Really?
And what is it, then?

555
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:00,287
What's in pickle juice?

556
00:32:01,288 --> 00:32:03,190
- I have no idea.
- So, it could be piss.

557
00:32:03,223 --> 00:32:05,092
- It's not piss.
- It's probably piss.

558
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:07,995
You guys basically
just confirmed that it's piss.

559
00:32:08,028 --> 00:32:09,631
Can't argue with science.

560
00:32:14,803 --> 00:32:17,572
- Excuse me, Amber.
- [Amber] Yes?

561
00:32:17,605 --> 00:32:19,874
- Why am I holding this grapefruit?
- Why do you care?

562
00:32:19,908 --> 00:32:22,176
Because I thought it would be
cool and fun to draw.

563
00:32:22,209 --> 00:32:23,912
I'm trying to understand
my motivation.

564
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:25,946
Your motivation
is to stand there and shut up

565
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:29,283
so she can draw us as quick as
possible before you try to get me pregnant.

566
00:32:29,316 --> 00:32:31,686
Oh, relax.
That would never happen.

567
00:32:31,719 --> 00:32:33,353
You're not my type.

568
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:36,957
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

569
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,425
- Huh?
- "You're not my type."

570
00:32:38,459 --> 00:32:40,127
I'm everyone's fucking type.

571
00:32:41,763 --> 00:32:43,397
Are you fucking kidding me
right now?

572
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,934
No. I'm manly
in a non-threatening way.

573
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:47,578
I'm charming
and I have rugged good looks.

574
00:32:47,602 --> 00:32:49,704
Any woman would be lucky
to have me.

575
00:32:49,737 --> 00:32:51,205
Okay.

576
00:32:51,238 --> 00:32:53,140
Admit it, if you were a man
and I was a woman,

577
00:32:53,173 --> 00:32:54,576
you'd totally wanna fuck me.

578
00:32:54,609 --> 00:32:57,044
- I am a man.
- Uh... see what I mean?

579
00:32:57,978 --> 00:32:59,446
You're a very strange dude.

580
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,114
It's not my fault
you're into me.

- Hold the fucking bag!
- Okay!

- Why does she hate us?
- Why do the cats hate us?

00:33:16,831 --> 00:33:18,499
They don't hate us,
they hate her!

587
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:21,435
- Your cats hate you!
- Just so you know.

588
00:33:21,468 --> 00:33:23,203
Did you two say something?

589
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:25,840
- Nope.
- So glad we can help.

Yay, cats!

Oh, good!

Ow! Ow! Stop!

00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:35,482
Ah!

[Whalen whimpers]

595
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,788
Okay, good.

596
00:33:40,822 --> 00:33:43,591
So now just go to your desktop.

00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:45,693
- My desktop?
- Yes.

598
00:33:45,727 --> 00:33:47,996
- Go to your desktop.
- Okay.

599
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:51,933
How do I do that?

600
00:33:51,966 --> 00:33:55,269
Okay, it's just like
I showed you before.

- No.

- This?
- No! Don't do that!

606
00:34:05,713 --> 00:34:07,549
- Sorry.
- No, it's fine.

607

When I was a kid, everyone declawed
their cats to preserve their furniture.

00:35:31,331 --> 00:35:33,701
You can't declaw cats.
It's cruel.

Cruel? We neuter them
all the time.

Bob Barker encouraged
that shit for years.

627
00:35:37,805 --> 00:35:39,707
But that's to control
the population.

628
00:35:39,741 --> 00:35:41,576
Oh, so it's inhumane
to trim a cat's claws,

629
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:43,443
but to chop their balls off
is totally cool?

Sometimes, there is no truth.

635
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:01,796
Let's say
you meet a girl at a bar.

636
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:03,330
Does she have a specific lisp?

637
00:36:03,363 --> 00:36:04,732
Shut up.

638
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:06,233
It's 2:00 a.m.
You're drunk.

639
00:36:06,266 --> 00:36:08,636
You go back to her place
for a little ground and pound,

640
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:11,939
and then you sneak out as you're
won't to do, and you find your way home.

641
00:36:11,973 --> 00:36:15,076
Now, was that girl looking hot
that night?

642
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:17,244
There's no way of knowing.

643
00:36:17,277 --> 00:36:20,090
You can't remember her name and you don't
remember how to get back to her house,

644
00:36:20,114 --> 00:36:23,651
so you can never go back there,
even if you wanted to, and you don't.

645
00:36:23,685 --> 00:36:25,787
And she can't contact you
because you were meticulous

646
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,723
about not leaving behind
any distinguishing information,

647
00:36:28,756 --> 00:36:30,925
which is part,
but not all, of the reason

648
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:32,894
why you gave her
the fake name Paco.

649
00:36:34,028 --> 00:36:37,497
And even if she could contact
you, what's she gonna say?

650
00:36:37,532 --> 00:36:40,168
Girls have no realistic sense
of what they look like anyway.

651
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,837
Skinny girls think they're fat,
fat girls think they're skinny,

652
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,982
and deep down even the most
attractive women in the world

653
00:36:45,006 --> 00:36:46,507
think they're disgusting.

654
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:48,275
Now, your friends
were also there.

No matter how hot she was,

they're just gonna
tell you she was ugly.

And no matter what kind of
sorry-ass, low-down, ragged bitch

658
00:36:54,649 --> 00:36:57,785

that she was
so motherfucking fine.

00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:02,590
So, what's the truth?

00:37:03,591 --> 00:37:06,060
There is no truth.
She's Schrodinger's biatch.

She's both hot and butt-ugly
at the same goddamn time.

00:37:11,165 --> 00:37:12,967
That's actually pretty deep.

Hey, if you bang an ugly chick
in the forest,

665
00:37:15,536 --> 00:37:18,139
and no one's around to see it,
did you actually bang her?

666
00:37:18,172 --> 00:37:19,741
Yes, Whalen, you did.

667
00:37:19,774 --> 00:37:22,009
The answer on that's
not gonna change.

668
00:37:22,043 --> 00:37:23,544
Stop asking.

669
00:37:28,783 --> 00:37:32,653
Okay, so I know grammar and
punctuation can be confusing,

670
00:37:32,687 --> 00:37:34,622
but you just need
to add a comma.

671
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,390
Here?

672
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:38,960
After the verb.

673
00:37:40,962 --> 00:37:42,429
After the verb.

674
00:37:43,798 --> 00:37:45,566
What part of speech is "angina"?

675
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:48,669
Is it a verb?

676
00:37:48,703 --> 00:37:52,405
And that's not
what "irrepressibly" means.

677
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:54,041
- Why not?
- Because it doesn't.

678
00:37:54,075 --> 00:37:57,712
And "conversate" is not a word,
I promise you.

679
00:37:57,745 --> 00:37:59,247
Oh, really?

680
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:01,414
Because I'm pretty sure
you and I

681
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:04,118
are "conversating" right now.

682
00:38:04,152 --> 00:38:07,255
Don't.
Just don't.

683
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:10,591
Fine. I guess I'll just
"conversate" by myself.

684
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:12,193
I hate our school system.

685
00:38:12,226 --> 00:38:15,029
- Are semicolons real?
- I hate it so much.

686
00:38:15,062 --> 00:38:16,998

687
00:38:24,939 --> 00:38:27,241
Fuck cats.
You got a dog?

688
00:38:27,275 --> 00:38:29,777
Yeah, I have a little pug
and chihuahua mix.

689
00:38:29,811 --> 00:38:32,046
- You'd love him.
- That's great, man.

- Holy shit.

00:38:34,582 --> 00:38:37,118
[Davis] Yeah.
You wanna see my big guy?

692
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:39,352

show you mine first.

it gets stuck in my pants.

00:38:49,197 --> 00:38:51,464
- [laughs] Thanks, man.
- That's a perfect size.

697
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:53,067
[Whalen]
Yeah, I'm really lucky.

698
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,501
Works great for me too.

699
00:38:54,535 --> 00:38:56,336
Makes the chicks go crazy.

700
00:38:56,369 --> 00:38:57,738
- Really?
- Hell, yeah!

701
00:38:57,772 --> 00:39:00,274
I mean, I take him out,
walk to the park,

702
00:39:00,308 --> 00:39:01,742
meet tons of women that way.

703
00:39:01,776 --> 00:39:03,644
Really? You just take him out
and show him off?

704
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:04,912
Hell, yeah.

705
00:39:04,946 --> 00:39:07,347
I mean, I show them
my best smile first,

706
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,517
but it's when they look down
and see him

707
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,852
that they just go crazy.

708
00:39:10,885 --> 00:39:12,596
They come running over
and they're so excited

709
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,965
to put their hands all over him
and give him tons of kisses.

710
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:17,424
Sometimes two or three girls
at a time.

711
00:39:17,457 --> 00:39:21,262
The amount of stroking from random
women at the park is unbelievable.

712
00:39:21,295 --> 00:39:27,367
All right, now, check out
the size of this fat hog.

713
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,770
Holy shit!
You weren't lying.

714
00:39:29,804 --> 00:39:31,606
- That sucker is huge.
- Yeah.

715
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:35,209
Sometimes I think this big
might actually be too big.

716
00:39:35,243 --> 00:39:37,645
Really? I didn't know
there was such a thing.

717
00:39:37,678 --> 00:39:39,379
Oh, there is.
Trust me.

718
00:39:39,412 --> 00:39:41,716
When you're toting around
one this big,

719
00:39:41,749 --> 00:39:44,619
- it actually makes it harder to meet women.
- Huh.

720
00:39:44,652 --> 00:39:48,823
Most girls see from a distance and
they just start backing away slowly.

721
00:39:48,856 --> 00:39:52,326
And if there's kids around,
pfft, forget about it.

722
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,863
Nobody's gonna let their kids
touch a monster this size.

723
00:39:55,897 --> 00:39:58,332
Not that I'd want them to,
but, I mean, if their moms

724
00:39:58,366 --> 00:40:00,735
are okay with it, I guess I
would be too, you know?

725
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,070
- Mm, yeah.
- [Davis] Don't get me wrong.

726
00:40:03,104 --> 00:40:05,840
There's some cool things about
having something this big.

727
00:40:05,873 --> 00:40:07,875
It keeps me from getting
bored when I'm lonely,

728
00:40:07,909 --> 00:40:11,379
especially when it's the middle
of the night and I can't sleep.

729
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:14,515
But cleaning up
after he's done his thing...

730
00:40:14,548 --> 00:40:16,550
Not cool, believe me.

731
00:40:16,584 --> 00:40:18,686
- You know what we should do?
- What?

732
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:21,856
- Put them together.
- [Whalen] I don't know.

733
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:24,491
I don't know if I'd be comfortable
around something that big.

734
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:26,861
Let alone
how my little guy would react.

735
00:40:26,894 --> 00:40:29,664
- Although, it could be kind of cool.
- Right?

736
00:40:29,697 --> 00:40:31,999
[Whalen] You've
convinced me. Let's do it.

737
00:40:32,033 --> 00:40:33,935
All right, that's enough,
you sickos!

738
00:40:33,968 --> 00:40:36,404
Keep your dicks
away from each other!

739
00:40:44,812 --> 00:40:46,414
That was good advice.

740
00:40:47,248 --> 00:40:48,448
You're welcome.

741
00:40:49,617 --> 00:40:50,818
Come on.

742
00:41:00,795 --> 00:41:03,297
All right, boys,
we're going for a ride.

743
00:41:03,331 --> 00:41:05,066
Great.
Where are we headed?

744
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:07,568
- It's a surprise.
- How fun.

745
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:10,237
It's gonna be super fun.

746
00:41:10,271 --> 00:41:15,209
Okay, but first, let me finish
my thought, please?

747
00:41:15,242 --> 00:41:20,614
- Fine.
- Okay, so as I was saying, my dick is not that dirty.

748
00:41:20,648 --> 00:41:22,883
I mean, I wash my hands
when I take a piss, sure,

749
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:24,885
I'm not an animal,
but this dude,

750
00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:28,089
he went and took a piss and
then proceeded to wash his hands

751
00:41:28,122 --> 00:41:29,924
in scalding hot water
and a pile of soap

752
00:41:29,957 --> 00:41:33,127
for like five minutes just
because he touched his own dick.

753
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,563
I mean, I don't know what
meth-head's dirty, dirty ass crack

754
00:41:35,596 --> 00:41:38,498
this dude was messing around in
ten minutes before that,

755
00:41:38,532 --> 00:41:40,835
but my dick's not that dirty.

756
00:41:40,868 --> 00:41:44,472
And if your dick is that dirty,
like so dirty that your hands

757
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:46,607
just touch it
and they instantly become

758
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,011
absolutely fucking filthy,

759
00:41:50,044 --> 00:41:51,912
then you're probably not
the kind of guy

760
00:41:51,946 --> 00:41:53,581
who's in the habit
of washing his hands

761
00:41:53,614 --> 00:41:55,683
when he takes a piss
in the first place.

762
00:41:57,351 --> 00:42:00,321
- Can we go now?
- If I'm being honest,

763
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:02,990
I should be washing my hands
before I touch my dick.

764
00:42:03,024 --> 00:42:04,492
My hands are disgusting.

765
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:06,627
They touch all sorts
of dirty shit every day,

766
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:10,364
like doorknobs, and money,
and shoelaces.

767
00:42:10,398 --> 00:42:13,267
I mean, my dick basically
wakes up in the morning,

768
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,437
it takes a shower, puts on
a clean pair of underwear,

769
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,539
and then just sits there
all goddamn day,

770
00:42:18,572 --> 00:42:20,074
minding its own business.

771
00:42:20,908 --> 00:42:23,744
My dick's probably
the cleanest part of my body.

772
00:42:25,346 --> 00:42:28,482
Except when it's touching
your inner thigh, Whelan.

773
00:42:28,517 --> 00:42:30,885
Then the whole thing is dirty.

774
00:42:30,918 --> 00:42:33,587
The whole thing.

775
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:38,159
- What is he talking about?
- His region.

776
00:42:38,192 --> 00:42:40,027
Of course.

777
00:42:40,061 --> 00:42:41,495
Thank you, guys.

778
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,697
I feel a lot better now.
We can go.

779
00:42:47,168 --> 00:42:49,136
[car engine starts]

780
00:42:53,707 --> 00:42:59,380
[indistinct chatter]

781
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:01,315
He sent me flowers every day.

782
00:43:01,348 --> 00:43:04,585
He asked me out every weekend,
even though I kept saying no.

783
00:43:04,618 --> 00:43:07,922
He stopped by my apartment just
to tell me he was thinking about me.

784
00:43:07,955 --> 00:43:09,924
It was so romantic.

785
00:43:09,957 --> 00:43:11,859
I miss him.

786
00:43:11,892 --> 00:43:13,894
That's fucking creepy.

787
00:43:13,928 --> 00:43:16,430
Persistence is romantic.

788
00:43:16,464 --> 00:43:18,533
It shows a woman
how much you love her.

789
00:43:18,567 --> 00:43:22,002
The persistent pursuit of a woman
is only called romantic in the movies.

790
00:43:22,036 --> 00:43:24,872
In real life,
it's called stalking.

791
00:43:24,905 --> 00:43:28,175
That shit is illegal, trust me.

792
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:31,445
[♪]

793
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,549
Well, think about it.

794
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:36,050
You buy a gallon of gas.

795
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:37,751
You buy a gallon of milk.

796
00:43:37,785 --> 00:43:39,920
Would you ever buy
a gallon of soda?

797
00:43:40,721 --> 00:43:43,757
No, you buy
two-liter bottles of soda.

798
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:46,427
Why? Nothing else
in this country is in liters.

799
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:50,197
If you tried to sell a liter of gas to an
American, they'd punch you in the dick.

800
00:43:50,231 --> 00:43:51,765
Cans are in ounces.

801
00:43:51,799 --> 00:43:53,968
Even the little bottles of soda
are on ounces.

802
00:43:54,001 --> 00:43:57,572
But if you want a big bottle,
suddenly you're in Europe buying liters.

803
00:43:57,606 --> 00:43:59,574
It makes no fucking sense.

804
00:43:59,608 --> 00:44:01,942
I have a major rant boner
right now.

805
00:44:01,976 --> 00:44:03,944
Can we please go?

806
00:44:07,148 --> 00:44:09,817
[car engine starts]

807
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:12,887
[♪]

808
00:44:22,663 --> 00:44:24,566
[birds chirping]

809
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:26,667
Okay, are we rolling?

810
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,269
Davis, these are my cameramen.

811
00:44:28,302 --> 00:44:30,738
This is Johnny, and that's
his brother Jimmy over there.

812
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:33,174
- Hello.
- We good?

813
00:44:33,207 --> 00:44:34,909
Okay.

814
00:44:34,942 --> 00:44:36,177
What's up, guys?

815
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:38,245
Thanks for tuning in
to this week's video.

816
00:44:38,279 --> 00:44:39,813
Don't forget to like
and subscribe

817
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:42,016
because we've got a great one
for you today.

818
00:44:42,049 --> 00:44:43,450
Are you a YouTuber?

819
00:44:43,484 --> 00:44:45,319
I'm an influencer.

820
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:47,254
It's prank week!

821
00:44:47,288 --> 00:44:50,057
Today's mark is waiting
in line at a coffee shop.

822
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,859
Well, you told him
to get you a latte.

823
00:44:51,892 --> 00:44:53,127
Shut up.

824
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,763
And he has no idea
what's about to happen.

825
00:44:55,796 --> 00:44:57,508
- [Davis] What is about to happen?
- Shut up.

826
00:44:57,532 --> 00:44:58,699
Come on.

827
00:45:03,037 --> 00:45:05,439
Okay, there he is.

828
00:45:05,472 --> 00:45:08,175
- [whispers] What are we doing?
- Just follow my lead.

829
00:45:11,245 --> 00:45:12,514
[Amber]
There he is!

830
00:45:12,547 --> 00:45:14,949
This is the asshole
I was telling you about.

831
00:45:17,084 --> 00:45:20,321
- What?
- And his new slut.

832
00:45:20,354 --> 00:45:23,457
- Oh...
- Oh, not so loyal that slut.

833
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:26,126
Hurts, doesn't it... Steven?

834
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,728
What's happening?

835
00:45:27,761 --> 00:45:30,030
[Amber] I bet you thought
you'd never see me again.

836
00:45:30,064 --> 00:45:31,999
Well, here I am.

837
00:45:32,032 --> 00:45:33,867
Kick his ass, Gary.

838
00:45:41,108 --> 00:45:44,078
- Me?
- Yes, Gary.

839
00:45:44,845 --> 00:45:46,080
Do your thing.

840
00:45:47,348 --> 00:45:49,483
[clears throat]
Okay.

841
00:45:50,552 --> 00:45:52,419
Hey, asshole!

842
00:45:52,453 --> 00:45:53,722
You better...

843
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:56,725
s-stay away from my sister!

844
00:45:56,757 --> 00:45:58,092
Yeah, tell him, Gary!

845
00:45:58,125 --> 00:46:02,029
Yeah, you better not
touch her ever again!

846
00:46:02,062 --> 00:46:03,897
- Guys, I'm a little confused.
- Yeah.

847
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:07,501
You're confused about what's
gonna happen if you don't...

848
00:46:08,202 --> 00:46:13,073
s-stop trying to force her to have
a back-alley abortion, you sicko!

849
00:46:13,107 --> 00:46:14,542
Oh, no. Nope, not me.

850
00:46:14,576 --> 00:46:15,943
No... no forced abortions here.

851
00:46:15,976 --> 00:46:19,246
- I... I don't even know them.
- Oh, really...

852
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,781
- Steven.
- ...Steven?

853
00:46:20,814 --> 00:46:23,017
After you've explored each other
from every angle

854
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:25,953
and ravaged each other
in every hole?

855
00:46:25,986 --> 00:46:31,191
- Well, maybe not every hole.
- In every... single... hole.

856
00:46:31,225 --> 00:46:34,729
How dare you deny
that you know her biblically,

857
00:46:34,763 --> 00:46:37,264
mythically, and exponentially?

858
00:46:37,298 --> 00:46:39,867
- Okay, maybe we should just...
- Shh, you stay out of this.

859
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:43,070
And you, you stay away
from her dog too.

860
00:46:43,103 --> 00:46:44,972
Cringle doesn't like
your kind of "petting."

861
00:46:45,005 --> 00:46:47,274
I don't care what you say.

862
00:46:47,308 --> 00:46:49,644
No more trying to hide
the panda in the grotto.

863
00:46:49,678 --> 00:46:51,579
No more donkey punching.

864
00:46:51,613 --> 00:46:53,981
No more trying to make
the bald man cry.

865
00:46:54,014 --> 00:46:57,451
You disgust me, sir.
<i>J'accuse!</i>

866
00:46:59,521 --> 00:47:02,423
Yeah, well...
you know what, Gary?

867
00:47:02,456 --> 00:47:03,490
Yeah...

868
00:47:03,525 --> 00:47:04,825
- Steven.
- ...Steven?

869
00:47:04,858 --> 00:47:07,261
Maybe you should stop
sending her dick pics.

870
00:47:07,294 --> 00:47:09,963
She doesn't want to see
your dingus, no one does.

871
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,802
- My dingus?
- Yeah.

872
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:16,504
Does anyone here
want to see Gary's dingus?

873
00:47:16,538 --> 00:47:18,272
No one? No one!

874
00:47:18,305 --> 00:47:19,907
No one wants to see your dingus.

875
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:22,309
Your dingus is unwanted.

876
00:47:22,343 --> 00:47:23,977
You send your sister dick pics?

877
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:26,815
No. No, I don't.

878
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:29,850
You look familiar.
Don't you live in my building?

879
00:47:29,883 --> 00:47:33,287
Me? No, I've never been
to apartment 3-C.

880
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,623
Stop telling people
I send my sister dick pics!

881
00:47:35,657 --> 00:47:38,959
- Stop telling people I wanna bang her dog!
- Stop calling me Gary!

882
00:47:38,992 --> 00:47:41,529
This is really confusing.

883
00:47:42,664 --> 00:47:46,534
And let that be a lesson to you.

884
00:47:46,568 --> 00:47:48,369
She's gonna keep this baby,

885
00:47:48,402 --> 00:47:50,672
and we're gonna raise it
as our own.

886
00:47:56,511 --> 00:47:58,780
And if I ever see you again,

887
00:47:58,813 --> 00:48:02,282
my sister's finger
won't be the only thing

888
00:48:02,316 --> 00:48:05,820
getting repeatedly shoved up
your ass.

889
00:48:05,854 --> 00:48:06,887

890
00:48:11,492 --> 00:48:13,127
Don't forget the almond milk.

891
00:48:14,228 --> 00:48:16,096
That was so good!

892
00:48:17,398 --> 00:48:19,577
What? Like you've never tried
to bang someone's dog before?

893
00:48:19,601 --> 00:48:21,201
No frontsies!

894
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:22,202

896
00:48:26,875 --> 00:48:29,476
Okay, that was fucking crazy,
and she's crazy,

897
00:48:29,511 --> 00:48:31,713
and we both need to get
the fuck out of here.

898
00:48:31,746 --> 00:48:33,347
You can go, I can't.

899
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,549
I can't afford to fail.

900
00:48:34,582 --> 00:48:36,216
Neither can I.
Fuck!

901
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,752
How did we even end up here?

902
00:48:37,786 --> 00:48:39,754
I don't know.
And I don't feel well.

903
00:48:39,788 --> 00:48:41,054
I think I have Ebola.

904
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:42,423
Ebola. Really?

905
00:48:43,157 --> 00:48:45,034
Are you bleeding out of
your ears, eyes, and anus?

906
00:48:45,058 --> 00:48:46,861
I'm not bleeding
out of my ears and eyes.

907
00:48:46,895 --> 00:48:49,329
I am bleeding out of my anus,
though, to be fair.

908
00:48:49,363 --> 00:48:51,932
I don't think that has
anything to do with Ebola.

909
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,935
What if we both just leave?

910
00:48:54,968 --> 00:48:58,338
- They'll have to grant one of us induction anyway, right?
- I don't know.

911
00:48:58,372 --> 00:49:02,209
But if this is what it takes, I'm not even
sure if I wanna be inducted in anymore.

912
00:49:02,242 --> 00:49:03,778

I can't handle
any more of these tasks.

915
00:49:08,616 --> 00:49:09,950
Me either.

916
00:49:14,923 --> 00:49:19,293
Okay, I'll admit that ended up
taking a few unexpected twists,

917
00:49:19,326 --> 00:49:22,062
but it turned out better
than I could have ever imagined.

918
00:49:22,095 --> 00:49:24,699
Your "dingus" line
is already trending.

919
00:49:24,732 --> 00:49:26,935
I consider that
a job well done, boys.

920
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:30,304
I'm all done with my list.
Thank you so much for your help.

921
00:49:30,337 --> 00:49:32,072
- So, all your tasks are done?
- Yeah.

922
00:49:32,105 --> 00:49:33,575
That means ours almost is too.

923
00:49:33,608 --> 00:49:35,142
- What?
- Nothing.

924
00:49:35,175 --> 00:49:37,978
Okay, I have to go finish
getting ready,

925
00:49:38,011 --> 00:49:40,748
but it's such a relief
to have everything else done.

926
00:49:40,782 --> 00:49:42,182
We should celebrate.

927
00:49:43,751 --> 00:49:44,853
[door closes]

928
00:49:46,521 --> 00:49:48,890
You heard the lady,
it's time to celebrate.

929
00:49:48,923 --> 00:49:50,157
For one of us.

930
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:52,493
And to think
you almost just quit, bitch!

931
00:49:52,527 --> 00:49:54,662
Me? You almost just quit.

932
00:49:54,696 --> 00:49:57,732
- That's not how I remember it.
- [mocking] "That's not how I remember it."

933
00:49:57,765 --> 00:49:59,734
Look, the tasks are done.

934
00:49:59,767 --> 00:50:02,169
- It's time for one of us to finish this.
- Fine!

935
00:50:02,202 --> 00:50:06,206
Then let's figure it out,
once and for all, like men.

Hey, so we're having
a bit of trouble

agreeing on a decision
and we need your help.

Got it. I'm thinking of a

- Go.
- Uh... 37?

- Why?
- What are we even doing?

and take out Amber myself?

is that tough, okay?

Of course you had fun; you
got to hang out with me all day.

we're gonna do.

me five minutes to get it done.

Right, I did.
