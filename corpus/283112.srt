1
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:35,758
My son, our family owes
a lot to the cyclo taxi.

2
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,532
We work hard, day and night.

3
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:43,265
Eating and sleeping in the street.
Pedaling all the time.

4
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:48,173
Some mornings, the backaches

5
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:51,315
nail you to the bed.

6
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,748
I don't know where it all leads.

7
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,420
This has been my life.

8
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,093
When I die,
I'll have nothing to leave you.

9
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:05,129
If you can, see if you can find

10
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,200
something more worthy.

11
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,544
You're late!

12
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,356
Look again and see if I'm right.

13
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:22,606
"The People's committee makes loans"

14
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,470
"in line with the policy."

15
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:28,638
"of fighting poverty."

16
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:29,646
Where is it? Show me.

17
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:15,222
CYCLO

18
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:25,336
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

19
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,834
Parents’ occupation?

20
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,674
We're very poor.

21
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,475
Answer me, your parents?

22
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,283
My mother died in childbirth.

23
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,280
My father too, an accident...

24
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,218
How did he die?

25
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,783
A truck...he died instantly,
with two passengers.

26
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,991
At Hang Xanh intersection, right?

27
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,088
Yes.

28
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,737
Who's left?

29
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:05,369
My grandfather, my sisters.

30
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:08,379
They study in the morning
and work in the afternoon.

31
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,415
What do they do?

32
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,214
The eldest delivers water to the market,

33
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:16,811
the little one shines shoes.

34
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,058
And your grandfather?

35
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,194
He repairs tires.

36
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,523
Who rents you the cyclo taxi?

37
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,330
The boss lady, in Cholon.

38
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,294
- Her name?
- I don't know.

39
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,500
- How much per day?
- 5,000 dongs.

40
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,035
And the deposit?

41
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,610
200,000 dongs.

42
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:49,282
Okay, we'll consider your file.

43
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,648
- We'll let you know.
- Yes.

44
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,076
These days it hurts.

45
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,709
When I piss. What about you?

46
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,477
Me too. It burns.

47
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,411
You've got to drink, it helps.

48
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,420
It makes you sweat, wears you out.

49
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,425
A doctor warned me,

50
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,063
take anything to build muscles.
You end up impotent.

51
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,022
Nonsense.

52
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,465
Yeah, right! Who can afford a doctor?

53
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,536
Better to see a butcher.

54
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:50,374
Shoe shine, sir, shoe shine?

55
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,197
- You free, kid?
- Yes.

56
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,925
Number 8, Le Loi Street.

57
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,438
How dare you steal our clients?

58
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:31,741
It's her...

59
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,209
This is our turf.
If you want to live, get lost!

60
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,837
- Beat it, you're on our turf!
- Go away.

61
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,617
Yes, you're my little fish.

62
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,101
So, how much?

63
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:00,400
It's a good day, 26,000.

64
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:03,407
5,000 for you, 21,000 for me.

65
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,903
No problem?

66
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,479
The thugs took a passenger from me.

67
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:12,883
Careful, each turf has its gang.

68
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:19,515
You hungry? Want to eat?

69
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,588
Wai!

70
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,966
Wash him, give him something to eat.

71
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,494
Go with him.

72
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:57,626
He was born that way,
He must be your age.

73
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,856
Take care of your tooth.

74
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,889
You see, I told you.

75
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,526
Okay, that's enough, get out.

76
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,705
Come on Grandpa, it's late.

77
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,209
Yes, let's go home.

78
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,736
- Bring tobacco for grandfather.
- Yes.

79
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,035
Is your shoulder better?

80
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,108
It gets worse everyday.

81
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,209
Do you have any balm left?

82
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:30,515
Hardly any.

83
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,275
I'll bring some back for you.

84
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,291
Grandfather, take the scale,

85
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,293
they send us by mistake

86
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,490
and change jobs, it'll be easier.

87
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,201
See how it's done.

88
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,562
Someone comes, you wipe.

89
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:28,299
You invite him, 1,000 dongs per person.

90
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,767
We shouldn't. The scale isn't ours.

91
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,479
Yes, we can, we've waited long enough.

92
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,908
No one has claimed it.

93
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,742
Your shoulder's hurting.

94
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,849
You can't keep pumping tires.

95
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,856
Let's wait awhile.

96
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:57,354
"On the old riverbanks.
Leaves and flowers fade"

97
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:06,923
"The sun dies, icy, shuddering"

98
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:15,596
"Hesitant, I cross the hamlet"

99
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:23,474
"My childhood, I remember you"

100
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:32,084
"l remember your graceful silhouette"

101
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:40,890
"You gazed at me, radiant, tender"

102
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:49,469
"l remember the sun was setting"

103
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:57,072
"on your ivory cheeks
your rippling hair"

104
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,137
Put him to bed.

105
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,911
Tomorrow. I'll come see
if you're dead or not.

106
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,129
Get up, little brother.

107
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,235
Go wash up.

108
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:39,755
"lf l, the Heron, die by boiling"

109
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:48,591
"May it be in clear water"

110
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:57,039
"To ease my children's suffering"

111
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,137
Follow them.

112
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,478
And not a word, to anyone.

113
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:15,849
"Bom has a fan made of palm leaves"

114
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:24,802
"The rich man says, I'll trade you"

115
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:30,572
"Three cows and nine buffalo"

116
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:34,778
"l don't want your buffalo"

117
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:42,580
"I'll give you a pond full of fish"

118
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:47,416
"l don't want your fish"

119
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:54,927
"I'll give you a raft of precious wood"

120
00:23:55,434 --> 00:24:03,773
"l don't want your wood"

121
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:12,973
"I'll give you a bird..."

122
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,785
Tomorrow, come to the icehouse.

123
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:19,584
I'll tell you what to do.

124
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,507
Go now, and be discreet.

125
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:07,894
What's the matter?

126
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,365
- Who is it?
- Why?

127
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,771
He stole my cyclo.

128
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,912
Don't be stupid,
he works for the boss lady.

129
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,443
Let's go!

130
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:55,671
Wait here.

131
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,514
Don't go out.

132
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:04,079
Except to eat.

133
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,760
And don't lock the door.

134
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,411
Close your mouth, it stinks.

135
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:40,157
- Do you have any money?
- No.

136
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:57,857
We stayed up all night again.

137
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:28,652
Let's go to sleep.

138
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:35,020
- Can I sleep here?
- Another time.

139
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,300
I don't want to do it.

140
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,821
I came, because you wanted me to.

141
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:34,403
I called, no one answered.

142
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:35,801
Can I come in?

143
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:37,832
Don't touch her.

144
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,170
It's her first time.

145
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:55,049
Would you like to pee?

146
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,457
You want to piss?

147
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,401
Peepee, you get it?

148
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,765
Understand?

149
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,001
Go on, pee!

150
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,084
Drink...go on, drink!

151
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,619
Drink and pee.

152
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:40,625
Pee, please! Drink again!

153
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,808
Again, drink up!

154
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:07,084
That's enough! Piss!

155
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:50,232
And do it standing up!

156
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:40,867
I brought you two friends.

157
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:43,910
People are singing your praises.

158
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,373
You're a Samaritan.

159
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:52,388
You tried to save a drowning man?

160
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:58,061
The boss is happy.
She sent you this reward.

161
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,132
Damn, you're disgusting.

162
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,570
She wants to see you, for another job.

163
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:20,316
What? What did you say?

164
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,442
I don't dare.

165
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,646
I didn't ask your opinion!

166
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:25,351
You dare refuse?

167
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:28,890
What does he want? Say it again!

168
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,278
Open your mouth!

169
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:22,537
This is a taste.

170
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:27,339
Next time, it'll be straight. Sabotage!

171
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:29,378
250 tons of moldy rice.

172
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,340
Do you know who did it?

173
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:33,779
Imagine yourself in the headlines?

174
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,743
That's a life sentence!

175
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:02,141
Nameless river.

176
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:10,209
I was born sobbing

177
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,216
blue sky, vast earth.

178
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:17,084
Black stream water.

179
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:26,500
I grow with the months, the years,

180
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:31,303
with no one to watch over me.

181
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:33,469
Nameless man.

182
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,445
Nameless is the river.

183
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,909
Colorless the flower.

184
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:48,023
Perfume. Without a voice.

185
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:52,759
O river! O passerby!

186
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,864
In the closed cycle

187
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,164
of the months, the years.

188
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:04,203
I can't forget my debt to my roots.

189
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:11,043
And I wander through worlds

190
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:13,444
towards my land...

191
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:17,951
His father won't let me work.

192
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:21,315
I'm bored.

193
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:24,121
I'm going in circles.

194
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:27,286
So I busy myself with small tasks.

195
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:28,860
Is Papa well?

196
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:30,898
He just came home.

197
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:34,726
When he leaves, I feel so alone.

198
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:37,430
You're thin.

199
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:42,436
When he was little, his nose bled.

200
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:45,110
Does it still happen?

201
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:49,508
Yes. Sometimes.

202
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:52,555
I'll show you a photo.

203
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,630
He's still here?

204
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:07,464
What are you looking for?

205
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:12,331
He's our son. Please, speak to him.

206
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:16,244
He came with his whore?

207
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:17,113
Please.

208
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:20,377
I don't want to see him.

209
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:32,059
He was five years old.

210
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:42,670
- Stay and eat with us.
- Mama...

211
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:45,901
No, no, he won't let me.

212
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:43,090
We were starving...

213
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:47,496
No rice...

214
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:49,965
People dying everywhere.

215
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:59,748
We loved each other deeply. At 16, or 17.

216
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:09,323
We drank alcohol. To forget our hunger.

217
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:14,929
A bit of shrimp paste.

218
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:22,198
On the end of the nail. And we drank...

219
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:54,099
It lasted a year...
then the child was born.

220
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:00,739
He came out backwards.

221
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:05,579
Too late...almost dead.

222
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:10,848
The doctor said "Abnormal".

223
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:26,295
The father left us.

224
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:30,067
Coward. He was a coward.

225
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,401
Why coward...

226
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:40,006
He was only 17.

227
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,952
Younger than his son is now.

228
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:49,252
And then...

229
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:03,699
How much for a bottle of gasoline?

230
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:04,899
5,000

231
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:12,875
And this?

232
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:15,846
10,000.

233
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:20,875
Not bad! And all alone!
You're a real pro!

234
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,714
No cop can catch me.

235
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:26,181
I know all the shortcuts.

236
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:29,390
Sure, you're a cyclo driver.

237
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,485
You like skirts?

238
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:01,447
Women's underwear?

239
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:02,616
That's all there was.

240
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:04,023
You sure you're a guy?

241
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,453
Show me.

242
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:49,505
That's my gift. Take it. For real.

243
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:53,465
I want to join the gang.

244
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:06,053
- What did he say?
- What did you just say?

245
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:07,654
I got a shock too.

246
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:09,686
Which gang were you talking about?

247
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,390
I want to be like you.

248
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:57,335
Take him to Mr.Lullaby!

249
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:42,952
Look at my hands? See?

250
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:45,921
In 1956.

251
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:51,316
I was 17, a bullet cut the nerve

252
00:58:51,427 --> 00:58:53,554
my hand stiffened up.

253
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:58,727
And look at this...

254
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:04,637
A bullet, through the neck.

255
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:08,842
It came out the back.

256
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:10,270
How it is?

257
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:22,286
And then this, here.

258
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:26,693
Guess which hole is bigger?

259
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:28,425
in '57,

260
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:35,766
a bullet shattered my shin.

261
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:37,301
You know why I'm telling you all this?

262
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:39,941
I know what you're
thinking faced with death.

263
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:43,871
I understand you so well.

264
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:53,620
"Autumn wind blows.
Sleep my child, sleep"

265
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:58,184
"The night is long"

266
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:01,497
"I'll watch over you"

267
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:07,302
"Until the end of the night.
I'll watch over you."

268
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:09,170
Listen carefully to

269
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:12,065
the art of syncopation.

270
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:20,514
"Sleep, my child, my beloved"

271
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:29,990
"my little one"

272
01:00:58,021 --> 01:00:59,386
Keep it as a souvenir.

273
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:02,516
Take it!

274
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:10,757
Ah, for an iced tea!

275
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:15,003
- Waiter! An iced tea!
- Yes.

276
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:54,145
Why don't you love me as much as them?
