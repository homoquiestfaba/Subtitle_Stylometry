1
00:03:11,826 --> 00:03:13,795
Did you get everything you need?

2
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:16,931
I saw you shooting me,

3
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:22,804
Stalker.

4
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,807
OK. OK, yeah you caught me.

5
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:28,810
So I'm...

6
00:03:28,843 --> 00:03:29,944
Tessa. From Echo Park.

7
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:33,313
Look, I assumed shooting
you was OK since you were late

8
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,650
and I, I was just bored.

9
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:47,461
Aren't you supposed to offer me
a drink or something?

10
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:50,497
Right. Hey, yo, Stace.

11
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,298
What do you want?

12
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,266
Uh, Red-eye large.

13
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,502
What's up, Nicky?

14
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,939
Can we get two large
Red-eyes... in uh...

15
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,908
Sure thing. Yeah. In to-go cups.

16
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:04,946
So does photographing
unsuspecting girls constitute art for you?

17
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:07,815
It's a little creepy.

18
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:08,916
Creepy?

19
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,585
Yeah. Creepy.

20
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,420
Let me show you something.

21
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:16,289
Can I invade your space for a
sec?

22
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:19,259
Invade away.

23
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:22,630
Do me a favor.

24
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:25,032
Hold this knob and turn it

25
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:28,435
so it gets really close to your
eyes.

26
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,538
Alright, you see that? Yeah.
You got my scar.

27
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:32,006
You got a scar. Where?

28
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:37,678
Me too.

29
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,987
But, uh, that's not what I'm
talking about.

30
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:47,821
Look again.

31
00:04:48,256 --> 00:04:50,390
What am I looking at?

32
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,593
How crystal clear the focus is.

33
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:53,861
Yes, it's very crystal.

34
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:57,031
Yeah, see...

35
00:04:57,565 --> 00:05:00,935
A regular person wouldn't
just hold that pose for so long.

36
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:03,838
Kind of feels...

37
00:05:04,172 --> 00:05:05,706
unnatural.

38
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:08,910
Usually when I shoot candid
shots, the subject would be moving

39
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,854
One inch this way, one inch the
other.

40
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:13,480
You lose the focus.

41
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:16,316
I lose the shot. OK.

42
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,753
You know what this feels like?

43
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:21,388
No. Educate me.

44
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,021
It almost feels like you stood
still because you knew I was there.

45
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:28,896
Like... maybe you liked it.

46
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:33,668
Here y'all.

47
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,937
Two large Red-eyes to go.

48
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,705
Oh, thank you so much.

49
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:39,607
Keep the change, alright?

50
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:43,978
You want to go for a smoke and a
walk?

51
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,080
I'm good with sitting.

52
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:47,114
What?

53
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:48,649
You don't like walking?

54
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:49,683
Not really.

55
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,954
Makes me feel closer to home.

56
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:55,690
Are you trying to take me on an
adventure?

57
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:56,723
Yeah.

58
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:58,593
Yeah

59
00:05:58,626 --> 00:05:59,927
You ever hear of those, uh,

60
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:01,461
7-Eleven adventures?

61
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,530
No.

62
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:04,165
It's pretty wild.

63
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,567
All the cool kids are doing it.

64
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:07,601
You in?

65
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:28,522
Can I ask you a personal
question?

66
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:29,090
Sure.

67
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:31,792
So your pictures are very good.

68
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:35,062
What the fuck are you doing
photographing

69
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:38,498
shitty fucking SoundCloud
rappers?

70
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:41,202
This way. They were respected
musicians from East Los Angeles

71
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,703
thank you very much.

72
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:44,505
And to answer your question...

73
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:45,539
They paid me in pills.

74
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:46,641
You like pills?

75
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:49,777
I like the occasional trip to
Mars and back.

76
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,212
That's interesting.

77
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,180
Could be an adventure.

78
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,518
Yeah, maybe.

79
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,922
OK, this is me.

80
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:02,723
OK.

81
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:07,962
No, I live here.

82
00:07:08,296 --> 00:07:10,631
Yeah, no I gathered, weirdo.

83
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,076
Do you need me to order you like
a ride or something?

84
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,435
No. I'll keep doing the Chicago
thing.

85
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:22,777
Hey, Nicky.

86
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,476
Yeah?

87
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:26,047
I did know you were watching.

88
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,148
You were right.

89
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,518
Right about what?

90
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:31,852
I liked it.

91
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:45,566
Hey, Ma.

92
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,868
Yeah, no, I'm on my
way to a shoot right now.

93
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:49,904
I can't really talk, alright?

94
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:52,139
Yeah no, the money's good. It's
a good shoot.

95
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:55,042
I got to pull up. Tell...

96
00:07:55,076 --> 00:07:56,677
Yeah, tell Pop I said hi,
alright?

97
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:58,212
OK.

98
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:00,681
Hey, I love you ma. Bye.

99
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:45,826
Fuck.

100
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,294
It's too soft. Come on, Nicky.

101
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:49,263
You piece of shit.

102
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:54,035
That's not bad.

103
00:08:58,873 --> 00:08:59,740
Hey, fuck face.

104
00:08:59,774 --> 00:09:01,075
Hey, man.

105
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,946
So, what's this big fucking
news?

106
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,216
I got you a job,
and the pay is really great.

107
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,218
Just me? You're not going to be
in it?

108
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:12,686
No.

109
00:09:14,188 --> 00:09:15,122
OK, what is it?

110
00:09:15,156 --> 00:09:16,657
It's for Elixir magazine.

111
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,059
Holy... it's crap...

112
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:19,460
It's a shit magazine.

113
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:23,097
All about high key lighting
women in nothing next to nothing for

114
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,698
no fucking reason.

115
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:27,701
First off, that is not always
true.

116
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:29,703
And second, what the fuck

117
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:32,149
are you calling all these little cash
shoots that you're doing for spare change?

118
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:33,607
It's not me saying anything.

119
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:35,776
It's just point... and shoot some
shit.

120
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,744
That's it.

121
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:41,315
OK, well the spare change on
this one is 10K.

122
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:43,884
Still not interested, but thank
you.

123
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:46,353
Don't do that. Nicky!

124
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:47,888
Nicky, seriously.

125
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:51,058
Dude, you are way too fucking talented
to not be moving this shit forward.

126
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:54,372
I didn't move out here to go down someone
else's path and neither the fuck did you.

127
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:57,898
See, this is why I'm glad we
met.

128
00:09:58,232 --> 00:09:59,232
We see eye to eye.

129
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:01,769
Yeah yeah yeah. Go fuck
yourself.

130
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:02,636
OK, I got to bail.

131
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,737
I've got a shoot.

132
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:09,977
What else we got?

133
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,645
What else we got?

134
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:24,191
Shit.

135
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:25,225
Shit.

136
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:33,033
Jesus Christ.

137
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:34,067
Alright.

138
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:39,240
Coming. Fuck.

139
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:53,220
I come bearing gifts.

140
00:10:57,725 --> 00:10:58,725
Fuck.

141
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,363
Alright, now this is creepy.

142
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:07,377
Wait. How the fuck did you get
in here?

143
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:10,971
Door's fucked. Did you take all
these?

144
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:12,005
Yeah.

145
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:17,044
Oh, Nicky from Chicago can take
a picture.

146
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:20,247
OK, we have to get you out of
here

147
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:23,284
and, as luck would have it,
I come with a plan.

148
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:27,788
What exactly are we talking
about?

149
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:31,458
The People Who Actually
Fucking Live Life intro to L.A.

150
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:33,127
The No Bullshit tour.

151
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,095
No, I got a shit ton of work to
do.

152
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:37,798
No, you don't. Yeah, I do.

153
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,969
And also, I'm not into corny
fucking tours.

154
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,738
Well, are you into corny fucking
tours

155
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:46,373
on drugs?

156
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,982
Maybe a little.

157
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,055
Mm. That's what I thought.

158
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:08,362
No fucking way. This might be
the cheesiest fucking thing.

159
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,296
Yeah.

160
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,732
Isn't that what first dates
consist of?

161
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,169
Oh. So this is official, huh?

162
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:17,905
Maybe, if you're lucky.

163
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:23,410
OK, if this is the No Bullshit tour, then
I'm definitely gonna need more Molly.

164
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,947
Oh this? This is what you want?

165
00:12:27,348 --> 00:12:28,348
Yeah.

166
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:30,518
Alright,

167
00:12:30,552 --> 00:12:32,219
surfing is definitely a thing.

168
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:33,921
It's my thing.

169
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:37,114
And it will soon be done by all of the
tragically interesting people everywhere.

170
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:39,493
If you say so.

171
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:43,797
I still say it's dangerous, pushy as
fuck, and probably, probably illegal.

172
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:47,101
You like those drugs, right?

173
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:48,134
Yeah.

174
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:50,337
It's a little hypocritical.

175
00:12:51,506 --> 00:12:52,506
Fine.

176
00:12:53,508 --> 00:12:54,942
Yes, Tessa.

177
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:58,178
Yes, I like the drugs. Hmm. Hmm.

178
00:13:06,588 --> 00:13:08,022
OK, so let's recap.

179
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:10,257
We got a little adventure.

180
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,527
Yeah. A lot of comedy.

181
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,161
Debatable.

182
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:16,497
And we're about to have
an epically romantic kiss

183
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:19,099
in the best view in all of Los
Angeles.

184
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:38,352
That wasn't cheesy, was it?

185
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:41,556
It was a little fucking cheesy.

186
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:07,381
What are you thinking about?

187
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:09,551
Champagne! No, fuck off. Why?

188
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:12,386
You've been in
LA for fucking far too long.

189
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,254
Champagne shots. Tequila? Yes.

190
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:15,523
Whiskey? Yes. Champagne?

191
00:14:15,557 --> 00:14:17,024
No fucking way.

192
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:19,059
OK, fine. We'll toss a coin.

193
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:22,930
Heads, champagne. Tails,
whatever fucking shot

194
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:25,499
you need to feel like a tough
guy,

195
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:27,635
Tough Guy. OK, fine.

196
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:31,405
But I'm tossing the coin
because I don't fucking trust you.

197
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,740
Ready? Fuck!

198
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:39,012
(Clears throat) Champagne,
please!

199
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,069
Really? (Chuckling)

200
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:49,016
Oh! That is fucking disgusting.
Your face!

201
00:16:11,606 --> 00:16:15,976
(Sniffing) (Laughing) Alright,
what do you want to do next?

202
00:16:16,778 --> 00:16:18,111
I want to dance.

203
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:18,713
You can dance?

204
00:16:18,746 --> 00:16:19,714
Oh yes. I can dance.

205
00:16:19,747 --> 00:16:21,749
I might be the best dancer in
the whole world.

206
00:16:21,783 --> 00:16:24,184
I move like a fucking fish in
water.

207
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:25,596
I fucking believe you. Can you
teach me?

208
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,096
Yeah, of course. What's going on
in there?

209
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,089
We're coming out to dance, man!

210
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,463
You're so damn good.

211
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:10,798
Sure.

212
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:11,832
No, I mean it. I mean it.

213
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,403
You need to be sharing this
point of view.

214
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:20,708
No, seriously, I've worked
with so many shooters.

215
00:17:20,742 --> 00:17:24,278
And none of them have, like,
a tenth of your talent.

216
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:32,452
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Blah.

217
00:17:33,855 --> 00:17:34,855
Really? Hmm.

218
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:38,125
That's my favorite photo.

219
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:41,128
Look at those fucking eyes.

220
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:43,162
OK, enough of that crap.

221
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:48,703
I don't know what to think of
you.

222
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:54,576
Good.

223
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:57,579
Kind of...

224
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,548
Kind of scare me a little bit.

225
00:18:00,582 --> 00:18:01,582
Good. Yeah.

226
00:18:01,616 --> 00:18:02,249
Good.

227
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:05,553
Mm Hmm.

228
00:18:34,582 --> 00:18:37,585
(Laughing) Fucking jeans.
Fucking jeans.

229
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:04,108
What are you doing? Don't move,
don't move, don't move.

230
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:04,665
No, I look horrible.

231
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:06,934
I have morning breath.

232
00:21:08,503 --> 00:21:10,905
First of all, you're gorgeous.

233
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:13,775
And second of all, I promise
not to photograph your breath.

234
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:17,512
You are so fucking beautiful.

235
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:31,424
I'm gonna go get a coffee. You
want one?

236
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,458
Yes, please.

237
00:21:32,994 --> 00:21:33,994
Alright.

238
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,728
Hey, I forgot my wallet.

239
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:13,432
Tessa.

240
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:22,475
Why are you going through my
photos?

241
00:22:25,713 --> 00:22:26,346
Nick,

242
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:27,882
I just thought I could help.

243
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:33,554
Help?

244
00:22:33,588 --> 00:22:35,923
No, Tessa. What the fuck are you
doing?

245
00:22:37,725 --> 00:22:38,993
I was emailing

246
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:41,996
my designer friend Rudy
some of your photo series.

247
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:45,533
Who? Who the...

248
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:48,169
Who the fuck is Rudy?

249
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:51,939
Rudy is a friend, and I think
he'd really like your vibe.

250
00:22:51,973 --> 00:22:54,407
And maybe he'd bring you in
to shoot his new line.

251
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:55,442
No, no, no, no.

252
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:58,646
Fuck that shit, Tessa. You
don't...

253
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:01,716
You don't fucking go through my
shit and send it to fucking anybody

254
00:23:01,749 --> 00:23:03,017
without asking me first.

255
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,862
OK, you need to calm down
because you're yelling right now.

256
00:23:04,886 --> 00:23:06,954
You see that, right? Yelling?

257
00:23:07,154 --> 00:23:07,822
How am I yelling?

258
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:10,390
You're going through my shit!

259
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,059
You're fucking welcome.

260
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:20,094
Tessa, hey, um...

261
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:22,930
I'm sorry, OK?

262
00:24:23,731 --> 00:24:24,165
I just

263
00:24:24,198 --> 00:24:25,198
I get...

264
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,535
a little fucking crazy

265
00:24:27,568 --> 00:24:30,004
sometimes and I just

266
00:24:31,072 --> 00:24:32,873
I... I was an asshole.

267
00:24:37,812 --> 00:24:41,248
Could you, could you please
forgive me?

268
00:24:41,882 --> 00:24:43,962
I didn't mean it. I didn't mean
it. I didn't mean it.

269
00:24:58,833 --> 00:24:59,833
Come on. Come on.

270
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,805
Come here.

271
00:25:41,342 --> 00:25:45,312
Tell me you're not obsessing
over those photos. Shut it.

272
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,888
Huh?

273
00:25:56,624 --> 00:25:59,794
What? What's up?

274
00:26:00,995 --> 00:26:02,930
Nothing.

275
00:26:15,676 --> 00:26:18,612
Alright. Where I'm from people
don't get

276
00:26:18,646 --> 00:26:19,280
what I'm doing.

277
00:26:19,313 --> 00:26:20,313
Actually,

278
00:26:21,082 --> 00:26:22,249
my mother

279
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,053
she understood, right?

280
00:26:26,087 --> 00:26:27,588
But my father...

281
00:26:28,055 --> 00:26:29,232
when I told him about my phot-

282
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:30,758
photography.

283
00:26:31,892 --> 00:26:34,128
The only thing he said to me was

284
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:39,700
I hope you like the taste of
black beans.

285
00:26:39,733 --> 00:26:40,733
Meaning...

286
00:26:42,937 --> 00:26:43,604
he didn't really think

287
00:26:43,637 --> 00:26:45,673
I was going to amount to much.

288
00:26:46,841 --> 00:26:48,909
I guess I'm trying to say...

289
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:52,746
Thanks for understanding.

290
00:26:54,415 --> 00:26:55,415
You know?

291
00:27:07,728 --> 00:27:08,929
OK, you're ready.

292
00:27:13,134 --> 00:27:14,802
Ready for what?

293
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:21,308
Hey, how are you?

294
00:27:21,342 --> 00:27:23,711
(Grunting) Good to see you, this
is Nicky. Come on.

295
00:27:24,979 --> 00:27:25,412
What's up, man?

296
00:27:25,446 --> 00:27:29,216
(Unintelligible)

297
00:28:57,438 --> 00:28:58,438
Oh.

298
00:28:59,206 --> 00:29:03,010
(Moaning)

299
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:11,318
(Moaning)

300
00:29:11,553 --> 00:29:13,363
(Heavy breathing) Is that thing
still recording?

301
00:29:13,387 --> 00:29:16,357
Uh huh. (Laughter)

302
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:40,180
(Unintelligible What?
Good?)

303
00:29:45,085 --> 00:29:48,856
Ooh. Mmm. That's gross.

304
00:30:03,237 --> 00:30:04,271
I want to

305
00:30:04,305 --> 00:30:06,225
Introduce you to Nemo. Where is
that little slut?

306
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:08,842
Oh, there he is. Come, come on.

307
00:30:08,876 --> 00:30:10,578
Nemo!

308
00:30:11,646 --> 00:30:14,214
Sammy! Honey. Gorgeous.

309
00:30:14,248 --> 00:30:15,449
Mmmm.

310
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:18,352
Look at you. You're beautiful.
This gold dress. Thank you.

311
00:30:18,385 --> 00:30:21,021
Can I borrow it? If you
can fit your little tush in it.

312
00:30:21,055 --> 00:30:23,891
You know I can.
How are you? I'm good.

313
00:30:23,924 --> 00:30:26,102
You know, just spicing things up. While
more basic bitches flood the catwalk.

314
00:30:26,126 --> 00:30:28,028
Oh my God, talking about basic
bitches,

315
00:30:28,062 --> 00:30:29,463
look at these basic bitches.

316
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:30,397
Here, come with me.

317
00:30:30,431 --> 00:30:33,033
Did you know that everyone is a
cunt here?

318
00:30:33,067 --> 00:30:35,235
Cunt, Cunt, Cunt, C-

319
00:30:36,437 --> 00:30:39,873
Who's your handsome
cutie pie of a friend?

320
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:41,008
And why haven't I seen you

321
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:42,309
at one of my poisonous soirees.

322
00:30:42,343 --> 00:30:44,345
Wait, I know you. I do

323
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,949
I had sex with you in a dream
once.

324
00:30:48,982 --> 00:30:51,619
Meow. What's your name again?
Uh, Nemo,

325
00:30:51,653 --> 00:30:56,490
this is the photographer slash
brilliant artist that I told you about. Oh?

326
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:59,093
Nick Gatto, man. K. It's a
pleasure meeting you.

327
00:30:59,126 --> 00:31:00,327
Yeah.

328
00:31:01,261 --> 00:31:03,263
Yeah. I'm a big fan of your
lines, man.

329
00:31:03,297 --> 00:31:04,865
Ping, ping, ping. Ping.
Especially...

330
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,067
Especially the sneakers.

331
00:31:07,101 --> 00:31:10,070
Boring. Is he party trained?

332
00:31:10,104 --> 00:31:11,372
I guess he is.

333
00:31:11,405 --> 00:31:13,006
How dare you,

334
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,577
OK? How dare you come to this
party,

335
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:18,646
take my friend, drinking my
champagne.

336
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,913
Look at me.

337
00:31:19,947 --> 00:31:22,383
Yeah, I see you in those bedroom

338
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:25,018
eyes, those cherry lips,
and you have the nerve

339
00:31:25,553 --> 00:31:28,489
to think that somehow
I'm going to give you a job?

340
00:31:29,557 --> 00:31:31,191
Is that what you think?

341
00:31:31,793 --> 00:31:34,161
Well, you're right, it's your
lucky day.

342
00:31:34,696 --> 00:31:36,631
I'm going to give you a job.

343
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:40,134
I'm going to give you a blow job.

344
00:31:43,571 --> 00:31:45,072
Why did you laugh?

345
00:31:45,105 --> 00:31:47,174
Sorry, it was too much. A
blow job?

346
00:31:47,207 --> 00:31:49,476
I could have carried on.
You. Listen, man.

347
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:50,554
We were fucking with you, man.

348
00:31:50,578 --> 00:31:51,679
You were fucking with me?

349
00:31:51,713 --> 00:31:53,947
Truly. I'm sorry, man. She was
alright.

350
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:55,225
Hey, listen, I have seen your
work.

351
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:58,285
Is it like, Chicago inspired or
L.A.?

352
00:31:58,318 --> 00:31:59,420
What's the deal?

353
00:31:59,721 --> 00:32:02,456
Yeah, I shot some of it
in Chicago and some of it here.

354
00:32:03,424 --> 00:32:05,092
And I moved to L.A.

355
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:07,437
because I'm trying to fucking figure
out, you know, where it's going. Hey mate,

356
00:32:07,461 --> 00:32:09,531
We're all trying to figure out
what's going on.

357
00:32:09,731 --> 00:32:12,065
I believe in you. You're here,
right?

358
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:12,933
Yeah. You're in town?

359
00:32:12,966 --> 00:32:14,736
Yeah. You're going to put us in
contact?

360
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:16,538
Definitely.
Keep sending me your stuff, man.

361
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:17,404
Keep doing it and

362
00:32:17,438 --> 00:32:19,239
maybe, you know, we'll do
something.

363
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:20,273
Wait.

364
00:32:21,008 --> 00:32:22,008
What?

365
00:32:23,778 --> 00:32:24,378
Are you fucking with me?

366
00:32:24,411 --> 00:32:25,580
I'm not fucking with you.

367
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:26,514
You're fucking with me? Im not
fucking with you anymore.

368
00:32:26,548 --> 00:32:29,049
Seriously,
I want to do something. Alright?

369
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:29,617
I dig it, man.

370
00:32:29,651 --> 00:32:31,218
For real, OK?

371
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:33,420
Yes? Yeah. I'm not fucking with
you.

372
00:32:33,454 --> 00:32:34,254
You're great.

373
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:35,088
I love you.

374
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:36,123
Good to see you.

375
00:32:36,156 --> 00:32:37,958
I'm going to go mingle with
these douche bags.

376
00:32:38,392 --> 00:32:40,595
I fucking love you.

377
00:32:41,663 --> 00:32:44,164
Thank you. You're welcome.

378
00:32:44,198 --> 00:32:47,201
Now, let's both go get laid,
shall we?

379
00:32:47,602 --> 00:32:48,602
Yes. Thank you.

380
00:33:32,312 --> 00:33:34,649
So what exactly is your plan for
me, sir?

381
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,687
You know, I was thinking

382
00:33:39,721 --> 00:33:43,023
that this just isn't really working out,
so we should probably just call it quits.

383
00:33:43,892 --> 00:33:46,360
Yeah, I was thinking the same
thing.

384
00:33:46,393 --> 00:33:47,393
Good.

385
00:33:49,731 --> 00:33:52,667
Because I can't stand you.

386
00:35:36,971 --> 00:35:38,171
Tessa.

387
00:35:41,241 --> 00:35:42,376
Tessa, you,

388
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:45,178
you gotta talk to me here.

389
00:35:48,816 --> 00:35:49,282
Come on.

390
00:35:49,316 --> 00:35:51,251
Please talk to me.

391
00:35:52,887 --> 00:35:54,254
Please. Who...

392
00:35:54,287 --> 00:35:56,524
Who were those guys?

393
00:36:04,866 --> 00:36:06,601
I'm gonna have to get out.

394
00:36:09,804 --> 00:36:10,804
What?

395
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:14,676
I'm going to have to get out of
L.A.

396
00:36:19,346 --> 00:36:22,650
No. Mm mmm.

397
00:36:22,684 --> 00:36:24,384
Tessa, you can trust me.

398
00:36:24,418 --> 00:36:24,986
You know that, right?

399
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:26,353
You can, you can...

400
00:36:26,386 --> 00:36:28,255
You can trust me.

401
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:29,791
Come on.

402
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,693
Just tell me what the fuck is
going on.

403
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:47,809
When I first got to LA,

404
00:36:49,043 --> 00:36:52,814
(Sniffling) I went to a party

405
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:55,717
in the hills

406
00:36:59,419 --> 00:37:03,457
and it was the end of the night.

407
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:06,426
I was about to call a ride.

408
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,529
I... lost consciousness. And...

409
00:37:13,968 --> 00:37:15,368
My next

410
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,740
memory is by a pool.

411
00:37:21,843 --> 00:37:24,311
I was completely naked on a pool
chair.

412
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:29,550
And the youngest one, his name's
Matteo,

413
00:37:30,585 --> 00:37:31,886
he kissed me.

414
00:37:35,523 --> 00:37:38,258
It's really confusing because
the way

415
00:37:39,594 --> 00:37:41,428
that he was with me was, like,

416
00:37:41,461 --> 00:37:44,431
I was forgetting that (Gulping)

417
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:48,536
like we were already together or
something.

418
00:37:49,402 --> 00:37:54,909
And...(Gulping) I remember us
having sex

419
00:37:58,445 --> 00:37:59,479
but it didn't...

420
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:02,683
didn't feel like rape

421
00:38:02,717 --> 00:38:04,752
because he was being sweet.

422
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,523
And, well, I was out of it.

423
00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:11,391
And I know that because

424
00:38:11,626 --> 00:38:15,029
my next memory is the tatted up

425
00:38:15,062 --> 00:38:17,031
one on top of me.

426
00:38:19,767 --> 00:38:21,569
He was so much bigger than me.

427
00:38:21,602 --> 00:38:23,738
He was rough and aggressive.

428
00:38:28,943 --> 00:38:31,344
And then the next one.

429
00:38:33,548 --> 00:38:35,917
It just went from,

430
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:39,319
like, confusing to a fucking
nightmare.

431
00:38:41,055 --> 00:38:44,625
Like, how did I not remember
anything?

432
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:48,361
How was I so fucked up?

433
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:56,671
I remember them laughing and

434
00:38:56,704 --> 00:38:57,705
they were taking

435
00:38:58,471 --> 00:39:00,808
photos and videos because I'd
come to

436
00:39:00,842 --> 00:39:03,410
and seen, like, a phone in my
face.

437
00:39:07,615 --> 00:39:09,917
And it was fucking just a blur.
And...

438
00:39:15,823 --> 00:39:17,859
I'm so sorry.

439
00:39:17,892 --> 00:39:19,026
I'm sorry.

440
00:39:23,865 --> 00:39:27,134
Did, did you go to the police?

441
00:39:27,668 --> 00:39:28,736
I tried.

442
00:39:31,672 --> 00:39:33,440
So what happened to them?

443
00:39:33,473 --> 00:39:36,744
I tracked down

444
00:39:36,777 --> 00:39:40,014
the girl who invited me, and
she told me who these people are.

445
00:39:41,582 --> 00:39:42,617
Nicky, they're not

446
00:39:43,017 --> 00:39:45,720
the kind of people
you can just get arrested

447
00:39:45,753 --> 00:39:47,555
and then it's over.

448
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:57,798
So, you think your only option
is to... is to...

449
00:39:59,466 --> 00:39:59,967
leave L.A.

450
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:03,671
and run from this?

451
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:06,741
I can't. I can't. I...

452
00:40:08,475 --> 00:40:11,979
I told myself that it was over.

453
00:40:12,013 --> 00:40:15,182
You know, it was just like a
fuckin', a crazy

454
00:40:16,851 --> 00:40:19,854
fucking situation
I got myself into with people

455
00:40:20,288 --> 00:40:22,890
from another world
and I'd never see them again.

456
00:40:22,924 --> 00:40:26,127
And I would never put
myself in that position. And...

457
00:40:27,628 --> 00:40:30,197
they were fucking there. They
were there,

458
00:40:30,398 --> 00:40:31,398
Nicky.

459
00:40:31,832 --> 00:40:33,500
And they saw me.
(Unintelligible)

460
00:40:34,735 --> 00:40:36,203
They saw me.

461
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:37,436
OK,

462
00:40:37,905 --> 00:40:40,384
we'll pack up the car right now
and we'll get the fuck out of here.

463
00:40:40,408 --> 00:40:41,075
We're out of here.

464
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:44,145
I'm not asking you to do that.

465
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:01,629
Nicky. (Sniffling) I've never
met anyone like you.

466
00:41:06,934 --> 00:41:08,903
Somewhere in the middle
of the past few weeks

467
00:41:08,936 --> 00:41:11,038
I fell in love with you.

468
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:14,841
Me too.

469
00:41:16,077 --> 00:41:20,648
But, um... seeing them...

470
00:41:20,848 --> 00:41:24,552
It just, it made me realize it
wasn't

471
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:28,255
a fucking dream or nightmare.

472
00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:32,059
Its real, you know, and I can't
bury it and I...

473
00:41:34,662 --> 00:41:36,897
They're fucking animals, Nicky.

474
00:41:37,965 --> 00:41:40,634
No.

475
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:41,802
I can't.

476
00:41:41,836 --> 00:41:44,105
I can't imagine you're not here.

477
00:41:45,773 --> 00:41:47,074
I don't want to lose you.

478
00:41:47,108 --> 00:41:49,543
Don't leave, don't leave me.

479
00:41:49,577 --> 00:41:52,146
Because I, I, I...

480
00:41:52,446 --> 00:41:53,581
I need you.

481
00:41:53,614 --> 00:41:54,614
I do.

482
00:41:57,151 --> 00:42:00,121
Do you need me?

483
00:42:03,024 --> 00:42:05,526
Do you love me?

484
00:42:06,727 --> 00:42:07,727
Of course I do.

485
00:42:10,031 --> 00:42:11,031
Then kill them.

486
00:42:19,774 --> 00:42:21,709
They don't deserve to breathe.

487
00:42:29,116 --> 00:42:31,919
(Grunting) They don't deserve to
breathe.

488
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,160
Tessa,

489
00:42:43,731 --> 00:42:45,599
are you hearing yourself?

490
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:50,104
You're asking me to kill people.

491
00:42:54,809 --> 00:42:56,310
I... I ca-

492
00:42:56,343 --> 00:42:59,880
I'm asking you to love me enough
to protect me from animals.

493
00:43:09,223 --> 00:43:11,092
I... I can't.

494
00:43:12,393 --> 00:43:15,362
I just, I...

495
00:43:17,064 --> 00:43:19,100
I can't, I can't do that.

496
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,176
Hey, hey, I understand, I
understand.

497
00:43:30,077 --> 00:43:31,077
Yeah. No.

498
00:43:33,147 --> 00:43:34,147
Yeah.

499
00:43:34,215 --> 00:43:36,083
Please, please, Tessa,

500
00:43:36,117 --> 00:43:37,618
where are you going? I don't
know.

501
00:43:37,952 --> 00:43:40,020
I can't stay here. Yes, you can.

502
00:43:40,054 --> 00:43:42,223
No, I can't. You have a choice
here.

503
00:43:42,524 --> 00:43:43,767
I don't have a choice. Yes, you
do. No, I don't.

504
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:44,225
I don't.

505
00:43:44,258 --> 00:43:44,725
I fucking

506
00:43:44,758 --> 00:43:45,926
don't! Yes, you...

507
00:44:54,995 --> 00:44:56,830
Hey, how you doing?

508
00:44:56,864 --> 00:44:59,266
Hey, where the fuck are our
girls?

509
00:44:59,601 --> 00:45:01,168
I pitched our girls. But the
brand,

510
00:45:01,202 --> 00:45:03,180
You know, they handle casting.
They do what they want.

511
00:45:03,204 --> 00:45:04,705
You know how it is.

512
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:06,273
Who's that?

513
00:45:06,307 --> 00:45:07,408
It's Vincent.

514
00:45:08,275 --> 00:45:10,077
Did he hire these girls?

515
00:45:10,277 --> 00:45:12,122
He might have had a say. It's,
look, he's great.

516
00:45:12,146 --> 00:45:14,248
They're great. I talked to
them. They're really nice.

517
00:45:14,516 --> 00:45:17,027
Look, I know it's not what you
expected, but they're really cool.

518
00:45:17,051 --> 00:45:18,018
I talked to them.

519
00:45:18,052 --> 00:45:20,187
No, this is... This is... This is
bullshit, Sam.

520
00:45:21,222 --> 00:45:23,490
Look, it's just one day.

521
00:45:24,191 --> 00:45:27,127
And you can just do your thing.

522
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:29,863
I'll figure it out.

523
00:45:38,272 --> 00:45:39,173
Is he alright?

524
00:45:39,206 --> 00:45:40,374
Yeah, he's great.

525
00:46:10,904 --> 00:46:11,904
Eyes.

526
00:46:14,308 --> 00:46:15,385
A little to the right to the
right...

527
00:46:15,409 --> 00:46:16,310
to the right to the right.

528
00:46:16,343 --> 00:46:17,343
Right here.

529
00:46:21,115 --> 00:46:22,850
I want to do some blood effects
on her eyes

530
00:46:22,883 --> 00:46:24,394
but I don't want it to be too
theatrical.

531
00:46:24,418 --> 00:46:26,820
I just want a little bit
under, dripping down.

532
00:46:27,888 --> 00:46:30,124
Like a blanket, like a red
blanket.

533
00:46:33,093 --> 00:46:33,595
Faith,

534
00:46:33,628 --> 00:46:34,862
where's that blood?

535
00:46:48,075 --> 00:46:50,512
Hey man, um, can I get a
quick minute, if that's OK?

536
00:46:50,712 --> 00:46:52,547
Yeah. Sorry about that. Sorry.
Sorry.

537
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:53,814
Just over here. Yeah.

538
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,217
This isn't the aesthetic we
agreed on.

539
00:46:57,251 --> 00:46:58,586
What are you trying to do?

540
00:46:58,787 --> 00:47:01,088
Yeah, I'm just going to pivot.
Pivot?

541
00:47:01,121 --> 00:47:02,524
She's wearing pale makeup.

542
00:47:02,557 --> 00:47:05,025
This is meant to be high
fashion. What's going on here?

543
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:06,059
It's going to be great.

544
00:47:07,995 --> 00:47:08,995
Alright?

545
00:47:09,664 --> 00:47:10,464
Clea, Moira,

546
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:12,132
can I get you over here?

547
00:47:18,205 --> 00:47:18,939
Just down on here?

548
00:47:18,972 --> 00:47:19,507
Yeah.

549
00:47:19,541 --> 00:47:21,075
Let's have you lay down.

550
00:47:23,477 --> 00:47:24,579
Looks great.

551
00:47:26,413 --> 00:47:28,415
Put you over here for a sec.
Alright

552
00:47:28,449 --> 00:47:31,852
what I'm going to do is put
you feet first here. Uh huh.

553
00:47:34,188 --> 00:47:36,190
Get you right down here.

554
00:47:36,223 --> 00:47:39,293
Hey, Faith, can you come here
for a sec?

555
00:47:40,227 --> 00:47:41,387
(Unintelligible) Looks great.

556
00:47:41,596 --> 00:47:42,596
Yeah.

557
00:47:44,031 --> 00:47:45,031
Can I...

558
00:47:47,434 --> 00:47:49,637
(Sigh) Yes.

559
00:47:49,671 --> 00:47:51,573
Both of you look up into... Yup.

560
00:47:51,606 --> 00:47:54,174
Thank you. You guys are great.

561
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:57,177
Bring that arm right back where
it was.

562
00:47:57,211 --> 00:47:59,380
And yup... up.

563
00:47:59,748 --> 00:48:01,516
Hey, I want to talk about this.

564
00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:02,650
It's just another shoot.

565
00:48:02,684 --> 00:48:03,684
Fuck it.

566
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:06,463
That is not what I'm talking
about and

567
00:48:06,487 --> 00:48:09,089
you know that. You are obviously
hurting.

568
00:48:09,123 --> 00:48:12,226
What's going on? It's just
fucking life,

569
00:48:18,465 --> 00:48:21,135
Now, she's gone. (Sniffling)

570
00:48:21,168 --> 00:48:23,003
She's gone. I don't know where
the fuck

571
00:48:23,036 --> 00:48:25,239
she is. She's gone. Look, I'm
sorry to hear that, man,

572
00:48:25,272 --> 00:48:31,011
I am. OK but that shoot was not what we
had talked about and it was some dark shit.

573
00:48:32,413 --> 00:48:33,693
What are you saying? (Sniffling)

574
00:48:33,882 --> 00:48:35,449
You just said it was genius.

575
00:48:35,482 --> 00:48:36,383
And fucking Vince?

576
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:39,353
He loves it. Yeah. So, what's
the issue?

577
00:48:39,386 --> 00:48:40,555
Yes, I did.

578
00:48:40,588 --> 00:48:41,756
And obviously he does.

579
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:44,158
But the point is, I don't
know where it's coming from

580
00:48:44,191 --> 00:48:45,503
and I'm trying to make sure that
you're OK.

581
00:48:45,527 --> 00:48:47,161
Just give me a fucking break,

582
00:48:47,194 --> 00:48:48,194
alright?

583
00:48:59,206 --> 00:49:00,007
Hey, it's Tessa,

584
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,576
leave a message.

585
00:49:04,411 --> 00:49:05,613
Hey, it's me... um...

586
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,652
Could you please just call me
back, huh?

587
00:49:13,187 --> 00:49:14,187
I just I...

588
00:49:14,656 --> 00:49:16,567
I got to hear your voice,
you know, I just got to know

589
00:49:16,591 --> 00:49:18,125
you're alright.

590
00:49:21,295 --> 00:49:21,962
I mean, come on

591
00:49:21,995 --> 00:49:23,197
this can't be it and all that.

592
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,097
You know, you know,

593
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:25,165
you know.

594
00:49:28,502 --> 00:49:31,205
Just please call me back,
alright?

595
00:50:29,429 --> 00:50:30,063
It's OK.

596
00:50:30,097 --> 00:50:32,232
You don't have to come back.

597
00:50:32,266 --> 00:50:34,368
Tessa, come back. Tessa. Tessa,
come back.

598
00:50:34,702 --> 00:50:36,403
Come back. Where are you? Come
back.

599
00:50:36,436 --> 00:50:37,672
Tessa. Where are you?

600
00:50:37,705 --> 00:50:38,705
Tessa.

601
00:50:39,072 --> 00:50:41,341
Come back Tessa, come back.

602
00:50:43,243 --> 00:50:44,579
Please come back.

603
00:51:19,346 --> 00:51:20,346
Tessa...

604
00:51:25,185 --> 00:51:26,453
We've got to find another way.

605
00:51:35,162 --> 00:51:36,162
I can't.

606
00:51:38,833 --> 00:51:40,334
I can't do it.

607
00:51:54,682 --> 00:51:57,417
How could you say you'd
protect me and then betray me?

608
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:00,588
Betray you?

609
00:52:03,625 --> 00:52:04,659
Tessa, I...

610
00:52:05,026 --> 00:52:06,393
I love you.

611
00:52:06,426 --> 00:52:08,295
No, you don't. No, you don't.

612
00:52:08,328 --> 00:52:10,531
No. Yeah. No, you're

613
00:52:10,565 --> 00:52:12,175
just like everyone else, you're
leaving me.

614
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:14,301
Tessa!

615
00:52:14,334 --> 00:52:16,203
I'm trying not to abandon you.

616
00:52:16,236 --> 00:52:19,507
No, I already told you who
these fucking men are, OK?

617
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:23,210
And when they beat this, and
make no fucking mistake, they will,

618
00:52:23,243 --> 00:52:25,312
who do you think they're going
to come after?

619
00:52:51,271 --> 00:52:52,272
I'll do it.

620
00:52:59,714 --> 00:53:01,516
But you can't stay here.

621
00:53:02,684 --> 00:53:04,217
I'm also going to need
everything that

622
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:05,251
you got on 'em.

623
00:54:12,687 --> 00:54:15,022
If this cocksucker's home.

624
00:54:18,025 --> 00:54:19,025
Matteo!

625
00:54:23,564 --> 00:54:26,500
Yo, Matteo!

626
00:54:27,935 --> 00:54:30,037
Fucking call this guy.

627
00:54:34,709 --> 00:54:35,709
Thanks.

628
00:55:12,412 --> 00:55:13,412
Shit.

629
00:55:40,908 --> 00:55:43,044
Hi, uh, can I get two steak
tacos and a horchata?

630
00:58:07,054 --> 00:58:08,054
What's up?

631
00:58:10,024 --> 00:58:11,024
Yeah, nine's good.

632
00:58:12,093 --> 00:58:14,562
No, not tomorrow,
I need to do it tonight.

633
00:58:16,197 --> 00:58:16,697
Yeah, it's just a

634
00:58:16,731 --> 00:58:18,199
lot of shit to move.

635
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:33,614
Who the fuck are you,
motherfucker? (Grunting)

636
00:58:34,215 --> 00:58:36,751
Why you following me, fucker?
(Grunting)

637
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:38,579
Alright, I'm meeting him at
the door right now. Don't worry.

638
00:59:42,383 --> 00:59:43,150
Hey. Hey.

639
00:59:43,184 --> 00:59:44,885
You must be Nick.

640
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:47,388
Thanks for getting here so
quick.

641
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:50,291
We're really excited
to be working with you.

642
00:59:50,324 --> 00:59:52,927
I know Nemo is for sure.

643
00:59:53,562 --> 00:59:56,030
Uh, you can set up anywhere.

644
00:59:58,232 --> 01:00:00,634
Can I get you anything?

645
01:00:01,402 --> 01:00:03,904
Yeah, a water and a...

646
01:00:05,372 --> 01:00:07,374
a Red-eye.

647
01:00:08,175 --> 01:00:10,044
Yeah, of course.

648
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:43,911
Nemo,

649
01:00:43,944 --> 01:00:44,546
we have 30 projects,

650
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:46,313
I can't confirm anything.

651
01:00:46,347 --> 01:00:48,749
This is a solid, this is a solid
idea.

652
01:00:49,216 --> 01:00:50,184
It's not a solid idea. I'm not
going to approve.

653
01:00:50,217 --> 01:00:51,361
Find me something interesting.

654
01:00:51,385 --> 01:00:53,320
Otherwise, I'm not interested.

655
01:00:53,622 --> 01:00:56,056
Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick. Nick.
Hey, man.

656
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:57,767
Thanks for doing this
last minute. I appreciate it.

657
01:00:57,791 --> 01:01:00,951
I really do. You know, it's like I said
on the message, I want you to (Inhaling)

658
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:05,299
Run with this. Nick, Nick, you
with me?

659
01:01:05,332 --> 01:01:06,734
What happened to your lip?

660
01:01:06,934 --> 01:01:08,135
(Grunting)

661
01:01:08,435 --> 01:01:09,435
Huh?

662
01:01:10,204 --> 01:01:11,906
Oh yeah, I get it.

663
01:01:12,173 --> 01:01:13,774
Art.

664
01:01:13,807 --> 01:01:15,843
Oh, Sammy, where's Sammy?

665
01:01:17,845 --> 01:01:19,046
Oh, she's sick.

666
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:20,281
Well, who brought these girls?

667
01:01:20,314 --> 01:01:22,049
Are these? Sasha? Yeah.

668
01:01:22,082 --> 01:01:23,350
The fuck are these girls?

669
01:01:23,384 --> 01:01:24,427
We had to book them last minute.

670
01:01:24,451 --> 01:01:26,787
We booked them? Yeah.
But they're fine. Shhh.

671
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:27,855
Don't embarrass them.

672
01:01:28,389 --> 01:01:29,389
Nick.

673
01:01:29,456 --> 01:01:30,758
Hey, listen to me.

674
01:01:31,425 --> 01:01:32,936
Do you like these girls? I can
change these girls

675
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,471
If you don't like these girls.
Don't be shy.

676
01:01:34,495 --> 01:01:37,274
Just tell me the truth. I can give a
fuck about these girls. I can get you

677
01:01:37,298 --> 01:01:38,098
nice girls.

678
01:01:38,132 --> 01:01:38,633
No, they're great.

679
01:01:38,667 --> 01:01:41,335
You sure? Yeah. OK.

680
01:01:42,169 --> 01:01:43,169
Be free.

681
01:01:45,406 --> 01:01:46,840
Inspire me.

682
01:01:55,482 --> 01:01:57,318
Why you following me, fucker?

683
01:01:59,954 --> 01:02:01,364
These are the best shoes
in the fucking world,

684
01:02:01,388 --> 01:02:03,791
alright? Knife up
like you've held a knife before.

685
01:02:03,824 --> 01:02:04,959
Yeah, right there.

686
01:02:06,093 --> 01:02:07,928
What the fuck do you want?

687
01:02:07,962 --> 01:02:10,264
You thought you could fuck with
me, huh?

688
01:02:10,297 --> 01:02:11,298
Just be natural

689
01:02:11,332 --> 01:02:13,867
that's all I fucking need,
alright? Don't act.

690
01:02:14,101 --> 01:02:16,303
Be natural. Alright?

691
01:02:16,337 --> 01:02:17,838
Fuck you. (Grunting)

692
01:02:18,172 --> 01:02:21,308
Close, close, close, fucking
closing.

693
01:02:32,152 --> 01:02:33,152
(Grunting)

694
01:02:33,555 --> 01:02:34,555
(Grunting)

695
01:02:35,889 --> 01:02:43,889
Groaning

696
01:02:44,532 --> 01:02:47,268
Groaning

697
01:03:20,267 --> 01:03:22,269
I'm asking you this one time.

698
01:03:22,537 --> 01:03:23,772
Why'd you kill Victor?

699
01:03:23,804 --> 01:03:26,840
What the fuck do you want
from us? I don't know anything!

700
01:03:26,874 --> 01:03:28,242
It was a fucking accident!

701
01:03:28,275 --> 01:03:30,854
It was an accident! Tell me what
you're talking about... I don't know!

702
01:03:30,878 --> 01:03:32,846
I don't kn-Why?

703
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,288
FUCK!

704
01:03:41,322 --> 01:03:44,391
FUUUUCK!

705
01:04:03,578 --> 01:04:06,347
Pick up your phone, pick up your
fucking phone,

706
01:04:08,315 --> 01:04:10,351
pick up your fucking phone.

707
01:04:10,384 --> 01:04:11,485
Pick it.

708
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:16,323
Hey, it's Tessa, leave a
message.

709
01:04:16,357 --> 01:04:22,429
Tessa. (Grunting) Tessa, it's
Nicky.

710
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:24,031
Pick up your phone.

711
01:04:24,064 --> 01:04:28,202
Pick up your fucking phone,
please.

712
01:04:28,235 --> 01:04:31,004
Pick up your fucking phone!

713
01:04:31,038 --> 01:04:33,474
Please! Pick it up!

714
01:04:33,508 --> 01:04:35,008
Pick up your fucking phone!

715
01:04:35,042 --> 01:04:38,445
Where the fuck are you?
Pick up your fucking phone!

716
01:05:19,319 --> 01:05:22,089
Hey, Ma.

717
01:05:22,423 --> 01:05:23,591
Yeah. No, no, I'm fine...

718
01:05:23,625 --> 01:05:24,158
I'm fine.

719
01:05:24,191 --> 01:05:26,493
Yeah, I'm just calling

720
01:05:28,362 --> 01:05:29,531
I uh...

721
01:05:29,898 --> 01:05:31,599
I just miss you, that's all.

722
01:05:31,633 --> 01:05:32,132
You know?

723
01:05:32,166 --> 01:05:33,535
I miss you and uh...

Yeah.

725
01:05:37,505 --> 01:05:38,606
No, no, don't...

726
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,110
Don't worry about me, you know?

727
01:05:43,143 --> 01:05:45,012
Yeah, is Pop there?

728
01:05:45,045 --> 01:05:45,513
Let me. I just.

729
01:05:45,547 --> 01:05:46,246
Yeah, I'm fine.

730
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,280
I'm fine.

731
01:05:51,786 --> 01:05:54,087
Hey, Pop.

732
01:05:59,493 --> 01:06:00,493
Yeah.

733
01:06:03,565 --> 01:06:05,432
Hey, Pop, uh...

734
01:06:07,234 --> 01:06:09,336
You know I love you, right?

735
01:06:11,305 --> 01:06:12,305
Yeah.

736
01:06:13,741 --> 01:06:15,777
Yeah, I got to go. OK.

737
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:16,443
Alright.

738
01:06:16,477 --> 01:06:17,712
Bye.

739
01:07:54,374 --> 01:07:55,208
Motherfucker,

740
01:07:55,242 --> 01:07:56,520
I was outside your place for an
hour.

741
01:07:56,544 --> 01:07:57,845
Call me back.

742
01:08:13,595 --> 01:08:15,555
Fucking finally. I'm right
outside your place, OK?

743
01:08:15,597 --> 01:08:18,332
You're outside my fuck...? This
guy's out of his fucking mind, OK?

744
01:08:18,365 --> 01:08:21,435
Go inside... Dude, chill the fuck
out... You understand me?

745
01:08:22,336 --> 01:08:23,705
It's fine.

746
01:08:24,204 --> 01:08:26,708
Listen, man, I'm about to pull
up, OK?

747
01:08:28,308 --> 01:08:30,578
Tell me you understand me.
Matteo?

748
01:08:30,612 --> 01:08:32,179
Matteo, I need you to answer me,
bro.

749
01:08:32,212 --> 01:08:33,347
Answer me.

01:08:34,348 --> 01:08:35,348
Yo!

RUN! Fucking run, OK!

Where you at?

762
01:11:13,975 --> 01:11:15,009
Hey, stay there.

763
01:11:15,042 --> 01:11:16,343

You know why! I don't know! You do!

01:13:20,167 --> 01:13:22,145
You know what you did to Tessa!
What did I do? Tessa. No! Tessa.

Admit what you fucking did!
You did! I loved her, I loved her!

783
01:13:29,844 --> 01:13:32,713
We were together. And she wanted
me to kill somebody but...

784
01:13:32,747 --> 01:13:34,749
You did it! We were together!

785
01:13:34,782 --> 01:13:38,719
I loved her but I had to leave her,
she wanted me to kill somebody.

786
01:13:38,753 --> 01:13:39,452

01:13:53,768 --> 01:13:54,168
(Choking)

796
01:13:54,201 --> 01:13:57,772
(Choking)

797
01:13:58,572 --> 01:13:59,572

across the street)

805
01:16:03,731 --> 01:16:04,765
Hi.

806
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,668
Thank you.

807
01:16:26,654 --> 01:16:29,323
Hey, man, you can't go inside,
alright? You got to stand in line.

808
01:16:29,356 --> 01:16:30,858
Nah, you can't go inside.

809
01:16:30,891 --> 01:16:32,960
Nah, man, you can't go inside.

810
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:37,098
Can't go inside looking like
that shit, man. Go clean up.

811
01:17:08,162 --> 01:17:09,842
Hey, man, I told you you can't
come inside.

812
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:41,028
Get out of my face!

813
01:18:03,384 --> 01:18:06,320
Tessa!

814
01:18:06,353 --> 01:18:09,123
Tessa!

815
01:18:39,554 --> 01:18:41,855

Tessa.

824
01:21:29,056 --> 01:21:31,492
Baby, baby, look at me.

825
01:22:23,243 --> 01:22:24,646
Baby.

826
01:22:29,584 --> 01:22:32,052
Baby, listen to me. No!

827
01:22:50,137 --> 01:22:51,706
Why?

828
01:22:54,776 --> 01:22:57,344
Why would you do this?

829
01:23:13,494 --> 01:23:16,664
Because now I know you truly
love me.

830
01:23:21,569 --> 01:23:23,003
What does that mean?

831
01:24:05,479 --> 01:24:08,448
