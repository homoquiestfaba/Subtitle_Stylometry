00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:33,748
Is that all right
with you?

182
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:34,785
Swell.

183
00:09:34,888 --> 00:09:36,685
Peachy.

184
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:39,752
Elise.

185
00:09:44,964 --> 00:09:46,124
Thankyou.

186
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:50,935
Is that Elise
with an ''A'' or an '' E''?

187
00:09:51,037 --> 00:09:52,834
Nice meeting you, too,

188
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:55,373
Assistant Special Agent
in Charge Hubbard.

189
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:56,874
Anthony.

190
00:09:59,112 --> 00:10:01,080
Pin a tail on her.

191
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,169
I'm on it.

192
00:10:17,664 --> 00:10:19,131
You sleep here?

193
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:22,430
Immigration called.

194
00:10:22,535 --> 00:10:25,129
Underneath the false bottom,
we found this.

195
00:10:25,238 --> 00:10:28,207
All in small bills,
so we figured smurf, right?

196
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:30,401
And considering yesterday's
terrorist alert,

197
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,172
and where he's been recently,
we'd better call Frank.

198
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,144
Who's trying to score points
with his boss big-time.

199
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:37,011
Has he broken
any laws?

200
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:41,883
No, sir. He is $20 under
the $1 0,000 limit.

201
00:10:41,988 --> 00:10:42,977
Not anymore.

202
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:45,216
So, Khalil,

203
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:47,451
you're saying this
is an inheritance?

204
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:50,460
Somebody died, and you're
bringing them the money.

205
00:10:50,563 --> 00:10:53,031
No, no. Doory.

206
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:54,997
He means dowry.

207
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:57,899
Check out his neck.

208
00:10:58,004 --> 00:11:00,336
1 0,000 for a wedding?

209
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,873
Frank: The tobacc--

210
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:03,272
[Puffs]

211
00:11:03,376 --> 00:11:04,638
[Hisses]

212
00:11:04,744 --> 00:11:06,302
Territories.

213
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:10,140
Put him in play.

214
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:14,252
Hub: He's heading north
onto Bell Parkway.

215
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:16,788
Back home
the security services

216
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:18,447
would be up this guy's ass
with a poker.

217
00:11:18,591 --> 00:11:19,785
What do we do?
We let him go.

218
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:20,915
Stay back
a little bit, Frank.

219
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,288
It's not
my first date, Hub.

220
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:24,996
He's taking the BQE.

221
00:11:25,131 --> 00:11:26,063
Looks like it's Brooklyn.

222
00:11:26,165 --> 00:11:27,860
Probably Brooklyn.

223
00:11:57,196 --> 00:11:58,686
He's all yours, Ray.

224
00:12:12,645 --> 00:12:14,909
Ray, go a little softer
on him, okay?

225
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:16,140
Pass him offto Patsy.

226
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:17,614
Patsy, watch out
for reflections.

227
00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:24,979
Hub: Okay, you got him.

228
00:12:29,595 --> 00:12:31,654
Ah, here.
Got thejudge.

229
00:12:31,798 --> 00:12:33,663
Morning,judge.
How areyou?

230
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:36,064
Yeah. How are things
down at Second Circuit?

231
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:37,329
Yeah, right.
I know whatyou mean.

232
00:12:37,437 --> 00:12:38,495
Listen,
we got a situation here.

233
00:12:38,604 --> 00:12:40,003
Who's he talking to?
Hold on one second,Judge.

234
00:12:40,106 --> 00:12:41,130
Who is he talking to?

235
00:12:43,643 --> 00:12:45,804
We getting film on this?
Who's he talking to?

236
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:46,970
Don't know him.

237
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,138
Ifwe were allowed
to get sound

238
00:12:48,247 --> 00:12:50,078
on them, we'd know.

239
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:53,412
Hub: Yeah, yeah,Judge.

240
00:12:56,055 --> 00:12:57,147
No, sir.

241
00:12:58,357 --> 00:12:59,324
No, sir, notyet.

242
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,319
No, notyet, sir, but--

243
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:05,522
We got reason to--

244
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:11,164
Damn it, Mike.
Mike, back off.

245
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:15,238
Frank: Oh, shit.
He's making him.

246
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:16,501
Shit! Fuck!

247
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:17,906
Hub: All units go!

248
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,005
Look, I got to get
back toyou,Judge.

249
00:13:23,116 --> 00:13:24,515
Shit!

250
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:27,886
[Horn Honks]

251
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:37,395
Hub: Go around.
Go around, Frank.

252
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:40,192
I got him, I got him.

253
00:13:58,284 --> 00:13:59,683
Frank: There he is.

254
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:02,913
We got him.
Stiverson and Throop.

255
00:14:03,022 --> 00:14:04,080
Cut him off!.

256
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,228
There he is.

257
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:28,605
Hey, come back, Khalil!

258
00:14:28,714 --> 00:14:29,874
Khalil!

259
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:39,080
All units, we got a red van

260
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:41,716
going east on Stiverson
offofVernon. Red van.

261
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:44,227
Did you get plates
on that, Frank?

262
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:45,764
Plates? No.

263
00:14:45,898 --> 00:14:48,731
Butyou got to love
that move.

264
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:50,131
No plates.

265
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:51,203
Theyjust found the van.

266
00:14:51,304 --> 00:14:52,931
Doesn't look like
they'll find any prints.

267
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:53,937
Hub: Vehicle I.D.?

268
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,938
Reported stolen
plates are bogus, too.

269
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:55,939
What about hair, fiber?

270
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:57,634
Already on its way
to the lab.

271
00:14:57,743 --> 00:14:59,574
Hub, we're checking
this guy out

272
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:01,374
in the red book
right now.

273
00:15:03,115 --> 00:15:04,946
Goodjob, Mike.

274
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:07,212
It's Floyd Rose.

275
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,480
Go, Floyd.

276
00:15:08,588 --> 00:15:10,146
Floyd: You're not
gonna believe this.

277
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:12,417
Guess who
just showed up.

278
00:15:17,863 --> 00:15:19,626
How's she living, Floyd?

279
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:22,701
She's got 2 in a Plymouth,
at least 3 inside,

280
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:24,770
and see that guy
walking his dog?

281
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,770
He did his business
about an hour ago,

282
00:15:26,872 --> 00:15:28,305
and they're still walking.

283
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:29,897
I had a dog
like that once.

284
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:32,876
It's not his dog, wet wick.
They're spies.

285
00:15:32,979 --> 00:15:36,073
The dog works
for the CIA?

286
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:37,740
Hub over radio:
All units report.

287
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,839
This is unit one.

288
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:40,043
We're good to go.

289
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:41,949
Man on radio:
Unit 2, we're ready.

290
00:15:42,054 --> 00:15:43,351
All right, let's roll.

291
00:15:47,193 --> 00:15:49,593
Federal agents!
Against the fence!

292

Man: FBI!

00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:54,523
Putyour hands
behind your head.

294
00:16:01,207 --> 00:16:04,904
Hi, guys.
I expectyou know the drill.

295
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,911
Man: Hold it right there.

296
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:25,160
Hello.

297
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:26,959
Elise.

298
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:29,368
I never touched him.

299
00:16:29,468 --> 00:16:30,366
Really?

300
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:32,164
Well, we're gonna
have to take him

301
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:33,568
into custody anyway.
Mike, Frank.

302
00:16:33,673 --> 00:16:36,039
What areyou gonna charge
him with,jaywalking?

303
00:16:36,142 --> 00:16:38,542
I don't suppose I could have a
little chat with him here first?

304
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:41,204
I don't think so, Elise.
Not in this lifetime.

305
00:16:41,314 --> 00:16:45,114
You know, Hub--
May I call you Hub?

306
00:16:45,217 --> 00:16:46,707
Yes, you may.

307
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:48,878
Ifyou guys hadn't blown
the surveillance,

308
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:50,285
we'd have been able
to follow the money.

309
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:52,186
What doyou say, Khalil?

310
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:53,849
You would have led us right
toyour friends, wouldn'tyou?

311
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:55,984
What friends?

312
00:16:57,229 --> 00:16:58,787
Take him out.

313
00:17:02,168 --> 00:17:03,066
What friends, Elise?

314
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:06,137
What haveyou got
for me, huh?

315
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:11,072
Come on. Share something
with me, Elise.

316
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:12,542
Enlighten me.

317
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:15,273
You can tell me now,
oryou can tell me downtown.

318
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:17,315
You know, one phone call,
and he's mine.

319
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,383
You know the number.

320
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:21,553
I have about, uh--

321
00:17:21,654 --> 00:17:23,121
You have the right
to remain silent.

322
00:17:23,222 --> 00:17:24,382
You have the right
to an attorney.

323
00:17:24,523 --> 00:17:25,421
That's whatyou also have.

324
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:26,991
Oh, come on.

325
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:28,492
Hey, doyou have
any idea

326
00:17:28,594 --> 00:17:29,822
whatyou're
starting here?

327
00:17:29,962 --> 00:17:31,224
What kind ofshit storm
this could turn into?

328
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,594
Kidnapping,
obstruction ofjustice,

329
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:34,757

330
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:38,727
Get her out ofhere.

331

I love whatyou've done
with the place.

334
00:17:48,514 --> 00:17:50,812
you don't get carsick
or anything?

335
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,008

too tight?

Wow.
You're really good.

She's really good.

340
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:02,450
So what's going on
here, Elise?

00:18:02,595 --> 00:18:03,994

of Beirut.

343
00:18:06,699 --> 00:18:08,530
I was there
from '79 to '82.

344
00:18:08,634 --> 00:18:09,658
No shit.

345
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:11,327
Yeah. My father taught
economics. Henry Kraft.

346
00:18:11,437 --> 00:18:14,201
Is there a terrorist cell
operating in the city

347
00:18:14,306 --> 00:18:15,204
that we're unaware of?

348
00:18:15,307 --> 00:18:17,172
It's such a tragedy.

349
00:18:17,276 --> 00:18:19,540
Growing up there
was like paradise.

350
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:20,942
Like an exotic Paris.

351
00:18:21,046 --> 00:18:22,274
Right, Frank?

352
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:24,178
Yeah, it's real exotic

on Rikers Island, too.

354
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:27,750
You know what they do
to women in there?

355
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:32,015
Mmm, yum.

356
00:18:32,158 --> 00:18:34,217

Go.

362
00:18:50,443 --> 00:18:52,707
3 men, definitely armed,

363
00:18:52,812 --> 00:18:54,541
and this time
they're still on the bus.

364
00:18:54,647 --> 00:18:56,205
So no communication
ofany kind?

365
00:18:56,315 --> 00:18:57,304
No, no, it's weird.

366
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,713
They'rejust in there.

367
00:18:58,818 --> 00:19:00,149
Just in there. Okay.

368
00:19:00,252 --> 00:19:02,743
See ifyou can get the frequency
ofthe bus driver's radio.

369
00:19:02,855 --> 00:19:03,753
We'll try and get him
on the phone.

371
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:05,754

00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:07,222
Get a couple
ofdat phones, okay?

373
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,485
Make sure they're
secure portables.

374
00:19:08,627 --> 00:19:10,652
Perfect.
The negotiator's on his way.

375
00:19:10,796 --> 00:19:11,956
A couple oftechies,
too, Frank.

376
00:19:12,064 --> 00:19:13,088
We want sound.

377
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:18,597
Sir.

378
00:19:18,704 --> 00:19:19,966
There's children
on that bus.

379
00:19:20,072 --> 00:19:21,505
We counted about 6.

380
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:25,441
That gives us something
to workwith, then, doesn't it?

381
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:31,243
Elise: What's happening
out there?

382
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,750
Take her outside
the perimeter, will you?

383
00:19:36,255 --> 00:19:38,815
They've taken another bus,
haven't they?

384
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:39,856
Hey, talk to me.

385
00:19:39,992 --> 00:19:40,981
You want to talk now.

386
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:42,024
You want me to beyour
friend now. Is that it?

387
00:19:42,127 --> 00:19:43,890
Listen. These guys
are the real deal.

388
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:45,190
Are they?
How doyou know?

389
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:47,663
Is there a terrorist cell
operating in Brooklyn?

390
00:19:49,368 --> 00:19:50,266
Yes.

391
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:51,927
The blue bus,
was that a warning?

392
00:19:52,037 --> 00:19:54,062
Yes, and I'm afraid
they're gonna blow this one.

393
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:55,435
How doyou know they're
gonna blow the bus

394
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,769
ifthey haven't
blown it already?

395
00:19:56,876 --> 00:19:59,811
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

396
00:19:59,912 --> 00:20:01,641
They haven't asked
for anything, have they?

397
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:07,151
Frank: The driver's name
is Larry Kaiser.

398
00:20:07,253 --> 00:20:08,481
He says they've got
explosives

399
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:09,611
strapped
to their chests,

400
00:20:09,722 --> 00:20:11,053
they've got
automatic weapons,

401
00:20:11,156 --> 00:20:12,851
and he thinks they're
speaking Arabic.

402
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:13,856
Where the hell
is the negotiator?

403
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:15,654
The tunnels
got 20-minute delays.

404
00:20:15,794 --> 00:20:17,022
They're working
on both bridges.

405
00:20:17,162 --> 00:20:18,959
Okay, did he say anything else
about the device?

406
00:20:19,064 --> 00:20:20,224
Did he describe it an anyway?

407
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:22,493
Did he talk about cords
or buttons or anything?

408
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:24,501
No. He didn't say.

409
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:37,979
Oh.

410
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,414
Oh, God.

411
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,620
They're not here
to negotiate.

412
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:44,916
Meaning?

413
00:20:45,057 --> 00:20:47,184
Theywere waiting
for the cameras.

414
00:20:47,326 --> 00:20:48,793
Theywant everybody
watching.

415
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:52,526
You've got
the shooters in place?

416
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:53,962
Yeah. So?

417
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:55,658
Use them.

418
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:56,792
Kill them now.

419
00:20:56,902 --> 00:21:00,702
Look, it's lose-lose
anywayyou play it.

420
00:21:00,806 --> 00:21:03,104
You want to lose
little or lose big?

421
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,301
I got the marksmen
on the com.

422
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:06,378
They're waiting
for a clean shot.

423
00:21:17,756 --> 00:21:20,190

434
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:48,847
I don't have the authority
to negotiate any deals

these children.

I appreciateyour gesture.

455
00:22:59,058 --> 00:23:00,548
The best way
to get whatyou want

456
00:23:00,693 --> 00:23:03,287
in this situation is to show
yourselfto be reasonable,

457
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:04,828
which you have done.

458
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,727

Now we got some more
to talk about.

462
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:22,005
As you can see,
I'm unarmed.

463
00:23:22,114 --> 00:23:24,275
I have no weapons.

464
00:23:25,784 --> 00:23:28,878
And what I propose...

465
00:23:28,987 --> 00:23:31,820
is thatyou let
these people go...

466
00:23:31,957 --> 00:23:33,424
and I'll take their place.

467
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:37,290
This wayyou don't have to worry
about pizza deliveries

468
00:23:37,396 --> 00:23:39,864
or people running back
and forth to the bathroom

469

00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,412
you'll see the helicopters
are already moving out.

476
00:24:09,495 --> 00:24:10,985
I'm gonna takeyour silence

477
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,155

considering my offer.

478
00:24:19,304 --> 00:24:20,328
I'll tell you what.

to take responsibility
for the blast.

All right?

741

Uh, sometimes, in addition
to being a nationality,

742
00:38:39,897 --> 00:38:41,831
being a Palestinian
is a profession,

743
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:43,161
a very lucrative one.

744

No. He can't know
we're talking.

You know, some peoplejust
cannot live in the camps.

For my brother,
it was already like dying.

The only thing
he lives for is movies.

805

and tell him that...

because we don't have him.

that conventional
law enforcement

for riot control, Senator,

General.

1242
01:02:11,508 --> 01:02:14,272
The army's a broadsword,
not a scalpel.

1243
01:02:14,377 --> 01:02:15,435
Trust me, Senator,

1244
01:02:15,545 --> 01:02:17,672
you do not want the army
in an American city.

1245
01:02:17,781 --> 01:02:18,679
But hypothetically,

1246
01:02:18,782 --> 01:02:20,807
how long would it
takeyou to deploy?

1247
01:02:20,917 --> 01:02:22,145
You know we can't go in

1248
01:02:22,252 --> 01:02:24,482
until the president invokes
the War Powers Act.

1249
01:02:24,587 --> 01:02:25,576
I understand that,
General.

1250
01:02:25,688 --> 01:02:27,280
Let's assume
for a moment

1251
01:02:27,424 --> 01:02:28,891
that the order
has been given.

1252
01:02:28,992 --> 01:02:31,893
1 2 hours after the president
gives the order,

1253
01:02:31,995 --> 01:02:34,589
we can be on the ground.

1254
01:02:34,731 --> 01:02:37,825
One light infantry division
of 1 0,700 men.

1255
01:02:37,934 --> 01:02:40,164
Elements ofthe rapid
deployment force,

1256
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:42,534
special forces, delta,

1257
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:45,472
A.P.C.S, helicopters,
tanks,

1258
01:02:45,575 --> 01:02:50,069
and, ofcourse, the ubiquitous
M-1 6 A-1 assault rifle.

1259
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:52,512
A humble enough weapon until
you see it in the hands ofa man

1260
01:02:52,615 --> 01:02:54,879
outsideyour local
bowling alley or 7-1 1 .

1261
01:02:54,984 --> 01:02:58,420
It will be noisy,
it will be scary,

1262
01:02:58,521 --> 01:03:01,115
and it will not be mistaken
for a VFW parade.

1263
01:03:01,257 --> 01:03:02,781
I remind you,
General Devereaux

1264
01:03:02,926 --> 01:03:05,326
does not speak for
official army policy.

1265
01:03:05,428 --> 01:03:07,055
A police function
has become accepted

1266
01:03:07,197 --> 01:03:09,825
as our role in Haiti
and Somalia.

1267
01:03:12,001 --> 01:03:13,969
Make no mistake.

1268
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:15,970
We will hunt down
the enemy,

1269
01:03:16,072 --> 01:03:17,596
we will find the enemy,

1270
01:03:17,707 --> 01:03:18,867
and we will
kill the enemy.

1271
01:03:18,975 --> 01:03:21,842
And no card-carrying member
ofthe ACLU

1272
01:03:21,945 --> 01:03:25,073
is more dead set against it
than I am,

1273
01:03:25,181 --> 01:03:27,081
which is why I urgeyou...

1274
01:03:28,852 --> 01:03:31,252
I imploreyou...

1275
01:03:31,354 --> 01:03:33,185
do not consider this
as an option.

1276
01:03:34,924 --> 01:03:38,519
I knowjust what
the president's going to say.

1277
01:03:38,661 --> 01:03:41,687
That's exactlywhyyou're
the only man for thejob.

1278
01:03:41,831 --> 01:03:43,958
I'd like to introduce
Anthony Hubbard.

1279
01:03:44,067 --> 01:03:46,467
He's myASAIC on the ground
up in Brooklyn.

1280
01:03:46,569 --> 01:03:50,300
His team was able to take out
the first cell within 36 hours

1281
01:03:50,406 --> 01:03:52,067
ofthe attack on the 87 bus.

1282
01:03:52,175 --> 01:03:54,006
He's also the man
who took out the terrorist

1283
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:55,475
in that schoolhouse.

1284
01:03:55,578 --> 01:03:56,602
Hub.

1285
01:03:57,914 --> 01:04:01,372
Thejob ofthe FBI is to...

1286
01:04:01,484 --> 01:04:02,781
to respond.

1287
01:04:02,886 --> 01:04:05,616
Thejob ofthe army--
to defend.

1288
01:04:05,722 --> 01:04:07,519
With the presence
ofthe army,

1289
01:04:07,657 --> 01:04:10,751
our ability to investigate
will be seriously inhibited.

1290
01:04:10,894 --> 01:04:13,556
It will push these criminals
further underground.

1291
01:04:13,696 --> 01:04:15,254
Most importantly,
you can't fight a war

1292
01:04:15,398 --> 01:04:16,888
against an enemy
you can't see.

1293
01:04:18,368 --> 01:04:21,132
I think ifwe exercise
patience, restraint,

1294
01:04:21,237 --> 01:04:24,172
allow our men and women
up in New York

1295
01:04:24,274 --> 01:04:25,673
to do theirjob...

1296
01:04:25,775 --> 01:04:28,835
I thinkwe'll be effective.

1297
01:04:31,314 --> 01:04:32,474
Thankyou,
Agent Hubbard.

1298
01:04:32,582 --> 01:04:34,516
I, too, think that we should
proceed with caution.

1299
01:04:34,617 --> 01:04:36,585
Some ofyou may not know
Sharon Bridger.

1300
01:04:36,686 --> 01:04:38,119
Sharon was posted
in Iraq

1301
01:04:38,221 --> 01:04:39,916
as part of
our covert operations

1302
01:04:40,023 --> 01:04:41,650
during the GulfWar.

1303
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:43,520
Sharon.

1304
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:44,820
Sir, ifI may.

1305
01:04:44,961 --> 01:04:46,189
Thankyou.

1306
01:05:00,076 --> 01:05:01,304
I'm sure everyone here

1307
01:05:01,411 --> 01:05:04,539
knows the traditional model
ofthe terrorist network.

1308
01:05:04,647 --> 01:05:07,343
One cell controls
all others.

1309
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:08,883
Cut offthe head,
the bodywill wither.

1310
01:05:08,985 --> 01:05:12,148
Unfortunately, the old wisdom
no longer applies.

1311
01:05:12,255 --> 01:05:14,951
The new paradigm
is each cell

1312
01:05:15,091 --> 01:05:17,059
operates independent
ofthe other.

1313
01:05:17,193 --> 01:05:20,685
Cut offone head,
another rises up in its place.

1314
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:23,822
Bus 87 was the work
ofthe first cell

1315
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:26,834
whose remaining elements,
we believe,

1316
01:05:26,936 --> 01:05:28,426
the FBI took down.

1317
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,104
This then activated
the work ofcell 2.

1318
01:05:34,811 --> 01:05:35,778
The theater gala.

1319
01:05:35,878 --> 01:05:37,846
At the most,
we believe, there are 3,

1320
01:05:37,947 --> 01:05:39,209
possibly 4 cells.

1321
01:05:39,382 --> 01:05:40,906
Well, then how much longer

1322
01:05:41,017 --> 01:05:43,986
before we can take out
the last cell?

1323
01:05:49,292 --> 01:05:50,259
We don't know.

1324
01:05:56,833 --> 01:05:59,597
Male reporter: This is a tragedy
ofstaggering proportion.

1325
01:05:59,702 --> 01:06:01,761
One Federal Plaza
was the headquarters

1326
01:06:01,871 --> 01:06:04,567
ofthe FBI counterterrorism
task force,

1327
01:06:04,674 --> 01:06:06,471
as well as many other
federal agents...

1328
01:06:06,576 --> 01:06:07,736
Female reporter:
Authorities are withholding

1329
01:06:07,844 --> 01:06:09,607
the names ofthose who died.

1330
01:06:09,712 --> 01:06:11,373
Male reporter: The worst
in New York City's history.

1331
01:06:11,481 --> 01:06:12,539
The most devastating...

1332
01:06:12,649 --> 01:06:13,741
Second newsman:
Letters ofcondolence

1333
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:16,182
have been received from
leaders around the world.

1334
01:06:16,286 --> 01:06:18,277
Boris Yeltsin forwarded
a message...

1335
01:06:28,097 --> 01:06:30,998
Body count's
a little over 200 so far.

1336
01:06:33,736 --> 01:06:35,169
What about our people?

1337
01:06:35,271 --> 01:06:37,296
Mike, Tina.

1338
01:06:37,407 --> 01:06:39,602
Theywere all
in there working.

1339
01:06:39,709 --> 01:06:40,971
Hub.

1340
01:06:43,212 --> 01:06:44,179
Hub.

1341
01:06:45,615 --> 01:06:47,845
This is Colonel Hardwick,
army intelligence.

1342
01:06:49,952 --> 01:06:50,850
Colonel.

1343
01:06:52,255 --> 01:06:55,088
I'm here as an advisor only.

1344
01:06:55,224 --> 01:06:56,851
I intend to keep
a low profile.

1345
01:06:56,993 --> 01:06:59,120
Appreciateyour concern.

1346
01:07:01,864 --> 01:07:03,798
I don't mean
to be insensitive,

1347
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:07,267
but, uh,just what exactly are
your capabilities at this point?

1348
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:10,533
Your infrastructure?

1349
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,267
You're standing on
our infrastructure.

1350
01:07:16,779 --> 01:07:18,440
Excuse me.

1351
01:07:26,723 --> 01:07:28,054
Hey, Hub,

1352
01:07:28,191 --> 01:07:29,158
they managed to get
a partial VI N number

1353
01:07:29,292 --> 01:07:30,657
offthe van.

1354
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,284
DMV says it was reported
stolen the day before...

1355
01:07:32,428 --> 01:07:34,055
in Brooklyn?

1356
01:07:34,197 --> 01:07:35,255
You got it.

1357
01:07:35,398 --> 01:07:38,390
Hub, the final body count
just came in.

1358
01:07:39,969 --> 01:07:41,368
600 dead.

1359
01:07:44,841 --> 01:07:46,741
[Doorbell Buzzes]

1360
01:07:48,511 --> 01:07:50,411
[Doorbell Buzzes]

1361
01:07:57,787 --> 01:08:00,187
I'm very sorry
aboutyour friends.

1362
01:08:05,161 --> 01:08:07,220
Frank, it's, uh...

1363
01:08:07,363 --> 01:08:08,421
Sharon.

1364
01:08:08,564 --> 01:08:10,054
I didn't catch
your last name, Sharon.

1365
01:08:10,199 --> 01:08:11,996
Bridger.

1366
01:08:12,101 --> 01:08:12,999
Howyou doing, Frank?

1367
01:08:13,102 --> 01:08:14,069
Been better.

1368
01:08:15,171 --> 01:08:16,160
[Sighs]

1369
01:08:16,272 --> 01:08:17,864
Well...

1370
01:08:17,974 --> 01:08:20,033
the agency came up with
another list ofprobables.

1371
01:08:20,143 --> 01:08:22,771
I thinkwe should
circulate them.

1372
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:25,506
Hey...

1373
01:08:25,615 --> 01:08:27,378
this stuffmight be good.

1374
01:08:27,483 --> 01:08:29,007
Whywas there
no warning from Samir?

1375
01:08:30,186 --> 01:08:31,118
Because he didn't
know anything.

1376
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:32,619
Says Samir.

1377
01:08:32,722 --> 01:08:34,280
Says me.

1378
01:08:34,424 --> 01:08:35,914
Maybe I'll ask him.

1379
01:08:36,058 --> 01:08:37,992
Yeah, over my dead body.

1380
01:08:38,127 --> 01:08:40,027
Over 600 dead bodies.

1381
01:08:40,129 --> 01:08:41,596
Look, he's one
ofthe good guys, okay?

1382
01:08:41,697 --> 01:08:42,595
How can you be so sure?

1383
01:08:42,698 --> 01:08:44,222
Because he was part
ofthe operation

1384
01:08:44,367 --> 01:08:47,393
to destabilize
Saddam Hussein with me, okay?

1385
01:08:47,503 --> 01:08:48,765
Samir is a go-between.

1386
01:08:48,871 --> 01:08:50,429
He risked his life
for us over there.

1387
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:51,939
Go-between who, Sharon?

1388
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:54,509
Look, come on,
I need names, okay?

1389
01:08:54,610 --> 01:08:57,135
I need--I need photographs
or something, okay?

1390
01:08:57,246 --> 01:08:58,144
I don't need
a history lesson.

1391
01:08:58,247 --> 01:08:59,236
I can't giveyou pictures

1392
01:08:59,348 --> 01:09:00,337
because I don't know
what they look like.

1393
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:01,439
We did everything
at arm's length.

1394
01:09:01,551 --> 01:09:02,449
Soyou got nothing?

1395
01:09:02,552 --> 01:09:03,576
I've got Samir.

1396
01:09:03,686 --> 01:09:05,586
Well, does Samir have
any contact with them?

1397
01:09:05,688 --> 01:09:06,655
Minimal.

1398
01:09:06,756 --> 01:09:08,815
So how does he do it?

1399
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:10,425
He can't.
They initiate.

1400
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,788
And otherwise?

1401
01:09:11,928 --> 01:09:13,020
He's waiting.

1402
01:09:13,162 --> 01:09:14,891
He's--He's waiting?

1403
01:09:14,997 --> 01:09:15,895
What the hell
is he waiting for?

1404
01:09:15,998 --> 01:09:17,363
More bodies?
More buildings?

1405
01:09:17,467 --> 01:09:19,094
We got a lot ofbuildings
out there.

1406
01:09:19,202 --> 01:09:20,430
Maybe he's waiting to blow up
a few more ofthem.

1407
01:09:20,536 --> 01:09:21,969
Hey, look, I know
howyou must feel.

1408
01:09:22,071 --> 01:09:23,766
Hey, look, you don't
know how I feel.

1409
01:09:23,873 --> 01:09:25,636
I lost friends
ofmine tonight.

1410
01:09:25,741 --> 01:09:26,901
You don't know how I feel!

1411
01:09:29,278 --> 01:09:30,336
They'll make
contact soon.

1412
01:09:30,446 --> 01:09:32,380
When? That's what I want
to know--when?

1413
01:09:32,482 --> 01:09:33,949
Why soon?
Why not now?

1414
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:36,211
What is the trade craft?
What are the visuals?

1415
