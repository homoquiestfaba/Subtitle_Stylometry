1
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:33,616
You shoud be practicing.

2
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,391
I am practicing

3
00:15:36,113 --> 00:15:37,717
What you're doing, you won't be needing these.

4
00:15:37,807 --> 00:15:39,293
What's your problem?

5
00:30:06,073 --> 00:30:07,407
What do we learn here?

6
00:30:07,568 --> 00:30:11,113
No weakness! No pain! No mercy!

7
00:30:12,381 --> 00:30:14,004
Begin!

8
00:38:44,887 --> 00:38:46,138
He's had enough.

9
00:38:46,863 --> 00:38:48,110
Don't you remember what we learned?

10
00:38:48,299 --> 00:38:49,111
No weakness. No pain.

11
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:53,737
No mercy!

12
00:39:05,355 --> 00:39:06,667
Go home.

13
00:45:08,411 --> 00:45:09,366
What are you doing?

14
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,990
Why did you stop?

15
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:14,097
Finish!

16
00:45:25,737 --> 00:45:28,686
We do not stop when our enemy is down!

17
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:29,944
No mercy. 

18
00:45:31,012 --> 00:45:32,006
No mercy in the studio.

19
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:35,195
No mercy in life.

20
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,653
What are you looking at?

21
00:45:43,387 --> 00:45:45,513
He's the one that attacked me.

22
00:45:59,677 --> 00:46:01,391
We are here to make peace.

23
00:46:03,316 --> 00:46:06,320
Let your little thing mind himself.

24
00:46:08,321 --> 00:46:09,493
One to one, no problem . . .

25
00:46:10,054 --> 00:46:12,989
. . . six to one, . . .
too much to ask of anyone.

26
00:46:14,352 --> 00:46:15,451
I see.

27
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,397
Prepare for match!

28
00:46:27,176 --> 00:46:29,337
We are not here to fight.

29
00:46:34,102 --> 00:46:37,981
You attack my students 
and disrespect my studio?!

30
00:46:38,331 --> 00:46:40,652
You want to leave?
Not so easy.

31
00:46:42,859 --> 00:46:44,078
Master Li, . . .

32
00:46:48,457 --> 00:46:50,141
You both came here.

33
00:46:51,966 --> 00:46:55,735
One of you fights now.

34
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,382
The boy will fight there.

35
00:47:06,689 --> 00:47:09,516

37
00:47:21,044 --> 00:47:26,570
Please instruct your students
to leave my boy alone to train.

38
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:29,122
Attention!

39
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:35,075
From now on the little thing
is to be left alone . . .

40
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:36,981
. . . until the tournament.

41
00:47:37,635 --> 00:47:38,744
Understood!

42
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:49,066
If he does not show up for the competition . . .

43
00:47:50,002 --> 00:47:52,789
. . . I will bring pain to him and you.

44
01:42:31,638 --> 01:42:32,833
Sir, . . .

45
01:42:34,089 --> 01:42:35,668
My name is Dre Parker.

46
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:43,224
My actions have brought 
dishonor to your family.

47
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:48,647
Your daughter has been 
a great friend to me.

48
01:42:49,821 --> 01:42:51,612
And from her I have learned . . .

49
01:42:52,992 --> 01:42:54,846
. .. that a true friend . . .

50
01:42:55,377 --> 01:42:58,233
. . . is a person who 
makes your life better.

51
01:42:58,693 --> 01:43:03,005
But, if you give me a second chance . . .

52
01:43:04,182 --> 01:43:07,770
. . . I promise that I will be . . .

53
01:43:08,947 --> 01:43:14,125
. . . the best friend your 
daughter has ever had.

54
01:44:29,148 --> 01:44:32,290
Let the tournament begin!

55
01:49:38,726 --> 01:49:43,250

You're disqualified!

62
01:53:54,546 --> 01:53:56,030
He's done.

63
01:53:57,148 --> 01:53:59,128

Dre Parker has 2 minutes 
to return to the match.

66
01:54:28,323 --> 01:54:31,040
If he is unable to return . . .

67
01:54:31,968 --> 01:54:35,033
. . . the Fighting Dragons win by default.

68
01:56:33,376 --> 01:56:37,321
Since Dre Parker has 
not returned to the ring . . .

69
01:56:58,233 --> 01:57:01,199
