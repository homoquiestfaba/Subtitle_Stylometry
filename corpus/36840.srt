1
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:44,948
An unidentified radio source
from deep space...

2
00:00:45,196 --> 00:00:47,152
...can neither be confirmed nor denied.

3
00:00:47,516 --> 00:00:49,154
Whatever it is, it ain't local.

4
00:00:49,396 --> 00:00:50,385
Position?

5
00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:52,228
Only 26 light years away.

6
00:00:52,476 --> 00:00:53,955
Sending this all over the world...

7
00:00:54,196 --> 00:00:55,948
...may be a national security breach.

8
00:00:56,436 --> 00:00:57,710
lt isn't a person-to-person call.

9
00:00:57,956 --> 00:01:00,026
lt's an announcement to get our
attention.

10
00:01:00,276 --> 00:01:01,789
The President's called a meeting.

11
00:01:02,036 --> 00:01:04,106
We must militarize this project.

12
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:07,029
There's no reason to believe
their intentions are hostile.

13
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:08,152
There's no proof of that.

14
00:01:08,396 --> 00:01:09,351
They don't speak English?

15
00:01:09,596 --> 00:01:12,508
We believe the message
contains instructions...

16
00:01:12,796 --> 00:01:15,310
...to build some kind of transport.

17
00:01:16,596 --> 00:01:18,507
You don't know what it does.

18
00:01:18,756 --> 00:01:20,428
No one says it's not dangerous.

19
00:01:20,676 --> 00:01:22,746
-They'll build it.
-Who gets to go?

20
00:01:23,036 --> 00:01:26,472
You're willing to risk your life
and die for this.

21
00:01:26,716 --> 00:01:28,149
Why?

22
00:02:37,246 --> 00:02:40,283
An unidentified radio source
from deep space...

23
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:42,756
...can neither be confirmed nor denied.

24
00:02:43,006 --> 00:02:44,644
Whatever it is, it ain't local.

25
00:02:44,886 --> 00:02:45,523
Position?

26
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,326
l checked interferometry.
ln Lyra, l think.

27
00:02:48,606 --> 00:02:49,755
-Vega?
-No!

28
00:02:50,006 --> 00:02:51,997
lt's only 26 light years away.

29
00:02:52,286 --> 00:02:53,844
l want all these people out of here.

30
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:55,314
Sending this all over the world...

31
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:57,238
...may be a national security breach.

32
00:02:57,686 --> 00:02:59,085
lt's not person-to-person.

33
00:02:59,326 --> 00:03:01,362
This may be an announcement
to get our attention.

34
00:03:01,646 --> 00:03:02,840
The President's called a meeting.

35
00:03:03,126 --> 00:03:05,640
Those frames we thought were noise?
This has structure.

36
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,116
l recommend we militarize this project.

37
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:11,119
No reason to believe
their intentions are hostile.

38
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:12,116
There's no proof.

39
00:03:12,446 --> 00:03:13,356
They don't speak English?

40
00:03:13,606 --> 00:03:15,722
Mathematics is the only
universal language.

41
00:03:16,086 --> 00:03:17,917
Buried within the message...

42
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,758
...is the key to decoding it.

43
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:22,521
Those look like blueprints.

44
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:25,519
We believe the message
contains instructions...

45
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,836
...for building some kind of machine.

46
00:03:28,886 --> 00:03:32,083
lt might turn out to be
some kind of a transport.

47
00:03:33,486 --> 00:03:35,636
You don't know what it does.
lt could be anything.

48
00:03:35,926 --> 00:03:37,996
-Nobody's saying this isn't dangerous.
-They're going to build it.

49
00:03:38,246 --> 00:03:39,042
Who goes?

50
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,799
-lt's complicated.
-Who?

51
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,997
You're willing to risk your life...

52
00:03:44,246 --> 00:03:45,565
...and die for this.

53
00:03:45,806 --> 00:03:47,285
Why?

54
00:05:08,277 --> 00:05:11,155
<i>It's obviously a major malfunction.</i>

55
00:05:26,677 --> 00:05:29,191
<i>...their President is a crook.</i>
<i>Well, I'm not a crook.</i>

56
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:36,312
<i>Robert Kennedy was shot</i>
<i>in that ballroom.</i>

57
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:40,912
<i>Thank God Almighty,</i>
<i>we are free at last!</i>

58
00:05:41,117 --> 00:05:43,790
<i>A sniper has fired</i>
<i>at President Kennedy.</i>

59
00:05:50,797 --> 00:05:54,631
<i>Or have you ever been</i>
<i>a member of the Communist party?</i>

60
00:05:58,637 --> 00:06:00,548
<i>Hi</i>-<i>yo, Silver!</i>

61
00:06:05,077 --> 00:06:06,635
<i>... 194 1...</i>

62
00:06:07,197 --> 00:06:10,234
<i>...a date which will live in infamy.</i>

63
00:06:14,157 --> 00:06:18,150
<i>We bring you the final edition of</i>
<i>our Maxwell House Good News of 1939.</i>

64
00:06:18,517 --> 00:06:21,748
<i>Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. North</i>
<i>America, and all the ships at sea.</i>

65
00:06:26,477 --> 00:06:30,470
<i>The only thing we have to fear</i>
<i>is fear itself.</i>

66
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:38,306
<i>CQ...</i>

67
00:07:38,717 --> 00:07:40,628
<i>...this is W</i>-<i>9 GFO.</i>

68
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,988
CQ, this is W-9 GFO here.
Come back?

69
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:50,952
CQ...

70
00:07:51,157 --> 00:07:53,671
...this is W-9 GFO here.

71
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:55,666
Come back?

72
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:03,430
CQ, this is W-9 GFO.
ls anybody out there?

73
00:08:04,397 --> 00:08:05,466
Not getting anything.

74
00:08:05,757 --> 00:08:07,190
Small moves, Ellie.

75
00:08:08,837 --> 00:08:09,906
Small moves.

76
00:08:12,437 --> 00:08:15,986
CQ, this is W-9 GFO here.
Come back?

77
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:18,509
<i>Copy, W</i>-<i>9 GFO.</i>

78
00:08:18,677 --> 00:08:20,474
<i>K</i>-<i>4 WLD here.</i>

79
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,270
What do l say?

80
00:08:22,437 --> 00:08:23,870
Just be yourself.

81
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:26,877
Where are you, K-4 WLD?
Come back?

82
00:08:27,117 --> 00:08:28,345
<i>Pensacola.</i>
<i>Over.</i>

83
00:08:28,597 --> 00:08:30,076
Pensacola, where's Pensacola?

84
00:08:30,437 --> 00:08:31,836
l'll give you a hint.

85
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:33,546
Orange juice.

86
00:08:36,277 --> 00:08:39,792
Copy that, K-4 WLD. How's the
weather down there in Florida?

87
00:08:40,957 --> 00:08:42,834
Pensacola, Florida.

88
00:08:43,517 --> 00:08:45,314
l have to tell you, Sparks.

89
00:08:46,077 --> 00:08:48,307
1,116 miles.

90
00:08:49,757 --> 00:08:50,872
Pretty good.

91
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,596
That's the farthest yet.

92
00:09:04,957 --> 00:09:06,709
Can we hear all the way to New York?

93
00:09:06,997 --> 00:09:08,112
Sure.

94
00:09:09,437 --> 00:09:11,348
Can we hear all the way
to California?

95
00:09:11,637 --> 00:09:13,275
l don't see why not.

96
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:15,868
Can we hear all the way to Alaska?

97
00:09:16,277 --> 00:09:17,505
On a really clear day.

98
00:09:17,717 --> 00:09:19,628
Can we hear all the way to China?

99
00:09:20,637 --> 00:09:23,026
On a really, really clear day.

100
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,867
Could we talk to the moon?

101
00:09:27,517 --> 00:09:30,190
lf it's a big enough radio,
l don't see why not.

102
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,748
Could we talk to Jupiter?

103
00:09:32,957 --> 00:09:35,346
Or what's the one after that?

104
00:09:35,797 --> 00:09:37,116
Don't tell me.

105
00:09:39,357 --> 00:09:40,676
l'll give you a hint.

106
00:09:41,117 --> 00:09:42,186
Hula-Hoops.

107
00:09:42,397 --> 00:09:44,308
Saturn!
Could we talk to Saturn?

108
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:52,146
Dad, could we talk to Mom?

109
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,669
l don't think even the biggest radio
could reach that far.

110
00:10:05,477 --> 00:10:07,229
All right, no more stalling.

111
00:10:11,997 --> 00:10:13,396
Pensacola!

112
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:22,111
That's a beauty.

113
00:10:23,517 --> 00:10:24,916
Now get some sleep.

114
00:10:32,957 --> 00:10:34,185
Hey, Dad?

115
00:10:35,197 --> 00:10:37,757
Do you think there's people
on other planets?

116
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:39,555
l don't know, Sparks.

117
00:10:40,957 --> 00:10:42,549
But l guess l'd say...

118
00:10:43,037 --> 00:10:44,789
...if it is just us...

119
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:48,467
...it seems like
an awful waste of space.

120
00:11:07,357 --> 00:11:09,587
CQ, this is W-9 GFO.

121
00:11:09,757 --> 00:11:12,317
Repeat. This is W-9 GFO.
Come back?

122
00:11:19,997 --> 00:11:21,908
l'm going to need a bigger antenna.

123
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:49,395
What do you think, Doc Arroway?

124
00:11:49,637 --> 00:11:51,036
lsn't she a beauty?

125
00:11:54,997 --> 00:11:56,066
lt'll do.

126
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:58,194
The village is five miles away.

127
00:11:58,557 --> 00:12:00,513
There's a general store
in the cantina.

128
00:12:00,677 --> 00:12:02,713
They can order anything
from San Juan.

129
00:12:02,877 --> 00:12:04,310
When can l get dish time?

130
00:12:04,477 --> 00:12:07,992
Dr. Clark said you couldn't wait.
Your first shift is tonight.

131
00:13:01,757 --> 00:13:02,872
Go back.

132
00:13:04,757 --> 00:13:07,396
Try back a little bit.
You had something there.

133
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:09,592
There!

134
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:12,989
-Right there?
-You hear it? Right there, that's it.

135
00:13:13,277 --> 00:13:16,792
All right, 1221 .46.
That's well within the L-band.

136
00:13:17,117 --> 00:13:18,072
Check off-axis.

137
00:13:19,037 --> 00:13:20,072
On it.

138
00:13:21,957 --> 00:13:23,356
lt's not in the neighborhood.

139
00:13:31,837 --> 00:13:33,748
Here it is.
J-1741 ...

140
00:13:34,037 --> 00:13:35,629
... + 2748.

141
00:13:35,837 --> 00:13:38,874
Catalogued November 4, 1982.
Pulsar.

142
00:13:41,437 --> 00:13:44,429
Must've been the glitch
in the timing that threw me.

143
00:13:44,637 --> 00:13:46,229
Must've been a starquake.

144
00:13:47,517 --> 00:13:51,351
l think it's great that you listen.
Most don't do that anymore.

145
00:13:51,517 --> 00:13:54,190
lt's just an old habit.
lt makes it feel more real.

146
00:13:54,397 --> 00:13:55,273
Ellie.

147
00:13:55,517 --> 00:13:56,632
Kent Clark.

148
00:13:59,397 --> 00:14:00,910
They said you'd been...

149
00:14:01,117 --> 00:14:03,426
...up at Owen's Valley
working under Drumlin.

150
00:14:03,637 --> 00:14:04,956
How'd you like him?

151
00:14:08,037 --> 00:14:11,996
That much? About what l'd expect
after what he had to say about you.

152
00:14:12,317 --> 00:14:13,909
And what was that?

153
00:14:14,397 --> 00:14:15,830
That you are brilliant...

154
00:14:16,117 --> 00:14:17,266
...driven...

155
00:14:17,597 --> 00:14:19,030
...a major pain in the ass...

156
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,070
...and obsessed with a field
of study he considers tantamount...

157
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,636
...to professional suicide.

158
00:14:24,357 --> 00:14:25,312
Anything else?

159
00:14:25,477 --> 00:14:27,195
Those were the highlights.

160
00:14:27,637 --> 00:14:30,071
David, Dr. Vernon.
Dr. Arroway.

161
00:14:31,477 --> 00:14:35,516
Believe you've already met our tireless
research assistant, Mr. Fisher...

162
00:14:36,157 --> 00:14:38,387
...as well as his cologne.

163
00:14:38,997 --> 00:14:41,272
Brook's looking at the black hole
in M-87.

164
00:14:41,437 --> 00:14:45,112
Ellie's studying Markarian 541,
a major gamma ray source.

165
00:14:45,437 --> 00:14:49,874
Dr. Arroway will be spending her
precious telescope time listening for...

166
00:14:50,597 --> 00:14:52,474
...listening for...

167
00:14:52,677 --> 00:14:54,110
Little green men.

168
00:15:01,877 --> 00:15:03,105
One down...

169
00:15:03,677 --> 00:15:05,235
...a couple billion to go.

170
00:15:21,357 --> 00:15:23,109
Arecibo, right?

171
00:15:24,277 --> 00:15:25,392
Does it show?

172
00:15:27,437 --> 00:15:28,506
Cracker Jack?

173
00:15:28,757 --> 00:15:29,473
No, thanks.

174
00:15:29,717 --> 00:15:30,945
Mind if l sit down?

175
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:36,551
l hear the locals,
they call it "El Radar."

176
00:15:36,757 --> 00:15:39,271
Convinced it has some
dark military purpose.

177
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:40,996
l think we're harmless.

178
00:15:42,437 --> 00:15:43,506
Palmer Joss.

179
00:15:44,317 --> 00:15:46,672
-Ellie Arroway.
-Nice to meet you, Ellie.

180
00:15:47,877 --> 00:15:50,516
What are you studying up there?

181
00:15:52,277 --> 00:15:53,596
The usual.

182
00:15:53,757 --> 00:15:57,432
Nebulae, quasars, pulsars,
stuff like that.

183
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:59,190
What are you writing?

184
00:15:59,517 --> 00:16:01,553
The usual.
Nouns, adverbs...

185
00:16:01,797 --> 00:16:03,276
...adjective here and there.

186
00:16:04,957 --> 00:16:06,390
l work on a project, SETl.

187
00:16:07,197 --> 00:16:09,108
Search for
Extraterrestrial lntelligence?

188
00:16:11,197 --> 00:16:12,835
That is out there!

189
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:16,187
Are you a student or something?

190
00:16:16,677 --> 00:16:18,713
l'm a writer.
l'm writing a book.

191
00:16:19,197 --> 00:16:20,471
l'm here doing research...

192
00:16:20,637 --> 00:16:23,674
...about how technology affects
Third World cultures.

193
00:16:23,837 --> 00:16:26,397
l'm also looking for this guy,
David Drumlin.

194
00:16:26,677 --> 00:16:30,590
He's head of the National Science
Foundation. l want an interview.

195
00:16:31,837 --> 00:16:33,475
l take it you know him?

196
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:36,316
You could say that.

197
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:38,996
SETl.

198
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:40,789
That's fringe!

199
00:16:41,237 --> 00:16:45,469
l've crossed paths with him. Something
like that must really chap his ass.

200
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:49,306
Compass.

201
00:16:51,237 --> 00:16:52,465
That's for you.

202
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:58,516
You better keep this.

203
00:16:59,677 --> 00:17:01,269
Might save your life someday.

204
00:17:05,877 --> 00:17:07,390
Have dinner with me tonight?

205
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:13,434
l don't make a good
research subject. l'm not quotable.

206
00:17:13,717 --> 00:17:15,947
No quotes.
Scout's honor.

207
00:17:16,317 --> 00:17:17,591
Good meal, good company.

208
00:17:18,397 --> 00:17:19,671
l've got to go.

209
00:17:28,437 --> 00:17:30,189
Drumlin's coming in Tuesday.

210
00:17:38,717 --> 00:17:41,914
Now l remember
why l took that desk job.

211
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,308
Dr. Drumlin, how are you?

212
00:17:46,877 --> 00:17:48,310
Glad you could make it.

213
00:17:49,437 --> 00:17:52,270
lf l'd known it took 3 planes,
l might've reconsidered.

214
00:17:52,477 --> 00:17:53,751
How is that new office?

215
00:17:53,957 --> 00:17:58,473
Still settling in. They already want to
give half my budget to the Pentagon.

216
00:17:59,197 --> 00:18:01,427
Still waiting for E.T. to call?

217
00:18:03,357 --> 00:18:04,949
Good to see you too!

218
00:18:05,437 --> 00:18:06,392
Asshole!

219
00:18:06,677 --> 00:18:08,747
Looks like it's
going to be a long night.

220
00:18:08,997 --> 00:18:13,434
Science must be accountable to the
people paying for it, the taxpayers.

221
00:18:13,597 --> 00:18:16,794
We must stop wasting money
on pie-in-the-sky abstractions...

222
00:18:16,957 --> 00:18:19,676
...and spend it on practical,
measurable ways...

223
00:18:19,837 --> 00:18:22,431
...to improve the lives
of the people who are paying.

224
00:18:22,597 --> 00:18:25,634
Not unlike my L-band,
globular clusters work.

225
00:18:25,877 --> 00:18:28,710
You want to do away
with all pure research now?

226
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:32,148
What's wrong with science
being practical? Even profitable?

227
00:18:32,357 --> 00:18:34,393
Nothing, as long as your motive...

228
00:18:34,677 --> 00:18:38,386
...is the search for truth. Which is
what the pursuit of science is.

229
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:43,192
That's an interesting position
from a man...

230
00:18:43,397 --> 00:18:45,911
...on a crusade against
the evils of technology...

231
00:18:46,197 --> 00:18:47,312
...Father Joss.

232
00:18:47,957 --> 00:18:51,154
l'm not against technology, Doctor.
l'm against...

233
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:54,429
...the men who deify it
at the expense of human truth.

234
00:18:58,357 --> 00:19:01,588
Kent, l need to have
a word with you. Over here, please.

235
00:19:07,037 --> 00:19:10,029
You think that hurt my chances
with that interview?

236
00:19:10,637 --> 00:19:11,990
You're a priest?

237
00:19:13,837 --> 00:19:14,952
Not really.

238
00:19:15,677 --> 00:19:18,316
l got my Masters in Divinity...

239
00:19:18,797 --> 00:19:22,073
...then left the seminary to do
secular humanitarian work...

240
00:19:22,317 --> 00:19:24,626
...coordinating
Third World churches.

241
00:19:25,357 --> 00:19:27,348
l couldn't live
with the celibacy thing.

242
00:19:31,757 --> 00:19:33,748
You could call me
a man of the cloth...

243
00:19:34,957 --> 00:19:36,470
...without the cloth.

244
00:19:39,677 --> 00:19:41,235
You want to get out of here?

245
00:19:43,157 --> 00:19:47,787
You see that large W-shaped
constellation there? That's Cassiopeia.

246
00:19:48,157 --> 00:19:52,389
And Cassiopeia A gives off
a whole lot of radio signals.

247
00:19:52,757 --> 00:19:54,315
l listen to them a lot.

248
00:19:54,597 --> 00:19:56,792
lt's a remnant of a supernova.

249
00:19:57,717 --> 00:20:00,277
When did you know
you wanted to be an astronomer?

250
00:20:02,517 --> 00:20:04,667
When l was about eight years old...

251
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:06,549
...watching the sunset...

252
00:20:07,557 --> 00:20:09,593
...l asked Dad, "What's that bright
star over there?"

253
00:20:12,957 --> 00:20:15,915
<i>He said that it wasn't a star.</i>
<i>It was...</i>

254
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:20,066
<i>...a whole planet called Venus...</i>

255
00:20:23,517 --> 00:20:26,634
...which should be over there soon.

256
00:20:27,597 --> 00:20:29,872
He said,
"You know why they called it Venus?

257
00:20:30,317 --> 00:20:33,434
Because they thought
it was so beautiful and glowing.

258
00:20:33,677 --> 00:20:35,190
But they didn't know...

259
00:20:35,877 --> 00:20:38,345
...that it's filled with...

260
00:20:39,517 --> 00:20:42,793
...deadly gases
and sulfuric acid rain."

261
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:47,467
Wow, l thought,
"This is it! l'm hooked!"

262
00:20:49,597 --> 00:20:53,146
There are four hundred billion
stars out there...

263
00:20:53,357 --> 00:20:55,154
...just in our galaxy alone.

264
00:20:56,117 --> 00:20:59,587
lf only one out of a million
of those had planets...

265
00:20:59,997 --> 00:21:02,955
...if just one out of a million
of those had life...

266
00:21:03,157 --> 00:21:07,150
...and if just one out of a million
of those had intelligent life...

267
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:12,274
...there would be literally millions
of civilizations out there.

268
00:21:14,077 --> 00:21:15,590
lf there wasn't...

269
00:21:16,477 --> 00:21:18,547
...it'd be an awful waste of space.

270
00:21:24,237 --> 00:21:25,352
Amen.

271
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:37,751
So l was lying there,
just looking at the sky.

272
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:44,395
And then l felt something.
l don't know.

273
00:21:45,677 --> 00:21:48,237
All l know is that l wasn't alone.

274
00:21:48,597 --> 00:21:52,670
For the first time in my life
l wasn't scared of nothing...

275
00:21:53,557 --> 00:21:55,070
...not even dying.

276
00:22:00,477 --> 00:22:02,274
lt was God.

277
00:22:04,797 --> 00:22:06,708
And there's no chance that...

278
00:22:07,197 --> 00:22:11,270
...you had this experience because
some part of you needed to have it?

279
00:22:12,477 --> 00:22:15,833
l'm a reasonably intelligent guy,
but this...

280
00:22:18,597 --> 00:22:22,067
My intellect
couldn't even touch this.

281
00:22:22,557 --> 00:22:23,512
No.

282
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:28,385
l've been to Sunday school
a few times.

283
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:31,387
And?

284
00:22:31,597 --> 00:22:35,954
l kept asking all these
really annoying questions like...

285
00:22:36,837 --> 00:22:39,192
..."Where did Mrs. Cain come from?"

286
00:22:41,037 --> 00:22:43,232
And pretty soon they asked my dad...

287
00:22:43,477 --> 00:22:46,071
...if he wouldn't mind
keeping me home from now on.

288
00:22:46,357 --> 00:22:47,585
Your dad...

289
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:50,716
ls it this guy?

290
00:22:50,877 --> 00:22:52,026
Yeah.

291
00:22:54,117 --> 00:22:56,028
You're close to him, aren't you?

292
00:22:57,277 --> 00:23:00,235
l was. He died
when l was nine years old.

293
00:23:02,397 --> 00:23:04,308
l never got to know my mother.

294
00:23:05,837 --> 00:23:07,111
l'm sorry.

295
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:13,308
That's got to be tough.

296
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:19,189
Being alone.

297
00:23:27,717 --> 00:23:28,866
What do you say...

298
00:23:29,077 --> 00:23:32,467
...we pack a picnic tomorrow
and hike up to Mount Arecibo?

299
00:23:33,277 --> 00:23:36,155
l don't think l can.
l've got to work.

300
00:23:37,877 --> 00:23:41,153
How about dinner tomorrow night?
l know a great dive.

301
00:23:41,517 --> 00:23:43,075
No, l don't think so.

302
00:23:47,517 --> 00:23:49,553
Ellie, did l miss something?

303
00:23:51,677 --> 00:23:52,746
No.

304
00:23:52,957 --> 00:23:54,709
Shit, l'm late!

305
00:23:55,677 --> 00:23:58,430
l told Kent
that l'd be there at 10:30.

306
00:24:00,957 --> 00:24:02,675
l'm not trying to push you.

307
00:24:02,877 --> 00:24:05,072
l've wanted to look at
this sector for weeks.

308
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,869
Just hang out...

309
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:10,075
...and sleep in.
There's food in the fridge.

310
00:24:11,677 --> 00:24:12,746
How can l reach you?

311
00:24:14,237 --> 00:24:16,467
Just leave your number.
l'll call you.

312
00:24:37,317 --> 00:24:38,227
<i>Dad!</i>

313
00:24:40,197 --> 00:24:42,711
lt's starting,
you're going to miss it!

314
00:24:46,077 --> 00:24:48,193
Dad, there's another one!
Hurry up!

315
00:24:48,437 --> 00:24:50,632
ln a minute, Sparks!
l'm almost done.

316
00:24:50,877 --> 00:24:53,266
There's another one.
Come on, hurry up, Dad!

317
00:25:46,637 --> 00:25:47,786
l'll get the medicine.

318
00:27:04,237 --> 00:27:06,876
l know it's hard
to understand this now...

319
00:27:07,757 --> 00:27:12,069
...but we aren't always meant to know
why things happen the way they do.

320
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,792
Sometimes,
we just have to accept it...

321
00:27:14,997 --> 00:27:16,749
...as God's will.

322
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,674
l should have kept medicine
in the downstairs bathroom.

323
00:27:22,317 --> 00:27:24,467
Then l could've gotten to it sooner.

324
00:27:49,237 --> 00:27:50,511
<i>CQ...</i>

325
00:27:51,677 --> 00:27:54,589
<i>...this is W</i>-<i>9 GFO.</i>
<i>Do you copy?</i>

326
00:27:57,997 --> 00:28:00,192
Dad, this is Ellie.
Come back.

327
00:28:03,437 --> 00:28:05,314
This is Eleanor Arroway...

328
00:28:05,557 --> 00:28:08,435
...transmitting on 14.2 megahertz.

329
00:28:14,877 --> 00:28:16,310
Are you there?

330
00:28:18,357 --> 00:28:19,710
Come back.

331
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,556
Are you there?

332
00:28:28,597 --> 00:28:30,394
<i>Dad, this is Ellie.</i>

333
00:29:01,637 --> 00:29:04,390
Hi, Kent.
What are you doing up so early?

334
00:29:05,557 --> 00:29:06,785
l was thinking...

335
00:29:07,677 --> 00:29:09,588
...we'd make a pretty good team.

336
00:29:10,197 --> 00:29:13,587
We could put together
an ad hoc SETl program.

337
00:29:13,797 --> 00:29:16,027
You know the Very Large Array
in New Mexico?

338
00:29:16,317 --> 00:29:18,433
lt's a dynamite place
to do SETl work...

339
00:29:18,677 --> 00:29:20,349
What are you talking about?

340
00:29:22,717 --> 00:29:24,389
Drumlin pulled the plug.

341
00:29:25,117 --> 00:29:26,072
We're homeless.

342
00:29:39,797 --> 00:29:41,355
lt's true, you pulled the plug?

343
00:29:41,557 --> 00:29:44,025
You can't see it now,
but l'm doing you a favor.

344
00:29:44,197 --> 00:29:48,031
You're too promising a scientist to
waste your gifts on this nonsense.

345
00:29:48,237 --> 00:29:50,148
l don't consider what could be...

346
00:29:50,357 --> 00:29:53,076
...the most important
human discovery nonsense!

347
00:29:53,397 --> 00:29:54,716
400 billion stars...

348
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:57,675
And two probabilities.
One, there's intelligent life...

349
00:29:57,877 --> 00:30:00,266
...but too far away
to contact in your lifetime.

350
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:02,748
-And two!
-You're making a decision...

351
00:30:03,237 --> 00:30:06,149
There's nothing but gases
and carbon compounds...

352
00:30:06,357 --> 00:30:07,346
...and you're wasting your time!

353
00:30:07,637 --> 00:30:10,470
ln the meantime,
you won't be taken seriously.

354
00:30:10,677 --> 00:30:12,269
Your career will be over!

355
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,592
So what?

356
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:15,316
lt's my life!

357
00:30:51,437 --> 00:30:53,826
Hey, Kent.
You were right.

358
00:30:54,237 --> 00:30:57,752
Screw Drumlin. We'll raise the money
ourselves. We'll go to New Mexico.

359
00:30:58,077 --> 00:31:00,227
Chicago's set.
Let me know how it goes.

360
00:31:00,437 --> 00:31:03,235
l've got more corporate stops
on the East Coast for you.

361
00:31:03,437 --> 00:31:06,429
Did that investor from Houston
ever get back to us?

362
00:31:06,677 --> 00:31:08,588
l'll hit him up on my way to L.A.

363
00:31:08,757 --> 00:31:10,793
Beg for some of that
Hollywood money!

364
00:31:10,997 --> 00:31:13,955
They've been making
money off aliens for years.

365
00:31:14,557 --> 00:31:17,151
-Begging is good for the soul.
-We'll see.

366
00:31:17,437 --> 00:31:19,075
Just do me a favor.

367
00:31:19,357 --> 00:31:21,746
Try not to be too...confrontational.

368
00:31:22,197 --> 00:31:24,427
Confrontational? Me?
What do you mean?

369
00:31:24,637 --> 00:31:26,229
l'll see if l left anything.

370
00:31:58,157 --> 00:32:01,786
<i>It's a unique time in our history,</i>
<i>in the history of any civilization.</i>

371
00:32:01,997 --> 00:32:04,636
<i>It's the moment</i>
<i>of the acquisition of technology.</i>

372
00:32:04,837 --> 00:32:07,590
<i>That's the moment</i>
<i>where contact becomes possible.</i>

373
00:32:08,317 --> 00:32:10,547
The Very Large Array
in New Mexico...

374
00:32:10,717 --> 00:32:12,912
...is the key to our chances
for success.

375
00:32:13,077 --> 00:32:15,113
With its 27
linked radio telescopes...

376
00:32:15,317 --> 00:32:18,707
...we can search more accurately
than at any other facility.

377
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:23,433
We've gotten approval to buy the
telescope time from the government.

378
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:26,393
Now all we really need is the money.

379
00:32:27,037 --> 00:32:28,948
A nice presentation, Doctor.

380
00:32:29,637 --> 00:32:32,515
But while our foundation arm
has a mandate to support...

381
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:35,709
...experimental programs,
your proposal...

382
00:32:35,957 --> 00:32:39,791
...seems less like science,
and more like science fiction.

383
00:32:42,157 --> 00:32:43,556
Science fiction.

384
00:32:46,837 --> 00:32:48,156
You're right.

385
00:32:48,957 --> 00:32:50,276
lt's crazy.

386
00:32:51,317 --> 00:32:53,751
ln fact, it's even worse
than that: nuts!

387
00:32:55,757 --> 00:32:57,156
Want to hear something nutty?

388
00:32:57,357 --> 00:32:59,791
Two guys wanted to build
a thing called an airplane.

389
00:32:59,997 --> 00:33:02,909
People go in it and fly like birds.
Ridiculous, right?

390
00:33:03,117 --> 00:33:04,835
What about breaking
the sound barrier...

391
00:33:05,037 --> 00:33:08,632
...or rockets to the moon, or atomic
energy or a mission to Mars?

392
00:33:08,797 --> 00:33:10,435
Science fiction, right?

393
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:16,116
All l'm asking is for you to
just have the tiniest bit of vision.

394
00:33:16,397 --> 00:33:19,594
To step back
and look at the big picture.

395
00:33:19,997 --> 00:33:24,832
Take a chance on something which could
end up the most impactful moment...

396
00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:27,267
...for humanity, for the history...

397
00:33:27,837 --> 00:33:29,111
...of history.

398
00:33:32,717 --> 00:33:33,672
l'm sorry.

399
00:33:34,717 --> 00:33:36,309
l just spent 13 months...

400
00:33:36,877 --> 00:33:39,596
...coming into rooms
and talking to people like you.

401
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:41,751
You're my last chance.

402
00:33:43,197 --> 00:33:44,676
Sorry l wasted your time.

403
00:33:44,917 --> 00:33:45,429
Doctor.

404
00:33:46,277 --> 00:33:47,312
Yes, sir.

405
00:33:59,197 --> 00:34:00,391
You have your money.

406
00:34:03,317 --> 00:34:04,386
Thank you.

407
00:34:06,397 --> 00:34:07,352
Thank you.

408
00:34:53,397 --> 00:34:56,275
Perfect cast!
Come on, fishy!

409
00:34:56,517 --> 00:34:57,996
Frank, look at the size...

410
00:34:58,157 --> 00:35:00,068
...of that son of a bitch!

411
00:35:11,997 --> 00:35:13,874
Welcome back, Dr. C.

412
00:35:14,117 --> 00:35:15,550
How'd it go?

413
00:35:16,237 --> 00:35:17,716
How was the trip?

414
00:35:17,917 --> 00:35:19,350
l've had better.

415
00:35:19,957 --> 00:35:22,869
Drumlin!
ls this a personal vendetta now?

416
00:35:23,077 --> 00:35:26,786
There's been enormous pressure
from other scientists as well.

417
00:35:26,957 --> 00:35:29,949
lt doesn't matter. Hadden's funding
us for 2 more years.

418
00:35:30,157 --> 00:35:34,514
The government doesn't want their
telescopes used by the high priestess...

419
00:35:34,677 --> 00:35:36,588
...of the desert anymore.

420
00:35:37,877 --> 00:35:38,787
What?

421
00:35:38,957 --> 00:35:42,188
Staring at TV static for hours,
listening to washing machines.

422
00:35:42,397 --> 00:35:44,308
These stories get out!

423
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,075
l was seeking patterns in the chaos!

424
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:48,313
lt doesn't matter,
we're a joke to them.

425
00:35:48,477 --> 00:35:49,796
They want us out!

426
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:54,270
We've got 3 months
till the paperwork goes through.

427
00:35:57,957 --> 00:36:00,027
l'll start looking for
other funding.

428
00:36:00,557 --> 00:36:04,186
Could you face reality?
Just this once? We lost.

429
00:36:04,837 --> 00:36:06,156
lt's over.

430
00:36:12,517 --> 00:36:13,632
Fine.

431
00:36:14,277 --> 00:36:15,835
l'm not stopping.

432
00:36:16,357 --> 00:36:19,349
lf l have to, l'll go it alone.
l've done it before.

433
00:37:06,997 --> 00:37:10,546
<i>My guest tonight is author</i>

<i>Yeah, I sure have, Larry.</i>

442
00:37:31,837 --> 00:37:33,953
Fish, l was thinking.

443
00:37:34,437 --> 00:37:38,555
Who would make the best astronomers?
Think about it.

444
00:37:38,877 --> 00:37:43,507
Who has the perfect synthesis
of career and lifestyle?

445
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,547

<i>No, not at all.</i>

449
00:37:52,157 --> 00:37:54,876

<i>fundamentally a better place...</i>

452
00:38:01,117 --> 00:38:03,028
<i>...because of science</i>
<i>and technology?</i>

453
00:38:03,677 --> 00:38:06,066
<i>We shop at home,</i>

454
00:38:06,237 --> 00:38:08,797

<i>...and more</i>
<i>cut off from each other...</i>

456
00:38:11,997 --> 00:38:13,715
<i>...than at any other time</i>

457
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:16,351

458
00:38:16,677 --> 00:38:18,713
<i>...in a hurry to get to the...</i>

459
00:38:32,797 --> 00:38:34,435
<i>We're looking for the meaning.</i>

460
00:38:34,717 --> 00:38:35,991
<i>What is the meaning?</i>

461
00:38:36,157 --> 00:38:38,796
<i>We have mindless jobs,</i>
<i>take frantic vacations.</i>

462
00:38:39,197 --> 00:38:42,075
<i>Deficit finance trips</i>

463
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:45,673

l'm moving the rest.
Confirm coordinates!

484
00:40:35,237 --> 00:40:36,989
Check the status of the array.

485
00:40:37,277 --> 00:40:38,596
She's doing all the dishes.

486
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:39,867
Systems nominal.

487
00:40:45,517 --> 00:40:46,586
Hello.

488
00:40:47,757 --> 00:40:48,792
Full systems check!

489
00:40:49,597 --> 00:40:52,236
<i>Coordinates confirmed.</i>
<i>Willie's checking the system.</i>

490
00:40:52,477 --> 00:40:55,196
Stay on top of
the systems diagnostics!

491
00:40:55,477 --> 00:40:57,115
Check reference point offsets.

492
00:40:57,317 --> 00:41:01,151
And l want you off-axis
on 27 the second we get there!

493
00:41:01,317 --> 00:41:03,751
And tell Willie
to break out the big boy!

494
00:41:05,277 --> 00:41:06,266
Copy that.

495
00:41:07,677 --> 00:41:08,905
Yeah! Go, Ellie!

496
00:41:09,117 --> 00:41:12,154
l hear it on the headphones.
We got to be sure about this.

497
00:41:12,477 --> 00:41:14,547
Give me another array status.

498
00:41:16,317 --> 00:41:19,673
Her four are online,
the rest are tracking in.

499
00:41:22,077 --> 00:41:24,307
But there's a bad drive on 16.

500
00:41:24,517 --> 00:41:26,872
The four are online,

501
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:29,790
<i>There's a bad drive on 16.</i>
<i>Copy that?</i>

<i>What shall I do</i>
<i>about the source queue?</i>

503
00:41:33,317 --> 00:41:35,194
Forget it and hold the queue.

504
00:41:35,517 --> 00:41:39,510
Get ready to set the target frequency
to manual the second we're aligned.

505
00:41:39,717 --> 00:41:43,949
Do you copy? l want you to go
off-axis on 27 the second we're there!

506
00:41:44,157 --> 00:41:46,717
And leave the LO frequency
where it is!

507
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:50,029
Don't let it get away!
lf you lose it, scan the band!

508
00:41:50,237 --> 00:41:52,797
Run every frequency
you can think of.

509
00:41:57,917 --> 00:41:59,191
How you doing?

510
00:42:03,557 --> 00:42:04,626
Talk to me, guys.

511
00:42:04,837 --> 00:42:08,352
Partially polarized moving pulses,
amplitude modulated.

512
00:42:08,557 --> 00:42:12,072
We're locked. Systems are fine.
What's the frequency?

513
00:42:12,317 --> 00:42:13,272
4.46...

514
00:42:13,477 --> 00:42:14,910
...23 gigahertz.

515
00:42:16,677 --> 00:42:18,235
Hydrogen times pi.

516
00:42:18,597 --> 00:42:19,666
Told you!

517
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:21,555
Strong sucker too!

518
00:42:22,557 --> 00:42:24,036
l got it!
l'm patched in!

519
00:42:24,717 --> 00:42:25,752
Let me hear.

520
00:42:31,197 --> 00:42:32,516
Listen to that.

521
00:42:34,717 --> 00:42:36,594
Make me a liar, Fish.

522
00:42:37,037 --> 00:42:39,710
lt could be AWACS
out of Kirkland jamming us.

523
00:42:39,877 --> 00:42:40,992
But l doubt it.

524
00:42:41,237 --> 00:42:43,307
See if F.U.D.D.'s reading it too.

525
00:42:45,317 --> 00:42:47,353
Patch it back
and give me the off-axis.

526
00:42:47,917 --> 00:42:49,509
-We recording?
-Never stopped.

527
00:42:51,517 --> 00:42:52,745
Thank you, Elmer!

528
00:42:52,957 --> 00:42:54,709
AWACS status is negative.

529
00:42:54,877 --> 00:42:55,832
White Sands?

530
00:42:56,077 --> 00:42:57,590
On this frequency? No.

531
00:42:58,077 --> 00:42:59,305
l'll punch up the darks.

532
00:43:02,397 --> 00:43:03,512
How's spying tonight?

533
00:43:04,597 --> 00:43:05,825
Come on!

534
00:43:08,077 --> 00:43:10,432
NORAD's not tracking
any snoops in this vector.

535
00:43:10,837 --> 00:43:12,156
Shuttle's in sleep mode.

536
00:43:12,477 --> 00:43:14,547
Okay, point source confirmed.

537
00:43:14,837 --> 00:43:16,350
Whatever it is, it ain't local.

538
00:43:16,557 --> 00:43:17,353
Position?

539
00:43:17,557 --> 00:43:19,946
l checked interferometry.
Somewhere in Lyra.

540
00:43:20,157 --> 00:43:21,715
-Vega?
-Can't be!

541
00:43:21,957 --> 00:43:23,868
lt's only 26 light years away.

542
00:43:24,077 --> 00:43:25,908
-Peak intensity?
-Coming up!

543
00:43:27,157 --> 00:43:27,828
Vega.

544
00:43:28,597 --> 00:43:32,306
Vega. l scanned it a bunch of times
at Arecibo. lt was always negative.

545
00:43:32,517 --> 00:43:33,427
Got it!

546
00:43:33,597 --> 00:43:35,394
Reading over 100 janskys.

547
00:43:36,077 --> 00:43:38,466
Jesus! l can pick it up on my...

548
00:43:41,277 --> 00:43:42,232
No!

549
00:44:14,157 --> 00:44:15,112
Come on!

550
00:44:17,277 --> 00:44:18,392
lt's restarting.

551
00:44:19,797 --> 00:44:21,469
Wait a minute.
Those are numbers.

552
00:44:21,637 --> 00:44:23,355
That was 3, before it was 2.

553
00:44:24,757 --> 00:44:27,225
Base 10 numbers.
Count and see how far we get.

554
00:44:28,277 --> 00:44:28,789
One.

555
00:44:35,197 --> 00:44:36,152
Seven.

556
00:44:38,877 --> 00:44:40,356
Those are primes.

557
00:44:40,597 --> 00:44:43,634
2, 3, 5, 7 are all prime numbers.

558
00:44:44,077 --> 00:44:45,874
No way that's a natural phenomenon!

559
00:44:46,077 --> 00:44:48,796
Let's just calm down
and pull up the star file on Vega.

560
00:44:50,237 --> 00:44:53,388
lt doesn't make any sense.
The system is too young.

561
00:44:53,597 --> 00:44:55,189
lt can't have a planetary system...

562
00:44:55,357 --> 00:44:58,474
...let alone life
or a technological civilization.

563
00:44:58,717 --> 00:45:01,072
Maybe they're not from there,
they're visiting.

564
00:45:01,277 --> 00:45:04,474
Spacecraft? This system's full
of debris. lt'd get clobbered.

565
00:45:04,877 --> 00:45:08,790
Not if they used their
laser blasters and photon torpedoes.

566
00:45:09,037 --> 00:45:11,835
-That's not funny.
-How else can we explain it!

567
00:45:12,357 --> 00:45:15,190
He's right. lf we go public
with this and we're wrong...

568
00:45:15,357 --> 00:45:17,507
...it's over. We're cooked.

569
00:45:20,237 --> 00:45:21,556
l wish Kent was here.

570
00:45:21,757 --> 00:45:25,033
Whatever it is, let's do something.
Vega will set.

571
00:45:28,317 --> 00:45:32,469
<i>Position confirmed. We've got 4.4623</i>
<i>gigahertz, confirmed.</i>

572
00:45:32,637 --> 00:45:35,390
<i>We've got 112 janskys.</i>

573
00:45:35,677 --> 00:45:37,793
Do you have a source location yet?

574
00:45:40,277 --> 00:45:42,552
<i>We put it right smack in the middle.</i>

575
00:45:43,197 --> 00:45:44,391
<i>Vega.</i>

576
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:49,275
Thanks. Keep tracking
and we'll get back to you.

577
00:45:49,517 --> 00:45:50,745
<i>Right</i>-<i>o.</i>

578
00:46:01,597 --> 00:46:03,269
101 . The pulse sequenced...

579
00:46:03,437 --> 00:46:06,713
...through every prime number
between 2 and 101 .

580
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,149
Who do we call now?

581
00:46:13,277 --> 00:46:14,232
Everybody.

582
00:46:21,677 --> 00:46:25,067
<i>The rumors are flying,</i>
<i>the implications extraordinary.</i>

583
00:46:25,277 --> 00:46:27,029
<i>Detection of an unidentified...</i>

584
00:46:27,277 --> 00:46:31,316
<i>...radio source from space</i>
<i>can neither be confirmed nor denied.</i>

585
00:46:31,557 --> 00:46:33,354
<i>But the military arriving...</i>

586
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:36,993
Sources close to the VLA
report they have been contacted...

587
00:46:37,197 --> 00:46:39,108
...by some form
of intelligent being...

588
00:46:39,317 --> 00:46:43,674
...living outside our solar system.
Again, there is no confirmation.

589
00:46:46,677 --> 00:46:48,668
l want all of these people
out of here.

590
00:46:49,477 --> 00:46:50,751
Where's the girl?

591
00:46:55,197 --> 00:46:56,471
<i>22 stations worldwide...</i>

592
00:46:56,677 --> 00:46:58,030
...now confirm the signal.

593
00:46:58,197 --> 00:46:59,789
Vega's now below our horizon.

594
00:46:59,997 --> 00:47:02,227
You're hearing the signal
from the Russian...

595
00:47:02,437 --> 00:47:03,995
Get decryption people here.

596
00:47:04,197 --> 00:47:06,153
Lunacharsky's visiting at Cal Tech.

597
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:07,676
Explain this to me.

598
00:47:07,877 --> 00:47:11,756
lf the source of the signal is so
sophisticated...why the remedial math?

599
00:47:11,957 --> 00:47:13,310
Why not just speak English?

600
00:47:13,477 --> 00:47:16,753
Maybe because 70%of the planet
speaks other languages.

601
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,636
Mathematics is the
only truly universal language.

602
00:47:20,277 --> 00:47:22,711
lt's no coincidence
that they're using primes.

603
00:47:22,957 --> 00:47:23,833
l don't get it.

604
00:47:24,117 --> 00:47:25,266
Prime numbers.

605
00:47:25,477 --> 00:47:28,833
lntegers only divisible
by themselves and 1 .

606
00:47:31,677 --> 00:47:34,396
We think this may be a beacon,
an announcement...

607
00:47:34,677 --> 00:47:36,349
...to get our attention.

608
00:47:36,517 --> 00:47:40,112
lf it's attention you want,
you got that. One thing: Vega.

609
00:47:40,317 --> 00:47:43,627
People have looked at Vega
for years, with no results.

610
00:47:43,797 --> 00:47:46,630
Yesterday they start
broadcasting primes. Why?

611
00:47:46,877 --> 00:47:48,151
lt's hardly yesterday.

612
00:47:48,357 --> 00:47:50,871
The signal's been transmitting
for 26 years.

613
00:47:52,117 --> 00:47:53,550
Excuse me, who are you?

614
00:47:53,757 --> 00:47:56,066
Michael Kitz,
National Security Advisor.

615
00:47:56,277 --> 00:47:57,551
Your reputation...

616
00:47:57,717 --> 00:48:00,993
First, ask the gentlemen
with the guns to wait outside.

617
00:48:01,637 --> 00:48:03,628
This is a civilian facility.

618
00:48:09,917 --> 00:48:11,270
With all due respect...

619
00:48:11,477 --> 00:48:12,307
Excuse me.

620
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,873
Hi! l'm so glad you're back!

621
00:48:16,437 --> 00:48:17,586
Come hear this.

622
00:48:18,277 --> 00:48:19,551
ls this great?

623
00:48:19,717 --> 00:48:21,992
-Who are all these people?
-l have no idea.

624
00:48:22,197 --> 00:48:25,234
Sit down. We need help
with the spectrum analysis.

625
00:48:25,437 --> 00:48:26,950
-l'll get on it.
-Headsets.

626
00:48:27,197 --> 00:48:29,267
l'll just come right to the point.

627
00:48:29,477 --> 00:48:33,311
Announcing this all over the world may
well be a breach of national security.

628
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:35,115
lt's not a person-to-person call.

629
00:48:35,317 --> 00:48:39,276
You think a civilization sending this
message intends it just for Americans?

630
00:48:39,477 --> 00:48:41,229
You might have consulted us.

631
00:48:41,597 --> 00:48:45,431
-The contents could be very sensitive.
-You want to classify prime numbers?

632
00:48:46,037 --> 00:48:49,234
Due to earth's rotation, we're
in line with Vega only hours a day.

633
00:48:49,437 --> 00:48:53,589
The only way to monitor the signal
is to cooperate with other stations.

634
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:57,949
lf Dr. Arroway hadn't acted quickly,
we'd have lost key elements.

635
00:48:58,117 --> 00:48:59,596
Fine, they've got the primes.

636
00:48:59,837 --> 00:49:02,476
But if a more significant
transmission is to come...

637
00:49:02,717 --> 00:49:04,594
We need help to receive and decode.

638
00:49:04,797 --> 00:49:07,311
You understand
that my job is to protect...

639
00:49:08,557 --> 00:49:10,388
-Listen.
-l hear it.

640
00:49:10,677 --> 00:49:11,587
Hear what?

641
00:49:11,797 --> 00:49:12,707
Harmonic.

642
00:49:12,917 --> 00:49:16,592
Bingo! l had Willie ask Rattan
to retune to 8.9247 gigahertz.

643
00:49:16,757 --> 00:49:18,315
There's a lot more here.

644
00:49:18,517 --> 00:49:21,077
-Get on the negative sideband.
-l'm already on it.

645
00:49:21,237 --> 00:49:22,306
What is it?

646
00:49:22,517 --> 00:49:23,950
Another signal!

647
00:49:24,117 --> 00:49:26,870
A second signal at double
the frequency. Looks like...

648
00:49:27,677 --> 00:49:28,951
Get a TV monitor!

649
00:49:29,677 --> 00:49:31,474
Patch it into the image processor.

650
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:32,871
Want the new data?

651
00:49:33,077 --> 00:49:34,795
Yeah, the new one we just recorded.

652
00:49:34,997 --> 00:49:36,874
David, explain this to me, please.

653
00:49:37,077 --> 00:49:39,750
There's another signal.
Looks like a TV transmission.

654
00:49:39,957 --> 00:49:40,867
We're hot.

655
00:49:41,117 --> 00:49:43,711
Go get the blinds.
There is a lot of glare.

656
00:49:44,757 --> 00:49:46,110
You're patched in.

657
00:49:46,357 --> 00:49:49,633
lt's definitely an image.
Let's try and stabilize it.

658
00:49:54,197 --> 00:49:55,835
What do you make of that?

659
00:49:56,037 --> 00:49:58,915
lt's two different
interlaced frames. l'm framing one.

660
00:50:02,117 --> 00:50:04,756
-lt's just noise.
-Trying frame two.

661
00:50:05,917 --> 00:50:09,114
l've got an offset carrier.
l think it's audio.

662
00:50:09,317 --> 00:50:10,511
Plug it in!

663
00:50:14,677 --> 00:50:15,871
Center that segment.

664
00:50:16,077 --> 00:50:17,146
Centering.

665
00:50:21,237 --> 00:50:22,511
Can you clean it up?

666
00:50:22,677 --> 00:50:24,110
l'm working on it.

667
00:50:36,517 --> 00:50:37,916
What the hell...?

668
00:50:38,597 --> 00:50:39,825
Try zooming out.

669
00:50:43,677 --> 00:50:44,587
Freeze!

670
00:50:44,757 --> 00:50:45,985
Reverse values.

671
00:50:47,557 --> 00:50:49,275
Try zooming out again.

672
00:50:53,117 --> 00:50:55,187
Rotate 90 degrees counterclock...

673
00:50:56,677 --> 00:50:58,190
My God!

674
00:51:04,637 --> 00:51:06,036
What's going on?

675
00:51:06,557 --> 00:51:08,832
You're not going to believe this.

676
00:51:21,717 --> 00:51:23,389
Does anybody speak German?

677
00:51:24,797 --> 00:51:27,072
"l declare the Games in Berlin...

678
00:51:28,117 --> 00:51:29,755
...at the celebration...

679
00:51:29,957 --> 00:51:32,710
...of the first Olympics
of the New Era...

680
00:51:32,917 --> 00:51:34,191
...as opened."

681
00:51:44,517 --> 00:51:45,916
Get me the White House.

682
00:51:46,677 --> 00:51:48,986
20 million people died
defeating the bastard...

683
00:51:49,197 --> 00:51:51,870
...and he's our first ambassador
to outer space?

684
00:51:52,077 --> 00:51:55,228
The broadcast of the '36 Olympics
was the first TV transmission...

685
00:51:55,477 --> 00:51:56,910
...that went into space.

686
00:51:57,117 --> 00:52:00,348
Sending it back is a way of saying,
"Hello, we heard you."

687
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:02,712
Or, <i>"Sieg Heil,</i>
you're our kind of people."

688
00:52:02,917 --> 00:52:05,306
Hitler's politics
have nothing to do with this.

689
00:52:05,517 --> 00:52:09,032
lt's unlikely they understood it.
People must understand...

690
00:52:09,197 --> 00:52:11,427
The people are
in very good hands, Doctor.

691
00:52:11,637 --> 00:52:13,309
We'll take it from here.

692
00:52:14,317 --> 00:52:16,228
Smile, folks. We're on.

693
00:52:16,517 --> 00:52:18,712
<i>A message of unknown origin</i>
<i>from deep space...</i>

694
00:52:18,917 --> 00:52:22,432

<i>...and that he won't be taking</i>
<i>any questions from the press.</i>

698
00:52:35,837 --> 00:52:37,065
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

699
00:52:39,837 --> 00:52:41,907
<i>I'm glad to be joined by my...</i>

700
00:52:42,077 --> 00:52:43,908
<i>...Science and Technology Advisor.</i>

701
00:52:45,597 --> 00:52:48,350
<i>This is the product</i>
<i>of years of exploration...</i>

702
00:52:48,517 --> 00:52:51,634
<i>...by some of the world's</i>
<i>most distinguished scientists.</i>

703
00:52:51,837 --> 00:52:53,429
<i>Like all discoveries...</i>

704
00:52:53,597 --> 00:52:55,827
<i>...this one will continue</i>
<i>to be reviewed...</i>

705
00:52:56,077 --> 00:52:57,066
<i>...examined...</i>

706
00:52:57,237 --> 00:52:58,716
<i>...and scrutinized.</i>

707
00:52:58,917 --> 00:53:01,795
<i>It must be confirmed</i>
<i>by other scientists.</i>

708
00:53:02,037 --> 00:53:03,152
<i>But clearly...</i>

709
00:53:03,717 --> 00:53:07,027
<i>...the fact that this is being</i>
<i>explored is a vindication...</i>

710
00:53:07,837 --> 00:53:11,512
Fish, what is the story over here?
l thought Ellie was supposed to be on.

711
00:53:11,677 --> 00:53:13,110
l don't know.

712
00:53:13,717 --> 00:53:14,991
Guys?

713
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,837
Those interlaced frames
we thought were noise?

714
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:23,357
This has structure.
l'm hearing structure.

715
00:53:24,637 --> 00:53:26,867
<i>If this discovery is confirmed...</i>

716
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:30,552
<i>...it will be one of the most stunning</i>
<i>insights into our universe...</i>

717
00:53:30,717 --> 00:53:32,673
<i>...that science has ever uncovered.</i>

718
00:53:33,157 --> 00:53:35,432
<i>Its implications</i>
<i>are as far</i>-<i>reaching...</i>

719
00:53:35,637 --> 00:53:38,105
<i>...and awe</i>-<i>inspiring</i>
<i>as can be imagined.</i>

720
00:53:38,397 --> 00:53:41,628
<i>Even as it promises answers</i>
<i>to some of our oldest questions...</i>

721
00:53:41,877 --> 00:53:43,356
<i>...it poses still others...</i>

722
00:53:43,557 --> 00:53:45,115
<i>...even more fundamental.</i>

723
00:53:45,317 --> 00:53:47,148
<i>We will continue</i>
<i>to listen closely...</i>

724
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:48,836
<i>...to what it has to say...</i>

725
00:53:48,997 --> 00:53:51,033
<i>...as we continue</i>
<i>the search for answers...</i>

726
00:53:51,237 --> 00:53:52,431
<i>...and for knowledge...</i>

727
00:53:52,677 --> 00:53:54,872
<i>...that is as old</i>
<i>as humanity itself...</i>

728
00:53:55,077 --> 00:53:57,875
<i>...but essential</i>
<i>to our people's future.</i>

729
00:53:58,277 --> 00:53:58,948
<i>Thank you.</i>

730
00:53:59,157 --> 00:54:01,910
ls there a renewed assessment
of security threat?

731
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:05,109
<i>I'll answer your questions</i>
<i>after a few corrections.</i>

732
00:54:05,277 --> 00:54:06,915
<i>The message was received Friday...</i>

733
00:54:07,157 --> 00:54:09,113
<i>...at 6:31 a.m.</i>
<i>Mountain Standard Time.</i>

734
00:54:09,317 --> 00:54:10,875
<i>It was largely mathematical...</i>

735
00:54:11,037 --> 00:54:13,631
<i>...and in spite of reports</i>
<i>to the contrary...</i>

736
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,306
<i>...appears to be</i>
<i>completely benign in nature.</i>

737
00:54:16,517 --> 00:54:20,305
<i>Let me say that again.</i>
<i>The message is completely benign.</i>

738
00:54:20,517 --> 00:54:23,509
<i>The President has contacted</i>
<i>the world's heads of state...</i>

739
00:54:23,717 --> 00:54:26,390
<i>...and every security measure</i>
<i>is being taken.</i>

740
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:29,555
<i>To better explain the events</i>
<i>of the last 48 hours...</i>

741
00:54:29,757 --> 00:54:33,989
<i>...is the leader of the scientific team</i>
<i>that made this remarkable discovery...</i>

742
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:38,071
<i>...Dr. David Drumlin, special</i>
<i>Science Advisor to the President.</i>

743
00:54:45,757 --> 00:54:47,076
<i>Thank you, Rachel.</i>

744
00:54:47,397 --> 00:54:48,466
<i>Hello.</i>

745
00:54:50,317 --> 00:54:52,626
<i>In 1936,</i>
<i>a very faint television signal...</i>

746
00:54:52,837 --> 00:54:56,955
<i>...transmitted the opening ceremonies</i>
<i>of the Olympic Games as a show...</i>

747
00:54:57,117 --> 00:54:59,506
<i>...of German superior technology.</i>

748
00:55:00,517 --> 00:55:04,476
<i>That signal left Earth at the speed</i>
<i>of light and 26 years later...</i>

749
00:55:04,717 --> 00:55:08,187
<i>...arrived in the vicinity</i>
<i>of the star we call Vega.</i>

750
00:55:09,317 --> 00:55:12,992
<i>That signal has been sent back to us</i>
<i>hugely amplified...</i>

751
00:55:13,357 --> 00:55:16,190
<i>...an unmistakable</i>
<i>sign of intelligence.</i>

752
00:55:16,357 --> 00:55:17,392
<i>Kent, go ahead.</i>

753
00:55:17,597 --> 00:55:21,749
<i>The Adolf transmission used 25 frames</i>
<i>per second but we're receiving 50.</i>

754
00:55:21,957 --> 00:55:25,632
<i>So we put the other 25</i>
<i>through search algorithms.</i>

755
00:55:25,837 --> 00:55:28,305
<i>We found a series of markers</i>
<i>on the top of each frame.</i>

756
00:55:28,517 --> 00:55:30,189
-<i>Are you ready?</i>
-Yeah, go ahead!

757
00:55:30,397 --> 00:55:31,546
<i>Send it, Willie.</i>

758
00:55:31,717 --> 00:55:33,150
<i>Here it comes.</i>

759
00:55:36,397 --> 00:55:37,591
<i>It's digital...</i>

760
00:55:37,797 --> 00:55:41,790
<i>...massive amounts of data which</i>
<i>extend right to the higher harmonics.</i>

761
00:55:42,437 --> 00:55:43,836
Jackpot!

762
00:55:45,037 --> 00:55:46,914
All right, as you'll see...

763
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:50,353
...interlaced with the frames
of the original Hitler image...

764
00:55:50,557 --> 00:55:53,276
...we found these sections.

765
00:55:53,477 --> 00:55:56,787
We thought they were noise,
but they're actually data...

766
00:55:56,957 --> 00:55:58,231
...huge amounts of it.

767
00:55:58,437 --> 00:56:02,589
When we combine this with the data
from the original signal...

768
00:56:02,757 --> 00:56:05,908
...we get
these encrypted pages of text.

769
00:56:06,157 --> 00:56:10,116
No two are alike and
we've uncovered over 10,000 already.

770
00:56:10,277 --> 00:56:12,347
What does it mean, Doctor?

771
00:56:12,837 --> 00:56:15,476
We have no idea.
lt could be anything.

772
00:56:15,717 --> 00:56:17,753
Volume 1 of an
<i>Encyclopedia Galactica.</i>

773
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:20,477
lnstructions for us
on their colonization procedures.

774
00:56:20,637 --> 00:56:22,867
Moses with a few billion
new commandments.

775
00:56:23,077 --> 00:56:25,113
How long will it take to decode it?

776
00:56:25,357 --> 00:56:28,508
lt could take forever.
We really need a primer...

777
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:31,669
We need to get
the best decryption people we have.

778
00:56:32,317 --> 00:56:36,356
l intend to use the VLA
as my command post.

779
00:56:36,517 --> 00:56:39,827
ln the meantime, my office
has made out a preliminary budget.

780
00:56:39,997 --> 00:56:41,225
Wait a minute.

781
00:56:41,437 --> 00:56:43,667
This is a privately-funded
operation.

782
00:56:43,837 --> 00:56:46,032
We lease dish time
from the government...

783
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:48,797
This is a clear-cut case of eminent
domain.

784
00:56:48,957 --> 00:56:51,994
l'm recommending to the President
we militarize this project.

785
00:56:52,237 --> 00:56:54,592
What?! This is my project!

786
00:56:54,757 --> 00:56:57,954
Nobody knows more about this
than l do. David, tell them...

787
00:56:58,117 --> 00:57:01,075
Excuse me!
Could we calm down here?

788
00:57:01,477 --> 00:57:02,671
l'm going to recommend that...

789
00:57:02,837 --> 00:57:05,749
...Dr. Drumlin coordinate
the decryption effort.

790
00:57:05,917 --> 00:57:09,114
But in light of Dr. Arroway's
long experience in these matters...

791
00:57:09,317 --> 00:57:13,310
...for the time being, she will
direct operations at the VLA...

792
00:57:13,477 --> 00:57:17,948
...understanding that future discoveries
will be kept in strict confidence...

793
00:57:18,157 --> 00:57:20,307
...until such time
as the President...

794
00:57:20,517 --> 00:57:24,192
...can decide the most suitable
course of action. Understood?

795
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:25,312
Yes.

796
00:57:25,557 --> 00:57:27,752
<i>This is CNN Breaking News.</i>

797
00:57:28,277 --> 00:57:31,110
<i>The President</i>
<i>called the message from Vega...</i>

798
00:57:31,317 --> 00:57:33,387
<i>... "a stunning insight</i>
<i>into our universe</i>...<i>"</i>

799
00:57:33,597 --> 00:57:38,273
<i>Attendance at religious services has</i>
<i>risen a dramatic 39%in recent days.</i>

800

<i>with neo</i>-<i>Nazi protesters.</i>

801
00:57:42,357 --> 00:57:44,393
<i>So, there's life on other planets.</i>

802
00:57:44,597 --> 00:57:48,033
<i>Boy, this will really change</i>
<i>the Miss Universe contest.</i>

803
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:52,829
<i>Health officials worldwide are concerned</i>
<i>that the message from Vega...</i>

804
00:57:52,997 --> 00:57:55,557
<i>...might trigger</i>
<i>a rash of mass suicides...</i>

805
00:57:55,717 --> 00:57:58,231
<i>...not unlike recent cult deaths</i>
<i>near San Diego</i>...

806
00:57:58,477 --> 00:58:00,354
<i>Even a scientist must admit...</i>

807
00:58:00,517 --> 00:58:04,749
<i>...there are some pretty serious</i>
<i>religious overtones to all this.</i>

808
00:58:04,997 --> 00:58:07,147
<i>Here's someone whose organization...</i>

809
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,672
<i>...is accused of conducting</i>
<i>its own inquisition:</i>

810
00:58:09,917 --> 00:58:12,556
<i>Richard Rank,</i>
<i>head of the Conservative Coalition.</i>

811
00:58:12,797 --> 00:58:13,786
<i>Thank you.</i>

812
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:17,950
<i>This is yet another example of science</i>
<i>intruding into matters of faith.</i>

813
00:58:18,997 --> 00:58:22,148
<i>This means they</i>
<i>have been reacting to TV signals...</i>

814
00:58:22,397 --> 00:58:25,116
<i>...from the 1930s.</i>
<i>They're just getting them.</i>

815
00:58:25,357 --> 00:58:28,906
<i>Imagine how disappointed</i>
<i>they'll be if they're Cubs fans.</i>

816
00:58:29,197 --> 00:58:32,109
<i>We now go to Jeremy Roth,</i>
<i>who is reporting...</i>

817
00:58:32,277 --> 00:58:35,587
<i>...from the Very Large Array</i>
<i>near Socorro, New Mexico.</i>

818
00:58:35,837 --> 00:58:37,190

<i>...thousands of believers</i>

821
00:58:42,037 --> 00:58:45,586
<i>...to descend upon the VLA facility</i>
<i>here in the desert of New Mexico.</i>

822
00:58:45,797 --> 00:58:48,357
<i>Many have come to protest,</i>
<i>many to pray...</i>

823
00:58:48,517 --> 00:58:52,988

824
00:58:58,397 --> 00:59:00,831
<i>Well, I saw the thing</i>
<i>coming out of the sky</i>

825
00:59:01,117 --> 00:59:04,154
<i>It had one long horn</i>
<i>and one big eye.</i>

826
00:59:04,357 --> 00:59:06,917
<i>I commenced to shaking</i>

829
01:00:06,437 --> 01:00:08,155
But they have failed!

830
01:00:08,637 --> 01:00:11,310
lt's the same people who,
again and again...

831
01:00:11,517 --> 01:00:13,553
...have brought us
to the brink of destruction!

832

Who've polluted our air,
who've poisoned our water!

833
01:00:18,757 --> 01:00:20,793
Now these scientists...

834
01:00:21,637 --> 01:00:23,514
...have had their chance.

835
01:00:23,717 --> 01:00:26,709
Are these the kind of people...

836
01:00:27,037 --> 01:00:30,712

<i>More on the quest for the message's</i>

843
01:00:54,877 --> 01:00:56,629
They have to line up somehow.

844
01:00:56,837 --> 01:00:58,668
This one doesn't fit, either.

845
01:00:58,917 --> 01:01:01,431
We've tried over
a million permutations.

846
01:01:01,637 --> 01:01:04,834
Always, l can only get
three corners to fit.

847
01:01:05,797 --> 01:01:07,867
l don't understand
their significance.

848
01:01:49,517 --> 01:01:50,666
Somebody broke in...

849
01:01:56,797 --> 01:01:57,786
Hello?

850
01:01:58,717 --> 01:02:01,789
Whoever you are,
you broke into the database...

851
01:02:04,677 --> 01:02:05,951
What? Now?

852
01:02:08,677 --> 01:02:09,792
Where?

853
01:02:22,277 --> 01:02:23,676
l'll be there.

854
01:02:50,117 --> 01:02:51,516
You should feel fortunate.

855
01:02:52,197 --> 01:02:53,596

Mr. Hadden.

859
01:03:34,397 --> 01:03:37,434
l've had my eye on you

860

861
01:03:43,357 --> 01:03:45,712
And when it comes
to my investments...

862
01:03:47,357 --> 01:03:49,917
...l always do my homework.

863
01:03:54,437 --> 01:03:56,155
Eleanor Ann Arroway...

864
01:03:56,317 --> 01:03:58,706
...born 25th August, 1964...

865
01:03:58,917 --> 01:04:00,475
...De Pere, Wisconsin.

866
01:04:00,637 --> 01:04:04,710
Mother, Joanna, died from
complications during childbirth.

867
01:04:05,397 --> 01:04:07,991
Early testing indicated
high predisposition...

868
01:04:08,157 --> 01:04:11,069
...towards science and mathematics.

869
01:04:11,717 --> 01:04:12,866
Father, Theodore...

870
01:04:13,037 --> 01:04:16,427
...advised to provide enrichment
activities in these areas...

871
01:04:16,677 --> 01:04:19,191
...did so conscientiously
until his death...

872
01:04:19,357 --> 01:04:23,145
...from myocardial infarction,
November 10, 1974.

873
01:04:24,477 --> 01:04:27,674
You graduated from high school
in 1979...

874
01:04:27,917 --> 01:04:29,794
...almost two full years early.

875
01:04:31,197 --> 01:04:33,074
Awarded full scholarship, M.l.T...

876
01:04:33,237 --> 01:04:35,353
...graduated magna cum laude.

877
01:04:36,277 --> 01:04:37,915
Doctoral work, Cal Tech...

878
01:04:38,077 --> 01:04:41,069
...where you worked
on the lanthanide-doped ruby maser...

879
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:45,475
...dramatically increasing
the sensitivity of radio telescopes.

880
01:04:45,877 --> 01:04:49,313
Subsequently offered a teaching
position at Harvard University...

881
01:04:49,477 --> 01:04:52,469
...which you turned down
to pursue SETl work...

882
01:04:52,637 --> 01:04:55,993
...at the Arecibo Observatory
in Puerto Rico.

883
01:04:58,237 --> 01:05:00,626
Changes in N.S.F. policy...

884
01:05:01,077 --> 01:05:04,274
...gave rise to certain
funding problems...

885
01:05:05,277 --> 01:05:06,710
...at which point...

886
01:05:07,197 --> 01:05:09,108
...you came to my attention.

887
01:05:10,437 --> 01:05:12,632
You compromised our security codes.

888
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:16,629
Once upon a time...

889
01:05:18,557 --> 01:05:20,593
...l was a hell of an engineer.

890
01:05:20,957 --> 01:05:22,868
Please, sit, Doctor.

891
01:05:23,477 --> 01:05:24,512
l have guests so rarely...

892
01:05:24,677 --> 01:05:27,828
...it's important
they feel welcome in my home.

893
01:05:28,837 --> 01:05:30,111
You live here?

894
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:34,874
l find it convenient
to keep my interests...

895
01:05:36,157 --> 01:05:37,112
...mobile.

896
01:05:39,677 --> 01:05:43,670
Anyway, l've had my fill
of life on the ground.

897
01:05:45,397 --> 01:05:46,876
l guess l should...

898
01:05:47,477 --> 01:05:50,867
l guess l should thank you for
having bailed me out all that time.

899
01:05:55,997 --> 01:05:58,067
l know a good bet when l see one.

900
01:06:00,357 --> 01:06:03,030
Earl Grey.
No sugar, no milk, l believe.

901
01:06:06,237 --> 01:06:08,034
What am l doing here?

902
01:06:17,917 --> 01:06:20,954
The powers that be
have been very busy lately...

903
01:06:21,757 --> 01:06:23,509
...positioning themselves...

904
01:06:23,717 --> 01:06:26,390
...for the game of the millennium.

905
01:06:32,957 --> 01:06:35,471
Maybe l can help deal you back in.

906
01:06:36,797 --> 01:06:38,992
l didn't realize that l was out.

907
01:06:39,517 --> 01:06:41,269
No. Maybe not out...

908
01:06:42,397 --> 01:06:44,627
...but certainly
being handed your hat.

909
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:53,392
l've had a long time
to make enemies, Doctor.

910
01:06:56,797 --> 01:06:58,355
There are many governments...

911
01:06:58,557 --> 01:07:00,036
...business interests...

912
01:07:00,637 --> 01:07:04,471
...even religious leaders that would
like to see me depart this earth.

913
01:07:05,917 --> 01:07:08,306
And l'll grant them their wish
soon enough.

914
01:07:08,797 --> 01:07:12,312
But before l do,
l wish to make a small contribution.

915
01:07:13,117 --> 01:07:17,429
A final gesture of goodwill to the
people of this planet who have given...

916
01:07:20,157 --> 01:07:22,717
...from whom l have taken so much.

917
01:07:26,037 --> 01:07:27,470
You found the primer.

918
01:07:29,757 --> 01:07:30,872
Clever girl!

919
01:07:31,957 --> 01:07:32,707
Lights.

920
01:07:40,957 --> 01:07:43,551
Pages and pages of data.

921
01:07:44,157 --> 01:07:47,035
Over 63,000 in all.

922
01:07:47,317 --> 01:07:49,387
And on the perimeter of each...

923
01:07:49,597 --> 01:07:52,987
Alignment symbols, registration
marks, but they don't line up.

924
01:07:53,477 --> 01:07:54,626
They do...

925
01:07:54,917 --> 01:07:56,589
...if you think like a Vegan.

926
01:07:57,477 --> 01:08:00,310
An alien intelligence
has got be more advanced...

927
01:08:00,477 --> 01:08:04,311
...and that means efficiency
functioning on multiple levels...

928
01:08:04,517 --> 01:08:06,269
...and in multiple...

929
01:08:06,477 --> 01:08:08,229
...dimensions.

930
01:08:11,997 --> 01:08:13,908
Yes, of course!

931
01:08:14,517 --> 01:08:15,506
Where's the primer?

932
01:08:15,997 --> 01:08:17,271
You'll see.

933
01:08:17,757 --> 01:08:22,069
Every three-dimensional page
contains a piece of the primer.

934
01:08:24,157 --> 01:08:27,513
There it was all the time,
staring you in the face.

935
01:08:28,597 --> 01:08:32,476
Buried within the message itself
is the key to decoding it.

936
01:08:32,757 --> 01:08:35,988
Within the layering of the matrix,
we have these basic equations:

937
01:08:37,637 --> 01:08:41,471
So with this very elementary foundation,
they have given us a kind of...

938
01:08:41,757 --> 01:08:43,987
...general scientific vocabulary.

939
01:08:44,197 --> 01:08:46,427
We now have the symbols
for true and false...

940
01:08:46,597 --> 01:08:47,825
This was the key...

941
01:08:48,037 --> 01:08:50,392
...that allowed us to decipher
their language...

942
01:08:50,597 --> 01:08:54,192
...for physics, geometry, chemistry.
Next frame, Ellie.

943
01:08:55,477 --> 01:08:59,106
Yes, and when we apply this
to the rest of the message...

944
01:08:59,997 --> 01:09:00,952
...we find this.

945
01:09:05,277 --> 01:09:08,587
Those look like engineering
schematics, almost like blueprints.

946
01:09:09,917 --> 01:09:10,872
Yes.

947
01:09:11,157 --> 01:09:14,308
lt is our belief that
the message contains instructions...

948
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:17,827
...for building something,
some kind of machine.

949
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:20,797
A machine?
That does what, Doctor?

950
01:09:21,117 --> 01:09:23,267
We don't know.
lt might be some type...

951
01:09:24,157 --> 01:09:28,628
...of advanced communication device,
or a teaching machine of some kind.

952
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:31,231
Or it might be...

953
01:09:31,557 --> 01:09:33,149
...some kind of a transport.

954
01:09:33,597 --> 01:09:35,986
-Transport?
-There's no proof of that.

955
01:09:36,197 --> 01:09:39,633
The fact is you don't know
what it does. lt could be anything.

956
01:09:39,957 --> 01:09:43,188
A Trojan Horse. We build it
and out pours the entire Vegan army.

957
01:09:43,477 --> 01:09:45,866
Why risk the personnel?
lt could be a weapon.

958
01:09:46,077 --> 01:09:48,307
Right.
Some kind of a Doomsday Machine.

959
01:09:48,477 --> 01:09:50,786
Every time they detect
a new civilization...

960
01:09:50,957 --> 01:09:53,232
...they fax
construction plans from space.

961
01:09:53,437 --> 01:09:56,907
We poor saps build this thing
and blow ourselves to kingdom come.

962
01:09:57,117 --> 01:10:00,587
There's no reason to believe
their intentions are hostile.

963
01:10:00,957 --> 01:10:04,313
Why is it the egghead position
that aliens are always benign?

964
01:10:05,197 --> 01:10:06,676
We pose no threat to them.

965
01:10:06,877 --> 01:10:09,311
lt'd be like us
going out of our way...

966
01:10:09,597 --> 01:10:11,189
...to destroy microbes
on an anthill.

967
01:10:11,397 --> 01:10:12,830
lnteresting analogy.

968
01:10:13,357 --> 01:10:14,312
How guilty would we feel...

969
01:10:14,517 --> 01:10:17,156
...if we destroyed a few microbes
on an anthill?

970
01:10:17,397 --> 01:10:18,512
l hope you're right.

971
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:19,786
l really do.

972
01:10:19,997 --> 01:10:23,353
But my job is to protect American
lives from any threat...

973
01:10:23,517 --> 01:10:25,553
...so l am obligated
to assume the worst.

974
01:10:25,757 --> 01:10:27,668
Yes, and l am forced
to agree with you.

975
01:10:27,877 --> 01:10:29,276
My problem is this:

976
01:10:29,917 --> 01:10:32,989
The content of that message
is morally ambiguous at best.

977
01:10:33,597 --> 01:10:36,953
Our internal numbers show
support for this is incredibly soft.

978
01:10:37,157 --> 01:10:39,717
lf the President
stays this course...

979
01:10:39,877 --> 01:10:42,550
...his numbers will be going
south like ducks in winter.

980
01:10:42,837 --> 01:10:43,826
This is nuts!

981
01:10:43,997 --> 01:10:44,952
Excuse me...

982
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:46,112
...Miss.

983
01:10:46,597 --> 01:10:48,986
We know nothing
of these creatures' values.

984
01:10:49,317 --> 01:10:51,626
We don't even know
whether they believe in God.

985
01:10:51,837 --> 01:10:53,589
This doesn't make any sense. lf...

986
01:10:53,757 --> 01:10:55,509
Excuse me, Dr. Arroway.

987
01:10:55,677 --> 01:10:58,066
We won't be suppressing
any opinions here today.

988
01:10:58,917 --> 01:11:00,953
No, of course not.
l understand.

989
01:11:01,917 --> 01:11:03,316
What l meant to say...

990
01:11:03,877 --> 01:11:06,914
...is the message was written
in the language of science.

991
01:11:07,357 --> 01:11:10,554
lf it was religious in nature,
it should have taken the form...

992
01:11:10,717 --> 01:11:13,311
...of a burning bush
or a voice from the sky.

993
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:15,513
But a voice from the sky...

994
01:11:16,557 --> 01:11:19,025
...is exactly what you found,
Doctor Arroway.

995
01:11:22,557 --> 01:11:24,195
l'm sorry l'm late, ma'am.

996
01:11:25,917 --> 01:11:29,592
l agree with Mr. Rank
that there are unavoidable...

997
01:11:29,757 --> 01:11:31,827
...religious implications at stake.

998
01:11:31,997 --> 01:11:34,306
But that doesn't justify
being an alarmist.

999
01:11:36,197 --> 01:11:38,427
l hope that we can find
a common ground...

1000
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:41,789
...break through obstacles
that may have kept us apart.

1001
01:11:42,717 --> 01:11:44,992
Listen, l need to make
one thing very clear.

1002
01:11:45,237 --> 01:11:49,753
Our organization will not be placated
with flowery New Age rhetoric...

1003
01:11:50,437 --> 01:11:51,233
Mr. President!

1004
01:11:53,717 --> 01:11:55,708
<i>The President</i>
<i>met with top advisors...</i>

1005
01:11:55,917 --> 01:11:59,068
<i>...regarding the latest efforts</i>
<i>to decode the message.</i>

1006
01:11:59,317 --> 01:12:03,708
<i>While there has been some progress,</i>
<i>the official line remains cautious.</i>

1007
01:12:03,917 --> 01:12:05,908
<i>If you're asking</i>
<i>when we'll find out...</i>

1008
01:12:06,157 --> 01:12:08,387
<i>... what the purpose</i>
<i>of that Machine is...</i>

1009
01:12:09,357 --> 01:12:11,951
<i>...maybe tomorrow,</i>
<i>maybe next year, maybe never.</i>

1010
01:12:16,197 --> 01:12:20,588
There he is. The man with his finger
on the nation's spiritual pulse.

1011
01:12:21,877 --> 01:12:23,469
lt's so good to see you.

1012
01:12:23,717 --> 01:12:24,752
You too.

1013
01:12:26,357 --> 01:12:30,191
Your discovery, all of this.
lt must be a real vindication.

1014
01:12:30,837 --> 01:12:32,429
l'm really happy for you.

1015
01:12:33,077 --> 01:12:34,032
Are you?

1016
01:12:34,197 --> 01:12:36,506
Mr. Joss, the President's waiting.

1017
01:12:39,277 --> 01:12:40,756
The President's waiting.

1018
01:12:44,917 --> 01:12:46,396
See you at the reception?

1019
01:12:46,997 --> 01:12:48,589
Yeah, l wouldn't miss it.

1020
01:13:00,197 --> 01:13:02,392
Miss Constantine,
may l speak to you?

1021
01:13:02,637 --> 01:13:03,956
Certainly.

1022
01:13:05,677 --> 01:13:07,235
l have a big problem.

1023
01:13:09,557 --> 01:13:11,991
Do you know where l can find
a really great dress?

1024
01:13:30,877 --> 01:13:34,711
God created man in the form of
Himself, not in the form of monkeys!

1025
01:13:43,077 --> 01:13:45,386
Get a job!
Don't waste my tax dollars!

1026
01:14:10,797 --> 01:14:12,355
You look beautiful, Ellie.

1027
01:14:13,957 --> 01:14:16,152
-So do you.
-You really do.

1028
01:14:19,717 --> 01:14:21,070
l read your book.

1029
01:14:22,037 --> 01:14:23,186
Here we go.

1030
01:14:23,637 --> 01:14:25,116
You want me to quote you?

1031
01:14:25,797 --> 01:14:27,116
"lronically...

1032
01:14:27,357 --> 01:14:29,268
...the thing people are
most hungry for...

1033
01:14:29,477 --> 01:14:30,671
...meaning...

1034
01:14:30,877 --> 01:14:34,028
...is the one thing science
hasn't been able to give them."

1035
01:14:34,237 --> 01:14:35,192
Yeah.

1036
01:14:37,437 --> 01:14:39,348
lt's like you're saying that...

1037
01:14:39,677 --> 01:14:41,872
...science killed God.

1038
01:14:42,237 --> 01:14:44,956
What if science simply revealed...

1039
01:14:45,517 --> 01:14:47,872
...that He never existed
in the first place?

1040
01:14:51,197 --> 01:14:53,267
l think we need to get some air.

1041
01:14:54,237 --> 01:14:55,989
And a few more of these.

1042
01:14:57,477 --> 01:14:58,592
Thank you.

1043
01:15:00,477 --> 01:15:01,956
A little chilly out here.

1044
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:03,596
Yeah, this is nice.

1045
01:15:03,877 --> 01:15:05,026
l got one for you.

1046
01:15:05,237 --> 01:15:06,829
Occam's Razor. Ever heard of it?

1047
01:15:07,037 --> 01:15:09,597
Hoccam's Razor.
Sounds like some slasher movie.

1048
01:15:09,797 --> 01:15:13,346
No, Occam's Razor is a basic
scientific principle which says:

1049
01:15:13,597 --> 01:15:16,794
Things being equal, the simplest
explanation tends to be right.

1050
01:15:17,117 --> 01:15:18,232
Makes sense to me.

1051
01:15:18,717 --> 01:15:19,786
So what's more likely?

1052
01:15:20,037 --> 01:15:20,992
Thank you.

1053
01:15:21,557 --> 01:15:24,071
An all-powerful God
created the universe...

1054
01:15:24,277 --> 01:15:27,110
...then decided not to give
any proof of His existence?

1055
01:15:27,317 --> 01:15:28,352
Or...

1056
01:15:28,637 --> 01:15:31,709
...that He doesn't exist at all
and that we created Him...

1057
01:15:31,957 --> 01:15:34,391
...so we wouldn't feel
so small and alone.

1058
01:15:35,277 --> 01:15:36,392
l don't know.

1059
01:15:36,597 --> 01:15:40,431
l couldn't imagine living in a world
where God didn't exist.

1060
01:15:41,237 --> 01:15:42,670
l wouldn't want to.

1061
01:15:43,317 --> 01:15:45,547
How do you know
you're not deluding yourself?

1062
01:15:46,357 --> 01:15:47,472
l mean, for me...

1063
01:15:47,637 --> 01:15:49,389
...l'd need proof.

1064
01:15:50,357 --> 01:15:51,312
Proof?

1065
01:15:54,397 --> 01:15:55,989
Did you love your father?

1066
01:15:57,077 --> 01:15:58,669
Your dad, did you love him?

1067
01:15:59,797 --> 01:16:01,867
Yes. Very much.

1068
01:16:05,237 --> 01:16:06,352
Prove it.

1069
01:16:13,157 --> 01:16:14,192
Kent.

1070
01:16:14,877 --> 01:16:16,276
The White House.

1071
01:16:19,157 --> 01:16:22,991
No excuses. Whoever's responsible,
l want their head on a platter.

1072
01:16:23,357 --> 01:16:24,506
What happened?

1073
01:16:25,077 --> 01:16:26,510
You were right all along.

1074
01:16:26,837 --> 01:16:29,510
<i>The team at the VLA</i>
<i>has worked around the clock...</i>

1075
01:16:29,717 --> 01:16:32,106
<i>...and the hard work</i>
<i>has finally paid off.</i>

1076
01:16:32,637 --> 01:16:36,266
<i>This key section uncovered tonight,</i>
<i>and obtained exclusively by CNN...</i>

1077
01:16:36,437 --> 01:16:38,905
<i>...shows an illustration</i>
<i>of a human figure...</i>

1078
01:16:39,157 --> 01:16:41,876
<i>...inside a geometric structure</i>
<i>of some kind.</i>

1079
01:16:42,037 --> 01:16:43,789
<i>This and other contextual clues...</i>

1080
01:16:44,117 --> 01:16:46,915
<i>...now lead scientists to believe</i>
<i>the message is, in fact...</i>

1081
01:16:47,157 --> 01:16:48,875
President called
an emergency meeting.

1082
01:16:49,037 --> 01:16:50,550
l imagined he would.

1083
01:16:50,717 --> 01:16:53,709
<i>...designed to take a single human</i>
<i>occupant into space...</i>

1084
01:16:54,117 --> 01:16:56,312
<i>...presumably to the star Vega.</i>

1085
01:17:19,037 --> 01:17:20,106
Tell me.

1086
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:21,712
They will build it.

1087
01:17:21,917 --> 01:17:22,667
Who goes?

1088
01:17:22,917 --> 01:17:26,227
The President's gone international
to spread the risk and cost...

1089
01:17:26,437 --> 01:17:27,313
Who goes?

1090
01:17:28,077 --> 01:17:29,669
Well, it's complicated.

1091
01:17:30,997 --> 01:17:34,353
They have formed
a group of international candidates.

1092
01:17:34,517 --> 01:17:36,428
Now, it's your discovery.

1093
01:17:36,917 --> 01:17:40,432
They understand that. You're
at the top of a very short list.

1094
01:17:40,757 --> 01:17:43,225
But they're also forming
a selection committee.

1095
01:17:43,437 --> 01:17:47,430
lt's made of scholars, theologians,
scientists, philosophers...

1096
01:17:47,637 --> 01:17:48,592
You're on it.

1097
01:17:49,757 --> 01:17:50,906
l've been asked, yes.

1098
01:17:53,717 --> 01:17:55,309
l guess that means...

1099
01:17:55,917 --> 01:17:58,636
...that you're a selector,
l'm a selectee and we can't...

1100
01:17:58,837 --> 01:17:59,906
Yeah.

1101
01:18:00,117 --> 01:18:02,347
What you don't understand,
Ellie, is...

1102
01:18:02,637 --> 01:18:03,786
l understand.

1103
01:18:05,237 --> 01:18:09,071
l want you to know, whatever
happens, as far as l'm concerned...

1104
01:18:12,557 --> 01:18:13,751
Good luck.

1105
01:18:17,877 --> 01:18:21,233
Whatever you do, make sure
he doesn't monopolize the committee.

1106
01:18:21,557 --> 01:18:23,468
He is not on the committee, Ellie.

1107
01:18:27,317 --> 01:18:30,195
He just resigned.
He wants to be the one to go.

1108
01:18:32,237 --> 01:18:35,388
<i>The President is already feeling</i>
<i>the financial pinch.</i>

1109
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:38,669
<i>Sources say the cost of the project</i>
<i>is spiraling...</i>

1110
01:18:38,837 --> 01:18:41,510
<i>...to more than a third</i>
<i>of a trillion dollars...</i>

1111
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:44,914
<i>...making this perhaps</i>
<i>the most expensive single project...</i>

1112
01:18:45,077 --> 01:18:46,908
<i>...in all of human history.</i>

1113
01:18:47,183 --> 01:18:49,060
<i>Months of debate finally reached...</i>

1114
01:18:49,303 --> 01:18:53,581
<i>...a conclusion last week as 10</i>
<i>candidates were selected by the I.M.C...</i>

1115
01:18:53,943 --> 01:18:57,458
<i>...representing a cross section</i>
<i>of political and religious views.</i>

1116
01:18:57,663 --> 01:19:00,177
<i>Many are the same experts</i>
<i>who have consulted...</i>

1117
01:19:00,383 --> 01:19:02,578
<i>...on the Machine's design</i>
<i>and function.</i>

1118
01:19:02,783 --> 01:19:06,822
<i>They will actively participate on</i>-<i>site,</i>
<i>during the construction process.</i>

1119
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:10,255
<i>The choice of these 10 candidates</i>
<i>has been controversial.</i>

1120
01:19:10,503 --> 01:19:13,142
<i>One</i>-<i>third of the candidates</i>
<i>are American.</i>

1121
01:19:13,383 --> 01:19:16,022
<i>And many</i>
<i>international observers ask why.</i>

1122
01:19:16,503 --> 01:19:19,063
<i>The U.S. is shouldering</i>
<i>a large part of the cost</i>...

1123
01:19:19,223 --> 01:19:22,101
<i>Isn't it true that contractors,</i>
<i>like Hadden Industries...</i>

1124
01:19:22,263 --> 01:19:25,460
<i>...are making contributions</i>
<i>in exchange for technology rights?</i>

1125
01:19:25,623 --> 01:19:29,013
<i>Different nations are being</i>
<i>compensated in different ways.</i>

1126
01:19:29,263 --> 01:19:33,620
<i>Japan made headlines by opting</i>
<i>to forego candidate representation...</i>

1127
01:19:33,903 --> 01:19:36,815
<i>...in exchange for the</i>
<i>systems integration subcontract.</i>

1128
01:19:37,103 --> 01:19:38,741
<i>On what basis do you choose...</i>

1129
01:19:38,903 --> 01:19:41,701
<i>...a human being</i>
<i>to represent humanity?</i>

1130
01:19:41,903 --> 01:19:43,018
<i>Good question, Larry.</i>

1131
01:19:43,223 --> 01:19:44,815
<i>If nothing else...</i>

1132
01:19:45,263 --> 01:19:49,097
<i>...it should be somebody fluent in the</i>
<i>language the message was given in.</i>

1133
01:19:49,263 --> 01:19:50,412
<i>Science, in this case.</i>

1134
01:19:51,023 --> 01:19:53,298
<i>Despite your obvious enthusiasm...</i>

1135
01:19:53,503 --> 01:19:55,698
<i>...there's been</i>
<i>a lot of criticism...</i>

1136
01:19:55,863 --> 01:19:58,423
<i>...that this endeavor</i>
<i>is simply too dangerous.</i>

1137
01:19:58,583 --> 01:20:00,938
<i>Some of that criticism</i>
<i>from scientists.</i>

1138
01:20:01,143 --> 01:20:03,816
<i>One Nobel Prize winner noted,</i>
<i>his words:</i>

1139
01:20:04,543 --> 01:20:06,261
<i>"There is every indication...</i>

1140
01:20:06,423 --> 01:20:10,098
<i>...that this is beyond our capabilities,</i>
<i>that this endeavor will fail...</i>

1141
01:20:10,263 --> 01:20:13,619
<i>...and that the Machine's occupant</i>
<i>will pay for it with his life. "</i>

1142
01:20:13,823 --> 01:20:15,495
<i>How do you respond?</i>

1143
01:20:15,743 --> 01:20:18,894
<i>This message is from a civilization</i>
<i>that may be anywhere...</i>

1144
01:20:19,103 --> 01:20:22,698
<i>...from hundreds to millions</i>
<i>and millions of years ahead of us.</i>

1145
01:20:22,903 --> 01:20:25,940
<i>I have to believe that</i>
<i>an intelligence that advanced...</i>

1146
01:20:26,583 --> 01:20:28,221
<i>...knows what they're doing.</i>

1147
01:20:29,583 --> 01:20:32,780
<i>Now all it requires</i>
<i>on our part is...</i>

1148
01:20:33,383 --> 01:20:34,338
<i>Faith?</i>

1149
01:20:37,303 --> 01:20:39,294
<i>I was going to say,</i>
<i>a sense of adventure.</i>

1150
01:20:39,503 --> 01:20:40,856
<i>And in breaking news...</i>

1151
01:20:41,183 --> 01:20:42,411
<i>...astronaut John Russell...</i>

1152
01:20:42,663 --> 01:20:46,372
<i>...considered to be the leading American</i>
<i>candidate for the Machine seat...</i>

1153
01:20:46,583 --> 01:20:48,733
<i>...has dropped out of the running.</i>

1154
01:20:49,143 --> 01:20:52,055
<i>Russell met with reporters today</i>
<i>at his Houston home.</i>

1155
01:20:52,463 --> 01:20:54,419
<i>I told my dad I didn't want him...</i>

1156
01:20:55,223 --> 01:20:56,178
<i>...to go.</i>

1157
01:20:56,383 --> 01:20:57,816
<i>Daddy, don't go.</i>

1158
01:21:00,623 --> 01:21:02,261
<i>Nothing would give me more pride...</i>

1159
01:21:02,463 --> 01:21:03,532
<i>...than to...</i>

<i>...represent my country.</i>

1161
01:21:06,423 --> 01:21:08,061
<i>But what can I say to this?</i>

1162
01:21:08,983 --> 01:21:12,578
<i>Consortium officials had no comment,</i>
<i>but inside sources...</i>

1163
01:21:12,783 --> 01:21:14,660
<i>...have disclosed</i>

1164

<i>...appears to now be the</i>
<i>front</i>-<i>runner for the Machine seat.</i>

1165
01:21:19,743 --> 01:21:22,098
"Meet me at noon.
Must talk."

1166
01:21:22,383 --> 01:21:24,499
l didn't expect a message
like this from you.

1167
01:21:24,703 --> 01:21:25,977
Thanks for coming.

1168
01:21:26,223 --> 01:21:29,021
ls this kosher?
Fraternizing with the enemy?

1169
01:21:29,223 --> 01:21:32,260
Selectors and selectees
mingling around?

1170
01:21:32,783 --> 01:21:34,501
Can we talk about Einstein?

1171
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:36,536
Yeah, sure.

1172
01:21:37,183 --> 01:21:40,334
Special relativity.
This Machine...

1173
01:21:41,783 --> 01:21:45,696
...if it works, and you travel
to Vega at the speed of light...

1174
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:47,979
-...when you come back...
-lf you come back.

1175
01:21:50,223 --> 01:21:51,861
lf you come back...

1176
01:21:52,303 --> 01:21:56,421
...you'll be 4 years older, but over 50
years will have passed here on Earth.

1177
01:21:56,583 --> 01:21:57,902
Basically.

1178
01:21:58,703 --> 01:22:01,058
And everybody that you care about...

1179
01:22:01,983 --> 01:22:04,292
...will be gone, dead and buried.

1180
01:22:05,103 --> 01:22:08,539
lf you came back,
if you survived at all...

1181
01:22:10,143 --> 01:22:13,818
Look, Palmer, nobody's saying
this isn't dangerous.

1182
01:22:13,983 --> 01:22:17,942
The rest of the candidates and myself
understand the risks we're taking.

1183
01:22:18,143 --> 01:22:19,098
Why?

1184
01:22:19,383 --> 01:22:21,943
lt's a historic opportunity.
The world needs...

1185
01:22:22,143 --> 01:22:24,703
You, Ellie. You!
You personally.

1186
01:22:25,663 --> 01:22:28,336
By doing this,
you're willing to give your life.

1187
01:22:28,543 --> 01:22:30,613
You're willing to die for it.

1188
01:22:32,383 --> 01:22:33,577
Why?

1189
01:22:37,183 --> 01:22:40,812
From as long as l can remember,
l've been searching for...

1190
01:22:41,343 --> 01:22:42,981
...something...

1191
01:22:43,183 --> 01:22:46,778
...some reason why we're here.
What are we doing here? Who are we?

1192
01:22:47,743 --> 01:22:51,497
lf this is a chance to find out
even a part of that answer...

1193
01:22:52,943 --> 01:22:55,821
l don't know,
l think it's worth a human life.

1194
01:22:56,463 --> 01:22:57,578
Don't you?

1195
01:23:04,183 --> 01:23:06,743
You're an incredibly brave woman,
Ellie.

1196
01:23:09,343 --> 01:23:11,174
Or incredibly nuts.

1197
01:23:39,663 --> 01:23:41,415
l'm really confused.

1198
01:23:42,743 --> 01:23:43,971
So am l.

1199
01:23:45,103 --> 01:23:48,573
l think l speak for us all
when l thank you for your patience.

1200
01:23:48,823 --> 01:23:52,054
Myself, l have one
final question, Dr. Arroway.

1201
01:23:53,583 --> 01:23:55,778
lf you should meet these Vegans...

1202
01:23:55,983 --> 01:24:00,056
...and were permitted only
one question to ask of them...

1203
01:24:00,223 --> 01:24:01,815
...what would it be?

1204
01:24:03,383 --> 01:24:05,180
l suppose it would be:

1205
01:24:05,343 --> 01:24:06,935
"How did you do it?

1206
01:24:07,503 --> 01:24:11,735
How did you evolve? How did you
survive technological adolescence...

1207
01:24:11,943 --> 01:24:13,854
...without destroying yourself?"

1208
01:24:14,463 --> 01:24:19,173
<i>That more than any other question is</i>
<i>one I personally would like answered.</i>

1209
01:24:19,543 --> 01:24:21,261
Not too bad, Mike.

1210
01:24:21,903 --> 01:24:23,131
<i>I join Dr. Bergeron...</i>

1211
01:24:23,383 --> 01:24:26,580
...in expressing thanks for
your patience, Dr. Arroway.

1212
01:24:26,783 --> 01:24:29,251
We're all impressed
with your candor...

1213
01:24:29,583 --> 01:24:31,062
...and your stamina.

1214
01:24:31,503 --> 01:24:34,700
l think we're ready to move on
to your final statement.

1215
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:36,655
l have one more question.

1216
01:24:36,903 --> 01:24:38,382
Yes, Mr. Joss.

1217
01:24:42,223 --> 01:24:44,498
Would you consider yourself...

1218
01:24:44,943 --> 01:24:47,173
...a spiritual person?

1219
01:24:52,383 --> 01:24:54,533
l don't understand
the point of the question.

1220
01:24:55,823 --> 01:24:58,462
l consider myself a moral person.

1221
01:24:58,703 --> 01:25:03,094
We're sure that's the case, but what
Mr. Joss is in fact asking...

1222
01:25:03,263 --> 01:25:05,015
Do you believe in God?

1223
01:25:13,183 --> 01:25:15,299
As a scientist...

1224
01:25:15,663 --> 01:25:18,939
...l rely on empirical evidence,
and in this matter...

1225
01:25:19,263 --> 01:25:22,460
...l don't believe
that there's data either way.

1226
01:25:23,263 --> 01:25:27,097
So your answer would in fact be
that you don't believe in God.

1227
01:25:30,783 --> 01:25:33,741
l don't understand the relevance
of the question.

1228
01:25:36,543 --> 01:25:39,455
95%of the world's population...

1229
01:25:39,663 --> 01:25:43,258
...believes in a Supreme Being
in one form or another.

1230
01:25:44,383 --> 01:25:47,500
l believe that makes the question
more than relevant.

1231
01:26:01,303 --> 01:26:02,782
l believe...

1232
01:26:06,943 --> 01:26:09,411
l believe l've already
answered that question.

1233
01:26:13,263 --> 01:26:16,539
<i>I'm proud of what</i>
<i>we've achieved as a species...</i>

1234
01:26:16,823 --> 01:26:18,734
<i>...and as a civilization.</i>

1235
01:26:20,303 --> 01:26:22,817
<i>I would hate to see</i>
<i>everything we stand for...</i>

1236
01:26:23,023 --> 01:26:26,572
<i>...all that we have fought for</i>
<i>for a thousand generations...</i>

1237
01:26:26,783 --> 01:26:29,092
<i>...all that God</i>
<i>has blessed us with...</i>

1238
01:26:30,383 --> 01:26:31,816
...betrayed...

1239
01:26:32,703 --> 01:26:37,174
...in the final hour because we sent a
representative who did not put our...

1240
01:26:37,663 --> 01:26:40,302
<i>...most cherished beliefs first.</i>

1241
01:26:43,423 --> 01:26:44,572
<i>Thank you.</i>

1242
01:27:16,463 --> 01:27:17,737
Why'd you do it?

1243
01:27:22,143 --> 01:27:26,102
Our job was to select someone
to speak for everybody.

1244
01:27:29,343 --> 01:27:32,494
l couldn't in good conscience
vote for a person...

1245
01:27:32,703 --> 01:27:34,659
...who doesn't believe in God.

1246
01:27:36,623 --> 01:27:37,942
Someone who...

1247
01:27:38,423 --> 01:27:41,381
...honestly thinks
the other 95%of us...

1248
01:27:41,583 --> 01:27:44,222
...suffer from some form
of mass delusion.

1249
01:27:47,503 --> 01:27:49,459
l told the truth up there.

1250
01:27:50,743 --> 01:27:54,053
Drumlin told you exactly
what you wanted to hear.

1251
01:28:27,743 --> 01:28:30,257
<i>With full humility</i>
<i>and utmost gratitude...</i>

1252
01:28:30,463 --> 01:28:32,499
<i>...I accept this great honor...</i>

1253
01:28:32,703 --> 01:28:36,616
<i>...and I promise I will do my best</i>
<i>to represent my nation...</i>

1254
01:28:36,823 --> 01:28:40,133
<i>...my planet and my God</i>
<i>on this historic...</i>

1255
01:28:40,303 --> 01:28:41,338
<i>...journey.</i>

1256
01:28:41,823 --> 01:28:44,053
<i>I thank you</i>
<i>from the bottom of my heart.</i>

1257
01:29:24,983 --> 01:29:27,816
<i>There's a carnival atmosphere</i>
<i>at Cape Canaveral...</i>

1258
01:29:27,983 --> 01:29:30,019
<i>...as the International</i>
<i>Machine Consortium...</i>

1259
01:29:30,223 --> 01:29:33,420
<i>...hosts as much a media event</i>
<i>as a systems test.</i>

1260
01:29:33,823 --> 01:29:37,418
<i>David Drumlin is supervising</i>
<i>the on</i>-<i>site portion of the test.</i>

1261
01:29:37,583 --> 01:29:39,380
<i>We spoke with him earlier today.</i>

1262
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:41,255
<i>We'll be able to monitor</i>
<i>the stresses and effects...</i>

1263
01:29:41,463 --> 01:29:44,261
<i>...using the robot passenger...</i>

1264
01:29:44,703 --> 01:29:46,978
<i>... who we lovingly call Elmer.</i>

1265
01:29:52,503 --> 01:29:54,858
The press wants to
ask you a few questions...

1266
01:29:55,063 --> 01:29:57,623
...as soon as they're done
with Dr. Drumlin.

1267
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:01,855
When we release the pod...

1268
01:30:02,223 --> 01:30:04,578
...a substantial amount of energy
will be generated.

1269
01:30:05,303 --> 01:30:07,863
We'll be able to monitor
the stresses and effects...

1270
01:30:08,063 --> 01:30:10,338
...using our robot passenger,
who we...

1271
01:30:10,583 --> 01:30:12,574
...lovingly call Elmer.

1272
01:30:13,143 --> 01:30:14,132
Thank you.

1273
01:30:14,343 --> 01:30:15,537
You're welcome.

1274
01:30:16,943 --> 01:30:19,093
They're ready for you
out at the site.

1275
01:30:19,743 --> 01:30:21,301
Yeah, just a minute.

1276
01:30:27,183 --> 01:30:29,378
-Congratulations.
-Glad you could come.

1277
01:30:30,623 --> 01:30:32,978
Didn't expect to see you here.

1278
01:30:33,703 --> 01:30:35,455
Well, l'm still...

1279
01:30:35,823 --> 01:30:38,337
...Crew Ops at the Control Center.

1280
01:30:38,983 --> 01:30:42,896
l suppose the fact that l discovered
the message means l have PR value.

1281
01:30:43,103 --> 01:30:44,456
Of course.

1282
01:30:46,103 --> 01:30:49,140
l know you must think
this is all very unfair.

1283
01:30:49,703 --> 01:30:51,614
And maybe that's an understatement.

1284
01:30:52,983 --> 01:30:55,213
What you don't know is, l agree.

1285
01:30:55,783 --> 01:30:58,900
l wish the world was a place
where fair was the bottom line...

1286
01:30:59,063 --> 01:31:02,260
...where the idealism you showed
at the hearing was rewarded...

1287
01:31:02,463 --> 01:31:04,499
...not taken advantage of.

1288
01:31:06,183 --> 01:31:08,902
Unfortunately,
we don't live in that world.

1289
01:31:11,143 --> 01:31:12,178
Funny...

1290
01:31:13,583 --> 01:31:16,575
...l always believed the world
is what we make of it.

1291
01:31:18,503 --> 01:31:19,299
Excuse me!

1292
01:31:23,063 --> 01:31:24,576
Good luck on the test.

1293
01:31:25,263 --> 01:31:26,378
Thank you.

1294
01:31:34,583 --> 01:31:35,572
<i>Test director...</i>

1295
01:31:35,783 --> 01:31:37,933
<i>...everything looks good.</i>
<i>Ready to go.</i>

1296
01:31:38,423 --> 01:31:41,335
l want things double
and triple-checked here.

1297
01:31:41,543 --> 01:31:44,615
We only get one shot at this.
Let's get it right.

1298
01:31:45,143 --> 01:31:48,021
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are ready for start-up.

1299
01:31:48,223 --> 01:31:51,420
All controllers, l need a go-no-go
for test initiation.

1300
01:31:51,663 --> 01:31:52,539
-Mechanical?
-Go.

1301
01:31:52,783 --> 01:31:53,693
Electrical?

1302
01:31:53,863 --> 01:31:54,852
Dynamics?

1303
01:31:55,063 --> 01:31:56,212
Communications?

1304
01:31:56,463 --> 01:31:57,532
Pod systems?

1305
01:31:57,703 --> 01:31:58,818
Safety?

1306
01:31:59,263 --> 01:32:01,982
Crew Ops, verify all pre-test
procedures are complete.

1307
01:32:02,263 --> 01:32:03,582
Yes, verified.
l'm go.

1308
01:32:03,783 --> 01:32:06,172
Pad Leader,
is everything okay with you?

1309
01:32:06,343 --> 01:32:08,811
<i>Roger. The pad is a go.</i>

1310
01:32:09,103 --> 01:32:11,697
Test initiation, on my mark.

1311
01:32:12,183 --> 01:32:13,377
5...

1312
01:32:13,743 --> 01:32:14,858

1316
01:32:19,663 --> 01:32:20,732
Mark.

1317
01:32:21,223 --> 01:32:22,941
-Test start.
-Rings are unlocked.

1318
01:32:23,143 --> 01:32:24,656
Power levels show a good start.

1319
01:32:24,823 --> 01:32:26,575
<i>We've begun the test of...</i>

1320
01:32:26,743 --> 01:32:31,134
<i>...earth's first system built by sharing</i>
<i>knowledge with a neighbor in space.</i>

1324
01:32:40,023 --> 01:32:42,981
-Gerry, how are we looking?
-Looks good. We're underway.

1325
01:32:43,143 --> 01:32:44,861
Looks like a normal start-up.

1326
01:32:45,063 --> 01:32:47,338
Roger, David.
lt's looking good here.

1327
01:32:52,663 --> 01:32:55,894
<i>We are moments away from</i>
<i>the initiation of the drop sequence.</i>

1328
01:32:56,143 --> 01:32:57,781
<i>All systems are go.</i>

1329
01:33:00,663 --> 01:33:02,415
-Mechanical, you still happy?
-Roger.

1330
01:33:02,583 --> 01:33:03,857
<i>It's very exciting...</i>

1331
01:33:04,023 --> 01:33:05,581
<i>...from up here.</i>

1332
01:33:07,823 --> 01:33:09,495
We've got 4%.

1333
01:33:09,663 --> 01:33:11,415
<i>We're confirming 4%.</i>

1334
01:33:12,583 --> 01:33:15,177

-Confirmed. We are at 5%.

1338
01:33:24,983 --> 01:33:26,541
David, how's it looking to you?

1339
01:33:26,823 --> 01:33:29,656
<i>Okay. I'm going to take a look</i>
<i>and show you what we got.</i>

1340
01:33:29,823 --> 01:33:31,575
<i>Instrumentation looks good.</i>

1341
01:33:31,743 --> 01:33:35,099
We have a good picture
from Dr. Drumlin's PRD.

1342
01:33:35,623 --> 01:33:37,932
<i>Hope you guys are seeing</i>
<i>what I'm seeing.</i>

<i>All systems are go.</i>

1344
01:33:41,703 --> 01:33:43,216
<i>This is really something!</i>

1345
01:33:43,383 --> 01:33:44,941
<i>For purposes of this test...</i>

1346
01:33:45,143 --> 01:33:49,261
<i>...Dr. Drumlin will be on top of the</i>
<i>Gantry crane that's over the Machine.</i>

1347
01:33:49,463 --> 01:33:51,419
<i>We've got some video animation...</i>

1348
01:33:51,663 --> 01:33:54,939
<i>...to show just how this Machine...</i>
<i>it is thought... will work.</i>

1349
01:33:55,143 --> 01:33:56,735
<i>The passenger pod will release.</i>

1350
01:33:56,943 --> 01:33:59,173
<i>It will come down</i>
<i>through the center of the rings...</i>

1351
01:33:59,383 --> 01:34:01,135
<i>...and into the Machine's core.</i>

1352
01:34:01,343 --> 01:34:03,538
<i>The question everyone</i>
<i>here is asking is...</i>

1353
01:34:03,783 --> 01:34:05,216
<i>... what happens then?</i>

1354
01:34:05,423 --> 01:34:06,981
<i>Some believe the rings function...</i>

1355
01:34:07,183 --> 01:34:10,016
<i>...as some sort of an accelerator</i>
<i>or something...</i>

1356
01:34:10,743 --> 01:34:12,813
<i>...sending its energy</i>
<i>into the pod...</i>

1357
01:34:12,983 --> 01:34:15,372
<i>...making it rocket away</i>
<i>at near light speed.</i>

1358
01:34:15,583 --> 01:34:19,895
<i>Others believe it might open up</i>
<i>a doorway to some other dimension.</i>

1359
01:34:20,183 --> 01:34:21,138
<i>Who's right?</i>

1360
01:34:21,423 --> 01:34:23,698
<i>That's what</i>
<i>today's test is all about.</i>

1361
01:34:24,143 --> 01:34:26,213
-35%.
-Subsystems ready?

1362
01:34:26,423 --> 01:34:28,254
40%normal acceleration.

1363
01:34:28,423 --> 01:34:29,697
<i>Confirm 40%.</i>

1365
01:34:32,983 --> 01:34:34,416
...on my mark.

01:34:34,623 --> 01:34:36,693
<i>All systems ready for drop sequence.</i>

1367
01:34:36,983 --> 01:34:38,462
45%.

1368
01:34:39,343 --> 01:34:41,413
<i>We're in 45%.</i>

1369
01:34:42,303 --> 01:34:44,294
<i>Verify closure.</i>

1370
01:34:45,543 --> 01:34:46,771
46.

1371
01:34:47,183 --> 01:34:51,654
All controllers stand by to initiate
lPV drop sequence. On my mark.

1372
01:34:52,303 --> 01:34:53,622
48%.

1373
01:34:54,823 --> 01:34:56,893
<i>I'm feeling</i>
<i>a very strange vibration.</i>

1374
01:34:57,343 --> 01:35:00,255
-<i>Are you feeling it down there?</i>
-Gerry, can you confirm?

1375
01:35:00,823 --> 01:35:02,017
Everything looks good.

1376
01:35:02,743 --> 01:35:03,619
Crew Ops?

1377
01:35:03,863 --> 01:35:04,739
Nothing wrong.

1378
01:35:04,903 --> 01:35:06,461
We see nothing abnormal here.

1379
01:35:06,663 --> 01:35:09,382
<i>No good. Hold sequence.</i>
<i>I'll take a direct reading.</i>

1380
01:35:09,823 --> 01:35:11,176
What's he talking about?

1381
01:35:11,423 --> 01:35:12,981
Can anyone say grandstanding?

1382
01:35:13,303 --> 01:35:15,214
He sure knows he's on TV!

1383
01:35:15,423 --> 01:35:18,256
Back home that's what we call
an overcooked ham.

1384
01:35:18,623 --> 01:35:20,693
<i>I'm reading 10 kilohertz!</i>

1385
01:35:21,063 --> 01:35:23,736
<i>What do you read on the first</i>
<i>and second order G</i>-<i>levels?</i>

1386
01:35:23,943 --> 01:35:25,501
G-levels are right on!

1387
01:35:27,263 --> 01:35:30,061
<i>We confirm Drumlin's readings.</i>
<i>All normal. We're go.</i>

1388
01:35:31,263 --> 01:35:33,823
l think we're okay,
but we'll let him finish.

1389
01:35:35,103 --> 01:35:38,334
-Mechanical, you still okay?
-Roger. Right on the money.

1390
01:35:38,743 --> 01:35:39,892
Security problem!

1391
01:35:41,223 --> 01:35:42,781
Ellie, are you sure?

1392
01:35:43,423 --> 01:35:44,981
He shouldn't be there.
l know him.

1393
01:35:45,183 --> 01:35:47,856
Gerry, execute the
rapid shutdown sequence.

1394
01:35:48,103 --> 01:35:51,140
Security, move emergency
response team into position.

1395
01:35:51,383 --> 01:35:53,135
Get Drumlin on a secure loop.

1396
01:35:53,383 --> 01:35:54,702
You got him.

1397
01:35:54,943 --> 01:35:57,298
-Can you hear me?
-<i>Yes, I hear.</i>

1398
01:35:57,703 --> 01:35:59,739
We've got a security breach here.

1399
01:36:00,103 --> 01:36:01,058
Behind you.

1400
01:36:01,303 --> 01:36:02,133
The tall guy.

1401
01:36:02,543 --> 01:36:03,817
The technician.

1402
01:36:04,183 --> 01:36:05,218
See him?

1403
01:36:07,583 --> 01:36:08,777
He shouldn't be there.

1404
01:36:14,623 --> 01:36:16,022
Something's in his hand!

1405
01:36:17,103 --> 01:36:19,856
<i>Him! Take him!</i>
<i>Security breach!</i>

1406
01:36:20,143 --> 01:36:20,939
A bomb!

1407
01:36:21,223 --> 01:36:24,454
l want that emergency response team
up on the gantry. Now!

1408
01:36:24,783 --> 01:36:25,693
Stage One Alert!

1409
01:36:25,903 --> 01:36:28,542
Move all fire and rescue personnel
into position one.

1410
01:37:05,263 --> 01:37:07,299
All right, back to your stations.

1411
01:37:07,543 --> 01:37:10,501
l need you to be professional.
Settle down!

1412
01:37:10,663 --> 01:37:13,018
Pad Leader, do you copy?

1413
01:37:30,223 --> 01:37:32,691
<i>The scene earlier today,</i>
<i>when David Drumlin...</i>

1414
01:37:32,863 --> 01:37:34,694
<i>...advisor to two Presidents...</i>

<i>In a related story...</i>

1418
01:37:47,943 --> 01:37:49,171
Can l help you?

1419
01:37:51,103 --> 01:37:52,980
l've got some mail for you.

1420
01:37:53,343 --> 01:37:57,734
<i>...the apparent suicide note of the</i>
<i>terrorist now believed responsible...</i>

1421

<i>...for the explosion</i>

1422
01:38:01,023 --> 01:38:02,581
<i>What we do...</i>

1423
01:38:02,863 --> 01:38:05,661
<i>... we do for the goodness</i>

1424
01:38:06,423 --> 01:38:09,142
<i>This won't be understood,</i>

1425
01:38:09,503 --> 01:38:11,175
<i>...but the Apocalypse to come...</i>

1426
01:38:12,223 --> 01:38:14,293
<i>... will vindicate our faith.</i>

1427
01:38:37,663 --> 01:38:38,459
Welcome home.

1428
01:39:42,463 --> 01:39:43,942
<i>Comrade Arroway...</i>

1429
01:39:44,903 --> 01:39:48,134
<i>... we have been expecting your call.</i>
<i>One moment, please.</i>

1430
01:39:57,503 --> 01:39:58,652
Mr. Hadden?

1431
01:39:59,223 --> 01:40:00,542
<i>Doctor!</i>

1432
01:40:01,583 --> 01:40:03,335
<i>How kind of you to call.</i>

1433
01:40:03,943 --> 01:40:05,854
Mr. Hadden, where are you?

1434
01:40:07,983 --> 01:40:08,972
<i>The Russian government...</i>

1435
01:40:09,143 --> 01:40:12,374
<i>... was kind enough</i>
<i>to give me accommodations on Mir.</i>

1436
01:40:13,343 --> 01:40:15,095
You're living on a space station?

1437
01:40:16,423 --> 01:40:18,334
<i>It's quite simple, really.</i>

1438
01:40:19,743 --> 01:40:23,053
<i>The low oxygen,</i>
<i>zero gravity environment...</i>

1439
01:40:23,263 --> 01:40:27,734
<i>...is the only thing keeping</i>
<i>the cancer from eating me alive.</i>

1440
01:40:29,343 --> 01:40:31,857
<i>Actually, I quite like it up here.</i>

1441
01:40:32,383 --> 01:40:35,420
<i>My little room</i>
<i>has one hell of a view.</i>

1442
01:40:43,223 --> 01:40:44,975
<i>I want to show you something.</i>

1443
01:40:49,503 --> 01:40:51,414
<i>Hokkaido Island.</i>

1444
01:40:52,663 --> 01:40:54,779
The systems integration site.

1445
01:40:55,863 --> 01:40:57,342
<i>Look closer.</i>

1446
01:41:05,343 --> 01:41:08,062
<i>First rule in government spending:</i>

1447
01:41:09,023 --> 01:41:12,698
<i>Why build one when you can have</i>
<i>two at twice the price?</i>

1448
01:41:13,023 --> 01:41:15,901
<i>Only, this one can be kept secret.</i>

1449
01:41:16,543 --> 01:41:18,499
<i>Controlled by Americans...</i>

1450
01:41:18,903 --> 01:41:22,134
<i>...built by Japanese</i>
<i>subcontractors...</i>

1451
01:41:23,023 --> 01:41:25,537
<i>... who also happen to be...</i>

1452
01:41:26,463 --> 01:41:28,055
<i>...recently acquired...</i>

1453
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:30,972
<i>... wholly</i>-<i>owned subsidiaries...</i>

1454
01:41:31,783 --> 01:41:33,694
...of Hadden lndustries.

1455
01:41:37,183 --> 01:41:40,255
<i>They still want</i>
<i>an American to go, Doctor.</i>

1456
01:41:43,863 --> 01:41:45,342
<i>Want to take a ride?</i>

1457
01:42:26,303 --> 01:42:28,214
<i>Augmenting our restraint and...</i>

1458
01:42:28,423 --> 01:42:30,459
...communications console
subsystem...

1459
01:42:30,623 --> 01:42:32,534
...is your personal recording unit.

1460
01:42:32,823 --> 01:42:36,213
Normal,
infrared and ultraviolet lenses.

1461
01:42:36,863 --> 01:42:40,572
Digital microchip good for
thousands of hours of recording.

1462
01:42:41,863 --> 01:42:43,933
Okay, look, l understand...

1463
01:42:44,183 --> 01:42:47,414
...the reason for recording
and documenting the mission.

1464
01:42:47,623 --> 01:42:50,012
But l just want to go on record
one more time.

1465
01:42:50,303 --> 01:42:53,613
The transmitted specs never said
anything about any chair...

1466
01:42:53,823 --> 01:42:55,654
...or a restraining harness...

1467
01:42:55,863 --> 01:42:57,774
...or survival gear.

1468
01:42:58,463 --> 01:43:00,215
Why can't we just trust
the original...

1469
01:43:00,383 --> 01:43:04,217
Doctor, both the lMC Board and
the Sl team reviewed the matter...

1470
01:43:04,383 --> 01:43:07,819
...and concluded that the design
impact is negligible.

1471
01:43:08,183 --> 01:43:09,662
Bottom line is...

1472
01:43:10,143 --> 01:43:12,213
...we're not putting anyone
aboard this Machine...

1473
01:43:12,423 --> 01:43:15,301
...unless there is
some sort of minimal protection.

1474
01:43:15,583 --> 01:43:16,857
End of story.

1475
01:43:23,583 --> 01:43:27,417
We've given these to the astronauts
since the start of the space program.

1476
01:43:28,743 --> 01:43:30,938
lt's never been made public,
of course.

1477
01:43:31,103 --> 01:43:33,139
lt's fast and it's painless.

1478
01:43:35,743 --> 01:43:38,621
l'm going to travel 26 light years
to commit suicide?

1479
01:43:38,903 --> 01:43:40,541
Something may go wrong.

1480
01:43:41,023 --> 01:43:43,583
There may be
an unforeseen mechanical failure.

1481
01:43:44,383 --> 01:43:47,261
You could be marooned,
unable to return.

1482
01:43:48,383 --> 01:43:51,420
There are 1,000 reasons
we can think of to have this...

1483
01:43:51,583 --> 01:43:54,416
...but mostly it's for the reasons
we can't think of.

1484
01:44:19,903 --> 01:44:20,972
Come in.

1485
01:44:22,463 --> 01:44:24,693
Dr. Arroway, time to get ready.

1486
01:44:24,863 --> 01:44:25,818
Thank you.

1487
01:44:36,503 --> 01:44:38,141
l know there's not much time.

1488
01:44:38,303 --> 01:44:41,261
As soon as l found out about it,
l called the President.

1489
01:44:41,463 --> 01:44:43,055
l came with Kitz.

1490
01:44:43,623 --> 01:44:45,818
l had to see you one more time.

1491
01:44:45,983 --> 01:44:47,621
Oh, God, l'm sorry.

1492
01:44:48,023 --> 01:44:49,661
No, l'm glad you came.

1493
01:44:49,943 --> 01:44:52,059
There's something
l got to say to you.

1494
01:44:53,383 --> 01:44:57,456
The reason l didn't vote for you was
a good one, but not the real one.

1495
01:44:58,463 --> 01:45:00,374
l didn't vote for you to go...

1496
01:45:02,183 --> 01:45:03,980
...because l don't want to lose you.

1497
01:45:05,023 --> 01:45:07,093
Now you find your way home,
all right?

1498
01:45:23,423 --> 01:45:24,822
<i>23 hours ago, the world...</i>

1499
01:45:25,023 --> 01:45:28,982
<i>... was stunned by the announcement</i>
<i>of the existence of another Machine...</i>

1500
01:45:29,143 --> 01:45:31,976
<i>...and its passenger,</i>
<i>Eleanor Ann Arroway.</i>

1501
01:45:32,183 --> 01:45:32,740
<i>Now...</i>

1502
01:45:33,343 --> 01:45:35,698
<i>...the question</i>
<i>that's on everyone's mind:</i>

1503
01:45:35,863 --> 01:45:37,535
<i>Will history repeat itself?</i>

1504
01:45:37,943 --> 01:45:40,173
<i>With a piece of engineering</i>
<i>this complex...</i>

1505
01:45:40,383 --> 01:45:44,217
<i>... with so many unknowns,</i>
<i>could the unthinkable occur?</i>

1506
01:45:44,383 --> 01:45:47,580
<i>The security in Hokkaido</i>
<i>has been incredibly tight.</i>

1507
01:45:47,743 --> 01:45:51,019
<i>No reporters whatsoever</i>
<i>have been allowed near the site.</i>

1508
01:48:24,943 --> 01:48:27,821
Restraint secure.
Life support functions normal.

1509
01:48:28,023 --> 01:48:28,853
Roger.

1510
01:48:29,023 --> 01:48:30,979
<i>This is Control.</i>
<i>Do you copy?</i>

1511
01:48:31,263 --> 01:48:32,582
Reading you five-by-five.

1512
01:48:33,623 --> 01:48:35,056
Give me Ellie's PRD.

1513
01:48:35,263 --> 01:48:37,174
<i>Video unit recording</i>
<i>and transmitting.</i>

1514
01:48:38,463 --> 01:48:40,977
-<i>Are you reading me?</i>
-That's affirmative.

1515
01:48:41,143 --> 01:48:42,781
Video looks good.

1516
01:48:43,583 --> 01:48:44,652
<i>Copy, Control.</i>

1517
01:48:45,983 --> 01:48:48,702
Ellie, we're going to proceed
to button you up.

1518
01:48:50,503 --> 01:48:51,572
<i>I'm ready.</i>

1519
01:48:55,303 --> 01:48:57,055
<i>Confirming walkway retraction.</i>

1520
01:48:57,743 --> 01:48:59,096
-Communications?
-Go.

1521
01:48:59,263 --> 01:49:01,174
-Life support?
-Go.

1522
01:49:01,503 --> 01:49:02,856
We are go for closure.

1523
01:49:05,183 --> 01:49:06,821
<i>I'm go here.</i>

1524
01:49:07,823 --> 01:49:11,133
Mechanical, initiate
lPV closure sequence.

1525
01:49:12,703 --> 01:49:14,375
Let me get you a chair.

1526
01:49:16,703 --> 01:49:19,900
-lt's nice to smell you again, Mr. Kitz.
-You too.

1527
01:49:20,583 --> 01:49:22,335
Wouldn't peg him as a Polo man.

1528
01:49:31,343 --> 01:49:32,776
l got a visual on the door.

1529
01:49:35,103 --> 01:49:36,855
The door is looking good.

1530
01:49:41,903 --> 01:49:43,495
Door alignment looks good.

1531
01:50:11,543 --> 01:50:12,976
We're green across the board.

1532
01:50:13,183 --> 01:50:15,572
Copy that, Control.
lPV is secure.

1533
01:50:23,103 --> 01:50:24,695
<i>We are at 30%.</i>

1534
01:50:25,183 --> 01:50:26,502
Copy that, 30%.

1535
01:50:31,143 --> 01:50:32,542
How you doing in there?

1536
01:50:33,063 --> 01:50:33,654
<i>Kent?</i>

1537

ls that you?

1538
01:50:35,663 --> 01:50:37,176
<i>That's a big affirmative.</i>

1539
01:50:38,023 --> 01:50:39,456
Who let you in there?

1540
01:50:39,783 --> 01:50:41,694
<i>A higher power intervened.</i>

1541
01:50:43,663 --> 01:50:45,016
l'm glad you came.

1542
01:50:49,503 --> 01:50:50,618
35%.

1543
01:50:51,383 --> 01:50:52,657
Copy that, 35%.

1544
01:50:52,903 --> 01:50:54,302
-Mechanical?
-We're good.

1545
01:50:54,463 --> 01:50:55,782
40%.

1546
01:50:59,143 --> 01:51:01,054
l'm picking up a moderate vibration.

1547
01:51:02,183 --> 01:51:04,139
Dynamics, can you confirm vibration?

1548
01:51:04,343 --> 01:51:05,492
lt looks good here.

1549
01:51:05,743 --> 01:51:08,815
She's feeling the same thing
they felt at the Cape.

1550
01:51:08,983 --> 01:51:10,018
Vibration's normal.

1551
01:51:10,743 --> 01:51:13,018
<i>We are at 50%.</i>
<i>All systems nominal.</i>

1552
01:51:13,303 --> 01:51:15,021
Copy that, 50%.

1553
01:51:20,263 --> 01:51:22,094
Vibration's a little stronger now.

1554
01:51:22,383 --> 01:51:24,578
We're picking up
some low frequency noise.

1555
01:51:25,383 --> 01:51:26,862
Mechanical, confirm?

1556
01:51:27,063 --> 01:51:28,382
lt looks fine to me.

1557
01:51:28,583 --> 01:51:30,653
Roger.
Jerry, what do you think?

1558
01:51:30,863 --> 01:51:31,693
l'm still go.

1559
01:51:31,903 --> 01:51:33,382
People, we are still go.

1560
01:51:36,063 --> 01:51:37,542
Something's happening.

1561
01:51:41,463 --> 01:51:42,816
You see that light?

1562
01:51:43,063 --> 01:51:44,132
<i>I'm seeing</i>...

1563
01:51:47,263 --> 01:51:49,140
l can't tell if it's daylight.

1564
01:51:49,903 --> 01:51:52,292
There it is again.
lt's coming from the bottom.

1565
01:51:53,703 --> 01:51:55,216
Let me show you.
See that?

1566
01:51:55,423 --> 01:51:57,539
Negative.
You're breaking up.

1567
01:51:57,863 --> 01:51:59,933
-Can we boost signal?
-lt's at maximum.

1568
01:52:00,423 --> 01:52:01,651
65%.

1569
01:52:01,823 --> 01:52:03,461
<i>The material is changing.</i>

1570
01:52:03,623 --> 01:52:06,979
lt's bordering on translucence.
The system's intact.

1571
01:52:10,183 --> 01:52:11,662
lt has to be...

1572
01:52:11,903 --> 01:52:14,258
...some kind of
electromagnetic field.

1573
01:52:14,503 --> 01:52:15,538
<i>Do you read this?</i>

1574
01:52:15,783 --> 01:52:17,296
We see only interference.

1575
01:52:17,463 --> 01:52:19,181
<i>It's becoming translucent.</i>

1576
01:52:20,023 --> 01:52:22,457
l can't describe it.
l can't even explain it!

1577
01:52:25,063 --> 01:52:25,973

1578
01:52:26,183 --> 01:52:28,458

We're go for ignition.

We have auxiliary ignition.

1583
01:52:49,423 --> 01:52:50,822
Life support, how is she?

1584
01:52:51,023 --> 01:52:53,742
Heart and respiration are high
but within limits.

1585
01:52:54,103 --> 01:52:55,377
Ellie, do you copy?

1586
01:52:55,543 --> 01:52:56,419

-We're within limits, barely.

Barely, but she's there.

Okay to go.

1608
01:54:23,663 --> 01:54:25,016

1609
01:54:27,903 --> 01:54:29,655
Steve, we're real close.

...some kind of a transit system.

01:57:00,103 --> 01:57:01,422

Beautiful!

1668
01:59:32,303 --> 01:59:34,055
So beautiful.

1670
02:02:13,783 --> 02:02:15,011
Hi, Sparks.

1671
02:02:16,823 --> 02:02:17,778
Dad?

1672
02:02:25,463 --> 02:02:26,942
l missed you.

1673
02:02:32,703 --> 02:02:33,658
Aren't you...?

1674
02:02:33,863 --> 02:02:36,616
l'm sorry l couldn't
be there for you, sweetheart.

1675
02:02:46,423 --> 02:02:47,697
You're not real.

1676
02:02:49,623 --> 02:02:50,976
None of this is real!

1677
02:02:51,223 --> 02:02:52,861
That's my scientist.

1678
02:02:54,183 --> 02:02:58,301
When l was unconscious, you
downloaded my thoughts, my memories.

1679
02:02:59,263 --> 02:03:00,537
Pensacola!

1680
02:03:03,703 --> 02:03:06,058
We thought it might
make things easier for you.

1681
02:03:19,303 --> 02:03:20,702
Why did you contact us?

1682
02:03:20,863 --> 02:03:22,455
You contacted us.

1683
02:03:22,983 --> 02:03:24,541
We were just listening.

1684
02:03:25,343 --> 02:03:26,617
There are others?

1685
02:03:26,943 --> 02:03:28,058
Many others.

1686
02:03:32,983 --> 02:03:34,132
They all...

1687
02:03:34,623 --> 02:03:37,660
...travel here through
that transit system you built?

1688
02:03:38,103 --> 02:03:39,582
We didn't build it.

1689
02:03:40,663 --> 02:03:42,142
We don't know who did.

1690
02:03:44,103 --> 02:03:46,617
They were gone
long before we ever got here.

1691
02:03:47,543 --> 02:03:49,295
Maybe someday they'll come back.

1692
02:03:50,263 --> 02:03:52,731
All the civilizations
you find come here?

1693
02:03:52,903 --> 02:03:54,097
Not all.

1694
02:03:55,783 --> 02:03:58,775
-ls this some test?
-No, no test.

1695
02:04:01,663 --> 02:04:03,096
You have your mother's hands.

1696
02:04:12,903 --> 02:04:14,973
You're an interesting species...

1697
02:04:15,583 --> 02:04:17,175
...an interesting mix.

1698
02:04:18,423 --> 02:04:21,017
You're capable
of such beautiful dreams...

1699
02:04:22,023 --> 02:04:24,059
...and such horrible nightmares.

1700
02:04:25,543 --> 02:04:27,295
You feel so lost...

1701
02:04:28,023 --> 02:04:30,457
...so cut off, so alone.

1702
02:04:32,103 --> 02:04:33,331
Only you're not.

1703
02:04:37,663 --> 02:04:39,255
ln all our searching...

1704
02:04:39,423 --> 02:04:42,256
...all we've found
that makes the emptiness bearable...

1705
02:04:42,943 --> 02:04:44,342
...is each other.

1706
02:04:48,103 --> 02:04:49,661
What happens now?

1707
02:04:50,943 --> 02:04:52,012
Now?

1708
02:04:53,343 --> 02:04:54,742
You go home.

1709
02:04:55,263 --> 02:04:56,252
Home?

1710
02:04:56,703 --> 02:04:57,772
But...

1711
02:04:58,303 --> 02:04:59,656
...l have so many questions.

1712
02:05:00,063 --> 02:05:01,621
Do we get to come back?

1713
02:05:02,663 --> 02:05:04,415
This was just a first step.

1714
02:05:05,023 --> 02:05:06,741
ln time, you'll take another.

1715
02:05:08,223 --> 02:05:10,657
But other people need to see
what l've seen...

1716
02:05:10,823 --> 02:05:13,735
This is the way it's been done
for billions of years.

1717
02:05:16,023 --> 02:05:17,615
Small moves, Ellie.

1718
02:05:19,423 --> 02:05:21,015
Small moves.

1719
02:06:02,743 --> 02:06:04,335
We've got video on Ellie!

1720
02:06:04,543 --> 02:06:06,420
She's through!
She is in the net.

1721
02:06:06,583 --> 02:06:08,858
She's alive.
Get the President on the phone!

1722
02:06:09,663 --> 02:06:11,142
What's going on?
How is she?

1723
02:06:11,943 --> 02:06:13,581
Ellie, this is Control.
You copy?

1724
02:06:13,823 --> 02:06:15,176
-What's going on?
-l don't know.

1725
02:06:15,903 --> 02:06:17,416
-She's alive.
-Put her on P.A.

1726
02:06:17,663 --> 02:06:19,096
Ellie, hold on tight.

1727
02:06:19,743 --> 02:06:22,894
We're still trying to determine
the nature of the malfunction...

1728
02:06:23,103 --> 02:06:25,537
...but the important thing
is you're okay.

1729
02:06:25,783 --> 02:06:26,738
<i>What?</i>

1730
02:06:27,063 --> 02:06:28,462
lt's all right.

1731
02:06:28,663 --> 02:06:30,460
The important thing is you're safe.

1732
02:06:31,423 --> 02:06:33,175
<i>What malfunction?</i>

1733
02:06:37,383 --> 02:06:38,657
<i>What happened?</i>

1734
02:06:40,223 --> 02:06:41,702
<i>What day is this?</i>

1735
02:06:42,463 --> 02:06:43,418
l'm sorry.

1736
02:06:43,623 --> 02:06:45,022
Did you say what day?

1737
02:06:46,623 --> 02:06:48,056
<i>How long was I gone?</i>

1738
02:06:50,303 --> 02:06:54,296
The lPV dropped
straight through the Machine.

1739
02:06:55,143 --> 02:06:56,815
You didn't go anywhere.

1740
02:06:57,503 --> 02:06:58,777
But l did.

1741
02:06:59,103 --> 02:07:00,331
l did go.

1742
02:07:00,863 --> 02:07:02,933
That's what l've tried
to tell everyone.

1743
02:07:07,383 --> 02:07:09,817
But the headset
didn't record a single image?

1744
02:07:10,503 --> 02:07:11,731
Just this.

1745
02:07:12,023 --> 02:07:13,012
Static.

1746
02:07:13,183 --> 02:07:14,138
Thank you.

1747
02:07:15,583 --> 02:07:17,221
Let me show you what we saw.

1748
02:07:26,823 --> 02:07:30,293
43 separate remote cameras
show exactly the same event.

1749
02:07:30,623 --> 02:07:33,933
The lPV dropped straight through.
Everyone saw exactly...

1750
02:07:34,263 --> 02:07:35,582
...the same thing.

1751
02:07:35,903 --> 02:07:37,336
Nothing happened.

1752
02:07:38,903 --> 02:07:40,814
How do you explain this, Doctor?

1753
02:07:42,943 --> 02:07:44,092
l can't.

1754
02:07:44,263 --> 02:07:45,662
<i>I'd encourage you...</i>

1755
02:07:47,383 --> 02:07:49,499
<i>...not to inflame this situation...</i>

1756
02:07:49,663 --> 02:07:51,415
<i>...beyond the facts.</i>

1757
02:07:51,583 --> 02:07:54,655
<i>Let us deal with this on the facts.</i>

1758
02:07:54,943 --> 02:07:57,821
<i>We are monitoring</i>
<i>what has actually happened.</i>

1759
02:07:57,983 --> 02:08:00,941
<i>We are taking</i>
<i>what we believe are factually...</i>

1760
02:08:01,143 --> 02:08:03,054
<i>...appropriate steps.</i>

1761
02:08:03,343 --> 02:08:06,301
<i>Amid a flurry of accusations</i>
<i>and counter</i>-<i>accusations...</i>

1762
02:08:06,463 --> 02:08:09,023
<i>...by the nations representing</i>
<i>the Machine Consortium...</i>

1763
02:08:09,223 --> 02:08:11,942
<i>...the President has ordered</i>
<i>a special inquiry.</i>

1764
02:08:12,103 --> 02:08:14,822
<i>But the appointment</i>
<i>to the committee of Michael Kitz...</i>

1765
02:08:14,983 --> 02:08:17,702
<i>... who has resigned</i>
<i>as National Security Advisor...</i>

1766
02:08:17,903 --> 02:08:20,212
<i>...has raised eyebrows</i>
<i>on Capitol Hill.</i>

1767
02:08:20,423 --> 02:08:23,938
<i>I have made no decision to run for</i>
<i>Congress, announced no candidacy.</i>

1768
02:08:24,183 --> 02:08:27,380
<i>I resigned as</i>
<i>National Security Advisor...</i>

1769
02:08:27,583 --> 02:08:31,542
<i>...in order to devote</i>
<i>all of my energy to this inquiry.</i>

1770
02:08:32,263 --> 02:08:36,700
<i>The people of the world have a right</i>
<i>to know what really happened.</i>

1771
02:08:37,503 --> 02:08:40,063
Yet every scientific
instrument confirms...

1772
02:08:40,223 --> 02:08:44,057
...the lPV was out of contact
for only a fraction of a second.

1773
02:08:44,223 --> 02:08:45,975
lsn't that correct, Doctor?

1774
02:08:47,863 --> 02:08:50,093
A fraction of a second Earth time,
yes.

1775
02:08:50,903 --> 02:08:52,222
Earth time?

1776
02:08:52,423 --> 02:08:55,733
Senator, l believe that the Machine
opened up a wormhole...

1777
02:08:56,103 --> 02:09:00,540
...a tunnel through space-time, also
known as an Einstein-Rossen Bridge.

1778
02:09:00,863 --> 02:09:04,856
Due to the effect of general relativity,
what l experienced as 18 hours...

1779
02:09:05,023 --> 02:09:07,218
...passed instantaneously on Earth.

1780
02:09:07,423 --> 02:09:11,382
lsn't it true these wormholes
are merely theoretical predictions?

1781
02:09:11,743 --> 02:09:14,257
There is no evidence
they actually exist?

1782
02:09:14,463 --> 02:09:16,055
There is no direct evidence, no.

1783
02:09:16,383 --> 02:09:17,498
Tell me...

1784
02:09:17,943 --> 02:09:20,776
...why would these aliens
go to all this trouble?

1785
02:09:21,343 --> 02:09:25,222
Bring you thousands of light years,
then send you home without proof?

1786
02:09:25,863 --> 02:09:28,502
They said it's how it's been done
for billions of years.

1787
02:09:29,023 --> 02:09:32,174
<i>You have no proof because</i>
<i>they didn't want you to have any.</i>

1788
02:09:32,543 --> 02:09:34,420
<i>A phenomenon known</i>
<i>in psychiatric circles...</i>

1789
02:09:34,583 --> 02:09:36,858
<i>...as a self</i>-<i>reinforcing delusion.</i>

1790
02:09:37,663 --> 02:09:39,062
<i>You think I was delusional?</i>

1791
02:09:39,303 --> 02:09:43,262
<i>I do think you may have suffered</i>
<i>some kind of an episode. Yes, I do.</i>

1792
02:09:43,423 --> 02:09:46,142
<i>I'd like to propose</i>
<i>an alternate hypothesis...</i>

1793
02:09:46,303 --> 02:09:49,852
<i>...and I'd like you to bring your</i>
<i>scientific expertise to bear on it.</i>

1794
02:09:50,143 --> 02:09:53,021
To fake a signal from Vega...

1795
02:09:53,783 --> 02:09:55,011
...what would you need?

1796
02:09:56,863 --> 02:10:00,492
You'd need a satellite to transmit
it, but it would be impossible to...

1797
02:10:00,703 --> 02:10:04,491
You'd need a satellite
and launch capabilities to orbit it.

1798
02:10:04,663 --> 02:10:07,780
And the message itself. To put
something like this together...

1799
02:10:08,023 --> 02:10:10,218
...so complex,
drawing on many disciplines...

1800
02:10:10,383 --> 02:10:11,657
Would be impossible.

1801
02:10:13,423 --> 02:10:14,902
lmpossible?

1802
02:10:15,343 --> 02:10:18,141
ls there anyone who might
have been up to the challenge?

1803
02:10:19,023 --> 02:10:21,457
Someone with extraordinary
technical expertise...

1804
02:10:21,703 --> 02:10:23,614
...enormous financial resources...

1805
02:10:24,063 --> 02:10:27,976
...someone perverse enough, eccentric
enough to come up with the idea?

1806
02:10:29,623 --> 02:10:30,339
Hadden?

1807
02:10:31,423 --> 02:10:33,334
S. R. Hadden.

1808
02:10:37,663 --> 02:10:39,255
You're implying that this was...

1809
02:10:39,463 --> 02:10:41,931
...some kind of a hoax?
That he engineered this?

1810
02:10:42,103 --> 02:10:43,377
S. R. Hadden...

1811
02:10:43,743 --> 02:10:48,055
<i>...a legendary power broker in</i>
<i>perhaps his final bid for immortality.</i>

1812
02:10:48,383 --> 02:10:50,943
<i>Maybe he wanted to</i>
<i>exploit new technologies...</i>

1813
02:10:51,103 --> 02:10:53,219
<i>...having world governments</i>
<i>pick up the tab.</i>

1814
02:10:53,383 --> 02:10:56,056
<i>Perhaps this was his</i>
<i>final altruistic gesture...</i>

1815
02:10:56,263 --> 02:10:59,733
<i>...to unite the world in some</i>
<i>common goal. Maybe all of the above.</i>

1816
02:11:00,103 --> 02:11:02,139
<i>S. R. Hadden, a brilliant...</i>

1817
02:11:02,783 --> 02:11:04,375
<i>...and complicated man.</i>

1818
02:11:07,103 --> 02:11:10,778
Doctor, are you familiar
with the scientific precept...

1819
02:11:11,423 --> 02:11:13,414
...known as Occam's Razor?

1820
02:11:19,423 --> 02:11:20,492
Yes.

1821
02:11:22,423 --> 02:11:26,939
lt means the simplest explanation
generally tends to be the right one.

1822
02:11:27,103 --> 02:11:28,058
Exactly.

1823
02:11:28,783 --> 02:11:31,172
You tell me.
What is more likely here?

1824
02:11:31,383 --> 02:11:34,614
A message from aliens
results in a magical machine...

1825
02:11:34,783 --> 02:11:37,377
...that whisks you
to the center of the galaxy...

1826
02:11:37,583 --> 02:11:40,302
...to windsurf with Dad
and a split second later...

1827
02:11:40,503 --> 02:11:43,859
...returns you home
without a single shred of proof?

1828
02:11:44,263 --> 02:11:47,573
Or that your experience
is the result of being...

1829
02:11:47,743 --> 02:11:51,053
...the unwitting star in the
farewell performance of one...

1830
02:11:51,223 --> 02:11:52,133
...S.R. Hadden?

1831
02:11:52,343 --> 02:11:55,892
A man with the means and motive
to play you and all of us...

1832
02:11:56,063 --> 02:12:00,215
...as pawns in the most elaborate,
most expensive hoax of all time?

1833
02:12:05,023 --> 02:12:08,538
You come to us with no evidence,
no records...

1834
02:12:09,263 --> 02:12:10,935
...no artifacts...

1835
02:12:11,263 --> 02:12:15,256
...only a story that, to put it
mildly, strains credibility.

1836
02:12:16,503 --> 02:12:19,381
Over half a trillion dollars
were spent.

1837
02:12:19,703 --> 02:12:22,058
Dozens of lives were lost.

1838
02:12:23,103 --> 02:12:27,301
Are you going to sit there and tell
us we should just take this all...

1839
02:12:28,343 --> 02:12:29,696
...on faith?

1840
02:12:33,583 --> 02:12:35,494
Please answer the question, Doctor.

1841
02:12:39,223 --> 02:12:41,293
ls it possible
that it didn't happen?

1842
02:12:41,543 --> 02:12:42,612
Yes.

1843
02:12:45,343 --> 02:12:48,380
As a scientist l must concede that.
l must volunteer that.

1844
02:12:52,663 --> 02:12:53,982
Let me get this straight.

1845
02:12:54,303 --> 02:12:58,137
You admit you have no physical
evidence to back up your story?

1846
02:12:58,703 --> 02:12:59,499
Yes.

1847
02:12:59,743 --> 02:13:02,655
You admit you may have
hallucinated this whole thing?

1848
02:13:03,543 --> 02:13:05,773
You admit if you were
in our position...

1849
02:13:05,943 --> 02:13:09,333
...you would be as incredulous
and skeptical as we?

1850
02:13:10,783 --> 02:13:14,617
Then why don't you simply withdraw
your testimony and concede...

1851
02:13:14,903 --> 02:13:18,816
...that this journey to the center
of the galaxy never took place?

1852
02:13:21,663 --> 02:13:23,415
Because l can't.

1853
02:13:30,103 --> 02:13:32,697
l had an experience.

1854
02:13:34,943 --> 02:13:37,503
l can't prove it.
l can't even explain it.

1855
02:13:37,663 --> 02:13:40,541
But everything l know as
a human being, everything l am...

1856
02:13:40,703 --> 02:13:42,773
...tells me it was real.

1857
02:13:45,143 --> 02:13:48,453
l was given something wonderful,
something that changed me forever.

1858
02:13:48,783 --> 02:13:49,818
A vision...

1859
02:13:50,343 --> 02:13:51,901
...of the universe...

1860
02:13:52,623 --> 02:13:54,693
...that tells us undeniably...

1861
02:13:55,143 --> 02:13:57,418
...how tiny and insignificant...

1862
02:13:57,583 --> 02:14:00,973
...and how rare and precious
we all are.

1863
02:14:02,103 --> 02:14:05,095
A vision that tells us
that we belong to something...

1864
02:14:05,343 --> 02:14:09,780
...that is greater than ourselves,
that none of us are alone.

1865
02:14:14,503 --> 02:14:17,381
l wish l could share that.

1866
02:14:20,783 --> 02:14:21,852
l wish...

1867
02:14:23,423 --> 02:14:25,778
...that everyone, if even for one...

1868
02:14:26,103 --> 02:14:27,252
...moment...

1869
02:14:27,503 --> 02:14:28,731
...could feel...

1870
02:14:29,183 --> 02:14:32,061
...that awe and humility and hope.

1871
02:14:41,063 --> 02:14:43,213
That continues to be my wish.

1872
02:15:22,743 --> 02:15:25,257
Dr. Arroway,
can l get a picture, please.

1873
02:16:05,583 --> 02:16:06,652
Reverend Joss!

1874
02:16:06,863 --> 02:16:08,421
What do you believe?!

1875
02:16:14,063 --> 02:16:17,897
As a person of faith, l'm bound by a
different covenant than Dr. Arroway.

1876
02:16:19,663 --> 02:16:21,733
But our goal is one and the same.

1877
02:16:22,223 --> 02:16:23,815
The pursuit of truth.

1878
02:16:27,223 --> 02:16:28,451
l, for one, believe her.

1879
02:16:51,023 --> 02:16:53,856
<i>So what happens now?</i>
<i>We give her a medal?</i>

1880
02:16:54,263 --> 02:16:56,572
l'd say at least a healthy grant.

1881
02:16:56,943 --> 02:17:00,219
You read the confidential report
from the investigating committee?

1882
02:17:00,423 --> 02:17:01,776
<i>I flipped through it.</i>

1883
02:17:02,223 --> 02:17:06,341
l was very interested in the section
on Arroway's video unit.

1884
02:17:07,023 --> 02:17:09,253
The one that recorded the static.

1885
02:17:10,543 --> 02:17:11,771
<i>Continue.</i>

1886
02:17:12,743 --> 02:17:15,974
The fact that it recorded static
isn't what interests me.

1887
02:17:21,103 --> 02:17:22,331
<i>Continue.</i>

1888
02:17:23,183 --> 02:17:24,980
What interests me...

1889
02:17:25,263 --> 02:17:28,812
...is that it recorded
approximately 18 hours of it.

1890
02:17:33,863 --> 02:17:35,660
<i>That is interesting, isn't it?</i>

1891
02:17:42,103 --> 02:17:45,891
And you can see over there,
we're building 45 brand new dishes.

1892
02:17:46,143 --> 02:17:49,818
That means when you put them together
with all the radio telescopes...

1893
02:17:50,023 --> 02:17:51,342
...all over the world...

1894
02:17:51,543 --> 02:17:55,741
...we'll hear farther into space
than anyone has ever heard before.

1895
02:17:57,223 --> 02:18:00,021
Are there other people
out there in the universe?

1896
02:18:00,943 --> 02:18:02,296
That's a good question.

1897
02:18:02,543 --> 02:18:03,612
What do you think?

1898
02:18:04,223 --> 02:18:05,178
l don't know.

1899
02:18:05,623 --> 02:18:07,102
That's a good answer.

1900
02:18:08,303 --> 02:18:09,258
Skeptic, huh?

1901
02:18:10,503 --> 02:18:14,860
The important thing is that you all
keep searching for your own answers.

1902
02:18:15,343 --> 02:18:17,299
One thing about the universe,
though.

1903
02:18:18,223 --> 02:18:19,338
The universe...

1904
02:18:19,823 --> 02:18:21,893
...is a pretty big place.

1905
02:18:22,863 --> 02:18:25,093
lt's bigger than anything...

1906
02:18:25,463 --> 02:18:28,182
...anyone has ever
dreamed of before.

1907
02:18:29,703 --> 02:18:31,341
So if it's just us...

1908
02:18:33,103 --> 02:18:35,173
...it seems like
an awful waste of space.

1909
02:18:36,983 --> 02:18:37,938
Right?
