1
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:01,363
It's important you understand.

2
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:04,482
It's not you, it's me.

3
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,828
What we have is so special.

4
00:01:11,025 --> 00:01:13,676
I love you more than I can say,

5
00:01:14,267 --> 00:01:16,995
but I'm sorry, truly,

6
00:01:17,095 --> 00:01:19,827
because... I fucked up.

7
00:01:21,483 --> 00:01:22,539
Look...

8
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:26,977
I owe you an explanation, but honestly,
I don't know where to begin.

9
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,097
Well...

10
00:01:33,197 --> 00:01:36,344
maybe there, at the beginning.

11
00:01:36,644 --> 00:01:40,635
<i>You see, I grew up above a great party.</i>

12
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:59,243
- Gordon!
- Mommy?

13
00:01:59,343 --> 00:02:02,025
- She's in the kitchen.
- What are you doing?

14
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:05,347
I'm waiting for your mother to bring out
the hors d'oeuvres. Now bugger off.

15
00:02:07,696 --> 00:02:11,050
<i>After school, I used to love
to listen to my father lecture.</i>

16
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,016
Now the faculty would have me
teach you it was Wordsworth,

17
00:02:15,116 --> 00:02:16,712
Keats, and Coleridge,

18
00:02:16,812 --> 00:02:21,704
who in writing about love,
defined the Romantic age.

19
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,273
And they've told me to ignore Byron.

20
00:02:26,883 --> 00:02:30,350
Mad, bad, and dangerous to know was
how one of his many lovers described him.

21
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,083
He was controversial.

22
00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:36,993
Now did you know,
this esteemed establishment told Byron

23
00:02:37,093 --> 00:02:39,700
that he wasn't allowed to bring
his beloved dogs to college?

24
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,516
So he said screw the rules. He went out
and he bought himself a bear.

25
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:49,033
Brought it to class on a chained leash.
He tied up to that very pipe just there.

26
00:02:49,733 --> 00:02:54,700
So you see, it was Byron who defined
the Romantic age, which wasn't about love.

27
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,983
It was about going your own way,

28
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,521
defying authority
and following your heart,

29
00:03:00,621 --> 00:03:03,133
sticking it to the man,
and as many women as possible.

30
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:06,351
Now that... that is Romantic.

31
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,966
And if the faculty
don't like me saying so,

32
00:03:09,066 --> 00:03:11,868
well, they can take this job
and they can shove it.

33
00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:16,107
Because like Mr. Bob Dylan, I ain't gonna
work on Maggie's farm no more.

34
00:03:17,316 --> 00:03:21,703
<i>Dad hated authority,
and everyone loved him for it.</i>

35
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:26,276
<i>All I wanted was to be just like him.</i>

36
00:03:30,453 --> 00:03:32,728
Forget the critics.

37
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:35,203
Let them have their opinions.

38
00:03:35,303 --> 00:03:39,353
Let them publish their books and brag
about them at tedious faculty parties,

39
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:44,363
and let university librarians
file those books away.

40
00:03:44,728 --> 00:03:47,553
The faculty has called this class

41
00:03:47,653 --> 00:03:52,202
"The Romantics and Literary Theory."

42
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,045
I want you all to forget
the second half of this sentence.

43
00:03:57,145 --> 00:04:01,055
There's nothing theoretical
about the romantics.

44
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:06,503
"Where true love burns,

45
00:04:06,603 --> 00:04:11,405
"desire is love's pure passion.

46
00:04:12,178 --> 00:04:15,053
"It is the reflex

47
00:04:15,153 --> 00:04:17,803
"of our earthly frame...

48
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,645
"that takes its meaning
from the nobler part

49
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:24,426
and but translates...

50
00:04:24,826 --> 00:04:27,634
the language of the heart."

51
00:04:30,678 --> 00:04:33,522
Wakey, wakey, Professor Haig.

52
00:04:34,911 --> 00:04:38,455
Oh, shit. It's Saturday, isn't it?

53
00:04:38,555 --> 00:04:41,378
No, don't look like that.
Are you sure about this?

54
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:43,503
I mean, I make a terrible
first impression.

55
00:04:43,603 --> 00:04:47,370
Will you relax, Richard?
My dad is gonna love you.

56
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,336
- Really?
- Yeah, you'll have lots to talk about.

57
00:04:50,436 --> 00:04:54,592
Yeah? Corporate hard-nosed raider
meets libidinous lit professor.

58
00:04:54,692 --> 00:04:56,954
- It's a match made in heaven.
- I just want my dad

59
00:04:57,054 --> 00:05:00,075
to meet the wonderful man
I've been dating for the last six months.

60
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,578
- Six months?
- Broke your record, didn't I?

61
00:05:03,078 --> 00:05:06,203
- Crazy.
- "Love is begun by time,

62
00:05:06,303 --> 00:05:10,705
and time qualifies the spark
and fire of it all."

63
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:14,644
Relax, you're still very sparky, darling.
Really sparky, I mean...

64
00:05:14,744 --> 00:05:19,011
Well, my liege, I must hie me
to Heathrow, thou to London,

65
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:22,483
- chimes of 6:00 sharp.
- Sure, of course.

66
00:05:22,593 --> 00:05:25,513
- Sharp.
- Sharp. 6:00. Chimes.

67
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:53,769
Sal.

68
00:05:53,869 --> 00:05:57,046
Sal, I've got to go. Why?

69
00:05:57,146 --> 00:06:01,694
Because we've been talking for so long
I've lost track of time, space, and myself.

70
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:06,399
<i>Hello? Hello? Olivia?</i>

71
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,993
- Not to worry, madame.
- I'll call maintenance.

72
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:11,678
- We'll fish it out later.
- <i>Are you there? Can you hear me?</i>

73
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:14,508
- Please don't.
- <i>Hello?</i>

74
00:06:15,136 --> 00:06:16,921
<i>Olivia?</i>

75
00:06:36,253 --> 00:06:37,911
<i>Aúpa!</i>

76
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:41,896
There you go. They fishing
your phone out of the drain?

77
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:45,869
No.

78
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:50,795
I told them not to.
I am cutting myself off from the world.

79
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:53,913
Footloose, fancy-free.

80
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:59,709
Won't that be lonely?
An island unto yourself?

81
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:01,828
- No.
- Madame?

82
00:07:01,928 --> 00:07:04,620
- Can I have a glass of red wine, please?
- Yes, madame.

83
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,414
No. I would populate the island
with all new people.

84
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:13,902
People that I actually like.

85
00:07:14,002 --> 00:07:16,059
Yes, but then things change.

86
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:18,243
The people you thought you'd like...

87
00:07:18,343 --> 00:07:20,829
turn out to be as bad
as the people you left behind.

88
00:07:21,109 --> 00:07:25,025
Soon you're moving to another island,
and so it goes on, ad infinitum.

89
00:07:25,743 --> 00:07:29,678
You know my solution?
Get along with everyone.

90
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:32,218
Really?

91
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:37,394
Then why are you here alone
in a hotel bar on a Saturday night?

92
00:07:37,594 --> 00:07:40,428
Well, I certainly
wouldn't keep you waiting.

93
00:07:41,518 --> 00:07:45,709
Exactly. Because you never know
what kind of...

94
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:49,161
handsome stranger
I might start talking to.

95
00:07:53,518 --> 00:07:57,151
"I do desire we become
better strangers."

96
00:07:57,251 --> 00:07:59,744
Pulling out the Shakespeare.

97
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:01,901
Is that line successful
for you normally?

98
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:04,784
I had my moments with it, you know?

99
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,476
<i>Comme ci, comme ca.</i>

100
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:09,403
Excuse me, sir. Ma'am.

101
00:08:12,138 --> 00:08:15,801
Thank you. You're so kind.

102
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:18,635
There you go. Back on the grid.

103
00:08:19,243 --> 00:08:21,401
Why is that the most helpful people

104
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,416
are always around
when you do not want any help?

105
00:08:24,516 --> 00:08:28,017
Give him a minute.
He'll be back with a shoemaker.

106
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:34,176
On the other hand, it's nice to be
looked after every now and then.

107
00:08:34,276 --> 00:08:37,401
The other day I found myself
opening a door for a man.

108
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:39,726
What happened to chivalry?

109
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:43,751
- You know why guys open doors for women?
- No.

110
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:46,076
So we can check out your asses
as you walk by.

111
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:49,280
Well, you're just full of all these
amazing insights, aren't you?

112
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,462
I can tell within one minute
of meeting someone...

113
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,769
if I want to be with them.

114
00:08:57,809 --> 00:08:59,892
How about me?

115
00:08:59,992 --> 00:09:01,728
Do you want to be with me?

116
00:09:03,317 --> 00:09:05,003
Yes.

117
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,428
For one more minute.

118
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:11,657
Okay.

119
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:15,797
You've got a minute.

120
00:09:16,517 --> 00:09:19,036
What are you going to do with it?

121
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:26,501
Olivia? Oh, my God! Hi!

122
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:28,836
What are you doing here?

123
00:09:30,442 --> 00:09:33,917
I was in Dublin in the book festival,

124
00:09:34,017 --> 00:09:36,249
and Dad called me and told me
that you were coming,

125
00:09:36,349 --> 00:09:40,176
that he was meeting you here, and that
I should come and surprise you. Surprise!

126
00:09:40,276 --> 00:09:43,034
- He flaked on us, didn't he?
- Yes.

127
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:45,636
So how did you two make
the connection? Hi!

128
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:49,631
You're the famous Olivia?

129
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:56,142
My beautiful sister Olivia.
Olivia, my gorgeous Englishman...

130
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:59,578
- ...Richard Haig. Thank you.
- You look great.

131
00:10:01,984 --> 00:10:05,376
So me, my dad, and my mom are staying
at this hotel that we always stay at,

132
00:10:05,476 --> 00:10:10,076
and my dad keeps running off saying he has
meetings, or appointments, or whatever.

133
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:13,817
And finally my mom gets fed up,
and she decides to tail him one day

134
00:10:14,117 --> 00:10:16,426
to one of his "meetings".

135
00:10:16,676 --> 00:10:19,392
Ends up following him
to the other end of the beach

136
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:23,243
where Livvy is staying with her mom.

137
00:10:23,809 --> 00:10:26,667
And all hell breaks loose.

138
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:29,126
Our dad is leading a double life,

139
00:10:29,226 --> 00:10:33,392
- like raising two families at the same time.
- What a naughty boy.

140
00:10:33,492 --> 00:10:36,161
Right? Crazy.

141
00:10:39,276 --> 00:10:41,023
Anyway...

142
00:10:41,523 --> 00:10:46,251
I take Kate to the beach, I'm sitting there
and I'm trying to process everything.

143
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:50,001
What my father did, my poor mom,

144
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:52,651
and the fact that I have
this little lovely sister.

145
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:55,417
For me, I mean, I was stoked.
I always wanted a big sister.

146
00:10:55,517 --> 00:11:01,259
And I decide the only way we can protect
each other from this craziness

147
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:06,070
is if Kate and I make
a pact, no secrets.

148
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,334
Absolute honesty.

149
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:12,192
From this day forward,
we would tell each other everything.

150
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:14,662
No matter what, always.

151
00:11:14,762 --> 00:11:18,642
And we have.
And we're, like, best friends.

152
00:11:18,742 --> 00:11:20,517
So, Livvy...

153
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,187
how is your Alan?

154
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:27,092
What?

155
00:11:27,808 --> 00:11:29,440
Please. Tell us about Alan.

156
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:33,403
He's great.

157
00:11:33,851 --> 00:11:38,209
Livvy's Alan is the Alan Sloan.
You know, the romance writer?

158
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:40,834
And Livvy edits his books,
and they're totally in love.

159
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:43,901
Madly and totally in love
with a romance writer.

160
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:46,717
- That sounds fascinating.
- Well,

161
00:11:46,817 --> 00:11:51,334
no more than the Romantics professor's
passion for his students, surely.

162
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:53,601
- Livvy, be nice.
- Yes, Kate.

163
00:11:53,701 --> 00:11:55,751
Would either of you like
a little taste of my steak?

164
00:11:55,851 --> 00:11:58,519
- No thanks.
- It's very tender.

165
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:05,269
- You're unbelievable, aren't you?
- I'm sorry?

166
00:12:05,369 --> 00:12:08,667
Of course. On the verge
of graduating, going home.

167
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:10,542
She's the perfect catch
for you, isn't she?

168
00:12:10,642 --> 00:12:12,909
- Hey.
- I get it. I get it.

169
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:16,584
He's hot, and funny, and smart,

170
00:12:16,684 --> 00:12:19,342
and he's got the suave accent.

171
00:12:19,442 --> 00:12:23,945
But all I see is a lothario
with an eternally wandering eye

172
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:26,609
who simply charmed
the pants off you, literally.

173
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:31,834
- Livvy, what are you doing?
- Kate, I know this feels like love,

174
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:35,750
but no, no, no, no.
This is not love. This is a fling.

175
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,192
How do you know?
What are you even saying?

176
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:42,697
Obviously, you're looking
for a father figure, but in our case

177
00:12:42,797 --> 00:12:48,553
it means a self-centered, cheating
womanizer who's not to be trusted.

178
00:12:48,653 --> 00:12:51,075
And you're just so young,
you can't see it.

179
00:12:51,175 --> 00:12:53,192
How young were you
when you ran off with Anwar.

180
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:55,809
- We thought I was pregnant!
- Well, I am.

181
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,692
- What?
- What?

182
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:02,952
- I wanted to tell you earlier, but...
- Pregnant? With a baby?

183
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:05,671
Yeah.

184
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:09,275
I wanted to tell you another way,
but this is like so weird, I just...

185
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:13,020
No, this is the perfect way.
This is really the perfect way, I think.

186
00:13:14,475 --> 00:13:17,950
You know what? This is great.
Really great.

187
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:22,392
- Well, that was so heartfelt.
- Livvy. Livvy.

188
00:13:22,492 --> 00:13:24,726
Thank you so much for supper.

189
00:13:24,826 --> 00:13:27,625
Remind me never to do this again.

190
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:30,142
I'm just going to go outside
and get some fresh air.

191
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,709
- What do you mean?
- Excuse me. Air.

192
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:33,599
- Yeah, run.
- What?

193
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:35,667
- Richard?
- Yeah?

194
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:37,434
- Richard? Look.
- Yeah, I'm here.

195
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:42,125
I know I just dropped a bomb on you
back there, so right here, right now,

196
00:13:42,225 --> 00:13:44,809
- I'm giving you the out.
- I just want some air, that's all.

197
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:49,327
You just need some time to think.
It's fine. I get it.

198
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:54,275
So I'm moving to LA.

199
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,142
I got a really cool job
at a venture capital firm.

200
00:13:57,542 --> 00:14:00,192
- You're full of surprises today.
- You'll love LA.

201
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:03,875
It'll be like Cambridge-ish,
but with a lot of palm trees,

202
00:14:03,975 --> 00:14:07,502
and, like, chicks with tans and stuff.

203
00:14:09,992 --> 00:14:13,142
- Oh, honey, you're all clammy.
- I just need some air. That's all, really.

204
00:14:13,242 --> 00:14:14,834
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay.

205
00:14:14,934 --> 00:14:17,849
I'll be back in there. Go ahead. You go.

206
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:20,242
- Richard.
- Yeah?

207
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:25,279
- You're going to be a great father.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

208
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:36,771
Did you have a good dinner then, sir?

209
00:14:54,165 --> 00:14:57,759
All right, where the buggering hell
have you been? I said 6:00.

210
00:14:57,859 --> 00:15:02,747
Sorry about that, Dad. Didn't realize
your grumbling ran on such a tight schedule.

211
00:15:03,617 --> 00:15:06,561
Bloody miserable out there, as usual.

212
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:13,250
Don't touch that.

213
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,642
Good God, Dad. I'm not five years old.

214
00:15:15,742 --> 00:15:18,717
- Hi, Richard, dear.
- Hello, Joan.

215
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:23,642
- How is everything?
- Oh, just terrific. Thanks for asking.

216
00:15:23,742 --> 00:15:27,034
You still boffing
that Yank totty, are you?

217
00:15:27,434 --> 00:15:30,017
Yes, she's a great girl.

218
00:15:30,117 --> 00:15:33,192
Bright, beautiful, ambitious.

219
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:37,672
You mean a horrible little upstart
determined to go places.

220
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:41,575
So, tell me, when are you going
to start going places?

221
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:43,392
- Good God. Please.
- Oh, come on. Jesus.

222
00:15:43,492 --> 00:15:45,376
Come on, when I was your age,

223
00:15:45,476 --> 00:15:48,442
I mean, I'd been the head
of the department for seven years.

224
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:51,708
Yeah, and it made you
so happy, didn't it, Dad?

225
00:15:51,808 --> 00:15:53,758
All right, what's the grievance today?

226
00:15:53,858 --> 00:15:57,767
Split infinitives, too many used?
Too many women with jobs?

227
00:15:57,867 --> 00:16:01,758
It's his waterworks. He's got
to go back into hospital next week.

228
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:04,827
Stop talking about my cock, woman.

229
00:16:10,258 --> 00:16:12,710
Tell me something, Dad.

230
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,867
Why did you and Mom get married?

231
00:16:18,967 --> 00:16:22,492
What kind of an inane question is that
for a Thursday evening?

232
00:16:22,592 --> 00:16:25,183
For a man who revels
in reckless promiscuity,

233
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,952
your four marriages
do beg some questions.

234
00:16:29,808 --> 00:16:32,953
Your mother fed me regularly.

235
00:16:33,053 --> 00:16:36,417
She pleasured me
half decently now and then.

236
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:40,892
- What more could a man want?
- Oh, I don't know, friendship?

237
00:16:40,992 --> 00:16:44,919
Someone to see the world with,
have a laugh with?

238
00:16:45,158 --> 00:16:47,485
Maybe even start a family with.

239
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:51,400
Good God, man.

240
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,967
You've fallen for that little slice
of American pie.

241
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:56,775
- Dad...
- Now you listen to me.

242
00:16:56,875 --> 00:17:01,525
This might be the most important
bit of advice that I ever give you.

243
00:17:02,475 --> 00:17:07,487
American women may be fun and Victoria's
Secret when you first bed them,

244
00:17:07,587 --> 00:17:11,242
but as soon as they get their claws
into you, they stop fucking

245
00:17:11,342 --> 00:17:16,570
and start eating, and the only ass
you're going to get is a fat one.

246
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,823
Why did open my mouth?

247
00:17:17,923 --> 00:17:23,633
American women invariably become
spouters of self-help platitudes,

248
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:28,642
they're addicted to designer labels,
dieting, and frozen yogurt.

249
00:17:28,742 --> 00:17:33,200
Overall, thoroughly nasty,
selfish, vain creatures

250
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,677
that don't fuck!

251
00:17:37,742 --> 00:17:40,987
Thank you for your fatherly advice.

252
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,329
Good night, Joan.

253
00:17:45,175 --> 00:17:49,243
Bugger off then! See if I care.

254
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,808
Kate! Kate!

255
00:17:58,908 --> 00:18:01,933
Screw Cambridge. I'm in.

256
00:18:02,033 --> 00:18:03,615
- Really?
- Really.

257
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,252
- Really?
- Yes, come on!

258
00:18:08,742 --> 00:18:12,308
<i>Up and away we set off</i>

259
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,352
<i>Secretly scared we'd get lost</i>

260
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:20,958
<i>Up in the clouds over the town</i>

261
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,730
<i>Beyond the wall</i>

262
00:18:25,042 --> 00:18:29,042
<i>Some of us knew we might fall</i>

263
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:32,937
<i>Under the weight of it all</i>

264
00:18:33,142 --> 00:18:37,175
<i>And though we'd been warned
of the oncoming storms</i>

265
00:18:37,275 --> 00:18:40,513
<i>Still we stood tall</i>

266
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,302
<i>So from the moonlight</i>

267
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,625
<i>Straight to the sunrise</i>

268
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:53,467
<i>This will be our time</i>

269
00:18:53,725 --> 00:18:57,854
<i>Free-falling nosedive</i>

270
00:19:04,817 --> 00:19:07,158
Look into the world, Jakey.

271
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:10,516
It's a beautiful world.

272
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,058
Do you need the booby now?
Do you want the booby?

273
00:19:15,158 --> 00:19:19,025
Yes. There's a boy after my own heart.

274
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:26,129
<i>The whole world in our sights</i>

275
00:19:26,229 --> 00:19:30,299
<i>Like a miniature paradise...</i>

276
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:39,373
Okay, family, here we go.

277
00:19:39,473 --> 00:19:43,833
Here you are, Jakey. Welcome home.
A modest little house...

278
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,311
which your granddad bought
your mom out of guilt.

279
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:48,575
- Don't fall in the pool.
- I won't.

280
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:50,841
You probably will never meet anyway.

281
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:53,051
He has a very bad habit
of never showing up.

282
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,369
Hey.

283
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:57,677
All right.

284
00:20:02,825 --> 00:20:05,541
Oh, I'm going to call Livvy.
Can you take the baby?

285
00:20:05,641 --> 00:20:07,590
- Sure.
- Okay.

286
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,227
Okay.

287
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:44,527
I know it's easier to read the critics
and the CliffNotes,

288
00:20:45,616 --> 00:20:47,683
but forget about them.

289
00:20:47,783 --> 00:20:51,841
Read the poems. Put the time in.

290
00:20:52,241 --> 00:20:57,857
After all, "Nothing will come
of nothing."

291
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:01,321
What was that from?

292
00:21:05,908 --> 00:21:07,450
Anyone?

293
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,291
- Hey. There you go.
- I'm having trouble getting on the Wi-Fi.

294
00:21:11,391 --> 00:21:12,677
What's the password again?

295
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,717
I think they're all on Prozac.

296
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,391
Did you hear from the university yet?

297
00:21:20,591 --> 00:21:24,182
- No. They went with the other guy.
- I told you to kiss ass more.

298
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:27,724
- Angela, please.
- I'm sure something will open up soon at ULA.

299
00:21:27,824 --> 00:21:30,076
Yeah, well, one can
only hope, can't one?

300
00:21:30,176 --> 00:21:33,416
In the meantime, I'm glad that
you're still slumming it here with us.

301
00:21:33,516 --> 00:21:36,041
You city college lot
don't pull any punches do you?

302
00:21:36,141 --> 00:21:38,784
- We will go 16 rounds with anyone.
- Bring it on.

303
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:55,535
Asshole.

304
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,933
Asshole.

305
00:21:58,033 --> 00:22:01,016
Never let me hear you
say that word, Jake.

306
00:22:01,516 --> 00:22:05,441
The word is "ahh's-hole" not "aah's-hole."
Can you say "ahh's-hole?"

307
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:08,933
- Asshole.
- Yes, elongate the A.

308
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,010
There we go.

309
00:22:11,441 --> 00:22:13,818
I'll get them. I'll get them.

310
00:22:16,158 --> 00:22:19,342
- Mama!
- No, mama is at work.

311
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:23,602
- She'll be back later.
- Mama.

312
00:22:28,191 --> 00:22:31,678
No, that's Hummer. Hummer.

313
00:22:32,075 --> 00:22:33,841
Well done. Hummer.

314
00:22:33,941 --> 00:22:35,283
- Pull over.
- What?

315
00:22:35,383 --> 00:22:38,629
- Pull over! Listen to this voicemail.
- I can't pull over.

316
00:22:41,175 --> 00:22:42,576
<i>I thought he was saying "mama,"</i>

317
00:22:42,676 --> 00:22:46,641
<i>and then I realized he was pointing
at one of those absurdly oversized tanks</i>

318
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:50,891
<i>driven no doubt by some idiot
with an absurdly undersized penis.</i>

319
00:22:50,991 --> 00:22:53,266
- This is not an oversized car.
- <i>All right.</i>

320
00:22:53,766 --> 00:22:55,276
He knows.

321
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:05,874
- Hey there, sexy. Where are you?
- I'm in New York.

322
00:23:05,974 --> 00:23:07,866
Honey, do I look chunky?

323
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:10,100
Didn't mean to call you sexy.
Wrong person.

324
00:23:11,499 --> 00:23:14,023
No, I look good.

325
00:23:14,633 --> 00:23:16,174
<i>Very funny. Is Kate there?</i>

326
00:23:16,274 --> 00:23:19,324
She's not back yet, still banking.
Busy counting things.

327
00:23:19,424 --> 00:23:22,049
Well, tell her to call me
right, right away,

328
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:24,474
because I have something
really big to tell her.

329
00:23:24,574 --> 00:23:27,833
No secrets in the family. Pray tell.

330
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:29,958
<i>I can't believe
that I'm about to tell you...</i>

331
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:34,253
Richard, I don't know
why this is so hard for me.

332
00:23:34,353 --> 00:23:37,324
I've been trying
to tell you now for weeks.

333
00:23:37,424 --> 00:23:41,151
- Alan's asked me to marry him.
- I'm in love with somebody else.

334
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:43,874
You're what?

335
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:47,616
We're getting married! Don't act
so surprised that somebody asked me.

336
00:23:47,716 --> 00:23:49,808
- Are you on the phone?
- Who is it?

337
00:23:49,908 --> 00:23:52,548
- Who are you talking to?
- Answer the question. Who is it?

338
00:23:52,648 --> 00:23:55,809
- I just did!
- Who's on the phone?

339
00:23:56,766 --> 00:23:58,158
- Hello?
- Kate! Kate!

340
00:23:58,258 --> 00:24:01,866
- I have to call you back.
- What? Hello?

341
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:07,524
I was just, I mean... I was
really young, okay? Really young.

342
00:24:07,624 --> 00:24:11,316
Not that you're not, of course.
But I really thought that I loved you,

343
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,874
but clearly I was working
through daddy issues.

344
00:24:13,974 --> 00:24:19,441
And then I got pregnant, and you
were just trying to do the right thing.

345
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:24,335
And you've been a really good father, but
let's face it, you never really loved me.

346
00:24:24,435 --> 00:24:27,958
- But Brian does.
- Brian? Brian?

347
00:24:28,058 --> 00:24:30,041
That little idiot from the office?

348
00:24:30,141 --> 00:24:34,733
He likes to talk to me about start-ups
and acquisitions and exit strategies.

349
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:37,399
I mean, all the stuff that you think
is so boring about me.

350
00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:39,374
It is boring. God.

351
00:24:39,474 --> 00:24:43,649
Why do you have to be so
goddamn English? Talk to me!

352
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:48,741
You can leave me,
but I am not leaving that boy.

353
00:24:48,841 --> 00:24:50,524
Brian.

354
00:24:51,224 --> 00:24:52,979
Richard,

355
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:55,457
why can't you just talk to me?

356
00:25:06,516 --> 00:25:09,274
Now, I know two years in the pool house

357
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:12,249
makes me look a little a nut,
but I'll say two things.

358
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:15,399
First, your mom and Brian
hated me being there,

359
00:25:15,499 --> 00:25:17,974
which was the most wonderful
incentive to stay.

360
00:25:18,074 --> 00:25:19,726
And secondly...

361
00:25:21,374 --> 00:25:23,801
I wanted to be close to you.

362
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:26,601
Good morning.

363
00:25:27,908 --> 00:25:30,862
I think you're going
to want to see this.

364
00:25:31,058 --> 00:25:34,674
- Oh, let me see it.
- Is the big bad professor awake yet?

365
00:25:34,774 --> 00:25:38,816
<i>Jake to Dad. Breaker, breaker.
You got your ears on?</i>

366
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:40,474
- Okay.
- <i>Are you awake?</i>

367
00:25:40,574 --> 00:25:45,076
- It's Jakey. Just a second.
- <i>Get up! Are you having a sleepover?</i>

368
00:25:46,074 --> 00:25:48,916
Hi, Jakey! Good morning.

369
00:25:49,016 --> 00:25:51,541
- Where are you?
- <i>Can I come and play?</i>

370
00:25:51,641 --> 00:25:53,299
Just a second, Jakey.

371
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:55,699
- Hey.
- Hi!

372
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:59,019
Would you mind just skedaddling for now?
It's my son.

373
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:02,341
Your son? I love kids! I babysit!

374
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:04,774
- Sorry about this. The perils of parenthood.
- It's okay.

375
00:26:04,874 --> 00:26:06,593
- Come and see me during the week.
- When?

376
00:26:06,693 --> 00:26:09,516
- Make it a surprise.
- Oh, I love surprises! Okay, I will.

377
00:26:09,616 --> 00:26:11,862
Okay, good-bye.

378
00:26:11,962 --> 00:26:14,397
- Who was that?
- Oh, just a friend of mine.

379
00:26:14,497 --> 00:26:17,518
Very busy lady. She had to leave.
There you go.

380
00:26:18,641 --> 00:26:20,380
Aren't these uncomfortable?

381
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,849
That's why girls love it when you
take them off. Let's get some pancakes.

382
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,599
Dad, get on with it.

383
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:28,877
So there we were.

384
00:26:30,116 --> 00:26:31,880
And then...

385
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,813
last week...

386
00:26:33,913 --> 00:26:36,374
everything went pear-shaped.

387
00:26:36,474 --> 00:26:38,834
I have the papers you asked for.

388
00:26:40,249 --> 00:26:44,376
- Will that be all, professor?
- For now, yes, thanks.

389
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:49,009
Great.

390
00:26:49,766 --> 00:26:51,501
Excuse me.

391
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:54,741
Newest member of the TA
of the month club?

392
00:26:54,841 --> 00:26:57,038
How dare you insinuate such a thing?

393
00:26:57,138 --> 00:27:00,643
- You have a visitor. Be nice.
- Send them in.

394
00:27:01,591 --> 00:27:02,984
Thank you.

395
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:10,199
- Professor Pickard, what a delight!
- How's your father these days?

396
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:13,807
- Loving life. He is happy as a clam.
- That's good to hear.

397
00:27:13,907 --> 00:27:17,216
Well, I received your application
for the position at the University.

398
00:27:17,316 --> 00:27:21,141
I was in the area, so I thought I would
just pop by and invite you to a soirée

399
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:23,074
- I'm giving tomorrow.
- Splendid.

400
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:25,057
The faculty will be there, of course.

401
00:27:25,157 --> 00:27:28,766
I thought it might be a good idea if you do
come by and just sort of butter them up.

402
00:27:28,866 --> 00:27:32,046
Not me, by the way.
I consider myself lavishly buttered.

403
00:27:32,146 --> 00:27:33,774
Oh, well, that's good to know.

404
00:27:33,874 --> 00:27:36,757
- So we'll see you there.
- Wouldn't miss it for the world.

405
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:40,566
"Dustin Kalarney"
just sold its 5 millionth copy.

406
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:43,016
- You're unbelievable.
- What?

407
00:27:43,116 --> 00:27:47,866
Here I am, splayed out like an open-faced
sandwich so we can have a baby,

408
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,857
- and all you care about...
- Mr. Sloan.

409
00:27:51,324 --> 00:27:53,707
Would you mind signing a copy
of your book for me?

410
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:57,774
- Of course. Did you like it?
- Are you kidding? It was great.

411
00:27:57,874 --> 00:28:01,072
Really? Is that Desiree two Es or one E?

412
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,641
What the hell was that for?

413
00:28:04,741 --> 00:28:07,826
Oops, it slipped.
Can I have my phone back, please?

414
00:28:09,432 --> 00:28:11,791
There you go, you can do it.
Just concentrate.

415
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:15,924
- Nice big swing. That's it.
- Dad, I suck.

416
00:28:16,024 --> 00:28:19,041
No, you don't, you don't.
You look great, just eye on the ball.

417
00:28:19,141 --> 00:28:22,875
Who's here! Jakey, what up, dawg?
Yo, give me some love.

418
00:28:22,975 --> 00:28:24,524
Blow it up. Blow it up.

419
00:28:24,624 --> 00:28:26,742
- Jellyfish sting!
- Jellyfish sting!

420
00:28:26,842 --> 00:28:29,257
Lots of love. We were just
playing a little ball here.

421
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:31,649
- Right. Sorry, sorry.
- That's all right. Okay.

422
00:28:32,595 --> 00:28:35,316
What are you doing? You're a righty.
You got to switch your hands around.

423
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:39,057
- Come around there. Bat up!
- Eye on the ball. Hit it to Dad!

424
00:28:39,782 --> 00:28:42,991
Sorry, Dad! Are you okay? Are you okay?

425
00:28:43,091 --> 00:28:46,932
I'm okay, son. I'm all right.
Just... occupational hazard.

426
00:28:47,032 --> 00:28:50,549
- That looks pretty bad.
- No, this. It's okay.

427
00:28:50,649 --> 00:28:52,491
Jakey!

428
00:28:52,741 --> 00:28:54,057
- Hey.
- Hey.

429
00:28:54,157 --> 00:28:57,828
- Did you remember Atlanta?
- Yeah. No? Atlanta?

430
00:28:57,928 --> 00:29:00,599
- Brian and I, four days, conference.
- Got it.

431
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:03,592
- We leave the day after tomorrow.
- Good. Sounds good. I'll be there.

432
00:29:03,692 --> 00:29:05,307
- No, you'll be here.
- I'll be here.

433
00:29:05,407 --> 00:29:07,337
- Yeah. Here's Jakey's schedule.
- Great.

434
00:29:07,437 --> 00:29:09,732
I left a copy in your room
and another one on the fridge.

435
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:12,277
- All right. That's good.
- So, yeah.

436
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:14,334
I'm on it. Jawohl!

437
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:17,284
Okay.

438
00:29:18,416 --> 00:29:20,565
No, I understand,

439
00:29:20,665 --> 00:29:25,111
but I strongly believe that three slaves
is enough. It's enough. Come on.

440
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:36,301
You!

441
00:29:41,216 --> 00:29:43,034
Dr. Collins!

442
00:29:47,174 --> 00:29:48,459
Son of a bitch!

443
00:29:53,115 --> 00:29:55,034
Yeah!

444
00:29:55,974 --> 00:29:57,759
Jesus.

445
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,057
Come in.

446
00:30:01,457 --> 00:30:04,240
- Shouldn't you be at work?
- Yeah, covering the Asian markets.

447
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,657
Oh, hey, by the way, I can get you
in on a pretty sweet no-load.

448
00:30:07,757 --> 00:30:11,045
These guys are killing it right now. I can
get you 15%, 18%. Just say the word.

449
00:30:11,145 --> 00:30:13,390
The word is no.
What is it you want? I'm busy.

450
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:16,010
This letter came for you. It's about
your green card. I'm sorry.

451
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,649
- I opened it before I saw who...
- Just read it, Brian, thank you.

452
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:21,752
- I mean, you've opened it. Just read it.
- All right. "This is your final warning.

453
00:30:21,852 --> 00:30:24,482
If you and your spouse fail to attend
your interview next week,

454
00:30:24,582 --> 00:30:27,559
deportation proceedings
will be initiated."

455
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:34,201
Blimey, mate. Looks like you could be
in a spot of bother with the Bobbies.

456
00:30:35,699 --> 00:30:38,907
Keep working on the accent, Brian.
Close the door on the way out.

457
00:30:39,007 --> 00:30:41,340
- Cheerio.
- Shut up.

458
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,026
I love the dentist.
I'm not drooling, am I?

459
00:30:45,865 --> 00:30:47,932
Hello, Mr. Haig.

460
00:30:48,032 --> 00:30:50,674
You can't drink alcohol
when taking this medication.

461
00:30:50,774 --> 00:30:51,807
- Really?
- Yes.

462
00:30:51,907 --> 00:30:52,867
- No?
- No.

463
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:55,374
Absolutely not. Wouldn't dream of it.
Thank you so much.

464
00:30:55,474 --> 00:30:56,865
- No alcohol.
- Good.

465
00:30:56,965 --> 00:30:58,790
- We'll see you soon.
- Can't wait.

466
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,057
Look forward to it. Thank you so much.

467
00:31:01,157 --> 00:31:02,782
- No alcohol.
- No alcohol.

468
00:31:02,882 --> 00:31:04,801
- I mean it.
- I mean it, too.

469
00:31:11,515 --> 00:31:14,449
Okay, let's go this way.
Any time you feel like it,

470
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:18,057
- jump in and lavish me with praise.
- Copy that.

471
00:31:18,157 --> 00:31:21,049
- So glad you could make it!
- Oh, thank you!

472
00:31:21,149 --> 00:31:22,632
- Here you are.
- Thanks. Wonderful.

473
00:31:22,832 --> 00:31:27,490
Please, help yourself to refreshments.
My wife made her famous cheese balls.

474
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,374
Please be sure to try one
and compliment her accordingly.

475
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:32,349
Will do.

476
00:31:33,949 --> 00:31:37,974
There are some very, very important
people here. I'd like you to meet them.

477
00:31:38,074 --> 00:31:41,170
And they are your kind
of people, Richard.

478
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,255
Come this way.

479
00:31:46,115 --> 00:31:49,749
My dear colleagues,
this is Richard Haig.

480
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:52,279
This is Professor Vale, Bates, Berg,

481
00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:54,076
- Ang and Professor Jones.
- Hello.

482
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,534
Can we do that again?
I forgot your names already.

483
00:32:01,807 --> 00:32:05,315
It is a damn shame we didn't hire you,
what was it, three years ago?

484
00:32:05,415 --> 00:32:09,259
Three years, two months, 17 days.
But who's counting?

485
00:32:09,715 --> 00:32:11,607
- You know, I met your father once.
- Oh, yeah?

486
00:32:11,707 --> 00:32:15,413
He delivered a fascinating lecture,
a retort to Terry Hearst,

487
00:32:15,513 --> 00:32:18,807
a hermeneutical reading
of Milton's "Paradise Lost."

488
00:32:18,907 --> 00:32:21,637
- Wish I'd been there for that one.
- Where are you from in England?

489
00:32:21,737 --> 00:32:24,632
- And are you a Rich or a Dick?
- I'm a Richard.

490
00:32:24,732 --> 00:32:27,724
- Your father took a structural stance...
- You know, the missus and I,

491
00:32:27,824 --> 00:32:30,093
we love it over there,
we go every summer.

492
00:32:30,193 --> 00:32:33,390
- You do? Great.
- Cheers again, matey.

493
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,615
Richard, I want to let you know
that these fervent minds here

494
00:32:36,715 --> 00:32:39,640
have taken great care looking over
your application material.

495
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,632
Never trust an Englishman
who doesn't drink, Richie boy.

496
00:32:42,732 --> 00:32:45,037
- Syllabus...
- ...epistemological level.

497
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:46,299
Academics. Yup, yup, yup.

498
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,274
- I do have one small question for you.
- This one's the biggest yapper of them all.

499
00:32:50,374 --> 00:32:54,217
How are the Romantics relevant
to today's students?

500
00:32:58,374 --> 00:32:59,986
You want me to answer this question now?

501
00:33:00,086 --> 00:33:04,290
I'm sure we'd all enjoy hearing
just a taste of one of your lectures.

502
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:06,774
- A taste.
- A mere amuse-bouche is all.

503
00:33:07,274 --> 00:33:10,632
Why not the whole meal? Why don't you
come down and see me in action?

504
00:33:10,732 --> 00:33:13,293
- I happen to be free on Thursday.
- Christ, what about that?

505
00:33:13,393 --> 00:33:15,892
I see you've already met my wife.

506
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:23,540
I'm just going to go outside for a moment
here, and just jump in front of a bus.

507
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,790
Where are you going?
You didn't even say goodbye!

508
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,775
That's true.

509
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,532
Bye!

510
00:33:30,932 --> 00:33:33,036
I wonder if he was flirting with me.

511
00:33:33,648 --> 00:33:35,597
Oh, my God.

512
00:33:39,907 --> 00:33:41,900
Oh, shit.

513
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,553
Oh, bollocks.

514
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,373
Shit.

515
00:34:08,473 --> 00:34:11,991
Good evening, Officer. Oh, boy.
Have I been drinking?

516
00:34:13,373 --> 00:34:15,965
I drink every night. How about you?

517
00:34:16,665 --> 00:34:19,254
Can't we all just get along?

518
00:34:31,615 --> 00:34:33,327
Thanks.

519
00:34:36,615 --> 00:34:39,073
Thanks again for bailing me out.

520
00:34:39,173 --> 00:34:42,444
- And for the silent treatment.
- Don't talk to me.

521
00:34:49,782 --> 00:34:51,468
I still can't believe it.

522
00:34:51,568 --> 00:34:54,177
- Can't believe what?
- I wasn't talking to you.

523
00:34:54,277 --> 00:34:58,743
And I wasn't talking to you,
my darling little fornicating ex-wife.

524
00:34:58,843 --> 00:35:00,907
- Shut up, Richard.
- Alan dumped me.

525
00:35:01,007 --> 00:35:04,928
What a small world.
My wife did exactly the same thing.

526
00:35:05,028 --> 00:35:07,202
She used to adore me.

527
00:35:07,823 --> 00:35:10,057
Where, oh, where did the love go?

528
00:35:10,157 --> 00:35:12,340
She turned 30 and wised up.

529
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,955
So, what's going on?
Why are you here, Olivia?

530
00:35:16,055 --> 00:35:18,582
- Thank you so much for helping out.
- It's the least I can do.

531
00:35:18,682 --> 00:35:21,086
- Helping out? Helping out with what?
- I needed to know

532
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:24,899
that Jake was going to be looked after,
fed, and driven by a responsible person

533
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:27,765
- with a valid driver's license.
- Fine. Why her?

534
00:35:27,865 --> 00:35:31,057
Livvy offered to come
at a very difficult time for her

535
00:35:31,157 --> 00:35:34,211
to bail us out of the mess
that you put us in.

536
00:35:34,311 --> 00:35:35,884
You know what?

537
00:35:35,984 --> 00:35:40,585
- I've had enough of this.
- You know, you say "I" a lot.

538
00:35:40,685 --> 00:35:45,498
Really? Well, I know that Jake
loves having you around.

539
00:35:45,598 --> 00:35:48,732
But I'm getting phone calls
from your immigration attorney

540
00:35:48,832 --> 00:35:51,323
because you don't ever bother
to call him back.

541
00:35:51,423 --> 00:35:55,607
I can't be in your life anymore.
I'm enabling your degenerate behavior.

542
00:35:55,707 --> 00:35:58,765
And what is the point
of all this right now?

543
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:02,478
Richard, if you want me to pretend
like we're happily married

544
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:06,527
so you can stay in this country,
you better get it together.

545
00:36:20,357 --> 00:36:22,539
- Yeah?
- <i>Gotcha.</i>

546
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:25,457
- <i>I woke you up, didn't I?</i>
- Dad, is that you?

547
00:36:25,557 --> 00:36:29,707
You know, there are no time zones
in China. Did you know that?

548
00:36:29,807 --> 00:36:32,594
<i>The whole bloody country
is on Peking time,</i>

549
00:36:32,707 --> 00:36:35,388
<i>and that's the way it should be.</i>

550
00:36:35,488 --> 00:36:39,115
- We should all be on Peking time.
- <i>Don't be a dumb prat.</i>

551
00:36:39,215 --> 00:36:42,540
The whole world
should be on London time.

552
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,161
Okay. What do you want, Dad?

553
00:36:47,698 --> 00:36:50,190
- How's the little turd?
- Don't call him that.

554
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:53,860
Come on,
you're far too bloody sensitive.

555
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,906
<i>All right, great to hear from you, Dad.</i>

556
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:00,090
Why don't you go badger Joan? Okay?

557
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,778
<i>She's not here.</i>

558
00:37:01,878 --> 00:37:05,927
Shit. Okay. I've got to go. Goodbye.

559
00:37:22,931 --> 00:37:25,027
Richard Haig?

560
00:37:26,073 --> 00:37:27,160
Thank you.

561
00:37:35,531 --> 00:37:37,890
So, your interview is Monday.

562
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:41,056
This is the fourth quarter now, two minute
warning, you got no timeouts left.

563
00:37:41,156 --> 00:37:42,626
What the hell are you talking about?

564
00:37:42,726 --> 00:37:47,681
If your ex-wife won't show up to your
interview, it's going to be Hail Mary time.

565
00:37:47,781 --> 00:37:49,477
Okay?

566
00:37:50,698 --> 00:37:54,140
- So, did you get a full-time job?
- Doing my best.

567
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,706
Have you recently joined
any terrorist organizations?

568
00:37:56,806 --> 00:38:00,194
Applied all over. Fingers crossed.

569
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:05,352
Have you ever been arrested?

570
00:38:07,998 --> 00:38:11,015
- DUI.
- When? How many years ago?

571
00:38:11,115 --> 00:38:14,570
Friday? I mean, they can't kick me
out of the country for that, can they?

572
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,640
- Jakey's a US citizen.
- You see the people in my waiting room?

573
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,529
The kid born here, the parents, illegal.

574
00:38:20,629 --> 00:38:23,240
They're deporting the parents!

575
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,607
Oh, yeah, it's game seven,
win or go home time.

576
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,933
All right, well, if you join
a recovery program now...

577
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,581
What, recovery?

578
00:38:32,681 --> 00:38:35,956
You do the 10 mandated sessions
the court's going to give you for the DUI.

579
00:38:36,056 --> 00:38:38,775
- 10? That's going to take me weeks!
- Hell week, baby. Two-a-days.

580
00:38:38,875 --> 00:38:41,373
You get your ex-wife to your interview
and you get a great job.

581
00:38:41,473 --> 00:38:44,680
You do all that, and you get
the ring, baby, okay?

582
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,645
Yes, of course.

583
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,616
<i>Hijos de puta.</i>

584
00:39:34,515 --> 00:39:36,552
Everything all right?

585
00:39:39,481 --> 00:39:41,590
Yeah. Why?

586
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:43,911
Want to borrow my car?

587
00:39:44,011 --> 00:39:46,763
Okay, if you're not using it.

588
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:03,657
That's good, that's good,
that's good. It's okay!

589
00:40:10,823 --> 00:40:13,148
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

590
00:40:13,248 --> 00:40:15,759
Did Kate tell you about
the one-way system at pick up?

591
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,167
No, I didn't think so. It's okay.

592
00:40:20,889 --> 00:40:24,811
- All right, toots. Step on it.
- Oh, boy.

593
00:40:25,831 --> 00:40:30,481
Stop sign. Stop sign. Stop sign.
Car, car! Jesus.

594
00:40:30,581 --> 00:40:33,156
Where the hell did you learn
how to drive?

595
00:40:33,256 --> 00:40:34,968
Mexico.

596
00:40:35,523 --> 00:40:39,056
Oh, can you please get that?
Where is my phone? Where's my phone?

597
00:40:39,156 --> 00:40:42,387
- I'm waiting for a very important call.
- Here you go. Sorry, it's down here.

598
00:40:44,206 --> 00:40:45,218
Hello?

599
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:48,648
<i>Olivia? I have Tim Prince
from Creative Management Lit for you.</i>

600
00:40:48,748 --> 00:40:51,382
- Okay.
- Can't he dial the phone by himself?

601
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:53,361
- <i>Hey, babes!</i>
- Hi!

602
00:40:53,461 --> 00:40:58,223
- <i>Listen, so sorry about Alan. Awful!</i>
- Thanks, Tim. Thank you.

603
00:40:58,323 --> 00:41:01,120
<i>I caught my ex-wife in downward dog
with my tantra teacher</i>

604
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,880
<i>coming out of her central eye.
You feel so...</i>

605
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,419
- Angry.
- Who the hell is this guy?

606
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:07,913
<i>Okay, listen, babes,</i>

607
00:41:08,013 --> 00:41:11,344
<i>if anyone can go from editor to author,
it's you, and I mean that.</i>

608
00:41:11,444 --> 00:41:14,356
<i>And I got your sample chapter.
Give me a day or two to look it over.</i>

609
00:41:14,456 --> 00:41:16,689
- Of course.
- <i>I'll be gentle. I promise.</i>

610
00:41:16,789 --> 00:41:20,010
- Who says I like it gentle?
- <i>That's my girl. Okay, got to jump.</i>

611
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,627
- <i>Bye, babes.</i>
- Bye!

612
00:41:24,156 --> 00:41:28,011
- Fascinating exchange.
- How can men move on so quickly?

613
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:30,534
- What?
- It's like a switch for you, isn't it?

614
00:41:30,634 --> 00:41:32,606
You flip it off,
then you turn to the next one.

615
00:41:32,706 --> 00:41:35,898
You flip that one on, and when you
get tired of that, you just flip another.

616
00:41:35,998 --> 00:41:39,848
Like a pilot on a cockpit.
Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip.

617
00:41:39,948 --> 00:41:42,314
What the hell are you talking about?

618
00:41:42,414 --> 00:41:44,856
Wishful thinking, Richard.
I wish I was like...

619
00:41:44,956 --> 00:41:48,273
Eyes on the road, eyes on the road!
Do not enter! Wrong way! Wrong way!

620
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:51,339
- Oh, relax. Relax.
- I am, I am very relaxed.

621
00:41:51,439 --> 00:41:53,778
You're like an old lady!

622
00:41:54,514 --> 00:41:58,523
You men, you'd rather just go out there

623
00:41:58,623 --> 00:42:02,331
and have sex than work things out.

624
00:42:02,431 --> 00:42:04,139
Yeah. Guilty as charged.

625
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:09,174
But your horniness is nothing
but a big mask for you to hide behind.

626
00:42:09,274 --> 00:42:12,639
- Now, what's wrong with a big mask?
- Let me ask you something.

627
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:16,989
How can you teach the Romantics
when you can't even have a real feeling?

628
00:42:17,089 --> 00:42:18,873
Is irritation a real feeling?

629
00:42:18,973 --> 00:42:22,782
I mean, listening to you flirt on the phone
with some guy who's calling you babes,

630
00:42:22,882 --> 00:42:25,464
- oohing and ahhing. No...
- Please. I wasn't oohing and ahhing.

631
00:42:25,564 --> 00:42:30,056
I like it gentle. Good Lord, anyone
would think you were having an orgasm.

632
00:42:30,156 --> 00:42:32,539
I do not sound like that when I...

633
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:37,531
Anyway, you should hear some of the stupid
noises you guys make when you're...

634
00:42:38,031 --> 00:42:42,073
You can't even say the word, can you?
Come on. What do we sound like?

635
00:42:42,573 --> 00:42:45,014
For example, you have the bear.

636
00:42:51,473 --> 00:42:52,481
I can see your tonsils.

637
00:42:52,581 --> 00:42:54,747
- Then you have the sports commentators.
- Oh, yeah?

638
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:59,906
<i>Baja la pelota, recibe con el pecho,
mete mano en el área chica. Gol!</i>

639
00:43:01,056 --> 00:43:05,185
- What kind of men have you been with?
- And then there's the quiet ones.

640
00:43:09,573 --> 00:43:10,881
- Are you finished?
- No.

641
00:43:10,981 --> 00:43:14,355
- Of course not.
- And the worst one is the Tourette's one.

642
00:43:14,455 --> 00:43:17,006
- What?
- You know, "Shit, fuck.

643
00:43:17,106 --> 00:43:20,931
I love you, fuck me, oh,
motherfucker bitch, I love you.

644
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:23,831
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me."

645
00:43:23,931 --> 00:43:26,053
Hey, that sounds like you, Dad.

646
00:43:27,848 --> 00:43:29,973
I heard him once on the walkie-talkie.

647
00:43:30,073 --> 00:43:32,581
Mr. Haig, do you have a minute?

648
00:43:32,681 --> 00:43:36,786
Of course I do.
Come on, toots. This way.

649
00:43:36,886 --> 00:43:40,706
This morning, Jake said
he had a question about the rules.

650
00:43:40,806 --> 00:43:44,872
He asked if he was allowed to use
the special alphabet.

651
00:43:44,972 --> 00:43:47,277
- Oh, boy.
- I didn't know what that was.

652
00:43:47,377 --> 00:43:51,714
So he asked if he was allowed
to say the "A" word.

653
00:43:52,014 --> 00:43:55,356
Then he asked,
"Can I say bugger, crap, dummy?"

654
00:43:55,456 --> 00:43:58,314
And when he got to F, he said,
"Am I allowed to say 'frick,'

655
00:43:58,414 --> 00:44:00,802
because I know I'm not allowed
to say 'fuck.'"

656
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:04,793
It was at that point that I sent him
to the principal's office.

657
00:44:09,622 --> 00:44:13,514
- And what did you say for G?
- Goddamn.

658
00:44:13,614 --> 00:44:15,099
Mr. Haig,

659
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:20,395
how is Jake adjusting to your new...
living situation?

660
00:44:21,764 --> 00:44:25,689
No, no, this is not what it looks like,
or what it sounds like. No, no, no.

661
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:29,314
- We don't need to have an explanation.
- I think there's been a misunderstanding.

662
00:44:29,414 --> 00:44:32,151
- I would never...
- You've said enough.

663
00:44:38,472 --> 00:44:40,616
Oh, wonderful.

664
00:44:40,716 --> 00:44:43,427
I'll walk to the curb. Mind your hands.

665
00:44:43,527 --> 00:44:46,650
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

666
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:50,256
I'm just going to get
some delicious Potatoes Latinos.

667
00:44:51,341 --> 00:44:54,351
Yeah, and maybe a manicure.

668
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:56,662
Or a bikini wax.

669
00:44:56,762 --> 00:44:59,472
Bye. I'll see you later. You take care.

670
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:02,393
- Whatever.
- Bye.

671
00:45:05,947 --> 00:45:10,064
We have two new members today.
We have Cindy and Richard.

672
00:45:10,164 --> 00:45:11,651
So, Cindy, do you want to...

673
00:45:14,514 --> 00:45:16,689
Hi, I'm Cindy.

674
00:45:16,989 --> 00:45:19,726
And I'm an alcoholic.

675
00:45:22,372 --> 00:45:25,347
Thank you, Cindy. Richard?

676
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:30,847
Hi, I am Richard,
and I'm not an alcoholic.

677
00:45:30,947 --> 00:45:35,622
I'm English, a country with...
a few thousand years of history,

678
00:45:35,722 --> 00:45:38,647
and part of that history
is the communal practice

679
00:45:38,747 --> 00:45:40,822
of having a drink in the pub.

680
00:45:40,922 --> 00:45:45,231
Now, I know it's not your fault
a few sad, sorry pilgrims arrived here

681
00:45:45,331 --> 00:45:50,147
and infected your country with the message
of puritanical masochism.

682
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:54,972
But it is your fault you've all taken it
on board quite so earnestly.

683
00:45:55,072 --> 00:45:59,056
So... you chaps go ahead.

684
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:01,372
Knock yourselves out.

685
00:46:01,472 --> 00:46:04,822
But just know this. The first thing
I intend to do when this hour is up:

686
00:46:05,222 --> 00:46:08,171
is hit that bar across the street
and have a nice cold one.

687
00:46:08,989 --> 00:46:11,860
- Good luck with that.
- Thank you, Chad.

688
00:46:20,031 --> 00:46:22,647
How are the Romantics relevant to you?

689
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:26,322
You know, the only reason I'm taking
this class is so I can get my GPA up

690
00:46:26,422 --> 00:46:29,985
so I can play baseball
at Arizona State, so...

691
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:33,492
How about you, Stacy?

692
00:46:33,592 --> 00:46:35,901
How are the Romantics relevant to you?

693
00:46:36,514 --> 00:46:37,926
They're not.

694
00:46:43,472 --> 00:46:45,513
You have been such a wonderful audience.

695
00:46:45,613 --> 00:46:47,327
I can't wait to see you all next week,

696
00:46:47,427 --> 00:46:51,326
when I shall be lecturing naked,
wearing a sombrero.

697
00:46:51,426 --> 00:46:53,810
It'll be so wonderful.

698
00:46:56,656 --> 00:46:58,460
Fuck me.

699
00:47:00,572 --> 00:47:02,213
Olivia?

700
00:47:02,313 --> 00:47:05,581
- Hey, babes! There you are!
- Oh, Tim! Hi!

701
00:47:05,681 --> 00:47:07,760
How are you, beautiful?

702
00:47:10,047 --> 00:47:11,762
Okay.

703
00:47:12,477 --> 00:47:14,563
About this.

704
00:47:15,155 --> 00:47:16,756
This rocks.

705
00:47:16,856 --> 00:47:19,221
- Really?
- It is smart, it is funny.

706
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:21,321
- Oh, I love Jenna.
- Jane.

707
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:25,025
You might want to change that. Sex sells.
Jane makes me think of nun in a wimple.

708
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:26,542
God, but you are so talented.

709
00:47:26,692 --> 00:47:29,517
You're so beautiful, too.
And trust me, that helps, babe.

710
00:47:29,617 --> 00:47:32,492
I'm gonna take you to the stars.
I am gonna take you to the stars.

711
00:47:32,592 --> 00:47:35,759
All I ask is that these shoulders
be the ones you stand upon.

712
00:47:35,859 --> 00:47:37,250
Watch the silk, though?

713
00:47:42,434 --> 00:47:43,169
Hello?

714
00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:45,945
Richard, listen. They've assigned
your case for investigation.

715
00:47:46,045 --> 00:47:47,775
Really? What does that mean?

716
00:47:47,875 --> 00:47:50,159
You're under surveillance
by an undercover federal agent.

717
00:47:50,259 --> 00:47:51,907
- <i>Jesus! Fuck!</i>
- Yes.

718
00:47:52,007 --> 00:47:53,418
<i>Sorry. Sorry.</i>

719
00:47:54,884 --> 00:47:57,992
Shit. He's here tonight.
He just flashed his badge.

720
00:47:58,092 --> 00:47:59,617
Don't fumble the ball, now!

721
00:47:59,717 --> 00:48:02,892
<i>All that matters is that you exhibit
good moral character, okay?</i>

722
00:48:02,992 --> 00:48:05,305
Okay, everybody, grab a seat.

723
00:48:05,405 --> 00:48:09,259
Okay, so, Chad, I believe
you wanted to start us off?

724
00:48:09,659 --> 00:48:12,526
I'm Chad, and I am 13 days sober.

725
00:48:12,626 --> 00:48:16,019
- Yeah! Way to go, Chad!
- All right, Chad!

726
00:48:16,534 --> 00:48:20,992
All right, so why don't you tell us
how that feels?

727
00:48:21,092 --> 00:48:23,950
Well, you know,
it started by not going...

728
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:27,892
Wendy? Excuse me, Wendy,
just a moment there, please.

729
00:48:27,992 --> 00:48:29,809
Sorry, everyone. Can I say something?

730
00:48:29,909 --> 00:48:32,800
Sorry, Chad, I didn't mean to interrupt
your moment of glory there.

731
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,281
My name is Richard,

732
00:48:35,397 --> 00:48:40,325
and I'd like to amend my earlier comments
about the drinking habits of the English.

733
00:48:40,825 --> 00:48:44,655
I mean, just because the entire country
hits the pub after work doesn't mean

734
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,992
we can't all be alcoholics,
because we are.

735
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:51,842
We are inebriates, national disgrace.

736
00:48:51,942 --> 00:48:55,489
What else? I'm married, very happily so.

737
00:48:55,589 --> 00:48:58,359
Oh, and I have a son.
A beautiful little son called Jakey.

738
00:48:58,459 --> 00:49:03,642
Born here, in this country, a country which
I love and has such meaning to my heart.

739
00:49:03,742 --> 00:49:05,356
So, Richard...

740
00:49:05,806 --> 00:49:08,243
with all of that to lose,

741
00:49:08,343 --> 00:49:13,245
why would you get drunk
and then get behind the wheel of a car?

742
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:21,843
Yep. Well, there you have it.
I'm an alcoholic.

743
00:49:22,367 --> 00:49:25,021
I'm Richard, alcoholic.

744
00:49:31,734 --> 00:49:36,725
Yeah? Jakey? Jake, no, no, no.
No, Jakey, just tell him...

745
00:49:36,825 --> 00:49:38,460
Just tell him...

746
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,642
Tell him just to calm down.

747
00:49:40,742 --> 00:49:43,201
Okay, no more cellphones.

748
00:49:44,934 --> 00:49:47,025
I'm here, I'm here. It's okay.

749
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:51,054
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
- It's all right. Don't worry. Don't worry.

750
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:56,704
I know. I know. Come on, Jakey, calm down.
Calm down. Just breathe. There you go.

751
00:49:57,417 --> 00:50:00,107
Breathe, breathe, relax.

752
00:50:00,207 --> 00:50:03,442
- Use your words.
- I... I had a bad dream.

753
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,146
- Okay.
- Then I woke up...

754
00:50:05,246 --> 00:50:08,929
and Mommy wasn't here,
and you were gone and...

755
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:12,072
I'm really sorry. Okay.

756
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:15,075
Hey, you know what we're gonna do?

757
00:50:15,175 --> 00:50:18,679
We're gonna blow
that bad dream away, okay?

758
00:50:28,975 --> 00:50:31,204
Here, let me catch it.

759
00:50:37,092 --> 00:50:41,034
Okay. Give us a hug.
All right, where's Teddy?

760
00:50:42,065 --> 00:50:43,866
There he is!

761
00:50:46,992 --> 00:50:50,214
All right, let's go to sleep.
Come on, say good night.

762
00:50:50,314 --> 00:50:51,382
Good night.

763
00:51:03,367 --> 00:51:07,742
There you go, my little warrior poet.
Go to sleep.

764
00:51:07,842 --> 00:51:13,662
Dad, you and Mom are never going
to live together, are you?

765
00:51:14,967 --> 00:51:17,725
No, I'm sorry.

766
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:20,992
But if you're ever upset about anything,

767
00:51:21,092 --> 00:51:25,703
anything at all, you go talk
to your mum or talk to me.

768
00:51:25,803 --> 00:51:28,125
Or Brian?

769
00:51:28,675 --> 00:51:31,512
Only if I'm stuck down a mine
and your mom's in a coma.

770
00:51:38,792 --> 00:51:41,825
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

771
00:51:41,925 --> 00:51:43,359
I...

772
00:51:43,459 --> 00:51:46,834
- I was completely useless.
- No, It's okay.

773
00:51:46,934 --> 00:51:49,650
I can't even take care
of my little sister's child.

774
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:52,725
I mean, how hard can that be, right?

775
00:51:52,825 --> 00:51:57,017
Have you ever felt like everybody else
has gotten their shit together but you?

776
00:51:57,117 --> 00:52:01,328
I mean, my little sister has.
Even you have.

777
00:52:01,428 --> 00:52:04,342
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

778
00:52:04,442 --> 00:52:07,905
Look, it's just a lot different
when it's your own kid.

779
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,179
Well, I wouldn't know about that either.

780
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,725
Listen, I made some soup.

781
00:52:14,825 --> 00:52:18,943
- Would you like some? It's horrible.
- Sure. I love horrible soup.

782
00:52:25,167 --> 00:52:28,113
It's horrible. I can't even make a soup.

783
00:52:28,213 --> 00:52:29,578
Oh, boy.

784
00:52:31,758 --> 00:52:35,942
- You know, you're a really good father.
- Yeah. Sure I am.

785
00:52:36,042 --> 00:52:39,767
Richard, I'm giving you a compliment.
Just say thank you.

786
00:52:40,193 --> 00:52:41,729
Thank you, Olivia.

787
00:52:43,758 --> 00:52:46,286
I like it when you say my name.

788
00:52:47,317 --> 00:52:49,315
It's funny.

789
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:53,812
Most women adore me to begin with,
and then end up hating me.

790
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:58,517
You, on the other hand, hated me right off
the bat, but now I think you despise me.

791
00:52:58,617 --> 00:53:02,250
No, I despised you at the beginning.

792
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:07,316
Now, I just loathe you
a little sometimes.

793
00:53:10,542 --> 00:53:12,354
Well.

794
00:53:36,375 --> 00:53:39,592
<i>I've been staying inside</i>

795
00:53:40,222 --> 00:53:43,405
<i>Watching from the outside</i>

796
00:53:43,905 --> 00:53:47,424
<i>My God, it's been a long time</i>

797
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,381
<i>For sure</i>

798
00:53:51,458 --> 00:53:54,931
<i>I've been reaching for my west side</i>

799
00:53:55,308 --> 00:53:58,850
<i>'Cause it used to be my best side</i>

800
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:02,144
<i>Now it's a part of me I can't find</i>

801
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:05,072
<i>Anymore</i>

802
00:54:07,325 --> 00:54:09,768
<i>I wanna fly...</i>

803
00:54:11,591 --> 00:54:16,216
I packed your toothbrush, your pajamas,

804
00:54:16,316 --> 00:54:17,883
and...

805
00:54:18,333 --> 00:54:20,791
Hey, guys, what's happening?

806
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:22,500
- Where you going?
- My sleepover!

807
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,066
Oh, yeah! The sleepover,
of course. All right.

808
00:54:25,166 --> 00:54:29,075
Well, give me a kiss and have
a good night. There you go, soldier.

809
00:54:29,175 --> 00:54:30,816
- Cool!
- Have fun, Jakey!

810
00:54:30,916 --> 00:54:33,458
- Let's go.
- Good night.

811
00:54:33,558 --> 00:54:35,837
Enjoy your night off.

812
00:55:12,925 --> 00:55:14,595
Hello?

813
00:55:17,091 --> 00:55:20,920
Oh, there he is! What's up, Rich?

814
00:55:21,366 --> 00:55:23,204
Hi, Richard!

815
00:55:25,466 --> 00:55:27,725
Yeah, great, well done.

816
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:31,512
Leaving now. Yeah, good.
Sorry about that.

817
00:55:34,341 --> 00:55:35,516
Yeah.

818
00:55:37,066 --> 00:55:39,173
He's a little weird.

819
00:55:40,616 --> 00:55:43,825
- Bye!
- Hey, I'll be back for more?

820
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:45,987
Bye, babes!

821
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,621
Had to leave early, did he?

822
00:55:49,433 --> 00:55:52,868
Well, he did stay
until he got the job done.

823
00:55:52,968 --> 00:55:56,433
- That was good of him.
- Yeah, he's gonna come back tomorrow

824
00:55:56,533 --> 00:55:59,191
and bring a friend
so we can all do it together.

825
00:55:59,291 --> 00:56:01,757
- The more the merrier.
- For Christ's sake.

826
00:56:01,857 --> 00:56:05,171
We were working,
and then he went surfing, you idiot.

827
00:56:05,271 --> 00:56:08,884
Now where is that bottle of wine?
I could use a drink.

828
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:13,104
Come on up.

829
00:56:23,091 --> 00:56:24,354
There you go.

830
00:56:25,741 --> 00:56:29,520
- Apology accepted.
- Oh, good.

831
00:56:29,758 --> 00:56:32,987
- To friends.
- To friends.

832
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:40,825
A bit old for homework, aren't you?

833
00:56:40,925 --> 00:56:45,662
Well, it's never too late to perfect
new ways of boring one's students.

834
00:56:47,841 --> 00:56:52,033
So... must be very excited
to have Tim all over you.

835
00:56:52,133 --> 00:56:54,945
So to speak. About your book.

836
00:56:56,408 --> 00:56:58,171
Well...

837
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:01,868
tonight he tore me to pieces.

838
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:04,250
It's hard to be judged by others.

839
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:08,456
It's very difficult...
to stay true to your own voice

840
00:57:08,556 --> 00:57:12,087
when everybody else
wants you to do something else.

841
00:57:13,658 --> 00:57:15,591
It made me think of Alan.

842
00:57:16,091 --> 00:57:19,275
All the notes that I gave him
through the years.

843
00:57:19,375 --> 00:57:21,725
It must have tortured him.

844
00:57:21,825 --> 00:57:24,120
So it's not all bad, then.

845
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,458
I'll be honest, I always thought
he was an arrogant little shit

846
00:57:29,558 --> 00:57:32,254
whose books were vapid and hackneyed.

847
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:36,511
And all I could ever think about
when I skim-read them...

848
00:57:38,147 --> 00:57:41,008
- was you.
- Me?

849
00:57:41,529 --> 00:57:42,906
You.

850
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,249
Yes.

851
00:57:45,349 --> 00:57:46,683
And what could have been worse?

852
00:57:46,783 --> 00:57:51,837
Being married to him
or editing his schmaltzy drivel?

853
00:57:53,924 --> 00:57:56,637
They both sucked.

854
00:57:58,674 --> 00:58:01,120
Do you know who he's screwing?

855
00:58:01,674 --> 00:58:04,420
My gynecologist.

856
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:07,033
My gynecologist!

857
00:58:07,133 --> 00:58:08,570
I mean,

858
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:12,291
I actually thought that he was coming
to our appointments because he cared,

859
00:58:12,391 --> 00:58:14,599
but no, he wanted to see the doctor.

860
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:17,391
Maybe you're better off without him.

861
00:58:17,491 --> 00:58:19,558
Think about it.

862
00:58:19,658 --> 00:58:24,049
You're smart, you're funny,
you're beautiful, terrible driver, but...

863
00:58:24,749 --> 00:58:27,845
I'm sure you'll find someone
to overlook that.

864
00:58:28,216 --> 00:58:30,291
You're just saying that.

865
00:58:30,391 --> 00:58:34,094
Well, you are smart, you are funny,

866
00:58:34,194 --> 00:58:37,220
and you are very, very beautiful.

867
00:59:32,933 --> 00:59:34,906
- What the hell happened to my car?
- Oh, shit.

868
00:59:35,006 --> 00:59:38,966
Oh, my nuts! They said they
weren't coming back until tonight!

869
00:59:39,066 --> 00:59:42,878
- It's a good thing it's a military vehicle.
- Oh, my God!

870
00:59:43,424 --> 00:59:47,323
Okay, okay. To the house. To the house.

871
00:59:50,793 --> 00:59:54,903
- <i>Buenos días, Pedro.</i>
- <i>Buenos días, señora.</i>

872
00:59:58,699 --> 01:00:00,658
Get the keys, sweetie.

873
01:00:00,758 --> 01:00:04,187
Oh, you know what,
I think I left my phone in the car.

874
01:00:15,674 --> 01:00:17,708
- Hi!
- You're naked.

875
01:00:17,808 --> 01:00:21,263
If you're wondering where Jake is,
he's at a sleepover with Josh.

876
01:00:21,533 --> 01:00:24,683
- Why are you naked?
- Richard's sleeping in his house.

877
01:00:24,783 --> 01:00:27,812
- I'm just gonna go and swim.
- Unbelievable.

878
01:00:30,991 --> 01:00:33,349
Hey, how's the lecture coming?

879
01:00:33,449 --> 01:00:36,594
I've passed kidney stones
with greater ease.

880
01:00:37,349 --> 01:00:41,958
Well, don't overthink it.
Just be honest, pithy, simple.

881
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:47,349
You know something? I think you're the first
woman I've ever really been friends with.

882
01:00:47,449 --> 01:00:50,108
Well, that's a little sad, Richard,
but very touching.

883
01:00:50,208 --> 01:00:53,645
What brought about this sudden
onset of sincerity?

884
01:00:56,266 --> 01:00:59,113
I slept with someone,

885
01:00:59,213 --> 01:01:00,829
and...

886
01:01:01,413 --> 01:01:03,766
it actually meant something.

887
01:01:03,966 --> 01:01:06,484
Well, that's great. Who?

888
01:01:06,584 --> 01:01:08,287
Olivia.

889
01:01:09,466 --> 01:01:13,738
Are you kidding? Richard, why don't you go
down to your Green Card appointment,

890
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:16,699
take out your samurai sword,
and disembowel yourself?

891
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:19,998
What is wrong with you?
Are you trying to get deported?

892
01:01:20,098 --> 01:01:23,416
- I mean, Kate is going to kill you!
- Kate's not going to know about it, is she?

893
01:01:23,516 --> 01:01:25,674
I mean, I'm not going to tell her,
and Olivia's not going to tell her.

894
01:01:25,774 --> 01:01:30,486
They are sisters, Richard,
close sisters, and close sisters talk.

895
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:36,611
You better move.

896
01:01:46,841 --> 01:01:49,461
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

897
01:01:56,904 --> 01:01:58,091
- Kate, hi.
- Hey!

898
01:01:58,191 --> 01:02:01,316
- How's everything? Good?
- Olivia told me everything.

899
01:02:01,516 --> 01:02:03,582
Oh, she did?

900
01:02:03,682 --> 01:02:06,545
I think it's awesome
that she started writing.

901
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:10,974
And she said you were really nice
to her when I was away.

902
01:02:11,074 --> 01:02:13,424
Oh, wonderful.

903
01:02:13,924 --> 01:02:17,629
You know... I know I've been
kind of a bitch to you lately.

904
01:02:17,729 --> 01:02:18,713
Oh, that's okay.

905
01:02:18,813 --> 01:02:23,299
Threatening not to come to your green card
meeting was totally out of line. I'm sorry.

906
01:02:23,399 --> 01:02:26,474
Yeah, live and let live,
forgive and forget, all of that.

907
01:02:26,574 --> 01:02:28,999
- We're cool?
- We are so cool.

908
01:02:29,099 --> 01:02:31,624
Okay. Do you want
to get me some lemonade?

909
01:02:31,724 --> 01:02:32,943
- Good idea.
- Thanks.

910
01:02:33,043 --> 01:02:35,720
Okay. Great.

911
01:02:45,466 --> 01:02:47,445
You smoke?

912
01:02:52,216 --> 01:02:56,045
- I can't stop thinking about last night.
- Nor can I.

913
01:02:57,824 --> 01:02:59,866
- We have to tell her.
- No, no, no.

914
01:02:59,966 --> 01:03:02,172
- This is not good timing. Olivia, Olivia.
- Dad?

915
01:03:02,272 --> 01:03:04,482
That's gone to your head. Get back
in the bush. Get behind the bush.

916
01:03:04,582 --> 01:03:07,741
There's a funny old man here
that wants to see you.

917
01:03:07,841 --> 01:03:09,495
What?

918
01:03:10,449 --> 01:03:12,246
Dad, what are you doing here?

919
01:03:12,349 --> 01:03:16,632
Why in buggering hell
have you been ignoring my calls?

920
01:03:17,232 --> 01:03:20,911
Oh, hello, this must be the Yank totty!

921
01:03:21,011 --> 01:03:23,370
Kate, my father.

922
01:03:24,007 --> 01:03:26,166
Oh, my goodness, Mr. Haig!

923
01:03:26,266 --> 01:03:29,357
It's so nice to meet you!

924
01:03:29,457 --> 01:03:32,782
- Sorry, I'm soaking wet.
- I need a shower anyway.

925
01:03:32,882 --> 01:03:36,074
Oh, and who is this other vision
of loveliness?

926
01:03:36,174 --> 01:03:39,741
I'm Olivia. I'm Kate's sister.

927
01:03:39,841 --> 01:03:42,174
Blimey. Bookends.

928
01:03:42,574 --> 01:03:45,183
Well, come inside,
I'll make you up a room.

929
01:03:45,283 --> 01:03:47,851
No, no, no, it's okay. Dad, come with me.
Come to the guesthouse.

930
01:03:47,951 --> 01:03:51,216
- We've got plenty of rooms.
- No, that's okay. Dad, come with me.

931
01:03:51,316 --> 01:03:53,749
- Are you sure?
- You're staying with me. I promise you.

932
01:03:53,849 --> 01:03:55,966
- Nice to meet you!
- You too!

933
01:03:56,066 --> 01:04:00,888
- Why exactly are you here?
- I'm visiting you and the little turd...

934
01:04:00,988 --> 01:04:06,824
- Fella. What's it bloody look like?
- Well, I don't really know. I mean...

935
01:04:06,924 --> 01:04:09,489
Jake, meet your grandfather.

936
01:04:09,589 --> 01:04:11,736
Yeah. I'm your granddad.

937
01:04:11,836 --> 01:04:14,791
I've got something for you
that I brought all the way from England.

938
01:04:14,891 --> 01:04:20,629
Would you like to see it?
Now that is a model of "HMS Defiance."

939
01:04:20,729 --> 01:04:23,057
God, Dad. You never let me
used to touch that.

940
01:04:23,157 --> 01:04:25,475
- What?
- Okay, I'll be right back.

941
01:04:25,575 --> 01:04:27,991
Hey! Wait a minute, where are you going?

942
01:04:28,091 --> 01:04:31,232
You can't bear to be in the same room
with me for two minutes, is that it?

943
01:04:31,332 --> 01:04:34,257
- No, that's not it, Dad, not at all!
- Can I keep it?

944
01:04:34,557 --> 01:04:37,599
Of course you can bloody keep it.
It's yours!

945
01:04:37,699 --> 01:04:41,694
But don't put it in the bath,
because it'll sink.

946
01:04:44,764 --> 01:04:47,057
- Hey, cool!
- Where should we put it? Here?

947
01:04:47,157 --> 01:04:49,728
- On the top!
- Yes, on the top!

948
01:04:51,632 --> 01:04:53,690
Hello, my lovelies.

949
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:57,719
All I'm asking is, can you wait
till Monday morning at 11:00?

950
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:00,307
Why?

951
01:05:00,407 --> 01:05:02,711
My green card interview.

952
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:05,916
After that...

953
01:05:06,016 --> 01:05:07,991
you can...

954
01:05:08,632 --> 01:05:10,928
tell her what you like, okay?

955
01:05:29,165 --> 01:05:30,821
Dad...

956
01:05:31,432 --> 01:05:34,399
- I need to go pee.
- Come on, then.

957
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:37,915
Hey, where the bloody hell
are you two going? Come on, hey!

958
01:05:38,015 --> 01:05:42,157
- We're going to go for a pee, Dad.
- Come on, whip it out. Come on!

959
01:05:42,257 --> 01:05:45,704
- Dad, you can't pee off the pier.
- Jake, who are you going to listen to?

960
01:05:45,804 --> 01:05:50,414
Your dad, who, for some buggering reason
has turned into a boring old fart,

961
01:05:50,514 --> 01:05:53,890
or your grandfather,
who's lived a rich and full life

962
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:56,628
and doesn't take shite from anybody?

963
01:05:58,674 --> 01:06:01,157
You! Sorry, Dad.

964
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:05,410
There you go, come on up here.
There you go. Up you go.

965
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:09,740
Come on, you too.
If you're still my son, that is.

966
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:14,297
All right, on three. One, two, three.

967
01:06:14,397 --> 01:06:17,403
Yeah! That's it.

968
01:06:22,432 --> 01:06:26,573
Well, somebody had
their vitamins this morning.

969
01:06:28,674 --> 01:06:31,365
You know, there are coconuts over there!

970
01:06:31,465 --> 01:06:33,657
Great isn't it? There you go.

971
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:38,649
Beautiful. Oh, dear.
All right, all right, all right.

972
01:06:38,749 --> 01:06:42,707
That's good stuff.
Put on some tunes, guys?

973
01:06:43,207 --> 01:06:47,849
Oh, look at this. This is paradise, man.
You've ended up in paradise!

974
01:06:47,949 --> 01:06:51,294
You know, they must be freezing
their bollocks off in England.

975
01:06:54,215 --> 01:06:56,611
Why are you really here?

976
01:07:03,532 --> 01:07:07,819
Joan left me. Silly cow.

977
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:12,565
Well, I'm sorry. Truly.

978
01:07:13,431 --> 01:07:18,157
Well, that makes me feel so much better.

979
01:07:18,257 --> 01:07:23,290
I mean, God almighty, thank you
for those profound words of sympathy.

980
01:07:23,390 --> 01:07:26,374
Well, it's a lot more than you
ever said when Kate left me.

981
01:07:26,474 --> 01:07:28,386
Well, I warned you about her!

982
01:07:28,486 --> 01:07:31,069
She was a rampant little Yankee trollop.

983
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:35,537
You know what, Dad?
Of course Joan left you.

984
01:07:35,637 --> 01:07:39,574
You're a misanthropic, misogynistic asshole
who doesn't give a fuck about anybody,

985
01:07:39,674 --> 01:07:44,074
least of all the poor saps who you got
to marry you in the first place.

986
01:07:44,174 --> 01:07:47,557
Is that it? Is that all you've got?

987
01:07:47,657 --> 01:07:52,015
And you did it all in the name
of some misguided credo called fun.

988
01:07:52,115 --> 01:07:54,232
Which you brainwashed me
with in the first place.

989
01:07:54,332 --> 01:07:56,935
Guys, dig this song!

990
01:07:57,215 --> 01:07:58,310
Bugger off.

991
01:08:01,674 --> 01:08:04,115
That's it then, is it, boy wonder?

992
01:08:04,215 --> 01:08:07,987
So you finally got it
off your chest, have you?

993
01:08:08,087 --> 01:08:10,237
You know what, Dad?

994
01:08:10,757 --> 01:08:13,522
Why don't you just bugger off for once?

995
01:08:13,682 --> 01:08:15,225
For once...

996
01:08:15,325 --> 01:08:18,755
why don't you be the one to bugger off?

997
01:08:48,623 --> 01:08:51,407
Brian, go back to my wife.

998
01:08:51,757 --> 01:08:53,498
Go on.

999
01:08:53,598 --> 01:08:57,167
Go on, just... just go back.

1000
01:08:57,267 --> 01:08:59,282
Thank you for that wonderful sharing.

1001
01:08:59,382 --> 01:09:03,648
Seriously, this has been
absolutely a marvelous session.

1002
01:09:03,798 --> 01:09:07,173
I've learned so much.
Give yourselves a big hand. Everybody.

1003
01:09:07,273 --> 01:09:09,890
Wendy, I was wondering
if you could sign my form

1004
01:09:09,990 --> 01:09:12,599
to show that I've done the 10 sessions?

1005
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:16,611
I'm sorry, Richard, I can't.

1006
01:09:18,215 --> 01:09:22,880
Why? I mean, I came,
I did the whole "I'm an alcoholic..."

1007
01:09:23,257 --> 01:09:26,473
But it's not about
just saying the words.

1008
01:09:26,573 --> 01:09:29,627
You have to actually mean them.

1009
01:09:35,707 --> 01:09:38,247
Great seeing you. Thanks so much.

1010
01:09:40,882 --> 01:09:43,007
Cindy, right?

1011
01:09:43,107 --> 01:09:46,557
I just spent the last week listening
to that drivel so some witless little ninny

1012
01:09:46,657 --> 01:09:49,648
won't sign a piece of paper
to say I'm an okay kind of guy.

1013
01:09:49,748 --> 01:09:53,161
Absolute bollocks. Sorry, excuse me.

1014
01:09:54,090 --> 01:09:56,332
Hey, you want to get a drink?
Actually, maybe not.

1015
01:09:56,432 --> 01:09:59,048
I've got a grueling lecture in an hour.

1016
01:09:59,148 --> 01:10:02,007
How about a joint?
Just kidding, bad joke.

1017
01:10:02,107 --> 01:10:06,315
I didn't want my son to find it.
I don't touch the stuff. It's my dad's.

1018
01:10:06,715 --> 01:10:08,586
Likes to puff.

1019
01:10:09,248 --> 01:10:12,661
- Good luck with your lecture.
- Thank you.

1020
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:23,907
I want you all to imagine
you're at Cambridge University.

1021
01:10:24,007 --> 01:10:26,336
The year is 1807.

1022
01:10:26,448 --> 01:10:28,692
You walk across the quad
of Trinity College.

1023
01:10:28,792 --> 01:10:33,157
Into the lecture hall, you find
your fellow classmate, Lord Byron,

1024
01:10:33,257 --> 01:10:37,970
who, in defiance
of college rules about dogs,

1025
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:41,218
has brought a bear to class instead.

1026
01:10:55,823 --> 01:10:58,026
You know what?

1027
01:10:58,632 --> 01:11:00,508
Forget about that.

1028
01:11:00,608 --> 01:11:04,386
Why are the Romantics relevant today?

1029
01:11:07,698 --> 01:11:09,470
Honestly...

1030
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:11,267
they're not.

1031
01:11:12,715 --> 01:11:14,623
Stacy got it right.

1032
01:11:14,723 --> 01:11:18,865
And Dwight, he can't stop thinking
about home runs and fastballs

1033
01:11:18,965 --> 01:11:21,661
when he reads Byron and Coleridge.

1034
01:11:25,548 --> 01:11:27,229
Because...

1035
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:30,071
we're teaching words.

1036
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:32,832
Words.

1037
01:11:33,632 --> 01:11:36,177
But we're not teaching meaning.

1038
01:11:37,757 --> 01:11:39,820
I got it all wrong.

1039
01:11:40,265 --> 01:11:44,723
I can tell you about Byron and his bear,
Wordsworth falling in love with his cousin,

1040
01:11:44,823 --> 01:11:48,165
Coleridge falling in love with cocaine.

1041
01:11:48,265 --> 01:11:51,140
I can tell you what's behind
the words from them,

1042
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:55,148
but I can't tell you what's behind
those words for you.

1043
01:11:56,048 --> 01:11:59,598
Because this class is about you

1044
01:11:59,698 --> 01:12:02,304
learning to find your own meaning.

1045
01:12:03,631 --> 01:12:05,727
Your own voices.

1046
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:11,790
Go read the poems.
But know this, that at this moment,

1047
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:16,906
you are the Romantics,
you are the relevant ones.

1048
01:12:17,006 --> 01:12:21,457
Let Byron, Coleridge, Wordsworth
inspire you to do your thing,

1049
01:12:21,557 --> 01:12:23,298
to go your own way.

1050
01:12:23,398 --> 01:12:26,348
Stacy, quit texting.
Call him, right now.

1051
01:12:26,798 --> 01:12:30,823
Dwight, go play ball.
Ignore anyone who says no, you can't.

1052
01:12:30,923 --> 01:12:35,454
Follow your hearts. Do good things,
be bold, and, above all else...

1053
01:12:36,754 --> 01:12:38,635
stick it to the man.

1054
01:12:41,556 --> 01:12:44,773
Well, Dad, I totally fucked up
my audition lecture.

1055
01:12:44,873 --> 01:12:49,115
I stuck it to them all right.
I stuck it to myself in the process, too.

1056
01:12:49,215 --> 01:12:53,698
Hey, listen, you silly old sod,
you just bolted before I could apologize.

1057
01:12:53,798 --> 01:12:56,823
Why are you so thin-skinned these days?

1058
01:12:56,923 --> 01:12:59,610
All right, call me back.

1059
01:13:14,531 --> 01:13:17,565
$4,000 should cover it.

1060
01:13:17,665 --> 01:13:18,821
What?

1061
01:13:18,921 --> 01:13:23,215
Your Mustang, Richard, it's got Sienna Red
paint there all over the back fender.

1062
01:13:23,315 --> 01:13:25,248
Unmistakable.

1063
01:13:25,348 --> 01:13:29,118
1954 MG TFs do not come cheap,
my friend.

1064
01:13:29,218 --> 01:13:31,598
Absolutely not. Can I give you a check?

1065
01:13:31,698 --> 01:13:33,710
I would prefer cash.

1066
01:13:37,215 --> 01:13:39,948
Wanted to be the first
to congratulate you.

1067
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:43,156
Welcome to the English department,
University of Los Angeles.

1068
01:13:43,256 --> 01:13:45,290
Yes!

1069
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:48,248
Oh, good. Oh, thank you, boss.

1070
01:13:48,348 --> 01:13:50,515
I guess we'll do the other side as well.

1071
01:13:50,615 --> 01:13:53,031
- Let's go have a pint.
- A pint of what? Oil?

1072
01:13:53,131 --> 01:13:57,202
A pint of what... Witty.
I'll always laugh at your jokes.

1073
01:14:05,615 --> 01:14:08,912
I got the job. ULA!
Knocked it out of the ballpark.

1074
01:14:09,012 --> 01:14:11,826
- Congratulations!
- Home run! Fantastic!

1075
01:14:11,926 --> 01:14:15,456
And I feel fantastic about you
and what we did, making love.

1076
01:14:15,556 --> 01:14:17,115
No, listen please. Hear me out.

1077
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:19,585
Kate and I have been separated
for two years.

1078
01:14:19,685 --> 01:14:22,623
Why should we feel bad?
We're grownups, you know.

1079
01:14:22,723 --> 01:14:26,743
And if Kate doesn't like it, she can
bloody well just go... Hey, you. Brian.

1080
01:14:26,843 --> 01:14:30,110
Okay, okay, in the vault.

1081
01:14:32,215 --> 01:14:34,303
Oh, Kate.

1082
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:38,077
Olivia.

1083
01:14:39,081 --> 01:14:40,957
My best friend.

1084
01:14:41,923 --> 01:14:44,556
Total trust.

1085
01:14:44,656 --> 01:14:46,690
No secrets!

1086
01:14:47,090 --> 01:14:51,048
- We were going to...
- You know what? If you want him, take him.

1087
01:14:51,448 --> 01:14:52,852
But get out of my house.

1088
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:57,119
Well, now, maybe... okay.

1089
01:15:31,448 --> 01:15:33,118
Thank you.

1090
01:15:33,673 --> 01:15:36,331
Ernesto. Sorry I'm late.

1091
01:15:36,839 --> 01:15:40,385
- Where's your wife?
- Not coming. Sends her regards.

1092
01:15:41,756 --> 01:15:44,148
Okay, strike one, she's not here.

1093
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:47,823
Strike two, you failed
the recovery program.

1094
01:15:47,923 --> 01:15:50,485
We may be 0-2, but we're going
to swing for the fences

1095
01:15:50,585 --> 01:15:52,923
on the University of Los Angeles.

1096
01:15:53,023 --> 01:15:53,978
Morning, officer Lewis.

1097
01:15:54,078 --> 01:15:57,131
Why has it taken nearly three years
to schedule this interview?

1098
01:15:57,231 --> 01:16:00,581
Well, my client never received
all the notifications from ICE.

1099
01:16:01,781 --> 01:16:04,656
Is this your handwriting, Mr. Haig?

1100
01:16:04,756 --> 01:16:08,531
Some of it is.
Some of it's also my son's.

1101
01:16:08,631 --> 01:16:10,856
Working on his cursive.

1102
01:16:10,956 --> 01:16:12,718
Can you explain this?

1103
01:16:13,089 --> 01:16:16,823
Yes, well, that's not my fault.
Painkillers, dental surgery.

1104
01:16:16,923 --> 01:16:20,359
My client's done 10 sessions of a recovery
program to show his good character.

1105
01:16:20,459 --> 01:16:23,998
Where's the letter of completion?
In the mail, with "bew-locks" written on it?

1106
01:16:24,698 --> 01:16:27,406
It's "bollocks," actually.

1107
01:16:27,506 --> 01:16:29,543
Officer Armstrong!

1108
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:39,983
Please describe how Mr. Haig
tried to offer you marijuana.

1109
01:16:41,798 --> 01:16:45,764
The other night, as I was leaving
the recovery center,

1110
01:16:45,864 --> 01:16:48,963
Mr. Haig asked me
if I wanted some marijuana.

1111
01:16:50,598 --> 01:16:55,878
Under California law, the possession
of marijuana is a felony.

1112
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:57,723
That's true.

1113
01:16:57,823 --> 01:17:00,059
What is it you say, Mr. Haig? Cheerios?

1114
01:17:02,006 --> 01:17:05,039
There you have it, the whole sorry saga.

1115
01:17:05,139 --> 01:17:09,873
Ernesto did do one thing
to justify his exorbitant fee.

1116
01:17:11,123 --> 01:17:13,598
He got me this one hour with you.

1117
01:17:14,448 --> 01:17:17,406
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Jake.

1118
01:17:17,506 --> 01:17:19,852
- Time's up.
- Jake, please.

1119
01:17:26,948 --> 01:17:29,302
I love you. Do you hear me?
I am so sorry.

1120
01:18:12,548 --> 01:18:14,932
"That is no country for old men.

1121
01:18:17,406 --> 01:18:20,656
The young in one another's arms,

1122
01:18:21,256 --> 01:18:23,114
birds in the trees,

1123
01:18:23,214 --> 01:18:27,043
those dying generations...
at their song."

1124
01:18:27,923 --> 01:18:29,873
So, what's Yeats saying here?

1125
01:18:29,973 --> 01:18:34,584
He's a 60-year-old man looking
at young people screwing and living,

1126
01:18:34,684 --> 01:18:37,701
blissfully unthinking
about their own mortality.

1127
01:18:38,131 --> 01:18:40,528
Yeats knows he's just an aged man,

1128
01:18:41,447 --> 01:18:44,067
but his dreams...

1129
01:18:44,167 --> 01:18:46,140
are of Byzantium.

1130
01:18:53,256 --> 01:18:54,974
- Hello?
- <i>This is Memorial General.</i>

1131
01:18:55,074 --> 01:18:57,757
<i>We need to talk to you
about your father.</i>

1132
01:19:33,089 --> 01:19:36,451
What the buggering hell
are you doing here?

1133
01:19:36,922 --> 01:19:39,247
You hate hospitals.

1134
01:19:39,447 --> 01:19:41,444
You're right.

1135
01:19:41,544 --> 01:19:44,319
I hate bloody hospitals.

1136
01:19:44,419 --> 01:19:47,318
But I love the nurses.

1137
01:19:53,256 --> 01:19:55,535
How's my little Jake?

1138
01:19:58,797 --> 01:20:01,101
He's all right, Dad.

1139
01:20:02,572 --> 01:20:04,628
You know, I...

1140
01:20:06,006 --> 01:20:09,285
I don't think I could have done
what you did.

1141
01:20:10,822 --> 01:20:15,535
You stuck with that boy
through all the muck and bullets.

1142
01:20:18,289 --> 01:20:21,254
You're a better man than I, Gunga Din.

1143
01:20:26,547 --> 01:20:28,960
I don't know about that, Dad.

1144
01:20:29,897 --> 01:20:33,886
You still shagging the...
Yank totty's sister, are we?

1145
01:20:33,986 --> 01:20:36,226
No, I blew that one.

1146
01:20:38,572 --> 01:20:41,697
Threw away a pearl beyond price.

1147
01:20:41,797 --> 01:20:45,514
Totty and Totty's sister.

1148
01:20:45,614 --> 01:20:49,160
None of us are talking.
It's all a big mess.

1149
01:20:56,722 --> 01:21:01,358
Marvelous bloody place,
though, isn't it? Californ-i-a?

1150
01:21:02,922 --> 01:21:07,935
Sunshine, beaches, and girls. Yeah.

1151
01:21:09,289 --> 01:21:11,389
Marijuana.

1152
01:21:11,489 --> 01:21:15,096
God, how the buggering hell
did I miss out on all that for so long?

1153
01:21:15,656 --> 01:21:17,575
You came.

1154
01:21:18,175 --> 01:21:20,392
You saw it once.

1155
01:21:23,214 --> 01:21:26,285
It all goes so fast.

1156
01:21:28,172 --> 01:21:31,432
These buggers here,
they don't think I've got long.

1157
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:36,003
Well...

1158
01:21:36,303 --> 01:21:38,462
it's all a load of bollocks, really.

1159
01:21:39,062 --> 01:21:40,743
What is?

1160
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:46,118
You know, there's nothing honorable
in misery, Richard.

1161
01:21:47,131 --> 01:21:49,828
Carpe diem.

1162
01:21:49,928 --> 01:21:53,461
Boff and be merry.

1163
01:21:53,947 --> 01:21:57,822
Now, listen. You listen to me carefully.

1164
01:21:57,922 --> 01:22:03,501
This might be the most important
bit of advice I'll ever give you.

1165
01:22:08,372 --> 01:22:10,632
For God's sake, man...

1166
01:22:10,732 --> 01:22:13,412
go and get your bloody girl.

1167
01:22:13,889 --> 01:22:15,764
Go on.

1168
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:18,484
Bugger off.

1169
01:22:30,697 --> 01:22:32,709
Hey, Richard.

1170
01:22:35,089 --> 01:22:37,384
You remember my epitaph.

1171
01:22:39,214 --> 01:22:41,168
Of course I do, Dad.

1172
01:22:42,555 --> 01:22:44,759
Of course I do.

1173
01:23:46,472 --> 01:23:49,901
Byzantium is the place he longs for.

1174
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:52,572
He needs to make this journey.

1175
01:23:52,672 --> 01:23:56,189
I'm going to sort this all out.
I promise you. Okay, Jake?

1176
01:23:56,289 --> 01:23:57,743
<i>How?</i>

1177
01:24:00,105 --> 01:24:02,301
I'll Skype you tomorrow, okay?

1178
01:24:10,497 --> 01:24:12,047
Is she talking to Olivia yet?

1179
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:15,355
<i>Olivia's book launches here next week.
Kate isn't even going.</i>

1180
01:24:16,255 --> 01:24:19,726
- <i>She's icing everyone out, even me.</i>
- All right.

1181
01:24:20,226 --> 01:24:21,577
See ya, Brian.

1182
01:24:21,677 --> 01:24:24,539
Yeats knows that unless
he makes this journey,

1183
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:28,889
unless he defies logic and authority,

1184
01:24:29,089 --> 01:24:33,909
unless his soul claps hands
and sings out loud...

1185
01:24:36,797 --> 01:24:39,155
he is nothing more...

1186
01:24:39,855 --> 01:24:43,237
than a tattered coat upon a stick.

1187
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:13,843
You old bugger.

1188
01:25:17,030 --> 01:25:19,920
There is a country for old men.

1189
01:25:22,572 --> 01:25:24,755
If not now, when?

1190
01:25:26,005 --> 01:25:31,159
Ernesto, Richard Haig. <i>Cómo está?</i>

1191
01:26:27,405 --> 01:26:29,977
<i>Adios! Adios, amigos.</i>

1192
01:26:40,705 --> 01:26:43,265
- Hey, Dad.
- <i>Hi, Jakey.</i>

1193
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:45,513
<i>Go to the door and tell me what you see.</i>

1194
01:26:45,613 --> 01:26:47,384
Okay.

1195
01:26:55,047 --> 01:26:59,213
Oh, look at you, boy! Oh, look at you.

1196
01:26:59,313 --> 01:27:01,076
Richie!

1197
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:07,388
Thank God you're here, dude.
Thank God. Thank God.

1198
01:27:07,488 --> 01:27:10,772
- You can let go now, Brian. That's okay.
- Okay. All right. Okay.

1199
01:27:11,772 --> 01:27:14,165
Can you believe it, Mom?
He's really here.

1200
01:27:14,455 --> 01:27:17,972
- Hi, Kate.
- Hey, how did you get here?

1201
01:27:18,072 --> 01:27:20,988
I just came across the border.
It's an old trick of mine.

1202
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:24,905
- What if you get caught?
- I won't. I'll be gone before they know it.

1203
01:27:25,005 --> 01:27:29,697
Remember my lawyer, Ernesto? He's going
to sort this whole mess out, okay?

1204
01:27:29,797 --> 01:27:31,413
- Yay!
- Don't you worry.

1205
01:27:31,513 --> 01:27:33,580
It's only going to cost me a fortune.

1206
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:37,033
And look, Kate,
we can't keep going like this.

1207
01:27:37,133 --> 01:27:41,672
I mean, Jake, he needs his mom
and dad to be adults, right?

1208
01:27:42,172 --> 01:27:43,842
Yeah.

1209
01:27:45,088 --> 01:27:48,438
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry we hurt you.

1210
01:27:48,538 --> 01:27:52,647
Olivia wanted to tell you,
and it was my fault she didn't.

1211
01:27:53,147 --> 01:27:57,030
But you're sisters. Come on.
Cut her some slack.

1212
01:27:57,130 --> 01:27:59,634
Life is so short, Kate.

1213
01:28:00,347 --> 01:28:03,507
Like my dad used to say, carpe diem.

1214
01:28:03,607 --> 01:28:06,243
Let's boff and be merry?

1215
01:28:08,555 --> 01:28:11,072
- Okay.
- Great.

1216
01:28:11,172 --> 01:28:14,442
Great. And... one last thing.

1217
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:18,282
- Can I take a shower, please?
- He really stinks.

1218
01:28:19,655 --> 01:28:24,877
Thank you, everybody, for coming.
I would like to thank my agent,

1219
01:28:24,977 --> 01:28:26,542
Tim Prince.

1220
01:28:26,642 --> 01:28:29,613
I would also like to thank my...

1221
01:28:29,713 --> 01:28:32,822
ex brother-in-law, Richard.

1222
01:28:32,922 --> 01:28:36,372
He was the inspiration
for the burnt-out,

1223
01:28:36,472 --> 01:28:40,755
recovering-alcoholic cop
who saves the day.

1224
01:28:41,205 --> 01:28:43,909
Although he doesn't know it,
so let's not tell him.

1225
01:28:44,888 --> 01:28:49,847
And, lastly, I would like to thank
somebody very special to me

1226
01:28:49,947 --> 01:28:52,697
who couldn't be here today,

1227
01:28:52,797 --> 01:28:56,717
which is nobody's fault but mine.

1228
01:29:24,171 --> 01:29:26,540
All right. Here we are.

1229
01:29:39,738 --> 01:29:41,409
Hey.

1230
01:29:45,488 --> 01:29:48,732
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

1231
01:29:48,832 --> 01:29:50,821
I'm sorry, too.

1232
01:29:50,921 --> 01:29:53,384
Let's never fight again, okay?

1233
01:29:54,455 --> 01:29:56,309
Come here.

1234
01:30:05,088 --> 01:30:08,463
- Let's go back inside.
- Just give me a minute, all right?

1235
01:30:08,563 --> 01:30:10,259
Okay.

1236
01:30:20,430 --> 01:30:22,184
Hi.

1237
01:30:23,488 --> 01:30:27,534
- You came.
- I came. Piece of cake.

1238
01:30:31,213 --> 01:30:33,709
I came because I love you.

1239
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:37,525
I came because I need you.

1240
01:30:38,921 --> 01:30:41,171
I need my son.

1241
01:30:41,271 --> 01:30:43,555
I need my family.

1242
01:30:43,655 --> 01:30:45,709
That's why I came.

1243
01:30:47,921 --> 01:30:51,246
- You want to hear something crazy?
- What?

1244
01:30:51,346 --> 01:30:52,888
I knew you'd come.

1245
01:30:52,988 --> 01:30:56,205
- It's irrational.
- It's romantic.

1246
01:30:56,905 --> 01:30:58,956
You and I...

1247
01:30:59,056 --> 01:31:03,084
we've only had moments.
Now we have time.

1248
01:31:27,388 --> 01:31:32,242
I spent my whole life
in opposition to this man.

1249
01:31:33,471 --> 01:31:36,325
Honestly, he never did
a bloody thing for me,

1250
01:31:37,255 --> 01:31:39,384
except this.

1251
01:31:40,963 --> 01:31:43,884
Asking me to scatter his ashes here.

1252
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:49,184
And it saved my life,

1253
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:53,980
because it brought me back to the people
I love most in this world.

1254
01:32:01,005 --> 01:32:04,488
- Even you, Brian.
- You're the man, Richard.

1255
01:32:04,858 --> 01:32:08,821
There comes a time, and there's always
a time, and I guess this is the time.

1256
01:32:08,921 --> 01:32:12,975
So, Jakey, shall we set grandpa free?

1257
01:32:21,655 --> 01:32:23,709
Okay, Dad.

1258
01:32:24,346 --> 01:32:26,625
Enjoy paradise.

1259
01:32:34,205 --> 01:32:36,988
So how long are you staying?

1260
01:32:37,088 --> 01:32:39,738
Okay, Jakey, listen to me here.

1261
01:32:39,838 --> 01:32:42,100
I have to sort out a few things first.

1262
01:32:43,821 --> 01:32:45,647
But...

1263
01:32:45,747 --> 01:32:49,363
maybe marrying your aunt might help.

1264
01:32:51,588 --> 01:32:55,108
- What?
- Well, I am down on one knee.

1265
01:32:58,404 --> 01:33:01,425
Then get up and kiss me again.

1266
01:33:19,938 --> 01:33:23,329
<i>Up and away we set off</i>

1267
01:33:23,938 --> 01:33:27,650
<i>Secretly scared we'd get lost</i>

1268
01:33:28,146 --> 01:33:32,188
<i>Up in the clouds, over the town</i>

1269
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:35,498
<i>Beyond the wall</i>

1270
01:33:36,288 --> 01:33:39,871
<i>Some of us knew we might fall</i>

1271
01:33:40,471 --> 01:33:43,988
<i>Under the weight of it all</i>

1272
01:33:44,388 --> 01:33:48,496
<i>And though we'd been warned
of the oncoming storms</i>

1273
01:33:48,596 --> 01:33:51,541
<i>Still we stood tall</i>

1274
01:33:52,671 --> 01:33:56,554
<i>Soar from the moonlight</i>

1275
01:33:56,654 --> 01:34:00,763
<i>Straight to the sunrise</i>

1276
01:34:00,863 --> 01:34:04,721
<i>This will be our time</i>

1277
01:34:04,821 --> 01:34:09,071
<i>To free-fall and nose-dive</i>

1278
01:34:09,171 --> 01:34:13,054
<i>Out of the black night</i>

1279
01:34:13,154 --> 01:34:16,946
<i>Into the bright light</i>

1280
01:34:17,046 --> 01:34:20,963
<i>With the whole world in our sight</i>

1281
01:34:21,063 --> 01:34:25,473
<i>Like a miniature paradise</i>

1282
01:34:27,567 --> 01:34:29,633
<i>Yeah</i>

1283
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:45,152
<i>My shadow is cast on the ground</i>

1284
01:34:45,771 --> 01:34:49,625
<i>I'm flying too fast to look down</i>

1285
01:34:49,888 --> 01:34:51,987
<i>At the rooftops and trees</i>

1286
01:34:52,087 --> 01:34:56,992
<i>And my family waving at me</i>

1287
01:34:58,204 --> 01:35:02,163
<i>Soar from the moonlight</i>

1288
01:35:02,263 --> 01:35:06,430
<i>Straight to the sunrise</i>

1289
01:35:06,530 --> 01:35:10,413
<i>This will be our time</i>

1290
01:35:10,513 --> 01:35:14,596
<i>To free-fall and nose-dive</i>

1291
01:35:14,696 --> 01:35:18,738
<i>Out of the black night</i>

1292
01:35:18,838 --> 01:35:22,454
<i>Into the bright light</i>

1293
01:35:22,554 --> 01:35:26,513
<i>With the whole world in our sight</i>

1294
01:35:26,613 --> 01:35:30,624
<i>Like a miniature paradise</i>

1295
01:36:07,254 --> 01:36:11,804
<i>I go crazy sometimes</i>

1296
01:36:12,204 --> 01:36:15,433
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

1297
01:36:17,054 --> 01:36:19,904
<i>Yeah, I swear I'm fine</i>

1298
01:36:20,004 --> 01:36:24,829
<i>That I'm all right
but I'm barely breathing</i>

1299
01:36:26,229 --> 01:36:30,246
<i>Thought I could find my way back home</i>

1300
01:36:30,746 --> 01:36:34,229
<i>But I get lost alone</i>

1301
01:36:34,821 --> 01:36:37,054
<i>But when I'm with you</i>

1302
01:36:37,154 --> 01:36:39,329
<i>I'm no longer wandering</i>

1303
01:36:39,429 --> 01:36:43,923
<i>And when I'm with you
I swear I can breathe</i>

1304
01:36:44,023 --> 01:36:45,962
<i>And when I'm with you</i>

1305
01:36:46,062 --> 01:36:51,171
<i>I know who I am and who I want to be</i>

1306
01:36:57,271 --> 01:37:01,087
<i>I'm not trying to be dramatic, no</i>

1307
01:37:01,587 --> 01:37:05,223
<i>Most times I'm pretty normal</i>

1308
01:37:07,221 --> 01:37:11,429
<i>Oh, let's be clear and honest here</i>

1309
01:37:11,529 --> 01:37:15,400
<i>And do away with anything formal</i>

1310
01:37:16,354 --> 01:37:20,621
<i>I can fake it on my own</i>

1311
01:37:20,721 --> 01:37:24,630
<i>But I am lost alone</i>

1312
01:37:24,946 --> 01:37:27,112
<i>'Cause when I'm with you</i>

1313
01:37:27,212 --> 01:37:29,396
<i>I'm no longer wandering</i>

1314
01:37:29,496 --> 01:37:33,962
<i>And when I'm with you
I swear I can breathe</i>

1315
01:37:34,062 --> 01:37:36,004
<i>And when I'm with you</i>

1316
01:37:36,104 --> 01:37:41,208
<i>I know who I am and who I want to be</i>

1317
01:37:47,429 --> 01:37:50,241
<i>Who I want to be</i>

1318
01:37:59,429 --> 01:38:03,777
<i>But I am wide-eyed</i>

1319
01:38:04,154 --> 01:38:06,887
<i>With a pension for running</i>

1320
01:38:06,987 --> 01:38:09,804
<i>But how many times does it take</i>

1321
01:38:09,904 --> 01:38:12,454
<i>Till I find that I'm lost</i>

1322
01:38:12,554 --> 01:38:15,639
<i>When I'm alone</i>

1323
01:38:15,739 --> 01:38:19,454
<i>And that's not where I belong</i>

1324
01:38:19,554 --> 01:38:21,762
<i>'Cause when I'm with you</i>

1325
01:38:21,862 --> 01:38:24,271
<i>I'm no longer wandering</i>
