So Trish,
I hear that

01:02:28,855 --> 01:02:30,431
this is your first time
in the States?

1103
01:02:30,467 --> 01:02:32,561
- Yeah, it is.
- And how do you like it?

1104
01:02:32,672 --> 01:02:34,772
There's a lot to see.

1105

It's kind of worn out
its welcome, if you ask me.

1106
01:02:38,007 --> 01:02:41,305
Be happy to get back home
once I graduate.

1107
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:43,941
You're moving back to England
after graduation?

1108
01:02:43,977 --> 01:02:45,862
Yeah, of course I am.

1109
01:02:45,898 --> 01:02:48,590
[Karen] Trish, can I get you

1110
01:02:48,626 --> 01:02:50,437
[Trish] No. But it was lovely.
Thank you.

1111
01:02:50,473 --> 01:02:52,072
I'm so glad you like it.

01:02:52,192 --> 01:02:53,782
We got it in Greece

[Ken]
I stuck to Pellegrino.

1114
01:02:56,036 --> 01:02:59,170
We stayed in
this gorgeous villa.

1115
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:02,288
Did you know that
the beaches in Santorini

1116
01:03:02,324 --> 01:03:04,778
are made up of
volcanic pebbles,

1117
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:07,947
so there's no sand
to make the water murky.

1118
01:03:07,983 --> 01:03:10,061
So it is a crystal-clear...

1119
01:03:10,097 --> 01:03:12,730
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- [Trish] Hardin.

1120
01:03:12,878 --> 01:03:14,683
- Excuse me?
- Look at your fucking trousers.

1121
01:03:14,719 --> 01:03:16,318
I'm sorry, Mum,
but seriously,

1122
01:03:16,379 --> 01:03:18,732
do you have any sensitivity
whatsoever?

1123
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:20,453
You're just boorishly droning on

1124
01:03:20,489 --> 01:03:22,606
with no regard for
the lives you destroyed.

1125
01:03:23,345 --> 01:03:25,814
P-Perhaps we could find
a more private place

1126
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:28,917
- to have this conversation.
- By all means.

1127
01:03:29,084 --> 01:03:31,684
It's Bill Gates.
[laughs]

1128
01:03:33,306 --> 01:03:35,699
Okay, well, you are obviously
quite upset with me,

1129
01:03:35,735 --> 01:03:38,102
so go ahead and say
what's on your mind.

1130
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:40,375
Why did you even
invite us here?

1131
01:03:40,411 --> 01:03:42,127
I invited you here
because you're my family.

1132
01:03:42,163 --> 01:03:44,012
We're not your family.
We <i>were</i> your family.

1133

- You ran out and reinvented...
- Hardin, I thought we were past this.

1134
01:03:46,917 --> 01:03:49,553
We didn't get past it. How were
we supposed to get past it?

1135
01:03:49,589 --> 01:03:51,761
You haven't owned up
to anything!

1136
01:03:51,797 --> 01:03:53,897
Your twelve steps...
making amends.

1137
01:03:54,104 --> 01:03:56,517
Where's Mum's amends?
Mum, have you got your amends yet?

1138
01:03:56,553 --> 01:03:57,719
What would you
like me to do?

1139
01:03:57,755 --> 01:03:59,764
You don't think that
I am consumed by guilt?

1140
01:03:59,846 --> 01:04:01,959
I knew that night
that I had to go.

1141
01:04:01,995 --> 01:04:04,466
No! After that night
you had to <i>stay!</i>

1142
01:04:04,502 --> 01:04:06,735
And you didn't!
That night happened <i>because</i> of you!

1143
01:04:06,771 --> 01:04:09,255
Yes! And I have been haunted
by it for the last ten years!

1144
01:04:09,348 --> 01:04:11,618
It haunts you?!
I fucking watched it happen,

No, wait. You don't have to get an Uber.
I can give you a ride.

you've just pulled?

Not to mention
you're drunk.

Look, I'm sorry
I'm not like you.

1153
01:04:35,133 --> 01:04:37,999
You may be able to forget
everything he did, but I can't.

1154
01:04:38,033 --> 01:04:40,434
I haven't forgotten anything.

1155

01:07:13,889 --> 01:07:15,486
so... lunch?

01:07:15,522 --> 01:07:16,824

Great. I'll email you

I know,
very chivalrous of me.

1200

I thought that things were
getting better, but...

1201
01:07:32,655 --> 01:07:36,555
it's clear that he still has a
lot of stuff he has to deal with.

1202
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:39,534
And I just feel
really bad for him...

1203
01:07:39,631 --> 01:07:41,928
and I don't know
how to fix it.

1204
01:07:42,035 --> 01:07:44,336
Well, let me ask you this.

1205
01:07:45,426 --> 01:07:47,857
Are you in love with him?

1206
01:07:48,669 --> 01:07:52,202
- I am.
- Then you got yourself a problem.

1207
01:07:54,283 --> 01:07:56,116
Those are your
words of wisdom?

1208
01:07:56,152 --> 01:07:57,807
Hey, I never said I had
any words of wisdom.

1209
01:07:57,843 --> 01:08:03,341
No, you just wanted to know
whether I actually loved him.

1210
01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:05,892
I should get back to work.

1211
01:08:07,984 --> 01:08:10,685
Thank you for lunch.

Yeah, it was shit.

And Hardin, I want you
to stop punishing yourself.

1630
01:29:37,123 --> 01:29:38,671
So you think it's fair
that he gets to live in

- Mike.
- Mike?

- Wanker-from-next-door Mike?
- He's <i>not</i> a wanker!
