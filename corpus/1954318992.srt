All right, let's run
down the hit list.

1271
00:52:39,223 --> 00:52:41,857
You molested a teacher.

1272
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:47,863
You sexually harassed a female
freshman student and a male
hall monitor.

1273
00:52:47,865 --> 00:52:50,499
And then -- [ Chuckles ]
This is funny.

1274
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:53,035
You got in a fight with
a girl and you lost.

1275
00:52:53,037 --> 00:52:56,071
She curb-stomped my
genitals. With her shoes.

1276
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:56,839
Mm-hmm.

1277
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:56,839
Then I called your mom.

1278
00:52:56,841 --> 00:53:00,276
Your mom and dad are
on their way, by the way.

1279
00:53:00,278 --> 00:53:02,745
And she said that she caught
you masturbating this morning.

1280
00:53:02,747 --> 00:53:03,579
It was a wet dream.

1281
00:53:03,581 --> 00:53:05,347
I wasn't masturbating.

1282
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:05,347
Whatever.

1283
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:12,154
Seems like to me you're going
for a varsity letter in sexual
deviancy.

1284
00:53:12,156 --> 00:53:13,055
Can I go to the bathroom?

1285
00:53:13,057 --> 00:53:15,558
Yeah, in your pants.

1286

leaving this office.

Let's take a look.

1289
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,833
I can't figure out what would

1290

make a boy like you snap.
I mean, up to this point, no
missteps.

1291
00:53:31,142 --> 00:53:35,311
What would make a boy like
you do what you did?

1292
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:37,012
I mean, it's a big question.

1293
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:39,281
Is society at fault?

1294
00:53:39,283 --> 00:53:41,684
Probably.

1295

You take Paxil or something?

1300
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:58,968
Maybe it's your home life.

1301
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:00,903
I don't know.

1302
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:02,905
Maybe you have horrible parents.

1303
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:05,474
But here is the hard truth that

1304
00:54:05,476 --> 00:54:09,445
America is not
prepared to admit.

1305
00:54:09,447 --> 00:54:14,383
We're all just...Filthy animals.

1306
00:54:14,385 --> 00:54:17,019
And to expect us to play by the

1308
00:54:19,657 --> 00:54:22,725
that's ri-goddamn-diculous.

We were all thinking about it.

1312
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,004
As long as you don't sell crack

1313
00:54:35,006 --> 00:54:35,004
or burn the campus down, I

1314
00:54:35,006 --> 00:54:40,476
really don't care if you
play a little ass-grab, but...

1315
00:54:40,478 --> 00:54:43,779
I mean, hell, if I had the
budget, I would build us a

1316
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,381
windowless room where you

1317
00:54:45,383 --> 00:54:47,149
