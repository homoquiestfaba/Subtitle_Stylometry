00:00:18,843 --> 00:00:20,544
Run!

3
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:22,145
Run for your life!

4
00:00:22,212 --> 00:00:24,113
Oh! Keep away!

5
00:00:24,148 --> 00:00:25,615
- Take it!
- Keep away!

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,151
- Take all of it!
- The monster took my shoe!

7
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:33,122
Candy!

8
00:00:33,157 --> 00:00:35,558
Yay. Treats. I love treats.

9
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,359
- Felicia.
- Hi, daddy!

10
00:00:37,427 --> 00:00:40,029
That was a nice grip you
had on that big fat kid.

11
00:00:40,096 --> 00:00:42,364
Farkle, excellent work with your teeth.

12
00:00:42,432 --> 00:00:44,332
- Fergus, my lad...
- Daddy, daddy, daddy.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,635
You're gonna have to
work on your timing.

14
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,171
All in all, not bad for
your first Halloween.

15
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:51,873
They're growing up so fast.

16
00:00:51,941 --> 00:00:54,008
And look who got her
first clump of hair!

17
00:00:54,076 --> 00:00:57,745
Oh, did you see? Farkle
got him in the ankle.

18
00:00:57,813 --> 00:00:59,948
- What about little Fergus?
- Nothing yet.

19
00:01:00,015 --> 00:01:01,616
Oh, that's all right, sweetie.

20
00:01:01,684 --> 00:01:03,551
Mommy didn't get a
scare this year either.

21
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:07,020
Fear not, my love. The
night is still young.

22
00:01:07,088 --> 00:01:09,990
Hold the phone. Who left the door open?

23
00:01:10,024 --> 00:01:11,592
You don't think... someone's inside?

24
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:15,428
Now, who'd be stupid enough
to break into an ogre's house?

25
00:01:16,764 --> 00:01:18,765
- Aah!
- Aah!

26
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,100
Booo!

27
00:01:21,435 --> 00:01:23,069
Oh, wow... Terrifying.

28
00:01:23,136 --> 00:01:25,204
I don't know how I'm gonna sleep now.

29
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:26,772
Happy Halloween, everyone.

30
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,907
Oh, man.

31
00:01:27,975 --> 00:01:29,742
You said this was gonna scare 'em!

32
00:01:31,277 --> 00:01:34,146
Hey! I worked hard on this costume!

33
00:01:34,214 --> 00:01:35,715
Oops. Heh heh!

34
00:01:35,782 --> 00:01:36,849
Admit it, Shrek.

35
00:01:36,883 --> 00:01:38,084
Weren't you even a little bit scared?

36
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:40,218
Donkey, ogres don't get scared.

37
00:01:40,285 --> 00:01:41,953
We do the scaring.

38
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:45,090
And that's why we're
the kings of Halloween.

39
00:01:45,157 --> 00:01:48,093
I bet we can find something
that will scare the pants off of you!

40
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,294
- Which would scare me.
- Oh, really?

41
00:01:50,362 --> 00:01:51,596
And what do you have in mind?

42
00:01:51,664 --> 00:01:54,732
All of us telling scary
stories all night long.

43
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,233
There ain't no way you won't be scared!

44
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,069
Yes! Stories to make
your blood run cold!

45
00:01:59,137 --> 00:02:01,605
- Yeah!
- Stories to terrify you.

46
00:02:01,673 --> 00:02:03,674
- Yeah!
- And whoever shall last

47
00:02:03,742 --> 00:02:07,477
through the night shall be
named the king of Halloween!

48
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:09,947
- I accept.
- We doubly accept.

49
00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:13,415
Does anyone else want
to join our little contest?

50
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:15,752
- I'm in!
- Ja, wonderbar!

51
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:17,286
- Huzzah!
- Okay.

52
00:02:17,354 --> 00:02:19,022
I think I'm going to take the kids out

53
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:20,957
and terrify a few
more trick or treaters.

54
00:02:21,025 --> 00:02:23,259
- Will I see you later?
- The night is young.

55
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:25,695
Trick or treat.

56
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:25,695
Ahem. Ahem!

57
00:02:25,763 --> 00:02:26,995
I shall begin.

58
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,131
Once upon a midnight dreary...

59
00:02:29,198 --> 00:02:31,266
There was this crazy
albino guy with a hook,

60
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:32,400
and he lived in a mirror!

61
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:33,635
And if you even look at him,

62
00:02:33,703 --> 00:02:35,303
you'd wake up in bathtub full of ice

63
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:36,337
with your kidneys gone!

64
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:38,206
Well... Hey, hold on.

65
00:02:38,274 --> 00:02:40,542
I didn't say we were doing this here.

66
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:42,810
- Uh... What?
- You named the terms.

67
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:44,712
I name the place.

68
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,647
Okay, fine.
Where we gonna do this?

69
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:52,186
- Castle Duloc?
- Oh, ha ha.

70
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:53,520
Very funny, Shrek.

71
00:02:53,588 --> 00:02:55,723
But this is where
Lord Farquaad lived!

72
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,424
Ja. Und died.

73
00:02:57,492 --> 00:02:59,893
I heard it's haunted by his ghost!

74
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,196
If you're all too scared
to put on big boy pants and go in,

75
00:03:03,263 --> 00:03:06,132
I'll just claim my winnings
and be on my way.

76
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:07,600
Wait a minute!

77
00:03:07,668 --> 00:03:10,336
We can last in there
just as long as you can.

78
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:12,872
Fine. Come on then.

79
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,340
Hold up, Shrek.

80
00:03:14,408 --> 00:03:17,576
You can't just go barging
in some creepy, spooky joint

81
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:17,576
like you own the place.

82
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:18,944
And why not?

83
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:20,746
It's not like there's
anyone here to stop us.

84
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:22,748
I still don't know about this, man.

85
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:24,783
You know... Whole creepy
house-of-wax vibe

86
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:26,351
goin' on in here.

87
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:29,354

- No!

104
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,913
Well, then...

105
00:04:16,981 --> 00:04:18,482
This ought to be fun.

106
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,584
Pff. Fun. Yeah, right.

107
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:22,386
I find myself agreeing with boss.

108
00:04:22,453 --> 00:04:25,054
This looks to be a very
entertaining evening.

109
00:04:25,122 --> 00:04:27,390
You know what, I just figured out
what your costume is.

110
00:04:27,457 --> 00:04:28,591
You came as a kiss-up!

111
00:04:28,658 --> 00:04:31,226
All right, all right.
Buckle up, everybody.

112
00:04:31,294 --> 00:04:33,396
The quicker I scare
the wits out of you lot,

113
00:04:33,463 --> 00:04:36,399
the sooner I can be home,
cozy in my bed.

114
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:40,068
Unless anyone else thinks
they've got what it takes.

115
00:04:40,136 --> 00:04:41,403
Oh! Oh! Pick me, pick me!

116
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,904
I have a scary story!

117
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:46,374
This isn't the one about you getting
trapped in the petting zoo again, is it?

118
00:04:46,442 --> 00:04:48,410
- 'Cause that's not scary.
- Actually...

119
00:04:48,477 --> 00:04:50,645
If you look at it from my perspective...

120
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:52,747
Hey, guess what, Pinocchio,
no one cares!

121
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:55,049
Get ready to send these
jokers home, Shrek,

122
00:04:55,117 --> 00:04:56,918
'cause I've got a doozy...

123
00:04:56,985 --> 00:04:59,252
and it's all true!

124
00:05:01,122 --> 00:05:04,357
It was a dark and stormy night...

125
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,063
Gingy?

126
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:12,966
My girlfriend kicked me out.

127
00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:16,602
I don't know, something about
me being too into myself.

128
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,004
Blah, blah, blah, yack, yack, yack.

129
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:21,273
You? But you are so adorable.

130
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:23,476
I know!
That's what I keep telling her!

131
00:05:23,544 --> 00:05:25,678
I need a good woman, Muffin Man.

132
00:05:25,746 --> 00:05:28,648
Ah. I can help you, Gingy.

133
00:05:28,715 --> 00:05:30,982
- How about this one?
- Aw, I dunno.

134
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,485
- You like her, huh?
- Nope. Weird hair.

135
00:05:33,553 --> 00:05:35,119
- How about this one?
- Too skinny.

136
00:05:35,187 --> 00:05:36,788
No! Don't like it!

137
00:05:36,856 --> 00:05:38,690
Okay. Well, how about this one?

138
00:05:38,758 --> 00:05:40,258
Yes! That's it!

139
00:05:40,326 --> 00:05:42,026
Ah!

140
00:05:42,094 --> 00:05:46,296
She's perfect.
The girl of my dreams.

141
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:50,434
Wait! More sugar.

142
00:05:50,502 --> 00:05:52,202
But that is not the recipe.

143
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,506
Trust me, Muffin Man,
this girl's gotta be real sweet.

144
00:05:55,574 --> 00:05:58,141
I want someone
who will love me forever.

145
00:05:58,209 --> 00:05:59,877
I must warn you, Gingy.

146
00:05:59,945 --> 00:06:02,278
No one has ever made
cookies with this much sugar.

147
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:05,849
You are tampering with forces
far beyond your comprehension!

148
00:06:07,585 --> 00:06:09,552
Just put her in the oven!

149
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:25,133
Ah ha ha ha ha!

150
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:26,902
Ah ha ha ha...

151
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,637
Ow!

152
00:06:28,705 --> 00:06:29,638
Ha ha ha ha!

153
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:33,741
Hey. I get a little privacy?

154
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:35,376
- Huh?
- Take a hike.

155
00:06:35,443 --> 00:06:38,178
Oh, oui.

156
00:06:49,124 --> 00:06:51,224
Oh, my gosh, I'm in love!

157
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:54,093
A cookie angel.

158
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:55,194
Wow!

159
00:06:55,262 --> 00:06:57,564
And you're hot too!

160
00:06:57,632 --> 00:06:59,566
Hello?

Hello?

Oh...

163
00:07:03,638 --> 00:07:06,405
I guess it didn't work.

164
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:16,982
Ha ha!

165
00:07:17,017 --> 00:07:20,986
Gingy, is it you?
The one I was made for?

166
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:23,588
Oh, we'll be together forever.

180
00:07:58,222 --> 00:08:00,623
The time since I met you
has been the best...

181
00:08:00,691 --> 00:08:02,625
7 1/2 minutes of my life.

182
00:08:02,693 --> 00:08:05,094
Good! Because this is
only the beginning.

183
00:08:05,161 --> 00:08:07,963
I'm going to love you and hold you

184
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,631
and feed you and dress you

185
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:11,666
- and cling to you...
- Yeah...

186
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:14,303
Hang on to you and
smother you with my love.

187
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,937
- Yeah...
- Forever and ever and ever

188
00:08:16,005 --> 00:08:17,639
- and ever and ever...
- You know,

189
00:08:17,707 --> 00:08:19,207
it's gettin' a little stuffy in here.

190
00:08:19,241 --> 00:08:22,042
You know, I might go get some air.

191
00:08:22,077 --> 00:08:23,544
Oh, no, you don't.

192
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:24,678
Oh, no...

193
00:08:24,746 --> 00:08:26,647
Not without your umbrella.

194
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:29,717
- Come on!
- Here, let me get that.

195
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:31,219
Wait for me!

196
00:08:31,253 --> 00:08:34,404
Sugar, could you just do me
one small, little teensy favor?

197
00:08:34,405 --> 00:08:35,455
Anything.

198
00:08:35,523 --> 00:08:37,957
Could you leave me alone
for like 30 seconds?

199
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:39,559
Anything but that.

200
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:42,662
You know, I forgot my gumdrop buttons.

201
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,665
Yeah! Could you run over there
and get 'em for me, please?

202
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,667
Sure, I can. I'll be right back.

203
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,701
♪ Gingy, Gingy ♪

204
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:50,670
Run, run, run, as fast as you can

205
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,739
if you wanna remain a gingerbread man!

206
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,611
Oh!

207
00:08:58,678 --> 00:08:59,878
- Oh, Gingy.
- Whaa...

208
00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:02,047
I don't understand.

209
00:09:02,115 --> 00:09:04,517
- I thought you were happy!
- Oh, well...

210
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:07,318
It's all my fault.
I should have tried harder!

211
00:09:07,386 --> 00:09:09,187
No, no, no! Don't try harder!

212
00:09:09,255 --> 00:09:11,189
Maybe I'm not pretty enough.

213
00:09:11,257 --> 00:09:14,225
I can be pretty... really pretty!

214
00:09:14,293 --> 00:09:15,693
- The girl of your dreams.
- Aah!

215
00:09:15,761 --> 00:09:16,810
Remember?

216
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:19,397
Farewell!

217
00:09:19,465 --> 00:09:21,766
Gingy!

218
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,234
Let go, Gingy!

219
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:26,203
Fall with me...

220
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,672
so we can be together forever!

221
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:30,073
Here's a thought...

222
00:09:30,141 --> 00:09:31,575
You let go!

223
00:09:31,643 --> 00:09:32,709
Together!

224
00:09:32,777 --> 00:09:34,811
Together fore...

225
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:39,282
Boy, what a night!

226
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:41,551
I'm so glad that is over with!

227
00:09:41,618 --> 00:09:42,685
Oh! Oh, well.

228
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:44,820
- Nothing lasts forever.
- In sports...

229
00:10:07,142 --> 00:10:09,143
Together forever.

230
00:10:09,144 --> 00:10:10,579
Aah!

231
00:10:10,646 --> 00:10:13,113
Together forever.

232
00:10:13,181 --> 00:10:15,549
Together forever.

233
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:18,885
Together forever.

234
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:20,454
What a nice surprise!

235
00:10:20,522 --> 00:10:23,056
Together forever.

236
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:25,593
Together forever.

237
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,760
Together forever.

238
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:30,096
Together forever.

239
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,298
- Hey... So what's up?
- Together forever.

240
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:36,669
I think we both may have said
some things I might regret.

241
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:39,772
- Together forever!
- Gosh, your eye is pretty!

242
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,074
Look, I know you're upset, so... Aah!

243
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,775
Why don't we just sit down...

244
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,177
and discuss this?

245
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,513
Then... they ate me!

246
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,950
Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee!

247
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:53,785
They're gonna do that all the way home.

248
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,254
I... I gotta go.

249
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,788
They're my ride.

250
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:57,749
Wait a minute.

251
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,259
If they ate you,
how is it that you're still here?

252
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:04,428
Did you not say this was a true story?

253
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:05,663
Um...

254
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,265
You made it up, didn't ya?

255
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:10,000
I... hey, look!
Lord Farquaad's ghost!

256
00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:11,969
Aah!

257
00:11:12,036 --> 00:11:14,438
Doody heads!

258
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:17,326
And then there were three.

259
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,277
Who else wants to step up?

260
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,441
I, too, have a terrifying tale to tell.

261
00:11:22,442 --> 00:11:24,281
It was a dark and stormy night!

262
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:26,216
Hey... what the...

263
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:28,419
And we needed to find us some shelter!

264
00:11:31,723 --> 00:11:34,659
This is my turn to tell a story.

265
00:11:34,726 --> 00:11:36,160
Hey, hey. Shh!

266
00:11:36,227 --> 00:11:38,328
The kindly innkeeper
was warm and friendly.

267
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:40,163
She made me feel all bubbly inside.

268
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,132
My trusty sidekick here
would love to freshen up.

269
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,201
- Sidekick?
- And I would love some waffles!

270
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:46,309
But we are equals.

271
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,872
Oh, man. Of course we are...

272
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,474
The noble donkey reassured
his clearly inferior sidekick.

273
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:53,076
I'm getting a little tired of this...

274
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,343
But before Puss could finish his thought,

275
00:11:54,411 --> 00:11:56,812
he decided to take a
well-deserved tongue bath.

276
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,781
Wh... wh... wha... wha...

277
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:00,515
Well, as long as I am here.

278
00:12:00,584 --> 00:12:03,185
But right then,
danger came from behind.

279
00:12:05,455 --> 00:12:07,590
♪ Da-dum, da-dum ♪

280
00:12:07,657 --> 00:12:09,491
♪ Da-dum, da-dum ♪

281
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:12,727
And Puss was never seen again.

282
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:14,395
Ha ha. The End.

283
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,497
No! That's not how the story goes.

284
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:19,033
I was well aware of
the approaching danger

285
00:12:19,101 --> 00:12:21,402
and went for my steel.

286
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,503
Don't worry, little buddy.

287
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:24,038
I'm here to save you!

288
00:12:24,106 --> 00:12:25,640
Ohh. You're killing me.

289
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,575
It was Prince Charming!

290
00:12:27,642 --> 00:12:29,910
He was packing heat,
and he wanted revenge!

291
00:12:29,978 --> 00:12:31,111
I want revenge!

292
00:12:31,145 --> 00:12:33,880
He said. But before anyone
could do anything...

293
00:12:33,948 --> 00:12:35,082
Ba-bam!

294
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:36,449
It was awful and it was terrible,

295
00:12:36,484 --> 00:12:37,851
and it was really, really scary.

296
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:39,987
What? No! Go back!

297
00:12:41,388 --> 00:12:43,156
Although the charming was fast,

298
00:12:43,224 --> 00:12:46,759
I was swift enough to
repel the attack and leap to safety.

299
00:12:46,827 --> 00:12:49,328
Which is exactly what
he wanted you to do.

300
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:51,030
Oh!

301
00:12:51,098 --> 00:12:52,665
Charming laughed,
just like a crazed maniac.

302
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:54,900
Ha ha ha ha ha.

303
00:12:54,968 --> 00:12:57,003
Whoa-oa-oa!

304
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,604
No, no, no, no, no.

305
00:12:58,672 --> 00:13:01,673
I'm sorry, but I would never
let that happen to me.

306
00:13:01,741 --> 00:13:04,208
Instead, I... I... I woke up.

307
00:13:04,276 --> 00:13:05,910
Yeah. That's right!

308
00:13:05,978 --> 00:13:07,712
It was all a dream.

309
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,947
You mean a nightmare.

310
00:13:09,015 --> 00:13:10,949
You know you're on the ceiling, right?

311
00:13:11,017 --> 00:13:13,217
I will get you for this.

312
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:15,153
Oh! And then the lights went out.

313
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:18,622
It was horrible and sad
how Puss pleaded for mercy!

314
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,890
Mercy? Please!

315
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,925
Said Puss with his last dying breath.

316
00:13:21,993 --> 00:13:24,194
But when the lights came back on,

317
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,363
it was the donkey who
was taking a shower!

318
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,865
Oh, my goodness!
Why would I do that?

319
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,101
Ha ha! And right behind you,
there was danger!

320
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:33,435
- Oh, man.
- You were paralyzed!

321
00:13:33,503 --> 00:13:36,005
It was a donkey-eating waffle.

322
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,274
It was packing heat,
and it wanted revenge.

323
00:13:38,341 --> 00:13:41,443
I want revenge!

324
00:13:41,511 --> 00:13:43,145
The donkey ran.

325
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:45,381
But how far can you run
when you are on a plate

326
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:47,916
covered in butter wearing a pink tutu?

327
00:13:47,984 --> 00:13:49,117
- No!
- And a sombrero.

328
00:13:49,186 --> 00:13:50,719
- No!
- And a coconut brassiere!

329
00:13:50,787 --> 00:13:53,289
And about to be eaten alive!

330
00:13:53,356 --> 00:13:56,491
No, please! Please,
I'll switch to pancakes!

331
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,893
- Aah!
- Num, num, num!

332
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,963
And the donkey was never seen again.

333
00:14:03,031 --> 00:14:05,333
Hoo hoo hah hah hah hah hah!

334
00:14:05,401 --> 00:14:07,802
But what Puss didn't know
is that right behind him

335
00:14:07,869 --> 00:14:10,238
was the one thing he feared
more than anything else.

336
00:14:10,306 --> 00:14:12,439
- No. You wouldn't.
- I would.

337
00:14:12,507 --> 00:14:13,840
- You didn't!
- I did!

338
00:14:13,908 --> 00:14:15,576
No! Anything but that!

339
00:14:15,643 --> 00:14:18,245
No!

340
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,283
The End.

341
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:25,652
I'm pretty sure that's cheating.

342
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,321
Ha. It worked, didn't it?

343
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:30,556
Hmm. Who's next in our little contest?

344
00:14:30,591 --> 00:14:33,626
Oh. Has anyone seen the mice?

345
00:14:36,496 --> 00:14:38,965
Are we there yet?

346
00:14:39,033 --> 00:14:40,566
- Ha.
- Okay.

347
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:44,837
I think it's time for a story
that's actually scary.

348
00:14:44,904 --> 00:14:46,371
Pff. Yeah, whatever.

349
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:47,572
Whoop. Pshh, pshh, pshh.

350
00:14:47,607 --> 00:14:50,142
You had your chance. Now, then...

351
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,211
Something beyond comprehension

352
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:54,446
was happening to a little boy

353
00:14:54,513 --> 00:14:56,115
on this street...

354
00:14:56,182 --> 00:14:57,816
in this house.

355
00:14:57,884 --> 00:15:00,985
A man had come as a last resort.

356
00:15:01,053 --> 00:15:03,320
Because...

357
00:15:03,388 --> 00:15:05,757
no one else would go near the place.

358
00:15:09,427 --> 00:15:10,594
Gah!

359
00:15:10,662 --> 00:15:13,597
I hear you've been expecting me.

360
00:15:13,665 --> 00:15:15,599
- You are the...
- That's right.

361
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:17,934
I am...

362
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:20,270
the babysitter.

363
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,105
Yes, sir, yes, thank goodness
you've come.

364
00:15:25,609 --> 00:15:26,843
My boy.

365
00:15:26,911 --> 00:15:28,378
I don't know what's gotten into him.

366
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:29,545
I've-a never seen anything like it.

367
00:15:29,613 --> 00:15:30,781
Trust me, buddy.

368
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:32,614
I've got three little ogres at home.

369
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,483
This will be a piece of cake.

370
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,819
Father!

371
00:15:39,923 --> 00:15:41,356
Father!

372
00:15:41,424 --> 00:15:43,492
O... kay then.

373
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:46,628
Look, I'm-a tell you,
I tried every trick in the book.

374
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,830
- You see?
- "Once Upon a Time-Out"?

375
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:51,666
Oh, come on, now.
You're gonna listen to a goose?

376
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,201
Please, you...
you don't understand.

377
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:54,635
It's like he's-a two different people.

378
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,397
What your kid needs is discipline,

379
00:15:56,398 --> 00:15:58,939
not a bunch of
psychological mumble-jumble.

380
00:15:59,074 --> 00:16:02,210
You just gotta walk in there,
look him in the eye,

381
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:03,711
and show him who's...

382
00:16:06,747 --> 00:16:09,116
Please tell me he's an only child.

383
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:10,918
Bobba gone fishpeas.
Ba, ba, boo.

384
00:16:10,985 --> 00:16:12,953
Um... Hello.

385
00:16:13,021 --> 00:16:14,888
Whoo!

386
00:16:14,956 --> 00:16:16,523
Well, here's your problem.

387
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,625
His head's not screwed on right.

388
00:16:18,693 --> 00:16:23,229
When you wish upon a star,

389
00:16:21,094 --> 00:16:23,229
you get lots of stuff.

390
00:16:23,297 --> 00:16:25,298
Well, I wish for a nice, quiet evening

391
00:16:25,365 --> 00:16:28,234
where you go to sleep
and I raid the icebox.

392
00:16:28,302 --> 00:16:29,235
Okay.

393
00:16:29,303 --> 00:16:31,570
- Ow! Ow! Oh!
- Hey... Ah!

394
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:32,872
Oh! Ah!

395
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,974
Mm.

396
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:37,142
See? That was easy.

397
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,144
It's like I always say.

398
00:16:39,212 --> 00:16:42,413
When it comes to good parenting,
you have to be fair but firm.

399
00:16:42,481 --> 00:16:45,016
You just show him
that you mean business,

400
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:46,651
and he's out of bed again, isn't he?

401
00:16:49,555 --> 00:16:52,589
You never have this problem
with sock puppets.

402
00:16:52,657 --> 00:16:53,724
Aah! Oh!

403
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,492
All right. What's this all about?

404
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,861
Voices.

405
00:16:56,895 --> 00:16:58,695
- Voices?
- Uh-huh!

406
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,964
In here!

407
00:17:00,031 --> 00:17:03,000
Telling me what to do!

408
00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:06,337
You have voices inside your head.

409
00:17:06,404 --> 00:17:08,037
Sometimes.

410
00:17:08,072 --> 00:17:12,008
And what kind of things
do they tell you to do?

411
00:17:12,076 --> 00:17:14,410
Oh!

412
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,181
Oh...

413
00:17:18,249 --> 00:17:19,749
The early bird catches the worm!

414
00:17:19,816 --> 00:17:21,284
What's gotten into this kid?

415
00:17:21,352 --> 00:17:23,019
Hey... Ow! Hey!

416
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:25,187
Maybe you sing him a little song.

417
00:17:25,255 --> 00:17:27,189
Come here, y... I...

418
00:17:27,257 --> 00:17:30,492
Do I look like the kind of
guy that knows a lullaby?

419
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,593
Sing!

420
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,862
♪ Lullaby and good night ♪

421
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,865
♪ Close your big, creepy eyes ♪

422
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:40,434
♪ If you sleep, away I'll creep ♪

423
00:17:40,535 --> 00:17:44,505
♪ And get out of here alive ♪

424
00:17:44,572 --> 00:17:45,873
Oh... You know,

425
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:48,776
once you get past all the
splinters and rope burns,

426
00:17:48,843 --> 00:17:51,245
he's actually kinda cute.

427
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,581
Now where did he go?

428
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:59,519
A bird in the hand is worth
two in the bush!

429
00:17:59,586 --> 00:18:01,754
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

430
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,755
Aah! Aah!

431
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,125
Get him off! Get him off!

432
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,895
Aah!

433
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,397
Ooh...

434
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:13,832
Mm...

435
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,700
Come back here, you!

436
00:18:15,768 --> 00:18:18,870
I regret nothing!

437
00:18:18,939 --> 00:18:20,705
Ow! Ooh!

438
00:18:20,773 --> 00:18:22,107
Ah! Oh!

439
00:18:22,175 --> 00:18:25,544
Ah! Ooh! Ah! Ah!

440
00:18:25,611 --> 00:18:28,246
Ah... Ooh... Ahh...

441
00:18:32,884 --> 00:18:34,018
Eew!

442
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:36,187
I'm too young to have termites!

443
00:18:36,255 --> 00:18:39,090
I'm no termite, Pinocchio.
I'm a cricket.

444
00:18:39,158 --> 00:18:42,526
You were the voice in
my head this whole time?

445
00:18:42,594 --> 00:18:43,527
That's right.

446
00:18:43,528 --> 00:18:46,663
I'm the one who was putting
all those thoughts in your noggin.

447
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,865
I'm your conscience,
and as long as you let me,

448
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:49,866
I'll always be in...

449
00:18:54,272 --> 00:18:56,139
The End.

450
00:18:56,174 --> 00:18:57,841
That wasn't me!

451
00:18:57,908 --> 00:19:00,142
I never had any bugs in my head.

452
00:19:00,177 --> 00:19:02,311
Ha ha. Ask anyone!

453
00:19:02,346 --> 00:19:03,645
Okay, then.

454
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,648
Why don't we start by asking...
your conscience!

455
00:19:08,651 --> 00:19:13,555
Aah!

456
00:19:13,623 --> 00:19:14,991
Uh, now who's cheatin'?

457
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,167
Well, Donkey, looks like
it's just you and me.

458
00:19:21,236 --> 00:19:22,169
Go ahead.

459
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,738
There ain't nothing
you can say that can scare me.

460
00:19:25,005 --> 00:19:27,441
Yeah, well, I suppose
there's nothing left to do

461
00:19:27,508 --> 00:19:30,976
but sit here in the dark
and wait for the ghost.

462
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,478
Ghost? What ghost?

463
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,547
Farquaad's ghost, of course.

464
00:19:34,614 --> 00:19:36,415
As a matter of fact,
if I remember correctly,

465
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,319
I believe you had a hand
in his untimely demise.

466
00:19:40,386 --> 00:19:41,887
Hey, man, that was an accident.

467
00:19:41,955 --> 00:19:45,157
And besides, all that ghost stuff
is just an urban legend.

468
00:19:45,224 --> 00:19:46,891
- You know that!
- Is it?

469
00:19:49,895 --> 00:19:51,429
Okay, okay.

470
00:19:51,464 --> 00:19:53,197
That's... that's just the wind.

471
00:19:53,265 --> 00:19:54,532
Donkey!

472
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,568
And apparently, it knows my name!

473
00:20:01,273 --> 00:20:03,740
That's very funny, Shrek,
but I know it's you doing this.

474
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:07,077
Hey, I... I'm standing
right here with you, Donkey.

475
00:20:09,981 --> 00:20:11,782
No way! This place is not
haunted by a ghost!

476
00:20:11,816 --> 00:20:14,618
And when the sun comes up,
Donkey will be the new king of...

477
00:20:14,652 --> 00:20:15,919
it's right behind me, isn't it?

478
00:20:18,154 --> 00:20:19,154
Aah!

479
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:22,625
- Donkey!
- Oh, my goodness!

480
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:25,094
Aah!

481
00:20:25,161 --> 00:20:27,630
Ha ha ha ha! Ah...

482
00:20:27,664 --> 00:20:31,868
Well, that's what I'd call a
knight to remember.

483
00:20:31,935 --> 00:20:34,569
What do you say we scare
ourselves up some dinner?

484
00:20:34,637 --> 00:20:35,604
I'd say...

485
00:20:35,671 --> 00:20:38,740
Grab the kids, and let's get going.

486
00:20:38,808 --> 00:20:42,477
And that's why we're
the kings of Halloween.

487
00:20:42,512 --> 00:20:43,778
He was so scared.

488
00:20:43,846 --> 00:20:45,780
You probably
won't see him for a month.

489
00:20:45,848 --> 00:20:48,349
So what else have you got
in your bag of tricks?

490
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:49,484
Hmm.

491
00:20:49,518 --> 00:20:51,351
I've got seven eggs.

492
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:52,920
Perfect.

493
00:20:54,956 --> 00:20:56,957
I love this holiday.

494
00:20:57,025 --> 00:20:59,026
Hey!

495
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:00,494
I am not happy!
