1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:03,670
Bobby and Leila, I just wanna say--

2
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:05,205
MAN: Lisa! Lisa!

3
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:07,340
Lisa?

4
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:11,444
Bobby and Lisa, I wish you as much joy in your marriage

5
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,346
as I had in my mine.

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,582
And, Lisa, I've got two words for you.

7
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:19,352
Community property state.

8
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,421
Because one day you're gonna wake up

9
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:25,392
next to that sweat-soaked, beer-laden son of a bitch

10
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:26,359
and you're gonna realize

11
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:29,262
all you have to show for your marital bliss

12
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:32,198
is an ugly-ass white dress you'll never wear again,

13
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,634
probably a case of chlamydia,

14
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:38,304
and the sure knowledge that you have made a hideous mistake.

15
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:41,441
And on that day, you better hope you hid your jewelry

16
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:44,711
and used adequate birth control.

17
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,713
God bless.

18
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:48,748
[man singing in mock Italian]

19
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:17,844
[cheering and applause]

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,248
COMMENTATOR: Somewhere past the infield,

21
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,317
the Mets have a chance to pull this one out

22
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,319
and snap the four-game losing streak.

23
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:28,354
Here's Hanlon, his second pitch to Sanchez,

24
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,190
and that one's fouled off behind the plate...

25
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:31,091
Shit!

26
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:34,127
Sweetie, can we get two more of those?

27
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,329
Oh, Anthony C, he wanted it too.

28
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:37,430
T! T!

29
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,365
He's not C. Please!

30
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,768
- I'm sorry. - Mamma mia.

31
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:45,171
Ooh, naked ladies! Naked ladies!

32
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,140
Well, it's all over.

33
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:48,441
It's not over.

34
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,809
It's all over.

35
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,278
Talkin' about the baseball game, it's not over.

36
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,780
Ahh!

37
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,648
Boner, I'm gonna take him home.

38
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,384
No, I'm the designated hitter tonight.

39
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,453
MAN: Come on, time to get you out of here.

40
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,489
Okay, Bobby, but don't forget to go to church tomorrow.

41
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,493
Bye, T!

42
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,561
[laughs]

43
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,698
You know...

44
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,467
after hanging out with your friends all night,

45
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:19,172
I don't know how you turned out to be such a nice guy.

46
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:21,341
You know, you're not so bad yourself.

47
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,509
[laughs]

48
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,310
I gotta get some sleep.

49
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:27,180
Come on, honey, let's go.

50
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,549
Come on, let's go.

51
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,384
Let's go, come on.

52
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:34,320
- Let's go. - [moaning]

53
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,589
You look so funny.

54
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:37,891
[laughs]

55
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:43,830
Ah, Lisa! I love you.

56
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,566
I love Lisa too.

57
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,335
She's the best.

58
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,403
[kisses]

59
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,238
[Bobby sighing]

60
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,843
You're always late.

61
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:59,846
Why do you have to be always late?

62
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,948
Can't you just buy yourself a clock?

63
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:04,217
Can't you leave an hour early? Why are you always late?

64
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:09,022
It's nice to see you too, Mrs. Weinstein.

65
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:12,258
- What? What was that? - We'll be ready in about 10, 15 minutes.

66
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,861
I want you to come in through the kitchen, I don't want you to go in through the front, though.

67
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,563
The guests are about to arrive. They're gonna see you.

68
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,566
You plotz, you were supposed to be set up two hours ago.

69
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,302
Where in the contract does it say we pay you to be late?

70
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,037
The part that says "working for cheap."

71
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,272
[couple moaning]

72
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,582
[couple sighing]

73
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,823
Ouch! Ouch!

74
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,658
[laughing]

75
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,260
[sighing]

76
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:49,929
Whoo!

77
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,801
[chuckles]

78
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,469
You are looking

79
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:59,739
at the luckiest fucking guy on the planet.

80
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,909
I'm looking at "Mr. I had a thousand fucking cocktails."

81
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,411
- Something like that. - [laughing]

82
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,946
Oh, sorry.

83
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,349
No, Diane, come in. Come on in.

84
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,684
Ow! Don't! Shit.

85
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:15,488
[women laughing]

86
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,659
Gotta go to the bathroom.

87
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:20,927
I'll see you later.

88
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,962
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

89
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,631
See you inside.

90
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,300
[laughs]

91
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:29,869
Oh, look at you.

92
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,938
You look so beautiful!

93
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,641
I can't believe you're really married.

94
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:37,443
Don't cry! [laughing]

95
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,512
Oh, my God.

96
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,781
Oh! You're gonna need this.

97
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,616
- Is he here? - Uh-huh.

98
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,451
I can't believe he's really here.

99
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,787
You know when the last time I saw him was?

100
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,623
It was when I called him and I invited him here

101
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,625
and he said... he said,

102
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,527
"Don't you think we should break up first?"

103
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,895
[laughing]

104
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,897
Do I smell like sex?

105
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,032
- I do. I do. - What?

106
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,502
Or the limo. It smells like sex in here, doesn't it?

107
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,971
Um...

108
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:08,141
Lisa, remember when I loaned you...

109
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:10,710
remember when you borrowed my white Versace dress without me knowing

110
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,512
and you spilled red wine on it--

111
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,747
You gonna bring that up now? That was like, what, three years ago?

112
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,015
-I know, but-- -We got over that.

113
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,917
That was my favorite dress.

114
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,852
I thought I apologized for that already.

115
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,487
Come on, what's the point of this?

116
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:22,822
What's up?

117
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,358
The point is that I forgave you.

118
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,927
Remember that, as hard as it was, I forgave you.

119
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,097
Come on, you two, we're getting ready to do the introductions.

120
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,666
All right, you know, look, you go on ahead, okay? I'll be in in two seconds.

121
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,002
Just give me a minute.

122
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,503
You okay, honey?

123
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,672
I'm fine, I'm fine, just go. Go, go.

124
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,674
- All right. - Just stuff the...

125
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,009
[pills rattling]

126
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,678
You need some aspirin?

127
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,613
I'll see you in a minute, all right?

128
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,632
Congratulations to both of youse.

129
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,535
But, Lisa, watch out now that you're married

130
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,070
for who are your real friends.

131
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,206
I mean, I've been around the block,

132
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,808
but let me tell you, there are two kinds of women,

133
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,877
there's the kind that's your sister,

134
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,647
and there's the kind that'll fuck you behind the back. Watch out for those.

135
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,617
- [funky music playing] - Nick, where are my sticks? Did you get my sticks?

136
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,987
- Yeah, I got 'em, man. - Where are they?

137
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,956
Come on. How come this shit isn't set up?

138
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,225
Hey, fellas, what's going on, man?

139
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:36,496
[indistinct chatter]

140
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,064
Why do you even give a fuck about this?

141
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,133
I don't give a fuck about you.

142
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,803
I want you to set my shit up as soon as possible.

143
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,639
I don't even like you. I don't.

144
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,141
[indistinct chatter, music continues]

145
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,910
- Another night. - And you are pissing me off.

146
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,445
[indistinct chatter]

147
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,582
Look, this is me picking up my big stick.

148
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,151
Max, Max.

149
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,585
Yes.

150
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,854
Who is that?

151
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:05,091
That's Hebber Stebber. He's the lead singer.

152
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,760
He doesn't like to talk to people until he's all set up.

153
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,263
It's not a good idea to talk to musicians in general, Mrs. Weinstein,

154
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,865
until they're all set up, but they're not ready yet.

155
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,468
They're not... yeah.

156
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,937
Listen, Mr. Silver, I have to talk to you.

157
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,606
It's about Mrs. Weinstein. We have to get things rolling.

158
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,942
Um, the wedding party is gonna come in,

159
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:25,778
and they're gonna do their thing, the band's gonna intro them in,

160
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,214
- and then they're gonna do some-- - Weinstein, band intro, right.

161
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,550
- Exactly, and then-- - Listen, don't sweat it, man,

162
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,785
'cause I'm just gonna get the pictures and then I'm outta here, okay?

163
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,887
You're... what?

164
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,623
Ha. I come in, I take a few pictures, then I'm gone, don't sweat it.

165
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,025
- Uh... - I'm outta here.

166
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,793
Wait a second, for the afternoon.

167
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,129
You have to stay for the afternoon, the cutting of the cake.

168
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,031
Yeah, listen, I come in and I take the pictures

169
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,966
and I get the whole thing on film, and then I'm gone.

170
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,534
Right, but make sure that--

171
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,236
[clicking tongue]

172
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,638
Come here.

173
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,974
Does this business work for you?

174
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,809
Well, yeah, Should be over by the piano.

175
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,879
[chuckles] No. No, I mean, weren't you fucking the bride?

176
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:03,015
She would have driven me crazy, man, I could have never stayed with her.

177
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,918
She was born with one of these like pressure genes, you know what I mean?

178
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,320
One of these stress genes, like, you know,

179
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,522
she always has somewhere to go, something to do.

180
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,924
Usually, it was like working out-- I'd say, "Do you wanna go to a movie?"

181
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,193
"I can't, I gotta go work out. I gotta work, I gotta do this."

182
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,195
I think maybe that's why she gets along with Bobby.

183
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,931
I mean, you know, they're always like working out, I think.

184
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,667
But see, that's just living a lie. You know, it's okay to tone,

185
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,736
but if you work out like eight, nine times-- that's living a--

186
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,839
She would have driven me crazy.

187
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:30,743
Lisa, I fucked Bobby last night.

188
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,078
Accidentally.

189
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,081
But it's okay

190
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,850
because I don't remember anything about it.

191
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,285
Oh...

192
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,220

Sorry.

[groans] Oh, God, it's pathetic.

197
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,599
I'm sorry!

This is jammed.

199
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,236
What?

200
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,237
It's jammed.

201
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:03,876
This piece of $25,000 plastic junk is jammed.

202
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,878
- Let me see it. - Wait a minute.

203
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,880
Let me look. Can I look, for crying out loud?

204
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,383
- Jesus, God, let me look at it! - All right!

205
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:14,220
I never get to use the camera. I'm always the stupid assistant.

206
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:17,223
Of course you're the assistant, that's your job.

Yeah, but I never get to use the camera.

210
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,897
I mean, how can I grow in this business

211
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,098
if you don't teach me and show me?

212
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,967

- You're gonna sing that. - All right.

218
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:41,147
Just work your way through it, mumble whatever you wanna sing, it doesn't matter.

219
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,083
I'll call out the chords, and we're gonna do a first dance for the parents' dance.

Then we're gonna do some jazz during dinner.

- Jazz? Jazz? - Some jazz during dinner.

00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,956
I'll swing, but I am not playing fucking jazz.

223
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,091
Jazz is not my joint, man.

224
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,193
- I'm sorry. - MAN: Jazz does suck.

225
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,029
You know what we can do, we can play fake jazz.

226

And, Bobby, you're a lucky guy.

Okay, you guys are the luckiest people in the world.

244
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,674
Guy like me, I wish I was in your shoes, Bobby.

245
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,910
I mean, I know from now on you ain't gonna be able to hit the clubs, you know,

246
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,980
so no more golfing early in the morning, the fishing's over with.

00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:51,150
Uh, you know, those threesomes are definitely a thing of the past,

248
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:55,187
but I love you both, and you're a lucky guy, and just don't let it happen again, okay,

249
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,324
or I'm gonna have to come and hit you on the head, you know what I'm talking about?

250
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,726
Because, you know, I know I had a couple of girls,

251

half of them you know what they are, hose bags,

252
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,398
but I love you, Lisa, you're not one of them.

253
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,833
Take care of each other.

254
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,268

We're kids from the neighborhood.

262
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:30,356
When I was away, you never forgot where I was.

263
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,426
You come and see me, you sent me money.

264
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,861
I'm never gonna forget that.

265

I love you, kid.

266
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:40,032
And you take care of this girl 'cause she's a good kid.

267
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:43,202
She's a Weinstein, but now she's one of us.

Aunt Sadie and Aunt Lippie!

- So, darling, we love you. - Ah, sweet princess.

277
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,459
- We love you so much. - Darling.

278
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,427
- The light of our life. The heart... - The heart and soul.

279
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,796
- Oh, yes. - I'd bleed from every cell for you, Lisa.

280
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,565
- I'd cut off my arms and my legs for you. - Oh, yes.

281
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,967
- We would do anything for you. - Me and my torso, who cares?

282
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,268
You are the woman you are because of us.

283
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,304
We are your inspiration, you are our inspiration.

284
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,172
- We adore you, you're our angel. - We adore you.

285
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,775
- And just remember about marriage. - And the premiums.

286
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:23,909
Yes, and the premiums.

287
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,911
Marriage is like a soufflé.

288
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,114
Just because you cook with the same ingredients

289
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,182
doesn't mean it will rise to the occasion every time.

290
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,917
This is true, Lisa, darling, this is true.

291
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,252
Yes, and don't forget the insurance.

292
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:35,254
- The insurance and the premiums. - Premiums.

293
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,923
- Don't forget, honey, sweetheart, no matter what. - Every three months.

294
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,592
- The premiums must be paid. - Absolutely.

295
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,928
No payee, no playee. Remember this, darling. This is very important.

296
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,364
Take it from your Aunt Sadie, who loves you so much, and your Aunt Lippie.

297

[cheering and applause]

304
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,949
I'm pretty lucky to be here today. I just got outta the hospital.

305
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:07,119
I was in a motorcycle accident, I had what they called a fractured coccyx.

306
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,288
Wasn't familiar with medical terms.

307
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:12,124
I just thought that was a nice way of saying something else.

308
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:15,861
So when I was in the hospital, I called for the nurse 'cause I was all in traction,

309
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:18,197
and I pushed the button, I said, "What's all this?"

310
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,499
She says, "Oh, you've got a fractured coccyx,"

311
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,302
and I said, "Well, will I ever be able to use it again?"

312
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,471
She laughed, she went, "Ha ha, you know where it is?"

313
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,973
I said, "Well, I know where it was before I got here."

314
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,142
So anyway, that's besides the point,

315
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,012
but anyway, Bobby, I wish you a hell of a lot more luck than what I have,

316
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,014
and whatever you do, keep an eye on that

317
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,149
because if you ruin that in the beginning of the marriage,

318

you're gonna have a problem.

526
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,239
Hey, Hebber.

527
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:30,175
Let me sit in with your orchestra for a while.

528
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,011
Uh, yeah, maybe later, man.

529
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:34,746
Maybe later. Just come on back up.

You know, rock... rock out, man.

00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,885
- Let me sit in with your orchestra. - Later.

00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,689
I'm yeast intolerant. Everything here is yeast.

533
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:45,991
What about the salt?

534
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,193
Salt's making my fingers look like sausages.

535
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:50,595
- Viennas. - Vienna sausages?

536
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,597
You think the rings... the rings won't come off?

537

I went to Weight Watchers. You know what happened?

538
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,601
I didn't go to the meetings, I gained three pounds.

539
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,170
- Oh, God. - 'Cause you gotta go to the meetings.

540
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,205
That's why I can't get in this dress, I can't breathe.

So nice to see you.

551
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,627
- Wow! - Good to see you too.

552
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,896
- Wow. - Especially fun watching you announce dead people.

553
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,731
- Good move. - I'm getting good at that, huh?

554
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,900
- Yeah. - I think I should put out a record.

00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,036

00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,972
Get a lot of them, anyway.

558
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:35,173
So, uh...

559
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,177
You still like me? You still like me?

- I guess so. - I guess. Whatever, whatever.

561
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,550
Used to like me a lot.

562
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:48,253
- [giggles] - Do you know we never broke up?

563
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:50,589
That's so funny, I was thinking about this the other day.

564
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:53,558
Actually, this morning, when I got up, I was driving over here, I was thinking,

565
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,927
we never-- like we never officially broke up.

566
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:59,231
- Max-- - Which means that this marriage really isn't real.

567
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:02,033
Max, it's real-- Hold on a second, okay? It's real.

568
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:04,202
What did you come over here to tell me this stuff for, okay?

569
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,037
I thought you came over here to tell me good luck.

570
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:08,273
- So wish me luck, say, "Good luck." - Good luck!

571
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:10,876
Okay, good, I'm officially breaking up with you now, it's over.

572
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:11,943
- You can't do that! Lis-- - Shh!

573
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,678
There are people listening.

574
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:15,847
Listen, listen, listen.

575
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:19,284
You can't break up with someone when you're married to somebody else,

576
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:22,354
especially when the someone you didn't break up with was not broken up with you

577
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:24,122
when you went ahead and got married to somebody else.

578
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:26,691
- [groans] - First you break up, then you get married.

579
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:30,095
Max, I'm in love and not with you, okay?

580
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:31,897
You know what I think?

581
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,733
I th-think you are in love, you are in love.

582
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:37,102
But you're in love with the idea of being married.

583
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:38,937
So...

584
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,973
Yes, so you're in love with Michael When.

585
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,909
- You married When. - What?

586
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,878
- This guy Steve, I'm sure-- - His name is Bobby, okay?

587
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:48,914
I'm sure he's a great guy 'cause he's with you.

588
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,715
He's very lucky to be with you.

589
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,784
But... you had this space.

590
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:55,120
You got to this place and time, and you went, "Oh!

591
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,289
I should be married, and I'm not married."

592
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:58,890
So Todd filled that space.

593
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:01,593
His fucking name is Bobby.

594
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,094
Yeah, him too.

595
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:05,063
So you married Bobby as When.

596
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:06,898
You married When, you didn't marry Who.

597
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:07,933
You married When.

598
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:09,067
Oh, Max!

599
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,936
- There she is! - [giggles]

600
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,837
Hey, Bobby!

601
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,940
- What's up? - How you doing? How's it going?

602
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,409
- Max Tune, Bobby Benigni. Bobby Benigni... - Hey, nice to meet you.

603
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:20,845
I was wondering, you know, when I was gonna finally meet you.

604
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:24,282
I guess when is now.

605
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,985
Well, it's, uh... it's really nice to meet you...

606
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,253
- Yeah. - Max the Tune.

607
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:31,923
And thanks for playing here, and you guys sound really good.

608
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,792
Thanks, thanks. Hey, congratulations.

[glasses rattling]

611
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:37,996
I think you guys are missing a cue.

612
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,998
Yeah, this is our cue, honey. Our cue.

613
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:41,666
[mouthing words]

614
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,335
Get in here.

615
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,337

00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,874
- [whispering] - This fish is not...

618
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,876
- It's disgusting. - ...it's not from today.

619
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,945
- I can't eat it. - This fish is not from today.

620
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,947
Look at them eating the food over there.

621
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:58,283
- How about this little twig? - Why would they eat the food?

622
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:01,286
- Does she eat? - She doesn't eat. She throws it all up.

623
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,288
- I know. - She sticks a finger down her throat.

624
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:05,724
- She does, she sticks a finger down... - She does not.

625
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:09,127
Yes, she does, she sticks her finger down her throat.

626
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,829
They're talking about us, I can tell.

627
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,330
- No, they're not. - Yes, they are.

628
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,232
What a moon on her.

629
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,368
Mink!

630
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:19,304
Looks like the Holland Tunnel and the Lincoln Tunnel.

631
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:22,807
- Huh? - I can't stand that fuckin' guy.

632
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:25,310
[softly] Fuck you, fuck you.

633
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,145
I look like a sausage.

634
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,180
Just such a fucking bitch, that one over there.

635
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:31,249
- You are not fat. - I am fat.

636
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:33,818
- I am so bloated, I could scream. - I'm fat.

637
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:37,889
Testing, testing, 1, 2, 3. Can you all hear me?

638
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:42,160
My name is Rabbi Manny Shevetz,

639
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:45,163
and I am very pleased that you invited me

640
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,998
to be with you today,

641
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:51,002
and I've prepared a few words for this important occasion.

642
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:55,006
Today we celebrate life,

643
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,743
a very sacred part of life.

644
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:02,047
I remember when I used to walk down

645
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,749
my old neighborhood in Brooklyn.

646
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:08,019
That was before the Dodgers went to Los Angeles,

647
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,522
which was the worst thing, the worst thing that ever happened,

648
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:13,024
and I don't know why we let them do that.

649
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:16,061
I mean, nowadays there is no pride.

650
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,963
You don't know who owns what team,

651
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,932
you don't know who's playing for what.

652
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,034
Today they're here one day and they're gone the next day.

653
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,203
It's a terrible thing.

654
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:29,040
I remember when the Dodgers played the Yankees,

655
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:32,110
and you bought a ticket, that ticket was good for ten years.

656
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:35,313
Now we go to the stadium and you look out on the field

657
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:38,049
and you see the Red Sox, you see the Orioles,

658
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,551
you see the Cleveland Indians,

659
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,152
you see everything,

660
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:45,390
but you don't see the Yankees versus the Red Sox.

661
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:48,893
Okay, I'm getting a little bit off the track here.

662
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,929
But let me not take any more of your time.

663
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:53,231
Just one quick thought.

664
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:56,167
Oh, by the way, that free agency,

665
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,503
free agency crap, that really gets me.

666
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:02,073
That's $2 million here. They spend $12 million there.

667
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,909
What's so free about that free agency?

668
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,579
I... I can't take that anymore.

669
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:11,349
Okay, let me just make my point here,

670
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:13,918
and that is...

671
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:17,422
all in all, it's not so bad.

672
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:20,458
When it's good, it's good.

673
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:24,963
If it doesn't feel right, just say no.

674
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:29,801
There's always tomorrow.

675
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:32,537
There's always tomorrow.

676
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,874
It could be worse.

677
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,476
Now let's just thank God

678
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:41,446
you have your arms, you have your legs.

679
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:43,114
Let's eat!

680
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,116
[guests] L'chaim!

681
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,185
- [Italian accent] Hello. - Hello.

682
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:50,555
I would like, how do you say, vino?

683
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:53,191
- We say wine. - Yes.

684
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:55,627
And for you I've got a really good bottle.

685
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,061
Just fine, thank you.

686
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,966
So, where are you from, Staten Island, Brooklyn?

687
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,036
No. No, no, no, no. I'm from Italy.

688
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,038
- Italy, oh, I'm Italian. - Really?

689
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:08,907
- Sì. - Where from?

690
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,142
Well, not-- I'm not from Italy, okay?

691
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:12,644

00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:41,859
and, Bobby, you're the luckiest guy in the world.

865
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:43,094
Just take care of her, okay?

866
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:44,362
Okay? God bless youse.

867
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:47,431
But there's one thing I gotta tell youse all right now, okay?

868
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:50,001
'Cause it's something that's eating away at me for a long time, okay?

869
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:52,603
My name is Anthony Toscano, okay?

870
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:53,771
- MAN: Jesus. - Toscano.

871
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,973
Some of you know maybe Anthony T.

872
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:58,442
T, as in Toscano, you know?

873
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:00,011
I went to college, I worked hard.

874
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,779
I got myself right through college.

875
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:04,115
I got a good job, a regular job. I never went to jail.

876
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:06,050
- [blows raspberry] - Okay? But yet, still,

877
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,019
some of you, you don't understand

878
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,354
that there's an Anthony Cappelli you call Anthony C.

879
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,690
That's not me, that's somebody else, okay?

880
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:14,458
I didn't do no robberies.

881
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,827
I didn't get caught, I didn't get banged out, nothing.

882
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:18,863
- [jeering] - Okay? I got a regular job.

883
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:21,032
You understand that everybody-- Hey, respect.

884
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:24,135
Now, just to straighten out one more time,

885
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,137
I'm gonna show you someth-- Come here, C.

886
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,706
- This is Anthony Cappelli. You see this mug over here? - [jeering]

887
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:30,641
This is Cappelli, okay?

888
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:32,543
This is T., Toscano.

889
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:35,880
Okay, college education, I didn't rob no banks, no problem.

890
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,715
You see, no child abuse or nothing.

891
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:39,750
This is Cappelli over here.

892
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:42,386
Now, please don't ever do this again 'cause you give me angina.

893
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,822
Okay? Thank you very much. God bless you all.

894
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:47,058
- [scattered applause, whooping] - Yo. Hold on a minute here.

895
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:48,693
Stop.

896
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:51,696
I just wanna say this about that.

897
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,397
Ain't that the beauty of life?

898
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,032
I mean, come on.

899
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:59,170
I ain't you, and you definitely ain't me.

900
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:00,771
T'ank God.

901
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,907
[tango playing]

902
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,188
He's looking good.

903
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:18,589
Who?

904
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,691
Max.

905
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,593
Diane, what are you trying to tell me?

906
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:25,429
[Diane screams]

907
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:26,864
Nothing, nothing.

908
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:29,033
I just miss having him around.

909
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,601
Smile.

910
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:35,439
[tango continues]

911
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,780
For a minute there, I thought you were sitting upside down.

912
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:03,601
[tango continues]

913
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:15,913
I can't believe it.

914
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:18,949
I mean, I've been alone a long time.

915
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:20,918
But, I mean, ever since I met you,

916
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:21,986
I mean, we can talk,

917
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:24,155
I could tell you everything about my whole life.

918
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,757
It's like I'm talking to my best friend.

919
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,759
I mean, you mean so much to me.

920
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:32,596
I mean, I know we've only known each other for a very short time,

921
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,167
but I'll tell ya, I feel like we've known each other forever.

922
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,469
I wanna die in your arms.

923
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:39,703
[chuckles]

924
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:45,176
That one works like a charm.

925
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,111
- Get outta here! - I swear.

926
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:49,480
They think you're sensitive, and then bing-bang-boom.

927
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:52,149
You're in, you're out. They don't know what hit 'em.

928
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:54,819
I sing. I know I sing well. I get guys when I sing.

929
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,120
- You get guys? - Always.

930
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,721
The kind of guys that you wanna get...

931
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:58,889
I can only imagine.

932
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:00,524
Musicians, singers.

933
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,026
Acch! Acch! Acch!

934
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:04,128
- Disgusting pigs. - Filthy.

935
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:05,796
- Pooh! Like pigs. - I hate them. Filth.

936
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,798
- And what about the businessmen? - Businessmen?

937
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,967
- Fact, fact. - Here's one that I got-- They're pigs.

938
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,969
I got this from a businessman one time.

939
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:15,739
- [snorting] - "How can it be that I have one heart for her

940
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:16,674
and one heart for you?

941
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:17,875
Is it possible?"

942
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:19,810
- No, it's not possible, ya pig! - Hello.

943
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:22,046
You guys are lame.

944
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,848
The challenge here is,

945
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,850
to have more than one babe at the same team.

946
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,251
It's like this...

947
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:28,719
you got two hearts:

948
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:30,821
one for her and one for you.

949
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:33,991
What's the matter with you? You're a family man, man.

950
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:37,061
No, the challenge is not to get caught.

951
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:38,329
What about this?

952
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:41,665
[Brooklyn accent] "I feel like a kid in a candy store, huh!

953
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,000
Oh, yeah!" [chuckles]

954
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:45,236
Oh, yeah? Well, let me tell you something.

955
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:49,840
The goods from this candy store do not come cheap, you fuck.

956
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,742
- Oh, yeah, baby. - That's right, you fuck.

957
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,745
You want some goods, I got your goods right over here, huh?

958
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:57,047
You got a sweet tooth, huh? You want a little candy?

959
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:58,349
- Yeah! - Come on, baby!

960
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:00,718
- You are special! - Get over here.

961
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,553
[overlapping come-on lines]

962
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:04,288
- Come and get it! - How much money you want?

963
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:06,557
- You're special! - Where you been all my life?

964
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,792
- Money, money... - I've been lookin' all over for ya.

965
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,361
We could go back to the gold system

966
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:12,563
because it was so hard to counterfeit, you know.

967
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,632
- Yeah. - I mean, look at this stuff we got today.

968
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:15,866
It's paper money.

969
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,035
It's fairly easy to duplicate this stuff.

970
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:19,870
- Yeah. - And before you know it,

971
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,872
we're gonna be two-legged debit cards running around

972
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:23,874
- on an electronic reservation... - Sure, sure.

973
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:25,709
...leaving a trail wherever we are.

974
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,811
Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt,

975
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:30,781
but I couldn't help but overhear what you were talking about,

976
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:32,816
when you were talking about money.

977
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,119
People are always talking about money,

978
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:37,288
but they're always talking about the color of money.

979
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:39,957
Hello? What about the smell of money?

980
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:42,826
Have you ever smelled a dollar bill?

981
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,295
Do you know what it smells like?

982
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:46,297
It's the smell of America.

983
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,299
It's the smell of capitalism.

984
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:52,770
A sweat of... of success, of failure.

985
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:54,838
Oh, there's nothing like it.

986
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:59,743
You know, women like men with money.

987
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:02,346
But not for the reason you think.

988
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:05,182
It's for the smell.

989
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:09,687
Right now, I can predict how much money each of you have in your pocket

990
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,755
just by smelling you.

991
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,091
I got into this whole smell thing

992
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:15,659
because of my boyfriend.

993
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:17,261
He was a bartender.

994
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:19,997
Much like that guy over there.

995
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:23,200
So much money would pass through his hands.

996
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:24,268
By the end of the night...

997
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:25,769
[sniffs]

998
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:28,172
...it smelled as if he worked in a bank.

999
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:31,041
[sniffs] Oh, my God, I could smell his hand for hours.

1000
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,444
And then I'd go home, and he would just...

1001
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:35,946
he would just rub his hands all over me,

1002
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,281
and I could smell it,

1003
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:39,049
and he would rub it,

1004
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,985
and then, and then by the end of the night,

1005
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:44,655
I would smell like a fat roll of $100 bills.

1006
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,325
And he had great-smelling farts.

1007
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:54,231
I don't know, I don't smell anything. Do you smell anything?

1008
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:56,333
- [women chatting, laughing] - LISA: Hurry up! Hurry up!

1009
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:58,469
[all shouting]

1010
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:00,337
No, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1011
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:02,339
- Ugggh! - Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1012
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:04,808
- WOMAN 1: Oh, my God. - WOMAN 2: Help her.

1013
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:07,745
- [urinating] - WOMAN 3: Got it?

1014
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:10,381
WOMAN 4: Do you want us to get out so you can pee?

1015
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:13,984
Yeah, listen, what I do is, I come in, I take the pictures,

1016
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:16,086
I get everything, and then... [clicks tongue] ...I'm out.

1017
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,489
I mean, I'm just looking for some interaction,

1018
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:20,057
social interaction,

1019
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,759
and I don't understand

1020
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:23,327
why, when I say something,

1021
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,031
it comes out wrong or something, nobody understands it, you know.

1022
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:30,000
It's... Do you know what I mean at all?

1023
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:34,071
I mean, it's... it's like, I say something and people--

1024
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:36,373
I don't wanna give people bullshit.

1025
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:38,409
I don't like giving women bullshit, but...

1026
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:40,244
but it just seems to come out that way.

1027
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:42,179
[laughing]

1028
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:44,281
Hey, you know that loser at the bar, Vic DeMann?

1029
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:47,017
- Yeah. - He's actually married I heard, with kids.

1030
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:49,420
- Why does that not surprise me? - He disgusts me.

1031
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:52,856
I mean, come on, he tried to hit on me on my own freakin' wedding day.

1032
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:54,191
- No, did he? - Yes!

1033
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:56,193
- Oh, my God, please. - He hit on me.

1034
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:58,128
I'm gonna just have to kick his ass, you know?

Yeah, but I gotta admit, you know what?

1039
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:09,873
- Bobby does like it when I hoist these girls up a bit. - The girls?

1040
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:12,042
Let me tell you a little story.

1041
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:14,211
It takes place in Stowe, Vermont,

1042
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:16,046
where I almost played my first wedding.

1043
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,314
I was standing in the back of the tent,

1044
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:19,383
with my drummer.

1045
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:22,052
It was a beautiful day. Blue skies, green mountains.

1046
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:24,822
You know, it's the place where they shot "Sound of Music."

1047
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:27,391
And the bride and the groom

1048
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:30,227
were taking their vows in front of like 400 people.

1049
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,229
Looked like nothing really could go wrong.

1050
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:36,834
It was perfect, it was a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful day.

1051
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:38,569
Suddenly the bride stopped.

1052
00:45:38,602 --> 00:45:40,771
She turned around and she said, "Before I go any further,

1053
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:43,073
I'd like to thank my parents

1054
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:45,242
for teaching me about unconditional love.

1055
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:48,011
I also want to think my fiancé's parents

1056
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:51,415
for teaching me about honesty.

1057
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:53,784
But if this schmuck thinks I'm gonna spend

1058
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:56,186
the rest of my life with him, he's got another thing coming."

1059
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,489
Now, everybody in the room went, "Oooh."

1060
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:00,991
These things don't happen, but this did.

1061
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:05,095
Without missing a beat,

1062
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:08,132
my drummer leaned into me and said,

1063
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:09,967
"Hey, man, are we getting paid or what?"

1064
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:14,938
Later on, I spoke to one of the bridesmaids.

1065
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,940
She said the night before,

1066
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:20,611
the maid of honor and the groom...

1067
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:24,014
you know, did a little thing.

[sighs] Well, the morning of the wedding,

1069
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,552
the maid-of-honor went to the bride's door at the inn where she was staying

1070
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:30,120
and she knocked on the door and she said,

1071
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:31,522
"Listen, you can do whatever you want.

1072
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:33,457
You can marry this guy, you can break--

1073
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:36,326
whatever you wanna do, but you need to know what happened last night."

1074
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,062
- Oh, my, I can't believe she told her! - Forget about telling her.

1075
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:41,899
- I can't believe she did that. That's where it got screwed up. - What a slut.

1076
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:44,001
Big-time. Big-time slut.

1077
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:47,871
- Slut? - That would be a great story to sell for a talk show.

1078
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:50,874
- You should call Ricki Lake. - Don't waste it on a stupid talk show.

1079
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:53,343
- It's totally Woody Allen. - No, that would never happen.

1080
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:56,013
Take it from me, I walked down the aisle today,

1081
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:59,483
and I couldn't have done it unless I really, really felt safe, you know?

1082

I mean, if there was one iota of a doubt,

1083

1725
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:26,915
You know, when I was a kid, all my friends formed a band

1726
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:28,317
and... [clears throat]

1727
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:30,118
...I was gonna join the band,

1728
01:16:30,152 --> 01:16:32,020
but then my father says, "Your mother's very upset."

1729
01:16:32,054 --> 01:16:34,990
- Mm. - And I said, uh...

1730
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:37,759
And I said, uh... "Ma, what's the matter?"

1731
01:16:37,793 --> 01:16:40,362
She said, "I was thinking of you becoming a priest, you know."

1732
01:16:40,395 --> 01:16:43,198
So it was music or the church.

1733
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:45,834
- Music or the church. - Mm-hmm.

1734
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:47,936
And I chose the church, and I really envy you

1735

Not even to be like your father, 'cause your father made some mistakes.
