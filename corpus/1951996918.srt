00:02:04,896 --> 00:02:07,300

- (Gasp)

3
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:18,464
Hello.. hello?

4
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:21,649
Oh, hi.

5
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:26,748
Oh, I'm wide awake.
What's up?

6
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:30,404
Sources are telling us that
this decision was made...

7
00:02:30,405 --> 00:02:33,268
in the last few minutes at the precaution
and there is no indication...

8
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:36,295
that this airplane crash was
anything other than an accident.

9
00:02:36,296 --> 00:02:39,427
In any case, it is too soon to determine
whether the system malfunction...

10
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:42,543
was involved or whether human error was--

11
00:02:51,565 --> 00:02:52,705
- Hello, my dear.
- Hi.

12
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:53,706
It's freezing.

13
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:54,707
Thank you for coming so quickly.

14
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,098
Of course.
Thank you.

15
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:02,698
They came down on a beach, near Pinewood.
Just a handful were left, out of 109.

16
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:06,230
You should handle the whole group.

17
00:03:08,662 --> 00:03:08,911
Really?

18
00:03:08,912 --> 00:03:10,962
No, you're gonna have to trust
my judgment on this one.

19
00:03:11,302 --> 00:03:13,771
It's time to shake you out of this
comfort zone you're in.

20
00:03:14,514 --> 00:03:15,577
I'm not in a comfort zone.

21
00:03:15,578 --> 00:03:19,092
Two master's degrees, already?
Ph.D. that never ends?

22
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:21,602
That sounds pretty cozy to me.

23
00:03:25,553 --> 00:03:29,326
Okay, that's the start, mostly,
it's nothing new.

24
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:32,674
One will require little more work,
though. He's euphoric.

25
00:03:32,808 --> 00:03:35,944
He's feeling little
hmm... too good.

26
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:40,990
Uh...

27
00:03:43,786 --> 00:03:45,412
Oh!  I'm sorry--

28
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:03,474
Oh, excuse me, could you-- ?

29
00:04:16,232 --> 00:04:17,500
(sigh)

30
00:04:21,852 --> 00:04:23,061
Mr. Clark?

31
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,522
Come in!

32
00:04:27,952 --> 00:04:28,664
Mr. Clark.

33
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,534
I'm Eric.

34
00:04:31,073 --> 00:04:32,743
- Dr. Summers.
- Hi.

35
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,012
May I?

36
00:04:35,593 --> 00:04:37,436
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

37
00:04:38,484 --> 00:04:39,498
How are you feeling?

38
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:41,870
I feel great.

39
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,114
Mr. Clark, I'm a therapist.

40
00:04:43,115 --> 00:04:47,778
I'm recommending that the passengers
meet with me in group sessions.

41
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:49,698
You are?
Well, no thanks.

42
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:53,351
Oh, okay. I understand.

43
00:04:53,352 --> 00:04:57,116
If you'd feel more comfortable,
outside of the group environment...

44
00:04:57,117 --> 00:04:58,273
we could meet one on one.

45
00:04:58,274 --> 00:04:59,447
You make house calls?

46
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:04,339
Well, it's.. not.. protocol.. but.. hmm..
sometimes, under special circumstances.

47
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:08,352
What does one have to do to become
a "special circumstance" around here?

48
00:05:08,387 --> 00:05:11,062
Survive a plane crash?

49
00:05:11,097 --> 00:05:12,537
Uhmm..

50
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:17,593
You have a very lovely way about you.

51
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:19,646
Hmm?

52
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:21,531
I mean you're very formal,
but--

53
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:23,128
it's charming.

54
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:28,607
Is this your correct
contact information?

55
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,188
Okay.

56
00:05:31,312 --> 00:05:32,509
So, umm..

57
00:05:34,226 --> 00:05:35,284
Friday at five?

58
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:37,096
Tea time.

59
00:05:41,012 --> 00:05:41,543
Good.

60
00:05:43,852 --> 00:05:44,993
Is there anyone here for you?

61
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:49,770
- No.
- I can call someone if you.. want me to.

62
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:52,109
It's okay.

63
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:54,501
Feel better.

64
00:05:55,503 --> 00:05:56,598
(Chuckling) You, too.

65
00:06:00,497 --> 00:06:02,226
(Chuckling)

66
00:06:04,205 --> 00:06:05,313
Claire.

67
00:06:05,603 --> 00:06:06,286
Yes?

68
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,094
Do you have a sister?

69
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:12,945
Yes.

70
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,062
You should call her.

71
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:16,483
What?

72
00:06:16,683 --> 00:06:18,576
Better now than later.

73
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:21,766
You could step out front of a bus
or something, and then what?

74
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:32,928
(Sighs)

75
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:43,601
(Knocking)

76
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,432
- Hi.
- Hi.

77
00:06:49,632 --> 00:06:51,821
- Can I help you?
- Your laundry.

78
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:54,514
Oh, right, oh--

79
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,745
It was sitting in the dryer
for a while.

80
00:06:57,945 --> 00:07:00,549
Oh, I'm sorry, I had an emergency
at work, and I had to run out.

81
00:07:01,407 --> 00:07:03,924
Um, I've noticed that sometimes
you're too busy to pick up...

82
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:07,011
your newspapers, so I can take them
and hold them for you.

83
00:07:07,313 --> 00:07:09,287
Oh, no, no, it's fine.

84
00:07:09,802 --> 00:07:10,602
It's no bother.

85
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:14,915
Oh.. thank you.. but, you know what..
thank you, that's something...

86
00:07:15,096 --> 00:07:16,754
I promised myself
not to let happen again.

87
00:07:17,114 --> 00:07:18,521
- Okay, good night.
- Good night.

88
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,000
Claire?

89
00:07:20,254 --> 00:07:21,537
That's right.

90
00:07:22,586 --> 00:07:23,962
- Good night, Claire.
- Good night.

91
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:25,601
Anything you need,
you let me know.

92
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:27,122
Okay, thank you, bye.

93
00:07:31,838 --> 00:07:32,721
(Sigh)

94
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:36,796
(Sigh)

[Phone dialing]

96
00:07:40,843 --> 00:07:41,910
[Phone ringing]

97
00:07:42,143 --> 00:07:44,759
Hi, you've reached Hannah, Luke,
Paul, and Emma. Leave us a message.

98
00:07:47,584 --> 00:07:48,863
Hi.

99
00:07:51,094 --> 00:07:52,659
It's me.

100
00:07:55,713 --> 00:07:57,197
Just calling to say hi.

101
00:07:59,965 --> 00:08:00,877
Yeah, bye.

102
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,026
[Explosion]

103
00:08:09,163 --> 00:08:11,864
[Gasping]

104
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,935
[Dog barking]

105
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,217
I was at peace.

106
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,542
I always knew that I wouldn't live to
an old age so I just thought this is it.

107
00:08:42,983 --> 00:08:50,364
I looked around.. and just felt such
a pity for everyone.. all that fear.

108
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:51,692
Dean...

109
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:56,021
when did you first realize
that something was wrong?

110
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,718
Uh.. we were still up pretty high, and...

111
00:09:03,874 --> 00:09:06,674
plane was just cruising along,
and there was this sound...

112
00:09:07,487 --> 00:09:09,593
the lights went up and there was a flash--

113
00:09:09,744 --> 00:09:10,994
That's not what happened.

114
00:09:11,121 --> 00:09:13,733
There were no explosions
'till after we hit the ground.

115
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:15,028
No warning, nothing.

116
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:16,896
That's right.
It was when we were landing.

117
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,035
Don't tell me what I remember. Okay?

118
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:21,189
Shannon, Shannon...

119
00:09:22,047 --> 00:09:26,752
you said that you looked around
and you saw that fear...

120
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:31,837
but also that it was so sudden that..
you hit the ground without warning.

121
00:09:32,552 --> 00:09:33,582
So?

122
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,564
When exactly did you have that moment
to look around at the others?

123
00:09:39,072 --> 00:09:41,737
Does it matter?
Is this a test?

124
00:09:42,534 --> 00:09:45,351
No, of course, it's not a test.

125
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:53,423
Janice?

126
00:09:54,514 --> 00:09:56,010
Do you remember any of this?

127
00:10:04,158 --> 00:10:05,331
Dean...

128
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,842
there was something you said earlier
I really wanted to talk to you about...

129
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:09,651
beca--

130
00:10:16,697 --> 00:10:18,622
Excuse me for a second.

131
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,323
I'm afraid that's not what happened.

132
00:10:35,627 --> 00:10:39,082
The pilot misjudged the approach
and lost control.

133
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:42,339
Mistakes were made, unfortunately.

134
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:45,437
This passenger remembers fire on board,
maybe, before impact.

135
00:10:45,535 --> 00:10:50,148
But, isn't it common for..
people who are going through this...

136
00:10:50,213 --> 00:10:58,833
to be disoriented.. to be unsure
of what he saw.. even delusional.

137
00:10:58,996 --> 00:11:04,658
Yes, but it's also possible to be
in a heightened state of awareness...

138
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:07,090
where every details and
sensations are remembered.

139
00:11:10,605 --> 00:11:14,052
Dr. Summers,
let's try to be careful.

140
00:11:14,497 --> 00:11:17,489
I'm not trying to challenge any findings
or put the airliner on the spot.

141
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:19,925
I'm only thinking of the patients.

142
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,266
Accurate reconstruction of events is
essential to healing process, that's all.

143
00:11:28,435 --> 00:11:29,572
Thank you.

144
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:42,084
- Good day, doctor.
- Good day.

145
00:11:56,864 --> 00:11:58,942
Where are you? Where are you?

146
00:11:59,397 --> 00:12:00,477
[Knock]

147
00:12:02,883 --> 00:12:04,087
Hi, you scared me.

148
00:12:04,638 --> 00:12:05,867
What are you doing here, doctor?

149
00:12:07,099 --> 00:12:10,775
We have an appointment.
At.. umm.. here.

150
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:14,594
Oh, yeah, the house call.
I completely forgot.

151
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:16,647
No, it's okay.

152
00:12:18,157 --> 00:12:18,954
Wanna a fig?

153
00:12:19,398 --> 00:12:20,766
No, you should probably wash those.

154
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,496
So, let's just clear the air, okay?
I'm not anyone's patient, all right?

155
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,749
Okay.

156
00:12:52,077 --> 00:12:53,467
Cream and sugar for you.

157
00:13:00,662 --> 00:13:02,090
You are very attractive.

158
00:13:04,156 --> 00:13:05,246
Thank you.

159
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:11,737
Eric, you feel fine now,
ecstatic, even, it's common.

160
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:15,314
But.. when we go through
shocks to the system...

161
00:13:15,592 --> 00:13:17,583
there is often a repression
of negative feelings.

162
00:13:19,135 --> 00:13:22,179
Later on, these feelings will creep up
on you. There will be a balance due.

163
00:13:22,638 --> 00:13:23,741
Do you paint?

164
00:13:24,384 --> 00:13:25,565
No.

165
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,691
I always wanted to paint.

166
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:30,212
But I never dared.

167
00:13:32,086 --> 00:13:33,978
What kind of things would you paint?

168
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,371
(Chuckling)

169
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:38,113
God you just can't help yourself,
can you, doctor?

170
00:13:39,614 --> 00:13:41,075
Okay.

171
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:43,892
I did promise.

172
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:51,069
What do you do for work?

173
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:56,347
I'm a VP at Hein Dragg,
it's a brokerage firm.

174
00:13:58,127 --> 00:13:59,785
But I'm not going back to that.

175
00:14:01,102 --> 00:14:05,128
I've spent most of my life,
living the wrong way.

176
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,694
See my control towel, over here?

177
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:15,076
Printer, fax, high-speed Internet,
computers, e-mail, telephone, cell phone...

178
00:14:15,662 --> 00:14:20,076
multimessengers, it's horse-shit.

179
00:14:21,385 --> 00:14:24,037
Design to keep people away
from each other.

180
00:14:25,007 --> 00:14:27,623
Did you feel that way before..
before the accident?

181
00:14:28,762 --> 00:14:31,314
No, I was too busy working my ass off,
afraid of the rain.

182
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,016
So, you're re-evaluating your priorities.

183
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:38,952
Well put.

184
00:14:45,224 --> 00:14:48,779
Eric, it's really important that we mean
to revisit your experience.

185
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,575
Okay.

186
00:15:02,431 --> 00:15:04,705
What's the first thing that comes
to your mind about the accident?

187
00:15:11,098 --> 00:15:12,399
The wind in my face.

188
00:15:13,599 --> 00:15:16,477
Okay, what do you remember after that?

189
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:22,262
Walking the beach,
next to a rather large bonfire.

190
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:27,898
Can you remember anything else
between these two events?

191
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:34,367
One of the other passengers says that
he remembers bright light...

192
00:15:34,857 --> 00:15:36,332
or a loud noise, perhaps...

193
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:39,198
but something during the mid-flight.

194
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,682
It's okay to cry.

195
00:15:52,673 --> 00:15:54,060
I'm not gonna cry.

196
00:15:57,608 --> 00:15:58,985
Uhmm..

197
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:02,890
What else?

198
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:05,973
Are you sleeping?

199
00:16:06,952 --> 00:16:08,192
Of course.

200
00:16:09,627 --> 00:16:10,998
Any dreams?

201
00:16:11,574 --> 00:16:12,882
I don't remember.

202
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,332
Stick around, I will awake you
when I'm having one.

203
00:16:19,254 --> 00:16:20,532
No thanks.

204
00:16:21,307 --> 00:16:22,616
Why not?

205
00:16:22,886 --> 00:16:24,314
I don't know.

206
00:16:24,823 --> 00:16:27,021
It's frowned upon in
my professional community.

207
00:16:27,206 --> 00:16:28,562
Isn't that silly?

208
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:30,313
It is silly.

209
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:33,165
Directions to the group meeting.

210
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:35,112
You should come by, Eric,
you won't regret it.

211
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,951
You're like a dog with a bone.

212
00:16:40,176 --> 00:16:41,524
Thanks for the coffee.

213
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:46,237
Hey, Claire.

214
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:51,024
Drop by any time.

215
00:17:25,892 --> 00:17:28,134
Did you mention me to Eric Clark
before I came along?

216
00:17:28,312 --> 00:17:29,558
- No.
- No?

217
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,363
I've never met him.

218
00:17:31,897 --> 00:17:33,637
He knows personal things about me.

219
00:17:33,854 --> 00:17:35,025
Like what?

220
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:38,414
Not any big things, how to
take my coffee, that I have a sister.

221
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,504
How does he explain it?

222
00:17:40,878 --> 00:17:42,930
No, he hasn't tried,
and I haven't asked.

223
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:44,191
How is your sister?

224
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,443
Uhmm..

225
00:17:45,492 --> 00:17:46,310
Emma?

226
00:17:46,362 --> 00:17:47,312
Emma, right.

227
00:17:47,372 --> 00:17:48,741
- She's good.
- She's good?

228
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:51,530
She's good. Yeah...

229
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:54,940
I've been doing some research
on some PTSD patients...

230
00:17:54,985 --> 00:17:59,372
that may have developed
an extrasensory perception.

231
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:00,676
Really?

232
00:18:00,761 --> 00:18:03,190
It's a.. theory.

233
00:18:03,191 --> 00:18:05,505
Most of combat veterans.

234
00:18:06,974 --> 00:18:10,959
So, he's a..
so, he's reading your mind.

235
00:18:12,715 --> 00:18:13,660
Hmm?

236
00:18:15,648 --> 00:18:16,743
- Yes?
- All right, all right.

237
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:18,398
(Chuckling)

238
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,501
Claire.

239
00:18:27,015 --> 00:18:29,327
Did they even find any more information
about what happened up there?

240
00:18:30,081 --> 00:18:31,232
Why do you ask?

241
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:34,491
Well, their initial assessments
are all over the place.

242
00:18:34,593 --> 00:18:37,152
This one passenger, Dean Haschle,
he seems to remember...

243
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:40,776
an explosion on board.
None of the others agree.

244
00:18:40,837 --> 00:18:42,157
They all have a different story.

245
00:18:42,198 --> 00:18:44,762
There's bound to be some discrepancies.

246
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:47,944
An explosion would cause
an accident, not a pilot error.

247
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,785
I spoke to a man at the airline, and
he seemed pretty annoyed by this theory.

248
00:18:52,392 --> 00:18:55,205
- And..
- Stop, stop, stop. You're not a detective.

249
00:18:56,192 --> 00:18:58,869
Stick to your patients,
and their progresses. That's it.

250
00:18:59,796 --> 00:19:04,551
Okay, fair enough, but the huge part of
their progress will be knowing the truth.

251
00:19:04,584 --> 00:19:07,196
'The truth heals,' who said that?

252
00:19:07,225 --> 00:19:09,109
I don't know, some dead white guy.

253
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:10,892
No, you.

254
00:19:12,981 --> 00:19:14,359
Well, how are you finding the work?

255
00:19:14,604 --> 00:19:18,022
Well, I should have been doing
this long time ago, well, you knew that.

256
00:19:19,528 --> 00:19:20,987
Better late than never, I guess.

257
00:19:21,653 --> 00:19:24,540
This is good. This is good.

258
00:19:39,249 --> 00:19:41,645
Does anyone have a contact
with Dean since our last session?

259
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,593
Not surprised that he isn't back.

260
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,023
I don't think this little
get-togethers are any use...

261
00:19:48,825 --> 00:19:50,438
spilling your guts to strangers.

262
00:19:51,115 --> 00:19:57,164
Shannon.. have you tried talking
to your friends or relatives...

263
00:19:57,189 --> 00:19:58,833
about what you're feeling?

264
00:19:58,885 --> 00:20:00,902
Loved ones could be great source of comfort.

265
00:20:00,948 --> 00:20:02,134
Nope.

266
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:03,703
Are you all right?

267
00:20:04,176 --> 00:20:05,503
I'm good.

268
00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:12,218
I'm little tired.

269
00:20:12,548 --> 00:20:14,235
Are you sleeping well?

270
00:20:16,788 --> 00:20:17,941
Not really.

271
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:22,640
We can talk to a physician
and get you something to help you sleep.

272
00:20:24,517 --> 00:20:25,532
No.

273
00:20:30,683 --> 00:20:31,631
Good night, Shannon.

274
00:20:34,344 --> 00:20:37,854
Do you always offer medication
in front of other patients?

275
00:20:38,844 --> 00:20:39,871
Oh, Shannon, I'm sorr--

276
00:20:40,168 --> 00:20:42,492
What qualifies you,
really, to talk to us?

277
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:45,495
You have no idea
what any of us are going through.

278
00:21:08,515 --> 00:21:09,228
Doctor!

279
00:21:09,783 --> 00:21:10,388
Norman?

280
00:21:10,573 --> 00:21:11,447
In your car, please.

281
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,718
- What's the matter?
- Let's go. C'mon.

282
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:14,116
Norman.

283
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:18,813
Please! Just bear with me.

284
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:24,024
Okay. Okay.

285
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,814
Just pull out here, and make this U-turn.

286
00:21:31,142 --> 00:21:32,144
Why?

287
00:21:34,582 --> 00:21:36,607
Dr. Summers, please.

288
00:21:38,343 --> 00:21:39,453
Okay.

289
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:41,395
Put on your seatbelt.

290
00:21:56,806 --> 00:21:57,679
Where are we going?

291
00:21:57,805 --> 00:21:59,807
Drive past that building,
but don't stop.

292
00:21:59,926 --> 00:22:00,408
Okay.

293
00:22:10,825 --> 00:22:12,273
There!
There, he is.

294
00:22:17,993 --> 00:22:19,177
That man was here the other day.

295
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:20,923
He's been following me.

296
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:22,978
Who is he?

297
00:22:23,371 --> 00:22:25,963
I think he's with airlines.
They've been monitoring us.

298
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:28,155
Why.. why would they do that?

299
00:22:28,379 --> 00:22:32,565
The other night, when Dean said
he remembered a flash...

300
00:22:32,637 --> 00:22:36,997
or something bright,
like a fire, or an explosion...

301
00:22:38,254 --> 00:22:39,726
it started coming back to me.

302
00:22:41,478 --> 00:22:44,095
They're saying that the pilot missed
the approach or some bullshit.

303
00:22:45,062 --> 00:22:47,024
That's wrong.

304
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,586
There was an explosion on board,
I remember it now, too.

305
00:22:51,728 --> 00:22:53,856
Why would they lie
about something like that?

306
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:57,433
They had another accident, last year,
off the coast of California.

307
00:22:57,593 --> 00:23:00,587
A mechnical failure, another problem
like that would sink them.

308
00:23:01,674 --> 00:23:03,330
They're after us now.

309
00:23:03,763 --> 00:23:06,364
Norman, we can't assume that.

310
00:23:06,491 --> 00:23:08,845
You don't know these people.
A corporation like this...

311
00:23:08,948 --> 00:23:12,181
it's all about money, they are capable
of anything to save their asses.

312
00:23:12,555 --> 00:23:15,685
Norman, I understand that you feel
vulnerable right now...

313
00:23:15,749 --> 00:23:19,591
and paranoid feelings are common
amongst people who have been through...

314
00:23:19,622 --> 00:23:22,415
what you've just been through, but.. uh...

315
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:26,903
I don't think the airline is
after you, okay?

316
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,593
Let me take you home, where do you live?

00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:07,420
Eric.

359
00:27:11,611 --> 00:27:12,372
Eric.

360
00:27:14,406 --> 00:27:15,949
Eric, c'mon, please talk to me.

361
00:27:16,245 --> 00:27:17,724
Please tell me
what you're feeling right now.

362
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:19,284
What?!  C'mon.

363
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:39,447
How have you been?

364
00:27:40,704 --> 00:27:41,448
How are things?

365
00:27:42,135 --> 00:27:43,967
- I'm okay.
- Yeah?

366
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,552
Yeah.

367
00:27:45,887 --> 00:27:47,808
You seem little depressed to me.

368
00:27:48,384 --> 00:27:49,546
Are you?

369
00:27:51,721 --> 00:27:53,009
No.

370
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:55,874
Why would you say that?

371
00:27:56,051 --> 00:28:01,907
I don't know, I just..
you.. saw.. put together.

372
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:08,436
I have a theory about women who
are beautiful, 'cause you're beautiful...

373
00:28:08,637 --> 00:28:12,623
who bury themselves under
layers of crap, like you do.

374
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,790
I don't bury myself.

375
00:28:13,877 --> 00:28:15,959
- Do you want to hear my theory or not?
- Fine.

376
00:28:17,694 --> 00:28:19,031
They're afraid of being desirable.

377
00:28:19,189 --> 00:28:21,967
How touchy feely,
maybe you should have your own show.

378
00:28:47,484 --> 00:28:48,901
Hey!

379
00:29:25,709 --> 00:29:26,622
Thank you.

380
00:29:26,775 --> 00:29:29,615
How did you come to do what you do?

381
00:29:29,553 --> 00:29:33,866
How does one become
an expert in disasters?

382
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:36,474
I study children with severe traumas.

383
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:39,403
Children who have shut-off.

384
00:29:40,017 --> 00:29:41,314
Where do you start?

385
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,629
Uh.. by learning their language.

386
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:53,255
Most of these kids dress up the facts
with fantasies, imaginary friends...

387
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:57,830
storytelling, I..
find my way into their story...

388
00:29:58,718 --> 00:30:00,422
and I find my way back to the truth.

389
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,135
Are you afraid of dogs?

390
00:30:21,172 --> 00:30:22,197
Of course, not.

391
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:25,374
Because, you know, it's common
among post-traumatic patients...

392
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:26,873
to develop phobias--

393
00:30:27,021 --> 00:30:28,832
Claire, I'm not your patient.

394
00:30:28,942 --> 00:30:30,607
I was using the term generally.

395
00:30:32,615 --> 00:30:34,055
Eric, can I see you again?

396
00:30:35,456 --> 00:30:38,288
Yeah.
Of course.

397
00:30:39,488 --> 00:30:41,369
In fact, you know what?
Here.

398
00:30:44,617 --> 00:30:46,715
It's a key.
It's not my hand in marriage.

399
00:30:46,826 --> 00:30:48,514
In case I can't hear
the doorbell or something.

400
00:30:48,578 --> 00:30:51,043
No, I will call first next time. That's
what I really should've done today.

401
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:54,628
- Sorry.
- C'mon, hey, slow down.

402
00:30:54,668 --> 00:30:56,253
I'm not gonna bite you.

403
00:30:57,851 --> 00:31:00,572
Look, I appreciate you wanting to help.

404
00:31:00,771 --> 00:31:04,718
I do. It's a.. it is helpful.

405
00:31:06,134 --> 00:31:07,862
It's comforting, thank you.

406
00:31:14,568 --> 00:31:16,961
Okay.
Some ground rules.

407
00:31:18,153 --> 00:31:21,849
We are not dating. We're having
conversations that may help you...

408
00:31:21,954 --> 00:31:23,842
release some of the feelings
that you're repressing.

409
00:31:23,976 --> 00:31:26,377
I would say my feelings
are not being repressed at all.

410
00:31:26,555 --> 00:31:29,275
I will listen to you, and
you will stop coming on to me.

411
00:31:30,778 --> 00:31:32,147
- All right?
- All right.

412
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:34,636
These are my terms now,
if we're going to continue hanging out.

413
00:31:36,508 --> 00:31:37,451
We're hanging out?

414
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:40,852
Yes, quid pro quo, tit for tat.

415
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,621
Tit for tat?

416
00:31:43,478 --> 00:31:44,373
Shut up.

417
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,021
Okay, doctor.

418
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:49,503
All right.

419
00:31:50,511 --> 00:31:52,419
- Bye, Eric.
- Something was in your mouth.

420
00:31:53,707 --> 00:31:54,957
Bye.

421
00:32:07,046 --> 00:32:08,342
'You have no messages.'

422
00:32:32,971 --> 00:32:34,236
Are you looking for this?

423
00:32:35,508 --> 00:32:36,237
Yep.

424
00:32:36,516 --> 00:32:38,107
It's so beautiful.

425
00:32:38,229 --> 00:32:39,379
Thank you.

426
00:32:40,068 --> 00:32:42,069
And you'd look beautiful in it, I bet.

427
00:32:43,573 --> 00:32:44,902
I don't know.. not sure.

428
00:32:45,773 --> 00:32:47,646
I'll just fold it.

429
00:32:48,413 --> 00:32:50,927
Oh, okay, thank you.

430
00:32:51,063 --> 00:32:52,494
Sure.

431
00:32:59,241 --> 00:33:00,368
Your key.

432
00:33:00,802 --> 00:33:01,583
Yeah.

433
00:33:01,682 --> 00:33:04,073
- A lover's key.
- No.

434
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:06,410
No, no, he's an acquaintance.

435
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:10,979
An acquaintance who gives away his key,
where do I sign up?

436
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:15,860
Actually, he's a patient, sort of.

437
00:33:16,891 --> 00:33:18,228
Do you like him?

438
00:33:19,324 --> 00:33:20,108
No.

439
00:33:20,564 --> 00:33:21,660
No?

440
00:33:22,132 --> 00:33:23,987
Look me in the eye and say that.

441
00:33:27,766 --> 00:33:29,438
I don't like him, he's a patient.

442
00:33:30,071 --> 00:33:32,822
So, even if I liked him,
it'd constitute a conflict of interests...

443
00:33:33,791 --> 00:33:35,777
- it's an ethical..
- Right...

444
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,079
- and then you'd have to stop seeing him.
- Right.

445
00:33:39,775 --> 00:33:41,391
And you'd have to put him
out of your mind.

446
00:33:41,671 --> 00:33:45,690
- Yeah.
- Right. I've lived like that.

447
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:47,922
Like what?

448
00:33:48,464 --> 00:33:52,412
Cautious, missing opportunities.

449
00:33:55,754 --> 00:33:57,276
Well, thanks so much for this.

450
00:33:58,771 --> 00:33:59,932
Have a good night.

451
00:34:00,027 --> 00:34:02,285
You, too, just.. just..

452
00:34:03,365 --> 00:34:04,396
Yeah?

453
00:34:05,468 --> 00:34:07,694
Spread your wings.

454
00:34:09,301 --> 00:34:11,702
Life's a moment.. just...

455
00:34:12,207 --> 00:34:13,536
it's done.

456
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:17,768
Oh, it is. Right.
Have a good night.

457
00:34:24,016 --> 00:34:26,777
[Knocking]

458
00:34:26,905 --> 00:34:29,337
Yeah? I'm coming.

459
00:34:37,148 --> 00:34:37,876
Eric?

460
00:34:38,731 --> 00:34:40,404
What's going on?
What's wrong?

461
00:34:40,723 --> 00:34:42,660
Oh? Uh... nothing.

462
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:45,997
How do you know where I live?

463
00:34:46,092 --> 00:34:47,949
It's in here.

464
00:34:48,054 --> 00:34:49,661
You left it in my place.

465
00:34:49,726 --> 00:34:51,255
I thought you might need it
for tomorrow.

466
00:34:51,814 --> 00:34:52,910
Sorry 'bout that.

467
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:54,488
No, it's okay.

468
00:34:54,664 --> 00:34:56,432
So, are you.. are you okay?

469
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,870
Are you gonna invite me in.. or.. ?

470
00:34:59,408 --> 00:35:00,191
No.

471
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:01,879
Got somebody in there?

472
00:35:01,952 --> 00:35:03,200
No.

473
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,617
I mean, it's not any of your business.

474
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,419
Anyway, this isn't my normal office hours.

475
00:35:09,603 --> 00:35:11,002
I'm not a patient.

476
00:35:12,356 --> 00:35:18,149
No, you're just a creepy guy standing
at my door in the middle of night.

477
00:35:18,469 --> 00:35:20,876
A lovely man. Intriguing.

478
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,053
Okay, good night.

479
00:35:23,214 --> 00:35:25,341
You don't think so?

480
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,270
I'm not gonna stand here
and debate your loveliness.

481
00:35:28,846 --> 00:35:30,671
How about the intriguing part?

482
00:35:31,111 --> 00:35:32,295
Good night.

483
00:35:33,368 --> 00:35:34,872
(sigh)

484
00:35:51,915 --> 00:35:53,540
[Knocking]

485
00:36:01,348 --> 00:36:02,436
Oh, hi.

486
00:36:03,069 --> 00:36:04,628
He's very handsome.

487
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,304
Okay.

488
00:36:24,121 --> 00:36:25,482
Let's get started.

489
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:27,442
Why aren't they here?

490
00:36:29,626 --> 00:36:32,258
C'mon, you always have
some kind of feel-good theory.

491
00:36:32,611 --> 00:36:34,495
What's your theory for this?

492
00:36:34,612 --> 00:36:36,204
Why are they missing?

493
00:36:44,095 --> 00:36:48,215
I'm so sorry. Would you mind
excusing me for a moment?

494
00:36:48,389 --> 00:36:49,751
Okay, go.

495
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:05,018
What are you doing here, Mr. Arkin?

496
00:37:06,128 --> 00:37:08,659
I'm interested in
the health of the passengers.

497
00:37:08,801 --> 00:37:10,835
You're interested in
what they remember.

498
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:13,179
Yes, of course I am.

499
00:37:18,622 --> 00:37:22,556
You're patients are highly susceptible
to external influences right now.

500
00:37:22,685 --> 00:37:27,494
So, you just be sure you haven't been
feeding them your own theories.

501
00:37:28,158 --> 00:37:30,735
Have you been able to confirm
that the accident was human error?

502
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:35,792
It's always a human error, doctor,
whichever way you turn it.

503
00:37:35,888 --> 00:37:39,504
Someone didn't work hard enough,
or well enough, or cared enough...

504
00:37:39,544 --> 00:37:41,688
someone made a mistake.

505
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,939
And in this case, it was an..
overworked pilot.

506
00:37:45,979 --> 00:37:48,137
You're blaming your woes to a dead man.

507
00:37:51,929 --> 00:37:53,820
Stay away. I mean it.

508
00:38:08,142 --> 00:38:09,215
Claire!

509
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:10,816
Eric?

510
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:13,417
Hey!

511
00:38:14,424 --> 00:38:17,177
Eric! Uh.. Eric.. okay...

512
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:19,682
stay away from the edge, okay?
What are you doing?

513
00:38:19,874 --> 00:38:20,610
Just..

514
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,330
Come on up!

515
00:38:23,146 --> 00:38:23,978
Uhm...

516
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,338
C'mon!

517
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,011
I'm not so good with heights.

518
00:38:28,796 --> 00:38:30,468
(Chuckling)

519
00:38:54,777 --> 00:38:55,578
Are you all right?

520
00:38:56,313 --> 00:38:57,826
No.. I.. I'm good. I'm just fine here.

521
00:38:58,506 --> 00:39:00,201
C'mon, come here. C'mon.

522
00:39:01,081 --> 00:39:02,697
Eric! Eric, stop it!

523
00:39:03,347 --> 00:39:05,579
I'm sorry. Okay. Here we go.

524
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:06,956
Do you have me?

525
00:39:07,907 --> 00:39:10,251
Oh, God. Jesus.

526
00:39:13,086 --> 00:39:14,246
- Stay there.
- I'm good.

527
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:31,968
We can't seem to stay away
from each other, can we?

528
00:39:35,993 --> 00:39:37,055
So, what's your sign?

529
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:43,113
(Laughing)

530
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:45,338
I was almost married once.

531
00:39:45,738 --> 00:39:48,219
I bailed two days before the wedding.

532
00:39:50,804 --> 00:39:52,363
That's...

533
00:39:52,499 --> 00:39:53,603
that's terrible.

534
00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:57,460
Yeah, it is.

535
00:39:58,236 --> 00:39:59,740
It was very painful for her.

536
00:40:02,644 --> 00:40:04,092
I was scared.

537
00:40:07,111 --> 00:40:09,406
You know what's scary about commitment?

538
00:40:10,807 --> 00:40:14,528
Your life becomes real.
It's not a plan.

539
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:17,696
It's not what you hope for.
It's real.

540
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,470
Your turn.

541
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:28,058
C'mon, give me something.
Fair is fair. Tit for tat.

542
00:40:28,571 --> 00:40:30,321
There is nothing to tell.

543
00:40:31,692 --> 00:40:34,076
I've never been close.
Sometimes, they left me.

544
00:40:34,197 --> 00:40:36,070
Sometimes, I left them.

545
00:40:37,614 --> 00:40:41,374
There is no sob story.
Not really.

546
00:40:42,992 --> 00:40:44,493
That was very you.

547
00:40:45,773 --> 00:40:47,862
Concise, yet vague.

548
00:40:48,053 --> 00:40:50,775
I'm not like that.
I like clarity.

549
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:53,879
Clarity for Claire.

550
00:40:54,367 --> 00:40:56,816
I'm so glad I'm amusing you.

551
00:40:58,295 --> 00:41:00,999
C'mon, this is miraculous, isn't it?
We're both sitting here?

552
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:05,856
That crash.

553
00:41:08,554 --> 00:41:11,394
It's like being born again.

554
00:41:22,308 --> 00:41:23,300
Eric?

555
00:41:24,172 --> 00:41:26,693
Eric! Oh, my God, Eric!

556
00:41:29,502 --> 00:41:30,502
What?

557
00:41:30,685 --> 00:41:33,710
You, bastard?!
You, fu--

558
00:41:34,665 --> 00:41:36,167
(Chuckling) C'mon.

559
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:51,682
Yeah.

560
00:41:51,865 --> 00:41:53,315
I'm not getting on that thing.

561
00:41:53,683 --> 00:41:55,010
Why not?

562
00:41:56,763 --> 00:41:57,995
You're not wearing a helmet?

563
00:41:59,035 --> 00:42:00,299
For crying out aloud, c'mon.

564
00:42:03,507 --> 00:42:05,196
Why did you come here tonight?

565
00:42:33,538 --> 00:42:34,706
Too fast for you?

566
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:36,282
No.

567
00:43:02,578 --> 00:43:06,556
Uh, so do we need safety vests?

568
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:10,124
There might be safety vests in there.

569
00:43:10,385 --> 00:43:12,477
Aren't they called life preservers?
Ah, perfect.

570
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:19,294
So, uh.. this is a nice boat.

571
00:43:19,902 --> 00:43:21,183
It is, isn't it?

572
00:43:21,606 --> 00:43:23,167
Yeah, how long have you had her?

573
00:43:23,255 --> 00:43:24,963
Oh, it's not mine.

574
00:43:25,016 --> 00:43:26,015
Then whose is it?

575
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:27,239
I have no idea.

576
00:43:27,288 --> 00:43:29,215
What?

577
00:43:29,321 --> 00:43:31,041
- What?
- Watch your head.

578
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:32,520
Eric.

579
00:43:33,305 --> 00:43:34,402
Can you drive a boat?

580
00:43:34,577 --> 00:43:35,882
Yeah.

581
00:43:36,001 --> 00:43:38,098
Great, that's wonderful.

582
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:45,323
Wanna take it?

583
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:46,883
Oh, no.

584
00:43:46,962 --> 00:43:48,572
C'mon.

585
00:43:52,125 --> 00:43:54,461
(Laughing)

586
00:43:54,709 --> 00:43:56,366
Follow the moon.

587
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,072
What are you doing?

588
00:44:07,279 --> 00:44:08,600
Going for a swim.

589
00:44:08,723 --> 00:44:11,367
What? Are you serious.. it's freezing.

590
00:44:11,712 --> 00:44:17,363
No, well.. yeah,
will be freezing for a moment.

591
00:44:17,474 --> 00:44:19,635
Then, it'll be okay.

592
00:44:25,523 --> 00:44:27,620
You're just looking
for thrills to feel alive...

593
00:44:27,819 --> 00:44:29,324
it's a normal reaction.

594
00:44:39,399 --> 00:44:40,775
Eric, is it cold?

595
00:44:45,615 --> 00:44:47,311
Okay, I'm not falling for this again.

596
00:44:47,407 --> 00:44:52,417
Eric! Seriously, it's not funny.
Stop it!

597
00:44:54,346 --> 00:44:59,459
Eric! Eric!  I'm coming,
I'm coming.

598
00:45:02,883 --> 00:45:04,201
Eric! Eric!

599
00:45:05,163 --> 00:45:07,082
You've scared the hell out of me!

600
00:45:08,766 --> 00:45:09,956
I thought you were drowning.

601
00:45:10,196 --> 00:45:11,350
No.

602
00:45:12,133 --> 00:45:13,597
Why are you wearing your clothes?

603
00:45:15,732 --> 00:45:17,126
Did you jump in to save me?

604
00:45:18,151 --> 00:45:19,078
No.

605
00:45:19,775 --> 00:45:21,581
Come here. Where are you going?

606
00:45:21,749 --> 00:45:24,015
C'mon, come back.
Stay a while.

607
00:45:24,558 --> 00:45:26,959
See. It's not so cold.

608
00:45:31,049 --> 00:45:33,897
No, it's not.
It's fine.

609
00:46:45,262 --> 00:46:47,606
(Chuckling)

610
00:46:48,246 --> 00:46:49,255
Oh, God.

611
00:46:49,725 --> 00:46:50,590
What?

612
00:46:50,736 --> 00:46:51,909
I'm a mess.

613
00:46:54,224 --> 00:46:56,039
- Too late, Claire.
- For what?

614
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,105
To scare me away.

615
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:06,889
Eric...

616
00:47:07,929 --> 00:47:11,049
the first time we met,
you asked me if I had a sister.

617
00:47:15,028 --> 00:47:16,228
Do you have one?

618
00:47:16,692 --> 00:47:17,916
Yeah.

619
00:47:18,428 --> 00:47:20,565
Yeah, you seemed to know that.

620
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:25,509
Maybe, is that, bossy,
older sister thing you've got--

621
00:47:25,725 --> 00:47:27,069
Not.. you're..

622
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,872
Anyway, Emma's older.

623
00:47:35,177 --> 00:47:36,569
What is she like?

624
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:45,354
She's an activist, a risk-taker.

625
00:47:49,484 --> 00:47:50,980
She's a really good mom.

626
00:47:52,724 --> 00:47:54,525
She's got many things.

627
00:47:55,509 --> 00:47:57,061
Ah...

628
00:47:58,726 --> 00:48:00,566
so, what's the problem?

629
00:48:01,542 --> 00:48:04,798
She called me a coward,
and said that I was wasting my life.

630
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:08,830
I said some pretty horrible things to her.

631
00:48:11,672 --> 00:48:14,273
Stuff I shouldn't have said,
stuff that I--

632
00:48:15,561 --> 00:48:18,001
Anyway, we haven't spoken in months.

633
00:48:18,986 --> 00:48:20,794
Whatever was said...

634
00:48:22,242 --> 00:48:24,147
it's not worth it.

635
00:49:20,494 --> 00:49:22,014
[Doorbell rings]

636
00:49:25,279 --> 00:49:26,823
[Doorbell rings]

637
00:49:30,464 --> 00:49:31,455
Emma?

638
00:49:48,099 --> 00:49:49,683
[Bird chirping]

639
00:50:14,153 --> 00:50:15,471
Who lives here, Claire?

640
00:50:17,786 --> 00:50:19,058
Are you following me?

641
00:50:19,161 --> 00:50:22,337
Is spending nights with your patients
regular part of your therapy?

642
00:50:25,746 --> 00:50:28,339
Your credibility is on a shaky ground.

643
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:45,182
Perry.

644
00:50:45,862 --> 00:50:46,518
Claire.

645
00:50:46,622 --> 00:50:50,071
Perry.. ah.. hm...

646
00:50:50,103 --> 00:50:52,439
there is a man
following me and my patient.

647
00:50:52,919 --> 00:50:56,393
Two men, actually.
Arkin from the airline...

648
00:50:56,449 --> 00:51:00,521
and another one, one of them thinks..
that.. I mean.. one of my patients...

649
00:51:00,569 --> 00:51:03,274
Norman, he thinks the other one is
from the airline, and...

650
00:51:03,305 --> 00:51:07,379
I don't know, there is some kind
of cover-up going on...

651
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:09,211
and two of my patients are missing.

652
00:51:09,314 --> 00:51:11,819
Claire, Claire, slow down.

653
00:51:12,507 --> 00:51:13,772
Who's missing?

654
00:51:13,811 --> 00:51:15,750
Norman and Dean.

655
00:51:16,501 --> 00:51:17,732
They've been missing sessions.

656
00:51:18,781 --> 00:51:21,894
They're missing,
or they missed sessions?

657
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:24,534
I'm not sure.

658
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:28,366
Well, just because they're not at
the sessions doesn't mean...

659
00:51:28,156 --> 00:51:29,237
they're in trouble.

660
00:51:30,032 --> 00:51:31,895
And patients fall in and out
of the desire for treatment...

661
00:51:31,919 --> 00:51:33,983
all the time, isn't that common?

662
00:51:34,014 --> 00:51:35,607
Absolutely, right.

663
00:51:36,279 --> 00:51:37,783
What about Eric Clark?

664
00:51:37,824 --> 00:51:39,496
What?

665
00:51:39,521 --> 00:51:41,489
How is he doing?

666
00:51:41,575 --> 00:51:43,640
Oh.. good.

667
00:51:49,505 --> 00:51:53,154
He.. he's... responding...

668
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:58,083
I don't know, I don't know.

669
00:52:07,181 --> 00:52:08,654
Claire, what's going on?

670
00:52:10,838 --> 00:52:12,638
I crossed the line with him.

671
00:52:14,151 --> 00:52:15,802
An ethical line.

672
00:52:19,175 --> 00:52:23,696
Our relationship is more personal
than it should be.

673
00:52:28,601 --> 00:52:31,915
(sigh) More personal than
it should be.

674
00:52:32,235 --> 00:52:33,627
Yeah.

675
00:53:26,379 --> 00:53:28,043
[Knocking]

676
00:53:37,774 --> 00:53:39,326
Hello, Norman?

677
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:46,375
Norman, it's Dr. Summers, Claire.

678
00:54:00,651 --> 00:54:02,018
Norman.

679
00:54:40,033 --> 00:54:40,874
Hey!

680
00:54:42,418 --> 00:54:43,818
Wait! Don't go!

681
00:54:44,626 --> 00:54:48,508
Hey, stop! Don't go!
Please.

682
00:54:51,947 --> 00:54:53,765
Help me! Please, help!

683
00:55:01,414 --> 00:55:03,189
Help me!

684
00:55:25,851 --> 00:55:27,091
Do you know me?

685
00:55:29,322 --> 00:55:30,308
No.

686
00:55:31,852 --> 00:55:33,987
I can't remember my own name,
and everything.

687
00:55:34,092 --> 00:55:36,443
Why have you been hanging
around the sessions?

688
00:55:36,486 --> 00:55:38,861
I followed one of them
the other day.

689
00:55:38,901 --> 00:55:41,296
The guy who lives here.

690
00:55:41,334 --> 00:55:43,454
He looked familiar.

691
00:55:43,503 --> 00:55:45,821
I thought he could help me
figure things out.

692
00:55:45,854 --> 00:55:48,150
But he wouldn't come near me.

693
00:55:48,175 --> 00:55:50,624
I can't get anything out
since the accident.

694
00:55:50,654 --> 00:55:52,448
You witnessed the accident?

695
00:55:52,472 --> 00:55:53,672
I was in it.

696
00:55:53,696 --> 00:55:54,551
You were on the flight?

697
00:55:54,591 --> 00:55:55,591
Yes.

698
00:55:56,465 --> 00:55:59,449
One moment, I'm sitting there...

699
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:04,675
and there is an explosion,
and I'm here, walking around...

700
00:56:04,699 --> 00:56:06,289
what the hell happened?

701
00:56:10,611 --> 00:56:11,859
It's okay.

702
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:14,397
Have you told anyone else
about this?

703
00:56:14,652 --> 00:56:17,965
No. Who could I talk to?
I don't know any one here.

704
00:56:20,933 --> 00:56:23,607
I'd like you to come with me, please.

705
00:56:23,751 --> 00:56:25,303
Perry, it's Claire.

706
00:56:25,606 --> 00:56:27,543
I need to talk to you,
call me as soon as you get this.

707
00:56:30,016 --> 00:56:31,584
Are you okay?

Oh, why..

712
00:59:07,323 --> 00:59:08,385
Mr. Arkin.

713
00:59:11,004 --> 00:59:13,464
This man was on board, Mr. Arkin.
He remembers an explosion.

714
00:59:16,359 --> 00:59:19,560
For a woman of science, you have
a strong flare for dramatic, doctor.

715
00:59:19,592 --> 00:59:21,841
Passengers are missing, Mr. Arkin.
What do you know about that?

716
00:59:21,864 --> 00:59:22,817
Calm down, please.

717
00:59:22,849 --> 00:59:23,625
Where are they?

00:59:23,657 --> 00:59:24,233
Where is who?

00:59:24,265 --> 00:59:25,193
Where are the other passengers?

720
00:59:25,225 --> 00:59:26,465
Hiding from you, I bet.

721
00:59:26,489 --> 00:59:27,465
This man remembers an explosion...

722
00:59:27,505 --> 00:59:29,954
- You're making a fool of yourself.
- ..what's going on?

723
00:59:29,986 --> 00:59:31,146
I know you.

724
00:59:31,906 --> 00:59:32,747
No.

725
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:34,963
- Yes.
- No.

726
00:59:34,995 --> 00:59:35,858
We've met before.

727
00:59:35,889 --> 00:59:36,843
No, we haven't.

728
00:59:36,883 --> 00:59:38,102
Can you help me remember, please?

729
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:39,997
Help me remember.

730
00:59:40,037 --> 00:59:41,957
We have not met.

731
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:44,374
And if you'd excuse me, I'm busy.

732
00:59:50,206 --> 00:59:52,229
- This man remembers an explosion.
- Hey, why do I know you?

733
00:59:52,598 --> 00:59:53,959
Where do I know you from?

734
00:59:54,478 --> 00:59:57,296
- Back off, sir. Back off.
- Who the hell are you?

735
00:59:57,336 --> 00:59:58,640
- Please back off.
- You back off!

736
00:59:58,672 --> 01:00:00,488
Stop it! Stop it!

737
01:00:01,745 --> 01:00:05,075
You, son of a bitch!
What did you do?

738
01:00:11,777 --> 01:00:14,624
It's okay, folks.
Show's over.

739
01:00:19,395 --> 01:00:21,036
You're not gonna get away with this.

740
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:24,918
This man remembers an explosion.
They--

741
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:35,006
Sir?

742
01:00:37,585 --> 01:00:38,479
Sir?

743
01:01:11,007 --> 01:01:12,838
Shannon, where are the others?

744
01:01:13,622 --> 01:01:18,936
Shannon? Shannon, what's wrong?
Shannon, what's wrong? It's okay.

745
01:01:19,016 --> 01:01:20,352
It's okay, calm down.

746
01:01:27,996 --> 01:01:29,156
Claire.

747
01:01:33,926 --> 01:01:36,830
Oh, God, it's okay.
C'mon.

748
01:01:46,281 --> 01:01:47,840
The engine blew up.

749
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:51,162
It was right outside my window.

750
01:01:53,378 --> 01:01:55,250
Oh, my God, Eric.

751
01:02:23,897 --> 01:02:24,816
Sorry.

752
01:02:30,362 --> 01:02:31,522
How are you feeling?

753
01:02:31,921 --> 01:02:33,074
All right.

754
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:38,004
Where is your family, Shannon?

755
01:02:41,588 --> 01:02:43,459
My parents died when I was six.

756
01:02:44,765 --> 01:02:46,093
I was raised by an aunt.

757
01:02:48,404 --> 01:02:49,772
We were not close.

758
01:02:52,741 --> 01:02:53,974
What happened to them?

759
01:02:59,415 --> 01:03:01,519
They died of a fall...

760
01:03:02,409 --> 01:03:06,697
on a trail.. he was trying
to rescue her, and they both fell.

761
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:12,364
They were probably crushed
to be separated from you.

762
01:03:12,466 --> 01:03:13,819
They left me alone.

763
01:03:13,867 --> 01:03:15,626
They did do that.

764
01:03:18,402 --> 01:03:19,884
I'm sure they knew that.

765
01:03:24,685 --> 01:03:26,901
What would you tell them
that they don't know?

766
01:03:33,004 --> 01:03:34,708
What would you tell them now?

767
01:03:40,126 --> 01:03:43,632
I know that it was an accident.

768
01:03:44,936 --> 01:03:48,993
Something that happened to them,
that they couldn't help.

769
01:03:53,857 --> 01:03:55,210
What else?

770
01:04:02,627 --> 01:04:04,277
I forgive them.

771
01:04:34,993 --> 01:04:38,571
[Dog barking]

772
01:04:49,548 --> 01:04:50,676
Eric?

773
01:04:51,613 --> 01:04:53,293
- What's wrong?
- Shhh.

774
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:22,843
Eric, what is it?

775
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:25,573
That's my dog.

776
01:05:27,643 --> 01:05:28,492
What?

777
01:05:30,294 --> 01:05:32,092
That dog.

778
01:05:33,998 --> 01:05:36,430
He's buried in my mom's backyard.

779
01:05:37,061 --> 01:05:38,918
He died when I was six.

780
01:05:39,846 --> 01:05:40,910
Eric?

781
01:05:41,127 --> 01:05:43,000
I didn't survive the crash.

782
01:05:43,337 --> 01:05:45,272
- Eric.
- I didn't survive.

783
01:05:45,336 --> 01:05:47,511
Eric, look at me. Look at me.

784
01:05:47,544 --> 01:05:50,648
You're fine. You're here with me, now.

785
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:52,123
You're here with me.

786
01:05:52,153 --> 01:05:53,152
I didn't make it.

787
01:05:53,192 --> 01:05:56,065
Yes, you did.
That's a neighbor's dog.

788
01:05:56,130 --> 01:05:58,273
You're okay.
He's gone.

789
01:05:59,971 --> 01:06:02,195
See, he's gone.
He's gone.

790
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:09,492
Wait.

791
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,176
Eric.

792
01:06:30,016 --> 01:06:30,952
Eric!

793
01:06:37,354 --> 01:06:38,226
Eric!

794
01:06:40,434 --> 01:06:41,379
Eric!

795
01:06:43,515 --> 01:06:44,716
Eric, stop!

796
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:53,684
Eric!

797
01:06:57,493 --> 01:06:58,662
Eric!

798
01:07:12,841 --> 01:07:14,050
Eric!

799
01:07:21,019 --> 01:07:22,667
Eric!

800
01:07:42,462 --> 01:07:43,414
Eric!

801
01:07:49,327 --> 01:07:53,600
Stay away from me, Claire.
You stay away.

802
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:57,497
Eric, let's go home, okay?

803
01:07:57,618 --> 01:07:58,603
C'mon, let's go.

804
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:00,898
Get away from me!

805
01:08:01,065 --> 01:08:02,649
Just go!

806
01:08:20,404 --> 01:08:21,589
Shannon?

807
01:08:24,407 --> 01:08:25,615
Shannon?

808
01:08:25,756 --> 01:08:27,553
- Claire?
- Shannon?

809
01:08:27,791 --> 01:08:28,712
Hi, honey.

810
01:08:28,775 --> 01:08:30,446
Have you seen a young woman?

811
01:08:30,526 --> 01:08:33,049
She's my friend Shannon,
she was.. here.

812
01:08:33,073 --> 01:08:34,912
Yeah, she just left.

813
01:08:37,616 --> 01:08:38,818
By herself?

814
01:08:39,546 --> 01:08:41,506
No, with a man and a woman.

815
01:08:42,963 --> 01:08:45,692
Oh, Claire, you're tired,
you should get some rest.

816
01:08:47,347 --> 01:08:49,548
No, no, my patients.. they are..

817
01:08:49,628 --> 01:08:51,444
They'll be fine.

818
01:08:52,156 --> 01:08:54,028
Eric will be fine, too.

819
01:08:55,645 --> 01:08:57,268
I'll get you some tea.

820
01:08:59,117 --> 01:09:00,510
Eric?

821
01:09:03,023 --> 01:09:04,487
Eric.

822
01:09:09,256 --> 01:09:11,312
I never told you his name.

823
01:09:15,209 --> 01:09:18,281
Passengers are missing, all of them,
not just missing sessions...

824
01:09:18,346 --> 01:09:19,618
they are missing.

825
01:09:20,426 --> 01:09:23,378
What if survivors weren't even
accounted for? How does that happen?

826
01:09:24,043 --> 01:09:27,587
I don't know. I'm..
how do you think it happens?

827
01:09:27,636 --> 01:09:30,266
I think the airline is
targetting the passengers.

828
01:09:31,123 --> 01:09:32,916
One by one, they are all disappearing.

829
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:35,765
Maybe, they don't need you anymore.

830
01:09:35,876 --> 01:09:37,317
We got to stop this, Perry.

831
01:09:38,677 --> 01:09:40,310
You're looking for the truth?

832
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:42,662
Yes!

833
01:09:43,038 --> 01:09:47,223
When we lie, we make up
our lies with pieces.. of the truth.

834
01:09:48,295 --> 01:09:49,807
What does that
have to do with this?

835
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:52,295
So, there must be some reason
why you've latched on...

836
01:09:52,327 --> 01:09:55,000
to this elaborate theory
of a cover-up.

837
01:09:55,664 --> 01:09:56,713
What?

838
01:09:56,905 --> 01:09:59,313
Maybe it's gone as far as it can.

839
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:03,355
They got to you, Arkin got to you.

840
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:05,221
No. Claire.

841
01:10:05,763 --> 01:10:06,919
It's not like that.

842
01:10:07,894 --> 01:10:10,656
Don't you come near me.
Don't!

843
01:10:17,914 --> 01:10:21,969
Is that why you brought me in?
To keep tabs on the passengers?

844
01:10:24,723 --> 01:10:27,068
It's not me.
You don't know me.

845
01:11:17,341 --> 01:11:18,310
They're dead.

846
01:11:23,471 --> 01:11:26,040
They are all dead.

847
01:11:33,153 --> 01:11:34,928
That pilot.. he was...

848
01:11:38,098 --> 01:11:39,515
he was tired.

849
01:11:41,707 --> 01:11:44,076
He was in the middle of a divorce.

850
01:11:45,796 --> 01:11:51,460
He wasn't even in the cockpit
when it happened.

851
01:11:51,572 --> 01:11:53,445
Did you know that?

852
01:11:53,629 --> 01:11:55,254
Where was he?

853
01:12:00,303 --> 01:12:02,614
He left it in the hands of the copilot.

854
01:12:03,614 --> 01:12:05,401
He never should've done that.

855
01:12:05,512 --> 01:12:07,440
It wasn't him.

856
01:12:07,878 --> 01:12:11,009
The passengers saw that explosion
outside of the window.

857
01:12:11,528 --> 01:12:13,754
No. It had nothing to do
with the pilot.

858
01:12:13,786 --> 01:12:14,793
No.

859
01:12:14,834 --> 01:12:16,578
He tried his best to land
the plane on the beach.

860
01:12:16,626 --> 01:12:18,578
If anyone made it,
it was because of him.

861
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:19,610
You're wrong.

862
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:21,004
That man is hero.

863
01:12:21,051 --> 01:12:22,964
You are wrong!

864
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:25,820
No.

865
01:12:38,487 --> 01:12:40,857
It.. w..as... me..

866
01:12:41,865 --> 01:12:43,096
What?

867
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:51,858
What did you say?

868
01:14:02,864 --> 01:14:04,081
I'm in your seat. Sorry.

869
01:14:16,257 --> 01:14:27,334
No, no, no..
No! No! No!

870
01:14:30,414 --> 01:14:34,357
[Sobbing]

871
01:15:01,891 --> 01:15:03,037
Good morning.

872
01:15:04,092 --> 01:15:05,757
Good morning.

873
01:15:11,117 --> 01:15:12,718
I found something.

874
01:15:13,950 --> 01:15:15,141
What's that?

875
01:15:15,406 --> 01:15:17,201
A list of passengers.

876
01:15:27,001 --> 01:15:28,466
Why didn't you tell me?

877
01:15:29,675 --> 01:15:32,025
It's not a sort of thing you can be told.

878
01:15:33,689 --> 01:15:35,674
You gotta figure it out for yourself.

879
01:15:37,467 --> 01:15:38,986
When you are ready.

880
01:15:50,693 --> 01:15:52,045
Here you go.

881
01:15:52,436 --> 01:15:53,157
Sorry.

882
01:15:53,421 --> 01:15:55,086
- Oh, thank you.
- Sure.

883
01:15:56,990 --> 01:15:58,263
Coming or going?

884
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:00,366
Going home.

885
01:16:00,662 --> 01:16:02,135
Me, too.

886
01:16:03,479 --> 01:16:04,424
Eric.

887
01:16:04,584 --> 01:16:06,113
Claire Summers.

888
01:16:33,446 --> 01:16:35,573
People come back to help you.

889
01:16:35,902 --> 01:16:39,230
Come to terms, lead the way.

890
01:16:40,303 --> 01:16:42,815
My grandfather came back for me.

891
01:16:42,854 --> 01:16:45,048
I didn't even recognize him.

892
01:16:46,024 --> 01:16:47,376
And my dog.

893
01:16:48,064 --> 01:16:49,313
(sigh)

894
01:16:57,105 --> 01:16:59,275
Who came back for you?

895
01:17:13,597 --> 01:17:15,197
My aunt, Toni.

896
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:21,397
And Mr. Perry.

897
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:37,330
What about the other passengers?

898
01:17:37,419 --> 01:17:39,099
They're like us.

899
01:17:39,218 --> 01:17:41,883
Making their peace with it
before moving on.

900
01:17:43,444 --> 01:17:45,779
Nobody survived the crash.

901
01:17:57,046 --> 01:17:58,453
And everyone else?

902
01:18:01,023 --> 01:18:04,335
They're just here
