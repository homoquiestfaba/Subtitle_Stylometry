1
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:44,100
Hey Pat, what's up?

2
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:45,500
Hey man, where you coming from?

3
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:47,701
The other guy Ted
who comes in on Sundays,

4
00:00:47,767 --> 00:00:49,133
He had a party.

5
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,100
How was it?

6
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:52,067
Um, stupid, ridiculous,

7
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:54,801
too crowded,
I don't know why I went.

8
00:00:54,868 --> 00:00:56,500
Open bar?

9
00:00:57,968 --> 00:01:00,434
Hardly anybody was drinking though.

10
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,968
Did you pick up the slack?

11
00:01:02,033 --> 00:01:03,400
Tried my best.

12
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:05,767
It was a big Hollywood party too,

13
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:07,534
but nobody was drinking.

14
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:10,033
Everybody just nursed their
one drink for two hours.

15
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,868
Why doesn't anyone drink anymore?

16
00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:14,467
What happened to the great
drinkers of the golden age?

17
00:01:14,534 --> 00:01:17,033
These new people all
worried about their careers.

18
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,267
My god, Clark Gable got drunk
and ran a guy over,

19
00:01:19,334 --> 00:01:21,701
They gave him a ticket.

20
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:23,267
What was it like?

21
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:25,567
As soon as I walk in
the first thing I see

22
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:28,868
is a guy walking around with
a cockatiel on his shoulder.

23
00:01:28,934 --> 00:01:32,300
Just a guy walking around
with a bird on himself.

24
00:01:32,367 --> 00:01:33,801
And everyone's acting

25
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:36,334
like this is the most
natural thing in the world.

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,033
Nobody takes any notice of it.

27
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,934
I figure, this guy has gone
through the trouble

28
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:44,968
to bring a live exotic animal
to a party,

29
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:47,534
Maybe he wants a bigger reaction.

30
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:52,067
maybe <i>I</i> could make
this guy's day.

31
00:01:56,334 --> 00:01:59,634
Pardon me, sir...

32
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:03,601
is that a bird on your shoulder?

33
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:08,167
Well, you must be one
fascinating individual.

34
00:02:08,234 --> 00:02:11,601
Your personality is not
at all manufactured.

35
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:14,767
I say, what if we were
to exchange addresses

36
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:17,534
and became pen-pals?

37
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:21,467
That way I could collect your
letters in a bound volume entitled

38
00:02:21,534 --> 00:02:25,601
"My correspondence with the most
interesting person alive"!

39
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:34,934
You can have whatever
kind of pet you want,

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,801
'cause we got dominion
over the beasts of the fields.

41
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:40,000
But here's the thing...

42
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:43,234
Maybe even animals
need some alone time.

43
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,567
How about that?

44
00:02:44,634 --> 00:02:48,300
Maybe the bird didn't want to go
to a party that night.

45
00:02:49,434 --> 00:02:52,334
Maybe he wanted to stay at home
and play with the bell

46
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,567
or look in the mirror, you know?

47
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:57,234
Maybe your pets don't
want to come with you

48
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,934
on all your jackass errands.

49
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:06,267
Yeah, c'mon, Cecil,
let's go to the bank

50
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:09,200
so everyone can see how eccentric I am!

51
00:03:10,434 --> 00:03:12,067
Hey buddy,

52
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:16,000
How much fun do you think the
bird is having at the party?

53
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:18,601
Are wild animals known for their
love of unfamiliar surroundings

54
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:20,901
and large groups of strange people?

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,234
Wow, you said that to him?

56
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,400
No.

57
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:30,133
All I'm trying to do

58
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,667
is get to the bar which is on
the other side of the room.

59
00:03:33,734 --> 00:03:36,133
I have to weave through
all these people to get there.

60
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,467
So, I'm on my way over

61
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:39,133
and this guy asks me for the time,

62
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,400
So I tell him and he says,
"Oh, thank you,

63
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:44,667
I can't wear a wristwatch."

64
00:03:44,734 --> 00:03:49,467
I said, do you have one of those
electromagnetic field things?

65
00:03:49,534 --> 00:03:53,100
"No, no, I just find it's too confining,

66
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:54,767
takes away your freedom."

67
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,868
Yeah, I guess that's true.

68
00:03:57,934 --> 00:04:00,000
You know when a watch
comes in really handy?

69
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:02,300
When you want to know
what time it is.

70
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:06,567
That's when watches
get their chance to shine.

71
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:10,567
The guy's so smug about it

72
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:13,234
like somehow he's better than me
for not wearing a watch.

73
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,834
"I'm too free-spirited
and bohemian to wear a watch.

74
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:18,634
"So I'll just ask you what time it is.

75
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:20,567
You serve the man, right?"

76
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:25,767
You know, if you're that free-spirited,

77
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:27,701
why not go all the way with it?

78
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,367
Why not just refuse to know
what time it is ever?

79
00:04:30,434 --> 00:04:33,767
Just go ahead and ruin people's
weddings and surprise parties.

80
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:36,667
"I'm sorry, man, time is so oppressive.

81
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,834
I took a guess and
wandered on over here."

82
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:43,901
Just throw away your calendars.

83
00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:46,534
"Oh, I'm sorry, was
that funeral yesterday?

84
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:48,934
I'm just too enlightened, I guess."

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,834
The best part of this guy...

86
00:04:50,901 --> 00:04:53,300
He had a beeper, a beeper!

87
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:56,934
How can you feel confined
by the trappings of time

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,801
but still be at the beck and call

89
00:04:58,868 --> 00:05:01,000
of the next <i>nutrageous</i> audition?

90
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:07,500
Let me just check my self-imposed
house arrest shackle,

91
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:09,601
see what my next move is.

92
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:14,200
That's unfair, 'cause a lot
of people with beepers do...

93
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:15,801
deal drugs.

94
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,434
Alright...

95
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,801
trying to get to the bar.

96
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:23,667
I realize as I'm walking over there

97
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:26,667
I'm the only guy here
wearing a suit.

98
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:28,367
That's okay, that's no problem.

99
00:05:28,434 --> 00:05:30,067
But everyone's baffled by this.

100
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:31,601
The guy with
the bird on his shoulder,

101
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:33,567
everyone's fine with,
that makes perfect sense.

102
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,968
They got to understand the suit.

103
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:39,133
This one guy comes up to me,

104
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,901
he's drinking something
out of a jade bottle

105
00:05:40,968 --> 00:05:43,334
that I'm sure is
extracted from some root.

106
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,667
He's wearing a leather jacket
and ripped jeans.

107
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:48,934
He says to me, "What do you sell?"

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,133
I made some little joke or something.

109
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,601
"No, seriously, what do you sell?"

110
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,601
Because I'm wearing a suit?

111
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:59,234
I would never ask this guy,
which Ramone are you?

112
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,500
How long have you been
living off your girlfriend?

113
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:08,634
This one woman
comes up to me and says,

114
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,467
"Hi, do you know
how to swing dance?

115
00:06:11,534 --> 00:06:13,434
"I have a friend who goes
swing dancing all the time.

116
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Her name is Peaches, do you know her?"

117
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:16,801
Alright...

118
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,601
I don't dress this way
'cause I'm a swinger.

119
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:26,801
I'm not part of any kind of movement.

120
00:06:26,868 --> 00:06:28,434
I don't listen to Louie Prima all day

121
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,701
and then jitterbug all night.

122
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:34,167
That's a problem of the sober world...

123
00:06:34,234 --> 00:06:35,434
Judgment.

124
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,734
Not that I don't judge,
oh, I judge up a storm.

125
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:40,133
But here's the difference,

126
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,901
I do my judging silently.

127
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:44,601
I don't judge people to their faces.

128
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:47,367
I form my opinions,
I keep them to myself,

129
00:06:47,434 --> 00:06:49,767
and sometimes, albeit very rarely,

130
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:52,767
I will later be proven wrong
about someone that I have judged.

131
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:54,300
Here's the great thing...

132
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:57,033
they never knew they were
being judged in the first place.

133
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,734
Just because you have
a thought or a feeling

134
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:01,267
doesn't mean it's always
necessary to express it.

135
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:02,767
See, I walk in here wearing a suit,

136
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:04,267
you know what people say?

137
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:06,500
Nothing, they don't care.

138
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:10,968
So...

139
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:13,534
Why do you wear suits all the time?

140
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,067
Why wouldn't I?

141
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:17,000
Why not take advantage of being a man?

142
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:18,934
It's a great experience to buy a suit.

143
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,067
Every man should go
through that at least once.

144
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,534
What'd the people at the party say

145
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:26,534
when you explained that to them?

146
00:07:27,968 --> 00:07:30,968
I didn't really say all <i> that...</i>

147
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:34,067
necessarily, you know, I mostly...

148
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:37,167
I mostly just gave them a look.

149
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:45,100
A look?

150
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:46,067
Yeah.

151
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,434
You know, like utter disdain.

152
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,567
like...

153
00:07:54,234 --> 00:07:55,500
Wow.

154
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:57,067
Yeah, huh?

155
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:59,367
Was there anybody famous
at this Hollywood party?

156
00:07:59,434 --> 00:08:02,100
That idiot from
"Going to Malibu" was there.

157
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:03,334
I met him.

158
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,667
Was he a nice guy?

159
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,567
No, he was a jackass, check it out.

160
00:08:06,634 --> 00:08:10,033
Alright, trying to get to the bar, okay?

161
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,200
I end up halfway over there
talking to this guy Ted,

162
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:15,467
guy who's party it is,
guy I barely know.

163
00:08:15,534 --> 00:08:18,634
and we're talking and the famous guy

164
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:21,033
from "Going to Malibu" walks past us.

165
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,901
then Ted, like he's doing us
both a huge favor,

166
00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:26,400
grabs us both and says,
"Have you two met?"

167
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:29,067
I stick my hand out for
the famous guy to shake it.

168
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,701
And he kind of mumbles something,

169
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:32,367
and the whole time
he's shaking my hand,

170
00:08:32,434 --> 00:08:35,567
he's looking all around the room.

171
00:08:35,634 --> 00:08:37,634
Why can't he make eye contact?

172
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:39,434
Is it because he's famous?

173
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,801
It's all too much for him now.

174
00:08:41,868 --> 00:08:43,634
"I'm sorry, man, I can't.

175
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:45,901
"I can't do regular
human things anymore.

176
00:08:45,968 --> 00:08:48,901
"You know, I'm all
famous and everything.

177
00:08:48,968 --> 00:08:51,067
"It's kind of hard to look at you.

178
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:52,334
"I'm kind of a genius

179
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,601
so your eyeballs are a 'no zone' for me."

180
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,767
So the famous guy
goes on his famous way.

181
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:01,767
And I remark to some of
my fellow party-goers that

182
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,968
that seemed rather impolite.

183
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:05,767
This one guy instantly,

184
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:08,167
"You have to understand him,
He's very shy."

185
00:09:08,234 --> 00:09:09,667
Shy?

186
00:09:09,734 --> 00:09:12,300
Than what the fuck is
He doing in show business?

187
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:17,701
How shy can you be to put
yourself on display for a living?

188
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:19,167
Look at him.

189
00:09:19,234 --> 00:09:21,534
Buddy, let's say that's true,
let's say you're shy.

190
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:26,367
Here's a little tip to help you
get along in the world.

191
00:09:26,434 --> 00:09:29,434
Next time someone
offers you their hand,

192
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,234
Why don't you take
some of that bullshit

193
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,868
that you turn on for the camera...

194
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:40,801
and "act" polite?

195
00:09:40,868 --> 00:09:43,334
Instead of treating someone
who didn't ask to meet you

196
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,334
like they're a bug.

197
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,067
If it's that hard for you,
why don't you run lines with a friend?

198
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:50,534
"Okay, I'll be me..."

199
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:56,601
"and you be the regular guy.

200
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:57,734
"Hi.

201
00:09:57,801 --> 00:10:00,167
This is hard, let's go again."

202
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:05,968
There are genuinely
shy people in the world,

203
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:08,133
let's leave them out of it.

204
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,467
Alright, I'm trying to get to the bar.

205
00:10:11,534 --> 00:10:13,601
Everyone I pass is talking to me

206
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,667
about how much they hate Hollywood.

207
00:10:15,734 --> 00:10:17,667
They're all blabbing on
about how horrible Hollywood is.

208
00:10:17,734 --> 00:10:19,701
They're not saying anything
really specific,

209
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:21,767
they're just repeating things
they heard before,

210
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:23,434
ridiculous general things.

211
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,434
"Oh, I miss the change of seasons..."

212
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,601
"Hollywood makes people different."

213
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:33,033
"There's no culture here."

214
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,000
Okay, don't try to bullshit me

215
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:38,367
that you're on some big culture hunt.

216
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:44,033
the city has museums, it has theater,

217
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,467
it has everything that
every other major city has.

218
00:10:46,534 --> 00:10:48,234
just because you don't
take advantage of it

219
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,434
doesn't mean it ain't there.

220
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,367
number two, the change of
seasons is overrated,

221
00:10:53,434 --> 00:10:55,067
overrated!

222
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:57,133
It only lasts for a couple weeks

223
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,434
then you're into the miserable season.

224
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,567
I grew up with snow,
I love to look at it.

225
00:11:03,634 --> 00:11:06,467
I love to watch it fall
majestically from the heavens.

226
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:09,601
I love to cup it in my hands,
I don't like to shovel it.

227
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:13,400
I don't like risking
a heart attack for weather.

228
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,701
And finally,

229
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:20,467
Hollywood does not make
anybody into something

230
00:11:20,534 --> 00:11:23,634
they didn't already want
to be in the first place.

231
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:25,033
It's just like alcohol.

232
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,601
I don't subscribe to the theory

233
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:29,200
that some people become a
different person when they drink.

234
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:31,033
I think they're the different
person when they're sober.

235
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,467
Then they get a couple drinks in them

236
00:11:32,534 --> 00:11:34,567
and the real asshole comes out.

237
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,300
It's the same thing with Hollywood.

238
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,400
The person you knew in Iowa

239
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:45,434
that was nice and kind
and generous and sweet

240
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,834
was waiting all their lives in Iowa

241
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:50,567
so they could come to Hollywood

242
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:53,968
and be the asshole
they always wanted to be.

243
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:57,701
This one woman, she's on a TV show.

244
00:11:57,767 --> 00:11:59,434
She's on a TV show.

245
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,000
She's sitting their with her
warm half glass of wine.

246
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:05,367
She's saying, "I'd rather live
in a nice town like Portland."

247
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,000
You know what, TV star?

248
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:09,100
You wouldn't be a TV star in Portland.

249
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:11,500
That would get old real fast.

250
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:13,734
ou know what you'd be
if you lived in Portland?

251
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:15,000
An alcoholic.

252
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:21,534
You can do that here
and still be in movies.

253
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,734
You know what?
Philadelphia is a nice town,

254
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:27,434
Why don't you go live there?

255
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,901
I left a spot open for you.

256
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:34,567
Why shouldn't somebody go live
in Philadelphia or Portland?

257
00:12:34,634 --> 00:12:36,534
Hollywood is a pit.

258
00:12:36,601 --> 00:12:41,300
Pat, Hollywood is the greatest
city on the face of the earth.

259
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:44,167
What's so great about Hollywood?

260
00:12:44,234 --> 00:12:46,434
I'll tell you what's so great about it.

261
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,033
The other day I'm in my neighborhood,

262
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,767
I'm walking to
my neighborhood drugstore.

263
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:53,434
What do I see across the street?

264
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,000
I see three people
in "Star Trek" uniforms.

265
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:59,968
Because part of my neighborhood
is Paramount Studios.

266
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:01,901
Now these people
don't think anything of it.

267
00:13:01,968 --> 00:13:03,601
They're on their way
to lunch, whatever.

268
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:05,334
But they're in their work clothes.

269
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,300
And their work clothes
are "Star Trek" clothes.

270
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:10,167
That's great.

271
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:17,167
So no one at the party
shared your philosophy, huh?

272
00:13:17,234 --> 00:13:19,334
I'm a man alone, Pat.

273
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,667
Did Maura go with you?

274
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,934
Um, no, Maura was busy.

275
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,334
You guys have a fight?

276
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,968
Mm-hmm.

277
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:29,834
You know, now I couldn't
even enjoy this crummy party

278
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:32,567
because she wasn't there to talk
with about how crummy it was.

279
00:13:32,634 --> 00:13:34,200
What was the fight about?

280
00:13:34,267 --> 00:13:35,767
Jesus, I don't know.

281
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:37,634
She said, "we don't communicate well",

282
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:40,000
And I said,
"What's that supposed to mean?"

283
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:49,300
She's the one I need
at some stupid party.

284
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:51,934
Somebody I can sit with
on a couch and say,

285
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,567
"Look at that guy."

286
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:55,067
But we had a fight.

287
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:56,400
We have these fights all the time

288
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:57,968
And we're not even going out.

289
00:13:58,033 --> 00:13:59,701
We've been friends for years.

290
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:01,200
We always have these huge arguments

291
00:14:01,267 --> 00:14:03,100
and neither one of us
knows where they come from.

292
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:05,067
Actually... I do.

293
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:07,234
It's because I'm in love with her

294
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,167
and she's not in love with me.

295
00:14:09,234 --> 00:14:10,367
Okay, yeah.

296
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:12,167
When you put it that way,
it makes sense.

297
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:14,534
That rings a bell, yeah.

298
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:19,000
She has a problem with
the way I communicate.

299
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:22,834
The way I communicate
could not be simpler.

300
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:25,534
Here's how I would
communicate with you

301
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:27,934
If I felt you had hurt me in some way,

302
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:32,400
first I register the hurt,
I'm stunned by it,

303
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:34,467
I think about it all day long,

304
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:36,434
and I never mention it to you.

305
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:45,767
I then think about it
every time I see you after that

306
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:48,234
and still never bring it up.

307
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,601
Then finally about, oh, I don't know,

308
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:51,901
four to six months later,

309
00:14:51,968 --> 00:14:53,434
I will explode

310
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,934
at some tiny, barely
objectionable thing you say.

311
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,234
Could not be simpler.

312
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:03,434
Now with Maura,

313
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,434
because we've known each other
for so long, we're so close.

314
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,567
I do something special with Maura

315
00:15:09,634 --> 00:15:11,667
I don't do for anyone else.

316
00:15:11,734 --> 00:15:14,334
When I'm mad at Maura
I will have an argument with her

317
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,067
that takes place only in my head.

318
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:22,534
Then...

319
00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:24,300
when I talk to her,

320
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:28,167
it doesn't go remotely like this
argument that I've slaved over,

321
00:15:28,234 --> 00:15:31,200
that I've given up
my sleep to construct.

322
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:33,534
I'll lead off with
my prepared sentence,

323
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:36,868
and she says something that
is way off the script.

324
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:41,601
Now who has the problem communicating?

325
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,734
She can drink, though.

326
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:53,100
She can drink a lot.

327
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:56,667
Is it any wonder I'm crazy about her?

328
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:01,767
We never fight when we're drinking.

329
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:03,701
We only fight when we're sober.

330
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:05,534
I got this theory,

331
00:16:05,601 --> 00:16:08,234
I think there's two different worlds.

332
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,567
I think there's a drinking world
and there's a sober world.

333
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:14,601
The sober world is not
a pleasant place to be.

334
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:16,934
It's mean and rude and
judgmental, it's awful.

335
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,801
But the drinking world is wonderful.

336
00:16:19,868 --> 00:16:21,567
You don't fight with your friends.

337
00:16:21,634 --> 00:16:23,868
You become happy,
your troubles go away.

338
00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:26,200
Now some people
will say that's wrong.

339
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:28,901
People will say you shouldn't
escape into alcohol.

340
00:16:28,968 --> 00:16:31,701
Those people don't know how to drink.

341
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:34,667
You have to know how to drink

342
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:37,834
in order to appreciate
the drinking world.

343
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:39,601
I'm talking about real drinking here.

344
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,868
I'm talking about knowing
what works best for you.

345
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,033
I'm talking about knowing
what your limit is

346
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,734
and going a little bit past it.

347
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:48,434
I'm talking about knowing

348
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,500
that you have to eat before you drink.

349
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:54,434
If you remember nothing else
I've said tonight,

350
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,334
remember to eat before you drink.

351
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:02,601
Now if you know how to drink,

352
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:05,734
you can escape the sober world,

353
00:17:05,801 --> 00:17:08,067
'cause that's where
the bad things happen.

354
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:11,033
You don't have hangovers
when you're drinking,

355
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,567
you have them when you're sober.

356
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:17,767
You don't have blackouts and
the DT's when you're drinking,

357
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:19,868
you have them when you're sober.

358
00:17:19,934 --> 00:17:21,334
When you're drinking
you're not embarrassed

359
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,834
by anything you do.

360
00:17:22,901 --> 00:17:26,100
You feel shame when you're sober.

361
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:27,801
If you know how to drink

362
00:17:27,868 --> 00:17:30,267
nothing bad will happen
to you while you're drinking.

363
00:17:30,334 --> 00:17:31,834
People who get sick from drinking,

364
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:34,667
They have broken
the drinking world's rules.

365
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:36,767
And they are being punished for it

366
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:39,868
by violently heaving
their way to sobriety.

367
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:43,100
Because ignorance of the law
is no excuse for breaking it.

368
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,167
The guy who gets hammered
on tequila in ten minutes

369
00:17:45,234 --> 00:17:47,100
and then cries for two hours

370
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,133
and then goes and wraps
his car around a pole,

371
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,767
He doesn't belong
in the drinking world.

372
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:54,133
That's why we have A.A.,

373
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,133
which is a wonderful organization.

374
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,133
Because we need to remove these
people from the drinking world.

375
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,267
My one problem with them is

376
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:03,734
they believe it is up to the individual

377
00:18:03,801 --> 00:18:06,500
to decide when to stop drinking.

378
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:08,868
I think they could save
a lot of time and trouble

379
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:10,534
if they would let someone like me,

380
00:18:10,601 --> 00:18:11,901
who knows how to drink,

381
00:18:11,968 --> 00:18:14,000
make that decision for them.

382
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:16,534
Maybe arrange some sort of
tour of the bars of America,

383
00:18:16,601 --> 00:18:18,133
and I can just go in.

384
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,701
Yeah, you should not, no, you also.

385
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,934
You, nice pacing,
and you, you're a mess.

386
00:18:27,868 --> 00:18:29,267
I know what I'm talking about too

387
00:18:29,334 --> 00:18:31,901
because I am a good drunk, I am.

388
00:18:31,968 --> 00:18:34,500
I'm not mean, I'm not a fighter,
I don't weep.

389
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:38,367
I just get smiley and
sentimental and I like to sing.

390
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:44,734
That is a pathetic theory.

391
00:18:44,801 --> 00:18:48,000
Pat, you're telling me
that doesn't make any sense?

392
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:50,634
So that party wasn't
in the drinking world,

393
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:52,234
It was in the sober world?

394
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,534
Yeah.

395
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:55,734
And although you were at that party,

396
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,734
you were in the drinking world?

397
00:18:57,801 --> 00:18:59,167
Yes.

398
00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:01,133
You're an idiot.

399
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,534
Let me explain it to you
so even you can understand it.

400
00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:07,500
Let me tell you a little story.

401
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:09,901
In Philadelphia, where I'm from,

402
00:19:09,968 --> 00:19:13,200
there's a bar that I used to
frequent called <i>Dirty Franks.</i>

403
00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:15,767
The official name of the bar
was just <i>Franks,</i>

404
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:17,133
But once you got in there,

405
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,534
you automatically added
the "dirty" all by yourself.

406
00:19:19,601 --> 00:19:21,734
It was a really cheap
shot-and-a-beer place.

407
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:24,300
And my friends Adam and Rick
and Jewels and I

408
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:26,567
used to go there all the time
'cause we were all always broke.

409
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:28,067
Sometimes we'd go in the afternoon,

410
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,567
what we liked to call
"a matinee performance".

411
00:19:30,634 --> 00:19:34,234
One afternoon the four of us are there

412
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,801
and we're sitting in
a booth sharing a pitcher.

413
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:38,934
Now Adam and Rick and I
are sharing the pitcher.

414
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,267
Jewels is not drinking,
Jewels is sober.

415
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:46,067
The booths at <i>Dirty Franks</I>
had these copper-top tables,

416
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:48,267
that if you spilled
a drop of beer of them,

417
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:51,200
were automatically
soaking wet with beer.

418
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:53,934
the tables were all just
dripping with beer all the time.

419
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,367
So Rick goes up and gets
a bar rag to wipe our table off.

420
00:19:56,434 --> 00:19:59,767
We finish the pitcher,
Jewels did not have a drop.

421
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:02,334
We want to do some shots.

422
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,534
The cheapest shot at
<i>Dirty Franks</i> was 'Old Crow'."

423
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:09,467
Now if you've never had Old Crow,

424
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:11,367
then you've never accidentally

425
00:20:11,434 --> 00:20:13,567
sprayed hair spray in your mouth.

426
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:20,033
There's a reason Old Crow
is the cheapest shot

427
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,701
at a very cheap bar.

428
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:23,100
It ain't good.

429
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,834
So, we get three shots,
three, not four.

430
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:28,767
Jewels is still not drinking.

431
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:31,200
We down the shots, now we got nothing.

432
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:32,934
We got no shots, we got no beer.

433
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,534
We don't have any money.

434
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:37,067
We're just sitting there
at the wet beer-soaked table.

435
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:40,534
Then Rick, who was crazy,

436
00:20:40,601 --> 00:20:42,500
not crazy in the fun way,

437
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:44,567
"What's he gonna do next?"

438
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:46,167
Crazy in the bad way,

439
00:20:46,234 --> 00:20:48,734
"Oh, I hope we don't go to jail."

440
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:53,567
Rick was the type of guy to do this...

441
00:20:53,634 --> 00:20:56,834
He takes the bar rag,
he wipes the table down,

442
00:20:56,901 --> 00:21:00,300
he wrings it into his glass,
then he drinks it.

443
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:05,534
The remaining three of us
are of course horrified at this.

444
00:21:05,601 --> 00:21:08,667
Then Rick, who was also
the type of guy to do this,

445
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,934
points at Adam and me
and says, "Now you do it."

446
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,133
Of course we said, "No way
we're not gonna do that."

447
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,801
But then, somebody,

448
00:21:15,868 --> 00:21:20,000
and I'm not sure who it was, but...

449
00:21:20,067 --> 00:21:23,834
whoever it was, I hate this person,

450
00:21:23,901 --> 00:21:27,601
said, "I'll do it if you'll do it."

451
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:30,033
Now it might have been Adam.

452
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,000
Adam was fascinating by Rick

453
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:33,801
and could pretty much
be talked into anything,

454
00:21:33,868 --> 00:21:35,434
just needed a little push.

455
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,300
But, it might have been me

456
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:39,534
because I probably
wanted to see Adam do it.

457
00:21:39,601 --> 00:21:41,901
And I wasn't thinking ahead.

458
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,300
Alright...

459
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:46,868
Adam takes the rag,
makes a swipe at the bar,

460
00:21:46,934 --> 00:21:51,834
he wrings the rag into
his glass and he drinks it.

461
00:21:51,901 --> 00:21:53,968
"Oh, goddamn!

462
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:56,701
It's horrible!" the whole bit.

463
00:21:56,767 --> 00:21:59,767
Now it's my turn.

464
00:21:59,834 --> 00:22:03,367
Now the table is completely dry.

465
00:22:03,434 --> 00:22:07,267
Probably for the first time
in the history of <i>Dirty Franks.</i>

466
00:22:07,334 --> 00:22:13,300
I take the rag and I make
a token swipe of the table.

467
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:16,100
I wring the rag into my glass.

468
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:19,000
The liquid is gray.

469
00:22:26,801 --> 00:22:29,200
I bring it up to my face.

470
00:22:29,267 --> 00:22:33,334
And for some reason
I smell it before I drink it.

471
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,601
This is an exceedingly bad idea

472
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:43,200
because my gag reflex is on
a hair trigger to begin with.

473
00:22:43,267 --> 00:22:45,968
I almost lose it right there,

474
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:47,767
But I don't.

475
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:50,934
But I wish I had because then
I would have been excused.

476
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,534
But now because of the holy bond

477
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:54,367
of "I'll do it if you'll do it",

478
00:22:54,434 --> 00:22:56,100
now I have to drink it

479
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,067
and I know exactly
how bad it's going to be.

480
00:22:59,901 --> 00:23:04,300
So I steel myself, and I drink it.

481
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:07,434
And it is horrible.

482
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,267
It is the worst thing I've ever tasted.

483
00:23:10,334 --> 00:23:13,400
It's even worse than Old Crow.

484
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:17,467
So we sit there in silence
for a few minutes.

485
00:23:17,534 --> 00:23:20,400
Jewels is just shaking her head.

486
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:22,234
Then we leave, okay.

487
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,500
Now Adam and I lived across
the street from each other.

488
00:23:25,567 --> 00:23:27,133
We saw each other just about every day.

489
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,834
For three weeks to a month
after that day

490
00:23:29,901 --> 00:23:32,267
we had the exact same conversation

491
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:34,033
whenever we greeted each other.

492
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,267
"Hey, man, how's it going?"

493
00:23:35,334 --> 00:23:38,667
"Do you still feel awful?"

494
00:23:43,701 --> 00:23:45,400
"Yeah."

495
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:47,500
Okay...

496
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:50,534
Here's what I gathered
from that incident.

497
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:53,200
First, I did not yet know how to drink.

498
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:55,701
Because if I had,
that wouldn't have happened.

499
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,901
Since then, through
subsequent trial and error,

500
00:23:57,968 --> 00:24:00,067
I found out what works for me.

501
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:01,834
No more hard liquor,
I just stick to beer.

502
00:24:01,901 --> 00:24:03,467
That's it, so far so good.

503
00:24:03,534 --> 00:24:06,701
I haven't drunk any
bar rag squeezing since.

504
00:24:07,734 --> 00:24:10,567
From Rick I learned
there were two separate worlds.

505
00:24:10,634 --> 00:24:12,534
Because Rick was crazy,

506
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:15,634
he had enough shit going on in his
head to entertain him all day long.

507
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:17,601
He didn't need alcohol to enhance it.

508
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:21,234
Rick belonged in a world
where there was no drinking.

509
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,100
He belonged in a sober world

510
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:25,701
where he was both happy and harmless.

511
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:28,400
I learned that Adam was the idiot

512
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,868
who would drink
the squeezings of a bar rag.

513
00:24:31,934 --> 00:24:34,334
Now Jewels taught me

514
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,968
that the sober world
is not to be trusted.

515
00:24:38,033 --> 00:24:40,767
Because she was sober
and we were drunk.

516
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:42,667
She had sober reasoning.

517
00:24:42,734 --> 00:24:44,234
She could've put a stop
to the whole thing.

518
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,767
She could've said
something as simple as,

519
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:49,167
"Hey, don't drink from that rag,
there might be poison in it!"

520
00:24:49,234 --> 00:24:52,801
We would had said, "Yeah,
you're right, thanks."

521
00:24:52,868 --> 00:24:55,234
But no, no, she didn't.

522
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,300
She just sat back
and watched the horror.

523
00:24:58,367 --> 00:25:00,000
Just like America

524
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:02,901
waiting so long to
get into World War II.

525
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:08,701
How many innocent lives
could've been saved

526
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:11,300
if only we'd acted sooner?

527
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:14,767
So the sober world
is not to be trusted.

528
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:18,200
Hey, last call.

529
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,534
I'm good, Pat, thanks.

530
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:40,901
When you're a grown-up...

531
00:25:40,968 --> 00:25:44,367
you get to enjoy beer.

532
00:25:44,434 --> 00:25:46,934
Now you have it,

533
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,567
when you're in high school
and college, you have it.

534
00:25:49,634 --> 00:25:54,234
But when you're an adult,
you really get to enjoy it.

535
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:59,100
Let's say you work all day,
you're on your way home,

536
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:02,000
you're really tired.

537
00:26:02,067 --> 00:26:04,334
It's that really good kind of tired,

538
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,934
where you know
that you're on your way home.

539
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,167
Soon you're gonna be at your home.

540
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,000
You're gonna be by yourself
for a little bit.

541
00:26:12,067 --> 00:26:15,400
You get home, you go to your fridge,

542
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:20,467
You get yourself a bottle of beer.

543
00:26:20,534 --> 00:26:23,100
It's ice cold.

544
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:24,834
You open it up

545
00:26:24,901 --> 00:26:27,400
and it makes that great sound,
that hissing sound.

546
00:26:27,467 --> 00:26:31,534
Even the cap hitting the counter
makes a great sound.

547
00:26:31,601 --> 00:26:35,133
Go to your living room,
sit down on the couch,

548
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,000
bring that bottle up to your lips.

549
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:40,334
You can smell that smell,
that beer smell.

550
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,567
It reminds you of what beer smelled
like to you when you were a little kid.

551
00:26:43,634 --> 00:26:45,434
You didn't like the taste of beer.

552
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,234
But now it's a fond memory.

553
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,801
Remembering when you were a little kid

554
00:26:48,868 --> 00:26:50,667
and things were really simple,

555
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,434
and you didn't like the taste of beer.

556
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,167
but now you're a grown-up,
you take a sip.

557
00:26:57,234 --> 00:27:00,200
It really tastes like beer.

558
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:02,067
You've had plenty of beers
in your life.

559
00:27:02,133 --> 00:27:05,901
But this one reminds you
of what beer tastes like.

560
00:27:05,968 --> 00:27:09,500
Kind of sharp on your tongue,
a little bitter.

561
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:11,801
It's so cold.

562
00:27:11,868 --> 00:27:17,267
There's nothing else like it,
a nice cold beer.

563
00:27:39,067 --> 00:27:41,267
You're allowed to have it.

564
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:51,334
Just make sure you eat first.

565
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,467
Craig Anton!
