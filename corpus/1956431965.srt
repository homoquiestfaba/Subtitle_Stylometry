1
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:18,986
Hi.

2
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,588
Hi, how you doing?

3
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,090
All right.

4
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:26,127
Uh, you do tattoos, huh?

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,329
This is the place, yeah.

6
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,763
Wanna get tattooed?

7
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:32,266
Yeah, I was thinking
about getting a tattoo.

8
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,169
You know what you want to get?

9
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:37,471
Uh, no.

10
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:43,177
But I... I'm thinking
about it right now.

11
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:44,612
You wanna get like a tribal,

12
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:47,681
floral, Celtic designs, animal...

13
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,650
What's...
What's the one

14
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:52,786
with like the interlacing stuff?

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,054
The Celtic designs.

16
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:56,757
Yeah? That seems good.

17
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,193
Here, let me give you a book
on that you can look at it.

18
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:00,261
Oh, great.

19
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,071
Do you have any tattoos now?

20
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:13,707
No, no. This is it,
number one.

21
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:14,675
This your first one, huh?

22
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:15,843
Yeah.

23
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:18,212
And you really haven't
thought about what you want?

24
00:01:18,246 --> 00:01:20,114
Oh, I've thought about it.

25
00:01:22,183 --> 00:01:24,051
But you don't know
what you want to get.

26
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,819
How about the cow.

27
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:26,487
Cow?

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,256
It's nice.

29
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:31,692
Where's it hurt the least?
Do you know?

30
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,694
The first one hurts the most.

31
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:35,429
The first one's
gonna hurt the most.

32
00:01:35,463 --> 00:01:36,464
Really?

33
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:37,531
Yeah, it hurts
anyplace you get it.

34
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:40,067
Even if... I mean,
ok, uh... mmm.

35
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,470
I should tell you,
I'm a little bit drunk.

36
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:44,238
Oh, yeah, you don't
want to get it if you're drunk.

37
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:46,307
No?
But won't that dull the pain?

38
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,276
No, that'd... no,
you can't sit still when you...

39
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:49,677
You may
throw up all over me.

40
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,944
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

41
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:54,815
Hell yeah,
I'm tellin' ya, it happens,

42
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,451
so, you know, and you're gonna
move around way too much,

43
00:01:57,485 --> 00:02:00,754
and it's gonna be difficult
for me to tattoo you.

44
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,990
Is that... is it legal?
I mean, can you...

45
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:05,593
Yeah, you can tattoo somebody
if they're... but I won't.

46
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,662
Because
it's just too difficult.

47
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:10,631
Too many headaches.

48
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:11,732
It's gonna be worse than

49
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,734
a headache
you have tomorrow morning

50
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:15,469
for me to tattoo you now
if you're drunk.

51
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:20,741
Tattoo.

52
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,243
Where's all your friends today?

53
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:25,379
Uh... uh, they're...

54
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,751
Hmm, I don't know.

55
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,420
Well, your friends
won't let you get tattooed

56
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:33,454
if you're out drunk.

57
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,522
No.

58
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:38,025
You always get the wrong thing.

59
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:39,293
It's there for the rest of your life.

60
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:46,900
Hi.

61
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:47,601
Hi.

62
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:48,569
Hey, what's goin' on?

63
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:49,537
Not much, how are you?

64
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,471
Fine.

65
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,805
Are you really busy?

66
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,375
Hold on one second,
let me just send this thing.

67
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,079
Now I'm done.

68
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:02,450
Uh, I don't know.
Well, did you hear I got fired?

69
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:03,417
What? Really?

70
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:04,151
Yeah.

71
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:04,952
Like, fired?

72
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,120
Yeah, fired.

73
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:08,055
Wow. What did you do?

74
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:11,692
That's crazy.

75
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:12,893
Yeah, it's... it's crazy.

76
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,262
It was kind of
embarrassing, actually.

77
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:15,529
I went in
to ask for a raise...

78
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:16,997
Uh-huh.

79
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,732
And you got fired
for asking for a raise?

80
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:20,668
Yeah.

81
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,870
Wow. Did you...
What'd you just... huh.

82
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,772
How? I still don't...
I don't get it.

83
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,908
Yeah, no, no, I know.
I went in there and I was like,

84
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,644
asking for this raise,
and the guy was like,

85
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:33,046
"Marnie, do you
like working here?"

86
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,449
And I was like,
"uh, y-yes."

87
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:36,250
Wow.

88
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:37,150
You know, I was too...

89
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,218
Yeah, it's too late
at that point.

90
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:39,987
It's too late, yeah.

91
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,221
So, I'm fired.

92
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:42,956
So what,
what are you doing now?

93
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,159
Uh, I am just
wandering the earth, you know?

94
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:49,096
And uh, I guess
I'm looking for a job.

95
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,631
I mean, you guys
aren't hiring are you?

96
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:51,899
No.

97
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,334
We're looking for
programmers and stuff, but...

98
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,402
Yeah, I can't do that.

99
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:55,269
Yeah, you don't
wanna work here.

100
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:56,437
No?

101
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,871
No. You don't wanna
work with me, either.

102
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,507
Really? Why?

103
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,776
Uh, I don't know, I can be
over-demanding, I think.

104
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,844
Yeah.

105
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:06,113
Marnie!

106
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:07,915
Hey, Marnie.

107
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:08,582
Hi.

108
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:09,249
Hey!

109
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:09,917
What's up?

110
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,984
Gimme a hug.

111
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:12,019
Ah!

112
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,186
Hi.

113
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:15,323
What are ya doin'?

114
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:16,957
I don't know,
just, you know, walkin'.

115
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,326
You should come with to dinner with us.

116
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:19,226
We're on our way
to dinner.

117
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,093
What?

118
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,128
Yeah, come on.

119
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,730
What do you have to do?
What's in the bag?

120
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,031
Not too much.
No, just groceries.

121
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,198
Ok, I'll come.

122
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:28,268
Day in, day out, 10 hours
in front of the monitor,

123
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:30,270
fixing some crap
that some idiot broke.

124
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,140
That sounds good.

125
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:34,675
No, it's
boring as hell, man.

126
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,411
I wish I was you.
I wish I had your lifestyle.

127
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:39,212
Why? What do you mean?

128
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,248
I don't know, you're just
bopping along, and, you know,

129
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,783
friends pick you up
and we're going to dinner.

130
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,485
It just seems
spontaneous, more...

131
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,487
Yeah, well, c'mon,
you're going to dinner, too.

132
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,088
I know, but this is...

133
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,491
For us, this is
just what we're doing tonight.

134
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,225
You know, we got
this plan made in advance,

135
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,627
it's not
spontaneous at all.

136
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:55,062
This is
a commitment that we have.

137
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,229
It's excitement-packed.

138
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:58,366
Who are these people?
I mean, what...

139
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,868
Well, could be exciting,
I suppose, I don't know.

140
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:06,440
They're Travis' girlfriend's
engineering student friends.

141
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:07,541
Oh, great!

142
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:08,909
Yeah, see?

143
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,243
Fantastic.

144
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:12,245
Travis' girlfriend's
engineering student friends?

145
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,548
I don't know, it doesn't sound
that exciting to me.

146
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:16,550
Well, you know,
you just have to try.

147
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:20,153
Yeah, come on,
it'll be like...

148
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:21,722
Don't be so anti-social.

149
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:24,592
It'll be
a spontaneous adventure.

150
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,726
We'll get some drinks...

151
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,694
Like my life.

152
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:28,396
And see
if it gets interesting.

153
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:30,197
You can break it down
engineering-style and stuff.

154
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,734
Hi.

155
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:34,602
Hi.

156
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:35,669
You guys ready?

157
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:37,405
Lori and Travis
actually aren't here yet.

158
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:38,639
So you guys maybe wanna come in?

159
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,174
Sorry we're kinda disorganized.

160
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:41,842
Hi, I'm Wyatt.

161
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:42,976
Hey. Dave.

162
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,111
Hi, I'm Marnie.

163
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:46,079
Wyatt. Nice to meet you.

164
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:49,082
Hey, have a seat.

165
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,518
This is Laurie on the phone.

166
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:54,688
She... she says they want to
meet us at the restaurant now.

167
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:55,989
We don't know where we're going yet.

168
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,357
What restaurant?

169
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,793
Uh, yeah,
let me find out. Hold on.

170
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:01,328
Sorry,
we're really disorganized.

171
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,597
It's ok.

172
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:05,165
Oh, so have
you guys all met?

173
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:05,966
We met at the...

174
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,200
Yeah, we saw her
at the door.

175
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:08,669
I just kind of
butted my way in.

176
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,470
It's Marnie, right?

177
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,171
Yeah.

178
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,973
I'm Dave. Yeah, we just
picked up Marnie along the way.

179
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,142
She was walking
outside of our apartment.

180
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,510
Real... oh, ok.

181
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:17,945
How do you guys
know each other?

182
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,647
Uh, we went
to school together.

183
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,350
Think I'm gonna check on
Laurie, see what's going on.

184
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,152
I don't know, I mean what...

185
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,220
So, you guys went
to school together...

186
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,556
Do you have Laurie?

187
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,591
Yeah, here, here, wait.
Let me talk to Rachel, ok?

188
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:32,259
I feel out of place.

189
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,428
In my...
In my own friend's place.

190
00:06:34,462 --> 00:06:36,296
Well, I don't live here, actually.

191
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,631
Let me go help Rachel.

192
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:39,833
Is Travis being difficult? Yeah?

193
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,670
Animal zodiac.
What is your year?

194
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:45,405
Uh, monkey.

195
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,075
So, sometimes you can be
a little ill-tempered.

196
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,277
Really? Me?

197
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,612
Yeah.

198
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,380
And you'll have an opinion about it.

199
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:56,183
Pot calling the kettle black.

200
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:57,885
It's rougher. It's rougher.

201
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,690
I'm the year of the rat.

202
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:05,626
The rat! Oh!
Oh, Marnie, I'm so sorry!

203
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,127
No, it's ok.
Look, it's all right.

204
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,729
Oh, Jesus, I'm really...

205
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,330
No, don't worry.
It's totally, totally fine.

206
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,299
Oh, I'm... and I got it
all over your shirt.

207
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:13,667
Don't worry about it.

208
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:14,935
Listen, I'm just out of control.

209
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:15,903
I don't know what happened.

210
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,304
It's fine.
Look, you fixed it.

211
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,139
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

212
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,774
You all right?

213
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,042
Yeah.

214
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,777
Can you give me a ride
to the dentist tomorrow?

215
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:24,978
Oh, yeah, sure.
What time?

216
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:26,213
1:00?

217
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:27,581
Wait, no, no,
I can't do that.

218
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:29,249
I'm supposed to have
lunch with Alex tomorrow.

219
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,651
Oh, the old pep talk?

220
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:33,220
Yeah, yeah, try and cheer
him up a little bit, you know.

221
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:37,157
That's cool.
I'll find some other way.

222
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,726
Is something
wrong with Alex?

223
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,327
No, there's nothing wrong
with him, exactly.

224
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,829
He's just going through
kind of a hard time.

225
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:44,131
Yeah, him and Nina
broke up.

226
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,465
Really? When?

227
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,067
It's like a week ago
or something.

228
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,136
I just saw him yesterday
and he didn't say anything.

229
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,404
Probably thought that
you already knew about it.

230
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:52,973
I'm gonna go
use the bathroom.

231
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,443
Dude, let's
just rent a movie.

232
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:01,314
Hi.

233
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:02,382
Hey.

234
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,184
You ok?

235
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:08,889
Yeah, I'm ok. I'm...

236
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,159
But...

237
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,695
I don't know, I'm...

238
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm in love
with Alex, and I...

239
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,969
I mean, I'm not
in love with him, but I'm...

240
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,137
But I have some
problem with him.

241
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,906
You have some...
You like Alex.

242
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,007
Yeah.

243
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,275
Well, that's cool.

244
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,611
Well, no, no, it's not.
It's not. I don't know.

245
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,713
So... where do
you guys stand?

246
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,715
I mean, how is it bad?

247
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,784
Do you wanna go
stand over there for a minute?

248
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,351
Uh-huh, lets go.

249
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,093
So, I don't know,
things stand that he's been

250
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,862
fucking going out with
Nina forever of course, and...

251
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:53,767
And they're... I did try to...
Like this one time, I was drunk

252
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:57,705
and I tried to basically tell
him he should be with me.

253
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:58,972
It was bad, you know?

254
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:00,240
Well, he was
going out with Nina.

255
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,442
I know, of course,
yeah, but it was just...

256
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,945
I could tell, you know?
It was just bad.

257
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:07,080
You know, he's not
going out with Nina anymore.

258
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:07,948
I know.

259
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,049
Things
will be different.

260
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,251
No! But don't...
Don't tell me that, you know?

261
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,021
The last thing I need
to hear is... I can't...

262
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:17,658
It's ok. You never know
what's gonna happen.

263
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:19,059
But I do.
But it's already...

264
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,761
You know, it's already ruined.
It's just, I...

265
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:25,098
Listen, me and Dave, we...
We didn't start off like stable

266
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:27,968
and I didn't know what was going
to happen, and I took a chance.

267
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,236
Really?

268
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:32,806
And it turned out
pretty good, you know, but...

269
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,241
I know.
I mean, it's just...

270
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,278
It's not... it's not
that it's the only thing I...

271
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,649
I mean, I don't think about it
so much any more at all,

272
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,817
and now I find out about this.

273
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:46,553
You never know what's
gonna happen, you really don't.

274
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,289
You really,
really don't. I mean...

275
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,759
You and Dave are so awesome,
you know? I mean...

276
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:52,926
Thank you.

277
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,094
That's what it's all about.

278
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,996
Hey, what are you
ladies up to over here?

279
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,364
There he is.
I was just telling Rachel

280
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:59,032
how great you guys are.

281
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:02,102
Aww...

282
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:05,639
And also, I was telling
Rachel that I like Alex.

283
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:08,241
Oh, you mean
you like Alex?

284
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,609
Yeah.

285
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:11,945
Ah, that's great.
That's fantastic.

286
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,647
No, no,
it's not, you know?

287
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:15,082
No, it is.
No, I mean, it's...

288
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,549
You know, it's obvious.
It all sort of...

289
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,851
It's obvious?

290
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:19,586
No, it's not obvious.
Like I didn't already know,

291
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,889
but I mean, it sorta makes
sense, you know what I mean?

292
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:24,524
I mean, you know,
you guys make a great couple.

293
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,393
No. No. No, it's not...

294
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,627
No, come on!
It's a great...

295
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:29,196
It's not a terrible thing.

296
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:32,132
Ooh, this is the
best night of the summer, man.

297
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:35,268
This is fucking fantastic.
I can't believe, you know...

298
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,805
I don't know, just things is...
This shit is real, man.

299
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,873
We got Marnie here,
we got beer,

300
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:42,676
we got food.
You know, life is good.

301
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,311
You are drunk.

302
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,346
You are drunk.

303
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,948
That's true.

304
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,382
Rachel is drunk.

305
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,384
I'm not wasted.

306
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:53,687
You drove here. You're
not wasted. You're responsible.

307
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:54,988
Yeah, you're drunk.

308
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:55,956
That's true.

309
00:10:57,357 --> 00:11:01,194
Oh, Marnie,
how are you? You look sad.

310
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:04,765
Well... yeah.

311
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:07,067
I mean, I don't know, it's not
the best night of my summer.

312
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,535
Ah, well, it should be.

313
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:11,271
You just... malnutrition.
You need some food in you.

314
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:13,006
I have malnutrition?

315
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,743
Yeah... no, look, I've got
Anthony's hummus here.

316
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:17,377
I'm gonna hook you up.

317
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,946
I don't need
hummus, Dave. I mean...

318
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,214
Yeah, hummus really doesn't
solve that many problems, Dave.

319
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:23,516
You underestimate
the value of a good meal.

320
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,651
The power of hummus?

321
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,453
Dave, I don't need hummus.

322
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,021
It's attraction, Dave.

323
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:28,889
Boo!

324
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,023
Fuck!

325
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:31,324
What's goin' on, guys?

326
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,125
Susan!

327
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:32,893
Susan!

328
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:33,894
Hey! What's up, man?

329
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,028
You scared
the shit out of me.

330
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:36,163
Sorry about that.

331
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,798
You guys going
to be up for a little bit?

332
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:38,866
Yeah, we're all drinking.

333
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:39,632
Can I come on in?

334
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:40,467
Yeah, come on in.

335
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,401
Awesome.

336
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:47,340
Oh, come on, you can't get in
this door because it's broken.

337
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,910
If you want, you can
come in the window over here

338
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:51,912
or otherwise, we...
No, I'll meet you...

339
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,380
You want me
to meet you out in front?

340
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,015
All right,
I'll see you there in a jiff.

341
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,316
That was crazy.

342
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:57,284
I know.

343
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:58,385
Are you expecting Susan?

344
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:01,388
No, and she really...
Just really scared me.

345
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,090
Me too.

346
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,426
Maybe she heard
there was...

347
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,629
Hummus?

348
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,264
It's a really
exciting thing, and people...

349
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:12,732
It's the best night
of the summer.

350
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:15,969
It's exotic, and people
hear about it and come by.

351
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,675
I gotta go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

352
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,614
What about that Peruvian guy,
the soccer player?

353
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:30,250
Mr. Don Juan wasn't
exactly the right fit,

354
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,651
if you know what I mean.

355
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,720
I don't know
if I know what you mean.

356
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,955
Hey, Marnie,
what's going on?

357
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,089
Hey, Susan.
How are you?

358
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:38,926
Not a whole heck
of a lot.

359
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,327
I'm on my way to the bathroom.

360
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,863
All right, don't let me get...
Let me get in your way.

361
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,164
So, what you guys
been doing tonight?

362
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,833
You know, a little of this,
a little of that,

363
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,067
a little drink,
a little of not.

364
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,054
Does he need to be
like consoled, I mean...

365
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:09,556
It seems like he's been pretty
upset for a pretty long time.

366
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,292
I don't think he needs to be
consoled or anything like that.

367
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,394
I mean, this is what I think.

368
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:17,097
Ok, I think we need
to find him a new girl.

369
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,699
Forget about Nina, we need
to set him up with a new girl.

370
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:20,633
That's a great idea!

371
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:21,835
Yeah!

372
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:23,403
I know exactly who
you could set him up with.

373
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:25,138
Who? Do I know her?

374
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:26,306
Smart, and you know her...

375
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,074
Awesome...

376
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:27,908
He knows her...

377
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,309
Even better. Yeah?

378
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,578
Ah, oh, I mean...

379
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,681
I'm just speaking in...

380
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:36,950
Uh, I'm not gonna say...

381
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:37,817
Hey, Marnie.

382
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:39,486
Hey. What... I don't...

383
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,188
What's goin' on, guys?

384
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:44,024
I don't... I don't know.
I have no idea what...

385
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,593
I don't know what
I'm saying anything exactly.

386
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,428
I think
I know what's going on.

387
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:52,332
Alex told me this story
about a year ago,

388
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:53,867
and it seems like...

389
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:55,502
Well, ok, I mean, maybe,

390
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:56,970
but I mean,
like there's nothing...

391
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,738
Like, that's no...
There's no story.

392
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,041
Look, Marnie, if you want
to talk, I'm here, ok?

393
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,010
Thanks, but I mean, really,
there's nothing to talk about.

394
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,211
You sure?

395
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:05,879
Seriously.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, seriously.

396
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:08,982
I am not afraid of getting hurt.

397
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,351
That's bullshit.
I mean, if you weren't afraid,

398
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,186
you'd be doing
something about this situation.

399
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,788
Well, look. I did, you know?
I've already done that.

400
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:16,789
You did?

401
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,491
I got hurt, and...

402
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,360
I mean, I didn't like it,
that's true...

403
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:23,530
Well, I mean I guess
I understand about being hurt.

404
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,798
Like I know you don't want
to be vulnerable again,

405
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:28,068
but you're never gonna get
anywhere if you don't.

406
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:31,138
You know, you got to put
yourself out on the line.

407
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:33,373
Tell him how you feel.

408
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,976
He knows how I feel.

409
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:38,078
Ok, Alex might...

410
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,747
You may think
Alex knows how you feel,

411
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,416
but, I mean,
you've kinda gotta...

412
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,219
You've gotta be repetitive.
You've gotta keep telling him.

413
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:47,654
You gotta...
You gotta show him.

414
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,057
It's all about action.
I mean...

415
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,359
He tells me how he feels
about you all the time.

416
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,262
When I bring up your name,
or he brings up your name,

417
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:58,065
he's like, "Marnie's so funny.
Marnie's so cool.

418
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,933
"You know, I love
hanging out with her,

419
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:02,769
"she's a great gal."
I mean, come on.

420
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,271
I think you should ask him out.

421
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,573
I wouldn't be saying this,
you know, just to say it.

422
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:10,410
Oh, I know. I mean,
that's like... go straight.

423
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:11,611
Ok.

424
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,649
If I put it in
gear first, right?

425
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:18,885
I mean, I'm glad...
You know, I'm glad it's...

426
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,687
I'm glad
he likes me so much...

427
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,854
Yeah.

428
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:23,356
But I just...

429
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,058
I mean,
if he does, why...

430
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:28,996
I mean, I just feel like
if he... if he feels that way,

431
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,863
then he'll do something
about it, and if I...

432
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,265
He's not like that.
You know that.

433
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:33,833
I mean, he doesn't...

434
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,136
He's a tad bit
socially inept, you know?

435
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,171
Yeah.

436
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,745
Here, it's...
It's the next right up here.

437
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,946
Ok.

438
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:53,353
Take care.

439
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:54,787
Thanks a lot
for the ride, Susan.

440
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:55,455
No problem.

441
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:56,756
Ok, bye.

442
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:25,418
Morning, inteletec.

443
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:29,122
Ok, um...
Uh, one moment.

444
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:33,526
Hi.

445
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,362
Hi, I'm from
ashby staffing.

446
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,297
Oh, sure.
You're... Margaret.

447
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,165
Marnie.

448
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:39,866
Marnie. Ok.

449
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,935
My name is Mitchell,
I'm also from ashby.

450
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:46,606
So, uh, yeah,
so I guess all there is...

451
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,874
You can
just go through this...

452
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:49,942
Sorry.

453
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:51,878
Good morning, inteletec.

454
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:58,618
Ok.
Uh, one moment, please.

455
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,690
Um... sorry.

456
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,158
No, it's ok.

457
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,294
If... if...
Go through the doors

458
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,461
and go around to the right

459
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,563
and see a desk
with a nameplate on it

460
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:12,199
that says Kimberly kafferky.

461
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:13,066
Ok.

462
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,267
If you just go sit in there,

463
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:15,568
Kimberly's not even in yet,

464
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:18,071
but you'll be working
with her or with me.

465
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:20,573
Ok, so you just want me
to go sit in Kimberly...

466
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:21,808
Kafferky's.

467
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:24,077
...office. And can I
help you with anything, or...?

468
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:26,713
Uh, no, no, no.
I think...

469
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,581
I think just...
Just sit in there

470
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:30,550
and... and you could
sit out here with me, but...

471
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,155
Good morning,
inteletec.

472
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:38,291
Ok. All right, I'm sorry.
Let me... let me try again.

473
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,533
Hey. Hi. Sorry.

474
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:47,534
Hi.

475
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,136
So, I'm Mitchell.

476
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:50,203
Marnie.

477
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:51,971
Right, got it.

478
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,440
And so like I said,

479
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,675
I think Kimberly's gonna
come in in a minute.

480
00:17:55,708 --> 00:18:00,647
Basically she's gonna give you
a big stack of clients' names

481
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,250
and you pretty much
just will fire up the computer

482
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:05,352
and you just
enter that into excel.

483
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:06,553
Do you know excel
pretty well?

484
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,054
Uh, hmm,
I'm familiar with it.

485
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,622
I mean, is it like a...

486
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:10,890
It's nothing complicated.

487
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,292
It's really...
It's pretty self-explanatory.

488
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:13,660
I'm sure I can handle it.

489
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,895
I'm sure you'll be fine.

490
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,398
So is this... how...
How long have you been temping?

491
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,899
Oh, it's my first day.

492
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,569
Ok, well,
welcome to full time...

493
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,737
What do you...
What do you do like in your...

494
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,174
When you're...
What's your deal?

495
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:31,444
What's my deal?
Uh, I don't know.

496
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:33,045
You know, I'm sorry, that's
such a terrible question.

497
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,448
No, no, it's fine.
I'm just, um...

498
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:42,155
No, no, no, no, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'll see you later.

499
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:45,592
Well, wait, I didn't mean
to be unfriendly. I'm sorry.

500
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,826
I feel like I'm...

501
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,195
No, not at all.
No, you're totally...

502
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:50,763
You totally
did everything correctly.

503
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,299
You have
nothing to worry about.

504
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:55,468
Ok, well, all right.

505
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:56,669
I will see you later.

506
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:57,604
Ok, bye.

507
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,871
Bye.

508
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:14,621
<i>Hi, this is Marnie.</i>

509
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,055
<i>I can't take
your call right now,</i>

510
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,291
<i>but leave me a message
and I'll call you back. Thanks.</i>

511
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:22,128
Um, hi, Marnie, this is Alex.

512
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,232
I'm just calling to say hi.

513
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:28,568
Um, just give me a call back,
whenever you get in.

514
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:29,669
Hello? Hello?

515
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,504
Hello? Marnie.

516
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:33,340
Hey, what's going on?
How are you?

517
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:37,444
Uh, hold on a second. Hold on.

518
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:39,178
Hi. Hi. Sorry about that.

519
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:42,282
Sorry.
Just like some racket.

520
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:43,216
What's goin' on?

521
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,352
Nothing much.
How are you?

522
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:48,588
Oh, I'm just kinda
hangin' out today, and stuff.

523
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:51,424
Listen, I was talking
to my sister, earlier,

524
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,160
and y'all were hanging out
the other day, right?

525
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,995
Last night?

526
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:00,733
It was what?!

527
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:02,635
What? Hello?

528
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,273
Oh, sorry, never mind.

529
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,841
So, and she was... I don't know,
she was just saying like...

530
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,743
She was saying some crazy stuff,

531
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:12,412
and I don't know,
and I was just wondering

532
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,647
what you all were
talking about yesterday.

533
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:17,350
Well...

534
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,185
Ah... I don't know.

535
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:23,490
I mean, we talked about a lot
of stuff, I guess. I mean...

536
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,958
I don't know, I mean, she just
said some... I don't know.

537
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:28,295
It sounded like she was
giving you some crazy regard,

538
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:31,364
some crazy advice
regarding me, and I was just...

539
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,766
I don't know, it's just...

540
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,902
I mean,
you know what I'm saying?

541
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:38,671
It just... it just is
a bad time for me right now,

542
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:41,408
and like... and I just
don't want her to...

543
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,410
And she... what? Go ahead.

544
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:46,679
I guess, I mean, we've talked
about this before, I guess.

545
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:50,817
I mean, I sort of...
You know, I sort of...

546
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:55,888
She made it sound like
she was trying to encourage you

547
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,990
to make
a move on me, I guess,

548
00:20:58,024 --> 00:20:59,892
because she said that
you liked me still

549
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,461
and that I...
And that I was single and all.

550
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,195
It this is
all true and stuff,

551
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:06,032
and I... you know,
I obviously think a lot of you,

552
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:08,801
but I just didn't want...
I'm just...

553
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:11,170
It just seemed like
a asshole move.

554
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,406
I mean, she...
You know, she brought it up.

555
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,408
I just... um...

556
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,456
Yeah. No. No, I know.

557
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,924
I mean, I... I didn't...

558
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:35,261
I definitely wasn't
planning on, you know, like...

559
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,231
I don't know,
doing anything or, uh...

560
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:43,370
I just... I just...

561
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,672
You know, I know that
this is a crazy time

562
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:48,074
for you and stuff.
I just... you know, she...

563
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:51,811
I didn't... she just
brought it up and so I...

564
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:53,846
I don't know. Um...

565
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:01,554
Well, uh...

566
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:03,623
Well, anyway,
and also, I just...

567
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,492
I shouldn't be talking
about this right now anyhow.

568
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:08,060
It's a stupid mistake
to be calling you about it.

569
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:09,596
Because it's just...
I don't know,

570
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:11,931
it's just dumb conversation
to have over the phone.

571
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:15,402
Um, but... but we should,
I don't know,

572
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:17,737
we should talk about it more,
just not right now.

573
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:21,674
It's just kinda... that's
kind of a bad idea, I think.

574
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,744
So, can I just
call you later, or something?

575
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:28,648
Ok... ok. Ok. Ok, bye.

576
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:29,849
Bye.

577
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:40,259
Fuck. Fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

578
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,332
God.

579
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,564
Well, it was just stupid.

580
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:19,699
It was just kind
of a bad idea to call, so...

581
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:20,900
Well, what happened?

582
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,803
Nothing, we were just both
kinda like... rrrr.

583
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:25,572
It was... it was just
so stupid to call.

584
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:26,706
I don't know what I was thinking.

585
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,040
You were totally right.

586
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,476
You didn't... I mean,
you weren't mean to her

587
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:31,844
by any means, were you? Or...

588
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:33,580
No, no.
No, no, of course not.

589
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:36,082
It didn't get like that. It was just...
there was no emotion.

590
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,551
It was like a pointless phone call.
No one likes those.

591
00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:41,921
Speaking of phone calls,
hold on just a second.

592
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:43,055
Hello?

593
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:45,692
Oh, hey, Marnie,
what's going on?

594
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:48,561
Well, um, I just got off
the phone with your brother,

595
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:52,431
and, uh, I don't know,
I guess we just had

596
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:55,334
this like really
weird conversation.

597
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:59,806
It was just, um... I don't know,
I guess, it just like...

598
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,207
It was kind of
out of the blue,

599
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,811
like he just
called me up and, um...

600
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:09,516
I don't know, I just... eh...
It went like really quickly,

601
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:12,519
and I just kinda
made a fool of myself.

602
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:15,988
I don't know, I guess
he was just like bringing up...

603
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:17,490
I guess you talked to him,

604
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:19,258
and, like, he was
talking about all this stuff

605
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,862
that we discussed last night.

606
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:26,265
Um, I don't know,
it just... I...

607
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,869
It just went badly, I guess.
I don't know, what did like...

608
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:31,904
I'm just wondering,
what did you tell him?

609
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:34,541
Yeah, I mean I told him that,
you know, I thought that maybe

610
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:36,876
you guys going out
would be a good possibility.

611
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:38,578
I mean, he's single now,

612
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:41,480
and, I mean,
he talks about you a lot.

613
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:42,982
And, I mean,
I just didn't think like

614
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,951
what we said was
in confidence, you know?

615
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:51,724
No, I don't know,
I mean, I just, um...

616
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:54,160
No, I mean, it wasn't
like a big secret, I guess.

617
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:55,461
It was just...

618
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,329
I wasn't really expecting him to...

619
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:01,000
Was he mean to you, or...?

620
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,504
Just didn't work out?

621
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,185
Do you feel like a master? You
know what? You don't have to...

622
00:25:23,222 --> 00:25:24,924
Hi, what's up?

623
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:25,892
How are you?

624
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:27,459
I'm gonna run home for the other rum.

625
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:28,861
Go... for it.

626
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:30,096
Pour yourself a clean glass.

627
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,569
Hey.

628
00:25:36,603 --> 00:25:37,570
Hi.

629
00:25:37,604 --> 00:25:38,370
I'm sorry, I forgot your...

630
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:39,038
I'm Marnie.

631
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:39,806
Marnie.

632
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:40,840
You are Wyatt?

633
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,541
Wyatt, right.
How's it been going?

634
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:44,944
Oh, just...

635
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:47,013
Drinkin' wine...

636
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,047
Something about the wine?

637
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,482
...losin' my mind.

638
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:51,183
What'd you say?

639
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:52,484
Nothing. It's... no.

640
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:54,053
Losing your mind?

641
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:55,487
What about you?
Engineering?

642
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:57,423
Yeah. Well, that's
not all I do, but yeah.

643
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:59,125
Oh! I didn't mean
it in a bad way.

644
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:00,326
No, no, I know, I know.

645
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,628
I like engineering.

646
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:03,529
So, I have been doing
some engineering, actually.

647
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,597
Ok, well...

648
00:26:04,631 --> 00:26:06,065
Yep.

649
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:07,767
I hope you don't think
I'm a jerk for saying...

650
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,968
Talking about engineering.

651
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:11,738
But uh... I will pour you
a drink to make up for it.

652
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:12,939
How about that?

653
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:14,941
I don't think you're
a jerk, but I actually...

654
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:17,810
You have a drink.
Okay, well, drink up.

655
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:19,812
A little toast to...

656
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:20,747
How are you guys doing?

657
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,149
Fine. We're
toasting to engineering.

658
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:25,718
Oh, of course.
I mean, how could you not?

659
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:29,155
So, you guys know each other?
You met?

660
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:31,323
We met at that dinner,
the engineering dinner.

661
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:32,258
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

662
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:33,726
How are you?

663
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,127
I'm good, I'm good.

664
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:36,395
I'm just,
you know, socializing...

665
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,063
Partying.

666
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,597
Partying. You know.

667
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:40,066
That's good.

668
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,369
I don't know. I'm just like,
sitting around when I was a kid

669
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:44,436
thinking about nuns.

670
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,772
Oh, yeah, just like me.

671
00:26:45,805 --> 00:26:46,806
Yeah?

672
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,741
Yeah, real common
childhood fascination.

673
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:50,576
It's good stuff, yeah.

674
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,112
I guess. I mean, what
about them? Like you said...

675
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:54,881
I don't know.

676
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:56,248
No, I would
also wonder stuff like,

677
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:59,051
ok, so, say you're like
a fallen woman, you know?

678
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:01,453
Is it too late for you
to become a nun?

679
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:03,122
What do you mean,
"fallen woman"? Like...

680
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:04,290
You know...

681
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:07,426
I think of, like,
1940's when you say that.

682
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,928
Well, that could be.

683
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,462
I mean, I'm talking about
like a...

684
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:13,432
Someone who's not totally
chaste their whole life.

685
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,101
Oh, yeah, I see
what you're saying.

686
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,869
Then is it...
Is it too late?

687
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:20,139
Or, you know, can you be
redeemed and become a nun?

688
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:21,207
Why, is this like a...

689
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,341
I wonder still.

690
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,777
Are you thinking
of joining a convent?

691
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:26,979
I don't know,
I've given it a thought.

692
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:30,382
But, I mean, it more...
Probably not tonight.

693
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,820
I don't know,
maybe like when you...

694
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:36,188
You know, you could go in
tomorrow to the convent

695
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:37,957
and sign a piece of paper

696
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,427
and get your habit
and it washes your sins away.

697
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,962
They'll just absolve you
of everything you ever did.

698
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,130
I don't know.

699
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,932
Great, so I don't
have to worry about it.

700
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:48,167
Yeah.

701
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:04,016
Um... um... I'm sorry.

702
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,684
I don't... I don't know.

703
00:28:05,718 --> 00:28:08,721
Yeah, actually,
it's ok. Um...

704
00:28:08,755 --> 00:28:09,856
I'm... I'm sorry.

705
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:13,025
No. Uh, no.
Me too.

706
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:16,195
Um...

707
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:17,296
Yo, dudes!

708
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:18,630
Hey, Wyatt, man.

709
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:21,167
Right on, right on.
It's been good seein' ya.

710
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,335
Good seeing you too.

711
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:24,503
Bye, you guys.

712
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:30,276
The hippinest man
in a small town, you know?

713
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:31,778
The hippinest.

714
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:34,914
You have all things to tell
the citizenry about this hat.

715
00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:37,249
You look fantastic.

716
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:38,084
Hey, Dave.

717
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:39,118
Marnie, Marnie, Marnie.

718
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:40,486
Dave, I gotta go, ok?

719
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:41,821
I'm on my way out.

720
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:43,956
No. Come on, you gotta sit
on my lap one time before

721
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,491
you leave.
One round of lap-sitting.

722
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:46,759
I don't know, Dave...

723
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:49,328
Please. Please.
Vacant lap. Vacant.

724
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:52,698
You gotta do it for me.
There we go. There we go.

725
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,901
You know you wanted to.
There we go.

726
00:28:54,934 --> 00:28:58,337
Hey, this is a good thing...
You know, you can represent me

727
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,773
to... to Jeff here.
Could you endorse me?

728
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:01,740
Can you tell him...

729
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:03,442
Why should I...
I endorse you?

730
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,144
Are you having
a pleasant experience?

731
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:06,645
Am I the first one
to sit in your lap?

732
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:07,914
No, of course not.

733
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:10,850
Uh, uh, ya know, Rachel
was here earlier this evening.

734
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:13,319
All right, well,
you know, it's legit.

735
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:16,322
And I... I've basically
just been working on

736
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,891
Jeff the whole night,
after that, after Rachel.

737
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:21,227
Jeff, now with
Marnie's endorsement here,

738
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,895
you gotta give it a shot, man.

739
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:25,798
This is... you know, this is
the chance of a lifetime

740
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:28,567
to test, uh,
social theory in action.

741
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,902
I endorse it.

742
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:30,970
All right, all right.

743
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:32,038
She's having a good time here.

744
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:33,272
All right, all right.
Keep her.

745
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:37,709
Right there?

746
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:38,577
All right, settle in.

747
00:29:40,813 --> 00:29:41,447
Here we go.

748
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,114
Hey!

749
00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:42,882
Eh... mmm.

750
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:44,516
Come on.

751
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,885
There, now isn't that nice?

752
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:48,120
It's better than you thought, isn't it?

753
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:49,856
Somewhat better.
But bony.

754
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:51,790
You must admit, you're a little bit
turned on, right?

755
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:53,826
Aw, Marnie,
come on, don't ruin this!

756
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,227
You talkin' to me or him?

757
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:56,896
You ruined this.

758
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:59,198
No, no, I don't think so.

759
00:29:59,231 --> 00:29:59,899
Aw.

760
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:00,732
Hey, sweetie.

761
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:01,901
Hey, baby, how ya doin'?

762
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:03,302
Good. What are you doin'?

763
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:05,404
Caressing the guests.

764
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:07,840
You know,
a little forced intimacy here.

765
00:30:07,874 --> 00:30:09,175
Yeah, what's new?

766
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:12,311
Yeah, yeah, you know,
it's my same old party trick.

767
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:13,712
Uh, you know...

768
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,182
I think Jeff's having
a pretty good time, though.

769
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:17,749
Yeah? Really? Are you?

770
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:20,052
Yeah.
It's not sexual.

771
00:30:20,086 --> 00:30:23,555
It's not sexual, and he's
comfortable. It's all confirmed.

772
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:26,025
Well, you guys, you all
look very happy, so I gotta go.

773
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:28,194
And so... goodbye.

774
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:29,461
Oh, Marnie, come on.

775
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:30,529
No, it's time for me to go.

776
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,131
Listen, at least...
Come on, let's...

777
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,332
Come on,
I got in your lap.

778
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:35,868
Yeah.
Whoa, buddy, I'm sorry.

779
00:30:35,902 --> 00:30:37,236
At least let...

780
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:39,205
Come on, are you gonna
be ok driving home?

781
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:40,539
Yeah, no,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

782
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,909
At least let me give you
a walk to your car, ok?

783
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:44,410
All right, I'll...
Come take a walk.

784
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:52,718
I'll be fine.

785
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:56,755
Is everything cool
with you and Alex and all that?

786
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:02,228
No. I mean, status quo,
you know, I guess, but...

787
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:03,896
I'll be all right.

788
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,697
All right, well, if you ever
need someone to talk to,

789
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:07,166
you know, give me a call.

790
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:10,069
Ok. Thanks, Dave.
Good night.

791
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:11,103
All right.

792
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:29,588
Hey. You need
a ride somewhere?

793
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:34,226
No, I just wanted to make
sure that you're gonna be ok.

794
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,596
Yeah. I mean,
this is a weird time,

795
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,565
you know?
But uh...

796
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:41,900
I'm ok.

797
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:43,002
Ok.

798
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:45,137
And I mean,
come on. I don't...

799
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:47,239
This is boring, you know,
I don't wanna talk about me.

800
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:50,309
It's not fair to you,
and it's... I mean...

801
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:51,410
I don't know.
How are you doing?

802
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:56,782
I don't know.
I mean, I'm ok. I'm ok.

803
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,546
Marnie,
I like you a lot.

804
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:30,182
Oh,
I like you too, Dave.

805
00:32:30,216 --> 00:32:31,450
I feel bad, though.

806
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:32,518
No, don't feel bad.

807
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:35,187
I don't care,
I don't care. It's ok.

808
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:37,023
No, come on.
Don't feel bad.

809
00:32:37,056 --> 00:32:40,559
But you know,
your girlfriend's right up,

810
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:43,229
right up there.
There she is. You know?

811
00:32:43,262 --> 00:32:44,596
True.

812
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:47,599
Well...

813
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:51,270
All right, look.
I guess I should go.

814
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,540
Are you gonna,
I mean... are things cool?

815
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:57,009
Look, I'm sorry.
I mean, I just, look.

816
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:05,351
Ok, ok, ok.

817
00:33:05,384 --> 00:33:07,886
Look, are you sure
everything's...

818
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,289
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. It's fine.

819
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,657
All right.

820
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,293
Good night.

821
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,528
Good night.

822
00:33:16,562 --> 00:33:17,329
It's fine.

823
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:18,097
You sure?

824
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:21,300
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

825
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,501
I'm fine.

826
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:26,505
So, how was your weekend?

827
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,040
Oh, it was all right.
How was yours?

828
00:33:28,074 --> 00:33:29,875
Uh, it's fine,
I think. I don't know.

829
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:32,010
I'm saying
I don't really remember.

830
00:33:32,044 --> 00:33:34,213
Well, maybe it was
really great, then.

831
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:36,615
That's a definite possibility.
It might... perhaps it's all

832
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:39,751
just lost in the giant
drug haze or...

833
00:33:39,785 --> 00:33:40,686
Hi guys.

834
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:41,887
Morning.

835
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,690
Marnie, uh,
today's your last day, huh?

836
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:45,957
Oh yeah, yeah.

837
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:48,060
Well, we're gonna miss you.

838
00:33:48,094 --> 00:33:49,661
Mitchell, would you stay here

839
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,730
and do some data entry,
and Marnie, I think

840
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:54,533
they could use you on
phones for a couple of hours.

841
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:56,202
Sure. See ya.

842
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,370
Good morning, inteletec.

843
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,872
May I tell him who's calling?

844
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:02,208
Ok, one moment.

845
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,946
Hi. Phil, I have Jeffrey
livermore on line two for you?

846
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,248
Ok.

847
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:18,524
I cannot believe you completely
usurped my phone position

848
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,559
that I had worked so hard
to achieve.

849
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:22,761
I don't think it's
anything personal, I mean...

850
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,096
No, I'm sure it's not. I'm sure

851
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,697
you're much more
pleasant-sounding than I am.

852
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:27,233
Pleasant-sounding maybe.

853
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:29,401
Right. Well, so, what's...

854
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:31,903
Is this true,
that you're leaving us?

855
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:33,239
Oh, yeah, yeah.

856
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:35,841
I hate temping.
I hate it.

857
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:38,877
Fucking tell me
about it. I understand.

858
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:41,513
Well, what are you gonna do?

859
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:43,649
I don't know. I think
I'm just gonna try to get a job

860
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:45,951
waiting tables,
or something.

861
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:48,254
That's cool. That sounds,
it's a great idea.

862
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:49,655
Yeah. I'll be all right.

863
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:52,691
Well that's a bummer, you know?
I'll miss you.

864
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:54,059
Oh, well...

865
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:59,030
Anyway, I'm gonna go back in
before Kimberly catches me,

866
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:00,432
uh, dragging ass, or whatever.

867
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:01,700
Ok, well, have fun.

868
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:03,135
I'll try.

869
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,714
Hey, Marnie?

870
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:18,484
Hi.

871
00:35:18,517 --> 00:35:21,620
Um, I don't know,
it's such a weird, like,

872
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:24,022
oppressive environment
in there, and... I, uh,

873
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:25,557
I always feel
weird in my, in my like,

874
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:27,826
get-up,
my work clothes, whatever.

875
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,761
But um, I don't know.

876
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,897
I just, I think, uh,
I've enjoyed knowing you,

877
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,932
and you seem real cool
and everything, um...

878
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,000
Oh, thanks.

879
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:37,503
Oh. Well...
So, I guess, uh,

880
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:40,005
I don't know if it
makes sense for us to, uh,

881
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:41,307
if you wanted
to like, hang out

882
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,175
sometime, or like,
go out sometime?

883
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:43,975
Oh, um,

884
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:45,311
I think it would be...

885
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:46,978
Yeah, I mean...

886
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:48,347
Uh...huh...

887
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,217
I don't know if I can
really go out with you.

888
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,017
No, no, no.
That's understood.

889
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,419
I mean...

890
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:55,086
You know, I meant
to ask that, but it was also...

891
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,089
But no, I'd love
to hang out, I mean...

892
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,392
Exactly. I would love
to hang out as well.

893
00:36:00,426 --> 00:36:02,694
So, why don't I get
your number?

894
00:36:02,728 --> 00:36:05,464
Yeah. Absolutely.

895
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:06,465
You could, uh,

896
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,967
you know, we could
get together sometime

897
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,469
or hang out or something.

898
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,638
I did not mean
to sound like a jerk, there.

899
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:13,705
You didn't at all,
I'm sure.

900
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:16,141
Obviously,
you have a boyfriend, and...

901
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:16,808
Yeah...

902
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:19,010
Yeah. Of course. Uh,

903
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:21,380
but um...
But, yeah. Please...

904
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:22,781
I'll give you a call.

905
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:25,784
And I think, you know, we could
go out and have some good times.

906
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:27,453
Ok.

907
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:28,454
So, uh. Cool.

908
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:30,622
Keep it real at inteletec

909
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:33,625
and stuff, and I will
hang out with you soon.

910
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:34,293
All right.

911
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:35,461
Ok. Bye.

912
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:45,103
<i>Monday, 4.28 pm.</i>

913
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:47,339
<i>Hey, Marnie. This is Alex.</i>

914
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:49,441
<i>I was just calling...</i>

915
00:36:49,475 --> 00:36:53,512
<i>Monday, 4.28 pm.</i>

916
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,781
<i>Hey, Marnie. This is Alex.</i>

917
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:57,449
<i>I was just calling because</i>

918
00:36:57,483 --> 00:36:59,618
<i>I don't know if you're still
looking for a job or anything,</i>

919
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:01,953
<i>but my uncle
is a religion professor</i>

920
00:37:01,987 --> 00:37:05,757
<i>and he's got some things
that he needs help with.</i>

921
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:07,626
<i>So, um...</i>

922
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:11,530
<i>And he... I'm not sure if
he's gonna see people tomorrow,</i>

923
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:14,366
<i>or interview people
or something, so,</i>

924
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,802
<i>give me a call. Maybe I can
hook you up with that.</i>

925
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:19,070
<i>In any event,
you should also give me a call,</i>

926
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:21,807
<i>'cause we should have coffee
or something some time soon.</i>

927
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:27,713
<i>So, uh, yeah. I'm at
the office right now...</i>

928
00:37:31,317 --> 00:37:33,485
Hi. I brought us beers.

929
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:34,620
Cold ones.

930
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:36,187
Thank you.

931
00:37:38,324 --> 00:37:41,593
Actually, I gave up drinking
a couple of days ago, kind of.

932
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:42,260
Huh?

933
00:37:42,294 --> 00:37:43,429
But since you...

934
00:37:43,462 --> 00:37:44,563
Why would you do that?

935
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,698
I don't know. It wasn't
going that well for me.

936
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:47,966
What? You weren't
getting it down?

937
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,134
Bit this looks nice.

938
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:50,502
I'll just have this one.

939
00:37:50,536 --> 00:37:52,804
No, I can get you a soda
or something if you'd rather.

940
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:54,239
I can have just one.

941
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,742
No, no. It's no big deal.
It's no big deal. Here.

942
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:57,643
You want something else?

943
00:37:57,676 --> 00:37:59,711
Well, no... no.

944
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:01,246
I'll put it right here.

945
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,949
You can have it for later
or whatever. It's no big deal.

946
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:07,353
Hold on. Let me get that.

947
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:11,189
Hello?

948
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:14,560
Hello.
I left my keys up there,

949
00:38:14,593 --> 00:38:16,061
can you let me in, dude?

950
00:38:16,094 --> 00:38:18,964
Ok. Hold on a second.
I'll be right down.

951
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:20,732
Hey, uh...

952
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:22,267
Jed has locked himself
out again,

953
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,770
so I gotta go let him down...
Or in, or something.

954
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,137
So, but after that,

955
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:27,906
do you wanna get something
to eat, or get out of here?

956
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:28,707
Sure.

957
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,975
Ok. So, I'll be right back.

958
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:30,909
Ok.

959
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:46,585
He failed to beat that level
of "Sonic the hedgehog",

960
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:51,122
so, now he's, like,
on this army base in Alabama.

961
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:52,057
Are you ready to go?

962
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,559
Hey.

963
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:55,226
How's it going?

964
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,628
What, uh...

965
00:39:56,662 --> 00:39:57,963
Want a gummi bear?

966
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:01,366
Uh, sure. Yes.
Thank you.

967
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,636
Uh, what...
You look amazing.

968
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,303
Yeah?

969
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:05,971
Yeah!

970
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:09,475
Thanks. I was outside,

971
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:11,276
and you know the kids
who sit on the stoop?

972
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:13,044
The call him
a rough rider,

973
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:16,081
so, tonight I was
practicing wiffle ball,

974
00:40:16,114 --> 00:40:17,382
and they kinda surrounded me,

975
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,284
and they were yelling
and screaming,

976
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:22,621
and this one kid,
like, their leader,

977
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:24,523
is named "the cheeks."

978
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:26,224
He was just cursing
and cursing.

979
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,659
Really making fun of me.

980
00:40:27,693 --> 00:40:30,161
And so, finally,
he's like, down here,

981
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:32,330
and I'm like...
I grab him. I'm like:

982
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:35,033
"Listen, kid.
You got quite a mouth on you."

983
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:36,735
And I said something like:

984
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,470
"Little guys
shouldn't mess with big guys."

985
00:40:38,504 --> 00:40:40,038
Oh...

986
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:41,239
Big mistake.

987
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,842
There were, like, seven of them.
They knocked me down.

988
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:46,044
Beating the crap out of me,
like, throwing dirt on me.

989
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:48,046
Oh, no!

990
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,950
Yeah, and so, like,
at first it seemed really bad,

991
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:55,587
um... I mean,
I was, like... I don't know.

992
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:58,223
I think I chipped a tooth
or something...

993
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:00,125
And... but then...

994
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:02,293
Are you... what's...?

995
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:05,531
Oh, I don't know.
I mean, I was just...

996
00:41:05,564 --> 00:41:06,598
What?

997
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:07,533
What?

998
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:09,100
Say it!

999
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:09,868
Are you ready to go?

1000
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:10,536
Yeah.

1001
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:11,336
Ok.

1002
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:12,838
I'll tell you more later.

1003
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:14,305
But it actually ended up fine.

1004
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,542
I gave "the cheeks" our phone
number. I hope you don't mind.

1005
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:17,475
No, that's fine.

1006
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:18,977
He's a cool guy, actually.

1007
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,411
I think they're actually good.

1008
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:23,682
I think I might have solved
the town/gown relations issues

1009
00:41:23,715 --> 00:41:24,983
or whatever
we were having with the...

1010
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:26,384
Town/gown?

1011
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:29,487
Well, you know.
Like, us and the kids.

1012
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:32,423
The kids are gonna like us now.
That's what's gonna happen.

1013
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:34,660
That sounds good.
Let's get outta here.

1014
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:35,326
All right.

1015
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,327
I'm gonna go now.

1016
00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:38,697
Well, good luck, I mean... yeah.

1017
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:39,765
I'll see you later.

1018
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:40,599
Ok. Bye.

1019
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:45,270
Yeah, you know,
you're at least the most, like,

1020
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:48,874
"evolutionalistic" person
that I know.

1021
00:41:48,907 --> 00:41:50,742
What do you mean?
You are, too, though.

1022
00:41:50,776 --> 00:41:51,843
Well...

1023
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:55,914
You're, like, yesterday,
cro-magnon man, today,

1024
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:57,248
uh, you know.

1025
00:41:57,282 --> 00:41:58,349
Yeah, today in stasis.

1026
00:41:58,383 --> 00:41:59,585
Caveman lawyer.

1027
00:41:59,618 --> 00:42:00,318
Right.

1028
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,519
Stasis?

1029
00:42:01,553 --> 00:42:03,288
You're not in stasis.
Seriously.

1030
00:42:03,321 --> 00:42:04,222
Coffee.

1031
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,691
Oh. Thank you.

1032
00:42:12,664 --> 00:42:14,766
Oh, my god!

1033
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,101
You're something.

1034
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:19,638
Sorry about that.

1035
00:42:21,506 --> 00:42:22,874
Have you ever seen that before?

1036
00:42:22,908 --> 00:42:23,541
No!

1037
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:26,344
It's pretty good, huh?

1038
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,012
Amazing.

1039
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:27,679
It really is.

1040
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:29,547
Really disgustifying.

1041
00:42:29,581 --> 00:42:31,216
Did you know there was
that much juice in one eye?

1042
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:32,784
Well done.

1043
00:42:32,818 --> 00:42:35,086
I thought that was
the most disgusting thing

1044
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,588
I've ever seen in a diner.

1045
00:42:36,622 --> 00:42:39,891
Yeah.

1046
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:42,861
Wait till you check
this shit out.

1047
00:42:43,595 --> 00:42:45,797
Muh.

1048
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:46,798
Muh.

1049
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,400
Muh. Muh.

1050
00:42:49,434 --> 00:42:50,235
What is that?

1051
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:52,270
Muh? Muh?

1052
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:55,006
Muh? It's a cow! It's a cow.

1053
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,108
Doing what? Peeing?
I don't see what...

1054
00:42:57,142 --> 00:42:59,010
It's not peeing!

1055
00:42:59,044 --> 00:43:00,111
Yes, it is.

1056
00:43:00,145 --> 00:43:03,348
No. Muh... muh.

1057
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:05,984
Is it supposed to be, like,
lactating, or something?

1058
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:07,819
Yes! Lactating.

1059
00:43:07,853 --> 00:43:08,754
Peeing?!

1060
00:43:08,787 --> 00:43:09,988
Seems weird.

1061
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:11,690
Come on.

1062
00:43:11,723 --> 00:43:13,358
I know you made it up.

1063
00:43:13,391 --> 00:43:15,560
No, my dad did.

1064
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,764
Are you fucking with me?
You knew what that was.

1065
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:20,866
Well, yeah.

1066
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:21,633
Yes, you were.

1067
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:24,703
Yeah.

1068
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:26,171
Right. Sorry.

1069
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:29,007
You are crazy.

1070
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,643
Thanks. So are you.

1071
00:43:31,677 --> 00:43:35,847
You're, like,
the king of crazy over there.

1072
00:43:35,881 --> 00:43:38,817
Well, that's a big title
to live up to.

1073
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:39,885
I don't know what to do now.

1074
00:43:39,918 --> 00:43:41,653
Yeah, well.

1075
00:43:41,687 --> 00:43:44,489
You definitely are...

1076
00:43:44,522 --> 00:43:46,324
Not doing it.

1077
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:47,492
What do I do now?

1078
00:43:47,525 --> 00:43:50,361
I don't know. Make some
fart noises or something.

1079
00:43:50,395 --> 00:43:52,030
Oh, no...

1080
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:56,034
Well, you don't have to,
but it's always funny.

1081
00:43:58,436 --> 00:44:01,707
The wetter, the better, I think.
That's the rule of thumb.

1082
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,908
Yeah. There you go.

1083
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:06,377
Oh, that's so gross.

1084
00:44:06,411 --> 00:44:08,213
You had some spit
coming off your tongue.

1085
00:44:08,246 --> 00:44:10,281
It reminded me of something
that happened to me.

1086
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:12,117
I was just lactating.

1087
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,018
Right.

1088
00:44:16,121 --> 00:44:17,388
Right.

1089
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,830
Thanks.

1090
00:44:24,863 --> 00:44:26,564
I think that's Liz.
Can you hold on a second?

1091
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:30,368
Yeah, that's totally her car.
Hold on. I just wanna catch her.

1092
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,337
Hey, Liz?

1093
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,172
Liz? Oh, shit.

1094
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:35,807
Liz! Liz.

1095
00:44:35,841 --> 00:44:37,442
Liz? Liz, wake up.

1096
00:44:37,475 --> 00:44:39,044
Liz?

1097
00:44:39,077 --> 00:44:41,146
Hey, Liz. Wake up.

1098
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,513
Hey?

1099
00:44:42,547 --> 00:44:43,882
Hi. It's Marnie.
It's me.

1100
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:44,816
Hi, Marnie.

1101
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:46,084
Are you ok?

1102
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:48,319
I'm fine.

1103
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:51,156
You were passed out
in your car here.

1104
00:44:52,824 --> 00:44:54,259
No, I wasn't.

1105
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:55,794
Yes, you were. Look,
you were passed out here

1106
00:44:55,827 --> 00:44:57,028
with your head
on the steering wheel

1107
00:44:57,062 --> 00:44:58,830
when I just turned up.

1108
00:44:58,864 --> 00:45:00,799
That's not my steering wheel.

1109
00:45:00,832 --> 00:45:02,267
What are you talking about?

1110
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,470
Look, there's a big, old dent
from where your forehead was.

1111
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:07,005
This isn't my car.

1112
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:08,706
What?

1113
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,608
Then you somehow managed
to steal a car

1114
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:11,743
that looks just like yours

1115
00:45:11,777 --> 00:45:13,544
and pass out in it
with the car running?

1116
00:45:13,578 --> 00:45:15,180
Here, I'm gonna turn it off.

1117
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:19,918
You're almost out of gas.
How long have you been here?

1118
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:21,019
Not long.

1119
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:22,420
No?

1120
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:23,354
Well...

1121
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:28,193
Who's that?

1122
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:29,394
Hi. I'm Alex.

1123
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:31,196
It's my friend Alex.

1124
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,798
Liz.

1125
00:45:32,831 --> 00:45:35,333
Nice to meet you.

1126
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:36,935
Where are my car keys?

1127
00:45:36,968 --> 00:45:38,336
Well,

1128
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:40,638
I don't know,
I can't find them.

1129
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:43,674
But where have you been tonight?
What are you doing?

1130
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:47,012
Are you...
Have you been with anybody?

1131
00:45:47,045 --> 00:45:50,215
No, I left the party on my own.

1132
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,983
What party?

1133
00:45:52,017 --> 00:45:55,720
Um... down the road.

1134
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,655
What,
Brad and those guys?

1135
00:45:57,688 --> 00:46:00,091
I don't know.

1136
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:01,526
I want my keys.

1137
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:04,762
Well, how about them?
I can't give you your keys.

1138
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,266
Keys.

1139
00:46:08,299 --> 00:46:10,335
No, I can't do that.
I'm really sorry,

1140
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:12,037
but you cannot drive.

1141
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:13,538
Fuck you, Marnie.

1142
00:46:13,571 --> 00:46:14,405
Oh, come on.

1143
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:16,674
Fuck you.

1144
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:18,476
How about...
I mean, Alex and I...

1145
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:20,879
You could ride with me, and Alex
could drive your car behind us

1146
00:46:20,912 --> 00:46:22,647
or something like that. No?

1147
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,851
Well, just crash with me.
I live right here.

1148
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:29,087
You won't even have to walk
anywhere. It's right here.

1149
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,288
Come on. You'll be fine,

1150
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:34,559
I'll just carry you
over the doorstep.

1151
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:36,862
I guess I was
tired of driving anyway.

1152
00:46:36,895 --> 00:46:40,866
Yeah, there you go.
That's more like it.

1153
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:43,601
Come on, miss America.

1154
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,904
You can do it. All right.

1155
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:50,075
So...

1156
00:46:50,108 --> 00:46:51,910
I guess I'll be pretty busy.

1157
00:46:51,943 --> 00:46:54,179
Yeah, I can tell.

1158
00:46:54,212 --> 00:46:55,947
But I'm glad we met up.

1159
00:46:55,981 --> 00:46:57,615
Yeah, you know...

1160
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,816
Glad we had a chance
to hang out.

1161
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:00,118
Yeah, me too.

1162
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:01,086
So...

1163
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,921
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

1164
00:47:02,954 --> 00:47:04,155
Ok. Well,
give me a call.

1165
00:47:04,189 --> 00:47:05,323
It was nice to meet you, Liz.

1166
00:47:05,356 --> 00:47:06,457
Tut-tut-tut.

1167
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:09,627
Have a good time at work tomorrow.

1168
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,362
Bye.

1169
00:47:11,396 --> 00:47:14,299
All right.

1170
00:47:17,936 --> 00:47:19,604
Are you ready
for the stairs?

1171
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:29,948
Here you go.

1172
00:47:31,482 --> 00:47:33,885
Save that for later.

1173
00:47:37,022 --> 00:47:39,157
I could not believe it
when I walked up to your car,

1174
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,492
and you were just
sitting in there.

1175
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:43,194
I wasn't sure
what to do at first,

1176
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:44,395
'cause I thought
maybe you were in there

1177
00:47:44,429 --> 00:47:46,932
making out with someone,
or something.

1178
00:47:46,965 --> 00:47:50,135
No one to make out with.

1179
00:47:50,168 --> 00:47:52,603
Well, I didn't know.

1180
00:47:52,637 --> 00:47:54,940
Was that your boyfriend?

1181
00:47:54,973 --> 00:47:57,175
No. No.

1182
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,876
No.

1183
00:48:00,678 --> 00:48:02,280
Well...

1184
00:48:03,348 --> 00:48:05,450
Are you gonna be ok here,
you think?

1185
00:48:05,483 --> 00:48:06,884
Yes.

1186
00:48:06,918 --> 00:48:09,320
All right. Well, I'm gonna
go out for just a little while,

1187
00:48:09,354 --> 00:48:12,557
but I'll be back, and then
I'll see you in the morning.

1188
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,360
And the bathroom's
right across the hall

1189
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:18,129
in case you feel sick
or something.

1190
00:48:18,163 --> 00:48:19,264
Ok?

1191
00:48:19,297 --> 00:48:20,631
Ok.

1192
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:22,000
And if you can't make it
to the bathroom

1193
00:48:22,033 --> 00:48:24,669
for whatever reason,

1194
00:48:24,702 --> 00:48:26,972
I'll leave this waste basket
right here for you.

1195
00:48:29,074 --> 00:48:30,841
Ok?

1196
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:33,211
So get some rest.

1197
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,115
I'll see you later.

1198
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:38,849
Goodnight.

1199
00:49:34,205 --> 00:49:35,340
Thank you.

1200
00:49:35,373 --> 00:49:37,442
You're welcome. Anybody else?

1201
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:41,079
Oh, for beer, man?
I'm always good for beer.

1202
00:49:58,096 --> 00:50:00,098
Marnie?

1203
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:05,436
Marnie? Wake up.

1204
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:08,339
Sorry. Do you want
some toast?

1205
00:50:08,373 --> 00:50:11,008
Oh, no, thank you.

1206
00:50:11,042 --> 00:50:12,310
Thanks for last night.

1207
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:14,745
Oh, no problem.

1208
00:50:14,779 --> 00:50:19,450
I'm really sorry if I was
belligerent or anything.

1209
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:22,320
No, no, no. You were fine.
You were totally fine.

1210
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:23,888
You were fine.

1211
00:50:23,921 --> 00:50:27,392
Have you seen my car keys?

1212
00:50:27,425 --> 00:50:31,028
Um, I think they're in my pants.

1213
00:50:31,062 --> 00:50:34,299
It'd be in my pants over there.

1214
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:35,166
The brown ones?

1215
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,501
Mm-hm.

1216
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:42,540
What time is it?

1217
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:45,110
It's, like, in the front...
Yeah.

1218
00:50:45,143 --> 00:50:46,477
Got 'em.

1219
00:50:46,511 --> 00:50:49,314
Oh, shit! Oh, shit.

1220
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:51,082
Are you late?
I made some coffee.

1221
00:50:51,116 --> 00:50:53,284
There's coffee
in the kitchen.

1222
00:50:57,322 --> 00:50:59,290
Come in.

1223
00:50:59,924 --> 00:51:01,692
Professor garver?

1224
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,228
Hi, I'm Marnie cadieux.

1225
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:05,463
I am so sorry I'm late. I was
supposed to meet you at ten.

1226
00:51:05,496 --> 00:51:08,299
Quite all right.
Quite all right. Come on in.

1227
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:08,966
Do sit down.

1228
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:10,135
Thanks.

1229
00:51:11,536 --> 00:51:13,871
Very sorry. I got
held up earlier. I apologize.

1230
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,706
Quite all right. You're here
about the research position?

1231
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,543
Yes. I'm a friend
of your nephew, Alex.

1232
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,645
I have about half an hour,
I have gotta warn you.

1233
00:51:20,678 --> 00:51:22,313
I'll have to meet my wife...

1234
00:51:22,347 --> 00:51:23,181
I could come back...

1235
00:51:23,214 --> 00:51:24,982
No. Plenty of time to talk.

1236
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:26,351
All right. Thanks.

1237
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:28,419
Good.

1238
00:51:28,453 --> 00:51:30,288
Yes, Alex has spoken
very highly of you.

1239
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:32,257
Really? That's so nice.

1240
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:34,159
He's told me good things
about you, too.

1241
00:51:34,192 --> 00:51:35,993
That's always nice to hear.

1242
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:38,996
Well, I've got my resume...

1243
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,665
Terrific.

1244
00:51:40,698 --> 00:51:42,967
Thank you.

1245
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,969
Right...

1246
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:46,737
Ok...

1247
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:50,107
You've got very broad interests.

1248
00:51:50,141 --> 00:51:51,642
I guess I'm a little scattered.

1249
00:51:51,676 --> 00:51:54,011
I wouldn't say that.
This is marvelous.

1250
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:56,981
This is terrific. Mm-hm.

1251
00:51:57,014 --> 00:51:58,916
Now, ah...
You went to school with Alex.

1252
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,117
Right. That's right.

1253
00:52:00,151 --> 00:52:01,886
That's where we met.

1254
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,120
That means you must know

1255
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:04,989
a colleague of mine
named Edward hobbs, right?

1256
00:52:05,022 --> 00:52:06,791
Oh, yeah. He was
one of my thesis readers.

1257
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:07,658
Very funny man.

1258
00:52:07,692 --> 00:52:09,059
He's hilarious.

1259
00:52:09,093 --> 00:52:10,328
We've done
a lot of work together.

1260
00:52:10,361 --> 00:52:11,028
Oh, great.

1261
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:12,697
Good fellow.

1262
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:15,266
Listen, is there anything
you'd like to ask me?

1263
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:19,270
Actually, Alex didn't tell me
very much at all, so...

1264
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:20,738
What would I be doing?

1265
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:22,673
Ok, well...

1266
00:52:22,707 --> 00:52:24,542
Essentially,
it's a research position.

1267
00:52:24,575 --> 00:52:25,243
Ok.

1268
00:52:25,276 --> 00:52:27,945
Library work, mostly.

1269
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:31,182
Better yet, I oughtta
introduce you to Jackie.

1270
00:52:31,216 --> 00:52:32,517
Ok.

1271
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:34,219
She's the person you'll be
working with most closely.

1272
00:52:34,252 --> 00:52:35,386
All right.

1273
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:36,821
Would you like to
go to the library, then?

1274
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:37,788
Ok. Sure.

1275
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:38,923
Why don't we do that?

1276
00:52:38,956 --> 00:52:40,725
We can do that now.

1277
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:42,893
Is there anything else
you wanted to know from me?

1278
00:52:42,927 --> 00:52:46,297
Well, let's see. I think
the most important thing is

1279
00:52:46,331 --> 00:52:48,733
the research qualifications
that you have...

1280
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:51,168
Know, of course, this is not
the most glamorous job.

1281
00:52:51,202 --> 00:52:52,537
That's fine.

1282
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:53,604
But if you're still
interested in it,

1283
00:52:53,638 --> 00:52:55,206
I think
we can work something out.

1284
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:55,906
Great.

1285
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:01,346
Can I help?

1286
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:03,714
Yeah, is Alex around?

1287
00:53:03,748 --> 00:53:05,616
He's on vacation right now.

1288
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:07,818
Really? Did he go out of town?

1289
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:11,021
Yeah, I think so.
Were you supposed to meet him?

1290
00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:12,223
No, he just helped me
get this job,

1291
00:53:12,257 --> 00:53:14,492
so I wanted to stop by
and say thanks.

1292
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:15,726
Friend of Alex'?

1293
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,394
Yeah.

1294
00:53:16,427 --> 00:53:17,962
You hear the big news?

1295
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:21,198
Uh... what big news?
I don't know.

1296
00:53:21,232 --> 00:53:22,433
What are you talking about?

1297
00:53:22,467 --> 00:53:24,969
Um... why don't you
have a look at these?

1298
00:53:25,736 --> 00:53:27,405
Ok...

1299
00:53:30,741 --> 00:53:32,109
What... I don't get it.

1300
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,345
You see that guy there
with the yarmulke?

1301
00:53:34,379 --> 00:53:35,980
He's the rabbi.

1302
00:53:36,013 --> 00:53:38,048
And this is a wedding.

1303
00:53:38,082 --> 00:53:39,417
What we can't figure out is

1304
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:40,885
why is it a Jewish wedding?

1305
00:53:40,918 --> 00:53:43,888
I think her mother is Jewish.

1306
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:47,157
So I guess this is
probably a Jewish ceremony.

1307
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:49,093
Does it look Jewish?

1308
00:53:49,126 --> 00:53:50,861
What?
When did they get married?

1309
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:54,332
Well, we got the pictures
today, and we're guessing...

1310
00:53:54,365 --> 00:53:56,801
Yesterday.

1311
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:57,668
Where?

1312
00:53:57,702 --> 00:54:00,705
Up in Maine some place.

1313
00:54:02,106 --> 00:54:04,875
This is crazy.

1314
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:07,478
Well, it's crazy,

1315
00:54:07,512 --> 00:54:08,145
but, you know...

1316
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:09,347
Holy shit.

1317
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:11,682
Yeah, it's crazy, all right.

1318
00:54:11,716 --> 00:54:13,484
They're married!
They're married?

1319
00:54:13,518 --> 00:54:14,952
They seem to be.

1320
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:16,487
I don't think it's that crazy.

1321
00:54:16,521 --> 00:54:18,088
She's not easily impressed.

1322
00:54:18,122 --> 00:54:20,958
No, I think,
considering who Alex is,

1323
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,560
it's not that weird.

1324
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,429
Fair enough.

1325
00:54:49,387 --> 00:54:52,056
Hello? Hello?

1326
00:54:57,061 --> 00:54:57,695
Beer?

1327
00:54:57,728 --> 00:54:59,296
Sure.

1328
00:55:03,534 --> 00:55:04,201
Ok, sir.

1329
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:05,235
Thanks very much.

1330
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:06,637
You're welcome.

1331
00:55:10,074 --> 00:55:12,543
Thank you.

1332
00:55:12,577 --> 00:55:13,911
Thanks.

1333
00:55:15,546 --> 00:55:17,415
Um...

1334
00:55:19,183 --> 00:55:20,851
What was I saying?

1335
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:25,756
Well, uh...
How's that beer?

1336
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:27,992
It's lovely.
It's delightful.

1337
00:55:28,025 --> 00:55:30,428
Um...

1338
00:55:30,461 --> 00:55:32,763
How many is that
for you, Mitchell?

1339
00:55:32,797 --> 00:55:33,698
I don't know.

1340
00:55:33,731 --> 00:55:34,765
Are you ok to drive?

1341
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:37,402
Yeah, I'll be fine.
I'll be good.

1342
00:55:37,435 --> 00:55:38,803
I actually didn't drive.
I took the bus.

1343
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:39,937
Oh, yeah?

1344
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:42,006
Yeah. Do you want anything
to drink, by the way?

1345
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:43,908
Oh, no. I'm fine. I'm fine.

1346
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:46,811
Do you want non-alcoholic as
well? It doesn't have to be...

1347
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:50,347
Oh, no.
I am the opposite of parched.

1348
00:55:50,381 --> 00:55:51,549
What, saturated?

1349
00:55:51,582 --> 00:55:52,282
Waterlogged.

1350
00:55:52,316 --> 00:55:54,585
Waterlogged.

1351
00:55:54,619 --> 00:55:55,920
Well, ok.

1352
00:55:55,953 --> 00:55:57,054
Yeah.

1353
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:58,723
Well, I can give you
a ride home.

1354
00:55:58,756 --> 00:56:00,458
Oh, seriously? Ok.

1355
00:56:00,491 --> 00:56:02,026
That might be really cool,
actually.

1356
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:03,260
That would be really great.

1357
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:06,431
But it's not necessary.
Public transport works for me.

1358
00:56:06,464 --> 00:56:08,132
Ok. Well, either way.

1359
00:56:08,165 --> 00:56:10,568
But enough about me.

1360
00:56:10,601 --> 00:56:13,771
Tell me about the new job.

1361
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:16,073
Oh, it's great.
It's really...

1362
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:17,542
I've only been doing it
for a few days,

1363
00:56:17,575 --> 00:56:19,844
but it's really interesting,
so I'm excited.

1364
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,612
What kind of stuff is it?

1365
00:56:21,646 --> 00:56:25,249
I'm doing library research
for this religion professor.

1366
00:56:25,282 --> 00:56:29,554
How is the... this is crass,
but how is the money in that?

1367
00:56:29,587 --> 00:56:33,123
Oh, I mean, it's not that good,
but it's better than temping.

1368
00:56:33,157 --> 00:56:34,759
Sure.

1369
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:35,693
Are you still temping?

1370
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,862
Of course,
but not for long.

1371
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:41,499
I'm almost...
I'm gonna get out of that.

1372
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,969
Yeah, actually, it came
at a really good time for me,

1373
00:56:45,002 --> 00:56:48,172
'cause I had about negative
two dollars in my bank account.

1374
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:49,474
Well, that's something...

1375
00:56:49,507 --> 00:56:51,976
That'll buy you negative
two cups of coffee.

1376
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:54,278
But then I'd be so tired.

1377
00:56:57,882 --> 00:57:00,084
It's terrible. I mean,
it's great. It's hilarious.

1378
00:57:00,117 --> 00:57:03,654
It took me a second to get it.

1379
00:57:03,688 --> 00:57:06,356
That's a great joke.
I am very impressed

1380
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:11,328
that you can just off of the top
of your head come up with a...

1381
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:13,531
This, perhaps,
is a foolish thing to say,

1382
00:57:13,564 --> 00:57:15,766
but I was just thinking that

1383
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:20,705
that your boyfriend, whoever
he is, is a very fortunate man.

1384
00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:23,708
Well, that's nice.

1385
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:26,376
Are you just, I mean,
assuming I have a boyfriend

1386
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:28,212
or just being nice?

1387
00:57:28,245 --> 00:57:29,947
No, I'm not assuming anything.
What do you mean?

1388
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,583
Are you saying
you don't have a boyfriend?

1389
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:34,384
You don't have a boyfriend?

1390
00:57:34,418 --> 00:57:35,385
No.

1391
00:57:35,419 --> 00:57:36,787
You told me
you had a boyfriend.

1392
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:37,988
I didn't!

1393
00:57:38,022 --> 00:57:41,158
Yes, you did.
We were in the parking lot...

1394
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:43,894
And I don't know if, uh...

1395
00:57:43,928 --> 00:57:46,296
If I brought it up, I don't
remember. But it came up...

1396
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:47,397
I don't remember that.

1397
00:57:47,431 --> 00:57:48,599
No, I was being
a little too forward,

1398
00:57:48,633 --> 00:57:50,200
I think you were
trying to let me down easy.

1399
00:57:50,234 --> 00:57:54,605
No, that's not... I didn't mean
to lie to you. That's terrible.

1400
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:55,673
I don't know
what I was thinking.

1401
00:57:55,706 --> 00:57:57,808
No, you wouldn't.
Doesn't matter.

1402
00:57:57,842 --> 00:57:59,009
I'm sorry?

1403
00:57:59,043 --> 00:58:01,245
No, don't apologize.
Don't apologize at all.

1404
00:58:01,278 --> 00:58:02,680
Um...

1405
00:58:02,713 --> 00:58:04,682
Well, what else
can we talk about?

1406
00:58:04,715 --> 00:58:08,719
Well, if you don't have
a boyfriend...

1407
00:58:08,753 --> 00:58:13,090
What if I were to say to you,
hypothetically, Marnie:

1408
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:15,192
This...
This is what it is,

1409
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:17,628
this is a little dinner between
the two of us as friends.

1410
00:58:17,662 --> 00:58:21,465
But if I said to you
some time, you know,

1411
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:24,001
if I were to ask you on a date,
like a different occasion...

1412
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:26,804
Mitchell, um...

1413
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:29,006
Well, I'm just saying,
what would you say?

1414
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:31,508
I don't know. It's hard.
I don't know what I would say.

1415
00:58:31,542 --> 00:58:34,779
It's hard to know, um...

1416
00:58:34,812 --> 00:58:36,847
Well, if it's not hypothetical.

1417
00:58:36,881 --> 00:58:38,649
Ok, ok, look. No, no, no.

1418
00:58:38,683 --> 00:58:41,351
I mean, you're...
I'm not...

1419
00:58:41,385 --> 00:58:44,589
I think... I mean,
I'm having a great time tonight

1420
00:58:44,622 --> 00:58:46,190
and I hope we can do this again.

1421
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:48,726
But I... not because of you,

1422
00:58:48,759 --> 00:58:51,929
but for reasons
pertaining to me

1423
00:58:51,962 --> 00:58:54,531
I think it's not
a good idea for me to...

1424
00:58:54,565 --> 00:58:55,332
Ok.

1425
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,901
...see you romantically.

1426
00:58:56,934 --> 00:58:59,336
No, no, no. That's fine.

1427
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,137
I'm sorry.

1428
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:02,039
No, don't apologize.

1429
00:59:02,072 --> 00:59:03,608
I think you handled that
very well.

1430
00:59:03,641 --> 00:59:07,612
I apologize for putting you
in an awkward position again.

1431
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:08,813
No, no...

1432
00:59:08,846 --> 00:59:10,648
I promise
it's the last time I ask.

1433
00:59:10,681 --> 00:59:11,816
What else could we talk about?

1434
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:12,683
Let me ask you this:

1435
00:59:12,717 --> 00:59:14,284
This is a related topic.

1436
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:15,853
Ok.

1437
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:21,158
How is it possible that
you don't have a boyfriend?

1438
00:59:21,191 --> 00:59:24,228
I don't know, Mitchell.
It's just life, I guess.

1439
00:59:24,261 --> 00:59:27,698
I don't know.
I don't know.

1440
00:59:27,732 --> 00:59:28,933
Sorry.

1441
00:59:28,966 --> 00:59:30,467
No, it's ok.

1442
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,570
Let's... throw me a topic.
We can talk about anything.

1443
00:59:33,604 --> 00:59:36,473
Ok, ok. What's your favorite
TV show?

1444
00:59:39,276 --> 00:59:40,978
Uh...

1445
00:59:41,011 --> 00:59:43,681
I don't know. I don't
really watch very much TV.

1446
00:59:43,714 --> 00:59:45,683
You sure
you wanna talk about TV?

1447
00:59:45,716 --> 00:59:48,052
No, I don't care.

1448
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:49,820
Ok. Why don't you
have a girlfriend?

1449
00:59:52,389 --> 00:59:54,424
Well, that's just life.

1450
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:55,993
I mean,
you're very nice...

1451
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:57,161
No, no, no.

1452
00:59:57,194 --> 00:59:59,163
Thank you. I mean,
that's very sweet of you to say.

1453
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:01,165
But, um...

1454
01:00:01,198 --> 01:00:03,433
It's... Marnie, come on.
Seriously. It's not...

1455
01:00:03,467 --> 01:00:05,002
Well, it's not the same thing.

1456
01:00:05,035 --> 01:00:07,504
Why? Yes, it is.

1457
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:10,140
Because you're beautiful, and
because you're, like, incredible

1458
01:00:10,174 --> 01:00:11,642
and because, I mean...

1459
01:00:11,676 --> 01:00:15,245
I don't wanna be...
I mean...

1460
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:18,182
I think probably 90 percent
of the guys that you know

1461
01:00:18,215 --> 01:00:21,686
are totally... sorry, head
over heels in love with you...

1462
01:00:21,719 --> 01:00:23,087
False.

1463
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,689
True.
And perhaps you don't notice.

1464
01:00:24,722 --> 01:00:28,158
You don't know. You don't know
any of the people that I know

1465
01:00:28,192 --> 01:00:31,696
besides you. And, I mean,
I know for a fact.

1466
01:00:31,729 --> 01:00:33,731
Well, that...

1467
01:00:33,764 --> 01:00:35,632
I don't know 90 percent
of the guys that you know,

1468
01:00:35,666 --> 01:00:38,635
but I think
I'm right about this.

1469
01:00:38,669 --> 01:00:40,637
But I'm not gonna
argue with you about it.

1470
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:42,506
I think, uh...

1471
01:00:44,775 --> 01:00:48,512
"The twilight zone"
I think was a great show.

1472
01:00:48,545 --> 01:00:51,015
"The three stooges"
is a show I like a lot.

1473
01:00:51,048 --> 01:00:52,950
Yeah, that's good stuff.

1474
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:56,186
What's your favorite
"twilight zone" episode?

1475
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,755
I don't know.
They're all very good.

1476
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:12,636
Hey, Marnie.
I'm leaving now.

1477
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:13,838
You can go home
if you want.

1478
01:01:13,871 --> 01:01:16,140
Ok. Thanks, Jackie.
See you later.

1479
01:01:21,078 --> 01:01:22,479
There's Marnie.

1480
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:23,447
Marnie.

1481
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,249
Hey, Marnie.

1482
01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:25,983
Hi.

1483
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:26,717
What's up?

1484
01:01:26,751 --> 01:01:28,018
Not much.

1485
01:01:28,052 --> 01:01:28,853
How are you doing?

1486
01:01:28,886 --> 01:01:29,954
Just shopping...

1487
01:01:29,987 --> 01:01:30,721
Hey, Marnie.

1488
01:01:30,755 --> 01:01:31,455
Hi.

1489
01:01:31,488 --> 01:01:32,489
How are you doing?

1490
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,725
Ok. You guys
are all having dinner?

1491
01:01:34,759 --> 01:01:36,894
Yeah, we're gonna
cook a big dinner.

1492
01:01:36,927 --> 01:01:39,730
Each of us is gonna
do a specialty.

1493
01:01:39,764 --> 01:01:40,898
Fun.
That sounds fun.

1494
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:42,066
You wanna come?

1495
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:45,102
Oh. Well... it's really nice
of you to ask.

1496
01:01:45,135 --> 01:01:48,238
I think, I'm pretty tired
'cause I worked all day, so...

1497
01:01:48,272 --> 01:01:50,975
We'll do all the cooking.
You just have to eat.

1498
01:01:51,008 --> 01:01:52,609
It's tempting.
But I'm pretty...

1499
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:57,314
I think maybe I'd better
just go home and unwind.

1500
01:01:57,347 --> 01:01:58,883
I don't mean to be rude.

1501
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:00,450
No, it's cool.
We understand.

1502
01:02:00,484 --> 01:02:01,685
It's nice
to see you guys.

1503
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,653
Yeah,
it's good to see you.

1504
01:02:03,687 --> 01:02:05,923
Good to see you, too.

1505
01:02:05,956 --> 01:02:08,092
I don't...

1506
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:11,228
I don't know if I'm supposed
to... are you guys married?

1507
01:02:11,261 --> 01:02:11,996
Yeah.

1508
01:02:12,029 --> 01:02:13,831
Yeah, pretty much.

1509
01:02:13,864 --> 01:02:14,832
Well,
we didn't have a...

1510
01:02:14,865 --> 01:02:17,601
Big time.
Sorry.

1511
01:02:17,634 --> 01:02:19,369
We didn't have
a wedding or anything.

1512
01:02:19,403 --> 01:02:21,972
It was kind of a
spur of the moment thing.

1513
01:02:22,006 --> 01:02:24,041
Kind of under the radar.

1514
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:27,311
That's crazy.
I mean, congratulations.

1515
01:02:27,344 --> 01:02:30,347
Thanks.
That's our rings.

1516
01:02:32,116 --> 01:02:33,417
Um...

1517
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:36,553
So, Nina's gonna teach me
how to make eggplant tonight.

1518
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,388
That's my specialty.

1519
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:40,524
Well, that's good.
Always a good one.

1520
01:02:40,557 --> 01:02:42,726
She's gonna teach me how to do
the whole leaching thing

1521
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,796
and get the berries out.
Yeah. I don't know.

1522
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:49,466
You know that I'm, like,
eggplant retarded.

1523
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:52,069
True.
Well, that's good.

1524
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:54,371
I don't even know
how to pick the things out.

1525
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:56,340
Well, it's not hard
to pick 'em out.

1526
01:02:56,373 --> 01:02:57,842
Will you show me
how to pick 'em out?

1527
01:02:57,875 --> 01:02:58,542
Yeah!

1528
01:02:58,575 --> 01:02:59,476
Cool.

1529
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:00,610
All right.

1530
01:03:00,644 --> 01:03:01,378
Good to see you.

1531
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:03,280
See you later. Bye.

1532
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:06,817
Hey.

1533
01:03:06,851 --> 01:03:08,252
So, what you got?

1534
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:10,754
Oh, I have got...
I don't know...

1535
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:14,091
Well... I'm not so sure about
this. It's pretty expensive.

1536
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:15,225
Hot pepper
raspberry preserve.

1537
01:03:15,259 --> 01:03:17,427
That's good.
I heard it's all right.

1538
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:18,428
With the tampons.

1539
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:19,930
Yeah, just...

1540
01:03:19,964 --> 01:03:21,198
Two items only.

1541
01:03:21,231 --> 01:03:22,499
Yeah, those are a great two.

1542
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:24,134
Oh, I've just started.

1543
01:03:24,168 --> 01:03:27,872
But, yeah, maybe
I should stop right there.

1544
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,242
Well... well...

1545
01:03:32,276 --> 01:03:35,545
Speaking of...
I'm gonna go with my wife

1546
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:36,981
and look at some eggplants.

1547
01:03:37,014 --> 01:03:38,382
Ok. Well, have fun.

1548
01:03:38,415 --> 01:03:40,284
All right. Yeah. Oh...

1549
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:41,852
We should have dinner some time.

1550
01:03:41,886 --> 01:03:43,620
Ok. Sure. Sure.

1551
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:44,955
Just, like, whenever.

1552
01:03:44,989 --> 01:03:49,193
Ok. Well, I guess
I should just give you a call.

1553
01:03:49,226 --> 01:03:50,160
Yes.

1554
01:03:50,194 --> 01:03:51,261
Ok.

1555
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:54,198
Bye.

1556
01:03:57,034 --> 01:03:58,768
Was that weird?

1557
01:03:58,802 --> 01:04:00,537
A little.

1558
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:02,339
Yeah? Well, you know,

1559
01:04:02,372 --> 01:04:06,710
just slip off into the night
now that no one's around.

1560
01:04:06,743 --> 01:04:09,246
Oh. Yeah.

1561
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,548
Thanks.

1562
01:04:18,155 --> 01:04:19,689
$11.22.

1563
01:05:40,904 --> 01:05:43,207
I didn't think you were serious
about playing when you...

1564
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,009
Of course
I'm serious, man.

1565
01:05:46,243 --> 01:05:47,711
Well, I can tell you're serious,

1566
01:05:47,744 --> 01:05:49,213
because you're
in halfway athletic gear.

1567
01:05:49,246 --> 01:05:52,949
You got the sweat pants and
the... you're ready to play.

1568
01:05:52,983 --> 01:05:55,219
What? Don't you think
you can play in your jeans?

1569
01:05:55,252 --> 01:05:56,320
No, I'll be cool.

1570
01:05:56,353 --> 01:05:59,489
No, come on.
We can just shoot around.

1571
01:05:59,523 --> 01:06:01,125
Don't worry about it.

1572
01:06:01,158 --> 01:06:02,626
Do you know how to
play this game for real?

1573
01:06:02,659 --> 01:06:03,527
Do you know what you're doing?

1574
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:04,861
No, no, I suck.

1575
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:07,397
I played in junior high, and
I never even scored one basket.

1576
01:06:07,431 --> 01:06:09,433
So I'm just trying to

1577
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:13,837
work my way back up
to the skill level of then.

1578
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:14,804
'Cause I'm really terrible.

1579
01:06:14,838 --> 01:06:17,807
Then we'll be evenly matched.

1580
01:06:17,841 --> 01:06:19,876
Well, it might be embarrassing.
You might laugh at me.

1581
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:21,378
Play.

1582
01:06:21,411 --> 01:06:24,548
All right. Can I take a few
free throws?

1583
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:32,022
The thing is that I never
learned to shoot properly.

1584
01:06:32,056 --> 01:06:34,558
You can go to basketball camp or
whatever and they'll teach you.

1585
01:06:34,591 --> 01:06:36,860
You gotta... something to do
with follow through, or...

1586
01:06:36,893 --> 01:06:37,627
Doesn't help.

1587
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:38,562
Well, I never learned it.

1588
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,565
Do you know how to play chess?

1589
01:06:41,598 --> 01:06:44,101
Does chess seem like
it's more my speed?

1590
01:06:44,134 --> 01:06:49,773
No, no. I was thinking about
playing some chess, and...

1591
01:06:49,806 --> 01:06:51,975
I can tell you...

1592
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:55,479
I can tell you how the
pieces move. That's no problem.

1593
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,747
I can't really teach you chess

1594
01:06:57,781 --> 01:06:59,649
because my skill level
is approximately the same

1595
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:01,085
as it is in basketball.

1596
01:07:01,118 --> 01:07:04,288
Which is to say it's...

1597
01:07:04,321 --> 01:07:06,223
Terrible. Truly terrible.

1598
01:07:06,256 --> 01:07:07,524
Great. Are you ready to play?

1599
01:07:07,557 --> 01:07:09,459
Like a game? Like a real game?

1600
01:07:09,493 --> 01:07:10,127
A little game?

1601
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,328
Yeah.

1602
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:12,662
Hang on to this.

1603
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:14,531
Small, you know...

1604
01:07:14,564 --> 01:07:16,500
Yeah.

1605
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:17,534
Let's do it.

1606
01:07:31,748 --> 01:07:32,782
Who's taking it out?

1607
01:07:32,816 --> 01:07:33,917
That'll be you.

1608
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:38,688
All right. Marnie,
take it easy on me.

1609
01:07:51,535 --> 01:07:53,637
You're too fucking tall.
It's not fair.

1610
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:56,940
I can't... ok, thank you.
That's much better.

1611
01:08:07,684 --> 01:08:09,786
I believe, Marnie,

1612
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:12,021
that that is checkmate.

1613
01:08:12,055 --> 01:08:13,423
What?

1614
01:08:13,457 --> 01:08:14,224
Yeah.

1615
01:08:14,258 --> 01:08:15,825
Oh, shit.

1616
01:08:15,859 --> 01:08:17,561
No, no, no. I could...

1617
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:19,028
I could just go
like that, right?

1618
01:08:19,062 --> 01:08:19,863
No, you can't,

1619
01:08:19,896 --> 01:08:22,799
because my knight will...

1620
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:24,601
Oh, shit. I totally
blanked out on

1621
01:08:24,634 --> 01:08:26,570
how that knight can
just jump over everything.

1622
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:27,471
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1623
01:08:27,504 --> 01:08:28,505
That's the major...

1624
01:08:28,538 --> 01:08:29,939
That's the coolest thing
about the knight.

1625
01:08:29,973 --> 01:08:31,441
He's no joke.

1626
01:08:31,475 --> 01:08:32,676
Well, fuck.

1627
01:08:32,709 --> 01:08:34,611
Yeah, well, but...

1628
01:08:34,644 --> 01:08:36,613
But that was a really
good game, considering...

1629
01:08:36,646 --> 01:08:37,947
Oh, yeah.
No, it was fun.

1630
01:08:37,981 --> 01:08:40,484
You know... no,
but you played really well

1631
01:08:40,517 --> 01:08:43,620
if you hadn't played
since whenever.

1632
01:08:43,653 --> 01:08:44,821
Third grade.

1633
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:47,757
Yeah, it was outstanding.
I think if we played like,

1634
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:49,125
you know,
five more games,

1635
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:53,129
within five I promise
that you'd be trouncing me.

1636
01:08:53,163 --> 01:08:55,532
All right,
let's do it.

1637
01:08:55,565 --> 01:08:56,700
Right now, or...?

1638
01:08:56,733 --> 01:08:58,568
Well,
maybe not right now.

1639
01:08:58,602 --> 01:09:01,438
That's...
I don't think I can handle

1640
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:05,141
five more games
right now.

1641
01:09:05,175 --> 01:09:06,643
Yeah.

1642
01:09:17,454 --> 01:09:19,155
I have to go
to the bathroom.

1643
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:20,490
I'll be right back.

1644
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,862
Hey, Marnie,
can I grab a beer or something?

1645
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:27,063
Yeah, sure.

1646
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:29,065
Actually, I think there's
a whole six-pack in there

1647
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:31,201
and you're welcome
to have all of it.

1648
01:09:31,235 --> 01:09:33,169
Well,
just one I think...

1649
01:09:33,203 --> 01:09:34,971
Oh, yeah, I know, but

1650
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,607
you can take it home,
is what I'm saying.

1651
01:09:37,641 --> 01:09:39,276
Ok. It's not...
If you...

1652
01:09:39,309 --> 01:09:42,279
No, I'd actually appreciate it
if you took it off my hands.

1653
01:09:42,312 --> 01:09:43,513
If you insist.

1654
01:09:43,547 --> 01:09:44,914
Ok, I'll be right back.

1655
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:00,096
Clamors

1656
01:10:11,575 --> 01:10:13,209
Hey, Marnie?

1657
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:16,880
Marnie?

1658
01:10:16,913 --> 01:10:17,714
What?

1659
01:10:17,747 --> 01:10:19,683
Do you wanna go and take these

1660
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:22,886
and drink these
out on the porch outside?

1661
01:10:22,919 --> 01:10:26,222
Wait. Can you wait
till I get out of the bathroom?

1662
01:10:26,256 --> 01:10:27,691
Yeah. Sure. Sorry.

1663
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:29,426
I'm gonna go out on the porch.

1664
01:10:29,459 --> 01:10:33,062
I'm gonna be...
I'll talk to you in a minute.

1665
01:10:47,944 --> 01:10:51,515
Well, now you just look...
You look kinda depressed.

1666
01:10:51,548 --> 01:10:53,950
No, I'm just tired.

1667
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:54,684
Dribbling...

1668
01:10:54,718 --> 01:10:56,820
I know. Of course.

1669
01:10:56,853 --> 01:11:00,290
But you look, like,
a little bit tired,

1670
01:11:00,324 --> 01:11:01,558
or even mostly tired,

1671
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:05,228
and just a smidgen
depressed as well.

1672
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:06,396
I don't know.

1673
01:11:08,432 --> 01:11:11,234
Well, that's lame. I just think
that we had a nice day.

1674
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:13,036
I think we had
a good time out there.

1675
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:15,572
I think now is not
the time for depression.

1676
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:17,541
I agree.
We had a great time.

1677
01:11:17,574 --> 01:11:18,775
What are you getting at?

1678
01:11:18,808 --> 01:11:21,678
Well, what more
do you want from life?

1679
01:11:21,711 --> 01:11:24,280
I don't want anything.

1680
01:11:24,314 --> 01:11:27,584
What... are you
fucking with me?

1681
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:29,353
Yeah, a little bit.
A little bit, I guess I am.

1682
01:11:29,386 --> 01:11:30,420
I don't know.

1683
01:11:30,454 --> 01:11:31,888
It seems like...

1684
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:38,027
An appropriate time
to fuck with you. I don't know.

1685
01:11:39,429 --> 01:11:41,731
All I mean is that
I think we had a nice day,

1686
01:11:41,765 --> 01:11:44,267
we had a productive day, we
did all these things, you know,

1687
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,635
like I said, and...

1688
01:11:45,669 --> 01:11:49,873
You could just... if you were
here in this moment now, then...

1689
01:11:49,906 --> 01:11:51,107
You could...

1690
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:54,878
You could smile about it
or something.

1691
01:11:54,911 --> 01:11:57,080
Well, look.
Ok, I'll smile about it.

1692
01:11:57,113 --> 01:12:00,316
I'm delighted.
We had a nice day. It was...

1693
01:12:02,085 --> 01:12:03,920
I don't know.

1694
01:12:03,953 --> 01:12:05,689
What more do you want?

1695
01:12:07,691 --> 01:12:08,958
I don't know.

1696
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:11,861
A smile, or some energy,
or some... you know.

1697
01:12:11,895 --> 01:12:13,062
A little...

1698
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:15,098
I don't know.

1699
01:12:15,131 --> 01:12:17,967
I don't know. Something.

1700
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:19,235
Dancing? What?

1701
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:20,737
Dancing is good.

1702
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:22,972
I like dancing.
I'm just...

1703
01:12:23,006 --> 01:12:25,308
Well, you have to be doing it
because you wanna do it.

1704
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,844
I don't want you to
imitate my dancing.

1705
01:12:27,877 --> 01:12:31,080
Oh, Mitchell. I cannot
play this game with you.

1706
01:12:31,114 --> 01:12:33,683
It's your game. You started
this game by being depressed.

1707
01:12:33,717 --> 01:12:35,318
Well, I'm sorry.

1708
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:36,986
I'm not even depressed, a.

1709
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:39,556
And b, even if I was,
I mean, that's my right.

1710
01:12:39,589 --> 01:12:41,290
I'm just... you know.

1711
01:12:41,324 --> 01:12:42,959
Yeah, yeah.

1712
01:12:42,992 --> 01:12:46,463
I can't be zany fun
every minute.

1713
01:12:46,496 --> 01:12:47,897
I'm sorry.

1714
01:12:50,166 --> 01:12:52,268
I do... I'm sorry.

1715
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:54,904
I didn't mean to push you
or mess with you too much.

1716
01:12:54,938 --> 01:12:56,706
I'm sorry.

1717
01:13:29,105 --> 01:13:31,240
Jesus, Mitchell!

1718
01:13:31,274 --> 01:13:32,408
What the fuck?

1719
01:13:32,442 --> 01:13:34,644
Now, wait, come on...
Wait. Don't get mad.

1720
01:13:38,882 --> 01:13:40,950
Marnie?

1721
01:13:40,984 --> 01:13:42,986
Uh... I'm sorry.

1722
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,656
That was stupid, Mitchell.
It was like...

1723
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:50,494
You know, it wasn't funny and
people could have gotten hurt.

1724
01:13:50,527 --> 01:13:53,463
Well, it wasn't that dangerous.
No one got hurt.

1725
01:13:53,497 --> 01:13:55,298
But I take your point,
and I am sorry.

1726
01:13:55,331 --> 01:13:56,733
Why did you do that?

1727
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:58,935
I don't know.

1728
01:13:58,968 --> 01:14:01,571
I don't know. I am sorry.
I'll go clean it up.

1729
01:14:01,605 --> 01:14:03,106
I'll go clean it up.

1730
01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:05,308
Ok, fine.
But why did you do it?

1731
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:08,377
I just... I don't know.

1732
01:14:08,411 --> 01:14:10,547
Has no one informed you that
we're all gonna die some day?

1733
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:12,048
Oh, Jesus.

1734
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:15,752
Are you mad at me?

1735
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:17,086
Maybe.

1736
01:14:18,154 --> 01:14:19,022
Well,

1737
01:14:20,657 --> 01:14:21,991
I'm really sorry.

1738
01:14:22,025 --> 01:14:23,192
You're crazy.

1739
01:14:23,226 --> 01:14:24,027
You're crazy!

1740
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:37,741
Hey...

1741
01:14:37,774 --> 01:14:39,509
Marnie, I can't...

1742
01:14:39,543 --> 01:14:43,913
I can't talk to you
prone on the bed.

1743
01:14:57,727 --> 01:14:58,762
Ok.

1744
01:14:58,795 --> 01:15:01,565
So I'm gonna go.

1745
01:15:01,598 --> 01:15:04,768
I just didn't wanna leave
on a sour note.

1746
01:15:04,801 --> 01:15:06,836
That's ok.
I will forgive you.

1747
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:07,871
Ok.

1748
01:15:07,904 --> 01:15:10,139
I already have forgiven you.
I forgive you.

1749
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:11,474
Thank you. Good.

1750
01:15:12,609 --> 01:15:15,845
I'm sorry that I ragged on you
about being mopey.

1751
01:15:15,879 --> 01:15:18,582
It's ok.
Don't worry about it.

1752
01:15:18,615 --> 01:15:20,149
Ok.

1753
01:15:20,183 --> 01:15:21,517
I had a fun day.

1754
01:15:21,551 --> 01:15:23,252
Me too.

1755
01:15:23,286 --> 01:15:24,788
Good. Great.

1756
01:15:24,821 --> 01:15:28,291
So, uh, so give me a call
some time, and we'll...

1757
01:15:28,324 --> 01:15:30,660
I will. You wanna
play ball again some time?

1758
01:15:30,694 --> 01:15:31,795
Yeah,
I'd love to.

1759
01:15:31,828 --> 01:15:34,864
Or are you interested
at all in tennis?

1760
01:15:34,898 --> 01:15:37,033
Yeah.
Can't play, but...

1761
01:15:37,066 --> 01:15:38,501
That's perfect.

1762
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:41,204
I... actually,
a roommate of mine,

1763
01:15:41,237 --> 01:15:43,840
he's moving out, and he
left his rackets behind.

1764
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:46,242
So if you wanted to
get together

1765
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:47,644
we have rackets.

1766
01:15:47,677 --> 01:15:48,645
That'd be great.

1767
01:15:48,678 --> 01:15:49,813
We could learn
together.

1768
01:15:49,846 --> 01:15:52,415
That'd be great.

1769
01:15:52,448 --> 01:15:57,987
Ok, cool. So, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna head off.

1770
01:15:58,021 --> 01:16:02,091
Next time we see each other,
it won't be weird at all...

1771
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:04,393
No, no, please.
Don't worry about it.

1772
01:16:04,427 --> 01:16:05,361
It'll be fine.

1773
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:06,562
Ok.

1774
01:16:08,197 --> 01:16:10,667
It was my pleasure, Marnie.
I'll see you later.

1775
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:11,334
Goodbye.

1776
01:16:11,367 --> 01:16:12,836
Bye, Mitchell.

1777
01:16:43,667 --> 01:16:44,300
Hey, Jackie.

1778
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:44,968
Hi, Marnie.

1779
01:16:45,001 --> 01:16:45,702
How are you?

1780
01:16:45,735 --> 01:16:47,570
Good. Nice earrings.

1781
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:51,007
Thank you. I feel weird.
I'm not used to wearing them.

1782
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,876
Are you going out
tonight?

1783
01:16:52,909 --> 01:16:55,411
No. They're a birthday
present from my mom,

1784
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:56,445
so I thought
I'd wear them.

1785
01:16:56,479 --> 01:16:58,014
Really?
Happy birthday.

1786
01:16:58,047 --> 01:16:58,982
Thanks.

1787
01:16:59,015 --> 01:17:00,583
When was your birthday?

1788
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:01,818
It's today, actually.

1789
01:17:01,851 --> 01:17:04,353
Oh, really?
Congratulations.

1790
01:17:04,387 --> 01:17:05,689
Thanks.

1791
01:17:05,722 --> 01:17:06,589
How old are you?

1792
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:09,092
24.

1793
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:11,294
So are you
celebrating tonight?

1794
01:17:11,327 --> 01:17:12,729
I don't have any plans.

1795
01:17:12,762 --> 01:17:14,030
No?

1796
01:17:14,063 --> 01:17:16,866
I'm a big girl now, you know.
It's my birthday...

1797
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:18,567
So you're not
doing anything at all?

1798
01:17:18,601 --> 01:17:21,437
No, not really.
No plans.

1799
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,907
Why don't I take you out,
buy you a beer after work?

1800
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:26,142
Oh, that's so nice.
That would be great.

1801
01:17:26,175 --> 01:17:27,576
Do you think we could
go for coffee instead?

1802
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:29,012
Absolutely.

1803
01:17:31,948 --> 01:17:34,784
Oh, my god.

1804
01:17:36,753 --> 01:17:38,354
Ok.

1805
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:39,689
It's really your birthday?

1806
01:17:39,723 --> 01:17:40,824
Yeah, yeah. Actually.

1807
01:17:40,857 --> 01:17:42,225
What's your sign?

1808
01:17:42,258 --> 01:17:43,359
Serious?

1809
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:45,995
I wouldn't know anyway.
Here you go.

1810
01:17:46,029 --> 01:17:46,696
Thanks a lot.

1811
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:47,563
On me.

1812
01:17:47,596 --> 01:17:48,564
Oh, thank you.

1813
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:49,866
Mine, too?

1814
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:51,334
Sure.

1815
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:52,468
Thank you.

1816
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:53,536
Enjoy.

1817
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:59,275
This is so decadent.

1818
01:18:00,643 --> 01:18:01,978
Wes?

1819
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:03,780
Oh, yeah? That guy?

1820
01:18:03,813 --> 01:18:05,381
He used to work
down at the river city.

1821
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:07,183
You know the coffee shop
down the street?

1822
01:18:07,216 --> 01:18:09,819
Me and my friends
used to go there all the time.

1823
01:18:09,853 --> 01:18:11,087
Before we knew his name,

1824
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,022
we just called him
"the cute coffee guy."

1825
01:18:13,056 --> 01:18:14,457
"Cute coffee guy", huh?

1826
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:16,292
He's cute,
don't you think?

1827
01:18:16,325 --> 01:18:18,694
Yeah, yeah.
I can see it.

1828
01:18:18,728 --> 01:18:20,229
He has a really nice smile.

1829
01:18:20,263 --> 01:18:21,731
Yeah, he does.
He definitely does.

1830
01:18:21,765 --> 01:18:24,133
He's always flirting
with all the girls.

1831
01:18:24,167 --> 01:18:25,468
You should go for it.

1832
01:18:25,501 --> 01:18:27,837
Oh, my god, no.
I'm married.

1833
01:18:27,871 --> 01:18:29,939
I know, but come on.
It's the "cute coffee guy."

1834
01:18:29,973 --> 01:18:32,708
I can't even bring Dan in here.
He gets so jealous.

1835
01:18:32,742 --> 01:18:35,511
Really?
Oh, that's serious.

1836
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:36,813
How long
have you been married?

1837
01:18:36,846 --> 01:18:37,947
Two years.

1838
01:18:37,981 --> 01:18:39,648
That's great.

1839
01:18:39,682 --> 01:18:41,617
Sometimes.

1840
01:18:44,988 --> 01:18:46,289
Work can get boring.

1841
01:18:46,322 --> 01:18:49,625
Yeah. I'm thinking about
entering the NBA draft soon.

1842
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:53,062
Are you checking him out?

1843
01:18:53,096 --> 01:18:54,831
No, I'm not checking him out.

1844
01:18:54,864 --> 01:18:56,065
You were!

1845
01:18:56,099 --> 01:18:57,666
Just observing him
in action there.

1846
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:58,802
Hey, I can set you up.

1847
01:18:58,835 --> 01:19:00,937
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no...

1848
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:01,637
Sure?

1849
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:03,472
Yeah. No, no, no.

1850
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:31,767
Marnie?

1851
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:35,839
Hey, Marnie?

1852
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,443
Marnie? Hey.

1853
01:19:40,476 --> 01:19:41,110
Alex?

1854
01:19:41,144 --> 01:19:43,779
Hey, what's going on?

1855
01:19:43,813 --> 01:19:45,714
Hey.

1856
01:19:45,748 --> 01:19:46,983
Did I wake you up?

1857
01:19:47,016 --> 01:19:48,651
Yeah.

1858
01:19:48,684 --> 01:19:51,787
Well, I was coming by
to wish you happy birthday,

1859
01:19:51,821 --> 01:19:54,390
but I didn't think
I would wake you up, so...

1860
01:19:54,423 --> 01:19:55,658
I'm sorry about that.

1861
01:19:55,691 --> 01:19:56,960
No, it's ok.

1862
01:19:56,993 --> 01:19:58,127
But...

1863
01:20:00,897 --> 01:20:03,900
Well... what's going on?

1864
01:20:03,933 --> 01:20:05,902
What... are you drunk?

1865
01:20:05,935 --> 01:20:07,770
No, I'm not drunk.
What are you talking about?

1866
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:08,804
Are you sure?

1867
01:20:08,838 --> 01:20:11,074
Yeah, man. Lay off.
What are you, deaf?

1868
01:20:11,107 --> 01:20:13,209
I used to beat up
deaf kids.

1869
01:20:13,242 --> 01:20:16,345
You're lucky you're up there.

1870
01:20:16,379 --> 01:20:17,613
No, seriously,
I'm totally fine.

1871
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:20,149
You're just acting
so deranged and...

1872
01:20:20,183 --> 01:20:24,387
Well, so! I mean, I never turn
you away when you're deranged.

1873
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:28,791
Look, it's...
Do you wanna come up or what?

1874
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:33,829
Um... I don't have to.
I don't have to.

1875
01:20:33,863 --> 01:20:35,798
It's up to you.

1876
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:39,568
I'll come down for a second, ok?

1877
01:20:39,602 --> 01:20:40,469
Out front?

1878
01:20:40,503 --> 01:20:42,071
Yeah. I'll see you down there.

1879
01:20:42,105 --> 01:20:43,572
Ok, I'll be out there
in a couple of seconds.

1880
01:20:43,606 --> 01:20:45,308
Ok.

1881
01:20:47,443 --> 01:20:50,813
Well,
what's on your mind?

1882
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:53,516
I don't know.
You came here to see me.

1883
01:20:53,549 --> 01:20:57,653
Well, yeah. I just came to
wish you happy birthday, and...

1884
01:21:01,024 --> 01:21:03,826
Say hi.

1885
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:07,863
Well, Alex. Uh...

1886
01:21:07,897 --> 01:21:08,932
I don't know.

1887
01:21:08,965 --> 01:21:12,735
I'd love to sit here
and talk to you, but...

1888
01:21:12,768 --> 01:21:16,539
But I probably
should go back to bed, if...

1889
01:21:16,572 --> 01:21:18,007
Don't do that.
I mean...

1890
01:21:20,443 --> 01:21:21,710
I mean...

1891
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:25,181
What's...

1892
01:21:25,214 --> 01:21:28,952
I mean... I don't know.
It's just complicated.

1893
01:21:28,985 --> 01:21:30,153
I'm sure it is.

1894
01:21:30,186 --> 01:21:31,354
Surprisingly.

1895
01:21:32,989 --> 01:21:35,091
Yeah.

1896
01:21:35,124 --> 01:21:39,428
I mean... anything like that
is complicated, I imagine.

1897
01:21:39,462 --> 01:21:41,064
But...

1898
01:21:41,097 --> 01:21:43,599
I know.

1899
01:21:43,632 --> 01:21:46,469
I didn't mean to get in a...

1900
01:21:46,502 --> 01:21:49,138
Into a conversation about it here.

1901
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:52,976
You don't wanna
have a conversation?

1902
01:21:53,009 --> 01:21:56,012
Well, I mean...

1903
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:58,982
Yeah.

1904
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:02,885
I mean,
if it were ok for me

1905
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:05,921
to come here
to your house late at night,

1906
01:22:05,955 --> 01:22:10,159
and to tell you how great
I thought you were and...

1907
01:22:10,193 --> 01:22:13,629
And how much
I appreciate you, and...

1908
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:16,765
You know,
like all that stuff.

1909
01:22:16,799 --> 01:22:20,503
That's what I
would be doing, I guess.

1910
01:22:20,536 --> 01:22:23,272
That's the conversation
I would like to have with you.

1911
01:22:26,009 --> 01:22:27,643
Well, I mean...

1912
01:22:29,812 --> 01:22:34,050
Uh, but...
I mean, instead...

1913
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:38,554
Yeah, instead
I should probably be going.

1914
01:22:38,587 --> 01:22:40,556
I need to get out
of here, so...

1915
01:22:40,589 --> 01:22:42,225
Wait, Alex. Don't go.

1916
01:22:44,627 --> 01:22:46,695
You can't chase me.
You're not wearing shoes.

1917
01:22:46,729 --> 01:22:48,131
I'm not gonna chase you.

1918
01:22:48,164 --> 01:22:51,000
Well, no. I'm sorry.
I know, I should go.

1919
01:22:51,034 --> 01:22:53,002
Really, I should go.

1920
01:22:53,036 --> 01:22:54,803
I'll talk to you later.

1921
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:01,244
But, well...
Yeah, I know. It's just...

1922
01:23:01,277 --> 01:23:04,680
It's hard. I just kinda...

1923
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:07,383
Well, if can just
give you one piece of advice:

1924
01:23:07,416 --> 01:23:08,784
Don't tease her.
For god's sake.

1925
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:10,286
I know.
It's so hard not to

1926
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:12,421
when she gets so upset about
the thing you wanted to say.

1927
01:23:12,455 --> 01:23:14,690
Tease your dad.
Tease him all you like,

1928
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:16,559
but leave your mom
out of it, probably.

1929
01:23:16,592 --> 01:23:18,194
Well, I did it.
That's the problem.

1930
01:23:19,462 --> 01:23:21,330
Come in.

1931
01:23:21,364 --> 01:23:22,398
Hi.

1932
01:23:22,431 --> 01:23:23,966
Hey. What's going on?

1933
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:25,368
How are you?

1934
01:23:25,401 --> 01:23:28,104
I'm good. I just... I don't
know. Have you eaten lunch?

1935
01:23:28,137 --> 01:23:29,372
No. No, not yet.

1936
01:23:29,405 --> 01:23:31,974
I just thought
I'd come by to your work

1937
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:34,043
since you came by mine,
and see uncle Louis.

1938
01:23:34,077 --> 01:23:34,910
Fair enough.

1939
01:23:34,943 --> 01:23:36,279
We were talking about you.

1940
01:23:36,312 --> 01:23:37,813
Really?

1941
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:39,014
Well, I was just
talking about you guys

1942
01:23:39,048 --> 01:23:41,184
to myself
as I walked down the hall.

1943
01:23:41,217 --> 01:23:44,120
We weren't really,
but we are just, you know...

1944
01:23:44,153 --> 01:23:46,689
Just kidding, really. Sorry.

1945
01:23:46,722 --> 01:23:47,990
Jackie asked me
to print these for you.

1946
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:51,627
Terrific. Thanks very much.
That's wonderful. Great.

1947
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:54,363
Uh... did you have
anywhere in mind for lunch?

1948
01:23:54,397 --> 01:23:56,299
No, I don't know what's good.
I just came by.

1949
01:24:03,339 --> 01:24:04,940
Wanna sit there?

1950
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:05,841
I don't think that's gonna work.

1951
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,176
Oh, wow. Yeah.

1952
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:09,612
I think some fat person
already sat there.

1953
01:24:11,914 --> 01:24:12,715
No good.

1954
01:24:12,748 --> 01:24:14,550
Let's sit on the ground.

1955
01:24:25,261 --> 01:24:26,462
Every time I come here,

1956
01:24:26,495 --> 01:24:29,232
I see these same guys
playing frisbee.

1957
01:24:29,265 --> 01:24:31,534
Same two dorks?

1958
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:34,036
Yeah. Well, I'm sure
they're nice guys, but...

1959
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,538
Yeah, that's some nice dorks.

1960
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:38,241
Yeah, they're clearly dorks.

1961
01:24:38,274 --> 01:24:39,342
Dorks!

1962
01:24:40,376 --> 01:24:41,544
Sorry, I was talking to her.

1963
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:44,847
He was just talking to me.
Ignore him.

1964
01:24:45,681 --> 01:24:46,815
Sorry.

1965
01:24:46,849 --> 01:24:48,651
I didn't think
he'd turn around, you know.

1966
01:24:48,684 --> 01:24:51,654
'Course he'd turn around.
You yelled out "dorks."

1967
01:24:51,687 --> 01:24:54,757
Yeah, but you don't wanna be like,
"yeah, that's me."

1968
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:56,859
If someone calls out
"dickweed" at a party,

1969
01:24:56,892 --> 01:24:59,628
you don't turn around,
'cause you gotta play it cool.

1970
01:24:59,662 --> 01:25:00,463
Yeah.

1971
01:25:00,496 --> 01:25:01,564
It's self-identification.

1972
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:03,166
You're right.
You're right.

1973
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:05,168
Yeah. Sorry about that.

1974
01:25:05,201 --> 01:25:06,369
They forgot to play it cool.

1975
01:25:06,402 --> 01:25:07,636
Kinda uncool of me.

1976
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:09,305
I know.
They deserved it.

1977
01:25:14,009 --> 01:25:14,877
Yeah.

1978
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:16,912
How are you doing down there?

1979
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,347
Pretty good. Pretty good.

1980
01:25:18,381 --> 01:25:22,084
This is the nicest park
on the face of the earth.

1981
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,352
Yeah.

1982
01:25:23,386 --> 01:25:25,354
I'm trying to spend
more time outdoors.

1983
01:25:25,388 --> 01:25:28,357
Me, too, man.
Just 'cause you're, like,

1984
01:25:28,391 --> 01:25:30,293
in an office all day,
you just kinda...

1985
01:25:36,932 --> 01:25:38,801
Spastic Mozart over there.

1986
01:25:38,834 --> 01:25:43,071
Yeah, well, that's right.
I'm definitely a child genius.

1987
01:25:43,105 --> 01:25:46,074
Being in an office all the time.

1988
01:25:46,108 --> 01:25:48,244
Um... yeah.

1989
01:25:51,314 --> 01:25:53,148
Well, listen. I'm sorry.

1990
01:25:53,182 --> 01:25:57,019
I know I can be
really exasperating.

1991
01:25:57,052 --> 01:25:58,721
What do you mean?

1992
01:26:00,356 --> 01:26:04,327
I mean, you know.
People tell me that

1993
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:07,396
I'm a hard person
to deal with sometimes.

1994
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:09,932
Well...

1995
01:26:09,965 --> 01:26:13,302
You know...
You don't have to...

1996
01:26:15,704 --> 01:26:19,275
Whatever. I mean, here we are.
It's a beautiful day,

1997
01:26:19,308 --> 01:26:21,910
beautiful sandwiches.

1998
01:26:21,944 --> 01:26:26,582
Let's just enjoy our unexpected
view of these fucking dorks.

1999
01:26:26,615 --> 01:26:29,518
They definitely did not hear you.

2000
01:26:29,552 --> 01:26:30,819
Maybe.

2001
01:26:30,853 --> 01:26:34,390
But maybe it's that dickweed
factor you mentioned earlier.

2002
01:26:41,264 --> 01:26:41,897
Hey.

2003
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:42,731
Hey, man.

2004
01:26:42,765 --> 01:26:43,999
Hey.

2005
01:26:48,937 --> 01:26:50,306
Anyhow...

2006
01:26:50,339 --> 01:26:54,142
Hey, if you could move anywhere,
if you were moving out of here,

2007
01:26:54,176 --> 01:26:56,712
and you were in another country,
or anywhere, I guess,

2008
01:26:56,745 --> 01:26:58,046
where would you move?

2009
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:00,316
I don't know. I guess
probably a better question is,

2010
01:27:00,349 --> 01:27:02,618
what if you were 13 feet tall?
Would you rather be that,

2011
01:27:02,651 --> 01:27:05,888
or have eyes on the stalks
of your head?

2012
01:27:09,625 --> 01:27:12,428
You know what I mean.

2013
01:27:12,461 --> 01:27:15,798
I mean, you've left me
with no other option than

2014
01:27:15,831 --> 01:27:18,401
eyes on the stalks
of your head.

2015
01:27:18,434 --> 01:27:19,201
Yeah, well.

2016
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:20,569
Is that the right answer?

2017
01:27:20,603 --> 01:27:23,038
That's what everyone else
chooses. Pretty much, yeah.

2018
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:25,974
I can see it.
I can see it.

2019
01:27:26,008 --> 01:27:26,875
It's a smart move.

2020
01:27:26,909 --> 01:27:28,677
Yeah.

2021
01:27:28,711 --> 01:27:31,847
Well, you know, I really think
the world of you, Marnie.

2022
01:27:34,683 --> 01:27:35,318
Uh-huh.

2023
01:27:35,351 --> 01:27:36,319
No dice.

2024
01:27:36,352 --> 01:27:37,553
Uh-huh.

2025
01:27:40,823 --> 01:27:42,458
Well...

2026
01:27:42,491 --> 01:27:43,759
Yeah...
