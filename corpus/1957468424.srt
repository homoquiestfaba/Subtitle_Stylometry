1
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,730
( insect buzzing )

2
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,080
PATROL 2 TO DISPATCH.

3
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,700
Woman:
Go ahead, Lamar.

4
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,170
What you got for me?

5
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,170
I'M 15 MILES OUT ON THE 6.

6
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,950
LOOKS LIKE I GOT
SOME FARM WORKERS

7
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,420
HOLED UP
AT THE OLD BOWIE PLACE.

8
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,290
OKAY IF I GO
GET 'EM OUT OF THERE

9
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,010
BEFORE ONE OF THEM SNEEZES

10
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,510
AND THE WHOLE PLACE
COMES DOWN?

11
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,010
Ten-four, on that,
Patrol 2.

12
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,600
ANYBODY IN THERE?!

13
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,250
HAY NADIE ADENTRO?

14
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,950
HEY, FOLKS, PEACE OFFICER.

15
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,300
TIME TO RISE AND SHINE.

16
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,060
YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY
IN THE SAFEST PLACE HERE.

17
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,720
( buzzing )

18
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,070
( screaming )

19
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,440
THE DEPOSITIONS WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE TWO DAYS AGO.

20
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,890
NO... WE ARE KIND
OF OUT OF THE WAY HERE.

21
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,650
NO. OVERNIGHT MAIL CAN'T
GUARANTEE NEXT-DAY DELIVERY.

22
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,530
I NEED TO REORDER THREE BOLTS
OF BLUE DAISY PATTERN.

23
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,780
YES, IT'S STILL MY
INTERIOR DESIGN BUSINESS

24
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,650
BUT MY BUSINESS IS
IN CALIFORNIA NOW.

25
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,790
YOU SENT IT
TO MY OLD BOSTON ADDRESS.

26
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,910
YEAH. CALIFORNIA.
BLOSSOM MEADOW,
CALIFORNIA.

27
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,790
BLUE DAISIES?

28
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,040
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

29
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,170
I HAVEN'T GIVEN
ANY DEPOSITIONS.

30
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,500
DEPOSITIONS ABOUT WHAT?

31
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,220
YEAH. THIS WEEKEND.
YEAH.

32
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,720
AS LONG AS I
HAVE THEM BY FRIDAY.

33
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,980
YOU HAVE TO WORK
ON THE DEPOSITIONS.

34
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,100
( clearing throat )

35
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,860
DOES YOUR ENGLISH TEACHER
KNOW YOU'RE LISTENING

36
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,320
TO DAVID COPPERFIELD,
NOT READING IT?

37
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,580
YES, MOM.

38
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,190
HE GAVE OUT THE TAPES.

39
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,280
HAVE YOU SEEN THE BOOK?
IT'S HUMONGOUS.

40
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,030
WE'D NEVER READ ALL THAT.

41
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,280
( horn beeping )

42
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,530
I'M OUT OF HERE.

43
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,540
I'LL CATCH YOU GUYS LATER.

44
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,790

47
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,540
...MAIL FROM TOWN.

48
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,680
HEY.

49
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,550
GOOD MORNING.

50
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,690
SO WHAT DID MOMMY FIX YOU
FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING?

51
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,190
CAVIAR OMELET
AND ORANGE JUICE

52
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:46,190
SQUEEZED ON THE THIGHS OF
ISLAND VIRGINS, YOU DORK.

53
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,950
I'LL BE HOME FOR DINNER
UNLESS I'M NOT. BYE, MOM.

54
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,070
( horn beeping )

55
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:10,970
HEY, WE'VE ONLY BEEN
HERE THREE MONTHS.

56
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,220
GIVE IT TIME.

57
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,090
THERE'S A FRIEND OUT THERE

58
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,230
WHO'S AS ANXIOUS TO FIND YOU
AS YOU ARE TO FIND THEM.

59
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,510
SAY, CHUBBY BUBBLES.

60
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,230
CHUBBY BUBBLES.

61
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,480
ATTAGIRL.

62
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,350
( sighs )

63
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,850
BYE, SWEETIE.

64
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,240
( sighs )

65
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,620
HEY, JOHN SAYS
HE HAS SOMETHING

66
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,500
HE WANTS TO SHOW US
DOWN IN THE CELLAR.

67
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,370
IS IT GOING
TO COST US MONEY?

68
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,620
PROBABLY.

69
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,120
OH, NO.

70
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,630
HERE'S WHAT I WANTED
TO SHOW YOU.

71
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,880
OH, WOW.

72
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,420
MUTANT GOPHERS.

73
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,270
John:
NOPE. IT'S A CRAWLSPACE.

74
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,390
THE PREVIOUS OWNERS USED IT
TO TUNNEL VEGETABLES
FROM THE BARN.

75
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,640
I CHECKED.
IT STILL GOES THROUGH.

76
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,710
NOW, THE INSET HERE
IS 10 DEGREES COOLER

77
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,780
THAN THE REST
OF THE CELLAR.

78
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,530
I COULD ENCLOSE THIS
AND MAKE THIS
YOUR WINE STORAGE.

79
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,650
'COURSE IFFEN I DO THAT,
IT'LL CLOSE OFF THE CRAWLSPACE.

80
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,410
WE'RE COMFORTABLE
USING THE FRONT DOOR.

81
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,660
DEFINITELY.

82
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,160
"GOPHER" IT.

83
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,930
WE'RE NOT MY MOM AND DAD.

84
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,680
THANK GOD.

85
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,930
NO. I MEAN IT.

86
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,820
IT FINALLY HIT ME
THIS MORNING.

87
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,070
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP

88
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,570
MY MOTHER WASN'T RUNNING
HER OWN BUSINESS.

89
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,070
SHE ALWAYS HAD
PLENTY OF TIME FOR US

90
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:59,190
AND MY FATHER WAS HOME
EVERY NIGHT, 6:30 SHARP.

91
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,080
YOU AND I,
ON THE OTHER HAND...

92
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,530
WE GET THIS ORCHARD
UP AND RUNNING

93
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,420
WE'LL BOTH BE ABLE
TO CUT BACK.

94
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,540
YOU CAN HIRE SOME HELP
FOR THE DAY-TO-DAY STUFF

95
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,670
AND I'LL BE ABLE TO EASE
OFF ON MY LAW PRACTICE

96
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,130
SPEND MORE TIME
ON MY NOVEL.

97
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,010
JOHN GRISHAM, LOOK OUT.

98
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,760
HEY... I PROMISE
I'LL BE HOME

99
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,890
AS CLOSE TO
6:30 AS I CAN.

100
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,720
YEAH, BUT I WON'T.

101
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,860
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
IN TOWN TONIGHT

102
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,360
TO LOOK AT OFFICE SPACE.

103
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,120
CHAD, YOUR CAR KEYS.

104
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,210
HEY, RANDI.

105
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,460
OH, HI, MR. INGRAM.

106
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,080
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP HERE?

107
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,590
SACRAMENTO'S GOT US
PUTTING OUT THESE TRAPS.

108
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,800
TRAPS FOR WHAT?

109
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,810
A.H.B.s

110
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,340
BEES, AFRICANIZED HONEY BEES.

111
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,350
YOU KNOW, KILLER BEES.

112
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,700
KILLER BEES?

113
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,750
AROUND HERE?

114
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,270
THE DEPARTMENT OF A.G. REP

115
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:16,020
I.D.'d SOME SPECIMENS
IN TALFORD, 35 MILES FROM HERE.

116
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,410
SACRAMENTO'S GOT
THE WHOLE VALLEY ON ALERT

117
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,990
JUST IN CASE.

118
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,240
I WOULDN'T LET IT
WORRY YOU.

119
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,750
WE'VE KNOWN THEY WERE COMING
FOR SOME TIME.

120
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,870
WE'LL BE READY FOR THEM.

121
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,750
( sighing )

122
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,840
NOBODY SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT KILLER BEES

123
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,120
WHEN WE WERE SHOPPING
FOR A HOUSE.

124
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,240
KEN.

125
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,370
CHAD, COME ON OVER.

126
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,130
COME ON OVER, CHAD.

127
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,380
COME ON OVER. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

128
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,500
KEN... I, UH...

129
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,260
I SPLIT OFF YOUR 50% INTEREST
IN THE FAMILY'S BEE BUSINESS

130
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,260
AND INSERTED LANGUAGE
TO INCLUDE YOUR NEW WIFE

131
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:33,650
BUT I WANT TO GO OVER
THE PERCENTAGES WITH YOU

132
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,520
MAKE SURE I'VE GOT THEM RIGHT.

133
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,400
20% COMES FROM
HONEY SALES, RIGHT?

134
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,270
AND THE OTHER 80% COMES
FROM POLLINATION SERVICES...

135
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:41,910
SOUNDS PERFECT.

136
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:45,780
HOW MANY BEES
DO YOU HAVE HERE EXACTLY?

137
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,660
THIS LOCATION?
LET'S SEE...

138
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,530
50,000 PER HIVE, 12 HIVES,
SOMETHING LIKE 600,000.

139
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:55,040
BUT MY HIVES
ALL OVER THE VALLEY--

140
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,790
IT'S SOMETHING CLOSER

141
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,040
TO 25 MILLION IN ALL.

142
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,930
AND THAT'S
JUST ME.

143
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,540
THERE'S FOUR OTHER
BEE FARMS AROUND HERE.

144
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,800
100 MILLION?

145
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,680
AREN'T YOU AFRAID
OF BEING STUNG?

146
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,050
NO. YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE THEM
A REASON TO STING YOU.

147
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,940
IF YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH BEES

148
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,560
THEY'LL BE COMFORTABLE
AROUND YOU.

149
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,190
HERE.

150
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:19,310
I'M GOING TO NEED YOU
AND YOUR FATHER

151
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,560
TO SIGN THIS.

152
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,960
YOU AND KAREN ARE
STILL PLANNING ON COMING

153
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,320
TO THE WEDDING, RIGHT?

154
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,830
YEAH.

155
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,590
YEAH, MY DAD'S RACING A SHELBY

156
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,840
YOU GOING?

157
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,470
OF COURSE.

158
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,590
MY DAD MADE ME
PART OF THE PIT CREW.

159
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,350
HE PROMISED I COULD DRIVE
ONCE I TURN 18.

160
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,730
TRAVIS, YOU THINK MAYBE
YOUR DAD COULD USE SOMEBODY ELSE

161
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,600
DOWN AT CROWNLEY?

162
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,490
I'M REAL GOOD
WITH ENGINES.

163
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,360
LIKE MY DAD'S GOING TO LET YOU

164
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,240
GET ANYWHERE
NEAR THE SHELBY'S ENGINE.

165
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,360
BUT YOU COULD SHOW UP
AT THE GARAGE

166
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,250
AT 6:00 SATURDAY MORNING

167
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,750
AND RIDE DOWN

168
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,000
OKAY. OKAY.

169
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,750
DON'T BE LATE, MAN.

170
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,000
I WON'T.

171
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,130
SO, WHAT WAS ALL THAT
ABOUT BACK THERE?

172
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,380
NOTHING.

173
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,140
TRAVIS-- HE WANTS ME
TO HELP OUT HIS OLD MAN

174
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,020
WITH SOME RACE
THIS WEEKEND.

175
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,020
♪ YOU'RE EVERYWHERE I AM ♪

176
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,650

177
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,900
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

178

YOU KNOW?

00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,400
HE'D LET ME HANG OUT
WITH HIM...

299

MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
IN THIS STINKIN' TOWN EVER DID.

USING TO KILL THE BEES?

320
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,460
NO.

353
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,390
AND PRETTY SOON, ALL OF
THEM ARE KILLER BEES.

354
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,640
IT'S GREAT, HUH?

355
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,020
WELL, THEN, WHY DON'T WE
JUST GET RID OF THEM ALL

356
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,270
AND START OVER?

357
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,770
WE NEED BEES, DARLIN'.

358
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:33,270
80% OF THE AVERAGE
AMERICAN DIET

359
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,770
IS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
DEPENDENT ON CROPS

360
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,020
POLLINATED BY BEES.

361
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,530
THAT IS AN INDISPUTABLE FACT.

362
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,780
HONEYBEES IN THE U.S.

363
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:45,780
POLLINATE CROPS WORTH
$10 BILLION A YEAR.

364
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:50,170
THAT IS BA-BILLION--
WITH THE "B."

365
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:53,290
THEY ALSO PRODUCE
IN THEIR SPARE TIME

366
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:56,290
$150 MILLION WORTH OF HONEY.

367
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,180
WHO ARE YOU?

368
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:02,350
OH...
I'M JUST ANOTHER
BUG WATCHER.

369
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,130
THE NAME IS BEAUCHAMP.

370
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,390
( sniffs )

371
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,270
PREWITT TAYLOR
BEAUCHAMP.

372
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:12,890
BUT FOR SOME REASON,
THE BEES-- THEY LIKE
TO CALL ME "CHIP."

373
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:17,530
( buzzing )

374
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,530
OOH...

375
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,080
( chuckling )

376
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,870
BEATS THE HELL
OUT OF A CUP OF COFFEE

377
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,650
FOR KEEPING YOU ALERT.

378
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,540
( sniffs )

379
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,310
MMM... OH, WAIT
A MINUTE.

380
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,180
THANK YOU, DARLIN'.

381
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,320
THE HAPPY VARIETY
OF BEES WE'VE ALWAYS
HAD IN THIS COUNTRY

382
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,190
IS THE APIS MELLIFERA.

383
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,070
THE OTHER GUYS
ARE CALLED

384
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,580
APIS MELLIFERA SCUTELLATA.

385
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,700
FOR SOME REASON,
I ALWAYS THINK OF THEM
AS THE SHARKS AND THE JETS,

386
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:10,330
WITH THE SCUTELLATA SINGING,
"I WANT TO LIVE IN AMERICA."

387
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:13,590
WHO DID YOU SAY
YOU WORK FOR, AGAIN?

388
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,090
UH, WELL, CURRENTLY,
I AM NOT WORKING FOR ANYBODY.

389
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:19,840
THE MAINSTREAM AND I DIDN'T
SEE PARTICULARLY EYE TO EYE.

390
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,710
BUT I HAVE WORKED THE CIRCUIT--

391
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,720
YOU KNOW, BELTSVILLE,
TEXAS A & M, CARL HAYDEN.

392
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,220
WHY DID YOU STICK AROUND
OUT THERE ON THE INTERSTATE

393
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:34,610
WELL, I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT
YOUR BEE PROBLEM IS FINISHED.

394
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:37,480
BEES... THEY DO THIS THING
CALLED SWARMING.

395
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,230
IT'S WHERE PART OF
THE PRIMARY COLONY BREAKS OFF
TO LOOK FOR A NEW HOME.

396
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:44,370
NOW, TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE
ENOUGH ENERGY FOR THE HAUL,

397
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:47,490
THEY ENGORGE THEMSELVES WITH
HONEY BEFORE HITTING THE ROAD.

398
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,990
THE BEES I OBSERVED
ON THE INTERSTATE

399
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,240
WERE STILL PRETTY
FAT AND SASSY--

400
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,740
MEANING THEY HADN'T TRAVELED

401
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,880
ALL THAT FAR
FROM THE PRIMARY COLONY,

402
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,500
MEANING, MOST LIKELY

403
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,890
THAT THE PRIMARY COLONY
IS OUT THERE SOMEWHERE

404
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,500
NOT TOO FAR AWAY.

405
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,390
I'VE BEEN KEEPING BEES

406
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,890
FOR OVER 30 YEARS
AS A HOBBY.

407
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,840
I THINK THIS KILLER BEE
BUSINESS IS SLOP.

408
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,090
YOU'RE THE CAPTAIN, CAPTAIN.

409
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:14,230
IF YOU WANT TO IGNORE
THE LIGHTHOUSE

410
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,230
AND KEEP STEERING YOUR BOAT

411
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,990
TOWARDS THE ROCKS,

412
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,490
THAT'S YOUR DECISION.

413
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:26,490
YOU COULD PROBABLY WITHSTAND
A PRETTY SIZEABLE ATTACK...

414
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,740
MAYBE.

415
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,800
UNLESS YOU'RE ONE OF
THE UNLUCKY ONE IN 200

416
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,620
THAT HAPPENS
TO BE ALLERGIC.

417
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:37,370
NOW, LITTLE KIDS, OLDER PEOPLE--
AS FEW AS FIVE BEE STINGS

418
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:40,510
COULD SET OFF AN ATTACK
OF ANAPHYLAXIS--

419
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,010
SHORTENING OF BREATH,

420
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,130
FALLING BLOOD PRESSURE--
ULTIMATELY LEADING

421
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:48,260
TO CIRCULATORY
AND RESPIRATORY COLLAPSE.

422
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:50,130
COULD YOU PASS ME
THAT PEPPER, PLEASE?

423
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:54,020
IT'S STILL JUST
A LITTLE BEE STING
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

424
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,810
DO YOU KNOW WHAT "JUST A LITTLE
BEE STING" REALLY IS?

425
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:01,060
THE STING ITSELF
IS MADE UP OF TWO
ULTRASHARP BARBED BLADES

426
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:04,820
SURROUNDED BY PROTECTIVE PLATES
AND HARD MUSCLE

427
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:09,320
ALL ATTACHED TO A SAC
THAT IS FILLED WITH VENOM.

428
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,570
NOW, WHEN A BEE STINGS YOU

429
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,960
THESE BARBED BLADES
SCISSOR THEIR WAY

430
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,210
INTO YOUR FLESH.

431
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,080
THAT IS THE FIRST THING YOU FEEL

432
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,470
BUT IT CERTAINLY ISN'T THE LAST,
BECAUSE NEXT

433
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:24,720
THE BARBS ON THE BLADE--
THEY KIND OF DIG IN--

434
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,090
YOU KNOW, SO THAT EVEN
WHILE THE BEE TAKES OFF

435
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:33,090
THE STING IS LEFT BEHIND,
ANCHORED IN YOUR FLESH.

436
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,980
I MEAN, THE BEE
IS LONG GONE

437
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,230
BUT THE STING
IS NOT FINISHED.

438
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,600
IT CONTINUES TO THROB.

439
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,350
IT CONTINUES PUMPING
PAIN-INDUCING VENOM

440
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:45,490
INTO YOUR BLOODSTREAM.
IS IT FINISHED NOW?

441
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:54,870
BECAUSE THE STING IS ALSO
GIVING OFF THIS ALARM ODOR

442
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:58,090
SIGNALING OTHER BEES
THAT YOU ARE THE ENEMY,

443
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:01,210
MORE BEES ATTACK,
MORE VENOM IS DELIVERED,

444
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,710
MORE ALARM ODOR IS RELEASED.

445
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:07,210
THAT PAIN-- OH!
IT'S EXCRUCIATING!

446
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,210
YOUR BLOODSTREAM'S
FILLING UP

447
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,100
WITH TOXIC LEVELS
OF THEIR POISON

448
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:16,750
AND IF YOU'RE NOT OUT OF THERE
BEFORE LONG, YOU ARE DEAD.

449
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:21,060
SO, MY FRIEND
THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN WHEN YOU
SAY "JUST A LITTLE BEE STING."

450
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,560
MULTIPLY IT BY THOUSANDS.

451
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,450
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL THEM
"KILLER BEES."

452
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,570
( buzzing )

453
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:41,350
Preacher:
I CANNOT CONCEIVE OF A MORE
BEAUTIFUL DAY TO BRING TOGETHER

454
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,370
TWO SUCH WONDERFUL YOUNG PEOPLE
IN THE BOND OF HOLY MATRIMONY,

455
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,370
HERE AMONG THEIR LOVING
FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

456
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:52,060
KENNETH, I'VE KNOWN YOU
SINCE YOU WERE THIS HIGH,

457
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:56,430
SO IT IS ESPECIALLY FITTING
THAT WE ARE ALL GATHERED HERE

458
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,310
ON THE OLIVERTI FAMILY LAND.

459
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:03,320
LINDA AND KENNETH, MAY YOUR LOVE
FOR ONE ANOTHER ENDURE

460
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,990
AS THE EARTH
ITSELF ENDURES.

461
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:09,110
IT IS WITH ABIDING JOY
THAT I NOW PROCLAIM YOU

462
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,740
HUSBAND AND WIFE.

463
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:16,500
( "The Wedding March" plays )

464
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,010
Man:
MY TURN TO KISS THE BRIDE.

465
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:34,130
( sighs )

466
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:37,270
I THINK WE ARE
IN BIG TROUBLE HERE.

467
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,520
ALL THESE FLOWERS?

468
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,020
IT'S THE WORLD'S OLDEST
WEDDING FORMULA:

469
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,140
WHEN THEY SPEND
THIS MUCH MONEY ON FLOWERS
THE FOOD IS GOING TO SUCK!

470
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,390
ENJOYING YOURSELVES?

471
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:47,900
OH, ABSOLUTELY.

472
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:50,400
A BEAUTIFUL CEREMONY,
REALLY.

473
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:55,400
CHAD, CAN, UH, I PULL YOU AWAY
FOR A SECOND?

474
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,650
MM-HMM.

475
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,900
MM-HMM.

476
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,160
Linda:
JOSH, YOU LOOK GREAT, YOU KNOW.

477
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,160
YOU LIKE YOUR TUXEDO?
YOU LOOK LIKE YOUR DAD.

478
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,300
JOSH, THE BAND
IS SETTING UP.

479
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,810
THEY'RE GOING TO PLAY
MUSIC REAL SOON.

480
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,670
I WOULD LOVE IT
IF YOU WOULD DANCE WITH ME.
WILL YOU DANCE WITH ME?

481
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,890
NO!

482
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:34,270
GIVE HIM TIME.

483
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,280
HE'LL COME AROUND.

484
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,780
OH, I HOPE SO.

485
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,780
( band tuning instruments )

486
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:48,190
( high-pitched feedback
squealing )

487
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,420
( feedback continues )

488
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,590
( buzzing )

489
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,710
( feedback continues )

490
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,110
( buzzing loudly )

491
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:17,230
( playing rock 'n' roll intro )

492
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,380
( music blasting )

493
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,750
( buzzing becomes louder )

494
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,690
DAMN!

495
00:34:59,190 --> 00:34:59,830
( screaming )

496
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,330
OW!

497
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,700
Man:
THEY'RE IN MY SHIRT!

498
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,710
( screaming and yelling )

499
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:18,100
Woman:
GET OFF ME!

500
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:21,210
STOP IT! STOP IT!

501
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,350
KEEP MOVING!

502
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,970
OH, CHAD.

503
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,360
GET ON IN.

504
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:44,120
OH, MY GOD!
THEY'RE ON MY LEG!

505
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,630
KEEP MOVING!

506
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:09,900
I'M COMING, JOSH!

507
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,400
DON'T WORRY!
I'M ALMOST THERE!

508
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,520
LINDA!

509
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,150
EVERYBODY, COME ON!

510
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,650
LINDA!

511
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:20,410
JOSH, I'M HERE.

512
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:21,660
YOU'LL BE OKAY.

513
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,670
LET'S GO! HURRY UP!

514
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:31,170
COME ON! COME ON.

515
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,540
CLOSE THAT DOOR!
HURRY UP!

516
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,040
COME ON!  COME ON!
LET'S MOVE!

517
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,030
HEY! LOOK AT THIS.

518
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:24,150
Woman:
CONSIDERING THE MAGNITUDE
OF YESTERDAY'S ATTACK,

519
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:27,910
DOES YOUR DEPARTMENT HAVE
ANY SPECIFIC PLAN
OF ACTION NOW?

520
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:30,410
THE BEE INCIDENT
THAT OCCURRED AT THE WEDDING

521
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:34,800
IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT CITIZENS
LIVING IN A "BEE RED ZONE"

522
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,300
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT
RESPONDED QUICKLY

523
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,550
AND THERE WERE NO INJURIES.

524
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:41,050
YOU MENTIONED
A "BEE RED ZONE."

525
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,310
HAD YOUR DEPARTMENT

526
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,140
DESIGNATED THIS TOWN
A RED ZONE?

527
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:47,890
BASED ON MY REPORT,
WE WERE ABOUT TO, YES.

528
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:52,270
I WON'T LIE.
THIS VALLEY MAY HAVE
ONE SERIOUS INFESTATION

529
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,400
THE PROBLEM IS
IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH
TO SET 'EM OFF.

530
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,900
I MEAN, THE SLIGHTEST MOTION,
VIBRATION...

531
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,410
THEY PARTICULARLY HATE
LOUD NOISES.

532
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,910
OH, AND ODORS...
STRONG PERFUMES, EVEN B.O.

533
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:07,280
DO YOU REALIZE WHEN A BEE
DELIVERS HIS STING-- WHAM!

534
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,170
THAT IS IT.
HE IS HISTORY.

535
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:13,540
BUT THEY'RE STILL WILLING
TO ATTACK BY THE THOUSANDS--

536
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,790
OR TENS OF THOUSANDS.

537
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:17,920
AN ARMY MADE UP
OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF WARRIORS

538
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,680
WILLING TO DIE
TO ELIMINATE THE ENEMY...

539
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,550
( chuckles )

540
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,630
NAMELY, YOU.

541
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,690
THINK ABOUT IT.

542
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,150
( chuckles )

543
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,400
HELLO.

544
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,650
OH, HI.

545
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,540
HOW ARE YOU?

546
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,790
( children squealing playfully )

547
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,420
Woman:
THIS IS A BEE DRILL!

548
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,670
QUIET DOWN NOW.

549
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,810
( children yelling )

550
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,820
GO INSIDE.

551
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,590
HEY, JOHN.

552
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:44,840
I THOUGHT YOU'D
BE GONE BY NOW.

553
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,050
THE EXTRA PROTECTION
YOU WANTED--

554
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,530
THE WINDOW SCREENS,
THE NETTING--

555
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,720
THEY'RE OUT OF 'EM.

556
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,720
I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU DOING THIS.

557
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,860
KAREN IS GETTING
A LITTLE NERVOUS.

558
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,610
HOW BAD DO YOU THINK
THIS IS GOING TO BE?

559
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,980
YOU WERE AT THE WEDDING.

560
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,870
THAT'S WHAT
THESE BEES ARE LIKE.

561
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,370
IT DON'T TAKE MUCH
TO SET 'EM OFF.

562
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:11,490
THE THING THEY DO
THAT I DON'T LIKE

563
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,990
IT'S CALLED
"DISTURBANCE ABSCONDING."

564
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,240
WHAT'S THAT?

565
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,130
IF A COLONY GETS DISTURBED
BAD ENOUGH

566
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:21,500
THE WHOLE THING WILL JUST
UP AND TAKE OFF IN A HUGE MASS

567
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,500
AND GO LOOKING FOR A NEW HOME.

568
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,750
I GOT THIS STUFF--

569
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:29,510
SOMETHING FOR YOU AND THE GUYS
TO HAVE OUT HERE...

570
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,140
UH-HUH.

571
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,390
JUST IN CASE.

572
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,890
DID YOU TALK WITH
THAT PICKER CREW BOSS

573
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,760
ABOUT SEEING THE GROVE?

574
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,650
HE'S COMING OUT
THIS AFTERNOON.

575
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:38,900
I WAS HOPING THAT YOU
OR THE MISSUS

576
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,150
CAN DRIVE HIM OUT
FOR A LOOK.

577
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,400
SURE.

578
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,650
GREAT.

579
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,060
Man:
There's no use denying it.

580
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,060
The deadly migration
of killer bees is upon us

581
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,610
and officials say
instead of slowing down

582
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:10,680
the infestation
is actually speeding up.

583
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,300
No place is this more evident
than in Blossom Meadow.

584
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,440
Here again
is the amateur video

585
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,720
of the bee attack
that occurred yesterday

586
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,560
at an outdoor wedding there.

587
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,190
The venom from killer bees
is not any more poisonous

588
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,450
than domestic bees.

589
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,450
Killer bees are so defensive

590
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:31,570
that if you disturb their colony
they'll come after you

591
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:35,960
in very large numbers,
and all victims can do is run.

592
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,460
Once killer bees
invade a commercial hive...

593
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,930
AREN'T THEY SICK
OF SHOWING THAT YET?

594
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:43,610
THEY'VE PLAYED IT
ON EVERY CHANNEL

595
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,880
LIKE SIX ZILLION TIMES
ALREADY.

596
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,750
WELL, I WISH
I'D BEEN THERE

597
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,590
WITH A STINKIN'
FLAMETHROWER.

598
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,350
I HEARD BOB DRAKE
GOT $5,000

599
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:54,240
FOR SELLING THAT VIDEO
TO THE NEWS.

600
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,930
IT WAS MORE LIKE 500.

601
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,110
THAT'S NOT WHAT
DANNY OLSON SAYS.

602
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,910
YEAH. EXAGGERATE
A LITTLE MORE.

603
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:04,320
YOU SAW HOW THEY ATTACKED
LITTLE JOSHUA YESTERDAY.

604
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:08,070
WHAT IF...
WHAT IF THAT HAD BEEN...

605
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,320
DON'T.

606
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,190
YOU WEREN'T AT SCHOOL TODAY.

607
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:14,240
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
THIS BEE DRILL.

608
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,580
EVERY SECOND GRADER
IS GOING TO BE SLEEPING
IN MOMMY AND DADDY'S BED.

609
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,700
HEY, WE USED TO HAVE DROP DRILLS
BECAUSE OF THE H-BOMB.

610
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:26,090
DON'T THINK THAT DIDN'T SCARE
THE GRAHAM CRACKERS OUT OF YOU.

611
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:31,710
EXACTLY. OH, CHAD, I'VE GOT
ONE OF MY REALLY BAD FEELINGS

612
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:34,210
ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

613
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,720
RIGHT HERE
IN THE PIT OF MY STOMACH.

614
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,600
LIKE YOUR MOTHER USED TO GET.

615
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,470
SHE GOT
THIS FEELING ONCE--

616
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:42,360
STOPPED MY DAD FROM GOING
ON A BUSINESS TRIP.

617
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,970
THE PLANE HE WAS SUPPOSED...

618
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:47,110
...TO BE ON ENDED UP LANDING
ON ITS BELLY

619
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:51,620
ON A RUNWAY FULL OF FOAM.
I KNOW THE STORY.

620
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,230
LISTEN,
KANSAS HAS TORNADOES.

621
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:56,240
LOS ANGELES
HAS EARTHQUAKES.

622
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,990
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHERE WE GO, THERE'S ALWAYS
GOING TO BE SOMETHING.

623
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:02,130
WE ARE MORTGAGED
TO THE EYEBALLS.

624
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,380
EVEN IF WE WANTED TO SELL

625
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,330
WE'D HAVE TO DISCLOSE
ABOUT THE BEES.

626
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:07,580
WHO'S GOING TO BUY?

627
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,220
I DON'T KNOW.

628
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,080
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO TO A HOTEL

629
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,220
OUT OF THE VALLEY
UNTIL THEY FIND THE MAIN COLONY.

630
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,470
PRIMARY COLONY.

631
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,340
PRIMARY COLONY.

632
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,230
( horn honks )

633
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,000
I GUESS YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO BELIEVE
WE'VE BEEN PLANNING

634
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,870
THIS VACATION
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

635
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:44,500
WE'RE GOING TO GO STAY
WITH MY MOTHER IN MARIN.

636
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,370
WHAT ABOUT YOUR PLACE?

637
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:49,260
I GOT SEVERAL
AFRICANIZED QUEENS IN MY HIVES.

638
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,120
THAT'S WHY THEY ATTACKED.

639
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,880
UNTIL THE
AUTHORITIES FIND

640
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,790
THE COLONY, THERE'S
NOTHING I CAN DO.

641
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:58,050
I'LL COME BACK
IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.
SEE WHERE IT STANDS.

642
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:00,550
YOU'D CONSIDER
LEAVING YOUR PROPERTY?

643
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:05,390
( engine starts )

644
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:15,650
THOSE DAMN BEES ARE
SCREWING UP EVERYBODY.

645
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,400
IN LIGHT OF THE FACT
THAT THE BEE EXPERT

646
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,790
IS TAKING HIS FAMILY
OUT OF HERE TOUT DE SUITE,

647
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,610
YOU MAYBE WANT TO GO INSIDE

648
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:28,080
AND HAVE THAT LAST
CONVERSATION ALL OVER AGAIN?

649
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,830
OKAY, OKAY.

650
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:36,340
I'LL PACK LUCY, YOU AND ME.

651
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,470
KEVIN AND TRACY
CAN PACK THEMSELVES.

652
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:43,230
KEVIN WENT OFF
WITH TOM SOMEWHERE.

653
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:46,350
I'LL JUST PUT SOME THINGS
IN A BAG FOR HIM.

654
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,850
THE GARAGE SAID YOUR CAR
WILL BE READY BY 5:00.

655
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:51,350
WE'LL PICK IT UP
AND LEAVE FROM THERE.

656
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:53,240
JUST ENOUGH FOR ONE WEEK,

657
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,990
TILL THE BEE PEOPLE
GET THINGS UNDER CONTROL.

658
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:59,490
( horn honks )

659
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:02,610
IT'S THAT CREW BOSS
JOHN TOLD US ABOUT.

660
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:04,500
I'M SUPPOSED TO SHOW HIM
THE ORCHARD.

661
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,750
IT'S OKAY.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

662
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,170
IF I LET HIM GO NOW,
WE'LL NEVER GET HIM BACK.

663
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:10,570
I KNOW. THE PIT
OF YOUR STOMACH.

664
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:12,420
IT'S WORKING
OVERTIME, RIGHT?

665
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,180
DON'T WORRY.

666
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:29,020
WE'VE GOT UNDER...
JUST UNDER 34 1/2 ACRES.

667
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,890
IT'S NOT A BIG ORCHARD,

668
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:33,390
BUT WE EXPECT 1200,
1500 CRATES.

669
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:39,530
MY GOD.

670
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:13,900
MY GOD, THAT'S LESS THAN
A HALF MILE FROM MY HOME.

671
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,400
QUICK. I'VE GOT TO GET
BACK TO THE HOUSE. QUICK.

672
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:33,290
WHOA. DUDE, WHAT
THE HELL IS THAT FOR?

673
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:38,930
MY GRANDFATHER
SNUCK IT TO ME
WHEN I WAS 13.

674
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,040
I GOT TO HIDE IT
SO MY CRAZY OLD MAN
DON'T SELL IT OR SOMETHING.

675
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,180
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER
MY QUESTION.

676
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,430
WHAT THE HELL
IS IT FOR?

677
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:49,550
PROTECTION, BRO',
JUST PROTECTION.

678
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:52,060
HE SAID HE HAS NEVER
SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT

679
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:55,190
IN HIS 30 YEARS
WORKING IN ORCHARDS.

680
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:57,060
IS IT THE
PRIMARY COLONY?

681
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:58,940
LOOKED LIKE EVERY BEE
ON THE PLANET.

682
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:02,060
I'D HATE TO THINK
THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE
MORE PRIMARY.

683
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:11,320
( buzzing )

684
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,240
TOMMY, NO!

685
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,360
TRAVIS... KRISTYN...
THIS IS FOR YOU.

686
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,860
NO!

687
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,360
NO!

688
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:57,370
NO!

689
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,260
TOM, COME ON!

690
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:03,010
WE'VE GOT TO GET
OUT OF HERE NOW!

691
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:46,420
NO, DON'T PUT ME
ON HOLD AGAIN.

692
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:50,170
WELL, PULL THE CHIEF
OUT OF HIS MEETING.

693
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:51,420
YES, I THINK

694
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:55,180
YOU'LL FIND THIS
VERY IMPORTANT.

695
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:59,570
( horn honking )

696
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:03,190
( honking )

697
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,580
( buzzing )

698
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,330
GET INSIDE!

699
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:16,580
COME ON!

700
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:24,460
( pattering )

701
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:28,210
WELL, WHAT IS
EVERYONE'S PROBLEM?

702
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:36,600
( pattering continues )

703
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:40,970
MOMMY, WHAT'S THAT SOUND?

704
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,240
OH, MY GOD.

705
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,840
WHAT IS IT?

706
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:02,800
Kevin:
LOOK AT THEM.

707
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,910
Tracy:
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

708
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:06,300
THEY WERE AFTER TOMMY.

709
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,170
IT'S OKAY, BABY.

710
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:10,420
SHH! EVERYBODY STAY CALM.

711
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:12,550
JUST STAY CALM.

712
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,680
EVERYTHING'S GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

713
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:40,300
DAD, THEY'RE GETTING
IN THE HOUSE.

714
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,050
OW!

715
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:45,940
GIVE ME THE NAPKIN.

716
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:48,440
Kevin:
RIGHT HERE.

717
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,310
MOM, LOOK.

718
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:01,400
Chad:
WE GOT TO CHECK THE HOUSE.

719
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,660
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING
IS SEALED TIGHT.

720
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,540
KEVIN, TOM,
GO UPSTAIRS.

721
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,410
TRACY, THE KITCHEN.

722
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:09,290
WHAT ABOUT THE ONES
THAT JUST GOT IN?

723
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,800
A FEW DISORIENTED BEES
WON'T HURT US.

724
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,670
WE'LL GET THEM
WITH BUG SPRAY.

725
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,550
WE'VE GOT TO KEEP OUT
THE SWARM.

726
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:17,420
WE GOT TO CALL SOMEBODY.

727
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:18,670
WHO?

728
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:19,920
ANYBODY.

729
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:26,060
COME ON!

730
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:37,070
Tracy:
MOM?

731
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:44,200
MOM?

732
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,830
Tracy:
HOW DID THEY
GET IN THERE?

733
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:48,700
THE VENT.

734
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:52,460
OKAY, NOW,
COME ON, HELP ME.

735
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,210
COME ON.

736
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:01,600
HERE. START SPRAYING THEM
WITH THIS.

737
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:22,990
KEVIN, I DIDN'T MEAN
FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.

738
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:27,620
JUST KEEP
SEALING STUFF UP, OKAY?

739
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:30,130
COME ON, TINA-DOLL.
COME ON, TINA-BEAR.

740
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:31,990
I'LL PROTECT YOU.

741
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,490
MOM?

742
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,270
I JUST DID
YOU AND MOM'S ROOM.
WE ALREADY DID MY ROOM.

743
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:29,140
GOOD. I DID
THE OTHER SIDE.

744
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:30,390
LET'S CHECK
ON YOUR MOTHER--

745
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:31,640
( Lucy shrieks )

746
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:32,890
LUCY.

747
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:34,770
( Lucy shrieks )

748
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,780
MOMMY!

749
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,640
OH, NO!

750
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,150
LUCY!

751
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:42,030
HELP!

752
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,030
I'LL GET HER.

753
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:49,660
TINA! TINA!

754
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:52,660
OH!

755
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:53,910
Karen:
BABY!

756
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:55,790
OH, LOOK
AT ALL THE STINGS!

757
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:57,660
MORE THAN FIVE
OR SIX STINGS

758
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,550
ON A CHILD
LUCY'S SIZE...

759
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:02,050
( gasping )

760
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:04,550
THE... THE SHOTS,
THE BEE STUFF.

761
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:05,800
UPSTAIRS.

762
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:15,180
Chad:
HOLD ON, HONEY.

763
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,070
MOM'S GETTING
YOUR MEDICINE.

764
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:19,180
COME ON.

765
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,440
( moaning )

766
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,690
HANG IN THERE, SWEET PEA.

767
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:22,940
HANG IN THERE.

768
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:24,690
MOVE, MOVE,
MOVE, MOVE.

769
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:28,580
( wheezing )

770
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,700
( wheezing continues )

771
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,960
COME ON.

772
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,340
( wheezing subsides )

773
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:48,510
( both sighing )

774
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:52,270
NO. JUST LET HER REST.

775
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:55,770
WHO'S COMING?

776
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:57,640
- NO ONE.
- WHAT?!

777
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,270
THE PHONE'S DEAD.

778
00:54:58,270 --> 00:55:00,780
GREAT. IF THEY'RE
COVERING THE HOUSE

779
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,900
THEY COULD HAVE GOTTEN
IN THE EQUIPMENT

780
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,150
AND GUMMED IT UP.

781
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:07,650
CAN THEY BE COVERING
THE WHOLE HOUSE?

782
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:08,900
THEY'RE DOING THAT.

783
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,790
OH, MY GOD.
YOU'VE BEEN STUNG TOO?

784
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:13,290
THIS IS REALLY
TOTALLY NUTS.

785
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:15,160
LISTEN, THEY'RE
NOT MAN-EATERS.

786
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,410
THEY'RE JUST BEES.

787
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:18,910
SOMETHING DISTURBED
THEM, THAT'S ALL.

788
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:21,410
PRETTY SOON
THEY'LL GET BORED

789
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:22,050
AND THEY'LL GO AWAY.

790
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:25,170
CAN YOU GET THEM
TO PUT THAT IN WRITING?

791
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:27,590
( Lucy wheezing )

792
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:31,420
- OH, GOD.
- STAY HERE.

793
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:32,670
WHY? WHERE ARE YOU...?

794
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:35,430
Tracy:
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID
TO MY SISTER?!

795
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:37,310
YOU SHOT AT THEIR HIVES,
YOU IDIOT!

796
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:38,560
ARE YOU TOTALLY BRAIN-DEAD?!

797
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:42,320
DID YOU SEE WHAT THEY DID
TO MY SISTER IN THERE?!

798
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,570
SHH! SHE SEEMS
TO BE FINE NOW.

799
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:47,320
THEY'RE GOING TO GO AWAY,
AREN'T THEY, DADDY?

800
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,570
SURE THEY ARE, HONEY,

801
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:50,440
BUT WE'RE NOT WAITING
AROUND FOR THAT.

802
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,580
IT'S HARD TO TELL.

803
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,950
Chad:
THEY MAY BE JUST
CLINGING TO THE WALLS.

804
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:01,450
IF WE CAN JUST GET
PAST THE HOUSE,

805
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:03,340
MAYBE WE CAN SLIP INTO MY JEEP.

806
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:05,210
DAD...

807
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:08,090
I'M JUST GOING TO SEE
HOW BAD IT REALLY IS.

808
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:11,210
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK,
THEN WE CAN ALL GO.

809
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:30,730
( gasps )

810
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:32,370
OH.

811
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:33,620
CHAD!

812
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:34,870
CHAD!

813
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:39,240
( wheezing )

814
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:49,250
WE ONLY HAD TWO SHOTS.

815
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:53,640
THAT WAS THE LAST ONE.

816
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,260
( wheezing )

817
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:00,980
IF SHE NEEDS MORE, I...

818
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:03,480
I'VE GOT TO GET HER
TO A DOCTOR.

819
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:06,740
DAD, COME ON. HOW?

820
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,600
YOU CAN'T GO OUTSIDE.

821
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,110
( sighing )

822
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:14,080
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO.

823
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,090
( wheezing )

824
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,960
JUST HANG IN THERE, PUMPKIN.

825
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,720
MOMMY AND DADDY ARE GOING
TO MAKE IT BETTER.

826
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,600
I'LL GET HER
TO THE HOSPITAL,

827
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,470
AND THEN GO TO
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT

828
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:01,610
AND COME BACK
FOR THE REST OF YOU.

829
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:02,220
- MORE SOCKS.
- GREAT.

830
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,730
RUBBER BOOTS,
WORK GLOVES
AND DUCT TAPE.

831
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:06,230
WHAT PAIR
DO YOU WANT?

832
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:07,950
Chad:
UH, UH...

833
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:09,230
THE LEATHER ONES.

834
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:11,120
I HAVE TO MOVE
MY FINGERS.

835
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,240
YOU NEED SOMETHING
TO COVER YOUR FACE.

836
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,740
CHEESECLOTH.
UTILITY DRAWER.

837
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:20,380
THESE ARE WAY TOO THIN.

838
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:23,250
MY PARKA WITH THE HOOD.

839
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,250
IN THE ATTIC WITH
OUR WINTER CLOTHES.

840
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:26,500
RIGHT.

841
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,500
( gasping and coughing )

842
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,750
OH, GOD.

843
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:31,000
OH, GOD.

844
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:37,090
( gasping )

845
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:55,430
( gasping )

846
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,630
OH MY GOD.

847
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,620
SHE'LL NEVER MAKE IT
TO THE HOSPITAL.

848
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:25,810
SHE NEEDS A SHOT NOW.

849
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:29,530
THE SHACK
IN THE ORCHARD--

850
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:31,360
I PUT SOME KITS OUT THERE
FOR THE GUYS.

851
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,870
I CAN BE BACK IN LESS
THAN TWO MINUTES.

852
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,480
DAD? DAD?

853
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,740
THEY'RE IN THE ATTIC.

854
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:37,990
WHAT?

855
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:39,240
SEAL IT OFF.

856
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,490
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.

857
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:42,370
ANY WAY YOU CAN,
SEAL IT OFF.

858
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,490
TRACY, THE CHEESECLOTH.

859
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:45,740
TOM.

860
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:47,000
COME HERE.

861
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,630
WHAT?

862
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:49,500
THE BEES ARE
IN THE ATTIC.

863
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:52,000
IF THE BEES ARE
IN THE ATTIC,

864
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,140
THEY CAN GET DOWN
INTO THE WALLS,

865
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,010
AND ONCE THEY'RE
IN THE WALLS

866
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:00,760
THAT MEANS THEY'RE IN
THE HOUSE-- ALL OF IT,

867
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:03,900
AND WE'VE GOT
TO STOP THEM NOW.

868
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,400
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
YOUR FOLKS, MAN?

869
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,270
I MEAN,
SHOULDN'T THEY KNOW?

870
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:12,020
THEY'RE A LITTLE
BIT BUSY RIGHT NOW.

871
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:12,650
COME ON.

872
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,520
( wheezing )

873
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,770
OKAY. OKAY,
THAT'S FINE.

874
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:18,910
NOW STAY BACK
FROM THE DOOR, OKAY?

875
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:20,160
CHAD!

876
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,410
WHAT?

877
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:23,280
YOUR CAR KEYS.

878
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,170
( gasping )

879
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,950
IT'S THE ADAPTOR I USED
TO FILL MY WATERBED.

880
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:58,070
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
WITH ALL THIS STUFF?

881
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:00,070
JUST DO IT,
OKAY?

882
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:01,950
WHAT'S HE DOING, HONEY?

883
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:07,960
HE MADE IT.

884
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,210
HE'S IN THE JEEP.

885
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:15,970
( starter motor cranking )

886
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:17,720
COME ON!

887
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:22,340
( starter cranking )

888
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:24,230
OH, MY GOD.

889
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:25,480
IT WON'T START.

890
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:37,990
COME ON!

891
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:45,910
- YOU READY?
- YEAH.

892
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:49,030
WHATEVER YOU DO,
JUST KEEP FEEDING
ME THE HOSE.

893
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:50,290
I GOT YOU.

894
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:54,670
ALL RIGHT.

895
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,700
( alarm beeping )

896
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:32,660
COME ON!

897
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:34,160
COME ON!

898
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:42,000
( beeping )

899
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:17,290
TOM, GIVE ME SOME MORE HOSE!

900
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,680
MORE HOSE!

901
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,550
TOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

902
01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:30,440
I NEED MORE HOSE!

903
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,300
YEAH!

904
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:46,070
( engine revving )

905
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:48,950
IT STARTED.

906
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:52,820
TOM, WHAT IS THE
MATTER WITH YOU?

907
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:54,710
COME ON!

908
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:09,840
KEVIN?

909
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,730
KEVIN?

910
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:19,480
KEEP AN EYE ON HER.

911
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,350
I HAVE TO FIND OUT
WHAT THAT WAS.

912
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:25,110
MOM? I THINK SHE STOPPED
BREATHING COMPLETELY.

913
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:28,990
LUCY..?

914
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:30,240
LUCY.

915
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,450
OPEN THE DOOR!

916
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:05,730
SOMEBODY LET ME OUT!

917
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:10,740
( pounding )

918
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:13,690
SOMEBODY!

919
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:15,490
HELP ME!

920
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:16,740
MAKE HER
BREATHE, MOM!

921
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:18,630
COME ON!

922
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:20,500
PLEASE!

923
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:03,120
GOD, MOM...
SHE'S NOT BREATHING.

924
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:10,880
SHE'S STILL NOT BREATHING.

925
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:14,250
YOUR FATHER'S COMING.

926
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:16,130
HE'S COMING.

927
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,890
OH, GOD...

928
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:23,760
THEY'RE GETTING IN.

929
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,140
THEY'RE COMING THROUGH THE VENT.

930
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:27,010
THEY'RE INSIDE THE HOUSE!

931
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:28,900
FIND SOMETHING AND BLOCK THEM.

932
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:32,650
TRACY!

933
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:56,290
( horn honking )

934
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:57,680
HE'S HERE!

935
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,540
HE'S HERE!

936
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:13,560
CHAD, HURRY!

937
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:19,200
COME ON.

938
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,700
DO IT. DO IT!

939
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:30,320
COME ON, BABY.

940
01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:32,830
GIVE HER THE OTHER ONE.

941
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,980
Chad:
COME ON, SWEET PEA.

942
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:50,230
LUCY, LISTEN TO MOMMY.

943
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:53,350
YOU'VE GOT TO BREATHE
FOR US, BABY.

944
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:54,600
WE'VE DONE ALL WE CAN.

945
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,730
IT'S UP TO YOU NOW, BABY.

946
01:07:56,730 --> 01:07:58,440
IF YOU WANT
TO KNOW

947
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:02,190
ALL OF LIFE...

948
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:04,080
GROWING UP...

949
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,330
LOVE,

950
01:08:05,330 --> 01:08:09,000
A BEAUTIFUL
LITTLE GIRL

951
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,750
THEN YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO BREATHE, BABY.

952
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:14,250
BREATHE.

953
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:15,500
( gasping )

954
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,370
OH! OH! OH!

955
01:08:17,370 --> 01:08:19,880
( sobbing )

956
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:29,890
THEY'RE INSIDE THE HOUSE.

957
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,530
WHERE ARE THE BOYS?

958
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:38,780
WHERE'S KEVIN?

959
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:40,030
I DON'T KNOW.

960
01:08:40,030 --> 01:08:41,900
I GUESS UPSTAIRS.

961
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:43,780
( sighs )

962
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:47,540
HIYA, SWEET PEA.

963
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:48,790
HOW YOU DOING?

964
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:50,660
MY ARM ITCHES.

965
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:51,910
OH.

966
01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:55,660
WE'RE GOING TO FIX THAT
REAL SOON, OKAY?

967
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:57,550
OKAY.

968
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:01,920
WE'VE GOT TO GET EVERYBODY
DOWN INTO THE CELLAR.

969
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:10,560
KEVIN!

970
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:12,430
TOM!

971
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:15,310
( distant sobbing )

972
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:24,520
Chad:
WHERE ARE YOU?

973
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:35,530
TOM... WHERE'S KEVIN?

974
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,790
TOM?!

975
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:41,920
HE WAS...

976
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,790
UP IN THE ATTIC...

977
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,290
THEN THERE WERE...

978
01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:48,930
MILLIONS OF... BEES THERE.

979
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:51,380
THERE WAS
LOTS OF THEM.

980
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:54,520
AND, MR. INGRAM, I...

981
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,640
I HEARD A... A CRASH

982
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:57,890
SO I...

983
01:09:57,890 --> 01:09:59,140
I'M SORRY.

984
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:02,890
MR. INGRAM, I DON'T WANT
ANY OF US TO DIE.

985
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:05,400
TOM...

986
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:08,480
NONE OF US IS GOING TO DIE.

987
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:09,120
HERE.

988
01:10:09,730 --> 01:10:11,620
HERE.

989
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:17,880
EVERYONE IS DOWN
IN THE CELLAR.

990
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,130
GO ON DOWN THERE.

991
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:21,630
I'LL GET KEVIN
AND FOLLOW YOU.

992
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:23,500
GO ON DOWN THERE.

993
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:32,890
KEVIN?!

994
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:37,150
KEVIN?!

995
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:57,530
KEVIN!

996
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:02,540
KEVIN!

997
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,920
KEVIN!

998
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,050
( coughing )

999
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:21,940
I WAS IN THE ATTIC.

1000
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:23,190
I KNOW.

1001
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:25,060
COME ON, LET'S GO.

1002
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:30,060
COME ON! GO! GO! GO!

1003
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:39,320
NOT TOO MUCH
TOO FAST, HONEY.

1004
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:51,840
WHERE THE HELL
DID YOU DISAPPEAR TO?!

1005
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:58,730
HOW YOU DOING, DARLING?

1006
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:00,600
I'M OKAY, DADDY.

1007
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:06,350
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

1008
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:06,980
I'M FINE.

1009
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:09,490
JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE.

1010
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:10,740
OH, GOD, CHAD.

1011
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:12,610
HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE YOU BEEN STUNG?

1012
01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:14,490
THERE MUST BE 60 STINGS.

1013
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:17,000
( Lucy screaming )

1014
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:22,620
Tracy:
OH, MY GOD. DAD!

1015
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:23,870
Kevin:
IF THEY'RE COMING IN

1016
01:12:23,870 --> 01:12:26,370
THROUGH THERE, THEY'RE
IN THE KITCHEN NOW.

1017
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:28,260
THEY'RE INSIDE
THE WHOLE HOUSE.

1018
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:30,630
THE KITCHEN IS
OUR ONLY WAY OUT OF HERE.

1019
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:32,510
THERE AREN'T ANY OTHER DOORS.

1020
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:35,630
WE'VE GOT TO KEEP THEM OUT.

1021
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,580
Karen:
THE WINE ALCOVE.

1022
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:42,220
JOHN TOLD US THAT
THE TUNNEL BEHIND IT--

1023
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:44,110
IT LEADS TO THE BARN.

1024
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:14,340
DO YOU THINK
IT CAN WORK?

1025
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:16,470
SMOKE PACIFIES THEM.

1026
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,090
A MATCH.

1027
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:20,840
I NEED A MATCH.

1028
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,730
MR. INGRAM.

1029
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:26,980
YOU SMOKE?

1030
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:37,610
( coughing )

1031
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:38,860
IT'S TOO HEAVY.

1032
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:40,110
THE SMOKE'S TOO HEAVY.

1033
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:42,610
WE'LL ALL SUFFOCATE.

1034
01:13:47,870 --> 01:13:49,750
EVERYBODY GET IN THE TUNNEL.

1035
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:56,510
( crackling )

1036
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:02,270
MOM, WHY ARE THE LIGHTS
FLICKERING LIKE THAT?

1037
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:03,520
IT'S LIKE WITH THE PHONE.

1038
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,140
THEY MUST BE
AFFECTING THE WIRING.

1039
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:08,640
OKAY. OKAY.

1040
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:21,540
OKAY.

1041
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,290
OKAY.

1042
01:14:25,290 --> 01:14:27,790
I'LL BE RIGHT
BEHIND YOU.

1043
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:29,040
IT'S OKAY.

1044
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:36,300
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
COME ON. WE'VE GOT TO GO.

1045
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:38,170
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

1046
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:41,310
I'VE GOT TO KEEP THOSE
THINGS OFF YOU GUYS.

1047
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:44,810
OKAY. OKAY, I'LL
STAY HERE AND HELP YOU.

1048
01:14:44,810 --> 01:14:47,310
Chad:
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
ENOUGH ALREADY.

1049
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:49,180
LET ME HELP.

1050
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:56,570
OKAY, TOM.

1051
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,270
LET'S DO IT.

1052
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:35,340
MOM, ARE WE SURE

1053
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:36,590
THIS LEADS
TO THE BARN?

1054
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:40,980
YES. WE ARE.

1055
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:42,850
WE JUST HAVE
TO KEEP MOVING.

1056
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:45,990
( coughing )

1057
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:47,240
WHERE'S YOUR FATHER?

1058
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:49,110
HE STAYED BEHIND.

1059
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:51,110
HE AND TOM ARE
GOING TO TRY

1060
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:52,360
TO KEEP THEM
OFF OF US.

1061
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,240
KEEP MOVING.
JUST KEEP MOVING.

1062
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:09,510
OKAY.

1063
01:16:09,510 --> 01:16:10,130
OKAY, TOM.

1064
01:16:10,130 --> 01:16:13,260
THROUGH THE...
THROUGH THE TUNNEL.

1065
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:15,880
GET IN THE BARN
WITH EVERYBODY ELSE.

1066
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,390
( panting )

1067
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:21,270
( gasping )

1068
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:27,900
TOM, I TOLD YOU
TO GET IN THE TUNNEL.

1069
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:31,900
MR. INGRAM, I
CAUSED ALL THIS.

1070
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:34,290
I SHOT UP THEIR HIVES

1071
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:35,650
AND I SHOULD BE THE ONE
WHO GOES UPSTAIRS.

1072
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:45,910
IF I KNEW YOU SMOKED

1073
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:49,050
I WOULDN'T LET KEVIN
HANG OUT WITH YOU.

1074
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:58,930
GO ON, NOW.

1075
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:11,190
THANKS.

1076
01:17:11,190 --> 01:17:12,940
GO ON.

1077
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:14,830
GET IN THE TUNNEL.

1078
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:17,330
( wheezing )

1079
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:49,980
( coughing )

1080
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:51,860
OW!

1081
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:53,730
( grunts )

1082
01:17:53,730 --> 01:17:56,230
MOM, HOW MUCH
FURTHER IS IT?

1083
01:17:56,230 --> 01:17:58,740
I DON'T KNOW, SWEETHEART.

1084
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:02,120
WE JUST GOT TO KEEP MOVING.

1085
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:05,740
( gasping and coughing )

1086
01:18:10,130 --> 01:18:13,880
MOMMY, I DON'T WANT
TO BE STUNG ANYMORE.

1087
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:17,640
I KNOW, BABY, I KNOW.

1088
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:20,640
( gasps )

1089
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:25,900
WHERE THE HELL
IS MY DAD?

1090
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:29,400
HE'S... HE'S STILL BACK THERE.

1091
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:30,650
( gasping )

1092
01:18:30,650 --> 01:18:34,410
LET'S JUST KEEP GOING,
EVERYBODY.

1093
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:36,160
COME ON, BABY.

1094
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,680
( grunts )

1095
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:36,670
THEY'RE COMING IN HERE.

1096
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:42,170
OPEN IT!

1097
01:19:56,270 --> 01:19:58,770
OPEN IT!

1098
01:19:58,770 --> 01:20:00,020
YEAH, MOM!

1099
01:20:02,530 --> 01:20:04,280
( gasping and groaning )

1100
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:12,040
( yelling )

1101
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:15,170
WE'VE GOT TO GO BACK.

1102
01:20:15,170 --> 01:20:17,040
WE CAN'T!

1103
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:21,430
Lucy:
MOMMY!

1104
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:23,930
STAY AWAY FROM MY LITTLE GIRL!

1105
01:20:23,930 --> 01:20:25,180
STAY AWAY!

1106
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:25,800
COME HERE, BABY.

1107
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,940
Tracy:
WHAT ARE WE GOING
TO DO NOW?

1108
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:34,440
HOLD STILL, HONEY,
STAY REAL STILL.

1109
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,070
( crashing )

1110
01:20:48,070 --> 01:20:49,320
( screaming )

1111
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,210
Chad:
HOLD ON!

1112
01:20:54,210 --> 01:20:56,050
HOLD ON!
I'M COMING!

1113
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:57,660
I'M COMING.

1114
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:25,330
WE NEED TO BLOCK THIS.

1115
01:21:42,710 --> 01:21:45,210
ARE WE SAFE
IN HERE, DADDY?

1116
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:47,720
YEAH.
WE'RE SAFE NOW.

1117
01:21:47,710 --> 01:21:48,970
NOW WE'RE SAFE.

1118
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:51,920
THE SMOKE IS WORKING.

1119
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:55,390
IT'S WORKING.

1120
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:14,740
THANKS, DADDY.
