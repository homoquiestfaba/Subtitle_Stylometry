2
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:44,556
Don't be stupid.

3
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:46,835
Brother, can you give me-

4
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:50,395
Go to sleep.

5
00:02:17,675 --> 00:02:19,076
Thanks a lot bro.

6
00:02:19,116 --> 00:02:20,995
Of course bro, anytime.

7
00:02:22,315 --> 00:02:24,635
Glad you told me you needed bonzai.

8
00:02:26,155 --> 00:02:28,556
I get scared of smoking this shit alone.

9
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:36,516
Did you put plenty?

10
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:37,596
I did, bro.

11
00:02:40,796 --> 00:02:42,515
Don't worry, I won't tell Yunus.

12
00:02:42,556 --> 00:02:43,835
Thanks.

13
00:03:08,395 --> 00:03:11,476
You can go on.

14
00:04:12,355 --> 00:04:18,635
When I'm Done Dying

15
00:04:32,595 --> 00:04:33,755
Yunus!

16
00:04:39,915 --> 00:04:41,035
What happened?

17
00:04:41,076 --> 00:04:43,355
A drunkard messed with me.

18
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:50,516
Is it gonna need stitches?

19
00:04:50,995 --> 00:04:53,156
It should be fine.

20
00:04:56,635 --> 00:05:00,715
I wish I didn't go out tonight. Couldn't sleep.

21
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:12,235
Did you lock the door?

22
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,875
I'm uploading this?

23
00:05:17,915 --> 00:05:20,596
Yep. Say, new song is on the way.

24
00:05:21,556 --> 00:05:23,196
Coming soon.

25
00:05:23,235 --> 00:05:27,875
New... song... is on the way.

26
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:33,036
'You guys are on fire',
'You are great'

27
00:05:34,676 --> 00:05:36,196
U guys rappers or models?

28
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,115
We want new songs not pictures.

29
00:05:39,995 --> 00:05:42,995
My ass. Like he does
any shit himself.

30
00:05:45,075 --> 00:05:47,876
We gotta save up for the studio man.

31
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:50,835
Spend less money, eat less.

32
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:56,995
Let's upload the song as is. I think it's dope.

33
00:05:58,235 --> 00:06:01,675
We can remix later when we make the album.

34
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:09,915
I'm left in the dark, no light on the streets

35
00:06:09,956 --> 00:06:12,475
My mind is restless, in the claws of the night

36
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:17,395
Wasn't easy to survive in this hood, but it defined me

37
00:06:17,435 --> 00:06:20,396
I could have lived an ordinary life and chilled

38
00:06:20,435 --> 00:06:23,355
But I woke up to nightmares all the time

39
00:06:23,396 --> 00:06:25,755
Kids poisoned  themselves on holiday mornings

40
00:06:25,795 --> 00:06:28,196
They collected bonzai instead of sweets

41
00:06:28,235 --> 00:06:30,516
Take, take, take one more inhale

42
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:32,755
It's up to you who you become tomorrow

43
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:35,515
Hold on to words or you'll fall into the abyss

44
00:06:35,555 --> 00:06:38,675
If you burn with me here you'll get to like hell

45
00:06:58,516 --> 00:06:59,476
Hey.

46
00:07:00,595 --> 00:07:01,236
Hey.

47
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:02,235
I'm Fehmi.

48
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,435
Devin.

49
00:07:06,316 --> 00:07:09,196
I can take these.

50
00:07:09,435 --> 00:07:11,475
You don't bother at all, I got it.

51
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,635
No, it's ok.

52
00:07:17,156 --> 00:07:20,156
Is it your first time around here?

53
00:07:25,035 --> 00:07:26,795
This way.

54
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:39,236
Your friend is donating these books
for nothing. Our kiddos are no nerds.

55
00:07:40,115 --> 00:07:42,236
She's so stubborn. I couldn't say no.

56
00:07:43,356 --> 00:07:45,836
You tired?

57
00:07:47,395 --> 00:07:48,875
Nope.

58
00:07:57,555 --> 00:07:59,796
Islam is the right path.

59
00:08:07,435 --> 00:08:08,596
My boys.

60
00:08:11,356 --> 00:08:13,275
Fehmi brother, who is she?

61
00:08:13,315 --> 00:08:14,795
What's cooking?

62
00:08:15,476 --> 00:08:19,355
She brought books to your sister.
Efe, you guys take these home.

63
00:08:19,914 --> 00:08:21,356
Come on get going.

64
00:08:25,235 --> 00:08:26,915
Do you want to stick around a bit?

65
00:08:26,956 --> 00:08:28,916
I'll introduce you to my band-mate.

66
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:34,035
When we become famous,
you'll have a story to brag.

67
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:41,555
Bro, it looks amazing.
Yeah?

68
00:08:41,595 --> 00:08:43,556
Go over, I'll take a photo.

69
00:08:49,316 --> 00:08:50,956
Yo, isn't it great?

70
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:56,635
We should get a nice photo in front of it.

71
00:08:56,675 --> 00:08:59,395
Good work, bro!

72
00:08:59,435 --> 00:09:00,876
Listen to this!

73
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,675
If Tupac knew my rhymes are so mind-blowing,
he'd get up from his grave and come running.

74
00:09:03,716 --> 00:09:06,356
He'd cut my tongue with hurry,
a rival like me would give him mad worry.

75
00:09:06,835 --> 00:09:08,355
You call yourself a rapper?

76
00:09:08,676 --> 00:09:10,835
Man, he thinks he's as good as Tupac.

77
00:09:11,475 --> 00:09:16,356
Is it true, that his band mates
smoked his ashes with weed?

78
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,635
Wow, you know.

79
00:09:18,676 --> 00:09:22,755
Imagine the lyrics you can write with a Tupac high!

80
00:09:23,035 --> 00:09:26,315
Don't talk like that. Allah will strike us!

81
00:09:26,356 --> 00:09:29,516
Look at the guy, he's struck by Allah already.

82
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,115
Hi.

83
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:33,476
We didn't get to meet. I'm Alper.

84
00:09:33,516 --> 00:09:34,756
Devin.

85
00:09:35,156 --> 00:09:36,356
Fist bump, fist bump!

86
00:09:36,396 --> 00:09:37,675
Are you from around here?

87
00:09:37,996 --> 00:09:39,595
She's my guest.

88
00:09:39,915 --> 00:09:41,835
You here to make a documentary?

89
00:09:41,876 --> 00:09:42,956
No.

90
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,556
So, what do you do?

91
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:49,676
I make music too. I mean, I used to.

92
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:50,636
Really?

93
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:52,156
What kind of music?

94
00:09:52,195 --> 00:09:53,315
Electronic.

95
00:09:53,355 --> 00:09:53,995
Interesting.

96
00:09:54,035 --> 00:09:55,275
Play something for us.

97
00:09:55,316 --> 00:09:56,475
What have you got?

98
00:09:57,995 --> 00:09:59,755
Come on, come on, come on.

99
00:10:01,995 --> 00:10:03,116
Something jolly.

100
00:10:03,155 --> 00:10:05,596
Something jolly...

101
00:10:13,995 --> 00:10:15,515
Nice intro.

102
00:10:15,955 --> 00:10:17,075
Cool.

103
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,555
It's like a rap beat.

104
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:22,355
-You could rap over this.
-Yeah.

105
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:25,196
I don't sing for free normally.

106
00:10:25,995 --> 00:10:27,116
Welcome to my hood

107
00:10:27,155 --> 00:10:28,356
This is Karaçınar

108
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,635
Never miss a beat,
this is Fehmi indeed

109
00:10:30,676 --> 00:10:32,995
I have no fancy clothes,
all I got is dirt and rust

110
00:10:33,036 --> 00:10:35,555
Rap is my destiny,
it will be my legacy

111
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:38,035
Don't drift, open your eyes wide

112
00:10:38,076 --> 00:10:40,276
Not the dreams but the truth is Karaçınar

113
00:10:40,316 --> 00:10:42,916
Our streets lead to nowhere,
dreams are locked up

114
00:10:42,955 --> 00:10:44,796
On a short leash, it's hard to get far

115
00:10:44,836 --> 00:10:48,075
But I got the flow I'm ill,
Just sit back and chill

116
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,715
Hip-hop is a tough pursuit
but easy is not my way

117
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,195
The day will come when I'll
tour these streets with my own car

118
00:10:58,236 --> 00:11:00,355
The blood in my veins runs wild

119
00:11:00,395 --> 00:11:03,076
Homie, here I can make you suffer

120
00:11:03,115 --> 00:11:07,235
All I got is the pen in my hand,
I write for the world to understand

121
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:09,715
This is Karaçınar,
this is my family

122
00:11:09,755 --> 00:11:13,595
If you can't deal with it,
just go eat my treat

123
00:11:14,436 --> 00:11:17,355
Cheers!

124
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:21,716
Wait, that wasn't good.
One more time.

125
00:11:21,955 --> 00:11:23,155
Ready?

126
00:11:23,195 --> 00:11:26,075
Three, two, one!

127
00:11:26,835 --> 00:11:28,515
Nice.

128
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:31,235
I don't mind the bad review.

129
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:33,755
I just don't want my music
to be mislabeled as avant garde.

130
00:11:33,796 --> 00:11:36,075
Who cares, you're featured on ravermag.

131
00:11:36,516 --> 00:11:38,156
Whatever.

132
00:12:08,196 --> 00:12:11,435
Devin, can I borrow your midi controller?
Mine is in repair.

133
00:12:14,555 --> 00:12:17,315
You're not using it anyway, right?

134
00:12:19,435 --> 00:12:21,116
Sorry, I can't.

135
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,875
But the consonant sounds won't have
the same effect in a different country.

136
00:12:29,675 --> 00:12:30,996
True.

137
00:12:31,035 --> 00:12:32,636
Can't believe I didn't think of this before.

138
00:12:32,675 --> 00:12:34,915
I think you've spent too much time on this project.

139
00:12:35,475 --> 00:12:38,916
Try and get clean,
aren't you done dying

140
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:40,996
This will last till the end...

141
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,476
We started a fire.

142
00:12:43,515 --> 00:12:44,795
I started.

143
00:12:45,835 --> 00:12:50,835
This will last till the end.
I started a fire.

144
00:12:50,876 --> 00:12:53,115
I started a fire!

145
00:12:54,276 --> 00:12:55,556
On fire!

146
00:12:55,915 --> 00:12:58,676
The song is gonna be like a snake(great)!

147
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:03,715
It's gonna be a kickass song.

148
00:13:03,756 --> 00:13:05,475
Let's finish the chorus.

149
00:13:05,515 --> 00:13:08,836
We can shoot a music video in front of fire barrells.

150
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:11,156
Excuse me.

151
00:13:16,116 --> 00:13:18,275
Sorry to keep you waiting.

152
00:13:27,155 --> 00:13:28,555
Bon apetit.

153
00:13:30,955 --> 00:13:32,475
What are you laughing at?

154
00:13:42,795 --> 00:13:45,476
We want to thank Ramo brother for this opportunity.

155
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:47,116
Are y'all ready?

156
00:13:47,155 --> 00:13:48,435
Yes!

157
00:13:48,476 --> 00:13:49,635
I can't hear you!

158
00:13:49,675 --> 00:13:50,836
Yes!

159
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,275
Alright then let's begin.

160
00:13:53,595 --> 00:13:57,075
We ripped off this beat from DP,
I hope he'll forgive us.

161
00:14:01,396 --> 00:14:03,075
Fell asleep on the counter

162
00:14:03,115 --> 00:14:04,595
Cops in front of the shop

163
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,275
Kids get high on glue

164
00:14:06,316 --> 00:14:07,796
Come on chief we are guilty

165
00:14:07,836 --> 00:14:09,275
Bonzai in the playground

166
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:10,795
It's free and it's plenty

167
00:14:10,836 --> 00:14:14,235
When the death trip comes,
it makes everything seem freaky

168
00:14:14,276 --> 00:14:18,116
Evil twines your dreams,
everyone clenches teeth

169
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:21,556
They holler from all corners,
under the infulence of many things

170
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:23,075
My wallet is empty but my mind is full

171
00:14:23,115 --> 00:14:24,755
I can find the way without a penny

172
00:14:24,795 --> 00:14:28,035
If you point us it will cost you an arm,
in my hood all roads lead to harm

173
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,555
Prison bars are destiny

174
00:14:29,595 --> 00:14:31,355
Hunger is the enemy

175
00:14:31,396 --> 00:14:34,235
All eyes are fixed on us,
they see us as junkies

176
00:14:34,276 --> 00:14:37,635
When the future unravels,
maybe eyes will fill with tears

177
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:40,795
My life is on a thin thread,
maybe it's gonna break apart

178
00:14:40,835 --> 00:14:44,196
Believe, it will be right,
everything will be alright

179
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:47,835
Against odds, despite fate, everything will be alright

180
00:14:47,876 --> 00:14:49,755
Believe, believe, believe, believe

181
00:14:49,796 --> 00:14:51,115
Everything will be alright

182
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:54,355
Against odds, despite fate, everything will be alright

183
00:14:57,715 --> 00:14:59,956
Thank you!

184
00:15:05,395 --> 00:15:07,595
Your hands are so small.

185
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,995
Look at mine.

186
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:19,475
Mine is the size of your face.

187
00:15:53,436 --> 00:15:55,395
I need to go.

188
00:15:56,476 --> 00:16:00,355
You can stay, until the morning.

189
00:16:02,356 --> 00:16:04,075
I have to go to work.

190
00:16:04,436 --> 00:16:06,515
They are waiting for me.

191
00:16:08,236 --> 00:16:09,435
At this hour?

192
00:16:09,476 --> 00:16:10,836
Interesting.

193
00:16:10,876 --> 00:16:12,435
You don't believe me?

194
00:16:14,396 --> 00:16:15,755
Nope.

195
00:16:17,036 --> 00:16:18,516
For real.

196
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:22,356
Don't worry, there is no other
chick(chicken) waiting for me.

197
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:23,995
Chicken?

198
00:16:24,036 --> 00:16:25,755
Just joking around.

199
00:16:25,995 --> 00:16:27,394
Chicken.

200
00:16:29,475 --> 00:16:30,834
Ok then.

201
00:16:33,195 --> 00:16:35,195
Is this your place?

202
00:16:36,675 --> 00:16:39,035
It was my Grandpa's.

203
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:42,516
Does it look good on me?

204
00:16:46,995 --> 00:16:49,276
What about your parents?

205
00:16:50,035 --> 00:16:53,396
What about your parents?

206
00:16:54,435 --> 00:16:56,475
That's not why I asked.

207
00:16:57,876 --> 00:17:00,035
Weren't you running late?

208
00:17:00,356 --> 00:17:01,435
Yes.

209
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,355
Do you mind giving me some cab money?

210
00:17:12,955 --> 00:17:14,595
Sure.

211
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,035
Would that be enough?

212
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:26,635
Yes.

213
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:28,476
Thanks.

214
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:52,875
The best brother of all brothers!

215
00:17:55,155 --> 00:17:57,115
Where have you been?

216
00:17:57,156 --> 00:17:59,115
I have to wake up at 8 am.

217
00:17:59,155 --> 00:18:01,796
Sorry bro. The concert started late.

218
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:05,396
It's over. I'm done covering for you.

219
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,915
Don't care if you get fired.
Can't work 20 hours a day.

220
00:18:09,395 --> 00:18:11,276
Come on bro, give me some credit.

221
00:18:11,315 --> 00:18:15,276
I'm not fooling around.
Rap is my job too.

222
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:19,715
Job huh? That's a hobby.
Do you make money rapping? No.

223
00:18:19,995 --> 00:18:22,035
Not yet maybe, but soon I will.

224
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:24,795
Yeah, yeah. Same story for two years.

225
00:18:24,835 --> 00:18:27,635
Wait. Give me your phone.

226
00:18:28,556 --> 00:18:30,636
Give it to me brother.

227
00:18:33,435 --> 00:18:36,035
We uploaded a new song last week.

228
00:18:36,835 --> 00:18:38,955
Seventeen thousand views.
In just a week.

229
00:18:40,715 --> 00:18:41,795
Wow.

230
00:18:41,835 --> 00:18:43,636
Pretty cool.

231
00:18:43,676 --> 00:18:45,475
Let me show you something too.

232
00:18:49,315 --> 00:18:51,476
What do you think?

233
00:18:52,675 --> 00:18:54,435
What's this bro?

234
00:18:54,476 --> 00:18:58,316
It has three million views.
That's how it works right?

235
00:18:58,675 --> 00:19:01,515
You are so annoying.

236
00:19:01,835 --> 00:19:04,275
Such a killjoy.

237
00:19:04,636 --> 00:19:08,076
I'm not annoying, just realistic. Got it?

238
00:19:11,595 --> 00:19:13,075
I'm taking off.

239
00:19:13,115 --> 00:19:15,715
Bro. You two are around a lot.

240
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:17,995
People are talking.

241
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:20,556
Be careful.

242
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,915
Are you worried about me or your charisma?

243
00:19:24,475 --> 00:19:26,955
Mind your own business.

244
00:19:42,476 --> 00:19:44,836
-How is it?
-Looks pretty good.

245
00:19:45,595 --> 00:19:46,876
Yeah.

246
00:19:48,835 --> 00:19:52,475
I did a minimal version,
but I'm working on it.

247
00:19:52,516 --> 00:19:56,435
Actaully I think it looks the same.

248
00:19:58,035 --> 00:19:59,875
He's coming by the way.

249
00:20:00,955 --> 00:20:02,916
Don't get me wrong but,

250
00:20:02,956 --> 00:20:05,475
if you want something just for fun...

251
00:20:05,516 --> 00:20:07,955
he might not handle that well.

252
00:20:08,515 --> 00:20:10,515
He's fragile.

253
00:20:11,195 --> 00:20:13,315
Okay, understood.

254
00:20:17,435 --> 00:20:18,556
What's up.

255
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:19,835
Hey there.

256
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:22,396
Birds told me you came here.

257
00:20:27,636 --> 00:20:28,996
Are you ready?

258
00:20:51,356 --> 00:20:53,436
So you like my spot?

259
00:21:02,115 --> 00:21:04,275
Thanks for the beers.

260
00:21:04,315 --> 00:21:06,036
Cheers.

261
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:24,556
Sometimes Yunus and I write lyrics here.

262
00:21:24,595 --> 00:21:26,835
It's an inspiring view.

263
00:21:27,755 --> 00:21:29,555
I totally agree.

264
00:21:47,395 --> 00:21:50,235
I love your smell.

265
00:21:52,755 --> 00:21:54,755
My perfume?

266
00:21:54,795 --> 00:21:59,315
No. I'm talking about you.
The smell of your skin.

267
00:22:01,836 --> 00:22:04,316
So will you come to Timur's concert?

268
00:22:04,355 --> 00:22:06,155
I don't know.

269
00:22:06,516 --> 00:22:08,195
Why don't you play?

270
00:22:13,636 --> 00:22:17,115
Fuck. What's wrong with him?

271
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,276
Ömer?

272
00:22:23,555 --> 00:22:25,795
You know him?

273
00:22:25,836 --> 00:22:26,755
Yeah.

274
00:22:26,796 --> 00:22:28,435
We should take him to the hospital.

275
00:22:28,476 --> 00:22:31,395
No, that'll get him in trouble.

276
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:34,115
-He's on bonzai.
-What if he dies here?

277
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:38,356
You go, I'll stay with him.

278
00:22:38,395 --> 00:22:42,756
Don't worry. He's been like
this before, he'll be alright.

279
00:22:42,996 --> 00:22:47,676
Don't you watch the news. People
die from this you know right?

280
00:22:47,956 --> 00:22:53,235
I promise to take him to the
hospital if he gets worse Okay?

281
00:23:26,835 --> 00:23:28,435
Bon apetit.

282
00:23:30,436 --> 00:23:33,715
I got it, you always put too much.

283
00:23:35,556 --> 00:23:37,795
That's enough for me.

284
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:39,715
That much only?

285
00:23:39,755 --> 00:23:42,276
You are a man, have some more.

286
00:23:42,315 --> 00:23:44,755
I'm good Pa, gotta watch the belly. Thanks.

287
00:23:44,795 --> 00:23:48,716
I had a chat with the new girl
at the grocery store today.

288
00:23:48,755 --> 00:23:50,155
I liked her a lot.

289
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:52,836
Yeah Dad, I know her too.

290
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,316
She's real sweet.

291
00:23:54,355 --> 00:23:55,996
Have you seen the girl Erdem?

292
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,835
Yes, I know her.

293
00:23:58,075 --> 00:24:01,355
Give me my phone back. Texting
at dinner like degenarate kids.

294
00:24:01,395 --> 00:24:02,676
You'll kill the battery.

295
00:24:02,716 --> 00:24:04,756
But it's very important.

296
00:24:04,795 --> 00:24:06,075
Allah alllah.

297
00:24:06,475 --> 00:24:07,675
Erdem.

298
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:10,155
Why don't you do the groceries tomorrow?

299
00:24:10,195 --> 00:24:14,835
Chat with her a little.
Maybe you'll like her?

300
00:24:15,075 --> 00:24:17,955
She's not my type.

301
00:24:20,155 --> 00:24:23,676
For years, you've been
finding excuses for everyone.

302
00:24:24,155 --> 00:24:26,515
All the girls in the hood adore you.

303
00:24:26,556 --> 00:24:29,355
Why can't you like girls?

304
00:24:31,115 --> 00:24:33,475
Thanks for dinner.

305
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:34,555
Give it to me.

306
00:24:34,595 --> 00:24:36,556
I need to send-

307
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,675
Son, don't be like your brother okay?

308
00:24:39,716 --> 00:24:42,476
God forbid, dad. I hope he won't be like me!

309
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:45,236
I work like a dog, day and night.

310
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:49,316
When this drunkard fools around,
I cover his shift, so they don't fire him.

311
00:24:49,356 --> 00:24:52,236
Because I'm a fool. I work
20 hours because I'm a fool.

312
00:24:52,275 --> 00:24:55,476
Please, don't ever be like me, ok?

313
00:26:52,835 --> 00:26:54,276
Fehmi.

314
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,516
Mr. handsome.

315
00:26:58,755 --> 00:27:01,035
Wake up, it's late.

316
00:27:03,835 --> 00:27:05,075
Come on.

317
00:27:10,275 --> 00:27:13,995
Get up. Come on.

318
00:27:19,276 --> 00:27:22,035
Come.

319
00:27:29,355 --> 00:27:31,555
We'll tell dad that you had too much to drink.

320
00:27:31,596 --> 00:27:34,835
I don't want to give him a stroke.

321
00:27:35,716 --> 00:27:37,795
You get your shit together.

322
00:27:37,835 --> 00:27:39,795
Okay.

323
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:42,156
You're going to find a day job.

324
00:27:42,195 --> 00:27:44,955
I want you home by my side at night.

325
00:27:45,716 --> 00:27:49,556
Aren't you hanging out with
Ali at night? What about that?

326
00:28:06,836 --> 00:28:09,075
Why did you ask for me so urgently?

327
00:28:09,115 --> 00:28:10,715
Open the top drawer.

328
00:28:11,236 --> 00:28:13,195
Open it.

329
00:28:15,675 --> 00:28:19,316
I marked all the job listings in red.

330
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,995
You'll call all those numbers today.

331
00:28:22,275 --> 00:28:23,675
No whining.

332
00:28:23,716 --> 00:28:25,796
I'll check the call history tonight.

333
00:28:25,835 --> 00:28:28,356
There are no minutes on the phone.

334
00:28:28,595 --> 00:28:30,316
Of course.

335
00:28:33,596 --> 00:28:34,875
It's my last money.

336
00:28:34,915 --> 00:28:37,195
Don't fritter it away.

337
00:28:37,235 --> 00:28:38,715
Ok brother.

338
00:29:26,475 --> 00:29:28,555
Dance a little.

339
00:29:55,155 --> 00:29:57,835
Is he hitting on you?

340
00:29:57,875 --> 00:29:59,115
What?

341
00:30:02,076 --> 00:30:03,635
What's going on between you two?

342
00:30:03,675 --> 00:30:06,036
He is smiling at you, you smile back.

343
00:30:06,075 --> 00:30:08,155
What do you want me to do?
Just give him a cold stare?

344
00:30:08,195 --> 00:30:10,556
I think you can keep a distance,
or he'll think you're flirting.

345
00:30:11,595 --> 00:30:13,675
Fehmi, we've been friends since middle school.

346
00:30:13,716 --> 00:30:15,756
What should I do? Not talk to him?

347
00:30:15,796 --> 00:30:19,155
Actually I'd prefer if you didn't  talk to other men.

348
00:30:20,876 --> 00:30:22,715
Don't get me wrong. It's not about you.

349
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,795
It's just that, men can't be trusted.

350
00:30:24,836 --> 00:30:27,395
What is that supposed to mean?

351
00:30:27,436 --> 00:30:29,715
You only need to trust me, not other men.

352
00:30:29,756 --> 00:30:32,236
I can manage if someone crosses the line.

353
00:30:38,276 --> 00:30:40,596
I am going back in. Are you coming?

354
00:30:40,915 --> 00:30:44,235
It's disrespectful to Timur.

355
00:30:45,915 --> 00:30:48,396
Okay, your call.

356
00:31:46,235 --> 00:31:49,756
Let's wait till it's over.

357
00:32:13,436 --> 00:32:15,796
Come, take a drag.

358
00:32:16,515 --> 00:32:19,076
One puff would do it for you.

359
00:32:19,636 --> 00:32:21,315
What are you doing?

360
00:32:21,355 --> 00:32:23,196
They don't want your weed bro.

361
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:27,196
We give them bonzai with Fehmi.

362
00:32:27,235 --> 00:32:29,155
Right Fehmi?

363
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:01,155
Are you okay?

364
00:33:07,835 --> 00:33:09,515
Are you smoking bonzai?

365
00:33:09,556 --> 00:33:11,115
No.

366
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:14,595
Then why did Zehra say that?

367
00:33:16,755 --> 00:33:19,074
She was smoking, I was just with her.

368
00:33:19,316 --> 00:33:21,636
I don't do it.

369
00:33:22,915 --> 00:33:24,516
You are overreacting, Devin.

370
00:33:24,554 --> 00:33:26,596
This is not overreacting.

371
00:33:26,956 --> 00:33:29,476
People die from this in
even once. You know right?

372
00:33:29,514 --> 00:33:31,675
Like I said, I got nothing
to do with that stuff.

373
00:33:31,715 --> 00:33:33,316
Don't worry.

374
00:33:34,155 --> 00:33:36,836
Don't you worry about Zehra at all?

375
00:33:37,276 --> 00:33:39,395
I am worried.

376
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:42,395
Her parents will set her up
to marry a random dude soon.

377
00:33:42,435 --> 00:33:45,035
That's what I am worried about.

378
00:33:45,756 --> 00:33:47,755
Here, people die when they are alive too.

379
00:33:47,795 --> 00:33:49,835
You don't know.

380
00:33:52,275 --> 00:33:55,275
Haven't you done some drugs too anyway?

381
00:33:55,555 --> 00:33:57,675
I bet your friends know this stuff better.

382
00:33:57,716 --> 00:34:00,596
But Fehmi, it's not the same thing with bonzai.

383
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:04,515
Alright, I'm telling you. It's cool.

384
00:34:05,236 --> 00:34:08,875
For real. I'm not doing it.

385
00:34:16,995 --> 00:34:18,915
Do you want to hear a terrible joke?

386
00:34:19,195 --> 00:34:21,716
-Go ahead.
-Yeah?

387
00:34:23,035 --> 00:34:26,275
All pigeons are actually rappers.

388
00:34:28,436 --> 00:34:29,755
Why?

389
00:34:29,796 --> 00:34:32,556
Because they walk like this.

390
00:34:34,835 --> 00:34:36,116
Idiot.

391
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:37,876
What?

392
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:40,236
Bro, you're not gonna
believe who just called.

393
00:34:40,275 --> 00:34:42,156
No way you can guess.

394
00:34:42,195 --> 00:34:43,435
Who called?

395
00:34:43,475 --> 00:34:44,995
Faruk Ünal.

396
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:46,755
You mean the famous Faruk Ünal?

397
00:34:46,796 --> 00:34:47,835
Yes, 'the' Faruk Ünal.

398
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:49,755
Will he put you on his talent show?

399
00:34:49,795 --> 00:34:52,316
No man. He wants to produce a rap album.

400
00:34:52,355 --> 00:34:55,196
He asked about our other songs.
I said we have it all ready.

401
00:34:55,235 --> 00:34:57,035
He wants to see us in
the studio this weekend,

402
00:34:57,076 --> 00:34:58,435
to hear all the songs.

403
00:34:58,476 --> 00:35:00,236
My god! Is the album finally
gonna come out?

404
00:35:00,276 --> 00:35:01,756
Finally bro, finally.

405
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:04,555
But your songs aren't ready.

406
00:35:05,076 --> 00:35:07,355
Why didn't you ask for some time bro?

407
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,675
Cuz when you find an opportunity
like this you gotta jump on it.

408
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:13,635
If I asked for time, he could change
his mind later and we'd be fucked.

409
00:35:14,035 --> 00:35:14,955
Right.

410
00:35:14,995 --> 00:35:16,195
I know what I am talking about.

411
00:35:16,235 --> 00:35:18,715
So where are you at with the songs?

412
00:35:18,756 --> 00:35:20,836
Two songs have rip off beats.

413
00:35:21,315 --> 00:35:23,036
One needs to be recorded.

414
00:35:23,075 --> 00:35:24,715
We don't have money for the studio.

415
00:35:30,235 --> 00:35:32,076
I can do it.

416
00:35:32,476 --> 00:35:34,156
For real?

417
00:35:34,195 --> 00:35:36,476
I have equipment too, we can record it.

418
00:35:36,515 --> 00:35:37,956
At your place?

419
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:44,755
Yeah, the intro is too long. Do
you think we should shorten it?

420
00:35:49,595 --> 00:35:52,555
I think that'll be better for the rhyme.

421
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,436
How's it going?

422
00:36:04,475 --> 00:36:05,995
Almost done.

423
00:36:07,596 --> 00:36:09,916
I'll wrap up in a bit and play it to you.

424
00:36:09,956 --> 00:36:13,236
Alright let's check the end again.
We were going to increase the base.

425
00:36:23,995 --> 00:36:26,995
Guys you are both saying the same thing.

426
00:36:27,315 --> 00:36:31,235
Come sing over the new beat.
Let's see how it works.

427
00:37:29,955 --> 00:37:32,155
It's gonna be amazing!

428
00:37:32,195 --> 00:37:34,276
Seriously guys, great job!

429
00:37:37,836 --> 00:37:39,955
Good job, Devin!

430
00:38:31,035 --> 00:38:32,156
Fehmi?

431
00:38:47,676 --> 00:38:50,075
It's okay. Let's talk.

432
00:38:50,635 --> 00:38:53,836
Put it out. You can't smoke that.

433
00:38:57,475 --> 00:38:59,115
Look at me.

434
00:39:00,075 --> 00:39:03,195
I'm sorry.

435
00:39:06,075 --> 00:39:09,715
Why did you lie to me?

436
00:39:13,036 --> 00:39:15,516
You didn't mind Timur snorting coke...

437
00:39:15,555 --> 00:39:18,396
... or Azra popping ex.

438
00:39:19,876 --> 00:39:22,116
What's the problem?

439
00:39:22,155 --> 00:39:25,155
Is Bonzai too trashy for your bourgeoise ass?

440
00:39:25,195 --> 00:39:27,556
You have no idea what I've been through.

441
00:39:27,596 --> 00:39:31,355
I don't want to lose someone I love again Fehmi.

442
00:39:39,116 --> 00:39:40,955
Let's finish the songs professionaly.

443
00:39:40,995 --> 00:39:42,396
We'll talk later.

444
00:40:00,555 --> 00:40:02,996
How long have you been doing it?

445
00:40:03,035 --> 00:40:05,195
Two years.

446
00:40:05,235 --> 00:40:07,715
On and off. I quit but start again.

447
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:10,715
Why do you start again?

448
00:40:10,755 --> 00:40:14,115
Is there a certain reason?

449
00:40:14,636 --> 00:40:19,675
Do you start when you're down,
or when you're in the mood?

450
00:40:22,955 --> 00:40:26,235
I don't know Devin.

451
00:40:30,956 --> 00:40:35,756
I'm asking because,
I feel very happy with you.

452
00:40:36,515 --> 00:40:38,356
Aren't you happy?

453
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:40,475
I am.

454
00:40:40,515 --> 00:40:42,835
I'm very happy.

455
00:40:45,636 --> 00:40:50,996
What is your problem then?
What more do you want?

456
00:40:53,635 --> 00:40:55,236
Okay.

457
00:40:55,756 --> 00:40:59,395
Let me prove myself to you.

458
00:41:04,436 --> 00:41:06,515
Please.

459
00:41:17,036 --> 00:41:18,796
Promise?

460
00:41:20,036 --> 00:41:21,556
Promise.

461
00:41:21,795 --> 00:41:23,356
Promise?

462
00:41:23,756 --> 00:41:25,235
Promise.

463
00:41:38,115 --> 00:41:41,075
Hip-hop rescue us,
the streets are full of lies

464
00:41:41,115 --> 00:41:43,715
Soul flows throug the mic,
it's the only salvation in life

465
00:41:43,755 --> 00:41:46,315
They didn't stop this fire,
flames are growing bigger

466
00:41:46,355 --> 00:41:48,795
They didn't stop this fire,
the flames are all over

467
00:41:48,836 --> 00:41:51,515
Education on the streets
beats your college degrees

468
00:41:51,555 --> 00:41:54,196
You frame and hang those bullshit degrees

469
00:41:54,235 --> 00:41:56,796
We got itches, bruises and fights, all day all night

470
00:41:56,836 --> 00:41:59,475
Our school is called pain,
we tasted all sorts of it

471
00:41:59,515 --> 00:42:01,756
We kept going, never feared the end of it

472
00:42:01,795 --> 00:42:04,395
The path was dark ahead, but didn't step back

473
00:42:04,435 --> 00:42:06,716
We never worshipped anything but rap

474
00:42:06,755 --> 00:42:10,116
They say it's devil's music, we didn't give a crap

475
00:42:10,956 --> 00:42:12,836
Very good, boys.

476
00:42:12,876 --> 00:42:14,275
Very good.

477
00:42:14,315 --> 00:42:17,676
You have a unique style.
The lyrics are moving.

478
00:42:17,956 --> 00:42:21,076
We actually recorded these
at home with limited equipment.

479
00:42:21,116 --> 00:42:24,315
If we did a decent recording
I think it'd turn out better.

480
00:42:24,355 --> 00:42:26,316
Yeah we can do much better.

481
00:42:26,355 --> 00:42:30,195
That doesn't matter.
You can re-record anytime.

482
00:42:30,235 --> 00:42:33,955
Your work has soul in it.

483
00:42:33,996 --> 00:42:37,116
Go to the best studio, but if
you don't have that soul...

484
00:42:37,156 --> 00:42:39,915
...your work will be piece of trash.

485
00:42:39,955 --> 00:42:41,676
Exactly, soul is important for us.

486
00:42:41,715 --> 00:42:43,075
Yes, very important.

487
00:42:43,115 --> 00:42:45,875
We talk about our hood and our life.

488
00:42:45,916 --> 00:42:47,436
About Karaçınar.

489
00:42:47,475 --> 00:42:50,795
I say let's do a studio session
next week and play around.

490
00:42:50,836 --> 00:42:52,035
What do you say?

491
00:42:52,076 --> 00:42:55,475
Maybe we can even release your first album.

492
00:43:05,556 --> 00:43:07,075
Enough with the dumb jokes man.

493
00:43:09,035 --> 00:43:11,156
You look so ugly in pictures!

494
00:43:14,596 --> 00:43:17,076
We'll make the album!

495
00:43:18,795 --> 00:43:20,115
Should have taken a picture of that.

496
00:43:20,435 --> 00:43:22,475
De Hakikat.

497
00:43:23,715 --> 00:43:26,916
Yo Yunus! Devin will join the band from now on.

498
00:43:26,956 --> 00:43:29,556
We changed the name to De Hakikat.

499
00:43:29,595 --> 00:43:32,436
You're even bigger losers now.

500
00:43:44,395 --> 00:43:46,315
Alright, I'm taking off.

501
00:44:11,516 --> 00:44:13,075
You're awake.

502
00:44:13,635 --> 00:44:15,395
Sit down.

503
00:44:17,195 --> 00:44:19,515
What's going on?

504
00:44:22,155 --> 00:44:25,796
Why did you take my phone if
you were going to keep it off?

505
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:27,915
The battery died Pa.

506
00:44:28,516 --> 00:44:31,075
That phone is only for when he wants to reach us.

507
00:44:31,595 --> 00:44:34,035
Tell me, what's going on?

508
00:44:35,435 --> 00:44:38,116
He has no clue.

509
00:44:40,395 --> 00:44:42,315
You've stolen from the deli.

510
00:44:42,356 --> 00:44:45,435
They asked our father to pay it back.

511
00:44:45,676 --> 00:44:49,275
I didn't steal that money,
I just borrowed it.

512
00:44:49,315 --> 00:44:52,636
I didn't get to tell the boss yet.
I couldn't go to work since.

513
00:44:53,555 --> 00:44:55,556
You're a disgrace.

514
00:44:55,595 --> 00:44:57,436
I swear, with my next salary,
was going to-

515
00:44:57,476 --> 00:45:00,316
Which next salary? You're fired already.

516
00:45:00,356 --> 00:45:02,116
They said you haven't showed up for days.

517
00:45:02,155 --> 00:45:03,476
But I texted you.

518
00:45:03,516 --> 00:45:06,195
And I texted back, said
I'm done covering your ass.

519
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:08,075
Haven't you read?

520
00:45:09,475 --> 00:45:12,915
Anyway, I don't need that job anymore.

521
00:45:13,435 --> 00:45:16,516
I'm gonna bring a lot of cash home soon.

522
00:45:16,835 --> 00:45:21,756
Faruk Ünal is going to produce our album.

523
00:45:21,996 --> 00:45:24,395
We prepped the songs, stayed up all night.

524
00:45:24,435 --> 00:45:26,676
Then we went to his studio.

525
00:45:26,715 --> 00:45:28,756
He digged the songs big time.

526
00:45:28,996 --> 00:45:30,755
Don't worry about the deli job.

527
00:45:33,315 --> 00:45:36,515
Couldn't you find a more believeable lie?

528
00:45:36,995 --> 00:45:39,316
You don't believe me?

529
00:45:39,556 --> 00:45:42,436
Of course I don't. Look at yourself.

530
00:45:42,475 --> 00:45:45,196
What's Faruk gonna do with someone like you?

531
00:45:48,476 --> 00:45:49,436
Fehmi.

532
00:45:50,635 --> 00:45:54,075
Don't bring shame on us.

533
00:46:00,875 --> 00:46:04,556
That's all I want from you, son.

534
00:46:13,475 --> 00:46:15,675
What's wrong with you bro?

535
00:46:16,036 --> 00:46:17,556
Nothing.

536
00:46:18,236 --> 00:46:20,836
Having problems with your chick?

537
00:46:20,876 --> 00:46:24,115
Is it the rich girl, poor boy tragedy?

538
00:46:24,755 --> 00:46:27,156
I said nothing. Allah allah.

539
00:46:27,836 --> 00:46:30,596
Leave him alone.

540
00:46:33,395 --> 00:46:36,955
Don't mind them Fehmi.

541
00:46:39,995 --> 00:46:44,156
Zehra can you give me some of
your bonzai? I want to be alone.

542
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:49,035
Let me see.

543
00:46:55,156 --> 00:46:58,436
But what about tomorrow?

544
00:46:58,475 --> 00:47:03,435
Don't start with me Zehra,
I'm in a bad mood.

545
00:47:12,836 --> 00:47:14,115
We lost eight lives left out of nine

546
00:47:14,155 --> 00:47:15,716
Music is the last one that remained

547
00:47:15,755 --> 00:47:18,955
I wish I could erase my destiny and rewrite it

548
00:47:18,996 --> 00:47:22,316
Don't trust your youth, the
streets will suck it out of you

549
00:47:22,355 --> 00:47:24,236
The fastest ones among us are now in the coffin

550
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:25,756
But I'll be the king of the city

551
00:47:25,795 --> 00:47:27,475
Since the cradle, all I hear are the bullets

552
00:47:27,516 --> 00:47:29,276
The birds sing from afar

553
00:47:29,316 --> 00:47:30,276
When you have it, it is death

554
00:47:30,315 --> 00:47:31,236
When you don't, it's pain

555
00:47:31,275 --> 00:47:32,955
We are outcasts for them

556
00:47:34,955 --> 00:47:38,476
They holler from all corners,
under the infulence of many things

557
00:47:39,196 --> 00:47:41,715
My wallet is empty but my mind is full

558
00:47:42,476 --> 00:47:44,396
I can find the way without a penny

559
00:47:47,796 --> 00:47:52,515
Can I give it one last try?
I will nail it this time.

560
00:47:53,475 --> 00:47:55,715
I will try one more time.

561
00:47:56,275 --> 00:47:58,916
Okay, go for it.

562
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:05,916
They holler from all corners,
under the infulence of many things

563
00:48:06,155 --> 00:48:08,075
My wallet is empty but my mind is full

564
00:48:08,116 --> 00:48:10,156
I can find the way without a penny

565
00:48:10,475 --> 00:48:14,115
If you point at us, it'll cost you an arm.
In my roads -

566
00:48:14,436 --> 00:48:16,395
Let's stop.

567
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:22,195
Fehmi, go wash your face. Get yourself
together. We're good for today.

568
00:48:26,595 --> 00:48:28,035
Can't believe we've come to this.

569
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:29,916
He'll never work with us. You'll see.

570
00:48:30,155 --> 00:48:32,475
We'll never get a chance
like this again. It's over.

571
00:48:32,516 --> 00:48:33,356
What did he say?

572
00:48:33,395 --> 00:48:35,116
The album deal is off.

573
00:48:35,156 --> 00:48:38,515
No, he only said we need more time.

574
00:48:38,956 --> 00:48:42,836
That means fuck off. He
basically said suck my dick.

575
00:48:43,476 --> 00:48:46,916
We are good. He can't easily find rappers like us.

576
00:48:47,756 --> 00:48:50,595
You think Istanbul consists of Karaçnar?

577
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:51,635
Relax man.

578
00:48:51,675 --> 00:48:53,435
There's a shit ton of rappers out there.

579
00:48:53,475 --> 00:48:55,956
No one would bother with a junkie like you.

580
00:48:55,996 --> 00:48:57,636
Why should they?

581
00:48:57,675 --> 00:48:58,996
Yunus you are being a prick.

582
00:48:59,035 --> 00:49:01,275
No, you are being a prick.

583
00:49:01,316 --> 00:49:03,475
You couldn't get your shit
together for fuck's sake.

584
00:49:03,516 --> 00:49:06,116
You are going down and
you're taking me with you.

585
00:49:06,156 --> 00:49:07,796
Then jusy fuck off man.

586
00:49:07,835 --> 00:49:09,795
Go do whatever the fuck you want, okay?

587
00:49:09,836 --> 00:49:13,915
You're attacking me where
you should be apologizing.

588
00:49:13,956 --> 00:49:15,835
You've put me through all sorts
of shit in the last two years.

589
00:49:15,876 --> 00:49:18,435
Did I I ever tell you to fuck off, ha?

590
00:49:19,036 --> 00:49:20,595
I didn't.

591
00:49:20,915 --> 00:49:23,995
You should have said it.
You should have let it out.

592
00:49:24,035 --> 00:49:25,795
Is that also my fault now.

593
00:49:25,835 --> 00:49:28,275
Whatever man. Fine.

594
00:49:28,315 --> 00:49:29,795
Fine.

595
00:49:41,755 --> 00:49:45,195
Aren't you going to say something?

596
00:49:46,955 --> 00:49:49,756
If I talk now, I'll upset you.

597
00:49:50,316 --> 00:49:53,795
I didn't do anything to you?
Why are you mad?

598
00:49:54,956 --> 00:49:57,635
You promised.

599
00:49:58,475 --> 00:50:04,395
Don't do this Devin.
I need you on my side right now.

600
00:50:05,075 --> 00:50:07,115
I'm going home.

601
00:50:08,475 --> 00:50:11,115
You don't even love me.

602
00:50:11,156 --> 00:50:13,596
You only care about my rap.

603
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:16,835
Otherwise you'd stay with me now.

604
00:50:17,355 --> 00:50:20,515
What are you talking about Fehmi?

605
00:50:20,756 --> 00:50:23,196
You call that rap, what you did in there?

606
00:50:23,236 --> 00:50:25,075
You're nothing without Yunus.

607
00:50:25,116 --> 00:50:27,876
You would never come this far.

608
00:50:40,476 --> 00:50:43,755
'There are no airports in our hood,
but everyone is flying high.'

609
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:46,836
Selam Aleykum (Hello).

610
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:49,116
Aleykum selam (Hello).

611
00:50:49,716 --> 00:50:53,396
Sorry to bother, but I wanted
to ask for something.

612
00:50:53,435 --> 00:50:55,996
Sure, no problem.
What do you want to buy?

613
00:50:56,035 --> 00:50:59,595
Not like that. It's about Fehmi.

614
00:50:59,915 --> 00:51:03,235
He's not doing well, he got
kicked out of school too.

615
00:51:03,276 --> 00:51:05,996
Poor thing.

616
00:51:07,555 --> 00:51:09,115
Why are you making fun?

617
00:51:09,156 --> 00:51:13,035
You have a brother too,
you should understand.

618
00:51:13,276 --> 00:51:16,436
We ain't pointing a gun to his head to buy the stuff.

619
00:51:16,475 --> 00:51:18,555
Go tame your brother, man.

620
00:51:18,595 --> 00:51:20,676
Don't pester us.

621
00:51:20,716 --> 00:51:23,996
Why am I trying to reason with you?
You're a bunch of scumbags.

622
00:51:24,035 --> 00:51:26,675
Watch your mouth!

623
00:51:27,595 --> 00:51:29,435
Please don't. We are
neighbors in this hood.

624
00:51:29,476 --> 00:51:32,835
Fehmi owes me 80 liras.

625
00:51:34,956 --> 00:51:37,156
Debt paid.

626
00:51:37,195 --> 00:51:38,676
At least give me the 20 lira change.

627
00:51:38,715 --> 00:51:42,035
Fuck off. Get the fuck out.

628
00:51:42,835 --> 00:51:44,755
Don't come here again.

629
00:51:44,795 --> 00:51:48,835
Tell that cop friend of yours,
he's not welcome either.

630
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:50,996
You hear?

631
00:51:51,436 --> 00:51:53,596
God knows what he is.

632
00:51:53,635 --> 00:51:54,875
Faggot.

633
00:52:03,435 --> 00:52:05,556
You didn't have to come.
I'm okay.

634
00:52:05,595 --> 00:52:07,155
Don't worry.

635
00:52:07,436 --> 00:52:09,435
You wanted him to quit the night job anyway.

636
00:52:09,475 --> 00:52:11,716
But not like this.

637
00:52:11,755 --> 00:52:14,275
People will talk behind our back,
they'll call us thieves.

638
00:52:14,316 --> 00:52:17,675
Dad will start working again,
but he needs to rest. All this shit.

639
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:42,836
Welcome.

640
00:52:44,356 --> 00:52:46,836
How much will you pay for this phone?

641
00:52:47,236 --> 00:52:50,035
I can give you 50.

642
00:53:16,996 --> 00:53:18,356
What's wrong bro?

643
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:20,276
Just give me the money.

644
00:53:20,316 --> 00:53:22,595
I want three packs.

645
00:53:25,315 --> 00:53:30,036
If your brother asks, you're not
getting these from me, OK?

646
00:53:30,275 --> 00:53:31,915
Deal?

647
00:53:31,956 --> 00:53:33,436
Yeah okay man.

648
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:35,116
Good.

649
00:53:36,076 --> 00:53:37,515
Here.

650
00:53:54,996 --> 00:53:57,076
Over here.

651
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:02,435
Look at yourself.

652
00:54:02,995 --> 00:54:05,676
You fucked it all up.

653
00:54:06,075 --> 00:54:09,195
You're gonna be a rapper ha?
Same story two years.

654
00:54:09,236 --> 00:54:11,915
You're nothing without Yunus.

655
00:54:11,955 --> 00:54:14,515
You would never come this far.

656
00:54:15,235 --> 00:54:17,236
You know it too.

657
00:54:17,675 --> 00:54:19,235
You know it.

658
00:54:42,235 --> 00:54:43,915
Fuck you.

659
00:54:44,435 --> 00:54:46,355
Prick.

660
00:54:50,635 --> 00:54:52,395
Fuck off.

661
00:55:24,036 --> 00:55:25,195
Don't laugh.

662
00:55:25,236 --> 00:55:26,555
Call an ambulance.

663
00:55:26,596 --> 00:55:28,156
You're fine bro.

664
00:55:29,116 --> 00:55:30,515
It's no big deal.

665
00:55:31,915 --> 00:55:32,835
What are you doing?

666
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:34,475
-It's just a video man.
-Fuck off.

667
00:55:36,155 --> 00:55:37,555
Hey, hey, it's okay.

668
00:55:37,596 --> 00:55:38,556
Calm down.

669
00:55:38,595 --> 00:55:40,155
It's just a bad trip.

670
00:55:40,196 --> 00:55:42,635
Look at me, you're
going to be alright.

671
00:55:42,676 --> 00:55:44,075
Yunus, call an ambulance.

672
00:55:44,115 --> 00:55:46,516
Easy bro, you're tripping,
you're fine.

673
00:55:46,875 --> 00:55:48,675
It'll be over, just chill.

674
00:55:54,155 --> 00:55:57,076
Easy, easy.

675
00:55:57,315 --> 00:56:00,155
It's over.

676
00:56:00,675 --> 00:56:03,755
You need to go see your brother.

677
00:56:26,915 --> 00:56:29,675
I'm sorry brother.

678
00:56:30,755 --> 00:56:32,515
I'm sorry.

679
00:56:51,516 --> 00:56:55,955
What have you done, you son of a bitch?

680
00:56:56,235 --> 00:56:58,676
What did you want from my brother?

681
00:56:58,715 --> 00:56:59,675
Fehmi, don't mess with them.

682
00:56:59,955 --> 00:57:00,915
Fehmi, calm down.

683
00:57:03,075 --> 00:57:04,676
You think you can beat me up?

684
00:57:04,716 --> 00:57:06,076
Who do you think you are?

685
00:57:07,556 --> 00:57:08,475
Fuck off!

686
00:57:08,516 --> 00:57:09,875
It's okay guys.

687
00:57:26,995 --> 00:57:29,956
I fucked it all up.

688
00:58:11,035 --> 00:58:13,156
His fans were crying during the concerts.

689
00:58:13,195 --> 00:58:15,596
He says, he was moved by that.

690
00:58:17,875 --> 00:58:22,795
During the tour, J Dilla was going to
the hospital for dialysis every morning.

691
00:58:27,355 --> 00:58:29,555
Are you okay?

692
00:58:29,596 --> 00:58:31,755
It's starting again.

693
00:58:31,796 --> 00:58:33,996
Some food maybe?

694
00:58:34,035 --> 00:58:37,116
Play it. It keeps my mind busy.

695
00:58:41,355 --> 00:58:47,996
He was tenacious, he never gave up.
He went on that stage every single night.

696
00:58:49,515 --> 00:58:53,275
He says Dilla was truly a warrior.

697
00:59:11,515 --> 00:59:15,195
Devin, you go to sleep.

698
00:59:16,236 --> 00:59:19,276
I think I'll go back to the hood.

699
00:59:21,196 --> 00:59:23,076
Why?

700
00:59:23,116 --> 00:59:28,876
Can't sleep like this. Don't want to bother you.

701
00:59:31,596 --> 00:59:35,156
Alright, I'll stay up with you.

702
00:59:36,035 --> 00:59:41,476
You don't understand. It's getting worse.

703
00:59:41,955 --> 00:59:46,355
Maybe it'll help, even if it's just one puff.

704
00:59:48,155 --> 00:59:52,635
Then what? You'll feel like this again after.

705
00:59:52,955 --> 00:59:56,956
I think it's more realistic to quit slowly.

706
00:59:56,996 --> 00:59:59,955
Don't fool yourself. Remember
what you said this morning.

707
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:01,955
Hang on.

708
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:11,715
Don't.

709
01:00:12,076 --> 01:00:14,636
Okay.

710
01:00:14,956 --> 01:00:17,956
Fuck you Devin.

711
01:00:18,356 --> 01:00:20,355
What's going on Fehmi?

712
01:00:20,395 --> 01:00:21,715
I heard what you said.

713
01:00:21,755 --> 01:00:23,675
What did I say?

714
01:00:24,396 --> 01:00:26,876
You said his name.

715
01:00:29,356 --> 01:00:30,716
Whose name did I say?

716
01:00:30,755 --> 01:00:32,315
You said Timur.

717
01:00:32,356 --> 01:00:34,755
What? You said don't,
and I said okay to you.

718
01:00:34,795 --> 01:00:36,036
You said Timur, I heard it.

719
01:00:36,076 --> 01:00:39,876
Fehmi, you said don't
do it and I said okay.

720
01:00:39,916 --> 01:00:42,275
You said Timur.

721
01:00:42,715 --> 01:00:45,276
You're full of shit.

722
01:01:20,916 --> 01:01:22,755
What are you doing?

723
01:01:24,395 --> 01:01:25,755
Don't go.

724
01:01:26,035 --> 01:01:27,236
Devin, move.

725
01:01:27,275 --> 01:01:29,995
Fehmi, listen to me.  You'll regret this later.

726
01:01:30,035 --> 01:01:32,276
I don't want your advice, cunt.

727
01:01:32,316 --> 01:01:34,115
Swear all you want. I don't care.

728
01:01:34,155 --> 01:01:36,116
I'm with you.

729
01:01:36,156 --> 01:01:38,316
I don't want you with me.
I don't want you.

730
01:01:38,356 --> 01:01:41,636
You're gonna get over this Fehmi.

731
01:01:41,995 --> 01:01:44,916
-I don't want to.
-But you promised. You promised, Fehmi.

732
01:01:44,955 --> 01:01:47,435
-I take it back.
-No, no!

733
01:01:47,755 --> 01:01:50,075
You can't help me.

734
01:01:50,315 --> 01:01:51,875
Move.

735
01:02:11,195 --> 01:02:13,716
Leave some for us too man.

736
01:02:38,436 --> 01:02:41,115
Is he going to peg out?

737
01:02:42,396 --> 01:02:44,996
You fuckers gave him too much.

738
01:02:46,675 --> 01:02:48,915
I don't want him to die in my house.

739
01:02:48,956 --> 01:02:51,075
Take him out.

740
01:03:05,716 --> 01:03:07,835
Forgive us bro.

741
01:03:19,755 --> 01:03:21,795
Isn't he your boy?

742
01:03:25,876 --> 01:03:27,396
Son.

743
01:03:27,435 --> 01:03:28,795
Wake up, son.

744
01:03:28,835 --> 01:03:30,116
Get some water!

745
01:03:30,155 --> 01:03:31,395
Are you alright son?

746
01:03:34,756 --> 01:03:35,915
Get up son.

747
01:03:36,875 --> 01:03:37,676
Come on.

748
01:03:56,355 --> 01:03:59,435
Are you alright?

749
01:04:01,155 --> 01:04:02,795
I will be.

750
01:04:02,835 --> 01:04:03,755
You will.

751
01:04:03,795 --> 01:04:05,636
I promise.

752
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,075
I'll be good.

753
01:04:07,395 --> 01:04:09,076
You will.

754
01:04:25,035 --> 01:04:28,075
The phone rang. It's an unknown number.

755
01:04:28,515 --> 01:04:31,836
'Am I speaking to Mr. Yunus?' Mr?

756
01:04:31,875 --> 01:04:35,315
'We are calling from Grand Hip-hop Fest'.

757
01:04:35,355 --> 01:04:39,796
We'd like to invite your band Hakikat to join'.

758
01:04:41,115 --> 01:04:44,115
This is like a miracle, for us
to sing at such a big festival.

759
01:04:44,155 --> 01:04:45,475
You know this too.

760
01:04:45,515 --> 01:04:46,595
Yes.

761
01:04:46,956 --> 01:04:52,075
I'm so happy for you. But, you
can do the concert without me.

762
01:04:52,436 --> 01:04:55,956
Any DJ would do.

763
01:04:55,996 --> 01:04:58,755
Devin look...

764
01:04:59,755 --> 01:05:02,635
Fehmi needs you.

765
01:05:18,795 --> 01:05:20,396
Go for it bro.

766
01:05:20,435 --> 01:05:22,275
Karaçınar 2015. Spit it.

767
01:05:23,716 --> 01:05:26,156
Kids don't have a fair start to life in my hood

768
01:05:26,195 --> 01:05:28,955
Trust me, they were never asked to choose

769
01:05:28,995 --> 01:05:31,076
Or they would never prefer to deal drugs

770
01:05:31,115 --> 01:05:33,395
Over going to school like other kids

771
01:05:33,436 --> 01:05:36,155
When a family struggles to survive for the day

772
01:05:36,196 --> 01:05:38,076
Childhood is no bed of roses

773
01:05:38,115 --> 01:05:39,995
Deep down they are truly naive

774
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:42,155
Can't tell a dealer from a teacher

775
01:05:42,196 --> 01:05:44,475
They got lost, and missed the way out

776
01:05:44,516 --> 01:05:46,835
Had no choice and drugs were the remedy

777
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:49,555
That remedy became the enemy

778
01:05:49,596 --> 01:05:51,956
This curse was impossible to escape

779
01:05:51,995 --> 01:05:54,436
We made it a habit to blind our eyes,

780
01:05:54,474 --> 01:05:56,636
surrendering to pain and bitterness

781
01:05:56,675 --> 01:05:59,076
Instead of facing the reality of this life

782
01:05:59,115 --> 01:06:01,796
It's better to zone out and benumb the mind

783
01:06:08,276 --> 01:06:11,716
Are you still mad at me?

784
01:06:15,955 --> 01:06:20,636
I'm not mad, I'm sad.

785
01:06:28,475 --> 01:06:31,635
I want to get my shit together this time.

786
01:06:31,675 --> 01:06:33,395
For real.

787
01:06:38,835 --> 01:06:43,195
Maybe you won't believe me anymore.

788
01:06:43,636 --> 01:06:46,915
But everyone will see in time.

789
01:06:48,596 --> 01:06:50,875
I still believe in you.

790
01:06:54,355 --> 01:06:55,995
Yes, bro, it was lost.

791
01:06:56,035 --> 01:06:56,956
Let me keep it.

792
01:06:56,995 --> 01:06:58,674
Maybe I will wear it to the concert tomorrow.

793
01:06:58,715 --> 01:07:01,636
Yunus you always do this man.

794
01:07:48,116 --> 01:07:51,995
Believe, it'll work out, everything will be alright.

795
01:07:52,916 --> 01:07:56,995
Against odds, despite fate, everything will be alright.

796
01:07:57,275 --> 01:07:59,315
Believe, believe, believe, believe

797
01:07:59,356 --> 01:08:01,595
Everything will be alright.

798
01:08:01,915 --> 01:08:05,595
Against odds, despite fate, everything will be alright.

799
01:08:24,275 --> 01:08:27,196
Bro, they saw Faruk's assistant in the VIP.

800
01:08:27,995 --> 01:08:30,435
Yeah, let's do this.

801
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:34,876
Are you okay?

802
01:08:34,916 --> 01:08:35,876
Yes.

803
01:08:36,836 --> 01:08:39,515
The gang is here. I'll check on them.

804
01:08:39,755 --> 01:08:42,675
You need anything?

805
01:08:43,195 --> 01:08:46,116
I will feel better once on stage. Don't worry.

806
01:08:46,156 --> 01:08:47,916
If you say so.

807
01:09:08,035 --> 01:09:10,716
Dude, they're saying it's packed.

808
01:09:17,235 --> 01:09:20,075
I'll roll one just in case.

809
01:09:34,795 --> 01:09:37,556
You're gonna smoke?

810
01:09:37,915 --> 01:09:41,595
Just one drag maybe.

811
01:09:43,435 --> 01:09:45,956
Wanna share?

812
01:10:02,796 --> 01:10:04,876
I'm good bro, thanks.

813
01:10:07,675 --> 01:10:10,395
I'm gonna run to the bathroom.

814
01:10:44,475 --> 01:10:46,276
Are you okay?

815
01:10:48,756 --> 01:10:50,075
Are you okay Fehmi?

816
01:10:50,116 --> 01:10:53,156
Get up, get up.

817
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:56,555
What did you do?

818
01:10:56,795 --> 01:10:58,475
Nothing.

819
01:10:58,715 --> 01:11:00,156
What did you do Fehmi?

820
01:11:00,195 --> 01:11:02,115
Get up.

821
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:07,635
What's going on?

822
01:11:10,235 --> 01:11:11,915
Look at me.

823
01:11:12,476 --> 01:11:14,195
What have you done?

824
01:11:14,235 --> 01:11:15,555
I chilled a bit.

825
01:11:15,595 --> 01:11:18,475
I see. You're chill as fuck. Can't stand straight.

826
01:11:18,516 --> 01:11:21,195
You are my curse, you fucking idiot.

827
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:22,595
Easy man.

828
01:11:23,275 --> 01:11:24,235
Fuck you, calm ha?

829
01:11:25,075 --> 01:11:26,515
You can't go on stage like this.

830
01:11:26,555 --> 01:11:27,316
I can.

831
01:11:27,355 --> 01:11:28,116
You can't.

832
01:11:28,156 --> 01:11:29,315
-I will.
-No, you can't.

833
01:11:29,356 --> 01:11:31,515
I'll take you to the stage now, are you ready?

834
01:11:33,675 --> 01:11:35,315
Batu, you know the
lyrics, you'll go on stage.

835
01:11:35,355 --> 01:11:36,155
Stop it.

836
01:11:36,195 --> 01:11:37,075
No Yunus!

837
01:11:37,115 --> 01:11:41,115
There'll be a change.
It's gonna be us two, ok?

838
01:11:41,475 --> 01:11:43,076
I can sing Yunus.

839
01:11:43,115 --> 01:11:45,075
You don't know what you're saying.

840
01:11:45,116 --> 01:11:47,555
It's my song. You can't do this.

841
01:11:48,915 --> 01:11:51,036
Hey. What's going on here?

842
01:11:51,596 --> 01:11:53,356
You can't do this to me.

843
01:11:53,395 --> 01:11:55,235
It's my song.

844
01:11:56,396 --> 01:11:58,395
What are you doing?

845
01:11:59,276 --> 01:12:02,956
Devin, we can't do this without you.

846
01:12:03,475 --> 01:12:06,355
I need you to stay. Please.

847
01:12:22,275 --> 01:12:25,635
Not outside, not at home

848
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:29,036
Can't find peace anywhere

849
01:12:29,075 --> 01:12:32,036
Like a gem, it's so hard to find

850
01:12:32,075 --> 01:12:35,596
Pop a pill, go chill, never mind

851
01:12:35,636 --> 01:12:37,195
Can't do no sacrifice

852
01:12:37,236 --> 01:12:38,995
You see yourself as flawless

853
01:12:39,036 --> 01:12:40,676
You're selfish, I never get you

854
01:12:40,716 --> 01:12:42,715
Try to see things my way

855
01:12:42,756 --> 01:12:45,315
Pieces of this puzzle, didn't fit sadly

856
01:12:45,356 --> 01:12:48,595
I'm heartbroken cause you never believed in me

857
01:12:48,636 --> 01:12:50,556
I walk around like a ghost

858
01:12:50,595 --> 01:12:52,236
You killed me with your bare hands

859
01:12:52,275 --> 01:12:53,836
The hospital corridors are dark

860
01:12:53,876 --> 01:12:55,715
There's no turning back

861
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:57,556
Can't stand being by myself

862
01:12:57,595 --> 01:12:59,035
My past is full of scars

863
01:12:59,076 --> 01:13:00,635
Greed is my only true friend

864
01:13:00,675 --> 01:13:02,356
Yunus is a beast on stage

865
01:13:02,395 --> 01:13:05,595
Chaos at home, chaos in streets, tired of this shit

866
01:13:05,636 --> 01:13:07,635
Dreams are high but my path is uphill

867
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:09,196
Can't get to the plains. No! No!

868
01:13:09,236 --> 01:13:10,355
I can't save anyone

869
01:13:10,395 --> 01:13:12,035
I'm fighting for my own life

870
01:13:12,076 --> 01:13:13,756
Nobody gives a hand, nobody cares

871
01:13:13,795 --> 01:13:15,635
I don't want your help anyway

872
01:13:15,676 --> 01:13:18,836
Clean yourself up, I'm done dying

873
01:13:18,875 --> 01:13:21,036
I'll hang on till the last day of my life

874
01:13:21,276 --> 01:13:22,796
I started a fire

875
01:13:23,115 --> 01:13:24,596
Started a fire

876
01:13:27,275 --> 01:13:29,916
We already started a fire

877
01:15:31,355 --> 01:15:33,155
No answer?

878
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:40,155
Keep it.

879
01:15:40,715 --> 01:15:43,435
She'll get back to you.

880
01:16:09,755 --> 01:16:13,595
But of course you need to keep working.

881
01:16:13,635 --> 01:16:16,355
You need to improve your skills.

882
01:16:16,395 --> 01:16:19,355
I see a big potential in you.

883
01:16:19,395 --> 01:16:24,516
...I can see you becoming
a big name in five years...

884
01:16:24,836 --> 01:16:27,875
I hope you keep doing this. Keep going!

885
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:35,275
Hey.

886
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:37,516
Hi.

887
01:17:45,596 --> 01:17:47,875
How are you?

888
01:17:47,916 --> 01:17:50,755
I'm okay.

889
01:17:52,036 --> 01:17:53,635
You?

890
01:17:53,676 --> 01:17:55,636
I'm good.

891
01:18:00,995 --> 01:18:04,995
I could have come to the hood too.

892
01:18:06,355 --> 01:18:10,276
No problem. It's a change of scenery for me.

893
01:18:10,635 --> 01:18:13,316
Haven't left the hood in a while.

894
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:18,755
I took my brother's job. I've been living
back and forth between home and work.

895
01:18:18,796 --> 01:18:21,715
How are you doing?

896
01:18:22,035 --> 01:18:26,076
Just working, not much.

897
01:18:29,395 --> 01:18:32,916
You're looking good.

898
01:18:33,835 --> 01:18:39,475
I've been clean for five weeks.
If that's what you're asking.

899
01:18:39,916 --> 01:18:42,636
Really?

900
01:18:48,315 --> 01:18:51,395
I've been thinking of you all the time.

901
01:18:52,236 --> 01:18:54,635
You are always on my mind.

902
01:18:56,916 --> 01:19:01,316
But you never answered my calls.

903
01:19:12,836 --> 01:19:15,355
Don't.

904
01:19:26,635 --> 01:19:30,595
Why did you want to meet?

905
01:19:39,196 --> 01:19:42,395
I wrote a beat for you.

906
01:19:42,635 --> 01:19:48,076
Maybe you'll use it for one of your new songs.

907
01:19:48,916 --> 01:19:55,196
Thanks. But I'm not sure if I'll get back at it.

908
01:19:55,236 --> 01:19:59,235
You can give it to someone else if you want.

909
01:19:59,955 --> 01:20:02,035
No.

910
01:20:07,795 --> 01:20:09,435
Keep it.

911
01:20:10,556 --> 01:20:14,996
Maybe you'll change your mind.

912
01:20:38,036 --> 01:20:40,756
Take care.

913
01:22:28,556 --> 01:22:31,755
Calling out from the bottom of hell,
what's next for me I can't tell

914
01:22:31,795 --> 01:22:34,355
Why does all the paths I take,
lead to a freefall?

915
01:22:34,395 --> 01:22:38,395
I'm drowning  in my thoughts,
gotta run and chase my dreams

916
01:22:38,436 --> 01:22:42,315
I'm on an endless journey,
from this curse i need to break free

917
01:22:42,355 --> 01:22:45,156
Even if I'm all alone,
I'll make it to the plains

918
01:22:45,195 --> 01:22:48,716
I fell and I couldn't hold onto you,
didn't hold onto you

919
01:22:48,756 --> 01:22:51,275
I have no fear in me,
I'm gonna make it

920
01:22:51,316 --> 01:22:53,556
I survived dark nights all by myself

921
01:22:53,595 --> 01:22:56,116
Exhiled from my hood,
estranged from my family

922
01:22:56,156 --> 01:22:59,316
The razzle was a trap,
but now I do get by

923
01:22:59,355 --> 01:23:01,315
I'll throw the weight off my shoulders

924
01:23:01,356 --> 01:23:04,035
Will sing to thousands,
those days are gonna come

925
01:23:04,076 --> 01:23:07,715
Will smile from the stage
and strike a pose

926
01:23:08,076 --> 01:23:10,956
My final words are yet to come

927
01:23:20,059 --> 01:23:25,059
