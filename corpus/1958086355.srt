[ominous music]

2
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:12,245
Our daughter, Shannon,
was on the rebound

3
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,148
from a broken engagement.

4
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:16,916
Anyway, about a
week later, she was

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,653
invited to a friend's wedding.

6
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:24,424
And she didn't want to go.

7
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,192
I encouraged her to go.

8
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:29,062
Well, we-- we both did.

9
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:32,098
We thought that
she should get out.

10
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,535
Might meet somebody nice.

11
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,971
She met Dave.

12
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:41,374
We know now that he
went to that reception

13
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:44,811
with just one thing in
mind, to find someone

14
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:48,615
to marry and then to murder.

15
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,582
[jazz music]

16
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:52,986
[chatter]

17
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,260
She's a party animal.

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,194
Definitely not your type.

19
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:02,095
Michael!

20
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,163
You did it, man.

21
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,131
You actually showed
up, said the words.

22
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,100
Dave, I was so nervous
standing up there

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,170
waiting for Jackie, that I could
actually feel my legs shaking.

24
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,073
But when I saw her
coming down the aisle--

25
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,141
is she beautiful or what?

26
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,777
I just hope I can find
someone as nice as your family.

27
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:18,711
MICHAEL: Oh.

28
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,647
Um, who's Jackie talking to?

29
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,015
A friend of hers.

30
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,217
All I can tell you is she just
got through with a seriously

31
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:25,852
disastrous relationship.

32
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,287
She got all teary-eyed
when she saw

33
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:28,621
Jackie in her wedding dress.

34
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:30,056
DAVE DAVIS: What's her name?

35
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:30,990
I'm drawing a blank.

36
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,058
Oh.

37
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:33,893
But she's a nurse
at Jackie's hospital.

38
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,161
Why don't you go
back to your bride.

39
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,563
Entertain your guests.
I'll mingle.

40
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:37,564
OK.

41
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,008
Want to get married?

42
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,744
[chuckles] Yeah, right.

43
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:52,679
Why not?

44
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,747
The minister's already here.

45
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:55,849
I've been watching him.

46
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,150
He's had a couple of drinks.

47
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,418
We might be able
to get a discount.

48
00:01:58,518 --> 00:01:59,519
Well, don't you
think we should

49
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,653
get to know each other first?

50
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:01,688
DAVE DAVIS: I think that's
a little old-fashioned,

51
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,689
don't you?

52
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,023
Hm, I'm an old-fashioned
kind of girl.

53
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,158
Then you want some champagne.

54
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,159
Waiter.

55
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,531
Hi, I'm Dave.

56
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,732
Dave Davis.

57
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,501
Well, that's easy to remember.

58
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,270
Well, even when I'm drinking,
I hardly ever forget who I am.

59
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,172
Who are you?

60
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:20,406
Shannon Mohr.

61
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:21,374
The Shannon Mohr?

62
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,275
From Toledo?

63
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,477
(CHUCKLING) Oh!

64
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:27,180
You've been doing your
research, Mr. Dave Davis.

65
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,116
Never underestimate how
far a little information

66
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:31,384
will get you.

67
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,486
Maybe you've gone as
far as you're going.

68
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:38,725
Well, uh, I'd like to think
we just getting started.

69
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,027
Oh, I see.

70
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,695
So start by telling
me about you.

71
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,297
[scoffs] My story
is too long a story.

72
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:45,331
I'd much rather talk about you.

73
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:48,001
Oh, isn't there
a short version?

74
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,402
Short version.

75
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:56,176
Well, first thing I remember is
being in an orphanage in Texas

76
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:59,112
with a bunch of French
nuns, can you believe it?

77
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,213
Not really.

78
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,748
It's the truth, actually.

79
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,583
Then I went to play football
with Bo Schembechler

80
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,018
at the University of Michigan.

81
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,986
I actually went
to the Rose Bowl.

82
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:08,188
I'll buy that.

83
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,889
A couple of tours.

84
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,058
Vietnam.

85
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:13,226
What do you do now?

86
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,929
I'm just a rich old farmer.

87
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,097
At least nobody
shot at me, lately.

88
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,633
My god, you were shot?

89
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:21,935
Not just once.

90
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,304
What happened?

91
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,105
That's the long version.

92
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,240
Come on, let's dance.

93
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,714
[sultry music]

94
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:00,733
Hi, Mrs. Lovetts.

95
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:01,634
Hi

96
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:02,735
That's a new robe, isn't it?

97
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,338
Yeah, my daughter from
Tulsa gave it to me.

98
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,540
She's the legal
secretary, right?

99
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,042
She's she used to
want to be a lawyer.

100
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,743
Now she hates them.

101
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:11,778
You keep exercising.

102
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:12,912
That's the key to
getting out of here.

103
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:13,913
Thank you, dear.

104
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,820
I need a kiss from
a beautiful woman.

105
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,922
And I'm prepared to do
anything to get one.

106
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,258
Anything?

107
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,159
Mm!

108
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,162
That was easy.

109
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,730
[clears throat]

110
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,631
Jackie.

111
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,033
(CHUCKLING) Oh!

112
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:37,003
I have one more patient to
look in on before we can go.

113
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,372
I'll take care of it.

114
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:40,406
Are you sure?

115
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,374
I'm a newlywed.

116
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,842
I know about love.

117
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,477
You go on.

118
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,045
It's Mr. Chapman in 107.

119
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,814
He needs his Ibgard 30
minutes before his meal.

120
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:48,715
Sure.

121
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,551
Thank you.

122
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,921
Ibgard, isopropamide, the
guy's got a colon or a bladder

123
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,323
kicking up that
needs calming down.

124
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:58,424
What?

125
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,360
Were you a doctor in
a previous life, too?

126
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,627
Thought about it for a while.

127
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:05,231
I studied psychopharmacology,
University of Michigan.

128
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,999
Yeah, football-playing
pharmacist, that

129
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,302
would have been a good one.

130
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:10,603
What are you doing?

131
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:16,509
[gentle music]

132
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:17,610
Does that answer
your question?

133
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,446
[gentle music]

134
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,448
No, we'll get caught.

135
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,883
You heard what Jackie said.

136
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,284
Now it's your turn.

137
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,623
[kissing sounds]

138
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,559
Hold on.

139
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,027
Dave, I can't do this.

140
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,730
You have to take chances.

141
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,098
Did that the day I met you.

142
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:42,668
[gentle music]

143
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,839
Shannon, you're just glowing.

144
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:50,710
I don't think I've seen you
like this since you and Rich.

145
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,980
Actually, I don't think I've
ever seen you like this before.

146
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,716
Mom, that's because
Dave is fantastic.

147
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,351
He's so different.

148
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,154
I'm so happy for you, honey.

149
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,422
You and dad like
him, don't you?

150
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,991
Oh, yes, we think
Dave is just great.

151
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,727
And we think the two of
you are a great couple.

152
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,262
You know, I don't know
what it is about him.

153
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,098
He's-- he's fun and exciting.

154
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:17,036
And when I'm with him,
everything is more--

155
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,739
more whatever it is
in the first place.

156
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,809
Do you love him?

157
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,076
Yeah.

158
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,846
I think I do, Mom.

159
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,247
I think you do, too.

160
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,615
I mean, he's lived a life.

161
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:32,318
You know, he's--
he's so much more

162
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:35,788
mature and together than the
guys I've been going out with.

163
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,491
Can I tell you something else?

164
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,760
Of course.

165
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,629
Well, not that it matters
because I would love

166
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:47,733
him anyway, but he's rich, too.

167
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,403
[laughs]

168
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:54,540
Listen, you let this one
get away and you're nuts.

169
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,441
Don't worry, Mom.

170
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,376
I won't.

171
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,511
Oh.

172
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,346
[door bell]

173
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,449
Oh, he's here.

174
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:04,650
Hey, come on in.

175
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,718
Thanks.

176
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,053
Girls are in the kitchen.
How's the farm?

177
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,221
Well, it's that
time of the year.

178
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,222
It's real busy.

179
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,924
300 acres, 320,
but who's counting.

180
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,860
[laughs]

181
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,795
Oh, carnations.

182
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:16,829
They are beautiful.

183
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,364
I told him if
he keeps this up,

184
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,800
I'm going to have to start
buying flowers for your mother.

185
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,701
She deserves them.

186
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:22,935
Hi, Mrs. Moore.

187
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:26,172
Cille, you know me well
enough now to call me Cille,

188
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,807
just like everybody else does.

189
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:28,708
Here, let me take these.

190
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:29,609
I'll put them in a vase.

191
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:30,610
And you all go in sit down.

192
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,611
All right.

193
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,381
OK.

194
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,249
Here we go.

195
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,750
Oh, honey, this is delicious.

196
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,918
I love this pie.

197
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,020
And here's yours, darling.

198
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,723
Thank you.

199
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:48,261
Ah, Shannon and I have
something to tell you.

200
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:52,198
Well, tell away.

201
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,133
I love your daughter.

202
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,269
I guess you already know that.

203
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,038
But the farm has a lot
of work for one man

204
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,573
and with the crops
about to come in,

205
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:04,143
it's getting harder and
harder to get into Toledo.

206
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:09,615
It just seems the sensible thing
for us to do is to get married.

207
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,616
You knew.

208
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,524
Daddy, we know
it's the right thing.

209
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:21,394
Honey, you just met not
more than two months ago.

210
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,530
That's long enough to know
that I love your daughter.

211
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,032
Dave, it's not long enough.

212
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,567
You might be
infatuated with her,

213
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,702
but you haven't known her
long enough to be in love.

214
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:30,937
It takes time to be in love.

215
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,004
Just calm down, Bob.

216
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,739
You don't have to
tell me to calm down.

217
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,575
Honey, we didn't
know each other very

218
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,677
well before we got married.

219
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,546
And that's lasted a lifetime.

220
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,582
Mr. Moore, if
Shannon and I have

221
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,918
half the marriage that you and
Cille have, we'll have it made.

222
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:49,355
And I'll do everything
I can to make it happen.

223
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:54,193
I have never in my life felt
the way I feel about Shannon.

224
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,729
This is forever.

225
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,664
He's right, Daddy.

226
00:09:58,764 --> 00:09:59,665
And you like Dave.

227
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,833
You said so the first
day you met him.

228
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,335
Why are you trying to
make him feel bad now?

229
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,869
I just can't get used to it.

230
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,137
That's all.

231
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,273
I know, you think you're
losing Shannon, but you're not.

232
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,407
We'll see you.

233
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:09,942
We'll have you out to
the farm all the time.

234
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:17,683
And I hope I won't embarrass
you telling you this,

235
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:22,788
but since I lost my
father in World War II,

236
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,124
I'd like you to be the
father that I never had.

237
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,960
[clock ticking]

238
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,735
Well, you do look
happy together.

239
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,903
Never happier.

240
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:41,173
Daddy, this is what I want.

241
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:44,410
Honey, you're a big girl.

242
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:49,048
I guess, I should welcome
Dave to the family.

243
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,349
- Thank you, sir.
- OK.

244
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:51,417
Thank you, Daddy.

245
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:52,418
All right.

246
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,191
Well, we're going to have to
get to work on this wedding.

247
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,894
Oh, we're going to save you
the trouble and the expense.

248
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,362
It's no trouble.

249
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:07,233
Mom, Dave has
always wanted to be

250
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,235
married in one of those
picturesque, little chapels

251
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,270
in Las Vegas.

252
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,705
Las Vegas?

253
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:15,241
But how would everybody
get to Las Vegas?

254
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,711
Mom, I know we've waited
all my life for this,

255
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,313
but Dave and I are so in love.

256
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,082
And it just feels right.

257
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,886
I don't want to wait another
minute to be Shannon's husband.

258
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,688
I'm sorry.

259
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:32,425
We'll have a big
celebration when we get back.

260
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,726
[slow music]

261
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:37,396
Well, if you really
want to do this

262
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:43,636
and if you've thought
about it, then I guess you

263
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:44,870
better just go ahead and do it.

264
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,873
[slow music]

265
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:48,774
Thanks.

266
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,311
[slow music]

267
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,116
Almost there.

268
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,089
How's it feel being
Mrs. Shannon Davis?

269
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:10,596
I feel like the luckiest
girl in the world.

270
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:14,066
How do you feel finally
getting married?

271
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,035
I waited for just
the right woman.

272
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,971
That's how I feel.

273
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,106
Tell me about the others.

274
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:24,810
[laughs] My life
began when I met you.

275
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,347
[slow music]

276
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:46,365
This is ours, 100 acres of
prime Michigan farmland.

277
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:47,900
I thought you said 300.

278
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,802
I did, but I'm
just farming 100.

279
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,137
Dick-- Dick Britton,
my neighbor,

280
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,172
I'm letting him farm the rest.

281
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,841
That's what's left of the
trailer burned down last year.

282
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:56,909
Oh, I'm sorry.

283
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:57,877
Don't be.

284
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,045
Insurance paid more
than it's worth.

285
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,313
That was lucky.

286
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:02,782
Luck had nothing
to do with it.

287
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,650
I insure everything.

288
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,553
The house, me, you, even the
car payments are insured.

289
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,021
If something happens
to me, you won't

290
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,123
have anything to worry about.

291
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:14,560
Except I couldn't live if
something happened to you.

292
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,828
Nothing's going
to happen to me.

293
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:16,729
Guaranteed.

294
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,932
[slow music]

295
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,302
Be it ever so humble.

296
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:57,736
I know, it doesn't
look like much.

297
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,240
It's only temporary.

298
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,645
Honey, I don't
care what it looks

299
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:07,880
like as long as we're together.

300
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,748
As soon as the
economy picks up,

301
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,517
I'm going to sell some property.

302
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,752
And we're going to
fix this place up.

303
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,887
You know, we
could do that right

304
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,856
now without spending anything.

305
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,091
It's all going
to have to wait.

306
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,292
I've got something for you.

307
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,828
Come on.

308
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:26,332
[slow music]

309
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,302
Wow.

310
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,871
I just had them delivered
before we got here.

311
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,039
They're beautiful, huh?

312
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,075
I don't really ride.

313
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,409
Well, you will now.

314
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,777
You know what they say?

315
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,512
Nothing so good for
the inside of a person

316
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,414
is the outside of a horse.

317
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:43,549
Just think about it.

318
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,017
Come on now.

319
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:48,087
[slow music]

320
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:53,225
That a girl.

321
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,126
Oh, Dave.

322
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,496
It's going to be OK.

323
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:58,530
Don't worry.

324
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,099
He's real gentle.
We'll take it easy.

325
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,200
What do I do?

326
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,501
You just give him a
little kick, like this.

327
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,704
[slow music]

328
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:14,280
Well, I was Dave Davis's
neighbor, sold him his farm.

329
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,180
I like Dave.

330
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,283
I wanted to see him do well.

331
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:21,287
He used to come over and
help me doing harvest time.

332
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,689
Me and my wife Annie
were so happy for him

333
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,358
when he brought Shannon home.

334
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,927
She was a sweetest thing.

335
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,096
And she loved him.

336
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,866
He'd be telling
one of his stories.

337
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,402
And she'd just be
hanging on every word.

338
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,771
So the next thing I
know, I'm walking point

339
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,240
and then, boom, landmine.

340
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,508
Oh, my god, Dave.

341
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,077
I saw men step on
the things, you

342
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,312
couldn't even find the pieces.

343
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,746
No, this is a
Viet Cong sapper.

344
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:48,681
They had them all over.

345
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,682
They're not very powerful.

346
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,083
I mean they chew you
up enough though.

347
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:52,084
I'll show you.

348
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,025
Yeah, I was lucky.

349
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:04,663
Blew me forward on my stomach.

350
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:12,071
But Billy Gauge, though, it
went straight to his chest.

351
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,707
What happened to him?

352
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:20,145
Well, he died and right--
right there in my arms.

353
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,680
So we stopped to bury him.

354
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,583
About halfway through the job, I
get pinned down by sniper fire.

355
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,752
The rest of my company
splits off into the jungle.

356
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,722
I ended up spending the
night in that damn grave,

357
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,458
right next to Billy.

358
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,493
Next morning, I'm laying there.

359
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:35,394
I'm real still.

360
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,795
[intense music]

361
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,630
I hear footsteps.

362
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,032
I look up.

363
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,500
And there's a Cong looking down.

364
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,669
And the last thing he
ever saw was me shooting

365
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,604
him right between the eyes.

366
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,139
Oh, my lord.

367
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,140
How awful.

368
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,913
Well, we're going
to play cards or what?

369
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,048
14 blue.
Hut.

370
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,249
Hut.
Hut.

371
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,083
Hut.
Hey.

372
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,586
[cheerful music]

373
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:01,954
Let's go.

374
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:02,955
Go.

375
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,566
I'm going to pull the
stuff off the barbecue now.

376
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,567
OK.

377
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,369
Hey, guys, we're
getting ready to eat.

378
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:18,303
OK.
Last play.

379
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,304
Last play.

380
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,443
14, 33.

381
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,344
Hut.

382
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,245
Hut.

383
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,213
Hut.

384
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:29,648
Dave.

385
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:30,649
Dave!

386
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,754
The great Michigan
quarterback, Dave Davis,

387
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:36,688
has lost his touch.

388
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,624
Well, I didn't
play quarterback.

389
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,126
I love you anyway.

390
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,295
I'm gonna see if your
dad needs any help, OK?

391
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,196
OK, sweetie.

392
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,532
Shannon, honey,
would you go get

393
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,634
the potato salad out of the
refrigerator for me, please?

394
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,169
Yeah.

395
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,370
Isn't he neat, Mom?

396
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,271
He's neat.

397
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,272
He's neat.

398
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,276
I'll carry the drinks.

399
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,377
Oh, thanks.

400
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,012
It's so good to see
you and Dave so happy.

401
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,749
It never felt that way when
Alana and the kids lived here.

402
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:04,817
Alana?

403
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,152
Yeah, Dave's first wife.

404
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,187
You knew, didn't you?

405
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,124
Oh, yeah, I knew.

406
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,193
I'd forgotten her name.

407
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,428
That's all.

408
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,197
Oh.

409
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,832
[chatter]

410
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,301
Yeah?

411
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,502
Well, you did pretty well.

412
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,837
Yeah.
- First time?

413
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,071
No.
No.

414
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,206
I haven't played in a while.

415
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,275
I visited Dave and
Shannon on the farm a lot.

416
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:35,013
I remember, on my last visit,
it was really weird because

417
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,082
Shannon took me up to her room.

418
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,184
And she told me
that before I make

419
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:43,288
a commitment to someone to be
sure to ask a lot of questions.

420
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:46,692
She told me not to
be gun shy, to ask

421
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:54,399
about extramarital affairs,
previous wives, everything.

422
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,535
We were alone five
minutes before Dave

423
00:18:56,635 --> 00:19:00,005
knocked on the door telling
us to get back to the party.

424
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,240
And she never
brought it up again.

425
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,256
Dick and I are going to
take his tractor over to--

426
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,626
what's wrong?

427
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,762
These aren't mine.

428
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,932
Well, they're sure
as hell not mine.

429
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,902
I want an answer, Dave.

430
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,103
Well, I must--

431
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,471
I must have brought them
home from the laundromat,

432
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:33,872
thinking-- thinking
that they were yours.

433
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:34,873
Are they Alana's?

434
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,245
You have children,
too, don't you?

435
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:45,150
Honey--

436
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,051
Don't.

437
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:48,053
Just don't.

438
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:49,321
How could you?

439
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,301
I didn't want you to know.

440
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:08,307
The way I feel is that you're
the only woman in the world.

441
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:09,274
She didn't exist.

442
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,878
That is not your
decision to make.

443
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:14,146
Well, I'm not perfect.

444
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,486
I want to know about her.

445
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,161
She got pregnant.

446
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,364
We were only
married a few years.

447
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:33,632
We were never in love.

448
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,566
But you have children.

449
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,801
And you never see them.

450
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,569
She won't let me.

451
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,304
She told the judge a
bunch of lies about me.

452
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,506
But you never talk about them.

453
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,175
There are no
pictures around here?

454
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:44,943
It's just too painful.

455
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:48,380
She already took
my kids from me.

456
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,150
Don't let her take
you from me, too.

457
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,352
I love you.

458
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,721
[slow music]

459
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,223
I want to believe you.

460
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:02,995
Then just do it
because it's the truth.

461
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:03,996
And I adore you.

462
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,532
[slow music]

463
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:10,869
Dave, come here.

464
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,905
[slow music]

465
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,721
We saw a lot of
Shannon and Dave.

466
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,923
Most weekends, we'd
drive out from Toledo

467
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,992
and stay at the farm.

468
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,827
And Dave treated
us like royalty.

469
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,829
We thought he was great.

470
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,365
We were so fond of him.

471
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:44,703
Never saw them fight
until that last day.

472
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:48,206
I knew something was wrong.

473
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,442
We must have really
interfered with his plans.

474
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,298
Van going to be
ready for the trip?

475
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:14,866
Well, that's the plan.

476
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:18,503
And I thought-- thought maybe
we'd take the horses out later.

477
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:19,571
I don't think so.

478
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,039
I just saw my folks
at the gas station.

479
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:22,407
They're right behind me.

480
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:26,345
Shannon, you know we've got
things to do besides entertain

481
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:27,346
your mom and dad.

482
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:33,919
Hamburgers OK for dinner?

483
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,776
You didn't tell
me they were coming.

484
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,445
You didn't tell me I had
to clear everything with you.

485
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,147
Besides, you like my parents.

486
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,549
Well, not every
weekend, not this weekend.

487
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:05,851
They're only
staying one night.

488
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,486
Mom's got a ceramics class
or something in the morning.

489
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,287
We're trying to
leave for Florida.

490
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,355
Damn!

491
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,324
Exactly, which makes
this our last chance

492
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:13,725
to see them before we go.

493
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:26,972
Hello, Dave.

494
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:27,973
Dave?

495
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:34,913
I'll go find Shannon.

496
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:37,983
OK.

497
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:41,286
Hello?

498
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:46,992
Shannon.

499
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,760
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

500
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,595
Oh, honey.

501
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:51,930
Honey, what's wrong?

502
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:52,998
Nothing.

503
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,801
Something's wrong, Shannon.

504
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,569
Just don't go, OK?

505
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:58,570
Oh, honey.

506
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,744
Cille, I think we're
interrupting something.

507
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,680
I was just explaining to Bob,
we have an awful lot of work

508
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,315
to do to get ready for our trip.

509
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,083
Dave, we don't even
have to stay overnight.

510
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,553
Maybe we'll stay for dinner
and then be on our way.

511
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,688
Maybe another weekend,
it'll be better.

512
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,290
Can we take a rain check?

513
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:24,029
I think we should
stay the night.

514
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,199
It's an awful long
drive in the dark.

515
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,000
Shannon and I, we
were going to take

516
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,335
the horses out before dinner.

517
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:34,372
I thought we
had so much to do.

518
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,041
Shannon, I think
we need to talk?

519
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,411
Do you mind?

520
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,648
No, you two go ahead.

521
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:44,649
I'll make dinner.

522
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:54,826
Look, let's not fight.

523
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,095
You've just been
acting so strange.

524
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,664
Everything's a big
secret with you.

525
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,266
Look, I'm still not
used to getting married.

526
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:03,101
And I know, I've been
stressed out over this trip.

527
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:04,569
Well, you don't have
to take it out on me.

528
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,737
I don't mean to.

529
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,406
All I want to do is make
things good for you.

530
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,009
I'm sorry.

531
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,879
I just want it the way
it was supposed to be.

532
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:17,148
We need some time alone.

533
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,084
This ride's going to be good.

534
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,452
Believe me, it's
just what we need.

535
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:23,955
[slow music]

536
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:28,126
Come on, babe.

537
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:29,027
Let's go.

538
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:31,997
[slow music]

539
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:54,452
[intense music]

540
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:08,333
Dick!

541
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:11,236
Dick!

542
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,772
Oh, Dick!

543
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:14,906
What the hell is he doing?

544
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,149
- Dick, you've got to help me.
- Oh, my god, Dave.

545
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,650
What's happened?
- Shannon had an accident.

546
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,052
- Andy, call an ambulance now.
- Your car.

547
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,086
Your car.
- All right.

548
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:28,787
- No time.
- All right.

549
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:29,688
No time.

550
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,990
[intense music]

551
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,267
There she is,
between those trees.

552
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:43,168
Slow down.

553
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,169
Slow down.

554
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:54,279
She still got a
pulse, but it's weak.

555
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,580
Let's put her in
the back of your car

556
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,815
and take her to Willow Point.

557
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,083
Dave, Willow
Point's too small.

558
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:00,452
They're not having a
yard doctor on the job.

559
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:01,720
There's sure to be
one in Hillsboro.

560
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,054
No, Willow Point is closer.

561
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,789
They've got a breathing machine.
That's what she needs now.

562
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:05,690
Dave!

563
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,625
She's my wife!

564
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:09,427
[intense music]

565
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,865
[honking]

566
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:24,542
[honking]

567
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,510
Come on.

568
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,480
Over here.

569
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,315
She's not breathing.

570
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:31,916
Get a gurney and an ambu bag.

571
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,284
No, she needs a respirator.

572
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:36,521
Get out of the car.

573
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:37,422
She's my wife.

574
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:38,323
You have to help her.

575
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:39,758
You have to let us do our job.

576
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,393
Please just let
us bring her down.

577
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,361
You've got to help her.

578
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:44,696
You've got to help her.

579
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:45,597
I saw them coming in.

580
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:46,998
What have you got?

581
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,333
25-year-old female.

582
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:49,234
No pulse.

583
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,636
No respiration.

584
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:52,904
You're just going
to get in the way.

585
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,139
Give them a chance.

586
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,708
I want some atropine and
some epinephrine on board.

587
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,543
Get the crash cart STAT.

588
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:01,780
Get the EKG in here quickly now.

589
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,314
Can I call her parents, Dave?

590
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,984
Oh, god, Dick.

591
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,253
They need to know.

592
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,320
Now, I'll call them.

593
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,089
Do you have a phone number?

594
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,058
They're back at the house.

595
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,093
Your house?

596
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:15,994
All right.

597
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,829
Look, I'll be right here, Dave.

598
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,964
I'm just going to call
Shannon's parents.

599
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,502
Come on.

600
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:25,403
Come on.

601
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:27,305
Come on.

602
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:28,807
Come on.
Come on.

603
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:29,808
Come on.

604
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:34,679
It's been 15 minutes.

605
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:37,982
[somber music]

606
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:45,156
All right, everybody.

607
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,625
Let's call it.

608
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,360
Let's put down 3:45.

609
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,096
She didn't get in till 4:15.

610
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:51,996
DOA.

611
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:55,266
[somber music]

612
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:11,649
We've done all we can
do, all anyone can do.

613
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,819
I'm sorry.

614
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,054
She can't be dead.

615
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:19,524
She can't be.

616
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:20,425
We couldn't save her.

617
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:22,694
It was too late.

618
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,429
She talked to me.

619
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,364
She told me it was OK.

620
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:31,269
[cries]

621
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,138
Do you want someone to look
after those scratches, Mr.

622
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,139
Davis?

623
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:40,211
I'll leave you alone.

624
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:43,615
I'm here if you
want to talk later.

625
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:44,716
[sobbing].

626
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:08,339
Excuse me.

627
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:09,340
Are you Mr. Davis?

628
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,611
I'm Deputy Glassman
from the Hillsboro

629
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:14,979
County Sheriff's Department.

630
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:18,349
This is my partner,
Deputy Alvarez.

631
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:21,653
I realize this is a very
difficult time for you.

632
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:24,422
But we're required to take a
statement about what happened.

633
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:25,623
Can we do this now?

634
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:32,163
I understand it's a
horseback-riding accident.

635
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:35,500
Maybe you can just begin by
telling us what happened.

636
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:45,610
Well, we started down a small
trail, the brush was thick.

637
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,979
I heard Shannon scream.

638
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,682
[screams]

639
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,952
DAVE (VOICEOVER): Somehow,
she fell off of her horse.

640
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:57,021
I'm first-aid trained.

641
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,657
I examined the wound.

642
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:04,162
She had a good, strong pulse
I was thinking that I was

643
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,564
going to have to
go get help, but I

644
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:07,665
didn't want to leave her here.

645
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,503
She was conscious by
the time I dragged

646
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:15,607
her to the edge of the woods.

647
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,175
But she couldn't get up.

648
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:22,580
Dave, go get help.

649
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,948
I can't leave
you here, Shannon.

650
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:24,849
You've got to.

651
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:27,719
[somber music]

652
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,523
I rode through the
woods just as fast

653
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,292
as I could to get to Dick's.

654
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:38,763
And that's-- that's how
I got these scratches.

655
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:41,332
Shannon's folks are here.

656
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:42,967
Would you?

657
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,803
We're just about
down here anyway.

658
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:49,507
Did you have insurance on
your wife's life, Mr. Davis?

659
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:50,408
Insurance?

660
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,243
No.

661
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,344
OK.

662
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:54,245
Thank you.

663
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:57,115
[somber music]

664
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,320
Dick, is she
gonna be all right?

665
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,489
Tell me she's alive, Dick.

666
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,724
I can't do that, Bob.

667
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:08,159
Oh, no.

668
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,427
I have to see her, Dick.

669
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,729
I have to see her.

670
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:12,630
I know, Cille.

671
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,934
[somber music]

672
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:18,569
Oh, Dave.

673
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,371
She's gone.

674
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:22,974
She's gone.

675
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:24,442
Oh.

676
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:27,545
[intense music]

677
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,090
(VOICES ECHOING) I'm so sorry.

678
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,058
What happened?

679
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:41,559
We went on a ride.

680
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:43,027
And Shannon took a fall.

681
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,228
She fell off the horse?

682
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,630
She hit her head.

683
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,764
Hey, doc.

684
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,500
Can I maybe get the, uh,
stats on Shannon Davis.

685
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,737
Cause of death?

686
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:54,038
What's the matter?

687
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,340
Something's wrong, Shannon.

688
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,275
Just don't leave, OK?

689
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,309
Oh, honey.

690
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:03,748
Shannon wants to be cremated.

691
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:04,816
Cremated?

692
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:05,717
No.

693
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,751
No, Dave.

694
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:07,986
You can't cremate my daughter.

695
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,420
I told you that's she wanted.

696
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,321
No.

697
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:11,389
No, Dave, you can't do that.

698
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,657
She's Catholic.

699
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:14,993
Shannon and I have talked
about this several times.

700
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:17,595
She said that when she died,
she wanted to be cremated.

701
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:20,531
No, Shannon would
never have said that.

702
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:21,833
She wouldn't want
to be cremated.

703
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,267
I'm her husband.

704
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:25,436
And I'm going to see that
she gets what she wanted.

705
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:26,771
- Dave, I won't let you do this.
- What?

706
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:27,972
You can't stop me.

707
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:29,707
I'll get a judge if I have to.

708
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:30,942
Is everything OK?

709
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,710
Dave, give her
back to her parents.

710
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:33,945
You've only had
her for 10 months.

711
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:35,380
Let her go.

712
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,082
Dave, is it-- is it
the money for the burial?

713
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,786
What about insurance?

714
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:44,522
I think there was
a small insurance

715
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:47,525
policy that the
hospital had given her.

716
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:50,161
But your-- your name was
on it as the beneficiary.

717
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:51,562
We'll pay for the funeral.

718
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:54,665
We'll pay for the plot if
the money's the problem.

719
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:58,236
But please, please, Dave,
let us take her back

720
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:01,372
and bury her in Toledo, please.

721
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:03,107
All right.

722
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,109
All right.

723
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,413
But I want the casket
closed at that funeral.

[somber music]

725
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:21,959
All right, Bob.

726
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,095
Listen to me, honey.

727
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:27,298
Something's not right here.

728
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,367
Shannon told me that he took
out a big policy on her right

729
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,102
after the marriage.

730
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:33,604
Why would he lie about that now?

731
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:36,607
Why would he lie about that?

732
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:37,775
[cries]

733
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:40,645
[somber music]

734
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:46,184
I didn't think Dave
should be alone that night,

735
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:50,521
so I made him come home with me.

736
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:51,656
We sat up for a while.

737
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,892
And then he went to bed.

738
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:57,328
I was too upset to sleep.

739
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,031
Me and Annie had a
good cry that night.

740
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:01,732
We just liked Shannon so much.

741
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:05,670
It's what happened
the next morning

742
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,106
that made me feel like I'd
been run over by a truck.

743
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:11,609
[music playing]

744
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,080
Morning, Dave.

745
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:16,981
Morning, Dick.

746
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:19,684
[music playing]

747
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:34,132
You know, does Ralph Weston
still want to sell his farm?

748
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:37,635
My god, Dave, how can you talk
about real estate on the day

749
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:38,669
after your wife died?

750
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,576
Forget it.

751
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:49,247
I guess, I'm just trying to
keep my mind off this thing.

752
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:53,818
Thanks for the coffee, Dick.

753
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:57,421
[music playing]

754
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,902
What are you doing, Cille?

755
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,003
It won't come out.

756
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:14,472
I keep washing but it
just won't come out.

757
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:16,807
Even if it did, it
wouldn't bring her back.

758
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,342
I just keep thinking,
if this will come out,

759
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,811
then I'm going to stop
all those terrible things

760
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,780
I'm thinking about Dave.

761
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,848
But it won't come out.

762
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:25,683
Put it away, Cille.

763
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:28,886
This is Shannon's blood, Bob.

764
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:29,787
This means something.

765
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:32,623
[music playing]

766
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:35,860
What is this?

767
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,129
Dave dropped it off for
Shannon to be buried in.

768
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:41,232
[music playing]

769
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:50,575
Ugh, Shannon wouldn't want
to be buried in this old thing.

770
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:54,212
I guess Dave picked it out.

771
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,948
My little girl is going to
spend eternity in something.

772
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,017
It's not going to be this.

773
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:02,553
Mr. Davis said that he
carried her from the woods.

774
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:03,721
Where do you think
that would be?

775
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:05,223
Well, over in this area here.

776
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:12,930
This must be the place where she
hit her head, don't you think?

777
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,098
Probably.

778
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:18,402
Now, do you need to
take samples or anything?

779
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,204
What would you like us
to prove, Mr. Britton?

780
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:21,138
That it's blood?

781
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,340
That it belongs
to Shannon Moore?

782
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,108
I don't think there's
any doubt about that.

783
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,380
Here are her shoes.

784
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,715
Oh, Annie, don't
pick those up.

785
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:34,485
Hon, they may need
them for evidence.

786
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,686
Now, they're untied.

787
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:37,622
You can go ahead and
pick them up, ma'am.

788
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,057
I don't think we'll need them
to file an accident report.

789
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,996
You got what you need?

790
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,197
OK.

791
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:47,565
Well, thank you very much
for your help, folks.

792
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:48,899
Look at these marks.

793
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,603
Now, doesn't it look like
somebody tied up a horse here?

794
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:55,973
Mr. Britton, I appreciate
this woman was your friend,

795
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:57,508
but accidents happen.

796
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,744
I'm sorry.

797
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,846
Thank you for your time, folks.

798
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,180
Annie, you go ahead
and take them back.

799
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,484
[music playing]

800
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,637
Cille, I want you to
know that everything's

801
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:27,905
going to be taken care of.

802
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:30,107
We will do everything
that we can.

803
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:31,676
How's Bob?

804
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:34,111
Oh, he's not very
well, I'm afraid.

805
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:35,112
Please sit.

806
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:41,285
I want Shannon to
be buried in this.

807
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,054
Of course.

808
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,756
Is there anything else I can do?

809
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:47,458
Yes.

810
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:49,627
When they bring the
body in, I'd like you

811
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,729
to look under her fingernails.

812
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,665
See if there's any evidence
of Shannon's having

813
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:56,934
clawed or scratched somebody.

814
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:57,835
I'm sorry, Cille.

815
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:59,403
It's too late for that.

816
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,771
Why too late?

817
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:03,874
The body's already here,
been embalmed, and cleaned.

818
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:09,313
Well, how could they have
finished the autopsy so soon?

819
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:10,414
There was no autopsy.

820
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,417
[music playing]

821
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:25,096
Shannon Moore Davis lived
her life with a sweetness that

822
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,566
left its mark on everyone here.

823
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:31,302
As we commend her
body to the ground,

824
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:37,441
realize her spirit dwells
in each and every one of us.

825
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,410
May the Lord welcome
Shannon on her journey

826
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:44,248
to the table of Gods
children in heaven with faith

827
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:47,218
and hope in eternal peace.

828
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:50,721
Let us assist her now
with a silent prayer.

829
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:54,291
[gentle music]

830
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,168
Aunt Cille.

831
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:05,169
Hi, Teresa.

832
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,741
Dave.

833
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:15,379
Dave, we're just so sorry.

834
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:17,748
I really appreciate
having friends like you.

835
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:19,884
Shannon and I were very lucky.

836
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,419
Excuse me.

837
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,821
Mrs. Warrick, I'm sorry.

838
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,692
I'm-- I'm curious.

839
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:30,327
Do you know when the
death certificate

840
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,530
will become available?

841
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,598
Well, that usually happens
within a couple of weeks.

842
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:35,533
It's a paperwork thing.

843
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:36,434
But it won't be long.

844
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:37,568
Would you do me a favor?

845
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:39,370
Would you please let me
know when you have it?

846
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,938
I'd like to have a copy.

847
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,072
Of course.

848
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,073
Thank you.

849
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:46,644
Thank you, Mark.

850
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,546
Thank you very much.

851
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:49,447
Mr. Moore.

852
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:50,514
Yes.

853
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,817
I'm Jane Thomas,
Dave's mother.

854
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,318
Oh, please.
Sit down.

855
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:55,219
Thank you.

856
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:56,854
It's so nice to meet you.

857
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,990
Not under these
circumstances I'm sure.

858
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:02,026
I'm so sorry.

859
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,463
They've told me what a
wonderful girl Shannon was.

860
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:06,697
Thank you.

861
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,532
I don't want to
disturb your wife,

862
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,135
but please tell
her how sorry I am.

863
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:14,004
And-- and sorry that they
never had a wedding where

864
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:16,006
we all could have met earlier.

865
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:20,211
Dave worshipped Shannon.

866
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,446
I just don't know how
he's going to handle this.

867
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:23,614
Yes.

868
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:27,351
After all the other
things he's been through.

869
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:28,686
How's that?

870
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,921
Well, you know, the
Vietnam and friends

871
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:33,457
of his dying in his arms.

872
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,259
Vietnam?

873
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,393
There must be some mistake.

874
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,664
What do you mean?

875
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:43,300
He was never in Vietnam.

876
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,802
The Marines?

877
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:46,136
No, not the Marines either.

878
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:53,644
Just after the
funeral, a group of us

879
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:57,882
went to dinner to get
our minds off of it.

880
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:00,684
Dave ordered
Margaritas and nachos.

881
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:04,488
And when the drinks came,
he made a toast to Shannon.

882
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:08,559
It was really bad.

883
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:13,964
It went-- it went
something like to my loving

884
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:21,171
wife, who is now smiling down on
us, I wouldn't change a thing.

885
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:22,840
I just wish that she
could have cooked better.

886
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,676
[music playing]

887
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:38,689
Hey, babe, it's me.

888
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,591
Papers are saying
that girl's dead, Dave.

889
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:42,159
What's going on?

890
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:45,195
She's as alive as you and me.

891
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:47,064
Dave, she fell off
a horse and died.

892
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:48,699
It's here in black and white.

893
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:50,467
You ought to know better
than to believe everything

894
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,535
you read in the papers.

895
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:53,270
What are you telling me, Dave?

896
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,072
What are you telling me?

897
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:58,208
This woman has a
new name, a new house,

898
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:01,512
someone new to watch over her.

899
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,847
So your job is over now?

900
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:06,917
I'm packing for a little
R&R in the Florida sun.

901
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:07,952
I want to come with you.

902
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:08,852
Why not?

903
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:11,789
[intense music]

904
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:15,826
Cille, I just got off the
phone with the funeral parlor.

905
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,394
Dave's just coming
up the sidewalk.

906
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:18,362
Listen to me, Cille.

907
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:19,964
The lady at the
funeral parlor said

908
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,999
that six separate
insurance companies called.

909
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,767
They want to see copies
of the death certificates.

910
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:24,969
What do we say to him now?

911
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:26,003
Nothing.

912
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,204
We don't want him to
know that we know.

913
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:28,105
All right.

914
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:31,275
[knocking]

915
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:43,854
What's wrong?

916
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,790
I've had a bad day.

917
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,692
I'm sure you
understand that, Dave?

918
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:54,932
These are some things I'm sure
Shannon would want you to have.

919
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,400
You can come out to the
house later and look

920
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,801
around after I get back.

921
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:00,104
Oh, you're going someplace?

922
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:02,006
I just got to get out of here.

923
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:03,140
I'm sure you do.

924
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,078
I'll be in the desert.

925
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:09,380
Don't know where.

926
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:14,051
I'm just going to keep
driving, trying to heal.

927
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:21,925
Well, I guess that's it.

928
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:25,496
Dave, how do we reach
you if we want to--

929
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:26,830
Well, you can't.

930
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,767
There are no phones
in the desert.

931
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:33,370
[music playing]

932
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:46,950
Jerri!

933
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:47,851
Jerri!

934
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:49,987
[music playing]

935
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:54,792
Did you get your errand done?

936
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:55,693
Oh, fine.

937
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:56,593
No problem.

938
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:57,761
Great.

939
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:58,762
Oh.

940
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:03,267
I can't wait to get to Florida.

941
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,168
Me neither.

942
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:06,970
[music playing]

943
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:10,841
Well, I'd really like
to help you, Mrs. Moore.

944
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:14,445
But there are no laws against
travel in this country.

945
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,814
But there's laws
against murder.

946
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,115
Yes, there are, Mr. Moore.

947
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,216
Well, he murdered
our daughter.

948
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:20,317
Now he's trying to run away.

949
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:21,952
Don't you understand that?

950
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,555
You think so anyway.

951
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:27,191
What about all the
insurance policies?

952
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:28,625
I've already
checked into that.

953
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,128
He stands to get over $300,000.

954
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,097
Yes, and he lied about them.

955
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:36,100
Which makes the man
guilty of lying, Mrs. Moore.

956
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,202
It doesn't make him
guilty of homicide.

957
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:40,671
Tell me, Detective, what
the hell does it take?

958
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,742
Well, first you have
to prove that a murder

959
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:47,511
was even committed.

960
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:49,780
Your daughter's death
was ruled an accident.

961
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,915
But they'd know that
that wasn't the truth

962
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:54,184
if they did an autopsy.

963
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:57,721
Maybe, but they didn't.

964
00:45:57,821 --> 00:46:00,791
Detective, I want you
to understand something.

965
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:02,059
A mother knows.

966
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:04,995
[phone ringing]

967
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:10,834
Well, I don't think you're
going to want to do this,

968
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,236
but there is one
way to settle it.

969
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:21,812
Shannon Davis, that was
her name for eight months.

970
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:24,047
She was Shannon
Moore for 24 years.

971
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:34,958
My name is Donald
Voorhees, Prosecutor

972
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:37,027
for Hillsboro County.

973
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,263
I have reviewed the report
of the autopsy performed

974
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:41,765
on the body of Shannon Davis.

975
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:44,868
I can summarize by saying there
was a single wound at the back

976
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,371
of Mrs. Davis's head
and evidence of bleeding

977
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,340
on the right side of the
brain and that there was

978
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,609
no evidence that Mrs.
Davis had been beaten

979
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:54,778
or of any foul play.

980
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:56,547
In short, the injuries
were consistent

981
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,615
with the initial
information, that she

982
00:46:58,715 --> 00:47:00,751
was thrown from her
horse and that she

983
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:02,686
struck her head on a rock.

984
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:04,621
I am recommending
that the investigation

985
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:06,623
by the Hillsboro County
Sheriff's Department

986
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:09,193
be discontinued.

987
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:11,228
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
that's good enough for me.

988
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,063
The case is closed.

989
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,898
Isn't it true that
Dave Davis stands

990
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:18,335
to collect $330,000 in
insurance if his wife's

991
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:19,436
death is ruled an accident?

992
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,708
I don't think I know you.

993
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:27,110
Billy Bowles,
Detroit Free Press.

994
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:30,047
Mr. Bowles, what
you refer to is

995
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:32,616
circumstantial evidence only.

996
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:35,652
As I've already explained,
the autopsy report

997
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:39,056
states that a crime
has not been committed.

998
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:43,093
Now, if there has been no
crime, I don't really have

999
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,429
to look for suspects now, do I?

1000
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,398
Have you ever even
questioned Mr. Davis?

1001
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:49,800
You people in the
media want to trial

1002
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,835
a case which doesn't exist.

1003
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:55,305
Now, you may not have
thought about this,

1004
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:57,875
but I believe Mr. Davis has
certain rights this department

1005
00:47:57,975 --> 00:47:59,076
has an obligation to protect.

1006
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:00,544
What about Shannon?

1007
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:02,112
What about her rights?

1008
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,981
Mrs. Moore, I know
how you must feel.

1009
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:04,915
Oh, no, you don't.

1010
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:06,483
Nobody knows how we feel.

1011
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:09,086
Look, Mr. Voorhees,
we read this report too.

1012
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:10,220
Let me tell you something.

1013
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,222
I may be a shop steward
for a bunch of painters.

1014
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:14,725
But the way I read it
is that the coroner

1015
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:17,394
can't make a proper
autopsy because Shannon

1016
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:18,695
was already embalmed.

1017
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:21,899
And when that happens, you
can't test for suffocation.

1018
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:24,835
Now what do you have
to say about that?

1019
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:27,137
Well, it's possible that
some mistakes were made.

1020
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,939
But we can only go on
what the experts tell us.

1021
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,073
What experts?

1022
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:32,643
Mrs. Moore, as I'm
trying to explain,

1023
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,679
every citizen has rights,
including Mr. Davis.

1024
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:37,814
You're standing up for him.

1025
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,049
What about Shannon?

1026
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:40,984
She was only 25 years old.

1027
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,719
And she's lying in the ground.

1028
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:45,122
Who's going to stand
up for Shannon?

1029
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:47,991
[reporters shouting]

1030
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,661
[music playing]

1031
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:03,540
Cille, why don't
you come back to bed?

1032
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:06,977
I can't sleep.

1033
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:10,314
[music playing]

1034
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:18,989
Honey, we're doing
everything we possibly can.

1035
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:20,524
But we can't let
this whole thing

1036
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,993
poison our lives like this.

1037
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:23,994
Where will it end?

1038
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,832
It'll end when that
killer is behind bars.

1039
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:31,802
[music playing]

1040
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,189
Are you Alana Henderson?

1041
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:53,490
Who are you?

1042
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,959
Billy Bowles with
the Detroit Free Press.

1043
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:57,494
I'm wondering if I
might talk to you

1044
00:49:57,594 --> 00:50:00,330
for a minute about your
ex-husband, Dave Davis.

1045
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,265
I don't have anything
to say about him.

1046
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:04,768
Please go away.

1047
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:06,236
You're an important
part of this story.

1048
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,371
No, I'm not.

1049
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:09,840
Leave my name out of it, please.

1050
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,208
Mrs. Henderson.

1051
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:14,111
Look, Mr. Bowles, I've got a
restraining order against Dave.

1052
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:16,880
If I have to, I can
get one against you.

1053
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,749
You won't need that.

1054
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:22,352
I mean, I'll leave
right now if you want.

1055
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:24,688
But my editors are going to make
me write this article anyway.

1056
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:30,527
I feel terrible about
that girl and her family.

1057
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:31,428
I can tell you that.

1058
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:32,796
Is that enough?

1059
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:36,266
Did you ever have reason to
believe that Dave was violent?

1060
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,068
You mean, other than
when he was hitting me?

1061
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,205
I'll try not to take long.

1062
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:57,621
You said he hit you?

1063
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,523
I was raised Catholic.

1064
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:00,891
I was determined to
stay in the marriage,

1065
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,560
no matter how bad it got.

1066
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:08,865
One day, Dave came up behind
me and hit me blindside.

1067
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:14,104
When I came to, he said you're
lucky you're still alive.

1068
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:15,372
That's when I filed for divorce.

1069
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:28,351
Miss Hobson?

1070
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:29,686
Look, if you're the
man from the paper,

1071
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:31,021
I don't have anything
to say to you.

1072
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:33,023
I just need to
ask a few questions.

1073
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:34,491
Following the death of
Shannon Moore Davis,

1074
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,193
did you go to Florida
with David Davis?

1075
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:37,260
You don't know the real story.

1076
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,395
Why don't you report that?

1077
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:39,863
Is David Davis in town now?

1078
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:41,631
I have nothing to say to you.

1079
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:42,699
Is that his van?

1080
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:44,101
Look, she doesn't
have anything to say.

1081
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:45,302
Didn't you hear?

1082
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:46,970
Do you have anything
to say, Mr. Davis?

1083
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,405
If I have a statement,
I'll call you.

1084
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:49,639
Did you kill your wife?

1085
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:51,341
Why don't you call my
lawyer and get your foot out

1086
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:52,509
of my door, or
I'll do it for you.

1087
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,077
I thought this was
Miss Hobson's house.

1088
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:04,321
Davis had been invited
to speak to high school

1089
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:06,957
students about the Vietnam War.

1090
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:09,826
He described what it's like
to watch men die in combat.

1091
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:13,263
And he broke down and cried.

1092
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:14,731
According to the
Defense Department,

1093
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:18,602
Dave Davis was never in the
service and never in Vietnam.

1094
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:21,505
Several of Davis's friends
now say they felt sorry

1095
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:24,174
for him because of
his many tragedies,

1096
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:26,076
orphaned as an infant,
wounded in war,

1097
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:29,179
and blind in a
hospital for a year,

1098
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:32,482
then injured in an
industrial accident.

1099
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:34,084
They had learned
that the stories

1100
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:35,919
Davis told them were untrue.

1101
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:37,754
For Gods sake,
Dave, don't you have

1102
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:40,090
something to say about this?

1103
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,959
Everything that I told
you about Vietnam is true.

1104
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:45,495
But if you ask the
government, they'll deny it.

1105
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:46,997
I can't tell you
any more about it.

1106
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:47,998
But I was in the Marines.

1107
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:49,599
Don't lie to me, Dave.

1108
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:51,401
You lied to me enough already.

1109
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:52,769
I've never lied to you.

1110
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:55,272
You can ask me about anything.

1111
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:58,008
The insurance
policies, I heard you

1112
00:52:58,108 --> 00:52:59,309
say that you didn't have any.

1113
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:01,511
And now it turns out
you have six of them.

1114
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:04,147
I thought they were talking
about health insurance.

1115
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:07,184
And about the life insurance,
I didn't even know I had any.

1116
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:11,121
I was confused about what
double indemnity meant.

1117
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:13,089
I was in shock.

1118
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,124
What about your father?

1119
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:15,659
You said he died in
World War two II.

1120
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:18,261
And it says right here,
he lives in Michigan.

1121
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,663
They're right.

1122
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:23,767
The man listed on those papers
as my father lives in Michigan.

1123
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,203
But that's not my
biological father.

1124
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:29,906
The man I think of as my father
got my mother pregnant on leave

1125
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:31,174
but never came home.

1126
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:32,242
I'm sorry, Dave.

1127
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:34,010
I'm just not buying
what you're selling.

1128
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:34,978
Don't be so sure.

1129
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:35,979
What do you mean?

1130
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:41,418
Well, I can't live
here anymore, Dick,

1131
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:42,752
not with all this suspicion.

1132
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:44,988
Hell, you're my best friend,
but Shannon's parents

1133
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:47,057
and that reporter have
done such a number on me,

1134
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:48,391
you don't even believe me.

1135
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:49,359
I got work to do.

1136
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:50,360
Dick?

1137
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,565
I was thinking of
selling my farm.

1138
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:58,535
I thought maybe
you'd like to buy it.

1139
00:53:58,635 --> 00:53:59,769
I'll make you a good deal.

1140
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:08,178
Well, I was a little
skeptical when I read the letter

1141
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:10,280
Dick Britton wrote our office.

1142
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:14,184
My first reaction was,
the girl's parents must

1143
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:16,519
have stirred up the locals.

1144
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,321
Another case of
grieving parents who

1145
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,357
couldn't accept their
daughter died in an accident.

1146
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:23,727
This happened sometimes
with grieving parents.

1147
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:25,762
But then I met them.

1148
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:27,897
When they bought
the video camera,

1149
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:29,432
I thought it was a
big waste of money.

1150
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:36,006
But now when I see
Shannon and Dave, I--

1151
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:41,978
Maybe it'll help me understand
why you're so suspicious.

1152
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,285
Do you have any idea
how hot it can get driving

1153
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:50,687
home to Hillsboro from Toledo in
a car without air-conditioning?

1154
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:53,023
Well, I don't know,
but it's pretty sweaty.

1155
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,458
Anyway, we still don't
have air-conditioning,

1156
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:57,827
but it's not a problem anymore.

1157
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:59,863
Look at this.

1158
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,699
[giggles]

1159
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:03,600
Hi, Tom.

1160
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,001
Hi, Cille.

1161
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:07,203
How do you like the car?

1162
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,040
He borrowed $10,000
to buy that car.

1163
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,676
And then he takes out more
life insurance on Shannon,

1164
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:18,014
so that if she dies,
the loan gets paid off.

1165
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:19,749
He now owns that
car free and clear.

1166
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:25,855
Honey, bring the camera over.

1167
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:27,157
I want to say hi to
your mom and dad.

1168
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:28,925
Erica!

1169
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:29,926
Oh.

1170
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:35,732
No, I'm sorry.

1171
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,334
I just can't stand
to watch this.

1172
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,572
What I don't understand
is why would her shoes be

1173
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,774
off if she fell from the horse?

1174
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:47,644
Why would the laces be untied?

1175
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:50,680
Something happened in those
woods that was not an accident.

1176
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:57,053
Detective Brooks,
can you help us?

1177
00:55:57,153 --> 00:55:58,421
We're running out
of people to ask.

1178
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:01,991
I don't know.

1179
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:09,332
But I'm going to try.

1180
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:10,233
Thank you.

1181
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:13,837
[music playing]

1182
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:37,861
Are you Dr. Roger Fulbright?

1183
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:39,929
That's me.

1184
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:41,498
That must make you
the eager, young

1185
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:45,568
detective with the grand
theory about the Davis case.

1186
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:47,170
I've got a theory, yes.

1187
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,539
Well, I'm chained to the
desk for the afternoon,

1188
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:51,775
so let's hear it.

1189
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:52,776
All right.

1190
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:57,080
Davis and his wife were
alone in the woods.

1191
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,382
But he knew he couldn't
repeatedly strike her head

1192
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:00,950
again and again if he
wanted us to believe

1193
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:02,419
she died falling off a horse.

1194
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:05,054
Meaning, you think he only
had one chance to connect

1195
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:06,790
her head with that rock.

1196
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:07,991
He had to be sure
she wasn't going

1197
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,259
to put up much of a fight.

1198
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,628
Therefore, our young
detective theorizes

1199
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:14,898
Davis might have used some
kind of drug to immobilize her.

1200
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:16,232
He took pharmacology classes.

1201
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:17,400
He's a smart guy.

1202
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,302
Wouldn't a smart
guy worry that might

1203
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:20,470
turn up in our lab work?

1204
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:21,871
Not if he thought he
could sell the horse story

1205
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:23,306
and get her cremated right away.

1206
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:35,351
Chemical analysis of
Shannon Moore's tissue.

1207
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,252
What's this?

1208
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:38,321
Could be your drug.

1209
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:39,856
You knew about this all along?

1210
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,991
It also be a fatty acid.

1211
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:45,829
So far, we've eliminated
about 1,000 possibilities out

1212
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,263
of, oh, say, a quarter million.

1213
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:48,331
So keep checking.

1214
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:49,699
It doesn't work that way.

1215
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,968
I don't have the time, the
money, or the equipment

1216
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:53,636
to track this down.

1217
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:55,972
I'm never going to be able
to tell you what it is.

1218
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:57,440
You have to tell me.

1219
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,809
And then I try to verify it.

1220
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:02,312
I have to tell you?

1221
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:06,382
Isn't that why they pay
you the big bucks, Detective?

1222
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,986
[music playing]

1223
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:20,630
Look at him, just look
at him, that son of a--

1224
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:24,801
I want you to go in there,
sit across the table from him,

1225
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:26,236
show him you're
not afraid of him.

1226
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,938
Yeah, well, I'm afraid
of what I might do to him.

1227
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:30,273
He should be on
trial for murder.

1228
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:32,275
Why should I have to sue
him for wrongful death?

1229
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:34,477
If we win this suit, we
keep the insurance money

1230
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:35,945
out of Dave's hands.

1231
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:38,014
The minute he gets
it, he could run.

1232
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:42,685
Whatever we have to do
to get him, for Shannon.

1233
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:47,323
[sighs]

1234
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:49,325
All right now, let me
just try to summarize

1235
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:51,494
some of these things.

1236
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:54,931
Death of your father, playing
football for Bo Shembechler

1237
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:58,401
in the Rose Bowl,
serving in Vietnam,

1238
00:58:58,501 --> 00:59:00,303
growing up in an orphanage.

1239
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:04,307
Now you've admitted lying about
all these things, haven't you?

1240
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:05,742
Apparently so.

1241
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:06,643
Let me ask you something.

1242
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:08,177
Help me out here.

1243
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:13,283
Why tell people something
if it's not true?

1244
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,251
I have no answer.

1245
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:17,854
Your answer is
you have no answer.

1246
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:18,855
That's what he said.

1247
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,993
Let's get back to Shannon.

1248
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:24,928
Did you love her?

1249
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:26,229
Of course.

1250
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:27,697
Of course.

1251
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:29,899
Now, you've told us, you
traveled to Florida two days

1252
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:31,301
after your wife's funeral.

1253
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:34,470
Who did you go with?

1254
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,407
A-- a friend helped
me to drive there.

1255
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:38,775
What was the name
of that friend?

1256
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:43,313
Jerri Hobson.

1257
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,081
Jerri Hobson.

1258
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:47,884
That's a woman's name
though, isn't it?

1259
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:48,851
Yes.

1260
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:50,186
The time it took
traveling to Florida

1261
00:59:50,286 --> 00:59:53,990
involved overnight
stops, did it not?

1262
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:54,958
Yes.

1263
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:56,926
Yes.

1264
00:59:57,026 --> 01:00:00,029
Did you and Jerri Hobson
share a room during that trip?

1265
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:01,431
I don't have to
answer that question.

1266
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:03,666
Oh, Mr. Davis,
I'm afraid you do.

1267
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:07,971
You're sworn as if you were
standing in front of a judge.

1268
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:08,972
Do you want to tell him?

1269
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:15,845
You need to answer it.

1270
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:17,714
The question is, did
you and Jerri Hobson

1271
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:19,716
share a room during
a trip to Florida

1272
01:00:19,816 --> 01:00:21,517
immediately after
your wife's funeral?

1273
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:30,126
Yes.

1274
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:31,494
Son of a bitch.

1275
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:33,396
You never loved
anybody but yourself.

1276
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:35,064
Please, Mr. Moore,
any more outbursts,

1277
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:37,567
you'll have to leave the room.

1278
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:38,968
Let's continue, Mr. Davis.

1279
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:41,270
Let's go back to the
day of the accident.

1280
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:43,806
Did you pull your
wife from her horse

1281
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:45,675
and hit her head against a rock?

1282
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:47,010
No.

1283
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:48,878
Why should we believe you
now, when you've acknowledged

1284
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:50,913
that you've lied in the past?

1285
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:52,281
I didn't kill my wife.

1286
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:54,817
That's why you should believe
me, because I didn't do it.

1287
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:57,253
[intense music]

1288
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:59,355
I didn't do it.

1289
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:09,532
[cheerful music]

1290
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:12,568
[chatter]

1291
01:01:21,611 --> 01:01:22,612
- You're kidding?
- No

1292
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:23,579
You have a satellite phone?

1293
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,349
Yes, I do.

1294
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:28,618
And that's the guy I'm
going to interview.

1295
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:30,286
For your bodyguard company?

1296
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:33,056
Mm-hmm.

1297
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:34,257
He doesn't look that tough.

1298
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,159
Well, looks can be deceiving.

1299
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:37,960
I'll just be a few seconds.

1300
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:41,497
[cheerful music]

1301
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,171
Congratulations.

1302
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:51,240
You're now fully licensed to
drive in the Sunshine State.

1303
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,141
Oh, this is good.

1304
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:53,609
Nothing but the best.

1305
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,845
I also paid for
Social Security.

1306
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:00,583
What's this?

1307
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:01,851
It's a library card.

1308
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:05,188
It's a blue-light bonus special,
just a little insurance.

1309
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:06,923
Oh, you can never
have too much insurance.

1310
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:10,393
[cheerful music]

1311
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:23,206
Detective Brooks,
Michigan State Police.

1312
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:25,875
Do I have to talk to you?

1313
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:27,443
Not yet.

1314
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:28,745
Where's Dave?

1315
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:29,645
Florida.

1316
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:32,348
That's where he lives now.

1317
01:02:32,448 --> 01:02:34,450
Maybe he told you
about his deposition?

1318
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:36,519
That's nothing to do with me.

1319
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:38,321
I think it does.

1320
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,589
You stayed at a motel
with a man whose

1321
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:41,557
wife died three days before.

1322
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:43,760
I'd say that's pretty suspicious
behavior from both of you.

1323
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,695
I had nothing to do
with that woman's death.

1324
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:46,662
I believe you.

1325
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:47,964
But you got to admit
it, it sounds--

1326
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:50,733
Dave told me my
name never came up.

1327
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:54,804
Wouldn't be the first time
he lied to you, would it?

1328
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:56,906
Do you know for a
fact that this Shannon

1329
01:02:57,006 --> 01:03:00,643
Moore wasn't in the
Witness Protection Program?

1330
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:03,146
Is that what he told you?

1331
01:03:03,246 --> 01:03:04,914
Shannon Moore is no witness.

1332
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:08,084
She's the victim.

1333
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:10,653
Well, are you sure
it's really her?

1334
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:12,088
That it's really her body?

1335
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:13,156
It's her.

1336
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:16,659
Whatever he told you, it's her.

1337
01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:18,294
They were really married.

1338
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:19,295
And she's dead.

1339
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:25,001
But Dave works for the
government, doesn't he?

1340
01:03:25,101 --> 01:03:28,037
I mean, he's an
agent or something?

1341
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:29,272
It's one of his
better stories.

1342
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:37,313
God, I've been so stupid.

1343
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:43,786
If I had married
him, I'd be the--

1344
01:03:43,886 --> 01:03:45,488
He talked about marriage?

1345
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:48,090
Almost from the beginning.

1346
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:50,493
Why didn't you marry him?

1347
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:51,494
I wasn't ready.

1348
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:56,032
I mean, he scared me off.

1349
01:03:56,132 --> 01:04:00,102
He still had the rings from the
woman before me who backed out.

1350
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:01,237
It was all too planned.

1351
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:07,577
This woman before you,
you remember her name?

1352
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:08,578
Yeah.

1353
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:13,449
He's in trouble, huh?

1354
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:14,350
He's under investigation.

1355
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:17,153
What's his is background?

1356
01:04:17,253 --> 01:04:18,621
I don't know what
I can tell you.

1357
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:21,290
It's been a few years.

1358
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,593
Dave came and went
a lot from my life.

1359
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:27,296
He's always Tokyo, or
Belize, or something.

1360
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:29,232
You know, he works for the CIA.

1361
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:30,600
Mm-hmm.

1362
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,335
I guess, "worked" is
probably the word now

1363
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:33,336
that he's in this trouble.

1364
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:37,640
Did he ever propose?

1365
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,609
Cappy?

1366
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:41,043
Oh, yeah.

1367
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:42,245
Cappy?

1368
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:46,282
He gave himself a
nickname, Cappy, for Captain.

1369
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:49,018
He thought he was
a big time sailor.

1370
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:50,786
But you didn't marry him?

1371
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,788
Almost did.

1372
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:53,923
We had the tickets.

1373
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:56,826
And I was almost on the
plane when I backed out.

1374
01:04:56,926 --> 01:04:58,494
Where were you
going to get married?

1375
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:00,496
Las Vegas.

1376
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:04,400
He wanted to get married in one
of those tacky, little chapels.

1377
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,837
I just-- I just
couldn't handle that.

1378
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:10,773
Ever remember Dave talking
about drugs, bring up subject?

1379
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:16,913
I know this is what
you're looking for,

1380
01:05:17,013 --> 01:05:20,549
but I remember one time,
this must have been 1978.

1381
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:22,551
He read me an article
about some physician

1382
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:25,354
that F. Lee Bailey defended,
used a drug he said

1383
01:05:25,454 --> 01:05:27,123
was the perfect murder
weapon because after it

1384
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:30,426
kills somebody, it can't
be detected in an autopsy.

1385
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:31,661
He actually told you that?

1386
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:32,995
Oh, yeah.

1387
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:35,965
Dave could get excited about
some pretty unusual things.

1388
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:37,566
He used to read a lot
of murder mysteries.

1389
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:47,143
Try this.

1390
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:55,284
Intact and dioxin chloride,
a pretty good guess for rookie.

1391
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:56,419
Where'd you get this?

1392
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:57,987
A lot of farmers like
Davis have access to it.

1393
01:05:58,087 --> 01:05:58,955
See if it matches.

1394
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:01,324
Oh, it kills people
dead, all right,

1395
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:02,959
paralyzes every
muscle in the body,

1396
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:04,727
so you can't even breathe.

1397
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:06,495
The problem is after
about 10 minutes

1398
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:07,997
it breaks down in human tissue.

1399
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:09,865
So guys like me can't find it.

1400
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:10,766
Sorry.

1401
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:13,235
Try it anyway.

1402
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:15,738
Well, if it will make you
feel better, we'll rule it out.

1403
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:17,506
And then you can
get back to work.

1404
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:19,809
Great.

1405
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:22,578
[music playing]

1406
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:26,916
It'll only take a couple
of minutes to get a reading.

1407
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:29,785
[music playing]

1408
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:48,104
You know this is the one
with dioxin chloride, right?

1409
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:51,607
Now this is the
unknown compound found

1410
01:06:51,707 --> 01:06:55,311
in Shannon Moore's tissues.

1411
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:56,212
Bingo.

1412
01:06:56,312 --> 01:06:58,214
Perfect match.

1413
01:06:58,314 --> 01:07:00,483
I've got to run more
tests to replicate this.

1414
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:03,419
I've got to be able to prove you
can extract dioxinol chloride

1415
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:04,720
from human tissue.

1416
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,323
But if I can, it sure looks
like you've got your man.

1417
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:09,725
This gives me the proof
Shannon Moore was murdered.

1418
01:07:09,825 --> 01:07:13,662
I still got to prove Dave
Davis had access to the drug.

1419
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:16,999
Hey, Detective, good call.

1420
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:19,902
[music playing]

1421
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:26,709
Detective Brooks,
this is my niece Tracy.

1422
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:27,610
Hi, Tracy.

1423
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,245
Hi, Detective.

1424
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:31,247
Honey, you just tell
him what you told us.

1425
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:39,155
Well, there are about a
dozen needles in the butter

1426
01:07:39,255 --> 01:07:40,623
compartment in the fridge.

1427
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:41,757
Hypodermic needles?

1428
01:07:41,857 --> 01:07:44,860
Yeah, I guess Dave used
them for the animals.

1429
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,263
There were also some
vials in the freezer.

1430
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:49,965
You know the kind where
you put the needle

1431
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:51,567
through and pull the drug out?

1432
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:53,769
Do you remember
the name of the drug?

1433
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:55,404
I don't know.

1434
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:57,406
It sounded like penicillin.

1435
01:07:57,506 --> 01:07:59,708
But I guess I'm just not sure.

1436
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:01,610
Take a look.

1437
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:02,645
There are five names here.

1438
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,747
Can you remember one of them?

1439
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:05,848
They look like anyway.

1440
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,856
That one.

1441
01:08:13,956 --> 01:08:14,857
Which one?

1442
01:08:14,957 --> 01:08:19,628
I don't know how
you say it, Pentactin.

1443
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:21,664
OK.

1444
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:24,533
Well, thanks.

1445
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:26,869
Sorry I couldn't
be of more help.

1446
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:27,770
Thanks, Tracy.

1447
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:31,273
[music playing]

1448
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:32,875
I'm sorry it
wasn't that dioxin

1449
01:08:32,975 --> 01:08:36,112
or whatever it is
you were looking for.

1450
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:41,083
There are seven brand
names for dioxinol chloride.

1451
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:44,186
And one of them is Pentactin.

1452
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:47,123
Oh, my god.

1453
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:48,424
You've both been
through so much.

1454
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:51,927
I don't know how
to ask you this.

1455
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:54,730
We need your permission
to exhume Shannon again.

1456
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:58,000
[music playing]

1457
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:01,737
Dave?

1458
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:02,638
Just checking in.

1459
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:04,006
Dave, where the hell are you?

1460
01:09:04,106 --> 01:09:05,074
I'm around.

1461
01:09:05,174 --> 01:09:05,975
Hey, listen.

1462
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:07,276
Where are you?

1463
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:10,479
Are you getting any closer
to settling that civil suit?

1464
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:12,481
It's not a civil
matter anymore, Dave.

1465
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:13,415
What do you mean?

1466
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:15,417
I mean, since you
last checked in,

1467
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:19,155
they exhumed Shannon Moore's
body, looking for needle marks.

1468
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:22,391
They found some,
impaneled a grand jury.

1469
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:26,095
There's a federal warrant
out for your arrest.

1470
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:27,363
Are they out of their minds?

1471
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:31,300
Dave, they may be, but your
position now is critical.

1472
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,002
So as my attorney,
what's your advice?

1473
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:35,971
My advice is to get your
butt back to Michigan ASAP.

1474
01:09:36,071 --> 01:09:37,006
This is no game, Dave.

1475
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:38,073
This is a murder charge.

1476
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:38,974
OK.

1477
01:09:39,074 --> 01:09:40,009
OK.

1478
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:41,410
I'll take the first plane back.

1479
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,646
Where are you?

1480
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:44,547
I'm on my way.

1481
01:09:44,647 --> 01:09:45,581
Never mind.

1482
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:48,918
[music playing]

1483
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,453
What is it?

1484
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:54,056
I'm being charged with
negligence in the death of my--

1485
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:55,257
my wife.

1486
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:56,892
I've got to return to Michigan.

1487
01:09:56,992 --> 01:09:58,260
How soon?

1488
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,930
Well, I've got to get you
on a plane back to Lansing.

1489
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,464
And then I'll--

1490
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:04,867
I'll follow in a few days.

1491
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:07,036
Did you hurt your wife, Dave?

1492
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:10,105
Mona, I hurt my
wife about as much

1493
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,808
as I've hurt you,
which is not at all.

1494
01:10:12,908 --> 01:10:14,310
And I loved her
the way I love you.

1495
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:17,279
[music playing]

1496
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:24,520
[background chatter]

1497
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:25,788
Hi.

1498
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,056
Hi.

1499
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:28,657
Can I help you?

1500
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:30,326
I'd like to buy
a ticket to Hawaii.

1501
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:31,227
OK.

1502
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:32,595
Your name, please?

1503
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:34,330
Bell, David Meyer Bell.

1504
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:37,433
[music playing]

1505
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:02,124
Don, you look
like a drowned rat.

1506
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:03,125
Come on in.

1507
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:06,328
Bob?

1508
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:15,938
We lost him.

1509
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:16,839
[sighs]

1510
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,875
[music playing]

1511
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:32,354
We tried everything.

1512
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:34,089
We even printed
thousands of flyers,

1513
01:11:34,189 --> 01:11:37,226
distributed them in Florida
and the Caribbean area.

1514
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:40,296
We followed leads, nothing.

1515
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:43,899
In 1979, Dave Davis
married Shannon Moore.

1516
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:46,902
In 1980, he killed her.

1517
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:49,838
By 1987, it looked
like he'd gotten

1518
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:52,541
away with the perfect crime.

1519
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:53,676
I hated that.
[knocking]

1520
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:54,677
Yeah.

1521
01:11:57,279 --> 01:11:58,280
Hey, Jack.

1522
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,148
Hello.

1523
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:00,182
How you doing?

1524
01:12:00,282 --> 01:12:02,484
Got an idea on the
Dave Davis case.

1525
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:05,421
You're still the assigned
prosecutor, right?

1526
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:07,156
Yeah, it's somewhere in
the bottom of that pile.

1527
01:12:07,256 --> 01:12:09,725
Well, get it out.

1528
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:13,462
I got a plan to find him.

1529
01:12:13,562 --> 01:12:15,631
Look, Brooks, Davis is dead.

1530
01:12:15,731 --> 01:12:16,765
All right.

1531
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:19,401
He probably tried to con
some Caribbean bad ass.

1532
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:20,469
He's too smart for that.

1533
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:22,304
He's alive.

1534
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:26,742
So what's this
brilliant new plan?

1535

Unsolved Mysteries.

1536
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:28,744
Oh.

1537
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:29,645
Why not?

1538
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:30,646
We've done everything else.

1539
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:32,047
It's the only way
we're going to get

1540
01:12:32,147 --> 01:12:33,515
that case from the bottom of the
stack and put it on top again.

1541
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:34,817
Well, we can't.

1542
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:36,151
The grand jury judge said
we can't talk to the media.

1543
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:38,087
Let's call him up
and ask him again.

1544
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:41,623
I mean, Jack, we do nothing,
this guy got away with murder.

1545
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:44,860
You didn't get into this
business to let people do that.

1546
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,762
We tried everything else.

1547
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:48,163
What do we got to lose?

1548
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:51,200
[phone ringing]

1549
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:55,237
Well, I suppose it
wouldn't hurt to ask.

1550
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,808
If Shannon's death
had been an accident,

1551
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:03,011
I could have accepted it.

1552
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:05,914
But what I couldn't
accept was seeing

1553
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:10,552
a young girl ride
off on horseback

1554
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:11,920
and never come back to me.

1555
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:18,127
What happened out there?

1556
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:21,163
I don't know.

1557
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:23,999
I do know that
she called for me.

1558
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:26,735
And I didn't hear her.

1559
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:27,836
I can't accept that.

1560
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:28,737
I won't.

1561
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:29,638
That's all right.

1562
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:30,939
We're-- we're going to get him.

1563
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:34,543
Wherever he is he, he knows
we're still after him.

1564
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:35,444
We'll get him.

1565
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:36,645
We'll get him.

1566
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:40,115
[intense music]

1567
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:48,524
On July 23, 1980, a small
Michigan farming community,

1568
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:51,226
newlyweds Dave and Shannon
Davis prepared to go

1569
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:54,196
for a sunset horseback ride.

1570
01:13:54,296 --> 01:13:56,999
Within an hour,
Shannon was dead.

1571
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:02,671
After Shannon's death,
Bob and Lucille Moore

1572
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:04,606
began to discover
that Dave Davis was

1573
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:07,376
not the man he seemed to be.

1574
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:10,012
Dave Davis has now disappeared.

1575
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:12,481
There's a warrant
out for his arrest.

1576
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:14,850
The Moores are afraid that
their son-in-law may have gotten

1577
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,285
away with the perfect crime.

1578

[phone ringing]

1580
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:45,514
My wife thought you looked
like a chipmunk on TV.

1581
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:52,554
I told her the camera puts
about 10 pounds on you.

1582
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:56,124
So, nice color
scheme we got here.

1583
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:58,026
Got a cluster call
from Anchorage,

1584
01:14:58,126 --> 01:15:02,030
pretty clear he lived there
for a while, worked as a pilot.

1585
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:03,665
Got some calls from LA?

1586
01:15:03,765 --> 01:15:06,502
Santa Monica area, nothing
in the last five years.

1587
01:15:10,072 --> 01:15:15,010
Yeah, I even got a
call, someone who

1588
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:20,115
thought Davis was the actor who
played him in the recreation.

1589
01:15:20,215 --> 01:15:21,750
Got anything to
bring this bastard in?

1590
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:22,951
No.

1591
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:26,021
Not yet.

1592
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:29,725
And the phone stopped ringing.

1593
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:31,293
Well, I never thought
I'd say this to anyone,

1594
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:34,596
but pray for a rerun.

1595
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:35,797
Good night.

1596
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:38,567
Good night.

1598
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:48,243
He's a cold-blooded murderer.

1599
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:50,345
That's what he is.

1600
01:15:50,445 --> 01:15:56,585
I want to see him
locked up, put away

1601
01:15:56,685 --> 01:16:02,090
before he can do this to any
other girl because he will.

1602
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:05,661
Believe me, he will.

1603
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:08,263
[phone ringing]

1604
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:11,700
Hello?

1605
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,703
This is Detective Don Brooks,
Michigan State Police.

1606
01:16:14,803 --> 01:16:19,374
I can help you find the man
that you showed on television.

1607
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:21,777
Well, ma'am, what
makes you think that?

1608
01:16:21,877 --> 01:16:24,246
I am looking at his
picture right now.

1609
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:25,447
How do you know it's him?

1610
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:27,516
How do you know it's not?

1611
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:29,618
You tell me what you know first.

1612
01:16:29,718 --> 01:16:32,087
Well, there's just one
small problem with that.

1613
01:16:32,187 --> 01:16:33,956
If I tell you, the
judge starts to act

1614
01:16:34,056 --> 01:16:35,157
like I told you what to say.

1615
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:37,759
I need you to tell
me something first.

1616
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:38,794
Like what?

1617
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:39,928
Like something
that proves we're

1618
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:41,863
talking about the same man.

1619
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:43,565
If he's a killer
and he gets off,

1620
01:16:43,665 --> 01:16:45,300
then he could come after me.

1621
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:48,637
We'll keep your
identity a secret.

1622
01:16:48,737 --> 01:16:51,607
Is your Mr. Davis
known by a nickname?

1623
01:16:51,707 --> 01:16:53,775
Here's where I really
need you to tell me.

1624
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:59,147
Cappy.

1625
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:03,185
Have you ever heard
of him called Cappy?

1626
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:05,554
Could you hold
one moment, please?

1627
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:06,521
We got him.

1628
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:07,422
Yes.

1629
01:17:07,522 --> 01:17:09,458
Where?

1630
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:11,660
Ma'am, this is very important.

1631
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,329
Could you please tell us
where you last saw him?

1632
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:21,536
Pago Pago, American Samoa.

1633
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:24,606
[intense music]

1634
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:42,357
What do you think?

1635
01:17:42,457 --> 01:17:44,593
I'm not getting a
good look at his face.

1636
01:17:44,693 --> 01:17:45,727
Last trip to freedom.

1637
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:47,796
Freedom?

1638
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:48,797
Vacation.

1639
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:50,298
Ah.

1640
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:51,566
Where are you going?

1641
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:52,934
I don't know.

1642
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:55,871
May just-- may just get in
my plane and keep on flying.

1643
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:58,740
[intense music]

1644
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:01,843
I see him.

1645
01:18:01,943 --> 01:18:02,744
Let's go.

1646
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:05,514
[intense music]

1647
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:17,392
Are you David Richard Davis?

1648
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:18,360
I don't know anybody by--

1649
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:19,828
- David Meyer Bell.
- Who are you?

1650
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:21,163
I have a warrant
for the arrest

1651
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:22,698
of David Richard Davis a.k.a.

1652
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:26,735
David Meyer Bell on charges
of murder and unlawful flight.

1653
01:18:26,835 --> 01:18:28,003
You have the right
to remain silent.

1654
01:18:28,103 --> 01:18:29,271
You have the right
to an attorney.

1655
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:31,540
If you give up either of
these rights, anything you say

1656
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,141
can be used against
you in a court of law.

1657
01:18:33,241 --> 01:18:34,042
Do you understand that?

1658
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:34,943
Yes.

1659
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:36,011
I ask you again.

1660
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:37,479
Are you David Richard Davis?

1661
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:41,650
What can I say?

1662
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:44,086
It's me.

1663
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:47,122
[phone ringing]

1664
01:18:51,526 --> 01:18:53,995
Hello?

1665
01:18:54,096 --> 01:18:56,498
Oh, thank god.

1666
01:18:56,598 --> 01:18:57,499
They got him.

1667
01:18:57,599 --> 01:18:58,567
Oh.

1668
01:18:58,667 --> 01:18:59,468
Oh, sweetie.

1669
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:01,970
[music playing]

1670
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:09,778
I think maybe it's
time for us to talk.

1671
01:19:14,649 --> 01:19:16,184
I just don't understand
why all of this

1672
01:19:16,284 --> 01:19:19,154
is happening, how anybody could
think that I killed my wife?

1673
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:20,255
That's what you did, isn't it?

1674
01:19:20,355 --> 01:19:21,723
No.

1675
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:22,891
I loved her.

1676
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:24,659
And I don't know how
anybody could think that.

1677
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,661
You mean, other than the fact
you ran on a federal warrant

1678
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:27,763
and changed your name?

1679
01:19:27,863 --> 01:19:30,398
I was scared.

1680
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:33,735
But I never hurt my wife, never.

1681
01:19:33,835 --> 01:19:35,103
Why don't we just get started?

1682
01:19:35,203 --> 01:19:37,572
Shannon meant
everything to me.

1683
01:19:37,672 --> 01:19:39,741
This is all a big
misunderstanding.

1684
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:43,545
Let's get something straight.

1685
01:19:48,683 --> 01:19:50,852
I know everything about you.

1686
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:52,053
I know you like
to give everybody

1687
01:19:52,154 --> 01:19:53,722
red and white carnations.

1688
01:19:53,822 --> 01:19:55,957
I know you never picked up
a football in college, much

1689
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:57,626
less played in a Rose Bowl.

1690
01:19:57,726 --> 01:19:59,828
I know every single
job you ever had,

1691
01:19:59,928 --> 01:20:03,265
especially during the times
you said you were in Vietnam.

1692
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:05,567
I talked to the wife
you said you never had

1693
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:06,902
and most of your girlfriends.

1694
01:20:07,002 --> 01:20:09,971
I can even tell you what they
think of you in the sack.

1695
01:20:10,071 --> 01:20:12,040
I even know what size
underwear you wear

1696
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:14,776
because you left your luggage on
your boat when you skipped out.

1697
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:17,712
So you don't want to
answer my questions, don't.

1698
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:20,382
But spare me the bull
because I'm on to you.

1699
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:22,951
I don't want to hear any
more of your lies, OK?

1700
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,322
Maybe I should
talk to a lawyer.

1701
01:20:27,422 --> 01:20:28,323
Fine.

1702
01:20:32,928 --> 01:20:34,196
I'll tell you what.

1703
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:37,365
When it's over,
let's have a beer.

1704
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:41,169
Then I'll answer
all your questions.

1705
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:42,170
I'll tell you what.

1706
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:47,642
When you're in prison,
Dave, I'll come visit you.

1707
01:20:47,742 --> 01:20:49,010
And we'll have a cup of coffee.

1708
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:51,513
And you can tell me what it
felt like to snuff the life out

1709
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:54,549
of a girl who adored you, huh?

1710
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:58,119
[intense music]

1711
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:12,467
Now, Mr. Davis
said in your presence

1712
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:14,803
that it was Shannon's
desire to be cremated?

1713
01:21:14,903 --> 01:21:15,904
Yes.

1714
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:19,641
David wanted her to be
cremated right away.

1715
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:21,877
Well, based on your
knowledge of your daughter,

1716
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:24,379
did she have any stated
position on cremation?

1717
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:26,114
She was raised Catholic.

1718
01:21:26,214 --> 01:21:29,317
She never would
have wanted that.

1719
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:30,418
Thank you, Mrs. Moore.

1720
01:21:30,518 --> 01:21:31,786
No further questions.

1721
01:21:35,357 --> 01:21:38,126
Mrs. Moore, you're
interested in fairness

1722
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:40,829
in these proceedings against
your son-in-law or are you not?

1723
01:21:40,929 --> 01:21:43,698
Yes, I am.

1724
01:21:43,798 --> 01:21:47,469
Now, as I understand
your direct testimony,

1725
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:48,970
it's your opinion
that Shannon would

1726
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,972
not have wanted to be
cremated because she

1727
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:51,973
was raised Catholic.

1728
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:52,941
Is that correct?

1729
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:54,309
Yes.

1730
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:57,779
Was it not also against the
Catholic religion at that time

1731
01:21:57,879 --> 01:22:00,315
to marry a divorced person?

1732
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:01,650
Yes, but--

1733
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:05,220
And yet, even though Shannon
had been raised to Catholic,

1734
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:08,356
and even though David
had been previously

1735
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:12,928
married and divorced,
Shannon still married him.

1736
01:22:13,028 --> 01:22:15,063
Isn't that true?

1737
01:22:15,163 --> 01:22:17,165
She didn't know.

1738
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:20,168
That David had been
previously married?

1739
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:23,538
She told you that?

1740
01:22:23,638 --> 01:22:25,006
Well, she didn't
exactly tell me.

1741
01:22:25,106 --> 01:22:26,942
But I know that she didn't know.

1742
01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:30,845
But she did not
actually say it to you.

1743
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:33,782
And did she ever tell you of
her wishes not to be cremated?

1744
01:22:36,084 --> 01:22:36,885
No.

1745
01:22:36,985 --> 01:22:38,119
No.

1746
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:40,989
So you can't be entirely
certain that Shannon did not

1747
01:22:41,089 --> 01:22:42,657
want to be cremated, can you?

1748
01:22:47,562 --> 01:22:48,463
No.

1749
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:52,634
Thank you, Mrs. Moore.

1750
01:22:52,734 --> 01:22:55,570
[crowd talking]

1751
01:22:58,673 --> 01:22:59,708
I remember that.
Yes.

1752
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:00,709
I was--
- There.

1753
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:02,077
They're there now.

1754
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:05,080
Mr. And Mrs. Moore, are you
glad the trial is almost over?

1755
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:07,515
I think we'll be glad when
there's some justice done.

1756
01:23:07,615 --> 01:23:08,950
Were you surprised
that Dave Davis is

1757
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:10,118
not justifying his own defense?

1758
01:23:10,218 --> 01:23:11,219
How could he?

1759
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:13,421
He'd just have to admit
to all his own lies.

1760
01:23:13,521 --> 01:23:14,556
And we've
demonstrated that Dave

1761
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:17,192
Davis knew that his
wife would die before he

1762
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:19,594
even met Shannon Moore.

1763
01:23:19,694 --> 01:23:21,963
A year earlier, he had
formulated a near perfect

1764
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:25,533
plan, a premeditated murder.

1765
01:23:25,633 --> 01:23:27,869
But he wasn't picky.

1766
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:30,472
No, Shannon Moore was
merely the most unfortunate

1767
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:32,974
of a long series of girlfriends.

1768
01:23:33,074 --> 01:23:35,343
And she was much
too sweet and too

1769
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:40,015
much in love to say no to his
deadly proposal of marriage.

1770
01:23:40,115 --> 01:23:44,152
Now, Dave Davis is the only
person in this courtroom that

1771
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:47,022
knows exactly what happened
almost 10 years ago

1772
01:23:47,122 --> 01:23:49,724
on that fatal horseback ride.

1773
01:23:49,824 --> 01:23:52,594
But the evidence that
we have presented

1774
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:56,164
paints a pretty clear picture.

1775
01:23:56,264 --> 01:24:00,468
Shannon Moore did not
fall off her horse.

1776
01:24:00,568 --> 01:24:03,138
She did not accidentally
hit her head

1777
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:05,407
on the only rock in
the entire area that

1778
01:24:05,507 --> 01:24:07,776
was big enough to hurt her.

1779
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:09,411
No.

1780
01:24:09,511 --> 01:24:10,979
Dave talked Shannon
into stopping

1781
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:13,415
on the pretext of a
romantic interlude

1782
01:24:13,515 --> 01:24:15,617
to make up for a fight.

1783
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:18,153
Remember, her shoes
were found untied

1784
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:20,588
and her blouse was unbuttoned.

1785
01:24:20,688 --> 01:24:23,058
Sadly, Shannon desperately
wanted her marriage to work.

1786
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:24,793
And Dave Davis took
advantage of that.

1787
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:27,896
[music playing]

1788
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:30,732
This is what I've
been waiting for.

1789
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:35,737
What if anyone sees us?

1790
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:37,305
No, no one's going to see us.

1791
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:40,375
[music playing]

1792
01:24:44,846 --> 01:24:46,247
What are you doing?

1793
01:24:46,347 --> 01:24:49,350
Now, a direct hit
to the bloodstream

1794
01:24:49,451 --> 01:24:51,853
with dioxin chloride will
drop you like a stone

1795
01:24:51,953 --> 01:24:53,755
in just a few seconds.

1796
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:56,558
But on his first try, Dave
Davis could only get off

1797
01:24:56,658 --> 01:24:58,660
a subcutaneous injection,
which is just beneath the skin,

1798
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,930
so he had to inject
her a second time.

1799
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:04,299
[screams]

1800
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:06,801
Ouch.

1801
01:25:06,901 --> 01:25:09,904
[dramatic music]

1802
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:50,211
Ladies and gentlemen,
dioxin chloride

1803
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:53,214
does not render you unconscious.

1804
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:58,553
It renders you immobile,
paralyzing all your muscles,

1805
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:01,589
including the ones that
allow you to breathe.

1806
01:26:01,689 --> 01:26:02,957
But you can still see.

1807
01:26:03,057 --> 01:26:06,094
You can still feel.

1808
01:26:06,194 --> 01:26:08,830
Until the moment of her
death, Shannon Moore probably

1809
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:11,132
knew the horror of what
was happening to her,

1810
01:26:11,232 --> 01:26:14,269
but she was helpless to stop it.

1811
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:15,170
She couldn't speak.

1812
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:16,171
She couldn't act.

1813
01:26:16,271 --> 01:26:20,308
She couldn't even
cry out for help.

1814
01:26:20,408 --> 01:26:24,879
But you, the members of this
jury, can both speak and act.

1815
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:29,117
And today you must,
you must cry out

1816
01:26:29,217 --> 01:26:31,519
for justice for Shannon Moore.

1817
01:26:35,156 --> 01:26:36,057
Thank you.

1818
01:26:43,665 --> 01:26:48,236
There's a lot of rage and
a lot of pain in this room.

1819
01:26:48,336 --> 01:26:51,639
A young woman in the
prime of her life is dead.

1820
01:26:51,739 --> 01:26:52,974
It's terribly unfair.

1821
01:26:53,074 --> 01:26:56,611
And we want to reach out
and punish someone for that.

1822
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:59,347
We can't punish God.

1823
01:26:59,447 --> 01:27:04,385
But Mr. Mandell will
furnish us a scapegoat.

1824
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:06,888
It's his job to
convince you that you

1825
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:11,626
can purge your anger by
seeking vengeance on my client.

1826
01:27:11,726 --> 01:27:13,361
You could go home tonight,
secure in the knowledge

1827
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:16,898
you have helped society
avenge a senseless murder.

1828
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:19,167
It's a satisfying feeling.

1829
01:27:19,267 --> 01:27:21,236
There's just one problem.

1830
01:27:21,336 --> 01:27:27,675
My client David Davis
did not murder his wife.

1831
01:27:27,775 --> 01:27:32,313
Every single piece of evidence
that the state as presented

1832
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:34,349
has been circumstantial.

1833
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:36,884
None of it is direct.

1834
01:27:36,985 --> 01:27:39,287
No one saw a murder.

1835
01:27:39,387 --> 01:27:43,091
No one testified that they
sold drugs, supposedly used

1836
01:27:43,191 --> 01:27:46,227
in a murder to David Davis.

1837
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:48,796
The so-called evidence
about dioxin chloride

1838
01:27:48,896 --> 01:27:51,766
is so much scientific
gobbledygook,

1839
01:27:51,866 --> 01:27:54,302
it's one man's pet
theory, but it's not fact.

1840
01:27:57,205 --> 01:28:00,441
Ladies and gentlemen,
mourn Shannon Davis,

1841
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:07,482
grieve for her parents'
loss, but do justice too.

1842
01:28:07,582 --> 01:28:10,652
Set David Davis free.

1843
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,619
Thank you.

1844
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:19,360
Hey.

1845
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:20,795
How long have you been out?

1846
01:28:20,895 --> 01:28:21,796
Couple of hours.

1847
01:28:24,432 --> 01:28:25,333
Oh.

1848
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:36,144
Um, we just wanted to say
that no matter how this turns

1849
01:28:36,244 --> 01:28:39,180
out, thanks to the both of you.

1850
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:40,581
We think you both
have done everything

1851
01:28:40,682 --> 01:28:42,383
you possibly could to help us.

1852
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:44,952
Listen, Cille, without
your and Bob's determination

1853
01:28:45,053 --> 01:28:46,387
none of us would be here.

1854
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:48,990
Especially Dave.

1855
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:50,658
Well, we'll just have
to say a silent prayer.

1856
01:28:50,758 --> 01:28:51,659
Amen.

1857
01:28:53,928 --> 01:28:54,829
Thanks.

1858
01:28:58,966 --> 01:29:00,335
Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury,

1859
01:29:00,435 --> 01:29:02,036
I have been advised
that you have arrived

1860
01:29:02,136 --> 01:29:05,573
at a verdict which has
just been handed to me

1861
01:29:05,673 --> 01:29:08,009
and which I will now read.

1862
01:29:08,109 --> 01:29:09,277
Mr. Davis, please rise.

1863
01:29:12,647 --> 01:29:16,417
In the case number
90-407b, the people

1864
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:20,621
of the State of Michigan
versus David R. Davis, the jury

1865
01:29:20,722 --> 01:29:25,727
finds the defendant guilty of
murder in the first degree.

1866
01:29:25,827 --> 01:29:29,063
[applause]

1867
01:29:29,163 --> 01:29:30,965
Please, some order.

1868
01:29:31,065 --> 01:29:34,068
Please, let's have some
order in this court.

1869
01:29:34,168 --> 01:29:39,240
Mr. Davis, do you have a
statement at this time?

1870
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:45,446
Your honor, I would only say
that I have committed no crime.

1871
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:47,815
Mr. Davis, I
will, at this time,

1872
01:29:47,915 --> 01:29:51,519
remand you into
custody of the Sheriff.

1873
01:29:51,619 --> 01:29:52,954
This court is in recess.

1874
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:56,557
[music playing]

1875
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:26,154
Mr. Moore, Mrs. Moore,
do you feel like you

1876
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:27,221
got your revenge today?

1877
01:30:27,321 --> 01:30:28,623
Well, this has never
been about revenge.

1878
01:30:28,723 --> 01:30:29,524
It's about Shannon.

1879
01:30:29,624 --> 01:30:30,658
That's right.

1880
01:30:30,758 --> 01:30:32,026
All we can try to do is
give her some justice.

1881
01:30:32,126 --> 01:30:33,261
And I think we did that.

1882
01:30:33,361 --> 01:30:35,663
[reporters shouting]

1883
01:30:41,369 --> 01:30:46,340
Mr. Davis, you are educated,
articulate, and clever.

1884
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:48,943
The murder of Shannon Moore
took place only after months

1885
01:30:49,043 --> 01:30:51,279
or years of planning.

1886
01:30:51,379 --> 01:30:53,247
That is the kind
of act perpetrated

1887
01:30:53,347 --> 01:30:56,751
on society, and
especially upon your wife,

1888
01:30:56,851 --> 01:30:58,653
that prisons are made for it.

1889
01:30:58,753 --> 01:31:01,756
And that, Mr. Davis,
is where you will spend

1890
01:31:01,856 --> 01:31:06,727
the rest of your life, in
prison, without the possibility

1891
01:31:06,828 --> 01:31:08,563
of parole.

1892
01:31:08,663 --> 01:31:12,066
[somber music]

1893
01:31:18,906 --> 01:31:22,176
Honey, let's go home.

1894
01:31:22,276 --> 01:31:25,947
[gentle music]
