1
00:00:01,234 --> 00:00:04,636
To get ajun free,
it is going to
cost me 50,000 pounds.

2
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:07,840
Katherine: What else do
we have, but mei.

3
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:13,312
Every month in this apartment,
an exclusive party is given
to businessmen,

4
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:17,449
Who like to take drugs.
Which are provided
by mr adiola.

5
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:22,621
Mr. Chen employs
migrant girls for sex,
and smart girls to charm.

6
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:26,158
Miss ashley should go
as hostess to charm.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,996
Get this evidence and we will
have your brother free.

8
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,632
I'll do it.

9
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:36,101
I'll do it.

10
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:34,219
We will stay right here,
until you come out.

11
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,829
As soon as you get the shots,
you must leave.

12
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,520
(gate closes)

13
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,590
(doorbell rings)

14
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:59,371
(indistinct chattering)

15
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,209
Is this paula?

16
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,679
Yes.

17
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:12,117
-You are from london?
-Yes.

18
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:15,454
Customers like their girls,
from london.

19
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:19,658
-Are you a virgin?
-No.

20
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,929
Okay. Come.

21
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,901
(indistinct chattering)

22
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:45,751
Only one rule. Anything they
want, you will give. Okay?

23
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,220
Take off your clothes.

24
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,456
Your clothes. Go.

25
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,893
I'm a hostess, not a prostitute.

26
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:58,263
We only have hostesses here.

27
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:01,033
You wanna go, huh? You wanna go?

28
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,102
-No.
-Okay.

29
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,039
So, take off your clothes.

30
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,067
And the rest. Go.

31
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,338
Hurry up.

32
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,221
Turn around.

33
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,599
Put this on.

34
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,270
Bathroom is next door.

35
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,539
(door closes)

36
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,541
(doorbell rings)

37
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:29,988
(speaking chinese)

38
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,160
(speaking indistinctly)

39
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,243
What are you doing here?

40
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,812
I was looking for the bathroom.

41
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:31,216
You know where the bathroom is.
This is not your area.

42
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,094
(sighs)

43
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:52,871
(typing on phone)

44
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,643
(phone beeps)

45
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:05,617
(speaking chinese)

46
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,292
(phone beeps)

47
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,432
(speaking chinese)

48
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,103
(door closes)

49
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,038
(bed creaking)

50
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:31,743
(grunting)

51
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,485
(panting)

52
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,593
(groaning)

53
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,201
(grunting)

54
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,318
(door opens)

55
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,791
(door closes)

56
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,833
(door opens)

57
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,605
(door closes)

58
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,345
(phone beeps)

59
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:51,289
(music playing)

60
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,926
(speaking chinese)

61
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:15,614
-I need cocaine.
-This is only for the clients.

62
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,619
I'll pay for it.

63
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,758
If you want.

64
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,794
You must have it here.

65
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,948
(sniffing)

66
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,221
(door opens)

67
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,032
I've done it.

68
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,635
You got them on camera?

69
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,937
(speaking chinese)

70
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,241
Yes, I got everything.

71
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,845
Mr lin, you lied to me.

72
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,648
Would you have gone,
if I told you the truth?

73
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,053
Did you not ask me to do
whatever it takes?

74
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,691
You better deliver for me.

75
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,395
(engine starts)

76
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,995
(vibrating)

77
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:57,008
-Still nothing?
-No.

78
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,014
Perhaps we should call anderson.

79
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,252
We haven't done the right
thing. Have we?

80
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:12,157
-I better call anderson.
-What does it take for her
to send a text?

81
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,825
I'll call him now.
It'll be early, but...

82
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:19,364
-You can ask him how long
that visa's gonna take.
-He won't know that.

83
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,666
Can't just wait here
and do nothing.

84
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:25,904
It'll take another
couple of days.
We are going as fast as we can.

85
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:29,007
Not the same for you.

86
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:35,513
-No, it's not the same.
-I'm losing her.

87
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:40,819
And you think that too.
'cause I can see it
in your eyes.

88
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,624
As soon as we get out there,
we will see...

89
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:50,762
No, we will see it in her eyes
too. She's not gonna wanna
come home.

90
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:55,333
She's discovering something
really huge in her life.

91
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,936
Something that will
sweep her away from us.

92
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,306
I'm not blaming her for it.

93
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,441
I won't.

94
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,976
But the moment she came home,

95
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:09,914
And mentioned her birth mother.
I just saw this whole scenario,

96
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,116
Opening up.

97
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:16,821
We've just been holding
her for a little while.

98
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,391
Children do go.

99
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,995
Parents can lose their meaning.

100
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:30,001
You're right.
I should know this.

101
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:54,926
-Hey! What are you doing?
-Who is this woman? You again?

102
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,568
(chen on tape)
<i>this is only for the clients.</i>

103
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,738
<i>If you want,</i>
<i>you must have it here.</i>

104
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:14,145
-This is not me.
-Of course it is you. Anybody
can see this is you.

105
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:15,647
-This is not cocaine.
-Then, what is it?

106
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:16,514
I have nothing to do
with cocaine.

107
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:22,153
This recording is going
to the ministry of
public security in beijing.

108
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:27,158
These are all lies.
They are trying to set me up.

109
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,761
You cannot show
this to the ministry.

110
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,896
My cousin will be executed.

111
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:33,331
My office will be shut down.

112
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,999
My whole community
will be banished.

113
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:40,505
There are four nigerian
witnesses to the murder
of chike alozie.

114
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:43,641
Tell them to change
their statements.

115
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,376
And I will destroy this.

116
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:50,515
Mr. Lin, I've been living
in guangzhou, for eight years.

117
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:52,684
I have a very important
position in this city.

118
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:56,521
As the president of
the china nigeria
commerce association,

119
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:58,089
I was approached
by mr quan shin.

120
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:01,092
And he told me to change
the evidence to protect
his nephew.

121
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:04,929
Mr quan shin is the head of the
security division in guangdong.

122
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,631
He threatened all of
our lives here.

123
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,366
He said the witnesses
will be deported,

124
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:11,703
Incarcerated, everything,
if they did not sign.

125
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:14,572
He even threatened
me with deportation.

126
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,607
You may be deported.

127
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,444
But mr adiola will be executed.

128
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:21,179
If you do not do,
what I tell you.

129
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:24,682
Please, I'm trying to protect
my people here.

130
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,852
I'm trying to protect
them from quan shin.

131
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:31,155
Now you'll have to protect
them from this.

132
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,428
There are 25,000 africans
in my community.

133
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,899
He will punish us all if you ask
me to do this. I can't do this.

134
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,169
That is very bad news
for your cousin.

135
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:49,007
Joseph, they will execute me.

136
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,909
Tell the truth.
And tell him to do the same.

137
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:54,112
Why did you get caught
in this stupid web?

138
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:57,015
Look at what trouble
you have caused me!

139
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,452
Mr lin...

140
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:05,490
It is a very difficult life,
for us all here.

141
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,091
We try to do the best we can.

142
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:11,262
-Your life here is not
my problem.
-We are all very poor men

143
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:13,931
Doing the best for our families
back home in nigeria.

144
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:17,435
Your families in nigeria
are not my problem.

145
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,504
I should let him take this
to the police.

146
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:24,575
-They will execute me.
-And I shall let them do it.
You are destroying my life here.

147
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:29,380
Mr lin...

148
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,650
If I ask these boys to sign...

149
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:35,620
We will be signing away
our lives here.

150
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:40,358
We will be forsaking our
families. They will not do it.

151
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:45,930
-Make them do it.
-Mr lin, I am begging
you, please.

152
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:03,014
Okay. I will agree.

153
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:08,319
-I will do this.
Leave it with me.
-I will wait.

154
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,788
-But two of the men
are not here.
-Call the others.

155
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,092
-They may not be able too come.
-Not my problem.

156
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:55,566
This is making me happy.
This is making me have peace
with my god.

157
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,302
Thank you.

158
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:07,612
The boy deserves the truth.
Everyone deserves the truth.

159
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:25,196
(speaking chinese)

160
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:09,073
(speaking chinese)

161
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,713
(speaking chinese)

162
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,983
(speaking chinese)

163
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:04,622
(speaking chinese)

164
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,726
They are all saying
I did not kill chike?

165
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:13,698
-Yes they have changed
their statements.
-Did tao say this thing too?

166
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,101
(speaking chinese)

167
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,175
-And eddie?
-Eddie said the same.

168
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:25,810
Yes. Eddie my true friend.

169
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:30,548
All the africans and everyone
working in the club are now
supporting you.

170
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:37,688
(speaking chinese)

171
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,024
I will be free.

172
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:41,826
Is it really true?

173
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:45,396
The judges will have no choice
but to accept
the new statements.

174
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:49,467
And you have a new
lawyer for the appeal.
Her name is cheng hua.

175
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:51,936
She will be
at the higher court for you.

176
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,338
Everyone is supporting me now.

177
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:59,510
(speaking chinese)

178
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:10,688
She is so happy,
that we are all
together at last.

179
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,958
Now we can really start
to dream.

180
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:17,094
(speaking chinese)

181
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:18,929
I tell her about london.

182
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:28,739
And I'll rock the city.
She doesn't know what I do
when I say I dj with eddie.

183
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:33,277
(speaking chinese)

184
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:39,116
I want you both to come
to london. Tell her.

185
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:43,721
(speaking chinese)

186
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:47,024
I'm so happy we are
all together.

187
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,461
(speaking chinese)

188
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:57,468
I'm going to take her away
from this life.
Now she can rest.

189
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,837
Because I will look after her.

190
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,339
We'll do that together.

191
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:04,341
Yes.

192
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,777
We'll look after her together.

193
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:12,917
(speaking chinese)

194
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,294
(computer rings)

195
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:27,398
Mei. Mei. It is mei.

196
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:30,167
-Mei: <i>Hi mom.</i>
<i>-Both: Hi!</i>

197
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:31,969
-Mei: <i>Hi dad.</i>
<i>-Hi sweetheart.</i>

198
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,638
-Mei: <i>How are you?</i>
<i>-How are you?</i>

199
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,239
I'm great.

200
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:39,710
-Dad: <i>Whats happening?</i>
<i>-Mei: I just want to say...</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

201
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:42,346
Thank you. Thank you for
lending me the money.

202
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:44,048
I'll pay it back. All of it.

203
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:47,918
-But I'm so grateful to you.
<i>-Well, we're pleased</i>
<i>to hear that honey.</i>

204
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,954
<i>But what is happening?</i>

205
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:51,989
What is not happening.

206
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,458
You telling us anything
that is happening.

207
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,161
The detective we hired,
has now got all the witnesses

208
00:24:57,163 --> 00:25:00,197
To make new statements
in support of ajun.

209
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:02,967
Katherine: <i>Really?</i>
<i>Oh, thats wonderful.</i>

210
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:08,239
And we're ready for the court.
For the appeal. It's amazing.

211
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:11,141
-It's amazing.
-Does that mean he's going
to be released?

212
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:15,913
Mei: <i>Thats what the lawyers</i>
<i>have told me. Yes.</i>
<i>Both: That is wonderful.</i>

213
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:18,549
So, thank you. Thank you.

214
00:25:18,551 --> 00:25:21,151
Have you spoken to mr. Anderson?

215
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,890
-I don't want to speak to him.
-Katherine: <i>We think</i>
<i>that you should call him.</i>

216
00:25:25,892 --> 00:25:30,694
-Why?
-Why? Because none of us know
where you are.

217
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:31,428
<i>Where are you, mei?</i>

218
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:35,099
I'm at qianyi's. I've been
staying with her for couple
of days.

219
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:37,902
But you are not answering
your phone.

220
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:39,236
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

221
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:43,541
It's just been crazy.

222
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:48,245
Are you all right?

223
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,583
<i>You are not. Are you?</i>

224
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,487
Have you seen your mother again?

225
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,691
Yes. Yes I have.

226
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,192
<i>I have.</i>

227
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:08,465
It's not that.

228
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:15,573
-Mei, whats going on?
<i>-I'm okay.</i>

229
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:17,508
I'm okay.

230
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,644
I went to the orphanage
with her.

231
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,415
Right.

232
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,453
<i>It was...</i>

233
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,392
She cried and...

234
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,628
<i>I held her and...</i>

235
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,064
<i>It was lovely.</i>

236
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:45,069
<i>It's like a pain in me,</i>
<i>all these years, gone.</i>

237
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,372
That's what it was like.

238
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,712
I can understand that.

239
00:26:56,615 --> 00:27:01,251
Mei: <i>And now,</i>
<i>if I can get ajun out</i>
<i>of prison and free for her...</i>

240
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:04,588
<i>It would be the best thing,</i>
<i>I could ever</i>
<i>do in my life.</i>

241
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,856
<i>The best thing ever.</i>

242
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:09,193
Jim: Sounds like your
going to achieve that.

243
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,795
Yes, I am.

244
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:16,800
I couldn't have abandoned
her and come home.
I had to do this.

245
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,703
Jim: Mei, we are coming
out to see you.

246
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:23,173
We are going to london now
to pick up our visas.

247
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:24,341
Why?

248
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:25,709
-Katherine: <i>Because...</i>
<i>-You don't have to do that.</i>

249
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:30,014
Well, we are. We are doing it.
And the flight's all booked and
we will be coming out and...

250
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:33,217
Mom, dad you don't
have to do this.

251
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:34,818
By the time you get here,
I will be coming home.

252
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,489
Katherine: <i>No, it's already</i>
<i>booked. It's...</i>
<i>We are ready to go.</i>

253
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:43,560
No! I'm okay.
Please let me do
this on my own.

254
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:59,943
(speaking chinese)

255
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:15,159
(speaking chinese)

256
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:36,046
It looks very positive.

257
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:46,890
Members of the central
commission for
discipline inspection,

258
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:47,858
Are coming from beijing.

259
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,528
To open the government's
anti-corruption campaign
here, on the 31st.

260
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:55,265
This is a request for the
newspaper, I work for
to publicize the event.

261
00:28:55,267 --> 00:29:02,573
It says that, "we, all citizens,
all officials, will be given the
opportunity to report anyone

262
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:05,576
"attempting to engage
in unlawful activities,

263
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:08,212
"harming the correct
administration of justice

264
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:10,247
"or the image of the
people's court."

265
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:13,350
-This is good timing.
-It is perfect timing.

266
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:16,653
The campaign is due to start
after li jun's case.

267
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:19,990
But what I can do, is run the
campaign before his case.

268
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:25,229
And that will paralyze
any attempt by quan phong,
to subvert our evidence.

269
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:27,931
We are doing okay.

270
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:34,204
Mei, I believe we can free
your brother. But...

271
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:40,677
There may be consequences on
me and my colleagues. So could
you do something for us?

272
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:45,315
I have a contact at the
new york times,
who is ready to tell our story.

273
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:47,017
As a british and
american citizen,

274
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:50,921
Your unique situation
can give her the angle
she needs.

275
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:52,589
If she calls you,
would you help her?

276
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:57,995
It will bring us support and
put our movement on the map,
in europe and america.

277
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,764
Would you do that for us?

278
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:03,300
-Yes.
-Thank you.

279
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:09,807
Qianyi: <i>In case of li jun,</i>
<i>the night club waiter</i>
<i>sentenced to death</i>

280
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,041
For killing a nigerian trader,

281
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:15,579
11 witnesses have changed
their evidence claiming that
they were coerced

282
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:17,748
<i>Into giving their</i>
<i>original statements,</i>

283
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,850
Under the orders of a senior
provincial official.

284
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:25,222
In response, the party central
committee in beijing has sent
out a stern warning,

285
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:28,892
To the citizens and officials
of guangdong province...

286
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:30,360
(speaking chinese)

287
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:35,232
<i>Any citizen or officer</i>
<i>of the law attempting</i>
<i>to corrupt the courts</i>

288
00:30:35,234 --> 00:30:36,066
<i>Will be arrested</i>

289
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:39,736
<i>And will face a sentence</i>
<i>of life imprisonment.</i>

290
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,439
(speaking chinese)

291
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,174
Quan shin is only
a provincial boss.

292
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:47,644
With beijing breathing
down his neck,
he's nothing.

293
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:48,846
He's beat.

294
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:52,482
(speaking chinese)

295
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:56,320
-Look, the kiosk is
almost finished.
-When will she hear?

296
00:30:56,322 --> 00:30:59,823
(speaking chinese)

297
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:03,560
(speaking chinese)

298
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:19,209
She's just wanting ajun
to come home.

299
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,279
(speaking chinese)

300
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,455
(door opens)

301
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,410
(speaking chinese)

302
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:44,888
(speaking chinese)

303
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:10,313
(speaking chinese)

304
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:42,739
(screaming in chinese)

305
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,218
Did you know this
wouldn't work?

306
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,621
Your friend asked me about
publicizing your group,

307
00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:59,589
To the <i>new york times,</i>
<i>if things didn't work out.</i>

308
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:06,196
Have you been using me? Did you
get me here to help your cause
or to help my brother?

309
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:47,270
(thunder rumbling)

310
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:45,195
(rings bell)

311
00:37:45,197 --> 00:37:46,596
Mr lin.

312
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,845
(speaking chinese)

313
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,627
I thought we can't visit now.

314
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:26,670
(speaking chinese)

315
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,639
I don't understand.

316
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:33,343
(speaking chinese)

317
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,990
I didn't understand why she
is looking so worried.

318
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:52,095
Because the opportunity
to visit is only given
before the execution.

319
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:54,364
That is why she is so upset.

320
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:58,968
So, when is this visit?

321
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:03,740
(speaking chinese)

322
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:10,280
Tuesday. This Tuesday.

323
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,893
(crying)

324
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:58,922
(speaking chinese)

325
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:21,177
(speaking chinese)

326
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,541
(speaking chinese)

327
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:58,848
(door closes)

328
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:17,166
(speaking chinese)

329
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,043
Man: Good morning.

330
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:46,262
Jim: <i>You don't understand</i>
<i>the trouble you are in.</i>

331
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:51,234
Katherine: <i>There's anything</i>
<i>anyone can</i>
<i>do. Least of all you.</i>

332
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,974
(speaking chinese)

333
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:05,081
Jim: <i>The chinese authorities</i>
<i>will come for you, if you</i>
<i>do not leave the country.</i>
