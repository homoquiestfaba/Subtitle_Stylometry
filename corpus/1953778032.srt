00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:24,502
I already have... Oh, baby,
come on. No, no, no.

357
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:26,070
No, I already have too many
directions that I can backslide into.

358
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,839
Shit, I just...

359
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:31,108
ANGUS: Larry!
Yeah, of course I want you at home.

360
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,811
Larry, look,
I need your eyes.

361
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:35,546
I'm in the middle of
something right now.

362
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:37,915
Weinberg said he was
trying to summon Surtr.

363
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,984
S-U-R-T-R.

364
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:42,620
The architect of Ragnarok,
the old Norse Apocalypse,

365
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:44,989
would be specifically
targeting men of God.

366
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:47,458
But the enumerating
cocksucker fucked the math!

367
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,994
It should have shown up
30 years ago!

368
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:52,096
Now, this part...
What's he talking about?

369
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:53,631
Old gods.

370
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:55,866
Worse than demons or the damned.
Larry...

371
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:58,903
Old gods? That's...
That's blasphemous!

372
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:00,738
That's our job,
you android.

373
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,655
What are you doing?

374
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:19,924
What am I doing?

375
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:21,625
I am on the seduction
message board.

376
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:26,530
It's about how
if you insult a girl,

377
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,966
but then you give her
an expensive gift,

378
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,602
then she is honor bound to
let you go down on her.

379
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:32,970
(PUNCHES BRICK)

380
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,473
Or did you mean the thing
with the brick?

381
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:38,509
Oh, I am conditioning my knuckles
for direct striking capabilities.

382
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,549
Are you the only
sane one here?

383
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:48,786
Oh, I do a lot to
hold this place together.

384
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:49,887
Cream?

385
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:51,622
Yeah.

386
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,801
Macon, you in there?

387
00:25:03,803 --> 00:25:06,737
Clint... Mr.
LaPierre would like to ask you some questions.

388
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,573
Macon?

389
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:11,909
He is a napper.
He naps.

390
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:14,912
If he is gone,
I can just show you some of his stuff.

391
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:16,981
Macon, I am
opening the door.

392
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:17,948
(CLEARS THROAT)

393
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,850
Oh!

394
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,652
STEPHEN: Oh, hey guys.

395
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:24,221
In or out? The rabbit
is going to escape.

396
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,156
Thanks.

397
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:34,732
So, yeah,
we could be doing things a lot more efficiently.

398
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:38,135
But the closest we have to
somebody in charge is Angus.

399
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:41,906
I mean, he's not the manager type,
you know?

400
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:43,274
Did you go to school
for management?

401
00:25:43,276 --> 00:25:46,043
No. What's this?

402
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:50,247
This is our sin ledger.
It's how we make sure we are damnation ready.

403
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:52,983
Seven Deadly Sins,
Ten Commandments.

404
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:55,853
We try to...
Well, I try to make sure

405
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:59,957
that everybody is
at least four and six in.

406
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,293
Four and six?

407
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:04,128
Sins. We're sinners.

408
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:07,898
But you're supposedly
men of God.

409
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,234
Exactly.

410
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:14,638
And for the demons who can't get cast out,
sort of a nuclear option.

411
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,775
If you have tried everything else,
you can always invite possession

412
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:20,844
and take the devil to hell
with you through suicide.

413
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:23,847
But you got to
deserve hell, right?

414
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:26,083
I mean, you can't even
get possessed

415
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,085
unless you are in
a morally compromised state.

416
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,121
Okay, let me
understand this.

417
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:35,793
You live a life of sin
to get possessed

418
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:40,130
and then kill yourself and literally
drag a demon back to hell?

419
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:42,366
There's no other way.

420
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:43,867
We're willing to make
that sacrifice.

421
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,806
I don't...
I don't under...

422
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,753
STEPHEN: Clint?

423
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:05,289
No. No, no, no.
No, no!

424
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,858
It takes a great deal
of discipline.

425
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,760
Yeah, I do most of
the record keeping.

426
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:12,863
I mean,
I am really the only one that even bothers.

427
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:13,964
Hold on.

428
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:18,969
It looks Larry has
been slacking off.

429
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,838
We should check on this.

430
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,273
Come on, this way.

431
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:24,375
(WHISTLING)

432
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,146
Hey.

433
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,152
ERIK: Hey, Stephen,
I am stealing something, man.

434
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,121
You put it
in the book.

435
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:41,659
(SNIFFS) Oh!

436
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,932
"If a vortex of sin cracks
the gates of hell,

437
00:27:48,934 --> 00:27:51,435
"the righteous blood sacrifice breaks them wide."

438
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:54,171
Right. Righteous, righteous.
That would mean man of God.

439
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:58,308
So Surtr would possess
a man of God, a priest,

440
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:02,012
and then sacrifice himself
to shatter the gates of hell.

441
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:05,683
STEPHEN: Knock, knock.

442
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:09,753
So, guys,
me and Clint were going through the records...

443
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:13,457
And Larry, you haven't
been keeping up.

444
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:19,697
I mean, if somebody were to perform
last rites while you were dying,

445
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:22,733
it would be enough maybe for admittance to purgatory.

446
00:28:22,735 --> 00:28:24,334
(LAUGHS) Judas.

447
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:25,903
Why?

448
00:28:25,905 --> 00:28:27,471
I mean, why bother
even keeping records

449
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:30,174
if not to know if we are losing discipline?

450
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:31,909
I think you would want to
know that he is not performing

451
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:33,377
at his best ability.
I mean, look!

452
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:34,912
All right, all right,
I have been falling behind.

453
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:36,847
Thanks for the heads up.

454
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:39,450
Penelope has been
going to AA.

455
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:42,119
I'm... I'm just trying to be there for her.
Fucking what?

456
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:44,288
She thinks she has a problem.
Her?

457
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,323
She has a problem?
Yeah.

458
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:49,793
You need to put spirituality before uxorial guilt.

459
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:51,195
And discipline
before all!

460
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:53,464
I'm sinning all the time.
All I do is sin, man.

461
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:55,099
Fuck your driveling
misdemeanors!

462
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:58,035
I'm talking about
quality of sin here.

463
00:28:58,037 --> 00:29:00,337
Murder. Infidelity.

464
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:02,439
When was the last time
you cheated on your wife?

465
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:04,041
Eleven months ago.

466
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,310
Boy, I had to pay
for that one.

467
00:29:06,312 --> 00:29:09,079
"Hellbound" and "saint" are
not words to be taken lightly.

468
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:12,316
Now, you must be looking for every opportunity for sin.

469
00:29:12,318 --> 00:29:15,919
Hmm. Here, take this.

470
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:18,021
It's orange.
I mixed in my stool supplement.

471
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:20,090
(PHONE RINGING) You drink that to the dregs,

472
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,326
sodomize Macon,
and then you talk to me about duty.

473
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:26,130
Macon!
Come down here!

474
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:28,365
And somebody answer
the goddamn Bishop line!

00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:30,768

476
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,803
Are you all right?
I'm fine.

477
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:34,004

Brooklyn Parish.

00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:42,846
Macon! Bring lotion!

480
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:44,348
Right, now,
the vortex...

481
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,083
Thank you,
Your Excellency.

482
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,787
Exorcism call.

483
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:52,890
A woman named Hobbick in Cobble
Hill says she inherited a demon.

484
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:54,291
Inherited?
That's what she said.

485
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,093
Sounds like bullshit.
Where is Macon?

486
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:57,528
He's in his
ghetto sauna.

487
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,229
All right, take him with you.
Oh, thank Christ.

488
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:01,565
No! No you will not!

489
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:03,834
You do not represent
this church.

490
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:10,140
You are all an abomination
against man, law, God!

491
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:13,177
I will do everything
in my authority

492
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:15,179
to make sure that
I see your resignations

493
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:17,481
and that you are excommunicated by the Sabbath.

494
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:19,149
Can I borrow
the MetroCard?

495
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:23,020
Yeah, look, it's a monthly,
so hang onto it, all right?

496
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:24,822
You don't...

497
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:27,257
Hey!
Be careful, okay?

498
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:28,559
Fuck off, Larry.

499
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,161
(TAP RUNNING)

500
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:35,098
Macon, we got a job.
Mmm? Mmm.

501
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:38,969
ERIK: Liz?

502
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:41,371
What's up, Erik?
Hey.

503
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:44,107
Hey, we're trying to get
out the door here, so...

504
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:49,880
Oh, yeah. I got this
lucky chain for you.

505
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:52,082
Oh.
Um...

506
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:56,220
It's... It's like a gift.
It's like a necklace.

507
00:30:56,222 --> 00:31:00,324
Real silver. A lot of carrots,
you know. No big deal.

508
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:01,959
That's really sweet.
Thank you.

509
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:04,161
Mmm.
It's... It's really nice.

510
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,463
Thanks.

511
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:09,066
We should...
We should get going.

512
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:10,200
Yep.

513
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,002
All right. Okay.
Mmm-hmm.

514
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:15,138
Enjoy that.

515
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,910
You stupid slut...
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

516
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:25,649
MRS. HOBBICK: <i>Axel,
my husband, was a minister.</i>

517
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:29,152
Presbyterian at the San Ambrose at 95th Street?

518
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:34,157
I'm not even sure Presbyterians believe in exorcism.

519
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,093
Everybody's got
demons, Mrs. Hobbick.

520
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,896
But we're here
to help.

521
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:44,234
MRS. HOBBICK: Well,
he died three days ago.

522
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:47,104
The few buildings
we owned, I inherited.

523
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:50,274
Where is it?

524
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:53,176
In the mongoloid.

525
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:58,415
Do you mean like North Asian
or are you being inappropriate?

526
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,616
A mongoloid man-child.

527

00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:41,430
No, we have to get her back.
We have to find her.

710
00:46:41,432 --> 00:46:43,032
Is this your
pudenda talking?

711
00:46:43,034 --> 00:46:45,001
My what?

712
00:46:45,003 --> 00:46:50,273
(LAUGHING) So,
you two copulated once without conceiving...

713
00:46:50,275 --> 00:46:52,041
Which is bullshit in the eyes of God,
by the way.

714
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:57,313
We... We lost her.

715
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:58,981
She's not the first.

716
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:01,984
(CHUCKLING)

717
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:04,854
I have been at this
a long time.

718
00:47:04,856 --> 00:47:07,824
I have seen too many
good men die.

719
00:47:07,826 --> 00:47:09,025
We stand up
for each other.

720
00:47:09,027 --> 00:47:12,295
What we share
is discipline.

721
00:47:12,297 --> 00:47:15,164
You give up on that,
and you give up on faith.

722
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:17,834
And then you are
not a Hellbound Saint.

723
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:19,368
Hell, you are not even
a priest anymore.

724
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:21,537
Hey, fuck you.

725
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:24,473
Surtr is out there
right now.

726
00:47:24,475 --> 00:47:27,910
He is a God killer looking
for the edge of hell.

727
00:47:27,912 --> 00:47:29,979
This is no time for weakness.
(PILLS RATTLING)

728

Get your head straight or you
get the hell out of our way.

729
00:47:33,218 --> 00:47:35,351
Give up on her, Larry.

730
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,553
(COUGHING)
You hear me?

731
00:47:37,555 --> 00:47:39,455
Give up on her,
or the hell with you.

Come on, here.
Look, see?

735
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:52,535
Get out of
my fucking sight! Go!

736
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:58,474
Walk out of this church with
your eyes on the fucking floor.

737

You're awake.

You're drunk.

741
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:05,975
Rough day.

742
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,278
You're always drunk.

744
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:15,117
How am I going to not drink
when you smell like whiskey?

745
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:20,256
It's... It's my job.

746
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:24,327

Dozens,

00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:39,735
What is going on?
He's shutting us down.

759
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:41,470
He says
it's from the Bishop.

760
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:43,639
You all slander the Church
and everything it stands for.

761
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:46,142
Read your Bibles.

762
00:50:46,144 --> 00:50:48,310
Jesus Christ closed the gates on hell when he ascended.

763
00:50:48,312 --> 00:50:51,280
You believe in God,
but you doubt hell?

764
00:50:51,282 --> 00:50:53,215
I believe in Jesus Christ,
so I know there's no hell.

765
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:56,519
So, there is no need for embarrassments like yourself

766
00:50:56,521 --> 00:51:00,256
running around escorting demons
back to a place that doesn't exist.

767
00:51:00,258 --> 00:51:02,258
This is a sign
of contradiction!

768
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:07,563
We have real priests authorized by
the Vatican to deal with anomalies.

769
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,067
Those are
dated the eleventh.

770
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:13,302
You have until dusk to
vacate the premises.

771
00:51:13,304 --> 00:51:15,438
The eleventh?

in vain.

it is from Opus Dei.

to maintain his distance.

Opus Dei? You are
not even clergy?

We don't take orders
from the fucking laity.

what you are doing.

I was so nave.

We've only got
until midnight.

795
00:52:29,347 --> 00:52:31,480
And then what?

796
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:35,217
Then hell rises up
and swallows everything.

Oh, Jesus Christ.

00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:39,288

are you doing?

You leper's remnant
in Lot's dowry pouch.

800

Mind the ledger,
make sure the rest of these cock mane flossers

801

are ready for hell!

802
00:52:47,899 --> 00:52:48,931
What is the last sin
you committed?

803
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,201
Discouraging thoughts.

804
00:52:52,203 --> 00:52:54,403
We're going to war, man.

805
00:52:54,405 --> 00:52:56,405
You got to fuck, or steal,
or covet something.

by the demon.

trust him anymore.

Oh, okay.

Erik, go question
the widow Hobbick.

812
00:53:13,424 --> 00:53:15,391
She had that fucker in her basement for 30 years.

813
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:18,494
She's got to know something about
where he plans to locate the vortex.

814
00:53:18,496 --> 00:53:19,461
What about me?

815
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:21,897
What about you?

816
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:24,266
I'm here.

817
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:26,936
Uh-huh.

818
00:53:26,938 --> 00:53:28,637
What's the point, man?
We lost.

819
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,676
What's the point?

820
00:53:33,678 --> 00:53:37,746
The point is,
I haven't gotten in my daily sinning yet.

821
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:40,482
I am hornier than a three-peckered billy goat,

822
00:53:40,484 --> 00:53:42,551
and I will fuck you
into a puddle of chowder

823
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,653
if you don't get
your sweet ass

824
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:46,488
out of my cock range and down
to that widow's apartment.

825
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:48,824
Let me just get
my flip-flops. (GULPS)

826
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:02,805

with the cops.

We need to find
Miss Hobbick.

829
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:10,679
She was married to the dead guy that owned this place.

830
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:12,915
I know
who you're saying.

831
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:15,351
She was the last person to see our friend.
We need to find her.

832
00:54:15,353 --> 00:54:19,355
Crazy bitch gone.
And man-child, too.

833
00:54:19,357 --> 00:54:21,690
The mongoloid?
I thought he was in custody.

834
00:54:21,692 --> 00:54:24,393
He got un-custodied,
I guess.

00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:27,329
Where is she?

837
00:54:27,331 --> 00:54:29,265
Crazy bitch came,
got her man-child,

838
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:30,933
and they went looking
for a shirt.

839
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:33,402
I said to myself,
"That must be a great shirt."

840
00:54:33,404 --> 00:54:35,337
You mean Surtr.
What?

841
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:36,672
Surtr.

842
00:54:36,674 --> 00:54:39,908
You talk English, man?
She took her man-child,

843
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:41,677
and they were talking
about great kills,

844
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:43,279
they were talking
about finding a great shirt.

845

00:54:46,751 --> 00:54:49,652
Holy shit! You've got
Smurbots, man.

00:54:49,654 --> 00:54:50,953
Can I have
some of these?

848
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:53,355
Knock yourself out, boss.
Wait, wait.

00:54:53,357 --> 00:54:54,490
Holy shit.

850
00:54:54,492 --> 00:54:56,458

killing people?

Belonged to
the man-child.

855
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:37,933
I think this is how they kept Surtr in the basement.

856

from your guy?

Yeah, it's the

reaming from the Vatican we are.

their guns away.

They got guns?
Why don't we got guns?

screaming.

that not make the news?

You think
that's 200 dead?

Surtr has no use
for corpses.

868
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:14,036
He needs followers.

00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,039
