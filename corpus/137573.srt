1
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,800
This is our masterpiece.

2
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,500
It brings a tear to my eye.

3
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,500
Vandals!

4
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,000
Let's get them!

5
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,500
That hurt.

6
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,400
Ladies and gentlemen of the press...

7
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,500
...welcome to
the lnternational Space Place.

8
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,000
We at the Space Place
are proud to announce today...

9
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,000
...that the long-awaited mission to Mars
mission is ready to be launched.

10
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,500
We intend to prove positively...

11
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,600
...that there is no life on the planet Mars.

12
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,700
As you are all certainly aware, a mission
of this expense is very expensive.

13
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,300
We just wouldn't shoot two knuckleheads
up there to try and hit Mars.

14
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,200
No, sir. Hours of serious thought
have gone into this undertaking.

15
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,900
And now let me introduce
our intrepid space travelers...

16
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,800
...the only men we could find
that were bold enough to overlook...

17
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,300
...certain shortcomings
and volunteer for this first-ever...

18
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,000
...manned mission to Mars.

19
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,900
I give you Majors Biff Buzzard
and Buzz Blister.

20
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,200
Ladies and gentlemen...

21
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,400
...the myth of little green men
will soon be put to rest.

22
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,000
Little green men!

23
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,700
Aliens. Real aliens.

24
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,900
Hello.

25
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,800
Welcome to Earth.

26
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,400
We hope you have come in peace.

27
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,700
Hey, wait a minute. They aren't aliens.

28
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,800
Hey. You're right!

29
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,200
It's a cat.

30
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
And a mouse.

31
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,500
Get them!

32
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,200
Get them!

33
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,900
Now, watch as I simply add
a single drop of water...

34
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:05,000
...to this powdered pizza dinner, and:

35
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,500
Delicious. Just like Mom tried to make.

36
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,600
Get the stuff loaded
onto the rocket immediately.

37
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,400
What is going on here?

38
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,000
Well, sir, these here
dehydrated dinners...

39
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,300
...exploded, and we don't
really know why.

40
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,900
Well, obviously, they've been rehydrated.

41
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,600
Yes. Well, sir, as near as we can tell,
the dinners got wet.

42
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,700
Yes, that's what rehydrated means!

43
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,400
Okay? And got wet real fast.

44
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,500
And then it just sort of
went, well, kablooey.

45
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,500
Look. Things just don't go kablooey
on their own.

46
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,200
Things go kablooey
for a reason.

47
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,900
There has to be a reason for things
going kablooey. Find that reason.

48
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,600
Or, gentlemen, you will go kablooey!

49
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,400
Yes, sir!

50
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,200
Hey, a mouse!

51
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,400
Mouse in the house!

52
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,800
Get him! Catch him!

53
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,500
I don't want to go kablooey....

54
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,000
A mouse! Commander,
we have a mouse in the house!

55
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,000
Yes, we know, doctor.

56
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,100
Perhaps that pussycat
can be of use to us.

57
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,500
Science has shown that cats harbor
an instinctive dislike for mice...

58
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,900
...and rodents in general.

59
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,100
Good thinking, Dr. Gluckman.

60
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,000
Gentlemen, we need to
get that pussycat back.

61
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,300
Perhaps this rehydrated fish
can be of use, sir.

62
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,300
Okay, now, Earl, don't scare him off.

63
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,000
Just take it slow. Take it slow.

64
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,000
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

65
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,500
Grab him.

66
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,000
We have a job for you, Mr. Pussycat.

67
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,900
Yeah, this is your big day.

68
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,900
Mr. Pussycat, with this job
comes an awesome responsibility.

69
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,400
Are you up to it?

70
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,600
We have a mouse.
And it's up to you, Mr. Pussycat, to...

71
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,800
...eliminate him.

72
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,000
Do it for Earth, my boy-- Pussycat.

73
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,200
Do it for the greater good.
Do it for science.

74
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,300
-What was that?
-I don't know.

75
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,800
Maybe one of the guys
dropped a wrench.

76
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,200
Boy, this is gonna be the easiest
20 bucks we've ever made.

77
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,700
Imagine anyone thinking that
there's such a thing as Martians.

78
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,700
Well, I wouldn't be scared if we, you know,
met up with some real Martians.

79
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,100
Well, I wouldn't either.

80
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,200
Okay, men, we are just about ready
to begin countdown.

81
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,900
Everything all set, up there?

82
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,600
-Yes, sir.
-Roger that.

83
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,700
Prepare ignition procedure.

84
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,800
I have to go the little astronauts' room.

85
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,800
You should have gone before we--

86
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,900
-I know. My kidney weighs 20 pounds.
-How many times do I have to tell you?

87
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,600
Okay, you two, knock it off.

88
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,700
-This is serious.
-No, for real, I have to go.

89
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,100
Eight, seven, six, five....

90
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,000
Blast off!

91
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,500
All systems go on our end.

92
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,400
All systems go here as well.

93
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,500
We are ready to jettison first-stage rocket
on your command, commander.

94
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,400
I love this part.

95
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,100
You are clear to jettison initial stage.

96
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,900
This a breeze, Buzz.

97
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,500
All systems are go.

98
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,100
Congratulations, gentlemen,
you are now leaving Earth's atmosphere.

99
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,700
Zero gravity should commence
right about...

100
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,500
...now!

101
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,200
It's an air leak.

102
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,800
Radiation shields up.
Planetary arbitration disks online.

103
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,100
Backup marine velocity centrometer.

104
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,600
Repositioning flap cables.
Ion gauges tour-ready....

105
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,000
Back up.

106
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,800
It's the window in the second stage.
It's broken.

107
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,500
Quick. Shut the emergency hatch.

108
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,700
Boy, that was a close one.

109
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,900
Too close. Should I engage
the artificial gravity now?

110
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Sure. All this floating around
makes me nauseous.

111
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:13,400
Sir, somehow the rocket's trajectory
has been discombobulated.

112
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,300
Discombobulated.

113
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,900
If isn't corrected, the rocket will crash
into the sun and be vaporized.

114
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,700
I don't think the men will like this.
Maybe we can put it to them nicely.

115
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,400
Hey, aren't we supposed to be
heading for the big red dot?

116
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:47,300
Hey, yeah. Something's wrong.

117
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,300
Yeah, I'll say.

118
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,600
Hello, boys.

119
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,400
-Hi, commander.
-Hi, commander.

120
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,700
Listen, I don't want to
alarm you fellas...

121
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,300
...but we have a teensy-weensy
little problem.

122
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,700
It seems that the trajectory of the rocket
has gone a little bit....

123
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,700
Well, a little bit funny.

124
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,700
-Funny?
-Yes, that's right, funny.

125
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,000
And it seems that if it's not corrected...

126
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:25,400
...you two will crash into the sun
and you will be vaporized.

127
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,200
You mean, we're gonna crash?

128
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,800
That doesn't sound very funny to me.

129
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,400
And me without my sunblock.

130
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,200
One of you will have to
go outside the ship...

131
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,400
...open the fuse box and, well--

132
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,100
Jiggle the wire on the thingy!

133
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,800
You mean that antenna thingy, sir?

134
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,800
Yes, that's it, the antenna thingy.

135
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,500
Rock beats a laser gun, right?

136
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,900
No. No, it doesn't.

137
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Well, you win. You're just too good, Biff.
You always win.

138
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,600
-Well, then, out you go.
-Right. That'll teach you.

139
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,100
-Hey, wait a minute.
-Come on, man, hurry up.

140
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,300
I don't wanna crash into the sun.

141
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm hurrying.

142
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,100
Uh-oh.

143
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,300
What's "uh-oh" mean?

144
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Somehow, we're going to light speed.

145
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,400
Open this--

146
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,600
Mother of pearl!

147
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,800
Can't reach lever.

148
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,700
Make it stop!

149
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,600
Mommy!

150
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,900
Well, men, there she is.

151
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,800
-What?
-Mars.

152
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,700
-Where?
-The big red thing underneath you.

153
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,800
-Oh, that. Yes, wow.
-Oh, that. Yes, wow.

154
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,700
Yes, "wow" is right.
So the big moment is here, everybody.

155
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,700
Okay, prepare the lander.

156
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,600
You know, maybe we should
wait a minute or two.

157
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,600
Yeah, you know,
just to sort of get used to this.

158
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,900
-Yeah.
-Get in that lander, you two knuckleheads!

159
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,000
Or we might just decide
to leave you up there.

160
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,800
Well, here we are, Biff.

161
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,600
The first men on Mars.

162
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,700
Well, we're not exactly on Mars yet.

163
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,400
No, but we will be, in a second.

164
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,900
This doesn't look anything
like the Mars we see in movies.

165
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,300
Yes, chum, this is nothing like
the angry red planet.

166
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,400
I don't see any monsters.

167
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,700
I was looking forward
to battling monsters.

168
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,600
This is more boring
than shopping with your wife.

169
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,400
Doesn't look like much, does it?

170
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,100
Just as we thought,
a completely lifeless hulk.

171
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,900
So who wants to be
the first man on Mars, you?

172
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,500
Congratulations.

173
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,200
Very funny.

174
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,300
Astonishing. Zillions of dollars spent.

175
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,100
Massive amounts
of research and training.

176
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,600
All geared toward answering
man's most compelling of questions:

177
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,300
Are we alone?

178
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,200
Well, sort of looks like it,
for the moment, anyway.

179
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,900
No. I mean, is humanity alone, here,
among the vastness of space?

180
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:20,200
Are we to find other life amongst
this inconceivable immensity of galaxies...

181
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,700
...and clusters of galaxies and clusters
of clusters which are speeding apart...

182
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,400
...into the ever-expanding distance?
Is mankind all there is?

183
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,700
And what is man really, Buzz?

184
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,300
I'll tell you. We are a recently developed
scurf on the epidermis...

185
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,200
...of one of the satellites
of a star in the arm...

186
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,400
...of an average galaxy,
amidst the lesser clusters...

187
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,500
...among the thousands
catapulting apart, which took form...

188
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,300
...some 15 billion years ago
as a consequence...

189
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,400
...of an inconceivable preternatural event.

190
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,100
Right.

191
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,400
I don't see a thing,
if that's what you mean.

192
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,700
Nope. Guess that answers that question.
Let's hit it.

193
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,500
Ubu! No!

194
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,200
It's very rude to point laser guns
at strangers.

195
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,900
Peep, what have you found?

196
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,600
What do you make
of this strange creature, Grob?

197
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,900
Doesn't look like
he's from around here.

198
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,700
He might taste good.

199
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,900
True. In the right sauce,
he might make a fine main course...

200
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,700
...for His Royal Martian Majesty.

201
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,200
No, you fools. Look closer.

202
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:44,500
Does he not resemble the figure
from the ancient scrolls?

203
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,700
Great bouncing Squitsnarfuls,
Grob is right.

204
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,900
He looks just like the Great Gloop.
You know, the brave Skweep Squeezer...

205
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,200
...from Planus Nine.

206
00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:01,200
The one of who it is said will bring
great wisdom to our people.

207
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,300
I don't think so.
I think he's just a cute alien.

208
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,900
If he is, that means
the ancient prophecies are right.

209
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,700
What joy.

210
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,900
At last, the Great Gloop has come.

211
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:23,300
If so, we must take him back
to the palace and pay homage to him.

212
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,000
Yeah, okay.
I'm not exactly certain he's....

213
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,300
All hail the Great Gloop!

214
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,700
Hail! Hail! Hail!

215
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,300
We must bring him to King Thingg.

216
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,200
And so we shall.

217
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,800
We must move quickly.

218
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,200
Soon the Martian desert
will be crawling with Pootsnarfuls...

219
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:54,100
...and many other unsavory creatures
of night. It will not be safe.

220
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,800
Come. We have gone too far.
We have time to lose.

221
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,100
I mean, come, we have far to go,
we have no time to lose.

222
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,400
That's better.

223
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,100
Oh, "smegnar." I always mess that up.

224
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,500
A Pootsnarful! After it!

225
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:18,100
It has the Great Gloop and Peep!
We must save them!

226
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,900
Careful! Do not shoot!
You may hit Peep or the Great Gloop.

227
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,500
Well, what should we do?

228
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,300
You saved me.

229
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,800
Sorry about that, Great Gloop.

230
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,200
Behold, Great Gloop...

231
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:07,100
...our fair Martian city, Toledo.

232
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,900
Who goes there? Friend...

233
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,000
-...or not a friend?
-Friend.

234
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,100
It is l, Grob. I have great news
for His Highness, King Thingg...

235
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,500
...and must have
an immediate audience.

236
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,600
My favorite Martians...

237
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,300
...I present to you his supreme majesty...

238
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:09,600
...the imperious ruler of the red planet,
keeper of the Squink-diddlies of Sprong...

239
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:15,200
...holder of the scepter of Fleebis,
and all-around swell guy...

240
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,100
...King Thingg!

241
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,600
King Thingg!

242
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,700
Workman's comp....

243
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:52,000
I've fallen, and I can't rule.

244
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,500
Make it stop. Make it stop.

245
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,400
Must put in elevator.

246
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,000
My crown....

247
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:12,200
Bruising. Bruise. Painful. Broken bones.

248
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,800
I meant to do that.

249
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,100
I believe him to be the Great Gloop...

250
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,300
...the one spoken of in the ancient scrolls.

251
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,600
You are correct, Grob.
It is he, the Great Gloop.

252
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,100
The Great Gloop has returned to us.

253
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:45,200
At last! What a great day.

254
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,000
Let the celebration begin.

255
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,300
In exchange for the infinite wisdom
you will bring to us...

256
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,200
...we offer you these gifts.

257
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,300
Sire....

258
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,700
How dare you interrupt the royal feast.

259
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:21,600
I'm sorry, sire, but a giant
has infiltrated the walls of the city.

260
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:26,300
Is this a joke?
There are no such things as giants!

261
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,300
A giant!

262
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,100
Fellow Martians!

263
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,900
Because this fuzzy giant monster
has made a shambles...

264
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,400
...of our lovely city, he will be dumped
in the hole with Ted...

265
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,300
...the flesh-eating lava-dweller.

266
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:05,400
The Great Gloop will be given
the honor of pulling the lever...

267
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:10,100
...sending this destructive
and fuzzy giant to his doom.

268
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,400
You may pull this when ready,
Great Gloop.

269
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,700
-Just give it a pull.
-Wait. Hold it. Stop.

270
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:27,800
This is not the Great Gloop.

271
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,100
He is an impostor.

272
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,100
What do you mean?

273
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,700
They are aliens.

274
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:37,300
From-- From Earth.

275
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:40,100
-Earth?
-Earthlings?

276
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,400
-Aliens.
-Aliens.

277
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,400
Nonsense! There is no life on Earth.
Is there?

278
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,100
Apparently so, my king.

279
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,800
You see, a spacecraft was detected
on our scopes earlier.

280
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,900
It landed, and stayed only long enough
to drop these two invaders off.

281
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,700
They must be the first wave
of an invasion.

282
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:05,700
One pretends to be the Great Gloop,
and the other destroys our city.

283
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:09,300
So try to take over Mars, will you...

284
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,700
...Earthling?

285
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,300
They're getting away.

286
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,700
Peep is a traitor.
She helped the invaders escape.

287
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,800
Okay. That's all right.

288
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,400
You're welcome. No, that's--

289
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,100
That's okay--
Okay, you're welcome. Okay.

290
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:44,900
Look, I know my people are going to plan
an invasion of your planet in retaliation.

291
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,700
We have to get you back there
so you can warn them.

292
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,100
We'll have to sneak back to the city
and steal a saucer.

293
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,300
Can either of you pilot
a flying saucer?

294
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,200
Well, that figures. Okay, come on.

295
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:04,000
We'd better hurry. Follow me.

296
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,100
Today, we invade Earth.

297
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,100
Prepare the saucers.

298
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,200
We've got to get into
one of those saucers.

299
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,400
All pilots report to your saucers
and prepare for liftoff.

300
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,700
Our target, Earth!

301
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:30,700
Okay, boys, this is it.
The fate of your home planet is at stake.

302
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,800
There's our saucer. Let's go.

303
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:11,300
Close the hatch.
We gotta get out of here fast.

304
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,400
Press that one.

305
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,200
No, not that--

306
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,100
Oh, launch the lnvince-a-tron.

307
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,100
Get that thing fixed!

308
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,900
Mission control, this is Mars One.

309
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,800
We are entering the atmosphere now.

310
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:13,400
Well, men, they should be
landing any second.

311
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,600
You guys need a maid.

312
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,000
What's that noise?

313
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,600
Oh, an asteroid field.

314
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,500
An asteroid field?!

315
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:12,700
Remind me never to let you drive again.

316
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,100
Okay.

317
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,200
Well, it's about time, general.

318
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,600
Come on!

319
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:27,500
And so, ladies and gentlemen of the press,
without further delay...

320
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,600
...I give you Buzz Blister
and Biff Buzzard...

321
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:34,900
...the brave astronauts who made
this mission the success that it was.

322
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,700
Gentlemen?

323
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,100
So is there life on Mars?

324
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,500
Say, do we have to worry
about an invasion...

325
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,400
...of extraterrestrial alien Martians
from outer space?

326
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:50,600
I'm here to tell you all,
my inquisitive friends...

327
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:54,100
...once and for all, there is absolutely...

328
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,800
...unequivocally, no life on Mars.

329
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,600
Martians?!

330
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,200
Say, these are tiny.

331
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,300
He's right. Look, it's like a toy.

332
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:22,500
What could this little thing possibly do
to a big, strong astronaut like me?

333
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,900
All we need are some fly swatters
to combat this alien menace.

334
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,100
Say, they're kind of cute.

335
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:39,700
Biff! Speak to me, chum.

336
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
No!

337
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,100
Come on, Gluckman!
You're a scientist. What do we do?

338
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,100
I.... I don't know.

339
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,900
This is unprecedented.

340
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:06,900
Come on, use that brain of yours,
you worthless egghead!

341
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,000
Earthlings!

342
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,800
Is this thing on?

343
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:55,100
Earthlings, we are taking over
your planet.

344
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,400
Right. Now, listen up.

345
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:01,000
We Martians are in charge now, and--

346
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,200
Get that saucer's number.

347
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:29,600
-But who?
-Why?

348
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:30,800
What?

349
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,800
Hey.

350
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:40,200
-It's that crazy pussycat.
-Yeah, and he caught the mouse.

351
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,600
Two mice.

352
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:46,000
Wait a minute. She's one of them!

353
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:51,900
Reintegrate them with this.

354
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,200
Trust me.

355
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:27,100
Biff! They've saved us.

356
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:32,000
So they did.
Maybe Martians aren't so bad after all.

357
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,700
It's the lnvince-a-tron!

358
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:24,100
It's using its vacuum.
Quick, back to the saucer!

359
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,300
Wait. Don't leave us here.

360
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:39,000
Stop! Wait for us!

361
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:42,500
We'll press charges,
you Martian menace!

362
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,000
Thanks.

363
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:46,800
Now, let's head right for him!

364
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,100
Ready?

365
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:12,300
Here we go!

366
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:20,400
I'm alive! I'm a--

367
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,700
Mr. Pussycat, Mr. Mouse
and Miss Martian...

368
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:05,300
...how can we ever repay you?

369
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:09,200
The entire planet owes you
a debt of gratitude.

370
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,400
If not for your ultra-neato strategy
and "braverosity"--

371
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,700
You know what I mean.
All would have been lost.

372
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:27,400
Okay, on behalf of all of these people
on Earth, I thank you.

373
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,200
Here's a Hummer.

374
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,900
Hey, need a lift?

375
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:24,800
-You and your big mouth.
-Yeah?

376
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,000
How'd you like a free trip to Mars?

377
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,500
I already had one, thanks!
