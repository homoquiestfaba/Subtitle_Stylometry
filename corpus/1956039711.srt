1
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,988
<i>In the beginning, they were
just ordinary street rats</i>

2
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:35,577
<i>until they were captured
by man and taken to NIMH,</i>

3
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,913
<i>The National Institute for Mental Health.</i>

4
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,167
<i>They went through experiments.</i>

5
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:47,505
<i>For some strange reason,
they'd become intelligent.</i>

6
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,800
<i>They found they could read.</i>

7
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:55,430
<i>So they escaped through the vents.
None of them would have survived</i>

8
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:59,976
<i>were it not for the bravery
of that great mouse, Jonathan Brisby.</i>

9
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,980
<i>But, alas, he could not save himself.</i>

10
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,485
<i>The wisest of creatures,
the Great Owl once said,</i>

11
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:13,948
<i>"Jonathan Brisby was the bravest
of them all."</i>

12
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,327
Tonight, we journey to Thorn Valley.

13
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:21,664
We must leave no evidence
that the rats of NIMH ever existed.

14
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,877
<i>Jonathan Brisby's widow
and family stayed behind</i>

15
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,380
<i>in the home they'd always known.</i>

16
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:34,135
<i>The prophet, Nicodemus, predicted
that NIMH will thrust its evil on the rats.</i>

17
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,681
<i>And a son of Jonathan Brisby</i>

18
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,100
<i>will be chosen to save them.</i>

19
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,161
Whoa!

20
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:04,374
-I'm gonna catch up. Watch out, Timmy.
-No way.

21
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,422
Last one back's a load of kitty litter.

22
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,216
Hey, get back here.

23
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,056
-See you, Timmy.
-Martin.

24
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,559
Hey, come back!

25
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,270
Time for a shortcut.

26
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,065
Martin!

27
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,657
What's going on?

28
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,245
I think we've caught one, Dr. Valentine.

29
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:48,168
Help! I'm trapped! Martin, help!

30
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,419
Timmy?

31
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,672
I told him to stay on the path.
He never listens.

32
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,384
Martin, help me.

33
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,387
Lift the door.

34
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,223
Run!

35
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,935
It has to be one
of the escaped rats, doctor.

36
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,232
He was smart enough to undo the latch.

37
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,442
They must be close.

38
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,196
It's them!

39
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,412
This was our last race together,
and I ruined it.

40
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,956
I'm sorry, Martin.

41
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:32,504
No. I'll be the sorry one
if something happens to you, hero.

42
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,006
Don't call me that, Martin.

43
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,218
You're the hero type, not me.

44
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,806
-Nicodemus should've chosen you.
-For once, you're right.

45
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,141
I'm older and stronger than you.

46
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,353
If Thorn Valley
wanted Jonathan Brisby's son,

47
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,854
why'd they pick the runt?

48
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,023
It's true.

49
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:56,611
-I mess up everything.
-Look, I'm sorry, Timmy.

50
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,863
You'll do great. Really.

51
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,617
Come on, or you'll miss your flight.

52
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,452
Hey!

53
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,455
Wait a minute.
I've got something for you. Here.

54
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,710
-A going-away present.
-Golly. For real?

55
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,004
Teach me.

56
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,132
Wow! What a shot!

57
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,135
Just set your sights,
concentrate on the target,

58
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,302
then let her rip.

59
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,807
Come on, you can do this.

60
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,392
Aim a little high now,

61
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,019
and fire!

62
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:35,692
That's using your head, hero.
I know you're trying, but remember,

63
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,403
"Some try. Brisbys do."

64
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,866
When I grow up,
I wanna be just like you, Martin.

65
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:46,911
Yeah, well, I think everybody else
got a different mouse in mind.

66
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,206
I can do it. Just like...

67
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,750
-Timmy!
-...you!

68
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,711
Landing gear down. I said...

69
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,757
I'm hit! I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday!

70
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,592
Incoming!

71
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,722
Prepare for a water landing!

72
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,224
Oh, my!

73
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,685
Are you okay, Jeremy?

74
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,356
I'm okay. No problem.

75
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,400
I'll fly Timmy to Thorn Valley. No problem.

76
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:22,947
The white zone is for the loading
and unloading of passengers only.

77
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,411
There. Now, son, you listen
to your teachers, Justin and Mr. Ages.

78
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,538
-Okay?
-Okay, but...

79
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,625
What do you do
if you're ever really in trouble?

80
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,251
Run. What else?

81
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,466
I'm to find the Great Owl
just like you did, but...

82
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,885
That's my boy.

83
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,305
But, Mom, I don't wanna go.

84
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:53,687
We all know what your father
meant to the rats of Thorn Valley.

85
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,942
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He helped them get away
from NIMH. Pop was a real hero.

86
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,111
That's right. And?

87
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,113
And they want me to be like him, but...

88
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:07,200
But nothing. Okay, hero, let's saddle up.

89
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:10,078
Come on, Jeremy, time to make tracks.

90
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,580
That's exactly why I'm here.

91
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,416
So, let's hit the road.

92
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:19,838
When I say road,
I mean that highway in the sky, actually.

93
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,635
Keep it. Someday, you'll figure it out.

94
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,679
-I'll miss you, Martin.
-Timmy.

95
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,140
You're the best big brother ever.

96
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,352
Are you sure you know the way, Jeremy?

97
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,812
Piece of cake, Mrs. B.

98
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,523
Thorn Valley is...

99
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,025
You know...

100
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,360
Why, it's...

101
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,404
South by south by south.

102
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,239
Right. Right.

103
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,700
South by... What you said exactly.

104
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,993
As the crow flies.

105
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,327
Bye, Mom.

106
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,330
Bye, Timmy. Be good.

107
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,542
Don't forget to write.

108
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,377
-So long.
-Bye, Martin!

109
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:03,506
A little momentum.
Hold on to my feathers. Here we go.

110
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,010
Whoa! I lost altitude. My right rudder.

111
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:10,930
Okay, everybody. We have liftoff! All right!

112
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,725
Watch over our son, Jonathan.

113
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:19,564
Well, my nephew is off to a grand future.

114
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:23,193
-What a lucky boy.
-Yeah. Lucky is right.

115
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:27,155
I'm older and stronger, but...
But he gets to go.

116
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,532
It's not our decision, Martin.

117
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:33,328
The great Nicodemus foretold it.

118
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,080
Big hairy deal.

119
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,583
-Some old rat says he gets to...
-Don't be rude!

120
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:43,380
Nicodemus wasn't
just an old rat, young man. He was...

121
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,716
I don't care who he was.
I have a destiny, too.

122
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,636
It's just not fair!

123
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,222
-Martin.
-The heck with him.

124
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,599
He always was a rude little piglet.

125
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,273
So, kiddo, how you doing?

126
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,484
-Kiddo?
-I'm okay.

127
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,405
"Okay"? "Okay"? That's it?

128
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:13,076
Well, I guess I'm just wondering
why Thorn Valley's so great.

129
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:18,331
That's easy. I mean...
Thorn Valley's great because...

130
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,749
Well, because...

131
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,253
Because there's nowhere else like it.

132
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,756
Nowhere else comes close.
It's the past, the future.

133
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,427
It's a blast!
It's the most sophisticated city.

134
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,053
In a sleepy village, green.

135
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,180
From the ice age to the mice age,

136
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,808
and everything in between!

137
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,938
Come! Make the most of your life!

138
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,400
Look!

139
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,657
Jeremy, this is awesome!

140
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,456
-It's Tim Brisby!
-There he is!

141
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:00,790
Timmy!

142
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,667
Hello down there!

143
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,586
Welcome!

144
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:10,342
-There it is, Jeremy!
-I'm coming. I'm coming. Hold on.

145
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,098
Pull up, Jeremy. Pull up!

146
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,484
<i>You wanna relax
Then take what you please</i>

147
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:31,112
<i>There's candy galore
And it's all made of cheese</i>

148
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,908

Another surprise</i>

149
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,370

<i>Come on, find out what it's like</i>

153
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,304
<i>You'll want to play ball
And hit a home run</i>

154
00:09:56,888 --> 00:10:00,600
<i>You'll want to play loud
You could be number one</i>

155
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:04,270
<i>So lie on your back
And float down the stream</i>

156
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:08,692
<i>Or hold your breath
And shut your eyes and scream!</i>

157
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,033
That's it! That's it!

158
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,204
<i>Come make the most of your life</i>

<i>You wanna invent, you wanna explore</i>

<i>To come up with things
No one thought of before</i>

164
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,099
<i>To aim for the stars</i>

165
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,143
<i>You set your sights high</i>

166
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:46,312
<i>You won't know if it works until you try</i>

167
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,607
<i>Come make the most of your life</i>

<i>The way that the world should be</i>

00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,594
<i>Help yourself to the greatest things in life</i>

175
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:21,348
<i>To the best and the latest things in life</i>

176
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:25,143
<i>The safe and the sound
What's yet to be found</i>

177
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:29,105
<i>As far as your mind can see</i>

178
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,940
Why me?

179
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,484
Why now?

180
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:36,154
<i>What is it I'm meant to do?</i>

181
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,991
<i>The best you can</i>

182
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:44,287
<i>The answer is up to you</i>

183
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,458
<i>So</i>

184
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:52,504
<i>Come on in to the greatest kind of life</i>

185
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:56,341
<i>To the best and the latest kind of life</i>

186
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:00,470
<i>The tried and the true
The newer than new</i>

187
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:04,474
<i>The way that the world should be</i>

188
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:08,311
<i>The safe and the sound
What's left to be found</i>

189
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,313
<i>The way</i>

190
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,650
<i>That the whole wide world</i>

191
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:19,280
<i>Should be</i>

192
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,284
Dad?

193
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,161
Welcome, young Master Brisby.

194
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,871
I'm Justin.

195
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,834
And I'm Mr. Ages. We're here to teach you.

196
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,003
Teach me what, Mr. Ages?

197
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,172
Anything and everything

198
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:39,676
to help you become the best you can be.

199
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:54,065
Timmy, you've got
to be ready mentally and physically!

200
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,194
But ready for what?

201
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,783
To fulfill your destiny.

202
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,374
To fulfill my destiny?

203
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:15,045
But I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

204
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:18,798
Right now, nobody does.
You've got to adapt and improvise.

205
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,135
All right. Take it on up.

206
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,263
-Swing around, fellas.
-There you go.

207
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:26,681
Heads up.

208
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,476
Oh, boy!

209
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,782
When your father saved the rats of NIMH,

210
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,076
he didn't know it was his destiny.

211
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,161
But I'm not my father.

212
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,706
Well, let's let history
be the judge of that, shall we?

213
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,026
And don't come back!

214
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,570
<i>Whipsicus silvestrus.</i>

215
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:27,242
<i>Campanula rotundifolia.</i>

216
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,456
<i>-Reptilicus airbornicus.
</i>-Mr. Ages!

217
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,167
Did you see it, Mr. Ages?

218
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,630
That old snake won't be hunting us
for breakfast anymore.

219
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:44,259
No, I suppose he won't.

220
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,097
Now I know what happened to the
weather balloon I asked you to get me.

221
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:53,893
I'm sorry. I was just trying
to help make the valley safe.

222
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:58,690
The valley is safe as long as it
remains unknown to the outside world.

223
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:03,570
My boy, what have I been trying
to teach you all these months?

224
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:10,994
That it's okay for guys to wear
the same underwear three days in a row?

225
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:14,539
Well, that was just between us.

226
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,499
Now, what else?

227
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,544
I've got to think things all the way through.

228
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:26,384
If snakes go flying through the air,
humans might find out about Thorn Valley.

229
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:29,637
And then we might be in real danger.

230
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,805
From who?

231
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,224
-From NIMH.
-What's NIMH?

232
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,810
Let's hope you never find out.

233
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:41,107
Your father saved us from NIMH.
We wouldn't be here if not for him.

234
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,652
Jonathan Brisby was a great mouse.

235
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,447
And you're his son.

236
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,658
You can be every bit
as remarkable as he was

237
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,370
if you think things through.

238
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,374
Always see the big picture.

239
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,502
I'll never be you.

240
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,881
<i>Never live up to the deeds that you did</i>

241
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:08,134
<i>Why don't I have you</i>

242
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,387
<i>To show me the way?</i>

243
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,890
<i>You're everyone's hero, I'm only a kid</i>

244
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,939
<i>I never knew you</i>

245
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:24,401
<i>All that I know is the fame that you've won</i>

246
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,779
<i>I never had you</i>

247
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,906
<i>To show me the way</i>

248
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:33,284
<i>You're everyone's hero</i>

249
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:36,579
<i>I'm only your son</i>

250
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,749
<i>One day they'll know me</i>

251
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,837
<i>They'll hear what I've done</i>

252
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:47,632
<i>I will show the world</i>

253
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:50,802
<i>I'm my father's son</i>

254
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,555
<i>I'll face any foe</i>

255
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:58,268
<i>Undertake any quest</i>

256
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,104
<i>Any challenge, any task</i>

257
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:05,525
<i>I'll prove I'm the best</i>

258
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:17,579
<i>I'll always have you</i>

259
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,041
<i>I am a part of the tale you've begun</i>

260
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:24,544
<i>You will be with me</i>

261
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:29,799
<i>Each step of the way
I'll make everyone's hero</i>

262
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:33,345
<i>Be proud I'm his son</i>

263
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,097
<i>One day, you'll see</i>

264
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:40,643
<i>I will equal your fame</i>

265
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:44,064
<i>I will show the world</i>

266
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:47,192
<i>I deserve your name</i>

267
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:50,653
<i>And they'll tell our story</i>

268
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:54,741
<i>They'll know what we've done</i>

269
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,827
<i>One day, I will show the world</i>

270
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:01,790
<i>I'm my father's son</i>

271
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:04,876
<i>One day, I will show the world</i>

272
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:11,841
<i>I'm my father's son</i>

273
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:15,512
<i>Tim!</i>

274
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,639
What did I do now?

275
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:22,936
Know where I can find a volunteer
for tonight's collection detail?

276
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,522
Me?

277
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,609
Where to tonight?

278
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:32,696
Where humans live,
to collect what they throw away.

279
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,073
We're almost there.

280
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,909
What do I need a whistle for anyway?

281
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:42,539
To warn us in case Killer shows up.

282
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,165
Killer?

283
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:48,336
The meanest,
baddest watchdog around these parts.

284
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,922
Yeah. He could be anywhere,

285
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,717
so keep your eyes open.

286
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,265
Hold it.

287
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,058
Stay here and keep watch.

288
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:06,062
-But I wanna be in on the action.
-You're not ready.

289
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,481
Don't blow it, kid.

290
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:11,693
-I mean... You know what I mean.
-But I...

291
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:16,031
No buts. You're part of a team.
Stay on guard.

292
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,743
Tagalong Timmy.
That's all I'm ever gonna be.

293
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:22,328
I'm never gonna see any real action.

294
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,417
-Almost there!
-Keep it down.

295
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,836
Don't leave my post.

296
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,427
Who... Who's there?

297
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:45,894
Hey!

298
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:56,279
-What are you doing up there?
-Trying not to starve.

299
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,616
-What are you doing down there?
-I'm standing guard.

300
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,578
Looks more like sitting to me.

301
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,330
My name's Jenny.

302
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,624
I'm Timmy... Tim.

303
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:11,961
-Thanks for the lift.
-You're welcome, Timmy-er-Tim.

304
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:14,381
So you from around here?

305
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,049
No. I'm from the...

306
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:20,095
-What's wrong, cat got your tongue?
-Close!

307
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,180
Who turned off the lights?

308
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,142
Run for it!

309
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,733
-We've got company.
-He left his post!

310
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:35,402
I should have listened!

311
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,574
-Tim!
-We're coming.

312
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,175
Jenny!

313
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,553
Are you all right?

314
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,638
Yeah.

315
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:12,480
-An automatic gate closer.
-You can read?

316
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:15,483
-Help get this out of the way!
-Of course!

317
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,200
Justin! Brutus! Over here!

318
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:26,828
Hungry, big guy?

319
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,038
Killer want a cracker?

320
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:30,665
Just a couple more seconds!

321
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,716
Justin, she can read!

322
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,010
Read?

323
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,225
<i>You left your post. You put us in danger.</i>

324
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:51,728
-But I...
-You must listen.

325
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:55,065
You think you know better
than everyone else.

326
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:59,194
I'm sorry. But that doesn't change
the fact that Jenny can read.

327
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:02,030
Is that true, young lady?

328
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:06,576
-Can you really read?
-Yes. I was sent here to find you.

329
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,913
To find us? We don't want to be found.

330
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,498
Who knows about us?

331
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:13,083
My parents, to start with.

332
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,460
And who might your parents be?

333
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:17,420
The McBrides.

334
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:20,465
-What?
-Well, I'll be...

335
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,801
Two of the lost six.

336
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:26,346
That's impossible. They were lost
when we escaped from NIMH.

337
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:33,269
<i>They were swept into the vents,
but they ended up in the basement.</i>

338
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:36,356
<i>They stayed until the injured healed.</i>

339
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:39,442
<i>When they tried again to escape,
that's when it happened.</i>

340
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:42,278
-Quickly!
-Run! Hurry!

341
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:46,366
<i>They were recaptured by Dr. Valentine.</i>

342
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:50,120
Everything is changed at the labs.

343
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:53,123
Dr. Valentine is crazier than ever.

344
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:56,668
My parents and the others
sent me to find you.

345
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,799
-You've just got to help.
-You ask too much, Miss McBride.

346
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:06,011
Something terrible
is about to happen at NIMH!

347
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:11,307
No one knows what, but it's something
to do with the next full moon.

348
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:13,643
The full moon?

349
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:18,189
<i>O sole meow</i>

350
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:20,775
<i>The milk is nice</i>

351
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:22,861
Sing it, Muriel.

352
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:28,450
<i>Le sento meow</i>

353
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:31,911
<i>My love is</i>

354
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:36,249
<i>Nice!</i>

355
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,086
What the...

356
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:49,304
Here, kitty, kitty.

357
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:54,017
Hello. At least someone appreciates talent.

358
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:56,644
I'm the talented one.

359
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:59,856
Nice kitty, kitty, kitty.

360
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,738
Stinking, rotting fish.

361
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:09,866
My favorite cuisine.

362
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,284
Excuse me?

363
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:15,955
Where are your manners,
you hairball-with-feet?

364
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:19,668
I'm sorry. After you, my little nightingale.

365
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:26,049
Wait up, snookums.
Might I have your leftovers?

366
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:28,176
Over my dead body.

367
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:47,070
What's taking them so long to decide?

368
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:51,950
Don't worry. Mr. Ages says,
"Good things come to those who wait."

369
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:56,913
I can't wait!
You have any idea what it's like at NIMH?

370
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:58,623
They live in cages,

371
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:01,751
waiting for the scientists
to do who knows what to them.

372
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:05,255
How could you know?

373
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:08,591
I mean, just look at this place.

374
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:12,137
I bet no one here ever worries
about their family.

375
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:17,475
Well, I do. I haven't seen them
since I came to Thorn Valley.

376
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:19,060
They're here.

377
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:24,232
The answer is no, isn't it?

378
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:26,359
We're very sorry.

379
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:30,071
The council decided the risk
to Thorn Valley was too great.

380
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:31,823
We can't go.

381
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:34,701
I'm going to have to do it myself.

382
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:38,038
I'm not going to let anything
happen to my parents!

383
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:40,331
I can't let you leave.

384
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:47,380
There are guards everywhere,

385
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:50,300
watching our every move.

386
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:53,887
We're trapped!
And I thought NIMH was a prison!

387
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:58,641
Miss McBride, I've made a bed
for you in the observatory.

388
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:02,479
I hope you'll be comfortable.
Good night, children.

389
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:04,689
Sorry to keep you a prisoner.

390
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:06,858
I've got to get out of here.

391
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:09,486
It would be easier with help.

392
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:14,532
They just don't want you
telling anyone on the outside about us.

393
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:17,202
Wait a second!

394
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:19,662
How'd you know about Thorn Valley?

395
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:24,292
When I was little,
a mouse in the cage next to ours

396
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:27,212
told us how the rats
that escaped from NIMH

397
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:29,464
had settled in Thorn Valley.

398
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,883
And if any of us ever escaped,

399
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:36,763
we should promise to go
and ask them for help. Yeah, right.

400
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:38,598
But how did you ever find it?

401
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:43,019
I remember him saying
it was south by south by south.

402
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,897
Martin said that.

403
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:50,402
You know, I'd forgotten,
but I think that was his name.

404
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:51,695
How did you know?

405
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:54,155
Martin's my brother.

406
00:26:55,532 --> 00:27:00,370
My mom's letter said he disappeared.
She had no idea what happened.

407
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:02,080
Well, he's at NIMH.

408
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:05,000
No! Martin's at NIMH?

409
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:08,628
-They captured him. Is he all right?
-I hope so.

410
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:11,214
The scientists took him away after that.

411
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:14,926
Wait. Maybe if I tell Justin about Martin...

412
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,511
I mean, I could try...

413
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:20,932
Tim, you've got to have the courage
to follow your heart.

414
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:23,059
I'll say hi for you when I get back to NIMH.

415
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:24,894
You mean when we get there.

416
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:27,313
I have to save my brother.

417
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:32,527
Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!

418
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:35,030
What in the name of Nicodemus?

419
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:39,034
She's gone into the canal!
And Tim is with her!

420
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:41,995
Go! Get the others!
I'll catch them at the bridge!

421
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:51,379
Okay, party's over!

422
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,256
What the...

423
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,885
Well, what do you know?

424
00:27:56,926 --> 00:28:00,055
We must stop them!
For Thorn Valley's sake!

425
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:03,475
Spread out. They won't get far.

426
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,186
-I'll take the left!
-I'll go this way!

427
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,025
What...

428
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,652
Well, I'll be.

429
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,656
You sure you've flown
one of these things before?

430
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,617
Hundreds of times.

431
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,827
From the ground.

432
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:25,038
If we die,

433
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:26,539
I'm going to kill you.

434
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:30,001
We're not gonna die. We're on a mission!

435
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:33,380
Don't worry, Mom and Dad. I'll save you!

436
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:36,591
Even Dr. Valentine can't stop us!

437
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:38,968
NIMH, here we come!

438
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:44,307
I gotta admit, the view's not too shabby.

439
00:29:06,496 --> 00:29:08,164
What was that?

440
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:09,833
I don't know.

441
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:16,214
Hawk!

442
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:21,219
-Hold on!
-Tim!

443
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:23,013
-Jenny!
-I'm falling!

444
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,851
-Look out!
-Here he comes!

445
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:29,019
It'll be okay!

446
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:33,523
-Hang on!
-He's coming!

447
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,817
Look out!

448
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:38,778
He's after me!

449
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:44,367
What a ride!

450
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:46,578
I told you, if we died...

451
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:48,705
Hey, we're still alive.

452
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:50,582
Not for long.

453
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:57,589
Any more bright ideas?

454
00:29:57,672 --> 00:29:59,758
Just one. Run!

455
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,219
Hurry, Tim! In there!

456
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:20,195
And don't come back!

457
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:26,242
-Is he gone?
-He is now.

458
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:28,578
What was that?

459
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,581
I don't know, and I don't want to know.

460
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:36,419
-Anything around here look familiar?
-No.

461
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:40,090
We'll never get to NIMH
before the full moon.

462
00:30:40,131 --> 00:30:42,175
My mom and dad are doomed.

463
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:46,262
Poor Martin.

464
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:50,141
We can look for the Great Owl.
That's what my mom said to do.

465
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:55,146
Birds, bugs and beasts, stir your stumps!

466
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:58,108
Come and see the Great Owl!

467
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:02,153
I don't care if you wear flesh,
fins or feathers.

468
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:06,616
You got a problem,
the Owl's the fowl with the answer.

469
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:14,791
Not so fast, short stuff.
The way it works is this.

470
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:19,838
You want something from the Owl,
you gotta have something for the Owl.

471
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:21,798
How about this?

472
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,341
A twig?

473
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:28,471
We're in a forest, and you bring a twig?

474
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:30,932
What's next, a leaf?

475
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:32,267
Some dirt?

476
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:35,854
Beat it, kid. Go find a nice trap to play in.

477
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:39,482
-Who are you, anyway?
-The name's Cecil.

478
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:40,900
I'm the Owl's

479
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:43,820
spokesbug, you might say.

480
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:46,740
You wanna see him, you gotta deal with...

481
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:49,993
The Owl.

482
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:51,327
Now.

483
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:53,913
Easy on the tootsie, tootsie.

484
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:57,000
I paid good money for this pedicure.

485
00:31:57,042 --> 00:32:00,253
In there! Mention my name,
you'll get a good seat.

486
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:03,631
I'm going in.

487
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:13,391
This is marvelous.

488
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:17,520
By the full moon
I'll have an army of animals ready.

489
00:32:17,562 --> 00:32:21,358
Now, you brainless furballs
can be my personal servants.

490
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:24,027
Pass the hat, cat.

491
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,487
Yes, my liege. Yes, my evilship.

492
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:28,615
That's Dr. Valentine to you!

493
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:33,912
Dare I say, it wasn't bad at all, actually.

494
00:32:33,995 --> 00:32:35,747
Yes...

495
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,458
Yes, Dr. Valentine, sire.

496
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:46,716
One by one,
the last pieces fall neatly into place.

497
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:52,263
Back off, bozo.
You know I look lousy in a hat.

498
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:53,598
Floyd, no! Not that!

499
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:57,727
No! My hair! Please, no! It's not even my...

500
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:10,657
Anyone here?

501
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:14,828
Tim, be careful!

502
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:18,164
Did you bring your tribute?
Maybe a sparkly?

503
00:33:19,332 --> 00:33:20,667
-No.
-What?

504
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:22,836
Then begone with you!

505
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,546
I'm not going away.

506
00:33:25,213 --> 00:33:28,508
You dare challenge the Great Owl?

507
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:31,928
No. I just need your help.

508
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:36,558
Who... I mean, who goes there?

509
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:39,602
My name is Timothy Brisby.

510
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:42,313
Really? I knew a Timothy Brisby once.

511
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:45,275
I mean, who is this Timothy Brisby?

512
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:50,280
That smarts.

513
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:52,490
How'd that happen?

514
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:54,576
Help me out of this.

515
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:56,953
Hi, Timmy. Remember me?

516
00:33:57,454 --> 00:34:00,457
-Jeremy?
-Yeah, it's me.

517
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,125
Long time, no see.

518
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:05,920
-Say, could you help me out of this?
-Sure thing.

519
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,465
Run for it, Tim!

520
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:11,217
Hey, do I look like a piñata?

521
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:14,137
Actually, Jeremy, you do.

522
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:17,974
Wait. Hold on. You know this guy?

523
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,645
-Yeah, he's my friend.
-All right. I'll take it from here.

524
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:24,647
What's going on here?

525
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:27,817
Zipper it before you say something stupid.

526
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:29,694
Make that "stupider."

527
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:31,821
And you two, take a seat.

528
00:34:31,863 --> 00:34:35,492
I'm gonna tell you
what the Great Owl can do for you.

529
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:44,834
<i>He'll solve your problems
He'll tell your future</i>

530
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:47,420
<i>He'll work it out
So it's bound to suit you</i>

531
00:34:47,504 --> 00:34:50,006
<i>He'll read your stars and read your mind</i>

532
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:52,550
<i>And he'll find the way you should go</i>

533
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:55,845
<i>Take the chance of a lifetime</i>

534
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:58,014
<i>Find out what you should know</i>

535
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:01,017
<i>A quite sensational, inspirational</i>

536
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:03,353
<i>Magic mystery show</i>

537
00:35:03,395 --> 00:35:06,314
<i>A fortune-telling, a magic-spelling</i>

538
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:07,524
<i>A doubt-dispelling</i>

539
00:35:07,565 --> 00:35:09,150
<i>A snake oil-selling</i>

540
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:10,276
<i>A conjuration</i>

541
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,403
<i>A celebration</i>

542
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:14,406
<i>So start the party, let's go</i>

543
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:17,117

545
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,038

<i>Magic mystery show</i>

547
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:27,627
<i>When life is grim and things are drastic</i>

548
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:30,088
<i>Just see me and all's fantastic</i>

549
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:32,966
<i>As for payment, he's elastic</i>

550
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:35,719
<i>He takes cash or gifts, or plastic</i>

551
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,388

00:35:38,471 --> 00:35:40,724

00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:51,526
<i>What's more perfect for two old hams?</i>

556
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:54,320
<i>We supply the mumbo jumbo
They supply the clams</i>

557
00:35:56,364 --> 00:35:58,742
-Can you fly us to NIMH?
-Man, feel that groove!

558
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,287
What's a "groove"?

559
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:03,997
This is cool.

560
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:07,625
-What did Jeremy say?
-"Man, feel that groove."

561
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:10,170
<i>He'll solve your problems
He'll tell your future</i>

Your wig!

582
00:37:02,847 --> 00:37:07,852
Wait! That was for your own good.
An illusion. Show business.

583
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:10,897
Thanks, folks. Drive home safely.

584
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:15,360
Have you no mercy

585
00:37:15,443 --> 00:37:17,987
for a poor, featherless

586
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:19,989
molting crow?

587
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:21,700
I mean, owl.

588
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:23,660
Molting?

589
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:25,829
Get that crow!

590
00:37:25,912 --> 00:37:28,790
Yeah! Get that crow!

591
00:37:32,502 --> 00:37:33,837
Get out of Dodge!

592
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:36,881
Jenny! Tim! Where are you?

593
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:38,466
Cecil! Jeremy!

594
00:37:38,508 --> 00:37:40,343
Hey, over here!

595
00:37:42,262 --> 00:37:44,597
-My hand!
-Always leave them wanting!

596
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:49,853
What were you doing in the forest anyway?

597
00:37:49,936 --> 00:37:52,188
We're going to see my parents.

598
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:54,399
Jenny, this is Jeremy.

599
00:37:54,482 --> 00:37:58,820
He's the one who flew me
to Thorn Valley a long time ago.

600
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:02,949
Happy to be the pilot.
Would that be first class or coach?

601
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:05,952
There's some crackers
in the nape of my neck.

602
00:38:07,454 --> 00:38:09,456
This is great, isn't it?

603
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:13,668
Wind in your face, bugs in your teeth,
not a care in the world.

604
00:38:14,544 --> 00:38:15,837
There it is.

605
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:33,021
Jeepers creepers.

606
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:35,732
What a... What a spooky place.

607
00:38:35,815 --> 00:38:38,068
So, where are we anyway?

608
00:38:38,276 --> 00:38:40,028
It's NIMH.

609
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:43,531
NIMH! What? Anyplace but NIMH!

610
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:45,658
I should've been told.

611
00:38:46,284 --> 00:38:49,954
Okey-dokey, that's it. Last stop.

612
00:38:50,038 --> 00:38:52,582
Everybody, get off my back.

613
00:38:52,624 --> 00:38:54,918
You are on your own, kids.

614
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:58,755
What they do to animals in that place...

615
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:00,590
If I go in there,

616
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:03,259
I'll never make butterfly.

617
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:08,598
That's it. I'm not going one feether farther.

618
00:39:08,682 --> 00:39:10,850
One farther further.

619
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:12,310
One feather farther.

620
00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:14,729
I gotta get out of here.

621
00:39:25,615 --> 00:39:28,785
-I can't get it open.
-Come on, let's go.

622
00:39:28,868 --> 00:39:31,871
Hurry, Tim. We got no time to waste.

623
00:39:34,207 --> 00:39:35,291
This way.

624
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:42,549
So this is NIMH.

625
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:46,845
Wow, this is really creepy.

626
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:56,855
Come on, let's go.

627
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:09,617
Jenny, look! What happened to them?

628
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:11,411
Dr. Valentine is mad.

629
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,706
He's turned the humans into dogs.

630
00:40:15,874 --> 00:40:19,669
Come on. Let's find my parents
and get out of here.

631
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:34,851
-It's so quiet.
-Too quiet.

632
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:48,239
Someone's coming!

633
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:56,331
Left, left. Left, right, left.

634
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:02,379
Those are the biggest rats
I've ever seen in my life.

635
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:04,673
Yeah, well, keep an eye out.

636
00:41:04,714 --> 00:41:08,134
There are bigger creatures
than that in here.

637
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:19,062
Thanks.

638
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:25,527
Come on.

639
00:41:50,051 --> 00:41:51,136
There.

640
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:55,724
Wait.

641
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,186
-Run, Jenny, run!
-Hold on, Tim!

642
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:04,149
-It's okay.
-Justin? What are you doing here?

643
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:05,984
We decided Jenny's right.

644
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:08,778
The lost six belong in Thorn Valley.

645
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:11,197
So we came here to help rescue them.

646
00:42:12,532 --> 00:42:14,284
-Watch our backs.
-Not again!

647
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:15,952
Will you listen?

648
00:42:17,454 --> 00:42:19,330
Fine. Leave me behind.

649
00:42:19,414 --> 00:42:21,416
I'm going to look for my brother.

650
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:24,294
Martin? Martin, where are you?

651
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:31,634
Mom! Dad! You're all right!

652
00:42:31,676 --> 00:42:34,304
Jenny! You shouldn't have come back.

653
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:38,558
The moon is full tonight.
We're all in danger.

654
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:40,393
We'll have you all out in a second.

655
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:45,106
Justin. Is that really you?

656
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:46,274
To the rescue.

657
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,652
Let's get you out of here.

658
00:42:50,987 --> 00:42:53,656
I'm so sorry. Did I startle you?

659
00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:01,331
-Tim! Cats!
-No!

660
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:05,251
<i>Three blind mice
See how they shan't run...</i>

661
00:43:05,502 --> 00:43:08,505
Man. Why didn't I listen?

662
00:43:10,131 --> 00:43:13,843
No, you don't.
No, my little scrumptious scone.

663
00:43:13,968 --> 00:43:15,428
Come here.

664
00:43:16,096 --> 00:43:17,847
What the...

665
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:19,683
What are you thinking?

666
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:23,520
But they make such a lovely stew.
A few carrots, some nice greens...

667
00:43:23,603 --> 00:43:28,983
The good doctor will make a stew out of us
if we hurt them.

668
00:43:29,025 --> 00:43:33,196
I don't want to hurt him.
I merely want to eat him.

669
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:40,370
I'm sorry, everybody. It's my fault.

670
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:43,248
I wasn't a team player.

671
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:46,334
Here you go, boss.

672
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:50,005
Dr. Valentine!

673
00:43:50,046 --> 00:43:53,258
-More recruits!
-Yes, and we didn't eat any.

674
00:43:53,341 --> 00:43:57,053
-I wanted to make a lovely stew...
-Put a sock in it!

675
00:43:59,055 --> 00:44:01,725
Dr. Valentine, fetch!

676
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:08,732
Little Timothy,

677
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:10,942
how you have grown.

678
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:12,485
Who...

679
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:14,571
You bruise me.

680
00:44:14,612 --> 00:44:19,743
I suppose I have changed a bit.
But for the better, don't you think,

681
00:44:20,201 --> 00:44:21,411
hero?

682
00:44:21,661 --> 00:44:22,746
Martin?

683
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:28,418
Not quite, brother.
It's me, the new-and-improved Martin.

684
00:44:29,044 --> 00:44:32,088
What's wrong? What's happened to you?

685
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:36,343
Happened?
Why, life happened, that's what!

686
00:44:36,426 --> 00:44:39,721
And I made the most of it. Don't you think?

687
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:49,022
<i>I was far too smart</i>

688
00:44:49,105 --> 00:44:51,107
<i>From the very start</i>

689
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:53,485
<i>Because our father</i>

690
00:44:53,568 --> 00:44:55,862
<i>Came from NIMH</i>

691
00:44:56,154 --> 00:44:58,531
<i>I began to grow</i>

692
00:44:58,948 --> 00:45:00,700
<i>Little did he know</i>

693
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:05,038
<i>I had my own plans for him</i>

694
00:45:06,414 --> 00:45:07,916
<i>He thought I was tame</i>

695
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:09,751
<i>Just my little game</i>

696
00:45:10,043 --> 00:45:13,463
<i>And this all became mine!</i>

697
00:45:15,465 --> 00:45:16,633
What?

698
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:20,136
<i>They all do as I say
No one stands in my way</i>

699
00:45:20,178 --> 00:45:23,723
<i>Everybody here is happy
Or I have them slightly altered</i>

700
00:45:23,807 --> 00:45:27,143
<i>I can do as I please
I can change things with ease</i>

701
00:45:27,227 --> 00:45:30,647
<i>Horns, hair, fin or feather
I control the wind and weather</i>

702
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:33,650
<i>We can rule the world together
If you come with me</i>

703
00:45:34,192 --> 00:45:35,985
<i>You'll be happy</i>

704
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:37,529
<i>Oh, so happy</i>

705
00:45:37,654 --> 00:45:41,282
<i>When you come with me</i>

706
00:45:41,324 --> 00:45:42,992
<i>You'll be king of</i>

707
00:45:43,076 --> 00:45:44,786
<i>Everything of</i>

708
00:45:44,828 --> 00:45:47,414
<i>All that you can see</i>

709
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:51,876
-Just say yes, hero.
-No!

710
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,338
<i>Think what we two can do
You and me, me and you</i>

711
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,843
<i>Buck up, don't look so sad
We'll have more than dear old Dad had</i>

712
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:03,346
<i>Butterflies and pretty flowers</i>

713
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,974
<i>Sunny skies and super powers</i>

714
00:46:06,016 --> 00:46:08,351
<i>Silver streams and fluffy kitties</i>

715
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:11,604
<i>Laser beams and rubble cities</i>

716
00:46:13,023 --> 00:46:14,691
Dad wasn't crazy!

717
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:18,528
<i>Take your chance while you can
Join in my master plan</i>

718
00:46:18,611 --> 00:46:20,196
<i>You won't tell me I'm too nabby</i>

719
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,825
<i>When I'm ruler of Thorn Valley!</i>

720
00:46:25,785 --> 00:46:29,205
<i>All of it will be mine
Every day will be fine</i>

721
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:30,707
<i>All the trains will run on time</i>

722
00:46:30,749 --> 00:46:32,667
<i>There'll be no more wars and crime</i>

723
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:36,171
<i>I'll reduce your brain to slime
Unless you say yes!</i>

724
00:46:36,212 --> 00:46:37,881
<i>You'll be happy</i>

725
00:46:37,964 --> 00:46:39,591
<i>Oh, so happy</i>

726
00:46:39,674 --> 00:46:42,427
<i>If you just say yes</i>

727
00:46:42,552 --> 00:46:43,803
<i>Oh, poor fellow</i>

728
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:45,764
<i>Mind like Jell-O</i>

729
00:46:46,181 --> 00:46:48,975
<i>Such a nasty mess</i>

730
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:52,562
<i>Come on in to the greatest kind of life</i>

731
00:46:52,645 --> 00:46:55,815
<i>To the best and the latest kind of life</i>

732
00:46:56,232 --> 00:46:57,817
<i>You'll be happy</i>

733
00:46:57,901 --> 00:46:59,527
<i>Nice and happy</i>

734
00:46:59,569 --> 00:47:02,155
<i>Perfect happiness</i>

735
00:47:02,238 --> 00:47:03,865
<i>Beyond measure</i>

736
00:47:03,907 --> 00:47:05,533
<i>Purest pleasure</i>

737
00:47:05,575 --> 00:47:08,119
<i>If you just say yes!</i>

738
00:47:08,203 --> 00:47:09,204
No!

739
00:47:09,245 --> 00:47:11,498
<i>It's our chance to rule, don't let it slip away</i>

740
00:47:11,581 --> 00:47:13,375
<i>Don't be upset, it won't hurt much</i>

741
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:16,419
<i>You won't regret it if you just say yes</i>

742
00:47:19,255 --> 00:47:21,132
<i>Just say yes</i>

743
00:47:22,217 --> 00:47:23,259
No!

744
00:47:23,843 --> 00:47:25,303
Wrong answer.

745
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:29,683
I say, I've caught a mouse.

746
00:47:30,266 --> 00:47:31,434
Hi.

747
00:47:33,812 --> 00:47:36,231
May I devour him, your vileness?

748
00:47:36,439 --> 00:47:37,482
No!

749
00:47:38,733 --> 00:47:42,195
For now, maybe something
a bit more accommodating

750
00:47:42,278 --> 00:47:45,323
for a long lost brother.

751
00:47:46,449 --> 00:47:49,828
I know! A ringside seat.

752
00:47:49,911 --> 00:47:52,747
So you can watch me
unfurl my master plan!

753
00:47:53,456 --> 00:47:57,377
Tonight, the moon is full,
and I attack Thorn Valley!

754
00:47:57,627 --> 00:48:02,757
Your soon-to-be-zapped friends
will be my willing soldiers.

755
00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:03,967
Quite a shock.

756
00:48:04,467 --> 00:48:05,635
No pun intended.

757
00:48:05,802 --> 00:48:07,262
You're insane!

758
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:10,974
Thank you. Now, she has real spunk.

759
00:48:11,558 --> 00:48:13,643
Not like you, hero.

760
00:48:13,727 --> 00:48:15,854
She has real potential.

761
00:48:15,979 --> 00:48:18,440
Take her to my personal chamber.

762
00:48:21,192 --> 00:48:23,820
Put me down, you feline freak!

763
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:27,741
She'll make a perfect queen
for my new realm.

764
00:48:27,824 --> 00:48:31,619
Her attitude just needs a slight alteration.

765
00:48:31,661 --> 00:48:33,621
Place the rest with their friends.

766
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:36,291
After all, they have much in common.

767
00:48:36,332 --> 00:48:37,667
No future.

768
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:40,670
You'll be happy to note that this cage

769
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:44,341
was one of our father's particular favorites.

770
00:48:44,424 --> 00:48:46,509
See you soon, brother.

771
00:48:47,344 --> 00:48:49,804
Then again, maybe not.

772
00:48:49,888 --> 00:48:52,182
Martin, don't do this!

773
00:48:55,769 --> 00:48:57,103
This is all my fault.

774
00:48:57,979 --> 00:48:59,356
Why didn't I listen?

775
00:49:05,528 --> 00:49:09,991
<i>One day they'll know me</i>

776
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:14,079
<i>They'll hear what I've done</i>

777
00:49:15,705 --> 00:49:19,250
<i>I will show the world</i>

778
00:49:20,543 --> 00:49:24,172
<i>I'm my father's...</i>

779
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:28,385
Bet you're proud of me now, Dad.

780
00:49:29,761 --> 00:49:33,223
<i>What can I do?</i>

781
00:49:33,306 --> 00:49:36,059
<i>What have I done?</i>

782
00:49:36,726 --> 00:49:42,482
<i>I've only managed to hurt everyone</i>

783
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:49,948
<i>Why did I think I could ever be any good?</i>

784
00:49:50,031 --> 00:49:54,244
<i>Why'd you have me for a son?</i>

785
00:49:56,663 --> 00:50:02,127
<i>What I have done can't be mended</i>

786
00:50:03,086 --> 00:50:09,718
<i>All you've begun I have ended</i>

787
00:50:09,759 --> 00:50:12,595
<i>So much I'll never say</i>

788
00:50:12,846 --> 00:50:15,849
<i>So much to throw away</i>

789
00:50:16,307 --> 00:50:22,272
<i>All I had is gone</i>

790
00:50:23,023 --> 00:50:25,859
<i>So much to say to you</i>

791
00:50:25,942 --> 00:50:29,821
<i>So much to share with you</i>

792
00:50:29,904 --> 00:50:36,036
<i>All I had is gone</i>

793
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:41,207
<i>All I had</i>

794
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:48,131
<i>Is gone</i>

795
00:50:58,391 --> 00:51:00,602
Very nice.

796
00:51:02,062 --> 00:51:05,106
You'll make someone
a nice doormat someday.

797
00:51:05,565 --> 00:51:08,610
Cecil? What are you doing here?

798
00:51:09,235 --> 00:51:11,071
Heroes have sidekicks, don't they?

799
00:51:11,905 --> 00:51:13,907
Hero? Me?

800
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:15,367
Yeah, right.

801
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:19,537
I'm the one who got us into this mess.

802
00:51:19,621 --> 00:51:23,124
So maybe they won't give you the key
to the city.

803
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:27,420
But the last time I checked,
no one's perfect.

804
00:51:27,504 --> 00:51:29,005
What did you say?

805
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:34,219
-"No one's perfect"?
-No. The key.

806
00:51:37,138 --> 00:51:38,181
You never know.

807
00:51:40,975 --> 00:51:43,436
-That key in that lock?
-Can't reach.

808
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,105
Come on.

809
00:51:46,147 --> 00:51:50,610
If I could just get this hinge pin out!

810
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:52,529
Yeah, right.

811
00:51:54,864 --> 00:51:56,324
Not bad.

812
00:51:59,494 --> 00:52:00,787
So, what are you waiting for?

813
00:52:01,538 --> 00:52:02,997
Applause?

814
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:04,708
A candygram maybe?

815
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:07,043
I've learned to listen.

816
00:52:07,085 --> 00:52:10,088
-I'm thinking things through.
-A plan!

817
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:13,341
There's a concept.

818
00:52:19,597 --> 00:52:22,183
Roasted rack of rat.

819
00:52:26,563 --> 00:52:28,690
Rodent ratatouille.

820
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:30,275
Surprise!

821
00:52:32,068 --> 00:52:33,069
Come back!

822
00:52:33,111 --> 00:52:35,071
You almost scared me to death!

823
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:43,830
You call yourselves cats?
You can't catch me!

824
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:48,793
Now you've done it!

825
00:52:50,462 --> 00:52:52,422
Let me at him! Where'd he go?

826
00:52:53,423 --> 00:52:55,175
Excuse me. Going down?

827
00:52:57,427 --> 00:53:00,764
-There!
-Get him! There he is!

828
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:02,724
Get him!

829
00:53:04,934 --> 00:53:07,979
Now I have you! Now I have you!

830
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,691
Let me at him!

831
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:13,610
I'll show you how to do it.

832
00:53:13,693 --> 00:53:15,904
Come on, little mousy.

833
00:53:15,945 --> 00:53:18,782
I need that tail to use it as a toothpick.

834
00:53:26,456 --> 00:53:29,250
Cecil! Quick!

835
00:53:29,876 --> 00:53:31,252
Hold your horseflies.

836
00:53:31,294 --> 00:53:33,588
I've only got four hands!

837
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:37,634
Hello again!

838
00:53:43,473 --> 00:53:46,017
-Move it! Gadzooks!
-I'm stuck!

839
00:53:48,728 --> 00:53:50,814
-See you!
-I was just kidding.

840
00:53:51,648 --> 00:53:55,610
I blame you for this, Muriel!

841
00:53:56,444 --> 00:53:57,987
Thanks for the hand.

842
00:53:58,029 --> 00:54:00,824
Don't mention it, sidekick.

843
00:54:02,325 --> 00:54:07,872
How's this for adapt and improvise?
Gotta help the others. Let's go!

844
00:54:09,874 --> 00:54:11,501
Stay away from me!

845
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:13,003
Jenny!

846
00:54:14,004 --> 00:54:18,675
Go help Justin and the lost six.
I'll go after Jenny. I'm coming!

847
00:54:18,717 --> 00:54:20,927
I'll never be your queen.

848
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:23,513
Let me go!

849
00:54:23,555 --> 00:54:26,182
-I'm warning you!
-Martin!

850
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:29,394
Hero! You escaped. How clever.

851
00:54:29,477 --> 00:54:30,687
You're hurting her!

852
00:54:30,979 --> 00:54:32,814
Oh, poo!

853
00:54:32,856 --> 00:54:35,400
I assure you, electrocerebral enhancement

854
00:54:35,483 --> 00:54:38,445
is absolutely painless.

855
00:54:39,195 --> 00:54:41,031
-Look at me.
-Let her go!

856
00:54:42,365 --> 00:54:43,533
Now!

857
00:54:44,034 --> 00:54:47,328
Please. I may be crazy, but I'm not stupid.

858
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:49,414
You couldn't hit water
if you fell out of a boat.

859
00:54:51,791 --> 00:54:53,335
I've been practicing.

860
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:56,880
Quick, Tim. We've got to save my parents.

861
00:54:56,921 --> 00:54:58,173
Look out!

862
00:54:59,049 --> 00:55:01,384
Stand still, will you?

863
00:55:05,138 --> 00:55:06,890
Listen to me.

864
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:10,060
Whatever they've done to you,
we can make you well again.

865
00:55:10,143 --> 00:55:11,895
How many times must I tell you?

866
00:55:11,978 --> 00:55:14,314
I am not the do-ee!

867
00:55:14,397 --> 00:55:16,483
I am the doer!

868
00:55:16,566 --> 00:55:18,068
Run, Jenny! Save the others!

869
00:55:18,151 --> 00:55:20,070
-You hurt me.
-I'm sorry.

870
00:55:20,111 --> 00:55:25,241
Of course you're sorry.
Everybody's sorry, after it's too late.

871
00:55:27,535 --> 00:55:30,163
Say hello to Dad for me, okay?

872
00:55:30,246 --> 00:55:33,958
-You don't want to do this!
-You're right.

873
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:37,253
But the new and improved Martin does!

874
00:55:41,549 --> 00:55:45,053
That's for being so evil.
Read them and weep.

875
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:49,265
Come on, Tim, before he wakes up.

876
00:55:50,517 --> 00:55:53,436
-Someone's coming.
-Quick! Behind the books.

877
00:55:56,314 --> 00:55:57,607
Excuse the interruption.

878
00:55:57,816 --> 00:56:01,945
The men await flight instructions
for the invasion of Thorn Valley.

879
00:56:03,363 --> 00:56:07,033
<i>Tim, you've got to adapt and improvise.</i>

880
00:56:07,325 --> 00:56:08,535
Sir?

881
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:12,288
Oh, goody.

882
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:16,543
Just head north by north by north,
as the crow flies.

883
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,169
And good hunting.

884
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:19,713
Sir!

885
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:30,140
That was great. How'd you think of that?

886
00:56:30,223 --> 00:56:31,766
Well, let's see if it worked.

887
00:56:34,561 --> 00:56:37,814
It did. They're going in the wrong direction.

888
00:56:38,189 --> 00:56:39,232
Come on!

889
00:56:41,818 --> 00:56:42,986
Oh, Martin.

890
00:56:50,869 --> 00:56:54,873
-How will we open the cages?
-Don't worry. I've got a plan.

891
00:56:54,956 --> 00:56:57,083
I'm seeing the big picture.

892
00:56:59,085 --> 00:57:00,211
You finished yet, Cecil?

893
00:57:00,503 --> 00:57:03,465
Just one more second.

894
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:07,177
-There!
-Nice work.

895
00:57:07,218 --> 00:57:09,179
Quickly now. Quickly.

896
00:57:09,596 --> 00:57:11,473
Mom? Mom!

897
00:57:11,514 --> 00:57:14,059
Jenny! Where are you?

898
00:57:14,142 --> 00:57:17,520
-Mom.
-I'm okay.

899
00:57:17,604 --> 00:57:19,439
-Dad.
-Jenny.

900
00:57:20,815 --> 00:57:22,692
Nice work, Cec.

901
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:25,779
Hey, Sidekicks "R" Us.

902
00:57:25,862 --> 00:57:28,198
-Know what I'm saying?
-Come on!

903
00:57:28,656 --> 00:57:29,866
Follow Tim, folks.

904
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:34,454
Come on, people. To the door.
Let's move quickly.

905
00:57:34,537 --> 00:57:37,248
-Let me help.
-Put your back into it.

906
00:57:37,624 --> 00:57:38,750
Pull!

907
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:45,215
Come on. This way!

908
00:57:45,298 --> 00:57:46,883
Let's go.

909
00:57:47,384 --> 00:57:49,594
-Run for cover!
-I'll climb up.

910
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:51,513
Brutus, the window!

911
00:57:51,763 --> 00:57:55,016
Help them up the rope.
We'll meet at the top.

912
00:57:55,058 --> 00:57:58,561
-Mrs. McBride, you're first.
-Go, Mom.

913
00:57:58,603 --> 00:58:00,855
Come on, move your tail!

914
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:04,275
That's everyone, Justin!

915
00:58:07,737 --> 00:58:10,115
Cecil, take my hand.

916
00:58:10,198 --> 00:58:11,783
Gee, thanks.

917
00:58:11,866 --> 00:58:14,119
I'll add it to my collection.

918
00:58:14,411 --> 00:58:15,912
Tim, you...

919
00:58:15,995 --> 00:58:18,581
You did a good job.

920
00:58:18,665 --> 00:58:20,083
For a mouse.

921
00:58:20,166 --> 00:58:22,043
Let's get out of here.

922
00:58:23,294 --> 00:58:24,796
After you.

923
00:58:28,341 --> 00:58:29,801
Martin.

924
00:58:29,926 --> 00:58:32,012
-Promise me something.
-Anything.

925
00:58:32,095 --> 00:58:33,847
Don't come after me.

926
00:58:39,352 --> 00:58:41,813
Tim! Where are you going?

927
00:58:41,938 --> 00:58:44,691
Just what you said! Following my heart!

928
00:58:44,774 --> 00:58:46,109
I love you!

929
00:58:46,192 --> 00:58:47,777
I love you, too!

930
00:58:59,622 --> 00:59:02,667
Surprise! You're mice mousse, mouse.

931
00:59:02,751 --> 00:59:05,587
How many lives
do you guys have, anyway?

932
00:59:07,339 --> 00:59:08,506
Race you to the elevator.

933
00:59:09,007 --> 00:59:10,592
Get him, Floyd!

934
00:59:10,967 --> 00:59:13,511
When I get you, you're going to be mince...

935
00:59:14,804 --> 00:59:16,306
Have a nice trip!

936
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:18,808
I've always loved you, Muriel!

937
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:21,269
Shut up, Floyd!

938
00:59:23,521 --> 00:59:24,939
Hero.

939
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:28,026
You dropped this.

940
00:59:33,323 --> 00:59:34,949
I'm here, Martin.

941
01:00:19,911 --> 01:00:22,539
You should've skipped a few desserts.

942
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,223
What the...

943
01:00:40,807 --> 01:00:42,892
We better pull back, chief!

944
01:00:43,643 --> 01:00:45,603
Come on, Martin, we can make it.

945
01:01:13,298 --> 01:01:14,966
Jeremy?

946
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:18,928
So, don't you guys know flying
without wings is against the law?

947
01:01:20,138 --> 01:01:21,931
I thought you were scared of NIMH.

948
01:01:22,015 --> 01:01:25,018
Yeah, I used to, but no more now.

949
01:01:28,646 --> 01:01:32,067
Life is to live.
Come on, let's get out of here.

950
01:01:32,108 --> 01:01:34,277
Did the others get out okay?

951
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:38,281
Their fur may be singed,
but of course they did.

952
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:51,628
<i>You'll wanna play ball
And hit a home run</i>

953
01:01:51,711 --> 01:01:55,256
<i>You'll wanna play loud
You could be number one</i>

954
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:58,510
<i>To aim for the stars
You set your sights high</i>

955
01:01:59,094 --> 01:02:03,390
<i>You won't know if it works until you try</i>

956
01:02:05,892 --> 01:02:09,062
Is that him? He looks so grown-up.

957
01:02:09,145 --> 01:02:10,814
You made it home!

958
01:02:11,898 --> 01:02:13,149
He looks so like his father.

959
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:17,487
-We love you, Tim!
-You were there when we needed you!

960
01:02:17,529 --> 01:02:18,822
Martin!

961
01:02:18,863 --> 01:02:22,158
-You're my hero!
-Hooray, Tim!

962
01:02:23,326 --> 01:02:25,662
-You did it!
-Doesn't he look great?

963
01:02:25,745 --> 01:02:28,164
-My brother!
-Attaboy! Good job!

964
01:02:28,289 --> 01:02:31,960
Martin, you're back to your old self.

965
01:02:32,293 --> 01:02:34,295
I've got my brother back.

966
01:02:38,508 --> 01:02:39,926
Sorry, hero.

967
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:42,595
I don't know what came over me.

968
01:02:42,679 --> 01:02:46,016
Forget it, Martin. And don't call me hero.

969
01:02:46,099 --> 01:02:47,934
Why not?

970
01:02:48,018 --> 01:02:51,312
You single-handedly saved Thorn Valley.

971
01:02:51,354 --> 01:02:53,231
Martin is correct, Timothy.

972
01:02:53,314 --> 01:02:56,026
The prophecy of Nicodemus came true.

973
01:02:56,067 --> 01:02:59,195
You have, indeed, fulfilled your destiny.

974
01:03:12,876 --> 01:03:14,085
It's me.

975
01:03:14,961 --> 01:03:17,922
Dad would've been proud, hero.

976
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:22,427
<i>To the greatest mind</i>
