1
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:32,929
We're reporting live here

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,900
in Lucas Valley outside
Senator Wyman's mansion...

3
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,497
where a tense,
ongoing hostage situation

4
00:00:38,498 --> 00:00:40,332
has been unfolding for hours now...

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,673
Were on the scene with a breaking...

6
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Wyman's mansion involving as well.

7
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,596
Right now I'm standing outside
the mansion of Senator Wyman where...

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,297
Right now we have the-
the bomb squad showed up uh...

9
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,646
FBI and the ATF and uh, we...

10
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,542
Hey get Medivac in here now.

11
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:38,538
I need another team
of sharpshooters.

12
00:02:59,108 --> 00:03:01,101
I'm disappointed in you Detective.

13
00:03:01,276 --> 00:03:03,484
You've had over two hours
to wire that money.

14
00:03:03,654 --> 00:03:06,939
You just don't withdraw a hundred
million dollars out of an ATM machine.

15
00:03:07,117 --> 00:03:08,574
It's not that easy.

16
00:03:08,743 --> 00:03:11,577
Besides, my people want assurances
the senator's okay.

17
00:03:11,745 --> 00:03:13,205
You think I care?

18
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:15,864
You have fifteen minutes
to make that transfer happen.

19
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,200
God.

20
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:19,955
All right people, standby.

21
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:22,003
Nobody fire until you
hear my signal.

22
00:03:22,172 --> 00:03:25,042
There's more than money at stake here.
The senator's counting on us.

23
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,795
Bomb squad en route.

24
00:03:28,178 --> 00:03:31,382
Call for TJ see if he's close.
I got my hands full up here.

25
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:33,924
- Glass, what's your ETA?
- Twenty seconds.

26
00:03:34,935 --> 00:03:36,513
We got a situation here.

27
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:38,222
Guy named Milos.

28
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:39,980
Balkan terrorist.

29
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:42,604
He's already killed three hostages,
and now he's rigged a bomb...

30
00:03:42,777 --> 00:03:44,152
- in the basement.
- Milos?

31
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,062
He's very dangerous.
Watch your back.

32
00:03:47,782 --> 00:03:49,275
Okay we're droppin' down.

33
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:51,443
I need sharpshooters covering us.

34
00:03:56,581 --> 00:03:57,862
It's up to you, Glass.

35
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,750
It's all up to you.

36
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:03,837
Okay man, get ready to drop.

37
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:09,714
Five seconds.

38
00:05:09,154 --> 00:05:10,696
Glass, talk to me.

39
00:05:10,863 --> 00:05:13,319
- What's goin' on?
- Entering basement. Nothing yet.

40
00:05:16,368 --> 00:05:17,283
Over here.

41
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:26,746
- Hey Lieutenant, over here.
- I think we found something.

42
00:05:36,806 --> 00:05:39,343
Okay. Looks like we got
ourselves a detonator.

43
00:05:40,851 --> 00:05:41,598
Glass.

44
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:43,091
We're running out of time.

45
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:45,637
I got a countdown, one minute...

46
00:05:45,815 --> 00:05:47,272
forty-two seconds.

47
00:05:51,152 --> 00:05:53,442
Listen up people.
No one fire.

48
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:55,072
Wait for my signal.

49
00:05:57,242 --> 00:05:58,654
Shooters

50
00:06:02,123 --> 00:06:03,320
What the hell's going on?

51
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:06,994
Hold your fire dammit.

52
00:06:08,545 --> 00:06:09,410
Hold your fire!

53
00:06:10,922 --> 00:06:12,547
You, get your face down!

54
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:28,606
Talk to me Glass.

55
00:06:28,774 --> 00:06:30,765
All hell's breaking loose up here.

56
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,115
Your time is up.

57
00:07:33,712 --> 00:07:36,001
Something's wrong.
It's too easy.

58
00:07:41,637 --> 00:07:43,760
- That was the decoy.
- Okay, get out of there.

59
00:07:51,563 --> 00:07:53,140
Clear the area, that was the decoy.

60
00:08:12,376 --> 00:08:13,751
You are a dead man.

61
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:16,504
Come on, everybody...

62
00:08:16,755 --> 00:08:17,620
Let's go.

63
00:08:31,435 --> 00:08:34,272
Seach out, reach out
and touch someone.

64
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:30,531
- Small gift sir?
- Would you get lost.

65
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,531
There he is, check it out.

66
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,071
Right there.

67
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:37,907
That's right.

68
00:09:38,085 --> 00:09:39,248
Look around.

69
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,665
We see you.

70
00:09:40,838 --> 00:09:42,332
You sure about this guy?

71
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:43,832
Let's do it.

72
00:09:44,008 --> 00:09:45,419
I don't like this guy.

73
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:53,766
You gonna take care of me?

74
00:09:57,021 --> 00:09:58,930
You take care of me
I'll take care of you.

75
00:09:59,314 --> 00:10:00,940
You give me a litle extra,

76
00:10:01,691 --> 00:10:03,732
- I can make some deliveries for ya.
- Yeah.

77
00:10:13,871 --> 00:10:14,866
Show your hands.
Stand up motherfucka.

78
00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:16,912
Hands on your head.
All right big shot.

79
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,031
Turn around.

80
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,164
Hands on your head.

81
00:10:19,334 --> 00:10:20,413
Hands on your head!

82
00:10:25,173 --> 00:10:27,415
Lilly, what the fuck are
you doin' in here?

83
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,208
Nice time with your girlfriend?

84
00:10:29,386 --> 00:10:32,590
I was trying to make some money
for my baby for y'all assholes...

85
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:34,045
- came up in here.
- Yeah? Well I...

86
00:10:34,224 --> 00:10:36,383
thought you were supposed
to be in a fuckin' shelter.

87
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,805
Too many junkies in there.

88
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,811
What, you gonna give me
a place to live?

89
00:10:40,898 --> 00:10:42,807
Ray, what we gonna do
with my girl here, man?

90
00:10:43,025 --> 00:10:45,017
We're gonna bust her and take
her kid to Social Services.

91
00:10:45,193 --> 00:10:46,356
- Or.
- Or What?

92
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:48,105
Or we take her down to
Redemption House.

93
00:10:48,905 --> 00:10:50,530
She'll be back on the
junk in no time.

94
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:51,730
No I promise.

95
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:55,281
The Rehab was goin' good.

96
00:10:55,453 --> 00:10:58,122
I just needed a little extra
help for my baby.

97
00:10:58,665 --> 00:11:00,242
Look, I wanna do right.

98
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:03,376
Just give me a chance.

99
00:11:04,462 --> 00:11:05,162
Please.

100
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:08,458
All right, I see you on the street
again hustlin', for whatever reason,

101
00:11:08,675 --> 00:11:09,754
I'm gonna bust you.

102
00:11:09,926 --> 00:11:11,125
Now come here.

103
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:14,471
I never seen you before.

104
00:11:15,432 --> 00:11:17,258
And I never wanna see you again.

105
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:19,849
- Go, get out of here.
- Thank you.

106
00:11:20,061 --> 00:11:22,054
You're lucky you got a daughter.

107
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:24,064
Sorry Fuzzy.

108
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:26,393
All right big shot,
you're going to jail.

109
00:11:26,568 --> 00:11:28,276
It's like I keep telling you man,

110
00:11:28,445 --> 00:11:30,983
if you want your
detective shield back,

111
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:33,148
you gotta start actin'
like a team player again.

112
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,531
What, working garbage detail
for two years? No thanks.

113
00:11:35,702 --> 00:11:38,407
So that's it, you're just gonna
let your demons win?

114
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,451
- What demons?
- What demons he says.

115
00:11:41,624 --> 00:11:43,617
Only the ones
that's been eatin' you up.

116
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:47,004
Look, all I know is
I can't do this shit anymore.

117
00:11:47,213 --> 00:11:47,959
That's all.

118
00:11:48,131 --> 00:11:48,830
Okay?

119
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,381
You're gonna explode, man.

120
00:11:52,677 --> 00:11:55,002
Let's get a drink.
Let's go explode and get a drink.

121
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,430
TJ, remember that incident
at the senator's mansion last year?

122
00:12:05,273 --> 00:12:06,186
Not good.

123
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,983
What you got on that
computer screen, Captain?

124
00:12:11,571 --> 00:12:12,353
Bad news.

125
00:12:12,989 --> 00:12:14,448
That's an l-R-D.

126
00:12:15,324 --> 00:12:17,151
Instant Retirement Device.

127
00:12:17,325 --> 00:12:20,243
Computerized shifting sensors,
counter-logic traps.

128
00:12:20,872 --> 00:12:23,445
Nastiest class of ticker
I've ever seen.

129
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:26,331
They first showed up in Africa.

130
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:28,542
Now they're using 'em in East Timor.

131
00:12:28,713 --> 00:12:31,085
Same stuff that blew up
the senator's mansion.

132
00:12:31,465 --> 00:12:34,550
Whenever there's
a real high-class bomb for hire.

133
00:12:37,221 --> 00:12:38,086
Trust me.

134
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,553
Oh come on...

135
00:12:39,723 --> 00:12:40,921
Fuzzy, give me a break.

136
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:42,347
Come on, Ray.

137
00:12:42,643 --> 00:12:43,758
Listen man, listen.

138
00:12:43,936 --> 00:12:46,853
I'm your partner. Not only that,
I'm also your friend.

139
00:12:47,106 --> 00:12:48,564
I'm probably the only friend
you got left.

140
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:52,016
Now I can't sit back and watch you
throw your fuckin' life

141
00:12:52,194 --> 00:12:53,937
down the toilet, man.

142
00:12:54,154 --> 00:12:56,230
You gotta start talkin', man.
You know, let it out,

143
00:12:56,407 --> 00:12:58,150
get it outta your system
'fore it eats you alive.

144
00:12:58,784 --> 00:12:59,530
Thanks.

145
00:12:59,702 --> 00:13:01,326
- Straight ahead.
- Let's go, Vershbow.

146
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:02,443
Come on.

147
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:04,199
Turn left when you get
in there, love.

148
00:13:04,665 --> 00:13:07,120
Guess I could do with a drink,
I can tell ya that.

149
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:08,616
It's a little late for a delivery?

150
00:13:08,793 --> 00:13:10,419
Maybe they need somebody
to sign for it.

151
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:11,786
Let's sign for it.

152
00:13:52,921 --> 00:13:53,667
Police.

153
00:13:53,838 --> 00:13:55,037
What the fuck are you doin'?

154
00:13:55,214 --> 00:13:56,038
Police!

155
00:13:56,048 --> 00:13:57,164
- Police, god dammit.
- Let me go.

156
00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:58,041
Calm down!

157
00:13:59,176 --> 00:13:59,958
Watch out, Ray.

158
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:01,049
Look out!

159
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,899
Let's get outta here.

160
00:14:19,364 --> 00:14:20,146
Drop it.

161
00:14:21,282 --> 00:14:22,064
Let her go.

162
00:14:22,283 --> 00:14:23,149
Drop it.

163
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:32,157
You'll hit her.

164
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:42,796
Tell him to drop the gun, now
or I'll shoot the girl.

165
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,812
The end of your life has just begun.

166
00:14:54,815 --> 00:14:55,515
Let's go.

167
00:14:55,691 --> 00:14:56,936
Don't worry my dear.

168
00:14:57,359 --> 00:14:58,937
We'll be back for you.

169
00:15:05,534 --> 00:15:06,910
Okay Fuzzy,

170
00:15:07,785 --> 00:15:08,700
they're gone.

171
00:15:08,954 --> 00:15:09,820
Fuzzy?

172
00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:12,322
Hey man, it's gonna be all right.

173
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,747
Okay?

174
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:14,824
Damn,

175
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,706
you feel that draft?

176
00:15:17,837 --> 00:15:19,214
- What?
- It's cold.

177
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:20,912
Well just don't talk.

178
00:15:21,758 --> 00:15:22,540
Just don't talk.

179
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:24,466
Ray?

180
00:15:24,553 --> 00:15:25,300
Yeah?

181
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:29,178
Ray,

182
00:15:29,641 --> 00:15:31,016
those demons inside you...

183
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:37,849
let 'em go, Ray...

184
00:15:39,234 --> 00:15:40,812
'fore it's too late.

185
00:15:46,658 --> 00:15:48,117
Oh no man, come on.

186
00:15:48,535 --> 00:15:49,317
Oh no.

187
00:15:49,995 --> 00:15:51,275
Don't die on me.

188
00:15:51,455 --> 00:15:52,402
God dammit.

189
00:15:52,748 --> 00:15:54,621
Don't die on me, man, Fuzzy.

190
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:06,758
Prints?

191
00:16:06,928 --> 00:16:08,422
We're workin' on it.

192
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,545
What about Ballistics?

193
00:16:09,722 --> 00:16:11,798
The lab's backed up so
we're gonna have to wait a while.

194
00:16:14,895 --> 00:16:17,052
Hey Nettles,
Captain's lookin' for you.

195
00:16:17,313 --> 00:16:18,061
Thanks.

196
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:20,973
Nettles.

197
00:16:27,782 --> 00:16:29,525
I'm sorry, Fuzzy was a good cop.

198
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:32,327
He was a good man, too.

199
00:16:32,495 --> 00:16:34,617
- I want in on this, Captain.
- Wait a minute buddy boy.

200
00:16:34,956 --> 00:16:37,280
You're Narcotics.
This is a homicide case.

201
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,664
I saw the bastards, I know...
what they look like.

202
00:16:39,836 --> 00:16:41,495
You gotta let me in on it.
You know that.

203
00:16:41,671 --> 00:16:43,462
I understand, you know the rules.

204
00:16:43,631 --> 00:16:45,422
Until Internal Affairs
clears this up.

205
00:16:45,716 --> 00:16:48,172
She won't talk.
This is all she had on her.

206
00:16:48,594 --> 00:16:49,970
We don't even have a name.

207
00:16:51,598 --> 00:16:52,593
I got a name.

208
00:16:52,932 --> 00:16:54,724
In memory of Brandon.

209
00:16:54,975 --> 00:16:56,138
Somethin' to start with.

210
00:16:56,311 --> 00:16:58,599
- What is this?
- That's the bracelet she was wearing.

211
00:16:59,146 --> 00:17:00,688
Looks like detonation
wire or somethin'.

212
00:17:00,856 --> 00:17:02,897
Run that down
to the bomb squad, Artie.

213
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,444
Let me do it.

214
00:17:06,695 --> 00:17:07,858
On come on, let me do it.

215
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,027
Artie.

216
00:17:11,575 --> 00:17:12,607
Captain,

217
00:17:12,827 --> 00:17:14,107
let me do it.

218
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,531
Okay Ray.

219
00:17:15,913 --> 00:17:16,743
You go home.

220
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,115
You get cleaned up,
you get some rest.

221
00:17:21,961 --> 00:17:22,873
Thanks.

222
00:17:24,212 --> 00:17:25,209
What an asshole.

223
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:30,136
And then my tongue
stud gets caught...

224
00:17:30,302 --> 00:17:32,875
on- on- on his um, his earrings.

225
00:17:34,806 --> 00:17:38,140
So, there we were,
making out at the concert, right,

226
00:17:38,518 --> 00:17:40,393
things were really getting hot.

227
00:17:40,979 --> 00:17:43,851
Okay, right. So
we're-we're making out, right?

228
00:17:44,774 --> 00:17:46,233
What took you so long?

229
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:47,148
Excuse me?

230
00:17:47,402 --> 00:17:49,976
Medium everything,
hold the anchovies.

231
00:17:50,155 --> 00:17:51,353
You're the pizza guy, right?

232
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,282
I'm looking for the bomb squad.

233
00:17:53,992 --> 00:17:55,534
I'm sorry- sorry.

234
00:17:55,702 --> 00:17:58,026
L- I just... I assumed that...

235
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,907
Bomb squad where?

236
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,321
Out on a call.

237
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,000
Third and hyde.

238
00:18:03,168 --> 00:18:03,998
Thank you.

239
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:08,328
Sorry, Mom.

240
00:18:13,553 --> 00:18:15,511
Here it comes, all right?

241
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,426
Feel it?

242
00:18:17,391 --> 00:18:18,884
Tick tock.

243
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,975
Tick tock.

244
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:26,348
I felt it.

245
00:18:26,524 --> 00:18:29,276
That, Dugger, is the very
essence of our existence.

246
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,525
Synchronicity.

247
00:18:31,322 --> 00:18:32,696
Synchronicity.

248
00:18:32,864 --> 00:18:34,607
Swan, they're holding her downtown.

249
00:18:35,283 --> 00:18:36,446
And what if she talks?

250
00:18:36,618 --> 00:18:37,697
She won't talk.

251
00:18:37,952 --> 00:18:38,984
You trust me on that.

252
00:18:39,162 --> 00:18:41,568
Well that's real reassuring,
Swan, but just in case,

253
00:18:41,748 --> 00:18:43,123
I think I'll cut out now...

254
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,531
and disappear.

255
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,918
And what would Michelangelo say?

256
00:18:47,212 --> 00:18:49,619
You think he'd let one
of his trusted pigment mixers

257
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:52,122
just abandon him in the middle
of painting the Sistine Chapel?

258
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,542
What the hell are you talking about?

259
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,922
We're about to create
a work of art here, a masterpiece,

260
00:18:58,097 --> 00:19:00,671
a masterpiece that's gonna be
discussed and talked about a

261
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,261
And admired for centuries.

262
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:06,219
And until that last,
magnificent brush stroke is finished,

263
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:09,603
nothin', absolutely nothin',

264
00:19:09,984 --> 00:19:11,693
is gonna get in the way

265
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:14,310
of the artistic process.
Is that clear?

266
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:18,774
Crystal.

267
00:19:19,118 --> 00:19:20,446
Are we clear on that?

268
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,872
And our business plans
will not change.

269
00:19:24,707 --> 00:19:26,948
And we'll continue our preparations

270
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:28,918
with or without

271
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,290
our lovely muse.

272
00:19:32,006 --> 00:19:33,714
Well we can't just leave her behind.

273
00:19:33,883 --> 00:19:35,591
There's no way the
cop's will let her out.

274
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,165
Unless we force 'em.

275
00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:39,171
How the hell are we gonna do that?

276
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,850
Through pure and simple motivation.

277
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:44,424
Is that right?

278
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,810
And I'm motivated.

279
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,602
We got a ticker in the shoebox.

280
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:30,597
- I better call Meg.
- Ball and chain.

281
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:32,681
Look, ten bucks says that
he's asking himself right now...

282
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,352
- Excuse me.
- What the hell?

283
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,443
- Who's in charge?
- He is.

284
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,779
Maybe you can tell me what that is.

285
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:42,857
It's cute.

286
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,535
Swap, Meet jewelry.

287
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,161
Where'd you get this, brother?

288
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:47,989
Off a girl's wrist.

289
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,653
She still alive?

290
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,241
Yeah.

291
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:52,415
Why?

292
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,084
Because this is real dangerous shit,

293
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,496
and that means she's probably
a dangerous young lady.

294
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,509
See that outer strand? That's
some kind of high-grade det cord.

295
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:03,470
- And the inner strand...
- Well yeah the inner strand,

296
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:04,504
is Semtex.

297
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:05,718
Excuse me?

298
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:06,881
Semtex is a...

299
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,383
kind of a rich man's C-four.

300
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,392
Same stuff they used to blow
up that jet in Lockerbie,

301
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,805
same stuff they used in...
the embassy in Nairobi,

302
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,429
Dar Es Salaam.

303
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,152
I think you get the picture, y'all.

304
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,143
Yeah.

305
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:22,486
That right there is usually harmless
and easy to manage by itself.

306
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:23,985
But you combine that
with a detonator...

307
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,617
Yeah, so anyway uh...

308
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,572
if this is her idea of fancy jewelry,

309
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,823
you can bet she's into
some nasty shit, brother.

310
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,240
Thanks.

311
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,466
All right let's go fishin'.

312
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,014
Okay now Pooch,

313
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,642
ease off
the top just real slowly.

314
00:21:55,021 --> 00:21:56,433
Easin' and pleasin', boss.

315
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,815
Getting' that warm, tingly feelin'.

316
00:21:58,984 --> 00:21:59,933
Slowly.

317
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:00,982
Slow.

318
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,984
TJ, get on in there
and just tell me what you see.

319
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,026
- Jump in there TJ.
- Shit.

320
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,741
Shit.

321
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,241
Oh come on wimpy, grab it.

322
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,661
Keep talkin' to me.

323
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,119
Come on Teej. One size fits all.

324
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,376
Looks like we got ourselves
a hot little number here.

325
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,927
What the hell is that?

326
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,181
All right.

327
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,398
Yeah, I told ya
there wasn't nothin' there.

328
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,685
A hula girl?

329
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:48,855
It kinda looks like Barbie
with a little ass on it, don't it?

330
00:22:51,202 --> 00:22:52,696
This is whacked.

331
00:22:53,496 --> 00:22:56,746
We came here to do a money job,
not to risk our lives saving the girl.

332
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,293
Gentle, my good man.

333
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,745
She's been an accident
waiting to happen,

334
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:05,628
- ever since you hooked up with her.
- And if it was you in there Vershbow,

335
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,922
I wonder if you'd be havin'
the same feelings.

336
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,967
Oh yeah, like you'd put it
on the line for me.

337
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,307
To keep you in good health
and quiet, I'd do the same for you.

338
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,265
You mix, I paint.

339
00:23:19,438 --> 00:23:21,230
You've been a good student, Dugger.

340
00:23:21,524 --> 00:23:23,766
Maybe next time I'll
let ya sign the canvas.

341
00:23:35,663 --> 00:23:36,528
Here, Captain.

342
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,117
Did we get a hit on the girl's prints?

343
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:41,415
Not yet, and you know what?
That's none of your concern.

344
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,670
Captain, line 1. He says it's important,
says it's something about the girl.

345
00:23:46,923 --> 00:23:47,754
Winters here.

346
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:50,001
- Go get Glass on a conference call.
- Yes sir.

347
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,141
What?

348
00:23:51,262 --> 00:23:53,587
I said if you don't release her...

349
00:23:53,973 --> 00:23:55,681
you'll have a lot of dead people

350
00:23:55,849 --> 00:23:58,092
with missing body parts
on your conscience.

351
00:23:58,561 --> 00:24:00,139
It's four o'clock now.

352
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,103
And if she doesn't walk by five...

353
00:24:04,566 --> 00:24:05,811
let's just say uh...

354
00:24:06,235 --> 00:24:08,608
you'll have a very bloody happy hour.

355
00:24:08,863 --> 00:24:10,273
We need more time.

356
00:24:10,781 --> 00:24:12,109
Your time's up.

357
00:24:26,588 --> 00:24:28,876
Phone company said it was scrambled.

358
00:24:30,426 --> 00:24:32,169
- What the hell did he mean by that?
- A bomb.

359
00:24:32,469 --> 00:24:33,335
A bomb?

360
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:36,128
Her bracelet is made out
of detonation cord.

361
00:24:38,057 --> 00:24:39,007
They're pros.

362
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:42,180
They're a bunch of chumps,
playing a bluff card.

363
00:24:42,353 --> 00:24:44,264
Bomb squad found traces
of Semtex on the bracelet.

364
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:45,185
Semtex?

365
00:24:45,357 --> 00:24:46,353
Nasty stuff.

366
00:24:46,524 --> 00:24:48,149
Ring down to the bomb squad.
I want 'em on alert.

367
00:24:48,318 --> 00:24:49,314
- Right.
- I'll do it.

368
00:24:49,486 --> 00:24:51,858
We're a team here, Nettles.
You stay on the bench.

369
00:24:52,363 --> 00:24:53,608
- Why?
- Just do it!

370
00:24:55,992 --> 00:24:57,107
Jackass.

371
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,330
Man I love the Internet.

372
00:25:00,497 --> 00:25:02,323
You should see the recipes
for death and disaster...

373
00:25:02,499 --> 00:25:03,613
- on this thing.
- Hey Joey, it's Daddy.

374
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:06,704
Fourteen different ways to
blow up, kill, maim.

375
00:25:06,878 --> 00:25:08,622
With whichever kind of
bomb you would like.

376
00:25:08,797 --> 00:25:11,039
- Thank you America.
- Did you help Mommy like I told you to?

377
00:25:11,216 --> 00:25:12,924
For the Freedom of Information Act.

378
00:25:15,344 --> 00:25:18,299
Buy me dinner or I'll bring you up
on harassment charges.

379
00:25:18,515 --> 00:25:19,345
Baldie.

380
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:22,467
Hey that's the guy
I was tellin' you about.

381
00:25:22,894 --> 00:25:24,767
Yeah we just got
a bomb threat upstairs.

382
00:25:27,607 --> 00:25:30,358
My my partner was killed last night,
the dirtbag who did it is the bomber.

383
00:25:30,526 --> 00:25:31,558
Now what do we do?

384
00:25:33,613 --> 00:25:35,522
Well we are not gonna do anything.

385
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:37,987
You are gonna get together
with your detectives

386
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,694
and do some detective work
and see if you can find the bombers,

387
00:25:41,871 --> 00:25:44,161
or the bomb, so we can do our job.

388
00:25:44,332 --> 00:25:47,202
And let's just hope it is a crank'
cause maybe nothin' we can do.

389
00:25:48,586 --> 00:25:50,625
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means...

390
00:25:50,796 --> 00:25:54,166
- we deactivate explosive devices.
- You're the bomb squad.

391
00:25:54,383 --> 00:25:57,005
Right, isn't your job to
stop these things?

392
00:25:57,302 --> 00:25:58,963
We need detectives up there...

393
00:25:59,137 --> 00:26:00,549
so that we can do our job.

394
00:26:00,722 --> 00:26:01,802
You're right.

395
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,841
Let's just sit on our hands
and wait for innocent people to die.

396
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:06,216
What the hell was I thinking?

397
00:26:06,396 --> 00:26:09,313
What you should be thinking is,
get up there and do some...

398
00:26:09,482 --> 00:26:11,060
detective work.

399
00:26:13,402 --> 00:26:14,351
Bye.

400
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:39,052
Well, hello beautiful.

401
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,501
May I buy you a drink?

402
00:26:42,806 --> 00:26:43,506
Sure.

403
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:45,130
What would you like?

404
00:26:45,808 --> 00:26:46,675
Shot of Tequila.

405
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,395
A shot of Tequila?

406
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,221
Barkeep,

407
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,942
a shot of Tequila for the lady.

408
00:26:55,194 --> 00:26:57,270
- And I'll have a Coca-cola.
- Yes sir.

409
00:26:57,571 --> 00:26:58,484
I'm workin'.

410
00:26:59,989 --> 00:27:01,069
I'm workin' you.

411
00:27:05,078 --> 00:27:06,869
Nettles, I've got that info for you.

412
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,873
A bar called Happy Hour in the
Warehouse District at Beach Street.

413
00:27:11,001 --> 00:27:12,993
Yeah, I know that dive, thanks.

414
00:27:14,546 --> 00:27:16,123
What's your position?

415
00:27:16,339 --> 00:27:17,584
I'm in Chinatown.

416
00:27:17,757 --> 00:27:19,501
I should be there in two minutes.

417
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:23,851
So,

418
00:27:24,473 --> 00:27:26,679
- told you a little about myself.
- You did?

419
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:27,813
Yeah.

420
00:27:29,143 --> 00:27:30,174
It's your turn.

421
00:27:33,398 --> 00:27:34,857
What would you like to know?

422
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:39,144
Well I'd like to know how to get
to know you a little better.

423
00:27:40,905 --> 00:27:42,067
To get to know me.

424
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,238
I'll tell you this.

425
00:27:48,246 --> 00:27:50,915
The whole world's gonna know
who I am, baby.

426
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:25,155
It's music to my heart.

427
00:28:27,035 --> 00:28:29,026
You da bomb, baby.

428
00:28:30,078 --> 00:28:30,861
What?

429
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,164
Ding-dong, the bitch is dead,
the bitch is dead.

430
00:28:34,792 --> 00:28:35,538
Ciao.

431
00:29:03,654 --> 00:29:05,279
Police. Get down, get down!

432
00:29:50,866 --> 00:29:52,444
Pooch, give me something.

433
00:29:52,952 --> 00:29:54,530
Not much to go on.

434
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:57,914
Whoever this guy was knew
what he was doing, that's for sure.

435
00:29:58,083 --> 00:29:59,328
Let me sample this.

436
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:01,366
Watch your back.

437
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:12,673
Watch your step, sir.

438
00:30:18,978 --> 00:30:20,093
Please,

439
00:30:20,313 --> 00:30:22,886
my husband and daughter
are in that building.

440
00:30:23,066 --> 00:30:24,892
- M'am, no, no.
- Please.

441
00:30:25,068 --> 00:30:26,610
I'm sorry, we can't let
you through here.

442
00:30:26,778 --> 00:30:28,816
They're my whole life!

443
00:30:29,823 --> 00:30:30,652
Please m'am.

444
00:30:30,824 --> 00:30:31,570
Please.

445
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,487
Please.

446
00:30:36,245 --> 00:30:39,827
You know, every time you show your
face, there's some fuckin' disaster.

447
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:40,994
Why is that?

448
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:44,875
At least I was trying
to do something.

449
00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:45,959
Oh yeah?

450
00:30:46,005 --> 00:30:48,792
You know, I keep tellin' you,
you don't belong here.

451
00:30:48,967 --> 00:30:50,081
Why you still here?

452
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,967
You touch me again,
Pluchinsky, and uh...

453
00:30:52,136 --> 00:30:53,796
Wh- and what?

454
00:30:53,971 --> 00:30:55,134
You gonna shoot me?

455
00:30:55,556 --> 00:30:57,513
No I'm not your fuckin'
partner, all right?

456
00:30:57,683 --> 00:30:58,881
I will make retirement.

457
00:31:00,144 --> 00:31:01,424
Falta subtitulo.

458
00:31:02,563 --> 00:31:03,891
What-what, motherfucker!

459
00:31:04,064 --> 00:31:05,227
Let go of me.

460
00:31:05,691 --> 00:31:07,850
You son of a bitch,
don't you touch me fuckin' again.

461
00:31:10,112 --> 00:31:11,523
- Fuck you.
- Get outta here.

462
00:31:11,947 --> 00:31:13,857
Get outta here before I kick your ass.

463
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:17,358
Oh Artie, Artie, listen to me,
listen to me.

464
00:31:18,537 --> 00:31:20,328
I've been talkin' to Nettles
a little bit, you know.

465
00:31:20,497 --> 00:31:22,039
I kinda feel like he's got
some intel that's...

466
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:23,487
real vital to our group.

467
00:31:23,917 --> 00:31:25,993
You don't mind if I sneak him
on in with us, do you?

468
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,165
He's all yours.

469
00:31:27,337 --> 00:31:29,046
Thank you man, I appreciate that.

470
00:31:29,464 --> 00:31:31,124
Right guys,
we appreciate it, don't we?

471
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:32,544
Oh I love it.

472
00:31:32,717 --> 00:31:33,798
Why the save?

473
00:31:33,969 --> 00:31:36,127
I'm tryin' to save you
from yourself, man.

474
00:31:36,304 --> 00:31:37,847
What's that supposed to mean?

475
00:31:38,015 --> 00:31:40,054
You gotta get beyond hope and fear.

476
00:31:41,018 --> 00:31:42,809
Learn the nature of your own mind.

477
00:31:43,186 --> 00:31:44,100
And then,

478
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:46,396
you won't be suffering anymore.

479
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:48,187
You comin'?

480
00:31:56,074 --> 00:31:59,159
Traces of Semtex just like the braid
on that det cord bracelet.

481
00:32:00,077 --> 00:32:01,537
Check out the sequencing.

482
00:32:03,123 --> 00:32:05,495
I've never seen anything
so beautifully choreographed.

483
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:10,420
Yeah the detonator's made
out of Semtex, that's for sure.

484
00:32:11,172 --> 00:32:12,750
So what kind of bomb was it?

485
00:32:13,007 --> 00:32:14,288
Did you say the B word?

486
00:32:14,634 --> 00:32:15,416
Excuse me?

487
00:32:15,843 --> 00:32:17,836
Nettles you gotta be more Zen.

488
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:20,172
- Device.
- Don't use the B word.

489
00:32:20,348 --> 00:32:21,379
Device.

490
00:32:21,683 --> 00:32:22,678
B is for boom.

491
00:32:25,061 --> 00:32:27,267
So you're the Device Squad
and you defuse...

492
00:32:27,438 --> 00:32:28,185
devices.

493
00:32:28,356 --> 00:32:30,264
We treat devices.

494
00:32:30,942 --> 00:32:32,104
Anything else I should know?

495
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,775
Yeah.

496
00:32:33,903 --> 00:32:34,935
Watch where you step.

497
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:40,408
Check it out boss, we got action.

498
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,320
Stay close to us.

499
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:45,952
What ya think?

500
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:48,497
Computer chip.

501
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:52,622
That could be from an IRD.

502
00:32:53,006 --> 00:32:55,294
Very, very nasty piece of shit.

503
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:57,882
Let's hope that's not what this is.

504
00:33:06,977 --> 00:33:08,935
Hey remember, I'm watchin' your ass.

505
00:33:09,647 --> 00:33:12,185
You know Pluchinsky, pretty words
and a smile just aren't gonna

506
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:13,604
get me to kiss you.

507
00:33:14,652 --> 00:33:16,442
Captain, we got a hit on the prints.

508
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:18,772
I was wondering why it took so long.

509
00:33:18,948 --> 00:33:20,904
Turns out she had
high-security clearance.

510
00:33:21,075 --> 00:33:23,744
- Department of Defense contractor.
- Claire Manning, twenty-nine,

511
00:33:23,911 --> 00:33:26,485
San Francisco.
Married to a Brandon Manning,

512
00:33:26,663 --> 00:33:29,499
- an architect, died last May.
- In memory of Brandon.

513
00:33:29,917 --> 00:33:32,205
She was an Rand D Skunkworks
nuclear specialist.

514
00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:34,578
Trained at Lawrence
Livermore and Langley.

515
00:33:34,755 --> 00:33:37,329
- Resigned abruptly last year.
- Sir, it's him.

516
00:33:40,762 --> 00:33:41,675
Yeah.

517
00:33:42,012 --> 00:33:43,637
How will you tell them, Captain?

518
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:48,299
How will you explain to the families

519
00:33:48,518 --> 00:33:50,807
that their loved ones
didn't have to die?

520
00:33:51,647 --> 00:33:52,726
You got a name?

521
00:33:53,023 --> 00:33:54,268
No, this time,

522
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,848
I'll give you two hours.

523
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,735
But if she isn't released by then...

524
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:01,360
another bomb will go off,
and then another and another until...

525
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:02,688
every man...

526
00:34:03,366 --> 00:34:05,987
woman and child in this city...

527
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:07,908
is either dead...

528
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,405
- or in mourning.
- Talk to me, please.

529
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,070
Tick tock.

530
00:34:12,251 --> 00:34:13,074
Tick...

531
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:14,081
tock.

532
00:34:19,966 --> 00:34:20,748
Find him.

533
00:34:24,013 --> 00:34:25,174
Hey Angie um,

534
00:34:26,848 --> 00:34:29,635
I wanna check on
Brandon Manning's work history.

535
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:32,976
I want a list of every project
he's ever been involved with,

536
00:34:33,146 --> 00:34:35,222
and uh, call the Feds,
see if they'll give us

537
00:34:35,398 --> 00:34:37,438
any details on the girl
without a court order, ok?

538
00:35:14,438 --> 00:35:15,895
Officer Gordon, hi.

539
00:35:18,858 --> 00:35:20,020
She's tough, huh?

540
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:21,148
Tough?

541
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,109
Tough is, where's my lawyer.

542
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:27,111
Well the Captain wants me
to take a crack at her.

543
00:35:27,283 --> 00:35:28,106
Fine.

544
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,401
- You baby-sit her for awhile.
- Okay.

545
00:35:38,084 --> 00:35:39,544
You remember me?

546
00:35:40,296 --> 00:35:41,624
Yeah, I remember you.

547
00:35:42,131 --> 00:35:44,801
Sorry about the eye.
You didn't give me much choice.

548
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,839
First my partner,
then all the others.

549
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,766
What makes you so valuable that uh,

550
00:35:53,934 --> 00:35:56,259
they'd slaughter all these innocent
people just to get you back?

551
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:01,481
Look, I know you don't wanna talk.

552
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:04,319
Somebody once told me
that that's the only way you can uh,

553
00:36:04,611 --> 00:36:07,281
you know, get better, feel better.

554
00:36:08,407 --> 00:36:09,237
You see uh...

555
00:36:19,042 --> 00:36:21,035
you see not too long ago um,

556
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:31,340
not long ago I...

557
00:36:33,431 --> 00:36:35,757
I lost two people
I loved very much...

558
00:36:36,268 --> 00:36:37,092
too.

559
00:37:04,378 --> 00:37:05,624
Your husband uh,

560
00:37:06,381 --> 00:37:07,874
was a gifted architect...

561
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,466
Brandon Manning.

562
00:37:10,635 --> 00:37:13,720
Famous, was about to expose
a massive cover-up,

563
00:37:13,888 --> 00:37:16,842
they were gonna build
a elementary school on a toxic

564
00:37:17,016 --> 00:37:19,139
waste site downtown.

565
00:37:19,852 --> 00:37:22,426
But before he could blow the
whistle he dies in a car accident.

566
00:37:22,647 --> 00:37:23,845
It was not an accident.

567
00:37:24,732 --> 00:37:26,440
That's what the grand jury
said it was.

568
00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:29,361
He was murdered in cold blood
because of his integrity.

569
00:37:29,904 --> 00:37:31,184
And nobody gave a damn.

570
00:37:32,031 --> 00:37:34,272
So that's why you're
with these terrorists?

571
00:37:34,492 --> 00:37:36,615
That's why you're
with these terrorists?

572
00:37:41,541 --> 00:37:43,948
First my partner, then the bar.

573
00:37:44,669 --> 00:37:46,745
Now, who is he?

574
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,248
Tell me his name.

575
00:37:48,505 --> 00:37:51,756
Why is he killing all these
innocent people for you?

576
00:37:55,596 --> 00:37:57,838
Why's he want you back
so bad he killed all these people?

577
00:37:58,015 --> 00:37:59,295
Now tell me his name.

578
00:38:00,809 --> 00:38:01,805
Who is he?

579
00:38:02,186 --> 00:38:02,932
Tell me.

580
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,441
God dammit, tell me his name!
What's his name!

581
00:38:10,277 --> 00:38:12,270
What is his goddamn name!

582
00:38:12,446 --> 00:38:15,649
Hey listen the police aren't gonna
let you go and l- you- you know that.

583
00:38:15,824 --> 00:38:18,494
When your boyfriend realizes this,
a whole bunch of innocent people

584
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,902
are gonna die, kids and families,
for no good reason.

585
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,740
Now there's blood on your hands.

586
00:38:23,165 --> 00:38:23,947
Okay?

587
00:38:24,208 --> 00:38:25,032
Now...

588
00:38:25,084 --> 00:38:26,708
help me put an end to this.

589
00:38:26,877 --> 00:38:28,335
You're the only one who can.

590
00:38:34,051 --> 00:38:36,091
We met at a convention in Europe.

591
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,885
I was lonely, as you might imagine.

592
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:42,882
He was...

593
00:38:43,477 --> 00:38:44,259
brilliant,

594
00:38:44,686 --> 00:38:45,516
charming,

595
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:48,895
a fellow scientist, so he claimed.

596
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,018
By the time I learned the truth,

597
00:38:53,611 --> 00:38:55,319
I was too scared.

598
00:38:56,823 --> 00:38:58,816
I was too scared.

599
00:38:59,993 --> 00:39:01,107
Too scared for what?

600
00:39:02,245 --> 00:39:03,621
Too scared for what?

601
00:39:04,664 --> 00:39:05,613
Oh come on.

602
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:06,990
Tell me.

603
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:08,289
I can't.

604
00:39:08,627 --> 00:39:10,999
- Bullshit.
- You don't understand. I can't.

605
00:39:12,297 --> 00:39:15,381
If you want it stopped,
you have to let me go.

606
00:39:15,549 --> 00:39:16,331
Let you go?

607
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,135
You gotta get me out of here.

608
00:39:19,137 --> 00:39:20,844
You gotta get me outta here, okay?

609
00:39:23,182 --> 00:39:24,510
Take your hands off me.

610
00:39:24,767 --> 00:39:26,594
Don't touch me, don't touch me.

611
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,727
Take your hands off me.

612
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:30,722
Drop dead.

613
00:39:39,824 --> 00:39:40,855
Hey Nettles.

614
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,278
How'd it go with the girl?

615
00:39:42,452 --> 00:39:43,282
Not good.

616
00:39:44,328 --> 00:39:45,194
Hey Nettles...

617
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,739
what do you think
it would take to kind of

618
00:39:47,915 --> 00:39:49,244
give me all this from the beginning?

619
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:04,429
So what made you think
they were here?

620
00:40:05,098 --> 00:40:06,261
Hey, you're the expert.

621
00:40:06,433 --> 00:40:08,759
Looks like a really good
place to hide explisives.

622
00:40:09,603 --> 00:40:10,553
Discreet,

623
00:40:11,146 --> 00:40:12,475
quiet, out of the way.

624
00:40:12,856 --> 00:40:14,896
We might even find an IRD here.

625
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:17,352
You mentioned you saw
one of them once.

626
00:40:17,528 --> 00:40:19,771
- Where?
- Across the pond.

627
00:40:20,406 --> 00:40:23,110
I was uh, headin' a team, E-O-D.

628
00:40:24,827 --> 00:40:26,369
Some shit went sideways.

629
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:31,576
Lost some of my boys.

630
00:40:34,086 --> 00:40:36,494
But uh, I made a choice to live.

631
00:40:38,132 --> 00:40:40,254
So I light candles
for my boys that didn't.

632
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,465
So you live it too.

633
00:40:45,805 --> 00:40:47,134
If you call it livin'.

634
00:40:50,436 --> 00:40:52,310
You know I never cried when...

635
00:40:55,106 --> 00:40:56,187
I don't know.

636
00:40:57,108 --> 00:40:58,307
Maybe it's the guilt.

637
00:40:59,945 --> 00:41:01,569
After the funeral
I never went back...

638
00:41:03,281 --> 00:41:04,230
you know,

639
00:41:04,908 --> 00:41:06,106
to where they're buried.

640
00:41:06,368 --> 00:41:07,150
Yeah.

641
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,864
I'm afraid if I do,

642
00:41:10,997 --> 00:41:12,408
I'll blow my brains out.

643
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,869
It's just- it's just way too much.

644
00:41:19,214 --> 00:41:21,088
Well you know one thing
about hittin' the bottom.

645
00:41:22,216 --> 00:41:23,498
After that,

646
00:41:24,635 --> 00:41:26,260
there's only one way you can go.

647
00:41:26,888 --> 00:41:27,635
And that's up.

648
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,341
Yeah.

649
00:41:30,517 --> 00:41:31,927
That's enough talkin' for now.

650
00:41:32,436 --> 00:41:34,308
Time's up on our first session.

651
00:41:34,771 --> 00:41:36,052
It's right over here.

652
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:38,060
Yeah, um...

653
00:41:39,275 --> 00:41:40,935
girl was here with me.

654
00:41:41,862 --> 00:41:44,269
Guy in charge over there
with one of his men.

655
00:41:45,032 --> 00:41:46,359
Another guy was over there.

656
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:48,066
So...

657
00:41:48,284 --> 00:41:50,526
these bombers,
what's the typical profile?

658
00:41:51,371 --> 00:41:53,695
If you were a dog trainer
you'd call 'em fear biters.

659
00:41:53,873 --> 00:41:55,616
They wanna bite before they get bit.

660
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:57,497
People who uh,

661
00:41:57,961 --> 00:41:58,820
feel like...

662
00:41:59,211 --> 00:42:00,587
they'll blow something up

663
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,747
to kill somebody or make a statement,
but always from a long way away.

664
00:42:05,885 --> 00:42:07,048
Long distance.

665
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:10,006
Never wanna get up-close and personal.
Not that kind of people.

666
00:42:10,264 --> 00:42:12,222
Except if you don't play along,
these guys will blow you up.

667
00:42:13,642 --> 00:42:14,757
Most of 'em.

668
00:42:15,811 --> 00:42:18,219
You know uh, it's a power trip.

669
00:42:18,647 --> 00:42:19,513
But uh,

670
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,649
some of 'em don't follow through.

671
00:42:21,817 --> 00:42:24,605
- And the other one percent?
- Those are the dangerous ones.

672
00:42:24,945 --> 00:42:28,480
Criminal minds that are geniuses,
smarter than most law enforcement,

673
00:42:28,657 --> 00:42:30,982
most anti-terrorists, most military,

674
00:42:31,493 --> 00:42:33,819
they've got access to the most
sophisticated,

675
00:42:33,996 --> 00:42:35,823
deadly devices in the world.

676
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,164
Those are the ones
we gotta worry about.

677
00:42:38,876 --> 00:42:40,121
That's why we're here.

678
00:42:44,423 --> 00:42:45,418
Hm, what do we got here?

679
00:42:48,135 --> 00:42:49,214
Galois.

680
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:51,214
Eurotrash.

681
00:42:56,977 --> 00:42:59,469
Jazz Cat. Do you like the blues?

682
00:43:37,934 --> 00:43:39,393
Scotch on the rocks, please.

683
00:44:00,206 --> 00:44:01,202
Couple drinks?

684
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:03,709
No thanks. Hey...

685
00:44:04,002 --> 00:44:05,745
you know anybody who smokes
these French cigarettes?

686
00:44:07,171 --> 00:44:09,294
Galois cigarettes, Inspector.

687
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,050
There's a guy in the club
who smokes these Frenchies.

688
00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:14,464
Is he here tonight?

689
00:44:14,636 --> 00:44:15,835
Yeah. He's right over there.

690
00:44:16,222 --> 00:44:17,882
Thanks, are you new here?

691
00:44:18,307 --> 00:44:19,552
Let's go talk to him.

692
00:44:20,893 --> 00:44:21,807
What d'ya say?

693
00:44:22,604 --> 00:44:23,428
Police!

694
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,517
Show me your hands!

695
00:44:24,981 --> 00:44:26,808
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands.

696
00:44:27,024 --> 00:44:28,732
- Show me your hands!
- I didn't do nothin'.

697
00:44:28,902 --> 00:44:30,016
Show me your hands!

698
00:44:30,194 --> 00:44:31,606
- Put the gun down, brother.
- Show me!

699
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,574
Don't move, don't move.

700
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:41,576
Let the girl go.

701
00:44:42,498 --> 00:44:43,494
Come on, let's go.

702
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:45,157
I'll shoot you.

703
00:44:45,334 --> 00:44:46,793
- Let her go.
- No I won't!

704
00:44:48,003 --> 00:44:49,581
- Let the girl go.
- Let me go, please.

705
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:51,670
Do you think I'm crazy?

706
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,871
- Let the girl go.
- Fuck you!

707
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:53,880
I'll shoot you.

708
00:44:54,175 --> 00:44:55,587
- Go right ahead.
- Shoot.

709
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,883
- San Francisco is gonna blow.
- Let her go!

710
00:44:59,431 --> 00:45:00,290
Go 'head.

711
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,622
You know I could've used him alive.

712
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:28,374
Gotta learn to listen to me.

713
00:45:28,543 --> 00:45:30,501
But that was good shootin'.
That was a good shot.

714
00:45:43,808 --> 00:45:45,801
So uh, should I get ready to die?

715
00:45:46,353 --> 00:45:49,104
No, you know what?
This is not very sophisticated at all.

716
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:51,515
See?

717
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,231
I'm glad you were here.

718
00:45:58,531 --> 00:45:59,812
That's your new lucky number.

719
00:46:00,283 --> 00:46:02,774
You've heard of the twelve stages
of enlightenment, haven't you?

720
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:04,654
No, just one day at a time,
twelve steps.

721
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:05,992
Oh yeah.

722
00:46:06,832 --> 00:46:09,500
Well we haven't made
it through this day yet, have we?

723
00:46:10,668 --> 00:46:12,246
We're doin' good, so far.

724
00:46:15,048 --> 00:46:17,373
The bomb didn't go off
but Duggers died.

725
00:46:17,884 --> 00:46:19,710
Oh, you disappoint me.

726
00:46:24,431 --> 00:46:26,305
It's time to bring in the boys.

727
00:46:26,726 --> 00:46:27,722
Are they ready?

728
00:46:27,936 --> 00:46:30,260
Yes sir, ready and waitin'
for your signal.

729
00:46:35,442 --> 00:46:36,641
It's never stopped before.

730
00:46:36,819 --> 00:46:37,933
Well, let me see it.

731
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:41,855
Okay.

732
00:46:53,586 --> 00:46:55,578
Yeah, main spring's stuck.

733
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:56,960
All right...

734
00:46:57,798 --> 00:46:59,293
let me show ya a little somethin'.

735
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,341
I'm gonna teach you
the way I learned.

736
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:02,839
I'm gonna hand this back to you

737
00:47:03,012 --> 00:47:05,632
and give you the only tool you need
to fix this. It's real simple.

738
00:47:06,098 --> 00:47:08,387
Well, I'm an idiot when it comes
to mechanical things.

739
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:09,473
You're not an idiot, man.

740
00:47:09,644 --> 00:47:10,972
Just never tried it before.

741
00:47:11,144 --> 00:47:14,311
Take a look in there, you'll see right
away how to do this. It's very simple.

742
00:47:15,191 --> 00:47:18,607
Thing of it is, if I baby you,
tell you how to do it...

743
00:47:20,446 --> 00:47:21,987
in one ear and out the other.

744
00:47:22,155 --> 00:47:23,982
If I make you figure it out
you're gonna own it.

745
00:47:24,158 --> 00:47:25,023
Go for it.

746
00:47:36,169 --> 00:47:37,414
It's workin' again.

747
00:47:38,005 --> 00:47:38,835
Good job, man.

748
00:47:39,006 --> 00:47:40,120
Youjust made your first ticker.

749
00:47:49,057 --> 00:47:50,219
We need to talk, Nettles.

750
00:47:50,684 --> 00:47:51,507
Shit.

751
00:48:00,943 --> 00:48:02,736
I got a call from upstairs.

752
00:48:03,112 --> 00:48:05,235
They say you questioned the girl
yesterday. Is that true?

753
00:48:06,199 --> 00:48:07,029
Yeah, that's true.

754
00:48:07,201 --> 00:48:10,368
Claiming that I'd given you permission
in direct contradiction to my orders.

755
00:48:13,373 --> 00:48:14,232
Yes sir.

756
00:48:15,834 --> 00:48:18,455
Under any other circumstances
I'd have your ass canned.

757
00:48:20,588 --> 00:48:21,786
That said...

758
00:48:22,924 --> 00:48:24,204
she wants to talk to you again.

759
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:25,501
Alone.

760
00:48:35,937 --> 00:48:37,515
His name is Alex Swan.

761
00:48:38,981 --> 00:48:41,307
The one with the tattoos
and piercings goes by Dugger,

762
00:48:41,484 --> 00:48:43,311
and the other one
calls himself Vershbow.

763
00:48:43,527 --> 00:48:45,984
Dugger's dead.
So's the bomb he was carrying.

764
00:48:46,989 --> 00:48:50,109
Now, Swan's planning
a big hit now, isn't he?

765
00:48:50,868 --> 00:48:51,782
I don't know.

766
00:48:51,952 --> 00:48:54,705
Oh come on, tell me the target.
Tell me the true target.

767
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:57,575
This bombing was
a distraction, wasn't it?

768
00:48:58,542 --> 00:48:59,367
Wasn't it?

769
00:48:59,794 --> 00:49:02,249
Look, you said you wanted
to talk to me, now talk.

770
00:49:03,589 --> 00:49:04,371
Claire?

771
00:49:05,007 --> 00:49:07,759
Alex Swan is planning
a really big hit, isn't he?

772
00:49:07,927 --> 00:49:08,757
I don't know.

773
00:49:09,345 --> 00:49:10,258
Come on.

774
00:49:10,638 --> 00:49:11,587
Tell me the target.

775
00:49:15,017 --> 00:49:16,476
Tell me how to find him.

776
00:49:18,688 --> 00:49:21,060
Claire, come on, please.

777
00:49:21,566 --> 00:49:23,309
Tell me how to find him
before it's too late.

778
00:49:23,484 --> 00:49:25,440
All right, the last I knew,
they were...

779
00:49:26,278 --> 00:49:27,690
staying at a motel downtown,

780
00:49:27,863 --> 00:49:29,939
somewhere around the corner
from the warehouse.

781
00:49:30,116 --> 00:49:31,361
What was the name of it?

782
00:49:31,533 --> 00:49:34,025
The Sunburst uh,
room one thirty-eight.

783
00:49:34,202 --> 00:49:36,195
Sunburst, room one thirty-eight.

784
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:37,530
Yeah.

785
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:41,123
Thanks.

786
00:49:42,336 --> 00:49:44,044
He'll kill me for this.

787
00:49:44,421 --> 00:49:46,710
Even if you catch him,
he'll send someone else.

788
00:49:47,925 --> 00:49:49,716
It doesn't matter anymore anyway.

789
00:49:50,052 --> 00:49:51,594
I've lost too much already.

790
00:49:56,266 --> 00:49:57,464
You know what?

791
00:49:57,935 --> 00:49:59,133
There's always hope.

792
00:49:59,645 --> 00:50:02,646
You just took a small step
back towards life,

793
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,313
and ain't nobody gonna kill you.

794
00:50:25,336 --> 00:50:27,619
Cover all the entrances.

795
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:28,496
Stay alert.

796
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:29,616
Always, baby.

797
00:50:32,802 --> 00:50:33,632
Move.

798
00:50:48,652 --> 00:50:50,312
City, he can't even
save his own family.

799
00:50:50,529 --> 00:50:51,476
What did you say?

800
00:50:52,863 --> 00:50:54,027
You didn't hear me?

801
00:50:55,491 --> 00:50:57,152
- Come here, say it again.
- Oh sure.

802
00:50:57,661 --> 00:51:00,780
I said, how can you save the city if
you can't save your own fucking family.

803
00:51:05,501 --> 00:51:06,960
That's what I thought you said.

804
00:51:12,842 --> 00:51:14,834
Just coming up to an open door.

805
00:51:17,346 --> 00:51:19,006
After you, my good man.

806
00:51:21,809 --> 00:51:24,894
, get on in there
and just tell me what you see.

807
00:51:28,691 --> 00:51:29,556
They're gone.

808
00:51:31,109 --> 00:51:32,059
All right.

809
00:51:32,737 --> 00:51:34,445
Clear the building, bring the dog.

810
00:51:34,655 --> 00:51:36,482
We'll check the other rooms.

811
00:51:38,618 --> 00:51:39,779
Copy that.

812
00:51:39,953 --> 00:51:40,900
Sparky's on his way.

813
00:52:52,147 --> 00:52:54,769
You're the one, Thursday...

814
00:52:55,193 --> 00:52:57,101
three-sixteen in the AM.

815
00:52:57,279 --> 00:52:58,358
Thirty-seven cents.

816
00:52:58,572 --> 00:52:59,686
You were the short change.

817
00:52:59,865 --> 00:53:00,859
A little light.

818
00:53:01,032 --> 00:53:02,491
Where's your partner, officer?

819
00:53:03,368 --> 00:53:04,233
He's dead.

820
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:09,074
Now the guys who killed him, we
think they live in this neighborhood.

821
00:53:09,248 --> 00:53:11,324
You wouldn't know anything
about any bad people around here...

822
00:53:11,542 --> 00:53:13,451
- would ya?
- One has a beard.

823
00:53:13,628 --> 00:53:14,790
The other is tall...

824
00:53:14,962 --> 00:53:17,418
thin. Thin one wanted to offer me...

825
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:20,342
a donation, wanted to trade
for something I haven't used

826
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:21,672
for a long time.

827
00:53:25,348 --> 00:53:27,139
What kind of car did they drive?

828
00:53:27,308 --> 00:53:28,933
- Did they drive a car?
Originaly,

829
00:53:30,061 --> 00:53:33,726
plate M-L-A-l-5-8 Ford van.

830
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:37,439
But they switched late
Thursday night to a blue Taurus

831
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:41,062
with G-O-E-N-43 plates.

832
00:53:42,991 --> 00:53:44,533
G-O-E-N-43?

833
00:53:45,034 --> 00:53:46,196
That's what I said.

834
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:47,567
A steel trap.

835
00:53:48,537 --> 00:53:49,319
Okay.

836
00:53:51,498 --> 00:53:52,697
That's my life savings.

837
00:53:56,753 --> 00:53:57,500
G-O-E...

838
00:53:57,922 --> 00:53:59,036
N-43.

839
00:53:59,257 --> 00:54:00,169
Steel trap.

840
00:54:03,761 --> 00:54:05,919
Sir Lancelot is a good knight.

841
00:54:06,096 --> 00:54:09,430
He could save the,
no-no, he could save the kingdom.

842
00:54:12,728 --> 00:54:14,056
Afternoon gentlemen.

843
00:54:17,608 --> 00:54:19,814
Sure this is crazy,
you're gonna get us busted.

844
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:21,142
It has to be done.

845
00:54:21,445 --> 00:54:24,231
They've tested my patience
and my resolve long enough.

846
00:54:24,406 --> 00:54:26,896
Now if you're afraid, then go.

847
00:54:27,993 --> 00:54:29,156
I'll be in the car.

848
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:30,228
Fine.

849
00:54:31,871 --> 00:54:34,328
Excuse me officer.
Lawrence Bombeck, esquire.

850
00:54:34,499 --> 00:54:36,208
I represent Claire Manning.

851
00:54:36,376 --> 00:54:38,037
She wants her property
released to me,

852
00:54:38,211 --> 00:54:40,453
her credit cards actually,
to secure my retainer.

853
00:54:41,215 --> 00:54:42,044
Wait here.

854
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:44,048
I'll have to make a phone call.

855
00:54:46,721 --> 00:54:49,970
Angie, I have a man here claiming
to be Claire Manning's lawyer.

856
00:54:50,141 --> 00:54:51,254
Everything's fine.

857
00:54:53,101 --> 00:54:54,015
Captain...

858
00:54:54,311 --> 00:54:56,599
there's a man downstairs,
says he's Claire's lawyer.

859
00:54:57,814 --> 00:54:58,728
Put him on.

860
00:54:59,858 --> 00:55:00,681
Hello.

861
00:55:00,692 --> 00:55:01,392
Sir?

862
00:55:01,568 --> 00:55:04,937
Sure enough, the uh, plates belong
to a car rented Thursday night...

863
00:55:05,112 --> 00:55:05,860
downtown.

864
00:55:06,031 --> 00:55:07,442
Guy's name's Alex Swan.

865
00:55:07,699 --> 00:55:09,607
A-K-A, twenty other names.

866
00:55:09,785 --> 00:55:12,454
Guy's a legend
in the bomb-for-hire business.

867
00:55:16,165 --> 00:55:18,490
He's the cat who blew
the senator's mansion.

868
00:55:18,919 --> 00:55:22,086
The other one, Vershbow,
he's a freelance demolition expert.

869
00:55:22,381 --> 00:55:25,962
Just so happens he's worked for half the
governments in the Western hemisphere.

870
00:55:26,133 --> 00:55:27,960
Including ours
during the Reagan Administration.

871
00:55:28,137 --> 00:55:29,796
Let's get out an APB y'all.

872
00:55:30,096 --> 00:55:30,842
Right away.

873
00:55:40,857 --> 00:55:41,971
This wasn't the deal.

874
00:55:42,233 --> 00:55:45,068
You want her property that bad,
you wanna be close to your girl,

875
00:55:45,236 --> 00:55:46,860
well you couldn't get
any closer than this.

876
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:48,310
I'm not gonna end up like Dugger.

877
00:55:48,573 --> 00:55:50,031
Now get the hell out of here.

878
00:55:50,199 --> 00:55:51,023
Game over.

879
00:55:51,201 --> 00:55:53,870
I offered you a chance
to be part of history,

880
00:55:54,244 --> 00:55:56,487
and fame and fortune, you fool.

881
00:55:57,457 --> 00:55:59,081
Give me the briefcase.

882
00:56:04,881 --> 00:56:06,423
You're forgettin' some'in'.

883
00:56:07,132 --> 00:56:08,081
Detonator.

884
00:56:12,263 --> 00:56:14,967
You're makin'
a great mistake, Vershbow.

885
00:56:16,434 --> 00:56:17,548
Now beat it,

886
00:56:17,726 --> 00:56:19,351
Michael-fuckin'-angelo.

887
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:32,234
Nettles, suspect spotted in area.

888
00:56:32,408 --> 00:56:34,484
Repeat, suspect may be
in police parking lot, over.

889
00:56:35,077 --> 00:56:35,777
I need backup.

890
00:56:52,469 --> 00:56:54,545
- Let's go we got a perp!
- Stay down!

891
00:56:55,806 --> 00:56:57,928
Drop the weapon
and get outta the car.

892
00:56:58,225 --> 00:56:59,505
Put the bag down!

893
00:57:12,823 --> 00:57:15,574
Move your fuckin' car, chief.

894
00:57:19,288 --> 00:57:21,030
Move that fucking car...

895
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:22,820
or I'll blow it out of the way.

896
00:57:41,893 --> 00:57:42,972
Wait on command.

897
00:58:28,731 --> 00:58:29,762
Come on buddy,

898
00:58:30,483 --> 00:58:32,559
time to go to work
Let's go check out the tire.

899
00:58:32,735 --> 00:58:34,727
Get your sniffer up there.
Come on, come on.

900
00:58:34,904 --> 00:58:35,853
What you got.

901
00:58:37,364 --> 00:58:38,111
Nothing?

902
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:42,828
Come on, you're not gonna
get your raise like this.

903
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,235
Let's go around back.

904
00:58:44,412 --> 00:58:46,286
- Come on, come on.
- Engine clear.

905
00:58:47,416 --> 00:58:48,246
Sniff.

906
00:58:48,416 --> 00:58:49,247
Sniff.

907
00:58:49,417 --> 00:58:50,449
What you smelling?

908
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:51,744
Nuggets.

909
00:58:51,754 --> 00:58:53,081
- You smellin' nuggets.
- All right babe, once...

910
00:58:53,256 --> 00:58:55,746

913
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:02,924
You're smellin'TJ?

914
00:59:12,858 --> 00:59:14,103
Head and tail are clear.

915
00:59:21,867 --> 00:59:22,898
Reach out,

916
00:59:23,368 --> 00:59:25,657
reach out
and touch someone.

917
00:59:30,374 --> 00:59:31,205
Oh no.

918
00:59:43,304 --> 00:59:44,219
Pooch!

919
00:59:48,936 --> 00:59:50,643
Thank you and call again.

920
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:04,028
You got a minute?

921
01:00:06,077 --> 01:00:07,321
I just wanted to...

922
01:00:08,496 --> 01:00:10,370
ljust wanna say thank you.

923
01:00:10,582 --> 01:00:11,696
It's no big deal.

924
01:00:14,044 --> 01:00:14,874
That's uh...

925
01:00:16,545 --> 01:00:18,539
that's Pooch's wife and kid.

926
01:00:19,715 --> 01:00:20,746
I'll talk to 'em.

927
01:00:24,846 --> 01:00:25,628
It's him.

928
01:00:26,764 --> 01:00:28,092
Gotta get back to you.

929
01:00:28,849 --> 01:00:29,679
Quiet.

930
01:00:33,729 --> 01:00:34,476
Winters here.

931
01:00:35,314 --> 01:00:37,852
You people
just don't learn, do you?

932
01:00:38,192 --> 01:00:39,105
We're ready to talk.

933
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:42,184
Oh you mean stall, don't you,
so your little team...

934
01:00:42,363 --> 01:00:45,981
team of techno-geeks
can try and trace me?

935
01:00:46,658 --> 01:00:48,533
This is my final warning.

936
01:00:48,786 --> 01:00:52,487
The city has one hour to release
the girl exactly where you found her.

937
01:00:52,748 --> 01:00:53,993
Fifteen seconds.

938
01:00:54,166 --> 01:00:56,040
One hour, you understand?

939
01:00:58,379 --> 01:01:00,455
The girl in exchange for...

940
01:01:03,216 --> 01:01:04,841
let's just say,

941
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:07,466
there're not enough cemeteries...

942
01:01:07,637 --> 01:01:11,257
in the city or enough hospital
beds for the maimed.

943
01:01:11,433 --> 01:01:14,719
Well wait a second.
You know we can't just let her go.

944
01:01:14,937 --> 01:01:16,929
How do we know we can trust you?

945
01:01:17,105 --> 01:01:18,849
You can trust me.

946
01:01:20,485 --> 01:01:21,646
One hour.

947
01:01:24,988 --> 01:01:25,812
What?

948
01:01:26,281 --> 01:01:26,981
No.

949
01:01:42,715 --> 01:01:43,876
I want ya

950
01:01:44,049 --> 01:01:46,255
to drop it off at the museum.

951
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:11,149
Captain,
it's a radio station downtown.

952
01:02:11,326 --> 01:02:13,153
They just received a bomb threat.

953
01:02:14,037 --> 01:02:17,406
Sir, we're getting bomb threats
from all over the city.

954
01:02:17,916 --> 01:02:20,751
Sir, your wife received one too.
What do you wanna do?

955
01:02:22,461 --> 01:02:23,375
Send a squad car.

956
01:02:23,588 --> 01:02:24,412
Okay.

957
01:02:24,797 --> 01:02:27,253
Also notify the bomb squad, hospitals,

958
01:02:27,424 --> 01:02:28,504
fire department.

959
01:02:28,843 --> 01:02:29,756
Right away, sir.

960
01:02:33,598 --> 01:02:34,345
Hey boss.

961
01:02:36,017 --> 01:02:39,386
She says that uh,
she'll only talk to Nettles.

962
01:02:42,816 --> 01:02:44,060
Okay, do it.

963
01:02:45,609 --> 01:02:46,391
All right.

964
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,691
We're meeting with your boyfriend.

965
01:02:51,241 --> 01:02:53,067
You have to convince them
to let me go.

966
01:02:53,242 --> 01:02:57,286
It's your only chance to stop him.
Look, use me as the bait.

967
01:02:58,331 --> 01:02:59,789
There's not a lot of time.

968
01:03:03,252 --> 01:03:04,414
Hey, I've been looking for you.

969
01:03:04,587 --> 01:03:07,078
Here's a list of buildings
Brandon Manning designed.

970
01:03:08,007 --> 01:03:10,083
This guy's done
some pretty major stuff?

971
01:03:10,593 --> 01:03:12,252
He even designed
the new wing at City Hall.

972
01:03:51,132 --> 01:03:52,508
I can't see.

973
01:04:01,351 --> 01:04:02,346
Thank you.

974
01:04:22,914 --> 01:04:23,614
Shit!

975
01:04:30,505 --> 01:04:31,371
Vincent.

976
01:04:31,548 --> 01:04:32,876
Vincent, do tou hear me?

977
01:04:33,633 --> 01:04:36,171
Swan, we're settin' up
the fuel-air explosives.

978
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:38,883
Set it up and tell me
when you're ready.

979
01:04:39,346 --> 01:04:41,256
All right, hurry up,
come on, move out.

980
01:05:15,591 --> 01:05:16,967
Captain Winters.

981
01:05:17,134 --> 01:05:19,210
You gotta get the okay
to let the girl go.

982
01:05:19,429 --> 01:05:20,287
Let her go?

983
01:05:20,303 --> 01:05:23,305
I mean, we gotta use her.
She's our only chance.

984
01:05:24,975 --> 01:05:27,929
I'm not bullshitting you, Captain.
I wouldn't bullshit you about this.

985
01:05:29,856 --> 01:05:31,979
If you let that girl go,
I'll catch this creep.

986
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:40,271
Is the tracking device on the girl?

987
01:05:41,283 --> 01:05:43,359
The ankle transmitter is in place.

988
01:05:54,129 --> 01:05:55,244
The tracking transmitter is working.

989
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:58,924
The tracking transmitter is working.
We're good to go with the drop-off.

990
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:04,509
Okay, I got her.

991
01:06:04,974 --> 01:06:06,634
I got her, she's right here.

992
01:06:12,063 --> 01:06:12,930
There you go.

993
01:06:17,361 --> 01:06:19,068
You're lucky we still have that.

994
01:06:19,696 --> 01:06:21,571
Some guy says he was your lawyer,

995
01:06:22,282 --> 01:06:23,657
tried to take your property.

996
01:06:25,286 --> 01:06:26,317
All right, go on, get outta here.

997
01:06:28,121 --> 01:06:29,152
Go on, get out of here.

998
01:06:52,353 --> 01:06:55,022
I'm goin' northbound on Sixth.
I'm goin' northbound on Sixth.

999
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:03,110
Moving northbound.
Repeat, northbound.

1000
01:07:03,781 --> 01:07:06,106
Position One she's not
headed your way.

1001
01:07:06,284 --> 01:07:07,908
She's headed northbound on Sixth.

1002
01:07:08,077 --> 01:07:10,651
She's headed northbound on
the Sixth Street alleyway.

1003
01:07:17,795 --> 01:07:20,998
She's headin' towards the flea market.
She's headin' towards the flea market.

1004
01:07:24,385 --> 01:07:26,129
Captain she's moving fast.

1005
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:40,564
Stop right there!

1006
01:07:48,492 --> 01:07:52,241
Swan, the device is armed and
standing by for your word to activate.

1007
01:07:52,538 --> 01:07:53,487
Activate.

1008
01:07:56,375 --> 01:07:57,205
Activate.

1009
01:07:58,919 --> 01:07:59,915
Activate stage one.

1010
01:08:22,026 --> 01:08:23,484
She's in a black BMW.

1011
01:08:23,651 --> 01:08:27,235
L-Q-Y-A-1-niner,
westbound on Vermont.

1012
01:08:36,623 --> 01:08:38,284
Don't I even get a thank you?

1013
01:08:48,135 --> 01:08:49,048
Bye boys.

1014
01:09:15,328 --> 01:09:16,407
We've lost her.

1015
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:18,871
The transmitter has
been found abandoned.

1016
01:09:22,585 --> 01:09:24,293
Repeat, we've lost her.

1017
01:09:34,681 --> 01:09:37,302
What were you thinking,
trying to take the watch?

1018
01:09:37,517 --> 01:09:38,715
What, you gonna ditch me?

1019
01:09:39,226 --> 01:09:40,768
Now you yourself said

1020
01:09:40,937 --> 01:09:44,186
that the painting is far more
important than the artist.

1021
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:46,438
And what about our masterpiece?

1022
01:09:47,026 --> 01:09:48,734
Nothing can be allowed

1023
01:09:48,902 --> 01:09:51,607
to interfere with the
creative process that we share.

1024
01:09:53,365 --> 01:09:54,396
You're right.

1025
01:09:55,951 --> 01:09:58,489
A masterpiece that'll be
discussed, admired,

1026
01:09:58,662 --> 01:10:00,571
and studied for centuries to come.

1027
01:10:00,831 --> 01:10:02,658
Our Michelangelo.

1028
01:10:04,126 --> 01:10:05,157
Is everything in place?

1029
01:10:05,629 --> 01:10:06,707
Of course.

1030
01:10:08,756 --> 01:10:09,538
Pull over.

1031
01:10:12,718 --> 01:10:14,426
It's time to trigger the decoy.

1032
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:17,008
Our masterpiece.

1033
01:10:18,307 --> 01:10:19,089
Yes.

1034
01:10:20,810 --> 01:10:22,849
Our masterpiece.

1035
01:10:25,105 --> 01:10:27,145
I did this all for you, you know?

1036
01:10:29,567 --> 01:10:30,682
I love ya.

1037
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:31,892
I know.

1038
01:10:36,992 --> 01:10:39,364
Reverse the charges, my love.

1039
01:10:54,051 --> 01:10:57,965
Please reach out and touch someone.

1040
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:07,178
Oh dear.

1041
01:11:33,006 --> 01:11:34,204
Swan's car just went.

1042
01:11:34,382 --> 01:11:37,336
- What about Claire?
- Looks like it took 'em both out.

1043
01:11:40,471 --> 01:11:42,963
Hang on, there's something a
little strange about this.

1044
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,638
...placed throughout the city...
- Glass.

1045
01:11:46,227 --> 01:11:47,009
Glass!

1046
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:49,346
Only the male suspect is there.

1047
01:11:49,522 --> 01:11:51,016
Claire's gone.

1048
01:11:51,191 --> 01:11:54,441
...opening of the new wing,
designed by the late Brandon Manning...

1049
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:55,986
will go off without a hitch.

1050
01:11:56,153 --> 01:11:58,063
This is Jamie Rosen
for Channel Six News

1051
01:11:58,238 --> 01:12:01,490
reporting live from the Masquerade
Ball at City Hall. Back to you, Don.

1052
01:12:01,659 --> 01:12:04,529
Jamie, we're heard that the traffic
down there is absolutely terrible

1053
01:12:04,704 --> 01:12:06,246
Hey are you there?

1054
01:12:06,413 --> 01:12:08,323
Come in man are you there?
Nettles, are you there?

1055
01:12:08,499 --> 01:12:10,906
- I know where she is.
- How do you know where she is?

1056
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:13,962
She's gonna blow City Hall.
Meet me there.

1057
01:12:14,922 --> 01:12:17,495
Go around the City Hall,
make sure backup's in place.

1058
01:12:17,675 --> 01:12:19,632
All right, call for TJ.
I got my hands full.

1059
01:12:19,844 --> 01:12:20,923
See if he's close.

1060
01:12:28,602 --> 01:12:29,634
Nettles, where are you?

1061
01:12:33,858 --> 01:12:36,264
Tell me what you see.
Keep talkin' to me.

1062
01:12:37,695 --> 01:12:39,522
I'm movin' as fast as I can, man.

1063
01:12:45,994 --> 01:12:47,406
Hurry up, meet me in the lobby.

1064
01:13:08,225 --> 01:13:09,552
Okay men, get ready.

1065
01:13:09,726 --> 01:13:11,136
- Got the radio on?
- Yeah.

1066
01:13:27,077 --> 01:13:29,484
This is the San Francisco police.
Put your weapons down.

1067
01:13:55,647 --> 01:13:57,889
Divert them so
I can get to the elevator.

1068
01:16:52,071 --> 01:16:53,649
Hey brother, what took you so long?

1069
01:16:57,952 --> 01:16:59,992
Claire's husband was about to blow
the whistle on the downtown

1070
01:17:00,162 --> 01:17:02,451
redevelopment zone.
It's a toxic waste dump.

1071
01:17:02,665 --> 01:17:05,120
Would've cost a fortune to clean up.
But before he could,

1072
01:17:05,293 --> 01:17:06,407
he got capped.

1073
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:08,454
So now Claire wants revenge.

1074
01:17:08,629 --> 01:17:10,372
It's been her all along.

1075
01:17:10,714 --> 01:17:12,505
She's gonna blow this place up, Glass.

1076
01:17:13,008 --> 01:17:14,882
All right listen, you take
the basement, I'll take the roof.

1077
01:17:15,053 --> 01:17:15,799
Okay.

1078
01:17:30,817 --> 01:17:32,727
Move away from the building.

1079
01:17:33,112 --> 01:17:34,060
Stay calm.

1080
01:17:34,863 --> 01:17:37,105
Step back away from the building.

1081
01:17:50,879 --> 01:17:51,704
Stay back.

1082
01:19:01,991 --> 01:19:02,738
Grenade! Go!

1083
01:19:02,908 --> 01:19:03,768
Go! Go!

1084
01:20:38,503 --> 01:20:39,666
Claire, put your hands in the air.

1085
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:40,704
Now.

1086
01:20:40,922 --> 01:20:42,547
Don't make me do this.

1087
01:20:42,716 --> 01:20:43,995
Don't make me do this.

1088
01:20:47,471 --> 01:20:48,799
Don't make me do this.

1089
01:20:51,433 --> 01:20:52,762
I'm afraid it's time.

1090
01:20:55,853 --> 01:20:57,347
Put your hands in the air Claire.

1091
01:20:57,522 --> 01:20:59,230
Come on.
Put you hands in the air, now.

1092
01:21:01,818 --> 01:21:03,775
My husband never got his due.

1093
01:21:04,278 --> 01:21:05,773
That's all gonna change now.

1094
01:21:14,871 --> 01:21:16,117
Son of a bitch.

1095
01:21:19,669 --> 01:21:20,368
Glass.

1096
01:21:20,961 --> 01:21:23,631
Glass, I'm in the basement.
Claire's out cold.

1097
01:21:23,923 --> 01:21:25,999
There's a bomb, it's set to go off
in ten minutes.

1098
01:21:26,758 --> 01:21:27,839
What do I do?

1099
01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:30,049
Do you read me, Glass? Glass.

1100
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:33,171
Okay Nettles.

1101
01:21:34,184 --> 01:21:35,008
Shit.

1102
01:21:35,018 --> 01:21:35,966
All right,

1103
01:21:37,394 --> 01:21:39,969
Glass, I got a ticker down here
and I don't know what to do.

1104
01:21:40,147 --> 01:21:42,270
Wejust got our first
North American FAE bomb.

1105
01:21:42,941 --> 01:21:45,611
That's a Fuel Air Explosive.
It'll take up to a square mile.

1106
01:21:45,779 --> 01:21:47,236
T minus ten minutes.

1107
01:21:51,784 --> 01:21:54,535
Now you better get down here
and help me, help me with this bomb.

1108
01:21:54,954 --> 01:21:55,867
Nettles,

1109
01:21:56,539 --> 01:21:58,199
I got a FAE bomb up here.

1110
01:21:58,374 --> 01:22:01,957
In case you're wondering what that is.
Black ops use these over in Africa, man.

1111
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:06,671
It's a wide cloud of highly unstable
gas suspended over the city.

1112
01:22:07,007 --> 01:22:08,382
When it's ignited the shock...

1113
01:22:08,551 --> 01:22:10,792
waves will shoot down
and kill everybody breathing.

1114
01:22:12,013 --> 01:22:15,346
Now something tells me that you
got the detonator down there with you.

1115
01:22:15,515 --> 01:22:16,760
Glass, I'm gonna die down here.

1116
01:22:16,934 --> 01:22:18,096
Just relax, brother.

1117
01:22:18,311 --> 01:22:19,223
Talk to me.

1118
01:22:19,394 --> 01:22:20,674
Glass, talk to me.

1119
01:22:20,937 --> 01:22:22,348
Glass, just tell me what to do.

1120
01:22:22,522 --> 01:22:25,476
- I'll do it. Just tell me what to do.
- Stay calm. You can do this.

1121
01:22:25,692 --> 01:22:27,768
Glass, I don't know what to do.
Tell me what to do!

1122
01:22:27,944 --> 01:22:29,273
- Talk to me!
- Now listen to me man,

1123
01:22:29,446 --> 01:22:31,652
you're just gonna have to go
beyond hope and fear.

1124
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:35,241
Don't be attached to living
or dying, or anything else.

1125
01:22:35,952 --> 01:22:38,704
And understand that death
is just another stage

1126
01:22:38,872 --> 01:22:40,414
on the playground.

1127
01:22:44,169 --> 01:22:45,662
You have to be able to feel it.

1128
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:47,162
And the way...

1129
01:22:47,381 --> 01:22:49,538
you'll be able to learn how to feel,

1130
01:22:49,758 --> 01:22:52,213
is by coming to know
the nature of your mind.

1131
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,761
And even if you do go today
you'll be back.

1132
01:23:04,272 --> 01:23:06,644
So if you're not attached
to living or dying,

1133
01:23:06,858 --> 01:23:09,645
you have nothing to fear. If you have
nothing to fear you're gonna calm down

1134
01:23:10,778 --> 01:23:13,779
and just listen to me gently
guide you through this.

1135
01:23:13,948 --> 01:23:14,814
All right?

1136
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:19,868
Okay, I've finished assessing,
I have taken a deep breath.

1137
01:23:20,038 --> 01:23:22,529
- Now what do we do?
- Can you get inside that ticker?

1138
01:23:22,707 --> 01:23:24,616
- What do you mean?
- Look around the back...

1139
01:23:24,792 --> 01:23:26,750
for something that looks like
it's sealed,

1140
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:28,793
it may even be sealed
with some kind of epoxy.

1141
01:23:28,963 --> 01:23:30,207
You wanna scrape that off...

1142
01:23:30,882 --> 01:23:32,079
and open it up.

1143
01:23:37,472 --> 01:23:40,555
Look around, there's a hole man.
There's a hole, look for the hole.

1144
01:23:50,693 --> 01:23:51,642
I see somethin'.

1145
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:01,615
I got an opening.

1146
01:24:01,912 --> 01:24:02,861
There you go.

1147
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,576
Okay reach in and tell me
what you feel. Gently.

1148
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:10,461
Heat, a lot of heat.

1149
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:11,958
Cold metal,

1150
01:24:12,964 --> 01:24:14,625
- somethin' soft.
- Don't touch that.

1151
01:24:14,799 --> 01:24:15,581
Okay.

1152
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:17,090
What else?

1153
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:19,546
Keep going man,
you're doing a good job.

1154
01:24:19,846 --> 01:24:21,045
Somethin' round...

1155
01:24:22,558 --> 01:24:23,340
and two wires.

1156
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:29,223
Two sets of wires, yellow...

1157
01:24:30,191 --> 01:24:31,732
and black with red.

1158
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,148
No, stop.

1159
01:24:36,113 --> 01:24:36,937
What's wrong?

1160
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:39,652
It's too easy. There's gotta be
another way. That's a set-up, man.

1161
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:40,904
There's gotta be another way.

1162
01:24:41,284 --> 01:24:42,280
Make up your mind.

1163
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:45,074
Ease your thumb over to the right.
Feel anything?

1164
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:54,744
Yeah, another round thing.

1165
01:24:55,257 --> 01:24:58,044
The device that you have there is
the decoy. It's very, very primitive.

1166
01:24:58,342 --> 01:25:00,002
You'll find two sets of wires.

1167
01:25:00,304 --> 01:25:01,714
Go to the timer

1168
01:25:02,638 --> 01:25:04,964
and try to pop
that switch straight out...

1169
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:07,515
and pull the yellow wires
out of the timer.

1170
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:10,892
Well which one's which?

1171
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:13,187
All right, it's up to you.
Pick one.

1172
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:14,182
What?

1173
01:25:14,192 --> 01:25:16,434
It's up to you Nettles, just pick one.

1174
01:25:54,356 --> 01:25:55,898
I did it. I'm not dead.

1175
01:25:56,234 --> 01:25:57,812
You did it brother. Now uh...

1176
01:25:59,862 --> 01:26:02,614
I got a whole shit storm up here
that I gotta deal with, so sit tight.

1177
01:27:35,290 --> 01:27:37,911
We're clear on the roof.
Repeat, clear on the roof.

1178
01:27:38,251 --> 01:27:40,659
- Send in the sweep team.
- Don't fire. Wait.

1179
01:27:41,586 --> 01:27:44,145
Class said it's over.

1180
01:27:55,967 --> 01:27:58,333
Go on man,
talk to them, they'll listen.

1181
01:28:00,122 --> 01:28:04,183
When everyone dies,
live the day.

1182
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,333
There is tunnel.
And that's a long tunnel.
