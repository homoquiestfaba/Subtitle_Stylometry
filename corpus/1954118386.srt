00:01:53,512 --> 00:01:56,647
<i>The Second World War</i>
<i>was in its decisive phase.</i>

2
00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:00,685
<i>The Battle of Stalingrad</i>
<i>was crucial.</i>

3
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:04,188
<i>The Germans had barricaded</i>
<i>themselves in</i>

4
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,223
<i>all over the city.</i>

5
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,424
<i>If they had taken Stalingrad,</i>

6
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,227
<i>they would have taken control</i>
<i>the Russian oil fields,</i>

7
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,663
<i>and Stalin would have</i>
<i>lost his advantage.</i>

8
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:15,700
<i>So he put his sick genius mind</i>
<i>into action</i>

9
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:18,169
<i>into winning the battle</i>
<i>at all costs.</i>

10
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:23,374
<i>Over 2 million people died</i>
<i>during that battle.</i>

11
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,257
[screaming]

12
00:02:43,862 --> 00:02:47,465
[screaming continues]

13
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:08,386
[yelling in German]

14
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:24,235
[screaming]

15
00:03:27,673 --> 00:03:30,274
[indistinct]

16
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,002
[machine gun fire]

17
00:04:38,944 --> 00:04:42,380
[yells]

18
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:12,076
[screaming]

19
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:59,990
[whimpering]

20
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:22,640
[man humming]

21
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:38,956
[continues humming]

22
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:22,233
- [gunfire]
- [screams]

23
00:08:48,793 --> 00:08:50,594
[flicks lighter]

24
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:56,567
We have no account as to how
this man Hans survived.

25
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:00,971
This is his diary.

26
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,074
I got it from a friend of mine
I grew up with in Scotland,

27
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,810
who's now with MI6.

28
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:12,049
The last entry is August 1944.

29
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:12,983
Couple of days later,

30
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:17,888
he allegedly killed himself
in a German psych ward.

31
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,026
- How is your German?
- Serviceable.

32
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:40,911
Okay, so why do we give a shit
about some lunatic's journal?

33
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,715
This is not some search
for the boogeyman, soldier.

34
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:49,119
This is about
biochemical genocide.

35
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,188
Exactly.

36
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,276
[heavy breathing]

37
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,068
[screeching]

38
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,909
[growling]

39
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:02,112
Stalin was always
one step ahead of Hitler,

40
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,782
trying to create
a race of super warriors.

41
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,885
Fortunately his experiments
were all destroyed

42
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,486
before the end of the war.

43
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:12,189
Some high-ranking officials
think the Russians

44
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:17,127
stumbled upon something
much more sinister.

45
00:13:17,295 --> 00:13:21,098
- The gas in the story?
- Yes.

46
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,966
You know,

47
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,536
I learned a lot about the Battle
of Stalingrad in training,

48
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,839
when they burned that city
halfway down to the ground.

49
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:32,109
Never heard anything about
poisonous gas though.

50
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,579
That's because forces
napalmed the south side.

51
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:36,380
Burnt it all.

52
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:42,085
It was the only way
to control the infection.

53
00:13:44,956 --> 00:13:47,024
[growling]

54
00:14:10,148 --> 00:14:13,383
[growling]

55
00:14:22,894 --> 00:14:29,032
[heavy breathing]

56
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:41,078
That's funny, sir. Is that
the new official ghost story

57
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,413
to scare the recruits?

58
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,047
I wish.

59
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,150
Very few people
knew about the gas.

60
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,920
They destroyed
all records of it.

61
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,890
Nobody wanted to admit
any atrocities occurred.

62
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,225
So there's no evidence of this.

63
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,929
[scoffs]
You're holding the evidence.

64
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,998
That's all we ever got.

65
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,468
Why are you telling me
about this big secret now?

66
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:09,239
The last 24 hours,
reports come out of Bulgaria

67
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,408
reporting an incident
that matches

68
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,212
what's written about
in that diary.

69
00:15:17,215 --> 00:15:18,048
There's a base.

70
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,051
On the base,
there's a munitions warehouse.

71
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,053
This warehouse goes
8 floors deep

72
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,555
and holds 80 years' worth
of weapons.

73
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,691
With the Russians
and Bulgarians alliance

74
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:28,992
after the Second World War,

75
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,194
we think there's a good chance
that that gas

76
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:32,963
is somewhere inside
that warehouse.

77
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,565
So have one of our contacts
check it out.

78
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,001
[chuckles]
We don't think the Bulgarians

79
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,637
have any idea
what they are sitting on.

80
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,142
We need to find it,
secure it at any cost.

81
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,144
So how are you getting me in?

82
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,679
<i>There have been a string</i>
<i>of arms thefts</i>

83
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:52,616
<i>at several military bases</i>
<i>throughout Eastern Europe.</i>

84
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:57,054
<i>Your cover will be as</i>
<i>Captain John McGahey,</i>

85
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,055
<i>arsenal inspector.</i>

86
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:01,224
<i>You'll be investigating</i>
<i>a robbery in the warehouse</i>

87
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,026
<i>at the same base.</i>

88
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,595
<i>Your job is to get into</i>
<i>this warehouse</i>

89
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:08,966
<i>and report back</i>
<i>anything you find.</i>

90
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:14,471
<i>Your contact will be</i>
<i>military doctor Ana Bennett.</i>

91
00:16:20,044 --> 00:16:22,279
<i>Anything with this insignia,</i>

92
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:27,317
<i>you report back to me</i>
<i>and only me.</i>

93
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:38,195
Captain John McGahey.

94
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,330
- At ease, sir.
- Welcome to Bulgaria, sir.

95
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:45,235
Pvt. Harold Miller at your
service. Let me take your bag.

96
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,703
How long is the drive?

97
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,772
- It's a couple hours, sir.
- Perfect.

98
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:53,310
- Wake me up when we get close.
- Yes, sir.

99
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,125
Most of the locals here
work for the base.

100
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:43,760
It's the biggest employer.

101
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:48,098
Yeah, looks like
they're thriving.

102
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:52,769
Don't worry, private.
We were all young once.

103
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,471
We have an hour for lunch
before we're meeting

104
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,106
with the Bulgarian
commander Borov.

105
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,642
I can have it brought
to your room or--

106
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,478
I'll be skipping lunch.

107
00:18:01,512 --> 00:18:04,414
I need you to take me
to this address.

108
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,652
Sir, I don't have
authorization to--

109
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:12,422
- I just gave you authorization.
- Yes, sir.

110
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:49,893
- Who let you in?
- Oh, hi.

111
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,195
- We're here from--
- Don't sass me!

112
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:56,833
You and your rowdy friends
better get out of here

113
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:59,669
before I call Virgil!

114
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,405
We'll only be a second, ma'am.

115
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,508
Charming woman.

116
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:14,818
Yes?

117
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,419
Hi. Is Dr. Bennett here?

118
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:19,523
Mommy told me not to
talk to strangers.

119
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:24,361
Oh, uh, my name is John.
What's yours?

120
00:19:27,331 --> 00:19:27,898
Miriam.

121
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,734
Hi, Miriam. See?
Now we're not strangers.

122
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:31,935
Is your mommy home?

123
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,603
She's asleep.

124
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:37,541
Oh. I have some really important
questions to ask her.

125
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,943
You think we come in
for a bit?

126
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:43,880
Mommy told me not to let
strangers inside.

127
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:44,814
That's a really good rule.

128
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:50,587
How about you go get your mommy,
and we will wait here?

129
00:19:51,355 --> 00:19:54,357
Maybe you should come inside.

130
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,360
My Aunt Koina
might try to get you.

131
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,863
Sounds good.

132
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,965
You look pretty.

133
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,202
I made you coffee.

134
00:20:06,737 --> 00:20:07,604
Can I help you?

135
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:08,939
Hi. I'm Captain John McGahey.

136
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,975
I'm here regarding
that report you filed.

137
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:15,879
Would you like
coffee or milk?

138
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,913
No, thank you, sweetie.

139
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,883
Is there someplace a little bit
more private we can speak?

140
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,520
Mm-hmm.
We can talk through there.

141
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,688
Great.

142
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,522
Hey, Miriam,

143
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:29,960
would you mind showing Pvt.
Miller here some of your toys?

144
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:32,229
Sure.

145
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,431
Thank you.

146
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:38,935
Okay, who do you got here?

147
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,905
This is Mr. Bunny.

148
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,778
So I was looking over
your file and, uh,

149
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,847
is it true you were
put on temporary leave?

150
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,817
More like
indefinite suspension.

151
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,385
Who suspended you?

152
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,887
Bulgarian commanding officer,
Colonel Borov.

153
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:00,757
He claimed my report
was grossly negligent,

154
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,461
and I was liable
for what happened.

155
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:06,997
What did happen?

156
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,600
You won't believe me
if I told you.

157
00:21:11,569 --> 00:21:12,469
Trust me.

158
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:17,674
If nobody believed you,
they wouldn't have sent me.

159
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,376
I was on duty last week.

160
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,545
And lift up.

161
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:26,349
Thank you, private.
You can get dressed now.

162
00:21:27,018 --> 00:21:27,817
[coughs]

163
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:31,554
- We might be able to save it.
- Might?

164
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:36,293
You can start by
staying away from brothels.

165
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:40,363
Dr. Bennett,
chemical emergency!

166
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:42,999
So what have we got?

167
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,869
They say a stack of barrels
in the munitions warehouse

168
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:46,870
collapsed on him.

169
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:49,906
Punctured lungs,
a few broken bones in his face.

170
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,809
He was down on minus eight.

171
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:57,314
[steady beeping]

172
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,717
Dr. Bennett, he's gone.

173
00:22:04,522 --> 00:22:07,023
He's brain dead.
His heart stopped.

174
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:12,395
The respirator is the only thing
that's keeping him alive.

175
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:16,666
Time of death, 6:05 p.m.

176
00:22:44,028 --> 00:22:45,762
And the next thing I saw

177
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:50,433
was him standing up
and attacking my nurse.

178
00:22:50,901 --> 00:22:52,469

180
00:23:20,731 --> 00:23:22,098
What happened to the body?

181
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,801
- I heard they cremated it.
- Great.

182
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,437
Colonel Borov said
he'd take care of the report.

183
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,006
He wrote that the patient
was hallucinating

184
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,842
and wanted me to sign off on it.

185
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,144
It's bullshit.

186
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,545
It wasn't drugs.

187
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:38,581
The patient went ballistic
after he was dead.

188
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,917
I insisted on revising it.

189
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,487
He got furious,
accused me of being incompetent

190
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:46,790
and responsible for both deaths,

191
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,158
then suspended me.

192
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,693
That's when I sent in
my complaint.

193
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,996
Is there any evidence
of this?

194
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,831
Photos, videos, anything?

195
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:58,935
Whatever we had
was confiscated by Borov.

196
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,837
What caused this?

197
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,607
A biochemical substance
we believe is here on-site.

198
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,877
Now what floor did you say
your patient was injured on?

199
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:11,614
Lowest floor, level 8.

200
00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:15,552
With the U.S. taking over,

201
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:19,956
most of the major duties
are split between both armies.

202
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,225
How's that working out?

203
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,461
Good.

204
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:24,928
Really?

205
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,997
Well, Bulgarians are upset
about losing control.

206
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,966
And the Americans hate
that the Bulgarians

207
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,569
are slowing down
the transition so much.

208
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:36,639

Captain McGahey.

Thank you, Colonel.

212
00:25:13,077 --> 00:25:20,016
Bulgarian army has always been
respected throughout the world.

213
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,653
It is a shame they are giving
this base over to foreigners.

214
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:27,857
Maybe the Americans boys will
teach you guys a thing or two.

[shouts in Bulgarian]

216
00:25:31,662 --> 00:25:34,297
Colonel, I'm gonna need access
to all your warehouses

217
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:37,667
and munitions'
storage facilities.

218
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:38,701
I'm sorry, Captain.

219
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:43,172
Those warehouses are only opened
in the event of war.

220
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,241
Why would such a respected army
want to fight

221
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:47,810
with weapons from World War II?

222
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:50,013
With the string of robberies
you've been having

223
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:53,650
in the past year,
the international authorities

224
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:56,052
would like a more updated record
of your inventory.

225
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,955
And since the base will be
turned over to Major Stone soon,

226
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:01,691
that shouldn't be a problem,
should it, Colonel?

227
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:05,328
The base, yes,
but not the warehouses.

228
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,731
Those will still be
in my responsibility.

229
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:12,569
Listen, Colonel, if you want
to keep your position here,

230
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,038
I suggest you find a way
to make this happen,

231
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,840
otherwise you may be
replaced a little bit sooner

232

your Bulgarian

Miriam?

375
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:40,769
Have you seen my daughter?

376
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,905
A little girl.

377
00:40:44,774 --> 00:40:46,575
My baby?

378
00:40:48,011 --> 00:40:49,978
Miriam.

379
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,518
I'm sorry.

380
00:40:58,188 --> 00:41:00,088
Baby?

381
00:41:32,255 --> 00:41:35,224
Have you seen my daughter?
Little girl?

382
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:36,758
She's got long curly hair.

383
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,893
Dr. Bennett, Dr. Bennett.

384
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:40,829
Private, have you seen
my daughter Miriam?

385
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,197
No, I haven't, but I promise
I'll help you look.

386
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:45,767
We were walking through.
We completely got separated.

387
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,703
It was like a flood of people
coming through.

388
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,137
Breathe.
Dr. Bennett, breathe. Slower.

389
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:52,007
And I couldn't hold her.
She just completely--

390
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,542
- Dr. Bennett!
- She's out of here--

391
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,577
Dr. Bennett, we're gonna
find her. Don't worry.

392
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:56,945
- But how do you know?
- I know.

393
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,814
Listen to me. There are
two entrances to the bunker.

394
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:01,583
- One's there, one's over there.
- She could be locked outside!

395
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:03,018
- She isn't!
- But she might be!

396
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,054
No, she's not! Nobody's gonna
leave a child outside

397
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:07,556
in these conditions!
No one!

398
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:10,225
She's probably in the bunker.
I'm sure of it.

399
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:12,995
- Sure?
- I promise you, okay?

400
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:15,097
- And I'll help you find her.
- Please.

401
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:18,867
First you have to help
these people, okay?

402
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:22,070
She's a kid. She's cut.

403
00:42:24,173 --> 00:42:27,242
Okay, let me take a look.

404
00:42:28,745 --> 00:42:30,312
How did this happen?

405
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:34,783
We were running, and then I got
shoved against something.

406
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:38,987
I thought it was just a scratch,
but it won't stop bleeding.

407
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,889
It looks like a deep scratch.

408
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:45,928
I can have it patched up,
and you'll be fine, okay?

409
00:42:46,596 --> 00:42:50,132
Maybe you should look away,
sweetheart.

410
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,967
Do your parents live on base?

411
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:54,002
No. My brother
is a soldier here,

412
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:56,171
so we stayed with him
last night.

413
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:59,274
We were going to head up
the coast today.

414
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:02,644
For a nice romantic weekend.

415
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:08,951
When we will be able
to go home?

416
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,218
Not for a while yet.

417
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:14,156
But you'll be safe in here.
Don't worry.

418
00:43:15,325 --> 00:43:16,892
Get some rest.

419
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:19,094
Thank you.

No. No, sir.

427
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:12,768
Just some live drills today
to keep the troops sharp.

428
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:17,806
Yeah, yeah, we informed
all the news agencies.

[door closes]

430
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:22,511
Let me call you back.

431
00:46:29,085 --> 00:46:31,186
You're late.

432
00:46:32,989 --> 00:46:34,823
Do you know
what you've done?

433
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:38,393
All hell has broken loose.

434
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:40,962
We have to declare
a state of emergency.

435
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:45,066
Emergency?
What are you babbling about?

436
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:48,503
You haven't seen anything yet,
have you?

437
00:46:51,507 --> 00:46:54,276
My daughter did this to me.

438
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:56,978
Jesus!

439
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,979
My own daughter.

441
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:03,919
Call Sofia.

442
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:04,820
I did.

443
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:09,124
Everyone thinks this is
part of our annual drills.

444
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:11,993
You a goddamn war criminal.

445
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:15,864
Cut the bullshit.
Go get that checked.

446
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:17,966
Help me.

General, we have a problem.

451
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:35,183
Yes, sir, I know what I said,
but this is not a drill.

452
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:38,854
We have to issue
a code red alert.

Harold,
have you found Miriam?

455
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:50,365
I'm sorry. I looked everywhere.
She's not in the bunker.

456
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,033
I'm sorry.

457
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,002
- Everywhere?
- Yeah.

458
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:58,473
Don't worry. Once we can go out,
I'll help you find her.

459
00:48:05,615 --> 00:48:07,215
Shit.

460
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,584

Harold...

462
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:14,456
There are infected people
in here, Harold.

463
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:18,526
Infected?
What do you mean?

464
00:48:19,562 --> 00:48:22,497
We have to get out
of the bunker now.

465
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:24,099
No. We're not allowed.

466
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:28,203
Look-- Look at their eyes.
We have to go.

467
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:33,008
We're not allowed to open the
bunker at any circumstances.

468
00:48:34,677 --> 00:48:37,646
- We're gonna find Miriam.
- It's not about Miriam!

Harold, hurry up!

00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,568
- Why was the bunker opened?
- Move!

Sorry, private.

Nothing to be sorry about.

477
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,349
Where are we going?
Where are we going?

478
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:50,185
We're going to the bridge.

479
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:52,287
Stop! Stop the jeep!

What do you think
you're doing? Wait!

482
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:58,259
- I'm going to find my daughter!
- No, you're not! Stay here!

483
00:49:58,261 --> 00:49:59,194
Get off of me, Harold!

484
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:01,696
That's suicide,
and you know that!

485
00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:03,999
If she is out there,
I will find her!

486
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:07,135
You know the odds.

487
00:50:09,472 --> 00:50:12,774
Okay, but I guess
I'm coming with you.

488
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:14,776
I want to stay with you.

489
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:16,678
- Are you sure?
- We'll be safer with you.

490
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:21,216
- What do you think?
- Okay, so let's go!

Hey, Miriam, is that you?

494
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:00,588
Hey, don't be scared.

495
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,123
I'm your friend, remember?

496
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:03,792
Look, it's me.
It's John.

497
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:06,828
I'm your friend, remember?
Can you help me?

498
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,696
Are-- Are you a criminal?

499
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:11,366
No, no, no.
No, I am your friend.

500
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:13,802
Look, I need you
to help me out, okay?

501
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:16,604
Then why did they lock you up?

502
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:19,707
Some mean people
were picking on me.

503
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:21,242
Ivan picks on me, too.

504
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,377
I know Ivan picks on you.

505
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:24,379
Find the policeman.
He has the keys to this door.

506
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:27,649
I need you to find him and
get them to unlock the door.

507
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:29,551
Hurry up.

508
00:51:33,522 --> 00:51:35,256
No, I don't want to.

509
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,257
You're a big girl now.

510
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,692
If you find the keys
and get me out of here,

511
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:39,727
I can protect you
from all the bad guys

512
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:40,829
who were chasing you, okay?

513
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:44,866
You need to do it fast.
I need you to hurry.

514
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:46,468
Go on. Come on.

515
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:50,371
Come on, sweetie.
You can do it. Hurry up.

516
00:51:55,744 --> 00:51:59,614
Did you find him yet?
Miriam?

517
00:52:21,203 --> 00:52:23,271
Stand back!

Come on, sweetie.

521
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:10,318
You killed the bad guys?

522
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,420
Yeah. You and your rabbit
are safe.

523
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:15,256
His name is Mr. Bunny.

524
00:53:15,591 --> 00:53:19,227
So why are you out here
all alone?

525
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:20,361
Where's your mom?

526
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,263
I lost her on the way
to the bunker.

527
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:23,765
Hey, don't cry.
Listen to me.

528
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:26,868
I'm gonna get you back
to your mom, okay?

529
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,704
I promise.

530
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,573
Let's go.

531
00:53:45,821 --> 00:53:48,223
[horn honks]

532
00:54:02,805 --> 00:54:03,938
Soldier, open the barrier!

533
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,274
- Sorry, sir, we can't.
- Do you know who I am?

534
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:09,510
Yes, Colonel Borov, but we
have strict orders not to.

535
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:11,746
I'm the one who issued
that order!

536
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:14,649
- Let me through, soldier!
- Yes, sir!

537
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:18,319
Please! Take my baby!
Save him!

538
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:21,456
Get back! Get back!

539
00:54:55,924 --> 00:55:00,962
So is this what Captain McGahey
talked to you about?

540
00:55:01,463 --> 00:55:01,963
Yeah.

541
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,298
And what did he tell you?

542
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,334
He said that there were
some unstable weapons

543
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:07,335
in the warehouses.

544
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:11,906
He was investigating it.
He didn't tell me much.

545
00:55:15,544 --> 00:55:18,579
Go straight down,
turn right!

546
00:55:18,947 --> 00:55:22,317
They're not dying!

547
00:55:33,362 --> 00:55:34,829
Boss! Boss!

548
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:37,532
Take it easy, you sluts!

549
00:55:38,467 --> 00:55:41,402
Who did this?

550
00:55:44,707 --> 00:55:46,507
Anton, this is Italian leather!

551
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,976
Bring her to the bathroom,
clean her up!

552
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:53,381
I will take care of this punk!

553
00:55:53,482 --> 00:55:56,617
Nobody touches my girls!

554
00:55:57,086 --> 00:55:59,620
Ohh...

555
00:56:34,957 --> 00:56:37,525
[screams]

556
00:56:46,034 --> 00:56:48,936
Fucking kook!

557
00:56:53,008 --> 00:56:57,011
Man, I just saw
the most fucked-up thing!

558
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:04,919
She's dead.

559
00:57:07,022 --> 00:57:09,157
[knocking]

560
00:57:11,627 --> 00:57:13,528
[knocking]

561
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:17,999
I thought you said
she was dead.

562
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:28,009
[growling]

563
00:58:08,016 --> 00:58:12,253
[dialing]

564
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:14,956
[line ringing]

565
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:19,060
Borov, what the hell
is going on?

566
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:20,695
<i>[indistinct dialogue]</i>

567
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:23,731
I just had craziest thing
ever happened.

568
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:27,201
The whole town
is going to shit!

569
00:58:28,136 --> 00:58:30,238
Mainland? Why?

570
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:34,909
Code red?
Borov, why didn't you tell me?

571
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:37,578
What is code red?

572
00:58:50,893 --> 00:58:52,960
[screaming]

573
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:23,291
Miriam?

574
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:24,926
Baby?

575
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:27,562
Sweetheart?

576
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,001
She's been here.

577
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:36,871
We gotta leave now.

578
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:40,207
No. We have to look around.

579
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:44,312
Those footprints,
they're not hers.

580
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:48,115
[fire crackling]

581
00:59:53,288 --> 00:59:54,956
What are those?

582
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:56,657
Those are my dog tags.

583
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:58,759
[chuckles]
You're not a dog.

584
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:02,663
Soldiers wear these, too.
These were my dad's.

585
01:00:02,665 --> 01:00:05,099
- This is my school.
- Oh, yeah?

586
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,801
Do you have any kids?

587
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:09,270
A little girl just like you.

588
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,172
What's her name?

589
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:12,974
Olivia.

590
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:14,709
Where is she?

591
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:17,178
She's in heaven right now
with her mommy.

592
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:20,047
- [screeching]
- Get down!

593
01:01:13,301 --> 01:01:16,003
Miss Sarac?

594
01:01:17,139 --> 01:01:19,707
Miss Sarac?

595
01:01:39,795 --> 01:01:41,462
[screaming]

596
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:12,059
- [whimpering]
- Hey, Miriam, Miriam.

597
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:15,362
Come here to me.
It's okay, sweetie. Come on.

598
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:17,865
Come here. Okay.

599
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:22,002
- [sobbing]
- Shh...

600
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:23,738
Oh, I got you.

601
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:29,009
I got you. You're okay.
They're gone, they're gone.

602
01:02:30,812 --> 01:02:35,082
Hey, look who I got.
Mr. Bunny.

603
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:37,518
Here you go, baby.

604
01:02:39,955 --> 01:02:41,789
Let's go.

605
01:02:54,369 --> 01:02:57,438
- Look!
- Hey!

606
01:02:59,241 --> 01:03:00,875
We're saved!

607
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:03,477
- Hey!
- No! Villi! Dimo! Stop!

608
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:05,546
[gunfire]

609
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:07,481
No!

610
01:03:09,351 --> 01:03:10,384
Get in! Get in!

611
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:12,419
It's a code red.

612
01:04:41,309 --> 01:04:47,047
[gunfire]

613
01:05:24,286 --> 01:05:26,520
Miriam, come on.

614
01:05:30,058 --> 01:05:32,126
Up here.

615
01:05:38,934 --> 01:05:42,269
Here. Get down.
Get down.

616
01:05:48,476 --> 01:05:51,145
Down, down, down.

617
01:06:02,958 --> 01:06:06,694
They cremating people?

618
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:09,129
No, sweetie.

619
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:11,065
Down, down.

620
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:15,002
I think they're staring
to move away.

621
01:06:15,337 --> 01:06:17,571
It's okay.

622
01:06:22,610 --> 01:06:25,045
Miriam...

623
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:27,114
Don't cry, okay?

624
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:30,084
All right?

625
01:06:31,052 --> 01:06:33,620
How's Mr. Bunny doing?

626
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:37,224
Is he doing all right?
Is he scared?

627
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:38,592
A bit.

628
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:41,662
You'll see your mommy soon.

629
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,030
Okay?

630
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:47,101
Smile. It's okay.

631
01:06:49,004 --> 01:06:50,437
We're pretty close
to the bunker.

632
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:54,241
You can rest when you see
your mommy. How about that?

633
01:06:54,243 --> 01:06:57,277
Five more minutes?

634
01:07:01,416 --> 01:07:03,117
John?

635
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:04,184
Yeah?

636
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:05,185
I'm hungry.

637
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:07,688
All right, sweetie.
Let's get you some grub.

638
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:11,392
- Eww.
- [chuckles]

639
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:15,062
[banging]

640
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:17,531
Miriam... hang on!

641
01:07:29,344 --> 01:07:30,477
Freeze! On your knees!

642
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:32,513
- There's infected coming!
- [gunfire]

643
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:34,314
On your knees or we'll shoot!

644
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:37,751
I said there's infected coming!

645
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:41,155
Come on! Get down!

646
01:08:26,701 --> 01:08:28,335
We're clean. Let us in.

647
01:08:28,337 --> 01:08:29,870
We're not allowed
to take anyone.

648
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:31,238
Come on.
You know you can do it.

649
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:34,541
We can't take anyone alive.

650
01:08:36,711 --> 01:08:38,745
- At least take the child.
- No!

651
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:42,416
Miriam, it's okay.
Look, you'll be safe with them.

652
01:08:42,418 --> 01:08:45,652
No! I wanna stay with you.
Please!

653
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:50,524
A code red is in effect.
We're giving you a privilege.

654
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:52,693
A privilege? Take the girl.

655
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:55,629
A privilege
that won't last long.

656
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:59,333
Move along while you
still have the chance.

657
01:09:01,669 --> 01:09:03,770
Come on, Miriam.

658
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,347
It's okay.

659
01:09:34,369 --> 01:09:37,437
[engine failing]

660
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:39,473
Shit.

661
01:09:42,243 --> 01:09:44,311
[sighs]

662
01:09:45,313 --> 01:09:47,614
Ana, that's it.

663
01:09:47,616 --> 01:09:49,516
We have to head
to the bridge now.

664
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:52,352
- We've got to keep on going.
- Ana, I'm sorry!

665
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,188
The chances
of a small child surviving

666
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:57,724
in these circumstances
for this long are not good.

667
01:09:57,726 --> 01:10:02,296
If she's out there,
I'm gonna find her.

668
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:04,298
Where--

669
01:10:05,867 --> 01:10:09,336
Where are you going?
Where are you gonna go?

670
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:10,837
I don't know!

671
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:13,907
- Stop!
- Get off me!

672
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:14,975
Listen to me!

673
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:17,344
Miriam's a smart kid.
Think about it.

674
01:10:17,346 --> 01:10:19,580
If she's out there,
I'm sure she's with someone

675
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:23,750
who's taking her
to the goddamn bridge.

676
01:10:23,752 --> 01:10:28,555
Okay? It's her best option.

677
01:10:30,425 --> 01:10:32,292
We gotta go.

678
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:36,363
- And we gotta go now.
- Okay.

679
01:10:49,844 --> 01:10:54,982
If anyone tries to cross,
shoot without warning.

680
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:57,751
We've lost contact
with two more patrols,

681
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:00,320
and another patrol
ran out of gas.

682
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:02,923
Most of their men
were killed by--

683
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:05,726
Shut down every grid,
Lieutenant.

684
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:06,994
Code 227.

685
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:10,497
Nobody can leave the town.
Put the planes on alert.

686
01:11:10,499 --> 01:11:12,766
We'll strike
at first sunlight.

687
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:17,871
But this code was used last
during the Second World War.

688
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:19,306
Sorry?

689
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:21,608
Yes, sir!

690
01:11:38,026 --> 01:11:39,693
We need backup.

691
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:43,330
I repeat, we need backup!

692
01:11:44,832 --> 01:11:46,400
Down, Miriam.

693
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:47,668
Shh! Okay.

694
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:50,737
Miriam, we're gonna play
a little game, all right?

695
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:51,605
What game?

696
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:55,842
I need you to close your eyes
and count to ten real slow.

697
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:57,978
- Okay? Can you do that for me.
- Yeah, okay.

698
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,714
Whatever you do,
whatever you hear,

699
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:04,718
no matter what,
don't peek, okay?

700
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,887
Go.

701
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:10,057
One...

702
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:12,426
two...

703
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:14,428
three...

704
01:12:18,366 --> 01:12:20,667
four...

705
01:12:34,015 --> 01:12:37,117
Please...
I have two small kids.

706
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:39,986
But you're fine with
shooting and burning

707
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:42,956
other people's children, right?

708
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:46,126
Here's your privilege.

709
01:12:46,128 --> 01:12:47,060
Die human.

710
01:12:47,062 --> 01:12:50,397
- [gunshot]
- ...ten.

711
01:12:52,667 --> 01:12:53,934
Good job, sweetie.

712
01:12:53,936 --> 01:12:57,437
Good job.
Come on, let's go.

713
01:13:12,787 --> 01:13:16,056
- What's your name?
- Alex, sir.

714
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:18,158
Take us to the bridge
and live, Alex.

715
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,026
Watch your head, Miriam.

716
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:23,163
- Got her?
- Yup.

717
01:13:30,838 --> 01:13:35,041
Drive! Move this thing.

718
01:13:40,548 --> 01:13:42,549
Relax, Alex.
I'm American special forces.

719
01:13:42,551 --> 01:13:44,918
I need you to take the girl
and me to the bridge.

720
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,821
- Can you do that?
- Of course.

721
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:49,823
But we are running out of gas.

722
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:51,825
We can drive less than a mile.

723
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:56,496
We have to go
to a gas station.

724
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:59,566
Well, find one.

725
01:14:00,134 --> 01:14:03,904
You cold, sweetie?

726
01:14:06,908 --> 01:14:11,678
There you go. All right. Shh.
Don't think about it.

727
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,046
Back to sleep.

728
01:14:13,048 --> 01:14:15,649
Shh.

729
01:14:23,724 --> 01:14:25,692
- Harold?
- Yeah.

730
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:27,994
We need to take some water.

731
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:32,098
Then we've gotta
carry on moving.

732
01:14:38,973 --> 01:14:43,610
I'm gonna go through the door
on the right.

733
01:14:44,846 --> 01:14:45,745
Clear.

734
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:48,715
All right, I'll cover you.

735
01:14:52,053 --> 01:14:53,920
[gate rattles]

736
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:56,089
Locked.

737
01:15:10,905 --> 01:15:13,507
[laughs]

738
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:15,976
Come on.

739
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:24,885
Thank you, God!

740
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:27,854
Can you get us
close to the pump?

741
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:31,591
Uh, no, this is it.

742
01:15:33,594 --> 01:15:36,162
All right.

743
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:39,232
Miriam, wait here.

744
01:16:04,659 --> 01:16:05,859
You're kidding me.
It's too short.

745
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:10,664
Go inside. Find something
to put gas in it.

746
01:16:29,584 --> 01:16:31,651
Drop it.

747
01:16:31,953 --> 01:16:34,220
Don't even think to shout.

748
01:16:34,222 --> 01:16:36,189
Move.

749
01:16:36,757 --> 01:16:38,258
Move!

750
01:16:45,132 --> 01:16:49,102
Put down your weapon!
Now! Do it!

751
01:16:50,705 --> 01:16:53,340
Don't make me ask you again!

752
01:16:54,976 --> 01:16:58,078
Mommy? Mommy!

753
01:16:58,813 --> 01:17:02,148
- Dr. Bennett?
- Miriam?

754
01:17:02,984 --> 01:17:03,683
Mommy!

755
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:06,052
- Thank you. Thank you so much!
- Mommy!

756
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:09,122
- John saved me.
- Good to see you again, John.

757
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:10,624
Harold, get in there!

758
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:12,258
Find something
to put this gas in now!

759
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:14,728
Double time! Move it!

760
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:17,864
- Mommy!
- My sweet peanut!

761
01:17:17,866 --> 01:17:19,099
- Oh, baby!
- Mommy!

762
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:22,068
I thought I'd lost you.

763
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:26,206
Thank you so much
for saving her.

764
01:17:30,911 --> 01:17:33,213
Let's go! Come on!

765
01:17:33,381 --> 01:17:35,682
You two, come on!

766
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:41,855
Come on, guys, hurry up!

767
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:44,991
Let's go, move!

768
01:17:46,027 --> 01:17:48,962
One in the warehouse.
I'll go and get it.

769
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:49,763
Make it quick.

770
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:53,299
- I'm on it.
- Hurry up.

771
01:17:58,005 --> 01:18:00,040
Harold, come on!

772
01:18:02,076 --> 01:18:03,376
[growling]

773
01:18:03,378 --> 01:18:05,011
Get down!

774
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:07,180
[growling]

775
01:18:31,972 --> 01:18:35,075
John?

776
01:18:38,879 --> 01:18:41,181
John?

777
01:18:45,086 --> 01:18:46,720
Go on.

778
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,455
Get out of here.
Go without me. I'm done.

779
01:18:48,457 --> 01:18:51,991
Alex, get them out of here!

780
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:55,195
- John?
- You need to go.

781
01:18:55,197 --> 01:18:57,497
- Let me see!
- No!

782
01:18:57,499 --> 01:18:58,965
Stay up there.
It's too late.

783
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:01,468
- Come with us!
- No, I can't, sweetie.

784
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:03,369
- You need to go now.
- Please!

785
01:19:03,371 --> 01:19:06,506
Ana, put her in there. I don't
want her to see me like this.

786
01:19:06,508 --> 01:19:09,075
- Wait for me inside.
- No! John!

787
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:13,213
- Baby, listen--
- Come with us!

788
01:19:13,215 --> 01:19:15,248
Give her these.

789
01:19:16,083 --> 01:19:17,517
And, Ana...

790
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:22,255
don't let me leave the world
like one of these things.

791
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:25,125
Please.

792
01:19:37,772 --> 01:19:39,472
[gunfire]

793
01:21:20,574 --> 01:21:23,276
That was it.

794
01:21:23,878 --> 01:21:26,579
We can't go any further.

795
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:29,115
Peanut...

796
01:21:29,117 --> 01:21:31,651
I love you.

797
01:21:31,653 --> 01:21:34,053
I love you, Mommy.

798
01:21:34,922 --> 01:21:38,191
I love you, I love you.

799
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:40,093
Okay, we're gonna
have to get out,

800
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:44,430
and you need
to stay by my side.

801
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:47,000
- Okay?
- Okay.

802
01:22:04,184 --> 01:22:08,321
I'm Dr. Ana Bennett!

803
01:22:08,355 --> 01:22:13,927
In charge of the biochemical
division on base!

804
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:17,931
I'm aware of the infection!

805
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:21,000
I know what caused it!

806
01:22:21,002 --> 01:22:23,937
What should we do?

807
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:29,409
Code red is in effect.
No one can be released.

808
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:30,576
No.

809
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:33,012
I want her brought in alive.

810
01:22:33,014 --> 01:22:34,280
Who the hell are you?

811
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:37,083
U.S. General Kenneth Owens.

812
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:41,187
You have no clue what
you're dealing with here.

813
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:44,057
I'm in charge now.

814
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:47,160
Bring her in!

815
01:22:49,196 --> 01:22:52,365
Baby, come on.

816
01:22:55,369 --> 01:22:57,136
Come.

817
01:22:57,138 --> 01:23:01,040
Good girl.
Don't look down.

818
01:23:01,709 --> 01:23:03,276
Come on.

819
01:23:03,278 --> 01:23:04,677
Alex?

820
01:23:04,679 --> 01:23:07,981
No, I don't wanna die.

821
01:23:27,134 --> 01:23:32,472
- Mr. Bunny! Mr. Bunny!
- Shh! Baby!

It's okay! Shh!
