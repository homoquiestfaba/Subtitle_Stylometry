1
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:04,801
(ocean sounds)

2
00:00:07,449 --> 00:00:10,282
(bats screeching)

3
00:00:23,614 --> 00:00:26,817
(screaming in distance)

4
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:29,900
(apprehensive music)

5
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:37,834
(arguing)

6
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,911
No, no, no, no, no.

7
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:45,003
Get up here.

8
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:45,919
Please no.

9
00:00:45,919 --> 00:00:47,184
Get up here.

10
00:00:47,184 --> 00:00:48,035
(screaming)

11
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:48,868
C'mon.

12
00:00:48,868 --> 00:00:49,785
No, stop.

13
00:00:51,027 --> 00:00:51,860
Hey.

14
00:00:52,717 --> 00:00:54,958
You though you were smarter
than me, didn't you?

15
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:56,049
No, stop.

16
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:59,220
You thought you could
hide it from me, right?

17
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,187
Stop, stop, stop, stop, no, no.

18
00:01:01,187 --> 00:01:02,882
You didn't think I'd find out.

19
00:01:02,882 --> 00:01:04,580
[Girl] Let go.

20
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,952
You go ahead and scream,
scream all you want.

21
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:09,187
(screaming)

22
00:01:09,187 --> 00:01:11,467
I love the sound of screams.

23
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:13,800
(screaming)

24
00:01:16,756 --> 00:01:19,347
Screams are the music of the dead.

25
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:23,908
[Girl] It hurts, it
hurts, stop, no, no, no, no.

26
00:01:23,908 --> 00:01:26,241
(screaming)

27
00:01:31,877 --> 00:01:33,827
Did it hurt, huh?

28
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,744
That's the whole point.

29
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:39,228
It hurts, I'm innocent.

30
00:01:40,148 --> 00:01:43,089
I promise I didn't do it, I didn't do it.

31
00:01:43,089 --> 00:01:45,107
Which is it girl?

32
00:01:45,107 --> 00:01:46,976
Are you innocent or did you do it?

33
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:48,131
I didn't do it,

34
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:51,432
I didn't do it.
Both can't be true.

35
00:01:51,432 --> 00:01:52,596
What about this?

36
00:01:52,596 --> 00:01:55,307
How do you explain this, huh?

37
00:01:55,307 --> 00:01:58,678
I told you, I don't want
these things in the house.

38
00:01:58,678 --> 00:02:00,678
It's just a cellphone.

39
00:02:02,004 --> 00:02:04,337
It's the devil's earpiece.

40
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:07,794
(screaming)

41
00:02:10,275 --> 00:02:12,358
No, no, no, no, no, no.

42
00:02:16,688 --> 00:02:19,771
Dad please, please let me go, please,

43
00:02:22,825 --> 00:02:26,742
please, please, please,
please, please, please,

44
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:30,774
please, please, please, please,

45
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:40,581
please, will you let me go?

46
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:42,683
Please, please.

47
00:02:43,953 --> 00:02:46,120
(panting)

48
00:02:56,272 --> 00:02:58,992
Next time I find one
of those in your room,

49
00:02:58,992 --> 00:03:02,873
your punishment isn't gonna
be so short and sweet.

50
00:03:02,873 --> 00:03:04,206
Oh, no it won't.

51
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,567
Whatever.

52
00:03:17,869 --> 00:03:21,716
I'm faster than you are,
I'm faster than you are.

53
00:03:21,716 --> 00:03:23,966
(giggling)

54
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,541
(dramatic music)

55
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:32,104
(birds chirping)

56
00:06:45,644 --> 00:06:49,147
What was all that
caterwauling I heard downstairs?

57
00:06:49,147 --> 00:06:50,397
Nothing dear.

58
00:06:59,874 --> 00:07:02,715
You're too hard on her,
she's only a teenager.

59
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:04,798
Not hard enough, I say.

60
00:07:07,246 --> 00:07:09,246
The consommé is salty.

61
00:07:12,371 --> 00:07:15,038
Tastes fine, what's for lunch?

62
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:19,060
I believe it's lamb today.

63
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,740
One of ours or from the village?

64
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,573
One of ours, Sophia.

65
00:07:23,588 --> 00:07:25,673
And don't tell Peter, you know

66
00:07:25,673 --> 00:07:28,423
how he feels about our livestock.

67
00:07:30,765 --> 00:07:33,015
Whatever you say dearest.

68
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:39,892
(bell chiming)

69
00:07:42,991 --> 00:07:43,824
Claudia.

70
00:07:44,807 --> 00:07:45,890
Si Signora.

71
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:51,800
- No, no, no.
- No?

72
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,883
No Signora.

73
00:08:20,554 --> 00:08:22,095
Did you hear that?

74
00:08:22,095 --> 00:08:23,923
Hear what?

75
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:27,990
I could have sworn Claudia
just said something to me.

76
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,407
(grunting)

77
00:08:40,376 --> 00:08:41,626
Peter, Peter?

78
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,073
Come, come join us.

79
00:08:59,052 --> 00:08:59,885
Mangia.

80
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,809
Tasty lamb, isn't it Peter?

81
00:09:25,975 --> 00:09:28,776
Sophia always looked
kind of scrawny to me.

82
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,598
Never thought she had
much meat on her but,

83
00:09:31,598 --> 00:09:33,098
guess I was wrong.

84
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:35,958
She's damn delicious.

85
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,946
Oh, I forgot.
(crying)

86
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:39,890
[Lisbeth] Carver.

87
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,169
I wasn't supposed to say anything.

88
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:43,586
Carver, really?

89
00:09:46,882 --> 00:09:51,049
It's okay, Peter, it's
okay, it's okay, it's okay.

90
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,185
Sophia va, Sophia.

91
00:09:56,185 --> 00:09:58,102
See what you're done?

92
00:09:59,514 --> 00:10:02,665
He's a grown man, he should act like it.

93
00:10:02,665 --> 00:10:04,967
Grow up, you hear me?

94
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:06,579
(crying)

95
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:08,335
Is that any way to treat your bother?

96
00:10:08,335 --> 00:10:09,585
Half-brother.

97
00:10:11,171 --> 00:10:15,338
That damn village mother
of his made him so stupid.

98
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:19,891
And where the hell's
that daughter of ours?

99
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:22,789
Lunchtime is supposed to be for family.

100
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,289
Naomi, get the hell down here.

101
00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:35,452
(apprehensive music)

102
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,297
(wailing)

103
00:10:51,044 --> 00:10:54,127
Aw, uncle Peter, what's wrong, huh?

104
00:10:56,524 --> 00:11:00,691
You're late, I told you
to be on time for meals.

105
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:02,954
Yes, sorry dad.

106
00:11:07,011 --> 00:11:11,094
Maybe what you need is
another trip downstairs.

107
00:11:16,587 --> 00:11:18,977
What's wrong with uncle Peter?

108
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:20,827
Your father did the
injustice of telling him that

109
00:11:20,827 --> 00:11:23,406
we're having Sophia for lunch.

110
00:11:23,406 --> 00:11:26,119
Sophia (sobbing)

111
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:29,536
Oh no, Sophia was one of his favorites.

112
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:35,441
Now she's my favorite (chuckling)

113
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:39,444
I'm sorry.

114
00:11:42,086 --> 00:11:43,003
Here, woof?

115
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,196
You've got other lambs.

116
00:12:17,162 --> 00:12:19,495
(sobbing)

117
00:12:27,891 --> 00:12:29,558
Sorry uncle Peter.

118
00:12:31,123 --> 00:12:33,040
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

119
00:12:43,508 --> 00:12:44,341
I'm sorry.

120
00:12:50,193 --> 00:12:51,026
Claudia.

121
00:12:51,026 --> 00:12:53,276
(clanking)

122
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:56,692
Si Signora.

123
00:12:58,117 --> 00:13:01,629
Can you get uncle Peter a hanger please?

124
00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:03,455
Of course Signora.

125
00:13:03,455 --> 00:13:06,429
And Claudia, make sure that the meat

126
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:08,834
is not from one of ours.

127
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:09,667
Sure.

128
00:13:11,627 --> 00:13:15,794
Hey bring him some veal. (Chuckling)

129
00:13:24,235 --> 00:13:27,402
(blowing raspberries)

130
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,080
Father?

131
00:14:10,912 --> 00:14:14,336
I though you might like something to eat.

132
00:14:14,336 --> 00:14:17,586
Only if you're feeling up to it though.

133
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,966
That's fine, I'll just leave it there.

134
00:14:24,506 --> 00:14:25,839
Edgar Allan Poe?

135
00:14:27,356 --> 00:14:29,689
Of course, I'd be delighted.

136
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:37,524
"From childhood's hour I have not been"

137
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,087
"As others were I have not seen"

138
00:14:43,643 --> 00:14:46,393
"As others saw I could not bring"

139
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:52,086
"My passions from a common spring"

140
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,541
"From the same source I have not taken"

141
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:02,984
"My sorrow I could not awaken"

142
00:15:04,226 --> 00:15:07,059
"My heart to joy at the same tone"

143
00:15:10,337 --> 00:15:13,004
"And all I lov'd, I lov'd alone"

144
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:20,221
"Then, in my childhood in the dawn"

145
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,798
"Of a stormy life was drawn"

146
00:15:28,835 --> 00:15:31,668
"From ev'ry depth of good and ill"

147
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:39,308
"The mystery that binds me still."

148
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:47,100
(pitter-patter)

149
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:50,294
Father, do you hear that?

150
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:56,316
Your guardian angels,
they're sent to protect you.

151
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,773
(pop music)

152
00:16:22,183 --> 00:16:24,433
(knocking)

153
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:36,623
[Lisbeth] Naomi? Are you awake?

154
00:16:48,111 --> 00:16:49,778
I'm just thinking.

155
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:54,819
What are you thinking about?

156
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,930
A lot of things.

157
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,062
Like what?

158
00:17:10,482 --> 00:17:13,065
Like, maybe going to college.

159
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,338
College?

160
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:23,052
Yeah.

161
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,339
Don't be ridiculous.

162
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,339
Mom, I'm 18 years old.

163
00:17:32,362 --> 00:17:34,612
I'm smart enough, aren't I?

164
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,478
I wanna go to college.

165
00:17:39,478 --> 00:17:42,684
Baby I know how old you are,
and yes, you're smart enough,

166
00:17:42,684 --> 00:17:45,493
of course you're smart enough,
but that's not the point.

167
00:17:45,493 --> 00:17:47,767
You don't have to go to
college to get an education,

168
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:51,250
you can get an education right here.

169
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,108
I'll bring in teachers, we can get tutors.

170
00:17:53,108 --> 00:17:55,641
That's not my point, okay?

171
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,525
I wanna go out and I wanna see the world,

172
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:00,525
and I wanna meet people.

173
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,850
It's not like you don't have the money.

174
00:18:06,134 --> 00:18:10,301
You can send me to any
college that you wanted to.

175
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,798
I don't think that's a very good idea.

176
00:18:17,693 --> 00:18:20,382
Not a good idea for me or for you?

177
00:18:20,382 --> 00:18:23,404
What's that supposed to mean?

178
00:18:23,404 --> 00:18:28,030
I think that you want
to keep me here forever.

179
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,326
You don't wanna stay here?

180
00:18:29,326 --> 00:18:32,076
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

181
00:18:38,205 --> 00:18:41,788
I just wanna go out
and I wanna see people.

182
00:18:44,283 --> 00:18:46,670
Yeah but people are just trouble.

183
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,253
They are, they're just trouble.

184
00:18:50,277 --> 00:18:54,444
What's wrong with a little
trouble every now and then?

185
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,682
You're so much like
your grandmother, you are.

186
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,432
You're so, you're full of spirit.

187
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:12,820
Don't be sad mom.

188
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,718
You know, when I was a little girl,

189
00:19:16,718 --> 00:19:18,887
the circus came to the village,

190
00:19:18,887 --> 00:19:23,054
and your grandma, she was
obsessed, she was captivated,

191
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,647
absolutely captivated, it was amazing.

192
00:19:29,723 --> 00:19:32,411
So amazing and so
captivated that she ran away

193
00:19:32,411 --> 00:19:34,710
and never came back.

194
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,184
Yeah?

195
00:19:36,184 --> 00:19:40,351
When I was a teenager,
the circus came back through

196
00:19:41,937 --> 00:19:45,354
and your grandma, she was on the trapeze.

197
00:19:47,824 --> 00:19:50,818
(chuckling)

198
00:19:50,818 --> 00:19:54,985
It was amazing, she was
flying around, it was magic.

199
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,197
She never came back.

200
00:20:04,942 --> 00:20:06,942
Did you say hi to her?

201
00:20:09,664 --> 00:20:12,081
But why didn't she come back?

202
00:20:14,457 --> 00:20:15,707
I don't know.

203
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:20,313
Is that why I never met her?

204
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,653
Your grandpa and I, we were so sad.

205
00:20:28,641 --> 00:20:32,808
Just like your father and I
would be so sad if you left.

206
00:20:35,178 --> 00:20:37,178
But I would come back.

207
00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:40,942
You wouldn't come back.

208
00:20:53,327 --> 00:20:54,160
What?

209
00:20:59,988 --> 00:21:01,238
What is this?

210
00:21:04,818 --> 00:21:06,611
Just my iPod.

211
00:21:06,611 --> 00:21:07,619
An iPod?

212
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:08,975
[Naomi] Yeah.

213
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:11,348
And where did you get an iPod?

214
00:21:11,348 --> 00:21:12,820
The village.

215
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,653
The village?

216
00:21:13,653 --> 00:21:15,049
When did you go to the village?

217
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:17,882
Mom, I didn't go to the village.

218
00:21:20,171 --> 00:21:22,680
Then how did you get it?

219
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,527
I got it from one of the
delivery boys when they came here

220
00:21:25,527 --> 00:21:27,322
A boy gave it to you?

221
00:21:27,322 --> 00:21:28,822
It's just music.

222
00:21:31,268 --> 00:21:32,518
Please, listen.

223
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,756
(pop music)

224
00:21:36,756 --> 00:21:40,081
Okay, you know what,
that's just racket for me.

225
00:21:40,081 --> 00:21:42,785
It is, we have music
right here at the castle.

226
00:21:42,785 --> 00:21:46,775
Yeah, it's wonderful if
you like funeral music.

227
00:21:46,775 --> 00:21:48,358
This music's alive.

228
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:51,675
It has a pulse, I love it.

229
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:04,414
You know what?

230
00:22:04,414 --> 00:22:07,733
You better not let your father
catch you with that thing.

231
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:11,585
I mean it, it'll be
downstairs again for you.

232
00:22:11,585 --> 00:22:13,467
Dad needs to chill.

233
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:15,217
Dad needs to chill?

234
00:22:16,121 --> 00:22:17,288
What is chill?

235
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:20,498
It means relax.

236
00:22:20,498 --> 00:22:21,570
It means relax?

237
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,380
[Naomi] Yeah, they've
been using it for years...

238
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,132
Well, I don't care, I don't like it.

239
00:22:25,132 --> 00:22:27,499
I don't like it, it's undignified.

240
00:22:27,499 --> 00:22:29,166
You know what Naomi?

241
00:22:30,425 --> 00:22:33,882
As Arkoffs, we do things
our own way, okay?

242
00:22:33,882 --> 00:22:35,766
Some people think we're different,

243
00:22:35,766 --> 00:22:39,099
I would like to think that we're unique.

244
00:22:40,172 --> 00:22:42,422
Unique rhymes with freak.

245
00:22:49,531 --> 00:22:52,281
(dramatic music)

246
00:23:21,014 --> 00:23:23,264
(knocking)

247
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,864
Yes?

248
00:23:30,864 --> 00:23:33,458
Good morning, is the man
or woman of the house in?

249
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:36,459
I am sorry, we do not accept visitors.

250
00:23:36,459 --> 00:23:38,293
I apologize that we didn't call first,

251
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:39,974
but I couldn't find your phone number.

252
00:23:39,974 --> 00:23:40,807
No phone.

253
00:23:40,807 --> 00:23:42,108
I see, well it's very...

254
00:23:42,108 --> 00:23:44,441
[Claudia] No, no visitors.

255
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,364
[Woman] It's very important...

256
00:24:06,364 --> 00:24:07,531
No visitors.

257
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:19,341
Hey hey, I'm Naomi, I'm Naomi.

258
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:21,881
- Oh hi Naomi.
- Come in, come in.

259
00:24:21,881 --> 00:24:23,154
Alright thanks.

260
00:24:23,154 --> 00:24:24,237
Ma Signora.

261
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:26,416
[Naomi] Come.

262
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,841
I'm Kimi Evans, my
associates and I have been

263
00:24:40,841 --> 00:24:45,225
staying in Rome and we're very
interested in your castle.

264
00:24:45,225 --> 00:24:46,642
It's magnificent.

265
00:24:47,537 --> 00:24:49,172
You see, I'm a producer and I...

266
00:24:49,172 --> 00:24:50,729
A producer?

267
00:24:50,729 --> 00:24:53,756
Yes, movie producer from Los Angeles.

268
00:24:53,756 --> 00:24:54,923
Los Angeles?

269
00:24:55,982 --> 00:24:58,312
You mean like Hollywood?

270
00:24:58,312 --> 00:25:00,987
The same, this is our
producer here in Italy,

271
00:25:00,987 --> 00:25:04,572
L.J. Rambouli, and this is
our director, Jensen Curry.

272
00:25:04,572 --> 00:25:06,989
It's very nice to meet you.

273
00:25:12,602 --> 00:25:15,045
This will be Jensen's first
feature and we're pretty

274
00:25:15,045 --> 00:25:17,675
excited about it, aren't we L.J.?

275
00:25:17,675 --> 00:25:19,759
Yeah, it's very excited.

276
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:22,026
Jensen's on a lot of
music videos, Green Day,

277
00:25:22,026 --> 00:25:24,392
the Jonas Brothers, 50 Cent.

278
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:25,225
Really?

279
00:25:32,326 --> 00:25:33,409
I like music.

280
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:35,700
Me too.

281
00:25:38,482 --> 00:25:42,118
Naomi, is your mother or father home?

282
00:25:42,118 --> 00:25:44,368
They're around someplace.

283
00:25:45,403 --> 00:25:49,570
You can go ahead and tell
me, 'cause I'm old enough.

284
00:25:50,526 --> 00:25:52,952
Okay, well like I say,
we're producing a new movie,

285
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:56,117
set here in Italy and we've
been scouting locations.

286
00:25:56,117 --> 00:25:58,888
L.J. hears about your castle
from some of the villagers

287
00:25:58,888 --> 00:26:02,522
and we think it would make a great set.

288
00:26:02,522 --> 00:26:05,588
You mean like shooting a movie here?

289
00:26:05,588 --> 00:26:07,196
Well, yes part of it, you see it's...

290
00:26:07,196 --> 00:26:10,357
You see, it's a World
War Two spy thriller.

291
00:26:10,357 --> 00:26:13,344
Now our hero gets dropped
behind enemy lines on a plot

292
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:16,507
to kill Mussolini, and
posing as a village baker,

293
00:26:16,507 --> 00:26:19,628
he sneaks into the dictators
kitchen in order to carry out...

294
00:26:19,628 --> 00:26:22,378
Oh that sounds damned exciting.

295
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:30,340
We don't care much for movies around here.

296
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,173
Dad.

297
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:36,333
You're Mr. Arkoff, we wanted
to meet you, I'm Kimi Evans.

298
00:26:39,517 --> 00:26:41,604
My daughter has gotten
a little ahead of herself

299
00:26:41,604 --> 00:26:44,190
and forgotten the family rules.

300
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,482
We don't take to strangers.

301
00:26:46,482 --> 00:26:48,721
I am sorry that we
didn't call first, but,

302
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:51,766
like I told Naomi, we couldn't
find your phone number.

303
00:26:51,766 --> 00:26:55,866
Apology accepted, now you
can all turn around and go.

304
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:58,065
Dad, just listen to
what they have to say.

305
00:26:58,065 --> 00:26:59,823
I have heard enough.

306
00:26:59,823 --> 00:27:02,143
[Naomi] They wanna make
a World War Two movie.

307
00:27:02,143 --> 00:27:04,643
Yeah about a baker, I heard.

308
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:08,687
But we don't want any movies shot here.

309
00:27:08,687 --> 00:27:10,696
I don't need a bunch of
people stomping around

310
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:12,827
and leaving their garbage everywhere.

311
00:27:12,827 --> 00:27:14,539
I assure you, we'll
leave the castle ground

312
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:16,617
in immaculate condition.

313
00:27:16,617 --> 00:27:20,752
The castle grounds are exactly
the way I want them to be,

314
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:23,287
so thanks anyway, but no thanks.

315
00:27:23,287 --> 00:27:25,550
There would be a
considerable cash compensation

316
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,468
for you and your family.

317
00:27:27,468 --> 00:27:29,236
We don't need your money.

318
00:27:29,236 --> 00:27:30,774
Now I'm sure you can all find your way

319
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,774
down the hill from here.

320
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,806
There's a little hotel down there.

321
00:27:35,806 --> 00:27:38,096
It's not up to your standards, I'm sure,

322
00:27:38,096 --> 00:27:40,365
but at least they have beds.

323
00:27:40,365 --> 00:27:42,252
Sir, maybe if you heard just a little...

324
00:27:42,252 --> 00:27:45,085
Peter will show you to the door.

325
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:49,036
Door, this direction.

326
00:27:51,282 --> 00:27:54,350
Well okay then, if you change your mind,

327
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:58,433
this has my cell number
on it, you can call any...

328
00:28:08,944 --> 00:28:12,361
Why did you have to be so mean to them?

329
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,262
You're so embarrassing.

330
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:19,512
Don't you talk to me that way, Naomi.

331
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:28,830
(apprehensive music)

332
00:28:46,515 --> 00:28:49,598
(apprehensive music)

333
00:29:40,926 --> 00:29:43,009
Grandpa, are you awake?

334
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:52,210
Do you want me to read to you?

335
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:57,564
I know you're probably
surprised I'm asking.

336
00:29:57,564 --> 00:29:58,397
Okay.

337
00:30:03,585 --> 00:30:05,585
You dropped your cookie.

338
00:30:09,882 --> 00:30:10,882
Hey grandpa?

339
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:16,369
I know how you are about having strangers,

340
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:18,622
but it just seems that mom
and dad just wanna keep me

341
00:30:18,622 --> 00:30:21,463
here forever, and when
you were young didn't you

342
00:30:21,463 --> 00:30:24,463
wanna go out and just see the world?

343
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:29,350
Now these people are from Hollywood,

344
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:32,683
and one of them, Jensen, he was so nice.

345
00:30:34,192 --> 00:30:37,192
Don't tell mom that I told you that.

346
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,379
I don't wanna be here forever,

347
00:30:45,478 --> 00:30:48,228
and one day you're gonna be gone,

348
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:53,565
mom's gonna be gone, dad's gonna be gone.

349
00:30:55,508 --> 00:30:57,841
Who's gonna be there for me?

350
00:31:04,472 --> 00:31:05,305
Grandpa?

351
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:13,668
Can you please just talk to
mom and dad and just, please?

352
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:22,376
Pretty please just at least
have them stay for dinner?

353
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:25,933
If you do I promise I will
read to you every day,

354
00:31:25,933 --> 00:31:28,619
I'll do anything you want.

355
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:29,952
Grandpa, please.

356
00:31:35,858 --> 00:31:38,108
Please just think about it.

357
00:31:41,577 --> 00:31:42,494
I love you.

358
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:02,210
(apprehensive music)

359
00:32:24,155 --> 00:32:25,545
(knocking)

360
00:32:25,545 --> 00:32:27,229
I got it Claudia.

361
00:32:27,229 --> 00:32:28,062
Okay.

362
00:32:32,803 --> 00:32:33,636
Ciao.

363
00:32:53,127 --> 00:32:55,960
Hey, hey can I use your cellphone?

364
00:32:57,541 --> 00:32:59,124
Thanks you, grazie.

365
00:33:31,657 --> 00:33:33,824
(humming)

366
00:34:07,365 --> 00:34:09,365
Here you go little guys.

367
00:35:01,137 --> 00:35:03,970
Hey Jensen, you look so beautiful.

368
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,127
I like it when you touch me like that.

369
00:35:59,189 --> 00:36:01,689
(piano music)

370
00:36:06,649 --> 00:36:08,566
Very nice, bravo Peter.

371
00:36:26,815 --> 00:36:29,676
(knocking)

372
00:36:29,676 --> 00:36:31,926
Ah yes, Claudia I got it.

373
00:36:33,588 --> 00:36:34,838
Okay okay, yes.

374
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,556
Come in, so glad that you could make it.

375
00:37:16,556 --> 00:37:18,362
[Kimi] Thank you.

376
00:37:18,362 --> 00:37:20,437
[Jensen] I'm really glad you called us.

377
00:37:20,437 --> 00:37:23,317
It's just so great that you're here.

378
00:37:23,317 --> 00:37:25,285
We were surprised to get
the call, especially after

379
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,230
the way your father kicked us out of here.

380
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,424
Oh don't mind him, he needs to chill.

381
00:37:29,424 --> 00:37:31,424
Come on, right this way.

382
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:46,270
(piano music)

383
00:37:52,866 --> 00:37:55,668
Wow, everything looks so nice Naomi.

384
00:37:55,668 --> 00:37:58,826
Thank you, Claudia is
fixing you something special,

385
00:37:58,826 --> 00:38:01,615
I hope you like it, come on.

386
00:38:01,615 --> 00:38:03,354
I'm sure we'll love it.

387
00:38:03,354 --> 00:38:06,521
Miss Evans, you sit here, you there.

388
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,079
Mr. Curry, you sit here, next to me.

389
00:38:14,066 --> 00:38:16,347
Just call me Jensen, please.

390
00:38:16,347 --> 00:38:17,597
Okay, Jensen.

391
00:38:28,304 --> 00:38:31,387
(apprehensive music)

392
00:38:32,674 --> 00:38:34,839
What the devil's going on?

393
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:36,638
We are having guests for dinner daddy.

394
00:38:36,638 --> 00:38:39,555
I can see that, who invited them?

395
00:38:40,715 --> 00:38:42,662
If there's a problem we can leave.

396
00:38:42,662 --> 00:38:44,154
Everything is cool.

397
00:38:44,154 --> 00:38:46,154
Everything's not cool.

398
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:52,127
Carver don't be ridiculous,
these are our guests.

399
00:38:52,127 --> 00:38:54,306
Sweetheart, the table looks beautiful.

400
00:38:54,306 --> 00:38:56,601
Oh, thanks mom, I love you.

401
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:57,947
You knew about this?

402
00:38:57,947 --> 00:39:01,383
Of course I did, who do
you think invited them?

403
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:04,050
Daddy, why don't you sit down?

404
00:39:05,275 --> 00:39:07,858
Claudia's fixing your favorite.

405
00:39:10,038 --> 00:39:13,310
I told you, nothing good
can come from outsiders.

406
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,546
Dad, we're the outsiders.

407
00:39:15,546 --> 00:39:17,534
Don't you backtalk me girl.

408
00:39:17,534 --> 00:39:19,841
Not in front of company.

409
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:20,674
Sorry.

410
00:39:21,749 --> 00:39:24,028
What's that you're wearing?

411
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,708
Looks like your showing
a lot of skin to me.

412
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:28,195
Waiting for the fleet to come in.

413
00:39:28,195 --> 00:39:31,612
Carver, be quiet, you're being foolish.

414
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:36,914
(upbeat piano music)

415
00:39:42,868 --> 00:39:43,701
Peter.

416
00:39:46,435 --> 00:39:49,185
(dramatic music)

417
00:39:57,259 --> 00:39:59,961
She's three hours late for recall time,

418
00:39:59,961 --> 00:40:02,788
she finally shows up at the
studio with her whole posse

419
00:40:02,788 --> 00:40:06,955
like 20 people, she spends
an hour in hair and makeup,

420
00:40:07,802 --> 00:40:11,440
then rips the head off of
some poor PA because her water

421
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,607
was too cold, she shows up
on set, she does one take

422
00:40:16,474 --> 00:40:18,029
and then leaves.

423
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:20,763
I had no choice but to use them.

424
00:40:20,763 --> 00:40:25,348
Hollywood sounds so
exciting, doesn't it daddy?

425
00:40:25,348 --> 00:40:28,724
Bunch of spoiled
sissies, overpaid babies,

426
00:40:28,724 --> 00:40:30,805
none of them worth a flying fuck.

427
00:40:30,805 --> 00:40:33,818
Oh Carver, don't be obstreperous.

428
00:40:33,818 --> 00:40:36,901
I'm sure the business has its charms.

429
00:40:39,265 --> 00:40:41,770
You don't look like a producer to me L.J.

430
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:44,484
As far as I know,
producers sit behind desks

431
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:46,809
and make phone calls to lackeys.

432
00:40:46,809 --> 00:40:50,596
You however, you look like a
man that's has his fair share

433
00:40:50,596 --> 00:40:52,263
of hard honest work.

434
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,690
You think so?

435
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:02,676
Um, Mr. Arkoff, I'm sure
we can work something out

436
00:41:02,676 --> 00:41:06,201
to your satisfaction, I mean
in terms or a rental fee

437
00:41:06,201 --> 00:41:08,320
for your property, you
just name your terms

438
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,517
and I'll have our lawyers
write up a contract.

439
00:41:10,517 --> 00:41:13,580
Told you before, no
movie is shooting here.

440
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,913
Come on daddy.

441
00:41:16,042 --> 00:41:18,120
Don't start with me again girl,

442
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,930
or you're gonna take
another trip downstairs.

443
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:24,007
(distant hooting)

444
00:41:24,007 --> 00:41:25,412
What's that?

445
00:41:25,412 --> 00:41:28,347
Those are the protectors.

446
00:41:28,347 --> 00:41:31,276
They protect the castle from evil.

447
00:41:31,276 --> 00:41:32,943
Nothing but pests.

448
00:41:35,492 --> 00:41:40,322
Daddy, grandpa says they're
been around for 200 years.

449
00:41:40,322 --> 00:41:43,931
Your grandpa is disturbed in the head.

450
00:41:43,931 --> 00:41:45,884
The protectors?

451
00:41:45,884 --> 00:41:49,884
An old Italian legend
referring to elementals.

452
00:41:51,131 --> 00:41:53,381
Some call them skull heads.

453
00:41:54,771 --> 00:41:56,890
You see, the Romans
used to bury their dead

454
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,612
in underground catacombs.

455
00:41:59,612 --> 00:42:01,964
We were told that there
might actually be tombs

456
00:42:01,964 --> 00:42:04,368
somewhere under this castle.

457
00:42:04,368 --> 00:42:06,597
Isn't that cool?

458
00:42:06,597 --> 00:42:09,116
When the Ostrogoths
and Vandals sacked Rome

459
00:42:09,116 --> 00:42:13,475
they violated the catacombs
searching for valuables.

460
00:42:13,475 --> 00:42:18,403
The skull heads are creatures
born from witchcraft

461
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:20,209
and they were put here to protect the dead

462
00:42:20,209 --> 00:42:22,723
from just such violation.

463
00:42:22,723 --> 00:42:24,605
Don't worry, they only show themselves

464
00:42:24,605 --> 00:42:26,688
to the face of true evil.

465
00:42:27,683 --> 00:42:30,523
It's said that they have
the power to bring life

466
00:42:30,523 --> 00:42:34,690
and to take it, to bring the
dead back from the grave.

467
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:39,292
It's amazing, huh?

468
00:42:41,874 --> 00:42:44,983
I'm sure there's a
lot of interesting stuff

469
00:42:44,983 --> 00:42:47,623
about this castle, huh?

470
00:42:47,623 --> 00:42:49,628
I'm sure there are, I don't suppose we

471
00:42:49,628 --> 00:42:51,890
could have a quick tour?

472
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:54,557
Yes, I would love to take you.

473
00:42:55,845 --> 00:42:59,062
I mean, if that's okay
with you, Mr. Arkoff?

474
00:42:59,062 --> 00:43:01,308
If we can't shoot our film here, maybe

475
00:43:01,308 --> 00:43:03,990
a tour would give Jensen some ideas?

476
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:05,423
We could replicate certain rooms

477
00:43:05,423 --> 00:43:07,734
on the sound stage if we need to.

478
00:43:07,734 --> 00:43:10,421
Please daddy, please,
please, please, please,

479
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,183
please daddy, please, please,
please, pretty, pretty,

480
00:43:13,183 --> 00:43:15,607
pretty, pretty, pretty please, please...

481
00:43:15,607 --> 00:43:17,357
Aw hell, I suppose.

482
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,796
Thank you.

483
00:43:21,796 --> 00:43:23,839
This doesn't get you off the hook.

484
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,089
You're still due for a trip downstairs.

485
00:43:26,089 --> 00:43:27,422
Okay, come on.

486
00:43:29,647 --> 00:43:31,683
It was a lovely meal Mrs. Arkoff.

487
00:43:31,683 --> 00:43:33,683
The risotto was lumpy.

488
00:43:47,641 --> 00:43:49,974
Peter, keep an eye on 'em.

489
00:44:00,265 --> 00:44:01,098
Claudia?

490
00:44:01,098 --> 00:44:02,030
Yes?

491
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,593
The risotto was lumpy.

492
00:44:03,593 --> 00:44:05,585
It was unacceptable this evening.

493
00:44:05,585 --> 00:44:08,502
(speaks Italian)

494
00:44:15,215 --> 00:44:19,382
That woman, I swear I
don't know why you hired her.

495
00:44:20,635 --> 00:44:23,635
What was it you called me earlier?

496
00:44:25,667 --> 00:44:29,417
Obste, obsetri, aba,
obste, obstetri, obste...

497
00:44:35,116 --> 00:44:36,366
Obstreperous.

498
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:42,079
Oh yeah, I love it when
you use big words huh?

499
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,827
I know, I know.

500
00:44:43,827 --> 00:44:45,244
Such a turn-on.

501
00:44:48,164 --> 00:44:50,914
(dramatic music)

502
00:45:02,358 --> 00:45:04,826
[Jensen] Wow, the architecture
of this place is amazing.

503
00:45:04,826 --> 00:45:05,659
Really?

504
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:11,807
I've lived here my whole
life, so have mom and dad.

505
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:14,791
So your family's
always owned the castle?

506
00:45:14,791 --> 00:45:18,431
No my great-great-grandfather
was in one of those wars,

507
00:45:18,431 --> 00:45:22,022
over 100 years ago, the
Spanish-American war I think it was,

508
00:45:22,022 --> 00:45:23,035
and he wanted to stay here

509
00:45:23,035 --> 00:45:25,583
and won this castle in a card game.

510
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:26,452
Really?

511
00:45:26,452 --> 00:45:29,609
Yeah, that's why we speak English.

512
00:45:29,609 --> 00:45:33,707
'Cause he didn't want us to
forget where we came from.

513
00:45:33,707 --> 00:45:37,207
Grandpa's upstairs, he has to stay in bed.

514
00:45:38,462 --> 00:45:41,718
I'm sorry, is he an invalid?

515
00:45:41,718 --> 00:45:43,385
No, he's American.

516
00:45:56,708 --> 00:46:01,636
So these protectors, the
ones your mom was calling

517
00:46:01,636 --> 00:46:02,852
the skull heads.

518
00:46:02,852 --> 00:46:04,383
Yeah.

519
00:46:04,383 --> 00:46:07,252
Have you ever seen them?

520
00:46:07,252 --> 00:46:08,669
They're around.

521
00:46:09,864 --> 00:46:13,281
What like guardian angels or something?

522
00:46:14,752 --> 00:46:18,002
So, do you want to go to the dungeon?

523
00:46:18,856 --> 00:46:21,270
You really have a dungeon?

524
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,020
Of course, come on.

525
00:46:46,675 --> 00:46:48,342
This is the dungeon.

526
00:46:51,153 --> 00:46:55,062
Do you think it'll be cool in the movie?

527
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:58,638
I really hope my dad lets you film here.

528
00:46:58,638 --> 00:47:01,267
It would be so much fun.

529
00:47:01,267 --> 00:47:04,238
The door is a great
help, more than you know.

530
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,405
(giggles)

531
00:47:07,669 --> 00:47:09,836
Where did all these things come from?

532
00:47:09,836 --> 00:47:13,443
I think from the Spanish
inc or something like that.

533
00:47:13,443 --> 00:47:15,262
You mean inquisition?

534
00:47:15,262 --> 00:47:19,508
[Naomi] Yeah, mom said
it was happening in Italy.

535
00:47:19,508 --> 00:47:21,718
I guess it was happening all over.

536
00:47:21,718 --> 00:47:24,442
[Jensen] People being tortured
for their religious beliefs

537
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:26,442
Yeah, it's gnarly huh?

538
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,093
Wicked.

539
00:47:39,515 --> 00:47:42,396
This was one of daddy's favorites.

540
00:47:42,396 --> 00:47:43,726
His favorite?

541
00:47:43,726 --> 00:47:48,028
Uh-huh, he uses it
on me when I misbehave.

542
00:47:48,028 --> 00:47:49,429
Wait a minute, you
mean your dad actually

543
00:47:49,429 --> 00:47:51,298
puts you in this thing?

544
00:47:51,298 --> 00:47:54,881
Yeah, he's just doing
what's best for me.

545
00:47:55,778 --> 00:47:57,810
That's sadistic.

546
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:01,081
It's really, it's not that bad.

547
00:48:01,081 --> 00:48:03,815
Naomi, you can't let him do that to you.

548
00:48:03,815 --> 00:48:05,729
It's not that bad really.

549
00:48:05,729 --> 00:48:07,977
But it's not right.

550
00:48:07,977 --> 00:48:11,310
Look, you shouldn't be treated that way.

551
00:48:14,376 --> 00:48:17,126
(dramatic music)

552
00:48:31,086 --> 00:48:33,519
(buzzing)

553
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:34,436
What the?

554
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:37,503
The guardian angels.

555
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,783
Smells like fumo.

556
00:48:50,016 --> 00:48:51,766
Visit time is over.

557
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:57,640
Aw, we're ready uncle Peter.

558
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,406
I'm glad you invited us today.

559
00:49:00,406 --> 00:49:01,823
Me too, really.

560
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:20,453
(apprehensive music)

561
00:49:33,483 --> 00:49:34,589
It could work?

562
00:49:34,589 --> 00:49:35,803
It's perfect.

563
00:49:35,803 --> 00:49:37,471
You see what they keep in there?

564
00:49:37,471 --> 00:49:40,521
They don't even know, to
them it's just old junk.

565
00:49:40,521 --> 00:49:44,083
The paintings, the tapestries,
the pottery alone is worth

566
00:49:44,083 --> 00:49:45,916
at least 300 thousand.

567
00:49:46,868 --> 00:49:48,075
Can we move it?

568
00:49:48,075 --> 00:49:50,743
I know a fance In Rome who
can get it off our hands.

569
00:49:50,743 --> 00:49:51,928
What's his percentage?

570
00:49:51,928 --> 00:49:55,051
Not too bad, but he can
unload it to collectors

571
00:49:55,051 --> 00:49:57,834
much faster than we ever could.

572
00:49:57,834 --> 00:49:58,989
When do we go in?

573
00:49:58,989 --> 00:50:02,077
What's wrong with tomorrow night?

574
00:50:02,077 --> 00:50:05,124
Okay, but nobody gets hurt.

575
00:50:05,124 --> 00:50:06,345
Don't tell me you have a soft spot

576
00:50:06,345 --> 00:50:08,274
for that little piece of pie in there.

577
00:50:08,274 --> 00:50:11,331
Look, we can get in and
out without anyone seeing us.

578
00:50:11,331 --> 00:50:13,562
There's not gonna be
a reason to hurt them.

579
00:50:13,562 --> 00:50:14,616
But if they see us...

580
00:50:14,616 --> 00:50:16,053
They won't see us.

581
00:50:16,053 --> 00:50:17,219
But if they do and
you don't have the guts

582
00:50:17,219 --> 00:50:20,552
to do what needs to be done, I'll do it.

583
00:50:36,602 --> 00:50:38,569
Good morning Signora.

584
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:41,630
Yes, it is a good morning, isn't it?

585
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:44,494
Oh yeah, your breakfast is ready.

586
00:50:44,494 --> 00:50:46,702
Thanks you so much Claudia.

587
00:50:46,702 --> 00:50:48,535
Mmm, it looks so good.

588
00:50:51,212 --> 00:50:52,736
Hey Claudia?

589
00:50:52,736 --> 00:50:53,569
Yes?

590
00:50:53,569 --> 00:50:57,069
Did you see that guy last night, Jensen?

591
00:50:59,281 --> 00:51:01,448
Ah, he's so nice isn't he?

592
00:51:02,714 --> 00:51:05,047
(chuckling)

593
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:15,499
(pop music)

594
00:51:17,858 --> 00:51:21,025
Eat up girl, eat all your breakfast.

595
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:27,536
No, no, no, no.

596
00:51:31,108 --> 00:51:35,034
That breakfast is the only
food you're gonna get today.

597
00:51:35,034 --> 00:51:36,738
You're going downstairs and you know

598
00:51:36,738 --> 00:51:39,071
there's no meals down there.

599
00:51:40,062 --> 00:51:41,472
Because of an iPod?

600
00:51:41,472 --> 00:51:43,428
Because you let strangers into the house

601
00:51:43,428 --> 00:51:45,345
when I told you not to.

602
00:51:46,221 --> 00:51:48,417
They were nice.

603
00:51:48,417 --> 00:51:52,551
Nothing good can come from
strangers, I told you that.

604
00:51:52,551 --> 00:51:54,108
Mom said it was okay.

605
00:51:54,108 --> 00:51:56,062
Your mamma thinks it's okay to put out

606
00:51:56,062 --> 00:51:58,610
cookies for the leprechauns.

607
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:02,693
It's what I say that
counts, don't you forget it.

608
00:52:06,192 --> 00:52:10,789
Eat your fill, 'cause
you're going downstairs.

609
00:52:10,789 --> 00:52:13,789
(crying, screaming)

610
00:52:21,184 --> 00:52:22,267
I hate you.

611
00:52:33,842 --> 00:52:34,675
Peter.

612
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:44,754
Peter, (yelling in Italian)

613
00:52:49,843 --> 00:52:52,260
You animal, get off of her.

614
00:52:54,078 --> 00:52:55,328
Get off of her.

615
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:59,805
She's not here to
pleasure your puny pecker.

616
00:52:59,805 --> 00:53:02,341
Get out of here, make yourself useful.

617
00:53:02,341 --> 00:53:05,508
Go to the pull and fuck the livestock.

618
00:53:09,505 --> 00:53:10,764
Dummy.

619
00:53:10,764 --> 00:53:13,389
Thank you Mr. Arkoff.

620
00:53:13,389 --> 00:53:16,121
Where do you think you're going?

621
00:53:16,121 --> 00:53:18,871
(dramatic music)

622
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,563
There's still a couple of lights on.

623
00:53:34,563 --> 00:53:38,153
Maybe they keep some on, but
they must be in bed by now.

624
00:53:38,153 --> 00:53:40,313
That family of weirdos, who knows?

625
00:53:40,313 --> 00:53:42,796
Maybe they stay up all
night like vampires.

626
00:53:42,796 --> 00:53:44,469
Alright look, I want
you guys to promise me

627
00:53:44,469 --> 00:53:47,407
that when we get in there
we're not gonna hurt anyone.

628
00:53:47,407 --> 00:53:50,074
I told you, unless we need to.

629
00:53:51,411 --> 00:53:54,416
Look, we keep these
on, they're not gonna

630
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:55,921
be able to tell who we are,

631
00:53:55,921 --> 00:53:58,119
so there's not gonna
be a need to hurt them.

632
00:53:58,119 --> 00:53:59,720
You think they're that stupid?

633
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,719
What?

634
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:03,401
Three strangers visit them,
and the very next night their

635
00:54:03,401 --> 00:54:07,132
castle gets robbed, even those
stupidos can figure it out.

636
00:54:07,132 --> 00:54:09,095
Unless we're spotted by the skull heads.

637
00:54:09,095 --> 00:54:11,923
[L.J.] The skull heads,
I'm so scared, I'm shaking.

638
00:54:11,923 --> 00:54:13,689
I can't believe you
can keep a straight face

639
00:54:13,689 --> 00:54:15,766
while talking to her about that shit.

640
00:54:15,766 --> 00:54:17,889
That's one stupid little girl

641
00:54:17,889 --> 00:54:19,972
you've got your eye on my friend.

642
00:54:19,972 --> 00:54:23,904
I don't have my eye on her,
alright, and she's not stupid.

643
00:54:23,904 --> 00:54:25,062
If you say so.

644
00:54:25,062 --> 00:54:26,290
[Jensen] And you're not gonna hurt her.

645
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:27,626
Whatever you say boss.

646
00:54:27,626 --> 00:54:30,293
- Alright, let's go.
- Let's go.

647
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,153
[Lisbeth] Did you say
goodnight to father?

648
00:54:40,153 --> 00:54:41,844
(grunting)

649
00:54:41,844 --> 00:54:44,535
You know how he likes
when you visit him.

650
00:54:44,535 --> 00:54:46,466
He doesn't even know I'm there.

651
00:54:46,466 --> 00:54:49,048
That's not true, of course he does.

652
00:54:49,048 --> 00:54:53,646
I didn't see Naomi in her
room before I retired.

653
00:54:53,646 --> 00:54:56,926
Don't tell me you still have
her trussed up downstairs.

654
00:54:56,926 --> 00:54:59,325
Gotta do something
to maintain discipline.

655
00:54:59,325 --> 00:55:01,721
Brat's out of control.

656
00:55:01,721 --> 00:55:05,471
Carver, you're becoming
obsessively obtuse.

657
00:55:10,816 --> 00:55:13,752
You know how those bug words turn me on.

658
00:55:13,752 --> 00:55:16,078
Can you please table
your prurient interests

659
00:55:16,078 --> 00:55:17,743
for two minutes while we have

660
00:55:17,743 --> 00:55:20,436
a civilized tet-a-tete about our daughter?

661
00:55:20,436 --> 00:55:22,742
Oh man, you've got a filthy mouth.

662
00:55:22,742 --> 00:55:25,492
Can you not sense my reticence?

663
00:55:30,402 --> 00:55:32,789
Does this mean the
barn doors are closed?

664
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:36,956
Yes Carver, in your neolithic
world, that's what it means.

665
00:55:38,278 --> 00:55:40,904
Alright, I'll go down after
a while and let her out.

666
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:42,879
Wasn't gonna have her stay
down there all night anyway,

667
00:55:42,879 --> 00:55:44,382
if that's what you're worried about.

668
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:47,183
She's not like us Caver,
she's not like you and me,

669
00:55:47,183 --> 00:55:50,433
she's a free spirit, she's like mother.

670
00:55:51,752 --> 00:55:55,110
And I'm fearful she may not
be much longer in this house.

671
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:56,110
Like hell.

672
00:55:57,188 --> 00:55:58,823
You know, your disciplinary
actions will only

673
00:55:58,823 --> 00:56:00,902
serve to hasten her departure.

674
00:56:00,902 --> 00:56:02,318
She's not going anywhere,

675
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:04,837
not while I have anything to say about it.

676
00:56:04,837 --> 00:56:08,504
Well, don't be so
sure of that sweetheart.

677
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:19,720
Carver, Carver, I hear something.

678
00:56:21,782 --> 00:56:23,425
Everything feels fine to me.

679
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:26,871
No, there's something
wrong with this house.

680
00:56:26,871 --> 00:56:29,458
Oh, one of your spooky feeling again?

681
00:56:29,458 --> 00:56:31,487
You know what, you
know I can sense things,

682
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:33,452
don't poke fun at me.

683
00:56:33,452 --> 00:56:36,285
Okay, how about I just poke you?

684
00:56:38,842 --> 00:56:41,592
Oh Carver, you're incorrigible.

685
00:56:52,581 --> 00:56:53,414
What do we do?

686
00:56:53,414 --> 00:56:56,997
We work around him,
we've done it before.

687
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:02,814
Look, he's sleeping off a drunk.

688
00:57:04,401 --> 00:57:06,539
He won't be awake for hours.

689
00:57:06,539 --> 00:57:07,854
Okay, grab whatever you can carry

690
00:57:07,854 --> 00:57:09,778
and stack it by the rear doors.

691
00:57:09,778 --> 00:57:11,775
Once we're loaded up, we go.

692
00:57:11,775 --> 00:57:13,653
Jensen, you go down to the basement,

693
00:57:13,653 --> 00:57:16,234
we saw some good stuff down there.

694
00:57:16,234 --> 00:57:17,317
Why me?

695
00:57:17,317 --> 00:57:20,317
What? Don't tell me you're scared.

696
00:57:42,579 --> 00:57:44,790
Carver, Carver wake up.

697
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:45,623
What?

698
00:57:47,292 --> 00:57:48,824
Something's wrong.

699
00:57:48,824 --> 00:57:49,657
What?

700
00:57:49,657 --> 00:57:52,218
Something wrong, I can hear something.

701
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:54,341
Something's wrong in this house.

702
00:57:54,341 --> 00:57:58,508
You said that before, one
of your spooky feelings,

703
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,374
your fifth sense?

704
00:58:01,374 --> 00:58:02,541
Sixth sense.

705
00:58:03,468 --> 00:58:04,885
Yeah, that too.

706
00:58:06,614 --> 00:58:10,781
No, I'm serious, this time
I think I heard something.

707
00:58:13,976 --> 00:58:16,143
(moaning)

708
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:20,667
Dad, dad.

709
00:58:27,861 --> 00:58:28,694
Naomi.

710
00:58:30,739 --> 00:58:33,269
Jensen, what are you doing here?

711
00:58:33,269 --> 00:58:35,769
Why are you dressed like that?

712
00:58:38,978 --> 00:58:40,156
It's not important.

713
00:58:40,156 --> 00:58:43,323
Oh it's all black, you look so sexy.

714
00:58:46,304 --> 00:58:49,283
Who put you in this
thing, did your dad do this?

715
00:58:49,283 --> 00:58:52,602
Of course, I told you it's
what happens when I misbehave.

716
00:58:52,602 --> 00:58:53,849
But it's not right.

717
00:58:53,849 --> 00:58:55,877
I told you, it's just
the way we do things.

718
00:58:55,877 --> 00:58:59,127
We need to get you out of here, okay?

719
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:08,899
There's still more in the dining room.

720
00:59:08,899 --> 00:59:10,334
The retard's still asleep?

721
00:59:10,334 --> 00:59:12,924
Like a dead fish, if he
wakes up I'll handle him.

722
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,749
Alright, I'll clear out
the stuff near the stairs,

723
00:59:14,749 --> 00:59:18,916
by then Jensen should be done
and we can get out of here.

724
00:59:21,327 --> 00:59:22,160
Come on.

725
00:59:24,196 --> 00:59:25,863
Thank you so much.

726
00:59:26,871 --> 00:59:29,691
We need to get out of here, okay?

727
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:30,751
Okay.

728
00:59:30,751 --> 00:59:32,353
- Come on.
- Okay.

729
00:59:32,353 --> 00:59:34,603
(giggling)

730
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:57,775
Well, so much for your fifth sense dear.

731
00:59:57,775 --> 01:00:00,735
Everything looks as normal as always.

732
01:00:00,735 --> 01:00:03,024
Oh yeah, and what about that?

733
01:00:03,024 --> 01:00:04,171
What about it?

734
01:00:04,171 --> 01:00:07,671
Where's the vase that goes on top of it?

735
01:00:09,982 --> 01:00:10,815
Damn.

736
01:00:12,411 --> 01:00:13,244
Honey.

737
01:00:16,967 --> 01:00:18,300
What the hell?

738
01:00:19,903 --> 01:00:23,348
Jensen says that I
shouldn't be treated that way.

739
01:00:23,348 --> 01:00:26,159
He says that I deserve better,
isn't that sweet of him?

740
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:30,981
Hey Jensen, will you take
me to Hollywood with you?

741
01:00:30,981 --> 01:00:34,672
Girl, this guy doesn't
give a rats ass about you.

742
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:38,922
He's just here to rip us
off, him and his partners.

743
01:00:38,922 --> 01:00:40,444
Where are they, huh?

744
01:00:40,444 --> 01:00:42,361
Jensen, is that true?

745
01:00:44,545 --> 01:00:49,027
No, not all of it,
look, I don't want you

746
01:00:49,027 --> 01:00:53,027
to have to stay here if
you don't want to, okay?

747
01:00:53,918 --> 01:00:55,509
You're so sweet.

748
01:00:55,509 --> 01:00:58,778
Like it's up to her
whether she comes or goes.

749
01:00:58,778 --> 01:01:01,009
She's old enough to
make up her own mind.

750
01:01:01,009 --> 01:01:04,676
She's an Arkoff, she
belongs here with us.

751
01:01:06,677 --> 01:01:10,231
Mom, I have to leave, I
can't stay here forever.

752
01:01:10,231 --> 01:01:12,429
I understand that sweetheart,

753
01:01:12,429 --> 01:01:14,988
but we've had this conversation before.

754
01:01:14,988 --> 01:01:17,023
We're family, remember?

755
01:01:17,023 --> 01:01:21,632
This is a special family,
we have to stick together.

756
01:01:21,632 --> 01:01:23,382
Jensen she's right.

757
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:27,472
You see Mr. Curry,
when it comes to family,

758
01:01:27,472 --> 01:01:30,889
we're very, very close, closer than most.

759
01:01:31,873 --> 01:01:34,290
What are you talking about?

760
01:01:35,504 --> 01:01:39,671
Naomi, she's not only my
daughter, she's also my niece.

761
01:01:44,244 --> 01:01:46,369
What do you mean?

762
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:49,446
Carver and I, we're not man and wife,

763
01:01:49,446 --> 01:01:51,971
we're brother and sister.

764
01:01:51,971 --> 01:01:54,304
(chuckling)

765
01:01:58,157 --> 01:01:59,740
You mean you two,

766
01:02:04,446 --> 01:02:05,279
and you?

767
01:02:06,515 --> 01:02:09,721
Naomi understands, she can't leave us,

768
01:02:09,721 --> 01:02:12,473
she wouldn't do well out in the world.

769
01:02:12,473 --> 01:02:15,967
Just because I have
to stay in the castle

770
01:02:15,967 --> 01:02:19,217
doesn't mean that you can't be with me.

771
01:02:22,717 --> 01:02:24,300
Naomi, I'm sorry.

772
01:02:26,378 --> 01:02:28,711
You're not leaving either.

773
01:02:29,802 --> 01:02:31,969
(gunshot)

774
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:35,013
Mamma.

775
01:02:46,385 --> 01:02:48,381
You didn't have to shoot her.

776
01:02:48,381 --> 01:02:53,248
Of course I did, you
idiot, they can identify you,

777
01:02:53,248 --> 01:02:54,998
they can identify us.

778
01:02:56,213 --> 01:02:57,213
You bitch.

779
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:00,526
(gunshot)

780
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:02,859
(screaming)

781
01:03:25,263 --> 01:03:27,513
(grunting)

782
01:03:32,938 --> 01:03:35,021
(crying)

783
01:03:38,202 --> 01:03:40,516
You weren't supposed to kill them.

784
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:43,080
They saw us, I told
you what would happen.

785
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,871
Besides, they were sick fucks,
brother and sister doing it?

786
01:03:46,871 --> 01:03:49,196
And she's the retarded inbred daughter.

787
01:03:49,196 --> 01:03:52,018
You really know how to pick 'em buddy.

788
01:03:52,018 --> 01:03:53,601
Naomi, I'm sorry.

789
01:03:56,957 --> 01:04:00,540
Dad was right, you're
not from Hollywood.

790
01:04:02,923 --> 01:04:03,756
Duh.

791
01:04:05,513 --> 01:04:08,340
You just wanted to steal from us.

792
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:12,433
I didn't want this, Naomi no one was...

793
01:04:12,433 --> 01:04:14,464
You're lying.

794
01:04:14,464 --> 01:04:15,683
[Jensen] No, I'm not.

795
01:04:15,683 --> 01:04:16,516
Go.

796
01:04:17,993 --> 01:04:22,035
This is all very sweet, but
it's time to say goodbye now.

797
01:04:22,035 --> 01:04:24,618
I warned you what would happen.

798
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:28,243
No.

799
01:04:30,313 --> 01:04:33,040
That's the way you wanna play huh?

800
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,290
I told you you're not gonna hurt her.

801
01:04:37,659 --> 01:04:40,076
Are you here to protect me?

802
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:44,035
You really care about me, don't you?

803
01:04:44,035 --> 01:04:46,990
Alright, let's go both of you, come on.

804
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:47,823
Go, go.

805
01:04:58,307 --> 01:05:01,390
(apprehensive music)

806
01:05:06,914 --> 01:05:08,234
Come on.

807
01:05:08,234 --> 01:05:09,984
Kimi don't do this.

808
01:05:13,889 --> 01:05:15,340
Hey honey, why don't you do me a favor

809
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:17,681
show me how your daddy straps
you in that thing over there.

810
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:18,990
Okay.

811
01:05:18,990 --> 01:05:20,640
[Kimi] And put your boyfriend into it.

812
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,807
(giggling) Come on.

813
01:05:27,814 --> 01:05:28,876
Don't worry.

814
01:05:28,876 --> 01:05:30,277
Let's go.

815
01:05:30,277 --> 01:05:31,860
Kimi don't do this.

816
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:33,443
Shut the fuck up.

817
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:41,547
Naomi this isn't a game.

818
01:05:44,578 --> 01:05:45,745
Okay, there.

819
01:05:46,655 --> 01:05:50,822
Great, go over here, c'mon
c'mon, let's go over here, go.

820
01:05:54,337 --> 01:05:56,033
Hey Jensen don't worry about it,

821
01:05:56,033 --> 01:05:59,583
it's not gonna hurt that much, okay?

822
01:05:59,583 --> 01:06:00,916
You can watch.

823
01:06:04,768 --> 01:06:07,018
(groaning)

824
01:06:08,706 --> 01:06:12,668
I don't like partners who go against me.

825
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:14,378
[Jensen] Kimi don't do this.

826
01:06:14,378 --> 01:06:17,130
The last partner who went
against me, you know what I did?

827
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:19,213
I buried him in concrete.

828
01:06:20,116 --> 01:06:22,607
You know what they built
on top of that concrete?

829
01:06:22,607 --> 01:06:24,599
A police station.

830
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:26,784
Cops have been looking for
that douchebag for two years

831
01:06:26,784 --> 01:06:30,201
and he's right under their fucking noses.

832
01:06:31,314 --> 01:06:33,233
That's funny.

833
01:06:33,233 --> 01:06:35,767
Hey your retarded girlfriend
has a sense of humor.

834
01:06:35,767 --> 01:06:39,017
Let's see if she thinks this is a riot.

835
01:06:41,192 --> 01:06:43,609
Dad never uses that button.

836
01:06:45,091 --> 01:06:47,165
I'll send flowers to your grave.

837
01:06:47,165 --> 01:06:50,665
No, no, no, no, no, Jensen, Jensen stop.

838
01:06:52,738 --> 01:06:55,238
Jensen, Jensen, help, help me.

839
01:07:12,204 --> 01:07:13,954
L.J. what happened?

840
01:07:18,906 --> 01:07:21,906
I don't know, got hit on the head.

841
01:07:24,195 --> 01:07:26,303
Must have been the big dummy.

842
01:07:26,303 --> 01:07:30,353
C'mon, Jensen's out, let's
get the shit and get going.

843
01:07:30,353 --> 01:07:31,186
Let's go.

844
01:07:37,654 --> 01:07:40,404
(doors creaking)

845
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:48,214
(buzzing)

846
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:04,493
No, Jensen, Jensen, no, no, no, no.

847
01:08:05,867 --> 01:08:07,617
No, stop, no, Jensen.

848
01:08:10,106 --> 01:08:13,134
Uncle Peter, uncle Peter there,

849
01:08:13,134 --> 01:08:15,761
uncle Peter, help Jensen,
help, no, no, no, no

850
01:08:15,761 --> 01:08:16,912
not me, not me, no, help Jensen,

851
01:08:16,912 --> 01:08:18,679
help Jensen
(mumbling)

852
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:22,013
No, he's not, he
saved my life, help him.

853
01:08:22,013 --> 01:08:24,263
Help him, stop the machine,

854
01:08:27,014 --> 01:08:30,347
uncle Peter please, please, turn it off,

855
01:08:31,776 --> 01:08:33,443
c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

856
01:08:40,224 --> 01:08:41,391
Oh, thank you.

857
01:08:42,387 --> 01:08:43,220
Thank you.

858
01:08:44,619 --> 01:08:46,468
Are you okay?

859
01:08:46,468 --> 01:08:47,700
I'm so glad you're okay.

860
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:50,700
C'mon, we need to get out of here.

861
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:31,731
(screaming)

862
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:38,551
Come on, come on, let's get out of here.

863
01:09:38,551 --> 01:09:40,051
Come on, let's go.

864
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:47,429
Going somewhere?

865
01:09:47,429 --> 01:09:49,118
(screaming)

866
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:52,939
We told you we don't take to strangers.

867
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:55,942
I'm afraid you should
have heeded his warning.

868
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:58,275
(screaming)

869
01:10:07,714 --> 01:10:09,964
(grunting)

870
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:16,266
Claudia, you've
under-cooked the meat tonight.

871
01:10:16,266 --> 01:10:17,349
Unacceptable.

872
01:10:18,739 --> 01:10:22,239
Carver, don't be so boorish and uncouth.

873
01:10:23,092 --> 01:10:25,342
(grunting)

874
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,517
(panting)

875
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:34,095
Jesus,

876
01:10:35,824 --> 01:10:39,060
Kimi and L.J. they must have
hidden the bodies, but why?

877
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:40,841
I gotta go check on grandpa.

878
01:10:40,841 --> 01:10:41,971
Naomi, no.

879
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:43,695
I'm not leaving out grandpa.

880
01:10:43,695 --> 01:10:45,112
[Jensen] Naomi.

881
01:11:00,635 --> 01:11:05,108
Grandpa, I'm so glad that
you're okay, I was so worried.

882
01:11:05,108 --> 01:11:07,525
Naomi c'mon, we have to go.

883
01:11:12,424 --> 01:11:13,424
Naomi c'mon.

884
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:17,771
(chuckling)

885
01:11:36,321 --> 01:11:37,154
Holy shit.

886
01:11:38,303 --> 01:11:39,553
What's wrong?

887
01:11:41,304 --> 01:11:42,887
Naomi, he's dead.

888
01:11:45,169 --> 01:11:49,336
(chuckling) Silly, grandpas never die.

889
01:11:51,251 --> 01:11:54,213
Naomi he's been dead for
years, he's a fucking mummy.

890
01:11:54,213 --> 01:11:56,380
You don't listen to him.

891
01:11:59,658 --> 01:12:02,991
Jensen, grandpa and I have been talking,

892
01:12:03,845 --> 01:12:05,386
we think it's really sweet that you

893
01:12:05,386 --> 01:12:07,844
wanna take me away from here,

894
01:12:07,844 --> 01:12:10,427
really I do, but I'm an Arkoff,

895
01:12:12,413 --> 01:12:15,330
and us Arkoffs must stick together.

896
01:12:17,521 --> 01:12:18,472
Naomi I...

897
01:12:18,472 --> 01:12:22,639
I can't leave this castle,
it just wouldn't be right.

898
01:12:24,906 --> 01:12:29,492
Naomi, I'm still willing
to take you with me,

899
01:12:29,492 --> 01:12:32,426
listen to me, Naomi listen
to me, listen to me,

900
01:12:32,426 --> 01:12:35,763
look you have to get out of
this castle, you need help.

901
01:12:35,763 --> 01:12:38,930
You and I are like Romeo and Juliet,

902
01:12:42,096 --> 01:12:44,013
but grandpa knows best.

903
01:12:45,832 --> 01:12:48,165
(screaming)

904
01:12:49,661 --> 01:12:51,502
Don't worry grandpa.

905
01:12:51,502 --> 01:12:54,252
(dramatic music)

906
01:13:14,109 --> 01:13:15,109
Holy shit.

907
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,850
(shooting)

908
01:13:26,752 --> 01:13:29,672
(laughing)

909
01:13:29,672 --> 01:13:33,314
You tried to take our
little girl from us.

910
01:13:33,314 --> 01:13:34,981
My innocent Naomi.

911
01:13:40,296 --> 01:13:42,004
Don't bother Carver.

912
01:13:42,004 --> 01:13:43,308
He'll get away.

913
01:13:43,308 --> 01:13:45,891
No he won't, I have his keys.

914
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:49,739
(laughing)

915
01:13:53,794 --> 01:13:55,961
(panting)

916
01:13:58,370 --> 01:14:00,703
(screaming)

917
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:12,957
(slow eerie music)

918
01:18:20,032 --> 01:18:22,745
[Voiceover] This is a special family,

919
01:18:22,745 --> 01:18:24,912
we have to stick together.

920
01:18:27,047 --> 01:18:30,432
When it comes to family, we're very close.

921
01:18:30,432 --> 01:18:31,849
Closer than most.

922
01:18:34,068 --> 01:18:36,463
You're too hard on her,
she's only a teenager.

923
01:18:36,463 --> 01:18:38,262
Not hard enough, I say.

924
01:18:38,262 --> 01:18:39,793
[Voiceover] She's not like you and me,

925
01:18:39,793 --> 01:18:41,513
she's a free spirit.

926
01:18:41,513 --> 01:18:44,065
I wanna go out, and
I wanna see the world

927
01:18:44,065 --> 01:18:45,869
and I wanna meet people.

928
01:18:45,869 --> 01:18:48,466
[Voiceover] As Arkoffs,
we do things our own way.

929
01:18:48,466 --> 01:18:50,223
Some people think we're different,

930
01:18:50,223 --> 01:18:53,420
I would like to think that we're unique.

931
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:56,435
Unique rhymes with freak.

932
01:18:56,435 --> 01:18:57,892
[Voiceover] I'm sure there's a lot of

933
01:18:57,892 --> 01:19:00,892
interesting stuff about this castle.

934
01:19:02,314 --> 01:19:04,463
Something's wrong, I can hear something,

935
01:19:04,463 --> 01:19:06,409
something's wrong in this house.

936
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:10,060
Those are the protectors,
they protect the house from evil

937
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:11,477
The protectors?

938
01:19:12,686 --> 01:19:17,083
An old Italian legend,
referring to the elementals,

939
01:19:17,083 --> 01:19:20,141
some call them skull heads.

940
01:19:20,141 --> 01:19:22,148
Creatures born from witchcraft.

941
01:19:22,148 --> 01:19:24,949
It's said that they have
the power to bring life

942
01:19:24,949 --> 01:19:29,116
and to take it, to bring the
dead back from the grave.

943
01:19:31,202 --> 01:19:33,535
(screaming)

944
01:19:43,927 --> 01:19:46,094
(panting)

945
01:19:48,407 --> 01:19:50,740
(screaming)
