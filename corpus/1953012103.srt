1
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,818
THERE'S A PROGRAM BEING SEEN
ON P.B.S. NETWORK AT THE MOMENT.

2
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,470
AND IT'S CALLED
"AN AMERICAN FAMILY."

3
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:24,073
AND IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY
DOCUMENTARY. IT'S IN 12 PARTS.

4
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,158
<i>AND IT PROBES
THE DAY-TO-DAY LIVES</i>

5
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,494
<i>OF A FAMILY FROM
SANTA BARBARA, CALIFORNIA.</i>

6
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,279
<i>THEY AGREED
TO LET A FILM CREW</i>

7
00:00:30,313 --> 00:00:32,081
<i>LIVE WITH THEM
FOR MONTHS ON END</i>

8
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,983
<i>AND THEIR MOST PRIVATE
MOMENTS HAVE BECOME PUBLIC.</i>

9
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:38,287
THE SERIES HAS BEEN WIDELY
REVIEWED AND CRITICIZED.

10
00:00:38,321 --> 00:00:40,539
<i>AND NOBODY IS SURE--
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT--</i>

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,459
<i>WHY THEY LET THEMSELVES IN
FOR SOME OF THE THINGS THEY DID.</i>

12
00:00:43,493 --> 00:00:47,046
<i>BUT THAT'LL BE ONE OF THE THINGS
MAYBE WE WILL BE ABLE TO FIND OUT.</i>

13
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,633
I HAD THIS VISION
OF THE LOUD FAMILY

14
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:55,104
THAT I JUST
COULDN'T SHAKE--

15
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,356
SEVEN PEOPLE

16
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,977
STANDING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER
IN SOLIDARITY,

17
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:06,198
BONDED BY BLOOD
AND TIME AND LOVE...

18
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:15,040
WITH A HUSBAND AND A FATHER
WHO WAS HOME AND THERE FOR US ALL.

19
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:28,587
<i>¶ STARS SHINING BRIGHT
ABOVE YOU ¶</i>

20
00:01:28,638 --> 00:01:32,174
<i>¶ NIGHT BREEZES
SEEM TO WHISPER ¶</i>

21
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:34,309
<i>¶ I LOVE YOU ¶</i>

22
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:38,680
<i>¶ BIRDS SINGING
IN THE SYCAMORE TREE ¶</i>

23
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:43,519
<i>¶ DREAM A LITTLE DREAM
OF ME ¶</i>

24
00:01:45,155 --> 00:01:50,492
<i>¶ SAY NIGHTY-NIGHT
AND KISS ME ¶</i>

25
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,528
<i>¶ JUST HOLD ME TIGHT ¶</i>

26
00:01:52,562 --> 00:01:55,831
<i>¶ AND TELL ME
YOU'LL MISS ME ¶</i>

27
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,183
<i>¶ WHILE I'M ALONE ¶</i>

28
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,669
<i>¶ AND BLUE AS CAN BE ¶</i>

29
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:05,340
<i>¶ DREAM A LITTLE DREAM
OF ME ¶</i>

30
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,927
<i>¶ STARS FADING ¶</i>

31
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:12,047
<i>¶ BUT I LINGER ON, DEAR ¶</i>

32
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:14,049
<i>¶ STILL CRAVING ¶</i>

33
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:17,603
<i>¶ YOUR KISS ¶</i>

34
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,522
<i>¶ I'M LONGING TO LINGER ¶</i>

35
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,058
<i>¶ TILL DAWN, DEAR ¶</i>

36
00:02:23,092 --> 00:02:28,147
<i>¶ JUST SAYING THIS ¶</i>

37
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:33,602
<i>¶ SWEET DREAMS TILL SUNBEAMS
FIND YOU ¶</i>

38
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,439
<i>¶ SWEET DREAMS THAT LEAVE
ALL WORRIES ¶</i>

39
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,241
<i>¶ BEHIND YOU ¶</i>

40
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:41,326
<i>¶ BUT IN YOUR DREAMS ¶</i>

41
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:43,912
<i>¶ WHATEVER THEY BE ¶</i>

42
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:49,168
<i>¶ DREAM A LITTLE DREAM
OF ME... ¶</i>

43
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:04,566
<i>¶ DREAM A LITTLE DREAM
OF ME... ¶</i>

44
00:03:20,316 --> 00:03:22,501
<i>- PAT.
- MARY.</i>

45
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,920
OH, RIGHT ON TIME.

46
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,838
WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?

47
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,707
OH, YOU'LL SEE.

48
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:31,493
COME, DEAR.
WE'RE SITTING RIGHT UP THERE.

49
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:35,664
<i>CRAIG.</i>

50
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:42,554
CRAIG GILBERT,
THIS IS PAT LOUD.

51
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:45,006
- HELLO.
- A PLEASURE.

52
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,192
- CRAIG'S A VISITOR FROM
THE BIG APPLE. - OH.

53
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,361
<i>- HE'S FRIENDS WITH
MY EDITOR. - WELCOME.</i>

54
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,179
WELL, PLEASE, SIT SIT.

55
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,516
CRAIG'S WORKING ON
A VERY INTERESTING PROJECT.

56
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,702
WELL, I MAKE
DOCUMENTARY FILMS, PAT--

57
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,353
NOTHING YOU'D
HAVE HEARD OF.

58
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,522
RECENTLY I JUST DID SOMETHING
ON THE WORK OF MARGARET MEAD.

59
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,357
SHE'S A WELL-KNOWN
ANTHROPOLOGIST.

60
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,244
YES, SHE WROTE "COMING OF AGE IN SAMOA,"
WHICH I QUITE ENJOYED.

61
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:07,829
<i>- I'M IMPRESSED. - SHE'S
DEAD ON ABOUT GENDER ROLES.</i>

62
00:04:07,863 --> 00:04:10,549
FATHERS ARE BIOLOGICAL NECESSITIES,
BUT SOCIAL ACCIDENTS.

63
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,418
SHE ALSO SAID, "I DON'T BELIEVE IN
USING WOMEN IN COMBAT BECAUSE

64
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:15,887
- THE FEMALES ARE TOO FIERCE."
- "FEMALES ARE TOO FIERCE."

65
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:20,309
WHY IS IT I THINK WE ALREADY KNOW
MORE ABOUT EACH OTHER THAN WE SHOULD?

66
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,928
DIDN'T I TELL YOU?
SHE'S PERFECT.

67
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,814
PAT, I WANT TO OBSERVE
AN AMERICAN FAMILY

68
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,517
MUCH LIKE MARGARET
OBSERVED A PRIMITIVE ONE,

69
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:32,020
EXCEPT THIS TIME I'D LIKE THE CAMERA
TEAM TO MOVE IN WITH THE FAMILY.

70
00:04:32,054 --> 00:04:35,023
AND I THINK THAT I FOUND
MY FAMILY LAST NIGHT

71
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:38,577
WHEN MARY TOLD ME ABOUT YOU
AND SHOWED ME

72
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,895
THIS WONDERFUL
CHRISTMAS CARD.

73
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:44,899
MM, WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT
TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH A THING?

74
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,786
WELL, TO EDUCATE. TO BE PART
OF A BRAVE NEW EXPERIMENT

75
00:04:47,837 --> 00:04:50,172
WITH A REAL FAMILY,
WITH REAL PEOPLE

76
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,207
THAT AUDIENCES
CAN RELATE TO.

77
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:56,762
YOU WERE HIS FIRST CHOICE. I SHOWED
HIM THE CARTERS, THE PERCYS, THE HALLS.

78
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,131
THEY'RE ALWAYS
IN HER SOCIETY COLUMN.

79
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:02,100
YES, BUT NONE ARE AS
INTERESTING AS THE LOUD FAMILY.

80
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:06,021
AND HER KIDS--
HER KIDS ARE SO POPULAR.

81
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:09,141
<i>EVERYONE'S ALWAYS
TALKING ABOUT THEM.</i>

82
00:05:14,364 --> 00:05:17,282
¶ TIME ¶

83
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,618
¶ IS ON MY SIDE ¶

84
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,037
¶ YES, IT IS ¶

85
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,740
¶ TIME ¶

86
00:05:24,774 --> 00:05:27,209
¶ IS ON MY SIDE ¶

87
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:30,111
¶ YES, IT IS ¶

88
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:33,298
¶ NOW YOU WERE SAYING ¶

89
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,550
<i>¶ THAT YOU WANT
TO BE FREE.... ¶</i>

90
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,918
<i>LANCE, WAIT UP.</i>

91
00:05:36,952 --> 00:05:38,804
COME ON, HURRY UP.
I CAN'T MISS IT.

92
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,722
DADDY TRIED TO BE HERE TOO,
YOU KNOW, SWEETIE,

93
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,591
BUT HIS BUSINESS TRIP
GOT EXTENDED.

94
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,460
AREN'T THEY ALWAYS?
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

95
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,179
- I LOVE YOU.
- OH, COLD NEW YORK NIGHTS--

96
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,730
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE
A LOW RESISTANCE, BABY.

97
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,315
<i>THEY'RE CLOSING
THE DOOR.  GO.</i>

98
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,300
<i>- BYE, LANCE.
- LOVE YOU.</i>

99
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,103
<i>- I'M GONNA MISS YOU.
- SAY HI TO ANDY WARHOL FOR ME.</i>

100
00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:56,521
<i>¶ GO AHEAD ¶</i>

101
00:05:56,572 --> 00:05:59,441
<i>¶ GO AND LIGHT UP
THAT TOWN ¶</i>

102
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:03,779
<i>¶ AND, BABY, DO EVERYTHING
YOUR HEART DESIRES ¶</i>

103
00:06:03,813 --> 00:06:07,199
<i>¶ REMEMBER,
I'LL BE AROUND ¶</i>

104
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,950
<i>¶ AND I KNOW ¶</i>

105
00:06:08,984 --> 00:06:13,154
<i>¶ LIKE I TOLD YOU
SO MANY TIMES BEFORE ¶</i>

106
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,156
<i>¶ OH, YOU'RE GONNA
COME BACK, BABY ¶</i>

107
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,042
<i>¶ YOU'RE GONNA
COME BACK ¶</i>

108
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:21,162
<i>¶ YOU'RE GONNA BE
KNOCK-KNOCKING ON MY DOOR ¶</i>

109
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:24,433
<i>¶ TIME TIME TIME ¶</i>

110
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,802
<i>¶ IS ON MY SIDE ¶</i>

111
00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:28,603
<i>- ¶ YES, IT IS.... ¶
- Girl: DAD'S HERE.</i>

112
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,439
- HEY, DAD.
- HEY, DAD, WHAT'S UP?

113
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:35,026
- HEY. - LOOKING GOOD.
NICE SUIT, MAN.

114
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,779
YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE BACK TILL TOMORROW.

115
00:06:42,017 --> 00:06:43,819
<i>HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?</i>

116
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:46,405
<i>HEY, JOE NAMATH.</i>

117
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,712
<i>- HEY, PATTY?
- HMM?</i>

118
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,797
<i>YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING
WHEN I GOT HOME TONIGHT?</i>

119
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,532
WHAT'S THAT, BILL?

120
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,702
<i>WHEN I SAW THOSE KIDS
PLAYING OUT THERE ON THE LAWN,</i>

121
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,473
<i>RUNNING AROUND WITH THE
SUNLIGHT IN THEIR HAIR,</i>

122
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,975
<i>I WAS THINKING
WE ARE LIKE--</i>

123
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,145
- YOUR HAIRBRUSH.
- MY HAIRBRUSH?

124
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:13,482
- IT'S CLEAN.
- AND?

125
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,551
- WHO CLEANED IT?
- I CLEANED IT.

126
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,904
YOU'VE NEVER CLEANED YOUR
HAIRBRUSH IN YOUR LIFE.

127
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,723
PATTY, I'VE CLEANED
MY BRUSH BEFORE

128
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,775
AND I CLEANED IT
THIS TIME.

129
00:07:23,826 --> 00:07:25,243
WHY?

130
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,697
BECAUSE IT HAD
DOG HAIR IN IT.

131
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:32,000
BILL NEVIN'S FOUR-YEAR-OLD
OPENS UP MY SUITCASE

132
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:35,287
AND BRUSHES HIS GOLDEN
RETRIEVER WITH MY HAIRBRUSH.

133
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:38,957
<i>- UNBELIEVABLE, RIGHT?
- I AGREE.</i>

134
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:40,575
SO WHAT I WAS
TRYING TO SAY WAS

135
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,628
THAT WHEN I WAS OUT THERE
PLAYING FOOTBALL ON THE LAWN,

136
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:46,965
I WAS THINKING WE'RE LIKE
THE WEST COAST KENNEDYS.

137
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:49,601
DO YOU MEAN THAT AS
A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING?

138
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,970
IT'S A COMPLIMENT,
PATTY.

139
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:54,806
I'M SAYING WE'VE GOT
A FAMILY TO BE PROUD OF HERE.

140
00:07:54,857 --> 00:07:56,558
IT'S INTERESTING
YOU SHOULD MENTION THAT,

141
00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:58,860
BECAUSE I MET A FILMMAKER
WHO'S LOOKING FOR

142
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,812
THE IDEAL FAMILY
TO PUT ON TV.

143
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:02,280
REALLY?

144
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,733
OF COURSE I TOLD HIM
WE COULDN'T PARTICIPATE,

145
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:07,268
BEING THAT YOU'RE
AWAY SO MUCH.

146
00:08:09,438 --> 00:08:11,439
HOLD ON A MINUTE.

147
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:14,292
I'D LIKE TO HEAR
MORE ABOUT THIS.

148
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,945
<i>I CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT YOU KNEW ALICE.</i>

149
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,280
SHE WAS MY SOPHOMORE
ROOMMATE AT STANFORD.

150
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,166
HER BROTHER JIMMY WAS
IN MY HOUSE AT HARVARD.

151
00:08:21,217 --> 00:08:22,667
<i>OH MY,
WHAT A SMALL WORLD.</i>

152
00:08:22,718 --> 00:08:24,586
<i>SO, BILL,
WHERE DID YOU STUDY?</i>

153
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,806
I MATRICULATED AT
THE SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS.

154
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,624
YES, BILL WASN'T
MUCH OF A STUDENT,

155
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,677
BUT HE MAKES MORE MONEY
THAN MOST IVY LEAGUERS.

156
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:35,230
YOU KNOW WHAT THE SECRET IS?
YOU GOTTA LOVE IT.

157
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,015
IF YOU DON'T LOVE IT,
YOU CAN'T SELL IT.

158
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:39,601
<i>GOD HELP ME, YOU CAN
LAUGH IF YOU WANT,</i>

159
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:42,437
BUT I LOVE STRIP MINES AND
I LOVE SELLING SHOVEL TEETH.

160
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:44,189
<i>IT'S LIKE BROADWAY,
BABY.</i>

161
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,807
MR. GILBERT SAW "HAIR"
ON BROADWAY.

162
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,742
HE SAID IT WAS LIKE
A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME EXPERIENCE.

163
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,361
YEAH, MR. GILBERT KNOWS
MICK JAGGER TOO.

164
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:51,145
YOUR BOYS HAVE
PROMISED ME A CONCERT.

165
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,415
WAIT UNTIL YOU MEET LANCE.
HE'S THE COOLEST OF US ALL.

166
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,917
<i>- BUT HE MOVED TO NEW YORK.
- TO MEET ANDY WARHOL.</i>

167
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,786
WELL, WE CAN SHOOT HIM
IN NEW YORK.

168
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,320
BUT HE'S NOT
IN THE HOUSE,

169
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:00,505
AND THAT'S WHAT
THE SHOW IS, RIGHT--

170
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,290
WHAT GOES ON
IN THE HOUSE?

171
00:09:02,324 --> 00:09:05,460
THE HOUSE, THE SCHOOL, THE SUPERMARKET,
WHEREVER THE FAMILY GOES.

172
00:09:05,494 --> 00:09:08,847
- WHAT ABOUT THE BATHROOM?
- NO NO.

173
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,599
SERIOUSLY,
WHAT IS OFF-LIMITS?

174
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,350
WHY, BILL?  YOU HAVE
SOMETHING TO HIDE?

175
00:09:13,836 --> 00:09:15,554
<i>WELL, NO, THAT'S
A FAIR QUESTION--</i>

176
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:17,022
THE THRESHOLD
OF PRIVACY.

177
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,173
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE
TO DISCUSS AND DECIDE UPON.

178
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,859
WHAT ABOUT PAYMENT?

179
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,194
NO NO.  THE PUBLIC
HAS TO BE CERTAIN

180
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,896
THERE'S NO MANIPULATION
GOING ON.

181
00:09:24,947 --> 00:09:27,966
I DON'T KNOW THEN. I STILL
DON'T SEE ANY UPSIDE TO IT.

182
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,785
<i>COME ON, DAD.
IT'LL BE SO MUCH FUN.</i>

183
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,123
WELL, YOU MIGHT,
WHEN YOU SEE JOHNNY HALL

184
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:38,043
AS THE HEAD OF THE MOST
FAMOUS HOUSEHOLD IN AMERICA.

185
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,210
- JOHNNY HALL?
- MM.

186
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,496
WHAT'S SO GREAT
ABOUT HIS FAMILY?

187
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,498
HIS WIFE HAS GOT
A MUSTACHE

188
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:45,417
AND HIS KIDS ARE
PRACTICALLY BRAIN DEAD.

189
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:47,419
<i>DAD!</i>

190
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,389
- SO THAT WOULD BE A YES?
- YES.

191
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:55,376
WHEN BILL WOULD
GO AWAY,

192
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:59,547
I WAS JUST LEFT AT HOME
WITH MY OWN WORST FEARS.

193
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,850
FINALLY I DECIDED THAT...

194
00:10:01,884 --> 00:10:05,570
WHAT I NEEDED TO DO
WAS TO KEEP BILL HOME

195
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,024
AND SHOW HIM
AND THE WORLD

196
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:12,393
THAT HIS FAMILY WAS
AN INDESTRUCTIBLE THING.

197
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:15,580
<i>GENTLEMEN, MEET THE LOUDS.</i>

198
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,083
THE HANDSOME, HARD-WORKING,
NIXON-SUPPORTING DAD,

199
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,918
THE SMART,
SULTRY MOM.

200
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,920
SHE'S A LITTLE TOO LATE
FOR WOMEN'S LIB,

201
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,039
BUT TOO YOUNG TO BE
A DISCARDED HOUSEWIFE.

202
00:10:24,073 --> 00:10:26,007
THE 16 YEAR-OLD
DAUGHTER

203
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,843
WHO IS EXPERIENCING
HER FIRST SERIOUS BOYFRIEND.

204
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,129
THE LITTLE ONE WHO IS IN LOVE
WITH HER HORSE.

205
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,248
THE TWO BOYS WHO THINK
THEY'RE THE NEXT ROLLING STONES.

206
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,635
<i>AND THE ELDEST-- HE'S MOVED
TO MANHATTAN TO MAKE IT.</i>

207
00:10:36,686 --> 00:10:38,720
I HAVE YET
TO MEET HIM.

208
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:40,922
WHY NO APPLAUSE HERE,
GENTLEMEN?

209
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,391
FOR WHAT, FIVE HOURS OF
"PASS THE SALT"? I DON'T GET THE POINT.

210
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:45,393
THE POINT IS WE'VE GONE
TO THE MOON AND BEYOND,

211
00:10:45,427 --> 00:10:48,279
BUT WE HAVE YET TO GET PAST
THE AMERICAN FRONT DOOR.

212
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,864
AND WHEN WE GET
PAST THAT DOOR,

213
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,449
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE'RE GOING TO FIND?

214
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,101
THE SMILING FACES
ON THE CHRISTMAS CARDS?

215
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,987
<i>THE CUTE LITTLE JOKES
WITH THE LAUGH TRACKS?  NO.</i>

216
00:10:56,038 --> 00:10:58,940
NOW ONE HAS EVER
DONE THIS BEFORE,

217
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,209
SO IF ANYONE SHOULD BE
ASKING WHAT THE POINT IS,

218
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,611
IT SHOULD BE ME--
OF HAVING TO BEG TO FINANCE

219
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,580
WHAT COULD BE
THE MOST GROUNDBREAKING

220
00:11:05,614 --> 00:11:08,166
10 HOURS OF TV
EVER PUT ON THE AIR.

221
00:11:08,217 --> 00:11:10,752
- 10 HOURS?
- YEAH.  YOU HEARD THAT.

222
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:12,286
I HEARD THAT, YES.

223
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,055
WELL, YOU JUST REMEMBER
THIS LAUGH

224
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,591
WHEN YOU SEE THE DAILIES
AND YOU'RE BEGGING ME FOR MORE.

225
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,426
ALL RIGHT, CRAIG, I'M GONNA
TAKE YOU UP ON THAT.

226
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,396
IF I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
THE REST OF THE FINANCING,

227
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,015
I NEED YOU HERE
TO SCREEN DAILIES

228
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:26,184
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY,
SO WE CAN BE SURE

229
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:27,986
YOU'RE GETTING SOMETHING
WORTH PUTTING ON.

230
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,571
<i>- ABSOLUTELY.
- MR. GILBERT.</i>

231
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,573
YOUR ASSISTANT PUT
A PHONE CALL THROUGH.

232
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:35,193
- THIS PICKS UP EVERYTHING? - MM-HMM,
I'M GONNA WRAP THIS AROUND RIGHT HERE.

233
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:38,029
YEAH, WE'LL BE PUTTING IN
SOME HIGHER-WATTAGE BULBS.

234
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,448
PAT, I WAS JUST
DESCRIBING YOU

235
00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:42,584
AND I USED AN ADJECTIVE
THAT ACTUALLY MADE ME BLUSH.

236
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,318
<i>Why aren't you here,
Craig?</i>

237
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,705
MY HOUSE IS BEING TORN APART
BY A BUNCH OF NEW YORKERS.

238
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:48,339
<i>They're just
prerigging a little.</i>

239
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,125
WHEN THEY'RE DONE
YOU'LL HARDLY NOTICE.

240
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,960
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT YOU
FILMING MY TRIP TO MANHATTAN?

241
00:11:51,994 --> 00:11:53,678
THEY SAY YOU WANT
TO START WITH THAT NOW?

242
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,097
WELL, YOU DECIDED TO VISIT
YOUR SON AND WE THOUGHT
THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING.

243
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,516
<i>By the way, where is Lance?
Where is he staying?</i>

244
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,168
OH, UM,

245
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,303
I BELIEVE HE'S STAYING
AT A PLACE CALLED

246
00:12:02,337 --> 00:12:04,839
THE, UH, CHELSEA HOTEL.

247
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,283
LANCE?

248
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:19,154
<i>WE'RE GOING TO THE
LA MAMA THEATER TONIGHT--</i>

249
00:12:19,188 --> 00:12:20,789
THE ULTIMATE
OF UNDERGROUND, HONEY.

250
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,407
YOU'LL JUST THINK
IT'S SO NEAT.

251
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,076
YEAH, ALL THE UNDERGROUND
STARS ARE THERE. IT'S A BIG PLACE.

252
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:27,412
ALL THESE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF.

253
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:30,165
OH, I KNOW, BUT YOU'VE
DREAMED OF THEM.

254
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:32,000
<i>¶ GOT TO PAY
YOUR DUES ¶</i>

255
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:33,835
<i>¶ IF YOU WANT
TO SING THE BLUES ¶</i>

256
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:37,705
<i>¶ AND YOU KNOW
IT DON'T COME EASY ¶</i>

257
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:40,759
<i>¶ BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SHOUT... ¶</i>

258
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,710
WHAT'VE WE GOT?

259
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,479
UH, FIVE-SIX.

260
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,564
I THINK THIS IS HER.

261
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,850
- YEAH.
- SLATE IT.

262
00:12:48,884 --> 00:12:50,384
ROLLING IT.

263
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,070
AN AMERICAN FAMILY,
TAKE ONE.

264
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,605
<i>GOT IT.</i>

265
00:12:53,656 --> 00:12:56,157
<i>ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA NEED
THAT SUN GUN WHEN WE GO IN THERE.</i>

266
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,660
<i>- THAT LOBBY'S TOO DARK.
- YEAH.</i>

267
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,398
WE'RE STARTING
RIGHT NOW?

268
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:06,501
YEAH, JUST KEEP ON COMING.
REMEMBER, WE'RE INVISIBLE.

269
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,286
YOU'RE RIGHT
IN FRONT OF ME.

270
00:13:08,337 --> 00:13:10,421
<i>IT'S OKAY. JUST KEEP WALKING.
WE'LL GIVE WAY.</i>

271
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,406
AND TRY NOT TO TALK
TO THE CAMERA, PAT.

272
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,408
DOES YOUR MOTHER
HAVE DARK HAIR,

273
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,928
LONG, SEXY LEGS,
HUGE SUNGLASSES

274
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,596
AND CAMERAS
FOLLOWING HER?

275
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,799
OR IS THAT
JACKIE O?

276
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,768
<i>OH MY GOD,

277
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,304
THIS IS HEAVEN.

278
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,610
OH, EXCUSE ME.

279
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,979
OH, JACKIE O.

280
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:38,399
HEY, BABY.
WANT SOME?

281
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:44,405
HELLO.  THE NAME'S
PATRICIA LOUD.

282
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:46,991
MY SON MADE A RESERVATION
FOR ME ON THE FOURTH FLOOR.

283
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:49,777
YEAH, HE WANTED YOU
ON EIGHT.

284
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,718
LANCE.

291
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,298
- YEAH.
- FINE FINE.

292
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,901
YES, WE GOT IN A LITTLE
EARLIER THAN EXPECTED.

293

<i>- OH.

00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:17,856
WELL, CAMERON SMOKES.
CAMERON, YOU TELL--

295
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:20,158
THAT'S--
I'M THE SMOKER.

296
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,527
WELL, I GUESS THAT'S
HIS MOTHER'S PROBLEM.

297
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:25,830
JUST SO LONG AS YOU
DON'T START.

298
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,984
- THIS PLACE COULD USE SOME
CLEANING. - UH, I KNOW.

299
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,670
THE MAID SERVICE HERE REALLY
IS JUST AWFUL, JUST TERRIBLE.

300
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,456
WELL, PERHAPS YOU OUGHT
TO APPLY FOR THE JOB.

301
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,208
I APPLIED FOR THE--
FOR THE CLEANING JOB,

302
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:38,793
BUT THEY SAID I HAD TO
WEAR A HAIR NET,

303
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:41,045
AND I JUST
COULDN'T DO THAT.

304
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,015
WHY DON'T YOU TELL HER
ABOUT THE SHOW?

305
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,717
OH, UM, YEAH.

306
00:14:45,768 --> 00:14:49,053

AMAZING SHOW AT LA MAMA THEATER--

OH, MOM, I KNOW SO MANY FAMOUS
AND INTERESTING PEOPLE NOW.

310
00:14:55,444 --> 00:14:56,694

LIKE JACKIE CURTIS
AND CANDY--

312
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,282
SHE'S RIGHT THERE.
SHE'S STARRING IN IT.

313
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,018
<i>- OH, SHE'S A FRIEND OF YOURS?
- SHE WANTS TO MARRY HIM ACTUALLY.</i>

314
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,686
- REALLY?
- OH YEAH.

315
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:06,955
SHE THINKS HE'S
THE ALL-AMERICAN BOY

316
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,190
<i>AND SHE'S
THE ALL-AMERICAN GIRL.</i>

317
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,325
SHE'S VERY PRETTY.

318
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:13,027
SO DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO YOUR ROOM NOW,

319
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,295
GO UP?

320
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,997
YOU SAID I'D BE
NEXT DOOR TO YOU.

321
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:17,382
WHY AM I UP THERE?

322
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,800
BECAUSE IT'S
BIG ENOUGH FOR YOU

323
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:22,720
TO SWEEP IN THE DOOR
LIKE LORETTA YOUNG, YOU KNOW.

324
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,875
THERE'S A CAMERA.

325
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,044
MY GOD, A CAMERA.
I HAD NO IDEA.

326
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,647
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE INVISIBLE
JUST LIKE THEY SAID YOU'D BE.

327
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,182
LISTEN, WE'LL BE
RIGHT BACK, OKAY?

328
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:35,850

331
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,566
¶ AND JIGGLE
YOUR SWEET SPOT ¶

332
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:56,621
¶ INTO MADCAP YEARNING,
OOH... ¶

333
00:15:56,655 --> 00:16:00,758

STAR OF ALL.</i>

<i>¶ MY PLACE TONIGHT,

BOY TO BE? ¶

337
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:17,608
<i>- OH, SOMEONE SPECIAL!
- OOH!</i>

338
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,695
<i>¶ DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT,
FELLAS ¶</i>

339
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,865

340

¶ WHY ARE THE BIG FELLAS
ALL FOR ME? ¶

341
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,821
IS THAT YOUR FRIEND
CANDY,

342
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:32,490
<i>THE ONE WHO WANTS
TO MARRY YOU?</i>

343
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,575
YES.

344
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:37,996
HMM.
SHE'S A MAN?

345
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:40,715
WELL, I HAVEN'T ACCEPTED
OR ANYTHING.

346
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,616

<i>¶ MY PLACE TONIGHT,

348
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,620
YOU DO REALIZE
THAT WE'RE BEING FOLLOWED

349
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,789
BY A CAMERA CREW,
LANCE, RIGHT?

350
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,791
DID YOU TAKE THAT
INTO CONSIDERATION

351
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,394
BEFORE YOU BROUGHT ME
HERE TONIGHT?

352
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,896
YES.

353
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,899

<i>¶ SHE'S GONNA CHOOSE... ¶</i>

357
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:08,142
I'M GONNA GO NOW,
SWEETIE.

358
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,111
ALL RIGHT.

359
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:13,865
ONE MUST NEVER LET THE
PUBLIC BEHIND THE SCENES,

360
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,034
FOR THEY ARE
EASILY DISILLUSIONED

361
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:19,153
<i>AND THEN THEY'RE
ANGRY WITH YOU.</i>

362
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:22,206
FOR IT IS THE ILLUSION
THEY LOVE.

363
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,346
PAT, HELLO.
SORRY I'M LATE.

364
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,849
CRAIG.  DID YOU KNOW
THAT THEY WERE TAKING ME
TO SEE THIS?

365
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,018
OH, OF COURSE NOT. I HAD
NO IDEA THAT WAS HAPPENING.

366
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,854
OH, IT'S NOT HAPPENING.
TRANSVESTITES?

367
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,439
THIS ALL GOT
STARTED OFF WRONG.

368
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,841
IF THIS SEQUENCE UPSETS YOU,
WE DON'T HAVE TO USE IT.

369
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,176
IT'S NOT ME.
IT'S BILL.

370
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,895
IF HE EVER SAW THIS
HE'D HAVE A STROKE.

371
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:45,847
<i>DON'T MAKE HIM LOOK
FOOLISH, CRAIG.</i>

372
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:47,965
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
LET ME JUST SAY SOMETHING.

373
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,985
I THINK LANCE IS AMAZING AND
I CAN TELL MY CREW DOES TOO.

374
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:54,372
HE'S SMART AND HE'S WITTY
AND HE'S INCREDIBLY SPECIAL.

375
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,624
WELL, I KNOW ALL THAT.

376
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,743
I'M JUST SCARED--

377
00:17:58,794 --> 00:18:01,496
THESE PEOPLE,
THIS PLACE.

378
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,331
WELL, HE'S TRYING
TO FIND HIMSELF

379
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:05,967
AND MANHATTAN IS
THE PLACE TO DO THAT.

380
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:09,804
<i>- YOU REALLY THINK SO?
- YES.</i>

381
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,923
NOW ARE YOU OKAY?

382
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:18,563
WELL, I'D GIVE YOU A HUG, BUT I DON'T
WANT TO SEEM INAPPROPRIATE.

383
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,548
WELL, I TELL YOU,

384
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,883
THERE REALLY IS
SOMETHING LIBERATING

385
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,103
ABOUT GETTING
OUT OF TOWN.

386
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:27,688
FOR ONCE IT'S ALL
IN BILL'S LAP.

387
00:18:27,722 --> 00:18:30,324
WELL, HIS TRAVELING
MUST BE HARD ON YOU.

388
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,728
YES, IT'S HARD
ON ALL OF US.

389
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,998
DO YOU GET LONELY?

390
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:40,084
WELL, IT'S ALL...

391
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,088
VERY COMPLICATED.

392
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,457
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
I UNDERSTAND IT MYSELF.

393
00:18:46,508 --> 00:18:48,409
WELL, MAYBE THE SHOW
CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT.

394
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,462
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT SAY
WHEN YOU TURN A CAMERA ON THINGS,

395
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:54,248
THE TRUTH JUST RISES
TO THE SURFACE.

396
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,766
WHAT, LIKE DUMPLINGS?

397
00:18:57,853 --> 00:19:00,304
SO...

398
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:03,558
DO YOU HAVE
A WIFE AND KIDS?

399
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:05,109
NO NO.

400
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,445
MY MARRIAGE COLLAPSED.

401
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,230
OH.

402
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:11,699
YES, IT TURNED OUT THAT
WE WEREN'T THE RIGHT FIT.

403
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,950
I'M SORRY.

404
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,986
YES, IT WAS--

405
00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:17,989
WELL, THERE REALLY ARE
NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE IT.

406
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,991
YOU DON'T STRIKE ME
AS A MAN

407
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:23,377
THAT WOULD EVER BE
AT A LOSS FOR WORDS.

408
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,497
IN THIS CASE I AM.

409
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:31,419
UM...

410
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:33,754
THE ADJECTIVE?

411
00:19:33,788 --> 00:19:37,008
WELL, YOU USED A WORD
TO DESCRIBE ME.

412
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:39,644
ON THE PHONE
YOU MENTIONED--

413
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,314
WELL, I GET FLOWERY
WHEN I'M IN MY SELLING MODE.

414
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:47,685
WELL, WHAT WAS THE WORD?

415
00:19:47,736 --> 00:19:50,688
IT WAS "SULTRY."

416
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,824
- SULTRY?
- MM-HMM.

417
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,826
BUT I SAID SMART TOO.

418
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,412
I LIKE SULTRY.

419
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,868
<i>It's kind of late there.</i>

420
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,986
<i>Have you been prowling
the streets all night?</i>

421
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,906
<i>- LANCE TOOK ME TO A SHOW.
- How's he doing?</i>

422
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:12,877
<i>- FOUND A JOB YET?
- No, but he's making lots of friends.</i>

423
00:20:12,928 --> 00:20:15,096
GOOD GOOD.
ANY GIRLS?

424
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,830
THAT'S STILL
MY HOPE, YOU KNOW,

425
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,799
THAT IF HE COULD JUST
MEET THE RIGHT GIRL AND--

426
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,551
YOU KNOW,
I THINK HE HAS.

427
00:20:20,602 --> 00:20:22,520
<i>Really?</i>

428
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,639
YES, SHE WAS
IN THE SHOW TONIGHT.

429
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:27,007
<i>Well, finally some
encouraging news.</i>

430
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,893
WHAT ELSE? HAS THAT
GILBERT BEEN AROUND?

431
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,897
UH, MM-HMM.

432
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:36,684
<i>- You betcha. - HOW MUCH HAVE
YOU HAD TO DRINK, PATTY?</i>

433
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:40,020
<i>ENOUGH TO PUT ME TO SLEEP.</i>

434
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,908
<i>I LOVE IT HERE, MOM.</i>

435
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:47,578
I WISH I COULD STAY
AT THE CHELSEA FOREVER.

436
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:53,200
YOU REALLY NEVER FELT AT HOME
IN SANTA BARBARA, DID YOU?

437
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,169
I MEAN,
LOOKING BACK ON IT,

438
00:20:55,203 --> 00:20:59,373
THERE WERE THINGS THAT
I COULD'VE DONE DIFFERENTLY,

439
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:03,844
BUT I JUST ALWAYS FELT
THAT I STOOD APART

440
00:21:03,878 --> 00:21:06,847
FROM THE REST
OF THE FAMILY SO MUCH.

441
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:10,518
I MEAN, MAYBE YOU GUYS
COULD'VE--

442
00:21:10,552 --> 00:21:14,188
COULD'VE WHAT?

443
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:16,440
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

444
00:21:16,491 --> 00:21:19,026
DOESN'T MATTER ANYWAY.
IT'S ALL OKAY NOW.

445
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:22,947
BY THE WAY, DAD WANTS
TO PASS THROUGH NEW YORK

446
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:24,782
ON ONE OF HIS
UPCOMING TRIPS.

447
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:28,736
DO ME A FAVOR-- DON'T GET HIM
A ROOM AT THE CHELSEA HOTEL.

448
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,755
YOU KNOW, I STILL NEVER
KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO HIM.

449
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,456
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK
TO YOUR FATHER.

450
00:21:32,507 --> 00:21:35,409
HE'S SUCH A CONVERSATIONALIST,
HE'LL TAKE CARE OF THE WHOLE THING.

451
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:39,046
BUT THAT'S NOT
ACTUALLY TALKING, MOM.

452
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,599
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S KILLING TIME.

453
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,602
WELL, SOMETIMES

454
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,388
THAT'S THE BEST
YOU CAN ASK FOR.

455
00:21:56,931 --> 00:21:59,433
THE BOYS
ARE SO SO LAZY.

456
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:03,404
BUT YOU HAVE TO TRY TO
LEAD THEM AS FAR AS YOU CAN.

457
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:06,791
YOU STILL HAVE ALL THAT
HEAVY EQUIPMENT TO GET?

458
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,161
OH, HELLO.

459
00:22:10,212 --> 00:22:11,779
WELCOME HOME,
PATRICIA.

460
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,947
OH, YOU'RE A VISION.

461
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,802
DID YOU MAKE YOUR
CONNECTING FLIGHT OKAY?

462
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,970
WHY, YES, WE DID.

463
00:22:21,556 --> 00:22:25,343
OH.

464
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:27,144
DID YOU MAKE YOUR
CONNECTING FLIGHT OKAY?

465
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,646
<i>YES.</i>

466
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,981
HOW ABOUT I TAKE YOU GUYS
TO LUNCH? YOU LOOK EXHAUSTED.

467
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,150
<i>THEY CAN'T SPEAK TO YOU
WHEN THEY'RE FILMING, BILL.</i>

468
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,819
OH, TAKE TWO.

469
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,238
HOW ABOUT I TAKE MY
BEAUTIFUL WIFE TO LUNCH?

470
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:41,442
- ON CAMERA OR OFF?
- MY LIFE'S AN OPEN BOOK.

471
00:22:41,476 --> 00:22:43,828
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.
WE'LL PUT A LITTLE CAMI BEHIND IT

472
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,946
AND EVERYTHING WILL BE
ABSOLUTELY FINE.

473
00:22:47,816 --> 00:22:49,083
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A MINUTE?

474
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,835
MICHELLE,
WOULD YOU PLEASE?

475
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,788
<i>WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TRY IT ON?</i>

476
00:22:53,822 --> 00:22:57,258
<i>PATS.
PATSY.</i>

477
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:00,227
- VAL, HI.
- HI THERE, VAL.

478
00:23:00,262 --> 00:23:02,663
- BILL.
- HI THERE, VAL.

479
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,882
SO I WAS GOING
TO CALL YOU.

480
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:06,333
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS UP TO?

481
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:08,552
<i>OH, JUST GRABBING
A BITE AT EL PASEO.</i>

482
00:23:08,603 --> 00:23:10,438
WELL, DO STOP BY
WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

483
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,523
I CAN SET YOU UP
WITH A NEW SPRING OUTFIT,

484
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,725
COMPLETE WITH PURSE,
HAT AND SHOES,

485
00:23:14,776 --> 00:23:16,143
ALL ON THE HOUSE.

486
00:23:16,177 --> 00:23:18,011
<i>OH MY GOODNESS.
WHY?</i>

487
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:21,282
BECAUSE I'D LOVE AMERICA TO
SEE MY NEW SPRING LINE IS WHY.

488
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:24,952
AND BILL PROMISED HE COULD
GET ME A WARDROBE CREDIT.

489
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,455
OH, THAT'S MY BILL.

490
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,573
- DID I?
- ALWAYS FULL OF PROMISES.

491
00:23:29,624 --> 00:23:32,159
WELL WELL WELL,
IT'S AMERICA'S PERFECT FAMILY.

492
00:23:32,193 --> 00:23:35,863
- HI THERE, JEREMY. HOW'S IT GOING?
- HI, BILL.

493
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,215
- SO NICE TO SEE YOU.
- HI.

494
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,885
HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO BE A MOVIE STAR?

495
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,537
WELL...

496
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,892
YOU GOT A NICE TAN
WHILE I WAS AWAY.

497
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,678
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,
KIDDO.

498
00:23:50,712 --> 00:23:52,480
THIS STRIKE'S
GONNA DO ME IN.

499
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,931
<i>ARE WE GONNA
GO BROKE, BILL?</i>

500
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:57,435
<i>YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT.
LANCE LIVING IT UP IN NEW YORK--</i>

501
00:23:57,486 --> 00:23:59,320
I HOPE HE KNOWS HE'S
ON A SHORT STRING THERE.

502
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,322
WE JUST DON'T HAVE
THE MONEY ANYMORE.

503
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,223
HE LOVES MANHATTAN.

504
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,910
HE'S SO HAPPY HE BURSTS
INTO SONG SOMETIMES.

505
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,828
HE HAS SUCH
A SPARK OF LIFE,

506
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,864
LIKE NO ONE
I'VE EVER KNOWN,

507
00:24:09,898 --> 00:24:11,782
SO OPEN AND FUNNY.

508
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,334
THAT'S GREAT,

509
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,569
BUT HE'S GOT TO START
THINKING ABOUT A JOB TOO.

510
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,588
THESE KIDS GOT TO LEARN
THE VALUE OF WORK.

511
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:21,408
I TELL GRANT THAT HE CAN
MAKE $10 AN HOUR

512
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,761
HAULING CEMENT FOR DAVID WITZELL,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE DOES?

513
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,963
HE GIVES ME THAT
WOLFMAN JACK DOG CALL--

514
00:24:26,014 --> 00:24:28,081
"NO WAY, BROTHER.
NO WAY.

515
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:31,602
I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE AND
I'M PLAYING WITH THE BAND."

516
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,438
THAT BAND IS
HIS DREAM, BILL.

517
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,590
WELL, OKAY, BUT HOW ABOUT
FINDING A DREAM

518
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,926
THAT BRINGS IN
SOME BUCKS?

519
00:24:42,096 --> 00:24:45,649
WELL, HOW ABOUT
RAISING PEOPLE

520
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,651
THAT HAVE A SHOT
AT BEING HAPPY?

521
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,043
HOW ABOUT HAVING PARENTS
THAT MAKE CERTAIN

522
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,496
THEIR KIDS KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG,

523
00:24:58,547 --> 00:25:00,164
WHAT THEY SHOULD
AND SHOULDN'T DO?

524
00:25:00,215 --> 00:25:03,116
I THINK THAT WOULD BE
NICE TOO, DON'T YOU?

525
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,388
I KNOW THESE GUYS THINK
YOUR LITTLE ESCAPADE

526
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,139
IN NEW YORK
WAS MORE EXCITING

527
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,559
THAN FILMING ME
HOLDING DOWN THE FORT HERE,

528
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,844
BUT BELIEVE ME,
THIS WEEK OF BABYSITTING

529
00:25:13,895 --> 00:25:18,148
GAVE ME A BETTER IDEA OF
WHAT GOES ON WHEN I'M GONE.

530
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,967
REALLY?
LIKE WHAT?

531
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,852
LIKE A 16-YEAR-OLD
DAUGHTER

532
00:25:21,903 --> 00:25:24,271
THAT STAYS OUT HALF THE NIGHT
AFTER A DANCE PRACTICE--

533
00:25:24,305 --> 00:25:28,108
2:00 A.M.
ON A SCHOOL NIGHT, PAT?

534
00:25:28,142 --> 00:25:31,478
SURE, IT'S FUN AND EASY
BEING FRIENDS WITH YOUR KIDS,

535
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:35,148
BUT HOW ABOUT GIVING THEM
A LITTLE STRUCTURE?

536
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,154
THIS CONVERSATION
WILL END RIGHT HERE.

537
00:25:42,257 --> 00:25:43,991
<i>I'LL SPEAK TO CRAIG
IN THE MORNING</i>

538
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,210
<i>ABOUT DROPPING THIS
FROM THE FILM.</i>

539
00:25:47,596 --> 00:25:49,680
BAIT ME IN FRONT
OF THE CAMERA AGAIN

540
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,216
AND YOU'LL BE
VERY VERY SORRY, BILL.

541
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:01,275
<i>So you let her walk off
just like that?</i>

542
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,844
CRAIG, SHE LEFT
ON HER OWN VOLITION.

543
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,146
I CAN'T INTERFERE WITH
THE EVENTS AS THEY'RE HAPPENING.

544
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,565
WELL, YOU COULD'VE
FOLLOWED HER.

545
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:09,900
<i>There was finally
genuine drama unfolding</i>

546
00:26:09,951 --> 00:26:11,184
AND YOU DIDN'T
GET IT ON FILM.

547
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,987
BELIEVE ME,
WE GOT PLENTY ON FILM.

548
00:26:13,021 --> 00:26:15,990
<i>Well, actually I think you
barely scratched the surface.</i>

549
00:26:16,024 --> 00:26:17,524
AND I DON'T APPRECIATE
THIS ATTITUDE.

550
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,076
<i>This isn't about
an attitude.</i>

551
00:26:19,127 --> 00:26:21,028
THIS IS ABOUT
DOCUMENTARY ETHICS.

552
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,030
<i>Alan, your job is
to film the Louds--</i>

553
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:26,050
NO JUDGMENTS, NO INVOLVEMENTS,
NO PERSONAL FEELINGS.

554
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,703
<i>- I know-- - THAT'S WHAT W.N.E.T.
CONTRACTED YOU FOR</i>

555
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:33,007
AND THAT'S WHERE YOUR
ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY LIES.

556
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,725
SO LET'S GET
ON THE SAME PAGE HERE

557
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,511
AND YOU SHOOT WHAT I NEED
TO MAKE A SUCCESSFUL FILM.

558
00:26:37,545 --> 00:26:40,380
<i>- HAVE A NICE DAY.
THANK YOU. - Okay, Craig--</i>

559
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,766
<i>WHEN CRAIG GILBERT
HIRED US,</i>

560
00:26:42,817 --> 00:26:45,185
<i>WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT
WE WERE GETTING INTO.</i>

561
00:26:45,219 --> 00:26:46,687
FIRST OF ALL,
WE WERE JUST MARRIED

562
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:49,323
AND I THINK WE HAD SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE EXOTIC IN MIND

563
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,692
FOR OUR HONEYMOON THAN
A ROOMFUL OF FILM EQUIPMENT.

564
00:26:51,726 --> 00:26:53,494
WHAT MADE YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND?

565
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:56,330
THE SUBJECT MATTER, I THINK--
FOR ME ANYWAY.

566
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:59,283
FOR ME IT WAS THE CHANCE
TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING PURE--

567
00:26:59,334 --> 00:27:01,919
<i>CINEMA VERITE,
THE CINEMA OF TRUTH.</i>

568
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,088
HEY, DAD,
YOUR TAXI'S HERE.

569
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,090
<i>- OKAY, HONEY.</i>

570
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,626
ALL RIGHT,
I GOTTA GO.

571
00:27:08,677 --> 00:27:10,077
HELLO?

572
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:13,097
HI, LANCE!

573
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,215
GUYS, IT'S LANCE.
HE'S CALLING COLLECT.

574
00:27:15,249 --> 00:27:16,884
ACCEPT THE CHARGES,
SWEETIE.

575
00:27:16,918 --> 00:27:18,585
<i>- HELLO?
- Hi!</i>

576
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:19,753
HI, GUYS.

577
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:21,922
<i>I have very
exciting news.</i>

578
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,440
WHAT IS IT, HONEY?
DID YOU GET A JOB?

579
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,092
I'M GOING TO PARIS.

580
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,779
- PARIS?
- HE GOT A JOB IN PARIS?

581
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,481
LANCE, ARE YOU
IN HIGH SPIRITS AGAIN?

582
00:27:30,532 --> 00:27:33,400
<i>Am I-- am I--?
Yes, I am in high spirits!</i>

583
00:27:33,434 --> 00:27:35,268
LANCE, LANCE,
IT'S DAD.

584
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:37,237
<i>- Hi, Dad. - WHAT ARE
YOU DOING IN PARIS?</i>

585
00:27:37,271 --> 00:27:40,240
I AM DOING STREET THEATER.
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

586
00:27:40,274 --> 00:27:43,043
I'M DOING IT WITH THIS
REALLY REALLY SUPER
GROUP OF PEOPLE.

587
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,412
IS THAT ONE OF THOSE
"UP WITH PEOPLE" KIND OF DEALS?

588
00:27:45,446 --> 00:27:48,332
<i>You know, I didn't ask,
but I tell them how great you are,</i>

589
00:27:48,383 --> 00:27:50,217
<i>not that I don't say
that Mother isn't.</i>

590
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,720
<i>In fact, I think I say that
Mother's a bit greater even than you,</i>

591
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,471
<i>but you know what I mean.
Hold on a second.</i>

592
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,808
HEY, GUYS,
GET ME A TOASTED ALMOND.

593
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,009
<i>OKAY, HONEY.</i>

594
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:03,063
- CATCH.
- OH, WE'RE RICH!

595
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,599
<i>- Lance.
- WHAT?</i>

596
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:08,018
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
WHO'S FINANCING THIS TRIP.

597
00:28:08,069 --> 00:28:09,987
OH, UH,

598
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,989
THIS REALLY
REALLY NICE,

599
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:16,076
VERY RICH MAN WHOSE NAME
I DON'T REMEMBER.

600
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,829
<i>- HE'S NOT GOING TO PARIS.
- Maybe it's--  oh, I don't know.</i>

601
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,815
<i>- I GOTTA GO.
- Paul or John or Ringo</i>

602
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,000
OR SOMETHING.

603
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,501
HE'S NOT GOING
TO PARIS.

604
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,837
HONEY, YOUR FATHER SAYS
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PARIS.

605
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,989
I'M ACTUALLY FLATTERED.

606
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,675
NO ONE'S EVER
TOLD ME THAT BEFORE.

607
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:36,497
<i>Lance, honey,
how are you really?</i>

608
00:28:36,531 --> 00:28:39,466
<i>Have you been taking
care of that cold?</i>

609
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,501
I JUST NEED YOU TO BE
A LITTLE MORE PATIENT.

610
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,438
YOU'RE BURNING 18 ROLLS
OF FILM PER DAY.

611
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,891
YOU'RE WAY OVER BUDGET AND
YOU'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH DRAMA.

612
00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:49,727
NOW I THINK WE'VE BEEN
MORE THAN PATIENT.

613
00:28:49,778 --> 00:28:51,695
A HUGE PART OF THIS PROCESS
IS ESTABLISHING

614
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,282
A COMFORTABLE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN THE SUBJECT AND THE CAMERA.

615
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,785
SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD
HEAD OUT TO SANTA BARBARA

616
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,370
<i>AND JUST PUSH THAT
RELATIONSHIP ALONG.</i>

617
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:03,857
<i>WELCOME HOME.</i>

618
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,493
OH MY GOD.

619
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:09,880
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? TO HELL
AND BACK? - YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

620
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,882
I'VE BEEN BAKING ON A
JOB SITE FOR THREE DAYS.

621
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,967
WHY DIDN'T YOU
CALL ME, KEMOSABE?

622
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,836
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
JUST A SHORT TRIP.

623
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,838
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T GET A FREE MINUTE.

624
00:29:17,872 --> 00:29:19,890
IT'S BAD OUT THERE,
PATTY.

625
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,925
KERN COUNTY QUARRY
HAD TO CLOSE DOWN

626
00:29:21,976 --> 00:29:23,927
BECAUSE THE TEAMSTERS
HAVE JOINED THE STRIKE

627
00:29:23,978 --> 00:29:25,929
AND I GOT $200,000
WORTH OF EQUIPMENT

628
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,564
SITTING ON A DOCK
IN GALVESTON.

629
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,716
<i>WE CAN'T HIDE IT, MOM.
THEY'VE GOT TO START HAMMERING.</i>

630
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,985
MAN, ARE YOU BURNED.

631
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,905
HIDE WHAT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

632
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:38,391
<i>WELCOME TO
WOODSTOCK WEST, MAN.</i>

633
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,327
A NEW ROCK GROUP IS GONNA
BREAK HERE ON SATURDAY.

634
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,279
YEAH, IT'LL HELP US GET
SOME GIGS THIS SUMMER.

635
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,831
YOU HAVE A GIG
THIS SUMMER, GRANT--

636
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,866
HAULING CEMENT IN ORANGE
COUNTY FOR DAVID WITZELL.

637
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,367
I DON'T THINK SO.

638
00:29:47,401 --> 00:29:49,069
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE
POURING CEMENT, GRANT.

639
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,505
I'M PUTTING YOU TO WORK TOO.
LOOKS LIKE YOUR SUMMER BUSINESS TRIP

640
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,241
IS TO AUSTRALIA WITH BIG TODD TO
HELP HIM PICK UP SOME NEW CLIENTS.

641
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,243
WAIT, HE GOES TO AUSTRALIA
AND I SHOVEL CEMENT?

642
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,744
<i>DO I LOOK LIKE
CEMENT GUY?</i>

643
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:59,713
<i>DO I LOOK LIKE
ARISTOTLE ONASSIS?</i>

644
00:29:59,747 --> 00:30:01,515
<i>- WHO DO YOU THINK PAYS
FOR ALL THIS? - WE DID.</i>

645
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,083
<i>- YOU DID?
- YES.</i>

646
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,551
REALLY?
WITH WHAT MONEY?

647
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:06,220
<i>THE MONEY MOM GAVE US
FOR DOING CHORES.</i>

648
00:30:06,254 --> 00:30:07,638
WHERE DO YOU THINK
MOM GETS HER MONEY?

649
00:30:07,689 --> 00:30:09,973
<i>WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES THAT MAKE?</i>

650
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:13,393
WHY DON'T WE
DISCUSS THIS LATER?

651
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:26,824
WHY WEREN'T YOU
WEARING A SHIRT?

652
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,662
IT WAS A 110°.

653
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:33,997
I DIDN'T KNOW
THE SUN WAS SO HOT.

654
00:30:37,618 --> 00:30:40,137
THAT FEELS NICE

655
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,639
WHEN YOU TOUCH ME
LIKE THAT.

656
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,765
WHY'D YOU STOP?

657
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,736
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO GIVE YOU THE WRONG IDEA.

658
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,771
<i>WHAT IDEA IS THAT?</i>

659
00:30:57,805 --> 00:30:59,940
THAT EVERYTHING
IS OKAY WITH US.

660
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:05,529
<i>YOU PROMISED ME THAT IF WE DID
THIS SHOW YOU'D BE HOME MORE.</i>

661
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:11,785
YOU KNOW, I WAS FLYING
BACK HERE THINKING

662
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:15,255
EVEN IF MY BUSINESS
FALLS APART,

663
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:19,309
I ALWAYS GOT YOU,
I ALWAYS GOT THE FAMILY.

664
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:23,397
<i>THEN WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS
RUNNING AWAY FROM US?</i>

665
00:31:23,431 --> 00:31:27,551
I'D LIKE TO KNOW
WHAT IT IS YOU WANT.

666
00:31:27,602 --> 00:31:30,520
WELL, FOR STARTERS,

667
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:34,591
IT WOULD BE NICE
IF ONCE IN A WHILE

668
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:38,562
<i>YOU LOOKED AT ME LIKE
I WAS WORTH SOMETHING.</i>

669
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,515
A MAN NEEDS THAT
FROM TIME TO TIME.

670
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:51,875
AND WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU THINK
IT IS A WOMAN NEEDS, BILL?

671
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,862
I THINK I UNDERSTAND
WHAT A WOMAN NEEDS.

672
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,200
I THINK WE CAN BOTH
AGREE ON THAT.

673
00:32:02,136 --> 00:32:03,670
OW!

674
00:32:03,704 --> 00:32:06,340
OW OW OW.
STOP IT.

675
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,144
WHAT?

676
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:15,048
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

677
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:17,267
HONEY.

678
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:25,225
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN YOU.

679
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:28,695
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
FOR ME,

680
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:31,398
THE ONLY ONE
THAT EVER MATTERED.

681
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,554
OW.

682
00:32:54,588 --> 00:32:56,589
- OH.
- MY BACK.

683
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,627
HI.

684
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,163
YES, IS VAL AROUND? I'D LIKE
TO TAKE HER UP ON HER OFFER.

685
00:33:20,214 --> 00:33:21,798
<i>HEY, PAT.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.</i>

686
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,051
MY BOYS ARE GIVING
A CONCERT THIS WEEKEND.

687
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,086
<i>IT MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME
TO LOOK GLAMOROUS.</i>

688
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,589
HEY, I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT YOU.
LOOK AT THIS.

689
00:33:29,623 --> 00:33:33,126
<i>I'VE GOT THESE ADORABLE LITTLE PASTEL
JUMPERS WITH MATCHING SHOES</i>

690
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:34,794
AND THERE'S
A TURQUOISE ONE

691
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:36,930
THAT WOULD LOOK
SUPER KEEN ON YOU.

692
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,934
<i>WHAT?
YOU DON'T LIKE IT?</i>

693
00:33:40,968 --> 00:33:42,436
THAT'S QUITE
A SUNBURN, VAL.

694
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,905
YEAH, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

695
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,074
ONE DAY OF GARDENING.
YOU SHOULD SEE MY BACK.

696
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,609
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YOU WANT TO GIVE IT A TRY?

697
00:33:49,643 --> 00:33:52,913
THAT LOOKS LIKE MORE THAN
ONE DAY OF GARDENING TO ME.

698
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,449
TWO AND A HALF.

699
00:33:55,483 --> 00:33:57,834
I LIED.

700
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,203
TWO AND A HALF.

701
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:02,322
THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

702
00:34:02,356 --> 00:34:04,458
YOU SHOULD GET A JOB
WITH COPPERTONE.

703
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,096
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU WANT TO
TRY IT ON? IT COMES IN FIVE COLORS.

704
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,931
<i>- I'LL TAKE ONE OF EACH.
- OH.</i>

705
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,600
AND FORGET THE FREEBIE.
BILL TOLD ME TO USE HIS CREDIT CARD

706
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,769
AND BUY WHATEVER I WANT,
NO MATTER WHAT THE PRICE.

707
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,337
<i>WELL, THAT'S REALLY--</i>

708
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,139
IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,
I'D THINK

709
00:34:19,173 --> 00:34:21,608
HE WAS FEELING A LITTLE BIT GUILTY,
WOULDN'T YOU?

710
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:25,178
OR MAYBE IT'S JUST THAT
HE LOVES ME SO.

711
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:28,982
UM, COME TO THINK OF IT,
I'LL NEED SOME SHOES

712
00:34:29,016 --> 00:34:32,352
AND, UM, YEAH,
SOME LUGGAGE MAYBE.

713
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:36,123
YEAH, I MIGHT BE TRAVELING
SOON WITH THE CHILDREN.

714
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,625
IT'LL BREAK BILL'S HEART
TO BE LEFT HERE ALL ALONE,

715
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,694
BUT I TOLD THE GIRLS WE MIGHT
GO TO TAOS THIS SUMMER.

716
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:44,030
HOW WOULD THAT
WORK FOR YOU?

717
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,218
COULD I SEE YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

718
00:34:56,811 --> 00:34:59,379
WHAT ON EARTH
IS YOUR PROBLEM?

719
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:02,766
<i>YOU OFFERED TO SHOW ME YOUR
SUNBURNED BACK. DO YOU MIND?</i>

720
00:35:02,817 --> 00:35:04,601
I THINK THOSE CAMERAS
FOLLOWING YOU AROUND

721
00:35:04,652 --> 00:35:07,104
HAS MADE YOU
A LITTLE NUTS.

722
00:35:07,155 --> 00:35:09,239
ARE YOU COMING
TO THE CONCERT?

723
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:12,409
I'M NOT SURE
IF I SHOULD.

724
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:15,529
OH, THE BOYS WOULD BE
HURT IF YOU DIDN'T COME.

725
00:35:15,563 --> 00:35:18,115
WE'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
OF YOU AS FAMILY, VAL.

726
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:28,091
¶ WE'LL BE FIGHTING
IN THE STREET ¶

727
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,812
¶ WITH OUR CHILDREN
AT OUR FEET ¶

728
00:35:31,846 --> 00:35:34,681
¶ AND THE MORALS
THAT THEY WORSHIP ¶

729
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,550
¶ WILL BE GONE ¶

730
00:35:39,086 --> 00:35:42,622
¶ I'LL TIP MY HAT
TO THE NEW CONSTITUTION ¶

731
00:35:42,657 --> 00:35:45,992
¶ TAKE A BOW
FOR THE NEW REVOLUTION ¶

732
00:35:46,027 --> 00:35:49,446
<i>¶ SMILE AND GRIN
AT THE CHANGE ALL AROUND ¶</i>

733
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,099
¶ PICK UP MY GUITAR
AND PLAY ¶

734
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:56,319
¶ JUST LIKE YESTERDAY ¶

735
00:35:56,354 --> 00:36:00,874
<i>¶ AND I'LL GET
ON MY KNEES AND PRAY ¶</i>

736
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,580
<i>¶ WE DON'T GET FOOLED
AGAIN... ¶</i>

737
00:36:32,406 --> 00:36:35,408
PAT LOUD?
THE PAT LOUD?

738
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:38,411
I'M CRAIG GILBERT FROM NEW YORK.
I'M A BIG FAN.

739
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,947
I THOUGHT
FANS WERE LOYAL.

740
00:36:40,981 --> 00:36:42,982
IT'S REALLY BEEN
QUITE A WHILE, YOU KNOW?

741
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,118
I KNOW, I KNOW.
I COULDN'T GET AWAY.

742
00:36:45,152 --> 00:36:47,120
BUT I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU
EVERY DAY IN DAILIES

743
00:36:47,154 --> 00:36:48,989
AND YOU ARE AMAZING
IN EVERY FRAME.

744
00:36:49,023 --> 00:36:52,008
ARE ALL MEN BULLSHITTERS, CRAIG,
OR JUST THE ONES IN MY LIFE?

745
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,467
<i>FOR A GROUP TO ATTAIN
SUPER STARDOM,</i>

746
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:02,269
<i>THEY HAVE TO BE
ABOUT ONE PERSON.</i>

747
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:05,004
NOW, THE SUPREMES HAVE IT.
THE EMOTIONS DON'T.

748
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:07,340
SO DO THESE KIDS STAND
A CHANCE AT MAKING IT?

749
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,726
- I'M TOM, BY THE WAY--
PATTY'S BROTHER. - HELLO.

750
00:37:09,777 --> 00:37:12,145
<i>SURE, THEY'RE GREAT. THEY
SHOULD DEFINITELY STICK WITH IT.</i>

751
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:15,198
OH, NOW THAT'S EASY FOR
A GUY WITH NO KIDS TO SAY.

752
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,201
<i>LIFE'S ALL ABOUT CHASING
YOUR DREAMS, RIGHT?</i>

753
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,738
WHY, I EVEN GOT ONE WHO THINKS
I'M GONNA FLY HIM OFF TO PARIS.

754
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:24,040
WELL, ACTUALLY
HE'S IN PARIS.

755
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,292
HE'S WHAT?

756
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,377
AND I SENT A CINEMATOGRAPHER
OFF AFTER HIM.

757
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,195
GOOD FOR OLD LANCE.

758
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:32,532
HE GOT SOMEONE TO PAY FOR
A TRIP OTHER THAN HIS OLD MAN.

759
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,834
<i>FINE BY ME.</i>

760
00:37:34,868 --> 00:37:36,920
- ALAN.
- WELL, IT'S NOT FINE BY ME.

761
00:37:36,971 --> 00:37:39,089
<i>AND I'D LIKE TO SEE
THAT PARIS FOOTAGE.</i>

762
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,874
IN FACT, I'D LIKE TO SEE
ALL THE FOOTAGE AND FIND OUT

763
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:44,094
WHAT THE HELL ELSE
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT MY FAMILY

764
00:37:44,145 --> 00:37:47,213
AND WHAT YOU'RE AIMING FOR
WITH ANY OF THIS.

765
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:48,932
<i>ALL RIGHT.</i>

766
00:37:48,983 --> 00:37:50,934
THINK OF A SPACESHIP
LANDING ON EARTH

767
00:37:50,985 --> 00:37:53,470
1,000 YEARS FROM NOW
AND FINDING A TIME CAPSULE.

768
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:55,739
<i>AND INSIDE THAT TIME
CAPSULE IS A FILM.</i>

769
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,774
AND ON THE FILM
EVERYONE IS SMILING

770
00:37:57,825 --> 00:38:00,527
<i>AND SAFE IN THE CERTAINTY
OF EACH OTHER'S LOVE.</i>

771
00:38:00,561 --> 00:38:02,495
BUT AS IT TURNS OUT,
ALL THE ALIENS FOUND

772
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:06,833
WAS AN OLD EPISODE OF
"THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY."

773
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:09,919
NOW IS THAT WHAT WE REALLY
WANT TO LEAVE BEHIND AS A CULTURE--

774
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:13,906
SOMETHING THAT'S THE COMPLETE
ANTITHESIS OF HOW WE REALLY LIVE,

775
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:17,127
FUMBLING AROUND
IN CONFUSION?

776
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:19,346
OH, THAT'S
FULL OF SHIT.

777
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,015
<i>FUMBLING AROUND
IN CONFUSION?</i>

778
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:24,083
<i>THE LOUDS
ARE NOT CONFUSED</i>

779
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:25,769
AND WE ARE NOT
FUMBLING AROUND.

780
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,253
I AM FINE.

781
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:29,756
<i>MY FAMILY IS FINE.</i>

782
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:31,558
I AM GOING TO COME
TO THE MOTEL

783
00:38:31,592 --> 00:38:33,443
TO LOOK AT SOME FOOTAGE
TOMORROW, CRAIG.

784
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,196
AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING ABOUT
IT THAT GIVES A FALSE IMPRESSION

785
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,316
THAT WE ARE STRUGGLING
TO MAKE SENSE OF OUR LIVES,

786
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:41,618
IT'S NOT GOING
ON THE AIR.

787
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,666
Who did that?

788
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:02,522
Our sons
are criminals.

789
00:39:02,556 --> 00:39:05,008
I have to wash my hair
again tonight.

790
00:39:08,062 --> 00:39:10,513
THERE'S 86,000'
OF FILM THERE, PAT,

791
00:39:10,564 --> 00:39:12,098
<i>EVERY FRAME
AS GOOD AS THAT.</i>

792
00:39:12,132 --> 00:39:14,267
NOW WE COULD
SIT HERE FOR DAYS

793
00:39:14,301 --> 00:39:16,636
AND I'D BE HAPPY TO DO THAT
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO--

794
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:19,138
NO, THAT WON'T BE
NECESSARY.

795
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,974
I'LL SEND A PROJECTOR OVER
WHEN THE PARIS FOOTAGE COMES IN.

796
00:39:25,813 --> 00:39:28,782
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR LAST NIGHT.

797
00:39:28,816 --> 00:39:31,034
I'VE BEEN HAVING
KIND OF A TOUGH TIME.

798
00:39:31,085 --> 00:39:33,319
<i>WELL, THAT'S CLEAR TO SEE.</i>

799
00:39:38,325 --> 00:39:41,428
<i>ARE YOU AND BILL
HAVING PROBLEMS?</i>

800
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:44,097
THE PAINFUL TRUTH IS

801
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:48,385
THAT YES, WE HAVE HAD
A ROCKY PAST AND...

802
00:39:48,436 --> 00:39:51,671
NOW I'M NOT SURE
WHERE WE ARE.

803
00:39:53,941 --> 00:39:56,509
WELL, I CAN'T
SPEAK FOR BILL,

804
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,528
BUT THE PAT LOUD
THAT I SEE IS A VISION

805
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,947
OF A LIBERATED MODERN WOMAN.

806
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,450
PANTSUITS WILL DO THAT.

807
00:40:06,954 --> 00:40:10,907
IN FACT,
I SEE A ROLE MODEL.

808
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:13,126
WOMEN ALL ACROSS AMERICA
ARE GOING TO LOOK TO YOU

809
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,530
FOR A ROADMAP OF HOW TO BE
AND WHO TO BE.

810
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,966
<i>YOU'RE IN THE POSITION
TO SHOW WOMEN,</i>

811
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,034
<i>WHOSE STRENGTH
IS ERODING,</i>

812
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:24,637
HOW TO TAKE BACK
THEIR LIVES.

813
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:30,894
AS USUAL,
YOU ARE VERY ELOQUENT.

814
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,263
WELL, LAST NIGHT YOU ASKED ME
IF I WAS A BULLSHITTER.

815
00:40:33,314 --> 00:40:35,432
<i>ARE YOU?</i>

816
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,902
TEST ME.

817
00:40:40,554 --> 00:40:44,324
WHEN WE FIRST MET I TOLD YOU
WHAT I THOUGHT OF YOU.

818
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,893
WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF ME?

819
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,998
I THOUGHT,

820
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:56,369
"IF THAT GUY CAN FIX
HIS FLABBY BODY,

821
00:40:56,403 --> 00:40:58,955
I'VE MET
MY PERFECT MAN."

822
00:41:04,845 --> 00:41:07,547
I ALWAYS FANTASIZED THAT IF
I COULD FIND THE RIGHT MAN,

823
00:41:07,581 --> 00:41:09,349
I'D LEAVE HIM.

824
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,434
BECAUSE I CANNOT
LIVE ALONE.

825
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:15,355
I ABSOLUTELY
CAN'T DO IT.

826
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,357
I'M GOING THROUGH THIS
STAGE IN MY LIFE NOW

827
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,142
WHERE LANCE HAS LEFT.

828
00:41:19,193 --> 00:41:21,694
SOON THE REST OF MY KIDS
WILL FOLLOW.

829
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,813
AND WHAT
HAVE I GOT LEFT?

830
00:41:23,864 --> 00:41:26,850
I HAVEN'T GOT
ANYTHING LEFT.

831
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:29,519
<i>IT SCARES ME
TO DEATH.</i>

832
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:42,114
- HEY. - DON'T TALK.
JUST LISTEN.

833
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:44,116
I PROMISED THE GIRLS
A TRIP TO TAOS.

834
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:46,503
WE'LL GO AS SOON
AS SCHOOL'S OUT.

835
00:41:46,554 --> 00:41:48,388
I WANT DELILAH TO HAVE
A BREAK FROM BRAD.

836
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,507
SHE CAN TAKE
A FRIEND INSTEAD.

837
00:41:50,558 --> 00:41:52,725
I'LL FIND A HORSE
FOR MICHELE TO RIDE.

838
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,395
GRANT'S WILLING TO GIVE IT
A TRY IN ORANGE COUNTY

839
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,814
SHOVELING CEMENT.

840
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,184
AND KEVIN WILL ACCOMPANY
TODD MAN TO AUSTRALIA.

841
00:42:01,235 --> 00:42:03,603
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME
SOMEBODY LISTENED TO ME.

842
00:42:03,637 --> 00:42:05,438
NOBODY'S LISTENING TO YOU.

843
00:42:05,472 --> 00:42:08,575
I JUST WANT EVERYONE
ACCOUNTED FOR BEFORE I GO,

844
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,810
SO NO ONE'S IN DANGER
OF DESERTION.

845
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:14,697
SO NOW GOING TO WORK
IS DESERTION TO YOU?

846
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,619
I'M GOING AWAY
TO GET SOME CLARITY

847
00:42:19,653 --> 00:42:22,321
<i>ABOUT WHAT IS REAL
AND WHAT ISN'T.</i>

848
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:26,492
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA
TO GET AWAY, PAT.

849
00:42:27,661 --> 00:42:29,796
I'M SURE YOU DO.

850
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,834
YOU THINK THAT'S GOING
TO RIDE ALL RIGHT, HUH?

851
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,943
- BYE-BYE, LITTLE DARLING.
- BYE, DAD.  I'M GONNA MISS YOU.

852
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,062
I LEFT THE NUMBER OF
THE HOUSE WE'RE STAYING AT.

853
00:42:46,113 --> 00:42:49,015
I EXPECT YOU TO CALL ME COLLECT
AS SOON AS YOU GET TO AUSTRALIA.

854
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:51,183
- ALL RIGHT?
- I WILL.

855
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:56,623
- BYE. - WHEN DO YOU
COME TO TAOS?

856
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,958
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE,
YOU CAN ANSWER ME.

857
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:02,194
- WE'LL FLY UP OVER THE WEEKEND.
- NEAT.

858
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:03,913
WHO AM I GONNA TAKE
TO THE FIESTA DAY PARADE?

859
00:43:03,964 --> 00:43:05,798
OH WELL, I MIGHT BE
BACK BY THEN, SO...

860
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,417
THE HECK YOU WILL.

861
00:43:07,468 --> 00:43:09,919
MOM, YOU SAID THAT IF I REALLY
MISSED BRAD THAT I COULD COME BACK.

862
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:12,221
I MADE LUNCH FOR
ALL YOU GUYS BY THE POOL.

863
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,223
- BYE, GRANT.
- BYE.

864
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,542
<i>- BYE, KEVIN.
- DELILAH.</i>

865
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,678
<i>- BYE, DELILAH.
- BYE, BRAD.</i>

866
00:43:18,712 --> 00:43:20,346
<i>BYE, BRAD.</i>

867
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,715
<i>OH, I LOVE YOU, BRAD.</i>

868
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:30,907
NO, RAY DAVIES.
I'M TELLING YOU.

869
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,610
- RAY DAVIES.
- RAY DAVIES?

870
00:43:33,661 --> 00:43:35,361
I DON'T LIKE HIM AS MUCH.

871
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,198
- "CHANGES" IS GOOD.
- "LIFE ON MARS."

872
00:43:39,232 --> 00:43:41,951
<i>"LIFE ON MARS" IS GOOD.</i>

873
00:43:42,002 --> 00:43:44,203
ALAN, SUSAN,

874
00:43:44,237 --> 00:43:46,956
I'M HEADING DOWN TO MY
OFFICE IN ABOUT AN HOUR

875
00:43:47,007 --> 00:43:48,758
AND IF YOU WANT
TO COME ALONG,

876
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:52,578
I'VE GOT SOME PRETTY INTERESTING
STUFF COMING DOWN THE PIKE TODAY.

877
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:55,247
THEY'RE FILMING ME BUYING
A NEW BUSINESS SUIT, DAD.

878
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:56,933
YEAH, AND THEN
BAND PRACTICE.

879
00:43:56,967 --> 00:44:00,186
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD DEAL.

880
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,138
MAYBE TOMORROW, BILL.

881
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,382
HELLO.

882
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:15,768
<i>- CRAIG, IT'S BILL.
- Bill... hi.</i>

883
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:17,704
DID THEY
GET OFF OKAY?

884
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,438
<i>They did, a few hours ago.</i>

885
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:22,659
LISTEN, HOW LONG
ARE YOU AROUND FOR?

886
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:24,293
I'M OUT ON A RED-EYE.
WHY?

887
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,496
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU
COULD DO ME A FAVOR TODAY.

888
00:44:26,547 --> 00:44:29,448
WELL, IF IT'S
IN MY POWER, SURE.

889
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:32,418
WELL, CRAIG,
I HAVE A FRIEND

890
00:44:32,452 --> 00:44:34,671
<i>who would like to get
into show business.</i>

891
00:44:34,722 --> 00:44:36,723
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY
HAVE TO DO ANYTHING.

892
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,641
JUST GIVE HER SOME ADVICE.

893
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,177
ON THE OTHER HAND, IF YOU CAN
DO SOMETHING, THAT'D BE GREAT.

894
00:44:41,228 --> 00:44:42,795
PERSONALLY I THINK
SHE'S A KNOCKOUT.

895
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:45,598
IT'S CLEAR TO YOU I'M NOT
THAT KIND OF PRODUCER, RIGHT?

896
00:44:45,632 --> 00:44:48,985
- BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE
TO KNOW THAT. - YEAH.

897
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,137
AND PATTY DOESN'T HAVE
TO KNOW ABOUT THIS EITHER.

898
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:53,139
<i>I HAVEN'T BEEN
AN ANGEL, CRAIG,</i>

899
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:55,307
<i>BUT I'M SURE YOU'VE
FIGURED THAT OUT,</i>

900
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:59,529
CONSIDERING ALL THE TIME YOU
TWO HAVE BEEN SPENDING TOGETHER.

901
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:05,618
ANYWAY, I LEARNED THE HARD
WAY TO BE VERY CAREFUL,

902
00:45:05,652 --> 00:45:08,621
KEEP ANY SOUVENIRS THAT MIGHT
GET HER STARTED OUT OF SIGHT.

903
00:45:08,655 --> 00:45:10,990
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"SOUVENIRS"?

904
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:13,342
WELL, YOU KNOW,
MATCHBOOKS,

905
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:16,129
SWIZZLE STICKS,
PHOTOS--

906
00:45:16,163 --> 00:45:17,630
<i>STUFF TO LOOK BACK ON</i>

907
00:45:17,664 --> 00:45:19,682
AND SEE THAT THERE WAS
MORE TO THAT BILL LOUD GUY

908
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,684
THAN JUST SOME PACK MULE
SLAVING AWAY

909
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,170
FOR EVERYBODY ELSE'S SHOT
AT SELF-FULFILLMENT.

910
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:28,007
WELL, LIKE I'VE SAID,
EVERY HUSBAND DESERVES A HIDING PLACE.

911
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:30,693
<i>THEY'VE GOT IT FIGURED
OUT RIGHT IN EUROPE--</i>

912
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,995
A MAN'S A MAN
AND FAMILY'S SACRED.

913
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,148
<i>BUT A MAN
IN YOUR SITUATION,</i>

914
00:45:35,182 --> 00:45:37,150
YOUR MARRIAGE BEING
WHAT IT IS,

915
00:45:37,184 --> 00:45:40,319
YOU PROBABLY UNDERSTAND
THAT MORE THAN ANYBODY.

916
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:45,992
I KNOW I'M SHAPING UP TO BE
THE SQUARE OF YOUR SHOW.

917
00:45:46,026 --> 00:45:49,078
MAYBE I'VE GOT MORE
GOING ON THAN YOU THINK.

918
00:45:57,721 --> 00:46:00,173
SALLY IS LIKE
A SISTER TO ME.

919
00:46:01,809 --> 00:46:04,043
- YEAH.
- A BAD SISTER.

920
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:10,650
SO DOESN'T SHE PHOTOGRAPH
GREAT, CRAIG?

921
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:14,003
- DON'T YOU THINK?
- OH, BILLY, THAT ONE?

922
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:15,988
- VERY LOVELY.
- THANKS.

923
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,774
YOU KNOW WHAT I TELL HER
THE PROBLEM IS?

924
00:46:17,825 --> 00:46:19,892
TOO MUCH LIKE
BRIGITTE BARDOT.

925
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:22,895
YES.
YES, I SEE THAT.

926
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:25,698
DO YOUR THING,
YOU KNOW, THE--

927
00:46:25,732 --> 00:46:27,583
- OH BILLY.
- GO AHEAD.

928
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,735
OKAY.

929
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,124
"AND I, OF LADIES

930
00:46:35,175 --> 00:46:37,460
MOST DEJECT
AND WRETCHED,

931
00:46:37,511 --> 00:46:41,080
THAT SUCKED THE HONEY
OF HIS MUSIC VOWS,

932
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:44,300
NOW SEE THAT NOBLE
AND MOST SOVEREIGN REASON

933
00:46:44,351 --> 00:46:47,436
LIKE SWEET BELLS JANGLED

934
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,273
OUT OF TUNE AND HARSH,
THAT--"

935
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,892
YEAH.

936
00:46:52,926 --> 00:46:55,194
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS,
BUT I THINK IT'S GREAT.

937
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,463
IT'S OPHELIA.

938
00:46:57,498 --> 00:46:58,781
- VERY NICE.
- THANK YOU.

939
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,284
- SHAKESPEARE.
- AH.

940
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,286
SO WHAT DO YOU
THINK, CRAIG?

941
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,906
I THINK I MIGHT KNOW SOMEONE THAT
WOULD BE QUITE INTERESTED IN THESE.

942
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,637
¶ SHE'S BOUGHT A HAT
LIKE PRINCESS MARINA'S ¶

943
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:26,125
¶ AND HER NEIGHBORS THINK
IT SUITS HER A TREAT ¶

944
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:29,295

¶ SHE SMILES JUST LIKE
A REAL MILLIONAIRE... ¶

951
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:48,981

A CAMERA THERE. - MY BROTHER'S SO SHY.

00:47:56,489 --> 00:47:58,958
<i>LET'S HEAR IT
FOR LANCE LOUD.</i>

955
00:47:58,992 --> 00:48:02,261
- GO LANCE!
- I LIKED IT.

956
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,463
MOM.

957
00:48:04,497 --> 00:48:06,498
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE NOT
ABOUT TO START WHINING.

958
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:08,467
WELL, YOU SAID THAT
WE COULD TALK ABOUT IT.

959
00:48:08,501 --> 00:48:10,553
<i>AFTER JUST 10 DAYS,
DELILAH?</i>

960
00:48:10,604 --> 00:48:12,388
MOM, 10 DAYS IN TAOS
IS AN ETERNITY.

961
00:48:12,439 --> 00:48:15,641
MISS LOUD, MY MOM SAID I CAN TAKE
THE BUS BACK IF DELILAH COMES WITH.

962
00:48:15,675 --> 00:48:17,843
<i>- HELLO?
- WHO IS IT, SWEETIE?</i>

963
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:20,146
HI.
MR. GILBERT.

964
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:23,366
DAD SAID THAT WE COULD COME BACK
WHENEVER WE WANTED, JUST CALL ANYTIME.

965
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,484
HE SAID HE'D HAVE DINNER
ON THE TABLE.  MOM.

966
00:48:25,518 --> 00:48:27,453
FINE.
TAKE THE BUS TOMORROW.

967
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:28,738
YES!

968
00:48:28,789 --> 00:48:31,457
AT LAST,
A GROWNUP TO TALK TO.

969
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:33,960
<i>- HOW'S YOUR TRIP?
- Fine.</i>

970
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,662
<i>I was kind of hoping that you
might turn up here tomorrow.</i>

971
00:48:36,696 --> 00:48:40,366
<i>- Why? - FEELING A LITTLE SULTRY,
I GUESS.</i>

972
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:42,468
<i>Listen, this is...</i>

973
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:45,871
VERY HARD FOR ME
TO DISCUSS.

974
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:50,092
I'VE BEEN DEBATING
WHETHER TO CALL OR NOT.

975
00:48:50,143 --> 00:48:52,711
<i>But as a friend,
I felt that I should.</i>

976
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:55,381
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S WRONG?

977
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,934
<i>I saw Bill
before I left</i>

978
00:48:57,985 --> 00:49:01,287
AND HE TOOK ME
FOR A RIDE TO MALIBU

979
00:49:01,321 --> 00:49:03,022
<i>to see a friend.</i>

980
00:49:03,056 --> 00:49:05,274
WHO?
ANDY PLATT?

981
00:49:05,325 --> 00:49:07,276
NO NO, NOT ANDY PLATT.

982
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:10,029
HER NAME WAS SALLY.

983
00:49:10,063 --> 00:49:12,949
<i>And she gave me
an 8x10 glossy</i>

984
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,952
AND A TAPE OF HER SINGING
"THE SOUND OF MUSIC."

985
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:22,591
LOOK, I CAN FLY OUT
TO SANTA BARBARA TOMORROW

986
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,543
AND YOU CAN
MEET ME THERE

987
00:49:24,577 --> 00:49:26,245
<i>and we'll talk
things through.</i>

988
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:28,130
<i>I understand
what you're feeling.</i>

989
00:49:28,181 --> 00:49:33,302
I'M STILL RAW
FROM MY OWN SITUATION.

990
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:37,807
<i>- Patty.
- WE'RE FILMING TOMORROW.</i>

991
00:49:37,858 --> 00:49:39,976
WELL, I'M THE PRODUCER.
I CAN CHANGE THE SCHEDULE.

992
00:49:40,027 --> 00:49:41,477
<i>No.</i>

993
00:49:41,528 --> 00:49:43,813
IF SINGING SALLY
EVER SEES ME ON TV,

994
00:49:43,864 --> 00:49:46,949
I WANT HER TO SEE ME HERE
IN THIS BEAUTIFUL PLACE.

995
00:49:57,477 --> 00:49:59,712
HONESTLY, IF I HEAR
ANOTHER ACCORDION,

996
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,998
I'M GOING TO VOMIT ALL
OVER THIS TABLE. I REALLY AM.

997
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:04,934
I'M SERIOUS, CAN'T YOU ASK
YOUR FATHER FOR MORE MONEY?

998
00:50:04,985 --> 00:50:06,719
<i>I'M GETTING BORED HERE.</i>

999
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:08,721
BORED IN PARIS-- WHO KNEW
THAT WAS POSSIBLE?

1000
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:11,073
I ACTUALLY MISS
SANTA BARBARA.

1001
00:50:13,226 --> 00:50:16,795
<i>In Santa Barbara, firefighters
continue to battle a wildfire</i>

1002
00:50:16,813 --> 00:50:19,065
<i>that started in the ridges
above Mountain Drive.</i>

1003
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,300
<i>One home has been lost
and many more are threatened.</i>

1004
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:24,153
<i>Police and firemen
are evacuating residents...</i>

1005
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,743
OH, MOM, IT'S BURNING
AROUND HERE.

1006
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:32,611
<i>I'm here alone.
I don't know what to do.</i>

1007
00:50:32,645 --> 00:50:34,113
PUT YOUR FATHER
ON THE PHONE.

1008
00:50:34,147 --> 00:50:36,032
NO, HE'S NOT HERE EITHER.
HE DIDN'T SHOW UP.

1009
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:37,750
<i>- WHAT?
- He called to say</i>

1010
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:39,752
THAT HE WAS AWAY ON BUSINESS,
BUT HE WOULDN'T SAY WHERE.

1011
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:42,505
SON OF A BITCH. LISTEN,
GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE.

1012
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,757
<i>- THE POLICE ARE HERE.
- I'm still 10 hours away.</i>

1013
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:46,876
OH, MOM, I THINK
THE COPS ARE HERE FOR US.

1014
00:50:46,927 --> 00:50:49,378
GO GO.
FOR GOD'S SAKE, GO.

1015
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:07,379
<i>MOM!</i>

1016
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:11,567
GRANT.

1017
00:51:11,618 --> 00:51:13,569
<i>- OH BABIES.
- MOM.</i>

1018
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,371
- DELILAH. - MOM, THE ENTIRE
HILL WAS BURNING.

1019
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,740
I WAS SO WORRIED.

1020
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:19,492
- WE'RE OKAY.
- IT'S OKAY, MOM.

1021
00:51:19,526 --> 00:51:21,043
I'M FINE.
REALLY, IT'S OKAY.

1022
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:24,380
- OH MY GOD.
- MOM, LANCE IS COMING HOME.

1023
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,864
<i>WHAT?</i>

1024
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:28,334
<i>MY BABIES
ARE COMING HOME.</i>

1025
00:51:36,977 --> 00:51:39,378
<i>A TRUE UNIDENTIFIED
FLYING OBJECT.</i>

1026
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:41,880
OH MY GOSH.

1027
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:44,767
WHO IS THIS?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

1028
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:49,905
HI!  YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

1029
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,824
- I FOUND THIS IN FRANCE.
- OH MY GOD.

1030
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,742
I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE IT.
YOU CAN THROW IT ON.

1031
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,828
<i>YOU CAN WEAR IT
FOR A CONCERT,</i>

1032
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:58,697
JUST TO REALLY SPARK UP
SANTA BARBARA AND ALL THAT.

1033
00:51:58,731 --> 00:52:00,733
<i>HEY, DAD'S HOME.</i>

1034
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:05,204
<i>WELL, IT'S
THE LONE RANGER.</i>

1035
00:52:05,238 --> 00:52:07,590
- HI, DAD.
- MY WORLD TRAVELER.

1036
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,508
HI.

1037
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,093
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
YOU LOOK GOOD.

1038
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,045
OH WAIT, LOOK.
I GOT YOU A PRESENT.

1039
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:16,098
<i>OH, THANK YOU, LANCE.</i>

1040
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,100
THAT'S A SHARP-LOOKING
TIE THERE, LANCE.

1041
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,219
<i>- YOU LIKE IT?
- IT SURE IS.  YEAH.</i>

1042
00:52:20,253 --> 00:52:22,421
<i>- IT HAS LOTS OF COLORS.
- THANK YOU.</i>

1043
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:24,390
THAT'S FOR YOU.

1044
00:52:24,424 --> 00:52:26,142
OOH, WHAT'S THIS,
KEMOSABE?

1045
00:52:26,193 --> 00:52:28,611
<i>$300,000 WORTH
OF SHOVEL TEETH.</i>

1046
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,980
<i>THAT'S MORE THAN WORTH
THE WEEKEND</i>

1047
00:52:31,031 --> 00:52:33,649
<i>IN THE HELL HOLE OF FRESNO,
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?</i>

1048
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:36,619
WELL, I'M SURE
IT WAS HELL, BILL.

1049
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:39,038
SAY, ISN'T THIS
FIESTA DAY?

1050
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:40,573
WHO WANTS TO GO
TO THE PARADE?

1051
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:41,724
<i>PATTY?</i>

1052
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:44,293
WELL, I'M SHOPPING
FOR HELEN HARRISON.

1053
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,278
YOU KNOW, HER HOUSE
BURNED DOWN.

1054
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:48,497
OH YEAH, I HEARD
ABOUT THE FIRE.

1055
00:52:48,548 --> 00:52:50,115
YEAH, I ALMOST DIED.

1056
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:52,501
YOU ALMOST DIED?
WOW.

1057
00:52:52,552 --> 00:52:54,553
WELL, THAT'S AWFUL,
BIG D.

1058
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,156
WHEN I GOT HERE ON WEDNESDAY,
THE WHOLE PATIO WAS COVERED IN ASH.

1059
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:59,225
IS THAT WHY
THAT POOL'S SO GREEN?

1060
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,177
NO, THAT'S ALGAE.

1061
00:53:01,228 --> 00:53:04,146
THE POOL MAN LEFT A NOTE.
HE COULDN'T GET IN.

1062
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,315
APPARENTLY YOU LOCKED
THE PATIO

1063
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,801
WHEN YOU WENT TO,
UM, FRESNO.

1064
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:12,488
BY THE LOOKS OF THINGS,
THAT WAS QUITE SOME TIME AGO.

1065
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,990
<i>WELL, I MADE IT BACK
FOR FIESTA.</i>

1066
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,825
HOW ABOUT I FLIP
SOME BURGERS

1067
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,810
FOR THE COMMUNITY BUFFET
AT EL PASEO TONIGHT?

1068
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:22,198
WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT, BILL? WHY DON'T
YOU FLIP SOME BURGERS FOR THE BUFFET?

1069
00:53:22,249 --> 00:53:25,117
I'M SURE THE CREW WOULD LOVE
TO GET A NICE SHOT OF THAT.

1070
00:53:25,151 --> 00:53:27,620
<i>YOU KNOW WHAT THE SAD
TRUTH IS?</i>

1071
00:53:27,654 --> 00:53:29,338
<i>THE KIDS ADORE
THEIR DADDY.</i>

1072
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,173
<i>EVEN LANCE,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.</i>

1073
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,708
BUT SOMEWHERE
ALONG THE LINE

1074
00:53:32,759 --> 00:53:34,710
HE LOST THE LINK
TO ANYTHING THAT'S REAL--

1075
00:53:34,761 --> 00:53:38,547
TO ME, TO THEM,
TO HIS HOME.

1076
00:53:38,598 --> 00:53:41,467
<i>AND I'VE FINALLY GIVEN UP
ON PULLING HIM BACK.</i>

1077
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,106
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

1078
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:52,478
WOW, THE MENU
HASN'T CHANGED.

1079
00:53:52,512 --> 00:53:55,731
OH, YOU'VE BEEN
HERE BEFORE.

1080
00:53:55,782 --> 00:53:58,817
I ACTUALLY--

1081
00:53:58,851 --> 00:54:01,070
I PICKED UP A MAN
IN THAT BAR ONCE.

1082
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:05,874
REALLY?

1083
00:54:07,961 --> 00:54:11,029
WELL, I'M ASTONISHED.

1084
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:12,548
WHAT, THAT I COULD
DO SUCH A THING?

1085
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,050
NO, THAT YOU WOULD
TELL ME.

1086
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,420
BACK WHEN I CAUGHT BILL
RUNNING AROUND,

1087
00:54:18,471 --> 00:54:22,374
HE KEPT GOING ON AND ON
ABOUT AN OPEN MARRIAGE.

1088
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:24,977
I GUESS I WAS
ALREADY IN ONE,

1089
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,396
JUST DIDN'T KNOW IT.

1090
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,431
ANYWAY, HE ACTUALLY
ENCOURAGED ME

1091
00:54:29,482 --> 00:54:31,717
TO PARTICIPATE.

1092
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:33,385
I GAVE IT A TRY.

1093
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:35,738
IT WASN'T FOR ME.

1094
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,523
AND THEN I--

1095
00:54:37,557 --> 00:54:39,491
I GAVE HIM
AN ULTIMATUM.

1096
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:44,113
I THINK THAT MEN HANDLE
AGING DIFFERENTLY THAN WOMEN.

1097
00:54:44,164 --> 00:54:45,698
ALAN, ALAN, ALAN,
ALAN, ALAN.

1098
00:54:45,732 --> 00:54:47,733
READY?
HERE WE GO.

1099
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,287
<i>- WOW.
- NO NO, WAIT.</i>

1100
00:54:51,338 --> 00:54:53,372
<i>CUT.  ROLL AGAIN.
HERE WE GO.</i>

1101
00:54:53,406 --> 00:54:56,175
READY?  ALAN, READY?
ALAN, READY?

1102
00:54:59,346 --> 00:55:00,912
LANCE, ARE YOU
SEEING THIS?

1103
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:02,798
WHERE'S PATTY?
SHE LOVES THIS.

1104
00:55:05,852 --> 00:55:08,187
AH, THERE SHE IS.

1105
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,308
SHE CERTAINLY ISN'T
WINNING ANY POINTS

1106
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:15,594
FOR ELEGANCE NOW,
IS SHE?

1107
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:18,530
YOU'D THINK I'D BE HAPPY
SHE'S NO BEAUTY QUEEN.

1108
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:25,321
SOMEHOW IT JUST MAKES
IT ALL A LITTLE WORSE.

1109
00:55:28,041 --> 00:55:31,677
DID I DO THE WRONG THING
SHOWING IT TO YOU?

1110
00:55:31,711 --> 00:55:34,380
NO, I--

1111
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,999
I'VE BUILT AN ENTIRE LIFE
LOOKING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION.

1112
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:39,518
I THINK IT'S TIME
I LOOKED THEM IN THE EYE.

1113
00:55:39,552 --> 00:55:41,587
WELL, THERE'S MORE
TO TELL

1114
00:55:41,621 --> 00:55:43,255
IF YOU'RE READY
TO HEAR IT.

1115
00:55:43,289 --> 00:55:46,675
I'D REALLY LIKE TO HEAR
THAT TAPE OF HER SINGING.

1116
00:55:46,726 --> 00:55:49,428
NO, YOU WOULDN'T.

1117
00:55:49,462 --> 00:55:52,147
I COULD REALLY
USE A LAUGH.

1118
00:55:53,566 --> 00:55:55,684
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

1119
00:55:55,735 --> 00:55:58,520
IT'S UP IN MY ROOM.
I'LL GO GET IT.

1120
00:55:58,571 --> 00:56:00,656
WAIT, I'LL GO WITH YOU.

1121
00:56:01,808 --> 00:56:05,944
- REALLY?
- WELL, WHY NOT?

1122
00:56:05,978 --> 00:56:08,914
I'M USED TO RAISING
EYEBROWS IN THIS PLACE.

1123
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,451
ALL RIGHT.

1124
00:56:14,754 --> 00:56:17,989
DID YOU READ THAT LAST ONE? YOU
DIDN'T READ THAT LAST ONE, DID YOU?

1125
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:20,175
<i>KAY, I INSIST
YOU SIT RIGHT HERE.</i>

1126
00:56:21,994 --> 00:56:24,213
VIVA LA FIESTA,
PATRICIA.

1127
00:56:41,114 --> 00:56:43,181
<i>I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE
TO SAY IT, KAY,</i>

1128
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:46,318
BUT I ENVIED YOUR HUSBAND
FROM THE MOMENT WE MET.

1129
00:56:46,352 --> 00:56:48,287
AND I PITIED
YOUR WIFE.

1130
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:50,622
OH, SHE'S ALWAYS
MAD AT ME, KAY.

1131
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,541
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY.

1132
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:55,544
I'M AT A DANGEROUS AGE.

1133
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,413
14 IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT.

1134
00:56:57,464 --> 00:56:59,681
- ARE YOU GETTING THIS?
- UNBELIEVABLE.

1135
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:01,834
TELL JERRY I HOPE
HE FEELS BETTER.

1136
00:57:01,868 --> 00:57:04,086
PAN RIGHT AND PREPARE
TO SHIT YOUR PANTS.

1137
00:57:04,137 --> 00:57:06,138
<i>WHAT THE HELL DOES
HE THINK HE'S DOING?</i>

1138
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:07,840
- SOMETHING TO EAT?
- SOME STEAKS.

1139
00:57:07,874 --> 00:57:09,007
- RARE?
- THANK YOU.

1140
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:11,560
KEEP IT COMING.
THANK YOU, SENOR.

1141
00:57:14,647 --> 00:57:17,683
HEY, DARLING, I SAVED
THIS SPACE JUST FOR YOU.

1142
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,237
HERE, USE THIS.

1143
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,940
OH, THERE YOU ARE.
WHAT'S THAT FOR?

1144
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:29,027
- HER PHONE NUMBER.
- THERE YOU GO AGAIN.

1145
00:57:29,061 --> 00:57:31,497
OH, LOOK WHO'S HERE--
CECIL B. DeMILLE.

1146
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:34,249
WELCOME TO FIESTA,
MR. DeMILLE.

1147
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,234
- VIVA LA FIESTA, BILL.
- VIVA LA FIESTA.

1148
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:38,253
CRAIG, YOU CAN'T BE
IN THE SHOT.

1149
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,339
JUST FRAME ME OUT.

1150
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:42,925
PATTY AND I HAD A LONG TALK
AND SHE WANTS ME HERE.

1151
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,344
- WHAT FOR?
- MORAL SUPPORT.

1152
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:47,379
PUT THAT THING ON YOUR
SHOULDER AND SHOOT.

1153
00:57:47,413 --> 00:57:50,382
- WHERE HAVE YOU TWO BEEN?
- GETTING A DRINK.

1154
00:57:50,416 --> 00:57:52,584
<i>GETTING A DRINK?</i>

1155
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:55,921
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I'M PRETTY DAMN HAPPY RIGHT NOW.

1156
00:57:55,939 --> 00:58:00,442
JUST A BARREL OF LAUGHS,
HUH, PATTY?

1157
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:04,196
- BECAUSE LIFE WITH YOU
IS A SAD COMEDY. - WHAT?

1158
00:58:06,265 --> 00:58:09,284
I'M JUST SORRY THAT EVERYBODY
REALLY HAS TO GO THROUGH

1159
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:14,439
THIS RIDICULOUS,
CLOWN-LIKE CIRCUS.

1160
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:16,107
YOU KNOW,
I ACTUALLY REMEMBER

1161
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:17,910
WHEN YOU WERE FUN,
PATRICIA--

1162
00:58:17,944 --> 00:58:19,745
THE FIRST
ON THE DANCE FLOOR

1163
00:58:19,779 --> 00:58:21,830
AND THE LAST
TO LEAVE THE PARTY.

1164
00:58:21,881 --> 00:58:24,466
I THINK YOU MIGHT BE CONFUSING
ME WITH SOMEBODY ELSE, BILL.

1165
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,785
<i>NO, THAT WAS YOU
UNTIL YOU TURNED INTO THIS.</i>

1166
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:29,054
WHAT DID I
TURN INTO, BILL?

1167
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:31,507
SOMEONE THAT LIVES
TO PUT ME DOWN,

1168
00:58:31,558 --> 00:58:33,625
BRING ME DOWN.

1169
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:35,627
<i>AH, WELL,</i>

1170
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:38,463
I DON'T SEEM TO BE DOING
VERY WELL AT THAT.

1171
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:41,567
<i>YOU'RE DOING
JUST FINE TODAY,</i>

1172
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:44,102
<i>THAT'S FOR SURE.</i>

1173
00:58:44,136 --> 00:58:47,606
<i>IN FACT, I THINK I'M GONNA
SIT SOMEWHERE ELSE.</i>

1174
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,575
WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT?

1175
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:51,443
I THINK SHE'S
OVER THERE SOMEWHERE.

1176
00:58:51,477 --> 00:58:55,080
<i>SAVE YOU FROM HAVING TO SNOOP
AROUND MY CLOSET AND OPEN MY DRAWERS.</i>

1177
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:57,332
SEND ME TO THE ELECTRIC
CHAIR FOR TRYING TO HAVE

1178
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,451
A LITTLE FUN
LIKE I'M HAVING TODAY

1179
00:58:59,485 --> 00:59:00,953
BECAUSE I'M MARRIED
TO A DOWNER.

1180
00:59:00,987 --> 00:59:02,821
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT, PATTY?

1181
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:04,957
I THINK YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT.

1182
00:59:04,991 --> 00:59:07,926
I THINK YOU ARE
A PATHETIC FOOL,

1183
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,878
SAD, LUDICROUS,

1184
00:59:09,929 --> 00:59:12,848
- IDIOTIC, INCOMPREHENSIBLE.
- WHAT ELSE?

1185
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:15,183
SCHIZOPHRENIC,
SADOMASOCHISTIC--

1186
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,168
<i>GIVE ME THAT PEN.</i>

1187
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:18,804
I WANT TO WRITE
THIS DOWN, PATTY.

1188
00:59:18,838 --> 00:59:21,056
THIS IS
IMPORTANT STUFF.

1189
00:59:21,107 --> 00:59:23,475
WELL, DON'T LEAVE OUT
GODDAMN ASSHOLE!

1190
00:59:23,509 --> 00:59:25,510
THAT'S IT.  WE'RE DONE.
WE'RE LEAVING.

1191
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:28,680
VERY GOOD. WHAT WAS THAT?
SCHIZOPHRENIC?

1192
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:30,749
DO YOU KNOW HOW
TO SPELL THAT, PAT?

1193
00:59:30,783 --> 00:59:33,735
ALAN, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

1194
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,621
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS,
CRAIG.

1195
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:37,355
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
GET THE SECOND CAMERA.

1196
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:39,207
WE'RE OUT OF FILM.

1197
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,860
THAT'S BULLSHIT.

1198
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:43,495
- GET BACK IN THERE.
- WHOA WHOA.

1199
00:59:43,529 --> 00:59:44,997
THIS IS WHAT
WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

1200
00:59:45,031 --> 00:59:46,999
THE BEST STUFF
IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

1201
00:59:47,033 --> 00:59:50,002
SUSAN AND I HAVE ESTABLISHED
A TRUST WITH THIS FAMILY, CRAIG.

1202
00:59:50,036 --> 00:59:53,005
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? WE ACTUALLY
CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM.

1203
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:55,173
WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM
DESTROYED BY YOUR FILM.

1204
00:59:55,207 --> 00:59:56,592
THEY'RE DESTROYING
THEMSELVES.

1205
00:59:56,643 --> 00:59:58,844
THEY'VE BEEN DESTROYING
THEMSELVES LONG BEFORE WE GOT HERE

1206
00:59:58,878 --> 01:00:00,312
AND THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY
NOT SHY ABOUT IT.

1207
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:01,880
THEY FORGOT WE WERE
EVEN THERE, MAN!

1208
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:04,066
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT, ISN'T IT?
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

1209
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,052
WE'RE FINALLY SUCCESSFUL
AND YOU'RE FUCKING IT ALL UP.

1210
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:09,154
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM?

1211
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:11,823
I DO.  I CARE
ABOUT ALL OF THEM.

1212
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,725
BUT THERE'S A MUCH
BIGGER PICTURE HERE

1213
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:15,661
THAT YOU DON'T
EVEN UNDERSTAND.

1214
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:18,363
ONLY TO YOU, CRAIG.

1215
01:00:18,397 --> 01:00:20,532
YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK, ALAN?

1216
01:00:20,566 --> 01:00:23,118
I THINK YOU SAW SOMETHING
IN THERE THAT TERRIFIED YOU.

1217
01:00:23,169 --> 01:00:25,570
AND IF I WERE YOU, SUSAN,
I'D BE VERY WORRIED.

1218
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:26,872
- THAT'S IT!
- WHOA WHOA WHOA.

1219
01:00:26,906 --> 01:00:28,373
- ALAN!  GUYS!
- SON OF A BITCH!

1220
01:00:28,407 --> 01:00:29,841
- ALAN, COME ON.
- ARE YOU OKAY?

1221
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:32,060
<i>CONGRATULATIONS, TOMMY.
YOU JUST GOT YOUR BOSS'S JOB.</i>

1222
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:34,129
PICK UP THE CAMERA
AND LET'S GO BACK INSIDE.

1223
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:38,133
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THAT'S MY EQUIPMENT.

1224
01:00:38,184 --> 01:00:40,886
<i>- ALL RIGHT, CALL THE POLICE.
GO, CALL THE POLICE. - REALLY, CRAIG?</i>

1225
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,722
YOU WANT US TO SPREAD THE WORD
ABOUT YOUR DOCUMENTARY TECHNIQUE,

1226
01:00:43,756 --> 01:00:46,257
ABOUT HOW YOU OVERSTEP
ALL ACCEPTABLE BOUNDARIES?

1227
01:01:20,727 --> 01:01:23,628
- DO YOU NEED HELP,
MRS. LOUD? - OH.

1228
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:26,598
YES, MY HUSBAND SENT ME
FOR SOMETHING HE FORGOT.

1229
01:02:35,468 --> 01:02:36,885
HELLO.

1230
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:39,971
I'M DOING IT--
LEAVING HIM.

1231
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:43,008
<i>And I want to do it
on camera.</i>

1232
01:02:43,042 --> 01:02:45,177
THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANT TOO,

1233
01:02:45,211 --> 01:02:46,711
ISN'T IT,
AFTER ALL, CRAIG?

1234
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:49,765
PATTY, I WOULD NEVER
ASK YOU TO DO THAT.

1235
01:02:49,816 --> 01:02:51,767
BUT NOT TELLING
THE CHILDREN--

1236
01:02:51,818 --> 01:02:55,103
I NEED TO DO
THAT ALONE.

1237
01:02:55,154 --> 01:02:58,323
AND MY BROTHER
ALONE TOO.

1238
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:00,742
<i>No cameras.</i>

1239
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:03,361
BUT BILL--

1240
01:03:03,395 --> 01:03:05,997
YOU CAN FILM THAT, BABY--

1241
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:07,949
ME TELLING HIM
TO GO TO HELL,

1242
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,584
NEVER COME BACK.

1243
01:03:11,237 --> 01:03:14,572
I WANT THE WOMEN OF AMERICA
TO SEE THAT.

1244
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:17,375
THAT'S WHAT I WANT
HIS BIMBOS TO SEE.

1245
01:03:17,409 --> 01:03:20,095
ALL RIGHT, PATTY,
WE NEED TO GET TOGETHER
AND TALK ABOUT THIS.

1246
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:21,630
<i>Not you.</i>

1247
01:03:21,681 --> 01:03:23,381
JUST ME AND BILL

1248
01:03:23,415 --> 01:03:26,084
AND ALAN AND SUSAN,
NO ONE ELSE.

1249
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:28,303
<i>All right.
Whatever you wish.</i>

1250
01:03:38,531 --> 01:03:44,069
<i>¶ WAY OVER YONDER... ¶</i>

1251
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:49,107
<i>THE HARDEST THING
THAT I CAN THINK OF IN LIFE</i>

1252
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:51,743
<i>IS DISAPPOINTING THE PEOPLE
THAT I LOVE THE MOST</i>

1253
01:03:51,777 --> 01:03:54,445
<i>IN THE WHOLE WORLD.</i>

1254
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:57,448
AND I'M ABOUT
TO DO THAT.

1255
01:03:57,466 --> 01:03:59,301
DIVORCED?
WE CAN'T GET DIVORCED.

1256
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,336
WE'RE THE AMERICAN FAMILY.

1257
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:08,426
I'LL GO TO GLENDALE
IN THE MORNING

1258
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:11,629
AND SPEAK WITH UNCLE TOM
AND AUNT YVONNE FIRST.

1259
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:16,101
<i>AND...</i>

1260
01:04:16,135 --> 01:04:18,103
<i>I'LL TELL YOUR DAD
TOMORROW NIGHT</i>

1261
01:04:18,137 --> 01:04:21,489
<i>WHEN HE COMES HOME.</i>

1262
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:24,326
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY,
SWEETIE.

1263
01:04:27,146 --> 01:04:28,997
MOM.

1264
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:33,535
<i>¶ WAY OVER YONDER ¶</i>

1265
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:39,324
<i>¶ THAT'S WHERE
I'M BOUND. ¶</i>

1266
01:04:48,267 --> 01:04:49,968
WHAT THE HELL?

1267
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:54,139
<i>TOM?</i>

1268
01:04:54,173 --> 01:04:57,192
ALAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1269
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:58,810
I'M LOADING THE MAG.

1270
01:04:58,844 --> 01:05:01,012
WHY?  WE'RE NOT FILMING
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

1271
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:04,032
CRAIG CALLED ME.
HE TOLD YOU APPROVED THIS.

1272
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,683
CRAIG'S HERE?

1273
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:09,037
OH, YOU ARE
UNBELIEVABLE!

1274
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,989
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET,
BUT LET'S HAVE A DRINK

1275
01:05:11,023 --> 01:05:12,657
AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT.
HERE.

1276
01:05:12,691 --> 01:05:14,542
- YOU GAVE YOUR WORD.
- JUST LET ME EXPLAIN.

1277
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:17,879
- I SAID NO FILMING HERE.
- JUST HEAR ME OUT, PLEASE.

1278
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,530
<i>NO, YOU HEAR ME OUT!</i>

1279
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:21,699
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WANT TO DO,

1280
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:24,719
IS HEAR YOU OUT
IN YOUR OWN WORDS,

1281
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,372
SPOKEN TO PEOPLE WHO WON'T
INTERRUPT YOU OR ARGUE WITH YOU

1282
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:30,258
OR SHUT YOU DOWN OR WALK
OUT WITHOUT LISTENING,

1283
01:05:30,309 --> 01:05:32,710
BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT BILL'S GOING TO DO

1284
01:05:32,728 --> 01:05:34,562
WHEN YOU GIVE HIM
HIS WALKING PAPERS.

1285
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,881
AND THEN NO ONE WILL KNOW
ABOUT ALL THE YEARS OF LIES

1286
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:39,818
AND HUMILIATIONS AND BETRAYALS
THAT BROUGHT YOU TO THIS.

1287
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:43,438
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ALL THOSE FANCY
WORDS ABOUT THE THRESHOLD OF PRIVACY, HUH?

1288
01:05:43,489 --> 01:05:45,740
IT HAS TO BE CROSSED.
IT HAS TO BE CROSSED RIGHT NOW

1289
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,226
FOR THIS FILM TO HAVE
ANY KIND OF EMOTIONAL IMPACT.

1290
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:50,395
THEN GO MAKE A GODDAMN
LASSIE MOVIE!

1291
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:52,530
THERE'S REAL SUFFERING
HAPPENING HERE, CRAIG.

1292
01:05:52,564 --> 01:05:54,332
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN
MY KIDS LAST NIGHT.

1293
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:56,618
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I SHOULD'VE SEEN YOUR KIDS.

1294
01:05:56,669 --> 01:05:58,687
AND THE WHOLE WORLD
SHOULD'VE SEEN YOUR KIDS.

1295
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:00,571
AND FRANKLY, WITHOUT THAT
AND WITHOUT THIS,

1296
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:03,158
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THIS THING
IS WORTH PUTTING ON THE AIR.

1297
01:06:03,192 --> 01:06:04,626
<i>- THAT'S FINE BY ME.
- REALLY?</i>

1298
01:06:04,677 --> 01:06:06,261
WHAT ABOUT ALAN
AND SUSAN AND TOMMY

1299
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:09,264
WHO'VE WORKED 24 HOURS A DAY FOR
THE LAST GOD KNOWS HOW MANY MONTHS?

1300
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:11,516
OR ALL THE PEOPLE IN NEW YORK
WHO YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT

1301
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:13,184
WHO'VE BEEN SIFTING
THROUGH MORE FOOTAGE

1302
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:15,920
<i>THAN WAS EVER SHOT
FOR WORLD WAR II?</i>

1303
01:06:15,938 --> 01:06:17,806
AND THE MILLION DOLLARS
THE NETWORK HAS SPENT

1304
01:06:17,857 --> 01:06:19,357
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE
IN YOU?

1305
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:20,925
NOT ME, YOU--

1306
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:22,560
<i>YOU AND YOUR STORY</i>

1307
01:06:22,594 --> 01:06:24,646
<i>AND YOUR ABILITY
TO EXPRESS IT.</i>

1308
01:06:24,697 --> 01:06:26,815
<i>WHAT ABOUT YOUR SONS
WHO THINK THAT THIS FILM</i>

1309
01:06:26,866 --> 01:06:29,567
CAN CHANGE THEIR LIFE?
AND THEY'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

1310
01:06:29,601 --> 01:06:31,453
AND ALL THE WOMEN--

1311
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:33,104
ALL THE WOMEN
WHO ARE OUT THERE

1312
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:35,657
WHO ARE IN THE SAME POSITION
AS YOU ARE RIGHT NOW,

1313
01:06:35,708 --> 01:06:38,410
BUT THEY'RE ALONE AND THEY'RE
LOST AND THEY'RE SCARED

1314
01:06:38,444 --> 01:06:40,912
<i>AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO AND YOU CAN SHOW THEM.</i>

1315
01:06:40,946 --> 01:06:45,000
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.
LET'S NOT PUT IT ON THE AIR.

1316
01:07:01,067 --> 01:07:03,485
ALL RIGHT.

1317
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:06,771
ALL RIGHT.

1318
01:07:06,805 --> 01:07:08,690
<i>BUT YOU LISTEN TO ME.</i>

1319
01:07:08,741 --> 01:07:11,309
<i>LIKE I TOLD YOU BEFORE,
NOT YOU!</i>

1320
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:13,478
JUST SUSAN AND ALAN.

1321
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:22,287
<i>WHEN BILL WOULD
GO AWAY,</i>

1322
01:07:22,321 --> 01:07:25,790
<i>I WAS JUST LEFT AT HOME
WITH MY OWN WORST FEARS.</i>

1323
01:07:25,824 --> 01:07:27,992
UNRETURNED PHONE CALLS,

1324
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:30,795
LATE-NIGHT HANG-UPS--

1325
01:07:30,829 --> 01:07:33,831
<i>IT ALL JUST MADE ME
SO PARANOID.</i>

1326
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:36,217
<i>THAT BLISSFUL DELUSION
OF FAITHFULNESS,</i>

1327
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:38,937
<i>THAT NEED TO BELIEVE</i>

1328
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:42,057
<i>THAT EVERYTHING
IS GOING TO BE OKAY--</i>

1329
01:07:42,108 --> 01:07:45,060
IT DIED THE NIGHT
OF THE FILES.

1330
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:49,697
<i>LIFE DOESN'T GO ON
THE WAY YOU PLAN IT.</i>

1331
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:53,701
WHEN YOU REFUSE
TO ACCEPT IT,

1332
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:57,855
YOU JUST BECOME
THIS UNLOVABLE PERSON.

1333
01:07:57,873 --> 01:08:00,358
I'VE MADE MISTAKES--

1334
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:02,360
<i>A LOT OF THEM.</i>

1335
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:05,130
I THOUGHT IF BILL COULDN'T
LIVE UP TO THE TRUTH,

1336
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:07,215
AT LEAST HE COULD LIVE UP
TO THE FACADE.

1337
01:08:10,302 --> 01:08:13,188
<i>HOW DID THE KIDS
TAKE ALL OF THIS?</i>

1338
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:15,140
HARD.

1339
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:17,375
YOU KNOW WHO TOOK IT
THE HARDEST OF ALL, DON'T YOU?

1340
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:19,260
LANCE?

1341
01:08:19,311 --> 01:08:22,430
HE'S THE ONE
HE UNDERSTOOD THE LEAST.

1342
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:25,716
<i>HEY.</i>

1343
01:08:30,556 --> 01:08:32,557
I'M CUTTING.

1344
01:08:36,662 --> 01:08:38,530
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

1345
01:08:38,564 --> 01:08:40,248
LISTEN, I KNOW
THAT WASN'T EASY.

1346
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:41,732
COME ON.

1347
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:44,669
ACTUALLY, I THINK
IT WAS MY BEST SCENE.

1348
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:46,921
PATTY, I KNOW
YOU'RE UPSET.

1349
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:50,041
<i>BUT AFTER TONIGHT,
THE HARD PART IS OVER.</i>

1350
01:08:50,075 --> 01:08:52,544
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

1351
01:08:54,713 --> 01:08:57,799
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.
LET'S GO.  COME ON.

1352
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:02,137
COME ON, WE'VE GOT TO GET
TO THE HOUSE BEFORE BILL.

1353
01:09:02,188 --> 01:09:03,638
COME ON!

1354
01:09:03,689 --> 01:09:06,441
BARBARA, IT'S PATTY.

1355
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,526
LISTEN,
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

1356
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:11,312
YOU NEED TO TELL BILL
NOT TO COME HOME TONIGHT.

1357
01:09:11,363 --> 01:09:13,314
<i>I CHANGED MY MIND
ABOUT SOMETHING</i>

1358
01:09:13,365 --> 01:09:15,567
<i>AND I DON'T
WANT HIM HOME.</i>

1359
01:09:15,601 --> 01:09:17,285
HEY, MAN, YOUR MOM.

1360
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,204
GRANT, HONEY,
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

1361
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:21,156
EXCUSE US.

1362
01:09:21,207 --> 01:09:23,274
I NEED YOU TO BE THE ONE
TO TELL YOUR FATHER.

1363
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:25,276
- WHAT?
- I KNOW.

1364
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:27,278
HOW CAN YOU ASK ME
TO DO THAT, MOM?

1365
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:29,130
HOPEFULLY BARBARA WILL
HAVE GOTTEN TO HIM IN TIME

1366
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,382
AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING,
SWEETIE. BUT IF SHE HASN'T--

1367
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:33,218
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO SAY TO HIM?

1368
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:36,287
THE TRUTH.  TELL HIM THAT I'M
TELLING HIM TO MOVE OUT AND THAT I--

1369
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:39,007
I DON'T WANT TO HUMILIATE HIM
IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA, HONEY.

1370
01:09:39,058 --> 01:09:42,510
YOU'LL BE DOING YOUR FATHER
A FAVOR THAT HE'LL NEVER FORGET.

1371
01:09:47,233 --> 01:09:51,469
<i>¶ SOMEBODY HOLDS
THE KEY ¶</i>

1372
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:56,608
<i>¶ BUT I CAN'T FIND
MY WAY HOME ¶</i>

1373
01:09:56,642 --> 01:10:02,163
<i>¶ STILL I CAN'T
FIND MY WAY HOME ¶</i>

1374
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:05,833
<i>¶ AND I AIN'T DONE
NOTHING WRONG... ¶</i>

1375
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:08,369
MY BIG MAN'S BEEN HAULING
CONCRETE FOR A LIVING,

1376
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:11,039
- YEAH.
- STRONG AS AN OX.

1377
01:10:14,326 --> 01:10:17,328
HAS YOUR MOTHER BEEN
DRIVING THE MERCEDES?

1378
01:10:17,346 --> 01:10:19,714
GRANT?

1379
01:10:19,765 --> 01:10:21,933
UH, THE MERCEDES.

1380
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:24,669
YEAH.  YES.

1381
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:27,171
DID YOU TALK TO YOUR
SECRETARY TODAY?

1382
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:29,190
NO, I HAVEN'T.
WHY?

1383
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:31,809
NOTHING.
I WAS JUST WONDERING

1384
01:10:31,843 --> 01:10:33,861
<i>HOW EVERYTHING WAS
GOING AT THE OFFICE.</i>

1385
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:37,615
I DON'T THINK YOU'VE EVER
ASKED ME THAT BEFORE.

1386
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:40,184
IT MUST BE BECAUSE YOU'RE
EARNING YOUR KEEP THIS SUMMER.

1387
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:42,120
<i>NOW YOU CAN APPRECIATE
WHAT IT TAKES</i>

1388
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:44,021
<i>TO BRING HOME
A BUCK OR TWO.</i>

1389
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:46,207
I SOMETIMES WONDER
IF YOUR MOTHER HAD TO WORK

1390
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:49,327
WHETHER SHE'D HAVE MORE
APPRECIATION FOR THE OLD MAN.

1391
01:10:50,462 --> 01:10:52,080
HOW'S SHE DOING,
BY THE WAY?

1392
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:55,550
MOM?  SHE'S GOOD.

1393
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:57,702
YOU KNOW MOM.

1394
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:01,372
I SURE DO.
I SURE DO.

1395
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:07,878
<i>¶ The changing ¶</i>

1396
01:11:07,896 --> 01:11:10,181
<i>¶ Of sunlight ¶</i>

1397
01:11:10,215 --> 01:11:12,550
<i>¶ To moonlight ¶</i>

1398
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:17,488
<i>¶ Reflections
of my life ¶</i>

1399
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:22,744
<i>¶ Oh, how they fill
my eyes... ¶</i>

1400
01:11:27,866 --> 01:11:30,868
Nixon devalued the dollar today.
Did you know that?

1401
01:11:37,993 --> 01:11:42,714
<i>WELL, IT'S LIT UP
LIKE CHRISTMAS IN HERE.</i>

1402
01:11:43,915 --> 01:11:48,136
<i>HOW ARE YOU DOING?
YOU ALL RIGHT?</i>

1403
01:11:48,187 --> 01:11:51,606
- I WASN'T EXPECTING
TO SEE YOU. - WHY NOT?

1404
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,025
COME ON, BILL.
WE BOTH KNOW.

1405
01:11:54,059 --> 01:11:57,028
<i>- KNOW WHAT?
- YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM?</i>

1406
01:11:57,062 --> 01:11:59,080
<i>DIDN'T YOU GET A CALL
FROM BARBARA?</i>

1407
01:11:59,114 --> 01:12:01,599
<i>I DIDN'T TALK
TO HER TODAY.</i>

1408
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:03,601
DIDN'T GRANT
SAY ANYTHING?

1409
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:05,570
GRANT?
ABOUT WHAT?

1410
01:12:05,604 --> 01:12:07,739
- BIG D!
- HI, DAD.

1411
01:12:07,773 --> 01:12:10,625
- OH.
- IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

1412
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:13,444
AT LEAST SOMEBODY IS GLAD
TO SEE ME COME HOME.

1413
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:16,447
NOW WHAT'S THIS ABOUT
BARBARA NOW? WHAT DID--?

1414
01:12:16,482 --> 01:12:18,666
BILL, DON'T YOU KNOW?

1415
01:12:18,717 --> 01:12:20,551
<i>WHAT?</i>

1416
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,721
DON'T BE PLAYING
WITH ME, BILL.

1417
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:27,008
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1418
01:12:27,059 --> 01:12:29,344
<i>YOU DON'T KNOW
THERE'S A PROBLEM?</i>

1419
01:12:29,395 --> 01:12:32,096
NO.  WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

1420
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:34,482
WHAT--?

1421
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:37,235
<i>WELL, THIS IS KEEN.</i>

1422
01:12:37,269 --> 01:12:41,406
UH, LOOK, LET'S NOT
SPILL ANY BLOOD HERE.

1423
01:12:42,974 --> 01:12:45,660
I'VE BEEN TO SEE A LAWYER.
THIS IS HIS CARD.

1424
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:47,945
YOU CAN GIVE HIM
A CALL TOMORROW.

1425
01:12:47,979 --> 01:12:49,614
<i>OH.</i>

1426
01:12:49,648 --> 01:12:51,582
I WANT YOU TO MOVE OUT--

1427
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:54,369
<i>TONIGHT, NOW.</i>

1428
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:58,623
JUST TURN AROUND AND GET OUT.

1429
01:12:59,991 --> 01:13:01,992
REALLY?

1430
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:03,994
<i>WE'RE DONE, BILL.</i>

1431
01:13:04,012 --> 01:13:06,214
<i>THE MARRIAGE IS OVER.</i>

1432
01:13:06,265 --> 01:13:09,467
- JUST LIKE THAT?
- JUST LIKE THAT.

1433
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:15,139
22 YEARS
JUST LIKE THAT.

1434
01:13:15,173 --> 01:13:17,341
JUST LIKE THAT.

1435
01:13:20,696 --> 01:13:22,730
WELL,

1436
01:13:22,781 --> 01:13:24,365
FAIR DEAL.

1437
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,068
<i>I FIGURED
YOU'D THINK THAT.</i>

1438
01:13:27,119 --> 01:13:32,022
WELL, I THINK THAT

1439
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:36,828
IT'S A LITTLE--

1440
01:13:36,862 --> 01:13:39,213
A LITTLE SHORTSIGHTED
ON YOUR PART.

1441
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:42,383
<i>- DO YOU, BILL?
- I REALLY DO.</i>

1442
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:56,380
WELL, AT LEAST
YOU DIDN'T PICK
THE MOST EXPENSIVE ONE.

1443
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:58,549
HE'LL BE IN HIS
OFFICE TOMORROW,

1444
01:13:58,567 --> 01:14:01,068
EXPECTING A CALL
FROM YOU.

1445
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:02,887
I'VE BEEN TO THE BANK,

1446
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:05,273
MADE COPIES
OF OUR TAX FORMS.

1447
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:08,726
RIGHT.

1448
01:14:11,997 --> 01:14:13,948
AND YOU'VE GOT
THE KIDS

1449
01:14:13,999 --> 01:14:17,535
PRETTY SHAPED UP,
HAVE YOU?

1450
01:14:17,569 --> 01:14:19,954
THEY ALL UNDERSTAND
THE PROBLEM,

1451
01:14:20,005 --> 01:14:22,573
THAT IT'S ONLY
BETWEEN US.

1452
01:14:24,343 --> 01:14:27,244
WELL, I GUESS I DON'T
HAVE TO UNPACK NOW, DO I?

1453
01:15:01,079 --> 01:15:03,280
HEY, GUYS.

1454
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:05,166
<i>HOW ARE WE DOING
IN HERE, BIG D?</i>

1455
01:15:05,217 --> 01:15:07,919
NOT SO GOOD, DAD.

1456
01:15:07,953 --> 01:15:10,438
NONE OF US ARE.

1457
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:20,982
YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO KNOW THE
NUMBER TO THE LEMON TREE, DO YOU?

1458
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:25,820
THEY ALREADY HAVE
A ROOM FOR YOU.

1459
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:31,659
<i>OH.</i>

1460
01:15:33,111 --> 01:15:35,279
<i>THAT'S HANDY.</i>

1461
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,117
I HAVE TO GO, DAD.

1462
01:15:40,151 --> 01:15:44,505
- WELL, STAY IN TOUCH NOW.
- YEAH.

1463
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:47,258
- HONEY.
- YEAH?

1464
01:15:49,845 --> 01:15:51,629
WE'RE ALL GONNA BE FINE.

1465
01:15:54,132 --> 01:15:56,166
BYE, DAD.

1466
01:15:59,187 --> 01:16:01,305
PATTY...

1467
01:16:03,508 --> 01:16:05,610
IF GLEN BERNSON
CALLS ME,

1468
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:09,480
<i>MAKE SURE HE CALLS ME
AT THE LEMON TREE.</i>

1469
01:16:09,514 --> 01:16:12,116
<i>WE'VE GOT A HUGE ORDER
IN DAYTON.</i>

1470
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:16,020
<i>AND MERRIWETHER--
YOU REMEMBER HIM--</i>

1471
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:19,240
HE'S GOING TO TRY
TO SELL BERNSON

1472
01:16:19,291 --> 01:16:23,077
THE SAME DAMN THING,
AND WE CAN'T HAVE THAT HAPPEN.

1473
01:16:23,128 --> 01:16:25,746
WE REALLY CAN'T.

1474
01:18:57,849 --> 01:18:59,817
ANOTHER ONE.

1475
01:18:59,851 --> 01:19:03,037
- LANCE?
- LANCE.

1476
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:05,039
<i>- JUST A SECOND.
- LANCE, CAN I GET A PICTURE?</i>

1477
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:07,575
<i>- THANK YOU.
- ONE MORE, PLEASE.</i>

1478
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,880
WOW, LOOKS LIKE
IT'S A HIT ALREADY.

1479
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:15,699
<i>WELCOME TO TONIGHT'S

01:19:30,816 --> 01:19:32,566
<i>- CAMERON, LOOK AT THIS.
- BEFORE WE BEGIN,</i>

1485
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:34,485
<i>I WOULD BE REMISS
IN NOT THANKING THE LOUDS.</i>

1486
01:19:34,519 --> 01:19:37,354
<i>- YOU SEE THIS?
- THEIR COURAGE STILL INSPIRES ME</i>

1487
01:19:37,388 --> 01:19:39,790
<i>AND THEIR TRUST
HUMBLES ME.</i>

1488
01:19:39,825 --> 01:19:42,910
<i>SO WITHOUT
FURTHER ADO,</i>

1489
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:46,113
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
"AN AMERICAN FAMILY."

1490
01:19:58,176 --> 01:20:00,344
<i>Six, five, four, three...</i>

1491
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:03,747
<i> It's another New Year's Eve
for the Loud family.</i>

1492
01:20:03,765 --> 01:20:06,383
<i>But this year will be
much different.</i>

1493
01:20:06,417 --> 01:20:09,937
<i>For the very first time,
Pat and her husband Bill</i>

1494
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:12,256
<i>are living separately
after 20 years of marriage...</i>

1495
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:14,225
<i>"PATTY LOUD SEES NO WAY</i>

1496
01:20:14,259 --> 01:20:16,310
<i>OUT OF A FALSE MARRIAGE
EXCEPT BOOZE."</i>

1497
01:20:16,361 --> 01:20:19,063
<i>- Please, Lance.
- HOLD ON, LISTEN TO THIS.</i>

1498
01:20:19,097 --> 01:20:23,150
"LANCE OOZES HIS
LEECH-LIKE HOMOSEXUALITY

1499
01:20:23,201 --> 01:20:27,738
WITH THE GLEE OF A GROTESQUE,
GOYA-ESQUE EMOTIONAL DWARF."

1500
01:20:27,772 --> 01:20:30,491
WHAT?  NO NO NO.
OH MY GOD.

1501
01:20:30,542 --> 01:20:32,276
<i>Oh my God,
what have I done?</i>

1502
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:34,795
I NEVER WANT TO SEE
THAT MAN AGAIN.

1503
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:38,799
MOM, I'M--
I'M COMING HOME.

1504
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:41,969
AND WE'RE GONNA WATCH
THE SHOW WHEN IT AIRS

1505
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:43,787
TOGETHER, ALL OF US,

1506
01:20:43,805 --> 01:20:46,390
<i>ALL OF US AS A FAMILY.</i>

1507
01:20:46,424 --> 01:20:48,893
<i>They are an American family,</i>

1508
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:50,895
<i>the family next door
on the surface.</i>

1509
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:53,013
<i>10 million viewers
watch them every week</i>

1510
01:20:53,064 --> 01:20:55,482
<i>on the most popular,
most watched series</i>

1511
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:57,852
<i>that educational television
has ever tackled.</i>

1512
01:20:57,903 --> 01:21:01,021
<i>And those 10 million people
have heard the Louds say things</i>

1513
01:21:01,072 --> 01:21:04,608
<i>that many people wouldn't tell
their lovers or tax accountants.</i>

1514
01:21:04,642 --> 01:21:06,160
You are a pathetic fool.

1515
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:08,478
Why don't we
discuss this later?

1516
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:10,664
<i>You don't know
there's a problem?</i>

1517
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:12,816
No. What's your problem?

1518
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:15,085
I've been to see a lawyer.
This is his card.

1519
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,872
You can give him
a call tomorrow.

1520
01:21:17,923 --> 01:21:19,456
<i>I want you
to move out.</i>

1521
01:21:19,490 --> 01:21:22,343
It's a West-coast bourgeois
all-American freefall.

1522
01:21:22,377 --> 01:21:25,296
There is a tremendous amount
wrong with this family

1523
01:21:25,330 --> 01:21:26,764
<i>and very little right.</i>

1524
01:21:26,798 --> 01:21:29,967
<i>I for one view them
as a true American tragedy.</i>

1525
01:21:30,001 --> 01:21:33,220
But they have one child
who has not turned out well.

1526
01:21:33,271 --> 01:21:34,939
What they didn't
realize is that

1527
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:37,841
people were not
going to look at it
as an art form,

1528
01:21:37,859 --> 01:21:40,177
that they were going
to begin criticizing them
as people.

1529
01:21:40,195 --> 01:21:41,896
People dissected
this family

1530
01:21:41,947 --> 01:21:43,530
in order to call
into question

1531
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:46,400
<i>not only an American family,
but the American family.</i>

1532
01:21:46,451 --> 01:21:48,736
<i>...role as a father, but that
that role was of a pal.</i>

1533
01:21:48,787 --> 01:21:50,537
<i>Have you seen Lance Loud
and that get-up?</i>

1534
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:52,456
<i>Here was a family
with very serious problems.</i>

1535
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:54,491
<i>Is there or is there not such
a thing as a sense of shame?</i>

1536
01:21:54,525 --> 01:21:57,461
<i>It's just-- it's shocking.
And I wouldn't want anybody...</i>

1537
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:53,133
<i>SO SENSATIONALISM WAS
HIS GOAL FROM THE GET-GO.</i>

1538
01:22:53,184 --> 01:22:55,052
IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
THAN THAT.

1539
01:22:55,086 --> 01:22:57,421
HE WANTED TO CREATE
A SUCCESSFUL SHOW,

1540
01:22:57,439 --> 01:22:59,974
BUT HE WAS ALSO
ON A PERSONAL MISSION.

1541
01:23:00,025 --> 01:23:01,692
COULD THAT EXPLAIN
WHAT WENT WRONG?

1542
01:23:01,726 --> 01:23:04,695
<i>CRAIG DIDN'T SEARCH
FOR THE PERFECT FAMILY.</i>

1543
01:23:04,729 --> 01:23:07,898
HE SEARCHED FOR THE FAMILY
THAT WAS PERFECT FOR HIS AGENDA.

1544
01:23:07,932 --> 01:23:09,817
<i>ANYBODY WANT PIZZA?</i>

1545
01:23:09,868 --> 01:23:12,602
<i>- PIZZA? - OH MY GOD,
I'M AFRAID TO ANSWER IT.</i>

1546
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:19,126
- HELLO? - HAVE YOU READ
THIS STUFF, PATTY?

1547
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:21,128
<i>- IT'S YOUR FATHER.
- Get this-- "The father,</i>

1548
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:23,130
COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH
WITH ANY WORLD

1549
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:25,749
EXCEPT THE FALSE ONE
HE INHABITS, REACHES OUT..."

1550
01:23:25,783 --> 01:23:28,002
WHY DON'T WE INVITE
YOUR DAD TO PIZZA?

1551
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:31,171
HMM?

1552
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:33,624
<i>WELL, WE ARE A
CULTURAL PHENOMENON</i>

1553
01:23:33,658 --> 01:23:37,127
<i>AND THE MOST DESPISED
FAMILY IN AMERICA.</i>

1554
01:23:37,145 --> 01:23:39,296
IT'S REALLY ALL TOO
GLAMOROUS TO HANDLE.

1555
01:23:39,314 --> 01:23:40,797
REALLY.
HONESTLY.

1556
01:23:40,815 --> 01:23:42,866
I DON'T WANT
TO BE DESPISED.

1557
01:23:42,901 --> 01:23:46,020
WELL, THEN WE'LL JUST
HAVE TO FIGHT BACK.

1558
01:23:46,071 --> 01:23:48,655
WON'T WE, SWEETHEART?

1559
01:23:57,499 --> 01:23:59,983
<i>"The Dick Cavett Show!"</i>

1560
01:24:01,652 --> 01:24:04,321
WE'RE DOING THIS SHOW
AND A DOZEN OTHERS LIKE IT

1561
01:24:04,339 --> 01:24:06,206
BECAUSE WE WANT
PEOPLE TO KNOW

1562
01:24:06,257 --> 01:24:09,159
THAT WE ARE NOT
MONSTERS OR IDIOTS.

1563
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:11,211
<i>WE'RE PRETTY
DECENT PEOPLE</i>

1564
01:24:11,262 --> 01:24:13,347
AND DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
WHAT WE WERE SIGNING UP FOR.

1565
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:15,599
WE'VE LOST DIGNITY,
AND-- AND--

1566
01:24:15,633 --> 01:24:18,385
AND WE'VE BEEN HUMILIATED
AS A RESULT OF IT.

1567
01:24:18,436 --> 01:24:20,971
OUR HONOR
IS AT QUESTION

1568
01:24:21,005 --> 01:24:23,474
<i>AND I FEEL VERY DEFENSIVE,
AS CRAIG BROUGHT UP.</i>

1569
01:24:23,508 --> 01:24:26,443
PEOPLE HAVE A MUCH DIFFERENT
IMAGE OF THEMSELVES

1570
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:28,512
THAN SOMETIMES
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE OF THEM.

1571
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:32,900
I THINK WE'RE MOST HORRIFIED BY THE
THINGS IN OURSELVES THAT WE'RE SCARED OF.

1572
01:24:32,951 --> 01:24:36,320
<i>- WHEN I SAW MYSELF BILLED
AS "HOMO OF THE YEAR 1971..."</i>

1573
01:24:36,354 --> 01:24:38,739
...I WAS REALLY
DESPONDENT FOR A WHILE.

1574
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:41,658
BUT I KNEW WHAT I WAS GOING
TO COME OFF AS ANYWAY.

1575
01:24:41,692 --> 01:24:43,794
THEY'VE SORT OF
CATEGORIZED US.

1576
01:24:43,828 --> 01:24:46,330
<i>ONE THING IS
THAT YOU BECOME OBLIGED</i>

1577
01:24:46,364 --> 01:24:48,499
UNDER THAT CAMERA
TO REACT IN SOME WAY.

1578
01:24:48,533 --> 01:24:50,968
YOU TRY TO COME UP WITH
SOME PLATO-LIKE DECISION

1579
01:24:51,002 --> 01:24:52,386
<i>WHEN THE CAMERA'S
ROLLING.</i>

1580
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,138
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,

1581
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:56,373
ANYBODY WHO'S IN SHOW BUSINESS
WOULD HAVE TO CALL YOU NAIVE

1582
01:24:56,391 --> 01:24:58,842
TO THINK THAT YOU COULD THINK
THAT YOU COULD APPEAR ON TELEVISION

1583
01:24:58,876 --> 01:25:00,811
<i>AND NOT HAVE IT
SELECTED, EDITED.</i>

1584
01:25:00,845 --> 01:25:02,846
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING WRONG
WITH BEING NAIVE.

1585
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:05,215
I SEE SOMETHING REALLY WRONG
WITH BEING SOPHISTICATED.

1586
01:25:05,233 --> 01:25:08,202
CERTAINLY NO OTHER AMERICAN FAMILY
HAS BEEN THOUGH ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

1587
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:12,072
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND
BEING SO OUTSPOKEN AND ACCESSIBLE.

1588
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:14,074
AND WE WILL SEE YOU
TOMORROW NIGHT.

1589

<i>LET'S MILK OUR LAST MINUTE
